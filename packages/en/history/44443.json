Steiger,\r\n  22 & 24 Frankfort Street.\r\n  1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVISED EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first edition of Military Schools in France and Prussia was issued\r\nin 1862, as a number of the American Journal of Education; and\r\nsubsequently in the same year this portion was printed as Part I. of a\r\ncomprehensive survey of the whole field of Instruction in the Science\r\nand Art of War in different countries. The circumstances under which the\r\npublication was begun, are set forth in the Preface to the imperfect\r\nedition of 1862. Now that the survey in the serial chapters of the\r\nJournal is as complete as the material at the command of the Editor, and\r\nthe space which he can give to this special subject enable him to make\r\nit, the several chapters have been revised and brought together in a\r\nsingle volume, to present the actual condition of this important\r\ndepartment of national education in the principal states of Europe, as\r\nwell as in our own country.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the late Col. Samuel Colt, the inventor of the Colt\r\nRevolver, and the founder of the Colt Patent Fire-Arms Factory--two\r\nenterprises which have changed the character and the mode of\r\nconstructing fire-arms in every country--to state that the information\r\ncontained in the first edition of this Treatise, was collected and\r\nprepared at his request, to assist him in maturing the plan of a School\r\nof Mechanical Engineering, which he proposed to establish on his estate\r\nat Hartford, and on which, after the breaking out of the War of\r\nSecession, he decided to engraft both military drill, and military\r\nhistory, and to give that scientific instruction which every graduate of\r\nour national Military and Naval Academies ought to possess. Soon after\r\nCol. Colt’s death (Jan. 10, 1862), Mrs. Elizabeth Jarvis Colt, learning\r\nwhat had been done in the direction of her husband’s wishes, authorized\r\nthe use which has been made, of the material already collected, in the\r\npreparation of this treatise, and of the volume already published on\r\nTechnical Schools in different countries, and of any more which might be\r\ncollected and prepared at her expense, to illustrate any department of\r\nhis plan of a scientific school at Hartford.\r\n\r\n  HENRY BARNARD.\r\n  HARTFORD, CONN., March, 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PAGE.\r\n  INTRODUCTION,                                                      3\r\n\r\n  I.

We have from time to time introduced the subject of\r\nScientific Schools--or of institutions in which the principles of\r\nmathematics, mechanics, physics, and chemistry are thoroughly mastered,\r\nand their applications to the more common as well as higher arts of\r\nconstruction, machinery, manufactures, and agriculture, are\r\nexperimentally taught. In this kind of instruction must we look for the\r\nspecial training of our engineers, both civil and military; and schools\r\nof this kind established in every state, should turn out every year a\r\ncertain number of candidates of suitable age to compete freely in open\r\nexaminations for admission to a great National School, like the\r\nPolytechnic at Paris, or the purely scientific course of the Military\r\nAcademy at West Point, and then after two years of severe study, and\r\nhaving been found qualified by repeated examinations, semi-annual and\r\nfinal, by a board composed, not of honorary visitors, but of experts in\r\neach science, should pass to schools of application or training for the\r\nspecial service for which they have a natural aptitude and particular\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nThe terrible realities of our present situation as a people--the fact\r\nthat within a period of twelve months a million of able bodied men have\r\nbeen summoned to arms from the peaceful occupations of the office, the\r\nshop, and the field, and are now in hostile array, or in actual\r\nconflict, within the limits of the United States, and the no less\r\nalarming aspect of the future, arising not only from the delicate\r\nposition of our own relations with foreign governments, but from the\r\narmed interference of the great Military Powers of Europe in the\r\ninternal affairs of a neighboring republic, have brought up the subject\r\nof MILITARY SCHOOLS, AND MILITARY EDUCATION, for consideration and\r\naction with an urgency which admits of no delay. Something must and will\r\nbe done at once. And in reply to numerous letters for information and\r\nsuggestions, and to enable those who are urging the National, State or\r\nMunicipal authorities to provide additional facilities for military\r\ninstruction, or who may propose to establish schools, or engraft on\r\nexisting schools exercises for this purpose,--to profit by the\r\nexperience of our own and other countries, in the work of training\r\nofficers and men for the ART OF WAR, we shall bring together into a\r\nsingle volume, “_Papers on Military Education_,” which it was our\r\nintention to publish in successive numbers of the NEW SERIES of the\r\n“_American Journal of Education_.”\r\n\r\nThis volume, as will be seen by the Contents, presents a most\r\ncomprehensive survey of the Institutions and Courses of Instruction,\r\nwhich the chief nations of Europe have matured from their own\r\nexperience, and the study of each other’s improvements, to perfect their\r\nofficers for every department of military and naval service which the\r\nexigences of modern warfare require, and at the same time, furnishes\r\nvaluable hints for the final organization of our entire military\r\nestablishments, both national and state.\r\n\r\nWe shall publish in the Part devoted to the United States, an account of\r\nthe Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy at Newport, and\r\nother Institutions and Agencies,--State, Associated, and Individual, for\r\nMilitary instruction, now in existence in this country, together with\r\nseveral communications and suggestions which we have received in\r\nadvocacy of Military Drill and Gymnastic exercises in Schools. We do not\r\nobject to a moderate amount of this Drill and these exercises, properly\r\nregulated as to time and amount, and given by competent teachers. There\r\nis much of great practical value in the military element, in respect\r\nboth to physical training, and moral and mental discipline. But we do\r\nnot believe in the physical degeneracy, or the lack of military aptitude\r\nand spirit of the American people--at least to the extent asserted to\r\nexist by many writers on the subject. And we do not believe that any\r\namount of juvenile military drill, any organization of cadet-corps, any\r\namount of rifle or musket practice, or target shooting, valuable as\r\nthese are, will be an adequate substitute for the severe scientific\r\nstudy, or the special training which a well organized system of military\r\ninstitutions provides for the training of officers both for the army and\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nOur old and abiding reliance for industrial progress, social well being,\r\ninternal peace, and security from foreign aggression rests on:--\r\n\r\nI. The better Elementary education of the whole people--through better\r\nhomes and better schools--through homes, such as Christianity\r\nestablishes and recognizes, and schools, common because cheap enough for\r\nthe poorest, and good enough for the best,--made better by a more\r\nintelligent public conviction of their necessity, and a more general\r\nknowledge among adults of the most direct modes of effecting their\r\nimprovement, and by the joint action of more intelligent parents, better\r\nqualified teachers, and more faithful school officers. This first great\r\npoint must be secured by the more vigorous prosecution of all the\r\nagencies and measures now employed for the advancement of public\r\nschools, and a more general appreciation of the enormous amount of\r\nstolid ignorance and half education, or mis-education which now\r\nprevails, even in states where the most attention has been paid to\r\npopular education.\r\n\r\nII. The establishment of a System of Public High Schools in every\r\nstate--far more complete than exists at this time, based on the system\r\nof Elementary Schools, into which candidates shall gain admission only\r\nafter having been found qualified in certain studies by an open\r\nexamination. The studies of this class of schools should be preparatory\r\nboth in literature and science for what is now the College Course, and\r\nfor what is now also the requirements in mathematics in the Second\r\nYear’s Course at the Military Academy at West Point.\r\n\r\nIII.

MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe French armies are composed of soldiers levied by yearly conscription\r\nfor a service of seven years. Substitutes are allowed, but in accordance\r\nwith a recent alteration, they are selected by the state. Private\r\narrangements are no longer permitted; a fixed sum is paid over to the\r\nauthorities, and the choice of the substitutes made by them.\r\n\r\nThe troops are officered partly from the military schools and partly by\r\npromotion from the ranks. The proportions are established by law.\r\nOne-third of the commissions are reserved for the military schools, and\r\none-third left for the promotion from the ranks. The disposal of the\r\nremaining third part is left to the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe promotion is partly by seniority and partly by selection.\r\n\r\nThe following regulations exist as to the length of service in each rank\r\nbefore promotion can be given, during a period of peace:--\r\n\r\n  A second Lieutenant can not be promoted to Lieutenant\r\n      under 2 years’ service.\r\n  A Lieutenant          “  “  Captain     “  2  “\r\n  A Captain             “  “  Major       “  4  “\r\n  A Major               “  “  Lieut-Col.  “  3  “\r\n  A Lieutenant-Colonel  “  “  Colonel     “  2  “\r\n\r\nBut in time of war these regulations are not in force.\r\n\r\nUp to the rank of captain, two-thirds of the promotion takes place\r\naccording to seniority, and the other one-third by selection.\r\n\r\nFrom the rank of captain to that of major (_chef de bataillon ou\r\nd’escadron_) half of the promotion is by seniority and the other half by\r\nselection, and from major upwards, it is entirely by selection.\r\n\r\nThe steps which lead to the selection are as follows:--The general\r\nofficers appointed by the minister at war to make the annual inspections\r\nof the several divisions of the army of France, who are called\r\ninspectors-general, as soon as they have completed their tours of\r\ninspection, return to Paris and assemble together for the purpose of\r\ncomparing their notes respecting the officers they have each seen, and\r\nthus prepare a list arranged in the order in which they recommend that\r\nthe selection for promotion should be made.\r\n\r\nWe were informed that the present minister of war almost invariably\r\npromoted the officers from the head of this list, or, in other words,\r\nfollowed the recommendation of the inspector-general.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MILITARY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThe principal Military Schools at present existing in France are the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n  1. The Polytechnic School at Paris (_Ecole Impériale Polytechnique_,)\r\npreparatory to--\r\n\r\n  2. The Artillery and Engineers School of Application at Metz (_Ecole\r\nImpériale d’Application de l’Artillerie et du Génie_.)\r\n\r\n  3. The Military School at St. Cyr (_Ecole Impériale Spéciale\r\nMilitaire_,) for the Infantry and Cavalry, into which the Officers’\r\nDepartment of the Cavalry School at Saumur has lately been absorbed.\r\n\r\n  4. The Staff School at Paris (_Ecole Impériale d’Application d’Etat\r\nMajor_.)\r\n\r\n  5. The Military Orphan School (_Prytanée Impériale Militaire_) at La\r\nFlèche.\r\n\r\n  6. The Medical School (_Ecole Impériale de Médicine et de Pharmacie\r\nMilitaires_.) recently established in connection with the Hospital of\r\nVal-de-Grâce.\r\n\r\n  7. The School of Musketry (_Ecole Normale de Tir_) at Vincennes,\r\nfounded in 1842.\r\n\r\n  8. The Gymnastic School (_Ecole Normale de Gymnastique_) near\r\nVincennes.\r\n\r\n  9. The Music School (_Gymnase Musical_.)\r\n\r\n  10. The Regimental Schools (_Ecoles Régimentaires_.)\r\n\r\nThe military schools are under the charge of the minister of war, with\r\nwhom the authorities of the schools are in direct communication.\r\n\r\nThe expenses to the state of the military schools, including the pay of\r\nthe military men who are employed in connection with them, for the year\r\n1851, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  For Polytechnic School at Paris,               _fr._ 554,911. 91\r\n   “  Artillery and Engineers School at Metz,          187,352. 06\r\n   “  Infantry and Cavalry School at St. Cyr,          682,187. 35\r\n   “  Cavalry School at Saumur,                        196,170. 27\r\n   “  Staff School at Paris,                           145,349. 96\r\n   “  Gymnastic School of Musketry at Vincennes,        33,211. 33\r\n   “  Regimental Schools,                              108,911½,30\r\n\r\nFrom this sum, 2,224,542_fr._, should be deducted 421,372_fr._ secured\r\nfrom paying pupils, leaving the total cost to the state to be\r\n1,803,308_fr._, or about $360,000, for about 2,100 pupils. The cost to\r\nthe state for training an officer of Artillery and Engineers is about\r\n$1,500, and that of an officer of the Staff is about $1,400.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECTS AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nIN MATHEMATICS AS PRESCRIBED FOR ADMISSION TO THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL OF\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\n“L’ÉCOLE POLYTECHNIQUE” is too well known, by name at least, to need\r\neulogy in this journal. Its course of instruction has long been famed\r\nfor its completeness, precision, and adaptation to its intended objects.\r\nBut this course had gradually lost somewhat of its symmetrical\r\nproportions by the introduction of some new subjects and the excessive\r\ndevelopment of others. The same defects had crept into the programme of\r\nthe subjects of examination for admission to the school. Influenced by\r\nthese considerations, the Legislative Assembly of France, by the law of\r\nJune 5th, 1850, appointed a “_Commission_” to revise the programmes of\r\nadmission and of internal instruction. The President of the Commission\r\nwas THENARD, its “Reporter” was LE VERRIER, and the other nine members\r\nwere worthy to be their colleagues. They were charged to avoid the error\r\nof giving to young students, subjects and methods of instruction “too\r\nelevated, too abstract, and above their comprehension;” to see that the\r\ncourse prescribed should be “adapted, not merely to a few select\r\nspirits, but to average intelligences;” and to correct “the excessive\r\ndevelopment of the preparatory studies, which had gone far beyond the\r\nend desired.”\r\n\r\nThe Commission, by M. Le Verrier, prepared an elaborate report of 440\r\nquarto pages, only two hundred copies of which were printed, and these\r\nmerely for the use of the authorities. A copy belonging to a deceased\r\nmember of the Commission (the lamented Professor _Theodore Olivier_),\r\nhaving come into the hands of the present writer, he has thought that\r\nsome valuable hints for our use in this country might be drawn from it,\r\npresenting as it does a precise and thorough course of mathematical\r\ninstruction, adapted to any latitude, and arranged in the most perfect\r\norder by such competent authorities. He has accordingly here presented,\r\nin a condensed form, the opinions of the Commission on _the proper\r\nsubjects for examination in mathematics, preparatory to admission to the\r\nPolytechnic School, and the best methods of teaching them_.\r\n\r\nThe subjects which will be discussed are ARITHMETIC; GEOMETRY; ALGEBRA;\r\nTRIGONOMETRY; ANALYTICAL GEOMETRY; DESCRIPTIVE GEOMETRY.\r\n\r\nI. ARITHMETIC.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of Arithmetic is indispensable to every one. The merchant,\r\nthe workman, the engineer, all need to know how to calculate with\r\nrapidity and precision. The useful character of arithmetic indicates\r\nthat its methods should admit of great simplicity, and that its teaching\r\nshould be most carefully freed from all needless complication. When we\r\nenter into the spirit of the methods of arithmetic, we perceive that\r\nthey all flow clearly and simply from the very principles of numeration,\r\nfrom some precise definitions, and from certain ideas of relations\r\nbetween numbers, which all minds easily perceive, and which they even\r\npossessed in advance, before their teacher made them recognize them and\r\ntaught them to class them in a methodical and fruitful order. We\r\ntherefore believe that there is no one who is not capable of receiving,\r\nof understanding, and of enjoying well-arranged and well-digested\r\narithmetical instruction.\r\n\r\nBut the great majority of those who have received a liberal education do\r\nnot possess this useful knowledge. Their minds, they say, are not suited\r\nto the study of mathematics. They have found it impossible to bend\r\nthemselves to the study of those abstract sciences whose barrenness and\r\ndryness form so striking a contrast to the attractions of history, and\r\nthe beauties of style and of thought in the great poets; and so on.\r\n\r\nNow, without admitting entirely the justice of this language, we do not\r\nhesitate to acknowledge, that the teaching of elementary mathematics has\r\nlost its former simplicity, and assumed a complicated and pretentious\r\nform, which possesses no advantages and is full of inconveniences. The\r\nreproach which is cast upon the sciences in themselves, we out-and-out\r\nrepulse, and apply it only to the vicious manner in which they are now\r\ntaught.\r\n\r\nArithmetic especially is only an instrument, a tool, the theory of which\r\nwe certainly ought to know, but the practice of which it is above all\r\nimportant most thoroughly to possess. The methods of analysis and of\r\nmechanics, invariably lead to solutions whose applications require\r\nreduction into numbers by arithmetical calculations. We may add that the\r\nnumerical determination of the final result is almost always\r\nindispensable to the clear and complete comprehension of a method ever\r\nso little complicated. Such an application, either by the more complete\r\ncondensation of the ideas which it requires, or by its fixing the mind\r\non the subject more precisely and clearly, develops a crowd of remarks\r\nwhich otherwise would not have been made, and it thus contributes to\r\nfacilitate the comprehension of theories in such an efficacious manner\r\nthat the time given to the numerical work is more than regained by its\r\nbeing no longer necessary to return incessantly to new explanations of\r\nthe same method.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of arithmetic will therefore have for its essential object,\r\nto make the pupils acquire the habit of calculation, so that they may be\r\nable to make an easy and continual use of it in the course of their\r\nstudies. The theory of the operations must be given to them with\r\nclearness and precision; not only that they may understand the mechanism\r\nof those operations, but because, in almost all questions, the\r\napplication of the methods calls for great attention and continual\r\ndiscussion, if we would arrive at a result in which we can confide. But\r\nat the same time every useless theory must be carefully removed, so as\r\nnot to distract the attention of the pupil, but to devote it entirely to\r\nthe essential objects of this instruction.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that these theories are excellent exercises to form\r\nthe mind of the pupils. We answer that such an opinion may be doubted\r\nfor more than one reason, and that, in any case, exercises on useful\r\nsubjects not being wanting in the immense field embraced by mathematics,\r\nit is quite superfluous to create, for the mere pleasure of it,\r\ndifficulties which will never have any useful application.\r\n\r\nAnother remark we think important. It is of no use to arrive at a\r\nnumerical result, if we cannot answer for its correctness. The teaching\r\nof calculation should include, as an essential condition, that the\r\npupils should be shown how every result, deduced from a series of\r\narithmetical operations, may always be controlled in such a way that we\r\nmay have all desirable certainty of its correctness; so that, though a\r\npupil may and must often make mistakes, he may be able to discover them\r\nhimself, to correct them himself, and never to present, at last, any\r\nother than an exact result.\r\n\r\n   *   *   *\r\n\r\nThe _Programme_ given below is made very minute to avoid the evils which\r\nresulted from the brevity of the old one. In it, the limits of the\r\nmatter required not being clearly defined, each teacher preferred to\r\nextend them excessively, rather than to expose his pupils to the risk of\r\nbeing unable to answer certain questions. The examiners were then\r\nnaturally led to put the questions thus offered to them, so to say; and\r\nthus the preparatory studies grew into excessive and extravagant\r\ndevelopment. These abuses could be remedied only by the publication of\r\nprogrammes so detailed, that the limits within which the branches\r\nrequired for admission must be restricted should be so apparent to the\r\neyes of all, as to render it impossible for the examiners to go out of\r\nthem, and thus to permit teachers to confine their instruction within\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe new programme for arithmetic commences with the words Decimal\r\nnumeration. This is to indicate that the Duodecimal numeration will not\r\nbe required.\r\n\r\nThe only practical verification of Addition and Multiplication, is to\r\nrecommence these operations in a different order.\r\n\r\nThe Division of whole numbers is the first question considered at all\r\ndifficult. This difficulty arises from the complication of the methods\r\nby which division is taught. In some books its explanation contains\r\ntwice as many reasons as is necessary. The mind becomes confused by such\r\ninstruction, and no longer understands what is a demonstration, when it\r\nsees it continued at the moment when it appeared to be finished. In most\r\ncases the demonstration is excessively complicated and does not follow\r\nthe same order as the practical rule, to which it is then necessary to\r\nreturn. There lies the evil, and it is real and profound.\r\n\r\nThe phrase of the programme, Division of whole numbers, intends that the\r\npupil shall be required to explain the practical rule, and be able to\r\nuse it in a familiar and rapid manner. We do not present any particular\r\nmode of demonstration, but, to explain our views, we will indicate how\r\nwe would treat the subject if we were making the detailed programme of a\r\n_course_ of arithmetic, and not merely that of an _examination_. It\r\nwould be somewhat thus:\r\n\r\n“The quotient may be found by addition, subtraction, multiplication;\r\n\r\n“Division of a number by a number of one figure, when the quotient is\r\nless than 10;\r\n\r\n“Division of any number by a number less than 10;\r\n\r\n“Division of any two numbers when the quotient has only one figure;\r\n\r\n“Division in the most general case.\r\n\r\n  “_Note._--The practical rule may be entirely explained by this\r\nconsideration, that by multiplying the divisor by different numbers, we\r\nsee if the quotient is greater or less than the multiplier.”\r\n\r\nThe properties of the Divisors of numbers, and the decomposition of a\r\nnumber into prime factors should be known by the student. But here also\r\nwe recommend simplicity. The theory of the greatest common divisor, for\r\nexample, has no need to be given with all the details with which it is\r\nusually surrounded, for it is of no use in practice.\r\n\r\nThe calculation of Decimal numbers is especially that in which it is\r\nindispensable to exercise students. Such are the numbers on which they\r\nwill generally have to operate. It is rare that the data of a question\r\nare whole numbers; usually they are decimal numbers which are not even\r\nknown with rigor, but only with a given decimal approximation; and the\r\nresult which is sought is to deduce from these, other decimal numbers,\r\nthemselves exact to a certain degree of approximation, fixed by the\r\nconditions of the problem. It is thus that this subject should be\r\ntaught. The pupil should not merely learn how, in one or two cases, he\r\ncan obtain a result to within 1/_n_, _n_ being any number, but how to\r\narrive by a practicable route to results which are exact to within a\r\nrequired decimal, and on the correctness of which they can depend.\r\n\r\nLet us take decimal multiplication for an example. Generally the pupils\r\ndo not know any other rule than “to multiply one factor by the other,\r\nwithout noticing the decimal point, except to cut off on the right of\r\nthe product as many decimal figures as there are in the two factors.”\r\nThe rule thus enunciated is methodical, simple, and apparently easy.\r\nBut, in reality, it is practically of a repulsive length, and is most\r\ngenerally inapplicable.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that we have to multiply together two numbers having each\r\nsix decimals, and that we wish to know the product also to the sixth\r\ndecimal. The above rule will give twelve decimals, the last six of\r\nwhich, being useless, will have caused by their calculation the loss of\r\nprecious time. Still farther; when a factor of a product is given with\r\nsix decimals, it is because we have stopped in its determination at that\r\ndegree of approximation, neglecting the following decimals; whence it\r\nresults that several of the decimals situated on the right of the\r\ncalculated product are not those which would belong to the rigorous\r\nproduct. What then is the use of taking the trouble of determining them?\r\n\r\nWe will remark lastly that if the factors of the product are\r\nincommensurable, and if it is necessary to convert them into decimals\r\nbefore effecting the multiplication, we should not know how far we\r\nshould carry the approximation of the factors before applying the above\r\nrule. It will therefore be necessary to teach the pupils the abridged\r\nmethods by which we succeed, at the same time, in using fewer figures\r\nand in knowing the real approximation of the result at which we arrive.\r\n\r\nPeriodical decimal fractions are of no use. The two elementary questions\r\nof the programme are all that need be known about them.\r\n\r\nThe Extraction of the square root must be given very carefully,\r\nespecially that of decimal numbers. It is quite impossible here to\r\nobserve the rule of having in the square twice as many decimals as are\r\nrequired in the root. That rule is in fact impracticable when a series\r\nof operations is to be effected. “When a number N increases by a\r\ncomparatively small quantity _d_, the square of that number increases\r\nvery nearly as 2N_d_.” It is thus that we determine the approximation\r\nwith which a number must be calculated so that its square root may\r\nafterwards be obtained with the necessary exactitude. This supposes that\r\nbefore determining the square with all necessary precision, we have a\r\nsuitable lower limit of the value of the root, which can always be done\r\nwithout difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe Cube root is included in the programme. The pupils should know this;\r\nbut while it will be necessary to exercise them on the extraction of the\r\nsquare root by numerous examples, we should be very sparing of this in\r\nthe cube root, and not go far beyond the mere theory. The calculations\r\nbecome too complicated and waste too much time. Logarithms are useful\r\neven for the square root; and quite indispensable for the cube root, and\r\nstill more so for higher roots.\r\n\r\nWhen a question contains only quantities which vary in the same ratio,\r\nor in an inverse ratio, it is immediately resolved by a very simple\r\nmethod, known under the name of _reduction to unity_. The result once\r\nobtained, it is indispensable to make the pupils remark that it is\r\ncomposed of the quantity which, among the data, is of the nature of that\r\nwhich is sought, multiplied successively by a series of abstract ratios\r\nbetween other quantities which also, taken two and two, are of the same\r\nnature. Hence flows the rule for writing directly the required result,\r\nwithout being obliged to take up again for each question the series of\r\nreasonings. This has the advantage, not only of saving time, but of\r\nbetter showing the spirit of the method, of making clearer the meaning\r\nof the solution, and of preparing for the subsequent use of formulas.\r\nThe consideration of “homogeneity” conduces to these results.\r\n\r\nWe recommend teachers to abandon as much as possible the use of examples\r\nin abstract numbers, and of insignificant problems, in which the data,\r\ntaken at random, have no connection with reality. Let the examples and\r\nthe exercises presented to students always relate to objects which are\r\nfound in the arts, in industry, in nature, in physics, in the system of\r\nthe world. This will have many advantages. The precise meaning of the\r\nsolutions will be better grasped. The pupils will thus acquire, without\r\nany trouble, a stock of precise and precious knowledge of the world\r\nwhich surrounds them. They will also more willingly engage in numerical\r\ncalculations, when their attention is thus incessantly aroused and\r\nsustained, and when the result, instead of being merely a dry number,\r\nembodies information which is real, useful, and interesting.\r\n\r\nThe former arithmetical programme included the theory of _progressions_\r\nand _logarithms_; the latter being deduced from the former. But the\r\ntheory of logarithms is again deduced in algebra from exponents, much\r\nthe best method. This constitutes an objectionable “_double emploi_.”\r\nThere is finally no good reason for retaining these theories in\r\narithmetic.\r\n\r\nThe programme retains the questions which can be solved by making two\r\narbitrary and successive hypotheses on the desired result. It is true\r\nthat these questions can be directly resolved by means of a simple\r\nequation of the first degree; but we have considered that, since the\r\nresolution of problems by means of hypotheses, constitutes the most\r\nfruitful method really used in practice, it is well to accustom students\r\nto it the soonest possible. This is the more necessary, because teachers\r\nhave generally pursued the opposite course, aiming especially to give\r\ntheir pupils direct solutions, without reflecting that the theory of\r\nthese is usually much more complicated, and that the mind of the learner\r\nthus receives a direction exactly contrary to that which it will have to\r\ntake in the end.\r\n\r\n“Proportions” remain to be noticed.\r\n\r\nIn most arithmetics problems are resolved first by the method of\r\n“reduction to unity,” and then by the theory of proportions. But beside\r\nthe objection of the “_double emploi_,” it is very certain that the\r\nmethod of reduction to unity presents, in their true light and in a\r\ncomplete and simple manner, all the questions of ratio which are the\r\nbases of arithmetical solutions; so that the subsequent introduction of\r\nproportions teaches nothing new to the pupils, and only presents the\r\nsame thing in a more complicated manner. We therefore exclude from our\r\nprogramme of examination the solution of questions of arithmetic,\r\npresented under the special form which constitutes the theory of\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThis special form we would be very careful not to invent, if it had not\r\nalready been employed. Why not say simply “The ratio of M to N is equal\r\nto that of P to Q,” instead of hunting for this other form of\r\nenunciating the same idea, “M _is to_ N _as_ P _is to_ Q”? It is in vain\r\nto allege the necessities of geometry; if we consider all the questions\r\nin which proportions are used, we shall see that the simple\r\nconsideration of the equality of ratios is equally well adapted to the\r\nsimplicity of the enunciation and the clearness of the demonstrations.\r\nHowever, since all the old books of geometry make use of proportions, we\r\nretain the properties of proportions at the end of our programme; but\r\nwith this express reserve, that the examiners shall limit themselves to\r\nthe simple properties which we indicate, and that they shall not demand\r\nany application of proportions to the solution of arithmetical problems.\r\n\r\nPROGRAMME OF ARITHMETIC.\r\n\r\n  Decimal numeration.\r\n\r\n  Addition and subtraction of whole numbers.\r\n\r\n  Multiplication of whole numbers.--Table of Pythagoras.--The product of\r\nseveral whole numbers does not change its value, in whatever order the\r\nmultiplications are effected.--To multiply a number by the product of\r\nseveral factors, it is sufficient to multiply successively by the\r\nfactors of the product.\r\n\r\n  Division of whole numbers.--To divide a number by the product of\r\nseveral factors, it is sufficient to divide successively by the factors\r\nof the product.\r\n\r\n  Remainders from dividing a whole number by 2, 3, 5, 9, and\r\n11.--Applications to the characters of divisibility by one of those\r\nnumbers; to the verification of the product of several factors; and to\r\nthe verification of the quotient of two numbers.\r\n\r\n  Prime numbers.

GEOMETRY\r\n\r\nSome knowledge of Geometry is, next to arithmetic, most indispensable to\r\nevery one, and yet very few possess even its first principles. This is\r\nthe fault of the common system of instruction. We do not pay sufficient\r\nregard to the natural notions about straight lines, angles, parallels,\r\ncircles, etc., which the young have acquired by looking around them, and\r\nwhich their minds have unconsciously considered before making them a\r\nregular study. We thus waste time in giving a dogmatic form to truths\r\nwhich the mind seizes directly.\r\n\r\nThe illustrious _Clairaut_ complains of this, and of the instruction\r\ncommencing always with a great number of definitions, postulates,\r\naxioms, and preliminary principles, dry and repulsive, and followed by\r\npropositions equally uninteresting. He also condemns the profusion of\r\nself-evident propositions, saying, “It is not surprising that Euclid\r\nshould give himself the trouble to demonstrate that two circles which\r\nintersect have not the same centre; that a triangle situated within\r\nanother has the sum of its sides smaller than that of the sides of the\r\ntriangle which contains it; and so on. That geometer had to convince\r\nobstinate sophists, who gloried in denying the most evident truths. It\r\nwas therefore necessary that geometry, like logic, should then have the\r\naid of formal reasonings, to close the mouths of cavillers; but in our\r\nday things have changed face; all reasoning about what mere good sense\r\ndecides in advance is now a pure waste of time, and is fitted, only to\r\nobscure the truth and to disgust the reader.”\r\n\r\n_Bezout_ also condemns the multiplication of the number of theorems,\r\npropositions, and corollaries; an array which makes the student dizzy,\r\nand amid which he is lost. All that follows from a principle should be\r\ngiven in natural language as far as possible, avoiding the dogmatic\r\nform. It is true that some consider the works of Bezout deficient in\r\nrigor, but he knew better than any one what really was a demonstration.\r\nNor do we find in the works of the great old masters less generality of\r\nviews, less precision, less clearness of conception than in modern\r\ntreatises. Quite the contrary indeed.\r\n\r\nWe see this in Bezout’s _definition of a right line_--that it tends\r\ncontinually towards one and the same point; and in that of _a curved\r\nline_--that it is the trace of a moving point, which turns aside\r\ninfinitely little at each step of its progress; definitions most\r\nfruitful in consequences. When we define a right line as the shortest\r\npath from one point to another, we enunciate a property of that line\r\nwhich is of no use for demonstrations. When we define a curved line as\r\none which is neither straight nor composed of straight lines, we\r\nenunciate two negations which can lead to no result, and which have no\r\nconnection with the peculiar nature of the curved line. Bezout’s\r\ndefinition, on the contrary, enters into the nature of the object to be\r\ndefined, seizes its mode of being, its character, and puts the reader\r\nimmediately in possession of the general idea from which are afterwards\r\ndeduced the properties of curved lines and the construction of their\r\ntangents.\r\n\r\nSo too when Bezout says that, in order to form an exact idea of an\r\nangle, it is necessary to consider the movement of a line turning around\r\none of its points, he gives an idea at once more just and more fruitful\r\nin consequences, both mathematical and mechanical, than that which is\r\nlimited to saying, that the indefinite space comprised between two\r\nstraight lines which meet in a point, and which may be regarded as\r\nprolonged indefinitely, is called an _angle_; a definition not very\r\neasily comprehended and absolutely useless for ulterior explanations,\r\nwhile that of Bezout is of continual service.\r\n\r\nWe therefore urge teachers to return, in their demonstrations, to the\r\nsimplest ideas, which are also the most general; to consider a\r\ndemonstration as finished and complete when it has evidently caused the\r\ntruth to enter into the mind of the pupil, and to add nothing merely for\r\nthe sake of silencing sophists.\r\n\r\n   *   *   *\r\n\r\nReferring to our Programme of Geometry, given below, our first comments\r\nrelate to the “Theory of parallels.” This is a subject on which all\r\nstudents fear to be examined; and this being a general feeling, it is\r\nplain that it is not their fault, but that of the manner in which this\r\nsubject is taught. The omission of the natural idea of the constant\r\ndirection of the right line (as defined by Bezout) causes the\r\ncomplication of the first elements; makes it necessary for Legendre to\r\ndemonstrate that all right angles are equal (a proposition whose meaning\r\nis rarely understood); and is the real source of all the pretended\r\ndifficulties of the theory of parallels. These difficulties are now\r\nusually avoided by the admission of a _postulate_, after the example of\r\nEuclid, and to regulate the practice in that matter, we have thought\r\nproper to prescribe that this proposition--_Through a given point only a\r\nsingle parallel to a right line can be drawn_--should be admitted purely\r\nand simply, without demonstration, and as a direct consequence of our\r\nidea of the nature of the right line.\r\n\r\nWe should remark that the order of ideas in our programme supposes the\r\nproperties of lines established without any use of the properties of\r\nsurfaces. We think that, in this respect, it is better to follow Lacroix\r\nthan Legendre.\r\n\r\nWhen we prove thus that three parallels always divide two right lines\r\ninto proportional parts, this proposition can be extended to the case in\r\nwhich the ratio of the parts is incommensurable, either by the method\r\ncalled _Reductio ad absurdum_, or by the method of _Limits_. We\r\nespecially recommend the use of the latter method. The former has in\r\nfact nothing which satisfies the mind, and we should never have recourse\r\nto it, for it is always possible to do without it. When we have proved\r\nto the pupil that a desired quantity, X, cannot be either larger or\r\nsmaller than A, the pupil is indeed forced to admit that X and A are\r\nequal; but that does not make him understand or feel why that equality\r\nexists. Now those demonstrations which are of such a nature that, once\r\ngiven, they disappear, as it were, so as to leave to the proposition\r\ndemonstrated the character of a truth evident _à priori_, are those\r\nwhich should be carefully sought for, not only because they make that\r\ntruth better felt, but because they better prepare the mind for\r\nconceptions of a more elevated order. The method of limits, is, for a\r\ncertain number of questions, the only one which possesses this\r\ncharacteristic--that the demonstration is closely connected with the\r\nessential nature of the proposition to be established.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the relations which exist between the sides of a\r\ntriangle and the segments formed by perpendiculars let fall from the\r\nsummits, we will, once for all, recommend to the teacher, to exercise\r\nhis students in making numerical applications of relations of that kind,\r\nas often as they shall present themselves in the course of geometry.\r\nThis is the way to cause their meaning to be well understood, to fix\r\nthem in the mind of students, and to give these the exercise in\r\nnumerical calculation to which we positively require them to be\r\nhabituated.\r\n\r\nThe theory of similar figures has a direct application in the art of\r\nsurveying for plans (_Lever des plans_). We wish that this application\r\nshould be given to the pupils in detail; that they should be taught to\r\nrange out and measure a straight line on the ground; that a graphometer\r\nshould be placed in their hands; and that they should use it and the\r\nchain to obtain on the ground, for themselves, all the data necessary\r\nfor the construction of a map, which they will present to the examiners\r\nwith the calculations in the margins.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a more complete study of this subject will have to be\r\nsubsequently made by means of trigonometry, in which calculation will\r\ngive more precision than these graphical operations. But some pupils may\r\nfail to extend their studies to trigonometry (the course given for the\r\nPolytechnic school having become the model for general instruction in\r\nFrance), and those who do will thus learn that trigonometry merely gives\r\nmeans of more precise calculation. This application will also be an\r\nencouragement to the study of a science whose utility the pupil will\r\nthus begin to comprehend.\r\n\r\nIt is common to say that an angle is measured by the arc of a circle,\r\ndescribed from its summit or centre, and intercepted between its sides.\r\nIt is true that teachers add, that since a quantity cannot be measured\r\nexcept by one of the same nature, and since the arc of a circle is of a\r\ndifferent nature from an angle, the preceding enunciation is only an\r\nabridgment of the proposition by which we find the ratio of an angle to\r\na right angle. Despite this precaution, the unqualified enunciation\r\nwhich precedes, causes uncertainty in the mind of the pupil, and\r\nproduces in it a lamentable confusion. We will say as much of the\r\nfollowing enunciations: “A dihedral angle is measured by the plane angle\r\nincluded between its sides;” “The surface of a spherical triangle is\r\nmeasured by the excess of the sum of its three angles above two right\r\nangles,” etc.; enunciations which have no meaning in themselves, and\r\nfrom which every trace of homogeneity has disappeared. Now that\r\neverybody is requiring that the students of the Polytechnic school\r\nshould better understand the meaning of the formulas which they are\r\ntaught, which requires that their homogeneity should always be apparent,\r\nthis should be attended to from the beginning of their studies, in\r\ngeometry as well as in arithmetic. The examiners must therefore insist\r\nthat the pupils shall never give them any enunciations in which\r\nhomogeneity is not preserved.\r\n\r\nThe proportionality of the circumferences of circles to their radii must\r\nbe inferred _directly_ from the proportionality of the perimeters of\r\nregular polygons, of the same number of sides, to their apothems. In\r\nlike manner, from the area of a regular polygon being measured by half\r\nof the product of its perimeter by the radius of the inscribed circle,\r\nit must be _directly_ inferred that the area of a circle is measured by\r\nhalf of the product of its circumference by its radius. For a long time,\r\nthese properties of the circle were differently demonstrated by proving,\r\nfor example, with Legendre, that the measure of the circle could not be\r\neither smaller or greater than that which we have just given, whence it\r\nhad to be inferred that it must be equal to it. The “Council of\r\nimprovement” finally decided that this method should be abandoned, and\r\nthat the method of limits should alone be admitted, in the examinations,\r\nfor demonstrations of this kind. This was a true advance, but it was not\r\nsufficient. It did not, as it should, go on to consider the circle,\r\npurely and simply, as the limit of a series of regular polygons, the\r\nnumber of whose sides goes on increasing to infinity, and to regard the\r\ncircle as possessing every property demonstrated for polygons. Instead\r\nof this, they inscribed and circumscribed to the circle two polygons of\r\nthe same number of sides, and proved that, by the multiplication of the\r\nnumber of the sides of these polygons, the difference of their areas\r\nmight become smaller than any given quantity, and thence, finally,\r\ndeduced the measure of the area of the circle; that is to say, they took\r\naway from the method of limits all its advantage as to simplicity, by\r\nnot applying it _frankly_.\r\n\r\nWe now ask that this shall cease; and that we shall no longer reproach\r\nfor want of rigor, the Lagranges, the Laplaces, the Poissons, and\r\nLeibnitz, who has given us this principle: that “A curvilinear figure\r\nmay be regarded as equivalent to a polygon of an infinite number of\r\nsides; whence it follows that whatsoever can be demonstrated of such a\r\npolygon, no regard being paid to the number of its sides, the same may\r\nbe asserted of the curve.” This is the principle for _the most simple_\r\napplication of which to the measure of the circle and of the round\r\nbodies we appeal.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the formulas which may be given to the pupils for the\r\ndetermination of the ratio of the circumference to the diameter (the\r\n“Method of isoperimeters” is to be recommended for its simplicity), they\r\nmust be required to perform the calculation, so as to obtain at least\r\ntwo or three exact decimals. These calculations, made with logarithms,\r\nmust be methodically arranged and presented at the examination. It may\r\nbe known whether the candidate is really the author of the papers, by\r\ncalling for explanations on some of the steps, or making him calculate\r\nsome points afresh.\r\n\r\nThe enunciations relating to the measurement of areas too often leave\r\nindistinctness in the minds of students, doubtless because of their\r\nform. We desire to make them better comprehended, by insisting on their\r\napplication by means of a great number of examples.\r\n\r\nAs one application, we require the knowledge of the methods of surveying\r\nfor content (_arpentage_), differing somewhat from the method of\r\ntriangulation, used in the surveying for plans (_lever des plans_). To\r\nmake this application more fruitful, the ground should be bounded on one\r\nside by an irregular curve. The pupils will not only thus learn how to\r\novercome this practical difficulty, but they will find, in the\r\ncalculation of the surface by means of trapezoids, the first application\r\nof the method of quadratures, with which it is important that they\r\nshould very early become familiar. This application will constitute a\r\nnew sheet of drawing and calculations to be presented at the\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nMost of our remarks on plane geometry apply to geometry of three\r\ndimensions. Care should be taken always to leave homogeneity apparent\r\nand to make numerous applications to the measurement of volumes.\r\n\r\nThe theory of similar polyhedrons often gives rise in the examination of\r\nthe students to serious difficulties on their part. These difficulties\r\nbelong rather to the form than to the substance, and to the manner in\r\nwhich each individual mind seizes relations of position; relations\r\nalways easier to feel than to express. The examiners should be content\r\nwith arriving at the results enunciated in our programme, by the\r\nshortest and easiest road.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity desired cannot however be attained unless all have a\r\ncommon starting-point, in the definition of similar polyhedrons. The\r\nbest course is assuredly to consider that theory in the point of view in\r\nwhich it is employed in the arts, especially in sculpture; i.e. to\r\nconceive the given system of points, M, N, P, . . . . to have lines\r\npassing from them through a point S, the _pole of similitude_, and\r\nprolonged beyond it to M’, N’, P’, . . . . so that SM’, SN’, SP’,\r\n. . . . are proportional to SM, SN, SP, . . . . . Then the points M’,\r\nN’, P’, . . . . form a system _similar_ to M, N, P, . . . . .\r\n\r\nThe areas and volumes of the cylinder, of the cone, and of the sphere\r\nmust be deduced from the areas and from the volumes of the prism, of the\r\npyramid, and of the polygonal sector, with the same simplicity which we\r\nhave required for the measure of the surface of the circle, and for the\r\nsame reasons. It is, besides, the only means of easily extending to\r\ncones and cylinders with any bases whatever, right or oblique, those\r\nproperties of cones and cylinders,--right and with circular\r\nbases,--which are applicable to them.\r\n\r\nNumerical examples of the calculations, by logarithms, of these areas\r\nand volumes, including the area of a spherical triangle, will make\r\nanother sheet to be presented to the examiners.\r\n\r\n  PROGRAMME OF GEOMETRY.\r\n\r\n  1.

The calculations will be made by\r\n    logarithms.]\r\n\r\nIII. ALGEBRA.\r\n\r\nAlgebra[4] is not, as are Arithmetic and Geometry, indispensable to\r\nevery one. It should be very sparingly introduced into the general\r\neducation of youth, and we would there willingly dispense with it\r\nentirely, excepting logarithms, if this would benefit the study of\r\narithmetic and geometry. The programme of it which we are now to give,\r\nconsiders it purely in view of its utility to engineers, and we will\r\ncarefully eliminate every thing not necessary for them.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: The true distinction between ALGEBRA and ARITHMETIC\r\n    is so commonly overlooked that it maybe well to present it here,\r\n    in the words of Comte. “The complete solution of every question of\r\n    calculation is necessarily composed of two successive parts, which\r\n    have essentially distinct natures. In the first, the object is to\r\n    _transform_ the proposed equations, so as to make apparent the\r\n    manner in which the unknown quantities are formed by the known\r\n    ones; it is this which constitutes the _Algebraic_ question. In\r\n    the second, our object is _to find the value_ of the formulas thus\r\n    obtained; that is, to determine directly the values of the numbers\r\n    sought, which are already represented by certain explicit\r\n    functions of given numbers; this is the _Arithmetical_ question.\r\n    Thus the stopping-point of the algebraic part of the solution\r\n    becomes the starting-point of the arithmetical part.\r\n\r\n    “ALGEBRA may therefore be defined as having for its object the\r\n    _resolution of equations_; taking this expression in its full\r\n    logical meaning, which signifies the transformation of _implicit_\r\n    functions into equivalent _explicit_ ones. In the same way\r\n    ARITHMETIC may be defined as intended for _the determination of\r\n    the values of functions_. Henceforth, therefore, we may call\r\n    ALGEBRA _the Calculus of Functions_, and ARITHMETIC _the Calculus\r\n    of Values_.”]\r\n\r\nAlgebraical calculation presents no serious difficulty, when its\r\nstudents become well impressed with this idea, that every letter\r\nrepresents a number; and particularly when the consideration of negative\r\nquantities is not brought in at the outset and in an absolute manner.\r\nThese quantities and their properties should not be introduced except as\r\nthe solution of questions by means of equations causes their necessity\r\nto be felt, either for generalizing the rules of calculation, or for\r\nextending the meaning of the formulas to which it leads. CLAIRAUT\r\npursues this course. He says, “I treat of the multiplication of negative\r\nquantities, that dangerous shoal for both scholars and teachers, only\r\nafter having shown its necessity to the learner, by giving him a problem\r\nin which he has to consider negative quantities independently of any\r\npositive quantities from which they are subtracted. When I have arrived\r\nat that point in the problem where I have to multiply or divide negative\r\nquantities by one another, I take the course which was undoubtedly taken\r\nby the first analysts who have had those operations to perform and who\r\nhave wished to follow a perfectly sure route: I seek for a solution of\r\nthe problem which does not involve these operations; I thus arrive at\r\nthe result by reasonings which admit of no doubt, and I thus see what\r\nthose products or quotients of negative quantities, which had given me\r\nthe first solution, must be.” BEZOUT proceeds in the same way.\r\n\r\nWe recommend to teachers to follow these examples; not to speak to their\r\npupils about negative quantities till the necessity of it is felt, and\r\nwhen they have become familiar with algebraic calculation; and above all\r\nnot to lose precious time in obscure discussions and demonstrations,\r\nwhich the best theory will never teach students so well as numerous\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to take up again, in algebra, the calculus of\r\nfractions, so as to generalize the explanations given in arithmetic,\r\nsince the terms of literal fractions may be any quantities whatsoever.\r\nRigorously, this may be well, but to save time we omit this, thinking it\r\nbetter to employ this time in advancing and exercising the mind on new\r\ntruths, rather than in returning continually to rules already given, in\r\norder to imprint a new degree of rigor on their demonstration, or to\r\ngive them an extension of which no one doubts.\r\n\r\nThe study of numerical equations of the first degree, with one or\r\nseveral unknown quantities, must be made with great care. We have\r\nrequired the solution of these equations to be made by the method of\r\n_substitution_. We have done this, not only because this method really\r\ncomprehends the others, particularly that of _comparison_, but for this\r\nfarther reason. In treatises on algebra, those equations alone are\r\nconsidered whose numerical coefficients and solutions are very simple\r\nnumbers. It then makes very little difference what method is used, or in\r\nwhat order the unknown quantities are eliminated. But it is a very\r\ndifferent thing in practice, where the coefficients are complicated\r\nnumbers, given with decimal parts, and where the numerical values of\r\nthese coefficients may be very different in the same equation, some\r\nbeing very great and some very small. In such cases the method of\r\n_substitution_ can alone be employed to advantage, and that with the\r\nprecaution of taking the value of the unknown quantity to be eliminated\r\nfrom that equation in which it has relatively the greatest, coefficient.\r\nNow the method of _comparison_ is only the method of substitution put in\r\na form in which these precautions cannot be observed, so that in\r\npractice it will give bad results with much labor.\r\n\r\nThe candidates must present to the examiners the complete calculations\r\nof the resolution of four equations with four unknown quantities, made\r\nwith all the precision permitted by the logarithmic tables of Callet,\r\nand the proof that that precision has been obtained. The coefficients\r\nmust contain decimals and be very different from one another, and the\r\nelimination must be effected with the above precautions.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of the present day disregards too much the applicability of\r\nthe methods given, provided only that they be elegant in their form; so\r\nthat they have to be abandoned and changed when the pupils enter on\r\npractice. This disdain of practical utility was not felt by our great\r\nmathematicians, who incessantly turned their attention towards\r\napplications. Thus the illustrious Lagrange made suggestions like those\r\njust given; and Laplace recommended the drawing of curves for solving\r\ndirectly all kinds of numerical equations.\r\n\r\nAs to literal equations of the first degree, we call for formulas\r\nsufficient for the resolution of equations of two or three unknown\r\nquantities. Bezout’s method of elimination must be given as a first\r\napplication of that fruitful method of indeterminates. The general\r\ndiscussion of formulas will be confined to the case of two unknown\r\nquantities. The discussion of three equations with three unknown\r\nquantities, _x_, _y_, and _z_, in which the terms independent of the\r\nunknown quantities are null, will be made directly, by this simple\r\nconsideration that the system then really includes only two unknown\r\nquantities, to wit, the ratios of _x_ and _y_, for example, to _z_.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of inequalities of the first degree with one or more\r\nunknown quantities, was added to equations of the first degree some\r\nyears ago. We do not retain that addition.\r\n\r\nThe equations of the second degree, like the first, must be very\r\ncarefully given. In dwelling on the case where the coefficient of\r\n_x_^{2} converges towards zero, it will be remarked that, when the\r\ncoefficient is very small, the ordinary formula would give one of the\r\nroots by the difference of two numbers almost equal; so that sufficient\r\nexactness could not be obtained without much labor. It must be shown how\r\nthat inconvenience may be avoided.\r\n\r\nIt is common to meet with expressions of which the maximum or the\r\nminimum can be determined by the consideration of an equation of the\r\nsecond degree. We retain the study of them, especially for the benefit\r\nof those who will not have the opportunity of advancing to the general\r\ntheory of maxima and minima.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the algebraic calculation of imaginary quantities, given\r\n_à priori_, may, on the contrary, be set aside without inconvenience.\r\nIt is enough that the pupils know that the different powers of √-1\r\ncontinually reproduce in turn one of these four values, ±1, ±√-1. We\r\nwill say as much of the calculation of the algebraic values of radicals,\r\nwhich is of no use. The calculation of their _arithmetical_ values will\r\nalone be demanded. In this connection will be taught the notation of\r\nfractional exponents and that of negative exponents.\r\n\r\nThe theory of numbers has taken by degrees a disproportionate\r\ndevelopment in the examinations for admission; it is of no use in\r\npractice, and, besides, constitutes in the pure mathematics a science\r\napart.\r\n\r\nThe theory of continued fractions at first seems more useful. It is\r\nemployed in the resolution of algebraic equations, and in that of the\r\nexponential equation _a_^{_x_}=_b_. But these methods are entirely\r\nunsuited to practice, and we therefore omit this theory.\r\n\r\nThe theory of series, on the contrary, claims some farther developments.\r\nSeries are continually met with in practice; they give the best\r\nsolutions of many questions, and it is indispensable to know in what\r\ncircumstances they can be safely employed.\r\n\r\nWe have so often insisted on the necessity of teaching students to\r\ncalculate, as to justify the extent of the part of the programme\r\nrelating to logarithms. We have suppressed the inapplicable method of\r\ndetermining logarithms by continued fractions, and have substituted the\r\nemployment of the series which gives the logarithm of _n_+1, knowing\r\nthat of _n_. To exercise the students in the calculation of the series,\r\nthey should be made to determine the logarithms of the numbers from 1 to\r\n10, from 101 to 110, and from 10,000 to 10,010, the object of these last\r\nbeing to show them with what rapidity the calculation proceeds when the\r\nnumbers are large; the first term of the series is then sufficient, the\r\nvariations of the logarithms being sensibly proportional to the\r\nvariations of the numbers, within the limits of the necessary exactness.\r\nIn the logarithmic calculations, the pupils will be exercised in judging\r\nof the exactness which they may have been able to obtain: the\r\nconsideration of the numerical values of the proportional parts given in\r\nthe tables is quite sufficient for this purpose, and is beside the only\r\none which can be employed in practice.\r\n\r\nThe use of the sliding rule, which is merely an application of\r\nlogarithms, gives a rapid and portable means of executing approximately\r\na great number of calculations which do not require great exactness. We\r\ndesire that the use of this little instrument should be made familiar to\r\nthe candidates. This is asked for by all the professors of the “School\r\nof application,” particularly those of Topography, of Artillery, of\r\nConstruction, and of Applied Mechanics, who have been convinced by\r\nexperience of the utility of this instrument, which has the greatest\r\npossible analogy with tables of logarithms.\r\n\r\nBefore entering on the subjects of higher algebra, it should be\r\nremembered that the reductions of the course which we have found to be\r\nso urgent, will be made chiefly on it. The general theory of equations\r\nhas taken in the examinations an abnormal and improper development, not\r\nworth the time which it costs the students. We may add, that it is very\r\nrare to meet a numerical equation of a high degree requiring to be\r\nresolved, and that those who have to do this, take care not to seek its\r\nroots by the methods which they have been taught. These methods moreover\r\nare not applicable to transcendental equations, which are much more\r\nfrequently found in practice.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the greatest common algebraic divisor, in its entire\r\ngenerality, is of no use, even in pure science, unless in the\r\nelimination between equations of any degree whatever. But this last\r\nsubject being omitted, the greatest common divisor is likewise dispensed\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nIt is usual in the general theory of algebraic equations to consider the\r\nderived polynomials of entire functions of _x_. These polynomials are in\r\nfact useful in several circumstances, and particularly in the theory of\r\nequal roots; and in analytical geometry, they serve for the discussion\r\nof curves and the determination of their tangents. But since\r\ntranscendental curves are very often encountered in practice, we give in\r\nour programme the calculation of the derivatives of algebraic and\r\nfractional functions, and transcendental functions, logarithmic,\r\nexponential, and circular. This has been long called for, not only\r\nbecause it must be of great assistance in the teaching of analytical\r\ngeometry, but also because it will facilitate the elementary study of\r\nthe infinitesimal calculus.\r\n\r\nWe have not retrenched any of the general ideas on the composition of an\r\nentire polynomial by means of factors corresponding to its roots. We\r\nretain several theorems rather because they contain the germs of useful\r\nideas than because of their practical utility, and therefore wish the\r\nexaminers to restrict themselves scrupulously to the programme.\r\n\r\nThe essential point in practice is to be able to determine conveniently\r\nan incommensurable root of an algebraic or transcendental equation, when\r\nencountered. Let us consider first an algebraic equation.\r\n\r\nAll the methods which have for their object to separate the roots, or to\r\napproximate to them, begin with the substitution of the series of\r\nconsecutive whole numbers, in the first member of the equation. The\r\ndirect substitution becomes exceedingly complicated, when the numbers\r\nsubstituted become large. It may be much shortened, however, by deducing\r\nthe results from one another by means of their differences, and guarding\r\nagainst any possibility of error, by verifying some of those results,\r\nthose corresponding to the numbers easiest to substitute, such as ±10,\r\n±20. The teacher should not fail to explain this to his pupils.\r\n\r\nStill farther: let us suppose that we have to resolve an equation of the\r\nthird degree, and that we have recognized by the preceding calculations\r\nthe necessity of substituting, between the numbers 2 and 3, numbers\r\ndiffering by a tenth, either for the purpose of continuing to effect the\r\nseparation of the roots, or to approximate nearer to a root comprised\r\nbetween 2 and 3. If we knew, for the result corresponding to the\r\nsubstitution of 2, the first, second, and third differences of the\r\nresults of the new substitutions, we could thence deduce those results\r\nthemselves with as much simplicity, as in the case of the whole numbers.\r\nThe new third difference, for example, will be simply the thousandth\r\npart of the old third difference. We may also remark that there is no\r\npossibility of error, since, the numbers being deduced from one another,\r\nwhen we in this way arrive at the result of the substitution of 3, which\r\nhas already been calculated, the whole work will thus be verified.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose again that we have thus recognized that the equation has\r\na root comprised between 2.3 and 2.4; we will approximate still nearer\r\nby substituting intermediate numbers, differing by 0.01, and employing\r\nthe course just prescribed. As soon as the third differences can be\r\nneglected, the calculation will be finished at once, by the\r\nconsideration of an equation of the second degree; or, if it is\r\npreferred to continue the approximations till the second differences in\r\ntheir turn may be neglected, the calculation will then be finished by a\r\nsimple proportion.\r\n\r\nWhen, in a transcendental equation _f_(X) = 0, we have substituted in\r\n_f_(X) equidistant numbers, sufficiently near to each other to allow the\r\ndifferences of the results to be neglected, commencing with a certain\r\norder, the 4th, for example, we may, within certain limits of _x_,\r\nreplace the transcendental function by an algebraic and entire function\r\nof _x_, and thus reduce the search for the roots of _f_(X) = 0 to the\r\npreceding theory.\r\n\r\nWhether the proposed equation be algebraic or transcendental, we can\r\nthus, when we have obtained one root of it with a suitable degree of\r\nexactness, continue the approximation by the method of Newton.\r\n\r\n  PROGRAMME OF ALGEBRA.\r\n\r\n  _Algebraic calculation._\r\n\r\n  Addition and subtraction of polynomials.--Reduction of similar terms.\r\n\r\n  Multiplication of monomials.--Use of exponents.--Multiplication of\r\npolynomials.

TRIGONOMETRY.\r\n\r\nIn explaining the use of trigonometrical tables, the pupil must be able\r\nto tell with what degree of exactness an angle can be determined by the\r\nlogarithms of any of its trigonometrical lines. The consideration of the\r\nproportional parts will be sufficient for this. It will thus be seen\r\nthat if the _sine_ determines perfectly a small angle, the degree of\r\nexactness, which may be expected from the use of that line, diminishes\r\nas the angle increases, and becomes quite insufficient in the\r\nneighborhood of 90 degrees. It is the reverse for the _cosine_, which\r\nmay serve very well to represent an angle near 90 degrees, while it\r\nwould be very inexact for small angles. We see, then, that in our\r\napplications, we should distrust those formulas which give an angle by\r\nits sine or cosine. The _tangent_ being alone exempt from these\r\ndifficulties, we should seek, as far as possible, to resolve all\r\nquestions by means of it. Thus, let us suppose that we know the\r\nhypothenuse and one of the sides of a right-angled triangle, the direct\r\ndetermination of the included angle will be given by a cosine, which\r\nwill be wanting in exactness if the hypothenuse of the triangle does not\r\ndiffer much from the given side. In that case we should begin by\r\ncalculating the third side, and then use it with the first side to\r\ndetermine the desired angle by means of its tangent. When two sides of a\r\ntriangle and the included angle are given, the tangent of the half\r\ndifference of the desired angles may be calculated with advantage; but\r\nwe may also separately determine the tangent of each of them. When the\r\nthree sides of a triangle are given, the best formula for calculating an\r\nangle, and the only one never at fault, is that which gives the tangent\r\nof half of it.\r\n\r\nThe surveying for plans, taught in the course of Geometry, employing\r\nonly graphical methods of calculation, did not need any more accurate\r\ninstruments than the chain and the graphometer; but now that\r\ntrigonometry furnishes more accurate methods of calculation, the\r\nmeasurements on the ground require more precision. Hence the requirement\r\nfor the pupil to measure carefully a base, to use telescopes, verniers,\r\netc., and to make the necessary calculations, the ground being still\r\nconsidered as plane. But as these slow and laborious methods can be\r\nemployed for only the principal points of the survey, the more\r\nexpeditious means of the plane-table and compass will be used for the\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nIn spherical trigonometry, all that will be needed in geodesy should be\r\nlearned before admission to the school, so that the subject will not\r\nneed to be again taken up. We have specially inscribed in the programme\r\nthe relations between the angles and sides of a right-angled triangle,\r\nwhich must be known by the students; they are those which occur in\r\npractice. In tracing the course to be pursued in the resolution of the\r\nthree cases of any triangles, we have indicated that which is in fact\r\nemployed in the applications, and which is the most convenient. As to\r\nthe rest, ambiguous cases never occur in practice, and therefore we\r\nshould take care not to speak of them to learners.\r\n\r\nIn surveying, spherical trigonometry will now allow us to consider cases\r\nin which the signals are not all in the same plane, and to operate on\r\nuneven ground, obtain its projection on the plane of the horizon, and at\r\nthe same time determine differences of level.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked that Descriptive Geometry might supply the place of\r\nspherical trigonometry by a graphical construction, but the degree of\r\nexactitude of the differences of level thus obtained would be\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\n  PROGRAMME OF TRIGONOMETRY.\r\n\r\n  1.

ANALYTICAL GEOMETRY.\r\n\r\nThe important property of homogeneity must be given with clearness and\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of co-ordinates must receive some numerical\r\napplications, which are indispensable to make the student clearly see\r\nthe meaning of the formulas.\r\n\r\nThe determination of tangents will be effected in the most general\r\nmanner by means of the derivatives of the various functions, which we\r\ninserted in the programme of algebra. After having shown that this\r\ndetermination depends on the calculation of the derivative of the\r\nordinate with respect to the abscissa, this will be used to simplify the\r\ninvestigation of the tangent to curves of the second degree and to\r\ncurves whose equations contain transcendental functions. The discussion\r\nof these, formerly pursued by laborious indirect methods, will now\r\nbecome easy; and as curves with transcendental equations are frequently\r\nencountered, it will be well to exercise students in their discussion.\r\n\r\nThe properties of foci and of the directrices of curves of the second\r\ndegree will be established directly, for each of the three curves, by\r\nmeans of the simplest equations of these curves, and without any\r\nconsideration of the analytical properties of foci, with respect to the\r\ngeneral equation of the second degree. With even greater reason will we\r\ndispense with examining whether curves of higher degree have foci, a\r\nquestion whose meaning even is not well defined.\r\n\r\nWe retained in algebra the elimination between two equations of the\r\nsecond degree with two unknown quantities, a problem which corresponds\r\nto the purely analytical investigation of the co-ordinates of the points\r\nof intersection of two curves of the second degree. The final equation\r\nis in general of the fourth degree, but we may sometimes dispense with\r\ncalculating that equation. A graphical construction of the curves,\r\ncarefully made, will in fact be sufficient to make known, approximately,\r\nthe co-ordinates of each of the points of intersection; and when we\r\nshall have thus obtained an approximate solution, we will often be able\r\nto give it all the numerical rigor desirable, by successive\r\napproximations, deduced from the equations. These considerations will be\r\nextended to the investigation of the real roots of equations of any form\r\nwhatever with one unknown quantity.\r\n\r\nAnalytical geometry of three dimensions was formerly entirely taught\r\nwithin the Polytechnic school, none of it being reserved for the course\r\nof admission. For some years past, however, candidates were required to\r\nknow the equations of the right line in space, the equation of the\r\nplane, the solution of the problems which relate to it and the\r\ntransformation of co-ordinates. But the consideration of surfaces of the\r\nsecond order was reserved for the interior teaching. We think it well to\r\nplace this also among the studies to be mastered before admission, in\r\naccordance with the general principle now sought to be realized, of\r\nclassing with them that double instruction which does not exact a\r\nprevious knowledge of the differential calculus.\r\n\r\nWe have not, however, inserted here all the properties of surfaces of\r\nthe second order, but have retained only those which it is indispensable\r\nto know and to retain. The transformation of rectilinear co-ordinates,\r\nfor example, must be executed with simplicity, and the teacher must\r\nrestrict himself to giving his pupils a succinct explanation of the\r\ncourse to be pursued; this will suffice to them for the very rare cases\r\nin which they may happen to have need of them. No questions will be\r\nasked relating to the general considerations, which require very\r\ncomplicated theoretical discussions, and especially that of the general\r\nreduction of the equation of the second degree with three variables. We\r\nhave omitted from the problems relating to the right line and to the\r\nplane, the determination of the shortest distance of two right lines.\r\n\r\nThe properties of surfaces of the second order will be deduced from the\r\nequations of those surfaces, taken directly in the simplest forms. Among\r\nthese properties, we place in the first rank, for their valuable\r\napplications, those of the surfaces which can be generated by the\r\nmovement of a right line.\r\n\r\n  PROGRAMME OF ANALYTICAL GEOMETRY.\r\n\r\n  1.

Reciprocally, every surface resulting\r\nfrom one of these two modes of generation is a hyperbolic paraboloid.\r\n\r\n  General equations of conical surfaces and of cylindrical surfaces.\r\n\r\nVI. DESCRIPTIVE GEOMETRY.\r\n\r\nThe general methods of Descriptive Geometry,--their uses in\r\nStone-cutting and Carpentry, in Linear Perspective, and in the\r\ndetermination of the Shadows of bodies,--constitute one of the most\r\nfruitful branches of the applications of mathematics. The course has\r\nalways been given at the Polytechnic School with particular care,\r\naccording to the plans traced by the illustrious _Monge_, but no part of\r\nthe subject has heretofore been required for admission. The time given\r\nto it in the school, being however complained of on all sides as\r\ninsufficient for its great extent and important applications, the\r\ngeneral methods of Descriptive Geometry will henceforth be retrenched\r\nfrom the internal course, and be required of all candidates for\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\nAs to the programme itself, it is needless to say any thing, for it was\r\nestablished by _Monge_, and the extent which he gave to it, as well as\r\nthe methods which he had created, have thus far been maintained. We\r\nmerely suppress the construction of the shortest distance between two\r\nright-lines, which presents a disagreeable and useless complication.\r\n\r\nCandidates will have to present to the examiner a collection of their\r\ngraphical constructions (_épures_) of all the questions of the\r\nprogramme, signed by their teacher. They are farther required to make\r\nfree-hand sketches of five of their _épures_.\r\n\r\n    PROGRAMME OF DESCRIPTIVE GEOMETRY.\r\n\r\n    _Problems relating to the point, to the straight line, and to the\r\nplane._[7]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: The method of the change of the planes of projection\r\n    will be used for the resolution of these problems.]\r\n\r\n    Through a point given in space, to pass a right line parallel to a\r\ngiven right line, and to find the length of a part of that right line.\r\n\r\n    Through a given point, to pass a plane parallel to a given plane.\r\n\r\n    To construct the plane which passes through three points given in\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n    Two planes being given, to find the projections of their\r\nintersection.\r\n\r\n    A right line and a plane being given, to find the projections of the\r\npoint in which the right line meets the plane.\r\n\r\n    Through a given point, to pass a perpendicular to a given plane, and\r\nto construct the projections of the point of meeting of the right line\r\nand of the plane.\r\n\r\n    Through a given point, to pass a right line perpendicular to a given\r\nright line, and to construct the projections of the point of meeting of\r\nthe two right lines.\r\n\r\n    A plane being given, to find the angles which it forms with the\r\nplanes of projection.\r\n\r\n    Two planes being given, to construct the angle which they form\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n    Two right lines which cut each other being given, to construct the\r\nangle which they form between them.\r\n\r\n    To construct the angle formed by a right line and by a plane given\r\nin position in space.\r\n\r\n    _Problems relating to tangent planes._\r\n\r\n    To draw a plane tangent to a cylindrical surface or to a conical\r\nsurface, 1º through a point taken on the surface; 2º through a point\r\ntaken out of the surface; 3º parallel to a given right line.\r\n\r\n    Through a point taken on a surface of revolution, whose meridian is\r\nknown, to pass a plane tangent to that surface.\r\n\r\n  _Problems relating to the intersection of surfaces._\r\n\r\n  To construct the section made, on the surface of a right and vertical\r\ncylinder, by a plane perpendicular to one of the planes of\r\nprojection.--To draw the tangent to the curve of intersection.--To make\r\nthe development of the cylindrical surface, and to refer to it the curve\r\nof intersection, and also the tangent.\r\n\r\n  To construct the intersection of a right cone by a plane perpendicular\r\nto one of the planes of projection.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe preceding six heads complete the outline of the elementary course of\r\nmathematical instruction which it was the object of this article to\r\npresent; but a few more lines may well be given to a mere enumeration of\r\nthe other requirements for admission to the school.\r\n\r\nMECHANICS comes next. The programme is arranged under these heads:\r\nSimple motion and compound motion; Inertia; Forces applied to a free\r\nmaterial point; Work of forces applied to a movable point; Forces\r\napplied to a solid body; Machines.\r\n\r\nPHYSICS comprises these topics: General properties of bodies;\r\nHydrostatics and hydraulics; Densities of solids and liquids; Properties\r\nof gases; Heat; Steam; Electricity; Magnetism; Acoustics; Light.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY treats of Oxygen; Hydrogen; Combinations of hydrogen with\r\noxygen; Azote or nitrogen; Combinations of azote with oxygen;\r\nCombination of azote with hydrogen, or ammonia; Sulphur; Chlorine;\r\nPhosphorus; Carbon.\r\n\r\nCOSMOGRAPHY describes the Stars; the Earth; the Sun; the Moon; the\r\nPlanets; Comets; the Tides.\r\n\r\nHISTORY and GEOGRAPHY treat of Europe from the Roman Empire to the\r\naccession of Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nGERMAN must be known sufficiently for it to be translated, spoken a\r\nlittle, and written in its own characters.\r\n\r\nDRAWING, besides the _épures_ of descriptive geometry, must have been\r\nacquired sufficiently for copying an academic study, and shading in\r\npencil and in India ink.\r\n\r\nWill not our readers agree with M. Coriolis, that “_There are very few\r\nlearned mathematicians who could answer perfectly well at an examination\r\nfor admission to the Polytechnic School_”?\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS OF PREPARATION FOR THE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL\r\n\r\nThere are strictly speaking no Junior Military Schools preparatory to\r\nthe Polytechnic School, or to the Special Military School at St. Cyr.\r\nThese schools are recruited in general from the _Lycées_ and other\r\nschools for secondary instruction, upon which they exert a most powerful\r\ninfluence. Until 1852 there was no special provision made in the courses\r\nof instruction in the _Lycées_ for the mathematical preparation required\r\nfor admission into the Polytechnic, and the Bachelor’s degree in science\r\ncould not be obtained without being able to meet the requirements in\r\nLatin, rhetoric, and logic for graduation in the arts, which was\r\nnecessary to the profession of law, medicine, and theology. In\r\nconsequence, young men who prepared to be candidates for the preliminary\r\nexaminations at the Polytechnic and the St. Cyr, left the _Lycées_\r\nbefore graduation in order to acquire more geometry and less literature\r\nin the private schools, or under private tuition.\r\n\r\nA new arrangement, popularly called the _Bifurcation_, was introduced by\r\nthe Decrees of the 10th of April, 1852; and has now come into operation.\r\nThe conditions demanded for the degree in science were adapted to the\r\nrequirements of the Military Schools; and in return for this concession\r\nit is henceforth to be exacted from candidates for the Military Schools.\r\nThe diploma of arts is no longer required before the diploma of science\r\ncan be given. The instruction, which in the upper classes of the\r\n_Lycées_ had hitherto been mainly preparatory for the former, takes\r\nhenceforth at a certain point (called that of _Bifurcation_) two\r\ndifferent routes, conducting separately, the one to the baccalaureate of\r\narts, the other to that of science. The whole system of teaching has\r\naccordingly been altered. Boys wanting to study algebra are no longer\r\ncarried through a long course of Latin; mathematics are raised to an\r\nequality with literature; and thus military pupils--pupils desirous of\r\nadmission at the Polytechnic and St. Cyr, may henceforth, it is hoped,\r\nobtain in the _Lycées_ all the preparation which they had latterly\r\nsought elsewhere.\r\n\r\nUnder this new system the usual course for a boy seems to be the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\nHe enters the _Lycée_, in the Elementary Classes; or, a little later, in\r\nthe Grammar Classes, where he learns Latin and begins Greek. At the age\r\nof about fourteen, he is called upon to pass an examination for\r\nadmission into the Upper Division, and here, in accordance with the new\r\nregulations, he makes his choice for mathematics or for literature, the\r\nstudies henceforth being divided, one course leading to the bachelorship\r\nof science, the other to that of arts.\r\n\r\nIn either case he has before him three yearly courses, three\r\nclasses--the Third, the Second, and what is called the Rhetoric. At the\r\nclose of this, or after passing, if he pleases, another year in what is\r\ncalled the Logic, he may go up for his bachelor’s degree. The boy who\r\nwants to go to St. Cyr or the Polytechnic chooses, of course, the\r\nmathematical division leading to the diploma he will want, that of a\r\nbachelor of _science_. He accordingly begins algebra, goes on to\r\ntrigonometry, to conic sections, and to mechanics, and through\r\ncorresponding stages in natural philosophy, and the like. If he chooses\r\nto spend a fourth year in the Logic, he will be chiefly employed in\r\ngoing over his subjects again. He may take his bachelor’s degree at any\r\ntime after finishing his third year; and he may, if he pleases, having\r\ntaken that, remain during a fifth or even a sixth year, in the class of\r\nSpecial Mathematics.\r\n\r\nIf he be intended for St. Cyr, he may very well leave at the end of his\r\nyear in Rhetoric, taking of course his degree. One year in the course of\r\nSpecial Mathematics will be required before he can have a chance for the\r\nPolytechnic. Usually the number of students admitted at the latter, who\r\nhave not passed more than one year in the _mathematiques spéciales_ is\r\nvery small. Very probably the young aspirant would try at the end of his\r\nfirst year in this class, and would learn by practice to do better at\r\nthe end of the second.\r\n\r\nThe following are the studies of the mathematical section of the upper\r\ndivision as laid down by the ordinance of 30th August, 1854.\r\n\r\n  THE THIRD CLASS (_Troisième_,) at fourteen years old.\r\n\r\n  Arithmetic and first notions of Algebra. Plane Geometry and its\r\napplications. First notions of Chemistry and Physics. General notions of\r\nNatural History; Principles of classification. Linear and imitative\r\nDrawing.\r\n\r\n  THE SECOND CLASS (_Seconde_,) at fifteen years old.\r\n\r\n  Algebra; Geometry, figures in space, recapitulation; Applications of\r\nGeometry, notions of the geometrical representations of bodies by\r\nprojections; Rectilineal Trigonometry; Chemistry; Physics; and Drawing.\r\n\r\n  THE RHETORIC, at sixteen years old.\r\n\r\n  Exercises in Arithmetic and Algebra; Geometry; notions on some common\r\ncurves; and general recapitulation; Applications of Geometry; notions of\r\nleveling and its processes; recapitulation of Trigonometry; Cosmography;\r\nMechanics; Chemistry concluded and reviewed; Zoölogy and Animal\r\nPhysiology; Botany and Vegetable Physiology; Geology; Drawing. (The\r\npupil may now be ready for the Degree and for St. Cyr.)\r\n\r\n  THE LOGIC, at seventeen years old.\r\n\r\n  Six lessons a week are employed in preparation for the bachelorship of\r\nscience, and in a methodical recapitulation of the courses of the three\r\npreceding years according to the state of the pupil’s knowledge.\r\n\r\n  Two lessons a week are allowed for reviewing the literary instruction;\r\nevening lessons in Latin, French, English, and German, and in History\r\nand Geography, having been given through the whole previous time.\r\n\r\n  THE SPECIAL MATHEMATICS, at eighteen and nineteen years old.\r\n\r\n  Five lessons a week are devoted to these studies; in the other lessons\r\nthe pupils join those of the Logic class for reviewing all their\r\nprevious subjects, whether for the bachelorship in science or for\r\ncompetition for admission at the _Ecole Normale_ or the Polytechnic.\r\n\r\nIt will only be necessary to add a few sentences in explanation of the\r\nmethods pursued in the upper classes of the _Lycées_. The classes are\r\nlarge--from 80 to above 100; the lessons strictly professorial lectures,\r\nwith occasional questions, as at the Polytechnic itself. In large\r\nestablishments the class is divided, and two professors are employed,\r\ngiving two parallel courses on the same subject. To correct and fortify\r\nthis general teaching, we find, corresponding to the interrogations of\r\nthe Polytechnic, what are here called conferences. The members of the\r\nlarge class are examined first of all in small detachments of five or\r\nsix by their own professors once a week; and, secondly, a matter of yet\r\ngreater importance, by the professor who is conducting the parallel\r\ncourse, and by professors who are engaged for this purpose from other\r\n_Lycées_ and preparatory schools, and from among the _répétiteurs_ of\r\nthe Polytechnic and the Ecole Normale themselves. It appeared by the\r\ntable of the examinations of this latter kind which had been passed by\r\nthe pupils of the class of Special Mathematics at the _Lycée_ St. Louis,\r\nthat the first pupil on the list had in the interval between the opening\r\nof the school and the date of our visit (February 16th) gone through as\r\nmany as twenty-four.\r\n\r\nThe assistants, who bear the name of _répétiteurs_ at the _Lycées_, do\r\nnot correspond in any sense to those whom we shall hereafter notice at\r\nthe Ecole Polytechnique. They are in the _Lycées_ mere superintendents\r\nin the _salles d’étude_, who attend to order and discipline, who give\r\nsome slight occasional help to the pupils, and may be employed in\r\ncertain cases, where the parents wish for it, in giving private tuition\r\nto the less proficient. The system of _salles d’étude_ appears to\r\nprevail universally; the number of the pupils placed in each probably\r\nvarying greatly. At the Polytechnic we found eight or ten pupils in\r\neach; at St. Cyr as many as 200. The number considered most desirable at\r\nthe _Lycée_ of St. Louis was stated to be thirty.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that in France not only do private establishments\r\nsucceed in giving preparation for the military schools, but that even in\r\nthe first-class public schools, which educate for the learned\r\nprofessions, it has been considered possible to conduct a series of\r\nmilitary or science classes by the side of the usual literary or arts\r\nclasses. The common upper schools are not, as they used to be, and as\r\nwith us they are, _Grammar_ schools, they are also _Science_ schools. In\r\nevery _Lycée_ there is, so to say, a sort of elementary polytechnic\r\ndepartment, giving a kind of instruction which will be useful to the\r\nfuture soldier, and at the same time to others, to those who may have to\r\ndo with mines, manufactures, or any description of civil engineering.\r\nThere is thus no occasion for Junior Military Schools in France, for all\r\nthe schools of this class are more or less of a military character in\r\ntheir studies.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of admission to the examination for the degree of\r\nBachelor of Science are simply, sixteen years of age, and the payment of\r\nfees amounting to about 200 fr. (10_l._) Examinations are held three\r\ntimes a year by the Faculties at Paris, Besançon, Bordeaux, Caen,\r\nClermont, Dijon, Grenoble, Lille, Lyons, Marseilles, Montpellier, Nancy,\r\nPoitiers, Rennes, Strasburg, and Toulouse, and once a year at Ajaccio,\r\nAlgiers, and nineteen other towns. There is a written examination of six\r\nhours, and a viva voce examination of an hour and a quarter. It is, of\r\ncourse, only a _pass_ examination, and is said to be much less difficult\r\nthan the competitive examination for admission to St. Cyr.--_Report of\r\nEnglish Commissioners_, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGE.\r\n\r\n  POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL AT PARIS,                                        11\r\n      SUBJECTS OF INSTRUCTION AS PRESCRIBED FOR ADMISSION IN 1850,    13\r\n      PREPARATORY COURSE IN THE LYCEES,                               49\r\n    HISTORY, MANAGEMENT, CONDITIONS OF ADMISSION, COURSE OF STUDY,\r\n        EXAMINATIONAL SYSTEM, AND RESULTS,                            55\r\n   I.

FOUNDATION AND HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the _Ecole Polytechnique_ dates from a period of disorder\r\nand distress in the history of France which might seem alien to all\r\nintellectual pursuits, if we did not remember that the general stimulus\r\nof a revolutionary period often acts powerfully upon thought and\r\neducation. It is, perhaps, even more than the Institute, the chief\r\nscientific creation of the first French Revolution. It was during the\r\ngovernment of the committee of public safety, when Carnot, as war\r\nminister, was gradually driving back the invading armies, and\r\nreorganizing victory out of defeat and confusion, that the first steps\r\nwere taken for its establishment. A law, dating the 1st Ventose, year\r\nII., the 12th of March 1794, created a “Commission des Travaux Publics,”\r\ncharged with the duty of establishing a regular system for carrying on\r\npublic works; and this commission ultimately founded a central school\r\nfor public works, and drew up a plan for the competitive examination of\r\ncandidates for admission to the service. It was intended at first to\r\ngive a complete education for some of the public services, but it was\r\nsoon changed into a preparatory school, to be succeeded by special\r\nschools of application. This was the Ecole Polytechnique.\r\n\r\nThe school and its plan were both owing to an immediate and pressing\r\nwant. It was to be partly military and partly civil. Military, as well\r\nas civil education had been destroyed by the revolutionists. The\r\ncommittee of public safety had, indeed, formed a provisional school for\r\nengineers at Metz, to supply the immediate wants of the army on the\r\nfrontier, and at this school young men were hastily taught the elements\r\nof fortification, and were sent direct to the troops, to learn as they\r\nbest could, the practice of their art. “But such a method,” says the\r\nreport accompanying the law which founded the school, “does not form\r\nengineers _in any true sense of the term_, and can only be justified by\r\nthe emergency of the time. The young men should be recalled to the new\r\nschool to complete their studies.” Indeed no one knew better than\r\nCarnot, to use the language of the report, “that patriotism and courage\r\ncan not always supply the want of knowledge;” and in the critical\r\ncampaigns of 1793-4, he must often have felt the need of the institution\r\nwhich he was then contributing to set on foot. Such was the immediate\r\nmotive for the creation of this school. At first, it only included the\r\nengineers amongst its pupils. But the artillery were added within a\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, omit to notice its civil character, the\r\ncombination of which with its military object forms its peculiar\r\nfeature, and has greatly contributed to its reputation. Amongst its\r\nfounders were men, who though ardent revolutionists, were thirsting for\r\nthe restoration of schools and learning, which for a time had been\r\ntotally extinguished. The chief of these, besides Carnot, were Monge and\r\nFourcroy, Berthollet and Lagrange. Of Carnot and Lagrange, one amongst\r\nthe first of war ministers, the other one of the greatest of\r\nmathematicians, we need not say more. Berthollet, a man of science and\r\npractical skill, first suggested the school; Monge, the founder of\r\nDescriptive Geometry, a favorite _savant_ of Napoleon though a zealous\r\nrepublican, united to real genius that passion for teaching and for his\r\npupils, which makes the _beau idéal_ of the founder of a school; and\r\nFourcroy was a man of equal practical tact and science, who at the time\r\nhad great influence with the convention, and was afterwards intrusted by\r\nNapoleon with much of the reorganization of education in France.\r\n\r\nWhen the school first started there was scarcely another of any\r\ndescription in the country. For nearly three years the revolution had\r\ndestroyed every kind of teaching. The attack upon the old schools, in\r\nFrance, as elsewhere, chiefly in the hands of the clergy, had been begun\r\nby a famous report of Talleyrand’s, presented to the legislative\r\nassembly in 1791, which recommended to suppress all the existing\r\nacademies within Paris and the provinces, and to replace them by an\r\nentirely new system of national education through the country. In this\r\nplan a considerable number of military schools were proposed, where boys\r\nwere to be educated from a very early age. When the violent\r\nrevolutionists were in power, they adopted the destructive part of\r\nTalleyrand’s suggestions without the other. All schools, from the\r\nuniversity downwards, were destroyed; the large exhibitions or\r\n_Bourses_, numbering nearly 40,000, were confiscated or plundered by\r\nindividuals, and even the military schools and those for the public\r\nworks (which were absolutely necessary for the very roads and the\r\ndefense of the country) were suppressed or disorganized. The school of\r\nengineers at Mézières (an excellent one, where Monge had been a\r\nprofessor,) and that of the artillery at La Fère, were both broken up,\r\nwhilst the murder of Lavoisier, and the well known saying in respect to\r\nit, that “the Republic had no need of chemists,” gave currency to a\r\nbelief, which Fourcroy expressed in proposing the Polytechnic, “that the\r\nlate conspirators had formed a deliberate plan to destroy the arts and\r\nsciences, and to establish their tyranny on the ruins of human reason.”\r\n\r\nThus it was on the ruin of all the old teaching, that the new\r\ninstitution was erected; a truly _revolutionary_ school, as its founders\r\ndelighted to call it, using the term as it was then commonly used, as a\r\nsynonym for all that was excellent. And then for the first time avowing\r\nthe principle of public competition, its founders, Monge and Fourcroy,\r\nbegan their work with an energy and enthusiasm which they seem to have\r\nleft as a traditional inheritance to their school. It is curious to see\r\nthe difficulties which the bankruptcy of the country threw in their way,\r\nand the vigor with which, assisted by the summary powers of the\r\nrepublican government, they overcame them. They begged the old Palais\r\nBourbon for their building; were supplied with pictures from the Louvre;\r\nthe fortunate capture of an English ship gave them some uncut diamonds\r\nfor their first experiments; presents of military instruments were sent\r\nfrom the arsenals of Havre; and even the hospitals contributed some\r\nchemical substances. In fine, having set their school in motion, the\r\ngovernment and its professors worked at it with such zeal and effect,\r\nthat within five months after their project was announced, they had held\r\ntheir first entrance examination, open to the competition of all France,\r\nand started with three hundred and seventy-nine pupils.\r\n\r\nThe account of one of these first pupils, who is among the most\r\ndistinguished still surviving ornaments of the Polytechnic, will convey\r\na far better idea of the spirit of the young institution than could be\r\ngiven by a more lengthy description. M. Biot described to us vividly the\r\nzeal of the earliest teachers, and the thirst for knowledge which,\r\nrepressed for awhile by the horrors of the period, burst forth with\r\nfresh ardor amongst the French youth of the time. Many of them, he said,\r\nlike himself, had been carried away by the enthusiasm of the revolution,\r\nand had entered the army. “My father had sent me,” he added, “to a\r\nmercantile house, and indeed I never felt any great vocation to be a\r\nsoldier, but _Que voulez vous? les Prussiens etaient en Champagne._” He\r\njoined the army, served two years under Dumouriez, and returned to Paris\r\nin the reign of terror, “to see from his lodgings in the Rue St. Honore\r\nthe very generals who had led us to victory, Custine and Biron, carried\r\nby in the carts to the guillotine. “Imagine what it was when we heard\r\nthat Robespierre was dead, and that we might return safely to study\r\nafter all this misery, and then to have for our teachers La Place,\r\nLagrange, and Monge. We felt like men brought to life again after\r\nsuffocation. Lagrange said, modestly, “Let me teach them arithmetic.”\r\nMonge was more like our father than our teacher; he would come to us in\r\nthe evening, and assist us in our work till midnight, and when he\r\nexplained a difficulty to one of our _chefs de brigade_, it ran like an\r\nelectric spark through the party.” The pupils were not then, he told us,\r\nas they have since been, shut up in barracks, they were left free, but\r\nthere was no idleness or dissipation amongst them. They were united in\r\nzealous work and in good _camaraderie_, and any one known as a bad\r\ncharacter was avoided. This account may be a little tinged by\r\nenthusiastic recollections, but it agreed almost entirely with that of\r\nM. de Barante, who bore similar testimony to the early devotion of the\r\npupils, and the unique excellence of the teaching of Monge.\r\n\r\nWe are not, however, writing a history of this school, and must confine\r\nourselves to such points as directly illustrate its system of teaching\r\nand its organization. These may be roughly enumerated in the following\r\norder:\r\n\r\n1. Its early history is completed by the law of its organization, given\r\nit by La Place in his short ministry of the interior. This occurred in\r\nthe last month of 1799, a memorable era in French history, for it was\r\nimmediately after the revolution of the 18th of Brumaire, when Napoleon\r\noverthrew the Directory and made himself First Consul. One of his\r\nearliest acts was to sign the charter of his great civil and military\r\nschool. This charter or decree deserves some attention, because it is\r\nalways referred to as the law of the foundation of the school. It\r\ndetermined the composition of the two councils of instruction and\r\nimprovement, the bodies to which the direction of the school was to be,\r\nand still is, intrusted; some of its marked peculiarities in the mode\r\nand subject of teaching. It is important to notice each of the two\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the school was at first almost entirely in the hands of\r\nits professors, who formed what is still called its Council of\r\nInstruction. Each of them presided over the school alternately for one\r\nmonth, a plan copied from the revolutionary government of the\r\nConvention. In the course of a few years, however, another body was\r\nadded, which has now the real management of the school. This is called\r\nthe “Council of Improvement” (_Conseil de perfectionnement_,) and a part\r\nof its business is to see that the studies form a good preparation for\r\nthose of the more special schools (_écoles d’application_) for the civil\r\nand military service. It consists of eminent men belonging to the\r\nvarious public departments supplied by the school, and some of the\r\nprofessors. It has had, as far as we could judge, an useful influence;\r\n_first_, as a body not liable to be prejudiced in its proposals by the\r\nfeelings of the school, and yet interested in its welfare and\r\nunderstanding it; _secondly_, as having shown much skill in the\r\ndifficult task of making the theoretical teaching of the Polytechnic a\r\ngood introduction to the practical studies of the public service;\r\n_thirdly_, as being sufficiently influential, from the character of its\r\nmembers, to shield the school from occasional ill-judged interference.\r\nIt should be added that hardly any year has passed without the Council\r\nmaking a full report on the studies of the school, with particular\r\nreference to their bearing on the Special Schools of Application.\r\n\r\nThe method of scientific teaching has been peculiar from the beginning.\r\nIt is the most energetic form of what may be called the _repetitorial_\r\nsystem, a method of teaching almost peculiar to France, and which may be\r\ndescribed as a very able combination of professional and tutorial\r\nteaching. The object of the _répétiteur_, or private tutor, is to second\r\nevery lecture of the professor, to explain and fix it by ocular\r\ndemonstration, explanations, or examination. This was a peculiarity in\r\nthe scheme of Monge and Foureroy. The latter said, in the first\r\nprogramme, “Our pupils must not only learn, they must at once carry out\r\ntheir theory. We must distribute them into small rooms, where they shall\r\npractice the plans of descriptive geometry, which the professors have\r\njust shown them in their public lectures. And in the same manner they\r\nmust go over in practice (_répéteront_) in separate laboratories the\r\nprincipal operations of chemistry.” To carry out this system the twenty\r\nbest pupils, of whom M. Biot was one, were selected as _répétiteurs_\r\nsoon after the school had started. Since then the vacancies have always\r\nbeen filled by young but competent men, aspiring themselves to become in\r\nturn professors. They form a class of teachers more like the highest\r\nstyle of private tutors in our universities, or what are called in\r\nGermany _Privat-docenten_, than any other body--with this difference,\r\nthat they do not give their own lectures, but breaking up the\r\nprofessor’s large class into small classes of five and six pupils,\r\nexamine these in _his_ lecture. The success of this attempt we shall\r\ndescribe hereafter.\r\n\r\n2. A change may be noticed which was effected very early by the Council\r\nof Improvement--the union of pupils for artillery and engineers in a\r\nsingle school of application. The first report in December 1800, speaks\r\nof the identity in extent and character of the studies required for\r\nthese two services; and in conformity with its recommendation, the law\r\nof the 3rd of October 1802, (12th Vendémiaire, XI.) dissolved the\r\nseparate artillery school at Châlons, and established the united school\r\nfor both arms in the form which it still retains at Metz.\r\n\r\n3. In 1805 a curious change was made, and one very characteristic of the\r\nschool. The pupils have always been somewhat turbulent, and generally on\r\nthe side of opposition. In the earliest times they were constantly\r\ncharged with _incivisme_, and the aristocracy was said to have “taken\r\nrefuge within its walls.” In fact, one of its earliest and of its few\r\ngreat _literary_ pupils, M. de Barante, confirmed this statement,\r\nadding, as a reason, that the school gave for a while the only good\r\ninstruction in France. It was in consequence of some of these changes\r\nthat the pupils who had hitherto lived in their own private houses or\r\nlodgings in Paris, were collected in the school building. This\r\n“_casernement_” said to be immediately owing to a burst of anger of\r\nNapoleon, naturally tended to give the school a more military character;\r\nbut it was regarded as an unfortunate change by its chief scientific\r\nfriends. “_Ah! ma pauvre école!_” M. Biot told us he had exclaimed, when\r\nhe saw their knapsacks on their beds. He felt, he said, that the\r\nenthusiasm of free study was gone, and that now they would chiefly work\r\nby routine and compulsion.\r\n\r\n4. The year 1809 may be called the epoch at which the school attained\r\nits final character. By this time the functions, both of boards and\r\nteachers, were accurately fixed, some alterations in the studies had\r\ntaken place, and the plan of a final examination had been drawn up,\r\naccording to which the pupils were to obtain their choice of the branch\r\nof the public service they preferred. In fact, the school may be said to\r\nhave preserved ever since the form it then assumed, under a variety of\r\ngovernments and through various revolutions, in most of which, indeed,\r\nits pupils have borne some share; and one of which, the restoration of\r\n1816, was attended with its temporary dissolution.\r\n\r\nThus, during the first years after its foundation the Polytechnic grew\r\nand flourished in the general dearth of public teaching, being indeed\r\nnot merely the only great school, but, until the Institute was founded,\r\nthe only scientific body in France. Working on its first idea of high\r\nprofessorial lectures, practically applied and explained by\r\n_répétiteurs_, its success in its own purely scientific line was, and\r\nhas continued to be, astonishing. Out of its sixteen earliest\r\nprofessors, ten still retain an European name. Lagrange, Monge,\r\nFourcroy, La Place, Guyton de Morveau were connected with it. Malus,\r\nHauy, Biot, Poisson, and De Barante, were among its earliest pupils.\r\nArago, Cauchy, Cavaignac, Lamoricière, with many more modern names, came\r\nlater. All the great engineers and artillerymen of the empire belonged\r\nto it, and the long pages in its calendar of distinguished men are the\r\nmeasure of its influence on the civil and military services of France.\r\nIn fact its pupils, at a time of enormous demands, supplied all the\r\nscientific offices of the army, and directed all the chief public works,\r\nfortresses, arsenals, the improvement of cities, the great lines of\r\nroads, shipbuilding, mining--carried out, in a word, most of the great\r\nimprovements of Napoleon. He knew the value of his school, “the hen” as\r\nhe called it, “that laid him golden eggs”--and perhaps its young pupils\r\nwere not improved by the excessive official patronage bestowed by him\r\nupon “the envy of Europe,” “the first school in the world.” It can not,\r\nhowever, be matter of surprise, that its vigor and success should have\r\ncaused Frenchmen, even those who criticise its influence severely, to\r\nregard it with pride as an institution unrivaled for scientific\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to give any detailed account of the later history of\r\nthe school, but we must remark that disputes have frequently arisen with\r\nregard to the best mode of harmonizing its teaching with that of the\r\nspecial schools of application to which it conducts. These disputes have\r\nbeen no doubt increased by the union of a civil and military object in\r\nthe same school. The scientific teaching desirable for some of the\r\nhigher civil professions has appeared of doubtful advantage to those\r\ndestined for the more practical work of war. There has been always a\r\ndesire on the one side to qualify pure mathematics by application, a\r\nstrong feeling on the other that mathematical study sharpens the mind\r\nmost keenly for some of the practical pursuits of after life. We should\r\nadd, perhaps, that there has been some protest in France (though little\r\nheard among the scientific men who have been the chief directors of the\r\nschool) against the _esprit faux_, the exclusive pursuit of mathematics\r\nto the utter neglect of literature, and the indifference to moral and\r\nhistorical studies. Some one or other of these complaints any one who\r\nstudies the _literature_, the pamphlets, and history of the school will\r\nfind often reproduced in the letters of war ministers, of artillery and\r\nengineer officers commanding the school of application at Metz, or of\r\ncommittees from the similar schools for the mines and the roads and\r\nbridges. The last of these occasions illustrates the present position of\r\nthe school.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of June 1850, the legislative assembly appointed a mixed\r\ncommission of military men and civilians, who were charged to revise all\r\nthe programs of instruction, and to recommend all needful changes in the\r\nstudies of the pupils, both those preparatory to entrance[9] and those\r\nactually pursued in the school. The commission was composed as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  M. Thenard, Member of the Academy of Sciences, and of the Board of\r\nImprovement of the Polytechnic School, President.\r\n\r\n  Le Verrier, Member of the Academy of Sciences and of the Legislative\r\nAssembly, Reporter.\r\n\r\n  Noizet, General of Brigade of Engineers.\r\n\r\n  Poncelet, General of Brigade of Engineers, Commandant of the\r\nPolytechnic School, Member of the Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\n  Piobert, General of Brigade of Artillery, Member of the Academy of\r\nSciences.\r\n\r\n  Mathieu, Rear Admiral.\r\n\r\n  Duhamel, Member of the Academy of Sciences, Director of Studies at the\r\nPolytechnic School.\r\n\r\n  Mary, Divisional Inspector of Roads and Bridges.\r\n\r\n  Morin, Colonel of Artillery, Member of the Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\n  Regnault, Engineer of Mines, Member of the Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\n  Olivier, Professor at the _Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers_.\r\n\r\n  Debacq, Secretary for Military Schools at the Ministry of War,\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: In an Analysis of the Report of this Commission, see\r\n    page 97.]\r\n\r\nA chronic dispute which has gone on from the very first year of the\r\nschool’s existence, between the exclusive study of abstract mathematics\r\non the one hand, and their early practical application on the other, was\r\nbrought to a head (though it has scarcely been set at rest) by this\r\ncommission. All the alterations effected have been in the direction of\r\neliminating a portion of the pure mathematics, and of reducing abstract\r\nstudy to the limits within which it was believed to be most directly\r\napplicable to practice. The results, however, are still a subject of\r\nvehement dispute, in which most of the old scientific pupils of the\r\nPolytechnic, and many of what may be styled its most practical members,\r\nthe officers of the artillery and engineers, are ranged on the side of\r\n“early and deep scientific study _versus_ early practical applications.”\r\nIt is, indeed, a question which touches the military pupils nearly,\r\nsince it is in their case particularly that the proposed abstract\r\nstudies of the Polytechnic might be thought of the most doubtful\r\nadvantage. We do not try to solve the problem here, though the facts\r\nelsewhere stated will afford some materials for judgment. We incline to\r\nthe opinion of those who think that the ancient _genius loci_, the\r\ntraditional teaching of the school, will be too strong for legislative\r\ninterference, and that, in spite of recent enactments, abstract science\r\nand analysis will reign in the lecture-rooms and halls of study of the\r\nPolytechnic, now as in the days of Monge.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. AN OUTLINE OF THE MANAGEMENT AND OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SCHOOL,\r\nETC.\r\n\r\nThe Polytechnic, as we have said, is a preparatory and general\r\nscientific school; its studies are not exclusively adapted for any one\r\nof the departments to which at the close of its course the scholars will\r\nfind themselves assigned; and on quitting it they have, before entering\r\non the actual discharge of their duties of whatever kind, to pass\r\nthrough a further term of teaching in some one of the schools of\r\napplication specially devoted to particular professions.\r\n\r\nThe public services for which it thus gives a general preparation are\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n  _Military: Under the Minister at War._\r\n    Artillery (_Artillerie de terre_.)\r\n    Engineers (_Génie_.)\r\n    The Staff Corps (_Corps d’Etat Major_.)\r\n    The Department of Powder and Saltpetre (_Poudres et Salpétres_.)\r\n\r\n  _Under the Minister of Marine._\r\n    Navy, (_Marine_.)\r\n    Marine Artillery (_Artillerie de mer_.)\r\n    Naval Architects (_Génie maritime_.)\r\n    The Hydrographical Department (_Corps des Ingénieurs Hydrographes_.)\r\n\r\n  _Civil: Under the Minister of Public Works._\r\n    The Department of Roads and Bridges (_Ponts-et-chaussées_.)\r\n    The Department of Mines (_Mines_.)\r\n\r\n  _Under the Minister of the Interior._\r\n    The Telegraph Department (_Lignes Télégraphiques_.)\r\n\r\n  _Under the minister of Finance._\r\n    The Tobacco Department (_Administration des Tabacs_.)\r\n\r\nTo these may be added at any time, by a decree on the part of the\r\ngovernment, any other departments, the duties of which appear to require\r\nan extensive knowledge of mathematics, physics, or chemistry.\r\n\r\nAdmission to the school is, and has been since its first commencement in\r\n1794, obtained by competition in a general examination, held yearly, and\r\nopen to all. Every French youth, between the age of sixteen and twenty,\r\n(or if in the army up to the age of twenty-five,) may offer himself as a\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\nA board of examiners passes through France once every year, and examines\r\nall who present themselves, that have complied with the conditions,\r\nwhich are fully detailed in the decree given in the appendix. It\r\ncommences at Paris.\r\n\r\nA list of such of the candidates as are found eligible for admittance to\r\nthe Polytechnic is drawn up from the proceedings of the board, and\r\nsubmitted to the minister at war; the number of places likely to be\r\nvacant has already been determined, and the minister fixes the number of\r\nadmissions accordingly. The candidates admitted are invariably taken in\r\nthe order of merit.\r\n\r\nThe annual charge for board and instruction is 40_l._ (1,000 fr.,)\r\npayable in advance in four installments. In addition there is the cost\r\nof outfit, varying from 20_l._ to 24_l._ Exhibitions, however, for the\r\ndischarge of the whole or of one-half of the expense (_bourses_ and\r\n_demi-bourses_,) are awarded by the state in favor of _all_ the\r\nsuccessful candidates, whose parents can prove themselves to be too poor\r\nto maintain their children in the school. Outfits and half outfits\r\n(_trousseaux_) and _demi-trousseaux_) are also granted in these cases,\r\non the entrance of the student into the school; and the number of these\r\n_boursiers_ and _demi-boursiers_ amounts at the present time to\r\none-third of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe course of study is completed in two years. On its successful\r\ntermination which is preceded by a final examination, the students are\r\ndistributed into the different services, the choice being offered them\r\nin the order of their merit, and laid down in the classified list drawn\r\nup after the examination. If it so happen that the number of places or\r\nthe services which can be offered is not sufficient for the number of\r\nqualified students, those at the bottom of the list are offered service\r\nin the infantry or cavalry, and those who do not enter the public\r\nservice, are supplied with certificates of having passed successfully\r\nthrough the school. Students who have been admitted into the school from\r\nthe army, are obliged to re-enter the army.\r\n\r\nAll others, as has been said, have the right of choosing, according to\r\ntheir position on the list, the service which they prefer, so far, that\r\nis, as the number of vacancies in that service will allow; or they may\r\nif they please decline to enter the public service at all.\r\n\r\nSuch is a general outline of the plan and object of the school. We may\r\nadd that, besides its military staff, it employs no less than\r\nthirty-nine professors and teachers; that it has four boards of\r\nmanagement, and that ten scientific men unconnected with the school, and\r\namongst the most distinguished in France, conduct its examinations. The\r\nmagnitude of this establishment for teaching may be estimated by the\r\nfact, that the number of pupils rarely exceeds three hundred and fifty,\r\nand is often much less.\r\n\r\nA fuller enumeration of these bodies will complete our present sketch.\r\n\r\nI. The military establishment consists of:--\r\n\r\n  The Commandant, a General Officer, usually of the Artillery or the\r\nEngineers, at present a General of Artillery.\r\n\r\n  A Second in Command, a Colonel or Lieutenant-Colonel, chosen from\r\nformer pupils of the school; at present a Colonel of Engineers.\r\n\r\n  Three Captains of Artillery and Three Captains of Engineers, as\r\nInspectors of Studies, chosen also from former pupils of the school.\r\n\r\n  Six Adjutants (_adjoints_,) non-commissioned officers, usually such as\r\nhave been recommended for promotion.\r\n\r\nII. The civil establishment consists of:--\r\n\r\n  1. A Director of Studies, who has generally been a civilian, but is at\r\npresent a Lieutenant-Colonel of Engineers.\r\n\r\n  2. Fifteen Professors, viz.:--Two of Mathematical Analysis. Two of\r\nMechanics and Machinery. One of Descriptive Geometry. Two of Physics.\r\nTwo of Chemistry. One of Military Art and Fortification. One of Geodesy.\r\nOne of Architecture. One of French Composition. One of German. One of\r\nDrawing. Of these one is an officer of the Staff, another of the\r\nArtillery, and a third of the Navy; two are Engineers in Chief of the\r\nRoads and Bridges; nine are civilians, of whom two are Members of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences.\r\n\r\n  3. Three Drawing Masters for Landscape and Figure Drawing; one for\r\nMachine Drawing, and one for Topographical Drawing.\r\n\r\n  4. Nineteen Assistant and Extra Assistant Teachers, (_répétiteurs_ and\r\n_répétiteurs adjoints_) whose name and functions are both peculiar.\r\n\r\n  5. Five Examiners for Admission, consisting at present of one Colonel\r\nof Artillery, as President, and four civilians.\r\n\r\n  6. Five Examiners of Students (civilians,) four of them belonging to\r\nthe Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\n  7. There is also a separate Department for the ordinary Management of\r\nAdministration of the affairs of the school, the charge of the fabric\r\nand of the library and museums; and a Medical Staff.\r\n\r\nIII. The general control or supervision of the school is vested, under\r\nthe war department, in four great boards of councils, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. A board of administration, composed of the commandant, the second in\r\ncommand, the director of studies, two professors, two captains, and two\r\nmembers of the administrative staff. This board has the superintendence\r\nof all the financial business and all the minutiae of the internal\r\nadministration of the school.\r\n\r\n2. A board of discipline, consisting of the second in command, the\r\ndirector, two professors, three captains (of the school,) and two\r\ncaptains of the army, chosen from former pupils. The duty of this board\r\nis to decide upon cases of misconduct.\r\n\r\n3. A board of instruction, whose members are, the commandant, the second\r\nin command, the director, the examiners of students, and the professors;\r\nand whose chief duty is to make recommendations relating to\r\nameliorations in the studies, the programmes of admission and of\r\ninstruction in the school, to--\r\n\r\n4. A board of improvement, charged with the general control of the\r\nstudies, formed of--\r\n\r\n  The Commandant, as President.\r\n\r\n  The Second in Command.\r\n\r\n  The Director of Studies.\r\n\r\n  Two Delegates from the Department of Public Works.\r\n\r\n  One Delegate from the Naval Department.\r\n\r\n  One Delegate from the Home Department.\r\n\r\n  Three Delegates from the War Department.\r\n\r\n  Two Delegates from the Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\n  Two Examiners of Students.\r\n\r\n  Three Professors of the School.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CONDITIONS AND EXAMINATIONS FOR ADMISSION.\r\n\r\nThe entrance examination is held yearly in August; the most important\r\nconditions for admission to it are always inserted in the _Moniteur_\r\nearly in the year, and are--\r\n\r\n1st. All candidates must be bachelors of science.\r\n\r\n2nd. All candidates (unless they have served in the army) must have been\r\nas much as sixteen and not more than twenty years old on the 1st of\r\nJanuary preceding.\r\n\r\n3rd. Privates and non-commissioned officers of the army must be above\r\ntwenty and under twenty-five years of age; must have served two years,\r\nand have certificates of good conduct.\r\n\r\n4th. Candidates who propose to claim pecuniary assistance (a _bourse_ or\r\n_demi-bourse_) must present formal proofs of their need of it.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the entrance examination are the following:--\r\n\r\n  _Arithmetic_, including Vulgar and Decimal Fractions, Weights and\r\nMeasures, Involution and Evolution; Simple Interest.\r\n\r\n  _Geometry_ of Planes and Solids; application of Geometry to Surveying;\r\nProperties of Spherical Triangles.\r\n\r\n  _Algebra_, including Quadratic Equations with one unknown quantity,\r\nSeries and Progressions in general; Binomial Theorem and its\r\napplications; Logarithms and their use; on Derived Functions; on the\r\nTheory of Equations; on Differences; application of the Theory of\r\nDifferences to the Numerical Solution of Equations.\r\n\r\n  _Plane and Spherical Trigonometry_; Solution of Triangles; application\r\nof Trigonometry to Surveying.\r\n\r\n  _Analytical Geometry_, including Geometry of two dimensions;\r\nCo-ordinates; Equations of the first and second degree, with two\r\nvariables; Tangents and Asymptotes; on the Ellipse, Hyperbola, and\r\nParabola; Polar Co-ordinates; Curved Lines in general.\r\n\r\n  _Geometry of three dimensions_, including the Theory of Projections;\r\nCo-ordinates; the Right Line and Plane; Surfaces of the second degree;\r\nConical and Cylindrical Surfaces.\r\n\r\n  _Descriptive Geometry_; Problems relative to a Point, Right Line and\r\nPlane; Tangent Planes; Intersection of Surfaces.\r\n\r\n  _Mechanics_; on the Movement of a Point considered geometrically; on\r\nthe Effect of Forces applied to points and bodies at rest and moving; on\r\nthe Mechanical Powers.\r\n\r\n  _Natural Philosophy_, including the Equilibrium of Liquids and Gasses;\r\nHeat; Electricity; Magnetism; Galvanism; Electro-magnetism and Light;\r\nCosmography.\r\n\r\n  _Chemistry_, the Elements; _French_; _German_; _Drawing_, and\r\n(optionally) _Latin_.\r\n\r\nThis examination is partly written and partly oral. It is not public,\r\nbut conducted in the following manner:--\r\n\r\nFive examiners are appointed by the minister of war to examine the\r\ncandidates at Paris, and at the several towns named for the purpose\r\nthroughout France.\r\n\r\nTwo of these examiners conduct what may be called a preliminary\r\nexamination (_du premier degré_,) and the other three a second\r\nexamination (_du second degré_.) The preliminary examiners precede by a\r\nfew days in their journey through France those who conduct the second\r\nexamination. The written compositions come before either.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary examination (_du premier degré_) is made solely for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining whether the candidates possess sufficient\r\nknowledge to warrant their being admitted to the second examination; and\r\nthe second examination serves, in conjunction with the written\r\ncompositions, for their classification in the order of merit.\r\n\r\nPrior to the examination, each candidate is called upon to give in\r\ncertain written sheets containing calculations, sketches, plans and\r\ndrawings, executed by him at school during the year, certified and dated\r\nby the professor under whom he has studied. Care is taken to ascertain\r\nwhether these are the pupils’ own work, and any deception in this\r\nmatter, if discovered, excludes at once from the competition of the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThis done, the candidates are required to reply in writing to written or\r\nprinted questions, and to write out French and German exercises; great\r\ncare being taken to prevent copying. This written examination occupies\r\nabout twenty-four hours during three and a half separate days, as shown\r\nin the following table. It usually takes place in the presence of\r\ncertain official authorities, the examiners not being present.\r\n\r\n      _First Sitting._\r\n                                        Hours.\r\n  Arithmetic,                             1\r\n  Geometry,                               1\r\n  Latin,                                  1\r\n                                         --\r\n                                          3\r\n\r\n      _Second Sitting._\r\n\r\n  Algebra,                                1\r\n  History, geography, and French,         3\r\n                                         --\r\n                                          4\r\n\r\n      _Third Sitting._\r\n\r\n  Descriptive geometry, and }\r\n    diagram, or sketch,     }             4\r\n\r\n       _Fourth Sitting._\r\n\r\n  Mechanics,                              1\r\n  Physics, chemistry, and cosmography,    2\r\n                                         --\r\n                                          3\r\n\r\n      _Fifth Sitting._\r\n                                        Hours.\r\n  Applied analysis,                     1½\r\n  German exercise,                      1½\r\n                                        -----\r\n                                          3\r\n\r\n      _Sixth Sitting._\r\n\r\n  Solution of a triangle by logarithms    3\r\n\r\n      _Seventh Sitting._\r\n\r\n  Drawing                                 4\r\n                                     --------------\r\n  Total                                  24 hours\r\n\r\nNext, each candidate is examined orally for three-quarters of an hour,\r\non two successive days, by each of the two examiners separately, and\r\neach examiner makes a note of the admissibility or non-admissibility of\r\nthe candidate.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this oral examination, the notes relating to the various\r\ncandidates are compared, and if the examiners differ as to the\r\nadmissibility of any candidate, he is recalled, further orally examined,\r\nand his written exercises carefully referred to, both examiners being\r\npresent. A final decision is then made.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary examiners then supply the others with a list of the\r\ncandidates who are entitled to be admitted to the second oral\r\nexamination. On this occasion each candidate is separately examined for\r\none hour and a half by each examiner, but care is taken that in all the\r\nprincipal subjects of study the candidate is examined by at least two\r\nout of the three examiners.\r\n\r\nEach examiner records his opinion of the merits of every candidate in\r\nreplying, orally and in writing, by awarding him a credit varying\r\nbetween O and 20, the highest number indicating a very superior result.\r\n\r\nThis scale of merit is employed to express the value of the oral\r\nreplies, written answers, or drawings. It has the following\r\nsignification, and appears to be generally in use in the French military\r\nschools:--\r\n\r\n  20    denotes perfect.\r\n\r\n  19}\r\n  18}    “   very good.\r\n\r\n  17}\r\n  16}    “   good.\r\n  15}\r\n\r\n  14}\r\n  13}    “   passable.\r\n  12}\r\n\r\n  11}\r\n  10}    “   middling.\r\n   9}\r\n\r\n   8}\r\n   7}    “   bad.\r\n   6}\r\n\r\n   5}\r\n   4}    “   very bad.\r\n   3}\r\n\r\n   2}\r\n   1}    “   almost nothing.\r\n\r\n   0}    “   nothing.\r\n\r\nConsiderable latitude is granted to the examiner engaged in deciding\r\nupon the amount of credit to be allowed to the student, for the manner\r\nin which he replies to the various questions. He is expected to bear in\r\nmind the temperament of the candidate, his confidence or timidity, as\r\nwell as the difficulty of the questions, when judging of the quality of\r\nthe reply, more value being given for an imperfect answer to a difficult\r\nquestion than for a more perfect reply to an easy one.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the examiners, together with the various documents\r\nbelonging to each candidate, are sent from each town to the minister at\r\nwar, who transmits them to the commandant of the Polytechnic School to\r\nmake out a classified list.\r\n\r\nVery different value of course is attached to the importance of some of\r\nthe subjects, when compared with others; and the measure of the\r\nimportance is represented in French examinations by what are termed\r\n_co-efficients of influence_, varying for the several subjects of study\r\nand kind of examination. The particular co-efficients of influence for\r\neach subject in these written and oral examinations, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                      Co-efficients of Influence.\r\n\r\n  Oral examination--analytical mathematics,                   20}\r\n   “        “       geometrical ditto,                        14}  52\r\n   “        “       physics and mechanics,                    16}\r\n   “        “       German language,                           2}\r\n\r\n  Written compositions on mathematical subjects,               5}\r\n     “         “      descriptive geometry, drawing, and\r\n                        description,                           5}\r\n     “         “    logarithmic calculations of a triangle,    2}\r\n     “         “    mechanics,                                 2}\r\n     “         “    physics or chemistry,                      4}  34\r\n  German exercise,                                             1}\r\n  French composition,                                          5}\r\n  Latin translation,                                           5}\r\n  Copy of a drawing,                                           5}\r\n                                                               --\r\n  Total,                                                       86\r\n                                                               --\r\n\r\nIn order to make out the above mentioned classified list, the respective\r\ncredits awarded by the examiners to each candidate are multiplied by the\r\nco-efficients representing the weight or importance attached to each\r\nsubject; and the sum of their products furnishes a numerical result,\r\nrepresenting the degree of merit of each candidate.\r\n\r\nA comparison of these numerical results is then made, and a general list\r\nof all the candidates is arranged in order of merit.\r\n\r\nThis list, and the whole of the documents from which it has been drawn\r\nup, are then submitted to a jury composed of the\r\n\r\n  Commandant of the School.\r\n\r\n  The Second in Command.\r\n\r\n  The Director of Studies.\r\n\r\n  Two Members of the Board of Improvement.\r\n\r\n  The Five Examiners.\r\n\r\nIt is the special business of this jury carefully to scrutinize the\r\nwhole of the candidates’ documents, drawings, &c., and they further take\r\ncare that a failure in any one branch of study is duly noted, as such\r\nfailure is a sufficient reason for the exclusion of the candidate from\r\nthe general list.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this general list has been thoroughly verified, it is\r\nsubmitted to the minister of war, who is empowered to add one-tenth to\r\nthe number actually required for the public services; and thus it may\r\nhappen that one-tenth of the pupils may annually be disappointed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE SCHOOL BUILDINGS AND THE COURSE AND METHOD OF STUDY.\r\n\r\nA brief description of the buildings may be a suitable introduction to\r\nan account of the studies that are pursued, and the life that is led in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Polytechnic School stands near the Pantheon, and consists of two\r\nmain buildings, one for the official rooms and the residence of the\r\ncommandant and director of studies, the other, and larger one, for the\r\npupils. Detached buildings contain the chemical lecture room and\r\nlaboratory, the laboratory of natural philosophy, the library, fencing\r\nand billiard rooms.\r\n\r\nThe basement floor of the larger building contains the kitchen and\r\nrefectories. On the first floor, are the two amphitheaters or great\r\nlecture rooms, assigned respectively to the pupils of the two years or\r\ndivisions, in which the ordinary lectures are given. The rooms are large\r\nand well arranged; the seats fixed, the students’ names attached to\r\nthem. The students are admitted by doors behind the upper tier of seats;\r\nat the foot of all is a platform for the professor, with a blackboard\r\nfacing his audience, and with sufficient room for a pupil to stand and\r\nwork questions beside him. Room also is provided for one of the\r\ncaptains, inspectors of studies, whose duty it is to be present, for the\r\ndirector of studies, whose occasional presence is expected, and for the\r\nassistant teachers or _répétiteurs_, who in the first year of their\r\nappointment are called upon to attend the course upon which they will\r\nhave to give their subsequent questions and explanations. On this floor\r\nare also the museums, or repositories of models, instruments, machines,\r\n&c., needed for use in the amphitheaters, or elsewhere. The museum\r\nprovided for the lecturer on Physics (or Natural Philosophy) appeared in\r\nparticular to be well supplied.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the second floor is taken up with what are called the\r\n_salles d’interrogation_, a long series of small cabinets or studies,\r\nplainly furnished with six or eight stools and a table, devoted to the\r\n_interrogations particulières_, which will presently be described.\r\n\r\nThe third floor contains the halls of study, _salles d’étude_, or\r\nstudying rooms, in which the greater part of the student’s time during\r\nthe day is passed--where he studies, draws, keeps his papers and\r\ninstruments, writes his exercises, and prepares his lectures. These are\r\nsmall chambers, containing eight or, exceptionally, eleven occupants. A\r\ndouble desk runs down the middle from the window to the door, with a\r\nlittle shelf and drawers for each student. There is a blackboard for the\r\ncommon use, and various objects are furnished through the senior\r\nstudent, the sergeant, a selected pupil, more advanced than the rest,\r\nwho is placed in charge of the room, and is responsible for whatever is\r\nhanded in for the use of the students. He collects the exercises, and\r\ngenerally gives a great deal of assistance to the less proficient. “When\r\nI was sergeant,” said an old pupil, “I was always at the board.” The\r\nspirit of _camaraderie_, said to exist so strongly among the Polytechnic\r\nstudents, displays itself in this particular form very beneficially.\r\nYoung men of all classes work heartily and zealously together in the\r\n_salles d’étude_, and no feeling of rivalry prevents them from assisting\r\none another. The sergeant does not, however, appear to exercise any\r\nauthority in the way of keeping discipline.\r\n\r\nThese chambers for study are arranged on each side of a long corridor\r\nwhich runs through the whole length of the building, those of the\r\njuniors being separated from those of the seniors by a central chamber\r\nor compartment, the _cabinet de service_, where the officers charged\r\nwith the discipline are posted, and from hence pass up and down the\r\ncorridor, looking in through the glass doors and seeing that no\r\ninterruption to order takes place.\r\n\r\nThe fourth story is that of the dormitories, airy rooms, with twelve\r\nbeds in each. These rooms are arranged as below, along the two sides of\r\na corridor, and divided in the same manner into the senior and junior\r\nside. A non-commissioned officer is lodged at each end of the corridor\r\nto see that order is kept.\r\n\r\nSuch is the building into which at the beginning of November the\r\nsuccessful candidates from the _Lycées_ and the _Ecoles préparatoires_\r\nare introduced, in age resembling the pupils whom the highest classes of\r\nEnglish public schools send annually to the universities, and in number\r\nequal perhaps to the new under-graduates at one of the largest colleges\r\nat Cambridge. There is not, however, in other points much that is\r\ncommon, least of all in the methods and habits of study we are about to\r\ndescribe. This will be best understood by a summary of a day’s work.\r\n\r\nThe students are summoned to rise at half-past five, have to answer the\r\nroll-call at six, from six to eight are to occupy themselves in study,\r\nand at eight they go to breakfast. On any morning except Wednesday, at\r\nhalf-past eight, we should find the whole of the new admission assembled\r\nin an amphitheater, permanent seats in which are assigned to them by\r\nlot, and thus placed they receive a lecture from a professor, rough\r\nnotes of which they are expected to take while it goes on. The first\r\nhalf hour of the hour and a half assigned to each lecture is occupied\r\nwith questions put by the professor relating to the previous lecture.\r\nA name is drawn by lot, the student on whom the lot falls is called up\r\nto the blackboard at which the professor stands, and is required to work\r\na problem and answer questions. The lecture concluded, the pupils are\r\nconducted to the _salles d’étude_, which have just been described, where\r\nthey are to study. Here for one hour they devote themselves to\r\ncompleting and writing out in full the notes of the lecture they have\r\njust heard. The professor and his assistants, the _répétiteurs_, are\r\nexpected to follow and make a circuit through the corridors, to give an\r\nopportunity to ask for information on any difficult points in the\r\nlecture. A lithographed summary of the substance of the lecture,\r\nextending perhaps to two octavo pages, is also furnished to each\r\nstudying room for the use of its pupils.\r\n\r\nThe lecture, as we have said, commences at half-past eight o’clock; it\r\nlasts an hour and a half; the hour of writing up the notes brings us to\r\neleven. The young men are now relieved by a change of occupation, and\r\nemploy themselves (still in their places in the rooms of study) at\r\ndrawing. A certain number, detached from the rest, are sent to the\r\nphysical and chemical laboratories. The rotation is such as to admit\r\neach student once a month to two or three hours’ work at a furnace for\r\nchemistry, and once in two months to make experiments in electricity, or\r\nother similar subjects. In this way, either at their drawing or in the\r\nlaboratories, they spend three hours, and at two o’clock go to their\r\ndinner in the refectories below, and after dinner are free to amuse\r\nthemselves in the court-yard, the library, the fencing and the billiard\r\nrooms, till five. At five they return to the studying rooms, and for two\r\nhours, on Mondays and Fridays, they may employ themselves on any work\r\nthey please (_étude libre_;) on Tuesday there is a lecture in French\r\nliterature, and on Thursday in German; at seven o’clock they commence a\r\nlesson, which lasts till nine, in landscape and figure drawing, or they\r\ndo exercises in French writing or in German; at nine they go down to\r\nsupper; at half-past nine they have to answer to a roll-call in their\r\nbedrooms, and at ten all the lights are put out.\r\n\r\nWednesday is a half-holiday, and the pupils are allowed to leave the\r\nschool after two o’clock, and be absent till ten at night. The morning\r\nis occupied either in study, at the pleasure of the students, or in set\r\nexercises till eleven, when there is a lecture of one hour and a half,\r\nfollowed, as usual, by an hour of special study on the subject of the\r\nlecture. On Sunday they are allowed to be absent almost the whole day\r\ntill ten P.M. There is no chapel, and apparently no common religious\r\nobservance of any kind in the school.\r\n\r\nSuch is a general sketch of the ordinary employment of the day; a couple\r\nof hours of preparatory study before breakfast, a lecture on the\r\ndifferential calculus, on descriptive geometry, on chemistry, or natural\r\nphilosophy, followed by an hour’s work at notes; scientific drawing till\r\ndinner; recreation; and general study, or some lighter lecture in the\r\nevening. Were we merely to count the hours, we should find a result of\r\neleven or eleven and a half hours of work for every day but Wednesday,\r\nand of seven and a half hours for that day. It is to be presumed,\r\nhowever, that though absolute idleness, sleeping, or reading any book\r\nnot authorized for purposes of study, is strictly prohibited, and when\r\ndetected, punished, nevertheless the strain on the attention during the\r\nhours of drawing and the lectures of the evening is by no means extreme.\r\nLandscape and figure drawing, the lecture in French literature, and\r\nprobably that in German, may fairly be regarded as something like\r\nrecreation. Such, at least, was the account given us of the lectures on\r\nliterary subjects, and it agrees with the indifference to literature\r\nwhich marks the school. Of wholesome out-of-door recreation, there\r\ncertainly seems to be a considerable want. There is nothing either of\r\nthe English love of games, or of the skillful athletic gymnastics of the\r\nGerman schools.\r\n\r\nThe method of teaching is peculiar. The plan by which a vast number of\r\nstudents are collected as auditors of professorial lectures is one\r\npursued in many academical institutions, at the Scotch universities, and\r\nin Germany. Large classes attend the lectures in Greek, in Latin, and in\r\nmathematics at Glasgow; they listen to the professor’s explanations,\r\ntake notes, are occasionally questioned, and do all the harder work in\r\ntheir private lodgings. Such a system of course deserves in the fullest\r\nsense the epithet of voluntary; a diligent student may make much of it;\r\nbut there is nothing to compel an idle one to give any attention.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been one especial object pursued in the Polytechnic to\r\ngive to this plan of instruction, so lax in itself, the utmost possible\r\nstringency, and to accumulate upon it every attainable subsidiary\r\nappliance, every available safeguard against idleness. Questions are\r\nexpressly put _vivâ voce_ by the professor before his lecture; there is\r\na subsequent hour of study devoted to the subject; there is the\r\nopportunity for explanation to individual students; the exaction of\r\nnotes written out in full form; the professor also gives exercises to\r\nthe students to write during their hours of general study, which he\r\nexamines, and marks; general vivâ voce examinations (_interrogations\r\ngénérales_,) conducted by the professors and _répétiteurs_, follow the\r\ntermination of each course of lectures; and lastly, one of the most\r\nimportant and peculiar parts of the method, we have what are called the\r\n_interrogations particulières_. After every five or six lectures in each\r\nsubject, each student is called up for special questioning by one of the\r\n_répétiteurs_. The rooms in which these continual examinations are held\r\nhave been described. They occupy one entire story of the building; each\r\nholds about six or eight pupils, with the _répétiteurs_. Every evening,\r\nexcept Wednesday, they are filled with these little classes, and busy\r\nwith these close and personal questionings. A brief notice, at the\r\nutmost of twenty-four hours, is served upon the students who are thus to\r\nbe called up. Generally, after they have had a certain number of\r\nlectures, they may expect that their time is at hand, but the precise\r\nhour of the summons can not be counted upon. The scheme is continually\r\nvaried, and it defies, we are told, the efforts of the ablest young\r\nanalysts to detect the law which it follows.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at once that such a system, where, though nominally\r\nprofessorial, so little is left to the student’s own voluntary action,\r\nwhere the ordinary study and _reading_, as it is called in our English\r\nuniversities (here such an expression is unknown) is subjected to such\r\nunceasing superintendence and surveillance, and to so much careful\r\nassistance, requires an immense staff of teachers. At the Polytechnic,\r\nfor a maximum of 350 pupils, a body of fifteen professors and\r\ntwenty-four _répétiteurs_, are employed, all solely in actual\r\ninstruction, and in no way burdened with any part of the charge of the\r\ndiscipline or the finance, or even with the great yearly examinations\r\nfor the passage from the first to the second division, and for the\r\nentrance to the public services.\r\n\r\nWith a provision of one instructor to every eight students, it is\r\nprobable that in England we should avoid any system of large classes,\r\nfrom the fear of the inferior pupils being unable to keep pace with the\r\nmore advanced. We should have numerous small classes, and should\r\nendeavor, above all things, to obtain the advantage of equality of\r\nattainment in the pupils composing them.\r\n\r\nThe French, on the other hand, make it their first object to secure one\r\nable principal teacher in each subject, a professor whom they burden\r\nwith very few lectures. And to meet the educational difficulty thus\r\ncreated, to keep the whole large class of listeners up to the prescribed\r\npoint, they call in this numerous and busily employed corps of\r\nassistants to _repeat_, to go over the professor’s work afresh, to whip\r\nin, as it were, the stragglers and hurry up the loiterers. Certainly,\r\none would think, a difficult task with a class of 170 freshmen in such\r\nwork as the integral and differential calculus. It is one, however, in\r\nwhich they are aided by a stimulus which evidently acts most powerfully\r\non the students of the Polytechnic School. During the two years of their\r\nstay, the prospect of their final admission to the public services can\r\nrarely be absent from the thoughts even of the least energetic and\r\nforethinking of the young men. Upon their place in the last class list\r\nwill depend their fortune for life. A high position will secure them not\r\nonly reputation, but the certainty of lucrative employment; will put it\r\nin their power to select which service they please, and in whichever\r\nthey choose will secure them favorable notice. Let it be remembered that\r\nfifty-three of these one hundred and seventy are free scholars, born of\r\nparents too poor to pay 40_l._ a year for their instruction; to whom\r\nindustry must be at all times a necessity, and industry during their two\r\nyears at the Polytechnic the best conceivable expenditure, the most\r\ncertainly remunerative investment of their pains and labor. The place on\r\nthe final class list is obviously the prize for which this race of two\r\nyears’ length has to be run. What is it determines that place? Not by\r\nany means a final struggle before the winning-post, but steady effort\r\nand diligence from first to last throughout the course. For the order of\r\nthe class list is not solely determined by success in the examination\r\nafter which it is drawn up, but by the result of previous trials and\r\nprevious work during the whole stay at the school.\r\n\r\nFor, during the whole time, every written exercise set by the professor,\r\nevery drawing, the result of every _interrogation particulière_ by the\r\n_répétiteurs_, and of each general interrogation by the professors and\r\n_répétiteurs_, is carefully marked, and a credit placed according to the\r\nname of the student and reserved for his benefit, in the last general\r\naccount. The marks obtained in the examination which closes the first\r\nyear of study form a large element in this last calculation. It had been\r\nfound that the work of the first year was often neglected: the evil was\r\nquickly remedied by this expedient. The student, it would seem, must\r\nfeel that he is gaining or losing in his banking account, so to call it,\r\nby every day’s work; every portion of his studies will tell directly for\r\nor against him in the final competition, upon which so much depends.\r\n\r\nSuch is the powerful mechanism by which the French nation forces out of\r\nthe mass of boys attending their ordinary schools the talent and the\r\nscience which they need for their civil and military services. The\r\nefforts made for admission to this great scientific school of the public\r\nservices, the struggle for the first places at the exit from it, must be\r\nmore than enough, it is thought, to establish the habits of hard work,\r\nto accumulate the information and attainment, and almost to create the\r\nability which the nation requires for the general good.\r\n\r\nWe may now follow the student through his course of two years’ study.\r\nThe first year’s work may be mainly divided into three portions of\r\nunequal length; two of them of about four months each (with an\r\nadditional fortnight of private study and examination,) are mainly given\r\nto hard lecturing, whilst the third portion of two months is devoted to\r\nprivate study and to the examinations.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this arrangement of the year, the four hardest\r\nsubjects are thus distributed. Analysis and descriptive geometry, the\r\nstaple work of the school--its Latin, as M. de Barante called it--come\r\nin the first four months; there is then a pause for private study and a\r\ngeneral examination in these two subjects (_interrogations générales_ as\r\ndistinct from the _interrogations particulières_ of the _répétiteurs_.)\r\nThis brings us to the middle of March. Analysis and geometry are then\r\nlaid aside for the rest of the year, and for the next portion of four\r\nmonths the pupils work at mechanics and geodesy, private study and a\r\ngeneral examination completing this course also. Important lectures on\r\nphysics and chemistry run on during both these periods, and are\r\nsimilarly closed by private study and a general examination. The less\r\ntelling evening classes of French literature and German end at the\r\nbeginning of June, and landscape and figure drawing only last half the\r\nyear. It may be observed also, that, as a general rule, there is on each\r\nday one, and only one, really difficult lecture. This is immediately\r\npreceded and followed by private study, but then comes something\r\nlighter, as a relief, such as drawing or work in the laboratories.\r\n\r\nThe chief feature in the third portion of the year is the complete break\r\nin the lectures for general private study (_étude libre_,) a month or\r\nsix weeks before the closing examination at the end of the year. The\r\nimmediate prospect of this prevents any undue relaxing of the work; and\r\nit is curious to observe here how private efforts and enforced system\r\nare combined together, for even the private efforts are thus\r\nsystematized and directed. The closing examination of the first year\r\nbegins on the 1st and ends on the 25th of September.\r\n\r\nThe total number of lectures in each branch of study, with the dates\r\nwhen they respectively commence and finish, and the period when the\r\ngeneral examinations (_interrogations générales_) take place, are\r\nexhibited in the following tables, and we should add that the interval\r\nbetween the close of each course and the commencement of the chief\r\nyearly examination is devoted to free study.\r\n\r\n  TABLE FOR THE SECOND OR LOWER DIVISION, FOLLOWING THE FIRST YEAR’S\r\n  COURSE OF STUDY.\r\n\r\n  [KEY]\r\n  L  No. of Lectures\r\n  C  Commenced.\r\n  F  Finished.\r\n  GE General Examinations _Interrogations Générales._\r\n\r\n  ------------------+---+---------------------+---------------------\r\n                    | L | Course of Lectures. |General Examinations.\r\n                    |   |                     |  _Interrogations\r\n                    |   |                     |     Gènèrales._\r\n                    |   +----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n  Subject of Study. |   |  C       |  F       |  C       |  F\r\n  ------------------+---+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n  Analysis          | 48| 3rd Nov. |25 Feb.   |13th March|18th March\r\n  Mechanics         | 40|21st March|29th June |24th July |2nd August\r\n    & Machines      | 40|21st March|29th June |24th July |2nd August\r\n  Descriptive       | 38| 3rd Nov. |3rd March |13th March|18th March\r\n    Geometry        | 38| 3rd Nov. |3rd March |13th March|18th March\r\n  Physics           | 34| 2nd  “   |28th June |10th July |19th July\r\n  Chemistry         | 38| 5th  “   |17th  “   |10th  “   |19th  “\r\n  Geodesy           | 35|20th March|30th  “   |24th  “   |2nd August\r\n  French Literature | 30| 8th Nov. | 6th  “   |          |\r\n  German            | 30| 2nd  “   |15th  “   |          |\r\n  Figure and        | 50| 4th  “   |28th April|          |\r\n    Landscape       |   |          |          |          |\r\n    Drawing         |---|          |          |          |\r\n  Total             |343|          |          |          |\r\n  ------------------+---+----------+----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\n  [Annual Examination begins on the 1st Sept., and ends on the 25th\r\n  Sept.]\r\n\r\nThe work of the second year is almost identical in its general plan with\r\nthat of the first.

Chemistry and physics\r\nfollow the same course as during the first year, and terminate with the\r\nprivate study and the general examination at the beginning of August.\r\nThe evening lectures in French literature and German end about the\r\nmiddle of June, and those in figure and landscape drawing at the\r\nbeginning of May.

THE EXAMINATIONS, PARTICULARLY THAT OF THE FIRST YEAR AND THE FINAL\r\nONE.\r\n\r\nWe have now brought the pupil nearly to the end of his career, but must\r\npreviously say a few words about his examinations, the chief epochs\r\nwhich mark his progress, and the last of which fixes his position almost\r\nfor life. For this purpose it is necessary to recapitulate briefly what\r\nhas been said in different places of the whole examinatorial system of\r\nthe Polytechnic School.\r\n\r\n1. All the professors require the students in their studying rooms, to\r\nanswer questions in writing on the courses as they go through them: a\r\ndifferent question is given to each student, and every third question is\r\nof such a nature as to involve a numerical example in the reply.\r\n\r\nThese questions are given in the proportion of one to about every four\r\nlectures, and the replies after being examined by the professor or\r\n_répétiteur_, are indorsed with a credit, varying from 0 to 20, and the\r\npaper is then given back to the student, to be produced at the close of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\n2. Credits are assigned to the students for their ordinary manipulations\r\nin chemistry and physics, during the first year; and at the close of\r\neach year, for their manipulations, in chemistry alone, before the\r\nexaminers.\r\n\r\n3. The _répétiteurs_ examine, (in the _interrogations particulières_,)\r\nevery ten or fourteen days, from six to eight students during a sitting\r\nof two hours, on the subject of study lectured on since the previous\r\nexamination of the same kind. All these students must continue present,\r\nand at the close the _répétiteur_ assigns to each a previous examination\r\nof the same kind. All these students must continue present, and at the\r\nclose the _répétiteur_ assigns to each a credit entirely dependent on\r\nthe manner in which each has replied. The professors and captains\r\ninspectors are occasionally present at these examinations, which are\r\ndiscontinued at certain periods according to the instructions of the\r\ndirector of studies.\r\n\r\n4. At different intervals of time, from a fortnight to a month, as may\r\nhappen, after the close of the course in each branch of study, general\r\nexaminations (_interrogations générales_) are made by the professors and\r\n_répétiteurs_. From four to six students are examined together for at\r\nleast two hours, and at the conclusion the professor makes known to the\r\ndirector of studies the credit he has granted to each student for the\r\nmanner in which he has passed his examination.\r\n\r\nSuch may be called the minor or ordinary examinations. But there is an\r\nannual closing examination at the end of each year, which we will now\r\ndescribe. The first year’s annual examination commences on the 1st and\r\nends on the 25th September. It is carried on by special examiners,\r\n(a different set from those who conduct the entrance examinations,) and\r\nnot by the professors. These give to every student a credit between 0\r\nand 20 in each branch of study, according to the manner in which he\r\nreplies.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the co-efficients of influence allowed to the\r\ndifferent studies of the first year, subdivided also among the\r\nparticular classes of examination to which the student has been\r\nsubjected. The component parts of the co-efficients as well as the\r\nco-efficients themselves, slightly vary from year to year, dependent on\r\nthe number of examinations:--\r\n\r\n  TABLE I.--FIRST YEAR’S COURSE OF STUDIES: SECOND DIVISION.\r\n\r\n  [KEY]\r\n  TC Total Co-efficients.

He is accordingly excluded from the school,\r\nunless he has been prevented from pursuing his studies by illness, in\r\nwhich case, when the facts are thoroughly established, he will be\r\nallowed a second year’s study in the second division, comprising the\r\nfirst year’s course of study.\r\n\r\nWe now pass to the second annual or great final examination for\r\nadmission to the public services, remarking only that in the\r\n_interrogations générales_ of the second year the principal subjects of\r\nboth years are included.\r\n\r\nThe final examinations for admission into the public service commence\r\nabout the 10th September, and last about one month. They are conducted\r\nby the same examiners who examined at the close of the first year. These\r\nare five in number, and appointed by the minister of war. One of these\r\ntakes analysis; a second, mechanics; a third, descriptive geometry and\r\ngeodesy; the fourth, physics; and the fifth, chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe examination in military art and topography is conducted by a captain\r\nof engineers specially appointed for the purpose; and in the same manner\r\nthe examination in German is carried on by a professor, usually a\r\ncivilian, specially but not permanently appointed.\r\n\r\nThe questions are oral, and extend over the whole course of study\r\npursued during the two years. Each student is taken separately for one\r\nhour and a quarter on different days by each of the five examiners; each\r\nexaminer examines about eight students daily.\r\n\r\nA table, very similar to that already given, is prepared under the\r\nsuperintendence of the Director of studies for every student, to\r\nascertain the numerical amount of his credits in each branch of study,\r\nthe co-efficients of influences for the particular subject of study and\r\nnature of examination being extracted from a table similar to that in\r\npage 80, and when these tables have all been completed, a general list\r\nof all the students is made out, arranged in the order of their merits.\r\n\r\nFormerly, conduct was permitted to exercise some slight influence on\r\ntheir position, but that is no longer the case.\r\n\r\nThe same regulations exist, as regards the minimum amount of credit that\r\nwill entitle the students to enter into the public service, as have\r\nalready been stated above in reference to the passage from the first to\r\nthe second year’s course of study.\r\n\r\n  TABLE II.

As a\r\nstimulus to continuous and unceasing exertion, it will be seen by an\r\ninspection of the tables of the co-efficients of influence, that the\r\nmanner in which the students acquit themselves from day to day, and from\r\nweek to week, is made an element, and a very important one, in\r\ndetermining their final position in the list arranged according to\r\nmerit, exceeding as it does in most instances the influence exerted on\r\ntheir classification by their final examination at the close of each\r\nyear. This principle thus recognizes not only their knowledge at the end\r\nof each year, but also the manner in which they have proved it to the\r\nprofessors and _répétiteurs_ in the course of the year; and with\r\nreference to the second year’s study, the final result of the first\r\nyear’s classification exercises an influence amounting to about\r\none-third of the whole, in the final classification at the end of the\r\nsecond year.\r\n\r\nIt follows also, that as the examinations at the end of each year are\r\nmade by examiners, otherwise unconnected with the school, and not by the\r\nprofessors belonging to it, the positions of the students in the\r\nclassified list is partly dependent on the judgment of the professors\r\nwith whom they are constantly in communication, and partly on the public\r\nexaminers, whom they meet only in the examination rooms.[10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: The influence exercised in the various branches of\r\n    study, and consequently in the position of the students in the\r\n    list classified according to merit, by the professors and\r\n    _répétiteurs_ on the one hand, and by the examiners on the other,\r\n    as in the table above.]\r\n\r\nThe examiners of the students are not frequently changed, and\r\npractically the same may be said of the examiners for admission.\r\n\r\n  [KEY]\r\n  PR By Professors and _Répétiteurs_.\r\n  Ex By Examiners.\r\n  Y1 By the results of the first Year’s Examination.\r\n\r\n  -------------------+---------------------------------------------\r\n  Subjects of Study. |  Per-centage of influence exercised on the\r\n                     |  position of the Students.\r\n                     +-----------++-----------------++-------------\r\n                     |During the || During the      ||In the Classified\r\n                     | 1st Year. || 2nd Year.       ||List at the end\r\n                     |           ||                 ||of 2nd year.\r\n                     +-----------++-----------------++-------------\r\n                     | PR  | Ex  || Y1  | PR  | Ex  || PR  | Ex\r\n  -------------------+-----+-----++-----+-----+-----++-----+-------\r\n  Analysis,          | 50.0| 50.0|| 34.5| 32.5| 33.0|| 49.7| 50.25\r\n  Mechanics,         | 63.2| 36.7|| 27.2| 42.4| 30.4|| 59.6| 40.40\r\n  Descriptive        |     |     ||     |     |     ||     |\r\n    Geometry,        | 62.5| 37.5||100.0|  0.0|  0.0|| 62.5| 37.5\r\n  Geodesy,           | 53.8| 46.2||  0.0| 51.4| 48.6||*51.4| 48.6\r\n  Physics,           | 53.3| 46.7|| 33.8| 33.8| 32.4|| 51.8| 48.2\r\n  Chemistry,         | 60.0| 40.0|| 29.4| 43.2| 27.4|| 60.8| 39.2\r\n  Architecture,      | ..  | ..  ||  0.0|100.0|  0.0||100.0|100.0\r\n  Military Art and   |     |     ||     |     |     ||     |\r\n    Topography,      | ..  | ..  ||  0.0| 68.0| 32.0|| 68.0| 32.0\r\n  French Literature, |100.0|  0.0|| 33.3| 66.7|  0.0||100.0|  0.0\r\n  German Language,   |100.0|  0.0|| 33.3| 33.3| 33.4|| 66.7| 33.3\r\n  Drawing,           |100.0|  0.0|| 33.3| 66.7|  0.0||100.0|  0.0\r\n  Shading and        |     |     ||     |     |     ||     |\r\n    Tinting Plans,   |100.0|  0.0|| 40.0| 60.0|  0.0||100.0|  0.0\r\n                     |     |     ||     |     | *   ||     |\r\n  -------------------+-----+-----++-----+-----+-----++-----+-------\r\n\r\n  [* When taught in the 2nd year]\r\n\r\nThe students at the head of the list have generally since the wars of\r\nthe first Empire entered into the civil rather than into the military\r\nservices, the former being much better remunerated.\r\n\r\nThe services are usually selected by preference, nearly in the following\r\norder:--\r\n\r\n  The Roads and Bridges (_Ponts et chaussées_)} very nearly on an\r\n    and Mines (_Mines_,)                       }   equality.\r\n  Powder and Saltpetre (_Poudres et Salpêtres._)\r\n  Naval Architects (_Génie maritime._)\r\n  Engineers (_Génie militaire._)\r\n  The Artillery (_Artillerie de terre._) }\r\n    and the Staff Corps (_Etat Major_,)  } very nearly on an equality.\r\n  The Hydographical Corps (_Ingénieurs Hydrographes._)\r\n  Tobacco Department (_Administration des Tabacs._)\r\n  Telegraph Department (_Lignes Télégraphiques._)\r\n  Navy (_Marine._)\r\n  Marine Artillery (_Artillerie de mer._)\r\n\r\nSuch, at least, is the result of a comparison of the selections made by\r\nthe students during eight different years.\r\n\r\nThis preference of the civil to the military services has been the\r\nsubject of frequent complaints on the part of the military authorities\r\nto the minister of war.\r\n\r\nNo steps have, however, been taken by the French government to prevent\r\nthe _free_ choice of a profession being granted to the most successful\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nWe have now followed the student at the Polytechnic to the end of his\r\nschool career. He is then to pass to his particular School of\r\nApplication, in which (as the name implies) he is taught to apply his\r\nscience to practice. It is difficult to state precisely the amount of\r\nsuch science which the highest pupils may be thought to possess on\r\nleaving; the best idea of it will be gained by reference to the\r\nprogrammes of the most important of the lectures. It is also needless to\r\ndwell again on the main features of the school--the emulation called\r\nforth, the minute method, the great prizes offered for sustained labor.\r\nWe must, however, make some remarks on these points before concluding\r\nour account, so far as they bear on the subject of military education.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. GENERAL REMARKS.\r\n\r\n  1. Keeping out of sight for the moment some defects both in the\r\nprinciples and details of the education of this school, the method of\r\nteaching adopted seems to us excellent, and worthy of careful study. In\r\nthis remark we allude principally to the skillful combination of two\r\nmethods which have been generally thought incompatible; for it unites\r\nthe well-prepared lecture of a German professor, with the close personal\r\nquestioning of a first-rate English school or college lecture. But\r\nbesides this, its whole system is admirably adapted for the class of\r\npupils it educates.\r\n\r\n  These pupils are generally not of the wealthy classes; they are able,\r\nand struggling for a position in life. On all these grounds their own\r\nassistance in the work may be calculated upon. Yet they are not left to\r\nthemselves to make the most of their professors’ lectures. The aid of\r\n_répétiteurs_, even more valuable in its constant “prudent\r\ninterrogations,” than in the explanations afforded, is joined to the\r\nstimulus given by marking every step of proficiency, and by making all\r\ntell on the last general account. But though the routine and method of\r\nthe school are so elaborate, play is given to the individual freedom of\r\nthe pupils in their private work, and this is managed so skillfully that\r\nthe private work is made immediately to precede the final examination,\r\non which mainly depends the pupil’s place for life. Thus from first to\r\nlast they are carried on by their system without being cramped by it;\r\nevery circumstance favorable to study is made the most of; rigorous\r\nhabit, mental readiness, the power of working with others, and the power\r\nof working for themselves, the ambition for immediate and permanent\r\nsuccess, all the objects and all the methods which students ever have in\r\nview, support and stimulate those of the Polytechnic in their two years’\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\n  2. The mainspring, however, of the school’s energy is the competition\r\namongst the pupils themselves, and this could hardly exist without the\r\ngreat prizes offered to the successful. This advantage, added to the\r\ngeneral impulse of the early days of the Empire, has no doubt powerfully\r\ncontributed to the great position of the school. It has made it a kind\r\nof university of the _élite_ mathematicians, and as in England young men\r\nlook to the prizes of the universities, and the professions to which\r\nthey lead, as their best opening in life, so in France, ever since the\r\nfirst revolution, the corresponding class has inclined to the active and\r\nchiefly military career which is offered by the great competitive school\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n  3. A preparatory school of this remarkable character can not but\r\nexercise a very powerful influence over those three-fourths of its\r\npupils who leave it to enter the army. The obvious question is whether\r\nthe attempt is not made to teach more than is either necessary or\r\ndesirable for military purposes, and to this suspicion may be added the\r\nfact that the civil prizes being more in request than the military, many\r\nof those who enter the army do so in the first instance reluctantly, and\r\nthat the pupils at the bottom of the list appear to be often such marked\r\nfailures as to imply either great superficiality or premature\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\n  4. In studying the Polytechnic School we have had these points\r\nconstantly brought before us, and feeling the difficulty of discussing\r\nthem fully, we beg to invite attention to the evidence sent us in reply\r\nto some questions which we addressed on the subject to some\r\ndistinguished scientific officers and civilians connected with the\r\nschool. We will give briefly the result of our own inquiries.\r\n\r\n  5. The complaint of General Paixhans has been quoted. He urges that a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the army pupils are mere _queues de\r\npromotion_, and quite insufficient to form _le corps et surtout la tête_\r\nof troops _d’élite_.\r\n\r\n  Other not inconsistent complaints we heard ourselves, of the mental\r\nexhaustion and the excessively abstract tendencies of many of the\r\nmilitary pupils of the school.\r\n\r\n  6. Such are the complaints. There is certainly reason to think that,\r\nwith regard to the twenty or thirty lowest pupils on the list, those of\r\nGeneral Paixhans are well founded. These are the _breaks down_, and we\r\nare at first surprised that, entering as they must do,[11] with high\r\nattainments, they should fall so low as the marks in the tables (with\r\nwhich we are most liberally supplied) prove to be the case.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: The students are selected, by a competitive\r\n    examination, out of a very large number of candidates, as will be\r\n    seen from the following table, extracted from the yearly\r\n    calendars:--\r\n\r\n      -----+------------+------------+-------------\r\n           | Candidates |            |\r\n           |    who     |            | Candidates\r\n      Year.| inscribed  | Candidates |  admitted\r\n           |   their    | examined.  |   to the\r\n           |   Names.   |            | Polytechnic.\r\n      -----+------------+------------+-------------\r\n      1832 |    567     |    468     |     183\r\n      1833 |    367     |    304     |     110\r\n      1834 |    627     |    541     |     150\r\n      1835 |    729     |    633     |     154\r\n      .....|............|............|............\r\n      1837 |    629     |    508     |     137\r\n      1838 |    533     |    410     |     131\r\n      1839 |    530     |    531     |     135\r\n      .....|............|............|............\r\n      1842 |    709     |    559     |     137\r\n      1843 |    802     |    559     |     166\r\n      1844 |    746     |    531     |     143\r\n      1845 |    780     |    559     |     136\r\n      -----+------------+------------+-------------\r\n\r\n    Giving an average of one student for four candidates _examined_,\r\n    so that it is impossible to imagine that there is any lack of\r\n    ability in those selected.\r\n\r\n    A similar result appears to follow from some other more recent\r\n    statistics.\r\n\r\n      -----+---------------+-----------------+----------\r\n      Year.|  Number of    | Number declared |  Number\r\n           |  Candidates   |   admissible    | admitted.\r\n           | who inscribed | to the Second   |\r\n           |  their Names. |  Examination.   |\r\n      -----+---------------+-----------------+----------\r\n      1852 |  510          |  216            |  202\r\n      1853 |  494          |  222            |  217\r\n      1854 |  519          |  238            |  170\r\n      1855 |  544          |  232            |  170\r\n      -----+---------------+-----------------+----------\r\n\r\n    In judging, however, of these numbers, it should be borne in mind\r\n    that, a very large number of the candidates who succeed have tried\r\n    more than once; the successful of this year have been among the\r\n    unsuccessful of last year, so that the proportion of individuals\r\n    who succeed to individuals who fail, is, of course, considerably\r\n    larger than one to four. Of the 170 candidates admitted in\r\n    November, 1855, 117 had put down their names for the examination\r\n    of 1854, and 53 only had not been previously inscribed. Of the 117\r\n    who put down their names, 19 had withdrawn without being examined\r\n    at all, 71 had been rejected on the preliminary examination, 27\r\n    had been unsuccessful at that of the second degree; 98 of the 170\r\n    came up for the second time to the examination.]\r\n\r\n  At the same time, we believe that no teaching ever has provided or\r\nwill provide against many failures out of one hundred and seventy\r\npupils, even among those who promised well at first: and if the standard\r\nof the majority of pupils is high at the Polytechnique, and the point\r\nreached by the first few _very_ high, it is no reproach that the descent\r\namongst the last few should be very rapid.\r\n\r\n  With regard to the assertion, that the teaching is excessive and leads\r\ntoo much to abstract pursuits for soldiers, it may be partially true.\r\nPerhaps the general passion for science has led to an overstrained\r\nteaching for the army, even for its scientific corps; and yet would it\r\nbe allowed by officers of the highest scientific ability, either in the\r\nFrench or the English army, that less science is required for the\r\ngreatest emergencies of military than for those of civil engineering, or\r\nfor the theory of projectiles than for working the department of\r\nsaltpetre?\r\n\r\n  It may, however, be true that an attempt is made at the Polytechnic to\r\nexact _from all_ attainments which can only be reached by _a few_.\r\n\r\n  7. With this deduction, we must express our opinion strongly in favor\r\nof the influence of the Polytechnic on the French army. We admit that in\r\nsome instances pupils who have failed in their attempt at civil prizes\r\nenter the army unwillingly, but they are generally soon penetrated with\r\nits _esprit de corps_, and they carry into it talent which it would not\r\notherwise have obtained. Cases of overwork no doubt occur, as in the\r\nearly training for every profession, but (following the evidence we have\r\nreceived) we have no reason to think them so numerous as to balance the\r\nadvantage of vigorous, thoughtful study directed early towards a\r\nprofession which, however practical, is eminently benefited by it. “It\r\ncan not be said,” was the verdict of one well fitted to express an\r\nopinion, “that there is too much science in the French army.”\r\n\r\n  8. Assuming, however, the value of the scientific results produced in\r\nthe French army by the Polytechnic, it by no means follows that a\r\nsimilar institution would be desirable in another country. Without much\r\ndiscussion it may be safely said that the whole history and nature of\r\nthe institution--the offspring of a national passion for system and of\r\nrevolutionary excitement--make it thoroughly peculiar to France.\r\n\r\n  9. Some obvious defects must be noticed. The curious rule of\r\nforbidding the use of _all_ books whatever is a very exaggerated attempt\r\nto make the pupil to rely entirely on the professors and _répétiteurs_.\r\nThe exclusive practice of _oral_ examination also seems to us a defect.\r\nCertainly every examination should give a pupil an opportunity of\r\nshowing such valuable qualities as readiness and power of expression;\r\nbut an examination solely oral appears to us an uncertain test of depth\r\nor accuracy of knowledge; and however impartial or practiced an examiner\r\nmay be, it is impossible that questions put orally can present exactly\r\nthe same amount of difficulty, and so be equally fair, to the several\r\ncompetitors.\r\n\r\n  At the same time, although in all great competing examinations the\r\nchief part of the work (in our opinion) should be _written_, the\r\nconstant oral cross-questioning of the minor examinations at the\r\nPolytechnic, appeared to be one of the most stimulating and effective\r\nparts of their system,\r\n\r\n  10. A more serious objection than any we have named lies against the\r\nexclusive use of mathematical and scientific training, to the neglect of\r\nall other, as almost the only instrument of education. The spirit of the\r\nschool, as shown especially by its entrance examinations, is opposed to\r\nany literary study. This is a peculiar evil in forming characters for a\r\nliberal profession like the army. Such a plan may indeed produce\r\nstriking results, if the sole object is to create distinguished\r\nmathematicians, though even then the acuteness in one direction is often\r\naccompanied by an unbalanced and extravagant judgment in another. But a\r\ngreat school should form the whole and not merely a part of the man; and\r\nas doing this, as strengthening the whole mind, instead of forcing on\r\none or two of its faculties--as giving, in a word, what is justly called\r\na _liberal_ education--we are persuaded that the system of cultivating\r\nthe taste for historical and other similar studies, as well as for mere\r\nscience, is based on a sounder principle than that which has produced\r\nthe brilliant results of the Polytechnic.\r\n\r\n  11. It may be added, in connection with the above remark, that as the\r\nentrance examination at the Polytechnic influences extensively the\r\nteaching of the great French schools, and is itself almost solely\r\nmathematical, it tends to diffuse a narrow and exclusive pursuit of\r\nscience, which is very alien from the spirit of English teaching.\r\n\r\n  12. We may sum up our remarks on the Polytechnic School thus:--\r\n\r\n  Regarded simply as a great Mathematical and Scientific School, its\r\nresults in producing eminent men of science have been extraordinary. It\r\nhas been the great (and a truly great) Mathematical University of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\n  Regarded again as a Preparatory School for the public works, it has\r\ngiven a very high scientific education to civil engineers, whose\r\nscientific education in other countries (and amongst ourselves) is\r\nbelieved to be much slighter and more accidental.\r\n\r\n  Regarded as a school for the scientific corps of the army, its\r\npeculiar mode of uniting in one course of competition candidates for\r\ncivil and military services, has probably raised scientific thought to a\r\nhigher point in the French than in any other army.\r\n\r\n  Regarded as a system of teaching, the method it pursues in developing\r\nthe talents of its pupils appears to us the best we have ever studied.\r\n\r\n  It is in its studies and some of its main principles that the example\r\nof the Polytechnic School may be of most value. In forming or improving\r\nany military school, we can not shut our eyes to the successful working\r\nat the Polytechnic of the principle, which it was the first of all\r\nschools to initiate, the making great public prizes the reward and\r\nstimulus of the pupil’s exertions. We may observe how the state has here\r\nencouraged talent by bestowing so largely assistance upon all\r\nsuccessful, but poor pupils, during their school career. We may derive\r\nsome lessons from its method of teaching, though the attempt to imitate\r\nit might be unwise. Meanwhile, without emulating the long established\r\nscientific prestige of the Polytechnic, we have probably amongst\r\nourselves abundant materials for a military scientific education, at\r\nleast as sound as that given at this great School.\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Schools of Application for Artillery and Engineers at\r\nMetz, and of Infantry and Cavalry at St. Cyr, of which a pretty full\r\naccount will be given, the following Public Services are supplied by the\r\nPolytechnic School.\r\n\r\n  GUNPOWDER AND SALTPETRE.--(_Poudres et Salpêtres._)\r\n\r\n  In France the manufacture of gunpowder is solely in the hands of the\r\nGovernment. The pupils of the Polytechnic who enter the gunpowder and\r\nsaltpetre service, are sent in succession to different powder-mills and\r\nsaltpetre refineries, so as to gain a thorough acquaintance with all the\r\ndetails of the manufacture.\r\n\r\n  On first entering the service they are named _élèves des poudres_.\r\nThey afterwards rise successively to the rank of assistant-commissary,\r\ncommissary of the third, of the second, and of the first class.\r\n\r\n  NAVY.--(_Marine._)\r\n\r\n  A small number of the pupils of the Polytechnic enter the Navy. They\r\nreceive the rank of _élève de première classe_, from the date of their\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\n  They are sent to the ports to serve afloat. After two years’ service\r\nthey may be promoted to the rank of _enseigne de vaisseau_, on passing\r\nthe necessary examinations, on the same terms precisely as the _élèves\r\nde premiere classe_ of the Naval School.\r\n\r\n  MARINE ARTILLERY.--(_Artillerie de la Marine._)\r\n\r\n  The French marine artillery differs from the English corps of the same\r\nname, in not serving afloat. Its duties are confined to the ports and to\r\nthe colonies. It is governed by the same rules and ordinances as the\r\nartillery of the army.\r\n\r\n  The foundries of La Villeneuve, Rochefort, Ruelle, Névers, and Saint\r\nGervais are under its direction.\r\n\r\n  The officers of the marine artillery are liable to be sent on board\r\nship to study naval gunnery, so as to be in a position to report upon\r\nalterations or improvements in this science.\r\n\r\n  NAVAL ARCHITECTS.--(_Génie Maritime._)\r\n\r\n  The naval architects are charged with the construction and repair of\r\nvessels of war, and with the manufacture of all the machinery required\r\nin the ports and dockyards. The factories of Indret and La Chaussade are\r\nunder their direction.\r\n\r\n  The pupils of the Polytechnic enter the corps of naval architects with\r\nthe rank of _élève du Génie Maritime_. They are sent to the School of\r\nApplication of Naval Architects at L’Orient. After two years’\r\ninstruction they undergo an examination, and, if successful, they are\r\npromoted to the rank of sub-architect of the third class, so far as\r\nvacancies admit. They may be advanced to the second class after a\r\nservice of two years.\r\n\r\n  HYDROGRAPHERS.--(_Ingénieurs Hydrographes._)\r\n\r\n  The hydrographers are stationed at Paris. They are sent to the coast\r\nto make surveys, and the time so spent reckons as a campaign in\r\ndetermining their pension. On their return to Paris they are employed in\r\nthe construction of maps and charts.\r\n\r\n  The hydrographers have the same rank and advantage as the naval\r\narchitects.\r\n\r\n  On leaving the Polytechnic, the pupils enter the corps of\r\nhydrographers with the rank of _élève hydrographe_. After two years’\r\nservice, and one season employed on the coast, they become\r\nsub-hydrographers without further examination.\r\n\r\n  ROADS AND BRIDGES.--GOVERNMENT CIVIL ENGINEERS.--(_Fonts et\r\nChaussées._)\r\n\r\n  The Polytechnic furnishes exclusively the pupils for the Government\r\nCivil Engineer Corps. On leaving the Polytechnic, the pupils enter the\r\nSchool of Application in Paris. The course of instruction here extends\r\nover a period of three years. It commences each year on the first of\r\nNovember, and lasts till the 1st of April. After the final examination,\r\nthe pupils are arranged according to the results of the examination and\r\nthe amount of work performed.\r\n\r\n  The pupils enter the college with the rank of _élève de troisième\r\nclasse_. They rise successively to the second and to the first class, on\r\nmaking the requisite progress in their studies.\r\n\r\n  From the 1st of May to the 1st of November the _élèves_ of the second\r\nand the third class are sent on duty into the provinces. The _élèves_ of\r\nthe first class who have completed their three years’ course of\r\ninstruction, are employed in the duties of ordinary engineers, or are\r\ndetached on special missions. In about three years after quitting the\r\ncollege, they may be appointed ordinary engineers of the second class.\r\n\r\n  The engineers of the _Ponts et Chaussées_ prepare the projects and\r\nplans, and direct the execution of the works for the construction,\r\npreservation, and repair of high roads, and of the bridges and other\r\nstructures connected with these roads, with navigable rivers, canals,\r\nseaports, lighthouses, &c. They are charged with the superintendence of\r\nrailways, of works for draining marshes, and operations affecting\r\nwater-courses; they report upon applications to erect factories driven\r\nby water. Under certain circumstances, they share with the Mining\r\nEngineers the duty of inspecting steam-engines.\r\n\r\n  Permission is not unfrequently granted to the engineers of the _Ponts\r\net Chaussées_ to accept private employment. They receive leave of\r\nabsence for a certain time, retaining their rank and place in their\r\ncorps, but without pay.\r\n\r\n  MINING ENGINEERS.--(_Mines._)\r\n\r\n  The Mining School of Application is organized almost exactly on the\r\nsame plan as that of the _Ponts et Chaussées_: like the latter, it is in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n  The course of instruction, which lasts three years, consists of\r\nlectures, drawing, chemical manipulation and analysis, visits to\r\nmanufactories, geological excursions, and the preparation of projects\r\nfor mines and machines. Journeys are made by the pupils, during the\r\nsecond half of the last two years of the course, into the mineral\r\ndistricts of France or foreign countries for the purpose of studying the\r\npractical details of mining. These journeys last one hundred days at\r\nleast. The pupils are required to examine carefully the railroads and\r\nthe geological features of the countries they pass through, and to keep\r\na journal of facts and observations. In the final examination, marks are\r\ngiven for every part of their work.\r\n\r\n  The mining engineers, when stationed in the departments, are charged\r\nto see that the laws and ordinances relating to mines, quarries, and\r\nfactories are properly observed, and to encourage, either directly or by\r\ntheir advice, the extension of all branches of industry connected with\r\nthe extraction and treatment of minerals.\r\n\r\n  One of their principal duties is the superintendence of mines and\r\nquarries, in the three-fold regard of safety of the workmen,\r\npreservation of the soil, and economical extraction of the minerals.\r\n\r\n  They exercise a special control over all machines designed for the\r\nproduction of steam, and over railways, as far as regards the metal and\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\n  The instructors in the School of Application in Paris, and in the\r\nSchool of Mines at St. Etienne, are exclusively taken from the members\r\nof the corps.\r\n\r\n  Like the engineers of the _Ponts et Chaussées_, the mining engineers\r\nobtain permission to undertake private employment.\r\n\r\n  TOBACCO DEPARTMENT.--(_Administration des Tabacs._)\r\n\r\n  The pupils who enter the tobacco service, commence, on quitting the\r\nPolytechnic, with the rank of _élève de 2^{e} classe_. They study, in\r\nthe manufactory at Paris, chemistry, physics, and mechanics, as applied\r\nto the preparation of tobacco. They make themselves acquainted at the\r\nsame time with the details of the manufacture and with the accounts and\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\n  They are generally promoted to the rank of _élevè de 1^{re} classe_ in\r\ntwo years. They rise afterwards successively to the rank of\r\nsub-inspector, inspector, and director.\r\n\r\n  After completing their instruction at the manufactory of Paris, the\r\n_élevès_ are sent to tobacco manufactories in other parts of France.\r\n\r\n  Promotion in the tobacco service does not follow altogether by\r\nseniority. Knowledge of the manufacture and attention to their duties\r\nare much considered, as the interests of the treasury are involved in\r\nthe good management of the service.\r\n\r\n  TELEGRAPHS.--(_Lignes Telégraphiques._)\r\n\r\n  On entering the telegraphic service the pupils of the Polytechnic\r\nreceive the rank of _élevè inspecteur_.\r\n\r\n  They pass the first year at the central office. During the six winter\r\nmonths they study, under two professors, the composition of signals, and\r\nthe regulations which insure their correctness and dispatch, the working\r\nof telegraphs and the manner of repairing them, the theory of the mode\r\nof tracing lines and of determining the height of the towers,\r\nelectro-magnetism and its application to the electric telegraph. During\r\nthe summer months they make tours of inspection. They assist in the\r\nexecution of works, and practice leveling and the laying down of lines.\r\n\r\n  At the end of the year the _élevès inspecteurs_ undergo an\r\nexamination, and, if there are vacancies, are appointed provisional\r\ninspectors. After a year in this rank they may be appointed inspectors\r\neither in France or Algeria.\r\n\r\n  Each inspector has charge of a district containing from twelve to\r\nfifteen stations. He is obliged to make a tour of inspection once a\r\nmonth of at least ten days’ duration.\r\n\r\n  After a certain number of years’ service the inspector rises to the\r\nrank of director. Besides their other duties, the directors exercise a\r\ngeneral superintendence over the inspectors.\r\n\r\nPROGRAMMES OF THE PRINCIPAL COURSES OF INSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nOF THE IMPERIAL POLYTECHNIC SCHOOL DURING THE TWO YEARS OF STUDY.\r\n\r\nI.

The care with which these notes are taken is determined\r\nby “marks,” of which account is taken in arranging the pupils in order\r\nof merit.\r\n\r\nThe plans are made according to programmes, of which the conditions are\r\ndifferent for different pupils.

When two warped\r\nsurfaces touch in three points of a common generatrix, they touch each\r\nother in every point of this straight line. Every plane passing through\r\na generatrix touches the surface at one point in this line. The tangent\r\nplane at infinity is the plane-directer to all the paraboloids of\r\n“raccordement.”\r\n\r\nConstruction of the tangent planes and curves of contact of\r\ncircumscribed cones and cylinders. When two infinitely near generatrices\r\nof a warped surface are in the same plane, all the curves of contact of\r\nthe circumscribed cones and cylinders pass through their point of\r\nconcourse.\r\n\r\nThe normals to a warped surface along a generatrix form an isosceles\r\nparaboloid. The name of central point of a generatrix is given to the\r\npoint where it is met by the straight line upon which is measured its\r\nshortest distance from the adjoining generatrix. The locus of these\r\npoints forms the line of striction of the surface. The vertex of the\r\nnormal paraboloid along a generating line is situated at the central\r\npoint. If the point of contact of a plane touching a warped surface\r\nmoves along a generatrix, beginning from the central point, the tangent\r\nof the angle which the tangent plane makes with its primitive position\r\nis proportional to the length described by the point of contact. The\r\ntangent plane at the central point is perpendicular to the tangent plane\r\nat infinity upon the same generatrix.

Lines of Curvature._\r\n\r\nRe-statement without proof of the formula of Euler given in the course\r\nof analysis.\r\n\r\nThere exists an infinity of surfaces of the second degree, which at one\r\nof their vertices osculate any surface whatever at a given point.\r\n\r\nIn the tangent plane, at a point of a surface, there exists a conic\r\nsection, whose diameters are proportional to the square roots of the\r\nradii of curvature of the normal sections to which they are tangents.\r\nThis curve is called the indicatrix. It is defined in form and position,\r\nbut not in magnitude. The normal sections tangential to the axes of the\r\nindicatrix are called the principal sections.\r\n\r\nThe indicatrix an ellipse; convex surfaces; umbilici; line of spherical\r\ncurvatures.\r\n\r\nThe indicatrix a hyperbola; surfaces with opposite curvatures.\r\n\r\nThe assymplotes of the indicatrix have a contact of the second order\r\nwith the surface, and of the first order with the section of the surface\r\nby its tangent plane.\r\n\r\nA ruled surface has contrary curvatures at every point. The second\r\nassymplotes of the indicatrices of all the points of the same generatrix\r\nform a hyperboloid, if the surface has not directer-plane,--a\r\nparaboloid, if it have one.\r\n\r\nCurvature of developable surfaces.\r\n\r\nThere exists upon every surface two systems of orthogonal lines, such\r\nthat every straight line subject to move by gliding over either of them,\r\nand remaining normal to the surface, will engender a developable\r\nsurface. These lines are called lines of curvature.\r\n\r\nThe two lines of curvature which cross at a point, are tangents to the\r\nprincipal sections of the surface at that point.\r\n\r\nRemarks upon the lines of curvature of developable surfaces, and\r\nsurfaces of revolution.\r\n\r\nDetermination of the radii of curvature, and assymplotes of the\r\nindicatrix at a point of a surface of revolution.\r\n\r\nLESSONS 29-30. _Division of Curves of Apparent Contour, and of\r\nSeparation of Light and Shadow into Real and Virtual Parts._\r\n\r\nWhen a cone is circumscribed about a surface, at any point whatever of\r\nthe curve of contact, the tangent to this curve and the generatrix of\r\nthe cone are parallel to two conjugate diameters of the indicatrix.\r\n\r\nSurfaces, as they are considered in shadows, envelop opaque bodies, and\r\nthe curve of contact of a circumscribed cone, only forms a separation of\r\nlight and shadow, for a luminous point at the summit of the cone, when\r\nthe generatrices of this cone are exterior. This line is thus sometimes\r\nreal and sometimes virtual.\r\n\r\nUpon a convex surface, the curve of separation of light and shade is\r\neither all real or all virtual. Upon a surface with contrary curvatures,\r\nthis curve presents generally a succession of real and virtual parts:\r\nthe curve of shadow cast from the surface upon itself presents a like\r\nsuccession. These curves meet tangentially, and the transition from the\r\nreal to the virtual parts upon one and the other, take place at their\r\npoints of contact in such a way that the real part of the curve of\r\nshadow continues the real part of the curve of separation of light and\r\nshade. The circumscribed cones have edges of regression along the\r\ngeneratrices, which correspond to the points of transition.\r\n\r\nThe lines of visible contour present analogous circumstances.\r\n\r\nGeneral method of determining the position of the transition points.\r\nSpecial method for a surface of revolution.\r\n\r\nLESSONS 31-34. _Ruled Helicoidal Surfaces._\r\n\r\nSurface of the thread of the triangular screw; generation,\r\nrepresentation, sections by planes and conical cylinders.\r\n\r\nConstruction of the tangent plane at a given point, or parallel to a\r\ngiven plane.

Introduction of the force of inertia into the\r\npreceding enunciations.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the quantity of motion projected upon an axis or taken\r\nalong the trajectory is equal to the impulsion of the projected\r\nresultant, or to that of the tangential force. The total impulsion of a\r\nforce is got by methods of calculation and of experiment analogous to\r\nthose which relate to _work_.

In decomposing the velocity\r\nof the moving body into a velocity in the plane passing through the axis\r\nof the moments, and a velocity of revolution perpendicular to this\r\nplane, we may replace the moment of the quantity of motion in space by\r\nthe quantity of motion of revolution.

There is a staff of military\r\nofficers in addition to, and quite separate from, the staff employed in\r\nthe duties of instruction. The pupils wear uniform, which, however, is\r\nmore civil than military in appearance. They are formed into four\r\ncompanies which together constitute a battalion; and, although they are\r\nnot actually subject to the penal code of the army, the discipline\r\nmaintained and the punishments inflicted are entirety military in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe military establishment remains exactly as it was in 1856, and\r\nconsists of:\r\n\r\nThe Commandant, a General Officer, usually of the Artillery or the\r\nEngineers, at present a General of Artillery.\r\n\r\nA Second Commandant, a colonel or lieutenant-colonel, chosen from among\r\nthe former pupils of the school; at present a colonel of Engineers.\r\n\r\nThree captains of Artillery and three captains of Engineers, as\r\ninspectors of studies, chosen also from former pupils of the school.\r\n\r\nSix adjutants (_adjudants_), non-commissioned officers, usually such as\r\nhave been recommended for promotion.\r\n\r\nSlight changes have been made in the civil establishment; it now\r\nconsists of:--\r\n\r\n1. A Director of Studies, at present a colonel of Engineers.\r\n\r\n2. Seventeen professors,[12] (two additional professors for history)\r\nseventeen _Répétiteurs_ and assistant _Répétiteurs_, and five drawing\r\nmasters. Of the 17 professors, two are at present officers of Engineers,\r\nand one an officer of Artillery; the remainder are civilians, of whom\r\nthree are members of the Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: In 1856 there were only 15 professors; there are now\r\n    two additional professors for history, the study of which has been\r\n    recently introduced at the school.]\r\n\r\n3. Five examiners for admission, and five for conducting the\r\nexaminations at the school. All of these at present are civilians.\r\n\r\n4. An administrative staff consisting of a treasurer, librarian, &c.;\r\nand a medical staff.\r\n\r\nThe general control or supervision of the school is vested, under the\r\nWar Department, in four great boards or councils, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. A Board of Administration, composed of the Commandant, the Second\r\nCommandant, the Director of Studies, two professors, two captains of the\r\nmilitary staff, and two members of the administrative staff. This board\r\nhas the superintendence of all the financial business, and all the\r\nminutiæ of the internal administration of the school.\r\n\r\n2. A Board of Discipline, consisting of the Second Commandant, the\r\nDirector of Studies, three captains of the Military Staff, and one major\r\nof the army, selected from former pupils of the school.[13] The duty of\r\nthis board is to decide upon cases of misconduct.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: Formerly two professors of the school were also\r\n    members of the Council of Discipline, but the professors have now\r\n    no voice in matters of discipline.]\r\n\r\n3. A Board of Instruction, whose members are, the Commandant, the Second\r\nCommandant, the Director of Studies, the Examiners of Students, the\r\nProfessors, and two captains of the Military Staff; and whose chief duty\r\nis to make recommendations relating to ameliorations in the studies and\r\nthe programmes of admission and of instruction in the school to--\r\n\r\n4. A Board of Improvement (_Conseil de Perfectionnement_), charged with\r\nthe general control of the studies, and formed of:--\r\n\r\n  The Commandant, president,\r\n  The Second Commandant,\r\n  The Director of Studies,\r\n  Two delegates from the Naval Department,\r\n  Two delegates from the Department of Public Works,\r\n  One delegate from the Home or Finance Department,\r\n  Three delegates from the War Department,\r\n  Two members of the Academy of Sciences,\r\n  Two examiners of students,\r\n  Three professors of the school.\r\n\r\nThe delegates from the public departments are appointed by the\r\nrespective ministers; the members of the Academy, the examiners, and the\r\nprofessors are selected by the Minister of War. The real management of\r\nthe school, so far as the course of instruction is concerned, is in the\r\nhands of the _Conseil de Perfectionnement_; it will be seen that of the\r\n18 members composing it more than half are entirely independent of the\r\nschool, and are men of eminence in the various public services for which\r\nthe instruction at the Polytechnic is preparatory. One of the chief\r\nduties of the Council is to see that the studies form a good preparation\r\nfor those of the more special schools (_Ecoles d’ Application_) for the\r\ncivil and military services; and the eminent character of its members\r\ngives great weight to the recommendations they make to the Minister of\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nThe annual expenses of the school, as extracted from the Budget for\r\n1869, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                                 Francs.\r\n  Pay of staff, professors, &c.,                                 331,850\r\n  Instruction, maintenance, examination of candidates,\r\n      clothing, books, &c.,                                      321,073\r\n                                                       Francs.\r\n  Outfits for 30 new pupils at 600 francs each          18,000\r\n  Allowances (_premières mises_) to 25\r\n      exhibitioners on admission to the military\r\n      services at 750 fr. each                          18,750\r\n                                                        ------    36,750\r\n  Maintenance and repair of buildings,                            30,000\r\n                                                                 -------\r\n  Total sum charged in the schools estimate,                     719,673\r\n  Add regimental pay of 28 officers and non-commissioned\r\n      officers employed at the school,                            85,515\r\n                                                                 -------\r\n  Total expenditure                                              805,188\r\n  Deduct repayments from pupils,                                 237,000\r\n                                                                 -------\r\n  Cost to the State,                                             568,188\r\n\r\n  Or about 22,720_l._\r\n\r\nThe chief changes that have been made in regard to the course of\r\ninstruction since 1856, may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The more elementary portions of chemistry and physics which are\r\nrequired in the entrance examination, but which were formerly repeated\r\nat the school, have been omitted. The course of instruction in these\r\nsubjects is now confined to the more advanced portions which do not\r\nenter into the entrance examination.\r\n\r\n2. The mathematical courses have in some points been slightly curtailed,\r\nand the number of lectures in French literature and German have been\r\ndiminished. By the modifications thus made in the programmes, it has\r\nbeen found possible to shorten the whole course of study and to increase\r\nthe length of the vacations.\r\n\r\n3. The subject of “Military Art,” which formerly entered into the final\r\nexamination is no longer taken into consideration in determining the\r\norder of merit of the pupils. In this respect the course of instruction\r\nmay be said to have even less of a military character than formerly.\r\nTopographical drawing is the single military subject which has any\r\ninfluence on the final classification of the pupils, and this only to a\r\nvery slight extent.\r\n\r\n4. History has been introduced as a subject of instruction. This change\r\nwas made in 1862. The course comprises general history, both ancient and\r\nmodern, but more especially the history of France in modern times. The\r\nintroduction of this subject appears to have arisen partly from a\r\nfeeling that an acquaintance with history was a necessary element of a\r\nliberal education, and partly from a wish to meet, to some extent, an\r\nobjection often made to the Polytechnic course of instruction, that it\r\nwas too deficient in studies of a literary character. History, however,\r\nlike military art, is evidently still regarded as a subject of only\r\nsecondary importance and has no influence on the final classification.\r\n\r\n5. A diminution has been made in the number of examinations during the\r\ncourse, by the suppression of one of the half-yearly examinations by the\r\nprofessors (_interrogations générales_, as distinct from the\r\n_interrogations particulières_) in each year. Further reference will be\r\nmade to this point when speaking of the examinations at the school.\r\n\r\n6. The importance of written exercises in determining the respective\r\nmerits of the pupils has been decreased, apparently from the difficulty\r\nof establishing a security that such compositions were the unaided work\r\nof the individual.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the present course of instruction during the\r\ntwo years, and the alterations which have been made in the number of\r\nlectures in each subject since 1856:--\r\n\r\n  _Subject._--_First Year’s Course._       _Lectures in_--1868. 1856.\r\n\r\n  Analysis {Differential calculus,                          25    28\r\n           {Integral calculus,                              18    20\r\n  Descriptive geometry and geometrical drawing,             32    38\r\n  Mechanics and machinery,                                  40    40\r\n  Physics, comprising heat and electricity,                 30    34\r\n  Chemistry:--The metals,                                   30    38\r\n  Astronomy and geodesy,                                    30    35\r\n  French composition and literature,                        25    30\r\n  History,                                                  25     0*\r\n  German,                                                   25    30\r\n  Figure and landscape drawing,                             48    50\r\n\r\n   _Second Year’s Course._\r\n\r\n  Analysis:--Integral calculus,                             32    32\r\n  Stereotomy:--Geometrical drawing of constructions\r\n      in timber and masonry,                                28    32\r\n  Mechanics:--Dynamics, hydrostatics, and machinery,        40    42\r\n  Physics:--Acoustics, optics, and heat,                    30    36\r\n  Chemistry:--Continuation of the metals and organic\r\n      chemistry,                                            30    38\r\n  Architecture and buildings, construction of roads,\r\n      canals, and railways,                                 40    40\r\n  French composition and literature,                        25    30\r\n  History,                                                  25     0*\r\n  German,                                                   25    30\r\n  Military art,                                             20    20\r\n  Topography,                                                2    10\r\n  Figure and landscape drawing,                             48    48\r\n\r\n  [* Introduced in 1862.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with several of the courses, such as descriptive geometry,\r\nstereotomy, machinery, and architecture, much drawing is done by the\r\npupils; hand sketches are taken of the diagrams shown in the\r\nlecture-room, and finished drawings are afterwards executed in the\r\n_salles d’étude_. In addition to this, 30 attendances of two or three\r\nhours each, distributed over the two years, are especially devoted to\r\ndrawing more elaborate plans and elevations of architectural\r\nconstructions and machinery. The practical applications of the\r\ntheoretical instruction are limited to manipulations in the laboratory\r\nin connection with the course of lectures on chemistry and physics.\r\nTowards the close of the second year the pupils are also taken to visit\r\nsome of the large manufacturing establishments in Paris, in order to\r\ngain a practical acquaintance with machinery.\r\n\r\nAll the subjects taught at the school are obligatory, but history and\r\nmilitary art, as already stated, have no influence in determining the\r\norder of merit of the pupils in the final result.\r\n\r\nThe only instruction in practical military exercises, which is\r\ncompulsory upon all, is that in drill. The pupils are exercised under\r\narms in company drill, and are also occasionally drilled as a battalion;\r\nbut very little importance is attached to this point--the only really\r\nmilitary portion of their training. Drill goes on only for about three\r\nmonths in each year during the spring and summer, and even during this\r\nbrief period only takes place about twice a week. By the regulations of\r\nthe school the pupils should be exercised in musketry practice, but\r\nalthough they are armed with the Chassepot rifle this regulation is\r\nnever carried out. Instruction is given in fencing and gymnastics, but\r\nattendance at both is voluntary, and scarcely more than half the pupils\r\ntake advantage of it. Neither riding nor swimming are taught at the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe school year commences about the 1st of November, and terminates\r\nabout the first of August. Some seven months of the year are given up to\r\nlectures and the ordinary routine of study; about two months are\r\noccupied with the annual examinations and private preparation for them;\r\nthe remaining three months--August, September, and October--are the\r\nvacation. In addition to this long vacation, from eight to twelve days\r\nare allowed after the periodical examination, which takes place near the\r\nend of February, at the close of the first portion of each year’s study.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity in the arrangements of the school is that the subjects\r\nof each year’s course are not all studied simultaneously. The lectures\r\nin the main subjects of instruction--those which, as a rule, present the\r\nmost difficulty--are divided into courses which continue only during a\r\ncertain portion of each year. Thus in the junior division, analysis and\r\ndescriptive geometry are the mathematical subjects studied during the\r\nfirst three months, or three months and a half. The course in them is\r\nthen concluded; an examination by the professors (_interrogation\r\ngénérale_) is held in these subjects, and they are laid aside for the\r\nremainder of the year, though they enter into the examination at the\r\nclose of the year. Their place is then taken by a course of lectures in\r\nmechanics and geodesy. Similarly in the second year, analysis and\r\nmechanics are the subjects of the first course of lectures, at the\r\ntermination of which there is an examination; and for the remainder of\r\nthe year no further lectures in them are given, stereotomy and military\r\nart taking their place.\r\n\r\nThe subjects involving as a rule less difficulty--such as history,\r\nFrench literature, German, and drawing--are spread over the whole year,\r\nforming generally the evenings’ occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPECIAL MILITARY SCHOOLS OF FRANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL FOR ARTILLERY AND ENGINEERS AT METZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION,\r\n\r\nThe first French Artillery School was founded in the time of Louis XIV.\r\n(in 1679) at Douai. It had but a short existence: and it was only in\r\n1720 (under the Regency,) when the Royal Regiment of Artillery received\r\na new organization, that schools of theory were permanently founded in\r\neach of the seven towns where there were garrisons of artillery. But no\r\nacademy properly so called was established before that founded by\r\nD’Argenson at La Fère, in 1756, with a staff of two professors of\r\nmathematics, and two of drawing. This was transferred to Bapaume, near\r\nthe Flemish frontier, in 1766, re-transferred to La Fère, and\r\nsuppressed, among other schools, at the beginning of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nOf early Engineer Schools there was only one, the very distinguished\r\nSchool of Mézières, near the northern frontier. This was founded in\r\n1749, also under the ministry of D’Argenson; Monge was a professor\r\nthere; and it had a very high reputation down to its suppression in the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nWhen the wars of the Revolution broke out, Provisional Schools for\r\ngiving a brief course of rapid instruction was established at Metz for\r\nthe engineers, and at Chalons-sur-Marne for the artillery. These had to\r\nsupply, at a great disadvantage, the officers needed for the protection\r\nof the invaded frontier.\r\n\r\nIt was intended originally that the Polytechnic, established in 1794,\r\nshould send engineers direct to the army; but it was quickly found to be\r\na better plan to allow the pupils destined for this service first to\r\nspend some little time at Metz; which thus, in October, 1795, became a\r\nSchool of Application for Engineers. The artillery pupils in like manner\r\nwent to Châlons. This separate system of two Schools of Application\r\ncontinued till 1802, when the establishment at Châlons was united with\r\nthat of Metz, and Metz became what it has since continued to be, the\r\nseat of the United School of Application for the two services. The\r\nPolytechnic students who select the _Artillerie de terre_, _Artillerie\r\nde mer_, or the _Génie militaire_, enter here to receive the special and\r\nprofessional instruction deemed requisite to fit them for actual\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nThe students quitting the Polytechnic in the manner described in the\r\naccount of that school, at the average age of twenty-one, enter the\r\nSchool of Application, with the provisional rank, the uniform, and the\r\npay of sub-lieutenants (_sous-lieutenants_.) The ordinary term of\r\nresidence is two years. Under special circumstances this may be\r\nshortened; and in case of illness or want of application individual\r\nstudents are occasionally retained for a third year. Each new body of\r\nstudents, each _admission_ or _promotion_, is classified at the end of\r\nthe first year, and the students composing it are arranged in order of\r\nmerit in accordance with the reports of the professors, but without an\r\nexamination; at the close of the second year they pass a final\r\nexamination before the Board of Officers, and are definitively placed in\r\nthe corps they have chosen, the artillery or engineers, according to the\r\norder of merit. They are allowed to count, as regards retirement from\r\nthe service and towards military decorations, four year’s service on\r\naccount of the two years passed at the Polytechnic School, and of the\r\ntime passed in preparing for admission to it, reckoning from the day of\r\ntheir admission to the School of Application.\r\n\r\nMetz is a fortified place on the Prussian frontier, the seat of war at\r\nthe time of the school’s first foundation; it is on the line of railway\r\nto Mannheim, about thirty miles from the point where this branch\r\ndiverges from the main line to Strasburg. The Moselle flows through the\r\ntown, and is employed, with its little affluent the Seille, in the\r\nmilitary defenses. The garrison numbers 10,000 men; there is an Arsenal,\r\na school of Pyrotechny for the manufacture of rockets, two Regimental\r\nSchools, one of Artillery and the other of Engineers. The School of\r\nApplication occupies buildings erected on the site, and partly the\r\noriginal buildings themselves, of a suppressed Benedictine monastery.\r\nThree sides of the cloistered monastic quadrangle are devoted to the\r\noffices, lecture-rooms, galleries and halls of study. A fourth, formerly\r\nthe ancient church, is converted into a _salle des manœuvres_. There is\r\nan adjoining residence for the commandant; and a separate modern\r\nbuilding, four stories in height, affords lodging to the young men.\r\n\r\nThe _salle des manœuvres_ is a large area under a lofty roof, rising to\r\nthe whole height of the buildings of the quadrangle; it contains\r\nartillery of various descriptions, mortars, field and siege guns placed\r\nas in a battery, and is amply large enough to allow cannon to be moved\r\nand exercises performed when the state of the weather may make it\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nThe amphitheaters or lecture rooms, much on the same system as those at\r\nthe Polytechnic, are two in number, one for each of the two divisions.\r\nOfficers of the artillery and engineers who are in garrison, are\r\nentitled, if they please, to attend the lectures, and other officers\r\nalso may be admitted by permission.\r\n\r\nThe galleries, partly on the ground floor, partly on the first floor,\r\ncontain very good collections of models of artillery, ancient and\r\nmodern, of sets of small arms, of tools, of locks, barrels and other\r\nportions of muskets in various stages of the process of their\r\nmanufacture, of specimens of carpentry and roofing, of minerals, of\r\nmodels of fortifications, bridges, coffer-dams, locks, &c.\r\n\r\nThe library on the first floor has an adjoining reading room; and near\r\nit is the examination room, of which further mention will be made. The\r\nthree halls of study (_salles d’étude_) on the first floor are on a\r\ndifferent plan from those of the Polytechnic, each one being large\r\nenough to accommodate a whole division (seventy students.) Three rooms\r\nare also provided for the professors to prepare their lectures in.\r\n\r\nThe barracks, on the opposite side of the open space used for drill and\r\nexercises, form a lofty and handsome building, entered by separate\r\nstaircases, the ground-floor rooms of each being assigned to a servant,\r\nwho undertakes to provide attendance for all the young men lodging in\r\nthe rooms above. The rooms are comfortable, mostly double-bedded, the\r\nbedroom serving also as a sitting room, and a small adjoining closet\r\nbeing used for washing, &c. Twenty or twenty-two appear to be thus\r\naccommodated on each staircase; there are lodgings altogether for one\r\nhundred and forty-five. A certain number of the senior sub-lieutenants\r\nwould, probably, on the arrival of the new cadets from the Polytechnic,\r\nbe removed to lodge in the town.\r\n\r\nThere is a riding-school adjoining the court; stables, for thirty-three\r\nhorses, which are kept for the use of the pupils, and lodgings for the\r\nattendants are provided in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe mere description of the buildings shows at once that the system is\r\ndifferent in many respects from that of the Polytechnic. Young men of\r\ntwenty-one and twenty-two years of age, already holding provisional\r\ncommissions in the service, receiving the pay and wearing the uniform of\r\nsub-lieutenants, are naturally allowed much greater freedom of action.\r\nThey live, and partly also study, not in the halls of study, but in\r\ntheir own rooms; they take their meals in the town, where they frequent\r\nthe _cafés_ and _restaurants_ of their choice. The _rappel_ summons them\r\nevery morning to rise and attend a roll-call at half-past five or six;\r\nmilitary exercises, riding, or interrogations, similar to the\r\n_interrogations particulières_, require the presence of a portion of the\r\nnumber, but the rest are free to return to their rooms. At ten they have\r\nto attend either the day’s lecture, followed by employment in the halls\r\nof study, till four o’clock P.M., or they proceed at once to the halls\r\nof study, and set to work on the drawings, designs, projects, &c., which\r\nare described hereafter in the account of the studies. From four to\r\nhalf-past five P.M.; drill, exercises, and riding occupy a portion of\r\nthe number, probably those who were not called for in the morning. After\r\nhalf-past five they are left to themselves.\r\n\r\nThis ordinary routine of studies is interrupted in the summer months by\r\nthe occurrence of expeditions for making surveys, and for measuring and\r\nsketching machines in manufactories. The young men are sent, two\r\ntogether, to survey (_lever à boussole_;) singly for the reconnaissance\r\nsketch _(lever à vue _;) and generally, a certain number are distributed\r\nabout a district not too large for an officer to make his round in it,\r\nand see each day that all are at work. The railways afford considerable\r\nfacilities; the expeditions never occupy more than ten days at a time,\r\nbut they may be extended as far as Strasburg.\r\n\r\nThere are no _répétiteurs_ in the school; but the system of\r\n_interrogations particulières_ is carried on; and an examination by the\r\nprofessor and an assistant professor takes place after, about, every\r\neight or ten lectures.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STAFF AND GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Staff of the Institution consists of--\r\n\r\n  1 General Officer, at present a General of Brigade of Artillery,\r\n      as Commandant.\r\n  1 Colonel or Lieutenant-Colonel, Second in Command and Director\r\n      of Studies, at present a Lieutenant-Colonel of Engineers.\r\n  1 Major of Artillery.\r\n  1 Major of Engineers.\r\n  5 Captains of Artillery.\r\n  8 Captains of Engineers.\r\n  1 Surgeon (_Médecin-Major_.)\r\n\r\nThe Commandant is taken alternately from the Artillery and Engineers,\r\nand the command lasts for five years only.\r\n\r\nThe Second in Command is always chosen from that arm of the service\r\nwhich does not supply the Commandant.\r\n\r\nThe inferior officers of each rank are taken in equal numbers from the\r\ntwo arms.\r\n\r\nThe Staff of Instructors is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1 Professor of Artillery, at present a Captain of Artillery.\r\n  1 Assistant     ditto     also a Captain of Artillery.\r\n  1 Professor of Military Art, charged also with the Course\r\n      of Military Legislation and Administration\r\n      (a Captain of Engineers.)\r\n  1 Professor of Permanent Fortification and of the Attack\r\n      and Defense of places (a Captain of Engineers.)\r\n  1 Assistant    ditto     ditto  (a Captain of Engineers.)\r\n  1 Professor of the Course of Topography and Geodesy\r\n     (a Captain of Engineers.)\r\n  1 Professor of Sciences applied to the Military Arts.\r\n  1 Professor of Mechanics applied to Machines (a Captain of Artillery.)\r\n  1 Professor of the Course of Construction (a Captain of Engineers.)\r\n  1 Assistant            ditto.\r\n  1 Professor of the German language (a civilian.)\r\n  1 Professor of Veterinary Art and Riding (a Captain of Artillery.)\r\n  1 Assistant      ditto  (a civilian.)\r\n  1 Drawing Master, Chief of the Drawing Department (a civilian.)\r\n\r\nIn all, nine Professors, four Assistant Professors, and one Drawing\r\nMaster.\r\n\r\nThe School employs in addition an administrative staff, consisting of--\r\n\r\n  A Treasurer, } both of whom must have been Officers in the\r\n  A Librarian, }   Artillery or Engineers.\r\n  A Principal Clerk.\r\n  An Assistant Librarian.\r\n  Two Storekeepers, intrusted with the _materiel_ belonging to\r\n    the two arms.\r\n  One skilled Mechanic.\r\n  One skilled Lithographer.\r\n  One Fencing Master.\r\n\r\nClerks and draughtsmen are provided as required.\r\n\r\nThe school is under the general superintendence of two hoards or\r\ncouncils, the Superior Council and the Administrative Council.\r\n\r\nThe Superior Council consists of the General Commandant, as President,\r\nthe Second in Command, the Director of Studies, as Vice-President; the\r\nMajor of Artillery, and the Major of Engineers, as permanent members;\r\ntwo Captains of the Establishment, one of each arm; two Military\r\nProfessors, one of each arm; and one Captain of the Establishment; these\r\nfive last being all removable at the General Inspections.\r\n\r\nThe Superior Council has the duty of drawing up the programme of the\r\nstudies of the year, of suggesting changes in the regulations relating\r\nboth to studies and discipline, all subject to the approval of the\r\nMinister of War; of preparing at the end of the year the classified list\r\nof the students, drawn up according to their conduct and progress in\r\ntheir studies, and of pointing out to the Jury of Examiners any students\r\nwho should go again through the courses of the year, and stay in\r\nconsequence an additional year at the school.\r\n\r\nWhen questions relating to the instruction are brought before the\r\nSuperior Council, the whole body of military professors attend and take\r\npart in the proceedings, and the Council is thus said to be constituted\r\nas a Board or Council of Instruction. Improvements are here suggested,\r\nand are subsequently submitted to the Jury of Examiners, and to the\r\nMinister of War; the value to be attached, in the system of marks or\r\ncredits, to each particular course of study is determined; a statement\r\nis drawn up showing what printed works, models, &c., are wanted. The\r\nbudget itself, to be submitted to the Minister of War, is finally drawn\r\nup by the Superior Council in its ordinary sittings.\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Council, composed of the Second in Command as\r\nPresident, the two Majors of Artillery and of Engineers, one Captain and\r\none Military Professor, and the Treasurer as Secretary without the right\r\nof voting, takes cognizance of all the financial and other business\r\nmatters of the school.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECTS AND METHOD OF STUDY.\r\n\r\nThe studies at Metz consist of topography and geodesy, including\r\nmilitary drawing and surveying under special circumstances; field\r\nfortification, military art and legislation, permanent fortification,\r\nand the attack and defense of fortified places, accompanied by a sham\r\nsiege, without, however, executing the details practically on the\r\nground; architecture, as applicable to military buildings and\r\nfortifications; the theory and practice of construction, and artillery.\r\nThe programmes of these studies are inserted at length in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe instruction is given principally (as at the Polytechnic) by means of\r\na series of lectures, and the knowledge which the students have acquired\r\nis first directly tested by requiring them to execute various kinds of\r\nsurveys of ground, either with or without the use of instruments; to\r\nprepare drawings of buildings, workshops, and machines in full detail\r\n(plan, elevation, and sections) from the measurements they have recorded\r\nin their note-books or on their sketches, and to accompany such drawings\r\nwith descriptive memoirs of all particulars and calculations that may be\r\nnecessary to exhibit their purpose or efficiency; to draw up projects\r\nand lay out works of field and permanent fortification, or of those of\r\nattack or defense of a particular place on certain given data, or\r\naccording to the nature of the ground; to design a military building,\r\nbridge, machine, or piece of ordnance, accompanied by estimates and\r\ndescriptive memoirs, showing in what manner the instructions and\r\nconditions under which it was drawn up have been complied with; and to\r\nprepare a project for the amelioration of the works of defense of a\r\nspecified portion of a fortified place known to be defective in some\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nThe instruction during the first year’s residence is common to the two\r\narms; and the time is appropriated in the following manner, namely:--\r\n\r\n                                           Days.\r\n  Military art and legislation,             33\r\n  Topography and geodesy,                   47\r\n  Field fortification,                      39\r\n  Permanent fortification,                  88\r\n  Theory and practice of construction,      77\r\n                                           ---\r\n                                Total,     284\r\n\r\nThe _sous-lieutenants_ who complete their first year’s work are allowed\r\nnearly a month’s vacation during November.\r\n\r\nThe instruction given to the Artillery and Engineers during the second\r\nyear’s residence is not entirely the same, as will be seen by comparing\r\nthe accompanying table of the year’s study:--\r\n\r\n                                      Artillery. Engineers.\r\n                                        Days.

It\r\nwould appear, however, that very frequently the day’s occupation\r\nconsists simply of work in the halls of study (or occasionally out of\r\nthe school buildings, when the students are sent on some excursion;)\r\nand, accordingly, in giving the account of the studies, a _day_ or day’s\r\nwork will sometimes mean a lecture followed by drawing or other\r\nemployment, sometimes this drawing or other employment without any\r\nlecture preceding. Taking a general average, the proportion appears to\r\nbe about two lectures to five _séances_, _i.e._, sittings without\r\nlectures.\r\n\r\nThe system will be better understood by referring to the accompanying\r\ntables, which are translated from the Project for the Employment of Time\r\nfor the year 1851-2, submitted for the approval of the Minister of War.\r\nThe dates in the first column indicate the days of the commencement of\r\neach particular study. The school year, it should be said, begins on the\r\n1st of December.\r\n\r\nEMPLOYMENT OF TIME FOR THE YEARS 1851-1852.\r\n\r\n  [KEY]\r\n  Att Attendances.\r\n  LbW Lectures before Work.\r\n  TL  Total of Lectures.\r\n\r\n  -----------+------------------------------------------+--------------\r\n  Month and  |  Second Division.                        |  Number of\r\n    Date.    |                                          +----+----+----\r\n             |  First Year’s Instruction.               | Att| LbW| TL\r\n  -----------+------------------------------------------+----+----+----\r\n  December 1 | Lectures on Military Art in              |    |    |\r\n      “    2 |   Topography--Conventional Tints,        |  2 |....|....\r\n      “    4 | Study of Hill Drawing                    |    |    |\r\n             |   (in sepia with contour lines,)         |  2 |....|....\r\n             |              { Plate 1 .. 5}             |    |    |\r\n             |              { Plate 2 .. 5}             |    |    |\r\n      “    6 | Military Art,{ Plate 3 .. 5}             |    |    |\r\n             |              { Plate 4 .. 5}             |    |    |\r\n             |              { Plate 5 .. 9}             | 29 |  4 | 39\r\n  January 12 | Front of Cormontaige                     | 24 |  3 | 13\r\n             |                                          |    |    |\r\n  February 9 | Project of Field Fortification,          |    |    |\r\n             |   { Plate 1.

It takes place\r\nin a room set apart for the purpose, with a small interior room in\r\nconnection with it, into which the members of the board retire to\r\ndeliberate at the end of each student’s examination. The jury assembles\r\neach year at the period fixed by the minister of war.\r\n\r\nThe three examining members conduct the examination of the students in\r\nthree different branches of study; the first more particularly relating\r\nto artillery science, the second to engineering science, and the third\r\nto mechanical science in its connection with the art of war. The whole\r\nof the students who are to leave the school are first examined in such\r\none or other of these branches of study as may be determined on.\r\n\r\nThe student under examination is specially questioned by the examining\r\nofficer in his subject, and occasionally by the president or any other\r\nmember of the board that may wish to do so, for three-quarters of an\r\nhour. As soon as the examination of the student has been concluded, the\r\nboard retire to the adjoining room and compare their notes of the\r\ncredits they have severally awarded to the student under examination,\r\nand they also examine his drawings, sketches, and memoirs relating to\r\nthe subjects on which he has been questioned, and prepared during his\r\ntwo years of residence in the school. They severally note the credits to\r\nwhich they consider him to be entitled for them, and adopt the general\r\nmean.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the examination of the whole of the students in this\r\nparticular study has been finished, the examination in the next branch\r\nis commenced, so that five or six days elapse between the first and\r\nsecond examinations of the same student; and the same interval of time\r\noccurs between the second and third examinations.\r\n\r\nThe credit allotted to each student by the board of examiners\r\nrepresents, on the scale of 0 to 20, the manner in which he has replied\r\nto the questions, or executed the drawings, sketches, memoirs, &c.,\r\nbelonging to each course. The importance attached to each particular\r\nbranch of study is estimated very nearly by the amount of time allowed\r\nfor its execution divided by 20; and the definitive marks which each\r\nstudent obtains for that branch of study is obtained from the products\r\nof the numbers respectively representing the credit for answering, and\r\nthat for the importance of the subjects on which he has been examined.\r\n\r\nThe final classification of the order of merit, in each arm of the\r\nservice, is arranged after a comparison of the total of the marks\r\nobtained by each student. This total is the sum of the definitive marks\r\ngained by each student in the sciences bearing on artillery,\r\nengineering, and mechanics in connection with the art of war, for the\r\ntalent displayed in drawing, sketching, and writing memoirs, and for\r\nskill in practical exercises, as determined by the results of the\r\nexamination conducted by the jury of examiners, added to the marks due\r\nto the previous classification in the school, with the weight or\r\ninfluence equal to one-third of that allowed for the examination by the\r\njury.\r\n\r\nThe co-efficients of influence for the present year are--\r\n\r\n  For those particularly relating to Artillery Science,        39.29\r\n        “          “            “    Engineering Science,      53.75\r\n        “          “            “    Mechanical Science,       43.00\r\n  For talent in drawing, sketching, writing memoirs, &c.,       6.80\r\n  For practical exercises,                                     16.75\r\n  Previous classification in the school,                       45.30\r\n\r\nSo that the examination conducted by the jury of examiners exercises an\r\ninfluence on the position of the students very nearly approaching to\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole amount.\r\n\r\nIt is this final classification which determines their seniority in the\r\nrespective services. We were permitted to be present during the\r\nexamination, which was entirely oral, of two of the _sous-lieutenants_,\r\nbefore the jury of examiners.\r\n\r\nThe questions were replied to with great fluency and readiness, but it\r\nseemed to us that the examination was somewhat limited for the object in\r\nview, viz., that of awarding a credit representing the progress which\r\neach student had made in the particular science on which he had been\r\nquestioned, especially as that credit would have very great weight in\r\ndetermining the candidate’s future position.[14]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: The examination chamber is a small room in the\r\n    school buildings, near the library, ornamented with portraits of\r\n    Vauban, and of D’Argenson, under whose ministry the original\r\n    schools at La Fère and Mézières were founded. At a large table\r\n    under these portraits, and extending across the room, General\r\n    Morin, President, and four officers, members of the jury, were\r\n    seated. The sixth member sat at a small table in front, near the\r\n    blackboard, at which the student stood. The Commandant, the\r\n    Director of Studies, and the other officers of the school were\r\n    seated also in this part of the room.\r\n\r\n    The student who was first examined was questioned partly by the\r\n    examiner, partly by the president, and gave his answers, working\r\n    problems and drawing illustrations on the board as he went on. He\r\n    was asked questions as to the details of the steam-engine, and as\r\n    to the method of casting cannon. The German teacher of the School\r\n    put him on to construe from a German book, and tried him in\r\n    speaking; he succeeded just passably in both. The whole occupied\r\n    about three-quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\n    The second student, after answering similar scientific questions,\r\n    had opportunity given him to show his knowledge, which was\r\n    considerable, of the geology of the neighborhood; and having lived\r\n    in foreign countries, he was able to make a very good display of\r\n    his knowledge of German, Spanish, Italian, and English.\r\n\r\n    After each examination the jury retired into the inner cabinet, by\r\n    a door opening to it from behind their seats.]\r\n\r\nOn quitting the School of Application at Metz, the sub-lieutenants of\r\nartillery and engineers respectively join the regiments, to which they\r\nare then definitely assigned as second lieutenants, and continue to be\r\nemployed in doing duty, and in receiving practical instruction with\r\nthem, until they are promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSEQUENT INSTRUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenants of the artillery are employed on all duties that will\r\ntend to make them efficient artillery officers, and fully acquainted\r\nwith all details connected with the drill, practice, and manœuvres of\r\nthe artillery, and also with the interior economy and discipline of a\r\nregiment of artillery.\r\n\r\nAfter the officers of artillery are promoted to the rank of second\r\ncaptain, but not before, they are detached from their regiments and\r\nsuccessively sent into the various arsenals, cannon foundries, powder\r\nmills, and small arm manufactories, pyrotechnic establishments, and\r\nworkshops, in order that they may become practically acquainted with the\r\nwhole of the processes connected with the manufacture and supply of\r\nartillery, rockets, small arms, powder, material of all kinds, tools,\r\n&c., and also with the construction and repair of the buildings and\r\nfactories required for these purposes. Sometimes they are employed as\r\nassistants in these establishments. The inspectors of the arms of\r\nregiments are selected from among those who have become acquainted with\r\nthe manufacture of small arms.\r\n\r\nWhen promoted to first captains they again rejoin their regiments, so\r\nthat they may not lose the qualifications and knowledge required from a\r\ngood practical artillery officer.\r\n\r\nField-officers of artillery are employed as superintendents and\r\ndirectors, and captains as sub-directors, of the important works\r\nintrusted to their arm.\r\n\r\nIn time of war, the officers of artillery have the construction of their\r\nown batteries, and the direction of the ordnance in battles and sieges,\r\ntogether with the formation of movable bridges and passages by boats.\r\n\r\nIt must be noticed, in contradistinction to the practice which prevails\r\nin England, that the artillery and engineer services manufacture their\r\nown tools.\r\n\r\nThe young engineer officers are employed with the men of their\r\nregiments, and with them pass through courses of practical instruction\r\nin the field, in sapping, mining, field fortification, sham-sieges,\r\nbridges, and castrametation. During this practical instruction one of\r\nthe lieutenants belonging to each company is always present, and the\r\ncaptain of the company visits the work once in the course of the day.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the officers of engineers in time of peace are the\r\nconstruction, preservation, and repairs of fortresses and military\r\nbuildings, and the command and instruction of the engineer soldiers.\r\n\r\nIn time of war, the officers of engineers are intrusted with the\r\nconstruction of works of permanent fortification, of the general works\r\nin the attack and defense of fortresses, and the reconnaissance\r\nconnected therewith.\r\n\r\nThey _may_ also be charged--\r\n\r\nWith the construction of such works of field fortifications as the\r\ncommander-in-chief or the generals of division consider necessary; such\r\nas _épaulments_, trenches, redoubts, forts, blockhouses, bridgeheads,\r\nintrenched camps, as well as the opening of communications, the\r\nestablishment of bridges resting on fixed supports, and the formation\r\nand destruction of roads.\r\n\r\nAfter the officers of engineers have been promoted to the rank of second\r\ncaptain, and not before, they are mostly employed apart from their\r\nregiments, on the _état major_ of the engineers in fortified towns and\r\nplaces, either in charge of the existing military buildings and\r\nfortifications, or with the duty of carrying on, or assisting to carry\r\non, such new works as are in course of construction from time to time.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that by the law in France one-third of the\r\nofficers of the army is obtained from the military schools; one-third\r\nfrom the non-commissioned officers who have been raised to that grade\r\nfrom the ranks; while the remaining third is placed at the disposal of\r\nthe supreme executive power. As regards the artillery and engineers this\r\nlast third is in actual practice obtained, like the first third part,\r\nfrom the Polytechnic School, so that only one-third of the officers of\r\nthose arms are promoted from among the non-commissioned officers, and\r\nthese seldom rise above the rank of captain. Much attention is, however,\r\npaid to the improvement of the education of these latter officers, and\r\nwe found that _four_ officers of engineers and _one_ officer of\r\nartillery so promoted were, by order of the minister of war, on the\r\nrecommendation of the inspectors-general, passing through the School of\r\nApplication at Metz, the course of instruction for them being modified\r\non their account. And it was confidently expected that a large number of\r\nthose officers who had been promoted in this way during the war would be\r\nordered to the School of Application at Metz.\r\n\r\nWe should not omit to mention that occasional exchanges of service take\r\nplace, during the first year of residence at Metz, among the pupils\r\ndestined for the artillery, and those destined for the engineers.\r\n\r\nThe pay of officers of the artillery and of the engineers is the same.\r\nA small additional allowance is granted to officers of artillery when\r\nmounted.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTILLERY REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThere are ten regimental artillery schools established in places or\r\ntowns that are usually garrisoned by the troops of this arm, and one of\r\nthese schools exists at Metz.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINEER REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers of the engineers appear to be very well taught in their\r\nregimental schools, of which there are three, one for each regiment,\r\nestablished at Metz, Arras, and Montpellier, where the regiments are\r\nusually in garrison. The strength of each regiment is 4,500 men.\r\n\r\nThe instruction given in these schools has for its object to afford, to\r\nits full extent, to the officers, _sous-officiers_, and soldiers of the\r\nengineers, the requisite theoretical and practical knowledge to enable\r\nthem satisfactorily to fulfill the duties of their various ranks, and to\r\nqualify them for promotion to higher rank.\r\n\r\nIt is so regulated that at the end of the first year the men have learnt\r\nthe nature of the service and duties of a soldier; and that at the close\r\nof the second year, the practiced sapper is cognizant of mining, and the\r\npractical miner is acquainted with sapping.\r\n\r\nIn the lowest classes the men begin with learning to read and write;\r\nthis if followed by arithmetic, grammar, writing from dictation, and\r\ncomposition. The next subjects are special mathematics, landscape, plan,\r\ntopographical and architectural drawing. We attended a class in which a\r\ncorporal of sappers was explaining to the mathematical teacher\r\n(a civilian) the theory of the inclined plane, and we saw a large number\r\nof their drawings, topographical and architectural, many of which were\r\nvery well executed.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical instruction is given between the months of November and\r\nMarch, the practical instruction in the field, (already noticed)\r\noccupies the rest of the year. The combined courses are completed in two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATIONS AND PROGRAMMES OF INSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL SCHOOL OF APPLICATION FOR THE ARTILLERY AND ENGINEERS AT METZ.\r\n\r\n(_Abridged._)\r\n\r\nI. POLICE REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe chief Regulations for the Police of the Establishment are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nI. BARRACKS.--The Students are lodged in Barracks in the School, under\r\nthe command of a Captain of the Staff, with the title of Commandant of\r\nthe Quarter. They take their meals, however, out of the Barracks, in the\r\ntown. They are allowed free egress and ingress from and to their\r\nBarracks, from the call at 6 in the morning to 10 at night, excepting\r\nduring the hours devoted to lectures and the studies in the rooms.\r\nDuring these hours they must give special notice o£ their times of going\r\nout and coming in.\r\n\r\nII. ORGANIZATION INTO BRIGADES AND SECTIONS.--Each Division is arranged\r\nin Brigades of thirty Students at the utmost, and each Brigade in two\r\nsections. The Students of Artillery and those of the Engineers\r\nconstitute, as far as possible, separate Brigades. A Captain of the\r\nStaff is attached to each Brigade for its superintendence. The students\r\nin these Brigades and Sections are arranged in the order of merit which\r\nthey held on entrance, and the first Student on the list of each Brigade\r\nand of each section of a Brigade is called its Chief. This arrangement\r\nis preserved at their messes, which are held at the Restaurateurs’, each\r\nsection of fifteen having its own table, and its chief being the head of\r\nthe mess. Private bills or private additions to the mess are forbidden,\r\nthe maximum price for the daily fare being fixed by the Commandant of\r\nthe School.\r\n\r\nIII. CONDUCT OF THE STUDENTS.--All games of chance are forbidden; and\r\nany debts discovered are punished. If a Student continues long without\r\npaying such, he is reported to the Minister of War.\r\n\r\nIV. INSPECTION OF WORK DONE WITHIN THE HOUSE.--No work or drawing may be\r\ndone out of the rooms of study, except in cases of illness.\r\n\r\nAll works to be executed by the Students are considered as service\r\nordered to be done, which must be completed at the hours and within the\r\nperiod fixed in the order of the day. Students who are in arrears of\r\nwork at the end of their first year are required to finish them during\r\nthe time of vacation.\r\n\r\nV. SUPERINTENDENCE OF OUT-OF-DOOR WORK.--After describing facilities\r\nafforded to the Students for working in the country, and stating\r\nminutely the method to be followed, the directions add that “on bringing\r\nback their plans, Students must present their sketches, and all the\r\nnotes taken by them, in their rough state, to the Officer of the Staff\r\nintrusted to inspect them. They can not begin to put their work into\r\nshape till this Officer’s visa has been affixed to the sketches, notes,”\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nVI. VACATION.--There is one vacation at the end of the first year. Any\r\nclass, or any single student, under punishment, may be deprived of this.\r\nAny work to which the Professor gives a mark below 7, must be considered\r\nincomplete, and to be done again. Students are kept up in vacation to\r\nfinish their work; but if it is done within fifteen days, and marked by\r\nthe Professor’s visa, they are allowed to go away for the rest of the\r\nvacation.\r\n\r\nYoung Officers, after their final examination, are subject to all the\r\nRegulations of the School, down to the moment of their leaving the town.\r\n\r\nII. REGULATIONS FOR ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF THE WORK EXECUTED.\r\n\r\nThe time devoted to each of the courses in the School, to the works of\r\nevery kind which belong to it, to the exercises, drill, theoretical\r\ninstructions, &c., is fixed in accordance with programmes approved by\r\nthe Minister of War; and the Table similar to that given at pages\r\n180-181, exhibiting the employment, is each year submitted for his\r\napprobation by the Superior Council of the School.\r\n\r\nEvery kind of work, such as the out-door operations, sketches, drawings,\r\nmemoirs, calculations, interrogations, manipulations, manœuvres, drill,\r\n&c., is valued by the Professor or Officer of the Staff charged with its\r\ndirection, by the product of two numbers, one representing the merit of\r\nits execution, and the other the importance of the work.\r\n\r\nThe numbers representing the merit of the execution or instruction are\r\nregulated by the scale of 0 to 20, as at the Polytechnic School.\r\n\r\nThe co-efficient of importance is found by dividing the number\r\nrepresenting the maximum value allowed for the execution of any work by\r\n20, the maximum credit for merit; and the number representing the\r\nmaximum value, allowed for the execution of any work has reference to\r\nall the circumstances bearing upon its execution. It is regulated by the\r\nnumber of hours appropriated to its execution; and in estimating this\r\nnumber of hours, regard is had, not only to the time occupied in making\r\nthe drawing, but also to that which is necessary for the calculations,\r\nessays, and sketches indispensable to its execution. The lectures are\r\nreckoned at one and a half hours, and the sittings in the Halls of Study\r\nat four and a half hours.\r\n\r\nThe number of hours inserted in the Table giving the distribution of the\r\ntime employed, being insufficient for the composition of the memoirs,\r\nspecifications, estimates, &c., the value given for this kind of work,\r\nof which a great part is performed out of the Halls of Study, is fixed\r\nat twice the number of hours inserted in the Table showing the\r\ndistribution of the time employed.\r\n\r\nThe interrogations are the subject of a special credit, the maximum\r\nbeing equal to the number of hours devoted to the lectures, multiplied\r\nby one and a half hour, the length of each lecture.\r\n\r\nThe credit given for a work performed outside the school is divided into\r\ntwo parts: one, equal to one-third of the total credit, is in the hands\r\nof the Officer charged with the superintendence of the work, who\r\nestimates the zeal and aptitude of the student; the other, equal to\r\ntwo-thirds, is applied by the Professor, and given according to the\r\nmerit of the work.\r\n\r\nThe sum of the credits, given for work of all kinds in a course of\r\nstudy, forms the maximum credit for the course.\r\n\r\nThe method of fixing the credit for the execution of works, according to\r\nthe time devoted to them, is equally applicable to the exercises,\r\npractice, and drill.\r\n\r\nWhen the time granted for the execution of any work has expired, the\r\nDirector of Studies sends this work to the Professor for his\r\nexamination, who establishes the number or credit, showing its\r\nimportance, and returns it to the Director of Studies.\r\n\r\nEvery work which has been finished and examined, is marked by the\r\nProfessor by a number representing its merit, which number may be\r\nfractional.\r\n\r\nThis is multiplied by the number representing its importance, and the\r\nnearest whole number resulting from this product expresses the value of\r\nthe examined work.\r\n\r\nEvery unfinished work receives a provisional value, and is then returned\r\nto the person executing it, and as soon as it has been completed a\r\nsecond evaluation is made, but only two-thirds of the difference between\r\nthe first and second evaluations is added to the first; the same\r\nprinciple is applied to the works which have been valued below seven, or\r\nto those which have been amended or recommenced.\r\n\r\nEvery work which has not been executed by the student is marked 0; but\r\nthe grounds for its non-execution are placed before the Jury of\r\nExamination.\r\n\r\nIn the event of two papers being so similar that it is evident one must\r\nhave been copied from the other, and that it is not possible to decide\r\nwhich has been copied from the other, both are marked 0.\r\n\r\nAnd on the other hand, if it is proved that there was no complicity\r\nbetween the authors of the two papers, the copied paper is the only one\r\ncanceled.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each year’s study, the Council of the School makes a\r\nclassification of the students of the two divisions.\r\n\r\nEach of these classifications is formed of the following elements:--\r\n\r\n1st. Notes of conduct given by the General commanding and the Colonel\r\nSecond in Command.\r\n\r\n2nd. Notes of appreciation given by the General Commanding, and the\r\nColonel Second in Command, and by the Officers of the Staff of the\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\n3rd. Tables of credits given by two Field Officers of the Artillery and\r\nEngineers on the theoretical and practical instruction with which they\r\nare charged.\r\n\r\n4th. Tables of credits given by each Professor for the works of all\r\nkinds, interrogations, &c., of his course.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the first year comprehends all the works, drill,\r\nand practice, executed during the first year, which have been valued, as\r\nwell as the notes of appreciation and of conduct.\r\n\r\nThe number appropriated to these notes at the end of the first year is\r\nequal to the moiety of the total number allowed for the two years of\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the students of the second year presents the\r\nreunion of the works executed by them since their entrance into the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of credits appropriated to all the Officers of the\r\nStaff, as a note of appreciation, is equal to one-sixth of the total of\r\nall the courses taken together.\r\n\r\nThe same number, divided into two equal parts, is assigned to the notes\r\nof appreciation given by the General commanding and the Second in\r\nCommand.\r\n\r\nLastly, the notes of conduct given by the General commanding and the\r\nSecond in Command form one-fiftieth of the total value.\r\n\r\nFor the classification of each division the Director of Studies\r\nabstracts into a Table, for each arm, all the elements which should\r\nenter into this classification. Below the name of each student are\r\ninserted all the credits which belong to him, and the total, reduced in\r\nthe ratio of the maximum 20, is the definitive number of the\r\nclassification of each student.\r\n\r\nThe Director of Studies appends to these Tables a report containing\r\neverything which affords a means of estimating the work, the conduct of\r\neach student, the delays, and the causes, &c. In giving the names of the\r\nstudents whose credits are less than 7, he proposes, conformably with\r\nthe Regulations, the measures that should be taken with regard to them.\r\n\r\nThe Superior Council of the School being assembled, the different Tables\r\nfurnished by the Professors and by the Officers of the Staff, as well as\r\nthose in which they are summed up, are collated, and the list of\r\nclassifications for each division and for each arm is fixed separately,\r\nwith the definitive numbers representing the credits.\r\n\r\nThese classified lists indicate for each arm the new rank of the\r\nStudents, their rank at admission to the School of Application and of\r\npassage to the first division, the sum of the values for the works\r\nexecuted by them, and all the elements which would tend to enable a\r\nproper judgment to be formed of their merits and conduct.\r\n\r\nThe Superior Council adds to it, if there be any necessity for it,\r\nnotes, exposing the grounds which have contributed to the principal\r\nalterations in the relative position of the Student, and points out\r\nthose whose credit is less than 7, as well as those who by their bad\r\nconduct deserve to become the object of exceptional measures.\r\n\r\n_Examination for Leaving._\r\n\r\nEach year the General commanding the School determines by lot, at least\r\none month in advance, the order in which the examinations for the\r\npromotions in the Artillery and Engineers are to take place. The\r\nStudents belonging to the same arm can change among themselves, but\r\neight days after the lots have been drawn the list of the order of\r\nexamination is definitely closed. The General commanding the School\r\nmakes known at the same period the order of the examinations and the\r\ndivision of the subjects between these examinations.\r\n\r\nThe General commanding the School places before the General of Division,\r\nPresident of the Jury of Examination, the following:--\r\n\r\n1st. The division of the subjects between the three examinations.\r\n\r\n2nd. The order of examination of the Arms, and of the students of each\r\nArm.\r\n\r\n3rd. The provisional classification of the students of the first\r\ndivision made by the Superior Council.\r\n\r\n4th. The particular reports relating to each student made by the General\r\ncommanding the School.\r\n\r\n5th. The list of the propositions made by the Superior Council and the\r\nproceedings of the sitting at which it was agreed to.\r\n\r\n6th. The classification of the Students of the second Division.\r\n\r\n7th. Tables of questions established for each course.\r\n\r\n8th. The abstracts of the sittings of the Superior Council held since\r\nthe last examination.\r\n\r\nThe Student Sub-lieutenants are successively examined in all the\r\nbranches composing the theoretical and practical instruction of the\r\nSchool. The theoretical knowledge is grouped in three series, each of\r\nwhich is the object of a particular trial.\r\n\r\nThe drill and practice are executed in the presence of the Jury, who\r\ncause the command to be given to the Sub-lieutenant, in order to satisfy\r\nthemselves of the amount of their instruction, and to assign marks of\r\nmerit to them individually.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the three examinations are divided in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\nFirst. Examination, made by the Field Officer of Artillery in the--\r\n\r\n  Course of Military Art.\r\n  Course of Artillery.\r\n  Course of Veterinary Art.\r\n  Sham Siege (part relating to Artillery.)\r\n  Course of Military Law and Administration.\r\n\r\nSecond. Examination, held by the Field Officer of Engineers.\r\n\r\n  Course of Permanent Fortification and the Attack and Defense\r\n    of Places.\r\n  Course of Construction.\r\n  Sham Siege (part relating to the Engineering.)\r\n\r\nThird. Examination, held by the third Examiner, taken either from the\r\nArtillery or Engineers, in the--\r\n\r\n  Course of Mechanics.\r\n  Course of Applied Sciences.\r\n  Course of Topography and Geodesy.\r\n  German Language.\r\n\r\nEvery Student, on presenting himself before the Examiners, submits for\r\ntheir approbation the drawings and manuscripts relating to the subjects\r\non which the examination is to bear. Independent of the questions which\r\nare placed before him by the Examiners, the Student Sub-lieutenant must\r\nreply to any objections or questions which the members of the Jury may\r\nthink fit to address to him.\r\n\r\nThe German Master directly questions the Students, if the Jury wish it.\r\nThe Professors or their Assistants must be present at the examinations\r\nrelating to their course.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the examination is ended, the members of the Jury retire to\r\nan adjoining room with closed doors, to determine on the amount of marks\r\nto be given to the Student examined.\r\n\r\nWhen the trials of all kinds are finished, the Jury proceed to the\r\ndefinitive classification of the Students belonging to each arm. In\r\nmaking this classification, regard is had to the following\r\nconsiderations:--\r\n\r\n1st. Each examination has a co-efficient of importance equal to the sum\r\nof all the different courses which are included in it.\r\n\r\n2nd. The co-efficient of importance for drawing is equal to the 1/20 of\r\nthe sum of the co-efficients of the three examinations.\r\n\r\n3rd. The co-efficient of importance of the practice, drill, &c., is, as\r\nfor the courses, the sum of the co-efficients appropriated to the works\r\ntaught in the School.\r\n\r\nBy multiplying the co-efficients of importance by the mean number of\r\nmarks of merit obtained by the Students in the different examinations,\r\nthe definitive credit which must be assigned to each Student in the\r\nTable of Classification is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe classification of the School enters into the definitive\r\nclassification for a value equal to one-third of the total number of the\r\nthree examinations, without comprising the valuation of the drawings;\r\nthis value is added to the credits determined above.\r\n\r\nThe Jury give an account of the proceedings of the examinations in a\r\n“_procès-verbal_” addressed to the Minister by the General acting as\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nIII.

DRAWING ORDNANCE (12 DAYS.)\r\n\r\nThe survey of ordnance consists in constructing accurate sketches of a\r\ngun, howitzer, and mortar, in measuring their dimensions, and in giving\r\na description of each of the pieces drawn. It is on this occasion that\r\nthe students are practiced in the management of instruments to insure\r\nprecision, such as the _étoile mobile_, and the sliding compass, &c. One\r\nday is devoted to this work.\r\n\r\nThe tracing of ordnance consists in the execution of a drawing upon\r\ncolombier paper, containing an exact and detailed representation of a\r\ngun, a howitzer, and a mortar, with their projectiles.\r\n\r\nThis work is performed with the help of the tables for the construction\r\nof ordnance. Eleven days are devoted to it.\r\n\r\n_Detailed Programme of the Drawing._\r\n\r\n1. For each gun, howitzer, or mortar, a longitudinal section in the\r\ndirection of the axis, and at right angles to the axis of the trunnions,\r\nand a plan parallel to the axis of the bore and of the trunnions.\r\n\r\nBesides this, for those cannon and howitzers which have dolphins, a\r\ntransverse section taken across the middle of the dolphins and the axis\r\nof the trunnions. For mortars, a transverse section made by a plane\r\npassing in front of the dolphins, the whole on a scale of one-fifth.\r\n\r\n2. Detail of the button (comprising the cascable and breeching loop for\r\nnaval ordnance) on a scale of two-fifths.\r\n\r\n3. Detail of the tracing of a dolphin, on the scale of two-fifths.\r\n\r\n4. Tracing of the bush of a gun, on a scale of two-fifths, and tracing\r\nof a priming-pan at the real size.\r\n\r\n5. For garrison ordnance, in cast-iron, detail of the widening of the\r\nbase ring on a scale of two-fifths.\r\n\r\n6. Tracing of a cannon-ball, of a howitzer-shell, and of a shell, on a\r\nscale of one-fifth.\r\n\r\nTracing of the lugs of a shell, ring and lug at the real size.\r\n\r\nAll the parts of the drawing must be colored in uniform tints in\r\nconformity to the table of conventional colors; the annexation of the\r\nfigures of measurement is not required.\r\n\r\nThis work is preceded by three or four lectures intended to make the\r\nstudents familiar with the tracings which they have to execute, and the\r\nsolution of the problems in geometry and descriptive geometry, to which\r\nthe representation on paper of pieces of ordnance and their projectiles\r\ngive rise.\r\n\r\nII. DESIGN FOR ORDNANCE (24 DAYS.)\r\n\r\nThe design for ordnance has for its object the complete determination of\r\nthe nature of a projectile, and of a piece of ordnance in accordance\r\nwith certain special conditions, inquiring into the laws of the motion\r\nof the projectile, and into its principal destructive effects, and the\r\nsettlement of practice-tables for the gun. The general case for\r\ntreatment is that of a howitzer, which comprehends the gun and the\r\nmortar as particular cases.\r\n\r\nThe data usually adopted are,--\r\n\r\n  1. For the projectile, its weight and the quantity of powder which it\r\nis capable of containing.\r\n\r\n  2. For the piece, the initial velocity of its projectile. This\r\noperation comprises calculations, a drawing, and a memoir.\r\n\r\nThe drawing, on colombier paper, which must be figured in all its parts,\r\ncontains,--\r\n\r\n  1. The tracing of the profile of the piece, as it is determined by\r\ncalculation, so as to satisfy the different conditions of resistance, on\r\na scale of one-fifth.\r\n\r\n  2. The complete tracing of the piece executed in conformity with the\r\nrules laid down for the tracing of ordnance on a scale of one-fifth.\r\n\r\n  3. Tracing of the projectile on a scale of one-fifth.\r\n\r\n  4. Tracing of the wooden bottom and of the fuse of the projectile,\r\nexecuted in the case of each of these objects in two figures--the one on\r\na large scale (two-thirds, or even the size of nature,) representing the\r\ninquiry into their forms and dimensions, the other giving on a scale of\r\none-fifth the results of this inquiry. To this is added, for the\r\nmountain howitzer, or any other howitzer for which it is admissible, a\r\ntracing of the mounted howitzer carriage.\r\n\r\n  5. The representation in drawing of the laws of the motion of the\r\nprojectile, the trajectory, inclinations, remaining velocities,\r\ndurations of the passage.\r\n\r\n  In addition, the scale of the elevations and that of the angles of\r\nfire, for an object of aim placed at different distances.\r\n\r\n  6. An inscription showing all the essential elements by which the\r\nprojectile and the piece are distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe final tracings of the gun, the projectile, the bottom, and the fuse,\r\nmust be colored in uniform tints conformably to the table of\r\nconventional colors.\r\n\r\nAs to the tracing of the profile founded upon the calculation, it should\r\nreceive merely an edging of the color which represents the metal used.\r\n\r\nPROGRAMME OF THE MEMORANDUM ON THE DESIGN FOR ORDNANCE.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n_Object of the work.

It will be sufficient\r\nto insert in this notice only the final result of the calculation\r\nrelating to each formula, without entering into the details of such\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nThe study of the design for ordnance is preceded by four lessons\r\nintended to make the students acquainted with all the details of its\r\nexecution, and the substance of which is indicated in the programme of\r\nthe memoir.\r\n\r\nIII. APPLICATION OF THE THEORIES OF THE ARTILLERY COURSE (6 DAYS.)\r\n\r\nThis study is intended to apply to the students those theories of the\r\ncourse which have not found their application in the design for\r\nordnance. It comprises the solution by arithmetical calculations of\r\ncertain questions on the effects of powder, the balistic pendulum, the\r\neffects of recoil, the science of projectiles, the draught of carriages,\r\n&c. The number of the questions may vary according to their nature and\r\nthe time which their solution requires. The stating of the questions and\r\nthe results of the calculations are inscribed on separate papers. This\r\nstudy is preceded by a lesson in which the students have recalled to\r\nthem the formulas which they have to employ.\r\n\r\nIV. DRAWING OF ARTILLERY MATERIAL (26 DAYS.)\r\n\r\nThe drawing of artillery material has for its object the representation\r\nby figured sketches of a gun-carriage, carriage, or other furniture of\r\nartillery material. The sketches, on paper put together in the form of a\r\nbook, and headed by a special programme for the object to be drawn,\r\nconsist of plans, sections, or elevations of the object, executed on\r\ncertain scales, and of detailed projections of the principal iron-work\r\nand joints. The whole fixed by the special programme in question.\r\n\r\nAll the simultaneous projections of any one part of the object drawn\r\n(fore part or hind part for carriages) must be completely figured; they\r\nare accompanied by explanatory inscriptions, with letters of reference\r\nto show the names of the pieces in wood or metal which they comprise.\r\n\r\nEach collection of sketches must contain as well a notice in\r\nconfirmation of the drawing, giving the complete description and the\r\nproperties of the object to which it refers.\r\n\r\nThe students make two surveys of the same kind; eight days are allowed\r\nfor each of these surveys, including the composition of the confirmatory\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nThe first survey is followed by the execution of an unfigured drawing,\r\ncontaining a complete representation of the object surveyed (elevation\r\nand plan,) obtained by the combination of the partial projections\r\ncontained in the sketch. The drawing should be colored in the\r\nconventional uniform tints, and accompanied by an explanatory\r\ninscription, with letters of reference. Ten days are devoted to this\r\nwork of composition.\r\n\r\nV. TRACING OF BATTERIES (4 DAYS.)\r\n\r\nThis work consists in executing sketches showing, each in accordance\r\nwith a separate programme, the complete plan of a battery and the\r\nessential data having reference to its construction and to its armament.\r\nThe sketches, made by scale and completely figured, must comprise in the\r\ncase of each battery to be represented--\r\n\r\n  1. The general plan of the battery, on the scale of 1/200.\r\n\r\n  2. The sections or elevations necessary for the understanding of this\r\nplan, including the detail of the powder magazines, lines of\r\ncommunication, &c., on the scale of 1/100.\r\n\r\n  3. An inscription giving the object of the battery, its armament, its\r\ngeneral arrangement (_terre-plein_, embrasures, revetment,\r\ncommunications, magazines, &c.,) the workmen, materials, and tools\r\nnecessary for its construction, and finally the duration of the labor\r\nand its distribution by day and night.\r\n\r\n  Four days are devoted to this work, which must be executed on a half\r\nsheet of colombier paper. The separate programmes relating to each of\r\nthese batteries are shown on the study orders of the rooms.\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATIVE TABLE.--ARTILLERY STUDENTS.\r\n\r\n  [KEY]\r\n  NL Number of the Lectures.\r\n  CG Credits given for the Lectures.\r\n  +A With application at 1h 50m.\r\n  -A Without application at 3h.\r\n  TC Total Credits.\r\n  Q  Number of the Questions.\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------+----+------------+--------+----\r\n    LECTURES                       |    |     CG     |        |\r\n                                   |    +-------+----+        |\r\n                                   | NL | +A    | -A |   TC   |  Q\r\n  ---------------------------------+----+-------+----+--------+----\r\n  Division of the Course--         |    |       |    |        |\r\n  First Part.

Project for the repair of a broken arch; being given the opening of\r\nthe head, the elevation of the roadway of the bridge above the level of\r\nthe water; the depth of the water, the rapidity of the current, the kind\r\nof troops to pass over the bridge, and the available time and the\r\nresources as regards men and materials which can be had recourse to.\r\n\r\n_Programme of the Project of Field Fortification._\r\n\r\nThis project is made by the Sub-Lieutenants, according to certain data\r\ngiven to each of them. It has for its object to cause them to\r\nstudy:--1st. The trace. 2d. The complete organization necessary for its\r\ndefense. 3d. The details of construction of a field-work. In\r\nconsequence, the work comprises three Plates of Drawings and a Memoir\r\ndivided into three parts.\r\n\r\n_Programme of the Drawings._\r\n\r\nPlate 1.--Plan of the whole. This plate has for its object the research\r\nof a trace and of a combination of suitable works for the fortification\r\nof a certain portion of ground under certain circumstances of war\r\ndefined by particular data. Each Sub-Lieutenant receives a lithographed\r\nsheet representing the ground to be fortified, and he has to exhibit on\r\nthis sheet the works he proposes, in tracing in plain lines the\r\nhorizontal projections of the interior crests and superior limits of the\r\nditch, and in dotted lines the stockades or palisades; to show in black\r\nfigures at the angles of the works the relief of the interior crests;\r\nthe sites of barbettes, embrasures, traverses, barriers, &c., being\r\nindicated by reference letters and explanatory notes, the lines in red\r\nshowing the directions and objects of the line of fire.\r\n\r\nPlate 2.--Organization of a work.\r\n\r\nThis plate has for its object the study of the details of the interior\r\nand exterior organization of a work of a certain form, in order to\r\nrender it susceptible of making a good defense.\r\n\r\nEach Sub-Lieutenant will draw a complete plan of such one of the works\r\nshown on Plate 1, as may be pointed out by the Professor. He will\r\nrepresent the ditches, parapets, embrasures, accessory defenses, small\r\nentrenchments, descents into the ditch, &c., according to the particular\r\ndata furnished to him; the figures of the relief of the crests of all\r\nkinds, the deblais and remblais being marked at all the angles. The\r\nfigures of the natural ground will be underlined. The same plate will\r\ncontain figured profiles which have served for the determination of the\r\ncomplete projection of the work. Scale 1/250.\r\n\r\nPlate 3.--Details of construction.\r\n\r\nThe object of this plate is to show the composition of workshops and the\r\nmanner that should be adopted in the construction of field-works,\r\naccording to circumstances, for the execution of the deblais and\r\nremblais.\r\n\r\nEach Sub-Lieutenant will indicate the manner in which the work drawn on\r\nPlate 2 should be constructed:--1st. To render it durable and solid. 2d.\r\nTo arrive rapidly at a useful result, even with limited resources of\r\nworkmen and tools. 3d. To finish the work in the shortest possible time,\r\nby making use of all the necessary means. A plan will show the\r\ncomposition of the workshops under each of these hypotheses, and the\r\nsuccessive advancement of the work will be represented by certain\r\nprofiles supposed to be made at certain periods of the construction\r\nthrough the center of one of the faces of the work. In these profiles a\r\nfirm trace, figured with altitudes, will show the limits of the deblais\r\nand remblais at the period represented by the profiles; and in addition\r\nby dotted lines, the final results proposed to be obtained. All these\r\nprojects must be accompanied by a figured plan, showing the principal\r\naltitudes in meters. The remblais will be colored with gamboge, the\r\nundisturbed earth in bistre, and the deblais will be left white.\r\n\r\n_Programme of the Memoir._\r\n\r\nEach Sub-Lieutenant will write at the head of his Memoir the text of the\r\nparticular programme, to which he is obliged to conform in the\r\npreparation of his project, and he should add to the text of the Memoir\r\nall the sketches properly figured, which are necessary for the proper\r\nappreciation of the dispositions which are not sufficiently detailed on\r\nthe Drawings.\r\n\r\nThe Memoir is divided into three parts, corresponding to the three\r\nPlates of Drawings.\r\n\r\nFIRST PART.--CONSIDERATIONS RESPECTING THE WHOLE PROJECT.\r\n\r\n1st. General principles, according to which it would be proper to trace\r\nthe works indicated in the particular programme, such as lines at\r\nintervals, continuous lines, têtes de pont, &c.\r\n\r\n2d.

Details of construction of the revetments, magazines, shutters,\r\naccessory defenses, artillery platforms, &c.\r\n\r\nIII. PROGRAMME OF EXTERIOR WORKS.\r\n\r\nThese works consist of an exercise in tracing out a camp, and an\r\nexercise on the profiling and defilement of field-works.\r\n\r\nThe exercise on tracing camps has no particular programme, but is\r\npreceded by a lecture given by the Professor.\r\n\r\n_Programme of Practical Exercises on the Defilement and Profiling of\r\nField Works._\r\n\r\nThis exercise comprehends: 1st, work on the ground; 2d, a Memoir.\r\n\r\nThe work on the ground has for its object: 1st, the trace of the\r\nprojections of the interior crest of a work, whose position and form are\r\nknown; 2d, the determination of the relief of the interior crest; 3d,\r\nthe profiling of the different parts, so that the relief of the\r\ndifferent parts of the parapet, barbettes, traverses, &c., may all be\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Lieutenants for this kind of work are divided into groups of six\r\nor eight, employed together on the same work, each group being divided\r\ninto two squads. The work may be a lunette or a redan of given\r\ndimensions, having a parapet of three meters thick, and a natural slope\r\nof one to one.\r\n\r\n1st. The direction of the capital will be marked out in front by two\r\nnumbered pickets.\r\n\r\n2d. The tracing will be executed by means of poles or pickets placed at\r\nall the angles, and at the extremities of the gorge; the relief will be\r\ndetermined by the practical methods of defilement adverted to in the\r\nlecture which preceded the work.\r\n\r\n3d. The relief obtained by the defilement will be marked on all the\r\npoles or pickets placed at the angles, and at the extremities of the\r\nsides of the work.\r\n\r\n4th. On each face two vertical profiles will be executed, perpendicular\r\nto the horizontal projections of its interior crest. In order that these\r\nprofiles shall not interfere with those placed at the angles, they must\r\nbe established at several meters distant from the extremity of each\r\nface.\r\n\r\n5th. The profiles of the angles will be deducted by simple\r\nprolongations, and the same for the profiles of the gorge. If the\r\nhomologous crests of two contiguous faces do not meet each other, they\r\nshould be reconciled by joining two points taken on each of them at half\r\na meter from the intersection of their projections.\r\n\r\n6th. On the traverse, designed to secure the defenders from a reverse\r\nfire, two profiles are constructed, near to its extremities if its crest\r\nis a right line, but if it is bent, another profile must be set up at\r\nthe junction.\r\n\r\n7th. The data of all these profiles are, the relief of the interior\r\ncrest at the point where it is encountered by the profile, the thickness\r\nof the parapet, the constant parts of every profile, and the natural\r\nslope of the ground; the portion of the slope of the traverses exposed\r\nto the view of the dominant heights should not be reveted, the others\r\nshould be.\r\n\r\n8th. At the points of intersection of the profiles with the projections\r\nof the ridges of the works, as well as at the points used for adjusting,\r\npoles or pickets are placed, on which the points belonging to the ridges\r\nare marked. These points will be joined together in each profile by\r\ntwine, indicating the different planes of the work.\r\n\r\n9th. The form and dimensions of the batteries, either of barbettes or\r\nembrasures, will be equally determined by poles or pickets placed at all\r\ntheir angles, and united together by twine in the manner that will be\r\nsubsequently explained.\r\n\r\n10th. For the barbette batteries, the first thing to be done is to\r\nestablish and to construct the front coupé of the salient of the\r\ninterior crest, and substitute an interior horizontal crest throughout\r\nthe extent of the barbette for that situated in the plane of defilement.\r\nThe necessary adjustments are then made between the slope of the parapet\r\nof the barbette and that of the rest of the face, and indicate by means\r\nof twine the intersections of the terre-plein of the barbette and of its\r\nslope with the different planes of the work.\r\n\r\n11th. For the embrasures, after having determined their direction, the\r\nintersections of the cheeks and bottom, with the interior and exterior\r\nslope of the parapet, and with its slope; also the slope which\r\nterminates the interruption of the banquette throughout the extent of\r\nthe battery. In the case where the platform is formed more than 0^m 4\r\nelevated above the soil, a ramp is constructed with its slope, and the\r\nintersections with the slope from the platform are shown.\r\n\r\n12th. After the batteries, the slope of the ends of the traverses and of\r\nthe passages for entry and exit are constructed.\r\n\r\n13th. The traverse will be finished by adjusting its different planes\r\nwith those of the parapet. In the particular case, where it was\r\ninterfered with to make a passage over the banquette, it is finished by\r\nreveting the slope passing by the crest of the banquette of the work.\r\n\r\n14th. At the passages of entry and exit from the work, the parapets will\r\nbe finished by the slope of the revetment, whose intersections with the\r\ndifferent planes of the parapets must be determined.\r\n\r\n15th.

PROGRAMME OF THE COURSE OF TOPOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nThe course of Topography comprehends two parts.\r\n\r\nThe first relates to the art of topographical drawing, and the second\r\nto the art of making topographical surveys. Both parts are carried on\r\n_pari passu_; but as the order in which the different branches of the\r\ninstruction can be given depends very much on the other works carried on\r\nin the School, it will be more convenient to give the programme for each\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nFIRST PART.--INSTRUCTION IN TOPOGRAPHICAL DRAWING.\r\n\r\nThe instruction in topographical drawing comprehends lectures and\r\nexercises in graphical representation. It is based on a complete\r\nexposition of the conventional principles of this species of drawing,\r\nand it is illustrated by engraved examples of the characteristics\r\nadopted for the representation of the various details.\r\n\r\n_First Section.--Lectures._\r\n\r\nThe lectures have for their object the explanation of the general\r\nprinciples of the instruction in topographical drawing, and the\r\ngeometrical conditions which should regulate the shading of maps and\r\ntheir reduction. They immediately precede the exercise to which they\r\nrelate.\r\n\r\nLecture 1 relates to small maps, copies, and reductions of these; and it\r\nexplains the object of topographical maps, the various kinds and the\r\ndifferent scales generally used. The manner in which the form of the\r\nground is represented by equi-distant contour or level lines is also\r\nexplained, and mention is made of the conventional tints used, and the\r\nspecies of writing and value of the scale employed.\r\n\r\nLectures 2 and 3 relate to the execution of shaded plans by the brush\r\nand the pen, under different circumstances of light and shade.\r\n\r\nLecture 4 explains the different methods for reducing topographical\r\nmaps, also the description, mode of using, and verification of\r\npentagraphs.\r\n\r\n_Second Section.--Exercises._\r\n\r\nThese exercises are intended to teach the students the conventional\r\nsigns used in topographical drawing, and to give them facilities with\r\nthe pencil and brush for producing shaded maps, and in reducing them\r\nfrom one scale to another.\r\n\r\nSECOND PART.--INSTRUCTION IN TOPOGRAPHICAL SURVEYING.\r\n\r\nThis instruction comprises:\r\n\r\n  1st. Lectures given in amphitheatre.\r\n  2d. Practical lectures or exercises.\r\n  3d. The execution of topographical surveys.\r\n\r\n_First Section.--Oral Lectures._\r\n\r\nThese lectures are divided in two classes, which comprehend:--\r\n\r\n  1st. Those relating to the description of the instruments, and of the\r\nmethods used in topography.\r\n\r\n  2d. Those which have reference to the manner in which the students\r\nshould proceed in the execution of the work, and principally of surveys\r\nof limited extent.\r\n\r\nEight lectures are devoted to the description of the various\r\ninstruments, the method of adjusting their errors, and the manner of\r\nusing them, as well as to the different ways of proceeding in\r\ntopography; touching also on the various modes of measuring distances,\r\nwith descriptions of the compass, plane table, and instruments used for\r\nleveling, and on the taking observations for and preparation of\r\nsections, and the orientation of maps.\r\n\r\nFour preparatory lectures are given, showing the manner in which the\r\nstudents should proceed when on the ground to make a survey of small\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nTwo lectures relate to the methods that should be employed in making a\r\nsurvey of considerable extent, and on the appropriate scales.\r\n\r\nTwo lectures on military reconnaissance plans; instruments and scales\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nTwo preparatory lectures relate to the execution of a reconnaissance\r\nplan, in which the operations of a sham siege are intended to be\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n_Second Section.--Practical Lectures or Exercises._\r\n\r\nThe object of these lectures, which take place on the glacis of the\r\nfortification, is to show the students the practical modes of using the\r\ninstruments, and the precautions which must be taken, together with the\r\nmost elementary proceedings in topography. They are given to ten or\r\ntwelve students at the same time, and the Professor is assisted by an\r\nofficer of the staff. Each lecture lasts two and a half hours.\r\n\r\n_Third Section.--On the Execution of Topographical Surveys._\r\n\r\nThe object is to familiarize the students with the use of the principal\r\ninstruments and the principal operations, and they comprehend\r\nout-of-door work, of which the results are sketches, registers, and\r\nminutes made in pencil, and in the construction of plans, and inking in\r\nof the minutes in the Halls of Study.\r\n\r\nThe out-of-door work is performed under the superintendence of officers\r\nof the staff, who assist the students in their work. The construction of\r\nthe plans is not commenced until the pencil minutes have been examined\r\nby the Professor.\r\n\r\nThese exercises comprise:--\r\n\r\n  1st and 2d. Construction of plans by the aid of the compass.\r\n  3d. The plan of a fortification made with the plane table.\r\n  4th. The determination of the variation of the compass.\r\n  5th. The execution of a second survey by the aid of the compass.\r\n  6th.         “       “  rapid survey by pacing the distances.\r\n  7th.         “       “  reconnaissance survey.\r\n  8th.         “       “  an itinerary and reconnaissance sketch.\r\n  9th. The preparation of a plan on which the whole of the operations\r\n    of a sham siege may be laid down, as the works of attack and\r\n    defense proceed.\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION FOR THE ARTILLERY AND ENGINEERS.\r\n\r\n  [KEY]\r\n  Cr Credits for Lectures.\r\n  NL Number of Lectures.\r\n  +A With application.\r\n  -A Without application.\r\n  T  Total Credits.\r\n  I  Number of Interrogations.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------------------+----+------------------+---\r\n                                      |    |        Cr        |\r\n                                      |    +------------------+\r\n  I.

PROGRAMME OF THE COURSE OF GEODESY AND DIALLING.\r\n\r\nThis course is divided into two parts--the one part special for the\r\nengineers, and the other common to the artillery and engineers.\r\n\r\nThe first comprises:--\r\n\r\n  1st. The study of the execution of a triangulation of some extent, and\r\nof its connection with the general triangulation of France, executed\r\nunder the superintendence of the Dépôt de la Guerre, and\r\n\r\n  2d. Leveling with the barometer.\r\n\r\nThe second contains:--\r\n\r\n  1st. The study of reflecting instruments.\r\n\r\n  2d. The principles of dialling.\r\n\r\nEach of these parts comprehend:--\r\n\r\n  1st. Lectures given in the amphitheatre.\r\n\r\n  2d. Practical lectures or exercises.\r\n\r\n  3d. An application.\r\n\r\nFIRST PART.--SPECIAL FOR ENGINEERS.\r\n\r\n1st Section--Lectures.\r\n\r\nThese Lectures include:--\r\n\r\n  1st. A description of the principal geodesical instruments.\r\n\r\n  2d. The establishment of the triangulation.\r\n\r\n  3d. The survey and the calculations connected with it.\r\n\r\n  4th. The orientation of the triangulation.\r\n\r\n  5th. The calculation of the co-ordinates of the points and their\r\nconstruction from the minutes of the survey.\r\n\r\n  6th. The geodesical and barometrical leveling.\r\n\r\nThe first lecture is devoted to the explanation of the different kind of\r\nsignals used under various circumstances; on the method of measuring\r\nbases and angles, and the principles on which these operations are\r\nperformed; and concluding with the description and mode of using certain\r\ninstruments for measuring angles.\r\n\r\nThe second lecture continues and enlarges on the subject of the\r\nmeasurement of angles, horizontal and vertical, with different kinds of\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nThe third lecture relates to the corrections and reductions which must\r\nbe made to observed angles, such as the correction for the eccentricity\r\nof the instruments, to the reduction of the angles to the horizon, and\r\nto the center of the station, and also on the adjustments of the\r\ninstruments, or the application of corrections for certain errors.\r\n\r\nThe fourth lecture discusses the calculation of the triangles and their\r\nerrors, and points out the best organization that can be given to the\r\ntriangulation, and the exactitude which can be expected from it.\r\n\r\nThe fifth lecture also relates to the calculation and the development of\r\nthe triangulation, and explains the nature of the geodesical operations\r\nfor the map of France.\r\n\r\nThe sixth lecture explains the manner of observing for, and\r\ndetermination of the azimuthal bearing, for the orientation of the\r\ntriangulation.\r\n\r\nThe seventh lecture has reference to the convergence of meridians,\r\ncalculation of rectangular co-ordinates, sundry problems, and geodesical\r\nleveling.\r\n\r\nThe eighth lecture shows in what manner the barometer is made use of for\r\nthe determination of differences of altitude, the nature of the\r\ncorrections to be applied to the instrument, and the degree of\r\nexactitude to be found in the results of this process.\r\n\r\nThe ninth lecture points out the order in which geodesical calculations\r\nshould be performed and the verifications which should be exacted.\r\n\r\nThe Second Section contains five lectures or exercises, and they have\r\nfor their object to familiarize the students with the use of the various\r\nkinds of instruments employed in carrying on the operations which have\r\nbeen shortly described in the first section.\r\n\r\nThe Third Section relates to the practical application of the preceding\r\nprinciples, and mostly consists of geodesical applications.\r\n\r\nSECOND PART.--COMMON TO THE ARTILLERY AND ENGINEERS.\r\n\r\nThe First Section consists of lectures given in the amphitheatre, and\r\nrelates to reflecting instruments, such as the sextant, reflecting\r\ncircle, and the method of using them, and also on the principles of\r\ndialling, and its connection with various problems in astronomy;\r\ndescribes also the different kinds of dials.\r\n\r\nSECOND SECTION.--PRACTICAL EXERCISES.\r\n\r\nIn which the students are called upon, in the presence of the Professor,\r\nto adjust the sextant, and to use it in connection with an artificial\r\nhorizon for the measurement of the angle between any two objects of the\r\naltitude of these

This instruction is described under the head of Practical\r\nMilitary Instruction; it comprises at the maximum 272 attendances, and\r\nits credit of influence is valued at 240.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nARTILLERY AND ENGINEERS’ REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ARTILLERY REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThese are intended for the theoretical and practical instruction of\r\nofficers, _sous-officiers_, and gunners.\r\n\r\nEach School is under the orders of the General of Brigade commanding the\r\nArtillery in the military division in which it is situated.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the general officer, the school has the following\r\nstaff:--\r\n\r\n  A Lieutenant (associated assistant to the General.)\r\n  A Professor of Sciences, applying more particularly to the Artillery.\r\n  A Professor of Fortification, of drawing, and construction of\r\n    buildings.\r\n  Two _Gardes_ of Artillery (one of the first, and the other of the\r\n    second class.)\r\n\r\nThere are, in addition, attached to each school the number of inferior\r\nofficers (captains, lieutenants, or _sous-lieutenants_) required for\r\ncarrying on the theoretical courses, which are not placed under the\r\ndirection of the professors.\r\n\r\nA captain of the first class, assisted by two first lieutenants, is the\r\ndirector of the park of the school. Another captain, also of the first\r\nclass, but taken from the regiment of Pontooneers, has the direction of\r\nthat portion of the bridge equipage necessary for the special\r\ninstruction of this corps, as well as of the material of the artillery\r\nproperly belonging to this instruction.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant-colonel, assistant to the general, fulfills, independent\r\nof every other detail of supervision with which he may be charged, the\r\nfunctions of _ordonnateur secondaire_, in what concerns the expenses of\r\nthe school and their propriety (_justification_.) He corresponds with\r\nthe minister of war for this part of the service.\r\n\r\nThe instruction is divided into _theoretical_ and _practical_, and the\r\nannual course is divided into half-yearly periods, or into summer and\r\nwinter instructions.\r\n\r\nThe summer instruction commences, according to different localities,\r\nfrom the 1st of April to the 1st of May, and that of the winter from the\r\n1st of October to the 1st of November.\r\n\r\nThe winter and summer instruction is subdivided into school and\r\nregimental instruction.\r\n\r\nThe school instruction comprehends all the _theoretical_ and _practical_\r\ninstruction common to the different corps which require the assistance\r\nof the particular means of the school, the employment of its professors,\r\nlocality, and material, as that of the practical instruction in which\r\nthe troops belonging to the different corps of the army are united to\r\ntake part.\r\n\r\nThe regimental instruction is that which exists in the interior of the\r\nregiments and the various bodies of the artillery. It is directed by the\r\nchiefs of these corps, who are responsible for it, with the means placed\r\nat their disposal, under the general surveillance of the commandant of\r\nthe school.\r\n\r\nThe special instruction of the Pontooneers not admitting of their\r\nfollowing the same instruction as the other regiments of artillery, the\r\nchief of this corps directs the special instruction according to certain\r\nbases prescribed by the regulations.\r\n\r\nThere are for the captains of artillery, each year during the winter\r\nhalf-year, six conferences for the purposes of considering and\r\ndiscussing projects for the organization of different equipages and\r\narmaments for the field service, and for attack and defense of places.\r\n\r\nIn a building belonging to each school of artillery, under the name of\r\nthe hotel of the school, are united the halls and establishments\r\nnecessary for the theoretical instruction of the officers and\r\nsous-officers, such as halls for _théorique_ drill and drawing, library,\r\ndepots of maps and plans, halls for machines, instruments and models,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nEach school is provided with a physical cabinet and a chemical\r\nlaboratory. There is also a piece of ground, called a polygon, for\r\nexercising artillerymen to the manœuvers of cannon and other firearms of\r\ngreat range. Its extent is sufficient in length to furnish a range of\r\n1,200 meters, and in breadth of 600 meters.\r\n\r\nPermanent and temporary batteries are established on this ground, and\r\nthey seem not only for practice, but also to accustom the men to the\r\nconstruction of fascines, field batteries, &c.\r\n\r\nThe administration of each school, and the accounts relating to it, are\r\ndirected by an administrative council, consisting of--\r\n\r\n  The General Officer commanding the Artillery (President.)\r\n\r\n  The Colonels of the regiments of Artillery in the towns where two\r\nregiments of the Artillery are quartered, and in other towns, the\r\nColonel and Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment.\r\n\r\n  The Colonel of the regiment of Pontooneers in the town where the\r\nprincipal part of the corps may be stationed, and in any other town the\r\nLieutenant-Colonel or the Major.\r\n\r\n  The Lieutenant-Colonel associated assistant with the General\r\nCommandant.\r\n\r\nThe functions of secretary of the council are intrusted to a _grade_ of\r\nthe first class.\r\n\r\nThe functionaries of the corps of intendants fulfill, in connection with\r\nthe administrative councils of the artillery schools, the same duties as\r\nare assigned by the regulations relating to the interior administration\r\nof bodies of troops. They will exercise over the accounts, both of money\r\nand material of the said schools, the same control as over the\r\nadministration connected with the military interests of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ENGINEER REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThe colonel of each regiment has the superior direction of the\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nThe lieutenant-colonel directs and superintends, under his orders, the\r\nwhole of the details of the regimental instruction.\r\n\r\nA major, selected from among the officers of this rank belonging to the\r\n_état-major_ of this arm, directs and superintends, under the orders of\r\nthe colonel, the whole of the details of the special instruction.\r\n\r\nThe complete instruction consists of--\r\n\r\nGeneral instruction, or that of the regiment, by which a man is made a\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\nSpecial or school instruction, having for its object the training of the\r\nminer or sapper.\r\n\r\nThe instructions are each separated into _theoretical_ and _practical_\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical instruction of the regiment comprehends the theories:--\r\n\r\n  On the exercises and manœuvers of infantry. On the interior service.\r\nOn the service of the place. On field service. On the maintenance of\r\narms. On military administration. On military penal legislation.\r\n\r\nThe practical instruction of the regiment comprises:--\r\n\r\n  The exercises and manœuvers of infantry. Practice with the musket.\r\nMilitary Marches. Fencing.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of these various duties is confided to officers,\r\n_sous-officiers_, and corporals of the regiments, as pointed out by the\r\nregulation, and the orders of the colonel.\r\n\r\nThe fencing school is organized in a similar manner to those of the\r\ninfantry, and the military marches are also made in the same way as in\r\nthose corps.\r\n\r\nThe _special_ and _theoretical_ instruction consists of:--\r\n\r\n  Primary instruction. Mathematics. Drawing. Geography. Military history\r\nof France. Fortification and the various branches of the engineering\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThree civil professors (appointed by competition) are attached to each\r\nregimental school, for the special theoretical instruction, as regards\r\nthe primary instruction, drawing, and mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe courses are distributed and taught in the following manner:\r\n\r\n  Primary instruction for the Soldiers.  }\r\n  French grammar for the Corporals.      }\r\n  Book-keeping for the _Sous-Officiers_. }\r\n      By the Professor of Primary Instruction.\r\n\r\n  Elementary arithmetic for the Corporals. }\r\n  Complete arithmetic }                    }\r\n  Elementary geometry }                    }\r\n    for the Serjeants.                     }\r\n  Complete geometry }                      }\r\n  Trigonometry      }                      }\r\n    for the Serjeant-Major.                }\r\n  Surveys for the _Sous-Officiers_.        }\r\n  Special mathematics for the Officers.    }\r\n      By the Prof. of Mathematics.\r\n\r\n  Drawing for the Corporals and _Sous-Officers_.\r\n      By the Professor of Drawing, who is also charged with\r\n      completing the collection of models which relate to it.\r\n\r\n  The elements of fortification for the Serjeant-Majors. }\r\n  Construction, and theories on practical schools        }\r\n    for the _Sous-Officiers_.                            }\r\n  Permanent fortification          }                     }\r\n  The attack and defense of places }                     }\r\n  Mines                            }                     }\r\n  Bridges                          }                     }\r\n  Ovens                            }                     }\r\n  Topography                       }                     }\r\n    for the Officers.                                    }\r\n  Geography                        }                     }\r\n  Military history of France       }                     }\r\n    for the _Sous-Officiers_.                            }\r\n      By the Officers of the regiment, named by the Colonel,\r\n      independently of those appointed by the regulations\r\n\r\nAt the end of each course the colonel of the regiment causes a general\r\nexamination to be made in his presence of the whole of the men who have\r\nfollowed this course, and has a list made out in the order of merit,\r\nwith notes of the capacity and aptitude of each.\r\n\r\nThese lists are consulted in the formation of tables of promotion, and\r\nplaced with the said tables before the inspector-general.\r\n\r\nEach captain and lieutenant are obliged to give in at least a single\r\ntreatise on five different projects, consisting of a memoir discussing\r\nor the journal of a siege, with drawing of the whole, and of details in\r\nsufficient number to render them perfectly intelligible.\r\n\r\nThe _special practical_ instruction is composed of seven distinct\r\nschools, relating to:--\r\n\r\n  Field Fortification. Saps. Mines and Fireworks. Bridges. Ovens.\r\nTopography. Gymnastics.\r\n\r\nAnd they comprehend, in addition, sham sieges, and underground war. Each\r\nof these seven schools is taught in accordance with the special\r\ninstructions annexed to the regulation, which, however, are not\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nWinter is more especially devoted to the course of special theoretical\r\ninstruction, which commences on the 1st November, and usually finishes\r\non the 15th March, and the course of _special practical_ instruction is\r\ncarried on during the summer from the 15th March to the 15th September.\r\nThe second fortnight of September and the month of October are devoted\r\nto sham sieges and underground war, to the leveling of the works\r\nexecuted, and to the arrangement of magazines.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL FOR INFANTRY AND CAVALRY\r\n\r\nAT ST. CYR.\r\n\r\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION. CONDITIONS OF ADMISSION. STAFF.\r\n\r\nIt will have been seen in the accounts of the Polytechnic School and the\r\nSchool of Application at Metz, in what manner young men destined for\r\ncommissions in the artillery and engineers receive their previous\r\neducation, and under what conditions appointments as officers in these\r\ntwo services are made in France. The regulations for the infantry, the\r\ncavalry, and the marines are of the same description. There are in these\r\nalso the same two ways of obtaining a commission. One, and in these\r\nservices the more usual one, is to rise from the ranks. The other is to\r\npass successfully through the school at St. Cyr. Young men who do not\r\nenter as privates prove their fitness for the rank of officers by going\r\nthrough the course of instruction given, and by passing the examinations\r\nconducted in this, the principal, and putting aside the School of\r\nApplication at Metz, the one Special Military School of the country.\r\n\r\nThe earliest foundation of the kind in France was the Ecole Royale\r\nMilitaire of 1751. Like most other similar institutions of the time, it\r\nwas intended for the young nobility. No one was to be admitted who could\r\nnot prove four generations of _Noblesse_. The pupils were taught free of\r\ncharge, and might enter at eight years old. Already, however, some marks\r\nof competition are to be discerned, as the best mathematicians were to\r\nbe taken for the Artillery and Engineers. Buildings on the Plain of\r\nGrenelle (the same which still stand, occupying one end of the present\r\nChamps de Mars, and retaining, though only used as barracks, their\r\nancient name,) were erected for the purpose. The school continued in\r\nthis form till 1776, when it was dissolved (apparently owing to faults\r\nof discipline,) and replaced by ten Colleges, at Sorrèze, Brienne,\r\nVendôme, and other places, all superintended by ecclesiastics. A new\r\nEcole Royale Militaire, occupying the same buildings as the former, was\r\nadded in 1777.\r\n\r\nThis came to an end in 1787; and the ten colleges were suppressed under\r\nthe Republic. A sort of Camp School on the plain of Sablons took their\r\nplace, when the war had broken out, and lasted about a year under the\r\nname of the Ecole de Mars.\r\n\r\nUnder the Consulate in 1800, the Prytanée Français was founded,\r\nconsisting of four separate Colleges. The name was not long after\r\nchanged to the Prytanée Militaire; and after some time the number was\r\ndiminished, and La Flèche, which had in 1764 received the youngest\r\npupils of the old Royal Military School, became the seat of the sole\r\nremaining establishment; which subsequently sunk to the proportions of a\r\nmere junior preparatory school, and became, in fine, the present\r\nestablishment for military orphans, which still retains the title, and\r\nis called the Prytanée Militaire de la Flèche.\r\n\r\nA _special_ Military School, in the meantime, had been set up at\r\nFontainebleau in 1803, transferred in 1808 to St. Cyr, and thus taking\r\nthe place of the Prytanée Militaire and of its predecessor, the original\r\nEcole Royale Militaire, gradually assumed its present form.[15]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: Founded the Ecole Royale Militaire, 1751. Junior\r\n    pupils transferred to La Flèche, 1764.\r\n\r\n    Suppression of the Ecole Royale Militaire and establishment of ten\r\n    Colleges, 1776.\r\n\r\n    New Ecole Royale Militaire, for the best pupils of the Colleges,\r\n    1777.\r\n\r\n    Suppression of the Colleges and of the Ecole Royale Militaire,\r\n    1787.\r\n\r\n    Foundation of the Ecole de Mars, May 1794.\r\n\r\n    Foundation of the Prytanée Français at Paris, Versailles, St.\r\n    Germain, Fontainebleau, 1800.\r\n\r\n    Foundation of the Ecole Spéciale Militaire at Fountainebleau,\r\n    1803.\r\n\r\n    The four Schools of the Prytanée Français are converted into the\r\n    Prytanée Militaire, 1806; and are transferred to La Flèche, 1808.\r\n\r\n    The Ecole Spéciale Militaire is transferred to St. Cyr, also in\r\n    1808.]\r\n\r\nThe course of study lasts two years; the usual number of cadets in time\r\nof peace is five, or at the utmost six hundred; the admission is by\r\ncompetitive examination, open to all youths, French by birth or by\r\nnaturalization, who on the first of January preceding their candidature\r\nwere not less than sixteen and not more than twenty years old. To this\r\nexamination are also admitted soldiers in the ranks between twenty and\r\ntwenty-five years of age, who, at the date of its commencement, have\r\nbeen actually in service in their regiments for two years.\r\n\r\nThe general conditions and formalities are the same as those already\r\nstated for the Polytechnic. It may be repeated that all the candidates,\r\nin accordance with a recent enactment, must have taken the usual degree\r\nwhich terminates the task at the _lycées_--the baccalaureate in\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\nThose who succeed in the examination and are admitted, take an\r\nengagement to serve seven years either in the cavalry or infantry, and\r\nare thus under the obligation, if they are judged incompetent at the\r\nclose of their two years’ stay at the school to receive a commission, to\r\nenter and serve as common soldiers. The two years of their stay at the\r\nschool counts as a part of their service. It is only in the special case\r\nof loss of time caused by illness, that permission is given to remain a\r\nthird year.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary payment is 60_l._ (1,500 francs) per annum. All whose\r\ninability to pay this amount is satisfactorily established, may claim,\r\nas at the Polytechnic, an allowance of the whole or of half of the\r\nexpenses from the State, to which may be added an allowance for the\r\nwhole or for a portion of the outfit (from 24_l._ to 28_l._) These\r\n_bourses_ or _demi-bourses_, with the _trousseau_, or _demi-trousseau_,\r\nhave during the last few years been granted unsparingly. One-third of\r\nthe 800 young men at the school in February 1856 were _boursiers_ or\r\n_demi-boursiers_. Candidates admitted from the Orphan School of La\r\nFlèche, where the sons of officers wounded or killed in service receive\r\na gratuitous education, are maintained in the same manner here.[16]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: About twenty-five are sent every year from La\r\n    Flèche. The admissions from the army (_i.e._, of soldiers between\r\n    twenty and twenty-five years old) do not amount to more than four\r\n    or at the utmost five per cent. They are very frequently young men\r\n    who have previously failed for St. Cyr, and who then enter the\r\n    army as privates, and come in as such. They have to pass the same\r\n    examination.]\r\n\r\nIt was the rule till lately that cadets appointed, on leaving St. Cyr,\r\nto the cavalry should be placed for two years at the Cavalry School at\r\nSaumur. This, however, has recently been changed; on entering St. Cyr\r\nthose who desire appointments in the cavalry declare their wishes, and\r\nare put at once through a course of training in horsemanship. Those who\r\nare found unfit are quickly withdrawn; the remainder, if their place on\r\nthe final examination allows of their appointment to the cavalry, are by\r\nthat time sufficiently well practiced to be able to join their regiments\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven, or sometimes a greater number, are annually at the close\r\nof their second year of study placed in competition with twenty-five\r\ncandidates from the second lieutenants belonging to the army,[17] if so\r\nmany are forthcoming, for admission to the Staff School at Paris. This\r\nadvantage is one object which serves as a stimulus to exertion, the\r\npermission being given according to rank in the classification by order\r\nof merit.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: Few usually present themselves; and these also, it\r\n    is said, are very generally old _élèves_ of St. Cyr, who had not\r\n    succeeded in obtaining admission to the Staff School before. They\r\n    are not examined _with_ the pupils of St. Cyr, but are\r\n    intercalated in the list according to their merit.]\r\n\r\nThe school consists of two divisions, the upper and the lower,\r\ncorresponding to the two years of the course. Each division is divided\r\nagain into four companies. In each of these eight companies there are\r\nsub-officers chosen from the _élèves_ themselves, with the titles of\r\n_Sergent_, _Sergent Fourrier_, and _Caporal_; those appointed to the\r\ncompanies of the junior division are selected from the second year\r\ncadets, and their superiority in standing appears to give these latter\r\nsome considerable authority, exercised occasionally well, occasionally\r\nill. The whole school, thus divided into eight companies, constitutes\r\none battalion.\r\n\r\nThe establishment for conducting the school consists of--\r\n\r\n  A General as Commandant.\r\n\r\n  A Second in Command (a Colonel of Infantry.)\r\n\r\n  A Major, 4 Captains, 12 Lieutenants, and 5 Second Lieutenants of\r\nInfantry; the Major holding the office of Commandant of the Battalion.\r\n\r\n  A Major, 1 Captain, 34 Lieutenants, and 3 Second Lieutenants of\r\nCavalry to superintend the exercises, the riding, &c.\r\n\r\n  A Director of Studies (at present a Lieutenant-Colonel of Engineers.)\r\n\r\n  Two Assistant Directors.\r\n\r\n  Six Examiners for Admission.\r\n\r\n  One Professor of Artillery.\r\n\r\n  One Assistant ditto.\r\n\r\n  One Professor of Topography and Mathematics.\r\n\r\n  One Professor of Military Administration, Military Art, and Military\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\n  One Professor of Fortification.\r\n\r\n  One Professor of Military Literature.\r\n\r\n  Two Professors of History and Geography.\r\n\r\n  One Professor of Descriptive Geometry.\r\n\r\n  One Professor of Physics and Chemistry.\r\n\r\n  Three Professors of Drawing,\r\n\r\n  One Professor of German.\r\n\r\n  Eleven Military and six Civilian Assistant Teachers (_Répétiteurs_.)\r\n\r\nThere is also a Quartermaster, a Treasurer, a Steward, a Secretary of\r\nthe Archives, who is also Librarian, an Almoner (a clergyman,) four or\r\nfive Surgeons, a Veterinary Surgeon, who gives lessons on the subject,\r\nand twelve Fencing Masters.\r\n\r\nThe professors and teachers are almost entirely military men. Some\r\ndifficulty appears to be found by civilians in keeping sufficient order\r\nin the large classes; and it has been found useful to have as\r\n_répétiteurs_ persons who could also be employed in maintaining\r\ndiscipline in the house. Among the professors at present there are\r\nseveral officers of the engineers and of the artillery, and of the staff\r\ncorps.\r\n\r\nThere is a board or council of instruction, composed of the commandant,\r\nthe second in command, one of the field officers of the school staff,\r\nthe director of studies, one of the assistant directors, and four\r\nprofessors.\r\n\r\nSo, again, the commandant, the second in command, one of the field\r\nofficers, two captains, and two lieutenants, the last four changing\r\nevery year, compose the board or council of discipline.\r\n\r\nSt. Cyr is a little village about three miles beyond the town of\r\nVersailles, and but a short distance from the boundary of the park. The\r\nbuildings occupied by the school are those formerly used by Madame de\r\nMaintenon, and the school which she superintended. Her garden has given\r\nplace for the parade and exercise grounds; the chapel still remains in\r\nuse; and her portrait is preserved in the apartments of the commandant.\r\nThe buildings form several courts or quadrangles; the Court of Rivoli,\r\noccupied chiefly by the apartments and bureaux of the officers of the\r\nestablishment, and terminated by the chapel; the Courts of Austerlitz,\r\nand Marengo, more particularly devoted to the young soldiers themselves;\r\nand that of Wagram, which is incomplete, and opens into the parade\r\ngrounds. These, with the large stables, the new riding school, the\r\nexercising ground for the cavalry, and the polygon for artillery\r\npractice, extend to some little distance beyond the limit of the old\r\ngardens into the open arable land which descends northwards from the\r\nschool, the small village of St. Cyr lying adjacent to it on the south.\r\n\r\nThe ground floor of the buildings forming the Courts of Marengo,\r\nAusterlitz, and Wagram appeared to be occupied by the two refectories,\r\nby the lecture-rooms or amphitheaters, each holding two hundred pupils,\r\nand by the chambers in which the ordinary questionings, similar to those\r\nalready described in the account of the Polytechnic School, under the\r\nname of _interrogations particulières_, are conducted.\r\n\r\nOn the first floor are the _salles d’étude_ and the _salle des\r\ncollections_ the museum or repertory of plans, instruments, models and\r\nmachines, and the library; on the second floor the ordinary dormitories;\r\nand on the third (the attics,) supplementary dormitories to accommodate\r\nthe extra number of pupils who have been admitted since the commencement\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nThe commission, when visiting the school, was conducted on leaving the\r\napartments of the commandant to the nearest of the two refectories. It\r\nwas after one o’clock, and the long room was in the full possession of\r\nthe whole first or junior division. A crowd of active and\r\nspirited-looking young soldiers, four hundred at least in number, were\r\nranged at two long rows of small tables, each large enough, perhaps, for\r\ntwelve; while in the narrow passage extending up and down the room,\r\nbetween the two rows, stood the officers on duty for the maintenance of\r\norder. On passing back to the corridor, the stream of the second year\r\ncadets was issuing from their opposite refectory. In the adjoining\r\nbuttery, the loaf was produced, one kilogramme in weight, which\r\nconstitutes the daily allowance. It is divided into four parts, eaten at\r\nbreakfast, dinner, the afternoon lunch or _gouter_, and the supper. The\r\ndaily cost of each pupil’s food is estimated at 1f. 80c.\r\n\r\nThe lecture rooms and museums offer nothing for special remark. In the\r\nlibrary containing 12,000 books and a fine collection of maps, there\r\nwere a few of the young men, who are admitted during one hour every day.\r\n\r\nThe _salles d’étude_ on the first floor are, in contrast to those at the\r\nPolytechnic, large rooms, containing, under the present circumstances of\r\nthe school, no less than two hundred young men. There are, in all, four\r\nsuch rooms, furnished with rows of desks on each side and overlooked in\r\ntime of study by an officer posted in each to preserve order, and, so\r\nfar as possible, prevent any idleness.\r\n\r\nFrom these another staircase conducts to the dormitories, containing one\r\nhundred each, and named after the battles of the present war--Alma,\r\nInkerman, Balaclava, Bomarsund. They were much in the style of those in\r\nordinary barracks, occupied by rows of small iron beds, each with a\r\nshelf over it, and a box at the side. The young men make their own beds,\r\nclean their own boots, and sweep out the dormitories themselves. Their\r\nclothing, some portions of which we here had the opportunity of\r\nnoticing, is that of the common soldier, the cloth being merely a little\r\nfiner.\r\n\r\nAbove these ordinary dormitories are the attics, now applied to the use\r\nof the additional three hundred whom the school has latterly received.\r\n\r\nThe young men, who had been seen hurrying with their muskets to the\r\nparade ground, were now visible from the upper windows, assembled, and\r\ncommencing their exercises. And when, after passing downwards and\r\nvisiting the stables, which contain three hundred and sixty horses,\r\nattended to by two hundred cavalry soldiers, we found ourselves on the\r\nexercising ground, the cavalry cadets were at drill, part mounted, the\r\nothers going through the lance exercise on foot. In the riding-school a\r\nsquad of infantry cadets were receiving their weekly riding lesson. The\r\ncavalry cadets ride three hours a-day; those of the infantry about one\r\nhour a week. The exercising ground communicates with the parade ground;\r\nhere the greater number of the young men were at infantry drill, under\r\narms. A small squad was at field-gun drill in an adjoining square.\r\nBeyond this and the exercising ground is the practice ground, where\r\nmusket and artillery practice is carried on during the summer. Returning\r\nto the parade ground we found the cadets united into a battalion; they\r\nformed line and went through the manual exercise, and afterwards marched\r\npast; they did their exercise remarkably well. Some had been only three\r\nmonths at the school. The marching past was satisfactory; it was in\r\nthree ranks, in the usual French manner.\r\n\r\nYoung men intended for the cavalry are instructed in infantry and\r\nartillery movements and drill; just as those intended for the infantry\r\nare taught riding, and receive instruction in cavalry, as well as\r\nartillery drill and movements.\r\n\r\nIt is during the second year of their stay they receive most instruction\r\nin the arms of the service to which they are not destined, and this, it\r\nis said, is a most important part of their instruction. “It is this,”\r\nsaid the General Commandant, “that made it practicable, for example, in\r\nthe Crimea, to find among the old _élèves_ of St. Cyr, officers fit for\r\nthe artillery, the engineers, the staff; and for general officers, of\r\ncourse, it is of the greatest advantage to have known from actual study\r\nsomething of every branch.”\r\n\r\nThe ordinary school vacation last six or seven weeks in the year. The\r\nyoung men are not allowed to quit the grounds except on Sundays. On that\r\nday there is mass for the young men.\r\n\r\nThe routine of the day varies considerably with the season. In winter it\r\nis much as follows:--At 5 A.M. the drum beats, the young men quit their\r\nbeds; in twelve minutes they are all dressed and out, and the\r\ndormitories are cleared. The _rappel_ sounds on the _grand carré_; they\r\nform in their companies, enter their _salles_, and prepare for the\r\nlecture of the day until a quarter to 7. At 7 o’clock the officers on\r\nduty for the week enter the dormitories, to which the pupils now return,\r\nat a quarter to 8 the whole body passes muster in the dormitories, in\r\nwhich they have apparently by this time made their beds and restored\r\ncleanliness and order. Breakfast is taken at one time or other during\r\nthe interval between a quarter to 7 and 8 o’clock.\r\n\r\nThey march to their lecture rooms at 8, the lecture lasts till a quarter\r\npast 9, when they are in like manner marched out, and are allowed a\r\nquarter of an hour of amusement. They then enter the halls of study,\r\nmake up their notes on the lecture they have come from, and after an\r\nhour and a half employed in this way, for another hour and a half are\r\nset to drawing.\r\n\r\nDinner at 1 is followed by recreation till 2. Two hours from 2 to a\r\nquarter past 4 are devoted to military services.\r\n\r\nFrom 4 to 6 P.M. part are occupied in study of the drill-book\r\n(_théorie_,) part in riding or fencing: a quarter of an hour’s\r\nrecreation follows, and from 6¼ to 8½ there are two hours of study in\r\nthe _salles_. At half-past 8 the day concludes with the supper.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives a view of the routine in summer:--\r\n\r\n   4½ A.M. to 4¾  A.M. Dressing.\r\n   4¾  “   to 7¼   “   Military exercises.\r\n   7¼  “   to 8¼   “   Breakfast, cleaning, inspection.\r\n   8¼  “   to 9½   “   Lecture.\r\n   9½  “   to 9¾   “   Recreation.\r\n   9¾  “   to 11¼  “   Study.\r\n  11¼  “   to 1   P.M. Drawing.\r\n   1  P.M. to 2    “   Dinner and recreation.\r\n   2   “   to 4    “   Study of drill-book (_théorie_) or fencing.\r\n   4   “   to 6    “   Study for some, riding for others.\r\n   6   “   to 6¼   “   Recreation.\r\n   6¼  “   to 8    “   Riding for some, study for others,\r\n   8   “   to 8½   “   Supper.\r\n\r\nThe entrance examination is much less severe than that for the\r\nPolytechnic; but a moderate amount of mathematical knowledge is\r\ndemanded, and is obtained. The candidates are numerous; and if it be\r\ntrue that some young men of fortune shrink from a test, which, even in\r\nthe easiest times, exacts a knowledge of the elements of trigonometry,\r\nand not unfrequently seek their commissions by entering the ranks, their\r\nplace is supplied by youths who have their fortunes to make, and who\r\nhave intelligence, industry, and opportunity enough to acquire in the\r\nordinary _lycées_, the needful amount of knowledge.\r\n\r\nUnder present circumstances it is, perhaps, more especially in the\r\npreparatory studies that the intellectual training is given, and for the\r\nexamination of admission that theoretical attainments are demanded. The\r\nstate of the school in a time of war can not exactly be regarded as a\r\nnormal or usual one. The time of stay has been sometimes shortened from\r\ntwo years to fifteen months; the excessive numbers render it difficult\r\nto adjust the lectures and general instruction so as to meet the needs\r\nof all; the lecture rooms and the studying rooms are all insufficient\r\nfor the emergency; and what is yet more than all, the stimulus for\r\nexertion, which is given by the fear of being excluded upon the final\r\nexamination, and sent to serve in the ranks, is removed at a time when\r\nalmost every one may feel sure that a commission which must be filled up\r\nwill be vacant for him. Yet even in time of peace, if general report may\r\nbe trusted, it is more the drill, exercises, and discipline, than the\r\ntheory of military operations, that excite the interest and command the\r\nattention of the young men. When they leave, they will take their places\r\nas second lieutenants with the troops, and they naturally do not wish to\r\nbe put to shame by showing ignorance of the common things with which\r\ncommon soldiers are familiar. Their chief incentive is the fear of being\r\nfound deficient when they join their regiments, and, with the exception\r\nof those who desire to enter the staff corps, their great object is the\r\npractical knowledge of the ordinary matters of military duty. “Physical\r\nexercises,” said the Director of Studies, “predominate here as much as\r\nintellectual studies do at the Polytechnic.”\r\n\r\nBut the competition for entrance sustains the general standard of\r\nknowledge. Even when there is the greatest demand for admissible\r\ncandidates, the standard of admission has not, we are told, been much\r\nreduced. No one comes in who does not know the first elements of\r\ntrigonometry. And the time allotted by the rules of the school to\r\nlectures and indoor study is far from inconsiderable.\r\n\r\nEXAMINATIONS FOR ADMISSION--STUDIES AT THE SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nThe examinations for admission are conducted almost precisely upon the\r\nsame system which is now used in those for the Polytechnic School.[18]\r\nThere is a preliminary or pass examination (_du premier degré_), and for\r\nthose who pass this a second or class examination (_du second degré_.)\r\nFor the former there are three examiners, two for mathematics, physics,\r\nand chemistry, and a third for history, geography, and German. The\r\nsecond examination, which follows a few days after, is conducted in like\r\nmanner by three examiners. A jury of admission decides. The examination\r\nis for the most part oral; and the principal difference between it and\r\nthe examination for the Polytechnic is merely that the written papers\r\nare worked some considerable time before the first oral examination\r\n(_du premier degré_,) and are looked over with a view to assist the\r\ndecision as to admissibility to the second (_du second degré_.) Thus the\r\n_compositions écrites_ are completed on the 14th and 15th of June; the\r\npreliminary examination commences at Paris on the 10th of July; the\r\nsecond examination on the 13th.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: The system was, in fact, first tried at St. Cyr, and\r\n    adopted, on the representation of the Mixed Commission, at the\r\n    Polytechnic. The previous method, by which different sets of\r\n    examiners took different districts, had created distrust and\r\n    dissatisfaction.]\r\n\r\nThe subjects of examination are the following:--\r\n\r\n  _Arithmetic_, including vulgar and decimal fractions, weights and\r\nmeasures, square and cube root, ratios and proportions, interest and\r\ndiscount, use of logarithmic tables and the sliding rule.\r\n\r\n  _Algebra_, to quadratic equations with one unknown quantity, maxima\r\nand minima, arithmetical and geometrical progressions, logarithms and\r\ntheir application to questions of compound interest and annuities.\r\n\r\n  _Geometry_, plane and solid, including the measurement of areas,\r\nsurfaces, and volumes; sections of the cone, cylinder, and sphere.\r\n\r\n  _Plane Trigonometry:_ construction of trigonometrical tables and the\r\nsolution of triangles; application to problems required in surveying.\r\n\r\n  _Geometrical representations_ of bodies by projections.\r\n\r\n  _French_ compositions.\r\n\r\n  _German_ exercises.\r\n\r\n  _Drawing_, including elementary geometrical drawing and projections;\r\nplan, section, and elevation of a building; geographical maps.\r\n\r\n  _Physical Science_ (purely descriptive:) cosmography; physics,\r\nincluding elementary knowledge of the equilibrium of fluids; weight,\r\ngravity, atmospheric pressure, heat, electricity, magnetism, acoustics,\r\noptics, refraction, microscope, telescope.\r\n\r\n  _Chemistry_, elementary principles of; on matter, cohesion, affinity;\r\nsimple and compound bodies, acids, bases, salts, oxygen, combustion,\r\nazote, atmospheric air, hydrogen, water; respecting equivalents and\r\ntheir use, carbon, carbonic acid, production and decomposition of\r\nammonia, sulphur, sulphuric acid, phosphorus, chlorine; classification\r\nof non-metallic bodies into four families.\r\n\r\n  _History:_ History of France from the time of Charles VII. to that of\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon I. and the treaties of 1815.\r\n\r\n  _Geography_, relating entirely to France and its colonies, both\r\nphysical and statistical.\r\n\r\n  _German:_ the candidates must be able to read fluently both the\r\nwritten and printed German character, and to reply in German to simple\r\nquestions addressed to them in the same language.\r\n\r\nThe general system of instruction at St. Cyr is similar to that of the\r\nPolytechnic; the lectures are given by the professors, notes are taken\r\nand completed afterwards, and progress is tested in occasional\r\n_interrogations_ by the _répétiteurs_. One distinction is the different\r\nsize of the _salles d’étude_ (containing two hundred instead of eight or\r\nten;) but, above all, is the great and predominant attention paid to the\r\npractical part of military teaching and training. It is evident at the\r\nfirst sight that this is essentially a military school, and that\r\nespecial importance is attached both by teachers and pupils to the\r\ndrill, exercise, and manœuvers of the various arms of the service.\r\n\r\nThe course of study is completed in two years; that of the first year\r\nconsists of:--\r\n\r\n          27 lectures in descriptive geometry.\r\n          35     “       physical science.\r\n          20     “       military literature.\r\n          35     “       history.\r\n          21     “       geography and military statistics.\r\n          30     “       German.\r\n         ---\r\n  Total, 174\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, there is a course of drawing between the time\r\nwhen the students join the school early in November and the 15th of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n  The course of _drawing_ consists in progressive studies of landscape\r\ndrawing with the pencil and brush, having special application to\r\nmilitary subjects, to the shading of some simple body or dress, and to\r\nenable the students to apply the knowledge which has been communicated\r\nto them on the subject of shadows and perspective. This course is\r\nfollowed by the second or junior division during the first year’s\r\nresidence.\r\n\r\n  The course of lectures in _descriptive geometry_ commences with\r\ncertain preliminary notions on the subject; refers to the representation\r\nof lines on curved surfaces, cylindrical and conical, surfaces of\r\nrevolutions, regular surfaces, intersection of surfaces, shadows,\r\nperspective, vanishing points, &c., construction of geographical maps,\r\nand _plan côté_.\r\n\r\n  The lectures in _physical science_ embrace nine lectures on the\r\ngeneral properties of bodies; heat, climate, electricity, magnetism,\r\ngalvanism, electro-magnetism, acoustics.\r\n\r\n  There are twelve lectures in _chemistry_; on water, atmospheric air,\r\ncombustibles, gas, principal salts, saltpetre, metallurgy, organic\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\n  There are fourteen lectures in _mechanics applied to machines_;\r\nmotion, rest, gravity, composition and resolution of forces, mechanical\r\nlabor, uniform motion, rectilinear and rotatory, projectiles in space,\r\nmechanical powers, drawbridges, Archimedean principle, military bridges,\r\npumps, reservoirs, over and under-shot wheels, turbines, corn mills,\r\nsteam-engines, locomotives, transport of troops, materials, and\r\nmunitions on railways.\r\n\r\n  The twenty lectures in _military literature_ refer to military history\r\nand biography, memoirs of military historians, battles and sieges, the\r\nart of war, military correspondence, proclamations, bulletins, orders of\r\nthe day, instructions, circulars, reports and military considerations,\r\nspecial memoirs, reconnaissance and reports, military and periodical\r\ncollections, military justice.\r\n\r\n  The thirty-five lectures in _history_ principally relate to France and\r\nits wars, commencing with the Treaty of Westphalia and ending with the\r\nTreaty of Vienna.\r\n\r\n  The twenty-seven lectures in _geography_ and _military statistics_ are\r\nsubdivided into different parts; the first eight lectures are devoted to\r\nEurope and France, including the physical geography and statistics of\r\nthe same; the second six lectures are devoted to the frontiers of\r\nFrance; and the third part of thirteen lectures to foreign states and\r\nAlgeria, including Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Poland, and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe studies for the first division during the second year of their\r\nresidence consist of--\r\n\r\n          10 lectures in topography.\r\n          27     “       fortification.\r\n          15     “       artillery.\r\n          10     “       military legislation.\r\n          12     “       military administration.\r\n          27     “       military art and history.\r\n          20     “       German.\r\n         ---\r\n  Total, 121\r\n\r\nOne lesson weekly is given in drawing, in order to render the students\r\nexpert in landscape and military drawing with the pencil, pen, and\r\nbrash.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to call attention to the fact that mathematics are not\r\ntaught in either yearly course at St. Cyr.\r\n\r\n  The course in _topography_, of ten lectures, has reference to the\r\nconstruction of maps, copies of drawings, theory, description, and use\r\nof instruments for measuring angles and leveling, the execution for a\r\nregular survey on the different systems of military drawing, drawing\r\nfrom models of ground, on the construction of topographical drawing and\r\nreconnaissance surveys, with accompanying memoirs.\r\n\r\n  Twenty-seven lectures are devoted to _fortification_; the first\r\nthirteen relate principally to field fortification, statement of the\r\ngeneral principles, definitions, intrenchments, lines, redoubts,\r\narmament, defilement, execution of works on the ground, means necessary\r\nfor the defense, application of field fortification to the defenses of\r\n_têtes de pont_ and inhabited places, attack and defense of\r\nintrenchments, &c., castramentation; six lectures have reference to\r\npermanent fortification, on ancient fortifications, Cormontaigne’s\r\nsystem, exterior and detached works, considerations respecting the\r\naccessories of defense to fortified places; eight lectures relate to the\r\nattack and defense of places, preparations for attack and defense,\r\ndetails of the construction of siege works from the opening of the\r\ntrenches to the taking of the place, exterior works, as auxiliaries,\r\nsketches, and details of the different works in fortifications, plans,\r\nand profile, &c.\r\n\r\n  The students also execute certain works, such as the making of\r\nfascines, gabions, saucissons, repair of revetments of batteries,\r\nplatform, setting the profiles, defilement, and construction of a\r\nfieldwork, different kinds of sap, plan and establishment of a camp for\r\na battalion of infantry, &c.\r\n\r\n  Under the head of _artillery_, fifteen lectures are given, commencing\r\nwith the resistance of fluids, movement of projectiles, solution of\r\nproblems with the balistic pendulum, deviation of projectiles, pointing\r\nand firing guns; small arms, cannon, materials of artillery, powder,\r\nmunition, fireworks for military purposes; range of cannon, artillery\r\nfor the attack or defense of places or coasts, field artillery, military\r\nbridges.\r\n\r\n  The students are practically taught artillery drill with field and\r\nsiege guns, practice with artillery, repair of siege batteries, bridges\r\nof boats or rafts.\r\n\r\n  The ten lectures allowed for the course of _military legislation_ have\r\nfor their object the explanation of the principles, practice, and\r\nregulations relating to military law, and the connection with the civil\r\nlaws that affect military men.\r\n\r\n  The twelve lectures on what is called _military administration_ relate\r\nto the interior economy of a company, and to the various matters\r\nappertaining to the soldier’s messing, mode of payment, necessaries,\r\nequipment, lodging, &c.\r\n\r\n  _Military art and history_ is divided into three parts. The first, of\r\nfive lectures, relates to the history of military institutions and\r\norganization. The second, of fifteen lectures, refers to the composition\r\nof armies and to considerations respecting the various arms, infantry,\r\ncavalry, état-major, artillery and engineers, and the minor operations\r\nof war. The third part, of seven lectures, gives the history of some of\r\nthe most celebrated campaigns in modern times. In the practical\r\nexercises, the students make an attack or defense of a work or of a\r\nsystem of fieldworks during their course of fortification, or of a\r\nhouse, farm, village, in the immediate vicinity of the school, or make\r\nthe passage of a river.\r\n\r\n  The students receive twenty lectures in _German_, and are required to\r\nkeep up a knowledge of German writing.\r\n\r\nEXAMINATIONS AT THE SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nThe examinations at the end of the first year take place under the\r\nsuperintendence of the director and assistant director of studies. They\r\nare conducted by the professor of each branch of study, assisted by a\r\n_répétiteur_, each of whom assigns a credit to the student under\r\nexamination, and the mean, expressed as a whole number, represents the\r\nresult of the student’s examination in that particular branch of study.\r\nThe examination in military instruction for training (in drill and\r\nexercises) is carried on by the officers attached to companies, under\r\nthe superintendence of the commandant of the battalion, and that\r\nrelating to practical artillery by the officer in charge of that duty.\r\n\r\nThe pupils’ position is determined, as at the Polytechnic, partly by the\r\nmarks gained at the examination, partly by those he has obtained during\r\nhis previous studies. In other words, the half of the credit obtained by\r\na student at this examination in each subject is added to the half of\r\nthe mean of all the credits assigned to him, in the same subject, for\r\nthe manner in which he has replied to the questions of the professor and\r\n_répétiteur_ during the year; and the sum of these two items represents\r\nhis total credit at the end of the year. The scale of credit is from 0\r\nto 20, as at the Polytechnic.\r\n\r\nEvery year, before the examinations commence, the commandant and second\r\nin command, in concert with the director and assistant director, and in\r\nconcurrence with the superior officer commanding the battalion for\r\nmilitary instruction, are formed into a board to determine the amount of\r\nthe minimum credit which should be exacted from the students in every\r\nbranch of study. This minimum is not usually allowed to fall below eight\r\nfor the scientific, and ten for the military instruction.\r\n\r\nAny student whose general mean credit is less than _eight_ for the\r\nscientific, or _ten_ for the military instruction, or who has a less\r\ncredit than _four_ for any particular study in the general instruction,\r\nor of _six_ for the military instruction, is retained at the school to\r\nwork during the vacation, and re-examined about eight days before the\r\nre-commencement of the course, by a commission composed of the director\r\nand assistant director of studies for the general instruction, and of\r\nthe second in command and the commandant of the battalion, and of one\r\ncaptain for the military instruction. A statement of this second\r\nexamination is submitted to the minister of war, and those students who\r\npass it in a satisfactory manner are permitted by him to proceed into\r\nthe first division. Those who do not pass it are reported to the\r\nminister of war as deserving of being excluded from the school, unless\r\nthere be any special grounds for excusing them, such as sickness, in\r\nwhich case, when the fact is properly established before the council of\r\ninstruction, they are permitted to repeat the year’s studies.\r\n\r\nIrregularity of conduct is also made a ground for exclusion from the\r\nschool. In order to estimate the credit to be attached to the conduct of\r\na student, all the punishments to which he can be subjected are\r\nconverted into a specific number of days of punishment drill. Thus,\r\n\r\nFor each day confined in the police chamber, 4 days’ punishment drill.\r\n\r\nFor each day confined in the prison, 8 days’ punishment drill.\r\n\r\nThe statement is made out under the presidency of the commandant of the\r\nschool, by the second in command, and the officer in command of the\r\nbattalion. The credits for conduct are expressed in whole numbers in\r\nterms of the scale of 0 to 20, in which the 20 signifies that the\r\nstudent has not been subjected to any punishment whatever, and the 0,\r\nthat the student’s punishments have amounted to 200 or more days of\r\npunishment drill. The number 20 is diminished by deducting 1 for every\r\n10 days of punishment drill.\r\n\r\nThe classification in the order of merit depends upon the total amount\r\nof the sum of the numerical marks or credits obtained by each student in\r\nevery branch of study or instruction. The numerical credit in each\r\nsubject is found by multiplying the credit awarded in each subject by\r\nthe co-efficient of influence belonging to it.\r\n\r\nThe co-efficients, representing the influence allowed to each particular\r\nkind of examination, in the various branches of study are as follows:--\r\n\r\nSecond Division, or First Year’s Course of Study.\r\n\r\n  General Instruction.\r\n    { Descriptive Geometry,                           6 }\r\n    {   { Course,                                     6 }\r\n    {   { Drawing and Sketches,                       2 }\r\n    { Physical Science applied to the Military Arts,  6 }\r\n    {   { Course,                                     6 }\r\n    {   { Sketch and Memoir,                          2 }\r\n    { History,                                        6 }\r\n    { Geography and Statistical Memoirs,              5 }\r\n    {   { Course,                                     5 }\r\n    {   { Sketch and Memoir,                          2 }\r\n    { Literature, Memoir on                           4 }\r\n    { German,                                         4 }\r\n    { Drawing,                                        3 } 40\r\n  Special Instruction:--Drill, Practice, Manœuvers\r\n    (Infantry and Cavalry,)                                7\r\n  Conduct,                                                 3\r\n                                                          --\r\n                                                          50\r\n\r\nFirst Division, or Second Year’s Course of Study\r\n\r\n  General Instruction.\r\n                                              Infantry.

and\r\n  The third relating to the conduct;\r\n\r\nand they respectively contain, one column in which the names of the\r\nstudents are arranged by companies in the order in which they have been\r\nexamined; followed by as many columns as there are subjects of\r\nexamination, for the insertion of their individual credit and the\r\nco-efficient of influence, by which each credit is multiplied; and\r\nlastly by a column containing the sum of the various products belonging\r\nto, and placed opposite each student’s name.\r\n\r\nThese tables are respectively completed by the aid of the existing\r\ndocuments, the first for the general instruction, by the director of\r\nstudies; the second for the military instruction, by the officer\r\ncommanding the battalion; the third for conduct, under the direction of\r\nthe commandant of the school, assisted by the second in command.\r\n\r\nA jury formed within the school, composed of the general commandant,\r\npresident, the second in command, the director of studies, and the\r\nofficer commanding the battalion, is charged with the classification of\r\nthe students in the order of merit.\r\n\r\nTo effect it, after having verified and established the accuracy of the\r\nabove tables, the numbers appertaining to each student in the three\r\ntables are extracted and inserted in another table, containing the name\r\nof each student, and, in three separate columns, the numbers obtained by\r\neach in general instruction, military instruction, and conduct, and the\r\nsum of these credits in another column.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of this last table, the jury cause another to be compiled, in\r\nwhich the students are arranged in the order of merit as established by\r\nthe numerical amount of their credits, the highest in the list having\r\nthe greatest number.\r\n\r\nIf there should be any two or more having the same number of total\r\ncredits, the priority is determined by giving it to the student who has\r\nobtained a superiority of credits in military instruction, conduct,\r\ngeneral instruction, notes for the year; and if these prove\r\ninsufficient, they are finally classed in the same order as they were\r\nadmitted into the school.\r\n\r\nA list for passing from the second to the first division is forwarded to\r\nthe minister at war, with a report in which the results for the year are\r\ncompared with the results of the preceding year; and the minister at\r\nwar, with these reports before him, decides who are ineligible from\r\nincompetency, or by reason of their conduct, to pass to the other\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nThe period when the final examinations before leaving the school are to\r\ncommence, is fixed by the president of the jury, specially appointed to\r\ncarry on this final examination, in concert with the general commandant\r\nof the school.\r\n\r\nThe president of the jury directs and superintends the whole of the\r\narrangements for conducting the examination; and during each kind of\r\nexamination, a member of the corps, upon the science of which the\r\nstudent is being questioned, assists the examiner, and, as regards the\r\nmilitary instruction, each examiner is aided by a captain belonging to\r\nthe battalion.\r\n\r\nThe examination is carried on in precisely the same manner as that\r\nalready described for the end of the first year’s course of study. And\r\nthe final classification is ascertained by adding to the _numerical_\r\ncredits obtained by each student during his second year’s course of\r\nstudy, in the manner already fully explained, _one-tenth_ of the\r\nnumerical credits obtained at the examinations at the end of the first\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe same regulations as to the minimum credit which a student must\r\nobtain in order to pass from one division to the other, at the end of\r\nthe first year, which are stated in page 160, are equally applicable to\r\nhis passing from the school to become a second lieutenant in the army.\r\n\r\nA list of the names of those students who are found qualified for the\r\nrank of second lieutenant is sent to the minister at war, and a second\r\nlist is also sent, containing the names of those students that have,\r\nwhen subjected to a second or revised examination, been pronounced by\r\nthe jury before whom they were re-examined as qualified.\r\n\r\nThose whose names appear in the first list are permitted to choose\r\naccording to their position in the order of merit, the staff corps or\r\ninfantry, according to the number required for the first named service,\r\nand to name the regiments of infantry in which they desire to serve.\r\n\r\nThose intended for the cavalry are placed at the disposal of the officer\r\ncommanding the regiment which they wish to enter.\r\n\r\nThose whose names appear in the second list are not permitted to choose\r\ntheir corps, but are placed by the minister at war in such corps as may\r\nhave vacancies in it, or where he may think proper.\r\n\r\nThe students who are selected to enter the staff corps, after competing\r\nsuccessfully with the second lieutenants of the army, proceed as second\r\nlieutenants to the staff school at Paris. Those who fail pass into the\r\narmy as privates, according to the terms of the engagement made on\r\nentering the school.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAVALRY SCHOOL AT SAUMUR.\r\n\r\nThis school was established in 1826, and is considered[19] the most\r\nperfect and extensive institution of the kind in Europe,--perhaps the\r\nonly one really deserving the title, the others being more properly mere\r\nschools of equitation.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: “Report of Observations in Europe during the Crimean\r\n    War,” by Major Gen. McClellan.]\r\n\r\nIt is under the control of the Minister of War, and was established for\r\nthe purpose of perfecting the officers of the cavalry corps in all the\r\nbranches of knowledge necessary to their efficiency, and especially in\r\nthe principles of equitation,--and to diffuse through the corps a\r\nuniform system of instruction, by training up a body of instructors and\r\nclasses of recruits intended for the cavalry service.\r\n\r\nThe instruction is entirely military, and is based upon the laws and\r\nregulations in force with regard to the mounted troops. It includes;\r\n1st. The regulations for interior service; 2nd. The cavalry tactics;\r\n3rd. The regulations for garrison service; 4th. The regulations for\r\nfield service applied, as far as possible, on the ground, especially\r\nwith regard to reconnaissances; 5th. A military and didactic course of\r\nequitation, comprising all the theoretical and practical knowledge\r\nrequired for the proper and useful employment of the horse, his\r\nbreaking, application to the purposes of war, and various civil\r\nexercises; 6th. A course of hippology, having for its object practical\r\ninstruction, by means of the model breeding-stud attached to the school,\r\nin the principles which should serve as rules in crossing breeds and in\r\nraising colts, to explain the phases of dentition, to point out the\r\nconformation of the colt which indicates that he will become a good and\r\nsolid horse, the method to be pursued to bring the colt under subjection\r\nwithout resistance, and, finally, to familiarize the officers and pupils\r\nwith all the knowledge indispensable to an officer charged with the\r\npurchase and care of remount horses. This course includes also a\r\nknowledge of horse-equipment, illustrated in the saddle factory\r\nconnected with the school; 7th. Vaulting, fencing, and swimming. The\r\nnon-commissioned officers are also instructed in the theory of\r\nadministration and accountability. The course of instruction continues\r\none year, commencing in the month of October. The pupils at the school\r\nare:--\r\n\r\n  1st. A division of lieutenants, (_lieutenants instructeurs_.)\r\n  2nd.      “     of sub-lieutenants,\r\n                     (_sous-lieutenants d’instruction_.)\r\n  3rd.      “     of sub-officers,\r\n                     (_sous-officiers élèves instructeurs_.)\r\n  4th.      “     of non-commissioned officers, (_brigadiers élèves_.)\r\n  5th.      “     of cavalry recruits, (_cavaliers élèves_.)\r\n\r\nThe lieutenants are chosen out of the regiments of cavalry and\r\nartillery, as well as from the squadrons of the park-trains and military\r\nequipages, from the lieutenants who voluntarily present themselves for\r\nthe appointment to the General Board of Inspectors. Their age must not\r\nexceed thirty-six years.\r\n\r\nThe sub-lieutenants are appointed from the cavalry regiments, must be\r\ngraduates of the Special Military School, not above thirty-four years of\r\nage, and have served at least one year with the regiment.\r\n\r\nThe sub-officers are selected from the cavalry corps--one from every two\r\nregiments of cavalry and artillery, and every two squadrons of the\r\npark-trains and military equipages.\r\n\r\nThe non-commissioned officers are chosen annually by the\r\ninspectors-general--one from each regiment of cavalry:--from among those\r\nthat show a peculiar aptness for equitation and are distinguished by\r\ngood conduct, information, zeal, and intelligence; those who are\r\nrecommended for promotion in their corps are selected in preference.\r\nTheir age must not exceed twenty-five years, and they must have served\r\nat least one year in the ranks.\r\n\r\nThese pupils, numbering about four hundred, are sent to the school by\r\norder of the Minister of War. They continue connected with their corps,\r\nfrom which they are regarded as detached while they remain at the\r\nschool. They receive additional pay. Those who after due trial are found\r\ndeficient in the necessary qualifications, are sent back to their\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nUpon the recommendation of the inspector-general of the school, the\r\nofficers who are serving as pupils, compete for promotion by choice with\r\nthe officers of the corps from which they are detached.\r\n\r\nThe cavalry lieutenant, who graduates first in his class, is presented\r\nfor the first vacancy as captain-instructor that occurs in the cavalry,\r\nprovided he has the seniority of rank required by law. The lieutenant\r\nwho graduates second obtains, under the same condition, the second\r\nvacancy of captain-instructor, provided his division consisted of more\r\nthan thirty members. The sub-lieutenant graduating first, provided he is\r\nnot lower than the tenth in the general classification of the officers\r\nof both grades, is presented for promotion to the first vacant\r\nlieutenancy that occurs in his regiment.\r\n\r\nThe non-commissioned officers who pass a satisfactory final examination,\r\nare immediately promoted to vacancies that have been preserved for them\r\nin their regiments--those who have graduated among the first ten of the\r\nclass, being presented for promotion as sub-lieutenants, as soon as they\r\nhave completed their required term of service as non-commissioned\r\nofficers. Those who attend the school as non-commissioned officers,\r\nfrequently return as officers for instruction, and again in a higher\r\ngrade on the staff of the school.\r\n\r\nOfficers transferred from the infantry to the cavalry are generally sent\r\nto this school for a short time at least. The captains-instructor of the\r\ncavalry regiments, and the instructors of equitation in the artillery\r\nregiments, are mostly selected from the graduates.\r\n\r\nThe school also receives by voluntary enlistment, such young men, not\r\nabove the age of twenty-one years, as desire to enter the cavalry\r\nservice. They are not admitted until they have been subjected to an\r\nexamination before a committee, by whom they are classified according to\r\ntheir fitness. These volunteer enlistments for the cavalry school are\r\nmade at Saumur, at least a month before the commencement of the course,\r\non presentation of the certificate of classification and of approval by\r\nthe commandant of the school. The number is limited to fifty each year.\r\n\r\nSuch of these cavalry pupils as are distinguished for diligence and good\r\nconduct and pass a satisfactory final examination are transferred to the\r\nregiments of cavalry, for promotion to the rank of noncommissioned\r\nofficers by their respective colonels. Those who have not been found fit\r\nfor admission are sent back simply as privates.\r\n\r\nA council of instruction is charged with the direction of the studies.\r\nThey propose useful changes, and direct the progress of the studies.\r\nThey are also charged with the examinations.\r\n\r\nThe recitations are by sections of about thirty each. In reciting upon\r\nthe general principles of tactics, equitation, hippology, &c., the\r\nmanner is as in our Military Academy; when reciting upon the movements\r\nin tactics, all the commands and explanations of the instructor to the\r\ntroops are repeated “verbatim et literatim,” and in the tone and pitch\r\nof voice used in the field. Perfect uniformity of tone and manner is\r\nrequired. The object of thus reciting is to teach the pupils the proper\r\ntone and pitch of voice, to accustom them to hear their own voices, and\r\nto enable them to repeat the text literally at this pitch of voice,\r\nwithout hesitation or mistake.\r\n\r\nThe course of hippology includes the structure of the horse, the\r\ncirculation of the blood, organs of respiration, &c., food, working\r\npowers, actions, breeds, manner of taking care of him, ordinary ailments\r\nand remedies, shoeing, lameness, saddling, sore backs, sanitary police,\r\n&c., but does not comprise a complete veterinary course.\r\n\r\nThe practical exercises consist of:--the ordinary riding-hall drill,\r\nincluding vaulting, the “kickers,” &c.; the carrière, or out-door riding\r\nat speed, over hurdles, ditches, &c.; cutting at head; target-practice;\r\nfencing; swimming; the usual military drills; skeleton squadron and\r\nregimental drills; rides in the country; finally, in the summer,\r\nfrequent “carousels” or tilts are held.\r\n\r\nThe veterinary surgeons of the lowest grade are sent here upon their\r\nfirst appointment to receive instruction in equitation, to profit by the\r\nstudy of the model stud, and to learn the routine of their duties with\r\nthe regiments. They form a distinct class.\r\n\r\nIn the _Model Stud_, the number of animals varies. There are usually two\r\nstallions and about twenty mares, (Arabs, English, Norman, &c.,) in\r\naddition to those selected from time to time from among the\r\nriding-animals. Attached to it is a botanical garden, more especially\r\nfor useful and noxious grasses and plants.\r\n\r\n_School for Breaking Young Horses._--The best horses purchased at the\r\nremount dépôts are selected for the officers, and sent to this place to\r\nbe trained. The number is fixed at 100 as a minimum. These, as soon as\r\ntheir education is complete, are sold or given, according to the orders\r\nof the Minister of War, to those officers who need a remount--in\r\npreference, to officers of the general staff and staff corps, those of\r\nthe artillery, and mounted officers of infantry. These officers may also\r\nselect from among the other horses of the school, with the approval of\r\nthe commandant.\r\n\r\n_School of Farriers._--This is attached to the cavalry school, and is\r\nunder the direction of the commandant. It is composed of private\r\nsoldiers who have served at least six months with their regiments, and\r\nare blacksmiths or horse-shoers by trade. There are usually two men from\r\neach mounted regiment. The course lasts two years; it comprises reading,\r\nwriting, arithmetic, equitation, the anatomy of the horse, thorough\r\ninstruction as to all diseases, injuries, and deformities of the foot,\r\nsomething of the veterinary art in general, the selection of metals,\r\nmaking shoes, nails, tools, &c., shoeing horses. The establishment has a\r\nlarge shoeing shop and yard, a recitation-room, museum, and store-rooms.\r\nIn the recitation-room there are skeletons of horses, men, &c., as well\r\nas some admirable specimens of natural preparations in comparative\r\nanatomy, a complete collection of shoeing-tools, specimens of many kinds\r\nof shoes, &c.--_Annuaire de l’Instruction_ 1861, _and_ “_Observations_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL OF APPLICATION FOR THE STAFF.\r\n\r\nAT PARIS.\r\n\r\nDUTIES OF THE FRENCH STAFF.\r\n\r\nThe staff is the center from which issue and to which are addressed all\r\norders and military correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the staff are divided into chiefs of the staff,\r\nsub-chiefs, staff-officers, and aides-de-camp.\r\n\r\nThe colonels and lieutenant-colonels are employed as chiefs of the staff\r\nin the different military districts of France, and in the divisions of\r\nthe army on active service. The ordinary posts of the majors and\r\ncaptains is that of aides-de-camp to general officers.\r\n\r\nWhen several armies are united together under a commander-in-chief, the\r\nchief of the general staff takes temporarily the title of\r\n_Major-Général_, the general officers employed under him that of\r\n_Aide-Major-Général_.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the chief of the staff are to transmit the orders of the\r\ngeneral; to execute those which he receives from him personally, for\r\nfield-works, pitching camps, reconnaissances, visits of posts, &c.; to\r\ncorrespond with the commanding officers of the artillery and the\r\nengineers, and with the commissariat, in order to keep the general\r\nexactly informed of the state of the different branches of the service;\r\nto be constantly in communication with the different corps, so as to be\r\nperfectly master of everything relating to them; to prepare for the\r\ncommander-in-chief and for the minister of war, returns of the strength\r\nand position of the different corps and detachments, reports on marches\r\nand operations, and, in short, every necessary information.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the other officers of different ranks, when it has\r\nnot been made by the minister of war, is regulated by the chief of the\r\ngeneral staff.\r\n\r\nIn every division of the army an officer of the staff is specially\r\ncharged with the office work; the others assist him when necessary, but\r\nthey are more usually employed in general staff duties, in\r\nreconnaissances, drawing plans of ground, missions, the arrangement of\r\ncamps and cantonments, superintending the distribution of the rations,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the staff may further be charged with the direction of\r\nfield-works thrown up to cover camps and cantonments.\r\n\r\nStaff officers of all ranks may be employed on posts and detachments. On\r\nspecial missions they command all other officers of the same rank\r\nemployed with them. When a staff officer is charged with the direction\r\nof an expedition or a reconnaissance, without having the command of the\r\ntroops, the officer in command concerts with him in all the dispositions\r\nit may be necessary to make to ensure the success of the operation.\r\n\r\nThe staff of generals of artillery and of engineers is composed of\r\nofficers of their respective arms.\r\n\r\nThe war depot (_Dépôt de la Guerre_) was founded for the purpose of\r\ncollecting and preserving military historical papers, reconnaissances,\r\nmemoirs, and plans of battles; to preserve plans and MSS. maps useful\r\nfor military purposes, and to have them copied and published.\r\n\r\nIt is divided into two sections--one charged with trigonometrical\r\nsurveying, topography, plan drawing, and engraving; the other with\r\nhistorical composition, military statistics, the care of the library,\r\nthe archives, plans, and maps. Each of these sections is under the\r\ndirection of a colonel of the staff corps, who has under his orders\r\nseveral officers of his corps.\r\n\r\nThe war depot has taken a large share in the preparation of the map of\r\nFrance. The first idea of undertaking this important work dates from\r\n1808. After various delays and difficulties, the trigonometrical survey,\r\nwhich had been for a time suspended, was recommenced in 1818. The work\r\nwas placed under the war depot, intrusted to the corps of geographical\r\nengineers. Since this period the geographical engineers have been\r\nincorporated in the staff corps, by the officers of which the work has\r\nbeen continued. The primary triangulation was finished in 1845; the\r\nsecondary is now finished; the filling in the details will occupy\r\nseveral years to come. The number of officers of the staff corps\r\nemployed on the survey has varied from twenty-six to ninety.\r\n\r\nTHE STAFF CORPS.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the French staff constitute a distinct and separate\r\ncorps, numbering thirty-five colonels, thirty-five lieutenant-colonels,\r\none hundred and ten majors, three hundred and thirty captains, and one\r\nhundred lieutenants. None but officers of this corps can be employed on\r\nthe staff. When, by accident, there is not a sufficient number present,\r\nregimental officers may be temporarily employed, but they return to\r\ntheir regiments as soon as officers of the staff corps arrive to replace\r\nthem. The division of the staff into adjutant-general’s and\r\nquartermaster-general’s department does not exist in the French service.\r\n\r\nThe only means of entering the staff corps is through the Staff School\r\nof Application. Of the fifty student-officers which the School of\r\nApplication usually contains, twenty-five leave annually to enter the\r\nstaff corps, and are replaced by an equal number. Three of these come\r\nfrom the Polytechnic, the remaining twenty-two are selected from thirty\r\npupils of the Military School of St. Cyr, who compete with thirty second\r\nlieutenants of the army, if so many present themselves; but, in general,\r\nthe number of the latter does not exceed four or five.\r\n\r\nThe course of study in the Staff School of Application lasts two years.\r\nThe students have the rank of second lieutenant. On passing the final\r\nexamination they are promoted to the rank of lieutenant; they are then\r\nsent to the infantry to do duty for _two years_, at the expiration of\r\nwhich time they are attached for an equal period to the cavalry. They\r\nmay finally be sent for a year to the artillery or engineers.\r\n\r\nThis routine can not be interrupted except in time of war, and even then\r\nthe lieutenant can not be employed on staff duty until he has completed\r\nhis _two years_ with the infantry. However, officers who have a special\r\naptitude for the science of geodesy or topography, may even earlier be\r\nemployed on the map of France or other similar duty; and, further, two\r\nof the lieutenants, immediately on quitting the Staff School of\r\nApplication, are sent to the war depot (_Dépôt de la Guerre_) to gain a\r\nfamiliarity with trigonometrical operations.\r\n\r\nThe General Officers at their Inspections are required to report\r\nspecially to the Minister of War on the captains and lieutenants of the\r\nstaff corps doing duty with the regiments in their districts, both as to\r\ntheir knowledge of drill and manœuvres, and their acquaintance with the\r\nduties of the staff. They are to require these officers to execute a\r\nmilitary reconnaissance, never allowing more than forty-eight hours for\r\nthe field sketch and its accompanying report.\r\n\r\nOfficers of all arms of the rank of captain or under, are permitted to\r\nexchange with officers of equal rank in the staff corps; but they must\r\npreviously satisfy the conditions of the final examinations of the Staff\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDINGS AND ESTABLISHMENT.\r\n\r\nThe Staff School of Application is situated in Paris, in the Rue de\r\nGrenelle, close to the Invalides. Of the ninety officers attending it,\r\nsixty lodge in the building and thirty out of it, but all take their\r\nmeals in the town. Each has, in general, a room to himself. Servants are\r\nprovided in the proportion of one to about eight rooms. The officers are\r\nforbidden to have private servants.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the school is composed as follows:--\r\n\r\n  The Commandant, a General of Brigade.\r\n\r\n  The Second in Command, Director of the Studies, a Colonel or\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of the Staff Corps.\r\n\r\n  A Major of the Staff Corps, charged with the superintendence of the\r\ninterior economy and the drills and exercises.\r\n\r\n  Three Captains of the same Corps, charged with the details of the\r\ninterior economy of the School, and to assist the Major in the\r\ninstruction of the Officers in their military duties. The Captains are\r\nrequired to take the direction of a portion of the topographical works\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\n  A Medical Officer.\r\n\r\nThirteen Military Professors, or Assistant Professors, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  A Major or Captain, Professor of Applied Descriptive Geometry.\r\n\r\n  A Major or Captain, Professor of Astronomy, Physical Geography, and\r\nStatistics.\r\n\r\n  A Major or Captain, Professor of Geodesy and Topography.\r\n\r\n  A Major or Captain of Engineers, Professor of Fortification.\r\n\r\n  A Major or Captain of Artillery, Professor of the instruction relative\r\nto this arm.\r\n\r\n  A Military Sub-Intendant, Professor of Military Legislation and\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\n  A Major or Captain, Professor of Military Art.\r\n\r\n  A Captain, Assistant Professor of Descriptive Geography; charged also\r\nto assist the Professor of Fortification.\r\n\r\n  A Captain, Assistant Professor of Topography; charged also to assist\r\nthe Professor of Geography.\r\n\r\n  A Major or Captain of Cavalry, Professor of Equitation; he acts under\r\nthe immediate orders of the Major of the College.\r\n\r\n  Two Lieutenants or Second Lieutenants of Cavalry, Assistant Professors\r\nof Equitation.\r\n\r\n  An Officer of Cavalry of the same rank, acting as Paymaster to the\r\nRiding Detachment.\r\n\r\nThe Non-Military Professors are:--\r\n\r\n  Two Professors of Drawing.\r\n\r\n  Two Professors of German.\r\n\r\n  A Professor of Fencing.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and forty-five horses are kept for the use of the\r\nstudent-officers, and eighty-two men belonging to the cavalry to look\r\nafter them.\r\n\r\nBoth the studies and examinations at the Staff School hold an\r\nintermediate place between those of the Polytechnic and St. Cyr, being\r\nless abstract than the former, and higher and more difficult than the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF ADMISSION.--ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the Staff School of Application in France is, as is the\r\ncase in all the French military schools, by means of a competitive\r\nexamination, or, rather, by the results of three distinct examinations,\r\nand by the selection of different sets of successful candidates. _Three_\r\nare taken from the students leaving the Polytechnic, who have an\r\nabsolute right to the three first places in the Staff School, and\r\n_twenty-two_ are selected from the thirty best students leaving St. Cyr,\r\nand an equal number of sub-lieutenants of the line under twenty-five\r\nyears of age, if so many present themselves. The sub-lieutenants must\r\nhave one year of service in that rank, and they must make known their\r\nrequest to be allowed to compete for admission to the Staff School to\r\nthe Inspector General, and, through him, to the Minister of War. It\r\nshould be added, that their number is generally extremely small.\r\n\r\nThe usual number of young officers admitted yearly to the school in time\r\nof peace is twenty-five, but this number is sometimes considerably\r\nexceeded, and we found no less than ninety present. The _three_\r\nPolytechnic students select the Staff School after their final\r\nexamination, and the St. Cyr students make known their desire when the\r\nwhole are examined by a Board of Examiners, and the thirty best are then\r\nselected as competitors for admission into the Staff School of\r\nApplication.\r\n\r\nThe sub-lieutenants also repair to St. Cyr, where they are examined\r\nseparately by the same examiners who have just conducted the examination\r\nof the St. Cyr students, and in the same subjects.\r\n\r\nTheir marks or credits are then compared with those of the St. Cyr\r\npupils; and the relative position of the two sets of candidates is\r\nascertained, and the list of those to be admitted to the School of\r\nApplication determined accordingly.\r\n\r\nThese examinations take place before a Commission of Officers, composed\r\nof,--\r\n\r\n  A Lieutenant-General President, appointed by the Minister of War.\r\n\r\n  The Director or Chief of the Dépôt de la Guerre.\r\n\r\n  The Commandant of the School of Application.\r\n\r\n  Four Colonels or Lieutenant-Colonels of the Staff, appointed by the\r\nMinister of War.\r\n\r\n  A Field Officer chosen from among the Officers employed at the Dépôt\r\nde la Guerre, as permanent Secretary.\r\n\r\nThis Commission is also charged with drawing up and proposing\r\nregulations for the approval of the Minister of War concerning the\r\ninterior organization and the course of study to be followed in the\r\nschool, and to make changes in the programmes for admission and for\r\nleaving the school.\r\n\r\nA very detailed account of the subjects of the entrance examination is\r\ndrawn out, and inserted in the _Journal Militaire_, and the _Moniteur_\r\nevery year. The following are the subjects:--\r\n\r\n  (1.) Trigonometry and Topography.\r\n\r\n  (2.) Regular Topography--the measuring of plane surfaces and leveling.\r\n\r\n  (3.) Irregular Topography, Plane Trigonometry.\r\n\r\n  (4.) Military Art and History, including--\r\n\r\n    (_a._) History of Military Institutions at the chief periods.\r\n\r\n    (_b._) Present composition of the French army.\r\n\r\n    (_c._) Organization of an army in the field.\r\n\r\n    (_d._) History of some of the most memorable campaigns, as those of\r\n1796-97 in Italy, and of 1805 and 1809, in Germany.\r\n\r\n  (5.) Artillery and Science of Projectiles.\r\n\r\n  (6.) Field Fortification and Castremetation.\r\n\r\n  (7.) Permanent Fortification.\r\n\r\n  (8.) Military Legislation.\r\n\r\n  (9.) Military Administration.\r\n\r\n  (10.) Manœuvres.\r\n\r\n  (11.) German Language.\r\n\r\n  (12.) Drawing.\r\n\r\nThe marks assigned and the influence allowed to each of these subjects\r\nare the same as those given in the final examination at St. Cyr. The\r\nentrance examination places the students in order of merit.\r\n\r\nTHE STUDIES.\r\n\r\nAll the details of the teaching are in the hands of a Council of\r\nInstruction, similar to that of the Polytechnic, and consisting of the\r\nGeneral Commandant (President,) the Director of Studies, and three\r\nMilitary Professors, appointed yearly by rotation. Other professors and\r\nassistant professors, or officers of the staff of the school, may be\r\ncalled in to assist the Council, but (except in deciding the list at an\r\nexamination) they have no votes.\r\n\r\nThis council does not interfere directly with the administration, the\r\ncommon work of the school. It draws up, indeed, the list of lectures,\r\nmaking any alterations in them, or in the books to be used which may\r\nseem from time to time desirable. But the officer accountable for the\r\ndaily working of the school is the Director of Studies. His functions\r\nappeared to us to bring him into more constant connection with the\r\npupils than was the case with the director of the Polytechnique. In all\r\nthe schools the General Commandant and the Director of Studies live in\r\nthe establishment; but at the _Ecole d’Application_ and at St. Cyr the\r\ndirector “examines the methods of teaching, and proposes to the Council\r\nof Instruction any modifications or improvements which may raise or\r\nquicken the instruction. He inspects the work of the student-officers,\r\nboth in and out of the school. He keeps a register of the marks given by\r\nthe professors, and at the end of every three months brings the sum of\r\nthem before the General Commandant in a detailed report.” In fact, his\r\nschool functions are not modified, as at the Polytechnic, by a body of\r\nable professors.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, there are fifteen professors, without reckoning those\r\nof equitation, and thirteen of them are officers; but the system of\r\n_Répétiteurs_, which we have seen so influential at the Polytechnic,\r\ndoes not exist here.\r\n\r\nThe hours of work are, in summer, _i.e._ from May to November, from six\r\nto five, and in winter from eight to five, with the exception of one\r\nhour for breakfast and one hour for _étude libre_, which appears to mean\r\nvery little indeed. From seven to nine hours daily may be taken as the\r\namount, but (as is the case with most French schools) there is a\r\nconstant change, not only in the subjects taught but in part of the work\r\nbeing _out_ and part _in_ doors, some really head work, much purely\r\nmanual. There does not appear to be the same intense application as at\r\nthe Polytechnic; indeed, the work for three months in the year is almost\r\nentirely in the open air, consisting in making plans and military\r\nsketches, either in the neighborhood of Paris or in the more distant\r\nparts of the country; eight months are devoted to the in-door studies,\r\none month to the examinations.\r\n\r\nThe in-door studies are entirely conducted in the halls of study\r\n(_Salles d’étude_), in each of which we found parties of twelve or\r\nfifteen students seated. They are inspected constantly by the director\r\nor some of the professors. None of the regular work may be done in\r\nprivate. It seems everywhere a fixed belief in the French Military\r\nSchools that very much would be done idly and ill if done in private.\r\nThis presents a striking contrast to the feeling on the subject in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe severer and preparatory studies of mathematics are supposed to have\r\nbeen completed prior to entrance into the Polytechnic or St. Cyr. Some,\r\nhowever, of the studies of applied science occupy considerable time at\r\nthe School of Application.\r\n\r\nThe following analysis will show the time assigned to each branch:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Astronomy_ occupies 1½ hours weekly for the pupils of the first\r\nyear; afterwards it ceases entirely.\r\n\r\n  2. To _Applied Descriptive Geometry_ a good deal of time is given, but\r\nstill only by the pupils of the first year. 12 hours a week are spent\r\nupon it in the first half year, 10 in the second.\r\n\r\n  3. _Military Topography_ occupies about 10½ hours in the first year, 6\r\nin the second.\r\n\r\n  4. A good deal of time is devoted to _Field Fortifications_. The\r\njunior division, it is true, only begin it in their second half year of\r\nstudy, and then only work at it for 1½ hours weekly. But the senior\r\ndivision are occupied 4½ hours weekly in their first half year, and 7½\r\nhours in their second.\r\n\r\n  5. _The Study of Military Administration and Legislation_ is begun\r\nimmediately upon entrance. It occupies during both years 1½ hours\r\nweekly.\r\n\r\n  6. _Lectures on Military Art and Tactics_ are also given for 1½ hours\r\nweekly during both years, and after hearing these lectures the students\r\nare occasionally required to write a military memoir on a campaign,\r\ndescriptions of reconnaissances, or of fields of battle, and to make\r\nsketches of ground with accompanying reports. This course was noted by\r\nGeneral Foltz, the director of the school, as defective, on the ground\r\nthat it was too difficult to find a teacher for, or indeed to teach\r\nmilitary art; and he thought that lectures on military history, or such\r\nworks as Napoleon’s Memoirs, would be more useful to the pupils.\r\n\r\n  7. _Drawing_ occupies throughout 4½ hours weekly, and great attention\r\nis bestowed upon it. “We were shown a large number of works done by the\r\nyoung officers of the school. To enumerate some of the most\r\nimportant--there were specimens of objects, with shadows; perspective of\r\nthe exterior and interior of buildings, with shadows; perspective views\r\nof country; machinery drawings, plan, section, and elevation; in\r\nfortification, a plan of comparison of a portion of ground with proposed\r\nfield-works for defense; military bridges; reconnaissance, and memoir of\r\na route, with accompanying notes and sketches, done both on foot and on\r\nhorseback; plan of a portion of country made with a compass by parties\r\nof ten, under the direction of a Captain (for this the trigonometrical\r\npoints and distances were furnished, and it was filled up by a minor\r\ntriangulation;) plan of a field of battle, made without points; and a\r\ndescription of the battle.”\r\n\r\nThese drawings were mostly executed with great care, and we were told\r\nthat the course was fully as much as the student could accomplish in two\r\nyears. Some parts of it are done entirely in the _Salle d’étude_;\r\nsketches are made on horseback in the neighborhood of Paris, always\r\nunder the direction of the professors, others again at great distances,\r\nsuch as one at Biarritz last year, and the one on which the pupils are\r\nto be engaged this year, is the line of operations of Wellington from\r\nthe Spanish frontier to Toulouse. The two last kinds of work are roughly\r\nsketched, and finished at Paris. These summer occupations seem to stand\r\nin place of vacations, of which there are none.\r\n\r\n  (1.) To _Fencing_, three hours a week are given throughout.\r\n\r\n  (2.) To the _Cavalry Drill_ two hours weekly in the first division. It\r\nis replaced by _Infantry Drill_ in the second.\r\n\r\nThe studies which none but the senior division pursue are,--\r\n\r\n  (1.) _Artillery_ studies, which occupy 4½ hours weekly.\r\n\r\n  (2.) _Geography_, meaning chiefly the military geography of a country,\r\nwith a few lectures on statistics and political economy; these take 1½\r\nhours weekly.\r\n\r\n  (3.) _Geodesy_, or trigonometrical surveying, also for 1½ hours.\r\n\r\nThe only strictly literary occupation is the study of German for about\r\nthree hours per week during the whole time. We were told that a large\r\nproportion of the pupils unite among themselves to learn English\r\nprivately, but no public course is given.\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMINATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe students have two examinations to go through in each year; the first\r\ncommencing about the first of June, the last in November, and each of\r\nthe first year’s examinations is held before a jury consisting of--\r\n\r\n  (1.) The General Commandant, or the Director of Studies; President.\r\n\r\n  (2.) The Professor of the Course examined in.\r\n\r\n  (3.) Two Officers appointed by the Council of Instruction.\r\n\r\nThe last examination in each year is, of course, the most important,\r\ninasmuch as the passage from the Second or Junior to the First or Senior\r\nDivision, and in part from the Senior into the Staff Corps, is regulated\r\nby the results of these examinations; and the value allowed to the last\r\nexamination in each year is just double of that assigned for the\r\nexaminations in June.\r\n\r\nThe examinations of the first year are confined to the subjects of study\r\nfollowed during that year, viz.:--\r\n\r\nDescriptive Geometry, Astronomy, Topography, Artillery, Fortification,\r\nMilitary Art and Administration, German, Drawing, Register of Notes and\r\nMemoranda.\r\n\r\nThe professors and members of the jury are directed rigorously to\r\nconform themselves to the following scale as regards the marks or\r\ncredits they award for the oral answers, graphical representations, &c.\r\n\r\n   0 to  4 bad.\r\n   5 to 10 passable.\r\n  10 to 13 fair.\r\n  14 to 18 good.\r\n  19 to 20 very good.\r\n\r\nThe Co-efficients of influence of the various studies of the first year\r\nare as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Descriptive Geometry,\r\n    { Theory,                       4 }\r\n    { Geographical Representation,  3 }\r\n    { Drawing of Machines,          1 }\r\n    {   { Memoir,                   1 }\r\n    {   { Drawing,                  1 }  9\r\n  Astronomy\r\n    { Theory,                       4 }\r\n    { Graphical Representation,     1 }  5\r\n  Topography\r\n    { Theory,                       4 }\r\n    { Graphical Representation,    *6 } 10\r\n  Artillery,                             4\r\n  Fortification\r\n    { Theory,                       4 }\r\n    { Graphical Representation,     2 }  8\r\n    { Memoirs,                      2 }\r\n  Military Art\r\n    { Theory,                       4 }\r\n    { Memoirs,                        }\r\n    {   { On various questions,     1 }\r\n    {   { On surveys,               2 }  7\r\n  Military Administration,\r\n    { Theory,                       4 }\r\n    { Memoirs,                      1 }  5\r\n  Manœuvres,                             2\r\n  German,                                4\r\n  Drawing,                               2\r\n  Keeping of Memorandum Books,           1\r\n  Conduct and Discipline,                1\r\n  Riding and Knowledge of the Horse,     2\r\n    { Riding,\r\n    { Hippology,\r\n                                        --\r\n       Total,                           60\r\n\r\n  * Subdivision of the Co-efficients of the Graphical Representations.\r\n\r\n    Survey with compass,                  1  }\r\n    Rapid sketch,                         1½ }\r\n    Itinery of the first survey,  }       1½ }\r\n    Itinery of the second survey, }          }\r\n    First Topographical Drawing,           ½ }\r\n     { Second, with relief,                ¾ }\r\n     { Third, on the scale of 1/20000      ¾ } 6\r\n\r\nAs soon as the examinations are concluded, the Council of Instruction,\r\nprepares a provisory classified list of the students, made out in order\r\nof merit from the credits or marks awarded by the Examining Jury in\r\nconnection with the above-mentioned co-efficients of influence, in a\r\nsimilar manner to that already explained in the account of the\r\nPolytechnic School, the student with the largest numerical credit being\r\nplaced at the head of the list.\r\n\r\nThis provisory list is submitted to the Consulting Committee of the\r\nStaff Corps for transmission to the Minister of War.\r\n\r\nIn order to pass from the Second or Junior into the First or Senior\r\nDivision, every Student Officer must have obtained the following marks\r\nor credits from the Jury, viz.:--\r\n\r\nIn Astronomy and Geometry, six out of twenty in each.\r\n\r\nIn all other branches of theoretical instruction, four out of twenty.\r\n\r\nIn the classification of the graphical representations in topography, a\r\nmean of eight out of twenty, and in each of the other courses a mean of\r\nsix out of twenty; and as the general result of his various works and of\r\nhis examinations (the mean of the year being combined with the number\r\nobtained before the jury in the proportion adopted by the Council of\r\nInstruction,) he must have obtained a number of credits equal to\r\none-half of the maximum (1,200.)[20]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: There must be some error in the printed regulations\r\n    on the subject.]\r\n\r\nEvery Student Officer who in his oral examination before the Jury has\r\nfailed in obtaining the minimum stated above is subjected to a fresh\r\nproof before the Consulting Committee of the Staff Corps, and if this is\r\nnot favorable to him he ceases to belong to the school, and must return\r\nto his regiment, unless such failure can be attributed to an illness of\r\nforty-five days, in which case he may be permitted to double his first\r\nyear’s course of study.\r\n\r\nIf the second proof be favorable he is retained at the school, but\r\nplaced at the bottom of the classified lists prepared by the Council of\r\nInstruction.\r\n\r\nThe co-efficients of influence for the second year are--\r\n\r\n                                   Subdivision of the Co-efficients\r\n                                   of the Graphical Representations, &c.\r\n\r\n  Geography and Statistics,\r\n     { Theory,                            4 }  5\r\n     { Memoir,                            1 }\r\n  Geodesy and Topography,\r\n    { Theory                              4 }\r\n    { Geographical Representation,        6 } 10\r\n        { Survey with the Compass,                  1  }\r\n        { Reconnaissance,                           1½ }\r\n        { Itinerary of the first survey,  }            }\r\n        { Itinerary of the reconnaissance }         1½ }\r\n        { Drawing of a Fortress and its Environs,   1½ }\r\n        { Reduction of the Drawings,                 ½ } 6\r\n\r\n  Artillery,\r\n    { Theory,                            4  }\r\n    { Graphical Representation,          3  }\r\n    { Memoirs,                           1  }  8\r\n        { First Drawing of a Military Bridge,       1  }\r\n        {   Second ditto,                            ½ }\r\n        { Breaching Battery                          ½ }\r\n        { Drawing of Artillery Carriage,            1  } 3\r\n\r\n  Fortification,\r\n    { Theory,                            4  }\r\n    { Graphical Representation,          3  }\r\n    { Memoir on a Fortified place,       2½ }\r\n    { Memoir on a Project of Field\r\n    {   Fortification,                   1½ } 11\r\n         { Defilement,                              1 }\r\n         { Project of Fortification,                2 }  3\r\n\r\n  Military Administration,\r\n    { Theory                             4  }  4\r\n\r\n  Military Art\r\n    { Theory                             4  }\r\n    { Memoir on various questions comprised\r\n    {   in drawing up a memoir,          2  }\r\n    { Memoir on the survey with a Compass,\r\n    {   or sketch reconnaissance         2  }  8\r\n\r\n  Manœuvres,                                   3\r\n  German,                                      4\r\n  Drawing,                                     2\r\n  Keeping of Note Books,                       1\r\n  Conduct and Discipline,                      1\r\n\r\n  Riding and Knowledge of the Horse,           3\r\n      { Riding,                                     2  }\r\n      { Veterinary Art,                             1  } 3\r\n                                              --\r\n                      Total                   60\r\n\r\nThe examinations of the students of the Senior or First Division is made\r\nin a similar manner to that already described for the Junior Division,\r\nbut after they are concluded, and prior to these students being admitted\r\ninto the Staff Corps, they are subjected to another examination before\r\nthe Consulting Committee of the Staff Corps, consisting of--\r\n\r\n  3 Generals of Division on the Staff.\r\n  3 Generals of Brigade.\r\n  3 Colonels of the Staff.\r\n  5 Lieutenant-Colonels, including the Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe professors belonging to the school may be called in to assist at\r\nthis examination, and when it is concluded the Consulting Committee\r\nproceeds to the definitive classification of the Student Officers of the\r\nFirst Division by causing the following documents to be placed before\r\nthem, viz.:--\r\n\r\nThe register of the notes of each Student Officer.\r\n\r\nTables of the value of their work; the classified list of passage to the\r\nFirst Division, and the provisionary list for leaving, recently prepared\r\nby the Council of Instruction. The numerical credits obtained in these\r\ntwo classifications are added (each sum being halved) to the definitive\r\nclassification prepared by the committee. The total is divided by two,\r\nin order not to exceed the regulated limit of 1,200 credits for the\r\nmaximum.\r\n\r\nEvery Student Officer who, in this examination for leaving, has not\r\nobtained the half of the maximum number of numerical credits is\r\nconsidered to be inadmissible to the Staff Corps.\r\n\r\nThis classified list, prepared by the Consulting Committee of the Staff\r\nCorps, fixes the position of the Student Officers in order of merit, and\r\naccording to this order of merit they enter the Staff Corps. The\r\ncommittee reports to the Minister of War the names of the Student\r\nOfficers that are not eligible for the Staff Corps.\r\n\r\nThe first two or three places, we were told, are always remembered as\r\nmarks of distinction, but the honor does not descend lower, as in the\r\nintense competition of the Polytechnic.\r\n\r\nStudents belonging to the First Division may also be permitted to double\r\nthe second year’s course of study on account of illness; but in no case\r\ncan an officer be permitted to remain more than three years at the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY ORPHAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\nAT LA FLECHE.\r\n\r\nThe _Collége_ or _Prytanée Militaire_ appears, in point of studies, to\r\ndiffer from the schools that have just been described, chiefly in its\r\nhaving only one department for the elder pupils, the scientific, with\r\nmerely occasional subsidiary lessons in grammar and literature.\r\n\r\nThe institution is a school for boys between the ages of ten and\r\neighteen; no one under ten or above twelve years old can be admitted:\r\nand no one can commence a new course at the school after completing his\r\neighteenth year.\r\n\r\nThe prescribed instruction comprises the following courses:--\r\n\r\n  Humanities (Latin, &c.)\r\n  History and Geography.\r\n  German.\r\n  Mathematics.\r\n  Physical Sciences.\r\n  Natural History.\r\n  Figure Drawing.\r\n  Linear Drawing.\r\n\r\nAnd the general object of the courses is to qualify the pupils to pass\r\nthe examination for the degree of Bachelor of Science.\r\n\r\nThe pupils also go through military and gymnastic exercises, and learn\r\nto swim.\r\n\r\nThe school is under military discipline, is governed by a general\r\nofficer of the staff corps or a colonel in active service, as commandant\r\nand director of studies, and by a lieutenant-colonel or major, with the\r\ntitle and functions of second in command and sub-director. In addition\r\nthere are four officers, twenty-three professors and teachers, and\r\neighteen _répétiteurs_.\r\n\r\nThe yearly charge for paying pupils is 850 francs, and the cost of\r\noutfit about 500 francs; but there are 400 free and 100 half-free places\r\n(400 _bourses_ and 100 _demi-bourses_) granted by the state in favor of\r\nthe sons of officers, the order of preference being regulated as\r\nfollows, those who are orphans on both sides having the first claim, and\r\nthose who have lost their father, the next:--\r\n\r\n  1. Those whose fathers have been killed, or have died of wounds\r\nreceived in action.\r\n\r\n  2. Those whose fathers have died in the service, or after retiring on\r\na pension.\r\n\r\n  3. Sons of fathers who have been disabled in consequence of wounds\r\nreceived in action.\r\n\r\nSons of non-commissioned officers or of private soldiers who have been\r\nkilled or have been disabled in action, who have been placed on the\r\nretired list, or have been discharged after twenty years’ service, may\r\nalso be admitted, as a special mark of favor.\r\n\r\nThe candidates undergo an examination, not, however, for the purpose of\r\ncompetition, but merely to show that they are qualified to enter the\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\nThe school is inspected annually by a general officer sent by the war\r\ndepartment, as also by an officer of the commissariat. There is no sort\r\nof engagement or expectation that the pupils should enter the military\r\nservice. The nature of the studies holds out some inducement to them to\r\ncompete for admission at St. Cyr or the Polytechnic; and in the\r\nexamination for entrance at St. Cyr, it is stated that the sons of\r\nmilitary men have the privilege of being raised fifteen places in the\r\nlist of the order of merit. An officer’s or soldier’s son from La Flèche\r\nwould, in case of 300 candidates being admitted to St. Cyr, be able to\r\nclaim admission, if he came 315th on the list, to the exclusion of the\r\ncandidate who stood 300th.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF MUSKETRY\r\n\r\nThe School of Musketry, formed by the Ministerial Order of 29th March,\r\n1842, was only intended at first to supply instructors to the ten\r\nbattalions of Chasseurs who were armed with rifles. The results of its\r\nestablishment were, however, found so valuable, that the benefits of the\r\ninstruction it afforded were by degrees extended to the whole army.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, the Duc d’Aumale, who had taken a special interest in the\r\nimprovement of fire-arms and the better instruction of the soldier in\r\ntheir use, was nominated Inspector-General of Schools of Musketry.\r\nBesides the chief school at Vincennes, others were formed in the\r\nprincipal garrisons; and eventually a regimental School of Musketry was\r\nestablished in every regiment of infantry.\r\n\r\nSome changes have been made in the system established under the Duke.\r\nThe School of Musketry at Vincennes has only been regularly organized on\r\nits present footing since 1852. A portion of the fortress affords the\r\naccommodation required for the theoretical instruction, while the\r\nPolygon offers admirable facilities for practical instruction and target\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe Staff of the School consists of,--\r\n\r\n  A Commandant, a Lieut.-Colonel of Infantry.\r\n  An Instructor in Musketry, a Major of Infantry.\r\n  A Professor, a Captain of Artillery.\r\n  An Assistant Professor, a Captain of Artillery.\r\n  A Sub-Instructor in Musketry, a Captain of Infantry.\r\n\r\nEach regiment sends an Officer (a Sub-Lieutenant or a Lieutenant) to\r\nVincennes, to go through the course of instruction. The course commences\r\non the 1st of March, and lasts four months. Two hours a day three times\r\na week are devoted to lectures on the construction and use of fire-arms,\r\nand the theory of projectiles. Each officer is required to complete a\r\ncertain number of drawings of the separate parts of arms. At the\r\ntermination of the course, certificates are given, and, if favorable, go\r\ntowards the officer’s claim to be promoted “_au choix_.”\r\n\r\nWe were conducted over the rooms of the fortress set apart for the\r\nschool by the officer charged with the Theoretical Instruction (Captain\r\nFévre, of the Artillery.) They consist of a large paved room, where the\r\nofficers perform their small-arm exercise in bad weather; of the\r\nstudy-room, in which the drawings are executed; of a lecture-room or\r\namphitheater; of the library, chiefly supplied with technical works on\r\narms; and of a model-room, containing a very good collection of French\r\nand foreign arms, and of portions of arms, to illustrate the lectures.\r\nThere are, besides, private rooms for the instructors, and a room for\r\nthe orderlies. On the ground floor a small forge has been fitted up for\r\nthe purpose of giving practical instruction in some of the details of\r\nthe manufacture of arms.\r\n\r\nTo produce accurate marksmen is not the only object of the School of\r\nMusketry. Its staff may be considered a description of standing\r\ncommittee, to whom inventions in arms and ammunition are submitted, to\r\nhave their qualities practically tested. On the day of our visits\r\nexperiments on the relative merits of three forms of balls were being\r\ncarried on, which we witnessed.\r\n\r\nQuitting the fortress by a bridge over the ditch, in an angle of which\r\nthe Duc d’Enghien was shot, we entered on the Polygon or practice\r\nground. In a few minutes two detachments of troops, one from the\r\nChasseurs de Vincennes, the other from the 20th regiment of the line,\r\narrived and took up their ground in front of the practice butts. Of the\r\nballs between which comparisons were to be made, one was proposed by M.\r\nMinié, who was himself present, another by M. Nessler, the third was\r\nnamed the ball “_de la garde_.” There were six targets in line in front\r\nof the butt; the Chasseurs fired at three of them, and the 20th regiment\r\nat the other three. A trench runs along parallel to the butts, and at a\r\nfew yards in front of them. The line of targets is in the space between\r\nthe trench and the butts. The trench gives cover to the range party, one\r\nof whom is stationed opposite to each target, in a rude recess cut into\r\nthe side of the trench, to afford shelter in wet weather. Each time a\r\ntarget is struck, the man opposite to it raises his banderol, which is\r\nthen seen by the firing party, and acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThe trench is continued to some distance beyond the butts, and is there\r\nmet by another trench at right angles to it; so that one may go up from\r\nthe firing party to the range party without any risk.\r\n\r\nOn the cessation of the firing, the officer in command of the range\r\nparty numbered the hits in each target. He marked separately the hits\r\nwhere the balls had arrived sideways (shown by the form of the\r\nperforation,) a very important consideration in comparative experiments\r\nwith oblong balls.\r\n\r\nPrizes and honorable mentions are bestowed annually on the best shots.\r\nThe number of the regiment and the names of the men thus distinguished\r\nare inserted in the official military journal.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY AND NAVAL SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE AND PHARMACY\r\n\r\nI. IMPERIAL MILITARY SCHOOL OF APPLICATION OF MEDICINE AND PHARMACY AT\r\nPARIS.\r\n\r\nThis school, which is located at Paris, at the military hospital of\r\nVal-de-Grâce, is under the control of the Minister of War. Its design is\r\nto introduce the pupils in the medical service of the army to an actual\r\nexercise of their skill, to complete their practical education, and make\r\nthem acquainted with the regulations, which govern the army in its\r\nrelation to the sanitary service.\r\n\r\nAdmission to the School of Application as resident physicians and\r\npharmaceutists, is gained by passing successfully a competitive\r\nexamination. These examinations are held at Paris, Strasburg, and\r\nMontpelier, at uncertain periods, as the wants of the service may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nFor admission to the examination, the candidate for employment as\r\nresident physician must have his name enrolled in a bureau of military\r\nsuperintendence, and satisfy the following conditions:--1st. Be a native\r\nof France; 2nd. Be not above thirty years of age at the time of the\r\nexamination; 3rd. Have received the degree of doctor of medicine from\r\none of the medical faculties of the Empire; 4th. Be free from any\r\ninfirmity that disables from military service; and 6th. Subscribe a\r\npledge of honor that he will devote at least five years to the military\r\nsanitary service. The candidates are subjected to an examination in\r\npathology, medical therapeutics, anatomy, and practical surgery.\r\nCandidates for the office of resident pharmaceutist must also be natives\r\nof France, be not above thirty years of age, have a diploma of pharmacy\r\nof the first class, be free from every disabling infirmity, pledge\r\nthemselves to at least five years service, and pass an examination upon\r\nthe materia medica, chemistry, and pharmacy.\r\n\r\nDuring their continuance at the School, they receive a fixed annual\r\nsalary of 2,160 francs, and an allowance of 500 francs for the first\r\nexpense of uniform. After spending one year at the school and passing a\r\nsatisfactory final examination, they receive the brevet rank of medical\r\nor pharmaceutical aid-major of the second class.\r\n\r\nThere is at Strasburg, in connection with the Medical School, a\r\nPreparatory School, designed to prepare for the degree of doctor of\r\nmedicine the pupils belonging to the sanitary service of the army. It is\r\nannually supplied with pupils, who, without having passed the usual\r\ncourse of matriculation, are enabled to satisfy the conditions requisite\r\nfor admission to the first grade of a doctorate. Every pupil of the\r\npreparatory school, has the right of admission to the Imperial Military\r\nSchool of Application.--_Decrees of 13th of Nov., 1852, and 28th of\r\nJuly, 1860; Acts of 18th of June, and 15th of October, 1859, and 4th of\r\nAugust, 1860._\r\n\r\nII. IMPERIAL NAVAL SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE AND PHARMACY.\r\n\r\nThese schools, located at Brest, Toulon, and Rochefort, are under the\r\ncontrol of the Minister of the Marine; their design is to prepare\r\nsanitary officers for service in the vessels of the imperial marine.\r\n\r\nThe posts of surgeon, or pharmaceutist, of the third, second and first\r\nclasses are assigned on examination, according to order of priority\r\ndetermined by a medical jury. For admission as student in these schools,\r\nafter attaining to the first grade of the third class, it is necessary\r\nto be at least sixteen years of age, and not above twenty three, to\r\nproduce a diploma as bachelor of sciences, to prove French nationality,\r\nand to be exempt from every infirmity that can cause unfitness for the\r\nmarine service. Examinations for filling the vacancies in each school\r\ncommence on the 1st of April, and 1st of October, annually.\r\n\r\nThe instruction is continuous. The libraries, cabinets of natural\r\nhistory, the botanical gardens, anatomical theaters, chemical\r\nlaboratories, cabinets of natural philosophy, are at the disposition of\r\nthe students. The candidates admitted, receive cards of membership. They\r\nare required to pay the treasurer of the library a sum of 50 francs,\r\nwhich is devoted to its maintenance.--_Ordinance of 17th July, 1835, and\r\n15th May. 1842._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIAL NAVAL SCHOOL AT BREST.\r\n\r\nThis school, located at the Road of Brest, on board the ship “_La\r\nBorda_,” and under the control of the Minister of the Marine, is\r\ndesigned for the instruction of youth destined for the corps of state\r\nnaval officers. Candidates are admitted to this school after a public\r\nexamination, which occurs annually. For admission to the examination,\r\nthey must prove; 1st. By the production of the records, that they are\r\nFrench by birth or naturalization, and that on the 1st of January of the\r\nyear of the examination, they were at least fourteen years of age, and\r\nhad not passed the maximum of seventeen years; 2d. By the certificate of\r\na physician, that they have been vaccinated, or have had the small-pox,\r\nand that they have no infirmity that disables them from the performance\r\nof marine duty.\r\n\r\nThe matriculation of the candidate is effected between the 1st and 24th\r\nof April, at the prefecture of the department in which the domicil of\r\nthe family is located. The examination is made at the principal office\r\nfor examination nearest to that domicil, or to the college where he has\r\nbeen educated; the choice as regards the place of examination must be\r\nmade known at the time of matriculation.\r\n\r\nThere is required for admission into the school, a knowledge of\r\narithmetic, algebra, geometry, plane trigonometry, applied mathematics,\r\nnatural philosophy, chemistry, geography, the English language, and\r\ndrawing, in conformity with the course of study pursued at the lyceums.\r\nThe candidates must prepare a French composition, a translation from the\r\nLatin, an exercise in English, a numerical calculation in plane\r\ntrigonometry, a geometrical drawing, and the off-hand sketch of a head.\r\nThese compositions are done at Paris, and the principal towns of the\r\ndepartments simultaneously, on the 2nd and 3rd of July. The oral\r\nexaminations are commenced at Paris on the 2nd of July, and repeated at\r\nthe other towns in succession as previously announced. The oral\r\nexaminations are of two grades; the lowest serving to determine whether\r\nthe candidates are sufficiently well prepared for admission, the\r\nhigher--to which only those are subjected, who have successfully passed\r\nthe first--being the decisive one, and together with the compositions,\r\ndetermining the final classification in accordance with the order of\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nThe course of study continues two years, which are passed at the Board\r\nof Brest on the ship “_La Borda_.” The expense of board is 700 francs,\r\nand of the outfit, about 500 francs. A grant of the whole or half of the\r\namount of the expense, may be made to young men without fortune. The\r\ninsufficiency of the resources of a family for the maintenance of a\r\npupil in the school, must be authenticated by a resolution of the\r\nmunicipal council, approved by the prefect. There may also be allowed to\r\neach beneficiary, at his entrance into the school, the whole or the half\r\nof his outfit. Application for this assistance must be made to the\r\nMinister of the Marine at the matriculation of the candidate.\r\n\r\nThe pupils that have passed the examinations of the second year in a\r\nsatisfactory manner, are known as naval candidates of the second\r\nclass.--_Law of 5th June, 1850_--_Decree of 19th January, 1856_--_Acts\r\nof Sept., 1852, and 1st January, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF MILITARY GYMNASTICS NEAR VINCENNES.\r\n\r\nThe practice of gymnastics is an essential part of the training both of\r\nofficers and men in the French army, and constitutes a portion of the\r\nregular exercise in every military school. There are also several\r\nschools specially devoted to this department of physical education, and\r\none styled the Imperial School of Military Gymnastics at the Redoute de\r\nla Faisanderie, part of the fortifications near Vincennes, may be\r\nregarded as the Normal School for training both officers and privates in\r\norder to act as monitors or instructors in their respective regiments\r\nand battalions. The following account of the instruction given, is\r\nabridged from an article in the _New York Tribune_, under the heading,\r\n“How the French and the English make their Soldiers.” The writer says\r\nthat Military Gymnastics, in the form and to the extent taught in this\r\nschool, is exclusively French, and is thought to have an important\r\nbearing on the more frequent and deadly use of the bayonet in future\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n  About three hundred privates and officers compose the School of\r\nMilitary Gymnastics near Vincennes, where three professors of the\r\nscience and art of gymnastics give a course of practical instruction for\r\nabout six months each year. The school is under the same regulations as\r\nthe School of Musketry--each colonel being responsible for the\r\ninstruction of his regiment, and the lieutenant-colonel directs the\r\napplication of the rules and regulations.\r\n\r\n  I. ELEMENTARY GYMNASTICS.\r\n\r\n  The gymnastic exercises are divided into “elementary gymnastics,” and\r\n“gymnastics applied,” that is, applied to special military purposes.\r\nA general progression regulates all the exercises.\r\n\r\n  The men are divided into three classes. The third class comprises all\r\nthe recruits. These are exclusively practiced in the first lessons of\r\nelementary gymnastics during the first fortnight of their enlistment,\r\nand before they proceed to regimental drill. The first class consists of\r\nthose who are proficient in the first four lessons of the general\r\nprogression; and the second class, of those who are preparing for the\r\nfirst. The first class practices twice a week; the second, three times a\r\nweek; the third class twice a day, until the men have commenced their\r\nregimental drill, and then once a week. Each practice lasts one hour and\r\na half. “Returns” are drawn up recording the zeal and progress of the\r\nmen, as in musketry instruction; and the captain instructor of\r\ngymnastics has to send in, every month, to the lieutenant-colonel,\r\nsimilar returns as to the general progress of the instruction, so that\r\nthe number of effectives of each company may be accurately known.\r\n\r\n  None but the prescribed exercises are permitted by the instructor. He\r\nmust never allow the men to attempt any extraordinary or exaggerated\r\nfeats, that might cause accidents. His aim must be to develop the\r\nstrength, agility and dexterity of the soldier by a wisely regulated\r\nexertion, and inspire him with that self-reliance which the various\r\noccasions of his military life may demand. He must strive to rouse his\r\npluck and emulation by rendering the exercises as agreeable and as easy\r\nas possible, taking all necessary precautions to prevent him from\r\ninjuring himself or becoming discouraged. He must never forget that the\r\nperfect safety of the soldier under training, the pleasure of the\r\nvarious exercises, and, above all, the soldier’s own desire to excel,\r\nare the first and secret elements of success in gymnastics. Harsh\r\ntreatment must be carefully avoided, much more anything like turning his\r\nefforts into ridicule when he fails, or punishing him for involuntary\r\nawkwardness. In conclusion, he must not expect more than regularity,\r\nprecision, and relative perfection in these exercises, to which a\r\nmilitary form has been given merely to facilitate their study and their\r\napplication to the whole army.\r\n\r\n  The men practice in their fatigue dress, in squads of ten or fifteen,\r\nand are provided with belts.\r\n\r\n  The first exercises are intended to make the body supple from head to\r\nfoot, turning the head from right to left, forward and backward, or\r\nmerely toward right and left, bending the body, raising the arms\r\nvertically, with and without bending them; flinging out the right or\r\nleft arm, fists clenched, and describing a circle of which the arm is\r\nthe radius.\r\n\r\n  No soldier marches so easily as the French. It is the result of his\r\nmethod of learning to march. In the moderate and quick cadence the foot\r\ncomes flat to the ground, the point of the foot touching it first; in\r\nthe running cadence the movement is an alternate hopping on the points\r\nof the feet. It is obvious that this mode of teaching to march must\r\nenable the soldier to avoid the great cause of universal bad marching\r\nand walking, namely, bringing the heel to the ground, thus shaking the\r\nwhole body, especially the spine, and consequently distressing the brain\r\nand lungs. By the great elevation of the legs the soldier must habituate\r\nhimself to bringing the toes first to the ground, instinctively, to\r\navoid the shock, especially in the running cadence. During the practice\r\nthe soldier repeats the words “_one_--_two_,” as each foot comes to the\r\nground, in order to practice the lungs at the same time, and also to\r\ngive a rhythm to the performance.\r\n\r\n  In order still more to direct locomotion to the fore-part of the foot,\r\nso essential to good and easy marching, there is the following\r\npractice:--1. Attention. 2. Flexion of the lower limbs. 3. Commence.\r\n4. Cease. At the second command the soldier brings both feet together,\r\nthrowing the weight of the body forward. At the word _commence_, he\r\nslowly lowers his body by bending his hams, so that the thighs touch the\r\ncalves of the leg, the arms falling beside the body, the weight of the\r\nbody being entirely thrown on the points of the feet. He then gradually\r\nrises to the erect position.\r\n\r\n  There is also what is called the “gymnastic chain.” Circles are traced\r\non the ground contiguously; the men are posted in these circles, in a\r\nsingle rank, three paces apart. The instructor commands:--1. Squad will\r\nadvance. 2. Double. 3. March. 4. Halt. At the first word the soldier\r\nthrows the whole weight of his body on the right leg. At the word\r\n_march_, he throws the left foot smartly forward, the leg slightly bent,\r\nbringing the point of the foot to the ground, thirty-nine inches from\r\nthe right, and so in like manner with the right, always keeping the\r\nweight of the body on the leg which feels the ground, allowing the arms\r\nto take their natural motion for equilibrium. The first man (a monitor,\r\none of the best trained) runs successively through all the windings of\r\nthe chain of contiguous circles without stopping; the others follow,\r\npreserving the distance. When the men meet each other at the\r\nintersections of the circles, they shorten or lengthen the pace, so as\r\nnot to jostle each other, and so that two men shall not pass by the same\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\n  To deliver a thrust or a blow with the bayonet, sword, or fist to the\r\nbest advantage, requires training of the subsidiary muscles, and such\r\nscientific practice as places the body in the best position to aid and\r\nintensify the effect. This is done by the “Pyrrhic Exercise.” The\r\ncommand is:--1. Pyrrhic Exercise (right or left limb forward.) 2. Ready.\r\n3. March. 4. Halt. At the word _ready_, the soldier faces to the left,\r\ncarries the right foot forward, the heel sixteen inches from the hollow\r\nof the left foot, the right knee bent, the left leg stretched, the right\r\narm extended forward, the fist clenched, on a line with the shoulder,\r\nthe nails slightly upward, the left arm in a line with the left side and\r\nbut little bent, fist clenched, and about six inches from the thigh, the\r\nnails toward the thigh, the upper part of the body inclined forward, the\r\nhead erect, the eyes looking to the front, the left shoulder lowered. At\r\nthe word march, the soldier straitens his body, bringing the right heel\r\nnear the hollow of the left foot without touching the ground, turns at\r\nthe same time his right forearm, so that describing a circle from below\r\nupward, the fist lightly touches the right breast, then flinging the\r\nfist smartly forward, the nails a little upward, and advancing the right\r\nleg to about twenty-five inches, the foot striking the ground with\r\nforce, or an “attack,” as we call it in sword exercise, the upper part\r\nof the body inclining forward, the left leg stretched, the foot flat,\r\nthe left arm turned outward and along the thigh as before. These\r\nmovements are continued until the words “company--halt” are given, when\r\nthe soldier faces to the right and comes to attention. The left arms are\r\npracticed in like manner, and a rhythm is given to the performance by\r\nthe repetition of the numbers 1, 2, 3, by the soldier.\r\n\r\n  A soldier must not be easily knocked off his legs; so there are six\r\npositions for the practice devised to teach the soldier how to maintain\r\nhis equilibrium. He stands alternately on the right or left leg, bending\r\nthe other against the body with his locked fingers, or he stands on one\r\nleg, the other bent behind, or he comes slowly to the kneeling position\r\nand springs up smartly, flinging his arms suddenly above his head, the\r\nnails turned inward, and then comes to attention, or he bends forward on\r\none foot, or backward in like manner, and to the right or left, all on\r\none foot.\r\n\r\n  The elementary development of the muscles forms a most important part\r\nof the training. By word of command the soldiers strike their breasts\r\nwith the right or left fist--strike out with the right and left as in\r\nboxing--support cannon balls in the hand, one or both arms extended, and\r\nhurl the balls to a distance. They fling an iron bar, held by the\r\nmiddle; they support a heavy club in every possible position, at the\r\nshoulder, behind the back, one with the left hand, another with the\r\nright, at right-angles, or two together, one in each hand. They swing\r\nthe club horizontally and overhead, or vertically and behind, or round\r\nand round the body.\r\n\r\n  Preparatory to leaping, the proper muscles must be taught their\r\nnecessary contractions, and this is done to the words of\r\ncommand--“Simultaneous flexion of the legs,” “Simultaneous flexion of\r\nthe thighs and legs,” whereat they hop on the right or the left leg\r\nsingly, and then on both together. They are practiced in advancing on\r\nthe position of kneeling on one leg alternately, obviously a very useful\r\nmode of progression for a skirmisher in stealthily changing position\r\nbehind a low wall or a hedge.\r\n\r\n  They are taught to walk systematically on the heels alone and on\r\ntiptoe, and to fling a cannon ball with the foot by means of a strap\r\nattached to it. As practice alone can habituate us to the proper\r\ninclination of the body in ascending and descending, both these modes of\r\nmarching are carefully taught, attention being fixed to throwing the\r\nweight of the body on the point of the feet in the former, and on the\r\nheels in the latter.\r\n\r\n  Their wrestling takes every shape and mode of contest. With extended\r\narms, the fingers interlocked, the left leg advanced, they push against\r\neach other; or, holding each other by the hands or by the wrists, they\r\npull against each other; or, each man holding his left wrist with his\r\nright hand, the thumb underneath, seizes with his left hand the wrist of\r\nhis antagonist, and then at the word “wrestle,” he pulls or pushes\r\nuniformly or by jerks, to the right, to the left, forward, to the rear,\r\nupward and downward, striving to displace his antagonist.\r\n\r\n  Furnished with appropriate handles, with a short cord attached, they\r\npull against each other, each striving to drag his antagonist with one\r\nhand, then with both hands; and then three wrestle together in like\r\nmanner, the central man pulling or resisting the outer two, or both of\r\nthese pulling against him in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n  Then two wrestle in a sitting posture. They sit, closing the legs,\r\nfeet to feet, and sole to sole, with the aforesaid handle and cord\r\nbetween their feet, and at the word of command pull away, striving to\r\nraise each other. As soon as one is raised the contest ends, and the\r\nvictor holds the handle in his left hand. The instructor then makes all\r\nthose wrestle together successively who have won the handle, until only\r\ntwo remain, and then ascertains the strength of these two by a\r\ndynamometer, and makes a note of it.\r\n\r\n  The last of the elementary exercises are those of traction, or drawing\r\nagainst each other, holding on by a rope, either in pairs, or several\r\ntogether pulling against a fixed point, which may be a dynamometer,\r\nindicating the force of the combined pull resulting, or the men are\r\ndivided into two squads and pull against each other.\r\n\r\n  As most of these exercises admit of a rhythm or cadenced sound emitted\r\nby the men themselves, this vocal accompaniment is strongly recommended.\r\nIt certainly gives additional animation to the scene. Indeed the\r\ncultivation of the voice is considered eminently essential in the course\r\nof gymnastics. Singing exerts a salutary influence on the chest, and,\r\nmoreover, it is incontestable that it will be the means of powerfully\r\nacting on the _morale_ of the French soldier, by teaching him songs of\r\npatriotic and martial import. The singing-lesson at which I was present\r\nwas particularly interesting. The system is one recently invented,\r\nwherein the ordinary notes are represented by arithmetical numbers--thus\r\noccupying about one-third of the usual space. Pointing by means of two\r\ncanes to each representative number is all that is required by the\r\ninstructor. The pupils, about 300 men and officers, intoned the notes\r\nwith admirable precision. When the instructor opened out the canes they\r\nmade a crescendo--swelling to the loudest--and when he closed them\r\ngradually it was a beautiful diminuendo, “in linked sweetness long drawn\r\nout.” There was then sung a concerted piece in two parts, extemporized\r\nby the highly-gifted Commandant, who figured it on the blackboard. It\r\nwas at once most accurately sung--first and second so admirably\r\nconcerted that the whole seemed as it were an organ of human\r\nstops--alto, tenor, and bass most harmoniously blending.\r\n\r\n  Such are the elementary gymnastics of the course.\r\n\r\n  II. APPLIED GYMNASTICS.\r\n\r\n  The exercises of applied gymnastics must be directed with extreme\r\nprudence. Care must be taken by the instructor that the emulation of the\r\npupils should not degenerate into a spirit of rivalry, instigating them\r\nto dangerous efforts.\r\n\r\n  During cold weather they must abstain from executing leaps that\r\nrequire violent efforts; at all times those who are not perfectly\r\ndisposed should not be required to leap at all. Carelessness and\r\ninattention to the rules can alone cause those accidents apprehended in\r\nthese exercises.\r\n\r\n  The dimensions of the obstacles to be leaped over must be gradually\r\nincreased; but no downward leap must ever exceed sixteen feet--five\r\nmeters. Such is the regulation; but really to leap down sixteen feet\r\nseems no small matter, considering that the height of an ordinary\r\nroom--some ten or twelve feet--would make the nerves tingle if we had to\r\nleap down that height; however, the French soldiers perform such leaps\r\nwith ease, and therefore we must conclude that all Anglo-Saxons here or\r\nelsewhere can “go and do likewise.”\r\n\r\n  The words of command are: 1. Attention. 2. Forward--leap--one, two,\r\nthree. At the second word, the man closes the points of the feet; at the\r\nword one, he stoops on his lower extremities, slightly raising the heels\r\nand stretching his arms to the rear, the fists clenched; he then rises\r\nagain, the arms hanging naturally down. At the word two, he repeats the\r\nmovement; at three, he recommences the same movement, stretches the hams\r\nvigorously, throwing his arms forward, leaps the distance, or over the\r\nobstacle, falls on the point of his feet, stooping down, and then comes\r\nto attention.\r\n\r\n  The same principle is observed in all leaping, whether to a height,\r\ndownward, or forward and downward--the only difference being in the\r\nposition of the arms. In leaping upward, the arms are flung overhead to\r\naid the ascent--the same in a downward leap; but if the leap be forward\r\nand downward, the soldier begins with his arms in advance, and then\r\nplaces them perpendicularly for the fall. The reverse takes place when\r\nin leaping forward and upward.\r\n\r\n  Thus they practice leaping in every possible direction--upward and\r\ndownward combined--upward, forward, and downward--to the right or to the\r\nleft--to the right and to the left and downward combined--the arms being\r\ndirected accordingly. They leap backward precisely in the same\r\ndirections, and according to the same rules. In leaping backward from\r\nthe top of a wall, the man first takes a glance at the descent, turns,\r\ncloses his feet--the heels projecting over the wall, stoops--the upper\r\npart of the body being forward, places his hands outside his feet and\r\nseizes the edge of the wall, the four fingers above, the thumb\r\nunderneath, and thus flings himself backward, his arms overhead. When\r\nthere is width as well as depth in the backward leap, the body and the\r\nlegs are flung off almost horizontally.\r\n\r\n  The running leap is performed in a similar manner--the run being\r\nquickened more and more up to the moment of springing forward. Some of\r\nthe leaps I saw performed were from fifteen to twenty feet. As a\r\ncomplement to these leaping exercises, the ground may be prepared with\r\nvarious objects to leap over, such as benches, tables, heaps of stones,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n  The men are also progressively practiced in all these leaps, carrying\r\ntheir arms and baggage. In such cases the downward leap must be\r\nrestricted to thirteen feet. The soldier holds his rifle balanced at the\r\ntrail with the right hand, the muzzle slightly raised, so as to prevent\r\nit from touching the ground; he holds his sword (as the French soldier\r\nhas a sword) with his left hand. When the soldiers have become familiar\r\nwith leaping, the difficulty is increased by rendering movable first the\r\npoint of departure, and then the point of the fall, and, finally, both\r\nthese points are made movable. To leap from a body in oscillation, the\r\nsoldier leaps at the moment when the body is sinking. There is great\r\ndanger in leaping from an object in rapid motion. In case of necessity,\r\nthe soldier must face in the direction of the motion, and at the moment\r\nof quitting it he must lay hold of it, shortening his arms, and so push\r\nhimself backward, lengthening his arms.\r\n\r\n  It is a general principle that in leaping from a height of any extent,\r\nthe soldier should avail himself of anything at hand to diminish the\r\nshock of the fall.\r\n\r\n  The circumstances in which leaping must be resorted to are often\r\nunforeseen, and require prompt decision; it is therefore important that\r\nthe men should be taught the following principles--useful to\r\neverybody--to apply them spontaneously on all occasions:--\r\n\r\n  _First._ To form a rapid judgment of the obstacle, and also of the\r\nground on either side. We scan the ground in advance of the obstacle, in\r\norder to make a good choice of a footing for the leap; if the ground is\r\ntoo smooth the foot may slip; on soft ground there can not be a good\r\nfooting for the leap. By scanning the ground beyond the obstacle, we\r\nselect our landing-place, and we foresee what difficulties we shall meet\r\nwith. A difference of level between the point of departure and the fall\r\nmodifies considerably the extent of the leap.\r\n\r\n  _Second._ During the leap the breathing must be restrained, and the\r\nair with which the lungs have been previously filled must be expired the\r\nmoment the man reaches the ground.\r\n\r\n  _Third._ In leaps in width and height, fling out the clenched fists in\r\nthe direction the body is to take, so as to augment the impulse given by\r\nthe legs.\r\n\r\n  To prove the utility of this principle, the men, in leaping, sometimes\r\nhold in each hand a grenade of two-pounds weight, or a four-pound shot;\r\nwith this auxiliary the width of the leap is augmented.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth._ In downward leaps, raise the arms vertically as soon as the\r\nbody begins to descend, in order that the body, reaching the ground on\r\nthe point of the feet, may sink vertically without losing its\r\nequilibrium. If a man leaps into water, he places his arms at his side,\r\nhis hands on his hips, the feet close together, the points of the feet\r\nlowered, the body stiff and rigid.\r\n\r\n  _Fifth._ During the whole time of the leap keep the arms in the\r\nparallel position they have at its commencement, in order to preserve\r\nthe equilibrium of the body.\r\n\r\n  _Sixth._ In forward or wide leaps incline the body forward, in order\r\nthat the oblique action of the legs on the body may be more efficient.\r\n\r\n  The recommendation to precipitate the last movements of the run\r\npreceding the leap, has the important advantage of enabling the soldier\r\nto incline his body as much as possible.\r\n\r\n  _Seventh._ Fall on the point of the feet, the legs being close\r\ntogether, bending all the articulations of the body from above downward,\r\nin order that the shock be not transmitted to the head without being\r\nlessened and attenuated by numerous decompositions of the force. The\r\narticulations of the feet concur efficaciously with this result, and it\r\nwould be dangerous not to avail ourselves of them by falling on the\r\nsoles of the feet, especially the heels, as previously explained.\r\n\r\n  _Eighth._ Avoid too rough a fall by giving to all the articulations a\r\ngeneral and supple “setting up,” so as to make a light bound on landing.\r\n\r\n  _Ninth._ On landing avoid all useless motion, allow the muscles to\r\nrelax; their continued contraction and rigidity would interfere with the\r\nbody’s equilibrium.\r\n\r\n  They also practice leaping with poles. These are of different\r\ndimensions, beginning with the smallest--not longer than the rifle--and\r\nfinished with long ones from nine to twelve feet in length. He then\r\nseizes the pole higher or lower, according to the distance of the leap.\r\nOf course perfect success in this exercise depends greatly upon the\r\nenergy of the effort, and the long and rapid run by which it is\r\npreceded. They also leap with two poles together from a height, the\r\npoles being planted parallel and about two feet apart.\r\n\r\n  Suspension-bars are made subservient to the training of the French\r\nsoldier. This exercise enables him to use his body as he pleases, in any\r\npossible position, provided he can get hold of anything. Its beautiful\r\nand splendid result is extraordinary strength of arms, legs, hands, and\r\nfingers. Indeed, these suspensions of the body by the hands, the elbow,\r\nthe legs, by one hand, one leg, one finger, in every possible position,\r\nshow how the men are prepared for the thousand casualties of the\r\nassault.\r\n\r\n  They climb ropes after the manner of sailors, and horizontal beams are\r\nraised at various heights from the ground, in which they learn to\r\npreserve a perfect equilibrium--sitting, moving along them by the hands,\r\nsupporting the body, which is free to fall, and, finally, walking erect\r\nupon them like a rope-dancer without his balance-pole! In these ticklish\r\npositions they meet and pass each other--simulate a fall and recover;\r\nthe beams may be inclined or even set in motion, it matters not--they\r\nhold on and do their work equally well--and drop to the ground without\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n  They are taught to pick their way over scattered stones or stakes\r\ndriven into the ground; and it has even been thought expedient to teach\r\nthem how to walk systematically on stilts.\r\n\r\n  They are taught swimming--all its necessary movements before they go\r\ninto the water; and many, I was told, strike out at once, at the first\r\ntrial, thus proving the physiological or anatomical efficacy of the\r\nwell-considered mode of tuition. In the water they are practiced in\r\nperforming the feats required in actual warfare, carrying their arms and\r\naccoutrements in a variety of ways, according to the supposed\r\ncircumstances of the campaign.\r\n\r\n  Of course, if the men are taught to swim they must be sent regularly\r\ninto the water. This regulation, therefore, insures personal\r\ncleanliness--the first rule of health, which is much needed in all\r\narmies. The morality of most armies is generally above the average; it\r\nshould naturally be less--as nothing conduces more to long life than\r\nexercise, regular hours, and a rational discipline. But cleanliness,\r\npersonal cleanliness is wanting, and we have to deplore the\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\n  With a view to escalading, the French soldier is assiduously trained\r\nin all the shifts of ladder-mounting--with ladders of wood and ladders\r\nof rope--and he becomes as good as a sailor in pulling himself up a\r\nrope, either looped, knotted, or smooth, from the ground to any\r\nreasonable or unreasonable height. If a scaling-ladder be not at hand, a\r\ntent-pole or any pole will do to enable him to get to the top of a wall\r\nor the crest of a parapet. He is actually taught nine different modes of\r\nperforming this achievement so flattering to the ambition of the French\r\nsoldier.\r\n\r\n  The scaling of a represented turret was something beautiful to see.\r\n“In the twinkling of an eye” or “done in no time,” can alone describe\r\nthe rapidity of the exploit.\r\n\r\n  Every appliance may, however, be wanting on certain occasions in\r\nwar--it matters not--the French soldiers are taught how to mount a wall\r\nwithout any instrument whatever--with their feet and the hands and the\r\nfingers alone. Bullets and cannon balls leave holes and indentations in\r\nthe hardest walls--these are represented on the walls of the\r\nGymnasium--and thus they practice this last resort of the resolute and\r\ndetermined besiegers. If there be no holes--no _points d’appui_ for the\r\nascent--what then? Why, then they build a _pyramid of men_--four men\r\nstand as a base, two or four more perch themselves on the shoulders of\r\nthese, and then one mounts to the top on the shoulders of the latter by\r\nway of apex!\r\n\r\n  They have adopted all the fetes of the _trapèze_, as performed by\r\nacrobats. These tend to strengthen the arms and promote that\r\nself-reliance and confidence which are the prime elements of a good\r\nsoldier. Some of their swinging leaps with the _trapèze_ were\r\nprodigious, from one end of the long gymnasium to the other, where they\r\nalighted, and caught on the top of the wall, and descended to the\r\nground, with hands and fingers, by mimic bullet holes, as before\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n  Flying leaps on and over a wooden horse are practiced in every\r\npossible direction, and the French cavalry are required to be able to\r\nleap on their horses from the rear while galloping, and to leap over a\r\nhedge or barrier together with the horses, but on foot, holding the\r\nreins! It is impossible to believe that very many can do this; but that\r\nis the aim, and the higher the aim the greater the effort, and something\r\nworth having is sure to be done, even if we fail of the highest\r\nattainment.\r\n\r\n  The most laborious of the practices is probably that of carrying, at\r\nthe top of their speed, all the implements of war, fascines, sand-bags,\r\ngabions, projectiles, &c., whose weight is progressively increased from\r\ntwenty to fifty pounds. They must also practice carrying ladders, beams,\r\ncaissons, dragging gun-carriages, &c., and they are equally habituated\r\nto carry rapidly and skillfully the wounded from the field of battle, by\r\nplacing men on litters, or any substitute at hand, in the gymnasium.\r\n\r\n  Sword exercise, bayonet exercise, boxing and fencing are also taught,\r\nbut only the rudiments. In the regiments and battalions they have more\r\nopportunities of perfecting themselves in these accomplishments.\r\n\r\n  Such is a succinct account of the military gymnastics of the French.\r\nThe 300 various fetes and practices have only one object in view,\r\npreparation for the possible and probable casualties of war, but they\r\nhave, meanwhile, the positive and immediate effect of giving the men the\r\nutmost freedom of motion, _aplomb_, self-reliance, and that very useful\r\nself-estimate in the soldier, namely, that he is superior to every other\r\nin the world. It will take a vast deal to knock that conceit out of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON FRENCH MILITARY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nThe English Commissioners in their Report on “The best Mode of\r\nReorganizing the [English] System of Training Officers for the\r\nScientific Corps, together with an Account of Foreign and other Military\r\nEducation,” close with the following general remarks on French Military\r\nEducation:--\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following summary may close our account of French Military\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n1. The French army combines a considerable proportion of officers\r\nprofessionally educated, with others, who form the majority, whose\r\nclaims to promotion consist in their service, proved ability, and\r\nconduct. One-third of the officers in the line, two-thirds of those in\r\nthe scientific corps, and the whole of the staff, receive a careful\r\nprofessional education; the remainder are taken upon the recommendation\r\nof their superior officers, from the ranks. But it was stated to us\r\nexpressly that such officers do not often rise above the rank of\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n2. There are no junior military schools in France, and no military\r\neducation commences earlier than sixteen. This is the very earliest age\r\nat which pupils can be received at the Polytechnic or at St. Cyr, and\r\nthe _usual_ age is later; whilst in the case of the Special Corps,\r\nstrictly professional education does not begin till twenty or\r\ntwenty-one. The best preparation for the military schools is found to be\r\nthat _general_ (in France chiefly _mathematical_) education which is\r\nsupplied by the ordinary schools of the country, directed as these are\r\nand stimulated by the open examinations for admission to St. Cyr and the\r\nPolytechnic.\r\n\r\n3. The professional education for commissions in the line is that\r\ngiven at the school of St. Cyr. A fair amount of mathematics is required\r\nat entrance, but the chief instruction given at the school is of a\r\nprofessional character. Active competition, however, which is the\r\nprinciple of all French military education, is kept up amongst young men\r\neducating for the line by the competitive entrance to the school, by the\r\nsystem of examinations pursued in it, and in particular, by the\r\ntwenty-five or thirty places in the Staff School which are practically\r\nreserved for the best pupils on leaving.\r\n\r\n4. In the Staff School itself the competitive system is acted upon;\r\nthere are strict examinations, and the pupils are ranged in the order of\r\nmerit on leaving the College.\r\n\r\n5. The officers of artillery and engineers may be said to be in quite\r\na peculiar position in France, owing to the high education given at the\r\nPolytechnic School. The consequence is, that the preparatory education\r\nof French artillery and engineer officers is of the highest scientific\r\ncharacter. We have already spoken largely on this point, and need do no\r\nmore than allude to it.\r\n\r\n6. We may remark, that preparatory military education in France is\r\nmainly mathematical--at the Polytechnic almost wholly so. The literary\r\nand classical elements, which enter so largely into all education in\r\nEngland and Prussia, are in French military education very much thrown\r\naside. Lectures in military history and literature are said, however, to\r\nsucceed at St. Cyr.\r\n\r\n7. The system of State foundations (_Bourses_) existing in the\r\nPolytechnic and St. Cyr, and affording a curious parallel to the\r\nmilitary foundations in the Austrian schools, requires some notice.\r\nEvery pupil, in both the Polytechnic and St. Cyr, who can prove poverty,\r\nis entitled to State support, either entire or partial. At the present\r\ntime, not less than one-third of the students in each of these schools\r\nreceive such maintenance. The system of civil _Bourses_ is of old\r\nstanding in France; most of these were destroyed at the Revolution. They\r\nwere renewed and greatly devoted to military purposes by Napoleon. The\r\nextent to which they are given may seem excessive, but it must prove a\r\npowerful incentive and assistance to talent.\r\n\r\n8. It has been remarked that there is comparatively little practical\r\nteaching in the School of Application for Artillery and Engineers at\r\nMetz. But a very extensive practical training is in fact supplied to\r\nthese officers after they enter the service, remaining as they must do\r\nwith the troops until promoted to the rank of second captain, and\r\nsubsequently being employed in the arsenals, workshops, fortified\r\nplaces, &c.\r\n\r\n9. The French have no “senior departments” for military education. In\r\nthis respect their practice differs from that of England and Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH MILITARY EDUCATION IN 1869.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks on French Military Education are from the Report\r\nof the English Military Education Commission submitted to Parliament,\r\nand printed in 1870:\r\n\r\n  1. The proportion of professionally educated officers in the line is\r\ngreater now than in 1856, when it was stated by the Commissioners in\r\ntheir report to be one-third.\r\n\r\n  2. The professional education for commissions in the line is given by\r\na two years’ course at St. Cyr, admission to the school being dependent\r\non competitive examination. Admission to the Artillery and Engineers is\r\nobtained through the Polytechnic, where young men intended for\r\ncommissions in those arms receive a preparatory education of a highly\r\nscientific character, in common with candidates for many other branches\r\nof the public service. Admission to the school is obtained by\r\ncompetition, and the choice of services is dependent on the results of\r\nanother competitive examination at the end of the two years’ course.\r\nCommissions are then obtained in the respective corps, and the young\r\nofficers go for a further period of two years to the School of\r\nApplication at Metz, there to receive their strictly professional\r\ninstruction. The course of teaching at Metz is still mainly of a\r\ntheoretical character, and the main portion of the practical training of\r\nthe officers is deferred until they join their regiments. The Staff\r\nCorps is recruited entirely from the Staff School; a very small number\r\nof pupils from the Polytechnic have a claim to admission to the school,\r\nbut the great majority of the students are admitted by competitive\r\nexamination, open nominally to the sub-lieutenants of the army and to\r\nthe best students of St. Cyr, but in practice almost entirely confined\r\nto the latter. The students join the school with commissions as\r\nofficers; at the end of the two years’ course they are definitely\r\nappointed to the Staff Corps in the order in which they stand in a\r\ncompetitive examination, but before being employed upon the staff they\r\nare sent to do duty for five years with the various arms.\r\n\r\n  3. The military schools in France are not, as in England and in\r\nPrussia, placed under the control of a special department. They are all\r\nunder the immediate management of the Minister of War. There is,\r\nhowever, for each branch of the service in the French army a consulting\r\ncommittee (_comité consultatif_), or board of general officers, attached\r\nto the War Department, for the purpose of giving advice to the Minister,\r\nand in matters affecting the individual schools the Minister generally\r\nconsults the _comité consultatif_ of that branch of the service for\r\nwhich the school is specially preparatory.\r\n\r\n  4. Each school has its own _conseil d’instruction_, composed of\r\nofficers and professors of the establishment, which exercises a general\r\nsupervision over the course of instruction, and has the power of\r\nsuggesting alterations or improvements in it. The financial business of\r\nthe school is managed by another board (_conseil d’administration_); and\r\nthere is generally also a similar board (_conseil de discipline_), which\r\nexercises more or less authority in questions of discipline. The effect\r\nof this arrangement is to give the various officers and professors of\r\neach school to some extent a voice in the general management of the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\n  5. The staff of officers and instructors employed appears, in most\r\ncases, very large in proportion to the number of the students; 48 for\r\n270 in the Polytechnic; 33 for 170 in the school at Metz; 62 for 600 in\r\nSt. Cyr, &c.\r\n\r\n  Though there is in all the schools a military staff separate from the\r\nstaff of professors and instructors, and more especially charged with\r\nthe maintenance of discipline, the line of separation between the two\r\nbodies is not, except at the Polytechnic, so distinctly drawn as in the\r\nEnglish military schools. The military professors exercise disciplinary\r\npowers; while, on the other hand, the members of the strictly military\r\nstaff in almost all cases take some part in instruction. The latter\r\nappear to be more utilized for this purpose than is the case either at\r\nSandhurst or Woolwich.\r\n\r\n  6. Considerable care is exercised in the appointment of professors; at\r\nthe Polytechnic the candidates are selected by the _Conseil de\r\nPerfectionnement_; at La Flèche they are recommended to the Minister of\r\nWar by the Minister of Public Instruction; at the Staff School and St.\r\nCyr the appointments are thrown open to competition.\r\n\r\n  7. The discipline maintained at all the schools is of a very strict\r\nnature; except for the youngest pupils at La Flèche it is entirely\r\nmilitary; the punishments are similar to those inflicted in the army,\r\nand even include imprisonment. The maintenance of discipline is\r\nconsiderably facilitated by the fact that the pupils at most of the\r\nschools are actually subject to military law; and those of St. Cyr, if\r\ndismissed from the school, are sent into the ranks as private soldiers.\r\nThere appears, however, in all the schools to be an absence of the moral\r\ncontrol over the young men which is exercised in the Prussian schools.\r\nThe Commandant of each school has very extensive powers in regard to\r\ndiscipline, but in no case has he authority to dismiss a student from\r\nthe school without the sanction of the Minister of War.\r\n\r\n  8. The principle carried out in France is that special military\r\neducation should not be begun until a comparatively late age, and should\r\nbe founded upon a groundwork of good general education in civil schools.\r\nThe only approach to a junior military school in France is that of La\r\nFlèche, and this is mainly a charitable institution; the pupils, it is\r\ntrue, learn drill, but beyond this no special military instruction is\r\ngiven them. The course of study is the same as that at the _Lycées_ or\r\nordinary civil schools, and the pupils are under no obligation to enter\r\nthe military service. Nor can the Polytechnic be called an exclusively\r\nmilitary school; even those who enter the Artillery and Engineers from\r\nit have their education in common with civilians at the very least until\r\nthe age of 18, and in the great majority of cases their strictly\r\nprofessional instruction at Metz does not begin till 20 or 21. The very\r\nearliest age at which a special military education commences in France\r\nis 17, which is the age of admission to St. Cyr, and comparatively few\r\nenter the school before 18 or 19. The knowledge required for admission\r\nto St. Cyr is entirely such as is acquired at civil schools, and so much\r\nimportance is attached to a good general education that the degree of\r\neither _bachelier ès sciences_ or _bachelier ès lettres_ is made a\r\nnecessary qualification for admission to the examination, while the\r\npossession of both degrees gives considerable advantage to a candidate.\r\nThe principle of deferring the commencement of special instruction has\r\neven received extension since 1856; the age of admission to St. Cyr,\r\nwhich was then 16, has been now increased to 17, and the junior school\r\nof La Flèche has been made even less military in its character than it\r\nwas at that time.\r\n\r\n  9. When a professional education has once commenced, the principle\r\nappears to be that it should be almost entirely confined to subjects\r\nwhich have a practical bearing on military duties. Mathematics, as a\r\nsubject by themselves, do not form part of the ordinary course of\r\ninstruction at any of the special schools. The previous course at the\r\nPolytechnic secures of course very high mathematical attainments in the\r\ncandidates for the Artillery and Engineers who enter Metz; but at Metz\r\nitself the study of mathematics is no longer continued. In the same way\r\nat the Staff School a knowledge of mathematics as far as trigonometry is\r\nrequired for admission, and their practical applications to operations\r\nof surveying enter into the school course; but no part of the time spent\r\nat the school is devoted to mere theoretical instruction in pure\r\nmathematics; yet the officers of the Staff Corps are intrusted with the\r\nexecution of those scientific surveys which in our service are in the\r\nhands of the Engineers.\r\n\r\n  St. Cyr offers to some extent an exception to the rule that the course\r\nof study at the special schools should be of an exclusively professional\r\ncharacter, as the instruction given there during the first year is\r\npartly of a general nature, embracing history and literature. This,\r\nhowever, arises from the fact that the students from the _Lycées_\r\ngenerally show a deficiency in the more literary subjects of a liberal\r\neducation, and a portion of the time at the school is therefore spent in\r\ncompleting and improving their general acquirements. A knowledge of\r\narithmetic, algebra, and plane trigonometry is required as a\r\nqualification for admission, but beyond a very brief revision of these\r\nsubjects, and a voluntary course for candidates for the Staff Corps,\r\nmathematics are not taught at the school. It would seem indeed that,\r\nexcept in the case of candidates for admission to the Artillery and\r\nEngineers, mathematics do not hold so prominent a position in French\r\nmilitary education as is generally supposed in England to be the case.\r\nFor staff and regimental officers the main requisite demanded seems to\r\nbe a practical knowledge of trigonometry as required for surveying.\r\n\r\n  10. Much time is devoted in all the French schools to drawing in its\r\nvarious branches; some hours daily are invariably given up to the\r\nsubject; indeed the time spent upon purely geometrical drawing appears\r\nalmost to be excessive. The great importance attached to the drawing of\r\n_machinery_ is a peculiar feature in all the schools. Landscape drawing\r\nis one of the regular subjects taught to candidates both for the line\r\nand the Staff Corps.\r\n\r\n  The theoretical instruction given at every school is supplemented by\r\nvisits to numerous military establishments, manufacturing departments,\r\nand fortresses. This is also a feature in the system of military\r\neducation in Prussia; in both countries it seems to be thought desirable\r\nto afford young officers a practical insight into the working of the\r\nvarious establishments connected with the army. In the case of officers\r\nof the Artillery and Engineers it appears in France to be made a special\r\nobject to cultivate a mechanical genius, and to secure a thorough\r\nacquaintance with manufacturing departments with which their\r\nprofessional duties bring them into contact.\r\n\r\n  Military law and administration (comprising financial and other\r\nregulations connected with the army), and drill, riding, and fencing in\r\nthe way of practical exercises, form part of the education of officers\r\nof all branches of the service; in drill, lectures explanatory of the\r\ndrill-book are invariably given in addition to the practical\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\n  11. The system of instruction in all the French military schools is\r\nmore or less that of the Polytechnic. Lectures attended by large\r\nnumbers, enforced study of fixed subjects, the execution of all work\r\nunder close supervision of the instructors, and frequent periodical\r\nexaminations, are everywhere found. Active competition is the leading\r\nfeature of the system; the students are perpetually being “kept up to\r\nthe mark.” A fixed period of two years is in all cases assigned to the\r\ncourse of study; the course can not be completed in a shorter time, and\r\nthe regulated period can not (unless under quite exceptional\r\ncircumstances) be exceeded.\r\n\r\n  It seems also to be thought that, as a necessary consequence of the\r\nstrictly competitive system, the subjects upon which the competition\r\ndepends should be exactly the same for every student. No choice of\r\nstudies is allowed; those which enter into the examination are equally\r\nobligatory for all. The only exception to this rule is at St. Cyr, where\r\nin languages a choice between German and English is given.\r\n\r\n  No pecuniary rewards are offered to the students at any of the\r\nschools. The bestowal of the numerous _bourses_ which are granted to\r\nthose admitted to the Polytechnic and St. Cyr is regulated entirely by\r\nthe poverty of the candidates, without any regard to their ability.\r\n\r\n  12. The education of officers in France is entirely concluded before\r\nany regimental duty has been done. The French system is in this respect\r\nthe exact opposite of that pursued in Prussia, where no professional\r\ninstruction, as a rule, is given until a certain amount of service with\r\nthe troops has been performed. There are in France no establishments for\r\nthe instruction of officers of some years’ service, like the Staff\r\nCollege in England, or the Artillery and Engineer School and the War\r\nAcademy in Prussia.\r\n\r\n  13. The chief changes which have taken place in the military schools\r\nof France since the publication of the Report of the Commissioners of\r\n1856 may be summarized as follows:--\r\n\r\n    (_a._) The modifications in the course of instruction at the\r\nPolytechnic; the abridgement of the studies previously pursued; and the\r\nslightly increased importance now attached to literary subjects.\r\n\r\n    (_b._) At Metz, the introduction of an examination at the end of the\r\nfirst years’ course of study.\r\n\r\n    (_c._) At St. Cyr, the alteration of the age for admission to the\r\nschool from 16 to 17; the extension of the subjects of the entrance\r\nexamination; the modifications in the course of instruction, and the\r\npostponement of the commencement of strictly military studies almost\r\nentirely until the second year; the introduction of a stricter system of\r\ndiscipline, combined with additional encouragements to good conduct and\r\nindustry; and the increased advantages offered with the view of\r\nattracting to the school a higher class of professors and officers.\r\n\r\n    (_d._) At La Flèche, the complete reorganization of the institution\r\nwith the object of more closely assimilating its general arrangements to\r\nthose of a purely civil school.\r\n\r\n    (_e._) At the Staff School some modifications in the course of study\r\nand in the mode of admission to the school have been made; but the most\r\nimportant alterations are those adopted in July 1869, by which the\r\nnumber of students admitted annually to the school is increased\r\nconsiderably beyond the number of vacancies likely to occur in the Staff\r\nCorps, and the novel principle is introduced that admission to the\r\nschool does not carry with it the certainty of permanent employment on\r\nthe staff.\r\n\r\n  It may be added that there seems a tendency to diminish the importance\r\nof mathematics as an element of preparatory military education, and to\r\nattach slightly more weight to studies of a literary character. This is\r\nmore particularly seen at St. Cyr and at La Flèche, and to a less extent\r\nat the Polytechnic. There is also a growing disposition to increase, in\r\nthe case of the cavalry and infantry, the proportion of officers who\r\nhave received a professional education.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENSE OF MILITARY SCHOOLS IN 1869.\r\n\r\n  SC Sums charged to the Schools Estimate.\r\n  MP Military pay charged to other Estimates.\r\n  T  Total.\r\n  CS Cost to the State.‡\r\n  EP Each pupil.\r\n\r\n  Name of School.

OUTLINE OF MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the law of the 3rd of September, 1814, which is the basis\r\nof the present military organization of Prussia, every Prussian above\r\ntwenty years of age, is bound to service in arms for the defense of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe military force of the country is made up of three distinct bodies,\r\nand the whole of the adult male population is distributed among them. It\r\nconsists of,--\r\n\r\nI. The Standing Army.\r\n\r\nII. The National Militia or _Landwehr_, divided into two portions, viz.,\r\nthe first _Landwehr_ and the second _Landwehr_.\r\n\r\nIII. The Last Reserve or _Landsturm_.\r\n\r\nI. The standing army is composed of all young men between twenty and\r\ntwenty-five years of age. The period of service in time of war is for\r\nfive years, but in time of peace the young soldiers can obtain leave of\r\nabsence after three years’ service;--they belong for the remaining two\r\nyears to what is termed the “reserve,” receiving neither pay nor\r\nclothing, and they are subject to be recalled if war should break out.\r\n\r\nEncouragement, indeed, is given and advantages held out to induce men to\r\nstay, and to take a new engagement for an additional term of six years;\r\nbut it is said that only a small number are thus obtained. The bulk of\r\nthe troops are men serving for this short time; and there are many, it\r\nshould be added, whose term of service is even yet shorter. For all\r\neducated young men, all, that is, who pass a certain examination, are\r\nallowed, on condition that they pay for their own equipment and receive\r\nno pay, to shorten their service from three years to one. This privilege\r\nappears to be very largely used. It should also be stated, that young\r\nmen of any class may volunteer to perform their service at any age after\r\nseventeen.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian standing army amounts at the present time to about 126,000\r\nmen. It is divided into nine army-corps or corps d’Armée, one of which\r\nis named the guard, and the others are numbered from I. to VIII. In each\r\nthere is a regiment of artillery and a division of engineers. A regiment\r\nof artillery consists, in time of peace, of three divisions; each\r\ndivision of one troop of horse artillery and four companies, of which,\r\none is Fortress artillery with two-horsed pieces. Each regiment has thus\r\nthree companies for the service of the fortress and twelve for field\r\nservice. The whole of the artillery is under the command of a general\r\ninspector, and it is divided into four inspections. An engineer division\r\nis composed of two companies. There are nine engineer divisions, one in\r\neach army corps. The whole are commanded by a general inspector, and\r\nthey are divided into three inspections.\r\n\r\nThe promotion in the Prussian infantry and cavalry is regimental, and by\r\nseniority, up to the rank of major; after that it is by selection; and\r\nan officer who has been passed over two or three times may consider that\r\nhe has received an intimation to retire from the service. In the\r\nartillery the promotion is by regiments; in the engineers it is general.\r\n\r\nII. The first Landwehr, or Landwehr of the _first_ summons (_des ersten\r\naufgebots_,) consists principally of young men between twenty-five and\r\nthirty-two years of age, who enter when they have completed their period\r\nof service in the standing army. They are called out once every year for\r\nservice with the divisions of the standing army to which they are\r\nattached, for a period varying from a fortnight to a month; and they may\r\nbe sent in time of war on foreign service.\r\n\r\nThose who have passed through the first Landwehr, enter at the age of\r\nthirty-two in the second Landwehr, or Landwehr of the _second_ summons\r\n(_des zweiten aufgebots_.) They are called out only for a very brief\r\nservice once a year, and they can not at any time be ordered out of the\r\ncountry, but continue to form a part of the _second_ Landwehr until they\r\nare thirty nine years of age.\r\n\r\nIII. After the age of thirty-nine a Prussian subject belongs to the last\r\nreserve or Landsturm, and can only be summoned to service in arms upon a\r\ngeneral raising, so to say, of the whole population, when the country is\r\nactually invaded by the enemy.\r\n\r\nWith the standing army, the center of the system, all the other forces\r\nare kept in close connection. For every regiment of the standing army\r\nthere is a corresponding regiment of Landwehr, and the two together form\r\none brigade. In the local distribution, every village and hamlet of the\r\nPrussian dominions belongs to a certain regiment of Landwehr, serving\r\nwith a certain regiment of the army, and belonging accordingly to one of\r\nthe nine army corps.\r\n\r\nSuch is the military organization, which, from the important part played\r\nin it by the _Landwehr_, is sometimes termed the Prussian _Landwehr_\r\nsystem. The history of its formation is remarkable, and the\r\ncircumstances which led to its creation helped also to create the very\r\npeculiar education of the army.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian _Landwehr_ or militia is not of modern origin; in its form\r\nat least it is but a revival of the old feudal military organization, so\r\nfar as that consisted of raising the country _en masse_, instead of\r\nkeeping up a permanent, trained, and limited military force. _Landwehr_\r\nor _Landsturm_[2] was the old German name for this feudal array, before\r\nthe system of standing armies was begun in Europe by Charles VII. of\r\nFrance, with his Scotch regiments. It was possibly the failure of the\r\ntrained Prussian armies--long reputed the models of military\r\ndiscipline--in the attack upon France in 1792, and still more signally\r\nat Auerstadt and Jena, which partly led to the revival of the _Landwehr_\r\nas the peculiar national force of Prussia. The means by which Stein, and\r\nafter his expulsion, Scharnhorst, called it into activity, was a master\r\nstroke of policy under the existing difficulties of the country. The\r\nfollowing outline may be sufficient to explain its effects upon\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Thus _Landsturm_ is the word used for the rising _en\r\n    masse_ of the Tyrol in 1809.]\r\n\r\nThe condition which Napoleon had exacted at Tilsit--a reduction of the\r\nstanding army from 200,000 to 40,000 men--would have lowered Prussia at\r\nonce to the rank of a second-rate power. It was adroitly evaded by the\r\nplan of keeping only 40,000 men in arms at one and the same time,\r\ndisbanding these as soon as they were disciplined, and replacing them\r\nconstantly by fresh bodies. Thus the whole population of the country was\r\nready to rise in 1813, after the crisis of Napoleon’s retreat from\r\nRussia. The plan was chiefly due to the genius of Scharnhorst, whose\r\nearly death deprived Prussia of her greatest scientific soldier. The\r\n_Landwehr_ then proved itself a most efficient force, though its success\r\nwas promoted by the national enthusiasm, which must prevent our taking\r\nsuch a period as a criterion of its permanent military working. Since\r\nthat time it has continued to be the national army of the country.\r\n\r\nWe were assured that this peculiarity of the Prussian army system, by\r\nwhich almost every man in the country serves in his turn in the ranks,\r\nhas had a tendency to improve the education of the officers. It seems to\r\nhave been felt that the officers would not retain the respect of\r\nintelligent privates unless they kept ahead of them in education. And\r\nthis impression appears to have been the cause of the royal edicts\r\npassed in 1816, by which it was required that every Prussian officer\r\nshould pass two examinations before receiving his commission, one to\r\ntest his general education, and the other his professional knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. HISTORICAL VIEW OF PRUSSIAN MILITARY EDUCATION.[3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: The chief authority for this paper is a very detailed\r\n    account of the Staff School, (_Kriegs-Schule_,) by Friedländer,\r\n    pp. 1-360.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prussian system of military education stands in close connection\r\nwith the general education of the country, just as the Prussian military\r\norganization is the peculiar creation of that country’s history. And the\r\ngreatest improvements in the army and in its scientific teaching have\r\nbeen made at those remarkable periods when we should most naturally have\r\nlooked for them--the time of Frederick the Great and the Liberation war\r\nof 1813-1814.\r\n\r\nThe leading principles of Prussian military education consist, _first_,\r\nin requiring from every officer in the army proof of a fair _general_\r\neducation before his entrance, and of a fair _military_ education\r\nafterwards. _Secondly_, they encourage a higher military education in a\r\nsenior school, which has almost exclusively the privilege of supplying\r\nthe staff.\r\n\r\nIn this requirement of a fair education, both general and military,\r\n_universally_ from its officers, Prussia stands alone among the great\r\nmilitary nations of Europe, and this honorable distinction is in a great\r\nmeasure the result of the diffused system of education throughout the\r\ncountry, and of the plan adopted by Stein and Scharnhorst, to make the\r\nofficers the leaders of the army both in education and in military\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe military schools of Germany may be said to have begun with the\r\nReformation wars. Some such were founded by Maurice of Saxony, the great\r\npolitical and military genius of Germany in that century; the example\r\nwas soon imitated in Baden, Silesia, and Brunswick, and a curious sketch\r\nof military education, by the hand of Duke Albert of Brandenburg, has\r\nbeen lately published from the Berlin archives, in which theology and\r\nmathematics hold the two most important places.\r\n\r\nThe first school of any real importance was founded in Colberg, by the\r\ngreat elector, Frederick William, in 1653. This had considerable\r\nsuccess, and both his successors, King Frederick and Frederick William\r\nI., improved it greatly, and finally transferred it to Berlin. It was\r\nthe time (about 1705, 1706,) of the great advance in military\r\nengineering under Vauban and Coehorn, and a school for engineering was\r\nfounded, in which some of their pupils had a great share. The first\r\nPrussian trigonometrical survey also dates as early as 1702; that of\r\nEngland was not begun till 1784. It may indeed be said that the\r\nscientific arms began to take a more favorable place in the Prussian\r\narmy about this time. They have held, and even still hold in some\r\nrespects, a less distinguished position in Germany than in France,\r\nEngland, or Sardinia; and the first instance of an artilleryman being\r\nmade a general, was in the reign of Frederick William I.\r\n\r\nOn Frederick the Great’s accession he found several military schools in\r\nexistence. These had been chiefly founded by his eccentric father, who\r\nhad a passion for Cadet Houses and cadets, and their object is said to\r\nhave been to supply an education to the nobility, who at that time were\r\nvery ill-taught in Germany. After Frederick’s first wars, his own\r\nattention was much occupied by the need of a better military education,\r\nand he continued to work at the subject very zealously till his death.\r\nHis example on this point, as that of a great military authority, is\r\nmost instructive, since his object was at first only to educate cadets\r\n_before_ their entrance to the army, but was afterwards extended to\r\ncompleting the education of officers already on active service. His\r\nviews on the last point were carried out by Scharnhorst. They were the\r\ngerm of the present Prussian military education.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe that the Austrian Succession War and the Seven\r\nYears’ War, the first great wars since Louis XIV., and which broke the\r\nThirty Years’ Peace of the eighteenth century, are periods at which\r\nscientific military education made a great step in Europe. A Treatise of\r\nMarshal Count Beausobre’s on the subject first showed the existing want;\r\nit is entitled “_Utilité d’une Ecole et d’une Académie Militaire, avec\r\ndes Notes, ou l’on traite des Ecoles Militaires de l’Antiquité_”. It\r\nattracted great attention on its appearance. Most of the military\r\nacademies properly so called, date from about this time. The earliest\r\nwarrant for Woolwich, dates in 1741. The Theresianum of Maria Theresa\r\nwas begun at Vienna about 1748. The first French school was the\r\ncelebrated engineer school of Mezières founded in 1749. This was soon\r\nfollowed by the old military school of Paris in 1751, and by the school\r\nfor artillery at La Fère in 1756. Frederick’s own _Ritter Academie_\r\ndates from 1764.\r\n\r\nFrederick began this institution with his usual energy, immediately on\r\nthe close of the Seven Years’ War. “My fire is quenched,” he writes,\r\n“and I am now only busied in improving the practice of my men. * * * *\r\nThe position of the common soldier may be left as it was before the war\r\nbegan, but the position of the officers is a point to which I am\r\ndevoting my utmost care. In order in future to quicken their attention\r\nwhilst on service, and to form their judgment, I have ordered them to\r\nreceive instruction in the art of war, and they will be obliged to give\r\nreasons for all they do. Such a plan, as you will see, my dear friend,\r\nwill not answer with every one; still out of the whole body we shall\r\ncertainly form some men and officers, who will not merely have their\r\npatent as generals to show, (_die nicht blos patentirte Generale\r\nvorstellen_,) but some capacity for the office as well.” He had, in\r\nfact, seen with great admiration the improved military school recently\r\nfounded by Maria Theresa; and as it is best on such points to let this\r\ngreat authority be heard for himself, we shall quote his own words:--\r\n\r\n“In order to neglect nothing bearing on the state of the army, the\r\nEmpress founded near Vienna, (at Wiener Neustadt,) a college where young\r\nnobles were instructed in the whole art of war. She drew to it\r\ndistinguished professors of geometry, fortification, geography, and\r\nhistory, who formed there able pupils, and made it a complete nursery\r\nfor the army. By means of her care, the military service attained in\r\nthat country a degree of perfection which it had never reached under the\r\nEmperors of the House of Austria; and a woman thus carried out designs\r\nworthy of a great man.”\r\n\r\nHis letters show that he contemplated an improved school, and he says to\r\nD’Alembert: “I send you the rules of my academy. As the plan is new,\r\nI beg you to give me your honest opinion of it.” Accordingly, the\r\nacademy was founded. We will describe it in his own words:--\r\n\r\n“An academy was founded at the same time, in which were placed those of\r\nthe cadets who showed most genius. The king himself drew up the rules\r\nfor its form, and gave it a plan of instruction, which stated the\r\nobjects of the studies of the pupils, and of the education they were to\r\nreceive. Professors were chosen from the ablest men who could be found\r\nin Europe, and fifteen young gentlemen were educated under the eyes of\r\nfive instructors. Their whole education tended to form their judgment.\r\nThe academy was successful, and supplied able pupils, who received\r\nappointments in the army.”[4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: “Histoire de mon Temps.”--_Œuvres_, vi., p. 99.]\r\n\r\nThis school, which was opened in 1765, was Frederick’s only foundation\r\nof the kind; he was occupied with it incessantly. The plan of its\r\nstudies was drawn up by his own hand, and we have many of his letters of\r\nencouragement to its pupils or professors. Whether he is writing to\r\nVoltaire, Condorcet, or “My Lord Marischal” Keith, he constantly shows\r\nboth his well-known attention to the economy of his new school, and a\r\npaternal interest in his young cadets and their teachers.[5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: He gives himself, in his forcible style, the reasons\r\n    for his attention to early military schools. He had found his\r\n    young nobility excessively averse to such education. “They shrink\r\n    from the army,” he said, “because in this country it is a real\r\n    training for the character. Nothing is passed over in a young\r\n    officer; he is obliged to maintain a prudent, regular, and\r\n    sensible conduct. . . . . . This is precisely what they dislike,\r\n    and one still hears the absurd and insolent expression, ‘If my boy\r\n    will not work, he will do none the worse for a soldier.’ Yes, he\r\n    may do for a mere man-at-arms (_fantassin_,) but not for an\r\n    officer fit to be advanced to the highest commands, the only end\r\n    of a good soldier’s life, and which requires a really extensive\r\n    knowledge.”--_Œuvres_, ix., 117, 120.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, both in professors and pupils, the new institution soon\r\ngained an European character. Out of its twenty first directors, no less\r\nthan ten were distinguished foreigners; one of the best teachers at\r\nBerlin was D’Antoni, a distinguished soldier from the Turin institution\r\nand the artillery school at Alessandria--schools which were still the\r\nrepresentatives of the military science of the great Italian generals,\r\nof the Duke of Parma, of Spinola, and Montecuculi.\r\n\r\nThis institution was still, as it would appear, upon the old principle\r\nof juvenile army schools, nor does Frederick seem to have set on foot\r\nany school for officers after entering the service. But he evidently\r\nfelt strongly the need of improving his staff officers, and of raising\r\nthe science of his artillery and engineers. Thus we find him referring\r\nto the French engineer school at Meziéres; and he endeavored to raise\r\nthe intelligence and education of his officers. It may, however, be\r\nsuspected that the spirit of the “Potsdamer Côterie,” as it was called,\r\nbecame gradually, and particularly after Frederick’s death, too literary\r\nand speculative to suit the rough work of war; and it may, perhaps, be\r\nthought that some defect of this kind is still traceable in the\r\nexcessive amount of teaching and the abstract nature of some of the\r\nsubjects taught in the staff school at Berlin.\r\n\r\nSuch seems to have been the opinion of Scharnhorst, the virtual author\r\nof the present system of army education, and whom the Prussians still\r\nregard as their first authority on that subject. “Instruction is given,”\r\nhe says, “at the military school in all literature, in philosophy, and\r\nin many various sciences. Frederick seems to have wished to lay in it\r\nthe foundation of the education at once of an officer and of a learned\r\nman. Few men, however, are able to excel at once in various branches of\r\nhuman knowledge, and the surest means to do so in _one_ is not to\r\nattempt it in _many_.”\r\n\r\nWe have referred to Frederick and his school rather to show the interest\r\nhe felt in military education, than because his institution was very\r\nimportant. Military education was still very imperfect, and it\r\ncompletely languished in Prussia till Scharnhorst established it on its\r\npresent footing.\r\n\r\nScharnhorst was himself an Hanoverian, but entered the Prussian service,\r\nand had seen by experience the defects of their system in the campaigns\r\nof 1792, 1793, and 1805. He had long devoted especial attention to\r\nmilitary education and to all the scientific part of his profession.\r\nAlong with Blucher and Gneisenau, he was considered one of the first\r\ngenerals of the army, and, on the exhaustion of Prussia after Jena, he\r\nwas selected to remodel its whole system. He did not live to complete\r\nhis work, having been killed early in 1812; but his statue near the\r\nbridge at Berlin, remarkable for its noble and thoughtful expression,\r\nrecords the gratitude of Prussia to its greatest scientific soldier.\r\n\r\n“The perfection of the French military organization,” says Mr. Alison,\r\n“appeared to him in painful contrast beside the numerous defects of that\r\nover which he presided. * * * * Boldly applying to the military\r\ndepartment the admirable principles by which Stein had secured the\r\naffections of the burgher classes, he threw open to the whole of the\r\ncitizens the higher grades of the army, from which they had been\r\nhitherto excluded. * * * * And every department of the public service\r\nunderwent his searching eye.”\r\n\r\nThe work began with the commission of 1807, of which both Stein and\r\nScharnhorst were members. And the regulation of 1808 laid down the\r\nprinciple broadly, that the only claim to an officer’s commission must\r\nbe, “in time of peace, knowledge and education; in war, courage and\r\nconduct.”\r\n\r\nOn these principles, during the next three years, Scharnhorst laid the\r\nfoundations of the present education. He abolished most of the existing\r\njuvenile schools, with the exception only of the Cadet Houses, intended\r\nalmost solely for the sons of officers. He changed the previous war\r\nschool into a sort of school _d’Elite_, consisting of a senior and\r\njunior department, in which the younger soldiers of all arms were to be\r\nimbued with such knowledge as might give them a scientific interest in\r\ntheir profession, and in which senior officers (also of all arms) were\r\nto have a higher course of a similar nature, success in which was to\r\nform a recommendation for employment on the staff. He began the plan of\r\nthe division schools, where all candidates for commissions, but not yet\r\nofficers, might conduct their military studies along with the practice\r\nof their profession. Its idea was to make some military study\r\n_necessary_, and successful study _honorable_, in the army. Finally, he\r\nbegan the present system of careful examination on entering the army.\r\n\r\nThe following historical notice of the origin and successive changes of\r\nthe division schools is taken from a communication by Col. Von Holleben,\r\nand a member of the General Inspection of Military Instruction to the\r\nEnglish Commission.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet order of the 6th of August, 1808, laid the foundation of the\r\npresent system of military education. It regulates the appointment of\r\nSwordknot ensigns and the selection of officers, and declares that the\r\nonly title to an officer’s commission in time of peace shall be\r\nprofessional knowledge and education, and in time of war distinguished\r\nvalor and ability.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet order of the 6th of August, 1808, could only come gradually\r\ninto operation; the system of military examinations had to be created,\r\nand the educational institutions had to receive a new organization,\r\nunder the superintendence of a general officer. Four provincial boards\r\nof examination were successively established, and on the 1st December,\r\n1809, a body of instructions, still very vague and general, was issued\r\nfor their guidance.\r\n\r\nA cabinet order of the 3rd of May, 1810, remodeled the military schools,\r\ndirecting, in addition to the cadet schools at Berlin and Stolpe, the\r\nformation of three military schools for Swordknot ensigns,\r\n(_Portepée-Fähnriche_,) one at Berlin for the marches (_Die Marken_,)\r\nand Pomerania, a second at Königsberg, for east and west Prussia, and a\r\nthird at Breslau, for Silesia; and the formation of a military school at\r\nBerlin for officers. All these institutions were placed under the\r\ngeneral superintendence of Lieutenant-General Von Diericke, who had also\r\nthe special superintendence of the boards of examination. A board of\r\nmilitary studies was created and intrusted, under his control, with the\r\ntask of carrying the regulations into effect.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, the new institutions attained to any stability the war\r\nyears of 1813-14-15 intervened, and the operations of the board of\r\nexaminations ceased.\r\n\r\nSoon after the conclusion of peace directions were given that the\r\nexaminations should recommence, with an equitable consideration of the\r\nclaims of the Landwehr officers, ensigns, and other young persons who\r\nhad grown up during the war.\r\n\r\nAt first there was only one board of examination at Berlin, with large\r\ndiscretionary powers as to their mode of procedure. In April, 1816, a\r\ncabinet order was issued to form boards of examination for the Swordknot\r\nat every brigade, as the present divisions were then called, besides the\r\nexisting board at Berlin, for the examination for an officer’s\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with the nine boards of examination, the board of\r\nmilitary studies, by an order of January, 1816, directed the\r\nestablishment of schools for every brigade, and attempted to gradually\r\nregulate the instruction they gave. The schools contained two classes,\r\nthe lower to prepare candidates for the Swordknot, the higher to prepare\r\ncandidates for the rank of officer. As, however, no standard of\r\nattainment was required for admission into the schools, their\r\ninstruction had to commence with the first elements, and was charged\r\nwith more work than it could perform. The weaker scholars stayed two,\r\nthree, or more years in the lower class, and the education of the better\r\nscholars was impeded.\r\n\r\nDuring this and the following period the authority over the examination\r\nboards (the _Præsidium_,) was distinct from that over the schools, (the\r\ngeneral inspection,) and it was not till later that both authorities\r\nwere vested in a single person. This division of powers, intended to\r\nsecure the independence and impartiality of the examinations, led to the\r\nresult that the two authorities were occasionally led, from a difference\r\nof principles, to labor in different directions. Still, in the infancy\r\nof military education, the rivalry it occasioned, was favorable to a\r\nrapidity of development.\r\n\r\nAn order of the 16th of March, 1827, added French to the studies for the\r\nensigns’ examination, and fixed a higher standard of attainments in\r\nmilitary sciences for the officers’ examination.\r\n\r\nNearly at the same time, a cabinet order of the 27th of March, 1827,\r\ndirected that there should be only one class for Swordknot ensigns in\r\nthe division schools, and that after October, 1829, the candidate should\r\nobtain a testimonial of fitness for the rank of Swordknot ensign\r\nprevious to admission as a student.\r\n\r\nAccordingly young men had to be prepared for examination for the\r\nSwordknot at their entrance into their corps, or might prepare\r\nthemselves by private studies and instruction during their service.\r\n\r\nThe task of the schools, still very comprehensive embracing all the\r\nliberal sciences as well as the military, was accomplished during this\r\nperiod in two courses of nine months, in a higher and a lower class.\r\n\r\nA cabinet order of the 31st of January, 1837, introduced the entrance\r\nexamination, instead of the examination for the Swordknot, being\r\ndeclared that every candidate for the commission of an officer, after\r\nhis reception into a corps, should prove in an examination his\r\npossession of the knowledge requisite for a Swordknot ensigncy before\r\nhis actual appointment. At the same time a regulation of the ministry of\r\nwar, of the 17th of December 1836, remodeled and more precisely defined\r\nboth the entrance (Swordknot ensign) examination, and that for the\r\ncommission of an officer. This regulation, while it essentially modified\r\nthe instruction given at the division schools, furnished them at the\r\nsame time with a more certain clue for their guidance. The preparation\r\nof youths for the Swordknot examination during their service in the\r\ncorps was discontinued. But the standard of the entrance examination was\r\nstill too low, requiring only a small portion of the branches of a\r\ngeneral liberal education, and that not in the shape in which they are\r\ntaught in our gymnasia. Hence the evil result, that young men, previous\r\nto their entrance into a corps, had usually to prepare for the military\r\nprofession at private institutions instead of at the gymnasia, and\r\nnevertheless brought with them a very defective amount of preparatory\r\ntraining; on the other hand, the demands of the officers’ examination\r\nwere very multifarious. It still required the general scholastic\r\nsciences by way of formal education, and the military sciences as a\r\nspecial education for the military profession. Thus the task of the\r\ndivision schools continued overwhelming, and an aim was set before them\r\nwhich they could not attain.\r\n\r\nA regulation of the 4th of February, 1844, reformed simultaneously the\r\nwhole system of military examination and education.\r\n\r\nThe views which guided these reforms, the improvements and advantages\r\nwhich were hoped to be thereby obtained, were, in general, the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n1. The military profession, like every other, requires a general school\r\neducation intended generally to cultivate the mind, distinct from the\r\nsubsequent special and professional education for which the former is\r\nthe necessary groundwork.\r\n\r\nThe former is tested in the examination for the Swordknot, the latter in\r\nthe officers’ examination.\r\n\r\n2. The preparatory education required from the candidate for a Swordknot\r\nis the function of the ordinary schools of the country. Nothing but what\r\nthey can impart is required, and from consideration of the youthful age\r\nof the candidates (seventeen years,) the amount of preparatory training\r\nrequired is not the attainment of the highest class of the gymnasium,\r\nbut only that required for admission into the Prima.\r\n\r\n3. The required previous training not only gives the candidate a more\r\ncertain basis for his subsequent military education, but, as being the\r\ngroundwork of all professions, leaves him afterwards at liberty to\r\ncultivate the special knowledge requisite for any profession that he may\r\nprefer.\r\n\r\n4. The division schools are freed from a multifarious course of\r\ninstruction in the scholastic sciences, a task beyond their power: the\r\nresult of which was that the majority of scholars were very little\r\nadvanced in formal and general education, and but superficially grounded\r\nin the elements of the professional sciences, while they spent years in\r\nbeing drilled for an examination, instead of being educated for life.\r\n\r\n5. If the division schools have an able staff of military teachers, they\r\ncan give a good professional education. The younger officers, even if\r\nthey never received the full training of the gymnasium, may still, by\r\ntheir professional training, raise themselves above their subordinates,\r\n(a class in Prussia often highly educated,) and are started with an\r\nexcellent preparation for their professional career.\r\n\r\n6. By the amount of liberal education required in the examination for\r\nthe Swordknot, the friends of those destined for the military profession\r\nare admonished to provide them an education equal to that received by\r\nthe members of other professions.\r\n\r\n7. By the method pursued in the examinations the power is retained of\r\nraising or lowering the standard according to circumstances. When the\r\nsupply of officers is deficient, the standard can be lowered; at other\r\ntimes, as at present, it may be raised. Since the above-mentioned\r\nregulations, the following essential alterations have been introduced:--\r\n\r\n1. The examination for the Swordknot is again placed after admission\r\ninto the corps, but no one can be admitted to attend the division\r\nschools without a testimonial of fitness for the rank of Swordknot\r\nensign.\r\n\r\n2. A testimonial of fitness for the university, _i.e._, to have passed\r\nthe abiturient examination, dispenses with the examination for the\r\nSwordknot. In consequence of this rule fifty abiturients on an average\r\nannually enter the army. These, as well as the selectaner of the cadet\r\ncorps, must be considered, in point of scientific education, an\r\nexcellent supply of officers. From the powerful impulse that military\r\ninstruction has received in the last fifty years, it may be expected\r\nthat the time is not distant when the candidate for an officer’s\r\ncommission, instead of passing the Swordknot examination, will have to\r\nbring the finished training of the gymnasium; in other words, to have\r\npassed the abiturient examination.\r\n\r\n3. Instead of the seventeen division schools there are now by the\r\nregulation of 1844, only nine, and a further reduction of their number\r\nto four or three is contemplated, with an improvement of the staff of\r\nteachers and a stricter supervision of the scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. SYSTEM OF MILITARY EDUCATION AND PROMOTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe standing army composed in the manner and under the circumstances\r\nalready described, is supplied with officers who must have a good\r\ngeneral education, and have served in the ranks, or have obtained a\r\ncertain amount of professional instruction. The usual course is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nYoung men obtain a nomination from the colonel of a regiment. This\r\nnomination admits them merely to service in the regiment as privates,\r\nwith a recognition of their being candidates, _aspiranten_ or aspirants,\r\nfor the rank of officer. Before they obtain that rank, the following\r\nconditions must be fulfilled. They must pass an examination in the\r\ncommon subjects of a good general education, such as the sons of\r\nwell-born or wealthy civilians may be supposed to receive. They must\r\nserve six or nine months with the troops; they must attend nine months\r\nat a division school, or twelve months in the artillery and engineer\r\nschool, where they receive a course of special military instruction; and\r\nthey must pass an examination in professional subjects before a board\r\nsitting at Berlin. They are then eligible for a vacancy. In order to\r\nobtain a commission they require further the recommendation of the\r\nofficers of the regiment.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious to remark, that in obtaining a commission in the Prussian\r\nservice the candidate’s chance depends greatly on the recommendation of\r\nthe colonel and the after assent of the officers. The effect of this is\r\nto maintain an exclusive character in the army. Above two-thirds of the\r\ncommissions are obtained by the course described above; the remainder\r\nare granted to those who pass through the cadet schools.\r\n\r\nOf these there are five altogether, four junior establishments, situated\r\nin certain provincial towns, and one senior or upper school at Berlin,\r\nto which the others are merely preparatory. They are all supported by\r\nthe state; mainly for the purpose of educating the children of\r\nmeritorious officers in want of assistance; but they are also open to\r\nothers. With the exception of the highest class of the upper school, the\r\n_Selecta_ above mentioned, the instruction given is of a perfectly\r\ngeneral character, and there is no obligation even for those who have\r\nreceived the most ample pecuniary assistance to enter the military\r\nprofession. The discipline, however, is military, the teachers are\r\nmostly officers, the pupils are regularly drilled, and most of them\r\nactually go into the army. This they do in ordinary cases without going\r\nthrough the highest or select class in which professional instruction is\r\ngiven; they merely pass the same preliminary examination as the\r\ncandidates nominated by the colonels of regiments; they enter the army\r\nwithout their commissions, and have to obtain them in the same manner as\r\nthe other candidates, by serving six or nine months with the troops, and\r\nby following their professional studies in the division or artillery and\r\nengineer schools, and by passing the officers’ or second examination\r\nbefore the examining board at Berlin. Those who do remain to go through\r\nthe highest or select class receive their professional instruction in it\r\ninstead of in the division or artillery and engineer schools, and they\r\nare examined for their commissions by the board while still at the cadet\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThus, in the course usually followed, three requisites are exacted in\r\nPrussia before a commission is given; first, a good general education;\r\nsecondly, some actual military service; and, thirdly, professional\r\nknowledge gained by something like a year of military study. But the\r\nmilitary service is not required from the upper thirty students of the\r\n_Selecta_ of the Cadet House.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to mention, at the commencement, the names of the two\r\nexaminations. The first, the preliminary examination, merely testing the\r\ngeneral education, admits to a particular grade among non-commissioned\r\nofficers; those holding it rank between sergeants and corporals, and in\r\nconsideration of their being candidates (_aspiranten_) for a commission\r\nwear a different sword-knot, and hence have the name of Swordknot ensign\r\nor _Portepée-fähnrich_. The first or preliminary examination is\r\naccordingly called the _Portepée-fähnrich_ examination. The second, the\r\nprofessional one, is the officers’ examination, for the commission of\r\nsecond lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThese two examinations, for the grade of _Portepée-fähnrich_ and for the\r\nofficer’s commission, are either conducted or controlled by the Supreme\r\nMilitary examinations Board, (_Ober-Militair-Examinations-Commission_)\r\nin Berlin, a body partly composed of military officers, partly of\r\neminent civilians.\r\n\r\nThe various examining boards, the central and the local ones, which\r\nconduct these two examinations, are quite independent of the military\r\nschools, and were formerly presided over by a different head; but in\r\norder that the system should be uniformly carried out, and as Colonel\r\nvon Holleben expresses it, that “_the examinations should exercise a\r\nsalutary influence on education, and that their standard should be\r\nadjusted to the capacities of the schools_,” they have now been placed\r\nunder the same control as the military schools.\r\n\r\nThe whole department of military education is therefore now under the\r\ncontrol of a single high functionary, bearing the title of the general\r\ninspector of the military schools, military education, and military\r\nstudies (_das Militair Erziehungs-und-Bildungswesen_,) who reports\r\ndirect to the king on all subjects relating to examination and\r\ninstruction. He submits his proposals on matters of administration to\r\nthe minister of war, who issues the necessary orders to the boards\r\ncharged with the financial control of the various schools.\r\n\r\nThe general inspector is assisted by a supreme council or board of\r\nmilitary studies, composed of field officers of the general staff and of\r\nthe special arms, the directors of the war school, of the supreme board\r\nof military examinations, of the artillery and engineers school, the\r\ncommander of the cadet corps, some of the consultative assessors\r\n(_Vortragenden Räthen_,) of the minister of worship, and of individuals\r\nselected from the general body of learned men (professors.)\r\n\r\nThe principal military schools of Prussia may be divided into five\r\nclasses:--\r\n\r\nI. Those which give a good general education to the sons of meritorious\r\nofficers, but which are open to others, such as--\r\n\r\n1. The Cadet Houses or Cadet Schools (_Cadetten-Häuser_,) which supply a\r\ncertain amount of instruction in military professional subjects.\r\n\r\nII. Such as supply professional instruction to young men who are\r\ncandidates for the rank of officer in the Prussian army. These are--\r\n\r\n2. The Division Schools (_Divisions-Schule_,) nine in number, one for\r\neach army corps.\r\n\r\n3. The artillery and engineers schools in Berlin.\r\n\r\nIII. Those which afford professional instruction to officers already in\r\nthe service, to qualify them for special duty, limited to--\r\n\r\n4. The War School or Staff School (_Kriegs-Schule_,) in Berlin.\r\n\r\nIV. Those intended to give special instruction for the training of\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men. Such as--\r\n\r\n5. The School Division or Non-commissioned Officers School\r\n(_Schulabtheilung_,) at Potsdam.\r\n\r\n6. The Regimental Schools (_Regiments und Bataillons Schulen_.)\r\n\r\n7. The Music and the Swimming Schools, and the Central Gymnastic School\r\nin Berlin (_Central Turn-Anstalt_.)\r\n\r\n8. The Veterinary School (_Thierarzeneischule_.)\r\n\r\nV. Those intended to give gratuitous education to the children, boys and\r\ngirls, of non-commissioned officers and soldiers, whose parents are too\r\npoor to provide for them. Such are,--\r\n\r\n9. The Military Orphan Houses (_Militair-Waisenhäuser_,) at Annaburg,\r\nPotsdam, and Pretzsch.\r\n\r\n10. The schools for soldiers’ children.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these might be mentioned the Medical Institution,\r\nparticularly the Frederick-William’s Institution at Berlin, and the\r\nKnight Academy (_Ritter-Academie_,) or Noble School, in Liegnitz.\r\n\r\nThe annual cost to the state of the military schools in 1856, appears to\r\nbe as follows:--\r\n\r\n  [KEY]\r\n  S Salaries.

The pay\r\nof the student officers, and the pay and allowances of the military\r\nprofessors and teachers, are, however, drawn from their corps, so that\r\nthe above-mentioned seems only to include the extra pay granted to the\r\nprofessors, &c.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the Non-commissioned Officers School, of the military\r\norphan houses, and of the schools for soldiers’ children, are not given\r\nin the printed paper from which these details have been extracted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. EXAMINATIONS--GENERAL AND PROFESSIONAL--FOR A COMMISSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo examinations, one in general and the other in professional knowledge\r\nare required of all candidates for a commission upon or soon after their\r\nentrance into the army, unless they can bring a certificate of having\r\nsuccessfully completed the regular course of a gymnasium, in which case\r\nthey are excused from the first.\r\n\r\nThese two examinations, through which alone admission is obtained to the\r\nrank of officer, are so important, and hold so prominent a position in\r\nthe Prussian military system, that we propose to preface our account of\r\nthe nature and extent of each of these examinations by a short tabular\r\nstatement of the circumstances under which the candidates for each arm\r\nof the service respectively pass them.\r\n\r\n  The following Candidates offer themselves,\r\n      for the Preliminary, Ensign’s, or _Portepée-fähnrich_\r\n      Examination,\r\n          for the Second or Officer’s Examination (in all cases before\r\n          the Supreme Board at Berlin.)\r\n\r\n  Those presented by the Colonels of Regiments,\r\n      Before, after, or during (usually before) six months’ service\r\n      with the Troops, before the local Division Board;\r\n          After nine months’ military instruction in the Division\r\n          School.\r\n  Those coming at the usual time from the Cadet House (from the class\r\n  called _Prima_,)\r\n      On quitting the Cadet House, before the Supreme Board at Berlin;\r\n          After six months’ service with the troops, and nine months’\r\n          military instruction in the Division School.\r\n  Those who stay an extra year in the Special or Select class\r\n  (_Selecta_) of the Cadet House,\r\n      Before admission to the Special or Select class (_Selecta_,)\r\n      before the Supreme Board at Berlin;\r\n          On quitting the Cadet House, after one year’s instruction in\r\n          the Select class _Selecta_.\r\n  Those for the Artillery or Engineers, except when they came from\r\n  the Special or Select class, (_Selecta_,)  of the Cadet House,\r\n      After nine months’ service with the Troops, and three months’\r\n      stay at the Artillery and Engineers School, before the Supreme\r\n      Board at Berlin;\r\n          After one year’s stay at the Artillery and Engineers School.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _The Preliminary or Ensign’s (Portepée-fähnrich) Examination._\r\n\r\nAccording to a special law, any young man above seventeen and a half and\r\nunder twenty-three years of age, whether he be a private or a corporal,\r\nif he has served six months in the army, and can obtain from the\r\nofficers of his company a certificate of good conduct, attention, and\r\nknowledge of his profession, may claim to be examined for the grade of\r\nensign or (_Portepée-fähnrich_.) If he succeed in this examination, he\r\nis recognized as a candidate, an _aspirant_ for a commission; but his\r\nprospect of obtaining a commission is subject to a variety of subsequent\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn practice, a young man who aspires to a commission applies to the\r\ncolonel of the regiment and usually obtains a nomination before he\r\nactually joins; and, as the examination is entirely of a civil\r\ncharacter, he is usually glad to try and pass it at once. Having\r\nrecently come from school, he feels probably better prepared than he is\r\nlikely to be at any subsequent time: for on joining the corps, he will\r\nhave for some time to conform to the life of a private soldier, to sleep\r\nand mess with the men, and to mount guard in his turn; and with the\r\ndrill and exercises, and the marching and manoeuvring with the troops,\r\nhe will have enough to occupy him to prevent his preparing for the\r\nexamination. The two qualifications for the ensign’s grade are, the test\r\nof the examination and the six months’ service; but it appears to be\r\nindifferent in what order they are taken, whether service comes first\r\nand examination after, or _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nThe examinations take place quarterly, at the beginning of every\r\nJanuary, April, July, and October. They are held in the great garrison\r\ntowns by local military boards, consisting of a president and five\r\nexaminers. Applications for permission to be examined must be made at\r\nleast a fortnight before, and must be accompanied by certificates\r\nstating the candidate’s birth, parentage, &c.; certificates of diligence\r\nand good conduct from the schoolmasters or other teachers who have\r\ninstructed him; and of bodily fitness from an army surgeon.\r\n\r\nThe local board of examiners is appointed by the general officer in\r\ncommand of the army corps, the centers of examination corresponding in\r\npresent practice with the localities assigned to the division or\r\narmy-corps schools, nine in number, presently to be described.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the examination is on paper; a _vivâ voce_ examination\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nOn paper the young men have to write three themes or compositions in\r\nGerman, to translate two passages, one from Livy or Sallust, another\r\nfrom Cæsar’s Commentaries, Cicero’s Epistles, or Quintus Curtius; to\r\ntranslate sixteen or twenty lines from French into German, and two\r\npassages, a longer and a shorter, from German into French. They have one\r\nquestion in common arithmetic, one in equations, progressions, or\r\nlogarithms; one in geometry, one in trigonometry; they have one in\r\nmathematical or physical geography, one in the general geography of\r\nEurope and its colonies, and one in that of Germany and Prussia. There\r\nis one question in Greek or Roman history; one in the earlier German\r\nhistory; one in modern; and one in Prussian history. They have also to\r\nshow that they are acquainted with the common conventional signs used in\r\nrepresenting the surface of the earth in maps; and they have to copy a\r\nsmall map of a group of hills.\r\n\r\nThe time allowed for each question is about three quarters of an hour or\r\nan hour; for each German theme, it is as much as an hour and a half or\r\ntwo hours.\r\n\r\nThe questions are of a comprehensive character; _e.g._ Give a history of\r\nthe campaign of 1813, or of the life of Alexander the Great; enumerate\r\nthe rivers flowing into the Mediterranean Sea, with the principal towns\r\nsituated upon each of them. The German themes are, first, a _curriculum\r\nvitæ_, an account of the candidate’s life, which is, however, not\r\nsupposed to count in the result, and is merely for the examiner’s\r\ninformation; second and third, two themes on some sentence or proverb,\r\nfor the first of which the examiner assists the candidate by _vivâ voce_\r\nquestions and corrections in drawing up the preliminary outline of\r\narrangement; for the second he is left entirely to himself.\r\n\r\nThere is a subsequent _vivâ voce_ examination in all the subjects,\r\ndrawing excepted. The candidates are taken in small classes, not\r\nexceeding seven in number, and are examined together, but not in public.\r\n\r\nThe results of the examination are considered according to the system of\r\n_predicates_ or epithets, sometimes also called _censures_. The\r\ncandidates’ answers are characterized as excellent (_vorzüglich_,) good\r\n(_gut_,) satisfactory (_befriedigend_,) insufficient (_nicht\r\nhinreichend_,) or unsatisfactory (_ungenügend_.) Numerical values are\r\nattached to each of these epithets; “excellent” is marked with 9;\r\n“unsatisfactory” counts as 1; and according to the amount of importance\r\nattached to the different subjects the marks thus given are multiplied\r\nby a higher or lower number, by 5 in one case, by 3 or by 1 in others.\r\nGerman, Latin, and mathematics have all the highest estimate of 5, and\r\nare each five times more important than drawing, which is marked by 1;\r\ngeography, history, and French, are each valued at 3. A young man who\r\ngets the _predicate_ “excellent,” in German, will receive 45 marks, his\r\n9 being multiplied by 5; whereas the same predicate for history would\r\nobtain him only 15, and in drawing only 5 marks.\r\n\r\n  German,            5 }\r\n  Latin,             5 }\r\n  Mathematics,       5 }\r\n  History,           3 } Total, 25.\r\n  Geography,         3 }\r\n  French,            3 }\r\n  Drawing,           1 }\r\n\r\nA report is then drawn up, and according to the marks or predicates, the\r\ncandidates are pronounced as admissible with distinction, admissible\r\nwith honor, or simply admissible; or their re-examination after six\r\nmonths, their re-examination after a year, or their absolute rejection,\r\nis recommended.\r\n\r\nThis report, with the candidates’ certificates, is forwarded to the\r\nsupreme military examinations board at Berlin, and, if approved by them,\r\nis submitted in their quarterly report to the king; and the result, when\r\nsanctioned by him, is communicated to the respective corps.\r\n\r\nThe candidates are all informed not only of the practical result, but\r\nalso of the particulars of their examinations; they are told in what\r\nsubjects they have failed, and in what they have succeeded. The\r\ncandidates can not, under any circumstances, try more than three times.\r\n\r\nThe young men who pass, are thus, so far as their qualification in point\r\nof knowledge is concerned, pronounced admissible to the ensign’s grade.\r\nThey have of course to complete their six months’ service with the\r\ntroops. Yet even when this is completed, a vacancy in the list of\r\nensigns must be waited for, and months may pass before the aspirant\r\nreceives the distinctive badge, the special Sword-knot, which marks his\r\nsuperiority to the corporals, and shows that he has gained the first\r\nstep that leads to a commission.\r\n\r\nThe examination that has now been described is obviously one for which\r\npreparation may be made in the common public schools, and under the\r\nusual civilian teachers. A young man of seventeen need not have been\r\npositively destined to the military profession, nor have gone through\r\nspecial preparation for any length of time beforehand. The boards of\r\nlocal military examiners are content to take them as they are offered,\r\ninquiry only being made as to their birth and connections, and their\r\nprevious behavior at school or under tuition.\r\n\r\nIn fact, those who have passed successfully through the full course of a\r\nschool which prepares for the universities (a gymnasium,) are excused\r\nthe ensign’s examination. The certificate they have received on going\r\naway from school, upon the _abiturient’s_ or leaving examination, as it\r\nis called, is considered quite sufficient; except in the case of\r\ncandidates for the artillery or engineers, who are expected to show\r\ngreater proficiency in mathematics; and certainly a boy in the head\r\nclass of a gymnasium ought to be able to pass the preliminary\r\nexamination with perfect ease and with credit. The amount of knowledge\r\nrequired and the particular subjects selected are not those of the\r\nfirst, and are scarcely those of the second class of a gymnasium; and\r\nthe assertion was even made that a boy from the upper third class might\r\nvery well hope to pass for an ensigncy. Possibly a little extra tuition\r\nfrom the preparatory establishments, which are said to have sprung up\r\nwith the special function of “fabricating Fähnrichs” might in this\r\ninstance be required.\r\n\r\nThe official programme is here given, and may be compared with the\r\nstudies prescribed in the upper classes of the Cadet House at Berlin,\r\n(_see_ the account of that school.)\r\n\r\n  1. In their own language, good legible handwriting, a correct style,\r\nfree from orthographical or grammatical mistakes, facility of expression\r\nin writing and speaking; some evidence of a knowledge of German\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n  2. In Latin, facility in understanding the Latin prose writers\r\nordinarily read in the second class of a Prussian gymnasium. A written\r\nexercise in translation from Latin into German; grammatical analysis of\r\nsome passages.\r\n\r\n  3. In French, facility in reading and in translating from German into\r\nFrench, and French into German, grammatical analysis of French\r\nsentences, and a knowledge of syntax.\r\n\r\n  4. Mathematics:--\r\n\r\n    (_a._) Arithmetic and Algebra;--familiarity with the ordinary rules\r\nfor the extraction of the square root of whole numbers and of fractions;\r\nProportion and its applications including questions in Partnership and\r\nCompound Proportion; the theory of powers and roots, with integral and\r\nfractional, positive and negative exponents. Equations of the two first\r\ndegrees, with one or more unknown quantities; Logarithms, Logarithmic\r\nEquations, Arithmetical and Geometrical Progression, and practice in the\r\napplication of the various theories.\r\n\r\n    (_b._) The complete elements of Plane Geometry, measuration of\r\nrectilineal figures and of the circle, transformation and division of\r\nfigures; the first elements of the application of Algebra to Geometry.\r\n\r\n    (_c._) Plane Trigonometry, Trigonometrical functions and their\r\nLogarithms. Use of trigonometrical tables. Calculation of particular\r\ncases of triangles, regular polygons, and segments of circles.\r\n\r\n  In consideration of the especial importance of this discipline for\r\nofficers of the artillery and engineers, a higher predicate (_i.e._ a\r\ngreater number of marks) will be required in the exercises of candidates\r\nfor these two services; the knowledge expected in their case will be,\r\nthough not more extensive, more thorough and deep.\r\n\r\n  5. Geography:--The general principles of Mathematical and Physical\r\nGeography, knowledge of our planetary system, of the motions of the\r\nEarth, and of the phenomena immediately dependent upon them. Readiness\r\nin drawing from memory the outlines of the more important countries,\r\nwith their principal mountains, rivers, and cities. General outlines of\r\nPolitical Geography, in the case of the mere states out of Europe; a\r\ndetailed account of the elements of European statistics, more\r\nparticularly in the case of Germany and Prussia.\r\n\r\n  6. History:--A knowledge of the more remarkable events in the history\r\nof great nations, of the general connection, causes, and consequences of\r\nthese events; a knowledge of the remarkable men of all such nations down\r\nto the present time. Special knowledge of the history of Greece, Rome,\r\nGermany, Prussia, with particular reference in this last case to its\r\nexternal growth, inner development, and to the principal events of the\r\nmost important wars since the middle of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n  7. Readiness in general drawing, and in constructing mathematical\r\nfigures; some skill in drawing plans of positions and mountains, in the\r\nway of preparation for military plan drawing.\r\n\r\n  8. The candidate may, in addition, be examined in other subjects, in\r\nwhich his certificates show that he has been instructed; for example, in\r\nNatural Philosophy, so far as included in his previous course of\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that either before or after this examination some\r\nmonths must be spent in actual service with the troops by all but the\r\npupils belonging to the _Selecta_ of the cadet school; and that nine\r\nmonths of study at the division and artillery and engineer schools\r\nintervenes before the officers examination takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _The Second or Officer’s Examination._\r\n\r\nThe second or final examination for a commission, which generally ensues\r\nwhen the work of the division school is over, is held in Berlin only,\r\nand is conducted immediately by the central commission, to which\r\nreference has so often been made--the supreme Military Examinations\r\nBoard, the _Ober-Militair-Examinations Commission_. This board or\r\ncommission, a list of the existing members of which is given in page\r\n179, consists, for the purpose now in consideration, of a president and\r\nfive examiners, selected from the larger number to examine candidates\r\nfor commissions.\r\n\r\nThe examinations are held continually; two opportunities are afforded\r\nevery year to the candidates sent from each of the various army corps.\r\nThe requisite papers must be forwarded to the commission eight days at\r\nleast beforehand, and the candidates must appear in Berlin, and take up\r\ntheir quarters in the buildings placed at the disposal of the board on\r\nthe Friday preceding the day fixed for the examination. The examination\r\nusually begins on the following Monday, and lasts through the week. The\r\nexpenses of the journey are allowed, except, perhaps, when the candidate\r\ncomes up a second time.\r\n\r\nThe certificates to be presented are the following:--\r\n\r\n1. The certificate of birth, age, parentage, &c. (This is called the\r\n_Nationale_.)\r\n\r\n2. The _Curriculum Vitæ_, (an account of the circumstances of the\r\ncandidates’s past life, his education, employment, &c., &c.)\r\n\r\n3. The certificate that he has already passed through a previous\r\nexamination (the _Tentamen_,) held by the authorities of the division\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n4. A certificate of conduct during his stay at the division school.\r\n\r\n5. A military drawing (_Croquis_,) with an attestation given by his\r\ninstructor that it is the candidate’s own doing.\r\n\r\nThis examination, like the preliminary one, is partly on paper and\r\npartly oral. General directions are given that the examiners in both\r\ncases shall look mainly to the question whether the candidate has\r\nsufficient positive knowledge of his subjects, and capacity to explain\r\nand express himself, that mere lapses of memory shall not be regarded,\r\nand that natural endowments shall be principally looked to.\r\n\r\nIn the written examination, the candidate has four questions given him\r\nin what is called the knowledge or theory of arms (_Waffenlehre_,)\r\nincluding under that term all kinds of ammunition; three in tactics; one\r\nquestion in the rules and regulations which touch the duty of a\r\nsubaltern officer; two questions in permanent and two in field\r\nfortification; one exercise in surveying, to test his acquaintance with\r\nthe common instruments, and one to try his knowledge of the principles\r\nof plan drawing (_Terrain-Darstellung_;) while his general skill in\r\nmilitary drawing is proved by his either copying a plan placed before\r\nhim, or drawing one from a relief model of a mountainous district (_nach\r\nBergmodellen_.)\r\n\r\nThere is a _vivâ voce_ examination in all the subjects.\r\n\r\nThe commission meets once every month to consider the examinations held\r\nsince their last meeting. The result is announced under the form of the\r\n_predicates_ or epithets already more than once referred to. Honorable\r\nmention is accorded to an _excellent_ examination, and mention to a\r\n_good_ one. If there has been an unsatisfactory result in one of the\r\nsubjects, the candidate may compensate for it by superiority in other\r\nsubjects, but can only in this case be qualified as _satisfactory\r\n(befriedigend,)_ and an adequate knowledge of “arms” and tactics is\r\nregarded as indispensable in candidates for the infantry or cavalry, and\r\nin “arms” and fortification in those for the artillery and engineers. No\r\nsuperior work in other subjects is allowed to make up for a deficiency\r\nin these.\r\n\r\nIf a candidate’s work is marked as _insufficient (nicht hinreichend,)_\r\nhe is sent back for another half-year, and if he has done\r\n_unsatisfactorily_, for a complete year of additional study, with leave\r\nto appear for re-examination after that interval. In a case of\r\nre-examination, the two last _predicates_ (_nicht hinreichend_ and\r\n_ungenügend_) entail final rejection.\r\n\r\nThe report of the board is submitted to the king; the results are\r\ncommunicated to the various corps. The announcements sent to the\r\ncandidates state the predicates assigned to the various portions of\r\ntheir work. Those who have passed, receive certificates of being\r\nqualified for the second lieutenant’s commission:--\r\n\r\nThis rank, however, is not immediately granted. A vacancy may be long in\r\noccurring, and must be waited for. Promotion is given according to their\r\nseniority on the list of ensigns in the regiment. Another condition must\r\nalso be satisfied. When a vacancy occurs, the senior ensign’s name can\r\nnot be submitted to the king for his appointment without a document\r\nstating on the part of the officers of the regiment that he has the\r\nrequisite knowledge of the duties of the service, and that they consider\r\nhim worthy of admission amongst them (_würdig in seine Mitte zu\r\ntreten_.) If the majority is opposed to his admission, the name of the\r\nnext ensign in order of seniority is, without further discussion,\r\nbrought forward; if a minority or merely some individual officers take\r\nexception, they state the grounds of their opinion, which are then\r\nsubmitted for consideration.[6]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: This certificate, according to a statement received\r\n    in conversation, is in the first instance from the officers of the\r\n    company, to the effect that the ensign in question is well\r\n    conducted and likely to be a desirable addition to their number;\r\n    then from the major of the battalion, and from the colonel of the\r\n    regiment.]\r\n\r\nSpecial merit in the examination may be, at the king’s pleasure, held a\r\nsufficient reason for promotion before all candidates examined at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nThe following is the programme of the studies, proficiency in which is\r\nexpected of candidates at the second or officer’s examination:--\r\n\r\n  I.

MILITARY SCHOOLS FOR PREPARING OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Cadet Schools or Cadet Houses._\r\n\r\nThe actual military education of Prussia commences with the cadet\r\nhouses, the schools intended for pupils before entering the army. They\r\nare divided into two classes, the junior and the senior. They can not\r\nindeed be called exclusively military schools, since the education which\r\nmost of their pupils receive is one which fits them for civil\r\nprofessions, and is not specially military; and there is no obligation\r\neven on those who have received the largest amount of pecuniary\r\nassistance to enter the military profession when they leave the cadet\r\nhouse. The highest class, however, of the Upper Cadet School of Berlin,\r\ncalled the _Selecta_, receives strictly military teaching for a year,\r\nand the schools may fairly come under this denomination, as being mainly\r\nintended to educate the sons of officers who are in want of assistance,\r\nand as possessing a military discipline, uniform, and spirit.\r\n\r\nThese are five in number, four preparatory schools, and one a finishing\r\ninstitution; the four first in the provinces, at Culm, Potsdam,\r\nWahlstatt, and Bensberg, the last in the capital itself. At the four\r\njunior schools, boys may be admitted at 10 or 11, and may remain till\r\n15; at the upper school the ordinary stay is from 15 or 16 to 18 or 19.\r\n\r\nThe whole constitute together a single body, called the cadet corps.\r\nBoys may enter the school at Berlin on passing an examination, without\r\npreviously attending one of the lower schools; but those who are sent up\r\nby the authorities from Culm, Potsdam, Wahlstatt, and Bensberg, are\r\nreceived without examination, being already members of the corps.\r\nA single officer exercises the command of the whole; and a single\r\ncommission, of which the general inspector is chairman, regulates all\r\nmatters relating to the admission of candidates into the body.\r\n\r\nThe whole number at present is between 1,100 and 1,200, of whom 420 are\r\nin the Upper School at Berlin, 205 in the Preparatory School at Potsdam,\r\nand 200 at each of the other houses.\r\n\r\nThe cadets are of two kinds, the King’s cadets and the Pensioners or\r\npaying pupils; the former are 720 in number, the latter about 420. The\r\npensioners pay 200 dollars (30_l._) a year for board and instruction\r\ntogether; the King’s cadets are aided in various degrees accordingly to\r\nthe following scale:--\r\n\r\n  240 pay 30 dollars (4_l._ 10_s._) each.\r\n  240 pay 60 dollars (9_l._) each.\r\n  240 pay 100 dollars (15_l._) each.\r\n\r\nForeigners are admissible at a yearly payment of 300 dollars (45_l._,)\r\nand a few extra day scholars (_Hospitanten_,) when the classes are not\r\ntoo full, are received for 20 dollars a year (3_l._)\r\n\r\nThe King’s cadetships are granted, according to the pecuniary\r\ncircumstances of the applicants, to the children of officers of the\r\nstanding army, or of the Landwehr, who have distinguished themselves or\r\nhave been invalided in actual service in the field; to the children of\r\nnon-commissioned officers who have in like manner distinguished\r\nthemselves and received severe wounds in the service; and to those of\r\nany citizens who have performed any special service to the state. The\r\nsons of meritorious officers who have died in indigence or have retired\r\nupon pensions, the sons of indigent officers in general in the standing\r\narmy, and the sons of meritorious non-commissioned officers of\r\ntwenty-five years’ standing, are also in like manner eligible.\r\n\r\nIn very special cases of poverty, the supplementary payment is dispensed\r\nwith altogether.\r\n\r\nPensioners are admitted from all classes and professions according to\r\npriority of application, and to their qualifications as shown by their\r\nexamination. A great number of these are said to be the sons of\r\nofficers, of those, namely, who are not in need of pecuniary assistance.\r\nAnd the number of the pensioners generally appears to be steadily on the\r\nincrease. In the regulations printed in 1850, the places open for this\r\nclass of cadets are stated to be only 216; at present, as has been seen,\r\nprovision is made for something like double that number.\r\n\r\nThe four junior schools at Culm, Potsdam, Wahlstatt, and Bensberg, are\r\nall divided for purposes of instruction upon the same uniform plan into\r\nfour classes, numbered up from six to three--_Sexta_ at the bottom;\r\n_Quinta_; _Quarta_; and _Tertia_ at the top. The upper school at Berlin\r\nsucceeds with three classes, the second, the first, and the special or\r\nselect--_Secunda_, _Prima_, and _Selecta_. Each of these classes,\r\nhowever, may contain any number of co-ordinate subdivisions, all taught\r\nthe same subjects, and presumed to contain pupils of the same capacity.\r\nNo teacher, it is considered, can satisfactorily undertake to give a\r\nlesson to more than thirty at a time; and the Secunda at Berlin was thus\r\nparted out in the year ending March, 1856, into eight little sets of\r\nrather less than thirty, the Prima into six, and the Selecta into two.\r\n\r\n_Junior Cadet House._\r\n\r\nThe junior cadet house at Potsdam occupies four or five buildings a\r\nlittle way out of the town. The class-rooms are on the usual Prussian\r\nplan, not arranged for lectures to large, but for lessons with small\r\nnumbers. One distinguishing feature is the character of the arrangements\r\nof the rooms up-stairs, in which the boys pass their time out of school\r\nhours. They are very comfortable chambers, perhaps rather small for the\r\nnumbers at present placed in them; they are ranged along a corridor; ten\r\npupils are placed in each, and between every two rooms is the apartment\r\nof one of the resident tutors (_Erzieher_ or _Gouverneur_,) who sees\r\nthat all goes on right in these two rooms under his charge. Here the\r\nboys sit and work, and during the hours when they are expected to be\r\npreparing their lessons, are carefully looked after by their tutors.\r\n\r\nThese little apartments occupy one whole floor of the building. The\r\nfloor above is that of the dormitories, containing each, perhaps, as\r\nmany as sixty. The number at present in the school was stated to be two\r\nhundred and five, and the accommodation properly intended for only one\r\nhundred and sixty.\r\n\r\nColonel von Rosenberg, the commandant of the school, stated that eleven\r\nwas the usual age at which the pupils came. This he appeared to think\r\nwas rather too early, and he was inclined to attribute to this cause\r\ncertain points in the character of young men who have been educated in\r\nthe cadet corps. Eighty of his two hundred and five pupils were\r\npensioners, or paying pupils; many of these also were the sons of\r\nofficers. The teachers and tutors are partly civilians and partly\r\nmilitary men, about an equal number of each. The four classes, Tertia,\r\nQuarta, Quinta, and Sexta, are subdivided into nine, so that the average\r\nnumber at a lesson would not be more than twenty-three.\r\n\r\n_Senior Cadet House._\r\n\r\nThe upper or central cadet school is in the older part of Berlin, in the\r\n_Neue Friedrichs Strasse_, where on the pediment surmounting the gateway\r\nthe inscription, MARTIS ET MINERVÆ ALUMNIS M.DCC. LXXVI, records the\r\nerection by Frederick the Great, ten years before his death, of the\r\nlarge and stately quadrangle which formed the original house. Here the\r\npupils are quartered, and in the great court within, they go through\r\ntheir exercises. There are several houses on both sides of the street\r\nattached to the service of the institution, and buildings are in course\r\nof erection to accommodate additional numbers.\r\n\r\nA large separate building contains the present class-rooms. In the first\r\nof these which we visited, thirty cadets were engaged in military\r\ndrawing; in another, twenty-four of the second class, the Secunda, were\r\nbusy at their Latin lesson.\r\n\r\nThe room was fitted up on what appears to be the usual plan, with a\r\nseries of parallel desks on the same level, ranged along the outer wall,\r\nand a sufficient space between them and the inner wall for the teacher\r\nto pass freely up and down. His desk was at one end in front of the\r\nboys. The lesson was in Quintus Curtius. The teacher (a civilian) made\r\nthem construe each a sentence, and asked questions in parsing, &c., &c.,\r\nmuch in the English manner. There was no taking places. This in German\r\nschools appears to be confined to quite the lower classes. There is a\r\nseparate lecture-room here again for lessons on Natural Philosophy and\r\nChemistry, with a small gallery of models, instruments, &c., attached to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA large hall is used on state occasions, and serves the purpose also of\r\nan examination-room; it is called the hall of the Field Marshals, and is\r\nadorned with portraits of the sovereigns of Prussia from the Great\r\nElector downwards, and of the field marshals both of the time of\r\nFrederick the Great and of more recent date, among whom is the Duke of\r\nWellington. Here also is kept Napoleon’s sword taken at “La Belle\r\nAlliance,” and presented by Marshal Blucher.\r\n\r\nPassing to the first floor of the great quadrangular building, we found\r\nourselves in one of the sitting-rooms of the cadets. Seven boys had a\r\ncouple of rooms, consisting of a common sitting-room, and a common\r\nbed-room. Five is the number for which this amount of accommodation was\r\nintended, and to five the number will be reduced when the new buildings\r\nare completed. In a second and larger pair of rooms we found twelve\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nHere also is the library, containing 10,000 volumes, and comfortable\r\napartments occupied by the various superintending officers.\r\n\r\nThe boys, their morning lessons completed, had been going through their\r\nmilitary exercises under the superintendence of their officers; but they\r\nwere now collected in their studying-rooms, and were seen forming at the\r\ndoors, each small party under the command of its senior, ready to march\r\ninto the large and handsome dinner-hall.\r\n\r\nInto this the whole body of young men presently moved by companies,\r\nproceeding to station themselves in front of the tables. The tables are\r\nranged in parallel lines on each side of the central passage, and\r\naccommodate each of them ten, four sitting at each side, and a senior at\r\neach end. The order was given by the officer on duty for “prayer” (_Nun\r\nbeten wir_,) and a short silent grace was followed by the immediate\r\noccupation of the seats, and the commencement of the meal. The\r\narrangements in general appeared to be excellent.\r\n\r\nThe number in the school during the past year had been 420. The four\r\ncompanies into which the whole body of the pupils is divided, each\r\ncontain a certain proportion from each of the three classes; the senior\r\nin each company being invested with the charge of the juniors; those who\r\nare in the Selecta taking rank as under officers. In every room (_Stube_\r\nor _Wohnzimmer_) there is one _Selectaner_, who is responsible. The\r\nordinary ages are 15, 16 in the Secunda; 16, 17 in the Prima, and as far\r\nas 19 in the Selecta. No one is, as a rule, allowed to pass more than\r\none year in a class; if in that time he can not qualify himself for\r\nadvancement, he is dismissed. The rule does not, however, appear to be\r\nstrictly enforced. The general preservation of discipline appears to be\r\na good deal intrusted, as in English public schools, to these senior\r\npupils of the age of eighteen or nineteen. There are Resident Tutors\r\n(_Erziehers_ or _Gouverneurs_) as at Potsdam, who see a good deal of the\r\npupils, especially in the evenings, when they go into the sitting-rooms,\r\nsit with them, help them in their work, play at chess with them, &c.,\r\n&c. But they do not sleep close at hand between the sets of rooms, as at\r\nPotsdam, but at some little distance off.\r\n\r\nThe official arrangements for the control of the discipline consist\r\nprincipally in the system of what are called _Censur_ Classes. This is a\r\npeculiar system which requires some explanation. There are five _Censur_\r\nClasses quite independent of the ordinary classes of the school. A boy\r\non entering the Cadet School is always placed in the third of these\r\nclasses; if he behaves ill, he falls to Class IV. and is under\r\nrestrictions. Class V. is reserved for serious cases of misconduct, and\r\nany one who incurs the penalty of descending to it, is subject to\r\ncontinual superintendence, and is confined to the walls. Class II. gives\r\nconsiderable, and Class I. still more ample privileges. The members of\r\nthis class (usually only quite the elder boys) are allowed great freedom\r\nin the way of going out into the town.\r\n\r\nIn each of the studying-rooms (the _Wohnzimmer_) the list of the\r\noccupants’ names hangs up on the door inside. One for example was\r\nnoticed containing twelve names. To each was attached his rank in the\r\n_Censur_ Classes, as well as his position in the ordinary classes. At\r\nthe head stood one _Selectaner_, who in this instance was in charge of\r\nthe room; then followed the _Primaners_; and the list was completed by\r\nnine of the _Secunda_. As at the time of our visit (just after the\r\nEaster holidays and the yearly examination) the whole Selecta of the\r\nyear had just quitted, the room was in the charge of the senior\r\n_Primaner_. The authority exercised by these senior boys appears to be\r\nvery considerable.\r\n\r\nThe competition for admission to the Selecta, and for the after\r\nselection for immediate promotion, was spoken of as very considerable.\r\n\r\nThe number who came to the Berlin Cadet House without previously going\r\nto one of the junior establishments was said to be only a small\r\nper-centage.\r\n\r\nThe boys both here and at Potsdam were of course all found dressed in a\r\nmilitary uniform.\r\n\r\nThe studies pursued in the Cadet Corps agree nearly with those of the\r\ncommon public schools, but of these there are three different kinds:--\r\n\r\n1. The ordinary first-class school, the _gymnasium_ of the Prussian\r\nStates, is, strictly speaking, a school which prepares for the\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\n2. The second-class schools have the name of _Real_ or _Practical\r\nSchools_; they deal with the actual application to business and work,\r\nnot with the theory of mathematics or of language, and they may be said\r\nto resemble in some degree the schools occasionally attached in English\r\ntowns to Mechanics’ Institutes, or in the United States, to the Public\r\nEnglish High School or the Higher Department of a Union School. Young\r\nmen who have passed successfully through a gymnasium may be admitted to\r\nthe army without passing the preliminary or _Portepée-fähnrich_\r\nexamination. Those who complete their time at a _Real_ School have not\r\nhitherto been allowed the same privilege.\r\n\r\n3. There is a third and intermediate class called a _Real_ or _Practical\r\nGymnasium_, and to this, according to the statements of the official\r\nbooks, the courses of the Cadet Schools have hitherto corresponded. It\r\nappears, however, that there is only one specimen of the _Real\r\nGymnasium_ now in existence, the Coëln School in the old town of Berlin.\r\nThe system here is said to be more practical than the _Gymnasium_, and\r\nless professional or mechanical than the _Real School_.\r\n\r\nIt is intended during the present year to assimilate the course of\r\ninstruction at the Cadet Schools more nearly to that followed at the\r\n_Gymnasium_ or University School; the studies of the senior Cadet School\r\nat Berlin will be raised to a higher standard, but Greek and Hebrew,\r\nwhich are taught in all gymnasiums, will not be introduced.\r\n\r\nThe two systems have corresponded as follows :--\r\n\r\n  Class in the Cadet Corps.

Theoretical\r\nArithmetic, in combination with Algebra, is commenced apparently in the\r\n_Tertia_.\r\n\r\nThe subjects taught in the _Secunda_, _Prima_, and _Selecta_, that is,\r\nthe course of the Upper School at Berlin, has hitherto been as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  _In the Secunda:_\r\n\r\n  Quintus Curtius, Cicero’s Orations, and Ovid’s Metamorphoses; in\r\nMathematics, the completion of Plane and commencement of Solid Geometry;\r\nQuadratic Equations; the Physical, Statistical, and Ethnographical\r\nGeography of Europe; Ancient History, and History of the Middle Ages,\r\ndown to the Thirty Years’ War; a first course of Natural Philosophy;\r\nFrench and German Composition continued; Theory and Practice of Military\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\n  _In the Prima:_\r\n\r\n  Livy and Virgil; in Algebra, Progressions, Logarithms, Exponential\r\nEquations; Trigonometry, Mathematical and pure Physical Geography in\r\ngeneral; Modern History; second course of Natural Philosophy, Heat,\r\nElectricity, Magnetism, Sound, Light; French, Exercise in Speaking, &c.;\r\nHistory of German Literature; Composition, extempore Exercises; Military\r\nDrawing continued.\r\n\r\n  _In the Selecta:_\r\n\r\n  Arms and Munitions, and Artillery; Fortification, Tactics, Military\r\nLiterature Practical Exercises, Military Drawing and Surveying;\r\nexercises in French and German; Mental Philosophy; Chemistry; and the\r\nDifferential and Integral Calculus for those who propose to enter the\r\nArtillery or the Engineers.\r\n\r\nThe Secunda have weekly--\r\n\r\n            6 hours of Latin.\r\n            3  “    of German.\r\n            4  “    of French.\r\n            5  “    of Mathematics.\r\n            2  “    of History.\r\n            2  “    of Geography.\r\n            2  “    of Natural Philosophy.\r\n            2  “    of Lessons in Drawing.\r\n            2  “    of Religious Instruction.\r\n            2  “    of French Conversation.\r\n           --\r\n  Total,   30 hours weekly.\r\n\r\nThe Prima--\r\n\r\n  The same amount in Latin, German, French, Mathematics, Natural\r\nPhilosophy, French, Conversation, and Drawing; in History 3, and in\r\nGeneral Geography 2, and Mathematical Geography 1; of Religious\r\nInstruction 1. 33 hours weekly.\r\n\r\nThe _Selecta_ have--\r\n\r\n          4  hours of Tactics.\r\n          2    “   of Military Literature.\r\n          1    “   of Military Law and Regulations.\r\n          5    “   of Artillery.\r\n          5    “   of Fortification.\r\n          2    “   of Plan Drawing.\r\n          2    “   of Mental Philosophy, or English.\r\n          2    “   of Chemistry.\r\n          2    “   of Mathematics.\r\n          2    “   of French.\r\n          2    “   of German.\r\n         --\r\n  Total, 29 hours weekly.\r\n\r\nThe lessons appear to be going on from 8 to 11 or 12 in the morning, and\r\nfrom 2 to 4 or 5 in the evening. The pupils have two hours’ drill twice\r\na week. They get up at half-past 5, have breakfast, and an hour’s\r\npreparation before lessons begin. There are similar hours of study in\r\nthe evening from 6 to 8; and some of the pupils also take private\r\nlessons from the teachers.[7] During these special hours of study\r\n(_Arbeitstunde_,) the chambers are visited by the officers and tutors,\r\nassistance is given and diligence enforced. From 8 to half-past 9 they\r\nstudy as they please; the tutors are a good deal with them in the rooms;\r\nat 10 all are in bed. Wednesday and Saturday are half holidays; on\r\nSunday they attend morning service in the garrison church, and after\r\nthat is over, are allowed to be more or less absent in the town, to be\r\nwith their parents, relations, and friends.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: Not from the Tutors, but from the non-resident\r\n    Professors and Teachers.]\r\n\r\nFor the 420 cadets of the Institution at Berlin, there appear to be\r\nabout twenty professors and teachers not residing in the school, the\r\nmajority of whom are civilians; and in addition to these, twenty tutors\r\nand superintendents resident in the buildings. Of these, sixteen are\r\nmilitary officers, half of whom are permanently attached to the corps,\r\nand half on duty from various regiments, and four are civilians. The\r\ncadets being divided into four companies, each containing so many of the\r\nSelecta, so many of the Prima, and so many of the Secunda, to each of\r\nthese companies are attached one captain, one first-lieutenant, and two\r\nsecond-lieutenants, all of whom, however, take some part in the\r\ninstruction; and one civilian (_Civil-Erzieher_) is added with the\r\nespecial duty of looking after and assisting the studies of the cadets\r\nof the company.\r\n\r\nThe holidays are one month in summer (in July and August,) ten days or a\r\nfortnight at Christmas, eight days at Easter, and four at Whitsuntide.\r\n\r\nThe rules for the entrance of cadets into the army are as\r\nfollows:--Those who complete their year in the Prima are considered\r\nto be sufficiently prepared for ordinary admission. They are sent\r\nin to an examination before the Supreme Examinations Board (the\r\n_Ober-Militair-Examinations-Commission_) before examiners entirely\r\nindependent of and unconnected with the instruction of the cadets; and\r\nthe majority, if they pass, are admitted simply as _Portepée-fähnriche_,\r\non the same conditions as the young men already spoken of who enter upon\r\nthe recommendation merely of the commanding officer of a regiment and\r\nthe approval of the commanding officer of an army corps. Like these,\r\nthey serve in the regiment, they attend the Division Schools, and in due\r\ntime offer themselves for examination for a commission.\r\n\r\nOut of this number, however, the sixty who do best are retained, and\r\nreserved to receive in the special military class of the Cadet School\r\nthe instruction which the others are to seek in the Division Schools.\r\nThese remain another year in the Cadet House, and undergo at its close,\r\nbefore leaving the Cadet House, their officers’ examination before the\r\nSupreme Board. The thirty best are once more selected, and receive\r\nimmediate promotion. Their patents are signed and they join their\r\nregiments at once as second-lieutenants. The other thirty, if they have\r\nsatisfied the examiners, receive a certificate of qualification, and\r\nenter with the rank of _Portepée-fähnrich_, and with, the prospect of\r\nreceiving commissions without further examination, as soon as vacancies\r\noccur. Any one who fails to pass his examination must enter, if at all,\r\nsimply with the rank of _Portepée-fähnrich_, and has to qualify himself\r\nin the Division Schools for attempting a second time the examination for\r\nthe officer’s patent.\r\n\r\nSuch is the system as recently modified. Till quite lately only thirty\r\nwere promoted from the Prima to the Selecta, and these thirty, unless\r\nthey failed wholly, obtained immediate commissions at the end of the\r\nyear. It has been found desirable to introduce the stimulus of\r\ncompetition, to offer a definite reward in the way of superior\r\nadvantages to the best students, and to make it obviously worth a young\r\nman’s while to exert himself, and to be thoroughly diligent during this\r\nfinal year in the Selecta at the Cadet School.\r\n\r\nYoung men who, after passing the examination in the Prima, desire to\r\nenter the artillery and engineers, follow the usual course leading to\r\nthe Artillery and Engineers’ School. They enter an artillery regiment,\r\nor a division of the engineers; they serve for nine months, they enter\r\nthe special school, they are eligible after the first quarter to the\r\ngrade of _Portepée-fähnrich_, and at the close of their first year are\r\nexamined for their lieutenant’s commission. Those who remain in the\r\nSelecta have the great advantage of passing from the Cadet School\r\nimmediately into the Artillery and Engineers’ School as lieutenants, and\r\ncommence their course there accordingly at the beginning of the second\r\nof the three years. As, however, the school-year closes at the end of\r\nApril, in the Cadet Houses, and begins in the Artillery and Engineers’\r\nSchool on the 1st of October, these select cadets also pass five months\r\nwith their regiment in actual service before recommencing their studies.\r\n\r\nThe average number who pass in this manner into the Artillery and\r\nEngineers’ School is stated by the authorities of the Cadet House to be\r\nthree annually from the Selecta, and six or eight from the Prima.\r\n\r\nIt can hardly have escaped observation, that the studies pursued as a\r\nqualification for entering the army are, with the exception of the\r\nSelecta, almost entirely non-professional, even here in this part of the\r\ngeneral system, which is in other respects most military in its\r\ncharacter; and the tendency seems to be to carry out to a still greater\r\nextent the theory of continuing to as late an age as possible a good\r\ngeneral education. There is evidently a general desire in Prussia, to\r\ntake the officers of the standing army exclusively from the\r\nwell-educated or the higher classes.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangements for the lessons, the very temperate or even timid\r\nuse of the stimulus of competition deserves to be noticed. It appears,\r\nhowever, to have been lately employed with advantage in the highest\r\nclass. At the same time, the provision made for giving really good\r\ninstruction, and for placing all the boys in close relation with their\r\nteachers, can not but excite admiration. The small numbers of which the\r\nclasses consist, and the care which seems to be taken in providing good\r\nteachers, both deserve attention.\r\n\r\nThe domestic arrangements, without being remarkable for the scrupulous\r\ncleanliness or the magnitude of the new institutions in Austria,\r\ncertainly in some respects are more in accordance with English feelings.\r\nThe greater privacy afforded by the use of rooms where few live\r\ntogether, is certainly more analogous to what has been found most\r\ndesirable for English boys in large English schools, though most likely\r\nthe contrary system is not less well-adapted to the national character\r\nin France and in Austria.\r\n\r\n\r\n_2. The Division Schools._\r\n\r\nThere are nine Division Schools for the whole army, one for each army\r\ncorps, and they are placed at the following towns:--\r\n\r\nPotsdam, Königsberg, Stettin, Frankfort on the Oder, Erfurt, Glogan,\r\nNeisse, Münster, and Trèves.\r\n\r\nHere the young aspirant finds himself with nine or ten companions and a\r\nbody of teachers amounting to about half that number, appointed by the\r\ncommanding officer of the army corps, and differing considerably in\r\ndifferent districts in their talents and ideas of education. They are\r\noften, though not always, selected from officers who have been at the\r\nStaff School, and afterwards at the Topographical Bureau. Their\r\nadditional pay for teaching is uncertain; it depends upon the surplus\r\nremaining after the expenses of the household, and the money paid in\r\npurchasing books, instruments, &c., is deducted from the yearly\r\nallowance made to the school by the government. At best it is not high.\r\nIt is calculated by the number of lectures, and at the most amounts to\r\nsomething more than 4_l._ 10_s._ (30 thalers) for the lectures on a\r\nsingle subject, given, it must be remembered, during the course of\r\nlittle more than six months in the year. The highest pay given in the\r\nPotsdam School to any one professor amounted to something more than 15\r\n_l._ (100 thalers) yearly for lectures on three subjects, averaging ten\r\nor twelve lectures weekly for about six months. This must be estimated\r\nby a Prussian, not an English standard, being nearly equivalent to\r\nfive-twelfths of the annual pay of a second lieutenant in that service.\r\nStill the sum is very low; and this, with some other obvious\r\ndeficiencies, injures the working of the schools.\r\n\r\nThe young candidate for a commission begins a course of Tactics,\r\nFortification, theory of Drawing and Surveying, Military Literature,\r\nArtillery, &c., Military Essays, and Drawing of Plans, which must be\r\nfinished at the school in nine months, although it may be continued\r\nlonger in private if the candidate is not prepared to pass his\r\nexamination. As long as it lasts, twenty-three hours a week are devoted\r\nto study, besides the time occupied by questions, which the teachers are\r\nrequired to set from time to time, in order to keep up the pupil’s\r\nprevious knowledge of French and Mathematics. The course is divided into\r\nthe purely theoretical and practical divisions, the first of six and a\r\nhalf months, the latter of two and a half. We have already given a very\r\nfull account of the studies in p. 188.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of studies is systematic, and the number of hours\r\ndevoted each week to lectures on the various subjects of study and to\r\ngymnastic riding and fencing, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  WEEKLY:\r\n                                        Hours.\r\n  Fortification,                          4\r\n  Artillery, &c.,                         3\r\n  Tactics,                                4\r\n  Military Surveying (theoretically,)     4\r\n  Military Literature,                    2\r\n  Instruction on Military Duties,         1\r\n  Plan Drawing,                           5\r\n  Gymnastics,                             2\r\n  Riding,                                 2\r\n  Fencing,                                2\r\n                                         --\r\n    Total,                               29\r\n\r\nThe subjoined plan gives the exact employment of time for each day\r\nduring the week :--\r\n\r\nPLAN OF LECTURES AT THE DIVISION SCHOOL IN POTSDAM, 1855-6.\r\n\r\n  -------+--------------------+----------------+-------------------+---\r\n  Hours. |  Monday.           |  Tuesday.      |  Wednesday.       |\r\n  -------+--------------------+----------------+-------------------+---\r\n   8- 9} |                    | Military       |                   | *\r\n   9-10} | Fortification.     |   Literature.  | Tactics.          |\r\n         |                    |                |                   |\r\n  10-11  | Instruction on     |}               | Plan drawing.     |\r\n         |   Military duties. |}               |                   |\r\n         |                    |}Artillery, &c. |                   |\r\n  11-12  |}Plan drawing.      |}               |                   |\r\n  12- 1  |}                   |                |                   |\r\n  12½-2½ |                    | Gymnastics.    |                   |\r\n  -------+--------------------+----------------+-------------------+\r\n         |  Thursday          |  Friday.       |  Saturday.        |\r\n  -------+--------------------+----------------+-------------------+-\r\n   8- 9 }|                    |                |                   |\r\n   9-10} | Fortification.     | Artillery      | Tactics.          |\r\n         |                    |                |                   |\r\n  10-11} | Military           |  Plan Drawing. | Military          |\r\n  11-12} |   Surveying        |                |   Surveying       |\r\n         |   (theoretically.) |                |   (theoretically.)|\r\n         |                    |                |                   |\r\n  12½-2½ | Riding.            | Fencing.       |                   |\r\n  -------+--------------------+----------------+-------------------+---\r\n\r\n  [* Dinner time, 3 o’clock. Time for studying, from 6 till 8 o’clock,\r\n  or from 7 till 9 o’clock every evening.]\r\n\r\nThe lecturer has to draw up what is called the thread of the lecture\r\n(_leitfaden_,) a sort of programme containing its leading heads,\r\nintended to assist the memory of the pupils in giving a full account of\r\nit afterwards; and the contents of the different lectures on Tactics,\r\nArms and Munitions, Fortifications, &c., are written out very minutely\r\nby the students. Ten pages of close print are devoted to these\r\nprogrammes in Helldorf; and the translation already given (pp. 188-194)\r\nwill show that the list of military subjects adverted to is\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the nine months spent at the Division School, the\r\n“_Officier Aspiranten_” go to Berlin for the examination for their\r\ncommission. If they can not pass this, they return to study by\r\nthemselves for their second trial. Unless by special permission from the\r\nKing, they can not try more than twice.\r\n\r\nThe examination is conducted by the Supreme Commission for Examinations\r\nat Berlin, and has been already described.\r\n\r\nThe Division Schools were founded at the end of the great War. Their\r\ngerm appears in Scharnhorst’s general order in 1810, which, among other\r\nthings, instituted three War Schools for the candidate for commissions\r\n(_Portepée-fähnriche_.) These three War Schools seem to have been\r\nchanged into the Division Schools in 1813 and 1816. At first, indeed,\r\nthey were much more numerous than at present, as their name implies,\r\nthere being two Divisions to each Army-Corps. There are now, as we have\r\nmentioned, nine; and Corps School or Army-Corps School would be the more\r\ncorrect designation.\r\n\r\nTheir importance as the institutions for special military instruction to\r\nall “_Officier-Aspiranten_” of the army led us to inquire carefully with\r\nregard to their efficiency, and in particular from two distinguished\r\nofficers, on whose judgment and scientific experience great reliance\r\nmight be placed. One of these, it may be added, possessed constant means\r\nof knowing all the details respecting them.\r\n\r\nI. Formerly, it appears, it was not possible to limit these schools to\r\ntheir true object, purely military instruction. This was the special\r\nobject of their creation; but owing to the defective _general_ education\r\nwhich candidates often brought with them into the army, the Division\r\nSchools were too much used as a means of meeting this deficiency.\r\n\r\nII. The opinions we obtained were certainly not favorable with regard to\r\nthe present efficiency of these schools. It seemed to be agreed, that\r\nfrom various reasons, the military education given was susceptible of\r\nmuch improvement; that some of the Division Schools were really\r\ndefective in teaching, whilst none could be pointed to as strikingly\r\ngood. But it was also admitted that these blemishes arose from\r\nremediable defects in the working of the schools; that their principle\r\nwas in itself sound, and capable of being carried out more perfectly,\r\nand excellently adapted to the object of giving some military\r\ninstruction to all desirous of becoming officers of the infantry and\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\nIII. The causes assigned for the present defects in the efficiency of\r\nthe Division Schools were chiefly the following:--\r\n\r\n(_a._) That they were far too numerous.\r\n\r\nEducated and scientific as Prussia may be called, it is not found\r\npracticable to supply _nine_ army schools with exactly the sort of men\r\nfitted for the work of education. The pay, it must be added, is\r\ninsufficient to attract many, and thus (as we were informed,) although\r\nmany officers of intelligence are sometimes not unwilling to leave the\r\nlife of drill for the life of education for a year or two, few do so\r\nwith the serious purpose of doing it _well_. Neither the position nor\r\nthe emoluments tempt them to make it a profession. Officers in command\r\nof the district have made the appointments, and often have\r\n“good-naturedly,” as it was said, appointed unfit persons, known as\r\nstudious men.\r\n\r\n(_b._) The small number of pupils in each school was also spoken of as a\r\nvery great disadvantage, as doing away with all emulation amongst\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n(_c._) The independence which each school has enjoyed, and the want of\r\nany central body to watch its working and regulate its system, is also\r\nsaid to have had bad results. The teaching has been far from\r\nuniform,--in one school energetic, in another lax; in one school the\r\nmost important subjects taught, in another, a little of everything; in a\r\nthird, some special crotchet of a teacher. This has acted badly on the\r\nexaminations, since it was thought hard to reject an “_aspirant_” who\r\nhad done parts of his work well, and had been evidently ill taught or\r\nsuperficially instructed in others.\r\n\r\nThe remedies suggested were,--\r\n\r\n(1.) Considerably to diminish the number of these schools. This, we were\r\ntold, was about to be done by reducing them from _nine_ to _three_. Such\r\na course would obviously tend to remedy two of the evils complained of.\r\nIt would give a larger choice of teachers, and afford more liberal means\r\nof remunerating them, and a larger attendance and competition of pupils.\r\n\r\n(2.) To place the schools under the more direct regulation and\r\nmanagement of the Central Educational Department at Berlin. This step\r\nwould improve their teaching by subjecting it to constant inspection and\r\nreports. It would insure uniformity in the system of instruction and\r\nsubjects of study; and, when combined with the presence of able\r\nteachers, it would enable the Board of Examiners at Berlin to pursue a\r\nmore strict and unvarying course in rejecting ill-qualified candidates.\r\nBy these means the teaching in the school would probably become more\r\ndefinite and higher.\r\n\r\nOne other point was mentioned to us as doubtful. It was thought that the\r\ntime for attending the Division School came too soon after a young man’s\r\nentrance into the army, when he had but recently obtained his liberty,\r\nand was likely to be much more unwilling to be sent to school again than\r\nmight have been the case a year or two later. General von Willisen, who\r\nurged this objection to us, was consequently for deferring the\r\nattendance at the Division Schools several years in an officer’s life.\r\n\r\nWe should add, however, that as in Prussia a young _Officier-aspirant_\r\nis still partly a private soldier, we were told that many were glad to\r\nexchange the severity of regimental discipline for the Division School.\r\n\r\n\r\n_3. The United Artillery and Engineers’ School at Berlin._\r\n\r\nYoung men desirous of obtaining commissions in the Artillery or\r\nEngineers follow the course which has already been described. They join\r\neither with a nomination from a colonel of artillery or engineers, or as\r\nscholars from the Cadet House. They submit themselves for examination\r\nfor the grade of Ensign (_Portepée-fähnrich_); they serve their time\r\nwith the troops, they go through a course of professional study, and are\r\nexamined in it for their officer’s commission by the Board at Berlin. If\r\nthey come from the highest class, the _Selecta_ of the Cadet House, they\r\nhave the privilege of joining the corps with the rank of officer.\r\n\r\nIn these respects the system is the same for them as for the\r\n_Aspiranten_ in the other arms of the service.\r\n\r\nThe distinctions are, that first, in the preliminary or Ensign’s\r\nExamination, a somewhat greater acquaintance with mathematics is\r\nrequired from them; secondly, that they prepare for the Officer’s\r\nExamination, and follow their professional studies, not in the Division\r\nSchools, but in a separate Special Arm School at Berlin. Moreover, nine\r\nmonths’ service with the troops, instead of six, is required before they\r\ncan enter the Special Arm School. They enter it also with the rank only\r\nof corporal, and are not eligible to the grade of Swordknot Ensign until\r\nthey have passed three months at least in the school.\r\n\r\nTheir Officer’s Examination before the Supreme Board at Berlin takes\r\nplace after nine months more, at the end of the first year at the\r\nschool, and after passing they are eligible to the rank of officer.\r\n\r\nWhen a vacancy occurs their claim to an actual commission is considered,\r\nand the usual formalities are fulfilled. Their names are submitted for\r\napproval to the officers of the corps, and with that approbation laid\r\nbefore the King; and they thus in due time obtain their rank as\r\nSub-Lieutenants respectively of Artillery or of Engineers.\r\n\r\nThis rank, however, is provisional, and their position is that of\r\nsupernumeraries. Their education as officers may be complete, but their\r\neducation as officers of Artillery or of Engineers has scarcely in fact\r\ncommenced. They have before them a third examination, that of the\r\nSpecial Arm, their _Vocation-trial_ or _Berufs-prüfung_. Or, more\r\ncorrectly speaking, they have not one but two to pass, for the third\r\nexamination is divided into two stages, one to be passed at the end of\r\neach of the two years which yet remain of the course. It is only when\r\nthese are completed, after a three years’ stay, that the young man is\r\nfinally allowed to join his corps as a second-lieutenant.\r\n\r\nFailure in the officers’ examination at the close of the first year is\r\nattended with the penalty of returning to the corps and resuming service\r\nin the ranks with the troops. Whether or not the rejected student may be\r\npermitted to return after an interval to join again the classes of the\r\nfirst year, or after passing, upon a second trial, the officers’\r\nexamination, to enter the classes of the second year, will depend upon\r\nthe extent of his failure.\r\n\r\nFailure in the examination at the close of the second year is similarly\r\nvisited with the punishment of return to the corps. As they have already\r\npassed the officers’ examination, they may endeavor to effect a transfer\r\nto a regiment of the line; or, under certain circumstances, they may be\r\npermitted to study privately in preparation for the third year’s course,\r\nand may offer themselves for a second trial.\r\n\r\nIf a student fails in his last examination at the close of the third\r\nyear, he may be allowed, in like manner, under favorable circumstances,\r\nto re-enter the third year’s classes, and try to qualify himself by an\r\nadditional year of study, losing, of course, his seniority. Otherwise,\r\nhe joins the corps as a supernumerary, with the pay of an infantry\r\nofficer, and waits till he can obtain a commission in the line.\r\n\r\nCandidates for commissions in the engineers enter the corps, it should\r\nbe observed, originally as volunteers, finding their own clothing, and\r\nreceiving no pay; but as soon as they enter the school they are\r\nregularly paid by the state, and receive their pay in the usual course\r\nof the service from the division to which they belong.\r\n\r\nThe studies of the three years are arranged in accordance with the\r\nsystem that has just been described. Those of the first year are common\r\nto the two arms, and correspond, in a general way, with what is taught\r\nin the Division Schools or in the highest class of the Cadet House.\r\nThose of the second year are devoted to the special arm subjects. In\r\nMathematics, Artillery, and Fortification, the lectures are common to\r\nthe artillery and engineers; in drawing they are divided.\r\n\r\nIn the third year a considerable separation takes place. Mathematics are\r\nstill taught, and there is a special class of the most advanced students\r\nin the Differential and Integral Calculus, the Higher Geometry, and in\r\nAnalytical Mechanics and Hydraulics; this, however, is purposely\r\nrestricted to about one-third of the class, by raising the requirements,\r\nif necessary.\r\n\r\nThe course is divided in each year into the theoretical and the\r\npractical part. The year commences in October with the former, and the\r\nstudies for the nine months succeeding are for the most part theoretical\r\nonly. In June the examinations take place. July, August, and a part of\r\nSeptember are given up to practical exercises. Something like the last\r\nthree weeks of September are allowed for a vacation.\r\n\r\nThe general control of the school is in the hands of the General\r\nInspectors of the two services, the artillery and the engineers. These\r\ntwo are the _Curators_ of the school and form the _Curatorium_. They\r\nmake their reports to the General Inspector of Military Education, of\r\nwhom mention has already been made. The immediate management is\r\nintrusted to a director, who is a field officer of artillery or\r\nengineers, of the rank of commandant of a regiment, and he has a\r\ncaptain, appointed by the _Curatorium_ as his assistant.\r\n\r\nThere is a Board of Studies, of which the Director is chairman,\r\nconsisting of the Senior Professor of Mathematics, of the Instructors of\r\nArtillery and Engineering in the third Cœtus, and of an equal number of\r\nofficers of the two services named by the Curators.\r\n\r\nFour officers, three from the artillery and one from the engineers,\r\nacting under the captain, are charged with the care of discipline and\r\norder; these are the _Direction_ Officers.\r\n\r\nThere are twelve military and eleven civilian professors and teachers.\r\nAmong the military professors and teachers may be included any of the\r\ndirection officers.\r\n\r\nThe examinations of the first year are conducted by the usual Board, the\r\nSupreme Military Examinations Board; but for those of the second and of\r\nthe third year, there is a separate board, chosen from the two services\r\nby the Curators, and otherwise unconnected with the School.\r\n\r\nThe numbers in the school vary from 216 to 240. In time of peace about\r\nfive are yearly admitted for each regiment of artillery, and two or\r\nthree for each division of engineers. The great majority have entered\r\nthe army from the usual places of civil education, a few from the Prima\r\nof the Cadet House, on the same terms as the others, and a small number,\r\nwho are usually among the best pupils in the school, from the Selecta,\r\nwho come as officers, and after a short service with the troops, enter\r\nthe second year’s classes, provided there is room, preference being\r\nalways allowed to the students already belonging to the school, who have\r\nsucceeded in passing the examination of the first year.\r\n\r\nThe Artillery and Engineers’ School buildings stand in Berlin itself, in\r\nthe principal street, _Unter den Linden_, No. 74, near the Brandenburg\r\nGate. They bear the following inscription: _Artillerie und Ingenieur\r\nSchule. Stiftung Friedrich Wilhelms_ III. M.DCCC.XXII.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of our visit to the school, we were allowed by the\r\nkindness of the authorities to be present at some of the lectures. The\r\nstudents of the second year were attending the course on the History of\r\nthe Art of War, and the immediate subject was an account of and\r\ncriticism on the battle of Blenheim. The young men, about forty-five in\r\nnumber, were ranged in desks facing the Professor, but not in the manner\r\nof an amphitheater. The lecture was interesting, animated, and generally\r\ninstructive; it was perfectly professorial in character, and the young\r\nmen took notes. A class of the students of the first year, thirty-five\r\nin number, were engaged in topographical drawing. The artillery division\r\nof the third year students were in another room, listening to and busily\r\ntaking notes upon a lecture (also professorial) on the construction of\r\ngun-carriages: the number was about forty-five.\r\n\r\nOnly the students of the first year are lodged in the building; and\r\nowing to the unusually large number lately admitted, an adjoining house\r\nhas been taken to afford additional room. The accommodation in general\r\nis rather limited. Two stories in the upper part of the building are\r\noccupied by the somewhat scantily furnished chambers; there appeared in\r\nsome cases to be two young men in one room, in other cases four, or as\r\nmany as six or seven to a bedroom and sitting-room. The students who\r\nlodge in the building dine together in a mess-room; and there is a\r\nbilliard-room, with coffee-rooms adjoining it, for the general use,\r\nlooking out from the ground floor front into the Unter den Linden. There\r\nis a library, a small laboratory attached to the lecture-room employed\r\nfor the subjects of Chemistry and Natural Philosophy, and a small\r\ncollection of apparatus required for illustration on the latter subject.\r\n\r\nOn quitting the school, the engineer students, as soon as they obtain\r\ntheir commissions, are employed for three years with a Division of\r\nEngineers; then for three years in a fortress to superintend buildings;\r\nand then again with a Division of Engineers. They are then eligible to\r\npromotion as first-lieutenants.\r\n\r\nThe artillery students, in like manner, join and serve with their\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nPromotion in the artillery is by regiments, in the engineers it is\r\ngeneral throughout the whole corps.\r\n\r\nWe should not omit to call attention to the fact, that the only instance\r\nwhich has come to our knowledge of the promotion of _officers in their\r\nown arm of the service_, being made contingent on their passing an\r\nexamination, is to be found in the Prussian Artillery and Engineers.\r\nFirst-Lieutenants belonging to those corps must pass an examination\r\nbefore they can be promoted to the rank of captain. This regulation does\r\nnot exist for any other part of the Prussian service, and it is\r\nconsidered a great grievance by the officers of those corps, as it may\r\nbe exacted at the age of forty, from the most highly educated officers\r\nof the Prussian army.\r\n\r\nThe pay of subaltern of engineers is somewhat higher than that of the\r\nartillery, infantry, and cavalry. Above the rank of subaltern, the pay\r\nof the artillery, cavalry, and engineers, is on an equality, but\r\nsuperior to that of the infantry. The engineers have, moreover, a\r\nprospect of employment of a civil nature when they return from active\r\nservice; to lucrative positions of this kind they are not unfrequently\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned before quitting the subject, that all the\r\nofficers of the artillery and engineers are bound, in consideration of\r\nthree years’ maintenance in the school, to serve a period of six years,\r\nbefore they can exercise the usual privilege allowed to Prussian\r\nofficers of withdrawing from the service.\r\n\r\n[_A particular account of the Course of Instruction in this School will\r\nbe given in a separate article under the title of the Institution._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. SCHOOL FOR STAFF OFFICERS AT BERLIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe War School (_Kriegs-Schule_) in Berlin has undergone many changes\r\nsince its foundation in the time of Frederick the Great. It is now the\r\nStaff School of Prussia, _i.e._, the only, or almost the only, means of\r\nobtaining a staff appointment is by passing through it, and the\r\neducation given is particularly intended to form staff officers. Its\r\nplan and methods of teaching differ, indeed, from the very commencement\r\nfrom the French Staff School, and bear much more resemblance to the\r\nsenior department at Sandhurst, with the exception that the senior\r\ndepartment is not at present a necessary means towards a staff\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nThus the _Kriegs-Schule_ does not take young men of twenty-one or\r\ntwenty-two and educate them (like the French Staff School) for the staff\r\nand the staff alone. Its pupils are men of twenty-five or twenty-six,\r\nofficers of three years’ standing, or five years’ service since their\r\nfirst entering the army. At this comparatively ripe age they become\r\ncandidates for entrance to the Staff School, and, if admitted, they\r\nspend there three years of laborious study, with no very brilliant\r\nprospects to crown it, as only a very small number obtain what may be\r\ncalled the lowest prize, admission to the Topographical Department; and\r\nout of these only two or three yearly of the most distinguished pupils\r\ngain the Staff. The rest return to their regiments, and are employed as\r\nadjutants or as teachers in the Division Schools.\r\n\r\nThe process of entrance is as follows:--An officer of three years’\r\nstanding desires to go to the Staff School. Any one may send in his name\r\nas a candidate for the entrance examination to the minister of war,\r\nhaving obtained a certificate from his superior officer that he\r\nunderstands his regular duty, has no debts, and is capable, both as\r\nregards his abilities and bodily strength, of making a good staff\r\nofficer. Little difficulty is made about admission to become a\r\ncandidate, nor is there any regulation to limit the number from any one\r\ncorps or regiment, so that there may be often found in the Staff School\r\nmore in proportion from the infantry than the cavalry, and _vice versâ_.\r\nSome regiments, we heard, hardly ever send officers to the school.\r\nPractically, indeed, the regulation requiring three years of active\r\nservice bears hard upon the artillery and engineers in comparison with\r\nthe other services; for, as the officers of these two corps only enter\r\ntheir own school after they have been near a year in the service, and\r\nspend three years there, they must have been in the army nearly seven\r\nyears before they can enter the Staff School.\r\n\r\nThe candidate for the Staff School is examined in the capital of the\r\nprovince in which his corps is stationed. The examination is early in\r\nApril, and it is held at the provincial town instead of Berlin, in order\r\nto diminish expense. But the questions are sent from the board of\r\nexaminers in Berlin, and the same are given in the different provincial\r\ntowns at one and the same time. The examination is much on the same\r\nsubjects, and requires about the same actual knowledge as that which was\r\npassed at least three years before for a lieutenancy, but owing to the\r\ndifference of age, the questions are put and are expected to be answered\r\nin a much more scientific form than on the first occasion. Thus, we were\r\ntold, such an essay as “Give an account of the wars of Francis I. and\r\nCharles V.,” would at the _Kriegs-Schule_ Examination rather be stated\r\nthus: “What was the influence of these wars on the policy and religion\r\nof Europe?”\r\n\r\nThe examination is entirely upon paper; it occupies from ten to twelve\r\ndays of about five hours daily, the superintending staff officer in the\r\nprovince presiding over it. But his business is limited to reading out\r\nthe questions sent to him, and taking care that no books are brought in,\r\nor any improper means used. The answers to the questions have to go\r\nthrough a double ordeal, the military ones being first examined by some\r\nof the staff of the general commanding in the province, and afterwards\r\nby the commission of examiners at Berlin. The final decision rests with\r\nthe chief of the Prussian staff, who recommends the successful officers\r\nto the minister of war.\r\n\r\nThere is an average of sixty or seventy candidates yearly. Only forty of\r\nthese can be taken. If some additional case seems meritorious, the\r\nofficer may obtain a promise of appointment, but his entrance is\r\ndeferred. It is not uncommon to try more than once.\r\n\r\nThe entrance examination passed, the school opens on the 1st of October,\r\nto continue its lectures, with a fortnight’s break at Christmas and at\r\nEaster, till the first of June. It has its 120 pupils, divided into\r\ntheir three classes, one for each year, working (with only little of\r\npractical work) under professors, military for the lectures of a\r\nmilitary, and civil for those of a non-military character. No\r\ndifficulty, we understood, is found here, as we had heard to be the case\r\nat St. Cyr, in enforcing the fullest attention to the lectures of the\r\ncivilian professors; each is respected according to his knowledge of the\r\nsubject, and it would be thought as absurd for a military professor to\r\nundertake a non-professional subject, as _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nThe method of working is that so commonly followed in the Prussian\r\nuniversities of listening to numerous lectures, and taking copious notes\r\nupon them. Nearly five hours daily, from eight in the morning till one,\r\nare often continuously occupied in this manner; for although only twenty\r\nhours of attendance are absolutely exacted weekly (an amount which to\r\nour own students would seem more than ample) ten more are said to be\r\nnecessary to enable an officer to do any justice to the various subjects\r\nof which he is expected to show some knowledge at his examinations.\r\n\r\nThese lectures are usually read aloud; there is no questioning and\r\nanswering. The student, after five morning hours, must spend at least\r\nfive or six more in copying them out, or in writing an essay on the\r\nsubject of some of the lectures. Of these one is given about every three\r\nweeks, but only on military subjects. They are carefully corrected and\r\nsent back to the student with the notes of his teacher, and their merit\r\ninfluences the final estimate of his whole work.\r\n\r\nBesides this daily work, the examinations are at once a stimulus and a\r\nmeans of testing proficiency. These occur every three months, but the\r\nyearly ones are the most important. They are entirely upon paper. In the\r\nquarterly ones the papers are only given for two hours at a time daily,\r\nand take the place of two common lectures; in the other examinations\r\nthey are daily for four or five hours. They are entirely essays upon the\r\nnumerous subjects lectured on in the school, History of War, Philosophy,\r\nTactics, &c.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there is no better way of giving an idea of the mode of studying\r\nthan by a statement of some of the subjects of these essays. They have\r\nbeen supplied to us by the kindness of Lieutenant Berger, of the 28th\r\nInfantry, from whom we have received much valuable information on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n    _General Essays._\r\n\r\n  On Tactics:--I.

(Two hours.)\r\n\r\nThe knowledge required is seen in the account of the Staff School,\r\n(p. 395) and in the list of the Lectures given above. Besides military\r\nsubjects, it includes a very full course of Ancient and Modern History,\r\nan addition to the History of War (which last alone occupies seven hours\r\nweekly for the last year,) a good deal of Logic and Philosophy of Art\r\nand Literature, and of Political Economy. Some of these lectures have\r\nprobably been introduced from the school, having a double object, that\r\nof giving a diplomatic as well as a military education. This was the\r\noriginal idea of Frederick the Great, who, in all his plans of military\r\nteaching, laid a great stress on the general literature which he himself\r\nvalued so highly. This diffusive study is a strong contrast to the\r\nprinciple of “little, but well,” and to the constant practical exercises\r\nin the laboratories insisted on by the early teachers of the Polytechnic\r\nSchool in France.\r\n\r\nThe following is the plan of the lectures for the three years.

We invite a comparison with the\r\n    French plan, which we have given elsewhere, but the difference of\r\n    age must be taken into account. The mathematical course at this\r\n    school is,--\r\n\r\n    1st year. Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, Quadratic Equations,\r\n    involving several unknown quantities, the Binomial Theorem, and\r\n    the Elements of Analytical and Solid Geometry.\r\n\r\n    2d year. Analytical Geometry and the Differential and Integral\r\n    Calculus.\r\n\r\n    3d year. Mechanics, Statics, Dynamics, Projectiles, and slight\r\n    Applications.\r\n\r\n    Only the first year is obligatory.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the above course is entirely theoretical; no\r\npractical work (as in France) relieves the sedentary labor of ten hours\r\ndaily for more than eight months of the year. But as soon as the first\r\nyear’s course is ended, all the officers who are supposed to know\r\ndrawing before coming to the school, are sent into the country for three\r\nweeks to practice military drawing and surveying; and those of the third\r\nyear go through (also for the same period) a similar course of staff\r\nduty. These last are sent under the direction of the officer who is\r\nProfessor of Staff Duty at the School; each student officer gets his\r\nseparate orders, and they meet and are told off every morning for their\r\nday’s work, reconnoitering fortresses, surveying the frontiers between\r\nAustria and Prussia, &c., &c. During the remaining three summer months\r\nthe students are sent in successive classes to those arms of the service\r\nwhich are not their own, and after the usual military exercises are\r\ncompleted they must bring back with them a certificate of proficiency\r\nfrom the commanding officer. This amount of time was spoken of as being\r\ntoo little.\r\n\r\nIf we are surprised at not finding a greater amount of practical work\r\nincluded amongst the labors of the school, we must remember that it is\r\nchiefly postponed to a later period of the officer’s career, when the\r\nprobability of his being required to use it on the staff is greater.\r\nThis is when he has gained his place in the Topographical Department,\r\nand is working there upon trial to test his fitness for the actual\r\nstaff. He is then employed during winter in working on the Theory of\r\nWar, and during summer in military surveying and drawing.\r\n\r\nSuch is the method and extent of the officer’s work at the Staff School;\r\na few more words are needed on the character of his examinations, which\r\nhere as everywhere else must greatly influence the character of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThere are no less than nine examinations during the three years, one for\r\nevery three months, but the final one at the end of each year is the\r\nmore important, as a sort of summing up of the year’s work. In marking\r\nfor this the merit of the essays done at home is taken into account. The\r\nresult in each branch of work and on every examination is entered by the\r\nseveral professors in a book kept at the directory, and the pupils have\r\na right to inspect the report of their own work. The net result of his\r\nown three years’ work is also sent to the officer after leaving the\r\nschool through the authorities of his regiment. The certificate of this\r\ncontains the criticism on each branch of his work in detail.\r\n\r\nThe subjects given for essays will show the nature of the chief\r\nexaminations (_i.e._ those at the end of each year;) four or five hours\r\nis the time generally allowed to a difficult subject, the examination\r\nstretching over a number of days, in proportion to the subjects taken\r\nup. The pupil may bring in his notes of lectures, on which extraordinary\r\ncare is bestowed, and which must contain everything that can be said on\r\nthe subject. Much value is said to be attached to the rapidity with\r\nwhich an essay is worked, as showing a quality valuable in an officer.\r\nThere is, as we have observed, no _vivâ voce_ of any kind in this\r\nSchool. Some competition exists in the Staff School, (and it is almost\r\nthe only Prussian school where we find it,) for the knowledge that only\r\neight or ten out of the forty pupils can obtain the Topographical\r\nDepartment, and only two out of these eight or ten, the staff, acts as a\r\ncompetitive stimulus. We must add, however, that although a minute\r\naccount of the _positive_ merits of the pupils is drawn up and sent to\r\nthem at the end of their career, they have no means of ascertaining\r\ntheir _relative_ positions; and this may always leave room for doubt,\r\nwhether the places in the Typographical Department and on the Staff are\r\nstrictly given by merit, or whether patronage does not here step in.\r\nAnother ambiguity may be remarked in the fact that the relative\r\nimportance of the subjects of study is not known. It may of course be\r\nsurmised, that a knowledge of the Peloponnesian War is not marked so\r\nhighly as that of the Seven Years’ War; but any indefiniteness as to\r\nwhat is or what is not important, will generally lead to an attempt to\r\nknow something _of all_ the subjects mentioned, and it would undoubtedly\r\nbe better to affix its definite value to every subject. It would prevent\r\nwhat seem to us valid objections to the present system of the Staff\r\nSchool, the attempt to crowd in too many subjects, instead of mastering\r\nthoroughly a few.\r\n\r\nThe final examination having been completed in June, the student goes\r\nthrough the three weeks of staff duty we have described, and finishes\r\nhis last three summer months in that branch of the army in which he has\r\nnot yet served. He then returns to his regiment, where he receives the\r\ncertificate of his three years’ work. But no list is published of the\r\norder of merit in which the officers stand. If the certificate is\r\nsatisfactory, he forwards it to the Chief of the Prussian Staff, with a\r\nrequest to be employed in the Topographical Department of the Staff. If\r\nthis is granted, he receives an order to join it in about two years,\r\n_i.e._ about nine or ten years after first entering the service.\r\n\r\nAbout eight officers are yearly sent to the Topographical Department,\r\nand serve there for two or three years, surveying and drawing in summer,\r\nworking at military science in the winter. The correction of the\r\nTopographical Map of Prussia is in their hands. Finally, two out of\r\nthese are selected for the Staff; the remainder return to their\r\nregiments, to become adjutants or to teach in the Division Schools.\r\n\r\nThe most immediate advantage of being in the staff corps is promotion to\r\na captaincy at any age, which, considering the extreme slowness of\r\npromotion in Prussia, may be termed an early one. This is generally\r\ngained within two or three years after joining the corps, _i.e._ at\r\nthirty-three or thirty-four. In other corps hardly any one has a chance\r\nof becoming captain till after forty.\r\n\r\nWe may add, that the number of officers in the Topographical Department\r\nis about forty, on the staff itself sixty-four. No one belonging to the\r\nstaff is below the rank of captain, or above that of colonel. Every\r\ngeneral of division has one officer of the staff attached to him, and\r\ntwo adjutants, the first nominated by the chief of the staff, the two\r\nlast by the king, and these two belong rather to the officer than to the\r\ngeneral. They are not removable with him. The adjutants are not officers\r\nof the staff, though they are often chosen from amongst those who have\r\nbeen at the Staff School. They are nominated by the king upon reports\r\nsent into him by the generals of division, and the appointment is not\r\nconsidered a great prize, as it implies neither extra pay, promotion,\r\nnor permanency; the adjutants are promoted in the usual course, and\r\nthen, upon promotion, return to their regiments. The adjutants of\r\nbattalions and regiments are appointed, like our own, by the officers\r\ncommanding. The name of aide-de-camp does not exist in the Prussian\r\nservice, but that of adjutant is used in its place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. ELEMENTARY MILITARY SCHOOLS FOR NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. MILITARY ORPHAN-HOUSES.\r\n\r\nThere are three Military Orphan-Houses in Prussia for the children of\r\nsoldiers, two for boys, one at Potsdam, and the other at Annaburg, and\r\none for girls at Pretzch. Although intended for orphans, they receive\r\nchildren whose parents are too poor to provide for them. They receive a\r\ngood elementary education and are brought up for trades, and can make\r\ntheir selection between a civil and a military career. The English\r\nCommissioners report that they found 800 pupils in the Orphan-House at\r\nPotsdam, of whom 200 were under the charge of female teachers; 520 were\r\nin the senior department, including thirty-six in the music class, who\r\nwill go into the Regimental Bands, and about twenty who formed a\r\nseparate military class, who would probably enter the Artillery School.\r\n\r\nThe School at Annaburg, and the subsidiary Girls’ School at Pretzsch,\r\nare both Protestant in character; no religious teaching is supplied for\r\nRoman Catholics. Roman Catholic boys are all sent to Potsdam, and Roman\r\nCatholic girls are provided for in ordinary schools, and in private\r\nfamilies, and payment made on their behalf out of the funds of the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nDr. Bache in his “_Report on Education in Europe_,” gives the following\r\naccount of these institutions.\r\n\r\n_Military Orphan-House at Potsdam._\r\n\r\n  This institution was founded in 1724, by Frederick William the First\r\nof Prussia. The reputation of Franke’s Foundations induced this monarch\r\nto rival the benevolence of the clergyman, and to establish on a scale\r\nproportioned to his greater means, a house for the education of the\r\norphans of his soldiers. While, however, the recipients of Franke’s\r\nbounty are free to choose their career in after life, and only so far\r\nbound to the institution, as a sense of gratitude may prompt, the youth\r\nwho passes through the Military Orphan-house of Potsdam, must enter the\r\nmilitary service for twelve years. Three of these, indeed, are the term\r\nof service of every citizen, and I believe the three years in the\r\nnon-commissioned officers’ school are now counted as part of the twelve,\r\nand thus the actual number of extra years of service is reduced to six.\r\nThe institution began with one hundred and seventy-nine children, both\r\ngirls and boys being received; this arrangement continued until a few\r\nyears since, when the girls’ school was removed from Potsdam, and the\r\nestablishment at present is for male pupils only. There are between\r\nthree and four hundred in the elementary or boys’ department. In the\r\nearly history of the orphan-house two attempts are recorded to introduce\r\nmanual labor, as a profitable speculation; neither of which appears,\r\nhowever, to have succeeded. The first of these, the manufacture of\r\nBrabant lace, was introduced in 1743, and after various modifications of\r\nthe mode of applying the labor of the children, it was finally abandoned\r\nin 1795. In 1744, the culture of silk was introduced extensively\r\nthroughout the kingdom, and especially enjoined at the orphan-houses;\r\nbut this attempt was not more successful in the end than the other, and\r\nthe culture is not kept up in this institution.\r\n\r\n  The present spacious buildings were chiefly constructed under the\r\nreign of the founder and of Frederick the Great. Additions have,\r\nhowever, been made from time to time since, and the whole plan is hardly\r\nyet completed. The institution may be considered as divided into three\r\ndepartments or schools; an elementary school, (called the Boys’ House,\r\n_das Knabenhaus_,) a trade school, and a music school. The buildings for\r\nthe elementary school are erected about a spacious court, which serves\r\nas an exercising and play-ground. On the ground floor are the refectory,\r\nin which all the youth from the different schools composing the\r\ninstitution, meet three times a day, and the study and play-rooms,\r\nlavatory, &c. The study-rooms form a long range, and when the doors of\r\ncommunication are opened, one teacher can superintend the whole of the\r\nclasses. The school-rooms are on the first and second floors, and are\r\ncalculated for divisions of forty boys each. There are six dormitories,\r\nfurnished with wooden or iron bedsteads, the latter having been more\r\nrecently introduced and found to answer well. The bedding consists of a\r\nstraw bed beneath, and a mattress of hair above. Each dormitory is\r\nsuperintended by a teacher, who sleeps at one end of it. There are also\r\ndwelling-rooms for the teachers, officers, &c., and in the court a very\r\nlarge wash-house, with a drying-room above it.\r\n\r\n  The buildings occupied by the trade and music schools are separated by\r\na street from the others, and with the dwellings of the officers, a room\r\nfor gymnastic exercises, and musical practice, and the workshops, form a\r\nsecond immense series of structures. The infirmary is near to them, and\r\nis under a separate direction; subordinate, however, to the general\r\nexecutive body. It is divided into rooms assigned to patients suffering\r\nfrom different complaints. A schoolmaster gives instruction to the\r\nconvalescent. The arrangements in the dormitories of the trades’ school,\r\nare similar to those used in the army, and the Superintendence and\r\ndiscipline are strictly military.\r\n\r\n  The part of the building occupied by the music school, contains\r\nseparate rooms for practicing by individuals, class-rooms, and\r\ndormitories. There are rooms in the main pile for the meetings of\r\nteachers, for a small library, &c.\r\n\r\n  The executive board of this school depends partly on the ministry of\r\nwar, and partly on that of public instruction; the former, however, is\r\nthe controlling authority. Under this board is the military\r\nsuperintendent, or director, to whom the chaplain, the secretaries, the\r\neconomist, the military superintendent of the day, the teachers,\r\ncommandants of companies, the inspectors of the trades’ and music\r\nschool, and other officers, are directly responsible. The clergyman is\r\nthe superintendent of the elementary school, and has a general charge of\r\nall the intellectual and religious instruction.\r\n\r\n  The orphan children of soldiers are received for maintenance, at any\r\nage, by the authorities of the establishment, but if under six years,\r\nare boarded with their friends or others until six, and then admitted\r\ninto the house at Potsdam; they remain there until fourteen or fifteen\r\nyears of age, and, if of sound constitution, are transferred to the\r\ntrade, or to the music school, where they remain four years, and whence\r\nthey pass, if their conduct has been good, to the school for\r\nnon-commissioned officers. I have never seen a body of young men all so\r\nwell physically developed as the pupils of the trade school, a result\r\nproduced by constant attention to their education on this point.\r\nChildren who are not healthy, or who have failed in the elementary\r\nschool, are apprenticed at fourteen, and the institution ceases to have\r\nthe charge of them.\r\n\r\n  In the _Elementary School_, the usual branches taught in the common\r\nschools of Prussia are pursued, including reading, writing, arithmetic,\r\nthe German language, geography, drawing, religious instruction, and a\r\nlittle natural history. The boys are divided into four classes,\r\naccording to their proficiency, and all the classes below the first are\r\nsubdivided into two sections, each being under the charge of a teacher,\r\nand having a separate recitation room. These sections contain about\r\nforty pupils each. A monitor of order from among the pupils, has charge\r\nof a section on entering and leaving the school-room, and render such\r\nservice as the master requires during the lesson; he is assisted by one\r\nof the class in the distribution of the books, slates, and other\r\nimplements of instruction. The teachers keep each a roll, upon which the\r\ncharacter of the recitation and conduct of the pupils is entered, and\r\nwhich is examined weekly by the chaplain, and submitted to the board of\r\nteachers at their meetings. No youth, who is below a certain grade upon\r\nthis roll, is permitted to enter the trades’ school. There are about\r\nfive hours of instruction on four days of the week, and about\r\ntwenty-three in the whole week. The holidays are, a week at Easter, four\r\ndays at Michaelmas, a fortnight in the latter half of July, and from the\r\ntwenty-third of December, to the second of January. For those who have\r\nno friends to go to, the Christmas festivities are kept up in the\r\nschool, as in the private families of the country.\r\n\r\n  The board of teachers meet once every fortnight, and the director, or\r\nhis substitute, or the chaplain, presides. At their meetings, all\r\nmatters relating to instruction and discipline are discussed.\r\n\r\n  The form of the discipline of the school is military, but a spirit of\r\nmildness tempers it, suiting it to the age of the pupils. The boys, in\r\ngeneral, are divided into four companies, each of which has a\r\ncommandant, (a non-commissioned officer of the highest grade,) who has\r\ncharge of the instruction in military exercises, and ranks with the\r\nteachers of the school. These companies form a battalion, and are\r\ndrilled without arms, and inspected by the director, or an officer\r\nappointed by him. In turn the commandants of companies, acting as\r\nofficers of the day, have general charge of the military and police\r\nduties. Two of the teachers, also, in turn, act as inspectors of the\r\nday, and have the general superintendence of the pupils in study and\r\nrecreation hours, in the duties of personal police, at meals, and in the\r\ndormitories, relieving each other at different parts of the day. They\r\nare co-ordinate in authority with the officer of the day, and he is\r\nexpected to relieve and aid them in the maintenance of order. These\r\nofficers report immediately to the director.\r\n\r\n  The four companies are subdivided into sections of eleven, over each\r\nof which one of the boys is placed, with the title of overseer, or\r\ncorporal, and he is responsible for the good order of his section, and\r\nmay be assisted in his duties by one chosen from it. From among these\r\ncorporals one is selected for the general control and superintendence of\r\nthe others, and marches the company to the lavatory, to meals, to the\r\ndormitory, &c., being responsible for them whenever they are collected\r\nas a company. The boys composing a section are placed at meals upon the\r\nsame side of the table with the corporal who has charge of them. The\r\nyounger pupils do not join these companies at once, but are kept\r\ntogether in a division which is under female superintendence, has a\r\nseparate overseer, and is under different regulations as to rising,\r\ngoing to bed, and other particulars of discipline and police from the\r\nelder pupils.\r\n\r\n  All the duties of domestic and personal police, and some of those of\r\ndomestic economy, are performed by the boys enrolled in the four\r\ncompanies. They clean their own shoes, brush their own clothes, attend\r\nto the police of the different parts of the building, serve the meals,\r\nand make their beds. That the various duties may be attended to in an\r\norderly way, there are, besides those already spoken of, special\r\noverseers appointed among the pupils, who have general charge of them\r\nwhile engaged in certain duties, and of particular localities. Thus\r\nthere is an overseer of the room where the clothes and shoes are kept,\r\nwho has charge of the exchange of the Sunday for week day dress, and\r\nvice versa; an overseer of the room where the shoes are brushed and\r\nblacked; an overseer of the lavatory; four superintendents of\r\ncleanliness, who direct the pupils while washing and combing their hair;\r\none of hair cutting; two of serving the table, who have charge of a\r\ndetail of thirty pupils, who serve and clear the tables and clean the\r\nknives and forks; one, of the manual labor classes; one, of the sick in\r\nthe hospital; one, of those who are unwell, and must report to the\r\nphysician; one, of the lights; one, to prevent the passing of bounds;\r\none the pupils who sing the liturgy in the church; one to conduct the\r\npupils, whose shoes require repairs, to the shoemaker; besides, those\r\nfor the classes and the younger boys, already mentioned, and a few\r\nothers. I make this enumeration in order to show the minuteness of the\r\narrangements for police and discipline, and the extent to which they are\r\nconducted by the pupils themselves. The selections for appointments are\r\nmade by the teachers and officers, and submitted to the chaplain and\r\ndirector for their approbation. A part of the pupils employed as\r\nsuperintendents receive small pecuniary allowances, and all enjoy many\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\n  Some of the pupils, who are found to have a taste for music, receive\r\nspecial lessons, and are employed, when sufficiently proficient, to give\r\nthe signals for the different duties of the day. Eight pupils are thus\r\nselected to be taught the bugle and fife, and twelve the drum.\r\n\r\n  In regard to conduct, the pupils are divided into four grades,\r\naccording to the reports of the teachers and officers, a revision of the\r\nclassification taking place every quarter, and the director having, in\r\nthe meantime, the power to displace a pupil in a case of emergency. The\r\nfirst class grade is composed of pupils distinguished for unvarying good\r\nconduct, and on holidays its members are allowed to leave the\r\norphan-house alone to make small purchases at discretion, and are\r\nneither subject to corporal punishment nor to the stoppage of their\r\nmeals. The second class is composed also of meritorious pupils, but of a\r\nlower grade of conduct than the first; they are permitted to leave the\r\nschool sometimes, but not so often as the others, and are generally\r\nunder supervision. From these two grades only, the superintendents or\r\noverseers are taken. Pupils of the third grade stand between those who\r\nare decidedly good or bad, and are treated accordingly. They are the\r\nlast who are permitted to pass from the elementary to the trades’\r\nschool, on completing their course in the former. Those of the fourth,\r\nor lowest grade, are kept constantly under supervision, have no\r\nallowances, no leaves of absence, are separated, when possible, from the\r\nrest of the pupils, and are even punished by an inferior diet.\r\n\r\n  The health of the pupils is promoted by frequent bodily exercise, and,\r\nwhen the weather permits, in the open air. Thus they have regular\r\ngymnastic exercises four times a week, are drilled by companies four\r\ntimes, and by battalion twice a week, take frequent walks, and in\r\nsummer, bathe every day. The regular manual labor in this department of\r\nthe school is confined to knitting and tailoring. The gymnastic\r\nexercises are conducted by two teachers, each taking charge of one of\r\nthe companies, of which two attend the lesson at the same time, and\r\nassisted by pupils selected from among the most proficient in the\r\nexercises. There are two swimming lessons given to each company, in\r\nsummer, every week. In the ordinary division of the day, in summer,\r\nbetween two and three hours are allowed for manual labor, the same for\r\nrecreation, two hours for exercise, and nearly eight for sleep.\r\n\r\n  Their clothing is a neat uniform jacket of blue cloth, of a military\r\nfashion, gray or white pantaloons for the winter, and a brown linen\r\njacket and white linen pantaloons for the summer, and their officers are\r\ndistinguished by badges similar to those worn in service. The diet is\r\ngenerous, and, besides the three meals, bread is served as a luncheon in\r\nthe morning and afternoon intervals.\r\n\r\n  An opportunity is given to those who are to pass into the trades’\r\nschool, to ascertain the trade which they may wish to follow, by a trial\r\nduring the last year of the elementary course.\r\n\r\n  The order of the day, with merely slight variations during four days\r\nof the week, in summer, is as follows:--The pupils rise at a quarter\r\nbefore five o’clock, and proceed by companies to the lavatory, two\r\ncompanies occupying it at once and alternating, the other two being,\r\nmeanwhile, engaged in cleaning their shoes. Wash and comb their hair. At\r\nhalf past five the boys detailed to serve the meals proceed to the\r\nrefectory under their two superintendents. At a quarter before six the\r\nbugle sounds, and the companies assemble, by sections, in the\r\ncourt-yard. Morning prayers and breakfast. Those who are slightly sick\r\nreport to the physician. At a quarter before seven, the boys assemble\r\naccording to classes, and at seven are marched to the school-rooms. At a\r\nquarter before nine a luncheon of bread is served out to them. School\r\ncloses at eleven, and the pupils are free for three-quarters of an hour.\r\nDinner at about a quarter before twelve. The pupils brush their clothes,\r\nand are inspected by the officer of the day. From a quarter past one to\r\nhalf-past two, review the morning lessons in school. From a quarter to\r\nthree until five, are occupied with manual labor in the work-rooms. Part\r\nof the pupils receive instruction in music, and the first and second\r\nclasses in drawing; a stated number take a swimming lesson; the\r\ndrummers, fifers, and buglers also have a lesson. A luncheon of bread is\r\ndistributed. One of the companies is at drill, one at gymnastics, and\r\nthe other pupils bathing or walking until seven. Evening prayers in the\r\nrefectory, and supper. Wash, and have recreation until nine, when they\r\nretire. The younger pupils retire at half-past eight.\r\n\r\n  In winter, the different occupations of the day are each one hour\r\nlater than in summer, until half-past two, when the hour of review of\r\nthe lessons is omitted, and the exercises, as far as appropriate to the\r\nseason, follow in the same order as in summer, until half-past five, at\r\nwhich hour the pupils go to the school-room, and remain until a quarter\r\nbefore seven.\r\n\r\n  On Wednesday and Saturday, an hour is devoted to religious\r\ninstruction, the other lessons being omitted, except the physical\r\nexercises on Wednesday. Stated days and periods of the day are assigned\r\nfor the exchange of the weekday clothes for those of Sunday, for taking\r\nclothes or shoes requiring repairs to the tailor or shoemaker of the\r\nestablishment, for hair-cutting and combing, for washing the neck and\r\nshoulders, the feet, and for other minute matters.\r\n\r\n  The object of the _Trade School_, is, in part, to economize the funds\r\nof the institution, by making within its walls articles of clothing\r\nrequired for the pupils, but more to secure the acquisition, not only of\r\ngeneral mechanical dexterity, but of a trade, which may serve to\r\nincrease their emoluments when they enter the military service. There\r\nare, at present, one hundred and four pupils.\r\n\r\n  In order to pass into the trades’ school from the elementary division,\r\nthe pupil must have reached at least the second class, have been above\r\nthe fourth grade in conduct, be between fourteen and fifteen years of\r\nage, and of a bodily constitution fitting him for the military service.\r\nThe course lasts three years. The school has a special inspector, or\r\nsuperintendent, who is responsible to the director of the whole\r\ninstitution, or, in fact, to his substitute.\r\n\r\n  The different trades now taught here are those of blacksmiths,\r\nsaddlers, tailors, shoemakers, and lithographers. The last named has but\r\nseven pupils admissible to its school, and the next to the last\r\nforty-four. These numbers depend upon the demand for the occupation\r\nsubsequent to leaving the establishment, the space required for the\r\noperations of the trade, the difficulty of teaching, &c. As each pupil\r\nis in general permitted, on advising with the inspector, to choose his\r\nemployment, it sometimes happens that boys are sent into the town to\r\nlearn a trade not taught in the school. Changes of occupation are very\r\nrare, but are sometimes permitted. The blacksmiths are principally\r\nengaged in the repairs of arms, the saddlers make the caps and\r\naccoutrements, &c., used in the house, the tailors all the uniforms, the\r\nshoemakers supply not only this orphan-house, but that of the girls with\r\nshoes, and the lithographers are occupied in copying forms for the\r\nschool or war department, manuals, &c. They work about seven hours a\r\nday, under a master-workman from the town.\r\n\r\n  An hour of each day is spent in gymnastic or military exercises in the\r\nopen air in summer, and in winter in the large room before spoken of.\r\nThe military exercises, besides the ordinary ones, comprise some which\r\nare peculiar to the Prussian service. The usual exercises of gymnastics\r\nare introduced, omitting any which seem to have a tendency towards the\r\ntricks of the mountebank. For instruction in these exercises, the whole\r\nschool is divided into two parts, and each again into squads, so that\r\nthe teacher need have but twelve to fourteen under his charge.\r\nNon-commissioned officers are the under teachers, and in turn are\r\nsuperintended by higher teachers, and by an inspector.\r\n\r\n  There can be no doubt that to these well regulated and perseveringly\r\ncontinued exercises it is, in great part, due that the physical\r\ndevelopment of these youths is, on the average, so perfect. Judicious\r\nrecreation, a proper diet and clothing, great cleanliness, a proper\r\nnumber of hours of work, of instruction and sleep, no doubt, are\r\nnecessary, each and all in their degree, but great influence must be\r\nbesides allowed to the gymnastic exercises.\r\n\r\n  The pupils have two hours of instruction during the day, intended to\r\nkeep up their knowledge of the branches taught in the elementary school,\r\nrather than to teach new ones. Military drawing is, however, added.\r\n\r\n  When not in the shops, nor in school, nor at exercise, they are\r\nsuperintended by non-commissioned officers. The discipline in this\r\nschool is military in spirit, as well as in details.\r\n\r\n  Those pupils who have manifested a decided musical talent in the lower\r\nschool, are here instructed thoroughly in the theory and practice of\r\nmusic. The object is to supply musicians to the regimental bands. These\r\npupils have a separate superintendence from those of the other schools,\r\nand different hours of exercise and duty. They keep up the knowledge\r\nacquired in the elementary school, as is done in the trades’ school.\r\n\r\n_Military Orphan-House at Annaburg._\r\n\r\nThe following plan of instruction was prepared by Dr. Harnisch, one of\r\nthe most distinguished teachers of Prussia, formerly Principal of the\r\nTeachers Seminary at Weissenfels.\r\n\r\nIn order to rise to the place of a non-commissioned officer, the pupil\r\nmust have gone through the lowest classes of the Upper School, where\r\nthere are the following studies:--\r\n\r\n  Religious instruction, arithmetic, singing, the German language,\r\ncalligraphy, geography and history, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\nThe courses in the different branches are arranged as follows:--\r\n\r\n  FIRST. _Religious Instruction._\r\n\r\n  LOWER SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n  Class VII.

Architectural drawing with instruments, drawings of\r\nfurniture, &c.\r\n\r\nDr. Bache makes the following remarks on the above plan:\r\n\r\n  I have allowed myself to present this extended programme, because it\r\nconveys, in as brief a compass as possible, excellent ideas of the\r\nsuccession of courses in an elementary school, and in a technical or\r\ntrade school, for such the higher school must be considered. It should\r\nbe remembered that the main purpose is the preparation of youth for the\r\nmilitary service, and hence that the wants of the service are especially\r\nconsulted. Another fact must be remembered, namely, that this is a\r\nLutheran school, and therefore the religious instruction is adapted to\r\nthe particular views of that church. The course of morals of the third\r\nclass, I must say, however, seems to me out of its place, for although\r\nour duties to God and our neighbor are of course best learned from his\r\nWord, yet their inculcation by precept and example can not commence too\r\nearly.\r\n\r\n  In the arithmetical course, the union of mental and written arithmetic\r\nis absolutely essential. The gradation appears to me good, and the\r\napplication to questions of common life gives a zest to such studies,\r\nattainable in no other way. The theory of arithmetical processes,\r\nhowever, should accompany or follow more nearly their practical\r\nacquisition. Indeed, if they are taught as they ought to be, by\r\ninduction, the theory goes with the practice.\r\n\r\n  If the youth at Annaburg take the same pleasure in the exercises of\r\nsong, from the elements to the completion of the musical course, as\r\nthose of the school[9] actually superintended by the author of this\r\nproject, the success will be complete.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: Seminary for Teachers at Weissenfels.]\r\n\r\n  The connection of orthography and writing, especially if combined with\r\nearly reading, is natural.\r\n\r\n  The exercises of induction, which in the lower classes are well drawn\r\nout, deviate from the appropriate track in the fourth class, and in the\r\ngeographical and historical courses do not return to it. The system in\r\nboth these branches is rather synthetical than inductive. There is a\r\ngreat temptation to break away from this method, into that of giving\r\npositive instruction, from the apparently greater rapidity of progress\r\nof the pupil; some teachers have abandoned it altogether, as too slow,\r\nthough ultimately to their cost, as appeared to me in cases where I had\r\nan opportunity of comparing the results.\r\n\r\n  The writing is preceded by an introductory course of drawing, which\r\nmight with excellent effect be so extended as to branch out into\r\ncomplete courses of drawing and writing.\r\n\r\n  As this plan results from an extended experience, the number of hours\r\nof instruction, per week, necessary to secure the results, is an\r\nimportant datum, and as such I have retained it, whenever it was\r\ninserted in the original programme.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SCHOOL DIVISION OR NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS’ SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nA military school of a somewhat peculiar character for training up young\r\nmen for the duties of non-commissioned or _under_ officers exist at\r\nPotsdam, and is known as the School Division.\r\n\r\nThe rules of the Prussian Military system, which require only three\r\nyears absolute service in the standing army in time of peace, evidently\r\nentail a great practical difficulty in this respect. The soldiers, as a\r\nrule, prefer to quit the service at the end of their three years’ time,\r\nand require great inducements to persuade them to remain. As one\r\ninducement, the state has declared that twelve years’ service gives a\r\nnon-commissioned officer a formal claim to civil employment; as, for\r\nexample, on the railways or in the custom-houses. Their pay also as\r\nnon-commissioned officers goes on increasing according to the length of\r\ntheir service; and it was stated to be the usual practice not to advance\r\nsoldiers to be non-commissioned officers until they had signed an\r\nundertaking to serve for a longer period than could be exacted of them\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nA further means of supplying the want has been sought, and appears to\r\nhave been found in the School Division. The circumstances of its origin\r\nhave placed this establishment in immediate connection with the Corps of\r\nGuards, to which, in a military sense, they belong, at whose\r\nhead-quarters, the town of Potsdam, their buildings are situated, and\r\nwhose garrison duty in the town they occasionally undertake.\r\n\r\nAt its first commencement the pupils chiefly came in drafts from the\r\nMilitary Orphan-Houses. But the applications from the country in general\r\nhave been so numerous that this practice has been, it is said,\r\nabandoned, and a higher class of admissions has been attempted. The\r\nCommander of the Battalion of _Landwehr_ for the Circle (_Kreis_)\r\nreceives all applications in that Circle; he sees that the candidate is\r\nexamined on the spot, in reading, writing, and cyphering; and forwards\r\nthe name, height, age, and other particulars (the _Nationale_) to the\r\nauthorities. The decision is said to be mostly made by the candidate’s\r\nheight, and his medical certificate, and to be rather a difficult\r\nmatter. Only one-third of the applications are successful. A new boy had\r\njust presented himself with his father at the time of our visit; both\r\nson and father were well dressed, and apparently belonged to the middle\r\nrather than the lower classes. There seems every reason to be satisfied\r\nwith the amount of acceptance with the country which the school had\r\nbegun to receive.\r\n\r\nThe age of admission is from seventeen to twenty, and the youth on\r\nentering the school takes a military engagement to give two years of\r\nservice in the standing army for each year of his maintenance at the\r\nschool, in addition of course to those three years of military service\r\nto which every Prussian is bound, but with the privilege of counting as\r\nmilitary service the period spent at the school.\r\n\r\nThe usual school course is one of three years, and his engagement is\r\nthus for a term of nine years; that is, deducting three spent at the\r\nschool, six years’ time with the troops.\r\n\r\nThe School Division is 496 strong; there are four companies of 124 men.\r\nThe whole body is commanded by a captain, or major, who has an adjutant.\r\nTo each company are attached four officers and fourteen non-commissioned\r\nofficers; the latter teach in the two first years, the former in the\r\nthird. The school course begins on the 1st of October; the afternoons of\r\nthree days in each week are employed in ordinary school instruction, but\r\nthe remainder of their time in winter and their whole time in summer is\r\ndevoted to military training. The school instruction is not carried\r\nbeyond reading, writing, and arithmetic up to the rule of three;\r\ngeography, drawing skeleton maps, and copying, and learning the\r\nsignificance of military representations of ground. Some very\r\nrespectable specimens of their skill in copying maps were produced; it\r\nappeared to be a favorite exercise.\r\n\r\nAbout 150 are admitted yearly, an extra number being taken to supply\r\npossible vacancies; about 130 yearly are drafted into the army, six\r\nusually as _under_ officers at once, forty at least with certificates of\r\nbeing qualified to receive the grade in a short time; and the whole\r\nnumber who go out have generally obtained their appointment before\r\ntwelve months are completed. The highest number that may go out at once\r\nas under (or non-commissioned) officers is twelve; three for each\r\ncompany. Many, however, have latterly, it is said, become so within six\r\nweeks after their leaving.\r\n\r\nWhere the young men are strong and full-grown, they are allowed to join\r\nthe army at the end of two years; their whole service (two years for\r\neach at the school) being therefore reduced to six years.\r\n\r\nYoung men, on the other hand, who show no disposition or likelihood to\r\nturn out good _under_ officers, are sent off to complete the usual time\r\nas privates.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of non-commissioned officers in the standing army who are\r\ntaken from the School Division was not easy to ascertain. It differs\r\nextremely in different regiments. In one, it was stated that out of the\r\nordinary complement of 180, fifty came from hence. On the other hand, it\r\nwas asserted that the general proportion was not more than one in forty.\r\nA certain number have obtained commissions; but no prospect of such\r\npromotion appears to be held out, and any tendency to carry forward the\r\nstudies with a view to it is discouraged and checked.\r\n\r\nThe buildings, in the outskirts of Potsdam, are large, new, and\r\nhandsome, forming three sides of a spacious court or imperfect\r\nquadrangle. The dining-rooms are used also as exercise-rooms, and it was\r\nmade a point to let us see a portion of the pupils go through their\r\ngymnastics and exercises; and more particularly their sword and bayonet\r\nexercise. Twenty or thirty young men, very healthy and strong-looking,\r\nwent through the latter exercise in two lines; after which came a single\r\ncombat with the bayonet, all under the direction of an officer.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping-rooms are fairly large, and well ventilated, on the same\r\nfloor. Twelve slept in each. During the day the wooden bedsteads are\r\nplaced one above another. It was said that iron bedsteads are being\r\ngenerally introduced. Each young soldier is provided with a small\r\ncupboard above his bed. The non-commissioned officers had horsehair, the\r\nyoung men themselves straw paillasses. There was a stove in the room,\r\nbut it was said not to be used.\r\n\r\nThe school-rooms are on the upper floor. The skeleton maps already\r\nreferred to were here produced; one, of the two hemispheres, others\r\nillustrating Prussian history, showing the original size of the Prussian\r\nterritory, its extent and condition under Frederick the Great, the whole\r\ncourse of its gradual extention, &c., very fairly drawn, and creditable\r\nto the young men.\r\n\r\nThe time devoted to the training which is given in the School Division\r\nappears long. What is now done in three years might as well be done in\r\nhalf that time. The object, however, is secured of retaining the service\r\nof the men during a lengthened period in the standing army.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThe Regimental Schools are chiefly intended to train up non-commissioned\r\nofficers. This is more particularly the case in the artillery, which\r\ndoes not obtain its _under_ officers from the School Division at\r\nPotsdam.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE NOBLE-SCHOOL AT LIEGNITZ.\r\n\r\nThe Noble-School at Liegnitz is merely an endowed school, founded by the\r\nEmperor Joseph I. while Silesia was yet an Austrian dependency, and\r\nspecially intended for young men of good birth in that country. There\r\nare some military foundations in the school for the sons of officers of\r\ngood birth; and the two military men who take part in the instruction\r\nare paid by the state, on the same footing as officers employed in the\r\nState Military Schools.\r\n\r\n   *   *   *\r\n\r\n[Of one of the Institutions above described (The Artillery and\r\nEngineers’ School at Berlin) we shall give a fuller account, and in the\r\nmeantime we close this comprehensive survey of military instruction in\r\nPrussia with the following reflections of the English Commissioners.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. GENERAL REMARKS ON THE SYSTEM OF MILITARY EDUCATION IN PRUSSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Attention has often been drawn to the peculiar feature of Prussian\r\nMilitary Education, the double examination for the rank of officer. The\r\nprinciple adopted seems to be the exaction of a proof from _all_\r\nofficers that they have received a good, general, and professional\r\neducation, rather than the selection of a smaller number for higher\r\ntraining in a military school. The decree of 1808 first laid down the\r\nrule for the whole army, “that the only title to an officer’s commission\r\nshall be, in a time of peace, education and professional knowledge,--in\r\ntime of war, distinguished valor and ability.”\r\n\r\n2. The spirit of emulation is not so much called out in Prussia as it is\r\nin France. Early distinctions are acknowledged and appealed to, but\r\nsomewhat sparingly. The following words express the view taken on this\r\npoint:--\r\n\r\n“A testimonial of fitness for the University,” says Colonel von\r\nHolleben, (_i.e._, to have passed the Abiturient examination) “dispenses\r\nwith the examination for the ensigncy. In consequence of this rule fifty\r\n_Abiturients_ on an average annually enter the army. These, as well as\r\nthe _Selectaner_ of the Cadet Corps, must be considered in point of\r\nscientific education, an excellent supply of officers.”\r\n\r\n3. It will be seen that in the above words there is no reference to\r\nthose rewards and advantages which are the stimulus of competition.\r\nThere appears some want in this respect both in the earlier and later\r\ntraining of officers. Thus, in the instance of the Cadet House, there\r\nare numerous _free places_, but these are assigned to young men, not\r\nfrom any proof of merit or exertion, but entirely because they are the\r\nsons of officers or state servants. The most distinguished pupils, the\r\n_Selectaner_ gain nothing more than to be permitted to pass these two\r\nexaminations before, instead of after, entering the army. Honorable\r\nmention, is, however, made of the candidates for commission who\r\ndistinguish themselves in the Division Schools. But in the Staff\r\nSchool--the natural resource of energetic young officers--the\r\ncompetition (which the school asserts as its principle by its entrance\r\nexamination) loses some of its force, by the order of the pupils on\r\nleaving the school not being distinctly marked. It should be mentioned\r\nas an explanation of these facts, that in the general civil education of\r\nPrussia, competition is little encouraged, less than in our own, and far\r\nless than in the French, or even in the Austrian education.\r\n\r\n4. The military system of Prussia, and in some degree its military\r\neducation also, appear to have various objects in view. Thus the Cadet\r\nHouses, where the free places are chiefly given to the sons of military\r\nmen, seem intended to keep up a military _esprit de corps_, and it is\r\nimpossible not to be struck by the strong class spirit prevailing in the\r\nPrussian army. At the same time means are taken, as above stated, to\r\nobtain a good supply of highly educated officers.\r\n\r\n5. Prussian military education seems to have been constantly correcting\r\nand extending itself. Of this the Division Schools are a striking\r\nexample; and they deserve attention, both because their plan is peculiar\r\nto Prussia, and for the improvements they have received. The Prussians\r\nat first established numerous Division Schools, but they afterwards\r\ngreatly diminished their number; and the general inspector of military\r\neducation now contemplates, both for the sake of the instructors and\r\ntheir pupils, a further reduction to three or four. A large military\r\nschool in three or four towns in Prussia, intended to teach professional\r\nknowledge to young officers after some short practical experience in the\r\narmy, is thought a better mode of giving such knowledge than to place\r\nisolated, or few teachers, in regiments or army divisions.\r\n\r\n6. One chief means of improvement has been the bringing the whole\r\neducation under a single head. At first there were distinct boards for\r\nthe examinations in Prussia, and for the schools, with a view to\r\nmaintain the independence of each. It was found, however, that this led\r\nto a want of harmony between the schools and the examinations; and\r\naccordingly, whilst the board of examiners and the school professors are\r\nkept perfectly distinct, they are both subjected to the general\r\ninspector, who controls all the departments of military education. The\r\neffect of this has been to give more unity to all the teaching; an\r\nessential point where that teaching is entirely on the same subjects. By\r\nconstant inspection of the schools, and the receipt of periodical\r\nreports from them, the general inspector of military education is able\r\nto compare the results of each, and to keep the whole system going at an\r\neven rate of progress.\r\n\r\n7. Attention should be drawn to the somewhat complicated system for\r\nworking the Military Schools in Prussia. There are two distinct boards,\r\nas we have noticed above, the supreme board of studies and the\r\nexaminations board, one of which reports to the inspector-general on all\r\nexaminations, whilst the other acts as his assessors and advisers with\r\nregard to the schools and on all other subjects of military education.\r\nBesides these bodies, each school has its own board of studies, which is\r\ngenerally formed by some one person belonging to the school, combined\r\nwith distinguished officers or professors. Suggestions with regard to\r\neach school appear to originate chiefly from these latter bodies.\r\n\r\n8. The department of military examinations and education is under the\r\ncontrol of the general inspector, who “lays his proposals on matters of\r\nadministration before the minister of war, but reports directly to the\r\nking in all matters relating to instruction and examinations.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARTILLERY AND ENGINEERS’ SCHOOL AT BERLIN.[10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: Translated from Helldorf’s “_Dienst-Vorschriften der\r\n    Könighlich-Preussischen Armée_.”]\r\n\r\nOBJECT AND COURSE OF STUDY.\r\n\r\nThe object of the ARTILLERY AND ENGINEER SCHOOL is to give to such young\r\nmen of the Artillery and Engineers as have been found fitted for\r\npromotion, the education necessary for the proper performance of the\r\nduties of a Subaltern Officer, and to enable them to draw profit\r\nafterwards from their private studies and the practice of the service.\r\n\r\nThe complete course of study lasts two years and three quarters. The\r\ninstruction is divided into three courses, bearing the name of _cœtus_;\r\non joining the institution, the young men enter the first cœtus. Before\r\nthe commencement of the studies, that is, about the 1st of October, the\r\nGeneral Inspectors of the two corps direct the young men who are to\r\nenter the school to come up from their regiments and divisions. They\r\nreceive their pay and clothing from their regiments until they are\r\npromoted to the rank of Officer.\r\n\r\nThe first nine months of each year of study are principally devoted to\r\ntheoretical instruction, the three last exclusively to practice. In the\r\nthird cœtus, the course finishes with the theoretical instruction on the\r\n1st of July.\r\n\r\nThe instruction of the first cœtus is directed to prepare the students\r\nfor the ordinary Officers’ Examination, and at the same time to enable\r\nthem to follow with advantage the further studies of the school. The\r\ninstruction, during the first year, is common to all the students. Those\r\nwho pass the Officers’ Examination enter at the commencement of the\r\nsecond year into the second cœtus.\r\n\r\nIn the second cœtus the greater portion of the instruction, but not the\r\nwhole, is common to the two arms. In the third cœtus an almost entire\r\nseparation of studies takes place.\r\n\r\nIn all the studies which are common to the two arms, if the number of\r\nstudents is too great for a single class, parallel classes are\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nTHE STAFF AND AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\n_A.--The Superior Authorities._\r\n\r\nThe _Curatorium_ of the School is composed of the General Inspectors of\r\nthe two corps. To it belongs the authority of issuing orders and\r\nregulations; no important change in these can be made without its\r\nsanction.\r\n\r\nThe General Inspector of Military Instruction receives yearly at fixed\r\nperiods, reports upon the state and progress of the school.\r\n\r\nThe accounts are under the control of the War Department, with which the\r\nDirector of the School is in immediate communication. Questions of\r\nprinciple and unforeseen cases of importance are decided by the\r\n_Curatorium_.\r\n\r\nThe Inspector of the School, who is an Engineer Officer when the\r\nDirector is an Artillery Officer, and _vice versâ_, has the immediate\r\noversight of it. It is his duty to see that the orders and regulations\r\nare strictly followed.\r\n\r\n_B.--The Executive Authorities._\r\n\r\nThe Director is appointed by the King. He is a Field Officer of either\r\nArtillery or Engineers, and has the rank of Commandant of a regiment. He\r\nhas as assistant, a Captain appointed by the _Curatorium_. The Director\r\nis immediately responsible for the discipline and the finance of the\r\nestablishment, and conducts its ordinary details, assisted by the\r\nCaptain. He is also President of the Board of Studies; as such he\r\nexercises a general control over the instruction, and regulates the\r\nordinary examinations.\r\n\r\nUnder the Director and the Board of Studies are four officers, three\r\ntaken from the Artillery and one from the Engineers. They have the\r\nimmediate charge of the students, and are themselves under the direct\r\norders of the Captain.\r\n\r\nThe duties of Paymaster, Librarian, &c., are divided among them. They\r\nmust also give at least two hours of instruction weekly to the pupils.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Studies consists of the Director of the Institution as\r\nPresident, and usually of the Senior Master of Mathematics, and the\r\nInstructors of Artillery and Engineering in the third cœtus. In equal\r\nnumbers are likewise added Superior Officers of the Artillery and\r\nEngineers appointed by the _Curatorium_. The duty of the Board is to\r\ncontrol the whole of the instruction, and to give an opinion when\r\nrequired, upon the performance and capacities of the teachers and\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n_C.--The Teachers._\r\n\r\nThe teachers are to be selected as much as possible from among the\r\nOfficers of Artillery and Engineers. Where this can not be effected,\r\ncivilians of proved ability and experience are to be appointed.\r\n\r\nThe number of teachers is to be arranged with reference to the amount\r\nand extent of the studies, in such a manner that in the event of illness\r\namong them, no interruption in the instruction may arise. In addition to\r\nthe teachers, there is a certain number of assistant-teachers, partly\r\ncivilians, partly taken from among the fireworkers of the Artillery. The\r\nlatter are employed under the Librarian, and in the practical\r\ninstruction; they may also, in case of necessity, assist as clerks.\r\n\r\nTHE STUDENTS.\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of students who enter each year is 80; 60 from the\r\nArtillery, and 20 from the Engineers. In addition, a few young men may\r\nbe received from the smaller German States. In the event of the number\r\nfrom one corps being short, an increased number may be admitted from the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe number in the second cœtus is variable. It consists, first, of the\r\nstudents previously in the first cœtus who have passed the Officers’\r\nExamination; and, secondly, of such young officers as are appointed to\r\nthe Institution by the General Inspectors.\r\n\r\nThe students of the first cœtus lodge, as far as room will admit, in the\r\nschool buildings; the remainder, as well as the ensigns of the second\r\ncœtus, not yet promoted to officers, are quartered in a neighboring\r\nbuilding. At least two of the direction officers lodge in the school\r\nbuildings; a third lodges in the other.\r\n\r\nThe Director may grant permission to a student, as a matter of favor, to\r\nlodge with his parents.\r\n\r\nThe students quartered in the school and the neighboring building dine\r\ntogether in the mess-room of the school.\r\n\r\nThe officers (students) of the second and third cœtus live in lodgings\r\nin the town, and mess where they choose.\r\n\r\nENTRY INTO THE SCHOOL, AND PASSAGE THROUGH IT.\r\n\r\nThe entry into the first cœtus of the institution is conditional on the\r\napplicant having passed, in the manner officially prescribed, the\r\nexamination for ensign. The necessary certificates are forwarded to the\r\nDirector of the School.\r\n\r\nThe instruction in the first cœtus embraces in general the subjects\r\nrequired for the ordinary Officers’ Examination, that is to say, the\r\nelements of Military Science, so far as every Subaltern Officer is\r\nobliged to know them. To this is to be added instruction in mathematics,\r\nin French, and in free sketching.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the instruction the teachers inspect the whole of\r\nthe Ensign-Examination papers of the newly-arrived students, which are\r\nlaid before them by the Director, in order the better to judge of their\r\nacquirements. During the first quarter they take pains to ascertain the\r\nability as well as the amount of acquirements of each student, so as to\r\nbe able to give a confident opinion upon him at the end of the quarter.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the first quarter a conference of the teachers, under\r\nthe presidence of the Director, takes place, to form a report upon the\r\nstudents, and to furnish data for recommendations to the rank of ensign\r\nof such students as have given satisfaction by their conduct and\r\nprogress. The students about whom the teachers have not yet been able to\r\nspeak confidently, who, in certain studies, as in mathematics and the\r\nspecial branches of their arm, are behind-hand, as well as those whose\r\nconduct has not been without blame, are proposed to the higher\r\nauthorities for permission to continue to remain at the school. On the\r\nother hand, the Board of Studies proposes for dismissal from the\r\ninstitution, students whose conduct has been unsatisfactory, and\r\nprincipally who give too little hope of a favorable career. The Board is\r\nto express an opinion whether any prospect may be held out of a future\r\nrecall to the institution, according as its unfavorable report has been\r\nfounded on the want of ability or on the want of industry of the\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\nThe students favorably reported on are immediately, by the General\r\nInspectors, appointed ensigns, subject to vacancies. The _Curatorium_\r\ndecides regarding the further stay at the institution, or the dismissal\r\nof the others.\r\n\r\nAfter the end of the second quarter, those pupils who can not yet be\r\nrecommended for promotion to ensign are only in special cases allowed to\r\nremain till the end of the theoretical instruction of this year; if they\r\ncan not then be recommended, they are sent back to their regiments.\r\n\r\nFourteen days before the close of the theoretical instruction for the\r\nyear, that is to say, about the middle of June, the teachers give an\r\nopinion regarding each student of the first cœtus, as to whether or not\r\nthey consider him capable of undergoing the Officers’ Examination, and\r\nto pass into the second cœtus. These reports, joined to that of the\r\nDirector, as regards the conduct of the students, enable the Board of\r\nStudies to propose to the higher authorities either that permission may\r\nbe granted to undergo the Officers’ Examination, (and, if successful, to\r\nenter the second cœtus,) or that the student be sent back to his corps.\r\nStudents who have been refused permission on grounds not altogether\r\nunpardonable, from presenting themselves for the Officers’ Examination,\r\nor who in the course of instruction have been sent for any reason to\r\ntheir corps, with the prospect of being afterwards called back to the\r\nschool, may, on the proposition of the Board of Studies, through the\r\n_Curatorium_, be granted a second and final entrance into the first\r\ncœtus.\r\n\r\nThe _Curatorium_ decides in every case whether a student who has not\r\nqualified himself for entry into the second cœtus, may return to the\r\nfirst cœtus after having left the institution, or in case he shall have\r\nin the meantime passed the Officers’ Examination, whether he may, as an\r\nexceptional case, enter the second cœtus. In a case of the latter kind,\r\nthe applicant can not present himself for the Officers’ Examination\r\nwithout having previously passed a preliminary examination at the\r\nschool, to do which, the permission of the General Inspector of his\r\ncorps is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical course closes at the end of June. During the month of\r\nJuly the students of the first cœtus are employed in surveying\r\noperations. It is during this month that the examination for the rank of\r\nofficer before the General Examining Board takes place. The students who\r\npass this examination enter afterwards into the second cœtus; those who\r\nfail are, at the expiration of the practical course of their year, sent\r\nback to their corps.\r\n\r\nThe students who pass the Officers’ Examination, and are found qualified\r\nto enter the second cœtus, are then proposed for election to the\r\nofficers of their corps. If the decision be favorable, their names are\r\nsubmitted by the General Inspectors to the King, to be appointed, on\r\nvacancies occurring, to the rank of Supernumerary (_Ausseretatsmässigen_)\r\nSecond Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nTo assist the Officers of the Corps in making their election, an extract\r\nof the reports above alluded to is sent to them, so far as it concerns\r\nthe students who have successfully passed their Officers’ Examination.\r\n\r\nIt is an indispensable condition for entering the second cœtus, that, if\r\na student of the first cœtus, he should have passed the Officers’\r\nExamination, or if he should now enter the school for the first time,\r\nthat he should have the rank of Officer. The sum of acquirements\r\nnecessary for the Officers’ Examination forms the basis of the\r\ninstruction given in the second cœtus. In it the instruction ceases to\r\nbe entirely common to the two arms.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the theoretical course of the second cœtus, a report of\r\nprogress and conduct is drawn up, as in the first cœtus, by the Board of\r\nStudies, on the data furnished by the teachers as regards the studies,\r\nand by the Director as concerns the conduct of the students. In\r\nforwarding this report to the _Curatorium_, it is stated for each\r\nstudent whether or not he is considered qualified to pass the _former\r\npart_ of the Special Corps Examination. Those who are unfavorably spoken\r\nof in this respect return to their corps, if there are no mitigating\r\ncircumstances which permit a further stay in the second cœtus, following\r\nthe decision of the _Curatorium_. They may either endeavor to obtain a\r\ntransfer into another branch of the army, or by study and good conduct\r\nprepare themselves for admission into the third cœtus at a future\r\nperiod. But in this case they must not only be recommended by their\r\ncorps, but they must also pass the _former part_ of the Special Corps\r\nExamination.\r\n\r\nThe students recommended to present themselves for the _former part_ of\r\nthe Special Corps Examination undergo it before a Board appointed by the\r\nchiefs of the two corps in the beginning of July. It extends over the\r\nsubjects of professional science which have been taught in the second\r\ncœtus. A particular regulation defines the mode of this examination,\r\nwhich is entirely written; it decides whether the student shall enter or\r\nnot into the third cœtus.\r\n\r\nThe successful students pass, by direction of the _Curatorium_, into the\r\nthird cœtus, while the unsuccessful ones, as well as those who have been\r\nreported unfit to undergo the examination, return to their corps. By\r\ngood conduct and study they may obtain permission to come up again at\r\nthe next examination for the _former part_ of the Special Examination.\r\nTheir definite return to the school depends upon their passing this\r\nexamination, and upon the express order of the _Curatorium_.\r\n\r\nThe instruction in the third cœtus is chiefly directed to supply the\r\nspecial scientific knowledge required by each of the two arms. The\r\nstudents of the two corps, therefore, receive separate instruction. A\r\nfurther object of the instruction is to enable the students to make use\r\nof the knowledge which they have acquired, on which account instruction\r\nand practical application go hand in hand. Practice and theory go thus\r\ntogether in this the highest portion of the instruction, so that they\r\nboth terminate at the same time, namely, at the end of the month of\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nPrevious to leaving the School, the _latter part_ of the Special Corps\r\nExamination is undergone before the same Board as for the _former part_.\r\nThis examination tests their qualifications in their special arm, and\r\nproves their fitness for Artillery or Engineer Officers. The results of\r\nthis part of the examination and of the former part of it passed at the\r\nclose of the second cœtus, are combined by the Board, and forwarded to\r\nthe _Curatorium_. Along with these reports is submitted a proposition\r\nfor those who have passed the examinations to be admitted into their\r\ncorps. In the preparation of patents (for commissions) they are\r\nantedated to the time of passing the Officers’ Examinations, proper\r\nregard being had to the results of the Special Corps Examination for\r\narranging the officers among each other.\r\n\r\nAny officer who does not pass the Special Corps Examination, remains\r\nwith the pay of an infantry officer in his corps until he either enters\r\ninto another arm, or having obtained permission to re-enter the third\r\ncœtus, he qualifies himself for the final examination. A successful\r\npassing of the Special Corps Examination at this second trial can give,\r\nunder the most favorable circumstances, no higher seniority than that of\r\nimmediately after the officers who have passed their examination the\r\nprevious year.\r\n\r\nA.--_The Instruction in General._\r\n\r\nThe general instruction may be divided into--\r\n\r\n1. The theoretical part, designed with the view to the practical\r\nprofessional requirements of the students, and their further\r\nself-improvement.\r\n\r\nThe instruction ranges over--\r\n\r\n  (_a._) Artillery.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) Military Engineering.\r\n\r\n  (_c._) Hydraulic Construction.\r\n\r\n  (_d._) Elements of Tactics.\r\n\r\n  (_e._) History of the Art of War.\r\n\r\n  (_f._) Mathematics.\r\n\r\n  (_g._) Theory of Surveying.\r\n\r\n  (_h._) Physics.\r\n\r\n  (_i._) Chemistry.\r\n\r\n  (_k._) French Language.\r\n\r\n  (_l._) Rules and Regulations of the Service.\r\n\r\n  (_m._) The Horse.\r\n\r\n  (_n._) Plan Drawing.\r\n\r\n  (_o._) Free Sketching.\r\n\r\n  (_p._) Descriptive Geometry.\r\n\r\n  (_q._) Artillery Drawing.\r\n\r\n  (_r._) Artillery Constructions Drawing.\r\n\r\n  (_s._) Fortification Drawing.\r\n\r\n  (_t._) Architectural Drawing.\r\n\r\n2. The practical part of the instruction, designed by a series of\r\npractical exercises to exhibit the application of the theory taught and\r\nto extend the knowledge previously acquired.\r\n\r\nThe practical part includes--\r\n\r\n  (_a._) Visits to the Military Establishments and Institutions in\r\nBerlin and Spandau, examination of the objects, collections, models,\r\n&c., which they contain.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) Chemical manipulation.\r\n\r\n  (_c._) Examination of raw materials, of cannon, limbers, and\r\nammunition wagons, of shot and shells, and of small-arms.\r\n\r\n  (_d._) Management of machines.\r\n\r\n  (_e._) Practical exemplification of the rules for placing guns with\r\nreference to the ground, and to tactical considerations.\r\n\r\n  (_f._) Marking out and tracing batteries and field-works.\r\n\r\n  (_g._) Drawings from Artillery objects, and from buildings, &c.\r\n\r\n  (_h._) Being present at the practical operations of the Engineer\r\nDivision of the Guards.\r\n\r\n  (_i._) Solution of problems in the attack and defense of fortresses.\r\n\r\n  (_k._) Practice in elementary tactics.\r\n\r\n  (_l._) Practical surveying.\r\n\r\n  (_m._) Artillery practice.\r\n\r\n3. A course of Military and Gymnastic Exercises, requisite to prepare\r\nOfficers for active military service.\r\n\r\nThey are divided into--\r\n\r\n  (_a._) Exercises on foot.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) Exercises with the different kinds of guns in position.\r\n\r\n  (_c._) Fencing and gymnastics.\r\n\r\nB.--_Instruction in Detail--The theoretical Part._\r\n\r\nThe theoretical studies commence each year on the 1st of October, and\r\nend on the 30th of June. They may be reckoned, after deducting the\r\nvacation and holidays, to include a period of thirty-five weeks.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the studies take place only in the forenoon, namely,\r\nduring the five hours between eight and one o’clock. Occasionally only\r\nare there hours of study for a small part of the students in the\r\nafternoon. A portion of the afternoons, during the theoretical course,\r\nare employed for drills and practice, but in no case more than twice a\r\nweek, in order that the students may have the necessary time for\r\nrecreation. The students are required (those who are officers excepted)\r\nto remain in their quarters in the evening, to prepare the work which\r\nhas been allotted to them by the teachers.\r\n\r\nThe parallel classes of each cœtus, with the exception of the drawing\r\nclasses, are, as a general rule, to be under the same teacher.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical instruction is distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  AMOUNT OF STUDIES,  WEEKLY.\r\n\r\n  Art.

The larger portion of the instruction, as the table shows, is\r\ncommon; in Plan Drawing the only difference is that the Engineers\r\nreceive two hours’ additional instruction.\r\n\r\n  2. The instruction in French, for a select number of the most advanced\r\nstudents only, takes place on two afternoons.\r\n\r\n  3. The instruction in Free Sketching for the Engineers takes place\r\nalso on two afternoons.\r\n\r\nIn the third cœtus:--\r\n\r\n  1. About one-half only of the instruction in this class is common; in\r\nPlan Drawing the Engineers have one hour more instruction a week.\r\n\r\n  2. The Chemical Manipulations (in which a very small number only of\r\nthe students share) take place on two afternoons.\r\n\r\n  3. The instruction in French, in which only those already selected in\r\nthe second cœtus take part, also is given on two afternoons.\r\n\r\n  4. For mathematical instruction the class is formed into two\r\ndivisions. The first consists of those pupils who, in the opinion of the\r\nteachers, are able to follow profitably the instruction in the higher\r\nmathematics. The remainder form the second division, and go over a\r\nsecond time what they have already learned, to which is added a variety\r\nof questions in applied mathematics, important to the Artillery and the\r\nEngineers.\r\n\r\n  TENOR OF THE STUDIES IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n  _First Cœtus._\r\n\r\n  _Artillery._--Elementary Description of all the _matériel_ of the\r\nPrussian Artillery, and of the basis of its arrangement.

The higher geometry.\r\nAnalytical mechanics and hydraulics.\r\n\r\n  (For the second division, about three-quarters of the\r\nclass.)--Repetition of the most important part of the studies already\r\ngone through in the first and second cœtus, with practical useful\r\nproblems. Mechanics and hydraulics, as well as some instruction\r\nnecessary for artillerists, but so as not to require the higher\r\nanalysis, and more of a practical than of a theoretical nature.\r\n\r\n  _Chemistry_ (Instruction.)--The necessary preliminary knowledge of\r\ntheoretical principles. Treatise of separate substances (of the\r\nmetalloids and their indifferent combinations, of the acids, of the\r\nmetals,) all illustrated by experiments.

Problems on\r\nthe construction of existing and not existing guns, carriages, &c.\r\nConstruction of the artillery _matériel_ of foreign powers.\r\n\r\n  _Fortification Drawing._--Projects of field fortification, to be\r\nconstructed of earth, or of earth and gabions, with application to the\r\nnature of the ground. Drawings with the use of Von Prittwitz’ copies of\r\nthe fortification of places, as a continuation of the fortification\r\ndrawings begun in the second cœtus. For all these exercises in projects\r\nand drawings, the concert of the teacher of exclusive engineering is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n  _Plan Drawing._--Practice in copying and reducing large plans. Drawing\r\nof plans of battles with the position of the troops, and of plans of\r\nsieges, with the trenches and batteries.\r\n\r\n  _Architectural Drawing._--Architecture in its application to military\r\nbuildings, done in India ink. Finally, practical exercises in copying\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL EXERCISES.\r\n\r\nThese are carried on, as has been already remarked, in part during the\r\nnine months of theoretical instruction, on some of the afternoons, but\r\nthey principally take place during the three summer months of July,\r\nAugust, and September, in the forenoon. They commence early in the\r\nmorning, and often last till the afternoon, on which account there are\r\nno evening hours of study during this period. As the students of the\r\nthird cœtus return to their corps at the beginning of July, those of the\r\nfirst and second cœtus only take part in this practice. The visits to\r\nthe Fortress and Military Establishments of Spandau, and the preparation\r\nof projects of military constructions, and of reconnaissances, must be\r\nmade during the period of theoretical instruction. It is therefore\r\nsuspended for one day for the students of the first cœtus, and for three\r\ndays for the Artillery, and five days for the Engineer students of the\r\nthird cœtus.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of time for each cœtus is as follows:\r\n\r\n  DURING THE NINE MONTHS OF THEORETICAL INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n  [KEY]\r\n  1C   1st Cœtus.

The remaining two-thirds of September are given for\r\nvacation, as well to afford recreation to the teachers and students as\r\nto allow of the repairing and cleansing of the school-buildings.\r\n\r\nMILITARY AND GYMNASTIC EXERCISES.\r\n\r\nThe month of October is appointed by the Director to the fitting and\r\nmaking uniform the regimental clothing brought with the students from\r\ntheir corps. Military exercises then take place once a week for two\r\nhours in the afternoon, till the 1st of April, or for about five months.\r\n\r\nThe military exercises are carried on under officers of the garrison,\r\nnamely, a Captain and two Lieutenants of the Artillery of the Guard.\r\nThey put themselves in communication with the Director to arrange the\r\ntime, nature, and extent of the exercises.\r\n\r\nThe exercises consist of--\r\n\r\n1. _Exercises on Foot._--The whole of the first cœtus here take part,\r\nbut only so many of the second Cœtus as are required as non-commissioned\r\nofficers. Considering the composition of the squad, (Artillery and\r\nEngineers,) and the object of the exercise, the perfection of the\r\nstudents in company-drill is less to be attempted than the endeavor to\r\ngive to each a good position and carriage in the front as well as in the\r\nranks, and more particularly to accustom them to military order and\r\nprecision.\r\n\r\n2. _Exercises with different descriptions of Guns in Position._--In\r\npreference, the light field-pieces of the year 1842 are to be used for\r\ndrill, and correct, united and prompt execution required. With the\r\nsiege-guns, every student is instructed and practiced with at least one\r\ncalibre of each nature.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their military exercises, there are also--\r\n\r\n3. _Fencing and Gymnastics._--In these exercises the students of the\r\nfirst cœtus only take part, and for two hours of the afternoon each\r\nweek, during the first six months. There is neither time nor appliances\r\nto admit of the students arriving at a high state of excellence. The\r\npractice in fencing is only intended to give confidence in the use of\r\narms, that in gymnastics to produce activity, and to afford bodily\r\nexercise to young men much occupied in study.\r\n\r\nEXAMINATIONS AND CENSURES.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the several examinations already enumerated, by which the\r\nfitness of the students for a certain rank or for promotion into a\r\nhigher cœtus is shown, some other examinations take place.\r\n\r\n1. For the purpose of enabling the Director and the Board of Studies to\r\nlearn the progress of each separate student, and to confirm by their own\r\nknowledge the opinion given by the teachers, there is twice in each\r\nquarter an oral repetition of some portion of such instruction in the\r\nfirst and second cœtus. The period of the examination is previously\r\nnamed by the Director.\r\n\r\n2. To give a general view of the progress of the entire year, and to\r\nincite the students to study, a public oral examination of those in the\r\nfirst cœtus takes place at the close of the theoretical instruction, in\r\npresence of the higher authorities of the school, superior officers of\r\nthe two arms, and other persons interested.\r\n\r\nAs a further incitement to the students, and as a warning to those whose\r\ndiligence or conduct has not been satisfactory, the quarterly “censures”\r\nare read out to the assembled cœtus. In general the names of the\r\nstudents are not mentioned, a number known to the individual only being\r\nused instead. The best pupils are, however, openly commended by name.\r\n\r\nIn the first cœtus, on the other hand, those pupils who have obtained\r\nvery bad “censure” are mentioned by name.\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL RELATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe annual expense of the School is fixed at 16,049 dollars. The sum is\r\ndistributed as follows:--\r\n\r\n  _Personal._\r\n\r\n  Salaries and allowances of Teachers        10,731\r\n  Pay and allowances of the Staff,            3,478\r\n                                             ------ 14,209\r\n  Practical exercises,                          520\r\n  School necessaries,                           720\r\n  Keeping up materials for instruction,         110\r\n  Cleansing the rooms                           130\r\n  Lighting,                                     100\r\n  Bureau expenses,                              210\r\n  Covering unforeseen expenses,                  50\r\n                                             ------  1,800\r\n\r\nIn the event of war, and if the instruction is suspended for an\r\nindeterminate period, the salaries of the civil teachers cease.\r\nApplication is not to be made to the King for the grant of a provisional\r\nindemnity, except under very peculiar circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe payment of the salaries and allowances is made monthly and in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nThe administration of the funds is directly under the supervision of the\r\nDirector. The Treasurer carries out the details. The superior orders for\r\nthe administration of royal grants are most strictly to be followed.\r\n\r\nThe annual accounts are forwarded by the Director to the War Department.\r\n\r\nThe property of the School consists of--\r\n\r\nThe Library, the Collection of Instruments and Models for Artillery and\r\nEngineers, the Collection of Physical Instruments, the Collection of\r\nChemical Apparatus, and the School Utensils.\r\n\r\nThe principal object of the Library is to serve as materials of\r\ninstruction for the teachers and students, and the Officers of Artillery\r\nand Engineers present at the Institution. After that, as a center, for\r\nthe collection of all the best works, old and new, on Artillery and\r\nMilitary Engineering.\r\n\r\nThe Director and Board of Studies take care that the instruments and\r\napparatus for the studies are always kept complete and in good order. As\r\nthe means of the school do not thoroughly admit of the collections\r\nkeeping pace with the progress of science, special care is taken that at\r\nleast the most necessary articles are not absent.\r\n\r\nThe utensils of the school are kept always complete, under the\r\nsupervision of the Director.\r\n\r\nThe property of the school is examined yearly by the Director and Board\r\nof Studies, and a report to that effect sent in with the annual\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRAMMES OF THE PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS TAUGHT IN THE ARTILLERY AND\r\nENGINEER SCHOOL AT BERLIN.\r\n\r\nI. ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\nThe instruction must commence with the first elements of the science,\r\nsince the new arriving students have little preparatory knowledge. It\r\nmust be carried on to such an extent that the pupil may be able, after\r\ngoing through the first cœtus, to pass his _officer’s examination_, and\r\nafter the completion of the entire course, not only to show at his\r\n_special_ examination that he possesses the positive knowledge required\r\nfor the ordinary duties of the service, but also to prove that he is\r\nqualified for continuing his studies by himself.\r\n\r\nThe Engineer pupils who close their instruction in artillery at the end\r\nof the second cœtus, are to be instructed in the composition of\r\nartillery, in the effect and the use of cannon, but more especially in\r\nits employment in sieges.\r\n\r\nFrom this general notice of the limits of the course it is evident that\r\nneither a perfect exposition of the theory nor complete practical\r\nexercises are expected. Still to train the students properly in the\r\ndifferent directions which an artillery education requires, the\r\ninstruction must not consist only in a theoretical lecture, but be aided\r\nby judicious directions for drawing, and be perfected by practical\r\nexercises. For the attainment of the two latter objects special\r\nprescriptions are given, to which we refer.\r\n\r\nInstruction in artillery is closely connected with the lectures on\r\nmathematics, physics, chemistry, tactics, fortification, and veterinary\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n_a._ As special points may be mentioned, _in mathematics_, calculation\r\nof contents, and fixing the centers of gravity, of cannon and its parts;\r\ncalculation of piles of shot; strength, direction, and distribution of\r\nrecoil on the separate portions of a piece of ordnance; theory of\r\nmachines, of carriages, of parabolic and projectile curves, and\r\ncalculation of the flight of rockets. In all these cases the\r\nmathematical lecturer develops the necessary formulas for the artillery\r\nstudent, but their application belongs to the course of artillery.\r\n\r\n_b._ _In physics._--Explanation, notice, and determination of the\r\nspecific gravities of the materials used in artillery. The law of\r\ngravity. The absolute and relative strength of woods and metals.\r\nFriction. Resistance of the air. Expansive power of gases, especially of\r\nthose generated by gunpowder.\r\n\r\n_c._ _In chemistry._--The general laws of chemical action of bodies on\r\none another. The simple elements of the materials used in artillery. The\r\nchemical properties of their combinations. The acids exhibited in the\r\ncombustion of gunpowder and their action on metals; the processes used\r\nin the reduction and manufacture of metals up to the point where they\r\nare fit for use in artillery; chemical analysis of gunpowder and of the\r\nmost common metal-alloys. The action of the atmosphere on substances\r\nexposed to it, which are used in artillery.\r\n\r\n_d._ _In tactics._--The organization and tactics of artillery, so far as\r\nthey stand in direct relation to other arms. A complete account of the\r\nconduct of artillery when coöperating with other troops.\r\n\r\n_e._ _In fortification._--Everything referring to the tracing, the\r\nrelief, and the construction of fortifications; attack and defense of\r\nfield-works by infantry and cavalry; complete exposition of the art of\r\nbesieging, with a discussion of all the duties of an engineer, a sapper\r\nor miner, both in the attack and the defense of a fortress, also the use\r\nof infantry and cavalry in sieges, with the omission of the points\r\nspecially belonging to artillery.\r\n\r\n_f._ _In the veterinary art._--The anatomy and physiology of the horse;\r\ngeneral rules for feeding, treatment of diseases, and disinfection of\r\nthe stables and utensils.\r\n\r\nThe instruction in the first cœtus must, as already mentioned, be so\r\ncalculated, that the students at the end of the course of lessons may be\r\nable to satisfy perfectly the requirements of the _Officer’s\r\nexamination_.\r\n\r\nAs a further prosecution of the same subjects of instruction in the\r\nsecond, and again in the third cœtus, would lead to a great loss of time\r\nand to tiresome repetitions, the lectures are to be so planned that the\r\nseparate subjects to be treated in the first and second cœtus, taken\r\ntogether, are of sufficient extent for the Engineer pupils in general;\r\nthe further developments necessary for the Artillery pupils are reserved\r\nin preference for the third cœtus.\r\n\r\nA. IN THE FIRST CŒTUS.\r\n\r\nThe separate subjects of the lecture are--\r\n\r\n1. Definition and distribution of arms.\r\n\r\n2. Theory of gunpowder: component parts--manufacture--ignition--force.\r\nProving. Storing. Transporting. Necessary precautions in manufacturing.\r\nMarks of damaged powder, and the possibility of restoration. Mention of\r\nthe substances which may be used in place of gunpowder for various\r\nmilitary purposes.\r\n\r\n3. Cannon. Materials. Dispositions. Manufacture. Proving. Storing, and\r\nduration.\r\n\r\n4. Gun-carriages. Limbers and other artillery carriages. General\r\nexplanations on the construction of carriages, with particular reference\r\nto those used for artillery. Materials. Distribution and composition of\r\ngun-carriages. Limbers and wagons. Their examination and storing.\r\n\r\n5. Military combustibles. Elementary notions. General account of\r\nlaboratory work and regulations; also with reference to later\r\nproceedings in a laboratory, and, omitting all figures not absolutely\r\nnecessary, a description of the preparation of fire-works, matches,\r\nammunition both for artillery and for small-arms, signal lights, and\r\nparticular kinds of combustibles. Their packing and storing.\r\n\r\n6. The service, working, and moving of cannon, and of artillery\r\ncarriages, with account and description of the machines in use by the\r\nPrussian artillery; but without special explanation of the official\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n7. Firing. Theory of the movement of projectiles, of the effect caused\r\nby their movement, and the mode of turning this action to the best\r\naccount for military purposes. Elements of the theory of firing.\r\nPractice. Various descriptions of fire; their effect, and their\r\nemployment for various sorts of guns.\r\n\r\n8. Small and side-arms. Purpose and description of the composition and\r\narrangement of small-arms. Their manufacture, storing, and the practical\r\nrules for their use. Purpose and description of side-arms. Fabrication,\r\nproving, effect, and use of them.\r\n\r\nB. IN THE SECOND CŒTUS.\r\n\r\nThe instruction in the second cœtus is a continuation of the lectures of\r\nthe first cœtus, and embraces the use of artillery in the field and in\r\nsieges. Its object is to bring the Artillery students to that point,\r\nthat they are able, at its close, to discharge satisfactorily the\r\nordinary practical duties of the service, and be prepared to follow the\r\ncourse of the third cœtus, and to give to the Engineer students, who, in\r\nthe third cœtus no longer receive instruction in artillery, all the\r\nknowledge of the subject required for their future profession. The\r\ninstruction must therefore be complete enough for the Engineers, and\r\ngive the Artilterist a solid and thorough preparation for the third\r\ncœtus.\r\n\r\nInstruction in the second cœtus should comprise, in particular--\r\n\r\n1. The organization of the artillery: purpose and considerations in the\r\nputting together of all parts of artillery material, both in tactical\r\nand administrative respects, with historical mention of the diversities\r\nof practice of other Powers.\r\n\r\n2. The use of artillery in the field. Marching and tactical movements.\r\nTaking up position. The engagement itself, and conduct in some\r\nparticular cases; for example, in defile fighting, in entrenchments,\r\npassage of rivers, &c.\r\n\r\n3. Use of artillery in sieges:--\r\n\r\na. _For Attack._\r\n\r\nPlanning and throwing up the batteries. Preparation and use of the\r\ndifferent kinds of materials of construction. Different sorts of\r\nbatteries. Methods of construction. Repairing of damaged batteries, and\r\nthe calculation generally of all the materials necessary for\r\nconstructing them.\r\n\r\nPurpose and equipment of besieging batteries, with the preparations,\r\nspecial and general, for a regular attack.\r\n\r\nProceedings in the regular attack, and their modifications in irregular\r\nsorts of attack, occasioned by the situation of the fortress with\r\nreference to the surrounding ground, or by the special nature of the\r\ndefenses.\r\n\r\nProceedings after capture, and when the siege is raised.\r\n\r\nb. _For Defense._\r\n\r\nThe equipment of the fortress. Determination of its artillery.\r\nPreparations in the fortress when it is declared in a state of siege.\r\nConduct of the artillery in the regular attack, and against irregular\r\nmodes of attack, as well as in particular cases, such as when in\r\ndetached isolated works, when the place is relieved, or when the\r\ngarrison fight its way out.\r\n\r\nC. IN THE THIRD CŒTUS.\r\n\r\nIn the artillery course of the first and second cœtus, the students have\r\ngained a general knowledge of the materials of artillery, as well as its\r\norganization and use as an Arm; but the lectures were for the most part\r\nlimited to what was of the greatest immediate consequence, viz., the\r\ndescription of the actual condition and relations of the Prussian\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nThe object of the instruction given in the third cœtus is, on the one\r\nhand, to expose the scientific laws of artillery and its various parts,\r\nand, on the other, to track the historical development of the Arm, so as\r\nby this means, and by consideration of the constitution of foreign\r\nartilleries, to extend the views of the students beyond our own\r\npractice, thus, to form their judgment, and induce them to think and\r\ncontrive for themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the comparison of our own and foreign existing systems with the\r\nresults of scientific considerations, the teacher should proceed with\r\ncaution, and not raise in the young men the inclination to or the habit\r\nof crude and officious criticism. Investigation of things as they exist\r\nmust, therefore, not confine itself to the mere search after defects; it\r\ncan be only profitable when employed to test our own powers at\r\nimprovements, and to discern thereby the difficulties and impediments\r\nthat accompany them. The value which speculative reasoning has for the\r\npurposes of the artillery ought to be properly esteemed by the students,\r\nbut, in face of the results of experience, not be estimated too highly;\r\nand in the comparison of different artilleries one with another, the\r\ninfluence must not be overlooked which the peculiarities and the history\r\nof a country ever exert on its institutions.\r\n\r\nThe final aim of the artillery instruction in the third cœtus must be a\r\nhigher degree of preparation for the future practical ability of the\r\nstudents. As regards the material portion of the artillery, the students\r\nare to acquire a general knowledge of the construction, fabrication, and\r\nproving of the _matériel_, and for the tactical part, it is above all\r\nthings to be made an object that they be made capable, by the\r\ninstruction given them, of greater dexterity and confidence in dealing\r\nwith special cases in the field or in siege operations.\r\n\r\nThe instruction commences with:--\r\n\r\n1. Organization of the artillery service. The general relations of the\r\nartillery service are to be explained according to its different\r\npurposes, as an arm both in technical and administrative respects, then\r\nthe principles for the organization of the service and of its separate\r\nportions in peace and war are to be developed, and comparison made with\r\nthose carried out in the principal foreign artilleries.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, on the one hand, more details are to be gone into on\r\nthe different branches of the artillery service (field, siege, fortress,\r\nand coast artillery, the technical and the administrative branches,)\r\nthan was done in the second cœtus; and on the other, those\r\nconsiderations must be kept sight of in which the artillery appears as a\r\nportion of a greater whole, as in its relation to the Army and to the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n2. Artillery, regarded as an arm. Since the elementary rules for the use\r\nof artillery in war have been given already in the second cœtus it will\r\nbe the object in the third cœtus, first, to develop the principles of\r\nartillery tactics in the field, and in sieges, from an extended point of\r\nview, and then to apply the rules for the movements, placing in position\r\nand fighting of the artillery to the bodies now actually used in war,\r\nand to examine the great questions that may hence arise. For the field\r\nartillery, the tactics of single batteries and of masses of artillery\r\nand the collective relations of the artillery of a _corps d’armée_ and\r\nof an army, must be shown. For sieges there will be less occasion to\r\ntreat of the separate means of defense by artillery than of the various\r\ncombinations under different circumstances, of its diversified\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nTo give this instruction its most practical tendency, historical\r\nexamples of battles are to be taken, and not merely their results\r\nadduced, but the circumstances gone through in detail. These are to be\r\ncompared with the rules previously given, and the causes and effects of\r\nany discrepancies, as far as practicable, and with caution, explained.\r\n\r\nThemes are then given out of campaigns and sieges, in working which the\r\nstudents are to show applications of tactical rules under given\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAs regards the preparation for the field and the conduct in marches,\r\nquarters, camps, or bivouacs, what was necessary has already been taught\r\nin the second cœtus, as far as concerns a corps of artillery as large as\r\na battery. In the third cœtus, therefore, only more extensive and\r\nimportant relations have to be explained.\r\n\r\nFinally, as the students at the close of the third cœtus are to enter\r\nimmediately into active service in the regiments, it will be useful to\r\ngive them a general view of artillery duties in time of peace, of which\r\nno mention was made in the first and second cœtus, and to show the\r\nprinciples on which they rest. Further, the education of the men, the\r\nselection, management, and care of the artillery horses, instruction in\r\nriding and driving, the various exercises in serving and moving the\r\nguns, artillery practice, the different fatigue duties, conduct in\r\nmanœuvres, detachments, &c., are to be particularly explained.\r\n\r\n3. Artillery in a technical and administrative point of view. In the\r\ninstruction given in the first and second cœtus, a descriptive notice\r\nonly was given, as regards artillery material, of the arrangement and\r\neffect of what actually exists; and the reasons for this arrangement\r\nwere added only so far as was necessary for this principal object.\r\n\r\nIn the third cœtus the pupils are to learn by the inductive process how,\r\naccording to existing principles of natural science and of tactics, with\r\nthe known mathematical and technical aids, artillery material must be\r\ncontracted, manufactured, and proved, so as to obtain the desired end in\r\nthe highest degree; and then our existing material and that of other\r\ncountries are to be compared in the manner above stated with the results\r\nthus obtained.\r\n\r\nTo this end, in the lectures, first, the necessary explanations of\r\nartillery requirements are to be brought forward from the doctrine of\r\nmechanics; after that the fabrication, proving, and action of gunpowder\r\nare to be introduced; and finally, the construction, fabrication, and\r\nexamination of cannon, carriages, and ammunition of the artillery and of\r\nsmall-arms.\r\n\r\nOf course the details of powder-mills, of cannon foundries, of artillery\r\nworkshops, of laboratories and small-arms manufactories, are here to be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nThe action of projectiles and the mode of applying it, are to be\r\nscientifically explained, by the aid of the parabolic and projectile\r\ntheory, as well as the principles upon which artillery experiments are\r\nto be conducted.\r\n\r\nFinally, the principles of the management of the artillery material in\r\nthe artillery dépôts are to be explained.\r\n\r\n4. The course of instruction will be closed by an historical description\r\nof the progress of artillery, and by an historical review of its\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nD. GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE TIME.\r\n\r\nThe total number of hours is, according to the constitution of the\r\nschool--\r\n\r\n  For the first cœtus, 35 weeks of 4 hours = 140 hours.\r\n      “   second    “     35   “      3   “   = 105   “\r\n      “   third     “     35   “      8   “   = 280   “\r\n\r\nThe exact number of hours dedicated to each division must be stated by\r\nthe teacher in the first instance in his special plan for lessons, as\r\nthey in part depend upon his general experience. But, at all events, all\r\nthe above-stated subjects for the first cœtus must be taught in the\r\nprescribed periods.\r\n\r\nThe lecture in the first cœtus must by no means be a mere mechanical\r\npreparation for the _Officer’s examination_; even here the understanding\r\nof the pupil is not to remain unoccupied, though the memory is to be had\r\nrecourse to in a very high degree, and the historical form, that is,\r\ndescription of objects as they are, predominates.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the arrangements can only be taken up in their chief\r\nfeatures, (partly because) time will not allow a farther advance, and\r\npartly because the progress of the students in the other studies is not\r\nyet sufficiently forward.\r\n\r\nIn the second cœtus the advantage has been obtained that the students\r\nhave gained a knowledge of the entire material of artillery in its\r\nvarious relations, and the lecture gives, therefore, an introduction to\r\nthe use of artillery in the field and in sieges; and with special regard\r\nto a fundamental knowledge of the details, and with the view to what is\r\nnecessary to complete the Engineer pupil and make an efficient\r\npreparation of the Artillerist for the third cœtus, aims at a somewhat\r\nmore scientific treatment, without going into the full comprehensive\r\ndetails reserved for the latter student. For the same reason, this\r\nportion of the lectures is confined nearly throughout to the explanation\r\nof existing conditions of our artillery, and only where the necessities\r\nof the Engineer student may demand it, can mention be made of the\r\nearlier material, or of the most important matters of foreign\r\nartilleries.\r\n\r\nThe instruction, therefore, of the first and second cœtus is directed\r\nmore to the general and historical, that of the third cœtus, more to the\r\nspecial and scientific culture of the student; the materials were there\r\ncollected which are here to be worked up.\r\n\r\nFrom this general point of view proceed also the methods which are to be\r\nobserved by the teachers in each cœtus.\r\n\r\nThe principal point to be kept hold of in all three cœtus is, that\r\neverything that can be shown the students, or which they can learn by\r\ntheir own manipulation, should be brought visibly before them, and as\r\nfar as time and circumstances permit, should be actually put in\r\npractice. The material objects, in their actual state for use, must as\r\noften as possible be shown and explained, for which the Practical\r\nExercises offer the best opportunity to which reference is here\r\ntherefore made.\r\n\r\nAfter these, a collection of models, diagrams, tables, and literary\r\nnotices are necessary, which may be partly used for immediate\r\ninstruction in the class, and partly furnished the pupils as a necessary\r\nand time-saving aid to the memory.\r\n\r\nDeficiencies in these aids to the lectures are to be laid before the\r\nDirection and Board of Studies by the teacher, and supplied as far as\r\nthe existing means allow.\r\n\r\nThose cases in which the proceedings are fixed by certain regulations\r\nrequire special mention; for instance, the transport of powder,\r\nexamination of cannon, drills, harnessing of horses, stable and camp\r\nservice, &c.\r\n\r\nAll these regulations are grounded on certain principles, from which no\r\ndeviation can take place without evil. The method of drawing them up is,\r\nhowever, variable, on which times and circumstances, and even the views\r\nof the superior authorities, have influence.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, highly necessary that in this respect the essential be\r\ncarefully in the instruction separated from the accidental, and by\r\nomitting the latter, not only gain time, but hinder that the students\r\naccustom themselves in a slovenly manner to look only to forms, and to\r\nseek in them the true being and life of artillery.\r\n\r\nA true exposition of the principles on which these regulations rest\r\nought not to be omitted from the lectures. They will suffice to prepare\r\nthe students to act correctly in every case that occurs, for which\r\nactual service gives them, moreover, the separate instruction. The more\r\ncompletely the teacher keeps this point in view the less need he fear to\r\nform his pupils to immature critics, since the well-informed officer\r\nwill more easily enter into the spirit of each such regulation, and more\r\nexactly carry it into execution for the benefit of the service, than he\r\nwho has been accustomed to keep without reflection only to the dead\r\nletter; this, in the varied phases of practical life, will often enough\r\nleave him without guidance, unless he knows how to find it within\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAs amongst the many existing class and hand-books for the artillery,\r\nnone is entirely adapted to form a basis for the lectures, the formation\r\nof a special plan of lectures for each cœtus is indispensable, that the\r\nlecturer may have a defined path, and the students an assistance in\r\ntheir repetitions.\r\n\r\nII. GENERAL AND SPECIAL ENGINEERING IN THE FIRST AND SECOND CŒTUS\r\n\r\nThe lecture commences with the first principles of fortification,\r\nsupposes no previous knowledge, and comprises--\r\n\r\n  (_a._) Field fortification, attack and defense of a redoubt,\r\ncommunication in the field, and,\r\n\r\n  (_b._) Permanent fortification, the art of besieging, with the example\r\nof a siege that has actually taken place.\r\n\r\nIn the first cœtus it must be so far carried out that the pupil is\r\ncapable of passing his _Officer’s examination_ according to the\r\nregulation of the 26th March, 1846. In the second cœtus the general\r\nknowledge of field and permanent fortification acquired in the first is\r\ncarried on in such a degree as both Artillery and Engineer officers\r\nrequire to form a good foundation for the particular professional study\r\nof both arms in the third cœtus.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of the special plan of the lecture the\r\ninstruction-regulations for artillery and exclusive engineering in the\r\nthird cœtus are to be kept in view, so as to prepare for these subjects\r\nby the nature and the method of the instruction.\r\n\r\nThe principal contents of the lecture are--\r\n\r\nA. IN THE FIRST CŒTUS.\r\n\r\na. _In Field Fortification._\r\n\r\nA correct description of the profile, the ground plan, the technical\r\nobstacles and modes of strengthening, the construction, and elementarily\r\nalso, the use of field-works; attack and defense of a redoubt, and the\r\nmilitary communications in the field, as roads, fords, and bridges.\r\n\r\nb. _In Permanent Fortification._\r\n\r\nExposition of the essential principles for plan and profile;\r\nacquaintance with the parts of a bastioned fortress with the outworks;\r\nspecial acquaintance with a work on Vauban’s first system, and its\r\nimprovements by Cormontaigne. Knowledge of the characteristics of the\r\nItalian, Dutch, and French fortification, of the ideas of Rimpler and\r\nMontalembert, as well as of the latest fortifications in Prussia;\r\nlastly, a knowledge of sieges as regards a regular attack and defense.\r\nThe art of construction is taught to the Engineers in the third cœtus.\r\n\r\nB. IN THE SECOND CŒTUS.\r\n\r\nApplied art of fortification, and, namely, attack and defense of the\r\nvarious sorts of field-works, castrametation, permanent fortification,\r\nprovisional fortification, and sieges. At their proper places, are to be\r\nintroduced the precepts of military constructions which are suitable\r\nalike to the Artillerist and the Engineer, as well as the conduct of\r\ninfantry and cavalry, and the duty of the Engineers in sieges.\r\n\r\n_Distribution of Time._\r\n\r\nThe first cœtus receives four, the second three hours weekly; therefore,\r\nin thirty-five weeks, the first 140, the second 105 hours. The number of\r\nhours which are to be dedicated to each portion will be indicated by the\r\nteacher in his special plan of the lectures, as it in part depends upon\r\nhis experiences. All the above-named subjects must, however, be gone\r\nthrough within the prescribed period.\r\n\r\nBefore every principal division of the lectures, a general statement of\r\nits purport and essential principles is given; then follows a short\r\nhistorical exposition which is to explain the connection, the\r\nemployment, and the thence arising conditions of the subject under\r\nconsideration in reference to the other parts of the art of war.\r\n\r\nThe precepts hence deducible on the form of the parts of a\r\nfortification, and on the subsisting relations of fighting, are to form\r\nthe latest and principal portion of each lecture.\r\n\r\nThe lecture is to be given in detail in such a manner, that its precepts\r\nmay be deduced from one another in a way suited to the powers of\r\nperception of the pupils, and their mental powers accustomed to the\r\ncarrying out of principles, rather than to a blind adherence to absolute\r\nregulations. To avoid repetition, the details of those doctrines which\r\nbelong to different places are to be given only once, namely, where they\r\nare first required; and afterwards reference only made to them.\r\n\r\nThe military element, as indispensable both for the Artillerist and\r\nEngineer alike, is to be kept continually in view.\r\n\r\nAs regards the principal divisions, oral repetitions may be made from\r\ntime to time for greater clearness; and, since individual and continued\r\nattention and self-reflection alone render a well-grounded progress in\r\nthe student possible, written themes, besides those prescribed, are\r\nparticularly recommended. It will not be necessary to submit each\r\nindividual essay to a separate correction, but the teacher may content\r\nhimself each time with giving a general view of important defects in the\r\ntreatment of the subject, and then reading aloud one or more of the\r\nessays that have best succeeded, and showing by their analysis how the\r\nsubject could be best treated.\r\n\r\nIn both cœtus, the existing models and full sized drawings in the\r\nschool, as also the models in the arsenal, and for the second cœtus more\r\nespecially the models of fortresses in the model-house, are to be used.\r\n\r\nThe means employed to complete the instruction in both cœtus, are\r\nfortification drawing, practical exercise in field-works, and an\r\ninspection of the fortress of Spandau.\r\n\r\nThe lectures are given without any fixed hand-book, from manuscript\r\ndrafts or notes.\r\n\r\nIII. EXCLUSIVE ENGINEERING IN THE THIRD CŒTUS.\r\n\r\nThe instruction in General Engineering in the first cœtus was intended\r\nto teach the Artillerist and Engineer so much of the art of\r\nfortification, of sieges, and of field-works as is requisite for\r\nofficers of every arm, and is necessary for the students to pass their\r\n_Officer’s examination_.\r\n\r\nIn the second cœtus this instruction was enlarged, and connected with\r\nits application to field and permanent fortification, to such extent as\r\nthe kindred arms of the artillery and engineer corps required equally to\r\nknow, that they may execute effectually their separate duties in\r\nfortification and sieges.\r\n\r\nThe instruction in Exclusive Engineering in the third cœtus is, however,\r\nintended solely for Engineers, as it teaches only professional matters\r\nwhich the engineer shares with no other arm of the service; while, on\r\nthe other hand, the Artillerist receives a special instruction in those\r\nbranches which are only necessary for the artillery officer.\r\n\r\nSince the lectures would receive a too great and heterogeneous\r\nextension, if to them were to be added that portion of hydraulics which\r\nthe engineer officer ought to know, without being immediately connected\r\nwith his military constructions, and if further, civil architecture\r\napplied to military buildings was touched on, these subjects will be\r\ntaught contemporaneously in the third cœtus by special instructors, and\r\nare therefore in the lectures on Exclusive Engineering not to pass the\r\nlimits of that instruction. Their respective teachers must receive\r\nreciprocally special information of each other’s plan of lectures, and\r\ngive mutual help by communications and inquiries where the studies might\r\ncome into collision.\r\n\r\nThe teacher of the Exclusive Engineer class must learn the extent of\r\nthose subjects of instruction which have been already treated in the\r\nlectures on Special Engineering in the second cœtus, and not only by\r\ninspection of the programme, but by personal consultation with their\r\nrespective teachers.\r\n\r\nIn more remote relation, the instruction connects itself with the\r\nearlier lectures on artillery, tactics, history of the art of war,\r\nmathematics, physics, chemistry, and the exercises in plan-drawing and\r\nsurveying. The special programmes of instruction of these branches of\r\nstudy are also to be taken notice of by the teacher, that nothing may be\r\ntwice taught, and that where the use of doctrines from those studies is\r\nnecessary, he may merely refer to them historically.\r\n\r\nThis instruction comprises, after an introduction, the following\r\nprincipal divisions.\r\n\r\n1. The application of the rules for sieges already given to particular\r\ncases, with a general regard to the ground, more especially of irregular\r\nfortresses, shown by various remarkable sieges.\r\n\r\n2. A theory of construction as auxiliary science in the execution of\r\nengineering works for field or permanent fortification, and in the\r\nexecution of military constructions: building materials, modes of\r\nbuilding, and the application of both for given purposes.\r\n\r\nTo this part belong--\r\n\r\n_a._ A knowledge of the different building materials from the animal,\r\nvegetable, and mineral kingdoms; their production and preparation for\r\nvarious building purposes, and the data, so important in practice,\r\nregarding their durability and mode of employment.\r\n\r\n_b._ The theory of the use and combination of these building materials\r\nfor constructive purposes, and of the building of separate portions of\r\nan edifice.\r\n\r\n_c._ The foundations of buildings and the means of improving the\r\nfoundation bottoms.\r\n\r\n_d._ Construction of ordinary buildings, as inclosures, inclined or\r\nunloaded revetments, loopholed walls, barracks and hospitals, dwelling\r\nand guard-houses, military prisons, stables, magazines, such as\r\narsenals, wagon sheds, provision stores, bakeries, powder magazines,\r\nlaboratories, communications, mines, weirs and stop-sluices,\r\nice-breakers, &c.\r\n\r\n_e._ Principles of machinery, with explanations of the forces necessary\r\nto move machines, with notice of the most common for raising and moving\r\nweights, for pumping, draining, dredging, &c.\r\n\r\n3. The art, to apply the knowledge gained by the foregoing lectures by\r\nmeans of projects for certain special purposes, and under given\r\ncircumstances of ground, such as his service may require of an\r\nEngineer Officer. The application of field fortification to given\r\nportions of ground is alone excepted, since the teacher of applied\r\nFortification-drawing has this especially assigned to him, who still is\r\nonly to give out his projects in unison with the teacher of Exclusive\r\nEngineering.\r\n\r\nThere belongs to this part--\r\n\r\n_a._ The method of preparing plans and estimates of buildings, in the\r\nmanner treated of under 2, at (_c_) and (_d_,) illustrated by frequent\r\npractice in making out such plans.\r\n\r\n_b._ Practice in plans for special objects and given ground, which\r\nlatter is to be chosen in the neighborhood of the fortress of Spandau.\r\n\r\n_c._ Instructions generally conceived on the duties in a fortress of an\r\nOfficer of Engineers, and on the practice of building in Prussian\r\nfortresses.\r\n\r\n_d._ As appendix, notices on the formation and preservation of hedges,\r\nand plantations of shrubs and trees.\r\n\r\nThe time fixed for this instruction amounts in thirty-five weeks, at ten\r\nhours each, to 350 hours, which, according to the importance of the\r\ndifferent sections, may, as a general rule, be appropriated as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  Introduction and details of the first\r\n    principal section,                                 about  20 hours.\r\n  Theory of building, namely; the lectures on materials\r\n    and their use,                                           140   “\r\n  Lectures on constructions,                                  80   “\r\n  Lectures on machinery,                                      30   “\r\n  Details of the third principal section,                     80   “\r\n                                                             ---\r\n    Total,                                                   350   “\r\n\r\nThe more particular distribution of this general division of time is\r\nmatter of the special lesson plan, and it only remains to be observed,\r\nthat with the approval of the Director, some afternoons are to be taken\r\nfor viewing the most remarkable buildings in Berlin and neighborhood;\r\nand in conjunction with the teacher of applied Fortification-drawing,\r\nthree days are to be set apart for a recognizance of the works of the\r\nfortress of Spandau, relative to the projects of fortifications\r\nmentioned under 3 at (_b._)\r\n\r\nThe two first sections of this instruction, namely, the continuation of\r\nthe instruction on sieges, and the theory of construction, keep their\r\nplace in the regular lectures of the school, though naturally they have\r\nan immediate applicability to practical service, and the lectures\r\ntherefore ought to be made his own by the pupil by frequent exercises\r\nand detailed plans.\r\n\r\nThe projects for a given ground, on the contrary, must be worked out by\r\nthe pupils in conformity with the instruction given, as much as possible\r\nindependently, and as on service a young officer would do under the\r\nguidance of his superior. The drawings need not be entirely shaded, but\r\nmay be partially executed by lines only, but they must be distinct and\r\nclean. Here, as in Fortification-drawing, the prescriptions of the\r\nEngineer regulation of the 25th of April, 1820, are to be observed, a\r\ncopy of which is therefore always present in the drawing-room, that they\r\nmay be seen by each student. Attention is to be given also to the\r\ncorrectness of the scale, to correct coloring, entry on the drawing of\r\nthe date when done, and of the name as well as the rank of the student,\r\nas directed by the above regulation.\r\n\r\nIn the exercises all propositions for improvements which vary from the\r\nmode of practice now in use are excluded.\r\n\r\nThe teaching auxiliaries are the books and models of the school.\r\n\r\nIV. HYDRAULIC CONSTRUCTIONS IN THE THIRD CŒTUS.\r\n\r\nThe instruction in hydraulics is to comprehend:--\r\n\r\n1. Those general principles of hydraulic architecture which in the\r\nlectures on Exclusive Engineering in the third cœtus of the school could\r\nnot be specially explained without extending them too far, and therefore\r\nwere there taken for granted.\r\n\r\n2. Such hydraulic works, as do not immediately come within the scope of\r\nmilitary buildings, and therefore could not be included in a lecture on\r\nExclusive Engineering, but which on account of their connection with the\r\nprofession of an Engineer Officer in general, independently of military\r\nconstruction proper, ought to be known by him in their most important\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nSince in the instruction in engineering in the third cœtus,\r\nopportunities offer for projects of fortification, with application of\r\nthe theoretical principles given above (at 1,) the exercise problems for\r\nthe instruction in hydraulic architecture need only extend to those\r\nhydraulic works (at 2,) not referring to fortification.\r\n\r\nThe instruction is in immediate connection with the lectures on\r\nmathematics, physics, and exclusive engineering, the last of which will\r\nbe lectured on at the same time as hydraulics; the lectures on physics\r\nand that portion of mathematics which is here necessary, with the\r\nexception of hydraulics, have been already treated in the first cœtus.\r\nIn arranging the plan of the lectures, and in carrying it out, the plans\r\nfor those sciences must be considered, and conferences held with the\r\nteachers it may concern, to prevent the frequent repetition of the same\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe entire number of hours is seventy, two of which are given weekly,\r\nwhich, that they may fall in at the same time with the lectures on\r\nexclusive engineering, are thus distributed:--\r\n\r\n                                                                 Hours.\r\n  1. Introduction and laws of the motion of water in open channels\r\n     and pipes, wells, suction and forcing pumps, about              5\r\n  2. Motion of water in streams, hydrometrical measurements,         3\r\n  3. Regulation of streams by dams, cuttings, &c., explanation\r\n     of ice-floats, and of the means to prevent their destructive\r\n     power,                                                          5\r\n  4. Execution and construction of these works and of securing the\r\n     banks by dikes, packing, and weirs,                            14\r\n  5. Historical description of the works for internal navigation,\r\n     canals, sluices, towing-paths, &c.,                             4\r\n  6. Draining and irrigation works, inundations,                     4\r\n  7. Harbors, moles, sands, lighthouses, roadsteads, &c.,            6\r\n  8. The principles of foundations under water, with accompanying\r\n     notice of the usual pile and scoop machines,                   12\r\n  9. The general principles of bridge building; historical relation\r\n     of the most remarkable works executed of this kind,            17\r\n                                                                    --\r\n     Total,                                                         70\r\n\r\nTo make the lecture plainer, and to exercise the student in\r\ncomprehending existing hydraulic buildings, eight afternoons, at the\r\nchoice of the teacher, after a previous consultation with the director,\r\nare to be appropriated to the inspection and drawing of hydraulic\r\nconstructions, at Berlin, namely, the sluices and mills.\r\n\r\nAlthough this instruction embraces a large field in a very short period,\r\nit must not be extended over too many objects, but rather to be confined\r\nto what is indispensable to the practical use of the engineer; the\r\nmatter of these, however, to be treated fundamentally and thoroughly,\r\nand all superficiality be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe lectures are to be given from private notes, without any prescribed\r\nhand-book.\r\n\r\nV. TACTICS.\r\n\r\n_In the First Cœtus._\r\n\r\nThe Students of the first cœtus are to receive a thorough instruction in\r\nelementary tactics, and the employment of the different arms, both\r\nseparately and united. The object is not merely that they may pass the\r\n_Officer’s examination_, but that they may gain true general ideas on\r\nthese subjects, which ought not to be strange to a well-informed officer\r\nof any arm. A frequent illustration of the lectures delivered, by\r\nexamples and problems for actual ground, is particularly recommended.\r\n\r\nLectures on tactics are closely connected with those on artillery,\r\nfortification, rules of the service; and in certain respects the\r\nlectures on plan-drawing and veterinary art, as well as practical\r\nexercises in surveying.\r\n\r\nMore especially--\r\n\r\n_a._ In artillery: Construction of cannon, of small-arms and side-arms,\r\nchoice and training of horses for artillery service; organization of the\r\nartillery; regulation for the artillery on march and in camp; use of\r\nartillery in the field, as regards the specialties of its position,\r\nmovement, and mode of fighting. The use of artillery in general, in\r\nattack and defense, with the use of the reserve artillery in more\r\nimportant battles, in village skirmishes, passage of rivers and defiles,\r\nand field fortifications, belongs to the lectures on artillery, but only\r\nin the second cœtus; these subjects are therefore to be treated\r\nhistorically with tactics, as far as knowledge of them is required for\r\nthe _Officer’s examination_. As a general principle, however, all the\r\nrelations of detail in the constitution or the specialties of artillery\r\nare to be treated in the lectures on that science; in the tactics, on\r\nthe contrary, only the more general relations which concern all the arms\r\nof the service, and where the artillery acts in union with infantry and\r\ncavalry.\r\n\r\n_b._ In Fortification; the designing and construction of field-works and\r\nall means of obstruction. The manner in which ground in general, and the\r\ngiven position in particular, is to be used for the throwing up\r\nfield-works. Attack and defense of field-works. Complete exposition of\r\nthe art of sieges.\r\n\r\n_c._ Veterinary art. Natural history, physiology, and general\r\nnourishment of the horse.\r\n\r\n_d._ Plan-drawing and surveying. Everything that is to be said on the\r\ngeneral physical laws of the form of the earth’s surface, and specially\r\non a knowledge of topography and its representation.\r\n\r\n_e._ Rules of the service. A knowledge of military style. Discipline in\r\nall its various branches. The internal service on detachments, convoys,\r\nand separate commands, and some historical remarks on the provisioning\r\nof an army.\r\n\r\nThe lectures embrace the following principal sections:--\r\n\r\n1. Introduction. General ideas of war. War materials. Aim of war.\r\nConduct of war. Tactics and strategy. Army organization.\r\n\r\n2. Organization of the Prussian army. Raising and equipping the troops.\r\nFormation and strength. Replacing of men and materials. Supplies.\r\n\r\n3. Special ideas of tactics. Forming, changing position, and combat.\r\nClose and open fighting; distant and near fighting. Offensive and\r\ndefensive. The enemy. The ground. Characteristics of the different sorts\r\nof troops. A short sketch of the development of tactics up to their\r\npresent state.\r\n\r\n4. The proscribed tactics of the infantry, cavalry, and artillery\r\naccording to the Prussian regulations.\r\n\r\n5. Ideas on the combination of the three Arms and order of battle.\r\n\r\n6. Influence of ground on the use of troops. Classification of ground\r\nand cognizance of the individual objects on it.\r\n\r\n7. Occupation, attack, and defense of objects on the ground, as heights,\r\nvalleys, woods, river lines, farm-buildings, inhabited places, defiles,\r\nbridges, dykes.\r\n\r\n8. Security of troops on a march. Service of advanced posts.\r\nReconnaissances. Special duties for detachments, as escorting convoys in\r\nour own or enemy’s country; foraging, surprises, ambuscades, covering of\r\nworks in the field. In conclusion, some remarks on partizan warfare.\r\n\r\nThe total number of hours comprises, according to the regulation, in\r\nthirty-five weeks at four hours each, 140 hours, of which are to be\r\nemployed:--\r\n\r\n  For the first and second principal sections about      15 hours.\r\n     “    third               “             “            20   “\r\n     “    fourth              “             “            40   “\r\n     “    fifth and sixth     “             “            15   “\r\n     “    seventh             “             “            25   “\r\n     “    eighth              “             “            25   “\r\n                                                        ---\r\n                           Total,                       140   “\r\n\r\nThe lectures on tactics furnish the student with the positive knowledge\r\nthat is necessary as a general basis; but further care is particularly\r\ntaken that by the application of the problems put before the students\r\ntheir knowledge is not made up of mere dead knowledge, but that\r\nthroughout their understandings are exercised. It is, therefore, a\r\nspecial duty of the teacher to frame his lectures accordingly, and as\r\nwell by a development of the basis upon which the organization, the\r\nelementary tactics, and the art of war is founded, as also by very\r\nfrequent exercises given to the pupils on the lectures to press towards\r\nthis end.\r\n\r\nFor the solution of the tactical problems, a number of plans of ground\r\nis necessary. They are obtained on the requisition of the teacher\r\nthrough the Director.\r\n\r\nIt is further necessary to illustrate the use of the different troops\r\nupon the ground itself, as well for attack as defense, and to have the\r\nexamples and problems given by the teachers sketched by the scholars.\r\nFor such exercises four days of two or three hours each will suffice.\r\n\r\nOf the existing hand-books, none appears perfectly qualified to serve as\r\na basis for instruction. The filling in, therefore, of a sketch of the\r\nlectures, and of a special plan of instruction, is indispensable to give\r\nthe teacher a fixed basis, and the scholars an assistance in their\r\nrepetitions.\r\n\r\nVI. MATHEMATICS.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical lecture, besides its general tendency to sharpen the\r\nintellect, is to make the scholars acquainted with all those theories\r\nand laws which are indispensable to the Artillery and Engineer officer\r\nto enable him to solve with certainty and ease those problems which so\r\noften meet him in the service.\r\n\r\nSince these problems in part require the application of rules of the\r\nhigher branches of mathematics, lectures on these ought not to be\r\nwanting, and consequently the mathematical instruction for at least a\r\nportion of the pupils must embrace (with few exceptions) the entire\r\nfield of this science.\r\n\r\nIn order, however, that this demand be accommodated to the time at\r\ndisposal and the capabilities of the students, the following rules are\r\nto be observed:--\r\n\r\n1. The students of the first cœtus having already passed their\r\nexamination for _Portépée ensign_, and the Predicate _ziemlich gut_, in\r\ntheir mathematical examination, being requisite for entry into the\r\nSchool, it is to be presumed that they enter with a good or at least\r\nsufficient preparatory knowledge. Still, as it is not to be expected\r\nthat the necessary requirement in arithmetic and algebra will be\r\npossessed throughout, the first part of the instruction must be\r\nconsidered as the most important, and be given thoroughly and\r\nfundamentally.\r\n\r\n2. Such portions of mathematics as are less necessary for Artillerists\r\nand Engineers (for instance, astronomy and the higher geodesy,) are to\r\nbe entirely omitted from the lectures.\r\n\r\n3. As even in such portions as fall within the scope of the lectures,\r\nthere is much that can not be exhausted, therefore all that belongs\r\nsolely to speculative views, or possibly only serves to the rounding or\r\nperfecting a system, must be passed over. The instruction in mathematics\r\nstands in near and frequent connection with the lectures on artillery,\r\narchitecture, mechanics, physics, theory of surveying, and with drawing\r\nlessons, as well as with practical mensuration.\r\n\r\nThese belong specially--\r\n\r\n_a._ To Artillery: architecture, mechanics; the application of all those\r\nformulas which the mathematical lectures have to deduce and to prove.\r\n\r\n_b._ To Physics: the theories of dioptrics, and catoptrics, which the\r\nstudents require to a perfect understanding of the construction of\r\ntelescopes and reflecting instruments; what is necessary from aerometry\r\nand aerostatics.\r\n\r\n_c._ To Drawing lessons: practical working out of the theory of\r\nperspection, and the construction of shadows.\r\n\r\n_d._ To the theory of Surveying: a knowledge of all the instruments\r\nrequisite for mensuration and leveling, and the principal theorems, with\r\ntheir application to cases occurring in mensuration.\r\n\r\nThe lectures on mathematics form of themselves a continuous, closely\r\nconnected whole; consequently, the same teacher who gave instruction in\r\nthe first cœtus is to retain his pupils in the second, so that each of\r\nthe two teachers commence with the first cœtus in alternate years.\r\n\r\nFor the third cœtus there will be a selection made of those students who\r\nhave made themselves noticed in the second cœtus by distinguished\r\nability, special application, and peculiar talent for the study of\r\nmathematics, and have thus raised hopes that they may be conducted with\r\nsuccess into the higher branches of the science.\r\n\r\nThey form a separate division, whose number should always be small if\r\nthe selection be guided strictly by the contemplated purpose. All the\r\nother students of the third cœtus form a second division, in which the\r\nentire field of what they have already been taught in mathematics is\r\nagain gone over, with a view to its application; and at the end of this\r\ncourse some other subjects necessary to the Artillerist and Engineer are\r\nto be treated, without, however, mere scientific speculations.\r\n\r\nFor each of these divisions a separate teacher is appointed.\r\n\r\nA. THE LECTURES IN THE FIRST CŒTUS EMBRACE,--\r\n\r\nI. _Arithmetic and Algebra._\r\n\r\n1. Algebra, with sums, differences, products, quotients, whole numbers,\r\nroots, powers with real exponents and logarithms.

(4½ months.)\r\n\r\nC. THE LECTURES IN THE FIRST SECTION OF THE THIRD CŒTUS COMPRISE,\r\n\r\n1. Differential and integral calculation. (3 months.)\r\n\r\n2. Higher geometry. (2½ months.)\r\n\r\n3. Dynamics (mechanical,) and hydraulics, with application of the\r\ndetermination of the strength, direction, and distribution of the recoil\r\nupon the separate proportions of a piece of ordnance, of the science of\r\nprojectiles, of the theory of carriages, of the rise of rockets. (3½\r\nmonths.)\r\n\r\nD. THE LECTURES IN THE SECOND DIVISION OF THE THIRD CŒTUS COMPRISE,\r\n\r\n1. Repetition of the most important results of the instruction in the\r\nfirst cœtus in a series of exercises.\r\n\r\n2. Repetition of the theory of statics and solution of numerous problems\r\nfrom real life. (3 months.)\r\n\r\n3. Dynamics and hydraulics without higher analysis, with applications.\r\n(3 months.)\r\n\r\nE. GENERAL APPROPRIATION OF TIME.\r\n\r\nThe number of lessons (hours) amounts, according to the prescribed plan\r\nfor the first and second cœtus, to six hours, for each division of the\r\nthird cœtus four hours, weekly; if the course be taken, after deducting\r\nthe holidays and other interruptions, at thirty-five weeks, then there\r\nwill be for the first and second cœtus, 210, and for each division of\r\nthe third, 140 hours.\r\n\r\nThe number of hours to be devoted to each portion must, in the first\r\ninstance, be determined by the teacher in his special lecture plan, as\r\nit in part depends upon his previous experience; at all events, all the\r\nabove-named themes for the first cœtus must be treated in the stated\r\ntime. Only in special cases, in the second and third cœtus, can the\r\nomission or transposition of one or the other, on reference to the\r\nhigher authorities, be permitted.\r\n\r\nIt has been already remarked that the course of mathematics should\r\nimpart to the students not only that amount of positive knowledge which\r\nhe requires for his immediate sphere of action and needs as incitement\r\nand guide to further study, but also should fill the important purpose\r\nof forming the mind of the students generally. This purpose will be the\r\nmore certainly gained the more the teacher is enabled to render the\r\nscholar self-trusting, and in each separate study to lead to the\r\ndevelopment of a few select principles simple and easily understood, but\r\ncomprising in natural and logical connection the whole theory, so that\r\nthe scholar fancies they are his own discovery, and therefore prizes\r\nthem as his own. The teacher must, therefore, gradually propose a series\r\nof connected inquiries, and those naturally first on which the usual\r\nsystems are based, as questions to which the students have to submit\r\nanswers deduced from the above-named principles, with constant\r\napplication of simple common sense. By these means the students are not\r\nonly continually gaining single results, made ready to their hand by\r\nuse, but what is principally desired, they acquire thereby great mental\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nAs regards instruction in the separate cœtus, the following rules are to\r\nbe observed:--\r\n\r\nAt the commencement in the first cœtus, the teacher should endeavor, by\r\nfrequent questions to form a full and correct judgment of the previous\r\nknowledge of each student, that he may determine how he should proceed\r\nwith his lecture, slower or quicker, and to what subjects generally for\r\nthe entire class special notice and exercise should be devoted.\r\n\r\nThe most complete exercise of the elementary rules, forming, as it does,\r\nthe indispensable basis for all future progress is in this cœtus the\r\nprincipal aim of the teacher.\r\n\r\nIn the second cœtus, in the application of the theory of co-ordinates to\r\nthe commonest curves, no investigation of the specialties of the theory\r\nof curves is necessary, because this is reserved for later lectures, and\r\nit would here abridge the time required for subjects of nearer interest.\r\nThe development of these theories must, therefore, be confined to the\r\nsimplest elementary use. The study, too, of the analysis of finite\r\nnumbers is to be continued only so far as the student requires for\r\nimmediate application, without any intention of going deeper into the\r\nscience. On the other hand, a suitably increased time is to be given to\r\nstatics and hydrostatics, because the student ought to be acquainted\r\nwith them in the most complete manner.\r\n\r\nAs the first division of the third cœtus consists of but few and only\r\nthe best scholars, it may be required of them to work out independently\r\nat home separate questions given by the teacher, and submit them to him\r\nfor examination. The progress of the student is more surely gained and\r\nadvanced, the oftener he has opportunity of personally discovering\r\nmathematical truths, or by applying them to examples to come to a\r\nclearer comprehension and use of them.\r\n\r\nIn the second division the teacher will not always be able to avoid\r\ngiving a repetition of the reasons of propositions. This is necessary\r\nwhen he perceives from the work or expressions of the students, that the\r\nmajority have not perfectly comprehended the proposition. Still the\r\nteacher will here content himself with bringing forward the most\r\nimportant points in the chain of deduction. The explanatory problems are\r\nsolved by the teacher himself, who then sets similar ones for working\r\nout by the students at home.\r\n\r\nFor practical static problems, the teacher can use with great benefit\r\nobjects often occurring in common life, and yet regarded so little; the\r\nnumerous applications of the lever, of the inclined plane, &c., by\r\nartillerists and engineers, for their works, carriages, draught, &c.,\r\nfurnish sufficient material for such problems; as for instance,\r\ndetermination of the depth of a boat of given length and breadth when\r\nafter putting into it a piece of ordnance a given height out of water is\r\nrequired; determination of the power requisite to overcome the\r\nresistance of a log lying in the track of a vessel; determination of the\r\npressure of a laden beam on two or more supports with reference to the\r\nflexibility of the beam; determination of the center of gravity in an\r\nexcentric hollow shot, both theoretically with given radius and known\r\ncenters, as well as more practically when the centers and the radius of\r\nits interior are unknown, as by dipping the hollow shot into\r\nquicksilver; determination of the counterpoise of a drawbridge and\r\nexamination of the best position for the axle ; investigation of the\r\nstrength of metal and wood pipes which are to serve as water-pipes at\r\ngiven heights of pressure, &c.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the teacher ought not to leave unnoticed the advantages\r\nwhich theory can offer to practice when rightly applied, by which is in\r\nno way meant that the practical man should enter every time into a\r\nprolix and anxious calculation, but from the improvement his mind and\r\ncapacities have received, he may apply readily what he has learnt to the\r\npurposes of common life.\r\n\r\nDynamics and hydraulics will be rather treated in a physical and\r\nhistorical point of view; here, too, the application of known\r\nprofessional results is the principal object.\r\n\r\nAs the limited time will not allow separate mathematical repetitions,\r\nthe teacher should therefore be the more careful to make his lectures as\r\nmuch as possible applicatory. To insure progress the students must,\r\nbesides the usual writing out the lecture, have frequent themes given to\r\nthem for work at home, and of which their own execution should be\r\nsecured by proper means.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly necessary that a hand-book should form the basis of the\r\ninstruction, from which the teacher should lecture, and the students\r\nmake repetitions.\r\n\r\nThe hand-books are to be proposed by the teacher to the Board of\r\nStudies, and must not be changed without permission.\r\n\r\nThese books, as well as the logarithm tables, every student must have a\r\ncopy of, as he can not do without them in the school, and may frequently\r\nrequire them in future life.\r\n\r\nModels of solids, to illustrate the projection theory, are in the\r\ncollection of the models of the school.\r\n\r\nVII. PRACTICAL ARTILLERY EXERCISES.\r\n\r\nThe practical artillery exercises are intended, in the first place, to\r\nfurnish the students with a sight of that portion of the material of the\r\nartillery which they have had no previous opportunity of knowing, and of\r\nwhich the knowledge is indispensable for a complete understanding of the\r\ntheoretical lecture. The exercises should follow the lecture as\r\nimmediately as possible, and occur therefore during the continuance of\r\nthe theoretical course.\r\n\r\nThe students are besides to become acquainted with the methods of\r\nexecution of the most important artillery duties, in an extent\r\ncompatible with their position, and the time at their disposition. For\r\nthis portion of the exercises, the months of July, August and September\r\nare to be preferred.\r\n\r\nIn the major part of these exercises, the engineer students take part so\r\nas to gain a knowledge of such parts of the artillery service as seem to\r\nbe of the greatest importance to them.\r\n\r\nThe artillery exercises separate into numerous subdivisions, of which\r\nthe following may be particularly remarked:--\r\n\r\nI. EXERCISES OF THE FIRST COETUS.\r\n\r\nA. _Visits._\r\n\r\nThe visits happen, as already noted, at the period of the theoretical\r\ninstruction. The students are to be divided into as many sections as is\r\nnecessary, that each may gain the desired information. There belong to\r\nthis part--\r\n\r\n_a._ Visiting the foundry and the boring machine. All the students of\r\nthe first coetus are to be taken by the artillery teacher of this\r\ncoetus, on two afternoons, to the foundry, and to the new boring\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThey will see the general construction of the foundry and the boring\r\nmachine, and, in case such work is going on, the molding, boring, and\r\nturning, and receive the explanations necessary.\r\n\r\n_b._ Examination of ordnance, gun-carriages, and ammunition wagons.\r\n\r\nThose in the arsenal, as well as the exercising pieces of the regiment\r\nof artillery of the guard, are to be used for this purpose, to exhibit\r\nthe construction of ordnance both in the Prussian and foreign\r\nartilleries, and also those of an earlier date, from the specimens kept\r\nthere. In the same way as has been remarked for the ordnance, the\r\ngun-carriages and equipages of the guard artillery regiment in store\r\nwill offer opportunity for a more exact scrutiny of these carriages,\r\nlimbers, and wagons. For these visits four afternoons are to be taken.\r\n\r\n_c._ Visit to the workshops of the artillery:--\r\n\r\nThe students will, in two afternoons, gain there a knowledge of the\r\nfollowing objects:\r\n\r\n1. The mode of work in general.\r\n\r\n2. Processes in the manufacture of the most important objects of\r\nartillery material, as axles, wheels, carriages, mountings, sponges,\r\nharness, ropes, &c.\r\n\r\n3. The raw material (wood, iron, leather.)\r\n\r\n4. Objects furnished to field, siege, and fortress artillery.\r\n\r\n_d._ Visit to the small-arms factory and powder-mills in Spandau:--\r\n\r\nThe scholars of the first coetus will be conducted into both\r\nmanufactories, to obtain a general insight into the various works.\r\n\r\nIn order that the work of the manufactories may receive no interruption,\r\nthe teacher of the first coetus is to communicate beforehand with their\r\nrespective superintendents, and take the students in suitable small\r\nparties, and before entering the powder manufactory to insist, most\r\ncarefully, on all the proper precautions being observed.\r\n\r\nThese visits are to take place during the theoretical course on the same\r\nday as is fixed for the first coetus to visit the fortress of Spandau to\r\nstudy its fortifications; and, therefore, an agreement should be made\r\nbetween the teacher of artillery and the teacher of general engineering.\r\n\r\n_e._ Visit to the armory at the arsenal:--\r\n\r\nThe students are to be conducted on an afternoon to the armory of the\r\narsenal, where the superintendent will explain to them the peculiarities\r\nof match and wheel locks, with the most remarkable projects for loading\r\nat the breech, and with the form of small arms amongst other nations.\r\n\r\nB. _Exercises._\r\n\r\n_a._ Examination of small arms:--\r\n\r\nThe students are to be taken by their teacher to the musket manufactory,\r\nwhere they will be shown the mode of proof of small arms in general, and\r\nwith reference to the theoretical lecture then in progress.\r\n\r\nEach student then receives a faulty musket, with direction to examine\r\nand note its defects. The teacher revises and corrects these notes.\r\n\r\n_b._ The management of machines:\r\n\r\nIn the presence of the students the management of various machines, &c.,\r\nas well as the repair of damaged carriages, will be undertaken.\r\nAccording to the means at disposal, such exercises will be selected as\r\nare most instructive, in exhibiting arrangement, strength, and care in\r\ntheir application.\r\n\r\nThe students will be permitted to lend a hand only in such cases as it\r\nis foreseen that their strength will be sufficient. For all other\r\npurposes where strength is necessary, workmen must be employed.\r\n\r\nII. EXERCISES IN THE SECOND CŒTUS.\r\n\r\nWhen the teacher judges proper, some of the previous visits are repeated\r\non the afternoons disposable during the theoretical course.\r\n\r\nA. _Marking out and Tracing Batteries._\r\n\r\nThe students undertake these exercises under inspection of their teacher\r\nof artillery on two days in the last three months of the course.\r\n\r\nThe teacher instructs them then how to ascertain the prolongation of the\r\nenemy’s lines, and the mode of determining the line of fire of the first\r\nembrasure of the different batteries, as well as the other points to be\r\nmarked out, both with the use of the usual instruments, and with simple\r\nmeasurement by pacing, and laying down right angles by the eye.\r\n\r\nA complete construction of a battery is not possible on account of the\r\nshortness of time, paucity of means, and strength of the students. The\r\nexercise, therefore, is confined to an explanation of the formation of\r\nthe material and tool depots; to marking out and tracing horizontal and\r\nsunk batteries on even, irregular, and sloping ground, and to the\r\nconstruction of the powder magazine.\r\n\r\nB. _Practical Exemplification of the Rules for Placing Ordnance\r\naccording to the Ground._\r\n\r\nThese exercises are to be carried out on two afternoons by all the\r\nstudents, under the inspection of their artillery teacher.\r\n\r\nThey have only reference to the ground, and leave out of consideration\r\nall tactical considerations. This object may be fully attained even\r\nwithout guns, and the necessary instruction may be given without them,\r\nas it would not be easy to form all the batteries in the desired number.\r\n\r\nThe teacher chooses the ground, explains it by means of a plan to the\r\nstudents, and goes with them to the place. He divides them into various\r\nsections, and lets each select positions for from two to eight pieces,\r\nboth for attack and defence with different kinds of ordnance, giving\r\nonly generally the direction and distance at which the enemy is\r\noperating.\r\n\r\nEach position is inspected by the teacher, and the views and reasons for\r\nit received and discussed as regards effect, mode of firing, and\r\ncovering and free movement, and where it is necessary, improved; and at\r\nthe same time the requisite precautions taken for the limbers and\r\nwagons.\r\n\r\nC. _Drawings of Ordnance Carriages and Wagons._\r\n\r\nThese exercises are to be undertaken by the artillerists of the second\r\ncœtus, under inspection of the teacher of artillery-drawing, on twelve\r\nafternoons in June.\r\n\r\nThe drawing of a piece of ordnance is to be clearly distinguished from\r\nthe examination of it. For the first, taking the necessary measures is\r\nalone necessary, but not their comparison with given models.\r\n\r\nThe teacher will order these exercises, so that the students learn\r\nprincipally--\r\n\r\n1. What scale they ought to take for a given object, so as to execute a\r\ndrawing with the precision necessary for being afterwards worked from.\r\n\r\n2. With what instruments and method of procedure they may most easily\r\nobtain their end.\r\n\r\n3. How notices of improvements are to be taken and arranged.\r\n\r\n4. How the rough draft is to be jotted down.\r\n\r\nIt must be here particularly remarked that our guns, carriages, &c.,\r\nhave no mathematically exact forms, and that therefore the number of\r\nmeasures to be taken must be often multiplied to have a true figure of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nA fair drawing from these measures in the above period is so much the\r\nless possible, as the number of objects is as much as possible\r\nmultiplied. It is fully sufficient, however, for the purpose of this\r\nexercise, that the students learn to take complete and useful rough\r\ndrafts.\r\n\r\nOn their entrance into the third cœtus, the complete drawings from these\r\nrough drafts take place.\r\n\r\nIn his selection of objects to be drawn, the teacher must, in having\r\nregard to variety, take care that the drawings by too great difficulty\r\ndo not exceed the time and power of the students, nor by too great\r\nsimplicity cease to be instructive.\r\n\r\nOrdnance carriages, limbers, wagons, and the machines required in\r\nartillery, are the most suitable for choice, and are easiest obtainable\r\nin the arsenal.\r\n\r\nThe students must be divided into sub-sections, of at most three or four\r\npersons, and to each a separate task given.\r\n\r\nThe teacher is to be present at the drawings to see to their proper\r\nexecution, and has delivered to him the notices and rough sketches to\r\namend any errors that may be in them.\r\n\r\nThe relative section of the second edition of Burg’s “_Drawing of\r\nArtillery Material_” is to be taken as the basis for these exercises. In\r\naddition to them, the students receive guidance and suitable instruction\r\nin drawing artillery objects off-hand by the eye, without the use of\r\ninstruments. The first two days are to be chosen for this, and the\r\nstudents by this use of off-hand drawing receive at the same time a\r\nuseful preparation for the drawings subsequently required to be taken by\r\nthe aid of instruments.\r\n\r\nD. _Exercises necessary in regard to Sieges_--\r\n\r\nAre to be conducted by the teacher of artillery and special engineering\r\njointly, and are given more in detail under _exercises in\r\nfortification_.\r\n\r\nIII. EXERCISES IN COMMON OF THE FIRST AND SECOND CŒTUS.\r\n\r\nA. _Proof of Powder._\r\n\r\nThis exercise is to be conducted by all the students of the first and\r\nsecond cœtus at the time of the gun-practice, and comprises--\r\n\r\n1. Firing different sorts of powder from the proof mortar.\r\n\r\n2. Firing different sorts of powder purposely brought into an abnormal\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n3. Instruction in weighing and measuring the powder.\r\n\r\nB. _Artillery Practice._\r\n\r\nAll the students of the second and third cœtus take part in the practice\r\nunder the inspection of the two teachers of artillery, for which\r\nfourteen days in August and September are fixed. If possible, it is to\r\nbe undertaken in the morning, and only when the practice-ground is\r\notherwise occupied is it to be deferred till the afternoons.\r\n\r\nThe practice comprises--\r\n\r\n1. The necessary preparation for firing; namely, laying down the\r\nplatform, marking the range, fixing the targets, preparing the lists to\r\nnote the shots.\r\n\r\n2. Firing from different kinds of ordnance and with different\r\nprojectiles.\r\n\r\n3. Instruction of the students in the service of the guns; selection of\r\nthe charge and direction under given circumstances, and their\r\ncorrection; effects of distance; noting and jotting down the shots and\r\nthe time of flight; calculation of the length of fuse, of ranges and\r\naverages from the different data, and remarks on the effects sought.\r\n\r\n4. Burning a portion of prepared laboratory materials for observation of\r\nits action and effect.\r\n\r\nThe following are to be objects of practice:--\r\n\r\n_a._ Rounds of six, twelve, and twenty-four lbs. shot and shell out of\r\nthe short 24-pounders, to note--\r\n\r\n_aa._ The grazes, distances, and deviations at different elevations, and\r\nas regards ricochet fire.\r\n\r\n_bb._ Probability of hitting upright targets at various distances.\r\n\r\n_cc._ As regards dismounting.\r\n\r\n_dd._ As regards firing against heads of saps.\r\n\r\n_b._ Seven, ten and twenty-five lb. shells, carcases, and light balls,\r\nto note--\r\n\r\n_aa._ The grazes, distances, and deviations at different elevations and\r\ncharges, also as regards ricochet firing.\r\n\r\n_bb._ The probability of hitting upright targets at various distances.\r\n\r\n_c._ Shells, carcases, and light balls from mortars, to note--\r\n\r\n_aa._ The probability of hitting upright targets at different distances.\r\n\r\n_bb._ The calculation of the charge or elevation when one of these\r\nelements and the distance are given, or _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n_cc._ Calculation of lengths of fuse for given distances.\r\n\r\n_d._ Throwing hand grenades, stones, 1-pound case shot, and 3-pound\r\nballs at various distances for comparison of the effects.\r\n\r\n_e._ Firing from the hand and stock-mortars at differing distances.\r\n\r\n_f._ Case shot from 6 or 12-pounders, also from short or long\r\n24-pounders and 7 and 50-pound howitzers at different distances against\r\nplanks, and both with case shot, and grape shot, for observing the\r\neffect:\r\n\r\n_aa._ Of different charges.\r\n\r\n_bb._ Of different weights of the entire case.\r\n\r\n_cc._ Of the weight and size of balls used.\r\n\r\n_dd._ There is also to be observed the scattering, the number of hits\r\nand wide balls, and determination of the best line.\r\n\r\n_g._ Shrapnel shells from field-pieces against planking.\r\n\r\n5. The number of the before-named rounds is not to be too great, partly\r\nnot to increase expense, partly in regard to time, since the practice is\r\nintended for instruction, and therefore not to be hurried. Still for\r\nshot, shell, and grape shot, ten rounds is the _minimum_, if a result is\r\nto be drawn; for the small mortar five rounds are sufficient.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this limit, it will not be possible to take the practice\r\nall in one year. It seems, therefore, expedient to divide the whole into\r\ntwo portions, so that the most important practice happens indeed in each\r\nyear, generally however, in one year the practice is to take place with\r\nfield-pieces, in the following year with siege-pieces, so that the\r\nstudent who is present once in the first year and once in the second can\r\ncomplete the necessary course.\r\n\r\nThe teachers have, therefore, to determine, in the proposed plans for\r\nthese exercises, the sort and number of rounds they judge necessary for\r\nthe following year.\r\n\r\nC. _Practice in the Laboratory._\r\n\r\nAs the students of the artillery, by the present regulations of their\r\neducation in the regiments, have not sufficient opportunity to learn the\r\nservice of the laboratory perfectly, particular attention must be paid\r\nto this work in the school.\r\n\r\nThe students of the engineer corps also take part in it, in the second\r\ncœtus, not to become perfect proficients in the different operations,\r\nbut so as to gain a general knowledge of ammunition, matches, and\r\ncompositions, and the duties of the laboratory.\r\n\r\nAll the students of the first, and the artillery students of the second\r\ncœtus are therefore to be occupied by their teachers for twelve\r\nafternoons in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nFor the superintendence, so necessary in these works, and for variety of\r\npractice, the fireworkers employed as assistant teachers in the school,\r\nand others from the proof department of the artillery, and also five or\r\nsix artillery officers of the third cœtus, are to be present at this\r\npractice, so that each of these students is present twice or thrice on\r\nthe average.\r\n\r\nThe work embraces, first, the preparation of ammunition for the\r\nartillery practice, &c.\r\n\r\nBut as this would not suffice for the complete instruction of such a\r\nlarge number of students, it must receive an extension calculated for\r\nthis purpose, and embrace not only the separate preparations, but also a\r\nlarge quantity of ammunition, which, as not required for the school, is\r\ntherefore sent to the depót.\r\n\r\nThe following work is to be preferred:--\r\n\r\nPounding of saltpetre, grinding meal powder, pounding sulphur and\r\ncharcoal, boiling paste, making mastic, composition, quick-match, fuses,\r\ntubes, port-fires, carcass composition, touchpaper, case and grape shot,\r\nloading shells for bursting, discharging empty shells in which a fuse\r\nonly has been driven; carcasses, fire-balls, and light balls; infantry,\r\ncavalry, buck-shot, and percussion cartridges; ball, canister, howitzer,\r\nand paper cartridges. Fanal, signal rockets, pitch compounds, powder\r\nbags, and stink-pots. The teacher is to make a careful distribution of\r\nthe students, (allowing for such as have missed any days by illness,) to\r\nbe satisfied that each artillerist has made every article in the\r\nlaboratory, if possible, or at least has carefully witnessed its\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nIV. EXERCISES IN THE THIRD CŒTUS.\r\n\r\nAll the exercises of this cœtus take place during the period of the\r\ntheoretical course.\r\n\r\nA. _Visit to the Workshops._\r\n\r\nThe student will have to learn the mode of proceeding, the construction,\r\nand the use of the machines employed. Examination and storing of the\r\nmost important raw materials.\r\n\r\nB. _Visit to the Iron Foundry._\r\n\r\nAll the students of the third cœtus are to be divided into two sections,\r\nand each section to be conducted on an afternoon under the care of the\r\nteacher of artillery concerned to the Royal Iron Foundry.\r\n\r\nThey will see there the molding, casting, and cleaning of case shot,\r\ncannon balls, and shells.\r\n\r\nThey will also have explained to them the construction of reverberatory\r\nand cupola furnaces, of steam engines, and of turning lathes, and\r\nplaning benches.\r\n\r\nC. _Visit to the Foundry and Boring Machine._\r\n\r\nThe students of the third cœtus are to be present at the actual\r\nmanufacture of cannon, their molding, casting, and boring. But as the\r\ncircumscribed room and other considerations will not allow all the\r\nstudents to be present at one time, different divisions are to be\r\nformed, to visit the foundry and boring house on different days. The\r\nteacher concerned, will, therefore, make the necessary inquiries as to\r\nthe time when the above works are going on, and arrange the visits by\r\ncommunication with the director.\r\n\r\nThe casting and preparation of iron ordnance require particular\r\nattention. On this, too, the teacher has to obtain information, and\r\nproceed as above.\r\n\r\nD. _Examination of Iron Ammunition._\r\n\r\nThe artillery officers of the third cœtus take these exercises in hand\r\non two afternoons, under care of the artillery teacher in the same\r\ncœtus.\r\n\r\nThe purport of it is not so much a thorough instruction in this\r\nmanufacture, as a completion of the theoretical lectures on the mode of\r\nconducting the processes by means of personal inspection and handling of\r\nthe instruments. The teacher will pay particular attention to the errors\r\nthat may occur in the measurements, &c.\r\n\r\nE. _Examination of Cannon._\r\n\r\nThis exercise is to be undertaken by the artillery officers of the third\r\ncœtus, under the inspection of their artillery teacher, in six\r\nafternoons. The object of it is exactly the same as of the foregoing.\r\n\r\nThe exercise must commence with directions for proving the instruments,\r\nwhen the teacher will show the mode of their manipulation.\r\n\r\nAs the use of such instruments only can be reckoned on as the school,\r\nthe depôt, and the artillery proof department possess, only three\r\nsections of the students can work each day simultaneously; the section\r\nconsisting, at the utmost, of six persons, if individual handling of\r\nthem is presumed necessary.\r\n\r\nThe teacher must, therefore, divide the students into sub-sections, and\r\nmake such arrangement that each student, if possible, personally work\r\nevery part of the exercise, or at least have a perfect sight of it.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the students which can not be immediately occupied on\r\neach exercise day, put their tables of dimensions in the order and forms\r\nrequired by the regulations.\r\n\r\nF. _Examination of the Gun-Carriages and Wagons._\r\n\r\nThe exercise is to be conducted by the artillery officers of the third\r\ncœtus, exactly as the foregoing, in five afternoons.\r\n\r\nG. _Practical Exposition of the Rules for the placing of Guns according\r\nto given Tactical Relations._\r\n\r\nThese exercises are to be performed by the artillery students of the\r\nthird cœtus, under the direction of their teacher of artillery, on four\r\nafternoons.\r\n\r\nThe teacher makes known the ground by means of a plan; he then directs\r\nreconnaissances to be made, and receives the reports.\r\n\r\nHe selects a tactical problem, the nature of which offers opportunity to\r\nremark both on the placing of guns of different calibres, and also the\r\nreserve artillery at the decisive moment of a battle, as well as the\r\nmore minute details of placing single divisions and guns, and the\r\nlimbers, riding horses, and wagons.\r\n\r\nBefore he solves himself the problem completely, he gathers the opinions\r\nof the students in respect to single portions, and if necessary sets\r\nthem right.\r\n\r\nThe principles to be followed refer so specially to the ground, that the\r\nobject of illustrating the instructions can be attained without guns.\r\nThe teacher may therefore content himself with marking by flags the\r\nsituation of single guns and batteries, by which the advantage is\r\nobtained of an easier use of the ground.\r\n\r\nH. _Exercises at Spandau in reference to a Siege._\r\n\r\nThese exercises are to be conducted by the teacher of artillery, in\r\nunison with analogous regulations of the teacher of engineering, and are\r\nmore particularly mentioned in the practical exercises of fortification.\r\n\r\nThe limits of time and means render it impossible to gain for the\r\nabove-named exercises that extent by which the full acquirement of the\r\nnecessary mechanical readiness could be insured. It is sufficient if the\r\nstudent has made a perfect personal examination and performed as much\r\nmanipulation as circumstances permit.\r\n\r\nThe separate practical exercises can only be made after the termination\r\nof the theoretical treatment of the subject. This rule is necessary,\r\npartly because this practice is only a continuance and completion of the\r\nlecture, partly because the shortness of time restricts the exercises\r\nconsiderably, and therefore the days devoted to them can not be applied\r\nto theoretical explanations, which will be more profitably given in the\r\nlectures.\r\n\r\nWhere the nature of the exercises permits, the officers and elder\r\n_portépée ensigns_ will take the superintendence, that having formerly\r\nlearnt the execution, they may now make themselves acquainted with the\r\nduties of ordering and inspection.\r\n\r\nThe number of students engaged at one time in an exercise ought not to\r\nbe so large that a portion of it remain unoccupied or not under the\r\ncomplete inspection of the teacher. The disturbances that occur too\r\neasily in such cases, being most injurious, must be most carefully\r\navoided. The teacher will make the division above stated, and take all\r\nnecessary measures for obtaining the requisite control.\r\n\r\nIf at any of the exercises, danger can arise to the students, the\r\nteacher is previously to instruct them specially in what is to be\r\nobserved for the safety of the workmen; after that, the superintendence\r\nof the students must be conducted with increased care, and any departure\r\nfrom the given orders visited with redoubled severity.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the days for these exercises rests with the\r\ndirector, after consulting the teachers. Should unexpected hindrances\r\nprevent the carrying out an exercise, the teacher may determine\r\nconcerning it, but must consult with the Direction as to the fetching it\r\nup on another disposable day.\r\n\r\nThe necessary workmen will be demanded by the Direction from the\r\nrespective services, of which the teacher will give to the Direction due\r\nprevious notice.\r\n\r\nThe guns necessary for practice are to be lent by the Artillery Regiment\r\nof the Guard and the Artillery Depot; all the other instruments,\r\nequipments, &c., are borrowed from the Depot. All materials are received\r\nby order of the war department or by purchase. It is therefore the\r\nbusiness of the senior of the two Artillery teachers, in his yearly\r\ndemand for the practice, to state the full requirement of tools and\r\nmaterials, that the Direction may take timely measures for their supply.\r\n\r\nVIII. PRACTICAL EXERCISES IN FORTIFICATION.\r\n\r\nPractical exercises in fortification stand in immediate relation to the\r\nlectures on fortification, sieges, and field engineering. They complete,\r\nas far as possible under given circumstances, the theoretical lectures\r\nby personal view; they also offer the students opportunity for solving\r\nfitly chosen problems, to apply what has been learnt, and to prepare by\r\nreflection for practical service.\r\n\r\nThe exercises are to be conducted in each cœtus by the teachers who\r\nlecture on Engineering. The presence of the Artillery teacher is\r\nelsewhere separately noted.\r\n\r\nA. THE EXERCISES COMPRISE--\r\n\r\na. _For the First Cœtus._\r\n\r\n1. In unison with the teacher of Artillery and of General Engineering,\r\nthe examination of the fortress of Spandau, to make clear to the\r\nstudents the combination of the details of a complete fortress from an\r\nactual example.\r\n\r\n2. Examination of the models of fortresses and their details in the\r\nArsenal, to make clear the principles of a siege.\r\n\r\n3. Visiting the exercising-ground of the Engineer division of the guard\r\nin all its details.\r\n\r\n4. Marking out, tracing, profiling, calculation of the cubic\r\nmeasurements, of the time for building, of the number of workmen, and of\r\nthe garrison for given fortifications on ground near Berlin.\r\n\r\n5. Being present at the exercises of the Engineer division of the guard\r\nin sapping, mining, building redoubts, laying bridges, and their\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nb. _For the Second Cœtus._\r\n\r\n1. Examining the models in the model-house, partly to illustrate the\r\nsystems taught, partly to show the influence of ground on the situation,\r\nform, and contrivance of the works; and again to explain by the aid of\r\nthe necessary notices of the sieges of these fortresses the choice of\r\nthe fronts of attack, and other matters relating to sieges.\r\n\r\n2. Problems on the ground for sieges, such as may happen, to a subaltern\r\nofficer, as simple as possible, but to be solved clearly and exactly.\r\n\r\nThese exercises refer principally to the marking out of parallels,\r\nzig-zags, and saps, as well as marking out and tracing siege batteries.\r\nThey are to be undertaken under the united direction of the teachers of\r\nSpecial Engineering and of Artillery on the exercise ground of the Guard\r\nEngineer division.\r\n\r\n3. Problems on field fortification, not too comprehensively drawn out,\r\nbut of which the solution should be the more complete. Here belong,\r\n_e.g._, the fortifying of a house, a farmstead, a bridge, or other\r\ndefile, covering of an advanced post, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nc. _For the Third Cœtus._\r\n\r\n1. For the Artillerists:--Exercises in reconnaissances of fortresses.\r\nFixing the points for laying down batteries of attack. Statements of the\r\narming of detached works against _coups de main_ and formal attacks.\r\nSketches of instructions for subordinates in particular cases.\r\nConstruction of ammunition and other depôts in and before a fortress.\r\nUnder the guidance of the Artillery teacher of the third cœtus, with\r\nregard to the analogous regulations of the teacher of Exclusive\r\nEngineering.\r\n\r\n2. For Engineers:--_a._ Reconnaissance of Spandau in reference to\r\nprojects in permanent and field fortification, as well as military\r\narchitecture and hydraulic works, under the guidance of the teacher of\r\nExclusive Engineering, with the assistance of the teacher of\r\nFortification-drawing.\r\n\r\n_b._ In conjunction with the Artillerists, reconnaissance of Spandau for\r\nfixing a front of attack, securing its investment by field fortification\r\nadapted to the ground. Placing the depôts of material. Marking out the\r\nfirst parallel, with its communications, as well as the subsequent works\r\nof attack. Measures of the defenders, special discussion on arming the\r\nworks on the spot. Under the guidance of the teacher of Exclusive\r\nEngineering, having regard to the analogous regulations of the Artillery\r\nteacher in the third cœtus.\r\n\r\nB. FIXING AND APPORTIONING THE TIME.\r\n\r\na. _For the First Cœtus:_--\r\n\r\n  1. The visits prescribed in 1 and 2 for this cœtus are to be\r\n     made in spring, whilst the theoretical course is going on,\r\n     and for them are fixed,                                    2 days.\r\n  2. The further exercises under 3, 4, and 5, are to be taken\r\n     in the summer months; to them are allotted, for the visit\r\n     at 3,                                                      1  “\r\n  To the exercises at 4,                                        5  “\r\n  To        “      at 5,                                        6  “\r\n                                                               --\r\n    Total,                                                     14  “\r\n\r\nb. _For the Second Cœtus:_--\r\n\r\nThe exercises under 1, 2, 3 for this cœtus, are to be held in the\r\nSummer, and are thus regulated:--\r\n\r\n  For the visit at 1,             2 days.\r\n  To the exercises at 2,          2  “\r\n  To               at 3,          8  “\r\n                                 --\r\n          Total,                 12  “\r\n\r\nc. _For the Third Cœtus:_--\r\n\r\nThe exercises ordered for this class are to take place only in Spring,\r\nwhilst the theoretical instruction is going on, and for it are fixed:--\r\n\r\n  1. For exercises by the Engineers alone,                     2 days.\r\n  2. For those jointly by Engineers and Artillerists,          3  “\r\n                                                              --\r\n          Total,                                               5  “\r\n\r\nThe days of the calendar for these exercises are to be proposed by the\r\nteachers when delivering in their annual sketch of exercises, and their\r\npropositions will be laid by the Direction before the authorities for\r\ntheir approval.\r\n\r\nTo engage the pupils to work they are to be divided for the visits and\r\nexercises into suitable sections. Each section receives its problem from\r\nthe teacher, who also nominates the president of the section. This\r\npresident distributes the sub-sections among the other students, and\r\nsees that the work to be written and drawn is finished in the required\r\ntime, signed by the author, and is delivered by him to the teacher.\r\nGreat care is to be taken that single students do not remain unoccupied;\r\nthe disturbances thence only too likely to arise are always injurious to\r\nthe instruction and the discipline. In giving out problems, their\r\nprincipal conditions only are to be designated by the teacher, and the\r\ndevelopment left entirely to the student, or with little aid from the\r\nteacher, in order that the student may gain early that confidence and\r\nindependence necessary to the soldier in carrying out matters committed\r\nto his charge.\r\n\r\nIn the exercises the workmen demanded for marking out, are to be limited\r\nas much as possible, as the students must perform the greatest part of\r\nthe work themselves. The number indispensably necessary will be demanded\r\nin time by the teacher from the Guard Engineer Division through the\r\nDirection.\r\n\r\nThe necessary material, if the Guard Engineer Division can not furnish\r\nit as a loan, may be purchased at the charge of the school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR OR STAFF SCHOOL AT BERLIN.\r\n\r\nBY GENERAL VON HOPENER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. OBJECT, PLAN AND STAFF OF THE INSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nThe War School (_Kriegs-Schule_) is intended to receive officers of all\r\narms, who during three years of active service have given proof of\r\nability and of particular capacity. They find there the means for\r\nacquiring the knowledge requisite for the higher ranks of the service,\r\nfor the duties of officers of the staff, and for all other appointments\r\nwhich demand military and scientific studies of a higher and more\r\ngeneral character than the common ones.\r\n\r\nThe course of study is for three years, and is divided amongst three\r\nclasses. The courses begin on the 1st of October, and continue to the\r\n1st of July. The number of officers who can be received is 120, neither\r\nroom nor means of instruction sufficing for more. The three months of\r\nvacation in the summer are employed by the pupils in learning the\r\nservice of those arms of the profession to which they do not belong.\r\n\r\nThe Special Direction of the War School consists,--\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Of the Military Direction.\r\n  (_b_) Of the Direction of Studies.\r\n\r\nThe Military Direction consists of a director, a field officer connected\r\nwith the direction as inspector, and an adjutant, who directs the\r\naccounts of the Institution.\r\n\r\nThe military director is supreme, both over the military officers who\r\nare members of direction, and of the military officers who are studying\r\nin the school. The police, the discipline, and all the administration of\r\nthe Institution are under his control. All the subordinate officers in\r\nthe house are under his orders. The field officer attached to him is\r\ncharged to look carefully to the discipline and to the due attendance at\r\nthe lectures. The adjutant directs the correspondence and accounts of\r\nthe establishment. The whole of the staff and the military directors are\r\nlodged in the school.\r\n\r\nThe Direction of Studies is in the hands of three field officers of\r\nliterary and scientific attainments, and of two other persons, civilians\r\nof Berlin, of high literary reputation. Its president is the senior\r\nofficer, who is generally also the military director. It has also a\r\nsecretary attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe Direction or Board of Studies is exclusively intrusted with the care\r\nof everything affecting the teaching of the Institution, and its members\r\nare bound to be frequently present at the lectures. It has also under\r\nits inspection all the means and objects required for teaching, such as\r\nthe library, the collection of maps and models, the collections for\r\nphysical science, and the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe Director of Studies selects the professors of the Institution,\r\nrecommends them to the superior authorities, and in case of their\r\nappointment gives them their instructions.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of each course the direction fixes the plan of the\r\nlectures, and if any alterations in them are required, proposes them to\r\nthe superior authorities for their sanction.\r\n\r\nThe Direction of Studies regulates the examinations which the officers\r\nwho are candidates for admission into the school are to undergo. With\r\nthis view it draws up a certain number of subjects and questions suited\r\nfor the purpose, which it sends, in the spring of each year, to the\r\nchiefs of the staff of the different Corps d’Armée, in whose presence\r\nthe candidates do their work. Those of the candidates whose work is\r\nsatisfactory are entered at once in the school.\r\n\r\nIn order to take account of the progress of the students the board of\r\nstudies makes them pass an examination in writing at the end of every\r\nthree months; makes a revision of the judgment of the professors upon\r\nthe papers, and conjointly with the military board of direction, gives\r\ncertificates at the end of the triennial course to the officers who have\r\ngone through it completely. In these studies it is the part of the board\r\nof studies to give a judgment on the scientific merit, and that of the\r\nmilitary board to judge the moral conduct of the officers.\r\n\r\nThe two boards make a report yearly on the progress and the conduct of\r\nthe officers of the school. This report is submitted to the king by the\r\nminister of war. Particular mention is made of those officers who by\r\nextraordinary success have deserved his majesty’s favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SUBJECTS AND AIDS OF INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nAttendance on the different courses is partly obligatory, partly\r\ncompulsory, with this restriction, however, that every student must\r\nattend twenty lectures a week, given before 12 o’clock, including the\r\nobligatory courses. These last are those of the purely military\r\nsciences, and for the first class those of mathematics. As it is\r\nimpossible for most of the pupils to give sufficient attention to all\r\nthe courses to be examined in them at the end of each three months, they\r\nare allowed to select those of the courses which they may choose to\r\nfollow. But this choice once made must be adhered to.\r\n\r\nThe instruction is divided into theoretical courses and practical\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical courses comprehend all the subjects which come within\r\nthe object of the Institution. They are the following:--\r\n\r\n  1. Mathematics, a course of three years, six lectures a week, half\r\nemployed in statement of the theory, half in the practical application.\r\n\r\n  2. The Higher Geodesy, in the third class, three lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  3. Physical Geography, in the first class, two lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  4. General Geography, in the first class, four lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  5. Special Geography, particularly that of the probable theaters of\r\nWar for Prussia, in the second class, four lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  6. Universal History, in the first and second class, four lectures a\r\nweek in each.\r\n\r\n  7. General History of Literature, in the third class, four lectures a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n  8. Logic, in the second class, four lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  9. Physical Science, in the second class, four lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  10. Chemistry, in the third class, four lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  11. Physiology of the Horse, in the second class, two lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  12. Tactics, in the first and second classes, four lectures a week in\r\neach.\r\n\r\n  13. Artillery, in the first class, three lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  14. Fortification, a course of three years in the three classes. In\r\nthe first class, Field Fortification; in the second, Permanent\r\nFortification; in the third, the Conduct of Sieges; two lectures a week\r\nin each class.\r\n\r\n  15. Military Administration, in the first class, two lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  16. Military History, in the third class, seven lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  17. Duties of the Staff, in the third class, three lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  18. Military Law, in the third class, one lecture a week.\r\n\r\n  All these lectures are given in the morning, between eight and one\r\no’clock.\r\n\r\n  19. The French Language, a course of three years in different classes;\r\ninto each of which the pupils enter according to the knowledge they\r\npossess of the language; six lectures a week for each class.\r\n\r\n  20. The Russian Language, four lectures a week.\r\n\r\n  The above two courses are in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe practical work is done after the end of the courses of the second\r\nand third classes. They consist in making the officers draw plans for\r\nmilitary objects, make sketches of ground.\r\n\r\nThese exercises are completed by a journey of fifteen days under the\r\nconduct of an officer of the staff, in order to teach the service of an\r\nofficer of the staff in the country.\r\n\r\nThe instruments of teaching consist of--\r\n\r\n1. A library for the use of professors and students, and a collection of\r\nmaps and plans, all under the charge of a librarian living within the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n2. A collection of models for the courses of artillery and\r\nfortification, under the care of a commissary of the school.\r\n\r\n3. A cabinet of physical science, under the direction of a professor\r\nlodged in the house.\r\n\r\n4. A laboratory and chemical apparatus, under the direction of a\r\nprofessor of chemistry.\r\n\r\nThere are no manuals specially used for the instruction.\r\n\r\nFor the courses of geography and of the history of war, the direction\r\nfurnishes the pupils with the plans and maps required, as far as the\r\nmeans of the Institution allow it, or it procures them at moderate\r\nprices, to be repaid by instalments.\r\n\r\nPROFESSORS AND STUDENTS.\r\n\r\nThe officers acting as professors in the school are officers of mature\r\nage, and high education, chosen from the garrison of Berlin. The teacher\r\nof the duties of the staff, must always belong to this corps. They are\r\nappointed to their work in the school for an indefinite time, without\r\nprejudice to their other duties.\r\n\r\nThe civil professors are generally chosen from those of the Royal\r\nUniversity at Berlin.\r\n\r\nWith regard to discipline, all the professors are subject to the board\r\nof military direction; with regard to teaching, to the board of\r\ndirection of studies.\r\n\r\nEvery professor is bound upon entering on his functions to lay before\r\nthe board of direction of studies a programme stating the bearing, the\r\nsuccessive subjects, and the arrangement of his course. This programme\r\nmust be approved by the direction.\r\n\r\nThe payment of professors is fixed according to the number of their\r\nweekly lectures. It is less for the professors of Language, as they\r\nrequire less time to prepare their lectures.\r\n\r\nThe students of the school are under the immediate authority of the\r\nmilitary direction; but they are ordered to look upon the professors,\r\nwhilst engaged in their duties, as their superiors, so that offences\r\nagainst them are subject to military law.\r\n\r\nPermission to follow the courses of the school involves for every\r\nofficer the obligation to serve two years in the army for every year\r\npassed in the school.\r\n\r\nAlthough the complete course is for three years, officers do not always\r\ncontinue it for more than one year. At the end of the year those only\r\nare allowed to return who have shown themselves deserving of this favor.\r\nStudents lose the right of continuing their studies who neglect their\r\nlectures, or show indifference and a want of interest in their work, who\r\ncome often too late, avoid the duties imposed upon them, or endeavor to\r\nescape their examinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUSSIAN STAFF IN 1869.[11]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: By Col. Beauchamp Walker, C. B. 1869.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Prussian Staff (_Generalstab_) which has been completely reorganized\r\nsince the war of 1866, subserves the double purpose of providing staff\r\nofficers for the duties of the active army, and of collecting and\r\narranging the statistical, geographical, and historical information\r\nnecessary for the operations of war; further, it is the school in which\r\nyoung officers temporarily detached from their regiments, after a course\r\nof instruction at the Military Academy, have their qualifications tested\r\nbefore admittance to this branch of the army, and the principal office\r\nof the trigonometrical survey of the Eastern Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe head-quarters of this organization are at Berlin, where a large\r\nbuilding is appropriated to the various offices and departments, in\r\nwhich the chief of the staff, General von Moltke, resides. It has two\r\nestablishments:--\r\n\r\n  1.  The peace-establishment, divided into--\r\n    _A._  Chief _état_, subdivided into\r\n      (_a._) The staff of the commands.\r\n      (_b._) The general staff, or _grosser Generalstab_.\r\n    _B._ The accessory _état, neben Etat_.\r\n  2. The war establishment.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the commands is so complete during peace as to require a\r\nvery unimportant augmentation, and that chiefly in the lower grades, on\r\nthe outbreak of war; the framework not only exists, but the officers\r\ncomprising it are already acquainted with the generals under whom they\r\nserve, and with the officers and troops with whom they have to\r\ncommunicate.\r\n\r\nAt the head-quarters of each corps there are: a chief of the\r\nstaff--sometimes a Major-General, more frequently a Colonel,\r\nexceptionally a Lieutenant-Colonel--a field officer, and a captain; at\r\nthat of each division a field officer; there is also a chief of the\r\nstaff with the General Inspection of the artillery. The subordinate\r\nduties are performed by the aides-de-camp, of whom there are two at the\r\nhead-quarters of each corps, and one with each division and brigade; but\r\nthese officers are not included in the establishments of the general\r\nstaff, and wear the uniform of their respective regiments; are in no\r\nsense of the word aides-de-camp as existing in the English army; they\r\nbear the designation of _Adjutant_, and may more properly be compared to\r\nour Deputy Assistants and Brigade Majors: indeed the solitary Adjutant\r\nis the only assistant to the Major-General in the performance of the\r\nbrigade duties. In the time of war the staff is further supplemented by\r\n_Ordonanz Offiziere_ attached as aids to the general officers in\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThe _Grosser Generalstab_ includes the officers of the staff who are not\r\nemployed with the commands, and is stationed in Berlin under the\r\npersonal direction of the chief of the staff. The _Neben_ or _accessory\r\nEtat_ includes the officers employed in the strictly scientific work\r\nallotted to this department.\r\n\r\nThe combined staff at head-quarters is subdivided as follows:\r\n\r\n  _a._ The three Sections;\r\n  _b._ The section for military history;\r\n  _c._ Trigonometrical section;\r\n  _d._ Topographical section;\r\n  _e._ Geographical-statistical section;\r\n  _f._ The map-room.\r\n\r\nThe three sections have the object of collecting and arranging\r\ninformation respecting the home and foreign armies. The home subjects to\r\nbe treated are the means and warlike institutions of the State, its\r\nfortresses, magazines, ports, inland communications, the organization,\r\nrecruiting, mobilization, armament, equipment, and drill of the army.\r\nThe warlike systems of foreign nations, the strength and organization of\r\ntheir armies, regulations, and drill, the distribution of the troops,\r\nstate of preparation for active service, and their systems of\r\nreinforcement and reserves, are the further subjects of inquiry. For\r\nthese purposes the work is divided as follows, according to the division\r\ninto--\r\n\r\n_1st Section._--Austria, Russia, Sweden and Norway, Denmark, Turkish\r\nEmpire, Greece, Asia.\r\n\r\n_2d Section._--Prussia and North Germany, South Germany, Italy,\r\nSwitzerland.\r\n\r\n_3d Section._--France, Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain,\r\nPortugal, America.\r\n\r\nThe number of officers actually belonging to the two categories of\r\nprincipal and accessory establishments of the staff is 115, of whom 94\r\nbelong to the first, and 21 to the second named branch. In the first\r\nthere are 17 chiefs of the staff--viz., 13 with the army corps, one with\r\nthe General Inspection of the artillery, and three at the head of the\r\nthree sections--47 field officers, and 29 captains. In the accessory\r\nestablishment there are four chiefs, five field officers, and 12\r\ncaptains.\r\n\r\nThe office establishment, inclusive of the Engineer geographers--who are\r\nnon-commissioned officers of the Artillery or Engineers serving\r\npermanently in the trigonometrical section in place of the officers who\r\nwere till recently employed temporarily in this office, and of whom\r\nthere are at present 10--consists of 18 permanent officials, not\r\nincluding a head messenger, two chancery servants, two house servants,\r\nand a porter.\r\n\r\nThe supernumeraries comprise 40 officers attached for a year, 20 for\r\nduty with the staff generally, the remainder for surveying; 34 surveyors\r\nwho are only employed during about five months in each year, and 41\r\ndraughtsmen.\r\n\r\nThe pay of the permanent staff amounts to 206,150 thalers, or 30,922_l._\r\n10_s._, the material expenses being 62,250 thalers, or 9,339_l._ 10_s._\r\nOf this latter sum about two-thirds is required for office and surveying\r\nexpenses; 17,000 thalers, or 2,550_l._, are allowed for the annual\r\njourneys of instruction undertaken by the staff, and 3,000 thalers, or\r\n450_l._, for allowances to officers traveling for scientific or\r\nprofessional purposes.\r\n\r\nThe actual sum disbursed for office and surveying purposes is 47,450\r\nthalers, or 7,417_l._ 10_s._, of which 7,000 thalers, or 1,050_l._, are\r\nrecovered by the sale of maps and works published by the staff, 2,000\r\nthalers, or 300_l._, being derived from the profits of the bi-weekly\r\nmilitary paper, “_Militair Wochen Blatt_.”\r\n\r\nBesides the duties already mentioned, the staff at head-quarters\r\nundertakes:\r\n\r\n  1. The training of officers for staff purposes. To this end young\r\nofficers who have passed the prescribed three years at the Military\r\nAcademy, “_Kriegs Akademie_,” are attached for a year to the different\r\nsections, where they are required to draw up reports on strategical and\r\ntactical questions, critical reports on the military events of past\r\neras, descriptions of the ground embraced in military operations, and of\r\nthe military organization of foreign countries. These essays, when of\r\nspecial value, are laid before the chief of the staff.\r\n\r\n  2. The preparation of printed reports on foreign armies, which are\r\ndistributed to the staff officers employed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  3. The contribution of papers on professional subjects to the\r\n“_Militair Wochen Blatt_,” or military paper.\r\n\r\nThis publication, which appears twice a week, was formerly edited in the\r\noffice of the staff, but has lately been in the hands of a responsible\r\neditor, a colonel on half-pay, who stands, however, in intimate\r\nconnection with the office. The contribution required from the staff is\r\ntwenty sheets of printed matter annually from the various departments, a\r\nmuch larger amount being furnished, from which the chief selects what he\r\nconsiders suitable for publication.\r\n\r\n  4. Military tours of instruction, for which a sum of 2,550_l._ is\r\nannually granted.\r\n\r\nAll the officers who can be spared from the duties of the office take\r\npart in these tours, as also a few staff officers called in from the\r\ncommands, and a selection from the commanders of regiments.\r\n\r\nThey are also made on a smaller scale by the staff of the Corps,\r\naugmented by regimental officers attached for instruction, under the\r\nsuperintendence of the respective chiefs of the staff.\r\n\r\nFor the tour superintended by General Von Moltke, the theatre of\r\noperations and certain conditions likely to influence them are\r\nindicated, a supposed strength is given to two opposing armies, their\r\ndepots and means of reinforcement are clearly laid down, and the\r\ninfluence likely to be exerted by the movements of other armies or\r\nbodies of troops on their flanks are taken into calculation. According\r\nto these data the senior officers present make their plans of manœuvre,\r\nemploying their juniors in the preparation of all the subordinate\r\narrangements, the movements of the troops, the selection of positions\r\nfor attack or defense, the arrangements for supply, and for retaining a\r\ncommunication with the base. All these measures are carried out on the\r\nspot, and daily reports are made to the superintending officer, which,\r\nwhen necessary, are accompanied by such rough sketches as are usual\r\nduring the progress of a campaign.\r\n\r\nFrom these materials he is enabled to form an idea in what degree the\r\nspirit of the operations has been grasped by the directing officers, and\r\nin how far their juniors are instructed in the details of duties which\r\nthey may hereafter be called on to perform.\r\n\r\n  5. A large share in the military education of the army generally, by\r\ntaking part in the lectures given in the various educational\r\nestablishments, and by acting as members of the commissions of\r\nexamination and of studies.\r\n\r\n  6. Officers of the head-quarter staff are also detached to attend the\r\nannual corps manœuvres, those taking place in foreign countries, or the\r\nactive campaigns of friendly allied nations.\r\n\r\nOf the three sections into which the head-quarter staff is divided, the\r\nrailway department forms part of the second of these sections, the chief\r\nof which selects an officer to preside over and superintend the working\r\nof it, and gather materials on inland and foreign railway communication.\r\nCertain officers are attached permanently, similarly, in fact, to those\r\nbelonging to the sections of the accessory establishment, who have not\r\nonly to make themselves theoretically masters of their subject, but by\r\ntraveling on the various lines acquire practical acquaintance with the\r\nworking of railway transport in all its phases. With a view to diffusing\r\nthis knowledge as largely as possible, all officers of the staff have\r\nsince 1867 been required to attend a six weeks’ course of study with\r\nthis branch.\r\n\r\nThe section of military history has charge of the war archives of the\r\nPrussian army and of the library of the general staff, for additions to\r\nwhich latter a sum of 1,100 thalers, or 165_l._, annually, is voted.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the section is occupied not only with subjects of recent\r\nand immediate interest, but with the study and arrangement of materials\r\nbelonging and relating to the wars of earlier date, of which there is a\r\nvaluable collection, consisting of reports, day-books, plans, and other\r\ndocuments, many of them legacies of the prominent actors in the scenes\r\nto which they relate. The library is well supplied with the most\r\nimportant works in all languages on military history, tactics,\r\ngeography, and military science.\r\n\r\nThe trigonometrical and topographical sections stand in intimate\r\nconnection with each other. Since 1865 the former is charged with the\r\nsurvey of the Eastern Provinces, a work which it is hoped will be\r\nconcluded in ten years, under the direction of the chief of the staff.\r\n\r\nUnder the present organization there are always forty young officers\r\nattached to the head-quarter staff, but only for one year, their absence\r\nfrom regimental duty having proved detrimental, while the current work\r\nis naturally better executed when carried out by permanent _employés_,\r\nthus avoiding the interruption caused by constant reliefs.\r\n\r\nThe geographical-statistical is a new section, the necessity for which\r\narose from the overcrowding of other branches, particularly of the\r\nmap-room. So much material had accumulated in the other branches that it\r\nwas found necessary to establish a section in which the scattered\r\ninformation could be condensed in the form of statistics. To this end\r\nthe former geographical subsection was altered into its present form\r\nwith an enlarged sphere of work, and the charge of the collection of\r\nmaps was transferred to it from the map-room, which had become so much\r\novercrowded with old materials as to have neither room nor time for the\r\nordinary business of taking charge of the current surveys and of the\r\nmaps and charts intended for distribution to the army.\r\n\r\nWith a view to facilitating the collection of the best geographical and\r\nstatistical materials all the sections are placed _en rapport_ with the\r\nnew section, to which they are required to forward all special material\r\ncoming under notice, and all books or pamphlets which contain\r\ngeographical or statistical information. This section stands also in\r\nconstant communication with the civil statistical bureau.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the “_Plankammer_” (map-room) are now restricted to the\r\ncare of the topographical instruments of the original surveys of the\r\ntopographical section, of new maps prepared for distribution, and of the\r\nfinancial business of the general staff. All the scientific duties of\r\nthe map-room have passed over to the geographical statistical section.\r\n\r\nThere is no regulation on the admission of officers to the staff, nor is\r\nthere any direct preliminary examination. They are selected from:--\r\n\r\n1. Those who have completed the prescribed course at the Military\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\n2. Those who notify their desire to enter the staff.\r\n\r\n3. Those who are recommended by their superiors as officers likely to\r\nbecome useful staff officers.\r\n\r\nThe year of probation at head-quarters, already mentioned, affords the\r\nopportunity of forming an opinion as to the capabilities of these\r\nofficers, who at its conclusion return to their regiments, where they\r\nare usually employed as adjutants, or, on the occurrence of vacancies,\r\nwith the brigades, divisions, or corps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUSSIAN MILITARY EDUCATION IN 1869-70.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGES SINCE 1856.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks are gathered from the “Report of the Military\r\nEducation Commission presented to both Houses of Parliament,” in 1870,\r\nin continuation of the Report submitted in 1856, on the Systems of\r\nMilitary Education in France, and Prussia.\r\n\r\n  1. The chief alterations that have taken place in the system of\r\nmilitary education in Prussia since 1856, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    (_a._) All the educational establishments have been very much\r\nenlarged, owing to the increase in the army which has taken place since\r\n1866.\r\n\r\n    (_b._) The educational requirements for a commission remain in\r\nprinciple the same as they were--the double examination for the rank of\r\nofficer, and the exaction from every candidate for a commission of proof\r\nof both general and professional knowledge being still the peculiar\r\nfeature of Prussian military education. There has been, however, a\r\nconstant tendency to raise the standard of the preliminary examination\r\nin subjects of general knowledge, and to insist more strongly upon a\r\nsound liberal education as a condition of obtaining a commission. The\r\nnumber of _Abiturienten_, or men who have passed through the complete\r\ncourse at a public school, entering the army annually is now four times\r\nas great as it was in 1856, and there is the strongest wish still\r\nfurther to increase their number.\r\n\r\n    (_c._) The Cadet Schools in their general character are unaltered;\r\nthe introduction of the peculiar class of the Ober-prima in the Upper\r\nCadet School at Berlin is the most important modification made in their\r\norganization. The proportion of officers supplied by the Cadet Schools\r\ncontinues much the same as it was in 1856. The feeling in the army,\r\nhowever, against preparatory military schools appears to be increasing;\r\na strong opinion is entertained as to the narrowing effects upon the\r\nmind of exclusive class education; and a preference is very generally\r\nexhibited for officers who have had the ordinary education of civil\r\nschools. At the War Schools (_Diossi, on Schools in 1856_), the\r\nArtillery and Engineer School, and the War Academy (_Staff School in\r\n1856_), a decided opinion was expressed as to the intellectual\r\nsuperiority of the _Abiturienten_ over those who have been educated in\r\nthe Cadet Corps.\r\n\r\n    (_d._) The arrangements for the professional instruction of officers\r\nof corps have been very much altered. These officers now have their\r\neducation up to the time of obtaining their commissions in common with\r\ncandidates for the line; their _special_ instruction does not commence\r\nat the Artillery and Engineer School until they have been in the service\r\nthree or four years. For the Artillery, the course at this school has\r\nbeen reduced to one year, and made strictly practical in character.\r\n\r\n    (_e._) The course of instruction at the War Academy, or Senior\r\nDepartment, has been considerably modified; though still comprising many\r\nsubjects of an entirely unprofessional character, their number has been\r\nreduced; the attention of the students is more concentrated upon\r\nmilitary studies than formerly, and a larger amount of time is devoted\r\nto practical work. In short, the object has been to render the\r\ninstruction less purely theoretical than it formerly was.\r\n\r\n    (_f._) The most important change, however, which has been made is in\r\nregard to the War Schools--the Schools at which officers of all arms\r\nreceive their _professional_ instruction. Since 1856 they have been\r\nentirely re-organized, and placed under the direct control of the\r\nCentral Educational Department; a much higher class of teachers are\r\nemployed; the character of the instruction has been greatly improved;\r\nand attendance at one of these schools is, with rare exceptions, made\r\ncompulsory upon every one before obtaining a commission. These schools\r\nhold a most important position in the Prussian system of military\r\neducation, and the greatest pains are bestowed on making them answer the\r\npurpose for which they are intended--that of giving a thoroughly\r\npractical instruction in military subjects to candidates for\r\ncommissions. The improvements made in the War Schools show the greatly\r\nincreased importance attached of late years in Prussia to the\r\nprofessional instruction of officers.\r\n\r\n  2. However different the French and Prussian systems may be in some\r\nrespects, they both agree in this--that no attempt is made to give a\r\nspecial military education at an early age, that a general education is\r\nmade the ground-work of the professional training, and that at least up\r\nto the age of 17 or 18 the future officer receives the same kind of\r\neducation as the civilian, and in the great majority of cases receives\r\nit at the ordinary schools of the country. In Austria, also, the same\r\nprinciple seems now to have been adopted. The cadet schools in Prussia\r\nare no exception to the rule, for the instruction at them, except in the\r\ntwo upper classes at Berlin, is the same as at civil schools. The\r\nprinciple of deferring military education to a comparatively late age\r\nis, indeed, in Prussia carried even to a greater extent than in France,\r\nfor all professional instruction is postponed until after the service\r\nhas been entered, and regimental duty been performed for nearly a year.\r\nThe few who enter the army from the Ober-prima and Selecta of the Cadet\r\nCorps (not amounting to 70 each year) are the only individuals who\r\nreceive any military instruction before joining the service, and in\r\ntheir case this special instruction does not commence until the age of\r\n17. So strongly is this principle insisted upon, that even for the\r\nartillery and engineers there is no preparatory military education, and\r\nthe special instruction of the officers of these arms is not given until\r\nafter they have been some years in the service. The idea in Prussia is\r\nthat a young man can derive no advantage from studying the _theory_ of\r\nthe military profession until he has learnt the _practice_ of it. “What\r\nuse can it be,” it was said, “to talk to a lad of the principles of\r\ntactics, when he does not even know the movements of a battalion, and\r\nperhaps has never seen one on parade?”\r\n\r\n  3. After, however, entering the service _all_ the officers of the\r\nPrussian army receive a careful professional instruction--that given at\r\nthe War Schools. The course is of an essentially practical character,\r\ncomprising only strictly military subjects, and excluding such studies\r\nas mathematics and even languages.\r\n\r\n  4. The officers of the staff do not necessarily receive any special\r\ntraining previous to their appointment; but in Prussia this is of less\r\nimportance, as from the professional education which every officer has\r\nhad, those appointed to the staff, even if they have not passed through\r\nthe Senior Department, must at least be acquainted with field sketching\r\nand military regulations, and know something of fortifications and\r\nartillery. Moreover, after appointment, means are taken in the “staff\r\nexpeditions” which occur annually, to instruct them in their practical\r\nduties, and (as is the case also in France with the officers of the\r\nStaff Corps) to insure their keeping up the knowledge of field sketching\r\nand reconnaissance which they had previously acquired.\r\n\r\n  5. The connection which exists in Prussia between the military system\r\nand the general education of the country is remarkable.\r\n_Portefée-fahnrich_, examinations are not only based on the course of\r\ninstruction at civil schools, but have been also used as a means of\r\nraising the character of the education given at these schools. On the\r\none hand, the advantages offered to _Abiturienten_ and to those who have\r\nbeen at a university, indicate a wish to encourage men of liberal\r\neducation to enter the army as officers; on the other hand, by making\r\nexemption from the ordinary period of compulsory service in the ranks\r\ndependent (among other conditions) on educational attainments, the\r\nmilitary system has been employed as an engine for stimulating education\r\namong the middle classes.\r\n\r\n  6. The general management of military education is vested in a single\r\nofficer, the Inspector-General. He is assisted by two Boards or\r\nCouncils, the Board of Studies in matters connected with the general\r\nsystem of instruction, and the Supreme Examination Board in regard to\r\nthe examinations and qualifications for commissions. The system of\r\neducation has been still further centralized since 1856, especially in\r\nthe case of the War Schools; and much of the progress that has been made\r\nis ascribed to the unity now given to the whole system of instruction.\r\nAt the same time each of the educational institutions has its own Board\r\nof Studies, similar to the _conseils d’instruction_, at the French\r\nschools, who are charged with the general control of the course of study\r\nand with the duty of making suggestions for its improvement. Several of\r\nthe professors, both civil and military, are always members of this\r\nBoard; so that the benefit of their practical experience is secured, and\r\nthe control of the instruction is never left entirely in the hands of\r\none man, nor even exclusively of military men. The introduction of the\r\ncivilian element into these Boards is deserving of notice; not merely\r\nthe professors of the schools, but eminent men connected with the\r\nUniversity of Berlin are employed upon them, and have a voice in\r\ndetermining the system of military education.\r\n\r\n  7. In discipline the heads of the various schools are almost entirely\r\nsupreme. At the War Schools the young men are subject to military law,\r\nbeing already in the army; at the Cadet Schools this is not the case,\r\nbut the discipline is strictly military in character. At both\r\nestablishments the regulations are extremely stringent, and the\r\nslightest irregularity entails punishment. But the importance attached\r\nto the exercise of moral influence over the pupils, the personal\r\ninterest taken in them, and the kindly relations existing between them\r\nand the officers, make the system of discipline much less rigidly\r\nmilitary than it is at the French schools. Both at the War Schools and\r\nthe Cadet House, specific punishments are attached to idleness.\r\n\r\n  8. In the appointment of the heads of the various schools and of the\r\nsubordinate officers employed at them, great attention seems to be paid\r\nto selecting individuals fitted for the posts both by educational\r\nexperience and by personal qualities. There appears to be rather a\r\ngeneral opinion that the instructors at most of the schools are\r\nunderpaid, and that this, combined with the preference frequently given\r\nto active military life, prevents the posts being much sought after by\r\nthe ablest officers. On the other hand, however, selection for such\r\nappointments is always regarded as a distinction; and in the Prussian\r\narmy mere honorary distinctions, altogether irrespective of material\r\nadvantages, are held in much higher estimation than is probably the case\r\nin any other service.\r\n\r\n  9. The most marked point of contrast between the French and Prussian\r\nsystems of military education consists in the thoroughly competitive\r\ncharacter of the former. In Prussia the principle of competition, though\r\nto a certain extent recognized, is little applied in practice, and never\r\nperhaps fully and strictly carried out. For promotion to the highest\r\nclass (the Selecta) of the Berlin Cadet house there is considerable\r\ncompetition among the pupils, and admission to the War Academy is\r\nobtained by competitive examination open to all the officers of the\r\narmy; but even in these two cases personal and other considerations come\r\nmore or less into play, and the rewards can not be said to be thrown\r\nopen to pure competition. All the other military examinations are simply\r\nqualifying, and there is no attempt to afford the stimulus of publishing\r\na list of the candidates arranged in order of merit. In fact the term\r\n“competitive examination” scarcely seems to be understood in Prussia.\r\nThe pecuniary assistance afforded by the State for the education of boys\r\nin the Cadet Schools is dependent solely on the circumstances and\r\nservices of the father, not on the abilities of the candidate himself.\r\n\r\n  10. The objections expressed to the further introduction of a\r\ncompetitive system appear to be universally entertained in the Prussian\r\narmy. The object in Prussia seems to be, not to attempt to establish an\r\naccurate _comparison_ of the educational attainments of a number of\r\nindividuals, but to form a _general estimate_ of the abilities,\r\ncharacter, and military capacity of each. The army generally are not\r\nconsidered to be losers by the rejection of the competitive principle;\r\nthe system of inspections and of reports from inspecting officers is so\r\nelaborate, and so many checks are provided, that the character and\r\nabilities of individual officers are well known; and appointments,\r\ncertainly as a general rule, are said to be made on the ground of real\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\n  11. There appears to be less strictness in enforcing the regulations\r\nconnected with military education in Prussia than in France. The\r\nregulations themselves are very stringent, but exceptions are constantly\r\nsanctioned--for instance, in the length of time which a pupil is\r\npermitted to remain in the same class of the Cadet Schools, in the\r\nnumber of failures allowed in the various examinations, &c.\r\n\r\n  12. The very great care bestowed upon the method of instruction at all\r\nthe Prussian military schools, is extremely remarkable. Individual\r\ninstructors are not left to follow out their own ideas of teaching, but\r\ncareful regulations are issued for their guidance by the\r\nInspector-General of Education, to which all are required strictly to\r\nconform. The system of small classes in striking contrast to the French\r\nplan of lectures to large numbers, is a remarkable instance of the\r\nanxiety to devote attention to individual students, and to adapt the\r\ninstruction to varieties of ability. But the most remarkable feature of\r\nthe system of teaching is the care bestowed upon the higher objects of\r\neducation, upon forming and disciplining the mind and encouraging habits\r\nof reflection. The regulations for the instructors at the various\r\nschools over and over again assert that the great object to be kept in\r\nview is, not merely to impart a certain amount of positive knowledge,\r\nbut to develope the intellectual faculties and to cultivate powers of\r\nthought and reasoning. The teachers are warned to avoid minute details\r\nand barren facts, which merely burden the memory and are soon forgotten,\r\nand to direct attention to broad principles, which will lay the\r\nfoundation for further individual study in after life. With the same\r\nobject in view, the examination questions are calculated, not merely to\r\nserve as an exercise of the memory, but to test an intelligent\r\nacquaintance with a subject, and the power of turning knowledge to a\r\nuseful purpose.\r\n\r\n  [Errata for Part II (Prussia):\r\n  _The spelling “militair” (for expected “militär”) occurs frequently\r\n  in this section._\r\n\r\n  Out of its twenty first directors\r\n    twenty-first\r\n  “appeared to him in painful contrast\r\n    _“ missing_\r\n  instead of the examination for the Swordknot, being declared\r\n    Swordknot.\r\n  for the commission of second lieutenant.\r\n    lieutentant\r\n  [The annual cost to the state of the military schools in 1856]\r\n  |   5,872 |     250 |   5,922 | [first row]\r\n  | 146,132 | 108,777 | 254,909 | [totals]\r\n    _the sums will come out right if the first-row total is corrected\r\n    to 6122, _and_ 4 is added to some item in the middle column (and\r\n    hence the third-column total)_\r\n  or unsatisfactory (_ungenügend_.)\r\n  the principles of plan drawing (_Terrain-Darstellung_;)\r\n    _both closing ) missing_\r\n  3.

MILITARY SYSTEM AND SCHOOLS IN AUSTRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. OUTLINE OF MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Army is recruited by conscription, the period of service\r\nbeing for eight years, with two years in addition for the reserve; but\r\nsuch soldiers as wish it may generally obtain leave after six years’\r\nservice. Those who serve eight years are understood to have a claim for\r\nemployment on railways and in the custom-houses. Substitutes are\r\nallowed, but they are provided solely by the State, and the means used\r\nfor supplying them is made an element towards securing good\r\nNon-Commissioned Officers for the Austrian Army, in the following\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe sum paid over by private individuals for avoiding service in the\r\nArmy is £150 (1,500 florins,) and the Government, in providing a\r\nsubstitute, pays him the _interest_ of this sum during his period of\r\nservice, and the _capital_ when it is completed. A good substitute is\r\npermitted to serve twice, and he may thus receive £300 (3,000 florins)\r\nwhen he quits the army. Generally speaking, the substitutes provided by\r\nthe Government are good Non-Commissioned Officers, who by these means\r\nare induced to continue a length of time in the service.\r\n\r\nThe Officers are obtained during a state of peace, either from the\r\nMilitary Academies, or by direct entry as Cadets, after passing a slight\r\nexamination, into the regiments of infantry and cavalry, in which\r\ncapacity they perform the ordinary duties of soldiers, and no particular\r\nperiod of service is required in this grade. The entry as Cadets is by\r\nnomination, part by the Colonels, proprietors of Regiments; part\r\nconsisting of those having claims on the Regiments; and part of those\r\nrecommended from the ranks.\r\n\r\nThose who join the Army from the Military Academies consist principally\r\nof the sons of military men, whose education is mainly provided for by\r\nthe State, and of others who are placed there by means of funds provided\r\nby provinces, districts, municipalities, or private individuals.\r\n\r\nAny Austrian subject has a _claim_ for admittance, on payment of the\r\nannual sum prescribed by the regulations.\r\n\r\nThere is no fixed proportion existing between the Infantry and Cavalry\r\nofficers supplied from the Military Academies, and those entering\r\nregiments directly as cadets, but it is understood that the former do\r\nnot amount to more than one-twentieth or one-thirtieth of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Artillery and Engineers are now entirely supplied with officers from\r\nthe Military Academies.\r\n\r\nThere is no difference in the pay of officers of the same rank in the\r\nvarious arms in Austria.\r\n\r\nOfficers when not required are placed on half-pay, which is rather less\r\nthan the half of their actual pay whilst serving. When an officer dies,\r\nhis widow is not entitled to a pension, but the state provides for the\r\neducation of the children; and to prevent distress, an officer is not\r\npermitted to marry unless he has a certain income, independent of his\r\npay, for the maintenance of his wife.\r\n\r\nThe promotion in the Infantry and Cavalry is regimental, and usually by\r\nseniority; but there is no doubt that promotion by selection also takes\r\nplace, though not in the regiment itself, the officer selected being\r\npromoted into another regiment. The promotion in the Artillery and\r\nEngineers is also by seniority, and by corps, and, until the Hungarian\r\nwar, was exceedingly slow.\r\n\r\nAlthough not actually sanctioned by the authorities, cases have occurred\r\nin the Austrian service where officers have purchased steps from others\r\nserving in _different_ regiments to themselves in the following\r\nmanner:--if any officer is about to retire from the service, the\r\npromotion in the regiment being by seniority, the officer whose turn it\r\nwould be to obtain the promotion would frequently sell his right to a\r\njunior officer serving in another regiment, who would thus be promoted\r\ninto the vacancy. We were informed that this system had formerly led to\r\nfrequent duels between the officer obtaining the promotion, and those\r\nofficers in the regiment whose prospects were directly injured, by the\r\nsenior having sold his promotion, and thus stopped their advancement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. OUTLINE OF SYSTEM OF MILITARY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary education in Austria has been entirely remodeled since the\r\nHungarian war, and is now conducted in a very regular and systematic\r\nmanner under the sole control and supervision of the Fourth Section of\r\nthe Supreme War Department, entitled “Military Schools.”\r\n\r\nThe establishment consists besides of--\r\n\r\n  2 Majors of Infantry.\r\n  1 Captain of Artillery.\r\n  2 Captains of Infantry.\r\n  2 Lieutenants of Infantry.\r\n  2 Employés belonging to the Administration.\r\n  6 Clerks.\r\n  6 Messengers.\r\n\r\nTo show the great importance of the Fourth Section, it will only be\r\nnecessary to state that the disbursements of the government for Military\r\nEducation in Austria for the current year are estimated at £281,440,\r\n(2,814,400 florins,) without taking into consideration the sums\r\ncontributed for foundations by provinces, districts, and private\r\nindividuals, or of those received for the education of paying students.\r\nThis sum of 2,814,400 florins is apportioned in the following manner--\r\n\r\n

Militär-Bildungs-Anstalten, mit besonderer\r\n    Rücksicht auf die Vorschriften für den Eintritt in dieselben,\r\n    Zusammengestellt aus den allerhöchst sanctionirten Reglements der\r\n    Militär-Bildungs-Anstalten. Wien, 1854_.” (_The Imperial Military\r\n    Institutions for Education_, with special reference to the\r\n    conditions required for admission, compiled from the regulations\r\n    sanctioned by His Majesty. Vienna, 1854)]\r\n\r\nThe Imperial institutions for Military Education, are divided into Three\r\nClasses. They are--\r\n\r\nA. Such Institutions as are immediately intended for the education of\r\npupils as Non-commissioned Officers; namely,\r\n\r\n  (1.) The Lower Military Houses of Education.\r\n  (2.) The Upper Military Houses of Education.\r\n  (3.) The School Companies.\r\n\r\nB. Institutions in which it is intended to educate pupils as Officers;\r\nnamely,\r\n\r\n  (1.) The Cadet Institutions.\r\n  (2.) The Military Academies.\r\n\r\nC. Such Institutions as partly give a special kind of instruction, and\r\npartly complete and carry out the previous education of Officers. These\r\nare--\r\n\r\n      (1.) The Institution for Military Teachers.\r\n      (2.) The Higher Course for the Artillery and Engineers.\r\n      (3.) The War School.\r\n\r\nIn the institutions of the first and second class, education as well as\r\ninstruction is given, but those of the third class are limited to\r\ninstruction; accordingly, all that is said in the following pages with\r\nregard to the admission of pupils, and with regard to beneficial\r\nfoundations, has no reference to institutions of the third class.\r\n\r\nAlthough each of the first-named classes forms a complete whole in\r\nitself, yet they stand in close mutual relation to each other, inasmuch\r\nas the most distinguished pupils of the Lower Houses of Education pass\r\ninto the Cadet Institutions; and in the same way the most distinguished\r\nscholars of the Scientific[2] School Companies, viz., those of the\r\nArtillery, Engineers, Pioneers, Flotilla, and Marine Schools, may be\r\ntransferred as attendant pupils[3] to the Academies; by this means they\r\nmay obtain a right to a position in the Army as Officers.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: _Techniche_ (technical) is the original word. Compare\r\n    its use in another matter; there are in the Artillery two\r\n    services, the ordinary Campaigning Artillery and the _Technical_\r\n    Artillery.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: _Frequentanten_, who frequent, attend, or visit the\r\n    school.]\r\n\r\nSo, on the other hand, insufficient progress may be a reason for\r\nscholars being removed from the Cadet Institutions and the Academies\r\ninto the Upper Houses of Education and the School Companies.\r\n\r\nBy these regulations a road is opened for the advancement of any talent\r\nthat may gradually develop itself; and at the same time the pupils of\r\nthe Institutions for Higher Military Education are submitted to that\r\nprocess of elimination which is requisite for the success of these\r\nInstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe pupils in the Institutions for Military Education are either\r\nfoundation pupils,[4] or paying pupils; the first are divided into the\r\nmilitary or treasury foundation pupils, and the provincial and private\r\nfoundation pupils.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: _Stiftlinge_, foundationers, and _Zahlende_, paying\r\n    pupils, the first, divided into, (1.) _Militär-Ararial_\r\n    foundationers, who are, as a rule, sons of Soldiers and Officers,\r\n    and are maintained at the expense of the Military Treasury, the\r\n    _Arar_, or _Ærarium_; (2.) Provincial foundationers, who are\r\n    maintained by the interest of lands or money granted in favor of\r\n    young men belonging to some particular province, Bohemia,\r\n    Gallicia, the Tyrol, Upper or Lower Austria, either by the Central\r\n    Government (the State,) or by the Estates or Parliament (_Stände_)\r\n    of the province; (3.) Private foundationers, under which name are\r\n    included not only those maintained by moneys left by private\r\n    individuals, but those also whose payments come from grants made\r\n    by municipal and local corporations.]\r\n\r\nThe military or treasury places belong to the army; the claim for these\r\ndepends upon the nature of the institution and the position of the\r\nparents. As a general rule, it may be laid down that children of\r\nofficers are expected to remain up to eleven years of age under the care\r\nof their parents, whereas those of common soldiers may in the eighth\r\nyear of their age be taken under the protection of the State.\r\n\r\nThe provincial foundations are bestowed upon the sons of the nobility,\r\nor of distinguished _employés_ of the state belonging to the crown lands\r\nof the province. Private foundations are those established by private\r\nindividuals or corporations, and the appointment to these depends upon\r\nthe conditions laid down by the founder. The capital or property of\r\nthese foundations is generally administered by the Supreme War\r\nDepartment.[5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: The _Ober-Militär Commando_, or\r\n    _Commandership-in-chief_, the Fourth Section of which has the\r\n    charge of Military Education. _Commando_ is the German word\r\n    corresponding to Commander, as _Ministry_ does to _Minister_, and\r\n    may signify one or more persons, a single Officer, or a Board of\r\n    Commissioners.]\r\n\r\nEvery Austrian subject may claim admission as a paying pupil, if the\r\nother conditions of admission are fulfilled in his case.\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Houses of Education there are only military or treasury\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nIn the Upper Houses of Education there are 1,800 military places; the\r\nremaining 600 are filled up by pupils upon provincial or private\r\nfoundations, and by paying pupils.\r\n\r\nIn the School Companies the number of the foundation places and paying\r\nplaces is not fixed.\r\n\r\nIn the Cadet Institutions and the Academies there are 900 full and 200\r\nhalf military places, and 520 places for pupils on provincial and\r\nprivate foundations, and for paying pupils.[6]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: Making a total of 1,620, to which may be added about\r\n    80, reserved for _Frequentanten_ from the School Companies.]\r\n\r\nA sum to cover the expenses is fixed in the case of the pupils on the\r\nprovincial and private foundations, as also for the paying pupils,\r\namounting in the Houses of Education and in the School Companies to 150\r\nflorins (15_l._) per annum; in the Cadet Houses to 400 florins (40_l._)\r\nper annum; in the Academies 600 florins (60_l._) for each of the three\r\nfirst years, and 800 florins (80_l._) for the last year. These payments\r\nwill be subject to modifications, at considerable intervals of time,\r\naccording to the price of articles of consumption, and will be drawn in\r\nthe case of the pupils on the provincial foundations from the funds of\r\nthe respective provinces, and in the case of the pupils of the private\r\nfoundations, from the moneys belonging to the private foundations.\r\n\r\nThe capital for the provincial and private foundations must be duly\r\nsecured and sufficient in amount to cover the fixed payments for the\r\nnumber of places determined upon. Supposing the sum contributed to be\r\ninsufficient, the requisite sums must be obtained by deferring any\r\nfurther nominations.[7] The proper sums in discharge of these\r\ncontributions must be paid in advance, half-yearly, on the 1st of\r\nOctober and the 1st of April. Those which belong to the provincial\r\nfoundations, and such private ones as are administered by trustees, must\r\nbe paid into the nearest Military Chest.[8] In the case of those pupils\r\nwho pay for themselves, the money must be sent precisely on the\r\nabove-mentioned days to the Commandant, or Director of the School,\r\nwithout reference to the day on which the pupil may have entered the\r\nschool. On the other hand, in cases where a pupil either is removed from\r\nor otherwise quits the institution before the natural time, restitution\r\nwill be made of the corresponding proportion of the sum paid in advance.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: The interest, that is, will be allowed to accumulate,\r\n    until a sufficient sum is provided to pay for the maintenance of a\r\n    pupil.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: Such as exist in most large towns.]\r\n\r\nFor admission into a Military Educational Institution, the boy must\r\nfirst of all be of the age specified for the institution in question,\r\nand must further possess the proper bodily growth and strength\r\ncorresponding to that age, and the prescribed amount of knowledge. Every\r\nboy who is to be offered as a candidate for a military place must first\r\nbe registered, and this in the course of the same year for which his\r\nadmission is desired. This registration must be made by the parents or\r\nguardians through the Commanding Officers of the Army,[9] or Army-Corps,\r\nor Military Government[10] within whose district they are domiciled, or\r\nin case of their living in foreign parts, through the Austrian Legation\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: There are four _Armies_; the First in the west, with\r\n    its head-quarters at Vienna; the Second in Italy, with its\r\n    head-quarters at Verona; and two others in the eastern provinces.\r\n    Each of these is divided into a certain number of Army Corps. The\r\n    particulars may be seen in Schematismus or Military Calendar, and\r\n    briefly in the Almanach de Gotha.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: In those parts of the Empire, namely, in the\r\n    so-called Military Frontiers, the old Turkish border, where the\r\n    government is simply military.]\r\n\r\nApplications thus made must state what is the institution, admission\r\ninto which is desired, and must be accompanied by the following\r\ncertificates:--1. Baptismal certificate. 2. Certificate of vaccination.\r\n3. Certificate of bodily health, by a Military Surgeon. 4. The school\r\ncertificate for the last half-yearly examination: And 5. On the reverse\r\nthe following declaration:--\r\n\r\n“I hereby pledge myself to surrender up my son (_or_ ward) to the\r\nImperial Military Service, in case of his being admitted into a Military\r\nEducational Institution; and I declare that I will under no pretext\r\nrequire his return.”\r\n\r\nThe object of this declaration is, on the one hand, to secure permanent\r\nelements for the Military Educational Institutions, and to create in the\r\nminds of the relations of the candidates the seriousness of purpose so\r\nessential in the choice of a profession. The declaration will also serve\r\nto retain the pupils to a course, which they have usefully commenced,\r\nand to protect them from the consequences of hasty decisions on the part\r\nof their friends. On the other hand, if it appears manifest that a pupil\r\nhas not the requisite inclination or qualification for the military\r\nservice, his removal from the institution ensues with or without the\r\nrequest of his friends, as will be more fully explained further on.\r\n\r\nThe applications will be examined by the Commanding Officers of the\r\nArmy, or the Army Corps, or Military Government, and after their\r\nrevision the candidates will be registered and the petitioners duly\r\ninformed.\r\n\r\nAny changes which occur in the case of the registered candidate, or in\r\nhis family circumstances, between the time of registration and of actual\r\nadmission, are to be made known to the authorities before whom the\r\napplication was brought.\r\n\r\nThe registers are to be submitted to the Supreme War Department in the\r\nmiddle of June, so that applications can be received by the Commanding\r\nOfficers of the Army, or Army Corps, or Military Government, at the\r\nutmost only up to the end of May.\r\n\r\nAppointments to the military places in the Houses of Education and the\r\nSchool Companies are made by the Supreme War Department; His Majesty the\r\nEmperor reserves for himself those in the Cadet Institutions and the\r\nAcademies.\r\n\r\nVacancies in the provincial foundation places are advertised, and\r\napplications called for, by the Governors or by the Standing Committees\r\nof the Estates of the respective provinces.[11]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: The Governor or Lord Lieutenant (the _Statthalter_)\r\n    is the ordinary representative of the Emperor in the various\r\n    provinces composing the Empire. In his hands resides the usual\r\n    administration of the government. The provinces have also their\r\n    ancient Estates or Parliaments, Standing Committees of which\r\n    might, under certain circumstances, sit at times when the Estates\r\n    were not assembled.]\r\n\r\nAll proposals made in this manner are forwarded to the Minister of the\r\nInterior, and submitted by him for the sanction of His Majesty.\r\n\r\nAppointments to the private foundations are made by the person specified\r\nby the founder; decisions of this kind are submitted on or before the\r\n15th of June, to the Supreme War Department for their approval of the\r\ncandidates and distribution of them into the various institutions.\r\n\r\nIf a candidate in whose case the prescribed conditions of admission are\r\nnot fulfilled is nominated to a private foundation, and his nomination\r\nconsequently not approved, a new nomination must be made.\r\n\r\nPupils who pay are appointed by the Supreme War Department.\r\n\r\nThe sanction of the appointments and the distribution of the candidates\r\nappointed in the various institutions, in the case of the military and\r\nthe paying pupils, will be made known to them by the Commanding Officers\r\nof the Army, or Army Corps, or Military Government; in the case of the\r\nprovincial foundations by the Minister of the Interior; and in the case\r\nof the private foundations by the trustees.\r\n\r\nCandidates living in a foreign country will be informed by the Legation\r\nin that country.\r\n\r\nUpon the appointment made to an entirely gratuitous place in a military\r\neducational institution, all payments of allowances for the education of\r\nchildren cease.[12]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: Small allowances, _e.g._ of 8_l._ for three years,\r\n    are very generally made to the widows of officers, and\r\n    occasionally to officers themselves, to assist them in securing a\r\n    decent education for their children.]\r\n\r\nThe conveyance of military foundation pupils to the school to which they\r\nare appointed will, if not provided for by the friends of the pupils, be\r\nmade at the expense of the Military Treasury by the ordinary means of\r\nlocomotion.\r\n\r\nTrustworthy Non-commissioned Officers from the nearest detachment of\r\ntroops should be selected by the military authorities for the conveyance\r\nand charge of the pupils; four or five being, according to the\r\ncircumstances, committed to the care of a single superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe conveyance of all other pupils must be provided for by their\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAdmission into the Military Educational Institutions takes place only at\r\nthe commencement of the school year. Candidates admitted must present\r\nthemselves in their respective institutions between the 15th and the\r\n30th of September.\r\n\r\nThe Commanding Officers of the Army, or Army Corps, or Military\r\nGovernment have to take care that every candidate admitted to a military\r\nplace shall, before leaving to join the institution, be a second time\r\nexamined by an Army Surgeon, and shall only be allowed to proceed to the\r\ninstitution in case of his bodily qualifications being found perfectly\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nFinally, the candidate upon presenting himself must be re-examined by\r\nthe chief Medical Officer of the institution, and if he is hereby found\r\nto be unqualified for military education, will not be received.[13]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: Thus, it will be seen, all candidates appointed to\r\n    the Military places in the schools are examined three times over\r\n    by a medical officer. Where the State does not pay, in the case of\r\n    provincial or private foundations, or of paying pupils, the same\r\n    amount of precaution is not thought necessary.]\r\n\r\nAny Military Surgeon or Medical Officer who incurs the guilt of neglect\r\nof his duty in this particular will be held responsible.\r\n\r\nEvery candidate upon presenting himself will moreover undergo the\r\nprescribed examination in his previous studies, and if his previous\r\neducation appears insufficient, his appointment will be cancelled.[14]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: The difficulties of traveling appear to be\r\n    considered in Austria too great to allow of any examination\r\n    (competitive or otherwise) before the candidates provisionally\r\n    admitted actually arrive at the school to which they are\r\n    appointed; if ill qualified, they are dismissed with the Chance of\r\n    a second trial.]\r\n\r\nPupils admitted after a private education into a Military Institution\r\nare provided by this institution with new linen, and clothes. All\r\nclothes they bring with them are without exception to be returned to\r\ntheir friends, and an acknowledgment of the return given.\r\n\r\nNo pupil in any of the Military Institutions is allowed to possess any\r\nlinen or clothes except what is provided; and the friends and relations\r\nare not to be called upon for any sort whatever of additional\r\ncontribution. An amount of pocket-money, varying with the character of\r\nthe institution, may be transmitted to the pupils through the hands of\r\nthe authorities of the school; but this is entirely at the pleasure of\r\nthe friends and relations; all necessaries being provided by the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nThe pocket-money can only be paid to the pupil through the Commanding\r\nOfficer of the Institution or of the Company.\r\n\r\nThe amount allowed must depend on the conduct of the pupil, but must\r\nnot, even in the Academies, exceed three florins (six shillings) a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction given in the Military Educational Institutions\r\nis fixed by special tables drawn up for each institution. Special\r\ntext-books, to be followed in the courses, are also appointed.\r\n\r\nThe tables drawn up to regulate the course of instruction are subject to\r\nsuch modifications as may be called for by the requirements of science\r\nand by improvements in the methods of teaching.\r\n\r\nThe scholars will also receive in the course of the year, more\r\nparticularly in summer, and after the close of the examination,\r\npractical instruction suitable to the arm of the service for which they\r\nare destined.\r\n\r\nEvery September the pupils pass into the next succeeding yearly course.\r\n\r\nIn the same month the scholars quit the institutions, and are either\r\nplaced in the army or transferred to other institutions. The conditions\r\nunder which this is done are given in detail in the account of each\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the conveyance of the pupils from one institution to\r\nanother are borne by the Treasury.\r\n\r\nPupils who make no progress in scientific studies will be required to\r\nenlist in the army[15] if old enough, and if not, will be removed to an\r\ninferior Military Educational Institution; or if they are already in one\r\nof the Houses of Education or School Companies, will be employed in\r\nlearning some trade which will be of use in the army,[16] and when they\r\nhave reached the proper age, will be enlisted.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: Will be _assentirt_, will take the oath. They are\r\n    considered old enough for this at sixteen.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Even clothes and shoes being made by soldiers; a\r\n    considerable number of soldiers were found thus employed, for\r\n    example, at the Artillery Academy at Olmütz, under the\r\n    superintendence of a master workman, bearing a non-commissioned\r\n    grade, that of a _prima-planist_, for whom, see a Note further\r\n    on.]\r\n\r\nPupils whose want of bodily qualification unfits them for the army will\r\nbe sent back to their parents or guardians. Those holding military\r\nplaces in the Academies, if their parents are entirely unable to provide\r\nfor them, will receive a yearly pension of 150 florins (15_l._) until\r\nthey can be placed in some employment under the State at a salary at\r\nleast equivalent to this sum.\r\n\r\nPupils out of the Military Houses of Education or School Companies, who\r\nare removed for want of bodily qualification, and whose parents are\r\nentirely unable to provide for them, will, according to their\r\ncapacities, be placed either in the Accounts Department[17] or some\r\nsimilar Military Department, in the Geographical Institution, or as\r\ndrummers or clerks in one of the higher Military Schools, or will be\r\ntaught some trade for employment in the Outfit Department,[18] or will\r\nbe made teachers. If, however, the pupil’s bodily disqualification be of\r\na nature to incapacitate him for any of the above-mentioned employments,\r\nhe will be removed at the expense of the Treasury into some Civil or\r\nMilitary Hospital.[19]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: _Militär Rechnungs Branche._]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: _Monturs Commission_, charged with the duty of\r\n    providing arms, clothing, &c., for the army. There are several\r\n    establishments in various parts of the Empire. One of the largest\r\n    is at Stockerau, near Vienna.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Into a _Siechen-haus_, a hospital for incurable\r\n    cases; or an _Invaliden-haus_, for _Invalídes_.]\r\n\r\nIf in moral respects a pupil is found to be a mischievous member of the\r\ninstitution, he may at any time in the course of any year be removed.\r\n\r\nPupils who pay, in case of their removal being found, for whatever\r\nreason, necessary, will be sent home to their friends, the consent of\r\nthe friends being required before they can be either engaged as soldiers\r\nor removed to one of the lower institutions. The expenses already\r\nincurred will be deducted from the payment made in advance, and the\r\nbalance repaid to the parents or guardians.\r\n\r\nA pupil who for whatever reason has once been removed from a Military\r\nSchool can never be afterwards admitted into any one of them, and in\r\ncase of his either then or afterwards enlisting in the army, he can not,\r\nunder any pretext whatever, obtain the rank of Officer before the pupils\r\nof the year to which he belonged. This rule, in the case of pupils who\r\nhave been transferred from a higher to a lower institution, even when\r\nthey pass out of this latter in the regular course, must be observed in\r\nreference to the pupils of the year to which they belonged in the\r\ninstitution from which they were removed.[20]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: A pupil who was removed from the Academy at Wiener\r\n    Neustadt might, for example, enter the army as a simple Cadet,\r\n    under the patronage of the Colonel of a regiment, and might, but\r\n    for this rule, receive rapid promotion, and become the senior in\r\n    rank of his comrades of the same year at the School. In like\r\n    manner, a pupil removed from a Cadet Institution and transferred\r\n    into a School Company, might, upon leaving that, under certain\r\n    circumstances, outstrip his late comrades at the Cadet\r\n    Institution.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA. SCHOOLS FOR NON-COMMISIONED OFFICERS\r\n\r\n1. _The Lower Military Houses of Education._\r\n\r\nThe twelve Lower Military Houses of Education contain, as has been said,\r\nonly military places.[21] These appertain, in the first instance, to the\r\nlegitimate sons of all soldiers bearing arms,[22] whether born in\r\nmarriage of the first, or in marriage of the second degree.[23]\r\nSubordinately to these, a lawful claim exists in the following cases:--\r\n\r\n  1. Sons of soldiers serving in the Trabant Body Guard, the Court\r\nWatch, the Outfit Commission, and other military bodies.[24]\r\n\r\n  2. Sons of fathers belonging to the Reserve,[25] without prejudice,\r\nhowever, to sons of soldiers in actual service.\r\n\r\n  3. Sons of invalided soldiers,[26] not only in cases where the father\r\nhas already married at the date of his reception as invalided, but also\r\nin those where marriage has been subsequently permitted.\r\n\r\n  4. Sons of those who have either as substitutes or otherwise served\r\ndouble time, and are now in the employment in connection with the Court\r\nor Government, even in cases where marriage has been contracted after\r\nquitting the service.\r\n\r\n  5. Sons of men belonging to the military service, not included in the\r\nabove-mentioned cases, namely, the sons of Prima-planists,[27] Employés,\r\nand Officers.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: That is, all the pupils are of military or\r\n    quasi-military birth, and the expense is borne by the State. Both\r\n    these and the Upper Military Houses are to be reduced, it is said,\r\n    to ten.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: The whole body (_Mannschaft_) of soldiers bearing\r\n    arms (_Feuergewehrstand_.)]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: Marriage of the first degree is that entered into\r\n    with full permission. In this the wives live in the barracks,\r\n    receive a certain amount of rations, their children are\r\n    recognized, and in case of the father’s death are admitted into\r\n    the Orphan Schools. Soldiers are, however, occasionally allowed\r\n    to marry, on condition of surrendering every claim to the\r\n    above-mentioned privileges. This constitutes marriage of the\r\n    second degree.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: The _Trabanten-Leibgarde_ and the _Hofburgwache_ are\r\n    Court troops. For the _Monturs Commission_, see a previous Note.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: Soldiers enlist for eight years, and after this to\r\n    the end of the tenth year are on the Reserve.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: That is, belonging to the Hospitals or Hotels des\r\n    Invalides, the _Invaliden-häuser_, of which there are several.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: Prima-planists, a name derived from _prima plana_,\r\n    the first leaf of the list, is given to soldiers employed in\r\n    various special duties, especially perhaps those not of a strictly\r\n    military kind. The master tailors, master shoemakers, master\r\n    farriers, are all _prima-planisten_. The surgeon’s assistant ranks\r\n    as such. The grade is superior to that of sergeant, but those who\r\n    hold it are excluded from promotion to a commission.]\r\n\r\nIn any large number of candidates special regard should be had to the\r\nsons of fathers who have been killed or invalided on the field; after\r\nthese, to those who are orphans on both sides; then to the sons of\r\nsubstitutes and other soldiers in actual services; and last follow in\r\norder the sons of fathers either belonging to the Reserve or received as\r\nInvalides, or otherwise connected with the Military Service.\r\n\r\nAs the sons of Officers serving with the sword[28] have a large number\r\nof places reserved for their benefit in the Cadet Institutions and the\r\nAcademies, their admission into Military Houses of Education, more\r\nespecially into the Lower House of Education, is only allowable when no\r\nprejudice is caused to the above-mentioned claimants, and as a general\r\nrule can only take place when they are orphans, or under special\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: This is a frequent phrase (_mit dem Degen dienende_)\r\n    for active service.]\r\n\r\nThe age of admission is the completion of the seventh year. Children\r\nunder this age who are orphans on both sides, or whose fathers being\r\nwidowers, have to serve in the field, will be received into the Orphan\r\nHouse at Vienna, and be transferred on completing their seventh year to\r\nthe Lower Houses of Education. Children who have passed the prescribed\r\nage for admission into the first class of the Lower Houses of Education\r\ncan only be admitted, in case of their possessing the requisite amount\r\nof knowledge, into the classes corresponding to their age, and in case\r\nof there being places vacant in these classes; any addition to the\r\nprescribed numbers in the respective years is not allowable.\r\n\r\nThe number of pupils in each of the Lower Houses of Education is fixed\r\nat 100. These 100 pupils are divided into four years, each year being as\r\nnearly as possible of the same numerical strength.\r\n\r\nThe command is held by a Subaltern Officer, to whom are attached for the\r\nreligious education, the medical care, the discipline, and the\r\ninstruction--\r\n\r\n  1 House Chaplain,\r\n  1 Army Surgeon,\r\n  4 Sergeants and Instructors,\r\n  4 Honorary Sergeants[29] as Assistant Instructors,\r\n  1 Sergeant, as House Adjutant; and\r\n  6 Corporals, for the discipline.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: _Feldwebel_, Sergeant; _qua Feldwebel_, Honorary\r\n    Sergeant, with the title and distinction in the uniform, but\r\n    without the pay.]\r\n\r\nAdditional assistance may be procured for managing the house and\r\nattending on the pupils.\r\n\r\nTo conduct the instruction (which will be almost entirely addressed\r\nimmediately to the senses of the children) class-teachers will be\r\nprovided for each yearly course; and these, with the house chaplain and\r\nthe medical officer, aided by assistant teachers, will give the pupils\r\ninstruction in the following subjects:--\r\n\r\n  1. Religious Knowledge. 2. German. 3. Natural History. 4. Geography.\r\n5. Arithmetic, both ordinary and mental. 6. Writing. 7. Common Drawing.\r\n8. First Notions of the Rules of Drill. 9. Gymnastic Exercises and\r\nSwimming.\r\n\r\n2. _Upper Military Houses of Education._\r\n\r\nThese, twelve in number, form a continuation to the Lower Houses of\r\nEducation, the pupils from which are admitted here at the close of their\r\neleventh year.\r\n\r\nAt this age foundation pupils of every kind, as also paying pupils, may\r\nbe admitted immediately from their parents’ homes, only, however, into\r\nthe first year’s course, and after passing an examination in the\r\nsubjects taught in the Lower Houses of Education, to the same extent up\r\nto which they are taught in the second class of the ordinary elementary\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe claim to a military place in an Upper House of Education, is similar\r\nto that for a military place in a Lower House of Education.\r\n\r\nThe number of pupils is fixed at 200 in each Upper House of Education,\r\ndivided in like manner into four yearly courses.\r\n\r\nThe command is intrusted to a Captain, who is aided, for purposes of\r\ninstruction and superintendence, by--\r\n\r\n  2 Subaltern Officers.\r\n  1 House Chaplain.\r\n  1 Army Surgeon.\r\n  1 Surgeon’s Assistant.\r\n  4 Sergeants as Teachers.\r\n  2 Honorary Sergeants as Assistant Teachers.\r\n  1 Sergeant as House Adjutant.\r\n  8 Corporals, for discipline.\r\n\r\nAdditional assistance may be procured for managing the house and for\r\nattendance, upon the same scale as in the Lower Houses.\r\n\r\nThe instruction, as in all the Military Schools to be noticed\r\nhenceforward, will be given by teachers specially assigned to each\r\nsubject, and will include here the following subjects:--\r\n\r\n  1. Religious Knowledge. 2. German, with written compositions. 3. One\r\nof the other Languages of the Empire. 4. Natural History. 5. Geography.\r\n6. History. 7. Arithmetic. 8. Military Rules and Regulations. 9. Rules\r\nof Drill, and first notions of the Rules of Military Exercise.\r\n10. Writing. 11. Common Drawing. 12. Gymnastic Exercises,\r\nSingle-stick,[30] Swimming.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: _Stock-fechten_, or staff-fencing; a sort of\r\n    military single-stick, the staff used resembling a musket and\r\n    bayonet in one piece, all of wood.]\r\n\r\nAfter completing their fourth year course, the pupils are transferred,\r\naccording to their qualifications and their own wishes, into the School\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\nEntrance into the Marine School Company takes place at the end of the\r\nsecond year’s course.\r\n\r\n3. _The School Companies._\r\n\r\nThe School Companies have the object of furnishing the different arms of\r\nthe service with Non-commissioned Officers well educated, both\r\npractically and theoretically, and likely in the course of time to prove\r\nuseful Commissioned Officers[31] in charge of the troops.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: _Truppen-Officiere_.]\r\n\r\nThey are in all twenty in number:--\r\n\r\n  6 for the Infantry.\r\n  3    “    Cavalry.\r\n  2 for the Frontier Troops.\r\n  5    “    Artillery.\r\n  1    “    Engineers.\r\n  1    “    Pioneers.\r\n  1    “    Flotilla.[32]\r\n  1    “    the Marine Service.[33]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: For service on the Lower Danube, the Po, and the\r\n    Italian Lakes and Lagoons.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: Both for service in the Fleet and in the Coast\r\n    Defenses.]\r\n\r\nUnder the general term of School Companies the School Squadrons (for the\r\nCavalry) are included. The term Scientific[34] School Companies applies\r\nonly to those of the Artillery, Engineers, Pioneers, Flotilla, and\r\nMarine.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: _Technische_, Technical or Artificer Companies.]\r\n\r\nThe scholars in the School Companies are either pupils or attendants[35]\r\nThe pupils are taken, as already described, from the Upper Houses of\r\nEducation, after the close of their fourth year’s course, (or, in the\r\ncase of the Marine School Company, after that of the second,) or they\r\ncome direct from places of private education.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 35: _Zöglinge_ and _Frequentanten_.]\r\n\r\nThe conditions for gratuitous admission from private educational\r\ninstitutions into the School Companies are similar to those for\r\nadmission into the Houses of Education, with the difference, that in the\r\nSchool Companies the sons of officials in the civil service, who have\r\nserved long and meritoriously, and are ill-provided for, may also claim\r\nmilitary places.\r\n\r\nThe candidates must be not under fifteen and not above eighteen years of\r\nage; in the Marine School Company not under thirteen and not above\r\nfourteen.\r\n\r\nThe Attendant pupils (_frequentanten_) come from the soldiers of the\r\nStanding Army.[36] They exist only in the School Companies of the\r\nArtillery, Engineers, Pioneers, and Flotilla; to be admissible, they\r\nmust, as a rule, have passed with credit through the Non-commissioned\r\nOfficer Schools of the Artillery or Engineer regiments, or of the\r\nPioneer Corps or Flotilla Corps; they must have been not more than two\r\nyears in the service; and not at the utmost be above the rank of an\r\nUpper Cannoneer, an Exempt, or an Upper Pioneer.[37]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: The _Mannschaft-stand_ is a term used to mean the\r\n    whole body of Private Soldiers and Non-commissioned Officers.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: The Non-commissioned Officers in the Austrian\r\n    service rank as follows:--\r\n\r\n      In the Infantry, Corporal, and Sergeant (_Feldwebel_:)\r\n      In the Cavalry, Corporal, and _Wachtmeister_:\r\n      In the Artillery, Corporal, and _Feuerwerker_:\r\n\r\n    But there are distinctions in addition. A private soldier who is\r\n    exempted from certain duties, e.g. from standing sentry, bears the\r\n    name of _Gefreite_, or Exempt, in the Infantry and in the\r\n    Engineers; the corresponding rank to which in the Artillery is an\r\n    Upper Cannoneer (_Ober-Canonier_,) and in the Pioneers, an Upper\r\n    Pioneer (_Ober-Pionier_.) These are in no case Non-commissioned\r\n    Officers, though in the way to become so. There are also\r\n    Vice-Corporals (Lance Corporals,) with the badge but without the\r\n    pay of Sergeants, and _qua Feldwebels_ or Honorary Sergeants, with\r\n    the badge but without the pay of Sergeants.]\r\n\r\nThe admission of Attendants (_frequentanten_) can only be allowed\r\nwithout prejudice to the claims of candidates from the Upper Military\r\nHouses of Education and from places of private education.\r\n\r\nPupils who come direct from private education must, if they propose to\r\nenter one of the Scientific School Companies, be at least 4 feet 10\r\ninches;[38] if one of the other School Companies, at least 4 feet 8\r\ninches high. And these and the Attendant pupils alike must at their\r\nentrance into the School Companies pass an examination in the subjects\r\nof instruction taught in the Upper Houses of Education.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 38: The Austrian foot or shoe (_schuh_) of 12 inches\r\n    (_zoll_) is a little longer than the English: 80 Austrian make 83\r\n    English.]\r\n\r\nA perfect knowledge of German is accordingly an indispensable condition\r\nfor reception into the School Companies, and can only in the single case\r\nof the Marine School Company be under certain circumstances overlooked.\r\n\r\nAt his entrance into the School Company every pupil takes the military\r\noath, and is from this day bound to eight years’ service in the Standing\r\nArmy, and two years’ service in the Reserve.\r\n\r\nEach School Company is commanded by a Captain; each School Squadron by a\r\nCaptain of Cavalry.\r\n\r\nThey have attached to them for purposes of instruction and discipline,--\r\n\r\n  In each Infantry School Company,      3 Subaltern Officers\r\n    “     School Squadron,              3          “\r\n    “     Frontier School Company,      6          “\r\n    “     Artillery      “              6          “\r\n  In the Engineer        “              6          “\r\n    “     Pioneer        “              6          “\r\n    “     Flotilla       “              4          “\r\n    “     Naval          “              4          “\r\n\r\nEach institution is provided also with four Sergeants as teachers,\r\ntogether with a requisite number of additional persons required for\r\nmanagement, discipline, and service.\r\n\r\nReligious superintendence and instruction is intrusted to a local\r\nEcclesiastic, and the medical duties to an Army Surgeon.\r\n\r\nScholars in the School Companies are to receive a practical as well as a\r\ntheoretical training. This is to be regulated according to the branch of\r\nthe service for which they are detained.\r\n\r\nEach of the Infantry School Companies consists of 120 pupils, divided\r\ninto two years, the subjects of instruction being--\r\n\r\n  1. Religious Knowledge. 2. One of the National Languages. 3. Geography\r\nand History of the Austrian State. 4. Arithmetic. 5. Elements of\r\nGeometry. 6. Military Correspondence and Management of the Internal\r\nAffairs of a Company.[39] 7. Pioneer Service.[40] 8. Knowledge of the\r\nArms of the Infantry. 9. Rules and Regulations. 10. Rules of Drill,\r\nExercise, and Manœuvring. 11. Calligraphy. 12. Military Drawing.\r\n13. Gymnastics, Fencing, and Swimming.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 39: _Manipulation._ See the account of the visits to the\r\n    School Companies.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 40: This includes pontooning.]\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the course the pupils who have done remarkably well\r\nenter the Infantry as Corporals, the pupils who have done well as\r\nExempts, with the corporal’s badge; those who have done moderately, as\r\nExempts; and those who have done either remarkably well, or well, will\r\nbe, without further examination, named as Cadets[41] as soon as they pay\r\ndown the sum required for outfit, or prove their legitimate claim to\r\nexemption from this outlay, they themselves being consenting parties.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 41: Cadets in a regiment, _i.e._ candidates for a\r\n    commission, like those appointed on the nomination of the\r\n    colonels.]\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of the School Squadrons, with a number of 60 pupils in\r\neach, are analogous to those of the School Companies, special attention\r\nonly being given to instruction in riding and practical exercise in the\r\nCavalry service; for which purpose each Squadron is provided with 71\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nThe first of the School Squadrons forms a Regiment of Dragoons, the\r\nsecond one of Lancers, and the third one of Hussars.\r\n\r\nThe subjects taught are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1. Religious Knowledge. 2. One of the National Languages.\r\n3. Arithmetic. 4. Elements of Geometry. 5. Geography and History of\r\nAustria. 6. Military Correspondence, and Management of the Internal\r\nAffairs of a Squadron. 7. Knowledge of Cavalry Arms. 8. Rules and\r\nRegulations. 9. Rules of Cavalry Drill, Exercise, and Manœuvring.\r\n10. Knowledge of Horses and Grooming, of Bridling, Saddling, and\r\nShoeing. 11. Calligraphy. 12. Military Drawing. 13. Riding.\r\n14. Gymnastics, Fencing, and Swimming.\r\n\r\nOn leaving, the pupils enter the Cavalry in the grades corresponding to\r\nthose mentioned above for the Infantry.\r\n\r\nThe Frontier School Companies, each of 120 pupils, give three yearly\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\nIn all essential points, these institutions are organized on the same\r\nplan with the Infantry School Companies. As, however, Officers and\r\nNon-commissioned Officers on the Military Frontiers are also intrusted\r\nwith the general administration, and accordingly require of necessity a\r\nknowledge of political administration, of jurisprudence, and\r\nagriculture, the range of the plan of study in the Frontier School\r\nCompanies is more extensive.\r\n\r\nThe following subjects are taught:--\r\n\r\n  1. Religious Knowledge. 2. The Wallachian or Illyrian Language.\r\n3. Austrian Geography and History. 4. Arithmetic and Algebra.\r\n5. Geometry, Plane Trigonometry, and Practical Mensuration. 6. Military\r\nCorrespondence and Management of the Internal Affairs of a Company.\r\n7. Arms and Munitions. 8. Pioneer Service, Road and Bridge Making.\r\n9. Elements of Civil Architecture. 10. Agriculture. 11. Frontier Law and\r\nAdministration. 12. Rules and Regulations. 13. Rules of Drill, Exercise,\r\nand Manœuvring. 14. Calligraphy. 15. Military Drawing. 16. Gymnastics,\r\nFencing, Swimming.\r\n\r\nThe pupils of the Frontier School Companies, at the close of their third\r\nyear, enter the Frontier Troops, under the conditions already stated in\r\nthe case of the Infantry School Companies.\r\n\r\nThe Artillery School Companies have a course of three years, and consist\r\neach of 120 scholars (pupils and attendant pupils.)\r\n\r\nThe subjects of study are--\r\n\r\n  1.

The subjects taught are--\r\n\r\n  1. Religious Knowledge. 2. Austrian History and Geography.\r\n3. Arithmetic and Algebra. 4. Geometry, Plane Trigonometry, Practical\r\nMensuration. 5. Military Correspondence and Management of the Internal\r\nAffairs of a Company. 6. Pioneer Service. 7. Sapping and Mining.\r\n8. Elements of Permanent Fortification. 9. Civil Architecture. 10. Arms\r\nand Munitions. 11. Rules and Regulations. 12. Rules of Drill, Exercise,\r\nand Manœuvring. 13. Calligraphy. 14. Military Drawing. 15. Architectural\r\nDrawing. 16. Gymnastics, Fencing, Swimming.\r\n\r\nThe scholars enter the Corps of Engineers in the same way as has been\r\ndescribed in the case of the other School Companies; the most\r\ndistinguished passing as Attendant Pupils with the rank of\r\nLance-Corporals, free of cost, into the Academy of Engineers.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer School Company also contains 120 scholars, similarly divided\r\ninto three yearly courses.\r\n\r\nThe instruction given is similar to that of the Engineer School Company,\r\nspecial attention being paid to pioneering duties.\r\n\r\n  1.

Scholars who\r\nspecially distinguish themselves will at the close of the second year be\r\nreceived, free of cost, as Attendant Pupils (_frequentanten_) in the\r\nAcademy of Engineers; and after completing the four years’ course there,\r\nbe distributed as Officers in the Corps of Pioneers.\r\n\r\nThe number of scholars in the Flotilla School Company is 60; and the\r\ncourse of instruction three years in length. The subjects are--\r\n\r\n  1. Religious Knowledge. 2. Italian. 3. Austrian History and Geography.\r\n4. Arithmetic and Algebra. 5. Geometry, Plane Trigonometry, Practical\r\nMensuration. 6. Popular Mechanics. 7. Military Correspondence, and\r\nManagement of the Internal Affairs of a Company. 8, 9, 10. Flotilla\r\nNavigation, Artillery, and Pioneering. 11. Rules and Regulations.\r\n12. Rules of Drill, Exercise, and Manœuvring. 13. Calligraphy.\r\n14. Military Drawing. 15. Elements of Descriptive Geometry.\r\n16. Gymnastics, Fencing, Swimming, and Boating.\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished scholars are sent, free of charge, at the end of\r\nthe second year, to the Artillery Academy, and after completing the four\r\nyears there, enter the Flotilla Corps as Officers. The others leave at\r\nthe end of three years under conditions similar to those already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe Marine School Company contains 150 pupils, and its course of\r\ninstruction lasts four years.\r\n\r\nThe subjects are--\r\n\r\n  1. Religious Knowledge. 2. German. 3. Italian. 4.

The Marine Artillery and the\r\n    Engineering pupils (_Maschinen-lehrlinge_) serve on board.]\r\n\r\nThe best scholars enter after four years instruction as Attendant Pupils\r\nin the Artillery Academy, and after completing their time there are\r\nadmitted as Second Lieutenants of the second class into the Marine\r\nArtillery.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. SCHOOLS FOR OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n1. _The Cadet Institutions._\r\n\r\nThe object of these is to prepare pupils for the instruction in military\r\nscience given in the Academies.\r\n\r\nThey are four in number, with 200 pupils in each.\r\n\r\nThey contain military or treasury places, either wholly or half\r\ngratuitous; places on provincial and private foundations; and finally\r\nplaces for paying pupils.\r\n\r\nThe exact number of places open to pupils on provincial and private\r\nfoundations, and to paying pupils, can not be determined, as in this\r\nrespect the Cadet Schools form a single whole with the Academies, and\r\nthe amount can only be fixed as a total for these institutions taken\r\ntogether. There are altogether 1,100 of these military places, which may\r\nbe distributed in varying proportions amongst the Cadet Schools and the\r\nAcademies; the number in any one of them can not be stated as a rule.\r\n\r\nThe military foundations are reserved for the sons of Officers serving\r\nor having served with the sword; the entirely gratuitous places for the\r\nsons of Officers in want, and the half gratuitous places for those of\r\nOfficers provided with means of their own, or serving in higher\r\npositions.\r\n\r\nOfficers employed in the Outfit Department, Remounting[45] Department,\r\nthe Department of Military Law and Jurisdiction[46] are thus excluded,\r\nunless they have previously served with the sword. But for the sons of\r\nthese Officers, of the Military Judges, the Military Surgeons, and other\r\nOfficials, having attained the eleventh or any higher allowance\r\nclass,[47] there will be reserved eight entirely and eight half\r\ngratuitous places in the Cadet Schools and the Academies.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 45: For the Outfit Department (_Monturs Commission_,)\r\n    see a previous Note. The business of the Remounting Department or\r\n    Remounting Establishments (_Remontirungs Anstalten_) is to supply\r\n    the cavalry with horses. There are several of these great\r\n    establishments for buying and breeding horses; the largest of all\r\n    is in Gallicia.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 46: _Auditoriat._--There is an _Auditor_ or Military\r\n    Judge in each regiment. He has passed through his course as a law\r\n    student, and declared for this branch. In every province there is\r\n    a central department. These law officials rise through all the\r\n    grades from Lieutenant up to General.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 47: One of the marks of superior rank is the amount\r\n    granted for _allowances_, for which there is a carefully graduated\r\n    scale.]\r\n\r\nAppointments to the military and provincial foundations are granted by\r\nHis Majesty, the former on the recommendation of the Supreme War\r\nDepartment, the latter on that of the Minister of the Interior. Among\r\nthe former are included, as already stated, the most distinguished\r\npupils of the Lower Houses of Education, for whose transfer to the Cadet\r\nSchools the rules are laid down, the recommendation being annually\r\nsubmitted for His Majesty’s approval.\r\n\r\nSpecial regard will be given to candidates whose fathers have been\r\nkilled or invalided in the field; after these, to those who are orphans\r\non both sides; to the sons of Officers of special merit, of Officers\r\nwith large families, and the like.\r\n\r\nAppointments upon provincial and private foundations, or as paying\r\npupils, will be made in the manner already stated in the general account\r\nof the Educational Institutions.\r\n\r\nThe age of admission is the eleventh year completed, and twelfth year\r\nnot exceeded, and the candidate will be expected to know the subject of\r\ninstruction prescribed for the third class of the common (_normal_)\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of German, however, will not be considered indispensable.\r\nPupils who are not Germans will receive in the first half year of the\r\nfirst course special instruction in German.\r\n\r\nThe instruction continues during four yearly courses. The command is\r\nheld by a Field Officer, assisted by--\r\n\r\n   1 Subaltern Officer as Adjutant.\r\n   2 Captains.\r\n  10 Subaltern Officers.\r\n   2 Ecclesiastical Professors.\r\n   1 Accountant.\r\n   1 Army Surgeon.\r\n   1 Surgeon’s Assistant.\r\n  12 Sergeants for Inspection.\r\n   4 Orderlies, together with the requisite number of mechanics\r\n     and servants.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of instruction are--\r\n\r\n  1. Religious Knowledge. 2. German Language and Art of Speaking.\r\n3. French. 4. Natural History. 5. Geography. 6. History. 7. Arithmetic.\r\n8. Algebra. 9. Geometry and Plane Trigonometry. 10. Rules of Drill and\r\nExercise. 11. Calligraphy. 12. Common Drawing. 13. Gymnastics,\r\nSingle-stick, Swimming.\r\n\r\nThose pupils who satisfactorily complete their four years’ course are\r\ntransferred, according to their capacities, and as far as possible, to\r\ntheir own wishes, into one of the Military Academies. Entrance into the\r\nMarine Academy takes place at the close of the second year.\r\n\r\nPupils who do ill, will, at the close of any one of the three first\r\nyears, be removed into the course of the following year at one of the\r\nUpper Houses of Education; or, at the close of the fourth year, into one\r\nof the Infantry School Companies.\r\n\r\nThis removal, in the case of paying pupils, will be dependent on the\r\nconsent of the parents; failing which, they will be sent back home.\r\n\r\n2. _The Military Academies._\r\n\r\nThe object in these is to educate Officers in the higher military\r\nsubjects for the different arms of the service.\r\n\r\nThere are four Academies; the Neustadt Academy, the Artillery Academy,\r\nthe Engineers’ Academy, and the Marine Academy.\r\n\r\nThe scholars in each are divided into four yearly courses of nearly\r\nequal numbers. In the Neustadt Academy each year is sub-divided into two\r\nparallel classes, the instruction being the same in both.\r\n\r\nThe pupils in the Military Academies are of the different kinds\r\ndescribed in the account of the Cadet Houses, and the appointments\r\nsimilarly made; the Academies and the Cadet Houses in these respects\r\nforming a single body.\r\n\r\nCandidates for admission into the Neustadt Academy, the Artillery\r\nAcademy, or the Engineers’ Academy, must be nearly, if not quite,\r\nfifteen, and not above sixteen years old. For admission into the Marine\r\nAcademy, they must be nearly, if not quite, thirteen, not above fourteen\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nThe Academies receive their pupils in the first instance from the Cadet\r\nSchools, after the satisfactory completion of the fourth (or, in the\r\ncase of the Marine Academy, the second) year, and then, as already\r\nstated under the head of the School Companies, from the Artillery School\r\nCompanies, and from the Engineer, Pioneer, Flotilla, and Marine School\r\nCompanies, after the highly satisfactory completion of the second\r\n(or, in the Marine School, of the fourth) year.\r\n\r\nPupils from these School Companies, before entering the Academies, will\r\ntake the Military Oath, receive the rank of Lance-Corporals, and be\r\nadmitted free of charge as Attendant Pupils into the Academies, to\r\nreceive their education for the rank of Officer. Scholars from the\r\ngeneral body of soldiers, who are attending the School Companies, are to\r\nbe treated, in respect of their transfer to the Academies, in the same\r\nway as the other pupils.[48]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 48: In the School Companies there are two different sets\r\n    of Scholars, those who have come from the Houses of Education or\r\n    from private schools, and those who _attend_ after two years’\r\n    service in the Army. These are _frequentanten_ in the School\r\n    Companies, but all alike, who come from the School Companies, are\r\n    _frequentanten_ in the Academies.]\r\n\r\nEntrance into the Academies is confined to the commencement of the first\r\nyear.[49] Pupils admitted from places of private instruction are\r\nexamined in the subjects taught in the Cadet Schools; those who wish to\r\nenter the Neustadt, the Artillery or Engineers’ Academy, in the\r\nfollowing subjects, to the extent here described:--\r\n\r\n  1. German:--The Art of Speaking; Prosody; the Rules of Speaking;\r\n     the various Rhetorical Styles.\r\n  2. Natural History:--General knowledge of the Three Kingdoms.\r\n  3. French:--General grammatical rules; Translation from German\r\n     into French.\r\n  4. Geography.\r\n  5. History:--Ancient and of the Middle Ages.\r\n  6. Geometry and Rectilinear Trigonometry, with the Application\r\n     of Algebra, and the Solution of Geometrical Problems.\r\n  7. Common Drawing.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 49: It appears, however, that a transfer of pupils, for\r\n    example, from the Engineers’ Academy to Wiener Neustadt, in\r\n    consequence of incapacity for Mathematics, is allowed at a later\r\n    standing. After passing a year at Znaim, a young man may enter the\r\n    second year’s course at Neustadt.]\r\n\r\nCandidates for the Marine Academy will be required to know,--\r\n\r\n  1. The German Grammar, including Syntax.\r\n  2. Zoölogy.\r\n  3. French:--The Auxiliary Verbs; the Four Conjugations; Reading.\r\n  4. General Geography.\r\n  5. Ancient History.\r\n  6. Arithmetic and Algebra as far (inclusively) as Equations of\r\n     the First Degree, with two unknown Quantities.\r\n  7. Common Drawing.\r\n\r\nCandidates from both institutions must also possess the degree of\r\nreligious knowledge corresponding to their age, and must write a good\r\ncurrent hand.\r\n\r\nPupils who are found negligent in the course of their academical\r\nstudies, will at the close of the first, second, or third year be\r\ntransferred to the classes corresponding to their age in the School\r\nCompanies, or will be enlisted in the Army as Cadets if they possess the\r\nrequisite bodily qualifications, in the manner already described.[50]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 50: The wishes of the parents are, of course, consulted\r\n    in the case of paying pupils, but it is said that their consent is\r\n    very generally given.]\r\n\r\n_The Neustadt Academy._\r\n\r\nWiener Neustadt having been the seat of this Academy for more than a\r\ncentury, the ancient name thence derived will be retained in its usual\r\nacceptation, though the Academies for the Artillery and the Engineers\r\nwill also be placed in the same locality. The institution counts 400\r\npupils, designed primarily for the Infantry of the Line and of the\r\nFrontier, and secondly, for the Chasseurs and the Cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe Director of the Academy is a Colonel or General, attached to whom,\r\nfor purposes of instruction, discipline, and general management, there\r\nare three field and thirty-four other Officers; for religious care and\r\ninstruction, four Ecclesiastics; for medical attention, one Regimental\r\nSurgeon, one Army Surgeon, and one Surgeon’s Assistant; for the\r\naccounts, one Accountant, and four Accountant’s Assistants. The large\r\nnumber of pupils maintained in the institution requires, moreover, a\r\nproportionately large staff for superintendence, a numerous body of\r\nattendants, servants, and the like; so that the whole number to be added\r\nto that of the pupils does not fall short of 309 persons; 64 horses are\r\nallowed for the riding lessons.\r\n\r\nThe plan of study is based on that of the Cadet Schools, and embraces\r\nthe following subjects:--\r\n\r\n  1.

Only in the case of the pupils who wish to\r\nenter the Cavalry, the parents (or guardians) will be called upon to\r\ngive security for the payment of 1,000 florins (100_l._) towards the\r\nexpenses of the first equipment, and for a monthly allowance of 25\r\nflorins (2_l._ 10_s._)\r\n\r\n3. _The Artillery and Engineers’ Academy._\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of these two Academies are in many respects similar, as\r\nrequired by the character of the two kindred sciences for which they are\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\nThe number of scholars is fixed at 160 pupils, and 40 attendant pupils\r\n(_Frequentanten_) in each.\r\n\r\nThe command in each is intrusted to a General or a Colonel.\r\n\r\nFor the smaller number of scholars, fewer instructors, superintendents,\r\nand attendants are needed; the complete amount in each Academy is fixed\r\nat 200 men, in addition to the scholars. Each has thirty-two horses\r\nallowed to it.\r\n\r\nThe plan of instruction is in many respects identical in each.\r\n\r\nThe subjects taught in both are--\r\n\r\n  1. Religious Knowledge. 2. French. 3. Italian.[52] 4. Logic and\r\nPsychology. 5. Geography. 6. History. 7. Analytical Geometry and Higher\r\nAnalytical Mathematics. 8. Descriptive Geometry. 9. Mechanics and the\r\nElements of the Study of Machinery. 10. Mathematical Geography.\r\n11. Natural Philosophy and Chemistry. 12. Practical Mensuration, taking\r\nPlans at Sight. 13. Military Composition. 14. International Law;\r\nAustrian Civil Law. 15. Military Penal Law and Penal Procedure.\r\n16. Military Drawing; Study of Ground and Positions. 17. Rules and\r\nRegulations, and Military Administration. 18. Riding. 19. Gymnastics.\r\n20. Fencing. 21. Dancing. 22. Swimming.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 52: This is at present, in point of fact, omitted for\r\n    want of time.]\r\n\r\nCommon drawing will be treated, as it is at the Neustadt Academy, as an\r\noptional subject.\r\n\r\nIn the Artillery Academy the following additional subjects will be\r\ntaught;--\r\n\r\n  1. Bohemian.[53] 2. Field Fortification and Permanent Fortification.\r\n3. Tactics of the Three Arms. 4. Artillery. 5. Sieges, Construction of\r\nBatteries; Artillery. 6. Rockets. 7. Rules of Drill and Exercise in the\r\nArtillery and Infantry. 8. Instruction in shoeing horses, in judging of\r\ntheir Age, in judging of them at Sight, in Bridling, Saddling, and\r\nGrooming.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 53: The Artillery is recruited very largely from Bohemia\r\n    and Moravia. A knowledge of the Bohemian language (which is pretty\r\n    nearly the same as Moravian) is therefore essential for an Officer\r\n    in the command of Artillerymen.]\r\n\r\nIn the Academy of the Engineers the additional subjects are--\r\n\r\n  1. Arms and Munitions and Artillery. 2. Art of Fortification.\r\n3, 4. Civil Architecture, Plain and Ornamental. 5. Pioneer Service.\r\n6. Rules of Drill, Exercise, and Manœuvring.\r\n\r\nThe pupils of the two Academies enter in the same way as those at\r\nNeustadt, after the satisfactory completion of four years’ instruction,\r\nwith the rank of Second Lieutenant of the Second Class, the respective\r\nservices of the Artillery, and of the Engineers or Pioneers. Pupils for\r\nwhom no vacancies can be found enter the Infantry.\r\n\r\n4. _The Marine Academy._\r\n\r\nThis, like the other Academies, is in the charge of a Field Officer, or\r\na General.\r\n\r\nThe pupils are 100 in number; the Teachers, other Officers, and\r\nattendants, 88.\r\n\r\nOne essential distinction here (explained by the necessity of\r\nhabituating the pupils to the sea) is the admission at an age earlier by\r\ntwo years, and the proportionally earlier termination of the course.\r\n\r\nThe plan of instruction combines a continuation of the studies\r\nprescribed in the Cadet Schools, with the commencement of those\r\nspecially required for the marine service, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  1. Religious Knowledge. 2. German. 3. Italian. 4. French. 5. English.\r\n6. Geography. 7. History. 8. Algebra. 9. Geometry and Plane\r\nTrigonometry. 10. Analytical Geometry and Higher Analytical Mathematics.\r\n11. Spherical Trigonometry and Nautical Astronomy. 12. Mechanics and\r\nNatural Philosophy. 13. Descriptive Geometry. 14. Navigation.\r\n15. Military Composition. 16. International Law, Austrian Civil Law, Sea\r\nLaw. 17. Military Penal Law, and Penal Procedure. 18. Artillery.\r\n19. Fortification, Attack and Defense of Coast Fortifications. 20. Naval\r\nTactics and Naval History. 21. Knowledge of Rigging, &c.\r\n(_Takelungslehre._) 22. Naval Manœuvres. 23. Naval Architecture.\r\n24. Signals. 25. Rules and Regulations. 26. Rules of Drill and Exercise.\r\n27. Calligraphy. 28. Military Drawing. 29. Common Drawing. 30. Swimming.\r\n31. Gymnastics. 32. Fencing. 33. Dancing.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the practical instruction given in the course of the\r\nschool year, the pupils of the three first years will in the months of\r\nAugust and September be sent in sailing vessels on a voyage for\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe pupils at the end of four years enter as Cadets into the Navy, the\r\nFlotilla Corps, or the Corps of Naval Architecture.\r\n\r\nAfter completing a practical course of two years, they will receive\r\ntheir promotion as Second Lieutenants of the second class.[54]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 54: Literally, “as _Frigate-Ensign_, or Second\r\n    Lieutenant of the second class,” the former being in rank the same\r\n    as the latter. The order of rank is,--\r\n\r\n      Captain    of a Man-of-War equal to a Colonel in the Army.\r\n         “       of a Frigate      “        Lieutenant Colonel ditto.\r\n         “       of a Corvette     “        Major ditto.\r\n      Lieutenant of a Man-of-War   “        First Captain ditto.\r\n         “       of a Frigate      “        Second Captain ditto.\r\n      Ensign in a Man-of-War       “        First Lieutenant ditto.\r\n         “   in a Frigate          “        Second Lieutenant ditto.\r\n\r\n    In the Corps of Naval Architecture the ordinary military titles\r\n    are used.]\r\n\r\n\r\nC. SPECIAL SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n1. _The Military Teachers’ School._\r\n\r\nThe object here is a double one; first, to bring up good and serviceable\r\nteachers in the subjects of study prescribed for the Military Houses of\r\nEducation; secondly to provide at the same time instructors in\r\ngymnastics and fencing for all the military schools and for the troops.\r\nThe institution accordingly consists of two departments, each of thirty\r\nAttendant Pupils, receiving instruction in these two different branches.\r\n\r\nNon-commissioned Officers are admitted after a service of at least two\r\nyears. Candidates for admission into the Teachers’ department must, in\r\naddition, possess the required amount of knowledge in the subjects\r\ntaught in the Military Houses of Education; and, as a rule, must know,\r\nbesides German, one other of the Austrian national languages.\r\nProficiency in every one of the subjects will not be considered\r\nessential. Candidates for admission to the Gymnastic and Fencing\r\nDepartment will be required to show a certain amount of readiness in the\r\nuse of arms and in gymnastic exercises, and an evident capacity for\r\nacquiring greater skill.\r\n\r\nRegistration for admission is to be obtained in the usual course of the\r\nservice from the Supreme War Department.\r\n\r\nThe Attendant Pupils receive, in addition to their ordinary pay, bread\r\nand the extra allowance; and for their better subsistence also an\r\nallowance corresponding to that granted for provision during a march.\r\n\r\nThe command is held by a Field Officer or Captain; six Subaltern\r\nOfficers and four Sergeants act as teachers, the latter as assistants in\r\nthe instruction in fencing and gymnastics, and as swimming master. The\r\ninstructor in the art and methods of teaching may be a civilian.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of instruction in the Teachers’ Department are--\r\n\r\n  1. The Art and Methods of Teaching. 2. German. 3. Another Austrian\r\nLanguage. 4. Arithmetic and Geometry. 5. Geography. 6. Military\r\nComposition, and the Management of the Internal Affairs of a Company.\r\n7. Calligraphy. 8. Common and Military Drawing. 9. Gymnastics, Fencing,\r\nand Swimming.\r\n\r\nIn the Gymnastic Department,--\r\n\r\n  1. Staff, Rapier, Sword, and Bayonet Fencing. 2. Gymnastics and\r\nSwimming. 3. Knowledge of Fire-arms.\r\n\r\nIn both Departments a certain number of hours weekly will be devoted to\r\nMilitary Exercise.\r\n\r\nInstruction in all the subjects will be given with special reference to\r\nthe methods to be pursued in teaching them in the various Military\r\nSchools.\r\n\r\nThe course in each Department lasts one year. Under certain\r\ncircumstances particular pupils in the Teachers’ Department may remain\r\nfor the further completion of their studies a second year in the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nIn the Teachers’ Department, pupils who show no aptitude or liking for\r\nsome particular subject, may be exempted from attending the lessons\r\ngiven in it, so as to allow them to give more thorough attention to\r\nother branches.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the examination, the pupils are either sent immediately to\r\nundertake duty in the Military Schools, or return to their service in\r\nthe troops, and pass, as occasion requires, into the Military Schools.\r\nCorporals who distinguish themselves by remarkably good progress will be\r\npromoted to the rank of Sergeant.\r\n\r\n2. _The United Higher Course for the Artillery and Engineers_,\r\n\r\nHas for its object the more advanced instruction of young Officers in a\r\nscientific and technical point of view, for service in the Artillery and\r\nEngineers.\r\n\r\nTwenty Officers, of more than usual capacity, between twenty-one and\r\ntwenty-six years of age, will be admitted from each of the two arms.\r\nThey must be unmarried, and must have served with distinction during a\r\nperiod of not less than two years.\r\n\r\nOfficers in whose cases these conditions are satisfied, and who desire\r\nto be admitted to the course, apply for registration for admission to\r\nthe examination, in the ordinary form, to the War Department.\r\n\r\nOfficers who, in the month of October, are summoned to attend, may\r\ncharge their traveling expenses to the Treasury, and undergo an\r\nexamination before the Professors attached to the Course, in the\r\nfollowing subjects:--\r\n\r\n  1. Analytical Geometry and Higher Analytical Mathematics. 2. Mechanics\r\nand the Elements of the Study of Machinery. 3. Natural Philosophy and\r\nChemistry. 4 Military Composition. 5. French. 6. Military Drawing,\r\ntested by the production of a Drawing of their own doing.\r\n\r\nCandidates for the Artillery will be, moreover, examined in the Tactics\r\nof the three Arms, and in Artillery; and those from the Engineers, in\r\nthe Art of Fortification and in Civil Architecture, both Plain and\r\nOrnamental.\r\n\r\nThe text-books used in the Academies of the Artillery and Engineers will\r\nserve as a measure for the range of attainment required. Pupils who\r\npassed with distinction through these Academies will thus be specially\r\nfitted for admission into the Higher Course after they have proved,\r\nduring their time of service, their diligence in bringing the knowledge\r\nthey have acquired into actual application.\r\n\r\nOn the close of this preliminary examination, the results will be\r\nsubmitted to the Supreme War Department, and the recommendations for\r\nadmission laid before His Majesty.\r\n\r\nA superior Field Officer, either of the Artillery or the Engineers, will\r\nbe intrusted with the charge of the united course. The lectures will be\r\ngiven by the Professors of the Academy of the Artillery and Engineers.\r\nFrom the nature of the duties, partly common and partly distinct, which\r\ndevolve upon the two corps, it follows that the course of the studies\r\n(which will be carried on during two years) will in like manner be\r\npartly common and partly separate.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of common instruction will be--\r\n\r\n  1. Mechanics in application to Machinery, combined with Machine\r\nDrawing. 2. Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, combined with practice in\r\nmanipulation, in making experiments, and in analyzing. 3. Theory of\r\nArtillery, in reference to the constructions that occur in Artillery.\r\n4. Higher Tactics. 5. Principles of Strategy, illustrated by the\r\nrepresentation of campaigns, with special attention to the use of\r\nArtillery, as well in Attack and Defense of fortified places, as in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nSeparate instruction will be given to Artillery Officers in--\r\n\r\n  1. Service in Workshops, Depôts, and Arsenals. 2. Knowledge of Foreign\r\nArtillery, of the requisites (_ausrüstungen_) for Field service and\r\nSieges, and for furnishing fortified places.\r\n\r\nTo Engineer Officers, in--\r\n\r\n  1. Ornamental Architecture, combined with Architectural Drawing.\r\n2. The Art of Fortification, special attention being given to working\r\nout projects.\r\n\r\nThe pupils receive in addition practical guidance and supervision in all\r\nsubjects of a scientific nature connected with the Art of War.\r\n\r\nThe pupils of the second year undergo an examination in October. Upon\r\nthe results of the examination the War Department decides on their\r\npromotion for the rank of Second to that of First Lieutenants.\r\n\r\n3. _The War or Staff School._\r\n\r\nThe object of the War School is to give Officers of all arms an\r\neducation for higher duties, especially for those of the Staff and of\r\nthe Upper Adjutant Department.[55]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 55: The Higher _Adjutantur_ or the Aide-de-Camp\r\n    Department.]\r\n\r\nAny Subaltern Officer of the active army, without distinction of arms,\r\nmay claim admission into the War School, provided he is above twenty-one\r\nand under twenty-six years old, is unmarried, and has served as Officer\r\nuninterruptedly and with distinction two years at least with the troops,\r\nand, provided, finally, he has passed the prescribed preliminary\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nFor admission to the examination, registration, to be obtained in the\r\nusual form from the War Department, is requisite.\r\n\r\nThe examination is conducted between October 10th and 20th, in the War\r\nSchool buildings; the registered candidates will be summoned to Vienna\r\nat the beginning of October; traveling expenses will be paid by the\r\nTreasury. The subjects are--\r\n\r\n  1. Algebra and Geometry, including Plane and Spherical Trigonometry.\r\n2. Geography. 3. History. 4. Arms and Munitions. 5. Field and Permanent\r\nFortification. 6. Pioneer Service. 7. Rules of Drill and Exercise\r\n(in detail, for the arm in which the candidate has served, and generally\r\nfor the other arms.) 8. Manœuvring. 9. Military drawing, tested by the\r\nproduction of a drawing of the candidate’s own doing. 10. Military\r\nComposition, tested by working out an exercise in the presence of the\r\nCommission. 11. French. And finally, 12, the candidate must be able to\r\nspeak one of the national languages of the Austrian Empire, Slavonic,\r\nHungarian, or Italian, and must write a good current and legible hand.\r\n\r\nThe amount of knowledge required in these subjects will be regulated by\r\nthe range of the text-books prescribed for use in the Academy at\r\nNeustadt. Regard, however, will not so much be given to the minutiæ of\r\nknowledge possessed by the candidate, but rather to the evidence of his\r\nhaving a correct judgment and quick apprehension, and the power of\r\nexpressing himself both orally and in writing.\r\n\r\nUpon the results of the examination, formally drawn up by the\r\nauthorities of the school, recommendations for admission will be\r\nsubmitted to the sanction of His Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe number of attendants in the War School is fixed at thirty, and the\r\nlength of course is two years.\r\n\r\nThe attending pupils receive, in addition to their ordinary pay, a\r\nmonthly allowance of twenty florins, rations, and allowance for two\r\nhorses; when employed in taking surveys and reconnoitring, they have an\r\nextra allowance of thirty florins monthly.\r\n\r\nThe War School is commanded by a General or Superior Field Officer.\r\n\r\nFive Field Officers or Captains, taken as a rule from the Staff, give\r\nlectures on the prescribed scientific subjects. One Field Officer or\r\nCaptain of Cavalry takes the duty of riding-master; and one civil\r\nProfessor that of instruction in the French language and literature.\r\nNecessary officers, attendants, and servants take the duty of adjutants,\r\nof the internal management, of the service, and of attending to the\r\nthirty horses.\r\n\r\nThe first year’s subjects of instruction are--\r\n\r\n  1. Military Drawing and the study of Ground and Positions. 2. Higher\r\nTactics. 3. Staff and Superior Adjutant Duty. 4. French Language and\r\nLiterature. 5. Riding.\r\n\r\nThose of the second year,--\r\n\r\n  1. Military Drawing, Ground and Positions. 2. Military Geography.\r\n3. Principles of Strategy, illustrated by representations of some of the\r\nmost instructive campaigns. 4. French Language and Literature.\r\n5. Riding.\r\n\r\nThe course begins on the 1st of November, and lasts to the end of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nThe Attendants at the War School must be practiced in those arms in\r\nwhich they have not served. They are for this purpose distributed into\r\nthe various bodies of troops forming the garrison of Vienna, go through\r\nthe exercises and manœuvres of these troops--in the first year with one,\r\nand in the second with the other arm. At the termination of these\r\nperiods of practice, they will be called upon to undertake the command\r\nof a Battery, of a Squadron of Cavalry, and of a Division of Infantry.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, the attendant pupils of the first year will go out\r\nupon a course of practical surveying; those of the second year will be\r\nsimilarly employed in reconnoitring, choosing sites for encampment,\r\ndiscovering, judging of, and describing proper points for taking up\r\npositions, forming _têtes-de-pont_, entrenched camps, and the like, and\r\nin performing other duties falling within the service of the Staff.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of October, the pupils of the second year will undergo\r\nan examination, which will be conducted, both orally and by papers.\r\n\r\nUpon the results of this the Supreme War Department will determine upon\r\ntheir promotion to the rank of First Lieutenants (if they are not\r\nalready of that rank,) and this without any reference to their previous\r\nposition, their position henceforth being simply determined by their\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nThe same grounds determine the cases of those who are admitted to the\r\nStaff, or who return to their respective arms.\r\n\r\nThose who, after a satisfactory completion of the course, return to\r\nservice with the troops, will, after three years’ meritorious service,\r\nbe specially recommended for extraordinary promotion.\r\n\r\n_Control of the Institutions._\r\n\r\nThe Upper and Lower Houses of Education, the Infantry School Companies,\r\nthe Cavalry School Squadrons, and the Frontier School Companies, are\r\nunder the orders of the Commanders of the Army, the Army Corps, or the\r\nmilitary government in whose district they are situated. The Artillery\r\nand Engineer School Companies are under the orders of the General\r\nArtillery and Engineer Departments; the Pioneer and Flotilla School\r\nCompanies, under those of the Quartermaster-General’s Department; the\r\nMarine School Company, under those of the Admiralty. Which\r\nfunctionaries, however, receive from the Supreme War Department all\r\ndirections relating to organization and instruction.\r\n\r\nThe Cadet Schools, the Academies, the Military Teachers’ School, the\r\nUpper Artillery and Engineer Course, and the War School, are immediately\r\nunder the orders of the Supreme War Department.\r\n\r\nThe general organization of all the military schools and places of\r\ninstruction is once for all established by the regulations sanctioned by\r\nHis Majesty. These regulations contain all that concerns the physical,\r\nmoral, and intellectual training of the pupils, and all have the one\r\nobject of rearing them up as worthy members of the Austrian army, and\r\nfaithful supporters of the throne and of the honor of their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. REMARKS ON THE AUSTRIAN MILITARY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English Commissioners in their General “_Report on the Education and\r\nTraining of Officers for the Scientific Corps_” hold the following\r\nlanguage:--\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the Military Education of Austria entitles it to rank\r\namong the chief Institutions of the Empire. It has been remodeled since\r\nthe wars of 1848, 1849. It is now centralized, and wholly directed by\r\none of the four Co-ordinate Sections of the War Office, which is\r\nindependent of the others, and reports directly to the Emperor. This\r\nEducational or “Fourth” Section has the control of between 300,000_l._\r\nand 400,000_l._ yearly. It provides for the free or nearly free\r\neducation of more than 5,000 pupils. The extent and completeness of the\r\nsystem will be best understood by a reference to the clear and valuable\r\nofficial account of the schools.[56]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 56: See _Ante_, p 412-441.]\r\n\r\nThe military schools are divided by this document into (1) those which\r\neducate pupils for _Non-commissioned Officers_, (2) those which educate\r\nfor _Officers_, (3) and those _Senior Schools_ which complete the\r\neducation and extend the instruction of both classes. The method of\r\ntraining Non-commissioned Officers is a peculiar and remarkable part of\r\nthe system.\r\n\r\n1. No less than 5,730 pupils are in process of being educated for\r\nNon-commissioned Officers. They are received into a Military School at\r\nseven years old, and at that early age are devoted to the army, with a\r\nkind of solemnity, by their fathers, somewhat similar to the practice at\r\nWoolwich Academy :--“I hereby pledge myself to surrender up my son to\r\nthe Imperial Military Service, in case of his being admitted into a\r\nMilitary Educational Institution, and I will under no pretext require\r\nhis return.” This promise, as the official document states, may no doubt\r\nbe recalled if the youth finds that he has mistaken his vocation; but it\r\nmust exercise great influence (and such is its avowed object) in\r\nretaining him in it.\r\n\r\nAfter passing successively through two Junior Institutions,--the Lower\r\nHouses of Education, where he continues till eleven years old, and the\r\nUpper Houses, where he remains till fifteen,--the boy receives his\r\nfinishing course in one of what are termed the School Companies, the\r\nhighest class of schools for training boys to become Non-commissioned\r\nOfficers in all arms of the service. These are twenty in number, and\r\nscattered over the whole Empire, containing generally 120 pupils each,\r\nthough in one case only sixty; and with a course of either two or three\r\nyears, according to the nature of the service. The extent and the\r\nrequirements of the Empire give a striking variety to their character.\r\nThus, in the frontier School Companies, “the range of the studies is\r\nmore extensive, because the Non-commissioned Officers on the Military\r\nFrontiers are intrusted with the general administration, and require of\r\nnecessity a knowledge of Political Administration, of Jurisprudence, and\r\nAgriculture;” and thus also the Non-commissioned Officers for the\r\nresponsible Flotilla Service of the mouths of the great rivers, the\r\nlagoons of the Po, the head of the Adriatic, and the lakes, are\r\ncarefully educated and frequently promoted. Following the course of a\r\npupil through these Upper Houses and School Companies, we were much\r\nstruck by the sensible and vigorous character of the education, and the\r\nmotives supplied for exertion. In the Upper Houses the boys compete for\r\nentrance to the School Companies which they prefer, and the more\r\nscientific companies are a special object of ambition, because it is\r\nmore usual in these for young men to be raised by their talents to the\r\nAcademies, and thus made Officers, “free of all cost:” according to the\r\nregulations, however, this is possible in all. It may be stated that\r\nfrom six to ten pupils from each of the more scientific School\r\nCompanies,--the Artillery, Engineer, Pioneer, Flotilla, and Marine\r\nCompanies,--are yearly transferred to the Academies, to complete their\r\neducation there for the Officer’s Commission.\r\n\r\nA system of this kind, supplying at once a good education and large\r\nopportunities of advancement, must necessarily operate as a great\r\nencouragement to young men educating for Non-commissioned Officers; and\r\nallowing for the social differences of the two countries, it resembles\r\nin spirit the French system, which throws open the gates of the\r\nPolytechnic and St. Cyr, and with them a proportion of the Commissions\r\nin the Army, to all.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not all. The sums devoted to the education of\r\nNon-commissioned Officers, as well as Officers, are immense, and may be\r\nregarded as a spontaneous contribution of the National Feeling, no less\r\nthan a State provision. A system both of public and private foundations\r\n(_Stiftungen_) prevails--part derived from the Emperor, part from the\r\nprovinces, part from private gifts and legacies--by which 3,190 pupils\r\nare supported in the Houses of Education and the School Companies, and\r\n1,320 in the Cadet Schools and Academies. The very large majority of\r\nthese exhibitions supply a _complete_, about 200 a _partial_,\r\nmaintenance. And it is curious to observe the aid to education which is\r\nso common in our own Universities, devoted in Austria to what may be\r\ntermed the great National Institution--the Army,--and retaining all the\r\nlimitations to the descendants of Founders or Natives of provinces which\r\nmarked our own foundations. Some of these exhibitions have been founded\r\nby foreign soldiers for their own countrymen. Thus there are two bearing\r\nthe name of the O’Gara and the O’Brady, to be held by any Irishmen of\r\ngood family, one of which is in the gift of the Roman Catholic\r\nArchbishop of Dublin. We should add that this system is still a living\r\nand popular one. Within three years the city of Brünn has founded such\r\nan exhibition “for sons of Austrian subjects in Moravia, and by\r\npreference in Brünn, in commemoration of His Majesty’s escape from\r\nassassination in 1853.” We ourselves heard a distinguished Officer\r\nexpress an intention of founding one of these Exhibitions. The\r\ncomparison with the open _Bourses_ of the Polytechnic is remarkable; but\r\nthe Austrian appointments to free places seem to be given, like the\r\nPrussian, solely as rewards for the service of the parent.\r\n\r\n2. The education of young men for Officers is conducted upon the same\r\nprinciples which regulate that for Non-commissioned Officers. The age of\r\nadmission to a Cadet School is about eleven. The pupils are pledged to\r\nthe service with the same formalities which we have noticed in the Lower\r\nHouses of Education. Between fifteen and sixteen they enter one of the\r\nAcademies for the Line, the Artillery, the Engineers, or the Marine, and\r\nafter four years they pass to their respective services.\r\n\r\nThus, unlike the French system, that which is followed in Austria\r\ncommits the pupil to the Army, and to a Military Education, from an\r\nearly age, resembling herein the plan of the _Accademia Militare_ of\r\nTurin. But an attempt seems to be made to combine general with special\r\nteaching. Thus, although even in the two first years (from fifteen to\r\nseventeen,) at Wiener Neustadt, there is some introduction of successful\r\npractical military teaching, the chief weight is thrown upon\r\nmathematics, history, geography, drawing, and French; special military\r\nteaching has a greater, though far from an exclusive place, in the two\r\nlast years. The studies are high, and (as far as we could judge) pursued\r\ncarefully, and with excellent discipline.\r\n\r\nThe description we have given of the system pursued in the Schools for\r\nNon-commissioned Officers will have shown that there is a constant\r\nappeal to emulation. The same is found at Wiener Neustadt. There is a\r\ncareful system of assigning credits during the whole school period,\r\nwhich itself argues competition. The chief immediate reward, indeed, is\r\nthe choice of a regiment on leaving the school; but the prospect of\r\nentering the Staff School stands in no distant perspective, and this is\r\nfilled with so many pupils from Wiener Neustadt, that it must be looked\r\nupon as the sure reward of a successful Neustadter. There are other\r\ninducements of a different character. The discipline being strict,\r\npupils are constantly removed from Wiener Neustadt and the other\r\nAcademies to the schools for Non-commissioned Officers, and though\r\nsometimes allowed to enter the army as Officers, it must always be as\r\njuniors to their contemporaries at Wiener Neustadt. We heard instances\r\nof great strictness in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe new course for the Special Arms in Austria is not yet completely in\r\noperation. It is at present carried on separately in the Academy of\r\nOlmütz for the Artillery, and that of Znaim, in Moravia, for the\r\nEngineers. There are 200 pupils in each Academy, and the courses of\r\ninstruction, which are more special or technical than at Wiener\r\nNeustadt, last four years, from the age of fifteen to nineteen. The\r\nyearly examinations, the manner in which the marks of the monthly\r\nexaminations tell on the final one, and the careful classification of\r\nthe pupils in the order of merit, reminded us of the system of the\r\nPolytechnic more than any other school we have seen. And an inspection\r\nof the very high credits obtained by the first thirty pupils will prove\r\nthe diligence with which the studies are pursued. We should add that\r\nseveral pupils of marked talents come from the scientific School\r\nCompanies, A further fact bears witness to the vigor of the discipline.\r\nWe have alluded to the dismissal of unpromising subjects from the\r\nAustrian Military Schools. In the course of three years, since the\r\nchanges of 1850, it appears that nearly 100 pupils were removed from\r\nZnaim, as not coming up to the standard required for the Engineers by\r\nthe new regulations.\r\n\r\n3. The courses of instruction in the three Academies for Infantry and\r\nCavalry, Artillery, and for Engineers, last for the same time, and run\r\n(as it were) parallel to each other. Each is, or is to be, completed by\r\na senior department. The United Course for the Artillery and Engineers\r\nis not indeed yet combined in the magnificent buildings begun at Wiener\r\nNeustadt; but it is already organized in a provisional state at Znaim\r\nfor the Engineers, and the plan of instruction drawn up is a solid one.\r\nThe arrangements for the general Staff School require more remark.\r\n\r\nIn our report upon Austrian schools we have specially noticed this\r\nSchool as remarkable for its thorough and open competitive character\r\nfrom first to last, and its very sensible plan of study. Admission to it\r\nis by competition, open to Officers of all arms: the pupils are not\r\nunduly overburdened with work; perhaps, there is even room for one or\r\ntwo more subjects of importance; but what is done seems to be done\r\nthoroughly; the Officers are carefully ranked, on leaving the School,\r\naccording as the abilities they have displayed, may be considered a\r\ncriterion of their fitness for employment on the General Staff; and _in\r\nthis order_ they enter the Staff Corps. The consequence is that every\r\nOfficer knows distinctly, from the time that he first competes for\r\nadmission until his final examination on leaving, that the order in\r\nwhich he will enter the Staff depends entirely on his own exertions and\r\nsuccess at the school. It seemed to us that this open competition\r\nproduced a spirit of confidence and energy in the students, as great, if\r\nnot greater, than any we met with elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the above system of education is directed by the Fourth\r\nSection of the War Department. In all the schools we found traces of its\r\nactivity; and the energy and system which prevail in the Military\r\nTeaching of Austria appear in great measure to result from its being\r\ndirected by this single head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE STAFF OR WAR SCHOOL AT VIENNA.\r\n\r\n[From Report of English Commissioners in 1856.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Staff School (Kriegs-Schule,) in Vienna, was established in 1851,\r\nand grew out of the experience of the Hungarian war, although a\r\nStaff-Corps had existed for more than a century in the Austrian army,\r\nand for many years past all the appointments in it have been made upon\r\nan examination, which was, in fact, one of competition. The process was\r\nformerly as follows:--\r\n\r\nAn officer desirous of becoming a candidate for a staff appointment,\r\nsent in his name to the colonel of his regiment, whose recommendation he\r\nwas obliged to obtain as a preliminary step. If supplied with this, he\r\nbegan his course of staff study, and was sent for this purpose to some\r\nlarge garrison town as an _attaché_ to the staff. Whilst here he went\r\nthrough, for two years, the course of drawing, writing military memoirs,\r\nmapping the country, &c., and for two years more served on active staff\r\nduty with different bodies of troops. At the end of these four years a\r\nnumber of the officers thus employed in a particular country were\r\nbrought together, and examined by the chief of the staff in the country,\r\nassisted by a board of officers appointed for the purpose. No actual\r\nlist was drawn out of the order in which the candidates acquitted\r\nthemselves, but it was understood that the best were chosen and put upon\r\nthe general staff. The work upon this was exceedingly laborious; few\r\nexcept officers of real ability were candidates for it, and patronage in\r\nit was looked upon with great dislike. On the other hand, studies and\r\nreading were not made the first requisite; a ready intelligence and\r\nquick eye to make an officer a _Colonnen-führer_,--leader of a column on\r\na march,--were always most valued.\r\n\r\nBefore describing this school, it may be as well to mention shortly the\r\nstaff-corps and the corps connected with it.\r\n\r\n1. The General Staff of the Austrian Army consists of:--\r\n\r\n  Twelve Colonels.\r\n  Twelve Lieutenant-Colonels.\r\n  Twenty-four Majors.\r\n  Eighty Captains.\r\n\r\nThe _attachés_, to the number of eighty,--_i.e._, those who are\r\nexpecting appointments, may be subalterns, but they obtain the rank of\r\ncaptain on joining.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the staff-corps is Field-Marshal Hess.\r\n\r\n2. There has been created very lately a separate corps of adjutants or\r\naids-de-camp, who are charged with the administrative duties, such as\r\ninspecting the bearing, equipment, carrying on the discipline, &c., of\r\nthe troops. This consists of--\r\n\r\n  Eleven Generals.\r\n  Eighteen Lieutenant-Colonels.\r\n  Eighteen Majors.\r\n  Fifty-eight First Captains.\r\n  Ten Second Captains.\r\n  Ten First Lieutenants.\r\n\r\nThere is no examination for entrance into this corps. Appointments are\r\nmade by the generals, and we were told that there was some scope for\r\n“protection.”\r\n\r\n3. There is also a smaller corps for the purpose of surveying, called\r\nthe Corps of Geographical Engineers, connected with the staff, inasmuch\r\nas some of the staff officers draw the maps on a large scale, which it\r\nis the business of this corps to reduce. It is usually occupied on the\r\nGreat Surveys of the Empire; at present it is employed on the Survey of\r\nthe Principalities.\r\n\r\nIt consists of--\r\n\r\n  One Colonel, called the Director.\r\n  Two Lieutenant-Colonels.\r\n  Two Majors.\r\n  Sixteen Captains.\r\n  Sixteen Lieutenants.\r\n  Four Sous-Lieutenants.\r\n\r\nThe staff school consists of thirty pupils taken from all arms of the\r\nservice, fifteen being received each year, and the course of study\r\nlasting two years. It is under the direction of a general and a\r\nlieutenant-colonel; and, with few exceptions, such as might occur in the\r\ntime of war, no appointments on the general staff are to be given to any\r\nofficers who have not passed through the staff school.\r\n\r\nIn order to enter the school for the staff corps, an officer must have\r\nserved at least two years with his regiment, and be unmarried, and above\r\ntwenty-one and under twenty-six years of age. He may then forward to the\r\nchief of the staff, through his colonel, his claim to be admitted as a\r\ncandidate at the entrance examination. Further inquiry is made, and a\r\ngood many of the names sent in are struck off the list. Such, we were\r\ntold, was the case last year when the names sent in were very numerous,\r\nbut out of these only forty-five were allowed to compete, and out of\r\nthese again only fifteen (the regular yearly number) were selected. The\r\ncompetition for entrance into the school is indeed said to have been\r\nvery active ever since it was opened. Most of the students are\r\n_Neustadters_; the seven professors were all, with the exception of the\r\nprofessor of the French language, military men, and chiefly officers of\r\nartillery, formed in the long studies of the old Bombardier School.\r\n\r\nThe subjects in which the candidates for admission are examined are--\r\n\r\n   1. Algebra and Geometry, Plane and Spherical Trigonometry.\r\n   2. Geography.\r\n   3. History.\r\n   4. Arms and Munitions.\r\n   5. Field and Permanent Fortification.\r\n   6. Pioneering.\r\n   7. Rules of Drill and Exercises.\r\n   8. Manoeuvring.\r\n   9. Military Drawing.\r\n  10. Military Composition.\r\n  11. French.\r\n  12. To be able to speak one of the Austrian national languages,\r\n      and to write a good current and legible hand.\r\n\r\nThe most striking features in the system of this school, both at the\r\nentrance and throughout the course, are that it is distinctly\r\ncompetitive, that it admits very young officers, and that while the work\r\nis considerable, the subjects for study are not numerous. In these three\r\npoints it differs considerably from the Prussian Staff School, in which\r\nthe students are generally older, and the principle of competition is\r\nnot so fully carried out. In the Austrian school, the students are\r\nplaced on entering in the order which their entrance examination has\r\njust fixed. They are examined once a month during their stay. On leaving\r\nthe school, their respective places are again determined, and they have\r\na claim for appointments in the staff corps in the exact order in which\r\nthey were placed on leaving the school.\r\n\r\nTheir relative places on leaving the school are assigned to them, as we\r\nwere assured, very carefully, and, after much consultation in every case\r\namong the professors; but this is not done by marks, nor by any minute\r\nsystem of testing intellectual qualifications, but an estimate is formed\r\nupon the whole work of the two years, both on the studies in the school\r\nand the practice in the field,--of the student’s comparative fitness,\r\n_as an officer, for the work of the staff_. “We try to estimate the\r\nwhole man,” was the expression used to us, “whether he will make a good\r\n_Colonnen-führer_” (a good man to direct a regiment on a march,) as was\r\nsaid elsewhere. This general estimate was preferred to that of marks, on\r\nthe ground that the latter might give too much weight to the more\r\nappreciable, _i.e._, simply intellectual qualities.\r\n\r\nThe students do not at present live within the establishment, but are to\r\ndo so when the new ones, building, are ready. They begin their lectures\r\nat half-past seven and end at one or three o’clock on alternate days,\r\ngoing to the riding-school in the afternoon on the days when their\r\nmorning’s work ends at one. Thirty horses are kept for their use.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of instruction during the first year consist of--\r\n\r\n  1. Military Drawing and the Study of Ground and Positions.\r\n  2. Higher Tactics.\r\n  3. Staff Duties.\r\n  4. French Language and Literature.\r\n  5. Riding.\r\n\r\nAnd those of the second year are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  1. Military Drawing, and the Study of Ground and Positions.\r\n  2. Military Geography.\r\n  3. Principles of Strategy, illustrated by representations of\r\n     some of the most instructive campaigns.\r\n  4. French Language and Literature.\r\n  5. Riding.\r\n\r\nThe students are occupied at the school about eight hours daily and\r\ntheir chief work is military drawing and topography. We went into the\r\nroom where the students of both years were working together at drawings\r\nand plans under an artillery officer, said to be one of the best\r\ndraughtsmen in the army. Some of the plans were modeled in soap, the\r\n_hachures_ being marked very elaborately, so that the models and\r\ndrawings might closely correspond. We also attended a lecture of the\r\nsecond class in military geography. A student traced out on the\r\nblackboard the line of the Western Alps, and was examined very closely\r\non the smaller passes, the rivers, and the bases of operations for\r\narmies on both sides. The answers were very minute, and given with the\r\ngreatest readiness; and we understood the question to be taken at\r\nrandom, and not to be a prepared one.[57]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 57: It may be desirable to give some specimens, taken\r\n    from the official account of the school, of the questions put at\r\n    the examinations for admission,\r\n\r\n    I. _Viva voce._\r\n\r\n      1.

How\r\n          are the trigonometrical functions of the different quadrants\r\n          of the circle indicated?\r\n      2. Geography:--\r\n       What is meant by the _backbone_ of Europe? What states does\r\n          it pass through?\r\n        The source of the Elbe; its principal feeders?\r\n      3. History:--\r\n        Describe generally the wars of Charles V.\r\n        The political consequences of the Battle of Leipzig.\r\n      4.

Field and Permanent Fortification:--\r\n        How is a trench made?\r\n        How is a parapet built?\r\n        What does a front of fortification consist of? what is the\r\n          disposition of the several lines? what parts protect the\r\n          principal rampart? what is the form of the flanks? and how\r\n          is the main ditch made?\r\n        What is meant by detached works? where are they placed?\r\n        What are the best arrangements for the successful defense of\r\n          a fortress?\r\n      6. Pioneer Service:--\r\n        How are two beams of the same dimensions fastened together\r\n          in the same direction?\r\n        How are suspension bridges put up?\r\n      7. Rules for Drill and Exercise:--\r\n        (_a._) Infantry.\r\n          Wheeling during a march.\r\n          Forming of close battalion column.\r\n        (_b._) Cavalry.\r\n          Marching in files and fours.\r\n          Forming line from the flank to the front and rear.\r\n        (_c._) Artillery.\r\n          Intervals and distances in a battery.\r\n\r\n    II.

Prove that in every triangle the square of the one side\r\n          is equal to the sum of the squares of the two other sides,\r\n          less twice the product of these two, multiplied by the\r\n          cosine of the angle they inclose.\r\n        2. If the hypothenuse is 33, and one angle 25° 48’ 12”, find\r\n          the other angle and the perpendicular, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe student officers attending the school are called upon to serve in\r\nthose arms to which they do not belong. For this purpose they join the\r\ntroops of the garrison of Vienna during June, July, August, and\r\nSeptember, and if they belong to the infantry they go through all the\r\nexercises of the cavalry in one year, and of the artillery in another.\r\nIf they belong to the cavalry, they go in the same manner through the\r\nexercises of infantry and artillery. After going through this practice,\r\nthey have to take command of a battery, of a squadron of cavalry, and of\r\na division of infantry.\r\n\r\nThe month of May is devoted in the first year to an expedition for\r\npractice in surveying the country, and in the second, for making\r\nreconnaissances, &c.\r\n\r\nOctober is a vacation in the first year. In the second it is taken up\r\nwith the final examination before leaving.\r\n\r\nThe officers acting as professors receive 600 florins, about 60_l._\r\nannually, besides their pay.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the final examination, if there are any vacancies in\r\nthe staff corps, the pupils receive appointments in order of merit, and\r\nare at the same time made captains. In proof of their receiving\r\nappointments on the earliest opportunity, we were told by Colonel\r\nScudier that the last ten vacancies in the staff corps were filled up\r\nout of the twelve students who had just left the school. One of these\r\nwas only a second lieutenant, and in order to make him a captain, (the\r\nrank required for the staff corps,) the Emperor promoted him to be a\r\nfirst lieutenant immediately, and to be a captain within three days\r\nafterwards. This double promotion was on the ground of great merit.\r\n\r\nIf an officer finds no vacancy in the staff corps ready for him, he must\r\nreturn to his regiment and wait as an attaché. But if a second\r\nlieutenant, he is entitled immediately to a step of rank, and if a\r\nlieutenant, after three years’ service he is made a captain, although he\r\nmay not even then be attached to the staff corps.\r\n\r\nThere are to be eighty of these attachés to the staff. Their number at\r\npresent amounts to only thirteen.\r\n\r\nWith regard to special aids-de-camp, generals are allowed to choose\r\ntheir own, without examination, but with this limitation, the officer\r\nchosen must not be a relation.[58]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 58: The following shows the nature of the Report\r\n    presented by the examiners upon an Officer examined for admission.\r\n    It is called the _Prüfungs-Act_, and is sent into the Supreme War\r\n    Department, that is, to the Fourth Section.\r\n\r\n    Form No. I. gives the name, age, rank, and length of service of\r\n    the Candidate (Lieut.

It was not difficult to account\r\nfor ultimate defeat in the larger armies and better prepared in all the\r\nresources by which large armies are equipped, fed, and moved. But\r\nmilitary critics were not slow in discovering that better preparation\r\nshould have been made, the field should have been taken earlier, and the\r\nforces combined and moved with great certainty and skill.\r\n\r\n  In a Report by the Minister of War on the necessity of reorganizing\r\nthe educational system of the Imperial army, and in the plan for such\r\nreorganization the author, Baron Kahn, starts with a principle which the\r\ngreat Empress Maria Theresa announced when she laid in 1748 the\r\nfoundation of the earliest war school in Austria (Wiener Neustadt), and\r\nwhich Frederick the Great avowedly imitated in his War Academy in Berlin\r\nin 1764,--“In this school shall be formed _men_ only, and of them,\r\n_soldiers_.” The choice of the profession of arms must be postponed till\r\na good general education, reaching the moral as well as the intellectual\r\nand physical qualities of the future officer, has been imparted. The\r\nseparation of the military pupils from their families at an early age\r\nmust be avoided, and hence the number of cadet boarding schools for\r\nyoung aspirants are diminished. The intellectual preparation required,\r\nthe sharpening and hardening the mental faculties, must not be gained by\r\nan exclusive mathematical course, in special schools, but in the general\r\ntraining of the public schools, the Real Schools or Gymnasia, of the\r\ncountry. A more practical knowledge of the common studies,--of geography\r\nand national history and the whole science of public economy and the\r\nmartial resources of the empire, must be gained before the special\r\nmilitary instruction begins. Admission to the higher military schools\r\nmust be given only to aspirants of mature age, of high moral qualities,\r\nand of thorough intellectual activity--ascertained by careful\r\nexamination and tested by at least one year’s service in connection with\r\na regiment.\r\n\r\n  PLAN OF REORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\n  The military schools are divided into two classes, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  (1.) Those which give a boy a general education, but prepare him at\r\nthe same time for the military profession.\r\n\r\n  (2.) Those which educate boys only in military matters.\r\n\r\n  In the first class may be included (_a_) all those lower class\r\ninstitutions in which military orphans and sons of poor non-commissioned\r\nofficers and commissioned officers are educated; (_b_) the middle\r\n(cadet) schools which prepare students for the military academies; (_c_)\r\nthe military academies, viz, _Wiener Neustadt_, and the engineer and\r\nartillery academies. As pure military schools, may be mentioned the\r\nschools for non-commissioned officers in the infantry, engineer,\r\nartillery, and pioneer corps; the cadet and division schools in the\r\ninfantry; the higher artillery and engineer courses.\r\n\r\n  (_a._) The lower schools for the education of military orphans of a\r\ntender age have the same system as the common schools of the like class\r\n(_Normal_ or _Volks Schulen_), where the moral qualities are to be\r\nchiefly inculcated on Christian principles; it is therefore necessary\r\nthat children should not be taken from family influences earlier than\r\ncan be helped. It will therefore only be necessary to take into these\r\nschools such children as are orphans, or sons of penniless parents, or\r\nat all events those whose families can not be induced to educate them at\r\nhome even by pecuniary assistance. One school would be enough for such\r\nboys, in which the moral education would be the first object, as the\r\nnecessary education required to prepare the scholars for the higher\r\nschools and regimental cadet schools may be obtained by their attending\r\nthe public schools.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) As regards the middle cadet schools, they should be abolished,\r\nas they do not agree at all with the above-mentioned principles. Boys\r\nare torn from home at much too tender an age, and are not brought up in\r\nthe path of morality. Should a reform only of these schools be intended,\r\nthis would be so expensive that the improvement gained would be dearly\r\npaid for.\r\n\r\n  As the army is not only to be composed of drilled soldiers, but also\r\nof generally well educated men, in order to improve their intellectual\r\nposition and the spirit of the army, and to prevent the undue growth of\r\ndrill and mere formalities, it is of great necessity that the military\r\nschools should be brought into harmonious concert with the civil\r\nschools. The deficiencies of the latter are less than those of the\r\nformer, and it may be expected that they will soon be removed. In\r\naccordance with these considerations (and there are yet many more), it\r\nis much to be recommended that these two institutions should be\r\nabolished, not only as being right in principle, but also in agreement\r\nwith the laws of national economy.\r\n\r\n  By the laying down of the system of education to be taught at the\r\ncommon middle schools, as a condition of being allowed to enter a\r\nmilitary academy, in connection with the influences of the moral\r\ndevelopment of the family circle, up to the fifteenth year of a boy’s\r\nlife, it is to be hoped that the general above-named principles will be\r\nattained; and when the poor officers are allowed the means to educate\r\ntheir boys aspiring for the military academies by granting them\r\npecuniary allowances, it may be hoped that they will not only be\r\ncontented, and will care for the moral education of their children, but\r\nthat the State also will find in the system the best means of attaining\r\nits object.\r\n\r\n  As regards the higher schools, especially military ones, the following\r\nmay be observed:--\r\n\r\n  There are two establishments at present:\r\n\r\n  (_a._) The Military Academy and Wiener Neustadt for general education.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) The Engineer Academy, as a special school for the engineers,\r\nand for the instruction of officers in general.\r\n\r\n  The latter of the two is not efficient enough, for not more than eight\r\nor ten persons at most are instructed as engineers in it, the rest being\r\ndetailed for the infantry, cavalry, &c. As by the establishment and\r\norganization of division schools a sufficient supply of officers\r\naspirant is provided, and as the officers detailed from the above-named\r\nacademies to the line are not more efficient than the scholars of the\r\ndivision schools (especially when the extra cost of the academy\r\neducation is considered), the Engineer Academy must be looked upon as\r\nmuch too expensive. I agree, therefore, with those who recommend its\r\nabolition. On the other hand, the Neustadt Academy, which offers to its\r\nstudents a more general, and therefore a better founded education, and\r\nwhere highly instructed officers can be educated in larger numbers, may\r\nbe allowed to remain, both in consideration of its efficiency and in\r\nhonor of its serene foundress, the great Empress Maria Theresa, but on\r\ncondition of its being reorganized in accordance with the principles\r\nlaid down by that noble lady in the following words:--“That in this\r\nschool shall be formed _men_ only, and of them _soldiers_.”\r\n\r\n  The said academy must, however, seek to attain to a higher degree of\r\nperfection than of late. The classics must be more cultivated, as also\r\nnational economy and a general civilized education. It should be\r\norganized for a course of six years, and it should receive students,\r\nsons of officers or military officials, who have successfully passed two\r\nor three Latin or technical schools.\r\n\r\n  The following subjects should be taught, besides the military and\r\nmathematical sciences:--\r\n\r\n    (1.) The Latin language, sufficient to understand the Roman\r\nclassics.\r\n\r\n    (2.) All human sciences; particular attention should be paid to\r\nstyle, as it has been observed that since Latin has not been taught in\r\nthe Wiener Neustadt Academy, there has been a great falling off in this\r\nrespect. Rhetoric is to be taught in a practical manner, as the\r\nknowledge of how to speak is of importance in our constitutional era.\r\n\r\n    (3.) Philosophy, two years; in the first year, psychology; in the\r\nsecond year, logic to its full extent, moral philosophy, metaphysics,\r\nand the history of philosophy.\r\n\r\n    (4.) Statecraft, state and international law, and the fundamental\r\nlaw of the Austrian monarchy.\r\n\r\n    (5.) The rudiments of economy and national economy.\r\n\r\n  As special schools for the army the following should be retained:--\r\n\r\n    (_a._) A special engineer and artillery school.\r\n\r\n    (_b._) A special school for the pioneer corps, where the special\r\nknowledge necessary for that arm, as well as other military matters, are\r\ntaught. The scholars should be between the ages of 16 and 19 years.\r\n\r\n  The students of the institutions intended for the education of the\r\nengineers and artillery will be enrolled in their respective corps\r\nquartered in Vienna. They will there have to pass a proper course of\r\nhigh mathematics, natural philosophy, and architecture at the\r\nPolytechnic; after they have succeeded in this, they will be either\r\ndetailed for two years’ active duty with their corps, or they may be at\r\nonce ordered to pass through a higher combined course for artillery and\r\nengineers. If this will suffice for the due supply of technically\r\ninstructed officers, the artillery and engineer academies may be\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\n  As regards the present school for the General Staff, it may be\r\nrecommended that a general college for the whole army should be formed\r\nfrom it, wherein not only the higher military sciences should be taught,\r\nbut also statecraft and national economy. It would be right to examine a\r\ncandidate before he entered the college in the rudiments of natural\r\nphilosophy and chemistry.\r\n\r\n  The student may obtain the time necessary for the cultivation of these\r\ntwo sciences by reducing the time till now assigned to sketching and\r\nsurveying; the more so, as the student will have already attained a\r\ngreat perfection in this branch of his education by former study of it\r\nin the public and preparatory schools.\r\n\r\n  SYSTEM AS REORGANIZED IN 1869.\r\n\r\n  (A.)--ESTABLISHMENTS FOR THE EDUCATION OF YOUTH.\r\n\r\n  1. _Military Orphan Asylum._\r\n\r\n  Military orphans and other deserving candidates for the army are\r\nsupported in this establishment. They are educated at the public\r\nschools.\r\n\r\n  The number of pupils is 150. They pass thence into the other\r\ninstitutions, according to their talents and final destination.\r\n\r\n  2. _Military Technical Schools._\r\n\r\n  At present four in number. It is proposed to reduce them to two. The\r\ncourse is of three years. Number of pupils, 150 in each school. They are\r\neducated for the Technical Academy, and to provide good non-commissioned\r\nofficers for the Artillery and Engineers. They enter at 14 and leave at\r\n16 years of age, at the end of their third year’s course of study. Those\r\nenter the Technical Academy who have most distinguished themselves; the\r\nothers are sent either for a two years’ course to the Division Schools,\r\nor else to the Artillery Officers’ Aspirant Schools.\r\n\r\n  3. _The Military College._\r\n\r\n  The course is for two years. This is chiefly intended as a preparatory\r\nschool for the Military Academy at Wiener Neustadt.\r\n\r\n  4. _The Military Academies._\r\n\r\n  These institutions are intended to provide the army with officers\r\nproperly qualified for the various branches of the army.\r\n\r\n  (1.) _The Wiener Neustadt Academy._--The course is of four years.\r\nNumber of scholars 100 per annum, or a total of 400. The academy is\r\nintended for the education of candidates for the Infantry Regiments of\r\nthe Line and Military Frontier, the Jagers, and the Cavalry.\r\n\r\n  (2.) _The Technical Academy_ (established in Vienna) for the education\r\nof the best pupils of the technical schools for the artillery, engineer,\r\nand pioneer services. The course is of four years; 65 scholars in each\r\nyear, or 260 total. Each year’s course of study is divided into two\r\nsections, one for artillery pupils, one for engineer pupils.\r\n\r\n  It is proposed that these officers should be attached to their\r\nrespective corps in Vienna during their course of study, and should\r\nattend lectures at the Polytechnic at Vienna. When this course is over,\r\nthey are to be attached for two years’ service with their corps, or sent\r\ndirect to go through the higher artillery or engineer course.\r\n\r\n  (B.)--SCHOOLS ATTACHED TO REGIMENTS OR DIVISIONS.\r\n\r\n  1. _Regimental, Troop, and Cadet Schools._\r\n\r\n  Besides the troop schools in each regiment or independent battalion,\r\nthere is one of the cadet schools for the education of all those, from\r\nthe rank of sergeant downwards, who aspire to the rank of cadet, or who\r\ndesire to acquire the preparatory knowledge necessary to be admitted\r\ninto the schools for officers aspirant.\r\n\r\n  The number of pupils depends on the number of individuals qualified.\r\nThe course is of two years.\r\n\r\n  2. _Regimental Schools for Officers aspirant._\r\n\r\n  (_a._) For the _Artillery_--The course is of two years; 50 scholars\r\nannually.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) For the _Engineers_--A two years’ course for each.\r\n_Pioneers_--Number of pupils according to demand.\r\n\r\n  3. _Divisional Schools for Officers aspirant._\r\n\r\n  There is a school of this sort in each of the 23 infantry and cavalry\r\ndivisions, and for the country gendarmerie.\r\n\r\n  The course is of two years. Number of pupils not fixed (at present\r\nnearly 1,200), in addition to which is the special instruction for their\r\nrespective arms; when they have successfully passed an examination at\r\nthe end of the course, they become officers aspirant.\r\n\r\n  (C.)--ESTABLISHMENTS FOR MORE ADVANCED PROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n  1. _The Higher Courses for the Artillery, and_ (2) _Engineers_.\r\n\r\n  These are intended for the formation of highly scientific officers for\r\nthe more important duties and higher command of these arms, and for the\r\narmy in general. The course is of two years. The number of officer\r\nstudents is not fixed, but must depend on the number of highly qualified\r\ncandidates of the above arms. They must have served for two years with\r\ntheir corps with distinction.\r\n\r\n  3. _War School_ (Staff College).\r\n\r\n  This institution is intended for the formation of officers for the\r\ngeneral staff. The course is of two years. The number of students is 80.\r\n\r\n  An officer must have served at least three years with his corps with\r\ndistinction before he can be admitted, and officers who have served\r\nlonger will, as a rule, be preferred.\r\n\r\n  (4.) _Course for Military Frontier Instruction._\r\n\r\n  This is an academy for those who are already serving in the army. The\r\ncourse is of two years, and the number of pupils is regulated by the\r\ndemand. The studies are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    State organization and frontier administration.\r\n    Civil and military law and legal procedure.\r\n    Agriculture, law of commerce, and exchange.\r\n    Revenue law and institutions.\r\n    Croatian language.\r\n\r\n  5. _Central Cavalry School at Vienna._\r\n\r\n  The object of this establishment is to prepare distinguished\r\nregimental officers for the higher commands in cavalry, and to instruct\r\nthem in the theory and practice of that arm, and the _haute école_ of\r\nriding.\r\n\r\n  There are 41 students of the rank of captain (1st and 2d class), or\r\none from each cavalry regiment. The course is of one year. The studies\r\nare as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Theoretical and practical riding, training of unbroken horses,\r\nservice and drill regulations of cavalry, veterinary art, leaping,\r\nfencing, pistol-shooting, rudiments of strategy and history of war,\r\ntactics, field service, occupation of ground, surveying, army\r\norganization, knowledge of arms, pioneer and engineer service, practical\r\ndrill, and field service and reconnaissances.\r\n\r\n  6. _Josephinum Academy for Medicine and Surgery_,\r\n\r\n  For the formation of students for the higher grades of the medical and\r\nsurgical departments, from the rank of first lieutenant-surgeon.\r\n\r\n  This establishment ranks with the upper school of surgery at Vienna.\r\nThe number of students from the army is fixed at 242. When there is\r\naccommodation there are, besides this, paying students.\r\n\r\n  7. _Military Veterinary Institution_,\r\n\r\n  Consisting of two sections:--(1.) Veterinary. (2.) Farriery.\r\n\r\n  Students who have passed the necessary examinations are entitled to\r\ntheir diploma and rights in the same way as students of the civil\r\nveterinary school in Hungary.\r\n\r\n  The students of the veterinary section are field surgeons and\r\nfarriers.\r\n\r\n  The students of the farriery section are non-commissioned officers and\r\nsoldiers and civilians. The number of soldier students depends upon the\r\nrequirements of the army.\r\n\r\n  8. _Course for the Intendance._\r\n\r\n  This establishment, _when organized_, is intended to qualify captains\r\nor first-lieutenants on the active establishment of infantry or cavalry,\r\ncaptain auditors, and properly qualified clerks, for the administration\r\nof the Intendance of the army now in progress of formation.\r\n\r\n  COURSES OF STUDY IN THE MILITARY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n  (I.) COURSE OF SCIENCES TO BE TAUGHT AND LECTURED ON AT THE\r\n  REGIMENTAL CADET SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n    _Subjects._         _Course of Lectures during--1st Year._\r\n                                                         _2d Year._\r\n\r\n    German Language and Style,                        1    1\r\n    The Regimental Dialect,                           1    1\r\n    Caligraphy,                                       1    1\r\n    Military Style,                                   1    1\r\n    Arithmetic,                                       1    0\r\n    Algebra,                                          0    1\r\n    Practical Surveying,                              1    1\r\n    Mapping and Tracing,                              1    1\r\n    Geography,                                        1    1\r\n    History,                                          1    1\r\n    Drill and Manœuvre Regulations,                   1    1\r\n    Service Regulations,                              1    1\r\n    Field Service,                                    1    1\r\n    Pioneer Service,                                  1    1\r\n    Construction of Arms,                             1    1\r\n    Hand Drawing,                                     1    1\r\n    Fencing,                                          1    1\r\n    Gymnastics, &c.,                                  1    1\r\n    Target Practice,                                  1    1\r\n\r\n  (II.)

All\r\nthe officers are borne on the army rosters according to their ranks, in\r\nparticular branches of the service. No one will be allowed to enter the\r\nStaff School until he has served three or four years with the troops,\r\nand then captains and first lieutenants will be preferred to men of less\r\nservice or rank. Having passed through the school course they will again\r\njoin their regiments; and will then be appointed to the staff, as may be\r\nrequired. The period during which they are to remain on the staff will\r\ndepend on their merits, their promotion, and the exigencies of the\r\nservice; but as a principle they would generally rejoin their troop on\r\npromotion. There can be no doubt in the minds of those who have\r\npractically studied the question, that the system is sound. A special\r\nStaff Corps is never large enough to supply the demands of an army in\r\nthe field for long, especially if the war is long and very active. The\r\nduties of a staff officer with an army actively engaged in the field,\r\nare so numerous and arduous that an _enormous number_ are used up in the\r\ncourse of a campaign; and when you have only the Staff Corps to draw\r\nfrom, the supply of practical officers is not equal to the demand. The\r\nFrench experienced this in the Crimean War. By educating a number of\r\nyoung officers endowed by nature with the qualifications indispensable\r\nto form an _efficient_ staff officer _on active service_, and by\r\nthrowing them back into their regiments, they leaven the mass, and form\r\na fund of selected and instructed officers from which can be drawn as\r\noccasion may require.--_Col. Crealock to Military Ed. Com._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CAVALRY BRIGADE SCHOOLS FOR OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The following memorandum gives an account of an order lately issued,\r\nregulating Officers’ Brigade Schools in the Austrian cavalry.\r\n\r\n  The object of the Cavalry Brigade schools will be to secure a supply\r\nof efficient riding masters throughout the service capable of giving\r\ngeneral instruction.\r\n\r\n  The Central Cavalry School will continue to be a higher military and\r\nscientific establishment, with (in addition to the theoretical education\r\nof the pupils) a course of instruction which insures a uniform system of\r\nequitation and of breaking horses. A certain number of its best pupils\r\nmay be transferred, after a year’s attendance, to the _Kriegs-Schule_,\r\nwith a view to their preparation for the staff.\r\n\r\n  Cavalry Officers’ Brigade Schools educate officers of that arm,\r\ntheoretically as well as practically, in all their duties. After the\r\ntermination of the autumn manœuvres one will be formed in each brigade.\r\nThe annual course lasts six months, and should begin on the 1st of\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n  It is the duty of the Brigadier to superintend the school, but it is\r\nalso that of commanding officers of regiments to inform themselves of\r\nthe progress of their officers, and consequently to visit it often.\r\n\r\n  Before the 15th of August the Brigadier proposes to the Minister of\r\nWar the station at which the school should be established, also the\r\nnames of the instructors and pupils. It rests with him to make all\r\narrangements for setting it in operation; and as his supervision must be\r\ncontinual, he should (whenever practicable) place it at the\r\nhead-quarters of his brigade. Above all, a covered riding school must be\r\nfitted up; then a drill ground, a manège with artificial fences, and a\r\nschool, and fencing-room. Whenever possible the men and horses must be\r\nin barracks.\r\n\r\n  The best qualified officer in the brigade, of the rank of\r\nlieutenant-colonel or major, is to be selected for Commandant, and each\r\nschool is to have two captains as instructors. One of them must have\r\ngone through the Central Cavalry School, and must have been reported as\r\nspecially qualified to give instruction; the second must be considered\r\none of the best horsemen in the brigade.\r\n\r\n  At the disposal of these officers there is the following staff:--one\r\nveterinary surgeon for instruction in the anatomy, diseases, and shoeing\r\nof horses; one sergeant in charge of the men and horses; one sergeant\r\nfor quartermaster’s duties and accounts; one farrier; three corporals;\r\none trumpeter; twelve men per regiment of the brigade; and the riders of\r\nthe horses attached to the school.\r\n\r\n  If there is an auditor (_Judge Advocate_) available, he attends\r\nregularly to explain the Articles of War and give lectures on military\r\nlaw. Should there be none, this duty devolves upon one of the captain\r\ninstructors.\r\n\r\n  Six officers from the rank of first lieutenant downwards are sent\r\nyearly from each regiment. Each of them brings with him, besides his own\r\nhorses, the one allowed him by Government. Every regiment sends six\r\nremount horses that have passed the first stage of breaking, and six\r\nthat have just joined.\r\n\r\n    The principal subjects of theoretical instruction are--1st,\r\nRegulations of the army; 2d, Tactics, particularly as referring to the\r\nhandling of cavalry; 3d, Field movements, and especially outpost duty,\r\nwhich are to be illustrated by examples from the history of war; the\r\npupils will also draw and describe a tract of country, and give written\r\nreports upon field operations; 4th, description of the anatomy and\r\ndiseases of horses, with their management and feeding both in the stable\r\nand the field; shoeing theoretical and practical, in all its details;\r\n5th, thorough practice in the use of cavalry weapons, a general\r\nacquaintance with the arms of the artillery and infantry of the\r\nprincipal military nations, and an accurate knowledge of those employed\r\nin the Imperial army; 6th, a general knowledge of field fortification\r\nand of the works to be executed by the Pioneer Corps in combination with\r\ncavalry; 7th, the study of tracts of country, extending to the\r\nobservation of roads, streams, coverts, and undulations; the correct\r\nreading and understanding of maps.\r\n\r\n  The practical branch of education at these schools has for its main\r\nobject the maintenance throughout the army of the best fundamental\r\nsystem of equitation, and the adoption of any improvements in the\r\ncavalry service in general which may appear advisable. To this is added\r\npractice in getting over long distances through every description of\r\ncountry, and in judging when and where halts should be made with most\r\nadvantage to single horsemen, or to detachments of troops. These marches\r\nare to be combined with patrolling, reconnaissances, and posting\r\npiquets, and are to be practiced once a week.\r\n\r\n  After every such march the pupils will send in a brief report and\r\nrough sketch, either next morning or within forty-eight hours, as may be\r\nordered. They are to practice making this sketch on horseback as well as\r\non foot. They must perfect themselves in gymnastics, and in fencing and\r\nsinglestick, both on foot and horseback.\r\n\r\n  The regulations issued to the Minister of War as to distribution of\r\nhours and reports will be strictly followed, and no deviation will be\r\npermitted except under particular circumstances. Sundays and holidays\r\nare observed. No leave of absence, except in cases of urgent necessity,\r\ncan be granted to either instructors or pupils during the course.\r\n\r\n  At the end of the season of instruction (_i.e._ at the end of March)\r\nthe Cavalry Officers’ Brigade School will be broken up; and all persons\r\nattached to it, and their horses, will return to their regiments.\r\n\r\n  EXPENDITURES ON MILITARY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n  The appropriation for Military Education in Austria for 1870, was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  For non-commissioned officers and men, 504,000 florins (40,320_l_).\r\n\r\n  For officers, 978,000 florins (78,284_l_).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Errata for Part III (Austria):\r\n  [Footnote 23]\r\n  Soldiers are, however, occasionally allowed to marry,\r\n    Soldiers, are,\r\n  6.

MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nBavaria, with a population in 1867 of 4,824,421, on an area of 29,347\r\nEnglish square miles, maintained in 1869-70, an armed force of 56,760\r\nmen on a peace footing, and of 92,500 when placed on a war footing.\r\n\r\nThe armed force consists of the permanent army, the army of reserve, and\r\nthe landwehr, or militia. The strength of the permanent army at the end\r\nof 1869 was as follows:--\r\n\r\n  16 Regiments of the line, each of 3 battalions,  28,304  men.\r\n  10 Battalions of Yager infantry,                  5,870   “\r\n  20 Regiments of cavalry, each of 5 squadrons,     7,290   “\r\n  52 Batteries of artillery, with train,            6,361   “\r\n  10 Companies of engineers, with train,            1,212   “\r\n  4 Companies of sanitary troops,                     624   “\r\n  6 Detachments of victualing troops,                 288   “\r\n                                                   ------\r\n  Total strength of permanent army,                49,449\r\n\r\nThe army of reserve numbered over 30,000 men, and is to be made more\r\nefficient. The landwehr is only organized in the large towns. The army\r\nis recruited by conscription. All men, from the age of 21 are liable to\r\nserve, but the sons of the nobility (_hohe adel_) are exempt, and they\r\nwith the sons of superior employés in the service of the state have the\r\nprivilege of entering the military school of cadets. Those who are drawn\r\nfor the army are held liable to active service for eleven years, but are\r\nkept under arms, when on the peace footing, only three years, passing\r\nthree years more in the Reserve when called out for actual training, and\r\nheld for service for the remaining five years in the landwehr. No\r\nsubstitutes are allowed.\r\n\r\nBy the treaties of 1870, in time of war, the supreme command of the army\r\nof Bavaria passes to the Emperor of Germany, and in the further\r\ndevelopment of the Imperial policy, the military system of Bavaria as\r\nwell as of the other German States, will be merged in that of Prussia.\r\nThe following account of the system of Military Education, as it was in\r\n1869, is taken from the Report of the Military Education Commission for\r\n1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MILITARY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are four establishments for Military Education in Bavaria--1. The\r\nCadet Corps. 2. The War School 3. The Artillery and Engineer School.\r\n4. The War Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE CADET CORPS.\r\n\r\nThe Cadet Corps was by a royal decree of May 14th, 1864, placed on the\r\nsame footing with regard to instruction and final examination as the\r\nReal Gymnasium, and by a further decree of April 2d, 1868, the\r\nsignification and value which are attached to an _Absolutorium_, or\r\ncertificate of final examination, of a Real Gymnasium, were equally made\r\nto apply to an _Absolutorium_ of the Cadet Corps.\r\n\r\nThere are three classes.\r\n\r\nFor admission into the first class, candidates must be acquainted with\r\nthe following subjects:\r\n\r\n  _Religious Instruction._--(_a._) For Catholics: First chapter on\r\nBelief (_von den Glauben_) with preceding introduction, from page 33 to\r\npage 96.\r\n\r\n  The larger Catholic Catechism for all Bavarian bishoprics.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) For Protestants: The heads of the Christian doctrine, with the\r\necclesiastical explanation of the same, as well as the most important\r\npassages of the Bible contained in the catechism.\r\n\r\n  _German._--Grammar: formation of sentences; change in the form of\r\nsentences; copying from dictation small stories, narratives, and\r\nletters; facility in orthography and correct punctuation.\r\n\r\n  _Latin._--Elementary rules: easy translations from Latin into German,\r\nand from German into Latin.\r\n\r\n  _French._--Tolerably correct reading.\r\n\r\n  _Mathematics._--Vulgar fractions; decimals; rule of three; interest;\r\nexercises in mental calculations.\r\n\r\n  _Geography._--Europe generally, and Germany in particular, with\r\nespecial regard to mountain chains and river districts.\r\n\r\n  _Caligraphy._--German and English characters.\r\n\r\n_Second Class._\r\n\r\nFor admission into the second class candidates must be acquainted with\r\nthe following subjects:\r\n\r\n  _Religious Instruction._--(_a._) For Catholics: A knowledge of the\r\nsecond chapter on the Commandments (_von den Geboten_), pages 100 to 159\r\ninclusive.\r\n\r\n  The larger catechism for all Bavarian bishoprics.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) For Protestants: All the knowledge obtained from the so-called\r\npreparatory instruction for confirmation (_Praeparanden-Unterricht_).\r\n\r\n  _German._--Same as in first class.\r\n\r\n  _Latin._--Syntax: verbal and written translations from German to\r\nLatin, and from Latin to German, out of Cornelius Nepos.\r\n\r\n  _French._--Grammar: translation; reading; orthography.\r\n\r\n  _Greek._--Syntax up to verbs in μι; written and verbal translations\r\nfrom German to Greek, and _vice versâ_. Greek characters.\r\n\r\n  _Mathematics._--System of weights and measures; fractions; decimals;\r\nmental arithmetic.\r\n\r\n  _History._--Greek and Roman history, including the period up to\r\nClovis, king of the Franks.\r\n\r\n  _Geography._--The world in general. Europe excepted.\r\n\r\n  _Caligraphy._--German and English characters.\r\n\r\n_Third Class._\r\n\r\nCandidates for immediate admission into the third class must not have\r\nexceeded their fifteenth year, and must produce certificates of all the\r\nclasses of the Latin school.\r\n\r\nAt their examination for admission they must show that they are\r\nacquainted with all the subjects required in the examinations for the\r\nfirst and second class; and also with the following subjects:\r\n\r\n  _Religious Instruction._--(_a._) For Catholics: A knowledge of the\r\nthird chapter on Means of Grace _(von den Gnadenmitteln)_, page 160 to\r\npage 228.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) For Protestants: Candidates must not only be thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the so-called preparatory instruction for confirmation,\r\nbut must have been confirmed.\r\n\r\n  _German._--Composition: translation from Cornelius Nepos. Reading\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n  _Latin._--Complete Syntax. Written and verbal translations from German\r\nto Latin; Cæsar’s Commentaries; select passages from Roman historians;\r\nprosody; versification.\r\n\r\n  _French._--Translations: German into French, and _vice versâ_;\r\northography and reading.\r\n\r\n  _Greek._--Rudiments of grammar.\r\n\r\n  _Mathematics._--Algebra; geometry.\r\n\r\n  _History._--German history (from Clovis, king of the Franks),\r\nespecially that of Bavaria.\r\n\r\n  _Geography._--Europe; including political and statistical relations.\r\n\r\n  _Caligraphy._--German and English characters.\r\n\r\n_Admission to the Army from the Cadet Corps._\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Cadet Corps--\r\n\r\n(_a._) Students who have obtained from the Examination Commission a\r\ncertificate of “especially qualified” are named candidates, first class,\r\nfor the rank of officer.\r\n\r\n(_b._) Students who have obtained a certificate of “qualified” are sent\r\nto a division of the army as candidates, second class, for the rank of\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nFurther, those who have displayed a “marked proficiency,” not only as\r\nregards scientific acquirements but also as regards conduct and military\r\ncapacity, maybe appointed by the Education Commission to the rank of\r\nsub-lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThese last, however, in common with the candidates mentioned under heads\r\n(_a._) and (_b._) are required, after six months’ service in a division\r\nof the army, to pass through the military scientific course in the War\r\nSchool, and at the end of the course to undergo an examination. The same\r\nconditions are alike in force for the young nobility entering the army\r\nfrom the _Pagerie_ with the _Absolutorium_ of a gymnasium.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE WAR SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nThere are two courses, viz.:--(_a._) The preparatory course. (_b._) The\r\nmilitary scientific course.\r\n\r\nAll persons desirous to obtain commissions as officers, whether\r\ncompelled to enter the army, or volunteers, must undergo the preparatory\r\ncourse at the War School, unless they are in possession of an\r\n_Absolutorium_ of a Latin or Real Gymnasium.\r\n\r\nCandidates for the preparatory course (_a._) must pass an examination\r\nfor admission, and as a qualification for admission must have served an\r\nentire year satisfactorily in a division of the army.\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of the preparatory course these students are named\r\ncandidates, second class, for the commission of officers, and as such\r\nenter the military scientific course.\r\n\r\nThe following enter the second course:\r\n\r\n(_a._) Students with the _Absolutorium_ of a Real Gymnasium, or coming\r\nfrom the _Pagerie_.\r\n\r\n(_b._) Students who passed the preparatory course successfully.\r\n\r\n(_c._) Those to whom military service is compulsory, and volunteers,\r\nboth possessing the _Absolutorium_ of a Bavarian gymnasium, and being\r\ndesirous to become officers. These candidates must, however, perform six\r\nmonths’ service satisfactorily, and on termination of this service they\r\nare named candidates, second class, for the commission of officers.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of the military scientific course there is a general\r\nexamination of all candidates before the “Commission of High Studies and\r\nExaminations,” and decision is given--\r\n\r\n(_a._) Respecting efficiency for the position of officer.\r\n\r\n(_b._) Respecting the army rank of those who have passed their\r\nexamination without reference to former rank (_Chargen-verhältnisse_).\r\n\r\nVery distinguished conduct before the enemy can alone exempt candidates\r\nfrom this examination.\r\n\r\nCandidates examined are classed by the above Commission under the\r\nfollowing heads; “_especially qualified_,” “_qualified_,” and “_not\r\nqualified_;” and no candidate for the commission of officer can be named\r\nofficer without the certificate of “_qualified_.”\r\n\r\nCandidates, who have shown the necessary efficiency to entitle them to\r\nbe appointed officers, are named candidates, first class, for the\r\ncommission of officer, or, in consequence of the diminished number of\r\nofficers in the active army, are promoted to be sublieutenants.\r\n\r\nOnly those candidates for the commission of officer, who have received\r\nthe certificate “especially qualified” in the above final examination of\r\nthe military scientific course, can present themselves for admission\r\ninto the War Academy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE ARTILLERY AND ENGINEER SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nIn this school, consisting of two courses, each lasting a year, an\r\nopportunity is afforded to all candidates, first class, for commissions\r\nas officers to devote themselves to technical military science, and to\r\npursue the special studies having reference to the military operations\r\nin question; and, in this school, only those candidates for the\r\ncommission of officer are received, who have successfully passed the\r\nmilitary scientific course, and who, at the examination passed before\r\nthe “Commission of High Studies and Examinations,” have been pronounced\r\n“_qualified_” not only to remain in the Artillery and Engineer regiment,\r\nbut especially qualified to enter the Artillery and Engineer School.\r\n\r\nImmediately after passing the second course of the War School, and\r\nbefore admission into the Artillery and Engineer School, these\r\ncandidates must serve six months in an Artillery or Engineer regiment.\r\n\r\nCandidates pass over from the first to the second course without a\r\ngeneral examination, and should a doubt exist respecting the efficiency\r\nof any of the candidates, such candidates will be required to undergo a\r\nspecial examination before the “Commission of High Studies and\r\nExaminations,” who will decide, in the case of such candidates, whether\r\nthey are to go through the course a second time, or retire from it.\r\n\r\nThe same regulations apply for the second course, and the appointments\r\nas sub-lieutenants of Artillery or Engineer students are determined\r\naccording to the number of officers required in those corps.\r\n\r\nCandidates for the Engineers are required, after passing through their\r\nschool, to undergo a six weeks’ course of design, during which period\r\neach candidate must without assistance make a complete Drawing of an\r\nedifice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE WAR ACADEMY.\r\n\r\nThe War Academy has for its object the higher scientific and practical\r\neducation of officers, in every branch of the military profession, on\r\nthe staff, as also of the higher adjutants. It aims also at the\r\ndevelopment of all military scientific subjects.\r\n\r\nThe War Academy has three courses, each lasting nine months, and the\r\nintervals are employed in practical exercises.\r\n\r\nThe number of students in one course must, as a rule, not exceed twelve,\r\nand every upper or sub-lieutenant who has served not less than four\r\nyears with the troops, can attend the academy.\r\n\r\nOfficers are only admitted into this school who possess the requisite\r\nknowledge of their respective branches of the military service.\r\n\r\nFurther, their conduct must have been highly satisfactory; they must be\r\nsound in health, and their pecuniary affairs must be in good order, and\r\nthey must combine prominent mental qualifications with a tendency to\r\nhigher scientific attainments.\r\n\r\nThe “Commission of High Studies and Examinations” decides by examination\r\nas to the necessary qualifications for admission; then follows a\r\nsummons, issued by the Ministry of War, to attend the War Academy, and\r\neach time only for one year.\r\n\r\nOfficers who, on the decision of the Examination Commission, do not\r\ndisplay sufficient capacity or zeal, or whose military behavior or moral\r\nconduct has not been satisfactory, will not be summoned to attend the\r\nnext course.\r\n\r\nThe scientific education of those admitted into the War Academy consists\r\nalso in--\r\n\r\n(_a._) Attending lectures at the University and the Central Polytechnic\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\n(_b._) Higher lectures upon military scientific subjects.\r\n\r\n(_c._) Exercises in living languages.\r\n\r\nThe practical education embraces the duties of staff officers and of\r\nhigher adjutants, acquaintance with the different branches of military\r\nservice, also corporal activity, and especially exercises on horseback.\r\n\r\nOfficers who, on the decision of the Examination Commission, have during\r\nthe three courses of the War Academy displayed zeal, talent, and\r\napplication, will, on leaving the academy, have their names sent in to\r\nthe King for especial notice.\r\n\r\nEach of the military schools has its own commandant. The Cadet Corps is\r\ncommanded by a First Lieutenant of Infantry, the War School by a Major\r\nof the Quartermaster-General’s Staff, the Artillery and Engineer School\r\nby a Major of the Engineer Staff, and the War Academy by a Colonel of\r\nthe General Staff, to whom an Adjutant is attached.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the systematic process of education pursued in the\r\nmilitary schools, and to the application of the different means employed\r\nto impart instruction, these establishments are placed under the\r\nsuperior direction of the “Inspection of Military Schools;” in all other\r\nrespects, they are under the control of the Ministry of War, and the\r\nprofessors employed in them are selected according to their special\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL MILITARY SCHOOL AT DRESDEN[1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Document.\r\n\r\n    _Bericht über_ (report on) _die Kgl. Turnlehrer Bildungsanstalt,\r\n    von Dr. Kloss_, 1864, pp. 34, (with a representation of the\r\n    grounds and buildings.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n1.--_Organization and Admission._\r\n\r\nThe Royal Military School at Dresden was reorganized in 1867, after the\r\nwar, and organized like the schools of the same rank in Prussia.\r\nFormerly it consisted of two separate schools, the artillery school and\r\nthe _Cadettencorps_, both completing the education of their pupils; but\r\nnow a higher academy in Prussia must be attended for finishing the\r\nprofessional education, either in Berlin, Erfurt, &c.\r\n\r\nBy the new “regulative,” the _Cadettencorps_ in Saxony consists of six\r\nclasses, and has (1,) 20 free scholars; (2,) 84 half-free scholars; (3,)\r\n20 not free scholars--in all, 124. Besides these, “volunteers” may be\r\nadmitted; but, if foreigners, without any claim to being admitted\r\nafterwards to the royal army.\r\n\r\nFor admission to any of the 124 places, the sons of officers of the\r\narmy, killed or invalid, or of such subalterns as have served 25 years,\r\nand of civil officers of high merits, are preferred to others.\r\n\r\nThe aspirant must have completed his 11th year of age, and not be over\r\n18 years of age.\r\n\r\nIn general the boys must have, if 11 years old, the requisite knowledge\r\nof Quinta; if 12, of Quarta; if 13, of Quarta; if 14, of Tertia; if\r\n15-17, of Secunda, of a gymnasium, (college.)\r\n\r\nOn admission, every pupil has to pay 100 thalers for a full equipment,\r\nfor books, &c.; and to bring with him 12 shirts, 18 pairs of stockings,\r\n18 handkerchiefs, 6 drawers, 1 pair of house shoes, 2 white cotton\r\nnight-jackets.\r\n\r\nDuring his stay every pupil has to pay, (besides 25 thalers for books\r\nwhen transferred to III,) annually, (_a_,) 50 thalers, if a free\r\nscholar; (_b_,) 110 if half free; (_c_,) 210 if not free; (_d_,) 260 if\r\na Saxon “volunteer;” and, (_e_,) 300 if a foreign “volunteer.”\r\n\r\n2.--_Course of Instruction._\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction in the Military School embraces six years,\r\nwith six classes, of which, as was said before, VI, (the last,) V, IV,\r\nand III correspond to V, IV, and III in a gymnasium, II and I to lower\r\nand upper Secunda, with the only difference, that instead of Greek,\r\ninstruction is given in English and in the elements of a military\r\neducation. It will be, therefore, sufficient to mention the course of\r\ninstruction in the highest class as given in the new regulation.\r\n\r\n  1. Religion. (The number of lesson hours is not stated.)\r\n\r\n  2. Latin: Written exercises; Livy, Ovid, Virgil.\r\n\r\n  3. German: History of literature; explanation of dramatic pieces; free\r\ndiscourses, with a verbal résumé, and debates.\r\n\r\n  4. French: Translations; extemporalia; compositions; exercises in\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n  5. Mathematics: Progressions; logarithms, and their application;\r\napplying of algebra to geometry; trigonometry; elements of stereometry.\r\n\r\n  6. English: Oral and written exercises; free discourses on historical\r\nand geographical subjects; review of the same in English; reading of\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n  7. History: Modern history; review of universal history; history of\r\nNorthern Germany.\r\n\r\n  8. Geography: Mathematical and physical geography; review of political\r\ngeography, with particular regard to Northern Germany.\r\n\r\n  9. Natural philosophy: Electricity, magnetism, sound and light.\r\n\r\n  10. Drawing of plans; finishing the designs of the survey.\r\n\r\n  11. Surveying: Topographical surveying on a large scale; drawing of\r\ngrounds; _croquiren_.\r\n\r\n  12. Free-hand drawing. (Not obligatory.)\r\n\r\nThose cadets to whom, in consequence of the examination at the end of\r\nthe course, the testimonial of maturity for ensigncy can be given, are\r\npresented to his Majesty as “characterized” ensigns, whilst all others\r\nwho do not answer the demands have to perform, in some other way, their\r\nlegal service in the army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  V. MILITARY SYSTEM AND EDUCATION IN HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe regular army of Holland is divided into two portions--one of which\r\ntakes all the ordinary duties of the Dutch possessions beyond the seas,\r\nwhile the other serves entirely in Europe. In the event of war, the Home\r\narmy is liable to be sent to the support of the Colonial army; but\r\nexcept in such emergency, the officers and men of each portion are as\r\ndistinct, almost, as though they composed parts of the military forces\r\nof two independent countries. The entire military force consists of the\r\nregular army of about 52,000 men, which can be swelled to twice that\r\nnumber in an emergency, by militia conscripts and reserve levies.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Colonial Army consists of regiments of cavalry and artillery,\r\nas well as of infantry, of which the depots for recruiting as well as of\r\narms, ammunition, and ordnance, are at home. But the service companies,\r\nwhen they have once embarked for their colonial stations, return no more\r\nas armed bodies--and even as individuals, neither officers nor men\r\nreturn until they have taken part in the avocations of colonial life.\r\n\r\nThe army of Holland, both in its European and colonial branches is\r\nrecruited by voluntary enlistment. The term of service is six years,\r\nbeyond which, however, the soldier not disqualified by loss of health,\r\nmay remain. The service is not particularly attractive; neither the pay\r\nbeing large, nor promotion from the ranks rapid, or certain, the\r\nrecruits are not drawn from the most intelligent, and enterprising\r\nclasses. Still, as discipline is strictly enforced, and the natural\r\ncourage of the Batavian race is good, there is seldom any outbreak or\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MILITARY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nThe officers, as a body, are well educated, and belong to the higher\r\nclass of society, and before admission to the service, they must prove\r\ntheir qualifications by a rigid examination, which is practically\r\ncompetitive, as promotion is determined by the order of merit, as shown\r\nin the results. Preparation for the examination could be made, till\r\nrecently, (1.) either by joining the Cadet Corps as a volunteer, and\r\nafter a specified term of service in the field, undergoing an\r\nexamination in the studies, and practical knowledge required; or (2.) by\r\ngoing successfully through a regular course in the Military Academy at\r\nBreda. The army is now officered exclusively from the graduates of the\r\nMilitary Academy.\r\n\r\nIII. MILITARY ACADEMY AT BREDA.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy at Breda, prepares officers for every branch of the\r\nservice, and is well equipped in respect to buildings, and appliances of\r\nillustration and practice, as well as with numerous professors for doing\r\nits work as thoroughly as any school can which receives its pupils so\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nWithin an extensive redoubt, separated from the town by a rampart and\r\nwet ditch, stands an old palace which the late King set apart as a\r\ncollege for officers. Here are good stables and an ample stud, a\r\nswimming school, and an extensive plateau, with cannon of every calibre,\r\nwhich supplies the means of drill applicable to each branch of service.\r\nThe accommodation within doors is excellent. Youths, sleeping in long\r\ndormitories, are yet separated one from another by curtains, within\r\nwhich stand each inmate’s iron bedstead, his little dressing-table, his\r\nbasin, jug, clothes-press, and all other matters necessary to\r\ncleanliness and comfort. There is a spacious hall or day-room, besides a\r\nconvenient dining-room, a good library, a well-stocked model-room, a\r\nsmall but judiciously selected museum of arms, with a good collection of\r\nminerals and fossils, of chemical and mechanical apparatus, &c. Finally,\r\nthe class-books used in the place are compiled and arranged by the\r\nprofessors, and, in every branch of science and learning touched by\r\nthem, appear well adapted to the purposes for which they are intended.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Breda Military Academy, when full,\r\nincludes--besides the Governor, a major-general, and the Commandant, a\r\ncolonel--an adjutant, a quarter-master, three captains of infantry,\r\nthree of artillery, one of engineers, one of cavalry; five first\r\nlieutenants of infantry, two of cavalry, three of artillery, one of\r\nengineers; two second lieutenants of infantry, one of cavalry, one of\r\nartillery, and two of engineers--two medical officers and an apothecary.\r\nThere are besides, of civilian professors and teachers, seven; and the\r\nplace is capable of accommodating one hundred and ninety-two cadets.\r\nThese, whether intended for the European or colonial branch of the\r\nservice, live and pursue their studies together. The course comprises\r\nfour years, during the first two of which, all the cadets are educated\r\ntogether without reference to the specific corps or services for which\r\nthey may be intended: but with the commencement of the third year, such\r\nas may be selected for the artillery or engineers pass into distinct\r\nclasses, while the remainder go on, by a less abstrusely scientific\r\ncourse, to commissions in the cavalry or infantry.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications for admittance into the Academy are not extravagantly\r\nhigh. Youths seem to be eligible who can read, write, and spell their\r\nown language correctly--who are able to construe an easy Latin author,\r\nand exhibit some acquaintance with the French; who are advanced in\r\narithmetic to vulgar fractions, can demonstrate an easy proposition in\r\ngeometry, and are masters of the fundamental processes of algebra.\r\nDuring the two first years all are well instructed in history,\r\ngeography, mathematics, fortification, the theory of projectiles,\r\nplan-drawing, the French and German languages. After this they break up,\r\nand pursue their peculiar studies in different rooms under different\r\nteachers. Their progress is tested by severe periodical examinations;\r\naccording to the results of which, they are either advanced or held\r\nback. But as no second trial is granted in the examination for\r\nadmittance, so two failures at any of the examinations which follow,\r\ninsure dismissal from the Academy. Finally, prayers are read daily to\r\nthe cadets in a large hall, where also, if the weather be unfavorable,\r\none of the ministers from the town attends on Sunday to celebrate public\r\nworship. When the weather is fine the young men march to\r\nchurch--Protestants under their own officers to a Protestant place of\r\nworship--Roman Catholics under like surveillance to a Roman Catholic\r\nchapel.\r\n\r\nAlthough the army is to some extent officered from the ranks for\r\nmeritorious service, or from those who have performed duty in the field\r\nunder a peculiar system of cadetship, as well as from the graduates of\r\nthe Military Academy, it is proper to add, that no promotion can be\r\nmade, or commission issued, until a satisfactory examination has been\r\npassed. The prospect of this examination keeps up the habit of\r\nprofessional study and reading, as well as a feeling of honorable\r\nrivalry among officers of the same grade.\r\n\r\nNAVIGATION SCHOOLS FOR THE MERCANTILE MARINE.\r\n\r\nThere are ten special Navigation Schools (besides a nautical division in\r\nthe Academy at Groningen) located in the principal commercial ports, and\r\namong the sea-going population. They are generally under the management\r\nof local mercantile societies, but subject to government inspection, and\r\nfinal examination, on which the rank of the graduates as first, second,\r\nand third mate, depends.\r\n\r\nThe pupils are admitted on examination in the elementary studies,\r\nphysical ability, and aptitude for sea-service.\r\n\r\nThe course in the best schools embraces, besides a review of the\r\nelementary branches, a knowledge of geography, especially of the climate\r\nand products of different countries; mathematics, including\r\ntrigonometry, nautical astronomy, practical use of instruments at sea,\r\nand the calculation of latitude and longitude, a knowledge of the code\r\nof signals, the laws of storms and tides, mercantile laws and usages,\r\nand practice in letter-writing, keeping the ship’s books, and\r\nchart-drawing.\r\n\r\nOpportunities of practice are secured on vessels in port, in coasters,\r\nand even long voyages to the West and East Indies.\r\n\r\nAbility to hold the rank of mates depends on the results of the final\r\nexamination, and promotion from one position to a higher depends on\r\nsuccessive examinations, after leaving the schools.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of attendance at these schools in 1867 were as follow:\r\n\r\nRotterdam, 133 pupils; Leyden, 87; Amsterdam, 87; Amsterdam, 18;\r\nHarlingen, 59; Nes, 19; Schiermonnikoog, 84; Vundam, 37; Groningen, 85;\r\nDelfzye, 68; Nautical section of the Groningen Academy, 39.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Erratum for Part IV (Bavaria):\r\n  Groningen, 85; Delfzye, 68;\r\n    _semicolon ; after “85” invisible_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  PART V.\r\n\r\n  MILITARY SYSTEM AND SCHOOLS IN ITALY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY SYSTEM AND INSTRUCTION IN ITALY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nAs the provinces, duchies, kingdoms, and dominions into which the\r\nterritory and population of old Italia, in the progress of centuries\r\nafter the utter destruction of the Western Empire, were divided by\r\nconquests, alliance and cessions of reigning families (brought and kept\r\nin power by force of armies), were merged, one after another, under the\r\ngovernment of the House of Savoy, the military system of Sardinia was\r\nextended over the entire kingdom of Italy as now recognized.\r\n\r\nThe actual strength of the Italian army as constituted in 1869, was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------\r\n                                    | Peace Footing.  | War Footing.\r\n  ----------------------------------+-----------------+----------------\r\n                                    |  Men.

A certain number, distinguished as “soldati\r\nd’ordinanza,” to which class belong the Carabinieri and some of the\r\nAdministrative troops, have to serve eight years complete, and are then\r\nliberated. In the army of reserve, the time of service is 5 years. Every\r\nnative of the kingdom is liable to the conscription, and to be enrolled\r\neither in the standing army or the reserve. An exemption in favor of\r\nyoung men studying for the priesthood, was repealed by a law which\r\npassed both houses of parliament in May, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the standing army over the kingdom was as follows in\r\nthe middle of 1869. There were 8 battalions of infantry at and near the\r\ncapital, 5 at Genoa, 5 at Turin, 9 at Alessandra, 12 in Tuscany, and 120\r\nin the valley of the Po, from Milan to Ancona. The troops in the valley\r\nof the Po were supported by 24 squadrons of heavy and 36 squadrons of\r\nlight cavalry, and 248 pieces of artillery. At Naples there were 18\r\nbattalions of the line, 2 of marines, and 3 of bersaglieri; in the\r\nNeapolitan provinces, 39 battalions of the line, 20 of bersaglieri, and\r\n32 squadrons of cavalry. There were, finally, 32 battalions of the line\r\nin Sicily.\r\n\r\nII. NAVY.\r\n\r\nThe navy of the kingdom of Italy consisted, at the commencement of 1869,\r\nof 99 ships of war, armed with 1,032 guns. They were classed as follows:\r\n\r\n      Steamers.

EDUCATION OF OFFICERS.\r\n\r\nThe system of military education of the old kingdom of Sardinia has been\r\nenlarged and extended by the government of the Kingdom of Italy so as to\r\nembrace the military schools of Naples, without any change in its\r\nprinciples or details.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY SYSTEM AND EDUCATION IN SARDINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. GENERAL OUTLINE OF MILITARY SYSTEM, AND MILITARY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nThe wars in which Sardinia has recently been engaged, have led to the\r\nre-organization of her armies, and to the extension and improvement of\r\ninstitutions for military instruction, but time enough has not yet\r\nelapsed to perfect the system.\r\n\r\nOne-third of the officers are promoted from the ranks; the remaining\r\ntwo-thirds, that is, all who enter as officers, must pass through the\r\nRoyal Military Academy, and before being commissioned as Captain in the\r\nArtillery and Engineers, must have completed the special course in the\r\nComplementary School. Admission to the Royal Staff Corps is conditioned\r\non attendance on the lectures of the Staff School, and the results of a\r\ncompetitive examination. The following is a brief outline of the system\r\nof military instruction now in operation.\r\n\r\n1. The character of the education may be described generally as partly\r\nresembling that of Austria, partly that of France. It commences very\r\nearly. Every Officer who enters the Army as such must have passed\r\nthrough the great Military School, the _Accademia Militare_. The minimum\r\nage of entrance is fourteen. The admission is by nomination and not by\r\ncompetition; and the demand has always been under rather than above the\r\nrequirements of the Army. “Bourses” or Exhibitions to assist pupils in\r\ntheir education, have been established on the Prussian and Austrian,\r\nrather than on the French principle. They are granted by the King on the\r\nrecommendation of the Minister, in consideration of the claims of\r\ndeceased Officers, or other public servants, and without reference to\r\nthe merits of the pupils, preference being given to the candidates whose\r\ncircumstances most require assistance. From twenty-five to thirty of\r\nthese _Bourses_ (or rather _Demibourses_, for no pupils receive entire\r\nsupport such as is given in France,) are given annually. We are informed\r\nthat a decree will appear almost immediately, throwing open _ten_ out of\r\nthis number to public competition. The entire sum expended upon them is\r\n70,000 francs, about 2,800_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nPassing from this outline of the principles of Sardinian Military\r\nEducation, as exhibited in the _Accademia Militare_, which may be termed\r\nthe General Seminary of the Sardinian Army, we shall briefly allude to\r\nthe _three_ remaining Institutions, in which Officers receive\r\ninstruction and training at later periods of their career.\r\n\r\n2. Admission into the Artillery and Engineer School may be considered\r\nthe reward of the most distinguished pupils of the _Accademia Militare_,\r\nwho after spending their last year in that Institution in the study of\r\nthe higher mathematics, chemistry, and architectural drawing, are\r\ntransferred for the completion of their education to the School of the\r\nArtillery and Engineers.\r\n\r\n3. The Staff School, the formation of which dates from 1850, is chiefly\r\nfrequented by Officers of the Infantry and Cavalry, who must be below\r\nthe age of twenty-eight years upon their entrance. It is carried on upon\r\nthe competitive system, the Officers being ranged according to merit in\r\ntheir Final Examination, the ablest entering the Staff Corps in that\r\norder.\r\n\r\n4. Regimental Schools for Officers also exist, and in every Brigade or\r\nDivision, Officers are taught _topography_, under the supervision of the\r\nChief of the Staff of the Division. Care is taken to make this teaching\r\nuniform throughout the Army; and it may be regarded as preparatory to\r\nthat of the Schools at Ivrea and Pinerol, which accord with the\r\nprinciple of the Prussian Division Schools in requiring that every\r\nOfficer shall have received professional instruction; but as regards\r\nother points, and particularly the period for attending them, these\r\nSchools are peculiar to the Sardinian Army. In time of peace, no\r\nOfficer, excepting those of the Special Arms, can obtain a Company\r\nwithout having studied for a year in one or the other of these Schools,\r\nand having passed an examination on leaving it. The Instruction given is\r\nmainly practical, Field Fortification, the Secondary Operations of War,\r\nand Topography, being the branches of Military Science taught.\r\n\r\nThese Institutions appear to have been _primarily_ established with a\r\nview to the instruction of Officers and Non-commissioned Officers\r\nthroughout the Army, and in order to prevent Regiments or Corps from\r\nfollowing some peculiar system of their own. The same motive seems to\r\nhave led to the gradual reduction in number of the Prussian Division\r\nSchools. _Secondarily_, however, these Schools have been made available\r\nfor the purpose of organizing and drilling the reserve of the Sardinian\r\nArmy, a large body of Conscripts assembled for a few weeks in the autumn\r\nof each year in a camp about twelve miles from Turin. This object seems\r\nto have been attained most successfully.\r\n\r\nQuite recently a class has been added to the school at Ivrea for the\r\nexclusive education of Non-commissioned Officers aspiring to a\r\ncommission; and for the sake of economy this class is to be common to\r\nInfantry and Cavalry.\r\n\r\nIt is consequently from this body of officers that teachers are derived\r\nfor the topographical classes established in each Regiment or Brigade.\r\nThe Staff School having been recently founded, and a period of active\r\nwar having intervened since its institution, can not be supposed to have\r\ncompletely organized its system of instruction. We have elsewhere\r\nmentioned that Topography, the Art of War, and Fortification, are the\r\nbranches of military study most attended to; but we have reason to\r\nbelieve that its plan of instruction will be extended. It may not be\r\nsuperfluous to mention the high appreciation in Sardinia of the Austrian\r\nGeneral Staff, as tending to confirm our own estimate of the excellence\r\nof the Austrian Staff School. We have been recently informed, on the\r\nbest authority, that some of the most distinguished Sardinian Officers,\r\nwho, from their service in the Crimea and elsewhere, have been able to\r\ncompare the merits of different Staff Corps, consider the Austrian\r\nGeneral Staff “the best in existence.”\r\n\r\nAs regards the System of Examinations, there is a Standing Board\r\nconsisting of from _five_ to _seven_ Officers, presided over by a\r\nLieutenant-General, which superintends all the more important\r\nExaminations of the Military Schools, such as those upon leaving the\r\nSchool, &c. The constant Examinations within the School, when the Cadets\r\nare being moved from one class to another, are conducted by the\r\nProfessors.\r\n\r\nThe expense of Military Education in the Sardinian States amounts to\r\n18,000_l._ annually. The Military Schools are all under the direction of\r\nthe Minister of War.\r\n\r\n5. Two Institutions peculiar to the Sardinian Service are the _Schools\r\nfor Officers_, one or other of which it is necessary that every Officer\r\nunder ordinary circumstances should attend for a year before being\r\npromoted to the rank of Captain. One of these is for the Infantry, at\r\nIvrea; the other for the Cavalry, at Pinerol. In saying that _every_\r\nOfficer must attend these Schools, we except that proportion of\r\n_one-third_ who are promoted annually from the ranks, and whose\r\nattendance apparently has not hitherto been required.\r\n\r\nDetails respecting the organization and instruction of these schools\r\nwill be found under the following heads.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE ROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY AT TURIN.\r\n\r\nThe _Accademia Militare_ was originally designed by Charles Emanuel, for\r\nthe instruction of sons of officers of the army and of the nobility in\r\nthe use of weapons, in horsemanship, dancing, mathematics, and\r\nbelles-lettres. In the course of time, the institution was converted to\r\nits present purpose, of training Officers for the Sardinian Army.\r\n\r\nThe regular course of study in this school lasts apparently for six\r\nyears, shortly to be reduced to five years, and the earliest age at\r\nwhich it is _possible_ now to enter is fourteen, the _usual_ age of\r\nadmission being fifteen or sixteen. Formerly, boys entered at eleven and\r\ntwelve, but this practice has lately been altered, to the regret of many\r\nOfficers, who prefer the plan so commonly adopted abroad, of training\r\nOfficers to their business as soldiers from very early years.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of this school is that during a portion of the course it\r\neducates Officers for all Arms in common. The most talented pupils are\r\nthen selected by examination for the Artillery and Engineers, which are\r\nthe two favorite services, and indeed the most aristocratic corps in the\r\nSardinian army. The number of the pupils is limited to 200, but it is\r\nrarely complete; at present there are 180 pupils. About half of these\r\npay for themselves a yearly sum of 1,200 francs, 48_l._, the remaining\r\nhalf are supported, or partly supported by the Government. The system of\r\n_demi-bourses_ prevails here as in France.\r\n\r\nThe pupils are divided into four classes, according to the years of the\r\ncourse; a fifth class, contains those who have been just selected for\r\nthe Artillery and Engineers, who work by themselves, chiefly at the\r\nhigher kinds of drawing and the Differential and Integral Calculus, and\r\nMechanics. These senior pupils are Officers, and have each their\r\nseparate room. German is taught, and there is a Course of Italian\r\nLiterature, &c., but no Latin is taught in any part of the school. The\r\nsystem of working (at least with the higher boys) is in rooms where\r\neight or ten are united, and apparently there is something of the\r\n_Répétiteur_ system.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements of the house are excellent. The pupils appear to be\r\nstrictly confined to barracks during the week, but allowed to go out on\r\nSundays. The discipline is said to have been relaxed of late years, and\r\nthis is attributed by old Officers to a cause which will appear curious\r\nin England, viz., to the pupils having _any_ holidays at all. This\r\ninnovation upon the simplicity of the Piedmontese system of education\r\nwas alleged to have encouraged distinctions between the richer and\r\npoorer pupils, and thus to have injured both the economy and the\r\n_Camaraderie_ of the school. Great stress was laid here, as at other\r\nMilitary Institutions, on a strictness of discipline very unusual in\r\nEngland. The boys begin their work at half-past five o’clock, and work\r\ntill seven; then they go to chapel for a short time, and breakfast and\r\nrecreation follow immediately after. Both are concluded by eight, when\r\nthey return to their studies for an hour and a quarter; then a quarter\r\nof an hour’s relaxation is allowed, and the studies are resumed until\r\neleven o’clock. An hour is then devoted to the schools of fencing,\r\nriding, gymnastics, or dancing. From twelve to a quarter before two\r\no’clock is allotted to dinner and recreation, and then another hour is\r\nspent in the fencing, riding, gymnastic, or dancing schools. A quarter\r\nof an hour’s recreation is again granted, and from three to half-past\r\nfour o’clock study is resumed. A quarter of an hour’s recreation\r\nfollows, and half an hour is then given to military exercises, succeeded\r\nby another quarter of an hour’s interval for rest. Two hours are then\r\ndevoted to study--from half-past five to half-past seven o’clock. An\r\nhour is afterwards allowed for chapel, supper, and retiring to rest.\r\n\r\nA monthly account is taken of their work, and the marks then given\r\nexercise an influence upon their places in the examinations which take\r\nplace every year.\r\n\r\nThe following tables give a full view of the work of the pupils during\r\ntheir six years’ course.\r\n\r\n  DISTRIBUTION OF THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF

ARTILLERY AND ENGINEER SCHOOL AT TURIN.\r\n\r\nThe _Artillery and Engineer School_ (_Scuola Complementaria_,) which is\r\nestablished in a large building in one of the suburbs of Turin, is a\r\nSchool of Application, intended to complete the special education of the\r\nYoung Officers of the Artillery and Engineers, which the Cadets of those\r\nCorps have previously entered upon during their four last years in the\r\n_Accademia Militare_. Its course of studies occupies nominally two\r\nyears, but really only eighteen months, after which the final\r\nexaminations begin, and the pupils receive leave of absence. The\r\nStudents do not live in barracks here, but the Inspector of the School\r\nseemed to think it desirable that they should do so. The exercises of\r\nthe day commence, at eight o’clock every morning, with an hour’s riding.\r\nA lecture then follows, which lasts for an hour and a half, from nine\r\ntill half-past ten. The rest of the morning is left free till twelve\r\no’clock, when the pupils return to the school till three, and where they\r\nstudy together in large classes in the same room; they have afterwards\r\nsome military exercises till five, and are then free for the evening.\r\n\r\nThe number of pupils at the school is twenty; from ten to fifteen for\r\nthe Artillery, the rest for the Engineers. The subjects of study will\r\nshow what difference exists in the studies of the two Corps, and we were\r\ntold that very little preference was shown in the choice of the Students\r\nfor one over the other. The Engineers do not appear to be at all\r\nemployed in civil works; indeed, the Government does not allow them to\r\nbe so, as there are sufficient fortifications in the kingdom of Sardinia\r\nto afford them constant employment. The pay of the two Corps is equal,\r\nand is very little above that of the Infantry, and the same as that of\r\nthe Cavalry. The Artillery and Engineers (the _Armi dotti_) appear to be\r\ndecidedly the favorite and aristocratic corps of the Sardinian army.\r\nThey rarely enter the Staff Corps, and the reason assigned for this is\r\ntheir unwillingness to quit their own arm of the service. The position\r\nof the pupils on entering the Corps is fixed by the Final Examination\r\nalone, and is not influenced by marks previously given for industry and\r\napplication during the course, as is the case in some of the French and\r\nGerman schools--at the Polytechnic, for instance, and at Znaim. The only\r\nvalue of a high position in the Final Examination is that it gives\r\nseniority in the Corps.\r\n\r\nThe direction of the school is intrusted to a Field Officer of\r\nArtillery, assisted by two Captains, one from the Artillery, and the\r\nother from the Engineers. His authority extends to instruction and\r\ndiscipline.\r\n\r\nThe scientific instruction is given by professors (effective and\r\nsupplementary) and by Officers belonging to the various Artillery\r\ndivisions and establishments, who, together, constitute a Council of\r\nInstruction, of which the Director is President.\r\n\r\nThe examinations to which the Officer Students are subjected are held by\r\na Commission, nominated by the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n_Regulations respecting the Professors, &c._\r\n\r\n  The Professors and Instructors are personally responsible for the\r\nteaching of the subjects contained in the programmes and regulation for\r\nthe discipline of the students in School, for the daily drawing up of\r\nthe notes and execution of the drawings, and for the constant presence\r\nof the students during the time of the instructions and lectures.\r\n\r\n  The Military Professors and Instructors will maintain constantly among\r\nthe students the spirit of subordination and military discipline in all\r\nits force.\r\n\r\n  The Professors not possessed of military rank, when reproof is not\r\nsufficient to keep the students to their duty, will report the matter to\r\nthe Director and to the Captains attached to the direction of the\r\nSchool, in order that more vigorous measures may be adopted.\r\n\r\n  At the beginning of every lecture, the Professors will satisfy\r\nthemselves that the students have finished the notes preceding it, and\r\nthe regulated tasks and drawings.\r\n\r\n  The Professors will also have the power of visiting with arrest\r\nstudents who are negligent in the execution of the notes and tasks, and\r\nthose who exhibit a constant indisposition to work, reporting it to the\r\nDirector of the School.\r\n\r\n  When the lectures are upon difficult subjects, it is the duty of the\r\nProfessors sometimes to visit the students during the hours of study,\r\nfor the purpose of explaining difficulties.\r\n\r\n  At the beginning of every lecture, the Professors will dictate to the\r\nstudents a summary of the lesson which they are about to explain.\r\n\r\n  At the commencement of their course of lectures, they will point out\r\nto the students the books and treatises to be followed.\r\n\r\n  At fixed intervals, as they shall judge it most convenient, the\r\nProfessors will suspend the course of their lectures to satisfy\r\nthemselves by questions of the attention given and the progress made by\r\nthe students.\r\n\r\n  At the opening of their course, the Professors will notify to the\r\nDirector of the School the hours which suit their engagements best for\r\nthe giving of the lectures; these hours will be subsequently maintained\r\nunchanged throughout the duration of their course. These hours can only\r\nbe selected out of those fixed in the general time table.\r\n\r\n  In case of any lectures having to take place out of the lecture-rooms\r\nof the School, they will give notice in time to the Director.\r\n\r\n  If they should consider any change in the programme necessary, they\r\nwill give notice in writing to the Director of the School, so that he\r\nmay be able to submit their propositions to the General Commandant.\r\n\r\n  The Instructors will exact of the students, in the execution of the\r\npractical instructions and in the explanation of them, a demeanor\r\nperfectly military, and a tone of voice appropriate to the circumstance.\r\nAll the students, without exception, should render themselves capable of\r\nexecuting the practical tasks and explanations now mentioned with the\r\ngreatest perfection.\r\n\r\n  The Professors, as well as Instructors, in concluding their course of\r\nlectures, will transmit to the Director of the School a statement\r\nshowing the degree of instruction acquired by the students, and their\r\nconduct in School; the credit for the instruction and for conduct will\r\nbe given by means of two distinct integral numbers, selected from two to\r\nten.\r\n\r\n_Duration of the Course and Subjects._\r\n\r\n  The course of the Complementary School will be terminated in a year\r\nand a half.\r\n\r\n  The students belonging to two successive promotions will participate\r\nin the same instructions during the last six months of the first course,\r\nand the first six of the second course.\r\n\r\n  The subjects which will be taught to the Officer-students of the\r\nComplementary School are,--\r\n\r\n    _a._ Mineralogy and metallurgy.\r\n    _b._ Introduction to applied mechanics, and application of mechanics\r\n    to machinery.\r\n    _c._ Theory of the combustion of powder; of the movement inside the\r\n    bore; of the resistance of ordnance; of the volume, weight, and\r\n    center of gravity of ordnance; projectiles.\r\n    _d._ Use of artillery in war, construction of batteries, service in\r\n    the field.\r\n    _e._ Permanent fortification.\r\n    _f._ _Course of construction and of military and civil }\r\n    architecture_.                                         }\r\n    _g._ _Topography._                                     }\r\n    _h._ _Geodesy._                                        }\r\n        { For Engineer-Officers only. }\r\n    _i._ Military bridges and passage of water.\r\n    _l._ Classified nomenclature, and drawing of artillery materials.\r\n    _m._ Manufacture of powder, fire-works, arms, ordnance.\r\n\r\n_Practical Instructions._\r\n\r\n  Practical instruction will be given every day to the students of the\r\nComplementary School.\r\n\r\n  The object of this instruction is to render the Officers themselves\r\nfamiliar with the execution of the operations, and with the proper\r\nmethod of instructing Non-commissioned Officers and soldiers of\r\nArtillery.\r\n\r\n  These instructions, which will be, as far as possible, executed and\r\nexplained by the Officers of the School, will consist of--\r\n\r\n    Gymnastics.\r\n\r\n    Riding, according to the regulations in force.\r\n\r\n    The pack of the infantry soldier, armament, infantry instruction.\r\n\r\n    Classified nomenclature of the various parts of horse furniture,\r\nconvenient adaptation of them; pack of the cavalry soldier.\r\n\r\n    Principles of the physiology of the horse, and of veterinary\r\nscience; care of horses.\r\n\r\n    Nomenclature and use of the field, mountain, siege, garrison, and\r\ncoast material.\r\n\r\n    Lading of field and siege carriages, and mountain mules.\r\n\r\n    Service of field, mountain, siege, garrison, and coast artillery.\r\n\r\n    Driving and sectional drill, battery and brigade drill.\r\n\r\n    Regulations for marches, encampments.\r\n\r\n    Charges and compositions in use in the field, in sieges, and in\r\ngarrisons.\r\n\r\n    Judging distance drill, practice; remedies applied to materials in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE STAFF SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nThe Staff School at Turin has only existed since the year 1850.\r\nPreviously to that time the Staff was supplied by picked scholars from\r\nthe _Accademia Militare_.\r\n\r\nThe whole Staff Corps of the Sardinian Army only consists of thirty-six\r\nOfficers, viz., twenty-four Captains, and twelve of higher rank; no one\r\nof a lower rank than Captain being admitted even as attached to the\r\ncorps, a regulation which appeared to be considered inconvenient.\r\n\r\nOfficers are required to have served four years before their admission,\r\nas is the case in the Austrian Staff Schools, and they must not have\r\nexceeded their twenty-eighth year. Again, as in Austria, the Officers on\r\nleaving the school are ranged strictly in the order of merit, as tested\r\nby a final examination; and the ablest obtain appointments to the Staff\r\nin the same order. The Sardinian School has, however, some\r\npeculiarities, partly arising from the higher position which the Special\r\nArms (_Armi dotti_) of Artillery and Engineers hold in Sardinia than in\r\nAustria or Prussia. The method of admission is as follows:--\r\n\r\nAn Officer requests his Colonel to recommend him for admission to the\r\nStaff School. Great caution seems to be observed in giving this\r\nrecommendation; but having obtained it, an Officer has no further\r\ndifficulty in entering the School. In consequence of the small numbers\r\nof the Staff Corps, the demand for entrance is not very great, and there\r\nis accordingly no competitive examination. The numbers in the School\r\nhave, during the first five years of existence, varied greatly--from\r\nfourteen or sixteen to four or six. A year (or rather eleven months) is\r\nthe time occupied by the studies; the first six months being given to\r\ntheory, the last five to practice. The time thus occupied lasts from ten\r\ntill three in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe amount of knowledge required for admission into the School is\r\nstated, in the “Note” of Colonel Petitti, to be an acquaintance with\r\nGeometry and Algebra, as far as Equations of the Second Degree.\r\n\r\nThe practical work consists in the usual surveys of countries, plans,\r\n&c. The young Officers are taken by the Inspecting Colonel of the School\r\ninto the country, and worked hard for four or five months. There have\r\nhitherto been only places for one or two of these Officers on the Staff\r\nat the end of the year, and these (as has been already mentioned) have\r\nalways been the most distinguished pupils of the School. The rest become\r\nteachers in the regimental schools. Officers leaving the Staff School do\r\nnot appear to have a right to a step immediately (as in Austria) by\r\nvirtue of their having been at the School; but the Sardinian system of\r\nmaking all the appointments above the rank of Major by selection gives\r\nthem a prospect of advancement. Examinations are held in the School\r\nevery three months, at which the Professors give marks of proficiency;\r\nthese are combined with those obtained in the final examinations in\r\ndetermining the position of the pupils.\r\n\r\nThe Professors in the Staff School are all military men. The building is\r\nvery good, and, although small, contains a library, instruments, museum,\r\nand all the apparatus for maps.\r\n\r\nAmong the conditions which must be met favorably to be admitted to the\r\nRoyal Staff Corps are the following:--\r\n\r\n  _Physique:_--\r\n\r\n  If the constitution is robust, sufficiently strong, or weak.\r\n\r\n  If the sight is good, acute, or short.\r\n\r\n  _Intellectual Qualities:_--\r\n\r\n  If the intelligence is prompt, clear, reflective, and the mind orderly\r\nor confused.\r\n\r\n  If he is ready of speech, or uncommunicative.\r\n\r\n  _Moral Qualities:_--\r\n\r\n  If he is honorable, and of a good disposition, with much or little\r\nexpansion of character.\r\n\r\n  If of conciliatory or rough manners.\r\n\r\n  If peaceable, quick, or irascible.\r\n\r\n  If active, resolute, authoritative, timid, or feeble.\r\n\r\n  _Education:_--\r\n\r\n  What degree of instruction he has arrived at in mathematics, in the\r\ntheory and practice of surveying.\r\n\r\n  What ability in plan-sketching and topographical drawing.\r\n\r\n  If he cultivates any other branch of knowledge connected or\r\nunconnected with the Institute itself, and what.\r\n\r\n  If he is master of the Italian and French languages, so as to speak\r\nand write them with facility and correctness.\r\n\r\n  If he is acquainted with, and if he can speak, other languages.\r\n\r\n  If he is addicted to study.\r\n\r\n  _Conduct:_--\r\n\r\n  If his behavior is dignified, as becomes a soldier and a citizen.\r\n\r\n  If he enjoys the good-will of his superiors, the esteem of his\r\ncomrades and inferiors.\r\n\r\n  _Mode of discharging his Duty:_--\r\n\r\n  If he discharges his duty with exactness and zeal, or remissly and\r\nill.\r\n\r\n  _Particular Aptitude:_--\r\n\r\n  If he is more especially fitted for the duties of the surveying,\r\ntopographical, or military branch of the service.\r\n\r\n  If he has shown aptitude for teaching.\r\n\r\n  If he is adapted for progress in the Corps, or in the Infantry or\r\nCavalry services.\r\n\r\n  _Miscellaneous Information:_--\r\n\r\n  N.B.--Under this head will be inserted those notices which, finding no\r\nplace under the preceding heads, contribute towards a fuller information\r\nrespecting those Staff Officers who, in consequence of circumstances and\r\nduties special and unconnected with the service of the corps, may afford\r\nground for special mention.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. REGIMENTAL SCHOOLS OF IVREA AND PINEROL.\r\n\r\nThe requirement of professional study from Officers after entrance into\r\nthe Army is a point almost peculiar to the Sardinian service. The\r\n_principle_ of the Prussian Division School is, indeed, almost the same\r\nas that of the two Schools we are about to describe; but the examination\r\nfor which the Division Schools prepare is a qualification for obtaining\r\na commission, and not (like that of the Sardinian Schools) for\r\nsubsequent promotion. And this difference is partly owing to an obvious\r\ncause, the slowness of promotion in the Prussian Service. If the\r\nDivision Schools and their examination were placed before the promotion\r\nto a Captaincy, the candidates attending the School would be in most\r\ncases nearly forty years of age.\r\n\r\nSome instruction in Topography is given to the Officers of every\r\nRegiment in the Sardinian Army, under the direction of the Chief of the\r\nStaff of the Division. Care is taken to render the teaching uniform\r\nthroughout the Army, and it may be considered as a preparation for the\r\nmore systematic instruction given in the Schools of Ivrea and Pinerol.\r\nThe former of these is intended for the Infantry; the latter for the\r\nCavalry. Every Officer, excepting those of the Special Arms, must have\r\npassed a year of study in one or other of these Schools, as well as a\r\nsubsequent examination, before he can obtain a Captaincy.\r\n\r\nThe studies are mainly practical, as may be seen from the “Prospectus of\r\nInstruction” annexed. Topography, Field Fortification, and Secondary\r\nOperations are the only branches of Military Science in which\r\ninstruction is given; and upon these much care appears to be bestowed.\r\n\r\nOne-third of the Officers of the Sardinian Army are promoted, as has\r\nbeen mentioned, from the ranks. Accordingly, a class has been recently\r\nadded to the School of Ivrea, intended exclusively for the Education of\r\nthose Non-commissioned Officers who aspire to a Commission. This class\r\nis to be common to Infantry and Cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from the Regulations of the Minister of War, will\r\nexhibit the practical character of instruction in this class of schools.\r\n\r\n_Prospectus of Instruction to be given to Lieutenants in the Military\r\nSchool of Infantry_.\r\n\r\n  Soldiers’ Drill, Squad, Company, Battalion, and Chasseur ditto, &c.\r\n  Fencing with the Bayonet.\r\n  Exercise of the various Arms, &c.\r\n  Musketry Practice.\r\n  Regulations of Discipline, Garrison and Field Regulations,\r\n    Army Accounts.\r\n  Secondary Operations of War.\r\n  Topography.\r\n  Field Fortification.\r\n\r\n_School of Topography._\r\n\r\nIt is decided that such instruction [in Topography,] shall take place\r\nfrom the commencement of March till the end of July.\r\n\r\nThis will be obligatory on Officers who have not passed the age of\r\nthirty years.\r\n\r\nThose Corps, however, who may think that they can thus employ themselves\r\nin the winter also for the hour or so which may remain over after the\r\nother occupations of the Officers, shall have the power of establishing,\r\nfrom the beginning of November, a school, in which drawing and other\r\npreliminary acquirements may be taught.\r\n\r\nThis School will be attended especially by beginners and the less\r\neducated, who will thus be able better to profit at the beginning of\r\nMarch by the lectures given to the Officers more advanced in this study.\r\n\r\nThe Schools will be instituted for regiments or brigades, according as\r\nthe General commanding the Division shall determine, upon the report of\r\nthe Chief of the Staff, regard being had to the Director who can be\r\nassigned to them and the opportunities afforded by the situation.\r\n\r\nIn cases, however, where it may be convenient, they can institute\r\nDivisional Schools as well, which will be attended by the Officers of\r\nthe different corps already more advanced in the study.\r\n\r\nThere they will be exercised, by direction of the Chief of the Staff, in\r\nthe various subjects taught in the School, especially in the application\r\nupon sketches of themes of secondary operations of war, and will be\r\ntaken into the field to execute surveys on the spot with the instruments\r\nand by the eye.\r\n\r\nIn this case, in the Regimental Schools, the less educated officers will\r\nbe trained under the direction of Officers who have given proof of\r\nsufficient capacity.\r\n\r\nThe Officers of the Detachments of Cavalry or of the Rifles, for whom it\r\nmay not be convenient to establish separate schools, will attend those\r\nschools of their garrison to which they are assigned by the General\r\nCommandant of the Division upon the proposition of the Chief of the\r\nStaff.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as this Ministry is careful to provide the Schools of\r\nTopography with the instruments necessary for the practical training\r\nupon the ground, it makes known henceforward the implements with which\r\nthey must be provided, at the charge of the Treasury, in cases where\r\nthey do not already possess them, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  Small tables, with desks. Seats or stools. Slate, with stand. 2 pieces\r\nof Indian ink. 2 ditto of French blue. 2 ditto of gum. 2 tablets of\r\ncarded wool. 1 case of mathematical instruments. 2 plane rulers of one\r\nmetre each, besides some rulers of various dimensions, the necessary\r\npaper for themes, &c. 2 pen-knives. Some pencils. 1 paper of steel pens\r\nfor drawing. Half a bundle of crows’-quills. Chalk for the slate, and\r\nsponge. Inkstand, with ordinary ink. 2 crayons (_coulé_) of No. 2. 2\r\nditto of No. 4. 2 pieces of Indian rubber.\r\n\r\n  GENERAL SYLLABUS OF INSTRUCTION FOR THE INFANTRY OF THE LINE.\r\n\r\n  _Months of November, December, January, February and March._\r\n\r\n  Recruits will be kept separate from the seniors during these five\r\nmonths in all the instructions (except the drills.)\r\n\r\n  They will be instructed progressively once a day in soldiers’ and\r\nsquad drill.\r\n\r\n  They will attend daily the gymnastic exercise and the school of\r\nreading and writing.\r\n\r\n  N.B. As they shall progress by degrees in the various branches of\r\ninstruction, they will take their part in the service, at first on duty\r\nwhere arms are not required, and afterwards with their arms, as much as\r\npossible always upon public holidays.\r\n\r\n  Seniors will have to attend the school of reading, writing,\r\narithmetic, and gymnastics daily.\r\n\r\n  The recruits as well as the seniors will be prepared for the practice\r\nrange, during the months of February and March, by aiming at the butt\r\nand firing at the candle.\r\n\r\n  The Officers, especially the juniors, will be encouraged to exercise\r\nthemselves in gymnastics, and to frequent the School of Topography.\r\n\r\n  The Captains will be taught riding as much as possible where they are\r\nin garrison with Cavalry.\r\n\r\n  In the months of February and March the Officers will be further\r\nprepared in the appropriate theory, with a view to the instruction of\r\nthe following months, and all without exception will have to practice\r\nfiring with the rifle.\r\n\r\n  _April and May._\r\n\r\n  There will be no further distinction made between the recruits and\r\nseniors.\r\n\r\n  They will pass successively through soldiers’, squad, and company\r\ndrill, bayonet exercise, and rifle practice at the butt.\r\n\r\n  The school of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and gymnastics, will\r\nbe continued at least for the lower classes.\r\n\r\n  The Captains will give instruction to their companies, especially in\r\nbad weather, on the subject of packing necessaries, and on the general\r\nbehavior of the soldier under different circumstances on and off duty,\r\nshowing them also the manner of making reports in a few clear and\r\nconcise words.\r\n\r\n  The Officers will be prepared by the appropriate theoretical training\r\nfor the instruction of the following months.\r\n\r\n  The School of Topography will be continued as much as possible for the\r\nOfficers who desire to attend it.\r\n\r\n  _June, July, August._\r\n\r\n  They will pass successively through battalion drill and regimental and\r\nbrigade manœuvres.\r\n\r\n  The rifle practice at the butt will be continued.\r\n\r\n  The _Chasseur_ exercise will be taught.\r\n\r\n  The swimming school will proceed with the utmost possible activity.\r\n\r\n  The school of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and gymnastics will be\r\ncontinued at least for the lowest classes, as much at least as the\r\ninstructions in other subjects, and especially swimming, permit.\r\n\r\n  The Generals of Brigade will explain theoretically to the superior\r\nOfficers and Captains, and these latter to their own companies, the\r\nnature of service in the field.\r\n\r\n  _September._\r\n\r\n  By frequent marches instruction will be given in field service,\r\npractical in its nature, and separate for every arm.\r\n\r\n  Manœuvres and evolutions appropriate to the ground will be gone\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n  The troops will be disposed for the defense of a village or a\r\nposition, of a stream, or the like.\r\n\r\n  _October._\r\n\r\n  The instruction in the field will continue as much as possible, and\r\nespecially in the garrisons where troops of different arms are\r\nquartered, one part of the force can be opposed to the other, and, where\r\nthe service of the place permits it, by calling in the assistance of the\r\nNational Guard, the garrison will be able entirely or in part to absent\r\nitself for two or three days.\r\n\r\n  GENERAL RULES RELATING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS.\r\n\r\n  1. As far as is possible the soldiers should receive at least two\r\nlessons in the day.\r\n\r\n  2. In the months of April, May, June, July, and August, the drill in\r\nthe _place d’ armes_ will take place only once a day, the other will be\r\nin the barrack or the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n  3. The Officers should give the instructions themselves, and should\r\nnever appear as idle spectators before the soldier.\r\n\r\n  The subalterns will themselves conduct the soldiers’ and squad drill,\r\nand the bayonet exercise.\r\n\r\n  The Captains will be careful to instruct their own companies. At the\r\nrifle practice all the Officers of the Company should be present and\r\ninterest themselves for the good working of so important a subject of\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\n  4. During recreation times, and in all those kinds of instruction\r\nwhich do not require silence and immobility, the Officers will be\r\ncareful to converse with their inferiors, and to study their character\r\nand qualities, praising and encouraging the good to do well, and\r\nvisiting with words of blame more or less severe those who are\r\nill-regulated in their conduct.\r\n\r\n  5. In order to interrupt as little as possible the course of the\r\ninstructions, the Colonels and Generals of Brigade will avail themselves\r\nof the festivals accurately to review the men before and after mass.\r\n\r\n  6. In forts the Infantry will be exercised at the service of guns\r\naccording to the directions which will be given to the Officers of\r\nArtillery commanding in them.\r\n\r\n  7. Some Non-commissioned Officers in every regiment will be trained as\r\nthe carpenters for making cartridges.\r\n\r\n  8. In the interior of the barracks the men will be encouraged to amuse\r\nthemselves, and be gay, rather than to loiter about in idleness. It will\r\nbe most advantageous to introduce singing to music, as was done in the\r\ncamp of 1846.\r\n\r\n  9. In the month of August, Staff Officers will be dispatched to the\r\nprincipal garrisons who, being attached to Generals of Brigade and\r\nDivision, will prepare with them the projects and plans for the field\r\ninstructions of the months of September and October. These Staff\r\nOfficers are further particularly charged to study the environs, and to\r\npoint out in reports for that purpose the most important military\r\npositions, and the mode of occupying them.\r\n\r\n  10. Appropriate instructions concerning the rules to be observed in\r\nthe rifle schools, concerning the swimming school, and the exercises in\r\nthe field, will be forwarded at the proper time.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.

MILITARY SYSTEM AND EDUCATION IN RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor is commander-in-chief of all the forces, by sea and land,\r\nassisted by the Staff-Office, the members of which are expert linguists,\r\nas well as scientific experienced and military officers. The army is\r\nunder a Minister of War, assisted by a colleague and a military council.\r\nThe office of Master of Ordnance is generally filled by a grand prince.\r\nThe regular force, or army of occupation consists of about 783,000 men,\r\nwhich can be easily swelled to at least 1,200,000, as the whole male\r\npopulation are liable to serve when summoned. The army is mainly\r\nrecruited by conscription, which falls on the serfs and laboring\r\npopulation, as the nobility, officials, clergy and merchants are\r\nexempted. The term of service is twenty years for the guards, twenty-two\r\nfor the line, and twenty-five for the train and military servants. But\r\nfew pensions are granted to discharged or furloughed soldiers, although\r\nveteran soldiers are frequently appointed to situations as doorkeepers,\r\nwatchmen, overseers, &c., in government establishments and public\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nPromotion by seniority, imperial favor, and good conduct on the field.\r\nEvery officer must be educated and trained to his business, and serve\r\nfrom the lowest to the highest rank. Non-commissioned officers,\r\nmusicians, assistant veterinary surgeons, head workmen in the military\r\nworkshops and factories must all be trained for their special duties.\r\nA large portion of these classes are the sons of soldiers, who have been\r\nsurrendered by their parents to the government, who receive them at the\r\nage of six or twelve, by special arrangement. They are termed\r\n_cantonists_. Among the special military schools of a technological\r\ncharacter are, eleven for garrison artillery; three for armories; three\r\nfor powder mills; three for arsenals; one for riding masters; one for\r\nfencing; one for accountants; one for topographical drawing, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MILITARY SCHOOL FOR OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Russian army obtain their first commission after\r\npassing through the Military Schools or Cadet Corps, or if qualified in\r\nscientific and other instruction, ascertained by open examination, by\r\nserving as privates six months, and as sergeants or ensign two years.\r\nApplicants for the Staff Corps, must have served as officers two years,\r\nmust be recommended by their superior, and have been two years in the\r\nStaff School--and there pass an honorable examination in military\r\nhistory and strategy. The following statistics are taken from the\r\n_Kalender_ of the St. Petersburg Academy, for 1859.\r\n\r\nI. Under a Commission or Board of Military Instruction, which reports\r\ndirectly to the Emperor, there are\r\n\r\n   3 Military Schools of Special Application, viz.:\r\n     1 The Nicholas Academy of the Staff, with 22    and 250\r\n                                               teachers  scholars.\r\n     1 The Nicholas Upper Engineer School,  “  50  “     126 “\r\n     1 The Michael Artillery School,        “  32  “     117 “\r\n   1 Page Corps, or College                 “  41  “     159 “\r\n   1 Ensign’s School of the Guards,         “  31  “     206 “\r\n  22 Cadet Corps or Military Colleges,      “ 723  “    7440 “\r\n  --                                          ---      -----\r\n  27                                          899  “   8,298 “\r\n\r\nThe Cadet Corps, or Military Schools, receive their pupils young, and\r\nimpart a general as well as a scientific education, preparatory to\r\nentering the Special Schools of Application either for Engineer, or\r\nArtillery, and later in years and experience, the Staff School. These\r\nSpecial Military Schools are not surpassed by any of the same class in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nII. Under the Ministry of War there are the following Scientific\r\nEstablishments and Schools.\r\n\r\n  22 Military Schools, with                326   and 10,000\r\n                                           teachers  scholars.\r\n   3 Lower or Element.

PETERSBURG.\r\n\r\n[Extracts from Governmental Regulations.]\r\n\r\nI. GENERAL DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\nA Military Academy, the highest institution of its class, is founded in\r\nSt. Petersburg, to educate Officers for the service of the General\r\nStaff, and to promote the diffusion of Military Science in general. Its\r\nspecial functions are--\r\n\r\n1. To prepare Officers for the special service of the General Staff.\r\n\r\n2. To furnish to a certain number of Officers from the Artillery and\r\nChief Engineer School a course of Grand Tactics and Strategy, on the\r\nsame principles and to the same extent as it is furnished to the\r\nOfficers preparing for the Service of the General Staff.\r\n\r\n3. To apply all the means indicated in these Regulations to the\r\ndiffusion of Military Science.\r\n\r\nFrom forty to fifty Officers shall be educated in the Academy for the\r\nspecial service of the General Staff, and about ten from the Artillery\r\nand from the Chief Engineer School.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy is under the immediate control of the Chief of the\r\nStaff of His Imperial Majesty, and is under the direction of a President\r\nappointed by the Emperor.\r\n\r\nA Council, presided over by the President, considers and determines all\r\nimportant questions relating to Studies and Economic Administration.\r\n\r\nA Vice-President, appointed by the Emperor, is associated with the\r\nPresident to assist him in the performance of his official duties.\r\n\r\nThe Officers receiving an education for the General Staff are placed\r\nunder the control of four Staff Officers appointed by the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of Study and the Scientific Course are divided into two\r\nSections, the Theoretical and the Practical.\r\n\r\nThe number of Professors, Adjuncts, and Teachers is determined according\r\nto circumstances by the Academic Council, with the approbation of the\r\nChief of the Staff of his Imperial Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe Salaries of the Officials for the internal service of the Academy\r\nare fixed in the List annexed to these Statutes.\r\n\r\nIt is the most sacred duty of the whole Staff of the Academy, and in\r\nparticular of the Chiefs and Professors, never to lose sight of its\r\nobject; and while they devote themselves to extend the knowledge of the\r\nstudent Officers, to impress upon them, by teaching and example, the\r\nprecepts of the purest morality, the true and exact performance of their\r\nprofessional duties, an unconditional obedience to their superiors, and\r\nan inviolable devotion to the throne and their country.\r\n\r\nThe Academy has a peculiar Seal.\r\n\r\nII. ADMISSION TO STUDENTS.\r\n\r\nOnly Superior Officers can enter into the Academy, and these up to the\r\nrank of Staff Captain if they serve in the Guards, Artillery, or\r\nEngineers; up to the rank of Captain, if they belong to an Army\r\nRegiment.\r\n\r\nThe Directors of the Noble Guard School, of the Page Corps, of the\r\nFirst, Second, Pant, Moscow, and Finland Cadet Corps, have the right to\r\npropose in the proper quarter, for admission into the Academy, the most\r\ndistinguished Officers who have left these military institutions.\r\n\r\nThe Officers proposed for admission into the Academy must be at least\r\neighteen years old, and be distinguished for capacity, industry,\r\ndiligence, morals, and good conduct.\r\n\r\nOfficers from the Regiments and Artillery Brigades must present\r\ntestimonials of blameless morals, conduct, and zeal for the Service from\r\nthe Chief of their Division. Officers from the Engineer Battalions must\r\npresent similar testimonials from the Chiefs of their Brigades.\r\n\r\nThose who give testimonials are strictly responsible for their truth, as\r\nare the Chiefs of the Military Schools for the capacity and\r\nqualifications of the Officers they propose.\r\n\r\nAdmission into the Academy depends upon a strict examination in the\r\nfollowing subjects:--\r\n\r\n  _a._ Languages:\r\n\r\n  Russian, German, or French.\r\n\r\n  _b._ Mathematics:\r\n\r\n  Arithmetic, Algebra to Equations of the Second Degree, Plane and Solid\r\nGeometry, and Plane Trigonometry.\r\n\r\n  _c._ Military Sciences:\r\n\r\n  The Principles of Intrenchment, Fortification, and Artillery.\r\n\r\n  _d._ Evolution:\r\n\r\n  Evolutions of a Battalion of Tirailleurs, of a Squadron, of a Whole\r\nLine, of a Scattered Front (_Zerstreuten Fronte_,) and, lastly, the\r\nService of Outposts.\r\n\r\n  _e._ History:\r\n\r\n  General History of the World to the sixteenth century in its chief\r\nepochs, particularly in reference to Russia; special Histories of the\r\nEuropean States in modern times.\r\n\r\n  _f._ Geography:\r\n\r\n  Universal Geography, and particularly that of the Russian Empire and\r\nthe neighboring States.\r\n\r\n  Besides this, a clear conception of Situation, Plans, and\r\nTopographical Charts is required.\r\n\r\nIII. METHOD OF INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe Scientific Course is divided into two Sections,--The Theoretical and\r\nthe Practical. The Theoretical part of the higher Military Sciences is\r\nexpounded by the Professors, their Adjuncts, and the Teachers. Those\r\nOfficers who belong to the Practical Section exercise themselves under\r\nthe guidance of the Professors.\r\n\r\n  _a._ In Written Exercises on any proposed Military Subject.\r\n\r\n  _b._ In the composition of Military Descriptions (_Beschreibungen_,)\r\nof every kind.\r\n\r\n  _c._ In the Art of taking Military Surveys of a Country, and of\r\njudging the Tactical Nature of a Ground.\r\n\r\nIn each Section there are from twenty to twenty-five Officers destined\r\nfor the Service of the General Staff, and from four to five from the\r\nArtillery and Chief Engineer School.\r\n\r\nThese Officers, according to their capacities and attainments in the\r\nMilitary Sciences, enter either into the Theoretical Section or into\r\nboth the Theoretical and the Practical Section at the same time, and\r\nremain in each a year.\r\n\r\nThe complete Academic Course in both Sections extends over two years.\r\n\r\nThe following subjects are taught:--\r\n\r\n  _a._ Russian literature, with particular reference to the composition\r\nof Military Essays in a faultless style, and to the style of the\r\nMilitary Chancery (writing department of the War Office.)\r\n\r\n  _b._ General ideas on Artillery, and more precise details on the same\r\nsubject as a Special Arm; its use in the open field and in sieges.\r\n\r\n  _c._ Petty Tactics in the employment of a single Division, with which\r\nall Officers must be thoroughly familiar, as this is indispensable to\r\nall. To this is joined the theory of the formation of columns, of their\r\nuse, of the effect of the fire of Infantry, and lastly, the explanation\r\nof all evolutions with the three arms which are usually employed for\r\nmovement, deployment, or forming in order of battle.\r\n\r\n  _d._ The Elements of Topography and Geodesy, of Military Drawing, and\r\nthe art of measuring situations by the eye.\r\n\r\n  _e._ Military coup d’œil (_Scharfblick_,) and the art of judging the\r\ntactical nature of ground.\r\n\r\n  _f._ Castrametation, or the art of encamping, and the theory of\r\npositions.\r\n\r\n  _g._ Logistic, or all that relates to the details of marches, either\r\nin presence of the enemy, or in the movement of troops from one place to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n  _h._ Intrenchment and fortification, as far as regards the attack and\r\ndefense of intrenched camps and fortified places, and the effect of\r\nintrenchments and fortifications on the operations of an active army.\r\n\r\n  _i._ Grand Tactics, embracing the various systems of the Order of\r\nBattle; and the formation and employment of the Three Arms, and treating\r\nof unexpected engagements or the sudden collision of two hostile\r\nDivisions.\r\n\r\n  _k._ The Military Geography of Europe, particularly that of the\r\nRussian Empire and the neighboring States.\r\n\r\n  _l._ Military Statistics, or knowledge of the land and sea Forces and\r\nwarlike means of all the European States.\r\n\r\n  _m._ Strategy in all its extent; with a criticism on the last wars,\r\nand an indication of the events which demonstrate the influence of this\r\nscience on the success of a campaign.\r\n\r\n  _n._ A general view of military history in its most remarkable\r\nperiods, from the earliest times to Peter the Great, and a more complete\r\nview of the Military History of modern times.\r\n\r\n  _o._ The literary History of the Military Sciences, with a criticism\r\non the best ancient and modern writers on the History of War; and a\r\nspecial reference of those who may contribute to the further education\r\nof the Officers after their departure from the Academy.\r\n\r\n  _p._ Duties of the General Staff Officer in times both of peace and\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n  _q._ The art of riding.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Practical Division are employed on the same\r\nSciences; not, however, during the hours of lecture, but by practicing\r\nunder the direction of the Professors, and according to the regulations\r\nof the Academic authorities.\r\n\r\nThe subjects they are employed upon are principally the following:--\r\n\r\n  _a._ Topographical and Tactical description of ground after\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\n  _b._ Military Geography and Statistics.\r\n\r\n  _c._ Logistic.\r\n\r\n  _d._ Grand Tactics.\r\n\r\n  _e._ Strategy.\r\n\r\n  _f._ Military History.\r\n\r\n  _g._ Literature of the Military Sciences.\r\n\r\n  _h._ Designing plans of battles and manœuvres, as exercises in\r\nTopography, Logistic, and Tactics.\r\n\r\n  _i._ Historic reports, and keeping the usual journal of the General\r\nStaff.\r\n\r\n  _j._ All that belong to the survey of a country, and the practical\r\nworking of the Artillery and Siege operations.\r\n\r\nTeachers are appointed for those officers who require to be perfected in\r\nthe French or German language.\r\n\r\nAll the sciences are taught in the Academy in the Russian language; and\r\nan exposition in French or German is only allowed when dictated by\r\ncircumstances, and then a special permission must be first obtained from\r\nthe Chief of the Staff of his Imperial Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe Officers of the Practical Section are also required to use their\r\nnative tongue in their written exercises, except in one or two composed\r\nin a foreign language by the direction of the authorities.\r\n\r\nIn summer, the Officers of the Theoretical Section repair to regiments\r\nto which they are directed to learn the camp service. The Officers of\r\nthe Practical Section make surveys and reconnaissances, mark out camps\r\nand proportionate intrenchments on a given ground. At the time of grand\r\nmanœuvres, they are associated with Officers of the General Staff, and\r\nhave the opportunity of witnessing the practical exercises of the\r\nArtillery and Sappers, in order to be able to make a report as\r\neye-witnesses on the effect of Artillery and Siege operations.\r\n\r\nIV. LOCAL REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nAll Officers receiving an education in the Academy are entered on the\r\nrolls of their Regiments, Artillery Brigades, and Sapper Battalions, as\r\nsupernumeraries and detached Officers, without, however, losing their\r\nstanding or right of promotion by seniority, their pay, servants’\r\nrations, or any other advantages enjoyed by Officers present with their\r\ntroop.\r\n\r\nThose Officers who enter the Academy from the Regiments of the Garrison\r\nof St. Petersburg continue, while they belong to it, to perform the\r\nfront service of their Regiments; those who come from the Artillery and\r\nSapper Brigades, or from Regiments not stationed in St. Petersburg, are\r\nattached for the front service to one of the Regiments of the Garrison\r\nof St. Petersburg; the necessary arrangements are made by the\r\nauthorities of the Guard Corps.\r\n\r\nThe Officers of the Artillery and Chief Engineer School, having only to\r\nattend the Course of Grand Tactics and Strategy, retain their posts\r\nwhile studying in the Academy.\r\n\r\nFour Staff Officers, appointed by the Emperor, have the immediate\r\ncontrol of the Officers preparing themselves for the service of the\r\nGeneral Staff; they are to exercise a vigilant supervision over them,\r\nand to report on their conduct to the Vice-President; they are the organ\r\nby which all orders reach the Officers, and they form a Court of the\r\nFirst Instance in matters relating to the Service.\r\n\r\nOne day in the week is devoted to drill, and every day two officers\r\nmount guard with the first division of the garrison of St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe Officers are to devote exclusively to study the leisure hours at\r\ntheir command after the performance of front and garrison duties; and\r\nare to observe, in all respects, the Statutes of the Academy.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate, economically, the residence of the Officers in St.\r\nPetersburg, they receive, with the exception of those belonging to the\r\nGuard, besides their usual pay and an allowance for quarters according\r\nto their rank, an annual allowance of 500 roubles, which is paid in the\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nOfficers ordered to survey a country, or to make a reconnaissance,\r\nreceive their traveling expenses from the Commissariat, according to the\r\ndistance to which they are sent, and in proportion to their rank: their\r\nboard expenses are not allowed.\r\n\r\nV. REGULATIONS RESPECTING PROMOTION.\r\n\r\nThe course is terminated, and Students finish their career, in October\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Officers are removed from the Theoretical section to\r\nthe Practical, making place for candidates who wish to enter the former.\r\n\r\nAt their departure from the Academy the Officers receive from the\r\nAcademic Council testimonials of conduct and scientific attainments,\r\nwith a memorial of the rewards which they receive at leaving.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the Academy the Officers have to act as follows: those who\r\nbelonged to the Artillery, or Chief Engineer School, repair to their\r\nhighest Commanding Officer; the rest, who were educated for the service\r\nof the General Staff, return to their Regiments, Artillery Brigades, or\r\nSapper Battalions, on whose rolls they remain as supernumeraries and\r\nOfficers reckoned as of the General Staff, until they are formally\r\ntransferred to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe rewards to which Officers can acquire a claim at leaving the Academy\r\nare the following:--The most distinguished is promoted to the lowest\r\nrank (on the Staff,) and receives a golden medal; he is only entitled to\r\nthis if all the teachers give him the full number balls, and unanimously\r\nrecognize him as most conspicuous for attainments. Besides this, he must\r\nhave written a satisfactory essay on a given theme, relating to some\r\nimportant war, and have been blameless in moral conduct during his\r\nresidence in the Academy. The student who is recognized as second, both\r\nin attainments and behavior, and has also obtained the full number of\r\nballs, is rewarded with the great silver medal, and receives double pay\r\nfor a year. The student who obtains the third place in attainments and\r\nbehavior, and the full number of balls, receives the little silver\r\nmedal, and double pay for a year. Each medal bears the name of its\r\npossessor. Besides this, the names of all those who obtain one of the\r\nthree above-mentioned rewards are engraved on marble tablets, which\r\nadorn the walls of one of the halls of the Academic building.\r\n\r\nShould any of the Students feel no inclination for the service of the\r\nGeneral Staff, even after a successful termination of the Theoretical\r\nCourse, he may always request to be dismissed to his Regiment, Artillery\r\nBrigade, or Sapper Battalion.\r\n\r\nEvery Officer who at his departure from the Academy obtains a\r\ntestimonial of having accomplished the object of his admission, and in\r\nconsequence is provisionally destined for the service of the General\r\nStaff, if he continues after his return to his Regiment to educate\r\nhimself for his vocation, and distinguishes himself by observance of a\r\nstrict discipline, by conduct and zeal for the service, is rewarded at\r\nthe end of a year by being completely transferred to the General Staff;\r\nand if he belonged to the Young Guard, the Artillery, or a Sapper\r\nBattalion, his right to promotion immediately commences; not so if he\r\nbelonged to Troops of the Line.\r\n\r\nEvery year, on the 1st of January, the Chief of the Regiment, Artillery\r\nBrigade, or Sapper Battalion in command of an Officer reckoned as of the\r\nGeneral Staff, forwards his form and his conduct list to the\r\nQuartermaster-General of the General Staff, who lays it before the Chief\r\nof the General Staff. At the same time the above-mentioned papers are\r\ncommunicated to the Chief in command of the Officer.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the above-mentioned Chief makes a similar report on the\r\nzeal for the service and moral conduct of the Officers twice a year,\r\nnamely, on the 1st of March and the 1st of September; and at the same\r\ntime reports exactly on the way in which he performs the service of the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nNo Officer reckoned as of the General Staff is to be charged with the\r\nduties of Paymaster service in his Regiment, or employed as\r\nQuartermaster; and if any General wishes to select him for his Adjutant,\r\nhe must first communicate with the Quartermaster-General of the General\r\nStaff.\r\n\r\nIf the General Staff is increased in time of war, or if any work on\r\nwhich it is employed requires to be accelerated in time of peace, the\r\nChief of the General Staff commissions the Quartermaster-General to\r\nselect the requisite number out of the Officers who are reckoned as of\r\nthe General Staff. The latter then makes the selection, and announces\r\nthe names of the Officers selected to their highest Commanding Officer.\r\nAs soon as the object proposed is accomplished, these Officers return\r\nback to their commands. Such a selection, however, can only fall upon\r\nthose who have spent at least two years with their commands after their\r\ndeparture from the Academy. If in the meantime an Officer has become\r\nChief of a Battalion or Squadron, he shall not be transferred from this\r\npost before the lapse of a year. As soon as any of these Officers, or,\r\nin general, any Officer, who has left the Academy, reports himself at\r\nhis Corps, his Chief immediately announces his arrival to the\r\nQuartermaster-General of the Staff.\r\n\r\nTo familiarize the Officers reckoned of the General Staff with the rules\r\nof the Art of War while they remain with their commands, and to practice\r\nthem in the duties which belong to Officers of the General Staff, the\r\nQuartermaster-General is directed to charge them with such duties as may\r\ndevelop their talent, without, however, removing them for that purpose\r\nfrom the service of the front. These commissions of the\r\nQuartermaster-General are communicated through their superior Officers,\r\nwho are directed not only to watch over their performance of these\r\ncommissions, but also to assist them therein to the utmost of their\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Errata for Part VI (Russia):\r\n  twenty years for the guards, twenty-two for the line,\r\n    _hyphen invisible_\r\n  [II.

MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish army is composed, according to official data in Martin’s\r\nYear Book, of five distinct classes of troops, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. The _Indelta_, or national militia, paid and kept, not by the\r\nGovernment, but by the landowners, and, to some extent, from the income\r\nof State domains expressly reserved for this purpose. Every soldier of\r\nthe _Indelta_ has, besides a small annual pay, his _torp_, or cottage,\r\nwith a piece of ground attached, which remains his own during the whole\r\nperiod of service, often extending over forty years, or even longer. In\r\ntime of peace, the troops of the _Indelta_ are not called up for more\r\nthan a month’s annual practice, and for the rest of the year are free\r\nfrom military duty. In time of war, an extraordinary _Indelta_ has to be\r\nraised by landowners, who, on this account, enjoy certain privileges,\r\nincluding non-contribution to the cost of the peace establishment. When\r\nthe soldier dies, his widow turns over the holding to his successor,\r\nwhom the owner of the land is bound to provide within three months. In\r\nthe location of the officers, regard is had to the situation of the men\r\nwho compose the company, regiment, and larger divisions.\r\n\r\n2. The _Beväring_, or conscription troops, drawn by annual levy, from\r\nthe male population between the age of 20 and 25 years. The law of\r\nconscription, which admits the right of purchasing substitutes, was\r\nintroduced into Sweden in 1812. About 19,000 men are drafted annually,\r\none-tenth of which number, on the average, find substitutes for\r\nthemselves, at a cost of from 10_l._ to 25_l._\r\n\r\n3. The _Värfvade_, or enlisted troops, to which belong the royal\r\nlife-guards, the hussars, the engineers, and the artillery. The men may\r\nengage for either three, or six, or twelve years; but the greater number\r\nare for six years, peculiar inducements being held out for this term.\r\n\r\n4. The volunteers, first organized in the year 1861, by the spontaneous\r\ndesire of the population of the kingdom. In time of peace the volunteers\r\nare individually free, and bound by no other but their own rules and\r\nregulations: but in time of war they may be compelled to place\r\nthemselves under the command of the military authorities.\r\n\r\n5. The militia of Gothland, consisting of twenty-one companies of\r\ninfantry, organized in a similar manner to the _Indelta_, yet quite\r\nindependent of the latter. They are not compelled by law to serve beyond\r\nthe confines of the Isle of Gothland, and have a separate command from\r\nthe other troops.\r\n\r\nThe armed forces of Sweden, not counting the Volunteers, consist\r\naltogether of--\r\n\r\n  _Indelta_,              33,405  rank and file.\r\n  _Beväring_,             95,295    “        “\r\n  _Värfvade_,              7,692    “        “\r\n  Militia of Gothland,     7,921    “        “\r\n                         -------\r\n      Total,             144,313\r\n\r\nIn the organization of the army, as here enumerated, 85,000 men belong\r\nto the infantry of the line; 6,000 to the cavalry; 5,000 to the\r\nartillery, and the rest to the irregular militia. The number of\r\nvolunteers was returned at 40,848 in 1869, but about one-third of these\r\nformed part also of the _Indelta_. In the parliamentary session of 1862,\r\nand again in the sessions of 1865 and 1869, the Government brought bills\r\nbefore the Diet for a reorganization of the whole of the army, on the\r\nbasis of extending the conscription, reforming the _Indelta_, and doing\r\naway, to a great extent, with the _Värfvade_. But neither of these\r\npropositions was adopted by the representatives of the people, whose\r\nhabits are not easily set aside.\r\n\r\n_Navy._\r\n\r\nThe Navy of Sweden was reorganized in 1866-67, being divided into two\r\ndistinct parts; the first to serve as an ordinary fleet of war for\r\naggressive as well as defensive purposes, and the second stationary, and\r\nsolely devoted to coast defense. It consisted in 1869 of--\r\n\r\n    6 Iron-clads, of 638 horse-power, and             10 guns.\r\n   21 Unarmored steamers, of 2,810 horse-power and   127   “\r\n   16 Sailing vessels, with                          376   “\r\n  158 Gunboats and floating batteries,               551   “\r\n                                                   -----\r\n  Total, 201 vessels, of 3,458 horse-power         1,064 guns.\r\n\r\nThe iron-clads are built after the American model; one a turret ship,\r\ncalled the “John Ericsson,” is partly covered with steel armor. There\r\nwere 6,453 sailors and marines in active service, and 28,000 men were on\r\nfurlough or attached to the fleet of reserve and coast defense.\r\n\r\nThe expenditure for the army in 1869 was 9,528,600 _riks dalers_, and\r\nfor the navy 3,963,800. The indebtedness of the state is about\r\n$41,000,000, mostly contracted in aid of a system of railways.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY SYSTEM AND EDUCATION IN NORWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe armed forces of Norway, as organized by law in 1866, consisted in\r\n1869 of the following:\r\n\r\n1. The regular army, with reserve, raised partly by conscription and\r\npartly by enlistment, which must never exceed 12,000 men in time of\r\npeace, and can not be increased above 18,000 men without the special\r\nconsent of the Storthing. The average number in time of peace for ten\r\nyears past, is about 6,000. The term of service is seven years, but the\r\nmen are on duty only 42 days in the first year, and this past, they are\r\nsent home on furloughs, with an obligation to meet for annual practice\r\nof 24 days during the following six years.\r\n\r\n2. The Militia or _Landvaern_, which consists of all able-bodied male\r\ncitizens 18 years of age, who for three years must, at stated periods,\r\nbe trained in the use of arms and field exercises, and at the end of\r\nthis time, be enrolled in\r\n\r\n3. The final Levy, or _Landstorm_, where he is liable to be called out\r\nin time of war, until he is 45 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe normal strength of the armed forces of Norway in 1869 was returned\r\nat 47,714 on a peace footing, and 112,225 on a war footing, and required\r\nan appropriation of 1,215,500 _specie dalers_, making the cost of the\r\nNorwegian soldier (on the average of 6,000 men under arms), $155 per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nThe King has permission to keep a guard of Norwegian volunteers, and to\r\ntransfer, for the purposes of common military exercises, 3,000 men\r\nannually to Sweden; otherwise a soldier of Norway can not set foot in\r\nSweden; or one of Sweden, in Norway.\r\n\r\nThe naval force consists of 20 vessels, of 2,280 horse-power, and 168\r\nguns, manned by 2,248 sailors, who are volunteers out of 60,000 men in\r\nthe maritime conscription, which includes all seafaring men of the\r\nseaports, between the ages of 22 and 35.\r\n\r\nThree of the vessels are iron-clad monitors.\r\n\r\nIn order to utilize the vessels of the navy they are attached to the\r\npostal service, and are employed in carrying the mails and passengers,\r\nunder a special minister, charged with the mail service. The navy and\r\npost service cost in 1869, 1,172,815 _speciedalers_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY SYSTEM AND EDUCATION IN DENMARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe armed forces of Denmark as organized in 1870, consists of--\r\n\r\n1. The Regular or active army, and--2. The army of Reserve.\r\n\r\nBy the law of 1867, every male citizen who has completed the age of 21,\r\nis liable to service for eight years in the former, and to be enrolled\r\nready for special call for eight years more in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom is divided into five territorial brigades, and each brigade\r\nin four territorial battalions, in such way that no town except the\r\ncapital, will belong to more than one battalion. Each territorial\r\nbrigade furnishes the contingent of a brigade of infantry and one\r\nregiment of cavalry. The artillery contingent is furnished, one half by\r\nthe two first territorial brigades, and the second half by the three\r\nother divisions. The forces therefrom comprise 20 battalions of infantry\r\nof the line, with 10 depot battalions and 10 of reserve; 5 regiments of\r\ncavalry, each with 2 squadrons active, and 2 depots; and 2 regiments of\r\nartillery, in 12 battalions. The total strength of the army, exclusive\r\nof the reserve, is 36,782 rank and file, with 1,068 officers, on the\r\npeace footing, and 47,725 men, and 1,328 officers on the war footing.\r\nAbout one half of the enrolled regular army are usually on furlough. The\r\ndrilling is divided into two periods; the first lasts six months for the\r\ninfantry; five months for the field artillery and the engineers; nine\r\nmonths and two weeks for the cavalry; and four months for the siege\r\nartillery and the technic corps. Each corps must drill each year during\r\nthirty to forty days.\r\n\r\nThe navy comprises the following vessels, all steamers:\r\n\r\nSix _iron-clads_, with an aggregate of 2,455 horse-power, and with 65\r\nguns--two of which are turreted, armed each with two of Armstrong rifled\r\ncannon; 12 _unarmored vessels_ of 1,820 horse-power, and with 192 guns;\r\n7 gun-boats of 480 horse-power and 38 guns; 6 paddle-steamers, of 1,060\r\nhorse-power and 38 guns. The navy in 1869 was manned by 901 men, and\r\nofficered by 15 commanders, 34 captains, and 67 lieutenants.\r\n\r\nThe budget for 1869 provided 3,783,978 _rigsdalers_ for the army, and\r\n1,676,681 for the navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Erratum for Part VII:\r\n  PART VII. /  NORWAY, SWEDEN AND DENMARK.\r\n    _heading supplied from Table of Contents_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPART VIII.\r\n\r\nMILITARY SYSTEM AND SCHOOLS IN GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. MILITARY SYSTEM AND EDUCATION IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe British army originated in the feudal system, by which the great\r\nbarons were bound to furnish a contingent to the army of the State; and\r\ntheir vassals were bound to attend them in person, and to furnish each\r\nthe contributions in men, horses, arms, and other materials of war, for\r\nwhich he was liable by the tenure on which he held his lands. When regal\r\npower absorbed the privileges of the great feudatories, the people were\r\nexpected to provide themselves with arms, and, in case of invasion, to\r\nrespond to the summons issued through officers commissioned by the\r\nsovereign to array the fittest men for service in each county. In the\r\ntime of Henry VIII, lord-lieutenants and deputy-lieutenants of counties\r\nwere first appointed as standing officers for assembling and mustering\r\nthe military forces. For a time, contracts were made with “captains,”\r\nwho undertook to provide, clothe, and feed a certain number of fighting\r\nmen for a given money allowance. In the reign of Charles I, the\r\nimportant question arose, whether the King of England did or did not\r\npossess the right to maintain a military force without the express\r\nconsent of Parliament. Charles II, was compelled to abandon all control\r\nof the army, except a body guard of 5,000 men, sanctioned by Parliament.\r\nThese regiments still exist, and are proud of their genealogy. They are\r\nthe First Foot Guards, Coldstream Guards, Life Guard, Oxford Blues, the\r\nRoyal Scots, and the Second Queen’s Royals.[1] The Declaration of\r\nRights, in the time of William and Mary, settled in positive terms “that\r\nthe raising and keeping of a standing army in time of peace, without\r\nconsent of Parliament, is contrary to law.” The first Mustering Act was\r\npassed in 1689, to last for six months; but it has been annually renewed\r\never since, except in three particular years; and it constitutes the\r\nonly warrant on which the whole military system of England is exercised\r\nby the sovereign with the consent of Parliament. For 172 years, with\r\nonly three interruptions, the ministers of the crown have annually\r\napplied to Parliament for permission to raise a military force and for\r\nmoney to defray expenses. The sovereign can make war and bestow military\r\nemployment and honors; but the House of Commons can refuse supplies.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Two regiments created in the reigns of Richard III,\r\n    and of Henry VIII, the first styled _Gentlemen Pensioners_, or\r\n    _Gentlemen at Arms_, consisting originally exclusively of\r\n    noblemen, and the latter, _Yeomen of the Guard_, still exist. The\r\n    latter is the only body that has the privilege of traversing\r\n    London with flags flying, drums beating, and fixed bayonets.]\r\n\r\nMilitary service in England is voluntary, except in rare cases, and then\r\nonly in the militia. As the chances of promotion from the ranks are\r\nsmall, the recruits are drawn from the most necessitous classes of the\r\ncommunity, or the least fitted for industrial pursuits. The system of\r\nrecruiting, with the bounty and machinery of deception is the most\r\ncharacteristic feature of the British army as compared with those of\r\nEurope, and makes the distinction between officers and men more broad\r\nthan in any other service.\r\n\r\nThe British army, in its completeness, is theoretically commanded by the\r\nsovereign, assisted by the secretary of state for war in some matters,\r\nand by the commander-in-chief in others. The component parts are the\r\nhousehold troops, the infantry of the line, the ordnance corps,\r\ncomprising artillery and engineers, and the marines. There are also\r\ncertain corps, raised and belonging to the principal colonies; the\r\ntroops in India; the yeomanry cavalry; the dockyard battalions; the\r\nvolunteer artillery and rifles; the enrolled pensioners, etc. In 1814,\r\nthe regular army reached 200,000, and at the close of the war, 10,000\r\nofficers were retained on half pay. In 1860-61, in the army estimates,\r\nprovision was made for the following force, viz.:\r\n\r\n              Home and Colonies.      India.

Of the total 235,852 forces, 10,459\r\nare officers, 17,670 non-commissioned officers, and 207,723 rank and\r\nfile. For the use of this army, 24,342 horses are provided. The total\r\nexpenditure sanctioned by Parliament in 1860 was £14,800,000, viz.:\r\n\r\n  Military Pay and Allowances, £5,500,000;\r\n  Civil Salaries and Wages, £1,800,000;\r\n  Stores and Works of every kind, £5,400,000;\r\n  Pensions, Retired Pay, &c., £2,100,000.\r\n\r\nThe military force of various kinds within the United Kingdom, excluding\r\nthe troops in East India, on the 1st of June, 1860, was 323,259, viz.:\r\n\r\n  Regulars (service companies,) 68,778;\r\n  Regulars (depot companies,) 33,302,\r\n  Embodied Militia, 15,911;\r\n  Disembodied Militia--Effectives, 52,899;\r\n  Yeomanry Cavalry--Effectives, 15,002;\r\n  Enrolled Pensioners--Effectives, 15,000;\r\n  Volunteer Rifles and Artillery, 122,867.\r\n\r\nThe total force of the United Kingdom in 1870-71, was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                                 Total.\r\n  Officers on the General and Departmental Staff,                1,239\r\n\r\n    Regiments.

The First Lord Commissioner is\r\na member of the Cabinet, and dispenser of patronage, and, with his\r\nassociates, goes out with the Premier.\r\n\r\nThe effective strength of the Navy in February 1, 1869, was:\r\n\r\n  [KEY]\r\n  Sg _Sailing._\r\n  T  _Total._\r\n\r\n  _Classes of Ships._                     _Steam._          _Sg_   _T_\r\n                                      Afloat.

The total number of officers, seamen, boys\r\nand marines, in 1870-71, was 55,430, besides 4,300 in the coast-guard\r\nand 1,270 in the Indian service. Among the officers were 143 flag\r\nofficers; 29 superintending dockyards, and 3,193 other commissioned\r\nofficers on service.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. MERCANTILE MARINE.\r\n\r\nThe Mercantile Marine of the United Kingdom in number of vessels, their\r\nregistered tonnage, and men employed, together with the value of\r\nproperty and number of passengers transported in them, exceeds that of\r\nany other country. The total number of vessels in the home and foreign\r\ntrade, registered in 1869, was 21,881, with a tonnage of 5,575,303,\r\nemploying 202,477 men, and freighted with imports and exports to the\r\ntotal value of 532,475,266_l._\r\n\r\nAll matters relating to merchant ships and seamen, and the mercantile\r\nmarine generally, are committed to the general superintendence of the\r\nBoard of Trade, which, as constituted in 1786, is composed of certain\r\nhigh officers, (members of the Privy Council), and its President is a\r\nCabinet officer. To this Board all consular officers, all officers of\r\ncustoms abroad, and all local marine boards and shipping masters must\r\nmake reports in matter and form as required. Inspectors, duly appointed\r\nby this Board, may visit any ship, examine any registry, machinery,\r\nboats, equipments, &c., to ascertain if they are conformable to law. In\r\nevery seaport a Shipping Master is appointed by the Local Marine Board,\r\nwho must keep register of names and character of seamen, facilitate\r\ntheir engagement and discharge, as well as the apprenticeship of boys to\r\nsea-service. The Local Board must provide for the examination of persons\r\nwho intend to become masters or mates according to rules laid down by\r\nthe Board of Trade. And to such as pass a satisfactory examination as to\r\nsobriety, experience, ability, and general good conduct on board ship,\r\nshall be given a certificate of competency; and to those who have served\r\nas masters or mates, under certain conditions, a certificate of service\r\nwith specifications must be given. Shipping Masters must assist, when\r\napplied to by parents or guardians, or masters of ships, in apprenticing\r\nboys to the sea-service. No person can be employed as master or mate,\r\nwho does not hold a certificate of competency, and under certain\r\nconditions, of service. Opportunities of preparing for these\r\nexaminations are now provided in all the large seaports, in Navigation\r\nSchools; and the Government, through the Department of Science and Arts,\r\nencourages the study of astronomy, navigation, steam and steam\r\nmachinery, and other branches, which are serviceable to officers in\r\ncommand of vessels, whether propelled by sails or engines, by making\r\nappropriations of money to schools according to the number of pupils who\r\npass satisfactory examinations in these studies.\r\n\r\nMILITARY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the institutions for military education in\r\nEngland is abridged from an article in _Blackwood’s Magazine_ for\r\nNovember, 1858:\r\n\r\n  There exist in this country three military seminaries--the Royal\r\nMilitary Academy at Woolwich, where youths are educated for service in\r\nthe Artillery and Engineers; the Royal Military College at Sandhurst,\r\nwhere cadets are prepared for the Infantry and Cavalry; and the\r\nHonorable East India Company’s Military School at Addiscombe, which\r\neducates simultaneously for the Artillery, Engineers, and Infantry\r\nservices of the three Presidencies. Supplementary to these are the\r\nSchool of Practical Instruction at Chatham, where passed cadets from\r\nWoolwich and Addiscombe learn practical engineering; and the senior\r\ndepartment at Sandhurst, supposed to be a Staff school, into which\r\nofficers of infantry and cavalry are, under certain restrictions,\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\n  I. The Military Academy at Woolwich came into existence in the year\r\n1741. It was created by George II., to supply a want under which the\r\nEnglish army then suffered, by giving some instructions in matters\r\nconnected with their respective arts to officers and men who served in\r\nthe Artillery and in the Engineers. Its beginnings were of the humblest\r\nimaginable order. A single room in a house at Woolwich, where the Board\r\nof Ordnance used occasionally to assemble, was set apart by Government\r\nas a hall of study; and two masters were appointed to give lectures by\r\nrotation, during four consecutive hours, in three days of every week. At\r\nfirst only the officers of the single battalion composing the English\r\nArtillery and of the corps of Engineers were required to attend. By and\r\nby the room was thrown open to the non-commissioned officers and\r\nprivates also, and eventually the cadets, of whom five were supposed to\r\nbe on the strength of each company of Artillery, repaired thither in\r\nlike manner. But the cadets being the sons of the officers of the corps,\r\nas they neither dressed in uniform, nor were under any military control,\r\nproved very difficult to manage; and the difficulty led to a great\r\nchange as well in their condition as in that of the Academy itself.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1744 the cadets were, for the first time, clothed in\r\nuniform, and collected into a distinct company. Two officers, with a\r\ndrum-major, undertook the management of them; and the arrangement\r\nworked, or was supposed to work, so satisfactorily, that by little and\r\nlittle, as the regiment enlarged itself, the numbers composing the Cadet\r\nCompany were increased also. In 1782 they had grown from twenty to\r\nsixty; in 1798 to a hundred; after which steps were taken to lodge and\r\nboard, as well as to educate and drill them, apart from the residences\r\nof their fathers. Hence, after trying for a while to accommodate some in\r\na separate barrack, while others were billeted on private persons at a\r\npayment of 2s. a day per head, the pile which now attracts the attention\r\nof the passer-by on Woolwich Common was erected. And by the addition of\r\na lieutenant-governor, and a whole host of officers and professors, it\r\ngrew into the sort of establishment which is familiar to most of us. In\r\n1806 the staff of officers and teachers appointed to the Cadet Company\r\nconsisted of--\r\n\r\n    1. Lieutenant-Governor; 2. Inspector; 3. Professor of Mathematics;\r\n4. Professor of Fortification; 5. Mathematical Master; 6. Arithmetical\r\ndo.; 7. French do.; 8. Fortification do.; 9. Landscape-drawing do.;\r\n10. Figure-drawing do.; 11. Second French do.; 12. Fencing do.;\r\n13. Dancing do.; 14. First Modeller; 15. Second do.: 16. Clerk.\r\n\r\n  In 1829 the fencing and dancing masters were discontinued, and a\r\nchemical lecturer appointed. In 1836 three new masters were added; and\r\nin 1857 the staff stood thus:\r\n\r\n    _Military._--A Governor; one Second Captain, commanding; one do. for\r\nPractical Class; four First-Lieutenants; one Quartermaster; one\r\nStaff-Sergeant; seven Drill-Sergeants; one Paymaster’s Clerk; one\r\nAssistant do.; Servants.\r\n\r\n    _Civil or Educational._--A Chaplain; Inspector--a Lieut.-Colonel\r\nof Artillery; Assistant do.--Major, R.E.; Professor of\r\nFortification--Lieut.-Col., R.E.; two Assistants--Second Captains;\r\nProfessor of Mathematics; seven Mathematical Masters; Master of\r\nDescriptive Geometry; Master for Geometrical Drawing; Drawing-Master for\r\nLandscape; Second do.; Master for Military Plan-Drawing--Brevet-Major,\r\nR.A.; Instructor in Surveying and Field Works--Captain, R.E.; Assistant\r\ndo.--Captain, R.A.; Instructor in Practical Artillery--Second Captain,\r\nR.A.; Assistant do.--Second Captain, R.A.; four French Masters; four\r\nGerman do.; Master for History and Geography; Lecturer in Chemistry;\r\nAssistant to do.; Lecturer in Geology and Mineralogy; Lecturer in\r\nPractical Mechanics, Machinery, and Metallurgy; Lecturer in Astronomy\r\nand Natural Philosophy; Clerk; First Assistant do.--a Sergeant; Second\r\ndo.--Bombardier; one Drill-Sergeant--Practical Class; Modeller,\r\nModelling Smith, Servants, &c.\r\n\r\n  Admittance to the Academy was, till very lately, obtained only on the\r\nnomination of the Master-General of the Ordnance. There was a\r\npreliminary examination, it is true; but this all except the dullest\r\nmight calculate on passing, and the ages of entrance ranged between\r\nfourteen and sixteen. In 1835 the minimum age was raised to fifteen, the\r\nmaximum to seventeen; while candidates were called up to compete for\r\nadmission in the proportion of four youths for every three vacancies.\r\nThe arrangement did not avail to produce any radical change in the\r\nspirit of the institution. The preliminary examination still proved to\r\nbe a “pass,” and no more; and so it continued till those political views\r\nobtained the ascendant which abolished altogether the office of\r\nMaster-General and Board of Ordnance, and gave us in their place a\r\nSecretary of State for the War Department.\r\n\r\n  Occasions had arisen, even under the old regime, when young men were\r\npermitted to enter the service of the Artillery under what may be called\r\nexceptional conditions. During the pressure of the great war of the\r\nFrench Revolution, the demand for officers became at one time so urgent,\r\nthat it was found necessary to dispense with a regular academical\r\neducation, and to give commissions to candidates who were pronounced by\r\ncompetent examiners sufficiently conversant with mathematics and\r\nphysical science to enter upon the practical duties of their profession.\r\nLord Panmure, taking advantage of the precedent thus furnished, threw\r\nopen Artillery commissions in 1855, and has continued ever since to\r\ntreat admission into the Royal Military Academy as a prize for which the\r\nyouth of the United Kingdom may freely compete.\r\n\r\n  The subjects of study to be pursued in the Royal Military Academy at\r\nWoolwich, not less than the mode of dealing with them, and the\r\ntext-books to be used, have hitherto been prescribed to the most minute\r\nparticular by regulation. They embrace Mathematics, Fortification,\r\nDescriptive Geometry, French, German, Plan-Drawing, Geometrical Drawing,\r\nLandscape Drawing, History and Geography; to which, during his\r\ncontinuance in what are called the “theoretical classes,” the attention\r\nof the cadet is confined. When he enters the “practical class,” the\r\nstudent is instructed, over and above, in Practical Artillery, Surveying\r\nand Field-Works, and attends lectures in Astronomy, Chemistry, Geology,\r\nand Mineralogy. As many as five years may be spent by a young man in\r\ngoing over this course--viz., four years in the “theoretical,” and one\r\nyear in the “practical” class--though the average period of actual\r\nresidence does not appear to exceed two years and a half or three years.\r\nThere are periodical examinations at the end of every half-year, the\r\nsecond of which, by its results, determines whether the young man shall\r\nbe allowed to go on to a commission, or be removed from the Academy.\r\n\r\n  The moral tone of this military college has never, we regret to say,\r\nbeen of a very high order. Excellent men have been at the head of it,\r\nand the ability of the professors and teachers appointed to instruct\r\nadmits of no question. Yet few right-minded officers look back upon the\r\nyears spent in the cadet barracks except with disgust. It is not very\r\ndifficult to account for the circumstance. Long after Continental\r\nnations had seen the absurdity of pressing upon boys the sort of\r\ntraining which belongs to men, we refused to be guided by their\r\nexperience, and persisted, both at Woolwich and elsewhere, in our\r\nendeavor to accomplish an impossibility. “Boys of fourteen, fifteen, and\r\nsixteen,” says a very high authority on this subject, “require much\r\npersonal supervision in order to form their characters, which young\r\nofficers, very often appointed without any sufficient knowledge of their\r\ntempers and habits, cannot be expected to bestow. Such officers may\r\nindeed be able to superintend drill, but not moral training. Rarely do\r\nthey draw the cadets towards them, and become their advisers; more\r\nfrequently repel them by a harsh dictatorial manner, the cadet being in\r\ntheir eyes a soldier. There has been also, during all the time I have\r\nknown the Academy, great inconsistency in treating the cadets. Honor is\r\nconstantly talked of, and yet doubts as to their truthfulness are not\r\nunfrequently expressed. I have heard even the lie given in rough and\r\nemphatic terms. Confidence is professedly placed, and yet offences are\r\nfound out in a way that shows that no confidence existed. Hence a\r\ncontest arises between the officer and cadet, and the latter becomes\r\ntricky and disingenuous.”\r\n\r\n  In these emphatic words Colonel Portlock has struck at the root of\r\nmost of the evil which has long been felt, and heretofore combated\r\nwithout success, in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich. Whatever is\r\nwanting in the morale of that establishment, it owes to the original sin\r\nof its constitution. We know how to deal with boys so long as we\r\nrecognize their boyhood, even while appealing to the point of honor\r\namong them. But we no sooner dress them up in uniform, and affect to\r\ntreat them as soldiers, than we lose all moral control over them. They\r\nsmoke, drink, swear, and fall into other vices, not because they are\r\novercome by any irresistible temptation, but because they look upon such\r\nacts as tokens of manhood. And the corporals, who report readily enough\r\nfor insubordination, and the officers, who punish for what they call\r\nmilitary offences, take little heed of worse things; partly because, in\r\na military point of view, they are scarcely criminal; partly because,\r\nnot being regarded as such, they are seldom brought under the notice of\r\nthe superior authorities. How a seminary so conducted and so managed\r\nshould have given to the Artillery and Engineers a body of officers\r\ndistinguished, as those of both arms unquestionably are for talent,\r\nintelligence, and gentlemanly bearing, would be inexplicable, were not\r\nthe fact well known, that one of the first lessons taught to the young\r\nlieutenant, after quitting the Academy, is to throw off the habits which\r\nhe had contracted there, and to adopt the high moral tone and excellent\r\nhabits of his regiment.\r\n\r\n  It was partly with a view to provide a palliative for this admitted\r\nevil, partly to encourage in our young Artillery officers the habit of\r\nsustained study, that they were required, by a recent regulation, “to\r\nplace themselves under the orders of a director of studies for half a\r\nyear after obtaining their commissions. Meanwhile cadets who are\r\nappointed to the Engineers proceed to the training-school for that arm\r\nat Chatham; where they go through a somewhat careful course of\r\nsurveying, and are instructed less elaborately in architecture, civil as\r\nwell as military, and in mining, sapping, pontooning, and so forth.\r\nAccording to the report of the Commissioners, it does not appear that\r\nthey reach their new field of instruction over and above well prepared\r\nto make the most of it. Indeed, the whole of the Woolwich system is by\r\nthese gentlemen condemned in terms as decided as is consistent with good\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\n  II. It was not till the year 1804 that the propriety of training young\r\nmen in ever so slight a degree for the service of the infantry and\r\ncavalry, seems to have occurred to any statesman or soldier in this\r\ncountry. Appointments to both arms took place for a time by purchase\r\nonly, and by and by, when the numbers of the rank and file increased,\r\nthrough the weight of influence, personal, political, or social.\r\nMoreover, when the pressure of the great war was at its height, a third\r\ndoor of entrance to military rank was opened, and ensigncies and\r\ncaptaincies, and even lieutenant-colonelcies, became the prize of\r\nprivate gentlemen who were able to bring certain fixed contingents of\r\nable-bodied men under the royal standard. So far as the candidates for\r\ncommissions themselves were concerned, however, the same even-handed\r\njustice was meted out to all. Nobody took the trouble to inquire whether\r\nthe candidates were qualified morally, intellectually, or physically. He\r\nmight be a pimp and blockhead, or lame, or deaf, or blind; but so long\r\nas his patron had the ear of the Government, or the men whom he brought\r\nwith him were able to pass muster, his commission, whatever it might be,\r\nwas secure.\r\n\r\n  The Military College at Sandhurst consisted at first, as it still\r\nconsists, of two departments--one, called the Junior Department, for\r\ncadets--the other, the Senior Department, for officers desirous of\r\nqualifying for the Staff. But it had, in its original constitution, this\r\nmarked advantage over the arrangement which has since been effected,\r\nthat whereas now cadets and officers occupy portions of the same range\r\nof buildings, and come under the instruction of the same professors,\r\nthey were, in 1804 placed, the one at Marlow, the other at\r\nHighwickam--each class of students having its own teachers, though both\r\nwere subject to the control and management of the same military\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n  As first constituted, the junior department afforded both an asylum\r\nand a place of education for the sons of officers exclusively. Youths\r\nonce admitted ceased to be a burden to their friends, except for the\r\nnecessary expenses of travelling; they were housed, clothed, and\r\neducated at the public expense. But no sooner was the great war ended\r\nthan Parliament began to slacken in its gratitude to the army, and by\r\nlittle and little the grants for military education fell off, till in\r\nthe end they ceased altogether. As a necessary consequence, the numbers\r\nof persons seeking education at the Military College fell off in like\r\nmanner. And now the junior department exhibits a muster-roll of 180\r\ncadets only, while the strength of the senior department has dwindled to\r\nnine individuals. To be sure, other causes than the withdrawal of public\r\nsupport from the institution have operated to produce this latter\r\nresult. Whatever it might have been forty years ago, the senior\r\ndepartment at Sandhurst is certainly no Staff school now. Indeed, the\r\nonly science effectively taught there seems to be mathematics; and it is\r\na curious fact, that though the army abounds with officers who have\r\npassed through that school, and taken high honors, the instances are\r\nrare in which Staff appointments have fallen to the lot of any of them.\r\n\r\n  Lads are admitted into the junior department at Sandhurst between the\r\nages of thirteen and fifteen. The preliminary examination is of the most\r\ntrivial kind, and the instruction communicated is, for half the course,\r\nthat of a common school not of the highest order. No doubt each youth\r\nmay, if he be disposed, master more than the elements of a good deal of\r\nscience; for over and above physical geography and history, instruction\r\nis given in practical astronomy, dynamics, and statics, practical\r\nmechanics, co-ordinate geometry, the differential and integral calculus,\r\ntrigonometry and mensuration, Euclid’s Geometry, attack and defence of\r\nfortresses, practical field-fortification, course of military surveying,\r\nthe Latin, French, and German languages. Unfortunately, however, there\r\nis no compulsion to study, nor any inducement, unless the youth aspire\r\nto win for himself a commission without purchase.\r\n\r\n  III. The Hon. East India Company’s College at Addiscombe approaches\r\nnearer in its constitution and objects to what a military school ought\r\nto be, than any other of which we can boast in this country. It came\r\ninto existence in 1818, previously to which date the Directors were in\r\nthe habit of sending to Woolwich, for instruction, youths to whom they\r\nhad given cadetships in the Company’s Artillery and Engineers. When\r\nfirst founded, it was intended as a place of training exclusively for\r\nthese young gentlemen; but the benefits derived from it became so\r\nobvious and so great that the Court of Directors gradually enlarged its\r\nviews, and now young men are educated at Addiscombe not only for the\r\nCompany’s Artillery and Engineers, but for their infantry also. And\r\nherein it is that the Directors have mixed up evil with good. They\r\nconsider an Engineer cadetship as their great prize, and next to that a\r\ncadetship of Artillery; and they select for these appointments, not the\r\nyouths who may have exhibited special talents for either arm, but the\r\nbest men, or the men reported as generally best, of their batch. The\r\nconsequence is, that to the infantry--for good service in which talent\r\nis as much required as for either the Artillery or Engineers--the idlers\r\nof the College are appointed, while many a clever lad, who would have\r\nshone as an infantry officer, becomes an indifferent engineer or gunner,\r\nsimply because he has been posted to an arm for the practical operation\r\nof which he has no genius.\r\n\r\n  In all other respects the Military School at Addiscombe may be fairly\r\nsaid to surpass both Woolwich and Sandhurst. In the first place, youths\r\nenter there almost invariably at a more mature age. Though eligible for\r\nadmission after completing their fifteenth year, they seldom, if ever,\r\ncome up for examination till after they have turned seventeen. In the\r\nnext place, the entrance examination is more severe than either at\r\nWoolwich or Sandhurst; and in the third and last place--and this is the\r\nmost important condition of the whole--cadets must complete their course\r\nat Addiscombe in two years, unless for special reasons, such as\r\nsickness, they be allowed to prolong their stay one half-year more. Now,\r\nlads may linger on at Woolwich four, and even five years, gaining this\r\nremarkable advantage from their stupidity, that when forced to compete\r\nat last for choice between Artillery and Engineers, they compete with\r\nyouths who may have had but two years’ training. And at Sandhurst, the\r\ncourse which nominally covers four years, may, if the youth have\r\ninterest at headquarters, be completed, as far as his appointment to a\r\ncommission completes it, in four months.\r\n\r\n  The general education given at Addiscombe is certainly not inferior to\r\nthat which the cadets receive either at Woolwich or at Sandhurst. It\r\nembraces, indeed, almost entirely the same subjects which are set down\r\nin the curriculum of the others--including lectures in geology,\r\nchemistry, and artillery. But it undeniably falls short in specialties.\r\nHence, after completing his course at Addiscombe, the Company’s cadet\r\nintended for the Engineers proceeds to Chatham, where, side by side with\r\nyoung men from Woolwich, he receives practical instruction in his art.\r\nFor the Artillery cadet, on the other hand, there is no practical\r\nschool. Like his comrade intended for the service of the Infantry, he\r\nproceeds at once from Addiscombe to India, and learns there how to turn\r\nto account the theoretical lessons which have been communicated to him\r\nat home.\r\n\r\n  Another distinction deserves to be noted between the constitution of\r\nthe school of Addiscombe, and that as well of the Royal Military College\r\nas of the Royal Military Academy: Though all alike put from them the\r\neleemosynary element, at Addiscombe alone is strict impartiality in the\r\nmatter of payments observed. The youth who enters there, whether he be\r\nthe son of an earl or of a subaltern’s widow, must be provided with his\r\n£100 a year, besides about £25 more to cover the cost of books,\r\ninstruments, and uniforms. Both at Woolwich and Sandhurst there is a\r\ngraduated scale, which exacts more from a general officer than from a\r\nsubaltern, and more from a civilian than from either. The orphan of an\r\nofficer dying in poor circumstances is admitted into Woolwich on payment\r\nof £20 a year. He pays for similar privileges at Sandhurst £40. The son\r\nof a gentleman in civil life pays in both cases £125, a sum more than\r\nnecessary to cover the expenses of his own board and education, but\r\nwhich is exacted in order that there may be a surplus out of which the\r\ndeficiencies occasioned by the payments of the sons of officers shall be\r\nmade good.\r\n\r\nMost important changes in the system of Military Education in England\r\nhave been introduced since 1855, by Lord Panmure and the Council of\r\nMilitary Education, inaugurated under his auspices.\r\n\r\n1. Admission to the various Military Schools is now gained by open\r\ncompetitive examination.\r\n\r\n2. The order and method of studies, and all examinations for promotion,\r\nare governed by an independent Board of competent officers, and men of\r\nservice, called the Council of Military Education.\r\n\r\n3. The amount and order of studies in each school are minutely arranged,\r\nand each Professor is kept to the prescribed course by the supervision\r\nof a Master of Studies.\r\n\r\n4. The development of the Staff School has given completeness to the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIII. FRENCH VIEW OF ENGLISH MILITARY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nM. Alphonse Esquiros, in the _Révue des Deux Mondes_ of September 1860,\r\ncontributes two articles on the military schools and institutions of\r\nEngland, from which we make a few extracts:\r\n\r\n  THE MILITARY SPIRIT AND PREPARATION OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n  On what foundation is the assertion based that England is only a\r\nfirst-class naval power? Although never numerous, have not the English\r\nsoldiers sufficed for all the great eventualities of history? Has not\r\nthe weight of their arms been felt for centuries past in the balance in\r\nwhich are weighed the destinies of the Continent? Each time that it was\r\nnecessary to conquer, have they not conquered? I will not awaken\r\nirritating recollections. I will not mention the name of a great battle\r\nso painful to our national self-love; it will suffice to recall the\r\nfact, that recently, England, with a handful of men, has reconquered\r\nIndia. Instead of denying history, it were better to ask by what links\r\nthe British character is connected with the group of martial nations.\r\nThe Englishman is not warlike from inclination; he does not love war for\r\nwar’s sake, or maintain an army for the ruinous pleasure of seeing\r\nbayonets glitter and banners flaunt. He has an army to defend his\r\nterritory, his commerce, the immense net-work of his external relations\r\nand possessions. Experience has more than once shown him the necessity\r\nof placing the pride of riches under the protection of courage. The\r\nEnglishman has less enthusiasm than coolness. Immovable when attacked,\r\nhe feels that the responsibility of the labor which has made England an\r\nopulent nation rests upon his arms. The military element, therefore,\r\npresents in Great Britain peculiar and interesting features. And then,\r\nquite recently, besides the regular army, a new independent army has\r\narisen. Yesterday, it existed but as a project; to-day, it fills the\r\ntowns with the blast of its clarions, passes review in Hyde Park and\r\nHolyrood, and covers the plains with the smoke of its skirmishers.\r\nI speak of the volunteers, or riflemen. We must investigate the origin\r\nof this movement, and the influence it has already exercised on English\r\nhabits; but before busying ourselves with the army and volunteers, it\r\nwill be well to study the military schools and arsenals.\r\n\r\n  REFORMS IN MILITARY EDUCATION AND PROMOTION IN 1856.\r\n\r\n  The delay and disasters of the operations before Sebastopol aroused\r\nthe attention of the press and the people to the manner in which\r\nofficers for the army were trained, appointed, and promoted. The\r\nGovernment was aroused by the emotions of the country, and in 1856, a\r\ncommission was appointed by Lord Panmure, Secretary of War, to\r\nreorganize the education of the officers. That commission visited the\r\ndifferent military schools of Great Britain, visited similar\r\ninstitutions in France, Prussia, Austria, and Sardinia, and collected\r\nall documents of a nature to enlighten it researches. Its report is a\r\nmonument of science, and art, and impartiality. The authors of that\r\ninvestigation, Col. Yolland, Col. Mythe, and Mr. Lake, of the Oxford\r\nUniversity, pointed out what reform ought to be made in the English\r\nsystem to raise the establishment of military education to the level of\r\nthe inevitable progress claimed by the present age. They recommended a\r\nCouncil of Military Education, which, placed beyond and above the\r\neducating body, should direct the studies of the young men destined for\r\nthe army. From these various influences--the pressure of public opinion,\r\nthe commission appointed in 1856 by the Government, and especially the\r\nCouncil of Military Education, arose those happy changes, which we shall\r\nendeavor to point out in the military institutions of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n  ROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY AT WOOLWICH.\r\n\r\n  Before 1855, the candidates were named by the master-general of\r\nordnance; and although there was an entrance examination, the\r\nrequisitions were very elementary, and no youth, influentially connected\r\nor recommended, was rejected. The results, although the institution\r\nfurnished some good engineers and artillery officers to the English\r\narmy, were not satisfactory. Since 1855 the system of appointment and\r\ninstruction has been re-organized. Appointment on nomination has given\r\nplace to open competition. A ministerial circular made an appeal to all\r\ncandidates desirous of entering the academy without distinction of\r\nclass, or party. Public examinations thrown open to the youth of\r\nEngland, with independent examinations, succeeded the private\r\nexaminations within the college walls. The axe was laid at the tree of\r\nprivilege, and personal merit was substituted in its place.\r\n\r\n  The entrance examinations take place twice, a year, at Chelsea\r\nHospital--the home of disabled soldiers, and the school of orphan\r\nsoldiers’ children--in a large hall hung with the captured trophies and\r\nbattle flags of different nations. The programme embraces mathematics,\r\nsimple and practical; history, geography, and English literature; the\r\nGreek and Latin classics; the French language and literature; German,\r\nchemistry, and physics; mineralogy and geology; geometrical and\r\nlandscape drawing. To each subject a certain numerical value is\r\nassigned. Each candidate is limited to five subjects, including\r\nmathematics, which he may select out of the programme, and on his\r\nobtaining an aggregate as well as relative number of marks depends his\r\nsuccess. The results are made public, and the unsuccessful candidates\r\nare allowed another trial to fill succeeding vacancies. Then\r\nexaminations exercise an indirect but elevating influence upon the\r\nschools of the country which send forth the candidates. Competition has\r\nput a check upon ignorance and mediocrity, no matter how well backed by\r\nsocial and political influence.\r\n\r\n  Another reform, not less important than that of competition, or the\r\nsystem of nominations, was that order of the minister of war,\r\nlengthening the age for the admission of candidates. That age was fixed\r\nbetween 16 and 20. The inconvenience of submitting young men too soon to\r\nmilitary discipline has been recognized with great wisdom by Gen.\r\nPortlock.[2] “The character of adolescents exacts,” he says, “a more\r\ndelicate cultivation than that which must be expected from officers\r\nimbued with the command of a military school. In their eyes, no matter\r\nhow young he is, the pupil is a soldier, and they treat him almost as\r\none. Doubtless they excel in drilling him well; but do they possess the\r\nnecessary qualities and experience for forming the morals of youth?”\r\nAnother consequence of the early admissions was the introduction of a\r\nsort of confusion and uncertainty in the system of teaching. Now, a\r\ndistinct line is drawn between the course of studies which precede and\r\nwhich follow admission to the academy. The conclusion was come to that a\r\nmilitary academy formed a sort of line of demarcation in life between a\r\ngood general education which ends, and a professional service which\r\ncommences. The character, mind, manners of the candidate are supposed to\r\nbe formed according to the usages of the world; he has reached that age\r\nwhen a man knows himself, and looks out for a career.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: The Inspector of Studies at the Academy, now member\r\n    of the Military Board of Education.]\r\n\r\n  It is needless to dwell on the course of instruction, which is now\r\nnearly the same in all the great military schools of Europe. There are\r\nthirty-five professors, many of them eminent in their respective\r\ndepartments. One leading object, both of instruction and discipline, is\r\nto cultivate the habit of self-improvement and self-government. Physical\r\nsports are practiced and encouraged, and the cadets frequently challenge\r\nthe officers of the garrison to a match of cricket.\r\n\r\n  An examination takes place every six months, in which the progress of\r\neach cadet is ascertained and reported. Those who pass through the\r\nseries in good standing are promoted to a commission; the most\r\ndistinguished to the engineer corps, and the others to the artillery.\r\nThe appointment of these young officers gives rise to an interesting\r\nceremony. The Duke of Cambridge, with a numerous staff, visits Woolwich\r\nAcademy twice a year. All the cadets are present in review in front of\r\nthe monument. It is pleasing to see how admirably they go through the\r\nmanœuvres. The duke then enters a hall where a _viva voce_ examination\r\ntakes place on the art of fortification. This over, the cadets form in\r\nsquare, and the duke then advances to the table where the prizes are\r\nlaid out. These prizes consist of a sword of honor, telescopes,\r\nmathematical instruments, and books. The President of the Council of\r\nEducation reads out the names of the cadets of the first class who are\r\nto receive commissions in the engineers and artillery. In conclusion,\r\nthe Duke of Cambridge addresses some parental words to the young men who\r\nare about to leave the academy to enter the army. Such is a brief\r\naccount of this academical festival, to which the brilliancy of the\r\nuniforms, the rank and names of the assistants, the happy emotions on\r\nthe faces of the young men, impress a character of charm and solemnity.\r\n\r\n  MILITARY COLLEGE AT ADDISCOMBE.\r\n\r\n  Addiscombe was formerly the residence of the Earl of Liverpool, but\r\nwas converted into a school at an expense of $40,000, by the East India\r\nCompany. Within a few years it has passed into the hands of the\r\nGovernment. One of the first acts of the Secretary of War and Council of\r\nMilitary Education was to inaugurate a system of admission (which was\r\nopen by patronage of members of the company) by competitive examination,\r\nand which has been attended with the happiest results. After passing a\r\nyear at Addiscombe, the cadets enter according to merit (ascertained by\r\nexamination) and either enter the engineers, artillery, or line service.\r\nThe India service will always remain distinct and sought after; that\r\nlife of adventures, encampments in the jungles, tiger hunts, the\r\nattraction of struggles against man and nature, the dazzling figures of\r\na world shining in the east through the fogs of Great Britain, all this\r\nresponds to one feature of the English character, the love of adventure.\r\n\r\n  ROYAL COLLEGE OF SANDHURST.\r\n\r\n  Here are two distinct institutions--the college, which is a\r\npreparatory school for infantry and cavalry officers, and the _senior\r\ndepartment_, or staff school. The scholars of the last department, who\r\nhave already gone through the competitive examination, are commissioned\r\nofficers; they have even served a certain number of years in the army;\r\nsome of them have gone through the Crimean war and the Indian campaign.\r\nIn 1859, one of these officers had received eighteen or nineteen wounds,\r\nwhich had deprived him of one of his eyes. I was surprised at finding\r\namong them candidates for staff appointments who could write and speak\r\nFrench in a manner that would have done honor to a French officer.\r\n\r\n  The English find it an advantage to admit young officers of talent and\r\nenergy into the higher branches of the service. To the experience of\r\ntheir profession, their picked soldiers add knowledge already acquired,\r\nwhich a second course of education develops and consolidates. It must,\r\nhowever, be admitted that it requires a certain moral strength to\r\nreturn, after having held a command, to the benches of a school, to\r\nfollow various studies, and to submit to strict examinations, which\r\nexclude all ideas of promotion and favor, fortune or birth.\r\n\r\n  In an economical point of view, these two institutions, Woolwich and\r\nSandhurst, cover their own expenses without any cost to the State. This\r\nfact, which was by no means foreseen, is owing to two measures\r\nrelatively of recent date--the gradual withdrawal of subsidies formerly\r\ngranted by Parliament, and the accession of the sons of rich men not\r\nbelonging to the army; these latter pay a high premium, and thus\r\ncontribute towards the education of the other cadets, who, being sons of\r\nofficers, enjoy certain immunities. In England, it is thought equitable\r\nthat the services of the father should be counted in favor of the son;\r\naccording to this principle, the debt contracted by the country towards\r\nmilitary men is paid to their sons by civilians.\r\n\r\n  Young men who have not passed through Sandhurst may, nevertheless, be\r\nadmitted as officers into the line or cavalry, but on the condition of\r\nundergoing an examination and _purchasing_ their commissions. This\r\npurchasing of direct commissions is doubtless detrimental to Sandhurst\r\nCollege. The abolition of the system has often been mooted. The Duke of\r\nCambridge approves of the abolition, as does the Minister of War, and\r\nwishes that no officer shall be admitted into the English army except\r\nfrom a military college.\r\n\r\n  COUNCIL OF MILITARY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n  So far we only behold the members of a great system. There is unity in\r\nthe Council of Military Education, which to a certain extent is the head\r\nof instruction. The influence of their council, which consists of\r\neminent men, is felt in the different schools, introduces changes and\r\nuseful reforms, directs the public examinations--in a word, gives the\r\nimpulse to the military studies of the United Kingdom. The civil and\r\nreligious element is represented therein by one of the most learned men\r\nof England (the Rev. Henry Mosley, canon.) The other members are\r\ngenerals and colonels belonging to different corps of the army.\r\n\r\n  Thus it will be seen that England enjoys a system of military\r\neducation which will bear comparison with that of any other nation in\r\nEurope. The chief purposes of this system are a good general instruction\r\nup to the age of sixteen or nineteen years, then a short military\r\ninstruction, then, after some years of service, a final course of\r\nstudies in the senior department or staff college. It must not, however,\r\nbe supposed that the present state of things, though happily modified by\r\nthe recent principle of competition, is the extreme limit of progress.\r\nIn the name of liberty, I am too anxious that Great Britain should\r\nmaintain her position in the world, to pay a full compliment to her\r\nself-esteem and enslumber her aspirations for reform. She has done much\r\nin these latter times; but there is still much to be done, and she is\r\naware of it, to raise the moral power of her officers to the level of\r\nmodern times, where enlightenment pervades every class of society.\r\n\r\nMODIFICATIONS IN 1871.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 a Royal Commission was appointed “to inquire into the Present\r\nstate of Military Education and into the Training of Candidates for\r\nCommissions in the Army.” The Report, with the minutes of evidence and\r\nillustrated documents, was quite voluminous, and has been followed with\r\nimportant changes in both the system of military instruction, and in the\r\nmode of making appointments and promotions in the army, that will be\r\nnoted in detail in the following chapters, which are compiled from\r\nhistorical notices by the Secretary of the Commission, and recent\r\nRegulations for the government of the several schools and the\r\nexaminations for appointment and promotions.\r\n\r\nThe most important measure affecting the British army; after repeated\r\ndiscussions of the principle, in the last and former Parliaments, and\r\nparticularly in the last, on a bill of the Gladstone ministry, in which\r\nthe votes of the Commons in favor was overruled by the Lords, was the\r\nabolition of the whole system of purchase and sale of commissions by\r\nRoyal Warrant issued July 20, 1871. This radical change was followed\r\n(October 30) by a revision of the Queen’s Regulations, in which original\r\nappointments and promotions in the military service are put on a new\r\nbasis. Henceforth, commissions of the first grade are to be issued to\r\nsub-lieutenants, for any vacancy occurring:\r\n\r\n1. To successful candidates, in the order of merit as ascertained by\r\ncompetitive examination in general subjects.\r\n\r\n2. To graduates of the universities who shall pass a qualifying\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n3. To Queen’s Cadets, Indian Cadets, and Pages of Honor, who have passed\r\nsuccessfully the final examination of the Military Academy, or its\r\nequivalent.\r\n\r\n4. To non-commissioned officers who are recommended for promotion by\r\ntheir commanding officers. If more candidates apply than there are\r\nvacancies to be filled, appointment is decided by competition.\r\n\r\n5. To a lieutenant of the militia, who shall pass the professional\r\nexamination required.\r\n\r\nSub-lieutenants are eligible to promotion only after passing a\r\nprofessional examination, and only after twelve months’ service with a\r\nregiment, under strict discipline, with liability to be removed for\r\nphysical or moral unfitness. Within three years from the date of their\r\ncommissions as lieutenants, officers may submit to an examination in\r\nrespect to fitness for promotion to captaincies, and any officer failing\r\nto pass within three years, must retire from the army. Lieutenants are\r\neligible to the rank of captain at any time after two years’ service in\r\nthe army, having passed the examination. A captain may be made a major\r\nafter two years’ service in the army; and a major is at any time\r\neligible to a lieutenant-coloneley, which means the command of a\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nEvery promotion must now be made on the recommendation of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, with the approval of the Secretary of State for War;\r\nand from the principles laid down in the Royal Warrant, as will be seen\r\nfurther on, every precaution is taken to insure a gradual advance by\r\nseniority, and a more rapid rise by meritorious service founded on\r\nintelligent and disinterested tests. By the new Warrant the Militia is\r\nbrought into closer connection with the Regular Army. To the abolition\r\nof purchase, and promotion by professional preparation and service, may\r\nbe added the autumn field manœuvres, inaugurated in 1871, with 30,000\r\nmen, and the localization of the Army, by assigning a corps with staff,\r\ntrain, men, &c., to territorial divisions of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL OF MILITARY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\nIn the debates which took place in Parliament during the Crimean war, in\r\nthe year 1855, attention was frequently drawn to the necessity of\r\nimproving the professional education of officers, and more particularly\r\nof providing means of instruction for, and requiring special\r\nqualifications from, those who were candidates for the staff. In the\r\ncourse of the same year a great alteration was made in the principles\r\nwhich had hitherto regulated preparatory instruction for the army, by\r\nabandoning, so far as the scientific corps were concerned, the system of\r\njuvenile military education, and throwing admission to the Artillery and\r\nEngineers open to public competition among candidates whose age would\r\nafford the presumption that their general education was already\r\ncompleted. At the beginning of 1856 three Commissioners, Lieut.-Colonel\r\nYolland, R.E., Lieut.-Colonel Smythe, R.A., and the Rev. W. C. Lake,\r\nwere appointed by Lord Panmure, then Secretary of State for War, “to\r\nconsider the best mode of reorganizing the system for training officers\r\nfor the scientific corps”; and for this purpose were directed to visit\r\nthe military schools of France, Prussia, Austria, and Sardinia. The\r\ninstructions issued to the Commissioners informed them that it was\r\nalready decided that admission to the scientific corps should be\r\nobtained by open competition, and that the age of candidates admitted to\r\nthe examination should be from 17 to 20.\r\n\r\nWhile the Commissioners were still engaged in their inquiries, the\r\nquestion of military education was frequently brought before the notice\r\nof Parliament in the course of the session of 1856, more particularly by\r\nMr. Sidney Herbert, who, in an elaborate speech on the 5th of June,\r\nexplained to the House of Commons the details of a general scheme of\r\neducation for officers of all branches of the service, the outline of\r\nwhich he had previously sketched out while Secretary at War in 1854, in\r\na letter to the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nThe subject of military education was one which at this time engaged the\r\nserious attention both of the Government and the public. Toward the\r\nclose of the year, Major-General Lefroy (then Colonel Lefroy, and\r\nemployed at the War Office as artillery adviser to the Secretary of\r\nState) was directed by Lord Panmure to draw up a general scheme for the\r\neducation of officers; and numerous plans, with a similar object, were\r\nabout the same period proposed for the consideration of the Secretary of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe military educational establishments which existed in 1856 were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  The Royal Military College at Sandhurst,   } Under the control of the\r\n  comprising a senior and junior department. }  Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n  The Royal Military Academy at Woolwich.    }\r\n  The Ordnance School at Carshalton, a       }\r\n   preparatory establishment to the Academy. } Under the control of the\r\n  The Department of Artillery Studies at     }  Clerk of the Ordnance.\r\n   Woolwich.                                 }\r\n  The Royal Engineer Establishment at        }\r\n   Chatham.                                  }\r\n\r\n  The East India Military College at         { Under the Court of\r\n   Addiscombe.                               {  Directors of the\r\n                                             {  East India Company.\r\n\r\n  The School of Musketry at Hythe.           { Under the control of the\r\n                                             {  Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n  The Royal Military Asylum at Chelsea,      }\r\n   comprising a training school for army     } Under the control of the\r\n   schoolmasters, and a model school for     }  Deputy Secretary of War.\r\n   children.                                 }\r\n  The Royal Hibernian School at Dublin.      }\r\n\r\n  Garrison and regimental schools for        } Under the control of the\r\n   soldiers and children.                    }  Chaplain-General.\r\n\r\nUp to this period no systematic organization for the direction of\r\nmilitary education had prevailed in this country; the various\r\neducational establishments were under the control of separate\r\ndepartments, and no single authority exercised any general supervision\r\nover them. The appointment of a Director-General of Military Education\r\nhad been already advocated in Parliament by Mr. Sidney Herbert, and the\r\ninstitution of a special department to superintend the whole system of\r\neducation for the army was one of the main features both of Colonel\r\nLefroy’s and of all the other schemes brought under the consideration of\r\nLord Panmure at this period.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners appointed in 1856, after having visited the military\r\nschools of the Continent, presented their Report in January, 1857. In\r\nthis Report, although their instructions had more particularly directed\r\ntheir attention to the training of officers for the scientific corps,\r\nthey touched upon several points connected with the education of\r\nofficers of the army generally. One of the changes most strongly\r\nrecommended by them was the formation of a special Board of Military\r\nEducation. “We consider it of the first importance,” their Report says,\r\n“that military education in this country should be regarded as a whole,\r\nand that perfect unity of system and harmony in its working should be\r\nmade to prevail. This, we conceive, can only be done by bringing\r\nmilitary education generally under the control of one head, the\r\nSecretary of State for War; and to effect this, a Board or Section of\r\nMilitary Education should be formed, as part of the establishment of the\r\nWar Office.” The Report adds: “The creation of such a Section appears to\r\nus far more important than any other single object we can recommend.”\r\nThe Commissioners also stated that after careful consideration, they\r\nrecommended the combined action of a Board in preference to the\r\nundivided authority of a single individual, on the ground of the variety\r\nof knowledge and experience required for the proper treatment of\r\neducational questions.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of the Council of Military Education was the first\r\nresult of the recommendations of the Commissioners. Its institution was\r\nproposed in a letter from the Commander-in-Chief to the Secretary of\r\nState for War on the 6th of April, 1857, and as originally constituted,\r\nit consisted of the Commander-in-Chief as _ex officio_ president, a\r\nMajor-General as vice-president, and two field officers as members. The\r\nappointment of the Council, although the members commenced their duties\r\nat once, was not officially gazetted until June.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the Council, however, did not in the first instance\r\nextend to a general superintendence over the whole system of military\r\neducation. Almost simultaneously with their institution an\r\nInspector-General of Army Schools was appointed under the Secretary of\r\nState for War, to whom the management of all institutions connected with\r\nthe education of soldiers and children, which had previously been in the\r\nhands of the Chaplain-General, was entrusted. Nor was the supervision of\r\nthe Council even over the education of officers at first general, as the\r\nRoyal Military Academy at Woolwich remained under the management of the\r\nWar Office (under which department it had been placed on the abolition\r\nof the office of Master-General of the Ordnance), and the examinations\r\nfor admission to it were conducted by a separate Board of Examiners,\r\nunder the superintendence of Canon Moseley.\r\n\r\nThe instructions issued to the Council on their first appointment\r\ndirected their attention more especially to the organization of a Staff\r\nCollege, the revision of the system of examinations for direct\r\nappointments to the army, the amalgamation of Woolwich and Sandhurst,\r\nand the professional instruction and examination of officers after\r\nentering the service. On all these questions they submitted reports in\r\nthe course of the year, and at the beginning of 1858 they commenced to\r\nconduct the examinations in connection with the Staff College and the\r\nCadet College at Sandhurst, although these establishments were not\r\nformally put under their authority until, by a Royal Warrant of the 1st\r\nof October, 1858, the Council were appointed Visitors of the Royal\r\nMilitary College. The examinations of officers for direct appointments\r\nto the staff, which had been instituted in 1857, were also placed under\r\nthe superintendence of the Council in 1858; but at a later period, the\r\nportion of these examinations which has more especial reference to\r\nmatters of drill and regimental duty was, on the recommendation of the\r\nCouncil themselves, removed from their control, with the view of its\r\nbeing conducted by a Board of Officers appointed by the\r\nAdjutant-General.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1858, the office of Secretary to the\r\nCouncil of Military Education was created, and in June of the same year\r\nan augmentation of their number took place by the addition of two new\r\nmembers,--one a field officer, the other a civilian, the Rev. Canon\r\nMoseley. The constitution of the Council as then fixed continues to the\r\npresent day, and consists of the Commander-in-Chief as _ex officio_\r\npresident, a vice-president, and four members, one being a civilian.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a civilian as a member of the central Board of\r\nMilitary Education had been recommended by the Commissioners of 1856, on\r\nthe ground of the close connection between military and civil\r\neducational questions. The decision to carry out this recommendation,\r\nsimultaneously with an augmentation in the strength of the Council,\r\nappears to have been connected with the determination arrived at, to\r\nplace the superintendence of the Academy at Woolwich--the competitive\r\nexaminations for admission to which had hitherto been conducted by Canon\r\nMoseley--in the hands of the Council. They were formally appointed\r\nVisitors of the Academy in August, 1858, their control over the\r\neducation of the officers of the army being now made almost entirely\r\ngeneral. The powers of the Council, however, in regard to Woolwich\r\nappear, probably from the fact of their not being defined by Royal\r\nWarrant, to be theoretically somewhat less extensive than those\r\npossessed by them over Sandhurst, as the recommendation of the\r\nappointment of professors, which in the case of the latter college is\r\nformally vested in the Council, is at the Academy left to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1859, the Indian Military College at Addiscombe was placed\r\nunder the supervision of the Council, and the examinations for admission\r\nto it were conducted by them until the close of the establishment in\r\n1861.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, the superintendence of army schools, garrison libraries,\r\nrecreation rooms, the Royal Military Asylum at Chelsea, and the Royal\r\nHibernian School at Dublin, were transferred from the Secretary of State\r\nfor War to the Council.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, the Advanced Class of Artillery Officers, on its institution,\r\nwas placed under the control of the Council. Since this date the whole\r\nsystem of army education has been superintended by that body, with the\r\nexception of the examinations of officers for promotion, the School of\r\nMusketry at Hythe, and the more peculiarly regimental institutions which\r\nexist in the Department of Artillery Studies, the School of Gunnery at\r\nShoeburyness, and the School of Military Engineering at Chatham, for the\r\nspecial instruction of officers of the scientific corps. The Survey\r\nClass at Aldershot, though not formally is indirectly subject to their\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\n1.

EXAMINATIONS FOR DIRECT COMMISSIONS.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the year 1849, no educational qualifications were required\r\nas a condition of obtaining a commission, except from officers appointed\r\nto the scientific corps--admission to which could only be obtained by\r\npassing through the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich--and from the\r\nsmall proportion of officers, scarcely amounting, at that time, to one\r\nsixth of the whole number annually obtaining commissions, who entered\r\nthe other branches of the service from the Royal Military College at\r\nSandhurst. Examinations for admission to the army generally were first\r\ninstituted by the Duke of Wellington, when Commander-in-Chief, in 1849.\r\nThe examination, in addition to general subjects of elementary\r\neducation, included the professional subject of fortification, in which\r\nthe candidate was required to have read some easy work on the subject,\r\nand to have received some instruction in drawing. This requirement was\r\nsubsequently somewhat modified; and the knowledge of fortification\r\nafterward exacted from a candidate was, “to be able to trace upon paper,\r\nin presence of the examiners, a front of fortification according to\r\nVauban’s first system, and also the profile of a rampart and parapet.”\r\nIn other subjects, modifications were also introduced; but the general\r\ncharacter of the examinations remained much the same as originally\r\nestablished, and the regulations introduced by the Duke of Wellington,\r\nin 1849, continued substantially in force, until the general revision of\r\nthe system of military education, which took place in 1857. It appears,\r\nhowever, from the evidence given by Lord Panmure, before the Royal\r\nCommission on the Purchase System, that, during the Crimean war, the\r\nstringency of the examinations was very much relaxed.\r\n\r\nThe examinations were held at Sandhurst by the professors of the\r\nCollege, in the presence of the Lieutenant-Governor, and were conducted\r\nto a great extent _vivâ voce_. The Select Committee of the House of\r\nCommons on Sandhurst (1855) did not make any recommendation in regard to\r\nthese examinations, but stated in their report that in the only branch\r\nof the examination which was of a military character, namely,\r\nfortification, the knowledge required would easily be mastered in a\r\nweek. The character of the examination, however, appears to have been\r\nvery generally regarded with dissatisfaction. Mr. Sidney Herbert, when\r\nSecretary at War, in 1854, criticised it severely, as being “too\r\ntechnical, too limited, and within its limits too severe,” and as\r\nleading necessarily to a candidate cramming up a few books which\r\nhappened to be in use at Sandhurst, without affording any test of\r\ngeneral education. He contemplated at that time a revision of the\r\nexaminations, and the institution of a special board of examiners, in\r\nplace of the Sandhurst professors, for the purpose of conducting them;\r\nand the Treasury, in connection with this subject, suggested that the\r\nmachinery proposed for the object in view should be combined, as far as\r\npracticable, with that about to be established for examining candidates\r\nfor the Civil Service.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the Crimean war prevented Mr. Sidney Herbert’s\r\nproposals, which were connected with a general plan for the instruction\r\nof officers, from being carried into effect; and in 1856, Lord Panmure,\r\nbefore the Purchase System Commission, spoke of the defects of the\r\nexisting examinations in nearly the same terms as those used by Mr.\r\nHerbert in 1854. After stating that they led to a system of cramming up\r\nparticular books, he laid down the principle that the examination\r\n“should be such as young men may be supposed capable of passing without\r\nhaving any particular professional education. It ought to be upon\r\ngeneral subjects, such as a young man ought to become acquainted with\r\nduring his passage through any high educational establishment in this\r\ncountry.”\r\n\r\nThe various schemes for the reorganization of military education brought\r\nunder the notice of Lord Panmure, at the end of 1856, proposed\r\nimprovements in the system of examinations for admission to the army;\r\nand nearly all the authorities consulted on the subject at that time\r\nappear to have concurred in the opinion that the examinations should be\r\nstrictly non-professional, and should be confined to requiring proof on\r\nthe part of the candidates of a knowledge of the ordinary subjects of\r\nliberal education. The commissioners appointed in the same year to\r\nconsider the training of officers for the scientific corps also\r\nrecommended that the examination of candidates for commissions, who did\r\nnot pass through a military college, should be of a general, and not of\r\na special, character.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Military Education, on their appointment, in April, 1857,\r\nwere instructed “to revise the whole system of examination for direct\r\nappointments to the army,” which is at present very defective; and this\r\nsubject was, in fact, the first of those referred to in their\r\ninstructions which they were directed to take into consideration. After\r\nconsultation with the head masters of some of the chief public schools\r\nof the country, with the view of ascertaining the amount of knowledge\r\nwhich might fairly be expected from young men of 17, the Council\r\nproposed a scheme of examination based on the fundamental principle that\r\nthe examination should be entirely non-professional, and confined to\r\nsubjects which form the course of ordinary liberal education at civil\r\nschools. Regulations founded upon the proposal of the Council were\r\nissued on the 1st of August, 1857, and it was announced that they would\r\ncome into operation at the beginning of 1858. These regulations were\r\nsubsequently modified in some of their details, even before the first\r\nexamination was held under the new system; further modifications have\r\nbeen from time to time introduced in them, without, however, affecting\r\ntheir general character; and the scheme proposed by the Council of 1857\r\nhas, in its main principles, formed the basis of all the regulations\r\nunder which examinations for direct commissions have been held to the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, from the evidence given before the Commission of\r\n1869, that it has been found necessary, from time to time, to diminish\r\nthe difficulty of the examinations, owing to the number of failures\r\namong the candidates, and that the present standard is considerably\r\nlower than that originally established. An acquaintance with French,\r\nEnglish history and geography, and drawing, was at first an\r\nindispensable condition of qualification, but is now no longer required;\r\nthe obligatory subjects of examination have thus been reduced from five\r\nto two--mathematics and English--while, at the same time, the amount of\r\nmathematical knowledge formerly exacted has been reduced.\r\n\r\nThe first examination under the new system took place in February, 1858.\r\nEven before this, at the end of 1857, the place of examination had been\r\ntransferred from Sandhurst to London, and the method of conducting the\r\nexaminations by printed papers, instead of by _vivâ voce_, had been\r\nadopted. The examinations have, ever since that period, been conducted\r\nby examiners appointed by the Council of Military Education, and have,\r\nas a rule, been held half yearly. By a regulation which has been for\r\nsome years in force, candidates for direct commissions are also\r\npermitted to be examined at foreign stations. The examination is, in\r\nthis case, conducted in the presence of a board appointed by the officer\r\ncommanding the station; but the method of examination is, in all other\r\nrespects, identical with that adopted at home. The examination papers\r\nare forwarded by, and the candidates’ replies are returned to, the\r\nCouncil of Military Education.\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed by the Council was intended to regulate admission to\r\nthe army in ordinary times of peace; but almost immediately after it had\r\nbeen formally approved, and before it had actually come into operation,\r\nthe pressure occasioned by the outbreak of the Indian Mutiny led to an\r\nabnormal condition of circumstances. In September, 1857, a circular was\r\nissued, announcing that commissions would be given without examination\r\non the condition of the applicant raising a certain number of recruits.\r\nIn March, however, of the following year, this temporary measure was\r\nabolished, the pressure for troops being no longer such as to render its\r\ncontinuance necessary. Since that period no candidates, with the\r\nexception of graduates of the universities, have obtained commissions\r\nwithout passing the regular examination.\r\n\r\nBefore 1862, candidates were eligible for commissions without purchase,\r\non passing the examination for direct appointments. Since that year,\r\nhowever, all free commissions have been reserved for cadets at\r\nSandhurst, and those who pass the direct examination have only obtained\r\ncommissions by purchase.\r\n\r\n  REGULATIONS IN FORCE IN 1869.\r\n\r\n  I. The examinations of candidates for direct commissions will be held\r\nin London at such periods as the exigencies of the service may require,\r\nand be conducted under the direction of the Council of Military\r\nEducation by examiners appointed for the purpose. The number of\r\ncandidates summoned to attend each examination will be limited to the\r\nrequirements of the service.\r\n\r\n  II. The age of candidates examined for direct appointments will be,\r\nuntil further notice, from 17 to 20 years for the infantry, from 17 to\r\n22 years for the cavalry, and from 17 to 26 years for colonial corps.\r\n\r\n  III. The candidate will be examined by a medical board, to ascertain\r\nthat he is in every point of view, as regards his physical constitution,\r\nfit for military service.\r\n\r\n  He will be required to produce the following certificates, which must\r\nbe forwarded to the Council of Military Education, 13 Great George\r\nstreet, S.W., as soon as possible after the receipt of the Military\r\nSecretary’s order to attend for examination:\r\n\r\n  (_a._) A certificate of baptism, or other satisfactory proof of his\r\nage.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) A certificate from a minister of the church or of the\r\ndenomination to which he belongs, that he has been duly instructed in\r\nthe principles of religion.\r\n\r\n  (_c._) A certificate of good moral character, signed by a clergyman of\r\nthe parish to which he belongs, or by the tutor or head of the school or\r\ncollege at which he has received his education, for at least the two\r\npreceding years; or such other proof of good moral character as will be\r\nsatisfactory to the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n  (_d._) A statement of the subjects in which he wishes to be examined.\r\n\r\n  IV. The following will be the subjects of examination, but no\r\ncandidate will be allowed to be examined in more than _five_ of these\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n                                                               Marks.\r\n    The classics { Latin,                                      2,000\r\n                 { Greek,                                      1,600\r\n    Mathematics, pure and mixed,                               3,600\r\n    English language,                                          1,200\r\n    Modern languages (not including provincial dialects) each, 1,200\r\n    History, ancient and modern, with geography,               1,200\r\n    Natural sciences, _i.e._, mineralogy and geology,     1,200\r\n    Experimental sciences, _i.e._, chemistry, heat,\r\n        electricity, including magnetism,                      1,200\r\n    Drawing,                                                     600\r\n\r\n  V. Of the foregoing subjects, the elementary branches of mathematics\r\nand the English language, to the extent stated in the following\r\nparagraphs, will be considered obligatory:\r\n\r\n  1. In mathematics, 1,200 marks will be given to the following\r\nobligatory portions, viz., arithmetic, including vulgar and decimal\r\nfractions, proportion, extraction of the square root, and simple\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n  Algebra, including fractions, simple equations, and questions\r\nproducing them: Euclid, the first three books.\r\n\r\n  Of the 1,200 marks allotted to the foregoing portions of mathematics,\r\n400 will be required for qualification, and of these at least 200 must\r\nbe obtained in arithmetic.\r\n\r\n  2. In the English language, the candidate will be required to write\r\ncorrectly and in a good legible hand from dictation, and to compose\r\ngrammatically. He will be required to obtain at least 200 marks in this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n  3. Out of the remaining subjects the candidate may select any three.\r\n\r\n  4. No candidate will be allowed to count the marks gained in any one\r\nof the three voluntary subjects, unless amounting to one-sixth of the\r\nwhole number of marks allotted to that subject; and for qualification,\r\nhe will be required to obtain on his five subjects a total of 1,500\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\n  5. In the examination in classics, passages will be given for\r\ntranslation from the books usually read at schools; grammatical\r\nquestions will be set, and English passages also given for translation\r\ninto the Latin and Greek languages.\r\n\r\n  VI. The result of each examination will be reported to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and the names of any candidates who distinguish\r\nthemselves will be specially brought to his notice.\r\n\r\n  VII. An unsuccessful candidate will not be debarred from applying to\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief for permission to attend a future examination. No\r\ncandidate, however, will be allowed more than three trials.\r\n\r\n  Should a candidate obtain only between 700 and 1,200 marks, he will\r\nnot be allowed to present himself for reëxamination for at least six\r\nmonths. If he obtains less than 700 marks, a period of at least twelve\r\nmonths must elapse before he can be allowed to present himself again.\r\n\r\n  In all cases permission to be reëxamined must depend upon the number\r\nof applicants on the list.\r\n\r\n  In subsequent examinations no credit will be given for the marks\r\ngained by a candidate on former occasions.\r\n\r\n  In the event of a candidate not appearing for examination at the time\r\nappointed, such candidate will not be permitted to attend on the next\r\noccasion, and he will render himself liable to have his name either\r\nerased entirely or placed at the bottom of the list of those noted for\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n  VIII. A student at either of the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge,\r\nDublin, London, St. Andrew’s, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, or Queen’s\r\nUniversity, Ireland, who shall have passed the examination necessary for\r\ntaking a degree in arts, is qualified for a commission by purchase\r\nwithout being required to pass the foregoing examination, provided he is\r\nwithin the limits of 17 and 23 years of age if for the infantry, 17 and\r\n25 years if for the cavalry, and of 17 and 28 years for colonial corps,\r\nand can produce the certificates marked (_a_), (_b_), and (_c_).\r\n\r\n  Such candidate must furnish a certificate of having graduated, or of\r\nhaving passed the examinations, signed by the Registrar of the\r\nUniversity, and showing the date on which the examination took place.\r\n\r\n  On his application being approved, the candidate will receive an order\r\nto be medically examined as to his physical fitness for the service.\r\n\r\n  The candidate will address his application, accompanied by the\r\nnecessary certificates, to the Military Secretary, Horse Guards.\r\n\r\nIII. PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATION AS PREPARATORY TO MILITARY EXAMINATIONS.\r\n\r\nA.--GENERAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the Modern Departments, at some public schools,\r\ntechnical instruction in military subjects is actually at present given.\r\nThis, for instance, is the case at Cheltenham College, the Modern\r\nDepartment at which appears, in fact, to have been originally instituted\r\nwith the express object of affording means of special military\r\neducation, and at the present day is officially called the “Military and\r\nCivil Department.” At one time, also, even at some schools in which\r\nModern Departments did not exist, classes were formed in which\r\ninstruction in military subjects was given to boys intended for the\r\narmy. Both at Eton and at Harrow such classes existed, and fortification\r\nand military drawing were taught in them. The object of the formation of\r\nthese classes appears in both cases to have been to enable boys to go up\r\nstraight from school to the examinations for admission to the army,\r\nwithout the necessity of having recourse to private tuition. At the time\r\nof their institution a knowledge of fortification was required in the\r\nexamination for direct commissions, and a candidate was therefore unable\r\nto present himself for this examination without some special\r\npreparation. At the commencement of 1858, however, the direct commission\r\nexaminations were entirely remodelled; the small amount of fortification\r\npreviously required was at that time excluded from the subjects of\r\nexamination, which have ever since been of a non-professional character,\r\nand more or less such as enter into the course of ordinary liberal\r\neducation. With the exclusion of technical subjects from the military\r\nexaminations, the necessity for any special instruction in such subjects\r\nin candidates for admission to the army ceased. The military class at\r\nHarrow seems to have died out within a few years of its establishment;\r\nit has not been in existence during the last ten years and more. At\r\nEton, though the corresponding class is still maintained, the teaching\r\nof technical military subjects in it has been abandoned. Even in the\r\nModern Department at Cheltenham the instruction appears of late years to\r\nhave become of a less decidedly military character than it originally\r\nwas; and fortification, which was at one time taught at Wellington\r\nCollege, no longer enters into the course of instruction there. In the\r\nModern Side, which has within the present year been established at\r\nHarrow, though partially intended, among other purposes, to assist the\r\neducation of boys intended for the army, no attempt is made to give\r\nspecial military instruction.\r\n\r\nThe question of the possibility of affording an adequate military\r\neducation at civil schools was fully discussed by the Commissioners\r\nappointed in 1856 to consider the training of officers for the\r\nscientific corps.\r\n\r\n  Having arrived at the conclusion that professional military education\r\nas hitherto given in this country has been begun at too early an age, we\r\nare met by what may be called the extreme opposite view, which would\r\nsuggest the desirableness of giving up altogether education in military\r\ncolleges previously to entering the army, or to entering a purely\r\npractical class or college for the special corps of Artillery and\r\nEngineers. An opinion appears to exist that the ordinary schools of the\r\ncountry are the best means of giving nearly the whole teaching of\r\ngeneral and even military science which is desirable for all classes of\r\nofficers before entering the army. It seems to be thought that not only\r\nmodern languages and mathematics, but military history and topography\r\nare likely to be taught in such schools sufficiently for the highest\r\nmilitary purposes, and that even young men intended for the special arms\r\nof the service may, on joining a military academy, be absolved, or\r\nalmost entirely absolved, from any other studies than those included\r\nunder the expression “_a purely practical course_.”\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners expressed their unhesitating dissent from this view.\r\nAfter pointing out the difficulties of giving at ordinary schools a\r\ncomplete preparation even in studies of a general preparatory character,\r\nsuch as modern languages and mathematics, and the still greater\r\ndifficulties of teaching special subjects, like military history and\r\ntopography, the Report proceeds:\r\n\r\n  Agreeing, therefore, as to the fact of a “sound general education\r\nbeing given by public schools,” we are unable to draw from it the\r\nconclusion that they will “give a specific military education.” They may\r\nindeed assist our military education, in a manner which the true sense\r\nof the term “sound general education” expresses, by encouraging\r\npreliminary tastes and studies, such as general history, mathematics,\r\nand modern languages, English included, to a greater extent than they do\r\nat present. But if there is such a thing as a science of war at all, it\r\nstands to reason that it can only be taught fully in cases where young\r\nofficers have the passion and the capacity to begin it early, by its own\r\nteachers, and in its own place. The teachers should be practical men, as\r\nwell as men of military science; the place a military college. And the\r\ngreat schools of the country will perform the same service to such an\r\nacademy for young scientific officers as they do for places which give a\r\nspecific education for other professions; they will _prepare for it_,\r\nbut disclaim any attempt to _complete it_.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Public Schools Commission does not appear to have made\r\nany direct reference to the question of the possibility of giving\r\ntechnical military instruction at civil schools; but the disinclination\r\nshown by the Commissioners to recommend even the general institution of\r\n“Modern Departments” would lead to the conclusion that they were not\r\ndisposed to view with favor the introduction of any system of special\r\ninstruction into the ordinary school course.\r\n\r\nThe question has been dealt with at considerable length in the evidence\r\ntaken before the present Commission. In addition to the evidence given\r\nby Dr. Barry, Mr. Southwood, Dr. Benson, and Dr. Temple, to which\r\nparticular reference is made in the Report, opinions on the subject were\r\nexpressed by several military witnesses. Major-General Sir P. Herbert\r\nconsiders that all which is learnt at Sandhurst--all the knowledge\r\nrequisite for a line officer--might equally well be acquired at a public\r\nschool, if proper arrangements were made for teaching it. In his opinion\r\nfortification (including the practical construction of field-works),\r\nmilitary drawing and surveying, military history and drill, could all be\r\ntaught by military instructors at public schools without difficulty, and\r\nwithout interference with the subjects of general education.\r\nMajor-General White considers that military history, modern languages,\r\nand drawing might be taught with advantage at public schools to boys\r\nintended for the army, although it would be difficult to teach the\r\npractical work of field fortification, artillery, and surveying. Colonel\r\nBaker appears to be of opinion that at the Universities, certainly, a\r\nspecial preliminary education might be given to candidates for the army,\r\non a system similar to that which it was at one time proposed to\r\nintroduce at Cambridge, but which does not appear to have ever been\r\nactually adopted. At the same time, though this instruction would be of\r\na special character, Colonel Baker does not seem to contemplate its\r\nembracing strictly technical military subjects. On the other hand, His\r\nRoyal Highness the Duke of Cambridge is of opinion that special military\r\nclasses at public schools would fail; Major-General Sir F. Abbott thinks\r\nit unnecessary to establish such classes; Colonel Hort is decidedly\r\nopposed to an attempt to give military instruction at any but a military\r\ncollege, on the ground that it could not be so effectively given at a\r\ncivil establishment, and would, moreover, interfere with the acquisition\r\nof a general education; and Lieut.-General Sir D. Cameron considers that\r\nit would be impossible for public schools to give a thorough or perfect\r\nknowledge of the practical subjects taught at Sandhurst, such as\r\nfortification, artillery, military drawing, and surveying.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the same subject suggestions have been made by some\r\nwitnesses that the Government should assign a certain number of free\r\ncommissions annually, as prizes to be competed for, either at particular\r\npublic schools, or more generally amongst candidates educated at such\r\nschools. The institution of military exhibitions or scholarships at\r\ncivil schools, and of military degrees at the Universities, has been\r\nalso suggested. By some witnesses these proposals are advocated with the\r\nspecial view of inducing public schools to adopt a system of military\r\ninstruction; by others with the more general object of holding out\r\nincreased encouragement to enter the service to candidates who have had\r\nthe advantage of a public school education.\r\n\r\nAlthough the question of giving military instruction at public schools\r\nwas not specially discussed by the Public School Commissioners, their\r\nattention was directed to the results of public school education in\r\npreparing candidates for the military examinations. Their Report speaks\r\nas follows in reference to this subject:\r\n\r\n  The number of public-school boys who enter the army is not large. Of\r\n1,976 candidates for direct commissions within three years, 122 only had\r\nbeen at any of these schools. Of these 102 succeeded and 20 failed. It\r\nwill be observed, on reference to the returns, that this proportion of\r\nfailures is considerably below the average; the public school men,\r\ntherefore, were better prepared than the general run of candidates. Of\r\n96 who passed at their first examination, 38 came immediately from\r\nschool, 58 had had intermediate tuition. Of the 20 who failed, 14 had\r\nhad such tuition.\r\n\r\n  The public-school candidates for Sandhurst during the same period were\r\n23 out of 375; the proportion who succeeded being here also above the\r\naverage. Of 18 who succeeded, 11 came straight from school; of five who\r\nfailed, only one.\r\n\r\n  The scheme of examinations for direct commissions, framed to meet the\r\nsuggestions of the Head Masters of public schools, is simple and easy,\r\nand requires nothing that is beyond the reach of any boy of moderate\r\nindustry and ordinary capacity; and it is clear that no boy, who will\r\ngive himself a little trouble, needs to forego the wholesome influences\r\nof a great school for the sake of being “crammed” in the house of a\r\ntutor. The Sandhurst examination is also evidently within the reach of\r\nthe schools.\r\n\r\n  The qualifying examination for Woolwich appears, before 1862, to have\r\nrequired an amount of mathematical knowledge difficult of attainment for\r\na boy educated at a public school; but it underwent in that year some\r\nchanges which have made it easier for candidates who have not received a\r\nspecial training. The obligatory mathematics do not now go beyond plane\r\ntrigonometry; and a candidate need not obtain in them, to qualify, more\r\nthan 700 marks out of 3,500; with this minimum, and with a fair\r\nproficiency in Latin, Greek, French, and geometrical drawing, he is\r\nentitled to enter into the competition. This standard is certainly not\r\nso high as to be inaccessible to a boy educated at a good public school,\r\nand from a table showing the working of the scheme at the examination of\r\nJanuary, 1863, it appears that of the 20 successful competitors, 11\r\ndistinguished themselves in classics; the other marks were chiefly\r\ngained in mathematics and French. In three years, previous to this\r\nchange, 35 public-school candidates passed and 49 failed to pass the\r\nqualifying examination, the totals being 545 and 689. Of the whole 84,\r\ntwo only went direct from the schools, and these failed.\r\n\r\n  In another passage the Commissioners say: “The main studies of the\r\npublic schools being classical, it is obvious that, unless a due amount\r\nof weight is given to the classics in the Woolwich examinations, boys\r\nfrom those schools will not stand a fair chance in the competition. On\r\nthe other hand, as it is of importance that the examinations should\r\ncomprise other subjects besides classics, it is also obvious that unless\r\nthe public schools provide a due amount of instruction in those other\r\nsubjects, the candidates whom they send up must compete at a\r\ndisadvantage. It is certain that there has hitherto been a want of\r\nadjustment between the Woolwich standard and the teaching of the public\r\nschools. The fault, we think, lies chiefly, though not wholly, in the\r\ndeficiencies in the course of education pursued at the latter; and we\r\nare convinced that when these deficiencies have been supplied the\r\ndifficulty which is now complained of will speedily disappear. But it is\r\nalso to be observed, with respect to the Woolwich examinations\r\nthemselves, that the scale of marks has lately (as we have already\r\nstated) undergone an alteration, which diminishes the amount of\r\nmathematical attainment required, and allows greater weight to classical\r\nscholarship. It appears probable that the Modern Departments at\r\nCheltenham and Marlborough would not have been what they are had the old\r\nWoolwich standard, which is stated to have influenced them so strongly,\r\nbeen the same as the present; and probable, also, that they will\r\nhereafter feel the effects of the change which has been made in it.”\r\n\r\nIII. EXAMINATIONS FOR PROMOTIONS.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\nExaminations for promotion were for the first time instituted shortly\r\nafter the introduction of examinations for admission to the army, by the\r\nDuke of Wellington when Commander-in-Chief, in the year 1850. A circular\r\nmemorandum, published on the 14th of May of that year, announced that\r\nall officers would in future be subjected to an examination previously\r\nto promotion to the respective ranks of lieutenant and captain. The\r\nfirst examination was to be confined to subjects connected with the\r\nrudiments of drill, regimental duties, interior economy, and the Mutiny\r\nAct and Articles of War. The second examination for the rank of captain\r\nwas in addition to extend to more general subjects, and to include\r\ngeography, ancient and modern history, mathematics, and field and\r\npermanent fortification; but the examination in these subjects was not\r\nintended to affect lieutenants who had entered the service previously to\r\n1849.\r\n\r\nThe examination for promotion to the rank of lieutenant was to be\r\nconducted regimentally by the commanding officer and the two next senior\r\nofficers of the candidate’s regiment. The purely professional portion of\r\nthe second examination, for the rank of captain, was to be conducted in\r\nthe same manner; with regard to the mode of testing the candidates’\r\nqualifications in the more general subjects required in this\r\nexamination, it was stated that such orders would be given in each\r\nindividual case as the Commander-in-Chief might think proper and\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThese regulations continued in force up to the time of the institution\r\nof the Council of Military Education in 1857, although it appears, both\r\nfrom official statements made by the Secretary at War, and from numerous\r\nexpressions of opinion in Parliament between the years 1854 and 1857,\r\nthat, at least so far as regarded the second examination for the rank of\r\ncaptain, little attempt was made, even nominally, to enforce the\r\nregulations. Mr. Sidney Herbert proposed, in 1854, in connection with\r\nhis general scheme of military education, to remodel the examinations\r\nand to institute a special machinery for conducting them; and though no\r\nactual steps were taken to carry out his proposal, the necessity of\r\nmaking the examinations real and genuine tests of professional\r\nknowledge, and of enforcing strict qualifications for promotion, was\r\nfrequently recognized in the numerous discussions which took place in\r\nParliament on the subject of military education during the course of the\r\nCrimean War.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Military Education, on their appointment in 1857, were\r\ndirected to consider the question of the professional examination of\r\nofficers for promotion up to the rank of captain, and in the course of\r\nthe year submitted a proposal on this subject, in connection with a\r\nscheme for providing instruction for officers after entering the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nNew regulations on the subject were issued on the 19th of July, 1858,\r\nwhich, while introducing little change in regard to the examination of\r\ncornets and ensigns, rendered a knowledge of mathematics, history, and\r\nfortification no longer requisite in the second examination for the rank\r\nof captain. Geography, on the other hand, was still retained among the\r\nsubjects, and, as a condition of promotion to a captaincy, a lieutenant\r\nwas required “to be able to state the general divisions of the world,\r\nthe name of the capital of each nation in Europe, and the principal\r\nrivers, seaports, and military posts in Great Britain, Ireland, and Her\r\nMajesty’s Dominions in every part of the world.” The examinations of\r\ncornets and ensigns still continued to be conducted regimentally; that\r\nof lieutenants, so far as related to matters of regimental economy,\r\ndetail, or discipline, was to be made by boards of officers appointed by\r\nthe commanding officer at the station, consisting, when possible, of\r\nthree senior officers not of the same corps as the candidate.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1858, revised regulations were issued, which, in accordance\r\nwith the recommendations of the Council of Military Education, made\r\nconsiderable changes in the examinations, and placed them on their\r\npresent basis. The subjects of regimental and ordinary duties on which\r\ncandidates were to be examined were more minutely detailed than\r\nheretofore; the examinations were made entirely professional, geography\r\nbeing excluded from the second examination, and at the same time it was\r\nannounced that lieutenants would be required to show a sufficient\r\nknowledge of reconnaissance and of field fortification. But the most\r\nimportant change made at this time was in regard to the mode of\r\nconducting the examinations, which were no longer to be carried on\r\nregimentally, but by a board appointed by the commanding officer of the\r\ndistrict, consisting (if possible) of three field officers,--with the\r\nadditional provision that in no case in which it could possibly be\r\navoided, an officer of the same regiment as the candidate was to be a\r\nmember of the board. Cornets and ensigns were to be required to pass the\r\nexamination before completing eight months’ service; and, in order to\r\ngive additional stringency to the regulations, it was announced that the\r\nCommander-in-Chief would “not hesitate to promote (either regimentally\r\nor from other corps) officers who may have passed the required\r\nexamination, in place of the idle and incompetent.”\r\n\r\n  REGULATIONS IN FORCE IN 1869.\r\n\r\n  _Infantry and Cavalry._\r\n\r\n  159. Before officers are recommended for promotion to the rank of\r\nlieutenant, the commanding officer is to apply to the senior officer of\r\nthe district or station for a board to examine and report upon their\r\nqualifications as under:\r\n\r\n    (_a._) They must have a thorough knowledge, and must give an\r\naccount, of the duties they have to perform as regimental orderly\r\nofficers, as officers commanding guards, or as subaltern officers of\r\nguards under officers of superior rank.\r\n\r\n    (_b._) They must have a thorough knowledge of, and be able to put a\r\ncompany through the various exercises and evolutions prescribed in the\r\nfirst two parts of the “Field Exercises of the Infantry;” and they must\r\nbe acquainted with the rifle drill and practice, and the theoretical\r\nprinciples of musketry, as defined in the authorized book of\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\n    (_c._) They must know exactly the place of all the company officers\r\nin every situation of the battalion, and be able to command a company in\r\nbattalion exercise.\r\n\r\n    (_d._) They must be acquainted with such parts of the Queen’s\r\nRegulations and Orders for the Army as relate to the duties, and conduct\r\nof a subaltern officer, and with the Mutiny Act and Articles of War, so\r\nfar as is necessary for the performance of their duties as members of a\r\ncourt-martial.\r\n\r\n    (_e._) They must be acquainted with the regulations of the army in\r\nregard to the pay and messing of the troops, the supply of clothing and\r\nnecessaries, and all details regarding the weight of, and mode of\r\ncarrying, the various articles of the soldier’s kit, arms,\r\naccoutrements, and ammunition.\r\n\r\n  160. In addition to such portions of the foregoing as may apply to the\r\ncavalry service, it is necessary in the case of cornets recommended for\r\npromotion to the rank of lieutenant,--\r\n\r\n    (_a._) That they shall have learnt their foot drill and sword\r\nexercise, and have been instructed in the single and double ride.\r\n\r\n    (_b._) That they shall be able to put a troop through the carbine,\r\nlance, and sword exercise, and to exercise both a squad and troop in the\r\ndrill and evolutions prescribed in the Cavalry Exercise Book.\r\n\r\n    (_c._) That they shall be able to command a troop in squadron\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n    (_d._) That they shall have made themselves masters of the detail of\r\nsaddlery, the mode of fitting the saddle, bridle, etc., and of the whole\r\nequipment of the cavalry soldier and his horse.\r\n\r\n  161. Lieutenants in the Cavalry and Infantry will, in addition to the\r\nforegoing, before they are recommended for promotion to the rank of\r\ncaptain, be required to show that they are further duly qualified as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    (_a._) They must have a thorough knowledge of the provisions of the\r\nMutiny Act and Articles of War, and of the forms and proceedings of\r\ncourts-martial, and must give evidence of having studied some of the\r\nstandard works on military law.\r\n\r\n    (_b._) They must understand perfectly the evolutions of a regiment\r\nof cavalry or a battalion of infantry, as laid down in the regulations\r\nfor those services respectively.\r\n\r\n    (_c._) They must be acquainted with the light infantry drill, duties\r\nof outposts, patrols, escorts, advanced and rear guards.\r\n\r\n    (_d._) They must perfectly understand the interior economy of a\r\ntroop or company, and the established system of keeping their accounts.\r\n\r\n    (_e._) They must be thoroughly acquainted with the Queen’s and War\r\nOffice Regulations applicable to their own branch of the service.\r\n\r\n    (_f._) They must be competent to take charge of a troop, company, or\r\ndetachment, in every position in which it may be placed.\r\n\r\n    (_g._) And they will be required to show that they have a sufficient\r\nknowledge of field fortification and reconnaissance.\r\n\r\n  162. The board of examination is to consist, if possible, of three\r\nfield officers; but on no occasion, when it can be avoided, is any\r\nofficer of the same regiment as the candidate to be a member. In all\r\ncases the board will ascertain by practical examination, as well as by\r\nverbal and written answers to questions, whether the officer is\r\ninstructed in the subjects specified in the preceding paragraphs. The\r\nquestions are to be written on half margin, and the replies written\r\nopposite to them. The board will mark in red ink its correction of any\r\nmistakes in the answers, and will certify in each case that “the\r\ncandidate has not received any assistance from books or other sources.”\r\nThe report of the board to be on a separate sheet, and when officers of\r\ndifferent regiments are examined by the same board, the report in\r\nconnection with each regiment is to be made separately.\r\n\r\n  163. The general officer commanding will forward the report of the\r\nboard, and the written questions and replies, to the adjutant-general,\r\naccompanied by his own observations thereon, regarding the nature of the\r\nexamination, the correctness of the answers, and the eligibility of the\r\nofficer examined.\r\n\r\n  164. Every cornet or ensign is to be examined on the different points\r\nherein specified, before he has completed one year’s service; and should\r\nhe fail to qualify himself for promotion within that period, his\r\ncommanding officer must report, through the general officer commanding,\r\nfor the information of the Commander-in-Chief, whether it is owing to a\r\nwant of diligence and attention on the part of the officer, or to\r\nsickness, or other circumstances over which he could have had no\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n  165. No officer will be recommended for promotion to the rank either\r\nof lieutenant or captain unless his examination papers and certificate\r\nof qualification have been received by the Military Secretary; but the\r\nCommander-in-Chief will, in all cases, select the senior officer who may\r\nhave qualified for promotion to the higher grade.\r\n\r\n  _Artillery._\r\n\r\n  166. The examination of lieutenants of artillery for the rank of\r\ncaptain will include all the subjects required from officers of the line\r\nof corresponding rank, except that a general knowledge only of the\r\nevolutions of cavalry and infantry will suffice. In addition to the\r\nforegoing, lieutenants of artillery are to be examined as to their\r\nacquaintance with the more special duties of their arm of the service.\r\nThe following will serve as a guide:\r\n\r\n    (_a._) Field-gun drill. Exercise of heavy guns on ground and\r\ntraversing platforms, mortar drill, rocket drill, Armstrong gun drill,\r\npractice with hot shot and molten iron shells, gun and transporting\r\ncarriage drill.\r\n\r\n    (_b._) General duties of the men, and principles involved in\r\nmounting and dismounting ordnance generally, in placing guns on towers,\r\nin embarking and disembarking ordnance, and in moving ordnance up steep\r\ninclines; also the tackle, etc., required in the above operations.\r\n\r\n    (_c._) Different pieces of ordnance in use throughout the service at\r\nthe time of examination, their weight and calibre, and special purpose.\r\n\r\n    (_d._) Ammunition employed with ordnance generally; ammunition\r\nemployed with Armstrong guns; general construction of a Congreve rocket,\r\nand the principle of its motion; manufacture and action of fuzes and\r\ntubes; the advantages of the rifle action, and the principle upon which\r\nit depends; essential points with regard to rifling ordnance: general\r\nprinciples of breaching; position and employment of artillery in the\r\nfield; considerations which regulate the rapidity of artillery fire;\r\nprinciples connected with the construction of artillery carriages;\r\ngeneral knowledge of laboratory duties.\r\n\r\n    (_e._) Embarking and disembarking horses; management of horses on\r\nboard ship.\r\n\r\n    (_f._) To be able to define technical artillery terms, etc., in such\r\na way as to make them understood by the non-commissioned officers and\r\nmen under their command, such as,--1, point blank; 2, point blank range;\r\n3, dispart; 4, chambers; 5, preponderance; 6, different kinds of\r\nartillery fire; 7, how elevation gives an increase of range; 8, windage;\r\n9, deviation, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    (_g._) Subalterns who have been one year or more in the horse\r\nbrigade, or in a field battery, will be required, in addition to the\r\nforegoing subjects, to be thoroughly acquainted with stable duties, and\r\nhorse artillery or field battery movements and details. All must have a\r\ngeneral knowledge of these subjects.\r\n\r\n  167. Every officer, on becoming the thirtieth on the list of\r\nlieutenants, must be prepared to undergo the required examination. Any\r\nofficer, after four years’ service, may apply for such examination at an\r\nearlier period.\r\n\r\n  168. Instructions will, from time to time, be issued to the general or\r\nother officer commanding districts or stations, to assemble a board, to\r\nconsist of three officers, viz., a field officer (of the artillery, if\r\npossible), an officer of the staff, and a captain of artillery, or an\r\nofficer of that corps who may already have passed the examination.\r\nEither the gunnery instructor or the fire-master should, when\r\npracticable, be selected for this duty. If it be impossible to obtain a\r\nstaff officer, a captain of the line should be substituted; if a second\r\nofficer of artillery cannot be had, an officer of engineers should be\r\nsubstituted; but either the president or one member must be of the\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\n  169. That portion of the examination which can be best replied to in\r\nwriting will be conducted by means of questions prepared by the deputy\r\nadjutant-general of artillery, and forwarded to the general officer\r\ncommanding the district. The _vivâ voce_ and practical examination will\r\nbe conducted by the board of officers, who will satisfy themselves that\r\nthe officer under examination not only possesses the requisite knowledge\r\nhimself, but that he is able to impart that knowledge in a clear and\r\nsatisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n  170. The board will then forward, through the general officer, its\r\nreport, together with the written answers, to the adjutant-general of\r\nthe forces; and, in returning to him the written answers, the president\r\nof the board will certify that they are the _bonâ fide_ performances of\r\nthe candidates, without assistance. The written papers will then be\r\nexamined by the deputy adjutant-general of artillery, and the result,\r\ntogether with the opinion of the board, reported to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\nROYAL WARRANT OF OCTOBER 30, 1871.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the abolition of the whole system of purchase, sale, or\r\nexchange for money, of commissions in the army, by Royal Warrant, dated\r\nJuly 20, 1871, certain changes in respect to first appointments,\r\nregimental promotion, and exchanges, became necessary, and were provided\r\nfor in the Royal Warrant issued October 30, 1871, which became operative\r\non the first day of November following. By these regulations, the first\r\nstep in official rank is that of Sub-Lieutenant; the rank of Cornet and\r\nEnsign being no longer recognized. As a general rule, the final\r\nappointments will be given only to successful candidates at a\r\ncompetitive examination. These will be probationary, and revocable in\r\ncase the unfitness of the incumbents shall be demonstrated by practical\r\ntrial in their work. From the Memorandum of the Secretary of War (Edward\r\nCardwell), which accompanies the Warrant, we cite the following as\r\ndefining the present system of original appointments and promotion.\r\n\r\n  Commissions as Lieutenants will be given to all Cornets and Ensigns\r\nappointed before the 26th of August, 1871, and to Cornets and Ensigns\r\nappointed since that date from the A List at Sandhurst, their\r\ncommissions to date from the first of November.\r\n\r\n  Commissions as Sub-Lieutenants will be given to:\r\n\r\n  (_a._) All other Cornets and Ensigns appointed after the 26th of\r\nAugust, 1871, the rank of Cornet and Ensign being abolished.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) Candidates who have passed the examination for Direct\r\nCommissions, in their turn as vacancies occur.\r\n\r\n  (_c._) Candidates for commissions in the Household Cavalry and Foot\r\nGuards who are nominated to fill the vacancies which occur in those\r\nregiments, before the date of the first competitive examination for\r\nSub-Lieutenancies, and who pass a qualifying examination.\r\n\r\n  (_d._) Candidates from the Universities now on the\r\nCommander-in-Chief’s list.\r\n\r\n  Sub-Lieutenants will be attached for a year to regiments at home. They\r\nwill then be required to go through a course of instruction, and on\r\npassing a practical professional examination, be commissioned to\r\nregiments as Lieutenants. They will be under strict discipline, and will\r\nbe liable to be removed for unfitness, either moral or physical, and for\r\nmisconduct. Those unsuited to the Cavalry may be transferred to the\r\nInfantry.\r\n\r\n  In dating their commissions they will be allowed a portion, not\r\nexceeding one year, of their services as Sub-Lieutenants; the time\r\nallowed being determined by the class of certificate they receive after\r\ntheir year’s regimental training, their conduct while under instruction,\r\nand their position at the final examination. Their service for\r\nretirement will reckon from the date of their commissions as\r\nLieutenants.\r\n\r\n  Candidates who have passed the examination for direct commissions, and\r\nhave also passed satisfactorily through a year’s course of study at the\r\nRoyal Military College before being appointed to be Sub-Lieutenants, and\r\nSandhurst Cadets from the B List will be commissioned to regiments as\r\nLieutenants on serving satisfactorily for twelve months with a regiment\r\nas Sub-Lieutenants.\r\n\r\n  There are now a large number of supernumerary officers, and also a\r\nlarge number of candidates who have passed for commissions.\r\n\r\n  The absorption of supernumerary officers will probably be completed,\r\nand the candidates who have passed for commissions have received their\r\nappointments in about two years from the present time, and personal\r\nappointments in the Army will then only be given as follows:\r\n\r\n  (_a._) To successful candidates at a competitive examination.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) To non-commissioned officers recommended for promotion by the\r\nField-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n  (_c._) To candidates from the Universities.\r\n\r\n  (_d._) To Queen’s Cadets, Indian Cadets, and Pages of Honor.\r\n\r\n  (_e._) To Lieutenants of Militia.\r\n\r\n  The competitive examination will be carried out by the Civil Service\r\nCommissioners; the standard of qualification being that recommended by\r\nthe Royal Commission on Military Education. Ample notice will be given\r\nof the first examination, and there will be no advantage in any\r\napplications being made for admission to be examined before the\r\npublication of such notice.\r\n\r\n  Non-commissioned officers, on being selected for promotion, will pass\r\nan examination in certain professional subjects; and then, after twelve\r\nmonths’ satisfactory service as Sub-Lieutenants, will receive\r\ncommissions as Lieutenants.\r\n\r\n  A certain number of Sub-Lieutenancies a year will be allotted to\r\ncandidates who have passed the University examination specified in the\r\nRegulations. If they also pass the examination for the degree of B.A.,\r\nthey will be allowed two years’ extension of the limit of age.\r\nUniversity candidates will be required to give at least six months’\r\nnotice of their desire to be admitted into the Army. If in any year\r\nthere should be more candidates than appointments, the requisite number\r\nwill be chosen by competition between the candidates; after their\r\nappointment they will go through the same course as other\r\nSub-Lieutenants.\r\n\r\n  There will be no vacancies for two years for any candidates from the\r\nUniversities whose names are not now on the Commander-in-Chief’s list.\r\n\r\n  Queen’s and Indian Cadets and Queen’s Pages will be required to pass a\r\nqualifying examination, which for the present will be the same as that\r\nrecommended by the Royal Commission on Military Education. The\r\nnominations will remain as heretofore. When appointed, Cadets and Pages\r\nwill go through the same course as other Sub-Lieutenants.\r\n\r\n  First appointments as Subalterns in the Militia will be made on the\r\nrecommendation of the Lieutenants of counties. Candidates, before\r\nreceiving their Commissions as Lieutenants in the Militia, will be\r\nrequired to pass a qualifying examination in general subjects equal to\r\nthe standard fixed as necessary for a candidate for a Sub-Lieutenancy.\r\nThey will next be required to be attached to a regiment of the Line for\r\nthree months, or such time as may be necessary to teach them their\r\ndrill. After serving with their Militia regiments for two annual\r\ntrainings, they will be eligible for the appointment of Lieutenants in\r\nthe Army. In order to obtain such an appointment they must be\r\nrecommended by the commanding officer of their Militia regiment, his\r\nrecommendation being confirmed by the general officer commanding the\r\ndistrict, and they will be required to pass an examination in\r\nprofessional subjects of the same kind as that which will be required of\r\na Sub-Lieutenant before he receives his commission as Lieutenant.\r\n\r\n  The limits of age, except for non-commissioned officers, will be fixed\r\nat from seventeen to twenty for Sub-Lieutenants, the limit being raised\r\nto twenty-two in the case of candidates who have passed their\r\nexamination for the degree of B.A. at the Universities, and from\r\nnineteen to twenty-two for Lieutenants from the Militia.\r\n\r\n  In addition to the examinations hitherto required from regimental\r\nofficers, those who are promoted to the rank of Captain after the 1st of\r\nNovember will, before being promoted to the rank of Major, be required,\r\nto pass a professional examination.\r\n\r\nThe General Order promulgating the Royal Warrant and the Memorandum of\r\nSecretary Caldwell contains the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n  His Royal Highness the Field-Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, in\r\npromulgating these regulations to the Army, would desire to impress upon\r\neach individual officer, and especially upon those of junior standing\r\nwho have still a name to make in the service, that they must more than\r\never rely upon their own exertions, upon their professional knowledge\r\nand ability, upon their general character and conduct as officers, and\r\nthe opinion with which they impress their military superiors, for\r\nadvancement in the service.\r\n\r\n  _Examiners Employed by Council of Military Education._\r\n\r\n  _Mathematics._--Rev.

The staff of examiners should be composed of changing as well\r\nas of permanent members, and when the service is professional, an expert\r\nshould be called in. The entire work of the Civil Service Commission,\r\nincluding the India Service, is done by one Commissioner, the Secretary,\r\nand his permanent examiners, with occasional assistants.\r\n\r\n  _Expenses of Council of Military Education._\r\n\r\n  _Year._        £      _s._ _d._\r\n  1858-59,      6,325    3    1\r\n  1859-60,      6,956    7    7\r\n  1860-61,      7,757   12    1\r\n  1861-62,      7,789   14    3\r\n  1862-63,      7,681   17    6\r\n  1863-64,      7,529   11   10\r\n  1864-65,      7,976   17    5\r\n  1865-66,      7,884    2    8\r\n  1866-67,      7,353   16    5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL MILITARY COLLEGE AT SANDHURST.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. HISTORICAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Military College at Sandhurst was instituted in 1799, on the\r\npersistent representations of its necessity and advantages, by General\r\nLe Marchant, an eminent and distinguished officer, who met his death in\r\nactual service on the plains of Salamanca, in 1812. The report of the\r\nParliamentary Commissioners of 1855 and 1870 give the following\r\nparticulars of the history and present condition:\r\n\r\n  It commenced as a place of instruction for officers, in 1799. In 1801,\r\nthe Junior Department was organized. The united departments took the\r\nname of the Royal Military College, and his Majesty George the Third was\r\npleased by Royal Warrant to appoint a Supreme Board of Commissioners for\r\nthe purpose of managing all the affairs of the College.\r\n\r\n  An establishment and a course of study were recommended by this Board,\r\nand adopted in a Royal Warrant, passed in the same year, 1801. From this\r\ndate warrants were issued from time to time until the warrant of 1808,\r\nwhich cancels all former warrants, and still regulates the College.\r\n\r\n  By this warrant, a Board of Commissioners was appointed, consisting of\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, the Secretary at War, the Master-General of the\r\nOrdnance, the Quartermaster-General, the Adjutant-General, the Governor,\r\nand the Deputy-Governor of the College,--all for the time being. Certain\r\nother officers were added to these _ex officio_ members. In the Board so\r\nconstituted were vested the control, direction, and management of all\r\nthe affairs of the College. The College was to be under the immediate\r\ncommand of the Governor and Deputy-Governor, to be divided into a senior\r\nand junior department, each to have its own course of study, under its\r\nown staff.\r\n\r\n  A collegiate board was created to take cognizance, of all matters\r\nrelating to the interior economy of both departments. This board\r\nconsisted of the Governor, the Deputy-Governor, and three other resident\r\nmilitary authorities.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Warrant of the 27th May, 1808, for regulating all matters\r\nrelative to the Royal Military College, states the objects of the two\r\ndepartments of the College, as follows:\r\n\r\n  The Senior Department of the Royal Military College is established for\r\nthe purpose of instructing officers in the scientific parts of their\r\nprofession, with a view of enabling them the better to discharge their\r\nduty when acting in command of regiments (the situation in which they\r\ncan best recommend themselves to Us, and be entitled to hope for\r\nadvancement in the higher stations of Our service), and,\r\nat the same time, of qualifying them for being employed in the\r\nQuartermaster-General’s and Adjutant-General’s Departments.\r\n\r\n  The Junior Department of the Royal Military College is appropriated to\r\nthe instruction of those who, from early life, are intended for the\r\nmilitary profession, and who, by this means, may be grounded in science\r\npreviously to their obtaining commissions in Our army.\r\n\r\n  This department of the College is also intended to afford a provision\r\nfor the sons of meritorious officers, who have fallen or been disabled\r\nin the service of their country, and the means of education to the sons\r\nof those officers who belong to Our regular service.\r\n\r\nThe first of the departments organized was thus the Senior Department,\r\nwhich was established at High Wycombe, in 1799, although it would seem\r\nthat classes for the military instruction of officers had been in\r\nexistence previous to that year. The origin of the Senior Department is\r\nthus described in the evidence given by Sir Howard Douglas before the\r\nSelect Committee on Sandhurst:\r\n\r\n  General Jarry, who was the first Commandant of the Senior Department,\r\nwas a Frenchman, highly educated in France, who entered the service of\r\nPrussia a short time before the commencement of the Seven Years’ War,\r\nand was on the personal staff of Frederic the Second through the whole\r\nof that war. He returned to France, and became afterward one of the\r\ngenerals of the French army; and, in the year 1795, defected from the\r\nFrench army, and came to London, where he soon became very generally\r\nknown as a man of eminent talent, perfectly master of the science and\r\nthe practice of his profession, and, from his having served so long\r\nabout the person and on the staff of Frederic the Second, full of the\r\nmost interesting anecdotes and instructive details connected with that\r\nwar. General Le Marchant, having formed an acquaintance with General\r\nJarry, in London, it occurred to him that, if General Jarry could be\r\nengaged to give lectures to a certain number of young officers Who might\r\nbe disposed to go and reside where the general might attend, it would be\r\nvery advantageous to the service. General Jarry was so engaged. A house\r\nwas taken at High Wycombe; a considerable number of the rising young\r\nofficers of the day became his students,--Sir George Murray, Sir Henry\r\nBunbury, Sir Richard Bourke, General Richardson, and a great many\r\nothers. General Jarry soon found that the rudiments of military science\r\nin the British army were not sufficiently known to enable all the\r\nstudents to profit by his instruction, and recommended that\r\nmathematical, and fortification, and other classes, should be\r\nestablished; and, accordingly, Mr. Dalby, a mathematical professor, M.\r\nSt. Denis, professor of fortification, and M. Polchet, of the\r\nPolytechnic School, were engaged; and in this Way the Senior Department\r\nwas established.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jarry became commandant of the establishment on its institution,\r\nand, in 1804, Sir Howard Douglas himself was appointed to assist General\r\nJarry, as superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the Junior Department had probably been determined upon\r\nfrom the time when the Senior Department was established. It was\r\nactually organized in 1801, when it was established at Great Marlow,\r\nand, in the year 1803, consisted of 200 cadets; the Senior Department\r\nbeing, at the same time, composed of 30 students. Each department had at\r\nthis time its own commandant, superintendent, and special staff of\r\ninstructors (7 for the Senior, and 19 for the Junior Department); while\r\nthere was, in addition, a general staff, consisting of a governor,\r\nlieutenant-governor, and other officials, for the two departments,\r\nwhich, although in separate localities, together constituted the Royal\r\nMilitary College.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Warrant of 27th May, 1808, fixed the establishment on a still\r\nlarger scale, as follows:\r\n\r\n  1 Governor, 1 Lieutenant-Governor, 1 Inspector-General of Instruction.\r\n\r\n  _Senior Department._--1 Commandant, 1 Adjutant, 30 Students.\r\n\r\n  _Junior Department._--1 Commandant, 1 Major, 4 Captains of Companies,\r\n412 Gentlemen Cadets.\r\n\r\n  _Staff._--1 Chaplain and Librarian and Superintendent of Religious and\r\nClassical Instruction, 1 Agent, 1 Secretary to the Board of\r\nCommissioners, 1 Paymaster, 1 Quartermaster, 1 Surgeon, 1 Assistant\r\nSurgeon.\r\n\r\nThe number of professors is not fixed by the warrant, but, in 1810, 5\r\nwere employed at the Senior, and 32 at the Junior Department. In 1815,\r\nthe number of professors was 6 at the former, and 36 at the latter.\r\n\r\nThe establishment, with slight modifications, continued as above\r\nthroughout the period of the war which terminated in 1815; but shortly\r\nafter the conclusion of peace reductions began, in consequence of the\r\nrecommendations made in the report of the Finance Committee of 1817, and\r\nat the same time the course of instruction in the Junior Department was\r\nmade of a much less military character than it had originally been.\r\n\r\nThe Senior Department was, as has been stated, originally established at\r\nHigh Wycombe, and the Junior Department, as there was not sufficient\r\naccommodation for it at the same place, was, on its institution, placed\r\nat Great Marlow. It is probable, however, that it was intended from the\r\nfirst that the Military College should be at Sandhurst, and it appears\r\nthat, as early as 1801, the greater part of the estate at Sandhurst had\r\nbeen purchased. Owing, however, to doubts having subsequently arisen as\r\nto the eligibility of Sandhurst as a site for the college, the works\r\nthere do not appear to have been commenced until 1809; and it was\r\neventually determined that the Junior Department alone should be placed\r\nthere, the Senior Department being accommodated at Farnham. In 1812, the\r\nSenior Department went to the quarters prepared for them at the latter\r\nplace, and about the same time the Junior Department was removed to\r\nSandhurst. In 1820, in consequence of the space left vacant by the\r\nreductions which had then been made in the Junior Department, the Senior\r\nDepartment was transferred to Sandhurst; its separate military staff was\r\nat the same time abolished, the number of students at it was reduced to\r\n15, and the number of instructors to 2. It continued in this state down\r\nto the time of its conversion into the Staff College, which took place\r\nin January, 1858. The Junior Department was also, by successive\r\nreductions, brought, in 1832, to the state in which it stood in 1855, at\r\nthe time of the appointment of the Select Committee of the House of\r\nCommons, the number of cadets having been reduced to 180, divided into\r\ntwo companies. In the year 1832, also, the Parliamentary votes in aid of\r\nthe College, which, in 1815, had amounted, for the Junior Department\r\nalone, to £34,000, entirely ceased, and, from this time up to 1855, the\r\nCollege was not only self-supporting, but, in some years, actually paid\r\nmoney into the Exchequer.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1855, in consequence of attention having frequently been\r\ndrawn in Parliament to the state of Sandhurst, a Select Committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons was appointed to inquire into the condition of the\r\nRoyal Military College. The establishment of the College, was, at that\r\ntime, as follows:\r\n\r\n  1 Governor, 1 Lieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\n  _Senior Department._--2 Instructors, 15 Students.\r\n\r\n  _Junior Department._--1 Major and Superintendent of Studies, 2\r\nCaptains of Companies, 180 Gentlemen Cadets, 1 Chaplain, 1 Secretary to\r\nthe Board of Commissioners, 1 Paymaster and Quartermaster, 1 Surgeon, 1\r\nAssistant Surgeon, 1 Riding Master, 16 Instructors.\r\n\r\nThis continued without material alteration to be the establishment until\r\n1858.\r\n\r\nThe instructors undertook the following branches:\r\n\r\n  (_A._) _Senior Department._--1. Mathematics and Fortification.\r\n1. Military Surveying.\r\n\r\n  (_B._) _Junior Department._--3. Mathematics. 2. Fortification.\r\n3. Military Drawing and Surveying. 1. Landscape Drawing. 2. History,\r\nGeography, and Latin. 3. French, 2. German. [The seniors in those\r\nbranches also gave instruction to the Senior Department.]\r\n\r\nThe Chaplain also gave instruction in History.\r\n\r\nThe title of Major and Superintendent of Studies dates from the year\r\n1842. For some years previously, the offices of Adjutant, Paymaster, and\r\nSuperintendent of Studies, had been combined in the person of one\r\nofficer, Major Proctor. On his retirement, in 1842, Lieut.-Colonel\r\nProsser was appointed Major and Superintendent of Studies--an office\r\nwhich has been retained to the present day--and the appointment of\r\nAdjutant was abolished.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the inquiry by the Select Committee of the House of\r\nCommons (1855), the Junior Department of the College was a school for\r\nboys. The limits of age for admission were from 13 to 15. Candidates\r\nwere admitted by application to the Governor, on passing a qualifying\r\nexamination, before the professors of the college, in elementary\r\nsubjects of ordinary education. The maximum term of residence was four\r\nyears, the average period being three years. The course of study was\r\nintended to complete the general education of the youth, in addition to\r\ngiving him military instruction, and included history, geography, and\r\nLatin, as well as more professional subjects.\r\n\r\nThe system of instruction which prevailed at the College at that time is\r\ndescribed as follows by Mr. Twisden, now professor of mathematics at the\r\nStaff College:\r\n\r\n  The instruction and examinations in the Junior Department were, in the\r\nyear 1855, conducted on the following system: There was a division of\r\nthe department into upper and lower school; but, practically, the\r\ndivision was of little importance. The most important division was made\r\nby the line which, in each separate branch of instruction, divided the\r\ncadets in the Board class from those not in the Board class.\r\n\r\n  A cadet was in a Board class who was actually preparing for the public\r\nexamination, which took place before the “_Board_ of Commissioners for\r\nRegulating the Affairs of the Institution.” The Board was, however, in\r\nmost cases, represented by not more than one or two of its members. In\r\nany given subject, a cadet had to pass through certain grades of\r\nelementary instruction before he could be placed in a Board class.\r\nMoreover, he was only moved from one grade of elementary instruction to\r\nanother on passing examinations, which were held monthly by the senior\r\ninstructors in the several subjects. The junior instructors reported\r\nthose of their cadets whom they regarded as ready for promotion, and the\r\nsenior ascertained that the proper degree of proficiency was obtained.\r\nThus, in mathematics, a cadet had to pass examinations in Fractions and\r\nDecimals, mixed numbers, Rule of Three, Interest, and Square Root,\r\nAlgebra up to the end of Quadratic Equations, and logarithms,--four\r\nsuccessive examinations in all. He had then to spend a half year in the\r\nstudy of Euclid’s Geometry before admission to the Board class. It will\r\nbe understood that all the cadets were not examined monthly, but only\r\nsuch as were reported as fit for examination; so that any one cadet\r\nmight pass a long time without examination, or he might be examined for\r\nseveral successive grades in one subject, and not undergo any\r\nexamination in another. There was, in fact, scarcely any mutual\r\ndependence of one branch of instruction upon another. I believe the only\r\nexceptions to this were, that a cadet was required to have passed his\r\nexamination in algebra before getting into the lowest fortification\r\nclass, and to have gained a certain proficiency in military drawing\r\nbefore getting into the surveying class.\r\n\r\n  The Board class in each branch was taught by the senior instructor in\r\nthat branch, except that the Board class of history was taught by the\r\nchaplain. When a cadet had passed an examination in any subject before\r\nthe Board, he was said to have taken up a step. The steps which it was\r\npossible for him to take up were as follows, and I have arranged them in\r\nthree groups, for conveniences of reference:\r\n\r\n  A.--(1.) Euclid’s Geometry. (2.)

For gaining this\r\nhonorary distinction, the steps marked in group C were allowed to count;\r\nbut I believe not otherwise. I may mention that, in many cases, more\r\nthan six steps were taken up.\r\n\r\n  The process of examination before the Board was this: About seven\r\nweeks before the end of the half year, the senior instructor in each\r\nbranch reported the cadets in his branch whom he thought capable of\r\ntaking a step. Thus the senior instructor or professor of mathematics\r\nreported those cadets in the Euclid Board class whom he judged capable\r\nof taking up the step. Shortly after, these cadets were examined before\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor; about a week before the end of the half year,\r\nthey were examined again, on this occasion, before the Governor; lastly,\r\nthey were examined publicly before the _Board_. Failure was possible in\r\neither of these examinations, and not unfrequently occurred at the\r\npreliminary examinations, and sometimes, though rarely, at the Board\r\nexamination. The effect of failure was, that the cadet could not pass\r\nhis step without going through his examinations at the end of the next\r\nhalf year.\r\n\r\n  The examinations were conducted entirely _vivâ voce_. The Governor’s\r\nand Lieutenant-Governor’s examinations were searching; they sometimes\r\nlasted from six to seven hours; but, of course, the cadets, severally,\r\nwere under examination only during a part of that time. The Board\r\nexamination, though less searching, was a real examination. A cadet\r\nunder examination had not the least notion of what was going to be\r\nasked, except that it was fairly within the subject of the step.\r\n\r\n  The system thus briefly described was invented by Major Proctor, who\r\nwas at first _Adjutant_ and, afterward, Superintendent of Studies. It\r\nwas in operation, at all events, as early as the year 1818. It was open\r\nto several objections; but it possessed this capital advantage, that it\r\nwas calculated to bring, and, in point of fact, brought a large majority\r\nof the cadets up to a certain moderately high standard of proficiency.\r\nThe instructors were under no temptation to take great pains with a few\r\nclever boys, and to neglect the rest; they were nearly sure to assist\r\nevery cadet showing the least inclination to work, and to assist those\r\nmost who were in need of assistance.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, the system failed to supply a cadet of superior\r\nability with a motive to attain a high degree of proficiency in any\r\ngiven subject. The utmost attained was, that cadets of more than\r\nordinary ability were encouraged to attain the standard of proficiency\r\nin more than the necessary six subjects. The system was also open to the\r\nserious objection that, under it, the cleverest cadets got through their\r\ncourse quickly. This was bad for them, for it had the effect of bringing\r\ntheir school-education to an early end; and it was bad for the\r\ninstitution, because the eldest cadets were not the most intelligent.\r\n\r\n  I must be allowed to add, that my experience of the examinations by\r\n_vivâ voce_ has given me a very lively sense of the value of that kind\r\nof examination; and, though it is not adapted for all subjects, and,\r\nwhere many have to be examined, takes too much time, yet it might be\r\nused under many circumstances with very great advantage, and I regard\r\nits total disuse since the year 1858 as a very serious error.\r\n\r\n  I have mentioned above the fact of the Junior Department being divided\r\ninto an under and upper school. I may add that there were six\r\nclasses,--three in each school, and two removes in each class. I believe\r\nthat this was the remains of an earlier organization, which, without\r\nbeing formally abrogated, was, by degrees, nearly obliterated by the\r\nintroduction of the step system. The only thing that kept up the\r\ndistinction between upper and lower school was, that a cadet, to be in a\r\nBoard class, had to pass into upper school. The three classes in the\r\nupper school did not have a nominal existence in 1851.\r\n\r\n  With respect to the Senior Department, a somewhat different system was\r\nfollowed. The course was one of two years; but, in the case of officers\r\nwho had been cadets, the course was one of a year and a half. There was\r\nan examination held at the end of each half year on the subject of the\r\nhalf year’s course. The method of examination resembled that in use in\r\nthe Junior Department. The subjects comprised in the course are\r\nmentioned in a paper printed on page 215 of the evidence taken before\r\nthe Select Committee of the House of Commons on Sandhurst (1855).\r\n\r\n  In certain respects, officers might do more than the prescribed\r\ncourse, and obtain honorary mention, _e.g._, they might do extra plans;\r\nthey might take up a certain amount of analytical mathematics, with a\r\nportion of Poisson’s “Traité de Mécanique,” and of Laplace’s “Mécanique\r\nCéleste.” I have by me the synopsis of the ordinary course of\r\nmathematics in use before the year 1858; but, as the heads of it are\r\ngiven in the paper above referred to, it is unnecessary to give any\r\ndetails about it.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Select Committee of 1855 contained various suggestions\r\nfor the improvement of both departments of the College, but did not\r\npropose to alter the character of the Junior Department as a place of\r\njuvenile education. The only practical results of the report were, the\r\nestablishment of Queen’s cadetships, and the revision of the rates of\r\npayment required from all classes of cadets. The institution of Queen’s\r\ncadetships was determined upon by the Government in 1856, but the other\r\nalteration was not immediately carried out, and no modification of\r\nimportance in the constitution of the College ensued from the\r\nrecommendations of the Committee. It was not until the general\r\nreorganization of the system of military education which took place in\r\n1857 that any important change was made in regard to the Military\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been decided at the end of 1856 by Lord Panmure, then\r\nSecretary of State for War, that an amalgamation of the Junior\r\nDepartment of Sandhurst with the lower classes of Woolwich should be\r\neffected. The Council of Military Education, on their appointment, in\r\nApril, 1857, were directed to suggest the mode in which this\r\namalgamation could be carried out, taking, as their starting point, the\r\nprinciple that Sandhurst was to be converted from a school for boys into\r\na college for young men, with the age of admission ranging from 16 to\r\n18.\r\n\r\nThe proposed plan having been approved, an announcement was made, in\r\nDecember, 1857, that the education of candidates for all arms of the\r\nservice, who did not obtain commissions by direct appointments, would be\r\ngiven at Sandhurst; that entrance would be obtained by competitive\r\nexamination, open to candidates between the ages of 16 and 18; that the\r\nperiod of study would be two years, and would be terminated by a\r\ncompetitive examination, the most successful candidates in which would\r\nbe permitted to select the Engineers or Artillery, according to the\r\nnumber of vacancies in those corps, or would receive commissions without\r\npurchase in the Cavalry, Guards, or Line. Those who selected the\r\nOrdnance corps were to be removed to the school of application at\r\nWoolwich.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with this notification, appeared a General Order,\r\nannouncing the conversion of the Senior Department into the Staff\r\nCollege, which was then placed under a separate commandant and staff of\r\ninstructors,--the Junior Department being henceforward called the Cadet\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nAn examination for admission to Sandhurst, under the regulations\r\ndescribed above, took place in January, 1858, when 24 candidates were\r\nadmitted to the College. On the 26th of April, however, a resolution was\r\npassed by the House of Commons, on the motion of Mr. Monsell, in\r\nconsequence of which the plan for the amalgamation of Woolwich and\r\nSandhurst was necessarily abandoned; and, in May, 1858, revised\r\nregulations were issued, which again placed Sandhurst on the footing of\r\nan entirely distinct establishment from Woolwich. In these regulations,\r\nhowever, a new provision was introduced, by which a cadet at the\r\nMilitary College was, if otherwise eligible, permitted to compete at the\r\nexamination for admission to Woolwich, without his position at Sandhurst\r\nbeing affected by failure in this examination. This regulation has been\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nThe large increase in the numbers of the College which was contemplated\r\nby the amalgamation scheme was not carried out, the establishment still\r\nremaining at 180 cadets, divided into two companies. At the same time,\r\nthe other alterations recommended by the Council in the constitution and\r\ncourse of study of the College were brought into effect. Since this\r\nperiod the system of juvenile military instruction, which had been\r\nalready abandoned at Woolwich, has been discontinued at Sandhurst. The\r\nestablishment was converted from a school for boys into a college for\r\nyoung men, the minimum age for admission being placed at 16; while the\r\ncourse of instruction--the length of which was fixed at two years--was\r\nmade almost entirely professional. The principle of competition was\r\nadopted as the condition of admission, although not to so full an extent\r\nas at Woolwich, the candidate for Sandhurst being required to apply to\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, in order to have his name entered on the list of\r\ncompetitors. The entrance examinations for admission to the College, and\r\nthe final examinations for commissions, were placed under the control of\r\nthe Council of Military Education; and the whole method of instruction\r\nwas revised, the old system of “steps” being abandoned.\r\n\r\nFor many years, up to this time, the College had been almost entirely\r\nself-supporting. The orphan-class of cadets, established by the Royal\r\nWarrant of 1808, who had received a gratuitous education, had, after\r\nsuccessive reductions, been finally abolished in 1822; and, though the\r\nsons of officers were still educated at reduced rates, the system had\r\nbeen gradually introduced of affording them this advantage without\r\nexpense to the public, by increasing the rates paid by the sons of\r\nprivate gentlemen. This system, which had been animadverted on by the\r\nSelect Committee of the House of Commons, in 1855, was altered on the\r\nreorganization of the College, in 1858; the rates of payment from all\r\nclasses were reduced, and the principle was, at least partially,\r\nadopted, of defraying, by a Parliamentary vote, the difference between\r\nthe actual cost of the education of a cadet and the lower rates charged\r\nfor the sons of officers. The first public announcement of the\r\ninstitution of Queen’s cadetships, the holders of which were to receive\r\na gratuitous education, was also made in 1858. Since this period, a\r\nlarge part of the expense of the College has been borne by the public.\r\n\r\nSome addition to the instructional staff was made in the year 1858, in\r\nconsequence of the general changes introduced at that time in the system\r\nand subjects of instruction; and, in the same year, the office of\r\nAdjutant--which had been abolished in the year 1842--was revived, in\r\nconsequence of the strong representations of the Governor, Lt.-Gen. Sir\r\nH. D. Jones.\r\n\r\nThe next important change in the organization of the College was in\r\n1862. After the abandonment of the scheme for the amalgamation of\r\nWoolwich and Sandhurst, the Council of Military Education turned their\r\nattention to the subject of enlarging the latter establishment, with the\r\nview of making it a general military college, through which all\r\ncandidates for commissions in any branch of the service, except the\r\nArtillery and Engineers, should be required to pass. The general outline\r\nof a scheme having this object in view was submitted by the Council as\r\nearly as July, 1858, to General Peel, then Secretary of State for War.\r\nIt was still under consideration when General Peel left office, in the\r\nsummer of 1859, and was again brought under the notice of his successor,\r\nLord Herbert, in August of that year.\r\n\r\nAfter some consideration, the general principle of the scheme was\r\nsanctioned by Lord Herbert, in December, 1859; but no immediate steps\r\nwere taken for carrying the plan into operation. At the end of 1860,\r\nhowever, the Council were directed to draw up a detailed scheme of\r\norganization for the College, on the assumption that all candidates for\r\ncommissions in the Cavalry, Guards, and Infantry, would be required to\r\npass through a year’s course of instruction there; a vote was also\r\nincluded in the estimates of 1861 for commencing the enlargement of the\r\nbuildings, with the ultimate object of providing accommodation for 600\r\ncadets. The details of the scheme were, after some correspondence, fully\r\nmatured, and were on the point of being submitted to Her Majesty for\r\napproval, with the view of the new system coming into effect on the 1st\r\nof January, 1862. The plan, however, met with very great opposition,\r\nboth in the House of Commons and from the authorities of the\r\nuniversities, who regarded it as necessarily leading to the exclusion of\r\nuniversity men from the army. In consequence of this opposition, the\r\nUnder-Secretary of State for War, toward the end of the session of 1861,\r\nannounced, in the House of Commons, that the new system should not come\r\ninto operation until Parliament had had a further opportunity of\r\nexpressing their opinion upon it. The original plan was also so far\r\nmodified that the extension of the College was limited to providing\r\naccommodation first for 500, and then for 400 cadets, in the first\r\ninstance; but the abolition of appointments to direct commissions, and\r\nthe system of passing all candidates for commissions in the Line through\r\nthe College, were still contemplated, though the commencement of the\r\nsystem was deferred until the 1st July, 1862.\r\n\r\nThe question was in this state at the time of the death of Lord Herbert,\r\nin August, 1861. Sir George Lewis, who succeeded him as Secretary of\r\nState for War, having, during the recess, reconsidered the question,\r\nannounced, shortly after the commencement of the session of 1862, that\r\nit had been determined to abandon the idea of requiring all candidates\r\nfor commissions in the Line to pass through the College, and that the\r\nsystem of appointments to direct commissions by purchase would be\r\nmaintained. At the same time, it was proposed that _non-purchase_\r\ncommissions should in future only be obtained by passing through\r\nSandhurst, and that an enlargement of the College to 336 cadets should\r\ntake place, to provide for the increased number of non-purchase\r\ncommissions caused by the amalgamation of the Indian with the Imperial\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nEven in this modified form, the plan for the extension of the College\r\nappears to have been viewed with considerable jealousy by the House of\r\nCommons. A vote adverse to it was actually at first carried; but the\r\nquestion having, in consequence of the representations of Sir George\r\nLewis, been reconsidered, the plan proposed by the Government was at\r\nlength agreed to. Regulations for the College on the new footing were\r\nissued on the 1st May, 1862. These regulations form the basis of the\r\npresent system of the College.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important changes made at this time was the great\r\nincrease in the number of free commissions placed at the disposal of the\r\nCollege. Under the old system which existed prior to 1858, while the\r\ninstitution was still a mere place of juvenile education, all cadets who\r\npassed in the six “steps,” to which allusion has been made, received\r\nfree commissions; but there was, strictly speaking, no competition for\r\nsuch commissions. After the alteration in the age of admission to the\r\nCollege, and the general revision of the course of instruction which\r\ntook place in 1858, a limited number of free commissions were bestowed\r\nupon those cadets who stood highest in the final examination. A large\r\nnumber of these appointments, however, still remained in the gift of the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, and were granted to candidates who passed the\r\nordinary examination for direct commissions. Since 1862, all\r\nnon-purchase commissions have been reserved for cadets at the Royal\r\nMilitary College, with the exception of a small number (not exceeding on\r\nan average 12 annually) bestowed upon non-commissioned officers promoted\r\nfrom the ranks, and upon gentlemen who have held the appointment of page\r\nto Her Majesty. The commissions given to the latter are exclusively in\r\nthe Foot Guards, and their number seldom exceeds one in each year. The\r\nfree commissions allotted to the College are thrown open to competition\r\namong the cadets, with the exception of those reserved for Queen’s and\r\nIndian cadets. Both of these classes of cadets have, since the\r\ninstitution of Indian cadetships, which took place simultaneously with\r\nthe change of the College system, in August, 1862, been entitled to\r\nreceive free commissions on passing a qualifying examination at the end\r\nof their term of residence.\r\n\r\nThe course of study at the College was, at the same time, considerably\r\nmodified, with the view of allowing its completion, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, in one year, instead of two years, as formerly,--the\r\nmaximum term of residence being fixed at a year and a half. An attempt\r\nwas also made to render the course more strictly professional, and\r\nbetter adapted to qualify a young officer for the performance of\r\nordinary regimental duties immediately on joining his corps, by the\r\nintroduction of instruction in military law, interior economy, etc.\r\n\r\nThe age of admission was fixed at 16 to 20 for candidates for the\r\nInfantry, and 16 to 22 for those for the Cavalry,--an extension of a\r\nyear in these limits being for the first time introduced in favor of\r\nstudents at the universities. A further privilege held out to the latter\r\nclass of candidates was that, while others could only obtain admission\r\nby competitive examination, the fact of having passed certain university\r\nexaminations was of itself made a qualification for admission. These\r\nconcessions, which, at first, were made to the Universities of Oxford,\r\nCambridge, and Dublin, have been since extended to the other\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nThe number of cadets was never raised to the extent contemplated in the\r\nplan proposed by Sir George Lewis. It was originally intended that the\r\nCollege should accommodate 336 cadets, divided into four companies of 84\r\neach; but the establishment was ultimately fixed at 250. This increase,\r\nhowever (the numbers having, previously to 1862, been 180), led to the\r\naddition, in August, 1862, of a third company to the two in which the\r\ncadets had been previously divided. An additional captain was appointed\r\nto command this company, and, at the same time, three subaltern officers\r\n(one to each company) were, for the first time, added to the strength of\r\nthe establishment, to assist the captains in the charge of the\r\ncompanies. Simultaneously with this, an important alteration was made in\r\nthe discipline of the College, by abolishing the system which had\r\nhitherto prevailed of employing the sergeants to assist in maintaining\r\ndiscipline by reporting the cadets for offences committed against the\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the establishment also necessitated in this year an\r\naugmentation of the staff of instructors.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Royal Military College in 1863, after the\r\nchange of system had come into effect, was as follows:\r\n\r\n  _General Staff._--1 Governor, 1 Chaplain, 1 Paymaster, 1\r\nQuartermaster, 1 Surgeon, 1 Assistant-Surgeon, 1 Riding Master.\r\n\r\n  _Staff College._--1 Commandant, 1 Adjutant, 9 Professors, 30 Students.\r\n\r\n  _Cadet College._--1 Lieutenant-Governor, 1 Major and Superintendent of\r\nStudies, 3 Captains of Companies, 3 Subalterns, 250 Gentlemen Cadets, 1\r\nAdjutant, 40 Professors and Instructors, of whom two were employed also\r\nat the Staff College.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the College has undergone no material alteration\r\nsince 1863, with the exception of the abolition of the office of\r\nLieutenant-Governor, and the substitution for it of that of Commandant\r\nof the Cadet College. The change, though decided upon in 1862, was not\r\ncarried out during the tenure of office of the officer who, at that\r\ntime, held the appointment of Lieutenant-Governor, and did not actually\r\ntake effect until 1864. The Lieutenant-Governor, though nominally the\r\ndeputy of the Governor, had exercised no control over the Commandant of\r\nthe Staff College from the time of the institution of the latter\r\nestablishment, in 1858. His functions were limited to the Cadet College,\r\nof which he was virtually, though not nominally, the Commandant.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of cadets was raised in 1865 to 300, and some slight\r\nalterations have, at various times, been made in the number of\r\nprofessors and instructors; but, in its general character, the\r\nestablishment at the present time remains as it was in 1863.\r\n\r\nThe modifications which have since been made consist chiefly in the\r\nreduction of the higher limit of age for admission to 19 for all\r\nbranches of the service (retaining, however, the former exception in\r\nfavor of students from the universities); the discontinuance of the\r\nstudy of military law, etc.; and the extension of the ordinary course of\r\nresidence from one year to a year and a half.\r\n\r\nIn regard to discipline, the system of assigning marks for good conduct,\r\nwhich was introduced by the regulations of 1862, has been discontinued,\r\nowing to practical difficulties which were found to occur in carrying\r\nout the system with uniformity. At the beginning of 1868, an alteration\r\nwas introduced in the powers of the professorial staff with regard to\r\nthe maintenance of discipline. Previously to this period they had\r\nexercised no disciplinary powers; they have since been required to take\r\nnotice of all offences which come within their cognizance, either in or\r\nout of study, and have been empowered to place a cadet in arrest pending\r\nan inquiry into the offence. Even at the present time, however, the\r\nprofessors have no power of punishment, this power being confined to the\r\nmilitary staff of the College.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Royal Warrant of 1808, the four companies of cadets\r\nwere placed upon the establishment of the army, and every one admitted\r\nto the College received a warrant of gentleman cadet, with the daily pay\r\nof 2_s._ 6_d._ Down to the year 1857, the regulations for admission to\r\nthe College contained the provision that, “in conformity to the Royal\r\nWarrant, dated the 27th of May, 1808, all gentlemen cadets at the Royal\r\nMilitary College are subject to the Articles of War.” This provision\r\nappears to have been omitted from all regulations published on the\r\nrecommendation of the Council of Military Education since the\r\nreorganization of the College, which took place at the beginning of\r\n1858. At the present time, a cadet, on admission, is required to sign a\r\ndeclaration “to conform, in every respect, to Her Majesty’s Regulations,\r\nand to the rules and discipline of the service.”\r\n\r\nThe Board of Commissioners, at the time of the report of the Select\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons, in 1855, still continued to\r\nadminister all the affairs of the Royal Military College, in virtue of\r\nthe wide powers vested in them by the Royal Warrant of 1808. For some\r\nyears previously to this, however, the War Office had exercised\r\nconsiderable control over the financial acts of the Board. On the\r\nappointment of the Council of Military Education, in 1857, the latter\r\nbody began to superintend the course of instruction at the College,\r\ntheir attention having been directed to this subject in the first\r\ninstructions issued to them on their appointment. At the beginning of\r\n1858, they commenced to conduct the examinations for admission,\r\nand, by a Royal Warrant of the 1st October, 1858, they were formally\r\nappointed Visitors of the College, and required to report to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief upon the instruction given at it. The power of\r\nrecommending either the appointment or removal of the professors and\r\ninstructors was, by the same warrant, placed in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe original warrant of 1808 has never been cancelled, and the powers\r\nvested by it in the Board of Commissioners still, therefore, nominally\r\nremain in force, except so far as by the warrant of 1858. Since this\r\ntime, however, the connection of the Commissioners with the management\r\nof the College has been gradually diminished. In 1863, the office of\r\nSecretary to the Board was abolished, his financial duties being\r\ntransferred to the Paymaster of the College, and the performance of his\r\nother duties being provided for in the Commander-in-Chief’s office. The\r\ndiscipline of the College still remains nominally under the\r\nsuperintendence of the Commissioners; but, even in regard to this point,\r\ntheir interference, except when questions of considerable importance\r\nhave arisen, appears to have been little called for. Their duties of\r\nlate years seem to have been principally confined to business connected\r\nwith the management of the College property, in regard to which,\r\nalthough the estate is now formally vested in the Secretary of State for\r\nWar, the former powers of the Commissioners are reserved.\r\n\r\nThe attendance in the College, since its reorganization, has been as\r\nfollows, viz.:\r\n\r\n  1855    180\r\n  1862    250\r\n  1865    300\r\n\r\n  _Staff of Government and Instruction_, 1871-2.\r\n\r\n  _President._--Duke of Cambridge, Field Marshal.\r\n  _Vice-President._--Rt.

At the time\r\nthe Committee reported (in the year 1855) the age of admission to\r\nSandhurst was from 13 to 15; in the following year, however, at the time\r\nthe recommendations of the Committee were adopted by the Government, it\r\nwas in contemplation to raise the minimum age for admission to the\r\nCollege to 16; and it was consequently decided that, in order to meet\r\nthe case of those who under the former regulations would have been\r\nadmitted as Queen’s cadets at a younger age, a special allowance of\r\n40_l._ a year might, at the discretion of the Secretary of State, be\r\ngranted to a candidate qualified for a Queen’s cadetship, at the age of\r\n13, to assist him in his preparatory education, until he attained the\r\nage at which he would be eligible for admission to the College. This\r\narrangement was sanctioned by the Treasury in 1856, and at first the\r\nresults of the recommendations of the Select Committee seem to have been\r\nconfined to granting candidates the special allowance in aid of their\r\npreparatory education, as no cadet entered until 1860.\r\n\r\nThe first public announcement of the institution of Queen’s cadetships,\r\nand of the regulations under which they were to be granted, was made by\r\na General Order, dated Horse Guards, 5th January, 1858. It had by this\r\ntime been finally determined to fix the ordinary minimum age for\r\nadmission to Sandhurst at 16; but an exception was made in favor of the\r\nQueen’s cadets, who were to be admitted one year younger,--at the age of\r\n15. The following were among the regulations:\r\n\r\n  These cadetships, of which there are twenty in all, are confined to\r\nthe sons of officers of the army, Royal navy, and Royal marines, who\r\nhave fallen in action, or have died of wounds received in action, or of\r\ndiseases contracted on active service, and who have left their families\r\nin reduced circumstances.\r\n\r\n  Gentlemen cadets on this class are educated gratuitously.\r\n\r\n  The nominations, with the concurrence of the Secretary of State for\r\nWar, are made by the Commander-in-Chief for the army, in the proportion\r\nof 15 cadetships, and by the First Lord of the Admiralty for the navy\r\nand marines, in that of five cadetships,--to whom applications are to be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n  No candidate can be admitted under the age of 15, nor above that of\r\n17.\r\n\r\n  In a case where the services of the father and the circumstances of\r\nthe family are deemed such as to constitute a claim, a candidate\r\nineligible for immediate admission, on account of his not having\r\nattained the proper age, but being a promising youth, may, at the\r\ndiscretion of the Secretary of State for War, be allowed an addition to\r\nthe compassionate allowance, with the especial view of promoting his\r\neducation, until he is eligible for admission.\r\n\r\nThe regulations under which Queen’s cadets are at present nominated are\r\nsimilar to the above, with the exception that the wording of the phrase\r\n“diseases contracted on _active service_” has been altered to “diseases\r\ncontracted on _service abroad_,” and that Queen’s cadets, like other\r\ncandidates, are not now admitted until the age of 16. An addition to the\r\n“Compassionate Allowance,” not exceeding 40_l._ a year, may at the same\r\ntime be granted to a candidate after the age of 13, in order to assist\r\nhim in his education until he becomes eligible for admission to the\r\nCollege. The number of Queen’s cadetships (20) includes both those who\r\nhave entered, and those to whom the educational allowance is granted\r\npreviously to their admission.\r\n\r\nFrom the first institution of Queen’s cadetships, the candidates\r\nnominated to them have been admitted to the College on passing a\r\nqualifying examination, and have received a gratuitous education; they\r\nwere, however, originally required to compete for commissions without\r\npurchase, with other candidates, at the end of the College course. The\r\nprivilege of obtaining a free commission on passing merely a qualifying\r\nexamination was not extended to them until the institution of the Indian\r\ncadetships in 1862. As it was found necessary to exempt the Indian\r\ncadets from competition with other candidates for commissions without\r\npurchase, a similar privilege was extended to the Queen’s cadets. Both\r\nclasses of cadets, in addition to their free education and maintenance,\r\nreceive clothing and pocket money.\r\n\r\nThe institution of Indian cadetships at Sandhurst took place in\r\nconsequence of the transfer of the government of India from the East\r\nIndia Company to the Crown, and the subsequent amalgamation of the\r\nIndian and Imperial forces.\r\n\r\nThe notice of the admission of Indian cadets to the establishment\r\nappears for the first time in the College regulations of 1st May, 1862.\r\nTheir number, like that of the Queen’s cadets, is limited to 20. They\r\nare nominated, under the provisions of Acts 21 & 22 Vict. cap. 106, s.\r\n35, and 23 & 24 Vict. cap. 100, by the Secretary of State for India in\r\nCouncil, from the sons “of persons who have served in India in the\r\nmilitary or civil services of Her Majesty or the East India Company.”\r\nThe restrictions, however, regarding the death of the father and the\r\ncircumstances of the family, which apply to a candidate for a Queen’s\r\ncadetship, do not limit the nomination of Indian cadets. The expense of\r\nthe education and maintenance of the latter is borne by Indian revenues.\r\n\r\n\r\n  REGULATIONS FOR ADMISSION, CLOTHING, BOOKS, PAYMENTS, ETC., 1867.\r\n\r\n  1. Candidates for vacancies at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst,\r\nwill be required to undergo an examination under the superintendence of\r\nthe Council of Military Education. Examinations for this purpose will be\r\nheld in June and December of each year, at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea.\r\n\r\n  2. Twenty Queen’s cadets will be borne on the establishment, being the\r\nsons of officers who have fallen in action, or have died of wounds\r\nreceived in action, or of diseases contracted on service abroad; and who\r\nhave left their families in reduced circumstances. Fifteen will be sons\r\nof officers of the army, and five will be sons of officers of the Royal\r\nNavy and Royal Marines.\r\n\r\n  There will be, in addition, twenty Indian cadetships, for nomination\r\nto which the sons of persons will be selected who have served in India\r\nin the military or civil services of Her Majesty, or of the East India\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n  3. Candidates, whether for the infantry or the cavalry, must be\r\nbetween 16 and 19 years of age at the commencement of the term\r\nimmediately succeeding their admission examination.\r\n\r\n  Terms commence on the 1st February and 1st August.\r\n\r\n  Students from the Universities will be admissible at the ages stated\r\nin Art. 11 of these regulations.\r\n\r\n  4. Every candidate for admission must apply (if under age, through his\r\nparent or guardian) to the Commander-in-Chief, to have his name entered\r\non the list of candidates.\r\n\r\n  5. He must transmit with his application the following documents,\r\nviz.: (_a_) An extract from the register of his baptism, or, in default\r\nof that, a declaration before a magistrate, made by one of his parents,\r\ngiving his exact age. (_b_) A certificate, from the minister of the\r\nChurch or denomination to which he belongs, of his having been duly\r\ninstructed in the principles of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\n  6. His name having been placed upon the list of candidates, it will be\r\nopen to him to offer himself at any of the half-yearly examinations\r\nwhich may occur while he is within the prescribed limits of age. If\r\nunsuccessful in obtaining one of the vacancies at the college, he will\r\nbe allowed to present himself at any subsequent examination until he has\r\nexceeded the maximum age. After he has exceeded the maximum age, he can\r\nonly be admitted into the army on obtaining a direct commission by\r\npurchase, in the usual manner, after passing a qualifying examination.\r\n\r\n  7. He will be examined by a medical officer, who will ascertain\r\nwhether he is free from all bodily and organic defects, and whether, as\r\nfar as regards physical constitution, he is in every point of view fit\r\nfor military service.\r\n\r\n  8. The following will be the subjects of examination, but no candidate\r\nwill be allowed to be examined in more than _five_ of these subjects:\r\n\r\n                                                              Marks.\r\n    Classics: Latin, 2,000; Greek, 1,600,                     3,600\r\n    Mathematics,                                              3,600\r\n    English language,                                         1,200\r\n    Modern languages, each,                                   1,200\r\n    History, with geography,                                  1,200\r\n    Natural sciences (_i.e._, mineralogy and geology),   1,200\r\n    Experimental sciences (chemistry, heat, and electricity), 1,200\r\n    Geometrical drawing                                         600\r\n    Free-hand drawing                                           600\r\n\r\n  Of the above subjects, the elementary portions of mathematics and the\r\nEnglish language are obligatory on each candidate.\r\n\r\n  The following elementary branches will be included in the obligatory\r\nsection of mathematics, viz.:\r\n\r\n  In arithmetic: vulgar and decimal fractions, proportion, extraction of\r\nthe square root, and interest.\r\n\r\n  In algebra: fractions, simple equations, and questions producing them.\r\n\r\n  In Euclid: the first three books.\r\n\r\n  To these elementary branches 1,200 marks (out of the whole 3,600 for\r\nmathematics) will be allotted, and it will be necessary for\r\nqualification that at least 400 be obtained, of which 200 must be\r\nobtained in arithmetic.\r\n\r\n  In the English language 400 marks will be allotted to correct and\r\nlegible writing from dictation, and to composition; and of these it will\r\nbe necessary for qualification that 200 be obtained.\r\n\r\n  Out of the remaining subjects the candidate may select any three.\r\n\r\n  No candidate will be allowed to count the marks gained in any of the\r\nthree voluntary subjects, unless amounting to one sixth of the whole\r\nnumber of marks allotted to that subject; and for qualification he will\r\nbe required to obtain on his five subjects a total of 1,500 marks.\r\n\r\n  No marks will be allowed to count in any subject left optional to the\r\ncandidate, unless he gain at least one sixth of the whole number\r\nallotted to that subject.\r\n\r\n  9. Every candidate will be required to forward to the Military\r\nSecretary, Horse Guards, one month before the examination, a statement\r\nof the subjects he desires to take up, as well as a certificate from the\r\nmaster or tutor under whom he has been educated, of his general moral\r\nconduct for at least the two preceding years. If a candidate has failed\r\nin a previous examination he will only be required to forward a list of\r\nthe subjects he selects, and a certificate of conduct between the two\r\nexaminations. These documents are under no circumstances to be\r\ntransmitted before the date above specified.\r\n\r\n  10. After the examination the candidates will be reported to the\r\nCommander-in-Chief in the order of their merit, and will be appointed\r\naccordingly as far as vacancies will allow.\r\n\r\n  11. Candidates who have passed the examinations called “responsions”\r\nand “moderations” at the University of Oxford, or those called “previous\r\nexaminations” at the Universities of Cambridge and Dublin, or the\r\nmatriculation examination of the University of London; or any one of the\r\nthree examinations required for the degree of M.A. at the Universities\r\nof St. Andrew’s and Glasgow; or the “class examination of the second\r\nyear” (Curriculum of Arts) at the University of Aberdeen; or the\r\n“preliminary examination” at the University of Edinburgh; or the “first\r\nUniversity examination” of Queen’s University, Ireland, will be\r\nconsidered as qualified for admission to the Royal Military College\r\nwithout further examination.\r\n\r\n  Candidates from the Universities must not be more than 21 years of age\r\nfor the infantry, nor more than 23 years for the cavalry. They will be\r\nrequired to send to the Military Secretary, Horse Guards, two months\r\nbefore the commencement of the term at which they desire to enter,\r\ncertificates from the responsible authorities of their college of\r\ngeneral moral conduct during residence at the University, and of having\r\npassed the above-mentioned examinations, together with the certificate\r\nof age, as required by clause 5\r\n\r\n  Should the number of general candidates be considerably in excess of\r\nthe number of vacancies at the college, a suitable portion of those\r\nvacancies will be offered to the University and to the competing\r\ncandidates respectively.\r\n\r\n  12. Candidates for admission as Queen’s cadets must apply for a\r\nnomination to the Commander-in-Chief, if the sons of officers in the\r\narmy; or to the First Lord of the Admirality, if the sons of officers in\r\nthe Royal navy, or Royal marines. The above nominations will be made by\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief or First Lord of the Admiralty, with the\r\nconcurrence of the Secretary of State for War. The Secretary of State\r\nfor India in Council will nominate to cadetships for the Indian\r\nservices.\r\n\r\n  _Provision of Necessaries, Books, Contributions, etc._\r\n\r\n  13. Every gentleman cadet will receive from the Military Secretary a\r\nlist of the articles of clothing, books, and instruments with which he\r\nmust provide himself before joining the college, and which he will be\r\nrequired to keep complete during his residence.\r\n\r\n  Any other books, instruments, or drawing implements that he may\r\nsubsequently require for the prosecution of his studies, will be\r\nprovided at the college, and charged to his account.\r\n\r\n  14. The amount of contribution for education, board, washing, and\r\nmedical attendance, on account of each cadet, per annum, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    _a._ For sons of private gentlemen,                        £100\r\n    _b._ For sons of admirals, and general officers having\r\n                regiments or receiving Indian colonels’ allowances,   80\r\n    _c._ For sons of general officers,                           70\r\n    _d._ For sons of captains and commanders of the Royal\r\n                navy, and field officers of the army having\r\n                substantive rank,                                     50\r\n    _e._ For sons of all officers of the royal navy and army\r\n                under the above rank,                                 40\r\n    _f._ For sons of officers of the royal navy and army who\r\n                have died in the service, and whose families are\r\n                proved to be left in pecuniary distress,              20\r\n    _g._ Queen’s cadets and cadets nominated by the Secretary\r\n    of State for India in Council,                                 Free.\r\n\r\n  15. General officers on the non-effective list will pay according to\r\ntheir last substantive rank.\r\n\r\n  Officers who have sold their commissions are, in this classification,\r\nreckoned as private gentlemen.\r\n\r\n  The cases of officers who have retired voluntarily upon half-pay\r\nprevious to having served twenty-five years on full pay will be\r\nspecially considered.\r\n\r\n  Officers who retire on half-pay after twenty-five years’ service on\r\nfull pay will be classified for payment with the rank in which they last\r\nserved.\r\n\r\n  16. The orphans of officers whose claims do not come under classes\r\n_f_, and _g_, must contribute according to the substantive rank last\r\nheld by their fathers.\r\n\r\n  17. For sons of officers who have retired on _full_ pay, the payments\r\nwill be according to the substantive rank last held by their fathers.\r\n\r\n  18. The sons of officers of civil departments having relative rank\r\nwith officers of the army and navy, of the permanent militia staff, and\r\nof adjutants of the volunteer force, are admissible to the college on\r\nthe same terms as those prescribed for the sons of army and navy\r\nofficers of corresponding rank.\r\n\r\n  19. The sons of Indian naval and military officers not specially\r\nnominated by the Secretary of State for India will be admitted on the\r\nsame terms as the sons of officers of the Queen’s service.\r\n\r\n  20. Contributions for the sons of professors at the Staff and Cadet\r\nColleges, at the Royal Military Academy, and at the late Indian\r\nColleges, Addiscombe, will be    £50\r\n\r\n  For the sons of masters at the above institutions,    40\r\n\r\n  21. Any change which may take place by promotion or retirement in the\r\nrank of the father of a cadet must be immediately notified to the\r\nMilitary Secretary, in order that the contribution paid to the college\r\non account of such cadet may be regulated accordingly.\r\n\r\n  22. _Previously_ to the admission of a cadet (not a Queen’s cadet) he,\r\nor if a minor, his parent or guardian, will be required to make the\r\nfollowing payments, viz.:\r\n\r\n    1. His contribution for half a year.\r\n    2. The sum of 15_l._ for his first equipment of uniform clothing.\r\n    3. The sum of 10_s._ for the support of the company reading-rooms.\r\n    4. A deposit of 15_l._ on account, for contingent expenses.\r\n\r\n  23. The above sums are to be paid to the paymaster of the College.\r\n\r\n  24. For each succeeding half year the regulated contribution is in\r\nlike manner to be paid in advance, to the paymaster of the college, to\r\nwhom must also be remitted the sum of 5_l._ for the further provision of\r\nuniform clothing, and such sum as may be required to make up the\r\ncontingent deposit to 15_l._ The amount of this balance will be shown by\r\nan account, rendered at the end of every half year, of the sums paid out\r\nof the deposit during the past term.\r\n\r\n  25. No cadet on whose behalf these regulations in regard to payments\r\nhave not been complied with, will be received at the college.\r\n\r\n  26. No refund of contribution will be made for any portion of the half\r\nyear in which the cadet may be removed from the establishment, without\r\nthe special sanction of the Secretary of State for War.\r\n\r\n  27. No payments will be required from Queen’s or Indian cadets.\r\n\r\n  28. If a cadet be rusticated during a term, his contribution for the\r\nhalf year will be forfeited.\r\n\r\n  29. If absent a whole term in consequence of rustication or sickness,\r\na contribution of 10_l._ will be required for the privilege of his name\r\nbeing kept on the rolls of the establishment, and for a vacancy being\r\nguaranteed at the commencement of the next term.\r\n\r\n  30. If absent from sickness during any portion of a term, a refund of\r\nthat portion applicable to subsistence will be permitted.\r\n\r\n  31. In the cases of cadets of the orphan class, whose annual\r\ncontribution is only 20_l._, the amount to be paid when the absence\r\nextends over a whole term will be submitted to and determined by the\r\nSecretary of State.\r\n\r\n  32. Every gentleman cadet will be supplied with a weekly allowance of\r\npocket money, at the discretion of the commandant of the college; but\r\nthis allowance will not exceed 4_s._ 6_d._ a week for a gentleman cadet\r\nwho is a responsible under officer, 4_s._ a week for a gentleman cadet\r\nwho is an under officer, 3_s._ 6_d._ a week for a gentleman cadet who is\r\na corporal, and 2_s._ 6_d._ a week for all other gentlemen cadets. The\r\nexpense of this allowance will be defrayed out of the amount deposited\r\nfor the purpose of meeting contingent expenses, and in the case of\r\nQueen’s or Indian cadets it will be borne by the public.\r\n\r\n  _Discipline._\r\n\r\n  33. All gentlemen cadets are subject to such rules and regulations as\r\nare, or may be from time to time, established for the maintenance of\r\ngood order and discipline.\r\n\r\n  34. Every gentleman cadet will be liable to be removed from the\r\ncollege at any time should his conduct be such as to render it obvious\r\nthat his remaining would be either hurtful to the institution or\r\nunprofitable to himself.\r\n\r\n  35. To every cadet will be assigned, at the commencement of each term,\r\n100 marks for conduct.\r\n\r\n  From this number deductions will be made in certain authorized\r\nproportions for every offence which shall have been met by a punishment\r\nof more than two days’ drill.\r\n\r\n  Should the cadet forfeit more than three-fourths, or 75 of the above\r\n100 marks, he will not be gazetted to his commission until all other\r\ngentlemen cadets of the same batch shall have been provided for; and\r\nshould he lose all his marks for conduct he will be rusticated for one\r\nterm.\r\n\r\n  36. Gentlemen cadets are strictly prohibited from contracting debts\r\nwith any publican or tradesman in the vicinity of the college.\r\n\r\n  37. No perquisites or presents of any kind are to be received by any\r\nperson belonging to the college from either the gentlemen cadets or\r\ntheir friends.\r\n\r\n  38. Gentlemen cadets will not be allowed to remain at the college\r\nduring the vacations without the special sanction of the Secretary of\r\nState for War, on satisfactory proof being shown that they have no\r\nfriends in the United Kingdom to whom they could go. Payment of 1_l._\r\n1_s._ a week will be required in such cases from those who are not\r\nQueen’s cadets.\r\n\r\n  _Termination of the Course, and removal from the College._\r\n\r\n  39. The course of study is calculated for a residence of three terms,\r\nor 18 months, reckoned from the commencement of the term in which a\r\ngentleman cadet may join. It is open, however, for any cadet, who at the\r\nend of his first term shall have proved himself qualified for promotion\r\nat once to the third term classes, to compete for a commission without\r\npurchase, or to be examined for a commission by purchase, at the end of\r\nhis second term; but no fourth term will be allowed on any plea but that\r\nof long continued sickness, in which case special application must be\r\nmade to the Commander-in-Chief, accompanied by an opinion from the\r\nsurgeon of the college.\r\n\r\n  Gentlemen cadets allowed a fourth term will not be permitted to\r\ncompete for commissions without purchase.\r\n\r\n  40. Examinations for commissions will be held periodically. The number\r\nof commissions to be given without purchase will be announced previously\r\nto the examination. These will be competed for and awarded to the\r\ncandidates who are first in order of merit.\r\n\r\n  41. Candidates who have not succeeded in obtaining a place amongst\r\nthose to whom commissions without purchase can be awarded, but who have\r\nobtained the minimum number of marks required for qualification, will be\r\nconsidered to have prior claims to all other candidates for commissions\r\nby purchase.\r\n\r\n  42. Queen’s and Indian cadets will receive commissions without\r\npurchase on passing the qualifying examination. The names of those who\r\ndistinguish themselves equally with competitors for commissions without\r\npurchase will be published in the same lists with the latter.\r\n\r\n  43. In every case a certificate of conduct and proficiency in military\r\nand athletic exercises will be required from the governor of the college\r\nbefore a cadet can be examined for his commission.\r\n\r\n  44. Any gentleman cadet desirous of entering the Royal Artillery or\r\nRoyal Engineers will be permitted, if otherwise eligible, to offer\r\nhimself as a candidate at any of the competitive examinations for\r\nadmission into the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich; and his position\r\nat the Royal Military College will not be affected by his failure at\r\nsuch examination.\r\n\r\n  45. No gentleman cadet will be allowed to present himself at a direct\r\ncommission examination during his residence at the Royal Military\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\n  46. No gentleman cadet is to be removed from the college without the\r\npermission of the Commander-in-Chief, obtained through the governor of\r\nthe college. And when a parent or guardian intends to withdraw a cadet,\r\nor, if of age, the gentleman cadet intends to leave the college at the\r\nend of a term, at least six weeks’ notice of his intention is to be\r\ngiven to the governor. In default of such notice a quarter’s\r\nsubscription must be paid.\r\n\r\n  _Miscellaneous._\r\n\r\n  47. The establishment for Queen’s cadets having been sanctioned by\r\nParliament when the age of admission to the Royal Military College was\r\nfrom 13 to 15 years, it has been decided that in any case when the\r\nservices of the father and the circumstances of his family are such as\r\nto constitute a claim, an addition of not more than 40_l._ a year to the\r\n“compassionate allowance” may, at the discretion of the Secretary of\r\nState for War, be allowed to a candidate who is over 13, to enable him\r\nto complete his preparatory education, as he is ineligible for immediate\r\nadmission into the college in consequence of the minimum age of\r\nadmission having been raised to 16.\r\n\r\n  48. It is desirable that every candidate who is under 21 years of age\r\nshould, at his admission, be accompanied by his parent, guardian, or\r\nsome other responsible person, to satisfy the requirements of the\r\ncollege on his behalf.\r\n\r\n  49.

To these studies are added\r\nchemistry or physics, geology, and a second modern language.\r\n\r\nFor educational purposes, the cadet corps is divided into three\r\ncompanies, designated A, B, C, each company pursuing the same subjects\r\nat the same time, with a classification of members into sections,\r\naccording to the results of the minor and term examinations. The minor\r\nexaminations take place every six weeks, and the term examinations every\r\nsix months, and the final examination at the close of the course, which\r\noccupies three terms of six months each. The final examination is\r\nconducted by examiners attached to the Council of Military Education.\r\nThe final result, as bearing on a commission, is reached by adding the\r\nmarks as determined by the average of the minor and term examinations,\r\nand the answers of the final examination.\r\n\r\nThe instruction is given in halls of study, of which there are 18, large\r\nenough to accommodate, each, 18 cadets, but generally occupied by\r\n15. The lecture hall will accommodate 100 without crowding.\r\n\r\n1. _Mathematics_, elementary for all sections, including arithmetic,\r\nalgebra up to simple equations, euclid, the use of logarithmic tables,\r\nelementary problems in heights and distances, and mensuration; and\r\nhigher in the third section, including trigonometry and practical\r\nmechanics and hydrostatics, occupies 21 hours a week during the entire\r\nresidence. To this branch is assigned a professor, one senior master,\r\nand three other masters. To the highest proficiency in mathematics is\r\nassigned a maximum of 1,200 marks, and a minimum of 300 is allowed to\r\ncount.\r\n\r\n2. _Fortification_ includes field and the elements of permanent\r\nfortification, with a preparatory course of practical geometry. To this\r\nstudy, which occupies three hours every day, or 18 hours per week, are\r\nassigned six professors, and to the highest proficiency is awarded a\r\nmaximum of 1,800 marks, with a minimum of 450. Field fortification is\r\ntaught in the first two terms, plan drawing and practical work going on\r\ntogether. The cadets trace and execute portions of fieldworks, making\r\nand planting revetement, gabions, and fascines, and doing all but the\r\nheavy work, which is left to the sappers. They are also instructed in\r\nbridge making and in pontooning, and witness every species of work done\r\nin the hall, on the fortification ground.\r\n\r\n3. _Military Surveying and Drawing_ occupy together 17 hours, under 12\r\nprofessors. The cadets commence by drawing from copies, then from\r\nmodels, being in the meantime also taught the use of instruments; then\r\nin six weeks after joining the corps, they are taken out to triangulate\r\nwith the prismatic compass and pacing, and traverse roads. The former\r\npractice with the theodilite and sextant has been abandoned, and the\r\nwhole instruction has been concentrated on the art of field sketching as\r\nof more importance to an infantry officer. To the highest proficiency in\r\nthis subject is given 1,800 marks, and a minimum of 450 is allowed to\r\ncount in the final result. In the final examination the candidate for a\r\ncommission must obtain at least 1,200 marks in the above subjects.\r\n\r\n4. _Military History and Geography_ is under the charge of one professor\r\nand two instructors. The present course is to give instruction by\r\nlecture, in the organization and mode of action of the three arms, and\r\nexplanation of the operation of the commissariat and transport\r\ndepartment of an army, followed by a short and simple campaign. In the\r\nsecond half-year, two campaigns are selected, with a view to illustrate\r\nthe generally received principles of tactics and strategy, and in the\r\nthird half-year one campaign is thoroughly worked out in detail. The\r\ncadets take notes of the lecture, on which they are examined orally, and\r\nafter the main propositions and facts are printed by the professor, a\r\nsubsequent study and examination on the printed scheme is had. In this\r\nstudy the cadets draw plans of the theatre of war and of battles,\r\nshowing the position of the opposing forces.\r\n\r\n5. _Languages_, French and German,--the former with one professor and\r\nthree masters, and the latter with one master. The usual course in\r\neither language is grammar, exercises, dictation, translation, and\r\ncomposition. To the highest proficiency in either, 1,200 marks are\r\nassigned, and a minimum of 300 is allowed. One of these languages is\r\nobligatory in the final examination, but the candidate can be examined\r\nin both. The cadets can change from one language to the other at the\r\nbeginning of the term.\r\n\r\n6. _Chemistry_ (including sound, heat, electricity, and magnetism) and\r\n_Geology_ (including mineralogy and physical geography) occupy each a\r\nhalf hour four days in the week, and employ part of the time of two\r\nprofessors.\r\n\r\n7. _Freehand or Landscape Drawing_ receives two lessons per week, first\r\nfrom copies and models, and in the third term one lesson per week from\r\nnature. To the highest proficiency is assigned 600 marks, and a minimum\r\nof 150 is allowed.\r\n\r\n8. _Military exercises_ enter into the programme for the day, and\r\nconsist of gymnastics for the first term, gun-drill and riding (one\r\nlesson per week) in the second term, and two lessons in the last\r\nexercises for the third term. Parade and infantry drill occupy, in\r\naddition, half an hour before breakfast, and 50 minutes between the\r\nfirst and second period of study in the morning (9.30 and 10.50).\r\n\r\nFor qualification a cadet must obtain an aggregate of 1,200 marks out of\r\n5,400 on the three military subjects, and a total aggregate of 1,950 of\r\nthese. Similar proportions of marks must be obtained each term that the\r\ncadet may return in the following term.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF EXAMINATIONS.\r\n\r\nOut of 2,399 admission examinations in eleven years, from 1858 to 1868,\r\n444 were unsuccessful; and in the final examinations, in the same\r\nperiod, out of 1,726, 25 failed. The results of the examinations show\r\nbetter preparation from year to year.\r\n\r\nEXPENDITURES.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of the government, on account of the Military College,\r\nwere as follows: for 1858-9, £27,969; for 1863-4, £39,690; for 1866-7,\r\n£36,416, exclusive of payments made by the cadets or by the Indian\r\ngovernment, which, in 1866-67 was £4,237.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY AT WOOLWICH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy at Woolwich was instituted by George II. in 1741,\r\nto give instruction to officers who served in the Artillery and\r\nEngineers. It began in a small room in a building at Woolwich, where the\r\nBoard of Ordnance used occasionally to assemble, under the instruction\r\nof two masters, who lectured by rotation during four consecutive hours\r\nin three days of every week. At first only the officers of the single\r\nbattalion composing the Artillery, and of the corps of Engineers, were\r\nrequired to attend. In the second year non-commissioned officers, and\r\nprivates too, were at liberty to attend, and upon its close cadets, to\r\nthe number of five to each company of artillery, resorted to the hall.\r\nBeing sons of officers of the corps, and not in uniform or under\r\nmilitary control, the cadets became an element of disorder, which led to\r\na more systematic organization. In 1744, the cadets were clothed in\r\nuniform, and collected into a distinct company, under two officers, with\r\na drum-major. By 1782, the number of cadets had increased from twenty to\r\nsixty, and in 1798, to one hundred,--boarding with their families. In\r\nthe last year arrangements were made to lodge and board the cadets by\r\nallowing 2_s._ a day per head, until by degrees, in 1857, an imposing\r\npile of buildings had been erected, and the establishment for government\r\nand instruction consisted of 18 officers on the military staff, and some\r\nfifty professors and masters in the civil and educational corps.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATIONS FOR ADMISSION.\r\n\r\nPreviously to the year 1855 admission to the Royal Military Academy\r\ncould only be obtained by a nomination from the Master-General of the\r\nOrdnance. The limits of age for admission were at that time from 14 to\r\n16, and the candidates nominated were required to pass an entrance\r\nexamination before the professors of the Academy, which varied somewhat\r\naccording to the age of the individual. A certain number of the\r\ncandidates previously passed though the preparatory school at\r\nCarshalton, admission to which was equally obtained by nomination from\r\nthe Master-General of the Ordnance, and were transferred to the Academy\r\non passing an examination similar to that required from those who\r\nentered the latter establishment direct. The term of residence at the\r\nAcademy varied, according to the progress of a cadet, from two to four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe inability of the Academy to meet the demand for officers for the\r\nArtillery and Engineers created by the Crimean war, led to the\r\nintroduction of a new system of obtaining commissions in the scientific\r\ncorps. At first a limited number of nominations were placed in the hands\r\nof the head masters of the great public schools of the country, and the\r\ncandidates nominated by them were appointed to provisional commissions\r\non passing an examination at Woolwich; but after a short time the\r\nprinciple of open competition for admission to the Artillery and\r\nEngineers was adopted, in 1855, by Lord Panmure, when Secretary of State\r\nfor War. Simultaneously with this change--the first recognition of the\r\ncompetitive principle in regard to military education in this country--a\r\ngreat alteration was made in the limits of age for admission to the\r\nscientific corps. Both direct appointments to commissions in the\r\nArtillery and Engineers, without any previous special instruction, and\r\nadmissions to the senior or practical class at the Academy, without\r\npassing through the lower or theoretical classes at that institution,\r\nwere thrown open to public competition among all natural-born subjects\r\nof Her Majesty. The limits of age for candidates for the direct\r\nappointments were from 19 to 21. Those who were successful were in the\r\nfirst instance to receive provisional commissions, and to be placed for\r\ninstruction under the Director of Artillery Studies, at Woolwich, for a\r\nperiod of about six months, at the end of which they were to be\r\npermanently commissioned. Candidates for admission to the practical\r\nclass at the Academy were required to be between the ages of 17 and 19;\r\nthose admitted were to remain in the practical class for six or eight\r\nmonths, after which, on passing an examination, they were to receive\r\ncommissions in the Artillery or Engineers. The first competitive\r\nexamination under this system (the regulations for which will be found\r\nbelow) was held in August, 1855, and was conducted by a body of\r\nexaminers specially appointed for the purpose, under the direction of\r\nCanon Moseley. The examination for both classes of appointments thrown\r\nopen to competition was the same, and was based on the general education\r\nof the country, the object being merely to compare the abilities and\r\nattainments of the candidates without reference to special professional\r\nknowledge. Two other similar examinations, both for provisional\r\ncommissions and for admission to the practical class, were held in\r\nJanuary and June, 1856, the only difference being that the limits of age\r\nof the candidates were somewhat extended, and that in these later\r\nexaminations no commissions in the _Engineers_ were offered to\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of the Crimean war, however, the system of appointing\r\nofficers directly from civil life to commissions in the scientific\r\ncorps, as well as that of admitting candidates to the practical class at\r\nthe Academy, which had been adopted to meet the pressure of the war,\r\ncame to an end. No other examination after that in June, 1856, was held\r\nfor a year; but in June, 1857, the first competitive examination for\r\nadmission to the ordinary course of instruction at the Academy took\r\nplace. The limits of age for admission were fixed at 17 to 20, and it\r\nwas announced that the successful candidates would remain under\r\ninstruction at the Academy “until sufficiently advanced in scientific\r\nknowledge to pass a satisfactory examination.”\r\n\r\nSince this period open competitive examinations have been held regularly\r\nevery six months for admission to the Academy; and though various\r\nmodifications in their details have been made, their general character\r\nremains little altered. The limits of age for candidates, originally\r\nplaced at 17 to 20, were, however, in 1862, reduced to 16 to 19, at\r\nwhich they are at present fixed.\r\n\r\nThe examinations for admission to the Academy, like those which had\r\npreviously been held for provisional commissions and for appointments to\r\nthe practical class, were at first conducted by Canon Moseley and a\r\nspecial Board of Examiners appointed by the Secretary of State for War,\r\nwith whom the general management of the Academy, after the abolition of\r\nthe office of Master-General of the Ordnance, remained. In 1858,\r\nhowever, the superintendence of the system of instruction at Woolwich\r\nwas transferred to the Council of Military Education, who, since July,\r\n1859, have conducted the examinations.\r\n\r\nAlthough the principle of open competition for appointments in the\r\nscientific corps was first recognized in 1855, and in 1857 was extended\r\ngenerally to admission to the ordinary course of instruction at the\r\nAcademy, yet the system of competitive examination did not become the\r\nsole and universal means of admission to Woolwich until the year 1861.\r\nTime was required to clear off the vested interests of candidates who\r\nhad been placed on the old nomination list of the Master-General of the\r\nOrdnance; of youths who had been admitted to the preparatory school at\r\nCarshalton; of cadets who, at the time of the proposed amalgamation of\r\nSandhurst and Woolwich, had obtained admission to the former institution\r\non the understanding that they would have the opportunity of obtaining\r\ncommissions in the Artillery and Engineers; and, lastly, of cadets at\r\nthe Indian Military College at Addiscombe, who, on the abolition of the\r\nlocal Indian army, were transferred to Woolwich before receiving\r\ncommissions in the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers.\r\n\r\nOut of 3,085 admission examinations in eleven years, from 1858 to 1868,\r\nmore than one-half (2,136) failed. Of those who entered after this\r\ntrial, in the same length of time, only three failed to pass the final\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n  STAFF OF GOVERNMENT AND INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n  _President._--Duke of Cambridge, K.G.\r\n  _Governor._--Major General J.

Competitive examinations for admission are held in London twice a\r\nyear, in January and July. They are conducted by examiners appointed for\r\nthe purpose, in the presence and under the superintendence of the\r\nCouncil of Military Education.\r\n\r\n  The candidates must be between 16 and 19 years of age.\r\n\r\n  II. The admissions will be determined by the result of the\r\nexamination, the subjects of which will be as follows, viz.:\r\n\r\n\r\nMarks.\r\n    1. Mathematics\r\n       { Pure\r\n       { { Section I. Arithmetic, algebra, Euclid,\r\n       { {   plane trigonometry,                           2,000 }\r\n       { { Section II.

English language and composition,                           1,000\r\n    3. History of England, its dependencies and colonies,          1,000\r\n    4. Geography (modern),                                         1,000\r\n    5. Classics { Latin language,                                  1,500\r\n                { Greek do.,                                       1,500\r\n    6.

Hindustani do.,                                             1,000\r\n\r\n    The examination in French, German, and Hindustani, will include\r\n    writing from dictation.\r\n\r\n    9. Experimental sciences, _i.e._, chemistry, heat,\r\n                                  electricity, magnetism,          1,000\r\n\r\n    10. Natural sciences, _i.e._, mineralogy and geology,          1,000\r\n\r\n    11. Drawing {  Free-hand drawing of machinery, architectural,\r\n                {  topographical, landscape or figure subjects,    1,000\r\n\r\n  Every candidate must qualify in geometrical drawing; _i.e._, drawing\r\nin ink, with accuracy, neatness, and to scale, the several problems of\r\nEuclid. The standard of qualification in this subject is 100 marks,\r\nwhich must be gained, out of a maximum of 300 nominally assigned to it.\r\nBut the marks so gained will not count toward the general aggregate.\r\n\r\n  III. No candidate will be allowed to be examined in more than five\r\nsubjects, of which one must be mathematics, and no one who does not\r\nobtain at least 700 marks in section I. of pure mathematics, will be\r\neligible for an appointment.\r\n\r\n  From the other subjects of examination, to which marks are assigned as\r\nabove, each candidate may select any, not exceeding four in number, in\r\nwhich he desires to be examined. The rules for counting marks in such\r\nsubjects are as follows:\r\n\r\n  In all subjects carrying marks, except the 1st section of mathematics,\r\nin which 700 marks are required, one-sixth of the number allotted to\r\neach must be gained before they can be allowed to count.\r\n\r\n  In classics, the subject is divided into two sections as above, either\r\nor both of which the candidate may take up as one subject; but he will\r\nnot be allowed to count the marks gained in either section unless they\r\namount to one-sixth of the number allotted to it.\r\n\r\n  In either _French_, _German_, or _Hindustani_, every candidate will be\r\nrequired to obtain for qualification one-sixth of the maximum of marks,\r\nwhether he takes it up as a subject in which he desires to compete or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n  It should be understood that, although only a small qualifying test\r\nhas been imposed in respect to modern languages, a knowledge of them on\r\nadmission will contribute greatly to a candidate’s future success at the\r\nRoyal Military Academy.\r\n\r\n  IV. The candidates are allowed to answer as many questions as the time\r\nallotted to the subject will permit.\r\n\r\n  V. No candidate will be admitted unless he obtain an aggregate of at\r\nleast 2,500 marks.\r\n\r\n  VI. The successful candidates will remain under instruction for about\r\ntwo years and a half, or until they are sufficiently advanced in\r\nscientific knowledge to pass a satisfactory examination, and they will\r\nthen be qualified to receive commissions in the Royal Artillery or Royal\r\nEngineers. If, however, they should be found unable to qualify\r\nthemselves within three years in their professional studies, or to\r\nacquire a sufficient proficiency in military exercises, or if at any\r\ntime, by failure at the half-yearly examinations, it should appear\r\nimprobable that they will ultimately succeed in qualifying for a\r\ncommission, they will be removed. Further, every cadet will be liable to\r\nbe removed temporarily or permanently on the commission of any of those\r\noffences to which such penalty is awarded by the regulations of the\r\nRoyal Military Academy.\r\n\r\n  VII. Each cadet on joining will be required to pay a sum of 25_l._ to\r\ncover the expense of uniform, books, etc., and to bring with him the\r\narticles of clothing of which he will receive notice, and which must\r\nafterward be kept up at his own expense. He will also be required to pay\r\na contribution of 62_l._ 10_s._, payable in advance, for each half year\r\nof the time during which he remains under instruction; and a deposit of\r\n5_l._ into the hands of the paymaster on account, for contingent\r\nexpenses, which latter sum he will be required to make up on returning\r\nto the Royal Military Academy after each vacation, to cover any\r\nunavoidable expense that may be incurred on his account during the\r\nensuing half year.\r\n\r\n  The annual contributions, however, for sons and orphans of naval and\r\nmilitary officers will be regulated at the following rates, as\r\nheretofore:\r\n\r\n    For sons of admirals and of generals having regiments,           £80\r\n    For sons of generals without regiments,                           70\r\n    For sons of captains and commanders of the navy,\r\n      and of colonels and regimental field officers of the army,      60\r\n    For sons of all officers of the army and navy under\r\n      the above ranks,                                                40\r\n    For sons of all officers of the army and navy who have died\r\n      in the service, and whose families are proved to be left\r\n      in pecuniary distress,                                          20\r\n\r\n  The sons of general officers who are paid only on their commissions as\r\nfield officers will pay the same contributions as the sons of field\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n  Officers who have sold their commissions are in this classification\r\nreckoned as private gentlemen.\r\n\r\n  The cases of officers who have retired voluntarily upon half pay\r\nprevious to having served 25 years on full pay will be specially\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n  Officers who retire on half pay after 25 years’ service on full pay\r\nwill be entitled to be classified for payment with the rank they last\r\nserved in.\r\n\r\n  The sons of officers of the civil departments of the army and navy, of\r\nofficers of the permanent Militia Staff, and of adjutants of the\r\nVolunteer Force, are admissible to the Academy upon the same terms as\r\nthose prescribed for naval and military officers.\r\n\r\n  The sons of Indian naval and military officers will be admitted on the\r\nsame terms as the sons of officers of the Queen’s service.\r\n\r\n    The sons of professors at the Staff and Royal Military\r\n      Colleges, at the Royal Military Academy, and at the\r\n      Royal Military College, Addiscombe,                      £60\r\n    The sons of masters at the above institutions,              40\r\n\r\n  If a cadet be absent a whole term in consequence of sickness or\r\nrustication, a payment of 10_l._ will be required for the privilege of\r\nhis name being kept on the rolls of the establishment, and for a vacancy\r\nbeing guaranteed at the commencement of the next term.\r\n\r\n  If a cadet be absent from sickness during a portion of the term, his\r\npay will continue to be issued and credited to his account; but no\r\nrefund of the contribution will be permitted.\r\n\r\n  If rusticated during a term, the daily pay will cease from the date on\r\nwhich the cadet is sent away, and the contribution made for the half\r\nyear will be forfeited.\r\n\r\n  In the case of a cadet of the orphan class, whose annual contribution\r\nis only 20_l._, the amount to be paid when absence extends over a whole\r\nterm is to be determined by the Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n  VIII. Any gentleman who wishes to present himself at one of the\r\nhalf-yearly examinations must send in his name to the military secretary\r\nat the Horse Guards one month before the time of examination, forwarding\r\nwith his application to be noted the following papers:\r\n\r\n  1st. An extract from the register of his baptism, or, in default of\r\nthat, a declaration before a magistrate, made by one of his parents,\r\ngiving his exact age.\r\n\r\n  2d. A certificate of good moral character, signed by a clergyman of\r\nthe parish to which he belongs, and by the tutor or head of the school\r\nor college at which he has received his education for at least the two\r\npreceding years, or such other proof of good moral character as will be\r\nsatisfactory to the Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n  3d. A statement of the subjects of examination in which (in addition\r\nto mathematics) he may desire to be examined.\r\n\r\n  A candidate who has been examined before, when he applies for leave to\r\npresent himself again, will only be required to forward the list of\r\nsubjects he selects, and a certificate from his tutor or the head of his\r\nschool, etc., for the interval between the two examinations.\r\n\r\n  IX. The candidates will be inspected by military surgeons on the first\r\nday of the examination, in order that it may be ascertained that they\r\nare free from any bodily defects or ailments calculated to interfere\r\nwith the performance of military duties.\r\n\r\n  Extreme short-sight, or any serious defect of vision, is regarded as a\r\ndisqualification.\r\n\r\n  The responsible parent or guardian of every successful candidate, and\r\nthe candidate himself, before he can be admitted as a cadet, are\r\nrequired to sign, respectively, obligations to conform to the\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECTS AND STAFF OF INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nFor instruction the Cadets are divided into five classes of equal\r\nstrength, according to length of residence; forty-four in the first four\r\nclasses, and forty-six in the junior. The subjects are:\r\n\r\n1. Mathematics, under a professor and four instructors, is studied in\r\nthree classes, and the final examination is held after a residence of a\r\nyear and a half, with a maximum of 6,800 marks in all.\r\n\r\n2. Fortification, under a professor and four instructors, is studied in\r\nfour classes. The final examination is in the last class, and the\r\nmaximum of marks attainable in all is 6,300.\r\n\r\n3. Artillery, under a professor and three instructors, is studied in two\r\nclasses; the second and first, and the final examination, is in the\r\nfirst, with a maximum of 6,200 marks.\r\n\r\n4. Surveying and topographical drawing, under a professor and four\r\ninstructors, is studied in all the classes, and the final examination is\r\nat the completion of the course, with a total of 4,200 marks.\r\n\r\n5. Practical Geometry, under a professor and two instructors, is studied\r\nin two classes, and the final examination is at the close of the first\r\nyear, with an aggregate of 2,100 marks.\r\n\r\n6. Mechanics and Natural Philosophy, under one professor, are studied in\r\nthe last two terms, and the final examination is in the last, with a\r\nmaximum of 1,600 marks in the former, and 900 in the latter.\r\n\r\n7. French and German are studied, each under a professor and two\r\ninstructors, for four terms, and after the final examination in the\r\nsecond class. The total marks in each is 1,500. Hindustani can be\r\nsubstituted for German.\r\n\r\n8. Landscape Drawing, under two instructors, is studied in three\r\nclasses, and the final examination is in the third class, with a maximum\r\nof 1,500 marks.\r\n\r\n9. Military History is taught by one professor in the last two terms,\r\nand has a maximum of 2,000 marks.\r\n\r\n10. Chemistry, under one lecturer, is taught in the last term, and\r\nreceives a total of 1,200 marks.\r\n\r\n11. Gymnastics, drill, and riding are taught as follows: Regular\r\ngymnastic instruction is conducted by a superintendent and three\r\nsergeants, for at least six months, and practised through all the terms.\r\nArtillery drill, with gun, sword, and other military drill and tactics,\r\nare conducted partly by military officers and partly by the professors\r\nand instructors of artillery. Riding drill is conducted under the\r\nofficers of the Royal Artillery, in the last two terms, and is practised\r\nfour or five hours a week. Swimming is taught optionally.\r\n\r\n12. Recreations and amusements are optional and at the expense of the\r\nCadets. Workshops are maintained by the government, but tools and\r\nmaterials are furnished at the expense of the Cadets. There are two\r\nreading rooms.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL PREPARATION FOR WOOLWICH.\r\n\r\nFrom the returns and evidence furnished, it is an extremely rare\r\noccurrence for a candidate to go up direct from a public school which\r\ndoes not possess a Modern Department to the examination for admission to\r\nWoolwich. Out of 855 candidates admitted to Woolwich in 10 years--from\r\n1858 to 1867--the six public schools of Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester,\r\nWestminster, and Shrewsbury, only sent up five direct. Colonel Addison\r\nstates that at Sandhurst, out of 320 admissions during the last two\r\nyears, there have been only 16 from the nine schools mentioned in the\r\nReport of the Royal Commission on Public Schools; but from Cheltenham\r\nand Wellington College the admissions have been more numerous. Even for\r\nthe direct commission examination, those who present themselves from\r\npublic schools (including Cheltenham and Marlborough, where Modern\r\nDepartments exist), without seeking the assistance of a private tutor,\r\nscarcely amount to five per cent. of the whole number of candidates. At\r\nthe same time, it may be observed that the proportion of failures among\r\nsuch candidates in the latter examination is comparatively slight, not\r\namounting to more than 8 per cent., while the average number of failures\r\namong the candidates generally during the last four years has been very\r\nnearly 25 per cent. In fact, the general tenor of the evidence goes to\r\nshow that, in the case of the examinations both for direct commissions\r\nand for admission to Sandhurst, there is, or at least should be, no\r\nnecessity for candidates who have had the ordinary education of a\r\nclassical public school to have recourse to private tuition. The\r\nWoolwich examination appears generally to be regarded in a different\r\nlight. Its higher and more special character, and the great importance\r\nattached to mathematics, coupled with the competition which exists for\r\nit, render it apparently doubtful whether success would generally be\r\nobtained by candidates from public schools--other than those where, like\r\nCheltenham, instruction is given with a particular view to this\r\nexamination--without a special preparatory tuition.\r\n\r\nThe general character of the “Modern Side” at Harrow, which was\r\nestablished in September of 1869, “for the benefit of boys for whom,\r\nfrom various causes, an advanced classical training seems undesirable,”\r\nis explained as follows in a circular issued by the Head-Master when\r\nannouncing the intention of adopting the institution:\r\n\r\n  The principal subjects of instruction on the “Modern Side” will be\r\nmathematics, French, German, Latin, history, English literature, and\r\nphysical science.\r\n\r\n  The requirements of boys not intended for the Universities will be\r\nspecially kept in view, including the case of those who are candidates\r\nfor Woolwich or the Indian Civil Service. It is hoped that this\r\nprovision may obviate the supposed necessity for removing boys to a\r\nprivate tutor’s precisely at an age when the influences of public school\r\nlife are most powerful and most salutary.\r\n\r\n  Except for purposes of instruction there will be no distinction\r\nwhatever between boys on the Modern Side and boys on the Classical Side.\r\n\r\n  No boy will, for the present, be admitted to the Modern Side unless he\r\nhas been in the school for at least a year, and has hitherto shown\r\ndiligence and made fair progress.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the instruction in the “Army Class” at Eton is described\r\nby the Head-Master (Rev. Dr. Hornly) as follows:\r\n\r\n  The Army Class was established by Dr. Goodrich in the year 1858. It\r\nwas established in order to give Eton boys greater facilities for\r\npreparing certain subjects which were required in the army examinations,\r\nand to obviate the supposed necessity of giving Eton boys a special\r\npreparation, elsewhere than at Eton, in order to fit them for the army\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\n  At first fortification and military drawing were included in the\r\ncourse, and a considerable proportion of the ordinary school work\r\n(_e.g._, Latin verse writing) was remitted.\r\n\r\n  This was not found to answer. The course included more than was\r\nnecessary for the ordinary army examination, and not enough for the\r\nhigher examinations at Woolwich. There seemed to be a danger of the\r\nclass becoming a sort of refuge for the idlest boys in the school.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Goodford subsequently altered all this, and placed the class upon\r\nits present footing, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Two lessons a week (repetition lessons) are remitted to make time for\r\nlessons in modern history. English essays, or abstracts of what has been\r\ntaught in school, are written by the boys out of school (one exercise a\r\nweek), and carefully looked over. No other part of the ordinary school\r\nwork (except the two repetition lessons) is given up. Boys cannot join\r\nthe class till they are 16 years of age. They are expected to stay at\r\nEton till the time comes for their examination. The class consists at\r\npresent of 28 boys, with an average of 25.\r\n\r\n  The class has certainly been successful. No boy going up from Eton has\r\nfailed yet in the army examination since the reconstitution of the class\r\nof which I have spoken. I think the class has done good in the school.\r\n\r\n  It will be seen that nothing more has been seriously attempted as yet\r\nthan to secure boys from failure in the ordinary examinations. If boys\r\nare to be prepared at Eton for any higher competition, such as that at\r\nWoolwich, a very different course will obviously be necessary, and\r\nprobably a system of “bifurcation” will be found indispensable.\r\n\r\n  I am not prepared to say that this may not be introduced with\r\nadvantage at Eton; but the impending changes in the governing body at\r\nEton, and the anticipated changes with regard to army examinations, make\r\nit difficult to commence any work of reconstruction at the present\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe most successful institutions in preparing candidates either for\r\nSandhurst or Woolwich are the Cheltenham and Wellington Colleges--each\r\nhaving a Modern Department, in which Latin and Greek yield their\r\nsupremacy to modern science and living languages.\r\n\r\n  The Modern Department in Cheltenham College was established in 1843 as\r\na Military School, and is claimed to be such at this time. The studies\r\nof subjects consist of mathematics, drawing of all kinds, physical\r\nscience, two modern languages (French and German), English, surveying,\r\nand fortification, both field and permanent. The principal (Rev. T. A.\r\nSouthend), in his evidence before the Military Education Commission in\r\n1869, states that his pupils, at the age of eighteen, went through the\r\nwhole Addiscombe course, and all that was done at Woolwich, and a good\r\ndeal of what was done at Chatham. The whole of his class, in 1868, went\r\nup for the entrance examination at Sandhurst, and passed. From twelve to\r\nfifteen go to Woolwich every year, and in 1869, forty out of one hundred\r\nand twenty in the Academy were prepared at Cheltenham. The special\r\nmilitary instruction is based on a course of Latin and Greek.\r\n\r\n  Out of three hundred and twelve students in Wellington College,\r\nninety-six boys are in the Modern Side, entering at the age of twelve\r\nand thirteen, and remaining till seventeen or eighteen. But of the\r\nninety-six, forty are preparing for the Engineers or Artillery, and\r\ntwenty for the Line. The subjects taught in the military division are\r\nthe same as at Cheltenham, except fortification; and the head-master\r\n(Rev. Dr. Benson) claims, in his evidence before the Commission, that\r\nhis graduates are as well trained in the same subject as the pupils of\r\nSandhurst or Woolwich. He advises the establishment of exhibitions in\r\nthe Military School, open to competition to the pupils of all the public\r\nschools, and regards the modern side as an essential feature in all\r\npublic schools.\r\n\r\nRugby School was the earliest of the great Public Schools of England to\r\nmake Physical Science a regular part of its curriculum, and to give any\r\nconsiderable prominence to modern languages and history; but its\r\ngoverning authorities have resisted all efforts to establish a distinct\r\nModern Side.\r\n\r\n  The Rev. Dr. Temple, head-master of Rugby School (now Bishop of\r\nExeter), in his evidence before the Commission, remarked that the\r\ngeneral education of boys entering Sandhurst should be the same as that\r\ngiven to other boys of the same age, destined for any other profession\r\nthan that of arms. His opinion was adverse to having a modern\r\ndepartment, in which the ancient classics held a subordinate place, in a\r\nschool in which the classics held the first, and over which the\r\nhead-master presided. The modern studies should have an independent\r\nscope, and their own master, who will by his character and personal\r\nattention fix the standard of attainment. The great public schools\r\nshould hold on to their present aim and methods, introducing other\r\nstudies to perfect their mental discipline and results. No side sections\r\nor departments in any existing school can do the work of scientific\r\nschool culture so thoroughly as an independent school, in which the\r\nnatural sciences and modern languages are taught by the main staff of\r\nprofessors. All teachers, in any school, civil or military, should be\r\nspecially appointed for their educational qualities.\r\n\r\nIn Marlborough College, a modern department exists, which was\r\nestablished to prepare boys for definite examinations in which they\r\nwould not succeed if they competed direct from the classical side of the\r\nCollege, and at the same time to solve the problem of giving a good\r\nschool education on a basis of instruction in which the dead languages\r\nhold a subordinate place. Boys enter the Modern School after they have\r\nreached the fourth form in the classical department, so that Latin and\r\nGreek constitute a substantial part of their attainments and discipline.\r\nThe success of the graduates of this institution in competing for\r\nadmission into the military or civil service of the government, or in\r\nany of the walks of active or professional life, shows conclusively that\r\nthe modern curriculum with its studies properly adjusted, and a well\r\ntrained staff, under an able head-master, is quite equal to the\r\nclassical, not only in practical utility, but in comprehensive and\r\nliberal discipline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL SCHOOL OF MILITARY ENGINEERING AT CHATHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Engineering Establishment at Chatham was instituted in 1854,\r\nto furnish a sound course of practical instruction in Military and Civil\r\nEngineering to the officers, non-commissioned officers, and sappers of\r\nthe corps of Royal Engineers, in addition and prior to which both\r\nofficers and men pass through the ordinary drill and military duties\r\ncommon to the army generally.\r\n\r\nThe present organization and staff are composed of a director; an\r\ninstructor and assistant in construction and estimating; an instructor\r\nand assistant in field works; an instructor and assistant in surveying;\r\nan instructor and assistant in telegraphy, photography, and an assistant\r\nin signalling; a brigade major; quartermaster in charge of stores, and\r\nfield officer for military discipline.\r\n\r\n  The number of officers under instruction, recently\r\n    commissioned, captains and subalterns,                        81\r\n  Non-commissioned officers and sappers, average,              1,200\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURE AND LENGTH OF COURSE.\r\n\r\nThere are six distinct courses:\r\n\r\n1. Drill and military duties, which occupy 107 days. This includes,\r\nbesides the interior economy of a company, proceedings of\r\ncourts-martial, boards of survey, courts of inquiry.\r\n\r\n2. Telegraphy, signalling, submarine mines, etc., which occupy\r\nthirty-five days. This includes the construction and maintenance of\r\nlines, a knowledge of instruments and batteries, application of\r\nelectricity to explosions, management of torpedoes, etc.\r\n\r\n3. Chemistry, which occupies fifteen days. This course comprises the\r\nanalysis of limes, cements, and other building materials.\r\n\r\n4. Field works, military bridging, etc, which occupies 122 days. This\r\ncomprises instruction in earthworks, pontooning, rafts, spar, and other\r\ntemporary bridges, reports on existing fortresses, construction of\r\nrailways, escalading, diving, etc.\r\n\r\n5. Architectural course, which occupies 183 days. This course includes\r\nbuilding material, design, estimate, and specification for a building,\r\ninstruction and report, with hand sketches of various works in\r\nexecution, lime and cement works, quarrying, brickmaking, etc.\r\n\r\n6. Surveying and Astronomy, which occupy 183 days. This course includes\r\ntrigonometrical survey, military reconnoissance, special survey, road\r\nreconnoissance, astronomical memoranda and calculations, adaptation of\r\nworks of defence to a contoured site, inspection tours of works of\r\ndefence in England, and report on same, isolated lectures on geology,\r\nelectricity, machinery, etc., by selected professors.\r\n\r\nThe first allowance toward expenses of junior officers of the Royal\r\nEngineers, in visiting engineering works, at home and abroad, was made\r\nin 1854, and is now 500_l._ per annum.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTION FOR NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND SAPPERS.\r\n\r\nAll recruits for this corps join at Chatham, and for about sixteen\r\nmonths are subject to daily drill and military duties in field work and\r\nall branches of the engineer service, and are drafted off, from time to\r\ntime, into the special classes in construction, photography, telegraphy,\r\nlithography, printing.\r\n\r\n_Synopsis of the Course._\r\n\r\nThe following synopsis of the instruction given at the Royal School of\r\nMilitary Engineering at Chatham, was drawn up by Major General J. L.\r\nSimmons, the Director of the establishment.\r\n\r\n  I.--THE SURVEY COURSE.\r\n\r\n  The course of surveying for the officers of the Royal Engineers is\r\nintended to qualify them for carrying on survey operations of every\r\ndescription, and for designing and laying out engineering works, so far\r\nas these are influenced by the features of the ground on which they are\r\nplaced, or over which they are carried.\r\n\r\n  The course consists of two parts,--the one relating to surveying\r\nprocesses exclusively, the other to the uses made of the plans and maps\r\nprepared by such processes, for engineering purposes.\r\n\r\n  Under the first of these divisions the officers are practically\r\ninstructed in astronomical, general, special, and reconnoitring\r\nsurveying, including the accurate delineation of the inequalities of\r\nground by levelling and by contours traced instrumentally, and also the\r\ngiving reliefs to hill forms by sketching with the pen and drawing with\r\nthe brush.\r\n\r\n  Under the second division they are exercised in the adaptation of\r\nworks of fortification to contoured sites, and in the selection and\r\nsurvey of lines of communication by roads, railways, and canals, and in\r\ndrawing up projects for their execution.\r\n\r\n  _Astronomical Surveying._\r\n\r\n  The officers are taught the construction and use of astronomical\r\ninstruments, and are practised in making observations with them. They\r\nstudy from published works and memoranda printed at the establishment,\r\nthe most useful problems for finding the time, the latitude and\r\nlongitude, the direction of the meridian, and the variation of the\r\ncompass.\r\n\r\n  Examples of each problem are worked out by them from their own\r\nobservations or from observations made in their presence.\r\n\r\n  The use of meteorological instruments and the reductions of the\r\nobservations made with them are also practised.\r\n\r\n  _General Survey._\r\n\r\n  As a preliminary exercise in drawing each officer constructs a plate\r\nof scales from data supplied to him. For particular information on the\r\ndelicate and powerful instruments and apparatus which have been used in\r\ngreat national surveys, and which cannot be studied in the establishment\r\nobservatory, the officers are referred to published works; and they are\r\ninstructed in the adjustments, the unavoidable errors of construction,\r\nand the powers of the instruments put into their hands for the execution\r\nof their survey course.\r\n\r\n  The general survey comprises:\r\n\r\n  1st. _The selection and measurement of a base._--The base is measured\r\nwith an ordinary chain and a five-inch theodolite, and this measurement\r\nhaving been reduced to its horizontal value at the level of the sea, the\r\nsection of the base is laid down on paper.\r\n\r\n  2d. _Triangulation._--The measured base is extended by a triangulation\r\nover 10 or 16 square miles of country, and the relative altitudes of,\r\nand the distances between, the stations selected are determined from\r\nobservations. The computed horizontal distances are laid down, and the\r\nazimuth of one of them is determined.\r\n\r\n  3d. _Traversing._--The positions of the roads, streams, boundaries of\r\nwoods, and other marked features, surrounding and intersecting an area\r\nof six or eight square miles of the country triangulated, are then\r\ndetermined by running traverses with a theodolite from one station to\r\nanother, so as to cut up this area into spaces which will admit of being\r\nfilled in by a less accurate method, without introducing an error in the\r\nplan.\r\n\r\n  4th. _Plotting of detail and completion of the work._--The protracted\r\nlines are now transferred to another sheet of paper, and the detail,\r\nobtained as the traverses proceed, is plotted from the field-book. From\r\nthis plot sketch sheets are prepared, and the remainder of the work is\r\nsketched in with the aid of a prismatic compass, the form of the ground\r\nbeing represented by pencil strokes, assisted by contours put in with\r\nthe aid of a portable level.\r\n\r\n  The sketch sheets are etched in with a pen, and a finished brush-work\r\nplan of the complete survey, embracing all the information collected, is\r\nprepared from them, with the original plotted detail, as a basis.\r\n\r\n  _Special Survey._\r\n\r\n  A piece of ground, about half a mile in area, is surveyed with minute\r\naccuracy as for some special purpose, and is laid down on a scale\r\nsufficiently large to admit of the calculation of the areas of the\r\nenclosures from the paper. The method followed is the same as that\r\npursued on the Ordnance Survey, and with the Tithe Commutation Surveys,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n  _Contouring._--On the ground thus specially surveyed contours are\r\ntraced instrumentally at given vertical distances apart and are plotted\r\non the plan.\r\n\r\n  _Military Reconnaissance._\r\n\r\n  This is conducted on principles similar to those which govern the\r\noperations of the general survey; the instruments employed, however, are\r\nall portable. The measurement of a base is made by such means as readily\r\noffer themselves (generally by pacing), and the trigonometrical points\r\nare fixed simply by protracting angles observed with a box sextant or\r\ncompass. The whole of the remaining features and details considered\r\nnecessary in a military point of view are sketched in with the aid of\r\nbearings and pacing. The reconnaissance embraces about six square miles.\r\n\r\n  In addition to the topographical sketch of the ground, each officer\r\nsends in a detailed report of its general character, its resources, and\r\nmilitary capabilities. Each officer also makes a hasty reconnaissance of\r\na road with a view to its employment as a military communication. All\r\nthe information which can be obtained as to the character of the\r\ncountry through which it passes, and towns and villages near it,\r\ntogether with the construction, gradients, etc., of the road, are noted\r\non the face of the sketch.\r\n\r\n  _Fortification Branch._\r\n\r\n  Every officer is required, in this branch of the survey course, to\r\ndesign one or more works of defence for the occupation of a site, of\r\nwhich a contoured plan is furnished to him.\r\n\r\n  In performing this exercise the officer becomes, expert in reading the\r\nvarious forms and slopes of ground, as expressed by contours; he meets\r\nwith and learns to provide for some of the many modifications of the\r\nconditions of defence which the occupation of irreglar sites\r\nnecessitates, and he acquires facility in the application of descriptive\r\ngeometry to the determination of the planes of defilade and the several\r\nplanes of a work.\r\n\r\n  The data upon, which, the design, is framed consist of a plan of\r\nground shown by contours and of some of the conditions to be filled by\r\nthe proposed fortification, such as the objects for which; the site is\r\noccupied, the strength of the garrison, the extent, of the works, the\r\nnature of the defence of the ditches, the trace, or the, profile to be\r\nadopted, etc.\r\n\r\n  On the completion of his design the officer writes a report\r\nexplanatory of the character of the works, he has adopted, and\r\ndescribing his arrangements both for the distant and near defence, with\r\nany improvements which have suggested themselves in working it out; and\r\nsince the scale of the design, admits of considerable accuracy in its\r\npreparation, he is required to enter very fully into the detail of the\r\narrangement he proposes.\r\n\r\n  The report is accompanied by tables showing how the remblai and deblai\r\nare equalized, and that the distribution of the latter is, economical.\r\n\r\n  _Civil Applications._\r\n\r\n  _Projects for a line of communication, general plan, and trial\r\nsections._--The officers are instructed in the general principles which\r\nshould guide them in laying out lines of communication, whether by road,\r\nrailway, or canal, and are then sent out to examine the country between\r\ntwo points five or six miles apart, and are required to decide on two or\r\nmore routes which apparently offer the greatest facilities in point of\r\ngradients, soil, and the materials of construction. Availing themselves\r\nof the best map or plan they can obtain, they draw a plan showing\r\napproximately the divisions of the properties through which the trial\r\nlines are run; they then make trial sections; and from these sections\r\nand their previous examination of the ground, they determine on the\r\nline, to be adopted, embodying in a report a general description of the\r\ncountry, the obstacles encountered on each route, the gradients, curves,\r\netc., and also the calculations which led to their decision. In their\r\ncalculations they estimate the cost of the necessary constructions on\r\neach of the trial lines, the cost of conveyance for heavy goods on an\r\nassumed basis of daily traffic, and the time occupied in each case for\r\nquick transit.\r\n\r\n  _Working plan and section._--A length of one mile of the route\r\ndetermined on as the best is selected, and for this a special survey is\r\nmade, which is laid down as a working plan, the line being picketed out\r\nwhen no objection is made by the owners of the property through which it\r\npasses. A working section of the line is also prepared from accurate\r\nlevels.\r\n\r\n  _Plan of details, etc._--For the works proposed on that portion of the\r\nline Which is, included within the limits of the working section, a plan\r\nof details Is prepared, as well as a specification for the works and an\r\nestimate of their probable cost.\r\n\r\n  II. THE COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION AND ESTIMATING.\r\n\r\n  For this course 142 days, including Sundays, are allowed. The course\r\nis divided into four parts.\r\n\r\n  _Part I--Theory of Construction._\r\n\r\n  This part consists of a series of examples in construction, about 50\r\nin number, which will be varied from time to time.\r\n\r\n  They are drawn up with a special view to the application of the\r\nmathematical knowledge already possessed by the officers to some of the\r\ncases, which they are likely to have to deal with in practice.\r\n\r\n  References are given in the margin of the printed paper of examples to\r\nsome of the many books in which the information, necessary for their\r\nsolution can he found.\r\n\r\n  The instructing officer will explain every morning, except Saturday,\r\nas many of the examples as he considers the officers can work during the\r\nremainder of the day, and the officers are expected to study these\r\nsubjects from some one of the books referred to.\r\n\r\n  The object of these short explanations is twofold: 1st, to explain the\r\nprinciples on which the particular cases or similar cases are to be\r\ndealt with; 2d, to impart in a condensed form some of the varied\r\ninformation which is familiar to all engineers of experience, but which\r\nan engineer at the commencement of his career often has a difficulty in\r\nfinding.\r\n\r\n  The officers will take notes of these explanations, and write each\r\nmorning notes at the head of the fair copy of the examples, to which\r\nthey refer. The examples explained on each day are to be worked out on\r\nthat day in the fullest manner; the reasoning of each step is to be\r\nstated, and all rough calculations are to be left on the paper, so as to\r\nlessen as much as possible the labor of examination. They are to be\r\nbrought to the instructing officer the following morning, and after\r\nexamination are to be written out fair on ruled foolscap,\r\nquarter-margin, on the right-hand sheet, with explanatory diagrams to a\r\nlarge scale, where necessary, on the left-hand sheet.\r\n\r\n  The fair notes of each week’s work must be sent in before the end of\r\nthe following week.\r\n\r\n  The weights, strength of materials, and other information, will be\r\nfound in the printed tables.\r\n\r\n  This part of the course occupies about 40 days, and while it continues\r\nleave will be granted on Saturdays and Sundays only.\r\n\r\n  _Part II.--Materials._\r\n\r\n  The object of this part of the course is to give the officers some\r\nsort of guide in judging of the quality of the principal materials which\r\nthey will have to use, as well as to afford them information as to the\r\nparticular material most suitable for a building or engineering work.\r\n\r\n  It may be subdivided into three parts, viz., lectures given by\r\nprofessors in the lecture theatre; lectures given by the instructing\r\nofficer; and visits made by the officers to lime works, cement works,\r\nbrickfields, etc.\r\n\r\n  The lectures in the lecture theatre are delivered at the periods most\r\nconvenient to the lecturer, but the notes taken by the officers form\r\npart of this course, and will be bound up with the rest of the papers.\r\n\r\n  The notes of the lectures delivered by the instructing officer are to\r\nbe written out fair immediately after the lecture, in accordance with\r\nthe instructions given, and brought to, the instructing officer on the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\n  A printed paper detailing the particular points to which officers\r\nvisiting manufacturing works are to direct their attention will be given\r\nto each officer, and a report is to be sent in as soon as possible after\r\neach visit to the instructing officer.\r\n\r\n  Sketches to illustrate the lectures and visits are to be as numerous\r\nand complete as possible.\r\n\r\n  The value of these sketches for future reference, and as aids to\r\nofficers in their professional constructions hereafter, will be very\r\nmuch enhanced by having the dimensions clearly written on them, which\r\nshould include at least those of all principal parts of machines and\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\n  This part of the course occupies about three weeks, inclusive of the\r\ntime required to visit the works referred to.\r\n\r\n  The officers will also be instructed, after they leave the course of\r\nconstruction, in the method of testing the quality of some of the\r\nmaterials by chemical analysis, for which a fortnight is allowed.\r\n\r\n  _Part III.--Valuation and Measurement of Work._\r\n\r\n  This part of the course will occupy in all about 37 days, and will\r\ncommence with a series of lectures, the subject matter of which will be\r\nfound chiefly in the printed “Notes on the Practice of Building” and\r\n“Notes on the Building Trades.” They will comprise, in separate lectures\r\nfor each trade,--\r\n\r\n  1. The materials, tools, etc., and apparatus employed, together with\r\ntheir application to the different kinds of work produced.\r\n\r\n  2. The technical terms in vogue.\r\n\r\n  3. The general practice of measuring and valuing.\r\n\r\n  Hints and memoranda useful in designing, estimating, and carrying out\r\nworks will be given, and explanations afforded by reference to models\r\nand drawings, from some of which colored sketches, with the names and\r\ndimensions of the different parts given on them in full, will be made by\r\neach officer and attached to his printed notes. These sketches will be\r\ndone in the Hall of Study from the originals deposited there.\r\n\r\n  A lecture will be given explaining the different steps taken in\r\npreparing the annual estimates of a district, to be laid before\r\nParliament, and the various methods of carrying out the services which\r\nmay be authorized.\r\n\r\n  The cost of a building will be approximately estimated by cubing it\r\nout from the general plans and elevations.\r\n\r\n  The quantities of the same building will then be taken out from the\r\nspecifications, working drawings, and a model, by filling in a\r\nmeasurement form having the details of work done printed on it.\r\n\r\n  Details and estimates of the same building will be made out on W.O.\r\nForm 1554, the items and prices being taken from the W.D. Schedules of\r\nthe district, and the descriptive part printed on.\r\n\r\n  Lastly, the quantities will be abstracted and brought into bill, as\r\nthough the work were to be put up to tender, or as would be done in\r\ndrawing out contractors’ bills for work to be paid for on a schedule of\r\nprices.\r\n\r\n  The portions of the copper plates to be colored will be partly done in\r\nthe course of lectures, but about a week at the close of this part of\r\nthe course will be allowed to complete the whole. They are to be colored\r\nin the Hall of Study from pattern drawings deposited there. No drawing\r\nwhatever to be removed from the Hall of Study.\r\n\r\n  _Part IV.--Design._\r\n\r\n  At the commencement of this part of the course each officer will read\r\nthrough the “Notes on Military Buildings,” by Colonel Collinson, Royal\r\nEngineers, studying more particularly the parts which have special\r\nreference to his own design. The lithographed drawings which accompany\r\nthem are not intended to be models to be copied from, but are given as\r\nexamples of works executed, many of which with the advance of sanitary\r\nscience have become obsolete as a whole. They contain many useful\r\ndetails still applicable.\r\n\r\n  The design is intended to afford to each officer an opportunity of\r\napplying the knowledge he may have acquired in the course to some case\r\nwhich he may actually hereafter have to deal with.\r\n\r\n  About six weeks are available for this part of the course, and the\r\nconditions under which the design is to be made will be furnished to\r\neach officer.\r\n\r\n  As a rule the design will consist of a general plan and report, with\r\nsome part worked out in detail, this part being specified for and\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\n  The drawings are to be prepared in accordance with the instructions\r\ndeposited in the Hall of Study.\r\n\r\n  _Tour Reports and Lectures._\r\n\r\n  All tour reports and lectures pertaining to the course of construction\r\nwill be written in accordance with the general regulations for reports,\r\nthat is to say, on foolscap paper, quarter margin, on both sides of the\r\npaper, divided into paragraphs, with headings in the margin, and signed\r\nand dated by the officer. They will form part of Part II. of the course,\r\nand will be bound in the proper places.\r\n\r\n  In writing tour reports and lectures the object should be to condense\r\nas much practical information and fact into as small a space as possible\r\nwithout abbreviating the language or omitting any of the facts. Sketches\r\nshould be made by hand, approximately to scale, but should be clear, and\r\ncontain full dimensions. Statistical and tabular information should be\r\ngiven in full.\r\n\r\n  For the tour report each officer will receive a statement of the\r\nparticulars of each work he has to report on.\r\n\r\n  _Binding._\r\n\r\n  The whole of the notes, etc., of each officer will be bound in one or\r\nmore volumes. Therefore, before leaving the establishment, each officer\r\nshould arrange his notes in the order in which he wishes them bound.\r\n\r\n  III.--FIELD WORK COURSE.\r\n\r\n  The time allowed for this course is 122 days, including Sundays. While\r\non it officers may be required to attend drill one day in each week, and\r\nalso brigade field days.\r\n\r\n  The course comprises instruction in all those duties (with the\r\nexceptions mentioned below) which devolve upon the Royal Engineers when\r\nemployed with an army engaged offensively or defensively, either at a\r\nsiege or in the field.\r\n\r\n  The exceptions are surveying, reconnaissance, telegraphy, firing mines\r\nby electricity, etc., torpedoes, and demolition of permanent works; on\r\nall which subjects instruction is given to the officers while on other\r\ncourses.\r\n\r\n  The officers are required to read carefully the notes on field work\r\ninstruction, to make models in sand, etc., of such works as admit of\r\nthis practice, to take part in the construction of the several works in\r\nthe field, etc., and to draw up projects on the subject.\r\n\r\n  Before leaving the course an officer must be competent to impart\r\ninstruction to sappers in all their field duties.\r\n\r\n  The practical instruction is divided into seven parts.\r\n\r\n  _Part I.--Modelling in Sand, etc._\r\n\r\n  This part consists of making models of gabions, fascines, hurdles, and\r\nsap-rollers; of throwing up models in sand of portions of a first\r\nparallel and its approaches, of a second parallel, of single and double\r\nsaps, both kneeling and standing, of a trench cavalier, of a lodgment by\r\nhalf double sap, of rifle-pits, and of trons-de-loup.\r\n\r\n  Also of making models in sand of field powder magazines, and of\r\nelevated, sunken, half sunken, and screen, gun and mortar batteries\r\n(ordinary and indented), revetted with gabions, fascines, and sand bags.\r\n\r\n  It includes the laying of model gun and mortar platforms, the making\r\nof a salient of a field redoubt, with gun en barbette, of a field\r\nkitchen, and of the passage of a wet ditch by means of gabions and\r\nfascines.\r\n\r\n  Also the erection of spar bridges of different forms with model spars,\r\nand the laying in of a cross-over road to connect two lines of railway.\r\n\r\n  _Part II.--Siege Works._\r\n\r\n  This part consists of making gabions, fascines, hurdles, and\r\nsap-rollers; of tracing (part by night) parallels, approaches,\r\nbatteries, etc.\r\n\r\n  Also of seeing parallels, approaches, batteries, saps, trench\r\ncavaliers, etc., constructed by the sappers; and the mode of extending\r\nmen and setting them to work.\r\n\r\n  The officers are also required to take up for enfilade the\r\nprolongation of faces, etc.\r\n\r\n  _Part III--Works of Defence._\r\n\r\n  This part consists of instruction in forming abattis, entanglements,\r\nrifle pits, trons-de-loup, etc., and in putting up stockades, palisades,\r\nfraises, etc.\r\n\r\n  _Part IV.--Mining._\r\n\r\n  This part includes boring and blasting rock, sinking shafts, driving\r\ngalleries, making chambers and powder hose, loading, tamping, and firing\r\nmines, also the preparation and firing of fougasses.\r\n\r\n  _Part V.--Bridging._\r\n\r\n  This part includes knotting, splicing, and lashing spars, diving,\r\nrowing in boats, packing pontoons, and forming temporary military\r\nbridges over streams with large and small pontoons, casks, etc.\r\n\r\n  Also the construction of spar, timber, and suspension bridges to\r\nreëstablish a communication by turnpike road or railroad.\r\n\r\n  _Part VI.--Railways._\r\n\r\n  This part consists in seeing the mode of laying down and repairing\r\nlines of railway, and of putting in a cross-over road to connect two\r\nlines of railway, and also the mode of destroying railways.\r\n\r\n  _Part VII.--Sundry Practices._\r\n\r\n  Under this head are included boring for water (with the American tube\r\nwells as well as with the ordinary apparatus), erecting field kitchens,\r\nfilling and throwing hand grenades, and escalading, also the erection of\r\nfield observatories.\r\n\r\n  The officers are, in addition, required to draw up the following\r\nprojects:\r\n\r\n    1. Project of attack of a fortress actually in existence.\r\n    2. Project for the restoration of a bridge.\r\n    3. Project for a floating bridge.\r\n    4. Project for a field work as a bridge-head.\r\n    5. Hasty project for a temporary bridge, or hasty project\r\n       for the demolition of a portion of a line of railway.\r\n\r\n  IV.--MISCELLANEOUS SUBJECTS.\r\n\r\n  (_a._) _Course of Telegraphy.--Fifteen days are allowed for this\r\ncourse_.\r\n\r\n  All officers under instruction learn the theory and practice of\r\ntelegraphy and visual signalling, bearing in mind that a thorough\r\nknowledge of the theory will enable them to overcome difficulties which\r\nwould be perplexing to the men, who can only be expected to learn the\r\npractical working of the telegraph.\r\n\r\n  The various instruments in use for signalling and testing are\r\nexplained to them, and they are taught the ordinary methods of measuring\r\nelectrical forces and resistances, and of testing conducting wires for\r\ninsulation and conductivity, and for determining the nature and\r\npositions of faults. The degree of accuracy which may be attained in\r\nthese measurements is pointed out to them.\r\n\r\n  They learn the European Morse alphabet, and the method of sending and\r\nreceiving messages, but they are not expected to devote so much time to\r\nthe subject as would enable them to become expert telegraphists.\r\n\r\n  Each officer is required to give in a project for the construction of\r\na line of electric telegraph, including at least three stations. In the\r\nreport are described the instruments to be used and the modes of\r\nconnecting them in circuit; the batteries, the conductors, the supports,\r\nthe insulators, and the mode of putting up the line; and the number of\r\ncells required to work the line is calculated.\r\n\r\n  An estimate of the stores and materials required accompanies the\r\nreport, with a general plan showing the route proposed.\r\n\r\n  The various methods of exploding gunpowder by electricity are taught\r\nwhile the course of telegraphy is going on; the application of this\r\nbranch of electrical science is made when the officers are employed on\r\nprojects for demolitions by mining.\r\n\r\n  In the School of Telegraphy a certain number of the men of the corps\r\nare trained every year as telegraphists.\r\n\r\n  The instruments of which the use is taught are.--\r\n\r\n    The single needle instrument worked by voltaic electricity.\r\n    The Morse recording and sounding instrument.\r\n    The double needle instrument.\r\n    Wheatstone’s magneto dial instrument.\r\n    Also day and night signalling with the approved visual apparatus.\r\n\r\n  Each man is required to read a specified number of words per minute,\r\nand to send correctly by each instrument, before he passes on to the\r\nnext.\r\n\r\n  The European Morse alphabet is used with all the instruments, except\r\nwith the double needle instrument, which has a special alphabet.\r\n\r\n  The men are taught how to make up and repair the voltaic batteries and\r\ninstruments, and to put up conducting wires over ground, and to lay them\r\nunderground, and also to test roughly for the position of faults. Their\r\nprevious education does not generally admit of their acquiring a\r\nknowledge of the theory of electricity, or of performing the more\r\ndelicate tests required in telegraphy.\r\n\r\n  The men who enter the Telegraph School are also instructed in the\r\npractical manipulation of Grove’s voltaic batteries, Wheatstone’s\r\nmagnetic exploder, and the dynamo-electric machine, in the use of\r\nfrictional electricity, in making the electrical fuzes, and in\r\nconnecting and arranging the wires necessary for firing mines by\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) _Chemical Laboratory Course.--Fifteen days are allowed for this\r\ncourse_.\r\n\r\n  The object of this course is to enable officers and men at the\r\nestablishment, who may show an inclination for chemical studies, to\r\npursue them practically.\r\n\r\n  The course is confined to the chemical relations and behavior of the\r\nsubstances which affect the qualities of building materials, or which\r\nmay influence the questions which are most likely to require the\r\nprofessional investigation of a military engineer. It is arranged with\r\nthe idea of supplying the want of practical experience in dealing with\r\nsubstances used in construction, by giving an insight into their nature\r\nand composition; and also with that of imparting such information as may\r\nlead in a new colony, should an officer be called upon to act as its\r\nexplorer and pioneer, to a more rapid development of its resources.\r\n\r\n  The course for the officers consists,--\r\n\r\n  1st. In making themselves acquainted with the action of reagents, both\r\nby wet methods and by the blow-pipe, on different simple substances, in\r\nexperiments to which they are directed by a text-book.\r\n\r\n  2d. In applying the information so gained to the qualitative\r\nexamination of substances, simple and compound, specially prepared as\r\nexercises for analysis.\r\n\r\n  3d. In the quantitative as well as qualitative examination of building\r\nstones, lime and cement stones, gypsum, brick earths, paints, solders,\r\nand other building materials. A sample of water is also examined, and a\r\nqualitative examination is made of one or more ores.\r\n\r\n  4th. In preparing, on an experimental scale, bricks, limes, cements,\r\nand plasters, directly from natural stones or earths by simple\r\ncalcination, and also by the more complex method which it is often\r\nnecessary to adopt.\r\n\r\n  5th. The chemistry of the voltaic battery.\r\n\r\n  The course for the men only differs from that for the officers in\r\nrespect of the order in which the several divisions of the subject are\r\ntaken up. The men, instead of commencing with a thorough examination of\r\nnumerous simple substances, begin with a few easy experiments on\r\nrecognizing lime and cement stones, and on the mode of ascertaining\r\ntheir comparative values, so that, in case it is judged inexpedient, in\r\nany instance, that the whole course shall be completed, the knowledge\r\nwhich has been gained may be of a character requiring comparatively\r\nlittle skill and intelligence to apply to practical uses.\r\n\r\n  A certain number of men only are taught.\r\n\r\n  (_c._) _Course of Photography._\r\n\r\n  This study is not compulsory; but any officer and a limited number of\r\nmen who have completed the prescribed course satisfactorily, and who\r\nwish to study photography, are allowed to do so.\r\n\r\n  The officers devote their attention more particularly to the chemical\r\ntheory of the subject, in order that they may be able to overcome the\r\npractical difficulties which constantly occur when this art is pursued\r\nin foreign countries under circumstances of climate and situation\r\ndifferent from those in England, and when chemicals get out of order and\r\nproduce anomalous results. In such cases men who have acquired\r\nconsiderable skill in manipulation, but who have no knowledge of\r\nchemistry, are unable to devise remedies or to overcome difficulties,\r\nand it is the place of their officers to assist them by their superior\r\nknowledge and intelligence.\r\n\r\n  The men are taught the negative wet collodion process in all its\r\nbranches (except the manufacture of pyroxyline), also the dry process,\r\nand photozincography.\r\n\r\n  They are also practised in the use of the dark tent, and in taking\r\nnegatives in the field, and of photographic reductions of plans.\r\n\r\n  It is seldom that their previous education admits of their becoming\r\nwell versed in the chemical theory of the art, but the means of\r\novercoming the usual practical difficulties are pointed out to them.\r\nEach man is required to enter in a note-book the various solutions, and\r\nto make memoranda of the processes.\r\n\r\n  (_d._) _Lectures._\r\n\r\n  Lectures are delivered between the months of September and April on\r\ncivil and mechanical engineering, metallurgy, architecture, electricity\r\nand its applications, and on other subjects of a professional character.\r\nThe lectures are attended by all the officers and men under instruction,\r\nand the former are required to take rough notes, and afterward to write\r\nthem out fairly, for binding with their other work.\r\n\r\n  (_e._) _Visits to Professional Works._\r\n\r\n  With the object of giving an idea of the best methods of carrying on\r\nextensive works, and of imparting practical information on professional\r\nsubjects, a certain number of the junior officers are selected every\r\nyear to visit engineering, architectural, and other works of\r\nprofessional character, accompanied by one of the instructing officers\r\nof the establishment.\r\n\r\n  Of the various constructions and processes seen during these tours\r\nthey make notes and drawings, which are embodied in the form of reports\r\nto the director, and are subsequently bound up with the other parts of\r\nthe course.\r\n\r\n  _General Note._--Further explanations of the mode of filling up the\r\ndetails of the course, and of the forms for the notes and drawings, are\r\ngiven in the special instructions.\r\n\r\n  (_f._) _Demolitions._\r\n\r\n  The ignition of gunpowder or other explosives by powder hose and\r\nBickford’s fuze as well as by electricity, both on land and submerged\r\nunder water, is taught to all officers.\r\n\r\n  In order that the best methods of using gunpowder or other explosives\r\nfor the demolition of works and buildings by mining may be thoroughly\r\nunderstood, each officer is required to make projects for the following\r\ndemolitions, viz.:\r\n\r\n  1. A front of fortification, or some similar work, exhibiting various\r\nsorts of revetments, and requiring the simultaneous explosion of a large\r\nnumber of mines.\r\n\r\n  2. A casemate, powder magazine, or other substantial military building\r\nunder two suppositions: 1st, that there is plenty of time, that\r\nsufficient men and tools are available, and that it is required to\r\neffect complete demolition without wasting gunpowder unnecessarily; 2d,\r\nthat time presses, and that the demolition must be effected in the most\r\nexpeditious manner possible.\r\n\r\n  3. A bridge or viaduct under two different suppositions, as in No. 2.\r\n\r\n  The mines in some cases are directed to be tired by powder hose, and\r\nin others by electricity.\r\n\r\n  Each of these projects consists of a memoir and explanatory drawings.\r\nThe memoir comprises,--\r\n\r\n  1st. A description of the building, or work to be destroyed, in all\r\npoints which may influence the mode of demolition.\r\n\r\n  2d. A general description of the proposed mode of demolition.\r\n\r\n  3d. The calculations for the charges of the mines.\r\n\r\n  4th. The mode of preparing and firing the mines.\r\n\r\n  5th. An estimate of the men, tools, and materials required and of the\r\ntime necessary for the operation.\r\n\r\n  6th. An estimate of the gunpowder.\r\n\r\n  7th. When electricity is to be employed for firing the mines, a full\r\ndescription of the batteries, etc., is given, with calculations of the\r\nnumber of cells, etc.\r\n\r\n  The drawings include a plan and such sections as may be required to\r\nexplain clearly the situations of the various charges of gunpowder, and\r\nof the shafts and galleries.\r\n\r\n  (_g._) _Submarine Mines._\r\n\r\n  All officers and a certain number of men are practised in the use of\r\nsubmarine mines.\r\n\r\n  The course consists of,--\r\n\r\n    1. The nature and construction of case.\r\n\r\n    2. Mode of mooring.\r\n\r\n    3. Mode of arranging and laying insulated cables.\r\n\r\n    4.

Modes of firing at will and by self-acting arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION FOR COMMISSIONED OFFICERS\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\nAlthough examinations preparatory to promotion had been instituted by\r\nthe Duke of Wellington in 1850, no attempt was made to provide any\r\ngeneral machinery for affording to officers of the army means of\r\ninstruction, even in those subjects a knowledge of which was by the\r\nregulations of the service required of them. The Department of Artillery\r\nstudies at Woolwich, originally instituted on a small scale in 1850, and\r\nthe Royal Engineer Establishment at Chatham, supplied to the officers of\r\nthe scientific corps, though to a much more limited extent than at the\r\npresent day, opportunities of carrying on their professional studies\r\nafter entering the army. But to officers of other branches of the\r\nservice no means of instruction were afforded in any subjects beyond the\r\nmere routine of drill and regimental duties, except by the Senior\r\nDepartment at Sandhurst and the School of Musketry at Hythe. The state\r\nof the former institution, the advantages of which extended only to a\r\nvery small proportion of the officers of the army, is described in the\r\naccounts of the Royal Military College and of the Staff College. The\r\nschool at Hythe was first established in the year 1853, for the purpose\r\nof training a certain number of officers and soldiers in the new system\r\nof musketry, which was adopted on the introduction of rifled arms into\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nThe first official suggestion, with the object of remedying the\r\ndeficiency of professional knowledge among the officers of the army, was\r\nmade by Mr. Sidney Herbert, when Secretary at War, in 1854. The outline\r\nof the plan proposed by him at this time was sketched out in a letter\r\naddressed to Lord Hardinge, then Commander-in-Chief, and its details\r\nwere subsequently more fully explained in speeches in the House of\r\nCommons. The scheme contemplated a general reorganization of the system\r\nof military education,--the improvement of the examinations instituted\r\nby the Duke of Wellington for admission to the army and for\r\npromotion,--the conversion of the Senior Department at Sandhurst into a\r\nspecial school for the staff,--and the introduction of a system of\r\nprofessional instruction for officers after entering the service. With\r\nthe view of carrying out the latter part of the scheme, it was proposed,\r\nin 1854, to appoint garrison instructors at certain large stations both\r\nat home and in the colonies. It was not intended to make attendance at\r\nthe instruction thus given compulsory, but a stringent examination in\r\nthe subjects which entered into the course was to be a necessary\r\ncondition of promotion to the ranks of lieutenant and captain\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe scheme of garrison instruction proposed by Mr. Sidney Herbert met\r\nwith the approval of Lord Hardinge, and obtained the sanction of the\r\nTreasury. A sum of 2,000_l._, for the purpose of making a commencement\r\nin carrying it out, was inserted in the estimates for 1854-5, and the\r\nplan, as explained by Mr. Herbert in moving the army estimates, met with\r\nthe entire approval of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the Crimean War, however, in the first instance,\r\ninterfered with the practical realization of the scheme, although it\r\nappears that some of the instructors had been actually selected for\r\ntheir posts, and that it was intended to send them out to the Crimea to\r\nacquire a practical acquaintance with such of the minor operations of\r\nwar as would fall within the intended course of instruction. This latter\r\nintention was not carried out, and after the resignation of Mr. Sidney\r\nHerbert, which took place in the beginning of 1855, no further steps\r\nappear to have been taken in the matter. At the same time money\r\ncontinued to be voted for the purpose of carrying out the scheme\r\n(although no application of the funds was made), until the general\r\nreduction in the estimates which took place on the conclusion of peace\r\nin 1856; it appears also, from statements made by the Under Secretary at\r\nWar, in the House of Commons, that the Government had never abandoned\r\nthe idea of adopting some measure for the professional instruction of\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nIn the debates in both Houses of Parliament, during the Crimean War,\r\nnumerous discussions took place on the subject of military education;\r\nthe failure of the existing examinations for promotion, the lax mode in\r\nwhich they were carried out, the want of acquaintance with many of the\r\nmere rudiments of military science displayed by the majority of\r\nofficers, and the necessity of supplying them with some means of\r\ninstruction in the practical duties devolving upon them on active\r\nservice, formed frequent subjects of remark. On the 5th of June, 1856,\r\nafter the termination of the war, Mr. Sidney Herbert, then a private\r\nmember, again brought his proposal for the appointment of garrison\r\ninstructors before the notice of the House of Commons, in connection\r\nwith his more general scheme for the improvement of the education of\r\nofficers; but, although the proposal again met with the approval of\r\nnearly every speaker who took part in the discussion, the Government\r\ndeclined to pledge themselves to the adoption of the scheme in its\r\ndetails, as the question of the reorganization of the whole system of\r\nmilitary education was then under consideration.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the year 1856, as has been elsewhere stated,\r\nthe attention of the military authorities was seriously directed to the\r\nquestion of improving the education of the army. Nearly all the plans\r\nsubmitted to Lord Panmure with this object included, as an essential\r\nfeature, the adoption of some means of professional instruction for\r\nofficers after entering the service; and the machinery suggested was, in\r\nalmost every case, based in its general principles on Mr. Sidney\r\nHerbert’s original proposal for the establishment of garrison\r\ninstructors. The Commissioners appointed in the same year to visit the\r\nmilitary schools of the continent, while their inquiries were chiefly\r\nconfined to the improvement of the education of the scientific corps,\r\nrecommended in their report that young officers of all branches of the\r\nservice should, after entering the army, go through some course of\r\nprofessional study; at the same time they suggested no machinery for\r\ncarrying their recommendation into effect. The military witnesses\r\nexamined, during the years 1856 and 1857, before the Royal Commission on\r\nthe Purchase System, very generally concurred in the opinion that higher\r\nprofessional acquirements should be demanded from officers, and that\r\nmeans of instruction should be afforded to them; and the Commissioners,\r\nin their Report, endorsed this view in the following terms: “Nor can it\r\nbe fairly said that the purchase system is the obstacle to introducing a\r\nbetter system of military education. A stricter examination before\r\ngranting the first commission, an improved training afterward, and a\r\nfurther examination on promotion from ensign to lieutenant, are measures\r\nperfectly compatible with the system of purchase.”\r\n\r\nThe system of garrison instruction suggested by Mr. Sidney Herbert\r\nappears to have found general favor at this period. The instructions\r\nissued to the Council of Military Education, on their appointment in\r\n1857, directed them, in connection with the subject of the professional\r\nexamination of officers up to the rank of captain, to consider the\r\nquestion “of the establishment of instructors at the large stations.”\r\nThe plan proposed by the Council, in 1857, did not contemplate the\r\ngeneral appointment of either garrison or regimental instructors; its\r\nmain feature was the establishment of officers’ schools at depot\r\nbattalion stations, through which all young officers, who were in the\r\nfirst instance to receive provisional commissions, should pass before\r\njoining their regiments and being permanently commissioned. This\r\nrecommendation was supplemented by one for the partial establishment of\r\ndistrict instructors at stations where classes of ten officers could be\r\nformed, for the more advanced instruction of those who had been some\r\nyears in the service.\r\n\r\nThe great demand for officers occasioned by the Indian mutiny, combined\r\nwith practical objections which were made to the Council’s scheme,\r\nprevented their proposals from being carried into effect. The only\r\nimmediate result of their recommendations was the establishment, in\r\n1857, of a class at Aldershot for the instruction of officers quartered\r\nat the camp in military sketching. A full account of this institution,\r\nwhich has since been considerably developed, and is now called the\r\nSurvey Class, will be found further on.\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent period the attention of the Council appears to have been\r\ndirected more to the question of securing the professional competence of\r\nofficers by a special military education before entering the service,\r\nthan by compulsory instruction at a later period. The proposal,\r\noriginally made in 1858, for requiring all candidates for commissions in\r\nthe line to pass through Sandhurst, has been already described in\r\nconnection with the Royal Military College. The Council have, however,\r\nnever ceased to urge the expediency of providing officers, after they\r\nhave entered the service, with facilities for instruction in the higher\r\nbranches of military science; and in their last General Report they\r\nrecommended the establishment of institutions similar to the Aldershot\r\nSurvey Class at other large stations.\r\n\r\nAlthough no general machinery has been introduced for affording\r\ninstruction to officers of the cavalry and infantry after entering the\r\nservice, various steps have, from time to time, been taken with the\r\nobject of extending their professional knowledge to subjects beyond the\r\nmere routine duties of their own arms. In January, 1859, commanding\r\nofficers were directed to require from the officers of their regiments\r\nreports and, if possible, sketches of the roads traversed when route\r\nmarching in winter; and later in the same year an order was issued that\r\nofficers of infantry should, whenever practicable, be instructed in\r\ngreat gun drill. In the present year a system of instruction in military\r\nsignalling has been introduced at the School of Engineering at Chatham,\r\nto which detachments of officers are periodically sent. In addition to\r\nthe recommendations of the present Royal Commission for the introduction\r\nof a system of garrison and regimental instruction, the Royal Commission\r\non Courts-martial, in their recent Report, recommended that more\r\nattention should be paid to the education of officers in military law,\r\nand that stricter examinations in the subject should be enforced.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of an improvement in the professional acquirements of\r\nofficers appears to have been almost universally recognized from the\r\ntime when Mr. Sidney Herbert brought the subject to public notice in\r\n1854. Various opinions, however, have been entertained as to the means\r\nby which the desired object could best be effected.\r\n\r\nThe different plans which have from time to time been suggested may be\r\nclassified under two main divisions:\r\n\r\n(1.) Those which propose a special military education for all candidates\r\nfor commissions before entering the service.\r\n\r\n(2.) Those which advocate, in preference, the postponement of\r\nprofessional instruction, at least for the majority of the officers of\r\nthe army, until a later period, after the service has been entered, and\r\nthe rank of officer been attained.\r\n\r\nUnder the former head comes the scheme suggested by the Council of\r\nMilitary Education in 1858, the adoption of which was at one time\r\ndetermined upon by the military authorities, for requiring all\r\ncandidates for commissions in the cavalry and infantry to pass through\r\nSandhurst. A similar proposal was suggested by witnesses to the Royal\r\nCommission on the Purchase System in 1856; it was supported by the\r\nauthority of the Duke of Cambridge and Mr. Sidney Herbert (who had\r\noriginally been opposed to it) before the Select Committee of the House\r\nof Commons on Military Organization, in 1860; and the Committee, in\r\ntheir Report, though declining to pronounce any decided opinion on the\r\nsubject, stated that they considered the measure “well worthy of the\r\nmost careful consideration.” Of late years the same principle has been\r\npublicly advocated by Sir C. Trevelyan, who considers that there should\r\nbe but two modes of admission to the rank of officer,--one through a\r\nmilitary college, and the other by serving in the ranks; and the\r\nadvantages which would result from passing all candidates for\r\ncommissions through a military college have been urged by several\r\nwitnesses, including His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, before\r\nthe present Royal Commission. On the other hand, opponents of this view\r\nhave pointed out the objections entertained by them to any such measure.\r\n\r\nAllied to the plan for making a military college the sole channel of\r\nadmission to the commissioned ranks of the army is one for requiring all\r\ncandidates for commissions to serve as cadets, in order to acquire a\r\npractical acquaintance with their duties, before obtaining the rank of\r\nofficer. This proposal, originally suggested by Lord Clyde, before the\r\nRoyal Commission on the Purchase System, has more recently been\r\nsupported by the authority of Sir W. Mansfield and Lord De la Warr; the\r\nlatter officer, however, appears of late to have somewhat modified his\r\nviews, and to advocate at present, for all young men who obtain direct\r\ncommissions by purchase, a probationary course of six or twelve months’\r\ninstruction in military subjects and drill, at their parents’ expense,\r\nprior to joining their regiments, in accordance with a plan submitted to\r\nthe Commission. The cadet system has also been advocated by Lord Walden\r\nbefore the Commission.\r\n\r\nTo the class of plans which advocate the postponement of professional\r\ninstruction for the majority of the officers of the army until after the\r\nservice has been entered, belong Mr. Sidney Herbert’s original proposal,\r\nin 1854, for the introduction of a system of garrison instruction--the\r\nrecommendation of the Commissioners of 1856 “that young officers after\r\nentering the army should go through some course of professional\r\nstudy,”--the suggestion made by the Royal Commission on the Purchase\r\nSystem for “an improved system of training after the first commission is\r\ngranted,”--and the proposal of the Council of Military Education, in\r\n1857, for the establishment of depot battalion schools for young\r\nofficers. Opinions founded on the same principle have been expressed by\r\nseveral witnesses before the present Commission. The system of garrison\r\ninstructors at large stations, that of regimental instructors in each\r\ncorps, and, lastly, a combination of both systems, have been\r\nrespectively advocated by various authorities as the machinery by which\r\nthe later instruction of officers should be carried out. Even those who\r\nadvocate a special education at a military college as the universal\r\ncondition of obtaining a commission do not, in the majority of cases,\r\ncontemplate the cessation of all instruction on the commission being\r\nobtained; at the same time in many instances they do not consider that\r\nthis later instruction should be made compulsory on officers, and, while\r\nrecommending that facilities should be afforded for it, they maintain\r\nthe superior efficacy of a system of preliminary military education at\r\nan earlier age.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. SURVEY CLASS AT ALDERSHOT.\r\n\r\nThe survey class at Aldershot originated in an order of the\r\nQuartermaster-General in 1857, appointing two extra deputy-assistants to\r\nafford professional instruction to officers of the division stationed\r\nthere in military sketching and surveying, field and permanent\r\nfortification, and photography.\r\n\r\nThese courses and conditions of attendance are as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. An elementary course comprises practical geometry, so far as is\r\nnecessary for the understanding of the principles of surveying and\r\nfortification, plan drawing, the construction and use of scales, and\r\nmilitary sketching.\r\n\r\n  The other course embraces surveying in its more advanced branches,\r\nmilitary reconnaissances and road reports, field fortification,\r\nincluding the attack and defence of small posts, the construction of\r\nsimple intrenchments, redoubts, and field works, profiling and tracing\r\non the ground, gabion and fascine making, camping, and the construction\r\nof field ovens and cook-houses.\r\n\r\n  2. Officers will not be allowed to go through the course of\r\ninstruction unless their commanding officer will certify that they are\r\nintelligent, zealous, and well conducted; but considering that the stay\r\nof regiments at this camp is frequently limited, the Lieutenant-General\r\nCommanding would wish that every facility should be given to officers to\r\navail themselves of the instruction, even though they may not be\r\nthoroughly acquainted, with all their duties.\r\n\r\n  3. Every officer wishing to attend the course of instruction will\r\nsubmit his application to his commanding officer, who will forward it\r\nwith his recommendation and the certificate mentioned in the last\r\nparagraph, or with such remarks as he may have to offer, should he\r\nconsider it his duty not to recommend the application.\r\n\r\n  4. Officers going through the elementary course will be struck off all\r\nduty for two months (Sundays excepted). They will go on flying columns.\r\n\r\n  5. Officers anxious to attend the second course will be allowed to do\r\nso for four months, during which time they will take all regimental\r\nduties which would entail extra work on the other officers, but will be\r\nexcused all brigade and divisional duties, except those mentioned in\r\nparagraph 7.\r\n\r\n  6. Officers permitted to attend are not to absent themselves without\r\nleave from the Lieutenant-General commanding.\r\n\r\n  7. Officers are to be present at divisional field days, and when the\r\ndivision marches into the country during the winter months, either with\r\nthe deputy assistants quartermaster-general sketching the ground, noting\r\nthe movements, preparing reports, etc. (in undress, without swords), or\r\nif not so employed they are to fall in with their respective corps.\r\n\r\n  8. The number of officers attending is restricted to two per regiment.\r\n\r\n  9. The instruction will extend from 10 A.M. till 1 P.M., excepting on\r\nSaturdays, when all the officers will attend till 12 only.\r\n\r\n  10. Staff officers who may wish to avail themselves of the instruction\r\ngiven at the Survey Office, or in the field, may attend at such hours as\r\nthe nature of the duties they have to perform will admit.\r\n\r\n  11. Officers of the division generally will be assisted by the\r\nD.A.Q.M.G.s as far as practicable, in pursuing their studies in other\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n  12. A diary will be kept showing the names of all officers attending,\r\nthe hours of attendance, the work done, etc.; this diary is to be\r\nsubmitted for the inspection of the Lieutenant-General commanding, and\r\nfrom it a monthly report will be prepared for the information of the\r\nField Marshal.\r\n\r\n  13. Officers will be allowed the use of surveying instruments but will\r\nhave to provide their own drawing and other materials. They will,\r\nhowever, be permitted to retain all sketches, plans, and reports thus\r\nmade on their own materials, after they have been returned from the\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nThe course actually carried out in 1868-69 was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Explanation, use, and construction of scales--several examples worked\r\nand a plate of scales drawn--mode of using the usual drawing\r\ninstruments, protractors, and Marquois’ scales.\r\n\r\n  Use of the prismatic compass--a road is traversed with the\r\ncompass--bearings and measurements entered in a field-book, and the\r\nresult plotted indoors on a large scale.\r\n\r\n  A plate of the conventional signs used by the topographical\r\ndepartment, and a set of the seven examples of shading ground (by the\r\nlate Major Petley), according to the latest scale of shade, are given to\r\neach officer to copy.\r\n\r\n  The general principles of plan drawing, and the mode of conducting a\r\nsurvey by means of measuring a base, and by a triangulation, are\r\nexplained, and a flat piece of ground is sketched with the compass, and\r\nplotted in the field.\r\n\r\n  The method of representing ground by contours only is now explained\r\nand illustrated by models, drawings, etc., and it is shown how from a\r\ncontoured plan sections and elevations of ground are made, also how by\r\nadding shade to the contoured plan, a certain pictorial effect is\r\nproduced, etc.\r\n\r\n  Abney’s pocket level and clinometer is explained, and various modes of\r\nrough levelling illustrated.\r\n\r\n  The method of using the pocket sextant is next shown, and the officers\r\nare taken to a plateau with strongly marked slopes, a base is measured,\r\ntriangulation made by means of the sextant; and the artificial features\r\nfilled in.\r\n\r\n  Contours at 25 feet vertically apart are now sketched in chain dotted\r\nlines, and several sectional lines taken by means of the level,\r\nclinometer, compass, and a scale of hypothenuses, and the various angles\r\nof inclination written on the sketch. The scale of shade is explained,\r\nand the officers taught how to apply it to the sketch of ground so\r\ncontoured, and the sketch finished up as directed in the memorandum by\r\nthe Council of Military Education.\r\n\r\n  Major-General Napier’s pamphlet on reconnaissance is given to each\r\nofficer, and four or five miles of road reconnoitred, sketched, and\r\nreported on.\r\n\r\n  A sketch on a small scale of as large a tract of country as time and\r\nweather will permit of is next made, triangulation done with the sextant\r\nor theodolite, and lastly, a rapid eye-sketch, without instruments, of\r\nsome hilly ground.\r\n\r\n  Some work on field fortification, chiefly the chapters describing the\r\ndefence of buildings, villages, and positions, also some work on\r\nsurveying, is read.\r\n\r\n  At the conclusion of each course all sketches and reports, with a\r\nreturn showing the number of hours’ attendance of each officer, his\r\nattention and progress, are forwarded to the Council of Military\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANCED CLASS FOR ARTILLERY OFFICERS AT WOOLWICH.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of more advanced attainments both in the science and\r\npractice of gunnery was pointed out by the Commissioners in 1856, but\r\nnothing was done till Colonel Lefroy urged the matter on the Council of\r\nMilitary Education in 1862, and in November, 1863, regulations were\r\nissued for the establishment of Advanced Classes of Artillery Officers\r\nat Woolwich.\r\n\r\n  A Director of Artillery Studies was first appointed in 1850, upon the\r\nrecommendation of Field-Marshal Sir Hew Ross, G.C.B., R.A. (then\r\nAdjutant-General of Artillery). His duties were to take charge of and\r\ndirect the studies of the young officers of artillery on first joining\r\nat Woolwich, to assist them in their professional pursuits, and read\r\nwith them military law, military history, treatises on artillery,\r\nfortification, etc.\r\n\r\n  The appointment was made provisionally in the first instance, but\r\nconfirmed before the close of a year. In April, 1853, the department was\r\nincreased by the addition of French and German masters, who, besides\r\nassisting the young officers, were called upon to afford instruction in\r\ntheir respective languages to officers of artillery of all ranks who\r\nmight be desirous of profiting by it.\r\n\r\n  An allowance of 300_l._ per annum was also made to enable a proportion\r\nof the more intelligent of the young officers to accompany the Director\r\nin visits to arsenals and fortresses abroad and manufacturing districts\r\nat home.\r\n\r\n  In July, 1855, the Director of Artillery Studies was allowed the\r\nfollowing assistants: 2 Captains of Artillery, 1 Instructor in\r\nSurveying, 1 Instructor in Military Drawing, etc., 1 Lecturer on Natural\r\nPhilosophy and Mechanics, 3 Non-commissioned officers, for the purpose\r\nof giving instruction to certain gentlemen provisionally commissioned\r\nfrom public colleges or schools after a competitive examination, but\r\nwithout passing through the Academy.\r\n\r\n  The Director was expected to advise and assist the efforts of officers\r\nof the Royal Artillery in improving their professional qualifications,\r\nand to arrange classes of officers for instruction in chemistry,\r\nphotography, drawing, French, and German, at the Royal Artillery\r\nInstitution. He was to inform himself of all the more interesting\r\nexperiments under the Ordnance Select Committee, as well as the\r\noperations and processes carried on in the Government manufacturing\r\ndepartments. He was to arrange and conduct the annual military tour on\r\nthe continent; and direct the studies of young officers.\r\n\r\n  Upon the formation of the Advanced Class in 1864, the staff was\r\ngreatly increased, and an Assistant Director appointed, to take charge\r\nin the absence of the Director; to give instruction to classes of\r\nofficers of the regiment sent to Woolwich from time to time, to officers\r\nfrom the Staff College, and to Militia and Volunteer artillery officers;\r\nto prepare questions for the examination of subaltern officers Royal\r\nArtillery for promotion, and report on the results of such examinations;\r\nto attend on foreigners of distinction, and other duties performed by\r\nthe Director prior to the formation of the Advanced Class.\r\n\r\n  The following shows the attendance for the year ending 31st March,\r\n1869:\r\n\r\n    Advanced class of artillery officers,    6     2 years’  course.\r\n    Firemasters’ class, R.A.,                7     9 months’ course.\r\n    3 short course classes,                           “        “\r\n      {  Royal Artillery,                   29 }   2  “        “\r\n      {  Military Store Staff,               8 }\r\n    Shoeburyness gunnery class, R.A.,       20     3  “        “\r\n    Officers of the late Indian brigades,    3\r\n      { 1 for 3  months’ course; 2 for 2 months’ course.\r\n    Officers from the Staff College,        13     1½ months’ course.\r\n    Militia artillery officers,              6     2       “        “\r\n    Volunteer artillery officers,            2\r\n                                            --  Total, 94\r\n\r\n  _Non-commissioned Officers and Men, Royal Artillery._\r\n\r\n    2 long course classes,\r\n      non-commissioned officers,            19    6 months’ course.\r\n    10 short course classes,\r\n      non-commissioned officers and men,   200    2    “      “\r\n    Shoeburyness gunnery class,\r\n      non-commissioned officers,            36    3    “     “\r\n                                           ---  Total, 255\r\n\r\n  The young officers lately joined attend here twice a week to receive\r\ninstruction, by lectures, from the Assistant Director of Artillery\r\nStudies on military law, courts-martial, and interior economy.\r\n\r\nREGULATIONS FOR ADMISSION IN 1869.\r\n\r\nThe examination will be early in February of each year, at Woolwich,\r\nunder the Council of Military Education.\r\n\r\n  Candidates for this examination must have undergone a course of\r\ninstruction at Shoeburyness; or they must pass satisfactorily a\r\npreliminary examination in practical artillery.\r\n\r\n  No officer will be admitted who will not have completed six years’\r\nservice on 31st March, 1870.\r\n\r\n  The subjects in which the candidates will be examined, and the\r\nrelative importance attached to the subjects, are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Mathematics,                        700\r\n    Chemistry and physics,              300\r\n\r\n  _Mathematics_ includes--\r\n\r\n  Plane trigonometry (so much of it as is included in the first 16\r\nchapters of Todhunter’s treatise).\r\n\r\n  Coördinate geometry of two dimensions (Hymer or Todhunter), viz.:\r\n\r\n  Straight line referred to rectangular, oblique, and polar coördinates.\r\nThe circle, parabola, ellipse, and hyperbola, referred to rectangular\r\nand polar coördinates.

The practice was, however, at that time confined to experiments,\r\nwhich were conducted on a very limited scale, under the department of\r\nthe Director-General of Artillery. A battery was constructed and some\r\nwooden huts erected at the station in that year; but for several years\r\nnothing but experimental practice was carried on by batteries of\r\nartillery who were sent to Shoeburyness merely for the summer months,\r\nand were quartered, at least partially, under canvas. No permanent staff\r\nwere employed, the senior officer present with the troops being in\r\ncommand of the station. In 1854 the establishment assumed a more\r\npermanent character, and was placed under a lieutenant-colonel of\r\nartillery as commandant, who was also at the same time superintendent of\r\nexperiments. It still, however, continued to be merely a station for\r\nartillery practice and experiments, until 1859.\r\n\r\nThe objects for which the School of Gunnery was established are to\r\nensure a completeness and uniformity in the instruction of the officers\r\nand men of the Royal Artillery in the use of the weapons and military\r\nmachines they are called upon to use; impart to them a knowledge of the\r\nammunition, stores, and appliances made use of in the artillery service;\r\nof the effect of shot and shell under various circumstances; and, by\r\nconstant practice from guns of every description, to train and educate\r\nfrom year to year a number of officers and men who would carry with them\r\nto their respective brigades an amount of valuable knowledge and\r\nexperience which would become in that way, and in due time, diffused\r\nthroughout the Royal Artillery, in the same manner as the gunnery\r\ninstruction for the Royal Navy on board the “Excellent,” and the\r\nmusketry instruction for the infantry at Hythe have percolated with such\r\nadvantage through those services.\r\n\r\nOn the first of April in each year a class of from 20 to 25 officers is\r\nformed for what is termed a “long course,” embracing a period of 12\r\nmonths; and a class of about 40 non-commissioned officers, for a similar\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThese classes are formed into two separate squads, and entirely occupy\r\nthe time of the chief instructor, one gunnery instructor, and four\r\nassistant instructors. They are instructed in the drills and exercises\r\nof every species of ordnance, and the mode of mounting and dismounting\r\nthem under various circumstances and with different means; in\r\ntransporting the heaviest guns from place to place and mounting them\r\nunder difficulties; in making rafts; embarking and disembarking guns;\r\nmaking up ammunition; preparing demands for stores; carrying on gun\r\npractice with shot, shell, etc.; making signals; throwing up batteries\r\nas at a siege, and afterward testing their efficiency by firing at them;\r\nattending lectures on artillery subjects by the officers instructing the\r\nclasses, and on subjects of a scientific nature, and bearing upon the\r\nscience of artillery, by professional gentlemen engaged from time to\r\ntime for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe non-commissioned officers attend these latter lectures, and also\r\nreceive from the schoolmaster, under the direction of the officer in\r\ncharge of the class (and with great advantage), instruction in\r\nmathematics, and in mechanical drawing applicable to the course they are\r\nbeing carried through.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these “long courses,” as they are termed, another class\r\nof 33 non-commissioned officers is sent every three months to go through\r\nwhat is termed a “short course,” for the purpose of being instructed in\r\nthe various duties connected with the service, transport, etc., of heavy\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nThe result of this system is that an officer and two non-commissioned\r\nofficers highly qualified to instruct in all artillery duties and\r\nexercises are sent annually to each brigade; also eight non-commissioned\r\nofficers well qualified to assist in the instruction of the\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men of their brigades in most duties\r\nconnected with heavy ordnance, and with enlarged views of artillery\r\nsubjects generally.\r\n\r\nFurther instruction is imparted to the regiment by sending batteries\r\nfrom Woolwich, Aldershot, and other contiguous stations, to carry on\r\ntheir practice, and regimental duty. They take guards and fatigues, move\r\nguns, and otherwise prepare for experiments, and each in its turn goes\r\nthrough a short course of instruction. The officers and a proportion of\r\nnon-commissioned officers of these batteries are formed into a class\r\nunder one of the gunnery instructors and his two assistants, and when\r\nthey have gone through a preliminary course, one of the batteries, or\r\nmore if practicable, are taken off duty for a month, in order to go\r\nthrough a systematic course, which, though short, is nevertheless highly\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nThe staff for government and instruction consists of:\r\n\r\n  Commandant and Superintendent of Experiments, Brigade major, Surgeon,\r\nAdjutant, Quartermaster, Master gunner, Sergeant-major,\r\nQuartermaster-sergeant.\r\n\r\n    _School of Gunnery._\r\n\r\n     1 chief instructor, a field officer\r\n     4 gunnery instructors (including   1 at Woolwich), captains.\r\n     1 first-class clerk.\r\n     1 third-class clerk.\r\n     6 first-class assistant instructors.\r\n     1 army schoolmaster.\r\n    22 store, magazine, and lobbymen.\r\n\r\n    _Experimental Establishment._\r\n\r\n     1 Assistant superintendent.\r\n     1 second-class assistant superintendent.\r\n     1 first-class clerk.\r\n     3 laboratory sergeants.\r\n     3 range sergeants.\r\n    15 storemen, etc.\r\n\r\n  1 staff wheeler, 1 hospital sergeant, 1 photographer, 1 armorer, 2\r\nwheelers, 2 smiths.\r\n\r\n  Elementary exercises for the purpose of instructing the squad in\r\ndealing with heavy weights without machines, showing the best mode of\r\napplying power in moving guns, commencing with light and progressing to\r\nguns of 23 tons; instruction concerning ropes, tackles, knots, etc.\r\n\r\n  Field, garrison, and siege gun drill with smooth bore and rifled guns\r\nmounted on various carriages and platforms; drills with howitzers and\r\nmortars; throwing up works of offence and defence, arming them and\r\nlaying platforms, making up ammunition, and arrangements for night\r\nfiring.\r\n\r\n  Exercises with military machines; construction of sheers, derricks,\r\netc., and placing them in awkward places; construction of trestle and\r\nother bridges for the purpose of passing heavy artillery across ditches,\r\netc., and of rafts for similar purposes.\r\n\r\n  Embarkation of artillery and horses.\r\n\r\n  Mounting, dismounting, and moving heavy guns without the aid of\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n  Practice from heavy and field guns, smooth bore and rifled, at known\r\nand unknown distances, with full and reduced charges.\r\n\r\n  Battalion drill and telegraphy.\r\n\r\n  In the lecture room, instruction in the mechanical powers, in gunnery,\r\nsystems of rifling, action and penetration of the service projectiles;\r\nconstruction, examination, and record of guns.\r\n\r\n  Army administration as affecting artillery.\r\n\r\n  Lectures on gunpowder, gun cotton, and fulminates; on metallurgy; on\r\nthe various modes of computing velocities and the instruments employed;\r\non electricity and steam; on strategy and tactics.\r\n\r\n  Cordage, knotting, tackles, parbuckling, pinching, slewing, etc.\r\n\r\n  Mounting and dismounting with and without gins.\r\n\r\n  Drill and practice with 32-pr. and 8 seconds guns.\r\n\r\n  Drill and practice with mortars on standing and travelling beds, also\r\nmounting and dismounting.\r\n\r\n  Drill practice with 40-pr. and 64-pr. guns, firing at moving target;\r\ndrill with 7 seconds B.L. guns; drill with 7 seconds, 9 seconds, and 12\r\nseconds M.L.R. guns and practice; dismounting and mounting the above.\r\n\r\n  Laying platforms, etc.\r\n\r\n  Use of platform wagon.\r\n\r\n  Light sheers.\r\n\r\n  Rocket drill and practice.\r\n\r\n  Facing B.L. guns.\r\n\r\n  Practical examination, etc.\r\n\r\n  Cordage, knotting, elementary exercises.\r\n\r\n  Ordinary shifts and machine drill.\r\n\r\n  Mortar drill and practice.\r\n\r\n  12-pr.

So high was its reputation, that the French\r\nStaff School was suggested and modeled after it. From motives of\r\neconomy, its independent government and instruction was gradually\r\nreduced, and its graduates, no matter how well qualified, were no longer\r\nsure of appointment and promotion, as against purchase, until, in 1855,\r\nit became virtually extinct,--the teaching force being reduced to two\r\nprofessors in mathematical studies, and the number of students to six.\r\nIn the same year, the French Staff School, with its thirteen military\r\nand five civil professors, and its range of instruction covering the\r\nentire field of practical duties which belong to an efficient staff\r\nofficer, was held up as a model. In the plans and discussions respecting\r\nthe reorganization and extension of the educational system of the army,\r\nwhich followed the Crimean war--in the Report (1855) of the Select\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons on Sandhurst; on the suggestions\r\n(1856) of the Commissioners on the Training of officers for the\r\nScientific Corps; the plan of Mr. Sidney Herbert, as Secretary of War,\r\nin 1854 and 1856; in the instructions of Lord Panmure, in 1856; in the\r\nresolution of the House of Commons, July 28, 1857; in the recommendation\r\nof the Royal Commission on the purchase system, in their Report of 1857;\r\nin the plans of the Council of Military Education, in the same year--the\r\nsupreme necessity of a staff college, with admission by competitive\r\nexamination, and the assured encouragement of appointment and promotion\r\non ascertained proficiency and general fitness, was so clearly\r\ndemonstrated, that at the close (December 17) of 1857, the Senior\r\nDepartment of Sandhurst was changed to that of a staff college, with a\r\ncorps of professors of its own. A separate building was completed for\r\nits accommodation, in 1862; admission was open to officers of all\r\nbranches of the service by competitive examination. All appointments to\r\nthe Staff were limited to graduates of the College, who had been\r\nattached, for specified periods, to each branch of the service, and to\r\nofficers of approved ability in the field.\r\n\r\nThe present establishment consists of\r\n\r\n  1 Commandant; 1 Adjutant; 2 Professors of Mathematics; 7 Professors\r\n(1 in each) of Military history, Fortification and Artillery, Military\r\nTopography, Military Administration, French, German, and Hindustani;\r\nbesides the services of the Riding-master, and the Professors of\r\nChemistry and Geology attached to the Cadet College of Sandhurst.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF ADMISSION IN 1868.\r\n\r\nThe college consists of thirty students. Fifteen vacancies will be\r\noffered for competition annually. Only one officer at a time can belong\r\nto the college from a battalion of infantry or a regiment of cavalry,\r\nand only four officers from the Corps of Royal Artillery; but any number\r\ncan compete. The officer desiring to compete must be serving with his\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nThe qualifications requisite for admission are:\r\n\r\n1. A service of not less than five years previous to examination,\r\nexclusive of leave of absence.\r\n\r\n2. A certificate from his commanding officer, as to his standing as a\r\nregimental officer, and his general knowledge of the service, character,\r\nhabits, and disposition in respect to employment on the staff.\r\n\r\n3. Certificate of having passed the examination for a troop or company.\r\n\r\n4.

The examination for\r\nbrigade major will be especially directed to the points more immediately\r\nconnected with the duties attached to the appointment, as Military Law,\r\nthe “Queen’s Regulations and Orders of the Army,” the Royal Warrant for\r\nPay, Promotion,” etc., and, in tactics, all that relates to alignments,\r\npoints of formation, distances, etc. The subjects of examination are the\r\nsame as in that for the appointment of aide-de-camp, but the examination\r\nwill be, throughout, of a higher order.\r\n\r\n  _c.--Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General, Deputy Assistant\r\nQuartermaster-General._\r\n\r\n  _Military Drawing and Sketching, Judgment of Ground, and its\r\nOccupation by all Arms._--The candidate will be required to make a rapid\r\nsketch on horseback, with report, of about six square miles of country;\r\nand to select a position which might be occupied by a given force of the\r\nthree arms, for some stated object, and to show how he would dispose the\r\ntroops for that purpose. He will afterward be required to make a correct\r\nand more finished plan of the position selected, with the disposition of\r\nthe troops shown upon it.\r\n\r\n  _Practical Geometry and Trigonometry._--The examination in these\r\nsubjects will be limited to determining heights and distances by ground\r\nproblems, and the ordinary trigonometrical calculations with the aid of\r\nlogarithms.\r\n\r\n  _Castrametation._--The candidate will be expected to know the mode of\r\nencampment for each arm of the Service.\r\n\r\n  _Permanent Fortification._--The theory and construction of permanent\r\nworks, as exemplified in Vauban’s or any other system the candidate may\r\nselect, as well as the modes of attack and defence applicable to them.\r\n\r\n  _Military History and Geography._--The candidate will be expected to\r\ngive proof that he has carefully studied at least four of the most\r\nmemorable modern campaigns, of which the details are best known, such as\r\nthose of Marlborough, Frederick the Great, Napoleon, and Wellington, and\r\nin these he must be able to explain the apparent objects of the various\r\nmovements and the reasons which he supposes led to their adoption, and,\r\nfurther, to describe the military geography of the seat of war.\r\n\r\n  _Foreign Languages and Professional Subjects._--In languages before\r\nthe Council of Military Education, as well as in professional subjects\r\nbefore the Board of Officers, the examination will be of a higher order\r\nthan those in (_a_) and (_b_).\r\n\r\n  The examination for Assistant Adjutant-General and Assistant\r\nQuartermaster-General will, throughout, be of a higher order.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSKETRY, AND OTHER ARMY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF MUSKETRY AT HYTHE.\r\n\r\nThe first School of Musketry was established in June, 1853, and was\r\ncomposed of detachments from regiments in the neighborhood, viz.: a\r\nsergeant, a corporal, and eight rank and file, from the first, second,\r\nand third battalion of the Grenadier Guards, Coldstream Guards, Scots\r\nFusileer Guards, Rifle Brigade, etc., to the number of eleven sergeants,\r\neleven corporals, and eighty-eight rank and file. In 1855, a permanent\r\ncorps of instructors of musketry was organized, and in 1861 a second\r\nschool was instituted at Fleetwood, which was discontinued in 1867, as\r\none establishment was found sufficient for training an adequate number\r\nof officers of the regular army, and a due proportion of officers and\r\nsergeants of militia and the Rifle Volunteer Corps.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the establishment at Hythe, district inspectors are\r\nappointed to superintend the general system of musketry instruction\r\nthroughout the army, viz., three in Great Britain, two in Ireland, five\r\nin the colonies, and ten in India.\r\n\r\nThe instruction embraces not only the practical use of fire-arms, but\r\nthe details of construction, both of the weapon and ammunition, the\r\ntheory of projectiles, and the comparative value of different arms for\r\ndifferent services.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the School of Musketry at Hythe consists of 1 Commandant\r\nand Inspector-General of Musketry Instruction; 1 Deputy Assistant\r\nAdjutant-General; 1 Chief Instructor; 2 Captain Instructors; 1\r\nPaymaster; 1 Quartermaster and Acting Adjutant; 1 Surgeon.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the preparatory and professional schools for officers of\r\nthe British Army, already described, there are other public institutions\r\nof a military character and for the military service, which will be\r\nbriefly noticed.\r\n\r\nARMY SURGEONS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the competitive examination of candidates for the post of\r\nAssistant Surgeon, for which a medical degree is preliminary, the\r\nsuccessful candidates must spend four months at Netley, where the Army\r\nMedical School is now located (since 1863), in connection with the Royal\r\nVictoria Hospital (capable of receiving one thousand patients), where\r\nlarge numbers of invalid patients of the army are treated. Here, with\r\nevery facility of study, observation, and practice, instruction is given\r\nby four professors, each with an experienced assistant, in military\r\nsurgery, medicine, pathology, and hygiene, and all the specialities of\r\nthe military hospital and field practice, peculiarities of climate, etc.\r\nAfter spending at least four months in the hospital, laboratory, museum,\r\nand lecture-rooms, the candidate is then examined for his commission as\r\nAssistant Surgeon.\r\n\r\nVETERINARY SURGEON.\r\n\r\nAlthough not exclusively for military service, all veterinary surgeons\r\nin the army must hold the diploma of the Royal Veterinary College in St.\r\nPancras, London, or of the Veterinary School in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nARMY SCHOOLS FOR SOLDIERS AND SOLDIERS’ CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nIn 1811, on the recommendation of the Duke of York, then\r\nCommander-in-Chief, a royal warrant was issued, authorizing the\r\nappointment of a sergeant-schoolmaster to each batallion for young\r\nrecruits and the children of soldiers, with provision for room, fuel,\r\nand light in each regimental barrack, and allowance for necessary books\r\nand stationery. In 1846, to give greater efficiency and uniformity to\r\nthe schools established under the warrant of 1811, a new warrant was\r\nissued, requiring that the sergeant-schoolmaster should obtain a\r\ncertificate of fitness from the military training college at Chelsea,\r\nand ordering the appointment of an inspector of army schools. In 1854,\r\nthe following classification of masters was introduced: _First Class_,\r\nat 7_s._ a day and certain allowances; _Second Class_, at 5_s._ 6_d._\r\nper day; _Third Class_, at 4_s._ per day; and _Assistants_ at 2_s._ The\r\nfirst-class schoolmaster was a warrant officer, and ranked next to those\r\nholding a commission; the second and third class ranked next to\r\nsergeant-major, and the assistants ranked as sergeants. At this time the\r\nprivileges of the regimental schools were extended to the children of\r\ndischarged soldiers, pensioners, and various persons employed about the\r\nbarracks. A schoolmistress was also employed for the infant division of\r\npupils, and for teaching needle-work to the girls. In 1863, the office\r\nof superintending schoolmaster, with a relative rank of ensign, was\r\ncreated, and four (since increased to twelve) from among the most\r\nexperienced first-class masters, were appointed to inspect and examine\r\nall army schools in their several military districts, and candidates for\r\npupil-teachers and schoolmistresses.\r\n\r\nAccording to the report of the Council of Military Education, for March,\r\n1870, there were two hundred and fifty-nine masters employed by the army\r\nschools, and four hundred and eighty-five mistresses and assistants in\r\nthe children’s schools. In Great Britain there were three hundred and\r\neighteen schools, and thirty-five thousand three hundred and seven\r\nnon-commissioned officers and men on the books, nine thousand three\r\nhundred and fifty-nine boys and girls, besides 11,414 children in the\r\ninfant schools.\r\n\r\nASYLUM FOR SOLDIERS’ ORPHANS.\r\n\r\nPrior to the establishment of the Army Schools in 1811, two large\r\ninstitutions for orphan children of soldiers who had fallen in battle or\r\nserving at foreign stations, had been founded and maintained at the\r\npublic expense.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Hibernian Institution at Dublin, Ireland, was commenced on a\r\nsum appropriated by the Irish Parliament in 1765, and chartered in 1769.\r\nIt has large buildings, with thirty-four acres of land, and provides for\r\nfour hundred and ten children on an annual parliamentary grant of twelve\r\nthousand pounds for its maintenance, besides the income from a small\r\nendowment.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Military Asylum in Chelsea was begun by the Duke of York in\r\n1801, and can now accommodate five hundred children on a public grant of\r\ntwelve thousand pounds, besides a further grant of three thousand pounds\r\nfor furniture and clothing from the Board of Works and the general vote\r\nof the army.\r\n\r\nNORMAL SCHOOL FOR TEACHERS IN ARMY SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nIn the Military Asylum at Chelsea, since 1846, there has existed a\r\nNormal School, where teachers of army schools may review their studies,\r\nor candidates for vacancies, or pupil teachers, may qualify themselves\r\nby study, observation, and practice, for appointment as schoolmasters,\r\nand when found qualified they receive certificates of the first, second,\r\nand third class, and are paid accordingly.\r\n\r\nMILITARY SCHOOL OF MUSIC AT KNELLER HALL.\r\n\r\nIn the British Army the cost of maintaining the regimental bands falls\r\nupon the officers. In the infantry a sergeant, a corporal and nineteen\r\nprivates are taken from the effective strength of each regiment to form\r\na band. These receive their ordinary regimental pay,--the rest of the\r\npay, and the entire salary of the band-master, if a civilian, together\r\nwith the cost of the music and musical instruments, are provided out of\r\nthe Band Fund, which is raised by “stoppages” from the officers on first\r\nappointment, and promotion, and by subscription. This fund is managed by\r\na committee of officers. Owing to difficulties in retaining the men, and\r\nof finding band-masters with all the requisite qualifications, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief (Duke of Cambridge) established a Military School of\r\nMusic in 1856, in concert with the Secretary of War, which was opened in\r\nKneller Hall for the reception of pupils in March, 1857. The institution\r\nmust be viewed (1) as a barrack, and (2) as a school of music. (1). As a\r\nbarrack it is under the direction of the Secretary of War, and is\r\nmanaged as any other barrack. (2). As a school it is under the immediate\r\ndirection of a military officer (who is appointed by the\r\nCommander-in-Chief), and a musical staff composed of nine permanent\r\nprofessors, four occasional professors, and a varying number of special\r\nassistants who are selected from the first-class students. There is also\r\na schoolmaster who gives instruction one hour a day in general knowledge\r\nto each class, and a military chaplain. The instruments taught in\r\nSoprano (8); Alto (3); Tenor (3); Bass (6). The students are divided\r\ninto four classes, each of which is divided into sections according to\r\nthe instruments to be learned. Seven hours a day are devoted to\r\nobligatory study--but more are given, and a restriction prohibits all\r\npractice after 6.45 in the evening.\r\n\r\nThis course of study occupies two years, and there is a higher which\r\ncomprises, beside practical instruction in playing and teaching the\r\ninstruments composing the band, some general acquirements under the\r\ntheory of harmony. There is also practical training in the duties of a\r\nconductor. In addition to ordinary military music, classical concert\r\npieces, or chamber music, specially arranged for wind instruments, are\r\nperformed. Cheap admissions to the operas and principal concerts of the\r\nmetropolis are obtained (900 in one year), to such of the advanced\r\nstudents as are recommended for diligence by the professors.\r\n\r\nPupils are selected from the various regiments, and often selected for\r\nthis special purpose. Boys specially trained for the bands are obtained\r\nfrom the Royal Military Asylum, Chelsea, the Hibernian Military School,\r\nDublin, and the Metropolitan Poor-law School. Each candidate must be\r\nexamined by the surgeon of the regiment, and certified to as in good\r\nhealth and with no tendencies to disease liable to be aggravated by\r\nplaying on a band instrument.\r\n\r\nA military band-master is now sanctioned by the Government for any\r\nregiment and battalion throughout the service, who receive regimental\r\npay of first-class staff sergeant, and 100_l._ from the Regimental Band\r\nFund.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of Kneller Hall as a barrack are borne by the government;\r\nas a school of music, by the regimental officers--including an original\r\nassessment of 5_l._ for supply of instruments, and the salaries to about\r\n1,100_l._ annually.\r\n\r\nThe average number of students annually admitted is 74; the average\r\nnumber in attendance, 148. The total number admitted since 1857 is 592,\r\nof whom 163 were practiced musicians, 63 band-masters, 271 band-men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. NAVAL AND NAVIGATION SCHOOLS IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY REMARKS.\r\n\r\nBefore describing a class of schools in England, which is now receiving\r\nspecial attention and aid from the Science and Art Department of the\r\nCommittee of Council on Education, viz. NAVIGATION SCHOOLS, we will\r\nglance at the condition of Nautical Education generally in this great\r\nmaritime and commercial country.\r\n\r\nThe old system of training officers for the Royal Navy, under which mere\r\nchildren with the smallest possible amount of elementary knowledge, made\r\nthe ship their school, even after a Naval Academy was established, had\r\nits peculiar advantages as well as its drawbacks. The captain, having\r\nthe nomination of an almost indefinite number of “youngsters,” stood\r\ntowards them in _loco parentis_. He was their governor, guardian, and\r\ninstructor, and did not “spare the rod” when he thought its application\r\nnecessary. The captain was then looked up to with a feeling bordering on\r\nawe. Without assigning a reason he could disrate or discharge a\r\nmidshipman; and he could also do much towards pushing him on in the\r\nservice. The youngster felt that he was entirely in the power of his\r\ncaptain, and, unless of a reckless cast, used his best endeavors to gain\r\nhis favor. The captain, on the other hand, talked of _his_ youngsters\r\nwith pride. He, (if he belonged to the better class of naval captains,)\r\ntook care that every facility should be afforded them for learning their\r\nduty, often made them his companions on shore, and superintended their\r\neducation afloat, sometimes taking a leading part in their teaching. He\r\nfelt responsible for their bringing up, for some were sons of personal\r\nfriends or relatives whom he had promised to watch over the youthful\r\naspirants, and all were more or less objects of interest to him. But all\r\nthis was swept away in 1844, and the captain’s patronage limited to one\r\nnomination on commissioning a ship, the Admiralty taking the rest of the\r\npatronage into their own keeping. And what was the result? No sooner had\r\nthe Admiralty absorbed the naval patronage--for the captain was\r\nfrequently shorn of his one nomination before leaving Whitehall with his\r\ncommission--than old officers and private gentlemen in middling\r\ncircumstances found themselves unsuccessful applicants, while the\r\ninfluential country gentleman totally unconnected with the service, but\r\nable perhaps to turn the scale of an election, was not under the painful\r\nnecessity of asking twice for a naval cadetship for his son, or the son\r\nof his friend. But what cared the captain for these Admiralty nominees?\r\nToo many of them were incapable of profiting by their opportunities, and\r\nothers neglected to avail themselves of the instructions of the\r\nprofessors of mathematics, and became the victims of dissipation.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. NAVAL OFFICERS.\r\n\r\n_Royal Naval Academy._\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to educate lads for the naval service of England was\r\nin 1729, when the Royal Naval Academy was instituted in Portsmouth\r\nDockyard. The course of instruction included the elements of a general\r\neducation, as well as mathematics, navigation, drawing, fortification,\r\ngunnery, and small arm exercises, together with the French language, the\r\nprinciples of ship-building and practical seamanship in all its\r\nbranches, for which latter a small vessel was set apart. The number was\r\nlimited to forty cadets, the sons of the nobility and gentry, and\r\nattendance was voluntary. Small as the corps was, it was never full,\r\nprobably because there was an easier way of gaining admission to the\r\nservice through official favoritism, by appointment direct to some ship,\r\non board of which during a six years’ midshipman’s berth, he acquired a\r\nsmall stock of navigation and a larger knowledge of seamanship and\r\ngunnery practice. In these ships where the captains were educated men,\r\nand took a special interest in the midshipmen, and competent instructors\r\nwere provided and sustained in their authority and rank, this system of\r\nship instruction and training worked well, as under the same conditions\r\nit did with us. In 1773 a new stimulus was given to the Academy by\r\nextending a gratuitous education to fifteen boys out of the forty, who\r\nwere sons of commissioned officers. In 1806, under the increased demand\r\nfor well educated officers, the whole number of cadets was increased to\r\nseventy, of whom forty were the sons of officers and were educated at\r\nthe expense of the government. From this date to 1837 the institution\r\nwas designated the Royal Naval College, but without any essential\r\nextension of its studies. In 1816 a Central School of Mathematics and\r\nNaval Architecture was added to the establishment, and in 1828 the free\r\nlist was discontinued, and the sons of military officers were allowed to\r\nshare the privileges of the school with the sons of naval officers, at a\r\nreduced rate in proportion to their rank. To keep up the number of\r\nstudents who would go through the four years course, it became necessary\r\nto extend special privileges, such as made promotion certain and rapid\r\nover those who entered the navy direct. This produced inconveniences and\r\njealousies, and in 1837 the Naval College was discontinued.\r\n\r\n_Training Ship and Naval College._\r\n\r\nIn 1857 the Admiralty adopted the plan of a Training Ship for naval\r\ncadets. The candidate was to be from thirteen to fifteen years of age,\r\nand to pass an examination in Latin or French, Geography, Arithmetic,\r\nincluding Proportion and Fractions, Algebra, to Simple Equations, the\r\nFirst Book of Euclid, and the Elements of Plane Trigonometry. At the end\r\nof twelve or six months, according to age, spent in study and practice\r\non the Training Ship, the cadet was examined in the studies before\r\nenumerated with the addition of Involution and Evolution, Simple\r\nEquations, the Elements of Geometry, and of Plane and Spherical\r\nTrigonometry, the simple rules of Navigation, the use of Nautical\r\nInstruments, Surveying, Constructing Charts, and the French language,\r\nbesides an elaborate course of Seamanship, and attendance on lectures on\r\nChemistry, Physics, Hydrostatics, &c. If this examination was\r\nsatisfactory, the cadet was appointed to a sea-going ship, and at the\r\nexpiration of fifteen months’ service he was eligible for the rating of\r\nmidshipman upon passing a further examination. The course in the\r\nTraining Ship (first the “Illustrious,” and subsequently changed to the\r\n“Britannia,” first in Portsmouth harbor and more recently at Dartmouth,)\r\nproved too extensive for mastery in one year; and in 1861 the conditions\r\nfor admission were lowered, the examinations in the school were made\r\nquarterly, and competitive, and if passed creditably at the end of a\r\nyear, according to a fixed standard, (3,000 being the number of marks\r\nattainable, and 2,100 giving a first class certificate,) the cadet is\r\nrated at once as midshipman, and credited a year’s sea-time. If he\r\nreceives a second class certificate (1,500 marks,) he must serve six\r\nmonths at sea, and pass another examination before he can be rated\r\nmidshipman. The cadet with a third-rate certificate (1,200 marks,) must\r\nserve twelve months at sea, and pass another examination for his\r\nmidshipman’s rating. Prizes and badges are also given, and the stimulus\r\nof competitive examination is applied as shown in the grading of\r\ncertificates.\r\n\r\n_Gunnery Instruction._\r\n\r\nIn 1832 a uniform and comprehensive system of gunnery instruction was\r\nprovided on the “Excellent,” under command of Captain (now Sir Thomas)\r\nHastings. To give such officers who were found deficient in the\r\nscientific knowledge requisite for a full understanding of the theory of\r\ngunnery, the Naval College was re-opened in 1839, under the general\r\nsuperintendence of the Captain of the Excellent, with Professors of\r\nMathematics, Navigation and Nautical Astronomy, Steam Machinery,\r\nChemistry and Marine Artillery. Accommodations were provided for\r\ntwenty-five half-pay officers, (captains, commanders, and lieutenants,)\r\nand a certain number of mates on full pay, for whom a special course of\r\nstudy was instituted. The time allowed at the College was a clear year’s\r\nstudy, exclusive of vacations, and those who have completed the course\r\nrank among the most distinguished officers of the profession.\r\n\r\n_Instruction in Steam and the Steam-Engine._\r\n\r\nWhen steam vessels came into use in the Navy, to qualify officers for\r\nspecial service in them they were encouraged to resort to Woolwich\r\nDockyard, and afterward to the Portsmouth yard, where an instructor was\r\nappointed and facilities for observation, study, and experiments were\r\nprovided. Many officers repaired to private factories, and worked at the\r\nlathe, in stoke-hole and the engine-room, and thus acquired a practical\r\nknowledge of this department of their profession. When the Naval College\r\nwas established on its present footing, a small steamer, the “Bee,” was\r\nbuilt and attached under the charge of the instructor in\r\nsteam-machinery. And now the greater part of the captains and commanders\r\non the active list have obtained certificates of having passed the\r\ncourse in Steam and the Steam-engine.\r\n\r\n  _Admiralty Order respecting Naval Cadets and Midshipmen, dated April\r\n1, 1860._\r\n\r\n  CADETS.\r\n\r\n  “I. No person will be nominated to a Cadetship in the Royal Navy who\r\nshall be under 12, or above 14 years of age, at the time of his first\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n  “II. Every candidate, on obtaining a nomination, will be required to\r\npass an examination at the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth, within\r\nthree months of nomination.[3] In the special cases of nomination\r\ngranted to the sons of natives of the colonies a candidate will be\r\nallowed to pass a preliminary examination on board the flag or senior\r\nOfficer’s ship on the Station. But such an examination must be passed in\r\nstrict accordance with these regulations, and should the candidate be\r\nfound qualified, it will still be necessary that he should be sent to\r\nEngland, to be entered on board a training ship, where he will be\r\nsubject to the same regulations as other Cadets.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: These examinations will take place on the first\r\n    Wednesdays in the months of March, June, September, and December.]\r\n\r\n  “III. The candidate must produce a certificate of birth, or a\r\ndeclaration thereof made before a magistrate.\r\n\r\n  “IV.

To write English correctly from\r\ndictation, and in a legible hand. 2. To read, translate, and parse an\r\neasy passage from Latin, or from some foreign living language--the aid\r\nof a dictionary will be allowed for these translations.\r\n\r\n  “And to have a satisfactory knowledge of--3. The leading facts of\r\nScripture and English history. 4. Modern geography, in so far as relates\r\nto a knowledge of the principal countries, capitals, mountains and\r\nrivers. To be able to point out the position of a place on a map, when\r\nits latitude and longitude are given. 5. Arithmetic, including\r\nproportion, and a fair knowledge of vulgar and decimal fractions.\r\n6. A knowledge of the definitions and axioms of the First Book of\r\nEuclid.\r\n\r\n  “As drawing will prove a most useful qualification for Naval Officers,\r\nit is recommended that candidates for the Service should be instructed\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\n  “V. Candidates will be allowed a second trial at the next quarterly\r\nexamination. Should he not pass this second examination he will be\r\nfinally rejected.\r\n\r\n  “VI. If the candidate succeeds in passing the required examination he\r\nwill be at once appointed to a training ship, for the purpose of\r\ninstruction in the subjects contained in Sheet No. 1,[4] as well as in\r\nthe rigging of ships, seamanship, the use of nautical instruments, &c.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: The examination on leaving the training ship will\r\n    embrace all the subjects of the former examination, except Latin,\r\n    and in addition to them it will include, in algebra, simple\r\n    equations; the elements of geometry, plane trigonometry, and the\r\n    solution, &c., as in the Circular No 288, dated Feb. 23rd, 1857;\r\n    and in addition the use of the globes with correct definitions of\r\n    latitude, longitude, azimuth, amplitude, and other circles of the\r\n    sphere, and drawing.]\r\n\r\n  “VII. Quarterly examinations will be held on board the training ship,\r\nwhen any candidate may be examined in the subjects contained in Sheet\r\nNo. 1, and also, in the course of instruction, in the rigging of ships,\r\nseamanship, &c.\r\n\r\n  “VIII. If a candidate be found at the quarterly examinations, not to\r\nhave made sufficient progress, or if, by indifferent conduct or idle\r\nhabits on board the training ship, he shall show his unfitness for the\r\nService; it will be the duty of the Captain to make a special report\r\nthereof to the Admiralty, in order that the Cadet may be at once removed\r\nfrom the Navy.\r\n\r\n  “IX. When the candidate shall have completed twelve months’\r\ninstruction, exclusive of vacations, in the harbor training ship, he\r\nwill be examined, and should he obtain a certificate of proficiency, he\r\nwill be discharged into the sea-going training ship. A first-class\r\ncertificate will entitle him to count twelve months’ sea time; a\r\nsecond-class, will entitle him to count six months’ sea time; a\r\nthird-class, will entitle him to count six months’ sea time. But should\r\nhe not obtain a certificate, he will be discharged as unfit for the\r\nService.\r\n\r\n  “X. On leaving the harbor training ship, it is intended that the Cadet\r\nshall pass three months in a sea-going training ship, for practical\r\ninstruction in seamanship and navigation, which period will count for\r\nsea time, and at the end of this period, if his conduct has been\r\nsatisfactory, he will be appointed to a ship with the rating of a\r\nMidshipman.\r\n\r\n  MIDSHIPMEN.\r\n\r\n  “To qualify a Midshipman for a Lieutenant’s Commission he must have\r\nattained the full age of 19 years, and have completed 5½ years’ actual\r\nservice in Her Majesty’s Navy, including the time awarded to him on\r\nleaving the training ship.\r\n\r\n  “XI. All Midshipmen, until they have passed their examinations for\r\nLieutenants, are to keep a book in which the ship’s reckoning is to be\r\nworked out and noted; at sea, this book is to be sent in every day to\r\nthe Captain, instead of the slip of paper containing a day’s work. It is\r\nalso to be produced at their examinations; and during the last six\r\nmonths of their service as Midshipmen, it must contain the working of\r\nthe observations.\r\n\r\n  “XII. A Midshipman when he shall have served two years and a half in\r\nthat rank will be required to pass the following examination:--1. In\r\npractical navigation, showing that he understands the principle of\r\nnavigating a ship from one distant port to another, by dead reckoning\r\nand by his own observations; and that he can explain the principles of\r\nthe same; and that he can also take and work a double altitude and\r\nazimuth. 2. A sufficient knowledge of a chart to enable him to place\r\nthereon the position of the ship by observation as well as by cross\r\nbearings; and to lay off the true and compass courses. 3. Such knowledge\r\nof nautical surveying as may enable him to measure a base line and\r\ndetermine positions by angles, and the manner of ascertaining heights\r\nand distances. 4. If he has served in a steam vessel, an acquaintance\r\nwith the different parts and working of the steam engine.\r\n5. A proficiency in French to be attained if he has had an opportunity.\r\n6. He must be a good practical observer, and his sextant must be\r\nproduced in good order. 7. He must produce log-books kept by himself\r\nfrom the time of his entering into a sea-going ship, and certificates of\r\ngood conduct.\r\n\r\n  “8. He will likewise be examined as to his progress in the knowledge\r\nof rigging masts, bowsprits, &c. He must also know the great gun and\r\nsmall arm exercise, the use of tangent sights, the charges for the guns\r\nof the ship, and be able to exercise the men at his quarters. A report\r\nof the progress he has made in each of the above subjects is to be made\r\nto the Secretary of the Admiralty in the half-yearly return.\r\n\r\n  “This examination is to be conducted by the Officer in command, not\r\nbelow the rank of Commander, and the next senior Officer in the ship,\r\nand the examinations in navigation in the presence of a Captain or\r\nCommander, by two Naval Instructors, when it may be practicable, or by a\r\nNaval Instructor and a Master, or, where there is no Naval Instructor,\r\nby two Masters; that in gunnery, by a gunner, or other competent\r\nOfficer; and the candidate is to be made to take and work out his own\r\nobservations for latitude, longitude, variation, &c., as the case may\r\nbe. First or second class certificates are to be given according to the\r\nmerit of the candidate, in the form A, page 8, or he is to be rejected\r\nif found incompetent.\r\n\r\n  “XIII. A Midshipman, having completed his term of service, and being\r\n19 years of age, may be provisionally examined by the Captain or\r\nCommander of such ship or vessel with the aid of other competent\r\nOfficers, Lieutenant, Master, or second Master, when no other ships are\r\npresent; and if they find him to be duly qualified they are to give him\r\na certificate to that effect, dated on the day of such examination, and\r\nthe Captain may forthwith give him an acting order as Mate; but he must\r\nbe re-examined, on the first opportunity that shall afterwards offer, by\r\nthree Captains or Commanders, and if he passes successfully he will\r\nreceive from the Commander-in-Chief, or senior Officer, an acting order\r\nas Mate, to take rank according to the first certificate.\r\n\r\n  “The examining Officers are to be most strict in their investigation\r\nof the qualifications of Officers, and they are to see that everything\r\nrequired by these Regulations has been complied with by the candidates,\r\nand that he produces certificates of good conduct from Captains he has\r\nserved under from the time of his discharge from the training ship.\r\n\r\n  “XIV. All Acting Mates and Midshipmen will be required to undergo the\r\nfollowing final examinations,--1. In Seamanship--On board the training\r\nship at Portsmouth. 2. In Gunnery--On board the _Excellent_. 3. In\r\nNavigation and the Steam Engine--At the Royal Naval College.\r\n\r\n  “Acting Mates, who have already passed abroad, are to present\r\nthemselves for examination, on board the training ship at Portsmouth, at\r\nthe first examination day after their arrival in England, or after being\r\npaid off, and having passed in gunnery they are then at liberty to\r\nselect either the first, second, or third examination day at the Royal\r\nNaval College.\r\n\r\n  “XV. Any Officer rejected on his first examination at the College will\r\nincur the forfeiture of three months’ seniority in his rank as Mate. He\r\nmay present himself on the next examination day, but a second rejection\r\nwill incur the forfeiture of three months’ more seniority; he may again\r\npresent himself on the next examination day, but a third rejection will\r\ncause his name to be removed from the list of the Navy.\r\n\r\n  “XVI. Officers, when they have passed their final examination at the\r\nRoyal Naval College, as provided for in these Regulations, will be\r\nconfirmed from the date of their first certificate. The non-appearance\r\nof an Officer for examination at the Royal Naval College at the times\r\nrequired by these Regulations will be considered as an acknowledgment of\r\nhis not being qualified, and he will be dealt with in the same manner as\r\nif he had been actually rejected, on each day on which he may have\r\nomitted to appear, unless under certified ill-health, to be duly\r\nreported at the time.\r\n\r\n  “XVII. Naval Instructors are to keep a school journal, or register,\r\nwhich is to be produced when required by the Captain of the ship or the\r\nexamining Officers, and the Captain is to allow them reasonable access\r\nto the charts and chronometers, for the purpose of instructing the\r\nOfficers in their use.\r\n\r\n  “XVIII. The Captains of Her Majesty’s ships are to take care that a\r\nconvenient place is set apart and proper hours are fixed for instruction\r\nby the Naval Instructor; and all Acting Mates and Acting Second Masters,\r\nas well as all executive Officers under that rank, are to attend; and\r\ncare is also to be taken that they are regularly instructed in practical\r\nseamanship, rigging, and the steam-engine, and a monthly examination day\r\nis to be established.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Education for Officers has been recently under discussion\r\nin Parliament, and some modifications of the existing system is now\r\nunder the consideration of the Admiralty, looking to greater maturity of\r\nage and preparation for admission, a more extended and thorough course\r\nof scientific training in cadets, and continued opportunities of study\r\nwith accompanying examinations for officers up to the grade of\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE ROYAL MARINE ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\nIn 1804 an artillery company was attached to each of the three divisions\r\nof the Royal Marine Corps, to supply the service of the bomb-vessels,\r\nand in time of peace, to drill the whole of the marines in gunnery. But\r\nthey were soon made available for other purposes, and on the outbreak of\r\nthe American war in 1812, a large body of the Marine Artillery, with a\r\nfield battery and rocket equipment, accompanied the battalions of\r\nmarines then formed for service in America. In 1817 this force was\r\naugmented to eight companies, and Sir Howard Douglass, while advocating\r\nthe establishment of “Naval Depots of Instruction,” for the purpose of\r\nconverting officers and men of the Royal Navy into efficient gunners,\r\ncomplimented the Marine Artillery as being “either a corps of good\r\ninfantry, of scientific bombardiers, or expert field artillery men, well\r\nconstituted, thoroughly instructed, and ably commanded.” It was not\r\nuntil June, 1830, that an Admiralty order directed that a school of\r\ngunnery should be established at Portsmouth, on board the “Excellent,”\r\nand with the intention of making this school the one means of\r\ninstruction in this department, it was farther ordered, in December,\r\n1831, that the Marine Artillery, as a distinct and separate corps,\r\nshould be broken up, retaining two companies as a nucleus of a larger\r\nforce, should such become necessary. And the necessity appeared; for the\r\nexperience of a few years proved that it would be impossible for the\r\nschool to effect, to any important extent, the results which were\r\ndesired. In 1841, therefore, a third company of the artillery was\r\nordered; in 1845, two more; and by subsequent additions, its strength\r\nwas raised in 1859, to sixteen companies, with a total of 3,000 officers\r\nand men, who were formed into a separate division with its head quarters\r\nat Fort Cumberland.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Marine Artillery were at first appointed from the\r\nmarine corps, without any particular qualifications being required, but\r\nafterwards their appointments were made probationary and conditional\r\nupon the satisfactory completion of a prescribed mathematical course. In\r\n1839 it was decided that a certain number of second lieutenants should\r\nbe allowed to prepare themselves for examination on board the Excellent,\r\nand upon the re-opening of the Royal Naval College as an educational\r\nestablishment for mates, it was arranged that the students for the\r\nartillery should be transferred to it, and that their success or\r\nfailure, after a years’ further study, should decide upon their\r\nappointment to the artillery. Another and final modification took place\r\nupon the introduction of preliminary examinations for the marines, and\r\nthe subsequent formation of a cadet establishment on board the\r\nExcellent. In case of vacancies in the artillery, those who had passed\r\nthe best examinations upon first entering the corps, were selected for\r\nthe College, and no officers were allowed to become candidates on any\r\nother terms, their final success depending as before, upon the progress\r\nthey might make as students at the College.\r\n\r\nThe cadets have their periods of study limited to two years; it may be\r\nless, but can not be more. They have to acquire a competent knowledge in\r\nArithmetic, Algebra, Euclid, including the first four books and part of\r\nthe sixth, Plane Trigonometry, the use of the Sextant, Fortification,\r\nEnglish History, and French. To this may be added a practical course of\r\nNaval Gunnery. Their studies are carried on under the direction of a\r\nmathematical instructor, and an instructor of fortification. A French\r\nmaster attends twice a week. If on obtaining his commission, the young\r\nmarine officer is selected to qualify for the artillery at College, he\r\nmust be prepared at the end of a year to pass an examination in\r\nAnalytical Trigonometry, Differential and Integral Calculus, Conic\r\nSections, Statics and Dynamics, Hydrostatics, and “Steam,” besides being\r\nrequired to have an increased knowledge of Arithmetic, Algebra, and\r\nFortification. In a year little more than a superficial knowledge of\r\nthese studies can possibly be attained, yet insufficient as this period\r\nclearly is, it has sometimes been the case that, when a large number of\r\nsubalterns were required for the artillery, young officers have been\r\nappointed who have completed only half their term at College. Having\r\nthus gained his appointment to the artillery, his remaining in it\r\ndepends upon there being a vacancy or not at the time when his seniority\r\non the general list of the corps advances him to each successive grade\r\nof rank.\r\n\r\nThe men are volunteers from the light infantry divisions, possessing\r\ncertain specified qualifications as to age, height, intelligence and\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe course of training, which is with a few exceptions, common to both\r\nofficers and men, is very comprehensive; it includes--\r\n\r\n1. The usual infantry drills and musketry instruction.\r\n\r\n2. The exercise of field guns and rockets, with such field battery\r\nmovements as are of real practical importance.\r\n\r\n3. The service of heavy ordnance, including guns, howitzers, and sea and\r\nland service mortars.\r\n\r\n4. The naval great gun exercise.\r\n\r\n5. Mounting and dismounting ordnance, with or without machines.\r\n\r\n6. The various methods of slinging and transporting ordnance.\r\n\r\n7. Knotting, splicing, and fitting gun gear, use of pulleys, &c.\r\n\r\n8. A laboratory course, including:--use and preparation of tubes,\r\nrockets, and fuzes; making up cartridges; manufacture of port fires,\r\nValenciennes stars, signal rockets, blue lights, &c., with instruction\r\nin the manufacture and effects of gunpowder and other explosive\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\n9. A course of practical gunnery, comprising--instruction in the nature\r\nand uses of the various kinds of guns, howitzers, and mortars; in the\r\nnatures, employment, and effects of the various projectiles; disparting\r\nand sighting ordnance; heating and firing red-hot shot; and such matters\r\nconnected with the theory of projectiles as may have a practical\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n10. Practice from different natures of ordnance, with every description\r\nof projectile.\r\n\r\nThe system of instruction is so arranged that every officer and\r\nnoncommissioned officer is qualified, as far as practicable, as an\r\ninstructor, a registry being kept of each man’s progress and\r\ncapabilities. A spirit of emulation has been created, attended with the\r\nhappiest results, and the whole course is now gone through in less than\r\ntwelve months, without the men being wearied or overworked.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. SCHOOLS FOR WARRANT OFFICERS, SEAMEN, AND BOYS.\r\n\r\n1. _Seamen’s Schoolmasters._\r\n\r\nSchoolmasters for seamen are allowed on all ships having a complement of\r\nnot less than three hundred men, and an allowance of £5 per annum is\r\ngranted, in addition to the pay of any rating he may hold, to a\r\nqualified person doing this duty of the captain’s orders, in ships not\r\nhaving a seamen’s schoolmaster. An allowance is made for books, slates,\r\n&c. to all ships having schools. The success of the school to the boys\r\nand the men depends mainly on the interest shown in it by the captain\r\nand second officer in command, and especially on the character of the\r\nschoolmaster employed. The situation is too often filled by an old\r\nquartermaster, or sergeant of marines, who obtains the berth as a kind\r\nof retirement, or by some person who has a fancy for sea life, but who\r\nis fit for nothing on shore, much less for teaching under the\r\ndifficulties of a ship at sea. It is found that when the schoolmaster is\r\nqualified for this special service, and is entered for continuous\r\nservice, and being placed in regard to pay, pension, and good conduct\r\nbadges on an equality with other chief petty officers, and when a log or\r\nregister of attendance is kept, and frequent reports are made to\r\nsuperior authority, the result is highly conducive to discipline, and to\r\nthe elevation of the seamen’s habits and character. One of the\r\nCommissioners recently appointed to examine into the state of popular\r\neducation among every class of British subjects, speaking of the effect\r\nof this class of schools upon the men on board the ships, says: “After\r\nvisiting the “Cambridge,” at Plymouth, as I walked with the captain\r\nthrough the lower deck, I found many, both boys and men, reading books\r\nwith the greatest attention. In the evening of the same day, on the\r\nlower deck of the “Agincourt,” I found the same scene, while others were\r\nengaged in draughts, chess, or writing letters to their friends.” With\r\nthe present scale of punishment on board of men of war, the school is an\r\nindispensable element of discipline. The Commissioners referred to, in\r\ntheir report to the Queen, recommend that schoolmasters of higher\r\nqualification be appointed, with an increase of pay, and promotion by\r\nmerit, when their schools are reported favorably upon by any authorized\r\ninspectors, and with the same retiring pension as master-at-arms, and\r\nthat in addition to an elementary general education, a knowledge of\r\nnavigation, physical geography, and natural history be required of\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\n2. _Schools on board of Ships in Harbor._\r\n\r\nA second class of naval schools consists of Harbor Ships, into which\r\nboys entered for admission to the Navy, are received until they are\r\ndrafted into the various sea-going ships. Four of these ships, the\r\n“Victory” and “Excellent,” at Portsmouth, the “Impregnable” and\r\n“Cambridge,” at Plymouth, are specially devoted to instruction. Boys\r\nremain in these ships for one year. The first part of this period is\r\ngenerally spent on board the ship, the latter part in the practising\r\nbrig, in which during the summer months they are out at sea for five\r\ndays during the week. There is a school under a seamen’s schoolmaster on\r\nboard of each of these ships. The Commissioners report that the school\r\ntime is necessarily subject to great interruptions, but that much\r\nvaluable instruction might be given with better organization and\r\nmethods. They recommend that an educational test for admission to these\r\ntraining ships be introduced, which would at once have a good effect\r\nupon the general education of the people resident in the seaport towns,\r\nand elevate the intelligence, morality and manners of the seamen.\r\n\r\n3. _Royal Marine Schools._\r\n\r\nThere are four schools attached to the divisions of marines quartered in\r\nbarracks respectively at Woolwich, Chatham, Portsmouth and Plymouth, and\r\nanother to the division of marine artillery quartered at Portsmouth.\r\nThese five schools are attended by the marines and their children. The\r\nattendance of the men is for the most part voluntary, with the exception\r\nof the non-commissioned officers, who are obliged to attend the school\r\nuntil they have passed a prescribed examination. In the marine artillery\r\nevery man is required to read and write, and if deficient in these\r\nrespects, he is obliged to attend the school until his requirements are\r\nreported to be satisfactory. The Commissioners recommend that a better\r\nclass of schoolmasters be specially trained and employed, and that they\r\nreceive better rank and pay, and more efficient assistance in the\r\ndischarge of their duties, and that trained mistresses be employed as\r\nassistants in the boys’ schools, and have the exclusive charge of the\r\ngirls’ schools, in all of which sewing should be taught and practised\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\n4. _Dock-yard Schools._\r\n\r\nThere are seven dock-yard schools, held in the respective dock-yards of\r\nDeptford, Woolwich, Chatham, Sheerness, Portsmouth, Devenport, and\r\nPembroke. They were founded in 1840, and are designed for the\r\ninstruction of the apprentices employed in these establishments. The\r\nmasters of them were originally foremen of the yard, men of good\r\nattainments, who had for the most part received their education in the\r\nSchool of Naval Architecture; but in 1847 a special class of\r\nschoolmasters was established, ranking as foremen of the yard. The\r\nobject of these schools is to advance the education of the young men,\r\nsince none are admitted as apprentices to become shipwrights until they\r\nhave passed an examination.\r\n\r\nExaminations for admission as apprentices to the dock-yards are held\r\nhalf-yearly, and about one-half are given to the lads who pass the best\r\nexaminations, and the other half to nominees of the superintendent.\r\nThese latter, however, are required to come up to a prescribed\r\nintellectual standard. The examinations are held under the Civil Service\r\nCommissioners, in the following subjects:--1. Dictation exercises to\r\ntest Hand-writing and Orthography. 2. Reading. 3. Arithmetic.\r\n4. Grammar. 5. English Composition. 6. Geography. 7. Mathematics,\r\n(Euclid, first three books, Algebra including Quadratic Equations,\r\nArithmetical and Geometrical Progression.) The master shipwright and the\r\nschoolmaster are of opinion that the boys entered by competition are the\r\nbest, and among the working shipwrights themselves the opinion is\r\nunanimous that the system of entering at least one-half by competition\r\nought not to be done away. The effect in inducing parents to keep their\r\nchildren at school in order to fit their sons for examination is very\r\nmanifest, and the justice of promotion by personal merit is felt and\r\nacknowledged by all.\r\n\r\nFor the first three years all the apprentices are compelled to attend,\r\nwhile those in the fourth year may volunteer to attend with others if\r\nthey show an aptitude for study, and a disposition to profit by the\r\nopportunities afforded them. The fifth-year apprentices may attend after\r\nthe hours of labor. So long as admission to the Central School of\r\nMathematics and Naval Construction at Portsmouth, and an immediate\r\nappointment and regular advancement to the higher offices in the yard,\r\nafter leaving the latter establishment, stimulated young men to the\r\nacquisition of knowledge, the attendance for the fourth year was\r\nnumerous and regular. But the abolition of the School of Mathematics,\r\nand with it the consequent promotion of its graduates, operated very\r\nunfavorably both on attendance and habits of private study.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 the Admiralty adopted a supplementary course of study for such\r\napprentices as have been diligent in their work, exemplary in conduct,\r\nand made satisfactory progress in acquiring a knowledge of their trade.\r\nThis course, extending over two years for three hours a day, embraces\r\nDescriptive Geometry, Elementary Mechanics, and Hydrostatics,\r\nLogarithms, Calculations of displacement, Stability of ships, &c., Plane\r\nTrigonometry, Differential Calculus, with Analytical Geometry, Advanced\r\nMechanics, Hydrostatics, and Dynamics. This class of apprentices perform\r\nthe duty ordinarily devolved on mould loft apprentices, under the\r\nsuperintendence of the draughtsmen in the mould loft. Scholarships of\r\ntwenty pounds per annum are granted to such members of the class as show\r\nsuperior ability, attainments, and good conduct.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1859 there were 1,060 pupils in the five Dock-yard Schools,\r\nviz.: 461 apprentices, and 599 factory boys, the latter attending mainly\r\nin the evening.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners pronounce these schools valuable institutions, both to\r\nthe state and to the individuals, and they have demonstrated, according\r\nto the testimony of one of the master shipwrights, that the educated boy\r\nmakes the superior workman, and the most moral and temperate man. They\r\nrecommend that a better class of teachers be employed, and that their\r\npay should be increased by half the amount of the scholarship accorded\r\nto the most proficient pupils of the advanced class, and that the\r\nintellectual part of the examinations for promotion should be conducted\r\nby the Civil Service Commissioners. To make this class of schools what\r\nthey should be, much must be done to improve the education of the\r\nlaboring classes, outside of the dock-yards.\r\n\r\n5. _Greenwich Hospital Schools._\r\n\r\nThe Greenwich Hospital School for 200 pupils, the orphans and sons of\r\ndisabled seamen, and known as the Upper School, was founded in 1715. In\r\n1805 the Royal Naval Asylum (founded in 1798,) consisting of 600 boys\r\nand 200 girls, was removed to Greenwich, and in 1821, was united to the\r\nformer, and was designated the Lower School, making in that year (1821)\r\na total of 1,000 children. In 1828, the number of boys in the Lower\r\nSchool was reduced to 400, and the Upper to 600, one-third of the latter\r\nbeing the sons of commissioned and ward-room officers. In 1841, the\r\ngirls’ school was abolished, leaving 400 in the Upper, and 400 in the\r\nLower School.\r\n\r\nThe schools are supported partly by the income of a special endowment\r\n(£136,000,) and partly by the general funds of the Hospital. The total\r\nexpenditure for the two schools in 1859 was £20,234, for an average\r\nattendance of 774 boys.\r\n\r\nBoys are admitted to the Lower School solely upon the claims of their\r\nfathers’ services. Until quite recently admissions to the Upper School\r\nwere by patronage, but by recent regulations all exclusive privileges of\r\nnomination have been discontinued, and all claims for admission into the\r\nschool (the distinction of Upper and Lower School having been done\r\naway,) are decided by a Committee of Selection, according to a scale\r\nlaid down. The 110 boys found to be best in the last examination of\r\n1860, were constituted the Nautical School, admission to which is now\r\ngained by competitive examination among the other boys of the school.\r\nThe instruction of this school (for a Nautical School had always\r\nexisted, composed of the two first classes of the Upper School,) is\r\nconfined to Mathematics and Navigation, and qualifies its recipients to\r\nrise in their profession as masters’ assistants in the Royal Navy, and\r\nas midshipmen and apprentices in the merchant service. A system of pupil\r\nteachers, selected on account of aptitude for teaching, and a\r\nwillingness to adopt the profession of schoolmaster as their career in\r\nlife, has been recently introduced.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners referred to, recommend that a Normal School for the\r\nNavy be established at Greenwich, similar to that for the Army at\r\nChelsea, that the present pupil-teachers who are above the age of\r\neighteen form the nucleus of this school, and that others to the number\r\nof ten at first, be admitted after examination; that the course of their\r\neducation be adapted to their future calling, and that at the close of\r\ntheir career they be examined, and receive a certificate of\r\nqualification. These teachers thus educated and trained, would be fitted\r\nto take charge of the Navigation Schools, under the Board of Trade;\r\nwould enter the Dock-yard Schools, as assistants at first, and they\r\nwould be appointed to masterships on board the Training Ships, both in\r\nthe royal and commercial ports.\r\n\r\nThey also recommend that boys from the second class in the Ship Schools\r\nbe selected to serve as pupil-teachers under the schoolmasters, and that\r\na small allowance be made them, in addition to their pay, if they pass a\r\nsatisfactory examination at the end of the year, and their conduct is\r\nreported to be satisfactory, and at the end of three years they be\r\nadmitted, if found competent, to the Normal School at Greenwich, or that\r\nthey be entered for continuous service as assistant schoolmasters, with\r\nrank and pay and pension of first class petty officers. At the end of\r\ntwo years this last class of assistants, if found competent, will be\r\nadmitted to the practising school at Greenwich, for six months at the\r\nleast, during which residence they will devote their time to the art of\r\nteaching, and to the study of Navigation, Physical Geography, and\r\nNatural History. On the completion of their training they will go out as\r\nRoyal Navy Schoolmasters, and will be divided into three classes, viz.:\r\n3d class, who shall have the rank and pay of chief petty officers,\r\n(continuous service,) and shall be entitled to the same pension. 2d\r\nclass, who shall rank above master-at-arms, and shall receive the same\r\npay and pension. 1st class, shall rank with third class warrant\r\nofficers, with same pay and pension, and after long and approved\r\nservice, masters of this class shall be eligible for further promotion\r\nto rank and pay of second and first class warrant officers.\r\nSchoolmasters in each of these classes shall be entitled to £10 per\r\nannum in addition to their pay, if they are recommended by the captain\r\nand chaplain, and their schools are certified to be in an efficient\r\nstate when examined.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVIGATION SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 the English Government constituted the Department of Science and\r\nArt, to extend a system of encouragement to local institutions of\r\nPractical Science, similar to that commenced a few years before in the\r\nDepartment of Practical Art, the two Departments being united in the\r\ncourse of the same year, and the united Department being administered at\r\nfirst by the Board of Trade, and in 1856, by the Education Department.\r\nTo this Department of Science and Art, was assigned in 1853 the general\r\nmanagement of a class of schools which had been instituted or aided by\r\nthe Mercantile Marine Department of the Board of Trade, for the benefit\r\nof the navigation interests of the country. Instruction in navigation\r\nwas given in the seaports by private teachers, without system, and to a\r\nvery small number of those who should be well grounded in the principles\r\nof the art before being entrusted with the responsibilities of command,\r\ninvolving the lives and property of others. To introduce system, to give\r\npermanent employment to a larger number of well-qualified teachers of\r\nnavigation, to elevate and improve the attainments and character of\r\nBritish masters, mates and seamen, and indirectly but largely increase\r\nthe supply for the Royal Navy in time of war, the Government had\r\ndetermined to encourage local effort in establishing Nautical Schools.\r\nWith this view the Marine Department of the Board of Trade had\r\nestablished two schools prior to 1853, one in London, and the other in\r\nLiverpool; and an arrangement had been made with the Admiralty, by which\r\nit was believed five or six pupil-teachers, who had completed their term\r\nof instruction at the Royal Naval School at Greenwich, would be able to\r\nattend the scientific courses in the Metropolitan Schools of Science and\r\nArt, and be instructed in those sciences which would better fit them to\r\nbecome masters of schools of navigation in the seaport towns. In 1854,\r\nthe Trinity House[5] of Hull reorganized its old school of navigation,\r\nafter the plan of the Royal Naval School at Greenwich, with two\r\ndivisions, the lower for a class of boys who need elementary\r\ninstruction, and the upper, for boys in the technical studies of a\r\nseafaring life. With the latter was opened an evening school for adult\r\nseamen. Similar schools, with a junior or lower division to revise and\r\ncomplete the general and preparatory studies, and a senior or upper\r\nschool for special scientific and practical instruction in navigation\r\nand seamanship, were established at Yarmouth, Leith, Glasgow, Aberdeen,\r\nBelfast, Dublin, Waterford, and other ports, fifteen in all up to 1862,\r\ngiving instruction to over 3,000 persons, and all of them enlisting\r\nlocal co-operation and individual payment with governmental aid. As an\r\nexample of this class of schools we cite a brief description of one of\r\nthe earliest established, from a Report of the Inspector, Edward Hughes,\r\none of the masters of the Greenwich Hospital Schools.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: The Trinity Board of Hull was established in 1537, in\r\n    imitation of Trinity House, London, incorporated by Henry VIII in\r\n    1515, (but existing long before,) for the promotion of commerce\r\n    and navigation, licensing pilots, erecting beacons and\r\n    lighthouses, &c. Both were probably in imitation of Charles V who\r\n    established at Seville, in Spain, at the _Casa de Contratacion_,\r\n    lectures on navigation, and an examination of persons to act as\r\n    pilots and mariners.]\r\n\r\n  _London Navigation School._\r\n\r\n  _The London Navigation School_ is held on the upper floor of the\r\nSailors’ Home Institution, situated in Well Street, London Dock, and\r\nconsists of two separate apartments, occupied by the Upper and Lower\r\nsections.\r\n\r\n  The upper section is for the instruction of masters and mates of the\r\nmerchant service in the following subjects, viz.:\r\n\r\n  Sextant Observing. Chart Drawing. Geometry. Algebra. Trigonometry. The\r\nSailings. Use of the Nautical Almanac and Mathematical Tables. Principle\r\nand Construction of Chronometers. Methods of determining the Latitude\r\nand Longitude. Nautical Surveying. Compasses and Magnetism of Ships.\r\nTheory of Winds, Tides, and Currents. Methods of taking and recording\r\nMeteorological Observations. Principle and Construction of the Steam\r\nEngine as applied to the Paddle Wheel and Screw Propeller.\r\n\r\n  The Lower section is for the education of seamen and apprentices. The\r\ncourse embraces the following subjects:--\r\n\r\n  Reading. Writing. Dictation and Letter Writing. Arithmetic. Geography.\r\nThe Sailings. Sextant Observing. Method of Keeping Ships’ Books.\r\n\r\n  The hours of attendance are from 9 to 12 a.m., 2 to 4 p.m., and 6 to 9\r\np.m. on the first five days of the working week, and from 9 to 12 a.m.\r\non Saturdays.\r\n\r\n  The fees are six shillings per week for masters and mates, sixpence\r\nfor seamen, and apprentices are admitted free.\r\n\r\n  The instruction of both sections is conducted by teachers who have\r\nbeen educated and trained in the Greenwich Hospital Schools, and who\r\nhold certificates of competency for teaching Navigation and Nautical\r\nAstronomy, from Mr. Riddle, the Head Master of the Nautical School.\r\n\r\n  As regards the students who at present attend the school, it is\r\nmanifest that the masters and mates taught in the senior section come\r\nfor the express purpose of learning to solve certain problems in\r\nNavigation and Nautical Astronomy, required for passing the examination\r\nof the Local Marine Board, and they are unwilling to devote any portion\r\nof their time to the other subjects that enter into the course of\r\ninstruction. These, though essential to the education of every master\r\nmariner, are unfortunately not at present required of a candidate to\r\npass an examination which proclaims him competent to take command of a\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\n  The lower section is composed of seamen and apprentices, who are for\r\nthe most part employed during the day at their ships in the docks, and\r\nhave acquired the rudiments of an English education before entering the\r\nschool. They attend during their short stay in port from 6 to 9 in the\r\nevenings, and their chief object seems to be to acquire a knowledge of\r\nthe sailings and the methods of keeping the books of a ship.\r\n\r\n  Both sections are taught the use of nautical instruments, and for this\r\nimportant purpose the Board of Trade has granted a liberal supply of\r\nrequisites to carry out an efficient system of instruction, as will be\r\nseen by the list appended to this Report.\r\n\r\n  Those students who are sufficiently educated are accustomed to work\r\nout their own observations. None of them have been allowed to leave the\r\nschool without receiving as great an amount as was possible of general\r\ninformation, in addition to the special instruction in the subjects for\r\nwhich they attended. Lectures have been delivered in the evenings upon\r\nthe Steam Engine, Electricity, and Magnetism, with other branches of\r\nNatural Philosophy; and the Physical Geography of the Ocean has received\r\nparticular attention.\r\n\r\nThe following statistics are given in the Report of Capt. Ryder, of the\r\nRoyal Navy, in 1858.\r\n\r\n  The officers of the committee of management are:--\r\n\r\n  Chairman, Admiral Sir H. Hope.\r\n  Secretary, Captain George Pierce, R.N.\r\n  Head-Master, John Bowing, 1 certificate.\r\n\r\n  The total number receiving instruction in navigation in or through the\r\nagency of the school during 1858 has been 149, showing a total increase\r\nof 25 since last year. The total fees have been 46_l._ 15_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n  The entire number of adults and boys who have at any time paid fees\r\nduring the year are, masters, 3; chief mates, 17; only mates, 2; second\r\nmates, 37; seamen, 62; apprentices, 28; total number of students, 149.\r\n\r\n  The following is the rate of fees paid by adults and boys per\r\nweek:--In the day classes--Masters studying for extra certificates,\r\n6_s._; chief mates studying for master, 6_s._; only mates studying for\r\nchief mates, 6_s._; second mates studying for chief mates, 6_s._; seamen\r\nstudying for only mates, 6_s._; for second mates, 6_s._; apprentices\r\nstudying navigation, 6_s._; those not studying navigation, 1_s._; seamen\r\nnot studying navigation, 1_s._; boys learning navigation, 6_d._; boys\r\nnot learning navigation, 6_d._ In the evening classes--Adults learning\r\nnavigation, 3_s._; not learning navigation, 1_s._; boys learning\r\nnavigation, 3_s._; not learning navigation, 6_d._\r\n\r\n  The average attendance at the classes has been:--\r\n\r\n  Day classes,     morning, 7; afternoon, 6.\r\n  Evening classes,                        6.\r\n\r\n  Grand total of fees, 46_l._ 15_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n  The amount of aid afforded to the school by the Department has been\r\n43_l._ 16_s._ 4_d._, which sum includes the payments for the master’s\r\ncertificate and other allowances, the payments to pupil-teacher, the\r\ncost of medals, &c.\r\n\r\n_School Ships._\r\n\r\nThere is another class of nautical schools for destitute and endangered\r\nboys, which are aided by the government through the Ragged School\r\nSociety, and are kept on board of ships, the practical seamanship of\r\nwhich might advantageously be incorporated into the navigation schools.\r\nThe expense of these ships per day is thus given by Capt. Ryder, in his\r\nReport on Navigation Schools in 1858.\r\n\r\n  I have collected some statistics showing the expense of school ships.\r\nThe Akbar, a frigate at Liverpool, is a reformatory, and has about a 100\r\nboys. The Venus, also a frigate, is in charge of the Marine Society, and\r\nanchored near Woolwich; she is a school ship for destitute lads, and has\r\nabout 140 boys. In the Akbar, supported, partly by local contributions\r\nand partly by the Government grant of one shilling a day for each boy,\r\nthe expense of the establishment is probably reduced to as low a scale\r\nas possible. The Marine Society is a corporation which can afford to be\r\nmore liberal in its arrangements. The Akbar was fitted out at an expense\r\nof 1,800_l._ but about 1,000_l._ is considered to be sufficient for a\r\nfit out, if the hull is in good repair. The Marine Society’s ships are\r\nalways fitted out by the Admiralty without charge. The Akbar costs about\r\n250_l._ a year for repairs, &c.\r\n\r\n  Estimate of Annual Expense per Boy, deduced from Report.\r\n\r\n                        Akbar.

Ryder, of the Royal Navy, was appointed to\r\ninspect the Navigation Schools connected with the Department of Science\r\nand Art, and report on their condition and future management. The\r\nstatements and suggestions of this report harmonize so fully with the\r\nconclusions which we have reached respecting the need and mode of\r\nestablishing and managing this class of schools in our own country, that\r\nwe can not better express our own views than by making liberal extracts.\r\n\r\n  The Government is very anxious to raise the tone of the Commercial\r\nMarine for the following reasons:--\r\n\r\n  (_a._) Because the Commercial Marine supplies even in time of peace a\r\nconsiderable number of men to the Royal Navy, and because in time of war\r\nwe should have to rely upon it almost entirely to enable us to man our\r\nships when our reserves were exhausted, which would soon be the case in\r\na naval war.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) Because on the efficiency of our commercial marine depends to a\r\ngreat extent our position as a commercial country, and on our position\r\nas the greatest commercial country rests our supremacy among European\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n  (_c._) Because to the commercial marine is entrusted every year an\r\nimmense amount of valuable property. Want of skill, intelligence, and\r\nreadiness of resource largely increases the yearly loss of this\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n  (_d._) Because to the commercial marine every year are entrusted the\r\nlives of a large and increasing number of Her Majesty’s subjects. Want\r\nof skill, intelligence, and readiness of resource largely increase the\r\nyearly loss of life at sea.\r\n\r\n  (_e._) Because the commercial marine consists of more than 200,000\r\npersons, and is, therefore, an important portion of the nation,\r\nconsidering it numerically.\r\n\r\n  (_f._) Because the commercial marine represents England, its religion,\r\nlaws, customs, and habits, in every foreign country, and it is desirable\r\nthat our representatives should cease to exhibit (as is now frequently\r\nthe case,) the worst side of the national character. Large numbers of\r\nthe sailors in our commercial marine are at present neither good men nor\r\ngood sailors, but are disorderly, addicted to drink, inefficient at sea\r\nand all but useless in harbor. Many of them who reach the rank of mate\r\nand master compare disadvantageously in general knowledge with the mates\r\nand masters of foreign vessels. There are of course numerous brilliant\r\nexceptions. They are to be found chiefly in the service of the large\r\nship-owners. In knowledge of seamanship English masters and mates need\r\nnot fear a comparison with those of any other nation.\r\n\r\n  The Government, anxious to raise the tone of the Commercial Marine,\r\nhas endeavored to purify the stream at its source, by the creation or\r\nsupport of Navigation Schools, in order that as soon as possible, by the\r\nintroduction of well educated lads, its character may be elevated and\r\nimproved. The Navigation Schools referred to are supported by fees, by\r\nlocal subscriptions, and by aid from the Department of Science and Art.\r\nTheir object is to offer instruction in the scientific branches of an\r\nEducation specially adapted to the Nautical Profession.\r\n\r\n  In commencing an investigation into the present position and prospects\r\nof the Navigation schools, it is evidently advisable to ascertain the\r\nnumber of vacancies that occur annually in the commercial marine; these\r\nvacancies are occasioned by death, desertion, and change of profession.\r\nIt is much to be desired that these vacancies should all be filled by\r\nwell educated English, Scotch, and Irish lads, for in time of war we\r\ncould only recruit from the Commercial Marine those sailors who are\r\nBritish subjects.[6]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: According to the Registrar General’s Report for 1858,\r\n    there were 13,200 Foreigners serving in the Mercantile Marine in\r\n    1854, natives of the following countries:--Americans, (U.S.,)\r\n    3,888; Austrians, 532; Belgians, 198, Danes, 423; Germans, 319;\r\n    Greeks, 76; Hollanders, 1,(3); Italians, 110; Norwegians, 570;\r\n    Portuguese, 564; Russians, 44; Prussians, 563; Spaniards, 388;\r\n    Swedes, 1,512; French, 479; Various, viz., South Americans,\r\n    Chinese. &c., &c.. 2,499; total, 13,200.]\r\n\r\nCapt. Ryder estimates the number of lads required to supply the annual\r\nvacancies by death in the British Commercial Marine at over 5,000, and\r\nby desertion and change of profession, by at least 1,000 more, or a\r\ntotal of over 6,000; and that schools for seamen and officers should be\r\nsufficient to give an annual supply of at least that number, and so\r\naccommodate 18,000 students. According to the Report of the Registrar\r\nGeneral of Seamen, there were bound and registered at the several ports\r\nof the United Kingdom, in the year 1856, 7,410 apprentices. The 176,387\r\nmen (not including masters,) employed in the Home and Foreign Trade,\r\nwere classified as follows: 21,204 mates, 13,232 petty officers, 83,682\r\nseamen, 23,974 apprentices and boys, 12,640 other persons, 1,612\r\nengineers, 4,896 firemen. Of this number 14,375 were foreigners, and\r\n7,712 lascars. During the year 1856, examinations were passed for extra\r\nmasters, 22; for ordinary masters, 1,223; for first mates, 689; for only\r\nmates, 12,223; for second mates, 940--a total of 4,097. Capt. Ryder\r\ncalculates that the total number required every year to fill up the\r\nvacancies and meet the demands of an expanding commerce as follows:\r\n\r\n  Of those who leave the service,                           6,690\r\n  Of those who are drowned,                                 1,300\r\n  Of those who die of disease,                              2,660\r\n  The average annual increase by expansion of commerce,     3,365\r\n\r\n  Total supply required,                                   14,015\r\n\r\nCapt. Ryder remarks that the system of nautical education should be\r\nbroad enough and attractive enough to bring in all the boys of all\r\nclasses who wish to go to sea, or may be required to meet the demands of\r\nthe national and commercial marine. The education given should make\r\nathletic, intelligent, handy seamen, and impart such an amount of\r\nscientific knowledge of navigation and seamanship as will qualify a due\r\nproportion for a lower grade of officers.\r\n\r\n  The first point to be aimed at would apparently be the establishment\r\nof an adequate number of schools, so as to offer scientific instruction\r\non the lowest terms to a sufficient number of boys, to supply the demand\r\nfor educated young men to fill the vacancies in the ranks of masters and\r\nmates. Their knowledge of seamanship must of course be gained before the\r\nmast.\r\n\r\n  A commercial navy, fed by a supply of lads that had for three years\r\nattended the classes at a Navigation school would challenge comparison\r\nfor general knowledge and information with any profession in England,\r\nand would soon cease to be the last resort of those idle, troublesome\r\nfellows, expelled from the agricultural class and the various trades,\r\nwho are too old, too ignorant, or too profligate ever to make even\r\nindifferent sailors.\r\n\r\n  Having stated what appears to me to be the ground that may be\r\nbeneficially covered by a network of navigation schools, I will proceed\r\nto state what, in my opinion, are the means by which a Navigation School\r\nmay be rendered most attractive and efficient.\r\n\r\n  I. _A Navigation School assisted by the Government should offer sound\r\nInstruction especially adapted to the Nautical Profession._\r\n\r\n  Although at first sight the number of subjects named hereafter may\r\nappear large, and the education of too high an order, these objections\r\nwill vanish when it is remembered that lads are not acceptable on board\r\nmerchant ships until they are 15-16, because they are of little use, and\r\ngive trouble; and yet, as has been already stated, if not attracted to\r\nthe Navigation schools at the age of 12-13, and induced to remain in\r\nattendance on the classes until they are 15-16, they will be drawn into\r\nsome other profession.\r\n\r\n  The course of instruction which is adopted must necessarily therefore\r\nbe sufficiently comprehensive to extend over _three_ years, and at the\r\nsame time continue to the last to be specialty adapted to conduce\r\ntowards the boy’s success in his profession.\r\n\r\n  The subjects which appear to be suitable for boys destined for the\r\nnautical profession and retained under instruction from 12-13 to 15-16\r\nare as follows:--\r\n\r\n    *  (1.) Reading and writing from dictation.\r\n    *  (2.) First four rules of arithmetic.\r\n    *  (3.) Grammar.\r\n      (4.) A complete course of arithmetic.\r\n      (5.) Algebra to quadratics, with application.\r\n      (6.) Geometry, Books of Euclid, I. II. III., and\r\n           a few propositions in Book IV.\r\n      (7.) Trigonometry, plane and spherical.\r\n      (8.) Navigation.\r\n      (9.) Nautical astronomy, including lunar double alt.\r\n           and Sumner’s method.\r\n     (10.) Practical use of the instruments used at sea.\r\n     (11.) Geography, descriptive, }\r\n     (12.) Geography, physical,    }\r\n             { especially as regards products, climates, &c.}\r\n     (13.) Chart drawing; surveying.\r\n     (14.) Free-hand drawing.\r\n   * (15.) History, particularly Scripture History and English History.\r\n   * (16.) Letter writing; book-keeping.\r\n     (17.) Mechanics and steam-engine.\r\n     (18.) Magnetism and electricity in relation to ships.\r\n     (19.) Laws of storms and tides.\r\n     (20.) Knowledge of the code of signals.\r\n     (21.) Mercantile laws and usages, as far as is necessary for\r\n           the master of a merchant ship.\r\n     (22.) Gymnastics.\r\n\r\n[* The boys are expected to be proficient in these subjects before\r\nentry, and they need only be taken up in the way of review.]\r\n\r\nThe above subjects are taught in the Navigation School at Hull.\r\n\r\nII. _A Navigation School should provide a good supply of apparatus,\r\nviz., instruments, books, maps, slates, &c. without any charge to the\r\npupils._\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, where a class of Navigation Schools has been established as\r\npart of the system of National Education, a very liberal supply of\r\nsextants, books, maps, &c., is given to each school by the Board of\r\nEducation.\r\n\r\nIII. _A Navigation School aided by Government should offer valuable\r\nprizes in the shape of exhibitions, instruments, books, &c._\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty we have to contend with is the reluctance on the\r\npart of some parents, the inability on the part of others, to maintain\r\ntheir children during the three years’ course.\r\n\r\n  Exhibitions and prize-schemes should therefore be established on the\r\nmost liberal footing.\r\n\r\n  Prizes had been awarded by the Department in only two or three\r\ninstances before my tour of visits.\r\n\r\n  (_a._) I beg to suggest that _prizes_ be awarded, when deserved, at\r\nall the schools every half year.\r\n\r\n  The prizes to consist of sextants, watches, instruments, books, &c.\r\nThe future prizes to be placed at the commencement of the half-year\r\nunder the charge of the local committee, to be exposed in the schoolroom\r\nin a case with a glass lid or cover. (The half-yearly value of the\r\nprizes to be about 15_l._); the prizes to be fairly and openly competed\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n  A very limited number of sextants should be given away, not more than\r\none each half-year among all the schools. The prizes not to be awarded\r\nexcept on the most satisfactory proof of the lad’s sufficient\r\nproficiency.\r\n\r\n  (_b._) I beg to suggest that _exhibitions_ be established on the\r\nfollowing scale, viz., at the rate of twelve for a school giving\r\ninstruction to 100 boys, or one to every eight boys, and be awarded at\r\nall the schools every half-year.\r\n\r\n  The boys after the examination to be divided in the following\r\nmanner:--\r\n\r\n  The First Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the\r\nClasses for a period under 6 months.\r\n\r\n  The Second Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the\r\nClasses for 6, and under 12 months.\r\n\r\n  The Third Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the\r\nClasses for 12, and under 18 months.\r\n\r\n  The Fourth Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the\r\nClasses for 18, and under 24 months.\r\n\r\n  The Fifth Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the\r\nClasses for 24, and under 30 months.\r\n\r\n  The Sixth Division to consist of all the boys who had attended the\r\nClasses for 30, and under 36 months.\r\n\r\n  Exhibitions at the rate of one in eight boys to be given to the most\r\nsuccessful boys in each group.\r\n\r\n  The exhibitions for the 1st and 2nd Divisions to consist of remission\r\nof fee and a donation of 6_d._ a week for ensuing half-year.\r\n\r\n  The exhibitions for the 3rd and 4th Divisions to consist of remission\r\nof fee, and a donation of 1_s._ a week for ensuing half-year.\r\n\r\n  The exhibitions for the 5th and 6th Divisions to consist of remission\r\nof fee, and a donation of 2_s._ a week for ensuing half-year.\r\n\r\n  This part of my proposal is elastic, the value of the exhibitions can\r\nbe increased if the principle is approved of, and the number may be\r\nextended even to offering an exhibition to every boy attaining a certain\r\ndegree of proficiency in the studies of the school.\r\n\r\n  The chief merits of this plan are (1.) that as all the exhibitions are\r\nthrown open for competition every half-year, the spirit of emulation is\r\nconstantly kept alive; it is notorious that the attainment of an\r\nexhibition or scholarship which will be held throughout a student’s\r\ncareer is often the prelude to idleness. (2.) That exhibitions are\r\nplaced within the reach of the youngest boys.\r\n\r\n  The examination to decide on the exhibitions and prizes should take\r\nplace at the end of the half-year. The questions to be sent from the\r\nDepartment, and the answers to be sealed up in the presence of the boys,\r\nand sent to the Department on the evening of the examination day. The\r\nprizes and exhibitions should be awarded at the commencement of the next\r\nhalf-year. As the examination should not, if possible, extend over more\r\nthan one day, the Department might make a selection from among the\r\nsubjects taught. As the inspector can not be present, one or more of the\r\nlocal committee should remain in the school during each examination.\r\n\r\n  The result of each examination should be allowed to be published in\r\nthe local papers; competition will then be created among the various\r\nschools at the seaport, who will view with great interest the position\r\nof their boys on the examination list.\r\n\r\nCapt. Ryder suggests (1.) that each boy who holds an exhibition or gains\r\nprizes, have the fact engrossed on a _vellum certificate_, and receive a\r\n_medal_ or _badge_. (2.) That all graduates of the school who bring a\r\ngood character from their captain or shipowner, for one year after\r\nleaving the school, receive one pound from the funds of the school. (3.)\r\nThat shipowners and the Admiralty be induced to look first to the\r\nNavigation schools for their apprentices, and that they open to\r\ncompetition among the prize boys of the schools, any choice places in\r\ntheir gift. (4.) That officers and masters of ships, and public men\r\ninterested in nautical matters be invited to visit the schools.\r\n\r\n  IV. _A Navigation School should provide an ample Educational Staff,\r\nwhose income should be sufficient, and a certain portion of it fixed,\r\nand whose energies should be mainly directed to the Education of the\r\nBoys._\r\n\r\n  The educational staff, as a general rule, is very insufficient, owing\r\nto a school for adults having been generally established in connexion\r\nwith the school for boys.[7] This course was adopted chiefly for\r\neconomical reasons, it being intended that the large fees from the adult\r\nclass should pay the greater proportion of the expense of the school;\r\nbut it has resulted in the boys’ school being most seriously injured, as\r\nfollows, without any compensating advantages.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: The school at Hull is the only navigation school at\r\n    which _no_ adults are received.]\r\n\r\n  The boys who pay fees, from 6_d._ to 1_s._ a week, are constantly and\r\nunavoidably neglected by the head master, whose interest it is to attend\r\nto the adults who pay from 5_s._ to 7_s._ a week; and even if superior\r\nto that motive, the head master can not leave the adults for more than a\r\nfew minutes at a time, because, and not unnaturally, they insist on his\r\nremaining with them.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity in the mode of paying masters of Navigation Schools is in\r\nincreasing his compensation from all other sources by the payment by the\r\nDepartment of an amount represented by the certificate he may hold of\r\nhis success in passing examination in certain group of subjects. The\r\nscheme is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Group I. Mathematics necessary to the study of navigation,    £5\r\n  Group II. General navigation and nautical astronomy,          15\r\n  Group III. Adjustment and skillful handling of instruments,    5\r\n  Group IV. Physical geography,                                 10\r\n  Group V. Physics, mechanics, marine steam engine,             10\r\n  Group VI. Chemistry,                                           5\r\n  Group VII. Natural history,                                    5\r\n  Group VIII. Chart, freehand, and mechanical drawing,           5\r\n                                                              -----\r\n                                                               £50\r\n\r\nThis group payment is a well devised scheme to induce masters to improve\r\nthemselves, and is applicable to teachers of every grade, and if rightly\r\napplied, will operate as a constant stimulus to professional\r\nimprovement. But in the case of this class of schools, where there are\r\npupils on a varying scale of direct payment to the teacher, the teacher\r\nwill be tempted to give his particular attention to the pupils who pay\r\nbest. This can be counteracted by making the masters’ payment depend on\r\nthe proficiency of the scholars.\r\n\r\n  To obtain and keep the services of the zealous, intelligent, and very\r\nsuperior men who alone are fit to take charge of navigation schools,\r\nI believe a superannuation allowance would be at the same time the\r\ngreatest and most economical inducement.\r\n\r\n  I beg to suggest that at 60 years of age a navigation master be\r\nallowed to\r\n  retire with his group money as an allowance. This would be a great\r\ninducement to remain in connection with the Department, and to pass in\r\nas many groups as possible.\r\n\r\n  The direct inducement which I propose to give to the educational staff\r\nto bring their schools up to the highest state of efficiency is a\r\npayment in money, and I have been induced to propose this from the sense\r\nof the paramount advantage derived in any undertaking from making it the\r\ndirect pecuniary interest of agents to act up to their instructions.\r\n\r\n  I propose that every head master, every assistant master and every\r\npupil-teacher employed in teaching the boys shall receive a sum of money\r\nin addition to his fixed salary and his group money to depend on and\r\nvary with the success of the school at the half-yearly examinations. The\r\nmode by which I propose to estimate the amount of this payment will be\r\ndetailed further on, when I speak of inspections.\r\n\r\n  It consists of a sliding scale of payment, so contrived that it is the\r\ndirect pecuniary interest of the head master to bring all his boys up to\r\nthe highest state of proficiency, and also the direct pecuniary interest\r\nof all the educational staff to refrain from forcing on the clever boys,\r\nif by so doing they neglect the duller boys, and also to refrain from\r\ndrawing the boys into the upper and more showy subjects to the neglect\r\nof the lower, more elementary, but more important subjects, errors\r\ncommonly and but too justly ascribed to schoolmasters in their endeavors\r\nto give to their schools the appearance of high efficiency.\r\n\r\n  I am aware that the sliding scale of payment which I propose has the\r\ndemerit of novelty.\r\n\r\n  The Committee of Council, fully alive to the advantage of a sliding\r\nscale, have provided that, in the primary schools, the master’s pay\r\nshall depend on and vary with the school pence and the capitation grant\r\n(a grant which is made to depend upon the attendance of the children,)\r\nin the art schools it is made to depend on and vary with the number of\r\nprizes won by the students.\r\n\r\n  The disadvantage of the former plan is that the sliding scale, being\r\nmade to depend upon mere numerical attendance, both particular\r\nproficiency and general proficiency are ignored.\r\n\r\n  The disadvantage of the latter is that it is made the master’s direct\r\npecuniary interest to force on the clever boys to the neglect of the\r\ndull boys, while general proficiency and numerical attendance are\r\nignored.\r\n\r\n  There are doubtless good reasons why these very different plans should\r\nhave been adopted in primary and art schools.\r\n\r\n  In the scheme of varying payment which I propose for navigation\r\nschools, both the general proficiency of the school and the numerical\r\nattendance of the scholars are made the measures of the masters’\r\nemoluments, while the proficiency of individual boys is fostered by\r\nprizes and exhibitions.\r\n\r\n  V. _The Masters of Navigation Schools should display great\r\nintelligence and aptitude for teaching, should be intimately acquainted\r\nwith the best methods of instruction, and be zealous in the performance\r\nof their duties._\r\n\r\n  As a general rule I have found the masters intelligent and apt to\r\nteach. The majority of them have enjoyed the privilege of an education\r\nat Greenwich under Mr. Riddle.\r\n\r\n  It is important that the masters should be drawn from some normal\r\nschool; Greenwich school appears admirably adapted for such purpose. To\r\ndraw a large supply of masters from that school, and retain their\r\nservices, the position of the masters in a pecuniary point of view must\r\nin my opinion be improved. But if this is done an engagement should be\r\nentered into to remain as a navigation schoolmaster for a certain time,\r\nand after that, not to leave without at least two months’ warning.\r\n\r\nThe position of assistants should be open to all persons whose\r\ncredentials previously received, as to good character, proficiency in\r\nall the subjects taught in this class of schools, and required for the\r\nplace, are satisfactory. The examination should be public, and the\r\nresults published. The vacancies among the head masters should be open\r\nto competition among the assistant masters.\r\n\r\n  VII. _The Navigation Schools should be judiciously situated, have\r\nlarge airy rooms, a good playground, gymnastic poles, and a lending\r\nlibrary._\r\n\r\n  Exercise at gymnastics is most beneficial to the boys’ health, and\r\nconfirms them in their choice of the naval profession. The lads when\r\nthey go to sea are much more useful aloft if they have acquired the\r\nagility and daring which can alone be gained by gymnastic exercises.\r\n\r\n  One of the causes of the rapid deterioration in the physique of our\r\nsailors is the diminution of work aloft consequent on the introduction\r\nof steam.\r\n\r\n  VIII. _The Fees in a Navigation School should be carefully adjusted._\r\n\r\n  A carefully adjusted scheme of fees from 1_d._ to 1_s._ per week will\r\nnot exclude by their amount any poor boys whom we might wish to admit,\r\nor to repel by their insignificance those parents who would attach no\r\nvalue to that which cost them little.\r\n\r\n  The larger portion of the fees, after deducting a certain fixed sum,\r\nor a certain definite proportion of them for local expenses, will stand\r\nin the school accounts to the credit of the local committee, and will be\r\nexpended from time to time, with the consent of the Department, in\r\npaying the masters’ salaries, the boys’ exhibition money, &c.\r\n\r\n  In some seaports, where there is a pertinacious disinclination on the\r\npart of the parents of the boys to their going to sea, I have suggested\r\nto the committee the undertaking to return all or a portion of the\r\nschool fees of any boy who has passed above a certain mark, on proof\r\nbeing received that the boy has sailed. This would in many cases act\r\nboth on parent and child as a great inducement to the boy to go to sea.\r\n\r\n  IX. _Navigation Schools should be periodically inspected and reported\r\non._\r\n\r\n  Inspection to be really valuable should be thorough. Now the subjects\r\nin which it is proposed that the boys shall be taught at the Navigation\r\nSchool are very numerous, and none of them should, if possible, be\r\nallowed to escape the notice of the inspector and the test of\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n  I propose that there shall be two examinations every half-year, (1)\r\nthe general examination, to measure the progress and proficiency of the\r\nnavigation classes, and the payment to be made to the educational staff;\r\n(2) the special competitive examination for prizes and exhibitions. The\r\nfirst will be held in the course of the half-year, in the presence of\r\nthe inspector and master, the answers, however, to be looked over and\r\nvalued in London. The second will be held at the close of the half-year,\r\nin the presence of the master and of one or more of the local committee.\r\nIt will be entirely a written examination, the questions to be sent from\r\nthe Department. To prevent any suspicion of unfair treatment, the\r\nexamination books should, after each examination, be sealed up at the\r\nclose of the day, in the presence of the boys, and sent to London. The\r\nprizes and prize studentships will be awarded when the school meets\r\nagain, at the commencement of the next half-year. The answers will be\r\nvalued in London, by a person appointed for that special purpose. The\r\npractice I have adopted is to give full numbers for an accurate answer,\r\nhalf numbers for an answer which, though inaccurate, shows intelligence.\r\n\r\n  The inspector who conducts the general examination should have with\r\nhim various papers of questions of equal value on each subject, so as to\r\ndiminish the possibility of information as to the questions set at the\r\nexamination being communicated from one school to the other. The masters\r\nhave a direct pecuniary interest in preventing any information being\r\nsent to the other schools.\r\n\r\n  I suggest that the general examination, to ascertain the amount of\r\nexamination money, be conducted in the following manner:\r\n\r\n  The school to be arranged previous to the arrival of the inspector, in\r\nfive classes, each class separated from the other as far as the\r\narrangements of the school will admit, and the five classes to be so\r\ncomposed as to be about equal, both in average and collective\r\nintelligence. No difficulty is experienced by the masters in doing this.\r\n\r\n  The number won by the boys in a class in a particular subject will be\r\nadded together and divided by the number of boys in the class; the\r\nresult will be the mean number for that subject for that class, and the\r\nclasses being equal, that number will be a measure of the proficiency of\r\nthe school in that subject. The number of boys in the school multiplied\r\nby the sum of the mean numbers will be the number which will determine\r\nthe sum of money to be apportioned to that school, and divided among the\r\neducational staff.\r\n\r\n  I propose that a sum of money, at the discretion of the Department, be\r\ndivided[8] once a year among the schools, in the ratio of the numbers\r\nobtained as above, and that notice be given to them to that effect at\r\nthe commencement of each year, naming the total sum. I propose that the\r\nsum won by the school should be divided among the educational staff in\r\nthe following proportions:--\r\n\r\n    Head Master 5 shares, but total not to exceed                £30\r\n    Assistant Masters, each 2 shares, but total not to exceed     12\r\n    Pupil-Teachers, each 1 share, but total not to exceed          6\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: I prefer this to any other plan, because the stimulus\r\n    to exertion will be greater.]\r\n\r\n  As every progressive step made by the dullest boy who attends the\r\nclasses tells on the gross number, and through it on the pecuniary gain\r\nof the whole staff, the staff will have no temptation to neglect, but on\r\nthe contrary, every inducement to push on the dull boys, and as\r\nproficiency in the lower subjects counts as much as proficiency in the\r\nhighest the common fault of neglecting the low subjects would evidently\r\ndiminish very much the profits of the staff, and will therefore be\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\n  I consider this sliding scale would be preferable to paying the master\r\na certain sum for every prize won in the school, which is a direct\r\ntemptation and inducement to him to select from time to time the most\r\npromising boys, and put them under pressure to make prize boys of them,\r\nneglecting the dull boys of the same standing who can not on that system\r\nof reward be productive of any benefit. The collateral advantages of\r\nthis system.\r\n\r\n  (1.) It becomes the direct personal interest of the staff to retain\r\nthe boys as long as possible, in order that at each examination, there\r\nshall be as many boys as possible well advanced in all the subjects.\r\n\r\n  (2.) That it becomes their direct personal interest, to select from\r\namong the boys presenting them selves for entry, those that are most\r\nadvanced in the elementary subjects, so that their backwardness may\r\ndiminish the mean numbers as little as possible.\r\n\r\n  (3.) That it becomes their direct personal interest to work the school\r\nwith as few masters as possible, as thereby their individual gains are\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\n  (4.) Competition is created among the Navigation schools and their\r\neducational staffs. The result of each examination should be allowed to\r\nbe published in the local papers, and the results of the examinations at\r\nall the Navigation schools should be made known at each school.\r\n\r\n  (5.) The inspector and the Department can see at a glance whether any\r\nNavigation school has neglected any subject. The masters could not evade\r\nthe rigor of this test by any artifice.\r\n\r\n  (6.) The boys will be induced generally to enter into the spirit of\r\nthe competition, which will have the best effect. A few only can win the\r\nprizes and exhibitions, but all can contribute by their exertions to the\r\ncomparative success of their school.\r\n\r\n  (7.) The local committee and the neighborhood would enter into the\r\nspirit of the struggle.\r\n\r\n  X. _A distinctive Dress or Badge is calculated to have a very good\r\neffect on the Navigation Schools._\r\n\r\n  The Trinity Board at Hull gives to 80 boys in the Navigation school a\r\nneat uniform (blue jacket, blue and white trousers, and blue cap.) This\r\nhas a capital effect on the boys, gives them an esprit d’ecole, and acts\r\nas a restraint on their conduct outside the schools.\r\n\r\n  XI. _In Navigation Schools great pains should be taken to ensure\r\npunctual attendance on the part of the boys._\r\n\r\n  I beg to suggest that the best form of registers be provided, and that\r\nit be made imperative that the register be strictly kept in all the\r\nschools, and that the following practice be universal instead of\r\npartial, viz., that any boy arriving late is expected to produce a\r\nwritten authority from the master of his school or his parents for his\r\nabsence. Prizes for good attendance have been found very useful in\r\nprimary schools. I beg to suggest one prize of 10_s._, three of 5_s._,\r\nand five of 1_s._ every half-year, or 3_l._ a year in a school of 100\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nCapt. Ryder recommends that the daily record of attendance, proficiency,\r\nand conduct, be posted up on the walls of the school every week, month,\r\nhalf-year, and year, as well as the names of all prize boys.\r\n\r\nCapt. Ryder goes into detail of the estimates of receipts and payments,\r\nand makes the education of each boy cost the Department about £2 10_s._\r\nper boy per annum. The whole expense of teaching and clothing at the\r\nHull School averages a little more than £6 per boy per annum.\r\n\r\n  _Obstacles to the success of Navigation Schools._\r\n\r\n  The principal obstacles in the way of success, in addition to the\r\ninefficiency of the schools, the absence of prizes, &c., are three in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n  It is my firm belief that if the Department assist liberally the\r\nestablishment of navigation schools, placing them on a proper footing,\r\nand stating that they are schools established for the sole purpose of\r\ngiving special instruction in scientific subjects to boys intended for\r\nthe Royal Navy and the Commercial Marine, these three obstacles will\r\ngradually vanish. They are,--\r\n\r\n  (I.) _A disinclination on the part of shipowners to enter boys._\r\n\r\n  In reply to my inquiries the owners of steamers stated, “We don’t want\r\nboys, who eat as much as men, are of very little use, and give a great\r\ndeal of trouble; we want men.”\r\n\r\n  Steam having superseded the use of sails to a great extent, boys, who\r\nin sailing vessels are invaluable for light work aloft, are not valued\r\nin steamers.\r\n\r\n  Many of the sailors, so-called, that we find in steamers differ very\r\nlittle from landsmen, except that they are not sea-sick, they can take\r\nthe wheel and pull an oar. To all the valuable qualities of a true\r\nsailor, which were developed by and almost entirely due to his work\r\naloft, viz., agility, readiness of resource, indifference to all danger\r\nthat may be escaped by bodily activity, as distinct from that solid\r\ncourage which all Englishmen possess, the steam sailor can lay slight\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\n  In the Royal Navy we want the superior class of sailors, and if\r\npossible those alone. The partial substitution of steam for sails, while\r\nit has injured our own sailors has, in the same way and for the same\r\nreason, injured those in the commercial marine, on whose aid and support\r\nwe may at any time be thrown for a supply of seamen.\r\n\r\n  It is most important, therefore, that every impulse should be given to\r\nkeep up in the commercial navy both the quantity and quality of the\r\nseamen; it is much to be regretted, therefore, that the same\r\ndisinclination to take boys, although fortunately in a less degree,\r\nexists among the shipowners of sailing vessels.\r\n\r\n  Lads enter on board merchant ships, some as apprentices, some as boys.\r\n\r\n  In the employment of the larger shipowners apprenticeships are highly\r\nvalued.[9] The proportion of apprentices to tonnage at present is about\r\n1 to 200 tons. Before the repeal of the navigation laws, it was by Act\r\nof Parliament 1 to every 100 tons.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: The value attached to an apprenticeship varies\r\n    largely with the employs, the port, &c. Mr. Green charges 180_l_\r\n    for a four-years’ apprenticeship as a midshipman. Large shipowners\r\n    at Glasgow and elsewhere pay 35_l_ for a similar term to a common\r\n    apprentice]\r\n\r\n  The disinclination to enter boys will, I believe, gradually vanish\r\nwhen the attention of the shipowners, as a body, is attracted to the\r\nvaluable class of boys who will attend the Navigation schools, for they\r\nwill be induced to reflect, that although at first sight it may appear\r\nto be more economical to enter no boys or apprentices, or a very few\r\nonly, and those at very low wages,[10] yet that by so doing they are\r\ncontributing indirectly, but yet surely and certainly, to the\r\ndeterioration of the whole class of seamen, and to the ultimate injury\r\nof the ship-owning interest.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: Owing to the low rate of wages referred to, large\r\n    numbers of apprentices run away every year, after they have served\r\n    a portion of their time.]\r\n\r\n  (II.) _A disinclination on the part of parents to send their boys to\r\nsea._\r\n\r\n  While sailors are, what they frequently are at present, not the most\r\nmoral or respectable members of society, it is probable and natural that\r\nmany parents would regret their sons’ choice of the sea as a profession.\r\n\r\n  But as sailors and masters improve by the aid of navigation schools,\r\nwhere they will be instructed in their youth, and are received in\r\nsailors’ homes at every port where their vessels touch, this class of\r\nobjections will gradually become obsolete; and the profession of the\r\nsailor will take its proper place by that of the high skilled mechanic\r\nas one of the noblest professions a working man’s son can adopt, being\r\nalso one of the highest paid; 3_l._ and 4_l._ a month besides victuals\r\nand medical attendance being the not uncommon emoluments of a merchant\r\nseaman. Moreover, the profession of a sailor, if he is a steady man, may\r\nbe rendered both healthy, improving, and entertaining, and acts most\r\nbeneficially on the character and temper. Steam and science are rapidly\r\ndiminishing the longest voyages, and long periods of absence, one of the\r\nnot unnatural objections of a parent, are becoming the exception instead\r\nof the rule.\r\n\r\n  The wish to go to sea is implanted by Providence, doubtless for the\r\nwisest purposes, in large numbers of the boys of these islands,\r\nfrequently in those who have never seen the sea. Those parents,\r\nministers, or schoolmasters who take upon themselves to thwart this\r\nnatural and laudable wish, going the length, as they frequently do, of\r\ntreating the boy’s desire, as an evidence of a vagabond and depraved\r\ntaste, may be fairly charged with the responsibility of the boy’s\r\nimmoral and depraved life, if such unfortunately is the result of his\r\ngoing to sea, for his naval career is probably commenced by running away\r\nfrom home, and he thus severs all those domestic ties which conduce so\r\nmuch to the preservation of purity of life and manners.\r\n\r\n  This conduct on the part of parents should be deprecated by every one\r\nwho has the best interests of his country at heart.\r\n\r\n  Every respectable and well conducted boy who desires to go to sea\r\nshould be aided and assisted to do so, and this course should be\r\nsystematically adopted throughout the country. The Government, by the\r\nsupport of navigation schools, show their opinion on this subject. It\r\nonly remains for the schools to be put on a proper and liberal footing,\r\nworthy of the Government and of the object which they are intended to\r\nserve. When this is done, the profession of the sailor will be rescued\r\nin the minds of the lower classes from all the odium which at present\r\nsurrounds it.\r\n\r\n  (III.) _A disinclination on the part of boys to go to sea._\r\n\r\n  This disinclination exists in some ports and not in others; it will\r\ndecrease wherever it exists when Navigation schools, established on a\r\nliberal footing, offering the inducements I have suggested, are placed\r\nnear the docks in every seaport town of any size or importance. It is\r\nadvisable that the schools should be so placed that the boys can when\r\nout of the school play about among the shipping, witness and long to\r\nimitate the evolutions of the sailors aloft, &c.\r\n\r\n  An attractive evening class will have to be established for the\r\ninstruction of boys who have to work for their livelihood during the\r\nday, and for apprentices. I have proposed that half the fees be given to\r\nthe educational staff, to insure their taking a direct pecuniary\r\ninterest in the evening class.\r\n\r\n  In concluding this report, I wish to state, that I am fully impressed\r\nwith the great benefit that the establishment of good Navigation schools\r\nwould confer directly on the Royal Navy, the Commercial Marine, and the\r\ncountry; and that I see every reason for believing, that if the schools\r\nare placed on a proper footing, the classes will be largely attended,\r\nand the schools will answer every purpose for which they are\r\nestablished. The limited number of thirty Navigation schools, which I\r\nhave suggested, should be forthwith established, although only\r\nprofessing to assist in providing a sufficient supply of educated young\r\nmen to fill up the vacancies among the masters and mates, yet can not\r\nfail to tell with the best effect on the commercial marine generally.\r\nFor these well-educated lads, who, after leaving the Navigation schools,\r\nhave to struggle through that large body, the seamen of the commercial\r\nmarine, before they can win the prizes of their profession, must raise\r\nthe tone of the class through which they pass.\r\n\r\n  If the thirty schools are established, and after two or three years\r\nare evidently working well, it will be worth considering whether more\r\nschools of a simpler and less expensive character should not be\r\nestablished to educate a sufficient number of lads fully to supply the\r\nvacancies in the seamen class.\r\n\r\n  The alterations I have proposed in the mode of payment of the\r\neducational staff are those upon which I desire to lay the most stress;\r\nthey have had but one object in view, the making it the personal\r\npecuniary interest of each member of the staff to devote himself\r\nzealously to those duties, and to no other, which the Department wishes\r\nhim to perform. In individual cases, we might appeal to higher motives\r\nthan these, but in dealing with a body of men, however upright and\r\nconscientious, I am firmly convinced that there is no safer course than\r\nthe appealing to the lower motive in aid of the higher.\r\n\r\nThe plan of payment of the teachers of navigation schools generally,\r\npresented by Capt. Ryder, was substantially adopted by the Department\r\nhaving charge of this, class of schools, in 1860, but was changed to the\r\nfollowing Minute in April, 1863, on the recommendation of Capt.\r\nDonnelly, for the purpose of restricting the efforts of the teacher, and\r\nthe industry of the scholars, to the subject of Mathematics, Navigation,\r\nNautical Astronomy, and the Use of Instruments, leaving general\r\nelementary studies to be mastered in other schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nAID TO NAVIGATION SCHOOLS AND CLASSES.\r\n\r\n  I. Payments will be made by the Department only on the results of\r\ninstruction in the following subjects:\r\n\r\n    1. Mathematics, including such portions of Algebra, Geometry,\r\n      Mensuration, Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, Logarithms, as far\r\n      as necessary for understanding Navigation and Nautical Astronomy.\r\n    2. General Navigation.\r\n    3. Nautical Astronomy.\r\n    4. Physical Geography.\r\n    5. Steam and the Steam Engine.\r\n\r\n  II. The payments will be made to those teachers only who have taken\r\ncertificates as qualified to teach the above studies.\r\n\r\n  III. Examination for teachers will be held annually in November, in\r\nSouth Kingston, Dublin and Edinburgh. The traveling expenses of\r\ncandidates if successful will be paid.\r\n\r\n  IV. Examination for students will be held\r\n\r\n  (1.) The adults, seamen and others, at the seaport towns where local\r\nMarine Boards are formed and are prepared to undertake them from year to\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n  (2.) The youths, in inland towns once a year, the examination forming\r\npart of the general May Science examination will be held simultaneously\r\nall over the kingdom where local committees are formed to conduct them,\r\nthe examination papers being supplied by the Science and Art Department.\r\n\r\n  V. The successful candidate will be classed as passed with honorable\r\nmention, third, second, and first grade certificates. In the three last,\r\na certificate will be given to that effect. The grades of success may be\r\nimproved at any future examination.\r\n\r\n  VI. The teacher will receive one, two, three, four or five pounds,\r\naccording to the class of success of his pupils, on the condition that\r\nthe pupil, if a boy, shall have received forty lessons, at least, from\r\nthe teacher, and then goes to sea, and if an adult at sea, then he shall\r\nhave received twenty lessons, at least.\r\n\r\n  VII. Should the pupil have been previously examined and payment made\r\non his account, the twenty or forty lessons, as the case may be, must\r\nhave been given since that examination, and the payment to the teacher\r\nwill be the difference between that sum previously paid and the amount\r\nfound due on the grade then taken.\r\n\r\n  VIII. A local committee must in all cases be formed, and from them the\r\nteacher will receive the necessary vouchers.\r\n\r\n  IX. The sum above fixed can only be considered experimental, and may\r\nbe altered from year to year.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE AND ENGINEERING.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction at the Royal College of Naval Architecture and\r\nMarine Engineering at South Kensington was originally in subjects the\r\nsame as at Portsmouth, but after careful observation of what could be\r\naccomplished in connection with practical instruction and observation in\r\nthe dock-yards, the subjects have been redistributed, and the number of\r\nsessions increased.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ year embraces mathematics, practical ship-building (laying\r\noff work), chemistry and metals, machinery, steam and its management,\r\nphysics, drawing, and French.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ year embraces the same subjects, with the addition of heat,\r\nand strength of materials.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ year includes the same subjects still further pursued.\r\n\r\nA _fourth_ year was added to the course in 1868, and the whole scheme in\r\nits details has not yet been fully tested.\r\n\r\nA portion of each year is spent in the dock-yards in practical work,\r\nunder the superintendence of officers in charge of different departments\r\nof the local service.\r\n\r\nAt the close of each session of theoretical study, a rigid examination\r\nis instituted, and promotion from class to class, and final graduation\r\nwith the diploma of Associate or Fellow is awarded on the results.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 there were 30 students (15 engineers and 15 shipwrights) sent by\r\nthe Admiralty, and receiving their instruction free; and 10 outside or\r\nordinary students (6 engineers and 8 in naval construction), a total of\r\n40 students.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS AND PRACTICAL TRAINING FOR NAVAL ENGINEERS.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the higher theoretical instruction in Naval Construction,\r\nSteam, and Marine Engineering, and kindred branches, at South\r\nKensington, and to the candidates for assistant engineers, furnished by\r\nthe numerous marine engine factories, and ocean steamers, to which young\r\nmen resort to acquire a practical knowledge of their duties, the\r\nAdmiralty have established in the dockyard schools at Portsmouth,\r\nDevonport, and Sheerness, courses of study and practical training, and a\r\nsystem of test examinations, for the express purpose of securing a body\r\nof educated and skillful engineers, to meet the demands of this\r\ndepartment of the service.\r\n\r\nBoys between the ages of 15 and 16, can enter their names as applicants\r\nwith the Superintendent of the dockyards, and if they can pass the\r\nmedical examination and give evidence of good character, they are\r\nexamined twice a year by the Civil Service Commissioners in Arithmetic,\r\nincluding fractions, square and cube roots; Algebra, including quadratic\r\nequations; Euclid (six books), spelling, writing, and correct oral use\r\nof the English language, translations from the French or Spanish\r\nlanguage, and geography. A certain number, according to the vacancies,\r\nwho stand highest in the competitive examination, are received for six\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nA portion of time is spent, by the boys, on their admission, in the\r\nfactories and drawing office, the foundries, the smitheries, and other\r\nshops to acquire a general knowledge of the work done in them. They are\r\ninstructed in the parts, construction and working of marine engines and\r\nboilers, and the practical use of the various instruments in the engine\r\nroom, including the indicator. They attend regularly for a portion of\r\nthe day the dockyard schools, and are examined twice a year by the\r\nDirector of Naval Education; and in the final examination they must gain\r\n2,000 marks out of the 2,650 (the aggregate of the marks assigned to\r\neach study), of which more than three-fourths must be in the properties\r\nof steam, mechanics, hydrostatics, plain trigonometry, and good conduct\r\nand industry, to obtain a first-class certificate of qualification. If\r\nhis knowledge of steam-machinery, and his good conduct and skill as a\r\nworkman, is certified to by the Chief Engineer, a first-class candidate\r\nis fully qualified for the appointment of assistant engineer. The most\r\nintelligent of this class are eligible for a four years’ additional\r\ncourse in the Royal School in South Kensington, where they study seven\r\nmonths in the year, the other five being spent in practical application\r\nof principles in the drawing rooms and workshops of the dockyards.\r\nThirty-two students entered this school from the Dockyard Schools in\r\n1870-71.\r\n\r\nThe Royal School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering issue two\r\ngrades of diplomas. To gain the lowest, that of _Associate_, the\r\ncandidate must obtain a certain minimum of marks in the aggregate of all\r\nthe subjects, in practical engineering; the proportions and arrangements\r\nof engines, boilers, and propellers; strength of material; heat and\r\nsteam, as well as in arithmetic and mensuration, algebra, plane\r\ntrigonometry, elementary mechanics and hydrostatics, and engine drawing.\r\nTo obtain the second (the diploma of a _Fellow_) the candidate must\r\nproduce designs and estimates for building simple and compound engines;\r\ncalculate the power of engines and performance of vessels; strength of\r\nmaterial and principles of ship-construction, &c., as well as pass a\r\nsatisfactory examination in higher mathematics, physics, and natural\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nTRAINING SHIPS FOR SEAMEN IN THE ROYAL NAVY.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the Royal Navy is now limited to boys between the ages\r\nof 15 and 17, who present themselves at certain recruiting stations on\r\nboard of Receiving ships stationed in the principal ports of Great\r\nBritain, and who are found on examination to be in sound health, not\r\nbelow a certain standard of height, weight, and circumference of chest,\r\nof good character, and with a rudimentary knowledge of reading, writing,\r\nand arithmetic. After passing satisfactorily the required examination,\r\nwith the written consent of their parents and guardians they are entered\r\nand bound to Her Majesty as sailors until they arrive at the age of\r\ntwenty-eight, and then sent to one of the five Training Ships at\r\nDevonport (_Impregnable and Implacable_), Portsmouth (_St. Vincent_),\r\nFalmouth (_Ganges_), and Portland (_Boscawen_).\r\n\r\nIn each Training Ship the boys are divided into two classes--the First\r\nand Second. The First class is the upper division, into which those pass\r\nwho have been twelve months on board. Here they receive 7_d._ per day\r\n(instead of 6_d._ in the Second), and if they have passed a satisfactory\r\nexamination in seamanship, gunnery, and school work, they wear a badge,\r\nand are called Badge Boys, and enjoy the privileges of a Petty\r\nOfficer,--extra liberty on shore and exemption from dirty work, as well\r\nas increased pay.\r\n\r\nThe work on board of a Training Ship, consists of (1.) School duties,\r\nand (2.) Instruction and training in the practical work of a sea-going\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\n(1.) The school work is conducted by the Head-master and his assistants,\r\nunder the general control of the Chaplain and Naval Instructor. The boys\r\nare put into four divisions, irrespective of the classification of First\r\nand Second, which has reference to the time they have been on board.\r\nHaving a knowledge of reading and writing when they enter, they are\r\ntaught arithmetic and geography, and become quite expert in elementary\r\nstudies. Each division is subjected to a searching examination four\r\ntimes a year, by the Captain, and twice a year by the Inspector of Navy\r\nSchools, who reports direct to the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n(2.) The Training work, includes all branches of the service required of\r\na sailor, and a familiarity with every part of the vessel and her\r\nrigging; the names and uses of the masts and yards; knotting and\r\nsplicing; the use of the helm and needle; the compass; all the various\r\nniceties of rigging; the way to reef and furl; to make, shorten, and\r\nshift sails; and the meaning of the various words of command. To go\r\nthrough with quickness and precision all these various subjects, the\r\nboys are divided into sections, each under a regular teacher. The\r\nlessons are short, but frequent, and the repetition is continued till\r\nthe right way becomes a habit. A portion of the boys are taught flags,\r\nand the various systems of signaling. All are taught swimming, and how\r\nto rescue a man overboard, before they go to sea. To perfect the boys in\r\nrowing, sailing, and managing boats, a number of different descriptions\r\nis attached to each Training Ship. A Brig is also provided which is\r\nplaced under the command of a lieutenant, to cruise daily with a party\r\nof boys, who perform all the work, under an experienced sailor. Those\r\nwho have been at school for six months are sent off for two or three\r\nweeks at a time to get accustomed to real sea work. After an experience\r\nof two months in a Brig, the boys return to the Training Ship for\r\nfurther drill as a preparation for sea service on board of naval\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nBoys who show an aptitude for the use of tools are formed into a special\r\nclass to be trained for ship-carpentering. And to give the practical\r\nknowledge, a small ship (the _Circe_) is fitted up as a workshop, and is\r\nattached to the _Impregnable_, at Devonport.\r\n\r\nThe training of the British sailor is not limited to seamanship, but\r\neach boy is now conducted with great attention through a complete course\r\nof gunnery instruction. This course is divided into four sections.\r\n\r\n  1. The Handspike drill, and manning boats’ sides.\r\n  2. Pointing, sponging and loading. Rifle drill.\r\n  3. Pointing, dismounting and mounting. Sword Exercise.\r\n  4. Independent firing; quick and broadside firing; shifting,\r\n    breechings, trucks, and trigger lines, bow and quarter firing;\r\n    and securing a lower deck gun.\r\n\r\nOn leaving a Training Ship about half the boys go through a course of\r\nPractical Gunnery, to enable them to aim and accustom them to firing\r\nshot and shell, on board of a ship specially fitted up for their use.\r\n\r\nIn few schools of any grade is the occupation of the pupils more\r\nincessant, but the routine is so diversified, that the lads are in high\r\nhealth and spirits during their entire training.\r\n\r\nSCHOOL SHIPS FOR DESTITUTE CHILDREN IN SEAPORTS\r\n\r\nIn 1856 the frigate _Akbar_ was handed over by the Admiralty to a Board\r\nof Managers in Liverpool, and in 1858, the frigate _Venus_, to the\r\nMarine Society in London, to be fitted up and occupied by a class of\r\nboys, who were found hanging about the docks, and were fit candidates\r\nfor police and reformatory treatment. In these ships successive classes\r\nof lads--in the former an average of 70, and in the latter, of 140, each\r\nyear have received the ordinary elementary school instruction, and in\r\naddition, have been trained to the ordinary routine of a seaman’s life.\r\nIn due time a majority of them, rescued from bad influences, and lifted\r\non to a higher plane of intelligence, have been put on board of merchant\r\nvessels, to work their way up into positions of good pay and\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the Admiralty turned over to a Board of Management (charged by\r\nthe Poor Law with providing schooling for destitute and pauper children)\r\nin the Forest Gate District, composed of three of the eastern parishes\r\nof London, a fine wooden man-of-war, the _Goliath_, of 84 guns, rendered\r\npowerless for the service, by the progress of modern naval construction.\r\nThe ship was fitted up as a nautical and industrial school, at a cost\r\ntrifling compared with that of a new building, site, and equipment for\r\nthe same number, and, with its complement of 400 lads born to poverty\r\nand almost predestined to vice and crime, anchored off Gravesend.\r\nFortunate in its superintendent, Captain Bourchier, of the Royal Navy,\r\nand his staff of industrial and book instruction, these lads (increased\r\nduring the year to 450) have been subjected to a daily nautical drill\r\nand school course, which give great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFrom an official statement published in the London Times (Oct. 11,\r\n1871), it appears that out of 449 boys received on board since the\r\n_Goliath_ took up her station, 16 have gone into the Royal Navy, and in\r\na few weeks 40 others will be in readiness; 13 have gone to sea in\r\nmerchant ships, and more berths are promised shortly; 25 have found\r\ndesirable situations on shore or been discharged to their friends.\r\nBesides the regular elementary school studies in which all engage for\r\nfour hours, and seamanship which is taught to all, 115 are under\r\ninstruction in the bands, of which there are four on board, in addition\r\nto a drum and fife band. There are 160 treble and second singers; and\r\nconcerts, vocal and instrumental, are given by the young performers. For\r\nyoung musicians there is a demand in the army, and a list of 30 adepts\r\nhave been sent to the Horse Guards. There is a swimming bath attached,\r\nand 185 have been taught to swim. Out of a fund raised by subscription,\r\nprizes are given, the first distribution of which is thus described:\r\n\r\n  The prizes, of which about 100 were given away--and Captain Bourchier\r\nsaid he wished heartily that he had a prize for every boy, for “there\r\nwas not one black sheep among them”--were awarded according to a system\r\ncalculated to stimulate the better feelings as well as the intelligence\r\nof the boys. Thus, while there were prizes for seamanship, for smartness\r\naloft, for the best sail-makers, best coxswains of boats, best tailors,\r\nshoemakers, carpenters, painters, buglers, &c., there were also prizes\r\nfor the best swimmers, the best captain of messes, for the boys who kept\r\ntheir clothes or band instruments in the best order, one for the boy who\r\nhad attended most carefully to the sick, and two for the most popular\r\nboys in the ship. The latter prizes had been awarded according to a\r\nspecies of informal and unconscious _plébiscite_ on the part of the boys\r\nthemselves. There were five “popular boys” nominated; for one of\r\nthese--a small, dark, round-faced urchin--every boy in the ship voted;\r\nthe next on the list had a little over 50 per cent. of the crew in his\r\nfavor; and if names be any guide to nationality both these boys ought to\r\nhail from the sister island. To five of the boys silver medals were\r\ngiven for special good conduct, and these enjoyed the distinction of\r\nstanding in the front row and having their honors fastened on by Miss\r\nBourchier, daughter of the Captain Superintendent, the general\r\ndistribution of books being made by Mr. Brushfield, chairman of the\r\nBoard of Managers. As the little fellows came up to the table it was\r\nimpossible not to remark what a difference existed between recent\r\narrivals in the school and those who had been a few months or even a few\r\nweeks on board the _Goliath_. The school records show that, though\r\ncommonly feeble and stunted in growth when they embark, numbers of them\r\nhave since grown two and three inches in height, and as much as two\r\ninches round the chest. At Gravesend mariners know that the salt water\r\nmingles with the fresh; the process is silent, but not the less real.\r\nAnd in the _Goliath_, as in the tide itself, a change may be traced,\r\nworking quietly but just as surely, in the _physique_ and characters of\r\nthe boys on board. The constraint, depression, and helplessness lurking\r\nin all pauper boys lifts and melts away by little and little. In its\r\nplace come the frankness, courage, and love of adventure natural to\r\nEnglish boys who live near the sea. Every thing on board encourages a\r\ncheerful, self-reliant tone: the music, good food, good air, alternate\r\nhours of work and play, care, and strict discipline--these are the\r\nelements in the midst of which they live. The boys make every thing for\r\nthemselves. Even the neat Hussar uniform in which band No. 1 plays on\r\nthe quarter-deck has been cut out and made on board. The form of\r\npunishment held in most awe is to be forbidden to row in the boats.\r\nMoreover, they one and all feel that they have a future. Taking into\r\naccount the advantages, physical and educational, which the boys\r\nreceive, it would not be placing too high a value upon the training in\r\nthe _Goliath_ to estimate it in the case of each boy at 50_l._ a year.\r\nYet the actual charge made to other unions is 6s. 6d. a week.\r\n\r\nThe editorial notice of this enterprise concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n  Thus, beside the regular supply of trained sailor boys who may be\r\nexpected to take to the navy--we are told the punishment most dreaded on\r\nboard the _Goliath_ is being forbidden to row in the boats--there will\r\nbe a considerable residue brought up to steady work on shore, to skilled\r\nlabor and occupations which ought to secure them in after life a decent\r\nsubsistence, and a position far above the slough of hopeless and\r\nhelpless poverty in which they were born.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SCHOOLS, AND INSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nFOR THE MERCANTILE AND MILITARY MARINE.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe necessities of the maritime service in France, public and private,\r\nmilitary and commercial, have created a system, or at least a series of\r\nspecial schools for children whose parents are occupied on the sea, or\r\nyouths preparing for the exigencies of naval affairs, several of which\r\nwe will proceed to describe, with the aid of official documents,[11]\r\nwithout reference to the chronological order in which they have been\r\ninstituted. The system includes\r\n\r\n   1. Nautical School for the Orphans of Sailors.\r\n   2. The Inflexible and other School-ships.\r\n   3. Naval Apprentice Schools at the government naval stations.\r\n   4. School for Boatswains and Shipmasters.\r\n   5. School for Naval Engineers and Stokers.\r\n   6. Naval Drawing School.\r\n   7. Schools of Navigation and Hydrography.\r\n   8. Naval School at Brest.\r\n   9. School of Naval Architecture at Paris.\r\n  10. School of Marine Artillery.\r\n  11. School of Hydrography.\r\n  12. Naval School of Medicine and Pharmacy.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: Official Report on Paris Industrial Exhibition of\r\n    1866, group X. Official programmes of the several schools\r\n    noticed.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the schools above enumerated, several of which will be\r\ndescribed in detail, the French government has now under consideration\r\nthe establishment at Paris of a Central School of Commerce and\r\nNavigation. The instruction, while it will be special, will not be\r\ntechnical, and will be designed for young persons who propose to enter\r\neither the military or mercantile marine, leaving the practical details\r\nof the particular branch of the service to be acquired elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA system of maritime conscription for recruiting the navy, and strict\r\nregulations requiring special instruction in masters and mates of all\r\nmercantile vessels, are in force in France.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAUTICAL SCHOOL FOR ORPHANS OF SAILORS.\r\n\r\nFormerly, when the children of sailors were obliged at the age of seven\r\nto leave the asylums (_salles d’asile_,) which are open to them with\r\nsuch liberality, they had to stay for six years in the primary schools\r\nbefore, they were admitted to the “school for young sailors” (_école des\r\nmousses_,) where their professional education commenced. This state of\r\nthings, entirely satisfactory when the child belongs to a family, is\r\ndifferent when it is an orphan. Then there is a void to be filled.\r\n\r\nAn imperial decree, published Nov. 15th, 1862, at the suggestion of the\r\nMarquis of Chasseloup Laubat, provides for this want by furnishing at\r\nBrest an institution for the orphans of the navy, and placing it under\r\nthe especial protection of Her Majesty, the Empress. Vice-Admiral, Count\r\nde Gueydon, gave all his care to the organization of this especial\r\nschool, which was intended to gather the orphans of seamen, to place\r\nthem under the protection of the navy, to educate and instruct them that\r\nthey might follow in the steps of their fathers. They were placed under\r\nthe supervision of lieutenant Picard of the navy. Their general\r\ninstruction was confided to the _Brothers of the Christian Schools_, and\r\nthe “Daughters of Wisdom” (_filles de la sagesse_) were intrusted with\r\nall the cares which such young children require.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing to say in this place of the excellent primary\r\ninstruction given in this school, and will only notice briefly the\r\nspecial or professional instruction, which is imparted in a military\r\nstyle by divisions, subdivisions, companies, sections, squads commanded\r\nby masters, second masters, quarter-masters, and naval instructors.\r\nThere are three sizes (the low, middle, and high,) each of which is\r\ncommanded by a pupil.\r\n\r\nThe lessons which they receive consist of instruction in the management\r\nof sails, sailor’s practice, (_école de matelotage_,)the whistle, fife\r\nand drum, rowing, swimming, military practice, gun-practice,\r\nbayonet-practice, bats, _eillon_-drill, principles of music, gymnastics,\r\nand boxing. There is likewise given to them a physical and military\r\neducation, which developes their strength and gives them the ability to\r\nstudy more closely.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1867, there were in the school 415 pupils. Most\r\nof them are sent to the Seamen’s School (_école des mousses_,) when they\r\nhave attained the thirteenth year of their age; those who are not\r\nconsidered fit to serve in the navy are struck off the lists and\r\nreturned to their families.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Name of School.\r\n    3d Degree.\r\n      2d Degree.\r\n        1st Degree.\r\n\r\n  School of maneuvering on the naval gymnasium.\r\n    40 learn to mount to the mast-head and to hold themselves on\r\n    the sail-yards.\r\n      185 are just learning to take in the sails and the reefs,\r\n      and to make knots and splices.\r\n        190 take in the reefs and make knots and splices.\r\n\r\n  School of whistling.\r\n    20 learn to whistle.\r\n      10 give almost all the blasts of the whistle.\r\n        20 give all the blasts of the whistle.\r\n\r\n  School of rowing.\r\n    30 learn to row.\r\n      90 are just learning to row.\r\n        90 row.\r\n\r\n  Infantry school.\r\n    255 are drilled without arms.\r\n      20 are not fit yet to join the battalion.\r\n        140 are drilled in the gun-practice, bayonet-practice,\r\n        and form a battalion.\r\n\r\n  School of the fife and drum.\r\n    8 commence.\r\n      10 do pretty well.\r\n        7 do well.\r\n\r\n  School of gymnastics.\r\n    50 commence the elementary movements.\r\n      10 do pretty well.\r\n        30 do well.\r\n\r\n  School of music.\r\n    125 commence.\r\n      140 do pretty well.\r\n        150 do well.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the number of pupils that had entered and left\r\nthe school, up to Dec. 31, 1866:\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                                       | 1863. | 1864. | 1865. |1866.\r\n                                       +-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n                                       |       |       |       |\r\n  Number of pupils on the 1st January, | --    | 224   | 256   | 420\r\n                                       |       |       |       |\r\n  Entered during the year,             | 247   | 102   | 235   | 157\r\n                                       |       |       |       |\r\n               Total,                  | 247   | 326   | 491   | 577\r\n                                       |       |       |       |\r\n  Left during the year.                |       |       |       |\r\n    {Sent to the school ship,          |15}    |53}    |42}    |93}\r\n    {Sent back to their families,      | 6} 23 |15} 70 |26} 71 |67} 162\r\n    {Died in the hospital,             | 2}    | 2}    | 4}    | 2}\r\n                                       |       |       |       |\r\n  Present on the 31st of December,     | 224   | 256   | 420   | 415\r\n  -------------------------------------+-------+-------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nTHE INFLEXIBLE AND OTHER SCHOOL-SHIPS, AT BREST.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the children of sailors were placed on board the vessels\r\nof the fleet, where they lived in a state of servitude, and frequently\r\narrived at a mature age without being able to read or write, while the\r\ngasket of the sailor formed characters which would not yield to any\r\nmoral suasion. It is only since 1822 that they received, before being\r\nplaced on board the vessels, an elementary and professional instruction,\r\nand since that time the school-ship has become the principal seminary\r\nfor naval officers. The children must be at least twelve years old and\r\ntheir parents pledge themselves not to take them away from the school\r\ntill they have reached the age of eighteen.\r\n\r\nThe school-ship, first established at Brest in 1823, was transferred to\r\na corvette in 1836, to a frigate in 1851, and finally, in 1861, to the\r\nman-of-war, “_l’Inflexible_,” where it numbers at present 900 pupils\r\nfrom the age of 13 to 15. They remain here at least one and not more\r\nthan two years, and receive a primary and professional instruction.\r\nAfter leaving the school they are placed on vessels of the fleet, where\r\nthey continue to be under the special superintendence of the naval\r\ndepartment. Even here they go through a regular course of instruction,\r\ngiven by one of the officers, and have thus an opportunity to continue\r\nthe studies commenced on board the school-ship.\r\n\r\nIt would lead us too far here to enumerate in detail all the exercises\r\nperformed on board the _Inflexible_. It will suffice to say that besides\r\nschool instruction, the pupils are progressively accustomed to the\r\npractice of their profession, and learn everything which a sailor can be\r\ntaught on board a vessel; the washing and cleaning of the vessel and of\r\ntheir linen, the rigging of the mast, the maneuvering of sail-boats and\r\nrow-boats, which occupations fill the morning hours. After dinner, which\r\ntakes place at 11 o’clock, they go on board two brigs, where they study\r\nand execute alone all that constitutes the practical art of the sailor.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that these young sailors on board the\r\n_Inflexible_ get a liking for their occupation. Always in the open air,\r\nwith good clothes, varied bodily exercises and abundant food, they\r\nacquire robust health and a thorough knowledge of their profession.\r\nWhilst two companies tack, two others go through military, exercises\r\nwith rifles or guns, taking them to pieces, lashing the pieces, and in\r\nvarious ways maneuvering with the mountain howitzer, bayonet-fencing,\r\n&c. Some go to the sail-maker’s room and make hammocks. In 1857 there\r\nwere selected 16 sail-makers and 20 steersmen from those in each company\r\nwho showed most aptitude and taste for these specialties. This\r\nclassification of the young sailors according to their professional\r\nability, has produced very excellent results.\r\n\r\nMore recently still (by an imperial edict of Aug. 11, 1868,) a special\r\nsection of sailor apprentices has been formed on board the\r\n“_Inflexible_” for children, who have not the required size and\r\nstrength, (_taille_;) they are received into the school as apprentice\r\nsail-makers, carpenters and calkers. Pupils, after having reached the\r\nage of sixteen, are transferred to the school-ship _La Bretagne_.\r\n\r\nThe following table will give the statistics of this school to 1866.\r\n\r\n  [KEY]\r\n  NA  Number Admitted.\r\n  CoT Chief of the Topmast.\r\n  T   Topmen, (_gabiers_.)\r\n  FT  Flying Topmen, (_gabiers volants_.)\r\n  S   Supplementary.\r\n  L   Left the Navy or died.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------+--------------------------------------------\r\n                        |     |                 Left\r\n                        |     +-------+-----------+-----+-----+------\r\n    Date of Admission.  | NA  |  CoT  | T   | FT  |  S  | L   |Total\r\n  ----------------------+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n  Present April 1, 1861 |  493|       |     |     |     |     |\r\n  Admitted in 1861      |  275|   10  |  32 |  32 |  12 |  10 |   96\r\n     “     “  1862      |  712|   30  | 202 |  66 | 157 |  54 |  509\r\n     “     “  1863      |  579|   30  | 183 | 115 | 205 |  38 |  571\r\n     “     “  1864      |  580|   31  | 173 | 152 | 212 |  28 |  596\r\n     “     “  1865      |  545|   33  | 191 | 115 | 186 |  64 |  589\r\n     “     “  1866      |  540|   39  | 190 | 110 | 158 |  72 |  569\r\n  ----------------------+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n          Total         |3,724|  173  | 971 | 590 | 930 | 266 |2,930\r\n  ----------------------+-----+-------+-----+-----+-----+-----+------\r\n\r\nThe chambers of maritime commerce at Bordeaux, Cette, Marseilles,\r\nAjaccio, Havre, &c., have established similar nautical schools and\r\nplaced them under the supervision of the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVAL APPRENTICE SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThere have been since 1824, in every one of the five naval stations of\r\nFrance, elementary schools, intended to give to the apprentices in the\r\nvarious workshops a degree of elementary knowledge, on the system of\r\nmonitorial or mutual instruction. After some years of prosperity they\r\nwere abandoned, in consequence of the great aversion then generally\r\nmanifested against this method. The only one that remained was the\r\nschool at Rochefort, which was under the superintendence of the Brothers\r\nof the Christian Schools. But in 1828 and 1829, under the ministry of\r\nMartignac, the Baronet Hyde de Neuville ordered their reëstablishment.\r\nEvery one of these schools organized itself in its own way, and it was\r\nonly in 1851 that a decree of April 7th prescribes uniform regulations.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing to say here on these apprentice-schools, which are\r\nsimply primary schools for adults, to which are added special schools\r\nfor rowing. Their professional instruction is given in the various\r\nworkshops of the port, to which they have been assigned; the apprentice\r\nschool has had during the year 1866, 954 pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS OF BOATSWAINS.\r\n\r\nThe navy maintains schools called “_école de maistrance_” (_maistrance_\r\ncorps of under-officers of a ship,) where a certain number of workmen\r\nfrom the arsenals, chosen by open competition, receive the special\r\ntheoretical instruction required for the boatswain and foremen of the\r\nvarious workshops.\r\n\r\nThe origin of these establishments goes back as far as 1819. A circular\r\nfrom the Secretary of the Navy, the Baronet Portal, of Aug. 17th,\r\ndecreed the establishment, at the ports of Brest, Rochefort and Toulon,\r\nof special schools, in which a certain number of young workmen, destined\r\nfor the “board of shipmasters” (_maistrance_) and chosen from among the\r\nmost intelligent ones, should go through a theoretical and practical\r\ncourse of ship-building. The same circular contained a provisional\r\nregulation, giving the rules to be observed in these schools. The number\r\nof pupils in each was limited to 12, of which 8 should be carpenters, 1\r\npulley-maker, 1 blacksmith, 1 locksmith, 1 cooper, &c. These pupils\r\nshould be chosen from among the most intelligent and best-behaved\r\napprentices and young workingmen. They must know reading and writing,\r\nhave served two years in one of the ports, and be at least eighteen and\r\nnot more than twenty years old. The supervision of these schools was\r\nconfided to a naval engineer.\r\n\r\nWe have just given an outline of the programme of admission required in\r\n1819, because it is an official indication of the state of primary\r\ninstruction at this period; but the same regulation proves that it was\r\ntoo high yet, for the minister allowed, for the first two years, the\r\nlimit of age to be extended to 25 years.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction which was to be given, comprised the first\r\nelements of mathematics, elementary geometry, the first elements of\r\nrectilinear trigonometry and the first elements of statics, &c. This\r\ncourse of studies was to last two years, and a system of examination and\r\nprizes was organized.\r\n\r\nIt was generally supposed that such an organization would obtain great\r\nsuccess, and that the advantages which it presented would attract many\r\npupils. But such was not the case. The working classes at that time were\r\nvery much neglected, and there were very few who could read or write.\r\nMoreover the working men did not receive any pay whilst attending the\r\nschool, and thirdly, there was no opportunity for these young men to\r\nperfect themselves in the practical exercises of their profession during\r\nthe two years they studied the theory. The necessity of making some\r\nmodification became clearer every day, and this was done by a royal\r\ndecree of Feb. 9th, 1833.\r\n\r\nInstead of choosing the pupils, competition was substituted, and as the\r\nprimary instruction had advanced, candidates were required to be able to\r\nread fluently, to write neatly and correctly, and to be acquainted with\r\nthe rudiments of arithmetic; they must be workingmen of the first or\r\nsecond class, must be 21 years old and have served for three years in\r\nsome port; finally, they must furnish a certificate of their\r\nprofessional capacity, given by the foreman of their workshop, and\r\ncountersigned by the director.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction was to last two years, but the theoretical\r\nstudies were confined to the first year; the second year was exclusively\r\ndevoted to the practical application of the various professions of the\r\npupils, the number of whom was increased, the recruits coming to a great\r\nextent from the naval ports. Brest was to receive 24, Rochefort 14, and\r\nToulon 14; 52 in all, instead of 36.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the abolition of the limit of higher age, which gave a\r\nlarger number of pupils access to the school, the recruiting of pupils\r\nstill presented great difficulties. These were partly obviated by\r\nadmitting assistant boatswains, and even boatswains, who were paid by\r\nthe day. This measure was productive of very happy results; the number\r\nof pupils was soon increased and the studies were pursued with greater\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\nThe republican government, likewise, devoted its attention to these\r\nschools. A decree ordering a reörganization, was published April 23,\r\n1856, and is to the present day in force. The conditions of admission\r\nwere retained and extended to workingmen of the third class; the number\r\nof pupils assigned to each post was somewhat changed; the course of\r\ninstruction was to last two years; during the first, the pupils spent\r\nthe whole morning at the school, and during the second, only three\r\nmornings per week. Finally, it was agreed that the pupils were to be\r\npaid for the time which they devoted to the school, just as if they had\r\nworked in the dockyard.\r\n\r\nPROGRAMME OF INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the scientific instruction of more practical use, the\r\nfollowing programme was fixed for each year.\r\n\r\n_First year._--Arithmetic, logarithms, square cube roots; 2, geometry;\r\n3, elements of descriptive geometry; 4, elements of algebra up to\r\nequations of the second degree; 5, linear drawing; the course of\r\narithmetic and algebra lasted a month and a half, from 10 o’clock till\r\nnoon, instruction in drawing from 8 till 10. The two last months of the\r\nyear were employed in reviewing all that had been taught during the\r\nyear, and in preparing for the examination.\r\n\r\n_Second year._--1, Common mechanics; 2, workshop accounts; 3, drawing.\r\nThe course of mechanics and workshop accounts lasts two months. The\r\nhalf-day spent at the school is divided into three parts; the first is\r\noccupied in drawing, and lasts two hours; the second (either mechanics\r\nor workshop accounts) also two hours; the remainder of the time is\r\ndevoted to optional studies. When the course of mechanics and workshop\r\naccounts is finished, the pupils are divided into two sections; the\r\nfirst comprises the carpenters, and workmen of similar rank; the second\r\nthe mechanicians and workers in metal. During two months and a half the\r\nprofessor of mathematics teaches the section that works in wood the\r\napplication of geometry to the drawing of working plans, explains to\r\nthem all the details of the drawing of the frame, the stern, the bow and\r\npieces, &c. He teaches them to calculate the _deplacements_ from the\r\ncentre of the keel, or metre-centre. Finally, the pupils are taken to\r\nthe molding-loft, in order to trace there a vessel in its true\r\ndimensions under the directions of a drawing-master. The metal-workers\r\nreceive instructions from the professors of mathematics, on the property\r\nand application of steam; the functions of the various parts of a\r\nsteam-engine; the applications of descriptive geometry to the drawing of\r\nthe different parts of the steam-engine, &c.\r\n\r\nThe instruction in drawing receives in these schools all the attention\r\nwhich the development of naval construction demands. During the first\r\nyear the pupils learn successively shading strokes of different\r\nthickness, simple and dotted; the construction and use of ladders. After\r\nthis preparation, which applies to all, they execute professional\r\ndrawings; the carpenters, plans of vessels after a copy; the\r\nmechanicians, plans of steam-engines and steam-boilers, &c. The time\r\ndevoted to drawing during the second year is employed by the carpenters\r\nin drawing a fair copy of the complete furnishing material of a vessel,\r\nthe details of the masting, the capstan, the helm, &c.; by the\r\nmetal-workers in drawing a fair copy of the various machines. All these\r\ncourses of instruction have been attended with satisfactory results;\r\nmost of the pupils who have not been able to draw a straight line before\r\nentering the school, on leaving can draw in a creditable manner the\r\nworking-plan of a vessel as well as of the most complicated machines.\r\n\r\nFrom its foundation in 1819 till the end of 1862, the _Echo de\r\nmaistrance_ at Brest has been attended by 429 pupils, viz.:\r\n\r\n  275 pupils actually in the service, viz.: 34 pupils; 60 workingmen; 57\r\nassistant boatswains; 100 boatswains; 24 paid boatswains.\r\n\r\n  59 pupils died in the service, viz.: 5 pupils, 15 workingmen, 7\r\nassistant boatswains, 22 boatswains; 7 paid boatswains; 1 naval\r\nstorehouse-keeper.\r\n\r\n  95 pupils left or were discharged.\r\n\r\nTo get an idea of the manner in which the pupils pass the examination on\r\nleaving, it will be seen from the following table, which shows the\r\nresults in the school at Brest during the last five years, that the\r\ninstruction given has not been lost. The same is the case at Rochefort\r\nand Toulon.\r\n\r\n  --------+----------------------------------------------+--------\r\n          |         Number of pupils who have            | Total\r\n   Years. |           attended the school.               | number\r\n          +------------+----------+-----------+----------+   of\r\n          | With great | Success- | With good | Without  | pupils.\r\n          |  success.  |  fully.  |  results. |  result. |\r\n  --------+------------+----------+-----------+----------+--------\r\n    1862  |      6     |     5    |     13    |     3    |   27\r\n    1863  |      3     |     4    |     20    |     --   |   27\r\n    1864  |      5     |     5    |     15    |     4    |   29\r\n    1865  |      3     |     6    |     14    |     1    |   24\r\n    1866  |      6     |     9    |     14    |     --   |   29\r\n          +------------+----------+-----------+----------+--------\r\n   Total, |     23     |    29    |     76    |     8    |  136\r\n  --------+------------+----------+-----------+----------+--------\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL FOR NAVAL ENGINEERS, STOKERS, ETC.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of steam into navigation, it is indispensable to\r\nhave well-trained stokers and mechanicians, men who enjoy robust health,\r\ngreat presence of mind, prudence and an inventive genius when facing\r\ndifficulties, skill in working metals, a knowledge of elementary\r\nmathematics and its application to their labor. In order to prepare such\r\nmen, two special schools have been established by an imperial edict of\r\nSept. 24, 1860, one at Brest, on board the _Urania_, and another at\r\nToulon, on board the _Jena_. To be admitted to these schools, the\r\nconditions must be fulfilled which are required for the various grades\r\nin the _personnel_ of a steam vessel.\r\n\r\nIn order to recruit these schools, all the blacksmiths, braziers and\r\nweighers, (_ajusteurs_) who belong to the annual contingent of the army,\r\nmay be sent officially, or at their own request, to the ports of Toulon\r\nand Brest, to be incorporated in the companies of mechanics of the navy.\r\nCivilians are admitted by contracting a voluntary engagement as stokers.\r\nAll, however, must undergo an examination in manual labor, to show their\r\nphysical capacity.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction for stokers who are candidates for the grade\r\nof quartermaster, comprises, 1, arithmetic up to and including the rule\r\nof three, and square roots; 2, common geometry up to and including\r\nspherical bodies; 3, a concise knowledge of mechanics, and physics; 4,\r\ndescription and classification of steam-engines for vessels; the\r\nadjusting of their various parts, a concise knowledge of the property of\r\nmetals and their use; 5, the practical management of machines and\r\nsteam-boilers; 6, the repairing of machines.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this instruction attracts to the service of the navy\r\nmany intelligent and industrious young mechanics who would not enter it,\r\nbecause, not possessing the special knowledge required, they would not\r\nrun the chance of remaining for a long time in the lowest grade, viz.:\r\nthat of working stoker, the only one to which their attainments would\r\nallow them to aspire. In following this instruction, however,\r\nattentively and passing their examination successfully, they obtain the\r\nrank of pupil mechanicians, and even of quartermasters. In continuing\r\ntheir studies, they can rise still higher; their schools furnish them\r\nwith the means, if they wish to become second boatswains. To the\r\nknowledge already acquired are added: 1, arithmetical progression; 2,\r\nthe whole of planimetry; 3, theoretical mechanics and physics; 4,\r\ntheory, description, regulation, and construction of steam-engines and\r\nsteam-boilers; 5, the working and repairing of machines. By further\r\npursuing their studies and working diligently, they can rise from second\r\nto first boatswain, and may ultimately obtain the position of principal\r\nmechanician, with the rank of lieutenant on men-of-war, and even of\r\ncaptain on corvettes, if they became chief mechanicians.

At the foundation of the naval school\r\nat Augoulême in 1816, these drawing-schools were transferred to the\r\nshore, became less exclusive, and admitted to their gratuitous course\r\nall young men from these two great naval stations who wished to adopt\r\nthe naval profession. They have always been very largely attended.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS OF NAVIGATION AND HYDROGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nLong before the navy had acquired any importance, maritime commerce had\r\nbeen immensely developed. The coasting and ocean trade required\r\nexperienced and well-informed sailors. There were therefore in the\r\nprincipal seaports, gratuitous schools of navigation, whose aim was to\r\ndisseminate theoretical knowledge. These schools were well conducted\r\nfrom the year 1584, when Henry III issued the first ordinance on the\r\nsubject, by which boatswains and captains of merchant vessels had to\r\nundergo an examination of qualifications; but opportunities of\r\ninstruction were wanting at that time, and it was reserved for Louis\r\nXIII to fill this void.\r\n\r\nDuring the memorable siege of La Rochelle, Cardinal Richelieu became\r\nconvinced that the knowledge of a captain, to whom the State intrusts a\r\nmerchant-vessel, ought not to be confined to the most simple rules of\r\nthe art of navigation. He consequently, in January, 1629, published a\r\ndecree, ordering the establishment of schools of hydrography, open to\r\nall who intended to study navigation theoretically. The king himself\r\nengaged to maintain, at his own expense, a certain number of such\r\nschools, and encouragements were held out to all cities which would\r\nfound such schools. The professors of hydrography were detained to\r\nassist at the examinations of captains, boatswains and coxswains.\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin of the first professional instruction in navigation.\r\nHere, as in all institutions of learning, the instruction of manhood\r\nsucceeded that of youth. If the orders of Louis XIII were not as\r\ngenerally executed as they deserved, they were instrumental in producing\r\na certain number of learned hydrographers, some of whom became the\r\nauthors of the first treatises on navigation ever published in the\r\nFrench language.\r\n\r\nA decree of Louis XIV, (August, 1681,) another by Louis XV, (September\r\n14, 1764,) and third by Louis XVI, (January 1, 1786,) show that the\r\nancient monarchy did not lose sight of this branch of instruction. In\r\nthe last mentioned decree, the Marquis of Castries, Secretary of the\r\nNavy, united under one common law all these establishments, whose\r\norganization was far from uniform. The professors were in future chosen\r\nby competition. Two chairs of “hydrographic examiners” were created,\r\ncharged with the superintendance of the instruction, to assist at the\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\nA decree of the National Assembly, which became a law, August 16th,\r\n1791, decided that gratuitous schools of hydrography should be\r\nestablished at the expense of the State, in thirty-four different\r\nplaces. This decree was supplanted by others published a few years\r\nlater, further regulating the course of instruction.\r\n\r\nDuring the wars of the first Empire, Napoleon I never forgot to extend\r\nthe benefits of French institutions wherever his armies were victorious.\r\nTo this circumstance several foreign seaports owe their excellent\r\nschools of navigation.\r\n\r\nThe hydrographic instruction was completely reorganized by a royal edict\r\nof August 7, 1825, under the ministry of Count de Chabrol. This is still\r\nin force with but few modifications. One professor is charged with\r\ngiving instruction in each of the 42 schools of the Empire; two\r\nexaminers have charge of the general supervision of these schools, and\r\nhold the annual examinations.\r\n\r\nInstruction is gratuitous, and sailors can enter from the age of 13\r\nupwards, but they rarely attend them before they are 22 or 23 years old.\r\nThe professors, on five days of the week, impart instruction for four\r\nhours a day. There are two different courses; one superior and the other\r\nelementary; the first theoretical and practical, the other essentially\r\npractical. Wherever there is an observatory, the pupils are practiced in\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThe programme of the theoretical instruction comprises: for ocean\r\nvoyages, elements of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry,\r\nelements of astronomy, navigation, use of instruments and nautical\r\ntables, elementary knowledge of steam-engines, as applied to navigation,\r\nFrench composition; for the coasting-trade, elements of practical\r\narithmetic, geometry, practical navigation, elementary knowledge of\r\nsteam-engines, nautical calculations. The examinations are annual, and\r\nno one is admitted to the practical examination, unless he has reached\r\nthe age of 24, and has served five years on a French vessel. It\r\ncomprises rigging, management of sails, a knowledge of coasts, currents,\r\ntides, and gunnery. After the practical examination has been\r\nsuccessfully passed, the pupil must undergo the theoretical one.\r\n\r\nFor the results produced by these establishments, the average attendance\r\nof the schools of navigation, and the number of sailors, who have become\r\ncaptains or boatswains, we refer to the following tables.\r\n\r\n_Number of sailors who have attended the schools of hydrography from\r\n1849 to 1866; of candidates who have obtained the rank of “captain” for\r\nsea voyages, or “boatswain” for the coasting trade._\r\n\r\n  [KEY]\r\n  PS Pupils of the Schools.\r\n  AC (of the sea voyage.)

These schools were placed under the orders of the\r\nmaritime prefects of the two ports. In 1816, these two schools were\r\nabolished by decree, and a royal marine college was established at\r\nAngoulême. Several other changes took place, and in 1830 the college was\r\nreplaced by a naval school on board the _Orion_, an old 74; this vessel\r\nwas succeeded by several others, all of which have received the name of\r\nthe second school-ship, the _Borda_, named after Captain Borda, a naval\r\nofficer of great scientific and practical ability. The present ship is a\r\nnoble three-decker, pierced for 120 guns, was launched in 1847, and took\r\npart in the Crimean war.\r\n\r\nThe _Borda_ is stationed at Brest, and its rigging has been reduced to\r\nthat of a frigate. The forepart of the second gun-deck of the vessel\r\nstill retains something of its old character, and is provided with six\r\nguns on each side for practice. The other parts of the vessel have been\r\ncompletely altered; the decks have been cut away, so as to form two\r\nlarge lecture-rooms and two school-rooms. Not only the pupils but also\r\ntheir professors and most of the officers are lodged on board the\r\nvessel. On deck are specimens of various kinds of guns in use in the\r\nFrench navy, and a gymnasium. The quarter-deck, which is continued to\r\nthe mainmast, is divided, the forepart being appropriated to the pupils,\r\nand the aft to officers.\r\n\r\nCandidates are admitted to this school after a public examination, which\r\noccurs annually. For admission to the examination the applicant must\r\nprove his French birth--his being at least fourteen years of age and not\r\nover seventeen years, and his having no infirmity that disables him for\r\nmarine duty.\r\n\r\nThe requirements for admission are a knowledge of arithmetic, algebra,\r\ngeometry, plane trigonometry, applied mathematics, natural philosophy,\r\nchemistry, geography, the English language, drawing. The candidates must\r\nprepare a composition in French, a translation from Latin, an exercise\r\nin English, a numeral calculation in trigonometry, a geometrical\r\ndrawing, and an off-hand sketch of a head. There are two oral\r\nexaminations on the above studies, the second of which is not attempted\r\nif the first, which is elementary, is unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the _Borda_ is a full captain, and the instruction,\r\nwhich is practical as well as theoretical, is confided to eleven\r\nprofessors, of whom five belong to the hydrographic department, eight\r\nare full lieutenants, and one a principal engineer. The duties of the\r\nfive hydrographic professors are thus divided:--Two teach astronomy and\r\nnavigation, two analytical and mechanical science, and the last natural\r\nphilosophy and chemistry. The duties of the other professors are thus\r\narranged:--Two for literature, history and geography; two for the\r\nEnglish language; and two for drawing. The lieutenants direct four\r\ncourses of instruction, namely, naval architecture, the theory and\r\npractice of managing a ship, gunnery and small arms, with practice, and\r\nnautical calculations. The engineer professor teaches the theory and\r\nmanagement of steam-engines and mechanics. The other officers are a\r\ncaptain of a frigate, (second in command,) a chaplain, a financial and\r\nan administrative officer, and two medical men. Besides these, there is\r\na captain of gunnery and several under-officers of the marine and\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nThe school sessions commence on the first of October, and on that day\r\npromotions of the pupils are made in the various classes. Those who have\r\npassed two years of study in the ship are called _grand ancients_, rank\r\nwith naval aspirants of the second class, and are eligible to make a\r\nvoyage of circumnavigation in another vessel appropriated to that\r\npurpose; pupils who have been one full year in the _Borda_ are called\r\nancients, and the rest new boys, or in French naval language, _fistots_.\r\nThe boys have each a number, and in all the ordinary routine of the\r\nschool-ship, this takes the place of a name.\r\n\r\nThe elder pupils are employed as monitors over the younger, and each\r\nof the former has one or more allotted to him, not as a fag, but as a\r\nscholar, whom it is his duty to teach all he himself knows. It is said\r\nthat the system succeeds admirably, and that for the first few months\r\nthe instruction of the new comer is left almost entirely to his\r\n_ancient_; the new pupil thus escapes without difficulty many errors of\r\ndiscipline into which he would otherwise inevitably fall.\r\n\r\nThe discipline of the school is severe; the boys rise every morning, all\r\nthe year round, at five o’clock, stow away the hammocks in which they\r\nsleep, attend prayers, and then commence their morning’s work.\r\n\r\nThey are well fed, having coffee or chocolate in the morning, dinner\r\n(old style) at 12 o’clock, a lunch of bread (_goûter_) at 4.30, and\r\nsupper at 7.45, with bread _à discrétion_, and about four-tenths of a\r\npint of wine at each of the two principal meals.\r\n\r\nThe morning studies are devoted to science; those of noon to practice\r\nwith guns, or practical study, marine machinery, or drawing; and the\r\nevening to literature, the English language, or naval architecture. All\r\nthe studies are pursued on board, with the exception of natural\r\nphilosophy and chemistry, the professor of which has at his command in\r\nthe town the collection of instruments and chemicals, as well as the\r\nlecture-room and laboratory of the central pharmaceutical establishment.\r\nAt times, also, the pupils are taken to visit the vessels in process of\r\nconstruction, and the workshops in the arsenal, and to practice with\r\nsmall arms on shore.\r\n\r\nThere are eight boats attached to the _Borda_, and the pupils are\r\npracticed almost every day, and in all weathers, in rowing and sailing,\r\nunder the eye of an officer, who watches the exercises from on board a\r\nsmall steam-gunboat attached to the school. The ordinary studies of the\r\nschool end between six and seven in the evening, and the pupils turn in\r\nat nine o’clock for their eight hours’ rest.\r\n\r\nThursday and Sunday, as usual in France, are exceptional days, when,\r\nafter nautical calculations, (which are never omitted,) the elder pupils\r\nor ancients practice with small arms on shore, and the juniors are\r\ndrilled in the use of the sword, musket, and bayonet. After this they\r\nhave six hours’ hard work in maneuvering two small corvettes, provided\r\nfor the purpose, that belonging to the ancients being a screw-steamer.\r\n\r\nThe boys, as a rule, are at liberty on alternate Sundays, and the most\r\nadvanced every Sunday afternoon. This is a recent innovation; the pupils\r\nused to be free scarcely more than once a month; but this gave rise to\r\nmuch discontent and some disturbance, and the rule has, therefore, been\r\nmade less severe. In addition to this liberty, however, all the lads are\r\nallowed to see their friends for a short period during the exercises on\r\nshore on Sunday and Thursday mornings, and those who are not free on\r\nSunday are taken on shore for a change in the afternoon. During the\r\nsummer months the boys bathe in the sea.\r\n\r\nA peculiar custom exists in the school--the boys are allowed to smoke\r\nduring the hour of recreation after dinner, and at certain other times;\r\nand for this reason, that as it was found utterly impossible to stop the\r\npractice entirely, it was deemed better to recognize it in moderation,\r\nand thus stop its secret indulgence and the attendant danger of fire.\r\n\r\nThe punishments inflicted in the school are extra drill and confinement,\r\neither in a small cell or in a dark hole, with a regimen of bread and\r\nwater; for very grave offences, boys are dismissed or expelled. On the\r\nother hand, the marks for good conduct are numerous; there are several\r\nexaminations in the various classes during the nine months of the school\r\nyear, and those pupils who gain the greatest number of marks are called\r\n_élèves d’élite_, and wear a gold anchor on their collars, or, in the\r\ncase of the first twelve, two anchors; the pupil who has gained the\r\nlargest number of marks bears the high but merely nominal rank of first\r\nbrigadier, and he who enters the school with the greatest success at the\r\nexamination is called major. A general examination takes place at the\r\nend of the year, when the ancients who pass become aspirants in the\r\nnavy, and the juniors are raised to the upper class in the school; those\r\nwho fail in the examination are either sent back to their class, or\r\nrejected as unfit for the naval career. The first and second prizemen,\r\non quitting the school, receive each a quadrant in the name of the\r\nEmperor, and the third a telescope.\r\n\r\nThe elder pupils have nearly three months’ holiday, but the junior pass\r\na month on board another vessel, the _Bougainville_, for what is called\r\nthe summer campaign. This vessel, which was constructed specially for\r\nthe school, is a screw dispatch-boat with engines of 120 horse power;\r\nthe summer voyage is settled by the Minister of Marine, and includes a\r\nvisit and examination of the ports of L’Orient and Cherbourg, touching\r\nat some remarkable points of the French coast, sometimes casting anchor\r\noff the English coast, and sometimes running as far as Ferrol in\r\nGalicia.\r\n\r\nThe _grand ancients_, when their holidays are over, that is to say on\r\nthe first of October, join the _Jean Bart_, which makes an annual voyage\r\nof several months’ duration. This boat was built in 1852 and made its\r\nfirst voyage of this kind in 1864-5. She is an 80-gun ship, of the mixed\r\nclass, having engines of 450 nominal horse-power. In August of the\r\npresent year she will have completed her fourth and last voyage of\r\ncircumnavigation, another vessel, the _Donawert_, now being prepared to\r\nsucceed her. The upper gun-deck of the _Jean Bart_ is disarmed, and\r\nconverted for the use of a part of the officers and the pupils, who\r\nnumber about a hundred, and occupy eight cabins, each with two\r\nportholes; here the young men eat, and drink, and sleep, as well as\r\npursue their studies.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the _Jean Bart_ consist of a full captain in command, a\r\nsecond captain, a chaplain, ten lieutenants, one having charge of each\r\npupil’s cabin, or _poste_, as it is called, and two giving instruction\r\nin sailing and gunnery; a surgeon-major, who gives instructions\r\nrespecting the means of keeping a crew in health; two assistant-surgeons,\r\nan engineer, a drawing-master, and some others.\r\n\r\nThe Minister, as in the case of the summer cruise of junior pupils,\r\nsettles the course to be taken by the _Jean Bart_. Generally the West\r\nIndia islands are visited in the months of March and April, when the\r\npupils are principally exercised in hydrographical works off St. Pierre\r\nand Fort de France; in gunnery on board, and small-arms on shore; in the\r\ndaily management of boats for embarkation and disembarkation; and in the\r\nmanagement of sails in the intricate channels of the archipelago. They\r\nare shown, moreover, how to perform difficult operations, such as the\r\nunshipping of the rudder and bringing it on deck for examination,\r\nlifting a mast, &c. The pupils are required to keep written records of\r\nall such operations, and to illustrate the narrative when necessary with\r\ndrawings. When they visit foreign yards and arsenals, they are expected\r\nto give minute accounts of what they have seen there, and besides a\r\ndaily journal, to write critical notices of all the different machines,\r\nmethods of rigging, and maneuvers, which they have witnessed.\r\n\r\nThe difficult channel of the Isle St. Sebastian, off the coast of\r\nBrazil, that of the Bermudas, the river Hudson, and the coast of\r\nNewfoundland, are among the places selected to initiate the pupils in\r\nthe difficulties of navigation. At Annapolis, in the Chesapeake, a visit\r\nis paid to the National Naval School of the United States at the season\r\nwhen the general examinations take place in that establishment. The\r\nvoyage usually terminates with a visit to Cape Breton and some points of\r\nNewfoundland; the fisheries and drying-houses of St. Pierre and Miquelon\r\nare generally visited, and the _Jean Bart_ returns to Brest between the\r\n1st and 5th of August, having been absent ten months. A sailing brig\r\nnamed the _Obligado_ has lately been attached to the _Jean Bart_ as a\r\nsupplementary vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOL OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE AT PARIS.\r\n\r\nThe construction of ships and engines in the French naval service is\r\nintrusted to the Corps of Marine Engineering, (_Corps du Génie\r\nMaritime_,) consisting of 121 officers, viz., 1 inspector-general, 10\r\ndirectors of naval construction, 40 marine engineers, and 70 assistant\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\nThis corps is recruited from the graduates of the Polytechnic, and\r\nhaving passed satisfactorily the required examination for the public\r\nservice, are sent to the School of Application of Naval Engineering at\r\nParis, and to the dockyards, to learn their special business. The usual\r\nnumber in attendance is 30, and the annual cost of the school is about\r\n100,000 francs.\r\n\r\nThe course occupies two years and a-half--three winters in Paris and two\r\nsummers in the dockyards. The pupils having a good general education and\r\na complete special knowledge of mathematics and geometrical drawing, the\r\ncourses are from the start eminently practical.\r\n\r\nThe instruction in Paris during the first session consists of: 1, a\r\ncourse on construction; 2, on displacement and stability; 3, on strength\r\nof materials; 4, English; 5, free-hand drawing; 6, plan-drawing of\r\nvessels. During the second session it consists of: 1, a practical course\r\non steam-engines; 2, a theoretical course on steam; 3, applied\r\nmechanics, machines in general; 4, English; 5, accounts; 6,\r\nplan-drawing, ships and engines; 7, pictorial drawing. During the third\r\nsession: 1, course on stability, (2d part;) 2, on naval architecture; 3,\r\nnaval artillery; 4, technology of workshops, special to the navy; 5,\r\naccounts; 6, English; 7, plan-drawing, projects for ships; 8, free-hand\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\nIn the first year ship-building is taken up; in the second, the\r\nsteam-engine, and in the third the two are combined and completed. When\r\nin the dockyards, the pupils are placed under the order of the engineer\r\nin charge of works in execution, who sees that they are attentive to\r\ntheir duty, and have proper instruction. He also examines and certifies\r\nthe journals which the pupils have to keep. The director of the school\r\ngives each pupil detailed instruction to guide him in the choice of the\r\npractical work he shall attend to. The first summer is devoted to the\r\nconstruction of ships, the second to that of engines. The pupils select\r\nthe ports to which they will go, according to their standing in their\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two years and a half, the pupils are examined by a board,\r\nand if found qualified, they are appointed assistant engineers of the\r\nthird class. If they fail to pass, they may be allowed another year--but\r\nfailing in that, they are definitely rejected.\r\n\r\nThe private pupils, natives or foreigners, who to the number of eight\r\nare allowed to attend the course in Paris, may obtain permission to go\r\nthrough the whole practical course in one of the imperial dockyards, but\r\nare not subjected to the same discipline as the regular pupils. On\r\nleaving, they receive from the director a certificate of the course gone\r\nthrough, their talent and diligence.\r\n\r\nThe school is under the immediate orders of a Director of Naval\r\nConstruction, who is also one of the professors, and is assisted in the\r\nseveral branches taught by other professors, who are marine engineers,\r\nand a special teacher of drawing, and another of the English language.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARITIME CONSCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nThe French naval service is supplied by a system of conscription\r\nanalogous to that for the army. All persons, who reside on the coast,\r\nwhose labor is on the sea, or on navigable rivers reached by the tide,\r\nare enrolled on arriving at the age of eighteen, and are liable to be\r\nsummoned to the naval service until they are fifty, for an aggregate\r\nperiod of seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS OF MARINE ARTILLERY.\r\n\r\nThere is at Brest, Toulon, and L’Orient, schools of marine artillery,\r\nbesides floating schools at Brest and Toulon, for practice at firing at\r\na mark at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOARD OF HYDROGRAPHERS.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Hydrographers is located at Paris. Pupils who have\r\ncompleted the polytechnic course enter the corps with the rank of _élève\r\nhydrographe_, with the same rank and advantages as naval architects.\r\nThey are sent to the coast to make surveys, and after two years service\r\nin the field, and in office work under special instruction, become\r\nassistant hydrographers without further examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVY AND NAVAL EDUCATION IN FRANCE.\r\n\r\nI. MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL MARINE.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the French Navy is represented in the following\r\nstatistics taken from the Statesman’s Year Book for 1871: In 1780 the\r\nwar fleet consisted of 60 first-class ships, 24 second class, and 182\r\nsmaller vessels,--total 266 ships, with 13,300 guns, and 78,000 sailors.\r\nIn 1805, the number was reduced by casualties and neglect to 18\r\nmen-of-war, with 1,352 guns. In 1844 the whole force amounted to 226\r\nsailing vessels, and 47 steamers, with 8,639 guns and 24,513 sailors. In\r\n1855 the navy was reorganized, by the introduction of every new\r\nappliance of naval architecture, construction, and ordnance, with the\r\nfollowing results, in 1869-70:\r\n\r\n  Classes.             Number.  Horse-Power.  Guns.\r\n\r\n  1. Iron-clads,         62        28,150       672\r\n  2. Screw Steamers,    264        55,812     1,547\r\n  3. Paddle Steamers,    62         8,665       154\r\n  4. Sailing Vessels,   113          ....       672\r\n                         ---       ------     -----\r\n  Total,                 401       92,627     3,045\r\n\r\nThe iron-clads _Magenta, Solferino, Couronne, Normandie, Invincible_,\r\nand the cupola ship _Taureau_, are plated, with rifle breech-loading\r\nguns, and are not surpassed in strength and destructive armament by the\r\nships of any other navy.\r\n\r\nEleven of the smaller iron-clads, besides the ordinary floating\r\nbatteries, are so constructed that when out of service they can be taken\r\nto pieces, packed up and stored away at the arsenal of Toulon.\r\n\r\nThe navy is manned by a marine conscription, which dates back to 1683.\r\nFor this purpose the maritime population is divided into five grand\r\ndivisions, the centres of which are the five great Naval stations, with\r\n12 subdivisions, including all the great seaports. Within these\r\ndivisions all men and youths from the 18th to 50th year of age, devoted\r\nto a sea-going life, are enrolled, to the number of about 170,000.\r\nExcept in a national emergency the government dispenses with the\r\nservices of all under 20, and over 40, as well as pilots, captains,\r\nfathers of large families, and seamen ready for long voyages in merchant\r\nships.\r\n\r\nThe navy was officered in 1869 by two admirals, 16 vice admirals in\r\nactive service, and 10 on the reserve list; 30 rear admirals in active,\r\nand 19 on reserve list; 130 captains of first class; 286 captains of\r\nfrigates; 825 lieutenants; 600 ensigns; and 300 midshipmen, or\r\naspirants;--total, 2,218 officers, and 39,346 sailors, who, together\r\nwith engineers, dockyard laborers, surgeons, chaplains, brought up the\r\nnumber in actual service in 1869 to 74,403, which did not include 28,623\r\nmarines.\r\n\r\nThe commercial marine of France embraced in 1867, 15,259 vessels, with a\r\ntonnage of 1,042,811, ranging from 30 tons to 800 tons each, and\r\nemploying over 150,000 seamen, including 40,000 officers, whose duties\r\nrequired special professional training. Of these, 607 were steamers,\r\nwith an aggregate of 129,777 tons and 55,160 horse power. The value of\r\nthe commerce of France for 1867-8 was 7,500 millions of francs.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. NAVAL AND NAVIGATION SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThe French government was among the earliest to provide special schools\r\nfor the officers of its merchant service as well as for its war-vessels.\r\nPrior even to the establishment, under an ordinance issued by Cardinal\r\nRichelieu, of schools for the study of navigation in 1629, Henry III.,\r\nin 1584, had instituted examinations for boatswains and captains of\r\nmerchant vessels, for which preparation had to be made with private\r\nteachers. In 1791 free schools of hydrography were authorized in\r\nthirty-four sea-ports; out of 24,000 pupils of these schools, from 1850\r\nto 1866, 3,731 qualified themselves as captains of vessels in the\r\nforeign trade, and 5,118 for service in the coasting trade. Prior to\r\n1800, in fitness of design and skill in construction, French naval\r\narchitecture was superior to that of other countries.\r\n\r\nThe system of education for the mercantile and military marine embraced\r\nin 1866 the following schools:\r\n\r\n   1. Nautical School for the Orphans of Sailors.\r\n   2. The Inflexible and other School-ships.\r\n   3. Naval Apprentice Schools at the government naval stations.\r\n   4. School for Boatswains and Shipmasters.\r\n   5. School for Naval Engineers and Stokers.\r\n   6. Naval Drawing School.\r\n   7. Schools of Navigation and Hydrography.\r\n   8. Naval School at Brest.\r\n   9. School of Naval Architecture at Paris\r\n  10. School of Marine Artillery.\r\n  11. School and Board of Hydrography.\r\n  12. Naval School of Medicine and Pharmacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVAL AND NAVIGATIONAL SCHOOLS IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the North German Confederation, and more recently of\r\nthe German Empire, and the necessities of its position, have already led\r\nto the rapid development of a military marine, and the unity of the\r\ncommercial interests of the different States will soon expand its\r\nnavigation as well as its naval armament.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. KINGDOM OF PRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nLong before Prussia was largely interested in either a military or\r\ncommercial marine, the government had provided for the systematic\r\ntraining of all concerned in the construction, equipment, and running of\r\nships, whether destined for the defense of the country or to its\r\ncommercial interests. After enjoying opportunities of studying the\r\ntheory of their business, as well as the practical application of its\r\nprinciples, they must pass an examination to test their knowledge both\r\nof the theory and practice--with a provision that no one shall assume\r\nthe responsibility of the life and property of others without holding a\r\ncertificate of proficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVIGATION SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nThere are six schools, situated at Memul, Dantzic, Pollan, Grabow (near\r\nStettin), and Stralsund, devoted to the education of young men who\r\npropose to become mariners and masters of merchant vessels. A single\r\ndirector, residing at Dantzic, has the superintendence of all these\r\nschools, which have each two professors, each in charge of a division of\r\nthe school, and an assistant who devotes himself to drawing in\r\nconnection with the construction of vessels, and of charts. The\r\nprincipal has charge of the higher division, in which navigation and\r\ngeography, both of the sea, and of the natural productions and\r\ncommercial facilities of different countries are taught. The lower\r\ndivision deals with subjects which concern pilots--their professional\r\nand legal duties.\r\n\r\nCandidates must have mastered the subjects of elementary instruction,\r\nand are examined as to their ability to read, write, and compose in\r\ntheir native language, and to go through ordinary arithmetical problems\r\nwith facility and accuracy. An examination of candidates takes place\r\nevery year at each school, which is conducted by the head professor, in\r\nthe presence of the director of this class of schools.\r\n\r\nTo be admitted to the examination the candidate must bring a certificate\r\nof good character, that he is over 14 and under 40 years of age. The\r\nschool fee is ten thalers per quarter for the highest or navigation\r\nclass, and six thalers for the lower or pilot’s class. There are 32\r\nlessons per week in both divisions.\r\n\r\nThe subjects taught in the lowest division are:--arithmetic, plane\r\ngeometry, carpentry, plane and spherical trigonometry, navigation,\r\nterritorial and astronomical observations, drawing of sea charts and\r\nastronomical maps, and the English language.\r\n\r\nIn the highest division, in addition to the studies of the lower, in\r\nwhich the pupils are carried further on, rigging and other points of\r\npractical seamanship, drawing the different parts of a vessel, the\r\ncommercial requirements respecting a ship’s papers, and the course of\r\nexchange at the principal commercial ports, are taught.\r\n\r\nA final examination is held in which diplomas are awarded to those who\r\nhave completed the whole course, and of proficiency in certain studies,\r\neither of which are of practical service in obtaining situations, and\r\nwithout which certain positions can not be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVAL ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\nIn the Trade or Polytechnic School in Berlin, provision is made for\r\ninstruction in naval construction:\r\n\r\n_First_--In the mathematical foundation of the most important physical\r\nlaws; in physics, drawing, modeling, and the general principles of\r\nconstruction; in practical hydraulics; the theory of machinery, and the\r\nsteam-engine.\r\n\r\n_Second_--In the application of these principles to the business of\r\nship-designing and construction, and particularly to designs for\r\nvessels, and the different parts of a ship in detail; to the art of\r\nship-building; the general displacement of water and stability;\r\nhydrostatic calculations; general principles with regard to the form of\r\nvessels, and the theory of sailing and steam-ships; details of\r\nconstruction of wooden and iron vessels; practice; and planning and\r\ncalculating the cost and capacity of vessels.\r\n\r\nThere are reviews of the ground gone over at the close of each term,\r\nwhich is obligatory only on those who enjoy free places, and each\r\nstudent receives a certificate at the end of his course, setting forth\r\nall his lectures and practical exercises, with an opinion as to his\r\npractical judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. AUSTRIA.\r\n\r\nUnder the new army organization of 1869, the military forces of the\r\nwhole empire are divided into the Standing Army, under the control of\r\nthe Imperial Minister of War; the Landwehr, whose duties are limited to\r\nthe respective divisions from which it is drawn, under the control of\r\nthe Austrian and Hungarian war ministers; and the Landstrum, or general\r\nlevy, which is compulsory in the Tyrol and Military Frontier, and\r\nvoluntary in the rest of the empire. The Emperor is supreme chief of the\r\nmilitary and naval forces, and from him must emanate all concentrating\r\nmovements of troops. In 1871 the Standing Army consisted of 278,470 men\r\non the peace footing, and 838,700 on the war footing.\r\n\r\nThe naval forces of Austria consisted in 1871, of 46 steamers and 10\r\nsailing vessels, viz.:\r\n\r\n                                   Horse-power.  Guns.  Tonnage.\r\n   2 Iron-clad Line-of-battle Ships,    1,800      22    11,138\r\n   7 Iron-clad Frigates,                4,550      88    25,452\r\n   4 Screw Frigates,                    1,500     149     9,407\r\n   3 Screw Corvettes,                     860      50     4,703\r\n   7 First class Gunboats,              1,610      30     4,311\r\n   3 Second class Gunboats,               270       9       999\r\n  16 Paddle Steamers,                   2,381      51     9,442\r\n  10 Sailing Ves’ls, viz.: 2 Frigates,   ....      35     3,032\r\n                           2 Corvettes,  ....      30     1,416\r\n                           4 Brigs,      ....      40     1,176\r\n                           2 Transp’ts,  ....       4       283\r\n\r\nThe navy is officered and manned by 2 vice-admirals, 4 rear-admirals, 24\r\ncaptains of steamers and frigates, 14 captains of corvettes, 106\r\nlieutenants, 343 ensigns and cadets, and 3,803 sailors, besides 875\r\nofficers and men in the marine corps. On the war footing the sailors\r\nnumber 3,743, and the marines 1,410. The men are recruited by\r\nconscription from the seafaring population, although the voluntary\r\nenlistments in the province of Dalmatia renders its enforcement\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe total commerce of Austria, comprising imports and exports, exceeded\r\n$400,000,000. The commercial marine includes 7,830 vessels, of 324,415\r\ntonnage, and 27,979 seamen. The Austrian Lloyd, a trading society\r\nestablished in Trieste in 1833, owns a fleet of 70 steamers, of 12,500\r\nhorse-power.\r\n\r\nTo provide officials, well instructed and trained in the administration\r\nof each department of the public service, military and civil--war by\r\nland and sea--both for military and commercial purposes, the government\r\nestablishes schools, with studies and practical exercises adapted to\r\neach branch.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS FOR THE MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL MARINE.\r\n\r\n1. _Military Marine._\r\n\r\nThere are in Austria several kinds of naval schools, as follows: One\r\neach for sailor boys, for marines, for quartermasters, for naval pupils\r\nof the first class, for naval pupils of the second class, a theoretical\r\nschool for naval cadets, and a superior establishment for naval\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n1. The school for sailor boys is intended to train, as petty officers\r\nfor the navy, young men from the Slave and German provinces, admitted\r\nbetween 12 and 14 years of age into the naval service. The instruction\r\nlasts until the pupil has attained the age for the conscription; he is\r\nthen entered as a sailor and becomes a petty officer as soon as he gets\r\nsufficiently used to the sea. The highest post he can attain is that of\r\nupper boatswain (_Hochbootsmann_.)\r\n\r\n2. The schools for marines (_Zeugscorps_) receive men drawn from\r\ndifferent corps of the army. They are trained as petty officers, and a\r\npart receive the uniform. Those who are fit to become officers receive\r\ntheir promotion when they leave their corps to enter the school.\r\n\r\n3. The school for naval cadets of the first class is kept on board a war\r\nvessel selected for the purpose. The object is to prepare for the naval\r\nservice youths of 16 or 18 years of age, who, on entering the school\r\nhave already received a complete civil technical education. The teaching\r\nhere consists, therefore, chiefly of practical seamanship, and also of\r\nthe application of previously acquired scientific knowledge to\r\nnavigation and nautical astronomy. The course occupies a year; on\r\nleaving, the pupil is received as a naval cadet. After passing two or\r\nthree years at sea these cadets enter the theoretical school for naval\r\ncadets.\r\n\r\n4. The school for naval cadets of the second class is intended solely to\r\nprepare them to become officers. In this school, beside the pupils\r\nplaced there at the cost of the State, there are others maintained by\r\nendowments, and also others who pay for their instruction. The sons of\r\nofficers and State functionaries are entitled to enter this school at\r\nthe public expense, and any Austrian subject who has the necessary\r\nqualifications is admitted on payment. Foreigners are also admissible as\r\npaying pupils, provided they can obtain authorization from their own\r\ngovernment to enter the Austrian service. To be admitted, candidates\r\nmust be between 12 and 14 years of age, of sound health without bodily\r\ndefect, and able to pass a previous examination. The instruction is\r\ngiven in accordance with a determined plan, on board a vessel prepared\r\nexpressly to receive the pupils. After three years’ instruction the\r\npupils leave the school as naval cadets and are sent to sea. At the end\r\nof two or three years’ active service the cadets are admitted to the\r\ntheoretical school. This school receives from 40 to 50 pupils. The\r\nchaplain on board is charged with the religious instruction; the other\r\nteaching is given by professors from the hydrographic schools. The naval\r\nofficers of the school-ship give the instruction in practical\r\nseamanship.\r\n\r\n5. The theoretical school for naval cadets is on shore, and its course\r\noccupies a year, after which the pupil undergoes the examination\r\nprescribed for his commission as an officer. On leaving this theoretical\r\nschool the pupils are still naval cadets, but become officers when\r\nappointed to a ship.\r\n\r\n6. The superior school for naval officers is intended for the further\r\nimprovement in mathematical and hydrographic studies, of such young men\r\nas have shown decided talent and taste for those sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.

The Naval School at Kiel is still recognized. Aspirants\r\nenter as naval cadets after passing an examination equivalent to the\r\nrequirements of a gymnasial maturity certificate, which in general\r\neducation is superior to the requirements of graduation of either our\r\nNaval or Military Academy. Before entering on their professional\r\nstudies, the cadet is first sent on a cruise to test his aptitude for\r\nsea-service. He then studies eight months at school and one year at sea,\r\nto pass as midshipman; and one year more at school, and three years at\r\nsea, to become sub-lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINE ACADEMY AT KIEL.\r\n\r\nThe German Marine Academy established in 1872, at Kiel, is designed not\r\nfor the education of cadets, but for the professional training and\r\nimprovement of officers already in the naval service of the empire--and\r\nis of the same character as the Staff School of Berlin for officers of\r\nthe army. Those only will be received as pupils, whose conduct and\r\ntalents seem to qualify them for superior scientific attainments, and,\r\nhereafter, for the filling of the most important posts. These\r\nofficer-pupils will be required to give proofs of their diligence and\r\nprogress by the production, from time to time, of theses and\r\ndissertations on scientific subjects given to them by the professors. At\r\nthe same time, all naval officers will be permitted to attend the\r\ncourses of instruction when their professional duties do not call them\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe course of study is to occupy two terms, each of twelve months’\r\nduration, with a vacation of three months for practical exercises.\r\n\r\nThe subjects for the first term are:--Mathematics, natural philosophy,\r\nchemistry, the theory of naval war in all its branches, military tactics\r\nin as far as disembarkations are concerned, coast surveying, the theory\r\nof the formation of coasts, coastal defenses, field fortification, the\r\nconstitution of military courts, the principles of international,\r\nmilitary, and naval law, the system of administration, sanitary science,\r\nespecially with reference to life aboard ship and in different climates,\r\nthe elements of logic, ethics, &c.\r\n\r\nThe following subjects will be included in the second term:--Nautical\r\nastronomy, geodesy, theory of maps and charts, the history of war, with\r\nespecial reference to naval war, artillery, ship-building, the\r\nconstruction of steam-engines (with practical exercises), the position\r\nand construction of naval ports, physical geography, the elements of\r\ngeology, marine botany and zoölogy, and the general history of modern\r\nliterature and civilization, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Errata for Part VIII (England and Naval Schools):\r\n  Oxford Blues, the Royal Scots, and the Second Queen’s Royals.[1]\r\n    Royals.”[1]\r\n  [Footnote 1]\r\n  The latter is the only body that has the privilege\r\n    _hyphen in “priv-/ilege” invisible at_\r\n  “to place themselves under the orders of a director of studies\r\n    _mismatched open quote in original_\r\n  feel the effects of the change which has been made in it.”\r\n    _closing ” missing_\r\n  practical trial in their work. ... appointments and promotion.\r\n    _both . missing_\r\n  will be regulated at the following rates, as heretofore:\r\n    followig\r\n  elsewhere than at Eton\r\n    Eaton\r\n  The use of meteorological instruments\r\n    intruments\r\n  and to lay them underground,\r\n    undergound\r\n  Facing B.L. guns. / Practical examination, etc.\r\n    etc,\r\n  the Royal Warrant for Pay, Promotion,” etc.,\r\n    _printed as shown: missing open quote or superfluous close quote?_\r\n  [Footnote 5]\r\n  and an examination of persons to act as pilots and mariners.\r\n    _final . missing_\r\n  [Footnote 6]\r\n  Hollanders, 1,(3);\r\n    _printed as shown_\r\n  and give a great deal of trouble; we want men.”\r\n    _close quote missing_\r\n  a physical and military education, which developes their strength\r\n    _anomalous spelling unchanged_\r\n  averages a little more than £6 per boy per annum.\r\n    _final . missing_\r\n  But such was not the case.\r\n    csse\r\n  and the studies were pursued with greater vigor.\r\n    persued\r\n  [The following table, giving the statistics of the school at Toulon]\r\n    |251|235|181|97|67|58|\r\n    _last row of table has 225 for 235_\r\n  The requirements for admission are a knowledge of arithmetic,\r\n    knowlege]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  PART IX.\r\n\r\n  MILITARY SYSTEM AND SCHOOLS IN SWITZERLAND.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY SYSTEM AND MILITARY INSTRUCTION IN SWITZERLAND.\r\n\r\n  [Extract from “A Plan for Military Education in Massachusetts.” By E.\r\nDwight.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. OUTLINE OF MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1847 seven of the cantons of the Swiss Republic seceded from\r\nthe Confederacy. Among them were the three forest cantons, the original\r\nnucleus around which the whole Republic had been formed, the birth-place\r\nof William Tell and Arnold, of Winkelreid. The seceders held the\r\nstrongest military position in Europe, but the loyal cantons put on foot\r\nan army of 100,000 men, well armed, drilled, and officered. The city of\r\nFriburg was taken, and in thirty days from the first proclamation of the\r\ncommanding general the war was ended and order was restored.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, a quarrel having arisen with the king of Prussia, Switzerland\r\nplaced on foot an army of 200,000 men well provided with artillery. Thus\r\nthe military system of Switzerland has proved itself effective; and as\r\nthere is no standing army whatever, and the state is a confederacy of\r\ncantons under democratic forms of government, we may find something in\r\ntheir system applicable to our own case.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland covers an area of about 15,000 square miles, equal to that\r\nof Vermont and New Hampshire together, of which a large portion is\r\ncovered by lakes, forests, mountains, ice and snow, leaving only\r\nthirty-one per cent of the land fit for agricultural purposes, not\r\nincluding the mountain pastures. Possessing a population of only two\r\nmillions and a half of people, it is surrounded by military powers of\r\nthe first class, and must needs be strong to be free. France, Austria,\r\nand Prussia are not always as good friends as they are near neighbors,\r\nand the little Republic must ever be ready to ward a blow and return it.\r\nThe constitution of Switzerland declares that every citizen is a\r\nsoldier. “Tout Suisse est soldat.” Military service is required between\r\nthe ages of twenty and forty-four. The substitution of one man for\r\nanother is forbidden, but exemption from service is allowed to certain\r\npersons, such as officers of the government and of public institutions,\r\nclergymen, students of theology, members of the police, pilots and\r\nothers. In some cases a man is excused from the more active service, but\r\nrequired to pass through the regular course of military instruction and\r\nto serve in the reserve of the army when called upon. Such are the only\r\nson, or one of the sons, of a widow; or of a widower, provided the\r\nfather be over sixty years old, and the son necessary to his support; a\r\nwidower, the father of children in their minority, who has no resources\r\nexcept the work of his own hands; one of two or more sons when they make\r\ncommon household with their parents, if the family could not be\r\nsupported by other brothers not subject to service; married men, or\r\nwidowers having at least two children. These exceptions do not apply to\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe Council of State of each canton appoints yearly a “Commission on\r\nFurlough and Discharge,” consisting of ten members, of whom two are\r\nmedical men, two officers, one a corporal, one a soldier, and the others\r\nmembers of the council. The commission acts under oath; grants exemption\r\nfor physical defects or want of height; or passes men from the active\r\nservice to the reserve. A man who at the age of twenty has not attained\r\nthe height of five feet and one inch can be furloughed for two years;\r\nand if, at the end of the third year, he has not reached this height,\r\ndischarged from all service. Men who have been convicted of disgraceful\r\ncrimes, or have suffered penal sentence, are declared unworthy of\r\nbearing arms; and if once deprived of their civil rights can not hold a\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nThe militia is divided into the federal contingent and the landwehr. The\r\nfederal contingent consists--_First_, of the elite, which includes three\r\nper cent of the whole population, taken from those between the ages of\r\ntwenty and thirty-four. The time of service in the elite is eight years.\r\n_Second_, the reserve, being one and a half per cent of the population\r\nand not above the age of forty. The landwehr includes men up to the age\r\nof forty-four. The landsturm, or _levy en masse_, consists of the whole\r\nmale population, capable of bearing arms, between the ages of twenty and\r\nfifty, and not included in the classes before described. The male\r\npopulation of Switzerland is 1,140,000, of which thirty-seven per cent,\r\nor 422,000, are between twenty and forty-four years of age. One-fourth\r\nof these are exempt or found unfit for service, leaving 316,000\r\nperfectly fit. In 1853 the number of men required for the federal\r\ncontingent was 104,354,[1] but according to official statements the\r\nnumber of men in all branches of the service, well armed and instructed,\r\namounted to 125,126. The excess of men supplied, over those required,\r\narose from the public spirit and general desire for military instruction\r\nexisting among the people. Add to these 125,000 the landwehr, which\r\nnumbered 150,000, and we have a total of 275,000 effective men, well\r\narmed, drilled, and officered.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Infantry, including Rifles, 89,366; Artillery,\r\n    10,366; Cavalry, 2,869; Engineers, 1,530.]\r\n\r\nThe federal army is composed of the following arms: engineers, including\r\nsappers and pontoniers; artillery, including rocket batteries; cavalry,\r\nriflemen, light infantry, and infantry. There is besides a medical corps\r\nfor the service of the ambulances and hospitals. But as uninstructed men\r\nare of little or no value, the federal law upon military organization\r\nprovides that the cantons shall see to it that the infantry of their\r\ncontingent is completely instructed according to the federal rules, and\r\nthough the application of this principle in its details is left to each\r\ncanton, yet the following rules are laid down: recruits are not received\r\ninto the federal elite until they have gone through a complete course of\r\ninstruction which lasts at least twenty-eight days for infantry, and\r\nthirty-five days for light infantry. The confederation charges itself\r\nwith the instruction of the engineers, artillery, cavalry, and riflemen.\r\nThis course lasts twenty-eight days for riflemen and forty-two days for\r\nthe three other arms, but these recruits have previously been drilled in\r\nthe school of the soldier by their cantons, and the riflemen have\r\nreceived preparatory instruction in firing at a mark.\r\n\r\nIn the larger cantons--that of Zurich for instance--divisions of\r\nrecruits in succession are put into barracks and well drilled\r\npractically and theoretically for fifty-six days, either consecutively\r\nor at two periods of the same year, as may best suit the youths. In the\r\nsecond year after entering the elite, and for each year afterwards, the\r\ninfantry is called out for drill during three days, by half battalions\r\nat least, with preparatory drill of three days for the “cadres,”[2] the\r\ncommissioned and non-commissioned officers forming skeleton corps. Days\r\nof entry into service are not counted as days of drill, and in case of\r\ninterruption the days of drill are increased by two days. The reserve is\r\ncalled out for drill during two days of each year, with a preparatory\r\ndrill of one day for the “cadres.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: The officers, non-commissioned officers, and\r\n    corporals, constitute what is called the “cadre.”]\r\n\r\nIn the corps of engineers, artillery, cavalry, and riflemen, the elite\r\nis called out every alternate year for the engineers and artillery, and\r\nevery year for the cavalry and rifles. The drill lasts four days for the\r\n“cadre” of engineers and artillery, and immediately after ten days for\r\nthe cadres and companies united, or twelve days for both together. For\r\nthe cavalry the drill lasts seven days for dragoons and four days for\r\n“guides;” for riflemen, two days for the cadres, and immediately\r\nafterwards four days for cadres and companies united. The reserve is\r\ncalled out for a drill of half the length of that of the elite.\r\n\r\nTo complete the instruction of the soldier the cantons in their turn\r\nsend their men yearly to the federal camps where the troops to the\r\nnumber of three or four thousand, are kept under canvas for two weeks.\r\nLarger numbers of men, forming bodies of 5,000 and upwards, are also\r\nmustered and cantoned in the villages, and during several days exercised\r\nin the grand movements and manœuvres of war, chiefly for the instruction\r\nof commanders and officers of the staff.\r\n\r\nTo keep up the efficiency of every department of the service the whole\r\nis subjected to the yearly inspection of colonels of the federal staff\r\nappointed by the central government. The inspection of infantry is\r\nconfided to ten colonels who serve for three years. There is also an\r\ninspector in each of the arms of engineers and artillery, the latter\r\nhaving under his direction an administrator of materiel charged with the\r\ninspection and surveillance of all the materiel of the confederation.\r\nThis administrator directs and superintends the workmen employed in the\r\nfactories of the confederation for the manufacture of powder and\r\npercussion caps, as well as arms, gun-carriages, &c. The colonel of\r\ncavalry and the colonel of rifles direct all that relates to their\r\nrespective arms, and recommend the necessary improvements. If these\r\ninspectors detect in the contingent of any canton any want of perfection\r\nin drill, they have the power to order such additional drill as may\r\nbring the men up to the proper standard.\r\n\r\nGreat care is taken in the instruction and selection of officers. The\r\nofficers of infantry, up to the grade of major, are appointed by the\r\ncantonal authorities; the higher officers by the federal government. But\r\nno officers can be appointed to the special arms of engineers,\r\nartillery, and cavalry, except such as have gone through a course of\r\ninstruction at a military school appropriate to each arm. No one can\r\nbecome a non-commissioned officer who has not served at least one year\r\nas a soldier, nor a commissioned officer except after two years’\r\nservice. Candidates for promotion must pass a public examination, before\r\na commission, both in theoretical and practical knowledge. Promotion is\r\ngiven, according to seniority, up to the grade of first lieutenant.\r\nCaptains are chosen from among the lieutenants without regard to\r\nseniority. To be appointed major, eight years’ service as an officer is\r\nrequired, of which, at least, two years as captain. For a\r\nlieutenant-colonel, ten years’ service as officer, of which, at least,\r\nfour as major of the special arm. For a colonel, twelve years’ service\r\nas an officer is required, of which, at least, four years as\r\n“commandant,” or in a higher grade. In the Swiss service there is no\r\nhigher rank than that of colonel. When a colonel has been appointed\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army, he receives for the time being, the\r\ntitle of general, which he afterwards retains by courtesy.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Professor L. Simonson, of Trinity College, Hartford,\r\nConn., for the following communication respecting the cadet system in\r\nschools not specially military and the practice of target shooting in\r\nSwitzerland, by which a military spirit is fostered throughout the\r\nentire population and the highest skill in the use of the rifle is\r\nattained by a large number of individuals, who are thus prepared for any\r\nsudden call to arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE CADET SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss boy learns target shooting and practices gymnastic and\r\nmilitary exercises at a very early age. He imbibes with his mother’s\r\nmilk the thought that his first duty is to become a defender of his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThese boy-soldiers are styled _Cadets_, and are a fruit that can spring\r\nup and ripen on democratic soil only. The first armed corps of the kind\r\nwe find in Berne near the end of the 16th century. But the general\r\npractice of military exercises among them dates back only about eighty\r\nyears, when the HELVETIC MILITARY ASSOCIATION began to advocate the\r\nformation of _Corps de Cadets_ in all parts of Switzerland. From that\r\ntime the most efficient and eminent officers devoted themselves\r\nenthusiastically to this cause. The first corps sprang up in Aarau,\r\nSursen and Olten. Aarau possessed for a long time the best drilled,\r\nlargest and finest corps, and in the canton of Argovia generally the\r\nsystem has struck deeper root than elsewhere; but well drilled corps can\r\nbe found in any of the larger places, as in Zofingen, Lenzburg, Brugg,\r\nBaden, and a dozen other places. It was an old custom for the cadets to\r\nparade in the federal cities--Zurich, Berne and Lucerne--in honor of the\r\nassembling of the Swiss Diet, (Tagsatzung.) As far back as 1770 we find\r\na boy-corps of infantry and artillery in Zurich, yet towards the end of\r\nthe last century the organization was partially broken up, until the\r\npolitical renovation of the canton in 1830 re-organized the corps anew.\r\nBesides in the capital, we find corps in Winterthur, Uster, Wald, Stäfa,\r\nMeilen, Horgen, Wädenswyl, and other towns on the lake shores. Berne,\r\nBiel, Thun, Burgdorf, and many other Bernese villages, for thirty or\r\nforty years have practiced their school-boys in the exercise of arms.\r\nThe state takes special care to give the students of the University of\r\nBerne and of the two normal schools a thorough military training. The\r\ncantons of Lucerne, Solothurn, Basle, Schaffhausen, St. Gall, Appenzell,\r\nGlarus, Tessin, Friburg, Neufchâtel, and the countries of Vand and of\r\nthe Grisons, possess each of them one or more cadet-corps. Military\r\ndrill, as well as gymnastic exercises, forms part of the regular school\r\nroutine of all middle and higher schools of the above-named cantons.\r\nProvision is now made to extend this discipline over all schools, making\r\nit obligatory on every pupil who is not disabled by bodily defects.\r\nMilitary practice commences at the age of eleven and is continued to the\r\nage of eighteen or nineteen. Federal or cantonal officers and\r\ninstructors drill the youth two afternoons in the week, the more\r\nadvanced only once a week. The youth thus disciplined, learn not only to\r\nobey but also to command. The officers of every corps are promoted from\r\nthe rank and file, and in this manner are excellently fitted to become\r\nafterwards officers in the federal army. All cadets when they are\r\nenrolled at a later period into the militia, are by law exempted from\r\ndrill. The arms are furnished by the state or community; the uniform,\r\nwhich the pupil may wear in or out of service, must be procured by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nMost of the cadet-corps consist of infantry, (sharp-shooters and\r\nmusketeers;) many have, however, artillery also, as in Zurich, their\r\nguns throwing balls of two and four pounds weight. In Argovia and some\r\nother cantons there are even grenadiers and sappers. Cavalry exist in\r\ntheory only. A gun with bayonet and cartridge-box, here and there also a\r\nknapsack and sword form the equipment of the foot-soldier. The uniforms\r\nare various and fanciful. The Zurich Cadets distinguish themselves by\r\ntheir simple and tasteful appearance; they wear a dark blue coat with\r\nwhite metal buttons, grey pants, and dark blue cap with the cockade.\r\nEvery corps has one or more smaller or larger flags. Many cantons have\r\nexcellent bands of music; others, as Zurich, have only drummers and\r\ntheir indispensable drum-major, and sing martial songs while marching.\r\n\r\nIt is a universal custom to close the school year in autumn by a\r\nfestival, the shining point of which is the military parade and field\r\nmanœuvre. The Swiss juvenile festivals have gained quite a reputation at\r\nhome and abroad. In the Argovian communities all the school children,\r\nthe females as well as males, festively adorned, participate. The corps\r\nof the whole canton and even of several cantons are often united in the\r\nfield manœuvre; on such an occasion the enthusiasm and emulation of\r\nyouth reach the highest pitch. Thus the Bernese Cadet Corps in 1821 had\r\na common drill parade in the neighborhood of the capital, and many\r\nothers have since come off. In 1816 about 1,000 Argovians went into camp\r\nat Lenzburg, and all of them will joyfully remember this merry festival.\r\nA still greater notoriety was gained by the hot sham fights at\r\nWettingen, which came off in 1821, and in which the Argovian, Zurich and\r\nWinterthur cadets operated together. Two brigades consisting of 1,560\r\nmen, all told, with seven cannon fought there for the positions between\r\nWettingen and Baden; the most glorious affair of the day was the heroic\r\ndefense and final storming of the Wettingen bridge. Yet all other\r\nmanœuvres of that sort have been thrown into shadow by the great Swiss\r\ncadet feast in September, 1856. It will not be forgotten by the\r\nthousands, who participated either as actors or spectators, even if\r\nthere should be at some future day a re-union of all the corps of\r\nSwitzerland. Ten cantons participated in that festival. Argovia\r\nfurnished 974 men; Zurich, 805; St. Gall, 472; Schaffhausen, 186; the\r\nGrisons, 166; Ausserrhoden, 155; Lucerne, 148; Thurgovia, 111; Glarus,\r\n60; and Tessin even sent over the St. Gothard a contingent of\r\neighty-four. Thus 3,161 young heroes, in various but generally tasteful\r\nuniforms, with bands of music, one hundred and twenty-four drums,\r\nnumerous banners, and ten cannon, entered the festively-adorned Zurich\r\nfrom all sides. Divided into two little armies drawn up in battle array\r\nbetween Oerlicon and Schwamendingen, they fought over the celebrated\r\nbattle of June 4th, 1799, in which the French under Massena, were\r\ndefeated by the Austrians under Archduke Charles.\r\n\r\nThe youths in Zurich as well as in other cantons, have no reason to\r\ncomplain that their physical development is neglected in favor of the\r\nmental; nay, we might rather fear that the first is at times too much\r\nexaggerated, considering the tender age of the majority of the boys. The\r\npupils of the canton Gymnasium and Industrial School, many of whom are\r\nforeigners, Germans especially, practice gymnastic exercises throughout\r\nthe whole year; the military drill is limited to the summer course only.\r\nIn the month of August, from time immemorial, the boys, all and every\r\none, practice target-shooting. The smaller boys only are allowed to rest\r\nthe gun on the stand; the older must shoot without any support whatever.\r\nThe cities and individuals furnish prizes for those who hit the centre\r\nof the target. In September the cadets--the infantry as well as\r\nartillery--hold their target-shooting; in October they drill in the\r\nfield, (“Vorkämpfli,”) and then comes off the annual School Festival\r\nwith its gymnastic exercises and the combined manœuvre in field.\r\n\r\nAt the sham fight on the 1st of October, 1860, the enemy as usual\r\nexisted in fancy only; they fired, however, as if he were flesh and\r\nblood. They had the task of pursuing the imaginary foe from Windicon to\r\nthe Höckler. The division marched over the covered bridge at Aussersihl,\r\ndetached then a column to the woody heights in order to outflank the\r\nenemy, while the principal body marched along the Sihl and drove the\r\nenemy from the clearings into the thick woods. Both divisions re-united\r\nat the Höckler Bridge and marched to the great “Wollishofer Allmend,”\r\nwhere they practiced firing. This is a beautiful spot for the deployment\r\nof troops; the sound of every shot is returned in manifold echoes from\r\nthe surrounding heights. The Zurich and federal troops also encamp,\r\npractice, and shoot on this “Allmend.”\r\n\r\nThe annual festival of one canton school came off on the day for\r\ngymnastic and military exercises. The printed programme distributed\r\namong the pupils contains the order of exercises, the plan of the\r\nmanœuvre, and some useful hints in large type, as, “Clear the\r\nroad”--“Smoking is prohibited to the pupils during the festival”--“Not\r\ntoo fast”--“Do not forget the ramrod”--“Always 120 paces distance.” At 6\r\no’clock, A.M., the drummers beat the reveille, proceeding from the\r\nguard-house in three different directions. If the weather is\r\nunfavorable, the reveille is not beaten, the school begins at the usual\r\nhour, and the next fair day is chosen for the feast. The beaming sun\r\ndispersed, however, on this occasion, the autumnal morning mists, and\r\nuniversal joy beamed from all faces. On the first day the public\r\ngymnastic exercises came off, and after supper the decisions of the\r\numpires were proclaimed and prizes distributed.\r\n\r\nThe second day the whole corps, numbering about five hundred, hastens at\r\n7 o’clock, armed and equipped, to the barracks, and marches from there\r\nto the open space near the railroad station, where from 8 to 10, Colonel\r\nZiegler, the Secretary of War, accompanied by members of the Board of\r\nSupervisors, is occupied with the general inspection of “his young\r\ncomrades.” At 12½ the corps assembles again near the barracks, where\r\nthey receive their ammunition, and at 1 o’clock they turn out to the\r\nmanœuvre. The corps is divided into two small armies, each of which\r\nconsists of a centre, right and left wings, and a reserve. The enemy\r\nunder the command of Lieutenant-colonel Von Escher, marches over\r\nRiesbach and Zollicon into his position. The federal troops under\r\nCommandant Nadler, take their way over Hirslanden and the Balgrist. The\r\nleft wing of the enemy, meanwhile, had taken possession of the heights\r\nabove the Zollicon, and his main body is marching on the right bank of\r\nthe lake upon Zurich. The enemy makes a halt, and receives the report of\r\nhis scouts, that the “Burghölzli” and the heights of the Balgrist have\r\nbeen taken possession of by the federal army for the purpose of impeding\r\nthe further advance of the hostile troops over Hirslanden. The federals\r\nat 3 o’clock attack the enemy in his position on the mountain, but they\r\nare beaten back, notwithstanding their heroic endeavors, and are\r\ncompelled to retreat since the enemy changes his defensive position into\r\na general charge. The federals retire in good order, and the enemy\r\npurchases every inch of ground at a great sacrifice. Though he succeeds\r\nin cutting off a side column, his losses must be great until he can\r\nsilence the murderous fire of the federal battery which has taken a very\r\nfavorable position on the “Oberrieder Heights,” and after having done so\r\nhe advances to the lowlands.\r\n\r\nThe fight offers many a picturesque scene. Nowhere such a diversified,\r\nbroken battle-ground can be found as in the Swiss fore-lands. Especially\r\nin the neighborhood of Zurich one is at a loss which to choose. There\r\nare every where covers and ambuscades for riflemen; the infantry find\r\nnumerous advantageous positions, and many heights easily accessible\r\nwhich command vales and plains are at the command of the artillery. The\r\nleaders have hard work to restrain the ardor of the boy-soldiers,\r\nespecially of those in the broken chain of the sharp-shooters. Finally\r\nthe signal shot is fired, followed immediately by many others. It is a\r\nreal feast to observe how the skirmishers, while running from one cover\r\nto the other, crouch together as much as possible; how skillfully they\r\ntake advantage of every little mound, and how they endeavor in their\r\nattack to avail themselves of every protection. This or that one seems a\r\nperfect little Zouave; some even show the disposition of a Turcos. One\r\nloads his rifle lying flat on his back, another springs forward like a\r\ntiger. To be commanded to the chain of the skirmishers is considered\r\nspecial good fortune, for there the individual is something by himself,\r\ncan move at will, and is supplied with plenty of ammunition. Yet, the\r\nmain body also of the army, which is obliged to fight in closed lines\r\nand strict order, is allowed to vent its fury in firing by single files\r\nand by battalions in thundering vollies. At the command to fire a\r\nhundred muskets at once, but a single peal as of thunder is heard, and\r\nthe smoke of the powder fills the air with the sweetest of savors. For a\r\nchange we turn to the artillery. Though they do not possess any rifled\r\ncannon, they are nevertheless intent upon aiming their guns accurately,\r\nand the little self-possessed gunners who serve the pieces would prove\r\ndangerous adversaries to any foe. They mount and dismount a piece as\r\nquickly as any trained artillery-man, and where the ground offers great\r\nimpediments, one can see the stronger boys carrying their own pieces.\r\n\r\nThe “Father of the Cadets,” Colonel Ziegler, is present at the sham\r\nfights as an impartial umpire, walking continually on the battle-field,\r\nand smiling as one or the other section makes a good hit. As soon as the\r\nretreating federal troops have gained a favorable position, they stop\r\nshort, concentrate their forces, and brave any further advance of the\r\nenemy who, after he has made some further unsuccessful attempts, is\r\nconvinced that the federals are a match for him, and even stronger than\r\nhimself, makes a halt, and the battle ends. The white cross in the red\r\nfield (the federal banner) remains, of course always master of the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nMany a manœuvre has ended without any accident, yet sometimes a\r\nhot-blooded cadet forgets the ramrod, and wounds a soldier from the\r\nhostile lines or a spectator, for the people mingle without fear among\r\nthe combatants. Every Swiss is a soldier, and the crack of the guns is a\r\ncongenial sound to him. The European diplomatists who met in Zurich in\r\nthe Fall of 1860 for the settlement of the peace of Villafranca, were\r\nall present at the manœuvres, and undoubtedly depicted the cadet system\r\nto their respective governments in glowing colors, recommending the\r\ngeneral adoption of the system. We now ask our governors and our people\r\nin general--“Shall we be the last?” A noble ardor may accomplish a good\r\ndeal, yet _strength_ combined with will can accomplish far more--almost\r\nevery thing.\r\n\r\nAfter the parties have fought an hour and a half in the sight of the\r\nAlps and the glittering lake, and rested a little while, they march in\r\nbrotherly union with glowing faces, to the sound of the drum, or singing\r\npatriotic songs, from the heights down to the shore road, enter\r\nTiefbrunnen, and stack their arms in pyramids on the green sward of its\r\nhospitable pleasure-grounds. Then after the labor and heat of the day,\r\nthe young soldiers hasten at double-quick step, and with Goliath-like\r\nappetite, to the garden of the neighboring inn, which stands on the\r\nshore of the beautiful lake, and give fearful battle to a second enemy\r\nin the form of loaves, sausages, etc.; the blood of the grape runs like\r\nwater, and so indefatigable are they in continually repeated onslaughts,\r\nthat in a short time the forces of the enemy have wholly disappeared.\r\nThe state bears the expenses, in order that the poorest boy may be that\r\nday as rich as his upper-ten comrade. Shouts and hurras spice the good\r\nthings still more. Meanwhile it has grown dark, the cadets take to their\r\narms again, and by the light of numerous torches, Colonel Ziegler\r\nproclaims and distributes the prizes. The name of every victor is\r\nreceived with the beat of the drum and thousands of hurras. The results\r\nof the target shooting in 1860 were not so satisfactory as in former\r\nyears. The artillery gained 65 prizes in one hundred shots, the foot 28;\r\nwhile in 1859 the former received 86, and the latter 33, in the average\r\nof all distances. The first two prizes were again taken by Glarus boys.\r\nThis little people, renowned through its marksmen, has for the last\r\nseven years monopolized the first prizes.\r\n\r\nFinally the warlike band marches home and the officers and instructors\r\nmeet again at a social supper, which lasts until after midnight. Thus\r\nends the manœuvre of Swiss boys.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss militia system may be our model. It will insure our internal\r\npeace and national independence. It will unite the citizens of all\r\nstates into one band of brothers. Every people rears troublesome\r\nindividuals. Switzerland had to contend with internal difficulties,\r\nfactions, etc., as we have now, but the majesty of the law was upheld by\r\nthe masses, and while the rebels were beaten in the field, the people of\r\nthe different sections met again in friendship. And so, we trust, it\r\nwill be with us. The day may not be distant when we shall want the\r\nstrength of our whole beloved Union to maintain our position among the\r\ngreat nations of the earth. United we need not fear the world in arms.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss are the most peaceable and industrious people, and at the same\r\ntime the most warlike and ever-ready. In the idea of the Swiss, the\r\ncitizen is inseparable from the soldier, lest the free man should become\r\nthe slave of a domestic or foreign tyrant. The first advantage of this\r\nidea is, that Switzerland has not a standing army, and yet it can call\r\ninto the field at any moment 200,000 well trained men in the flower of\r\ntheir age; a like number could be raised of younger men under twenty-one\r\nand above forty-five. 200,000 men is eight per cent of its population,\r\naccording to which we could have about 2,200,000 citizen soldiers, not\r\non paper only, but real soldiers. If we institute the cadet system the\r\nnext generation will be a warlike one, and no American will even think\r\nof making a law, exempting the citizen from his first duty to appear in\r\nperson for the defense of his liberties and independence. The whole\r\namount of the Swiss military _Budget_[3] is between four and five\r\nmillions of francs, equal to ten millions of dollars for our 2,200,000\r\nmen--a trifle indeed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Federal and cantonal.]\r\n\r\nFrom time to time the governors of neighboring states could unite the\r\ncadet-corps of different sections and invite the corps from distant\r\nstates to send a contingent for a grand manœuvre. Such a proceeding\r\nwould tend more to cement the band of brotherhood among the states than\r\nmany artificial means. It would at the same time promote the good morals\r\nof the boys, if the governors were to select the best delegates from\r\ntheir states. Every obdurate, mischievous individual should be expelled\r\nfrom the ranks, since the state must not suffer a bad subject to enjoy\r\nthe honor of serving his country. What a wonderful change will take\r\nplace in the disposition of our youth; when accustomed to the discipline\r\nof a soldier, many a bad habit will disappear entirely. They will become\r\npunctual and orderly in the execution of their duties in general, their\r\nstep elastic, their carriage erect, their bodies strong, their chests\r\nlarge, their cheeks rosy, a joy to their parents and a pride to our\r\npeople. The lad who leaves his city or his state, if furnished with a\r\nregular certificate from his drill-master, can enter a company in the\r\nplace of his future residence, and be no longer a stranger but a\r\nbrother-soldier--the member of a mighty association. He enters the\r\ncircle of well educated boys at once, and is thus saved from the danger\r\nof associating with such as might corrupt his good habits. There are\r\nthousands of advantages to him and the country, and not a single\r\ndisadvantage. Why shall we not seize upon the subject at once? Let our\r\nsmall state have the honor to be the first, as we already have the best\r\nregulated system of schools--primary, secondary, and higher\r\ninstitutions. Forward! forward!\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent article we shall give a description of a “Swiss Shooting\r\nFestival.” It is an ancient custom with the Alpine people, but since the\r\nsystem of cadet corps has become perfected, these festivals have come\r\noff with a splendor that had never before been dreamed of. They unite\r\nthe men of all sections and have gained quite a fame in Europe.\r\n\r\nWe implore all statesmen and teachers to take the system of military\r\ndrill and organization in schools into due consideration; not as a mere\r\nexperiment, but as something that has proved an excellent success in a\r\nsister republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. TARGET SHOOTING.\r\n\r\nHaving made military exercises a part of the regular routine of schools\r\nand the education of youths, and identified the vocation of the soldier\r\nwith the privileges of citizenship and the safety of the state, the\r\npolicy of the Swiss government, both cantonal and federal, has been\r\ndirected so as to make the pastimes of neighborhoods and the national\r\nfestivals minister to the general culture of a military spirit, and of\r\nthe highest individual skill in the use of arms. To these ends target\r\nshooting is encouraged in various ways, and the festivals of the\r\nsharp-shooters are more generally and enthusiastically attended than any\r\nother national anniversary. We give below an account of a festival of\r\nthis kind, which was held in Zurich in July, 1859.\r\n\r\n_A Festival of the Swiss Sharp-shooters._\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman has his rose festivals; the Italian his barcaroli; the\r\nSpaniard his bull-fights; the Englishman, since his cock-fights and\r\nboxing in the street are prohibited, has nothing left to him, for\r\nhorse-racing as well as the Parliament belongs to the aristocracy\r\nonly.[4] Germany has its popular festivals, though the potentates have\r\nsuppressed even these harmless popular gatherings in several parts of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: The rifle shooting, cricket matches, and other\r\n    popular sports of England seems to be overlooked by Professor\r\n    Simonson.]\r\n\r\nIn southern Germany and in the north-west you may still find the\r\nold-fashioned popular festivals. But Switzerland is their field; there\r\nin the land of freedom they flourish in the utmost freshness. They\r\narouse and foster in the people the consciousness that they are a\r\npeople--a nation; they awaken and strengthen the national spirit; they\r\nunite all citizens, whether they sit as legislators in the Diet, or till\r\nthe ground in some unknown corner of the republic.\r\n\r\nThe festival begins at 6 o’clock, A.M., with the firing of cannon--one\r\nshot for each of the twenty-two cantons into which Switzerland is\r\ndivided. The sharp-shooter festivals are the oldest of the Swiss popular\r\nfestivals--the original fruits of a free warlike people. They are\r\ncustomary in every canton, in every community. But the _Swiss_\r\nsharp-shooter festival means that in which the whole country unites, and\r\nit has existed now for many, many years, always fresher and more\r\nbeautiful, representing not only the united citizens of the Swiss\r\ncantons, but of Switzerland as a political power.\r\n\r\nSuch a festival takes place every second year. Then, thirty thousand\r\nfree, warlike men, the best marksmen from all parts of the land, the\r\n“élite” of Switzerland’s defenders, assemble with their rifles, which\r\nthey handle with more skill than any other nation. They represent in\r\nfact the best men of their nation, the bodyguard of law and order, the\r\nrampart against hostile aggressions, and the stay of popular commotions.\r\nIn such a noble assembly many a wise word is spoken, many an idea\r\nexchanged and corrected. The actions of the administration are subjected\r\nto a sharp but judicious and just criticism; you will not hear there\r\nostentatious speeches, nor see noisy demonstrations. They do not pass\r\nresolutions such as we are wont to see in our country--a small clique of\r\npetty politicians announcing to the people that: _The People of the\r\nState, . . . . resolved, etc._; but calmly they reason and reflect on\r\nwhat would be beneficial to all sections of the country, and after\r\nhaving reconciled the opposing interests of all, they go home and work\r\neach in his circle for the realization of their ideas. There is a\r\nprinciple--not of blind opposition to actions, whether good or bad,\r\nsimply because they proceed from another party--but the principle of\r\ndoing justice to all, of upholding the rights of all, and of reconciling\r\nopposing interests. A people that has been educated in such principles\r\nand acts in accordance with them has reached the perfection of\r\nrepublicanism, and need not fear either internal or external foes. Every\r\nAmerican patriot may take example from this little Alpine race; and\r\nsince every one, man or woman, is by nature an educator, whether as\r\ndirector of a household, or as a teacher of other men’s children, let us\r\nall unite in educating the growing generation in the right way, and our\r\nbeloved country shall never again see brothers in arms against brothers.\r\n\r\nMany a corrupt official has feared the criticism of the assembly of the\r\nSwiss sharp-shooters, and whatever “the men have resolved at the\r\nfestival,” is usually adopted by the people and carried through in a\r\njudicious, constitutional way.\r\n\r\nAt the above-mentioned day Zurich was all in a glee; the city adorned\r\nwith flags, triumphal arches and evergreens, the streets thronging with\r\npeople in Sunday dress who had come from far and wide to participate in\r\nthe popular feast. The shrill sound of an engine is heard, and soon\r\nafter the first company of guests from abroad forms in line at the\r\nrailroad station. It is the delegation from the Bremen sharp-shooters,\r\nwho have come from the far north of Germany to meet their brethren of\r\nthe south. They are enthusiastically received by the crowd, the mayor\r\naddresses them and gives them a cordial welcome to the land of freedom.\r\nAfter one of their number has replied to the speech, the mayor leads the\r\nguests to a tent and invites them to partake of some refreshments; the\r\nbest of native wines from the “Rathskeller” are offered, and many a\r\ntoast spices the nectar.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the flag of the Swiss sharp-shooters is received and\r\nunfolded, while shouts and the roar of cannon rend the air. As we stated\r\nbefore, the festival of the United Sharp-shooters comes off once in two\r\nyears, city and canton taking their turns. Two years before, in July,\r\n1857, it had been celebrated in Berne, and the flag had remained there\r\nuntil now, when a deputation from Berne delivers it to the\r\nsharp-shooters of Zurich, to be kept by them for the next two years; and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the banner is unfurled the procession is formed, and the\r\nbanner and guests are escorted to the City Hall, preceded by bands of\r\nmusic playing national airs. What a glorious sight! Man and nature seem\r\nto revel together in joy. The bright morning sunshine gleams from the\r\npolished rifles and a thousand flags wave in the light breeze, while the\r\nprocession is accompanied by crowds of men and women, boys and\r\nrosy-cheeked girls who, dressed in white and decked with red ribbons, in\r\nthe national costume and colors, add an element of bewitching beauty to\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other companies of riflemen have arrived, and the lake is\r\nstill covered with festively-adorned gondolas that are continually\r\nadding to the crowd of guests. At 10 o’clock the procession is again\r\nformed. It leaves the city and moves toward the “Seefeld,” a large\r\nmeadow on the shore of the lake, a short distance from the city. Here an\r\nimmense hall has been erected. Behind it are arranged the targets and\r\nshooting-stands, and opposite we see a neat structure in the form of a\r\ntemple, with many large windows, in which are exhibited the prizes,\r\ndisposed in the most attractive manner. These prizes are of the value of\r\n104,407 francs, and are the contributions of all parts of the\r\nworld--every corner where a few Swiss are to be found, having furnished\r\nsome small gift in honor of the national festival.\r\n\r\nThe procession halts in front of the temple. The Bernese deliver into\r\nthe hands of the Zurich delegation the flag of the Swiss Rifle Corps,\r\nand Colonel Kurtz, of Berne, thus briefly addresses them: “When two\r\nyears ago this flag was delivered into our safe keeping, peace reigned\r\nall around us; and but just now our country has come forth victoriously\r\nfrom a crisis in which we have shown, as, we had never done before, that\r\nwe are _one_ band of brethren.[5] What we have hoped for is now\r\nrealized, and we can carry this flag--the banner of the largest\r\nassociation in Switzerland--to the beautiful lake whose blue waters play\r\naround our sister town. We of Berne have held this flag in peace. Who\r\nknows whether you will be as fortunate, or whether you will be forced to\r\nplant it on the highest pinnacle of your good city, as a sign that the\r\nfatherland is in danger and calls upon her sons to defend her.\r\nRelentless war rages now on our borders;[6] we know not whether the\r\nstorm will pass over, or the thunderbolt strike in our midst.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: He alludes here to the Neufchatel difficulty. This\r\n    canton had been heretofore under the sovereignty of Prussia, and a\r\n    handful of royalists made the attempt to sever it from all\r\n    connection with the confederacy. The people defeated them and\r\n    voted themselves independent. Switzerland assisted them and\r\n    Prussia gave up whatever rights she might have had.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: The Italian.]\r\n\r\nDr. Dubs replies in a brilliant speech: “We receive this banner and\r\nshall defend it. We are ready now for a joyous feast, and as ready at\r\nany time for the war-dance. Let the trumpet sound and Zurich’s men will\r\nbe the first in the field to lead you on to victory or death!” etc.\r\n\r\nThus was the festival opened. A dinner had been prepared in the hall, to\r\nwhich all marksmen, whether from home or abroad, were invited. This hall\r\nis a wooden structure of large dimensions, open at the sides, with a\r\nwide passage running through the middle, intersected by several narrow\r\nones. In the middle of the building is a magnificent fountain. The whole\r\nremaining space is filled with tables and benches of unvarnished pine,\r\nat which 6,000 persons may be conveniently seated and served, A platform\r\nhung with Swiss banners is so placed that the speakers can be heard\r\nthrough the whole hall, and many a wise word has been thence spoken that\r\nmet a ready response from both present and distant brethren. Behind this\r\nplatform is raised a lofty gallery for the music. Here the bands play\r\nsoul-stirring chorals and national tunes, and when the “Marseillaise,”\r\nor other similar air is heard, a chorus of thousands of voices\r\naccompanies enthusiastically the instruments. It is in fact a feast of\r\nthe people; unity, peace and joy reign everywhere. There may be seen men\r\nof different religious and political creeds, embracing each other in\r\nbrotherly concord. Men whose language is Italian from the southern\r\ncantons, and men who speak French from the west, and German from the\r\nnorthern, eastern, and middle cantons, form _one_ family, though their\r\nlocalities, institutions, and interests may differ widely. The words\r\nwhich Schiller, in his well-known historical drama, “Tell,” causes\r\nRösselmann to express--\r\n\r\n  “By this fair light, which greeteth us before\r\n  Those other nations that, beneath us far,\r\n  In noisome cities pent, draw painful breath,\r\n  Swear we the oath of our confederacy!\r\n  We swear to be a nation of _true brothers_,\r\n  Never to part, in danger or in death!\r\n\r\nThese words have become true in our age.\r\n\r\nAt 1 o’clock the firing of a cannon announces the commencement of the\r\ntarget shooting. The marksmen press to the stands, and their shooting\r\ncontinues from morning till evening, with only an intermission of an\r\nhour for dinner, for an entire week. As we have before said, the\r\nshooting-stands are erected at the end of the hall, but in a separate\r\nbuilding. Ninety-six stands are arranged in one line, each with its own\r\ntarget, so that nearly a hundred shots may be fired at once. Behind each\r\nstand there is sufficient space for loading the rifles, and all the\r\nnecessary apparatus. There are smaller buildings near by for the\r\nrepairing of arms, and a regular field-hospital, completely furnished,\r\nto supply medical or surgical aid to such as may fall suddenly sick or\r\nbe wounded. The medical fraternity of Zurich have offered their services\r\nin turn, and two physicians of their number are always present day and\r\nnight. The shooting is directed towards the lake and large quantities of\r\nfirewood are piled up like a rampart around the grounds, so that an\r\naccident is almost impossible. Navigation on the lake within a certain\r\ndistance is also prohibited. The safety of the people is thus secured,\r\nand an accident can happen only at the stands or to a careless\r\ntarget-man. Only two injuries in all have been reported--a finger-wound\r\nreceived by a marksman, and the loss of an eye to a target-man by a\r\nsplinter from the target.\r\n\r\nMore than thirty thousand tried their skill during the ten days of the\r\nfestival. On the 7th of July 74,000 shots were fired, and about 61,000\r\non the 11th, though many of the people had already gone home. The rifles\r\nand targets are of various kinds. The Swiss have rifles for field\r\nservice, and also target rifles--the latter being much the heavier. No\r\nsupport whatever is used with either. The distance of the target is\r\nproportioned to the calibre of the rifles, the “field targets” being\r\nover a thousand, and the “stand targets” about six hundred feet distant.\r\nBoth the stand and field targets are sub-divided into “Stich” and\r\n“Kehrscheiben;” the former a single fixed target, the latter made double\r\nand turned around after each shot, so as to be immediately ready for\r\nanother marksman. The “Kehrscheiben” are designated by the letters in\r\nthe order of the alphabet; the “Stichscheiben” have names attached to\r\neach, such as “the Stand,” “Fatherland,” “Industry,” “Titlis,”\r\n“Pilatus,” “Rigi,” “Gotthard,” “Jungfrau,” “Splügen,” “the Field,” &c.\r\nNo more than one shot may be fired by the same marksman at any of the\r\n“Stichscheiben,” with the exception of the “Fatherland,” at which two\r\nare allowed. The number of shots at the “Kehrscheiben” is not limited,\r\nbut all must be paid for--the “Kehrscheiben” at the rate of about thirty\r\ncentimes, (six cents;) the “Stichscheiben” a little more. Commutation\r\ntickets, however, may be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe prizes are very various, but the most valuable are appropriated to\r\nthe “Stichscheiben.” The first prize this year was a large silver basin,\r\nof exquisite workmanship, together with 2,500 francs ($500) in money,\r\ngiven by the Swiss in Paris, to be won at the target “Fatherland.” The\r\nlowest prize is five francs, and this can be won only by those who\r\nsucceed in hitting the bull’s eye, the size of which varies in the\r\ndifferent targets. In the “Stichscheiben” for the target rifle it\r\nmeasures ten inches in diameter, but in the “Kehrscheiben” only two and\r\na half, while in the “Kehrscheiben” for the field rifle it measures six\r\ninches. Every six hits in the centre of the “Kehrscheiben” gains a prize\r\nof five francs, to which is added on the twenty-fifth successful shot, a\r\nsilver cup or watch. He who hits the bull’s eye fifty times receives\r\nanother prize of one hundred francs. Special prizes are also given to\r\nthe best marksman _of the day_, for the first and last hits _of the\r\nday_, and for the greatest number of hits during _the whole festival_,\r\netc. The prizes of the day may be obtained immediately; the others are\r\ndistributed publicly at the close of the festival.\r\n\r\nLet us now give a glance at the “Gift Temple.” This neat structure is\r\nmade wholly of glass, save the roof, in order that the rich prizes may\r\nbe more conspicuously exhibited. Here are gifts and prizes for the\r\nsuccessful shooters, consisting either in articles of value or in money,\r\nthat have been contributed by the cantonal governments and communities,\r\nand by individuals at home or abroad. The government has also had new\r\nSwiss five-franc pieces coined for this purpose, bearing on their face\r\nthe figure of a rifleman instead of Helvetia. There is many a piece of\r\nfine workmanship among the gifts, of which we can here only mention the\r\nsilver basin with the 2,500 francs, the first prize of the “Fatherland,”\r\nand a beautiful drinking horn of massive silver, richly embossed,\r\npresented by some friends in Leipsic. The Bremen sharp-shooters also\r\nbrought with them twelve “Römer,” large cups of massive silver, gilt\r\nwithin, which were admired and coveted by all the disciples of Bacchus.\r\nThis was not, however, the only present from the old Hanse-town. The\r\nsenate had opened the celebrated “Rathskeller” and sent some of their\r\nHock of the vintage of 1684, the Nestor of German wines, to their\r\nbrothers in Bacchus. The greater part of these gifts consisted in silver\r\ncups, and pitchers, and gold and silver watches.\r\n\r\nDuring the festival the houses of Zurich continued adorned with flags,\r\ntransparencies, and evergreens, which were every day entwined with fresh\r\nflowers. Near the festive hall a triumphal arch had been erected, on\r\nwhich stood a colossal figure of William Tell in the act of menacing\r\nGesler with the arrow, after having shot the apple from the head of his\r\nboy. Some of the critics would have us believe that Tell is not Tell,\r\nthat no such person ever existed, but that he is a purely mythical\r\ncharacter--the creation of Schiller’s imagination. Yet it matters little\r\nto the Swiss whether the hero was, or was not; all these thousands of\r\nmarksmen who daily pass that triumphal arch are possessed by one\r\nthought, and many can not refrain from shouting, “Hurrah for Tell,\r\nfather of the marksman! The Swiss of to-day is as skillful an archer, as\r\ndaring and as free as thou wast!” Myth or not, Tell is the man of the\r\npeople, the Washington of Switzerland--or, rather, Washington is the\r\nTell of America; and these words of the dying Attinghausen--\r\n\r\n  “Hold fast together, then--for ever fast.\r\n  Let freedom’s haunts be one in heart, in mind!\r\n  Set watches on your mountain tops, that league\r\n  May answer league, when comes the hour to strike.\r\n  Be _one_--be _one_--be _one_”--\r\n\r\nare never forgotten in these days by the inhabitants of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nAround the hall there has sprung up a village of wood and canvas, and\r\nwhile the men are engaged with their rifles, the women and children\r\ncrowd to see the circus, the menageries, rope-dancers, puppet-shows,\r\n“the giant Kentuckian,” “General Tom Thumb,” &c., and while every one\r\namuses himself, there is no rioting, no impropriety, no beggary, no\r\nplacards bidding us to “Beware of Pickpockets;” the people are as sound\r\nas their institutions.\r\n\r\nAt 8 o’clock in the morning the target shooting commences, closing at 8\r\nin the evening. The target and signal men are promptly at their\r\nstations, and the members of the different committees for keeping order,\r\narrive one by one. The marksmen are impatiently awaiting the signal\r\nshot. Spectators gather in from all sides. The signal is given, and in a\r\nmoment the sharp crack of ninety-six rifles is heard. The firing is kept\r\nup incessantly till noon, when the sound of the cannon again calls to\r\ndinner. At about 10 o’clock the first steamers have landed their\r\npassengers from “beyond the water,” and the first trains have come in,\r\nbringing new guests to supply the place of those who leave, so that new\r\nfaces and new acquaintances greet us every day. Here a fresh company of\r\nsharp-shooters from distant Ticino approaches, marching to the sound of\r\nmusic and preceded by their flag, and receive their welcome--there\r\nanother company from Neufchâtel is escorted to the station and takes its\r\ndeparture homeward.\r\n\r\nOne of the most joyous occurrences of the festival--a silvery gleam in\r\nthe general sunshine--was the reception of the marksmen from the four\r\nforest towns, Lucerne, Switz, Uri, and Unterwalden. They numbered full\r\nseven hundred men, noble specimens of the native Swiss, all picked\r\nmen--“Kernmannen.” They were preceded by four of their number attired in\r\nthe ancient national costume, who carried the very same bugles that for\r\nthe last five centuries had called their forefathers to arms. The\r\nancient banners followed. As they passed under the triumphal arch and\r\nbeheld their father, Tell, their shouts, hurrahs, and vivas, knew no\r\nbounds. Their ranks were broken and each threw himself upon the breast\r\nof the nearest stranger--nay, brother. The very men that perhaps were\r\nadversaries in public life, or opposed to each other in political\r\nprinciples, were here united; the love of fatherland was a common bond\r\nof union. Thus, also, Schiller speaks through the mouth of Meier:\r\n\r\n  “I know him well. There is a suit between us,\r\n  About a piece of ancient heritage;\r\n  Herr Reding, _we are enemies in court;\r\n  Here we are one_.”\r\n\r\nThus is it in Switzerland. Will it ever be so with us? Come, ye\r\neducators of the people and of the young, preach this principle from the\r\npulpit, and make it the corner stone of your instructions in the school\r\nand at the firesides of your homes!\r\n\r\nAt the signal for the noon intermission the firing immediately ceases,\r\nand in a few minutes 6,000 hungry and thirsty people are seated at the\r\none hundred and fifty tables in the hall; the rest disperse to the\r\neating-houses in the neighborhood and in the city. The dinner is\r\nenlivened by toasts which, however, are never of a personal character.\r\nNo homage is done to the individual; to the country, to the fatherland\r\nalone, is homage due in a republic. Toasts are heard in German, in\r\nFrench, in Italian--yet all tongues unite in the glorification of a\r\ncommon country. Separate tables are set for the different cantons, but\r\nso arranged that the more distant cantons are usually the nearest\r\ntogether--Ticino near Berne, Geneva near Basle, Zurich near Vaud. In the\r\nmiddle of the hall are the tables for the committees and the honorary\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nOn the second day of the festival the delegations of marksmen hold a\r\ngeneral conference, and though they enter the hall with opposing\r\nopinions and feelings, yet before they part all differences are settled,\r\nall contradictions are reconciled, and their resolutions are usually\r\nendorsed by the whole people. There is no tendency to disunion, no\r\nnecessity for secession, for each one endeavors to satisfy the wishes of\r\nthe other; the public weal is considered, not the interest or\r\naggrandizement of the individual or of the canton.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 10th of July, a public service was held on the meadow. It\r\nwas a solemn ceremony, attended by all the different creeds that hold\r\nfellowship together. On the next day the members of the Diet, which was\r\nthen in session at Berne, visited Zurich. The banished duchess of Parma,\r\nwho lives in the neighboring Swiss town, Pappenschwyl, was also the\r\nguest of the citizens. She and her children sat with them at the rough\r\npine board and partook of the same viands. After the dinner she said,\r\nwith tears in her eyes, “The Swiss do not know how happy they indeed\r\nare.”\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, July 12th, the last shot was fired, and on the following day\r\nthe prizes were distributed. This ceremony took place on the grounds\r\nbefore the gift temple. President Dubs opened with a speech, in which he\r\nsaid: “We are distributing now the prizes to those who have proved\r\nthemselves the best marksmen. An equal chance is given to all; let all\r\npractice with their weapons and emulate their lucky companions. I am\r\nconvinced that all who have hit the centre of the target will be able to\r\npierce the breast of the enemy, should war be unavoidable.” The first\r\nprize, the silver basin from Paris, with the 2,500 francs, was won by a\r\nmanufacturer, Durrer, of Unterwalden; the second, the silver horn from\r\nLeipzig, by a farmer named Glogg, of Obermeilen; the third, the twelve\r\nsilver cups from Bremen, jointly by Professor Dr. Hug, of the University\r\nof Zurich, and Mr. Baer, of Männedorf, the best shot in Switzerland, who\r\nhad hit the target four hundred and eighty-seven times during the\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\nThe whole was closed with a serenade, given by the marksmen to President\r\nDubs, the chief magistrate of the confederacy, as well as president of\r\nthe festival. The next day the remaining guests departed, the garlands\r\nand banners disappeared, the people returned to their business, all\r\nexternal show had vanished; but the feeling that Switzerland’s sons have\r\nagain renewed the bonds of their brotherhood still survives in the\r\nbreasts of that simple, quiet people--our republican brethren of the\r\nAlps.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS OF INSTRUCTION FOR OFFICERS.\r\n\r\nThe Federal system of Military Instruction for officers, in 1871,\r\nembraced--\r\n\r\nI. A Central Military School at Thun, to which all officers appointed to\r\nthe General Staff repair to be instructed in their duties.\r\n\r\nII. A School of Officers at Thun, in which all officers appointed to\r\ntheir respective regiments are instructed in their duties.\r\n\r\nIII. A School of Cantonal Instruction, held in Basle, to which the\r\ninfantry instructors resort from every canton to learn their duties,\r\nundergo inspection, and preserve a common rule.\r\n\r\nIV. A School of Young Officers, held at Solothurn and at St. Gallen,\r\nturn by turn, to which the several Cantons send their young officers who\r\nhave just received their commissions, and to which all candidates for\r\ncommissions repair for examinations.\r\n\r\nV. Comissariat School, to which is joined a Medical and Ambulance School\r\ngenerally, at Thun.\r\n\r\nVI. A Shooting School, for officers who give instruction to the Cadet\r\nCorps and other organizations in the several Cantons.\r\n\r\nTo these school organizations with their practical exercises must be\r\nadded the opportunities afforded by the Cantonal reviews and field\r\nmanœuvres, to which the young Swiss officer brings much valuable\r\nexperience in his previous school and cadet drill.\r\n\r\nThe events of the late French-Prussian war tested the efficiency of the\r\nSwiss military organization and instruction. The French declaration was\r\nannounced in Paris in the afternoon of Friday, July 15, 1870, and\r\nresponded to by a counter declaration from Berlin on Tuesday, the 19th.\r\nBut the Federal Council of Switzerland (which lay between the\r\ncombatants, and might become the first theatre of belligerent\r\noperations), was summoned by President Dubs to consider the situation;\r\nand within an hour, the Cantons had been regularly summoned to complete\r\ntheir regiments with men, arms, horses, guns, and all stores and tools\r\nrequired for actual service, and five divisions of the Elite (the first,\r\nsecond, sixth, seventh, and ninth), were ordered to assemble in their\r\nseveral Cantons. The first division, under Colonel Egtoff, was to secure\r\nthe bridge at Basle and occupy the two banks of the Rhine. The first\r\nnews which the men of Aargau had of the impending war was late on Friday\r\nnight. By noon on Saturday squads of men were falling into the ranks in\r\nfront of the town-hall of the cantonal capital--companies were\r\nformed--guns were got out--sappers, engineers, and guards were in\r\nreadiness--officers were at their posts. In the afternoon the first\r\nSwiss troops were in march for Basle, and by midnight the first regiment\r\nof Aargau were on the bridge; and by Sunday night the first division,\r\nunder Col, Egtoff, with 8,296 men, and 692 horses, besides the staff and\r\nguides; and the second division, under Colonel Salis, with 8,319 men,\r\nand 632 men at the same hour had assembled at Basle and held the roads\r\nand streams which led to Bonn. By Tuesday night, before the Prussian\r\nmanifest was known in Bonn, the five divisions of the first Swiss army,\r\nwith their eleven batteries of artillery mounting 96 field pieces, and a\r\ntotal force of 37,423 men, and 3,541 horses and 104 staff and guides,\r\nwere under arms and at their respective rendezvous; and the President\r\nwas authorized by the Council to announce to all concerned, “that any\r\ntroops belonging to belligerent states, whether regulars or volunteers,\r\nwho violate the territory of the Swiss nation, will be repelled by\r\nforce.”\r\n\r\nOut of the officers whose men were first in the field, the Federal\r\nCouncil placed Colonel Herzog, of the Aargau detachment of the Federal\r\narmy, in chief command, and by Saturday night the General’s\r\nhead-quarters were established at Alton (the center of the Swiss\r\nrailways), where he organized his staff, issued his instructions to\r\norganize two hospitals, one for wounded men, and the other for horses,\r\nand at the same time ordered magazines of stores and clothes to be\r\nestablished in his rear, and the forces to be moved up to the front. All\r\nrailway companies were ordered to report their stock of engines,\r\ncarriages, and open wagons, and telegraphic communication was\r\nestablished for night as well as day service, and engineers were sent\r\nout to study every pass and point by which an enemy in any strength was\r\nlikely to enter the territory of Switzerland. When all danger to the\r\nCantons had passed away in the victories of the German arms, Gen. Herzog\r\nwas directed to raise his camps, and send to their several Cantons their\r\nrespective troops. Later in the war, when it was authentically known\r\nthat Bourbaki was moving an army of 150,000 strong, to sweep across the\r\nRhine; and still later, that the Germans meant to push the French, in\r\neither whole or part, across the Swiss frontier, and put them out of\r\nservice for the rest of the war--General Herzog satisfied the President\r\nand the Council, and the Minister of War, of the impending danger, and\r\non Thursday, Jan. 19th, the third, fourth, and fifth divisions, with two\r\nbatteries of mountain guns, well prepared for winter service in a\r\ndistrict lying under snow, were ordered out; and in one week from that\r\ndate, these forces were distributed through the various passes in the\r\nJura, from Basle to Geneva, with orders to repel, or receive--to fight,\r\nor feed and lodge, according to the spirit in which the broken\r\ndetachments of the French army should present themselves. For the\r\nenormous number (83,301), who laid down their arms, food and beds were\r\ndistributed in the Swiss Cantons, by less than 20,000 citizen troops,\r\nwithout the forfeit of a single life. And when their work was done,\r\nthese citizen soldiers laid aside their arms and uniforms and returned\r\nto their shops and industries of various kinds, to earn their daily\r\nbread, without forgetting for a moment their civic rights and household\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nIf the occasion had required it, as it did in the war of Secession in\r\n1856, each Canton would have contributed 30 men from every 1,000\r\ninhabitants, to the Elite, and 15 men to every 1,000 to the Reserve; and\r\nin case of danger to the Union, every male Switzer, from the age of\r\nnineteen to forty-five, not included in either of the above forces,\r\nwould have obeyed the summons of the national authority for the\r\nLandwehr, adding 97,934 to the ranks, besides volunteering above and\r\nbelow the military age, to the number of 100,000 men, who, in case of a\r\ndefensive war, could have been relied on,--all familiar with military\r\ntactics, and accustomed to obey as soldiers, as well as to the use of\r\narms.\r\n\r\nAccording to recent official statistics the strength of the several\r\narmies of Switzerland is as follows:\r\n\r\n                           Elite.  Reserve.  Landwehr.\r\n  1. Engineers,             900       630    ......\r\n  2. Artillery,           6,513     4,254    ......\r\n  3. Cavalry,             1,937       932    ......\r\n  4.

MILITARY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States grants to Congress the power “to\r\nraise and support armies,” “to provide and maintain a navy,” “to make\r\nrules for the government of the land and naval forces; and to provide\r\nfor calling forth the militia,” as well as “for organizing, arming and\r\ndisciplining” the same, and for governing such parts of them as may be\r\nemployed in the service of the United States--reserving to the States,\r\nrespectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of\r\ntraining the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress.\r\nBy the same instrument the President is made commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy and navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several\r\nStates when called into actual service of the United States “to execute\r\nthe laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.”\r\n\r\nBy law of August, 1789, a department of war, and in 1798, a secretary of\r\nthe navy is provided to aid the President in the administration of\r\nmilitary and naval affairs; and the original rules and articles of war\r\nenacted by the Congress of 1776, were continued in force, and in 1806\r\nmade the basis of the military code which has since governed all troops\r\nmustered into the service of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1790 the rank and file of the regular army was fixed at 1,216 men. In\r\n1796 this force was organized into one corps of artillerists and\r\nengineers, whose head-quarters was at West Point, two companies of light\r\ndragoons, and four regiments of infantry of eight companies each. This\r\nforce was increased by additional regiments in the war of 1812, the\r\nIndian war in Florida, and the war with Mexico, till in 1861, the army\r\nconsisted of 14,000 men, stationed in the different forts and garrisons,\r\nand mainly on the Indian frontier. In the war of the Rebellion the\r\nregular army was increased to 50,000 men.\r\n\r\nBy act of July 15,1870, the number of enlisted men was reduced to 30,000\r\nby or before July 1, 1871. On the 20th of October, 1871, the army was\r\ncomposed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Two regiments of Cavalry,               8,800 enlisted men.\r\n  Five regiments of Artillery,            3,105   “       “\r\n  Twenty-five regiments of Infantry,     23,742   “       “\r\n  One battalion of Engineers,               314   “       “\r\n  Ordnance Department,                      444   “       “\r\n  West Point Detachment,                    202   “       “\r\n  Signal Department,                        199   “       “\r\n  Hospital stewards,                        310   “       “\r\n  Ordnance Surgeons,                        114   “       “\r\n  Available Recruits, _en route_,           349   “       “\r\n  Permanent Recruiting Parties,             904   “       “\r\n  General Service Men,                      420   “       “\r\n                                         ------\r\n        Total,                           29,003\r\n  Commissioned Officers,                  2,105\r\n  Retired Officers,                         295\r\n\r\nWhen the insurrectionary movements and combinations of the Southern\r\nStates in 1861, proved too powerful to be suppressed by ordinary civil\r\npowers, the President, April 15, called for 75,000 volunteers for three\r\nmonths, to defend the capital, and May 3, 42,000 to serve for three\r\nyears or during the war. On the 22d of July he was authorized to accept\r\nthe services of 500,000, which, within six months afterwards was\r\nincreased to 1,000,000. This force proving inadequate, a levy of 300,000\r\nmen was ordered in 1863, and in 1864, another call for 500,000\r\nmen--making an aggregate of 2,653,062 mustered into the service of the\r\nUnited States, or nearly one fourth of the entire male population of the\r\nNorthern States. This entire force was disbanded within one year from\r\nthe close of the war.\r\n\r\nThe development of the naval resources of the country was quite as\r\nmarvelous. In 1861 the entire navy consisted of 94 war vessels of all\r\nclasses and in all conditions, capable when in service of carrying 2,415\r\nguns. Only 43 of these ships were in commission, and the seamen and\r\nmariners numbered 7,000. In less than three years 200 war vessels were\r\nconstructed and 418 merchant vessels were converted to military service,\r\nand over 50,000 men enlisted in the naval service.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States in rebellion put into the field over 500,000 men,\r\nand exhausted their pecuniary resources, with the loss of 300,000\r\nsoldiers on the field or in hospital.\r\n\r\nThe debt of the United States contracted in the prosecution of the war,\r\nstood in 1866 at the enormous sum of $2,783,425,879.\r\n\r\nThese extraordinary efforts were made under circumstances which are not\r\nlikely to exist again, and such expenditures could not be repeated\r\nwithout national bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nThe Militia of the United States, by act of Congress of 1792, consists\r\nof all white male citizens between the ages of 18 and 45, who must be\r\nenrolled and arranged into brigades, regiments, and companies, as the\r\nlegislature of each State may direct. Of the militia, as organized by\r\nstate legislation, the governor is commander-in-chief, except when\r\ncalled into the service of the United States. To provide arms and\r\nequipments for the whole body of militia, arsenals and armories are\r\nprovided by Congress, in different parts of the country, at an annual\r\ncharge of $200,000 (since 1808).\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any official information respecting the number and\r\ncondition of the Militia of the several States,[1] we gather the\r\nfollowing statistics from a pamphlet by General J. W. Hoffman, of\r\nPhiladelphia, on the subject of the National Guard.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: The Militia System was broken up by the Volunteer\r\n    System introduced by the United States and encouraged by State\r\n    Legislation, and now (1872) even formal returns as to enrollment\r\n    are not complied with by a majority of the States.]\r\n\r\n  _State.

Of the number of regiments or\r\ncompanies--their officers and men, distinct from the enrolled and\r\norganized State Militia, we have no official statistics.\r\n\r\nMODE OF OFFICERING THE ARMY.\r\n\r\nThe commissioned officers of the United States army are drawn from three\r\nsources:--_First_, from the cadets of the Military Academy at West\r\nPoint; _Second_, from civil life; _Third_, from the rank and file.\r\n\r\n1. The appointment to the grade of lieutenant in either corps, follows\r\nregularly to any cadet on graduation, after having completed the course\r\nof instruction at West Point. From 1815 to 1832, the army was officered\r\nalmost exclusively from the Military Academy.\r\n\r\n2. The expansion of the military force consequent on the Indian war in\r\nFlorida, from 1832 to 1837, and the Mexican war from 1845 to 1848, and\r\nof the Civil war from 1861 to 1865, was followed by the appointment of\r\nmany persons from civil life, who had received no military training, and\r\nwithout any special qualifications beyond personal and political\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\r\nAs a stimulus and reward to special service, promotions are occasionally\r\nmade from the rank and file, after a mere formal examination in the\r\nelementary branches of a common school education, and without the\r\nprovision for professional training except such as can be got from\r\nobservation and private reading.\r\n\r\nPROFESSIONAL INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING OF OFFICERS.\r\n\r\nIn the organization and movements of the armed forces of the Colonies,\r\nthe officers were trained in the military service of the mother country.\r\n\r\nIn the War of Independence, the general spirit of the people supplied\r\nfor a time the want of trained soldiers and officers, beyond the small\r\nforce which had been schooled in the French and Indian Wars; but the\r\nnecessities of the service compelled Congress to authorize its\r\naccredited agents abroad to offer commissions, especially to engineer\r\nand artillery officers; and at the close of the war we find nearly all\r\nthe prominent officers in the artillery and engineer departments had\r\nbeen trained abroad. Nearly all the fortifications were planned by them\r\nand erected under their supervision. The names of Steuben, Kosciusko, Du\r\nPortail, Radière, Romans, Vincent, Rochefontaine, Toussard, Revardi,\r\nL’Enfant, Villefranche, and others of later date, will suggest to any\r\nreader of the military history of the country, the extent of our\r\nobligations to foreign military schools.\r\n\r\nThe sources of systematic professional instruction and training for\r\nofficers of the armed forces of the United States, are--\r\n\r\n  I. The National Military Academy at West Point, for the general\r\nscientific instruction of officers of all arms.\r\n\r\n  II. The Practical School of Artillery at Fortress Monroe.\r\n\r\n  III. The Engineer Battalion School of Practice at Hunter’s Point.\r\n\r\n  IV. The Company and Regimental Drill of various Volunteer Corps in the\r\nlarger cities of the country.\r\n\r\n  V. The Cadet Corps in various Military and Scientific Schools in\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\nThe gradual development of the military Academy at West Point, and the\r\npresent condition of Military Education will now be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY ACADEMY AT WEST POINT\r\n\r\nI. ORIGIN AND HISTORY. PERIOD I.--1802-1812.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the United States Military Academy upon education, as\r\nwell as its wide reputation as a school of science, render an inquiry\r\ninto its rise and progress, a subject both of interest and profit. Since\r\nit is mind, rather than any system of forms and studies, which gives\r\npower to such institutions, a mere statement of dates and facts is\r\ninsufficient to give us a just view of its character. We must, if\r\npossible, trace the spirit of the men who guided, and the principles\r\nimpressed upon it. To do this, we shall resort, not merely to the record\r\nof events, but to our memory of men and acts, with which we were for\r\nyears familiar.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected, that schools of refined, scientific art\r\nshould be founded by small colonies in the wilderness of the new world.\r\nWhen even their clergymen must resort to Europe for education, and their\r\nlawyers for license, it was in vain to expect their soldiers to be\r\naccomplished engineers. When the revolutionary war came on, this fact\r\nbecame a painful experience. No man felt it more than Washington. With a\r\npeople, whose patriotism was unquenchable; with soldiers, who rivaled\r\nthe warriors of Leonidas, he found the best and truest of men, with the\r\nsmallest possible share of military science. He was obliged to depend on\r\nEuropean engineers for a skill which his countrymen did not possess;\r\nwhile their European ideas, and artificial habits were displeasing to\r\nhis American principles.[2] He felt military instruction to be a primary\r\nwant in the country. Accordingly, he was the real founder of the\r\nMilitary Academy; that is, he put forth the _germinal idea_. What the\r\nplan of it was to be, and what shape it should ultimately take, he did\r\nnot state, and probably had not thought of; for Washington in the office\r\nof president, seldom meddled with the details of public affairs. What he\r\nmeant to obtain, however, he distinctly stated, in his message, dated\r\nDecember 3rd, 1793; in referring to measures of national defense, he\r\nsays an inquiry may be made: “whether your own experience, in the\r\nseveral states has not detected some imperfection in the scheme; and\r\nwhether a material feature in the improvement of it ought not to be to\r\nafford an opportunity for the _study of those branches of the military\r\nart which can scarcely ever be obtained by practice alone_.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Prepared by Major E. D. Mansfield, a graduate of West\r\n    Point in 1819, for Barnard’s American Journal of Education, March,\r\n    1862.]\r\n\r\nIn his message of December 7th, 1796, he said: “Whatever, argument may\r\nbe drawn, from particular examples, superficially viewed, a thorough\r\nexamination of the subject will evince that the art of war is at once\r\ncomprehensive and complicated; that it demands much previous study, and\r\nthat the profession of it in its most improved and perfect state, is\r\nalways of great moment to the security of a nation. This, therefore,\r\nought to be a serious care of every government; _and for this purpose an\r\nacademy, where a regular course of instruction is given_, is an obvious\r\nexpedient, which different nations have employed.”[3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: It is not meant to say that this subject was not\r\n    mentioned before. It was by Col. Pickering, in 1783. But whoever\r\n    reads the letters and memoirs of Washington, will see, that all\r\n    the early ideas on the subject of military education and military\r\n    science were derived from the experience of Washington.]\r\n\r\nThe views, always entertained, and repeatedly expressed by General\r\nWashington, were adopted by Mr. Adams, and Mr. McHenry, secretary of\r\nwar, in his administration, made an elaborate report on this subject,\r\nwhich was transmitted to congress, on 10th of December, 1800. It is due\r\nto Mr. McHenry, to say that his ideas of what ought to be a course of\r\nmilitary instruction, were far in advance of what were actually\r\nprovided, till after the war of 1812-’15 proved his ideas to be correct.\r\nIn 1794, prior to the last message of Washington, congress attempted to\r\nsupply the want of a military academy, by attaching cadets to the corps\r\nof artillerists, and engineers. This corps consisted of four battalions,\r\nto each of which eight cadets were to be attached. This made the whole\r\nnumber of cadets thirty-two; and for this corps of artillerists,\r\nengineers and cadets, the secretary of war was directed to procure\r\nbooks, instruments and apparatus. The term _cadet_ signifying in French,\r\nthe youngest brother of a family, and in Spanish, a young volunteer\r\nofficer, became naturally applied to young men, who were junior,\r\nvolunteer officers. In England, the _cadet_ of a family was a young son,\r\nwho volunteered for the India service; and in the United States has been\r\nproperly applied to the youth, who enter the military academy.\r\n\r\nIt seems from the message of Washington, in 1796, that the attempt at\r\nmilitary instruction, was a failure. No place, no teachers, no studies,\r\nwere appointed. It was on the 16th of March, 1802, in the early\r\nadministration of Mr. Jefferson, that congress established, by that\r\nname, the _Military Academy_. It was still made part of an army corps;\r\nthe idea of making a separate institution for scientific studies not\r\nbeing yet matured. The artillerists and engineers were made two distinct\r\ncorps, of which there were forty cadets of artillery and ten of\r\nengineers. The corps of engineers consisted of a major, two captains,\r\nfour lieutenants, and ten cadets, making seventeen in all. _The corps\r\nconstituted the military academy_, established at West Point, in the\r\nState of New York. So little idea was then entertained of the true\r\nobjects and mode of scientific instruction, that the law required the\r\ncadet, as well as officer, to do duty in any part of the United States.\r\nIn other words, the only idea of the military academy, at that time, was\r\n_a place appointed where the officers of engineers might give or receive\r\ninstruction, when not on other duty_. The actual academy, such as it\r\nwas, conformed to that idea. The major of engineers was the commander,\r\nor superintendent. The two captains were instructors, and the cadets\r\nwere pupils. It was, as a school, an inchoate existence, without regular\r\nteachers, or limited studies, or proper discipline. Yet, even in this\r\nimperfect condition, it did, as we shall see, some service which ought\r\nto be gratefully remembered.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, let us turn for a moment, to the _place_ which is so\r\nmemorable in the annals of this country, and is now so intimately\r\nassociated with science. If Dr. Beattie is correct in saying that the\r\ncharacter of the mind is much associated with natural scenery, no place\r\nin America could have been more wisely selected, as the site of a\r\nnational institution. World renowned, as West Point justly is, there is\r\nthat in its scenery and associations, more interesting to a poetic or a\r\npatriotic mind, than its famed Academy. Its green plain, hidden amidst\r\nits mountains; its craggy summits; its rocky barriers; its dark\r\nevergreens; its darker waters, flowing on forever; that beautiful view\r\nof town and country, seen through the frowning brows of Crow Nest and\r\nthe Beacon; that quiet vale, where Washington oft bent his steps; those\r\nlonely little mounds, where the soldiers of the Revolution repose; these\r\nforts and ramparts now indistinctly seen, which once guarded these\r\nmountain passes; yon ledge of rocks, where Kosciusko once made his\r\nlittle garden; all these and other memorable things, call up whatever is\r\nsublime in nature, or noble in history. It is impossible to forget them.\r\nIt is impossible for the dullest mind, not to have its sensibilities\r\nexcited, or its character elevated by the contemplation of such sublime\r\nscenes, or such interesting events. When such a spot becomes the place\r\nof our education, its memories become poetic; its associations mingle\r\nwith the flow of life, and the structure of our minds.\r\n\r\nTo return. The law having authorized this ideal Academy, it was\r\nimmediately instituted, by the appointment of officers. The Academy, it\r\nis seen, was on quite a small scale. In fact, so far as teaching was\r\nconcerned, the Academy consisted of two captains of engineers and ten\r\ncadets. The two captains were WILLIAM H. BARRON and JARED MANSFIELD. Mr.\r\nMansfield had been a teacher of mathematics, navigation, and the\r\nclassics, first at New Haven, (Conn.,) and then at Philadelphia. He had\r\nwritten a volume of “Essays” on mathematics and physics, quite original,\r\nand distinguishing him at that time, as the first mathematician of his\r\ncountry. This was brought to the notice of Mr. Jefferson, who with no\r\ngreat love of military affairs, was a warm friend of science. When the\r\nact was passed authorizing the Military Academy, Mr. Jefferson wrote to\r\nMr. Mansfield, that he would appoint him a captain of engineers, for the\r\n_very purpose of becoming a teacher at West Point_. Accordingly he was\r\nappointed, on May 3rd, 1802; Captain Barron had been appointed in April.\r\nThen, in May 1802, the actual Military Academy was constituted, Captains\r\nBarron and Mansfield being teachers of mathematics and philosophy, to\r\nsome half dozen or more cadets and lieutenants. No professor of\r\nengineering or of any other department was appointed before 1812. In\r\npursuing the course and growth of instruction at West Point, during this\r\nperiod of ten years, we can only refer to the services of the\r\ninstructors and graduates. In fact, there were no graduates prior to\r\n1815; but there were _appointments_ made from the cadets of the Military\r\nAcademy, after more or less study at West Point. To understand what was\r\ndone, we must refer to the actions of teachers and cadets, rather than\r\nto history. Its teachers were few and its annals brief. Captain\r\nMansfield, after a year’s teaching at West Point, was in 1808, appointed\r\nby Mr. Jefferson, to a more responsible position. It was necessary to\r\nthe correctness of our public surveys, that the meridian lines and the\r\nbase lines (which are co-ordinates,) should be established with\r\nastronomical accuracy. For this purpose, Captain Mansfield was appointed\r\nsurveyor general of the north-western territory; furnished with\r\nastronomical instruments, and taking his residence in Ohio, proceeded to\r\nestablish and perfect that beautiful system of surveys, by which the\r\nnorth-western states are distinguished. Retaining his military bent,\r\nwith a view to his original destination at West Point, he actually\r\nreturned there in 1814, to recommence, as we shall see hereafter, his\r\ncareer as an instructor in the national institution. Of Captain Barron,\r\nhis co-teacher, we only know that he was relieved in February, 1807. At\r\nthe same time, his successor, FERDINAND R. HASSLER, was appointed, and\r\nremained till he resigned in 1810. Mr. Hassler was, we believe, a Swiss\r\nby birth. He wrote a small treatise on mathematics, and had quite an\r\nextensive reputation, as a mathematician, but was said to be too\r\nanalytical and refined in the character of his mind, for American\r\npractical habits. He was intended for the coast survey, and, we believe,\r\nactually commenced it.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1806, ALDEN PARTRIDGE, superintendent of engineers, was\r\nappointed _acting assistant_ professor of mathematics, and retained that\r\nposition till April, 1812.\r\n\r\nThe “Teacherships” of French and drawing were created, by the act of\r\nFebruary, 1803, being a very important addition to the original scheme\r\nof the Academy. To the teachership of French, FRANCIS DE MASSON was\r\nappointed, March, 1804, and resigned in March, 1812. To the teachership\r\nof drawing, CHRISTIAN E. ZOELLER was appointed, September, 1808, and\r\nresigned in April, 1810. Mr. Masson was a Frenchman by birth; Mr.\r\nZoeller, a Swiss. Mr. Masson was highly spoken of by Colonel Williams, a\r\ngood judge of what constitutes a scholar. Mr. Zoeller was an amiable\r\nman, of no high attainments, whose instruction in drawing was wholly\r\nconfined to the military part, fortifications and bridges.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief history, it appears, that there were but six teachers at\r\nWest Point, between 1802 and 1812. Of these, no more than four were ever\r\npresent at one time, and that only between 1808 and 1810. The teachers\r\npresent, each year, were as follows:\r\n\r\n  1802-1803,   Captain Barron, Mathematics.\r\n               Captain Mansfield, Philosophy.\r\n  1804-1806,   Captain Barron,        “\r\n               Francis Masson, French.\r\n  1806-1807,   Captain Barron, Mathematics.\r\n               Francis Masson, French.\r\n               Alden Partridge, Mathematics.\r\n  1808-1810,   Ferdinand Hassler,    “\r\n               Alden Partridge,      “\r\n               Francis Masson, French.\r\n               Christian Zoeller, Drawing.\r\n  1810-1812,   Alden Partridge, Mathematics.\r\n               Francis Masson, French.\r\n\r\nThis glance at the actual teachers of West Point enables us to see at a\r\nglance, what was done. No continuous study was pursued at all, except\r\nmathematics. For the eight years, between 1804 and 1812, French was\r\ntaught by an able professor, Mr. Masson, and from 1808 to 1810, drawing.\r\nIn 1812, this inchoate existence of the Academy was ended by the act of\r\ncongress, reorganizing the institution, and placing it on a permanent\r\nand extensive foundation. The next period of five years, from 1812 to\r\n1817, was the _forming_ period of the Academy. In some respects, its\r\nelements were chaotic. In others, its _personnel_ was inefficient and\r\ninharmonious. In others, again, its materials of instruction were\r\ninadequate. From this condition it finally emerged, and attained its\r\npresent high character and usefulness. The history of this change is\r\nimportant, if not interesting to those who would understand what are the\r\ntrue foundations of a great school of education. In the meanwhile, let\r\nus return to what the CADETS of the Academy had done. If they were few,\r\nand with small means of instruction, they may nevertheless have shown\r\nthat the Academy was not altogether fruitless. How many cadets were\r\nappointed between 1802 and 1812, we do not exactly know, but we have the\r\nnumber appointed _from the Academy_. The number of cadets promoted from\r\nthe Academy during that period were for each year, thus:\r\n\r\n  In 1802,      2.\r\n  In 1803,      3.\r\n  In 1804,      2.\r\n  In 1805,      3.\r\n  In 1806,     15.\r\n  In 1807,      5.\r\n  In 1808,     15.\r\n  In 1809,      7.\r\n  In 1811,     19.\r\n  In 1812,     18.\r\n\r\nThis makes eighty-nine in ten years. Let us look at their career, as\r\nstated in the brief annals of the army; or, as they are retained in\r\nmemory. Of this number, comprising ten cadets of more than half a\r\ncentury ago, this is the result:\r\n\r\n  Killed in battle,   10.\r\n  Died in service,    21.\r\n  In service,          7.\r\n  Resigned,           33.\r\n  Disbanded,          10.\r\n  Dropped,             3.\r\n  Dismissed,           4.\r\n  Declined,            1.\r\n\r\nThis is no bad roll. If we were to search our college rolls for those\r\nwho had been really useful, those who died in battle, or served to the\r\nend, or entered other fields of usefulness, or now live in the\r\nperformance of duty, we should find a less grateful exhibition than\r\nthis. The number of those who had been “dropped,” or “dismissed,” for\r\nincompetence, or vice, would be far greater. Alas! if we could read the\r\nsecret history of the college roll, how sad would be that account! We\r\nknow, that in times past, many of the officers of the army were addicted\r\nto dissipation. Happily, we can say, many less now. But since we would\r\nestimate the value of the Military Academy, even in its most imperfect\r\ncondition, let us see _who_ some of these men were.\r\n\r\nThe first cadet appointed was General JOSEPH G. SWIFT,[4] who having\r\nrisen to the rank of general of engineers and inspector of the Military\r\nAcademy, resigned, became surveyor of the port of New York, and is now a\r\nvenerable and respected citizen of Geneva. Of those who were killed in\r\nbattle, _Eleazer D. Wood_, (whose monument stands at West Point,) was\r\nkilled while loading a cannon, in the sortie from Fort Erie. Five others\r\nwere killed on the Canada frontier, and four in battle with the Indians.\r\nOf those who died in service, _two_ reached the rank of general, and\r\n_eight_ that of field officers. Of those who are now in service, (7,)\r\none is General JOSEPH G. TOTTEN, chief of the corps of engineers, who\r\nserved on the Canada frontier in the war of 1812, and at the siege of\r\nVera Cruz. One is Col. SYLVANUS THAYER, who served in the war of\r\n1812-’15; who was superintendent of the Military Academy from 1817 to\r\n1833, and to whom it is indebted for a large part of its usefulness. Of\r\nthese gentlemen, we shall have more to say, when we refer to the forming\r\nperiod of the institution. Another is Colonel RENE DE RUSSY, who was\r\ndistinguished in the battle of Plattsburg, and became superintendent of\r\nthe Academy on the retirement of Col. Thayer. Of those who resigned or\r\nwere disbanded, many died young; one became a member of congress and\r\npolitician; and another, Col. WILLIAM MCREE, was a remarkable man,\r\ndistinguished for gallant conduct in the battle of Niagara and Fort\r\nErie, a member of the board of engineers, and of cultivated mind; he\r\nresigned from the army and became surveyor general for Missouri and\r\nArkansas, and finally died of cholera at St. Louis. Of the whole\r\neighty-nine, who were commissioned prior to 1813, but twenty-one were\r\nalive in 1850, and several others have died since. The few who now\r\nremain have seen more than half a century’s service in useful\r\nemployments. Perhaps it should be mentioned to the advantage of the\r\nMilitary Academy, as a school of physical education, that at the end of\r\nhalf a century, twenty of its pupils out of eighty-nine, should be yet\r\nalive. In twenty years of civil life, as appears from the United States\r\ncensus of 1830 and 1850, more than the same proportion of youth between\r\nten and twenty years of age perished. The general strength and health of\r\nthe pupils of West Point are beyond a doubt greater than that of the\r\nsame number of young men brought up in the ordinary methods of\r\neducation. This is not wholly due to physical exercises, but also to\r\nmoral education, and to the care and comforts of their mode of life.\r\nWill any one deny that _discipline_ is a part of moral education? Is not\r\nself-restraint, the regularity of habits, and the art of using the mind\r\nin intellectual pursuits, the most important elements of a moral\r\neducation? It is to all these, and not merely the training and exercise\r\nof arms, that the eléves of the Academy owe so large a share of the\r\nhealth and strength of life.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: The _first_ diploma, which we suppose was a\r\n    manuscript certificate, was the one given to the then Cadet SWIFT,\r\n    and signed by Captains Barron and Mansfield.]\r\n\r\nIn the period of its history which we have now examined, the Military\r\nAcademy was really only in the germ of its existence. Like most other\r\nuseful or remarkable enterprises, it was first thought of as a thing\r\nneeded; then began without any clear idea of what it would become, and\r\nwas then improved upon, till it grew to be of magnitude and importance.\r\n\r\nPERIOD II.--1812-1825.\r\n\r\nThe Academy, in its germinal existence, whose history we have briefly\r\ntraced, was obviously inadequate to supply the army and country with\r\nyoung men instructed in the art of war. Congress authorized the\r\nappointment of a large number of cadets. But the President did not act\r\nupon it, because there were neither professors, nor books, nor quarters,\r\nnor material at West Point for their training. In 1808, Mr. Jefferson\r\nrecommended an enlargement of the Academy. In 1810, Mr. Madison did the\r\nsame. In vain, however, were these recommendations, till the nation was\r\nroused from its indolent repose by the sudden shock of war. In 1811, the\r\nbattle of Tippecanoe electrified the people. The war-whoop sounded on\r\nthe north-western frontier, and the aggressive conduct of Great Britain\r\nbecame insufferable. War was an imperious necessity. Then it was that\r\nthe use if not necessity of an institution for military training became\r\nobvious to all reflecting minds. In April, 1812, the act was passed\r\nwhich erected the frame-work of the present Military Academy. As this\r\nlegal outline has been little changed since, it is necessary that we\r\nshould look to its provisions, for correct ideas of what the law\r\nintended, and what has been substantially carried out in its growth and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n1st. It was provided, that the number of cadets might be increased to\r\ntwo hundred and fifty, and attached at the discretion of the President\r\nas students to the Military Academy at West Point, and be subject to the\r\nregulations thereof.\r\n\r\n2d. That these cadets should be between the ages of fourteen and\r\ntwenty-one, and previous to his appointment should be well versed in\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic.\r\n\r\n3d. That the Military Academy should consist of the Corps of Engineers,\r\nthe Professors of Philosophy, of Mathematics, of Engineering, with their\r\nassistants, and the teachers of French and Drawing.\r\n\r\n4th. That when any cadet shall receive a regular degree from the\r\nAcademical Staff, he shall be considered a candidate for a commission in\r\nany corps for which he shall be deemed competent.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these provisions for education, money was appropriated\r\nfor buildings and books, and for a band of music. The expenditure\r\nprovided for was very small, compared with the need of the Academy; but\r\nit was enough for a beginning. It was far easier, as we shall see, to\r\nprovide for all its material wants, than to bring it into that state of\r\nmoral and intellectual discipline, which was essential to the attainment\r\nof great results. The institution, in its former period, was in an\r\ninchoate condition. A few young officers, raised up partly as teachers,\r\nand partly as pupils, without a course of studies, without regulations,\r\nand without discipline, could furnish no just ideas, from experience, of\r\nwhat a highly intellectual, well-ordered school of science should be;\r\nand accordingly the want of just ideas of education was precisely what\r\nfirst stood in the way of making West Point what it subsequently became.\r\n\r\nFor more than five years there was a wrestling between old and new\r\nideas. There was a positive ignorance of what high education should be.\r\nIn fact, the country had no models for it. Then there were old habits to\r\novercome. Lastly, there was a willfulness on the part of some in\r\nauthority, opposed as long as opposition was possible, to any new idea\r\nof things. For people are aware, in this day of change and novelty, how\r\nstrongly the _vis inertiæ_ of intellectual habits opposes intellectual\r\nimprovement. This very _vis inertiæ_, at first, almost nullified the\r\npower of law itself to improve and enlarge the studies at West Point.\r\nHow it acted we shall see. The first difficulty at West Point was,\r\n(after preparing the accommodations and material) in complying with the\r\nspirit of the law, and placing the _academic instruction on the high\r\nground really intended_. To understand this we must here advert to some\r\nprovisions of the law which were either overlooked or neglected. First,\r\nthe law expressly recognized an _Academic Staff_, who should confer\r\n_degrees_. Secondly, that the cadets of West Point should be _students_,\r\nsubject to the _regulations of the Academy_. All this evidently meant\r\nthat these two hundred and fifty young men should be placed, like\r\nstudents in college, under regular academic instruction, and that the\r\nprofessors and teachers should constitute an academic faculty, with\r\npower to regulate the education of the cadets, and confer degrees\r\naccording to merit. Ultimately this was accomplished; but it took much\r\neffort on the part of the Professors to bring the military authorities\r\ninto a just conception of this scheme. During the years 1812 and 1813,\r\nlittle was done except in commencing buildings, buying apparatus,\r\nappointing the cadets, and getting ready for the real business of the\r\ninstitution. Here we must record the first academic faculty organized at\r\nWest Point. The professorship of Natural and Experimental Philosophy,\r\nwhich was higher in rank and emoluments than the others, was instituted\r\nexpressly for Col. JARED MANSFIELD, who, having retained his commission\r\nin the corps of engineers, while he was surveyor-general in the\r\nnorth-western states, was now (October, 1812,) appointed to the same\r\nprofessorship which he held ten years before. ANDREW ELLICOTT, who had\r\nbeen astronomer of the United States, and had a wide reputation for\r\nmathematical knowledge, was appointed professor of Mathematics, in\r\nSeptember, 1813, at which time, also, ALDEN PARTRIDGE was appointed\r\nprofessor of Engineering. The teacher of drawing was CHRISTIAN E.\r\nZOELLER, reappointed; and of French, FLORIMOND DE MASSON. This was the\r\nfirst academic faculty. Subsequently, the principal professors were\r\nallowed assistants, and other teachers were at still later periods\r\nprovided in the departments of Ethics, Tactics, Artillery, Chemistry,\r\n&c., as the institution was enlarged, and its wants were better known.\r\nThe gentlemen above named were, however, the first professors and the\r\nfirst faculty. They had the real _labor_ and responsibility of taking\r\nthe initial steps, and to a large extent, of forming the Military\r\nAcademy. At the very first step a difficulty occurred, which could not\r\nhave been anticipated. Captain ALDEN PARTRIDGE, (who was professor of\r\nEngineering) was superintendent of West Point, from January, 1815, to\r\nNovember, 1816--nearly two years. He was a man of strong will; of\r\nindependent and rather eccentric ideas, who quite naturally as a\r\nmilitary man, long resident at the Point, wished to forget that the law\r\nrequired the education of the institution to be decided by an academic\r\nfaculty, and governed by regulations. He chose rather to remember that\r\nit was a military post, governed by a military commandant, and sought to\r\ngratify his own ambition by grasping its sole direction. Professors\r\nMansfield and Ellicott, who held no command in the army, took a\r\ndifferent view of the subject. They justly thought, that the object of\r\nthe institution was to give a thorough _scientific education_,\r\nespecially adapted to the art of war; that this required discipline, and\r\na course of studies systematic and complete; and that all this was\r\nevidently contemplated by the law, which said that the Academy should be\r\ngoverned by regulations, and hence an academic faculty. This difference\r\nof opinion was vital. It led to a controversy of two years, which\r\nbelongs to the private rather than the public history of the Academy.\r\nLittle of it was known to the public, and we are now concerned only in\r\nthe issue. Had the views of Captain Partridge prevailed, the institution\r\nnever could have become what it is.[5] Fortunately, the Professors had\r\nthe law on their side, and also the good opinion of the administration,\r\nand eventually gave to the scientific college the cast and features\r\nwhich it now has. For three years, between 1814 and 1817, this internal\r\ncontroversy continued, gradually tending to give the Academy a\r\nsystematic organization. General JOSEPH G. SWIFT, (head of the corps of\r\nengineers,) who was officially inspector of the Academy, took up his\r\nresidence at West Point, in November, 1816, but remained only two\r\nmonths. While there, there could be no controversy, as to the government\r\nof the Academy, since the commander of engineers was legally its chief.\r\nAfter the removal of General Swift, Captain Partridge, as senior\r\nofficer, again took command. It was determined, however, to remove him;\r\nand the Government most fortunately hit upon an officer, whose\r\ncharacter, education, and accomplishments, most eminently fitted him for\r\nthe post of governing, and disciplining the young men, who were in turn\r\nto become the _savans_ as well as the ornaments of their country. This\r\nofficer was SYLVANUS THAYER, a native of Massachusetts, commissioner in\r\n1808 from West Point to the engineer corps, and who had recently\r\ntraveled in Europe, examining the military schools of France and\r\nGermany. The arrival of Colonel Thayer constitutes the most important\r\nepoch in the history of West Point. Why it is so will appear evident\r\nwhen we trace out the _scientific culture_ of the Academy, and the\r\ndiscipline which it furnishes. Up to 1813, we have seen that the\r\nMilitary Academy was merely a small company of officers and cadets, who,\r\nbeing stationed at one post, were required while there to pursue certain\r\nmathematical and military studies. It had no one element of\r\norganization. From 1814 to 1817, professors Mansfield and Ellicott were\r\nstruggling with no more than partial success, to give it organization\r\nand systematic instruction. But, in 1817, Colonel Thayer, who had seen\r\nin France what such institutions required, and whose enlightened mind\r\nrealized the necessity of adopting better methods, at once coöperated\r\nwith the Professors, in making a permanent and successful reform.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: Captain Partridge, who was a useful and energetic\r\n    man, had subsequently full opportunity of carrying out his popular\r\n    views in the military schools of Norwich and Middletown, which he\r\n    founded by his own efforts.]\r\n\r\nAt this point we should notice the additions made to the academic staff,\r\nbetween 1816 and 1819, and the steps taken by the war department toward\r\ncarrying out the views of the Professors, and Colonel Thayer. CLAUDE\r\nCROZET was appointed professor of Engineering, in March, 1817; DAVID B.\r\nDOUGLAS was appointed assistant professor of Natural Philosophy, in\r\nJanuary, 1815; CHARLES DAVIES was appointed assistant professor of\r\nMathematics in December, 1816. Rev. THOMAS PICTON was appointed\r\nChaplain, and professor of Ethics, in July, 1818. THOMAS GIMBREDE was\r\nappointed teacher of Drawing, in January, 1819. Major JOHN BLISS,\r\ninstructor of Tactics, in April, 1818; Lieut. GEORGE W. GARDINER,\r\ninstructor of Artillery, in September, 1817. CLAUDIUS BERARD succeeded\r\nFrancis Masson, as teacher of French, in January, 1815; JOSEPH DU COMMUN\r\nwas appointed second teacher of French, in March, 1818. Of the old\r\nprofessors, Captain Partridge and Francis Masson were gone; all the\r\nothers remain. Thus, in 1817, when Colonel Thayer took charge of the\r\nAcademy, the corps of teachers was composed of professors Mansfield,\r\nEllicott, and Crozet; teachers Zoeller and Berard; and assistant\r\nprofessors Douglas and Davies, exclusive of the military teachers and of\r\nthose appointed in 1818 and 1819. This was properly the Academic Staff,\r\nand Colonel Thayer was willing and pleased to have them take their\r\nproper part in organizing the institution, and raising it to that high\r\nstandard of discipline and excellence to which it has since attained. In\r\nthe meanwhile, the war department, under the enlightened administration\r\nof Mr. Crawford, had endeavored to supply some of the obvious defects of\r\nthe Academy, by new regulations.\r\n\r\nSo far we have pursued the history of the Academy, as it progressed from\r\na germinal idea to actual being and life. It is now necessary to trace\r\nthat system of _scientific culture_ which is its essential element and\r\npeculiar character. In this the student of education may be more\r\ninterested, and as we trace it still further, in its _fruits_, the\r\neducation and services of more than two thousand young men, who have\r\nheld the most important positions in all the departments of life, we\r\nshall be better able to pronounce a just judgment upon its merits and\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nMr. CRAWFORD, one of the most enlightened men who have appeared in\r\npublic affairs, was, we believe, the first to understand and attempt to\r\nremedy the defects and irregularities which Professors Mansfield and\r\nEllicott had pointed out.[6] In March, 1816, “Rules and Regulations”\r\nwere drawn up by Mr. Crawford. The main points in them were--\r\n\r\n1. There shall be a Board of Visitors, to consist of five suitable\r\ngentlemen, who shall attend each annual examination.\r\n\r\n2. There shall be a General Examination twice in each year; in July and\r\nDecember, and an annual vacation in July and August.\r\n\r\n3. Cadets shall be admitted in September, and examined in spelling,\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic.\r\n\r\n4. A course of studies, embracing definitely all branches of science and\r\ninstruction to be procured, and rules for classification shall be drawn\r\nup, and comprise a complete course of education at the institution.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: These defects and irregularities arose from not\r\n    obeying the law, and not pursuing the ideas it pointed out. The\r\n    great effort of Professors Mansfield and Ellicott, was to get the\r\n    spirit of the law followed practically.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the last regulation, a course of studies was drawn up by\r\nthe Academic Faculty, and approved by Mr. Crawford, in July, 1816. This\r\ncourse comprised four years, and was substantially the same (although\r\nlargely increased,) which has been pursued since.\r\n\r\nThe _first year_ studies were English Grammar, French, Algebra,\r\nGeometry, and Logarithms.\r\n\r\nThe _second year_ comprised French, Geometrical Construction,\r\nApplication of Algebra, Mensuration, Plain and Spheric Trigonometry, the\r\nConic Sections, and Drawing.\r\n\r\nThe _third year_, Natural and Experimental Philosophy, Astronomy, and\r\nDrawing.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth year_, Engineering, Geography, History, and Ethics.\r\n\r\nIn the first draft, Engineering was put in the third year; but since\r\n1817, has been placed in the fourth. In a year or two afterwards was\r\nadded the Calculus; and in a few years, Chemistry, Mineralogy, and\r\nNatural Law. This course of studies is exclusive of the purely military\r\npart, which under the heads of Tactics, Practical Artillery and Gunnery,\r\noccupied several hours each day.\r\n\r\nThus, in July, 1816, the Academy had for the first time arrived at a\r\ncourse of studies, and a preparation for discipline. In the fall and\r\nwinter of 1816, began an attempt to carry this course of studies into\r\npractical effect. We do not say there had been no studies and no attempt\r\nat classification before that, for there were, but that nothing had\r\nreally been perfected in either, till after the “regulations” of 1816.\r\nIf we could carry the reader back to the year 1815, and see the\r\ndifficulties under which the professor of that day labored, the small\r\nmaterial provided, and the undisciplined condition of the young men\r\nunder their charge, we should give better views of the merits and\r\nservices of its pioneer teachers. One or two reminiscences may possibly\r\nthrow some light on the subject. Colonel Mansfield arrived at West Point\r\nin 1814, and immediately sought for his pupils. He was not like the\r\nprofessors of whom Gibbon speaks, remembering that he had a salary to\r\nreceive, but forgetting he had duties to perform. On the contrary, he\r\nimmediately asked for pupils to teach. What was he to teach? Philosophy\r\nand Astronomy. But these required prior training, and it was not till\r\nthe winter of 1814-’15, that he could find any pupils. Then he found\r\n_five_ young men who thought that they could go on in such studies. For\r\nwant of any recitation rooms at the Point, he taught them in the parlor\r\nof his own house. As we shall refer specifically to the subject of\r\ntext-books, we merely add, that the only work to be found at all\r\nsuitable, was _Enfield’s Philosophy_. There was no classification, and\r\nin a few months these five cadets were commissioned. They made the first\r\nclass in Philosophy, taught at West Point.\r\n\r\nAgain, there are some who will recollect Professor Ellicott, sitting at\r\nhis desk at the end of a long room, in the second story of what was\r\ncalled the Mess Hall, teaching Geometry or Algebra, looking and acting\r\nprecisely like the old-fashioned schoolmaster, of whom it was written,\r\n\r\n  “And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew,\r\n  That one small head could carry all he knew.”\r\n\r\nThe cadets were all “boys” to him, and his kind face was long\r\nremembered. In the other end of this room, or in the next, was seen his\r\nacting assistant, Stephen H. Long, then a young lieutenant of engineers;\r\nsince distinguished as a traveler, an engineer, and a man of science.\r\nThe text-book used was “Hutton’s Mathematics,” and at that time the best\r\nto be had. Mr. Hutton had been a professor at Woolwich, England, and his\r\ntreatises were plain, simple, easily understood, and therefore well\r\nadapted to beginners. It was, however, very deficient both in extent and\r\nanalysis. It was a good text-book then, for there were no cadets trained\r\nto pursue deeper or more analytical works. With Hutton’s Mathematics,\r\nEnfield’s Philosophy, and plain right-lined drawing, and nothing which\r\ncould be called engineering, did the cadets of the Academy get along,\r\nwithout roll, classification, or graduation, till the close of 1816.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1817, as we have said, Colonel Thayer became superintendent\r\nat West Point; and in the course of the next four or five years the\r\nAcademy passed through the great changes which brought it from the\r\ninchoate to the crystallized state in which it now appears. The most\r\nimportant of these changes relate to scientific culture; and we shall\r\nbest describe them by narrating the _actual work_ the classes then\r\npursued, and the change of text-books. The first step was taken, as we\r\nhave seen, in March, 1816, by the regulations of Mr. Crawford, which\r\nrequired classification, a course of studies, and annual examinations.\r\nSome steps towards these were taken in 1816, but very imperfectly. In\r\n1817 the system of classification was first systematically begun. CLAUDE\r\nCROZET, a French officer under Napoleon, and a pupil of the Polytechnic\r\nSchool, was appointed professor of engineering, in March, 1817. The\r\nannual examination coming on in June, the course of studies in his\r\ndepartment did not regularly commence till September, and the second or\r\njunior class[7] of 1817-’18 was the _first_ class which commenced\r\nthoroughly the severe and complete course of studies at West Point. The\r\n_labors_ of that class in the years 1818 and 1819 may have been equaled,\r\nbut certainly have not been surpassed. It was not a brilliant class, but\r\nits labors were not the less on that account. It had not merely to pass\r\nover the plain turnpike road of science which is now made so easy to\r\nthose who follow; but, like the pioneers of an army, had to cut down the\r\nobstructions, make their own bridges, and to no small extent, furnish\r\ntheir own munitions. Let us look into the class-room of 1817, as\r\nProfessor Crozet advances to instruct those young men in studies, which\r\nwere not only new to them, but entirely unheard of, and in which the\r\nlanguage to which they were born and bred _furnished not a single\r\ntext-book_. Professor Crozet was to teach engineering; but when he met\r\nthe class, he found not one of them fit to learn engineering. These were\r\nbranches of science, and its affiliations, essentially necessary to\r\nengineering, which they had never been taught. What was he to do? All he\r\ncould do obviously was to supply these preliminary studies before he\r\ncould commence in his own department. In other words, he must begin by\r\nbecoming a teacher of mathematics, and drawing. The surprise of the\r\nFrench engineer instructed in the Polytechnique may well be imagined\r\nwhen he commenced giving his class certain problems and instructions,\r\nwhich not one of them could comprehend or perform. Among these\r\npreliminary studies was Descriptive Geometry, not an original and\r\ndistinct science, but which by _projecting_ geometrical figures and\r\nproblems on co-ordinate planes, gave a more facile and practical mode of\r\n_representing_ (as its name implies,) as well as solving many\r\ngeometrical and practical problems. This, too, required an accurate\r\nknowledge of mathematical and perspective drawing, and its various minor\r\nbut important arts. We doubt whether at that time more than a dozen or\r\ntwo professors of science in this country knew there was such a thing;\r\n_certainly_ they never taught it, and equally certain, there was not a\r\ntext-book in the English language. Perhaps this is not surprising, when\r\nwe reflect, that this new application of geometry was scarcely thirty\r\nyears old. Monge, a French savans, was, we believe, the author of this\r\nsystem, about the beginning of the French Revolution. Crozet meant to\r\nbegin with Descriptive Geometry, but fortunately, the class was not in\r\nthe last year of the course (in which engineering has recently been\r\ntaught,) and could spare some time for mere mathematics. But, a new\r\ndifficulty arose. There was no text-book in English, and none to be had\r\njust then in French. Geometry is not a thing to be taught orally. What\r\nis to be done? It was here at this precise time that Crozet, by aid of\r\nthe carpenter and painter, introduced the _blackboard_ and chalk. It is\r\na very simple thing, and so is every thing which is useful; but we know\r\nof no mere adjunct of teaching, so useful as the blackboard. To\r\nprofessor Crozet, so far as we know, is due the introduction of this\r\nsimple and useful machine. He found it, with many other things, far\r\nsuperior to the English methods in the Polytechnic of France.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: The Class here spoken of graduated in 1819. Of its\r\n    living members, are HENRY BREWERTON, late Superintendent at West\r\n    Point; EDWARD D. MANSFIELD, Commissioner of Statistics for the\r\n    State of Ohio; JUSTIN DIMMICK, late Commander of Fortress Monroe;\r\n    DANIEL TYLER, a distinguished Engineer and General in the Army of\r\n    the Potomac; WM. H. SWIFT, a distinguished Engineer, and President\r\n    of the Illinois Canal Company; JOSHUA BAKER, a Civil Engineer,\r\n    Judge, and Planter, in Louisiana; and Major TURNBULL,\r\n    distinguished as a Topographical Engineer in the War with Mexico.\r\n\r\n    Among the dead was GEORGE H. WHISTLER, the most distinguished\r\n    Civil Engineer our country has produced.]\r\n\r\nWe now see Crozet with his blackboard before him, chalk in hand, and\r\nanimated, intellectual face, about to teach his class a new science,\r\nwithout a text-book. Again he meets a new difficulty. He does not more\r\nthan half understand the American language. This difficulty is only to\r\nbe overcome by practice. With extreme difficulty he makes himself\r\nunderstood. With extreme difficulty his class comprehend that two planes\r\nat right-angles with one another are to be understood on the same\r\nsurface of the blackboard on which are represented two different\r\nprojections of the same object. But, at last it is done. The Professor\r\nlabors with inexhaustible patience, and the pupils are pleased to\r\nreceive into their minds entirely new ideas. The first problems are\r\ndrawn and demonstrated on the blackboard, by the Professor; then drawn\r\nand demonstrated by the pupils, and then accurately copied into\r\npermanent drawings; and thus this class were taught in the most\r\nimportant and valuable method of imparting true knowledge, which has\r\nbeen given to mankind since the days of Socrates. Fortunately, professor\r\nCrozet had brought with him the complete drawings of the French\r\nPolytechnique, so that he was not, in this particular, obliged to depend\r\nupon himself. The path of his instruction soon became easier, and then\r\nthis class completed their course in drawing, mathematics, and\r\nEngineering.\r\n\r\nIn the study of Natural Philosophy and Mechanics, the way was scarcely\r\nless difficult. We have already said, that Enfield’s Philosophy was the\r\nfirst book on that subject. But this was not enough. Professor Mansfield\r\nlooked around in vain for any suitable book on Mechanics. At last,\r\n_Gregory’s Mechanics_ was adopted. It was a book without any analysis,\r\nand probably written only for scientific men. Yet, it was the best to be\r\nhad. For several years after, this work still remained the best book on\r\nMechanics. Whether the class who first studied its mysterious pages\r\nacquired as clear and extensive ideas of the subject as those who have\r\nsince passed over smoother roads, may be doubtful. It is certain they\r\nhad more arduous labors. We have said there was _no_ text-book on\r\nengineering, as a science. When the class which had commenced\r\nDescriptive Geometry, with professor Crozet, (then the second or the\r\njunior class,) had become the first class, they were instructed in\r\nengineering by drawings from oral teaching, on the blackboard. The\r\nvarious modes of laying out fortifications, of bridging, of defiling, of\r\nmaterials, ordnance, &c., were taught by professor Crozet. For several\r\nyears no text-book in engineering was found. It was not till 1823 that a\r\nFrench treatise, entitled the Science of War and Fortication, was\r\ntranslated by Major O’Connor, and for several years used as a text-book.\r\nIt will be seen that the class which, in 1817, 1818, and 1819, commenced\r\nthe new culture and discipline of West Point, had an arduous and\r\ndifficult task. It is, notwithstanding, quite probable, that this severe\r\nexercise of the mind, in making paths for itself, where there are no\r\nguide-posts on the way, no regal road, is a better discipline than that\r\nfurnished by the more easy and systematic methods.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no one step taken at West Point, has contributed so much to\r\nintellectual culture as the Merit-Roll. The effect at the Military\r\nAcademy is totally different from what it would be at any civil\r\ninstitution. For there it determines _rank_, which is the great object\r\nof military men. Forty young men may be commissioned on the same day to\r\nthe same grade, but through all their after life, even when they return\r\nto civil life, the distinctions of the merit-roll will follow them, and\r\nbe counted for or against them. In the very first day of their\r\ncommissioned service, the distinction is a practical one, for there are\r\ngreat and practical advantages in certain _arms_ of the service over\r\nothers. Thus the engineer officer, without any actual care of men, or\r\nresponsibility for any movements, and almost always stationed at\r\ncomfortable posts, has great advantages over other arms. The Artillery\r\nhas advantages over the Infantry. Thus the cadet, commissioned from West\r\nPoint, has determined for himself, by his position on the merit-roll,\r\nnot only his rank in the army, but almost his position in human life.\r\nThe merit-roll, as it now exists, graduated in all departments, and\r\nsummed up at the close of the course, was not adopted at once, but was\r\nthe work of several years.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1818, the superintendent of the Academy was directed by the\r\nSecretary at War to publish in the Army Register the “names of cadets\r\nwho are distinguished for attainments, and meritorious conduct, not\r\nexceeding five in each class, specifying the studies in which they may\r\nexcel.”\r\n\r\nWe well recollect with what excitement and interest this communication\r\nwas received by the cadets of that day, especially by those who thought\r\nthemselves within the probabilities of that distinction. It\r\nunquestionably stimulated most of the young men to much greater\r\nexertions than they would otherwise have made. In a few months after,\r\nthe merit-roll was fully established in the classes, and the rank of the\r\ngraduating cadets determined by it.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion, and no small doubt, as to the real\r\neffects of emulation. There is undoubtedly a bad sense, and a bad effect\r\nattached to that term. But is that a necessary consequence of the\r\nmerit-roll? Is not the merit-roll adopted, so far as it can be\r\nascertained, in all departments of human life? Who would risk himself\r\nwith an ignorant engineer, if he could get a skilled one? Who would\r\nemploy a poor clerk if he could get a good one? The objection made to\r\nemulation is that it excites wrong motives. However this may be, and\r\nhowever casuists may regard it, it is quite certain that the merit-roll\r\nis the strongest stimulant to intellectual exertion which can be\r\npresented to young men. Nor can we perceive, after much observation on\r\nits effect, that it has impaired the purely moral motives of action, or\r\nexcited evil passions, to be remembered in after life. At West Point all\r\nthe moral actions which are visible and tangible are brought within the\r\nscale of the merit-roll, and often the fate of a young man is determined\r\nfar more by his standing in conduct, than in studies.\r\n\r\nII. STUDY, DISCIPLINE, AND FRUITS.\r\n\r\nHaving thus sketched the historical progress of the Academy in the path\r\nof scientific culture, it remains for us to state what it _is_; what it\r\nhas _done_; and what men have _conducted_ it.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into minute details, we shall very briefly state the\r\npresent methods of study and discipline. The leading studies in their\r\norder are Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Mechanics, Astronomy,\r\nEngineering, Chemistry, French, Tactics, Artillery Practice, Mineralogy,\r\nEthics, and History. This course is wholly scientific, the practical\r\npart being adapted strictly to military purposes. In the early period of\r\nthe institution, some attempt was made to introduce the classics, but it\r\nwas found impracticable, with the limited time allowed the cadets.\r\nIndeed, it may be doubted whether any institution can have more than one\r\n_tone_. All branches of human learning may be embraced in the proper\r\nschedule of university instruction; but has any university given equal\r\nattention to all branches of education? What are called colleges in our\r\ncountry, all aim at fitting young men for the civil professions--Law,\r\nMedicine, and Theology. They therefore make the classics the principal\r\nbranch of study, and are right, since Law, Medicine, and Theology have\r\ntheir foundation deep laid in the classic ages. Literature also is a\r\npart of professional knowledge, necessary to adorn and illustrate the\r\nhistory and theory of professional science. Hence, in these lines of\r\ninstruction specially have run the studies of the college, and from\r\nthese is derived the _tone_ of college education. The object of the\r\nMilitary Academy was totally different. It was not civil, but martial\r\nlife, for which the young men were fitting. It was neither a\r\nmetaphysical discussion, nor a hair-splitting argument on the law, in\r\nwhich they were expected to excel. They were to learn the sterner\r\narguments of the battle-field; to arrange squadrons for the hardy fight;\r\nto acquire that profound knowledge of the science and materials of\r\nnature, which should fit them for the complicated art of war; to defend\r\nand attack cities; to bridge rivers; to make roads; to provide\r\narmaments; to arrange munitions; to understand the topography of\r\ncountries; and to foresee and provide all the resources necessary to\r\nnational defense. This was the object of the Military Academy, and to\r\nthat one end it was adapted. The method of education may be happily\r\nstated under the heads of Studies, Physical and Moral Discipline, and of\r\nMilitary Exercises.\r\n\r\n1. The subjects and method of study we have already mentioned;\r\nMathematical, Philosophical, Mechanical, Chemical, Military, and French,\r\nthe military language. These being the chief topics of study, the\r\nstudents and the time were suitably divided into classes and hours.\r\nThere are four classes, occupying four years, as usual in colleges.\r\nThere are ten months of study, the intermission being in the hot months\r\nof July and August, when only military studies and exercises are\r\npursued. The studies of a day are necessarily modified, by the\r\nintroduction of military exercises which consume much time. The regular\r\n_study hours_ (which include also the recitations,) are from 8 A.M. to 1\r\nP.M., and from 2 P.M. to 4 P.M., making _seven hours_ of study and\r\nrecitations. Generally _four hours_ more are consumed in military\r\nexercise and discipline, being the hours before breakfast, and after 4\r\nP.M. Thus _eleven_ hours are generally occupied either in study or\r\nexercises. The evening also after dark, is devoted to study in so far\r\nthat with occasional exceptions, the cadets are required to be in the\r\nrooms. In this division of time we find a _continual alternation of\r\nstudy and exercise_; leaving the least possible time for idleness, or\r\nmere amusement. Indeed, the problem of education is to find the _maximum\r\nof development_, with the _minimum of idleness_. To this should be\r\nadded, that the development should be co-relatively, intellectual,\r\nphysical, and moral.[8] It is not merely ignorance, but _unequal_\r\ndevelopment, which is the great misfortune of mankind. How many great\r\nand glorious intellects have been lost, because there were no\r\ncounter-balances to the force which, inclined in only one direction,\r\ncarried them off into a wilderness of fruitless objects!\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: We use the word _moral_, in preference to spiritual,\r\n    because, in its comprehensive sense, including the latter; but by\r\n    no means intimating, that in this Christian country, we should\r\n    make any place of education a mere reproduction of Persian or\r\n    Greek models. Our servile imitation of the Ancients, often makes\r\n    us forget that we are neither Spartans nor Romans. The man who\r\n    attempts at this day to revive the institutions of Pagan Greece,\r\n    is as false to true Philosophy, as he is to true Christianity.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of studies pursued at West Point, the main feature is the\r\n_method_ of study. We can give an idea of this in a few words. The very\r\nfirst thing done at West Point is to _recognize_ the fact, that\r\n_intellects are unequal_; in other words, that of a given number of\r\nyoung men, commencing a severe and elaborate course of studies, there\r\nwill be some who can not endure it, and can not get through; and others,\r\nwho while they will come up to the requisites for graduation, can not\r\nequal a third class, who are capable and ambitious of receiving the\r\nhighest style of education. This recognition is effected thus: a class\r\nenters the Academy, we will say _eighty_ in number. This class enters on\r\nthe 1st of September; and on the 1st of January there is a semi-annual\r\nexamination. This four months of study by that class is regarded as a\r\nperiod of _probation_, which will furnish some test of the abilities of\r\nits several members. When the January examination is held, some are\r\nfound deficient, and they are at once discarded. Then the remaining\r\nclass are numbered, according to what is then their _apparent_ merit,\r\nand they are divided into _sections_ of from fifteen to twenty each;\r\nthose highest on the roll being placed in the first section; those next\r\nin the second, &c. Usually there are four of these sections. The\r\nprofessor usually teaches the first section; his assistant the second,\r\nand so on. It is obviously a decided advantage to be in the first\r\nsection, and there is usually a struggle to get there. But, a cadet may\r\nchange his position in his class, at any time, by his own efforts. This\r\nhe can only do, however, by more strenuous efforts. Then, if he be in\r\nthe second section, he may at the end of the year be found to have a\r\nhigher aggregate of good marks in study and conduct than some of those\r\nin the first section. In that case he will be transferred. Thus the\r\nambition of the student has always placed before it the possibility of\r\nhigher class rank, and if his talents and industry are capable of it, he\r\nwill attain it.\r\n\r\nThe _method_ of study at West Point, which in all institutions is the\r\nimportant point, is the _rigidly demonstrative_, in those studies which\r\nadmit of it, and the _positively practical_ in those which do not. The\r\ncourse of studies requires this, if the subjects of study are to be\r\nthoroughly understood. There is little of the purely metaphysical or\r\ntranscendental known or pursued at West Point. No abstract speculations\r\nor merely theoretical inquiries occupy their minds. It is the actually\r\nknowing, and doing, in which they are engaged. As far as can be made\r\npractically useful, the _oral_ method is pursued. In mathematical and\r\nmechanical, engineering and tactical studies, this is largely the case.\r\nThe blackboard, we have said, was first introduced into this country by\r\nProfessor Crozet, at West Point. How largely this is used in all\r\ninstitutions of education now, our readers well know. It has proved one\r\nof the most efficient means of instruction at West Point. The student of\r\nthe mathematical section, for example, begins with a text-book on\r\nAlgebra, in his hand; but, it is on the blackboard where the workings of\r\nhis mind are chiefly exhibited. He learns what he can from the book,\r\nbut, on the blackboard the professor makes him trace out what he has\r\ndone, not merely by telling what he knows, but what he don’t know;\r\ndetects his weak place, and forces his mind (so far as such force is\r\npossible,) to _think_, and think rightly on the subject before him. This\r\n_thinking_, we need not tell experienced teachers, is the great thing\r\nwhich education is to teach. If a student can not, or will not think\r\nstudiously and industriously, he will not long remain at West Point.\r\nThere is not, as in civil colleges, the great fallow field of poetry,\r\nhistory, and metaphysics, in which he may show his classical professor\r\nthat he has acquired rich things, although ignorant of mathematics. It\r\nwill not do to say that he has wandered with Greeks and Romans around\r\nthe ruins of Troy, or by the waters of Babel. There is no such\r\ncompensating principle in the system at West Point. The cadet must study\r\nwhat is set before him; must study it hard; must think upon it, and\r\ndiscipline his mind to systematic modes of thought.\r\n\r\n2. This leads us to the Specific Discipline of the Academy. This is\r\npartially included in what we have already said. The intellectual\r\ndiscipline is mainly maintained by the method of study; but there is a\r\ngrand and perfect system of discipline, which we may briefly describe.\r\nThe term DISCIPLINE is derived from disciples, _discipulus_, and means\r\noriginally _teaching_ of knowledge; but this is not all, nor entirely\r\nits modern sense. Discipline is _training_ in knowledge and virtue, in\r\norder and diligence, in good conduct, and good habits. To do this\r\nrequires a control of the body as well as mind; of food and raiment; of\r\ntime and exercise; as well as the imparting of facts and ideas. It was\r\nin the former sense rather than of the latter, that the word EDUCATION,\r\n(to lead forth,) was understood among the ancients, and so far as they\r\nwent they were right. It was this _discipline_ in virtue, temperance,\r\ncourage, fortitude, and self-denial, which was taught in the days of\r\nPersian Cyrus, and Greek Leonidas. It was adopted among the early\r\nChristians; but, Cowper well said:--\r\n\r\n  “In colleges and halls in ancient days,\r\n  When learning, virtue, piety, and truth\r\n  Were precious, and inculcated with care,\r\n  There dwelt a sage called Discipline.\r\n     *   *   *   *   *\r\n  But Discipline, a faithful servant long,\r\n  Declin’d at length into the vale of years,”\r\n\r\nNothing can be more certain than the decline of “discipline” in modern\r\ncivil institutions. “Colleges and Halls” advertise a much enlarged\r\ncourse of studies; they call to their aid the most learned professors;\r\nand they proclaim “all the modern improvement,” and yet it is quite\r\ncertain, that a pupil can walk for years their learned halls, and at\r\nlast receive the honors of graduation with a very small share of either\r\nlearning, diligence, or virtue. Civil institutions may be most excellent\r\nfor all, who either by early care or natural inclination are willing to\r\nuse their opportunities for their intellectual or moral advancement.\r\nNay, more, all open irregularities will be corrected, and all possible\r\nmeans afforded for spiritual improvement. But there are two things\r\nimpossible to overcome--the popular and almost universal license allowed\r\nyouth, (under the name of freedom) and the total want of any ultimate\r\npower to restrain it. These stand directly in the way of thorough\r\ndiscipline. At a Government Military Institution, this is directly\r\nreversed. The very first thing taught is _positive obedience_. The cadet\r\ncan not be a week at West Point without knowing that he can not govern\r\nhimself, but must be governed by others. If he is either not fit or not\r\nwilling, the faculty meet the case in short and decisive language: “If\r\nyou are either unable or unwilling to pursue the course of study and\r\ndiscipline, we direct you must instantly go. There are plenty more\r\nworthy to fill your place.” There is, then, no alternative for the cadet\r\nbut to go forward, and exert himself to the utmost, or not to go at all.\r\nThere can be no loitering by the way, to slumber in idleness, or waste\r\nin dissipation, or pursue the pleasures of literature. There is no doubt\r\nthat this stern and constant discipline is the great merit of West\r\nPoint. It acts on the whole conduct and character. We have already said,\r\nthat the class-standing determined by the merit-roll, determined their\r\nposition relatively, and their rank in the army, and by consequence,\r\ngreat distinctions and differences in after life.\r\n\r\nLet us see how this merit-roll is made up. The _first_ thing done is to\r\n_mark_ each cadet with a _figure_ (having relation to an agreed scale of\r\nnumbers,) for every act done or undone, in study, conduct, drill,\r\nattention, &c. The _second_ is to agree upon the _relative values_ of\r\neach study, conduct, &c., in aggregating the whole positive or negative\r\nperformance of a cadet, in his whole course at West Point. The summation\r\nof these for any one year gives his class-standing for that year, and\r\nthe summation for the whole course gives his standing at the time of\r\ngraduation, and his rank in the army.\r\n\r\nFormerly, and we believe yet, the mode of marking and summing up for\r\nstanding, was this. Each professor or teacher marked for one performance\r\none of seven marks, from -3 to +3. This being purely artificial may be\r\nchanged. But it is in this way the marking is made. Then in regard to\r\n_relative values_ of study and conduct, the scale formerly was:--\r\n\r\n  Mathematics,                           300.\r\n  Philosophy and Mechanics,              300.\r\n  Engineering and Military Science,      300.\r\n  Chemistry and Mineralogy,              200.\r\n  Moral and Political Philosophy,        200.\r\n  Conduct,                               300.\r\n  Infantry Tactics,                      150.\r\n  Artillery Practice,                    150.\r\n  French,                                100.\r\n  Drawing,                               100.\r\n\r\nTo obtain 2,100, the aggregate, a cadet must never have failed in a\r\nrecitation, or been absent from a military duty, or derelict in the\r\nleast particular. This most rarely if ever happens. Not to fall short\r\nmore than 100, is evidence of very high standing.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, that under this system, emulation is highly excited, and,\r\nin fact, there must be a constant, unremitting effort to graduate at\r\nall. The general result is, that not more than one-half of all appointed\r\nare graduates. At the first semi-annual examination, many drop off;\r\nseveral more at the end of the first year, and more at the end of the\r\nsecond. Nearly all who survive the second year are graduated.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining point, peculiar to the system at West Point, is that\r\nof Military Exercises. As a Military Institution, this is a necessity,\r\nbut it has also a great advantage as a means of Physical Education. This\r\nis a kind of education too much neglected, and for which civil colleges\r\nafford little opportunity, and no encouragement. The ordinary games,\r\namusements, and walks in the field are relied upon to afford development\r\nto the body, and the natural tastes the only guide. So thought not\r\nPersian statesmen, Greek Philosopher, or Roman Senator. In contrast, a\r\nsystematic education of the body was a principle, and a practice, with\r\nall the civilized nations of antiquity. There was a constant attention\r\nto this in the training of youth; and the Olympian Games, the Gymnastic\r\nExercises, and the Gladiatorial Shows, all had reference to this\r\nprinciple. If heathen nations could thus wisely attend to the healthy\r\ndevelopment of their bodies, can Christian people safely neglect it?\r\nThere is no question that the Christian law of temperance, daily labor,\r\ngood temper and amiable dispositions will do much to preserve health and\r\nstrength. The health of the mind goes far to make the health of the\r\nbody; but we must recollect that all students, properly so called--men\r\nwho are set apart for the cultivation of learning and science--the\r\n_savans_ of a country, are cut off at the very beginning, from that\r\n_daily labor_ of the body, which in the dawn of human history was\r\ndeclared to be the necessity of man’s existence. There is, therefore, a\r\npositive need of supplying by some system of salutary exercises, the\r\nplace of that labor in which the farmer and mechanic are constantly\r\nexercised. What shall it be? Our common classical institutions have left\r\nthis almost entirely to the student’s own choice. Several hours of the\r\nday are left to the student to employ as he pleases. Does not experience\r\nprove, that he is quite as apt to employ this in novel reading, or\r\nplaying cards, or visiting, or (in the case of an ambitious pupil,) in\r\nstudying or reading the classics, as in any systematic method of\r\nexercise? Let the early dead of consumption, the victims of dissipation,\r\nand the unhappy subjects of chronic diseases, teach the living, that\r\neducation consists not merely in spurring the mind on to intellectual\r\nfeats, however admirable. The bird soars through the mid-heavens, but\r\nsoars on the strength of his wings; and if he had the soul of Socrates,\r\nwould still fall, when they are exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe military exercises, at West Point, accomplish some great results.\r\nThey give an admirable exercise to the body, and they occupy time which\r\nmight be wasted, and they compel the cadets to give up late night\r\nstudies. Let us begin with the last. Nothing is more common among the\r\nambitious students of colleges, than to sit up late at night. To burn\r\nthe midnight oil, in order to accompany every thought in the realms of\r\nPlato, or fight with Hector on the plains of Troy, or pursue the phantom\r\nof metaphysics, or the genius of literature through the bright worlds of\r\nfiction, is the common boast of scholars. They have little thought, till\r\ntoo late, that life was shortened, and happiness impaired, by every hour\r\ntaken from the natural period of rest. At West Point this evil is\r\navoided, not so much by force of command, as by that of wise\r\narrangements. At the dawn of day, even in the shortest days, the shrill\r\nfife and rolling drum summon the cadet to his morning duties, and with\r\nthe exception of the hours of meals, there is one incessant pressure\r\nupon him for bodily and intellectual labor, till ten at night. The\r\nresults of this is, that when the hour of retirement comes, he must have\r\nmore than human strength, who is not ready and willing to lie down and\r\nsleep. There are, of course, exceptions; but, at West Point, they are\r\nrare. The lights are put out at 10 o’clock, and the weary student is\r\nready to retire. Thus, the system of discipline at the Military Academy\r\nat once strengthens the body, stimulates ambition, prevents idleness,\r\nand compels the mind to pursue the objects of reason, rather than the\r\ncharms of imagination.\r\n\r\nHaving thus traced very briefly the history, studies, and discipline of\r\nWest Point, it is only just to say something upon the fruits it has\r\nproduced. These are divided naturally into two classes; the work of the\r\n_Professors_, and the performance of _Graduates_. The former is little\r\nnoticed in the accounts of our colleges, except in the reputation of\r\nsome distinguished men; but the latter, (the divines, lawyers, and\r\nstatesmen who have graduated,) make the glory and the ornament of the\r\ntriennial catalogue. Let us see if something has not been produced by\r\nWest Point, which, in regard to the peculiar objects and teaching of the\r\nAcademy, may bear a favorable comparison with the catalogue of any\r\ninstitution for the last half century. We do not mean in regard to the\r\nlearned professions, for if West Point had excelled in these\r\ndepartments, it would have utterly failed in those for which it was\r\nmade. But, we mean in the great field of science and of usefulness.\r\nFirst, let us look at some of the fruits produced by its professors,\r\nespecially in the production of _text-books_. In the history of\r\ninstruction at West Point, we have stated the total absence in the\r\nbeginning, of text-books on some subjects, and the unfitness of those on\r\nothers, even the common studies of Mathematics. The first text-book on\r\nDescriptive Geometry, published in America, and we believe, the English\r\nlanguage, was prepared by Professor CROZET; but, as he then understood\r\nour language imperfectly, and had little taste for authorship, it was\r\nsoon supplanted, by a complete treatise prepared by Professor Davies. On\r\nthat subject, as on the subject of Engineering, there was no systematic\r\ntreatise; and for a time, West Point got along by oral teaching, and\r\nsuch collateral aid as could be had. The utter deficiency of suitable\r\nbooks may be known by the fact, that the first really tolerable\r\ntext-books on mathematics were translations of La Croix, Bourdon, Biot,\r\n&c., French authors. The French methods of writing and teaching science\r\nare, on most topics, the best. Their style is clear and analytical. The\r\nEnglish treatises are clumsy, being what is called in literature,\r\nelliptical, having vacancies in the reasoning, to be supplied by the\r\nstudent. The next great and permanent improvement in books, were the\r\nmathematical works of Professor DAVIES, a graduate of 1815, when the\r\nAcademy was yet in a chrysalis state; he was several years a teacher\r\nbefore he conceived the idea of supplying a new series of mathematical\r\ntext-books. His first plan was to adopt the best French works as a\r\nbasis, and modify them, so as to be adapted to the American course of\r\ninstruction. In this manner were prepared “Davies’ Legendre,”\r\n(Geometry,) and subsequently “Davies’ Bourdon,” (Algebra.) Other\r\ntreatises were prepared on his own plan, and thus, for many years,\r\nProfessor Davies pursued the quiet and laborious task (independent of\r\nother avocations,) of preparing an entire course of mathematical\r\ntext-books. In time he modified these again, so as to fit them for the\r\nbest colleges, and the higher schools. From the smallest mental\r\narithmetic, to the profoundest treatise on the Calculus, he has produced\r\nclear and admirable text-books on every topic of mathematical studies.\r\nMany other good books have been prepared by professors in colleges, but\r\nthere is no part of the United States in which some one of Davies’ works\r\nis not taught in schools and colleges. Gradually, the civil institutions\r\nhave been, in some degree, brought up to the standard of West Point, in\r\nmathematical studies.\r\n\r\nIn more recent years, Professor BARTLETT has published his treatise on\r\nOptics; Professor CHURCH, on the CALCULUS, and Professor MAHAN, on Field\r\nFortification, and a treatise on Civil Engineering. Various other works\r\non military subjects have been contributed to the stock of knowledge, by\r\ngraduates of the Academy.[9]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: The authorship of West Point has been quite\r\n    extensive: too much so to enumerate here. Among the works of its\r\n    graduates, we may mention the “Political Manual,” “American\r\n    Education,” and Statistical Reports by Edward D. Mansfield, the\r\n    “Review of Edwards on the Will,” by A. T. Bledsoe, and the\r\n    Military Tactics of Generals McClellan, and Halleck. The\r\n    Educational Works of Mr. Mansfield have been before the public for\r\n    many years, and studied in all parts of the United States. In this\r\n    class also may be mentioned the editorial labors of some twenty of\r\n    the graduates, some of whom have had no small influence on public\r\n    affairs.]\r\n\r\nThus have the graduates of West Point, by disseminating in textbooks,\r\nand teaching the higher knowledge, and better methods pursued there, in\r\nfact, and beyond dispute, _elevated the entire standard of education in\r\nthis country_. Contrast, for example, the text-books of Day, Hutton,\r\nEnfield, Gregory, &c., which were the only ones to be had on\r\nmathematical science in 1818, with those now in use at West Point, New\r\nHaven, or Princeton. Contrast the methods of study before the\r\nblackboard, the art of drawing, the system of rigid demonstration, and\r\nof exact scales of merit were introduced, with those now in use in the\r\nhigher schools of science, and we shall be satisfied that West Point has\r\ndone a great and most useful work in elevating the standard of\r\neducation. This is one fruit of its production, which has been\r\naltogether too lightly estimated. If it be of importance to increase the\r\nnumber of blades of grass, it is of much more importance to increase the\r\nnumber of minds fitted to enjoy the works of God, and use beneficially\r\nthe gifts with which he has intrusted them.\r\n\r\nA more obvious and commonly remarked fruit of West Point, is the _men_,\r\nlaboring in their vocations, which it has produced. It is impossible\r\nhere, (though it would be a labor of love,) to note the individual\r\nexamples of merit and usefulness, among those whom West Point has sent\r\ninto the service of their country. We are here limited rather to a\r\nstatement of general results. It may be done briefly; and since we have\r\nseen no Register later than 1850, we must deal in round numbers. These,\r\nhowever, will approximate the precise facts. They are there\r\nstatistically:--\r\n\r\n  Whole number of Graduates, (about)                    2,000.\r\n  Killed in battle,                                        80.\r\n  Died in service,                                        300.\r\n  In military service of the United States now,           800.\r\n  Have been in political service (ministers,     }\r\n    governors,) mayors, and members of congress, }         80.\r\n    and of legislature                           }\r\n  Other civil and state offices,                          100.\r\n  Lawyers,                                                110.\r\n  Clergymen, (including two bishops,)                      16.\r\n  Physicians,                                             110.\r\n  President of colleges, professors and teachers,         100.\r\n  Authors, editors, and artists,                           25.\r\n  Civil engineers, and officers of R.R. and canals,       180.\r\n  Merchants, financiers, farmers, and manufacturers,      140.\r\n  Officers of militia, and volunteers, (not of the\r\n    army,)                                                110.\r\n\r\nNumbers have resigned, and died young, not above enumerated, and numbers\r\nof these also have died in the civil service. We have made this\r\nclassification to show how largely West Point has contributed to\r\neducation, civil engineering, and the professions. These were not the\r\ndirect objects of the Academy; but, when long years of peace presented\r\nno duties but that of the garrison, and no glory to the profession of\r\narms, it was natural and proper for active and ambitious young men to\r\nseek honor and usefulness in other pursuits. Nor did the government\r\ndiscourage this, for it foresaw what has happened, that these young men,\r\nso highly educated in science, would diffuse this knowledge throughout\r\nthe country; elevate the standard of education, and be ready when their\r\ncountry needed their services. This has happened. A better knowledge of\r\nthe exact sciences has been carried into the colleges; the railroads and\r\ncanals have been built by engineers ready furnished by the government;\r\nand now when half a million of men have been suddenly called to war,\r\nthey have been largely officered by the graduates of West Point. Here we\r\nmay briefly allude to the most grave fact which has been urged against\r\nthe Military Academy. The best officers of the rebel army were educated\r\nthere. Why is this? Is there a want of sound morals? or, is loyalty no\r\nvirtue there? Neither. A part, and _a part only_[10] of the graduates\r\nborn and grown up in the south, have gone with their friends, families,\r\nand connections, into the rebel service. This was on account of social\r\nties, and had no more to do with West Point, than had other rebels from\r\nHarvard, or Yale, with those institutions. The noticeable fact is that\r\nthey were educated at the government expense, and therefore under\r\npeculiar obligations to the country. But we find a parallel in the\r\nnumerous officers of the state, as well as of the army and navy, who had\r\nbeen honored and rewarded at the public expense, but who thought it no\r\nshame to betray their country, and conspire against its life. We in vain\r\nattempt to account for such crimes, except upon the principle of common\r\ndepravity, of which history has furnished similar examples in all ages\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: We should not forget that a large number of West\r\n    Point graduates from the south, (Maryland, Virginia, Carolina, and\r\n    Tennessee,) have remained _loyal_, in spite of all the influences\r\n    of social and political ties.]\r\n\r\nWe have come to the end of the work we proposed. The rise, progress, and\r\nfruits of the Military Academy, we have briefly, and, we trust, justly\r\ndelineated. Certainly, we have no end to serve, no prejudice to gratify.\r\nWe knew the Academy in its early and immature period. We have seen it\r\ngrow up to usefulness and honor. We see its graduates taking their\r\nplaces among those who have well served their country, and well deserved\r\nits laurels. In this we are _glad_. But our memory is filled with other\r\nimages. We see West Point, in the now lengthening shadows of time. We\r\nseem to see those with whom we studied freshly present, as they walk the\r\ngreen plain, or sit before the class, or strive to teach our dull and\r\ninattentive minds. They were men worth remembering, and when, in after\r\ntimes, we became their friends, rather than their pupils, still more\r\npleasant memories gathered around them. We seem to see the venerable\r\nELLICOTT, like Goldsmith’s schoolmaster, alike full of learning, and of\r\nkindly humor; the placid and intellectual expression of MANSFIELD, whose\r\nabstracted looks seemed to be searching the higher philosophy; the\r\ncourtly and dignified THAYER, whose graceful manners and attractive\r\nconversation can not be forgotten by any who knew him; and the amiable\r\nCOURTNAY, who though of later date, will long be remembered. He left the\r\nworld in doubt, whether he was the better scholar or the better man.[11]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: Mr. Courtnay was afterwards Professor of Philosophy\r\n    and Mechanics in the University of Virginia. There he died,\r\n    lamented by all who knew him.]\r\n\r\nOf these, and of those like them, do we think, when we think of West\r\nPoint. Nor of those alone; the place itself, where nature delights in\r\nthe sublime and beautiful, rises before us. No imagination is necessary\r\nto clothe it with the hues of poetry; no books to recall the lost\r\npassages of history; no labored eulogy to bring up the memories of the\r\ndead. You can no more forget them, than you can the Pilgrims, when\r\nstanding by the rock of Plymouth. Yon gray and moss-covered ruin was\r\nonce the fortress of the Revolution. Yon scarcely perceptible pile of\r\nstones marks the spot where its soldiers were hutted in the winter. Yon\r\nslightly raised turf, beneath the dark shades of the cedar, was his\r\ngrave, and soon, perhaps even now, that slight memorial will be gone\r\nforever. Yon little valley under the shadows of the mountain, recalls\r\nthe illustrious name of Washington. Yon blue mountain-top tells of the\r\nbeacon fires he lit. All around are memories; all around are sacred\r\nspots. If the Greek remembers Marathon; if the Jew lingers at Jerusalem,\r\nor the Christian pilgrim grows warm at Bethlehem, so should the American\r\nremember West Point; linger round the ruins of Fort Put, and gaze with\r\ndelight on the blue summit of Beacon Hill.\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF INSTRUCTION AT WEST POINT.\r\n\r\n1. Down to 1802, the instruction of the Cadets attached to the Corps of\r\nArtillerists and Engineers stationed at West Point, according to Act of\r\nCongress (May 7th, which was all that repeated recommendations of\r\nWashington and other experienced officers could obtain), was confined to\r\nmilitary drill and practical exercises in common with other members of\r\nthe Corps; but as that Corps was made up of the scientific officers of\r\nthe army, and as military works were in construction under their plans\r\nand superintendence, these exercises were of great practical value, and\r\nthe appointment of these Cadets in 1794, and their gathering at West\r\nPoint, may be regarded as the nucleus of the Military Academy.\r\n\r\n2. The Military Academy, established with that name, by Act of March 16,\r\n1802, in pursuance of a Bill reported in 1800, by the Committee of\r\nDefense in the House of Representatives, of which Harrison Gray Otis was\r\nchairman, and to which an elaborate report of the Secretary of War\r\n(James McHenry, of Maryland), had been referred--consisted of the Corps\r\nof Engineers, which by the Act was organized distinct from that of\r\nArtillery, and could not exceed in officers and cadets, twenty members.\r\nThe Corps was stationed at West Point, and its officers and cadets were\r\nsubject to duty in such places as the President should direct. The\r\nprincipal engineer was made superintendent, and down to 1808 he was\r\ninstructor in fortifications, field-works, and the use of instruments.\r\nTwo officers of the rank of captain, appointed without previous military\r\nexperience, but with special reference to their knowledge of\r\nmathematics, gave instruction in that branch, “one in the line of\r\ngeometrical, and the other of algebraic demonstration.”\r\n\r\nIn 1803, two teacherships--one of the French language and the other of\r\nDrawing, was attached to the Corps of Engineers, and in 1804, F. De\r\nMasson was appointed to discharge the duties of both.\r\n\r\nIn 1808, the basis of the Military Academy, so far as related to the\r\nnumber of Cadets, was enlarged by the addition of two for each new\r\ncompany of Infantry, Riflemen, and Artillery, added to the military\r\nforce; and the number in the Act of 1812, is limited to 250, which with\r\nthe ten originally attached to the Corps of Engineers, fixed the\r\nstrength of the Cadets at 260.\r\n\r\nBy the Act of April 29, 1812, the Corps of Engineers was enlarged, and\r\nwas again constituted the Military Academy, and in addition to the\r\nteacher of the French language, and Drawing, provided in Act of Feb. 28,\r\n1803, one Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy; one\r\nProfessor of Mathematics; one Professor of Engineering in all its\r\nbranches; and for each an Assistant Professor taken from the most\r\nprominent characters of the officers or cadets, are provided for; and\r\nfor the purposes of military instruction, it is ordered that the\r\nstudents shall be arranged into companies and officered from their own\r\nmembers, to be taught all the duties of a private, non-commissioned\r\nofficer, and officer; and for instruction in all matters incident to a\r\nregular camp, shall go into camp for at least three months of each year,\r\nand erecting buildings and providing apparatus, library, and all\r\nnecessary implements, the sum of $25,000 is appropriated. By this act\r\nthe minimum of age is fixed at 14, and the literary qualifications of\r\ncandidates on entering are to be well versed in reading, writing, and\r\narithmetic.\r\n\r\nIII. CONDITION IN 1871.\r\n\r\nI. GOVERNMENT AND ORGANIZATION.[12]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: From Instructions for government of the U.S.\r\n    Military Academy, Report of Board of Visitors for 1871, and an\r\n    account by Col. McDougall in Report of English Military\r\n    Commission.]\r\n\r\nA military officer, not usually below the rank of colonel, is appointed\r\nby the President of the United States as _superintendent_ of the\r\nAcademy, who has supreme local control over both the studies and\r\ndiscipline of the institution. He renders all prescribed returns, and\r\naddresses his communications to the _inspector_.\r\n\r\nThe _inspector_ of the Academy is an officer of rank in the army named\r\nby the Secretary of War, who has his residence at Washington, and\r\nthrough whom all general orders relating to the Academy are transmitted\r\nto the superintendent at West Point. He makes an inspection of the\r\nAcademy at least once in each year.[13]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: The duties of Inspector are now (1871) discharged\r\n    directly by the Secretary.]\r\n\r\nThe general staff of the Academy consists of an adjutant, a\r\nquartermaster, a treasurer, one surgeon, and two assistant surgeons.\r\n\r\nAlthough the system of the Academy as regards the training of the cadets\r\nboth in and out of study is peculiarly and rigidly military, the staff\r\nof instruction is separate from the staff of discipline.\r\n\r\n_Military Staff._\r\n\r\nThe cadets are organized into a battalion of four companies.\r\n\r\nThe _commandant of cadets_, usually not under the rank of\r\nlieutenant-colonel in the army, exercises the immediate command of the\r\nbattalion. He is also, _ex officio_, principal instructor in infantry,\r\nartillery, and cavalry _tactics_ (signifying drill).\r\n\r\nUnder the commandant are six _assistant instructors of tactics_,\r\nviz.--one for artillery; two for infantry; one for cavalry; one for\r\nartillery and infantry; one for infantry and cavalry. The four senior of\r\nthese officers command the four cadet companies respectively; the two\r\njunior officers being always available to perform the routine duties of\r\nthe others in case of absence. The assistant instructors must be\r\nofficers of the army.\r\n\r\nThe battalion is provided with a full complement of _cadet_ officers,\r\nand non-commissioned officers, who are appointed by the superintendent\r\nfrom a list submitted by the commandant of cadets.\r\n\r\nTo each company are appointed\r\n\r\n  1 Captain,\r\n  3 Lieutenants,\r\n  1 First Sergeant,\r\n  3 Second Sergeants,\r\n  4 Corporals.\r\n\r\nThe battalion staff consists of\r\n\r\n  1 Adjutant,\r\n  1 Quartermaster,\r\n  1 Sergeant Major,\r\n  1 Quartermaster Sergeant.\r\n\r\nThe cadet companies are composed indiscriminately of the four classes\r\ninto which the students are divided according to their respective years\r\nof residence, the period of residence being four years for all.\r\n\r\nThe cadet officers are taken from the first, or senior class; the\r\nsergeants from the second class; the corporals from the third class. The\r\nselection is not made with special reference to proficiency in study.\r\nThose are selected who have manifested the greatest military aptitude\r\nand respect for discipline in their own conduct; although _cœteris\r\nparibus_ superior standing in study would be decisive.\r\n\r\n_Staff of Instruction_\r\n\r\nThe general superintendence of the studies is exercised by the\r\nsuperintendent, acting with the Academic Board. The immediate staff of\r\ninstruction is as follows:\r\n\r\n  { One professor,\r\n  { One assistant professor,\r\n  { Two acting assistant professors,\r\n    Military and civil engineering.\r\n\r\n  { One professor,\r\n  { One assistant professor,\r\n  { Two acting assistant professors,\r\n    Natural and experimental philosophy.\r\n\r\n  { One professor,\r\n  { One assistant professor,\r\n  { Five acting assistant professors,\r\n    Mathematics.\r\n\r\n  { One professor,\r\n  { One assistant professor,\r\n  { One acting assistant professor,\r\n    Drawing.\r\n\r\n  { One professor,\r\n  { One assistant professor,\r\n  { Three acting assistant professors,\r\n    French.\r\n\r\n  { One professor,\r\n  { One assistant professor,\r\n  { One acting assistant professor,\r\n    Spanish.\r\n\r\n  { One professor,\r\n  { One assistant professor,\r\n  { One acting assistant professor,\r\n    Ethics and Law.\r\n\r\n  { One professor,\r\n  { One assistant professor,\r\n  { Two acting assistant professors,\r\n    Chemistry, mineralogy, and geology.\r\n\r\n  { One instructor,\r\n  { One assistant instructor,\r\n    Ordnance and gunnery.\r\n\r\n  { One instructor,\r\n  { One assistant instructor,\r\n    Practical military engineering.\r\n    Military signals and telegraphing.\r\n\r\n  One sword master.\r\n\r\nThe Academic Board consists of the Superintendent, the Commandant of\r\nCadets, the Professors of the Academy, and the Instructors of Practical\r\nMilitary Engineering, and of Ordnance and Gunnery.\r\n\r\nAll the professors and instructors, with their assistants and acting\r\nassistants, have been educated at West Point, with exception of the\r\nchaplain, the professors of French and Spanish, and the sword master.\r\nAll are regularly enrolled in the military service of the United States,\r\nand subject to military discipline.\r\n\r\n_Professors and Assistants._\r\n\r\nThe professor or chief instructor in each branch is responsible for the\r\nefficiency and uniformity of the system of instruction in his own\r\ndepartment. To this end he has no special class or section assigned to\r\nhim for tuition. His time is devoted to general superintendence, and is\r\nchiefly spent in visiting the halls of study of his assistants. He does,\r\nhowever, take the instruction of the different sections, each in their\r\nturn, as he sees fit, and occasionally assembles all the sections of his\r\ndepartment for lecture.\r\n\r\nThe assistant and acting assistant professors or instructors are always\r\nappointed from among officers on the full pay of their regiments who\r\nhave graduated at the Academy, on the recommendation of the professor or\r\nchief instructor of the branch in which there is a vacancy to be filled.\r\nThese assistants are carefully selected through means of the data of\r\ntheir proficiency, temper, and general character, afforded by their\r\nrecord of four years’ residence as cadets. They are, thus, all of them\r\npreviously well known to the professors to whom they are to act as\r\nassistants, and to whom they are naturally inclined to defer from old\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nThe term of duty at the Academy of the assistant and acting assistant\r\nprofessors and instructors is fixed at four years, at the end of which\r\nperiod they return to regimental service. Duty at the Academy is\r\nobligatory on every officer who may be selected for it, and is\r\nconsidered as part of the general service which every officer who has\r\ngraduated at West Point, owes to the country; practically those only are\r\nselected to whom the duty is not disagreeable.\r\n\r\n_Admission_\r\n\r\nEach congressional or territorial district of the United States (_i.e._\r\neach district entitled to return a member to Congress), is by law\r\nentitled to have one cadet receiving education at the Academy.\r\n\r\nThe nominations are made in each year by the Secretary of War, on the\r\nrecommendation of the representatives in Congress of the several\r\ndistricts then unrepresented at the Academy, or whose representatives\r\nare about to quit the Academy. In addition to these, the President of\r\nthe United States may nominate ten cadets in each year, to be selected\r\naccording to his own will and pleasure, from the community at large.\r\n\r\nThe number of vacancies at West Point in any one year varies according\r\nto the number of cadets who happen to complete their period of\r\nresidence, and of those, who, not having completed their term, are yet\r\ndischarged as deficient in studies or discipline, as hereafter\r\nexplained. The number of yearly admissions varies from 50 to 70.\r\n\r\nThe date of admission in each year is the 1st of July, and the candidate\r\nfor admission is required to report in person to the superintendent\r\nbefore the 31st of May, with a view to his qualifications being tested.\r\nBut if sickness or any other unavoidable cause should interfere, he may\r\npresent himself on the 28th of August. Except at the two periods above\r\nnamed, no admissions can take place.\r\n\r\nCandidates must be over 17 and under 22 years of age, except in the case\r\nof any candidate who may have served faithfully as an officer or\r\nenlisted man in the army of the United States, either as a volunteer or\r\nin the regular service during the late civil war, who may be admitted up\r\nto 24 years of age.\r\n\r\nCandidates must be at least five feet in height; free from any\r\ndeformity, disease, or infirmity which would render them unfit for\r\nmilitary service; and from any disorders of an infectious or immoral\r\nnature. They must be able to read and write well, and be thoroughly\r\nversed in the first four rules of arithmetic, in reduction, in simple\r\nand compound proportion, and in vulgar and decimal fractions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the examination for entrance is not difficult, the prescribed\r\ntests, both medical and intellectual, are rigidly applied, and many\r\ncandidates are rejected.\r\n\r\nThe examination for entrance is not competitive, but simply a qualifying\r\nexamination. The competitive system commences after a cadet is once\r\nadmitted; it enters into every branch of instruction, and continues in\r\nfull force to the end of his residence.\r\n\r\n_Subjects and Course of Study._\r\n\r\nThe length of the course of study, for all who may succeed in\r\ngraduating, is four years; its nature, after the first year, is\r\nprincipally professional, and the course of study is identical for all\r\nthe students. The subjects are not all studied simultaneously, separate\r\nperiods of the course being devoted to certain subjects, as shown by the\r\ntime tables annexed.\r\n\r\nThe relative importance of the different subjects is indicated by the\r\nmaximum marks of merit assigned to them respectively, at the summing up\r\nof the results of each student’s attendance at the end of his fourth\r\nyear, according to the following scale:--\r\n\r\n  _Subjects._                     Maximum.  Period of Attendance.\r\n\r\n  Mathematics,                            300          2 years\r\n  Natural and experimental philosophy,    300          1 year.\r\n  Military and civil engineering,         300          1   “\r\n  Chemical physics and chemistry,         150          1   “\r\n  Ethics and law,                         150          1   “\r\n  French,                                 100          2 years.\r\n  Drawing,                                100          2   “\r\n  Spanish,                                 75          1 year.\r\n  Mineralogy and geology,                  75          1   “\r\n  Ordnance and gunnery,                    75          1   “\r\n  Infantry tactics (theory),               50          1   “\r\n  Artillery   “        “                   50          1   “\r\n  Cavalry     “        “                   50          1   “\r\n  Discipline,                             300\r\n                                        -----\r\n                General merit,          2,075\r\n\r\nPractical instruction in surveying; in fortification; in ordnance and\r\ngunnery, including the loading, pointing, and firing heavy guns; in\r\ndrill, or, as it is termed, the tactics of the three arms; in interior\r\neconomy and regimental duty; forms an important part of the training of\r\nthe cadet at different periods during his residence. In addition, the\r\nmonths of July and August in each year are entirely devoted to practical\r\ninstruction, the battalion being then placed under canvas and relieved\r\nfrom all study.\r\n\r\nDuring his first year a cadet receives instruction in fencing three\r\nhours in each week, from 10th October to 1st April.\r\n\r\nDuring his second year he receives instruction in riding three hours in\r\neach week, from 1st November to 15th March.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of his third academic year, from 1st October to 1st\r\nJuly, he receives instruction in riding, excepting between the 1st\r\nFebruary and 15th April.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of his fourth academic year he receives instruction\r\nin riding, three days in each week.\r\n\r\nSwimming is not taught at the Academy. There is a good gymnasium for the\r\nuse of the cadets in recreation hours, but the practice of gymnastics is\r\npurely voluntary.\r\n\r\n_Classification for Instruction._\r\n\r\nThe cadets are ranged in four distinct classes, corresponding with the\r\nfour years of residence. Cadets of the first year constitute the fourth\r\nclass; those of the second year, the third class; and so on. Cadets are\r\npromoted from one class to another at the end of the academic year, 30th\r\nJune; provided only that they shall have passed satisfactorily before\r\nthe Academic Board in the examinations which are always held during\r\nJune, failing in which, they are either kept back in their then class\r\nfor another year, or, in the case of decided deficiency, discharged from\r\nthe Academy.\r\n\r\nEach class is divided into sections convenient for instruction in the\r\ndifferent branches of study. The method of division will be best\r\nexplained by taking the fourth or lowest class as an example.\r\n\r\nThe members of the fourth class are, on their admission to the Academy,\r\narranged in alphabetical order, and are then formed into sections,\r\naveraging about 12 cadets for each branch of study. After the lapse of a\r\nmonth, transfers are made at the close of each week from one section to\r\nanother, according to the results of the past week’s attendance in\r\nstudy, and so continue until those most advanced are found in the first\r\nsection; the next in order, in the second section; and so on.\r\n\r\nDuring the first six months of residence, cadets are on probation, and\r\nonly receive their _warrant_ as cadets, provided they shall have passed\r\nsatisfactorily at the January examinations held before the Academic\r\nBoard, and that their conduct shall have been satisfactory.\r\n\r\nBefore receiving his _warrant_, each cadet is required to sign an\r\nengagement of service in the United States army for eight years, and to\r\ntake an oath of allegiance to the National Government and Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe hours allotted to study are divided nearly equally between\r\nattendance on the instructors in the halls of study--or _section rooms_,\r\nas they are termed--and independent study in quarters. The attendance in\r\nthe section rooms is termed _recitation_; the independent study in\r\nquarters, _study_.\r\n\r\nThe theory is, that during each recitation, every cadet of the section\r\nattending it, shall receive a thorough _viva voce_ examination\r\nillustrated on the blackboard, and there is not much practical variation\r\ntherefrom. Where there is any departure from it, it arises from the\r\nnumber of cadets in a section being too large to enable them all to be\r\nexamined during the same recitation, which lasts an hour and a half, or\r\nan hour, according to the subject. Recitations in mathematics, in\r\nnatural and experimental philosophy, and in civil and military\r\nengineering, occupy one hour and a half; in all the other branches of\r\ninstruction, only one hour. Thus, when it appears in the time table that\r\na class attends mathematics, for example, from 8 to 11, it is to be\r\nunderstood that the sections forming one half of the class attend their\r\nrespective teachers in the section rooms during an hour and a half,\r\nwhile the other half of the class is engaged in study in quarters. At\r\nthe end of the first hour and a half those sections which have attended\r\nrecitation return to their quarters to study, while their places are\r\ntaken by the remaining sections which have been up to that time engaged\r\nin study in quarters.\r\n\r\nEach teacher, as a general rule, has two sections specially assigned to\r\nhim for instruction, excepting the professor or head of each department\r\nwho, as has been already explained, devotes his time to general\r\nsuperintendence, and takes the different sections for his personal\r\ninstruction at such times and in such order as he may judge best.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the section rooms the different sections parade in\r\nthe barrack square by sound of bugle, under the superintendence of the\r\ncadet _officer of the day_; the roll is then called by the senior cadet,\r\nwho is termed the _section marcher_, who reports absentees to the\r\nofficer of the day, and marches his section off to the section room by\r\ndirection of the latter. Arrived in the section room, the section\r\nmarcher causes the cadets to take their seats in the order of their\r\nnames on the roll, and then hands them over to the instructor. When\r\ndismissed by the instructor, the section marcher forms his section as\r\nbefore, marches it back to the barrack square, reports all infractions\r\nof discipline which may have taken place either in study or on the march\r\nto the officer of the day, and then dismisses his section by the\r\nlatter’s permission.\r\n\r\nThere is no system of private tuition recognized at the Academy. Each\r\ncadet must depend on his own exertions, aided by the explanations given\r\nby the instructors in the section rooms, and by the occasional\r\nassistance he may derive from his more advanced comrades.\r\n\r\nThe allotment of so large a portion of time to independent study is a\r\ngreat departure from the practice of military schools in Europe; and it\r\nis a remarkable feature in the West Point system that no continued\r\nsupervision is exercised over the cadets when studying in quarters\r\nbeyond that which is supplied by the discipline of the cadets\r\nthemselves. The senior of the two cadets inhabiting each room is\r\nresponsible for discipline and orderly behavior. The officer of the day\r\n(cadet) visits each room during the hours of independent study; and the\r\n_officer in charge_, who is detailed daily from the assistant\r\ninstructors of tactics, also visits the rooms at his discretion.\r\n\r\n_Routine of Daily Work._\r\n\r\nA full-dress parade of the battalion takes place every day at sunset,\r\nafter which the cadets are marched to supper, the hour of which varies\r\nwith the season of the year, but is never earlier than 5.30 p.m. Half an\r\nhour after supper the evening call to quarters is sounded for study in\r\nbarracks until tattoo at 9.30. All cadets excepting officers, the\r\nnon-commissioned officers of the battalion staff, and the first\r\nsergeants, must be in bed and their lights extinguished at 10 p.m., the\r\nhour for the signal of _Taps_.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of time on Sundays is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Breakfast at 7 a.m.\r\n  Full-dress parade and inspection at 8.\r\n  Call to quarters for _study in barracks_ at 9.\r\n  Church call at 10.30.\r\n  Recreation after church.\r\n  Dinner at 1 p.m.\r\n  Recreation.\r\n  Call to quarters for study, 3 to 5 p.m.\r\n  After 5 p.m. the arrangement of time is the same as on a week day.\r\n\r\nCadets may obtain leave from the Sunday afternoon study in barracks to\r\nattend church a second time, should they desire it.\r\n\r\nThere is no yearly vacation. When a youth enters West Point, he is fixed\r\nthere, unless discharged, for four years without intermission, with the\r\nexception of two months’ furlough which he may obtain at the end of his\r\nsecond year on certain conditions, and which is subject to a scale of\r\ndiminution graduated according to misconduct.\r\n\r\nThis discipline would be intolerably severe but for the relaxation\r\nafforded by the change from barracks and the section room to camp life.\r\nThe battalion is encamped from about 20th June to 30th August, and\r\nduring that period the time is exclusively devoted to military\r\nexercises, practical instruction, and amusement.\r\n\r\n_Proficiency in Study--Examinations._\r\n\r\nThe system of estimating proficiency in the different subjects studied\r\nis very elaborate. Each instructor keeps daily notes of the proficiency\r\nof the cadets forming the sections of which he has the charge; the\r\ndegree of excellence shown by a cadet at any recitation being recorded\r\nby marks, 3 being the maximum for each lesson, which represents\r\n_thorough_ proficiency; 2.5 signifies _good_; 2 _fair_; 1.5 _tolerable_;\r\n1 _very imperfect_; any thing below 1 is recorded as 0, or complete\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nA weekly report showing the daily credit of each cadet and the aggregate\r\nfor the week, is handed in by each instructor to the professor or head\r\nof his department at the end of the last study on Saturday, and the\r\nprofessor personally delivers the weekly reports of his department to\r\nthe superintendent at the office of the latter between the hours of 12\r\nand 2 p.m. on the same day. The professor at the same time recommends\r\nsuch transfers of students from section to section as he may think\r\nproper. The aggregate weekly credits of each cadet in all the branches\r\nof instruction are then recorded in the superintendent’s office.\r\n\r\nFrom the weekly class reports, and the monthly record of discipline, a\r\nconsolidated report of the progress of the Academy is made up monthly\r\nand forwarded to the inspector of the Academy, who transmits an abstract\r\nof the same to the parent or guardian of each cadet.\r\n\r\nThe weekly class reports form the most important element in determining\r\nthe relative standing of the cadets in their class at the period of\r\ngraduation, but a verifying test, or corrective, is supplied by the\r\nexaminations which take place in January and June, the method of\r\nconducting which is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe January examinations commence on the 2d of the month. The\r\nexamination of the 4th or lowest class is conducted by the whole\r\nAcademic Board, the constitution of which has been already detailed. The\r\nrelative standing of the members of the fourth class, up to that time\r\narranged alphabetically, is then determined by the summing up of the\r\nweekly class reports, verified or corrected by the results of the\r\nexamination. A large proportion of the cadets of the fourth class,\r\nusually from one-sixth to one-eighth of the whole, are yearly pronounced\r\nto be _deficient_, and removed from the Academy at this their first\r\nexamination, which on account of its importance is required to be\r\nconducted by the whole Academic Board. The examinations of the three\r\nother classes take place before committees of the Academic Board, the\r\nwhole Board being divided into two committees for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe June, or _annual_ examinations, commence on the first of the month.\r\nThe first or graduating class alone is examined by the entire Academic\r\nBoard, and the final relative standing of the cadets determined. The\r\nremaining classes are examined before the two committees of the Academic\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\nThe June examinations take place in the presence of the _Board of\r\nVisitors_, the members of which are specially appointed in each year by\r\nthe President of the United States, and whose duty it is to report to\r\nthe Secretary of War, for the information of Congress, on the state of\r\ndiscipline, instruction, &c., &c., of the Academy.\r\n\r\nThe senior assistant professor or instructor of the branch under\r\nexamination is _ex officio_ a member of the Academic Board or of the\r\ncommittee thereof which conducts such examination; and the immediate\r\ninstructor of the section to be examined is likewise associated with the\r\nBoard or its committee so far as relates to the examination itself and\r\nthe arrangement of the section in order of merit.\r\n\r\n_Classification according to Marks._\r\n\r\nTo assist the Academic Board in determining the accurate classification\r\nof any section about to be examined, the immediate instructor of that\r\nsection hands to the Board, before the examination commences, a roll in\r\nthe order of merit in which he considers the members should stand, based\r\non the weekly credits which he had himself assigned.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the examination the same instructor hands to the Board a\r\nsecond roll in the order in which he conceives the members of the\r\nsection should stand, judging by the result of the examination. The\r\ninstructor then retires and the Board proceeds to deliberate.\r\n\r\nEach member of the Board having kept careful notes of the examination,\r\nthe relative standing of the cadets of a section in proficiency is\r\ndetermined by discussion.\r\n\r\nThe question next arises, who, if any, are to be pronounced\r\n_deficient_?--a dictum which inevitably entails discharge from the\r\nAcademy, or putting down to a lower class.\r\n\r\nThe different sections composing the class, having been arranged in one\r\nclass list in order of merit; one of the Board, usually the professor of\r\nthe department concerned, supposing _e.g._ the class to consist of 50\r\nmembers, may move that No. 50 be declared deficient. If the motion is\r\nnegatived on discussion, the salvation of No. 50 proves also the\r\nsalvation of all standing above him. But if the motion be carried, Nos.\r\n49, 48, 47, &c., may be pronounced deficient in like manner, and so on,\r\nuntil a number is reached which is not condemned.\r\n\r\nThe examinations are entirely _vivâ voce_. Each cadet is subjected to a\r\nsearching oral examination of from seven to ten minutes, illustrated on\r\nthe blackboard where the subject admits of it. The daily record of the\r\nproficiency of a cadet in any subject forms, as already stated, by far\r\nthe most important element in fixing his relative standing among his\r\nclassmates: it is only exceptionally that the public examinations alter\r\nmaterially the order of merit which has been previously framed from the\r\nweekly class reports.\r\n\r\nAt the close of each examination the Academic Board reports to the\r\nSecretary of War the names of all cadets who are pronounced deficient in\r\nstudies or discipline, to be discharged from the Academy unless\r\notherwise recommended by the Academic Board.\r\n\r\nThe rule of discharge for deficiency, even in one solitary subject, is\r\nvery rigidly enforced; unless where exceptional circumstances, such as\r\nloss of time on account of illness, or having been unavoidably prevented\r\nfrom joining the Academy until some time after the rest of his class,\r\ninduce the Board to recommend that the cadet shall have another trial by\r\nbeing put back to the next lower class.\r\n\r\nSome detail is necessary to explain how the marks obtained by a cadet at\r\nthe daily recitations are employed to determine the credit he is to\r\nreceive in any given branch of study at the period of his graduation.\r\n\r\nWhere a subject is studied for two years, the maximum time allotted to\r\nany branch of study, the marks gained during the first year help only to\r\nfix a cadet’s relative standing in his class for the year next ensuing.\r\nThe credits shown by the weekly class reports of the second year alone\r\nare taken into account in determining the credit due to a cadet at the\r\nend of his residence.\r\n\r\nThe exact method of fixing the credits due for any one subject is as\r\nfollows. The professor makes out a roll of the class in the order of\r\nmerit finally fixed by the Academic Board at the June examinations. The\r\nfirst on the roll then receives credit for the maximum number of marks\r\nallotted to the subject; the last on the roll receives a credit of\r\none-third of that maximum only. The _common difference_ for all the\r\nmembers of the class between those limits is then calculated, and the\r\nremaining members receive credits varying from the first cadet and from\r\neach other by the amount of that common difference. The figures thus\r\ndetermined represent the credits assigned for any one subject at the\r\nperiod of graduation, and the figure of general merit for each cadet is\r\nmade up of the aggregate credits obtained by him for all the branches of\r\nstudy, with one column included for discipline.\r\n\r\nProficiency in drill or riding does not affect the figure of general\r\nmerit, except indirectly. Inattention or carelessness at these exercises\r\nwould be noted by a certain figure of demerit, and would thereby\r\ndiminish, as will be hereafter explained, the credit to be allotted for\r\ndiscipline at the final examination.\r\n\r\n_Graduation._\r\n\r\nThe qualifications required for obtaining an appointment to the army are\r\nsimply _graduation_, or in other words that a cadet shall have passed\r\nthrough the four years’ course at the Academy without being found\r\n_deficient_ in any one branch of study or in discipline. The proportion\r\nof cadets who fail to graduate is very considerable--nearly one-half.\r\nThe present first class is a fair sample. It numbered 74 on entrance,\r\nand its members are now only 39, and of these three had belonged to the\r\nnext higher class, and were put back for deficiency. From 1842 to 1852\r\nthe exact proportion who succeeded in graduating was 0.510. From 1852 to\r\n1862 the exact proportion was 0.523.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ultimate consequences of idleness in being declared\r\n_deficient_ at the half-yearly examinations are generally sufficient to\r\ninsure diligence, an immediate penalty is attached to any adverse report\r\nagainst a cadet for want of attention to study, or any misconduct in the\r\nrecitation halls. The instructor of any section notes on his weekly\r\nclass reports any cases of decided idleness and all infractions of\r\ndiscipline, and to each reported instance a double penalty is attached,\r\nas to every instance of misconduct at the Academy; the one immediate, in\r\npunishment according to the scale of the offense; the other prospective,\r\nconsisting of a certain figure of demerit, which will rise up in\r\njudgment against the delinquent at the end of his residence, and\r\ndiminish his credit for _discipline_.\r\n\r\nThe _certainty_ of the penalty which attaches to idleness, both in the\r\nimmediate punishment it entails, and its more serious ultimate\r\nconsequences, is found to be sufficient, as a general rule, to attain\r\nthe desired object; hence the character of the cadets for diligence is\r\ndecidedly high.\r\n\r\nThe members of the graduating class have their choice of the services to\r\nwhich they shall be appointed according to their standing on the roll in\r\norder of merit. The order of precedence of corps of the United States\r\narmy is: 1, Engineers; 2, Ordnance; 3, Artillery; 4, Cavalry and\r\nInfantry; and that is, as a general rule, the order of choice. The\r\nSecretary of War may sanction subsequent transfers from one branch of\r\nthe service to another, but such transfers are very rare.\r\n\r\nBeyond the privilege of choice, the only direct inducement held out to\r\ndistinction among his classmates to any cadet, is one which is purely\r\nhonorary. By an order from the Secretary of War so early as the year\r\n1818, the five cadets most distinguished in studies and discipline in\r\neach class at the June examinations, are published each year in the\r\nUnited States Army Register (Army List). The distinction is highly\r\nprized.\r\n\r\nThe advantages resulting from a degree or peculiar distinction at West\r\nPoint after appointment to the army, in respect to professional\r\nadvancement or the obtaining staff employment, are very small. No\r\nspecial qualification is required by law or regulation for admission to\r\nthe staff. When a vacancy occurs any one who desires may make\r\napplication for the vacant appointment to the Adjutant General of the\r\narmy. The decision rests with the Secretary of War or the President. The\r\nhead of the department in which the vacancy exists is the proper person\r\nto insist, if he thinks proper, on the possession of certain\r\nqualifications by the officer who is to be employed as his subordinate.\r\nEven graduation at West Point is not insisted on as a necessary\r\nqualification for staff employment.\r\n\r\n_Discipline._\r\n\r\nEvery young gentleman who passes his probationary examination in the\r\nJanuary after his admission, receives his _warrant of cadet_, and signs\r\nan engagement to serve in the military force of the United States during\r\nthe eight years next ensuing. He thus becomes amenable to the articles\r\nof War and to trial by court-martial.\r\n\r\nThe discipline of the Academy has no resemblance to that of an ordinary\r\ncivil college, but is peculiarly and essentially military. The cadets\r\nare required to clean their own rooms, make their own beds, and clean\r\ntheir own arms and belts.\r\n\r\nThe staff for the maintenance of discipline is distinct from that of\r\ntuition. The professorial staff simply report infractions of discipline\r\nin study, but have no power to punish. All professors and instructors,\r\nhowever, as well as all military officers who may be stationed at West\r\nPoint, are expected to report to the superintendent any improper conduct\r\non the part of a cadet which may come under their observation.\r\n\r\nThe punishments to which a cadet is liable are comprised in the three\r\nclasses following, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1st. Privation of recreation, &c.; extra duty (not guard); reprimands;\r\narrests or confinement to barrack room or tent; confinement in light\r\nprison. _Inflicted only by the superintendent or by his authority._\r\n\r\n2d. Confinement in dark prison. _Only by sentence of court-martial, and\r\nseldom or never resorted to._\r\n\r\n3d. Suspension; dismissal with privilege of resigning; public dismissal.\r\n_Only by sentence of a garrison or general court-martial, which must be\r\napproved by the Secretary of War._\r\n\r\n“Breach of arrest” is treated as a military offense of the worst nature,\r\nand is classified with “mutinous conduct.”\r\n\r\nAll offenses are classified under five heads, and are recorded according\r\nto the following scale:\r\n\r\n  An offense of the 1st class counts   5 demerit.\r\n         “          2d       “         4    “\r\n         “          3d       “         3    “\r\n         “          4th      “         2    “\r\n         “          5th      “         1    “\r\n\r\nAll offenses reported or to be reported against cadets, are read out at\r\nevening parade on the day after commission, excepting offenses in the\r\nsection rooms reported by the instructors, which are read out on Monday\r\nevening’s parade; so that every cadet may have the opportunity of\r\npresenting a written explanation, or plea, in extenuation, of the\r\noffense charged against him.\r\n\r\nThe commandant of cadets attends at his office, in the square of the\r\ncadet barracks, between the hours of breakfast and the first study every\r\nmorning to receive reports of offenses.\r\n\r\nExplanations in writing, on paper of prescribed uniform size, may be\r\ntaken to the commandant by any cadet charged with an offense not later\r\nthan the commandant’s second orderly hour after publication, as a\r\ngeneral rule from which any departure requires to be explained.\r\n\r\nIf the commandant considers the excuse satisfactory, he erases the\r\noffense and tears up the excuse, but forwards an abstract of all\r\noffenses which have not been explained to his satisfaction, with the\r\nwritten explanations, for the decision of the superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent may, on further inquiry, find the explanations of\r\nsome of the offenses forwarded satisfactory, in which case he erases\r\nsuch offenses. To the remainder he allots such immediate punishment, and\r\nsuch marks of demerit in addition, as the cases respectively justify; or\r\nhe may consider the demerit marks sufficient without any immediate\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nThus the offenses of which a cadet may be guilty during his residence\r\nare recorded against him by a very elaborate and just method, and rise\r\nup against him at the period of his graduation. No instance of\r\ncarelessness or inattention to orders is too trifling to be taken notice\r\nof.\r\n\r\nIf any cadet has more than 100 demerit recorded against him in any six\r\nsuccessive months, he is immediately discharged from the Academy as\r\ndeficient in discipline.\r\n\r\nBut during the first year’s residence, offenses count one-third less\r\nthan those committed during the subsequent three years; a cadet of the\r\nfirst year would therefore only be discharged as deficient in discipline\r\nwho had obtained a demerit of 150 within any period of six successive\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe marks of demerit of all the fourth class cadets who have not proved\r\ndeficient in discipline, are wiped out entirely at the end of their\r\nfirst year, and do not therefore affect their relative standing at the\r\nperiod of graduation. The demerit of the first year is only taken into\r\naccount, so as to determine, in combination with the credits received\r\nfor progress in study, the relative standing of the cadets in their\r\nclass for the year next ensuing.\r\n\r\nAt the final examination, the credit to be allotted to any cadet on the\r\nscore of discipline is made up by means of the demerit rolls as follows.\r\n\r\nEach cadet receives a credit of 16.67 for every month during his\r\nresidence, in which he has had no demerit recorded against him, to be\r\ndeducted from his aggregate marks of demerit at the end of his\r\nresidence. The monthly credit is fixed at 16.67, because that number\r\nforms the sixth part of the 100 marks of demerit, which if recorded in\r\nsix months against any cadet would have occasioned his discharge.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that the demerit marks of the fourth class are wiped out\r\nat the end of the first year, and do not count against the cadets at\r\ntheir final examination, the credit of 16.67 is still allowed to cadets\r\nfor every month of their first year in which no demerit was recorded\r\nagainst them and deducted from their aggregate marks of demerit at the\r\nend of their residence.\r\n\r\nThe positive marks of merit for discipline due to any cadet at the end\r\nof his residence are thus determined. The cadet of the graduating class\r\nhaving the lowest aggregate demerit recorded against him is placed\r\n_first_ in discipline, and is credited with the maximum of marks due to\r\nthat subject, viz., 300. The whole class is then arranged in the same\r\nsense, the cadet having the highest demerit being placed last, and\r\nreceiving only one third of the maximum, viz. 100. The common difference\r\nbetween these limits is then calculated for each cadet of the class, and\r\napplied as already explained.\r\n\r\nAlthough the nominal value placed on discipline is represented by the\r\nsame number of marks only as are allotted to each of the more important\r\nbranches of study, in fixing the relative standing of cadets at their\r\nfinal examination; it should be remembered that no candidate can reach\r\nthat period at the Academy who is not fairly well conducted. It would be\r\nquite impossible for any cadet to remain at the Academy who had earned\r\nfor himself the sentence “deficient in discipline,” even though the\r\nmarks of demerit required for that sentence might have been earned by a\r\nsuccession of minor infractions of discipline. And a cadet who might be\r\nguilty of any serious willful offense would be at once removed from the\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nOwing to the very limited time allowed for recreation, games are almost\r\nunknown; and almost the only athletic amusement indulged in is boating\r\non the river, for which, however, Saturday afternoons afford the only\r\navailable time.\r\n\r\nNo difficulty is found to arise from the difference of age among the\r\ncadets in maintaining an uniform system of discipline. The same rules\r\nare applied to all during the whole period of residence.\r\n\r\nThe cadet officers and non-commissioned officers greatly assist in\r\nmaintaining discipline. A daily abstract of offenses show that out of 15\r\noffenses recorded therein, 11 were reported by cadet officers or\r\nnon-commissioned officers.\r\n\r\nThe daily duties are assimilated as much as possible to those of a\r\nbattalion in quarters, and are as follows:\r\n\r\n_The officer in charge_, detailed daily from the assistant instructors\r\nof tactics, is responsible for the proper performance of all the\r\nmilitary duties of the battalion during the day. His tour of duty\r\ncommences at guard mounting (7.30 a.m. in barracks, 8 a.m. in camp); at\r\nwhich time he reports for orders to the commandant at the office of the\r\nlatter. He has an office adjoining that of the commandant where he must\r\nconstantly be present from _reveillé_ to _taps_ (the signal for putting\r\nout lights at 10 p.m.), except when absent on duty or at meals. He is\r\npresent in the cadets’ mess hall during all meals, and superintends\r\nevery parade and roll call. He visits the sentries at his discretion. On\r\nbeing relieved, he includes in the usual morning report of his company,\r\nall offenses which may have come to his knowledge as having occurred\r\nduring his tour of duty.\r\n\r\n_The officer of the day_, is detailed usually from the roster of the\r\ncadet officers, although every cadet of the highest class is appointed\r\nat least once to perform this duty. He is present at guard mounting and\r\nreceives his guard in the usual military manner, after which he reports\r\nfor order to the commandant and is generally under the orders of _the\r\nofficer in charge_. His post of duty is the guard room, which is in the\r\nsame building as, and immediately beneath, the offices of the commandant\r\nand the officer in charge. He causes all calls to be sounded at the\r\nproper time; is present at all parades and roll calls; and receives\r\nreports of all absentees, whom it is his duty immediately thereafter to\r\nseek and to order when found to repair to their respective duties unless\r\nproperly excused. He reports to the officer in charge all absentees whom\r\nhe may not be able to find, and all cadets who fail to obey his orders.\r\nHe directs the formation of all the class sections before marching to\r\nthe section rooms; receives reports of absentees from the section\r\nmarchers, and requires the latter to march off their sections in a\r\nproper military manner. He is responsible for the suppression of all\r\nirregularities in quarters or their vicinity during his tour. He visits\r\nthe quarters during the hours of independent study and receives reports\r\nof absentees. He visits all the quarters at _Taps_, and reports\r\nabsentees to the officers in charge. He afterwards visits the room of\r\nevery cadet absent every 15 minutes until the return of the absentee, or\r\nuntil otherwise directed by the officer in charge. On the back of the\r\nguard report which he forwards next morning to the commandant, he\r\nrecords all offenses which come to his knowledge as having occurred\r\nduring his tour; and presents with it all permits and passes that have\r\ncome into his hands, all of which are required to be deposited with him.\r\nThe officer of the day is relieved from study during his tour of duty.\r\n\r\n_Daily Guard._--A cadet guard, consisting of one sergeant, four\r\ncorporals, and 24 privates, is mounted every morning at 7.30. The cadets\r\nof the guard remain in the guard-room during the day, excepting the\r\nhours of study.\r\n\r\n_Sentries_ are posted during the hours of recreation, the most important\r\nposts being the different entrance halls of the cadet barracks. Ten\r\nminutes after the _call to quarters_, during the day on Sundays, and\r\nevery evening, it is the duty of each such sentry to visit all the rooms\r\nbelonging to his particular entrance hall. He then orders all cadets\r\nwhom he may find visiting in rooms not their own to their proper\r\nquarters, and reports all who fail to comply promptly with his orders to\r\nthe sergeant of the guard, as well as all absentees; and the sergeant of\r\nthe guard passes on all such reports to the officer of the day. A sentry\r\nsimilarly reports every irregularity that may occur on his beat, and\r\nparticularly the name of any cadet who may have absented himself from\r\nthe barracks for more than ten minutes. A high sense of the honorable\r\nconfidence reposed in a sentry seems to be generally entertained; and\r\nthere is every reason to believe that the cadet sentries at West Point\r\nperform their duties in a trustworthy and satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nThe general duties of the battalion are assimilated as much as possible\r\nto those of a battalion in quarters. The daily detail of duties is drawn\r\nup by the cadet adjutant. The cadets for guard are detailed by the first\r\nsergeants of their respective companies at each evening parade, and the\r\ndaily routine is in this respect as nearly as possible the same as that\r\nof military life.\r\n\r\nThere is no yearly vacation; and the furlough which each cadet may\r\nobtain at the end of his second year is subject to the following\r\nconditions, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1st. If he has obtained 350 demerit in the two preceding years, he is\r\ndetained twelve days; if 325, 300, 275, 250, or 200 demerit within the\r\nsame period, he is detained ten days, eight days, five days, three days,\r\nor two days respectively.\r\n\r\n2d. He is required to sign a certificate, declaring that he has in _no\r\nmanner improperly interfered with, or molested or injured new cadets_.\r\nThe furlough of any cadet declining to sign this certificate is limited\r\nto one month, from 28th July to 28th August. Although there have been\r\ninstances of cadets declining to sign this certificate, it is probable\r\nthat, as a general rule, the cadet conscience places a liberal\r\ninterpretation on the words of the formula.\r\n\r\nLeave of absence from the Academy for one to two days is occasionally\r\ngranted, but only for exceptional reasons.\r\n\r\n_Buildings._\r\n\r\nThe _cadet barrack_ is a handsome stone building of four stories. It\r\ncontains 176 rooms, of which 136 are cadets’ quarters, 14 feet by 22\r\nfeet, arranged in eight divisions, each division having its own\r\nentrance, and having no interior communication with the other divisions.\r\nNot more than two cadets are lodged in the same room. The two beds in\r\neach room are curtained off from the room, and separated from each other\r\nby a partition. There are numerous bathing rooms in the basement, to\r\nwhich the cadets have access.\r\n\r\nEach division of quarters is under the superintendence of an assistant\r\ninstructor of tactics, who visits the rooms of his division three times\r\nin the course of each day, and occasionally during the night. He makes a\r\ndaily report in writing to the commandant of the condition of the rooms\r\nunder his charge, noting all delinquencies that may have come to his\r\nknowledge since his last report.\r\n\r\nA division of quarters is divided into two _subdivisions of quarters_ of\r\ntwo floors each, each subdivision being under the charge of one of the\r\ncadet officers, who has his quarters therein, and who is responsible for\r\nthe discipline of his subdivision, and for the proper fulfillment of all\r\norders that may be issued relative to the police of quarters. He visits\r\nall the rooms of his subdivision 30 minutes after reveillé, and\r\nimmediately after _taps_ (lights out), notes all irregularities, and\r\nmakes a daily report in writing to the superintendent of his division,\r\nrecording all delinquencies, and certifying that since the report of the\r\nprevious day he has faithfully performed all duties required of him as\r\n_inspector of subdivision_.\r\n\r\nThe _Academy_ is a building detached, containing the following rooms and\r\ndepartments, viz.:--\r\n\r\n_Chemical department_, comprising laboratory, lecture-room, room for\r\nelectrical experiments, and a work-room; _fencing department_;\r\n_gymnasium_; _mineralogical collection_; _engineering department_,\r\ncomprising drawing and model rooms; _artillery model room_;\r\n_mathematical model room_; _drawing academy_; _trophy room_; _picture\r\nand statue galleries_; _mineralogical section rooms_; and 10 _recitation\r\nrooms_ (or halls of study).\r\n\r\nAnother detached building contains the _observatory_; and _library_ of\r\n20,000 volumes, to which the cadets have access at stated times.\r\n\r\nThere are no rooms specially set apart for day rooms, reading or\r\nrecreation rooms.\r\n\r\nThe _mess hall_ is a detached building. The central hall where the\r\ncadets take all their meals is 96 feet by 46 feet and 20 feet high.\r\nQuarters for the purveyor with kitchen and bakery, and with quarters for\r\nthe necessary servants in the basement, are attached.\r\n\r\nThe cadets are formed in the barrack square previous to each meal, and\r\nare marched to and from the mess hall. The officer in charge visits the\r\nmess hall at all meal times. The senior cadet officer present is\r\nresponsible for good order.\r\n\r\nThe _Riding School_ is detached and is admirably adapted to its purpose.\r\n\r\n_Expenses._\r\n\r\nThe Academy is entirely supported by the State. The average annual cost\r\nfor 62 years has been $137,315; and this sum includes the cost of all\r\nbuildings and structures, of repairs and maintenance. The yearly\r\nappropriations during the last eight years have varied from $170,000 to\r\n$200,000, but does not include certain sums which are paid out of the\r\nregular appropriation to the War Department.\r\n\r\nA new cadet is admitted to the Academy on the 1st of July. From that\r\ndate he is credited with Government pay at the rate of $30 a month,\r\nwhich allowance is calculated as sufficient to pay for the whole cost of\r\nhis equipment and maintenance. As the monthly pay is, however, small\r\ncompared with the first cost of uniforms and outfit, a new cadet usually\r\ndeposits with the treasurer of the Academy on entrance from $60 to $80,\r\nto be credited to his account. Thenceforth all wants and necessaries are\r\nsupplied to the cadet by the Government, the prices being a trifle above\r\ncost and charged against his account. At the end of his residence, a\r\nbalance is struck, and the sum standing to his credit, if any, is paid\r\nover to him. It is possible by this arrangement for a very careful and\r\nsteady lad to secure his education, his maintenance during four years, a\r\nposition in the army, and $100 in addition, at the time of his\r\ngraduation.\r\n\r\nSTAFF FOR GOVERNMENT AND INSTRUCTION, JAN. 1, 1872\r\n\r\nSUPERINTENDENT.--Col.

REGULATIONS\r\n\r\nRELATIVE TO\r\n\r\nTHE ADMISSION OF CADETS INTO THE MILITARY ACADEMY.\r\n\r\n  Applications for admission into the United States Military Academy at\r\nWest Point, should be made by letter to the Secretary of War. By\r\nprovision of law, each Congressional and Territorial district, and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, is entitled to have one cadet at the Military\r\nAcademy, and no more. The district appointments are made on the\r\nnomination of the member of Congress representing the district at the\r\ndate of the appointment. The law requires that the individual selected\r\nshall be an actual resident of the Congressional district of the State\r\nor Territory, or District of Columbia, from which the appointment\r\npurports to be made. Also, appointments “at large,” not to exceed ten,\r\nare annually made. Application can be made, at any time, by the\r\ncandidate himself, his parent, guardian, or any of his friends, and the\r\nname placed on the register. No preference will be given to applications\r\non account of priority; nor will any application be entered in the\r\nregister when the candidate is under or above the prescribed age; the\r\n_precise age_ must be given; _no relaxation of the regulation in this\r\nrespect will be made_; nor will any application be considered in cases\r\nwhere the age and other qualifications of the candidates are not stated.\r\nThe fixed abode of the candidate, and _number_ of the Congressional\r\ndistrict which he considers his permanent residence, must be set forth\r\nin the application. The pay of a cadet is $30 per month, to commence\r\nfrom his admission into the Military Academy, and is considered ample\r\nwith proper economy, for his support.\r\n\r\n  The appointments will be made annually in the month of February or\r\nMarch, on the applications made within the preceding year. The claims of\r\nall the candidates on the register will be considered and acted upon. No\r\ncertain information can be given as to the probable success of the\r\ncandidate, before the arrival of the period for making the selections.\r\nPersons, therefore, making applications, must not expect to receive\r\ninformation on this point.\r\n\r\n  As a general rule, no person will be appointed who has had a brother\r\neducated at the institution.\r\n\r\n  QUALIFICATIONS.\r\n\r\n  Candidates must be over sixteen and under twenty-one years of age, at\r\nthe time of entrance into the Military Academy; must be at least five\r\nfeet in height, and free from any deformity, disease, or infirmity,\r\nwhich would render them unfit for the military service, and from any\r\ndisorder of an infectious or immoral character. They must be able to\r\nread and write well, and perform with facility and accuracy the various\r\noperations of the four ground rules of arithmetic, of reduction, of\r\nsimple and compound proportion, and of vulgar and decimal fractions.\r\n\r\n  It must be understood that a full compliance with the above conditions\r\nwill be insisted on--that is to say--the candidate must write in a fair\r\nand legible hand, and without any material mistakes in spelling, such\r\nsentences as shall be dictated by the examiners; and he must answer\r\npromptly, and without errors, all their questions in the above-mentioned\r\nrules of arithmetic: failing in any of these particulars, he will be\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n  It must also be understood, that every candidate will, soon after his\r\narrival at West Point, be subjected to a rigid examination by an\r\nexperienced medical board; and should there be found to exist in him any\r\nof the following causes of disqualification, to such a degree as will\r\nimmediately, or in all probability may at no very distant period, impair\r\nhis efficiency, he will be rejected:\r\n\r\n  1. Feeble constitution and muscular tenuity; unsound health from\r\nwhatever cause; indications of former disease; glandular swellings, or\r\nother symptoms of scrofula.\r\n\r\n  2. Chronic cutaneous affections, especially of the scalp, or any\r\ndisorder of an infectious character.\r\n\r\n  3. Severe injuries of the bones of the head; convulsions.\r\n\r\n  4. Impaired vision from whatever cause; inflammatory affections of the\r\neyelids; immobility or irregularity of the iris; fistula lachrymalis,\r\n&c., &c.\r\n\r\n  5. Deafness; copious discharge from the ears.\r\n\r\n  6. Loss of many teeth, or teeth generally unsound.\r\n\r\n  7. Impediment of speech.\r\n\r\n  8. Want of due capacity of the chest, and any other indication of a\r\nliability to a pulmonic disease.\r\n\r\n  9. Impaired or inadequate efficiency of one or both of the superior\r\nextremities on account of fractures, especially of the clavicle,\r\ncontraction of a joint, extenuation, deformity, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n  10. An unnatural excurvature or incurvature of the spine.\r\n\r\n  11. Hernia.\r\n\r\n  12. A varicose state of the veins, of the scrotum and spermatic cord,\r\n(when large,) sarcocele, hydrocele, hemorrhoids, fistulas.\r\n\r\n  13. Impaired or inadequate efficiency of one or both of the inferior\r\nextremities on account of varicose veins, fractures, malformation, (flat\r\nfeet, &c.,) lameness, contraction, unequal length, bunions, over-lying\r\nor supernumerary toes, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n  14. Ulcers, or unsound cicatrices of ulcers likely to break out\r\nafresh.\r\n\r\nThe above Regulations were issued by the War Department in 1862.\r\nAlthough it appears from this official document, that “applications for\r\nadmission into the United States Military Academy at West Point, should\r\nbe made by letter to the Secretary of War,” and that “the claims of all\r\ncandidates on the register will be considered and acted upon,” it is\r\nalso stated, that “_the district appointments are made on the nomination\r\nof the member of Congress representing the district at the date of the\r\nappointment_.” This delicate duty, and great privilege of selecting, out\r\nof all the young men between the ages of sixteen and twenty-one years,\r\nin a Congressional district of at least 70,000 inhabitants, who aspire\r\nto serve their country in a military capacity, the one _best_ qualified,\r\nor even _well_ qualified, is not imposed or conferred directly by law,\r\nbut by the practice of the appointing power, on the member for that\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n  _Summary of Qualifications (in Circular of 1871)._\r\n\r\n  A sound body and constitution, a fixed degree of preparation, good\r\nnatural capacity, an aptitude for study, industrious habits,\r\nperseverance, an obedient and orderly disposition, and a correct moral\r\ndeportment are such essential qualifications that candidates knowingly\r\ndeficient in any of these respects should not, as many do, subject\r\nthemselves and their friends to the chances of future mortification and\r\ndisappointment, by accepting appointments to the Academy and entering\r\nupon a career which they can not successfully pursue.\r\n\r\n  _Method of Testing the Qualifications of Candidates._\r\n\r\n  Candidates should be able to _read_ with facility from any book,\r\ngiving the proper intonation and pauses, and to _write_ portions that\r\nare read aloud for that purpose, spelling the words and punctuating the\r\nsentences properly. Some historical work should preferably be chosen,\r\nand successive passages read till the reading exercises are ended. Then,\r\nfrom another part of the book, a suitable paragraph or paragraphs, of\r\nreasonable length, should be read aloud to the candidates, with proper\r\nintonations and pauses, as a guide to punctuation, and written down by\r\nthem as read.\r\n\r\n  In Arithmetic they should be able to perform with facility examples\r\nunder the four ground rules, and hence should be familiar with the\r\ntables of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and be\r\nable to perform examples in reduction and in vulgar and decimal\r\nfractions, such as:\r\n\r\nAdd ⅔ to ¾; subtract ⅖ from ⅚; multiply ¾ by ⅞; divide ⅖ by ⅜\r\n\r\n  Add together two hundred and thirty-four thousandths, (.234,)\r\ntwenty-six thousandths, (.026,) and three thousandths, (.003.)\r\n\r\n  Subtract one hundred and sixty-one ten thousandths (.0161) from\r\ntwenty-five hundredths (.25.)\r\n\r\n  Multiply or divide twenty-six hundredths (.26) by sixteen thousandths\r\n(.016.)\r\n\r\n  They should also be able to change vulgar fractions into decimal\r\nfractions, and decimals into vulgar fractions, with examples like the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nChange 15/16 into a decimal fraction of the same value.\r\n\r\n  Change one hundred and two thousandths (.102) into a vulgar fraction.\r\n\r\n  In simple and compound proportion, examples of various kinds should be\r\ngiven, and the candidates should understand the principles of the rules\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n  In English Grammar candidates should exhibit a familiarity with the\r\nnine parts of speech and the rules in relation thereto; should be able\r\nto parse any ordinary sentence given to them, and, generally, should\r\nunderstand those portions of the subject usually taught in the higher\r\nacademies and schools throughout the country, under Orthography,\r\nEtymology, Syntax, and Prosody.\r\n\r\n  In Descriptive Geography they should name, locate, and describe the\r\nnatural grand and political divisions of the earth, and be able to\r\ndelineate any one of the States or Territories of the American Union,\r\nwith its principal cities, rivers, lakes, seaports, and mountains.\r\n\r\n  In History they should be able to name the periods of the discovery\r\nand settlement of the North American continent; of the rise and progress\r\nof the United States, and of the successive wars and political\r\nadministrations.\r\n\r\n  The examinations in Orthography, Grammar, Geography, and History may\r\nbe either oral or written.\r\n\r\n  Candidates undoubtedly deficient in any one requisite, or more than\r\none, should resign any expectation of admission till the deficiency is\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n  Candidates should first be examined by a medical practitioner, with\r\nreference to the physical requirements and disqualifications set forth\r\nin the circular; such as are manifestly disqualified being so informed.\r\n\r\n  The condition of body and mind considered together should be regarded,\r\nas well as general proficiency in the studies as a whole. Especially\r\nshould natural ability and manifest aptitude for acquiring and applying\r\nknowledge take precedence of mere scholastic finish and readiness of\r\nanswer to former problems. Other things being equal, preference should\r\nbe given, in order, to those whose claims are strengthened by military,\r\nnaval, or other distinguished service rendered to the country by\r\nthemselves or their immediate relatives; and it is better for candidates\r\nto be nearer the minimum than the maximum age.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOARD OF VISITORS\r\n\r\nIn the Regulations for the government of the Military Academy, approved\r\nJuly 1, 1816, provision for the appointment of a Board of Visitors, to\r\nconsist of five competent gentlemen, who should attend at each general\r\nexamination, and report thereon to the War Department through the\r\nInspector, who appears to have been from the start the senior officer of\r\nthe corps of Engineers.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 (Aug. 8), Congress authorized the appointment annually, by the\r\nPresident, of a Board of Visitors, whose duty it was made to attend each\r\nyearly examination, and report to the Secretary of War upon the\r\ndiscipline, instruction, police and fiscal affairs of the Academy. The\r\nmembers were to be taken from one half of the number of States,\r\nalternating yearly with the other half, each member being a _bona fide_\r\nresident of the State from whence appointed, and each Congressional\r\ndistrict being in turn designated to furnish an appointee. Of the\r\nmembers each year, not less than six must be taken from among officers\r\nactually serving in the militia.\r\n\r\n  _Extract from Act of Congress approved August 8, 1846, amended by Acts\r\nof March 16, 1868, and February 21, 1870._\r\n\r\n  That the President is authorized to appoint a Board of Visitors to\r\nattend the annual examination of the Military Academy, whose duty it\r\nshall be to report to the Secretary of War, for the information of\r\nCongress, at the commencement of the next succeeding session, the actual\r\nstate of the discipline, instruction, police, administration, fiscal\r\naffairs, and other concerns of the institution: _Provided_, That the\r\nwhole number of visitors each year shall not exceed seven: _Provided,\r\nfurther_, That no compensation shall be made to said members beyond the\r\npayment of their expenses for board and lodging while at the Military\r\nAcademy, and an allowance, not to exceed eight cents per mile, for\r\ntraveling by the shortest mail route from their respective homes to the\r\nAcademy, and back to their homes. And in addition to the other members\r\nof the Board of Visitors to be appointed by the President, according to\r\nlaw, to attend the annual examination of cadets at the United States\r\nMilitary Academy, there shall be on every such board two Senators, to be\r\ndesignated by the Vice-President, or President _pro tempore_ of the\r\nSenate; and three members of the House of Representatives, to be\r\ndesignated by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, such\r\ndesignations respectively to be made at the session of Congress next\r\npreceding the time of such examination; and the Senators and members so\r\nappointed shall make full report of their action as such visitors, with\r\ntheir views and recommendations in regard to the said Military Academy,\r\nwithin twenty days after the meeting of Congress, at the session next\r\nsucceeding the time of their appointment.\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF VISITORS FOR 1871.\r\n\r\n  Twenty-five years ago West Point was substantially separate from the\r\noutside world; for several months of the year a mail was not received\r\noftener than once in three or four days. The presence of visitors was\r\nalmost wholly unknown, and the officers and cadets formed a community by\r\nand of themselves. The relations existing between the officers and\r\ncadets was like that at present existing between the officers and\r\nsoldiers at a military post. Cadets were permitted to visit at the\r\nquarters of professors and officers on Saturday afternoons, and at no\r\nother time. But so reserved were the manners of officers, even on such\r\noccasions, that the privilege, though recognized, was very rarely\r\nexercised. There was substantially no social intercourse between the\r\nofficers and the cadets.\r\n\r\n  In those days, too, the rigor of discipline put all cadets, the sons\r\nof the rich and the sons of the poor, upon a common footing. The\r\nregulations not only prohibited any cadet from receiving money from his\r\nparents and friends, but no place existed, or was permitted to exist, on\r\nthe limits, where cadets could expend money. Occasionally a cadet was\r\nallowed to purchase what he pleased under the head of “sundries;” not\r\nexceeding one dollar in amount, and that only on the order of an officer\r\nin charge.\r\n\r\n  But all this has changed. West Point is now or fast becoming a place\r\nof fashionable resort. Hotels have been erected in near proximity to the\r\npost, and hundreds of visitors now repair thither where one did in\r\nformer years. This influx of fashionable life has caused a relaxation of\r\nthe rules in regard to cadets visiting. The great distance between\r\nofficers and cadets has been gradually diminished. Cadets of the first\r\nclass may now visit officers every day in the week, and officers and\r\ncadets associate together with a freedom of intercourse not formerly\r\nknown. Insensibly the standard of discipline has been lowered, until the\r\nAcademy has less than formerly the character of the Regular Army, and\r\nmore the features of a militia establishment, where officers and men are\r\nseparated while on duty, but mingle in social intercourse when the hour\r\nof drill or parade has passed.\r\n\r\n  Although the regulation in regard to cadets receiving money remains\r\nunchanged, yet, at present, a new functionary, known as the “cadet\r\nconfectioner,” is allowed to keep open on cadet limits a place of resort\r\nwhich cadets are known to frequent daily to enjoy the table, and where\r\nthey may treat their fellows without stint or limit. Thus one of the\r\nelements of equality which formerly existed among the cadets is\r\ndestroyed, and the son of a wealthy man may fare sumptuously, while the\r\npoor boy must confine himself to such food as the mess-hall affords.\r\n\r\n  Many other causes might be mentioned as contributing to the present\r\ncondition of things, and many other illustrations of the change from the\r\ncustom of former years might be given. But those members of the board\r\nwho have been appointed by the Vice-President and Speaker of the House\r\nof Representatives, and whose duty it is by law specially made to report\r\nto Congress upon this subject, will doubtless do so at length, and\r\ntherefore this board pass the subject without as full a consideration as\r\nwould otherwise be demanded. But this board, feeling the importance of a\r\nhigh state of discipline to the efficiency of the Academy, to accomplish\r\nthe purpose for which it is maintained, earnestly recommend a return to\r\nthe stricter kind of discipline which was administered years ago. An\r\narmy must be governed by different methods and upon different principles\r\nfrom a civil society and to an army and to every military establishment\r\ndiscipline is a necessity.\r\n\r\n  With a view to this end, in the opinion of this board, the\r\nsuperintendent and commandant of cadets should always be officers of\r\nhigh rank, who, by their age and military distinction, can command not\r\nonly the respect but the implicit obedience of the cadets.\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE BOARD OF VISITORS FOR 1863.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Visitors invited by the Secretary of War to visit the\r\nMilitary Academy at West Point, to make “a full and free investigation\r\nof the Military and Scientific instruction of the Cadets, and of the\r\ninternal police, discipline, and fiscal concerns of the institution, and\r\ncommunicate the results of their observations, with any suggestions for\r\nthe improvement of the Academy,” consisted of the following members:\r\n\r\n  Oliver S. Munsell, _Illinois_, PRESIDENT. Birdsey G. Northrop,\r\n_Mass._, SECRETARY. Thomas M. Allen, _Missouri_. Henry Barnard,\r\n_Connecticut_. Samuel W. Bostwick, _Ohio_. Thomas Brainard, _Penn._\r\nCyrus Bryant, _Illinois_. A. W. Campbell, _West Virginia_. Ralph W.\r\nEmerson, _Mass._ Oran Faville, _Iowa_. John H. Goodenow, _Maine_. P. D.\r\nGurley, _District of Columbia_. Oliver P. Hubbard, _New Hampshire_.\r\nEdward Maynard, _District of Columbia_. Henry S. Randall, _New York_.\r\nWilliam H. Russell, _Conn._ William A. Rust, _Maine_. Albert Smith, _New\r\nHampshire_.\r\n\r\nThe Visitors introduce an account of their inspection with the following\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n  Some of our number came with objections and prejudices against the\r\nAcademy. But all doubts as to the value and importance of the\r\ninstitution were banished by the evidence presented in the course of our\r\npersonal inquiries into its present condition and actual results. The\r\nMexican war clearly evinced the value of military science. Still more\r\nhas the present war demonstrated the necessity of maintaining, and even\r\nenlarging our Military Academy.\r\n\r\n  This Academy belongs to the whole nation. So far as its purpose and\r\nnumbers permit, it is the Peoples’ College. It is maintained for the\r\nspecial benefit of no particular section, sect, party, or class. We\r\ncould discover no evidence of aristocracy, exclusiveness, or caste. The\r\nCadets represent all sects and parties, and almost all nationalities,\r\nnow naturalized among us. The poor are not denied its privileges, for\r\nthe expenses of all are paid alike. If particular dogmas have at any\r\ntime prevailed here, the fact is an accidental, rather than an essential\r\none, and should be referred to the ruling influences at the seat of\r\ngovernment, and not to any inherent element in the local organization at\r\nWest Point.\r\n\r\nTheir Report has been communicated to the Secretary, by whom the same\r\nwill be transmitted to Congress--to receive such attention as the\r\nSecretary and Congress may see fit to bestow on its various suggestions.\r\nBy permission of the Secretary, we transfer to our pages, that portion\r\nof the Report in which the subject of the Admission of Cadets--their\r\nnumber, age, attainments, and mode of appointment, is discussed with\r\nconsiderable fullness.\r\n\r\nADMISSION OF CADETS.\r\n\r\nIn concluding the report of their inspection of this, the only national\r\nmilitary school, to which the country naturally looks for the\r\norganization and command of her armies, and the construction of her\r\nworks of defense, the Visitors would respectfully urge on the\r\nconsideration of the Department, an immediate and thorough revision of\r\nthe law and regulations relating to the admission of Cadets--the number,\r\nthe qualifications required, and the mode of ascertaining these\r\nqualifications, and of making the appointments. No matter how\r\nappropriate may be the location, how complete the buildings and\r\nequipment, and how skillful and faithful the teachers, unless there is a\r\nconstant and sufficient supply of pupils of the right age, character,\r\nbodily and mental vigor and aptitude, as well as aspirations for a\r\nmilitary career, the public will be disappointed in the practical\r\nworkings of the institution.\r\n\r\n1. The number of pupils in the Military Academy is determined by the\r\nlaw, which limits the Cadet Corps of the United States Army to one cadet\r\nfor each Congressional District in the several States, one for each\r\nTerritory, one for the District of Columbia, and to forty more, whom the\r\nPresident may appoint, ten each year, from the country at large, without\r\nreference to their residence. Under this law, if each Congressional\r\nDistrict and Territory were represented, the whole number of cadets\r\nwould be two hundred and eighty, but owing to vacancies by withdrawal or\r\nnon-appointment in Congressional Districts in the States involved in the\r\nrebellion, the number at this time is reduced to less than two\r\nhundred--and the graduating class of 1863, to twenty-five--a number\r\naltogether inadequate for the regular army in time of peace, and much\r\nbelow the present and future exigences of the service, while the expense\r\nof the Academy remains the same. We are assured by the Superintendent\r\nthat without any additional expense for building and material equipment,\r\nand with a small advance in the pay of pupils and assistant teachers,\r\nthe Cadet Corps could be increased to four hundred. The Visitors are\r\nunanimously of the opinion that the corps should be at once increased to\r\nthis number, and should be maintained at this maximum at all times, by\r\nauthorizing the President to appoint to any vacancy which may remain\r\nunfilled for three months by reason of nullification, secession,\r\nrebellion, or any other cause. If the appointments to fill and maintain\r\nthe Corps at this maximum, can be selected out of the many American\r\nyouths, ambitious to serve their country in the army, on the plan of an\r\nopen competitive examination in the several States, the Visitors believe\r\nthat ninety out of every one hundred thus appointed will go through the\r\nwhole course with honor, and the average ability, scholarship, and good\r\nconduct of the whole corps, will equal that now reached by the first ten\r\nof each class.\r\n\r\n2. By the original law providing for the appointment of cadets to the\r\ncorps of Artillerists and Engineers, and by the act of 1812, by which\r\nthe Military Academy was made to consist of the Corps of Engineers, the\r\ncandidates for cadets were to be “not under the age of fourteen, nor\r\nabove the age of twenty-one years.” By regulations of the Department the\r\nminimum age is fixed at sixteen years, and the Visitors believe that the\r\ninterests of the Academy and the military service, will be promoted by\r\nmaking the legal age for admission between eighteen and twenty-one\r\nyears. The four years preceding and including eighteen are peculiarly\r\nthe formative period of the body, mind, and character, and should be\r\ndevoted to the acquisition of right habits of study and general culture,\r\nas the proper foundation for all special and professional training,\r\nwhich should not be commenced until the constitution is consolidated,\r\nthe taste for a pursuit is distinctly pronounced, and the moral\r\ncharacter is naturally developed under the influences and supervision of\r\nhome. The experience of Europe, and particularly of France and England,\r\nhas led to the abandonment of juvenile military schools, as nurseries\r\nfor officers; and the very common practice of nominating candidates who\r\nexceed the legal age, expresses the convictions of our own people that\r\nmilitary studies now require more maturity of mind than was deemed\r\nnecessary in the early history of the Academy. The present want of\r\nuniformity as to age and mental discipline explains in part, the wide\r\ndisparity of attainments between members of the same class. With few\r\nbrilliant exceptions, confined to cadets of rare aptitude and vigor of\r\nmind, the most solid practical education is obtained by those who come\r\nto West Point when at least eighteen years of age, with at least a good\r\npreparation in English studies, and a taste for mathematical and\r\nmilitary pursuits.\r\n\r\n3. The school attainments required by law of candidates for admission to\r\nthe Military Academy, are as rudimentary and limited as our language can\r\nexpress--far below, we are assured, the requisitions of any similar\r\nschool in the world. Prior to 1812, when the Academy was little more\r\nthan a school of mathematics, taught by two professors, in the line of\r\ngeometrical and algebraical demonstrations, and the practical exercises\r\nwere confined to surveying, and the simplest forms of military\r\nconstruction, the candidates were not subjected to any examination. The\r\nact of 1812, provides that “each candidate previously to his\r\nappointment, shall be well versed in reading, writing, and arithmetic,”\r\nand by regulations of the department, the knowledge of arithmetic is\r\nrestricted to only a portion of that science. There were special reasons\r\nat the start for thus limiting the amount of knowledge, when the minimum\r\nage of admission was fixed at fourteen years, and the Academy was\r\nproperly a juvenile military school, like all cadet schools in Europe at\r\nthat time. At that date, science entered far less than now into the art\r\nof war, as applied to the means and modes of attack as well as of\r\ndefense. Besides, the opportunities of even elementary instruction were\r\nthen far less widely or equally distributed through all the States than\r\nnow, when the general government has set apart over sixty million acres\r\nof the best land in aid of primary schools in all the new States, and\r\nnearly every State legislature has subjected the entire property of\r\ntheir several communities to taxation for the support of public\r\ninstruction. Now that the requirement as to age has been advanced from\r\nthe fourteenth to the sixteenth year, and by the voluntary action of\r\nparties having the nomination, or seeking the appointment, to the\r\neighteenth year, we see no reason why the school attainments\r\ncorresponding to, and compatible with that age, should not be also\r\nrequired. The least that should be demanded of any candidate is that\r\namount of general culture and attainments, which constitutes a good\r\nEnglish education, and which it is now the aim of the public schools,\r\nand their boast, to give without partiality, to all, poor and rich\r\nalike, if the advantages they proffer are properly improved. And we see\r\nno injustice in fixing the standard of general attainments and culture\r\nas high as that now reached by cadets in good standing at the close of\r\ntheir first year in this Academy, including even an elementary knowledge\r\nof one modern language. If the French, or Spanish, or German language is\r\nto be mastered by American officers for the sake of the military science\r\nand literature which it embodies, or its uses in conversation, or\r\nofficial duty, called for by the exigences of our foreign relations,\r\nboth in peace and war, its acquisition should be begun as early in life\r\nas possible, while the organs of speech are flexible, and the\r\ngrammatical and etymological difficulties of a new language are more\r\nreadily surmounted. Judging from the results of the examinations we have\r\nwitnessed here, and what we know of the attainments made by students in\r\ncolleges elsewhere, very few persons, who begin the study of modern\r\nlanguages, late in their school life, in the pressure of other studies,\r\never attain the mastery of even one, so as to be able to use it as an\r\ninstrument of written or spoken communication, or make its treasures of\r\nscience and literature a familiar possession.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the disciplinary and practical value of\r\nearlier and longer attention to one or more modern languages, to those,\r\nwhose minds will otherwise be almost exclusively subjected to the\r\npeculiar training of the mathematics, there can be no doubt that young\r\nmen who have reached the age of eighteen, and desire to profit by the\r\nspecial studies of a purely military school, should exhibit in their\r\nlanguage, habits, and attainments that intellectual, moral, and\r\nesthetical culture, which the public or private schools of any State\r\ncan, and should give to any youth of average ability of that age.\r\n\r\n4. Low as the requirements for admission now are, from a defective and\r\nvicious mode, as we believe, of selecting candidates, and making\r\nappointments to the Cadet Corps, the number of candidates nominated and\r\nprovisionally appointed, who present themselves at West Point and shrink\r\nfrom any examination, or who fail to pass even the entrance examination\r\nwhich is confined to reading a few passages of familiar English prose or\r\nverse, and writing a few sentences from dictation, and performing on the\r\nblackboard a few operations of the most elementary character in\r\narithmetic,--or being admitted, are not able to gain or keep a\r\nrespectable standing for one year, although the studies of the first\r\nyear belong to a general, and not a military education,--or by a\r\n“special providence,” manage just to escape dismission from\r\nincompetency, and graduate,--is disgracefully large. The country abounds\r\nin youth, competent to master and profit by the course of instruction\r\nhere provided, and ambitious of enjoying these privileges of education,\r\nand opportunities of distinction; and a selection by lot from the\r\njuvenile population of any state, could not result in so few prizes, and\r\nsuch a dreary waste of blanks as have been realized from the\r\nappointments made, in the necessary absence of all personal knowledge of\r\nthe candidates by the appointing power, on the recommendation, or\r\nnomination of one or more persons in each Congressional District, in no\r\nway responsible for the incompetency of the individuals named.\r\n\r\nFrom official tables prepared from the records of the Academy,[14] it\r\nappears that the proportion of all who graduate, to all appointed in\r\nsuccessive periods of ten years, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  For Ten Years, from 1802 to 1811,      0.606\r\n     “      “      “  1812 to 1821,      0.289\r\n     “      “      “  1822 to 1831,      0.377\r\n     “      “      “  1832 to 1841,      0.472\r\n     “      “      “  1842 to 1851,      0.510\r\n     “      “      “  1852 to 1861,      0.523\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: See Boynton’s “History of Military Academy at West\r\n    Point,” p. 293.]\r\n\r\nFrom official returns furnished by the Superintendent, a portion of\r\nwhich are hereto appended, (B. C.) it appears that out of 4626 who have\r\nbeen admitted to the Corps of Cadets, (including two hundred new\r\nmembers,) only 2020 were able to graduate, and of those who failed,\r\n(2398, excluding those who remain,) more than three-fifths broke down in\r\nthe first year in studies which in almost every military and scientific\r\nschool in Europe are required for admission. Out of the whole number\r\nregularly nominated, recommended, and provisionally appointed from 1841\r\nto 1863, more than twenty per cent. failed to pass the examination, as\r\nto health and constitution, or the slight examination in reading,\r\nwriting, and ciphering. And this proportion would be increased by the\r\nnumber who withdrew in advance from the consciousness of their unfitness\r\nfor a position to which ambitious and influential friends had promoted\r\nthem. Out of the whole number admitted from 1851 to 1862, more than\r\none-third failed during their first year. The proportion of graduates to\r\nthe whole number admitted is 46 per cent. and of those who failed to\r\ngraduate, 54 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe Visitors are unanimously of opinion that in a matter of such vital\r\nimportance as the right organization and command of the armies of the\r\nUnited States, on which the honor and safety of the whole country\r\ndepend, the original appointment to the Cadet Corps which is the _first\r\nstep_ in promotion to such command, as well as to all the special duties\r\nwhich attach to the engineer service, should not be made in any case\r\nexcept on the principle of finding the best youth for the place--having\r\nthe health, character, vigor of body, maturity and aptitude of mind, and\r\npreparatory knowledge, to profit by the opportunities of the special\r\nmilitary training provided by the government for this corps, and a\r\ndecided taste and expressed desire for a military career. And to this\r\nend, the law and regulations should provide for the rigorous exclusion\r\nin advance of all who can not present testimonials from the teachers\r\nunder whose instruction they have been for the two years next previous,\r\nthat in their opinion they possess the qualifications above specified,\r\nand who do not make a written declaration of their desire to enter the\r\nCorps for the purpose of qualifying themselves to labor in the military\r\nservice of the government, to which they will bear true allegiance\r\nagainst all enemies foreign and domestic, and over all state and local\r\nauthority, government and constitution whatever. To select the best out\r\nof any number who may present their testimonials and written\r\ndeclarations, public examination should be held of all applicants at\r\nsuch times and places as the law should prescribe, by such persons and\r\nunder such regulations as the Department shall be authorized to appoint;\r\nand the results of such examination of each person examined, and in each\r\nsubject specified by law, should be returned to the Department, in which\r\nreturn the applicants should be arranged in the order of merit. From\r\nthis merit roll, revised from year to year, all appointments to the\r\nCadet Corps should be made, and in the order of merit as assigned by the\r\nexaminers.\r\n\r\nThis principle of appointment and promotion by merit which we advocate,\r\nis in full and successful operation in the classification and\r\nadvancement of cadets in the Academy itself, and the country will be\r\nsatisfied if the same principle can be as fairly and rigorously enforced\r\non all who aspire to enter, as well as on all promotions in the service\r\nafter leaving the institution. The principle itself, of selection by\r\nmerit, either in the mode of public examination, or of careful and\r\nsearching inquiry by competent and impartial educators, designated for\r\nthis purpose by the parties to whom custom and not law had assigned the\r\ngrave responsibility of nominating candidates, has been voluntarily\r\napplied in several Congressional Districts. Not a cadet known to have\r\nbeen thus selected and appointed, has ever broken down from want of\r\nvigor of body or mind, or failed to reach and maintain an honorable\r\nposition on the merit roll of the Academy; and to this careful selection\r\nby those who felt the responsibility of the privilege accorded to them,\r\nis the country indebted for its most eminent and useful officers.\r\n\r\nTo the objection that selection by public competitive examination, will\r\ninvolve expense, we reply, that any expense which will do away with the\r\nprejudices against the Academy, which the present system of patronage\r\nhas done so much directly and indirectly to evoke and foster, and which\r\nwill, at the same time, exclude incompetent, and secure the services of\r\nvigorous, talented, well trained officers, for every arm of the service,\r\nwill be well incurred. But, in our opinion, there will be no more\r\nexpense in selecting and educating a given number of cadets on this\r\nplan, than on the present. The two thousand cadets who were appointed by\r\npatronage and failed to graduate, cost the government, directly and\r\nindirectly each year, a much larger sum than it would have taken to have\r\nexcluded them in advance from the institution by competitive\r\nexamination, and filling their places by better men; and their exclusion\r\nby substituting better material, would have been an incalculable gain to\r\nthe Academy, facilitating its discipline, increasing the value of its\r\ninstruction, and giving to the army a larger number of competent\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nThe objection, that the mode of making all appointments by open\r\ncompetitive examination, will deprive the President, and members of\r\nCongress of the opportunity of appointing the sons of meritorious\r\nofficers, or poor, and it may be, orphan boys of genius--is more\r\nplausible than real. That such appointments have been made, to the\r\nmanifest advantage of the country, is certain. But we know not a single\r\ninstance of such marked success, on the part of a cadet thus appointed,\r\nas to attract investigation, where the same youth would not have secured\r\nthe appointment in open competition. But if he had failed, and the place\r\nhad been filled by one better qualified, the country would have been no\r\nloser, and he would have suffered no injustice or neglect. We fear, from\r\nan abuse of this amiable motive of rewarding meritorious parents, and\r\nassisting the poor, that in some instances, weak, ignorant, and\r\nincompetent persons are appointed, as though this Academy were a public\r\ncharity school, or home for orphans; and not a special school for\r\nmilitary instruction and training, for which the great object, in any\r\nmode of appointment, is to select those who will profit most by its\r\nadvantages, and do the country the greatest service after being thus\r\neducated at its expense.\r\n\r\nTo the objections that, in these examinations, “the most forward boys\r\nwill have the best chance, and such boys seldom make the best men,” and\r\nthat no amount of book knowledge can give assurance of the great\r\nmilitary genius, “which must be born and not made,” we reply, that these\r\nobjections apply just as forcibly to any plan of nomination, and to\r\nevery system of instruction. But we believe that those examinations can\r\nbe and will be so conducted as to distinguish what is precocious from\r\nwhat is the healthy development of the faculties, what is solid from\r\nwhat is showy in attainments, what is vigor, grasp and aptitude of mind\r\nfrom what is mere memory and quickness, in competing candidates. All of\r\nthese candidates must bring the testimonials of their former teachers,\r\nas to their character, ability and attainments, must have reached the\r\nage of eighteen years, and will be called upon to exhibit orally as well\r\nas in writing their knowledge and opinions on subjects which require\r\njudgment, reflection, presence of mind and decision. If a young man of\r\neighteen and upward shows that he has done well what he had undertaken\r\nto do thus far in life, that he has preserved a sound constitution in\r\nvigorous health, has mastered the studies appropriate to his age, is\r\nhonest, diligent, thoughtful, teachable, courageous, courteous, and\r\nambitious of excellence generally, then the country has every assurance\r\nwhich can be given that on this basis of character, talents,\r\nattainments, and application, a solid fabric of military education can\r\nbe reared, and that in the hour of trial he will show not only courage\r\nto dare, but competence to devise, influence and command. In the\r\nresponsibilities of such an hour will be found the fruitage of all his\r\nprevious promise and preparation.\r\n\r\nTo the objection--“that a competitive examination must always result in\r\nthe success of the best instructed, wholly irrespective of the capacity\r\nof the competing candidates; and the plan will thus secure for the\r\ncountry the services of dull mediocrity well instructed, and exclude\r\ngenius without opportunities of development,”--we reply, that this does\r\noccur now under the present system, but need not, and never has been the\r\nresult of competitive examination properly conducted. The examination\r\nwhich we propose to have inaugurated, is not to search simply or mainly\r\nfor the results of memory or diligence, but for “vigor and aptitude of\r\nmind” in reference to the special purposes of this Academy. The\r\nexamination will be poorly conducted, and will operate here widely\r\ndifferently than elsewhere, if it does not only exclude in advance\r\npalpable incompetency, and ascertain beyond doubt the possession by all\r\nthe successful candidates, of that knowledge which is the basis of a\r\nspecial military training, but also seek, and give credit in the result,\r\nfor the quick eye, the firm set mouth, the vigor and elasticity of body,\r\nthe rapid decision, the contempt of danger, the competency to influence\r\nand command--and all the other marks of the incipient soldier and\r\nofficer, as well as the mathematical tastes and qualities of mind which\r\nindicate the successful engineer. Composed as every Examination\r\nCommission might be, of at least one experienced officer of the United\r\nStates Army, of one member (past or present,) of the Academic Board, of\r\none officer of the State Militia, as well as one or more experts in\r\neducational matters, the military qualities of body, character and mind,\r\nwill be sought for as well as the mere results of memory, diligence and\r\ngood opportunities of instruction, in the competing candidates.\r\n\r\nTo the objection, that candidates will make special preparation, and in\r\nthe phraseology of the class-room, “cram for the occasion,” we\r\nreply,--to such preparation and cramming as cover the whole ground of a\r\ngood English education, we can see no possible objection; the more of\r\nit, the better. If the preparation is only crude and on the surface, we\r\nare sure that the ploughshare of interrogation requiring precise\r\nanswers, oral and written, will very soon expose its superficial and\r\nundigested character.\r\n\r\nTo the sifting out and selection by open competition, might be added a\r\nperiod of probation for the successful candidates--making their first\r\nyear’s connection with the academy a further test of capacity,\r\npreparation, and aptitude for a military career. No pains and no expense\r\nshould be spared to exclude from the academy and the service,\r\nincompetent, indifferent, and unteachable cadets and officers; such men\r\nare “cumberers of the ground,” and no influence and inertia should be\r\npotent enough to resist the inevitable working of the principle of open\r\ncompetition, applied at frequent intervals, and at every stage of\r\npromotion, in getting rid of such cadets and officers.\r\n\r\nThe fact that such a public examination is to be held from year to year,\r\nand that the educational privileges of this Academy, and immediate and\r\nprospective promotion in the army are the prizes which await success,\r\nwill, in five years call forth more latent genius in the obscure corners\r\nand poor families of a State, than has ever been sought out by the\r\nlantern of patronage, (which is now seldom carried beyond the family, or\r\nneighborhood, or party of the person having the nomination,) since the\r\nfoundation of the Academy. With the network of public and elementary\r\nschools, woven by state legislation over all the land--with public\r\nschools of a higher grade, and special schools of science and the arts\r\nalready established, at short intervals, or which will be called into\r\nexistence by the demand for a higher and different preparation from that\r\nnow given, it may be safely said, that no genius, likely to attract the\r\nattention of a member of Congress, will exist, which will not be\r\ndeveloped under the same influences by which the “dull mediocrity” of\r\nthe rest of the community will be educated. Once set in the path of\r\ninstruction and development, real genius will assert its own claims to\r\nattention, and will, on a first or second trial, before any board of\r\nexaminers, make its vigor, courage, and persistence felt. The result\r\nwill be the same in this institution, as in every really good Public\r\nHigh School and Free Academy--all classes as to wealth, occupation,\r\nreligious and political affinities will be represented,--provided the\r\nregulations are judicious, and the examination practical and impartial.\r\n\r\nThis is the experience of the competitive principle in France ever since\r\nit was inaugurated by Carnot in the Polytechnic School at Paris, and\r\nNapoleon extended its application to every public special school, and to\r\npromotion in every department of administration, civil as well as\r\nmilitary. And where is there more general administrative ability,\r\ncentral and local? Where are abler or better trained officers, military\r\nand civil, to be found? Where does “well instructed mediocrity,” no\r\nmatter how well backed up by wealth, find less favor, or genius for\r\norganization and command, no matter how poor or unfriended, find such\r\nspeedy and sure recognition?\r\n\r\nThe experience of England in the trial of the two principles of\r\npatronage and competitive examination for admission, not only to the\r\nmilitary and naval schools, but to the East India and the Civil service\r\ngenerally, is instructive, and especially on the points which we are now\r\nconsidering. Prior to the Crimean war, (which exposed the utter\r\nincompetency of a large number of officers, who had obtained their\r\nmilitary education and promotion by patronage and purchase,)--admission\r\nto the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, was by nomination, and the\r\nage fixed by law, was fourteen years.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War was satisfied by personal inquiry in 1855, that\r\nnothing could do so much to narrow and cramp the full development of a\r\nboy’s mind, as his long confinement from so early an age among lads\r\nhaving the same limited attainments, special studies, and\r\ndestination;--that a majority of those admitted on nomination and\r\nthrough influential friends, had only the minimum qualifications\r\nspecified by law;--that to most cadets the severer studies were irksome\r\nand imperfectly mastered, on account of immaturity of mind and imperfect\r\npreparation;--that the certainty of promotion by influence and purchase,\r\nafter obtaining the diploma of the Academy, and not unfrequently without\r\nit, took away all stimulus for continued study;--that resignations were\r\ncommon, when the profession of arms ceased to be a pastime, or could be\r\nexchanged for something that paid better--and the service was incumbered\r\nby officers without large and trained capacity for command, although not\r\ndeficient in courage and dash. Under these circumstances the Secretary\r\nof War, advanced the minimum age of candidates from fourteen to eighteen\r\nyears, removed all the general studies of the Academy into the\r\npreparatory course, and opened the doors of admission to those only, who\r\ncould prove their title to enter by personal merit, in a free\r\ncompetitive examination. The same principle was applied to appointments\r\nand promotion in the new regiments called for by the exigences of the\r\ngreat war in which England found herself engaged.\r\n\r\nSubjects, time, and places of examination, were officially made known\r\nthroughout the kingdom, and commissions to conduct the examinations were\r\nappointed, composed of men of good common sense, military officers, and\r\neminent practical teachers and educators. The results as stated in a\r\ndebate in Parliament, five years later, on extending this principle to\r\nall public schools, and to all appointments and promotions in every\r\ndepartment of the public service, were as follows:--In the competitive\r\nexaminations for admission to the Royal Military Academy, candidates\r\nfrom all classes of society appeared--sons of merchants, attorneys,\r\nclergymen, mechanics, and noblemen, and among the successful\r\ncompetitors, every class was represented. Among the number was the son\r\nof a mechanic in the arsenal at Woolwich, and the son of an earl, who\r\nwas at the time a Cabinet Minister--the graduates of National Schools,\r\nand the students of Eton, and other great Public Schools. The most\r\nsuccessful candidates were between the ages of eighteen and nineteen, as\r\nis found to be the case in competitions for admission to the Polytechnic\r\nSchool of France. Out of 579 successful candidates for the latter,\r\nbetween 1854 and 1857, 450 were over eighteen years. But the most\r\nimportant result of the competitive examinations for Woolwich, was the\r\nsuperior mental ability, the vigorous health, and eagerness for study\r\nexhibited by the new classes, and the small number who have failed on\r\naccount of ill-health or incompetency. On this point, Mr. Edward\r\nChadwick, in a Report before the National Social Science Association, at\r\nCambridge, in 1862, says:--\r\n\r\n“Out of an average three hundred patronage appointed cadets at the Royal\r\nMilitary Academy at Woolwich, for officers of engineers and the\r\nartillery, during the five years preceding the adoption of the principle\r\nof open competition for admission to the Academy, there were fifty, who\r\nwere after long and indulgent trial, and with a due regard to\r\ninfluential parents and patrons, dismissed for hopeless incapacity for\r\nthe service of those scientific corps. During the five subsequent years,\r\nwhich have been years of the open competition principle, there has not\r\nbeen one dismissed for incapacity. Moreover, the general standard of\r\ncapacity has been advanced. An eminent professor of this university who\r\nhas taught as well under the patronage as under the competitive system\r\nat that Academy, declares that the quality of mind of the average of the\r\ncadets, has been improved by the competition, so much so, that he\r\nconsiders that the present average quality of mind of the cadets\r\nthere,--though the sorts of attainment are different, has been brought\r\nup to the average of the first classmen of this (Cambridge) university,\r\nwhich of itself is a great gain. Another result, the opposite to that\r\nwhich was confidently predicted, by the opponents to the principle, has\r\nbeen that the average physical power or bodily strength, instead of\r\nbeing diminished, is advanced beyond the average of their predecessors.”\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Royal Military School at Woolwich to competition, on\r\nthe basis of a more advanced age, and more thorough general education,\r\nhas not only drawn in pupils of higher average ability and attainments,\r\nbut has enabled the authorities to extend the course of instruction. In\r\nthis, the only safe way, they solved the problem which has tortured the\r\ningenuity of the friends of our Academy--of crowding new studies\r\nacknowledged to be desirable if not indispensable, into a course already\r\ntoo crowded for cadets so unequally, and, many of them, so imperfectly\r\nprepared for the course as it is.\r\n\r\nAnother result of immense importance to the educational interests of\r\nGreat Britain has followed the introduction of these open competitive\r\nexaminations for appointments to the Military and Naval Schools, to the\r\nEast India service, as well as to fill vacancies in the principal\r\nclerkships in the War, Admiralty, Ordnance and Home Departments of the\r\ngovernment:--a stimulus of the most healthy and powerful kind, worth\r\nmore than millions of pecuniary endowment, has been given to all the\r\ngreat schools of the country, including the universities of England,\r\nScotland and Ireland. As soon as it was known that candidates, graduates\r\nof Trinity College, Dublin, had succeeded over competitors from Oxford\r\nand Edinburgh in obtaining valuable appointments in the East India\r\nservice--the professors in the latter universities began to look to\r\ntheir laurels. As soon as it was known to the master of any important\r\nschool, that some of his leading pupils might compete in these\r\nexaminations, and that his own reputation as a teacher depended in a\r\nmeasure on the success or failure of these pupils, he had a new motive\r\nto impart the most vigorous and thorough training to his whole school.\r\n\r\nThe success of candidates who had never seen the inside of a government\r\nMilitary School, in open competition for appointments to the Artillery\r\nand Engineer Corps, in the new regiments raised in 1855, over those who\r\nhold the diplomas of the Royal Military Academy, was one of the reasons\r\nwhich led to a thorough revision of the whole system of military\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThese results, imperfectly presented here, will, the Visitors believe,\r\nbe realized from the changes, which they now suggest, in the\r\nrequirements as to age, attainments, capacity and aptitude, and\r\nespecially in the mode of ascertaining these qualifications, of\r\ncandidates for appointments to the Cadet Corps of the United States\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nTo the present low requirements, and mode of selecting cadets, do they\r\nattribute the hostility which they know exists, to some extent, against\r\nthis Academy, in different parts of the country. The charges of\r\npersonal, and political favoritism in making nominations, and the\r\nabsence of reasonable search, among all the youth of a district, for the\r\nbest qualified in natural endowments and acquired knowledge irrespective\r\nof the poverty, or wealth, or occupation, or family, or party relations\r\nof the parents or guardians, we are forced to believe, in too many\r\ninstances, to be well founded. To these hasty and injudicious\r\nnominations, do we attribute the bitter disappointments of so many\r\nindividuals and families caused by the numerous failures to pass the\r\nalmost formal entrance examinations in reading, spelling, penmanship,\r\nand elementary operations of arithmetic, or if admitted, to maintain a\r\nrespectable standing in conduct and studies during their first year’s\r\nconnection with the institution. To this inequality of preparation and\r\nmaturity of mind on entrance, do we attribute the astonishing disparity\r\nof capacity and attainments in the members of the same class, and the\r\nvery large proportion of all who are admitted, who fail to graduate in\r\nvery high standing as men of science or military promise.\r\n\r\nTo this want of preparatory knowledge, maturity of mind, and taste for\r\nmathematical and military studies, do we attribute most of the\r\ndifficulties of internal administration, and class-room instruction. So\r\nlong as the cadet is a boy, or if full grown in body, a youth with only\r\nboyish tastes, and without scholarly and soldierly aspirations,--so long\r\nas not a few are in the Academy, not because they sought its privileges\r\nfrom an inward and irrepressible impulse to a military career, but for\r\nthe eclat of a military position to be resigned when such position\r\ninvolves sacrifices; _so long_ will the admission of each new class, and\r\nespecially, the period of encampment be signalized not only by boyish\r\npranks, but by personal outrages on unoffending members of the same\r\ncorps, which we had supposed to belong to the dark ages of collegiate\r\ninstitutions, when boyish inmates were congregated in large numbers,\r\naway from the restraints of family discipline;--so long will the time,\r\nskill, and patience of able professors, which should be devoted to the\r\nelucidation of difficult scientific principles and their applications to\r\nmilitary art, be engrossed in supplying the defects of an elementary\r\neducation, which should have been obtained by the cadet as well, or\r\nbetter, at home; so long will the severe mathematical studies, and their\r\nspecial applications, difficult enough to task a well disciplined mind\r\neven with the preparation provided in a thorough knowledge of\r\narithmetic, algebra, and geometry,--be irksome in the extreme, and be\r\nnever mastered to any useful purpose to the army of the United States,\r\nby more than one half of the graduates of the Academy;--so long will the\r\ncountry be disappointed in the subsequent career of many graduates, for\r\nwhose military instruction and training all these appropriate and costly\r\npreparations have been made.\r\n\r\nIn view of these and other considerations the Board of Visitors\r\nunanimously recommend that the law and regulations relating to the\r\nmilitary academy be so modified as to provide as follows:\r\n\r\nI. The Cadet Corps of the army of the United States shall consist of\r\nfour hundred members, to which each state and territory shall be\r\nentitled to a number equal to its representation in the Congress of the\r\nUnited States, and the remainder shall be designated by the President\r\nfrom the country at large, including the District of Columbia; and he\r\nshall also fill, in the same way, any vacancy which for any cause may\r\nremain unfilled, for three months after the annual examination in each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nII. No person shall be appointed to the cadet corps until he has been\r\nfound qualified in the particulars designated by law, after a public\r\nexamination conducted in such places, at such times, and in such manner\r\nas Congress shall prescribe; from which examination no person resident\r\nof that portion of the country for which the same is held, shall be\r\nexcluded, who shall present credentials from the teacher or teachers\r\nwhom he had last attended, that he is over seventeen, and under\r\ntwenty-one years of age, of unblemished moral character, and personal\r\nhabits, of good physical strength and constitution, and has given\r\nevidence of aptitude and vigor of mind for the studies and duties of a\r\nmilitary career. The examiners shall make return under oath to the\r\nSecretary of War, of the persons so presenting themselves, examined, and\r\nfound qualified, arranged in the order of merit, specifying the\r\nresidence and school or schools which they have attended in the two\r\nyears previous, and the degree of merit exhibited in each subject of the\r\nexamination. And all appointments to fill vacancies for any state or\r\nterritory, or for the country at large, shall be made from these\r\nreturns, and in the order of merit as assigned by the examiners, until\r\nthe same shall be revised by new regulations of the Department.\r\n\r\nIII. No person shall be returned to the Secretary of War as a suitable\r\ncandidate for admission to the Cadet Corps, unless he\r\n\r\n1.

the country at large,\r\nare obtained from Tables prepared by Capt. Boynton, in his “History of\r\nthe United States Military Academy.” The per centage of graduates,\r\nfailures, &c., is calculated from the totals thus obtained. The minute\r\naccuracy of the results is slightly effected by the difficulty of\r\nassigning the twenty-six Cadets admitted, whose place of residence was\r\nunknown, to their respective States. The column of Cadets to which each\r\nState and Territory is entitled in the apportionment of members of\r\nCongress under the Census of 1860, is official so far as States not\r\ninvolved in rebellion are concerned; the latter is given according to\r\nthe Census of 1850.\r\n\r\nOPINIONS OF COL. THAYER AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\n_On the recommendations of the Board of Visitors as to the conditions of\r\nadmission to the United States Military Academy at West Point._\r\n\r\nExtract from a letter of COL. SYLVANUS THAYER, Superintendent of the\r\nUnited States Military Academy, from 1816 to 1831.\r\n\r\n  “The Extracts from the Report of the Visitors at West Point, for 1863,\r\nI have read with the highest satisfaction, not to say admiration. The\r\nsubject of the admission of Cadets, their number, age, attainments, and\r\nmode of appointment, is discussed in the most complete and able manner,\r\n_ne laissant rien a desirer_, as far as I can see. I am naturally the\r\nmore pleased from finding my own views so perfectly reflected in many\r\nimportant particulars. The only difference I notice is the small\r\naddition to my standard of attainment for admission. I not only agree to\r\nthat, but would raise the standard as high as Congress would be willing\r\nto adopt. The higher the standard, the more perfect will be the test of\r\ncapacity. The subject, as you may well suppose, is not a new one with\r\nme. More than forty years ago I made my first effort to have the mode of\r\nappointment by nomination, done away with, and admission by open\r\ncompetition adopted. My last effort before the late one, was made in\r\n1858, while I was in command of the Corps of Engineers, during the\r\nabsence of Gen. Totten. At the same time, I recommended a higher\r\nstandard of attainment, a Board of Improvement, and some of the other\r\nchanges comprised in my “Propositions,” but with little expectation,\r\nhowever, that my solitary voice would be heeded. After long despairing,\r\nI am now encouraged and cheered. Admission by competitive examination,\r\nopen to all, may not be attained as soon as we wish, but come it must at\r\nno distant day. Let every future Board of Visitors recall the attention\r\nof the Government to your excellent Report; no new arguments are needed,\r\nand let all the publications devoted to the cause of education, agitate\r\nthe question unceasingly.”\r\n\r\nWe have been favored with the perusal of the “Propositions,” referred to\r\nin Col. Thayer’s letter, and submitted by him to the Secretary of War,\r\nin 1863, with “Suggestions for the Improvement of the United States\r\nMilitary Academy.” So far as the Visitors go, their views, and those of\r\nCol. Thayer, are almost identical, but Col. Thayer’s communication to\r\nthe Secretary includes many other suggestions relating to the\r\ninstruction, discipline, and administration of the institution, which we\r\nhope will be adopted by the Secretary, and embodied in the Regulations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the modifications suggested by Col. Thayer, we should\r\nlike to see the theoretical course at West Point reduced to two years;\r\nand Special Courses, or Schools of Application and Practice established\r\nfor the Engineer, Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry service, open only to\r\nthose who should show natural aptitude, and the proper amount of\r\nacquired knowledge, whether graduates of the scientific course of West\r\nPoint, or any State scientific or classical school, in a competitive\r\nexamination. In each of these courses or schools, there should be a\r\ngraduation, and promotion, in the particular service, according to\r\nmerit. Our whole system of military instruction should terminate in a\r\nSTAFF SCHOOL, open only to those who, in addition to the knowledge\r\nrequired for graduation in at least two of the above special courses,\r\nshould have had at least three years actual experience in service. While\r\nmembers of the Staff School, these candidates for the Staff Corps,\r\nshould, if called for by the State authorities, assist without\r\ncompensation, in conducting Military Encampments of the Officers of the\r\nState Militia, like those held every year in Switzerland, and\r\ncorresponding to what is known in this country to Teacher’s Institutes.\r\nThe graduates of the Staff School, should constitute the Staff Corps,\r\nfrom which all vacancies in the higher offices of the Regular Army\r\nshould be filled, and all appointments to new regiments be made.\r\n\r\nEXTRACT from a letter of GEN. H. K. OLIVER.\r\n\r\n  I have read with the utmost care, the Extract from the Report of the\r\nBoard of Examiners of the Military Academy at West Point, for the year\r\n1863, and most heartily concur in the views therein set forth, and\r\nespecially in that portion of it, which recommends a competitive\r\nexamination of candidates for admission. In all its relations it is\r\nright. In fact it stands out prominently as the only proper mode of\r\nadmittance.\r\n\r\n  My intimate acquaintance with the Academy, having attended the\r\nexamination in 1846, by invitation, and again in 1847, as Secretary of\r\nthe Board of Visitors for that year, enables me to speak with reasonable\r\nauthority. These visits afforded me opportunities, which I improved to\r\nthe utmost, and most minutely, to become intimately well informed of the\r\neffect of the prevailing method of selection, and of its practical\r\nresults upon character and scholarship after admission, as well as to\r\nknow, with what degree of fidelity, the institution was answering the\r\nintent of its founding, and the just expectation of the country; and I\r\nwas then satisfied, and subsequent observation has confirmed me in my\r\nopinion, that whatever of deficiency prevailed, was traceable to the\r\nmethod of admission. Faithful teachers and faithful teaching will\r\nachieve great results, but they can not make good, incompetent natural\r\nendowments, nor infuse vigor and life into sluggish natures. I sincerely\r\nhope that the Government will feel the force of your views, and comply\r\nwith your most commendable recommendations.\r\n\r\nRESOLUTION adopted by the American Institute of Instruction at the\r\nAnnual Meeting in August; 1863.\r\n\r\n  WHEREAS, the security and honor of this whole country require in the\r\nmilitary and naval service the right sort of men with the right sort of\r\nknowledge and training; _and whereas_, the military and naval schools\r\nestablished to impart this knowledge and training will fail in their\r\nobjects, unless young men are selected as students of the right age,\r\nwith suitable preparatory knowledge, with vigor of body, and aptitude of\r\nmind, for the special studies of such schools; _and whereas_, the mode\r\nof determining the qualifications and selecting the students, may be\r\nmade to test the thoroughness of the elementary education given in the\r\nseveral States, therefor\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the Directors of the American Institute of\r\nInstruction are authorized and instructed to memorialize the Congress of\r\nthe United States, to revise the terms and mode of admission to the\r\nNational Military and Naval Schools, so as to invite young men of the\r\nright spirit, and with vigor and aptitude of mind for mathematical and\r\nmilitary studies, who aspire to serve their country in the military and\r\nnaval service, to compete in open trial before intelligent and impartial\r\nexaminers in each State, without fear or favor, without reference to the\r\nwealth, or poverty, or occupation, or political opinions of their\r\nparents or guardians, for such admission, and that in all cases the\r\norder of admission shall be according to the personal merits and fitness\r\nof the candidate.”\r\n\r\nEXTRACT from letter of Prof. Monroe, St. John’s College, Fordham, N.Y.\r\n\r\n  I rejoice that some one has taken hold of this subject at last. It\r\nneeds only to be understood to be adopted; for I can not see from what\r\nquarter any opposition to it can arise. You rightly observe that “all\r\nthe educational institutions of the several States” are interested in\r\nthis mode of appointment. Great Britain, France, and many of the\r\nContinental States admit to their military schools the most competent\r\nyoung men who present themselves, and the method is found to be as\r\neconomical as it is equitable. Long years of _winnowing_ is saved to the\r\nGovernment; for the subjects who present themselves are, of course, the\r\nmost capable. For several years I was a witness of the beneficial\r\neffects produced on youth in France by the stimulation of their energies\r\nin order to undergo an examination for admission into the military or\r\nnaval schools. Our present mode of appointment appears to be an anomaly;\r\nfor while monarchies find it expedient to adopt a less exclusive mode of\r\nsustaining their military organizations, we still cling to one founded\r\non patronage and prerogative. Many of our young men in different\r\ncolleges and educational institutions have a taste and vocation to the\r\nmilitary profession, and have an equal right to compete for a place in\r\nthe only fields where such a taste can be gratified--viz., in the army\r\nand navy. These careers should then be open to them. There is danger and\r\nwant of policy in suppressing the legitimate aspirations of young men in\r\na nation which is, say what we can, passionately fond of military glory.\r\n\r\nEXTRACT from the Report of the Board of Visitors of the U.S. Military\r\nAcademy at West Point for 1864.\r\n\r\n  The main features of the Report of the Visitors for 1863 we most\r\ncordially approve, especially its recommendations of competitive\r\nexamination, and raising the age and qualifications of candidates for\r\nadmission. The only student who obtained his appointment through\r\ncompetitive examination (introduced into his district by the member of\r\nCongress upon whose recommendation he was appointed from the common\r\nschools[15] of New York) graduated at the head of his class this year.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: The successful candidate, out of twenty competitors,\r\n    was a member of the Free Academy of the city of New York, and\r\n    stood in scholarship about the middle of his class.]\r\n\r\nThe beneficial effect on schools, as regards both pupils and teachers,\r\nof throwing open appointments in civil, as well as in military and naval\r\nservice, to competition, and giving them to the most meritorious\r\ncandidates, on examination, is thus commented on in the Report of the\r\nQueen’s Commissioners on the Endowed Schools of Ireland:\r\n\r\n  This measure has received the unanimous approval of our body, who\r\nregard it as an effectual method of promoting intermediate education.\r\nThe experience already obtained respecting the operation of public and\r\ncompetitive examinations, so far as they have hitherto been tried,\r\nleaves no doubt on our minds that the extension of this system would,\r\nunder judicious management, produce very beneficial effects, both in\r\nraising the standard of instruction, and in stimulating the efforts of\r\nmasters and of pupils. The educational tests adapted for examinations\r\nfor the public service would be, in our opinion, of all others the most\r\ngeneral in their character, and therefore, those best calculated to\r\ndirect the efforts of teachers to that course of mental discipline and\r\nmoral training, the attainment of which constitutes, in our opinion, the\r\nchief object of a liberal education. The experience of the civil service\r\ncommission has shown the shortcomings of all classes in the most general\r\nand most elementary branches of a literary and scientific education.\r\n\r\n  These views are strongly corroborated by the testimony, appended to\r\nthe Report, of prominent teachers and educators consulted on the\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n  Prof. Bullen, in the Queen’s College, Cork, remarks:--“No movement\r\never made will so materially advance education in this country as the\r\nthrowing open public situations to meritorious candidates. It has given\r\nalready a great impulse to schools and will give greater. The\r\nconsequence of throwing the civil service open to the public is already\r\nbeginning to tell--although only in operation a few months, it has told\r\nin a most satisfactory manner in this city; and, from what I can see, it\r\nwill have the happiest results on education generally.”\r\n\r\n  Prof. King, Head Master of a Grammar School at Ennis, writes:--“These\r\nexaminations have already caused improvements in my own school by\r\ninducing me to give instruction in branches which I had never taught\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\n  The Dean of Elphin, the Archdeacon of Waterford and the Bishop of\r\nDoun, advocate the measure on the ground of its tendency to produce\r\ncompetition between schools, and to stimulate private enterprise. The\r\nBishop of Cashel “thought that this competition would be more valuable\r\nthan the endowment of schools giving education gratuitously.”\r\n\r\n  In confirmation of the above views, and as an illustration of the\r\nbenefits likely to accrue both to the cause of education and to the\r\npublic service from the extension of the system of competitive\r\nexaminations, we may add that, at the late competitive examination for\r\ncertificates of merit held by the Royal Dublin Society Mr. Samuel\r\nChapman, who was educated solely by the Incorporated Society, as a\r\nfoundation boy, obtained the first place and a prize of £5. In\r\nconsequence of this success the Bank of Ireland immediately appointed\r\nhim to a clerkship. Mr. Chapman was originally elected to the Pococke\r\nInstitution, from a parish school, by a competitive examination; and on\r\nhis leaving the Santry school Prof. Galbraith appointed him his\r\nassistant in Trinity College, in consequence of the skill in drawing\r\nwhich he exhibited, and his knowledge of mathematics, as proved by his\r\nfinal examination.\r\n\r\nIII. COMPETITIVE EXAMINATION AT WEST POINT.\r\n\r\nDEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, MAY 18TH, 1864.\r\n\r\nThe Bill making appropriation for the Military Academy being under\r\nconsideration, Senator Anthony, of R. Island, remarked on the following\r\namendment:\r\n\r\n  _And be it further enacted_, That hereafter, in all appointments of\r\ncadets to the Military Academy at West Point, the selections for such\r\nappointments in the several districts shall be made from the candidates\r\naccording to their respective merits and qualifications, to be\r\ndetermined under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of War\r\nshall from time to time prescribe.\r\n\r\nThis, Mr. President, is substantially the proposition which I offered at\r\nthe last session; and although I was not so fortunate as to obtain for\r\nit the assent of the Senate, mainly from an apprehension of practical\r\ndifficulties in carrying out what is admitted to be a desirable reform\r\nif it could be effected, yet the general expression of Senators was so\r\nmuch in favor of the principle, and I have been so much strengthened in\r\nmy views on the subject by subsequent reflection and examination, that I\r\nam emboldened to renew it.\r\n\r\nI differ entirely from those who are fond of disparaging the Military\r\nAcademy. It has been of incalculable service to the country; it is the\r\norigin and the constant supply of that military science without which\r\nmere courage would be constantly foiled, and battles would be but Indian\r\nfights on a large scale. Not to speak of the Mexican war, throughout the\r\nwhole of which West Point shone with conspicuous luster, it is safe to\r\nleave the vindication of the Academy to the gallant and able men who\r\nhave illustrated the annals of the war that is now raging. Nor have its\r\nindirect advantages been less marked than its direct. It has kept alive\r\na military spirit, and kept up a good standard of military instruction\r\nin the volunteer militia. It furnished, from its graduates who have\r\nretired from the Army, scores of men who rushed to the head of our new\r\nlevies, who organized and instructed them, inspired them with\r\nconfidence, and led them over many a bloody field to many a glorious\r\nvictory. Large numbers of our best volunteer officers owe their\r\ninstruction indirectly to West Point.\r\n\r\nTo say that no course of military instruction can make a pupil a\r\nmilitary genius, can create in him that rare quality that takes in at a\r\nglance, almost by intuition, the relative strength of great masses\r\nopposed to each other, and that power of combination which can bring an\r\ninferior force always in greater number upon the severed portions of a\r\nsuperior force, is very true. To discard military education on that\r\naccount would be like shutting up the schools and colleges because they\r\ncan not turn out Miltons and Burkes and Websters. Education does not\r\ncreate, it develops and enlarges and inspires and elevates. It will make\r\nthe perfect flower, the majestic tree, from the little seed; but it must\r\nhave the seed. And what I desire is that the Academy at West Point\r\nshould have the best seed; that its great resources, its careful\r\nculture, its scientific appliances, should not be wasted on second-rate\r\nmaterial. The Academy has never had a fair chance; the country has not\r\nhad a fair chance; the boys have not had a fair chance. This is what I\r\nwant them all to have, and especially the country. I desire that the\r\nAcademy shall begin, as it goes on, upon the competitive principle. As\r\nall its standing, all its honors, are won by competition, so should the\r\noriginal right to compete for them be won. I would give all the youth of\r\nthe country a fair chance; and, more desirable than that, I would give\r\nthe country a fair chance for all its youth. I would have the Academy\r\nfilled up by those young men who, upon examination by competent judges,\r\nshould be found most likely to render the best service to the country;\r\nto make the best officers; whose qualifications, physical, intellectual,\r\nand moral, whose tastes and habits, should seem to best fit them for\r\nmilitary life.\r\n\r\nBut, it is objected, no such examination would be infallible. Of course\r\nit would not be. No human judgment is infallible. Our deliberations are\r\nnot infallible; but therefore shall we not deliberate? The decisions of\r\nthe Supreme Court are not infallible; therefore shall we abolish the\r\ncourt?\r\n\r\nA SENATOR. The Senator from New Hampshire would say yes.\r\n\r\nMR. ANTHONY. I know the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. HALE] would say\r\n“Yes.” He would abolish both the Academy and the Court, and I can well\r\nsuppose that the policy which would abolish the one might abolish the\r\nother. But although such an examination would not be infallible, it\r\nwould, if properly organized and properly conducted, accomplish much\r\ntoward the reform which all admit to be desirable, if it be practicable.\r\nIt can not be doubted that the young men who would come out best from\r\nsuch a trial would, as a body, be superior to those who are selected\r\nupon mere personal preferences, and these preferences generally not for\r\nthemselves, but for their parents; not for their own qualifications, but\r\nas a recognition of the political services of their fathers.\r\n\r\nBut, again, it was objected when I made this proposition a year ago that\r\nit was not equal; because, in giving to any given place of examination,\r\nsome young men would have further to travel than others! If this\r\nobjection had not been gravely made by men for whom I have the highest\r\nrespect I should be tempted to call it puerile. A boy asks the privilege\r\nof going a hundred miles to the place of examination, and is told that\r\nhe can not have it because another boy will have to go two hundred\r\nmiles, and another but fifty, and it is not equal! The fact that either\r\nof them would go five hundred miles on foot for the opportunity of\r\ncompetition is not taken into the account. On the same principle our\r\nelections are not equal, for one man must travel further than another to\r\nreach the polls. For a boy who can not obtain the means to travel from\r\nhis home to the place of examination--and there will be very few such of\r\nthose who would be likely to pass high in the examination--the plan\r\nproposed would be no worse, certainly, than the present system; for\r\nthose who have the means the difference in travel is too small an item\r\nto enter into the account.\r\n\r\nNo plan can be made perfectly equal. Shall we therefore refuse to make a\r\nlarge advance toward equality? Certainly the system which invites a\r\ncompetition from all who are in a condition to avail themselves of it is\r\nmore equal than that which excludes all competition. But although\r\nequality in the advantages of the Academy is very desirable, and\r\nalthough the amendment proposed would be a long step in that direction,\r\nit is not for that reason that I urge it. It is not to give all the\r\nyoung men an equal chance for the Academy, it is to give the Academy a\r\nchance for the best young men; and although even under this system the\r\nbest young men will often fail of success, it can not be doubted that\r\nmany more of them will enter the service than under the present system.\r\n\r\nNor will the advantages of this competition be confined to those who\r\nreach the prize for which so many will struggle. An incalculable\r\nalthough an incidental benefit will accrue to the thousands whose\r\nyouthful hearts will be stirred by an honorable ambition, and who will\r\ncultivate their minds by liberal studies and develop their physical\r\npower by manly exercises in the struggle upon which the humblest may\r\nenter, and in which the proudest can obtain only what he fairly earns.\r\nUnder the present system the Academy wastes full half its strength upon\r\nboys who never ought to be admitted, and whose natural incapacity\r\nderives but little benefit from the partial training that they receive\r\nthere. Under the system proposed, the Academy would exert its influence\r\nupon thousands of the brightest and most aspiring boys all over the\r\ncountry, stimulating them to the pursuit of such studies and to the\r\nformation of such habits as, if they fail to carry them to West Point,\r\nwill help to conduct them to usefulness and honor in whatever path of\r\nlife they may choose.\r\n\r\nBut, again, we are met with the objection that this proposition is\r\nimpracticable, that it looks very well on paper, but that it can not be\r\ncarried into effect. Let us see. It is quite safe to conclude that what\r\nhas been done can be done, and that what wise and judicious people do,\r\nand persist in doing after experiment, is proper to be done. What is the\r\nmost warlike nation of Europe? What nation of Europe has carried\r\nmilitary science to the highest degree? What nation of Europe has the\r\ngreatest genius for organization? You will say the French. Let us see\r\nwhat is their system. I read from the report of the Commission appointed\r\nby Congress in 1860 to visit the Military Academy at West Point, and\r\nreport upon the system of instruction; a commission of which you, Mr.\r\nPresident, [Mr. FOOT,] were a member:\r\n\r\n  Among the European systems of military education that of France is\r\npreëminent. The stimulating principle of competition extends throughout\r\nthe whole system; it exists in the appointment of the student, in his\r\nprogress through the preliminary schools, in his transfer to the higher\r\nschools, in his promotion to the Army, and in his advancement in his\r\nsubsequent career. The distinguishing features of the French system are\r\nthus described by the British commissioners.\r\n\r\n  “1. The proportion, founded apparently upon principle, which officers\r\neducated in military schools are made to bear to those promoted for\r\nservice from the ranks. 2. The mature age at which military education\r\nbegins. 3. The system of thorough competition on which it is founded.\r\n4. The extensive State assistance afforded to successful candidates for\r\nentrance into military schools whenever their circumstances require it.\r\n* * * * * *\r\n\r\n  Admission to the military schools of France can only be gained through\r\na public competitive examination by those who have received the degree\r\nof bachelor of science from the lycées or public schools, and from the\r\norphan school of La Flèche.\r\n\r\n  A powerful influence has thus been exercised upon the character of\r\neducation in France. The importance of certain studies has been\r\ngradually reduced, while those of a scientific character, entering more\r\ndirectly into the pursuits of life, have been constantly elevated.\r\n\r\n  The two great elementary military schools are the School of St. Cyr\r\nand the Polytechnic School. These, as well as the other military\r\nschools, are under the charge of the Minister of War, with whom the\r\nauthorities of the schools are in direct communication. Commissions in\r\nthe infantry, cavalry, and marines can only be obtained by service in\r\nthe ranks of the army, or by passing successfully through the School of\r\nSt. Cyr, admission to which is gained by the competitive examination\r\nalready referred to.”\r\n\r\nAgain, the Commission say, speaking of the School of St. Cyr:\r\n\r\n  The admission is by competitive examination, open to all youths,\r\nFrench by birth or by naturalization, who, on the 1st of January\r\npreceding their candidature, were not less than sixteen and not more\r\nthan twenty years old. To this examination are also admitted soldiers in\r\nthe ranks between twenty and twenty-five years, who, at the date of its\r\ncommencement, have been actually in service in their regiments for two\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n  A board of examiners passes through France once every year, and\r\nexamines all who present themselves having the prescribed\r\nqualifications.\r\n\r\n  A list of such candidates as are found eligible for admission to St.\r\nCyr is submitted to the Minister of War. The number of vacancies has\r\nalready been determined, and the candidates admitted are taken in the\r\norder of merit.\r\n\r\n  Twenty-seven, or sometimes a greater number, are annually, at the\r\nclose of their second year of study, placed in competition with\r\ntwenty-five candidates from the second lieutenants belonging to the\r\narmy, if so many are forthcoming, for admission to the Staff School of\r\nParis. This advantage is one object which serves as a stimulus to\r\nexertion, the permission being given according to rank in the\r\nclassification by order of merit.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Polytechnic School, the Commission say:\r\n\r\n  Admission to the School is, and has been since its first commencement\r\nin 1794, obtained by competition in a general examination, held yearly,\r\nand open to all. Every French youth between the ages of sixteen and\r\ntwenty (or if in the army up to the age of twenty-five) may offer\r\nhimself as a candidate.\r\n\r\nThis is the system which was organized by Carnot and adopted and\r\nextended by Napoleon. Under this system the French army has attained its\r\nperfection of organization, its high discipline, its science, its dash,\r\nand its efficiency.\r\n\r\nBut not the French alone have adopted the competitive system. In\r\nEngland, all whose traditions are aristocratical, where promotion in the\r\narmy has so long been made by patronage and by purchase, the sturdy\r\ncommon sense of the nation has pushed away the obstructions that have\r\nblocked up the avenues to the army, and have opened them to merit, come\r\nfrom what quarter it may. In the commencement of the Crimean war, the\r\nEnglish people were shocked at the evident inferiority of their army to\r\nthe French. Their officers did not know how to take care of their men,\r\nor how to fight them. And although in the end British pluck and British\r\npersistence vindicated themselves as they always have and always will,\r\nit was not till thousands of lives had been sacrificed that might have\r\nbeen saved under a better system. No French officer would have permitted\r\nthat memorable charge at Balaklava, which was as remarkable for the\r\nstupidity that ordered it as for the valor that executed it, and which\r\nhas been sung in verses nearly as bad as the generalship which they\r\ncelebrate. After the war, the English Government, with the practical\r\ngood sense which usually distinguishes it, came, without difficulty, to\r\nthe conclusion that merit was better than family in officering the army,\r\nand that it was more desirable to put its epaulets upon the shoulder of\r\nthose who could take care of the men and lead them properly than upon\r\nthose who could trace their descent to the Conqueror, or whose uncles\r\ncould return members of Parliament. Accordingly, the Royal Military\r\nAcademy, which had been filled, as ours is, by patronage, was thrown\r\nopen to public competition. On this subject I quote from the very\r\ninteresting and valuable report of the Visitors of the Military Academy\r\nin 1863:\r\n\r\n  The same principle was applied to appointments and promotion in the\r\nnew regiments called for by the exigencies of the great war in which\r\nEngland found herself engaged.\r\n\r\n  Subjects, time, and place of examination were officially made known\r\nthroughout the kingdom, and commissions to conduct the examinations were\r\nappointed, composed of men of good common sense, military officers, and\r\neminent practical teachers and educators. The results, as stated in a\r\ndebate in Parliament five years later, on extending this principle to\r\nall public schools, and all appointments and promotions in every\r\ndepartment of the public service, were as follows: in the competitive\r\nexaminations for admission to the Royal Military Academy candidates from\r\nall classes of society appeared--sons of merchants, attorneys,\r\nclergymen, mechanics, and noblemen, and among the successful competitors\r\nevery class was represented. Among the number was the son of a mechanic\r\nin the arsenal at Woolwich, and the son of an earl who was at that time\r\na cabinet minister--the graduates of national schools, and the students\r\nof Eton, and other great public schools.\r\n\r\n  On this point Mr. Edward Chadwick, in a report before the National\r\nSocial Science Association, at Cambridge in 1862, says:\r\n\r\n  “Out of an average three hundred patronage-appointed cadets at the\r\nRoyal Military Academy at Woolwich, for officers of engineers and the\r\nartillery, during the five years preceding the adoption of the principle\r\nof open competition for admission to the Academy, there were fifty who\r\nwere, after long and indulgent trial and with a due regard to\r\ninfluential parents and patrons, dismissed for hopeless incapacity for\r\nthe service of those scientific corps. During the five subsequent years,\r\nwhich have been years of the open-competition principle, there has not\r\nbeen one dismissed for incapacity. Moreover, the general standard of\r\ncapacity has been advanced. An eminent professor of this university, who\r\nhas taught as well under the patronage as under the competitive system\r\nat that Academy, declares that the quality of mind of the average of the\r\ncadets has been improved by the competition, so much so that he\r\nconsiders that the present average quality of the mind of cadets there,\r\nthough the sorts of attainment are different, has been brought up to the\r\naverage of the first-class men of this (Cambridge) university, which of\r\nitself is a great gain. Another result, the opposite to that which was\r\nconfidently predicted by the opponents to the principle, has been that\r\nthe average physical power or bodily strength, instead of being\r\ndiminished, is advanced beyond the average of their predecessors.”\r\n\r\nI read this also from the same report:\r\n\r\n  Another result of immense importance to the educational interests of\r\nGreat Britain has followed the introduction of these open competitive\r\nexaminations for appointments to the military and naval schools, to the\r\nEast India service, as well as to fill vacancies in the principal\r\nclerkships in the war, admiralty, ordnance, and home departments of the\r\nGovernment. A stimulus of the most healthy and powerful kind, worth more\r\nthan millions of pecuniary endowment, has been given to all the great\r\nschools of the country, including the universities of England, Scotland,\r\nand Ireland. As soon as it was known that candidates, graduates of\r\nTrinity College, Dublin, had succeeded over competitors from Oxford and\r\nEdinburg in obtaining valuable appointments in the East India service,\r\nthe professors in the latter universities began to look to their\r\nlaurels. As soon as it was known to the master of any important school\r\nthat some of his leading pupils might compete in these examinations, and\r\nthat his own reputation as a teacher depended in a measure on the\r\nsuccess or failure of these pupils, he had a new motive to impart the\r\nmost vigorous and thorough training.\r\n\r\nSuch has been the result in France and in England. We are not without\r\nexamples at home. The competitive system has been tried in repeated\r\ninstances here in the appointments both to the Military and the Naval\r\nAcademy. Several Representatives in Congress, with a conscientious sense\r\nof the responsibility resting upon them, have given their patronage to\r\nthe result of general competition, among them the gentleman who so ably\r\nrepresented, in the last Congress, the district in which I live. The\r\nresults have been most satisfactory. Here, again, I will quote from the\r\nreport of the Board of Visitors for 1863:\r\n\r\n  The principle itself, of selection by merit, either in the mode of\r\npublic examination or of careful and searching inquiry by competent and\r\nimpartial educators designated for this purpose by the parties to whom\r\ncustom, and not law, had assigned the grave responsibility of nominating\r\ncandidates, has been voluntarily applied in several Congressional\r\ndistricts. Not a cadet known to have been thus selected and appointed\r\nhas ever broken down from want of vigor of body or mind, or failed to\r\nreach and maintain an honorable position on the merit-roll of the\r\nAcademy; and to this careful selection by those who felt the\r\nresponsibility of the privilege accorded to them is the country indebted\r\nfor its most eminent and useful officers.\r\n\r\nThe same report makes some observations on another point:\r\n\r\n  To the objection that selection by public competitive examination will\r\ninvolve expense, we reply that any expense which will do away with the\r\nprejudices against the Academy, which the present system of patronage\r\nhas done so much directly and indirectly to evoke and foster, and which\r\nwill, at the same time, exclude incompetent and secure the services of\r\nvigorous, talented, well-trained officers for every arm of the service,\r\nwill be well incurred. But in our opinion there will be no more expense\r\nin selecting and educating a given number of cadets on this plan than on\r\nthe present. The two thousand cadets who were appointed by patronage and\r\nfailed to graduate, cost the Government, directly and indirectly, each\r\nyear a much larger sum than it would have taken to have excluded them in\r\nadvance from the institution by competitive examination and filling\r\ntheir places by better men; and their exclusion by substituting better\r\nmaterial would have been an incalculable gain to the Academy,\r\nfacilitating its discipline, increasing the value of its instruction,\r\nand giving to the Army a larger number of competent officers.\r\n\r\nEven under the despotic government of Austria the competitive system has\r\nbeen adopted for the higher places, and it has been adopted by Prussia\r\nand Italy. In Austria every subject can claim admission into the\r\nmilitary schools on payment of the cost of his instruction; and all the\r\nappointments to the staff are on the competitive system. On this subject\r\nI read from the work upon Military Education and Schools, by Hon. Henry\r\nBarnard, who stands in the very front rank of the great educators, and\r\nwho gives, to the competitive system the weight of a name which alone\r\nshould incline us strongly in its favor:\r\n\r\n  The yearly examinations, the manner in which the marks of the monthly\r\nexaminations tell on the final one, and the careful classification of\r\nthe pupils in the order of merit, reminded us of the system of the\r\nPolytechnic more than any other school we have seen. * * * *\r\n\r\n  The arrangements for the general staff-school require more remark.\r\n\r\n  In our report upon Austrian schools we have specially noticed this\r\nschool as remarkable for its thorough and open competitive character\r\nfrom first to last, and its very sensible plan of study. Admission to it\r\nis by competition, open to officers of all arms. The pupils are not\r\nunduly overburdened with work; perhaps there is even room for one or two\r\nmore subjects of importance; but what is done seems to be done\r\nthoroughly. The officers are carefully ranked on leaving the school,\r\naccording as the abilities they have displayed may be considered a\r\ncriterion of their fitness for employment on the general staff; and in\r\nthis order they enter the staff corps. The consequence is that every\r\nofficer knows distinctly, from the time that he first competes for\r\nadmission until his final examination on leaving, that the order in\r\nwhich he will enter the staff depends entirely on his own exertions and\r\nsuccess at the school. It seemed to us that this open competition\r\nproduced a spirit of confidence and energy in the students as great, if\r\nnot greater, than any we met with elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI quote from the same work in regard to the military education in\r\nSardinia:\r\n\r\n  Admission into the artillery and engineer school may be considered the\r\nreward of the most distinguished pupils of the _Accademia Militare_,\r\nwho, after spending their last year in that institution in the study of\r\nthe higher mathematics, chemistry, and architectural drawing, are\r\ntransferred for the completion of their education to the school of the\r\nartillery and engineers.\r\n\r\n  The staff-school, the formation of which dates from 1850, is chiefly\r\nfrequented by officers of the infantry and cavalry, who must be below\r\nthe age of twenty-eight years upon their entrance. It is carried on upon\r\nthe competitive final examination, the ablest entering the staff corps\r\nin that order.\r\n\r\nIn the same work Mr. Barnard characterizes the Staff-School at Vienna:\r\n\r\n  The most striking features in the system of this school, both at the\r\nentrance and throughout the course, are, that it is distinctly\r\ncompetitive, that it admits very young officers, and that while the work\r\nis considerable, the subjects for study are not numerous. In these three\r\npoints it differs considerably from the Prussian staff-school, in which\r\nthe students are generally older, and the principle of competition is\r\nnot so fully carried out. In the Austrian school the students are\r\nplaced, on entering, in the order which their entrance examination has\r\njust fixed. They are examined once a month during their stay. On leaving\r\nthe school their respective places are again determined, and they have a\r\nclaim for appointments in the staff corps in the exact order in which\r\nthey were placed on leaving the school. In Belgium, the competitive\r\nsystem is fully adopted.\r\n\r\nThe following testimony is from a report on the progress of the\r\nprinciple of competitive examination for admission into the public\r\nservice, read before Section F. Economic Science and Statistics of the\r\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science, at Leeds, September\r\n27, 1858, by Edward Chadwick:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Canon Mosely attests that the “qualifications of the whole” body\r\nof competitive candidates appeared to rise above the general “level of\r\nthe education of the country.” It is stated in evidence before the\r\ncommissioners for inquiring into the means of improving the sanitary\r\ncondition of the army, that this was most decidedly so of the whole body\r\nof competing candidates for medical appointments in the East India\r\nservice. Mr. Canon Mosely concludes his report on the last year’s\r\nexperience in the following terms: “With reference to the general scope\r\nand tendency of competitive examinations, I may perhaps be permitted the\r\nobservation, that the consciousness which success in such examinations\r\nbrings with it in early life of a power to act resolutely on a\r\ndeterminate plan, and to achieve a difficult success, contributes more\r\nthan the consciousness of talent to the formation of a manly and\r\nhonorable character, and to success on whatever career a man may enter.”\r\n\r\nThe report of the last Board of Visitors at West Point, from which I\r\nhave read, I believe has not yet been printed by Congress; I have read\r\nfrom a pamphlet copy of it printed in the Journal of Education. The\r\nBoard was composed, as it usually is, of men of high character and\r\nability. After a full and laborious examination of the whole subject,\r\nthey unanimously and earnestly recommend the adoption of the competitive\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n  If the appointments to fill and maintain the corps at this maximum\r\n[four hundred] can be selected out of the many American youths ambitious\r\nto serve their country in the Army, on the plan of an open competitive\r\nexamination in the several States, the Visitors believe that ninety out\r\nof every one hundred thus appointed will go through the whole course\r\nwith honor, and the average ability, scholarship, and good conduct of\r\nthe whole corps will equal that now reached by the first ten of each\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nWith such experience of other nations, with such examples at home,\r\nI submit that we may safely in this republican country give our young\r\nmen the privileges that are conceded in imperial France and in\r\naristocratic England; that we may safely place competition against\r\npatronage, and give to modest merit a chance with pretentious\r\nimbecility. I would go somewhat further in the competitive system.\r\nI would not have the Army or the Navy officered exclusively by the\r\ngraduates of the national Academies. If any young man, at his own\r\nexpense, and by his own study and aptitude for the profession, has\r\nfitted himself for a command in either, let the competition be open to\r\nhim equally with those who have been instructed at the public expense,\r\nand let the epaulets rest on the shoulders that are most worthy to wear\r\nthem. But I do not propose to follow the subject to this extent at\r\npresent. I shall be abundantly content if the Senate will adopt the\r\ncompetitive system, which has worked so well in other countries and so\r\nwell here as far as it has been tried, in the Military Academy.\r\n\r\nTABLE VII.--SUMMARY OF EXAMINATIONS FOR ADMISSION TO THE UNITED STATES\r\nMILITARY ACADEMY FOR FIFTEEN YEARS, FROM 1856 TO 1870, INCLUSIVE.\r\n\r\n  [Transcriber’s Note:\r\n  The following tables were printed sideways, on two pairs of facing\r\n  pages.

MONROE\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\nThe Artillery School of the United States Army at Fortress Monroe, was\r\norganized and opened April 1, 1868, under a code of regulations and\r\nprogramme of instruction drawn up by Col. William F. Barry (who was\r\nplaced in command from the start), and approved by the General of the\r\nArmy. After two years of experience the code and programme were revised,\r\nand the present system established. The class of 1868 and of 1869,\r\nconsisted, each, of twenty lieutenants of artillery, and of the whole\r\nnumber, thirty-eight were sent back to their regiments after having\r\npassed a satisfactory examination. To this number at the close of the\r\nschool year (April) 1871, sixteen more out of the class of twenty were\r\nfound qualified to return to their respective regiments; twenty more are\r\nnow in the progress of instruction, constituting together one-half of\r\nall the officers of that grade belonging to the artillery.\r\n\r\nCOURSE OF INSTRUCTION.[16]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: Report of Col. Barry, dated September 12, 1871.]\r\n\r\nThe course of theoretical instruction embraces the subjects of\r\nmathematics, ordnance, and gunnery, military engineering and surveying,\r\nmilitary history, and military, constitutional, and international law.\r\nThe method of pursuing these studies is very similar to that pursued at\r\nthe Military Academy at West Point, viz., by recitations, questions, and\r\ndemonstrations at the blackboard. In military history each officer is\r\nrequired, in addition to his regular recitations, to prepare and read\r\nbefore the class and staff of the school two essays or memoirs upon some\r\nbattle, campaign, or the military events of some epoch of peculiar\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe topics for these essays are selected by the instructor in military\r\nhistory, with the approval of the commandant and superintendent of\r\ninstruction, and are generally confined to events not prior to the last\r\ntwo decades of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe necessary maps, instruments, and apparatus for the elucidation or\r\npractical application of the various subjects of the entire range of the\r\ntheoretical course have to a considerable extent been supplied to the\r\nschool by requisitions upon the Engineer and Ordnance Departments of the\r\nArmy. They are kept in active use, and are of the greatest value.\r\n\r\nInstructions in the theoretical course is confined to the months of\r\nautumn, winter, and the early spring, except instruction in mathematics,\r\nwhich unavoidably has to be given during the months of May, June, July,\r\nand August.\r\n\r\nThe course of practical instruction is pursued, as the weather permits,\r\nthroughout the entire year, but is more closely attended to during the\r\nmonths of summer and autumn. This course consists of the service of\r\nevery species of gun, howitzer, or mortar in use in the United States\r\nmilitary service; of the use of the various kinds of projectiles and\r\nfuses; the laying of platforms; the use of plane-tables, and telemeters,\r\nfor ascertaining ranges; of mechanical manœuvres; transportation and\r\nother handling of all kinds of ordnance, and particularly of the 15-inch\r\nguns and their carriages, and of 13-inch mortars and their beds, and of\r\nother heavy material which has been adopted into the artillery of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe practical course also includes very full target practice with every\r\ndescription of ordnance; the duties of the laboratory, as far as they\r\nimmediately concern officers of artillery; and the study of and\r\nrecitation in the tactics for light and heavy artillery, and as much of\r\nthe tactics for infantry as is essential for artillery officers.\r\n\r\nGuns, carriages, ammunition, platforms, artillery machines, including\r\nhydraulic-jacks of greater or less power, and other appliances, are\r\nsupplied by requisition on the Ordnance Department in such number and\r\nvariety as may be desired. The school is compelled to be indebted to the\r\nOrdnance Department for the occasional use, when necessary, of some of\r\nits instruments and apparatus for determining initial velocities,\r\npressures, densities, etc.\r\n\r\nInstruction in the practical course is designed to be as thorough as\r\npossible, and no officer leaves the school who has not become\r\npractically familiar with the tools of his trade, and able to use them\r\nintelligently.\r\n\r\nA school for non-commissioned officers, and for such other enlisted men\r\nas may desire to avail themselves of its advantages, is also\r\nestablished. Every non-commissioned officer belonging to the five\r\ninstruction batteries is required to attend the school for one year’s\r\nfull course of instruction; all other enlisted men are permitted to\r\nattend. But their attendance upon school is entirely voluntary. Enlisted\r\nmen of good character, and belonging to batteries not stationed at the\r\npost where the Artillery School is established, are also permitted to\r\nenjoy the benefits of one year’s course of instruction at the school.\r\nSuch men, on their own application, are nominated by their battery\r\ncommanders to their regimental commanders, on whose approval they are\r\ndetached from their batteries, by orders from the head-quarters of the\r\nArmy, and directed to report themselves in person to the commanding\r\nofficer of the school. Of this last-named class of men twenty-two have\r\nundergone or are now undergoing instruction at the school.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction for the non-commissioned officers is both\r\npractical and theoretical. The practical course is pursued _pari passu_\r\nwith that of the commissioned officers, but is not carried to the same\r\nextent, being restricted to the scope of the necessary duties and\r\nrequirements of non-commissioned officers of artillery, and to the\r\naverage capacity of enlisted men of that grade in our Army.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical course of instruction for the non-commissioned officers\r\nembraces mathematics, history of the United States, geography, reading,\r\nand writing. The subject of mathematics includes the entire field of\r\narithmetic, and, for the more advanced scholars, it is carried as far as\r\nequations of the second degree in algebra. The instruction in most of\r\nthe branches is conducted as in the school for commissioned officers, by\r\nrecitations at the blackboard, and by questions.\r\n\r\nSince the commencement of the duties of the Artillery School one hundred\r\nand three enlisted men (chiefly non-commissioned officers) have gone\r\nthrough the entire course of practical and theoretical instruction for\r\none year, and have been awarded by the staff of the school engraved\r\ncertificates, signed by each of its members, setting forth that fact.\r\n\r\nThe following-named officers constitute the staff and instructors at the\r\nschool at the present date, and, with the above-stated exceptions, have\r\nbeen thus on duty since its first establishment:\r\n\r\n_Commandant._--Colonel W. F. Barry, Second Artillery.\r\n\r\n_Superintendent of Theoretical Instruction._--Lieutenant-Colonel I.\r\nRoberts, Fourth Artillery.\r\n\r\n_Superintendent of Practical Instruction._--Major G. A.

Archer.\r\n\r\nA museum of field, siege, and sea-coast artillery; specimens of primers,\r\nfuses, and projectiles; different varieties of small arms of this and\r\nother countries; instruments for inspecting cannon and projectiles, has\r\nbeen commenced by the Superintendent, as a useful aid to the course of\r\npractical and theoretical instruction in the school. It now numbers over\r\n4,000 articles.\r\n\r\nThe Artillery School has been organized and conducted thus far to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Department, and favor, with this arm of the service,\r\nwithout any special pecuniary expense to the Government by the present\r\nCommandant, Col. William F. Barry--who closes his annual Report with the\r\nremarkable paragraph:--“No special appropriation (beyond the ordinary\r\nrequirements of this Military Post) for the maintenance of this school\r\nare now needed, and none are required.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE AT LEXINGTON.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\nThe VIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE at Lexington, was established in 1839,\r\nand was organized and conducted from the start on the plan of the\r\nMilitary Academy at West Point, by Col. Francis H. Smith, a graduate of\r\nthat institution of the class of 1833, and professor there from 1834 to\r\n1836.\r\n\r\nThe State makes an annual appropriation of $15,000 for its support, on\r\nthe basis of which a certain number (usually 36) cadets are admitted\r\nwithout charge; in consideration of which they are required to teach in\r\nsome school of the State for two years after graduation. In the\r\nselection of State cadets regard is had to their capacity to profit, and\r\ninability to pay the expenses of tuition and board, and an equal\r\nrepresentation of each senatorial district. Any commissioned officer of\r\nthe militia of the State can become a student for a period not exceeding\r\nten months, and receive instruction in any or all departments of\r\nmilitary science taught therein, without charge for tuition.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction was from the start distinctly scientific, and\r\nsince its return [from Richmond where it was removed after the\r\ndestruction of its building and library, when Lexington was taken\r\npossession of by Gen. Hunter] in 1866, and its reorganization on its\r\npresent basis of a general School of Applied Science, it has become even\r\ntechnic in reference to all the chief industries and natural resources\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe origin and military character of the Institute are thus set forth by\r\nthe Superintendent in an address to the Corps of Cadets, Sept. 10, 1866:\r\n\r\n  Peculiar circumstances gave to this Institution its distinctive\r\nmilitary character. Here the State had a deposit of arms, in an arsenal,\r\nwhich had been established for many years before the organization of the\r\nInstitution, and the annuity which had been formerly given to the public\r\nguard by the State, was transferred to the Virginia Military Institute,\r\nas the basis of its support. Upon this foundation the Virginia Military\r\nInstitute was established, and as the duty imposed upon the cadet was\r\nmilitary, so military discipline and military instruction became an\r\nessential and distinctive feature in the education it supplied. Besides\r\ndaily exercises in the school of the soldier, company, and battalion in\r\n_infantry_, and of the piece and battery in _artillery_ tactics, minute\r\ninstruction is given in the class-room, upon all the theoretic branches\r\nof the military art, embracing, in addition to those enumerated,\r\n_ordnance_ and _gunnery_, _military strategy_ and _military history_,\r\nand the principles and practice of field and permanent fortifications.\r\n\r\n  It is not necessary that I should say any thing, at this time, to\r\nvindicate the completeness of the arrangements made in this institution\r\nfor theoretical and practical military education. The sanguinary\r\nconflict which has just closed has fully tested its efficiency.\r\n_One-tenth_ of the Confederate Armies was commanded by the éléves of\r\nthis school, embracing three _major generals_, thirty _brigadier\r\ngenerals_, sixty _colonels_, fifty _lieutenant colonels_, thirty\r\n_majors_, one hundred and twenty-five _captains_, between two and three\r\nhundred _lieutenants_; and the terrible results of the battles, in\r\nnumbering one hundred and twenty-five of these among the _killed_, and\r\nthree hundred and fifty among the _wounded_, show that the éléves of\r\nthis institution met the call of their country with an earnestness of\r\ndevotion which places them in most honorable distinction for their\r\nheroic defense of what they believed to be right.[17]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: Although no one institution contributed so large a\r\n    number of officers to the Confederate Armies, the Military\r\n    Institute at Frankfort, Ky., the Cadet Corps connected with the\r\n    arsenals in Norfolk, Richmond, and other Southern cities, and the\r\n    State Military Institutes in Alabama and Louisiana, furnished a\r\n    large number of subordinate officers, which facilitated the early\r\n    organization of the armed forces of the South.]\r\n\r\nWe give the organization and course of instruction from the latest\r\nCircular, issued by the Superintendent.\r\n\r\n  _Academic Staff._\r\n\r\n  _Superintendent, and Professor of Mathematics and Moral\r\nPhilosophy_--General Francis H.

SYSTEM OF INSTRUCTION AND GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n  The System of Instruction and Government is founded upon that of the\r\nUnited States Military Academy at West Point.\r\n\r\n  As soon as a young man enters the Institution, it assumes over him an\r\nentire control, and not only directs his moral and intellectual\r\neducation, but provides every thing required for his personal wants or\r\ncomfort. A Cadet, may, if his parents desire it, remain in charge of the\r\nInstitution for the entire term of four years, as the system of\r\ngovernment keeps it always in operation. The months of July and August,\r\nin each year, are devoted exclusively to Military Exercises. Furloughs\r\nare granted to those who may desire it, in turn, during this period. The\r\nCadets are lodged and boarded in the Institution, their Clothing, Books,\r\nand other supplies, being provided by the Quartermaster of the\r\nInstitute, _at cost_. The sick are under the special care of the\r\nSurgeon, with Hospital and other facilities for nursing.\r\n\r\n  The energy, system, subordination, and self-reliance which the\r\nmilitary government of the Institute cultivates, give a practical\r\ncharacter to the education which it supplies. The high reputation which\r\nits Alumni have established for the School is the evidence of its value.\r\n\r\n  V. DEGREES.\r\n\r\n  A Diploma, signed by the Governor of Virginia and by the Visitors and\r\nFaculty, is awarded to all Cadets who may pass approved examinations on\r\nall the studies of the Academic School, with the title of “_Graduate of\r\nthe Virginia Military Institute_.” A like Diploma is awarded to all who\r\nmay complete the course prescribed for either of the _Special Schools of\r\nApplied Science_, with the title of “_Graduate_” in such school.\r\n\r\nMILITARY TACTICS IN STATE SCHOOLS OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nIn the Act of Congress (July, 1862) making grants of public lands to the\r\nseveral States for the endowment of State Schools of Agriculture and the\r\nMechanic Arts, it is provided that military tactics shall be included in\r\ntheir schemes of instruction; and by an Act of March, 1869, the\r\nPresident is authorized to detail an army officer to each institution,\r\nto instruct in such tactics. On these two provisions, with further\r\ncooperative legislation, State and National, a system of military\r\ninstruction can be gradually developed, which, for economy, efficiency,\r\nand uniformity, will meet all the conditions of a national armament, and\r\ncompare favorably, as against foreign invasion or domestic insurrection,\r\nwith that of Switzerland or Prussia. Thus far the subject has received\r\nonly slight attention, and the connection of these departments with the\r\nState militia, or volunteer companies, or the appointment of cadets to\r\nour national military schools or to vacancies in the army, has not been\r\ndiscussed. We state briefly what is attempted in a few of these schools:\r\n\r\nCORNELL UNIVERSITY AT ITHACA, N.Y.\r\n\r\nIn Cornell University (to which the United States Land Grant of 989,000\r\nacres of land was assigned by the Legislature of New York, and which Mr.\r\nEzra Cornell has endowed with the sum of $525,000, securely invested and\r\ndrawing interest at seven per cent.), the military tactics is\r\nincorporated into the general organization of the students, and made the\r\nbasis of the College of Military Science. (1.) Attendance on military\r\nexercises is made obligatory on every able-bodied student; and for this\r\npurpose the whole number is organized into a military corps--arms and\r\nequipments being furnished by the State--under the Military Professor,\r\nwho has the title of Commandant, and is aided in his duties by a staff,\r\nselected in view of military aptitude, general deportment, and\r\nproficiency in studies. (2.) All students are required to observe and\r\nconform to such regulations as may, from time to time, be promulgated by\r\nthe Commandant; provide themselves with the university cap for ordinary\r\nwear, and with the blouse or fatigue cap for parade; and are held to\r\nstrict accountability for the proper use of the arms and other property\r\nissued to them. (3.) The practical instruction for all students embraces\r\ninfantry and artillery tactics, and special exercises with the sabre,\r\nsword, and bayonet; and (4.) for those who elect, a military course\r\nconsisting of (a.) _Military Engineering_, (b.) _the Art of War_, and\r\n(c.) _Military Law_. At the close of each year, after the graduating\r\nexercises, the Faculty will recommend to the Governor of the State a\r\nlist (not exceeding one in every ten of such graduates), distinguished\r\nfor general proficiency in any one of the complete University courses,\r\nspecial attainments in military science, expertness in military\r\nexercises, and of good moral character and of sound health, with a\r\nrequest to transmit the same to the President of the United States for\r\nhis consideration in making appointments for positions in which such\r\nqualifications are demanded.\r\n\r\nSTATE AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE AT AMHERST, MASS.\r\n\r\nThe Military features of the Course of Study were originally\r\nadministered by Capt. Henry E. Alvord, of the United States Army, who\r\nhad been specially charged with this instruction in the Military\r\nInstitute and University at Norwich, Vt. The specifications are:\r\n\r\n  FRESHMAN YEAR.--_First Term_--Military Drill; Infantry Tactics; School\r\nof the Soldier; _Second Term_--Do.; and School of the Company and Manual\r\nof Arms. _Third Term_--Do.; and School of the Company and Battalion.\r\n\r\n  SOPHOMORE YEAR.--_First Term_--Military Drill; Infantry Tactics;\r\nManual of the Bayonet and Instruction in duty as Skirmishers. _Second\r\nTerm_--Do.; and Bayonet Exercise. _Third Term_--Do.; and Skirmish and\r\nBattalion Drill; Guard Duty; and Forms of Parade and Review.\r\n\r\n  JUNIOR YEAR.--_Third Term_--Military Drill; Artillery Tactics; School\r\nof the Piece. _Second Term_--Do.; and Artillery and Cavalry Tactics;\r\nManual of the Sabre; School of the Trooper dismounted; Instruction in\r\nHeavy Artillery Tactics and Gunnery. _Third Term_--Do.; School of the\r\nSection; Infantry Tactics; Battalion Drill.\r\n\r\n  SENIOR YEAR.--_First Term_--Military Drill and Cavalry, Artillery and\r\nInfantry Tactics; Duty as Drill Masters and Officers in Infantry and\r\nArtillery Drill; Theoretical Instruction in Cavalry Tactics, and the\r\norganization and uses of Cavalry. _Second Term_--Military Drill and\r\nCavalry Tactics; Sabre Exercise. _Third Term_--Military Drill; Target\r\nPractice; Sword Play: and General Drill.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Examination for 1870 report as follows:\r\n\r\n  Your Committee can not refrain from alluding to the interest which all\r\nthe young men take in the drills, the evident beneficial effect upon\r\ntheir bearing and health, and the value of the accomplished soldiers and\r\nofficers thus, made for the future service of the Commonwealth, in the\r\nevent of another call to send forth her sons for herself or the nation.\r\nWere no other result accomplished by this institution, the money of the\r\nCommonwealth could be no more judiciously expended, and yet this is but\r\nan incident to the regular course.\r\n\r\n  The Principal, Col. Clark, writes: “We have a fine hall for in-door\r\nexercise, and are furnished by the State with cannon, breech-loading\r\nrifles, sabres, &c., and consider our course a decided success. Our\r\ngraduates are able to act as officers in infantry and artillery\r\nregiments, and I believe our system, as we are organized and taught by a\r\nWest Point graduate, a most excellent and economical substitute for the\r\nordinary militia system.”\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\nThe Louisiana State University was founded as “a State Seminary of\r\nLearning and Military Academy” by the Legislature in 1855, near\r\nAlexandria, in the Parish of Rapides, on endowments of land made by the\r\nGeneral Government at different times, from 1806 to 1827, for\r\nestablishing “a Seminary of Learning.” It was opened for the reception\r\nof students, January 2, 1860, and organized on a military basis, under\r\nthe superintendence of Col. W. T. Sherman (now General-in-Chief, United\r\nStates Army), who resigned his position, February 2, 1861, on the\r\nhostile demonstration of the State of Louisiana against the authority of\r\nthe United States. The instruction of the institution continued under\r\nCol. W. E. M. Linfield, till April 22, 1863, when its operations were\r\nclosed by the disasters of the War, to be reopened on the first of\r\nOctober, 1865, only to be closed again by the utter destruction of its\r\nextensive buildings by fire on the 15th of October, 1869. On the 1st of\r\nNovember following, its exercises were resumed at Baton Rouge, in the\r\nextensive building of the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, which was placed\r\ntemporarily for the occupancy of the classes, and a portion of the\r\nstudents. The session of 1871, under the superintendence of Col. D. F.\r\nBoyd, closed with 217 matriculated Cadets, of whom 128 were admitted on\r\nthe State Cadet warrants.\r\n\r\nThe Law of March 16, 1870, relative to the appointment of Beneficiary\r\nCadets, provides that each parish shall delegate two, and the city of\r\nNew Orleans, by its Board of School Directors, twenty cadets, to be\r\nselected from the members of the highest class in the public school of\r\nsuch parishes and city, distinguished for their scholarship and good\r\nconduct, and whose parents may not be able to provide for their\r\nnecessary expenses for tuition and maintenance at the State Seminary;\r\nand at the expiration of their residence at the University which can not\r\nexceed four years, these Beneficiary Cadets are required to teach school\r\nwithin the State for two years, on penalty of default to the amount of\r\nthe sum paid by the State.\r\n\r\nWABASH COLLEGE, CRAWFORDSVILLE, INDIANA.\r\n\r\nBy arrangement with the Trustees of Wabash College, the Legislature of\r\nIndiana has authorized the County Commissioners of each county to\r\nappoint one person to receive the advantages of the institution for five\r\nyears, free of tuition, in consideration of a portion of the State’s\r\nquota of the United States Land Grant, for agricultural and mechanical\r\nArts Colleges; and to meet the requirements of the law of Congress, the\r\ncollege has established a Scientific Course, and under the\r\nsuperintendence of a Professor of Military Science, daily instruction in\r\nTactics and Gymnastics is given to the students by divisions with a\r\nweekly drill of all, as a battalion. The _College Courant_ thus notices\r\nthe new hall for Gymnastics and Tactics:\r\n\r\n  The physical culture of this institution is under the charge of the\r\nChair of Military Science, and for the purpose of this culture a\r\nbuilding has been erected which is more comprehensive than usual in\r\ngymnasiums, and is quite unique in some particulars. Work was commenced\r\nlast August, and in fifty days the roof was receiving the slate. The\r\nbuilding presents the form of a cross, of equal members, and the ground\r\nservice of seven thousand five hundred feet, is thus divided: A marching\r\nand running course, of three hundred feet, twelve feet wide, and\r\nseventeen feet high; a gymnasium sixty feet by twenty-six, and\r\ntwenty-four feet high, ventilated and lighted by a central tower fifty\r\nfeet in height; an armory and gun-room, for care of small arms and\r\nartillery; and a room for fencing, boxing, quoits and other manly\r\nexercises. In the four transepts above, are topographical room, model\r\nroom; reading room, for maps, charts, etc., and bath rooms. All these,\r\nthrough interior glass fronts, furnish a full view of the Exercise Hall,\r\nwithin and below. The small-arms used are the “light, cadet,\r\nbreech-loading rifle,” similar to those last issued to the Military\r\nAcademy at West Point, and were manufactured by the United States at the\r\nSpringfield Arsenal for the use of students receiving their instruction.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\nThe University of the State of California has a Military Department to\r\nmeet the requirements of the Act of Congress, under the directions\r\n(1871) of Professor (General) Welcker and Assistant Professor F. Soulé,\r\ngraduates of the West Point Academy. The Adjutant General (Thos. N.\r\nCazneau) of the State in his Report to the Governor, dated September 1,\r\n1870, remarks:\r\n\r\n  The gratifying success with which the military department of the State\r\nUniversity has been conducted is worthy of special notice, and I am\r\nhappy to announce that perfect discipline and a high state of\r\nproficiency pervade the department of military study at that\r\ninstitution. The cadets were incorporated with the National Guard of the\r\nState by Act of the last legislature, and have been formed into four\r\ncompanies of infantry, and instructed most fully and perfectly in that\r\nbranch of military service. A personal inspection of the battalion\r\nenables me to speak of its condition with confidence. I find both\r\nofficers and cadets thoroughly up to the requirements of the infantry\r\nsoldier, perfect in carriage, most proficient in the use of arms, steady\r\nin marching and all company formations, and, in the manœuvres of the\r\nbattalion, challenging an admiration worthy to be elicited by a veteran\r\nsoldiery. Their _ensemble_ is striking, and the effect of a thorough\r\nmilitary training upon the young gentlemen of the University is largely\r\nmanifested in their erect and graceful personal appearance and\r\nmovements, apparent not only when upon duty but in their ordinary walks\r\nof every-day occupation; while the gentlemanly and high-toned courtesy\r\nthat pervades the whole body may not unjustly be attributed, in a large\r\ndegree, to their military studies and military habits. The young\r\nofficers evince excellent characteristics of command, great dignity of\r\ndeportment and admirable ability in imparting instruction. I can not too\r\nhighly commend to your attention the whole military condition of the\r\ncadets of the State University, and to ask for them your fostering care\r\nand encouragement, and that of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThere are several colleges in California in which military instruction\r\nis introduced; prominent among them is St. Augustine College at Benicia,\r\nand McClure’s Academy at Oakland. At each there are about 100 boys,\r\nfully equipped and drilled as infantry soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUAL AND CORPORATE INSTITUTIONS FOR MILITARY INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nALDEN PARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\nAlden Partridge, Captain in the United States Corps of Engineers,\r\nProfessor and Superintendent of the Military Academy at West Point, and\r\nthe Founder of a class of institutions in which the military element is\r\nrecognized and provided for as an essential part of the training of the\r\nAmerican citizen, was born at Norwich in Vermont, on the 12th of\r\nJanuary, 1785. His father was a farmer, in independent circumstances,\r\nserved in the war of the Revolution, and took part in the capture of\r\nBurgoyne and his army at Saratoga. He brought up his son in the New\r\nEngland fashion, at such district school as the times and the country\r\nafforded in the winter, and at all sorts of work about the house and on\r\nthe farm at other seasons, until he was sixteen years of age, when,\r\nbeing of studious turn, and fond of reading, he was allowed to fit for\r\ncollege, and entered Dartmouth in August, 1802. We have no knowledge of\r\nhis studies in college, but it is presumed that his predilections were\r\nfor the mathematics, and from the lateness with which he commenced his\r\nLatin and his subsequent declarations, his aversion was for the\r\nlanguages. Before completing his collegiate course he received the\r\nappointment of cadet[20] in the regiment of artillerists in the United\r\nStates service, with orders to repair to West Point, and report himself\r\nto the commanding officer of the Military Academy at that place.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: A _Cadet_ in the military organization of the Army\r\n    denoted a junior officer between the grade of lieutenant and\r\n    sergeant, and was introduced from the French service. An Act of\r\n    Congress, passed May 7th, 1794, provided for a Corps of\r\n    Artillerists and Engineers, to consist of four battalions, to each\r\n    of which eight _cadets_ were to be attached, and authorized the\r\n    Secretary of War to procure at the public expense the necessary\r\n    books, instruments and apparatus for the use and benefit of said\r\n    corps. In 1798, an additional regiment of Artillerists and\r\n    Engineers was raised, increasing the number of Cadets to\r\n    fifty-six. In 1798, the President was authorized to appoint four\r\n    teachers of the Arts and Sciences necessary to Artillerists and\r\n    Engineers. No appointment was made till 1801, and in 1802, the\r\n    Military Academy was established at West Point, where the corps of\r\n    Engineers was directed to repair with fifty Cadets, and the Senior\r\n    Officer of the Corps was constituted Superintendent. Col. Williams\r\n    was then Senior Officer of Engineers, and became, _ex-officio_,\r\n    Superintendent, and continued such until 1812.]\r\n\r\nThe Military Academy at the time Cadet Partridge arrived at West Point\r\nwas very inadequately equipped with the men and material aids of\r\ninstruction, although the two teachers appointed were abundantly capable\r\nin their respective departments. Jared Mansfield, especially, the\r\nteacher of natural philosophy, had won such reputation in mathematical\r\nstudies that he received his commission as a captain of engineers from\r\nMr. Jefferson for the very purpose of becoming a teacher at West Point,\r\nwhich he did by appointment in 1802, although in reality he did not\r\nperform his duties regularly, and then only for one year, having been,\r\nin 1808, appointed by President Jefferson to the responsible post of\r\nSurveyor-General of the North-western territory. Such instruction as was\r\ngiven was received by Cadet Partridge in 1806, and in July of that year,\r\nhe was transferred to the Corps of Engineers, and in October,\r\ncommissioned as first lieutenant. In November, 1806, he was appointed\r\nassistant professor of mathematics, Fedinand K. Hassler, a little later,\r\nhaving been made Professor in place of Capt. Barron, retired. From Prof.\r\nHassler, he received great help in his mathematical studies, as he\r\nafterwards repeatedly acknowledged. In 1808, Prof. Partridge was called\r\nto act in place of the Superintendent in the absence of Col. Williams,\r\nand continued to do so, with brief intervals, until January, 1815, when\r\nhe was appointed to the office which he filled till March, 1816. In\r\n1809, Mr. Hassler resigned the professorship of mathematics, and the\r\ninstruction before given by him devolved on his assistant, Mr.\r\nPartridge. In 1810, he succeeded, after repeated applications to the\r\nSecretary of War, in obtaining two field pieces, for practical\r\ninstruction of the Cadets as Artillerists.\r\n\r\nIn 1812, the Academy was re-organized, and was made to consist of the\r\nCorps of Engineers and the following Professors, in addition to the\r\nteachers of the French language and drawing, viz.: “one professor of\r\nnatural and experimental philosophy; one professor of mathematics; and\r\none professor of the art of engineering; each professor to have an\r\nassistant taken from the most prominent of the Officers or Cadets.” The\r\nnumber of Cadets was increased to two hundred and fifty, and were\r\ndirected to be arranged into companies of non-commissioned officers and\r\nprivates, according to the directions of the commandant of Engineers,\r\nand be officered from that corps, “for the purposes of military\r\ninstruction, in all the duties of a private, non-commissioned officer,\r\nand officer, and to be encamped at least three months of each year, and\r\ntaught all the duties incident to a regular camp.” The age of admission\r\nwas fixed, the minimum at fourteen, and maximum at twenty-one, and\r\npreliminary knowledge to be well versed in reading, writing, and\r\narithmetic. It was further provided that any Cadet who shall receive a\r\nregular degree from the Academical Staff, after going through all the\r\nclasses, shall be considered among the candidates for a commission in\r\nany corps, according to the duties he may be judged competent to\r\nperform. The sum of $25,000 was appropriated towards the buildings,\r\nlibrary, implements, &c. On this broad basis the Academy was\r\nprogressively enlarged to its present capabilities of usefulness.\r\n\r\nUnder the new arrangement of 1812, Mr. Partridge was appointed professor\r\nof mathematics, with the pay and emoluments of a major, which\r\nappointment was soon after, at the request of the Secretary of War,\r\nexchanged for that of professor of engineering, it being found more\r\ndifficult to fill the latter post than the former. The duties of this\r\nprofessorship he continued to discharge from September 1, 1813, till\r\nDecember 31, 1816.\r\n\r\nIn 1808, Capt. Partridge was ordered by Col. Williams to take charge of\r\nthe internal direction and control of the Military Academy as\r\nSuperintendent, which duties he discharged until January 3, 1815, when,\r\nby regulations of that date, he was made the permanent Superintendent,\r\nwhich post he held-till November 25th, 1816, and was finally relieved on\r\nthe 13th of January, 1817.\r\n\r\nBy the regulation of January 3, 1815, the commandant of the Corps of\r\nEngineers was constituted _Inspector_ of the Academy, and made\r\nresponsible for instruction, and to report to the Department of War. Out\r\nof this appointment, and the instructions relating thereto, grew a\r\ndifference of opinion, which resulted in the final withdrawal of Capt.\r\nPartridge from the institution, the resignation of his commission in the\r\nmilitary service of the United States, and his subsequent devotion to\r\nthe dissemination by lectures and personal efforts of the views which he\r\nhad formed of the education required by the American citizen, and the\r\nestablishment of institutions in which these views could be carried out.\r\n\r\nAfter resigning his commission in the military service of the United\r\nStates, Capt. Partridge was engaged, in the summer of 1818, as military\r\ninstructor to a volunteer corps, and in giving a course of lectures on\r\nfortifications and other branches of military science to a class of\r\nofficers and citizens in the city of New York. The views which he then\r\npresented on the best means of national defense were in advance of the\r\n“piping times of peace” in 1818, but have been since demanded to be\r\neminently sound and practical by the terrible experience of 1861-1862.\r\n\r\nHis chief reliance for national defense was in the _military habits_ of\r\nthe great body of the American people--organized into suitable militia\r\ndepartments corresponding in the main to the limits of the several\r\nstates, officered by men of the right capacity, scientific education,\r\nand military training. The officers were required to assemble annually\r\nat stated periods, either in camps or rendezvous, at some central point\r\nin the department, to receive instruction from a few competent teachers\r\nof the military art. We give the plan in his own language as published\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\n  I. Let the United States be divided into military departments, say\r\nthirty in number; each of those departments to be wholly comprised\r\nwithin the same state, whenever this can be done.\r\n\r\n  II. To each of those departments let there be attached a military\r\ninstructor, (under the authority of the United States,) who should\r\nreceive the pay and emoluments of a colonel of infantry, and have the\r\nbrevet-rank of a brigadier-general. These instructors to be gentlemen of\r\nestablished character and reputation, and who have received a regular\r\nscientific military education.\r\n\r\n  III. Let the officers of each brigade of militia in the United States\r\nbe required to assemble annually at stated periods, either in camp or\r\nrendezvous at some central point in the brigade, there to remain six\r\ndays, for the purpose of military instruction. Let each instructor\r\nattend in succession at the several camps or places of rendezvous in his\r\ndepartment, and devote himself assiduously to the instruction of the\r\nofficers there assembled. One portion of the day might be devoted to\r\npractical drills, and field evolutions--also to the turning off,\r\nmounting, and relieving guards and sentinels, while the remainder could\r\nbe most usefully employed in explaining and illustrating the principles\r\nof tactics generally, of artillery, of permanent and field\r\nfortification, the duties of troops in camp and in garrison, and such\r\nother branches as time and circumstances might permit, by means of\r\nfamiliar explanatory lectures.\r\n\r\n  IV. Let each officer receive from the government a reasonable\r\nallowance for his expenses while attending the instruction, and also\r\nwhile going to, and returning from, the camp or rendezvous.\r\n\r\n  Some of the principal advantages that would result from the adoption\r\nof the foregoing plan, I conceive would be as follows; viz.:--\r\n\r\n  1. The same system of tactics and discipline would pervade the whole\r\nmass of the militia--the instructors being imperatively required to\r\nadhere to one system. This would be a very important advantage.\r\n\r\n  2. By this means the country, in the course of a few years, would be\r\nfurnished with a well organized military force, of at least one million\r\nof men, composed of the best materials in the world for soldiers; the\r\nwhole of which, the officers having been regularly and correctly\r\ninstructed, might be rendered, in the course of a few weeks, after being\r\ncalled into service, perfectly competent to the efficient discharge of\r\nall the duties of the field. This assertion is not founded upon\r\nconjecture. An experience of nearly fifteen years in military\r\ninstruction, has convinced me, that any of our regiments of militia, in\r\ntheir present state of discipline, if brought into the field and placed\r\nunder competent officers, could, by three weeks instruction, be prepared\r\nfor discharging all the duties of regular troops. The instruction, then,\r\nin time of peace, of the officers, becomes an object of great\r\nimportance;--that of the privates is of secondary consideration. There\r\nis no difficulty in making soldiers, when officers understand their\r\nduty, and are disposed to perform it.\r\n\r\n  It may perhaps be objected to the foregoing plan, that the time\r\nproposed for the officers to remain in camp or rendezvous is too limited\r\nto admit of their deriving much advantage therefrom. In answer to this I\r\nwill observe, that a due share of experience in this species of\r\ninstruction, has fully convinced me, that they would acquire more\r\ncorrect military information in six days, under a competent and\r\nsystematic instructor, than they usually acquire under the present\r\nsystem, during the whole period from eighteen to forty-five years of\r\nage; and that, after attending two or three similar courses, the great\r\nbody of them would be perfectly competent to the correct, efficient, and\r\nuseful discharge of all the duties of the field. From the best\r\ncalculation I have been able to make, I feel confident, that the whole\r\nnecessary expense of carrying this plan into full and effective\r\noperation, would not exceed six hundred thousand dollars--it would\r\nprobably fall short of that sum. Whether the expense, then, is to be\r\nconsidered as disproportionate to the object in view, and therefore to\r\nconstitute a barrier to its accomplishment, must be decided by the sound\r\ndiscretion of the representatives of the people. It appears to me,\r\nhowever, to bear no greater ratio to it, than does a grain of sand to\r\nthe globe we inhabit. The cultivation of military science must also be\r\nviewed as of the first importance in a system of military defense for\r\nour country. The plan already detailed, is calculated for the general\r\ndissemination of practical military information throughout the\r\ncommunity, but is not adapted to the investigation of principles. This\r\ncan only be done at seminaries, where it constitutes a branch of regular\r\nattention and study; and where theory and practice can, in due\r\nproportion, be combined. At those seminaries would be formed our\r\nmilitary instructors, our engineers, and our generals; and from those,\r\nas from so many foci, would all the improvements in the military art be\r\ndiffused throughout the country.\r\n\r\nIn the lectures delivered in 1818, Capt, Partridge, in view of the\r\nInevitable disintegration by frost and moisture, and the improvements in\r\nthe science of attack, anticipated the insufficiency of permanent\r\nfortifications--of works of masonry, no matter how expensively or\r\nstrongly constructed--to the defense of our principal harbors against\r\nthe attacks of a foreign foe; his reliance was on the general diffusion\r\nof military science and training amongst the militia, on an efficient\r\nnavy, and the following plan of marine defense.\r\n\r\n  I. At the most important and exposed points on our seaboard, let one\r\nor two principal works of the most permanent kind be erected: these\r\nworks to be kept in perfect repair, to be plentifully supplied with all\r\nthe munitions of war, and the gun’s and carriages well secured from the\r\nweather by means of pent houses.\r\n\r\n  II. In the vicinity of all the most exposed and vulnerable points on\r\nthe seaboard, let spacious and permanent arsenals be constructed, in\r\nwhich, let there be deposited ample supplies of cannon, mortars, gun\r\ncarriages, materials for platforms, and other munitions of war, where\r\nthey would remain perfectly safe from the weather.\r\n\r\n  III. In case of war or threatened invasion, let temporary works,\r\neither of earth, or of wood, be constructed at all the most vulnerable\r\npoints, which could be readily furnished with cannon, gun carriages,\r\nplatforms, and all the necessary implements and munitions from the\r\narsenals in their vicinity.\r\n\r\n  IV. As soon as peace is restored, these works should be dismantled,\r\nand all their apparatus returned to the arsenals from whence it was\r\ntaken. In case of future emergencies, they could be restored, or others\r\nof the same descriptions, constructed in their places, which could be\r\nsupplied from the arsenals in the manner above stated. The efficacy in\r\nmarine defense, of works of the above description, I presume will not be\r\ndoubted by any scientific military man. Should any one, however, be\r\ndisposed to doubt it, I would beg leave to refer him to the defense of\r\nFort Moultrie, in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina, when\r\nattacked by the British shipping, during the Revolutionary war, and also\r\nto the defense made by the small fort at Stonington, Connecticut, when\r\nattacked in a similar manner during the last war.\r\n\r\n  By adopting this system, I think the following advantages would\r\nresult:--\r\n\r\n  1. A more secure defense would be obtained. By knowing the description\r\nof force we had to encounter, we should be enabled to construct our\r\ntemporary works in a manner the best calculated to repel it; and as the\r\ngun carriages, platforms, and implements, when taken from the arsenals,\r\nwould be sound and in perfect order, we might reasonably calculate these\r\nworks would make a more vigorous resistance than permanent ones, which,\r\nwith their apparatus, are in a state of partial dilapidation and decay.\r\n\r\n  2. The system would be much less expensive than the one by permanent\r\nfortification. Those temporary works could ordinarily be constructed by\r\nthe troops with very little, if any, additional expense; but in case of\r\npressing emergency, the zeal and patriotism of the people might be\r\nrelied upon with safety, to supply any amount of labor that might be\r\nnecessary, as was the case at New York in 1814. As it is not proposed\r\nthey should be retained as military stations in time of peace, the\r\nexpense of keeping them in repair would be nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1819, Capt. Partridge was engaged in the exploring\r\nsurvey of the North Eastern boundary, under the fifth article of the\r\ntreaty of Ghent. While on this survey he determined from barometrical\r\nand thermometrical observations of the altitudes of the Highlands\r\ndividing the rivers which flow northerly into the St. Lawrence, from\r\nthose which flow southerly into the Atlantic ocean; he also made a\r\nprofile of the country between several points on the St. Lawrence, and\r\ncorresponding position in the state of Maine.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, Capt. Partridge resigned his position in this survey, for the\r\npurpose of carrying into practical effect a plan of education, which had\r\noccupied much of his attention since 1810, and which in its main\r\nfeatures was, doubtless, suggested by his experience at Hanover, and\r\nWest Point, and was calculated to supply certain deficiencies which he\r\nand others had already noticed in our American colleges and higher\r\nseminaries of learning. His views both of the deficiencies and their\r\nremedies were set forth in a lecture delivered at this time, which was\r\nsubsequently printed. After defining “education in its most perfect\r\nstate to be the preparing a youth in the best possible manner for the\r\ncorrect discharge of the duties of any station in which he may be\r\nplaced,” in this lecture he proceeds to characterize the existing plan\r\nof instruction.\r\n\r\n  1. It is not sufficiently practical, nor properly adapted to the\r\nvarious duties an American citizen may be called upon to discharge.\r\nThose of our youth who are destined for a liberal education, as it is\r\ncalled, are usually put, at an early age, to the study of the Latin and\r\nGreek languages, combining therewith a very slight attention to their\r\nown language, the elements of arithmetic, &c.; and after having devoted\r\nseveral years in this way, they are prepared to become members of a\r\ncollege or university.\r\n\r\n  Here they spend four years for the purpose of acquiring a knowledge of\r\nthe higher branches of learning; after which, they receive their\r\ndiplomat, and are supposed to be prepared to enter on the duties of\r\nactive life. But, I would ask, is this actually the case? Are they\r\nprepared in the best possible manner to discharge correctly the duties\r\nof any station in which fortune or inclination may place them? Have they\r\nbeen instructed in the science of government generally, and more\r\nespecially in the principles of our excellent Constitution, and thereby\r\nprepared to sit in the legislative councils of the nation? Has their\r\nattention been sufficiently directed to those great and important\r\nbranches of national industry and sources of national wealth--\r\nagriculture, commerce, and manufactures? Have they been taught\r\nto examine the policy of other nations, and the effect of that policy on\r\nthe prosperity of their own country? Are they prepared to discharge the\r\nduties of civil or military engineers, or to endure fatigue, or to\r\nbecome the defenders of their country’s rights, and the avengers of her\r\nwrongs, either in the ranks or at the head of her armies? It appears to\r\nme not; and if not, then, agreeably to the standard established, their\r\neducation is so far defective.\r\n\r\n  2. Another defect in the present system, is, the entire neglect, in\r\nall our principal seminaries, of physical education, or the due\r\ncultivation and improvement of the physical powers of the students.\r\n\r\n  The great importance and even absolute necessity of a regular and\r\nsystematic course of exercise for the preservation of health, and\r\nconfirming and rendering vigorous the constitution, I presume, must be\r\nevident to the most superficial observer. It is for want of this, that\r\nso many of our most promising youths lose their health by the time they\r\nare prepared to enter on the grand theatre of active and useful life,\r\nand either prematurely die, or linger out a comparatively useless and\r\nmiserable existence. That the health of the closest applicant may be\r\npreserved, when he is subjected to a regular and systematic course of\r\nexercises, I know, from practical experience; and I have no hesitation\r\nin asserting, that in nine cases out of ten, it is just as easy for a\r\nyouth, however hard he may study, to attain the age of manhood, with a\r\nfirm and vigorous constitution, capable of enduring exposure, hunger and\r\nfatigue, as it is to grow up puny and debilitated, incapable of either\r\nbodily or mental exertion.\r\n\r\n  3. A third defect in our system is, the amount of idle time allowed\r\nthe students; that portion of the day during which they are actually\r\nengaged in study and recitations, under the eye of their instructors,\r\ncomprises but a small portion of the whole; during the remainder, those\r\nthat are disposed to study, will improve at their rooms, while those who\r\nare not so disposed, will not only not improve, but will be very likely\r\nto engage in practices injurious to their constitutions and destructive\r\nto their morals. If this vacant time could be employed in duties and\r\nexercises, which, while they amuse and improve the mind, would at the\r\nsame time invigorate the body and confirm the constitution, it would\r\ncertainly be a great point gained. That this may be done, I shall\r\nattempt in the course of these observations, to show.\r\n\r\n  4. A fourth defect is, the allowing to students, especially to those\r\nof the wealthier class, too much money, thereby inducing habits of\r\ndissipation and extravagance, highly injurious to themselves, and also\r\nto the seminaries of which they are members. I have no hesitation in\r\nasserting, that far the greater portion of the irregularities and\r\ndisorderly proceedings amongst the students of our seminaries, may be\r\ntraced to this fatal cause. Collect together at any seminary, a large\r\nnumber of youths, of the ages they generally are at our institutions,\r\nfurnish them with money, and allow them a portion of idle time, and it\r\nmay be viewed as a miracle, if a large portion of them do not become\r\ncorrupt in morals, and instead of going forth into the world to become\r\nornaments in society, they rather are prepared to become nuisances to\r\nthe same. There is in this respect, an immense responsibility resting on\r\nparents and guardians, as well as on all others having the care and\r\ninstruction of youth, of which it appears to me they are not\r\nsufficiently aware.\r\n\r\n  When youths are sent to a seminary, it is presumed they are sent for\r\nthe purpose of learning something that is useful, and not to acquire bad\r\nhabits, or to spend money; they should consequently be furnished with\r\nevery thing necessary for their comfort, convenience and improvement,\r\nbut money should in no instance be put into their hands. So certainly as\r\nthey have it, just so certainly will they spend it, and this will, in\r\nnine cases out of ten, be done in a manner seriously to injure them,\r\nwithout any corresponding advantage. It frequently draws them into\r\nvicious and dissolute company, and induces habits of immorality and\r\nvice, which ultimately prove their ruin. The over-weening indulgence of\r\nparents, has been the cause of the destruction of the morals and future\r\nusefulness of many a promising youth. They may eventually discover their\r\nerror, but alas, it is often too late to correct it. Much better does\r\nthat person discharge the duties of a real friend to the thoughtless,\r\nunwary youth, who withholds from him the means of indulging in\r\ndissipated and vicious courses.\r\n\r\n  5. A fifth defect is the requiring all the students to pursue the same\r\ncourse of studies.\r\n\r\n  All youth have not the same inclinations, nor the same capacities; one\r\nmay possess a particular inclination and capacity for the study of the\r\nclassics, but not for the mathematics and other branches of science;\r\nwith another it may be the reverse. Now it will be in vain to attempt\r\nmaking a mathematician of the former, or a linguist of the latter.\r\nConsequently, all the time that is devoted in this manner, will be lost,\r\nor something worse than lost. Every youth, who has any capacity or\r\ninclination for the acquirement of knowledge, will have some favorite\r\nstudies, in which he will be likely to excel. It is certainly then much\r\nbetter that he should be permitted to pursue those, than, that by being\r\nforced to attend to others for which he has an aversion, and in which he\r\nwill never excel, or ever make common proficiency, he should finally\r\nacquire a dislike to all study. The celebrated Pascal, is a striking\r\ninstance of the absurdity and folly of attempting to force a youth to\r\nattend to branches of study, for which he has an utter aversion, to the\r\nexclusion of those for which he may possess a particular attachment. Had\r\nthe father of this eminent man persisted in his absurd and foolish\r\ncourse, France would never have seen him, what he subsequently became,\r\none of her brightest ornaments.\r\n\r\n  6. A sixth defect is the prescribing the length of time for\r\ncompleting, as it is termed, a course of education. By these means, the\r\ngood scholar is placed nearly on a level with the sluggard, for whatever\r\nmay be his exertions, he can gain nothing in respect to time, and the\r\nlatter has, in consequence of this, less stimulus for exertion. If any\r\nthing will induce the indolent student to exert himself, it is the\r\ndesire to prevent others getting ahead of him. It would be much better\r\nto allow each one to progress as rapidly as possible, with a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the subject.\r\n\r\nHaving stated what appeared to him the most prominent defects in the\r\nacademies and colleges as organized and conducted, he next proceeds to\r\npoint out the remedies.\r\n\r\n  1. The organization and discipline should be strictly military.\r\n\r\n  Under a military system, subordination and discipline are much more\r\neasily preserved than under any other. Whenever a youth can be impressed\r\nwith the true principles and feelings of a soldier, he becomes, as a\r\nmatter of course, subordinate, honorable, and manly. He disdains\r\nsubterfuge and prevarication, and all that low cunning, which is but too\r\nprevalent. He acts not the part of the assassin, but if he have an\r\nenemy, he meets him openly and fairly. Others may boast that they have\r\nbroken the laws and regulations of the institution of which they are, or\r\nhave been members, and have escaped detection and punishment, by mean\r\nprevarication and falsehood. Not so the real soldier. If he have broken\r\norders and regulations, he will openly acknowledge his error, and\r\nreform; but will not boast of having been insubordinate. Those\r\nprinciples, if imbibed and fixed in early youth, will continue to\r\ninfluence his conduct and actions during life; he will be equally\r\nobservant of the laws of his country, as of the academic regulations\r\nunder which he has lived; and will become the more estimable citizen in\r\nconsequence thereof. I shall not pretend, however, that all who wear a\r\nmilitary garb, or live, for a time, even under a correct system of\r\nmilitary discipline, will be influenced in their conduct by the\r\nprinciples above stated; but if they are not, it only proves that they\r\nhave previously imbibed erroneous principles, which have become too\r\nfirmly fixed to be eradicated; or that nature has not formed them with\r\nminds capable of soaring above what is low and groveling.\r\n\r\n  2. Military science and instruction should constitute a part of the\r\ncourse of education.\r\n\r\n  The constitution of the United States has invested the military\r\ndefense of the country in the great body of the people. By the wise\r\nprovisions of this instrument, and of the laws made in pursuance\r\nthereof, every American citizen, from eighteen to forty-five years of\r\nage, unless specially exempted by law, is liable to be called upon for\r\nthe discharge of military duty--he is emphatically a citizen soldier,\r\nand it appears to me perfectly proper that he should be equally prepared\r\nby education to discharge, correctly, his duties in either capacity. If\r\nwe intend to avoid a standing army, (that bane of a republic, and engine\r\nof oppression in the hands of despots,) our militia must be patronized\r\nand improved, and military information must be disseminated amongst the\r\ngreat mass of the people; when deposited with them, it is in safe hands,\r\nand will never be exhibited in practice, except in opposition to the\r\nenemies of the country. I am well aware there are amongst us many worthy\r\nindividuals, who deem the cultivation of military science a sort of\r\nheresy, flattering themselves, and endeavoring to induce others to\r\nbelieve, that the time has now arrived, or is very near, when wars are\r\nto cease, and universal harmony prevail amongst mankind. But, my\r\nfellow-citizens, be not deceived by the syren song of peace, peace,\r\nwhen, in reality, there is no peace, except in a due and constant\r\npreparation for war. If we turn our attention to Europe, what do we\r\nbehold? A league of crowned despots, impiously called holy, wielding a\r\ntremendous military force of two millions of mercenaries! Ill-fated\r\nNaples, and more ill-fated Spain, have both felt the effects of _their\r\npeaceable_ dispositions, and were it not for the wide-spreading\r\nAtlantic, which the God of nature in his infinite goodness has\r\ninterposed between us, we also, ere this, should have had a like\r\nexperience. The principles of liberty are equally obnoxious to them,\r\nwhether found in Europe, Asia, Africa, or America. If rendering mankind\r\nignorant of the art of war, (as a science,) would prevent wars, then\r\nwould I unite most cordially with those, usually termed peace-men, for\r\nthe purpose of destroying every vestige of it. But such, I am confident,\r\nwould not be the result. Wars amongst nations do not arise because they\r\nunderstand how to conduct them skillfully and on scientific principles;\r\nbut are induced by the evil propensities and dispositions of mankind. To\r\nprevent the effect, the cause must be removed. We may render nations\r\nignorant of the use of the musket and bayonet; we may carry them back,\r\nas respects the art of war, to a state of barbarism, or even of\r\nsavageism, and still wars will exist. So long as mankind possess the\r\ndispositions which they now possess, and which they ever have possessed,\r\nso long they will fight. To prevent wars, then, the disposition must be\r\nchanged; no remedy short of this, will be effectual. In proportion as\r\nnations are rude and unskilled in the art of war, will their military\r\ncode be barbarous and unrelenting, their battles sanguinary, and their\r\nwhole system of warfare, destructive. War, therefore, in such a case,\r\nbecomes a far greater evil, than it does under an improved and refined\r\nsystem, where battles are won more by skill than by hard fighting, and\r\nthe laws of war are proportionally ameliorated. What rational man, what\r\nfriend of mankind, would be willing to exchange the present humane and\r\nrefined system of warfare, for that practiced by an Attila, a Jenghis\r\nKhan, a Tamerlane, or a Mahomet, when hundreds of thousands fell in a\r\nsingle engagement, and when conquest and extermination were synonymous\r\nterms. On the principles of humanity, then, it appears to me that, so\r\nlong as wars do exist, the military art should be improved and refined\r\nas much as possible; for, in proportion as this is done, battles will be\r\nless sanguinary and destructive, the whole system more humane, and war\r\nitself a far less evil. But independent of any connection with the\r\nprofession of arms, or of any of the foregoing considerations,\r\nI consider a scientific knowledge of the military art, as constituting a\r\nvery important part of the education of every individual engaged in the\r\npursuit of useful knowledge, and this for many reasons; viz.:--\r\n\r\n  _First._ It is of great use in the reading of history, both ancient\r\nand modern.\r\n\r\n  A large portion of history is made up of accounts of military\r\noperations, descriptions of battles, sieges, &c. How, I would ask, is\r\nthe reader to understand this part, if he be ignorant of the\r\norganization of armies, of the various systems of military tactics, of\r\nthe science of fortification, and of the attack and defense of fortified\r\nplaces, both in ancient and modern times? Without such knowledge it is\r\nevident he derives, comparatively but little information from a large\r\nportion of what he reads.\r\n\r\n  _Second._ It is of great importance in the writing of history.\r\nI presume it will not be denied, that in order to write well on any\r\nsubject, it must be understood. How, then, can the historian give a\r\ncorrect and intelligible account of a campaign, battle, or siege, who is\r\nnot only unacquainted with the principles on which military operations\r\nare conducted, but is also ignorant of the technical language necessary\r\nfor communicating his ideas intelligibly on the subject? This is the\r\nprincipal reason why, as it appears to me, the ancient historians were\r\nso much superior to the modern. Many of their best historical writers\r\nwere military men. Some of them accomplished commanders. The account of\r\nmilitary operations by such writers as Xenophon, Thucydides, Polybius\r\nand Cæsar, are perfectly clear and intelligible, whereas when attempted\r\nby the great body of modern historians, the most we can learn is, that a\r\nfortress was besieged and taken, or that a battle was fought and a\r\nvictory won, but are left in entire ignorance of the principles on which\r\nthe operations were conducted, or of the reasons why the results were as\r\nthey were.\r\n\r\n  _Third._ It is essentially necessary for the legislator.\r\n\r\n  The military defense of our country is doubtless one of the most\r\nimportant trusts which is vested by the constitution in the general\r\ngovernment, and it is a well known fact, that more money is drawn from\r\nthe people and disbursed in the military, than in any other department\r\nof the government. Now as all must be done under the sanction of the\r\nlaw, I would beg leave to inquire, whether it be not of the greatest\r\nimportance, that those who are to make such laws should be in every\r\nrespect well prepared to legislate understandingly on the subject? That\r\nthere has been, and still is, a want of information on this subject\r\namongst the great body of the members of Congress, I think will be\r\nperfectly evident to any one who is competent, and will take the trouble\r\nto examine our military legislation since the conclusion of the\r\nRevolutionary war. I feel little hesitation in asserting, that from want\r\nof this information, more than from any other cause, as much money has\r\nbeen uselessly expended in our military department alone, as would\r\ncancel a large portion of the national debt.\r\n\r\n  _Fourth._ It is of great use to the traveler.\r\n\r\n  Suppose a young man, with the best education he can obtain at any of\r\nour colleges or universities, were to visit Europe, where the military\r\nconstitutes the first class of the community, and where the\r\nfortifications constitute the most important appendages to nearly all\r\nthe principal cities, how much does he observe, which he does not\r\nunderstand? If he attempt a description of the cities, he finds himself\r\nembarrassed for want of a knowledge of fortification. If he attempt an\r\ninvestigation of the principles and organization of their institutions,\r\nor of their governments, he finds the military so interwoven with them\r\nall, that they can not be thoroughly understood without it. In fine, he\r\nwill return with far less information, than with the aid of a military\r\neducation he might have derived. As it respects the military exercises,\r\nI would observe, that were they of no other use than in preserving the\r\nhealth of students, and confirming in them a good figure and manliness\r\nof deportment, I should consider these were ample reasons for\r\nintroducing them into our seminaries generally; they are better\r\ncalculated than any others for counteracting the natural habits of\r\nstudents, and can always be attended to, at such times as would\r\notherwise be spent in idleness or useless amusements. Having expressed\r\nmy views thus fully on this subject, I will next proceed to state more\r\nspecifically the other branches which I would propose to introduce into\r\na complete course of education: and--\r\n\r\n  1. The course of classical and scientific instruction should be as\r\nextensive and perfect as at our most approved institutions. The students\r\nshould be earnestly enjoined and required to derive as much of useful\r\ninformation from the most approved authors, as their time and\r\ncircumstances would permit.\r\n\r\n  2. A due portion of time should be devoted to practical geometrical\r\nand other scientific operations in the field. The pupils should\r\nfrequently be taken on pedestrian excursions into the country; be\r\nhabituated to endure fatigue, to climb mountains, and to determine their\r\naltitudes by means of the barometer as well as by trigonometry. Those\r\nexcursions, while they would learn them to walk, (which I estimate an\r\nimportant part of education,) and render them vigorous and healthy,\r\nwould also prepare them for becoming men of practical science generally,\r\nand would further confer on them a correct _coup d’œil_ so essentially\r\nnecessary for military and civil engineers, for surveyors, for\r\ntravelers, &c., and which can never be acquired otherwise than by\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n  3. Another portion of their time should be devoted to practical\r\nagricultural pursuits, gardening, &c.\r\n\r\n  In a country like ours, which is emphatically agricultural, I presume\r\nit will not be doubted, that a practical scientific knowledge of\r\nagriculture would constitute an important appendage to the education of\r\nevery American citizen. Indeed the most certain mode of improving the\r\nagriculture of the country will be to make it a branch of elementary\r\neducation. By these means, it will not only be improved, but also a\r\nknowledge of their improvements generally disseminated amongst the great\r\nmass of the people.\r\n\r\n  4. A further portion of time should be devoted to attending familiar\r\nexplanatory lectures on the various branches of military science, on the\r\nprinciples and practice of agriculture, commerce and manufactures, on\r\npolitical economy, on the constitution of the United States, and those\r\nof the individual states, in which should be pointed out particularly\r\nthe powers and duties of the general government, and the existing\r\nrelations between that and the state governments, on the science of\r\ngovernment generally. In fine, on all those branches of knowledge which\r\nare necessary to enable them to discharge, in the best possible manner,\r\nthe duties they owe to themselves, to their fellow men, and to their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n  5. To the institution should be attached a range of mechanics’ shops,\r\nwhere those who possess an aptitude and inclination might occasionally\r\nemploy a leisure hour in learning the use of tools and acquiring a\r\nknowledge of some useful mechanic art.\r\n\r\n  The division of time, each day, I would make as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n  Eight hours to be devoted to study and recitation; eight hours allowed\r\nfor sleep. Three hours for the regular meals, and such other necessary\r\npersonal duties as the student may require. Two hours for the military\r\nand other exercises, fencing, &c. The remaining three hours to be\r\ndevoted, in due proportion, to practical agricultural and scientific\r\npursuits and duties, and in attending lectures on the various subjects\r\nbefore mentioned.\r\n\r\n  Some of the most prominent advantages of the foregoing plan would, in\r\nmy opinion, be the following; viz.:--\r\n\r\n  1. The student would, in the time usually devoted to the acquirement\r\nof elementary education, (say six years) acquire, at least, as much, and\r\nI think I may venture to say more, of book knowledge, than he would\r\nunder the present system.\r\n\r\n  2. In addition to this, he would go into the world an accomplished\r\nsoldier, a scientific and practical agriculturist, an expert\r\nmechanician, an intelligent merchant, a political economist, legislator\r\nand statesman. In fine, he could hardly be placed in any situation, the\r\nduties of which he would not be prepared to discharge with honor to\r\nhimself and advantage to his fellow-citizens and his country.\r\n\r\n  3. In addition to the foregoing, he would grow up with habits of\r\nindustry, economy and morality, and, what is of little less importance,\r\na firm and vigorous constitution; with a head to conceive and an arm to\r\nexecute--he would emphatically possess a sound mind in a sound body.\r\n\r\nAfter much correspondence Capt. Partridge decided to carry out his\r\nprinciples of education in an institution organized on his own plan and\r\nconducted by himself, with such assistance as he could command, in his\r\nnative village of Norwich, Vermont. Here he opened, on the 4th of\r\nSeptember, 1820, the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy,\r\non which the pupils or their parents had their choice of studies, out of\r\na course as extensive as that of any academy and college in New England\r\ncombined--in which military training formed a prominent feature, and the\r\nmathematics, especially as applied to surveying and engineering,\r\nreceived special attention. During the four years and half of its\r\ncontinuance in Norwich the Academy was attended by 480 pupils,\r\nrepresenting twenty-one out of the twenty-four states, and of these, and\r\nespecially of such as continued on an average two years at the\r\ninstitution, a large proportion became distinguished in military,\r\npublic, and business life--as large it is believed as the records of any\r\nother institution for the same period of time can show. Its success\r\ndemonstrated beyond cavil, that military exercises and duties are not\r\ninconsistent with ardent devotion, and the highest attainments in\r\nliterary and scientific studies.\r\n\r\nIn 1824, the citizens of Middletown, Connecticut, made a liberal\r\nsubscription to secure the location there, of a college about to be\r\nestablished in that State, under Episcopal auspices. Failing in that\r\nobject, by the location of the institution at Hartford, where it now\r\nexists under the name of Trinity College, they invited Capt. Partridge\r\nto remove his Academy to their city, and offered to erect and place at\r\nhis disposal suitable buildings for his accommodation. This invitation\r\nand offer were accepted, and on the 1st of April, 1825, he closed his\r\ninstitution at Norwich, and on the 1st of September following, opened\r\nhis new course of instruction at Middletown, with an attendance of two\r\nhundred and ninety-seven pupils in the first year. During the three\r\nyears--up to September 1828, the American Literary, Scientific, and\r\nMilitary Academy at Middletown remained under his superintendence, there\r\nwere nearly twelve hundred pupils representing every State and Territory\r\nof the United States, the British Provinces, Mexico, several of the\r\nSouth American States, and the West Indies. This attendance shows\r\nconclusively, that the military and scientific element, together with an\r\noptional course of study, and a term of residence limited by the ability\r\nof the pupil to complete the course, met a want not provided for in\r\nexisting colleges. Of those who completed the full course of study begun\r\nat Norwich, as large a proportion, as the corresponding graduates of any\r\nAmerican college, attained a high degree of usefulness and eminence in\r\nwidely diversified fields of labor. Among its graduates are to be found\r\nthe founders or professors of several State Military Institutes, many\r\nofficers of the highest rank in the military service of the United\r\nStates, several eminent civil engineers, superintendents, of railroads,\r\nmembers of Congress, lawyers, and men of practical efficiency and\r\nsuccess in every line of business.\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristic features of Captain Partridge’s system of\r\ninstruction and discipline at Middletown, was the military marches and\r\npedestrian excursions for scientific and recreating purposes conducted\r\nunder his personal command, or in his company. Several of these\r\nexcursions occupied three or four weeks, extending in one instance to\r\nWashington. The military marches amounted in the aggregate to over two\r\nthousand miles, and these and the various pedestrian excursions,\r\nincluded visits to nearly all points of military and historical interest\r\nin New England and New York. The immediate and controlling reasons which\r\ninduced Capt. Partridge to leave Middletown, are not known to the writer\r\nof this memoir. He has however, understood it was owing partly to a\r\ndesire for temporary relief from the cares and confinement of immediate\r\nsuperintendence, that he might start a similar institution in the\r\nneighborhood of New York, and partly from disgust at the refusal of the\r\nLegislature of Connecticut in 1828, to grant to the institution at\r\nMiddletown, the usual privileges and powers of a college.\r\n\r\nIn 1833,1834, 1837, and 1839, Capt. Partridge was elected representative\r\nfrom the town of Norwich, to the Legislature of Vermont, and in that\r\ncapacity labored to give efficiency to the military system of the State.\r\nIn 1834, he secured for certain petitioners a charter for the Norwich\r\nUniversity, in which the Trustees are required “to provide for a\r\nconstant course of instruction in military science and civil\r\nengineering,” and are “prohibited from establishing any regulations of a\r\nsectarian character, either in religion or politics.” Of this\r\ncorporation, consisting of twenty-five trustees, Capt. Partridge was a\r\nmember, and in organizing the institution in 1825, he was elected\r\npresident of the Faculty. He continued to instruct in his own department\r\nof military science and engineering, and administered the affairs of the\r\nuniversity till 1844, when owing to some difficulties arising out of the\r\nuse of the building, arms, and accourtrements, which were his private\r\nproperty, he resigned.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, he was influential in calling together a convention of military\r\nofficers and persons interested in giving greater efficiency to the\r\norganization of the militia of the several states, to meet for\r\nconsultation. This convention met at Norwich on the 4th of July; and\r\ncontinued to meet annually for many years, to discuss plans for the\r\norganization and discipline of the militia, for the dissemination of a\r\nknowledge of military science, for the defense of the coast, &c. Many\r\nreports of this body were drawn up by him, and the proceedings were\r\nforwarded to, and printed by order of the Congress of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, on the request of many influential citizens, he visited\r\nPortsmouth, Virginia, to establish a Military School, which he did, and\r\nwhich was soon after recognized by the Legislature of the State as the\r\nVirginia Literary, Scientific, and Military Institute, and aided by an\r\nappropriation out of the Literary Fund. This Institute, with an\r\nInstitute of a similar character at Lexington, in the western part of\r\nthe State, has been greatly instrumental in diffusing widely in Virginia\r\na knowledge and taste for military affairs. The success of this\r\ninstitution, and the personal influence of many of his own scholars at\r\nNorwich and Middletown, led to the establishment of similar schools in\r\nother southern states.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1842, Capt. Partridge accepted the position of Camp Instructor\r\nfor a large body of officers and men of the Pennsylvania volunteer\r\nmilitia in encampment at Reading, Berks County. Each evening he\r\ndelivered a lecture to officers assembled in the General’s marquee, and\r\nduring the day exercised the troops in the manual of arms, and in\r\ncompany, regimental, and brigade movements in the field. On this, and\r\nmany similar occasions, he demonstrated the correctness and\r\npracticability of his theory of national defense, so far as testing the\r\nqualifications of officers for command, and giving accuracy, rapidity,\r\nand steadiness of exercise and movements to troops, by assembling\r\nofficers and men of the State Militia, once or twice in the year, in\r\nconvenient numbers and places, under instructors properly qualified for\r\nthe work. A few instructors, themselves trained in the best military\r\ninstitutions, and familiar with every improvement in military\r\norganization, equipment, and movement, and especially when clothed with\r\nthe reputation of success in actual service, would soon bring the entire\r\nmilitia of the states into a uniform system, and give respectability and\r\nefficiency to this department of the public service. This result would\r\nbe more speedily realized if a number of educational institutions\r\nsimilar to those which he had organized under many disadvantages and\r\nagainst many prejudices, could call out and cultivate military taste and\r\naccomplishments among a portion of the young men of each state.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, he opened at Brandywine Springs, near Wilmington, in the State\r\nof Delaware, another institution in which he fondly hoped his ideal of a\r\nNational school of education would be realized--an institution in which\r\nphysical training in connection with military exercises and movements,\r\nshould accompany the acquisition of practical knowledge of the great\r\nprinciples of science that underlie all the arts of peace and war, and\r\nresorted to by students from every state of the American Union. His plan\r\nas developed in conversation with those directly interested, embraced\r\nhis old ideas of scientific, and literary studies with systematic\r\npedestrian excursions,[21] and marches in vacations to the great objects\r\nof natural, economical, and historical interest in different parts of\r\nthe country. In this latter particular, he unconsciously applied the\r\nsuggestion of Milton in his letter to Samuel Hartlib, that “the students\r\nof his Academy should go out in companies with prudent and staid guides\r\nto all quarters of the land, learning and observing all places of\r\nstrength, and all commodities (facilities) of building and of soil, for\r\ntowns and tillage, harbors and ports of trade,--even sometimes taking\r\nsea as far as to our navy to learn there also, what they can in the\r\npractical knowledge of sailing and sea-fight.” Arrangements were made\r\nfor a class of ten or twelve of the most advanced and matured cadets to\r\naccompany him to Europe to study the strategy of the great battles of\r\nthe world, and the armies, armories, and resources of the great nations\r\nof Europe--thus again realizing Milton’s plan of gratifying “the desire\r\nof the more hopeful youth” “to see other countries at three or four and\r\ntwenty years of age, not to learn principles, but to enlarge experience\r\nand make wise observation.” But these hopes were darkened for a time by\r\na great disaster, and soon extinguished in the sudden death of the great\r\nprojector. In the autumn of 1853, the buildings at Brandywine Springs,\r\nwere consumed by fire, and although arrangements were at once made to\r\nsecure suitable accommodations at Bristol, Pennsylvania, and upwards of\r\none hundred pupils enrolled their names to attend for a year at that\r\nplace, still the great motive power of the enterprise was stricken down.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: Captain Partridge attached much importance to\r\n    pedestrian excursions in reference both to hygenic, and\r\n    educational considerations. To these excursions he attributed his\r\n    own robust health, and his familiar knowledge of all the details\r\n    of American battles. In one year, (1830,) he made four excursions\r\n    from Norwich, each occupying from four to six days--and from one\r\n    hundred and fifty to four hundred miles--the last day’s walk\r\n    generally averaging over sixty miles. He had ascended and measured\r\n    the altitude of all the highest mountain elevations in the\r\n    Northern States.]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year, 1853, Capt. Partridge returned to Norwich,\r\nwhere his family still resided, in apparently good health and the best\r\nspirits. A few days after he reached home, he was attacked by sharp and\r\nexcruciating pains in his back, which were soon subdued by anodynes, but\r\nfrom the prostration and the cause, which proved on a post-mortem\r\nexamination to be an aneurism near the base of the spine, and which had\r\nbeen exhausting his vitality for years--he never rallied, and on the\r\n17th of January, 1854, he breathed his last--widely and deeply mourned\r\nby troops of friends, who loved and admired him as their teacher, or\r\nlooked up to him as the best expounder of principles of military science\r\nand education, and of national defense.\r\n\r\nAlthough living most of his life in the discharge of educational and\r\npublic duties, under circumstances inconsistent with “a local\r\nhabitation,” he had strong domestic tastes and attachments, and was a\r\ngenial companion in his own room and home. In 1837, he married Miss\r\nSwazey, the daughter of a merchant in Claremont, New Hampshire, and to\r\nthis happy union were born two children. The oldest boy, George, was\r\neducated by the father on his own system, and had displayed vigorous\r\nhealth, and strong partialities and attainments in mathematical studies\r\nand their applications; but he survived his father only a few\r\nmonths--“long desolate months they were to the widow and children ”--and\r\nthe tenement of that bright intellect was laid by the side of that of\r\nhis hardy and indefatigable father in the little village burying-ground.\r\nThe other son Henry, as he grew up, showed a partiality for the\r\nprofession of law, and was pursuing his studies in Warren, Penn., when\r\nthe call of the President of the United States for volunteers, summoned\r\nhim to the defense of the flag of the country. He enlisted for the war,\r\nand was promoted to a captaincy in a Pennsylvania regiment, which was\r\nattached to the army of the Potomac, whose varying fortunes he shared\r\ntill, greatly weakened by exposure and disease, he was honorably\r\ndischarged from the service. His superior officer in writing to his\r\nmother, says: “He is in every respect a model officer. How could he be\r\notherwise? He has it all by right of inheritance, and I fully appreciate\r\nthat you have made a very great contribution to the government and the\r\ncountry in sending him forth to fight the battles which have been forced\r\nupon us.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULAR OBJECTIONS TO A NATIONAL MILITARY SCHOOL.\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nAs an Appendix to our Memoir of Capt. Alden Partridge, we republish the\r\nfollowing Memorial by him to the Congress of the United States, not\r\nbecause we approve the objects or the arguments of either document, but\r\nas part of the educational history of the country.\r\n\r\n  MEMORIAL OF ALDEN PARTRIDGE,\r\n\r\n  _Relating to the Military Academy at West Point, and praying that\r\nyoung men educated at other military schools may have an equal chance\r\nfor admission to the army as those young men have who are educated at\r\nWest Point. January 21, 1841. Referred to the Committee on Military\r\nAffairs._\r\n\r\n  _To the Honorable Congress of the United States:_--The memorial of\r\nAlden Partridge, President of the Norwich University, at Norwich, State\r\nof Vermont, respectfully showeth:\r\n\r\n  That your memorialist holds it to be a cardinal principle of our\r\nrepublican institutions, that stations of honor, trust, and emolument\r\nshould be equally open to all our citizens, to which all have an equal\r\nright to aspire, and from which none can constitutionally be excluded by\r\nany law, rule, or regulation whatever. Your memorialist has, however,\r\nwitnessed, with deep regret, a direct violation of this vital principle\r\nof our constitution, by the rules and regulations adopted for the\r\norganization and government of the Military Academy at West Point. The\r\ncadets of that institution, all of whom are educated at the _public_\r\nexpense, have, for many years, _monopolized_ nearly, if not quite, all\r\nof the stations of honor, trust, and emolument, above that of a\r\nnon-commissioned officer, in the military establishment of the United\r\nStates, to the utter exclusion of those who are equally well qualified,\r\nequally meritorious, and who are educated at their _own_ expense. But,\r\nin order to place this subject more clearly before your honorable body,\r\nyour memorialist would call your attention to the law of the 29th of\r\nApril, 1812, entitled, “An act making further provision for the corps of\r\nengineers.” By the provisions of this act, no candidate can be admitted\r\ninto the Military Academy who is under fourteen, or over twenty-one,\r\nyears of age. The effect of this provision is to exclude every young man\r\nin the United States who is above twenty-one years of age from the\r\nappointment of cadet, while the rules of the War department require that\r\nnone except those educated at this academy can be commissioned in the\r\narmy of the United States. The effect, then, of the law and regulation\r\nis to utterly exclude all the youth of our country, except such select\r\nfew as the President may think proper to place in this “public charity\r\nschool,” from the military service of their country, who are above\r\ntwenty-one years of age, unless they will enter in the humble capacity\r\nof _privates_ or _non-commissioned officers_. And can such a system be\r\nin accordance with the principles of our constitution? Your memorialist\r\nbelieves not. On the contrary, he feels confident in the assertion that\r\nit is a most flagrant and palpable violation of them. The direct and\r\ncertain effect of this institution is to extend _Executive patronage_;\r\nfor the President has the entire selection of the _chosen two hundred_\r\nand _fifty_ who are to be placed in the institution, and also to\r\nestablish an _aristocracy_ of the most dangerous kind, viz.: a\r\n_military_ aristocracy in the United States. What, your memorialist\r\nwould ask, is an aristocracy? Is it not where any particular class in a\r\nState claims and exercises privileges of which the great body of the\r\npeople are deprived? And do not the cadets at West Point enjoy such\r\nprivileges? and if so, do they not constitute an aristocracy? Your\r\nmemorialist believes that neither the fact nor the inference can be\r\ncontroverted. But your memorialist will go further, and aver that the\r\nregulations at West Point have not only constituted an aristocracy in\r\nthe United States, but that this aristocracy has already become, in a\r\ngreat degree, _hereditary_. How many individuals, your memoralist would\r\nask, who have held offices of honor, trust, or emolument, under the\r\nGovernment, for the last twenty-five years, have had their sons,\r\nbrothers, nephews, or other relatives, educated at the public expense at\r\nWest Point, to the entire exclusion of those who (to say the least,)\r\nwere equally meritorious, and equally capable of rendering service to\r\nthe republic? And how many of those thus educated have ever rendered any\r\nservice whatever? A reference to the rolls of the institution will\r\nanswer these inquiries. Your memorialist has _personal_ knowledge of\r\nmany instances. Your memorialist is well aware that it has been\r\nattempted, by the friends of this monstrous invasion of the rights of\r\nthe people, to cast around it the mantle of Mr. Jefferson. Your\r\nmemorialist is ready to grant that the institution was established\r\nduring the early part of the first term of Mr. Jefferson’s\r\nadministration; but denies that any inference can be drawn from that\r\ncircumstance to sustain the present system. The institution _then_\r\nconsisted only of the corps of engineers, which was limited to sixteen\r\nofficers and four cadets, without any of those exclusive privileges\r\nwhich have since been conferred upon it. On the 29th of April, 1812,\r\n(just previous to the declaration of war,) a law was, however, passed,\r\nentitled “An act making further provision for the corps of engineers;”\r\nby the provisions of which, the whole number of cadets, whether of\r\ninfantry, artillery, or riflemen, was not to exceed two hundred and\r\nfifty; and the President to appoint a limited number of cadets, and\r\nconferring on him a _discretionary_ power to attach them to the Military\r\nAcademy, was evidently induced by the certainty of immediate war with\r\nGreat Britain, and had a direct reference to a _war_ establishment. Your\r\nmemorialist would respectfully call the attention of your honorable body\r\nparticularly to the provisions of the law of 1812 just referred to; and,\r\nif he does not much mistake, it will satisfactorily appear that the\r\nPresident is not _required_, but simply authorized, to appoint a single\r\ncadet; and that it is left entirely discretionary with him, after they\r\nare appointed, to attach them to the Military Academy, or to attach them\r\nto their respective companies, agreeably to the provisions of other laws\r\nthen in existence. And here your memorialist would observe that, in the\r\n_peace_-establishment of the army previous to the late war, two cadets\r\nwere allowed to each company of artillery, light infantry, and infantry,\r\namounting, in the total, to a _larger_ number than was authorized by the\r\nlaw of 1812. But neither President Jefferson, nor President Madison\r\nconsidered that the law required of them to fill those vacancies so long\r\nas they considered their services were not required; and they\r\nconsequently did not fill them. The largest number of cadets ever in\r\nservice at the same time, previous to the late war, did not exceed\r\nforty, and seldom exceeded twenty-five. Do the necessities of the\r\ncountry require that any larger number should be retained in service\r\nnow, than were deemed necessary by Presidents Jefferson and Madison\r\nduring a time of peace? Your memorialist believes not. But it is urged,\r\nin favor of this academy, that it presents a most favorable opportunity\r\nfor the education of meritorious young men who are poor, and,\r\nconsequently, unable to educate themselves. Your memorialist, however,\r\nhas yet to learn by what _constitutional_ authority Congress is\r\nempowered to appropriate any portion of the public revenue for the\r\nsupport of a _national charity school_ for the education of the poor.\r\nBesides, if this power did exist, (which your memorialist presumes no\r\nreasonable person will contend does,) _all_ the poor in the United\r\nStates have an equal right to the benefits to be derived from its\r\nexercise, and that, consequently, the institution at West Point is on\r\nquite too limited a plan for the accomplishment of the contemplated\r\nobject. Either, then, the institution should be very much enlarged, or\r\nseveral others established in different parts of the United States,\r\nwhich would be far more convenient for the great body of the poor. If,\r\nhowever, the rolls of this institution for the last twenty years be\r\nexamined, it will be found that many more of the _rich_ and\r\n_influential_ have been educated there, than of the _poor_. Poverty,\r\nhowever meritorious the subject of it may be, is but a sorry\r\nrecommendation for admission to this aristocratic establishment.\r\n\r\n  But it is further urged, that this institution is _necessary_ for the\r\neducation of the officers of the army; and that, were it abolished, the\r\ncandidates for commissions would not be properly qualified for the\r\ndischarge of their duties as officers. Before your memorialist proceeds\r\nto examine the truth of this position, he would inquire, at what\r\ninstitution, and at whose expense, Generals Washington, Greene, Knox,\r\nPutnam, Lincoln, Sullivan, Morgan, Wayne, Sumter, Pickens, Marion, and\r\nall the other officers of the revolutionary army, by whose valor, skill,\r\nand patriotic exertions, these United States now constitute a free and\r\nindependent nation, received their education? The answer is ready: at\r\nthe ordinary institutions of the country, and at their _own_ expense;\r\njust as every _American citizen_ should be educated. And have the\r\n_proteges_ of the West Point Academy, on whose education so many\r\nmillions of dollars of the peoples’ money have been expended within the\r\nlast twenty years, exhibited more skill, more valor, or more patriotism,\r\nthan did the officers of the revolutionary army? Let the events of the\r\nFlorida war, as compared with those of the Revolution, answer the\r\nquestion. The truth is, (and it can not be much longer concealed from\r\nthe view of the people, by the reports of _boards of visitors_,) that\r\nthe whole system of education at West Point is well calculated to form\r\n_military pedants_ and _military dandies_, but will never form\r\n_efficient soldiers_. Much more important to them is their attention to\r\nthe _cut_ of the _coat_, the placing of a _button_, and the _snowy\r\nwhiteness of gloves and pantaloons_, than to those _physical_ and _moral\r\nqualities_ which are absolutely necessary to the correct and efficient\r\ndischarge of the active duties of the field.\r\n\r\n  But your memorialist denies the truth of the position, that the West\r\nPoint Academy is necessary for the education of young men for the army.\r\nThere are other institutions where military science and instruction\r\nconstitute a branch of education for the pupils. Of these institutions,\r\nhowever, your memorialist will particularize but one--and that is the\r\nNorwich University, at Norwich, Vermont, over which he has the honor to\r\npreside. This institution was incorporated by the Legislature of\r\nVermont, in November, 1834, with full power to confer diplomas, &c. By\r\nthe act of incorporation, military science is made a part of the\r\neducation of all the pupils. They are consequently correctly and\r\nthoroughly instructed in the theoretical part of military science, and\r\nalso in the _practical_ duties of the soldier, and every one who\r\ngraduates at this institution is well qualified to discharge the duties\r\nof a company officer (and even, if necessary, to command a battalion) in\r\nany corps of the army. In order further to prepare them to discharge the\r\nmore hardy and active duties of the soldier, they occasionally perform\r\nmilitary marches. In the month of July, 1840, they performed a march,\r\nunder the personal command of your memorialist, to the celebrated\r\n_military post_ of Ticonderoga, carrying their arms, accoutrements,\r\nknapsacks, &c.; the whole length of which was one hundred and sixty-five\r\nmiles. Of this distance, one hundred and forty miles was on foot, and\r\ntwenty-five miles by steamboat. The march on foot was performed in a\r\nlittle more than five days, crossing the Green Mountain range twice, and\r\nthe ground, with the heavens for covering, constituted their only\r\nresting-place at night. The weather, during the whole march, was hot;\r\nand they were enveloped in a cloud of dust, occasioned by the severe\r\ndrought, nearly the whole distance. They all returned in excellent\r\nhealth and spirits. The youngest member of the corps was thirteen years\r\nof age. The other branches of literature and science are attended to as\r\nextensively, and the latter much more practically, than at any other\r\ninstitution in the United States; and the students are consequently\r\nequally well qualified to discharge their duties in the _cabinet_ and in\r\nthe _field_. But notwithstanding the members of this institution are, to\r\nsay the least, as well qualified for commissions of any grade, and in\r\nany corps of the army, as those of any other institution in the country,\r\nand have also obtained the necessary qualifications at their own\r\nexpense, they are virtually excluded therefrom by the _arbitrary_ and\r\n_monopolizing_ regulations (established without the least sanction of\r\nlaw,) of the Military Academy at West Point. In the month of September,\r\n1840, a member of the Norwich University, the son of a highly\r\nrespectable gentleman in the city of New York, well recommended, applied\r\nto the Secretary of War for a commission in the army, but was informed\r\nthat there were _no vacancies_, and that the cadets from West Point were\r\n_more than sufficient to fill all the vacancies_. On the 21st of\r\nDecember, 1840, your memorialist wrote to the Secretary of War,\r\nrecommending three young gentlemen, members of the Norwich University,\r\nfor commissions in the army of the United States; and received an\r\nanswer, dated War Department, December 29, 1840, from which the\r\nfollowing is an extract: “I acknowledge the receipt of your letter of\r\nthe 21st instant, recommending Messrs. Morris, Stevens, and Dorne, for\r\nappointments in the army; and I have here to inform you, in reply, that\r\nthere being no vacancies at present, the application will be filed for\r\nconsideration, when any occur, _to which they can be appointed_.” Now\r\nyour memorialist feels confident that the records of the War Department\r\nwill show that a large number of cadets at West Point are commissioned\r\nevery year; and he presumes that such will continue to be the case,\r\nunless a radical change is effected. But when young gentlemen of equal\r\nrespectability and attainments, who have not been of the _favored few_\r\nwhom _Executive favor_ has admitted into this nursery of aristocracy, to\r\nbe educated at the expense of the honest working men of the country,\r\nbecome applicants, their claims are entirely set aside. Against this\r\n_unconstitutional_, _unequal_, and _monopolizing_ practice, your\r\nmemorialist deems it his duty respectfully, but most decidedly, to\r\nprotest; and to ask of your honorable body the establishment of some\r\nrule whereby the members of the Norwich University, at least, (to whom,\r\nin many respects, he stands in the relation of guardian,) may be\r\nrestored to their _constitutional rights_; that when they become\r\napplicants for stations of honor, trust, or emolument, in the military\r\nservice of their country, they shall stand on terms of equality with the\r\ncadets at West Point.\r\n\r\n  Your memorialist deems it proper here to remark, that in October,\r\n1840, he addressed a communication to the President of the United\r\nStates, on this subject, requesting to be informed whether, in the\r\nopinion of the President, he possessed the power to remedy the grievance\r\nof which your memorialist complains; and, if so, whether such power\r\nwould be exercised for that purpose. To this communication no answer has\r\nbeen received. Your memorialist, availing himself of the privileges\r\ngranted to every American citizen, by the first amendment of the\r\nconstitution of the United States, would beg leave to call the attention\r\nof your honorable body to some subjects, which he considers grievances\r\nof a high order, and respectfully but earnestly solicits that they may\r\nbe redressed, viz:\r\n\r\n  1st. Your memorialist considers the Military Academy at West Point a\r\ngrievance. Under its present organization, it is unconstitutional,\r\ncalculated to foster a military aristocracy in the country; calculated\r\nto depress the militia, (our only constitutional defense,) by engrossing\r\nall the patronage of government; and is entirely unnecessary, as\r\nmilitary science can be attained at other institutions, from which the\r\nnecessary officers for the army can be supplied without any tax on the\r\npeople. Your memorialist, therefore, asks that this institution may be\r\nabolished, and that the money that is annually appropriated for its\r\nsupport may be applied to aid in disciplining the militia, and\r\ndisseminating military information amongst the people, who are its\r\nconstitutional and safe depositories.\r\n\r\n  2nd. Your memorialist considers the Board of Visitors that annually\r\nassemble at West Point a grievance. This board never had any _existence\r\nwhatever in law_, but was established by Executive usurpation; yet, to\r\npay the expense of this illegal board, your memorialist believes that\r\nmore than fifty thousand dollars has been drawn from the public\r\ntreasury. Your memorialist earnestly solicits that this appropriation,\r\nthe making of which is a direct sanction to Executive _usurpation_,\r\nshould be discontinued.\r\n\r\n  3rd. Your memorialist considers the removal of the head-quarters of\r\nthe corps of engineers from West Point to Washington a grievance,\r\nbecause it is a direct violation of the law of the 16th of March, 1802,\r\nestablishing that corps. That law requires the commandant of engineers\r\nto reside at West Point, unless ordered, by the President of the United\r\nStates, on duty at some other place in the line of his profession; and,\r\nwhen, at West Point, the law makes him superintendent of the Military\r\nAcademy; and when he is absent, the next in rank (who is then present,)\r\nis made the _legal_ superintendent. The appointment, therefore, of any\r\nparticular officer as permanent superintendent, is evidently illegal, as\r\nthe law has clearly specified who the superintendent shall be.\r\n\r\n    All of which is respectfully submitted,\r\n\r\n    A. PARTRIDGE,\r\n    _President of Norwich University_.\r\n\r\n    JANUARY, 13, 1841.\r\n\r\nREMARKS BY THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\nWe publish the foregoing Memorial of Capt. Partridge, asking Congress to\r\nredress “the grievance” of the Military Academy, not because we have the\r\nslightest sympathy with the object or main arguments of the memorialist,\r\nbut as specimens of the opinions held and propagated by a graduate,\r\nprofessor, and superintendent of the Academy, who did more than any\r\nother individual to introduce military instruction and exercises in\r\nschools not national or professionally military. We can not, however,\r\nput it forth without accompanying it with a few brief remarks.\r\n\r\nTo Capt. Partridge, more than to any one man, and to his pupils, and\r\npersonal friends, as we believe, is due the popular objections which\r\nprevail respecting the United States Military Academy, except so far as\r\nthe objections spring from the abuse of the mode of appointing Cadets.\r\nFor nearly twenty years Capt. Partridge was never known to express any\r\ndoubt of the constitutionality or usefulness of this institution. His\r\nobjections first took shape and utterance when he was superceded in the\r\nsuperintendence by Colonel Sylvanus Thayer. Of the circumstances and\r\nresults of his removal, and of the appointment of Col. Thayer, and the\r\nsubsequent reorganization of the Academy, something has already been\r\nsaid in the History of West Point, in this volume, (p. 17-48,) and more\r\nwill be said when we come to speak of the labors of Col. Thayer.\r\n\r\nSo far as these objections are directed to the constitutionality of the\r\nlaws for establishing the Cadet Corps, as distinct from any other Corps\r\nof the army, or against training officers collected together and\r\norganized as a school, we think them preëminently frivolous. If any\r\nfriend of the Academy would assure his doubtful faith in its\r\nconstitutionality, let him read Capt. Partridge’s Memorial, asking the\r\nsame Congress to establish a system of National Education, which he\r\npetitions to redress the grievance of a special school, that every\r\ncivilized government holds to be indispensable to the right organization\r\nof its armies.\r\n\r\nSo far as these objections are aimed at the mode of appointment and\r\npromotion,--confining both to the patronage of one man in the country,\r\nor one man in a Congressional District, acting in either case without\r\npersonal examination of the party to be admitted or promoted, and\r\nexcluding others, it may be, better qualified,--we hold them to be\r\nvalid. A more disgraceful record of failures, where an opportunity of\r\nselecting the most meritorious candidates existed, can not be shown.\r\n\r\nWhile we believe that candidates are too often recommended and nominated\r\nto the appointing power, from family and party considerations, we have\r\nseen no reason to believe that the social condition or occupation of\r\nparents has influenced the appointments. On the other hand, the records\r\nof the Academy, as made out in this particular by the Cadets themselves,\r\nexhibit a fair representation from all classes and occupations of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nAccording to an official Statement, prepared by Capt. Boynton, and\r\npublished in his History of the Academy, of 5206 cadets admitted from\r\n1842 to 1863 inclusive, the fathers of 1,300 were farmers or planters;\r\nof 681, were lawyers; of 672, were merchants; of 377, were mechanics; of\r\n69, were physicians; of 256, were in the civil service; of 116, were\r\nclergymen; of 467, were in the army or navy; of 572, were editors,\r\nmasters of vessels, &c. Of the whole number, 1,136 were orphans, 1,585\r\nwere in moderate, 534 in reduced, 62 in indigent, and 324 in independent\r\ncircumstances. We shall publish the Statement in our next Number.\r\n\r\nThe views presented in the memorial of Capt. Partridge in 1841, have\r\nfound advocates in and out of Congress before and since. They were\r\nanticipated by the Secretary of War (John C. Calhoun), under whose\r\nenergetic administration of the Department in 1816, the Academy first\r\nassumed the organization of an efficient military school--a place of\r\nthorough scientific instruction in the knowledge not simply of military\r\ndrill, but of the duties of an accomplished artillerist and military\r\nengineer; and they have been deepened by the radically vicious system of\r\nappointment to cadetship, in which personal and political considerations\r\nhave in too many instances outweighed the merits of young men, whose\r\nnatural aptitude and generous ambition would have found here the special\r\nfield for their largest development and usefulness. These views found\r\nexpression in the elaborate speech of Franklin Pierce, then a member of\r\nthe House from New Hampshire, in the discussion of an amendment to the\r\nappropriation bill in 1836 (June 30), who “felt bound to oppose the bill\r\nin every stage of its progress”--mainly on the ground that “the\r\ninstitution conferred exclusive and gratuitous privileges.”\r\n\r\n  It is _gratuitous_, because those who are so fortunate as to obtain\r\nadmission there, receive their education without any obligation, except\r\nsuch as a sense of honor may impose, to return, either by service or\r\notherwise, the slightest equivalent. It is exclusive, inasmuch as only\r\none youth out of a population of more than 47,000 can participate in its\r\nadvantages at the same time; and those who are successful, are admitted\r\nat an age when their characters cannot have become developed, and with\r\nvery little knowledge of their adaptation, mental or physical, for\r\nmilitary life. The system disregards one of those great principles\r\nwhich, carried into practice, contributed perhaps, more than any other,\r\nto render the arms of Napoleon invincible for so many years. Who does\r\nnot perceive that it destroys the very life and spring of military ardor\r\nand enthusiasm, by utterly foreclosing all hope of promotion to her\r\nsoldier and non-commissioned officer? However meritorious may be his\r\nservices, however pre-eminent may become his qualifications for command,\r\nall are unavailing. The portcullis is dropped between him and\r\npreferment, the wisdom of your laws having provided another criterion\r\nthan that of admitted courage and conduct, by which to determine who are\r\nworthy of command. They have made an Academy, where a certain number of\r\nyoung gentlemen are educated annually at the public expense, and to\r\nwhich there is, in consequence, a general rush, not so much from\r\nsentiments of patriotism, and a taste for military life, as from motives\r\nless worthy--the avenue, and the only avenue, to rank in your army.\r\n\r\n  I deny utterly the expediency and the right to educate at the public\r\nexpense, any number of young men who, on the completion of their\r\neducation, are not to form a portion of your military force, but to\r\nreturn to the walks of private life. Such was never the operation of the\r\nMilitary Academy until after the law of 1812; and the doctrine, so far\r\nas I have been able to ascertain, was first formally announced by a\r\ndistinguished individual, at this time sufficiently jealous of the\r\nexercise of executive patronage, and greatly alarmed by what he\r\nconceives to be the tendencies of this Government to centralism and\r\nconsolidation. It may be found in the report of the Secretary of War,\r\ncommunicated to Congress in 1819.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce, afterwards President Pierce, quotes with approbation the\r\nsuggestion of Col. Williams in a report to Mr. Jefferson in 1808--that\r\nthe plan should be large enough to take not only minor officers, “but\r\nalso any youth from any of the States who might wish for such an\r\neducation whether designed for the Army or Navy, or neither, and let\r\nthem be assessed to the value of their education, which might form a\r\nfund for extra or contingent expenses.”\r\n\r\n  These are the true doctrines upon this subject; doctrines worthy of\r\nthe administration under which they were promulgated, and in accordance\r\nwith the views of statesmen in the earlier and purer days of the\r\nRepublic. Give to the officers of your army the highest advantages for\r\nperfection in all the branches of military science, and let those\r\nadvantages be open to all in rotation, and under such terms and\r\nregulations as shall be at once impartial toward the officers, and\r\nadvantageous to the service; but let all young gentlemen who have a\r\ntaste for military life, and desire to adopt arms as a profession,\r\nprepare themselves for subordinate situations at their own expense, or\r\nat the expense of their parents or guardians, in the same manner that\r\nthe youth of our country are qualified for the professions of civil\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n  I am far from desiring to see this country destitute of a Military\r\nAcademy; but I would have it a school of practice, and instruction, for\r\nofficers actually in the service of the United States; not an\r\ninstitution for educating, gratuitously, young gentlemen, who, on the\r\ncompletion of their term, or after a few months’ leave of absence,\r\nresign their commissions, and return to the pursuits of civil life.\r\n\r\n  There has already been expended upon the institution more than three\r\nmillions, three hundred thousand dollars. Between 1815 and 1831,\r\nthirteen hundred and eighteen students were admitted into the Academy;\r\nand of all the cadets who were ever there, only two hundred and\r\nsixty-five remained in the service at the end of 1830. Here are the\r\nexpenses you have incurred, and the products you have realized.\r\n\r\nWhen the War of Secession broke out, and graduates of the Academy then\r\nin the army,--like many other Southern men, in the civil service of the\r\nUnited States, imbued with the political doctrines and sympathizing with\r\nthe domestic institution, on which the War was based--sided with the\r\npolitical leaders of their several states, the opposition to the\r\ninstitution took another direction. The record of the War silenced these\r\nobjectors. According to Gen. Cullum’s _Biographical Register of the\r\nGraduates of the Military Academy_, out of 1,249 graduates living at the\r\nbeginning of the Rebellion, 99 in civil life and 184 from the army,\r\njoined in the war against the United States. Three-fourths remained\r\nfaithful. Of 821 graduates in the Army at the time, 184 (about\r\none-fifth) joined in the Rebellion. Of the 99 in civil life all but one\r\nwere residents in slave territory. Of 350 graduates who were born in or\r\nappointed from slave States, 162 remained loyal. Of the 292 loyal\r\ngraduates in civil life, at the date of secession, 115 re-entered the\r\nArmy--all below the age of 45, except those who were disabled for active\r\nduty, and most of these served in civil capacities. One-fifth of all the\r\ngraduates who served in the battles of the Rebellion, one-fifth laid\r\ndown their lives, and more than one-half were wounded in defence of the\r\nflag.\r\n\r\nIV. AMERICAN LITERARY, SCIENTIFIC, AND MILITARY ACADEMY.\r\n\r\nAT NORWICH, VERMONT.\r\n\r\nThe American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy, at Norwich,\r\nVermont, was opened on the 4th of September, 1820, by Capt. Alden\r\nPartridge, and continued under his personal superintendence and\r\ninstruction, assisted by several professors, until April 1st, 1825, when\r\nit was discontinued at Norwich, and reopened at Middletown, Connecticut.\r\nThe catalogue of the officers and cadets published August, 1821,\r\ncontains a prospectus from which we make extracts to exhibit the aims of\r\nthat school and of this particular class of institutions at that date.\r\n\r\n  TERMS OF ADMISSION.\r\n\r\n  The requisite qualifications for becoming members of the Institution\r\nare the following, viz: That the candidate be of good moral character,\r\nthat he be able to read and spell correctly, to write a fair, legible\r\nhand, and work the ground rules of arithmetic.\r\n\r\n  COURSE OF INSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n  Young gentlemen destined for a college education, can be prepared at\r\nthis seminary for admission into any college or university in the\r\ncountry, either as freshmen, or one or two years in advance, and in the\r\nmean time will be enabled to acquire a good military and practical\r\nscientific education. Young gentlemen also, destined for the navy, can\r\nhere be instructed in the scientific part of their profession, and at\r\nthe same time, obtain a correct knowledge of fortification, and of\r\nmilitary operations generally, on land, which it is believed they would\r\nfind highly useful in future life. Parents and guardians who are\r\ndesirous of placing their sons or wards at this seminary, are requested\r\nto state whether they wish them to go through with the full course of\r\neducation; and if not, to specify, particularly, those branches to which\r\nthey desire them to attend, and also to mention their ages.\r\n\r\n  The course of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, French, and English languages,\r\nArithmetic, the construction and use of Logarithms, Algebra, Geometry,\r\nPlane and Spherical Trigonometry, Planometry, Stereometry, Mensuration\r\nof heights and distances by Trigonometry, and also Geometrically,\r\npractical Geometry generally, including particularly Surveying and\r\nLeveling, Conic Sections, the use of the Barometer, with its application\r\nto measuring the altitudes of mountains and other eminences, Mechanics,\r\nHydrostatics, Hydraulics, the elements of Chemistry and Electricity,\r\nOptics, Astronomy, Navigation, Geography, including the use of Maps and\r\nthe Globes; Composition, Logic, History, Ethics, the elements of Natural\r\nand Political Law, the Law of Nations, Military Law, the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, and of the states severally, Metaphysics;\r\nAgriculture, Permanent and Field Fortification, Field Engineering\r\ngenerally, the construction of Marine Batteries, Artillery duty, the\r\nprinciples of Gunnery, a complete course of Military Tactics, the attack\r\nand defense of fortified places, Castrametation, ancient Fortification,\r\nthe ancient modes of attacking and defending fortified places, the\r\nancient Tactics, particularly those of the Greeks and Romans, with a\r\ndescription of the organization and discipline of the phalanx and\r\nlegion; Book-Keeping, Music, Fencing, Military Drawing, Topography,\r\nCivil Engineering, including the construction of Roads, Canals, Locks,\r\nand Bridges; Architecture.\r\n\r\n  The Hebrew and French languages, Fencing and Music will not be\r\nconsidered as comprised in the regular course of education, and\r\nconsequently those who attend to them will be charged separately.\r\n\r\n  MILITARY EXERCISE, AND DUTIES.\r\n\r\n  The students will be regularly and correctly instructed in the\r\nelementary school of the soldier, and also in those of the company and\r\nbattalion; they will likewise be taught the regular formation of\r\nmilitary parades, the turning off, mounting, and relieving guards and\r\nsentinels; the duties of officers of the guard, officers of the day, and\r\nadjutants; the making out correctly the different descriptions of\r\nmilitary reports; in fine, all the duties incident to the field or\r\ngarrison. The military exercises and duties will be so arranged as not\r\nto occupy any of the time that would otherwise be devoted to study; they\r\nwill be attended to at those hours of the day which are generally passed\r\nby students in idleness, or devoted to useless amusements, for which\r\nthey will be made a pleasing and healthful substitute. Practical\r\nscientific operations will be frequently attended to, which will conduce\r\nequally to health and improvement.\r\n\r\n  The students will be required to sleep on matrasses, or straw-beds; no\r\nfeather-beds will be allowed in the establishment.\r\n\r\n  For the purpose of giving to the students a military appearance, when\r\nengaged on military duty, and also on a principle of economy, they are\r\nrequired to wear a uniform dress, a description of which is hereunto\r\nannexed. In prescribing a dress, it has been endeavored to combine as\r\nfar as possible, cheapness and a neat military appearance, with such a\r\nform as, while it leaves the student the free and unrestrained use of\r\nhis limbs, will at the same time encumber him the least possible. The\r\ndiscipline will be strict, but correct; and particular attention will be\r\ngiven to the full development and due cultivation of all those liberal,\r\nmanly, noble and independent sentiments which ought to characterize\r\nevery American, whether citizen or soldier. The strictest attention will\r\nbe given to the health, manners and morals of the students. They will be\r\ncontinually under the personal inspection of the superintendent, who\r\nwill bestow upon them all that care and attention which it is believed\r\ntheir parents, under similar circumstances, would bestow.\r\n\r\n  MILITARY LECTURES.\r\n\r\n  For the accommodation of gentlemen, (particularly of those holding\r\ncommissions in the volunteer corps and militia,) who may not wish to go\r\nthrough with a regular course of military studies and instruction, and\r\nalso for the purpose of diffusing military science more generally, Capt.\r\nPartridge will deliver annually at the before-mentioned seminary, three\r\ncourses of public lectures; the first course to commence on the second\r\nMonday in May, the second course on the second Monday in July, and the\r\nthird course on the first Monday in October, annually. These lectures\r\nwill embrace the following branches of military science and instruction,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n  1st. Permanent and field fortification, the construction of field\r\nworks generally, and also of marine batteries.\r\n\r\n  2d. The attack and defense of fortified places.\r\n\r\n  3d. The use of artillery, with a general exposition of the principles\r\nof gunnery.\r\n\r\n  4th. Military Tactics.\r\n\r\n  5th. Garrison and field service of troops, embracing particularly\r\ntheir police and rules for turning off, mounting and relieving guards\r\nand sentinels, and also for guard duty, likewise castrametation.\r\n\r\n  6th. General rules for the attack and defense of a province or country\r\nembracing an exposition of the principles of base lines of operation.\r\n\r\n  7th. Rules for the inspection and review of troops.\r\n\r\n  8th. A summary of ancient fortification, and also of the ancient modes\r\nof attacking and defending fortified places.\r\n\r\n  9th. A summary of the ancient tactics, particularly those of the\r\nGreeks and Romans.\r\n\r\n  10th. A description of some of the most celebrated battles and sieges,\r\nboth of ancient and modern times, for the purpose of practically\r\nillustrating the principles explained in the lectures. In order to\r\nrender the lectures on fortification perfectly intelligible, plans will\r\nbe prepared, on which the several parts of a work will be clearly and\r\ndistinctly exhibited.\r\n\r\n  Particular attention will be given to a full explanation of all the\r\ntechnical terms used in fortification, as well as in the other\r\ndepartments of military science. A full course will comprise about\r\ntwenty lectures; five to be delivered in each week until the course be\r\nfinished. The terms for attending a course will be ten dollars.\r\nGentlemen subscribing for two courses, will be allowed ever after to\r\nattend gratis. All those attending the lectures, will be entitled,\r\nduring the time of such attendance, to practical military instruction,\r\nand also to the privilege of the reading-room, without any additional\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of April, 1825, Capt. Partridge was induced by liberal\r\novertures from citizens of Middletown, Conn., to leave his institution\r\nat Norwich, and remove to Middletown, Conn., and reopen it in that city.\r\nBefore doing so he published a card in which he exhibits the progress\r\nand results of his labors at Norwich.\r\n\r\n  This seminary was opened at Norwich, in the state of Vermont, on the\r\n4th of September, 1820, under my immediate direction and\r\nsuperintendence; and although the plan was new and untried, besides\r\ncontaining principles, which were by many considered discordant with\r\neach other, viz., the connecting of mental improvement with a regular\r\ncourse of bodily exercise, and the full development of the physical\r\npowers, the whole conducted under a military system of discipline; still\r\nits success has exceeded, rather than fallen short, of my most sanguine\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\n  The following extract from a recent report of the adjutant of the\r\ninstitution, compiled from the rolls and other authentic documents, will\r\nenable the public to form their conclusions, from facts on this subject.\r\n\r\n  1st. The total number of cadets who have joined the institution, since\r\nits organization, is 480.\r\n\r\n  2d. The numbers from the respective states, and other sections\r\nhereafter mentioned, are as follows, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    From Maine,               28\r\n         Massachusetts,       89\r\n         New Hampshire,       57\r\n         Vermont,            115\r\n         Connecticut,         33\r\n         Rhode Island,        10\r\n         New York,            40\r\n         Pennsylvania,        15\r\n         New Jersey,           6\r\n         Delaware,             2\r\n         Maryland,             4\r\n         Virginia,             1\r\n         North Carolina,       7\r\n         South Carolina,      45\r\n         Kentucky,             2\r\n         Georgia,              7\r\n         Ohio,                 1\r\n         Louisiana,            4\r\n         Mississippi,          5\r\n         Missouri,             1\r\n         Michigan,             2\r\n         District of Columbia, 2\r\n         Lower Canada,         2\r\n         Havana, Island Cuba,  1\r\n         Island Scio, Greece,  1\r\n\r\n  3dly. Of the above number, twenty are commissioned and warrant\r\nofficers of the U.S. Navy, viz., 4 lieutenants, 1 assistant-surgeon, and\r\n15 midshipmen.\r\n\r\n  4thly. Out of the whole, 441 have been engaged in the study of the\r\nMathematics, and out of this number 145 have completed a full course of\r\n“_Hutton’s Mathematics_.” Of these, 80 have, in addition, attended to\r\npractical Mathematics, 56 have continued their course through the study\r\nof Philosophy, and others are now fast progressing in the accomplishment\r\nof those higher branches also.\r\n\r\n  5thly. The whole number who have studied the Greek and Latin\r\nlanguages, is about 150. Of these, 25 have advanced far towards\r\ncompleting a course, although none have gone entirely through. Of those\r\nnot included in the last-mentioned number, many have fitted for college,\r\nor progressed still farther, and many are progressing. What is here\r\nconsidered a course, is the same which is laid down in the prospectus,\r\nwhich could be scarcely completed in the period since the establishment\r\nof the institution.\r\n\r\n  6thly. The number of those who have attended to the French language,\r\nis about 130. Twenty have become well acquainted with the language--30\r\nare very well advanced, and many of the remainder have made respectable\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n  7thly. About ten or twelve of those who have been, or are now members\r\nof the institution, have devoted considerable time and instruction of\r\nthe militia or volunteer corps, in this and various other sections of\r\nthe country, and many of them are still engaged in that useful\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n  Of those who have been, or are now, engaged in the study of the Latin\r\nand Greek languages, I flatter myself there are several who would not\r\nsuffer by a comparison with any of the same degree of advancement at our\r\nolder and most approved seminaries; and as a school of practical\r\nscience, I have little hesitation in asserting, that it is second to\r\nnone in our country. In confirmation of this assertion, I would observe,\r\nthat since the establishment of the seminary, my pupils, in addition to\r\ntheir usual exercises in practical geometry, and many operations of\r\nminor consequence, have executed, in a very handsome manner, a profile\r\nof the country, exhibiting the perpendicular altitudes of all the\r\nprominent points, above tide water, as determined by actual observation,\r\nfrom the summit of Manchester mountain, in the state of Vermont, to the\r\nsummit of mount Washington, the highest elevation of the White\r\nMountains, in the state of New Hampshire, a distance of 165 miles. They\r\nhave also executed a similar profile from Norwich to Whitehall, in the\r\nstate of New York, a distance of sixty-eight miles, and have further\r\nexecuted a trigonometrical survey of the country around Norwich, for a\r\ndistance in some directions, of about twenty miles. This survey was\r\ncommenced, and has been prosecuted, in such a manner as to serve as a\r\nbasis for any further operations that may be thought necessary.\r\nA handsome topographical plan of this survey is finished.\r\n\r\n  In the department of French, it is believed, the pupils have made as\r\nrapid progress as at any seminary in our country, and in Mineralogy,\r\nBotany, &c., although but recently commenced, there appears to be much\r\nzeal, and a corresponding improvement, amongst the classes which have\r\nattended, and those still attending, numbering about sixty.\r\n\r\n  Music and fencing have been attended by a large proportion of the\r\nmembers, and with a progress highly creditable to them.\r\n\r\n  The military exercises and duties are common to all the cadets, and it\r\nis believed very few have left the seminary, who were not competent to\r\ninstruct from the elementary drill of the soldier, to embrace the school\r\nof the battalion, and who, in addition, did not possess a very competent\r\nknowledge of the principles of the grand tactics, of the elements of\r\npermanent and field fortification, of the principles of gunnery, &c. The\r\nbeneficial effects of the regular system of exercise and active duty, to\r\nwhich my pupils are subject, upon their health, has been fully equal to\r\nmy expectations. But one death has happened at the institution, since\r\nits commencement; and this was a youth who had just entered his name on\r\nthe rolls, but was attacked by a prevailing epidemic, of which he died,\r\nbefore commencing his studies or regular duties. Several who joined the\r\nseminary feeble and debilitated, have in a short time been entirely\r\nrestored to vigorous health. Indeed, such has been the result,\r\nI believe, without a single exception. That a youth may, by means of a\r\nregular system of exercise, preserve all his bodily activity and vigor,\r\nand at the same time apply himself most assiduously to study, I have\r\nnever had any doubts; but if I had, the facts developed since the\r\nestablishment of this seminary, would have dispelled them. Many of my\r\npupils, and those the closest applicants to study, walk with facility\r\nforty miles per day. In the summer of 1823, several of them left Norwich\r\nat day-break in the morning, walked to the summit of Ascutney mountain,\r\nand returned to Norwich about 9 o’clock in the evening of the same\r\nday--the whole distance forty-six miles: which, considering the fatigue\r\nand difficulty of ascending and descending the mountain, (upwards of\r\n3,000 feet high,) may reasonably be estimated as equivalent to sixty\r\nmiles on the usual roads of the country. They continued their regular\r\nstudies and other duties the following day. In September, 1823, a party\r\nof nearly thirty accompanied me on a pedestrian tour to the summit of\r\nManchester mountain, in the state of Vermont, a large portion of whom\r\ntraveled 150 miles in four days, and on the fourth day one of the party,\r\na youth of sixteen years of age, walked by my side forty-five miles. On\r\na recent excursion, to the summit of the most elevated of the White\r\nMountains, with a party of fifty of my pupils, a large portion of them,\r\non the last day, walked forty-two miles. Belonging to this party, was a\r\nyouth of but twelve years of age, who walked the whole distance, (160\r\nmiles,) carrying his knapsack, with clothes, &c., and returned in\r\nperfect health.\r\n\r\n  Since the latter part of June, 1821, the cadets, as a military corps,\r\nhave executed, under my personal command, six military marches,\r\namounting, in the aggregate, to 637 miles. Different detachments from\r\nthe corps have also, within the same time, in addition to several of\r\nminor importance, performed, under my personal direction, four\r\npedestrian excursions, for practical scientific purposes, amounting in\r\nthe aggregate to 684 miles, and which, added to the former, gives\r\n637×684=1321 miles. To this may be added an excursion to the White\r\nMountains, whole distance 170 miles, by a party which I did not\r\naccompany, and which will make the total distance traveled in those\r\nmarches and excursions, 1491 miles.\r\n\r\n  The foregoing facts are stated for the purpose of illustrating and\r\nconfirming the correctness of the opinion I have so often advanced in my\r\nlectures on education, relative to the practicability, and even\r\nfacility, of combining the full development and perfection of the\r\nphysical powers of youth, with a due cultivation and improvement of the\r\nmental faculties. Whether a young man, who enters on the grand theater\r\nof active life, with a mind and body equally vigorous and improved, who,\r\nwhile he has a head to conceive, possesses also an arm to execute, will\r\nor will not possess advantages in the discharge of the various duties he\r\nmay be called upon to perform, over one, who has grown to the age of\r\nmanhood, puny and debilitated, destitute of physical energy, and\r\nincapable of bodily exertion, I shall leave to the sound discretion of\r\nthe American people to decide.\r\n\r\n  As it respects the effect of the system on the morals of youth,\r\nI would observe, that I feel confident no one has left the institution\r\nworse than he joined it, and that I flatter myself, several have, in\r\nthis respect, been improved. Next after the influence of religion,\r\nI consider habits of industry and economy as constituting the surest\r\nbasis of morals amongst youth. To instill these into the minds of my\r\npupils, ever has, and ever will be, a leading object; and I consequently\r\nshall imperatively require the strictest adherence to ail the\r\nregulations bearing on those points, by all concerned. I would therefore\r\nbeg leave to assure the parents, guardians, and relatives of my pupils,\r\nthat the regulations prohibiting the cadets being furnished with money,\r\notherwise than by the superintendent, or by his express permission, is\r\nto be taken in its literal meaning, (without exception,) and must be\r\nadhered to under all circumstances; and that any deviation from it will\r\nbe followed by immediate dismission. I would much prefer that the great\r\nbody of my pupils should enter young, and grow up under my system. The\r\nmind and body are then more susceptible of improvement, than at a more\r\nadvanced period. Few, if any, vicious habits have then been formed, and\r\nthe morals, under a strict and regular discipline, may easily be\r\npreserved. It is my fixed determination not, knowingly, to admit any\r\nyoung man of confirmed vicious or dissipated habits into the\r\ninstitution. I would accordingly recommend to parents and guardians not\r\nto send me any of this description; for if they should gain admission,\r\nand did not immediately reform, (which seldom occurs when the habits are\r\nconfirmed,) it would only eventuate in their dismission, and consequent\r\ndisgrace. It is much easier to prevent a youth from acquiring bad\r\nhabits, than to correct them after they are acquired. If parents and\r\nguardians will send me their sons and wards free from habits of\r\ndissipation, immorality, and vice, I will guarantee, as far as human\r\nagency will authorize, that they shall be preserved free from such\r\nhabits, while they remain under my care. Every requisite means will be\r\nused to correct the foibles and faults incidental to youth--to\r\naccomplish this object no pains will be spared. With their foibles I\r\nwill bear as much as any person, but with their vices I will make no\r\ncompromise. For the purpose of enabling me the more readily and the more\r\ncertainly to accomplish this important object, I must request parents\r\nand guardians, if their sons or wards have foibles or faults, frankly to\r\nstate them to me. On this subject there should be no reserve; as, with\r\nsuch information, I should know much better what course to pursue with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe favorable view taken of the aims, progress, and results of the\r\nscientific and military training provided by Capt. Partridge in his\r\nAcademy at Norwich, was amply justified by the success of his pupils at\r\nMiddletown, as practical men in various departments of business and\r\npublic life.\r\n\r\nOn account of the condition on which he held a portion of his property\r\nat Norwich, Capt. Partridge was obliged to maintain there a literary\r\ninstitution, after his removal to Middletown. When he discontinued his\r\nlabors at the latter place, and not succeeding in his plans for\r\nestablishing a scientific and military school in the neighborhood of New\r\nYork, he returned to Norwich, and in 1832, made preparation to\r\nreëstablish his Academy on its old basis, and with enlarged premises.\r\nWith this view he erected the building known as the North Barracks,\r\nwhich were occupied for two years by Rev. Amasa Buck, for the purposes\r\nof a Methodist school, known as the Franklin Seminary.\r\n\r\nNORWICH UNIVERSITY.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1834, a number of gentlemen associated to establish at\r\nNorwich, not an academic, but a collegiate institution, after Capt.\r\nPartridge’s views, and in the autumn of that year, obtained from the\r\nLegislature of Vermont, a charter by which the petitioners were\r\nconstituted a Board of Trustees of an institution by the name of the\r\n_Norwich University_. The charter further provides “that the said Board\r\nshall be required to furnish at said institution constantly a course of\r\nMilitary instruction, both theoretical and practical, and also in Civil\r\nEngineering, and the practical sciences generally; and the President of\r\nsaid institution, with the consent of the Trustees, _shall have power to\r\ngive and confer all such diplomas, degrees, honors, or licenses, as are\r\nusually given or conferred in Colleges or Universities_, at their\r\ndiscretion; provided, however, that in so doing they shall have respect\r\nto the morals and merits of the candidate alone.”\r\n\r\nThis act of incorporation named fourteen gentlemen, and provided for the\r\nelection of eleven others, which twenty-five should constitute the Board\r\nof Trustees of Norwich University. The first meeting of the Trustees was\r\nheld at Norwich, Vt., January, 1835. The vacancies in the Board were\r\nthen filled, and the first members of the Faculty were elected,\r\nviz.:--ALDEN PARTRIDGE, “President and Professor of Moral and\r\nIntellectual Philosophy, History, Science of Government, Political\r\nEconomy, and Military Science and Tactics;” TRUMAN B. RANSOM,\r\nVice-President, and Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy,\r\nMathematics, Theoretical and Practical, and Civil Engineering; M. NORAS,\r\nProfessor of Ancient and Modern Languages; and FRANKLIN MARSH and I. M.\r\nHORR, assistants in the English Department. These gentlemen were\r\nauthorized to form a course of study and laws for the government of the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1835, the University was opened under the auspices and in the\r\nbuildings owned by Capt. Partridge, with a full course of literary,\r\nscientific, and military studies. Among those enumerated in the first\r\nprospectus were Military Law, Military Drawing, Civil and Military\r\nEngineering. “Military Science being considered an important appendage\r\nto the education of every American youth is taught theoretically in all\r\ndepartments of the University. The military exercises are attended at\r\nthose hours of the day which are generally passed by students in\r\nidleness or devoted to useless amusements, for which they will be made a\r\npleasing and healthful substitute.” “The discipline will be strict, but\r\ncorrect; in principle, military. It will be a great and leading object\r\nto instill into the minds of students liberality of sentiment and\r\nprinciples of honorable integrity and attachment to our republican\r\ninstitutions. Everything of a sectarian character in religion will be\r\nentirely excluded and all literary honors will be conferred in\r\naccordance with scholarship and moral worth alone.”\r\n\r\nAt the close of the academic year, 1835-6, (August 18, 1836,) the first\r\nAnnual Commencement took place, and the class of 1836 then graduated,\r\nconsisted of one person, Alonzo Jackman, now Brigadier-General in\r\nVermont, and Professor of Mathematics, Military Science, etc., at the\r\nUniversity. Professor Ransom, entered the United States Navy about this\r\ntime, and Mr. Jackman was appointed to fill the vacant Professorship.\r\nSoon after this, Rev. Zerah Colburn, succeeded Professor Noras. August\r\n17, 1837, the second Annual Commencement was held, and Hon. George\r\nMcDuffie, of South Carolina, delivered the address; the next year Robert\r\nRantoul, Jr., of Massachusetts, was the orator; in 1839, John Wentworth,\r\nof Illinois, and Thomas H. Seymour, of Connecticut, were speakers; and\r\nin 1840, Benjamin F. Hallett, of Boston. The catalogues of each of these\r\nyears show that the number of students, or cadets, averaged a little\r\nless than a hundred, and in all the catalogues, the regulations for the\r\nPolice of the Cadets’ Quarters were given in full. They provided for all\r\nthe military duties of the students, for the wearing of uniform, etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1840, the Corps of the University under the command of Captain\r\nPartridge, performed a military march across the State to Fort\r\nTiconderoga. They were just a week on the excursion, and in that time,\r\nthey marched nearly a hundred and fifty miles on foot, about twenty-five\r\nmiles per day. Notwithstanding the excessive warmth of the day, and the\r\nexposure to the air of the night, with no other covering than the\r\nsoldiers’ blanket, the Cadets all returned in good health and spirits.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1843, several changes took place in the University. From\r\nthe time Mr. Ransom resigned the Vice-Presidency, until May, 1843, that\r\noffice was filled by Hon. Aaron Loveland. Mr. Ransom returned at this\r\ntime, and was again made Vice-President, and Professor of Civil and\r\nMilitary Engineering, etc. The buildings and land used up to this time,\r\nwere the property of Capt. Partridge. During May, arrangements were made\r\nfor the purchase of this property by the University, but some\r\nmisunderstanding occurred before this was done, and in November,\r\nPresident Partridge resigned, and took from the armory all the arms and\r\naccoutrements, attempted to revive his old Academy in another part of\r\nthe village, and finally, when the University could not purchase his\r\nproperty at his prices, obliged the students to remove from the\r\nbuildings. On his resignation, Truman B. Ransom was chosen President,\r\nand for the two years the institution was carried on in other buildings\r\nin the town. The Legislature was applied to, and appropriated a hundred\r\nstand of arms, sets of accoutrements, etc., for the use of the students.\r\nAt last an arrangement was made with Capt. Partridge, for the purchase\r\nof his property, and the University returned to its old quarters. The\r\nnumber of students was small during these difficulties, but the military\r\ndepartment was always active, a good military education was given, and\r\nmen were graduated who now hold responsible places in the military\r\nservice of the United States among the Federal troops.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1847, President Ransom, then Major-General of the Vermont\r\nMilitia, resigned his place at the University, accepted that of Colonel\r\nof the “New England regiment,” ninth infantry, and went with that body\r\nto Mexico. September 13th of the same year, he was shot while gallantly\r\nleading the charge of his regiment upon the fortifications of\r\nChapultepec. When Gen. Ransom left, Prof. James D. Butler was appointed\r\nPresident _pro tem._, and in January, 1848, Gen. Henry S. Wheaton, of\r\nMassachusetts, was elected President, and served as such till August,\r\n1849; he was succeeded in September, 1850, by Rev. Edward Bourns, LL.\r\nD., who still (1863,) holds that office.\r\n\r\nSoon after 1850, the opposition to anything of a military education\r\nbecame very strong, the number of Cadets at this institution diminished,\r\nand the tone of the prospectus changed to suit the public. “The\r\ndiscipline is military in principle and form. The Cadets are under\r\nmilitary organization, they dress in uniform, are regularly drilled with\r\narms. But they are not made lovers of war! They are not found to adopt\r\nthe profession of arms more than others of the same age, however\r\neducated; oftentimes the harmless practice of handling arms at this age,\r\nis found to satisfy the craving for the use of them, and these young men\r\nsettle down into the ranks of peace more easily and more contentedly\r\nthan those that have had no such training. The drill is an agreeable\r\nexercise. The system of discipline is strict, though not oppressive, its\r\nsole object is to preserve order and promote study.” “The object is not\r\nto make soldiers, but to strengthen the body.” During these years (from\r\n1850 to 1860,) the prospects of the University were not bright. It was\r\nat once engaged in lawsuits, and troubled with debt and opposition. In\r\n1853, it was proposed to move the University to Montpelier, but the\r\nproject was finally abandoned, the last of the old Academy property was\r\nbought, the buildings were repaired and the institution freed from debt.\r\nPrevious to 1850, the finances were in a very confused state. When the\r\ncharter was obtained, land to the value of fifteen hundred dollars was\r\nbrought and deeded to the University. The sale of this, and\r\nsubscriptions from Trustees and citizens of Norwich, produced enough to\r\npurchase the North Barracks. The money received of students for tuition\r\nwas always, and is still, all used for paying the salaries of the\r\ninstructors. The room-rents scarcely paid the rent and repairs of the\r\nSouth Barracks, and the University ran slightly into debt. The State, in\r\n1853-4, gave the institution about thirteen hundred dollars of an\r\nunappropriated school fund, and enough more was raised by friends of the\r\nUniversity to purchase the South Barracks, and pay off old debts, and\r\nput all the buildings in good repair. For several years it was obliged\r\nto struggle against a load of popular prejudice on account of its\r\nmilitary feature, but since 1861, it has brushed up its uniform, and its\r\nMilitary Department no longer seeks to hide itself. No such\r\nsemi-apologies for the military training of its students appear in its\r\ncatalogues and prospectus for 1861 and 1862.\r\n\r\n“The Norwich University differs from most colleges in two respects.\r\nThese are its double system of study, consisting in an Academic and a\r\nScientific course; and its department of Military Science. The Academic\r\ncourse comprises those studies usually pursued in other colleges; the\r\nScientific embraces Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Belles-Lettres,\r\nSurveying, and Engineering. Four years are required to complete the\r\nformer, and three, the latter course of study. Students are also allowed\r\nto take a partial course in either department. The students of all\r\ndepartments are regarded as equals.\r\n\r\n“The feature, however, which more than any other distinguishes Norwich\r\nUniversity from other Collegiate institutions, is the department of\r\nMilitary Science and Tactics.\r\n\r\n“Agreeably to the provisions of its charter, the students are all under\r\nMilitary discipline--are called Cadets--dress in uniform, and are\r\ninstructed in Infantry, Rifle, and Artillery Drill, Bayonet Exercise,\r\nFortification, Reconnoissance, Castrametation, Guard and Out-Post duty,\r\n&c., &c. All the arms and equipments necessary for drills are furnished\r\nby the State of Vermont. * * *\r\n\r\n“The military feature of this institution is one which should\r\nparticularly commend it to the notice, and patronage of the public at\r\nthis time. The want of men skilled in Military Science and Tactics, to\r\ntake command of volunteer forces, and discipline them into effective\r\nsoldiers, has been severely felt in organizing the present army of the\r\nUnited States. The reverses with which it has met are, without doubt,\r\nowing largely to this cause. To guard against this defect in the future,\r\nit is now generally felt that young men should be educated thoroughly in\r\nevery department of Military Science. In times of peace this knowledge\r\nwould not incapacitate men for nor interfere with any other\r\nbusiness;--while in times of war, it would become invaluable to the\r\ncountry in training an army for efficient service.”\r\n\r\nThe following persons constituted the Faculty in 1862. Rev. EDWARD\r\nBOURNS, LL. D., President, and Professor of Moral Sciences, Ancient\r\nLanguages, and Literature; ALONZO JACKMAN, A.M., Brigadier-General\r\nVermont Volunteer Militia, Professor of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy,\r\nMilitary Science, and Tactics; THOMAS R. CROSBY, M.D., Professor of\r\nAnatomy, Physiology, and Natural History; CLINTON S. AVERILL, A.M.,\r\nActing Professor of Natural Sciences; GEORGE BAILLARD, Professor of\r\nModern Languages, and Linear and Architectural Drawing; SAMUEL W.\r\nSHATTUCK, B.S., Tutor in Mathematics and Military Tactics; ALONZO\r\nJACKMAN, A.M., Librarian.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY ELEMENT IN SCHOOLS OF ALL GRADES.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nIn all ages and in all countries there have been educators who\r\nrecognized the importance of the physical, and more specifically, of the\r\nmilitary element in their schemes of individual and collective teaching.\r\nNo higher authority in English pedagogical literature of the liberal\r\ntype, can be named in this connection, than John Milton, who, in his\r\nbrief but masterly outline of “a virtuous and noble education,” includes\r\nthis in the means of a complete and generous culture, that is “to fit a\r\nman to perform justly, skillfully, and magnanimously all the offices,\r\nboth private and public, of peace and war.” In the outset he demands\r\nthat the number of pupils, for whose accommodations a spacious house and\r\ngrounds were to be provided, should be large enough for “the convenience\r\nof a foot company or interchangeably two troops of cavalry,” so that\r\nsystematic exercise could alternate with the studies and diet. In his\r\ngeneral programme he includes studies which shall “stir up their spirits\r\nto manly and liberal exercise,” and “inflame their hearts with high\r\nhopes of living to be brave men and worthy patriots.” In the enumeration\r\nof studies he specifies mathematics, the practical aid of instruments in\r\nsurveying and engineering, and their application to fortification and\r\nnavigation. Living in the midst of a civil war like our own, when the\r\npreservation of constitutional liberty had summoned troops from the\r\nfield, the shop, and the study, and placed men in command who had not\r\nbeen trained to the profession of arms, Milton directs or points out the\r\nvalue of studies, the mastery of whose general principles “may at some\r\ntime or other save an army, and not let the healthy and stout bodies of\r\nyoung men rot away under them for want of this discipline, which is a\r\ngreat pity, and no less shame to the commander.” In treating specially\r\nof physical culture, Milton assigns to military drill, and use of sword\r\nand other weapons, at least an hour and a half each day, that his pupils\r\nmay be equally good both for peace and war. “The exercise which I\r\ncommend first is the exact use of these weapons to guard and strike\r\nsafely with edge or point. This will keep them healthy, nimble, strong,\r\nand well in breath; is also the likeliest means to make them grow large\r\nand tall, and to inspire them with a gallant and fearless courage, which\r\nbeing tempered with seasonable lectures and precepts to make them of\r\ntrue fortitude and patience, will turn into a native and heroic valor,\r\nand makes them hate the cowardice of doing wrong.” With the use of the\r\nsword Milton would associate all athletic sports “wherein Englishmen are\r\napt to excel.” And after the day’s study has been thoroughly done, “with\r\nminds in good tune and satisfaction,” he would occupy the “two hours\r\nbefore supper in military motions, under sky, or cover, according to the\r\nseason, as was the Roman wont; first on foot, then as their age permits,\r\non horseback to all the art of cavalry; that having in spirit, but with\r\nmuch exactness and daily muster, served out the rudiments of their\r\nsoldiership in the skill of embattling, marching, encamping, fortifying,\r\nbesieging and battering, with all the helps of ancient and modern\r\nstrategems, tactics, and warlike maxims, they may, as it were, out of a\r\nlong war come forth renowned and perfect commanders in the service of\r\ntheir country. They would not then if they were trusted with fair and\r\nhopeful armies, suffer them for want of just and wise discipline to shed\r\naway from about them like sick feathers, though they be never so oft\r\nsupplied; they would not suffer these empty and unrecruitable colonels\r\nto quaff out or convey into secret hoards the wages of a delusive list\r\nand miserable remnant. No, certainly, if they knew aught of that\r\nknowledge which belongs to good men or good governors, they would not\r\nsuffer these things.” To these school studies and practical exercises,\r\nMilton would add excursions “to all quarters of the land, learning and\r\nobserving all places of strength, all material for building, all soil\r\nfor towns and tillage, harbors and ports of trade. These ways would try\r\nall their peculiar gifts of Nature, and if there is any secret\r\nexcellence among them, would fetch it out and give it fair opportunities\r\nto advance itself by.”\r\n\r\nThe views of Milton in favor of military exercises can not be attributed\r\nto any professional bias, for his tastes and his habits of life were in\r\nthe shaded walks of the academy, “contemplating the serene countenance\r\nof truth in the still air of delightful study.”\r\n\r\nThe example of Switzerland can be cited on the side of their\r\npracticality, on a scale as liberal and much more popular than their\r\nauthor at the time contemplated; and quite recently (1871), the Federal\r\nwar authorities propose that the older boys in the secondary and\r\nsuperior schools shall be instructed in outpost and skirmishing duties.\r\n\r\nX. PHYSICAL AND MILITARY EXERCISES IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nA NATIONAL NECESSITY\r\n\r\nBY EDWARD L. MOLINEUX\r\n\r\nMajor and Inspector in New York Militia.\r\n\r\nFrom a long and unexampled period of political and commercial prosperity\r\nwe suddenly find ourselves called upon to struggle for national\r\nexistence, and while a noble response from the people to the necessity\r\nof the struggle has strengthened the hand of government with an\r\nintelligent army, and developed the resources of the country, yet the\r\noccasion has laid bare defects which call for correction.\r\n\r\nWithout a standing army of any magnitude we have found our militia laws\r\ndefective, and have been obliged to create ourselves a military people\r\nby the sufferings and bitterness of an experience bought on the field of\r\nactive warfare.\r\n\r\nMilitary necessity has compelled the loss of invaluable time in the\r\norganizing and preparing of our troops, which would not have been\r\nrequired had we been able to meet the rebellion at the commencement with\r\nwell trained officers and an experienced and carefully drilled militia.\r\n\r\n“_The first object_” says Daniel Webster, “_of a free people is the\r\npreservation of their liberty:_” a noble truth which must speak home to\r\nthe heart of every American, and if, as it is asserted, “the future life\r\nand character of a nation is to be seen in its system of schools,” then\r\nwe may well listen with some degree of alarm to the warnings and\r\nunmistakable evidences by which we are surrounded, that the American\r\nrace is physically deteriorating.[22]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: Miss C. E. Beecher’s “Appeal to American Women,”\r\n    “Calisthenics,” &c.]\r\n\r\nThe question arises, has our National system of Education been such as\r\nto qualify and prepare us to maintain successfully, the noble\r\ninheritance which was won by the physical energies of the men of the\r\nRevolution, and with our success in the field of intellectual culture,\r\nhave we kept the physical advantages possessed by our forefathers?\r\n\r\nLet us not mislead ourselves in this matter, but calmly look at the\r\nfacts, that as a rule, our present system of Public Education is devoted\r\n_solely_ to the mental and moral improvement of the scholars, and that\r\nthe encouragements and rewards held out by committees and teachers,\r\nstimulate to the overexertion of the brain, and sacrifice in too many\r\ninstances, the health and growth of the body.\r\n\r\nAlthough great improvement has been made of late by the shortening of\r\nthe time devoted to study, and by the introduction of more frequent\r\nperiods of recreation, yet still little has been attempted for giving\r\nexercise and activity to the body; this important training being left to\r\nthe care of parents or the pupils themselves.\r\n\r\nIs it not too true that the increase of ill health, broken\r\nconstitutions, and early deaths, among the growing portion of our\r\npopulation, especially in cities, warns us, year after year, that the\r\nthirst for knowledge, and the restless seeking after mental and\r\nintellectual improvement, have been bought at the expense of the vital\r\nenergies of the great body of youth who throng the colleges and public\r\nschools of our land?[23]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: [We do not share this alarm, or believe that hard\r\n    study, apart from open or secret vice, has had much, if any thing,\r\n    to do with such physical deterioration as does exist.-- ED. _Am.\r\n    Jour. of Ed._]]\r\n\r\nIf any one denies this, let him visit our institutions of learning, and\r\nwhile he may well admire the wisdom and forethought which has\r\nestablished our prosperity on a noble system of National Education, he\r\ncan not but notice the debility evinced in the frames of so many\r\nyouthful votaries of intellectual training; the exceptions making the\r\ncontrast still more strikingly painful. Then let him go to the\r\ncounting-house or the close confinement of some mechanical employment,\r\nwhere the evils from mental activity, unaccompanied by physical\r\nrecreation, are yet more strongly developed. These evils assail not only\r\nthe happiness of families, but the prosperity of the nation and the\r\nwell-being of the race. Is this right or necessary? Can it be avoided?\r\n\r\nThe solution of these momentous questions may well engage the serious\r\nattention of the reflecting teacher, parent and patriot; and to them we\r\nassert that, _unless physical exercises are enforced upon our system of\r\nPublic School education, our intellectual culture will be of little\r\navail, and that our nationality stands in danger of sinking a prey to\r\ndesigning opponents_.\r\n\r\nThat enfeebled races are invariably conquered by those more powerfully\r\ndeveloped, is proved by innumerable instances in history. That physical\r\ntraining was an important branch of education among the Greeks and\r\nRomans, is well known. The system inculcated by the iron-hearted\r\nLycurgus, among the Spartan youth, was of a nature admirably adapted to\r\nfit them for all the sterner realities of life, whilst the athletic\r\ngames and exercises of the youth of Rome, comprising, as it did,\r\nwalking, running, wrestling, swimming, and military drill, were the\r\nmeans of improving, to the utmost, their physical powers. Upon reaching\r\nmanhood, the advantage of this training was indicated by the robustness\r\nof form, and the constitutional vigor which enabled them to undertake\r\nlabor, fatigue and hardship of every kind, with perfect indifference.\r\n\r\nThe Spartan and the Roman soldiers were by this early training, not only\r\nqualified to surmount with ease the various obstacles and difficulties\r\nincident to a state of active warfare, but they also became gifted with\r\nprecision and rapidity in every movement, and each man was likewise\r\nendowed with that confidence in himself, and that unbounded reliance\r\nupon order, subordination and combined action, which nourish audacity,\r\nyet temper it with coolness and steadiness.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this system, by which the vigor and valor of a Spartan or\r\na Roman has passed into a proverb, fell into disuse, and as it was\r\nneglected for more intellectual pursuits, so the grand empires founded\r\nby its vigor crumbled before the assaults of more athletic barbarians.\r\n\r\nThe influence of health upon the faculties of the mind is acknowledged\r\nby all, and yet how few in this country devote attention to those all\r\nimportant exercises which are necessary to the preservation of health,\r\nand without which intellectual power can not be applied to its highest\r\nuse. The talents, the experience of our best educators of youth, are\r\ntaxed to devise exercises to develop the _mental_ faculties, forgetting\r\nthat too close application to study is detrimental to the growth of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nBut few thoughtful teachers will deny the extent to which this evil has\r\nreached, or be unwilling that the strain upon the intellectual powers of\r\nchildren, by absorbing studies, should be counteracted by cheerful and\r\nrelaxing exercises by which the mind will be relieved and at the same\r\ntime strengthened. The testimony of physicians, the valuable works on\r\nhealth by Dr. Warren, Miss C. E. Beecher, and many other able writers,\r\nfurnish incontestable evidence of the necessity of systematic exercise\r\nfor children. To accomplish this it is absolutely necessary to adopt it\r\nin our course of education, for in the majority of cases it can not, or\r\nwill not, be attended to at their homes.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the most simple, feasible and useful plan to adopt for\r\nphysical exercises in our Colleges, Normal and Public Schools?\r\n\r\nWe unhesitatingly say, that the only successful, orderly, and systematic\r\nmethod is, _to engraft them upon the course of studies during school\r\nhours, and to carry it out under strict military discipline_; the\r\nexercises being such as are best suited to the age, strength and\r\ncapabilities of the pupils, namely: calisthenics and walking for the\r\ngirls and younger children, and _military exercises_ for the elder boys.\r\n\r\nLet not the kind hearted parent exclaim against his boy learning the\r\nmilitary drill, for fear of his acquiring a taste for warfare; or the\r\nlover of peace imagine we would re-establish the stern laws of Lycurgus.\r\nWe would have moderation, in this respect as in mental studies, and\r\nwhile we would not, as some may imagine, displace the bust of Howard in\r\nour school rooms for a Napoleon, yet we would impress upon the minds of\r\nboys the image and example of Washington, and in cultivating their\r\nintellectual faculties, likewise prepare them in mind and body to\r\ndevelop in manhood those virtues and powers which constitute a true and\r\nnoble citizen;--a sincere love of country, of national probity and\r\njustice, beyond selfish considerations or personal aggrandizement They\r\nshould be brought up to a sense and knowledge that it will be their\r\nhonorable duty and privilege to protect their native land, that she\r\nfosters and educates them in their youth, and that upon their manhood\r\nher nationality depends.\r\n\r\nWe can never become an aggressive military people; the fields for\r\nsuccessful enterprise in art, science, commerce and agriculture, are too\r\nbroad and inviting to render military pursuits very attractive, and\r\nunless we cultivate such exercises and discipline in youth, they will\r\nbe, as they have been, neglected when engaged in the active pursuits of\r\nbusiness. The clear, common sense of the American parent will\r\nacknowledge, not only the national necessity, but the moral advantages\r\nof this; for what fond mother is there but would prefer to see in her\r\nson a manly, patriotic spirit, rather than a timid, mercenary one,\r\nwhich, shunning danger, would sacrifice the honor and greatness of his\r\ncountry to the base love of gain and ease.\r\n\r\nWe have suggested that the exercises be conducted under strict military\r\ndiscipline, because it is impossible for a large body of children to be\r\nexercised in the usual school limits, unless the greatest decorum and\r\norder is observed; and if conducted under the supervision of a teacher,\r\ndangers and accidents will be avoided, which always occur when children\r\nare rash and thoughtless in attempting to accomplish too much. Thus\r\nconducted, they will prove an invaluable aid to the teacher in the\r\nenforcement of discipline in the school room, and teach that invaluable\r\nlesson which it seems so difficult for children to learn,--unhesitating\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nFor the advantages of this system let us examine the practical testimony\r\nafforded in the European schools, where considerable attention has been\r\npaid to this important matter.\r\n\r\nOn the continent the advantages of physical training are appreciated to\r\ntheir fullest extent, especially in the Industrial Reform schools, where\r\nthe admirable principle has been adopted of teaching “what they will\r\nhave occasion to use when they become men,”[24] and thus render them\r\nuseful members of society. To Dr. Barnard’s National Education in\r\nEurope, we are indebted for the following extracts and illustrations of\r\nthis position.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: Aristippus.]\r\n\r\nIn the Reform School of Rauhen Haus, near Hamburg, “they are taught to\r\ndevelop their bodily and mental powers in various practical ways; to use\r\nthe fire engine, to swim, to save persons from drowning, and use\r\nremedies to recover them, to climb a mast and handle the sail, of a\r\nship. They act as a jury among themselves. Their chief reward is to be\r\nenrolled in the table of honor. In the great fire of Hamburg, their\r\nconduct was physically, as well as morally, heroic, and while bravely\r\nsaving life and property, they steadily refused rewards.” Parents who,\r\nperhaps justly owing to the numerous accidents in Gymnasiums, are timid\r\nof their children becoming injured by these exercises, should carefully\r\nread the system pursued in Fellenberg’s celebrated establishment at\r\nHofwyl. “A great variety of exercises of the body and the senses are\r\nemployed, so that every boy shall acquire a knowledge of his physical\r\nstrength, and attain confidence with regard to those efforts of which he\r\nis capable, instead of that foolhardiness which endangers the existence\r\nof many who have not learned to estimate their own powers correctly.” At\r\nRuysselde, Belgium, the following plan was pursued: In summer, from 5½\r\nto 6½ A.M., Exercises and Manœuvres; from 7½ to 8¾ P.M., Gymnastics. In\r\nwinter, several hours were devoted to these exercises, and the result\r\nfound (as in this report,) was, that “rickets, scrofula, want of\r\nelasticity in the limbs, difficulty of walking, all rapidly disappeared\r\nunder the drill, which confirmed the health and increased the strength\r\nand activity of the children, and accustomed them to discipline. It\r\npredisposed the pupils to sleep, and was an effective safeguard against\r\nshameful habits and secret vices. The battalion movements were performed\r\nwith as much precision as that of the army, a platoon armed with\r\ncondemned carbines, marched at the head. The bayonet exercises and\r\nskirmishing were as good as play to the boys.” A remarkable instance of\r\nthe moral effects of military discipline upon the lads of the _Colonie\r\nAgricole_, at Mettray, is related by M. Demetz, and was published in\r\nBarnard’s Journal, Vol. 1, p. 623. “During the revolution of 1848, a\r\nband of workmen came to Mettray, with flags flying and trumpets\r\nsounding, and meeting the youths returning, tired from field labor,\r\ntheir pickaxes on their shoulders, thus addressed them:--‘My boys, do\r\nnot be such fools as to work any longer. Bread is plentiful; it is ready\r\nfor you without labor.’ The _chef_, who was conducting the boys, and who\r\nbehaved with the greatest calmness and tact, immediately cried, ‘Halt!\r\nform in line,’ The lads, being accustomed to march like soldiers,\r\nimmediately formed. The _chef_ then said to the men, ‘My friends, you\r\nhave learned to labor; you have a right to rest; but leave these lads:\r\nlet them learn now, and when their turn comes they may rest as you do.’\r\nThe men gave way, the youths marched home, and Mettray was\r\nsaved,--saved, as I believe, by our habit of military discipline.” It\r\nwas the heroic exertions of these young _colons_ during the inundation\r\nof 1856, which won for them the praises of all France. These instances\r\nmight be multiplied, but are sufficient to show the moral and physical\r\nbenefits of military exercises and discipline upon boys, even of the\r\nlowest class.\r\n\r\nThe governments of Europe being upheld by the bayonets of large standing\r\narmies, and requiring, as they do, in many of the kingdoms, the\r\ncompulsory service of all young men, renders it unnecessary for the\r\ndaily public schools to teach military exercises to that extent, which\r\nit is well for our Republican government to do. Yet in Europe they watch\r\nwith the greatest assiduity and care the bodily powers of the children,\r\nknowing its great advantage not only in health, but the maintenance of\r\norder.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain much interest has of late been evinced on this subject,\r\nand Mr. Edwin Chadwick becoming convinced that the studies and\r\nconfinement in their schools were generally prolonged beyond the powers\r\nof the children, and in violation of the laws of health, devoted himself\r\nto collecting testimony respecting the advantages of the military drill\r\nupon the health of children. His investigations have elicited much\r\nvaluable information, the more interesting to us as they mark its\r\nadvantages to a nation which, like our own, depends for its defence\r\nmainly upon a volunteer force.\r\n\r\nThe following synopsis of his pamphlet we extract from the N.Y. Evening\r\nPost, November 1st:\r\n\r\nMr. Chadwick considers “In a sanitary point of view that a systematized\r\ndrill is good, and for defective constitutions requisite for the\r\ncorrection of congenital bodily defects and taints, with which the youth\r\nof a very large proportion of the population, especially among the\r\npoorer town populations, are affected: and that for these purposes the\r\nclimbing of masts, and other operations of the naval drill, and\r\nswimming, are valuable additions to the gymnastic exercises of the\r\nmilitary drill, and when properly taught are greatly liked by boys. From\r\na moral point of view, also, this drill will give the pupil an early\r\ninitiation into all the acquirements of discipline--namely, duty, order,\r\nobedience to command, self-restraint, punctuality and patience.”\r\n\r\nThe evidence furnished by English drill officers shows its national\r\nvalue, and “That at school it maybe taught most economically, as not\r\ninterfering with productive labor, and that thirty or forty boys may be\r\ntaught the naval and military drill at one penny farthing (two and a\r\nhalf cents) per week per head as cheaply as one man, and the whole\r\njuvenile population may be drilled completely in the juvenile stage, as\r\neconomically as the small part of it now taught imperfectly on\r\nrecruiting or in the adult stage; and that, for teaching the drill, the\r\nservices of retired drill sergeants, and naval as well as military\r\nofficers and pensioners, may be had economically in every part of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThat the middle and higher class schools should have, in addition to the\r\nfoot drill, the cavalry drill, which the parents of that class of pupils\r\nmay afford.\r\n\r\nThat the drill, when made generally prevalent, (without superseding,)\r\nwill eventually accomplish, in a wider and better manner, the objects of\r\nvolunteer corps and of yeomanry, which, as interrupting productive\r\noccupations now becoming more absorbing, is highly expensive, rendering\r\nall volunteer forces dependent in fitful zeal, and eventually\r\ncomparatively inefficient; that the juvenile drill, if made general,\r\nwill accomplish better the objects even of the militia; that the\r\njuvenile drill will abate diffidence in military efficiency, and will\r\nspread a wide predisposition to a better order of recruitment for the\r\npublic service, will tend to the improvement of the ranks of the regular\r\nforces, whether naval or military, and will produce an immensely\r\nstronger and cheaper defensive force than by the means at present in use\r\nor in public view.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, that the means of producing this defensive force, instead\r\nof being an expense, will be a gain to the productive powers and value\r\nof the labors of the country.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant-General Shaw Kennedy, in a letter expressing his high\r\napproval of the plan, states, “that the inferences drawn can not be\r\ncontroverted.” He is of opinion that if the measure is carried out it\r\nwill be the means of bringing two million of men actually under arms in\r\nGreat Britain alone, that is, excluding Ireland. He conceives that the\r\neffects of military drill and exercises, and the use of fire-arms taught\r\nat schools, would never be forgotten; that a youth so trained would, at\r\nany future period, with a slight degree of practice, renew his knowledge\r\nof what he had been taught.\r\n\r\nNor has the training of a better class of seamen been neglected. This is\r\nof vital importance to the well-being of a commercial people, and it is\r\nwell for us to see what steps England is taking in the matter.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of giving instruction in the naval drill, old masts and\r\ntackle have been obtained for some of the training schools in England,\r\nand Mr. Taffnell has received expressions of satisfaction from naval men\r\nof the way in which some of the boys have by these means been tutored as\r\nseamen in pauper schools. In order to form sailors, it is necessary to\r\nhave masts and sails rigged in the playground, and a regular seaman must\r\nbe engaged to drill the boys.\r\n\r\nMr. Baker has observed that the naval drill as given at Greenwich, is\r\nhighly effective. “He states that he was on board the Ganges and the\r\nConway at a time when many boys came on board who had been taught the\r\nnaval drill at Greenwich naval schools; and that they proved to be as\r\nready and well trained as man-of-war’s men; they were clean and orderly,\r\nand as a class were first-rate seamen, becoming petty and warrant\r\nofficers in greater proportion than others.”\r\n\r\nOf its consequence upon the national health and industry, Professor Owen\r\nhas stated that even in the best-warmed and ventilated schools, five or\r\nsix hours’ enforced stillness of growing children is a violation of the\r\nprimary laws of physiology; whilst Miss Nightingale and others agree\r\nthat, under the present system, children are placed under conditions\r\nwhich impair good bodily health and generate epidemic disease. Mr.\r\nRahnson, a school commissioner at Amsterdam, states that the physical\r\nevils attendant upon the present amount of sedentary confinement in\r\nschools, required from young children, is beginning to attract attention\r\nin Holland, and that they have under trial a system of exercises for\r\nschools advocated by Dr. Schrieber, of Leipsic. ‘The chief question,’\r\nsays the latter gentleman, ‘is, How are our children to be brought up?\r\nIs it according to the laws of nature? The answer is, No; or we should\r\nnot see so many children who were rosy and healthy before going to\r\nschool, become pale and bloodless after school has begun;’ and he\r\nprescribes the limitation of the hours of school confinement.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Rawlinson, civil engineer, gives the following as his opinion\r\nof the advantages of school drill in connexion with manual labor:\r\n\r\n“In my opinion, based on experience and observation, I think school\r\ndrilling and training would prove of the utmost consequence to the boys\r\nin after life. I may give a few instances. In all engineering and\r\nbuilding, tradesmen are frequently required to use their strength in\r\nconcert, lifting, carrying and drawing; men, to use their joint strength\r\nnot only effectively but safely, must have confidence in each other. Two\r\ntrained men will lift and carry more easily and safely than four\r\nuntrained men. I have frequently seen trained men weed out unskilled men\r\nwhere heavy lifting has been required, because they dare not risk the\r\ndanger arising from unskilled strength, and few have performed with more\r\nsafety work which would have been lighter and easier if all had been\r\nequally skilled. Men frequently reject the assistance of unskilled men,\r\nas there is absolutely danger in having them near. Frequent accidents\r\narise from using men unskilled in lifting, in hoisting, and at capstan\r\nwork. * * * Boys should not only learn to march, but to lift, carry and\r\npull in concert. There are many necessary feats of strength in all\r\ntrades, which are more matters of knack and tact than of brute strength.\r\nBrute strength frequently fails to do that which comparative weakness\r\ncan accomplish easily with skill and confident concert. There is no\r\nregular system of training in concert to use human strength in the best\r\nmanner in any trade, so far as I know; acting in concert is a matter of\r\nnecessity, and practice gives facility and confidence. Drill and\r\ntraining would probably double the effective human power of any\r\nestablishment, especially if numbers are instructed in joint feats of\r\nstrength. That which is taught to youth is never forgotten in after\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\n“As regards its fitness as an appendage to the highest branches of\r\neducation, we have the testimony of experienced examiners at the\r\nUniversity of Oxford, England, who state that six hours mental work,\r\ninstead of ten or twelve, for adults, was the time of the great majority\r\nof the prizemen; and it was always found that those who were the\r\nforemost in mental labor were commonly the foremost in boat-rowing and\r\nphysical exercise. The Vice-Chancellor of Oxford testifies that the\r\ninstitution of the systematized exercise of the volunteer drill in that\r\ncollege had been attended by an improvement of the mental labors, and of\r\nthe whole of the order and discipline, as well as of the health of the\r\nUniversity; and that, encouraged by these results, he was considering of\r\nmaking provision for cavalry exercises.”\r\n\r\nMr. Chadwick has also furnished incontestable proofs of the absolute\r\nnecessity of more active physical training for females and of its\r\nbearing upon the future welfare of the race. But this subject has been\r\nrendered so familiar to American readers by the able pen of Miss\r\nCatherine E. Beecher, that we need not touch upon the European view,\r\nexcept to say that the noble labors of Professors Ling and Branting, of\r\nSweden, have been ably seconded by very many of the governments of\r\nNorthern Europe, where a method of gymnastics for females, has been\r\nsystematized and practically adopted. From this brief sketch of the\r\npractical working of physical military exercises in Europe, let us turn\r\nto what has been accomplished among our own countrymen, whose activity\r\nin behalf of public education called forth the compliment from Prof.\r\nLeRoy, which we wish was better deserved, especially by the class which\r\nhe specifies. that “the improvement of schools is, so to speak, the\r\nfixed idea, the constant preoccupation of the statesmen of America.”\r\n\r\nWe have indeed a noble and liberal system of education, but we would see\r\nits fostering care so extended as to invigorate the bodies as well as\r\ndevelop the mental faculties and intellectual powers of the pupils. The\r\nmilitary exercises would best accomplish this, and at the same time form\r\nour public schools into a NURSERY FOR A BRAVE AND EFFECTIVE MILITIA.\r\n\r\nEarly in October last a communication was addressed by the writer to the\r\ndifferent governors, and various other persons connected with the\r\nexecutive departments of the Northern States, in regard to the\r\nadvantages to be derived from the introduction of infantry drills in the\r\npublic schools, and by early preparation in school-days to strengthen\r\nthe _militia_ of the different States. At the same time it was placed\r\nbefore the New York and other City Boards of Education, and referred by\r\nthem to special committees. The subject was also agitated through the\r\ncolumns of the daily press. The warm responses which have been accorded\r\nto these communications, prove the deep interest which is felt in this\r\nimportant matter, and it is to be hoped by the time this article appears\r\nin print,[25] some legislative action will have been taken.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: Written December, 1861. Recommended by Governors\r\n    Andrew and Morgan in their messages in January.]\r\n\r\nIn New York, the energetic Judge Advocate General, William H. Anthon,\r\nbeing engaged in a report upon the militia laws, and taking a warm\r\ninterest in all matters relative to the efficacy of the militia, thus\r\nspeaks of the importance of some alteration in the present system, in a\r\nletter addressed to Mr. Curtis, President of the Board of Education in\r\nthe city of New York:\r\n\r\n“The entire system, in my judgment, needs revision and reform, in order\r\nto make the militia what the Father of the Republic intended it should\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by several persons, and among others Col. Richard\r\nDelafield, U.S. A., and Maj. E. L. Molineux, that an excellent\r\nfoundation for an improved militia system would be the introduction of\r\n‘The Manual of Arms,’ and ‘The School of the Soldier and of the\r\nCompany,’ into our public schools.\r\n\r\nI am disposed to consider these suggestions as valuable, and shall feel\r\nobliged to you if you will, as early as may be convenient, inform me how\r\nfar you deem them practicable, and how they may be most conveniently\r\nintroduced into the institutions under the charge of your Board.”\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis, whose personal observations on the European school systems,\r\nand whose long experience at the head of the Educational Board of the\r\nlargest city in the Union, renders his views of the greatest value,\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“It has been my opinion for years that military instruction should,\r\nunder certain restrictions, and to a certain extent, be given to the\r\nolder boys in all the schools and institutions that are supported or\r\ndraw funds from the public treasury. It is but just to the State whose\r\nmunificence sustains these schools, that the pupils should be instructed\r\nin those branches of knowledge that will make them useful and effective\r\nin defending and protecting the State. A well organized militia,\r\nreceiving from year to year into its ranks the disciplined and\r\ninstructed youth who have passed through the public schools, and to whom\r\nthe duties of the soldier are familiar, will always be sustained by the\r\npublic confidence and esteem.”\r\n\r\nMilitary discipline and exercises are by no means an untried experiment\r\nin the annals of American education; some of our best private schools\r\nand institutes having long since adopted it, and with a good degree of\r\nsuccess as it will be our endeavor now to show.\r\n\r\nTo the admirable regulations of our National Military and Naval\r\nAcademies, we need not refer; the systematic course pursued by them for\r\nthe development of health, for discipline of mind and body, being well\r\nknown to the majority of our readers.\r\n\r\nOne instance which came under the writer’s personal observation, will\r\nsufficiently illustrate the dependence which can be placed upon\r\nwell-drilled boys in case of emergency.\r\n\r\nIn April last, when Washington was defenceless, Baltimore in riot, and\r\nall Maryland in a state of revolt, communication being cut off at\r\nAnnapolis, there was great fear of attack upon that important\r\nstrategetic point. The pupils were prepared for any exigency, and slept\r\nwith their loaded rifles over their cots. At an alarm of a night attack,\r\nthere was no hesitation among those gallant little fellows. They were up\r\ndirectly; fell in their ranks and off at a _double-quick_ for the point\r\nof danger, in an almost incredible short space of time. The elder boys\r\ndragged their howitzer with them. Had an attack taken place, those\r\npupils would have given a good account of themselves and have stood\r\ntheir ground with courage and steadiness. The secret of this is the\r\n_discipline_, for which they are indebted to the assiduity of their\r\nbrave and experienced superintendent, Captain Blake of the Navy.\r\n\r\nLet us read the opinion of this able officer in respect to the applying\r\nof this _discipline_ to public schools:\r\n\r\n“My experience at this institution long since impressed me with the\r\nimportance of this subject, and I intended to have given my views\r\npublicly, but you have left nothing more to be said upon it, and I can\r\nonly hope that those who have the control of our public schools will\r\nview the subject as we do. We have received about a hundred and forty\r\nacting midshipmen this year, some of them very young, and although they\r\nhave not been here two months, they present a beautiful example of such\r\nresults as the system would produce all over the country.”\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that the States now in rebellion have devoted\r\nmuch more attention to military instruction in special schools, than we\r\nhave, many of them pursuing the European plan of State Academies devoted\r\nto military science. Thus while we have been obliged to _create_\r\nofficers from the small nucleus afforded us from West Point, they have\r\nhad the students from State Colleges to officer their regiments.\r\n\r\nFor a long time back Virginia has annually expended upon her Military\r\nInstitute nearly $50,000; South Carolina, $30,000; Kentucky and other\r\nStates have likewise institutions, founded in whole or part, upon a\r\nmilitary basis.\r\n\r\nAlthough several attempts have been made to obtain legislative action\r\nfor similar institutes in the Northern States, they have not, up to the\r\npresent time, been successful, owing, we think, to the groundless\r\nopinion that it would prove a heavy tax, without a corresponding\r\nadvantage. We shall endeavor to prove in this article how economically\r\nan academy could be supported. It is, therefore, to private enterprise,\r\nwe are indebted for any experiments which have been made in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nSeveral of our best boys’ boarding-schools in this portion of the\r\ncountry, have for a long time employed a military instructor for the\r\npupils and been managed on a semi-military organization; they have been\r\nwell sustained by the patronage of the public. We instance two or three\r\nschools of the present time.\r\n\r\nDr. Russell’s Collegiate and Commercial Institute of New Haven, is one\r\nwhich has already been of national advantage to us, for according to\r\nProf. Daniel C. Gilman, “the scholars were of great service in drilling\r\nthe recruits of Connecticut at the outset of the war, and many of them\r\nnow hold important posts in the army. The scholars formerly trained as\r\ninfantry and are now at artillery practices.” Mr. Gilman very justly\r\nobserves, that in a country like ours with no standing army, every\r\nable-bodied man should learn to bear arms, and there can be no cheaper\r\nor efficient way of doing this than by teaching boys in schools.\r\n\r\nThe Eagleswood Collegiate and Military School, near Perth Amboy, N.J.,\r\nhas been recently organized on the military plan. The scholars are\r\nformed into a battalion under a superintendent and colonel commanding,\r\nthe rest of the officers being taken from the scholars. The State of\r\nNew Jersey has supplied the institute with arms, and the military\r\nregulations apply to the conduct of the pupils in their general\r\ndeportment. The reasons given for employing this discipline are the same\r\nthat apply in every instance, that it is the most orderly and effective,\r\nincreases the energy, vigor and manly attitude of the boys, and induces\r\ncheerful obedience.\r\n\r\nTo Major J. P. Prall, Military Instructor, we are under obligations for\r\nthe following account of Mr. Tracy’s _Military Boarding School, at\r\nTarrytown, N.Y._:\r\n\r\n“There is no question, in my mind, of the utility of military\r\ninstruction in schools, and if I had any doubts, they would speedily be\r\nremoved by the fact that the very exigency you propose to provide for is\r\nbeing developed, only in a less degree, in the volunteer army now\r\nfighting our country’s battles. There are a number holding honorable\r\npositions in the army of the Potomac, and elsewhere, who have more\r\nparticularly come under my own observation, that have passed through a\r\ncourse of similar instruction to what you propose, in private military\r\nboarding schools, who give evidence of superior knowledge as soldiers,\r\nand with a little preparation were _ready_ to assume the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of the field and camp. They have more particularly\r\ndistinguished themselves as drill masters and thorough disciplinarians,\r\nthe very ground you proposed to cover in your articles in the N.Y.\r\nTribune of Nov. 20. I have especially noticed, of late, the facility\r\nwith which youth acquire military knowledge since the outbreak of the\r\nrebellion, when the occasion seems to impress them more strongly with\r\nits importance.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the military availability of youth thus instructed, the\r\npromptness and precision that the system induces is apparent. A simple\r\nsketch of the routine of duties in a school over the military department\r\nof which I have the supervision, may give an idea of its utility, as\r\nwell as its usefulness. This department is conducted in such a way as to\r\nmake the military feature an auxiliary to the classical and preparatory.\r\nPart of two days in each week is more especially devoted to military\r\ndrill and instruction, when the flag is raised on the flag-staff on the\r\nparade ground with the roll of the drum, and the sunrise gun is fired.\r\nAt sunset it is lowered with the same ceremony by a file of boys, in\r\ncharge of an officer, or non-commissioned officer. On other days of the\r\nweek a drill of about an hour is held, in command of the company\r\nofficers,--always in presence of the Principal. The utmost strictness is\r\nrequired in all the military features. The “Assembly,” when beaten for\r\ndrill or parade, occupies one minute--_immediately_ after, “_fall in_”\r\nis given by the orderly, when _entire_ silence is required. Boys being\r\nnaturally playful, much more care in these particulars is necessary than\r\nin grown persons. _Tattoo_ begins at 9 o’clock precisely, when the\r\nminute of its duration expires every cadet is required to be in line for\r\n“roll call,” and the three squads, each in charge of an officer, are\r\nmarched by flank to their quarters, (the whole not occupying more than\r\ntwo minutes.) They halt opposite their beds, and salute their officer as\r\nhe passes out;--in five minutes the lights are extinguished. Their\r\nclothing is uniformly arranged, and in such way that if called up at\r\nnight they can dress without lights and without loss of time. The\r\nofficer in command of each, being held responsible for the condition of\r\nhis squad. The military instructor inspects at unexpected times, and\r\ndirects the chiefs of squads to report the result to the officer of the\r\nday, through whom all reports to the Principal must be made at 9 o’clock\r\nA.M. each day. _Reveille_ at day break, and they march by squads to wash\r\nroom, where twenty minutes is allowed for necessary ablutions, blacking\r\nboots, &c., and then the march to the Assembly-room for “_roll call_.”\r\nInspection of boots twice a week, at unknown times.\r\n\r\nThe squads for the _mess-room_ march in order, filing each side of the\r\ntables, face inward, and “_sit down_” by command; _rise_, march out and\r\n_break ranks_, observing the same military precision. These various\r\nduties are performed with pleasure and pride by the cadets, and the same\r\npromptness and regularity is apparent in every movement.\r\n\r\nThe _armory_ and arms are in charge of a detail of four, and are\r\ninspected in turn on the roll, each week, and reports are made of\r\ndisabled pieces, and the general condition of the arms and armory, to\r\nthe officer of the day, and through him to the Principal. The various\r\nreports are embodied into one, by this officer, so that the Principal is\r\nnot burdened with the details unless he calls for them.\r\n\r\nOrders are issued from time to time, by the Military Instructor, and\r\nengrossed in a book, which is open for inspection of visitors,\r\nannouncing promotions, results of inspection, and noting cases of\r\nmilitary merit and demerit, &c. This has a tendency to stimulate to\r\nexertion, and to efforts to avoid unfavorable notice.\r\n\r\nMilitary classes 1st, 2d and 3d, graduated according to military merit\r\nare established, and promotions to them made after strict examinations.\r\nAll company officers are selected from the 1st class.\r\n\r\nA class of Honor, consisting of members of the First class who have\r\nescaped being reported for disobedience and improper conduct, is also\r\nformed. A given number of military demerits reduces a cadet, and the\r\nbadge which is worn on the left breast is taken from him. He may,\r\nhowever, be reinstated.\r\n\r\nMilitary demerits are punished by military penalties.\r\n\r\nCadets are taught to observe the position of the soldier when off duty\r\nalso; the benefit of this is very marked. When the machinery is properly\r\nset in motion, the labor generally attending the minutiæ of school\r\nduties is greatly reduced, and much more pleasantly and thoroughly\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nI have not entered into all the details, (and have given the military\r\nonly) but enough to give a general idea of the plan adopted by this\r\nschool. There are different modes in use in other schools. Some\r\npartaking more of the military, and some less. I think there is danger,\r\noften, of _too much_ military being engrafted so as to make it\r\nburdensome; great care should be taken in this particular, as the cadet\r\nwearies of it when the novelty is past.”\r\n\r\nMr. N. W. Taylor Root, in his admirable book on School Amusements,\r\nfurnishes practical testimony “that it fosters habits of promptness,\r\nexactness, and unanimity of action; teaches implicit obedience to\r\ncommands, erectness of carriage, a neat and clean appearance, and a\r\ngentlemanly and respectful behavior.”\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that a system of military drill has been tested\r\nmorally and physically, in private schools, and found of decided\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nWhy should these benefits be denied to the pupils of Public Day Schools?\r\n\r\nWhy should this vast defensive power be lost to the Government?\r\n\r\nAs a national military necessity; as a protection to the health and\r\nconstitutional vigor of American youth; and as a powerful agent upon\r\ntheir moral behavior, their energy, self-reliance and spirit of\r\nenterprise, let PHYSICAL TRAINING BE ENGRAFTED ON THE COURSE OF STUDIES\r\nFOR ALL THE PUPILS EDUCATED AT THE EXPENSE OF THE STATE. Let us not\r\nhesitate at the magnitude of the undertaking, for it is a _necessity_,\r\nand under proper regulations and restrictions can be successfully and\r\neconomically accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty to be surmounted is the successful working of a\r\nsystem at once applicable to the requirements of a small district\r\nschool, with a limited number of scholars, attending only at certain\r\nseasons of the year, and of those of the larger cities, with numerous\r\nschools, in which a great number are under instruction.\r\n\r\nLet us commence at the foundation, in the Primary Schools.\r\n\r\nThe moment the child enters the school care should be taken that the\r\nmental exercises which are given should be relieved by frequent\r\nintermissions for running and playing, under the supervision of the\r\nteacher. This we are glad to say is the case in very many of our best\r\nprimary schools; but it is when the child becomes more advanced, when\r\nthere are lessons to commit to memory at home, that some simple physical\r\n_exercises_ should be taught him every day; exercises calculated to\r\ndevelop the growth and expand the muscles. The calisthenics recommended\r\nin Miss Beecher’s work are excellent, simple, and easily fitted to the\r\nlimits of the school house. The report of Mr. W. H. Wells,\r\nSuperintendent of Public Schools for Chicago, for 1860, gives some\r\ninteresting particulars of simple exercises which have been attempted in\r\nthat city.\r\n\r\nThere would be but little difficulty experienced in selecting movements\r\nand gymnastics suitable for the strength and ability of the classes of\r\nyounger boys, and girls under instruction, provided the method was\r\nestablished as an imperative duty which _must_ be regularly put in\r\npractice, and that no lack of interest on the part of teachers, or\r\nlaziness of the pupils would be accepted as an excuse for non-compliance\r\nwith the regulation. We trust if Physical Training is carried out in our\r\nsystem of education, that a carefully prepared Manual of all kinds of\r\nexercises, embracing the military drill, will be compiled for the use of\r\nschools; in a word, a text-book to which our teachers can turn with\r\nconfidence to find exercises suitable for all classes of pupils.[26]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 26: Such a Manual will soon be published by J. B.\r\n    Lippincott & Co., Philadelphia.]\r\n\r\nFrom the Girls and Primary, we pass to the Boys Grammar departments, for\r\nwhich we propose military exercises, as being the most economical and\r\nadvantageous for public schools; for _tactics_ manœuvre large bodies in\r\na small space, in an orderly manner, whereas gymnasiums are too\r\nexpensive, and can not be made large enough to accommodate many scholars\r\nat once. This opens to us our most difficult, but at the same time most\r\nuseful, field for prompt and energetic action.\r\n\r\nSuppose we take for an example one of our large cities. The lower and\r\nfemale departments having simple physical exercises in use, it is wished\r\nto introduce military exercises into the grammar schools. Let us see how\r\nsimply it can be organized, and how far it is possible to extend these\r\nstudies if desired.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting letter from the Mayor of Bangor, will show the\r\nmovement in that city, an example well worthy of being imitated.\r\n\r\n  CITY OF BANGOR,                  }\r\n  Mayor’s Office, Dec. 21st, 1861. }\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--In reply to yours of the 19th inst., I would say that, upon\r\nmy recommendation, through a communication I made to our City Council,\r\non the first Monday of the present month, an Order was passed directing\r\nthe military drill to be introduced into a portion of the Public Schools\r\nof this city.\r\n\r\nI had given the subject some thought and investigation, and was prepared\r\nto recommend the adoption of the drill for the physical training, no\r\nless than for the military instruction it might impart. The prevalent\r\nidea that education consists in training the intellect only, is\r\ngradually becoming superseded by the more rational theory that true\r\neducation consists in training the moral and physical, no less than the\r\nintellectual faculties.\r\n\r\nFor the physical training of boys, I think the military drill has much\r\nto recommend it besides the military instruction it imparts. It will\r\ntend to give them a better command of their muscles, and impart a manly\r\ngait and bearing. It will also, if properly conducted, teach them\r\nself-control, and give them true ideas of order, discipline, and\r\nsubordination, and whilst it will relieve them from the monotony of\r\ntheir ordinary studies will, by a grateful change, enable them to return\r\nto them with renewed interest.\r\n\r\nWe are entering upon the new experiment with caution, and have commenced\r\nby devoting an hour, twice a week, to the drill. We began in the school\r\nrooms, but found, after a few lessons, that the space these afforded was\r\ntoo small, and for the present shall use the large Gymnasium Hall. In\r\nsummer, the grounds in connection with our school houses may be found\r\nwell adapted for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe boys, with scarcely an exception, manifest much interest in their\r\ndrills, and receive the instruction much more readily than men. Two or\r\nthree of our public spirited citizens, well qualified for instructors,\r\nhave generously consented to devote the necessary time for drilling the\r\nboys, for the present winter, without compensation.\r\n\r\nSome of our teachers are also disposed to qualify themselves for drill\r\nmasters, and we are thus enabled to try the experiment without much\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nI have had no communication with Gov. Washburn in relation to this\r\nsubject, and was quite unaware of your interest in the matter. I however\r\nnoticed the article in regard to it in the Evening Post of Nov. 8th, and\r\nwas gratified with the important facts which it contained. I shall be\r\nglad to receive any further communication you may make to the public on\r\nthis important subject, and should you wish, will be pleased to\r\ncommunicate to you the further progress of our experiments.\r\n\r\n  Yours respectfully,\r\n  ISAIAH STETSON, Mayor\r\n  EDWARD L. MOLINEUX, Esq., New York.\r\n\r\nTo establish thoroughly and economically this military culture, the\r\nBoard of Education should appoint some competent person as Chief of the\r\nStaff to organize and carry out a system of instruction and drill; he to\r\nhave under him two or three assistant instructors of experience, under\r\nwhose guidance _a teacher, or teachers from each school_, should be\r\nfully instructed in the tactics, so as to be able to superintend the\r\ndrill of the boys, which should always take place during school hours,\r\nand thereby form a recreation from mental study, and not encroach upon\r\ntheir play time. These are the only persons connected with the\r\ndepartment beyond the scholars themselves, as it should be managed on\r\nthe principle of obtaining _the whole working force_ of the military\r\norganization from among the pupils.\r\n\r\nThe grammar department of each school should be formed into a company,\r\nor where the size of the school rendered it necessary, two companies:\r\nthe officers to be selected from the most deserving and competent boys.\r\n\r\nThe officers thus selected to be instructed theoretically and\r\npractically by extra drills, in their respective duties. This would not\r\noccupy much time, and any boy objecting to devote this time would not be\r\nworthy of holding his position, and should be replaced by some one more\r\ndeserving. Every school should possess within its limits space for a\r\nparade ground and for a few simple fixtures for gymnastic exercises. In\r\nstormy weather the exercises could be carried on indoors; for the drill\r\npossesses the advantage of affording exercise to a great number in a\r\n_small_ space without disturbance and noise.\r\n\r\nNo uniform would be required, and the only expense would be the loan or\r\npurchase of 500 or 1000 short muskets, which could be used in turn at\r\nthe different schools for drill or parade. A simple musket can be\r\nmanufactured very cheaply, which will answer for all purposes.\r\n\r\nThe care and cleaning of the arms, the escorting and carrying them from\r\nschool to school, or point to point, as required, should be the military\r\nduty of the pupils; thus expense will be saved, and the duty of prudent\r\nsoldiers to take care of their equipments and do their own work\r\ninculcated.\r\n\r\nThese different school drills, always in charge of the teachers, should\r\nbe visited in turn by the instructors, who would exercise a close and\r\ncareful supervision over them.\r\n\r\nEvery ten companies or schools should be formed into a regiment,\r\nofficered by those selected as the most capable, and who had passed the\r\nnecessary examination.\r\n\r\nOccasionally on Saturdays the regiments, in rotation, should be\r\nexercised by the instructors, in battalion movements, field manœuvres,\r\nskirmish drills, camp duties, &c. These Saturday exercises should not be\r\ncompulsory, but would be eagerly looked for by the boys as an amusement.\r\n\r\nIn the proper seasons they could be marched to the suburbs for their\r\nexercises, and thus a pleasant holiday, with healthy amusements, be\r\ngiven them under proper guidance. Any father will appreciate the\r\nadvantages of such exercises and enjoyment to his boys.\r\n\r\nIn the summer season it should be found out which of the boys could not\r\nswim, and had no parents able to teach them. All such should be classed\r\ntogether, and means taken to instruct them in this most requisite art.\r\n\r\nIf found desirable to teach them to move together in _large masses_,\r\n(in which our militia are certainly deficient,) it can be accomplished\r\nby organizing two, three, or more regiments, into a brigade, to be\r\ncommanded by the chief instructor, he selecting for his _staff_ the most\r\nintelligent of the scholars who could relieve him of much of the labor\r\nwhich the systematic working of this large military department would\r\nrender necessary. Thus those assigned to the staff would be learning the\r\ntechnicalities of the department and the duties of aids, secretaries,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThese staff officers, and any other of the pupils who showed a decided\r\ntalent, should be assisted in acquiring knowledge in the military\r\nscience by means of lectures, &c., from the chief instructor. An orderly\r\nsystem once organized, with the incentive to improvement by promotion\r\nfor correct deportment, and of military disgrace for ungentlemanly and\r\nunsoldierly conduct, would soon render this military instruction of\r\ngreat assistance to _teachers in the schools_. Let the boys understand\r\nthat disobedience or improper behavior debarred them from military\r\nhonors and the whole tone of their conduct would be improved.\r\n\r\nOf the exigencies of this war, if complicated by foreign interference,\r\nit is impossible to foresee, but every one is aware of the importance of\r\nearly training upon the destinies of nations, and but few will deny the\r\nvalue of a well-trained battalion of selected elder boys, in case of\r\nINVASION or trouble, by their relieving the fatigue of regular troops in\r\nmounting guard at the least exposed positions, at the camps, on baggage,\r\nor for convoys; likewise to act as drill-masters for the recruits.\r\n\r\nThe above plan, which was submitted to several Boards of Education last\r\nfall, was offered as being the best adapted for _immediate use_, and is\r\ntherefore provided for the instruction of the _teachers_. If, however,\r\nthe _Normal Schools and Colleges_ would provide systematically for this\r\ninstruction, it would be far better as they are the proper fields for\r\n_permanent benefit_, as each graduate would there become fully prepared\r\nto instruct in these exercises in the public schools.\r\n\r\nThe views of the Hon. Joseph White, of Massachusetts, respecting\r\nmilitary studies in colleges, are well worth noting. He says, “let the\r\ndrill be regular and compulsory, taking the place of the very irregular\r\nand insufficient physical exercises now taken, and our colleges would be\r\nvastly improved in their educational power, and the commonwealth would\r\nin a short time have a numerous body of educated men well skilled in the\r\nmilitary science and art, who will become teachers in our lower grades\r\nof schools and in our military companies and associations, and be\r\ncompetent when the alarm is sounded, to lead our citizen soldiers to the\r\nfield.” New Jersey has just offered a noble example by making an\r\nappropriation for military instruction in her State Normal School.\r\n\r\nBut we must look at the practical working of physical and military\r\ntraining in small district schools. Of necessity they are far behind, in\r\nintellectual culture, those in the cities, and owing to the small and\r\nuncertain attendance, physical and military drill would also have to be\r\nsimplified. The duties of a country life are such as not to render these\r\nexercises so necessary on the score of health, nor are the pupils\r\nwearied by such constant application to study. But how beneficial it\r\nwould be in smoothing the rough, clownish manners of the country pupil\r\nby teaching him the _position of a soldier_, and correct _walking_. In\r\nrespect to this, it should be the duty of the trustees to see that the\r\ndrill was taught as far as practicable to the boys (calisthenics to the\r\ngirls) by the teacher himself, who, if he were not already instructed\r\nfrom a Normal School, would find but little difficulty in mastering the\r\ndetails of tactics sufficiently for his purposes. With as small a number\r\nas twelve boys, company and skirmish drills could be taught; the latter\r\nis admirably suited for country schools, and would be a delight to the\r\nboys. If near the water they should be taught to swim.\r\n\r\nIt is thus we would teach our public school boys when they reach a\r\ncertain age, to act together as citizen soldiers and be prepared when\r\ncalled upon, to do yeomen service in the country; to make it their pride\r\nas well as their duty, to defend the Country and State which so\r\nliberally educates them, let us cultivate in them a lofty and noble\r\npatriotism, which shall have its effect upon future generations, for it\r\nis upon these qualities, their intelligence and enterprise, aided by\r\n_physical strength and health_, that the FUTURE of our country depends.\r\n\r\nAlthough a course of military training in the public schools would soon\r\nfurnish our State with an intelligent class of soldiers and line\r\nofficers, yet the _art_ of war in many of its branches, such as\r\nartillery, engineering, &c., requires a scientific education, which can\r\nnot be given in a private institution. Our colleges undoubtedly could,\r\nto a certain degree, supply this want. New York city possesses in its\r\nFree Academy a college which needs but the addition of two or three\r\nprofessorships to carry out in part this requirement, yet a _State\r\nMilitary and Scientific_ College seems a necessity to which early\r\nattention should be given, but to prevent its becoming a tax upon the\r\nState, it should be managed somewhat upon the plan of the Polytechnic of\r\nFrance, namely, that pupils at large may be admitted upon passing an\r\nexamination and paying the annual fee.\r\n\r\nOffer inducements in the way of superior education and careful training,\r\nand sufficient income would be received from the _paying_ scholars to\r\ncover the expense to the State. Thus, from this college, might annually\r\ngraduate men educated for the most scientific and skillful pursuits of\r\nlife, and who, in time of war, would richly repay the State for the care\r\ndevoted to their culture.\r\n\r\nAs an incentive to the public-school boys, several of the most deserving\r\nshould annually be sent to this college by the State, and to the\r\nNational Military and Naval Academies.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another important matter to be considered in physical\r\nexercises for public education, more particularly in sea ports, viz.,\r\n_Naval Training_.\r\n\r\nA late report of the Shipmaster’s Association has shown us that the\r\nreputation of our American vessels is deteriorating so rapidly, that\r\nunless something is done, quickly and effectually, to provide a remedy,\r\nforeign vessels will supersede ours in freighting. The necessities of\r\nour navy are too well known to need notice here, and surely these evils\r\nwhich assail the country at this trying moment of peril, should arrest\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIn large seaboard cities the naval training school, which has worked so\r\nadvantageously in England and Belgium, could be established very\r\neconomically by the fitting up of some hall, at a slight expense, with\r\nspars, sails, &c. Here of an _evening_, lectures and classes for\r\ninstruction in navigation and seamanship could be formed. This would be\r\nthe means of improving our sailors and of forming useful citizens from\r\nthose who now idle away their time around the streets and docks. The\r\nexpense would be but light, and the advantages obvious to our merchant\r\nmarine and navy. This would soon improve our class of sailors and\r\nofficers, reduce the rate of insurance upon American vessels, and\r\nrelieve us from the stain which is being cast upon us as a commercial\r\nand naval power.\r\n\r\nThe evening schools of New York city cost $73,000 per annum; a small per\r\ncentage of this sum would place in successful operation an _evening\r\nnautical_ school, which would enable, in less than three months,\r\nAmerican sailor boys to acquire sufficient knowledge of navigation to\r\naspire to the quarter deck. The handling of heavy guns and the\r\nprinciples of naval gunnery could also be taught. If a war with Great\r\nBritain breaks out, are we to be found slumbering in this respect, and\r\nmust we wait for the _first gun_ before taking active measures!\r\n\r\nWe are a peace-loving and domestic people, and we have indulged in the\r\ndelusive fancy that peace was to shine over us forever, until rudely\r\nawakened from our dreams by a formidable attack at the very foundation\r\nof our nationality. Every family circle is represented in that mighty\r\narmy which is battling for the Union, and we know that much of the\r\nsuffering caused to our brothers by this new and unexpected calling, is\r\ndue to the defects of their physical education, and to the want of a\r\nsufficient number of well trained officers. But the war is upon us and\r\nwe must meet it as may best become a free nation and be better prepared\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nIt is the proud boast of England that in time of war she is “Ready, aye\r\nReady,” but a much prouder and nobler cry for us would be, the prompt\r\n“Here” at the roll-call of our militia when summoned, like the minute\r\nmen of the Revolution, to the defense of the country. We want no large\r\nstanding army. In times of peace let our merchants, artisans, farmers,\r\nand mechanics, enrich and develop the resources of the country. It needs\r\ntheir industry and will amply repay their toil. But let them be trained\r\nand educated from school-days to their military duties, and at the first\r\nnote of war let that response of “Here” come cheerfully from our rich\r\nprairie lands, from our counting-houses, from our machine shops, from\r\nthe decks of far off vessels and from our public schools,--one mighty\r\ncry of POWER and SELF-RELIANCE from a noble militia, possessing a\r\nthorough _knowledge of its duties_; intelligent and earnest in the\r\nright; patriotic and strong in its devotion to freedom.\r\n\r\nA few words to those who fear the tendency of these exercises to instil\r\na warlike and blood-thirsty spirit, and we will close. To them we say,\r\nwe would emulate the ancients only so far as we can obtain from them\r\nsome of their earlier and nobler traits of patriotism, courage,\r\nstrength, endurance, and health. Let us picture what effect this\r\ntraining would have upon individual character.\r\n\r\nLet us take the example of a young lad, entering the public school in\r\nthe primary department, with perhaps a sickly, indolent disposition, and\r\nsomewhat careless and slovenly in his appearance.\r\n\r\nWe know very well from the present system of studies, that his mind will\r\nbe well cared for, and therefore pass to the effect of the physical\r\ntraining upon him.\r\n\r\nThe first lesson then is to stand in an erect and commanding attitude,\r\nwith his chest well expanded, then his careless, slouching steps, with\r\nhanging head, are soon changed to the brisk, smart _walk_ of a young\r\ngentleman, Calisthenics and exercises proportionate to his strength, and\r\ntending to develop his limbs very soon improve his health and impart a\r\nyouthful vigor and energetic purpose to his motions, which are so much\r\nto be admired in young lads and give such rich promise of the future\r\nmanhood. He soon learns exact and unhesitating obedience, and is taught\r\nby precept and example, that no small advantage in appearance is to be\r\nderived from a clean face and well brushed clothes. Is it to be denied\r\nthat he thus learns habits of order, activity and cleanliness which will\r\nbe invaluable to him in after years?\r\n\r\nBut his greatest ambition, the goal of all his hopes,--the reward for\r\nwhich he studies diligently, is active and neat in his deportment,\r\ndocile and obedient to his teachers,--is to be promoted to the grammar\r\ndepartment or higher classes, where the boys have military exercises. He\r\nlooks with longing eyes at their neat, orderly ranks, as they form for\r\ndrill or parade; their brightly polished shoes, neatly brushed clothes\r\nand well kept arms. All this is something to look forward to, and when\r\nhe has accomplished it, has he not to strive by activity to win his\r\n_grade_ and by self-control and obedience prove himself deserving to\r\ncommand others? Manhood, when it arrives, finds him bright, active,\r\nself-reliant and ready to become a public spirited member of society.\r\n\r\nLet the necessity of military exercises be placed before the boy in a\r\npatriotic light and it will induce him not only to take greater care in\r\nthe execution, but likewise implant a still greater love of country from\r\nthe very knowledge that some day he may be of use to her,--of use to her\r\nin the pulpit, in the legislative forum, in the busy pursuits of\r\nindustry and the various walks of life. And if the necessity again calls\r\nfor action, or if the present war is of long duration and tests the\r\nstrength and perseverance of our national character, let us not shrink\r\nfrom the ordeal, but with a firm reliance upon an Almighty God and a\r\nrighteous cause, let us go forth in this good fight, we of this\r\ngeneration and our children, and faithfully discharge the duties of\r\nChristian soldiers in defense of truth, justice, and our country.\r\n\r\n\r\nU.S. MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL MARINE SCHOOLS.\r\n\r\nNAVY AND NAVAL AFFAIRS.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution of 1789, Congress is empowered “to regulate\r\ncommerce, to provide and maintain a navy, and make rules for the\r\ngovernment and regulation of the land and naval forces.” The initiatory\r\nsteps for establishing and regulating a navy were taken by the\r\nContinental Congress in November and December, 1775. The management of\r\nnaval affairs was first assigned to a Marine Committee of Congress,\r\nappointed Dec. 11, 1775, which in 1779 (June 9), was converted into\r\nCommissioners, and before the close of that year, into a Board of\r\nAdmiralty, which consisted of five members, two of whom were members of\r\nCongress, with a secretary, who was appointed by Congress. In 1781\r\n(Feb. 7), a Secretary of Marine was created to execute all the duties\r\nand powers of the Board of Admiralty. In the condition of the public\r\ntreasury, and “in the dilatory and parsimonious action of the several\r\nStates in forwarding funds for the construction of ships, docks, and\r\nnaval arsenals, and for the support of the naval service,” Congress\r\nvoted in August, 1783, “that it was not advisable to purchase ships for\r\nthe present.”\r\n\r\nThe necessities of a disordered commerce, and of a sufficient naval\r\nforce to protect the navigation of the country, and repel the first\r\napproach of a hostile army from abroad, were among the motives for\r\nestablishing a more efficient federal government. But until the danger\r\nof war with England became imminent, a large party in the country, in\r\nand out of Congress, opposed the necessary appropriations for putting\r\nthe Navy of the United States on a respectable footing.\r\n\r\nIn constituting the executive departments of the national government\r\nunder the Constitution, the administration of the navy and naval affairs\r\nwere committed to the War Department, where it remained till 1798, when\r\n(April 30) an Act was passed “to establish an executive department to be\r\ndenominated the Department of the Navy.”\r\n\r\nThe Act of March 27, 1794, by which the construction and manning of four\r\nships of 44 guns each, and two of 36 were ordered, was called for by the\r\ndepredations on our commerce, and particularly in the Mediterranean Sea.\r\nIn this Act the appointment of eight midshipmen, to rank with the\r\nwarrant and petty officers, was authorized, and the Navy Register bears\r\nthe names of only eight officers holding that rank prior to 1800. In\r\n1801 the naval force of the United States consisted of 13 ships, viz.: 4\r\nof 44 guns each (_United States_, _President_, _Constitution_, and\r\n_Philadelphia_); 4 of 36 guns each (_Chesapeake_, _Constellation_,\r\n_Congress_, and _New York_); 5 of 32 guns each (_Benton_, _Essex_,\r\n_Adams_, and _John Adams_); and by an Act of that year all others were\r\nordered to be sold, and the completion of any more in the yards, was\r\nsuspended. But the insults to our flag and destruction of our commerce\r\nby the Barbary powers, and the privateers of England and France, aroused\r\nsuch a feeling in the country that Congress ordered a squadron to be\r\nfitted out for the Mediterranean in 1803, which proved to be the school\r\nin which the seamanship of the Navy was trained, and the gallantry of\r\nits officers signally displayed. In the legislation of this period\r\noriginated the “gun-boat” policy as an auxiliary means of harbor\r\ndefense. In 1805 the first vessel of this class was added to the\r\nMediterranean squadron, and in 1806 the President announced that 50 more\r\ncould be relied on for the naval service. Gun-boats, properly\r\nconstructed and armed, are now part of the system of harbor defense in\r\nall countries.\r\n\r\nBy an Act of Congress approved April 21, 1806, the whole number of able\r\nseamen, ordinary seamen and boys, for the United States Navy was not to\r\nexceed 925. March 3, 1807, the President was authorized to employ 500\r\nadditionals, increasing the authorized number to 1,425. January 31,\r\n1809, the President was authorized to employ 3,600 able seamen, ordinary\r\nseamen and boys, in addition to the number of petty officers, seamen,\r\netc., previously authorized, which increased the number of enlisted men\r\nallowed to 5,125.\r\n\r\nIn 1810 an appropriation was made to test the value of torpedo or\r\nsubmarine explosives, as engines of war, and in 1842 to test the\r\nsubmarine battery ignited by a submerged electric wire, devised by\r\nSamuel Colt. The introduction, of these “engines of war” into the\r\ndefense of Southern harbors, in 1861-65, demonstrated their efficiency\r\nand inaugurated a new system of not only harbor defense, but of attack.\r\n\r\nMarch 30, 1812, the President was further authorized to increase the\r\nseamen, etc., and as far as necessary to equip the frigates\r\n_Chesapeake_, _Constellation_, and _Adams_, any law to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding. In this Act provision was made for the appointment of a\r\nschoolmaster to each ship having a complement of 12 midshipmen.\r\n\r\nMarch 3, 1813, he was authorized to have built six sloops-of-war, and to\r\nhave them manned and equipped, and to employ the number of seamen which\r\nwere necessary for such vessels as were authorized by law to be put in\r\ncommission.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, in the appropriation annually of $1,000,000 for eight years to\r\nthe gradual increase of the Navy by nine 74 gun-ships, and twelve 44\r\ngun-frigates, provision was made to procure the steam-engines and build\r\nand equip three steam-batteries for the defense of ports and\r\nharbors--the introduction of a new element into the naval service. In\r\n1839 the Secretary was authorized to construct three steam-vessels of\r\nwar, “according to the best advices that could be obtained.”\r\n\r\nIn 1837, after strenuous efforts to enlist Congress in some systematic\r\nplan for supplying the navy with well instructed and thoroughly\r\ndisciplined seamen, the Secretary was authorized to enlist under certain\r\nconditions, boys between the ages of 13 and 18, who should receive\r\nspecial opportunities for school and professional training.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, $100,000 was appropriated to build at Pittsburg an iron steamer\r\n(the _Alleghany_); and the appearance and exploits of the _Merrimac_ and\r\nthe _Monitor_, in the waters of the Chesapeake, in 1863, introduced a\r\nnew system of naval construction and armament, not only into our navy,\r\nbut in less than ten years revolutionized the ship-yards and ordnance\r\nfoundries of the world.\r\n\r\nBy Act of March 3, 1845, it was provided “that the whole number of petty\r\nofficers, seamen, ordinary seamen, landsmen and boys, in the naval\r\nservice, shall not exceed 7,500 at any one time during the fiscal year,”\r\nfor which appropriation was then made.\r\n\r\nBy Act of March 3, 1857, the Secretary of the Navy was authorized to\r\nenlist 8,500 men for the Navy, instead of 7,500. During the late civil\r\nwar the limitation of enlisted men was suspended; and in his annual\r\nreport, December, 1862, the Secretary states the number of persons\r\nemployed on board our naval vessels, including receiving ships and\r\nrecruits, as about 28,000; and in his report of December, 1865, he says\r\nthe number was increased to 51,500 at the close of the war, which in\r\n1867 had been reduced to 11,900.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 the Secretary of the Navy revived the system of naval\r\napprenticeship, which was inaugurated under the Act of March 2, 1837,\r\nbut suspended because the favorable results anticipated from a fair\r\ntrial were not realized at once, under various disadvantages of a new\r\nenterprise, and because Congress, in 1845, by limiting the whole number\r\nof persons employed in the naval service, compelled the Department to\r\ndischarge boys instead of men.\r\n\r\nBy Act of June 17, 1868, the number of persons enlisted into the Navy,\r\nincluding apprentices and boys, was limited to 8,500--a limitation\r\nactually below the maximum which existed prior to the war, and compelled\r\nthe department to reduce the number of naval apprentices, and finally to\r\nagain abandon that system.\r\n\r\nThe number of line officers is now (1871) limited by law to one admiral,\r\none vice-admiral, 10 rear admirals, 25 commodores, 50 captains, 90\r\ncommanders; total flag and commanding officers, 177. To these are added\r\n80 lieutenant commanders, 280 lieutenants, 200 masters and\r\nensigns--making the total line officers of all grades, excepting\r\nmidshipmen (309 including those at Annapolis), 737.\r\n\r\nThe medical staff consists of 180, viz.: 15 medical directors\r\n(captains); 15 inspectors (commanders); 50 surgeons (Lieut.-commanders),\r\nand 100 passed assistant and assistant surgeons.\r\n\r\nThe engineers’ department (total 250) includes 10 chief engineers\r\n(captains); 15 _do._ (commanders); 45 _do._ (lieut.-commanders); 100\r\nassistants (masters and ensigns). There are 126 paymasters, 13 ranking\r\nas captains; 13 as commanders; 50 as lieut.-commanders. The number of\r\nchaplains is limited to 24, and of professors to 12.\r\n\r\nAlthough, strangely enough, not under the administration of the Navy\r\nDepartment, the inauguration of the Coast Survey in 1807, and its\r\nthorough prosecution since 1844, when the employment of officers of the\r\narmy and navy in the work was authorized; the recognition of the Naval\r\nObservatory at Washington city, and authorizing the making astronomical\r\nand meteorological observations, in the Act of August 3, 1848; the\r\nassignment of a competent officer of the navy to the preparation of the\r\nNautical Almanac; the institution of the bureau of Hydrography and\r\nOrdnance, in 1842; the employment of three suitable vessels of the navy\r\nto test and perfect the plans of Lieutenant Maury in his investigations\r\nof the winds and the currents of the ocean, by Act of March 3, 1849; the\r\nconcentration of the teaching staff of the corps of midshipmen\r\npreparatory for their examination at the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia,\r\nand their removal to separate accommodations at the old military station\r\nof Fort Severn, in Annapolis, by order of Secretary Bancroft in 1845,\r\nand the formal recognition of the institution as the Naval School, in\r\nthe appropriations for the navy in 1847--these and other acts of\r\nCongress, and the action of the Department under them, are important\r\ndata in the history of the Navy and Naval Education--especially of their\r\nscientific character.\r\n\r\nGROWTH IN SHIPS, OFFICERS AND MEN.\r\n\r\nThe following Tables, prepared by Capt.

HISTORICAL NOTICE.\r\n\r\nThe history of the United States Naval Academy, as an institution, opens\r\nOctober, 1845, but its germ and growth in suggestions, for the practical\r\ninstruction of midshipmen, dates back to the beginning of the century.\r\nA school of the Navy constituted one of the departments, or group of\r\nschools, in the plan of a Military Academy drawn up by Alexander\r\nHamilton, as Inspector General of the Army, and submitted to Congress,\r\nJanuary, 1800, in the Report of the Secretary of War (James McHenry),\r\nwhose department was at that time charged with the management of naval\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nIn 1808, General Williams, in a report on the enlargement of the\r\nMilitary Academy at West Point, of which he was Superintendent,\r\nrecommended “that nautical astronomy, geography, and navigation should\r\nbe taught by the professor of mathematics,” and that the plan of the\r\ninstitution should “take in the minor offices of the navy; but also any\r\nyouths from any of the States who might wish for such an education,\r\nwhether designated for the army or navy, or neither, and to let these be\r\nassessed to the value of their education.” This plan was doubtless\r\nsuggested by the Polytechnic School of France, and if adopted at the\r\ntime, would have not only have given to the army and navy a much broader\r\nand firmer basis of scientific attainments, but would have hastened the\r\nconstruction of roads, bridges, canals, and railroads, and the\r\ndevelopment of the mineral and other industrial resources of the\r\ncountry, by turning out every year a number of young men, qualified in\r\nscientific culture, to enter on the duties of civil, mining and\r\nmechanical engineers, and become superintendents of manufacturing and\r\nother corporate enterprises. In the absence of any special school of\r\npreparation for such civil services, officers of the army were induced\r\nto resign their commissions to superintend the construction of canals\r\nand railroads under state and corporate auspices.\r\n\r\nIn the measures which grew out of the war of 1812, was the act of\r\nJanuary, 1813, “to increase the Navy of the United States,” in which\r\nauthority was given to the Secretary of the Department to employ a\r\nschoolmaster for each vessel to which 12 midshipmen were assigned. By\r\nthese, so far as appears in any published document, was given the first\r\nformal employment of this class of officers.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 the Secretary (William Jones) suggested “the establishment of a\r\nNaval Academy with suitable professors, for the instruction of the\r\nofficers of the Navy in those branches of Mathematics and experimental\r\nphilosophy, and in the service and practice of gunnery, theory of naval\r\narchitecture, and art of mechanical drawing, which are necessary to the\r\naccomplishment of the naval officer.” This suggestion was renewed by his\r\nsuccessor, Smith Thompson, of New York, and a distinct proposition to\r\nlocate it on Governor’s Island, in the harbor of New York, by Secretary\r\nS. L. Southard, in 1824. In a special communication to the Senate in\r\n1825, he says:\r\n\r\n  The younger officers enter at so early an age, that they can not be\r\naccomplished, or even moderately accurate scholars. They are constantly\r\nemployed on ship-board, or in our navy-yards, where much achievement in\r\nlearning can not be expected. And yet the American naval officer is, in\r\nfact, the representative of his country in every port to which he goes,\r\nand by him is that country in greater or less degree estimated. “The\r\nscience and information requisite for a navy officer,” he repeats in his\r\nReport for 1827, “is in no respect inferior to that required by the army\r\nofficers and engineers, and the interest as well as the honor of the\r\ncountry are not less concerned in the correct performance of their\r\nduties.”\r\n\r\nPresident Adams (J. Q.) in his Annual Message, Dec. 5, 1825, remarks\r\nthat “the want of a Naval School of instruction corresponding with the\r\nMilitary Academy at West Point, for the promotion of scientific and\r\naccomplished officers, is felt with daily increasing aggravation.” In\r\nhis message, Dec. 4, 1827, he returns to the subject “as still\r\nsoliciting the sanction of the legislature,” adding--\r\n\r\n  Practical seamanship, and the art of navigation, may be acquired upon\r\nthe cruises of the squadrons, which, from time to time, are dispatched\r\nto distant seas; but a competent knowledge, even of the art of\r\nship-building, the higher mathematics and astronomy; the literature\r\nwhich can place our officers on a level of polished education with the\r\nofficers of other maritime nations; the knowledge of the laws, municipal\r\nand national, which in their intercourse with foreign states and their\r\ngovernments, are continually called into operation; and above all, that\r\nacquaintance with the principles of honor and justice, with the higher\r\nobligations of morals, and of general laws, human and divine, which\r\nconstitute the great distinction between the warrior patriot and the\r\nlicensed robber and pirate; these can be systematically taught and\r\neminently acquired only in a permanent school, stationed upon the shore,\r\nand provided with the teachers, the instruments, and the books, adapted\r\nto the communication of these principles to the youthful and inquiring\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, Secretary Upshur renewed the recommendation of his\r\npredecessors, and a bill to establish a naval school at or near Fortress\r\nMonroe, passed the Senate, but was not acted upon in the House.\r\n\r\nThe nucleus of a school was formed when the midshipmen were first\r\nordered to the Naval Asylums at Philadelphia and other places, to\r\nprepare for their examination, and several of the professors of\r\nMathematics repaired there to give instruction.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 the Secretary of the Navy (George Bancroft), inaugurated and\r\ncompleted in four months an arrangement by which a Naval School, with\r\nits corps of professors, was instituted in a suitable location, without\r\nany special appropriation, and with only the existing authority of acts\r\nof Congress. The original plan is best set forth in Mr. Bancroft’s\r\nletter to Commodore Franklin Buchanan, whom he appointed superintendent\r\nof the institution.\r\n\r\n  NAVY DEPARTMENT, August 7th, 1845.\r\n\r\n  SIR:\r\n\r\n  The Secretary of War, with the assent of the President, is prepared to\r\ntransfer Fort Severn to the Navy Department, for the purpose of\r\nestablishing there a school for midshipmen.\r\n\r\n  In carrying this design into effect, it is my desire to avoid all\r\nunnecessary expense--to create no places of easy service--no commands\r\nthat are not strictly necessary--to incur no charge that may demand new\r\nannual appropriations; but, by a more wise application of moneys already\r\nappropriated, and officers already authorized, to provide for the better\r\neducation of the young officers of the navy. It is my design not to\r\ncreate new officers, but, by economy of administration, to give vigor of\r\naction to those which at present are available; not to invoke new\r\nlegislation, but to execute more effectually existing laws. Placed by\r\ntheir profession in connection with the world, visiting in their career\r\nof service every climate and every leading people, the officers of the\r\nAmerican navy, if they gain but opportunity for scientific instruction,\r\nmay make themselves as distinguished for culture as they have been for\r\ngallant conduct.\r\n\r\n  To this end it is proposed to collect the midshipmen who from time to\r\ntime are on shore, and give them occupation during their stay on land in\r\nthe study of mathematics, nautical astronomy, theory of morals,\r\ninternational law, gunnery, use of steam, the Spanish and the French\r\nlanguages, and other branches essential, in the present day, to the\r\naccomplishment of a naval officer.\r\n\r\n  The effect of such an employment of the midshipmen, can not but be\r\nfavorable to them and to the service. At present they are left, when\r\nwaiting orders on shore, masters of their own motions, without steady\r\noccupation, young, and exulting in the relief from the restraint of\r\ndiscipline on shipboard.\r\n\r\n  In collecting them at Annapolis for purposes of instruction, you will\r\nbegin with the principle that a warrant in the navy, far from being an\r\nexcuse for licentious freedom, is to be held a pledge for subordination,\r\nindustry and regularity,--for sobriety, and assiduous attention to duty.\r\nFar from consenting that the tone of the discipline and morality, should\r\nbe less than at the universities or colleges of our country, the\r\nPresident expects such supervision and management as shall make of them\r\nan exemplary body, of which the country may be proud.\r\n\r\n  To this end you have all the powers for discipline conferred by the\r\nlaws of the United States, and the certainty that the department will\r\nrecommend no one for promotion, who is proved unworthy of it from\r\nidleness or ill-conduct or continuing ignorance, and who can not bear\r\nthe test of a rigid examination.\r\n\r\n  For the purpose of instruction, the department can select from among\r\ntwenty-two professors and three teachers of languages. This force, which\r\nis now almost wasted by the manner in which it is applied, may be\r\nconcentrated in such a manner as to produce the most satisfactory\r\nresults. Besides, the list of chaplains is so great that they can not\r\nall be employed at sea, and the range of selection of teachers may be\r\nenlarged by taking from their number some who would prefer giving\r\ninstruction at the school to serving afloat. The object of the\r\ndepartment being to make the simplest and most effective arrangement for\r\na school; you will be the highest officer in the establishment, and will\r\nbe intrusted with its government. It is my wish, if it be possible, to\r\nsend no other naval officer to the school, except such as may be able\r\nand willing to give instruction. Among the officers junior to yourself,\r\nthere are many whose acquisitions and tastes may lead them to desire\r\nsuch situation. For this end the department would cheerfully detach\r\nthree or four of the lieutenants and passed midshipmen, who, while they\r\nwould give instruction, would be ready to aid you in affairs of\r\ndiscipline and government. Thus the means for a good naval school are\r\nabundant, though they have not yet been collected together and applied.\r\n\r\n  One great difficulty remains to be considered. At our colleges and at\r\nWest Point, young men are trained in a series of consecutive years; the\r\nlaws of the United States do not sanction a preliminary school for the\r\nnavy; they only provide for the instruction of officers who already are\r\nin the navy. The pupils of the naval school being, therefore, officers\r\nin the public service, will be liable at all times to be called from\r\ntheir studies and sent on public duty. Midshipmen, too, on their return\r\nfrom the sea, at whatever season of the year, will be sent to the\r\nschool. Under these circumstances, you will be obliged to arrange your\r\nclasses in such a manner as will leave opportunity for those who arrive,\r\nto be attached to classes suited to the stage of their progress in their\r\nstudies. It will be difficult to arrange a system of studies which will\r\nmeet this emergency; but with the fixed resolve which you will bring to\r\nthe work, and with perseverance, you will succeed.\r\n\r\n  Having thus expressed to you some general views, I leave you, with\r\nsuch assistance as you may require, to prepare and lay before this\r\ndepartment for its approbation a plan for the organization of the naval\r\nschool at Fort Severn, Annapolis.\r\n\r\n  The posts to which you and those associated with you will be called\r\nare intended to be posts of labor; but they will also be posts of the\r\nhighest usefulness and consideration. To yourself, to whose diligence\r\nand care the organization of the school is intrusted, will belong, in a\r\ngood degree, the responsibility of a wise arrangement. Do not be\r\ndiscouraged by the many inconveniences and difficulties which you will\r\ncertainly encounter, and rely implicitly on this department as disposed\r\nto second and sustain you, under the law, in every effort to improve the\r\ncharacter of the younger branch of the service.\r\n\r\n  I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n  GEORGE BANCROFT.\r\n\r\n  Com’r FRANKLIN BUCHANAN,\r\n\r\n  United States Navy, Washington.\r\n\r\nUnder these instructions the school was duly organized at Fort Severn,\r\nAnnapolis, and formally opened, October 10, 1846, with 36 midshipmen,\r\nappointed in 1840, and who were, before resorting to Annapolis,\r\npreparing for examination at the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia; 13 of the\r\ndate of 1841, who were to remain at their studies until drafted for sea,\r\nand 7 acting midshipmen, appointed in 1845. The first staff of\r\ninstruction consisted, besides Commander Buchanan, of Lieutenant James\r\nH. Ward, in gunnery and steam; Surgeon J. L. Lockwood, in chemistry;\r\nChaplain George Jones, in English studies; Prof. Henry H. Lockwood, in\r\nnatural philosophy; and Prof. Girault, in French.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, Congress appropriated an amount not exceeding $28,000 for\r\nrepairs, improvements, and instruction at Fort Severn, Annapolis, Md.;\r\nand a like amount in 1847 for the same objects, “including a purchase of\r\nland not exceeding 12 acres, for the use of the Naval School.” In the\r\nsame year (Dec. 1847), Secretary Mason recommended a practice ship.\r\n\r\nDown to 1849, the regulations provided for two years’ study at the\r\nSchool, followed by three years’ service at sea, and then two years’\r\nstudy at the School. This alternation of study and practice--of practice\r\nat sea associated with opportunities of study, and of study at school\r\nwith many advantages of testing principles by experiments and the\r\nobservations of professors and officers of experience, possessed\r\nadvantages which still commend it to the minds of many officers over\r\nthat of longer continuous study at school before practice in earnest is\r\nbegun. The old system had its shortcomings, but it turned out good\r\nseamen and gallant officers, and its best features ought to be again\r\nengrafted on the new.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, a board of officers was directed by the Secretary of the Navy\r\nto consider the organization of the school at Annapolis, and report to\r\nthe department. This was done, and new regulations were matured, and\r\nordered to go into effect on the first of July, 1850. The teachers’\r\nstaff was enlarged, and a practice ship, the Preble, a sloop-of-war of\r\nthe third class, was attached for the purpose of a summer cruise, and\r\nthe institution was henceforth styled in Acts of Congress and Reports of\r\nthe Secretary, the Naval Academy. The course of instruction was arranged\r\nfor four years, with an interval of two or three months in the summer\r\ndevoted to a practice cruise for two of the classes. The President was\r\nauthorized to appoint a Board of Visitors, whose functions were “to\r\nwitness the examinations of the several classes, and examine into the\r\npolice, discipline, and general management of the Academy.”\r\n\r\nThe new system began in October, 1850, under Commander C. K. Stribling,\r\nas Superintendent, who was relieved in 1853 by Commander L. M.\r\nGoldsborough, who was in turn relieved by Captain George S. Blake, in\r\n1857, who continued in the superintendence till 1867, when Admiral\r\nPorter was assigned to the position, which he held till 1870, when\r\nCommodore J. L. Worden succeeded him.\r\n\r\nThe first or lowest class in the four years’ course, entered in October,\r\n1851, and graduated in June, 1854, having had two summer cruises of\r\npractice, and a long period of continuous study.\r\n\r\nThe necessities of the War, which as early as April, 1861, had made\r\nAnnapolis the seat of military operations, caused the removal of the\r\nAcademy--its professors, students, library and apparatus--in the month\r\nof May, to Newport, first to Fort Adams, and afterwards to the Atlantic\r\nHouse in the town, and to the _Constitution_ and other ships, which were\r\nnot fit for active service, in the inner harbor. All the members of the\r\nthree highest classes were ordered into active service, and with the\r\nfourth class, and 200 newly appointed, the system of instruction went on\r\nas in times of peace.\r\n\r\n_Course of Studies in 1864._\r\n\r\nIn the organization of the Naval School at Annapolis, in 1845, the\r\nordering of the course of studies was left practically with Prof.\r\nWilliam Chauvenet, a graduate of Yale College, who had been commissioned\r\nprofessor of mathematics in 1841, and had acted as such in the\r\ninstruction of midshipmen in the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia. The\r\nfollowing is substantially the arrangement proposed by him for the\r\nclasses when fully organized--the main deviation in the course as\r\nfollowed in 1864 was in the assignment of text-books.\r\n\r\nFIRST CLASS--FOURTH YEAR.\r\n\r\n_Department of Practical Seamanship, Naval Gunnery and Naval\r\nTactics._--Seamanship, Naval Tactics.

THEIR OWN PROCEEDINGS.\r\n\r\nThe regular session of the Board, although several members were in\r\nattendance earlier, commenced on Monday, the 20th of May, and continued\r\nfrom day to day until Friday, June 10th. Their investigations as a\r\nBoard, embraced--\r\n\r\n_First._--A thorough inspection of the buildings, ships, and material\r\nequipment provided by the Department for the residence, subsistence,\r\nhealth, and instruction of the several classes.\r\n\r\n_Second._--An attendance of the whole or a portion of the Visitors, for\r\na brief period at least, on the examination conducted by the Academic\r\nBoard, of one or more sections of each class in each study professedly\r\nattended to during the year.\r\n\r\n_Third._--An exhibition of the professional knowledge and skill\r\nattained, including the parade, evolutions, tactics, and drill as a\r\nmilitary corps--the uses of the rapier, cutlass, musket, and cannon,\r\ngreat and small--the handling of ropes, sails, spars, boats, and\r\neverything included in practical seamanship in harbor, afloat, and in\r\naction.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._--Inquiries into the mode of conducting the entrance\r\nexamination, and the results--the classification and programme of\r\nstudies for each class--Scholarship and conduct rolls--causes of failure\r\nto graduate, and system of punishment--chapel exercises, morality,\r\nmanners, and personal habits of the midshipmen--the accounts and\r\nvouchers for the expenditure of government appropriations, including\r\npayments made for the use of the cadets--in fine, into the police,\r\ndiscipline, and general management of the institution.\r\n\r\nA committee of the Board was authorized and requested to attend the\r\nentrance examination of the new class, as well as the final examination\r\nof the graduating class, in order that the report required of the\r\nVisitors might cover the operations of the Academy for the year 1864.\r\n\r\nEvery facility for prosecuting their investigations was extended to the\r\nVisitors by the Superintendent, Officers, Professors, and Students.\r\n\r\nII. CONDITION OF THE NAVAL ACADEMY IN 1864.\r\n\r\nIn presenting some details of the condition of the Naval Academy as they\r\nfound it, and in offering suggestions for its improvement, which the\r\nsubmitting of a report implies, the Visitors are not unmindful that the\r\ninstitution is not at present furnished with permanent buildings and\r\nequipments in all respects adapted to its purpose;--that even such as\r\nare furnished were selected with reference to a smaller than the present\r\nnumber of pupils;--that its staff of instructors and course of\r\ninstruction have been disturbed by the pressing exigencies of a great\r\nwar, calling off into actual service some of its most experienced\r\nteachers;--that the education which it aims to give is not general but\r\nspecial, not covering the whole ground of a generous culture, but\r\nparticularly adapted to make accomplished seamen and midshipmen;--and,\r\nmoreover, that in an educational field so wide and subjects of inquiry\r\nso numerous as attach themselves to the details of such a school, a\r\nbrief visit, made while the institution is not following its usual daily\r\nroutine, is not in all respects the most favorable to the formation of\r\njust and reliable opinions. They at the same time believe that the\r\ngovernment and people expect that the liberal appropriations in its\r\nfavor will be expended with a judicious economy, and that the knowledge\r\nimparted will be accurate, thorough, and professional, and that its\r\ngraduates will be really fitted for that rank of the service for which\r\nthey are professedly trained. They recognize the fact that the school is\r\nyet in the youth of its development, and also that its purpose is not\r\nonly to perpetuate naval science as it has been taught, but to maintain\r\na progressive course of instruction, engrafting thereon all necessary or\r\npossible improvements.\r\n\r\n_Organization for Administration and Instruction._\r\n\r\nThe Visitors find the Naval Academy, subordinate to the direct\r\nsupervision of the Department, under the immediate government of a\r\nSuperintendent, Commodore George S. Blake, who is held responsible for\r\nits discipline and management. He is assisted as chief executive officer\r\nby the Commandant of Midshipmen, Commander Donald M. Fairfax, who\r\nresides in the Academy building on shore, and is also head of the\r\ndepartment of Seamanship, Naval Gunnery, and Naval and Infantry Tactics.\r\nThe Commandant is assisted in the different departments of his duty on\r\nship and shore by three senior assistants and eleven assistants, nine of\r\nthe latter being of the rank of lieutenant, and the remainder\r\nlieutenant-commanders. Two of the senior assistants have charge of the\r\nPractice-ships Marion and Macedonian, and also assist in instruction;\r\nsix of the assistants are engaged in executive duty on board the\r\nSchool-ships Constitution and Santee, while the others, as well as\r\nthese, are charged with certain branches of instruction in the\r\ndepartment of which the Commandant is chief.\r\n\r\nThere are also attached to the Academic Staff one Professor of\r\nAstronomy, Navigation, and Surveying; two Professors of Mathematics,\r\nwith six assistants in the same department; one Professor of Natural and\r\nExperimental Philosophy, with two assistants; one Professor of Ethics\r\nand English Studies, with nine assistants; one Professor of the French\r\nlanguage, with an assistant; one Professor of the Spanish language; one\r\nProfessor of Drawing and Draughting, with an assistant; one\r\nSword-master, with an assistant; and one Librarian, who acts also as\r\nassistant in Mathematics, and Ethics and English studies. The officers\r\nnot attached to the Academic Staff include a Paymaster, a Surgeon, with\r\ntwo assistants, a Chaplain, (with three, who are engaged as\r\ninstructors,) a Commissary, Storekeeper, Secretary, Treasurer, and\r\nclerks to the Superintendent and Commandant.\r\n\r\nThe Academic Board is composed of the Superintendent, the officers in\r\ncharge of the Practice and School-ships, and the professors, except that\r\nthe professors of French, Spanish, and Drawing take part only upon\r\nmatters pertaining to their own departments. The Board is required to\r\nconduct and regulate all examinations of candidates and students,\r\npreparing the necessary papers and reports in connection therewith, to\r\nprescribe the order and times of instruction, to recommend text-books\r\nfor the approval of the Naval Department, and books, instruments, and\r\nother necessary material for instruction, to recommend at pleasure the\r\nrestoration or farther trial of students that have been dismissed or\r\nfound deficient in scholarship, to grant certificates of graduation, and\r\nto report from time to time, on the system of studies and instruction\r\npursued, and propose such improvements as experience may suggest.\r\n\r\n_Buildings and Material Equipment._\r\n\r\nThe material arrangements for the accommodation of the Academy, for the\r\nlodging, subsistence, and comfort of the pupils in health and sickness,\r\nand for study and instruction, both scientific and professional,\r\nalthough made on a sudden emergency, for temporary occupancy, and for a\r\nsmaller number, are far from being insufficient in extent, or\r\nparticularly objectionable, when compared with similar arrangements for\r\nother great schools. The main building on shore is of wood, originally\r\nintended to lodge and board a large number of guests, and as adapted to\r\nthe uses of the Academy, accommodates about half of the classes as well\r\nas most boarding schools provide for their pupils. The arrangements are\r\nnot as convenient or as safe from fire as those at Annapolis; but they\r\nare too good to be complained of, even if they do require a strict\r\nobservance of regulations, or special organization and diligence to\r\nprotect from fire, which would carry mourning into many homes. Good\r\ndiscipline and good recitations, and a large amount of military and\r\nnaval knowledge are secured under the difficulties such as they are,\r\nwhich the Department, be they great or small, will, doubtless, remove at\r\nthe earliest possible moment. In any permanent or temporary arrangement,\r\non ship or shore, while the privacy and comfort of separate lodgings for\r\npupils should as far as practicable be secured, the Visitors recommend\r\nthat convenient halls be provided, properly ventilated, warmed and\r\nlighted, and supplied with the best dictionaries, encyclopedias, and\r\nnaval histories and biographies--to be occupied for study at certain\r\nhours by such pupils as have not acquired the power of concentrating\r\nattention, and the habit of solitary study--a power and habit of the\r\nhighest importance, but very rarely attained. The same rooms might be\r\nopen to the pupils at certain hours every day for the purpose of reading\r\nnaval histories and biographies, and for consulting the encyclopedias\r\nand other books of reference. The formation of right habits of study and\r\nthe habit and mode of reading such books to the best advantage should be\r\nmade a matter of special and frequent inculcation by the head of each\r\ndepartment of study.\r\n\r\nThe lack of suitable buildings for lodging, subsistence, and study, for\r\na portion of the pupils, is supplied by an extension of the School-ship\r\nSystem, first inaugurated on board of the “Plymouth,” at Annapolis, in\r\n1849, in our system, although always the main feature in the French\r\nsystem of naval education. The old “Constitution” and the “Santee,”\r\nproperly moored in the harbor of Newport and adapted, are used for the\r\nresidence and study of the younger classes, which are in this way\r\nbrought more readily into the daily routine of the school and the\r\nservice without the vulgar annoyances, to which the youngest classes are\r\nalmost universally subjected, when lodged in the immediate neighborhood\r\nof the next older class. If School-ships are to constitute a permanent,\r\nintegral feature of the Academy, the details of arrangements for\r\nseparate lodging and class study require additional attention. For the\r\npresent, recitations are attended in suitable buildings on Goat Island,\r\nnear which the ships are moored and reached by covered passages. On this\r\nisland is sufficient room for all sorts of athletic sports, military\r\ndrill, and target practice.\r\n\r\nThe “Macedonian” and “Marion” are used for practice in the evolution of\r\nguns and other naval tactics by the several classes. To these are added,\r\nat least for the purposes of the summer cruise, the screw steamer\r\n“Marblehead” and the yacht “America.”\r\n\r\n_Number of Pupils--Entrance Examination._\r\n\r\nThe number of pupils belonging to the Naval Academy in the year closing\r\nJune, 1864, was 458, distributed into four classes, generally according\r\nto the period of their connection with the institution, with a staff of\r\n57 officers and instructors. This is an astonishing development of the\r\nAcademy in respect to pupils, as well as in the number of the teaching\r\nstaff, and equipment for professional training, since Oct. 10th, 1845,\r\nwhen the Academy found a location at Fort Severn in Annapolis, or since\r\nJanuary 1st, 1846, when it was reported to have 36 midshipmen and six\r\nprofessors and instructors, including the Superintendent. To judge of\r\nthe progressive development of the institution, and of the results of\r\nthe annual examination which they were appointed to witness, the\r\nVisitors deemed it necessary to ascertain the average condition of each\r\nclass as to age and attainments, at the time of becoming connected with\r\nthe Academy, and with the general results of the entrance\r\nexamination--this examination being the only check on the admission of\r\nunqualified candidates--no previous examination being held in the\r\ndistricts or States from which they come.\r\n\r\nBy law and regulations governing the admission of candidates into the\r\nAcademy, the maximum number of pupils is limited to 526, viz., two for\r\nevery Congressional district or territory, appointed on the nomination\r\nof the member or delegate, from actual residents of the district, if\r\nsuch nomination is made to fill a vacancy duly notified, prior to the\r\nfirst day of July in any year, and if not so made, by the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy; and twenty-five more appointed by the President, two for and\r\nfrom the District of Columbia, ten from the country at large, ten from\r\nthe sons of officers of the army and navy, and three from the enlisted\r\nboys of the navy. All candidates who receive notice of their provisional\r\nappointment must present themselves to the Superintendent for\r\nexamination between the 20th and 31st of July, or September in case of\r\nsecond appointments. The examination is twofold; first, before a medical\r\nboard, consisting of the surgeon resident and two other medical officers\r\ndesignated by the Department; and second, before the Academic Board. The\r\ncandidate must be found, according to the law of 1864, to be between the\r\nages of fourteen and eighteen years--of good moral character--physically\r\nsound, well formed, and of robust constitution--and pass a satisfactory\r\nexamination in reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic, geography and\r\nEnglish grammar.\r\n\r\nThe requisition as to age was advanced from 16 in 1861, to its present\r\nmaximum in 1864, while the Board was in session, and conforms in that\r\nrespect to the age which they had decided to recommend. The traveling\r\nexpenses of the successful candidates are paid.\r\n\r\nThe Visitors were furnished on application with tables exhibiting the\r\nstatistics of these entrance examinations from 1851 to 1863 inclusive.\r\nFrom these tables it appears that out of 1,522 candidates, nominated and\r\nappointed conditionally, but afterwards examined, 313 or one-fifth of\r\nthe whole were rejected as unqualified, although the attainments\r\nrequired were such as any graduate of a common school should possess. Of\r\nthe number (1,209) admitted, 466, more than one-third, failed on the\r\nfirst year’s course. Out of the number who failed at the earlier\r\nexaminations, three hundred and thirty-one were turned back for a second\r\ntrial, and after floundering along in the lower sections, only a very\r\nsmall per cent. succeeded in graduating. Of the whole number admitted,\r\n(1,209,) only 269 graduated, including 93 who were received into the\r\nservice from 1861 to 1864 before completing their studies.\r\n\r\nFrom another table, covering the entrance examinations from 1860 to 1864\r\ninclusive, it appears that out of 1,093 candidates who presented\r\nthemselves for admission, 807 were admitted, while 53 were rejected by\r\nthe Medical Board, 219 by the Academic Board, 11 withdrew, and 3 were\r\nfound to be over the maximum age.\r\n\r\nFrom another table, exhibiting the ages of the successful and\r\nunsuccessful candidates, it appears that out of 1,141 candidates\r\nexamined, 201 (18 per cent.) were rejected, and of the number rejected,\r\n177 were under 17 years of age. Of the 940 admitted, 313 (33 per cent.)\r\nfailed the first year, and of the number that failed, 254 were under 17\r\nyears of age. The average age of the candidates admitted was 16 years\r\nand 2 months, and of those who failed, 15 years and 10 months.\r\n\r\nThe fact that one-fifth of the whole number nominated failed to pass the\r\nexamination in the most rudimentary branches of a common English\r\neducation--and in only the most elementary portions of these\r\nbranches--indicates unmistakably how little regard has been paid to\r\nschool attendance and proficiency in the selection of candidates. To\r\njudge how far these failures might be attributed to a laudable\r\nstrictness on the part of the Academic Board, the entrance examination\r\npapers, which are filed away from year to year, were called for, and\r\nfrom those it appears that the questions asked and exercises required\r\nwere few and simple--far too few and simple--far below the requirements\r\nof any Public High School; and yet such wretched perversions of the\r\northography of the most common words, such mistakes in American\r\ngeography, such bungling use of the English language in the composition\r\nof a simple letter, such numerous failures in arithmetical operations\r\nnot going beyond the elementary rules and simple exercises in fractions\r\nand proportion, it would be difficult to gather from all the Public High\r\nSchool entrance examinations of the country. More strictness on the part\r\nof the Academic Board would have saved the government hundreds of\r\nthousands of dollars, for of the candidates allowed to pass, two-fifths\r\nfail on the studies of the first year, although these studies belong to\r\na good English education, and are preliminary to a special scientific\r\nnaval training--showing a want of suitable preparatory knowledge, of\r\naptitude for study, or of will and desire to learn. A portion of those\r\nwho fail the first year are put back for a second year’s trial, and in\r\nsome instances for a third, and the proportion of those thus put back\r\nwho finally succeed in graduating is very small, thereby causing a total\r\nloss of the thousands of dollars expended upon each. From data gathered\r\nfrom the annual reports of the Department, it appears the annual expense\r\nof a pupil of the Naval school exceeds $1,500, and that each graduate\r\nwho has been four years in the institution costs the government over\r\n$10,000. But the pecuniary loss is not the only consideration--the\r\nplaces filled by pupils, no matter what their courage or general\r\nability, unable or unwilling to profit by the opportunities of\r\nscientific and professional instruction so lavishly provided, might be\r\nfilled by competent, ambitious, diligent, and courageous young men, if\r\nthey could have had their qualifications tested by a competitive\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n_Daily Routine._\r\n\r\nThe morning gun calls the cadets up at 6 o’clock. Inspection of the\r\nrooms follows, when the bedding must be found arranged, the rooms swept,\r\nand every thing in order. Ten minutes are given to chapel services, and\r\nhalf an hour to breakfast, which is over at 7.15. Forty minutes\r\nrecreation are then allowed, during which sick-roll is called and such\r\nas report themselves indisposed are marched to the hospital and reported\r\nto the surgeon. At 7.55 the sections are formed under the supervision of\r\nthe Officer of the Day, assisted by the section leaders, and at 8\r\no’clock, on given signal, they are marched in close order to their\r\nrecitation rooms, in perfect silence and with strict military decorum.\r\nAll who are not engaged in the recitation rooms are expected to be\r\npreparing their lessons in their own rooms, and it is the duty of the\r\nsuperintendents of floors to see that they are there. The dismissal and\r\nre-formation of sections at the end of each hour are conducted with\r\nsimilar formality and regulated by special signals. Study and recitation\r\ncontinue until 1 o’clock, when the cadets are formed in order by the\r\ncaptains of crews, (the whole corps being organized in nine guns’ crews,\r\nfor the purposes of discipline and practical instruction,) all special\r\norders and rules for the day are read, and they are then marched into\r\nthe mess hall for dinner, which occupies forty minutes. From 1.40 to\r\n1.55 recreation is allowed and the sections are then again formed as in\r\nthe morning for recitation and study. At 4 o’clock ten minutes are given\r\nto preparation for drill, as may be the order of the day, and then\r\nfollow instruction in fencing, infantry or artillery drill, and\r\nrecreation until parade and roll-call at sunset. Supper immediately\r\nsucceeds, to which half an hour is given, and recreation until\r\nstudy-call at 6.30 or 7.00, according to the season. Study hours\r\ncontinue until tattoo, at 9.30, during which time the cadets must all be\r\nin their rooms, and after inspection of rooms all lights are\r\nextinguished at 10 o’clock.\r\n\r\nThe routine on board ship is as far as possible the same. No control is\r\nexercised over the occupation of the time by the cadets during study\r\nhours, provided good order is preserved. No studies or exercises are\r\nrequired on Saturday afternoon and one-half of each class may then be\r\nallowed liberty beyond the limits of the Academy. A vacation is given at\r\nthe close of the second year, the only one in the whole course. As means\r\nof recreation, chess, draughts, and all games of chance are strictly\r\nforbidden. On the other hand, every facility is afforded for games of\r\nball, boxing, fencing, boating, &c.\r\n\r\n_Course of Instruction, Examinations, and Merit-Rolls._\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction at the Naval Academy is comprised in eight\r\ndepartments, with their special branches, as follows:--\r\n\r\n_First Department_, in six branches--Practical Seamanship, Theory and\r\nPractice of Gunnery, Naval Tactics, Infantry Tactics, Howitzer Drill,\r\nand the Art of Defense.\r\n\r\n_Second Department_, Mathematics, in seven branches--Arithmetic and\r\nAlgebra, Geometry, plane and solid, Trigonometry, Mensuration,\r\nDescriptive Geometry, Analytical Geometry, and the Differential and\r\nIntegral Calculus.\r\n\r\n_Third Department_, in four branches--Astronomy, Practical Astronomy,\r\nNavigation, and Surveying.\r\n\r\n_Fourth Department_, in eight branches--Mechanics of Solids, Mechanics\r\nof Liquids, Pneumatics, Acoustics, Electricity, Heat, Chemistry, and the\r\nSteam-Engine.\r\n\r\n_Fifth Deportment_, in seven branches--English Grammar, Descriptive\r\nGeography, Physical Geography, Outlines of History, Rhetoric, Ethics,\r\nand Political Science.\r\n\r\n_Sixth Department_--the French Language.\r\n\r\n_Seventh Department_--the Spanish Language.\r\n\r\n_Eighth Department_--Drawing and Draughting.\r\n\r\nThese studies are distributed into four annual courses for the four\r\nregular classes, each class being subdivided into convenient sections,\r\nusually according to the relative standing of the members. During the\r\nlast year the first class, of 36 cadets, has been graded into three\r\nsections; the second class, of 59 cadets, into five sections; the third\r\nclass into six sections; and the fourth class, during the first term,\r\nwith 176 cadets, into fourteen sections, and in the second term, with\r\n156 cadets, into twelve sections--each section receiving separate\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nThe more difficult portions of the several branches may be reserved for\r\nthe higher sections of the classes, and it is frequently the fact that\r\nin certain branches no instruction whatever is given to the lowest\r\nsections. Deviation from the general rule for the admission of cadets\r\nonly in the month of September has made the formation of “Intermediate\r\nClasses” necessary, so that there are now two divisions of the second\r\nclass and two divisions of the third class. By this means the number of\r\nsections is increased, the labors of instruction augmented, and much\r\ninconvenience in other respects created. The demands of the times have\r\nalso introduced other irregularities into the course, hurrying the more\r\nforward sections through their studies and detailing them into active\r\nservice at the close of the third year, with or without a graduating\r\nexamination, while the lower sections are retained through the whole\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\nThe Commandant of Midshipmen and the several professors are each at the\r\nhead of a special department, with such assistants as may be necessary.\r\nThe professors, instructors, and assistants are responsible for the\r\nregular and orderly conduct of their respective classes and sections\r\nwhile under instruction, and must report all want of preparation,\r\nabsence, or misconduct. Daily notes are taken of the progress and\r\nrelative merit of each pupil in each of his studies. The assistants must\r\nmake weekly reports of such notes to the heads of their departments, who\r\nin turn report to the Superintendent, recommending such transfers as\r\nshould be made from one section to another. The scale of daily merit in\r\neach study embraces seven grades, with corresponding values designated\r\nby numbers, as follows:--Thorough, (4.0)--Very Good, (3.5)--Good,\r\n(3.0)--Tolerable, (2.5)--Indifferent, (2.0)--Bad, (1.0)--Complete\r\nFailure, (0.) The average standing for the week in each study\r\naccompanies the report. Monthly reports are drawn up by the Academic\r\nBoard for each month in the academic year, showing the relative standing\r\nof the members of each class in their different studies, and also their\r\nconduct or demerits. These reports are based upon the weekly reports and\r\nupon the results of the examinations, when such are held within the\r\nmonth, and are posted for public inspection. The examination weeks are\r\nconsidered of equal weight with those of the month.\r\n\r\nThe examinations are held by the Academic Board in the months of\r\nFebruary and June, and are sufficiently thorough to enable the Board to\r\ndecide upon the proficiency and relative merits of the members of the\r\nseveral classes. After each June examination a “general merit-roll” is\r\nformed for each class, for which purpose a maximum number or value is\r\nassigned to each of the principal branches in the several departments.\r\nThe total amount of these maxima throughout the course is 1,000, and\r\nthey are distributed among the departments and branches, for the\r\ndifferent classes, as follows:--In the first year, to mathematics,\r\n20--grammar and rhetoric, 10--geography, 10--history and composition,\r\n10--drawing, 10--conduct, 5--total, 65;--In the second year, to\r\nseamanship, 20--mathematics, 35--grammar and rhetoric, 15--history and\r\ncomposition, 10--French, 30--drawing, 25--conduct, 15--total, 150;--In\r\nthe third year, to seamanship, 40--gunnery, 20--infantry tactics,\r\n25--howitzer drill, 20--mathematics, 45--general astronomy,\r\n25--practical astronomy, navigation, and surveying, 15--mechanics,\r\n30--physics, 25--moral science and international law, 20--French,\r\n40--conduct, 30--total, 335;--In the fourth year, to seamanship,\r\n100--gunnery, 60--naval tactics, 30--practical astronomy, navigation,\r\nand surveying, 75--physics, 30--steam-engine, 35--moral science and\r\ninternational law, 20--Spanish, 50--conduct, 50--total, 450. The minima\r\nvalues are fixed at one-third of the corresponding maxima.\r\n\r\nThe “general merit-roll” includes only such as pass a satisfactory\r\nexamination in all the principal branches of their class and have not\r\nexceeding 200 demerits recorded against them. In the formation of the\r\nroll, the individual having the highest standing in any branch for the\r\nyear receives the corresponding maximum number, while the one who has\r\nthe lowest standing receives the corresponding minimum. The intermediate\r\nmembers of the class receive numbers proceeding by equal differences\r\nfrom the maximum to the minimum, in the order of their relative merit as\r\nfixed by their “class merit-rolls.” The gradation for conduct is\r\ndetermined by allowing the maximum number to such as have no demerits,\r\nand for others diminishing that maximum by 1/300 part for every demerit\r\nrecorded against them. All the numbers thus assigned to the several\r\nmembers for the different branches of study and for conduct are then\r\nadded together, and the members are arranged in each class according to\r\nthe aggregates thus obtained. For the graduating class a “graduating\r\nmerit-roll” is formed by adding the aggregate numbers of each member\r\nupon the several “general merit-rolls” for the four years and arranging\r\nthe order of the members according to these new aggregates. The highest\r\nnumber reached upon the “graduating merit-roll,” by any one of the class\r\njust graduating, was 859.\r\n\r\nIf any student at any examination fails to pass a satisfactory\r\nexamination in any principal branch, or has recorded against him more\r\nthan 200 demerits since the commencement of the academic year, a report\r\nis made of the case to the Secretary of the Navy, showing the habits of\r\nstudy, aptitude for study and for sea duties, and his general habits and\r\nconduct, and upon his decision the student is dismissed, or upon\r\nrecommendation of the Academic Board, allowed to continue at the Academy\r\nfor further trial.\r\n\r\nThe final graduating examination is held by a special Board and occurs,\r\nby a recent regulation, not less than one year after the close of the\r\ncourse. This examination embraces seamanship and naval tactics,\r\npractical gunnery, navigation, and management of steam-engines, and the\r\nstanding in these branches is combined to determine the relative merits\r\nof the candidates. In assigning numbers, 1,000 is considered the maximum\r\nand 333 the minimum for such as are considered qualified for promotion,\r\nand the Board assigns such numbers within these limits as will fairly\r\nexpress the relative qualifications of the members of the class. The\r\nnumbers thus assigned, when added to the numbers already assigned on the\r\n“graduating merit-roll,” determine the standing of the graduates as\r\nensigns; the highest number taking precedence.\r\n\r\n_Text-Books. Studies of the past Year._\r\n\r\nThe method of teaching as at present pursued is almost wholly by means\r\nof text-books and recitations. A series of lectures is delivered in\r\nconnection with the recitations in Natural Philosophy and Chemistry.\r\nWithout underrating the office of the text-book, the success of the\r\nFrench Polytechnic method of teaching even the higher Mathematics by\r\nlectures, collateral study, and examination, and the experience of all\r\nschools, of the power of the human voice and of the human eye to win,\r\nhold, and harmonize attention should not be lost to this institution,\r\nmany of whose pupils need the influence of such a method to vitalize\r\ntheir powers of thinking and to bring within their grasp the general\r\nprinciple or doctrine of the subjects taught.\r\n\r\nThe division of the classes into small sections of 12-14 midshipmen\r\neach, of nearly equal standing, tends to secure the personal and\r\nthorough instruction of each and all. The attempt was made, by\r\nfurnishing prepared blanks to the several departments, to ascertain the\r\ncharacter and actual amount of the studies and exercises accomplished by\r\nthe several sections during the eight months of study of the year\r\n1863-4. The returns made are not complete, but it appears that the\r\nEnglish studies of the lowest class (in 12-14 sections) have consisted\r\nof one lesson a week in Spelling and Derivation, four in Bullion’s\r\nEnglish Grammar, four during the first term in Cornell’s Geography, and\r\nduring the second term in General History, with daily exercises in\r\nComposition and the exercise of the Voice; in Mathematics, five lessons\r\na week during the first term in Greenleaf’s Common School Arithmetic,\r\nand during the second term in Davies’ University Algebra. In the upper\r\nsections, the Algebra was commenced within the first term and more or\r\nless nearly finished at the close of the year. The highest section had\r\nalso five lessons a week for three weeks in Davies’ Elementary Geometry\r\n(5 books) and instruction twice a week in Drawing. The space in the\r\nseveral textbooks actually gone over varied considerably in the\r\ndifferent sections. It will be seen, therefore, that the studies of this\r\nclass, with the exception of Algebra and Geometry, are simply those of\r\nevery common school, and yet the lower section is reported as having\r\nsucceeded but “imperfectly” in Grammar, and “very imperfectly” in\r\nAlgebra. It is also to be stated that a part of the class had received\r\neight weeks additional preparatory instruction during August and\r\nSeptember, 1863.\r\n\r\nIn the third class, of six sections, there were three lessons per week,\r\nduring the first term, in American History, and during the second term\r\nin Rhetoric. The lower section prepared six English compositions each\r\nterm--the highest section, weekly compositions through the second term.\r\nAll the sections prepared three lessons weekly in French during the\r\nfirst term and four lessons during the second, but with very unequal\r\nprogress. In Mathematics, (five lessons per week,) Algebra was completed\r\nby the lower sections and reviewed by the higher in the first four or\r\nfive weeks, when Elementary Geometry was taken up by all, and completed\r\nin the first term by the highest section. In the second term, Elementary\r\nGeometry for three weeks by the lowest section, and Trigonometry for the\r\nrest of the term--in the highest section, Trigonometry for ten weeks,\r\nMensuration two weeks, and Analytical Geometry commenced, for three\r\nweeks. The first section had also three lessons a week in Marine and\r\nTopographical Drawing, and during the first term one lesson a week in\r\nSeamanship.\r\n\r\nIn the second class, of five sections, during the first term, five\r\nlessons a week in Analytical Geometry, replaced in the highest section\r\nby the Differential and Integral Calculus for five weeks; four lessons a\r\nweek in Statics, to which the first section added Dynamics, three weeks;\r\nfive lessons a week in Surveying, three weeks in each term, with\r\npractical exercises. The lowest sections had also four lessons a week in\r\nFrench, and the first section weekly lessons in Seamanship and Infantry\r\nTactics, and two lessons a week in Gunnery. In the second term, five\r\nlessons a week in Dynamics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics and Acoustics, with\r\ntwelve lectures, Surveying, three weeks, and Astronomy, ten weeks. Two\r\nlessons a week in Wayland’s Moral Science. The first section had also\r\ntwo lessons a week in Gunnery.\r\n\r\nThe first class, consisting of the three more advanced sections of the\r\nsecond class, and in its third year of study, during the first term were\r\npursuing chiefly second class studies, having five lessons a week in\r\nPhysics, including Statics, Dynamics, Hydrostatics, Acoustics,\r\nMagnetism, and Electricity, with sixteen lectures; four lessons a week\r\nin Theory and Practice of Navigation (six weeks) and General Astronomy\r\n(eleven weeks;) two lessons a week in Seamanship, and two in Gunnery,\r\nNaval Light Artillery, and Field Fortifications. In the second term,\r\nfour lessons a week in Heat and Chemistry, with nine lectures; three in\r\nWayland’s Ethics and Kent’s Constitution of U.S., and International Law;\r\nthree in the Theory and Practice of Navigation; two in Seamanship; and\r\none in Gunnery, &c. Two lessons a week were given through the year in\r\nSpanish, by means of the French.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the daily lessons of each class are the general practical\r\nexercises by divisions, by the higher classes on shore embracing daily\r\nexercises in Fencing, three exercises weekly in Infantry Drill, Howitzer\r\nDrill once a week, the Great Gun Drill upon the Practice Ships twice\r\nweekly in favorable weather, and a certain amount of Target Practice by\r\nthe first class. The younger classes on the school-ships have also their\r\nspecial drills. Special instruction is given them in boating, and the\r\nnumerous cutters and launches belonging to the ships afford ample\r\nopportunity for recreation and practice of this kind at suitable times.\r\nThe use of the “Rainbow,” a schooner-rigged craft of 15-20 tons, is also\r\nnot unfrequently allowed to pleasure parties made up from the cadets.\r\nWeekly bathing is enjoined and practiced throughout the year as a\r\nsanitary regulation, but the absence of the cadets from port during the\r\nsummer months, while on the cruise, prevents the attainment of that\r\nknowledge and skill in the art of swimming, which seem to the Visitors\r\nso essential a requisite.\r\n\r\nThe general results of the examinations and exercises as observed by the\r\nVisitors, may be stated as in general very favorable. The examinations\r\nof the classes were made by sections and conducted by the individual\r\nprofessors of the departments, with great fairness and impartiality,\r\nwithout any purpose of embarrassing the pupils, and for the single\r\nobject of eliciting the extent, accuracy, and vividness of the pupil’s\r\nknowledge of the topic. Written lists of questions were furnished to the\r\ncadets on entering the examination rooms, which were usually answered in\r\nwriting upon the blackboard, with opportunity for oral explanation. The\r\ndifference in the proficiency shown by the higher and lower sections, in\r\nall except the first class, was very strongly marked. In the written\r\nanswers, the writing was fair and legible, and the spelling and\r\ncomposition very creditable--revealing in these respects an immense\r\nimprovement upon the entrance examination papers of the same cadets. The\r\nVisitors would suggest that in future examinations there should be more\r\nof paper, even if there should be less of blackboard work, and that a\r\nportion of the questions should be handed in on slips by the Visitors\r\nand answered in writing with ink, in presence of the Board, by every\r\nmember of the section present.\r\n\r\nThe practical professional exercises of the cadets upon the parade\r\nground and on board ship, embracing all the different branches of shore\r\nand ship duty, (including a harbor cruise on board the Practice\r\nSteamer,) and designed to exemplify the proficiency of the classes in\r\nseamanship, gunnery, and naval and infantry tactics, were performed in\r\nthe most satisfactory manner, justifying the professional pride\r\nmanifestly felt by those taking part in them. Moreover, these exercises,\r\ninstead of being executed under the direction, as heretofore, of the\r\nrespective Academic officers in command, were conducted under the charge\r\nwholly of officers appointed from the midshipmen themselves.\r\n\r\n_Physical Training._\r\n\r\nThe unavoidable exposures and risks of the naval service require not\r\nonly a sound mind--a mind well informed, quick, and accurate in its\r\noperations, but a sound body--a body supple, athletic, and tough to\r\nresist the rapid alternations and continuous exposures of wet and cold\r\nweather. Although careful and continuous training can do much to\r\ndevelope and strengthen the qualities referred to, the records of the\r\nAcademy and of the service, as well as the present appearance of many of\r\nthe cadets, show that sufficient regard has not been paid to vigor and\r\nelasticity of physical constitution, in the original appointment, or the\r\nentrance medical examination. The regular military drill and evolutions,\r\nthe small arm and other exercises, in which the whole corps\r\nparticipates, the professional practice in gunnery and seamanship, all\r\nhelp to supply these deficiencies. There is still room for more careful\r\nscrutiny for inherited tendencies and hidden defects, in the entrance\r\nmedical examination, as well as in the regular course of naval\r\neducation, for a well arranged system of gymnastic exercises and\r\nathletic games, to give suppleness to the joints, steadiness to the\r\nnerves, hardness to the bones, and elasticity to the sinews. Such games\r\nand sports as the young universally accept with eagerness and pursue\r\nwith unflagging interest, should be systematically introduced. Ample\r\ntime, room, and encouragement by rank, prizes, and publicity, should be\r\ngiven to make a fondness and indulgence in such games as cricket,\r\nfootball, leaping, boating, &c., the habit of every member of the lower\r\nclasses at least. An hour a day devoted to these healthful sports, even\r\nif taken from the study and class-room,--even more, if taken from the\r\nidle lounging, or the listless walk, or vulgar scuffling, will give at\r\nonce health and strength, increased capacity for study, and valuable\r\nsocial qualities and manly virtues--all results of emphatically the\r\nhighest professional value.\r\n\r\nAs part of the physical training of naval cadets, the expansion of the\r\nchest and the culture of the vocal organs should receive more special\r\nattention than the word of command on parade, and the questions and\r\nanswers in the examination would indicate they had received. A clear,\r\nfull, decisive voice is an element of influence on the deck at all\r\ntimes, and of power in the hour of danger, as well as on the field or in\r\nthe senate chamber.\r\n\r\nThe first beginning of habits, secret or open, which waste the vigor of\r\nthe mind and body, should be watched with professional skill as well as\r\nparental interest, and those cadets in whom such indulgencies have grown\r\ninto habits, should be cut off from the institution and service without\r\nhesitation and without reprieve.\r\n\r\n_Domestic and Sanitary Arrangements._\r\n\r\nThe institution is peculiarly fortunate in having had for years a\r\nCommissary who understands his business and gives universal satisfaction\r\nto all concerned. The neatness of the kitchen, the supply, preparation,\r\nand serving of the food, the geniality, good order, and enjoyment of the\r\nmess-hours, and the fact that no complaint reached the Visitors from any\r\none of the 450 boys, blessed with good health and plenty of physical\r\nexercise, makes the record of this department an exception to similar\r\ndepartments in other large collegiate institutions. This comes from\r\nhaving the right man in the right place.\r\n\r\nThe hospital arrangements on shipboard and on shore, although not as\r\nlarge and quiet as would be desirable or as would be provided specially\r\nin permanent quarters, are sufficient for the demands on their\r\naccommodations. The location of the institution and the judicious\r\narrangement and management of the Academy as to cleanliness, exercise,\r\nand diet, as well as the presence of a surgeon and two assistants on the\r\nAcademic staff, and numerous attendants for hospital service, would seem\r\nto act as a preventive of accidents and disease, the mean daily\r\npercentage of sick on ship and shore from Oct. 1st to May 31st being\r\nreturned at a little more than three per cent. out of an average\r\nattendance of 447 midshipmen. In calling for the annual reports to the\r\nDepartment of the medical condition of the institution, the Visitors\r\nwere informed that a duplicate copy or abstract was not retained. Such\r\ncopy or abstract would be highly convenient, and would seem to be even\r\nnecessary, if it is deemed advisable to have a periodical inspection of\r\nthe sanitary condition and requirements of the school.\r\n\r\n_Religious Observances and Instruction._\r\n\r\nThe regulations require that the students shall be assembled in the\r\nchapel for prayers daily, fifteen minutes before the breakfast hour, and\r\nthat divine service shall be held on Sunday, which officers and students\r\nare expected to attend, unless excused on the ground of conscientious\r\nscruples, declared in writing by the former, and by the parents or\r\nguardians of the latter. These daily and Sunday exercises are conducted\r\nby the regular Chaplain of the institution. He is at the present time\r\nassisted in these and other such voluntary religious labors by three\r\nother chaplains of the Navy, who are now in residence as assistant\r\nprofessors. There are four Bible classes composed of cadets, and over\r\none-eighth of the members are communicants in the different\r\ndenominations of Newport. The student who brings, in his moral culture\r\nfrom home, religious convictions and habits, can easily preserve and\r\nstrengthen them here, and no amount of instruction in the institution\r\ncan compensate for the neglect of parental example and teaching in this\r\nrespect. The absence of the religious element in the character and\r\ntraining of youth is a fundamental defect, and no institution of\r\nlearning, special or general, can safely, for any length of time,\r\ndispense with appropriate and adequate means of religious instruction\r\nand a practical recognition of religious obligations, consistent with\r\ndue regard to the religious convictions of individuals and the equal\r\nrights of all religious denominations. Such individual convictions and\r\ndenominational rights can be best respected, not by ignoring the\r\nsubjects themselves, but by selecting the chaplain from time to time so\r\nas to represent different religious denominations, and in all cases, in\r\nreference to his ability to be useful as chaplain in this institution.\r\n\r\nThe reading of the Sabbath, and one of the exercises of Monday morning\r\nmight be so arranged as to harmonize with the religious observances and\r\nuses of Sunday, and the whole be made to unfold and enforce the great,\r\ndefinite, and unchanging obligations of every human being to his\r\nfellow-men, to his country, and to God.\r\n\r\nAs part of the religious and moral instruction of the Academy, more at\r\nleast should be attempted to prevent, and if these unfortunately exist,\r\nto eradicate certain vulgar and vicious habits, whose beginnings are\r\nsmall, but which ultimately take complete possession of the individual.\r\nAlthough the Visitors can not, from their own knowledge, speak of its\r\nexistence, they have had too many assurances from those who did know, to\r\nhave any doubt of the prevalence of the vulgar and immoral practice of\r\nprofanity, and that several of those addicted to it are among the\r\nyoungest members of their classes, who came here entirely pure in this\r\nrespect. The medical and police experience of the institution detects\r\nthe occasional existence of other tastes and habits more directly\r\naffecting the health and morality of their victims, and which should and\r\ndoubtless do receive the considerate and vigilant attention of the\r\nauthorities, especially of the Chaplain, Surgeon and Superintendent.\r\n\r\n_Discipline._\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent is charged with and held responsible for the good\r\norder and discipline of the Academy, and it is made the duty of every\r\nofficer, professor, and instructor, having knowledge of any violation of\r\nlaw or regulation, or of any crime, irregularity, neglect, or other\r\nimproper conduct, of which any student or any other one has been guilty,\r\nto report the same without delay to the Superintendent. Offenses are\r\ndefined with great minuteness and precision, and the circle of\r\npunishments embraces demerits on the roll of conduct, private and public\r\nreprimand, confinement to Academy grounds, to room, or to guard-room,\r\nand withdrawal on necessity, or dismission. In the administration of\r\ndiscipline, the Superintendent is clothed with much power, which is\r\nexercised by the present incumbent with great discretion and the\r\nhappiest results. The private memorandum and letter book of this\r\nofficer, respecting every case of discipline during the year, was placed\r\nbefore the Visitors, and they can bear willing testimony to the\r\npreventive admonition and parental regard with which he has exercised\r\nhis authority.\r\n\r\nDemerits, to be considered in making up the conduct-rolls, are assigned\r\nfor all offenses. Such delinquencies as are not deemed deserving of\r\nseverer punishment are grouped into four classes, which count ten,\r\neight, six, four, and two demerits respectively, besides a miscellaneous\r\nclass counting from one to ten demerits according to circumstances. The\r\n_total_ demerits of each cadet is expressed by the sum of all demerits\r\nstanding against him on record for the year, increased for the third\r\nclass by one-sixth, for the second class by one third, and for the first\r\nclass by one-half.\r\n\r\nNo punishment of any kind can be inflicted by other authority than that\r\nof the Superintendent. Report is read at evening parade of all demerits\r\nand other punishments that have been inflicted during the day, and\r\nopportunity is always given for excuse or explanation. Full record is\r\nmade of every case of discipline, and a monthly conduct-roll is publicly\r\nposted showing the number of demerits against each cadet. It is evident\r\nthat this conduct-roll does not fairly represent the character and\r\nconduct of the cadets, as a large number of demerits may be gained by\r\nnumerous minor offenses, which involve neither immorality nor\r\nlawlessness, while a cadet who has been guilty of most flagrant acts of\r\nvice and disobedience may still be charged with but few demerits. Yet\r\nthe conduct-roll has but a subordinate influence in determining the\r\ngeneral merit-rolls, and in the question of dismissal the fuller record\r\nof punishments, as well as the demerit-roll, has its weight in\r\ndetermining the action of authorities.\r\n\r\n_Financial Affairs._\r\n\r\nAll money appropriated for the support of the Naval Academy is drawn for\r\nby the Paymaster and by him deposited with the Sub-Treasurer in Boston.\r\nThe Paymaster draws upon him, from time to time, to make his\r\ndisbursements.\r\n\r\nThe principal heads of expenditure for the fiscal year ending June 30th,\r\n1864, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Pay of Commissioned and Warrant Officers, Midshipmen,\r\n    Seamen, and others,                                  $241,771.71\r\n  Pay of Professors and Assistants,                        35,000.00\r\n  Expenses of the Academy, School and Practice Ships,\r\n    Surgeon’s necessaries, contingent expenses,\r\n    and repairs of all kinds,                              72,753.84\r\n\r\nThe total of all expenditures from 1st July, 1863, to May 31st, 1864; is\r\nreported at $383,419.41.\r\n\r\nFrom the pay of the midshipmen, which is $500 per annum, $100 are\r\nreserved yearly to be paid upon graduation, though this sum is sometimes\r\ndiminished by unavoidable circumstances. There is also deducted from\r\ntheir pay, the amount of board--at present $16.50 per month--and $3.00\r\nper month for washing. The aggregate of these sums is paid monthly by\r\nthe Paymaster to the Commissary. Articles of clothing for the midshipmen\r\nare provided under contract by the Storekeeper with the approval of the\r\nCommandant. All other articles for their use are purchased by the\r\nStorekeeper, from funds provided by the Paymaster, at prices sanctioned\r\nby the Commandant.\r\n\r\nThe midshipmen receive such articles as they desire upon requisition\r\napproved by the Commandant, and no other articles are permitted to be\r\nsold to them than those which the Storekeeper is authorized to have.\r\nEach midshipman has a pass-book in which his purchases are entered, and\r\nregular report is made by the Storekeeper to the Paymaster, who charges\r\nagainst each the aggregate amount of his purchases. On the 30th April,\r\n1864, the amount of balances still due to the midshipmen was $44,579.93,\r\nthe aggregate of indebtedness by them being only $111.90. The amounts to\r\nthe credit of the members of the graduating class vary from $180 to\r\n$400.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the Commissary are examined quarterly by a committee of\r\nthree officers appointed by the Superintendent, to whom they make\r\nreport. The Visitors deemed at their duty to go behind the reports of\r\nthis committee, and deputed one of their number to examine personally\r\nthe original accounts of the Commissary and Storekeeper. As the result\r\nof this examination, which was conducted with the most rigid scrutiny,\r\nit is but justice to state that they found the accounts correct in all\r\ntheir details, and the prices of all articles as low as they can be\r\npurchased at wholesale in the city of New York, and the Visitors\r\nconsider the financial affairs of the Academy as conducted with\r\ncommendable skill and fidelity.\r\n\r\nWhile the Visitors bear willing testimony to the fidelity with which the\r\nfinancial affairs of the Academy, as well as the departments of\r\nsubsistence, discipline, and instruction, are and have been\r\nadministered, they can not but express their disappointment at the very\r\nsmall number of officers of the lowest rank which the institution has\r\ncontributed to the naval service. With an aggregate annual expenditure\r\nof several hundred thousand dollars, the aggregate number of graduates,\r\nsince the opening of the four years’ course, in 1851, including the\r\nthree classes of 1858, ’59 and ’60, which were ordered into active\r\nservice in 1862 and ’63, before completing their studies, is but 269, or\r\nat the rate of less than 22 each year, at an expense to the country of\r\nover $12,000 for each graduate. If the 93 who entered the service with\r\nonly two or three years’ residence had completed their course, the\r\naggregate expense for each graduate would have exceeded $15,000. This,\r\nas it appears to the Visitors, small result, is due mainly to the want\r\nof care in selecting candidates, and the very low standard of general\r\nscholarship required for entering the Academy. The experience of this\r\ninstitution is the same as that of others of the same character; any\r\nmode of selection which does not test in advance the natural aptitude\r\nand preparation for the special studies of the course, and exclude\r\nrigorously all who are found deficient, will burden the institution with\r\na number of students which will have to be thrown off after months and\r\nsometimes years of struggling to incorporate them into the regular\r\nclasses and to the manifest injury, in the meantime, of the scholarship\r\nand character of the institution. While a nomination by patronage, and a\r\npass examination have a direct tendency to reduce the average ability of\r\nthe selected candidates to the minimum required, a competitive\r\nexamination raises the general average to the maximum ability of all who\r\napply.\r\n\r\n_Graduating Class of 1864._\r\n\r\nThe present graduating class (consisting after the final examination\r\nof 31) at the close of its third year has completed the whole course\r\nprescribed, excepting that the Calculus has been omitted and that\r\nSurveying has been limited to instruction in Harbor and Coast Surveying,\r\nfrom Bowditch. Steam and the Steam-engine have received fuller attention\r\nfrom this than any preceding class, embracing six weeks of theory and\r\npractice on board of the steamer Marblehead--altogether too little\r\nattention for a department so important. Two summer cruises have been\r\nmade by this class--both coast cruises--the first on board the John\r\nAdams, from June 6th to Sept. 30th, 1862; the second from 16th June to\r\n25th Sept., 1864, in which the following vessels were united, viz.:\r\nFlagship Macedonian, sloop of war Marion, screw steamer Marblehead, and\r\nthe yacht America. Upon these cruises the midshipmen were practiced in\r\nall the regular duties attaching to the posts of lieutenant and master,\r\ntaking by turns upon themselves the working of the ship, in the\r\ndifferent vessels; making and calculating observations for determining\r\nthe ship’s position, going through all possible manoeuvres and\r\nperforming the duties incident to the management of ships in action, in\r\nheavy weather, or in the many emergencies which arise requiring superior\r\nskill in seamanship. They were engaged in instructing the crews in\r\ngunnery, in infantry and sword-drill, and in drill of the battery. They\r\nwere also detailed for actual boat service, and for the transferring of\r\nhowitzers and marines from ship to shore. During the last cruise Meyer’s\r\ncode of signals was used by the graduating class as signal officers, in\r\ncommunicating from vessel to vessel in the fleet, and instruction was\r\nalso given in the Naval Code of signals, and in Navigation throughout\r\nthe cruise to all cadets on board. In addition to these cruises the\r\nyacht America, in charge of cadets of this class, as commanding\r\nofficers, has been engaged in the performance of despatch-boat duty, and\r\nalso special “coast picket duty” in search for the Tallahassee.\r\n\r\nThe experience of this class--made up of three advanced sections of what\r\nis now the second class (the graduating class of 1865,) would seem to\r\nindicate, that under a system of appointment that should admit from the\r\nstart only those who had maturity of mind and requisite scholarship, the\r\nprofessional studies of the Academy might be completed in three years.\r\nThis is one year longer than the course of the French Naval School at\r\nBrest, the entrance examination of which would exclude most of the\r\ngraduates of our Academy.\r\n\r\nIII. RECOMMENDATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe Visitors close their report with the following suggestions, as the\r\nresults of their examinations and conferences, in reference to the\r\nfurther development of the Naval Academy and the extension of nautical\r\neducation generally, for the consideration of the Department.\r\n\r\nI. Until the pupils of the Naval Academy have gone through the\r\ntheoretical and practical course of instruction provided in this\r\ninstitution expressly to qualify them to act as Midshipmen, the Visitors\r\nrecommend that they be designated as _Naval Cadets_--simply _candidates_\r\nfor the lowest official rank in the Navy--and that no cadet be rated as\r\nmidshipman, no matter how well up he may be in his studies, until he has\r\nhad at least eighteen months of professional practice afloat, towards\r\nwhich time the actual time at sea of each experimental cruise shall be\r\ncredited.\r\n\r\nII. As the most direct blow to the hindrances which practically exclude\r\na large portion of the youth of the country, no matter how strong may be\r\ntheir predilection or great their acquired fitness for the naval\r\nservice, from even a chance of being admitted to this national\r\nschool;--as the most effectual preventive of the disappointments now\r\nexperienced by individuals and families in the failure of many\r\nappointees to pass the entrance examination, or to meet even the low\r\nrequirements of the first year’s course;--as the only effectual way of\r\nridding the institution of the low average ability and attainments which\r\ncharacterize the lower sections of every class, and of bringing up the\r\ntalent and scholarship and conduct of the whole corps to the average of\r\nthe first two sections;--as a sure guaranty against the early\r\nresignation of officers educated at the public expense for a life\r\nservice in the Navy, and of a progressive and honorable career as long\r\nas life and health last;--as a powerful attraction to draw to this\r\ndepartment of the public service a fair share of the best talent and\r\nloftiest ambition of the youth of the country, and as a stimulus to\r\ntheir best efforts for self and school improvement for this purpose--the\r\nVisitors recommend the immediate abandonment of the custom of selecting\r\ncandidates for admission by individual patronage, in consideration of\r\nneighborhood, relationship, or party connection, or the better motives\r\nof the poverty or the public service of parents, and that all\r\nappointments be hereafter made in consideration of the personal merit of\r\nthe applicant, ascertained by a public competitive examination,\r\nconducted before an impartial tribunal, constituted as shall be\r\nprescribed by law. Admission, sought and obtained in this way, will be\r\nhonorable to the successful candidates, a source of pride to the\r\nneighborhood and State from which they come, a reward to the teachers\r\nwho have prepared them, and a stimulus to the industry and good conduct\r\nof their comrades at home. The classes of the Academy, replenished every\r\nyear by new recruits, all of whom have sought the service from personal\r\nchoice and won their place by personal merit founded on natural aptitude\r\nand vigor of mind and acquired knowledge, and who regard the diligent\r\nimprovement of these opportunities of professional study and practice as\r\nthe true road to honorable promotion hereafter, to be gained by farther\r\nindustry and devotion--will at once have an average ability and\r\nscholarship equal to that now attained by only five or six out of every\r\none hundred, and a large proportion of the cases of discipline, the\r\n“dead weights,” the reëxaminations, and the failures from inability,\r\ndistaste, or want of preparatory knowledge, will forever disappear from\r\nthe records of the Academy.\r\n\r\nThese suggestions have not the merit of originality nor the objections\r\nof novelty. The principle recommended has stood the test of seventy\r\nyears’ trial in France in naval and similar public schools, and is now\r\nin successful operation in England, as well as in most of the military\r\nschools of Europe. It has been again and again urged by thoughtful\r\nfriends of this institution and of our other national school at West\r\nPoint, as the most effectual remedy for the evils complained of. The\r\nAcademic Board of this Academy, in answer to a request from a committee\r\nin 1858 for its opinion on this point, replied:--“The Academic Board has\r\nlong been of the opinion that the present system of appointing\r\nmidshipmen without care in their selection, was undermining the very\r\nexistence of the institution. The records of the Academy show that\r\nscarcely more than one-fourth of those admitted graduate. The fault lies\r\nwith the appointing power, which has not kept the institution supplied\r\nwith the proper material, and the Board has been powerless in applying a\r\nremedy. It has done all in its power by recommending a higher standard\r\nof proficiency.” The Visitors for 1862, in the Report of their\r\nexaminations, remark:--“After a careful examination of the subject, the\r\nBoard has been forced to the conclusion that the selection of candidates\r\nhas not been made with sufficient reference to the wants of the public\r\nservice, but has been and continues to be regarded as a portion of the\r\npatronage of the members of Congress making the nominations. The evil\r\ndoes not stop here; for in many cases, after they have been appointed\r\nwithout regard to talents or fitness, and have obtained admission to the\r\ninstitution, and subsequently have been found incapable to pursue the\r\nstudies of the class to which they belong, the influence of the same\r\nmember of Congress originally nominating them is successfully used to\r\ncontinue them at the institution, in obtaining authority for them to\r\nrecommence their studies by joining a lower class; thus retaining those\r\nwanting in talents and fitness, to the exclusion of others of suitable\r\nqualifications that might be presented. An institution like this, in\r\nwhich the students are educated and supported by the government, ought\r\nto have them selected from the highest and most promising youths of the\r\ncountry.”[27]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 27: An early friend of this institution, on learning the\r\n    fact stated in the same Report of 1862, from which the above\r\n    extract is taken, “that in the course of six years one hundred and\r\n    twenty-four students were turned back to pursue a second time\r\n    portions of the academic course,” and of this number only six\r\n    passed the final examination, (thereby costing the country over\r\n    $300,000 in pay, salaries, and equipment, for absolutely nothing,\r\n    and at the same time depriving the naval service of an equal\r\n    number of competent young officers,) writes to a member of this\r\n    Board as follows:--“I have had the curiosity to question fifty\r\n    middies, as I happened to meet with them, without selection, and\r\n    representing different classes in the institution and different\r\n    States, as to the circumstances of their appointment--and of these\r\n    fifty, forty were the near relations or sons of political friends\r\n    of the parties making the nominations, and five were the sons of\r\n    persons in official stations at Washington, although appointed ‘at\r\n    large,’ leaving but five for selection from other sources. In\r\n    several cases the answers were significant--‘My father had to\r\n    bleed freely for my appointment.’ ‘My brother worked hard for his\r\n    election.’ ‘I had the promise of a cadetship at West Point, but as\r\n    there was no vacancy that year, I got an appointment here.’ ‘I am\r\n    an exchange. Senator ---- got an appointment for Mr. C.’s nephew,\r\n    and Mr. C. nominated Senator ---- friend’s son for the\r\n    place.’”--[_Ed. of Amer. Journal of Education._]]\r\n\r\nThe same general principle, selection by merit, ascertained by the same\r\ngeneral method, competitive examination, conducted on such conditions as\r\nCongress shall authorize or prescribe, has been recommended for\r\nappointments to the kindred national institution--the Military Academy\r\nat West Point--with the view of removing the same hindrances and\r\nremedying the same defects in the practical working of that school. That\r\neminent military teacher and administrator, General Thayer, under whom\r\nthe Academy, notwithstanding many hindrances and defects, attained its\r\nhighest development, recommended the adoption of this principle at the\r\noutset of his administration, after having seen its successful operation\r\nin the military schools of France; and he has recently, after the lapse\r\nof nearly fifty years, all of them spent in actual experience or\r\nobservation of the practical results of a different principle, renewed\r\nthe recommendation in a communication to the Secretary of War. He has,\r\nwithin the present year, declared his belief that the adoption at the\r\nstart, and the continuous recognition of this principle, the selection\r\nof candidates for admission on the ground of personal merit and aptitude\r\nfor the special purposes of the institution, in appointments to the\r\nMilitary Academy, would have more than doubled its usefulness, would\r\nhave avoided most of the difficulties of administration which it has\r\nencountered, would have prevented the popular prejudices which\r\ndemagogues and disappointed parents and Congressmen have fostered, and\r\nwould have gained for it a larger measure of the popular favor.\r\n\r\nThe Visitors of the Military Academy for 1863, in their Report to the\r\nSecretary of War, go into an extended discussion of the advantages and\r\nobjections to this principle and mode of making appointments. To this\r\ndocument reference is made as embodying the convictions of this Board as\r\nto the probable working of the same principle in admissions to the Naval\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nIII. In connection with a change in the mode of appointment, the\r\nVisitors would commend to the consideration of the Department a revision\r\nof the conditions as to the age, bodily vigor, and general knowledge of\r\ncandidates. The old system of training naval officers, by placing boys\r\nat the early age of twelve or fourteen years on shipboard in the daily\r\nand constant practice of the routine of the ship, when accompanied with\r\nthe parental oversight of the captain as to conduct, and with regular\r\nand progressive instruction in the science and art of his profession, on\r\nship and shore, by the teacher of mathematics and navigation--has\r\nproduced many capable commanders, out of the larger number who have been\r\nruined for the want of proper supervision and instruction, or grown up\r\ninto men of mere routine. Some of the brightest names in the records of\r\nour own and of the English naval service had no other education or\r\ntraining than this. But these are the exceptions, and their success was\r\nas much due to opportunity and original genius, as to their early and\r\ncontinuous ship experience. That system of training officers is,\r\nhowever, everywhere abandoned, and the present aim of every naval power\r\nin the world is to seek out young men having a fondness for sea-life,\r\nwith a generous ambition for naval distinction, with an aptitude for the\r\nsciences which qualify and adorn the naval officer, with vigor of body\r\nto bear the inevitable exposures of the service, and with a large amount\r\nof general knowledge, and then subject them to a special course of\r\nprofessional study and practice in a naval school. For every stage of\r\npromotion, additional knowledge as well as professional experience,\r\ntested by successive rigid examinations, are required. The experience of\r\nthis class of schools indicates that those original qualities and\r\nacquired qualifications deemed indispensable in candidates for the\r\nproper mastery of a thorough course of naval instruction, can not often\r\nbe found in young men under eighteen years of age.\r\n\r\nIV. With an advance in the average age, maturity of mind, and\r\npreparatory attainments of the cadets on admission, the Visitors believe\r\na revision and readjustment of the subjects and course of instruction\r\ncan be advantageously made, which in connection with the new schools of\r\nnaval construction, and of marine engineering, would greatly extend the\r\nrange, depth, and practical value of the education of the naval officer,\r\nwithout prolonging the time now devoted to its acquisition. If the\r\nAcademy can be relieved of the large amount of merely elementary general\r\neducation which every graduate of the common schools of the country\r\nought to have received, and which in a few years every aspirant to the\r\nprivileges of this school would contrive to get, if the law made its\r\nacquisition necessary as a preliminary to a competitive\r\nexamination--then the whole general scientific course could be mastered\r\nin two years, with a large amount of military and naval tactics, as well\r\nas of practical seamanship in the two summer cruises. At this point the\r\nVisitors recommend to the consideration of the Department the\r\nestablishment of the following departments, or schools, in each of which\r\nthe course of instruction shall be far more comprehensive and thorough\r\nthan is now practicable where the branches constitute parts of a single\r\ncourse:--\r\n\r\n_First._--Of Navigation and Seamanship.\r\n\r\n_Second._--Of Naval Ordnance and Practical Gunnery.\r\n\r\n_Third._--Of Hydrography, Marine Surveying, Astronomical Observations,\r\nConstruction of Charts, &c.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._--Of Drawing, Naval Designs, Construction of Ships, Naval\r\nMachinery, Docks, &c.\r\n\r\n_Fifth._--Of Steam and Marine Engineering.\r\n\r\n_Sixth._--Of Naval History and Strategy, International Law--especially\r\nof belligerents and neutrals--and the Law of the Sea, Consular Duties,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n_Seventh._--Of Modern Languages.\r\n\r\nInto each of these schools let the cadets be drafted, the choice to be\r\ndetermined by their own predilection or comparative fitness, at the\r\nclose of the second year, and after completing such number of these\r\ncourses, not less than four, as may be prescribed, let them have the\r\nprivilege of an examination.\r\n\r\nEach of these departments or schools might be opened to a certain number\r\nof candidates, on competitive examination, from each State--no matter\r\nwhere they may have received their education--and permission might be\r\ngiven to officers of any rank to review and extend their knowledge of\r\neither of these departments with the more advanced text-books and means\r\nof instruction. By this arrangement the service will secure the highest\r\ndevelopment of any special aptitude, preparation, or experience--and\r\nwill more frequently get “the right man in the right place.”\r\n\r\nThe importance of these great departments of the naval service, and of\r\nspecial preparation for them, is fully appreciated by the Academic\r\nBoard, but any attempt to give this preparation to all the members of\r\nthe present classes, with such unequal and deficient preparatory\r\nknowledge and with such diverse aptitudes for particular branches, would\r\nbe futile. The attempt to teach as much as is now done, under the\r\ncircumstances, only produces confused and unsatisfactory results with a\r\nlarge portion of the class. The remedy for this state of things seems to\r\nthe Visitors to be in:--\r\n\r\n1. More thorough preparation, higher average ability, and greater\r\nmaturity of mind on the part of the cadets.\r\n\r\n2. A thorough scientific course up to a certain point, for all the\r\ncadets, to occupy two years.\r\n\r\n3. The requiring of linguistic training (in one or more modern\r\nlanguages,) only of those who show some aptitude or previous preparation\r\nfor the same.\r\n\r\n4. An option of two or three of the above courses, and a thorough\r\nproficiency in those selected before being permitted to pass as\r\nmidshipman.\r\n\r\n5. And finally continuation of study as well as of practice after\r\ngraduation in the directions for which there is a demonstrated fitness\r\nand ability.\r\n\r\nV. The Visitors deem it desirable to concentrate in and around the Naval\r\nAcademy the largest amount and the highest quality of teaching ability,\r\nnaval experience, and the apparatus and opportunities of practice of\r\nevery kind connected with the naval service. But they would also commend\r\nto the consideration of the Department the encouragement of Naval\r\nInstitutes, or temporary courses of instruction, at suitable seasons of\r\nthe year, in some of the great departments of naval education specified\r\nin the foregoing classification--for the benefit of officers on\r\nfurlough, or connected with the National Dockyards and Depositories,\r\nespecially those in the neighborhood of large collegiate institutions,\r\non the request of a certain number of such officers. Private naval\r\narchitects and shipmasters might also be invited to attend these\r\nInstitutes. Something of this kind should be provided, especially if\r\ncontinued study and examination is required by law and regulation at\r\nevery stage of promotion in the naval service.\r\n\r\nVI. The absence of elementary naval schools and of any regular\r\ninstruction in navigation, the want of nationality and the low condition\r\nof the seaman-class generally, prevents any considerable demonstration\r\nor recognition of that nautical taste and aptitude for sea-life in the\r\ngreat mass of the population, which ought to be the basis of all special\r\nnautical training. To remedy this state of things, to develope and\r\ncultivate, where it exists, a desire for a maritime career, to provide\r\nat once a supply of intelligent, hardy, and well-trained seamen, mates,\r\nand masters, for the national as well as for the commercial marine, in\r\ntime of peace as well as in the emergencies of a sudden Or a great war,\r\nthe Visitors recommend the inauguration, under the auspices of the Naval\r\nDepartment, of a system of navigation schools and naval instruction, in\r\naddition to and in connection with our present system of naval\r\napprenticeship, commensurate with the demands of the service, the\r\ncountry, and the age. As the basis of this system, they recommend the\r\nimmediate offer of pecuniary aid to encourage the establishment of a\r\nclass of navigation schools in all the large seaports of the country,\r\nsubject to thorough national inspection in order to secure uniformity\r\nand efficiency. They do not deem it necessary to consider here the\r\norganization, management, and instruction of this class of schools,\r\nfarther than to present the outline of a system.\r\n\r\n1. The schools which they contemplate, are not to be government\r\nschools--although they will be aided and inspected by the Naval\r\nDepartment. Their original establishment, buildings, material,\r\nequipment, and immediate management will belong to the local Board of\r\nTrade or Commerce representing the shipping and commercial interests of\r\nthe communities in which they are located. Through such Board, the State\r\nor municipal authorities, or individuals, can extend pecuniary aid for\r\nthe original outfit or annual support.\r\n\r\n2. The objects aimed at in the internal constitution of the schools and\r\nclasses, will be thorough instruction in navigation, seamanship, and\r\nkindred branches through:--_First_--Evening classes for adults, (seamen,\r\nmates, or masters,) who can not attend regularly on account of absence\r\nfrom port or engagements by day, in which the instruction will\r\nnecessarily be elementary and fragmentary; _Second_--A junior department\r\nor division, in which instruction in arithmetic, drawing, commercial\r\ngeography, and statistics, will be given, as well as in navigation, the\r\nuse of instruments, calculation of observations, keeping a log-book,\r\njournal, &c; _Third_--A senior department, in which a thorough course of\r\nmathematics, navigation, nautical astronomy, steam and steam navigation,\r\n&c., will be given, with facilities for acquiring one or more of the\r\nlanguages of the nations with which we have large commercial dealings.\r\n\r\n3. The extension of any government aid should be based on the condition\r\nthat suitable buildings and material equipment are furnished and kept in\r\nrepair and working order by the local Board, or committee of the same,\r\ncharged with the immediate management of the school; and such aid shall\r\nbe subject to reduction and withdrawal for the succeeding year on the\r\nrecommendation of the Department inspectors. For the first year the only\r\ncondition should be the actual payment, from other sources, of an equal\r\namount for the annual expense of the school, subject to the disposal of\r\nthe local Board. For the second and subsequent years, the sum paid by\r\nthe government shall be appropriated in portions; _First_--a specific\r\nsum to the principal teacher and assistants according to the grade of\r\ncertificated qualification each may hold; _Second_--a specific sum to\r\nthe managers of each school for the annual expense of the same,\r\naccording the average daily or evening attendance of the whole number\r\nenrolled in each class or division for a specified period of time in\r\neach year; _Third_--a specific sum to the managers of each school\r\naccording to the number of pupils who shall complete certain specified\r\ncourses of study to the satisfaction of the inspectors upon examination\r\nby them; _Fourth_--a specified sum in prizes, in the form of\r\nchronometers, sextants, text-books in navigation, &c., to be competed\r\nfor by all the pupils of each division of a school; _Fifth_--a specified\r\nsum in aid of such professional experience as can be secured for the\r\nyounger members of the school, as is now given to naval apprentices. All\r\npayments by the government should be so made as to secure and reward the\r\nservices of able and faithful teachers, the regular, punctual, and\r\nprolonged attendance of pupils to the completion of each course which\r\nthey enter, and the liberal coöperation of the local municipal\r\nauthorities and the commercial and shipping portions of the community in\r\nwhich the school is located. Without such coöperation the whole plan\r\nwill fail. The school need not be free--but let the instruction be good,\r\npractical, and cheap, and its possessor be sure of a lucrative\r\nemployment, and then there will be a demand for it.\r\n\r\nAnd why should not the national government enter upon this or a better\r\ndevised system of training its own seamen, and advancing its naval and\r\ncommercial interests? All maritime nations, either directly and\r\nexclusively by the central government, or through local boards of trade\r\nand commerce, have aimed to protect the lives and property of citizens\r\nengaged in commerce and navigation, by providing not only for the\r\nerection of light houses, buoys, and other material safeguards, but also\r\nby an adequate supply of competent pilots and mariners, duly trained and\r\ncommissioned. Our own government has recognized its duty in all these\r\nrespects, and in the recent enormous expansion and peculiar risks of the\r\nsteam-marine, has established a system of inspection which is intended\r\nto reach every engine used for the propulsion of every vessel of any\r\nclass in all waters subject to national law. Surely the same policy\r\nwhich permits and justifies this interference of the national arm and\r\nthe application of the national resources to build light-houses, erect\r\nbuoys, register the names, tonnage, and ownership of vessels; which\r\ncommissions pilots, inspects steam-boilers, surveys harbors, makes\r\nobservations of the stars, the currents of the ocean and the prevalent\r\ndirections of the winds in different seasons and latitudes; constructs\r\nand circulates maps and charts, and does all these things for the\r\nprotection of commerce and for the use of the navy, will, in behalf of\r\nthe same great interests, when satisfied that they are jeopardized by\r\npresent neglect, see and be assured that the masters, mates, and seamen,\r\nwho have all the precious lives and enormous properties embarked in\r\ncommerce in their keeping, are properly trained in the science and art\r\nof navigation.\r\n\r\nThe liberal educational policy of the national government which has set\r\napart over one hundred millions of acres of the national domain for\r\neducational purposes, which if the right of inspection into its\r\napplication had been asserted and exercised, would have amounted ere\r\nthis time to a permanent fund of over five hundred millions of\r\ndollars--and which has more recently appropriated over six hundred\r\nthousand acres of public land for the establishment of agricultural and\r\nscientific schools;--the similar policy of the State governments, that\r\nholds all property subject to taxation for the support of schools, and\r\nthat authorizes the most munificent appropriations for free public\r\nschools in all of the large cities, which are also the great seaports of\r\nthe country--all justify the belief that a system of education for this\r\nlarge class of the community, once fairly entered upon by the national\r\ngovernment, will be cheerfully and liberally responded to and sustained.\r\n\r\nIn England the same necessity which exists in this country--the\r\nreluctance of young people in good circumstances, to enter the maritime\r\nservice--the low state of the professional as well as general education\r\nof her seaman-class--the enormous amount of property and the large\r\nnumber of lives directly interested in commerce and navigation--the\r\nreliance for properly manning the national vessels in the sudden\r\nemergency of war, on the commercial marine--the representative character\r\nwhich mariners bear, of the religion, manners, and civilization\r\ngenerally of the country, to all nations which they visit--the desire\r\nfor the elevation of this large class of the population in intelligence,\r\nmorality, and physical well-being, for its own sake as well as for the\r\nhappiness, safety, and glory of the whole country--has prompted the\r\ngovernment to organize a system of nautical education, not only for\r\nofficers, gunners, architects, shipwrights, engineers, seamen, and boys\r\nemployed directly in the national service, but for the masters, mates,\r\nsailors, and boys in her large commercial marine. Prior to 1853, the\r\nwhole reliance of that country for the professional education of masters\r\nand mates was their registration after an examination in the mere\r\nmechanical knowledge of navigation and seamanship. To obtain this\r\nknowledge, reliance was placed on the economic law of supply and demand,\r\nand in this case as in others of an intellectual and moral nature, the\r\nleast demand was made by those in the greatest want. Only here and\r\nthere, in the great seaport towns, individuals poorly qualified in most\r\ninstances, opened schools and classes of navigation, in which\r\ninstruction of the most elementary and mechanical character was given\r\nwithout system, to a very small number, and without supervision or\r\nresponsibility. In 1853, after the great International Exhibition had\r\ndemonstrated the superiority of France and other continental nations, in\r\nthe scientific as well as artistic training of their industrial classes,\r\nthe English Government constituted a Department of Art and Science to\r\nadminister a large appropriation (amounting annually to nearly a\r\nhalf-million of dollars) so as to extend encouragement to local\r\ninstitutions of practical science scattered in all the principal centers\r\nof population, and acting in every department of industry, all subject\r\nto the visits of government inspectors. To this Department of Science\r\nand Art was assigned the extension of pecuniary encouragement to, and\r\nthe inspection of a class of schools which had been instituted by the\r\nMercantile Marine Department of the (governmental) Board of Trade, in\r\nconnection with local boards of commerce and trade, for the benefit of\r\nthe navigation interests of the country. These schools in 1863 had\r\nincreased to eighteen--each in an important seaport--each under the\r\nmanagement of a local committee--each having a fair attendance of boys,\r\nseamen, mates, and masters, who all paid small fees. The system is still\r\nin its infancy, but continues to enjoy the confidence of the government\r\nand of the large commercial houses.\r\n\r\nNor is this system of governmental aid and inspection of marine and\r\nnavigation schools, confined to England. In all the continental states\r\nin which the commerce is large enough to require the aid of government\r\nin any form for its protection, as well as for the indirect advantage of\r\nthe navy, this class of schools exists--and in some the national policy\r\nin this respect is most comprehensive and thorough. In France, the\r\ngovernment in its gigantic efforts within the last twenty-five years to\r\nestablish a navy which in the number, design, construction, and armament\r\nof its vessels, in the scientific and professional knowledge of the\r\nofficers, and the practical intelligence of her seaman, should be equal\r\nto that of any other nation--has included the whole commercial marine in\r\nits operations. Encouragement is given to private shipyards, architects,\r\nand founderies; and the system of maritime “inscription” or enrollment\r\nis so thorough that there is not a master nor an engineer in the\r\ncommercial service who has not served at least two years in the national\r\ndockyards, founderies, or ships, and enjoyed opportunities of\r\nprofessional study, as well as practice, of the most scientific\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nVII. To give unity, stability, thoroughness, and general efficiency to\r\nthe inspection and operations of the large system of naval education\r\ncontemplated in the foregoing suggestions, the Visitors recommend the\r\nappointment of a Council or Board of Naval Education, in the\r\nconstitution of which the great features of such a system should be\r\nrepresented, viz.:--(1.) Experience and success in naval command. (2.)\r\nExperience in large commercial and maritime affairs. (3.) Success in\r\nnaval construction. (4.) Success in the instruction and discipline of\r\neducational institutions. (5.) A new infusion every year of the popular\r\nelement, by the appointment from year to year of one or more\r\npublic-spirited citizens from different sections of the country to\r\nattend the local examinations of applicants for admission, and the\r\nannual examinations of the several institutions.\r\n\r\nTo this Board should be assigned the duty of (1.) Frequent personal\r\ninspection and examination at other than stated periods. (2.) The\r\nthorough examination by themselves, and in connection with the\r\nprofessors, of the several classes in their daily recitations. (3.) The\r\nexamination by themselves, or by competent experts, of all candidates\r\nfor admission, of which as far as practicable, the written answers of\r\nthe candidates should be preserved, and a written report in detail\r\nshould be filed away for reference.\r\n\r\nThe language used in the law under which the present Board of Visitors\r\nare appointed--“for the purpose of _witnessing_ the examination of the\r\nseveral classes”--if taken literally, would certainly justify the\r\npractice adopted by this, and as far as they can learn, by previous\r\nBoards. At all events, the constitution of this and previous Boards,\r\ncomposed as it is of members a majority of whom have had no experience\r\nin school examinations--who have had no acquaintance with this\r\ninstitution before their present appointment--and who are together for\r\nbut a short period of time, is very inadequate for any purpose of\r\nthorough personal examination. They must be satisfied in the main to\r\nreceive statements on trust, and to receive and communicate only general\r\nimpressions. All the duties devolving upon the Board of Visitors as at\r\npresent organized, could be far more efficiently and successfully\r\nperformed in connection with the other duties of the Council of Naval\r\nEducation, here suggested.\r\n\r\nVIII. With a programme of studies so extensive as that now laid down or\r\nas herein proposed, in which each study is, or should be arranged with\r\nreference to what has gone before, as well as to what is to follow, the\r\nprofessor of each department and the teacher of each branch and section,\r\nshould be kept closely to his portion, each cadet should master\r\nthoroughly every step in the succession, no professor should encroach\r\nupon the time of another, no teacher should be allowed to pass his\r\npupils indifferently prepared into the succeeding section or branch.\r\nEven if no change be made in the present programme this course is\r\nessential to the success of the school, and to secure this an Inspector\r\nof Studies should be appointed, who should report frequently to the\r\nAcademic Board all and every infraction of the programme, so that it may\r\nbe ascertained whether the cause of failure be in the programme, or the\r\nclass, or the teacher; and the remedy at once applied. Both the special\r\nand general duties of the Commandant preclude the constant and minute\r\ninspection referred to, and to the professor of no one department can\r\nthese duties be properly assigned. While there is a superior executive\r\nofficer who has in charge the external administration of the affairs of\r\nthe Academy, there is no corresponding officer, as in the opinion of the\r\nVisitors there should be, to preside over the vital matters of\r\ninstruction and training.\r\n\r\nIX. The appointment of professors and assistants is a subject from its\r\nimportance at all times, and from its immediate bearing upon the welfare\r\nof the school, deserving of mature consideration. The efficiency and\r\nthoroughness of instruction, the spirit of diligent study and the\r\nenthusiastic love of it among the midshipmen, depend to a great degree,\r\nupon the fitness of the instructor for his post and the method and\r\nmanner of teaching which he employs. Though there may be some reason for\r\nlimiting their appointment to the graduates of the Academy, yet the\r\npresent course of instruction has by no means in view the training of\r\nfuture teachers, nor has it yet reached its full development. The\r\nsuccess and advancement of the institution would seem to require the\r\nemployment of the best educational talent, and none other, to be\r\nobtained wherever it can be found. Whenever any vacancy is to be filled,\r\nor new appointments to be made, the Visitors recommend that due notice\r\nof the same be given, and that the credentials of all applicants be\r\nreferred to a competent board, and the applicants themselves whose\r\ncredentials are satisfactory, be subjected to an open, competitive\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nX. In conclusion, the Visitors recommend that greater publicity be given\r\nto all the documents which set forth the object and operations of the\r\nNaval Academy, the mode and conditions of nominating midshipmen, the\r\nname of the person responsible for a nomination, the requisitions and\r\nresults of each entrance as well as of all annual examinations, with\r\nspecimens of the questions asked and answers given, so far as the same\r\nwere written or printed. They would respectfully urge that the Official\r\nRegister of the Academy, with the above and other information deemed\r\nnecessary by the Department, be sent not only to every member of\r\nCongress, but to the libraries of all principal High Schools, public and\r\nprivate, and all institutions where candidates are prepared, that both\r\nteachers and pupils may know what the Department requires as preliminary\r\nto the special professional training provided in this Academy for any\r\nbranch of the naval service of the country, and especially how\r\ndeplorably deficient a large proportion of the candidates are found to\r\nbe, on only a moderately strict but impartial examination. To this\r\nRegister might be appended the official report of the Bureau charged\r\nwith its supervision, or of any Board of Visitors, or Special Examiners,\r\nappointed by the Department.\r\n\r\nWith the best permanent accommodations and equipment of the Academy that\r\ncan be made at Annapolis or elsewhere--with schools or courses of\r\nscientific and practical instruction for every branch of the service,\r\nand for every stage of promotion--with a teaching staff so numerous and\r\nso diversified as to secure the advantage of special attainment and\r\nqualifications to each branch of study--with entire control of the\r\npupil’s time--with hospital accommodations and medical services for the\r\nsick--with chaplains for religious observances and the moral culture of\r\nall--with regular alternations of physical exercise and intellectual\r\nlabor, and the stimulus of an honorable distinction before and after\r\ngraduation--the Visitors think it not unreasonable to expect from an\r\ninstitution so provided for, the highest results, especially as the\r\ngovernment has it in its power to select for admission, without regard\r\nto the social or political status of parents, from among the entire\r\nyouth of the country, those who are best fitted by their physical and\r\nmental endowment and preliminary education, as well as by their aptitude\r\nfor special studies and predilection for the naval service, for which\r\nthose studies are a preparation.\r\n\r\nAll which is respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n  JOHN MARSTON, _Commodore U.S. Navy, President_.\r\n  JAMES A. HAMILTON, _New York_.\r\n  JOHN RODGERS, _Commodore U.S. Navy_.\r\n  CHARLES D. ROBINSON, _Wisconsin_.\r\n  G. D. A. PARKS, _Illinois_.\r\n  C. W. PICKERING, _Capt. U.S. Navy_.\r\n  JOHN W. HARRIS, _Missouri_.\r\n  HENRY BARNARD, _Connecticut_.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate expense of the Military Academy at West Point, and the\r\nNaval Academy at Annapolis, to the country, is not represented by the\r\nspecific sums which appear in the annual appropriation for the military\r\nand naval service, but is increased by the large sums paid to officers\r\nand men who are detailed to these posts for police, instructional, and\r\nother purposes of these institutions. The cost to the government of each\r\ncadet from his admission to his graduation in either Academy, exceeds\r\n$10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAVAL CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING.\r\n\r\nUnder authority of an Act of Congress (July 4, 1864), the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy, in 1865, made provision at Annapolis for a course of\r\ninstruction for a class of Assistant-Engineers, composed of persons\r\nadmitted on competitive examination, many of whom had secured a\r\npreliminary scientific training, and all of whom gave evidence of\r\naptitude for such occupation and of having had experience in the\r\nfabrication of steam machinery. There was every indication of a special\r\nschool for this department of the naval service, when the enterprise was\r\nsuspended; but to be revived under the following Regulations, issued by\r\nSecretary Robeson, April 4, 1871:\r\n\r\nREGULATIONS FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF CADET ENGINEERS.\r\n\r\n  I. In pursuance of the third and fourth sections of an act passed at\r\nthe first session of the 38th Congress, approved July 4, 1864, “_To\r\nauthorize the Secretary of the Navy to provide for the education of\r\nNaval Constructors and Engineers, and for other purposes_,” and of the\r\nsecond section of an act passed at the first session of the 39th\r\nCongress, approved March 2, 1867, entitled, “_An Act to amend certain\r\nacts in relation to the Navy_,” applications will be received by the\r\nNavy Department for the appointment of Cadet Engineers.\r\n\r\n  II. The application is to be addressed to the Secretary of the Navy,\r\nand can be made by the candidate, or by any person for him, and his name\r\nwill be placed on the register. The registry of a name gives no\r\nassurance of an appointment, and no preference will be given in the\r\nselection to priority of application.\r\n\r\n  III. The number of Cadet Engineers is limited by law to fifty. The\r\ncandidate must be not less than eighteen nor more than twenty-two years\r\nof age; he will be required to certify _on honor_ to his precise age, to\r\nthe Academic Board, previous to his examination, and no one will be\r\nexamined who is over or under the prescribed age. His application must\r\nbe accompanied by satisfactory evidence of moral character and health,\r\nwith information regarding date of birth and educational advantages\r\nhitherto enjoyed. Candidates who receive permission will present\r\nthemselves to the Superintendent of the Naval Academy between the 15th\r\nand 25th of September for examination as to their qualifications.\r\n\r\n  IV. The course of study will comprise two academic years. All Cadets\r\nwho graduate will be warranted as Assistant Engineers in the Navy. The\r\npay of a Cadet Engineer is the same as that of a Cadet Midshipman.\r\n\r\n  V. The academic examination previous to appointment will be on the\r\nfollowing subjects, namely: _Arithmetic_: the candidate will be examined\r\nin numeration and the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and\r\ndivision of whole numbers, and of vulgar and decimal fractions; in\r\nreduction; in proportion or rule of three, direct and inverse;\r\nextraction of square and cube roots. In _Algebra_, (Bourdon’s,) through\r\nequations of the first degree. In _Geometry_, (Davies’ Legendre,)\r\nthrough the plane figures. _Rudimentary Natural Philosophy. Reading_: he\r\nmust read clearly and intelligibly from any English narrative work, as,\r\nfor example, Bancroft’s History of the United States. In _Writing_ and\r\n_Spelling_: he must write from dictation, in a legible hand, and spell\r\nwith correctness, both orally and in writing. In English _Grammar_ and\r\nEnglish _Composition_ he will be examined as to the parts of speech, the\r\nrules connected therewith, and the elementary construction of sentences,\r\nand will be required to write such original paragraphs as will show that\r\nhe has a proper knowledge of the subject. The candidate will also be\r\nrequired to exhibit a fair degree of proficiency in pencil-sketching,\r\nand to produce satisfactory evidence of mechanical aptitude. Candidates\r\nwho possess greatest skill and experience in the practical knowledge of\r\nmachinery, other qualifications being equal, shall have precedence for\r\nadmission.\r\n\r\n  VI. Any of the following conditions will be sufficient to reject a\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\n  Feeble constitution, permanently impaired general health, decided\r\ncachexia, all chronic diseases or injuries that permanently impair\r\nefficiency, viz:\r\n\r\n  1. Infectious disorders.\r\n\r\n  2. Weak or disordered intellect.\r\n\r\n  3. Unnatural curvature of spine.\r\n\r\n  4. Epilepsy, or other convulsion, within five years.\r\n\r\n  5. Chronic impaired vision, or chronic disease of the organs of\r\nvision.\r\n\r\n  6. Great permanent hardness of hearing, or chronic disease of the\r\nears.\r\n\r\n  7. Loss or decay of teeth to such an extent as to interfere with\r\ndigestion and impair health.\r\n\r\n  8. Impediment of speech to such an extent as to impair efficiency in\r\nthe performance of duty.\r\n\r\n  9. Decided indications of liability to pulmonary disease.\r\n\r\n  10. Permanent inefficiency of either of the extremities.\r\n\r\n  11. Hernia.\r\n\r\n  12. Incurable sarcocele, hydrocele, fistula, stricture, or\r\nhæmorrhoids.\r\n\r\n  13. Large varicose veins of lower limbs. Chronic ulcers.\r\n\r\n  14. Attention will also be paid to the stature of the candidate, and\r\nno one _manifestly_ undersized for his age will be received into the\r\nAcademy. In case of doubt about the physical condition of the candidate\r\nany marked deviation from the usual standard of height will add\r\nmaterially to the consideration for rejection.\r\n\r\n  15. The Board will exercise a proper discretion in the application of\r\nthe above conditions to each case, rejecting no candidate who is likely\r\nto be efficient in the service, and admitting no one who is likely to\r\nprove physically inefficient.\r\n\r\n  VII. If both these examinations result favorably, the candidate will\r\nreceive an appointment as a Cadet Engineer, become an inmate of the\r\nAcademy, and will be allowed his actual and necessary traveling expenses\r\nfrom his residence to the Naval Academy, and be required to sign\r\narticles by which he will bind himself to serve in the United States\r\nNavy six years, (including his term of probation at the Naval Academy,)\r\nunless sooner discharged. If, on the contrary, he shall not pass both of\r\nthese examinations, he will receive neither an appointment nor his\r\ntraveling expenses, nor can he have the privilege of another examination\r\nfor admission _to the same class_ unless recommended by the Board.\r\n\r\n  VIII. When candidates shall have passed the required examinations, and\r\nbeen admitted as members of the Academy, they must immediately furnish\r\nthemselves with the following articles, viz:\r\n\r\n    One navy-blue uniform suit,\r\n    One fatigue suit,\r\n    One navy-blue uniform cap,\r\n    One uniform overcoat,\r\n    Ten pairs of white pants,\r\n    Four white vests,\r\n    Six white shirts,\r\n    Six pairs of socks,\r\n    Four pairs of drawers,\r\n    Six pocket handkerchiefs,\r\n    One black silk handk’f or stock,\r\n    One mattress,\r\n    One pillow,\r\n    One pair of blankets,\r\n    One bed cover or spread,\r\n    Two pairs of sheets,\r\n    Four pillow cases,\r\n    Six towels,\r\n    Two pairs of shoes or boots,\r\n    One hair-brush,\r\n    One clothes-brush,\r\n    One coarse comb for the hair,\r\n    One fine comb for the hair,\r\n    One tumbler or mug, and\r\n    One thread and needle case.\r\n\r\n  Room-mates will jointly procure, for their common use, one\r\nlooking-glass, one wash-basin, one water-pail, one slop-bucket, and one\r\nbroom. These articles may be obtained from the store-keeper of good\r\nquality and at fair prices.\r\n\r\n  IX. Each Cadet Engineer must, on admission, deposit with the paymaster\r\nthe sum of seventy-five dollars, for which he will be credited on the\r\nbooks of that officer, to be expended by direction of the Superintendent\r\nfor the purchase of text-books and other authorized articles besides\r\nthose above enumerated.\r\n\r\n  X. While at the Academy the Cadets will be examined, from time to\r\ntime, according to the regulations prescribed by the Navy Department;\r\nand if found deficient at any examination, or dismissed for misconduct,\r\nthey cannot, by law, be continued in the Academy or Naval service,\r\nexcept upon recommendation of the Academic Board.\r\n\r\n  XI. A Cadet Engineer who voluntarily resigns his appointment will be\r\nrequired to refund the amount paid him for traveling expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTION, TRAINING AND PROMOTION OF SEAMEN.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nUnder the constitutional powers “to regulate commerce with foreign\r\nnations and among the several States,” and “to provide and maintain a\r\nnavy,” Congress, it is believed, can do more than is now done to provide\r\nboth the military and commercial marine with intelligent, hardy and\r\nskillful sailors, as well as mates and captains, and to elevate the\r\nposition of the whole seamen class.\r\n\r\nThe frightful accidents from explosions caused by badly constructed, or\r\nworn out steam-boilers, led to a system of national inspection which has\r\ndone something to diminish the loss of life and property from this\r\nsource, in vessels engaged in commerce on the ocean or our inland\r\nwaters--but a system of instruction, examination, and promotion, under\r\nnational authority, with national aid and the cöoperation of the\r\nmercantile community, of all persons intrusted with the command and\r\nnavigation of all vessels, registered as national shipping, would put an\r\nend to all that class of disasters to life and property which is now\r\nattributable _to ignorance and want of experience_--and which is\r\nregarded by underwriters as much the largest portion of all marine\r\ndisasters.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of doing something led to the establishment of the naval\r\napprentice system, under the Act of March 2, 1837.\r\n\r\nThe original trial was not inaugurated under favorable conditions, and\r\nwas prematurely abandoned, under the economical action of Congress which\r\ncompelled the department to elect between men and boys for its arduous\r\nservice. In 1864 the system was revived by Secretary Welles, a vessel\r\nwas placed under the command of a competent officer, and a promising\r\nclass of boys, after a preliminary examination were enlisted, and the\r\nwork of their instruction was begun by training them in all the details\r\nof a sailor’s duty at sea. The Secretary in his Report for 1866,\r\nexpressed himself hopeful of the results--but urged Congress to further\r\nlegislation, to make the system attractive, by holding out to the most\r\ndeserving members of the class, appointments to the Naval Academy, and a\r\nretiring pension after twenty years’ service. His suggestions were not\r\nheeded, and under the limitations of the Act of 1866 the trial failed.\r\n\r\nCommodore Jenkins, Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, having cognizance\r\nof Naval Apprentices, in his Report for 1866, remarks:\r\n\r\n  A judicious naval apprentice system will secure to the navy every\r\nyear, after the first enlisted boys are thoroughly trained and educated,\r\na sufficient number of well-disciplined and better instructed seamen to\r\ngive tone and character to the crews of our vessels of war than\r\nheretofore, and if the enlistments were unlimited it would require only\r\na few years to provide all the seamen necessary for a formidable naval\r\npeace establishment.\r\n\r\n  But it is not the navy alone that is or ought to be greatly interested\r\nin the success of the naval apprentice system. Every ship-owner and\r\nshipper in the country will be directly or indirectly benefited as well\r\nas the navy. Many of the apprentices will, at the expiration of their\r\napprenticeship, seek service on board of merchant vessels, where the\r\nadvantages of their previous training and education will be felt.\r\n\r\n  If there were training-ships in every port of the United States for\r\napprentices to the sea service, and the apprentices, after being taught\r\nthe rudiments of an English education and all the seamanship that could\r\nbe taught on board of a vessel in port, were sent on long sea voyages,\r\nthe seamen of the country would soon become more elevated in character\r\nthan they are at present, and ship-owners would realize the importance\r\nof cherishing and protecting a valuable class of our countrymen who are\r\nnow left to the tender mercies of hard-hearted landlords, crimps, and\r\nrunners.\r\n\r\n  It is a great mistake to suppose that steam vessels can be managed\r\nwell by landsmen at sea. The terrible shipwrecks, loss of numbers of\r\nindividuals, and of millions of dollars’ worth of property annually on\r\nthe ocean, is in the main attributable to bad management, ignorance, and\r\nwant of experience of those in charge of the vessels. It is as necessary\r\nthat sea steamers should be officered and manned by expert seamen as it\r\nwas in former times for clipper and other sailing vessels. A good\r\nknowledge of seamanship is only to be acquired by a long apprenticeship;\r\nnor does the ability to navigate a vessel from one port to another make\r\na man a seaman. There is no vocation, profession, or calling which\r\nrequires a more varied knowledge and a greater experience than that of\r\nan expert seaman. It is not sufficient that he should know how to knot\r\nand splice a rope, to reef and furl a sail, to take his trick at the\r\nhelm, or to give correct soundings in heaving the lead. He must be a\r\ngood judge of the appearances of the weather, know how to lay his vessel\r\nto and under what canvas for safety, on what tack to put his vessel to\r\navoid the strength of the approaching gale or hurricane, when to run and\r\nwhen to lie to, and he must be fertile in resources to save his vessel\r\nin case of danger or disaster at sea. The expert seaman is a man full of\r\nresources, and ever ready to turn his knowledge and experience to good\r\naccount; but such is not the estimate of him by those who only know him\r\nas an outcast of society, without friends and without influence.\r\n\r\n  As education and careful training elevate those who are engaged in the\r\ndifferent pursuits on shore, the same means, if judiciously employed,\r\nwill elevate and make useful and respectable in their sphere that much\r\nneglected and greatly oppressed class of our fellow-citizens--the\r\nAmerican sailor.\r\n\r\n_Navigation Schools for the Mercantile Marine._\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the success of still another trial of the apprentice\r\nsystem to secure a supply of trained seamen for the Navy, the experience\r\nof all other countries is decidedly in favor of a liberal system of\r\nNavigation Schools, as well as an efficient system of registration,\r\nexamination, and certificates of competency and of service, administered\r\nunder national inspection and with pecuniary aid, and under the local\r\nmanagement of merchants, ship-owners, and underwriters, for the\r\ncommercial marine.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL REVIEW OF MILITARY EDUCATION\r\n\r\nI. NAVAL SCHOOLS AND EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nWe can not better introduce the conclusions to which this study of the\r\nsubject has brought us, than by giving a few extracts from the many\r\ncommunications, which the recent agitation of naval education in England\r\nhas elicited.\r\n\r\n_Proposed Improvements in Naval Education in England._\r\n\r\nIn 1869, the alternative was offered, on their own petition, to the\r\n2,710 disabled seamen, who resided in the truly magnificent Hospital at\r\nGreenwich, on the Thames, which the national gratitude had set apart for\r\ntheir accommodation, when no longer able from wounds, age, or other\r\ninfirmities to serve under “the meteor flag” of England--to continue\r\nthere at the expense of the government, or draw their pensions and spend\r\nit in their own way, among their friends in their old homes, or wherever\r\nthey fancied; only 31 elected to remain--and these were too feeble to\r\nleave, or had outlived their friends. The old Hospital infirmary, a\r\nlarge detached building, was granted by the Admiralty to the Seamen’s\r\nHospital Society for the benefit of the mercantile marine; but the bulk\r\nof that immense pile--which is covered in by seven acres of roof, and\r\nwhose domes and colonnades were designed by Sir Christopher Wren, and\r\nerected at a cost, from first to last, of not less than a million\r\nsterling--full of historic associations as the birthplace of Queen\r\nElizabeth, and the residence of two dynasties of English kings, and the\r\ngreater Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell, and for two centuries the home\r\nof the British Navy--for nearly two years has stood vacant. The TIMES,\r\nin an editorial of September 13, 1871, renews a suggestion made at the\r\ntime the system of out pensions was under discussion, to continue its\r\nuse for the Navy.\r\n\r\n  It is almost two years since we hazarded the suggestion that it should\r\nbe converted into a Naval University. We used the term “University” in\r\nthe sense of a collective institution, embracing several separate\r\nColleges adapted to a similar purpose. We pointed out how inadequate in\r\nextent and in range of education is the present Royal Naval College at\r\nPortsmouth, the only institution we possess for supplying to Naval\r\nOfficers what is termed a “higher education.” We also reminded our\r\nreaders that the education of our Naval Cadets between the ages of 12\r\nand 14 is now carried on in a School-ship, which, from the nature of\r\nthings, must have many disadvantages in comparison with a building of\r\nample space on the brink of a great river and on the border of a Royal\r\nPark. We showed that there was already a great Charity-School in the\r\nrear of the Hospital, and supported by its funds, for the gratuitous\r\neducation of 800 children of poor sailors; and we reckoned that the\r\nHospital would still supply ample accommodation for a scheme, suggested\r\nto us on high authority, for furnishing at cost price to the children of\r\nseamen of all grades in the Navy and Commercial Marine, an education in\r\nEnglish, French, the elements of science, and the ordinary rudiments of\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\n  In the year 1870 the Admiralty appointed a committee on “the Higher\r\nEducation of Naval Officers,” and directed them to consider whether it\r\nwas desirable to limit the place of study to the College at Portsmouth,\r\nor whether the vacant buildings at Greenwich could be utilized for the\r\npurposes of education. The reported evidence of the Committee revealed a\r\nlamentable want of scientific knowledge in the naval profession. The\r\nwitnesses were agreed in stating that few half-pay Officers had\r\nknowledge enough to study with advantage after the age of 30, and that\r\nfew could, with advantage to the service and themselves, be spared to\r\nstudy before the age of 30. It was stated by the Mathematical Master\r\nthat Commanders and Captains come to the College very badly prepared,\r\nand that “some come who are unable to work a decimal fraction.” They\r\ncome, as the College is now organized, exclusively for scientific study,\r\nin which Mathematics are a necessity, and yet are destitute of the most\r\nelementary preparation. Of course there are a few brilliant exceptions,\r\nbut the scientific attainments of the profession as a body appear to be\r\ndeplorably low.\r\n\r\n  In preparing a scheme for the improvement of what is so modestly\r\ntermed “the higher education” of Naval Officers, the Committee proposed\r\nto add to the voluntary subjects of study a considerable number of\r\npractical pursuits. They proposed, under the advice of the late Chief\r\nConstructor of the Navy, to add both a short and a long course in Naval\r\nArchitecture, in which there is at present absolutely no instruction\r\ngiven to Naval Officers. Such an education was supplied between the\r\nyears 1806 and 1821, but since the latter year it has been altogether\r\nignored and discouraged. It would require considerable space for the\r\nexhibition of models, and no sufficient room exists for it in the\r\npresent College in Portsmouth Dockyard. The Committee proposed to\r\nfurnish instruction, as now, in Steam, Mathematics, Nautical Astronomy,\r\nand Field Fortification, but to add facilities for the study of\r\nLanguages, Chemistry, including Metallurgy, Geology, Mineralogy, and\r\nNaval Tactics. The want of a knowledge of languages in the British Navy\r\nwas signally illustrated on a somewhat recent occasion, when the French\r\niron-clad fleet visited Spithead, and upon our Admiral signalling for\r\nall officers who could speak French to come on board the Flagship, only\r\none officer in the Channel Fleet was able to respond to the summons. The\r\nwant of a scientific knowledge of the principles of naval architecture\r\nhas prevented of late many skilled seamen of the Royal Navy from\r\ncontributing useful and practicable suggestions to the discussions on\r\nour ironclad ship-building. The Committee seem to have thought that it\r\nwould not be practicable to make a year’s study in the Naval College in\r\npeace time compulsory for every sub-lieutenant, though distinguished\r\nofficers, like Admiral Sir Alexander Milne, gave evidence in favor of\r\nit. But, apart from this abundant source for supplying students, it was\r\nanticipated that an extension of the education would attract a large\r\nincrease of scholars; and on general grounds, quite distinct from the\r\naccommodation, one-half of the Committee, including the Director of\r\nNaval Education, were strongly in favor of establishing the College at\r\nGreenwich. Fortified by this concurrence of authority, we recommend\r\nagain to the consideration of the Government the scheme of a Naval\r\nUniversity as the best mode of repeopling that ancient and now vacant\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nThis “leader” of the Times was followed in the issue for Sept. 20, by a\r\ncommunication from the eminent ship-builder E. J. Reed, who was for\r\nseveral years at the head of the Department of Naval Construction--with\r\nreasons for immediately widening and raising the education of naval\r\nofficers of all classes.\r\n\r\n  The absence of everything like a comprehensive organization for\r\nimparting to them the knowledge necessary in these days is truly\r\ndeplorable, and is made the more so by the very fact that our officers\r\nare themselves well aware of the extreme defectiveness of their training\r\nin many branches of knowledge which would be most valuable to them, and\r\nexhibit the strongest desire to supplement that training by every\r\navailable means. I have had many occasions of observing this during the\r\nlast few years; not the least striking of them being the publication of\r\nmy book on _Shipbuilding in Iron and Steel_, which, although a purely\r\ntechnical and professional book, was eagerly procured and studied by a\r\nvery large number of naval officers, who, as you justly state, are now\r\nleft absolutely without any official instruction in naval architecture.\r\nWhen in Russia this year I found elaborate means and appliances for\r\ninstructing young officers in all the great features of practical\r\nshipbuilding, as well as in the general principles of naval design, and\r\nI had the opportunity of examining a large model of an iron-clad ship\r\nwhich was being constructed by these young naval officers; while the\r\nshipbuilding and engineering officers of the Russian service have one\r\nentire side of the vast building which accommodates the Admiralty\r\nbranches, wholly devoted to their instruction. I have not yet seen the\r\nnaval training schools of Germany, but I have had several opportunities\r\nof conferring on shipbuilding questions with the naval officers of that\r\ncountry, and I can state with perfect confidence that they possess a\r\nmost intimate acquaintance with even the latest methods of naval design\r\nand construction, and obviously have had a careful training in the\r\nprinciples of naval architecture and the details of shipbuilding. How\r\nmuch this training contributes to the efficiency of naval commanders and\r\nother officers I need not say.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed dwells on the total absence of even an attempt to instruct\r\nnaval officers of all ranks in the department of construction.\r\n\r\n  Even our warrant officers, the “carpenters” of the Navy, whose duty it\r\nis to keep our Navy in repair at sea, and to take instant measures for\r\nsaving our ships from the effects of injuries sustained by collisions,\r\ngroundings, or during action--even these officers are subjected to no\r\nspecial and organized training whatever, and are often put on board\r\nship, in responsible charge of the repairing staff, without any\r\nknowledge whatever of the construction of their vessel.\r\n\r\n  I knew so well that the whole class of naval “carpenters” have for\r\nyears been anxious to obtain a better training for their very\r\nresponsible duty, that I made a vigorous effort to be allowed to\r\norganize a system by which every carpenter of the service should be\r\ncarefully instructed in iron shipbuilding, and as carefully selected for\r\nparticular ships on account of his fitness for the duty; but some\r\ntradition about warrant officers being “executive officers,” and\r\ntherefore not under the Chief Constructor of the Navy, and also, I fear,\r\nsome jealousy of the patronage of such appointments passing into new\r\nhands, effectually barred my progress, and imposed conditions under\r\nwhich it was not possible to give effect to my wishes.\r\n\r\n  I do not think I shall go beyond the truth if I say that other warrant\r\nofficers are as deficient of suitable training as carpenters. I have\r\ncertainly known of more than one instance in which the machinery by\r\nwhich our great modern guns are worked at sea has been so imperfectly\r\nunderstood that the “breaks” which are intended to control them have\r\nbeen “greased;” and no doubt a war would develope sad consequences of\r\nthe enforced ignorance of our gunners.\r\n\r\n  But let it not be supposed that I advocate the instruction of warrant\r\nofficers alone in the principles and practice of shipbuilding; it is in\r\nmy judgment pressingly desirable that the whole class of executive\r\nofficers should be afforded a certain amount of training in these\r\nsubjects, and a far ampler training than they now receive in many other\r\nsubjects also. The Navy suffers very much, even in peace times, from the\r\nwant of a more liberal training on the part of its officers, as they\r\nthemselves well know; and I am thoroughly persuaded that in a time of\r\nwar we shall have to make great sacrifices on account of our neglect in\r\nthis respect. Many unwise things are done, and many unwise reports are\r\nwritten, because of the want of fuller scientific and technical\r\ninformation on the part of naval officers; and I do not hesitate to say\r\nthat during my tenure of the Chief Constructorship serious evils arose\r\nin my own department from the outside pressure of the uninformed.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed would locate the Naval University at Greenwich.\r\n\r\n  Such a University must almost of a necessity be metropolitan. All the\r\nprovincial Government Schools of Naval Architecture in this country have\r\nfailed, and always must fail, because the metropolis alone can supply\r\nthe necessary professors for class education chiefly of a scientific\r\ncharacter; and the same is even more true of the present case. All the\r\ncivil members of the late Admiralty Committee on the higher education of\r\nnaval officers concurred in this view, none more strongly, I believe,\r\nthan the present Director of Admiralty Education, Dr. Joseph Woolley,\r\nwho is undoubtedly at once the most experienced and most enlightened\r\nauthority alive as regards all questions of naval training. And there is\r\nthis very strong further reason for making this University\r\nmetropolitan--viz., that one of the most fruitful and valuable results\r\nto be anticipated from a more liberal and enlarged education of our\r\nnaval officers is the release of the service from those thousand and one\r\nOld World prejudices which cramp the action and spirit of the service in\r\nthese modern days, when other nations are bringing their most free and\r\ncultivated minds to bear upon naval warfare; and to found a University\r\nin a port where the present traditions and habits of thought of the\r\nservice have the greatest force, would be to place a fatal stumbling\r\nblock at the very threshold of the work; and if the metropolis is to be\r\nthe home of the University there can not be a doubt about the superior\r\neligibility of Greenwich. There the magnificent college already stands,\r\nwith its empty halls, inviting the Government to devote them to some\r\ngreat national and naval object. It is within easy reach of London,\r\nprofessors and teachers; it is in the neighborhood of great shipbuilding\r\nand marine engine-making establishments, and also of Chatham Dockyard.\r\nIt is on the banks of our noblest river, and on the verge of the open\r\ncountry, so that every form of healthful recreation would be available\r\nfor the students. It also affords ample internal space for all those\r\nlaboratories, model rooms, lecture rooms, and other apartments, which\r\ncould only be secured on a sufficient scale at a seaport by a large\r\noutlay of money. And, above all, it affords the readiest, as well as the\r\nbest, means of entering upon a much too long-neglected undertaking.\r\n\r\nIn the same issue (Sept. 20), the Times had a leader on the subject,\r\nfrom which we take a few paragraphs.\r\n\r\n  It is certainly discouraging for a nation which has hitherto held, and\r\nwhich means to keep, the first place in the world as a naval Power to\r\nfind that in systematic training Russia and Germany are dangerously\r\nsurpassing us. No doubt in the raw material of a navy we can compete\r\nfearlessly with any country on the face of the earth; our sailors can\r\nnot be matched for enterprise, resolution, and discipline, nor can our\r\ncaptains, in spite of some late disasters, be out-sailed or\r\nout-manœuvred by any who sail under foreign flags. But we must not\r\nforget that war on the seas, like war on land, is year by year becoming\r\nmore and more a scientific pursuit. Our magnificent iron-clad fleet, in\r\nwhich Mr. Reed feels justly a parental interest, is too precious a\r\npossession to be intrusted to men who do not know how to use so\r\ntwo-edged an instrument. But how should our naval officers know how to\r\nmanage an iron-clad ship? They are taught nothing about the construction\r\nof these triumphs of modern science; they do not, as a rule, possess\r\neven the elementary knowledge which would enable them to commence the\r\nstudy of the subject.\r\n\r\n  Whether the unequaled advantages offered by Greenwich Hospital be\r\nturned to account or some more expensive method be adopted by a\r\nGovernment which pins its credit on economy, the necessity of providing\r\nfor the education of naval officers can no longer be ignored. Not to\r\nspeak of the absolute absurdity of sending iron-clads to sea in charge\r\nof officers who know no more of the construction of an iron-clad than\r\nthey know of the latest improvements in cotton-spinning machinery, it is\r\nobvious that a system under which men whose business is to navigate\r\ncostly vessels of war, are sent to their work without knowing even the\r\nelements of mathematics, must sooner or later result in a disastrous\r\ncollapse. It may be a question whether such has not been the case\r\nalready,--whether the recent mischances in the conduct at sea of some of\r\nour finest vessels may not be traceable to the imperfect education of\r\nthe officers.\r\n\r\n  When other nations are giving their sailors scientific teaching, and\r\nwhen we are expending gigantic sums on the construction of a Navy which\r\nmust be handled in accordance with scientific principles, it appears\r\nabsurd, or worse, to allow the commanders and the officers of our\r\niron-clads to go to sea without the slightest guarantee for their\r\nknowledge of the peculiar conditions under which one of our modern\r\nmonster ships is to be managed. If an iron-clad happens, as we may\r\npresume, considering what has lately happened, is not impossible, to\r\nstrike upon a rock or otherwise seriously to damage herself at a\r\ndistance from home dockyards, the chances are that no one on board, from\r\nthe captain down to the carpenter, will know how to repair the damage.\r\n\r\nTo the urgent demand for more scientific knowledge of naval\r\nconstruction, Admiral Henry J. Rouse interposes a plea for more\r\nseamanship, discipline, and education afloat. In the Times for Sept. 28,\r\nthe bluff Admiral says, rather bluntly:\r\n\r\n  I was alive to the want of seamanship and to the neglect of a naval\r\neducation from the moment a midshipman left his school and was appointed\r\nto a steamer: but I always flattered myself there was one redeeming\r\npoint--namely--gunnery--in which the officers of the present day had a\r\nwonderful preëminence over the old school. How is the proposed college\r\nto ameliorate this state of things? Will it make the young officers\r\nengineers when on board ship? They are not allowed to interfere with the\r\nengineer, who is, in fact, the commanding officer. Will warrant\r\nofficers, carpenters, and gunners, be educated there? And in answer to\r\nMr. Reed relying upon the carpenter in the event of a ship grounding\r\n(not an uncommon occurrence), we look to the captain to lay out his\r\nanchors, lighten his ship and heave her off by purchase over purchase;\r\nwe do not consult the carpenter. Mr. Reed says,--“The men who will have\r\nto design for our Navy will never be free to design the best ships which\r\ncan be provided until an improved education of the whole naval service\r\nunbinds the hands of the _scientific servants_ of the Admiralty.”\r\n\r\n  Who are the scientific servants? Are the men who designed the\r\niron-bound monsters at the expense of half a million each; which have\r\nevery bad quality, which can neither sail, wear, nor stay better than a\r\ncoal barge, and which roll and pitch like maniacs owing to the weight of\r\ntheir armor, and which are certain to founder if called upon to face a\r\nvery heavy gale? Are the servants scientific who stow their ballast on\r\nempty cells, thereby preventing a ship righting herself if she heels\r\nover 33 deg. under canvas, and which makes her capsize keel uppermost,\r\naccording to the simple law of gravitation which impels the vacuum to\r\nthe surface? Was the servant scientific who reduced a ship’s ballast 300\r\ntons, and put a corresponding weight of iron on the upper works,\r\nboasting he had retained the same line of immersion without calculating\r\nthe loss of stability, and did not the Admiralty listen to him like\r\ncountrymen to a mountebank, and reward him with a grant of money?\r\n\r\n  If a Greenwich College could diminish the frightful excesses and\r\nexpenditure in the last eight years in the building department, for\r\nwhich the House of Commons demanded an investigation, which was\r\ncheckmated by sending a distinguished admiral to the Cape of Good Hope;\r\nif it could instruct the scientific servants in the mysteries of their\r\nvocation, and convert the simple landsmen in Charing-cross into naval\r\noracles; if it could make young officers seamen by inspiration, then I\r\nshould agree with Mr. Reed that a Greenwich College would be most\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n  As for the junior officers nothing but a sailing ship can educate a\r\nseaman. If a midshipman loses the precious years from 14 to 17 in a\r\nsteamer he will be too old and proud to learn his profession, and when\r\nlater in life he is sent to take command of a prize ship under canvas in\r\nwar time he will look very foolish in half a gale of wind.\r\n\r\n  If any man will take the trouble to think, he must be convinced that\r\nno ship of any size, no armor _clypei septemplicis_, no guns of 25 tons\r\ncan compete with an iron-cased steam ram of about 1,200 tons,\r\ninvulnerable, bomb-proof, which would put five feet of cold steel under\r\na ship’s water line going 14 miles per hour. We are now building\r\ngunboats to protect the coast. One of Mr. Drake’s steam rams of about\r\n300 tons, without a gun mounted, would destroy a dozen of them. In the\r\nnext naval action history will be repeated. Romans, Carthagenians, and\r\nagain the _naves rostratæ, alias_ the Steam Ram, will carry the day. It\r\nis wonderful that the Admiralty for the last twenty years have been\r\nbuilding their hogs in armor to defy shot and shell, ignoring the\r\nterrible attack of this superior power. It is never too late to mend. To\r\nsave enormous sums of money and a waste of coal we ought to pay off all\r\nour useless monsters, and during peace to commission small ships with\r\nauxiliary screws, never to burn a coal except in a case of necessity;\r\nand then, by keeping squadrons at sea, we might improve our discipline,\r\nour seamanship, and _esprit de corps_.\r\n\r\nThe letter of Admiral Rouse was accompanied by a leader in the Times of\r\nthe same date from which we take a few paragraphs.\r\n\r\n  The spirit of an English sailor of the old school, with his bluff,\r\noutspoken, uncompromising detestation of change, and his unfaltering\r\nbelief that all that has been was right, is something to wonder at and\r\neven admire, if we should not care to imitate it, in these days of\r\nperpetual motion. He has observed, as we all have, with shame and\r\nmisgiving, that while the cost of our vast ironclad vessels of war is\r\ngrowing yearly greater, the officers of the new generation who are to be\r\nintrusted with the handling of these expensive monsters are not\r\ncomparable for practical skill and shiftiness with those of Admiral\r\nRouse’s contemporaries who dominated the seas in sailing frigates in the\r\ndays before either steam or ship-armor was devised. In his perception of\r\nthe defects of our present system the Admiral does not stand alone; it\r\nis condemned by the ablest officers who are now in command of our\r\nfleets, by the eminent engineers who construct them--unfortunately, with\r\nstill more eloquent urgency by the voice of our recent naval annals. The\r\nmisadventures of the Captain, the Psyche, and the Agincourt, not to\r\nmention less serious mishaps, have startled us all, and the seamanship\r\nof the British Navy has come to be gravely questioned.\r\n\r\nLet us compare Admiral Rouse’s remedy with Mr. Reed’s.\r\n\r\n  The latter is dwelling on the custom of sending young boys to sea with\r\nnecessarily imperfect training, and of promoting them to the higher\r\ngrades, though in the meantime they have had no opportunities of\r\nscientific instruction. He asserts the consequence is that very few of\r\nthe officers who command our costly iron-clads at the present day know\r\nany thing of the construction or the qualities of those gigantic boating\r\nmasses. Admiral Rouse admits this fully, but he superadds a charge at\r\nleast as serious; he alleges that few or none of our modern naval\r\nofficers who spend the years of their apprenticeship to the sea on board\r\na steamer, and who “worship the boiler whenever they are in a scrape,”\r\ndo know or can know any thing of real seamanship. Mr. Reed says that the\r\nstudy of the principles of shipbuilding is unknown among the officers of\r\nour Navy, and that accordingly, few of them can handle an iron-clad.\r\nAdmiral Rouse says that the study of the winds and waves is neglected by\r\nthem, and that not many of them can sail a frigate. Mr. Reed demands a\r\nNaval University to teach officers the theory of navigation as applied\r\nto the vast masses of iron now afloat under our flag. Admiral Rouse\r\nwould get rid of these “useless monsters” altogether, would, during\r\npeace, commission small “ships with auxiliary screws,” and “never burn a\r\ncoal except in case of necessity.” Here we have the ancient and the\r\nmodern spirit in contrast and juxtaposition. The former, obstinate and\r\noften illogical, but with a certain rude and not unjustified faith in\r\npractice, deserves our respect, for it was this spirit which won us, in\r\nold times, our naval supremacy. The latter may be over-bold and\r\npresumptuously contemptuous of the past and all its belongings; but it\r\nis the spirit of progress, and on its guidance we have to depend for the\r\nmaintenance of the renown we achieved in the earlier and darker time.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of March, 1871, Capt. James G. Goodenough, R. N., read a\r\npaper before the Royal United Service Institute, on the Preliminary\r\nEducation of Naval Officers, from which we make extracts.\r\n\r\n  I should be guilty of an absurd and forced indifference to what is\r\npassing around me if I were not to say that an impression now exists\r\nvery generally in the service, that the views which finds most favor\r\nwith regard to the training of the officers of Her Majesty’s Navy is,\r\nthat the naval officer should be taught young; that he should be made to\r\ndevote himself to the details, and nothing but details of his profession\r\nfrom boyhood to youth, and from youth to middle age, and that somewhere\r\nbehind middle age and old age, he should be deemed to be warrant, and be\r\nthrown away a pensioner on the country’s gratitude, unfit even to have a\r\nvoice in the guidance of the affairs of the service to which he may have\r\nbeen an ornament. This impression is doing much harm in all directions.\r\n\r\n  It is weakening the desire for knowledge and self-improvement in naval\r\nofficers; it is tending to narrow and circumscribe the idea of\r\nresponsibility of a naval commander for all things coming within his\r\nken, and to lower his conception of his own position from that of a\r\nrepresentative of his country in all parts of the world, an agent of her\r\npolicy, and a guardian of her commerce, to that of being a mere\r\nexecuting tool, whose only argument is force.\r\n\r\n  The warning which I should give, and it contains the whole case, is\r\nthis,--that while all other circumstances of life at sea have changed\r\nconsiderably in the last thirty years, the preliminary training of our\r\nofficers has not changed in its main features. It is not merely that our\r\nmaterial, whether in ships or guns, steamships or canvas, has changed.\r\nIt is not only that our material has become far more complicated than of\r\nyore. If that alone were the case, the system of a former age might\r\nsupplant the wants of the day. No! the change whose bearing we have\r\nfailed to acknowledge, even though we may have perceived it, is this,\r\nthat while formerly the conduct of ships at sea, their discipline, and\r\nthe handling of their material generally, was based on the experience\r\nobtained in the practical individual lives from early years, and on an\r\nacquaintance with external phenomena and internal details, which were\r\nnot reduced to laws or elevated into systems; now, we do possess rules\r\nand laws, which greatly reduce the value, if they do not quite\r\nsupersede, the practical experience of a single life. In every one of\r\nthe varied practical duties of a sea officer, this is the case, whether\r\nin navigation or in discipline, in artillery or in manœuvring; and I say\r\nthat this constitutes the great change in a sea life to which we have\r\nmade no corresponding advance. I say that although those laws and\r\nsystems exist, we still continue to let the details which they include\r\nbe painfully and only practically acquired by experience, instead of\r\nmethodically teaching the principles on which they are based.\r\n\r\n  The principles on which I consider that that education should rest are\r\nthese: _First_, that a distinction should be made between the period of\r\neducation and that of special training. _Second_, that special training\r\nshould be the business of the Government, while education should be left\r\nto the care of the parents, at the ordinary schools of the country.\r\n_Third_, that the handling of ships’ sails and boats, and the principles\r\nof command should be methodically taught, instead of, as at present,\r\nbeing left to chance observations and the accidents of service.\r\n_Fourth_, that the young officers under training in schoolships should\r\nhave no command, except over each other, and should count no sea time;\r\nand that on entering the service afloat in sea-going ships, they should\r\nbecome at once, in some measure, responsible officers, though liable to\r\nfuture examinations, and to produce evidence of having done work after\r\nleaving the training-ships. _Fifth_, that in order to discourage\r\ncramming, all entrance examinations should be confined, as far as\r\npossible, to the subject of study at advanced public schools, and that\r\nevery candidate should be required to bring with him certificates of a\r\nyear’s good conduct from his last school.\r\n\r\n  I wish to see a distinction made between the education and the special\r\ntraining of naval officers. I do not pretend to give the precise age at\r\nwhich this distinction should be made. It will necessarily differ with\r\ndifferent boys, and I would therefore have a two years’ limit to the age\r\nof entry instead of one. My opinion is, that special training should\r\nbegin at from 14 to 16, and that it should be continued from that age\r\nfor three years; that is, from an average of 15 to an average of 18 in\r\nthe college and sea-going training ships.\r\n\r\n  I should wish young officers to proceed thence to the ordinary service\r\nafloat, and after two years’ service in a sea-going ship to be admitted\r\nto pass an examination for lieutenants.\r\n\r\n  The examination for entry, which under the system I propose, would be\r\nat the average age of 15, should take place in November of each year,\r\nand should be arranged, as far as possible, so as to comprise subjects\r\nwhich do not require special cramming, but are taught generally in our\r\npublic schools, omitting some, such as Greek, of which no further use or\r\nnotice would be made in their future career, and substituting French, or\r\nanother modern language in lieu.\r\n\r\n  The college would then open for the cadets on the 1st of February, and\r\nwhile indoor studies of navigation, nautical astronomy and modern\r\nlanguages occupied the mornings, the afternoons should be devoted to\r\npractical seamanship until the first of May, when they should embark in\r\na corvette, especially set apart for their instruction, until August.\r\n\r\n  During these four months they should perform every practical duty of\r\ntheir profession with their own hands, under instruction, with plenty of\r\ntime, and with patient, steady instructors, and at the end of their\r\ncruise, after an inspection by the governor of the college, they should\r\nstrip and clear their vessel before proceeding on a summer holiday.\r\n\r\n  During the cruise they should not only learn to take and work their\r\nown observations for the position of the ship by the ordinary known\r\nmethods, but should also study the pilotage of the coast of England,\r\nwhenever visited.\r\n\r\n  After the vacation they should again rig their vessel, and until the\r\nend of October should have instruction in rigging, masting, and so on,\r\nwhile the weather permitted, as well as continuing to exercise in boats.\r\nNovember and December being devoted to indoor studies and examination.\r\nThis would complete the first year of training.\r\n\r\n  The second year would begin as the first, with indoor studies in the\r\nmorning, the advanced seamanship class of the afternoon, alternating\r\nwith gunnery instruction classes until May, when the second class would\r\nembark in a steam corvette, and in addition to the study of seamanship,\r\nas in the first year, would join that of steam machinery. While the\r\ncruise of the first year would have been on board a sailing corvette,\r\nand on the south coast of England generally, that of the second year\r\nshould have been extended to the coasts of the United Kingdom and\r\nwestern coast of Europe; and while the sailing corvette should be manned\r\nby steady old seamen, and no attempt should be made at quickness of\r\nmanœuvre, the steam corvette for the second year should be manned by\r\nactive young trained able seamen, and all manœuvres should be performed\r\ntogether, as in actual practice in man-of-war, the young cadets under\r\ntraining working a mast.\r\n\r\n  At the end of this cruise, they would not only strip their vessel, but\r\nwould also take to pieces the principal parts of the machinery, before\r\nthe summer holidays and after inspection.\r\n\r\n  On recommencement of term in October, indoor studies should again be\r\ntaken up, and the final examination for the rank of midshipmen should\r\ntake place in December, the average age of the young officers being now\r\n17 years.\r\n\r\n  I should now reassemble the midshipmen on February 1st, either on\r\nboard the gunnery ships or in a special ship attached to the college,\r\nfor a three months’ course in practical gunnery, after being examined in\r\nwhich, they should be discharged into a full-rigged, full-manned frigate\r\nfor final instruction in the duties of an officer, under selected\r\ncaptains, commanders, and lieutenants. They should here alternately take\r\nthe duties of officers of tops, officers of boats, officers in charge of\r\na particular mast, and in rotation as officers of the watch, under the\r\ncare and guidance of a lieutenant of each watch, while lectures and\r\nexercise in manœuvres of ships and boats, of heavy and field guns, of\r\nsmall-arm drills and landing parties, should be systematically taught\r\nthem. At the end of this cruise, which should extend to the\r\nMediterranean, an examination in seamanship should take place, and the\r\nmidshipmen would be discharged into the service afloat, at an average\r\nage of 18 years, where they would serve as midshipmen for one year\r\nbefore examination (as now) for sub-lieutenants.\r\n\r\n  Thus, the whole course of training would be two years at college, and\r\nin training corvettes as cadets, and one year’s training in practical\r\ngunnery, and instruction as an officer in various duties, with the rank\r\nof midshipman performing all the duties of a subordinate officer, at the\r\nconclusion of which an examination should take place in all the subjects\r\nof the profession, whether at home or abroad. This preliminary education\r\nshould be followed by the modification of the navigating class, the\r\ncreation of an examination for the rank of lieutenant, and other changes\r\nin rank.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Errata for Part X (United States):\r\n  _Arkansas_--484,167,--78 companies of State Guard,\r\n    --484,167--\r\n  was followed by the appointment of many persons from civil life\r\n    apointment\r\n  till after the war of 1812-’15 proved his ideas to be correct\r\n    1812--’15\r\n  1 Sergeant Major, / 1 Quartermaster Sergeant.\r\n    Sergeant,\r\n  VIII.
