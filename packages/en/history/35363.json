It is\r\nan attempt to give a correct impression of Italian history as a whole,\r\nand employs details only here and there, and then merely for the sake of\r\ngiving greater clearness to the general outline. So brief a narrative is\r\nmainly a work of selection; and perhaps no two persons would agree upon\r\nwhat to put in and what to leave out. I have laid emphasis upon the\r\nmatters of greatest general interest, the Papacy, the Renaissance, and\r\nthe Risorgimento; and my special object has been to put in high relief\r\nthose achievements which make Italy so charming and so interesting to\r\nthe world, and to give what space was possible to the great men to whom\r\nthese achievements are due.\r\n\r\n H.

D.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 476 an unfortunate young man, mocked with the great names of\r\nthe founders of the City and of the Empire, Romulus Augustus, nicknamed\r\nAugustulus, was deposed from the throne of the Caesars by a Barbarian\r\ngeneral in the Imperial service, and the Roman Empire in Italy came to\r\nits end. This act was but the outward sign that the power of Italy was\r\nutterly gone, and that in the West at least the Barbarians were\r\nindisputably conquerors in the long struggle which they had carried on\r\nfor centuries with the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThat Empire, at the period of its greatness, embraced all the countries\r\naround the Mediterranean Sea; it was the political embodiment of the\r\nMediterranean civilization. In Europe, to the northeast, it reached as\r\nfar as the Rhine and the Danube; it included England. Beyond the Rhine\r\nand the Danube dwelt the Barbarians. Europe was thus divided into two\r\nparts, the civilized and the Barbarian: one, a great Latin empire which\r\nrested upon slavery, and was governed by a highly centralized\r\nbureaucracy; the other, a collection of tribes of Teutonic blood, bound\r\ntogether in a very simple form of society, and essentially democratic in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe Empire, composed of many races, Etruscan, Ligurian, Iberian, Celtic,\r\nBasque, Greek, Egyptian, and divers others, had been created and\r\nmaintained by the military and administrative genius of Rome. Over all\r\nthese people Roman law and Roman order prevailed. All enjoyed the _Pax\r\nRomana_. From Cadiz to Milan, from Milan to Byzantium, from Byzantium to\r\nPalmyra, stretched the great Roman roads. Coins, weights, and measures\r\nwere everywhere the same. The inhabitants of Africa, Asia, and Europe,\r\nenfranchised by an Imperial edict, were thankful to be Roman citizens.\r\nTo this day Roman law, the Romance languages, and the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch testify to the vigour and solidity of Roman dominion. The city of\r\nRome was, and had been for centuries, the head of the world. From east\r\nand west, from north and south, booty, spoils, taxes, tribute had flowed\r\ninto Rome. Even after the seat of government had been removed to\r\nConstantinople (A. D. 330), visitors from the new capital were\r\nastounded to behold the Roman temples, baths, amphitheatres, forums,\r\ncircuses, and palaces, all glittering with marble and bronze. But the\r\nriches acquired by conquest and tribute had brought seeds of evil with\r\nthem. Society was divided into the very rich and the very poor; the\r\nsimple laborious life of the freemen of ancient Rome was gone; the\r\nregular occupations of production had been abandoned to serfs and\r\nslaves; moderate incomes and plain living had disappeared. The middle\r\nclass had been thrust down to the level of the plebs. In the country the\r\nsmall proprietors had been reduced to a position little better than\r\nthat of the serfs, while the great landlords had got vast tracts of land\r\ninto their hands. Nearly half the population were slaves. Taxes had\r\nbecome heavier and heavier as the exigencies of the Empire grew; great\r\nnumbers of officials were maintained, and great mercenary armies. The\r\nrich controlled the government, and shifted almost the whole burden of\r\ntaxation from their own shoulders to those of the poor. In the cities,\r\neach imitating Rome so far as it could, had grown up a vicious\r\nunemployed class, living on the distribution of bread which was paid for\r\nout of the public revenues.\r\n\r\nOn the farther side of the Rhine and the Danube, in marked contrast with\r\nthis society, the Teutonic Barbarians tilled their lands and herded\r\ntheir flocks. They dwelt in little communities which were banded\r\ntogether into tribes; and these in turn were united in a sort of loose\r\nconfederation, which assumed the semblance of a nation only when under\r\nthe necessity of military action, and then the adult male population\r\nconstituted the army. Their buildings were of the humblest character,\r\ntheir clothes rude, their arts primitive; they could neither read nor\r\nwrite, and their men cared for little besides hunting and fighting. They\r\nwere, however, a free, self-respecting, self-governing people, electing\r\ntheir king, and meeting in one great assembly to enact their laws. On\r\nthe Roman borders the Barbarians had become Christians, unfortunately\r\nnot Trinitarians, but mere Arians, heretics in the eyes of the orthodox\r\nCatholics; so their Christianity hardly served to smooth their relations\r\nwith the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe differences between these two divisions of Europe were about as\r\ngreat as between ourselves and the Don Cossacks. A Roman gentleman\r\nliving in Gaul, for example, would have a villa in Auvergne, built high\r\nupon the hills in order to get the breezes and the view. Here was a\r\nbath-house, a fish-pond, separate apartments for the women, a pillared\r\nportico that overlooked a lake, a winter drawing-room, a summer parlour,\r\netc. In this agreeable place, in his times of leisure, the owner would\r\nstroll about his grounds, play tennis, cultivate his garden, read Virgil\r\nand Claudian, compose epigrams, write letters to his friends in the vein\r\nof Horace's Satires, gossip about the doings at the Imperial court or\r\ntalk philosophy. The pleasant, luxurious life of Roman gentlemen was not\r\nvery different from luxurious life in America to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Barbarians in their native forests were hardly aware of Roman\r\ncivilization; and those on the border made a marked contrast with the\r\nRomans. The young kings were superb athletes, sparing at table, and\r\nattentive to their kingly duties. The Barbarian elders admired Roman\r\ncivilization, but were \"stiff and lumpish in body and mind.\" The young\r\nmen, six feet or more in height, with long, yellow hair, were great\r\neaters of garlic and indelicate viands; they went about bare-legged,\r\nbooted with rough ox-leather, and wore short-sleeved garments of divers\r\ncolours, belted tight, with swords dangling at their backs, shields at\r\nside, and battle-axes in their hands.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake, however, to draw a very sharp line between these\r\ntwo opposing divisions of Europe. The Teutons were called Barbarians\r\nbecause they were not Romans, but many of them had been trained in the\r\nRoman armies and had lived in Constantinople, Trier, or Milan, and were\r\nwell accustomed to Roman military arts and discipline; in fact, the\r\nRoman army was recruited mainly from among the Barbarians. Roman traders\r\ndealt with them regularly. In one way and another the Barbarians,\r\nespecially their leaders, had come under the educating influence of\r\nRoman civilization, and they regarded that civilization with an\r\namazement and a respect that at times deepened into awe.\r\n\r\nBut though a sharp line cannot be drawn, yet at bottom Romans and\r\nBarbarians were far apart. It was impossible that two societies of such\r\ndivergent civilization should exist side by side in peace; one must\r\nconquer the other. The struggle between the Empire and its enemies had\r\nbeen almost continuous since the days of Julius Caesar, and for several\r\ncenturies the Empire had prevailed; but social disintegration within had\r\nproceeded rapidly, and by the beginning of the fifth century the\r\nEmpire's doom had come. Rome herself, the original home of empire, lay\r\n\"nerveless, dead, unsceptred,\" open to any takers; and takers came. The\r\nVisigoths, under Alaric, captured the city in 410 and were merciful; the\r\nVandals, under Genseric, captured it in 455 and were cruel.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Rome, which we now see to have been inevitable, came,\r\nhowever, with a terrible shock to the civilized world. St. Jerome, who\r\nhad gone to the wilderness near Bethlehem in order to meditate upon the\r\nprophets, wrote: \"My voice is choked and my sobs interrupt the words\r\nwhich I write; the city is subdued which subdued the world.... Who could\r\nbelieve that Rome, which was built of the spoils of the whole earth,\r\nwould fall, that the city could, at the same time, be the cradle and\r\ngrave of her people; that all the coasts of Asia, Egypt, and Africa\r\nshould be filled with the slaves and maidens of Rome? That holy\r\nBethlehem should daily receive, as beggars, men and women who formerly\r\nwere conspicuous for their wealth and luxury?\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe city of Rome had been deemed immortal; it had become almost sacred\r\nfrom long veneration; and when Rome fell, the Empire in the West had not\r\na prop to rest upon. Spain was taken by the Suevi and the Visigoths,\r\nGaul by the Franks, Burgundians, and Alemanni, England by Angles and\r\nSaxons, Africa by the Vandals; and, with the deposition of Romulus\r\nAugustulus, Italy, too, became the prize of a Barbarian general.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding period of European history, in Gaul, Spain, Africa, and\r\nItaly, is the mingling or attempted mingling of the old populations of\r\nthe Empire with the Barbarian conquerors. The process had, indeed, as I\r\nhave intimated, begun before the fall of the Empire. For several\r\ngenerations Barbarians had not only been received as colonists and taken\r\nas soldiers, but even whole tribes had been admitted within the Roman\r\nboundaries. Imperial statesmen had realized that the Empire could only\r\nbe upheld by an infusion of Barbarian virility, and they had favoured\r\nthe process. But assimilation had not taken place, and now that the\r\nEmpire had passed into the hands of the Barbarians there were two social\r\nstrata,--the rude martial conquerors on top, and the civilized, feeble,\r\nsubject race, ten times as numerous, underneath. It was obvious to the\r\nwiser Barbarian chiefs, trained as they were in Roman ways, that if they\r\nwere to get stable dominion and civilized government, they must adopt\r\nthe complicated Imperial machinery. They saw that unless the Barbarians\r\nlearned Roman civilization, they would need hundreds of years to create\r\nany such civilization of their own. This was especially true in Italy.\r\nOdoacer, the general who deposed Romulus Augustulus, well knew that a\r\nstate which had its military service all Barbarian and its civil service\r\nall Roman could not stand firm. Barbarian sovereignty needed support,\r\nespecially legal support, in the eyes of the subject population. Such\r\nlegitimacy could only come from the Empire. Odoacer and other\r\nintelligent Barbarians turned instinctively to Constantinople for\r\nrecognition. They did not think that they had overturned or suppressed\r\nthe Empire. Nobody thought that there were two Empires, one Eastern and\r\none Western, one enduring and one destroyed in 476. To the Roman world\r\nthe Empire had always been single, had always been a unit. The division\r\ninto eastern and western parts had been made for convenience of\r\nadministration; the Empire itself had never been divided. Even after the\r\nwestern countries of Europe had been overrun by the Barbarians, the\r\nEmperor at Constantinople remained the supreme and sole source of\r\nauthority and law. The very Barbarians could not free themselves from\r\nthis theory, however little heed they paid to it in practice. Odoacer\r\nacknowledged the sovereignty of the Empire without question. He merely\r\nwished to control the civil and military administration in Italy.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning a sketch of the attempts to found a permanent Barbarian\r\ngovernment in Italy and to combine Barbarians and Romans in one people,\r\nit is necessary to speak of a rising power which already constituted the\r\nmost important element in the situation. The Church was not only the one\r\nvigorous body in Italy, but it had already begun to foreshadow its\r\nfuture greatness. In the time of Constantine (323-337) and his immediate\r\nsuccessors, the bishops of Rome had no primacy over other bishops, but\r\nthey had claims to precedence, which they soon put to good use. Their\r\ncity was the cradle and home of Roman dominion. St. Paul had lived and\r\ndied there. Above all, as was universally acknowledged, the apostle\r\nPeter had founded their bishopric. Theirs, in an especial sense, was the\r\nChurch to which Christ referred when He said to the apostle, \"Thou art\r\nPeter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell\r\nshall not prevail against it.\" The bishops of Rome also derived immense\r\nadvantage from the absence of a temporal prince; whereas their chief\r\nrivals, the patriarchs of Constantinople, were wholly eclipsed by the\r\npresence of the Emperor. The removal of the great offices of government\r\nto Constantinople and the absence of any real civil life, had left Rome\r\neven then a mere ecclesiastical city, and the head of the Church became\r\nthe most important personage there. It was so generally acknowledged\r\nthat Roman bishops were entitled to that precedence in rank over other\r\nbishops, which Rome enjoyed over other cities, that in 344 an Ecumenical\r\nCouncil submitted a most important question to the decision of the Roman\r\nSee. One hundred years later the great pope, Leo I, merely gave\r\nutterance to the general opinion when he said: \"St. Peter and St. Paul\r\nare the Romulus and Remus of the new Rome, as much superior to the old\r\nas truth is to error. If ancient Rome was at the head of the pagan\r\nworld, St. Peter, prince of the Apostles, came to teach in the new Rome,\r\nso that from her the light of Christianity should be shed over the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nThe Roman Church gathered to herself whatever remained of the\r\nadministrative ability of ancient Rome. With acute practical sense she\r\ncondemned those subtle doctrines that kept springing up in the East,\r\nlate flashes of Greek metaphysics; and though she may have cut herself\r\noff from certain spiritual Neoplatonic thought, and have set her heart\r\ntoo much upon domination, yet by her very adherence to dogma, by her\r\nvery insistence upon uniform law and obedience, by steadfastly\r\nmaintaining the purity and the unity of the Faith, she became the great\r\ncohesive force in Europe, and by creating Christendom contributed\r\nimmensely to the cause of European civilization. Partly by good fortune,\r\npartly by her success in making her cause prevail, Rome was always\r\northodox. She remained staunchly Trinitarian. She fought the Arians, who\r\nbelieved that the Son, created by the Father, could not be identical\r\nwith Him and could not have existed from the beginning. She fought the\r\nNestorians, who alleged that the Virgin was the mother of Christ only in\r\nso far as He was man. She fought the Monophysites, who denied that\r\nChrist had two distinct natures, human and divine. She fought always\r\ngallantly, and always, or almost always, in the end triumphantly. In\r\nthose days ecclesiastical affairs were inseparable from political\r\naffairs; no man dreamed of severing them either in fact or in theory;\r\nthe State and the Church were one fabric under a double aspect. The idea\r\nof the State apart from the Church, or the Church apart from the State,\r\nwas no more imagined than the Darwinian theory.\r\n\r\nIf we now go back to Odoacer, and to his Barbarian successors, we shall\r\nfind that in their endeavours to establish an Italian kingdom they were\r\nconfronted by a threefold task,--to blend the Barbarian conquerors and\r\nthe subject Latins, to establish friendly relations with the Empire, and\r\nto win the confidence and support of the Orthodox Church. In all the\r\nlong period of Barbarian dominion, each Barbarian chief in turn had to\r\nface the imminent danger that these three political powers, the subject\r\npeople, the Church, and the Empire, should make common cause against\r\nhim. The Barbarians, in fact, were always unsuccessful. They never were\r\nable to make Italy into one kingdom. These three enemies were too strong\r\nfor them. The inherent difficulties of the situation appear at once on\r\nthe deposition of Romulus Augustulus, and give whatever interest there\r\nis to Odoacer's brief career. Over that career, which bridges the years\r\n476 to 489, we need not pause, for Odoacer's attempt to establish a\r\npermanent government over all Italy was so ephemeral, and also so\r\nsimilar in all essential features to that of the Ostrogoths, his\r\nsuccessors, that an account of their attempt may serve for his as well.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Rome in the Middle Ages_, Gregorovius, vol. i, pp. 167, 168.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE OSTROGOTHS (489-553)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ostrogoths were a fine people; and historians have speculated sadly\r\non the immense advantage, the vast saving of ills, that would have\r\naccrued to Italy had they succeeded in their attempt to establish a\r\nkingdom. Such a union of strength and vigour with the gifted Italian\r\nnature might well have produced a happy result. But my business is\r\nmerely to indicate why and how the attempt failed.\r\n\r\nThe Ostrogoths (East Goths), one branch of the great Gothic nation, of\r\nwhich the Visigoths (West Goths) were the other, immediately prior to\r\ntheir invasion of Italy inhabited Pannonia (now Austria) on the south\r\nside of the Danube. They were a warlike people, and had given much\r\ntrouble to the Eastern Emperors, who had been obliged not only to bestow\r\nupon them territory, but also to pay tribute. The reigning Emperor\r\neagerly seized the first opportunity to rid himself of them. He\r\nsuggested to their king, Theodoric,--hunter, soldier, statesman, a\r\nbig-limbed, heroic man, passionate but just,--that he should lead his\r\npeople into Italy, conquer Odoacer, and rule as Imperial lieutenant. As\r\nItaly was far pleasanter than Pannonia, Theodoric gladly accepted the\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nThe Goths, not more than two or three hundred thousand persons all\r\ntold, effected their tedious emigration in 488-489. It was an easy\r\nmatter to defeat the unstable Odoacer, and the Latins made no\r\nresistance. Theodoric, now master of Italy, both by right of conquest\r\nand by Imperial commission, set himself, in his turn, to the task of\r\nuniting Barbarians and Romans throughout the peninsula under one stable\r\ngovernment. His difficulties were great. In the first place the\r\nimmigrating people whom he led, though mainly Goths, were a medley of\r\nvarious tribes, and constituted an alien army of occupation in the midst\r\nof an unfriendly population, perhaps ten times their number. This Roman\r\npopulation, which had completely given up the use of arms, and never\r\ntook part in any fight more formidable than a riot, was largely urban\r\nand lived in the cities which were scattered over Italy, almost the same\r\nthat exist to this day. In the north were Turin, Pavia, Ferrara, Milan,\r\nBergamo, Verona, Aquileia; on the east coast, Ravenna, Rimini, Ancona;\r\non the west coast and in the centre, Genoa, Pisa, Lucca, Perugia,\r\nSpoleto, Rome, Benevento, Naples, Salerno, Amalfi; and in the south, the\r\nold Greek cities. All the ordinary business of life was in Roman hands;\r\nlawyers, physicians, weavers, spinners, carpenters, masons, cobblers,\r\nwere Roman. Many of the workmen on great estates were also Roman. The\r\nGoths were primarily men-at-arms, and only exercised such rude crafts as\r\nwere required in village communities. The leaders became military\r\nlandowners. Naturally each race looked upon the other with suspicion,\r\ndislike, and contempt. It is obvious that there was need of both time\r\nand statesmanship before the two races would understand each other,\r\nshare occupations, inter-marry, and feel themselves countrymen.\r\n\r\nTheodoric's policy falls under three heads,--relations with the subject\r\npopulation, with the Emperor, and with the Church. With the Romans\r\nTheodoric was just and considerate; he limited the division of lands\r\namong his followers, so far as he could, to those lands which Odoacer's\r\nfollowers had had; he left civil administration chiefly in Roman hands;\r\nhe let Romans live under Roman law and Goths under Gothic law. He\r\nemployed as his chief counsellor Cassiodorus, a great Roman noble of\r\nwealth and learning; he issued a code compiled from the Imperial codes;\r\nhe reduced the taxation. Following the custom of the late Western\r\nEmperors, he dwelt in Ravenna, where _S. Apollinare Nuovo_, _S.\r\nSpirito_, a baptistery, and a mausoleum still testify to his presence.\r\nWhen the State had been put in order, Theodoric made a royal progress to\r\nRome (500), where he was welcomed with Imperial honours. He promised to\r\nuphold all the institutions established by Roman Emperors, and showed\r\nhimself as much interested in the city as if he had been a Roman. He\r\nprovided carefully for the preservation of all the monuments of\r\nantiquity, repaired the walls, the aqueducts, the _cloacae_, and drained\r\nthe Pontine Marshes. He spoke of Rome as \"the city which is indifferent\r\nto none, since she is foreign to none; the fruitful mother of eloquence,\r\nthe spacious temple of every virtue, comprising within herself all the\r\ncherished marvels of the universe, so that it may in truth be said, Rome\r\nis herself one great marvel.\"[2] He renewed the distribution of bread,\r\ncelebrated games in the circus, and treated the Senate with great\r\ndistinction. In fact, until his breach with the Church, which turned all\r\nthe orthodox population against him, he walked closely in the Imperial\r\nfootsteps and was very successful in his relations with the Latin\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nDealings with the Emperor were more difficult. Immediately after his\r\nvictory over Odoacer, Theodoric had asked the Emperor for the regalia\r\n(the crown jewels and Imperial vestments) of the West, which had been\r\nsent to Constantinople upon the deposition of Romulus Augustulus. This\r\nembassy had been at first fobbed off, but finally the regalia were sent\r\nhim in token of full recognition of his authority. In the mean time\r\nTheodoric's army without waiting for permission from the Emperor had\r\nproclaimed him king; and in practice Theodoric always acted as an\r\nindependent king. In theory, however, he accepted the inclusion of Italy\r\nin the Empire as a fundamental principle, and acknowledged that his\r\nposition was merely that of ruler of one of the Imperial provinces. The\r\nEmperors, compelled by impotence to acquiesce in Theodoric's lieutenancy\r\nof Italy, wished him in their hearts all possible bad luck, and bided\r\ntheir time to make trouble for him. But this ill will was concealed\r\nbeneath the surface, and for about thirty years his relations with the\r\nEmpire, with some interruptions, were amicable enough.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of Theodoric's relations with the Church, which were a\r\nmatter of politics, and had to be considered by him on general grounds\r\nof policy, it is necessary to speak of the relations between the Church\r\nand the Emperor, for the latter affected the former. There were always\r\ndifficulties, active or latent, between the Roman Church and the Empire.\r\nThere was jealousy between old Rome and new Constantinople. There was\r\nmisunderstanding between the Latin and Greek mind. There was friction\r\nbetween Papal and Imperial authority. These troubles will appear more\r\nclearly as we proceed. At this time it is only necessary to say that\r\nduring the first thirty years of Theodoric's reign, his period of\r\nsuccess and prosperity, there was discord between Pope and Emperor, a\r\nkind of schism. The Byzantine Emperors, often men of cultivation, living\r\nin the most civilized city of the world, interested themselves in\r\ntheology, and liked nothing better than to tinker with the Faith. To\r\nthis, also, they were pushed by political needs. Their subjects were\r\ndivided into the orthodox and the heterodox; and this diversity of\r\nbelief was always a menace to political unity. To heal the breach, the\r\nreigning Emperor devised a scheme of compromise, a _via media_, on which\r\nhe hoped all would unite. The Papacy, incensed by this trifling with\r\northodoxy, and by the assumption of an Imperial right to interfere in\r\nmatters of faith, denounced the compromise. A schism was the\r\nconsequence, which lasted until the reign of the Emperor Justin\r\n(518-527), when the crafty statesman who guided Justin's policy, his\r\nnephew, the famous Justinian, effected a reconciliation. For Justinian\r\nalready cherished an ambition to win back Italy for the Empire; and he\r\nknew that that could not be done without the support of the Papacy. In\r\n519 a papal embassy bearing the olive branch was warmly welcomed at\r\nConstantinople; both Emperor and nephew condemned the compromise and\r\naccepted the orthodox Catholic faith. Thus the breach was healed.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of this breach between Empire and Papacy, the Gothic\r\nking had managed his relations with the Church very prudently. Although\r\nan Arian (like all Barbarians except the Franks), he was exceedingly\r\njust to the Catholics. He carefully refrained from taking part in the\r\ndomestic affairs of the Church, until he was compelled to do so in the\r\ninterest of order. While in Rome he maintained a most correct attitude.\r\nBut though he acted with great moderation and only followed Imperial\r\nprecedents, the Church resented his interference. Do what Theodoric\r\nwould, the Papacy was his natural enemy. It felt instinctively that a\r\nking of Italy must always overshadow the Pope, just as at Constantinople\r\nthe Emperor eclipsed the Patriarch, and that only upon condition of\r\nkeeping Italy without a strong government within its borders could the\r\nChurch attain its full stature. The ecclesiastical power was already\r\ninimical to civil authority. The attitude of the Church toward Theodoric\r\npresaged the history of the Holy Roman Empire during the Middle Ages,\r\nand the kingdom of Italy in our day. Nevertheless, until the\r\nreconciliation of Emperor and Pope, Theodoric had no serious trouble.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 524 the crafty Justinian, strong in his complete\r\nreconciliation with the Papacy, felt the time ripe to set about the\r\nrecovery of the lost provinces of the West, and made the first hostile\r\nmove. Perhaps, however, it is unjust to assign a purely political motive\r\nto Justinian's action, for in his active Byzantine brain, policy,\r\ntheology, law, art, and ambition were curiously blended. An Imperial\r\nedict was issued, persecuting Arians in various ways, and in particular\r\ncommanding that all Arian churches throughout the Empire should be\r\nhanded over to Catholics. This action of course received the approval of\r\nthe Pope, and was most effective in alienating the Arian Goths from the\r\nCatholic Latins. Theodoric, who had been consistently tolerant to\r\nCatholics, was very angry and threatened to retaliate by suppressing the\r\nCatholic ritual throughout Italy. This threat threw the Papacy into\r\ncloser alliance with the Emperor, and aggrieved the Latin people. A new\r\ngeneration had grown up in peace and comparative prosperity under\r\nTheodoric's rule, and, forgetful that for these blessings it was\r\nindebted to the Goths, began to give free play to its Latin prejudices.\r\nThus the three natural enemies of Gothic rule gradually drew together:\r\nthe Empire, from desire to recover Italy; the Papacy, to be rid of a\r\nruler; and the Latins, out of national prejudice.\r\n\r\nIntrigues were started between Constantinople and some leading men in\r\nRome. How far the conspiracy went nobody knew. The king was in no mood\r\nto act judicially. Several senators were arrested on the charge of high\r\ntreason, tried before partial or irregular tribunals, and put to death.\r\nOf these senators the most famous was Boethius, who stands at the end\r\nof Roman civilization, as Dante stands at the beginning of modern\r\ncivilization. The long centuries between the two constitute the Middle\r\nAges. It is interesting to note that Dante in his desolation after the\r\ndeath of Beatrice took to console him the book which Boethius wrote in\r\nprison, the \"Consolations of Philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nBoethius came of the most distinguished family in Rome. He and both his\r\nsons had been consuls. He was a student of Plato, Aristotle, and of the\r\nNeoplatonists; he had translated treatises on mathematics from the\r\nGreek, and had written on philosophy and theology. He was an\r\nencyclopedia of knowledge; when a hydraulic watch was wanted, or an\r\nespecially magnificent sundial, or a test to detect counterfeit money,\r\nor a musician to be sent to a foreign potentate, he was the man to be\r\nconsulted. His \"Consolations of Philosophy,\" which had immense vogue all\r\nthrough the Middle Ages in every language, furnishes his apology, his\r\ncase against Theodoric, and gives the Latin view of the Barbarians. He\r\nsays: \"The hatred against me was incurred while I was in office, because\r\nI opposed the acts of oppression to which the Romans were subjected. The\r\ngreed of the Barbarians for the lands of the Romans, always unpunished,\r\ngrew greater day by day; they sought men's lives in order to get their\r\ngoods. How often have I protected and defended wretches from the\r\ninnumerable calumnies of the Barbarians who wished to devour them.\"[3]\r\nTo this Roman defence must be opposed the statement of a contemporary\r\nhistorian: \"Everything about the Barbarians, even the very smell of\r\nthem, was hateful to the Romans; nevertheless it often happened that\r\nthey, especially the poor, preferred the oppression of the Barbarians to\r\nthat of the Imperial officials. The rich Romans impose taxes but they do\r\nnot pay them; they make the poor pay them. And when peradventure the\r\ntaxes are diminished the relief goes not to the poor but to the rich; so\r\nthat, when it is a matter of paying it concerns the people, and when it\r\ncomes to the matter of reducing taxes it is as if the rich were the only\r\npersons taxed at all. Not Franks, Huns, Vandals, nor Goths behave so\r\nshamelessly.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of trials and executions Theodoric's anger and suspicion\r\nincreased; he compelled the Pope to go to Constantinople to ask that the\r\nArians be treated fairly and the Arian churches restored. The Pope\r\nreturned having obtained some favours for the Catholics, but nothing for\r\nthe Arians; whereupon Theodoric threw him into prison, and kept him\r\nthere till he died (526). He then nominated a successor, who was\r\npromptly elected by the frightened Romans. This high-handed action\r\nstimulated discontent so much that it seemed as if the time for a\r\nByzantine invasion had come, but Justinian, not having fully spun his\r\nweb, delayed. Perhaps he feared Theodoric and wished to wait for his\r\ndeath. He did not have to wait long. That summer Theodoric died, and\r\nwith him Italy's best hopes died too.\r\n\r\nWith Theodoric's death ended the possibility of a Gothic monarchy. Even\r\nin his reign a process of deterioration had set in among the young\r\ngeneration. The decadent civilization of Italy wrought with fatal effect\r\nupon the simple Goths; the luxurious ways, the idle habits, even the\r\nrefinements of the Latins, robbed them of their vigour and independence\r\nof character. The conquerors became divided among themselves; some\r\ninclined to the old Gothic traditions, some to the Latin ways. The royal\r\nhouse affords a conspicuous instance of this deterioration; the boy king\r\nsuccumbed to debauchery, his mother fell a victim to her Latin\r\nsympathies, and his cousin, last of the royal line, a student of\r\nliterature and philosophy, showed himself perfectly incapable of action\r\nand was deposed by his soldiers. Justinian, the spider, had been biding\r\nhis opportunity; now it had surely come. The Goths were disintegrated;\r\nthe Papacy and Latin people were with him; and his great general,\r\nBelisarius, fresh from the brilliant conquest of the Vandal kingdom in\r\nAfrica, was ready for the task. In 535 the war for the reconquest of\r\nItaly began.\r\n\r\nThe Goths were confused, divided, and without a leader, whereas\r\nBelisarius was a man of military genius, and his army was composed of\r\nveterans. The issue could not remain long in doubt. Naples, Rome, and\r\nfinally Ravenna, fell, and the reconquest would have been complete, but\r\nthat Justinian, jealous of a too successful general, recalled\r\nBelisarius. The Goths improved their respite, and their king, Totila, a\r\nvery valiant soldier, for a time retrieved their falling fortunes.\r\nJustinian, however, who had a remarkable knowledge of men, appointed\r\ngeneral-in-chief an extraordinary little old man, Narses, who, devoid of\r\nall military experience, had passed his life in the Imperial civil\r\nservice. Narses handled his men as if he had been born and bred in a\r\ncamp, and, after a comparatively brief campaign in which Totila was\r\nkilled, compelled the last remnant of the Gothic army to surrender\r\n(553).\r\n\r\nThus ended the first attempt to erect a Barbarian kingdom in Italy. Its\r\nfailure proved that without the support of the Catholic Church it was\r\nimpossible to establish a kingdom of Italy, for the Church controlled\r\nthe Latin people, and though these never fought, they had an hundred\r\nways of helping friends and hindering foes.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] _Rome in the Middle Ages_, Gregorovius, vol. i, p. 296.\r\n\r\n[3] _Le invasioni barbariche_, Villari, pp. 167, 168, translated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE LOMBARD INVASION (568)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Imperial dominion over all Italy had lasted scarce a dozen years\r\nbefore another Barbarian nation, the Lombards, came and repeated the\r\nexperiment in which the Goths had failed. The period of Lombard dominion\r\nlasted two hundred years (568-774). It is rather an uninteresting time;\r\nnevertheless, like most history, it has a dramatic side. It makes a play\r\nfor four characters. The Lombards occupy the larger part of the stage,\r\nbut the protagonist is the Papacy. The Empire is the third character.\r\nFinally, the Franks come in and dispossess the Lombards. The plot,\r\nthough it must spread over several chapters, is simple.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the play was pitiful. For nearly twenty years (535-553)\r\nItaly had been one perpetual battlefield; whichever side won, the\r\nunfortunate natives had to lodge and feed a foreign army, and endure all\r\nthe insolence of a brutal soldiery. Plague, pestilence, and famine\r\nfollowed. The ordinary business of life came to a stop. Houses,\r\nchurches, aqueducts went to ruin; roads were left unmended, rivers\r\nundiked. Great tracts of fertile land were abandoned. Cattle roamed\r\nwithout herdsmen, harvests withered up, grapes shrivelled on the vines.\r\nFrom lack of food came the pest. Mothers abandoned sick babies, sons\r\nleft their fathers' bodies unburied. The inhabitants of the cities fared\r\nno better. Rome, for instance, had been captured five times. Before the\r\nwar her population had been 250,000; at its close not one tenth was\r\nleft. It is said that in one period every living thing deserted the\r\ncity, and for forty days the ancient mistress of the world lay like a\r\ncity of the dead. With peace came some respite; but the frightful\r\nsqueeze of Byzantine taxation was as bad as Barbarian conquest. Italy\r\nsank into ignorance and misery. The Latin inhabitants hardly cared who\r\ntheir masters were. They never had spirit enough to take arms and fight,\r\nbut meekly bowed their heads. Such was the scene on which these three\r\ngreat actors, the Lombards, the Papacy, and the Empire, played their\r\nparts. It is now time to describe the actors. We give precedence to the\r\nEmpire, as is its due.\r\n\r\nThis remnant of the Roman Empire, with its capital on the confines of\r\nEurope and Asia, was an anomalous thing. It is a wonder that it\r\ncontinued to exist at all. In fact, there is no better evidence of the\r\nimmense solidity of Roman political organization than the prolonged life\r\nof the Eastern Empire. The countries under its sway, Thrace, Illyria,\r\nGreece, Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, had no bond to hold them\r\ntogether, except common submission to one central authority. By the end\r\nof the sixth century, the Roman Empire was really Greek. The Greek\r\nlanguage was spoken almost exclusively in Constantinople, Latin having\r\ndropped even from official use. Yet the Empire was still regarded as\r\nthe Roman Empire, and was looked up to by the young Barbarian kingdoms\r\nof Europe with the respect which they deemed due to the Empire of\r\nAugustus and Trajan. For instance, a king of the Franks addresses the\r\nEmperor thus: \"Glorious, pious, perpetual, renowned, triumphant Lord,\r\never Augustus, my father Maurice, Imperator,\" and is content to be\r\ncalled in return, \"Childipert, glorious man, king of the Franks.\" Yet it\r\nmust be remembered that Constantinople at this time was the chief city\r\nof Europe. Greek thought and Greek art lingered there. Justinian had\r\njust built St. Sophia. In fact, Constantinople continued for centuries\r\nto be the most civilized city in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial government was an autocracy; all the reins, civil,\r\nmilitary, ecclesiastical, were gathered into the hands of the Emperor.\r\nIts foreign policy was to repel its enemies, Persians to the east, Avars\r\nto the north, Arabs to the south; its domestic policy was to hold its\r\nprovinces together and to extort money. The Emperors, many of whom were\r\nable men, usually spent such time as could be spared from questions of\r\nnational defence and of finance in the study of theology, for at\r\nConstantinople the problems of government were in great measure\r\nreligious. Next to the actual physical needs of life, the main interest\r\nof the people was religion. A statesman who sought to preserve the\r\nEmpire whole, of necessity endeavoured to hold together its incohesive\r\nparts by means of religious unity. This political need of religious\r\nunity is the explanation, in the main, of the frequent theological\r\nedicts and enactments.\r\n\r\nThe Emperors governed Italy, after the reconquest, by an Imperial\r\nlieutenant, the Exarch, who resided at Ravenna, under a system of\r\nadministration preserved in mutilated form from times prior to the fall\r\nof Romulus Augustulus. An attempt was made to keep civil and military\r\naffairs separate, but the pressure of constant war threw all the power\r\ninto military hands. The peninsula, or such part of it as remained\r\nImperial after the Lombard invasion, was divided for administrative and\r\nmilitary purposes into dukedoms and counties, which were governed by\r\ndukes and generals. The Byzantine officials were usually Greeks, bred in\r\nConstantinople and trained in the Imperial system; they regarded\r\nthemselves as foreigners, and had neither the will nor the skill to be\r\nof use to Italy. Their public business was to raise money for the\r\nEmpire, their private business to raise money for themselves.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these oppressions the Latin people preferred the Greeks to\r\nthe Lombards, partly because of their common Greco-Roman civilization,\r\npartly because the Empire was still the Roman Empire; and this popular\r\nsupport stood the Empire in good stead in the long war which it waged\r\nwith the Lombards. The Latin people did not fight, but they gave food\r\nand information. The Empire, however, was ill prepared for a contest.\r\nThe recall of Narses removed from Italy the last bulwark against\r\nBarbarian invasion. The Imperial army was weak, cities were poorly\r\ngarrisoned, fortifications badly constructed; and, but for the control\r\nof the sea which enabled the Empire to hold the towns on the sea-coast,\r\nthe whole of Italy would have fallen, like a ripe apple, into the hands\r\nof the invaders. The Empire, in fact, was exhausted by the effort of\r\nreconquest and had neither moral nor material strength to spare from its\r\nhome needs.\r\n\r\nThe Lombards, if inferior in dignity to the Empire, played a far more\r\nactive part in this historic drama. They came originally from the\r\nmysterious North, and after wandering about eastern Europe had at last\r\nsettled near the Danube, where part of them were converted to Arian\r\nChristianity. Discontented with their habitation, and pressed by wilder\r\nBarbarians behind them, they were glad to take advantage of the\r\ndefenceless condition of Italy. They knew how pleasant a land it was,\r\nfor many of them had served as mercenaries under Narses. The whole\r\nnation, with a motley following from various tribes, amounted to about\r\ntwo or three hundred thousand persons. They crossed the Alps in 568.\r\n\r\nThere were many points of difference between these invaders and the\r\nGoths. The Lombards had had little intercourse with the Empire, and were\r\nfar less civilized than their predecessors, and far inferior in both\r\nmilitary and administrative capacity. Their leader, Alboin, cannot be\r\ncompared in any respect with Theodoric. Moreover, Theodoric came,\r\nnominally at least, as lieutenant of the Emperor, and affected to deem\r\nhis sovereignty the continuation of Imperial rule; whereas the Lombards\r\nregarded only the title of the sword and invariably fought the Empire as\r\nan enemy.\r\n\r\nThe invaders met little active resistance; if they had had control of\r\nthe sea, they would readily have conquered the whole peninsula. They\r\noverran the North and strips of territory down the centre within a few\r\nyears, and afterwards gradually spread little by little; but they never\r\nconquered the South, the duchy of Rome, or the Adriatic coast. For the\r\ngreater part of the two hundred years during which the Lombard dominion\r\nexisted, the map of Italy bore the following aspect: the Empire retained\r\nthe little peninsula of Istria; the long strip of coast from the\r\nlowlands of Venetia to Ancona, protected by its maritime cities,\r\nRavenna, Rimini, Pesaro, Sinigaglia; and the duchy of Rome, which spread\r\nalong the Tyrrhene shore from Civita Vecchia to Gaeta; Naples and\r\nAmalfi; the territories of the heel and toe; and also Sicily and\r\nSardinia. The boundaries were never fixed. Of the Lombard kingdom all\r\none need remember is that it was a loose confederation of three dozen\r\nduchies; and that of these duchies, Spoleto, a little north of Rome, and\r\nBenevento, a little northeast of Naples, were the most important, as\r\nwell as the most detached from the kingdom. In fact, these two were\r\nindependent duchies, and rarely if ever took commands from Pavia, the\r\nking's capital, except upon compulsion.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the invasion the Lombards were barbarians; and they did\r\nnot make rapid progress in civilization. Fond of their native ways, of\r\nhunting and brawling, they were loath to adopt the arts of peace, and\r\nleft most forms of craft and industry to the conquered Latins.\r\nNevertheless, it was impossible to avoid the consequences of daily\r\ncontact with a far more developed people, and their manners became more\r\ncivilized with each generation. The royal house affords an indication of\r\nthe change which was wrought during the two hundred years. Alboin, the\r\noriginal invader (died 573), killed another Barbarian king, married his\r\ndaughter, and forced her to drink from a cup made of her father's skull.\r\nThe last Lombard king, Desiderius (died about 780), cultivated the\r\nsociety of scholars, and his daughter learned by heart \"the golden\r\nmaxims of philosophy and the gems of poetry.\" Each advance of the\r\nLombards in civilization was a gain to the Latins, who, especially in\r\nthe country where they worked on farms, were little better than serfs.\r\nThe two races drew together slowly. The conversion of the Lombards from\r\nArian to Catholic Christianity (600-700) diminished the distance between\r\nthem. Intermarriage must soon have begun; but not until the conquest by\r\nthe Franks does there seem to have been any real blending of the races.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous trait in the Lombard character was political\r\nincompetence. It would have required but a little steadiness of purpose,\r\na little political foresight, a little spurt of energy, to conquer\r\nRavenna, Rome, Naples and the other cities held by the Byzantines, and\r\nmake Italy into one kingdom. Failure was due to the weakness of the\r\ncentral government, which was unable to weld the petty dukedoms\r\ntogether. This cutting up of Italy into many divisions left deep scars.\r\nEach city, with the territory immediately around it, began to regard\r\nitself as a separate state, with no sense of duty towards a common\r\ncountry; each cultivated individuality and jealousy of its neighbours,\r\nuntil these qualities, gradually growing during two hundred years,\r\npresented insuperable difficulties to the formation of an Italian\r\nnational kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their political incompetence the Lombards left their mark on\r\nItaly, especially on Lombardy and the regions occupied by the strong\r\nduchies of Spoleto and Benevento. For centuries Lombard blood appears in\r\nmen of vigorous character; and Lombard names, softened to suit Italian\r\nears, linger on among the nobility. In fact, the aristocracy of Italy\r\nfrom Milan to Naples was mainly Teutonic, and the principal element of\r\nthe Teutonic strain was Lombard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CHURCH (568-700)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne great political effect of the Lombard conquest was the opportunity\r\nwhich it gave the Papacy, while Lombard and Byzantine were buffeting\r\neach other, to grow strong and independent. Had Italy remained a Greek\r\nprovince the Pope would have been a mere provincial bishop, barely\r\ntaking ceremonial precedence of the metropolitans of Ravenna, Aquileia,\r\nand Milan; had Italy become a Lombard kingdom, the Pope would have been\r\na royal appointee; but with the Lombard kings fighting the Byzantine\r\nExarchs, each side needing papal aid and sometimes bidding for it, the\r\nPope was enabled to become master of the city and of the duchy of Rome,\r\nand the real head of the Latin people as well as of the Latin clergy. In\r\nfact, the growth of the Roman Catholic Church is the most interesting\r\ndevelopment in this period. The Lombards gave it the opportunity to grow\r\nstrong and independent, but the power to take advantage of the\r\nopportunity came from within. This power was compact of many elements,\r\nsecular and spiritual. From the ills of the world men betook themselves\r\nwith southern impulsiveness to things religious; they sought refuge,\r\norder, security in the Church. In the greater interests of life among\r\nthe Latins the rising ecclesiastical fabric had no competitor. Paganism\r\nhad vanished before Christianity, philosophy before theology.\r\nLiterature, art, science had perished. Italy had ceased to be a country.\r\nThe ancient Empire of Rome had faded into a far-away memory. The wreck\r\nof the old nobility left the ecclesiastical hierarchy without a rival.\r\nIn the midst of the general ruin of Roman civilization the Church stood\r\nstable, offering peace to the timid, comfort to the afflicted,\r\nrefinement to the gentle, a home to the homeless, a career to the\r\nambitious, power to the strong. By a hundred strings the Church drew men\r\nto her; in a hundred modes she sowed the prolific seeds of\r\necclesiastical patriotism. She was essentially Roman, and gathered to\r\nherself whatever was left of life and vigour in the Roman people. With a\r\nstructure and organization framed on the Imperial pattern, she slowly\r\nassumed in men's minds an Imperial image; and Rome, a provincial town\r\nwhose civil magistrates busied themselves with sewers and aqueducts,\r\nagain began to inspire men with a strange confidence in a new Imperial\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the strength derived from her immense moral and spiritual\r\nservices, the Church had the support of two potent forces, ignorance and\r\nsuperstition. The general break-up of the old order had lowered the\r\ncommon level of knowledge. Everybody was ignorant, everybody was\r\nsuperstitious. The laws of nature were wholly unknown. Every ill that\r\nhappened, whether a man tripped over his threshold, or a thunderbolt hit\r\nhis roof, was ascribed to diabolic agencies. The old pagan\r\npersonification of natural forces, without its poetry, was revived. The\r\nonly help lay in the priest, a kind of magical protector, who with\r\nbeads, relics, bones, incense, and incantation defended poor humanity\r\nfrom the assaults of devils. Thus, while all civil society suffered from\r\nignorance, while every individual suffered from the awful daily, hourly,\r\npresence of fear, the Church profited by both.\r\n\r\nBeside these intangible resources, the Church, or to speak more\r\nprecisely the Papacy, had others of a material kind. For centuries pious\r\nmen, especially when death drew near, had made great gifts of land to\r\nthe bishops of Rome, until these bishops had become the greatest landed\r\nproprietors in Italy. Most of their estates were in Sicily, but others\r\nwere scattered all over Italy, and even in Gaul, Illyria, Sardinia, and\r\nCorsica. In extent they covered as much as eighteen hundred square\r\nmiles, and yielded an enormous income. This income enabled the Popes to\r\nmaintain churches and monasteries, schools and missionaries, to buy off\r\nraiding armies of Lombards, and also to equip soldiers of their own.\r\nThese estates the Church owned as a mere private landlord. During the\r\nGothic dominion and the restoration of Imperial rule, she had no rights\r\nof sovereignty. But later on, during the disturbed period of border war\r\nbetween Lombards and Greeks, we find the Popes actually ruling the duchy\r\nof Rome.\r\n\r\nThe corner-stone of the great papal power, however, was laid by the\r\ngenius of one man, who organized the monastic sentiment of the sixth\r\ncentury and put it to the support of the Papacy. There had been monks in\r\nItaly long before St. Benedict (480-544), but as civil society\r\ndisintegrated, men in ever greater numbers fled from the world, and\r\nsought peace in solitude and in monastic communities. St. Benedict\r\nperceived that the monastic rules and customs derived from the East were\r\nill suited to the West; so he devised a monastic system, and formulated\r\nhis celebrated Rule, which became the pattern for all other monastic\r\nrules in Europe. He founded a monastery at Subiaco, a little village\r\nnear Rome, and afterwards the famous abbey on Monte Cassino, a high hill\r\nmidway between Rome and Naples, which became the mother of all\r\nBenedictine monasteries and shone like a light in the Dark Ages.\r\nBenedict's ideal was to help men shut themselves off from the\r\ntemptations of life and realize, as far as they could, the prayer \"Thy\r\nkingdom come ... on earth as it is in Heaven.\" He ordained community of\r\nproperty, and required a novitiate. Most strictly he forbade idleness,\r\nand with special insistence exhorted his brethren to till the ground\r\nwith their own hands. Intellectual interests followed; and Benedictine\r\nmonks became the teachers not only of agriculture, but of handicraft, of\r\nart and learning. His Order spread fast over Italy and Gaul, and in time\r\nover Spain, England, and Germany. Its communities, like the old _castra\r\nromana_, upheld the authority of Rome and enforced her dominion.\r\n\r\nThe attractions of the monastic life at Monte Cassino are well set out\r\nin a letter written (after St. Benedict's day) to one of the abbots, by\r\na man of the world who had once lived there: \"Though great spaces\r\nseparate me from your company, I am bound to you by a clinging\r\naffection that can never be loosed, nor are these short pages enough to\r\ntell you of the love that torments me all the time for you, for the\r\nsuperiors and for the brethren. So much so that when I think about those\r\nleisure days spent in holy duties, the pleasant rest in my cell, your\r\nsweet religious affection, and the blessed company of those soldiers of\r\nChrist, bent on holy worship, each brother setting a shining example of\r\na different virtue, and the gracious talks on the perfections of our\r\nheavenly home, I am overcome, all my strength goes, and I cannot keep\r\ntears from mingling with the sighs that burst from me. Here I go about\r\namong Catholics, men devoted to Christian worship; everybody receives me\r\nwell, everybody is kind to me from love of our father Benedict, and for\r\nthe sake of your merits; but compared with your monastery the palace is\r\na prison; compared with the quiet there this life is a tempest.\"[4]\r\n\r\nWhat Benedict did for the monastic orders, another great man, St.\r\nGregory (540-604), did for the Papacy itself. Gregory the Great, the\r\nmost commanding figure in the history of Europe between Theodoric and\r\nCharlemagne, was a Roman, made of the same stuff as Scipio and Cato, and\r\npresented the interesting character of a Christian and an antique Roman\r\ncombined. Born of a noble Roman family, Gregory was educated in Rome,\r\nand entered the service of the state, in which he rose to the high\r\noffice of prefect of the city; but, dissatisfied with civil life, he\r\nabandoned it and became a monk. He wanted to give himself up wholly to\r\na monastic life, but deemed it his duty to accept office in the papal\r\nservice, and filled the distinguished position of papal ambassador (to\r\nuse a modern term) at the Imperial court at Constantinople. In 590 he\r\nwas elected Pope, half against his will, for he desired to be either a\r\nmonk or a missionary; but he felt that the hopes of civilization and the\r\nfuture of religion lay in the Papacy, and he applied himself with energy\r\nto his new task. This task was as complex and multifarious as possible.\r\nIt concerned all Europe, from Sicily to England. Rome itself was in a\r\ndeplorable condition, left undefended by the Exarch, and threatened by\r\nthe Lombards of Spoleto, who harried the country to the very gates,\r\nmurdering some Romans and carrying others off as slaves. Gregory had to\r\ntake complete control of the city, military and civil. He wrote: \"I do\r\nnot know any more whether I now fill the office of priest or of temporal\r\nprince; I must look to our defence and everything else. I am paymaster\r\nof the soldiers.\" He kept up the courage of the Romans, and tried to\r\ndraw spiritual good out of their plight. It was impossible for a\r\ncontemporary eye to see that under present wretchedness lay germinating\r\nthe seeds of empire; yet Gregory acted as if he beheld them. In spite of\r\napprehensions of the end of the world he organized the Church to endure\r\nfor centuries. Both at home and abroad he displayed a tireless activity.\r\n\r\nAmong the foreign events of his pontificate are the conversion of\r\nEngland by Augustine (597) and the ministry of St. Columbanus (543-615)\r\namong the Franks, Alemanni, and Lombards. It was Gregory who saw the\r\nhandsome fairhaired boys from England standing in the market-place and\r\nsaid, \"Non Angli sed angeli.\" He had the true imperial instinct, and\r\nalways encouraged the clergy in distant parts of Europe to visit Rome\r\nand to apply to Rome for counsel and aid. The respect in which he was\r\nheld may be inferred from the titles given him by Columbanus: \"To the\r\nholy lord and father in Christ, the most comely ornament of the Roman\r\nChurch, the most august flower, so to speak, of all this languishing\r\nEurope, the illustrious overseer, to him who is skilled to inquire into\r\nthe theory of the Divine causality, I, a mean dove (Columbanus), send\r\nGreeting in Christ.\" Gregory also maintained close relations with the\r\nclergy in Africa, and received homage from the Spanish bishops, for\r\nSpain had recently been converted from Arianism to Catholicism. He was\r\nby no means content to confine his dealings to the clergy, but was in\r\nfrequent correspondence with kings and queens of western Europe, as well\r\nas with the Emperor and Empress in Constantinople. His immense energy\r\nmade itself felt everywhere. He made rules for the liturgy; and mass is\r\nstill celebrated partly according to his directions. He reformed church\r\nmusic and founded schools for the Gregorian chant. He administered the\r\npapal revenues, superintending the management of farms, stables, and\r\norchards. He founded monasteries, he supported hospitals and asylums.\r\n\r\nBenedict and Gregory are the two great figures of this period, and,\r\nthough no worthy successor followed for several generations, they did\r\ntheir work so well that the Papacy, like a great growing oak, continued\r\nto spread its power conspicuously in the eyes of the world, and also,\r\nout of sight, in the hearts and habits of men.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the Papacy and the Empire were difficult. The\r\nPopes were subjects of the Emperor. The whole ecclesiastical\r\norganization throughout the Empire was subject to the Imperial will,\r\njust as the civil or military service was. The Papacy did not like this\r\nposition of subordination and resented any interference in papal\r\naffairs. Though Odoacer, Theodoric, and Justinian had always asserted\r\ntheir right to exercise a supervision over papal elections, the Popes\r\nhad never acquiesced willingly, and even in those early days showed a\r\nmarked disposition to take exclusive control of what they deemed their\r\nown affairs. It might be supposed that the Papacy, mindful of the great\r\ndanger of a Lombard conquest of Rome, would have clung to the Empire;\r\nbut after the Lombards had become Catholics the gap between the Romans\r\nand the Greco-Oriental Empire was nearly as wide as that between them\r\nand the Lombards. There was a fundamental difference between the Greek\r\nmind, floating over metaphysics and speculative theology, and the Roman\r\nmind, bound to political conceptions and practical ends. A theology\r\nwhich would satisfy a congregation in St. Sophia would not suit the\r\nworshippers in St. Peter's. The Empire, obliged to adapt theological\r\nniceties to political necessities, favoured any creed of compromise,\r\nwhich should promote political concord and unity. Rome, with its\r\ndespotic, imperial instincts, felt that orthodoxy was its strength, and\r\nmaintained an inflexible creed. The two were an ill-yoked pair, and\r\nquarrels were inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the Papacy and the Lombards were more simple. They\r\nvaried between war, and friendship real or feigned. In the beginning,\r\nand even, as we have seen, in Gregory's time, there was war; but then\r\nbegan the conversion of the Lombards to Christianity, and intervals of\r\npeace followed, during which the Lombard king saluted the Pope as \"Most\r\nHoly Father,\" and the Pope replied \"My well-beloved Son.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] _Le cronache italiane del medio evo descritte_, Ugo Balzani\r\n(translated).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF THE FRANKS (726-768)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the separation of the Latin world from the Greek world in\r\nboth political and ecclesiastical affairs, and to the reconstruction of\r\nEurope by the alliance of the Franks and the Papacy. The plot continues\r\nto be very simple. The Empire, pressed by dangerous enemies, tried once\r\nmore to gain political strength by ecclesiastical legislation; the\r\neffect of this legislation on the Imperial provinces in Italy was to\r\ncause rebellion. The Papacy broke the ties that bound it to the Empire;\r\nthen, finding itself defenceless before the Lombards, made an alliance\r\nwith the Franks, who invaded Italy and overthrew the Lombards.\r\n\r\nIn order to elaborate this plot, we must begin with the great Asiatic\r\nmovement of the seventh century; for this movement acted as a cause of\r\ncauses to split the Latins from the Greeks, to exalt the Papacy, and to\r\nform the Holy Roman Empire. In one of the tribes of Arabia, without\r\nheralding, appeared a man, who at the age of forty became a religious\r\nprophet, and by the force of genius constructed one of the great\r\nreligions of the world. Mohammed's religion worked on the ardent Arabian\r\ntemperament like magic, and engendered a fierce passion for conquest and\r\nproselytizing. Tribes cohered, became both a sect and a nation, and\r\nswept like wildfire over the west of Asia and the north of Africa.\r\nMohammed died in 632, but his successors, the Caliphs, carried on his\r\nwork; under the inspiration of the slogan, \"Before you is Paradise,\r\nbehind you the devil and the fire of hell,\" they advanced from conquest\r\nto conquest. Cities and provinces were torn from the Empire. Damascus,\r\nSyria, Jerusalem, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Egypt, Rhodes fell in rapid\r\nsuccession; next Africa, bit by bit. Persia was beaten to her knees.\r\nSicily was raided. Twice Constantinople had to fight for life.\r\n\r\nNaturally Byzantine statesmen felt that some radical step must be taken,\r\nor all the remnants of the Empire would be reduced to slavery. A\r\nvigorous Emperor, Leo the Isaurian (717-741), took the radical step. It\r\nwas necessarily religious, for, in Constantinople, political action\r\nalways took a religious complexion. Leo issued a decree forbidding the\r\nuse of images in churches and in Christian worship (726). Those in place\r\nhe ordered broken. He acted no doubt from high motives, thinking to\r\nennoble religion and to arouse patriotism; but his people disagreed with\r\nhim. In the East riots and civil war broke out. These were suppressed,\r\nbut discontent and persistent opposition remained. In Italy also the\r\nexcitement was intense. The country had already been irritated by severe\r\ntaxation, and when the decree of iconoclasm was published, the\r\nimage-loving Italians rose in a body. The Pope, as most hurt in\r\nconscience by the decree, and in pocket by the taxation, was the natural\r\nhead of resistance. The Exarch attempted to arrest him, but both Latins\r\nand Lombards rallied to his defence. In some places open revolt broke\r\nout, and a plot was started to set up another Emperor in place of the\r\nwicked iconoclast who polluted the Imperial throne. But the Pope,\r\nGregory II (715-731), was a prudent man, and was not ready to take a\r\nstep which would deprive Rome of its single defence from the Lombards.\r\nHe opposed the rebellious plan, but in the matter of maintaining the\r\nimages he stood like a rock. His successor, Gregory III (731-741), went\r\nfarther, and took decisive action. He convoked a synod, which expelled\r\nevery image-breaker from the Church (731). This was tantamount to a\r\ndirect excommunication of the Emperor, and a declaration of papal\r\nindependence. The Emperor was powerless to compel obedience. Thus began\r\nthe great split between the Papacy and the Byzantine Empire, between\r\nwestern and eastern Europe, between the Latin Church and the Greek. Some\r\nof the western provinces, Calabria, Sicily, and Illyria, which were\r\npractically Greek, remained faithful to the Empire and shared its\r\nfortunes for several hundred years more. Ecclesiastically they were\r\nremoved from the jurisdiction of the Popes to that of the Patriarchs of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nThis breach between the Papacy and the Empire led inevitably to an\r\nalliance between the Papacy and the Franks, which is of such great\r\nhistorical consequence that it must be recounted in some detail. While\r\nthe Empire and the Papacy were quarrelling over ecclesiastical matters,\r\nwestern Europe had been changing. The Frankish kingdom had been\r\nestablished in what is now Belgium, Holland, and large parts of France\r\nand Germany, and was the one great Christian power in Europe. Therefore,\r\nwhen the Papacy had cut loose from the Empire and saw itself defenceless\r\nagainst the Lombards, it had no alternative but to seek help from the\r\nFranks. There were also two special reasons for friendship between the\r\nFranks and the Papacy. First, the Franks, alone of Barbarians, had been\r\nconverted to Catholic Christianity. Secondly, in their endeavours to\r\nenlarge their eastern borders, the Franks had been greatly assisted by\r\nthe missionaries, who--in the normal course, missionaries, merchants,\r\nsoldiers--had prepared the way for Frankish conquest, and had\r\nstrengthened the Frankish power when established. These missionaries\r\nwere absolutely devoted to the Roman See; they spread papal loyalty\r\nwherever they went, and wrought a strong bond of union between the\r\nFrankish kingdom and the Papacy. This union of sympathy and interest was\r\nan excellent basis for a political union; and the time soon came for\r\nsuch a development.\r\n\r\nWhen the iconoclastic revolts occurred in Italy, and the Popes broke\r\nwith the Empire, the Lombard kings thought that their opportunity to\r\nconquer all Italy had come. But instead of making one bold campaign\r\nagainst Rome and the South, they merely laid hands on a few border\r\ncities. The Popes turned with frantic appeals for help to the only power\r\nthat could help them, the Franks. Every time the Lombard king made a\r\nhostile move, the Pope cried aloud for aid. For some time the Franks\r\ndeemed that the balance of political considerations was against\r\nintervention and refused to take part in Italian affairs. Charles\r\nMartel, mayor of the palace and ruler of the Franks in all but name,\r\nstood firm on the policy of non-interference; but his son and successor,\r\nPippin the Short, took a different view. Pippin judged that the time had\r\ncome to depose the royal Merovingian family and to exalt his own, the\r\nCarlovingian, in its stead. As the Merovingians had reigned for two\r\nhundred and fifty years, the step was revolutionary, and Pippin wished\r\nto strengthen his position by the support of the Papacy. He sent\r\nmessengers to the Pope, Zacharias, to ask advice; and the Pope,\r\naccording to the chronicler, \"in the exercise of his apostolical\r\nauthority replied to their question, that it seemed to him better and\r\nmore expedient that the man who held power in the kingdom should be\r\ncalled king and be king, rather than he who falsely bore that name.\r\nTherefore the Pope commanded the king and the people of the Franks, that\r\nPippin, who was using royal power, should be called king and should be\r\nsettled on the throne.\" The last Merovingian, therefore, was tonsured\r\nand stowed away in a monastery, and Pippin became king of the Franks\r\n(751). Without accepting the monkish chronicler's statement, that the\r\nPope commanded Pippin to be king, there can be little doubt that the\r\npapal sanction was of very real value to Pippin, and that Pippin let it\r\nappear that he was acting rather in conformity with the Pope's will than\r\nwith his own.\r\n\r\nThus the Pope laid Pippin under a great obligation; it now remained for\r\nPippin to discharge that obligation. It was not long before the time\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nThe Lombard king felt that his opportunity was slipping by, and acted\r\nwith some vigour. He captured Ravenna and threatened Rome. The Pope\r\nhurried across the Alps. He anointed and crowned Pippin; he likewise\r\nanointed and blessed his son Charles (Charlemagne), and forbade the\r\nFranks under pain of excommunication ever to choose their king from any\r\nother family. These three great favours, the transfer of the royal\r\ntitle, the coronation rite, and the perpetual confirmation of the\r\nCarlovingian sovereignty, called for a great return. Pippin promised\r\nthat the Adriatic provinces, taken by the Lombards from the Byzantines,\r\nshould be ceded by the Lombards to the Pope. This promise Pippin\r\nfulfilled. He crossed the Alps, defeated the Lombard king, and forced\r\nhim to cede the Exarchate of Ravenna and the five cities below it on the\r\ncoast, to the Pope, who thereby became an actual sovereign. Thus Pippin\r\ndischarged his obligation to the Papacy.\r\n\r\nThis beginning of the Papal monarchy is so important that the theoretic\r\norigin may as well be mentioned here. There was a legend, universally\r\nbelieved, that an early Pope, Silvester (314-335) healed the Emperor\r\nConstantine of leprosy, and that the Emperor, in gratitude, made a great\r\ngrant of territory to the Pope. The fact appears to have been that\r\nConstantine, although not cured of the leprosy, did give to Silvester\r\nthe Lateran palace and a plot of ground around it. This little donation\r\ngrew in legend like a grain of mustard seed, and served the purpose of\r\nthe Roman clergy. No good Roman would have been content with a title\r\nderived from the Lombards or the Franks. In Roman eyes these Barbarians\r\nnever had any title to Italian territory; they could give none. The only\r\npossible source of legal title was the Empire. In the gift by\r\nConstantine to Silvester papal adherents had a foundation of fact. That\r\nwas enough. It is quite unnecessary to imagine false dealing. People in\r\nthose days believed that what they wished true was true. This legend was\r\naccepted and embodied in concrete form in a document known as the\r\n_Donation of Constantine_, which is so important in explaining the\r\nattitude of the Papacy throughout the Middle Ages, that it may be\r\nquoted:--\r\n\r\n\"In the name of the holy and undivided Trinity, Father, Son, and Holy\r\nGhost, the Emperor Caesar Flavius Constantine ... to the most holy and\r\nblessed Father of Fathers, Silvester, bishop of Rome and Pope, and to\r\nall his successors in the seat of St. Peter to the end of the world....\"\r\nHere comes, interspersed with snatches of Christian dogma, a rambling\r\nnarrative of his leprosy, of the advice of his physicians to bathe in a\r\nfont on the Capitol filled with the warm blood of babies; how he\r\nrefused, how Peter and Paul appeared in a dream and sent him to\r\nSilvester, how he then abjured paganism, accepted the creed, was\r\nbaptized and healed, and how he then recognized that heathen gods were\r\ndemons and that Peter and his successors had all power on earth and in\r\nheaven. After this long preamble comes the grant:\r\n\r\n\"We, together with all our Satraps and the whole Senate, Nobles and\r\nPeople ... have thought it desirable that even as St. Peter is on earth\r\nthe appointed Vicar of God, so also the Pontiffs his viceregents should\r\nreceive from us and from our Empire, power and principality greater than\r\nbelongs to us ... and to the extent of our earthly Imperial power we\r\ndecree that the Sacrosanct Church of Rome shall be honoured and\r\nvenerated, and that higher than our terrestrial throne shall the most\r\nsacred seat of St. Peter be gloriously exalted.\r\n\r\n\"Let him who for the time shall be pontiff over the holy Church of Rome\r\n... be sovereign of all the priests in the whole world; and by his\r\njudgment let all things which pertain to the worship of God or the faith\r\nof Christians be regulated.... _We hand over and relinquish our palace,\r\nthe city of Rome, and all the provinces, places, and cities of Italy and\r\nthe western regions, to the most blessed Pontiff and universal Pope,\r\nSilvester_; and we ordain by our pragmatic constitution that they shall\r\nbe governed by him and his successors, and we grant that they shall\r\nremain under the authority of the holy Roman Church.\"[5]\r\n\r\nThe date of this document and many statements in it are anachronisms and\r\nerrors. It was composed about the time of Pippin's _Donation_, probably\r\nby somebody connected with the papal chancery, and may be considered to\r\nbe a pious forgery representing the facts as the writer deemed they were\r\nor else should be. It was officially referred to for the first time in\r\n777, but did not receive its full celebrity until the eleventh century,\r\nwhen the relations of the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire became the\r\ncentre of European history.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] _Italy and her Invaders_, T. Hodgkin, vol. vii, pp. 149-151; _Select\r\nHistorical Documents of the Middle Ages_, Ernest F. Henderson, pp.\r\n319-329.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCHARLEMAGNE (768-814)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe papal theory embodied in the _Donation of Constantine_ was obviously\r\ncrammed with seeds of future strife; for the present, however, the\r\nfortunes of the House of Pippin and of the Papacy were bound together in\r\namity. The constant accession of strength to the former and of prestige\r\nto the latter made them the central figures of European politics. The\r\nnew political form to which their union gave birth slowly shaped itself.\r\nIn Italy the first step was to get rid of the Lombards. On the death of\r\nthe Lombard King, Aistulf, there were two claimants for the throne. One\r\nof the two, Desiderius, secured the Pope's help by the promise of ceding\r\nmore cities, and became king. The Pope, writing to Pippin, says: \"Now\r\nthat Aistulf, that disciple of the devil, that devourer of Christian\r\nblood is dead; and that by your aid and that of the Franks [a\r\ncomplimentary phrase, for Pippin seems to have done nothing] he is\r\nsucceeded by Desiderius, a most gentle and good man, we pray you to urge\r\nhim to continue in the right way.\" But the \"most gentle and good\"\r\nDesiderius strayed from the right way, and did not cede the promised\r\ncities. So the Pope besought Pippin to use force; but Pippin thought\r\nthat he had done enough, and the Pope was obliged to rest content.\r\nPippin died in 768. One can imagine the consternation at Rome on\r\nPippin's death to learn that the dowager queen of the Franks was\r\narranging a marriage between her son Charlemagne and a daughter of\r\nDesiderius, and another marriage between her daughter and a son of\r\nDesiderius. The Pope wrote in terror that the plan was of the devil, and\r\nforbade it under the pains of everlasting damnation; nevertheless,\r\nCharlemagne married the daughter of Desiderius (770).\r\n\r\nThe Pope's anticipations, however, were not justified; the horrible\r\nunion of the House of Pippin with the \"unspeakable\" Lombards came to an\r\nabrupt end. Charlemagne, probably from personal dislike, put away his\r\nwife, and sent her ignominiously back to her father. Desiderius, angry\r\nat the insult, rushed upon his fate; he not only intrigued in Frankish\r\naffairs against Charlemagne, but he also seized many of the cities given\r\nto the Pope by the _Donation of Pippin_. He invaded the duchy of Rome,\r\nand advanced within fifty miles of the city. This time Charlemagne acted\r\nin conformity with the papal entreaties. He crossed the Alps, routed the\r\nLombard army, captured Pavia, took Desiderius prisoner and assumed the\r\ntitle of King of the Lombards (773-774). He went on to Rome, and\r\nsolemnly confirmed the _Donation of Pippin_, and also made a further\r\n_Donation_. This latter _Donation_, which led to disputes between the\r\nPapacy and Charlemagne's successors, is a matter of great uncertainty.\r\nSubsequent papal advocates claimed that it embraced two thirds of Italy.\r\nProbably Charlemagne only intended to restore to the Papacy its private\r\nproperty scattered throughout northern and central Italy, which had been\r\nseized by the Lombards.\r\n\r\nCharlemagne, having disposed of the Lombards, continued his conquests;\r\nacross the Pyrenees he annexed the Spanish March, in North Germany he\r\nsubdued the Saxons and pushed his frontier to the Elbe, to the southeast\r\nhe subjugated the country as far as the upper Danube. His monarchy now\r\nincluded Franks, Celts, Visigoths, Burgundians, Saxons, Lombards,\r\nRomans. How were such widespread territories and such diverse peoples to\r\nbe united in permanent union? The far-seeing Papacy, in answer to this\r\nquestion, propounded the revival of the Roman Empire of the Caesars.\r\nReasons were numerous. The Frankish monarchy, with its conquests, in\r\nbulk at least was not unworthy to succeed to Imperial Rome. Throughout\r\nthis wide territory there was a great network of ligaments; from Gascony\r\nto Bavaria, from Lombardy to Frisia, divine service was celebrated in\r\nthe Latin tongue and with the Roman ritual; bishops, priests, monks, and\r\nmissionaries acknowledged their dependence upon the Pope and looked to\r\nRome, with its holy basilicas and apostolic tradition, as the centre of\r\nChristendom. This Christian unity was a constant argument for political\r\nunity. A second argument was the still vigorous Roman tradition. The\r\nidea of nationality was as yet undeveloped; Europe had known no other\r\npolitical system than common subjection to the Roman Empire, and all\r\nnotions of civilization were of a civilization on the Roman pattern.\r\nWhen the Roman Empire in the West had decayed, the Church had adopted\r\nthe Imperial organization and kept remembrance of the old system fresh\r\nin men's minds. The old Empire, moreover, had early lost the notion of\r\ndependence on the city of Rome, for the seat of government had been set\r\nat Constantinople, at Milan, and at Ravenna; and since the days of the\r\nearly Caesars, it had not been necessary for an Emperor to be a native\r\nRoman. There was no theoretical difficulty to bar a Frank from the\r\nImperial throne or forbid the seat of government to a Frankish city. In\r\nfact, nobody could conceive of the Empire as other than Roman, and the\r\nFrankish kingdom could only become an empire by becoming the Roman\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThe Papacy had special reasons for these views. Under the Empire\r\nChristianity had grown up; under the Empire it had obtained power and\r\ndominion, and had become the state religion. The Church might quarrel\r\nwith Emperors, but it regarded the Empire--the source of secular law and\r\norder--as its joint tenant in the world. The one represented religious\r\nunity, the other represented civil unity. In addition to these large\r\narguments, local reasons affected the Papacy. Shortly before the\r\nexpulsion of the Lombards from Italy, the lack of a strong government\r\nhad been wofully felt. One usurper and then another had been put in St.\r\nPeter's chair in riot and bloodshed. It had become plain as day that the\r\nPapacy of itself, without the support of a potent secular power, was not\r\nable to maintain its dignity, nor even to enforce order in the very city\r\nof Rome. The Papacy could not endure without the Empire. The very\r\ntitles which the Frankish kings had gradually received led up to the\r\nImperial title. Gregory II had called Charles Martel \"Patrician,\" a\r\nvague title of honour held by the Exarchs; Gregory III had offered to\r\nhim the titles both of Patrician and of Consul; Stephen II bestowed upon\r\nPippin the title of Patrician of the Romans; Charlemagne's own titles\r\nwere King of the Franks, King of the Lombards, Patrician of the Romans;\r\nand his son had been crowned by the Pope, King of Italy (781). The title\r\nnext in order was undoubtedly Emperor of the Romans. Charlemagne himself\r\nwas a man of gigantic stature and great strength, indefatigable in\r\naction, and delighting in hunting, swimming, and martial exercise. His\r\nmind also was mighty, restlessly pondering questions of state, of\r\nchurch, of war, of social improvement. He was the greatest of\r\nBarbarians, cast by Nature in an imperial mould.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there was one conspicuous difficulty in the way of\r\nreviving the Roman Empire; this difficulty was that the Roman Empire\r\nstill existed, and that there was a living Emperor, the legitimate\r\nsuccessor of Caesar Augustus. But that Empire was virtually Greek, and\r\nthe Emperor no more like Caesar Augustus than like Hercules. The city by\r\nthe Tiber had as good title to be the Imperial city as her younger rival\r\nby the Bosphorus; the _Roman Republic_ (whatever that ill-defined title\r\nmay mean), represented by the Pope, had as fair a claim to elect the\r\nEmperor, as the army and office-holders at Constantinople. In fact, to\r\nPapal and Roman eyes, the rights of Rome were much greater than those of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nTo us, as we look back, nothing seems more natural than that the great\r\nFrankish king, after the conquest of Italy, should have brushed aside\r\nthe theoretical difficulty of an existing Roman Empire and assumed the\r\nImperial title, Emperor of the Romans. History moves more slowly.\r\nCharlemagne was a Frank, accustomed to Frankish usages and ideas; he\r\nhesitated to adopt formally a wholly different conception of sovereignty\r\nand society. His nobles probably agreed with the advice given by Pope\r\nZacharias to Pippin, that the man who held the power should receive the\r\ncorresponding title, but being Franks they thought the dignity of\r\nFrankish king sufficient. So matters stood with nothing between\r\nCharlemagne and the Imperial crown but a theoretic difficulty, and a\r\ncertain reluctance. Unexpectedly and in quick succession, events in\r\nConstantinople swept away the theoretic difficulty, and events in Rome\r\ngave the Pope sufficient energy to overcome the reluctance.\r\n\r\nAt Constantinople, the dowager Empress blinded and deposed her son the\r\nEmperor (797), and assumed to rule as sole _Augusta_. This wickedness,\r\nand the ancient doctrine that, though a woman might lawfully share the\r\nImperial throne, she might not reign alone, combined to render plausible\r\na theory readily adopted in the West, that the Imperial throne had\r\nbecome vacant. The event in Rome was this. A savage gang of nobles and\r\necclesiasts attacked Pope Leo III in the street, beat him, half-blinded\r\nhim, cut his tongue, and imprisoned him in a monastery (799). He escaped\r\nand fled to Charlemagne in Germany. His enemies followed and charged him\r\nwith various crimes. Charlemagne sent him back to Rome in the company\r\nof some great nobles, who were commissioned to investigate the charges,\r\nand went himself also. There, in St. Peter's basilica, in the presence\r\nof Frankish nobles and Roman ecclesiasts, with Charlemagne presiding,\r\nthe Pope took a solemn oath of innocence (December 4, 800). Such an oath\r\naccording to the jurisprudence of the time was necessarily followed by\r\nacquittal; and the Pope's innocence necessarily proved the guilt of his\r\naccusers, who were punished.\r\n\r\nSuch crimes, east and west, were insufferable. Something had to be done.\r\nEverybody looked to Charlemagne. His position as head of Christendom was\r\nacknowledged even beyond the bounds of western Europe. The Patriarch of\r\nJerusalem, a subject of the Caliph Haroun al Raschid, sent to\r\nCharlemagne the keys of Calvary and of the Holy Sepulchre and the banner\r\nof the Holy City. Obviously it was time for the Imperial dignity to be\r\nadded to Imperial power.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas day in the year 800, Charlemagne and a great procession of\r\nFrankish nobles and Roman citizens made their way through the streets of\r\nRome towards the basilica of St. Peter's, whose gilt bronze roof, taken\r\nfrom a pagan temple, shone conspicuous on the Vatican hill. They walked\r\nthrough the Aurelian gate and across the bridge over the Tiber, then\r\nturning to the left, followed the colonnade which extended all the way\r\nfrom Hadrian's Mausoleum to the atrium of the basilica. There they\r\nmounted the broad flight of marble steps, at the top of which the Pope\r\nand his court awaited the king. Then Pope and king, followed by the\r\nprocession, crossed the great atrium paved with white marble, past the\r\nfir-cone fountain and papal tombs, to the central door of the basilica,\r\nwhich swung its thousand-weight of silver open wide; then, up the long\r\nnave, screened by rows of antique columns from double aisles on either\r\nside, all rich with tapestries of purple and gold, they proceeded with\r\nslow and solemn steps to the tomb of the apostle. Thirteen hundred and\r\nseventy candles in the great candelabrum glowed on the silver floor of\r\nthe shrine, and glittered on the gold and silver statues around it. In\r\nthe great apse behind the high altar sat the clergy, row upon row,\r\nbeneath the Pontiff's throne; above, the Byzantine mosaics looked down\r\nin sad severity. Here Charlemagne knelt at the tomb, and prayed. As he\r\nrose from his knees, the Pope lifted an Imperial crown of gold and\r\nplaced it on his head, while all the congregation shouted, \"Life and\r\nVictory to Charles, Augustus, crowned by God, the great and peaceful\r\nEmperor!\"\r\n\r\nThus was accomplished that restoration of the Roman Empire, which by its\r\nattempt to combine Teuton and Roman in political union so powerfully\r\naffected the history of mediaeval Europe. Charlemagne is reported to have\r\nsaid that the Imperial coronation took him by surprise. However that may\r\nbe, this great enterprise of a Christian Empire must be regarded, in its\r\nfinal completion, as the joint work of Frankish king and Roman Pope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFROM CHARLEMAGNE TO NICHOLAS I (814-867)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period from the death of Charlemagne (814) to the coronation of Otto\r\nthe Great (962) is a long dismal stretch, tenanted by discord and\r\nignorance. At the beginning stands the commanding figure of Charlemagne,\r\n\r\n    With Atlantean shoulders, fit to bear\r\n    The weight of mightiest monarchies.\r\n\r\nBut his descendants were unequal to their inheritance, and under them\r\nhis Empire crumbled away and resolved itself into incipient nations.\r\nThat Empire, in theory the restored Roman Empire, was in fact strictly\r\nTeutonic, though buttressed by the Roman Church. Charlemagne deemed\r\nhimself head of both Empire and Church. In his eyes the Pope was his\r\nsubject, and he legislated, as a matter of course, upon ecclesiastical\r\naffairs. In secular matters he endeavoured to maintain local\r\nadministration without detriment to a strong central government. For\r\nthis purpose he divided the Empire into three divisions, of which he\r\nmade his three sons nominally kings, really his lieutenants. Under these\r\nsons he appointed counts and bishops, as local governors. He maintained\r\nhis central authority by means of deputies (_missi dominici_), who\r\ntraversed the whole Empire, two by two, a bishop and a count together.\r\nThe maintenance of such a political unity, however, required either the\r\norganic strength and momentum of the old Roman Empire, or a breed of\r\nCharlemagnes. On the great Emperor's death the forces of disruption made\r\nthemselves felt at once. His son, Louis the Pious, indeed succeeded to\r\nthe whole sovereignty of the Empire; but Louis's sons demanded division.\r\nThey rebelled; and civil war lasted most of Louis's life. After his\r\ndeath the sons fought one another, and finally agreed on a division of\r\nthe territory, though the Imperial title was kept. One brother took the\r\nterritory to the east, destined to become Germany; another, that to the\r\nwest, destined to become France; and Lothair, the eldest, who also\r\nreceived the Imperial title, took Italy and a long, heterogeneous strip\r\nbetween the territories of his brothers. This division was fatal to the\r\nEmpire. On Lothair's death the Imperial crown descended to his son Louis\r\nII (855-875), and afterwards to two other degenerate members of a\r\ndegenerate family. The last made himself unendurable and was deposed\r\n(887). With him ended Charlemagne's legitimate male line, and also the\r\nfirst revival of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThis Empire had been a civilizing power. It had supported the Papacy, as\r\nan oak supports the creeper that clings to it; and in its decline and\r\nfall it pulled the Papacy down with it. Without such support the Papacy\r\ncould maintain neither dignity abroad nor order at home. This lesson the\r\nChurch learned once through the outrages inflicted upon Pope Leo, but\r\nforgot it; and required the experience of a hundred and fifty years to\r\nlearn it a second time. In theory Papacy and Empire were co-equal\r\npowers, religious and secular, together carrying on the noble task of\r\nGod's government on earth. In practice, as their respective rights and\r\npowers had not been definitely set off, they could not agree; each\r\nwished to be master. The relations between the two constitute the great\r\naxis on which mediaeval politics revolve, and for a long time must serve\r\nas the main motive of our story. The contest between them for mastery\r\nresembles a fencing match, in which the Pope thrusts at the Emperor's\r\ncrown, the Emperor parries, and lunges back at the papal tiara. For\r\nconvenience we divide the match into two bouts, and first take the\r\nPope's attack.\r\n\r\nAt the famous coronation on Christmas day, 800, Charlemagne and Leo\r\nstood side by side, co-labourers in the great task of reconstructing\r\nEurope. But once the coronation over, the two undefined authorities\r\njostled each other. Charlemagne, to whom government was as much a\r\nreligious as a secular matter, though he had accepted his Imperial crown\r\nat the hands of the Pope, did not regard papal participation necessary\r\nfor the continuance of the Imperial dignity. At Aachen, 813, he crowned\r\nhis son Louis the Pious co-Emperor, without the help of Pope or priest.\r\nThis thrust must have carried discomfiture to the banks of the Tiber.\r\nBut with Charlemagne's weak successors the astute Papacy scored hit\r\nafter hit. Louis the Pious submitted to be recrowned by the Pope, so did\r\nhis son, Lothair, and his grandson Louis II; and their two successors\r\nwere also crowned by the Pope. This sequence of palpable hits won this\r\nbout and secured for the Papacy beyond dispute the prerogative of\r\ncrowning the Emperors.\r\n\r\nIf we now turn to that part of the game where Emperor lunged and Pope\r\nparried, we find a more complicated situation. A third player takes a\r\nhand, to the confusion of the game and to the great detriment of the\r\npapal defence. This third player is the Roman people, who believed that\r\nthe _Senatus Populusque Romanus_ still possessed their ancient\r\nprerogatives, and had the right to appoint both Emperor and Pope. Their\r\nclaim to elect the Emperor was flimsy enough, being merely the memory of\r\nan empty form, and is not of enough consequence to stop for; but their\r\nclaim to interfere in the papal election was of the highest importance.\r\nIt arose from the anomalous nature of the Papacy. The Pope was bishop of\r\nRome, and as such his election lay in the hands of the clergy and people\r\nof Rome; he was also the ruler of central Italy, and as such the barons\r\nthere were interested in his election; and, in addition, he was head of\r\nall the Christian Churches in the West, and so all western Christendom,\r\nand the Emperor as its temporal lord, was likewise concerned. The fact\r\nwas that no definite method of papal election and confirmation had been\r\nsettled upon during these disturbed centuries. The original practice had\r\nbeen for the Roman churches, priests, and laymen together assembled, to\r\nmake the election; subsequently the senate, or the army, or the nobles,\r\nhad represented the lay body of electors; but whoever represented the\r\nlaymen, they and the clergy made the election; which was then submitted\r\nto the Emperor, or his representative, for scrutiny and confirmation.\r\nThe submission of the Roman election to the examination of a Byzantine\r\nEmperor had never been acceptable in Rome, and after the breach over\r\niconoclasm, the practice ceased. Naturally, on the revival of the Roman\r\nEmpire in the West, the new Emperors claimed the old Imperial right of\r\nsupervision; naturally, also, the papal party resisted the fresh\r\nexercise of the old prerogative. Here was a situation for a scrimmage,\r\nbut any clear account of the papal elections in Rome, supposing such\r\nwere possible, would be too minute; this narrative must confine itself\r\nto the main passes between the papal party and the Emperors.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Charlemagne (no papal election occurred during his\r\nlifetime) several Popes were elected and consecrated without previously\r\nconsulting the Emperor. On the other hand, in the next reign the\r\nImperial deputy made the Romans take oath that no Pope should be\r\nconsecrated without the approval of the Emperor. What was done at the\r\nfollowing election is not known, but at the second the Pope was not\r\nconsecrated until the Emperor had ratified the proceedings. Thereafter\r\nthe Imperial right was acknowledged in theory, though in practice the\r\nelected Pontiffs did not always wait for Imperial confirmation.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of the Carlovingian Empire the fencing match ceased for\r\nlack of an Imperial contestant. The score stood thus: each had succeeded\r\nin the attack, the Papacy had won its right to bestow the Imperial\r\ncrown, and the Empire had won, though not so definitely, its right to\r\nsupervise the election of a Pope. We must now pass to this Imperial\r\ninterregnum knowing that when the Empire shall be revived, the match\r\nwill begin anew and the combatants, with foils unbated and envenomed,\r\nwill fight to a finish.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial interregnum, nominally interrupted by one German and\r\nseveral Italian make-believe Emperors, lasted for three generations; no\r\nImperial power was exercised from 875 to 962. It is a murky period in\r\nwhich shadows wander about; but before taking our candle and descending\r\ninto the gloom, we will turn to the one bright spot, the career of a\r\ngreat Pope, Nicholas I (858-867).\r\n\r\nThis Pope, in spite of the decadence of the Papacy, won immense prestige\r\nfor it by two successful assertions of cosmopolitan authority. The King\r\nof Lorraine, brother to Louis II, the Emperor, wished to put away his\r\nwife and marry another woman. The innocent queen, with the sanction of\r\nthe clergy of the kingdom, was divorced and forced to enter a convent;\r\nand, with the consent of his clergy, the king married the other woman.\r\nThe wronged queen appealed to the Pope, who sent his legates to\r\ninvestigate the affair; but the king bribed the legates and succeeded in\r\ngetting a decision from the local synod in his favour, although, in\r\nfact, the whole matter had been a shocking scandal. Thereupon the king\r\nsent the archbishops of Cologne and of Trier, the two great\r\necclesiastical dignitaries of the kingdom, to announce this verdict of\r\nacquittal. The Pope, \"professing,\" as his enemies said, \"to be\r\nimperator of the whole world,\" seized his opportunity; he espoused the\r\ncause of the innocent queen, annulled the fraudulent proceedings, and\r\nexcommunicated and deposed the two archbishops. The king applied to the\r\nEmperor for help, and the Emperor went to Rome, but could obtain no\r\nconcession. The Pope stood like a rock. He allied himself with France\r\nand Germany, and threatened to excommunicate the sinning husband and all\r\nhis bishops. The king was obliged to submit. The usurping wife was\r\nexcommunicated and banished, and the papal legate conducted the divorced\r\nqueen back to the royal palace. Thus the Papacy not only established a\r\ngreat precedent for the supremacy of the spiritual over the temporal\r\npower, but also stood conspicuous before the world as the champion of\r\nthe weak and oppressed and the defender of morality and justice.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to overrate the effect of this papal achievement.\r\nIt may be that the Papacy stood forth as champion of innocence when\r\npolicy coincided with righteousness; but it was the righteousness and\r\nnot the policy which gave the Papacy strength. One can imagine, in days\r\nwhen brutal barons, scattered in strongholds all over the country, were\r\nthe normal forms of power and authority, what effect such news had upon\r\nthe people. A pilgrim from across the Alps, a peddler, or some poor\r\nvagrant, enters a village huddled at the foot of a hill, on which stands\r\na great castle where a drunken lord revels with his mistresses, and\r\nrecounts to the assembled peasants, serfs, and slaves, how the Holy\r\nFather, in the name of God, had commanded a greater lord, in a greater\r\ncastle, to put away his mistress and bring back his wife, and how that\r\nlord had got down on his knees and had done the Holy Father's bidding.\r\n\r\nThe second case was the victory of papal authority over the spirit of\r\nnationality in the Church. When the incipient nations of France and\r\nGermany, having separated from the Empire, had begun to be\r\nself-conscious, the spirit of nationality naturally showed itself in\r\necclesiastical matters as well as in political matters. There was\r\nobvious likelihood that the nations would govern themselves\r\necclesiastically as well as politically. Should they do so, the papal\r\nsupremacy would fall just as the Imperial supremacy had fallen, and the\r\nunity of the Church would be shattered just as the Empire had been. Here\r\nwas certainly a great danger to the Papacy, and probably a great danger\r\nto Christianity and civilization; at least so Nicholas thought. He\r\nresolved to meet it boldly. His opportunity came when a French (West\r\nFrankish) bishop appealed to Rome against the action of his\r\nmetropolitan. The metropolitan objected that there was no precedent for\r\npapal action in such a case; he did not deny that the Pope had certain\r\nappellate functions, but said that if the Pope interfered directly in\r\nthe discipline of bishops, the power of the metropolitan would be\r\nimpaired. It is needless to say that this argument did not produce the\r\nresult that the metropolitan desired. There was nothing the Papacy\r\nwanted more than that its central government should act directly\r\neverywhere, and that all bishops should be dependent upon Rome; that\r\nwas the very principle of papal supremacy. The issue would determine\r\nwhether the Papacy was to be an autocratic power, or a limited court of\r\nappeal. Nicholas was able to take advantage of the troubled political\r\nsituation to enforce direct papal authority, and so added an immense\r\nprerogative to the papal power.\r\n\r\nApart from this imperial ecclesiastical principle the latter episode is\r\nespecially interesting on account of the character of the evidence\r\nproduced by the Pope to maintain his position. This evidence consisted\r\nof a new compilation of Church law which appeared somewhat mysteriously\r\nabout this time. Theretofore Church law had consisted of a collection of\r\nprecepts taken from the Bible, from the early Fathers, from decrees of\r\nCouncils, and also of letters, called decretals, written by the bishops\r\nof Rome, but none of these decretals was earlier than the time of\r\nConstantine. The fact, that there were no papal decretals prior to\r\nConstantine, seemed to imply, at least to the sceptically minded, that\r\npapal authority had really begun at the time of Constantine and not at\r\nthe time of St. Peter. To the ardent papist such an idea was incredible.\r\nNicholas now produced a new batch of documents. Among these was the\r\n_Donation of Constantine_, of which I have spoken. Others were papal\r\ndecretals, which purported to come from Popes of the third and second\r\ncenturies, and to prove that papal jurisdiction over other bishoprics\r\nhad been exercised almost as far back as the time of St. Peter. These\r\nnew appearing documents placed the Pope not only above kings, but above\r\nmetropolitans and provincial synods, and justified Nicholas in acting\r\ndirectly in the case of the West Frankish bishop, in the King of\r\nLorraine's matrimonial affairs, and also in assuming to act as\r\n\"imperator of the whole world.\" These documents, known as the _Isidorian\r\nDecretals_, were probably composed by some priest in France, not long\r\nbefore their use by Nicholas. For six hundred years they were believed\r\nto be genuine, and during that time rendered the Papacy great service by\r\nranging the sentiment of law throughout Europe (at least until the\r\nrevival of Roman law) on the side of the Papacy in its struggle with the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE DEGRADATION OF ITALY (867-962)\r\n\r\n\r\nThese triumphs were due to the brilliant vigour of Pope Nicholas; but\r\nthat triumphant position could not last, it was fictitious. The Papacy\r\nneeded the support of a strong secular power, and when the Carlovingian\r\nEmpire dissolved, it had nothing to rest on, neither genius nor military\r\nforce, and fell into deep degradation.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate that degradation one episode will suffice; but there must\r\nfirst be a word of prologue. The Papacy, as has been said, occupied an\r\nanomalous position. From this sprang many troubles. As soon as the\r\npressure of Imperial authority was removed, the Papacy tended to become\r\nthe prize of municipal politics, and different parties in Rome (if the\r\nturbulent mobs may be called so) struggled to get possession of it. One\r\nparty, with interests centred on local matters, indifferent to the\r\ngreatness of the Papacy and its European character, and willing to have\r\nthe Pope a mere local ruler, directed its efforts to getting rid of all\r\nImperial and foreign control. The opposite party, with conflicting\r\ninterests, wished for Imperial control, and constituted a kind of\r\nImperial party, less from any large views, than in the hope of deriving\r\nadvantages from Imperial support. Strife between the two parties was the\r\nnormal condition, and often ended in riot and civil war. In this state\r\nof affairs, a certain Pope Formosus (891-896), who belonged to the\r\nImperial faction, went so far as to invite the German king to come down\r\nto Rome and be crowned Emperor. The king actually came and was crowned,\r\nbut accomplished little or nothing, except to arouse bitter hostility in\r\nhis enemies. When Formosus died, his successor was elected from the\r\nopposite faction. The new Pope held a synod of cardinals and bishops,\r\nand before them, the highest Christian tribunal in the world, he\r\nsummoned, upon the charge of violating the canons of the Church, the\r\ndead Formosus, whose body had lain in its grave, for months. The body\r\nwas dug up, dressed in pontifical robes, and propped upon a throne.\r\nCounsel was assigned to it. The accusation was formally read, and the\r\nPope himself cross-questioned the accused, who was convicted and\r\ndeposed. His pontifical acts were pronounced invalid. His robes were\r\ntorn from him, the three fingers of the right hand, which in life had\r\nbestowed the episcopal blessing, were hacked off, and the body was\r\ndragged through the streets and flung into the Tiber.\r\n\r\nThis incident sheds light on mediaeval Rome, and on the character of the\r\npeople with whom the Popes had to live. All the Popes, good, bad, and\r\nindifferent, whether they were struggling with the Empire on great\r\ncosmopolitan questions, or were trying to unite Christendom against\r\nIslam, always had to keep watch on the brutal, ignorant, bloody Roman\r\npeople, who took no interest in great questions, and were always ready\r\nto rob, burn, and murder with or without a pretext.\r\n\r\nNow that we have brought the Frankish Empire to its dissolution, and the\r\nPapacy to its degradation, we must leave the two wrecks for the moment,\r\nand stop in these dark years at the end of the ninth century to see how\r\nItaly herself has fared. The Italian world was out of joint,\r\nintellectually, morally, politically. There can hardly be said to have\r\nbeen a government. For a generation the poor, shrunken Empire had been\r\nbut a shadow, and when the last Carlovingian died, its parts tumbled\r\nasunder. Local barons ruled everywhere. The Imperial title, which\r\nrepresented nothing, and conveyed no power, seemed, however, to have\r\nsome vital principle of its own, some ghostly virtue; at least sundry\r\nkings and dukes thought so and fought for it; but until the coming of\r\nOtto the Great it remained a shadow. North of the Alps duchies and\r\nprovinces united into kingdoms; but the peninsula remained split up into\r\ndiscordant parts. The valley of the Po was divided into various duchies,\r\npeopled by a mixed race of Latins and Lombards, whom the pressure of the\r\nconquering Franks had welded together. South of the Po lay the Imperial\r\nmarquisate of Tuscany. Across the middle of the peninsula stretched the\r\nawkward strip of domain from Ravenna to Rome, inhabited by a race of\r\ncomparatively pure Latin blood. This domain, included in the _Donations_\r\nof Pippin and of Charlemagne, nominally subject to the Papacy under the\r\nsuzerainty of the Empire, was really in the possession of petty nobles,\r\nwho knew no law except force and craft. South of this so-called papal\r\ndomain lay the duchy of Spoleto and the Lombard duchy of Benevento, and\r\nfarther south a few principalities, such as Naples, Amalfi, and Salerno,\r\nand finally in the heel and toe of Italy were the last remains of the\r\nGreek Empire. To the northeast, on its islands, lay the little fishing\r\nand trading city, Venice.\r\n\r\nThe Italians, as we had better call them now that Barbarian and Latin\r\nblood has well commingled, were in a most unenviable condition. Most of\r\nthose who tilled the soil were serfs, and went with the land when it was\r\nsold; some were scarce better than slaves, others were only bound to\r\nrender service of certain kinds or on certain days, either with their\r\nown hands or with beasts. Their lot depended on the humours of the\r\noverseers of great estates. Slaves were worse off because they had no\r\npersonal rights, but they were always decreasing in number despite a\r\nslave trade, for there was a strong religious sentiment against slavery,\r\nand it was common for dying men to liberate their slaves. In the cities\r\npeople were better off, for the artisans were free men, and by banding\r\ntogether in guilds (which had existed ever since the old Roman days)\r\nsecured for themselves a more prosperous condition. But the only\r\nthriving places were the cities of the coast, Venice, Genoa, Pisa,\r\nAmalfi, where trade was already beginning to lay the foundations of\r\nfuture greatness.\r\n\r\nThese glimmerings of commerce were the only lights along the whole\r\nhorizon. Everything else seemed to share the blight that had fallen on\r\nthe Empire and the Papacy. The clergy, whose duty it was to maintain\r\nlearning, failed utterly. Even in the happiest days of the Carlovingian\r\nEmpire, Charlemagne had found it necessary to enact blunt rules for\r\ntheir guidance. \"Let the priests, according to the Apostles' advice,\r\nwithdraw themselves from revellings and drunkenness; for some of them\r\nare wont to sit up till midnight or later, boozing with their\r\nneighbours; and then these men, who ought to be of a religious and holy\r\ndeportment, return to their churches drunken and gorged with food, and\r\nunable to perform the daily and nightly office of praise to God, while\r\nothers sink down in a drunken sleep in the place of their revels.... Let\r\nno priest presume to store provisions or hay in the church.\"[6]\r\nLearning, supposed to be committed to their charge, went out like a\r\nspent candle. Books were almost forgotten, except perhaps here and\r\nthere, in Pavia or Verona, where a grammarian still invoked Virgil to\r\nprosper his muse; or where in an episcopal city, like Ravenna, some\r\nchronicler wrote a history of the bishopric. The theory of historic\r\ntruth on which these chroniclers acted gives an inkling of the mediaeval\r\nattitude towards facts. Father Agnello, a priest of Ravenna, one of\r\nthese chroniclers, says himself: \"If you, who read this History of our\r\nBishopric, shall come to a passage and say, 'Why didn't he narrate the\r\nfacts about this bishop as he did about his predecessors,' listen to the\r\nreason. I, Andrea Agnello, a humble priest of this holy church of\r\nRavenna, have written the history of this Bishopric from the time of St.\r\nApollinaris for eight hundred years and more, because my brethren here\r\nhave begged me and compelled me. I have put down whatever I found the\r\nBishops had undoubtedly done, and whatever I heard from the oldest men\r\nliving, but where I could not find any historical account, nor anything\r\nabout their lives in any way, then, in order to leave no blanks in the\r\nholy succession of bishops, I have made up the missing lives by the help\r\nof God, through your prayers, and I believe I have said nothing untrue,\r\nbecause those bishops were pious and pure and charitable and winners of\r\nsouls for God.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe monks were no better than the secular clergy. The monasteries had\r\ngrown large, for many men had joined in order to escape military\r\nservice, or to obtain personal security, or an easier life, or greater\r\nsocial consideration; they had also grown rich, for many sinners on\r\ntheir deathbeds had given large sums, in hope to compound for their\r\nsins. Naturally monastic vows were often broken. Moreover, the little\r\ngood that monks and priests did they undid by their encouragement of\r\nsuperstition. They first frightened the poor peasants out of their wits\r\nby portraying the horrors of hell, and then preached the magical\r\nproperties of the sacraments and of saints' bones, until the ordinary\r\nman, feeling himself the sport of superhuman agencies, abandoned all\r\nself-confidence and surrendered himself to priestly control as his sole\r\nhope of safety in this world or the next.\r\n\r\nOppressed by anarchy, by division, by a degenerate church, by a gross\r\nclergy, and by waxing ignorance, Italy might seem to have had its cup\r\nof evil full. There was but one further ill that could be added, a new\r\nBarbarian invasion. It came. The triumphant Saracens, having overrun\r\nSpain and raided France in the west, having cooped up the Byzantine\r\nEmpire in the east, now threatened to plant their victorious banners in\r\nthe very heart of Christendom. As early as Charlemagne's last years they\r\nsacked a coast town scarce forty miles from Rome. In 827 they invaded\r\nSicily, invited by a partisan traitor. Within ten years they had made\r\nthemselves masters of almost all the island, except a few strongholds\r\nwhich managed to hold out for half a century. The beaten Byzantines\r\nretired to the mainland; but they did not get beyond the reach of the\r\nvictorious Saracens, who raided all the Italian coast as far as the\r\nTiber. Troops of marauders hovered round Rome and harried the\r\ncountry-side, robbing and pillaging at will. One band advanced to the\r\nvery gates of the city, and sacked St. Peter's and St. Paul's, both\r\noutside the walls and undefended (846). All the southern provinces were\r\noverrun, half of their towns became Saracen fortresses. It seemed as if\r\nItaly were to undergo the fate of Spain and become a Mohammedan Emirate.\r\n\r\nThe danger to Rome roused the country. A Christian league was effected\r\nbetween the Imperial forces in Italy, the Pope, and the coast cities of\r\nthe south,--Naples, Gaeta, and Amalfi. Pope Leo himself blessed the\r\nfleet, and the Christians beat the infidels in a great sea-fight not far\r\nfrom the Tiber's mouth (849). Some of the prisoners were brought to Rome\r\nand set to work on the walls which Pope Leo was building round the\r\nVatican hill to protect St. Peter's; and Rome, imitating the days of\r\nScipio Africanus, celebrated another triumph over Africa. The fighting\r\nwas kept up all over the south. The Greek Emperor made common cause with\r\nhis fellow Christians, and the immediate danger of conquest was\r\narrested; but throughout this dismal ninth century, and all the tenth,\r\nsouthern Italy continued to suffer from Saracen marauders. The tales\r\ntold of their cruelty are fearful, and match our tales of Indian raids\r\nin the old French-English war. Separate villages and lonely monasteries\r\nsuffered most. Some good came out of the evil, however, for the\r\nchroniclers relate how the abbots and their terrified brethren spent\r\ndays and nights fasting and in prayer.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of Italy when the Imperial Carlovingian line came\r\nto an end. The omnipresence of anarchy was a permanent argument for the\r\nneed of an Imperial restoration. But the country did not know how to go\r\nto work to restore the Empire. At first various claimants asserted\r\nvarious titles, and Italian dukes and neighbouring kings fought one\r\nanother like bulls, but none were able to establish any stable power. In\r\nthe midst of these ineffectual struggles one real effort was made.\r\nArnulf, king of the Germans, who regarded himself as the true successor\r\nof the great Frankish house and of right Imperial heir, marched down\r\ninto Italy at the invitation of Pope Formosus, as we have seen, and\r\nassumed the Imperial crown (896). The expedition was barren of\r\nconsequences, but it gives us another glimpse of the anomalous nature of\r\nthe Papacy, and the different views entertained of it on the two sides\r\nof the Alps. The German king wished to be Emperor, and felt that an\r\nImperial coronation at Rome by the Pope was essential. To him and to his\r\nGerman subjects the papal invitation was of high authority. When he\r\nreached Rome, however, the seat of the Papacy, he found the gates barred\r\nand the walls manned by rebellious citizens, who had locked the Pope in\r\nthe Castle of Sant' Angelo, and had seized the government of the city.\r\nArnulf easily carried the defences by storm and liberated the Pope. The\r\nincident illustrates the contrast between Teutonic respect and Roman\r\ndisobedience, and describes the papal situation as it was half the time\r\nthroughout the Middle Ages. Honoured and reverenced by the pious\r\nultramontanes, the Popes were insulted, robbed, imprisoned, and deposed\r\nby their immediate subjects. This local disobedience, or, as it should\r\nbe called, Roman republicanism, was often the insignificant cause of\r\npapal actions of far-reaching effect. The Popes were never strong enough\r\nof themselves to suppress these republican sentiments and ambitions;\r\nthey needed support from some power, Italian or foreign. As they would\r\nnot endure the idea of an Italian kingdom, they adopted the alternative\r\nof calling in a foreign power. This was the constant papal policy.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of Roman republicanism, or disobedience (as one\r\nchooses), throws further light on the nature of this thorn in the papal\r\nside. Not long after Arnulf's expedition, two women, Theodora and\r\nMarozia, mother and daughter, played a great part not only in Roman but\r\nalso in Italian politics. These two women ruled the city and appointed\r\nthe Popes. They were bold, comely, much-marrying women, choosing\r\neligible husbands almost by force; both were wholly Roman in the\r\nfierceness, vigour, and sensuality of their characters. They were very\r\ncapable, and, in part directly, in part through their husbands and\r\nothers, exercised control for some thirty years; and when the daughter\r\ndisappeared from history, her son, Alberic, took the title, Prince and\r\nSenator of all the Romans, and ruled in her stead.\r\n\r\nThus the last hope of Italians helping themselves perished; for if the\r\nPapacy was powerless, there was no help elsewhere in Italy. The\r\nusurpation of these viragoes and of Alberic differs in details from the\r\nusurpation of the later republicans, and of the Colonna, Orsini, and\r\nother barons, who shall appear hereafter in papal history, but for\r\ngeneral effect on papal affairs and through them on European affairs,\r\nall these usurpations were very similar. The usurpers, in diverse\r\ncharacters, represent that third player in the fencing match, who,\r\nthough by no means an ally of the Empire, frequently rushed in and\r\nstruck up the Pope's guard, and continued to interfere for hundreds of\r\nyears, until the Popes of the Renaissance finally established their\r\ntemporal power in the city of Rome.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the tenth century the disintegration of Italy had\r\nbecome so bad that it caused its own cure. It was obvious that something\r\nmust be done. The Saracens, strongly established in Sicily, were a\r\nstanding menace towards the south. From the north wild bands of\r\nHungarians burst across the Alps and harried the land in barbaric raids\r\nas far as Rome. Feudal anarchy prevailed everywhere. Monks and clergy\r\nwere, to say the least, no help. Even the Papacy, the only stable power,\r\nhad become the appanage of a Roman family. There was but one way out of\r\nthis chaos. The Roman Empire must be restored. The Latin people never\r\nbelieved that it was extinct but merely lying latent, requiring some\r\nhappy application of might and right to set it going again on its\r\nmajestic course. Charlemagne, in his day, had supplied the might. That\r\nmight had faded away. Where was its substitute to be found? Pope\r\nFormosus and King Arnulf had already suggested the only possible\r\nanswer,--in the eastern portion of the Frankish Empire, the kingdom of\r\nGermany. That kingdom, composed of the great duchies of Bavaria, Swabia,\r\nFranconia, Saxony, and Lorraine, had become tolerably compact; it was\r\nstrong at home, and was eager for glory and power abroad. Its ambitious\r\nking, Otto, of the Saxon line, was the man to undertake to follow\r\nCharlemagne's example. It was too late to hope to restore the\r\nCarlovingian Empire in its former boundaries, but with Germany to give\r\nstrength and Rome to contribute title, there would be the two necessary\r\nelements for a renewal of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nThe immediate pretext of Otto's coming down into Italy was highly\r\nromantic. A lovely lady, the widow of one Italian pretender to the\r\nthrone of Italy, was pestered with offers of marriage from another\r\npretender. She refused, and was locked up in a tower by the Lake of\r\nGarda, where memories of Catullus and Lesbia still faintly lingered. She\r\ncontrived to escape, and sent piteous messages for help to the great\r\nOtto, then a widower. Discontented factions in the north, and others\r\nsuffering from oppression, including the Pope who had been rudely roused\r\nto the need of Imperial support, also sent messengers asking him to\r\ncome. Otto came, took Pavia, and acted as King of Italy. He married the\r\nlovely widow, and wished to go to Rome to receive the Imperial crown;\r\nbut Alberic, lord of Rome, would not give permission. Otto went back to\r\nGermany and bided his time. In ten years Alberic died leaving a young\r\nson, who, although only seventeen years old, inherited enough of his\r\nfather's power to get himself elected Pope, John XII. Pope John,\r\nhowever, found himself encompassed by powerful enemies both in Rome and\r\nout. He too was obliged to recognize the absolute necessity of Imperial\r\nrestoration, and called upon Otto for aid. The German king came, and was\r\ncrowned by the Pope, Emperor of the Romans, in St. Peter's basilica, on\r\nthe second day of February, 962. This coronation was the beginning of a\r\nnew phase in the Roman Empire. In this phase that Empire is known as the\r\nHoly Roman Empire, although it was merely a union of Germany, Italy, and\r\nBurgundy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] _Italy and her Invaders_, Hodgkin, vol. viii, p. 289.\r\n\r\n[7] _Le cronache italiane del medio evo descritte_, Balzani\r\n(translated).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE REVIVAL OF THE PAPACY (962-1056)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Roman Empire (it did not receive its full title of Holy Roman\r\nEmpire until later) deserved the name Roman because it rested on the\r\nRoman tradition of the political unity of the civilized world. This\r\ntradition, by means of the ecclesiastical unity of Europe, had survived\r\nthe Barbarian invasions, had gained strength through Charlemagne's\r\nEmpire, and now joined together two nations so fundamentally different\r\nas Germany and Italy. The Germans were big blond men, beer-drinkers,\r\nhuge eaters, rough, ill-mannered, arrogant, phlegmatic and brave; the\r\nItalians were little, dark-skinned men, wine-drinkers, lettuce-eaters,\r\nwith pleasant manners, gesticulating, excitable, and unwarlike. Their\r\nunion affords the strongest testimony to the strength of the Roman\r\ntradition. This ill-assorted pair, married in obedience to the will of\r\ndead generations, could not live together in peace. The theory of a\r\nworld conjointly ruled by a supreme secular sovereign and a supreme\r\necclesiastical sovereign could not be put into successful practice. The\r\nEmpire was German, the Papacy Italian, and by their very natures they\r\nwere antagonistic.\r\n\r\nOtto's empire was by no means universal, but its suzerainty was\r\nacknowledged by Bohemia, Moravia, Poland, Denmark, perhaps by Hungary,\r\nand sometimes by France; and therefore, as eastern Europe was either\r\nGreek or barbarian, Britain an island, and Spain practically Mohammedan,\r\nit sustained fairly well the idea of a universal (_i. e._, European)\r\nempire. The essential parts were Germany to give strength, and Italy to\r\ngive title and tradition. In theory the process of royal and Imperial\r\nelection and coronation was as follows. The German electors (the greater\r\nnobles), whose number was not limited to seven for two centuries and\r\nmore, elected a king, who was crowned with a silver crown at Aachen,\r\nand, by virtue of his coronation, received the title, King of the\r\nRomans. This king then took the iron crown of Lombardy at Pavia, and\r\nbecame King of Italy; and, when he received the gold Imperial crown from\r\nthe Pope at Rome, became Emperor. The election of the son of the late\r\nEmperor to succeed was the custom, but was not obligatory. Germany was\r\nnot a strongly centralized state, but was composed of several dukedoms,\r\nwhich often fell out among themselves. Italy was still less a political\r\nunit. It had no marks of nationality, except its geographical position,\r\nits ancient tradition, and a tardily forming language; but even this\r\n_lingua volgare_, which in Otto's time began to have an Italian sound,\r\nand to touch the degenerate written Latin with an Italian look, did not\r\nprevail throughout the peninsula. In the south Greek was still spoken,\r\nand the Holy Roman Empire never had more than the shadow of a title\r\nsouth of Benevento till after Barbarossa's time. The Emperor's authority\r\nrested at bottom on the German military power; and as this depended on\r\nthe obedience of wayward and jealous dukedoms, it was uncertain and\r\nintermittent.\r\n\r\nThe Papacy was far more stable, for fundamentally it was a moral power,\r\nand got its energy from men's consciences. It was far better organized\r\nthan the Empire. The ecclesiastical system spread all over Europe, into\r\nevery city, village, hamlet, and monastery; countries which reluctantly\r\nacknowledged the suzerainty of the Empire, bowed unquestioningly to\r\npapal rule. Moreover, the power of the Papacy did not merely consist in\r\nspiritual weapons, terrible as the ban of excommunication was in those\r\ndays, but also in its ability to raise up enemies against its enemy, and\r\nto put the cloak of piety over war and rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe ironical element in the situation was that the Empire itself lifted\r\nthe Papacy to the position in which it was able to turn and defy the\r\nEmpire, fight it, and finally destroy it. The Emperors, who entertained\r\nno doubts that the Papacy was subject to them, that they were\r\nresponsible for its conduct and must secure the election of worthy\r\nPopes, took the Papacy out of the hands of the Roman faction, purified\r\nit, and appointed honest, capable, upright Popes.\r\n\r\nA contemporary account of Otto's dealings with that young scamp, Pope\r\nJohn XII, who in morals resembled his grandmother, Marozia, gives a good\r\npicture of the nature of the benefits which the Empire conferred on the\r\nPapacy: \"While these things were taking place, the constellation of\r\nCancer, hot from the enkindling rays of Phoebus, kept the Emperor\r\naway from the hills around Rome, but when the constellation of Virgo\r\nreturning brought back the pleasant season he went to Rome upon a secret\r\ninvitation from the Romans. But why should I say _secret_ when the\r\ngreater part of the nobility burst into the Castle of St. Paul and\r\ninvited the holy Emperor, and even gave hostages? The citizens received\r\nthe holy Emperor and all his men within the city, promised allegiance,\r\nand took an oath that they would never elect a Pope, nor consecrate him,\r\nwithout the consent and the sanction of the Lord Emperor Otto, Caesar,\r\nAugustus, and of his son, King Otto.\r\n\r\n\"Three days later, at the request of the Roman bishops and people, there\r\nwas a great meeting in St. Peter's Church, and with the Emperor sat the\r\narchbishops of Aquileia, Milan, and Ravenna, the archbishop of Saxony\r\n[and many other Italian and German prelates]. When they were seated, and\r\nsilence made, the holy Emperor got up and said: 'How fit it would be\r\nthat in this distinguished and holy council our lord Pope John should be\r\npresent! But since he has refused to be of your company, we ask your\r\ncounsel, holy fathers, for you have the same interest as he.' Then the\r\nRoman prelates, cardinals, priests, and deacons, and all the people\r\ncried out: 'We are surprised that your reverend prudence should wish to\r\nmake us investigate that which is not hidden from the Iberians, the\r\nBabylonians, nor the Indians. He [the Pope] is no longer one of that\r\nkind, which come in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravening wolves;\r\nhe rages so openly, does his diabolical misdeeds so manifestly, that we\r\nneed not beat about the bush.' The Emperor answered: 'We deem it just\r\nthat the accusations should be stated one by one, and after that we will\r\ntake counsel together of what we ought to do.'\r\n\r\n\"Then Cardinal-priest Peter got up, and testified that he had seen the\r\nPope celebrate mass without communion. John, bishop of Narni, and John,\r\ncardinal-deacon, declared that they had seen him ordain a deacon in a\r\nstable, and not at the proper hour. Cardinal-deacon Benedict, with other\r\npriests and deacons, said that they knew that he ordained bishops for\r\nmoney, and that in the city of Todi he had ordained as bishop a boy ten\r\nyears old. They said it was not necessary to go into his sacrileges\r\nbecause they had seen more such than could be reckoned. They said in\r\nregard to his adulteries.... They said that he had publicly gone\r\na-hunting; that he had put out the eyes of his spiritual father,\r\nBenedict, who died soon after in consequence; that he had mutilated and\r\nkilled John, cardinal-subdeacon; and they testified that he had set\r\nbuildings on fire, armed with helmet and breastplate, and girt with a\r\nsword. All, priests and laymen, cried out that he had drunk a toast to\r\nthe devil. They said that while playing dice he had invoked the aid of\r\nJupiter, Venus, and other demons. They declared that he had not\r\ncelebrated matins, nor observed the canonical hours, and that he did not\r\ncross himself.\r\n\r\n\"When the Emperor had heard all this, he bade me, Liutprand, bishop of\r\nCremona, interpret to the Romans, because they could not understand his\r\nSaxon. Then he got up and said: 'It often happens, and we believe it\r\nfrom our experience, that men in great place are slandered by the\r\nenvious, for a good man is disliked by bad men just as a bad man is\r\ndisliked by good men. And for this reason we entertain some doubts\r\nconcerning this accusation against the Pope, which Cardinal-deacon\r\nBenedict has just read and made before you, uncertain whether it springs\r\nfrom zeal for justice or from envy and impiety. Therefore with the\r\nauthority of the dignity granted to me, though unworthy, I beseech you\r\nby that God, whom no man can deceive howsoever he may wish, and by His\r\nholy mother, the Virgin Mary, and by the most precious body of the\r\nprince of the Apostles, in whose Church we now are, that no accusation\r\nbe cast at our lord the Pope of faults which he has not committed and\r\nwhich have not been seen by the most trustworthy men.'\" The accusers\r\naffirmed their charges on oath. Then the holy Synod said: \"If it please\r\nthe holy Emperor let letters be sent to our lord the Pope, bidding him\r\ncome and clear himself of these charges.\" The wary John did not come,\r\nbut wrote: \"I, Bishop John, servant of the servants of God, to all the\r\nbishops. We have heard that you propose to elect another Pope. If you do\r\nthat, I excommunicate you in the name of Almighty God so that you shall\r\nnot have the right to ordain anybody, nor to celebrate mass.\"[8]\r\nNevertheless, John was deposed and a good Pope put in his stead.\r\n\r\nOtto's successors, one after the other, followed his example, and\r\ntreated the Papacy as if it had been a German bishopric. The Emperors,\r\nhowever, had work to do north of the Alps, and did not spend much time\r\nin Rome, except Otto III, a romantic dreamer, who wished to live there;\r\nand during their absence the turbulent Roman anti-imperial faction used\r\nto seize the Papacy, just as Alberic had done, and put up worthless\r\nPopes. In spite of them the Emperors' Popes raised the Papacy so high\r\nthat, as a matter of course, it became the head of the great\r\necclesiastical reform movement which swept over Europe in the eleventh\r\ncentury, and from that movement drew in so much force and energy that it\r\nbecame the greatest power in Europe, and was enabled finally to\r\noverthrow the Empire.\r\n\r\nThis tide of reform arose at Cluny, a little place in Burgundy, and\r\nbegan as a monastic reform. All over Christendom monasteries had grown\r\nrich and prosperous; many monks had forsaken Benedict's rule, had broken\r\ntheir vows and lived with wives and children upon revenues intended for\r\nother purposes. Other monks hated this evil conduct, and burning with a\r\npassionate desire to stop it, started a great movement of monastic\r\nreform. The reform was ascetic in character, as a moral emotion in those\r\ndays was bound to be. The first reformers gathered at Cluny, about the\r\nbeginning of the tenth century. From there disciples went far and wide,\r\npurging old monasteries and founding new. After a time the reformers\r\npassed beyond the early stage of mere moral revolt against godless\r\nliving, formed a party, and put forward a creed. The party represented\r\nantagonism to the world, pitted saints against sinners, the Church\r\nagainst the State. The creed had three tenets. No ecclesiasts should\r\nmarry, and married men upon ordination should live apart from their\r\nwives. No bribery, no corrupt bargain, should taint the appointment and\r\ninstallation of clergy, high or low. No layman should meddle with the\r\nentry of bishops upon their episcopal office. These three tenets roused\r\nbitter opposition. Celibacy of the clergy had been a rule of Church\r\ndiscipline since early days, and from time to time efforts had been made\r\nto enforce the practice, but it had fallen into general disregard. A\r\ncelibate clergy, with no affections or interests nearer or dearer than\r\nthe Church, would be a tremendous ecclesiastical force, and far-sighted\r\nPopes always sought to enforce the rule. Necessarily the married clergy\r\nand many clerical bachelors were violent in opposition. The article\r\nagainst simony nobody openly gainsaid; but many bishops and abbots had\r\nobtained their offices by corrupt practices, and many nobles looked\r\nforward to rich livings and high ecclesiastical places; both classes\r\nopposed a change. The third article, against lay investiture of bishops,\r\nwhich was to be the cause of deadly war between Empire and Papacy, was a\r\nlogical conclusion from the article against simony; for it was hard to\r\nsuppose that in the appointment of bishops, kings and princes would\r\ndisregard all worldly motives and appoint men solely for the good of\r\nsouls. On the other hand, the great bishoprics and abbeys were among the\r\nmost important fiefs in a king's gift, and carried with them feudal\r\nprivileges of sovereignty, such as rights of coinage, toll, holding\r\ncourts, etc.; in short, they were mere secular fiefs with ecclesiastical\r\nprerogatives added. It was natural that the German Emperors should claim\r\nthe right to appoint and invest these spiritual barons, and insist that\r\ntheir episcopal territories should be subject to the same feudal\r\nobligations and the same civic duties as the territories granted to lay\r\nbarons. This third article was a direct attack on the civil power. If\r\nall Imperial participation were to be stricken out, and bishops put into\r\npossession of their fiefs solely by the Pope, then vast territories,\r\nestimated to be nearly half the Empire, would be withdrawn from civic\r\nobligations, even from military service, and the Pope, ousting the\r\nEmperor, would become monarch of half the Imperial domains. According to\r\nthe canons of the Church, the clergy and the people of the diocese\r\nelected the bishop, and the Church bestowed on him ring and staff, the\r\nsigns of episcopal office. The trouble arose over the fief. In feudal\r\ntimes the kings had enfeoffed bishops with great fiefs in order to\r\ncounterbalance the insubordinate secular lords, and because, in\r\nepiscopal hands, these fiefs did not become hereditary. When the\r\nreformers took the matter up, they found that in practice the kings did\r\nnot wait for a canonical election of episcopal candidates, but invested\r\ntheir henchmen in return for money or some service which had no savour\r\nof sanctity. The episcopal office, as St. Peter Damian complained, was\r\ngot \"by flattering the king, studying his inclination, obeying his beck,\r\napplauding every word that fell from his mouth, by acting the parasite\r\nand playing the buffoon.\" The real difficulty lay in the double nature\r\nof the episcopal office, half ecclesiastical and half feudal; and, like\r\nother great political difficulties, would not yield to a peaceful\r\nsolution, until there had been a trial of strength between the\r\ndiscordant interests.\r\n\r\nThe first consequence, however, of the reforming spirit was to ennoble\r\nthe whole Church, to purify her members, and animate them with a common\r\nzeal, and to uplift her head, the Papacy. It carried on, in a larger way\r\nand with a greater sweep, the work of ecclesiastical reformation begun\r\nby the intervention of the Emperors in the election of Popes, and gave a\r\nloftier tone to European politics.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] _Le cronache italiane del medio evo descritte_, Balzani, p. 123.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE OVER INVESTITURES (1059-1123)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe struggle over the lay investiture of bishops did not arise at first.\r\nThe Papacy was still a dependent bishopric in the gift of the Emperors,\r\nwho continued to depose bad Roman Popes and appoint upright Germans.\r\nPopes and Emperors worked together to enforce celibacy among the clergy\r\nand to put down simony. The Emperors could not see, what is evident in\r\nretrospect, that when the spirit of reform should have taken full\r\npossession of the Papacy, then the Papacy would not rest content to be a\r\nGerman bishopric, but, in obedience to the law which links political\r\nambition to political vigour, would even aim so high as to try to reduce\r\nthe Empire itself to the condition of a papal fief. The spirit of\r\nreform, embodied in a man of genius, did take possession of the Papacy\r\nand the great struggle began.\r\n\r\nAmong the crowd that thronged to Cluny eager for a higher life, was a\r\nyoung Tuscan from Orvieto, Hildebrand by name, of plebeian birth. Small\r\nof stature, vehement in spirit, passionate in feeling and action, he was\r\nconfident in himself and yet sensitive to sympathy. This lad became an\r\neager scholar, but in spite of erudition and fondness for study, he was\r\nessentially a man of action, a born leader of men. \"What he taught by\r\nword he proved by example.\" He believed absolutely in the tenets of the\r\nreformers. He believed with his whole being that the Church was a divine\r\ninstitution to save men's souls, and he could not endure the idea of\r\nsecular powers and worldly influences intermeddling with God's fabric.\r\nHis career exhibits the power of a man of genius, who devotes his whole\r\nlife to what for him is the highest end, and is able to use human\r\nenthusiasm for good as his implement.\r\n\r\nHildebrand has been called the Julius Caesar of the Papacy. He went to\r\nRome about 1048. From that time papal policy became definite, vigorous,\r\nstamped with an antique Roman stamp; and open conflict with the Empire\r\nwas the inevitable result. Hildebrand's first care was to protect the\r\nPapacy from the petty-minded Roman faction; he supported papal\r\ncandidates of high character and even secured the appointment of a\r\nGerman, sagaciously foreseeing that ecclesiastical patriotism would be\r\nstronger than national patriotism. These Popes put Hildebrand's views\r\ninto execution.\r\n\r\nNow that the Papacy had been rescued from the Roman faction, the next\r\nstep was to free it from the Egyptian bondage of subjection to the\r\nEmpire. Hildebrand was ready to strike whenever a fair opportunity\r\nshould come. It soon came. The Emperor died, leaving his son Henry IV, a\r\nlittle boy, his successor on the German throne and heir to the Empire. A\r\nlong minority seemed to reveal the hand of Providence. Hildebrand acted.\r\nIt had long been obvious that one cause of papal subjection to Roman\r\nfaction and Imperial tyrant had been the uncertainty of the electoral\r\nbody. Emperors, Roman nobles, and Roman rabble, all had certain historic\r\nelectoral rights. Hildebrand resolved to dispossess them all. A synod\r\nwas held, which declared that the election of the Pope lay in the hands\r\nof the cardinals (1059). Some right of approval was left to the Roman\r\npeople, some right of sanction to the Emperor, but the right of original\r\nelection was vested in the cardinals, and this gradually developed into\r\nan absolute and exclusive right of election. This act was an act of\r\nrebellion towards the Empire, a declaration of independence. Hildebrand\r\nsaid that he strove to make the Church \"free, pure, and catholic.\" This\r\naction made it free.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be expected that the Empire would acquiesce tamely in this\r\nrebellion. Imperialists and Romans made common cause against the\r\nclerical rebels. But the height of the conflict was not reached till\r\nHildebrand himself was elevated to the Papacy (1073), becoming Gregory\r\nVII. He immediately took the offensive. Burning with conviction himself,\r\nhe appealed to the general enthusiasm both in the Church and throughout\r\nthe Empire for the cause of God; he ruthlessly denounced simony and\r\nproclaimed principles of papal sovereignty absolute and universal. \"The\r\nRoman Church was founded by God alone; she never has erred and never\r\nwill err, and no man is a Catholic who is not at peace with her. The\r\nRoman bishop alone is universal. He may depose bishops and reinstate\r\nthem, he may transfer them from one see to another, he may depose\r\nemperors, and may absolve the subjects of the unjust from their\r\nallegiance. No synod without his consent is general; no episcopal\r\nchapter, no book, canonical without his authority. No man may sit in\r\njudgment on his decrees, but he may judge the decrees of all.\" Here\r\ncertainly was a second Julius Caesar in ambition. Gregory claimed feudal\r\nsupremacy over Bohemia, Russia, Hungary, Spain, Corsica, Sardinia,\r\nDalmatia, Croatia, Poland, Scandinavia, and England. Such claims were\r\nvague and shadowy; but the claims to interfere between the German king\r\nand the German episcopate and clergy were definite and direct. The\r\nPapacy declared its own supremacy, and the Imperial duty of obedience.\r\n\r\nGregory had immense moral support at his back, yet moral support would\r\nnot have sufficed to protect him from the king's anger. Nor would\r\nGregory have ventured on so haughty a course, had he not had allies of\r\nanother character. These allies were four in number, and require some\r\ndescription. First in importance come the Normans. For years bands of\r\nNorman warriors, pious folk, had passed through Southern Italy on their\r\nway to the Holy Land. Once a handful had helped a prince of Salerno to\r\nrepel a Saracen attack. The prince, so the story goes, delighted with\r\ntheir valour, begged them to invite their compatriots to come. The\r\ninvitation was readily accepted. Bands of gentlemen adventurers came,\r\nfought against Saracens, or Greeks, or the independent dukes and princes\r\nof Southern Italy, first as mercenaries in anybody's pay, and afterwards\r\non their own account. They soon conquered a domain, and reached out in\r\nall directions. Some drove out the last Byzantines and acquired Southern\r\nItaly; some crossed to Sicily, performed prodigies of valour against the\r\nSaracens, and finally conquered the whole island (1060-90). In their\r\nraids northward they trespassed upon papal territory and came into\r\ncollision with the Church. St. Peter's sword was drawn and brandished,\r\nbut ineffectually. The Popes then concluded that martial deeds did not\r\nbecome them; and the Normans, on their part, were pious folk; so\r\ntogether they formed a happy solution. The Normans had possession of\r\nSouthern Italy and Sicily, but merely by right of conquest; they were in\r\nthe midst of an alien and far more numerous subject people, and wished\r\nfor a legal title. The Popes, unable to acquire actual possession, did\r\nhave, thanks to the _Donation of Constantine_, a legal title, derived,\r\nso they claimed, from the original source of legal titles, the Roman\r\nEmpire. The mode of agreement was obvious; the Popes conferred Southern\r\nItaly and Sicily as feuds upon their liegemen the Norman chiefs, and\r\nthey in return acknowledged the Popes as their lords suzerain. In this\r\nmanner, \"by the grace of God and St. Peter,\" the Normans founded the\r\nkingdom of the Two Sicilies, which for centuries after the Norman line\r\ndied out continued to acknowledge the overlordship of the Papacy. The\r\nNormans were often disobedient vassals, but they knew that the Empire\r\nregarded them as robbers, and in the wars between Empire and Papacy\r\nremained loyal to their lords the Popes.\r\n\r\nThe second papal ally was Countess Matilda (1046-1115), mistress of the\r\nMarquisate of Tuscany and other domains, which stretched from the papal\r\nboundaries up across the Po to Lombardy, and like her mother, her\r\npredecessor in title, a brave, capable, devout woman. As the Normans\r\nwere a defence to the Papacy on the south, so these ladies constituted a\r\nbulwark on the north, and often rendered incalculable service to the\r\nPopes of this period. Matilda's devotion to Gregory was boundless. \"Like\r\na second Martha, she ministered unto him, and as Mary hearkened unto\r\nChrist, so did she, attentive and assiduous, hearken to all the words of\r\nthe Holy Father.\" She and her mother make clear one source of papal\r\nstrength. They show us the attitude of the women, who, from sentiments\r\nof morality, piety, and superstition, took the religious side of the\r\nquarrel, and did not rest till fathers, brothers, husbands, and lovers\r\nhad also espoused it. One act of feminine devotion fixes Matilda in the\r\nmemory. Her domains consisted of marquisates, counties, baronies, and\r\nvarious feudal estates, held as feuds of the Empire, over which on her\r\ndeath she had no power of disposition, and also of large private\r\nestates, which she was free to give or devise. All these, Imperial feuds\r\nand private estates, she gave or rather attempted to give to the Church.\r\nThis _Donation_, the most important since that of Charlemagne, gave\r\nfresh causes of quarrel between Papacy and Empire. The Papacy attempted\r\nto make good its claim to the Imperial feuds; and the Empire, finding it\r\nimpossible to discover the boundaries between the two species of\r\nterritories, also claimed the whole.\r\n\r\nThe third papal ally is to be found in the cities of Lombardy, which had\r\nnow become rich and important. In these cities, especially in Milan,\r\nwhich was easily first commercially and politically, trade had created a\r\nburgher class which already gave evidence of a desire for political\r\npower. In Milan itself there was extreme political instability;\r\narchbishop, nobles, gentry, artisans, and populace were all ready for a\r\ngeneral scrimmage on the slightest provocation. The clergy were numerous\r\nand very rich; sons of noblemen held the fat benefices, and almost all\r\nled irreligious lives and held celibacy in the meanest esteem. Simony\r\nwas the rule. In Hildebrand's time the passion for religious reform\r\nswept over the lower classes of the city. A new sect arose, the Patarini\r\n(ragamuffins), a species of Puritans, who took up the cry against\r\nclerical laxity and immorality, and denounced married priests. Religious\r\nexcitement set fire to social and economic discontent; populace and\r\nnobles flew to arms; there were riots and civil war. Several eminent\r\nmen, close friends of Hildebrand, became popular leaders; and the\r\ncontest of people and Patarini against nobles and married clergy became\r\nan episode in the general strife between Papal and Imperial parties.\r\nSimilar tumults, caused half by class enmity, half by the passion for\r\nreligious reform, took place in other northern cities, Cremona,\r\nPiacenza, Pavia, Padua; on one side was the party of aristocratic\r\nprivilege, looking to the Emperor for support; on the other, the party\r\nof the people, looking to the Pope.\r\n\r\nGregory's fourth ally was the rebellious nobility of Germany. Had\r\nGermany been united and loyal, the German king would easily have been\r\nable to assert his power in Italy; but Germany was disloyal and divided.\r\nArchbishops of the great archbishoprics, dukes of the great duchies,\r\nbishops, counts, and lords, in fact, all the component parts of the\r\nfeudal structure of Germany, were jealous of one another; each grudged\r\nthe other his possessions, and were in accord only in jealousy of the\r\nroyal power. There were always some barons or bishops thankful to have\r\nthe Pope's name and the Pope's aid in a rebellious design. These\r\nanimosities the Papacy through its thousand hands diligently fomented.\r\n\r\nRanged against Gregory and his allies were the loyal parts of Germany,\r\nthe Imperial adherents in Italy, the married clergy everywhere, and all\r\nwhom Gregory's reforms had angered and estranged. At their head was a\r\ndissipated young king, of high spirit, headstrong, ignorant, and\r\nsuperstitious, who entertained lofty notions of his royal and Imperial\r\nprerogatives. The characters of these two men would have brought them\r\ninto collision, even if the irreconcilable natures of Empire and Papacy\r\nhad not rendered a clash inevitable.\r\n\r\nGregory, almost immediately after his elevation to the pontificate, held\r\na council and denounced simony, marriage of the clergy, and lay\r\ninvestiture. The king, who believed in the existing system, continued to\r\nexercise what he deemed his royal rights with a view to improving his\r\npolitical position. Gregory held a second council and utterly forbade\r\nlay investiture. Henry continued to disobey. Then Gregory wrote to him\r\nthat he must renounce the claim of investiture, and humbly present\r\nhimself in person before the papal presence and beg absolution for his\r\nsins; or, if he should fail to obey, Gregory would excommunicate him.\r\nHenry and his party, now very angry, retorted by holding a German synod,\r\nwhich charged Gregory with all sorts of offences, moral, ecclesiastical,\r\nand political, absolved both king and bishops from their papal\r\nallegiance, and, finally, deposed the Pope. Henry himself wrote Gregory\r\nthis letter:--\r\n\r\n\"Henry, not by usurpation, but by God's holy will. King, to Hildebrand,\r\nno longer Pope, but false monk:--\r\n\r\n\"This greeting you have deserved from the confusion you have caused, for\r\nin every rank of the Church you have brought confusion instead of\r\nhonour, a curse instead of a blessing. Out of much I shall say but a\r\nlittle; you have not only not feared to touch the rulers of the Holy\r\nChurch, archbishops, bishops, priests, God's anointed, but as if they\r\nwere slaves, you have trampled them down under your feet. By trampling\r\nthem down you have got favour from the vulgar mouth. You have decided\r\nthat they know nothing, and that you alone know everything, and you have\r\nstudied to use your knowledge not to build up but to destroy.... We have\r\nborne all this and have striven to maintain the honour of the Apostolic\r\nSee. But you have construed our humility as fear, and for that reason\r\nyou have not feared to rise up against our royal power, and have even\r\ndared to threaten that you would take it from us; as if we had received\r\nour kingdom from you, as if kingdom and empire were in your hands and\r\nnot in God's. Our Lord Jesus Christ has called us to the kingdom, but\r\nnot you to the priesthood. You have mounted by these steps; by\r\ncraft--abominable in a monk--you have come into money, by money to\r\nfavour, by favour to the sword, by the sword to the seat of peace; and\r\nfrom the seat of peace you have confounded peace. You have armed\r\nsubjects against those over them; you, the unelect, have held our\r\nbishops, elect of God, up to contempt.... Me, even, who though unworthy\r\nam the anointed king, you have touched, and although the holy fathers\r\nhave taught that a king may be judged by God only, and for no offence\r\nexcept deviation from the faith--which God forbid--you have asserted\r\nthat I should be deposed; when even Julian the Apostate was left by the\r\nwisdom of the holy fathers to be judged and deposed by God only. That\r\ntrue Pope, blessed Peter, says: 'Fear God, honour the king.' But you do\r\nnot fear God and you dishonour me appointed by Him. And blessed Paul,\r\nwho did not spare an angel from heaven who should preach other doctrine,\r\ndid not except you, here on earth, who now teach other doctrine. For he\r\nsays, 'But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel\r\nunto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be\r\naccursed.' You therefore by Paul anathematized, by the judgment of all\r\nour bishops and by mine condemned, come down, leave the apostolic seat\r\nwhich you have usurped; let another mount the throne of blessed Peter,\r\nwho shall not cloak violence with religion, but shall teach the sound\r\ndoctrine of blessed Peter. I, Henry, King by God's grace, and all our\r\nbishops, say to you, Down, down, you damned forever.\"[9]\r\n\r\nTo the action of the German synod and to this letter there could be but\r\none answer. Gregory held a synod, excommunicated the king, and released\r\nhis subjects from their allegiance. The Germans rose in rebellion,\r\ntaking the excommunication as a ground or perhaps as a pretext; they\r\nheld a great council in presence of a papal legate, and decided that\r\nthey would renounce their allegiance unless the king obtained\r\nabsolution. The king, too weak to cope with the rebels, submitted. He\r\ncrossed the Alps with his wife and one or two servants, in midwinter,\r\nand came to the fortress of Canossa, near Parma, a stronghold belonging\r\nto the Countess Matilda, whither Gregory had gone. For three days the\r\nking stood outside the gates, dressed as a penitent, and begged for\r\nleave to present himself before the Pope. At last, owing to the\r\nentreaties of Matilda, the king was admitted. He cast himself upon the\r\nground before Gregory, who lifted him up and bade him submit to the\r\nordeal of the eucharist. Gregory took the consecrated wafer and said,\r\n\"If I am guilty of the crimes charged against me, may God strike me.\" He\r\nbroke and ate; then turning to Henry, said, \"Do thou, my son, as I have\r\ndone.\" The king did not dare to invoke the judgment of God; he humbled\r\nhimself, resigned his crown into Gregory's hands, and swore to remain a\r\nprivate person until he should be judged by a council. He was then\r\nabsolved (1077).\r\n\r\nVarious events followed this terrible humiliation. The German rebels set\r\nup an anti-king, and the king's men set up an anti-pope, and there was\r\nwar and hatred everywhere. The king's energy triumphed for a time; he\r\neven captured Rome, and had it not been for a Norman army, which came to\r\nthe Pope's rescue, he would have captured Gregory, too. But, despite\r\nroyal triumphs the scene at Canossa had struck the majesty of the Empire\r\nan irretrievable blow; the king of the Germans, Emperor except for a\r\ncoronation, had admitted in a most dramatic way, before all Europe, the\r\ninferiority of the temporal to the spiritual power.\r\n\r\nGregory died in exile at Salerno, Henry died deposed by his rebellious\r\nson; and the question of lay investiture still remained unsettled. More\r\ndeeds of violence were done, more oaths broken, more lives taken; at\r\nlast an agreement was reached and the long contest closed. Papacy and\r\nEmpire made a treaty of peace, known as the Concordat of Worms (1122).\r\nThe Emperor renounced all claim to invest bishops with ring and staff,\r\nand recognized the freedom of election and of ordination of the clergy,\r\nthus giving up all claim to appoint bishops and other ecclesiastical\r\ndignitaries. The Pope agreed that the election of bishops should take\r\nplace in presence of the Emperor or his representative, and that bishops\r\nshould receive their fiefs in a separate ceremony, by touch of the royal\r\nsceptre, in token of holding them from the Empire. This compromise,\r\nwhich seems absurdly simple, as settled questions often do, was a final\r\nadjustment of the immediate quarrel between Empire and Papacy, but left\r\nthe larger matter of mastery still to be fought out.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] _Select Mediaeval Documents_, Shailer Mathews, translated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTRADE AGAINST FEUDALISM (1152-1190)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter dealt with the struggle between the two great mediaeval\r\ninstitutions, the Empire and the Papacy. This deals with the contest\r\nbetween the Empire, representing the feudal system, and a new social\r\nforce, the spirit of trade, represented by the Lombard cities. Naturally\r\nthe Papacy joined in the fray and sided with the Lombard cities; and,\r\nbefore the end, all Italy was divided into two great parties designated\r\nby terms derived from Germany: Guelfs, which indicated those opposed to\r\nthe Empire, and Ghibellines, which indicated friends to the Empire. But\r\nthe particular issue here fought out was that between feudalism and\r\ntrade, and the triumph of trade indicates the close of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Frederick I (1152-90) of the great house of Hohenstaufen is\r\nthe hero of this period. He was a noble specimen of the knight of the\r\nMiddle Ages, such as Sir Walter Scott conceived a knight to be. He had a\r\nbright, open countenance, fair hair, that curled a little on his\r\nforehead, and a red beard (Barbarossa) which impressed the Italian\r\nimagination. Valiant, resolute, energetic, bountiful in almsgiving,\r\nattentive to religious duties, he was a kind friend and a stern enemy.\r\nTo his misfortune he was born too late; he belonged to a chivalric\r\ngeneration out of place in a world which had begun to deem buying and\r\nselling matters of greater consequence than chivalry and crusades. He\r\nthought himself entitled to all the Imperial rights that had been\r\nexercised by the Ottos; and, measuring his own prerogatives by their\r\nstandard, resolved to make good the deficiencies of his immediate\r\npredecessors, who for one reason or another had neglected to assert\r\nthose prerogatives in their plenitude. Barbarossa's situation may be\r\ncompared to that of Charles I of England, who believed himself lawful\r\nheir to all the prerogatives of the Tudors.\r\n\r\nOpposed to these old-fashioned views was the hard-headed spirit of\r\ncommercial Italy. Barbarossa's particular enemies were the Lombard\r\ncities, but that was because they were nearest to him. The same\r\nmercantile spirit animated all the cities of the peninsula; in fact, it\r\npervaded the maritime cities before it pervaded the Lombard cities, and\r\ncan best be described by means of a description of them.\r\n\r\nThe southern cities bloomed earlier than their northern sisters. Amalfi,\r\nnow a little fishing village which clings to the steep slopes of the\r\nGulf of Salerno, in the eleventh century was an independent republic of\r\n50,000 inhabitants. She traded with Sicily, Egypt, Syria, and Arabia;\r\nshe decked her women with the ornaments of the East; she built\r\nmonasteries at Jerusalem, also a hospital from which the Knights\r\nHospitallers of St. John took their name; she gave a maritime code to\r\nthe Mediterranean and Ionian seas, and circulated coin of her own\r\nminting throughout the Levant. Salerno, her near neighbour, had already\r\nbecome famous for her knowledge of medicine, acquired from the Arabs.\r\nThe speculations of her physicians upon the medicinal properties of\r\nherbs went all over Europe. She abounded in attractions. Vineyards,\r\napple orchards, nut trees, flourished round about the city; within there\r\nwere handsome palaces; \"the women did not lack beauty, nor the men\r\nhonesty.\" The Normans must have found themselves very comfortable.\r\nNaples, Gaeta, and the Greek cities of the heel and toe were also\r\nimportant and prosperous. But these southern cities were soon outdone by\r\ntheir sturdier northern rivals, Pisa, Genoa, Venice.\r\n\r\nPisa, which now lies at the mouth of the Arno like a forsaken mermaid on\r\nthe shore, is said to have been a free commune before the year 900. She\r\ntraded east and west; she waged wars with the Saracens, drove them from\r\nSardinia, captured the Balearic Islands (1114), and carried the war into\r\nAfrica. Rich with booty and commercial gains, she erected (according to\r\na traveller's estimate) ten thousand towers within the city walls,\r\ncompleted her dome-crowned, many-columned, queenly cathedral, and built\r\nthe attendant baptistery, within whose marble walls musical notes rise\r\nand fall, circle and swell, as if angels were singing in mid-air. She\r\nreceived many privileges from the Emperors; her maritime usages were to\r\nbe respected; she was to enact her own laws, and to judge her citizens.\r\nNo Imperial Marquess was to enter Tuscany until he had received approval\r\nfrom twelve men of Pisa, to be elected at a public meeting, called\r\ntogether by the city's bells (1085). She spread her power in the Levant.\r\nJaffa, Acre, Tripoli, Antioch were in great part under her dominion, and\r\nher factories were scattered along the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nFurther to the north, mounting hillward from her curving bay, lay Genoa\r\nthe Proud, who for a time was Pisa's ally against the Saracens, and then\r\nbecame her rival and enemy. Genoa, too, was devoted to commerce and\r\nestablished settlements in Constantinople, in the Crimea, in Cyprus and\r\nSyria, in Majorca and Tunis. She, too, had obtained from the Empire a\r\ncharter of municipal privileges and was a republic, free in all but\r\nname.\r\n\r\nVenice, their greater sister, first rivalled and then surpassed both\r\nPisa and Genoa. She traces her origin to the men who fled from the\r\nmainland in fear of Attila and sought refuge on the marshy islands of\r\nthe coast (452). In later days others fled before the Lombards, and\r\njoined the descendants of the earlier refugees. Here, under the nominal\r\ngovernment of the Eastern Empire, the Venetians gradually developed\r\nstrength and independence, and took into their own hands the election of\r\ntheir Doge (697). The city of the _Rivo Alto_, the Venice of to-day, was\r\nbegun about 800. Thirty years later the body of St. Mark the Evangelist\r\nwas brought from Alexandria, and the foundations of St. Mark's basilica\r\nwere laid over his bones. Politically Venice maintained her allegiance,\r\nshifting and time-serving though it was, true to Constantinople, not\r\nfrom sentiment, but because Constantinople was the first city in the\r\nworld, the centre of art, of luxury, of commerce. Indeed, Venice was\r\nlike a daughter or younger sister to Constantinople; all her old\r\nmonuments, her mosaics, her sculpture, her marble columns, show her\r\nByzantine inclinations. She took an active part in the Crusades,\r\nfurnished transports and supplies, and mixed religion, war, and commerce\r\nin one profitable whole.\r\n\r\nThese maritime cities constantly fought one another; Pisa destroyed\r\nAmalfi, Genoa ruined Pisa, and Venice finally crippled Genoa. The glory\r\nthey won was by individual effort; whereas the glory of the Lombard\r\ncities is that they effected a union, tardy indeed and imperfect, but\r\nsuccessful at last in its purpose of enforcing their liberties against\r\nthe Imperial claims. These Lombard cities included in their respective\r\ndominions the country round about, and were, in fact, except for a\r\nnegligent Imperial control, little independent republics. It has been a\r\nmatter of long dispute whether these communes were survivals from old\r\nRoman times, or sprung from the love of independence brought in by the\r\nTeutonic invaders; whatever their origin they virtually began with\r\ntrade, rested upon trade, and flourished with trade. This trade, which,\r\nbeginning between neighbouring cities, extended northward over the Alps,\r\nwas greatly aided by the maritime cities. Ships called for cargoes. The\r\nstimulus imparted by the energy of Venetian, Genoese, and Pisan seamen\r\nto manufactures and transalpine trade was felt in every Lombard city.\r\nFor instance, the Venetians, eager to carry a wider range of merchandise\r\nover sea to Alexandria or Jaffa, held fairs in the inland cities,\r\nexposed the wares they had fetched home, and stirred mercantile\r\nindustry. A burgher class of traders and artisans grew up. Men met in\r\nthe market-place, talked business, considered ways and means, discussed\r\nthe conditions of production and exchange, and became a shrewd, capable\r\nclass. The moment business expanded beyond the city walls, it bumped\r\ninto feudal rights at every corner; at every crossroad it found itself\r\nenmeshed in feudal prerogatives and privileges. Trade could not endure a\r\nsystem fitted only for a farming community. Trade took men into\r\npolitics; and in those days politics meant war. The citizens of Milan,\r\nPavia, and neighbouring cities were not wholly unused to civic rights,\r\nfor they had long had a voice in the election of bishops, and they had\r\ntheir trade guilds. These rights they enlarged whenever they got a\r\nchance; and chances came frequently in the quarrels between Emperor and\r\narchbishop, or between the greater and lesser nobility. Both sides\r\nwanted their support; and they sold it in exchange for privileges, here\r\na little, there a little, and obtained many concessions. Finally, after\r\nthe burghers had advanced in wealth and social consideration, the petty\r\nnobles made common cause with them; and the two combined succeeded in\r\nforcing the great lords to join also, and make one general civic union.\r\nThese great lords, who had been little tyrants in the country\r\nroundabout, were compelled to live within the city walls for part of the\r\nyear and be hostages for their own good behaviour, and were thus\r\nconverted from enemies into leading citizens. The consequence of these\r\nchanges was that the former government by a bishop, which in course of\r\ntime had supplanted the old Carlovingian system of government by a\r\ncount, was superseded in its turn by a much more popular form of\r\ngovernment. The bishop's authority was narrowly limited, the executive\r\npower was lodged in consuls, two or more, who were elected annually, and\r\nthe legislative power was placed in a general council of the burghers\r\n(in Milan not more than fifteen hundred men), and in a small inner\r\ncouncil, which represented the aristocratic element. By Barbarossa's\r\ntime the government of the cities had ceased to be feudal, and had\r\nbecome communal. There was inevitable antagonism between Lombardy and\r\nthe Holy Roman Empire. The league of Lombard cities embodied the revolt\r\nof trade against the feudal system, of merchants against uncertain and\r\nexcessive taxes, of burghers against foreign princes, in short, general\r\ndiscontent with an outgrown political system.\r\n\r\nBarbarossa's war with the Lombard cities lasted for twenty-five years,\r\nand for convenience may be divided into two periods,--the period before\r\nthe cities had learnt the lesson of union and the period after. So long\r\nas they were divided by mutual distrust and jealousy, Barbarossa was\r\nvictorious; when they were united they conquered him.\r\n\r\nBarbarossa made his first expedition across the Alps in answer to\r\nappeals that had been made to him from various parts of Italy. Como and\r\nLodi complained of Milan; the Popes complained of the insubordinate\r\nRomans, who had set up a republic and were going crazy over an heretical\r\nrepublican priest, one Arnold of Brescia; the lord of the little city\r\nof Capua complained of the Norman king. Barbarossa, with his lofty\r\nnotions of Imperial authority and Imperial duty, gathered together an\r\narmy and descended into Italy to settle all troubles. He began by\r\nissuing orders to Milan with regard to her conduct towards Como and\r\nLodi. Milan shut her gates. The proud city and the proud Emperor were at\r\nswords' points in a moment. A letter from Barbarossa from his camp near\r\nMilan, written to his uncle, Otto of Freysing, briefly narrates the\r\ncircumstances: \"The Milanese, tricky and proud, came to meet us with a\r\nthousand disloyal excuses and reasons, and offered us great sums of\r\nmoney if we would grant them sovereignty over Como and Lodi; and\r\nbecause, without letting ourselves be swayed one jot by their prayers or\r\nby their offers, we marched into their territory, they kept us away from\r\ntheir rich lands and made us pass three whole days in the midst of a\r\ndesert; until at last, against their wish, we pitched our camp one mile\r\nfrom Milan. Here, after they had refused provisions for which we had\r\noffered to pay, we took possession of one of their finest castles,\r\ndefended by five hundred horsemen, and reduced it to ashes; and our\r\ncavalry advanced to the gates of Milan and killed many Milanese and took\r\nmany prisoners. Then open war broke out between us. When we crossed the\r\nriver Ticino in order to go to Novara, we captured two bridges which\r\nthey had fortified with castles, and after the army had crossed,\r\ndestroyed them. Then we dismantled three of their fortresses ... and\r\nafter we had celebrated Christmas with great merriment, we marched by\r\nway of Vercelli and Turin to the Po; we crossed the river and destroyed\r\nthe strong city of Chieri, and burned Asti. This done, we laid siege to\r\nTortona, most strongly fortified both by art and nature; and on the\r\nthird day, having captured the suburbs, we should easily have carried\r\nthe citadel, if night and stormy weather had not prevented us. At last,\r\nafter many assaults, many killed, and a piteous slaughter of citizens,\r\nwe forced the citadel to surrender, not without losing a number of our\r\nmen.\"[10]\r\n\r\nSuch vigour as this reduced Milan and her sister cities to obedience.\r\nBut Frederick was not content with raids into Italy and spasmodic\r\npunishment administered to this rebellious city or to that; he wished to\r\nhave the Imperial rights and authority definitely settled on a permanent\r\nbasis; so he convoked a diet on the plain of Roncaglia, not far from\r\nPiacenza, to which he summoned bishops, dukes, marquesses, counts, and\r\nother nobles of the realm, four famous jurists from Bologna, and two\r\nrepresentatives from each of fourteen Lombard cities. Frederick was a\r\njust man; he merely wished his legal rights, and proposed to ascertain\r\nwhat those rights were. The determination was left to the lawyers.\r\n\r\nBy this time lawyers had already begun to play a part in public affairs.\r\nRoman law had never been lost. For centuries it had remained side by\r\nside with the customs of the conquering Barbarians, less as a code of\r\nlaws than as the tradition of the subject Latin people; and, when the\r\nneeds of quickening civilization required a more elaborate system of law\r\nthan custom could supply, there was the Roman law ready for use. It\r\nsuddenly leaped into general interest, and rivalled the Church as a\r\ncareer for young men. St. Bernard complained that the law of Justinian\r\nwas ousting the law of God. In 1088 the great law school of Bologna had\r\nbeen founded. Thither students crowded by thousands; and the opinions of\r\nits jurists were received with the deepest respect.\r\n\r\nAt Roncaglia the body of lawyers appointed to determine Imperial rights,\r\ndecided, doubtless in accordance with Barbarossa's expectation, in\r\nfavour of the Imperial side. The feudal nobles were delighted. The\r\narchbishop of Milan, the recognized head of the Lombard nobility, said\r\nto the Emperor: \"Know that every right in the people to make laws has\r\nbeen granted to you; your will is law, as it is said, _Quod Principi\r\nplacuit legis habet vigorem_ [The Emperor's will has the force of law],\r\nsince the people have granted to you all authority and sovereignty.\" In\r\naccordance with the spirit of this principle, the _regalia_, tolls,\r\ntaxes, forfeits, and exactions of various kinds, were defined, and the\r\nright to appoint the executive magistrates in the communes adjudged to\r\nthe Emperor. In substance the decision of the jurists was the\r\nrestoration of the Imperial rights as they had been under the Ottos,\r\nwhen the communes were in their infancy.\r\n\r\nFrederick's legal triumph was complete, but such a decision could only\r\nbe sustained by force. The cities would not accept it; they preferred\r\nwar. In the course of one campaign Milan was razed to the ground (1162),\r\nso literally, that Frederick dated his letters _post destructionem\r\nMediolani_, \"after the destruction of Milan.\" But the cities at last\r\nlearned the necessity of union and stood shoulder to shoulder. The\r\nPapacy, too, which had been friendly to the Emperor during the\r\ninsurrections in Rome, turned round and joined the cities against him,\r\nand Frederick, in retaliation, set up an anti-pope. Nevertheless, the\r\nglory of defeating the Emperor belongs to the cities, and not to the\r\nPapacy. The decisive battle was fought near Milan on the field of\r\nLegnano (1176).\r\n\r\nThe arbitrament of the sword reversed the decision of the lawyers at\r\nRoncaglia. Frederick frankly accepted defeat. A ceremonious conference\r\nwas held at Venice. At the portal of St. Mark's, Pope Alexander III, no\r\nunworthy successor to Hildebrand, raised up the kneeling Emperor and\r\ngave him the kiss of peace. Temporary terms were agreed on, and a few\r\nyears later the Peace of Constance (1183) definitely closed the war. The\r\nEmperor relinquished all but nominal rights of sovereignty over the\r\nconfederate cities. They were to elect their municipal officers, and,\r\nwith comparatively unimportant exceptions, to administer justice and\r\nmanage their own affairs. Trade had conquered feudalism. The Middle Ages\r\nwere near their setting.\r\n\r\nNo more of Barbarossa's doings need here be chronicled, except what he\r\ndeemed a brilliant stroke of diplomacy, by which he hoped to unite the\r\ncrown of the Two Sicilies with the Imperial crown on the head of his\r\nson, Henry, and through him on the heads of a long line of\r\nHohenstaufens. The Empire had always asserted a claim to Southern Italy,\r\nbut its claim had never been made good except during the temporary\r\noccupation of an Imperial army; and since the Normans had established\r\ntheir kingdom, Southern Italy had not only been lost to the Empire, but\r\nhad become the chief prop of the Empire's enemy, the Papacy. If the\r\nEmpire could acquire Southern Italy, it would hem in the Papacy both\r\nsouth and north, and crush it to obedience. Frederick's son Henry was\r\nmarried to the heiress of the Norman kingdom (1186); and the good\r\nEmperor, happy in the prospect before his Imperial line, but happier in\r\nthat he could not foresee truly, took the cross and led his army towards\r\nthe Holy Land. He died on the way (1190), leaving behind him a\r\nreputation for honour and chivalry, inferior to none left by the German\r\nEmperors.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] _Storia d'Italia_, Cappelletti, pp. 99, 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTRIUMPH OF THE PAPACY (1198-1216)\r\n\r\n\r\nGregory VII was well named the Julius Caesar of the Papacy. His great\r\nconception of a sovereign ecclesiastical power, supreme over Europe, was\r\ndestined to be realized. For in the fulness of time came Innocent III,\r\nthe Augustus Caesar of the Papacy, who ruled the civilized world of\r\nEurope more after the fashion of the old Roman Emperors than any one,\r\nexcept Charlemagne, had done. But in the interval between these two\r\nfamous Popes, there was a period of reaction in which it looked for a\r\ntime as if the Empire would plant the Ghibelline flag on the papal\r\ncitadel. The Popes of this period were men of no marked ability, whereas\r\nthe young king, Henry VI, had inherited the forceful temper of\r\nBarbarossa as well as his theories of Imperial rights, and displayed\r\ngreat vigour, energy, and resolution. Despite the opposition of the\r\nPopes, who as feudal suzerains of Sicily were most averse to the\r\nalliance, he had married the heiress of the Norman line, and despite the\r\nfierce opposition of the Sicilians,--part Arabs, part Greeks, with\r\nItalians and Normans mingling in,--he established his authority in the\r\nisland. Henry was horribly cruel, but he was efficient. He was King of\r\nGermany, King of Italy, and King of the Two Sicilies, and had compelled\r\na reluctant Pope to crown him Emperor. He determined to be Emperor in\r\nItaly in fact, and to accomplish what his father had failed to do. He\r\nundertook to check and suppress the communes by reviving the old feudal\r\nsystem. He reinstated old duchies and counties, and enfeoffed his loyal\r\nGermans. Matters looked black for the Guelfs, when, to their great good\r\nluck, the fiery young Emperor died, leaving an incompetent widow and a\r\nhelpless baby (1197). By one of those occurrences, in which Catholics\r\nsee more than the hand of chance, in the very year after the Emperor's\r\ndeath, a man of political talents of the highest order was elected to\r\nthe pontifical chair.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Pope Alexander III, the great antagonist of Frederick\r\nBarbarossa, a young nobleman, who took holy orders almost in boyhood,\r\nhad given early promise of an extraordinary career. This handsome,\r\neloquent, imperious boy, named Lothair, inherited through his father,\r\nThrasmund of the Counts of Segni in Latium, the fierce impetuosity of\r\nthe Lombards, and through his mother, a Roman lady of high birth (from\r\nwhom he took his master traits), the tenacity, the adroitness, the\r\npolitical genius of the Romans. He was educated at the universities of\r\nBologna and Paris, where he studied law, theology, and scholastic\r\nphilosophy. The stormy period of the struggle between Alexander and\r\nBarbarossa brought character and talents quickly to the front. Before he\r\nwas twenty he had distinguished himself, before he was thirty he had\r\nbeen made a cardinal, and at thirty-seven he was elected Pope. According\r\nto the practice instituted by the deposed scamp, John XII, of taking a\r\nnew name, Lothair assumed the title of Innocent III.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidance of Innocent III (1198-1216), the Papacy attained the\r\nfull meridian of its glory. When this great Pope, lawyer, theologian,\r\nstatesman, came to the throne, it was demoralized and weak; before he\r\ndied, it had set its yoke on the neck of Europe. For the second time in\r\nhistory, orders were issued from Rome to the whole civilized world. A\r\nreview of his pontificate brings up a panorama of Europe. His task began\r\nin Rome. This little city of churches, monasteries, towers, and ruins,\r\nwhich took no pride in great papal affairs, had plunged into one of its\r\nfits of republican independence, and, supported by the Emperor, had\r\nousted the Popes from all control. In the course of a few years, by\r\nintrigue, tact, and civil war, Innocent got into his own hands the\r\nappointment of the senate and of the city governor, and thereby control\r\nof the city. He next turned his attention to the Patrimony of St. Peter,\r\nthat central strip from Rome to Ravenna, given or supposed to have been\r\ngiven by Pippin and Charlemagne to the successors of St. Peter. Here the\r\nimpetuous Emperor, Henry VI, had seated his German barons, setting up\r\nfiefs for them, and reestablishing the feudal system under the Imperial\r\nsuzerainty. These German barons were hated by the people. Innocent put\r\nhimself at the head of the popular discontent, organized a Guelf, almost\r\na national, party, and either drove the Germans out, or forced them to\r\nswear allegiance to the Holy See.\r\n\r\nIn Tuscany also the Guelfs were successful in breaking up the feudal\r\nrestoration. In fact, since the days of Countess Matilda feudalism had\r\nbeen doomed. The cities had taken advantage of the wars between Papacy\r\nand Empire to secure virtual independence; and on Henry's death, with\r\nthe exception of Ghibelline Pisa, they banded together and agreed never\r\nto admit an Imperial governor within their territories. Innocent tried\r\nto bring these cities under papal dominion, but they were too\r\nindependent, and he was obliged to rest content with snapping up\r\nscattered portions of Matilda's domains.\r\n\r\nMeantime in the kingdom of the Two Sicilies the Emperor's widow had\r\ndied, and left to Innocent's guardianship her little son, Frederick.\r\nInnocent, guardian and suzerain lord, immediately began a struggle with\r\nthe feudal nobility, just as in Italy, and, after a long and difficult\r\ncontest, asserted the authority of his royal ward. On the termination of\r\nthe minority, he handed over the kingdom to Frederick, who, on his part\r\nas King of the Two Sicilies, swore fealty to the Pope. Had it not been\r\nfor his honourable and powerful guardian, Frederick probably would have\r\nhad no kingdom, and in his oath of fealty he acknowledged his\r\nindebtedness: \"Among all the wishes which we carry in the front rank of\r\nour desires, this is the chief, to discharge a grateful obedience, to\r\nshow an honourable devotion, and never to be found ungrateful for your\r\nbenefits--God forbid--since, next to Divine Grace, to your protection we\r\nare indebted not only for land but also for life.\"\r\n\r\nIn this way Innocent established the Papacy in Italy; sovereign,\r\nsuzerain, protector or ally, he was the head of the Italian Guelfs and\r\npractically of Italy. Let us now look abroad. In Constantinople, the\r\ncapital of the Greek Empire, Innocent's legate bestowed the Imperial\r\npurple upon an Emperor. An odd whirl of Fortune's wheel brought this to\r\npass. Innocent had preached a crusade in the hope of recovering the Holy\r\nLand from the infidels, who had succeeded in expelling the Christians.\r\nAn army of Frenchmen and Flemings answered his summons. They determined\r\nto avoid the deadly route overland and go by sea, and applied to Venice\r\nfor transportation. When they came to pay the bill they did not have the\r\nmoney, and the Venetians insisted that they should help them recapture\r\nthe city of Zara, on the Dalmatian coast, which had once belonged to\r\nVenice but had been lost again. Zara was attacked and taken (1202). One\r\ndeflection from the straight path of duty led to another. To Zara came\r\nthe son of the Greek Emperor to say that his father had been deposed,\r\nand to beg for help. The Venetians, wishing to wound two commercial\r\nrivals at once, Constantinople and Pisa (for the usurping Emperor\r\nfavoured Pisa), used the suppliant as a stalking-horse, and persuaded\r\nthe Crusaders once again to divert their immediate purpose and to\r\nrestore the deposed Emperor to his throne. Again the Crusaders listened\r\nto temptation, for the Venetians baited their hook with golden promises;\r\nthey sailed to Constantinople and restored the wronged Emperor. Matters\r\ndid not go smoothly, however. Misunderstanding with the Greeks led to\r\ndisagreements, disagreements to quarrels, and quarrels to war. The Latin\r\nCrusaders assaulted Constantinople, carried it by storm, and plundered\r\nhouses, palaces, churches, shrines, everything; then, with appetites\r\nwhetted by petty spoils, seized the frail Empire itself (1204). They\r\ndivided Thrace, Macedonia, Greece, the islands of the AEgean Sea, and all\r\nthe remnants of the Roman Empire of the East that they could lay hands\r\non. Pious Venice came out best; she took coast and island, town and\r\ncountry, all along from recaptured Zara round by the shores of Dalmatia,\r\nAlbania, Peloponnesus, and Thessaly, ending with half of Constantinople\r\nitself. The Marquess of Monferrat became King of Thessalonica, and his\r\nvassal, a Burgundian count, was invested with the lordship of Athens and\r\nThebes. The Count of Flanders was elected Emperor of a Latin Empire.\r\nInnocent had been very angry with the deflections to Zara and\r\nConstantinople, and had thundered against the polite but inflexible\r\nVenetians. When the evil had been done, however, he made the best of it,\r\nand behaved with dignity and astuteness. He rebuked the Crusaders for\r\nhaving preferred the things of earth to those of Heaven, and bade them\r\nask God's pardon for the profanation of holy places; but he admitted the\r\nadvantage that would arise from reconciling the Greeks, schismatics\r\nsince the days of Leo the Iconoclast, with the Roman See. So his legate\r\nbestowed the purple on a suppliant Emperor in the city of\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\nIn Germany Innocent also appears as the giver and withholder of crowns.\r\nOn the death of Henry VI there was a disputed election. The Hohenstaufen\r\nparty, dreading a long minority, passed over the baby Frederick, and\r\nnominated Philip, Henry's brother; the rival party, the German Guelfs,\r\nnominated Otto of Brunswick, a nephew of Richard Coeur-de-lion. Civil\r\nwar followed, and both parties appealed to Innocent who, after\r\ndeliberation, supported Otto, but exacted a high price. Otto was obliged\r\nto guarantee to the Pope the strip of territory from Rome to Ravenna,\r\nand those portions of Matilda's domains which were not fiefs of the\r\nEmpire, also to acknowledge papal suzerainty over the Two Sicilies, and\r\nto promise to conform to the papal will with regard to the leagues of\r\nthe Lombard and Tuscan cities. This guarantee of Otto laid the first\r\nreal foundation of the Papal States. Hitherto, vague _Donations_ had\r\ngiven pretexts for claims; but Otto's deed was a definite Imperial\r\ngrant, and conveyed an unquestionable title. In spite of Innocent's\r\nsupport matters went ill for Otto in Germany. Philip's star rose, and\r\nInnocent, to whom the cause of the Papacy was the cause of God and\r\njustified diplomatic conduct, was on the point of shifting to Philip's\r\nside, when in the nick of time Philip was murdered (1208). Otto's claim\r\nwas now undisputed. No sooner, however, did he feel the crown secure on\r\nhis head than he shifted his ground. Guelf by birth though he was, he\r\nfound that he could not be both obedient to the Pope and loyal to his\r\nImperial duties. He turned into a complete Ghibelline, broke his grant\r\nto the Pope, attempted to restore the feudal system in the papal\r\nterritories, and assumed to treat the Two Sicilies as a fief of the\r\nEmpire. Innocent, outraged and indignant at this breach of faith,\r\nexcommunicated him (1210). Thereupon, as at the time when Gregory VII\r\nexcommunicated Henry IV, the German barons rose, deposed Otto, and\r\nsummoned young Frederick from Sicily to take the German crown. Innocent\r\nsupported Frederick's cause, but exacted the price which he had formerly\r\nexacted from the perjured Otto. Frederick, pressed by present need, and\r\nforgetful of Otto's evil precedent, pledged himself as follows: \"We,\r\nFrederick the Second, by Divine favour and mercy, King of the Romans,\r\never Augustus, and King of Sicily ... recognizing the grace given to us\r\nby God, we have also before our eyes the immense and innumerable\r\nbenefits rendered by you, most dear lord and reverend father, our\r\nprotector and benefactor, lord Innocent, by God's grace most venerable\r\nPontiff; through your benefaction, labour, and guardianship, we have\r\nbeen brought up, cherished, and advanced, ever since our mother, the\r\nEmpress Constance of happy memory, threw us upon your care, almost from\r\nbirth. To you, most blessed father, and to all your Catholic successors,\r\nand to the Holy Roman Church, our special mother, we shall discharge all\r\nobedience, honour, and reverence, always with an humble heart and a\r\ndevout spirit, as our Catholic predecessors, kings and Emperors, are\r\nknown to have done to your predecessors; not a whit from these shall we\r\ntake away, rather add, that our devotion may shine the more.\"[11]\r\nFrederick promised that he would not interfere in the election of\r\nbishops, and that the candidate canonically elected should be installed.\r\nHe confirmed the papal title to the Papal States. \"I vow, promise,\r\nswear, and take my oath to protect and preserve all the possessions,\r\nhonours, and rights of the Roman Church, in good faith, to the best of\r\nmy power\" (1213).\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward Frederick advanced from success to success. Otto\r\nwas driven into private life, and the Pope's legate put the German crown\r\non Frederick's head at Aachen (1215). Where Innocent blessed, success\r\nand prosperity followed; where he cursed, death and destruction came.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the Pope was equally triumphant. All Europe bent under his\r\nimperial decrees. The kings of Portugal, Leon, Castile, and Navarre were\r\nscolded or punished. The King of Aragon went to Rome and swore\r\nallegiance. The Duke of Bohemia was rebuked, the King of Denmark\r\ncomforted, the nobles of Iceland warned, the King of Hungary admonished.\r\nServia, Bulgaria, even remote Armenia, received papal supervision and\r\npaternal care. Philip Augustus of France, at Innocent's command, took\r\nback the wife whom he had repudiated. John of England grovelled on the\r\nground before him, and yielded up \"to our lord the Pope Innocent and his\r\nsuccessors, all our kingdom of England and all our kingdom of Ireland to\r\nbe held as a fief of the Holy See\"(1213).\r\n\r\nAnother triumph of darker hue added to the brilliance of Innocent's\r\ncareer. In the south of France, in the pleasant places of Provence and\r\nLanguedoc, where troubadours praised love and war, and lords and ladies\r\nwandered down primrose paths, the humbler folk got hold of certain\r\ndangerous ideas. They believed that there was a power of evil as well as\r\na power of good, that Christ was but an emanation from God, that the God\r\nof the Jews was not the real God of Goodness, and, worse than all, that\r\nthe Roman Church, with its sacerdotalism, forms, sacraments, and ritual,\r\nwas, to say the least, not what it should be. Innocent entertained no\r\ndoubts that the Roman Church had been founded by God to maintain His\r\ntruth on earth; as a statesman he regarded heresy as we regard treason\r\nand anarchy; as a priest he deemed it sin. He called Simon of Montfort\r\nand other dogs of war from the north and urged them at the quarry. The\r\nheresy was put down in blood. Here appears the black figure of St.\r\nDominic, encouraging the faithful, rallying the hesitant, and by the\r\nfervour of his belief, by his devotion, by his genius for organization,\r\nmore destructive to heresy than the sword of Montfort.\r\n\r\nThus Innocent sat supreme. He had created a papal kingdom where his\r\npredecessors had asserted impotent claims; he had confirmed the Two\r\nSicilies in their dependency upon the Holy See; he had put the Papacy at\r\nthe head of the Guelf party in Italy, and had made that party almost\r\nnational; he had enforced the power of the Church throughout Europe, had\r\ngiven crowns to the Kings of Aragon and of England, to the Emperors of\r\nGermany and of Constantinople. No such spectacle had been seen since the\r\nreign of Charlemagne; none such was to be seen again till the coming of\r\nNapoleon. The conception of Europe as an ecclesiastical organization had\r\nreached its fullest expression.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] _Select Mediaeval Documents_, Mathews, p. 115, translated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nST. FRANCIS (1182-1226)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the dazzling success achieved by Innocent, matters were not\r\nwell with the Church in Italy. Corruption threatened it from within,\r\nheresy from without. Simony was rampant; livings were almost put up at\r\nauction. Innocent asserted that there was no cure but fire and steel.\r\nThe prelates of the Roman Curia were \"tricky as foxes, proud as bulls,\r\ngreedy and insatiable as the Minotaur.\" The priests were often\r\nshameless; some became usurers to get money for their bastards, others\r\nkept taverns and sold wine. Worship had become a vain repetition of\r\nformulas. The monks were superstitious, many of them disreputable. The\r\ninevitable consequence of this decay in the Church was heresy. Italy was\r\nnearly, if not quite, as badly honeycombed with heretics as Languedoc\r\nhad been. The Patarini, whom we remember in Hildebrand's time, now\r\nbecome a species of heretics, abounded in Milan; other sects sprang up\r\nin towns near by. In Ferrara, Verona, Rimini, Faenza, Treviso, Florence,\r\nPrato, anti-sacerdotal sentiment was very strong. In Viterbo the\r\nheretics were numerous enough to elect their consul. At Piacenza priests\r\nhad been driven out, and the city left unshepherded for three years. In\r\nOrvieto there had been grave disorders. In Assisi a heretic had been\r\nelected _podesta_ (governor).\r\n\r\nThe great Innocent knitted his brows; he knew well that his noisy\r\ntriumphs, which echoed over the Tagus, the Thames, the Rhine, and the\r\nGolden Horn, were of no avail, if heretics sapped and mined the Church\r\nwithin. It seemed as if the great ecclesiastical fabric, to which he had\r\ngiven the devotion of a life, was tottering from corner-stone to apex;\r\nwhen, one day, a cardinal came to him and said, \"I have found a most\r\nperfect man, who wishes to live according to the Holy Gospel, and to\r\nobserve evangelical perfection in all things. I believe that through him\r\nthe Lord intends to reform His Holy Church in all the world.\" Innocent\r\nwas interested, and bade the man be brought before him. This man was\r\nFrancis Bernadone, known to us as St. Francis, the leader of a small\r\nband of Umbrian pilgrims from Assisi, who asked permission to follow\r\nliterally the example of Jesus Christ. The Pope hesitated. To the\r\ncardinals, men of the world, this young man and his pilgrims were fools\r\nand their faith nonsense. \"But,\" argued a believer, \"if you assert that\r\nit is novel, irrational, impossible to observe the perfection of the\r\nGospel, and to take a vow to do so, are you not guilty of blasphemy\r\nagainst Christ, the author of the Gospel?\" Thinking the matter over, the\r\nPope dreamed a dream. He beheld the Church of St. John Lateran, the\r\nepiscopal church of the bishops of Rome, leaning in ruin and about to\r\nfall, when a monk, poor and mean in appearance, bent under it and\r\npropped it with his back. Innocent awoke and said to himself, \"This\r\nFrancis is the holy monk by whose help the Church of God shall be lifted\r\nup and stand again.\" So he said to Francis and his followers, \"Go\r\nbrethren, God be with you. Preach repentance to all as He shall give you\r\ninspiration. And when Almighty God shall have made you multiply in\r\nnumbers and in grace, come back to us, and we will entrust you with\r\ngreater things.\"\r\n\r\nSo St. Francis, \"true servant of God and faithful follower of Jesus\r\nChrist,\" went about his ministry with the blessing of the Church. To the\r\npeople of Assisi, of Umbria, and afterwards of all Central Italy, his\r\nlife was a revelation of Christianity. He imparted the gospel anew, as\r\nfresh as when it had first been given under the Syrian stars. He\r\nembodied peace, gentleness, courtesy, and self-sacrifice. It is not too\r\nmuch to say that he saved the Catholic Church, and put off the\r\nProtestant Reformation for three hundred years. His example and\r\ninfluence raised the standard of conduct within the Church; and his\r\nlove, his devotion, his insistence on the essential parts of Christ's\r\nteaching, and his dislike of worldly pomps, deprived heresy of all its\r\nweapons. He satisfied the widespread religious hunger better than heresy\r\ndid. He was so characteristically Italian, and his ministry throws so\r\nmuch light on the state of Italy at the opening of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, that it is worth while to dwell for a few pages on his doings.\r\n\r\nAssisi, built for safety on a hill and protected by great walls and\r\ngates, was a good example of a little mediaeval town. In the centre was\r\nthe _piazza_, on which fronted a Roman temple to Minerva, haughtily\r\nscornful of its mediaeval surroundings. Hard by was the cathedral, where\r\nevery baby was taken for baptism. On the tiptop of the hill stood a huge\r\ncastle, where the feudal baron dwelt with his ruffianly soldiers and\r\nreceived his feudal lord, the Emperor, when he stopped at Assisi on his\r\nway to Rome. In Francis's boyhood, the people, aided by Pope Innocent,\r\nhad driven out the German count, and had formed themselves into a free\r\ncommune, save for their allegiance to the Holy See; but the change was\r\nnot all gain. The town was divided into discordant classes; the\r\nnobility, maintained in idleness by the produce of their estates, the\r\nbourgeoisie, engaged in trade (Francis's father was a merchant), the\r\nartisans grouped in guilds, and the serfs, who tilled the fields and\r\ntended the vineyards and olive orchards. Once rid of the German count,\r\nthe bourgeoisie endeavoured to rid themselves of the arrogant and idle\r\nnobility. Street war broke out. The nobles fled to Perugia, another\r\nlittle town perched on a hill some dozen miles across the plain, and\r\nasked for help. Perugia rejoiced in the opportunity. The miseries of a\r\npetty war between two little neighbours need no description. Fields and\r\nvineyards were devastated, olive orchards destroyed, farm-houses burned.\r\nEven in peace the peasants around Assisi lived in constant disquiet,\r\nready to fling down their mattocks and flee to the protection of the\r\ncity walls.\r\n\r\nWithin the city the streets were narrow, the houses small. Dirt\r\nabounded. War brought poverty, dirt brought the pest, Crusaders brought\r\nleprosy. At the gates of the town stood lazar-houses, and in remote\r\nspots lepers in the earlier stages of disease gathered together. Yet,\r\ndespite war, pest, and leprosy, life in Umbria could never have been\r\nwholly sad. Certainly the sons of the well-to-do enjoyed themselves and\r\nwhiled away the time carelessly. Sometimes a great personage stopped on\r\nhis Romeward way; sometimes strolling players exhibited their shows on\r\nthe _piazza_ before the Temple of Minerva; sometimes a troubadour,\r\nescaped from the persecution in Provence, passed by on his way to\r\nSicily, and sang his songs to repay hospitality. Many an afternoon and\r\nnight the clubs of young gentlemen gave _fetes champetres_ and dances.\r\nFrancis, as a boy, was gayest of the gay, dancing and piping in the\r\nmarket-place, fighting in the front rank against the nobles of Perugia,\r\nbut when he grew to manhood he could not bear the contrast between mirth\r\nand misery. He sought for some universal joy and found it in the love of\r\nChrist. He gathered about him a scanty band of holy and humble men of\r\nheart, who took the vow of poverty, and devoted themselves to praising\r\nGod, comforting the wretched, and tending lepers. The abbot of the\r\nneighbouring Benedictine monastery gave them a little chapel, where St.\r\nBenedict himself had once said mass, which lay in the plain a mile below\r\nthe town. This little chapel, named the _Portiuncula_ (the little\r\nportion), which is now covered by the great church of _Santa Maria degli\r\nAngeli_ (St. Mary of the Angels), so called because the songs of angels\r\nwere heard there, was the cradle of the Franciscan Order. It was a tiny\r\nbuilding, twenty feet wide and thirty long, with a steep pitched roof,\r\nplain walls, and big, round-arched door, and was sadly dilapidated. St.\r\nFrancis and his friends built it up, and it became their church. Round\r\nit they built their huts, and encompassed all with a hedge. Here it was\r\nthat St. Clare, the daughter of a nobleman of Assisi, donned the nun's\r\ndress. Here Francis passed the happy years of his life, while as yet his\r\ndisciples were few and all were animated by his passionate longing for\r\nself-abnegation. He followed the New Testament literally,\r\nsuperstitiously one would say were it not that this literal obedience\r\nwas accompanied by ineffable peace of heart and joy. He specially\r\nenjoined poverty. A smock, a cord, and sandals were enough for a true\r\nbrother. Once a novice begged for permission to own a psalter, and\r\nteased him, but Francis answered: \"After you have the psalter you will\r\ncovet and long for a breviary; and when you possess a breviary you will\r\nsit on a chair like a great prelate, and say to thy brother, fetch me my\r\nbreviary.\" Nor would he suffer the brethren to take heed for the morrow.\r\nThey were only allowed to ask for provisions sufficient for the day. For\r\nhe, in the rapture of his love, found infinite pleasure in the literal\r\nfulfillment of every word that had fallen from Christ's lips. Francis\r\nwas an orator; he possessed passion, the great source of eloquence, and\r\nstirred prelates and Crusaders as well as peasants and lepers. The world\r\nwished for sympathy and he gave it. He seemed to be sick with the sick,\r\nafflicted with those in affliction, holy with the good; and even sinners\r\nfelt him one of themselves. To his disciples he was Jesus come again.\r\nJoy and happiness radiated from him. All the world felt the charm and\r\nbeauty of his love of God, and poetry followed him as wild violets\r\nattend the spring.\r\n\r\nThus Francis, by rubbing off the incrustations of twelve hundred\r\nunchristian years, revealed the poetry of the gospel to an eager world.\r\nOne charming trait of his character was his love of animals, especially\r\nof birds. He wished the ox and the ass, companions of the manger, to\r\nshare in the Christmas good cheer; and hoped that the Emperor would make\r\na law that nobody should kill larks or do them any hurt. He was always\r\nvery fond of larks and said that their plumage was like a religious\r\ndress. \"Wherefore,--according to his disciple, Brother Leo,--it pleased\r\nGod that these lowly little birds should give a sign of affection for\r\nhim at the hour of his death. On the eve of the Sabbath day after\r\nvespers, just before the night in which he went up to God, a great\r\nmultitude of larks flew down over the roof of the house where he lay,\r\nand all flying together wheeled in circles round the roof and singing\r\nsweetly seemed to be praising God.\"\r\n\r\nHis disciples went forth from their headquarters, the _Portiuncula_,\r\nlike the Apostles, to preach the gospel, first to the people of Umbria\r\nand Tuscany, then on to Bologna and Verona, and soon over the Alps and\r\nacross the seas. The Order had three branches: the begging friars\r\nthemselves, tonsured and clad in undyed cloth, with cords about their\r\nwaists and sandals on their feet; the sister Clares, shut up in\r\nnunneries, and dressed most simply; and the third order, people who\r\ncontinued to live in the world, but wished to follow the example of\r\nChrist and his blessed imitator and servant, Francis. The first rule of\r\nthe begging friars had been very strict. For Francis the strait gate\r\nthat led to eternal life was poverty. Even in his lifetime after his\r\nOrder had become popular, there was grumbling and opposition; and after\r\nhis death, the literal observance of his wishes was promptly given up.\r\nHe would never allow his brethren to own a house or have a church; and\r\nyet within two years after his death the great basilica in Assisi was\r\nbegun, dedicated to him, and hurried to magnificent completion. The\r\nChurch, which held the doctrine of evangelical poverty fit only for mad\r\nmen of genius, laid her heavy hand on the Order, and guided and governed\r\nit as best suited her purposes. But it would be grossly unfair to the\r\nChurch to blame her for violating Francis's chief dogma. The total\r\nrejection of property, the total disregard of the morrow, seemed to her,\r\nas they seem to us to-day, doctrines wholly inapplicable to this world\r\nin which we find ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF THE EMPIRE (1216-1250)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church seized the Franciscan Order as a man in danger grasps at a\r\nmeans of safety, and shaped it to her needs; for, in spite of her\r\nbrilliant triumphs under Innocent, her needs were great. The Papacy and\r\nthe Empire approached their final struggle; both felt instinctively that\r\nthe issue must be decisive. Their fundamental incompatibility had been\r\naggravated by the union of the crowns of Sicily and Germany. Innocent\r\nhad been pushed by circumstances into supporting Frederick's claim to\r\nGermany, and though he had striven to prevent the natural consequences\r\nby extorting oaths from Frederick, yet as time went on the danger became\r\nclearer. Under Innocent's successor, Pope Honorius, the Papacy lay like\r\na cherry between an upper and lower jaw, which watered to close and\r\ncrunch it; and this extreme peril is the excuse for the bitterness of\r\nthe Popes in the contest which followed. The Papacy fought for its life.\r\n\r\nThe contest affected all Italy. Milan and many cities of the valley of\r\nthe Po were Guelf; but Pavia and some others were Ghibelline, not that\r\nthey loved the Emperor, but hated Milan; Florence and the other Tuscan\r\ncities, except Ghibelline Pisa and Siena, which hated Florence, were\r\nGuelf; Rome was split in two; the Colonna, the Frangipani, and other\r\ngreat families were generally Ghibelline, though permanent allegiance\r\nwas unfashionable, while the Orsini and others were Guelf. The Gray\r\nFriars, who swarmed from the Alps to the Strait of Messina, were\r\nsteadfast Guelfs, and even carried their loyalty so far, their enemies\r\nsaid, as to subordinate religion to political ends. On the other hand,\r\nthe aristocracy, which was chiefly of Teutonic descent, held for the\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nFrederick himself is the central figure of the period. In his lifetime\r\nhe excited love and hate to extravagance, and he still excites the\r\nenthusiasm of scholars. His is the most interesting Italian personality\r\nbetween St. Francis and Dante. I say Italian, for though Frederick\r\ninherited the Hohenstaufen vigour and energy, he got his chief traits\r\nfrom his Sicilian mother. Poet, lawgiver, soldier, statesman, he was the\r\nwonder of the world, _stupor mundi_, as an English chronicler called\r\nhim. Impetuous, terrible, voluptuous, refined, he was a kind of Caesarian\r\nByron. In most ways he outstripped contemporary thought; in many ways he\r\noutstripped contemporary sympathy. He was sceptical of the Athanasian\r\nCreed, of communal freedom, and of other things which his Italian\r\ncountrymen believed devoutly; while they were sceptical of the divine\r\nright of the Empire, of the blessing of a strong central government, and\r\nof other matters which he believed devoutly.\r\n\r\nBetween a stubborn Emperor, a stiff-necked Papacy, and obstinate\r\ncommunes, relations strained taut. The first break occurred between\r\nEmperor and Papacy. The Popes honestly desired to reconquer Jerusalem,\r\nwhich had fallen back into infidel hands, and incessantly urged a\r\ncrusade; but perhaps at this juncture their zeal was heightened by a\r\nnotion that the most effective defensive measure against the Emperor\r\nwould be to keep him busy in Palestine. Frederick had solemnly promised\r\nto go. He had also solemnly promised to keep the crowns of Germany and\r\nof the Two Sicilies separate, by putting the latter on his son's head;\r\nbut instead of this separation he kept both crowns on his own head, and\r\nsecured both for his son as his successor. In spite of this violated\r\npromise, Pope Honorius, a gentle soul, devoutly eager for the crusade,\r\ncrowned Frederick Emperor (1220), upon Frederick's renewed promise that\r\nhe would start on the crusade within a year. The year passed, then\r\nanother and another, and Frederick, with his crowns safe on his head,\r\ndid not move a foot towards Jerusalem. The gentle Honorius remonstrated;\r\nFrederick made vows, excuses, protestations, but did not go. Finally the\r\nmild Pope died, and was succeeded by the venerable Cardinal Ugolino,\r\nGregory IX, (1227-1241). Ugolino was a member of the _Conti_ family of\r\nLatium (so preeminently counts that they took their name from their\r\ntitle), and a near relation to Innocent III. His indomitable character\r\nproved his kinship. Blameless in private life, a warm friend to St.\r\nFrancis, deeply versed in ecclesiastical affairs, he had a benign face\r\nand noble presence; in fact, to quote the gentle Pope Honorius, he was\r\n\"a Cedar of Lebanon in the Park of the Church.\" But, in spite of his\r\nvirtue, his training, and his fourscore years, he was a very Hotspur,\r\nfiery, impatient, and headstrong. It was he who had put the crusader's\r\ncross into Frederick's hands and had received his crusader's vow; and\r\nnow, having bottled up his wrath during the pontificate of Honorius, he\r\ncould brook no further delay. Frederick made ready to go. Ships and men\r\nwere gathered at Brindisi, and, in spite of a pestilence which killed\r\nmany soldiers, the fleet set sail. A few days later word was brought\r\nthat Frederick had put about and disembarked in Italy.\r\n\r\nGregory was furiously angry, and despatched an encyclical letter to\r\ncertain bishops in Frederick's kingdom, which sets forth the papal side\r\nof the matter: \"Out in the spacious amplitude of the sea, the little\r\nbark of Peter, placed or rather displaced by whirlwinds and tempests, is\r\nso continuously tossed about by storms and waves, that its pilot and\r\nrowers under the stress of inundating rains can hardly breathe. Four\r\nspecial tempests shake our ship: the perfidy of infidels, the madness of\r\ntyrants, the insanity of heretics, the perverse fraud of false sons.\r\nThere are wars without and fears within, and it frequently happens that\r\nthe distressed Church of Christ, while she thinks she cherishes\r\nchildren, nourishes at her breast fires, serpents, and vipers, who by\r\npoisonous breath, by bite and conflagration, strive to ruin all. Now, in\r\nthis time when there is need to destroy monsters of this sort, to rout\r\nhostile armies, to still disturbing tempests, the Apostolic See with\r\ngreat diligence has cherished a certain child, to wit, the Emperor\r\nFrederick, whom from his mother's womb she received upon her knees,\r\nnursed him at her breasts, carried him on her back, rescued him often\r\nfrom the hands of them that sought his life, with great pains and cost\r\nstudied to educate him until she had brought him to manhood, and led him\r\nto a kingly crown and even to the height of the Imperial dignity,\r\nbelieving that he would be a rod of defence, and a staff for her old\r\nage.\"\r\n\r\nThe encyclical then proceeds to recount Frederick's promises, his\r\ndelays, evasions, excuses, and the false start from Brindisi, and adds,\r\n\"Hearken and see if there be any sorrow like the sorrow of your mother\r\nthe Apostolic See, so cruelly, so totally deceived by a son whom she had\r\nnursed, in whom she had placed the trust of her hope in this matter. But\r\nwe put our hope in the compassion of God that He will show to us a way\r\nby which we shall advance prosperously in this affair, and that He will\r\npoint out men, who in purity of heart and with cleanness of hand shall\r\nlead the Christian army. Yet lest, like dumb dogs who cannot bark, we\r\nshould seem to defer to man against God, and take no vengeance upon him,\r\nthe Emperor Frederick, who has wrought such ruin on God's people. We,\r\nthough unwilling, do publicly pronounce him excommunicated, and command\r\nthat he be by all completely shunned, and that you and other prelates\r\nwho shall hear of this, publicly publish his excommunication. And, if\r\nhis contumacy shall demand, more grave proceeding shall be taken.\"\r\n\r\nThis ban of excommunication was published over the world; bishops gave\r\nit out in their dioceses, priests in their parishes; Gray Friars told of\r\nit from Sicily to Scotland. Frederick in answer wrote letters to the\r\nkings of Europe, saying that the Roman Church was so consumed with\r\navarice and greed, that, not satisfied with her own Church property, she\r\nwas not ashamed to disinherit emperors, kings, and princes, and make\r\nthem tributary. To the King of England he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"Of these premises the King of England has an example, for the Church\r\nexcommunicated his father, King John, and kept him excommunicated till\r\nhe and his kingdom became tributary to her. Likewise all have the\r\nexample of many other princes, whose lands and persons she squeezed\r\nunder an interdict till she had reduced them to similar servitude. We\r\npass over her simony, her unheard-of exactions, her open usury, and her\r\nnew-fangled tricks, which infect the whole world. We pass over her\r\nspeeches, sweeter than honey, smoother than oil,--insatiable\r\nbloodsuckers! They say that the Roman Curia is the Church, our mother\r\nand nurse, when that Curia is the root and origin of all evils. She does\r\nnot act like a mother, but like a stepmother. By her fruits which we\r\nknow she gives sure proof.\r\n\r\n\"Let the famous barons of England think of this. Pope Innocent\r\ninstigated them to rise in revolt against King John as a stubborn enemy\r\nof the Church, but after that abnormally celebrated King made obeisance\r\nand, like a woman, delivered up himself and his kingdom to the Roman\r\nChurch, that Pope, putting behind him his respect for man and fear of\r\nGod, trampled down the nobles, whom he had first supported and pricked\r\non, and left them exposed to death and disinheritance, so that he,\r\nafter the Roman fashion, should gulp down his impudent throat the fatter\r\nmorsels. In this way, under the incitement of Roman avarice, England,\r\nfairest of countries, was made a tributary. Behold the ways of the\r\nRomans; behold how they seek to snare all and each, how they get money\r\nby fraud, how they subjugate the free and disturb the peaceable, clad in\r\nsheep's clothing but inwardly ravening wolves. They send legates hither\r\nand thither, to excommunicate, to reprimand, to punish,--not to save the\r\nfruitful seed of God's word, but to extort money, to bind and reap where\r\nthey have never sown.\r\n\r\n\"Against us also, as He who sees all things knows, they have raged like\r\nbacchantes, wrongfully, saying that we would not cross the sea according\r\nto terms fixed, when much unavoidable and arduous business about the\r\ngoing, and about the Church and about the Empire, detained us, not\r\ncounting sickness. First there were the insolent Sicilian rebels: and it\r\ndid not seem to us a good plan nor expedient for Christianity to go to\r\nthe Holy Land,\" etc. And he ended, so the chronicler says, with an\r\nexhortation to all the princes of the world to beware against such\r\navarice and wickedness, because \"_you are concerned when your\r\nneighbour's house is on fire_.\"\r\n\r\nThese letters show the temper on both sides. Outwardly, however, peace\r\nwas observed, and Frederick really went on the promised crusade; and,\r\nthough in Syria he found Patriarch, Templars, Hospitallers, and\r\nFranciscans all turned against him, he succeeded in making a treaty by\r\nwhich Jerusalem, Nazareth, and Bethlehem were ceded to him, and he\r\ncrowned himself king in Jerusalem. In the mean time hostilities had\r\nbroken out in Italy. Frederick incited the Roman barons to drive the\r\nPope from Rome, and the Pope preached a crusade against Frederick. But\r\nboth sides, having many cares within their respective jurisdictions, at\r\nlength made peace, and Frederick was enabled to go back to his\r\n_consuetas delicias_, his wonted delights.\r\n\r\nThis phrase, which was used by the Pope, probably contained an innuendo,\r\nfor gossip busied itself with Frederick's christianity and morals. He\r\ntolerated Saracens in his kingdom, lived on friendly terms with them,\r\nand preferred them in his army, for they were indifferent to\r\nexcommunication; and gossip added that he liked Saracen ladies, hinted\r\nat a harem, and alleged that in Syria he had accepted the present of a\r\ntroop of Moslem dancers. Gossip, spread by the glib tongues of mendicant\r\nfriars, charged him with saying, \"If God had seen my beautiful Sicily,\r\nhe would not have chosen that beggarly Palestine for His Kingdom,\"\r\n\"There have been three great impostors who invented religions, and one\r\nof them was crucified.\" Frederick's real offence in ecclesiastical eyes\r\nwas that he wished to subordinate the spiritual to the secular power. It\r\nwas natural, however, that pious folk should look askance at a prince\r\nwho, while Christendom was fighting Islam, hobnobbed with Mohammedans\r\nand seemed to find them more sympathetic than Christians.\r\n\r\nFrederick's real _consuetae deliciae_ were of another kind. In his\r\nSicilian court we catch the first streaks of the dawn that was destined\r\nto brighten into the day of the Renaissance. He himself was a highly\r\naccomplished man, spoke Italian, German, Arabic, and Greek, and took an\r\ninterest in mathematics, philosophy, and in general learning. But poetry\r\nwas his favourite pleasure. The Italian language, recently emerged from\r\ndog Latin, had just begun to serve literary uses, and Frederick's court\r\nhad the honour of producing the first school of Italian poetry. He, his\r\nsons Manfred and Enzio, his chief counsellor Pier della Vigna, and many\r\npoets and troubadours drawn thither by his fame, so far outstripped the\r\nrest of Italy that all Italian poetry, wherever written, was called\r\nSicilian.\r\n\r\nSicily was the most civilized place in Europe, now that Southern France\r\nhad been crushed by the Albigensian persecution. The old Greek stock\r\nkept some trace of their inheritance; the Arabs had brought their\r\nculture; the Normans had added chivalric ideas; the Crusades and\r\ncommerce had enlarged the intellectual boundaries; and Frederick himself\r\nhad extraordinary versatility. Mathematicians from Granada, philosophers\r\nfrom Alexandria, were as welcome as the troubadours from Provence.\r\nFrederick looked after his own royal estates, managed his stud farm in\r\nApulia, decided when brood mares should be fed on barley and when kept\r\nto grass. He was a great sportsman, too, and wrote a book on falconry.\r\nHe enacted a famous code of laws, far superior in many respects to\r\nexisting legislation, which was conceived with the definite plan of\r\nexalting royal authority over feudal prerogatives and communal customs.\r\nHe deprived the barons of criminal jurisdiction; forbade private war,\r\ncarrying weapons, etc; he limited trial by ordeal so far as he could,\r\ncalling it \"a species of divination;\" he made minute regulations in\r\nmatters of business and behaviour, and maintained a paternal authority.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Sicily, with its culture, poetry, Moslems, and its unorthodox\r\nking, succeeded to the heretical position of Southern France. The Papacy\r\nfelt instinctively that a civilization so happy in the good things of\r\nthis world, so lax on many points of morality, so careless of the Roman\r\necclesiastical system, was a perpetual menace to it. In the nature of\r\nthings, the peace that had been made with Frederick could not last long.\r\n\r\nThe breach happened in the North. The Lombard cities revolted. Frederick\r\nmarched against them and won a victory (1237). Then was the zenith of\r\nhis power; his very triumph was the cause of his undoing. All the Guelfs\r\nof Italy roused themselves for the struggle. The Pope took part, and a\r\nsecond time excommunicated Frederick, enumerating a score of sins. A\r\nlater Pope held a council at Lyons (a place of safety), excommunicated\r\nFrederick again, and deposed him from his Imperial throne (1245). Then\r\nan anti-emperor was set up. Blow on blow fell upon Frederick. He was\r\nterribly routed at Parma, through carelessness. His gallant son Enzio,\r\nthe poet, was captured by the Bolognese, who would not release him,\r\nthough Frederick offered to put a rim of gold round the walls of their\r\ncity. Enzio spent twenty-three years in prison and there died. Pier\r\ndella Vigna, who \"kept both the keys of Frederick's heart,\" was\r\nsuspected of high treason and condemned to death. Frederick himself died\r\nin 1250, and the Pope shouted for joy at the news, \"Be glad ye Heavens,\r\nand let the Earth rejoice!\" He had good reason, for the Church had lost\r\nits most dangerous enemy.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Frederick the Empire came to its end. The name of Holy\r\nRoman Empire continued till 1806, and from time to time for several\r\nhundred years German kings came down across the Alps to receive the\r\nImperial crown, but on Frederick's death the old mediaeval Empire\r\npractically ceased; and Italy, instead of being an Imperial province,\r\nbecame a series of independent states.\r\n\r\nThe end of the Hohenstaufens themselves reads like the last act of a\r\nbloody Elizabethan tragedy. Within a few years the only survivors among\r\nFrederick's descendants were his lawful heir, a baby, Conradin, and an\r\nillegitimate son, Manfred. Manfred, who had inherited the charm, the\r\naddress, the energy and brilliance of his father, succeeded in\r\nestablishing himself in the Two Sicilies, at first as regent for his\r\nnephew, and afterwards, for in those troubled times a regency was\r\nprecarious, as king in his own right. But the Popes were resolved not to\r\nundergo a repetition of the danger they had experienced from Frederick,\r\nand laid their plans to destroy the last of the \"viper's brood,\" as they\r\ncalled Frederick's family. They followed the old precedent, set in the\r\ndays when the Papacy had been in danger from the Lombards, and invited a\r\nFrench prince, Charles of Anjou, brother to St. Louis, to come and\r\ndepose Manfred, and offered him the crown of the Two Sicilies. The\r\ncrafty, capable, deep-scheming Charles accepted, and came amid great\r\nrejoicing among the Guelfs. Rome made him Senator. Florence made him\r\n_podesta_; in fact, all Guelf Italy was at his feet. The Pope proclaimed\r\na crusade against Manfred, collected tithes and taxes for the holy\r\npurpose, and provided Charles with an army. Manfred was defeated and\r\nkilled (1266), and two years later, the valiant Conradin, a lad of\r\nsixteen, who came down in the mad hope of regaining his kingdom, was\r\nalso defeated, taken prisoner, and, after a mock trial for treason, put\r\nto death. Thus the Papacy prevented the union of the Two Sicilies with\r\nthe Empire, and thus the House of Anjou supplanted the last of the\r\nHohenstaufens at Palermo and Naples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE FALL OF THE MEDIAEVAL PAPACY (1303)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now coming out of the Middle Ages, and the dawn of a new era\r\ngrows more and more apparent. The Empire, embodiment of an old outworn\r\ntheory, has already fallen, and its victorious rival, the Papacy, in so\r\nfar as it embodies the mediaeval idea of a theocratic supremacy, is\r\ntottering, and it, too, will soon fall before the unsympathetic forces\r\nof a new age. So long as the Papacy stood untouched, it looked as potent\r\nand sovereign, and spoke with as lofty a tone, as in the days of\r\nInnocent; but a hundred years had wrought great changes, and at a push\r\nit tumbled and fell.\r\n\r\nHints had already been dropped that the dread thunderbolt, the curse of\r\nRome, which had helped win the proud position of lordship over Europe,\r\nhad become mere _brutum fulmen_. Excommunication had been so prodigally\r\nused for political purposes that educated men no longer believed that it\r\nwas really the curse of heaven. Moreover, Europe had not been standing\r\nstill. The vigorous, compact kingdom of France had come into being, and\r\nflushed with a sense of power and importance, determined to take that\r\npart in European politics which it regarded as its due. In angry\r\nself-confidence the young kingdom confronted the overweening Papacy,\r\nsavagely tore off its giant's robe, and laid bare its real weakness.\r\n\r\nBoniface VIII (1294-1303) was the pontiff under whom the papal empire\r\ncame to its end. He was a vigorous, energetic, arrogant, eloquent,\r\nhandsome man, with a wide knowledge of law, diplomacy, and politics. In\r\nthe cathedral at Florence there is a large statue of him, calm and\r\ndignified, almost heroic. He sits with his rochet and tiara on, his\r\nright hand raised with two fingers extended as if blessing,--an unusual\r\noccupation,--and looks far more of this world than of the other. His\r\ncontemporary, the Florentine historian, Villani, a Guelf, says: \"He was\r\ngreat-minded and lordly, and coveted much honour, ... and was much\r\nrespected and feared for his learning and power. He was very grasping\r\nfor money in order to aggrandize the Church and his own relations,\r\nmaking no shame of gain, for he said that he might do anything with what\r\nbelonged to the Church.... He was very learned in books, very wary and\r\ncapable, and had great common sense; he had wide knowledge and a good\r\nmemory, but was extremely cruel and haughty with his enemies and\r\nadversaries, ... more worldly than befitted his exalted station, and he\r\ndid many things displeasing to God.\" Dante, passionately Ghibelline,\r\ncalls Boniface \"prince of the new Pharisees\" and sends him to hell.\r\n\r\nBoniface's chief enemies, as was usual in the case of a Pope who had\r\nenemies, were Romans. If the Papacy had been able to reduce Rome to real\r\nobedience, its history would have been different. The rebellious\r\ncommune and the rebellious barons were constantly on the watch for\r\nfavourable opportunities to revolt, or, as they regarded it, to assert\r\ntheir rights and liberties, and Boniface's first struggle came with the\r\ngreat House of Colonna. The Colonnas were haughty; he was imperious.\r\nThey hinted that he was not legally Pope; he excommunicated them,\r\nproclaimed a crusade, captured and destroyed their fortresses in the\r\nCampagna, and made them deadly enemies. This victory was achieved at a\r\nprice thereafter to be paid in full. But for the time Boniface was\r\ntriumphant, and seemed, to himself at least, to sit as high as the great\r\nInnocent a hundred years before.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1300 he originated the custom, ever since observed, of a\r\npapal jubilee to celebrate the centennial year. For centuries Palestine\r\nhad been the destination of pilgrims, and the holy character of Rome had\r\nbeen passed by, but, now that Palestine was completely lost, Rome\r\nreasserted herself as the pilgrims' city, and crowds again visited the\r\nRoman basilicas. Eager to encourage a practice which he saw would\r\nincrease the prestige and the income of the Holy See, Boniface issued\r\nhis Bull of Jubilee which promised remission of sins to all pilgrims who\r\nshould visit the basilicas of St. Peter and St. Paul during the year.\r\n\r\nPious folk came from everywhere; on an average there were two hundred\r\nthousand at a time. They gave their offerings so generously that, as an\r\neyewitness says, \"Day and night two priests stood beside the altar in\r\nSt. Paul's, holding rakes in their hands, raking in the money.\" It was\r\nnoticed, however, that there were no kings or princes in the throng.\r\nThat year was the summit of Boniface's prosperity.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the quarrel with France had already begun. The French\r\nking, Philip the Fair, who was the personification of the new lay\r\nspirit, enacted a series of laws against the clergy, and, going counter\r\nto the accepted doctrine of clerical immunity from secular taxation,\r\nlevied taxes upon them. This step was portentous. Boniface answered by\r\nabsolutely forbidding both taxation and payment of taxes. The King of\r\nFrance not only persisted in taxation, but also forbade the exportation\r\nof any money from his kingdom, and so deprived the Pope of all his\r\nFrench revenues. Other angry words and acts followed, and a papal bull\r\nwas publicly burnt in Paris.\r\n\r\nBoniface, who had a marked predilection for vehement language, issued a\r\nbull, which deserves to be quoted as it sums up the extreme papal\r\ndoctrine and also incidentally reveals how completely he misunderstood\r\nthe drift of public opinion. \"We are compelled, our faith urging us, to\r\nbelieve and hold--we do firmly believe and simply confess--that there is\r\none holy and Apostolic Church, outside of which there is neither\r\nsalvation nor remission of sins.... In this Church there is one Lord,\r\none faith, one baptism.... Of this one and only Church there is one body\r\nand one head,--not two heads as if it were a monster,--Christ, namely,\r\nand the Vicar of Christ, St. Peter, and the successor of St. Peter....\r\nWe are told by the word of the gospel that in this His fold there are\r\ntwo swords,--namely, a spiritual and a temporal.... Both swords ... are\r\nin the power of the Church; the one, indeed, to be wielded for the\r\nChurch, the other by the Church; the one by the hand of the priest, the\r\nother by the hand of kings and knights, but at the will and sufferance\r\nof the priest. One sword, moreover, ought to be under the other, and the\r\ntemporal authority to be subjected to the spiritual.... That the\r\nspiritual exceeds any earthly power in dignity and nobility we ought the\r\nmore plainly to confess the more spiritual things excel temporal\r\nones.... A spiritual man judges all things, but he himself is judged by\r\nno one. This authority, moreover, even though it is given to man, and\r\nexercised through man, is not human but rather divine, being given by\r\ndivine lips to Peter and founded on a rock for him and his successors\r\nthrough Christ Himself; the Lord Himself saying to Peter: 'Whatsoever\r\nthou shalt bind,' etc. Whoever, therefore, resists this power thus\r\nordained by God, resists the ordination of God. Indeed, we declare,\r\nannounce, and define, that it is altogether necessary to salvation for\r\nevery human creature to be subject to the Roman Pontiff.\"\r\n\r\nIn retort the king, knowing that the country was behind him, convoked\r\nthe States-General of the kingdom; which upheld him, charged Boniface\r\nwith all sorts of misbehaviour, and called for a general council of the\r\nChurch to judge the matters in dispute.\r\n\r\nThe crafty king, however, had determined on other means of revenge than\r\ndecrees, accusations, and burning bulls; he devised a plot to kidnap\r\nBoniface and fetch him prisoner to France. One William Nogaret, once a\r\nprofessor of law in a French university, now deep in the king's\r\ncounsels, went to Italy, met a vindictive member of the Colonna family,\r\nSciarra Colonna, and the two arranged the details of the plot. There\r\nwere many conspirators, for not only the Colonnas were eager to revenge\r\nthemselves, but numerous nobles, dispossessed to make room for the\r\nPope's relations, were ready to lend a hand. The unsuspecting Boniface,\r\nnow an old man of eighty-six years, was at Anagni (a little fortified\r\ntown not far from Rome), his native place, but nevertheless honeycombed\r\nwith treason; here, from the pulpit of the cathedral where Emperors had\r\nbeen excommunicated, he proposed to excommunicate the King of France.\r\nTwo days before the day set for the excommunication, Nogaret and Sciarra\r\nColonna, with a troop of soldiers, entered the city which had been\r\nopened by traitors; many of the townsmen ranged themselves under the\r\nFrench banner. The conspirators broke into the episcopal palace, where\r\nthey found the valiant old man seated on a throne, in his pontifical\r\ngarments, with the tiara on his head, and a cross in his hand. Sciarra\r\nColonna dragged him down and would have stabbed him with his dagger but\r\nthat Nogaret withheld him by main force. The Pope was made prisoner and\r\nthe palace sacked; but in a few days sympathy turned, papal partisans\r\nstormed the palace, rescued Boniface, and carried him to Rome. Here the\r\nOrsini, pretending to befriend him, kept him shut up in the Vatican,\r\nhalf crazed by fright and fury, till death happily released him (October\r\n11, 1303). Then men remembered an old prophecy uttered concerning him:\r\n\"He shall enter like a fox, reign like a lion, and die like a dog.\" Thus\r\ndramatically the hollowness of papal power was revealed.\r\n\r\nFrance did not rest content with this insolent act. A year or two later,\r\na Frenchman of Gascony, the archbishop of Bordeaux, was made Pope by the\r\nFrench king's influence. This Pope, Clement V (1305-14), never went to\r\nRome, but took up his abode at Avignon, a little city on the Rhone, not\r\nvery far from its mouth. The place was under the overlordship of the\r\nAngevin kings of Naples, but really under the influence of the kings of\r\nFrance. Here the Papacy stayed for nearly seventy years, practically a\r\ndependency of France. A series of French Popes succeeded one another.\r\nThey built on the bank of the Rhone a gigantic fortress, regarded Rome,\r\nthe source of their greatness, as a dismal and dangerous out-of-the-way\r\nplace, and believed that they had transferred the seat of the Papacy\r\npermanently. This period of exile was regarded by the Italians as a\r\nBabylonish captivity.\r\n\r\nPolitical degradation was not all. The Roman Curia became a collection\r\nof men of pleasure. The ambitious Popes, even Boniface, had had a touch\r\nof the heroic in them, and erred through pride, arrogance, and hate; but\r\nthese Avignonese Popes, though some of them were good men, suffered the\r\npapal court to become a place of amusement, banqueting, and\r\ndissipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nLAST FLICKER OF THE EMPIRE (1309-1313)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Papacy had been dragged in servitude to France, the Empire,\r\nlike a dying soldier who gets on his feet to shout one shout of triumph\r\nover his enemy's fall, made a last gallant effort to recover life and\r\nstrength. The effort was very gallant but very ineffectual, and owes its\r\nchief celebrity to its connection with the great man, who summed up and\r\nreiterated the Imperial creed, somewhat in the same way that Pope\r\nBoniface had summed up and reiterated the papal creed. Both creeds were\r\ndead, but each man believed his fervently, and as Boniface's bulls set\r\nforth the doctrines of Hildebrand and Innocent III, so Dante's treatises\r\nand letters set forth the beliefs of Barbarossa and Frederick II.\r\n\r\nThe year of Boniface's jubilee is the year to which Dante assigns his\r\njourney to the abodes of departed spirits, and as the jubilee marked the\r\nclose of the mediaeval Papacy, so the \"Divine Comedy\" marks the close of\r\nmediaeval theology, and Dante himself stands as the greatest mark at the\r\nboundary between the old world passing away and the modern world coming\r\nin. Giovanni Villani, who was about fifteen years younger, described him\r\nin this way: \"He was deeply versed in almost all learning, although he\r\nwas a layman; he was a very great poet, a philosopher, and a complete\r\nmaster of rhetoric in prose and verse as well as in public speech; a\r\nmost noble writer, very great in rhyme, with the most beautiful style\r\nthat ever was in our language up to his time and since. In his youth he\r\nwrote the book on 'The New Life of Love,' and then when he was in exile\r\nhe composed twenty ethical poems and many admirable poems on love; and\r\nhe wrote among others three noble epistles; one he sent to the\r\ngovernment of Florence, complaining of his banishment from no fault of\r\nhis; another he sent to the Emperor Henry, when he was at the siege of\r\nBrescia, blaming him for his delay, in the tone of a prophet; the third\r\nto the Italian cardinals, during the vacancy after the death of Pope\r\nClement (V), that they should come to an accord and elect an Italian\r\nPope; all in Latin, in lofty style, with excellent reasonings and\r\nappeals to authority, which were much praised by men of judgment. This\r\nDante by reason of his knowledge was somewhat arrogant, haughty, and\r\ndisdainful, and, like an ungracious philosopher, he could not talk\r\neasily with unlearned men; but because of his other merits, the learning\r\nand the worth of this great citizen, it seems fitting to give him\r\nperpetual remembrance in this chronicle of mine, notwithstanding that\r\nhis noble works left to us in writing bear true testimony to what he was\r\nand confer honourable fame upon our city.\"[12]\r\n\r\nDante, by passages in his \"Divine Comedy,\" but more particularly by his\r\ntreatise \"De Monarchia\" (On Universal Empire), enables us to understand\r\nhow the Empire could raise its head in Italy sixty years after\r\nFrederick II had died. In Germany after an interregnum, the House of\r\nHapsburg had mounted the throne, but no one had ventured to cross the\r\nAlps for the Imperial crown. Nevertheless, Dante and the Ghibellines\r\ncould not bring themselves to believe that the old familiar institution\r\nhad fulfilled its function and was to be cast aside. The conception of\r\nEurope as a group of equal nations had not yet arisen, and Ghibellines\r\nstill believed that a Roman Emperor could put down confusion, anarchy,\r\npolitical chaos, and cure all the ills of Italy. The Ghibellines\r\nbelieved in the Emperor as Mohammedans believed in Mohammed; if he\r\nshould return, exiles (like Dante) would be restored, peace would bloom,\r\nand Rome again become the head of a just and universal empire. Dante, in\r\nthe \"De Monarchia,\" first contends that universal empire is necessary to\r\nthe well-being of the world; having established that proposition, he\r\nargues that this universal empire rightly belongs to the Roman people,\r\nand proves his point by appeals to Virgil and the New Testament; then he\r\nproceeds to show that the authority of the Empire is derived directly\r\nfrom God. \"Some say,\" he says, \"that Constantine when he was cleansed of\r\nthe leprosy by the prayers of Silvester, then Pope, gave the seat of the\r\nEmpire, to wit Rome, to the Church, together with many other dignities\r\nappertaining to the Empire. Therefore, they argue, since then no one can\r\nreceive those dignities, except he shall receive them from the Church,\r\nto whom they belong.... This proposition I deny; and when they put\r\nforth their proof, I say it proves nothing, because Constantine could\r\nnot alienate the dignities of the Empire, nor the Church receive\r\nthem.... No man has a right to do things by means of an office entrusted\r\nto him, which go directly counter to that office.... Therefore an\r\nEmperor has no right to divide the Empire ... and the Church in no wise\r\nis able to receive temporal things because the precept expressly forbids\r\nit, as we have it in Matthew 'Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor\r\nbrass in your purses, nor scrip for your journey,' etc.\"\r\n\r\nThis Ghibelline theory was in flat contradiction to Boniface's theory,\r\njust as the Imperial creed had always contradicted the papal creed. In\r\nDante's time the two conflicting theories seemed to have become mere\r\nghosts; when of a sudden the Imperial theory started up in reality. A\r\nnew king of the Romans, Henry VII, announced that he was coming into\r\nItaly to take his Imperial crown. The Ghibellines welcomed him with\r\nboundless enthusiasm. Dante, in undeserved exile from Florence, flushed\r\nwith the hope of return to his dearly beloved city, wrote a circular\r\nletter to all the princes of Italy:--\r\n\r\n\"Behold now is the acceptable time, in which arise signs of consolation\r\nand peace. For a new day begins to shine, showing the dawn that shall\r\ndissipate the darkness of long calamity. Now the breezes of the East\r\nbegin to blow, the lips of heaven redden, and with serenity comfort the\r\nhopes of the peoples. And we who have passed a long night in the desert\r\nshall see the expected joy.\r\n\r\n\"Rejoice, O Italy, pitied even by the heathen, now shalt thou be the\r\nenvy of the earth, because thy bridegroom, the comfort of the world and\r\nthe glory of the people, the most merciful Henry, Divus, Augustus,\r\nCaesar, hastens to thy espousals. Dry thine eyes, put off the trappings\r\nof woe, O thou Fairest; for he is at hand who shall free thee from the\r\nprison of the ungodly, who shall smite the malignant, and destroy them\r\nwith the edge of the sword, and shall give his vineyard to other\r\nhusbandmen, who will render the fruits of justice in the time of\r\nharvest.\"\r\n\r\nThe hope that Henry would restore peace and establish order warmed even\r\nthe Guelfs; and almost all the Italian cities, excepting stubborn\r\nFlorence, sent envoys to greet him as he came to take the Imperial\r\ncrown. The French Pope was greatly perplexed as to what to do. On the\r\none hand, he had begun to wish for an Emperor to subdue the Roman barons\r\nand to be a counterweight to the French king, whom he found too\r\nmasterful a protector; on the other hand, he was afraid to displease the\r\nFrench king, and to do anything that might set the Ghibellines on their\r\nfeet again. So he played a double game: he encouraged Henry in the\r\nNorth, and in the South he strengthened the Angevin King of Naples, the\r\nleader of the Guelfs. Henry VII crossed the Alps in October, 1310. He\r\nwas brave, honest, and just; he believed devoutly in his Imperial\r\nmission, desired peace, and wished to be Emperor of Guelf and Ghibelline\r\nalike. At first all went well; many cities opened their gates and\r\nreceived Imperial vicars; Milan lowered her flags as Henry entered, and\r\nher Guelf archbishop put the iron crown of Lombardy upon his head. But\r\nthis happy calm could not last long. Henry was poor, he asked Milan for\r\na great deal of money, and then demanded, ostensibly as a guard of\r\nhonour for his journey to Rome but really as hostages, fifty noblemen\r\nfrom each of the two parties. The Ghibellines assented: but the Guelfs\r\nsuspected treachery and refused; their leaders fled and their houses\r\nwere sacked and burned. This was the end of peace. Henry attempted to\r\nenforce obedience. He sacked Cremona, razed her walls to the ground, and\r\nlaid siege to Brescia. The horrors of the siege were fearful; the\r\ncitizens fought with desperation, but yielded at last to famine and\r\npestilence. The unfortunate Henry had now been forced into the old\r\nposition of German tyrant and Ghibelline party chief; and, instead of\r\nmarching directly on Rome, or on rich Florence which was the head and\r\nfront of the Guelf cause in the North, he had wasted valuable time in\r\ntaking unimportant cities. The Ghibellines were in a fever of\r\nimpatience. Dante wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"To the most holy Conqueror, and only lord, our lord Henry, by divine\r\nprovidence King of the Romans, ever Augustus, your Dante Alighieri, a\r\nFlorentine and undeserving exile, and all Tuscans everywhere, who wish\r\nfor peace on earth, kiss your feet.\r\n\r\n\"For a long time have we wept by the rivers of confusion, and have\r\nincessantly prayed for the protection of a just king, who should ... put\r\nus back in our just rights. When you, successor of Caesar and Augustus,\r\ncrossing the ridges of the Apennines, brought back the venerable\r\ninsignia of Rome ... like the sun suddenly uprising, new hope of better\r\ntime for Italy shone out. But now men think you delay, or surmise that\r\nyou are going back ... and we are constrained by doubt to stand\r\nuncertain and to cry, like John the Baptist, Art thou he that should\r\ncome, or do we look for another?... Do you not know, most excellent of\r\nPrinces, do you not see from the watch-tower of your exalted height,\r\nwhere the stinking little fox lurks, safe from the hunters? In truth,\r\nthe evil beast does not drink of the headlong Po, nor of your Tiber,\r\nbut its wickedness pollutes the rushing waters of the Arno, and the name\r\nof this dire, pernicious creature (do you not know?) is Florence. She is\r\nthe viper turned against the breast of its mother; she is the sick sheep\r\nthat contaminates the whole herd of her master. Indeed with the\r\nfierceness of a viper she strives to tear her mother; she sharpens the\r\nhorns of rebellion against Rome, who made her in her own image and\r\nlikeness....\r\n\r\n\"Up, then, break this delay, take confidence from the eyes of the Lord\r\nGod of Hosts, in whose sight you act, and lay low this Goliath with the\r\nsling of your wisdom and the stone of your strength; for with his death\r\nthe dark night of fear shall cover the camp of the Philistines, and they\r\nshall flee, and Israel shall be set free. And just as now, exiles in\r\nBabylon, we mourn remembering holy Jerusalem, so, then, citizens and at\r\nhome, we shall breathe in peace and turn the miseries of confusion into\r\njoy.\r\n\r\n\"Written in Tuscany ... fourteen days before the kalends of May, 1311,\r\nin the first year of the coming into Italy of the divine and most happy\r\nHenry.\"\r\n\r\nHenry did go south, but there were greater obstacles in his way than\r\nDante imagined. The spirit of the age was against him. It was vain to\r\ntry to bring back the past. Florence shut her gates, manned her walls,\r\nsent more money to his enemies, and headed a league of the Guelf cities\r\nin Tuscany and Umbria. Even Rome was half against him. The Ghibelline\r\nnobles received him and took him to their part of the town; but the\r\nGuelfs held St. Peter's, and though there was fierce fighting in the\r\nstreets, the Guelfs stood their ground, and Henry was forced to receive\r\nthe Imperial crown from the papal legate (the Pope was too prudent to\r\nleave Avignon) in the basilica of St. John Lateran. Here the luckless\r\nEmperor stayed for a time in the midst of ruin, material, political, and\r\nmoral. Then he attempted to crush Florence, the ringleader of\r\ndisobedience, but her walls were too strong; the impotent Emperor could\r\ndo no more than harry the country-side. He fell back upon Ghibelline\r\nPisa, and set patiently to work to gather together a new army. The\r\nGhibellines gallantly responded to his call, and Henry actually set\r\nforth on his way to Naples, to punish the House of Anjou and avenge the\r\nHohenstaufens, but death cut short his lofty plans. He died in a little\r\ntown near Siena (1313), and the hopes of Dante and the Ghibellines were\r\nruined forever. The last flicker of the Empire had gone out.\r\n\r\nOther Emperors, it is true, crossed the Alps, but not as masters. The\r\nconnection of Italy with the Holy Roman Empire ends with the death of\r\nthe gallant Henry. The mediaeval Papacy and the mediaeval Empire had\r\npassed away, for the Middle Ages themselves had come to an end.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] _Storia di Firenze_, lib. ix, cap. cxxxv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA REVIEW OF THE STATES OF ITALY (ABOUT 1300)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that the two great actors, whose long-drawn quarrel has been the\r\nmain thread of Italian history, have made their exits, and left us, as\r\nit were, with a sense of emptiness, it becomes necessary to call the\r\nroll and make a better acquaintance with the lesser _dramatis personae_,\r\nwho step to the front of the stage and carry on the plot of history. The\r\nprogramme reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n DRAMATIS PERSONAE\r\n\r\n The Papacy              An absentee.\r\n The Empire              A shadow.\r\n The Kingdom of Naples   House of Anjou reigning.\r\n The Kingdom of Sicily   House of Aragon reigning.\r\n Florence                A Guelf democracy.\r\n Siena                   Ghibelline city.\r\n Pisa                    Ghibelline city.\r\n Genoa                   A maritime aristocracy.\r\n Venice                  A maritime oligarchy.\r\n Milan                   A Lombard commune.\r\n Savoy                   A feudal county.\r\n\r\n Guelf cities of Tuscany, communes of Lombardy,\r\n petty marquisates of the northwest,\r\n etc.\r\n\r\nIn the South, the kingdom of the Two Sicilies has already been torn in\r\ntwo. Charles of Anjou, the conqueror of the Hohenstaufens, clever,\r\nshrewd, and capable as he was, had overreached himself. He entertained\r\ngreat ambitions, and was dreaming of Constantinople and its imperial\r\ncrown, when a rebellion known as the Sicilian Vespers broke out in\r\nSicily. The country had been overrun with French office-holders and\r\nFrench soldiers, and the Sicilians, who regretted the Hohenstaufens, had\r\nreached the utmost limit of endurance. The whole island had become a\r\npowder-box; it was a mere matter of accident where and how the powder\r\nwould ignite. A French soldier insulted a woman on her way to church. In\r\na moment he was killed and his fellow soldiers massacred to a man.\r\n\"Death to the French!\" resounded over the island, and the infuriated\r\nSicilians put all to the sword. The revolutionists needed a leader, and,\r\nas the old Norman blood royal still survived in Manfred's daughter, they\r\ninvited her husband, King Pedro of Aragon, to be their king. Pedro\r\naccepted, and he and his descendants, the House of Aragon, made good\r\ntheir claim to the throne of Sicily against all the attempts of the\r\nHouse of Anjou and of the lords suzerain, the Popes, to oust them. By\r\nthis revolution, Sicily was separated from the Kingdom of Naples for\r\nmore than a hundred years.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of Italy there was great disorder. The lords of the Papal\r\nStates remained at Avignon, and attempted to govern their dominions by\r\nlegates; but though their sovereignty nominally extended from the\r\nTyrrhene Sea to the Adriatic, they were impotent to enforce it. There\r\nwas no unity; each town was governed separately by a papal legate, by a\r\npowerful baron, or by a communal government. Rome itself, which in the\r\nabsence of the Popes had dwindled to a little city of ruins, towers,\r\nchurches, vineyards, and vegetable gardens, was in constant disorder.\r\nThe towns near by were often faithful to their allegiance, but across\r\nthe Apennines the obstinate little cities between the mountains and the\r\nsea were almost always independent. At present there is nothing of\r\nsufficient interest to prevent us from treating Rome as carelessly as\r\nthe Popes did, and passing hurriedly through to Florence and the\r\nindependent communes of Northern Italy where we must pause.\r\n\r\nPrior to the wars between the Empire and the Papacy feudal institutions\r\nhad prevailed there, though with less vigour in Northern Italy than\r\nelsewhere in Europe, and all the land had been divided up into various\r\nfiefs, in which counts and marquesses held sway. During those wars the\r\ncities shook off Imperial dominion and got rid of Imperial rulers, and\r\nbegan their careers as independent Italian communes. Most of these\r\ncities were of old Roman foundation, but the time of Hildebrand and\r\nHenry IV may be deemed their nativity, as then they first appear in\r\nItalian history as individuals. All these towns were little republics,\r\neach with its own character, but all conforming more or less to a\r\ngeneral type. Within massive walls the city clustered round two main\r\npoints, the cathedral, which was flanked by belfry and baptistery, and\r\nthe _piazza_ (public square), on which fronted the _Palazzo Pubblico_,\r\nthe city hall, where the magistrates had their offices. Round about and\r\nradiating off, houses and palaces, grim and heavy, stood high above the\r\nnarrow streets. Scattered here and there scores of private fortresses\r\nraised their great towers thirty yards and more into the air. Street,\r\npalace, tower, all were obviously ready for street warfare, waiting on\r\ntiptoe for the bells to ring.\r\n\r\nThe citizens were divided into three classes. The upper class included\r\nthe old nobility, the high clergy, the large merchants, the rich\r\nbankers; the middle class included the petty merchants, the tradesfolk,\r\nthe master artisans; and below them came the miscellaneous many. In some\r\ncities the nobility, allying itself with the proletariat, held the\r\npolitical power. But in the more democratic cities, like Florence, the\r\ntrades and crafts controlled the government. In Florence there were\r\nseven greater guilds,--judges and notaries, wool-merchants, refiners and\r\ndyers of foreign wool, silk-dealers, money-changers, physicians and\r\napothecaries, furriers; and fourteen lesser guilds,--butchers,\r\nshoemakers, masons, carpenters, blacksmiths, and so on. Every freeman\r\nwas obliged to belong to one of the guilds; Dante was enrolled in the\r\nguild of physicians and apothecaries. Trades and crafts descended from\r\nfather to son, and each guild was divided into masters, journeymen, and\r\napprentices.\r\n\r\nIn the government, executive, legislative, and judicial powers were\r\ndistinguished, but not strictly separated. The executive power was\r\nvested in one man, or in several men, who were assisted by a kind of\r\nprivy council. This council superintended various matters of public\r\nconcern, such as weights, measures, highways, and fines. There was also\r\na larger council, to which, as well as to public office generally, only\r\nthe enfranchised citizens were eligible. These privileged persons were\r\nnever more than a small fraction of the population; in Florence, for\r\ninstance, barely three thousand, even in her populous days. Finally,\r\nthere was a _parliament_ or assembly of all the free citizens, which met\r\non the _piazza_, and shouted approval or disapproval to such questions\r\nas were submitted to it.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier days the joint executives were called _consuls_. Their\r\nplaces were not easy. If they were fair to all, they displeased their\r\nown party; if unfair to the opposite party, they were liable to\r\nretaliation. The difficulties of partisanship led to the appointment of\r\na new officer, the _podesta_. The name and idea came from the governors\r\nput in the Imperial cities by Barbarossa. The _podesta_, who was elected\r\nby the citizens, supplanted the consuls in all their more important\r\nfunctions; he became the head of both the civil and the military\r\nservice, a kind of governor. He was a nobleman, chosen, in the hope of\r\navoiding local partisanship, from some other Italian city. The citizens,\r\nif Guelf, of course chose a Guelf; if Ghibelline, a Ghibelline. When the\r\n_podesta's_ term of office, which was usually six months or a year,\r\nbegan, he came to the city bringing two knights, several judges,\r\ncouncillors, and notaries, a seneschal and attendants, and in the\r\n_piazza_ took his oath of office,--to observe the laws, to do justice,\r\nand to wrong no man. His duties, and often his movements, were\r\ncarefully prescribed; sometimes he was not allowed to enter any house in\r\nthe city other than the palace prepared for him. At the end of his term\r\nhe was obliged to linger for a time, in order to give anybody who might\r\nbe aggrieved an opportunity to lodge a complaint against him and obtain\r\nredress. Such was the ordinary form of communal government; but the\r\nconstitutions varied in different cities, and in each city shifted every\r\nfew years, as class feeling, partisan enmity, or new men suggested\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity and power of these communes came from trade, and show how\r\ntrade prospered and riches accumulated. Some merchant guilds carried on\r\na very extensive business. Take the wool guild of Florence. Tuscany\r\nyielded a poor quality of wool, and as it was impossible to weave good\r\ncloth from poor wool, these Florentine merchants imported raw wool from\r\nTunis, Barbary, Spain, Flanders, and England, wove it into cloth so\r\ndeftly that foreigners could not compete with them, and exported it to\r\nthe principal markets of Europe. Trade with the North, however, was less\r\nimportant than trade with the East. Merchandise was carried over the\r\nseas more easily than over the Alps, and in many respects the products\r\nof the East were better and more varied than those of northern Europe.\r\nThe Italians loaded the galleys of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa with silken\r\nand woollen stuffs, oil, wine, pitch, tar, and common metals, and\r\nbrought back from Alexandria, Constantinople, and the ports of Asia\r\nMinor and Syria, pearls, gold, spices, sugar, Eastern silk, wool and\r\ncotton, goatskins and dyes, and sometimes Eastern slaves. Such a wide\r\ncommerce outstripped the capacity of barter and cash, and gave rise to a\r\nsystem of banking, with its attendant credits and bills of exchange. The\r\nquick-witted Florentines excelled at this business, and great banking\r\nhouses, like the Bardi and the Peruzzi, had branches or correspondents\r\nin all the chief cities.\r\n\r\nThis large commerce in face of the obstacles that barred its way seems\r\nextraordinary. A city like Florence, for instance, especially in the\r\nearlier days, was greatly hampered by the conditions about her. Outside\r\nher walls, within the radius of a dozen or twenty miles, were castles\r\nmanned by arrogant nobles, who made traffic unsafe. They would not\r\nconform to the new economic condition of society except upon compulsion.\r\nRival cities refused to let Florentine wares pass through their\r\nterritories without payment of ruinous tolls. Wars were waged to\r\nmoderate these exactions. Or, again, war was necessary to enforce the\r\nrights of Florentine citizens in other cities. Moreover, each city had\r\nits own system of weights and measures, its own coinage; each imposed\r\ncustoms on all wares entering its gates, in earlier days so much a\r\ncart-load, afterwards a percentage of the value. On all highways, at all\r\nbridges and fords, there were tolls to be paid. From city to city a\r\nmerchant had to change his money, until in later times certain coins,\r\nlike the Florentine florin, passed current everywhere; and sometimes, on\r\nentering the gates, he was obliged to adopt a distinguishing badge, as,\r\nfor instance, according to the usage at Bologna, putting a piece of red\r\nwax on his thumb-nail. These were the fetters placed on trade in time of\r\npeace; but peace itself was transitory and uncertain. Apart from the\r\nwars with the Emperor, the cities periodically fought the feudal\r\nnobility, or one another. Venice made war on Ravenna, Pisa on Lucca,\r\nVicenza on Treviso, Fano on Pesaro, Verona on Padua, Modena on Bologna,\r\nand the greater cities, like Milan and Florence, on any or all of their\r\nrespective neighbours. When a city had no absorbing war abroad, factions\r\nfought at home. Burghers and nobles barricaded the streets, manned the\r\ntowers, rang the bells, shot and hacked one another with spasmodic fury.\r\nThe burghers generally won. They then banished hundreds of their\r\nadversaries, and made laws against them. In some cities a register was\r\nkept to record the names of the nobles whose democracy was suspected; in\r\nothers, as in Lucca, nobles were excluded from all share in the\r\ngovernment, and were not allowed to testify against burghers. In Pisa,\r\nif there was disquiet in the streets, the nobles were obliged to stay\r\nindoors.\r\n\r\nThese factions called themselves Guelfs and Ghibellines. At first Guelfs\r\nwere the burghers of the communes and partisans of the Papacy, and\r\nGhibellines partisans of the Empire and the feudal system; but\r\nsubsequently the terms merely served to distinguish political parties,\r\nwhose platforms, as we should say, shifted with questions of the hour.\r\nEven when these two factions were at peace, they distinguished\r\nthemselves by different badges and fashions. The merlons of the Guelf\r\nbattlements were square, those of the Ghibelline swallow-tailed. Good\r\nparty men wore caps of diverse pattern, did their hair differently, cut\r\ntheir bread and folded their napkins in different ways. It was enough\r\nthat one side should bow, take an oath, harness a horse, in one mode,\r\nfor the other side to start a contrary fashion.\r\n\r\nThe growth of population, of property, of commerce, however, shows that\r\nhistory may easily dwell too much upon fighting and war. In these petty\r\nwars and street frays, the numbers engaged were few, and but little\r\nblood was shed. Most of the fighting was a consequence of economic\r\ndifficulties. It was the mediaeval equivalent of strikes, lock-outs,\r\nboycotts, undersellings, rivalries, riots, and other phenomena of modern\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe maritime cities were in a very different position from the inland\r\ncities, and had a different history. They enjoyed great advantages for\r\ntrade. No feudal barons could bar the sea, and pirates and infidels were\r\nnot serious impediments. Greater commercial prosperity, however, begot\r\nmore bitter commercial jealousy. Genoa hated Pisa; no Genoese sailor\r\ncould endure the cut of a Pisan sail. Both cities had a large trade in\r\nthe Levant, and being so near each other became deadly rivals. They\r\nfought spasmodically for years, from the Gulf of Genoa to the Black Sea,\r\nand at last came to the death grapple. The time was unfortunate for\r\nGhibelline Pisa, as a Guelf league had been attacking her on land. The\r\ndecisive battle was fought off the island of Meloria, a few miles from\r\nthe mouth of the Arno. The Genoese, who outnumbered the Pisans, won a\r\ngreat victory, destroyed or captured many galleys, and took ten\r\nthousand prisoners (1284). Pisa never recovered from this blow. Florence\r\nand Lucca took immediate advantage of it to unite with Genoa, and force\r\nPisa to submit to a Guelf government; and from this time on greedy\r\nFlorence, like a hawk, kept her eyes fixed on poor Pisa, impatient for\r\nthe time when she should seize her prey.\r\n\r\nGenoa remained a republic, active, eager, impetuous, torn by factions\r\nand subject to many vicissitudes, but lack of space compels us to leave\r\nher and pass on to where \"Venice sits in state, throned on her hundred\r\nisles.\" She, queen of the sea, had even a more lavish portion of\r\nindividuality than her sister cities, individual as they all were, and\r\nhardly belonged to Italy, so completely did she hold herself aloof from\r\nthe two great interests of mediaeval Italy, the Empire and the Papacy. No\r\ncries of Pope's men and king's men, of Guelf and Ghibelline, disturbed\r\nthe Grand Canal or the Piazza of St. Mark's; no feudal incumbrances\r\nhampered her mercantile spirit, nor did papal anathemas cause a single\r\nVenetian ship to shift her course. Venice had long remained loyal to\r\nConstantinople, and even after all political dependence had ceased, was,\r\nin character and aspect, more a Constantinople of the West than an\r\nItalian city, a grown-up daughter, more beautiful than her beautiful\r\nmother, who, living her own triumphant and unfilial life, still retained\r\nmany of her mother's traits. Untroubled by sentiment, even in the\r\nCrusades, Venice always kept steadily in view her fixed purpose of\r\nincreasing her commerce and of securing foreign markets; and this\r\npurpose shaped her political actions, and also, indirectly, the form of\r\nher government.\r\n\r\nOriginally the citizens, assembled in public meeting, elected the Doge,\r\nand exercised a right to vote on important political matters; but the\r\ngreat families soon acquired control, and little by little turned the\r\ngovernment into an oligarchy. The first great step was taken in\r\nBarbarossa's time, just when the Lombard cities were struggling to free\r\nthemselves from Imperial dominion. A Great Council of four hundred and\r\neighty members was established, to which were given the powers of\r\nlegislation, appointment, electing the Doge, and filling vacancies in\r\nitself. The franchises of the people were all taken away and the\r\noligarchy left supreme. This oligarchy of merchant princes, in whom\r\npatriotism, pride of place, and love of gain harmoniously accorded, was\r\nan exceedingly competent body of men. The greatness of Venice was their\r\ngreatness, and they pursued it devotedly. Beginning early in life these\r\npatricians were trained for their duties by service in the navy and in\r\nthe merchant marine, or by employment in the government of the various\r\ncities, islands, and territories included in the long stretch of\r\ncoastwise empire. Knowing that Venice lived by commerce they made every\r\neffort by war, diplomacy, and private enterprise, to extend that\r\ncommerce. After the conquest and division of the Eastern Empire (1204)\r\nthey became more eager than ever for a monopoly of trade with the\r\nLevant, and inevitably came into deadly rivalry with Genoa, also\r\npassionately eager to hold the gorgeous East in fee.\r\n\r\nThe wars with Genoa, destructive though they were for the time being,\r\nwere of service to the aristocracy, for they made the Venetians\r\nappreciate the value of a compact governing body; and the aristocracy\r\ntook advantage of that appreciation to tighten its hold on the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThroughout the thirteenth century the Great Council, though it consisted\r\nentirely, or almost entirely, of patricians and elected its own members,\r\nhad been open to all classes. Any citizen, however unlikely to be\r\nelected, was eligible. At the close of the century the patricians\r\nsecured the enactment of a series of measures, which in substance\r\ndivided the citizens into two classes, those whose ancestors had sat in\r\nthe Great Council, and those whose ancestors had not, and decreed that\r\nonly members of the first class should be eligible. This legislation is\r\nknown as the closing of the Great Council. As all those who were\r\neligible naturally wished to become members, the Council gradually\r\nincreased until it finally numbered over fifteen hundred. The patricians\r\nalso further curtailed the powers of the Doge, divided the various\r\nfunctions of government among the main subdivisions of the Council,--the\r\nSenate, the Council of Forty, the Doge's cabinet, and the Council of\r\nTen,--and gave to the State the definite form of government which it\r\nmaintained to its end.\r\n\r\nFrom Venice we must pass by Milan and the cities of the Po, to where in\r\nthe extreme Northwest the Counts of Savoy, perched on the Alps,\r\nmaintained a precarious sovereignty over both slopes, with no resources\r\nexcept the muscles of their mountaineers and the possession of Alpine\r\npasses. Little did the proud maritime cities, Genoa and Venice, the\r\ngreat inland cities, Milan and Florence, and Rome least of all, suspect\r\nthat these poor counts would one day consolidate all the territory from\r\nthe foot of the mountains to the Riviera in a compact little kingdom\r\n(Piedmont), and from that as a pedestal, step to still higher honours.\r\nThe House of Savoy runs aristocratically back into legend; but about the\r\nyear 1000, a certain Humbert of the White Hand, emerging from historic\r\nobscurity, obtained the city of Turin and part of Piedmont, as a\r\nmarriage portion for his son, and thereby secured to his house a footing\r\nin Italy (1045). In the course of another century or so these Savoyards\r\nin a succession of Humberts and Amedeos, brave, shrewd, and usually\r\nsuccessful men, extended their dominions by war, by marriage, and by\r\nbargains. They made the most of their position as door-keepers to Italy,\r\nand exacted various privileges from needy Emperors, as the price of\r\npassing the Alps. They fought rival counts, waged innumerable petty\r\nwars, and rightly or wrongly acquired territories which are now parts of\r\nFrance, Switzerland, and Italy. The succession of counts reads like any\r\nother mediaeval genealogy; and their exploits, raids, and sieges viewed\r\nfrom this cold distance have a somewhat monotonous similarity; but\r\nsurvival proves the worth and valour of the stock, and when after long\r\ncenturies the people of Italy had need of princes, the House of Savoy\r\nwas the only noble house that had retained power and respect. It is a\r\nbrilliant example of the truth of the saying that those who have been\r\nfaithful over a few things shall be masters over many.\r\n\r\nSuch were the political divisions of Italy in this transition period\r\nwhich intervenes between the departing Middle Ages and the incoming\r\nModern World.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSITION FROM THE MIDDLE AGES TO THE RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis intervening period--the twilight between the Middle Ages and the\r\ndawn of the Modern World--needs a little further emphasis, from the very\r\nfact that it is a period of transition and sheds light both on the time\r\nbefore and the time after. On its emotional side it belonged to the\r\nMiddle Ages, on its intellectual side it belonged to the Modern World.\r\n\r\nIts religion was essentially mediaeval. For instance, a religious wave\r\narose in Perugia, spread through Italy, and crossed the Alps. Hosts of\r\npenitents, hundreds and thousands, lamenting, praying, scourging\r\nthemselves, went from city to city. Men, women, and children, barefoot,\r\nwalked by night over the winter's snow, carrying tapers, to find relief\r\nfor their emotional frenzy. These Flagellants were like a primitive\r\nSalvation Army, and gave unconscious expression to the profound and\r\nwidespread discontent with the Church. Their actions, however, so\r\nclearly exhibited religious mania that governments took alarm; the\r\nhard-headed rulers of Milan erected six hundred gallows on their borders\r\nand threatened to hang every Flagellant who came that way.\r\n\r\nOther forms of religious sentiment were more rational, and expressed\r\nthemselves in passionate calls for peace between neighbours and\r\ncountrymen. Priests adjured the fighting cities to be friends: \"Oh, when\r\nwill the day come that Pavia shall say to Milan, Thy people are my\r\npeople, and Crema to Cremona, Thy city is my city?\" In Genoa, one\r\nmorning before daybreak, the church bells rang, and the astonished\r\ncitizens, huddling on their clothes, beheld their archbishop, surrounded\r\nby his clergy with lighted candles, making the factional leaders swear\r\non the bones of St. John Baptist to lay aside their mutual hate. Gregory\r\nX (1271-76) pleaded with the Florentine Guelfs to take back the banished\r\nGhibellines. \"A Ghibelline is a Christian, a citizen, a neighbour; then,\r\nshall these great names, all joined, yield to that one word, Ghibelline?\r\nAnd shall that single word--an idle term for none know what it\r\nmeans--have greater power for hate than all those three, which are so\r\nclear and strong, for love and charity? And since you say that you have\r\ntaken up this factional strife for the sake of the Popes of Rome, now,\r\nI, Pope of Rome, have taken back to my bosom these prodigal citizens of\r\nyours, however far they may have offended, and putting behind me all\r\npast wrongs, hold them to be my sons.\"[13] In consequence of Gregory's\r\npassionate entreaty, one hundred and fifty leaders of each party met and\r\nembraced on the sandy flats of the Arno.\r\n\r\nThe most famous of these emotional peace-makings was the work of a\r\nDominican monk of Vicenza. On a great plain just outside Verona, a vast\r\ncongregation assembled (a contemporary said 400,000 people), from all\r\nthe warring cities far and near, bishops, barons, burghers, artisans,\r\nserfs, women, and children. The monk preached upon the text, \"My peace I\r\ngive unto you.\" The great company beat their breasts, wept for\r\nrepentance and joy, and embraced one another. Then the friar raised the\r\ncrucifix and cried, \"Blessed be he who shall keep this peace, and cursed\r\nbe he who shall violate it;\" and the audience answered \"Amen.\" It is\r\nhardly necessary to say that these emotional peace-makings were soon\r\nfollowed by martial emotions; freed prisoners were hurried back to\r\nprison, the recalled were banished again, and sword and halberd were\r\npicked up with appetites whetted by abstinence.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual side of this period is best represented by the\r\nuniversities, which had sprung up in many of the North Italian cities in\r\nthe preceding century. The term university signified a guild of\r\nstudents, and possessed many of the characteristics of our colleges. The\r\nuniversity was composed of students and professors, and governed itself.\r\nIt owned neither lands nor buildings, and in case of need could shift\r\nits abode with little trouble. The students, at least in a great\r\nuniversity like that of Bologna whither young men flocked by thousands\r\nfrom all Europe, were divided into two bodies, those from beyond the\r\nAlps and Italians. These two bodies were subdivided into groups\r\naccording to their state or city. Each group elected representatives,\r\nand these, together with special electors, elected the rector. This\r\nrepresentative body made a formal treaty with the town authorities, and\r\nsecured good terms, because the presence of a university, bringing\r\nmoney and fame, was of great consequence to the town. The professors\r\nwere appointed by the students. At Bologna Roman law was the chief\r\nstudy, and very famous jurists lectured there. We may remember that\r\nBarbarossa had recourse to Bologna when he was in need of lawyers to\r\ndetermine his Imperial rights. It was Roman law that attracted the great\r\nconcourse of students, for the growing needs of civilization made a\r\nconstant demand for men learned in the law; but other branches of\r\nknowledge were also taught, theology, canon law, medicine, and\r\nastrology, as well as the so-called _quadrivium_, music, arithmetic,\r\ngeometry, and astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe universities, although theology and canon law were taught in them,\r\ndistinctly represented the secular side of intellectual life. The\r\nreligious, at least the theological side, was represented by the Church,\r\nand more particularly by those philosophers who devoted themselves to\r\nthat mixture of theology and philosophy known as scholasticism. The\r\ngreatest of them was Thomas Aquinas (1227-74), whose surname is derived\r\nfrom a little village, Aquino, once existing near Monte Cassino in\r\nNeapolitan territory. Aquinas lectured at various universities. His\r\ngreat work, \"Summa Theologiae,\" was a justification of the Roman Catholic\r\nfaith by an appeal to the reason and to science as then accepted. He\r\nstarted on premises laid down by the Church, and justified all the\r\nderivative doctrines by close logic and clear reasoning, as well as by\r\nappeals to the Bible, to Aristotle, then deemed the possessor of all\r\nknowledge, and to the Church fathers. His work is a complete exposition\r\nof God, nature, and man, as conceived by mediaeval theology, and is still\r\ntaught by the Catholic Church as the true exposition of its doctrines.\r\nThe grateful Church canonized him, his treatise being the miracles he\r\nhad performed, and named him the Angelic Doctor. Those of us whose minds\r\nhave no natural aptitude for scholasticism, find his views on purely\r\nearthly matters much easier to understand, and not uninteresting, as\r\nthey throw light on the democratic character of the Church. Speaking of\r\npositive law, Aquinas says that it should consist of \"reasonable\r\ncommands for the common good, promulgated by him who has charge of the\r\npublic weal;\" and of kings, that \"a prince who makes personal\r\ngratification instead of the general happiness his aim, ceases to be\r\nlegitimate, and it is not rebellion to depose him, provided the attempt\r\nshall not cause greater ills than his tyranny;\" and, of the nobility,\r\nthat \"many men make a mistake and deem themselves noble, because they\r\ncome of a noble house.... This inherited nobility deserves no envy,\r\nexcept that noblemen are bound to virtue for shame of being unworthy of\r\ntheir stocks; true nobility is only of the soul.\" St. Thomas Aquinas is\r\nalso interesting because his theology inspires Dante throughout the\r\n\"Divine Comedy.\"\r\n\r\nThese diverse traits, emotional and intellectual, were natural to a\r\nperiod of transition, when society was passing from an age in which the\r\nchief interests were emotional to one in which the chief interests were\r\nintellectual; and it is interesting to notice that at the same time\r\nsocial life was passing from a stage of extreme simplicity to one of\r\ncomparative luxury. The accumulation of wealth had its effect in every\r\ndepartment of life; it gave people time and opportunity for intellectual\r\ninterests, and also for luxury and more delicate needs. The advance in\r\nwealth was very rapid. By the year 1300 men had already begun to blame\r\nthe luxurious habits of their time, and to look back to the simplicity\r\nof their grandfathers as to an age of primitive innocence. Dante gives\r\nfull expression to these sentiments through the mouth of his ancestor,\r\nCacciaguida, in the \"Paradiso.\" Others speak in the same way. One of\r\nthem, referring to the time of Frederick II, says: \"In those times the\r\nmanners of the Italians were rude. A man and his wife ate off the same\r\nplate. There were no wooden-handled knives, nor more than one or two\r\ndrinking-cups in a house. Candles of wax or tallow were unknown; a\r\nservant held a torch during supper. The clothes of men were of leather\r\nunlined; scarcely any gold or silver was seen on their dress. The common\r\npeople ate flesh but three times a week, and kept their cold meat for\r\nsupper. Many did not drink wine in summer. A small stock of corn seemed\r\nriches. The portions of women were small; their dress, even after\r\nmarriage, was simple. The pride of men was to be well provided with arms\r\nand horses; that of the nobility to have lofty towers, of which all the\r\ncities in Italy were full. But now frugality has been changed for\r\nsumptuousness; everything exquisite is sought after in dress,--gold,\r\nsilver, pearls, silks, and rich furs. Foreign wines and rich meats are\r\nrequired. Hence usury, rapine, fraud, tyranny,\" etc.[14]\r\n\r\nTo us to-day this period of transition, with its mediaeval mixture of\r\ncommerce, religion, and war, of emotion and logic, of admiration for St.\r\nAugustine and belief in the infallibility of Aristotle, looks extremely\r\nodd. We forget that our generation may be in danger of similar\r\ncriticism. Odd or not, this was the state of Italy in the period\r\npreceding that great burst of the arts and intellectual life known as\r\nthe Renaissance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] _Storia degli Italiani_, Cesare Cantu, vol. ii, p. 851 (19).\r\n\r\n[14] _Europe in the Middle Ages_, Hallam, p. 630.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE INTELLECTUAL DAWN AFTER THE MIDDLE AGES (1260-1336)\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the beginning of the Modern World manifested itself in every\r\ndepartment of life, political, social, and intellectual, it is best\r\nknown to us through the arts, because in them it embodied itself in\r\npermanent forms. Italy suddenly leaped forward, as if she had drained a\r\nbeaker of champagne. To explain and illustrate this burst of passion,\r\nthe books generally use such phrases as emphasis upon individuality,\r\nimitation of the classic, observation of nature, wider range of\r\ninterest, the awakening of spiritual energy, etc. No doubt the phrases\r\nare just, but one must remember that underneath these manifestations of\r\nan eager interest in life, there actually was a larger, happier life,\r\ndue in great measure to security, ease, and the accumulation of\r\nproperty, which set men free from the bondage of continuous daily labour\r\nto satisfy corporal needs. Of that happier life, with its gayety and\r\nluxury, Villani, the historian of Florence, has given us a description.\r\nHe himself was a boy at the time. \"In the year of Our Lord 1283 the city\r\nof Florence, chiefly on account of the Guelfs who were in power, was\r\nprosperous and at peace, and in a state of great tranquillity, which was\r\nvery advantageous to the merchants and artisans. In June, at the Feast\r\nof St. John, in the quarter across the Arno, where the Rossi and their\r\nneighbours were the principal people, the nobility and the rich\r\norganized themselves into a company, and adopted a dress all white, and\r\nchose a master called the Lord of Love. The object of the company was to\r\nhave feasts, games, and dances for the ladies and gentlemen of the city,\r\nand other persons of quality. They used to parade the town with trumpets\r\nand other musical instruments, and had great dinners and suppers and all\r\nkinds of jollity. The festivities lasted nearly two months, and were the\r\nfinest and most celebrated that were ever held in Florence or all\r\nTuscany. Gentlemen and troubadours came from far and near, and all were\r\nreceived and entertained with distinction. And it is worth remembering\r\nthat the city and its citizens were better off then than they had ever\r\nbeen, and this prosperity continued till the division into Burghers and\r\n_Grandi_. There were then in Florence three hundred knights, and there\r\nwere many companies of gentlemen and ladies, who morning and evening\r\nkept open table richly spread, and had buffoons in attendance, so that\r\nfrom Lombardy and all Italy jesters, players, and jugglers came to\r\nFlorence, and all were welcome; and whenever a stranger of distinction\r\npassed through the city there was rivalry between the companies to get\r\nhim as their guest, and then he was accompanied, on foot or on\r\nhorseback, all through the city and the country round, most politely.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the light and careless side of the general awakening of\r\ninterest in life, which showed itself in so many nobler forms.\r\n\r\nIn literature Dante (1265-1321) is the first great figure. But, owing to\r\nhis disproportional importance, we are liable to forget that he has his\r\norderly place in the revival of poetry and literature which began in the\r\nbrilliant court of Frederick II in Sicily. On the destruction of the\r\nHohenstaufens, the poetic primacy passed to Bologna, where Guido\r\nGuinicelli and others composed poetry in a somewhat learned fashion, as\r\nbefitted a university town, and then passed on to Tuscany, and in\r\nparticular to Florence, where Dante was preceded by his friend Guido\r\nCavalcanti. Dante, although distinctly mediaeval by his theology, his\r\nappeals to the authority of Virgil and Aristotle, and by his political\r\nviews, has the characteristics of the new spiritual energy. He lays\r\nimmense stress on individuality, and delineates real life with wonderful\r\nvividness. These traits mark him as belonging to the new world coming in\r\nrather than to the old world going out.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of history, Dante's most marked achievement,\r\nperhaps, was to raise the Tuscan (or more strictly speaking the\r\nFlorentine) idiom, from among many competitors, to the dignity of being\r\nthe Italian language. This was the consequence of writing the \"Divine\r\nComedy\" in Tuscan, instead of in Latin. Dante's Tuscan verses were\r\nrecited in the tavern and on the _piazza_, and were greeted with loud\r\napplause by apprentices and artisans, shopmen and tavern-keepers. He\r\nexcited the enthusiasm of both educated and ignorant. At that time the\r\nspoken dialects were very numerous. A friend remonstrating with Dante\r\nfor writing in an Italian dialect instead of in Latin, said that there\r\nwere a thousand. Dante himself in his treatise \"On the Vernacular\r\nSpeech\" enumerates Sicilian, Calabrian, Apulian, Roman, Tuscan, Genoese,\r\nSardinian, Romagnol, Lombard, Venetian, and others. These dialects of\r\nthe provinces were further subdivided among themselves. In Tuscany the\r\npeople of Siena spoke one idiom, those of Arezzo another. In Lombardy\r\nthe citizens of Ferrara spoke in one way, the citizens of Piacenza in\r\nanother. Even in one city, as in Bologna, the dwellers in St. Felix\r\nStreet and those in Greater Street did not speak alike. Besides the\r\ndifficulties of many dialects, besides the immense prestige of Latin as\r\nthe language of learning, of law, of the Church, French appeared as a\r\npossible literary language for Italy. Authors in Florence, Venice,\r\nSiena, and Pisa wrote books in French, \"because the French language goes\r\nover the world, and is more delectable to read and to hear than any\r\nother.\" But Dante made the Florentine tongue immortal, and not only\r\nwrote the \"Divine Comedy\" in Florentine, but also \"The New Life\" and\r\n\"The Banquet.\" Prior to his time the divers idioms had stood on an\r\nequality; after his time Tuscan became the language of polite speech and\r\nof literature, the real Italian language, and the others were degraded\r\nto the position of mere dialects. Petrarch and Boccaccio, both\r\nFlorentines, also deserve their share of praise. Petrarch's sonnets and\r\nBoccaccio's stories firmly established the primacy to which Dante had\r\nraised the Tuscan idiom.\r\n\r\nThe revival of sculpture also began before the middle of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. Here the great leader is Niccolo Pisano (1206-78?). There has\r\nbeen a dispute as to his birthplace. Some say he came from Southern\r\nItaly and learned his art there. If this theory is true, Frederick's\r\nkingdom has the honour of having revived sculpture as well as\r\nliterature; but it is more likely that Niccolo came from some village in\r\nTuscany, and early went to Pisa, where he got his designation _Pisano_.\r\nThe first certain record of his work is an inscription on the pulpit in\r\nthe Baptistery at Pisa, which states that he completed the pulpit in\r\n1260. Pisa was then at the height of her glory, in the happy years\r\nbefore her fatal conflict with Genoa; she had built the Cathedral, the\r\nLeaning Tower, and the Baptistery, and now wished to beautify them\r\nwithin. Niccolo's pulpit shows both imitation of the classic and\r\nobservation of nature. He had before him bits of ancient sarcophagi,\r\nwhich had been built into the wall of the Cathedral: his Madonna bears\r\ntraces of the Phaedra of the sarcophagus, one of his three Wise Men\r\nresembles a young Greek, and his modelling in general has a touch of\r\nclassic freedom, dignity, and repose. In his conception of the scenes\r\nNiccolo adhered to ecclesiastical tradition, just as Dante did to\r\necclesiastical theology, but in his figures, in the drapery and various\r\ndetails, his faithfulness to reality is striking, at least when compared\r\nwith the Byzantine style theretofore prevailing. The success of this\r\npulpit was so great that a few years later he was asked to carve another\r\nfor the cathedral in Siena. An envoy came on purpose, and in the\r\nBaptistery of Pisa a contract was drawn up in which it was agreed that\r\nNiccolo should go to Siena and stay till the work was done, taking three\r\nassistants, and also his young son Giovanni, at half pay, if he wished.\r\nThis contract was made in 1265, the year of Dante's birth. Niccolo also\r\nworked at Bologna, Perugia, Pistoia, probably at Lucca and almost\r\ncertainly in many other places. This was the period of the free\r\ndevelopment of the communes after the death of Frederick II, and\r\nNiccolo's popularity is proof of widespread prosperity and interest in\r\nart. Niccolo's son Giovanni (1250-1328?) inherited his father's genius;\r\nand his work, especially his masterpiece, a pulpit at Pistoia, shows how\r\nfast art was developing. Giovanni, in his eagerness to express the\r\nanimation and passion of life, neglected the classic and went directly\r\nto nature, at least in desire if not in execution. This passionate\r\ninterest in life is the very quality that gives Dante's \"Inferno\" its\r\nintense vividness. These two Pisani founded the great Tuscan school of\r\nsculpture, and influenced both painting and architecture as well.\r\n\r\nItalian architecture at this time does not show one great figure like\r\nNiccolo Pisano, nor does it show a definite beginning of a new period.\r\nOn the contrary, throughout the Middle Ages building held its own\r\nsurprisingly well in comparison with the other arts. In the days of\r\nTheodoric the Ostrogoth, it carried on the Byzantine tradition at\r\nRavenna, and for centuries the churches in Rome were built on the old\r\nbasilican principle. Over a hundred years before Dante was born, and\r\nbefore Niccolo carved his pulpit, the Lombard style flourished in\r\nLombardy, Tuscan Romanesque in Tuscany, and Norman Sicilian in Sicily.\r\nBefore the Empire had received its _coup de grace_ the Gothic style came\r\ndown from the North, and its struggle with the Romanesque seemed to\r\ntypify the conflict between the German Empire and the Italian people.\r\nNevertheless, if we confine ourselves to Tuscany, as perhaps is fair in\r\nview of the very great influence of Tuscany on all the arts, there is\r\none man who stands out conspicuous. Arnolfo di Cambio (1232-1300?) began\r\nlife as one of Niccolo's assistants at Pisa, and did so well that he was\r\nincluded by name in the contract for the pulpit at Siena. In Florence he\r\nbuilt the church of Santa Croce for the Franciscans, designed the\r\nPalazzo Vecchio, and made the first plans for the Duomo; and so left a\r\ndeep impress on Florence and through Florence on the world.\r\n\r\nIn painting, more than in any other art or department of life, perhaps,\r\nauthority had reigned supreme throughout the Middle Ages. The decadent\r\nGreek painters of Constantinople had made a series of rules, which were\r\nas autocratic as the edicts of the Emperors. Every Madonna was painted\r\nin one attitude, with her eyes opening wide in the same way, arms, legs,\r\nand body in the same constrained position, with the same wooden child in\r\nher wooden lap, and the same wooden saints about her. But gradually,\r\nside by side with the art of authority, another style, at first very\r\nsimple and primitive, developed. The older style dominated mosaic work,\r\nand as mosaics were most intimately associated with the symbolic\r\nrepresentation of sacred things, it was strongly intrenched behind all\r\nthe beliefs and prejudices of the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, the\r\nrevolutionary spirit in Tuscany, for the leaders of the revolution which\r\nthrew off the authority of the Middle Ages came from among the free men\r\nof Tuscany, prevailed in painting as well as elsewhere. The last of the\r\nmasters who employed the Byzantine manner was Cimabue (1240-1302); yet\r\nCimabue had a sense of the coming change, and showed a desire to break\r\nthrough the enveloping shell of Byzantine authority and portray the\r\ngrace and beauty of living human beings. However mediaeval his manner\r\nseems to us, his contemporaries, eager as the Athenians for new things,\r\nperceived the novelty in it. When he was painting a Madonna for the\r\nDominican monks in Florence, Charles of Anjou, fresh from his triumph\r\nover Manfred, visited his studio for the honour of a first view, and\r\ncrowds pressed about hoping to get a glimpse of the picture. When the\r\npicture was carried through the streets to its destination in the church\r\nof Santa Maria Novella, a great procession followed, as if it were a\r\nhero returned from the wars. Poor Cimabue, however, is seldom mentioned\r\nexcept as a dull background against which the conquering Giotto stands\r\nin brilliant relief.\r\n\r\nGiotto (1267?-1336) is the master revolutionist of painting. He was a\r\ncontemporary of Dante, a few years younger, born at the time when\r\nNiccolo and Giovanni were working at the pulpit in Siena, and Charles\r\nof Anjou was posing as an admirer of the fine arts in Cimabue's studio.\r\nHe painted Dante in a fresco on the wall of the Bargello (a palace in\r\nFlorence), at least so tradition says; and Dante in the \"Divine Comedy\"\r\nspeaks of him as outstripping the once renowned Cimabue. Giotto was an\r\nugly little man, of great character and quick wit. Various stories are\r\ntold of his repartees. Once, when he was painting for the King of Naples\r\nand working with great diligence, the king, who used to watch him, said,\r\n\"Giotto, if I were you, I should not work so hard.\" \"I shouldn't,--if I\r\nwere you,\" retorted Giotto. He studied under Giovanni Pisano, and\r\nlearned so much that it has been said that \"Giotto is the greatest work\r\nof the Pisani.\" Giotto was also the successor to Arnolfo as the leading\r\narchitect in Florence, and built the Campanile of the Duomo, and, being\r\nlikewise a sculptor, modelled some of the bas-reliefs that ornament the\r\npanels of the base. His great art was painting, and especially the\r\npainting of figures. Giotto was in demand to paint frescoes on the walls\r\nof churches and chapels at Florence, Arezzo, Assisi, Padua, Ravenna,\r\nRome, and Naples; and other painters came from far and near to study\r\nunder him. He dominated Italian painting, and his school was the only\r\nschool for a hundred years. After the world had adopted Raphael's\r\nfrescoes as the type of excellence his fame was dimmed for a time, but\r\nsince Mr. Ruskin's enthusiastic admiration it has regained its ancient\r\nlustre.\r\n\r\nThese instances of revolution in the arts show that a new intellectual\r\nlife had begun, that the Middle Ages had really ended. In fact, the\r\npassing away of the Holy Roman Empire and of the European suzerainty of\r\nthe Papacy was merely an episode in the general intellectual\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE DESPOTISMS (1250-1350)\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps the quality which strikes us most in this dawn of our Modern\r\nWorld is its suddenness; Niccolo Pisano gets up, as it were, out of the\r\nground, Giotto follows Cimabue, Dante is born while Guido Guinicelli is\r\nstill a young man. We are amazed and bewildered, and it is not in the\r\narts alone that the change is so startling. The political structure\r\nshifts with equal quickness, and while we are trying to connect and\r\ncoordinate this outburst of art with the democratic triumph of the\r\ncommunes, the democratic communes disappear under our eyes. At first as\r\nwe look we are a little puzzled, for the outward form of the commune\r\nremains unchanged; the _podesta_ is still there, the Great Council and\r\nthe inner council are still there, the committees and the sub-committees\r\nsuperintending and directing the affairs of the commonwealth; but\r\nfurther observation discloses a lack of spontaneity. The motive power\r\ndoes not seem the resultant of the debate and argument of numerous\r\ndiscordant wills, but to proceed from some one definite inner source.\r\nMore careful observation shows that these outward committees are but\r\nregistering boards that record an inner will, that their members go to\r\none particular palace to have their minds made up, at first privily, but\r\nsoon openly, and at last confessedly and ostentatiously. This is the\r\nregular course. The commune is, as it were, a political chrysalis out of\r\nwhich a full-blown tyrant bursts. The tyrants were men of capacity, who\r\ngathered the various functions of the government into their own hands,\r\nand by a course of adroitness and fraud, or by a _coup d'etat_, reduced\r\nthe city to obedience, and then, after having exercised sovereign rights\r\nduring their lives, bequeathed the principality to their heirs. The\r\nreason of their success is plain. It was impossible for trade to\r\nflourish, for property to collect its income, for luxury to enjoy\r\nitself, under the political confusion that attended the democratic\r\nendeavours for self-government. The uncertainty in government, law, and\r\ntrade, was too high a price to pay for liberty. Men of property, men of\r\nbusiness, men of pleasure, preferred the comparative stability of a\r\ntyranny.\r\n\r\nBefore we look at this process in individual states we must eliminate\r\nthe exceptions. The kingdom of Sicily under the House of Aragon, and\r\nthat of Naples under the House of Anjou, had become, in great measure,\r\nabsolute monarchies, for the gifted Emperor Frederick, who was no lover\r\nof democracy, had crushed or circumvented the communal spirit in his\r\nkingdom. The suppression of popular liberties did not result in the\r\nstrict enforcement of order in either kingdom, particularly not in\r\nSicily where feudal anarchy was rampant; but we must leave those\r\nSoutherners to their oranges and lemons, to their flowers and azure\r\nskies, to their churches and cloisters, where Romanesque, Byzantine, and\r\nArab influences met and combined in arch and dome and sculptured\r\ntrimming, and go northward to find the main historical current of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFlorence, too, we must except from the tyrannic system, for a democratic\r\ngovernment prevailed there for many years to come, and also Rome, where\r\nthe Papacy prevented Colonna and Orsini from establishing a despotism.\r\n\r\nVerona shall serve as the paradigm for the despotic form of government.\r\nIn this ancient city on the banks of the Adige, where the amphitheatre\r\nof Augustus still stood though the churches built by Theodoric the\r\nOstrogoth had crumbled away, the spirit of material and intellectual\r\nactivity had been busily at work. The stately church of San Zeno\r\n(eleventh century), most beautiful of Romanesque churches, coloured with\r\nthe hues of early dawn and rich with bronze doors and sculptured front,\r\nstood proudly apart outside the walls; but within, the cathedral had\r\nbeen begun, and the great Ghibelline tower already lifted its\r\ncrenellated top high over the market-place. Rushing through the city the\r\nheadlong Adige turned innumerable mill-wheels, and Veronese girls washed\r\nthe clothes of the Capulets and Montagues in its waters. Altogether the\r\ncity was a very desirable signory. This fact had been discovered in\r\nFrederick's time, and Ezzelino da Romano, one of the Ghibelline nobles\r\nof the North, had made good his power there and distinguished himself by\r\nhis cruelty, for which he is still remembered. On his most satisfactory\r\ndeath, not long after Frederick's, the Scaligers succeeded to the\r\ndominion of the city (1259). These Scaligers were of the best type of\r\ntyrant, especially Can Grande (1311-1329), the fifth in possession of\r\nthe signory, who presents the type in its noblest and most attractive\r\nform. Nevertheless, despite his brilliance, his success and\r\nmagnificence, his chief renown is as host to the exiled Dante, who in\r\ngratitude for \"my first refuge and first hostelry\" dedicated the\r\n\"Paradiso\" to him, and celebrated his carelessness of hardship and of\r\ngold, and his doughty deeds from which even enemies could not withhold\r\ntheir praise.\r\n\r\nCan Grande, like other despots, had two objects,--to make his signory\r\nsecure, and to enlarge it. As he was secure of Verona, he cast his\r\ncovetous glances abroad and fixed them on Vicenza, a little town some\r\nthirty miles to the northeast. Vicenza was, so to speak, no longer in\r\nthe market, as she had been snapped up by her neighbour, Padua, which\r\nhad had the advantage of being less than twenty miles away. But Can\r\nGrande played his cards well, and by help of the Emperor Henry VII, who\r\nappointed him Imperial vicar, got possession of the prize. Padua, a rich\r\nand prosperous Guelf city, with subject towns round about, and a famous\r\nuniversity within, refused to acquiesce in a surrender of Vicenza to a\r\nGhibelline lord. A long war ensued. The fair fields in the forty miles\r\nbetween Verona and Padua were laid waste, the poor peasants were dragged\r\nto one city or the other and held for ransom, and the Guelfs in Verona\r\nand the Ghibellines in Padua were persecuted, imprisoned, and tortured.\r\nAt last Padua, her signory over, her neighbours lost, her population\r\nfallen away, her citizens fighting among themselves, her nobles\r\ndestroying one another in the hope of becoming lords of the city, gave\r\nway and surrendered to Can Grande. Other cities shared Padua's fate, and\r\nCan Grande, by virtue of his conquests as well as of his character,\r\nbecame one of the chief powers in Italy. Can Grande was brave even to\r\nrecklessness, covetous of dominion, steadfast in his political aims,\r\ntrue to his promises, generous to his enemies. On his death he\r\nbequeathed his signory to his nephew; and his body was buried in the\r\nchurchyard of a little Gothic chapel, where stone effigies of armoured\r\nScaligers on caparisoned steeds surmount Gothic tombs, and the pride of\r\nlife and conquest strives to overcrow death.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Scaligers must be continued somewhat further, for they\r\nexhibit the phenomenon, so frequent in Northern Italy at this time, of a\r\ndespotism that begins in vigour, continues in energy and success, and\r\nthen dies down under degenerate heirs to go out at last like a candle.\r\nCan Grande's nephew, Mastino (1329-51),--the family had a fondness for\r\ncanine appellations. Great Dog and Mastiff,--began his career with\r\nability and courage; he conquered Brescia to the west, halfway to Milan,\r\nand Parma, which lies beyond Mantua. These particular acts of aggression\r\nhelped his ruin, for Milan and Mantua took alarm and joined a league\r\nagainst him. But that was not till later. In the days of his prosperity\r\nMastino was very magnificent. Soldiers, horse and foot, attended him;\r\nhis palace was thronged with lords, gentlemen, and buffoons; his stables\r\nwere full of chargers and palfreys, his bird-sheds of falcons. At his\r\ncourt there were innumerable fashionable devices for driving care away,\r\ndancing, singing, jousting; everything was luxurious; men and furniture\r\nwere decked with embroidery, cloth of gold, cloth from France, and cloth\r\nfrom Tartary. When Mastino rode forth all Verona rushed to the windows;\r\nwhen he was angry all Verona trembled. He was a dark-skinned, bearded\r\nman, with heavy features and a great belly; in later life he ate\r\ngrossly, and sank into dissipation. Seldom on a Friday or Saturday, or\r\neven in Lent, would he refrain from meat; and he did not care a rap for\r\nexcommunication. He became arrogant and vainglorious. His dissipation\r\nand lack of piety, however, were less direct causes of his fall than his\r\nambition; he coveted, rumour said, a kingdom of Lombardy or even of all\r\nItaly. But at last he overreached himself in dealing with the\r\nFlorentines. They wished to get possession of Lucca, and he undertook to\r\nbuy it for them,--it was a fourteenth-century custom to sell a\r\ncity,--but when he got possession of Lucca he kept it for himself. The\r\nFlorentines declared war, and induced all his rival despots, the\r\nVisconti of Milan, the Gonzaga of Mantua, the Estensi of Ferrara, to\r\njoin a league against him. Venice also joined, being indignant with the\r\nScaligers for levying tolls upon merchandise that went up the Po, and\r\nfor interference with the Venetian monopoly of salt. The league was\r\nvictorious and forced the Scaligers to hard terms. Venice took the towns\r\nnear her, thus acquiring her first territory on the Italian mainland;\r\nthe great Paduan family, the Carrara, took back Padua; the Visconti of\r\nMilan took Brescia (1338). The Scaligers were shorn of their power, and\r\nfrom this time on the house dwindled; assassinations of brother by\r\nbrother darkened its close, and at the end of the century it lost Verona\r\nand all.\r\n\r\nWhat the Scaligers did at Verona other great families were doing\r\nelsewhere. The Gonzaga established themselves in Mantua, the Estensi in\r\nFerrara, the Bentivogli in Bologna, the da Polenta in Ravenna, the\r\nMalatesta in Rimini, the Montefeltri in Urbino, the Baglioni in Perugia,\r\nand greatest of all the Visconti in Milan. The city of Milan has so\r\nimportant a place in the history of Italy, that we must pause over the\r\nVisconti. This family succeeded in dispossessing its rivals and in\r\nbecoming masters of the city in 1295, about the time that the oligarchy\r\nwas clinching its hold on Venice, and the democracy becoming all\r\npowerful in Florence. In fact, one may accept this date as the point at\r\nwhich Florence, Venice, and Milan start on their upward careers towards\r\nbecoming three of the six chief divisions of Italy. Convenience has its\r\nrights, and it is eminently convenient to start the Renaissance,\r\npolitically as well as intellectually, in this eager, passionate last\r\nquarter of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Visconti, however, were not firm in their seats till the gallant\r\nHenry VII, Dante's hope, came down into Italy to revive the Empire. We\r\nhave seen that Henry did not revive the Empire, but he did strengthen\r\nCan Grande, his loyal lieutenant in Verona, and also the Visconti, his\r\nloyal friends in Milan. It is pathetic, even now, to think of that\r\nhigh-aspiring Henry, with his noble, old-fashioned ideas concerning the\r\nRoman Empire and universal brotherhood under the shelter of the Roman\r\neagle, and of the great Dante fastening all his hopes on those same\r\nold-fashioned ideas, while the crafty lords of Milan and Verona,\r\nlaughing in their sleeves, professed the most devout Imperial creed and\r\nfeathered their own nests. On the Emperor's death (1313) the Visconti\r\nwere firmly seated. The signory descended from one generation to the\r\nnext. Their sway was extended over the cities round about, until it\r\nincluded most of Lombardy. Ambition, growing by what it fed on, aimed at\r\nthe cities of Pisa, Bologna, and Genoa. Such plans aroused both jealousy\r\nand fear. The ambition of the Visconti to take Pisa alarmed Florence,\r\nwho had marked Pisa as her own; that to take Bologna stirred the\r\nabsentee Popes, who went through the old forms of excommunication,\r\ninterdict, and crusade; but Genoa, crippled by her wars with Venice,\r\nrent asunder by internal factions, wearily gave herself to Milan, in the\r\nvain hope of winning peace and security. In spite of checks here and\r\nthere, the state of Milan became more and more powerful, and the signory\r\nof the Visconti by far the greatest of the tyrannies in Italy.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, many men who attempted to become despots and\r\nfailed; and others who succeeded for their lifetimes, but were not able\r\nto make their signories so strong as to become family possessions to be\r\nenjoyed by their heirs after them. Of the latter kind one must be\r\nmentioned. In Lucca Castruccio Castracane (died 1328), a very brilliant\r\npolitician and soldier, became so powerful that he reduced to subjection\r\nmuch of the country round and nearly succeeded in conquering Florence,\r\nwith whom he was long at war. Like other successful tyrants he called\r\nhimself a Ghibelline, and drew what advantage he could from his\r\nprofession of faith, but really only aimed to acquire a principality for\r\nhimself. He died in the prime of life (to the great relief of the\r\nFlorentines), and left so brilliant a reputation for the qualities which\r\nachieve success by fair means or foul, that two centuries later\r\nMachiavelli held him up as an example for princes to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSICAL REVIVAL (1350)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now well started on the fourteenth century, and it will be well\r\nto glance at the chief Italian states in order to get our bearings.\r\n\r\nSicily was in a state of hopeless despondency. The island was nominally\r\nsubject to the House of Aragon, but its kings were not men of sufficient\r\ncharacter to impose their authority, and the unfortunate kingdom was\r\nbeginning to go down hill. The Kingdom of Naples was, for the time\r\nbeing, much better off, for its king, Robert, grandson of Charles of\r\nAnjou, was a man of unusual gifts and capacity, but he was succeeded by\r\na foolish, frivolous, light-minded, light-mannered granddaughter, Joan\r\n(1343-81), who brought forty years of trouble to her kingdom, and under\r\nher Naples started rolling down that same incline on which Sicily was\r\nrolling somewhat ahead of her. The failure of Sicily and Naples to take\r\npart in the great career in matters intellectual now opening before\r\nNorthern Italy is partly due to the race that populated them, a\r\nmiscellaneous mixture of bloods (at least it is customary to explain\r\nunknown causes of success and failure by saying good blood and bad\r\nblood), and partly to the autocratic will of the brilliant Frederick II,\r\nwho crushed out independence in his kingdom, and so deprived it of that\r\ncommunal life which is the only obvious factor, except \"good blood,\" in\r\nthe intellectual success of Northern Italy.\r\n\r\nThe whole pontifical state, from the fortresses of the Colonna on the\r\nTiber to the strongholds of the Malatesta in Rimini, was in the vortex\r\nof confusion.\r\n\r\nFlorence was well off, for though the foreigners whom she had invited to\r\nbe protectors against Castruccio Castracane and others were rather\r\ndetrimental than useful, and though there were signs of a new struggle\r\nbetween the _Grandi_ and the Burghers, her commerce prospered, her\r\ndominion spread over the towns round about, and her luxury grew so fast\r\nthat the troubled elders passed all sorts of sumptuary laws to prescribe\r\nwhat should be worn and what not, by both fashionable and simple.\r\n\r\nIn the northwest, now Piedmont, there were, besides the Counts of Savoy,\r\nseveral struggling claimants who severally asserted titles to their own\r\nand other strips of territory. In the northeast, Venice, which had\r\nacquired a footing on the mainland destined to grow into the province of\r\nVenetia, was prosperous. And between Piedmont and Venice the successful\r\nVisconti of Milan, soon to receive the keys of Genoa, were likewise well\r\nsatisfied. The political situation may now be dismissed, and we may turn\r\nto the distinguishing mark of the century, the classical revival.\r\n\r\nThe distinction which Italy enjoys as the most famous country in Europe\r\nis due to three ages,--first, the ancient epoch of Augustus Caesar and\r\nTrajan, when the Roman Empire imposed the _pax romana_ on a grateful\r\nworld; second, the mediaeval epoch of Hildebrand and Innocent III, when\r\nthe Papacy, following its great prototype with unequal steps, imposed\r\nits _pax romana_ on both troubled souls and angry hands; and third, the\r\nepoch of the Renaissance, when Italy took the lead in the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of modern Europe. It would be as absurd to subordinate\r\nintellectual life to politics in the period of the Renaissance as it\r\nwould be to subordinate the religion of the era of Hildebrand to its\r\nart, or the politics of the Augustan age to its religion. The highest\r\nlife of Italy, the life which gives importance to the history of this\r\ncoming period, is its intellectual life, and, though we must not forget\r\npolitics entirely, we should lay the chief stress on intellectual rather\r\nthan on political matters.\r\n\r\nSince the date of the Pisan pulpit, prosperity had increased fast, and\r\ncuriosity, the desire to investigate, the wish to know, had grown\r\nlustily. There were still the same two stores of knowledge,--nature and\r\nthe classics,--but the first, for many reasons, seemed vague,\r\nintangible, when compared to the second, in which the demi-gods (so they\r\nappeared then) of the ancient world had garnered the rich harvest of\r\ntheir thoughts. The classical heritage, the record of a higher\r\ncivilization, seemed a lay Bible, the revelation of truth, the means of\r\nsalvation; and the young generation emerging in the dawn of intellectual\r\nlight turned thirstily to this newly found inheritance. The leader of\r\nthis pilgrimage to the land flowing with intellectual milk and honey was\r\nFrancis Petrarch (1304-74).\r\n\r\nPetrarch was a Florentine, but he lived in exile. His father had been\r\nbanished at the same time with Dante, and after a few wandering years\r\nhad settled at Avignon. Petrarch studied law at the University of\r\nBologna and became a confirmed Ghibelline. This item of biography is\r\nimportant, because it reminds us that Petrarch's passion for the classic\r\nworld, though it had its roots in the traditional admiration for Rome,\r\nreceived strength and justification not only from Latin literature, but\r\nalso from the Civil law. Men who grasped the complexity and richness of\r\nthe Roman law necessarily admired Roman civilization, and inferred that\r\nall other manifestations of that civilization must be as admirable as\r\nthe law, and perhaps less dry. Petrarch found the law dry, but he left\r\nBologna with a passion for the classic world; and when he went back to\r\nAvignon he met all the most cultivated men of Europe. Learning still\r\nattended the papal court, and Avignon served to make this charming young\r\nscholar of genius known to the world. He flung up the law and devoted\r\nhimself to literature. Cicero was his hero. Petrarch was the first of\r\nthe humanists, the herald of the Renaissance, and, if we look farther\r\nforward still, the harbinger of the Reformation. Petrarch's importance\r\nwas very great because he was not too far ahead of his generation. He\r\nshouted aloud the glory of Rome, of Roman literature and Roman thought,\r\nand the echo resounded throughout Europe. In the year 1341, in Rome,\r\nupon the Capitoline Hill, Petrarch received the crown of laurel, as\r\nscholar and poet, from the Senate and People of Rome. The King of\r\nNaples was his sponsor, and the tyrants of the North applauded. This\r\nceremony was the conspicuous recognition that a new period was opening\r\nbefore Italy; and Petrarch's laurel crown may be put beside the Imperial\r\nwreath of Augustus and the tiara of Hildebrand, as the starting-point of\r\nItaly's third great period of triumph.\r\n\r\nAfter his coronation, Petrarch went about Italy spreading the seeds of\r\nthe new enthusiasm. He lived or made visits at Parma, Bologna, Verona,\r\nFlorence, Arezzo, Naples, Rome, Milan, Padua, and Venice. He became\r\ntremendously fashionable. The Pope invited him to be papal secretary,\r\nthe King of France extended the hospitality of Paris to him, the Emperor\r\nbade him to Prague, the Visconti wanted him at Milan, the Scaligers at\r\nVerona, the Cararresi at Padua, the lord high Seneschal at Naples; the\r\nFlorentines asked him to accept a chair in their new university, the\r\nVenetians offered him a house. All this honour ostensibly shown to\r\nPetrarch was really the salutation to the new dawn.\r\n\r\nThe strength of this classic revival, though most effective in\r\nliterature and the arts, is perhaps still more noticeable in the\r\npolitical career of another young man of genius who had as passionate a\r\nlove of classic Rome as Petrarch himself. Cola di Rienzo (1314-54) was\r\nan imaginative, poetical dreamer, who fed his youth on Livy, Cicero,\r\nSeneca, and delighted to muse on the glories of Julius Caesar and to\r\nstudy the antique monuments of Rome. His public career began as envoy on\r\none of the unsuccessful embassies which used to entreat the Popes to\r\nreturn to the deserted city. Cola was handsome, eloquent, ardent, a sort\r\nof Don Quixote, and roused the Roman populace to share his dreams and to\r\nbelieve in the possible restoration of the Senate and People of Rome to\r\ntheir ancient grandeur. He led the people against the nobility, forced\r\nthe riotous barons to submit to his rule as tribune of the people, and\r\nestablished a government of law in the city; but his ambition flew far\r\nbeyond the city walls. He dreamed of the confederation of all Italy\r\nunder the lead of Rome. He would have smiled at limiting imitation of\r\nthe great days of old to the arts or to literature; he intended to\r\nrestore the Roman Republic as it had been in its high and palmy days.\r\nHis wild aspirations throw a backward light over the history of the city\r\nof Rome throughout the Middle Ages, and over that republicanism which\r\nplayed so important a part in the struggle between Empire and Papacy,\r\nand light up the old theories under which the Roman people claimed the\r\nright to elect both Emperor and Pope; just as Boniface's bulls portray\r\nthe outworn papal theories, and Dante's \"De Monarchia\" the dead Imperial\r\nbeliefs.\r\n\r\nCola's first step was to invite all the princes and communes of Italy to\r\nattend a general meeting in Rome; and as all Italy had responded to\r\nPetrarch's appeal in behalf of the classic past, so did she, for the\r\nmoment, respond to Cola's appeal. Milan, Genoa, Lucca, Florence, Siena,\r\nand the smaller cities nearer by, answered with apparent sympathy.\r\nPetrarch was mad with delight, and hailed Cola as Camillus, Brutus,\r\nRomulus. For the moment, such was the strength of classical illusion,\r\nthe dream seemed to be real. Cola wrote to the Florentines (September,\r\n1347), \"We have made all citizens of the states of Holy Italy Roman\r\ncitizens, and we admit them to the right of election. The affairs of\r\nEmpire have naturally devolved upon the Holy Roman People. We desire to\r\nrenew and strengthen the old union with all the principalities and\r\nstates of Holy Italy, and to deliver Holy Italy itself from its\r\ncondition of abject subjection and to restore it to its old state and to\r\nits ancient glory. We mean to exalt to the position of Emperor some\r\nItalian whom zeal for the union of his race shall stir to high efforts\r\nfor Italy.\"[15]\r\n\r\nCola's great idea was destined to wait five hundred years for\r\nfulfilment. The time was not ripe, and he himself not a suitable\r\ninstrument. His career was brief. He became not only vainglorious but\r\nalso very cruel. He grew fat, and lost the charm of youth and novelty.\r\nThe nobles and the upper classes of Rome hated him; and when, in need of\r\nmoney, he increased the taxes, the Roman populace turned upon him,\r\nstormed the Capitol, captured him as he tried to slink away in disguise,\r\nand murdered him on the steps leading down from the palace. His head was\r\ncut off, his body was dragged through the streets and burned, and the\r\nashes scattered to the winds.\r\n\r\nThe mad dream had been, in its nature, evanescent. The classical\r\nheritage was too purely intellectual, too remote from existing needs, to\r\nbe able to shape politics. But that fourteen hundred years after the\r\ndeath of Julius Caesar, Cola should have been able to establish himself\r\nas Roman tribune on the Capitoline Hill, and to act as if the Republic\r\nof the days of the Gracchi had been but temporarily superseded, shows\r\nthe immense influence of Rome over the mediaeval imagination, and helps\r\nus to understand the autocratic power of the classical heritage in\r\nshaping and directing the intellectual revolution in Italy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] _Rome in the Middle Ages_, Gregorovius, vol. vi, p. 295, note 1\r\n(translated).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE ILLS OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth century undoubtedly felt itself emancipated from the\r\nlimitations of the Middle Ages, and with justice, so far as the\r\nclassical revival was concerned, but it did little or nothing to free\r\nitself from ills that were distinctly of a mediaeval character,--plague,\r\nlawlessness, and tyranny. In that respect, the transition from the\r\nMiddle Ages to the Modern World was slow and made a striking contrast\r\nwith the rapid evolution of art.\r\n\r\nThe chief of these ills was the plague. Only in remote places of the\r\nEast, if at all, does the scourge of disease now fall as it then did in\r\nthe most civilized cities of the world, and it was from the East that\r\nthese plagues came, brought by sailors. One blasted Tuscany in 1340, one\r\nLombardy in 1361; but the worst was the awful Black Death of 1348, which\r\nwrought havoc in various parts of Italy and then swept northward across\r\nthe Alps on its destructive path. It was this plague which Boccaccio\r\ndescribes in the beginning of the \"Decameron.\" It spread like fire among\r\ndry wood which has been sprinkled with oil. At first swellings appeared\r\nthe size of an egg or an apple, then black and hard spots; on the third\r\nday came death. Even animals caught the disease. Boccaccio saw two pigs\r\nwhich had chewed the garment of a plague-stricken man die in\r\nconvulsions. Medicine was useless. Some thought the wisest course was to\r\nlive on the daintiest food and drink, and never speak of the plague;\r\nothers believed in carousing and jollity, and went about from tavern to\r\ntavern seeking diversion, but always keeping sober enough to avoid the\r\nsick. Private houses were deserted and lay open to anybody. Loyalty\r\ndisappeared. All who could fled into the country. Thousands fell sick\r\ndaily. In place of decent burial, dead bodies were tossed huggermugger\r\ninto trenches. Between March and July, Boccaccio says, more than 100,000\r\npeople died within the walls of Florence.\r\n\r\nFlorence was not singular. In Siena 80,000 people, three quarters of the\r\npopulation, died; in Genoa, 40,000; in Pisa, seven out of ten, and so on\r\nin Venice, Rome, Naples, and Sicily. These figures seem incredible; but\r\nPetrarch says: \"Posterity will not believe that there ever was a period\r\nin which the world remained almost entirely depopulated, houses empty of\r\nfamilies, cities of inhabitants, the country of peasants. How will the\r\nfuture believe it, when we ourselves can hardly credit our eyes? We go\r\noutdoors, walk through street after street, and find them full of dead\r\nand dying; when we get home again we find no live thing within the\r\nhouse, all having perished within the brief interval of absence. Happy\r\nposterity, to whom such calamities will seem imaginings and dreams.\"\r\nPoor Petrarch! The lovely Laura, of whom he wrote so many perfect\r\nsonnets, died of the Black Death in Avignon. Giovanni Villani, the\r\nhistorian, died in Florence. This terrible calamity throws into high\r\nrelief the great classical impulse, to which the last chapter was\r\ndevoted. In earlier times men would have turned to religion and the\r\nChurch; but now Petrarch, a most devout Christian, and his disciples\r\ncontinued to worship Cicero and the heroes of the Augustan age, and to\r\ntalk of Caesar and Pompey, Scylla and Charybdis, as the most important\r\nand interesting of things.\r\n\r\nAnother great evil which rivalled the plague as a curse, was the host of\r\nmercenary soldiers who swarmed over Italy like locusts. In the days of\r\nBarbarossa, battles like that of Legnano had been fought between the\r\ntrain-bands of the communes on one side and the feudal chivalry and\r\nmen-at-arms on the other. But since then a great change had come over\r\nthe methods of raising soldiers. Under the feudal system the term of\r\nservice in the field for the liegemen of the Emperor had been forty\r\ndays; but that time was too short for an effective campaign. When the\r\nEmperor wished to cross the Alps and go to Rome in order to receive the\r\nImperial crown, he was obliged to hire soldiers; and, as years went on\r\nand these Imperial descents became mere adventurous expeditions, the\r\ncharacter of the soldiers degenerated, until in Petrarch's time the\r\nImperial armies were made up of ruffians recruited anywhere. There were\r\nalso other reasons for establishing mercenaries in place of militia. The\r\ndespots of Northern Italy did not wish their subjects trained to arms.\r\nThe burghers of mercantile cities did not wish to leave their\r\ncounting-rooms, nor to have their employees mustered out, so they too\r\npreferred hired soldiers to a native militia. Moreover, warfare had\r\nchanged; cavalry needed frequent manoeuvres, bowmen and pikemen\r\nrequired drill and continuous discipline. Thus the old train-band system\r\nof the communes, under which the militia hurried to their appointed\r\nposts on the ringing of the bells, gave way to the system of mercenary\r\ntroops led by soldiers of fortune, _condottieri_, as the Italians call\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThese soldiers, who had come down from the North to serve Emperors, or\r\ndespots like the Visconti, or perhaps had sailed from Spain to fight\r\nunder the House of Aragon in Sicily, as soon as the immediate war was\r\nended, having been left unpaid or having taken a liking to a trade in\r\nwhich the labor was congenial, the risk small and booty enormous,\r\ndecided not to disband, but to continue to try their luck together. They\r\nsold their services to whatever city or despot would pay them most, or\r\nwandered about in a nomadic fashion, capturing a city if they could, if\r\nnot, living on the country-side. One can imagine these rogues among\r\nunwarlike peasants, or in a pleasant little city like Lucca or Cremona.\r\nThey were very fickle, fought one another only upon compulsion, and then\r\nmost reluctantly and gently, and were very nearly as terrible to their\r\nemployers as to their adversaries. They were organized, sometimes very\r\nwell, in bands under a general or a council of officers, and had such\r\nnames as The Company of St. George, or The Great Company. Some of their\r\nleaders became very famous, like Duke Werner, who proclaimed himself\r\n\"Lord of the Great Company, enemy to God, to Pity, and to Mercy.\" The\r\nmost interesting of these leaders, at least for us, is John Hawkwood, an\r\nEnglish adventurer, who began life as a London tailor, but dropped\r\nscissors and needle to enlist for Edward III's French campaign, and\r\nthen, seeing fortune smile most sweetly from distraught Italy, crossed\r\nthe Alps and led his company all over the peninsula. There is a full\r\nlength fresco of him on horseback in the _Duomo_ at Florence, painted in\r\ngratitude for his deeds in life or merely for his death.\r\n\r\nFor a hundred years and more these ruffians swaggered about Italy.\r\nPetrarch finds in them one cause the more to hold out his arms toward\r\nthe mighty past. He writes in a letter: \"Oh, would that you were alive,\r\nBrutus, Great-heart, that I might turn to you. O Manlius--O Great\r\nPompey--O Julius Caesar [etc., etc., etc.], O Jesus, Lord of the world,\r\nwhat has happened? Why do I moan and groan for grief? Oh! a vile handful\r\nof robbers, spewed out of their nasty dens, walks and rides over the\r\nancient queen of the world, Italy. Christ Jesus, in tears and\r\nsupplication I turn to Thee. Oh, if we have abused Thy goodness more\r\nthan was right, if we have shown ourselves too proud in Thy aid and\r\nfavour, if we have borne ourselves ill towards Thee, well mayst Thou not\r\npermit us to be free; but let not this slaughter, these sacrileges,\r\nthese robberies, these deeds of violence, these ravishings of wives and\r\nmaidens, find mercy in Thine eyes. Put an end to this evil. To the\r\nwicked who have said in their hearts 'There is no God,' show that Thou\r\nart; and to us however unworthy, show that we are Thy children. O\r\nAlmighty Father, help us; in Thee alone we put our hope, and in\r\nsupplication we invoke Thy name, weeping and confessing that there is\r\nnone who shall fight for us, unless Thou, our Lord, be he.\"\r\n\r\nThis strange mixture of classic enthusiasm and Christian piety, this odd\r\nidea that the triumphant cause of the Roman Republic was due to the\r\nfavour of Christ, shows us that Petrarch had not yet got wholly clear of\r\nmediaeval beliefs. But, as with Cola di Rienzo, everything Petrarch says\r\ntestifies to the power of the Roman tradition.\r\n\r\nA third evil, yet not to be compared with the plague and the\r\n_condottieri_, was the tyranny of the despots. The founders of\r\ndespotisms were men of vigour and political capacity, and gave to their\r\nsubjects in lieu of liberty greater security and order than they had\r\nenjoyed before. Their descendants, like proverbial heirs, finding hard\r\nwork both distasteful and unnecessary, gave themselves up to dissipation\r\nand cruelty; they dropped their ancestors' attitude of leading citizens\r\nand treated the principalities as private property, intended for their\r\namusement. The Visconti, though they retained their family ability and\r\nforce of character longer than most princely houses, shall serve to\r\nillustrate the general dynastic development, more especially as the\r\nhistory of Milan, which had become the chief power in Italy, will be the\r\nbest thread to carry us to the end of the century.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of the century Archbishop Giovanni Visconti had\r\nbecome the lord of Milan (1349-54). He was a clever, cultivated man,\r\ninterested in letters. He employed scholars to prepare a commentary on\r\nthe \"Divine Comedy,\" and by urgent persuasion induced Petrarch to take\r\nup his abode at Milan. On the archbishop's death his three nephews\r\nsucceeded jointly to the signory. As one of these three nephews, Bernabo\r\n(1354-85), illustrates the moral degeneracy of the tyrant we will glance\r\nat his habits. Bernabo was addicted to the chase. Nobody else was\r\nallowed to keep a dog, but he kept five thousand. These he billeted on\r\nthe citizens of Milan. Every fortnight the masters of his kennels made\r\ntheir rounds; if the dogs were too thin, a fine was imposed; if dead, a\r\ngeneral confiscation. If a man killed a wild boar or a hare, he was\r\nmaimed or hanged, or sometimes, in mercy, merely obliged to eat the\r\nquarry raw. Bernabo was afraid of conspiracies and rebellion. No man\r\nmight go out into the street after dark for any cause whatever, under\r\npain of having a foot cut off. No man might utter the words \"Guelf\" or\r\n\"Ghibelline,\" under penalty of having his tongue cut out. Once Bernabo\r\nshut up his two secretaries in a cage with a wild boar. On another\r\noccasion a young man who had pulled a policeman's beard was condemned to\r\npay a small fine, but Bernabo ordered his right hand cut off. The\r\n_podesta_ delayed execution of the sentence, so that the lad's parents\r\nmight have time to ask mercy. For this Bernabo caused the lad's two\r\nhands to be cut off and also the _podesta's_ right hand. A sexton who\r\ndemanded too much for digging a grave was buried alive side by side\r\nwith the dead body. Two monks who came to remonstrate with Bernabo for\r\nhis cruelty were burnt alive. Nevertheless, Bernabo protested himself\r\ndevout; he fasted, built churches and monasteries. This amiable man had\r\nthirty-two children. His brother, joint heir of the principality,\r\nGaleazzo II, was of the same stuff, except that in place of piety he\r\nsubstituted an interest in letters; he founded the University of Pavia,\r\nand exchanged figs, flowers, and flattery with Petrarch. Galeazzo's son,\r\nGian Galeazzo (1378-1402), rose still higher in the world; he gave\r\n300,000 sequins to the King of France, and in return received the king's\r\ndaughter in marriage. For a second wife he married his cousin, daughter\r\nof his amiable uncle Bernabo, who thought that this marriage would bind\r\nhis nephew to him by bonds of filial affection. Gian Galeazzo however,\r\nby means of a trick, got his father-in-law within his reach, arrested\r\nhim, accused him of witchcraft, put him in prison and poisoned him, and\r\nso became sole lord of Milan. This worthy lord converted his\r\nprincipality into a dukedom and became duke (1395); but as we have\r\nfollowed the family to the end of the century, and long enough to make\r\nourselves acquainted with the habits of tyrants, we must leave them.\r\n\r\nPoor Italy suffering from these three evils, plagues, _condottieri_, and\r\ntyrants, naturally sought for a cure, and, with what seems to us a\r\nsingular lack of imagination, turned to the old remedies, Emperor and\r\nPope. From time to time Emperors came into Italy, but the Hapsburgs were\r\nvery different from the Hohenstaufens, and their trips to Rome were\r\nmere money-getting excursions. They sold privileges and honours, imposed\r\nwhat taxes they could collect, and sneaked back to Germany. Obviously\r\nthere was no hope from Emperors. Then rose the cry for the return of the\r\nPapacy. Every Italian, however he might hate or despise the Popes, felt\r\nproud that the Papacy was an Italian institution, and believed that\r\nevery Pope, good or bad, should live in Rome and sit on his throne at\r\nSt. Peter's. Sentiment grew strong, especially among the women; Petrarch\r\nthundered, St. Catherine of Siena pleaded. Moreover, the sharper\r\nargument was urged with great practical effect, that the Papal State\r\nmight shake off the papal dominion if the Pontiffs did not look after it\r\nthemselves. The Popes began to stir uneasily. The cardinals indeed,\r\naccustomed to the safe city of Avignon, did not care to go to turbulent\r\nRome, or perhaps, as Petrarch said, they could not bear to leave their\r\nBurgundian wines. But finally Gregory XI (1370-78) raised his courage to\r\nthe sticking point. He returned to Rome in 1377, and the Babylonish\r\nCaptivity of seventy years ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nA BIRD'S-EYE VIEW (1350-1450)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe return of the Papacy to Rome was an event of importance both for\r\nItaly and the Catholic Church. Had it remained in France, it must have\r\ndwindled and shrunk, like Antaeus, kept away from its source of strength.\r\nNevertheless, the Papacy was no longer what it once had been; it cannot\r\nserve us now as a central channel for the course of Italian history, and\r\nwill rank no higher than the first of half-a-dozen little channels,\r\nwhich we must pursue separately.\r\n\r\nThe returning Pope found his territory in greater obedience than he\r\ndeserved; for a brilliant Spanish cardinal, Albornoz who had been sent\r\nsome time before had reduced almost all the cities to subjection\r\n(1353-67); even Bologna, successfully disputed with the Visconti,\r\nacknowledged papal dominion. But there was neither peace nor\r\ntranquillity. Everywhere turbulence and murmurous threatenings rumbled;\r\nand worse was to come. The very year after the return from the\r\nBabylonish Captivity the _Great Schism_ rent the Church asunder for\r\nforty years. There were two parties in the College of Cardinals, the\r\nFrench and the Italian, with little love lost between them. The Italians\r\nwere in control and elected Urban VI (1378-89), a domineering, cruel,\r\nmost unpastoral person, who insulted the foreign cardinals, and so\r\nangered them that they left Rome, declared his election illegal, and\r\nelected one of themselves as Pope in his stead. This anti-pope, attended\r\nby his troop of cardinals, returned to Avignon. Christian Europe divided\r\nin two: some countries recognized Urban, others recognized the\r\nanti-pope. Thus the schism began, and prepared the way for the next\r\ngreat split of Christian Europe into Catholics and Protestants. There\r\nwere now two sources of apostolic succession, two supreme rulers, and\r\ntwo systems of taxation. Misbehaviour and confusion at the top lowered\r\nthe moral tone of the whole Church. The Curia in Rome was scandalously\r\nvenal. Indulgences were sold; offices were bestowed for money. Nobody in\r\nRome respected the Pope, hardly anybody respected the clergy.\r\n\r\nAll Christendom felt that reformation was necessary, and that, first of\r\nall, the schism must be closed. Thereupon some outward deference was\r\npaid to public opinion; the Roman Pope went so far as to make ostensible\r\novertures to his rival at Avignon, and he of Avignon bowed and smiled\r\nmost politely in return. Friendly greetings went to and fro, and a\r\nmeeting was talked of. It became obvious, however, after a time, that\r\nneither Pope had the slightest intention of abdicating in the other's\r\nfavour. Christendom remained insistent, and the two batches of cardinals\r\ntook the matter into their own hands. They held a Council at Pisa, which\r\ndeposed both Popes, and elected a third (1409), but, as the other two\r\nPopes refused to acknowledge their deposition, matters were worse than\r\nbefore. The situation recalled the old days when a German Emperor had\r\ncome down to Rome and had deposed three rival Popes together. The need\r\nseemed to revive the past. The Emperor Sigismund (1410-37) assumed to\r\nspeak as the head of Christendom. He summoned an Ecumenical Council to\r\nmeet at the city of Constance, on the Lake of Constance, to judge the\r\nschismatic quarrel and to consider the general state of the Church.\r\nOther troubles besides schism had begun to appear. The failure of Rome\r\nto satisfy the conscience of Europe had borne fruit. Heresy had\r\nappeared. In England, Wyclif (1327-84) had denounced the higher clergy\r\nfor greed and arrogance; he had disavowed allegiance to the divided\r\nPapacy, and had opposed the doctrine of transubstantiation. In Bohemia,\r\nJerome of Prague rejected the temporal jurisdiction of priests, and John\r\nHuss asserted that Constantine had done great wrong when he endowed Pope\r\nSilvester with lands and temporal power.\r\n\r\nChristendom responded to the Emperor's call. Prelates and scholars of\r\nthe highest character and standing assembled at Constance (1414). It was\r\na great occasion, and belongs to the history of Europe. This Council,\r\nthe seventeenth Ecumenical Council of the Christian Church (1414-18),\r\ndeposed all three Popes, and elected a Roman, of the House of Colonna,\r\nMartin V (1417-31), and so closed the schism and restored unity to the\r\nChurch. The more difficult matter of crushing heresy was not so readily\r\ndealt with. The two reformers, Jerome of Prague and John Huss, refused\r\nto recant or modify their views. They were condemned and handed over to\r\nthe secular arm for punishment; and the Emperor, heedless of the\r\nsafe-conduct he had given, burnt them at the stake (1415-16).\r\n\r\nTo follow the proceedings of this interesting Council more fully would\r\ntake us too far into papal affairs. It must suffice to say that the\r\nReformation can be sniffed in the air. Rome had not done its elementary\r\nduties as head of Christendom, and Christendom insisted on a change and\r\non reform; but Rome was powerful and would not submit. Two parties\r\nappear, the reformers and the papists. The former wished to purify the\r\nRoman Curia and the whole Church, and to give the Papacy a republican\r\ncharacter,--to make the Pope a president, as it were, and the College of\r\nCardinals a senate. The latter liked the old easy ways and wished the\r\nPope to be absolute monarch. The papal party by dexterous politics\r\nfoiled the plans of the reformers and prevented change of any kind,\r\nalthough no doubt it acted less from desire to obstruct reform than to\r\nprevent the anti-monarchical party from getting control of the Church\r\nand using the prestige of reform to attack the papal autocracy. From\r\nthis time on the papal party consistently pursued this course, and\r\ntherefore reformation came not from Rome, but from Germany, and instead\r\nof being a reform from within, came practically as an attack from\r\nwithout, and caused the permanent schism of the Reformation. We must now\r\nleave the Papacy, which follows its wilful course--via Babylonish\r\nAbsenteeism, Schism, and refusal to reform--and steers directly towards\r\nthe rocks of the Reformation, and betake ourselves to the other parts of\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom of Naples would have been badly off at best under its\r\nlight-mannered queen, Joan I (1343-81), but it became involved in the\r\npapal schism, and got into a wretched plight. The queen rashly took\r\nsides with the Avignon Pope, and the irascible Roman Pope vowed\r\nvengeance. He set her cousin, Charles, who belonged to the Durazzo\r\nbranch of the House of Anjou, on the throne in her stead. The story is a\r\nmiserable mixture of treasons, battles, and vulgar crimes. Charles got\r\npossession of the unfortunate queen and strangled her, and he and his\r\nheirs fought her adopted heirs for years. Each side hired mercenaries.\r\nJohn Hawkwood was there, and other notable leaders. Poor Naples, taxed,\r\nrobbed, and ravaged by rival kings, their favourites, and mistresses,\r\nrolled rapidly from bad to worse. Exception must be made in favour of\r\nCharles's son Ladislaus (1390-1414), a bold, enterprising soldier, who\r\nplayed a part in the affairs of Italy like that of his ancestor, Charles\r\nof Anjou. But he failed in not leaving a son to inherit the crown, and\r\nwas succeeded by his sister, another Queen Joan (1414-35), likewise\r\nlight-mannered. There is nothing memorable to grace her career, except\r\nthe presence of a soldier of fortune, once a Romagnol peasant, Muzio\r\nAttendolo, better known as Attendolo Sforza (strength). His son was\r\nFrancesco Sforza, destined to a brilliant career in Milan. The queen did\r\none thing, however, for which we, who clutch at any unification of\r\nItalian history, must thank her. She adopted, not wholly of her free\r\nwill, Alfonso of Aragon, King of Sicily, and so brought about, though\r\nfor a few years only, the reunion of the Two Sicilies.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Sicily we need say nothing except that the royal House,\r\nwhich still had a strain of Hohenstaufen-Norman blood, died out, and\r\nthat Sicily passed as a marriage portion to the crown of Aragon, and\r\nbecame a mere appanage of that kingdom (1409). Finally, as I have said,\r\nKing Alfonso was adopted as heir to the second Queen Joan, and took part\r\nin the civil wars that devastated Naples. Then began the long struggle\r\nof Spaniard against Frenchman (the Neapolitan House of Anjou was still\r\nFrench), which was destined to be so disastrous to Italy. Alfonso\r\nconquered and was acknowledged King of the Two Sicilies by his suzerain\r\nthe Pope (1443). Thus for a time the Southern Kingdom was united and at\r\npeace. It is a happy moment to leave it and go northward, in the hope of\r\nfinding greater moral and intellectual activity, if not greater\r\ntranquillity and order.\r\n\r\nTo the northeast, Venice had been growing in power; but with the growth\r\nof her power the number of her enemies and their bitterness towards her\r\nhad grown. Her possessions on the mainland, wrested from Verona, brought\r\nher into hostility with Padua; her Adriatic possessions, Istria and\r\nDalmatia, made her an enemy of Hungary; her coastwise empire and trade\r\nin the Levant made Genoa her deadly rival; and her imperial expansion\r\nentangled her in war after war. Both the war with Padua and that with\r\nHungary told upon her, but the struggle with Genoa was far worse. During\r\nthe last grapple, known as the war of Chioggia (1378-81), Venice was\r\nreduced to narrow straits, and but for her great admirals, Vettor Pisani\r\nand Carlo Zeno, would have been defeated. Genoa never recovered from the\r\nlosses she sustained; but Venice regained her strength, and renewed her\r\nconquests on the mainland. She conquered Padua (1404) and strangled the\r\nlast heirs of the House of Carrara, though they were prisoners of war;\r\nshe seized Verona, and set a price on the heads of the last of the\r\nScaligers, though they had been her allies. Her chief expansion on the\r\nmainland of Italy was under the Doge Francesco Foscari (1423-57), when\r\nshe annexed Bergamo and Brescia, and carried her western boundary to the\r\nriver Adda. For the sake of convenience we may divide the life of Venice\r\ninto four stages: first, her lusty youth, which closed with the\r\nprofligate capture of Constantinople and the piratical dismemberment of\r\nthe Byzantine Empire (1204); second, her vigorous prime, which lasted\r\ntill she annexed Italian territory, threw in her lot with Italy, and\r\nfrom being almost an Oriental outsider became an Italian state (1338);\r\nthird, her glorious maturity, which continued till the League of\r\nCambrai, when almost all Europe united to destroy her (1508); and\r\nfourth, her long period of ebbing fortune, during which she slipped\r\nslowly into decrepitude. In the present chapter we deal with the earlier\r\npart of her maturity, when Venice was contesting with Milan for primacy\r\nin power and importance.\r\n\r\nDuring all this period the oligarchy had been tightening its hold on the\r\ngovernment, and was now absolute and secure. One last attempt had been\r\nmade to overthrow it, but had easily been put down. No one knows exactly\r\nwhat led to the conspiracy, or what was the exact purpose of the\r\nconspirators. The ringleader was the Doge himself, Marino Faliero, one\r\nof the old nobility. The story is that he wished to revenge himself for\r\na gross insult from a young nobleman, and it seems likely that a\r\npersonal quarrel had some connection with a general plot which aimed to\r\noverthrow the oligarchy, and substitute a government of the old nobility\r\nsupported by the people. The plot was betrayed. Nine of the conspirators\r\nwere hanged from the windows of the Ducal Palace. Faliero's head was cut\r\noff, his portrait in the hall of the Ducal Palace was painted out, and\r\nin the blank space was written: \"This is the place of Marino Faliero,\r\nbeheaded for his crimes.\"\r\n\r\nThe oligarchy did not fail in its duty to itself, but neither did it\r\nfail in its duty to the state. Commerce was the life of Venice; and the\r\noligarchy tended it with the utmost care. The famous Venetian arsenal\r\nwas the foster-mother of that commerce. There the money-getting ships\r\nwere built and equipped: caracks with three decks and great depth of\r\nhold, galleasses with high forecastle and poop, galleys with long rows\r\nof oars and lateen sails, all of different builds to suit the rough\r\nAtlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, or the safer Adriatic.\r\n\r\nRiches, a firm rule, and the security of an island home, showed visibly\r\nin Venice. Instead of fortresses with massive walls and solid towers,\r\nlight, elegant palaces, decked with gay balconies and incrusting\r\nmarbles, lined the canals. All revealed tranquillity and prosperity; and\r\nthe adoption of Gothic architecture in place of Byzantine, and in\r\nespecial the long Gothic arcades of the Ducal Palace (1300-40),\r\ntestified how Venice had turned her face from the East to the West. In\r\ncontrast with Sicily and Naples, rolling down hill separately or\r\ntogether, and with the troubled Papal States, Venice appears altogether\r\nhappy and successful as she passes from the fourteenth into the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nMilan we have brought to the dignity of a dukedom, for which Gian\r\nGaleazzo Visconti (1378-1402), the amiable nephew of the too-confiding\r\nBernabo, paid the price of 100,000 sequins to the fount of honour, the\r\nultramontane Emperor. This nephew, despite a moral inadequacy in his\r\nfamily relations, was in many respects an excellent ruler. He reduced\r\nthe more burdensome taxes (in one city, it is said, he cut them down\r\nfrom 12,000 florins to 400), and abolished others altogether. He\r\ncorrected abuses, reorganized the administration of justice, and enacted\r\nwise laws. He understood the pride of the Milanese in their city, and\r\nlaid the foundations of the great Gothic cathedral on a scale to gratify\r\nthat pride; he began the beautiful church of the Cistercian monks, the\r\n_Certosa_, at Pavia; he completed the palace at Pavia, whither he\r\ntransported his famous collection of books and an equally famous\r\ncollection of holy bones. He had the family ambition, and annexed\r\nVicenza, Verona, Padua, Siena, Assisi, Perugia, Pisa, and Bologna.\r\nRumour said that he aspired to a kingdom of Lombardy, and even of all\r\nItaly. But Venice and Florence were too powerful for the success of his\r\nplans. Venice, perhaps, might have regarded herself as still too much\r\ndetached from Italy to care to oppose him single-handed; but the doughty\r\nburghers of Florence were zealously democratic and would not endure any\r\nsuggestion of foreign dominion. They had fought the Pope, when they\r\nsuspected him of designs on their city, and now they organized a league\r\nagainst Gian Galeazzo. Perhaps it would have been a most fortunate thing\r\nfor Italy if the Duke of Milan had been able to consolidate all Italy,\r\nor even all the North, in one kingdom. Centuries of suffering, of\r\nignominy, of foreign domination might have been avoided; but then,\r\nperhaps, the great intellectual harvest, that gave Italy for the third\r\ntime primacy over Europe, would not have attained its full growth. These\r\nare idle speculations, for Gian Galeazzo died in his prime (1402), and\r\nthe universal dominion of Milan became an academic question.\r\nNevertheless, one cannot withhold a sensation of regret. There was\r\nundoubted brilliance in Gian Galeazzo; whatever he did was done royally.\r\nHis ambitions were high, planned always on a large scale. His purchases\r\nof the French king's daughter and of the ducal title were splendidly\r\nprodigal. The design of the cathedral was noble and bold. It was an\r\nendeavour to give the Gothic style an Italian character. In this it is\r\neasy to find symbolism. The Gothic style represented the Ghibelline\r\ncause, as well as Teutonic blood and influence, whereas the Italian\r\nrepresented the Guelf cause and also Latin blood. The high-aspiring Gian\r\nGaleazzo wished to use both Teutonic and Italian elements as the\r\nmaterials for his kingdom. In view of his intellectual gifts, one\r\nreadily slurs over his moral inadequacy, if that term may be applied to\r\ntraits which would have done honour to Iago; in fact, prior to Caesar\r\nBorgia, he was the most distinguished example of the type of\r\nintellectual, murderous Italian, which exercised so powerful an\r\nattraction over the wild fancy of the Elizabethan dramatists.\r\n\r\nGian Galeazzo's death left his dukedom in a chaotic condition. A widow,\r\na regent committee, and three boys were left to see the state, built up\r\nwith so much care and astuteness, fall away piecemeal into the hands of\r\nthe petty despots, who had been dispossessed during the process of\r\nintegration. Venice took Verona, Padua, and other cities near by; the\r\nPapacy got back Bologna, Florence managed to secure Pisa. Thus the\r\ndukedom was carved up. The eldest son died soon, leaving behind him a\r\nmemory of the pleasure he took in watching mastiffs tear his prisoners\r\nto pieces; but the second son, Filippo Maria (1412-47), inherited his\r\nfather's craft and much of his ability. By means of two famous\r\n_condottieri_, Carmagnola, best remembered as the victim of Venetian\r\nanger, and Francesco Sforza, of whom we have heard in the Neapolitan\r\nservice, he gradually restored the dukedom very nearly to its boundaries\r\nunder his father. Filippo Maria was the last of his race, and we will\r\nleave him, engaged in speculation as to the best political use of his\r\nmarriageable daughter Bianca Maria.\r\n\r\nWe must pass over the Counts of Savoy, now become dukes (1416), the\r\nmarquesses of Monferrat and Saluzzo, and the lords of other petty\r\nterritories, and turn our attention to Florence. Florence was always in\r\na state of struggle, always engaged in exiling, deposing, or in some way\r\nsuppressing aristocrats. Forced, in days of peril, to receive foreign\r\nlords as military leaders, she had managed to expel the last of them,\r\none Walter of Brienne, a clever knave, who bore the odd title of Duke of\r\nAthens, which he had inherited from his grandfather, one of the\r\ngentlemen adventurers who had gone to the East. His father had been\r\nexpelled from Athens, and the son was happily driven out of Florence.\r\nThe burghers followed up their victory (1343) with new laws against the\r\naristocrats, and held the government for a generation. Then first\r\nappears the name of Medici. One Salvestro dei Medici, as _Gonfaloniere_\r\nof Justice, the supreme officer in Florence under the existing\r\nconstitution, proposed further laws in favour of the people. The lower\r\nclasses, with whetted appetites, wanted more. The mechanics and artisans\r\nof the lower guilds, and more particularly the wool carders and combers\r\n(the _Ciompi_) of the great wool guilds, rose in riot, overturned the\r\ngovernment, and put a wool-carder, Michele di Lando, at the head of the\r\ncity (1378). Florence was democratic, but not so democratic as to submit\r\nto the rule of a wool-carder. The rich burghers would not stomach a\r\nplebeian any more than they would a king. A reaction set in, and the\r\ngovernment passed into the very competent hands of an oligarchy of\r\ndistinguished citizens. This oligarchy governed well. Its leaders, Maso\r\ndegli Albizzi, and Niccolo da Uzzano, acted patriotically and wisely.\r\nThey resisted the aggressions of Milan from the north, and of Naples\r\n(under that exceptional king Ladislaus) from the south, and made it\r\ntheir policy to maintain the balance of power in Italy. Under this\r\noligarchy began the great development of art, known as the Renaissance,\r\nor, to be more exact in quoting the textbooks, the First or Early\r\nRenaissance. To that subject, which shall give us for a time at least a\r\ncentre, and save us from these puzzling political subdivisions, we\r\njoyfully proceed; only remembering that at this period Italy has these\r\nmain political divisions,--the Kingdom of Sicily, the Kingdom of Naples\r\n(the two temporarily reunited), the Papal States, the city of Florence,\r\nthe duchy of Milan, and the city of Venice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY RENAISSANCE (1400-1450)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Renaissance, new birth, we mean the rapid, many-sided, intellectual\r\ndevelopment which started forward in Italy at this time. It was really a\r\nstage in the movement which began a hundred years earlier, but the\r\ntextbooks confine the term Renaissance to the period which began at the\r\nopening of the fifteenth century; and just as the first beginning took\r\nplace in Florence, so this fresh start, like a stream of energy issuing\r\nat a divine touch, also burst out of the city of Florence. The simplest\r\nway to get an idea of this period, known as the Early Renaissance, will\r\nbe to notice a few of the men, leaders in their several spheres, in whom\r\nthat energy became incarnate.\r\n\r\nWe must not let ourselves think that the Renaissance was a merely\r\nartistic movement. A few men are known to us, and we think of them as\r\nwandering about in artistic isolation, as if they were hermits in a\r\nThebaid. But, in reality, only a slight fraction of even the deeper\r\nfeelings and interests take artistic or literary form; the great\r\nmajority are put into life. The celebrated Florentine artists of those\r\ndays were merely representative of their fellows; they were surrounded\r\nby crowds of neighbours, all crammed full with ardour for living, for\r\nexpression, for discussion, for money-making, for glorifying their\r\ncity. In recognition of this fact, and of the great service rendered to\r\nthe arts throughout the Renaissance by men who were not artists, but\r\npotent signors of wealth and cultivation, whether merchants, dukes, or\r\ncardinals, I take Cosimo dei Medici (1389-1464) as the first figure in\r\nthis brief account of the Early Renaissance.\r\n\r\nCosimo's father, the richest banker in Italy, and one of the chief\r\ncitizens of Florence, had been active in politics, and chief of the\r\nparty which was opposed to the ruling oligarchy. Cosimo succeeded to his\r\nfather's position, and when the oligarchy fell became the actual head of\r\nthe city, though he always affected the role of private citizen. His\r\nquick intelligence and his broad cultivation gave him keen sympathy with\r\nthe fermenting intellectual life about him, and his great wealth enabled\r\nhim to express that sympathy in most substantial ways. He got his first\r\nschooling from a Florentine humanist, and then went abroad, travelled in\r\nGermany and France, and visited the Council of Constance then in\r\nsession. After that his attention was devoted to business and to\r\npolitical affairs. His position in Florence during early manhood was\r\nalways precarious, for the sharp-witted Florentines were not easily\r\nhoodwinked and saw whither Cosimo's masterfulness was tending. For a\r\ntime he was in exile, but after a tussle he won his place and banished\r\nhis enemies. Wealth was his great instrument. He lent and gave lavishly.\r\nIn later life he used to say that his chief error had been that he had\r\nnot begun to spend money ten years sooner than he did. He was a serious\r\nman, given to intellectual matters, and averse to buffoons and strolling\r\nplayers, so popular then; by virtue of wide experience in the conduct of\r\nlarge affairs, of extensive reading, of a retentive memory, and a\r\nnatural gift for language, he was both an interesting talker and good\r\ncompany. He talked literature with men of letters, but he was equally\r\nready to talk divinity, in which he was well read, or philosophy, or\r\nastrology in which he believed although some men did not. He liked\r\ngardening, and enjoyed going out of town to his country-place; there he\r\nwould prune the vines for two hours in the morning, and then go indoors\r\nto read. His connection with the arts of the Renaissance, however, is\r\nour chief concern. He employed the famous architect Michelozzo to build\r\nhis palace, now known as Palazzo Riccardi, his villa, and also the\r\nDominican convent of San Marco. He employed the still more famous\r\nBrunelleschi to rebuild the abbey of Fiesole. He was fond of sculptors,\r\nespecially of Donatello, and had statues by the best masters of the day\r\nin his palace. He employed Fra Angelico to paint in the convent of San\r\nMarco, and Benozzo Gozzoli in his private chapel. Benozzo painted a\r\nprocession of the Three Wise Men, with Cosimo, his son, and his\r\ngrandson, young Lorenzo the Magnificent, riding in their train. Cosimo's\r\ngreatest interest, however, was in the humanities. He built several\r\nbuildings for libraries in Florence, and one in Venice, and interested\r\nhimself greatly in the preservation and increase of the libraries\r\nthemselves. For the library in the abbey at Fiesole he employed a man\r\nof letters (Vespasiano da Bisticci, his biographer), who hired\r\nforty-five copyists, and in twenty-two months finished the two hundred\r\nvolumes deemed necessary for a good library. His list included the Bible\r\nand concordances and commentaries, beginning with that by Origen; the\r\nworks of St. Ignatius, St. Basil, St. Gregory Nazianzen, St. John\r\nChrysostom, and all the works of the Greek fathers which had been\r\ntranslated into Latin; St. Cyprian, Tertullian, and the four doctors of\r\nthe Latin Church; the mediaeval masters St. Bernard, Hugo of St. Victor,\r\nSt. Anselm, St. Isidore of Spain; the scholastic philosophers, Albertus\r\nMagnus, Alexander of Hales, Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventura; Aristotle, and\r\ncommentaries; books of canon law; the Latin prose classics, Livy, Caesar,\r\nSuetonius, Plutarch, Sallust, Quintus Curtius, Valerius Maximus, Cicero,\r\nSeneca; the Latin poets, Virgil, Terence, Ovid, Lucan, Statius, Plautus;\r\nand \"all the other books necessary to a library.\" One wonders if this\r\nclause includes Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, or whether the humanists\r\ndid not regard them as necessary or appropriate to culture.\r\n\r\nTaken altogether Cosimo may stand as an heroic model of the Florentine\r\nburgher, such as one sees in the frescoes of the time, shrewd, prudent,\r\nthoughtful, cautious in plan and prompt in action, interested in the\r\nbest things of this world, and in a measure generous, but wholly without\r\nromance, chivalry, or idealism. At the close of his life he used to stay\r\nhours at a time, wrapt in thought, without speaking a word. One of the\r\nwomen of the house asked him the reason of this. He answered: \"When you\r\nhave to go out of town, you spend a fortnight all agog to prepare for\r\ngoing; and now that I have to go from this life to another, doesn't it\r\nseem to you that I have something to think about?\" The last book he is\r\nreported by his biographer to have read was the \"Ethics\" of Aristotle.\r\n\r\nCosimo was named _Pater Patriae_, though his real work was the foundation\r\nof the House of the Medici, which ruled in Tuscany for centuries and\r\nmingled its blood with the royalties of Europe; but for us he is the\r\npatron of the arts, the friend of artists, and serves as the central\r\nfigure round which to group the men of artistic genius.\r\n\r\nIn architecture the greatest name is that of Brunelleschi (1377-1446).\r\nHis biography by Vasari opens with these words: \"Many men are created by\r\nnature little in person and features, who have their souls so full of\r\ngreatness and their hearts so full of the inordinate fury of genius,\r\nthat, unless they are at work on things difficult to impossibility, and\r\nunless they finish them to the astonishment of the spectator, they never\r\ngive themselves any rest all their lives; and whatever things chance\r\nputs into their hands, no matter how mean and cheap, they bring to worth\r\nand dignity.... Such was Brunelleschi, no less insignificant in person\r\nthan Giotto, but of so lofty genius, that it may be said he was endowed\r\nby heaven to give new form to architecture, which for hundreds of years\r\nhad gone astray [such was the Renaissance view of the Gothic and\r\nRomanesque]. Moreover, Brunelleschi was adorned with the greatest\r\nvirtues; among which was friendship to such a degree, that there never\r\nwas a man more kind or more loving than he. His judgment was wholly free\r\nfrom passion; wherever he saw the worth of another man's merits, he\r\ntotally disregarded any advantage to himself or to his friends. He knew\r\nhimself; he inspired others with his own noble qualities, and he always\r\nsuccoured his neighbour in time of need. He declared himself a deadly\r\nenemy of the vices, and a lover of those who practised virtue. He never\r\nwasted time, for he was always busy with his own affairs or with the\r\naffairs of others when they had need of him, and when out walking he\r\nused to stop and see his friends and always lent them a hand.\"\r\nBrunelleschi was no scholar, but, being a Florentine, he was very fond\r\nof talking, and did not hesitate to take part in conversation with\r\nlearned men, especially when the talk ran on Holy Writ, and then, as a\r\nfriend said, he talked like a second St. Paul.\r\n\r\nHe began life, as most architects did, as a member of the guild of\r\ngoldsmiths, and learned to model, but he had a bent towards physics and\r\nmechanics, and developed naturally into an architect. A great event in\r\nhis life was a trip to Rome with Donatello; there the two examined all\r\nthe classical remains in the city and in the country round about, taking\r\nmeasurements and learning all they could.\r\n\r\nIn Florence besides the abbey of Fiesole, built for Cosimo, Brunelleschi\r\nbuilt the church of San Lorenzo for Cosimo's father, and he designed and\r\nbegan the lordly Pitti palace across the Arno, but his great\r\nachievement was the dome of the cathedral. The cathedral, first begun by\r\nArnolfo di Cambio, had been in charge of a succession of famous\r\narchitects, and was nearing completion; but the gap at the intersection\r\nof the nave and transepts presented a most difficult architectural\r\nproblem. The diameter of this gap was about one hundred and thirty-five\r\nfeet, and the height above the ground was about one hundred and\r\nforty-five feet. No such span had been vaulted since the building of the\r\nPantheon. A public competition for a dome was held in which Brunelleschi\r\ntook part. After long discussion, for Florence was \"a city where every\r\none speaks his mind,\" and after much consideration, Brunelleschi was\r\nchosen architect. His great dome, though no copy of Roman forms, was\r\nthoroughly classic in its simplicity and its spirit, and is the great\r\nachievement of the Early Renaissance in architecture.\r\n\r\nBrunelleschi and his fellow architects, no doubt, wished to revive the\r\nold Roman art, and did so as far as they could, but their problems were\r\nnew and their models few, so they were forced, in the main, to follow\r\ntheir own principles of construction and limit their use of Roman forms\r\nto ornament and detail. Other famous men seconded Brunelleschi; and\r\nFlorentine, or at least Tuscan, architects spread the ideas of the new\r\nart. To them is really due the foundation of the various schools of\r\nRenaissance architecture which sprang up in Milan, Venice, Pavia,\r\nBologna, Rimini, Brescia, Siena, Lucca, Perugia, and in almost every\r\ncity of Northern Italy.\r\n\r\nIn sculpture, the puissant Donatello (1386-1466) is the greatest\r\nfigure. It has been said, that Michelangelo's soul first worked in\r\nDonatello's body or that Donatello's soul lived again in Michelangelo.\r\nDonatello was a realist; he shows classic influence at times, in\r\ntechnique and in sundry bits of detail, but his instinct was to imitate\r\nwhat he could see and touch. His vigour, his energy and variety produced\r\na profound effect on sculpture and also on painting. His earlier works\r\nwere statues for the outside of the Campanile and of the church of\r\nOrsanmichele, of which the most famous are that known as _Zuccone_,\r\nBaldhead, and the splendid St. George. Afterwards he modelled a young\r\nDavid, the first nude bronze since the Romans, and the statue of\r\nGattamelata at Padua, the first equestrian statue since that of Marcus\r\nAurelius in Rome. The spectator who examines the collection of\r\nDonatello's works in the Bargello is chiefly struck by his intellectual\r\npower, and by the immense variety of his style, from the simple outline\r\nof the lovely St. Cecilia in low relief, to the passionate dramas carved\r\nin altars and pulpits.\r\n\r\nDonatello was a great friend of Brunelleschi, and Vasari tells this\r\nanecdote about them. Donatello modelled a Crucifix for Santa Croce, and\r\nthinking he had done something unusually good, asked Brunelleschi what\r\nhe thought of it. Brunelleschi, with his unswerving artistic rectitude,\r\nanswered that Donatello had put a peasant on the cross, and not Jesus\r\nChrist. Donatello, piqued more than he had anticipated, said: \"If it\r\nwere as easy to model as it is to criticise, my Christ would seem to you\r\na Christ and not a peasant; but let's see you take a piece of wood and\r\ngo and make one.\" Brunelleschi did so secretly, and when he had at last\r\nfinished his Crucifix, asked Donatello to come home and dine with him.\r\nThey walked to Brunelleschi's house together, stopping at the market to\r\nbuy eggs, cheese, and other things for the dinner. Then Brunelleschi\r\nsaid, \"Donatello, you take these things and go to my house, and I will\r\ncome after in a minute or two.\" So Donatello caught them up in his\r\napron, went to Brunelleschi's, opened the door, and saw the Crucifix. He\r\nwas so dumbfounded that he dropped the dinner on the floor, and when\r\nBrunelleschi, coming in, said, \"Why, Donatello, what shall we have for\r\ndinner?\" Donatello answered, \"For my part I have had my share to-day. If\r\nyou want yours, pick it up. No more of that. It is my lot to model\r\npeasants, and yours to model Christs.\"\r\n\r\nDonatello was also a great friend of Cosimo's, modelled many things for\r\nhim, and inspired Cosimo with a taste for collecting antiques. He loved\r\nCosimo so much that he did whatever he wanted, except when it interfered\r\nwith his personal idiosyncrasies. One day Cosimo gave Donatello, who\r\nused to go about in his workman's blouse, a cloak and a fine suit of\r\nclothes, the costume of a gentleman. Donatello wore them for a day or\r\ntwo, and then said he could not wear them, they were too fashionable. He\r\nwas buried, at his own request, near Cosimo, in the church of San\r\nLorenzo, which Brunelleschi had designed, and he had adorned with his\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nDonatello worked in Venice, Mantua, Modena, Ferrara, and Prato, spent\r\nseveral years in Siena, and nine in Padua, and introduced the\r\nRenaissance into the sculpture of Northern Italy. He was a man of strong\r\ncharacter and poetic spirit, striving in his statues to be true to\r\nnature and to the beautiful, to mingle pagan and Christian notions,\r\ntradition, and freedom. He and his pupils affected the whole plastic art\r\nof Italy.\r\n\r\nIn painting, Masaccio (1401-28) stands conspicuous, even among many\r\npainters of rare gifts. Modern critics call him Giotto reincarnate.\r\nMasaccio is an unflattering nickname for Tommaso, and recalls the only\r\npersonal trait we know of him. Vasari says: \"He was a most absent-minded\r\nperson and very casual, like a man who has fixed his will and his whole\r\nmind on art only, and cares little about himself and less about others.\r\nHe never wanted to think in any way about the things or the cares of\r\nthis world, even of his own clothes, and he never went to get the money\r\ndue him from his debtors except when he was in extreme need. Instead of\r\nThomas, everybody called him Masaccio; not because he was bad, being\r\ngood nature itself, but because of his great absent-mindedness.\r\nNevertheless, he was as affectionate in doing useful and amiable acts\r\nfor other people as could possibly be wished.\" This \"marvellous boy\"\r\ndied at the age of twenty-seven, but left an ineffaceable mark on\r\nItalian painting. Across the Arno, in the ugly church of Santa Maria del\r\nCarmine, is a chapel on the right, in which, mingled with the work of\r\ncontemporaries and continuers, are Masaccio's frescoes, figures of St.\r\nPeter and St. John, of a shivering boy, and a few others. Leonardo da\r\nVinci said: \"After Giotto, the art of painting declined again, because\r\nevery one imitated the pictures that were already done; thus it went on\r\ntill Tommaso of Florence, nicknamed Masaccio, showed by his perfect\r\nworks how those who take for their standard any one but Nature--the\r\nmistress of all masters--weary themselves in vain.\"[16] In that little\r\nchapel, Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael, and scores of the greatest\r\npainters of Italy have admired, studied, and copied.\r\n\r\nBrunelleschi, Donatello, Masaccio are but the greater names in the fine\r\narts. Well might Leon Battista Alberti, himself a great architect and\r\nhumanist, on return from exile to his native city, say to Brunelleschi:\r\n\"I have been accustomed both to wonder and to grieve that so many divine\r\narts and sciences which we see to have abounded in those most highly\r\nendowed ancients were now lacking and utterly lost ... but since I have\r\nbeen restored to this our native land that surpasseth all others in her\r\nadornment, I have recognized in many but chiefly in thee, Philip\r\n[Brunelleschi], and in our near friend Donato [Donatello] the sculptor,\r\nand in those others, Nencio [Ghiberti], and Luca [della Robbia], and\r\nMasaccio, genius capable for every praiseworthy work, not inferior to\r\nthat of any ancient and famous master in the arts.\"[17]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] _Leonardo da Vinci_, Richter.\r\n\r\n[17] _Church Building in the Middle Ages_, C. E. Norton, p. 280.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE RENAISSANCE (1450-1492)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last chapter confined itself to the fine arts and omitted the main\r\nelement, humanism, which gave volume and impetus to the stream, and,\r\nthough not memorable for conspicuous achievements as the fine arts were,\r\nflowed more directly from the classic impulse and produced the greatest\r\nimmediate effect. The humanists played a part analogous to that which\r\nmen of science play in our own time; they devoted themselves heart and\r\nsoul to the classics, as men of science do to Nature. For some time they\r\nhad had access to the Latin past through Italy, and now they also found\r\ntheir way to the far greater classic world of Greece. The one\r\nuninterrupted communication with that world was through Constantinople,\r\nwhich, like a long, ill-lighted and ill-repaired corridor, led back to\r\nthe great pleasure domes of Plato and Homer, and all the wonderland of\r\nGreek literature and thought. Aristotle, indeed, had come by way of the\r\nArabs, and had long been a lay Bible, but for the other Greek classics\r\nthe rising humanism of Italy was indebted to Constantinople. The glowing\r\nyoung city of Florence lit its torch at the expiring embers of the\r\nimperial city. A few Italians went to Constantinople and learned Greek,\r\nthen stray Byzantines came to Italy. The doom which hung over\r\nConstantinople frightened scholars and drove them westward, and the fall\r\nitself (1453) dispersed the last of them. These Greeks brought\r\ninvaluable manuscripts and firmly established Hellenic culture in the\r\nkindred soil of Tuscany. In the list of books in Cosimo's library, there\r\nwas no mention of any Greek classic except Aristotle; but after the\r\nimmigration of Greek scholars all intellectual Florence went mad over\r\nPlato, and Cosimo founded a Platonic Academy. The study of Greek brought\r\nwith it examination, comparison, criticism; it brought new knowledge; it\r\ngave new ideas to all the arts, new impulses to the creative\r\nimagination, and general intellectual freedom. Interest in the\r\nhumanities became so widespread throughout the peninsula that we get a\r\nfeeling of Italian unity stronger than any we have experienced since the\r\ndays of Theodoric.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the humanists, however, was merely as an intellectual\r\nleaven. They need not be spoken of apart from the general intellectual\r\nmovement which expressed itself so much more fully and freely in art\r\nthan in any other way. That movement kindled enthusiasm from Lombardy to\r\nCalabria; and Florence still maintained her primacy. All the other\r\ncities of Italy lagged far behind her. We must therefore keep Florence\r\nas our paradigm, only remembering that at her heels a score of cities\r\ntoil and pant in artistic eagerness to make themselves as beautiful and\r\nfamous as Florence.\r\n\r\nThere Cosimo, _Pater Patriae_, had died in fulness of years and was\r\nsucceeded by his grandson, Lorenzo the Magnificent, though not\r\nimmediately, for there was a short-lived Piero in between. Lorenzo took\r\nhis grandfather's place, became lord of Florence in all but name, and\r\nstood the centre of a brilliant group of artists, sculptors, poets, and\r\nscholars. His reign, for it must be so called, lasted from 1469 to 1492,\r\na most notable span of time. The mere names of the famous Florentines\r\nwould fill pages. A few must be mentioned: Benedetto da Maiano, sculptor\r\nand architect, who carved the beautiful pulpit in Santa Croce, and drew\r\nthe designs for the palace-fortress of the Strozzi; Giuliano da San\r\nGallo, sculptor and architect, who made the plans for Lorenzo's villa at\r\nPoggio a Caiano; Andrea della Robbia, nephew to Luca, and almost his\r\nequal in the tender charm of his blue and white Madonnas; Mino da\r\nFiesole, who made a bust of Lorenzo's father, and carved in marble the\r\nsweetness of young mothers; Antonio Rossellino, who wrought the famous\r\ntomb for a great Portuguese prelate in the church of San Miniato; Andrea\r\nVerrocchio, who painted the Uffizi Annunciation, so beautiful that it\r\nwas long attributed to Leonardo, modelled the lady _dalle belle mani_ in\r\nthe Bargello, and the Colleoni at Venice, greatest of equestrian\r\nstatues; Benozzo Gozzoli, who painted the three generations of Medici in\r\nthe Riccardi palace, and in the Campo Santo at Pisa the enchanting\r\nfrescoes which turn the Old Testament into a kind of Arabian Nights;\r\nAntonio Pollaiuolo, sculptor and painter, a leader in the new school of\r\nrealism, and notable for the feeling of movement which he conveys;\r\nFilippino Lippi, Lippo Lippi's son, who completed the frescoes in the\r\nchapel in Santa Maria del Carmine left unfinished by Masaccio;\r\nBotticelli, the greatest of all the Florentine painters, except Leonardo\r\nand Michelangelo; Domenico Ghirlandaio, whose frescoes in Santa Maria\r\nNovella tell us more about those shrewd, capable, quick-witted\r\nFlorentines than any historian; Pulci, the poet, who wrote \"Morgante\r\nMaggiore,\" a gay epic, which Savonarola thought ought to be burned;\r\nPoliziano, great embodiment of culture, who wrote the first lyrical\r\ntragedy, and led the way towards the opera; Marsilio Ficino, the\r\nphilosopher who helped Cosimo found the Platonic Academy; Pico della\r\nMirandola, the charming scholar, whom Machiavelli called \"a man almost\r\ndivine.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps none of these men were equal to the leaders in the group which\r\nsurrounded Cosimo, but they are more interesting to us, and touch our\r\nsympathy more readily. They are nearer to us. The earlier problems in\r\narchitecture, sculpture, and painting were more difficult, but they had\r\nbeen successfully solved; and the fresh problems, which confronted the\r\nyounger generation, though less adventurous, were more refined. The sons\r\nhave entered into a hard-earned inheritance, and live more freely. They\r\nhave more spiritual alertness than their fathers though less vigour,\r\nmore sensitiveness to passing moods though less robustness, greater\r\nmastery of technique though less genius for principles. Less great\r\nthemselves, they have created greater works. Benedetto's Palazzo Strozzi\r\nis more majestic and splendid than Michelozzo's Palazzo Riccardi;\r\nVerrocchio's statue of Colleoni surpasses Donatello's Gattamelata;\r\nBotticelli's poetry is more interesting, at least to the unlearned, than\r\nMasaccio's puissant drawing. Nevertheless, the greater intimacy of\r\nsympathy and interest which we feel for the later men is not accounted\r\nfor by their greater command of their crafts. There is some new element\r\nless readily discovered. We perceive a change of attitude toward life, a\r\nnew conception of human existence. The readiest explanation and perhaps\r\nthe best, if we do not treat it as completely adequate, lies in the new\r\nGreek thought (or rather Greek thought as the Florentines understood\r\nit), which the humanists contributed to Italian culture; and indeed not\r\nso much in Greek thought itself, as in the impulse it gave to a subtler\r\nand more complicated conception of life.\r\n\r\nDirect Greek influence is most conspicuous in Botticelli. This rare\r\nspirit wandered about half in the world of reality which he ill\r\nunderstood and depicted badly, and half in a world of fantasy which he\r\nknew better than any other painter. The secret of this world of fantasy,\r\nas he discovered, was motion. If a vision tarries, it becomes touched by\r\nthe blight of familiarity, soiled by the comradeship of life. The fairy\r\nspirit of imagination must be ever on the wing. No artist ever let Sweet\r\nFancy loose as Botticelli did in his two great pictures, The Primavera\r\n(Spring) and The Birth of Venus. In them this Greek influence finds its\r\nfullest direct expression. The glory of dawn, the first unveiled fresh\r\nbeauty of the world, which the Greeks saw, Botticelli saw also. But\r\nbesides the childlike joy in pure beauty is another, more complicated,\r\nelement. Into the rapturous Greek world, beautiful with sensuous charm,\r\nthe bewildering idea of a moral order presents itself. On the\r\ncountenance of Venus and in the figure of Primavera there is a\r\nwistfulness, as if they had a presentiment that they must leave the\r\nrose-strewn ocean and the magic wood in which they found themselves. The\r\nconsequence is a sadness as of beholding an antagonism between two\r\nbeautiful things.\r\n\r\nThe subtler and more complicated conception of life is best expressed by\r\nVerrocchio, the other master spirit of this generation, who displays in\r\nhis paintings and statues the joy he takes in pure beauty, but always\r\nadds some other element. The little boy who hugs a dolphin in the court\r\nof the Palazzo Vecchio is the incarnation of the grace and happiness of\r\nchildhood, but he has an impish, Puck-like expression. The young bronze\r\nDavid, who has just conquered Goliath, has an odd, mischievous\r\nsprightliness. Both statues intimate a sceptical attitude towards the\r\nfine seriousness of life which had marked Puritan Florence of the older\r\ndays. His painting of the Annunciation shows a magic background,\r\nbeautiful and mystical, with enchanted cities, rivers, mountains, like\r\nthe part of Xanadu where Kubla Khan decreed his pleasure dome, or the\r\nstrange land where La belle Dame sans Merci left her knight-at-arms\r\nalone and palely loitering. Subtle thoughts play over his statues and\r\npaintings, and he taught his pupil Leonardo that strange and beautiful\r\nfascination of face which expresses one knows not what. The earlier\r\nsimplicity of the _quattrocento_ has passed, the artist's attitude to\r\nlife has become complicated, although the love of beauty for beauty's\r\nsake remains abundantly.\r\n\r\nThe lord of Florence, Lorenzo the Magnificent, the centre and patron of\r\nthis glittering ring, is the best exponent of the late _quattrocento_\r\ntaken as a whole. He touched life on every side, public and private,\r\nintellectual and frivolous, religious and cynical, artistic, literary,\r\nphilosophical. Lorenzo had a striking, indeed a fascinating,\r\npersonality. His figure was strong and lithe, and his face among a\r\nthousand caught the eye. His big jaws, under his lean, furrowed cheeks,\r\nwere square and grim. His long irregular nose and curving lips gave him\r\na somewhat sardonic expression, but his broad forehead was grave and\r\nthoughtful, and \"princely counsel\" shone in his face. His whole aspect\r\nwas full of character and dignity. Every one felt his fascination. He\r\nwas a poet and wrote poems of many kinds, grave and gay, some of which\r\nare of acknowledged merit:\r\n\r\n    Quant'e bella giovinezza\r\n    Che si fugge tuttavia,\r\n    Chi vuol essere lieto, sia,\r\n    Di doman non v'e certezza.[18]\r\n\r\nHe was a scholar, and full of the fashionable admiration for Plato,\r\nthough he probably shared the current confusion between Plato's own\r\nthoughts and those of the Alexandrian Neoplatonists. He was a statesman\r\nof foresight and shrewdness, and contributed more than any one else to\r\npreserve the peace of Italy, by maintaining the balance of power among\r\nthe greater states. He was also a very charming person, and endeavoured\r\nto make life in Florence a happy mixture of mirth and intellectual\r\npleasure; and it must be remembered in appreciation of the general\r\nsobriety of his life, that a gifted company of men did all they could to\r\nspoil him.\r\n\r\nLorenzo was the most remarkable prince of the _quattrocento_, but there\r\nwere many others who patronized scholars and artists as generously as\r\nhe. Alfonso of Aragon, the king who temporarily united the Two Sicilies,\r\nwas devoted to the humanities. He was wont to hear Terence and Virgil\r\nread aloud at dinner, and took Livy with him on his campaigns. But\r\nNaples and Sicily had almost no share in the achievements and glory of\r\nthe Italian Renaissance. Lawless, ignorant, poor, unsuccessful, they\r\nresponded feebly to the efforts of individuals, who, here and there,\r\nstrove to emulate the great Florentines. But in the North all the world\r\nwas mad for art, and its princes led the fashion. Federigo da\r\nMontefeltro, Duke of Urbino (1422-1482), was the foremost scholar among\r\nsoldiers and the foremost soldier among scholars; he gathered together a\r\nnoble library, now lodged in the Vatican; he built a palace, unmatched\r\nin Italy; and collected about him artists of all kinds. Yet Federigo was\r\na soldier by nature as well as by profession, as one may see from the\r\ngreat portrait of him in the Uffizi, painted by Piero della Francesca.\r\nHis strong profile, with firm mouth and big, broken, aquiline nose,\r\ntestifies far more forcibly to his character as a warrior than as a\r\nvirtuoso. His near neighbour, the tyrant of Pesaro (a little city by the\r\nAdriatic coast), Alessandro Sforza, passed the intervals between his\r\nbattles in buying books. Duke Ercole of Ferrara was likewise a patron of\r\nart, and adorned his capital as well as his palaces and villas with all\r\nsorts of beautiful things. The dukes of Milan were somewhat eclipsed,\r\nbut only for a time, by their less powerful rivals of Ferrara and\r\nUrbino. The old ducal line of the Visconti had died out with Filippo\r\nMaria, and Francesco Sforza (husband of Filippo's daughter), who\r\nsucceeded to the duchy (1450), was busy making good his very defective\r\ntitle, and had little time to attend to art or letters. Even he kept\r\nhumanists in his pay, and continued work on the glorious Certosa of\r\nPavia.\r\n\r\nNot only princes but private citizens were lovers and patrons of art. In\r\nalmost every city of the North--excepting Piedmont--there was some\r\nartist of whom the whole city was proud. Nevertheless, throughout the\r\nreign of Lorenzo the Magnificent Florence continued to be the most\r\nintellectual of Italian cities, as she had been for many generations;\r\nbut on Lorenzo's death the primacy in the arts and in matters of the\r\nmind passed from Florence to Rome. By a flattering chance that primacy\r\nseemed to follow the fortunes of a single family. Under Cosimo, Piero,\r\nand Lorenzo dei Medici, the Renaissance may be said to have made\r\nFlorence its home; in the later period it found its fullest expression\r\nin Rome, and even there took its name, the Age of Leo, from another\r\nMedici, Lorenzo's son. It was not to Pope Leo, however, but to his\r\npredecessors, that Rome was indebted for preeminence. At the summons of\r\nthe Papacy men of genius went to Rome from all Italy, but chiefly from\r\nFlorence; and a distinguished Tuscan, almost a Florentine, who went from\r\nFlorence to Rome at the culmination of a brilliant career, fairly serves\r\nas the personification of this intellectual migration. Tommaso\r\nParentucelli, who was born in a little town near Lucca, was educated in\r\nFlorence and Bologna. He took holy orders early, and, going back to\r\nFlorence, quickly became intimate with the clever set of humanists who\r\nsurrounded Cosimo. He was a great student, and won so high a reputation\r\nfor learning that it was to him Cosimo applied for advice, when he\r\nwanted the right books for the library at Fiesole. This collection\r\nbecame famous and was copied both at Rimini and Urbino. Parentucelli was\r\na very capable and attractive man, and embodied in its best form the\r\nessence of Florentine humanistic culture. His character, talents, and\r\naccomplishments were recognized in the Church; he became bishop,\r\ncardinal, and finally Pope, as Nicholas V (1447-55).\r\n\r\nAt Rome Nicholas showed the well-marked characteristics of the\r\nRenaissance. He fostered learning, art, and general culture, not only\r\nbecause of his interest in them, but because he thought that by their\r\nmeans he could overcome that rumbling spirit of reform, which was making\r\ntrouble in Bohemia and Germany, and that by giving the reformers\r\nintellectual interests he could occupy their minds and quell their\r\ndiscontent. He entertained lofty imaginings of a Papacy, resting on\r\nlearning and culture, housed in a nonpareil city, which should be the\r\nacknowledged and admired head of Christendom. He gathered together\r\nscholars of all kinds, collected a library of five thousand volumes, and\r\nfounded the Vatican library. He rebuilt or restored numerous churches\r\nand other buildings in Rome, he began the new Vatican palace, and\r\nplanned a new cathedral in place of the old basilica of St. Peter's, to\r\nbe the greatest church in Christendom. He brought to Rome architects,\r\npainters, goldsmiths, artists, and artisans of all sorts. With him began\r\nthe brilliant period of the Papacy as a secular power devoted to art and\r\nculture, which culminated in what is known as the Age of Leo X.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18]\r\n\r\n Oh, how beautiful is youth\r\n Ever hurrying away,\r\n Come, let him who will be gay,\r\n In to-morrow there's no truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE BARBARIAN INVASIONS (1494-1537)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now leave the great intellectual progress of the Renaissance on\r\nits way from its home in Florence to its culmination in Rome, and look\r\nover the political condition of the principal divisions of Italy. A\r\ncomplete change comes during this period, that can only be likened to\r\nthe change wrought by the invasions of the Barbarians in ancient times.\r\nIn fact, it is a period of fresh invasions by Barbarians, as the\r\nItalians, and not without some justice, still called foreigners. The\r\nyear 1494 was the fatal date of the first invasion of the French. From\r\nthat year onward there was a series of invasions of French, Austrians,\r\nand Spaniards, until Italy was finally parcelled out according to the\r\npleasure of the invaders. Before that time Italy was in a peaceful and\r\nprosperous condition. The famous Florentine historian Guicciardini\r\n(1483-1540) thus records the time of his boyhood: \"Since the fall of the\r\nRoman Empire Italy had never known such great prosperity, nor had\r\nexperienced so desirable a condition as in the year 1490 and the years\r\njust before and after. The country had been brought to profound peace\r\nand tranquillity, agriculture spread over the roughest and most sterile\r\nhills no less than over the most fertile plains, and Italy, subject to\r\nno dominion but her own, abounded in men, merchandise, and wealth. She\r\nwas embellished to the utmost by the magnificence of many princes, by\r\nthe splendour of many most noble and beautiful cities, by the seat and\r\nmajesty of Religion; she was rich in men most apt in public affairs, and\r\nin minds most noble for all sorts of knowledge. She was industrious and\r\nexcellent in every art, and, according to the standard of those days,\r\nnot without military glory.\"\r\n\r\nIn these happy years, and in the decades that preceded them, Italian\r\npolitics was a domestic game between the five principal powers, Papacy,\r\nNaples, Florence, Venice, and Milan, who treated one another's border\r\ncities as stakes. They made leagues and counter-leagues, waged\r\ninnumerable little wars, fought bloodless skirmishes, flourished their\r\nswords, blew their trumpets, and made a good deal of commotion; but they\r\nwere all Italians, they all knew the rules of the game, however\r\nirregular and complicated those rules might appear to an outsider, and\r\nif there were bloody heads, they were all in the family. With 1494 came\r\nthe change. History seemed to turn back a thousand years; the French\r\npoured over the Alps from the northwest, the Imperial soldiers of the\r\nHouse of Hapsburg from the northeast, and the Spaniards from their\r\nprovince of Sicily to the south.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Milan, 1466-1535_\r\n\r\nOur chronicle had better begin with the duchy of Milan. There, on the\r\ndeath of Francesco Sforza (1466), his son, Galeazzo Maria, succeeded to\r\nthe throne. This duke was a typical Italian ruler, brilliant in\r\ndisplay, liberal in giving, harsh in taxing, interested in art and\r\nscholarship, crafty and cruel in politics, and shamelessly dissolute in\r\nprivate life. Fearful stories of his brutality are told. He was\r\nliterally insufferable, and was assassinated (1476). It is interesting\r\nto see the great classical influence, which stimulated the arts and the\r\nhumanities, quickening the spirits of young men and giving an antique\r\nlustre to murder. The story goes that a schoolmaster of Milan, who had\r\ndrilled his boys in Plutarch, till Plutarch's world seemed to live\r\nagain, burst out in his lecture, \"Will none among my pupils rise up like\r\nBrutus and Cassius to free his country from this vile yoke and merit\r\neternal renown?\" Three of his pupils, stimulated by private wrongs to\r\nemulate the classical example, murdered the duke in a church. All three\r\nwere put to death. The last to die was skewered on iron hooks and cut to\r\npieces alive. \"I know,\" he said, \"that for my wrongdoings I have\r\ndeserved these tortures and more besides, could my poor flesh endure\r\nthem; but as for the noble act for which I die, that comforts my soul.\r\nInstead of repenting it, were I to live my life ten times again, ten\r\ntimes again to perish in these tortures, none the less would I\r\nconsecrate all my life's blood, and all my might, to that noble\r\npurpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of the murder were unimportant. In politics, even more than\r\nin the arts, the classic impulse only affected details. Lodovico Sforza,\r\nnicknamed Il Moro, the late duke's brother, seized the government and\r\nsupplanted the lawful heir, his young nephew, in every ducal\r\nprerogative except the title. Lodovico was a brilliant, intellectual\r\nman, devoid of moral sense; and for a time flourished in the full\r\nsunshine of the opening High Renaissance. He patronized Bramante, he\r\nemployed familiarly Leonardo da Vinci. But his political talents were\r\nsuited to the earlier period of domestic Italian politics. Had he lived\r\nthen, his abilities, inherited from both the Sforzas and Visconti, would\r\nhave kept him secure on his ducal throne; but he did not understand the\r\nlarger forces of European politics.\r\n\r\nMilan being at odds with Naples, and the other Italian powers as usual\r\neither taking part, or biding a more favourable time, Lodovico Sforza\r\nthought it would be a brilliant play, in the little Italian game, to use\r\na foreign piece to checkmate Naples. He invited the French king, Charles\r\nVIII, who represented the claims of the House of Anjou to the Neapolitan\r\ncrown, to come into Italy and take possession of his own. Other Italian\r\npoliticians, with no more knowledge of European politics than Lodovico,\r\njoined in the petition. Charles VIII, an ugly little man, of scant\r\nintelligence, strong in a compact and vigorous kingdom, believing that\r\nhe could play the part of a Charlemagne, accepted the suggestion with\r\nalacrity, got together an admirable army, and crossed the Alps, in the\r\nmemorable year 1494. He received the respects of Lodovico and swept\r\ntriumphantly down through Italy. No resistance to speak of was\r\nattempted. Florence made a treaty with him, the Pope was delighted to be\r\nable to do the like, and Naples watched her king run away and the\r\nFrench march in, with blended indifference and pleasure. This brilliant\r\nsuccess, however, was a mere blaze of straw. The powers of Europe took\r\nalarm, and while the puny Charles was rioting in Naples, made a league,\r\nin which Venice, the Pope, and the double-dealing Sforza joined. Charles\r\nhurried north as fast as he could, and barely escaped across the Alps.\r\nBut the episode was full of portent for Italy. The Barbarians had once\r\nagain broken through the barrier which nature had set up to protect\r\nItaly; they had rediscovered what a delightful place Italy was; and the\r\nsecond period of Barbarian invasion had begun. We cannot dally over\r\nMilan. Sforza's treachery overreached itself. The succeeding King of\r\nFrance, Louis XII, a prince of Orleans, was a grandson of Gian Galeazzo\r\nVisconti's eldest daughter, and had as good a legal title to the\r\ninheritance of the Visconti as his second cousin Lodovico; though in\r\nstrictness neither title had any legal value. Revenge lent strength to\r\nLouis's claim. In a few years (1499), the French again descended into\r\nthe pleasant plains of Lombardy, captured Milan, took Sforza prisoner,\r\nand locked him up in a French prison for the rest of his life.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to follow the shifting ownership of Milan, tossed about in\r\nthe great struggle between Francis I of France and the Emperor Charles\r\nV. The Empire espoused the cause of the Sforza heirs and put them back\r\non the throne. Then France gained the battle of Marignano (1515) and\r\nrecovered Milan, but the Empire conquered at Pavia (1525), and finally\r\nwon. The male line of the Sforzas became extinct in 1535; and the\r\ndukedom of Milan, though it continued to be a nominal fief of the\r\nEmpire, was annexed to the Spanish crown by Charles V (who was King of\r\nSpain as well as Emperor), and passed as a part of the Spanish\r\ninheritance to a line of Spanish kings. The Barbarian occupation of\r\nMilan was destined to last for three hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Florence, 1492-1537_\r\n\r\nNow that we have followed Milan into the service of Spanish masters, we\r\nmust do a somewhat similar office for Florence. But Florence's liberty\r\nwas put out in glory. The politic statesman, Lorenzo dei Medici, whose\r\nsagacity had contributed so much to the pleasant state of Italy prior to\r\nthe French invasion, died in 1492. The great period of Florentine\r\nintellectual primacy ended with him, for, though Florence continued to\r\npour forth genius, that genius no longer was gathered together at home\r\nbut emigrated to honour other places. Nevertheless, she again challenges\r\nour admiration; the ancient republican city once more asserted its\r\npreeminence by a burst of moral enthusiasm. Nowhere else in Italy\r\nthroughout the Renaissance was such a spectacle seen, and though the\r\nleader, Girolamo Savonarola (1452-98), was a native of Ferrara, yet it\r\nwas in Florence, and among Florentines, that he kindled enthusiasm and\r\nran his brilliant career. Savonarola was the reincarnation of a Hebrew\r\nprophet, a Florentine Habakkuk, passionately sure of the moral\r\ngovernment of God, passionately convinced that the wickedness of Italy\r\nmust bring its own punishment and purification. Shortly before\r\nLorenzo's death he became a distinguished preacher, spoke in the\r\ncathedral, and won the ear of the people. He preached righteousness and\r\njudgment to come. He proclaimed spiritual evils and political\r\npunishments, and foretold that God would stretch forth His hand and send\r\nHis avenger to punish Italy. The prophecies were so definite, and fitted\r\nthe invasion of Charles VIII so accurately, that Savonarola was hailed\r\nas a prophet. In the excitement over the French invasion Lorenzo's sons\r\nwere driven out, the former republican constitution reestablished, and\r\nSavonarola raised by a burst of popular enthusiasm practically to the\r\nposition of guiding and governing the city. The best way to understand\r\nSavonarola's influence is to read a few extracts from the diary of Luca\r\nLanducci, a Florentine apothecary:--\r\n\r\n\"December 14, 1494. On this day Fra Girolamo greatly laboured in the\r\npulpit that Florence should adopt a good form of government; he has been\r\npreaching in Santa Maria del Fiore [the Duomo] every day, and this day,\r\nSunday, he preached, and he did not want women but men, and he wanted\r\nthe officers of the city, and nobody stayed in the Palace [Palazzo\r\nVecchio, the City Hall] except the Gonfaloniere and one other; all the\r\nofficials in Florence were there, and he preached about matters of\r\nstate, that we ought to love and fear God and love the common weal, and\r\nthat no man henceforth should wish to hold his head high or wish himself\r\ngreat. He always inclined to the people's side, and insisted that no\r\nblood should be shed, but that punishment should be made in some other\r\nway; and he preached like this every day....\r\n\r\n\"April, 1495. Fra Girolamo preached and said that the Virgin Mary had\r\nrevealed to him how the city of Florence would become richer, more\r\nglorious, and more powerful than she had ever been, but not till after\r\nmany troubles; and he spoke all this as if he were a prophet, and most\r\nof the people believed him, especially the better sort who had no\r\npolitical or partisan passions....\r\n\r\n\"June 17, 1495. The Frate nowadays is held in such esteem and devotion\r\nin Florence that there are many men and women who would obey him\r\nimplicitly, if he should say 'walk into the fire.' Many believe him to\r\nbe a prophet, and he said so himself....\r\n\r\n\"February 16 [1496], the Carnival. Fra Girolamo preached a few days ago\r\nthat the children, instead of foolish pranks, throwing stones, etc.,\r\nshould collect alms and distribute them to the worthy poor; and, thanks\r\nto divine grace, such a change was wrought, that in place of tomfoolery\r\nthe children collected alms for days beforehand, [and to-day six\r\nthousand of them or more, carrying olive branches and singing hymns,\r\nmarched to the Duomo where they offered up their alms] so that good\r\nsensible men wept from tenderness and said, 'Truly this new change is\r\nthe work of God.' ... I have written this because it is the fact and I\r\nsaw it, and I felt the greatest happiness to have my children among\r\nthose blessed innocent bands....\r\n\r\n\"August 15, 1496. Fra Girolamo preached in Santa Maria del Fiore [the\r\nDuomo, where great scaffolds had been erected which were filled with\r\nchildren singing], and there was so much holiness in the church, and it\r\nwas so sweet to hear the children sing, above, below, and on every side,\r\nsinging so simply and so modestly, that they did not seem like children.\r\nI write this because I was there and saw it and felt so much spiritual\r\nsweetness. In truth the Church was full of angels.\"\r\n\r\nThe friar's political enemies were strong, and the Pope, the very\r\nnotable Borgia, Alexander VI, in anger and in fear, excommunicated him,\r\nand bade the Signory of Florence forbid him to preach. There was great\r\ndisturbance over this action, and feeling ran to a passionate height.\r\nOne of Savonarola's disciples, a foolish Dominican, challenged an\r\nadversary to the ordeal by fire; the challenge was accepted, and on the\r\nappointed day all Florence, in great excitement, flocked to the\r\n_piazza_. The Dominican and his adversary were there, and their\r\nrespective partisans, but nothing was done. One delay followed another;\r\nthere was nothing but hesitancy, disagreement as to conditions, backing\r\nand filling. The disappointed populace turned on Savonarola. They had\r\nbelieved him a prophet and expected to see a judgment of God. The Pope\r\ntook advantage of this resentment, and demanded his trial. Savonarola\r\nwas tried, and tortured. During the torture a confession was extorted\r\nfrom him, which was undoubtedly pieced out by forgery. Our apothecary\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"April 19, 1498. The confession of Fra Girolamo was read before the\r\nCouncil in the Great Hall, which he had written with his own hand,--he\r\nwhom we held to be a prophet,--and he confessed that he was not a\r\nprophet, and had not received from God the things he preached, and he\r\nconfessed to many things in the course of his preaching which were the\r\nopposite of what he had given us to understand. I was there to hear the\r\nconfession read, and was bewildered and stood astonished and stupefied.\r\nMy soul was in pain to see such an edifice tumble to earth because it\r\nall rested on a lie. I expected Florence to be a new Jerusalem from\r\nwhich should proceed laws, glory, and the example of a good life and to\r\nbehold the restoration of the Church, the conversion of the infidels,\r\nand the comfort of good men, and now I behold the opposite,--and I took\r\nthe medicine. In Thy will, O God, stand all things.\"\r\n\r\nSavonarola was condemned to death for heresy; he was hanged, his body\r\nburned, and his ashes flung into the Arno. So ended the one moral effort\r\nof the Italian Renaissance.\r\n\r\nAfter his death the Republican government endured for a time; but the\r\nMedicean faction was powerful and forced its way back in 1512. Then\r\nLorenzo's second son, Giovanni (1475-1521), following the steps of\r\nFlorentine art and humanism, went to Rome and became Pope Leo X. As\r\nPope, he was able to strengthen his family in Florence and to extend its\r\ndominion. But Republicanism, quickened by the events then happening in\r\nRome, flared up once more in 1527; but it was helpless before the\r\nhostile spirit of the time. Another Medici had become Pope, Clement VII,\r\nand the requirements of policy induced the calculating Emperor, Charles\r\nV, to suppress what he deemed a rebellion. Florence made a gallant\r\ndefence; Michelangelo strengthened her walls, and the courage of the\r\ndefenders threw a dying glory over the city. A great grandson of\r\nLorenzo, Alessandro dei Medici, was put into power, and married to a\r\ndaughter of Charles V. He was succeeded by a distant cousin, Cosimo\r\n(1537), who was honoured by His Holiness the Pope with the title of\r\nGrand Duke of Tuscany. Thus Florentine liberty was extinguished, and the\r\nMedici were established as dukes in name as well as in fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Two Sicilies, 1494-1516_\r\n\r\nIn the south, it will be remembered, Alfonso the Magnanimous, as the\r\ngrateful humanists dubbed him, had united Sicily and the mainland; but\r\non his death (1458) the kingdom fell asunder. Sicily, as a part of the\r\nKingdom of Aragon, devolved on a legitimate brother, whereas Naples,\r\nclaimed as a conquest, was bequeathed to a bastard son, Ferdinand the\r\nCruel. The two kingdoms followed their respective dynasties for nearly\r\nfifty years, when Sicily came by inheritance to Ferdinand of Aragon.\r\nThat crafty and eminently successful monarch, not satisfied with\r\nCastile, Granada, Sicily, and a transatlantic realm, but coveting the\r\nKingdom of Naples, conspired with Louis XII of France, who now\r\nrepresented the traditional Angevin claim; the two invaded the coveted\r\nkingdom, and divided it between them (1500-1). Naturally, the rogues\r\ndisagreed over the division of the spoils, and fell foul of each other.\r\nThe Spaniards were triumphant, and the Kingdom of Naples was annexed to\r\nthe crown of Spain. Thus the Two Sicilies were reunited under the\r\nSpanish crown, and on Ferdinand's death (1516) descended to his\r\ngrandson, the Emperor Charles V. The unfortunate kingdom remained an\r\nappanage of Spain for two hundred years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Venice, 1453-1508_\r\n\r\nIn the northeast Venice still led a brilliant career, like a charming\r\nwoman who has received some fatal hurt and does not know it, but\r\ninstinctively lives more brilliantly than ever. Her fatal hurt was the\r\nconquest of Constantinople by the Turks (1453). At first the only\r\nobvious ill consequence was war. Venice, willy-nilly, stepped into the\r\nplace of Constantinople, and became \"the bulwark of the West.\" She waged\r\nwar after war with the Turks and maintained her reputation for valour\r\nand resolution, but Turkey was too strong for her, and little by little\r\nstripped her of her long-drawn-out empire of coast and island. A far\r\nworse blow than direct war was the cutting of the great trade routes\r\nwith the East, which damaged all the maritime cities of Italy, but\r\nVenice most. Turkey stopped the supplies of Venetian greatness, and\r\nslowly but surely sapped Venetian strength. On the stoppage of the\r\nstraight road to Asia, the blocked current of commerce poked about for a\r\nnew way, and discovered that it could reach the East by doubling the\r\nCape of Good Hope. Commerce thus avoided Turkey, but it also abandoned\r\nthe Mediterranean, great centre and source of ancient civilization, and\r\nleft the maritime cities of Italy stranded, as it were, on the shores\r\nof a forsaken sea.\r\n\r\nThis doom, however, was still hidden in the obscurity of the future, and\r\nVenice appeared to be at the height of prosperity. The French\r\nambassador, Philippe de Commines, called her \"the most triumphant city I\r\nhave ever seen.\" The Venetians were a people apart from other Italians;\r\nthey never suffered from foreign invasion, or domestic revolt; they\r\nlived in isolation, maintained their own customs and usages, and enjoyed\r\na sumptuous, opulent life, in proud security. Venice was the richest,\r\nthe most comfortable, the best governed city in the world. In military\r\nstrength she was commonly reckoned the first power in Italy, with the\r\nPapacy, the Kingdom of Naples, and the Duchy of Milan about equal in\r\nsecond rank. Venice entertained no suspicion of any seeds of decadence,\r\nand continued her greedy career of annexation on the mainland, with a\r\nhaughtiness worthy of ancient Rome. She laid hands on part of Romagna,\r\nand angered the Popes who had a title thereto, which, however imperfect,\r\nwas much better than the Venetian title. She provoked the Emperor\r\nMaximilian, of the House of Hapsburg, who claimed Verona as an Imperial\r\ncity; and to the west she came into dangerous competition with the\r\nFrench invaders. These enemies, taking their cue from the piratical\r\nseizure of Naples by the French and Spanish, agreed together to\r\npartition the Venetian territory on the mainland, and invited all the\r\npowers of Europe to join them and take a share of the booty. The\r\ncoalition planned a kind of joint-stock piracy. This was the League of\r\nCambrai (1508), which stripped Venice of all her Italian territory, and\r\nthreatened the city herself. The allies, however, fell out among\r\nthemselves; and Venice, by biding her opportunity, in the course of time\r\nmanaged to recover most of her lost territory. Thus, though for a season\r\nthe Barbarians brought the haughty city to her knees, she weathered the\r\nstorms better than the rest of Italy, and continued to maintain her\r\nindependence for three centuries to come.\r\n\r\nThe Papacy deserves a chapter to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE PAPAL MONARCHY (1471-1527)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Papacy found itself in an exceedingly difficult situation. It had to\r\nadapt an ecclesiastical system, matured in the Middle Ages, to new\r\npolitical systems, to new knowledge, to new thought, in short, to a new\r\nworld. During its struggle with the Empire, the course before it,\r\nhowever arduous, had been plain, namely, to abase the Emperors; during\r\nits captivity at Avignon, its duty to return to Rome (though individual\r\nPopes were blind or indifferent) likewise had been plain; during the\r\nschism, the one end to be aimed at was union. But now everything was\r\nnew, and a new policy had to be devised. There were three matters which\r\nrequired particular consideration: the demand for reform which came from\r\nacross the Alps; the great intellectual awakening of the Renaissance;\r\nand the ambitions of the other Italian powers. For these problems the\r\nsolution which the Papacy tried was twofold: to establish a firm\r\npontifical principality, and to use the new intellectual forces as a\r\nmotive power to keep itself at the head of Christendom. By a strong\r\npontifical principality the Papacy hoped to secure itself against the\r\ncovetousness of the other Italian states. By using the new intellectual\r\nforces it hoped to range them on its side, and so to choke, or at least\r\nto overcrow, the ultramontane cry for reform. One need not suppose that\r\nsuch a plan was consciously thought out in detail from the beginning;\r\nrather it was the course which the Papacy gradually took, partly from\r\ntheory, partly under the stress of passing circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe remember that the Council of Constance closed the Great Schism, and\r\nsent Martin V (1417-31) back to Rome as sole Pope. His pontificate marks\r\nthe end of the old Republican commune, which had made so much trouble\r\nfor Popes and Emperors in days past, and therefore marks the first\r\ndefinite stage in the transformation of the Papacy into a local secular\r\npower. Rome, although she did not deny herself an occasional outbreak in\r\nmemory, as it were, of good old days, settled down into a papal city.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part of the papal story is the process that went on\r\nwithin the Church. The intolerable burden of ecclesiastical taxation,\r\nthe growth of heresy, and the degeneration of the clergy, as well as the\r\nGreat Schism, had roused Europe to a sense that something must be done,\r\nand Europe attempted the old remedy of Ecumenical Councils. At Constance\r\nthe question of general reform had come up, but the papal party had\r\nmanaged to prevent action. At the next Council, held at Basel, internal\r\ndifficulties appeared still more plainly. Party lines were sharply\r\ndrawn; the ultramontanes, as before, wished to subject the Popes to the\r\nsupremacy of Councils, to substitute an ecclesiastical aristocracy of\r\nbishops in place of a papal monarchy, and, as it were, transfer the\r\ncentre of ecclesiastical gravity from Rome across the Alps. Feeling ran\r\nso high that the Council split in two. Part followed the Pope to Italy,\r\nand part stayed in Basel and elected an anti-pope (1439). It looked as\r\nif schism had come again, but the danger passed. The anti-pope resigned;\r\nunity was restored and lasted for seventy years.\r\n\r\nNicholas V, as we have seen, hoped to maintain the Papacy at the head of\r\nChristendom by means of the new intellectual forces. Such a conception\r\nwas purely Italian, and showed plainly enough that the Papacy had ceased\r\nto represent Christendom, had ceased to be the real head of a Universal\r\nChurch, and had become a purely Italian institution. While Nicholas and\r\nhis successors were thinking of culture and of becoming Italian princes,\r\nthe pious ultramontanes, comparatively indifferent to the intellectual\r\nexcitement of the Renaissance, were thinking of sin and of the remedy\r\nfor sin. The papal Curia was clever, but did not foresee that to\r\nsubordinate the old conception of the Papacy as the head of the\r\nreligious and ecclesiastical organization of Europe to the new\r\nconception of it as an Italian principality would surely alienate the\r\nTeutonic peoples; it did not foresee that the Renaissance, with its\r\nspirit of examination, investigation, criticism, with its encouragement\r\nof the free play of the human mind, was necessarily preparing the way\r\nfor the Reformation. But the Curia perceived the opposite difficulties,\r\nto which we are generally blind, that unless the Papacy did establish\r\nitself as a temporal power, it might well be reduced to another\r\nBabylonish Captivity by a king of Naples, a duke of Milan, or even by\r\nsome _condottiere_. And it perceived that other difficulty as well,\r\nthat if the Papacy turned against the intellectual movement, the\r\nintellectual movement would, in self-defence, turn against the Papacy.\r\n\r\nThe Popes did indeed seek to revive the old role of the Papacy in one\r\nrespect. They tried to arouse the sentiment of Christendom against the\r\ninvading Turks, and to lead a crusade themselves. But the time for such\r\na course had passed. The kings and princes of Europe were busy with\r\ntheir own kingdoms and principalities and would not budge; and the\r\nPapacy was obliged to give up the plan. Discouraged by this failure it\r\nnaturally turned to the new theory of a little papal kingdom and\r\nvigorously put the theory into practice. The three Popes who\r\naccomplished this task were Francesco della Rovere, Sixtus IV (1471-84),\r\nRodrigo Borgia, Alexander VI (1493-1503), and Giuliano della Rovere,\r\nJulius II (1503-13). Their careers must be looked at more closely.\r\n\r\nSixtus IV was the son of a peasant. Educated by the Franciscans, he\r\nbecame distinguished as a scholar in theology, philosophy, and\r\necclesiastical affairs, and was chosen general of the order. When Pope,\r\nafter a last futile attempt to start a crusade, Sixtus openly abandoned\r\nthe role of Pontiff of Christendom and became an Italian prince.\r\nEnergetic and masterful, he set to work to consolidate the loose and\r\ninsubordinate papal territories into a compact state. The task was not\r\neasy, and one of the obstacles in his way was lack of men whom he could\r\ntrust. It was of little advantage to gather together an army, or to\r\ncapture a city, if the papal general or governor found his own\r\ninterests opposed to papal interests. Loyalty was held in scant esteem\r\nby Italians of the Renaissance. Sixtus met the difficulty by employing\r\nhis nephews. This policy was by no means the beginning of papal\r\nnepotism, but these nephews happened to be young men with marked tastes\r\nfor greed, ferocity, and dissipation, and brought the system into\r\nespecial notoriety. To one nephew the Pope gave a cardinal's hat, four\r\nbishoprics, an abbey, a patriarchate, as well as free access to the\r\npapal treasury. When this young man had died of dissipation, the post of\r\nchief favourite descended to his brother. For him the Pope procured a\r\nwife from the ducal house of Sforza, and began to carve a dukedom in\r\nRomagna, with the intention of adding slices cut from the neighbouring\r\nstates. This young man was arrogant, ignorant, and brutal, with no\r\ninterests except ambition and the chase. In due course he was murdered.\r\nWhatever effect nepotism of this character produced across the Alps, it\r\nserved certain purposes in Italy. Sixtus made himself feared, and\r\nadvanced the project of a papal kingdom to a point where his successors\r\nwere able to take it up and complete it.\r\n\r\nSixtus also pursued Nicholas's plan of making Rome the first city of the\r\nworld in art and magnificence. He brought together architects and\r\nartists, and patronized art and literature. But this aspect of the plan\r\nto maintain the Papacy at the head of Christian Europe belongs rather to\r\nthe story of the high Renaissance, and must be postponed to the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nWe may pass over the next Pope, who was not distinguished except for a\r\nfrank recognition of his illegitimate children, and for what then\r\nappeared a whimsical desire to maintain peace, and proceed to the\r\nnotorious Rodrigo Borgia, Alexander VI. It was in Borgia's pontificate\r\nthat the French invasion of 1494 took place. This introduction of a new\r\nand terrible element into Italian politics frightened him as well as\r\nother Italian rulers, for he knew that the Papal State would never be\r\nstrong enough to resist single-handed such an army as that of Charles\r\nVIII, and he tried to form a union of the Italian powers for common\r\ndefence. His policy met little success, especially as he himself, seeing\r\nadvantages to be gained from a French alliance, whirled about, granted\r\nto the French king a dispensation for divorce, to the French favourite a\r\ncardinal's hat, and made a separate treaty for himself (1499). Borgia\r\ndid no more than any other Italian prince would have done, but he must\r\nbear his share of the responsibility. It was a deliberate sacrifice of\r\nItalian for papal interests. Whether that was justifiable or not is\r\nanother matter. The Pope wished to establish a Pontifical State, and\r\nacted in the manner which he thought would be most likely to achieve\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBorgia also followed the example set by Sixtus, and raised his family to\r\npower and rank, partly, of course, from affection, but partly in order\r\nto strengthen the Papacy. His task was to reduce the papal vassals in\r\nthe Pontifical States to obedience and so to create a strong central\r\ngovernment. The instrument he employed was his son Caesar Borgia. This\r\nbrilliant young man has won a great reputation, owing in large measure\r\nto Machiavelli's admiration. He was an athletic, handsome, taciturn man,\r\nquick, cunning, and cruel. He began his career in the Church, but at the\r\ntime of his father's reconciliation with France, gave up his cardinal's\r\nhat, and was created duke by the French king. Caesar made an excellent\r\ninstrument for rooting out the disobedient vassals of the Papal State.\r\nThey were crafty, greedy, and false; he was craftier, greedier, and\r\nfalser than they. He dispossessed them with ruthless vigour, and\r\nestablished himself in their stead. His energy and success were\r\nextraordinary, and frightened other Italian rulers. None knew how far\r\nhis ambition might stretch, or how far the Papacy might be able to push\r\nhim. The direct military power of the Pontifical State was not very\r\ngreat and could readily be measured, but the indirect power of the\r\nPapacy as head of the Christian Church was vague and alarming.\r\nNevertheless, Caesar's principality, which rested wholly on the Papacy,\r\nfell to pieces when his father died.\r\n\r\nBorgia's attitude towards the arts belongs to the next chapter; but in\r\nrespect to them as well as to the Pontifical State, he followed what I\r\nhave called the twofold policy of the Popes of the Renaissance. That\r\npolicy undoubtedly had its advantages; but it also had its\r\ndisadvantages, and these appear more conspicuous in Borgia's pontificate\r\nthan in any other. The establishment of papal dominion, as we have seen,\r\nencouraged, if it did not necessitate, nepotism; and nepotism involved\r\nprodigality and dissipation. The Popes used their families to\r\nstrengthen their position; and the upstart families, giddy with sudden\r\nwealth and power, misbehaved. The nephews of Sixtus rendered some\r\nservice to the Papacy, but they caused scandal. Caesar Borgia rendered\r\ngreater services, and caused still greater scandal. The other branch of\r\nthe twofold policy, by a different path, led to the same result.\r\nPatronage of arts and letters involved great expense and encouraged\r\nluxurious tastes; luxury led to idleness, and idleness to vice. The\r\nRoman atmosphere had never been favourable to spiritual life, and now,\r\nsurcharged with the classical spirit of the Renaissance, practically\r\nextinguished religion.\r\n\r\nFor centuries the Roman Curia had been a butt for the arrows of satire.\r\nThe minnesingers of Germany, the troubadours of Provence, had paused in\r\ntheir amorous ditties to compose bitter gibes against the greed and\r\nluxurious life of the great Roman prelates. Taunts such as this became\r\nhousehold phrases: Curia Romana non quaerit ovem sine lana.[19] Dante\r\nhad put priest, prelate, and Pope into hell. Petrarch had written\r\nscathing verses:--\r\n\r\n    Nest of treachery, wherein is hatched\r\n    All evil that besets the world to-day,\r\n    Slaves to wine, debauch, and gluttony,\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Well-head of woe, and baiting place of wrath,\r\n    School of false thought, temple of heresy, etc.\r\n\r\nOne of the best tales in the \"Decameron\" turns on the conversion of a\r\nJew, who goes to Rome, sees the conduct of Pope and cardinals, and\r\nbecomes convinced that only a Divine Church can support so staggering a\r\nburden. In Borgia's time the Curia outdid itself, and Borgia led the\r\nway. He acknowledged his children, and lavished papal revenues upon\r\nthem; he bestowed a cardinal's hat on Alexander Farnese, founder of the\r\nFarnese family, for the sake of Giulia Farnese, his frail sister; he\r\nsanctioned ballets and theatricals of a scandalous nature in the Vatican\r\npalace, and encouraged his sons and his cardinals in a dissolute life.\r\nVice was not all; the odour of crime infected the air. The Pope's son,\r\nthe Duke of Gandia, was murdered, so was his son-in-law, husband of his\r\ndaughter Lucrezia. Cardinals died mysteriously. The common voice,\r\nwhispering low in Rome and loud elsewhere, ascribed these murders to\r\nCaesar Borgia. It appeared as if the Pope believed the charges himself.\r\n\"Caesar,\" he said, \"is a good-natured man, but he cannot tolerate\r\naffronts.\" Lucrezia, too, became the object of the grossest slanders. No\r\ndoubt common gossip then, as always, raised a tree of falsehood from a\r\nmustard grain of truth; but credulity accepted every accusation as true.\r\nNorth of the Alps the simple-minded Germans shuddered and crossed\r\nthemselves. Even the Romans were shocked. When the Pope died, no man\r\nwould touch his body; it was dragged by a rope fastened to its foot from\r\nthe bed to the grave, and there tumbled in. No one doubted that his soul\r\nhad gone to hell.\r\n\r\nAlexander VI violated every rule of domestic morality; nevertheless,\r\nPope Julius II (1503-13) violated the sacred character of priest as\r\nfundamentally, though in a much less repulsive way. Julius, a nephew of\r\nSixtus IV, was a fiery soldier, a high-aspiring prince, a man of great\r\nqualities, impatient and magnificent. Had he been duke of Milan or King\r\nof Naples, he would have presented a noble figure; but a Pope armed\r\ncap-a-pie, entering a conquered city through the breach battered by his\r\ncannon, was as clear a defiance of the evangelical spirit of the\r\nreformers as the private profligacy of Pope Borgia.\r\n\r\nJulius pursued the twofold policy of the Papacy with greater zeal and\r\ngreater success than any of his predecessors. His furious energy\r\ncompleted the work of making the incohesive states of the Church into a\r\ncompact principality; and he is the real founder of the absolute Papal\r\nState, the first real Pope-king. He achieved equal success in the other\r\nbranch of the policy, and revelled in the kindred spirit of the High\r\nRenaissance. Julius exalted Rome to the place of first city in the\r\nworld; and if the world had asked for art from the Papacy instead of\r\nasking for religion, it would have been abundantly satisfied. But\r\nGermany was thinking of sin, of vice, of simony, of taxation, and was\r\nbecoming conscious of an extreme national antipathy to Italian rule; and\r\nwhen a young German monk, like Martin Luther, went to Rome, instead of\r\ntaking pleasure in the architecture, painting, and sculpture that\r\nadorned the city, he was horrified at the lack of religion.\r\n\r\nJulius, however, was entitled to a sense of accomplishment at his death.\r\nHe left to his successors a little kingdom in the middle of Italy, and\r\nhe had made Rome the centre of the arts. Not till the days of his\r\nsuccessors did the failure of that policy appear. By a kind of poetic\r\njustice the utter failure of art to satisfy the demand for reform, for\r\npurity, for religion, was proved during the pontificates of the two\r\nMedici, Leo X and Clement VII. The Medici had patronized the arts, both\r\nin Florence and in Rome, and the arts repaid the Medici with enjoyment\r\nand renown. But the Medici had done nothing for the spirit of reform; on\r\nthe contrary, they had helped crush Savonarola, and the spirit of reform\r\nturned upon them. Germany hoisted the standard of secession during the\r\npontificate of Leo, and an army of the unfaithful sacked Rome during\r\nthat of Clement.\r\n\r\nLeo X was a fat, clever, cultivated man, with no great virtues and no\r\nreal vices. \"Let us enjoy the Papacy since God has given it to us,\" is\r\nthe sentiment put into his mouth, and serves to characterize his reign.\r\nBred in his father's intellectual circle, and a member of the luxurious\r\nRoman society, Leo shared the tastes of both. He was a connoisseur of\r\nworks of art, and derived genuine aesthetic pleasure from them; he was\r\nalso fond of agreeable company, good cookery, the chase, and most forms\r\nof social amusement. His political conduct was not of much real\r\nconsequence, as matters had gone too far. In the interminable struggle\r\nbetween Charles V and Francis I, the Papacy tried to hold a balance of\r\npower, and bargained with both sides; but, as the Spaniards, in\r\npossession of both Milan and Naples, were the stronger, the Papacy\r\ngenerally found its advantage on that side. As to the larger matter of\r\nthe ecclesiastical unity of Christendom there was practically nothing\r\nto be done. The causes which split the Teutonic world from the Latin\r\nwere already matured. It was too late to stop the Reformation. Luther\r\nmight have been dealt with more shrewdly, but the forces behind him\r\ncould not have been kept in check. Leo excommunicated Luther (1520), and\r\nthe Imperial Diet at Worms condemned him and his doctrine, but the unity\r\nof the Church was doomed.\r\n\r\nTo Leo succeeded his cousin Clement VII, after a brief pontificate by\r\nthe last foreign Pope. Clement was incompetent, and failed to realize\r\nthe gravity of his situation; neither he nor Rome understood the crisis\r\nthey had reached. The prevailing state of mind may be inferred from this\r\nextract from the diary of a young Roman burgher: \"I saw this Pope the\r\nfirst day of May, 1525, come in the morning of the Feast of SS. Philip\r\nand James to the Church of the Holy Apostles, and after celebrating high\r\nmass, remain all day and night in the palace of the Colonna.... That day\r\nit was an old and foolish custom in the Colonna palace (which connects\r\nwith the church and has windows looking in it), to throw various kinds\r\nof fowls and animals into the church to the people who were there, all\r\nof the lowest sort. They also put a pig in the middle of the church up\r\nhigh, and whoever was able to climb up and take it, won it; and on top\r\nof the roof were kegs and pots of water, which they poured on the\r\npersons who climbed up. The amusement of those gentlemen, and of the\r\nrest who looked on, was to see the crowd in a mess, battling,\r\nshrieking, pushing, shoving, like beasts,--a merrymaking not becoming in\r\na church or any sacred edifice.\" The diary adds: \"Now let people learn\r\nto know the souls of the great and especially of priests, how wicked,\r\ndeceitful, and false they are, how full of fraud and knavery.\"[20] There\r\nwere plenty of other facts to prove this conclusion. The merrymaking was\r\ndoomed to cease.\r\n\r\nThe incompetent Pope was totally at a loss what policy to follow, not\r\nknowing whether it was better to incline towards the Empire or to\r\nFrance. He shifted at the wrong time, joined a league against the\r\nEmpire, then wriggled and shuffled, and so drew upon himself and the\r\ndevoted city the punishment due to a long course of wickedness. The\r\nImperial army, a ruffian host of Germans (many of them Lutherans),\r\nSpaniards, and Italians, under the command of the traitor Bourbon, was\r\nencamped in the north; the unpaid soldiers clamoured for plunder, and\r\nBourbon led them to Rome, carried the neglected walls by assault, and\r\nput the city to sack. Rome was a little city, with perhaps 90,000\r\ninhabitants, but rich in the oblations and tribute money of Christendom;\r\nthe churches were decked with gold and silver, the palaces stuffed with\r\nprecious paintings, tapestries, and ornaments of every kind. Popes,\r\ncardinals, and princes had rivalled one another in accumulations of\r\nworks of art and articles of luxury. Though license, profligacy, and\r\ncrime had then shut out Rome from the sympathy of the world, it is\r\nimpossible to read to-day of the horrors of the sack--men murdered,\r\nmothers, daughters, nuns outraged, old men and priests brutally\r\ninsulted, churches and sacred relics defiled--without the sharpest pity.\r\nFor eight days the devilish work went on, and but 30,000 inhabitants\r\nwere left, so many had fled, or been killed, or made prisoners (1527).\r\n\r\nTerrible was the punishment that Clement witnessed,--Rome sacked, the\r\nliberty of Italy taken away, the Roman Catholic Church rent in two.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] The Roman Curia is not looking for a sheep without wool.\r\n\r\n[20] _The Papacy during the Reformation_, vol. v, Appendix (translated).\r\nM. Creighton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE HIGH RENAISSANCE (1499-1521)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now at liberty to return to the great intellectual and artistic\r\nmovement that lifted Italy to the primacy in Europe, and reached its\r\nzenith in the period of time to which the last two chapters have been\r\ndevoted. This is the culminating period, in which the greatest masters\r\ndid their work, and separates the earlier and more experimental stage\r\nthat preceded it from the later stage of exaggeration and decadence\r\nwhich followed. The movement swept all the arts along with it. It\r\nproduced the greatest men in literature since Petrarch, the greatest\r\narchitects since the Gothic masters of the Ile de France, the greatest\r\nsculptors since Praxiteles, the greatest painters that ever were.\r\n\r\nItalian literature cannot compare with English literature or French in\r\ncompass, variety, richness, or delicacy. Indeed, except for Dante, it\r\nwould have rather a thin and tinkling sound. Nevertheless, in the High\r\nRenaissance it roused itself brilliantly. Niccolo Machiavelli was the\r\nablest writer on the policy of government between Aristotle and Burke.\r\nGuicciardini was the first modern historian. Count Baldassare\r\nCastiglione's \"Book of the Courtier\" is as singularly excellent in its\r\nway as Boswell's \"Life of Johnson.\" Of this book, which portrays\r\nfashionable society at the elegant court of Urbino, Tasso says: \"So\r\nlong as there shall be princes and courts, so long as ladies and\r\ngentlemen shall meet in society, so long as virtue and courtesy shall\r\nabide in our hearts, the name of Castiglione will be held in honour.\"\r\nThe book purports to be a series of conversations between the duchess\r\nand her guests concerning the proper qualities of a perfect gentleman.\r\nThis society, no doubt, is a little affected, stilted, and conceited,\r\nbut it is dignified, well-behaved, and high-minded. These people discuss\r\ndeportment, athletics, propriety of speech, whether one must keep within\r\nthe Tuscan vocabulary of Petrarch and Boccaccio or may make use of the\r\nvernacular spoken elsewhere, whether painting or sculpture is the nobler\r\nart, what a gentleman's dress should be, and so on. The discussion\r\nproceeds to the proper behaviour of a lady, and by natural steps to\r\nlove. Bembo, a famous litterateur, here takes the floor, plunges into\r\nPlatonic ideas, and argues that the higher love, governed by reason, is\r\nbetter than lower love, and will lead to contemplation of universal\r\nbeauty; but that even this stage of love is imperfect, and the lover\r\nmust mount higher still, until his soul, purified by philosophy and\r\nspiritual life, sees the light of angelic beauty and, ravished by the\r\nsplendour of that light, becomes intoxicated and beside itself from\r\npassion to lose itself in the light. \"Let us, then, direct all the\r\nthoughts and forces of our soul to this most sacred light, which shows\r\nus the way that leads to heaven; and following after it, let us lay\r\naside the passions wherewith we were clothed at our fall, and by the\r\nstairway that bears the shadow of sensual beauty on its lowest step,\r\nlet us mount to the lofty mansion where dwells the heavenly, lovely, and\r\ntrue beauty, which lies hidden in the inmost secret recesses of God, so\r\nthat profane eyes cannot behold it,\"[21] etc. This may savour somewhat\r\ntoo much of Platonic rhetoric, but such feelings were genuine,\r\nemotionally genuine, even if they proved evanescent in practice; they\r\nwere familiar to Lorenzo dei Medici and his friends, and to the nobler\r\nspirits throughout Italy, and are as characteristic of the period as its\r\ncruelty, treachery, or sensuality. The effect of such cultivated circles\r\nupon art must have been great; they gave artists encouragement,\r\nsympathy, employment, and by the union of fashion and intelligence\r\nhelped educate the taste of a larger public. It must be remembered that\r\nboth Bramante and Raphael came from Urbino.\r\n\r\nPoetry, with the delightful spontaneity and capriciousness of Italian\r\ngenius, chose Ferrara, the home of the House of Este, to hang its\r\nlaurels in. There Matteo Boiardo wrote the \"Orlando Innamorato\" (Roland\r\nin Love). This poem is an epic of chivalry concerning Charlemagne's\r\ncourt, and deals seriously, and yet at times ironically, with the\r\nsubject of Roland's love for the beautiful Angelica. It was left\r\nunfinished, and Lodovico Ariosto (1474-1533) picked up the thread and\r\ncarried it on, far more brilliantly and far more ironically, under the\r\ntitle \"Orlando Furioso\" (Roland Crazed). Ariosto's poem, which was\r\nimmensely popular, was intended to entertain, and it succeeded; its\r\nvariety, wit, irony, sarcasm, and levity make it entertaining even now.\r\nInferior in moral and sensuous beauty to Spenser's \"Faerie Queene,\" it\r\nis far easier to read. Its interest for us lies in the light it sheds on\r\nthe intellectual state of educated Italians of the Renaissance,\r\nespecially in regard to religion. Biblical allusions, sacred north of\r\nthe Alps, are lugged in to give a touch of humour, as, for instance,\r\nwhere one of the knights, Astolfo, goes on a search for Roland's lost\r\nwits and meets St. John the Evangelist, who drives him to the moon in\r\nElijah's chariot; or where, in another passage, St. Michael finds that\r\nthe goddess of Discord has not obeyed his commands, \"the angel seized\r\nher by the hair, kicked and pounded her incessantly, broke a cross over\r\nher head, till Discord embraced the knees of the divine envoy and howled\r\nfor mercy.\" Ariosto, himself, conformed to the rites of the Church. Like\r\nmost educated Italians he accepted them as conventional forms, tinged\r\npossibly with supernatural power, and kept ecclesiastical ideas wholly\r\nseparate from moral ideas. His sceptical, ironical, Epicurean attitude\r\ntowards non-material things is characteristic of the decadence of this\r\nperiod in which mental activity had outgrown morality.\r\n\r\nAriosto was a gentleman of birth and position. He spent most of his life\r\nin the service of his princes, the House of Este. In later life he\r\nwithdrew from their employment, and lived in his own house, _parva sed\r\napta_ (small but suitable), to which the literary pious still make\r\npilgrimages. He wrote the \"Orlando Furioso\" between 1505 and 1515, and\r\nthereafter devoted most of his leisure to improving and polishing it.\r\nBasking in the sunshine of fashionable admiration, he little suspected\r\nthat another man, who had spent his life in mighty feats of\r\narchitecture, painting, and sculpture, would in his old age write\r\nsonnets that should be read and reread like a breviary by serious men\r\nand women who passed his own luxurious rhetoric unheeded. Michelangelo's\r\nsonnets (some of which were written to Vittoria Colonna) are the noblest\r\nembodiment of those high ideas of love which came down from Plato to the\r\nphilosophers of the Palazzo Medici in Florence and the courtiers at the\r\nducal palace in Urbino. They are crammed to bursting with passionate\r\nintensity, and in that respect have no equals, even in English.\r\n\r\nIn the fine arts the High Renaissance has a score of famous men. Among\r\nthem three or four stand head and shoulders above their fellows. Each is\r\nmarked by extraordinary individuality of talents, character, and\r\ndisposition: Michelangelo by passionate fury--_terribilita_; Raphael by\r\nsweet serenity; Bramante by his even commingling of poise and ardour;\r\nLeonardo by his noble curiosity.\r\n\r\nOf Leonardo, Vasari says: \"Sometimes according to the course of nature,\r\nsometimes beyond and above it, the greatest gifts rain down from\r\nheavenly influences upon the bodies of men, and crowd into one\r\nindividual beauty, grace, and excellence in such superabundance that to\r\nwhatever that man shall turn, his very act is so divine, that,\r\nsurpassing the work of all other men, it makes manifest that it is by\r\nthe special gift of God, and not by human art. This was true of\r\nLeonardo da Vinci; who, beside a physical beauty beyond all praise, put\r\nan infinite grace into whatever he did, and such was his excellence,\r\nthat to whatever difficult things his mind turned he easily solved\r\nthem.\" Leonardo (1452-1519) was a Florentine. He was trained by the\r\nsubtle Verrocchio, from whom he learned the smile, if it be a smile, on\r\nthe faces of his portraits of women. After leaving Verrocchio's workshop\r\nhe went to Lombardy, where he spent sixteen years at the court of Milan.\r\nThere he did a hundred different things: he modelled a great equestrian\r\nstatue of Francesco Sforza (since destroyed), painted portraits, drew\r\narchitectural designs,--for a cupola, a staircase, a bathroom, a\r\ntriumphal arch, etc.,--executed hydraulic works, studied the cultivation\r\nof the grape, and played on his silver lyre. In the refectory of a\r\nDominican monastery he painted his fresco of The Last Supper. One of the\r\nnovices, who watched this handsome young painter at work, says that\r\nsometimes he would dash up the scaffold, brush in hand, put a few\r\ntouches and hurry down; sometimes he would paint from sunrise to sunset\r\nwithout stopping even to eat; sometimes he would stand for hours\r\ncontemplating the different figures. After Sforza's fall, Leonardo left\r\nMilan, and for a time took service with Caesar Borgia as military\r\nengineer and architect. He subsequently returned to Florence, and\r\nfinally went to France, where he died.\r\n\r\nLittle remains of all that Leonardo planned. A half-destroyed fresco, a\r\nfew easel pictures, some incomparable drawings, some treatises on his\r\narts, some apothegms, are enough, however, to justify his fame. One of\r\nhis apothegms, _Tu, o Iddio, tutto ci vendi a prezzo di fatica_ (Thou, O\r\nGod, sellest us everything at the price of hard work), is but poorly\r\nborne out by his own prodigal portion of genius, which rather supports\r\nVasari's view that God makes special gifts. Very rarely has any man\r\nreceived the native endowment of Leonardo da Vinci.\r\n\r\nThe greatest architect of the High Renaissance was Bramante of Urbino.\r\nHe, like Leonardo, worked in Milan during the resplendent reign of\r\nLodovico Sforza. There he did much charming work and imposed his\r\npersonality on Lombard architecture; but his great reputation was made\r\nin Rome, whither he went, drawn by the great Romeward flow of art, when\r\nthe French invasion drove the fine arts from Milan. In Rome, Bramante\r\nbecame the papal architect. He shares with Raphael and Michelangelo the\r\nhonour of making St. Peter's basilica and the Vatican palace what they\r\nare. He also built a little building, whose historical importance is\r\nludicrously out of proportion to its size, it being as little as St.\r\nPeter's is big. It is a tiny circular temple in the court of a church on\r\nthe Janiculum hill across the Tiber. On the ground floor a Doric\r\ncolonnade encircles the temple, on the second story a balustrade. A\r\ndome, capped by a lantern, covers the whole. It is the first building\r\nwhich fully reproduced the style and spirit of antiquity. It set the\r\nfashion for the architecture of the sixteenth century, and determined,\r\namong other indirect and not altogether happy results, the plan of St.\r\nPaul's Cathedral in London and the Capitol in Washington.\r\n\r\nIt was not chance which took Bramante, Raphael, and Michelangelo to\r\nRome. They went because the papal court, pursuing its policy of\r\nmaintaining the Papacy at the head of Christendom by means of culture,\r\nsummoned them to come. Rome never produced great artists. She never was\r\nartistic, any more than she had been spiritual. But just as in earlier\r\ntimes she had drawn spiritual forces to herself and used them, so now\r\nshe attracted to herself and used the artistic forces of Italy. She had\r\nbeen making ready for years; step by step as she had become more\r\nsecular, she had also become more artistic, more intellectual. For\r\nseventy years every Pope contributed to this end. Eugenius IV employed\r\ndistinguished humanists as his secretaries, and invited the most notable\r\npainters and sculptors to Rome. Nicholas V conceived the splendid scheme\r\nof making Rome the mistress of the world's culture. Pius II, AEneas\r\nSylvius Piccolomini, was the most eminent man of letters of his age.\r\nPaul II was a virtuoso in objects of art and increased the grandeur of\r\nthe papal court. Sixtus IV improved the city, built the Sistine Chapel,\r\nand employed Botticelli, Perugino, Signorelli, Ghirlandaio, and Rosselli\r\nto decorate it. Innocent VIII brought Mantegna from Padua and\r\nPinturicchio from Perugia to embellish the Vatican palace. Pope Borgia\r\nmade Pinturicchio his court painter; and that charming master decorated\r\nthe papal apartments in the Vatican with the great bull of the Borgia\r\ncrest, and with portraits of the Pope's children and (so Vasari says) of\r\nthe lovely Giulia Farnese as the Virgin with the Pope worshipping her.\r\n\r\nPopes and cardinals felt the great movement and many strove to lead it,\r\nbut the master figure of the Renaissance at Rome was the fiery Julius\r\nII, whose plans in the arts were even more grandiose than in politics.\r\nHe was the centre of this period, as Cosimo and Lorenzo had been in\r\ntheir generations. Less astute than Cosimo, far less subtle and\r\naccomplished than Lorenzo, he was a much more heroic leader than either.\r\nHis hardy, weather-beaten face in Raphael's portrait, with its strong,\r\nwell-shaped features, shows his imperious, arrogant, irascible, and yet\r\nnoble, nature. This Pontiff brought to Rome the greatest genius of the\r\nRenaissance, Michelangelo, bade him build for him a monumental tomb,\r\nmore splendid than any tomb ever built, twelve yards high and\r\nproportionately wide and deep, and decked with two or three score\r\nstatues. Such a gigantic monument could not have found room in the old\r\nbasilica of St. Peter's, and therefore, as St. Peter's was the proper\r\nplace for it, it became necessary to proceed with the larger plans of\r\nNicholas V. Piecing and patching did not suit Julius. He discussed plans\r\nwith his architects Bramante and Giuliano da San Gallo, and then\r\nresolved to pull down the old basilica, founded by Constantine and\r\nSilvester, despite its thousand years of sacred associations, and build\r\na new church in its place. Bramante's fiery enthusiasm for great designs\r\nmatched the Pope's. Satire suggested that in heaven he would say to St.\r\nPeter, \"I'll pull down this Paradise of yours and build another, a much\r\nfiner and pleasanter place for the blessed saints to live in.\" He\r\ndesigned the new church in the form of a Greek cross with a cupola,\r\nproposing, as it were, to lift the dome of the Pantheon on the basilica\r\nof Constantine, an enormous ruin in the Roman Forum. This gigantic plan\r\nbefitted the new papal scheme of making Rome the head of Europe and the\r\nPapacy the head of culture. The corner-stone was laid on April 18, 1506,\r\nand the old building was demolished piecemeal, the choir first, the nave\r\nlast; and in its place, as demolition proceeded bit by bit, the\r\ncathedral now standing rose, slowly lifting its great bulk in the air,\r\nand finally reached completion and consecration in 1626. The greatest\r\narchitects of Italy succeeded one another as masters of the works,\r\nBramante, Giuliano da San Gallo from Florence, Fra Giocondo from Verona,\r\nRaphael, Antonio da San Gallo the younger, Baldassare Peruzzi from\r\nSiena, and Michelangelo, who, when an old man, took charge and designed\r\nthe dome.\r\n\r\nThe Vatican was altered according to Bramante's plans in order to make\r\nit a fit abode for the head of cultured Christendom: Michelangelo\r\npainted his frescoes on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (1508-12); and\r\nRaphael began to paint the _stanza della segnatura_. Raphael, the most\r\ncharming figure in the world of art, was equally charming in life.\r\nVasari says: \"Among his exceptional gifts I take notice of one of such\r\nrare excellence that I marvel within myself. Heaven gave him power in\r\nour art to produce an effect most contrary to the humours of us\r\npainters, and it is this: the artists and artisans (I do not refer only\r\nto those of meaner sort, but to those who are ambitious to be\r\ngreat--and art produces many of this complexion) who worked in his\r\natelier were so united and had such mutual good-will, that all jealousy\r\nand crossness were extinguished on seeing him, and every mean and\r\nspiteful thought vanished from their minds. Such unity was never seen\r\nbefore. And this was because they were overcome both by his courtesy and\r\nhis art, but more by the genius of his good nature, which was so full of\r\nkindness and overflowing with charity, that not only men, but even the\r\nbeasts almost worshipped him.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time, too, classic art, owing to the discovery of antique\r\nstatues, had its fullest effect. The Nile, now in the Vatican, had been\r\nfound in a Roman garden, the Apollo Belvedere in a vineyard near the\r\ncity, and the Laocoon and many others here and there. Of the discovery\r\nof the Laocoon a record remains. \"I was at the time a boy in Rome,\"\r\nwrote Francesco, son of Giuliano da San Gallo, the architect, \"when one\r\nday it was announced to the Pope that some excellent statues had been\r\ndug up out of the ground in a grape-patch near the church of Santa Maria\r\nMaggiore. The Pope immediately sent a groom to Giuliano da San Gallo to\r\ntell him to go directly and see what it was. Michelangelo Buonarroti was\r\noften at our house, and at the moment chanced to be there; accordingly\r\nmy father invited him to accompany us. I rode behind my father on his\r\nhorse, and thus we went over to the place designated. We had scarcely\r\ndismounted and glanced at the figures, when my father cried out, 'It is\r\nthe Laocoon of which Pliny speaks!' The labourers immediately began\r\ndigging to get the statue out; after having looked at them very\r\ncarefully, we went home to supper, talking all the way of\r\nantiquity.\"[22]\r\n\r\nThus these various forces--the discovery of antique statues, the passion\r\nfor art, the eager Italian intellect, the conception of Rome as the\r\nmistress of culture, the character of Julius II and the genius of\r\nBramante, Michelangelo, and Raphael--worked together to cover the Papacy\r\nwith a pagan glory in its time of religious need. On the other hand, as\r\nthese monumental works required vast sums of money, the sale of\r\nindulgences and the exaction of tribute buzzed on more rapidly than\r\never.\r\n\r\nLeo X (1513-21) has given his name to this age of papal culture, but he\r\nwas not entitled to the honour; he had the inborn Medicean interest and\r\nenjoyment in intellectual matters, a nice taste, and some delicacy of\r\nperception, but it needs no more than a look at his fat jowl in\r\nRaphael's portrait to see that he could not have been a motive force in\r\na great period. He stands on an historic eminence as the last Pope to\r\nwield the Italian sceptre over all Europe, the last to send his\r\ntax-collectors from Sicily to England, from Spain to Norway, the last to\r\nenjoy the full heritage of Imperial Rome.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] _Book of the Courtier_, p. 305, translated by L. E. Opdycke.\r\n\r\n[22] _Rome and the Renaissance_, from the French of Julian Klaczko, p.\r\n93.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nITALY AND THE CATHOLIC REVIVAL (1527-1563)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now come to the beginning of long centuries of national\r\ndegradation, and one has a general sense of passing from a glorious\r\ngarden into a series of gas-lit drawing-rooms, somewhat over-decorated,\r\nwhere naughty princes amuse themselves with bagatelles. We must glance\r\nat the political degradation first.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between the Barbarians of France and Spain for mastery in\r\nItaly, of which we spoke in the last political chapter, was practically\r\ndecided by the battle of Pavia (1525), in which the French king lost all\r\nbut life and honour. France was most reluctant to acquiesce in defeat,\r\nand from time to time marched her troops across the Alps into\r\nunfortunate Piedmont, sometimes of her own notion, and sometimes at the\r\ninvitation of an Italian state; but the Spanish grip was too strong to\r\nbe shaken off. From this time on Italian politics were determined by the\r\npleasure of foreign kings. Two treaties between France and Spain, that\r\nof Cambrai (1529) and that of Cateau-Cambresis (1559), embodied the\r\nresults of their bargains and their wars. The sum and substance of them\r\nwas a practical abandonment by France of her Italian claims, and the map\r\nof Italy was drawn to suit Spain.\r\n\r\nMilan was governed by Spanish governors, Naples and Sicily by Spanish\r\nviceroys. The business of a Spanish viceroy, then as always, was to\r\nraise money. Taxes were oppressive. It was said that in Sicily the royal\r\nofficials nibbled, in Naples they ate, and in Milan they devoured. In\r\naddition to regular taxes, special imposts were laid on various\r\noccasions,--when a new king succeeded to the throne, when a royal heir\r\nwas born, when war was waged against the Lutherans in Germany or the\r\npirates in Africa. In the south, where the people were less intelligent\r\nand laborious, oppressive taxation and unwise government caused a\r\ngradual increase of ignorance and poverty, and left as a legacy to the\r\npresent day the conditions from which spring the _Mafia_ of Sicily and\r\nthe _Camorra_ of Naples.\r\n\r\nIn Florence the sagacious Cosimo I (1537-74) ruled with prudence and\r\nseverity. He understood that his position depended on his fidelity to\r\nSpain and the Papacy, and acted accordingly. He married a Spanish lady,\r\nEleanora of Toledo, daughter to the viceroy of Naples, took up his ducal\r\nresidence first in the Palazzo Vecchio, where there are many\r\nremembrances of his duchess, and afterwards in the great palace, begun\r\nby Luca Pitti, across the Arno. He reduced Siena, once Florence's\r\ndangerous rival, to subjection, and crushed out the last traces of\r\nrepublican sentiment in his duchy. He employed Vasari to design the\r\nUffizi, completed the edifice that holds the Laurentian library, and led\r\nas magnificent a life as a due regard for his purse would allow. In\r\nshort, he was what one would expect an unrefined member of the _Casa\r\nMedici_ to be; and when one recollects that his grandmother was a Sforza\r\nof Milan, all expectations based on heredity are amply satisfied. Cosimo\r\nI left a long line of descendants to sit upon his grand-ducal throne.\r\nTheir marble effigies at the head of the stairway in the Uffizi tell\r\ntheir story. The brutal Sforza vigour and the elegant Medicean\r\nastuteness could not save them from sharing in the general degeneracy\r\nthat spread like a blight over all Italy. However, one must remember\r\nthat they did collect the finest picture gallery in the world and housed\r\nit in the Uffizi and Pitti palaces.\r\n\r\nNorth of Tuscany the petty duchies of Ferrara, Urbino, Modena, Parma,\r\nand Mantua formed a little ducal coterie, very characteristic of the\r\nnext two centuries. The Papacy indeed swallowed up Ferrara (1598) and\r\nUrbino (1631), but the House of Este of Ferrara moved on to Modena, and\r\nremained there till Napoleon's time. In Parma, Pope Paul III (1534-50),\r\nour old acquaintance Alexander Farnese, a careful father as well as a\r\nlucky brother, established his son as duke. This son was bad, and\r\nbelieved to be worse, so the nobles of Parma murdered him; but his\r\ndescendants made good their title, and the little duchy of Parma, with\r\nits palace, its custom-house, its barracks, and its pictures, stepped\r\nforth as one of the petty states of the peninsula, and endured till the\r\nUnion of Italy. Genoa and Lucca were permitted to remain republics.\r\n\r\nUp in the northwest we get our first definite notions of Savoy. This\r\nduchy, built up piecemeal, was a composite state, which included a good\r\ndeal of Piedmont, and portions of what are now France and Switzerland,\r\nand, unfortunately, lay directly in the way of the French armies on\r\ntheir marches into Italy. During the wars of Francis I and Charles V,\r\nthe Duke of Savoy hopefully attempted to maintain neutrality, and, in\r\nconsequence, lost all. France deemed it more convenient to own her line\r\nof march, and annexed Savoy; and for twenty years Piedmont was both\r\ncamping-ground and battleground for the contending nations. It looked as\r\nif Savoy would be blotted from the map of Europe; but Duke Emanuele\r\nFiliberto (1553-80), _Iron Head_, an accomplished soldier, had the sense\r\nto take the winning side. He served in the Spanish army, and, in the\r\nPeace of Cateau-Cambresis, as his share secured the restoration of his\r\nduchy. That portion of this duke's policy which concerns us especially\r\nis that he gave Piedmont precedence over his French and Swiss provinces,\r\nestablished the seat of government at Turin, put the university there\r\nand brought men of letters and science, substituted Italian for Latin in\r\npublic documents, and proclaimed himself an Italian prince and Savoy an\r\nItalian state. He gave Savoy the general character which it has always\r\nretained. He checked the priests, built up the army, reformed the law,\r\nconverted the old feudal dominion into an absolute autocracy, and\r\nstarted his dukedom on the course which ultimately enabled it to play\r\nits great part in the liberation of Italy in the nineteenth century.\r\nEmanuele Filiberto is reputed one of Italy's national heroes.\r\n\r\nVenice had already recovered most of the territories on the mainland of\r\nItaly wrenched from her by the League of Cambrai, but in the East the\r\nTurks steadily took away city, island, and province. After a long period\r\nof war, one gallant exploit gilded the fortunes of the losing side. A\r\nleague against the Turks was effected between Spain, the Papacy, and\r\nVenice, and the united fleets, under the supreme command of Don John of\r\nAustria, won the renowned sea-fight off Lepanto (1571); but except for\r\nchopping off a goodly number of infidel heads and limbs, little was\r\naccomplished. In this battle a young Spanish soldier, Miguel de\r\nCervantes, lost an arm. Soon afterwards peace was made on terms hard for\r\nthe Venetians, but beneficent in that it was destined to last for\r\nseventy years.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the Papacy, and there, in extraordinary contrast to the\r\ndegeneration and decay all around, we find militant vigour and energy.\r\nThis phenomenon is so remarkable that we must glance back at the perils\r\nthrough which the Papacy had passed. Ever since the fall of the Empire\r\n(when the political union of Italy and Germany broke in two) disruptive\r\nforces had been at work to break the ecclesiastical union, until at\r\nlast, in the pontificate of Leo X, Martin Luther affixed his theses\r\nconcerning indulgences to the door of the Castle Church at Wittenberg,\r\nburnt the papal bull, and threw off his allegiance. The North of Europe\r\nfollowed him. The record of the Papacy had been utter failure and worse.\r\nIt had smeared itself from head to foot with simony, nepotism, and vice;\r\nit had cast religion to the winds. No expression of indignation would\r\nhave been adequate without the sack of Rome. A statesman might well\r\nhave predicted that all Europe would dismember and suppress the Papacy\r\nand adopt a system of national churches. Nevertheless, at the end of the\r\ncentury the Papacy stood erect and vigorous, shorn indeed of universal\r\nempire, but reestablished, the Order of Jesus at its right, the Holy\r\nInquisition at its left, draped in piety by the Council of Trent, and\r\nhobnobbing on even terms with kings. The process which effected this\r\nchange is called the Counter-reformation, or the Catholic Reaction. That\r\nprocess was a happy blending of virtue, bigotry, and policy. Borne\r\nupward and onward by the forces of reform and conservatism, the Modern\r\nPapacy rose triumphant on the ruins of the Papacy of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nThe same spirit that caused the Reformation in the North started the\r\nCatholic Revival in the South. A wave, comparable to the old movement\r\nfor Church reform in Hildebrand's time, swept over the Catholic Church,\r\nand lifted the reformers within the Church into power. The South\r\nemulated the North. Catholic zeal rivalled Protestant ardour. Bigotry\r\nfollowed zeal. Moreover, a reformed Papacy found ready allies. The\r\nlogical consequence of Protestantism was personal independence in\r\nreligion, and the next logical step was personal independence in\r\npolitics. Protestant subjects, more especially where their rulers were\r\nCatholics, tended to become disobedient; and monarchs, who stood for\r\nabsolutism and conservatism, found themselves drawn close to an absolute\r\nand conservative Pope. The kings of Spain and the Popes of Rome became\r\nfriends and allies.\r\n\r\nWithin three years after the sack of Rome, Clement crowned Charles V\r\nwith the Imperial crown in Bologna, where, for the last time in Italy,\r\nproclamation was made of a \"Romanorum Imperator semper Augustus, Mundi\r\ntotius Dominus;\" and the Papacy, strengthened at once by its league with\r\nSpain, lifted its head. Further strength came from other sources. The\r\nbrilliant young Spaniard, Ignatius Loyola, founded the Order of Jesus,\r\nwhich vowed itself to poverty, chastity, and obedience to the Papacy\r\n(1534). Spain, too, by the moral effect of example, procured the\r\nInquisition for Italy. From the time of Innocent III, the Dominican\r\nmonks had had charge of preserving the purity of the faith and of\r\npunishing heretics, and they had performed this function with what might\r\nappear to a sceptic sufficient zeal, but during the great racial and\r\nreligious struggle in Spain which ended in the capture of Granada, more\r\nzeal was deemed necessary and the Spanish Inquisition was established.\r\nIts fame spread far and wide. The Spanish viceroys introduced it in a\r\nmodified form in Naples, and Cardinal Caraffa, a zealous reformer, urged\r\nthe need of such an institution in Rome. The Holy Office of Rome was\r\nestablished, and Caraffa put at its head (1542). Heretics were\r\nfrightened into conformity or punished; some were driven out of the\r\ncountry, a few were burned to death. Freedom of thought was vigorously\r\nattacked; and the _Index Librorum Prohibitorum_ was decreed. The great\r\nand growing power of the reformers may be measured by the fact that the\r\nPope who sanctioned these great bulwarks of the papal system was the\r\nonce gay Alexander Farnese, Paul III, whom we otherwise know as a\r\nbrother and a father. The culminating exhibition of the power of the\r\nreformers, however, was in the Council of Trent (1545-63).\r\n\r\nEurope had been too long accustomed to the idea of ecclesiastical unity\r\nto sit still without some attempt at reconciliation between the\r\nCatholics and Protestants. It was hoped that a Council would heal all\r\nwounds, smooth all difficulties, and bring back the irrevocable past.\r\nThe Popes, however, had come to regard Councils as inimical bodies with\r\ndangerous tendencies towards investigation and with hostile canons, and\r\nwere inclined to take the risk of losing the tainted parts of\r\nChristendom altogether, rather than make use of so perilous an\r\ninstrument to recover them. But the Emperor, Charles V, was insistent;\r\nhis Empire, as well as the Church, was cracked, and in great danger of\r\nbreaking in two. The Council was convoked, and met at Trent. The primary\r\nobject was reconciliation; but everybody knew that no reconciliation was\r\npossible without radical reforms in the Church, so the papal party\r\nplayed its cards with exceeding wariness. The Lutherans did not attend,\r\nand the papal party, in order to forestall practical reforms, plunged\r\ninto the comparatively safe matter of defining dogma, and defined it in\r\nsuch a way as to fence out all the Lutheran schismatics. The reformers,\r\nnevertheless, managed to sandwich in between the definitions of dogma\r\nvarious decrees for the reform of Church discipline. In Catholic theory\r\nan Ecumenical Council acts under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost; but\r\nlooking at this Council from a purely secular point of view, it is hard\r\nto find other guidance than the quarrelling interests of Pope, bishops,\r\nEmperor, Spaniards, French, and Italians. In fact, the Council was twice\r\nbroken up. The first time the Pope, having taken alarm, declared the\r\nCouncil adjourned to Bologna. The second time the Lutherans, then at war\r\nwith the Emperor, swooped down near Trent and frightened the Council\r\naway. It met again, for the third time. All hope of reconciliation with\r\nthe Protestants had then passed away, and the Council set to work as a\r\npurely Roman Catholic partisan body. A striking change of attitude\r\nwithin the Council showed that since the early sessions the reforming\r\nparty had won complete control. Paul IV (1555-59), a man of high\r\ncharacter, formerly Cardinal Caraffa, head of the Roman Inquisition, had\r\npromulgated many edicts concerning reforms; and his successor Pius IV,\r\nGiovanni Angelo Medici of Milan (not of the Florentine family)\r\n(1559-66), who was Pope during the final sessions of the Council,\r\nfollowed his lead. Pius, a clever man who had received a legal training,\r\ninstead of wasting efforts in persuading disputatious bishops, first\r\nmade diplomatic arrangements with the Catholic sovereigns of Spain,\r\nFrance, and Austria, and then secured the embodiment of those\r\narrangements in decrees by the Council. Nothing, however, could have\r\nbeen accomplished without the reforming spirit within the Church; Pius\r\nremoved obstacles in its way and let it have full play. Stern rules were\r\nmade against the corrupt practices, which had given Luther his\r\nstrength. Canons regulated the conduct of the clergy, the duties of\r\nbishops, the affairs of monasteries and nunneries, and all matters\r\nconnected with the great organization of the Roman Church. These reforms\r\ncame too late to affect Protestant opinion, but they rallied the\r\ndoubting, confirmed the faithful, and gave the Papacy wide-reaching\r\nmoral support. The dogmas of the Church were cast in adamant, and\r\nsecured the immense advantage of definiteness and fixity. The Council of\r\nTrent remains the principal monument of the Catholic Revival, and that\r\nRevival is certainly the most important event for Italy in the period\r\nimmediately following the Renaissance. Pius IV, the clever lawyer, had a\r\ngreat share in the work of the Council, but his most skilful achievement\r\nwas to maintain and confirm the doctrine of the subordination of\r\nCouncils to the Papacy. This great stroke, as well as his share in the\r\nreforms, has won for him the title of founder of the Modern Papacy.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the Papacy prospered during the very generations in which\r\nthe greatness of Italy dwindled away. The fortunes of the two had wholly\r\nparted company. The Papacy, indeed, had made itself an Italian\r\ninstitution,--never again would it seat a foreigner on the chair of St.\r\nPeter,--but in all other ways it had ceased to have any national\r\naffections. Italy, her genius faded, her vigour faint, not only deprived\r\nof what might have been a great support, but even pushed down and held\r\nunder by the help of her own greatest creation, the Church, ceased to be\r\na country. She had become, in Metternich's famous phrase, a mere\r\ngeographical expression, an aggregate of little states, with no tie\r\nbetween them except that of juxtaposition and of common subservience to\r\nforeigners. If we look at a map drawn at the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, we shall find the following political divisions:--\r\n\r\n  The Duchy of Savoy,\r\n  The Spanish province of Lombardy,\r\n  The Republic of Venice,\r\n  The little Duchy of Parma, under the Farnesi,\r\n  The little Duchy of Mantua, under the Gonzaga,\r\n  The little Duchy of Modena, under the Este family,\r\n  The little Duchy of Urbino, under the della Rovere who had succeeded\r\n    to the Montefeltri,\r\n  The Republic of Genoa,\r\n  The Republic of Lucca,\r\n  The Grand Duchy of Tuscany, under the Medici,\r\n  The Papal States,\r\n  The Spanish province of Naples,\r\n  The Spanish province of Sicily.\r\n\r\nOver them all, Spanish provinces, independent republics, Italian\r\nduchies, and Papal States, falls the shadow cast by the royal standard\r\nof Spain. Next to our consciousness of that dreaded banner, the most\r\nvivid impression which we take away is the contrast between the vigour\r\nof the Papacy and the weakness of Italy, and we draw the necessary\r\ninference that the fortunes of the two not only have wholly parted\r\ncompany, but also are wholly irreconcilable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE CINQUECENTO (16TH CENTURY)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Cinquecento_, as the Italians call the sixteenth century, exhibits\r\nin the arts the same disintegration and decay that we have found in the\r\npolitical life of Italy. Honesty, independence, genuineness fade away,\r\nand in their stead we find cleverness and effort. The high tide of the\r\nRenaissance was in the pontificate of Julius II, but the flood lingered\r\non at the full till 1540, and then the ebb began. This is the date which\r\nthe famous German scholar and critic, Jakob Burckhardt, assigns as the\r\nlimit of the Golden Age; and it is interesting to find how closely it\r\ncorresponds with the political dates which marked the establishment of\r\nthe new political order in Italy. In 1530 Florence was definitely handed\r\nover to the Medici; in 1535 the duchy of Milan was annexed to Spain; in\r\n1540 the Pope sanctioned the Order of Jesus; in 1542 he established the\r\nHoly Office in Rome; in 1543 he accepted the scheme of an _Index\r\nLibrorum Prohibitorum_; and in 1545 the Council of Trent was opened.\r\n\r\nThe change from maturity to decay was all-pervasive; yet it was slow,\r\nand a period of excellence and good taste intervened between the High\r\nRenaissance and the Baroque. This process is most clearly marked in\r\narchitecture. During the High Renaissance dignity was law, the grand\r\nmanner dominated, and charm determined subordinate parts. Domes were\r\nnoble, loggias elegant, pilasters decorative, cornices well\r\nproportioned, ceilings splendid. After 1540 indications of decline\r\nappeared; but this fading brilliance was a kind of _goetterdaemmerung_,\r\nand, though it heralded the Baroque, displayed at times a purity of\r\ndetail and a noble restraint worthy of the earlier period.\r\n\r\nOf the architects of this intervening stage the greatest was Giacomo\r\nBarozzi, surnamed Vignola after the little town where he was born in the\r\nprovince of Modena. He was a man of theories, had great knowledge of\r\nclassical architecture, and wrote a manual on the architectural orders\r\nwhich enjoyed great authority for two centuries and more. He built\r\nvarious buildings at Bologna, and designed a gigantic palace at Piacenza\r\nfor the Farnesi, the ducal children of Alexander Farnese, Paul III, and\r\nnephews of the beautiful Giulia. The art of making gardens, of using\r\ncypress trees, greensward, pools, terraces, and clumps of ilex as joint\r\npartners with stone, brick, and stucco, in one artistic whole, had come\r\ninto being in the sixteenth century; and Vignola was one of the masters\r\nof this new art. He designed the Farnese gardens on the Palatine Hill,\r\nsince destroyed by time, neglect, subsequent owners, and eager\r\narchaeologists. He was an artist of great ideas, and sometimes caught the\r\ngrand manner. On the other hand, he also helped to bring on the Baroque.\r\nHis famous church at Rome, the Gesu, despite its vast, high-arching\r\nnave, lent itself with fatal facility to a gorgeous hideousness of\r\ndecoration, and set the fashion for many imitative Jesuit churches,\r\nwhich caught the hideous gorgeousness but missed the grandeur of their\r\nexemplar. He had an important part in building the _Villa di Papa\r\nGiulio_ (Pope Julius III), a little outside the city walls, charming in\r\nits grace, its variety, and its succession of arcades, courts, loggias,\r\nbalustrades, grotto, terrace, and garden.\r\n\r\nThe next in rank, Bartolommeo Ammanati of Florence, may be called the\r\ncourt architect of Duke Cosimo I. He built two bridges across the Arno,\r\nthe Ponte alia Carraia and the Ponte Santa Trinita, finished the main\r\nbody of the Pitti Palace, originally designed by Brunelleschi, and\r\ncompleted the elaborate Boboli garden, the pleasure grounds behind the\r\npalace. He also was drawn to Rome at the behest of villa-building Popes,\r\nand had a share in elaborating the plans of the Villa of Papa Giulio.\r\nGiorgio Vasari, architect, painter, biographer, designed the Uffizi at\r\nFlorence, painted many indifferent pictures, and wrote \"Lives of the\r\nPainters,\" a garrulous, discursive, inaccurate, and delightful book.\r\nGaleazzo Alessi of Perugia built the stately, tourist-haunted palaces of\r\nGenoa, once occupied by opulent merchants, and also the gigantic church\r\nof S. Maria degli Angeli, which covers the Portiuncula of St. Francis,\r\nlike a bowl turned over a forget-me-not. Jacopo Tatti Sansovino of\r\nFlorence was the architect of many noble buildings in Venice. Andrea\r\nPalladio of Vicenza embodied his passionate love of classical\r\narchitecture in palaces and churches in his native town and in Venice.\r\nDuring the revival of classic enthusiasm in the eighteenth century\r\nPalladio became a demi-god. The captivated Goethe, as soon as he arrived\r\nat Vicenza, hurried to see the Palladian palaces. \"When we stand face to\r\nface with these buildings, then we first realize their great excellence;\r\ntheir bulk and massiveness fill the eye, while the lovely harmony of\r\ntheir proportions, admirable in the advance and retreat of perspective,\r\nbrings peace to the spirit.\" In Venice, he says, \"Before all things I\r\nhastened to the Carita.... Alas! scarcely a tenth part of the edifice is\r\nfinished. However, even this part is worthy of that heavenly genius....\r\nOne ought to pass whole years in the contemplation of such a work.\"\r\n\r\nThese men and their rivals kept alive the traditions of the great\r\nperiod; nevertheless, in course of time stiltedness and exaggeration\r\nusurped the place of elegance and force. A servile imitation of Roman\r\nmodels, an absolute acceptance of classical correctness, prevailed; the\r\nclassic orders, especially the Corinthian, spread themselves everywhere;\r\nin one place barren and formal simplicity obtruded itself, in another\r\npretentious magnificence. After 1580 the transition is complete; the\r\nbaroque triumphs; sham tyrannizes, wood and plaster mimic stone, columns\r\ntwist themselves awry; monstrous scrolls, heavy mouldings, crazy\r\nstatues, gilt deformities, and all the contortions to which stucco and\r\nother cohesive substances will submit, hang and cling everywhere, inside\r\nand out. But this is to anticipate, for the full revel of the Baroque\r\ntakes place in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe same degeneration prevailed in sculpture. Michelangelo, in his\r\nstatues in the Medicean chapel at Florence, \"Night\" and \"Day,\" \"Evening\"\r\nand \"Dawn\" (1529-34), had achieved the utmost which thought and emotion\r\ncould express in marble. They stand, pillars set up by Hercules, at the\r\nend of the noble sculpture of the Renaissance. His successors tried to\r\nimitate him, in vain; they produced bulk, or writhing or distortion. Yet\r\nsome men of this period did excellent work: Benvenuto Cellini, delicate\r\ngoldsmith, and sculptor of the Florentine Perseus; John of Bologna, who\r\nmodelled the Flying Mercury; Taddeo Landini of Florence, who designed\r\nthe charming fountain in Rome, in which several boys are boosting\r\nturtles into a basin above; Bandinelli, whose big statues are familiar\r\nin Florence, \"a man strangely composed,\" as Burckhardt says, \"of natural\r\ntalent, of reminiscence of the old school, and of a false originality\r\nwhich carried him beyond a disregard of nicety even to grossness.\" After\r\nthese men and a few others, sculpture followed architecture in its\r\nfacile descent into the Baroque, and expressed itself in prophets,\r\nsaints, and Popes, who stand in swaying and vacillating postures in nave\r\nand aisle, on roof and balustrade. These decadent sculptors strictly\r\nbelong to the next century; they are but heralded by the last works of\r\nthe Cinquecento.\r\n\r\nIn painting, too, the same story is repeated all over Italy. In Florence\r\nafter the close of the High Renaissance twilight darkened rapidly. There\r\nare few artists of note except two fashionable portrait painters,\r\nPontormo and Bronzino, who display the characteristics of the period.\r\nBronzino's picture of the Descent of Christ into Hades almost justifies\r\nRuskin's comment, a \"heap of cumbrous nothingness and sickening\r\noffensiveness;\" on the other hand, Pontormo's decorations in the great\r\nhall of the Medicean Villa at Poggio a Caiano are as graceful, gay, and\r\ncharming as can well be imagined. After them in dreary succession come\r\nthe decadent painters, who painted figures bigger and bigger in would-be\r\nMichelangelesque attitudes, as may be seen in one of the rooms of the\r\n_Belle Arti_ in Florence. Elsewhere, also, the generation bred under the\r\ngreat masters faded away,--the sweet Luini of Milan, Leonardo's\r\nfollower; the facile Giulio Romano, Raphael's pupil; the beauty-loving\r\nSodoma of Siena; the romantic Dosso Dossi of Ferrara. These names show\r\nhow loath the genius of painting was to leave Italy, but she obeyed\r\nfate; and, at the end of the century, we have the Caracci beginning to\r\npaint in Bologna, and Caravaggio (1569-1609) in Naples. It needs but a\r\nglance at these later pictures to see what a change had come over the\r\nspirit of beauty during the hundred years since Botticelli painted Venus\r\nfresh from the salt sea foam.\r\n\r\nIn literature, also, at the opening of the sixteenth century, we had the\r\nhistorian, Guicciardini; the political writer, Machiavelli; the poet,\r\nAriosto; the cultivated Castiglione: at the end we have the pathetic\r\nfigure of Torquato Tasso (1544-95), who stands drooping, like a symbol\r\nof Italy. Tasso is always inscribed in textbooks as one of the four\r\ngreatest Italian poets, and it would be useless and impertinent to\r\ndispute the concordant testimony of many witnesses. Byron apostrophizes\r\nhim, \"O victor unsurpassed in modern song;\" yet one with difficulty\r\navoids thinking that his sad story has added to the beauty of his poetry\r\nand heightened his reputation.\r\n\r\nTorquato Tasso was the last great genius of the Italian Renaissance, and\r\nstands there facing the oncoming decadence in gifted helplessness; he\r\nhad many talents, a noble nature, a melancholy temperament, and a weak\r\ncharacter. In boyhood his religious emotions and his intellectual\r\nfaculties were both over-stimulated. His story is a medley of court\r\nfavour, success, rivalry, suspicion. His home was Ferrara, but he\r\nwandered about, as a sick person seeks to ease his body by changing\r\nposture. Early forcing and some natural weakness combined to bring too\r\ngreat a strain upon his mind, which gave way, and the unfortunate man\r\nwas put in a madhouse by his patron, the Duke of Ferrara. He was\r\nconfined for seven years, but not ill treated. He died in the monastery\r\nof Sant' Onofrio on the Janiculum at Rome, where tourists stop to gaze at\r\nthe poor remnant of an oak tree, under whose shade he used to sit.\r\nCarducci, the great poet, says: \"Italy's great literature, the living,\r\nnational, and at the same time, human literature, with which she\r\nreconciled Antiquity and the Middle Ages, and, in a Roman way,\r\nrepresented a renewed Europe, ended with Tasso.\" His sad story is a\r\nfitting epilogue to the Italian Renaissance.\r\n\r\nThis general course of ascent, culmination, and decline holds true even\r\nof Venice, except in chronology; for Venice preserved her independence\r\nfrom the normal Italian experience almost as resolutely in the arts as\r\nin politics. She produced no literature, piqued perhaps because Italy\r\nhad taken the Tuscan dialect rather than hers for the national language;\r\nbut in the arts, after decay had elsewhere set in, she bloomed in the\r\nfulness of perfection, as late roses blossom when other bushes show\r\nnothing but hips. Of her individual career a few words must be said.\r\n\r\nIn architecture and sculpture, the Lombardi, a Venetian family probably\r\nfrom Lombardy, flourished for nearly a hundred years (1452-1537), and\r\nleft their mark on Venice, in tombs and statues, in churches and\r\npalaces. Contemporary with the last generation of Lombardi came the more\r\ngifted Alessandro Leopardi, who completed the great statue of Colleoni\r\ndesigned by Verrocchio, and gave a new impulse to Venetian sculpture.\r\nWhile the Tuscan sculptors had been studying Roman remains, the Isles of\r\nGreece had been giving Greek models to their Venetian conquerors, and\r\nLeopardi in particular profited greatly by them. In the sister art the\r\nfirst famous architect after the Lombardi was the Florentine, Jacopo\r\nSansovino, who spent most of a long life in Venice, where he built the\r\nZecca, the Loggetta, the Libreria Vecchia (the Old Library), and also\r\nthe Scala d'Oro (the Golden Stairway) of the ducal palace. Sanmicheli, a\r\nmilitary engineer, as well as a builder of palaces, came from Verona to\r\nwork in Venice. Palladio (1508-80), of whom we have spoken, came from\r\nVicenza, and bequeathed his name to the neo-classic style, known as\r\nPalladian.\r\n\r\nIn painting first came the famous Bellini family, Jacopo (1400-64?) and\r\nhis two sons, Gentile and the more gifted Giovanni, painter of tenderest\r\nMadonnas; after them came Carpaccio, painter of St. Jerome and his lion,\r\nand of St. George and his dragon. Then followed in rapid succession the\r\nmost gifted group of painters that ever lived together, all born within\r\ntwenty years of one another, as if to prove how prodigally Nature could\r\nendow a petty province that had the luck to please her: Giorgione, from\r\nCastelfranco on the Venetian mainland, of highest fame and disputed\r\npictures; Titian, of Cadore, noblest of portrait painters; Palma\r\nVecchio, of Bergamo, creator of the most glorious of animals, the superb\r\nVenetian women; Sebastiano del Piombo, who painted the Fornarina of the\r\nUffizi Gallery long attributed to Raphael, and deserved his fortune of\r\nbeing pupil to Giorgione and friend to Michelangelo; Lorenzo Lotto, of\r\nBergamo, another painter of exquisite women, high-bred men, noble\r\nsaints, and poetical angels; Giovanni Antonio da Pordenone, inferior\r\nonly to Titian; Bonifazio from Verona, painter of patrician luxury;\r\nParis Bordone, of Treviso, so uncertain in merit, yet at his best so\r\nrich in hue, so tender in sentiment, so admirable in his pictures of\r\nVenetian ceremonial; and at the close, the giant Tintoretto (1512-94)\r\nand Paolo Veronese (1528-88) the glorious: all, though in different\r\ndegrees, splendid in colour, voluptuous ministers to the sensuous eye.\r\nThis cluster of names serves to show that while elsewhere in Italy art\r\nwas dwindling into mannerism and exaggeration, Venice put forth an\r\nextraordinary burst of pictorial magnificence; yet even in Venice at\r\nthe end of the century none of the great men were left.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this decadence of the arts from their splendour in the\r\nearly decades of the century is not easy to assign; no one can say why\r\ngenius spurts up in one spot or in one individual, why the brilliant\r\nItalian race should have achieved so many masterpieces and then have\r\nbecome ineffectual. One can merely notice, whether as a cause or an\r\naccompanying phenomenon, that, with individual exceptions,--no man could\r\nbe nobler than Michelangelo,--Italy of the High Renaissance was a great\r\nmoral failure. In intellectual achievement the Italians eclipsed the\r\nworld; in morality they stumbled about like blind men. This lack of\r\nmorality finds its fullest expression, at least its most conspicuous\r\nexpression, at the very time of the culmination of the arts. Let me\r\nillustrate.\r\n\r\nThe night that the Duke of Gandia, son of Pope Borgia, was murdered in\r\nRome (1497), a wood-seller, living beside the Tiber, saw several men\r\ncome cautiously to the river. They peered about and made a sign to some\r\none behind. Up came a horseman, with a dead body lying across his\r\nhorse's back, head and heels dangling down; the horse was turned rump to\r\nthe river, and two men on foot seized the body and flung it into the\r\nwater. The wood-seller was asked why he had not reported the fact. He\r\nanswered that he had seen some hundred bodies thrown into the river at\r\nthat spot, and had never heard any inquiries made. The duke's brother,\r\nCaesar, was at the time believed to have done the deed, but evidence\r\nfails.\r\n\r\nThe same Caesar Borgia, bearing the somewhat ambitious motto _Aut Caesar\r\naut nihil_, energetic, ruthless, vigorous, ingenious, and plausible,\r\nembodied the Italian conception of what a political leader should be; so\r\nmuch so, that Machiavelli, the greatest of Italian political writers,\r\ncites him as a model. Machiavelli was a patriot, animated by real love\r\nof his country, but he was free from our conceptions of morality, or\r\nperhaps sceptical of Italian virtue, and believed that the achievement\r\nof liberating Italy from foreign tyranny could only be accomplished by\r\nthe qualities of an Iago. In the chapter in \"The Prince\" entitled \"In\r\nwhat manner Princes should keep faith,\" he says: \"How praiseworthy it is\r\nfor a Prince to keep faith, to practise integrity and eschew trickery,\r\neverybody knows; nevertheless, within our own lifetime and our own\r\nexperience, we know that those Princes have done great things who have\r\nmade small account of good faith and have known how to turn men's heads\r\nby means of trickery, and in the end have surpassed those who planted\r\nthemselves on loyalty.... Therefore a prudent lord ought not to keep\r\nfaith, when keeping faith would make against him, and the reasons which\r\nmade him promise are no more. If men were all good this precept would\r\nnot be good; but as they are bad and would not keep faith with you, you,\r\ntoo, ought not to keep faith with them; and a Prince will never lack\r\nlegitimate reasons to colour the breach.... I shall even make bold to\r\nsay this, that to have certain moral qualities and always observe them\r\nis bad, but to seem to have them is good; as to seem to be pious,\r\nfaithful, kind, religious, honest, or even to be so, provided your mind\r\nbe so adjusted that, in case of need, you will know how to be the\r\nopposite. For you must know that a Prince, and especially a newly\r\ncrowned Prince, cannot do all the things for which men are esteemed\r\ngood, for, in order to maintain the state, they are often obliged to act\r\ncontrary to humanity, contrary to charity, contrary to religion;\r\ntherefore, he must have a mind prompt to veer with the wind and the\r\nfluctuations of fortune; and, as I have said, not to forsake the good,\r\nif may be, but to know how to cleave to evil, if he must.\"\r\n\r\nAnother illustration shall be the life of Pietro Aretino (1492-1557),\r\nborn the child of an artist's model in a hospital at Arezzo, who, by wit\r\nand infinite impudence, by toadying, bullying, and blackmail, worked his\r\nway to such a position that he could say, \"Without serving courts I have\r\ncompelled the great world, dukes, princes, kings, to pay tribute to my\r\ngenius.\" Once a pious lady, the Marchesa di Pesaro, remonstrated with\r\nhim upon his life, and bade him mend his ways. He wrote back: \"I must\r\nsay that I am not less useful to the world, or less pleasing to Jesus,\r\nspending my vigils upon trifles than if I had employed them on works of\r\npiety. But why do I do this? If princes were as devout as I am needy, my\r\npen would write nothing but _misereres_.... Let us see. I have a friend\r\nnamed Brucioli, who dedicated his translation of the Bible to the Most\r\nChristian King [of France]. Four years passed and he got no answer. On\r\nthe other hand, my comedy, 'The Courtesan,' won a rich necklace from\r\nthis same king; so that my Courtesan would have felt tempted to make fun\r\nof the Old Testament, if that were not a trifle unbecoming. Forgive me\r\nlady for the jests I have written, not from malice, but for a\r\nlivelihood. All the world does not possess the inspiration of divine\r\ngrace. Music and comedy are to us what prayer and preaching are to you.\r\nMay Jesus grant you His grace to get for me from Sebastiano di Pesaro\r\n[her husband?] the rest of the money of which I have only received\r\nthirty scudi; for this I am in anticipation your debtor.\" Of Pietro\r\nAretino a recent Italian critic says: \"His memory is infamous; no\r\ngentleman would mention his name before a lady.\" Yet, perhaps, we may\r\ndoubt if he was peculiarly bad; he possessed the cynical views of\r\nmorality current at the time. Aretino made a fortune, received\r\nknighthood from the Pope, nearly obtained a cardinal's hat, and was\r\npainted by Titian.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote is taken from the autobiography of the famous\r\ngoldsmith and sculptor, Benvenuto Cellini (1500-71). He was travelling\r\non a sort of canal boat on his way from Venice to Florence. \"We went to\r\nlodge for the night in an inn on this side of Chioggia, on the left as\r\nwe were approaching Ferrara. Our host wished to be paid, according to\r\nhis custom, before we went to bed. I told him that in other places it\r\nwas the custom to pay in the morning, but he said, 'I wish to be paid,\r\naccording to my way, in the evening.' I replied that men who wanted\r\ntheir own special way would have to make a world to suit their special\r\nway, because in this world that was not the way things were done. The\r\nhost answered that I need not vex my wits, for he wished to do according\r\nto his way. My companion was trembling for fear, and poked me to be\r\nquiet lest the host do worse; so we paid him, according to his way, and\r\nwent to bed. We had excellent new beds, everything new, spick and span;\r\nin spite of this I did not sleep a wink, thinking all night long what I\r\ncould do to revenge myself; first I thought of setting fire to the\r\nhouse, next of cutting the throats of the four good horses that he had\r\nin his stable; I could see that this would be easy to do, but not how it\r\nwould be easy for me and my companion to escape afterwards. At last I\r\nhit on a plan. In the morning I put my companion and all the things into\r\nthe canal boat. When the horses were hitched to the rope that pulled the\r\nboat, I said that they must not start the boat till I got back, as I had\r\nleft a pair of slippers in my room.... When I got in the room I took my\r\nknife, which was sharp as a razor, and I cut the mattresses on the four\r\nbeds to little bits, so that I knew I had done more than fifty scudi\r\nworth of damage.\" Throughout a delightful autobiography, which we need\r\nnot accept too literally, Cellini exhibits a perfectly unmoral\r\ndisposition, a mind with no sense of social law and no respect for\r\nanything except Michelangelo and art.\r\n\r\nThese four men, Caesar Borgia, Machiavelli, Aretino, and Cellini,\r\npossessed fortitude, energy, subtlety, and courage, but they showed no\r\nappreciation of the fundamental social virtues, loyalty, trust,\r\nsubordination of self to the general good; and for this reason they\r\nenable us to understand why Italy fell like a ripe apple, without\r\nresistance, into the lap of foreigners and lay helpless under Jesuit,\r\ninquisitor, petty duke, and Spanish viceroy, and why freedom to think\r\nand freedom to act faded from art and intellectual life as well as from\r\npolitical life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nA SURVEY OF ITALY (1580-1581)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the sixteenth century Italy is well under way on a new\r\nstretch of history, which lasted until the nineteenth century. Except\r\nVenice, always individual, and the Papacy, freshly revivified, Italy has\r\nlost all moral force, and become wholly effeminate. In twenty-five years\r\nthree hundred and twenty-six volumes of sonnets were published. Her\r\npolitical life has become what one may call grand-ducal; her religion\r\nformal, superstitious; her literature affected, stilted; her\r\narchitecture Baroque; her painting and sculpture steeped in mannerism\r\nand exaggeration. Nevertheless, Italy is Italy, and has her own charm,\r\nher own individuality, her own coquetry. As formerly she lured Barbarian\r\nnations, so now she lures individual Barbarians, and becomes the\r\nroaming-ground of travellers. She seems less a real country than a\r\ntheatre, where rococo dukes, cavaliers, and ladies curl their hair and\r\npowder their cheeks.\r\n\r\nFor two centuries this artificial existence continued. Its history is\r\nnot to be found in the solemn volumes of Cesare Cantu, Carlo Botta, or\r\nother Italian historians, but in the journals of German, French, and\r\nEnglish travellers: for during these centuries Italy was not a country\r\nin either a political or a sentimental sense; it was a place of\r\nrecreation for gentlemen on the grand tour, pious folk bound Romeward,\r\nvirtuosi seeking classical remains, and elderly statesmen hoping to cure\r\nthe gout. The several petty states were so many artificial gardens,\r\nwhere the peasants wore pretty costumes, the dukes sang prize songs, the\r\nduchesses trilled _tra la la_ in rival endeavour, and the ecclesiastics\r\ntrolled out the chorus. It was the Italian opera bouffe on the most\r\ncharming stage in the world. The best summary of the history of the\r\ncoming century will be a series of extracts from the diary of a\r\nkeen-witted French gentleman, travelling for pleasure, Michel de\r\nMontaigne, who, in the company of some friends, spent several months in\r\nItaly (1580-81). They crossed the Alps over the Brenner Pass and went by\r\nway of Trent. Montaigne's diary is sometimes written in the second and\r\nsometimes in the third person. He describes many of the principal\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nVERONA (within the territory of the Republic of Venice).\r\n\"Without health certificates which they had got at Trent they could not\r\nhave entered the city, although there was no rumour of any danger of\r\npest; but it is the custom (in order to cheat us of the few pennies they\r\ncost). We went to see the cathedral, where Montaigne deemed the\r\nbehaviour of the men at High Mass very peculiar; they chatted even in\r\nthe choir of the church, standing up, with their hats on and their backs\r\nturned to the altar, and did not seem to pay any attention to the\r\nservice except on the elevation of the Host. There were organs and\r\nviolins to accompany the mass.... We went to see the castle and were\r\nshown all over by the lieutenant in charge. The [Venetian] government\r\nkeeps sixty soldiers there, rather, according to what they said to\r\nMontaigne, against the people of the city than against foreigners. We\r\nalso saw a congregation of monks called the Gesuati of St. Jerome [not\r\nJesuits]. They are not priests; they neither say mass nor preach; most\r\nof them are ignorant, but they carry on a business of distilling\r\nlemon-flower water, both in Verona and elsewhere. They are dressed in\r\nwhite, with little white caps, and a dark brown gown over it;\r\ngood-looking young men.\" They visited the Ghetto (Jews' quarter), and\r\nthe Roman amphitheatre, which Montaigne thought the noblest building he\r\nhad ever seen.\r\n\r\nVICENZA. \"It is a big city, a little smaller than Verona, all\r\nfull of palaces of the nobility.\" The fair, which was held twice a year,\r\nwas going on upon the parade-ground; booths had been built on purpose,\r\nand no shops in the city were allowed to keep open. In the town there\r\nwas another establishment of the Gesuati, selling their perfumes and\r\nalso medicines for every ailment. \"These monks tell us that they whip\r\nthemselves every day; each one has his switch at his post in the\r\noratory, where they meet at certain hours of the day and pray, but they\r\nhave no singing.... The old wine has given out, which vexed me, as it is\r\nnot good for me, on account of my colic, to drink the new wines, though\r\nthey are very good in their way.\" From Vicenza they journeyed by a broad\r\nstraight road, ditched on either side and raised a little, which ran\r\nthrough a fertile champaign with mountains in the distance, to\r\nPADUA. The inns here could not be compared with German inns\r\nexcept that they were cheaper by a third. \"The streets narrow and ugly,\r\nnot many people, few handsome houses. We went about all the next day and\r\nsaw the schools of fencing, dancing, and riding, where there were more\r\nthan a hundred French gentlemen together.\" In fact, young men went in\r\ngreat numbers, young Frenchmen in particular, to the schools of Padua,\r\nless to acquire a knowledge of books than to acquire the accomplishments\r\nwhich were then the mode. One of Montaigne's party stopped here and\r\nfound good lodging for seven crowns a month, and \"he might have lodged a\r\nvalet for five crowns more; ordinarily, however, they do not have\r\nvalets, only a general servant for the house, or else maids; every one\r\nhas a nice bedroom, but fire and lights in the bedroom are extra. The\r\naccommodation was very good, and you can live there very reasonably, and\r\nthat, I think, is the reason why many strangers go there to live, even\r\nthose who are not students.\"\r\n\r\nVENICE. Here he dined with the French ambassador \"very well;\"\r\namong other things \"that the ambassador told him this seemed odd, that\r\nhe had no social relations whatever with anybody in the city, because\r\nthe people were so suspicious that a [Venetian] gentleman who should\r\nspeak to him twice would fall under distrust.\" One is inclined, however,\r\nconsidering the fate of Milan, to regard a certain distrust of\r\nforeigners as not unnatural. Montaigne thought that the four most\r\nremarkable things about Venice were the situation, the police, the\r\nPiazza of St. Mark's, and the crowds of foreigners. He received as a\r\ngift a little book of \"Letters\" from a Venetian lady, one of that\r\ncelebrated class of Venetian women who were outside the matrimonial pale\r\nyet lived in ostentatious luxury, recognized by the government and by\r\nmasculine society. This lady at mid-life had changed her ways and\r\ndevoted herself to literature, and hearing of the famous French author,\r\nsent him her book.\r\n\r\nReturning by way of Padua, Montaigne passed the sulphur springs,\r\nfrequented in May and August by the fashionable sick, who took mud or\r\nvapour baths and drank the waters. He noted the canals; the system of\r\nirrigation in the plains, where rows of vine-laden trees intersected\r\nfields of wheat; the big, strong, gray oxen; the broad mud flats, once\r\nswamps, which the government was struggling to reclaim.\r\n\r\nROVIGO, a little town in Venetian territory near the Adige.\r\n\"There is as great abundance of meat here as in France, whatever it may\r\nbe the custom to say, and though they use no lard for the roast, they do\r\nnot take away the savour. The bedrooms, because there is no glass and\r\nthey don't shut the windows, are not so clean as in France; the beds are\r\nbetter made, smoother, and well supplied with mattresses, but they have\r\nnothing but coarse coverings, and they are very sparing of white sheets;\r\nif a man travels alone, or with little style, he won't get any. It is\r\nabout as dear as in France, or a little dearer.\"\r\n\r\nHe crossed the Po, as he had crossed the Adige, upon some kind of\r\npontoon bridge, and went on to\r\n\r\nFERRARA (duchy of Ferrara), where he was delayed on account of\r\nhis health certificate. The ducal regulations on this point were very\r\nparticular. On the door of every room in the inn was written up,\r\n\"Remember the health certificate;\" immediately on arrival, names of\r\ntravellers were reported to the magistrates. Montaigne found most of the\r\nstreets broad and straight, all paved with bricks; there were many\r\npalaces, but few people, and he missed the porticos of Padua, so\r\nconvenient against the rain. He _did_ the town, paid his respects to the\r\nduke, saw Tasso in the madhouse, and found the lemon-flower distilling\r\nGesuates again.\r\n\r\nAt BOLOGNA (in the Papal States), a large, fine city, bigger\r\nthan Ferrara, and with many more people; he also found young Frenchmen\r\ncome to learn riding and fencing. He admired the fine porticos, that\r\ncovered almost every sidewalk, the handsome palaces, the buildings of\r\nthe _School of Sciences_, the bronze statue of Neptune designed by John\r\nof Bologna, and enjoyed a company of players. \"The cost of living was\r\nabout the same as at Padua, very reasonable; but the city is less\r\npeaceful in the older quarters, which make debatable land between the\r\npartisans of different nations, on one side always the French, and on\r\nthe other the Spaniards, who are there in great numbers.\"\r\n\r\nThis unpeaceful and factional condition was not confined to Bologna, but\r\nspread throughout the Papal States. Even fifty years later a perplexed\r\nvisitor to Ravenna wrote: \"The city is divided, as you know, into\r\nGuelfs and Ghibellines, so much so that one man won't go to another's\r\nchurch, and each side has its place in the public square; a tailor who\r\nworks for one need not look for employment from the other, and so with\r\nall the trades; they distinguish one faction from the other by the way\r\nthey wear their hair, their caps,\" etc. But these pale shadows of the\r\ngreat old parties were slight inconveniences compared with the banditti,\r\nwho also decked themselves with old names, and, under pretence of\r\nfighting one another, robbed, burnt, pillaged, and murdered with perfect\r\nimpartiality. The soldiers and the common people united against these\r\nrascals, but they were too strong to be utterly extirpated. In the Papal\r\nStates, one Piccolomini, a member of a famous Sienese family, raided\r\nwhere he chose, and once led a band of two hundred men within a mile or\r\ntwo of the walls of Rome. Terms were made with him, for he was under the\r\nprotection of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, and although he confessed to\r\nthree hundred and seventy murders within twenty-five years, he was\r\npardoned and absolved.\r\n\r\nLeaving Bologna, Montaigne hesitated in his choice of roads on account\r\nof brigands, and chose wisely for he was not molested. He crossed the\r\nApennines by a road, which he says is the first that could be called\r\nbad, and entered the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. One village on the way,\r\nstill in papal territory, was famous for the knavery of the innkeepers,\r\nwho made wonderful promises till the traveller was safely housed, and\r\nthen rendered the scantest performance. At the next village, which was\r\nin Tuscany, rival hosts rode out to meet the traveller, and struggled to\r\nsecure him, promising everything. One offered to serve a rabbit for\r\ndinner free, if Montaigne would lodge with him. The party prudently rode\r\nabout to all the inns on a tour of inspection, examining food and wine,\r\nand making their bargain before dismounting; the host, however, managed\r\nto put extras on the bill, it being impossible to remember beforehand\r\nevery item, wood, candles, linen, hay, etc.\r\n\r\nNext day Montaigne rode out of his way to see Pratolino, the Grand\r\nDuke's famous country place, with its gardens, alleys, wonderful\r\ngrottos, all decked with Nereids and Tritons, and fountains of\r\nextravagant baroque designs. From there he went on to\r\n\r\nFLORENCE, which appeared to him smaller than Ferrara. He went\r\nto see the ducal stables, the ducal menagerie, Michelangelo's statues,\r\nGiotto's campanile; and remarked that he had never seen a country with\r\nso few handsome women as Italy. Lodgings were inferior in comfort to\r\nthose in France, and the food was far less generous and less well served\r\nthan in Germany, where, also, sauces and seasonings were far superior;\r\nthe windows were big and always open, for there was no glass, and if the\r\nshutters were shut they excluded light and air as well as wind; the beds\r\nwere uncomfortable, the wines too sweet; moreover, Florence was esteemed\r\nthe most expensive city in Italy.\r\n\r\nMontaigne dined with the duke, Francesco I (son of Cosimo I), and his\r\nsecond wife, Bianca Cappello, the famous Venetian, who sat at the head\r\nof the table. She had a pleasant face, was reputed handsome, and seemed\r\nto have been able to keep her husband devoted to her for a long time.\r\nThe duke mixed water freely with his wine; she scarcely at all. After a\r\nbrief stay, during which he visited gardens and the environs of the\r\ncity, which he admired greatly, Montaigne rode southward to\r\n\r\nSIENA. The country was cultivated everywhere and tolerably\r\nfertile, but the road was rough and stony. At Siena he notes the Duomo,\r\nthe palaces, the _piazza_, the fountains, and, important point, that\r\n\"there are good cellars and fresh;\" also, that in Tuscany the city walls\r\nare let go to ruin, while the citadels are carefully fortified and no\r\none is permitted to go near, showing that the duke feared domestic\r\ninsurrection more than foreign attack. He observes \"the French are kept\r\nin such affectionate remembrance here by the people of the country, that\r\nat any mention of them tears well up in their eyes, for war itself, with\r\nfreedom in some form, seems to them sweeter than the peace which they\r\nenjoy under this tyranny.\" The French had aided Siena in its brave\r\nstruggle for liberty, and a valiant remnant of French and Sienese had\r\nheld out till the Peace of Cateau-Cambresis (1559), when France\r\nabandoned them to Cosimo dei Medici.\r\n\r\nFrom Siena he rode southward past Bolsena, Viterbo, and a pleasant\r\nvalley surrounded by hills covered with wood, \"a commodity somewhat rare\r\nin this country.\" Incidentally he commends the customs: in good houses\r\ndinner was served at two o'clock and supper at nine; and if there was a\r\nplay, it began at six and was over by supper time. \"It is a good country\r\nfor a lazy fellow for they get up late.\"\r\n\r\nAt ROME he put up for a day at the _Bear_, and then took\r\nlodgings, three good bedrooms, parlour, dining-room, kitchen, and\r\nstable, for twenty crowns a month, the host providing the cook and fire\r\nfor the kitchen. \"Apartments are ordinarily somewhat better furnished\r\nthan in Paris, especially as they have a great deal of gilt leather,\r\nwith which the walls of apartments of a certain grade are hung.\" He\r\nmight have hired another apartment for the same price, furnished in silk\r\nand cloth of gold, but he did not think this luxury suitable, and the\r\nrooms were not so convenient. Ancient Rome impressed him immensely, and\r\nthe modern city, too; he was astonished by the papal court, the number\r\nof prelates, the crowd of ecclesiasts, by the streets, so full of richly\r\ndressed men, of horses and coaches.\r\n\r\nMaking a comparison between freedom in Venice and in Rome, he argued for\r\nVenice, and adduced these reasons: \"Item, that in Rome houses were so\r\ninsecure, that those who had considerable sums of money were advised to\r\nleave their purses at their bankers, so as not to find their chest\r\nbroken open; item, that it was not very safe to go out at night; item,\r\nthat, in the very first month of his visit, the General of the\r\nCordeliers was abruptly dismissed from his post and put in prison,\r\nbecause in a sermon, which he preached before the Pope [Gregory XIII]\r\nand the cardinals, he had accused prelates of laziness and luxury, but\r\nwithout going into details, and using (with some asperity of voice) only\r\nperfectly common and current phrases on the subject; item, that his\r\nluggage had been examined on entering the city for the customs, and had\r\nbeen ransacked down to the smallest article of clothing, whereas in most\r\nof the other cities in Italy the officials had been satisfied with the\r\nmere offer to submit to examination; besides that, they had taken all\r\nthe books they found in order to examine them, and took so long about\r\nit, that a man who had something to do might put them down as lost; add\r\nto that, that their rules were so extraordinary that the 'Book of Hours\r\nof Our Lady' fell under their suspicion, because it came from Paris and\r\nnot from Rome, and they also kept books, written by some German doctors\r\nagainst heretics, because in combating them they made mention of their\r\nerrors.\"\r\n\r\nOn Christmas day at St. Peter's during mass, Montaigne \"was surprised to\r\nsee Pope, cardinals, and other prelates, seated almost all through the\r\nmass, talking and conversing together. The ceremony seemed more\r\nmagnificent than devotional.\" He obtained an interview with the Pope,\r\nvery ceremonious; and dined with a French cardinal, where the\r\n_benedicite_ and repetitions of grace, very long, were recited\r\nantiphonally by two chaplains. During dinner the Bible was read, and\r\nafter the table was cleared, service was held; everything was\r\nexceedingly formal, but the _chef_ does not appear to have equalled\r\nCardinal Caraffa's _chef_, a culinary enthusiast, with whom Montaigne\r\nhad a long talk on sauces, soups, and serving. Montaigne attended the\r\nCarnival sports on the Corso, a festival already at that time more than\r\na hundred years old, where boys, Jews, old men, horses, asses, and\r\nbuffalo ran races; fair ladies, without masks, looked on, and young\r\ncavaliers congregated where the ladies could see them; the ladies were\r\nrichly clad, the gentlemen simply; and (Montaigne adds) the appearance\r\nof the dukes, counts, and marquesses was not equal to their titles.\r\n\r\nMontaigne's \"Essays\" had been submitted to the Master of the Palace, who\r\nexamined them with the aid of a French friar, for the Master knew no\r\nFrench. After a delay they were returned, and the Master left it to\r\nMontaigne's conscience to alter what might seem to be in bad taste,\r\nespecially in those points to which the French friar objected; item,\r\nthat Montaigne had used the word _Fortune_; item, that he had named\r\npoets who were heretics; item, that he had made an apology for Julian\r\nthe Apostate; item, that he had suggested that when a man was saying his\r\nprayers he ought at that moment to be free from any unworthy\r\ninclination; item, that he judged any punishment in excess of death,\r\ncruelty; item, that a child should be educated to do all sorts of\r\nthings, etc. Another book belonging to Montaigne, a history of the\r\nSwiss, was confiscated, because the translator was a heretic.\r\n\r\nOn Maundy Thursday he saw the Pope come forth on the balcony of St.\r\nPeter's attended by his cardinals. On one side a canon, speaking Latin;\r\non the other, a cardinal read, in Italian, a long bull which\r\nexcommunicated an everlasting list of people, including the Huguenots\r\nand all princes who withheld any portion of the territory of the Church.\r\nAt this last article Cardinals Medici and Caraffa laughed heartily. At\r\nnight there was a great procession of religious guilds, with twelve\r\nthousand torches, including files of Penitents, who scourged their bare\r\nbacks till the blood ran. Montaigne, however, was of opinion that these\r\nPenitents were hired for this purpose. He agreed with the French\r\nambassador, that the poor people were incomparably more devout in France\r\nthan here, but that in Rome the rich, and especially the courtiers, were\r\nmore devout than in France.\r\n\r\nFrom Rome Montaigne made his way northward by SPOLETO, where\r\nthere was great alarm caused by a noted brigand. On the way he notes his\r\nfood,--salt fish, beans uncooked, artichokes also uncooked, peas, green\r\nalmonds, eggs, cheese, wine, and, in little places, olive oil instead of\r\nbutter. \"You meet monks every now and then who give holy water to\r\ntravellers and expect alms in return, and a lot of children who beg and\r\nhold out their beads, promising to say a string of paternosters for the\r\nperson who will give them something.\"\r\n\r\nThe Umbrian plain was beautiful and fertile, with grains and fruits in\r\nabundance, the whole country rich beyond description. So, too, had been\r\nthe Roman Campagna, but that was not tenanted, for its owners, the Roman\r\nbarons, had let it to merchant farmers, who did not maintain peasants\r\nthere, but in harvest time hired husbandmen from all over Italy, to the\r\nnumber of forty thousand, to gather in the crops. From FOLIGNO he turned\r\nto the right and crossed the Apennines just below Assisi, and travelled\r\ntoward the Adriatic coast, making a pilgrimage to LORETO, a place like\r\nLourdes, celebrated for its miracles, and for the \"very same little\r\nhouse in which Jesus Christ was born in Nazareth.\" Here he found the\r\npeople much more religious than elsewhere; even the attendants in the\r\nChurch were ready to do anything, and would accept no tips. Thence he\r\nwent to ANCONA, SINIGAGLIA, URBINO, where he inspected the famous palace\r\nbegun by Federigo da Montefeltro; then back to FLORENCE, once more to\r\nadmire the beautiful villas which decked the hills round about, and on\r\nto PRATO and PISTOIA, stagnating little towns, whose civic life had been\r\ncrushed out by the Medici. So he rode on through lovely country, where\r\nlong lines of little trees, trellised with vines, divided the rich\r\nfields of grain, skirting the hills covered with olive, mulberry, and\r\nchestnut, till he reached LUCCA, which had saved itself from the clutch\r\nof the Medici by clinging to the skirts of Austria.\r\n\r\nLucca, girdled by fortifications worthy of a most martial ardour,\r\nmaintained a comfortable prosperity by the manufacture of silk; but\r\nhere, as elsewhere, it was becoming unfashionable to engage in trade,\r\npartly on account of decreasing returns and the general waning of\r\nenergy, and partly from Spanish influences. Gentlemen retired from\r\nbusiness, invested their money in landed estates, and were rapidly\r\ntending to become the characters which we find in Goldoni's comedies.\r\n\r\nFrom Lucca Montaigne went to the BATHS OF LUCCA and took the cure for\r\nnear two months. He found the country lovely, but society a little slow;\r\nmost of the men were apothecaries. After the cure he made another tour\r\nsouthward, then back to Lucca for more baths, from there northward, on\r\nthe road to Milan, stopping at PONTREMOLI. At the inn in this place, the\r\ndinner began with cheese _alla milanese_, included a dish of olives,\r\ntheir pits taken out, dressed with oil and vinegar _alla genovese_; on a\r\nbench stood one basin in which all the guests washed their hands in the\r\nsame water, _alla pontremolese_. From there he crossed the Apennines,\r\nwhere the mountaineers, horrid people, charged them most cruel prices,\r\nand went on into the duchy of Parma, where Alessandro Farnese, the great\r\ngeneral, was the reigning duke. At PIACENZA, the King of Spain, out of\r\nhis abundant caution, still maintained a Spanish garrison in the castle,\r\n\"badly paid as they told me.\" Thence they proceeded into the duchy of\r\nMilan.\r\n\r\nAt PAVIA Montaigne remarks, that from Rome northward the best\r\ninn he had lodged at was the _Post_ at Piacenza, and the worst the\r\n_Falcon_ at Pavia: \"You pay extra for wood, and there are no mattresses\r\non the beds.\" MILAN was the largest city in Italy, not unlike\r\nParis, full of merchandise and craftsmen; it lacked the palaces of other\r\ncities, but in size excelled them all, and in throng of people rivalled\r\nVenice.\r\n\r\nFrom Milan he rode westward, and entered the domains of the Duke of\r\nSavoy, crossing the Sesia near Vercelli, where the duke was building a\r\nfort in such haste, that he aroused the suspicion of his Spanish\r\nneighbours. Thence he went to TURIN. Here the people imitated\r\nFrench ways, looked up to Paris, usually spoke French, or rather French\r\nwords with Italian pronunciation, and altogether seemed very devoted to\r\nFrance. Montaigne liked Piedmont, finding the inns there better than\r\nelsewhere in Italy. The bread was bad but the wine good, there was\r\nplenty to eat, and the innkeepers were polite. He crossed the Alps over\r\nthe Mt. Cenis Pass, half the time on horseback, half the time in a\r\nchaise borne by four porters, and then entered Savoy proper, passing its\r\ncapital, Chamberi, crossing the Rhone to the north and then the little\r\nriver Ain to the westward, and came to MONTLUEL, the last town\r\nof Savoy, and so on to the Saone, Lyons, and French soil (November,\r\n1581).\r\n\r\nSuch was the Italy of the long period from 1580 to 1789, the land of\r\nolives, mulberries, and chestnuts, of fertile fields crossed by\r\nvine-laden trees, of irrigated plains and treeless mountains, of\r\ninnkeepers, good, bad, and indifferent, of Spanish garrisons, ducal\r\ncitadels, and dare-devil banditti, of begging urchins, perfuming friars,\r\nof gentlemen too genteel to work, of prelates in coaches, of antique\r\nruins and Renaissance glory, of blue sky and vivacious manners, in\r\nshort, almost the Italy that our fathers knew before the perturbations\r\nof 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF STAGNATION, POLITICS (1580-1789)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now reached a period of comparative stability in which dukes,\r\nviceroys, oligarchs, and Popes sit settled in their respective dominions\r\nwith a security that appears a little tame after the whir and uproar of\r\nBarbarian invasion. To be sure, the wars between Spain, France, and\r\nAustria, waged first to abate the over-greatness of the House of\r\nHapsburg and afterwards that of the House of Bourbon, were often fought\r\nout in the north of Italy; nevertheless, the period of confusion has\r\npassed, and each principality has a consecutive political history, which\r\nruns along for two hundred years. Our best course will be to glance at\r\nthe careers of the several states, one by one, until they reach the\r\ntumultuous influences of the French Revolution. Venice, the noblest as\r\nwell as the most powerful, deserves to come first.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Venice_\r\n\r\nVenice still ranked as one of the great powers of Europe; she was sought\r\nas an ally, she took part in European counsels, and bore herself with\r\nresolute dignity and pride. The change that was going on went on so\r\nslowly, and her statesmen were so well trained and so far-sighted, that\r\nher reputation remained intact after the power which had created it had\r\nshrunk and dwindled. In spite of the battle of Lepanto she lost the\r\nisland of Cyprus to the Turks, but secured a peace which lasted for two\r\ngenerations, a surprisingly long time, considering that the two states\r\nwere destined to fight each other till both were exhausted. She was less\r\nsuccessful in keeping at peace with her Christian neighbours, and became\r\nembroiled in a celebrated quarrel with the Holy See.\r\n\r\nThere was an irritating papal bull which was issued and reissued under\r\nthe stimulus of the reinvigorating Counter-Reformation, entitled _In\r\nCoena Domini_ (for the Lord's Supper), usually read on Maundy Thursday.\r\nIt was probably the very bull that Montaigne heard read from the balcony\r\nof St. Peter's. This bull asserted papal claims of extreme character,\r\nnot unworthy of Boniface VIII, and, in fact, revealed complete\r\nconsciousness of renewed youth and vitality. Other states in Italy bowed\r\nand accepted, or pretended to accept, this declaration of papal\r\nauthority; but Venice refused to publish the bull. In fact, though\r\nVenice had always professed great respect for the Holy See, she had been\r\nconsistently self-willed and opposed to papal pretensions, and likewise\r\nsomewhat free-thinking. Moreover, there had been festering disagreements\r\nconcerning territory and politics. Venice insisted upon the right to tax\r\nChurch property within the state, and to try priests charged with crime\r\nbefore her lay tribunals. Acting upon the latter right she arrested and\r\ntried two priests guilty of crime. This action traversed the doctrine\r\nlaid down in the papal bull. The Pope put Venice under an interdict\r\n(1606). In retaliation the Signory issued a decree of banishment against\r\nall priests and monks who should obey the interdict. Various Orders\r\nquitted the city. The Pope stood firm in his position that \"there could\r\nbe no true piety without entire submission to the spiritual power.\" All\r\nEurope looked on, the Protestants backing Venice, the Catholics\r\nsupporting the Pope. War was in the air; but the danger of a European\r\n_melee_ was too great. The French King, Henry IV, enacted the\r\npeacemaker; and the forces in favour of compromise succeeded in\r\nreestablishing peace.\r\n\r\nOut of the quarrel one man issued with a noble historic reputation. Fra\r\nPaolo Sarpi (1552-1623) was the last of the great Venetians. In boyhood\r\nhe was so precocious a scholar that at eighteen he was made professor of\r\nPositive Theology, and, a little later, of Philosophy and of\r\nMathematics. Grown up, he became a man of science, the foremost of his\r\ntime excepting Francis Bacon. He discovered the valves of the veins, and\r\nalso, independently of Harvey, the circulation of the blood. He made\r\ndiscoveries in optics. He studied heat, light, sound, colour,\r\npneumatics, the magnetic needle. In astronomy Galileo called him, \"_il\r\nmio padre e maestro_--my father and my master.\" Sir Henry Wotton, the\r\nEnglish ambassador to Venice, said, Fra Paolo is \"as expert in the\r\nhistory of plants as if he had never perused any book but Nature.\" In\r\naddition to these achievements, he wrote a very celebrated history of\r\nthe Council of Trent. At the time of the breach with the Papacy, this\r\nbrilliant savant was appointed Theological Counsellor to the Republic,\r\nand was abruptly flung into the confusion and passion of violent\r\npolitical strife. Deeply patriotic,--his last thought was for Venice,\r\n\"_Esto perpetua_, may she live forever,\"--he held a brief, as it were,\r\nfor his country, and as her advocate argued her cause before all Europe\r\nwith brilliant success.\r\n\r\nAt this period the Venetian Signory belonged, in spirit at least, to an\r\ninternational political party which was opposed to Spain and to the\r\nPapacy, and for that reason was favoured by the French, especially when\r\nHenry of Navarre was on the throne. In fact, this quarrel between Venice\r\nand the Papacy may be considered an episode in the great struggle\r\nbetween the party of European freedom and the tyrannical House of\r\nHapsburg, seated on the thrones of Spain and Austria, and supported by\r\nthe Papacy.\r\n\r\nBut Venice was not able to concentrate her attention upon European\r\naffairs. Later in the century war with the Turks was renewed; she was\r\ntoo weak to resist them single-handed, and, after a struggle which\r\nlasted for twenty-five years, she lost Crete (1669). Not many years\r\nlater, having obtained allies, she renewed the war, fought with great\r\ngallantry, and actually conquered the Morea, which, on the conclusion of\r\nhostilities, was ceded to her (1699). This conquest, now best remembered\r\nfrom the fact that in the attack on Athens a Venetian bomb blew up the\r\nParthenon, was the last great military exploit of the Venetians, and\r\nwithin twenty years the Morea was lost again.\r\n\r\nMartial vigour ebbed slowly but surely. During the war of the Spanish\r\nSuccession, when, the course of fortune having shifted, Europe combined\r\nto resist the overbearing power of Louis XIV and the House of Bourbon,\r\nVenice remained neutral. Like an old dog which has fought many good\r\nfights in its youth and prime, and now, lame and scarred, maintains a\r\ndignified abstention from canine frays, Venice lay back. In 1718, after\r\nthe war with Turkey in which she lost the Morea, she took part in the\r\ntreaty between Austria and Turkey. This was her last active diplomatic\r\nintervention in the affairs of Europe. She had lost Cyprus, Crete, the\r\nMorea; and now her province in Italy, bits of Illyria, and some of the\r\nIonian Islands, alone remained from her old empire. She shut her eyes to\r\nthe past, and concentrated her attention on making her beautiful city\r\n\"the revel of the earth, the masque of Italy.\" On the eve of the mighty\r\nupheaval of the French Revolution, her old sea glory flashed up under\r\nher last great admiral, Angelo Emo (1731-92), who cleared the seas of\r\nthe Algerine pirates; but it was too late, Venice had run her course,\r\nand the end was at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spanish Provinces_\r\n\r\nWest of Venetian territory, the unfortunate duchy of Milan fulfilled its\r\nmelancholy lot of being the prize possessed by Spain, yet coveted and\r\nfought for by France. Its history takes no special hold upon the memory.\r\nAgainst a constant background of French ambition (Richelieu, Mazarin,\r\nLouis XIV), the Spanish governors step forward upon the Milanese stage,\r\nlevy taxes, scheme how to circumvent the French, and how to extend\r\nSpanish dominion, and then go home, a little richer but without leaving\r\nany definite impression on the page of history except as they have\r\nserved to create the scenes depicted in the romantic novel \"I Promessi\r\nSposi.\" One has a vague idea of ceremony, bows, obeisances, ignorance,\r\nrapacity, and cruelty, but the idea is nebulous, and we need not stop.\r\n\r\nLeaving local affairs aside, we will proceed at once to see how the\r\ntitles to Milan and other Spanish provinces in Italy passed from Spain\r\ninto other hands. History here acts as an attorney and coldly records\r\nthe transfer from one monarch to another. Like lots of land the\r\nprovinces of Italy were bartered and granted in consideration of war,\r\ndynastic love, and affection, or for the sake of the political\r\nequilibrium of Europe. The great Powers fell to blows over the\r\nsuccession to the crown of Spain (1700-14), to the crown of Poland\r\n(1733-35), and other matters in which Italy had no voluntary concern;\r\nand, after years of war, made treaties to reestablish European\r\nequilibrium by an elaborate system of weights and counterweights. Where\r\nthe balances hung unevenly, a province of Italy was thrown in to restore\r\nthem to a level. In this way Milan, Parma, Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia\r\nwere disposed of. All we need do is to remember that in place of\r\nconveyances there were treaties, and in place of offer, counter-offer,\r\nhaggling, and bargaining, there were battles, sieges, devastation, and\r\npillage.\r\n\r\nThe records of conveyances in the office of history read as follows:--\r\n\r\n LOT        GRANTOR           GRANTEE             DATE\r\n\r\n Milan      Spain             Austria             1713\r\n\r\n Naples     Spain             Austria             1713\r\n   \"        Austria           Spanish Bourbons    1738\r\n\r\n Sicily     Spain             Savoy               1713\r\n   \"        Savoy             Austria             1720\r\n   \"        Austria           Spanish Bourbons    1738\r\n\r\n Parma      Spanish Bourbons  Austria             1738\r\n   \"        Austria           Spanish Bourbons    1748\r\n\r\n Sardinia   Spain             Austria             1713\r\n    \"       Austria           Savoy               1720\r\n\r\nMilan was subject to only one transfer, from Spain to Austria, by the\r\ntreaties of Utrecht and Rastadt (1713-14), which closed the war of the\r\nSpanish Succession. Those same treaties took Naples and the island of\r\nSardinia from Spain and gave them to Austria, and also took Sicily from\r\nSpain and gave it to Savoy. Spain, however, was dissatisfied, and\r\nattempted to recover what she had lost; but a new European coalition\r\nforced her to renounce her claim. In the general pacification after the\r\nwar, for the purpose of making a more satisfactory arrangement, Sardinia\r\nwas exchanged for Sicily, giving Sardinia to Savoy and Sicily to Austria\r\n(1720). Finally, after the war of the Polish Succession by the Peace of\r\nVienna (1738), Austria ceded Naples and Sicily to younger sons of the\r\nroyal family of Spain, the Spanish Bourbons, on condition that those\r\nprovinces should never be united with the crown of Spain, and received\r\nin exchange the little duchy of Parma, which had fallen to a Spanish\r\nBourbon on the extinction of the Farnesi. But ten years later, at the\r\nclose of the war of the Austrian Succession, Austria ceded Parma back\r\nagain to other members of the Spanish Bourbon family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tuscany_\r\n\r\nAnother paragraph is necessary to complete the Austrification and the\r\nSpanification of Italy. The Medici of Tuscany died out. After the first\r\nGrand Duke, Cosimo, six successors had followed, dwindling away in\r\nincapacity, luxury, and bigotry. The last died in 1737. Then, by virtue\r\nof that general reapportionment after the war of the Polish Succession,\r\nthe Grand Duchy was handed over to the Duke of Lorraine, husband of\r\nMaria Theresa, of the House of Hapsburg, Empress of Austria, and became\r\nan appanage of the Austrian Empire, under the rule of the younger sons\r\nof the Imperial house. It is a relief to turn from these Austrian and\r\nSpanish provinces to the two living powers, Savoy and the Papacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Savoy_\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to chronicle here the history of the Savoyard\r\ndukes, who were advanced to the title of Kings of Sardinia after the\r\nacquisition of that island. Savoy lay in the way of the three fighting\r\nnations, France, Spain, and Austria. The plain of Piedmont was an\r\nadmirable fighting-ground, and the combatants chose it on all possible\r\noccasions, but it would not be fair to charge the whole blame upon those\r\nthree nations. The Dukes of Savoy were ambitious men, full of all sorts\r\nof schemes for increasing their dominions and their personal glory.\r\nWhenever any one of them thought he perceived an opportunity to seize\r\nsome neighbouring territory, he caught at it, reckless of collision with\r\nhis powerful neighbours. The general upshot was that Savoy lost its old\r\nSwiss provinces and its old French provinces, and that Piedmont became\r\nthe head and front of the new Kingdom of Sardinia. Equally important to\r\nItaly was the fact that, while the people of the other Italian provinces\r\nbecame more and more incapable of bearing arms or of making any real\r\nmartial effort, the people of Piedmont gradually became a nation of\r\nsoldiers. In devastation, war, and apparent ruin, Piedmontese valour and\r\nPiedmontese character were trained and developed, and Piedmont little by\r\nlittle came to feel, and likewise to impress upon the other Italian\r\nStates, that she, and she alone, was the refuge and hope of whatever\r\nItalian patriotism might still exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Papacy_\r\n\r\nThe Papacy we left at the end of the sixteenth century in the full flood\r\nof revival. The Popes were swept on by the tide. The bold and successful\r\nfront opposed to the enemy was supplemented by discipline within. Heresy\r\nwas traced and tracked. Inquisitors roamed about, spying what they\r\nmight; they frightened the learned from publishing, printers from\r\nprinting, and almost all from freedom of talk and thought. Thus traitors\r\nwere rooted out. And at the same time faithful soldiers of the Church\r\nwere trained and educated. Seminaries for priests of divers nations were\r\nfounded in Rome; Jesuit schools were helped everywhere. Sixtus V (Felice\r\nPeretti), 1585-90, was a Pope worthy of the great period. He entertained\r\na plan to reconquer Egypt, and make the Mediterranean and Red Seas a\r\nhigh-road for armies and navies that should break up the Ottoman power.\r\nHe attacked the banditti of the Papal State, as his predecessors had\r\nattacked the barons, and, for a time at least, suppressed them. He was a\r\ngreat builder; he completed the dome of St. Peter's, set up the Egyptian\r\nobelisk in the _piazza_ before the cathedral, substituted statues of St.\r\nPeter and St. Paul in place of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius on the tops of\r\nthe two great bronze columns that adorn the Foro Trajano and the Piazza\r\nColonna. He brought fresh water, named after him Acqua Felice, into the\r\ncity from over twenty miles away, and gave Rome an aspect worthy of the\r\ncapital of the Latin world. He fixed seventy for the number of\r\ncardinals; he revised the Vulgate; and pondered many great designs, for\r\nwhich, as he said, his strength would have been inadequate, even had he\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nBut these Popes of the Revival, who carried into effect the papal\r\nprinciples of the Council of Trent, vigorous, and in many respects\r\nadmirable, as they were, need not detain us, for the history of the\r\nPapacy in this period scarcely belongs to Italy. It has a far wider\r\nreach, and is intimately bound up with the great Catholic, one might say\r\nthe great Latin, effort to restore or extend Catholicism and Latin\r\nsupremacy throughout the world. In the British Isles, in Scandinavia, in\r\nPoland, in Russia, in Germany, Austria, France, and Switzerland, the\r\nChurch fought with the old Roman spirit of conquest. Everywhere the\r\nJesuit fathers went, busy, devoted, heroic. The ardour of St. Francis\r\nXavier, the self-abnegation of St. Francis de Sales, the passionate\r\nmysticism of St. Theresa, infected and controlled thousands of\r\ndisciples. Everywhere were great manifestations of activity. In South\r\nAmerica there were bishops and archbishops, hundreds of monasteries and\r\ninnumerable priests. In Mexico there were schools of theology. In India,\r\nthousands and thousands of converts clustered around the city of Goa. In\r\nChina and Japan the Jesuits built churches, and converted to\r\nChristianity disciples of Confucius and Buddha. The Church had founded\r\nan empire on which the sun never set. But our business is not with this\r\ngreat Latin conquest, this great Catholic revival. We must pass on to\r\nthe next series of Popes, less memorable for their imitation of Scipio\r\nand Caesar, than of Lucullus and Crassus. Here we find the names of the\r\nfounders of great papal families, so familiar in Rome, not as\r\nmissionaries, teachers, or martyrs, but as owners of palaces, villas,\r\npictures and statues: Borghese (Paul V, 1605-21), the Pope who\r\nquarrelled with the Venetian Republic; Ludovisi (Gregory XV, 1621-23),\r\nin whose pontificate the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide (College for\r\nPropagating the Faith) was established; Barberini (Urban VIII, 1623-44),\r\nwhose family, famous from the squib \"Quod non fecerunt Barbari fecerunt\r\nBarberini,\" built its palaces out of Roman ruins. During the pontificate\r\nof Barberini, Galileo was brought before the Holy Office, and his\r\nopinion that the earth moved condemned as \"absurd, false in philosophy,\r\nand essentially heretical.\"\r\n\r\nUnder his successor Panfili (Innocent X, 1644-55), Catholic Europe\r\nstopped fighting Protestant Europe, and the Thirty Years' War was closed\r\nby the Peace of Westphalia (1648). The Catholic Powers gave over the\r\nattempt to reduce the Protestant States, and acknowledged their\r\nindependence. Panfili launched his bull against the treaty, but the\r\nweary world disregarded the old man's curses. After him came Chigi\r\n(Alexander VII, 1655-67), Rospigliosi (Clement IX, 1667-69), Odescalchi\r\n(Innocent XI, 1676-89), whose names mean little to us.\r\n\r\nLong before this time the forces of revivification which had borne\r\nonward and upward the Catholic counter-charge on the Protestant ranks,\r\nhad begun to fall away. The great Catholic monarchs of Europe turned\r\ntheir minds to personal ambitions; the Popes squandered papal revenues\r\non their own families; the Jesuits loosened their rigid hold on their\r\nonce high principles. The period of reform had passed, and the Papacy\r\nsettled down into a policy of maintaining the ecclesiastical empire left\r\nto it and of enjoying its little Italian monarchy. In politics it\r\npursued a shifting course towards Austria, Spain, and France, dictated\r\nrather by passing fears than by wisdom or lofty ambition. At the time of\r\nthe close of the war of the Spanish Succession the Papacy was hardly\r\nregarded as a European power. The proof of decline was most visible in\r\nthe concessions made by the Papacy to the Catholic sovereigns, by its\r\nforced acquiescence in the repeated attacks on the Jesuits, and finally,\r\nby its bull suppressing, or rather attempting to suppress, the Order\r\n(1773).\r\n\r\nThroughout the eighteenth century the papal part in European affairs was\r\ninsignificant; and in Italy the general effects of papal rule were\r\nsteadily increasing poverty, superstition, and incompetence. It is a\r\nrelief to turn away, knowing that the French Revolution is blowing its\r\nrefreshing blasts ahead of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF STAGNATION, THE ARTS (1580-1789)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe should do wrong to leave these centuries to stand solely on their\r\npolitical record. Even this dreary period has contributed not a little\r\nto the sum of Italy's attractions. After the moral vigour of republican\r\nFlorence, after the freshness of the Renaissance and its later grandeur,\r\nafter the elegance of the courts of Urbino, Ferrara, and Milan, it\r\nrequires time to adjust ourselves to a different standard and to acquire\r\na relish for this period of dissipated little kings and dukes. But once\r\nfamiliar with the altered standard of excellence, these centuries, with\r\ntheir arts, their habits, their idleness, become exceedingly\r\nsympathetic, and lure with peculiar dexterity the idler who seeks\r\nentertainment and the picturesque. Not that there is no serious element\r\nin them, for there is. Italy, though known to us through her lovers as a\r\nwoman land, has always happily commingled feminine charm and masculine\r\nstrength. Like the Apennines which stretch their grim strength from the\r\nAlps to the toe of the peninsula, virility runs throughout the length of\r\nItalian history, though at times it avoids notice. In this period it is\r\nbest represented by science; and we must not omit to mention a few of\r\nthe most distinguished scientific thinkers.\r\n\r\nGiordano Bruno (1550-1600) and Campanella (1568-1639) were philosophers\r\nrather than men of science; their philosophy ran counter to the\r\nscholastic philosophy sanctioned by the Church, and they came into\r\ncollision with the stern spirit of the Catholic Reaction. Campanella was\r\npersecuted and punished; Bruno was condemned as a heretic and burnt to\r\ndeath in the city of Rome. Greater than either was Galileo (1564-1642),\r\nwhose name is one of the most illustrious in astronomy. He was born at\r\nPisa, where he was educated in the university. He devoted himself to\r\nstudy, especially to mathematics, and became a professor. In 1609 he\r\nheard that a Dutchman had made an instrument which in some way by means\r\nof a lens magnified objects. Acting on this hint he constructed a\r\ntelescope; and, if not strictly the inventor, he was the first to use\r\nthe telescope in astronomy. The next year he made various eventful\r\ndiscoveries: that there are mountains in the moon, and spots on the sun;\r\nthat Venus has phases; that Saturn has an appendage, which later was\r\nproved to be rings; that Jupiter has four satellites, a discovery which\r\nincreased the number of heavenly bodies from the mystically sacred seven\r\n(sun, moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn) to the\r\nuninspiring eleven. These discoveries persuaded Galileo to adopt the\r\nCopernican theory, and brought him into collision with the Church. Much\r\nhas been said about his cruel persecution, but he appears to have\r\nreceived gentle treatment and to have undergone a merely nominal\r\nimprisonment. Another philosopher, Vico (1668-1744), a Neapolitan,\r\nenjoys a very high reputation in Italy as a thinker. He wrote a\r\nphilosophy of history, in which he investigated the laws that govern\r\nhuman progress, showed that philosophical theories must treat mankind\r\ncollectively, and anticipated Comte's theory of the three stages of\r\nsocial development.\r\n\r\nScience is not the characteristic trait of this period; for that is to\r\nbe found in the arts or in the pleasant enervating lassitude of life. In\r\nthe grand-ducal atmosphere there is a sense of having browsed on\r\nlotus-flowers. As we glance back on the great centuries, their efforts\r\nlook splendid, their high purposes noble, their infinite curiosity\r\ncommendable, but we are content to sit in a ducal garden, to listen to\r\nthe Tritons spout into the fountains, to sip chocolate, to meditate\r\nsonnets to a partner for the minuet, to gossip about \"His Highness and\r\nContessa B----, who, so that young _milord_, Horry Walpole, says, was\r\nonce a ballerina,\" and to confess our sins to fat, amiable priests. We\r\nenjoy the badinage of the abbes, the ingenious vacuity of the\r\nlitterateurs, the cheerful buzz of the cafe, the daily saunter on the\r\nfashionable promenade, the drive in the park, and all the details of\r\ntheatrical make-believe existence.\r\n\r\nAs one becomes used to this lotos-laden atmosphere, one gets lenient\r\nimpressions of the arts, of their peculiar and characteristic\r\nagreeableness, and rapidly loses one's previous too scornfully classical\r\nattitude. In an earlier chapter we indulged in some high-flown\r\ndenunciation of the Baroque in architecture. That was because we were\r\nfresh from the Renaissance. Now that we have eaten of the lotos, we\r\nrefrain from comparison and enjoy the arts in their new phases, in and\r\nfor themselves. There is hardly an Italian city that would not be poorer\r\nfor the absence of the Baroque. Rome, for instance, owes most of its\r\ncharm to these decadent generations, to the Villa Medici, the Villa\r\nBorghese, the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain, the Piazza Navona.\r\n\r\nA Neapolitan, Bernini (1598-1680), was the master spirit of the best\r\nBaroque, both in architecture and in sculpture. His greatest achievement\r\nis the splendid colonnade which reaches out like two arms from St.\r\nPeter's Church and clasps the sunny _piazza_ in its embrace (1667).\r\nBernini's statues, his fountains, his decorations and ornaments, make a\r\ngood history of the time. They undoubtedly reveal decadence, yet they\r\nare respectfully imitative of the great achievements of the Renaissance,\r\nwhereas the works of his numerous disciples are surcharged with\r\ncontortion, obvious effort, and strain for effect. There is a maximum of\r\nvisible exertion with a minimum of real accomplishment. Details are\r\nmultiplied, and ornaments bear little or no relation to the organic\r\nstructure of the buildings which they adorn; yet that practice is an\r\nItalian trait, and even in excess has a picturesque merit. The baser\r\nwork of this style, exhibited in the vainglorious churches of the\r\nJesuits, is sometimes called the Jesuit style. After this period of\r\nstormy ornament came a calm in the eighteenth century, facades became\r\nrectilinear, and there was a general subsidence of obvious effort.\r\n\r\nIn painting the school of Bologna, led by Lodovico Caracci (1555-1619)\r\nand his nephews, Agostino and the more noted and gifted Annibale, set\r\nthe fashion. They endeavoured to combine faithfulness to nature with all\r\nthe merits of all their predecessors, and are therefore called the\r\neclectic school. They remained the cynosure of touring eyes until the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century. Sir Joshua Reynolds admired and\r\npraised them. Some of their disciples were for a long time almost as\r\nfamous as Raphael. Domenichino's Last Communion of St. Jerome held a\r\nplace of honour in the Vatican Gallery equal to Raphael's\r\nTransfiguration. Guido Reni's Aurora, painted on the ceiling of the\r\ncasino in the Rospigliosi palace in Rome, had a tremendous vogue, and\r\neven now tourists, escaped from the critics, admire it privily.\r\nGuercino, Sassoferrato, and also the lachrymose Carlo Dolci are other\r\ncelebrated members of the school. Another school, almost equally famous,\r\nwas devoted to Naturalism,--imitation of starving old beggars and a\r\ngeneral depiction of want, misery, and squalor. Of these painters the\r\nprincipal were Caravaggio (1569-1609), a Neapolitan, and his pupil\r\nRibera, known as _Lo Spagnoletto_, because he was born in Spain. A later\r\ngroup, the Venetians of the eighteenth century, consisted of Canaletto,\r\nBellotto, Guardi, and others who painted again and again the idle canals\r\nand pleasure-loving palaces of Venice. The greatest of this group was\r\nTiepolo (1693-1770), who attained in a measure the grand manner of the\r\ngreat masters of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn literature, though that also had flashes of seriousness, as in\r\nFilicaia's celebrated sonnet to Italy adapted by Lord Byron,--\r\n\r\n    Italia! O Italia! thou who hast\r\n    The fatal gift of beauty--\r\n\r\nthe spirit of the Baroque, in its lightest and pleasantest manner,\r\nexpressed itself to the full by means of the Academy of Arcadia. The\r\nunreality of the whole Italian world was concentrated in this Academy,\r\nwhich soon had branches, imitations, colonies all over the peninsula. It\r\nwas founded in Rome (1692) by Gravina, a jurist, Crescimbeni, a priest,\r\nand other dilettanti, for the ennoblement of literature, the\r\npurification of taste, and other meritorious purposes. The members\r\ncalled themselves Arcadian shepherds and shepherdesses, took pastoral\r\nnames, composed sonnets by the bushel, wrote one another's biographies,\r\nand were altogether delightfully silly. Goldoni, the playwright, gives a\r\nglimpse of these litterateurs in the eighteenth century as he observed\r\nthem in Pisa.\r\n\r\nOne day he passed a garden gate and saw within the garden a crowd of\r\nladies and gentlemen grouped by an arbour. He was told, \"The assembly\r\nwhich you see is a colony of the Arcadia of Rome, called the Colony of\r\nAlpheus, named after a very celebrated river in Greece, which flowed\r\nthrough the ancient Pisa in Elis.\" Goldoni went up to the circle and\r\nlistened to a number of gentlemen who recited poems, canzoni, ballads,\r\nsonnets, etc. He observed that the company looked at him as if desirous\r\nto know who he was. Eager to satisfy their curiosity, he asked the\r\npresident if a stranger might be permitted to express in poetry the\r\nsatisfaction which he experienced in being present on so interesting an\r\noccasion. Goldoni had a sonnet in his head, composed by him in his youth\r\nfor some similar festival; he hastily changed a few words to adapt it to\r\nthe present occasion, and recited the fourteen lines with the tone and\r\ninflection of voice which set off sentiment and rhyme to the best\r\nadvantage. The sonnet had all the appearance of being extemporaneous,\r\nand was very much applauded. Whether the meeting had come to its\r\nappointed end or not he did not know, but everybody got up and crowded\r\nabout him. Thereupon he was introduced to a whole troop of Arcadian\r\nshepherds, who welcomed him most heartily. At another meeting the\r\npresident, whose proper title was Guardian of the Shepherds, drew a\r\nlarge packet from his pocket, and presented Goldoni with two documents,\r\na certificate of his membership in the Arcadia of Rome under the name of\r\nPolisseno (Polixenes), and a legal deed which bestowed upon him the\r\nFegean Fields in Greece; whereupon the whole assembly saluted him under\r\nthe name of Polixenes Fegeus, and embraced him as a fellow shepherd.\r\nGoldoni says that, in spite of the formality of the conveyance, the\r\nTurks never acknowledged his title.\r\n\r\nMention of the Arcadia and of Goldoni leads to another art, most\r\ncharacteristic of these two centuries, the player's art. The drama had\r\nnever been a success in Italy; Machiavelli and Ariosto wrote comedies,\r\nbut they were no better from a dramatic than from an ethical point of\r\nview. After the acknowledged failure of serious comedy, another species\r\ntook the field, the \"Commedia dell'Arte,\" and definitely established\r\nitself at about the time of the beginning of the Baroque. In this\r\nspecies of comedy the dramatis personae were masked and always\r\nimpersonated certain definite characters, and the dialogue was\r\nimprovised. These masks were _Pantalone_, our Pantaloon, a Venetian\r\nmerchant, who always wore a black robe and scarlet stockings, and spoke\r\nthe Venetian dialect; _Il Dottore_, the doctor, a pompous ass from\r\nBologna; _Arlecchino_, Harlequin, a silly and credulous servant in tight\r\nhose and motley jerkin, and _Brighella_, a quick-witted and knavish\r\nservant, both speaking the patois of Bergamo; _Colombina_, the\r\nsoubrette, a pretty maid-servant from Tuscany; _Capitano Spavento_,\r\nCaptain Terrible, a fire-eater from Naples, etc. This comedy,\r\nnecessarily kept within narrow limits by these characters, was strictly\r\nimprovisation, except that the playwright provided a _scenario_, a\r\nskeleton plot. It had great success, and troops of Italian comedians\r\nwent all over Europe; but by the eighteenth century it had run its\r\ncourse and become mere vulgar horseplay, and Goldoni (1707-93), the only\r\nbrilliant comic playwright that Italy has produced, gave it a\r\ndeath-blow.\r\n\r\nGoldoni was a Venetian, and a perfect embodiment of the happy, careless,\r\namiable, entertaining society of the time. He led a roaming life, going\r\nto Tuscany to learn good Italian, and finally ending his career with\r\ntwenty years in Paris. Some of his plays are in the Venetian dialect;\r\ntwo were written in French. There are more than a hundred, counting\r\ntragedies, interludes, and all. Their virtue is their lightness. They\r\nare made of foam, a delicious dramatic _souffle_, and in the hands of\r\naccomplished Italian actors, like Eleonora Duse or Ermete Novelli,\r\nretain their charm to this day. They are essential for the history of\r\nthe period, with their counts, barons, marquesses, their ladies, their\r\nwaiting-maids, their innkeepers, _camerieri_, cobblers, adventurers, and\r\nall their gay mockery of the idle habits of the time.\r\n\r\nIt will throw a little more light upon the customs of that day to\r\nmention _cicisbeismo_, an unwritten rule of an artificial and idle\r\nsociety, which prescribed that a lady should have a _cavaliere\r\nservente_, a gentleman dangling in attendance upon her. Every lady had a\r\nhusband, as maidens were not allowed in society, and widows had to\r\nchoose between a convent and a second marriage; but the husband could\r\nnot wait upon her, for his own duty as _cavaliere servente_ required him\r\nto be in attendance upon somebody else's wife. The duties of the\r\n_cavaliere servente_ were to devote himself solely to his lady, to write\r\n_billets-doux_, compose sonnets to her lapdog, to hand her chocolate at\r\n_conversazioni_, to give her his arm on all occasions, to ride beside\r\nher coach when she was out driving, and so on. In fact, he was required\r\nto do all those little offices, _petits soins_, which a young gentleman\r\nis accustomed to render to the lady whom he is engaged to marry. It was\r\na state of active flirtation, not only sanctioned but required by\r\nsociety. It is said that in some cases the _cavaliere servente_ was\r\nagreed upon before marriage, and his name inserted in the marriage\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nBesides Goldoni's comic drama and the \"Commedia dell'Arte\" this Baroque\r\nItaly gave the world another and far more important gift, the Opera.\r\nItalian genius flared up once more and led the world in music. As far\r\nback as the days of the Council of Trent the reforming spirit of the\r\nChurch found its noblest expression in Palestrina's (1524?-94) masses,\r\nbut after his death, after the Catholic Revival had lost its deeply\r\nserious feeling, music took another step. Florence, the old home of\r\ngenius, was the spot. A group of music lovers, who were full of classic\r\ntheories about art, wished to revive antique Greek drama, with its\r\ncombination of poetry, music, and dance. They decided that the words\r\nwere the chief element, that the music must be subservient to the full\r\nemotional expression of the poetry, must intensify the dramatic\r\nsignificance of the story. To give effect to their opinion they devised\r\na method of setting music to declamation, the earliest form of\r\nrecitative. They meant to revive the Greek drama, but they produced the\r\nopera. After a few years of work over the new ideas, in 1600, at the\r\nPitti Palace, an opera was publicly performed in honor of the espousals\r\nof Maria dei Medici and Henry IV of France. This was the first public\r\nperformance of a secular opera. Soon afterwards Monteverdi (1567-1643),\r\na revolutionary genius in the history of music, produced his operas at\r\nMantua. In 1637 the first public opera house was opened in Venice;\r\nothers quickly followed; the opera became a favourite diversion, and\r\nItalian singers carried it to France, Germany, Austria, and England. In\r\nthe same year as the performance in the Pitti Palace, a dramatic\r\noratorio, \"The Soul and the Body,\" was publicly performed in Rome. The\r\noratorio was greatly developed by Carissimi (1604-74) of the Roman\r\nschool, and with him and his successors acquired much stateliness and\r\nbeauty. Its influence on the opera, however, was not good, at least if\r\nwe adopt the opinion of those Florentine Hellenes and of Wagner, for it\r\ndeveloped music as an independent element, and did not subordinate it to\r\ndramatic action.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of this misdevelopment of the opera, all music\r\nevolved brilliantly and well in Italy, and especially in Naples, which\r\neclipsed all other cities, and showed that she, too, had her individual\r\ngenius. Alessandro Scarlatti (1659-1725) wrote a great number of operas\r\nand oratorios, and composed a vast quantity of ecclesiastical music. He\r\nwas followed by his son Domenico Scarlatti, by Durante, Leo, and\r\nJommelli, by Pergolesi, Piccinni, Cimarosa, and Paisiello, who followed\r\none another, like a flight of singing birds, through the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The Italian opera, even then, had the characteristics of\r\nsubordinating dramatic propriety and all semblance of reality to\r\n_arias_, trills, and vocal exaggeration, but it was not till the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century--with Rossini, Bellini,\r\nDonizetti--that the Italian opera (if I may venture to adapt a famous\r\nphrase) became melted Baroque. There were other schools of music at\r\nRome, Bologna, and Venice. It was in Venice that the four famous asylums\r\nfor girls, _conservatori_, were turned into music schools, and gave\r\ntheir name to training schools for musicians all over the world.\r\n\r\nBesides the opera one must note, in mentioning Italian musical genius,\r\nthe violin-makers, the Amati of Cremona, the greater Stradivarius\r\n(1644-1737), and other famous makers of Cremona, Brescia, and Venice;\r\nalso the organ-builders, the Antignati of Brescia; the great Italian\r\nsingers, then as now favourites of the world; as well as the greatest of\r\nlibretto-writers, Metastasio.\r\n\r\nMetastasio (1698-1782) had a career that can only be compared to that of\r\na successful _prima donna_. As a boy he was adopted by the Arcadian\r\nlawyer, Gravina, and brought early to drink of the Pierian spring. After\r\nGravina's death he spent his money, got into the company of singers and\r\nmusicians at Naples, and composed the words of an opera \"Dido,\" while\r\nstill a youth of five-and-twenty. \"Dido\" had immense success, and from\r\nthis time on Metastasio poured out play after play in words that went\r\nhalfway and more to meet the accompanying music. His renown was\r\ntriumphant throughout Europe; he became the pet of lords, ladies, kings,\r\nand Popes. He flitted from court to court, and sipped the honey of\r\nfacile success; he serves as the embodiment of the Italian opera, or\r\nrather as a poetical spirit, a kind of baroque nightingale, to chant the\r\ncharm, the sentiment, the sweetness, the unreality, of these two\r\nmake-believe centuries.\r\n\r\nAs we take leave of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries (a\r\nsomewhat ignoble pair), their architecture, painting, literature, and\r\nmusic, we must, as in other matters, remember the good and forget the\r\nbad. We must keep in mind the Spanish Steps, which offer at their base\r\nample room for all the flowers of all the flower-sellers of Rome, then\r\nrise in easy flight, pause, rest, and mount again, tier upon tier, till\r\nthe top step stretches out into a terrace, where the pedestrian, glad to\r\npause, turns and looks back over Rome towards the majestic dome of St.\r\nPeter's. We must remember the Trevi Fountain where gods and nymphs and\r\nwaters splash and frolic together, or Guido's Aurora, where Apollo\r\nlooses the rein to his heavenly horses as they gallop after Lucifer,\r\nwhile the straight-backed hours dance divinely alongside. We must recall\r\nthe sweet sentiment in Metastasio, the light nothingness of Goldoni, the\r\nmerriment of Harlequin and Columbine, the violins of Stradivarius, the\r\nsinging of Farinello and Pacchierotti, the melodies of Pergolesi, and\r\nthe general pleasantness of an idle, amiable society. Then we want to\r\njoin the eighteenth-century travellers,--Addison, Walpole, President de\r\nBrosses, or Goethe,--and we look back with vain regret to that happy\r\nlotos-eating time, and wish it would return again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE NAPOLEONIC ERA (1789-1820)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow come those great events, most important to Italy, the French\r\nRevolution and the invasion by Napoleon. The storm burst upon a scene of\r\nquiet. Italy was still like a comedy of Goldoni, dukes enjoying taxes\r\nand mistresses, priests accepting oblations and snuff, nobles sipping\r\nchocolate and pocketing rent, while the poor peasants, kept behind the\r\nscenes, sweated and toiled for a bare subsistence.\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution came the premonitory breezes of philosophical\r\nphilanthropy wafted across the Alps from the Encyclopedists. As they\r\naffected the various rulers differently, it is necessary to descend to\r\nsome particulars. In Piedmont no philosophical philanthropy warmed the\r\nking; he wrapped his cloak tighter about him, and deemed the old ways\r\ngood enough. He maintained his court in imitation of Versailles, and\r\ndrilled his soldiers in imitation of Frederick the Great. Nobles alone\r\nwere employed in the higher ranks of the civil service, nobles alone\r\nwere made officers in the army; in return, they were treated like\r\nschoolboys, not allowed to leave a prescribed path without permission.\r\nThe clergy had the privileges of the old regime; their tribunals had\r\nsole jurisdiction over priests, and tried to maintain jurisdiction over\r\nthe laity for all offences that had a smack of sin. King, nobility, and\r\nclergy clung to the autocracy, and were resolved to maintain it in full\r\nvigour. A rash admirer of Montesquieu wrote a treatise upon\r\n\"Constitutional Monarchy,\" and was put in prison.\r\n\r\nIn Lombardy the House of Austria really plunged into reform; it\r\nreorganized the administration, reapportioned taxes, curtailed clerical\r\nprivileges, abolished the Inquisition, improved roads, favoured\r\nagriculture, stimulated trade, and encouraged manufacture. New ideas\r\nwere broached. Beccaria published his famous book \"On Crimes and\r\nPunishments,\" which began the attack on the atrocious, old penal\r\ncruelties. French philosophy was discussed. The physicist Volta, famous\r\nfor his electrical discoveries, occupied a chair in the university at\r\nPavia. Austrian garrisons indeed were on duty, but Lombardy prospered as\r\nit had not done since the days of the Sforzas.\r\n\r\nIn Venice the new ideas did not affect the government. The old system\r\ncontinued. The Great Council of Patricians sat in conservative\r\nindolence; the ornamental Doge shuffled about, the Senate talked, and\r\nthe Council of Ten maintained its petty despotism. Venice was moribund.\r\nHer voice was no more heard in European affairs. Her army had dwindled\r\nto a few undisciplined and inefficient regiments; her arsenal was little\r\nemployed. Gayety, luxury, vice, reigned triumphant; all the young blades\r\nof Europe went thither to carouse.\r\n\r\nIn Parma the flood of philanthropic reform had flowed strong; the\r\nminister of state, a Frenchman, full of Parisian ideas, had introduced\r\nmany beneficial changes, but a new duke, dissipated and devout, slipped\r\nback into the old ways; and its little neighbour, Modena, concentrated\r\nits attention on avoidance of all possible offence to its neighbours.\r\n\r\nIn Tuscany, an appanage of Austria, reform bounded along. The Grand\r\nDuke, Leopold I, proposed to destroy every remnant of the Middle Ages;\r\nhe attacked the power of the ubiquitous priests, granted free trade in\r\ngrain, and equalized taxes,--without discrimination even in favour of\r\nhis own estates. He improved the universities of Pisa and Siena, drained\r\nthe marshes of the Maremma, and led the way in abolishing torture and\r\ncapital punishment; he rendered a public account of the state's\r\nrevenues; and, in short, put in practice the advanced philanthropic\r\nideas on government.\r\n\r\nIn the Papal States, on the other hand, mediaevalism lay heavy. There was\r\nno commerce, no manufacture, little agriculture. Priests were\r\neverywhere, greedy relations of the Pope almost everywhere. No laymen\r\nwere given office. Ancona, a seaport, and Bologna, with its university,\r\nwere the only exceptions to general wretchedness. The finances were in\r\nextreme confusion; the offerings of the faithful, the sale of offices,\r\nthe multiplication of taxes, did little more than pay interest on the\r\nbonded debts. Rome was a little, unimportant, ecclesiastical city.\r\n\r\nIn Naples, however, even the Bourbons felt the fresh breath of\r\nreformation. A reforming minister expelled the Jesuits and tried to\r\nreduce the number of superfluous priests, monks, and nuns, and to root\r\nout the old feudal privileges. In the city itself a goodly company of\r\nmen gathered together, cultivated ideas, and followed the lead of the\r\nFrench philosophers. Poor Sicily, overridden by barons and priests,\r\nlagged behind, a prey to the feudal system, and so unsusceptible to new\r\nideas that the reforming prime minister could not budge the dead weight\r\nof custom. The people preferred to help one another in their own way,\r\nand resorted to that mysterious society, the _Mafia_.\r\n\r\nThus was Italy, half philanthropically inclined, half despotically, with\r\nfew outward indications of the great awakening of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. One such indication might have been found in the life and\r\ncharacter of a gentleman of Turin. Vittorio Alfieri (1749-1803) was a\r\nkind of antique Roman, a new Brutus, of passionate and lofty nature. He\r\nembodied his ideas of liberty in classic tragedies, which stirred\r\nItalian manhood in those days, but now are extremely tedious to read. He\r\nboldly gave vent to his hatred of foreign oppression, preached freedom,\r\nand appealed to the \"future Italian people.\" His autobiography, somewhat\r\ncondensed and expurgated, might be put into Plutarch. He stands in\r\nhistory, not as a great tragedian, but as the first example of the\r\nrebirth of that antique virility which was to display itself so\r\nbrilliantly in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nDown into this little world of periwigs and lavender came the French\r\nRevolution. All who had applauded Alfieri's tragedies were delighted,\r\nexcept Alfieri himself, who hated the French. But the Italian princes\r\ntook fright at the democratic volcano, and talked of a general union\r\nagainst France. Piedmont alone was vigorous enough to take action; she\r\nmade a league with Austria (1792). Nothing important happened until\r\nyoung Napoleon took command of the French army of invasion (1796), and\r\nbegan to tear \"the heart out of Glory.\" It would be useless to relate in\r\ndetail his wonderful career in Italy. He arranged the peninsula as a\r\nhousekeeper shifts the furniture in an unsatisfactory room. He took Nice\r\nand Savoy from Piedmont, Lombardy from Austria, formed the little states\r\nsouth of the Po into a republic, took the temporal power from the Pope,\r\nand set up a Roman Republic. He turned the Kingdom of Naples into a\r\nrepublic and then back again into a kingdom, first for his brother\r\nJoseph, and then for his general, Murat (1808). He converted Genoa into\r\nthe Republic of Liguria. Venice, like old Priam before bloody Pyrrhus,\r\nfell at the whiff and wind of the victor's sword; the Great Council\r\nresigned without a struggle, and the Republic of St. Mark after an\r\nexistence of a thousand years came to its end. It was then handed over\r\nto Austria, but after Austerlitz taken back again. In 1805, having\r\nbecome Emperor, Napoleon turned the northern part of the peninsula into\r\nthe Kingdom of Italy, and put the iron crown of Lombardy on his own\r\nhead, saying, \"God has given it to me, woe to him that touches it.\" In\r\n1806 he put an end to the Holy Roman Empire, and forced the Emperor,\r\nFrancis II, to resign the Imperial crown.\r\n\r\nThe old laws of political gravitation ceased to act, and Italy was\r\nmoulded and broken and moulded anew, as if creation had begun again. The\r\nrevolutionary ideas on which Napoleon's power at first rested had spread\r\neverywhere; liberty, equality, democracy were a part of every man's\r\nstock of familiar thoughts, and the conception of an Italian kingdom,\r\nvaguely associated with the poetic dreams of Dante, Petrarch,\r\nMachiavelli, had become a political fact. Italy was changed forever, the\r\nold Goldoni comedy was gone; Napoleon had given the _coup de grace_ to\r\nthe old regime.\r\n\r\nThere was another side to the Napoleonic domination. A multitude of men\r\nhad been forcibly enlisted in Napoleon's armies; twenty-six thousand, it\r\nis said, perished in the terrible retreat from Moscow. The French were\r\narrogant and they were foreigners. Changes had been made too quickly and\r\nwith too reckless a disregard for Italian wishes. Nobles and clergy had\r\nbeen despoiled of privileges, peasants had been confused and bewildered,\r\nthe pious had been scandalized by Napoleon's treatment of the Pope; all\r\nthese longed for the restoration of the old political divisions and of\r\nthe old easy ways.\r\n\r\nAfter Napoleon's overthrow the Napoleonic states in Italy fell almost\r\nimmediately. The viceroy of the Italian kingdom, Napoleon's stepson\r\nEugene Beauharnais, slunk away; and in the south, after some\r\nvicissitudes, Murat was caught and shot (1815). Kings, dukes, and Pope\r\ncame tripping back to their thrones. The Congress of Vienna decided that\r\nthe doctrines of the French Revolution were quite wrong, that law,\r\norder, and the principle of legitimacy were bound up together, that\r\nstates belonged to their royal families in tail male, and reparcelled\r\nItaly among its petty sovereigns, acting quite as despotically as\r\nNapoleon had done. It gave Venice to Austria, Genoa to Piedmont, and\r\nParma to Marie Louise, the Austrian wife of Napoleon, for her life, as\r\nshe had to be decently provided for. The Dukes of Parma received Lucca\r\nuntil her death, when they were to return to Parma, and then Lucca was\r\nto be annexed to Tuscany. Metternich, Hardenberg, Castlereagh,\r\nTalleyrand, and their associates complimented one another on the happy\r\ncompletion of their task, and the Congress broke up.\r\n\r\nIn Piedmont the king, loyally welcomed home, put back everything to the\r\nposition in which it was before the disturbances; the old dispossessed\r\nnobles were restored to their places in the civil and military service,\r\nand the _carriere ouverte aux talents_ was closed. In Lombardy and\r\nVenice Austrian officials held a tight rein, and a watchful secret\r\nservice (_sbirri_) prowled about ready to pounce on plotting youth like\r\nowls upon field mice. In Parma and Modena the eye of the Austrian\r\ngovernment was always peering and peeping. In Tuscany Austrian influence\r\nalso was dominant; but the Grand Duke was a gentle, kindly, paternal\r\nperson, and his subjects were placidly content, for the old Tuscan fire\r\nhad died out, and no Tuscan was so crazy as to dream of revolution or of\r\na united Italy. In the Papal States the reaction was complete; the\r\nInquisition was restored, the Jesuits recalled, the civil service\r\nlimited to priests. But in Naples the reaction was worst. The\r\ndespicable Ferdinand, who dropped his number IV of Naples to become\r\nFerdinand I of the Two Sicilies, restored the old regime, and swept away\r\nthe autonomy of Sicily, which had had a separate parliament for hundreds\r\nof years, and since 1812 a constitution also. Ferdinand humbly followed\r\nevery hint from Austria. The will of Austria was supreme from Venice to\r\nNaples, and behind Austria was the conservative judgment of the ruling\r\nclasses of all Europe, still frightened by the Revolution. European\r\nnobles and landowners agreed that the riotous desires of the middle\r\nclass and proletariat for political privileges must be crushed down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE REAWAKENING (1820-1821)\r\n\r\n\r\nOutwardly despotism had been triumphantly reestablished, and Popes,\r\nprinces, and privileged persons in general made a gallant attempt to\r\npretend that the French Revolution and the Napoleonic upheaval had never\r\ntaken place. Nevertheless, the quiet on the surface did not extend\r\nunderneath. Inwardly the new ideas and aspirations were fermenting from\r\nPiedmont to Calabria. The _Carbonari_ (Charcoal-burners), a secret\r\nsociety organized against despotism, plotted for freedom and for\r\nconstitutions. Their members were thickest in the Kingdom of Naples, but\r\nspread throughout Italy. The spark necessary to set ablaze this hidden\r\ndiscontent came from Spain. There a successful rebellion obtained a\r\nconstitution. The thrill stirred Naples. A company of soldiers under two\r\nyoung lieutenants rebelled (1820), many joined them, a general put\r\nhimself at their head. The army would not fight them. The insurgents\r\ndemanded a constitution, with a parliament, a free press, trials\r\naccording to law, etc. The dastardly king was frightened into promises,\r\nbut as the insurgents were not content with promises, he granted a\r\nconstitution, and solemnly swore to maintain it. These revolutionary\r\ntumults, however, had alarmed the comfortable, conservative ruling\r\nclasses and their leaders, the Emperors of Austria, Prussia, and Russia.\r\nAn Imperial conference was held at Laybach (1821), and Ferdinand\r\nattended. The new constitution, indeed, forbade him to leave the kingdom\r\nwithout permission from parliament, but he had obtained leave by\r\npromising to argue in favour of the new regime. Whatever his arguments\r\nwere the Holy Alliance disregarded them, and charged Austria with the\r\nduty of restoring despotism in Naples. Austria obeyed. An overpowering\r\narmy easily scattered the Neapolitan constitutionalists and put\r\nFerdinand back. The constitution, parliament, free press, and all the\r\nother obnoxious revolutionary institutions were brushed away, and\r\nFerdinand, having hung up in church a lamp of gold and silver as an\r\noffset to his perjury, inflicted punishment on the late rebels as fast\r\nas he could.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the North had felt the thrill. In Lombardy the hawk-eyed\r\ngovernment pounced down on possible conspirators. Silvio Pellico, the\r\npathetic author of \"Le Mie Prigioni\" (My Prisons), and his friend\r\nMaroncelli, were arrested and put into prison (1820), there to stay for\r\nten years. A little later Confalonieri, head of the Milanese nobility,\r\nand a group of gentlemen were seized and sent to prison. They were set\r\nfree only in 1836, on the accession of a new Emperor. Some of them,\r\nCastillia, Foresti, and Albinola, then sought refuge in the United\r\nStates. I quote from the unpublished diary of an American to show what\r\nkind of men these conspirators were: \"Castillia is an Italian, of an\r\nhonourable Milanese family. At the age of twenty-three he, with other\r\nnoble and brave Italians, lovers of their country, was thrown into the\r\ndungeons of Spielberg (Moravia) by Austrian despots, and there chained\r\nand confined, sometimes in total solitude, enduring the sharpest\r\nprivations and basest ignominies for seventeen years. Then on the\r\naccession of a new Emperor they were released and exiled to\r\nAmerica--they were men of superior intelligence and education,\r\nhonourable gentlemen, true-hearted, loving men--Castillia possessed all\r\nthe virtues that one can name and in their most attractive forms.\"\r\n\r\nWhat these gentlemen suffered for love of their country may be read in\r\n\"Le Mie Prigioni.\" Pellico himself was a Christian saint. After years of\r\nsolitary confinement he and Maroncelli were put together. Maroncelli had\r\na tumour on his leg, which grew so painful that whenever it was\r\nnecessary to move Pellico helped him. \"Sometimes to make the slightest\r\nshift from one position to another cost a quarter of an hour of agony.\"\r\nThe wound was frightful and disgusting. I quote from Pellico: \"In that\r\ndeplorable condition Maroncelli composed poetry, he sang and talked, and\r\ndid everything to deceive me and hide from me a part of his pain. He\r\ncould not digest, or sleep; he grew alarmingly thin, and often went out\r\nof his head; and yet, in a few minutes gathered himself together and\r\ncheered me up. What he suffered for nine months is indescribable.\r\nAmputation was necessary; but first the surgeon had to get permission\r\nfrom Vienna. Maroncelli uttered no cry at the operation, and when he saw\r\nthe leg carried off said to the surgeon, 'You have liberated me from an\r\nenemy, and I have no way to thank you.' By the window stood a tumbler\r\nwith a rose in it. 'Please give me that rose,' he said to me. I handed\r\nit to him, and he gave it to the old surgeon, saying, 'I have nothing\r\nelse to give you in testimony of my gratitude.' The surgeon took the\r\nrose and burst into tears.\" Such was the character of the men who\r\nplotted for the freedom of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Papal States likewise had been quivering. Lord Byron was in Ravenna\r\nat the time. He enrolled in the _Carbonari_, and sent a thousand louis\r\nto the Neapolitan Constitutional Government with an offer to serve\r\nwherever and in whatever capacity they should desire. His letters and\r\ndiary help us to understand the situation.\r\n\r\n      BYRON TO MURRAY, HIS PUBLISHER\r\n\r\n November 23, 1820.\r\n\r\n      Of the state of things here it would be difficult and not\r\n      very prudent to speak at large, the Huns [Austrians] opening\r\n      all letters. I wonder if they can read them when they have\r\n      opened them; if so they may see in my most legible hand that\r\n      I think them damned scoundrels and barbarians, and their\r\n      Emperor a fool, and themselves more fools than he; all which\r\n      they may send to Vienna for anything I care. They have got\r\n      themselves masters of the papal police and are bullying\r\n      away, but some day or other they will pay for all; it may\r\n      not be very soon because these unhappy Italians have no\r\n      consistency among themselves; but I suppose that Providence\r\n      will get tired of them at last.\r\n\r\n      SAME TO SAME\r\n\r\n December 9.\r\n\r\n      I open my letter to tell you a fact which will show the\r\n      state of this country better than I can. The commandant of\r\n      the troops is now lying dead in my house. He was shot about\r\n      two hundred paces from my door.... As nobody could or would\r\n      do anything but howl and pray, and as no one would stir a\r\n      finger to move him for fear of consequences, I had the\r\n      commandant carried upstairs to my own quarters.... Poor\r\n      fellow, he was a brave officer but much disliked by the\r\n      people.\r\n\r\n      EXTRACTS FROM BYRON'S DIARY\r\n\r\n January 6, 1821.\r\n\r\n      To-night at the theatre, there being a prince on his throne\r\n      in the last scene of the comedy, the audience laughed and\r\n      asked him for a constitution. This shows the state of the\r\n      public mind here as well as the assassinations. It won't do.\r\n      There must be a universal republic, and there ought to be.\r\n\r\n January 7.\r\n\r\n      The Count Pietro Gamba took me aside to say that the\r\n      Patriots had had notice from Forli [twenty miles away] that\r\n      to-night the government and its party mean to strike a\r\n      stroke, that the Cardinal here has had orders to make\r\n      several arrests immediately, and that in consequence the\r\n      Liberals are arriving and have posted patrols in the\r\n      streets, to sound the alarm and give notice to fight. He\r\n      asked me \"what should be done.\" I answered, \"Fight for it,\r\n      rather than be taken in detail;\" and offered if any of them\r\n      are in immediate apprehension of arrest to receive them in\r\n      my house (which is defensible), and to defend them with my\r\n      servants and themselves (we have arms and ammunition) as\r\n      long as we can, or to try to get them away under cloud of\r\n      night. On going home I offered him the pistols which I had\r\n      about me.\r\n\r\n January 8.\r\n\r\n      Rose and found Count Pietro Gamba in my apartments. Sent\r\n      away the servant. He told me that according to the best\r\n      information, the government had not issued orders for the\r\n      arrests apprehended; and that as yet they are still only in\r\n      apprehension. He asked me for some arms of a better sort,\r\n      which I gave him. Settled that in case of a row the Liberals\r\n      were to assemble here (with me) and that he had given the\r\n      word to the others for that purpose. Concerted operations. I\r\n      advised them to attack in detail and in different parties,\r\n      in different places, though at the same time, so as to\r\n      divide the attention of the troops, who though few yet being\r\n      disciplined would beat any body of people (not trained) in a\r\n      regular fight, unless dispersed in small parties and\r\n      distracted with different assaults. Offered to let them\r\n      assemble here if they chose. It is a strongish post--narrow\r\n      street, commanded from within--and tenable walls....\r\n\r\n      I wonder what figure these Italians will make in a regular\r\n      row. I sometimes think that like the Irishman's crooked gun\r\n      they will do only for shooting round a corner; at least this\r\n      sort of shooting has been the late tenour of their exploits.\r\n      And yet there are materials in this people and a noble\r\n      energy if well directed. But who is to direct them? No\r\n      matter. Out of such times heroes spring. Difficulties are\r\n      the hotbed of high spirits and Freedom the mother of the few\r\n      virtues incident to human nature.\r\n\r\n January 9.\r\n\r\n      They say the King of Naples has declared, by couriers from\r\n      Florence, to the Powers (as they call now those wretches\r\n      with crowns) that his constitution was compulsive, and that\r\n      the Austrian barbarians are placed again on war pay and will\r\n      march. Let them,--\"they come like sacrifices in their\r\n      trim,\"--the hounds of hell! Let it be a hope to see their\r\n      bones piled like those of the human dogs at Morat, in\r\n      Switzerland.\r\n\r\n January 29.\r\n\r\n      Met a company of the sect (a kind of Liberal Club) called\r\n      the Americani in the forest, and singing with all their\r\n      might in Romagnuol \"Sem tutti soldat' per la liberta\"--(We\r\n      are all soldiers for liberty). They cheered me as I passed;\r\n      I returned their salute and rode on. This may show the\r\n      spirit of Italy at present.\r\n\r\n      They say that the Piedmontese have at length risen--ca ira!\r\n\r\nThe news from Piedmont was true. Some officers in the army proposed to\r\ndemand a constitution from the king and then force him into war with\r\nAustria. They believed that Prince Carlo Alberto, who stood next but one\r\nin succession to the throne, though only a distant cousin of the sonless\r\nking, was in sympathy with them and would act with them. How far they\r\nwere justified in this belief is uncertain. The leading conspirators had\r\nan interview with him, and thought they received satisfactory\r\nassurances. In subsequent explanations he denied any such assurances.\r\nThus encouraged, the garrisons of Alexandria and Turin hoisted the\r\ntricolour of the _Carbonari_, and made their demands. The old king,\r\nVittorio Emanuele, not knowing what to do, resigned in favour of his\r\nyounger brother, Carlo Felice, who was then absent, and appointed Carlo\r\nAlberto regent during the new king's absence. Carlo Alberto, always\r\ninfirm of purpose, with doubt and hesitation took the opportunity and\r\nproclaimed a constitution (March, 1821). But the new king, apprised of\r\nthis wild act, at once annulled it, and bade Carlo Alberto leave the\r\ncountry. Poor Carlo Alberto was in a sad dilemma: should he obey his\r\nking and abandon his liberal friends, or cleave to them and be disloyal\r\nto the king? He obeyed and went to Tuscany. An Austrian army aided the\r\nking to suppress the revolt. The liberals escaped as best they could.\r\nSome fled to Spain by way of Genoa, where they were seen by Giuseppe\r\nMazzini, a lad of sixteen, who thereupon resolved \"that one could, and\r\ntherefore one must, struggle for the liberty of Italy.\"\r\n\r\nThus the revolutionary storms swept by; the _sbirri_ resumed their old\r\nmethods of prying and spying, and dukes and kings deemed themselves\r\nsecure of their own again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nPERTURBED INACTIVITY (1821-1847)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 1821 followed ten years of outward repose. Times were hard for\r\nlovers of independence, but hope and purpose had been let loose, and in\r\ndark corners, cloaking themselves as best they could, the friends of\r\nfreedom groped their way. Openly little was done except by exiles, but\r\nindirect aid came from literature, which followed the romantic movement,\r\nand loudly asserted the revolutionary ideas. There was Ugo Foscolo, the\r\npoet, half Venetian, half Greek, who after the return of the Austrians\r\nrefused to take the oath of allegiance and fled to England, giving, as\r\nwas said, \"to New Italy a new institution, Exile;\" Giovanni Berchet, of\r\nMilan, poet and man of letters; Gabriele Rossetti, of the Abruzzi,\r\nfather of Dante Rossetti, a poet himself; and many others. By far the\r\nmost distinguished was Alessandro Manzoni, a quiet, dignified Milanese\r\ngentleman, who wrote patriotic plays, and the famous romance, \"I\r\nPromessi Sposi\" (The Plighted Lovers). He cheered and comforted his\r\ncompatriots with the thought that in him they possessed a man of letters\r\nwhom Europe recognized as the peer of Scott, Byron, and Goethe. Scott\r\npraised \"I Promessi Sposi\" most generously, and Goethe said, \"It\r\nsatisfies us like perfectly ripe fruit.\"\r\n\r\nGreater than Manzoni, though at the time less widely known, was the sad\r\npoet, Giacomo Leopardi, indisputably the greatest Italian poet since\r\nTasso, and in the judgment of some men to-day, owing perhaps to greater\r\nsympathy with his sentiments, superior to Tasso. Leopardi raised Italian\r\nself-respect, as Manzoni did, by proof that the genius of the race still\r\nlived. He wrote the most patriotic odes since Petrarch. Of these the\r\npoem \"To Italy\" is perhaps most famous. It begins:--\r\n\r\n    O my country, I see the walls, the arches,\r\n    The columns, the statues, the defenceless towers\r\n    Of our forefathers,\r\n    But the glory I do not see.\r\n\r\nLeopardi's wretchedness, in great measure purely personal, was matched\r\nby that of his country. Austrian soldiers, ducal _sbirri_, and Jesuits\r\ndid their best to destroy all vigour, life, and freedom. The press was\r\nstifled; no allusion to freedom was allowed. In a chorus of Bellini's\r\nopera \"I Puritani\" the word _liberty_ was stricken out by the censor and\r\n_loyalty_ substituted; and a singer who forgot the change was sent to\r\nprison for three days. Things were best in Tuscany and worst in Naples,\r\nwhere Francis I, a rake, bigot, and coward, practised the utmost\r\ncruelty. After an insurrection in a village, twenty-six heads were cut\r\noff at his command, and exhibited in cages; and once, when a grandmother\r\nbesought mercy for her two grandsons who were condemned to death, he\r\nbade her choose one. She chose one; the other was shot, and she went\r\nmad.\r\n\r\nThe ten long years of inaction at last passed away, and another wave of\r\nexasperated independence and patriotism swept over the peninsula. The\r\nFrench Revolution of 1830 was the proximate cause. This time, while\r\nPiedmont and Naples remained quiet, for most of their leaders were in\r\nexile or in prison, Parma, Modena, and the Romagna burst into\r\ninsurrection; but the Austrian soldiers marched in, suppressed the\r\nrevolt, and reseated duke, duchess, and Pope. The attention of the\r\nworld, however, had been called to priestly government in the Romagna,\r\nand the five great Powers,--England, France, Austria, Prussia, and\r\nRussia,--not wishing a hotbed of justifiable revolt on the same\r\nContinent with comfortable and privileged ruling classes, wrote a\r\ncollective note to the Pope in which they insisted on certain reforms as\r\nindispensable. The papal Curia made promises, but did nothing, and all\r\nItaly relapsed outwardly into the condition in which she had been during\r\nthe ten years of inaction.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the forces underneath, plotting and conspiring for\r\nfreedom, were stronger than before, and here and there indications of\r\nthis growing sentiment cropped out. In 1831, after the ill-fated,\r\nmelancholy, distrusting, and distrusted Carlo Alberto had succeeded to\r\nthe Kingdom of Sardinia, an anonymous letter addressed to him was spread\r\nbroadcast over Italy. This letter bade him choose between two\r\ncourses,--either to lead the national movement, or to be basely servile\r\nto Austria. \"Bend your back under the German (Austrian) whip and be a\r\ntyrant--But, if as you read these words your mind runs back to that time\r\nwhen you dared look higher than the lordship of a German fief, and if\r\nyou hear within a voice that cries 'You were born for something great,'\r\noh, obey that voice; it is the voice of genius, of opportunity, that\r\noffers you its hand to mount from century to century as far as\r\nimmortality; it is the voice of all Italy, who awaits but one word, one\r\nsingle word, to make herself all your own. Give her that word. Put\r\nyourself at the head of the nation, and on your banner write Union,\r\nFreedom, Independence. Sire, according to your answer, be sure that\r\nposterity will pronounce you either the first of Italian Men, or the\r\nlast of Italian Tyrants. Choose.\"\r\n\r\nCarlo Alberto, melancholy as Hamlet, for the burden put upon him was\r\ngreater than his strength, continued inactive, distrusted, and\r\ndistrusting. His only answer was to give sharper orders against\r\nconspirators. The writer of the letter was a young Genoese of grave\r\ncountenance, with a sweet mouth and sad, handsome eyes, Giuseppe\r\nMazzini, aged twenty-six, who had already abandoned law for literature,\r\nand literature for his country. Suspected of being a _Carbonaro_, he had\r\nbeen arrested and put in prison. His father, having asked the reason,\r\nwas told that \"his son was a young man of talents, very fond of solitary\r\nwalks at night, and habitually silent as to the subject of his\r\nmeditations, and that the Sardinian government was not fond of young men\r\nof talents the subject of whose meditations it did not know.\" In prison\r\nMazzini became convinced that the true aim of patriots was the unity of\r\nall Italy, and that the means should be the people, not the princes.\r\nAfter a few months of imprisonment he was banished. It was then that he\r\nwrote the letter.\r\n\r\nIn exile he began the task of rousing the Italian people throughout the\r\npeninsula to the need of common effort for a common end. He organized a\r\nsecret society, and named it Young Italy. Its purpose was to make Italy\r\nfree, united, and republican. The first article of its constitution\r\nread: \"This society is instituted for the destruction, now become\r\nindispensable, of all the governments of the peninsula, and for the\r\nunion of all Italy in a single state under republican government.\" The\r\nnew society spread rapidly, and was, perhaps, the greatest individual\r\ncause of final success.\r\n\r\nMazzini was a master conspirator, a very St. Paul of the Risorgimento.\r\nHis whole life was a passionate renunciation of all the pleasures and\r\ncomforts for which most men live, and a passionate dedication of himself\r\nto his ideals. He is a striking illustration of the saying, The man\r\nwhose heart is lifted up within him shall not find the path smooth\r\nbefore him, but the just shall live by his faith. His ideals soared\r\nhigher and higher; not content with hope for Italy, he made plans for\r\nhelping all Europe. He became an object of suspicion all over the\r\nContinent, and was driven from country to country, till he finally went\r\nto England, but he never ceased to preach and teach, to urge and\r\nencourage, to plot and counterplot. He believed in sacrifice, both of\r\nhimself and of others, and instigated desperate uprisings. One of these,\r\na wild invasion of Piedmont which came to nothing, is memorable because\r\namong the list of those who were subsequently proscribed for\r\nparticipation in it was a young seaman, a native of Nice, then a part of\r\nSavoy, Giuseppe Garibaldi. Mazzini himself stayed in England, where the\r\ncruelest accusations were made against him. He endured slander, malice,\r\npoverty, outward failure, still steadfast at his task. He says, \"I have\r\nnot for an instant thought that unhappiness may influence our actions.\"\r\nHe knew Carlyle, who bore witness in his favour: \"I have had the honour\r\nto know Mr. Mazzini for a series of years, and whatever I may think of\r\nhis practical insight and skill in worldly affairs, I can with great\r\nfreedom testify that he, if I have ever seen one such, is a man of\r\ngenius and virtue, one of those rare men, numerable unfortunately but as\r\nunits in this world, who are worthy to be called martyr souls; who, in\r\nsilence, piously in their daily life understand and practise what is\r\nmeant by that.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Young Italy and the _Carbonari_ worked in secret, literature\r\ncontinued to carry on the task of arousing enthusiasm for national\r\nachievements and national ideals. The patient piety of Silvio Pellico's\r\n\"Le Mie Prigioni\" was a most effective denunciation of Austrian tyranny;\r\nthe plays of Giovan Battista Niccolini, of Florence, on subjects famous\r\nfor Italian patriotism, were stirring appeals against despotism, civil\r\nand ecclesiastical; the romantic novels of Massimo d'Azeglio, of\r\nPiedmont, the patriot painter and statesman, reminded youth of the great\r\ndays of old; other novels, passionate and patriotic, by Tommaso Grossi,\r\nof Belluno, and by Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi, of Leghorn, did\r\nlikewise. These romances so pitifully uninteresting to-day did much;\r\nbut a book of a different character had in its way a still more\r\nbrilliant career. Vincenzo Gioberti, of Turin, began life by taking\r\norders; he became patriotic, was suspected, imprisoned, exiled; in exile\r\nhe studied, taught, and thought. In 1843 he published in Brussels \"Il\r\nprimato morale e civile degli Italiani\" (The Moral and Civil Primacy of\r\nthe Italians), a book that rehearsed the old glory of Italy and pointed\r\nout new ways by which that ancient glory might be renewed. Gioberti\r\nadvocated a confederation of the Italian States (excluding the Austrian\r\nprovinces) with the Pope at its head. The book had tremendous success;\r\nits ideas were accepted and became a party creed; and Gioberti is\r\nentitled to rank as one of the factors in the Risorgimento. Oddly\r\nenough, as it seems to us now, his plan was on the verge of execution.\r\n\r\nAt this time Gregory XVI was Pope, a reactionary man, devoted to\r\necclesiastical history, and, according to his detractors, to Orvietan\r\nwine. He showed the extreme of papal incapacity for civil\r\nadministration; in the papal cities was squalor, in the country\r\nbrigandage, in both dense ignorance. But on Gregory's death Cardinal\r\nMastai-Ferretti, an amiable, smiling, charming, handsome, liberal-minded\r\ncardinal, who had applauded Gioberti, became Pius IX (July, 1846).\r\nWithin a month or two Pius granted amnesty to political prisoners,\r\nappointed a commission to study the necessary reforms in his states;\r\npermitted, tacitly at least, liberty of the press; announced a Council\r\nof State to consist of lay members; and authorized the organization of\r\na civic guard. He was hailed with enthusiasm throughout the peninsula.\r\nHere was Gioberti's ideal Pope. Here was the man to lead the Italian\r\nGuelfs and drive the Barbarians from Italy.\r\n\r\nThat the ecclesiastical head of organized conservatism, the great\r\nbulwark of authority, the maintainer of ancient things, should be hailed\r\nas a saviour by men desiring independence, freedom, and war, needs a\r\nword of further explanation. In this period of decadence and servitude,\r\nwhile Austrian officers played the peacock on every _piazza_ from Milan\r\nto Naples, Italians could remember that an Italian Pope was head of the\r\ngreatest corporate body in the world, that tribute was paid into his\r\ntreasury from every country in Europe, that kings treated him with\r\ndeference, and that from East and West hundreds of servant bishops came\r\nto the foot of his throne. These thoughts, coupled with inapplicable\r\nmemories and desperate hopes, led men to regard Pius IX as the\r\npredestined leader of the liberal movement; and shouts of \"Hurrah for\r\nItaly, the Pope, and the Constitution!\" were heard throughout the\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\nHope, too, arose in Piedmont. King Carlo Alberto received Massimo\r\nd'Azeglio in audience (1845), and bade his astonished subject tell his\r\nfriends that when the occasion should present itself, his own life, his\r\nsons' lives, his treasure, and his army would all be spent for the\r\nItalian cause. A year later the king withstood Austria in a dispute over\r\ncustoms; and a little later still, at an agrarian congress a member\r\nrose and read a letter from the king which ended, \"If ever God shall\r\ngive us grace to be able to undertake a war of independence, no one but\r\nme shall command the army. Oh, what a glorious day will that be when we\r\nshall be able to utter the cry of national independence!\"\r\n\r\nThus encouraged by king and Pope, patriots, from Piedmont to Sicily,\r\nwaited in tremulous expectation for the coming of great events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTUMULTUOUS YEARS (1848-1849)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe period of waiting for coming events was short. The whole Continent\r\nof Europe was straining like a greyhound in its leash; Italy, from end\r\nto end, was on tiptoe with excitement; and the year 1848 came rushing in\r\nwith swashbuckler fury.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the revolutionary movement began in Palermo. The people\r\nattacked the Bourbon soldiers and drove them out. Their example was\r\nfollowed throughout the island. Across the channel Naples arose and\r\ndemanded a constitution. The frightened king granted it (January 29). In\r\nPiedmont at an assemblage of journalists, the director of a newspaper,\r\n\"The Risorgimento,\" declared that the time appropriate to petitions for\r\nthe banishment of the Jesuits and for the institution of a national\r\nguard had passed, and that a constitution should be demanded. The\r\nspeaker was a stoutish man of thirty-eight, with a square face under a\r\nhigh forehead. He wore spectacles, and under his chin a fringe of beard\r\nran round from ear to ear like a ravelled bonnet string; he looked like\r\na distinguished and amiable professor, except that there was a pinch to\r\nhis nostrils and a compression to his lips which suggested an arrogant\r\nlineage and inherited notions of \"Let those take that have the power,\r\nand let them keep that can.\" In fact, Count Camillo Cavour belonged to\r\nthe old Piedmontese aristocracy. As a lad he served in the engineer\r\ncorps of the army, then travelled in England (which he admired greatly)\r\nand in France, studying all kinds of social matters, from machinery to\r\nconstitutions. On his estates he was a practical farmer, and he took\r\nkeen interest in public life. It was at this time that he first became a\r\nman of note.\r\n\r\nThe city of Turin took up Cavour's cry, and the king acceded. The Grand\r\nDuke of Tuscany granted a constitution. The Pope was slow to bestir\r\nhimself, but the news of revolutionary success in Paris quickened his\r\ngait, and he too granted a constitution. In the Austrian provinces,\r\nLombardy and Venetia, there were tumults, arrests, cavalry charges, and\r\nmartial law; then came news of the revolt in Vienna itself and word that\r\nthe scared Emperor promised a constitution. Venice accepted the promise;\r\nbut Milan, where a citizen had been killed by the soldiers, broke into\r\nrebellion. Carts, carriages, tables, chairs, pianos, bedsteads, were\r\nheaped up to defend the streets; sixteen hundred and fifty barricades\r\nwere erected; men snatched knives, hammers, arquebuses, axes; all took\r\npart,--boys, lads, old men, priests. These were the famous _Five Days_\r\nof Milan. Every street, every house was a battleground, and Field\r\nMarshal Radetzky, with fourteen thousand men, was driven from the city.\r\nRevolt spread through Lombardy. When the news reached Venice the\r\ncitizens rose, forced the Austrian governors to surrender, and\r\nproclaimed anew the Republic of Venice. Daniele Manin was made\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nThis glorious news, Venice republican, Milan victorious over Radetzky,\r\nflew to Turin. Every liberal went mad with excitement. The centuries of\r\nnational humiliation seemed past. Now had come the hour for which\r\nPiedmont had trained and disciplined itself, for which it had hoped and\r\nlonged; now should Piedmont uplift Italy and fight its country's battle.\r\nCavour cried that there was but one possible course,--immediate war with\r\nAustria. A great crowd in tremulous anxiety thronged before the royal\r\npalace. At midnight on March 23, Carlo Alberto stepped out on his\r\nbalcony and waved a tricolour scarf. Next day a royal proclamation\r\nstated that the Piedmontese army would march to the aid of Lombardy and\r\nVenice. A shout of joy went up throughout Italy. Modena and Parma cast\r\nout their dukes and sent recruits to help. The Grand Duke of Tuscany,\r\nthe Pope, even the King of Naples, compelled by necessity, each sent an\r\narmy. The war was a national crusade.\r\n\r\nAt first the campaign went well. The Italian allies numbered more than\r\nninety thousand men; and Carlo Alberto, leading the main body, forced\r\nthe Austrians under Radetzky within the quadrilateral made by the strong\r\nfortresses, Verona, Peschiera, Mantua, and Legnano. But the King of\r\nSardinia was no general; he lacked energy, decision, character. While he\r\ndawdled, not knowing what to do, Radetzky received reinforcements. This\r\nhesitation and delay cooled the first glorious burst of union and\r\nfreedom. Pius IX felt doubts; what right had the Vicar of Christ to take\r\npart in war? Were not Austrians and Italians alike in the sight of God?\r\nWhat had the Universal Church to do with national divisions? And might\r\nnot Austria become heretic and secede from the papal rule? He said he\r\nwould not fight. So great, however, were the tumults in Rome that he was\r\nforced to face about once again, but his tergiversation gave a fatal\r\nblow to the cause. In Naples the watchful Ferdinand, eager for a\r\npretext, took advantage of some street riots to dissolve parliament, and\r\nbade his army come home. One general with a few hundred men disobeyed,\r\nbut the rest turned back.\r\n\r\nIn the north the old jealousies between the Italian States wedged\r\nthemselves in and broke the new-made union. Venice, instead of uniting\r\nwith Piedmont in a joint political confederation, insisted upon\r\nremaining an independent republic, and Milan hesitated out of jealousy\r\nof Turin. Of these discords and hesitations the octogenarian Radetzky\r\ntook advantage. Within thirty days the Tuscan army had been destroyed,\r\nthe papal army made prisoners, and Piedmont was left alone to maintain\r\nthe Italian cause in the field. In a three days' battle at Custoza (July\r\n23-25) the issue was decided. The beaten Piedmontese were forced to\r\nsurrender Milan, and to retreat across the river Ticino into their own\r\nland, and Austria returned triumphant into full possession of her\r\nprovinces, except the city of Venice. The little Dukes of Parma and\r\nModena returned also.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the current of events ran equally fast. In Sicily Ferdinand\r\nbombarded the revolted city of Messina (hence his nickname Bomba), and\r\nforced it to surrender; and in Naples he made a mock of the\r\nconstitution. Rome was in horrid confusion. Pius IX appointed Pellegrino\r\nRossi prime minister, in hope that his energy and vigour might restore\r\npeace and quiet; but Rossi was murdered on the steps of the\r\n_Cancelleria_. Rioters wandered at will about the city. Shots were fired\r\nnear the papal palace on the Quirinal. The Pope, terribly frightened,\r\nfled from the city, and took refuge across the Neapolitan border at\r\nGaeta. He was besought to return, but would not. The revolutionary\r\nleaders convoked an assembly of Roman citizens to decide what form of\r\ngovernment to adopt, and, though the Pope hurled excommunications at all\r\nwho should take part, the radicals met (February 5, 1849), declared the\r\nTemporal Power at an end, and established the Roman Republic. In Tuscany\r\nthe republican fire likewise blazed up; the Grand Duke ran after the\r\nPope to Gaeta, and a provisional government was appointed with a\r\ntriumvirate at its head.\r\n\r\nIn the north, Piedmont and Austria renewed the war. On March 23, at\r\nNovara, a little town on the Piedmontese side of the Ticino, the\r\ndeciding battle was fought. The Austrians were completely victorious.\r\nKing Carlo Alberto asked for a truce. Radetzky's terms were so severe\r\nthat the king, feeling himself the chief cause of this severity,\r\nresolved to be of no further detriment to his country. He abdicated in\r\nfavour of his son, Vittorio Emanuele II, and went into exile, where he\r\nsoon died. The young king made peace on harsh terms.\r\n\r\nAll rational hope for the Italian cause was at an end, but the\r\ndismembered parts struggled on. The men of Brescia defended themselves\r\ngloriously for days, barricading every alley and making a fort of every\r\nhouse, but they were overpowered; the Austrian general Haynau inflicted\r\natrocities that made his name a byword throughout Europe. His own report\r\nsays, \"I ordered that no prisoner should be taken, but that every person\r\nseized with arms in his hands should be immediately put to death, and\r\nthat the houses from which shots came should be burned.\"[23] In Sicily\r\nthe revolutionists resisted in vain, and the king's authority was\r\nreestablished throughout the island. In Naples all liberals were\r\nshamefully and most cruelly persecuted. In Tuscany the mild-mannered\r\nTuscans, dismayed at their own radical government, invited the Grand\r\nDuke to return; so he came, bringing Austrian soldiers with him.\r\n\r\nIn Rome still more notable events happened. Mazzini, as member of the\r\nrevolutionary triumvirate, was at the head of the government. His task\r\nwas hard, for the Pope had asked the Catholic Powers to restore him, and\r\nSpain, Naples, Austria, and France, hastened to obey. France interfered\r\nbecause Louis Napoleon, president of the new republic, wished the\r\nsupport of the French clerical party; nevertheless, he had to proceed\r\ncautiously in order not to vex the liberals, and pursued a wavering\r\ncourse. He said he would send an army to defend real liberty, and would\r\nlet the Romans decide for themselves what they wanted. The French\r\nsoldiers advanced to the walls of Rome (April 29, 1849); the Roman\r\nrepublicans were naturally suspicious and treated them as enemies.\r\nSkirmishes were fought, and the French constrained to retire. Meanwhile,\r\nan Austrian army came from the north, the Neapolitans from the south,\r\nand the Spaniards landed at the mouth of the Tiber. The French intimated\r\nto the Austrians that this was their affair; the Romans, reinforced by\r\nGaribaldi and his Legion, drove back the Neapolitans; and the Spaniards\r\nretired quietly, thus leaving France to deal with the situation as she\r\ndeemed best. French reinforcements arrived, and fighting was begun\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe Italians defended themselves for three weeks; their soldiers, though\r\nbrave, were raw, many of them mere volunteers, and ineffectual against\r\nregular troops. As Mazzini was the hero in council, so Garibaldi was the\r\nhero on the field of battle. The last of knight-errants, he was the very\r\nincarnation of Romance and Revolution. Bred to the sea, this Savoyard\r\nfrom Nice always retained the jaunty, gallant bearing of a mariner. His\r\ncountenance (childlike and lionlike),--with its broad, tranquil brow,\r\nbenign eye, and resolute mouth,--in youth all sparkling, gradually\r\nchanged with care and disillusion, but he still kept the seaman's mien\r\nand the seaman's lightsome eye. He was the beau ideal of a romantic\r\nhero. After his unsuccessful raid into Piedmont he had gone to South\r\nAmerica, where he lived a wild life of guerilla warfare, fighting like a\r\nPaladin on behalf of republican revolutionaries who were struggling for\r\ntheir freedom. All the time he was training a band of Italian\r\nadventurers, his Legion, so that they should be ready when their country\r\nhad need of them. These men rushed to the defence of Rome. Their entry\r\ninto the city was most picturesque. The gaunt soldiers, wearing red\r\nshirts and pointed hats topped with plumes, their legs bare, their\r\nbeards full-grown, their faces tanned to copper colour, with their long\r\nblack hair dangling unkempt, looked like so many Fra Diavolos. At their\r\nhead Garibaldi, in his red shirt, with loose kerchief knotted round his\r\nthroat, the regular beauty of his noble, leonine face set off by his\r\nwaving hair, mounted on a milk-white horse, rode like a demi-god.\r\n\r\nBesides this Legion, troops of volunteers came from all over Italy. The\r\ncharacter of these patriots may be learned from Mazzini's account of the\r\nyoung Genoese poet Goffredo Mameli, who was killed there. \"For me, for\r\nus exiles of twenty years who have grown old in illusions, he was like a\r\nmelody of youth, a presentiment of times that we shall not see, in which\r\nthe instinct of goodness and sacrifice will dwell unconscious in the\r\nhuman soul, and will not be, as virtue is in us, the fruit of long and\r\nhard struggles. Of a disposition lovingly yielding, he was only happy\r\nwhen he could abandon himself to those he loved, as a child in his\r\nmother's caress; and yet Mameli was unshakably firm in what touched the\r\nfaith he had embraced. He was handsome, but careless of his appearance,\r\nand sensitive as a woman to the charm of flowers and sweet scents. Such\r\nwas he when I knew him first at Milan in 1848, and we loved each other\r\nat once. It was impossible to see him and not love him. Only twenty-two,\r\nhe joined the extremes rarely found united, a childlike gentleness and\r\nthe energy of a lion, to be revealed, and which was revealed, in supreme\r\nemergencies.\"\r\n\r\nThe defence of Rome was vain. Mazzini escaped by means of an English\r\npassport, and Garibaldi led a handful of men eastward hoping to reach\r\nVenice. The French soldiers marched into the city, and reestablished the\r\nTemporal Power of the Pope. Venice alone remained. Daniele Manin, the\r\nvaliant dictator, maintained a stout defence for four months, but\r\ncholera and hunger came to the enemy's aid. On August 24 the city\r\ncapitulated, and on the 30th Marshal Radetzky heard the _Te Deum_ of\r\nAustrian gratitude played in St. Mark's. In all Italy, except Piedmont,\r\nthe reaction had triumphed; Piedmont alone was left to become the centre\r\nof whatever hopes of independence and unity still existed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] _The Liberation of Italy_, Evelyn M. Cesaresco, p. 144.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE UNITY OF ITALY (1849-1871)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the uprisings of 1848-49, the old tyrannical system prevailed for\r\neight years and seemed heavier than ever. Liberalism meant suspicion,\r\ndisfavour, danger. The liberals were not very numerous and did not agree\r\namong themselves. Some looked for hope to Piedmont, some to England,\r\nsome to France. Some were for a republic, some for a confederation, some\r\nfor unity; some wished insurrection, others lawful agitation.\r\n\r\nIn Naples the king busied himself with putting the liberals in dungeons.\r\nAccording to the general belief the number of prisoners for political\r\noffences in the Two Sicilies was between fifteen and thirty thousand.\r\nAmong them was Baron Carlo Poerio, \"a refined and accomplished\r\ngentleman, a respected and blameless character,\" at one time one of the\r\nministers of the Crown. It happened that Mr. Gladstone, travelling for\r\nthe benefit of a daughter's health, passed several months in Naples at\r\nthis time (1850-51). He attended trials of the liberal prisoners,\r\nlistened to a \"long tissue of palpable lies told by witnesses suborned\r\nby the government,\" and visited the horrible and filthy prisons. After\r\nhis return to England he published his \"Letters to the Earl of\r\nAberdeen.\" He set forth before the English people \"the horrors--amidst\r\nwhich the government of that country (Naples) is now carried on.\" He\r\nsaid that \"the present practices of the Government of Naples in\r\nreference to real or supposed political offenders are an outrage upon\r\nreligion, upon civilization, upon humanity, and upon decency.\" He\r\ndescribed the \"incessant, systematic, deliberate violation of the law by\r\nthe Power appointed to watch over and maintain it.\" \"It is the wholesale\r\npersecution of virtue,--it is the awful profanation of public\r\nreligion,--it is the perfect prostitution of the judicial office,--this\r\nis 'The negation of God erected into a system of government.'\" He\r\nrecounted Poerio's trial at length, and told how Poerio and fifteen\r\nothers were confined in a room about thirteen feet long and eight feet\r\nhigh, in which they slept, always chained two by two. These chains were\r\nnever taken off, day or night. He ended by saying, \"It is time that\r\neither the veil should be lifted from scenes fitter for hell than earth,\r\nor some considerable mitigation should be voluntarily adopted. I have\r\nundertaken this wearisome and painful task, in the hope of doing\r\nsomething to diminish a mass of human suffering as huge, I believe, as\r\nacute, to say the least, as any that the eye of Heaven beholds.\"\r\n\r\nThese letters were sent by Lord Palmerston to every government in\r\nEurope, and helped to awaken general European sympathy for the oppressed\r\nliberals of Italy.\r\n\r\nIn the Papal States Pius IX put himself wholly in the hands of the\r\nreactionaries and the Jesuits. His government was practically imbecile.\r\nBrigands came and went at will. In Forlimpopoli, for instance, a city of\r\nthe Romagna, a famous highwayman and his band appeared on the stage of a\r\ntheatre, and made the spectators empty their pockets of their money and\r\nof their front-door keys. In Modena, Parma, and Tuscany the governments\r\ndid whatever they deemed would be pleasing to Austria; and in Lombardy\r\nand Venice the Austrians repressed the slightest signs of patriotism.\r\n\r\nIn Piedmont alone was there light ahead. The young king was the\r\nembodiment of the best qualities of his race. The statues of him, carved\r\nin the first fury of patriotism, which disfigure many a _piazza_, reveal\r\nonly his corpulence, his monstrous mustachios, and the forceful ugliness\r\nof his shrewd face. Victor Emmanuel was a soldier born, of careless\r\nmanners, imperious and brusque, yet with a charm of obvious honesty that\r\nwon men's hearts and gained for him the title of _il re galantuomo_. He\r\nreminds one of Henry of Navarre, in his dash, his impetuous energy, his\r\nshrewdness, his deserved popularity, and his eternally youthful\r\nreadiness to fall in love. After the defeat at Novara (1849) pressure\r\nwas put upon him to return to the autocratic system, and, it is said,\r\nAustria offered him easier terms if he would. He had been brought up\r\nwith the old ideas of the royal position, but he was statesman enough to\r\nperceive that if Piedmont and the House of Savoy were to lead in the\r\nmovement of Italian independence, they must win the confidence of the\r\nliberals; and he had sworn to maintain the constitution. He was always\r\na man of his word, whatever policy might advise, and answered that he\r\nshould be loyal to the constitution.\r\n\r\nPiedmont's history for the next few years is a record of liberal\r\nlegislation, as it was then understood. This legislation was especially\r\ndirected against antiquated ecclesiastical privileges, with the purpose\r\nof realizing Cavour's principle, \"A free Church in a free State.\" A\r\nlittle later Cavour was called to the head of the government, and for\r\nten years, with certain brief exceptions, he remained the chief figure\r\non the Italian stage. There are diverse judgments on the very diverse\r\nmerits of the master-builders of the Italian kingdom; some admire most\r\nMazzini, the indefatigable conspirator, the dreamy idealist, the nobly\r\nfanatical republican; others, Garibaldi, the man after Petrarch's heart,\r\nthe rival of Roland or the Cid; others, Victor Emmanuel, the honourable,\r\nbold, shrewd, resolute king; but all agree that Cavour's brilliant\r\ndiplomacy entitles him to rank as one of the world's great statesmen,\r\nand that his work was indispensable to the establishment of the Italian\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nThis period prior to the war with Austria is Cavour's. He set the\r\nfinances of Piedmont on a better basis; he began a series of measures\r\nfor the development of her resources; he secured various internal\r\nreforms, but his brilliant achievement was in his foreign policy. He\r\nknew that the Austrians could not be dispossessed without a war, that\r\nPiedmont was not strong enough of herself, and that in order to gain\r\nallies she must get a hearing before Europe. The Crimean War gave\r\nCavour an opportunity. England and France would have preferred Austria\r\nas an ally, and there was much cautious proceeding; but Austria\r\nhesitated, and Piedmont offered herself. Many Italians deemed the plan\r\nof taking part in a war with which Piedmont had no visible concern a\r\npiece of folly; but Cavour carried his point. The Piedmontese army went,\r\nbehaved with credit, and effaced the unfavourable impression left by the\r\ndisastrous campaigns of 1848-49. The fruits of the Crimean expedition\r\nwere gathered at the Congress of Paris (1856), where Cavour, supported\r\nby England and France, was able to call the attention of the Congress to\r\nthe condition of Italy. He pointed to the tyranny of Austria in Lombardy\r\nand Venetia, to the abominable condition of the Papal States, to the\r\nhorrible misgovernment in the Two Sicilies; and he pointed to Piedmont\r\nas the bulwark against Austrian preponderance on the one hand, and\r\nagainst the revolutionary spirit on the other. Nothing definite was\r\ndone, but the Italian question had been broached, and Cavour's\r\nparticipation in the Congress was recognized as a great achievement.\r\n\r\nPiedmont's leadership was helped by rash revolts elsewhere, easily put\r\ndown and cruelly punished; and it became plainer and plainer that\r\nthrough the steady, orderly monarchy of Sardinia deliverance was to\r\ncome, if at all, and not through the visionary schemes of Mazzini. The\r\ndark, mysterious plans of Napoleon III now loomed on the horizon.\r\nRelations between him and Cavour became closer. Cavour, no doubt, would\r\nhave liked to gain his ends without French aid, but that could not be\r\ndone. The only other possible ally, England, would not interfere. In the\r\nsummer of 1858 an understanding was reached between him and Napoleon\r\nthat in case of Austrian aggression France would aid Piedmont. On\r\nJanuary 1, 1859, Napoleon hinted to the world what had happened; on\r\nJanuary 10, Victor Emmanuel at the opening of the Piedmontese parliament\r\nsaid that the political situation was not free from perils ahead, \"for\r\nwhile we respect treaties, we cannot disregard the cry of pain which\r\ncomes to us from so many parts of Italy.\" Count Cavour asked for a loan\r\nof 50,000,000 lire. Affairs moved fast. Relations between Piedmont and\r\nAustria were strained taut; but it was essential that Austria should be\r\nthe aggressor. Russia and England, in order to prevent war, suggested a\r\nEuropean Congress to consider matters. Napoleon consented; and Cavour,\r\nwho knew that freedom for Italy could only be obtained by war, feared\r\nthat his chance had gone. There was talk of disarmament, but no\r\nagreement had been reached, when Austria, impatient and arrogant, sent\r\nan ultimatum to Piedmont that she must disarm prior to the Congress.\r\nVictor Emmanuel refused and war was declared.\r\n\r\nThe French Emperor crossed the Alps, and in June the allies won the\r\nbattles of Magenta and Solferino. The Italians believed that Austria\r\nwould now be driven from every foot of Italian soil: when, suddenly,\r\nwithout consulting Piedmont, Napoleon, for reasons of French policy,\r\nmade peace with Austria. The Emperor of Austria ceded Lombardy to\r\nNapoleon, and Napoleon transferred it to Piedmont; and, as a sop to the\r\nspirit of Italian unity, both Emperors agreed to favour the scheme of a\r\nconfederation of the Italian States with the Pope at its head, but the\r\nlatter plan was left in the air. This was the end of the high hopes of\r\nItalian freedom and unity. Italy had received a slap in the face. Cavour\r\nwas furious; he had a stormy interview with his king, and passionately\r\nurged him not to consent, but the king had the good sense to see that he\r\nmust. Cavour immediately resigned.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the war had caused the recall of the Austrian troops south of\r\nthe Po, and the patriots had risen in joy. The Grand Duke of Tuscany,\r\nthe Duke of Modena, the Duchess Regent of Parma, the papal legates of\r\nthe Romagna, ran away, and provisional governments were established; but\r\na permanent political disposition was attended with difficulties. The\r\nstates themselves wished to join Piedmont, but the wish was not\r\nunanimous, for many people wanted to preserve local autonomy and their\r\nold historic boundaries. Napoleon favoured his vague confederacy, and a\r\nEuropean Congress supported his view. Indecision reigned, but the cause\r\nof national union triumphed through the vigour of Count Bettino\r\nRicasoli, a man of iron character, head of the provisional government in\r\nTuscany. \"We must,\" he wrote, \"no longer speak of Piedmont, nor of\r\nFlorence, nor of Tuscany; we must speak neither of fusion nor\r\nannexation, but of the union of the Italian people under the\r\nconstitutional government of Victor Emmanuel.\"[24] Certainly the\r\nfugitive dukes could only return by force, and though Continental Europe\r\napproved their return, there was nobody to supply the force. The little\r\nstates voted to join Piedmont. Piedmont, however, hesitated, in fear of\r\nEuropean contradiction. Nobody but Cavour could manage the matter, and\r\nhe was recalled to office (1860). Cavour appealed to the doctrine of the\r\npopular will to be expressed by a _plebiscite_. France, however, would\r\nonly consent upon cession of Savoy and Nice, a measure already talked of\r\nas the price of the French alliance; and in spite of the reluctance of\r\nthe king to surrender Savoy, the cradle of his race, the price had to be\r\npaid. The cession was made, and Parma, Modena, Tuscany, and the Romagna\r\nwere united with the Kingdom of Sardinia under the name of the Kingdom\r\nof Italy (April 15, 1860).\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Ferdinand II, King of the Two Sicilies, had died, hated\r\nand despised by everybody, and his son Francis II, a weak, ignorant,\r\nbigoted lad, had mounted the throne. He refused a suggestion of Victor\r\nEmmanuel to join in the war against Austria, threw himself into the arms\r\nof the reactionary party, and made an alliance with the Pope. The\r\ndiscontented liberals took courage at the news from the north. In April,\r\n1860, the revolt began in Palermo, and, though suppressed there, spread.\r\nTwo young patriots, Francesco Crispi and Rosalino Pilo, went about\r\nstirring the people to action. Garibaldi was begged to put himself at\r\nthe head of the proposed revolution. On the night of May 6, two ships,\r\nthe Lombardy and the Piedmont, secretly left Genoa, and took Garibaldi\r\nand a thousand volunteers aboard. This band, known as _i Mille_, is\r\nnearly as famous and as legendary as King Arthur and his Round Table. On\r\nMay 11, the ships landed at Marsala. Two Neapolitan cruisers came up,\r\nbut two English men-of-war happened to be there also; and the English\r\ncaptains, under guise of friendly notification to the Neapolitans, took\r\nsome action which delayed the latter long enough to let the last\r\nGaribaldians disembark. Once on shore, Garibaldi's volunteers ran to\r\nsecure the telegraph office. They arrived just after the operator had\r\ntelegraphed that two Piedmontese ships, filled with troops, had come\r\ninto the harbour; a Garibaldian was able to add to the message, \"I have\r\nmade a mistake; they are two merchantmen.\" The answer came back,\r\n\"Idiot.\" The volunteers marched inland. A provisional government was\r\norganized; Garibaldi was made dictator, and Crispi secretary of state.\r\nThe cry was \"Italy and Victor Emmanuel!\" Garibaldi was joined by\r\ninsurgent Sicilians, and, with numbers considerably increased, fought\r\nand defeated the Bourbon army. The story reads like the exploits of\r\nHector before the Greek trenches. Victory followed victory. Palermo\r\nfell, Milazzo and Messina; then he crossed the straits and invaded\r\nCalabria (August). This marvellous triumph, for there had been thirty\r\nthousand regular troops to oppose Garibaldi, frightened King Francis; he\r\nproclaimed a constitution, appealed to Napoleon, and even to Victor\r\nEmmanuel, for help. It was too late. Garibaldi swept on victorious, and\r\nthe king fled from Naples (September 6); the next day Garibaldi marched\r\nin and assumed dictatorship of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nEngland approved, but Continental Europe looked askance at this\r\nirregular proceeding, and Victor Emmanuel and Cavour began to feel\r\nuneasy, apprehensive lest the Great Powers should intervene in Italian\r\naffairs. It was a difficult situation. Garibaldi was moving on\r\nnorthward, and proclaimed his intention of going to Rome, regardless of\r\nthe French army stationed there, and then to Venice, regardless of the\r\nEuropean treaties that gave Venice to Austria. Besides, the Pope had\r\ncollected an army (largely of foreign recruits) to suppress the liberal\r\nmovements in Umbria and the Marches, and to give aid to the Neapolitan\r\nking. Here were further opportunities for foreign intervention.\r\nEvidently Cavour must act promptly if he wished Piedmont to continue to\r\ncontrol the national movement. He requested the Pope to dismiss his new\r\narmy. The Pope refused. The Piedmontese army crossed the pontifical\r\nborder, scattered the papal army, and took possession of all the papal\r\nterritory, except the city of Rome and the country immediately about it,\r\nand then marched on across the Neapolitan boundary. Here the Bourbon\r\narmy was holding Garibaldi at bay. The arrival of the Piedmontese\r\ndetermined the issue. A less noble man might have shown resentment at\r\nhaving another come at the eleventh hour and seize the fruits of\r\nvictory, but Garibaldi hailed Victor Emmanuel as King of Italy, refused\r\nthe proffered honours and rewards, and went home, a poor man, to the\r\nlittle island of Caprera. The Two Sicilies and the liberated parts of\r\nthe Papal States voted to join the Kingdom of Italy. In February, 1861,\r\nthe first Italian parliament was held, and Victor Emmanuel formally\r\nreceived the title King of Italy. Excepting Rome and Venice, Italy was\r\nfree and independent.\r\n\r\nRome was the more pressing question of the two. A history of twenty-five\r\nhundred years, a profound sentiment, a patriotic, poetic, romantic love,\r\nhad inevitably determined that Rome must be the capital of United Italy.\r\nOn the other hand, opposed to the Italian national sentiment was the\r\nhistoric Catholic sentiment, diffused throughout Europe and strongest in\r\nFrance. The Pope naturally deemed his Italian birth inferior in\r\nobligation to his Catholic position. Moreover, the Temporal Power of the\r\nPopes had endured for more than a thousand years, and since the time of\r\nJulius II the pontifical title had been as good as the title to public\r\nor private property anywhere. Catholics honestly believed that this\r\npolitical kingdom was necessary to the independence of the Church. How\r\ncould the world, they said, believe in papal impartiality if the Papacy\r\nwere under the thumb of the Italian government? The difference in point\r\nof view inevitably brought the ardent Papist and the patriotic\r\nNationalist to mutual injustice. The Italians looked on Pius IX as their\r\nworst enemy; the Roman Curia deemed the Italians robbers. French\r\nsympathy with the Papists, and especially the presence of a French army\r\nin Rome, made the question exceedingly difficult. A special\r\ncircumstance aggravated the difficulty. The King of Naples, having taken\r\nrefuge in Rome, armed and subsidized gangs of brigands, who raided the\r\nNeapolitan provinces and committed unspeakable outrages. These rascals,\r\nwhen pursued by the Piedmontese army, crossed the pontifical border and\r\nwere safe. This condition was intolerable.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the great statesman who had steadfastly pursued his\r\npolicy,--a free Church in a free State,--and never lost hope of a\r\npeaceful solution of the Roman difficulty, died (June 6, 1861). The\r\npriest who shrived him was summoned to Rome, deprived of his parish,\r\nsuspended from his office, and sent to finish his days in a remote\r\nmonastery; so strongly did the Roman Court feel that Cavour and his\r\nabettors were wicked men.\r\n\r\nCavour's successors, Ricasoli and Rattazzi, with feebler gait, followed\r\nhis policy as best they could; but uncertainty and hesitation prevailed.\r\nThe two great questions, Rome and Venice, pressed for solution. The\r\nradicals clamored to have the Italian army march on Rome. Garibaldi's\r\nimpatience would not brook further inaction. He left his island home at\r\nCaprera, and betook himself to Sicily, crying, \"Rome or Death!\" With a\r\nlittle army of hot-tempered radicals he crossed into Calabria. The\r\nItalian government had no choice. Regular troops met Garibaldi at\r\nAspromonte, near Reggio, and bade him withdraw; he refused; shots were\r\nfired. Which side fired first is uncertain. Garibaldi was wounded and\r\nmade prisoner (August 29, 1862). This indignity to the national hero\r\nroused much hard feeling, but reasonable men perceived that the solution\r\nof the Roman question had to be found in some other way than by a\r\nfilibustering expedition against a city held by the troops of a power\r\nwith whom the nation was at peace.\r\n\r\nThe liberation of Venice came first. Prussia occupied a position in\r\nGermany somewhat similar to that of Piedmont in Italy. Both had somewhat\r\nsimilar problems. Both felt antagonism to Austria, and also a suspicion\r\nof France. In April, 1866, the two states made an alliance against\r\nAustria, who, fearing the combination, tried to break it by offering to\r\ncede Venetia to Italy if she would abandon the Prussian alliance. Victor\r\nEmmanuel refused, and war began in June. The Italians were beaten both\r\non land and sea, to their great mortification and chagrin. The crushing\r\nPrussian victory at Sadowa, however, forced Austria to accept the\r\nvictor's terms, including the cession of Venice. On November 7 Victor\r\nEmmanuel entered the city. Rome alone was left.\r\n\r\nGaribaldi made another desperate attempt, but was defeated by the French\r\nat Mentana (1867). Not by Italian victories, but in consequence of\r\nPrussian victories, the conquest of Rome was finally effected. The\r\nFrench were obliged to withdraw their garrison during the\r\nFranco-Prussian War, and then the Italian government, which, to the\r\nshame of ardent patriots, had so long forborne out of obedience to the\r\nwill of the French, gave notice to the world that it would annex Rome.\r\nAfter a useless call upon the Pope for peaceful surrender, Victor\r\nEmmanuel directed his army to march on the city. Real resistance was out\r\nof the question, but Pius IX had decided to yield only to force. On the\r\n20th of September, 1870, a breach was made in the wall near _Porta Pia_,\r\na few shots were fired, a few score soldiers killed and wounded, and the\r\nItalian army marched in and took possession of the city. A _plebiscite_\r\nwas held, and by a vote of 133,681 to 1507 the city voted to become a\r\npart of Italy. In June, 1871, the seat of government was formally\r\nremoved from Florence, and Rome once again, after fifteen hundred years,\r\nbecame the capital of the Kingdom of Italy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] _The Union of Italy_, W. J. Stillman, p. 300.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION (1872-1900)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe union of Italy was so triumphant, the efforts which accomplished it\r\nso heroic, and the whole tone of Italian history throughout the\r\nRisorgimento so romantic and noble, that the period since of necessity\r\nlooks flat and dull. The Italians themselves had imagined that the union\r\nof Italy would be followed by some career, political, moral, or\r\nintellectual, that would be comparable to the career of ancient Rome. A\r\nreaction was inevitable. No nation could continue at so enthusiastic a\r\npitch. Moreover, the difficulties before it were great.\r\n\r\nChief of these difficulties was the persistent hostility of the Papacy.\r\nPius IX, a kind, lovable, timid man, wholly inadequate to cope with a\r\nrevolutionary situation, had passed from his early sympathy with the\r\nliberal movement to the opposite extreme, and hated it with the hatred\r\nof fear. His hatred of liberal ideas may be seen in his conduct with\r\nregard to ecclesiastical matters. He insisted upon the extremest\r\nconservative dogma, as if it were a shield to protect the Papacy, the\r\npapal city, the Papal States, and the whole Catholic world, from all\r\nassaults of Satan and his liberal crew. First he proclaimed the dogma of\r\nthe Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, next he published the\r\n\"Syllabus,\" which is a condemnation of all those doctrines commonly\r\nembodied in Bills of Rights. Finally, he convoked the Vatican Council\r\n(1869-70), and procured a decree that the Pope is infallible in matters\r\nof faith and morals. This decree gave the death-blow to whatever remains\r\nof republicanism there were in the Church, and established the Pope as\r\nabsolute monarch. An Ecumenical Council, representing the Church, had\r\npreviously been the infallible head of the Church; now the Pope was\r\nsubstituted for the Council.\r\n\r\nIn this way the Church more and more assumed an attitude of\r\nirreconcilable hostility to the ideas that prevailed among the educated\r\nclasses in Italy. After the occupation of Rome by the Italian\r\ngovernment, Pius shut himself up in the Vatican palace and proclaimed\r\nhimself a prisoner. He first advised and then commanded Catholics to\r\nstay away from the polls at national elections, and directed his foreign\r\npolicy to the end of reestablishing his Temporal Power. This policy,\r\njudged by the popular belief in the divine right of nationality and of\r\nmajorities, is of course wrong; judged by one who regards the interests\r\nof the Church as paramount, it may be defended as an attempt to adhere\r\nto the old ways under which the Catholic Church had played its\r\nextraordinary part in European history. After the occupation of Rome the\r\nItalian government passed the Law of Guarantees (May 10, 1871), which\r\nguaranteed to the Pope an annual subsidy of somewhat more than 3,000,000\r\nlire a year, and also the personal and diplomatic rights of a sovereign,\r\nsuch as to maintain his court, to receive ambassadors, to have separate\r\npostal and telegraph service, to keep the Vatican and Lateran palaces,\r\netc. Pius IX refused to accept the subsidy.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty, which has confronted the government since the union,\r\nhas been the discord between the North and South. The northern\r\nprovinces, especially Lombardy and Piedmont, have been making progress\r\nin manufactures and in commerce; whereas, on the contrary, the South,\r\nvery ignorant and very poor, and devoted to agriculture, wine, grain,\r\nlemons, oranges, etc., without facilities for manufacture and without\r\ncapacity for commerce, has made doubtful advance. Special causes have\r\nhindered it. In Sicily, in consequence of long-continued poverty,\r\nignorance, and misgovernment, the secret societies, known as the\r\n_Mafia_, have overrun great parts of the island. The original cause of\r\nthe _Mafia_ was probably self-protection, the lower classes banding\r\ntogether to save themselves from the oppressions of the upper classes\r\nwho clung to the remains of the feudal system. The landowners, for\r\nexample, had used their control of the courts to maintain privileges and\r\ninjustice. As a natural consequence, members of the _Mafia_ deemed it\r\nignoble to revenge wrongs by judicial process, and still more ignoble to\r\ngive any information to any officers of the government. They settled\r\ntheir own disputes and righted their own wrongs. With the grant of\r\nsuffrage the _Mafia_ became a political power, and only permitted the\r\nelection of such candidates as it approved.\r\n\r\nIn Naples there was also a power behind the scenes which resembled the\r\n_Mafia_, but in reality was totally distinct and individual. This\r\nNeapolitan power, a legacy from Bourbon times, was the _Camorra_, a\r\nsociety of criminals or ruffians on the edge of crime, organized for the\r\npurpose of levying tribute by blackmail; it was not unlike the worst\r\nmunicipal rings in this country, and gained its livelihood from the\r\nvicious, and from politicians who benefited by its support. Both\r\n_Camorra_ and _Mafia_ have been very great obstacles to social progress,\r\nand still exist.\r\n\r\nThe North, conscious of a higher standard of civilization, has wished to\r\neducate and reform the South, and also, perhaps, has not been unwilling\r\nto let taxation fall more heavily in proportion upon the agricultural\r\nproduce of the South than on the manufactured products of the North.\r\nResenting this assumption of superiority, and suspicious of unfair\r\ntreatment, especially with regard to indirect taxation, the South has\r\nfelt itself aggrieved; and so there have been continual misunderstanding\r\nand friction between it and the North.\r\n\r\nIn its foreign relations the country has also had hard problems. France\r\nand Italy ceased to be friends. Italy could not forget that the French\r\nhad upheld the papal power in Rome, and had defeated Garibaldi at\r\nMentana; and France was indignant that Italy had not come to her rescue\r\nin 1870. France also was jealous of a rival in the Mediterranean; while\r\nthe Italians believed that France favoured a revival of the Temporal\r\nPower. This unfriendliness, fostered by the Italian clericals,\r\nconstituted a most disturbing factor in Italy's foreign relations. The\r\nbreach was increased by other causes, and Italy in alarm turned to find\r\nfriends elsewhere. Austria and Germany, who had already made an\r\nalliance, were glad to have Italy join, as further security for the\r\npeace of Europe against any action by France or Russia. So the three\r\njoined and made the Triple Alliance (1882), which was renewed from time\r\nto time and still exists. This alliance has given Italy ample security\r\nagainst any attack by France, but has imposed upon her very heavy\r\nmilitary burdens in order to keep her army at a certain standard of\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nAs time went on the actors of the great age dropped off one by one;\r\nMazzini in 1872, Victor Emmanuel in 1878, Garibaldi in 1882. It is after\r\ntheir departure, their noble desires fulfilled, their noble tasks\r\naccomplished, that Italy looks little and inadequate. The parliamentary\r\nstruggles have certainly been neither noble nor romantic. After the\r\noccupation of Rome, the Right, the conservative party, under Marco\r\nMinghetti, Quintino Sella, and others, was in power for half a dozen\r\nyears, and by means of a burdensome taxation succeeded in making\r\nreceipts equal expenses. But taxes and refusal to extend the suffrage\r\nled to its fall from power, and the Left, the progressive party, under\r\nAgostino Depretis, assumed the government. Depretis abolished an\r\nunpopular tax on grinding corn, made primary education compulsory, and\r\nextended the suffrage from 600,000 voters to 2,000,000. After these\r\nreforms the dominant party ceased to have a definite programme. There\r\nwas general confusion, known as Transformism. The deputies split up into\r\nlittle groups under petty leaders and fell to log-rolling. The story is\r\ndreary and unimportant.\r\n\r\nDepretis, who died in 1887, was succeeded by Francesco Crispi, the most\r\nstriking political figure since Cavour. Crispi began life as an advocate\r\nat Palermo, and took part as a very young man in the early agitations\r\nfor constitutional reforms. He was successful at the bar, and had moved\r\nto Naples to practise before the appellate tribunals there, when the\r\nevents that led to the uprisings of '48 began to effervesce. Crispi took\r\na leading part. After the uprisings had been suppressed, he lived in\r\nexile till the time was ripe to begin again. Then he returned to Sicily\r\nand plotted for the revolution which terminated in Garibaldi's\r\nexpedition. He acquired great influence, took his seat in the Italian\r\nparliament, and soon became leader of the radical Left. In spite of\r\nvicissitudes and a not unattacked reputation, he was the chief\r\nparliamentary figure on the death of Depretis, and dominated Italian\r\npolitics till 1896. In his youth Crispi had been a follower of Mazzini's\r\nrepublican theories; later, though still a republican in sympathy, he\r\nannounced the opinion that \"the Republic would divide us, the Monarchy\r\nunites us,\" and abandoned his old republican associates. For this reason\r\namong others he incurred the animosity of old friends and allies.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of his ascendency the subdivision of the deputies into\r\nlittle groups made government difficult, and for a couple of years he\r\nwas out of office. In that interval hard times, adding weight to\r\nrepublican and socialist propaganda, caused strikes, riots, and\r\ninsurrections; and accompanying these disturbances came the \"Bank\r\nScandals.\" Sundry banks, conspicuously the important Banca Romana, had\r\nbeen violating the laws which regulated the government of banks, and had\r\nbeen engaged in most improper dealings with politicians, as, for\r\ninstance, lending money to deputies on little or no security. These\r\nscandals, together with the strikes, wrecked the ministry, and the\r\ncountry called on Crispi, as the one strong man able to take control. He\r\nassumed office in December, 1893, and remained till 1896, when he fell\r\nwith equal suddenness. The cause of his fall requires a separate\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\nAbout 1870 an Italian steamship company established a coaling station on\r\nthe west coast of the Red Sea, and acquired a certain strip of land\r\nwhich it afterwards ceded to the government (1882). From this beginning\r\nthe Italian government advanced, upon one pretext or another, to the\r\nestablishment of a colonial dependency. It occupied Massawa, established\r\nthe \"Colonia Erithrea,\" and proclaimed a zone of influence along the\r\neast coast of Africa. Various battles were fought with the natives; and\r\nat last the government sent fifteen thousand men to perform some\r\nbrilliant exploit for its own political benefit. The Italian troops were\r\nbadly handled; they walked into a trap set by the Abyssinians, and\r\nsuffered a terrible rout, losing half their numbers (1896). Crispi fell\r\nat once, and the new ministry under Di Rudini, in spite of cries for\r\nrevenge, prudently abandoned the colonial policy, and made peace as best\r\nit could. Italy renounced her protectorate, and contented herself with a\r\nstrip of coast by Massawa. Thus ended the scheme of colonial\r\naggrandizement begun in ignorance and folly.\r\n\r\nThe fall of Crispi removed the last interesting figure of the\r\nRisorgimento, and left Italian politics in a confused medley. Since\r\nthen, various leaders of no marked ability or individuality have\r\nstruggled with the permanent difficulties of Church and State, North and\r\nSouth, capitalism and socialism, and the shifting difficulties of\r\nforeign relations. All this time is too near to present any definite\r\npattern to the casual eye. The century closed sadly with the\r\nassassination of King Humbert (1878-1900) by an ignorant workman who\r\ncalled himself a nihilist. Humbert was not a good ruler, but he had a\r\nkind heart and many pleasant qualities, which endeared him to the\r\nItalian people. He was succeeded by his son Victor Emmanuel III, the\r\npresent king.\r\n\r\nThe greatest Italian figure of the last decades of the nineteenth\r\ncentury was not to be found in the service of the State, but of the\r\nChurch. In 1810 Gioacchino Pecci was born in Carpineto, a dead little\r\nvillage perched on a hillside near Anagni, the town where Boniface VIII\r\nwas nearly murdered by Sciarra Colonna five hundred years before. His\r\nfather, Count Lodovico Pecci, had served in Napoleon's army; his mother\r\nwas said to be descended from Cola di Rienzo. The count was the\r\nseigneur of the place, and lived in a somewhat shabby palace which had\r\nseen better days. Gioacchino was educated at a Jesuit school in Rome. He\r\nsoon gave evidence of marked ability, and was taken into the papal\r\nservice and sent as apostolic delegate to Benevento. Banditti infested\r\nthe neighbourhood, and the nobility of the town were little better than\r\nthe banditti. Pecci displayed character. He was promoted, and at the age\r\nof thirty-three was sent as papal nuncio to Belgium, with the title of\r\nArchbishop of Damietta, an archbishopric that had been _in partibus\r\ninfidelium_ since the days of St. Louis. In Belgium, where liberal ideas\r\nwere jostling the old ecclesiastical system, Pecci distinguished himself\r\nfor tact and address. From Belgium he went to Perugia as bishop, and\r\ngoverned the city for thirty-two years, during the trying time in which\r\n(largely at the expense of the Church) Italy was forcing her way to\r\nfreedom. In 1860 his authority was overthrown by the Piedmontese\r\nsoldiers, and many tales of brutality and wantonness charged upon the\r\nnationalists were brought to his troubled ears, and he unfortunately\r\nreceived a most unfavourable impression of liberals and liberalism. His\r\nreputation for ability, character, and diplomacy became so well\r\nestablished, that in the conclave on the death of Pius IX he had no\r\nserious competitor. Leo XIII (1878-1903) was already an old man when he\r\nwas elected Pope, and had had the misfortune to receive his education\r\nand training in the narrow school of the old papal regime. Preceded by\r\nan incompetent Pope, he found himself confronted by the wreck of the\r\nTemporal Power, and by a liberalism which was not only triumphant in\r\nItaly, but in nearly all western Europe. He had not far to go to find\r\nthoughtful men who expected to see the Papacy collapse and die. Most\r\ndifficult matters in Germany, in Ireland, in France, in the United\r\nStates, required delicate and skilful management. It is not too much to\r\nsay that Leo raised the Papacy higher in the world's regard than it had\r\nstood for two hundred years. Had he been a younger man, and trained in a\r\nmore liberal school, he might, perhaps, have attempted the task of\r\nadjusting ecclesiastical conservatism and tradition to the needs of a\r\nfast changing world. But he was too old. With a few brilliant exceptions\r\nhe accepted the conservative policy. He affected to deem himself a\r\nprisoner in the Vatican, and claimed the restoration of the Temporal\r\nPower; he declared Thomas Aquinas the best teacher for the priesthood,\r\nand stood firm on the dogmas of the Council of Trent. Nevertheless, his\r\nwas a most impressive personality, and he stands in the long list of\r\nPopes in a rank inferior only to the highest.\r\n\r\nIn his old age, as he strolled in the Vatican gardens, meditating Latin\r\nverses, or thinking over his encyclical letters, \"On the Condition of\r\nthe Working Classes,\" \"On Christian Democracy,\" \"On the Holy Eucharist,\"\r\nor turning his emaciated, sweet, Voltairean face to the great dome of\r\nSt. Peter's, he may well have let his mind wander in peace over the\r\noutside world, for never since Luther cast off his papal allegiance had\r\nthe whole Christian world been so united in admiration for a Pope of\r\nRome. All Christians could say amen to the prayer in his last poem,\r\n\"Suprema Leonis Vota:\"--\r\n\r\n    Expleat o clemens anxia vota Deus,\r\n\r\n    Scilicet ut tandem superis de civibus unus\r\n    Divino aeternum lumine et ore fruar.[25]\r\n\r\nWe have now reached our goal, the end of the nineteenth century, and if\r\nwe look back and contemplate the vicissitudes of Italy, such as no other\r\nnation ever experienced, twice on the throne of Europe, three times\r\ncrowned with its crown,--Imperial, Ecclesiastical, Intellectual,--and\r\nresurvey the three centuries during which foreign tyrant and native\r\npriest joined hands to smother and quench the Italian fire, and then\r\nread in detail the heroic acts of the men who sacrificed themselves for\r\nItalian freedom, we shall feel sure that the dull colours of the present\r\ngeneration are but signs of a time of rest, and that the genius of Italy\r\nlives within and will again enrich the world with deeds of men sprung\r\nfrom the \"gentle Latin blood.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25]\r\n\r\n Fulfil, O gracious God, my anxious prayer,\r\n\r\n That, at the last, one among the citizens of Heaven\r\n I may enjoy Thy Light, Thy Face, forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nCHRONOLOGICAL TABLE OF POPES AND EMPERORS\r\n\r\n\r\n  ----------+--------------------------+--------------------------+----------\r\n  Year of   |                          |                          |Year of\r\n  Accession.|        Popes.            |        Emperors.         |Accession.\r\n  ----------+--------------------------+--------------------------+----------\r\n    A.
