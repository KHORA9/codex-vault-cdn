When, however, I came seriously\r\nto consult the authorities I had marked out, and to arrange my ideas\r\npreparatory to writing it, I found the whole subject in such a state\r\nof confusion and uncertainty as to be wholly unsuited for introduction\r\ninto a work, the main object of which was to give a clear but succinct\r\naccount of what was known and admitted with regard to the architectural\r\nstyles of the world. Again, ten years afterwards, while engaged in\r\nre-writing this 'Handbook' as a 'History of Architecture,' the same\r\ndifficulties presented themselves. It is true that in the interval\r\nthe Druids, with their Dracontia, had lost much of the hold they\r\npossessed on the mind of the public; but, to a great extent, they had\r\nbeen replaced by prehistoric myths, which, though free from their\r\nabsurdity, were hardly less perplexing. The consequence was that then,\r\nas in the first instance, it would have been necessary to argue every\r\npoint and defend every position. Nothing could be taken for granted,\r\nand no narrative was possible. The matter was, therefore, a second\r\ntime allowed quietly to drop without being noticed. I never, however,\r\nlost sight of the subject, and I hoped some time or other to be able\r\nto treat of it with the fulness its interest deserves; and in order\r\nto forward this project, in July, 1860, I wrote an article in the\r\n'Quarterly Review,' entitled 'Stonehenge,' in which I stated the views\r\nI had then formed on the subject; and again, ten years afterwards, in\r\nApril of last year, another article, entitled 'Non-Historic Times' in\r\nthe same journal, in which I added such new facts and arguments as I\r\nhad gathered in the interval. The principal object it was sought to\r\nattain in writing these articles, was to raise a discussion on the moot\r\npoints which I hoped would have tended towards settling them. If any\r\ncompetent archæologist had come forward, and could have pointed out the\r\nweak point in the argument, he would have rendered a service to the\r\ncause; or if any leading authority had endorsed the views advocated in\r\nthese articles, the public might have felt some confidence in their\r\ncorrectness. This expectation has not been fulfilled, but they have\r\nprobably not been without their use in preparing the minds of others\r\nfor the views advanced in them, while, as no refutation has appeared,\r\nand no valid objection has been urged against them, either in public\r\nor in private, I may fairly consider myself justified in feeling\r\nconsiderable confidence in their general correctness.\r\n\r\nTill antiquaries are agreed whether the circles are temples or tombs\r\nor observatories, whether the dolmens are monuments of the dead or\r\naltars for sacrificing living men, and whether the mounds are tombs\r\nor law courts, it seems impossible, without arguing every point, to\r\nwrite anything that will be generally accepted. Still more, till it\r\nis decided whether they are really prehistoric or were erected at\r\nthe periods where tradition and history place them, it seems in vain\r\nto attempt to explain in a simple narrative form either their age or\r\nuses. As a necessary consequence of all this confusion, it is scarcely\r\npracticable at present to compile a work which shall be merely a\r\nHistorical and Statistical account of the Rude Stone Monuments in all\r\nparts of the world; but till something is settled and agreed upon, we\r\nmust be content with one which to a certain extent, at least, takes the\r\nform of an argument. Many of its pages which would have been better\r\nemployed in describing and classifying, are occupied with arguments\r\nagainst some untenable theory or date, or in trying to substitute\r\nfor those usually accepted, some more reasonable proposition.\r\nNotwithstanding this, however, it is hoped that this work will be\r\nfound to contain a greater number of new facts regarding Rude Stone\r\nMonuments, and of carefully selected illustrations extending over a\r\nlarger area, than have yet been put together in a volume of the same\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may fairly be asked, and no doubt will, how I dare to set up my\r\nopinions with regard to these monuments in opposition to those of\r\nthe best informed antiquaries, not only in this country but on the\r\nContinent? The answer I would venture to suggest is, that no other\r\nantiquary, so far as I am aware, has gone so carefully and fully into\r\nthe whole subject, or has faced all the difficulties with which the\r\nquestions are everywhere perplexed. The books that have hitherto been\r\nwritten are either the work of speculative dreamers, like Stukeley,\r\nHiggins, or Vallancey, who having evolved a baseless theory out of\r\ntheir own inner consciousness, seek everywhere for materials to prop\r\nit up, and are by no means particular as to the inferences they draw\r\nfrom very obscure or slender hints: or they are, on the other hand,\r\nthe works of local antiquaries, whose opinions are influenced mainly\r\nby what they find in their own researches. The works of such men are\r\ninvaluable as contributions to the general stock of knowledge, but\r\ntheir theories must be received with caution, as based on too narrow\r\na foundation either of facts or inferences; for it need hardly be\r\ninsisted upon that no amount of local experience can qualify any one\r\nto write on such a subject as this. It does not even seem sufficient\r\nthat an author should be familiar with all the varieties of megalithic\r\nremains. Unless he has also mastered the other forms of architectural\r\nart, and knows in what manner and from what motives the styles of one\r\npeople are adopted from or influenced by that of another race, he will\r\nhardly be able to unravel the various tangled problems that meet him at\r\nevery step in such an investigation. When looked at, however, from the\r\nsame point of view, and judged by the same laws as other styles, that\r\nof the dolmen builders does not appear either mythical or mysterious.\r\nThey seem to be the works of a race of men actuated by the same motives\r\nand feelings as ourselves, and the phenomena of their arts do not seem\r\ndifficult of explanation.\r\n\r\nIt is because I have spent the greater part of my life in studying\r\nthe architecture of all nations, and through all ages, that I believe\r\nmyself entitled to express an opinion on the perplexed questions\r\nconnected with megalithic remains, though it differs widely from that\r\ngenerally received, and that I dare to face the objection which is sure\r\nto be raised that my work is based on too narrow an induction, and that\r\nI have overlooked the evidences of primæval man which exist everywhere.\r\nIt is not, however, that I have neglected either the evidence from\r\nthe drift, or from the caves, but that I have rejected them as\r\nirrelevant, and because I can hardly trace any connexion between\r\nthem and the megalithic remains, to the investigation of which this\r\nwork is specially devoted. I have also purposely put on one side all\r\nreference to hut circles, Picts' houses, brochs, and other buildings\r\ncomposed of smaller stones, which are generally mixed up with the big\r\nstone monuments. I have done this, not because I doubt that many of\r\nthese may be coeval, but because their age being doubtful also, it\r\nwould only confuse and complicate the argument to introduce them, and\r\nbecause, whenever the age of the great stones is determined these minor\r\nmonuments will easily fit into their proper places. At present, neither\r\ntheir age or use throws any light either for or against that of the\r\ngreat stones.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be remarked, to anyone who knows anything about the\r\nsubject, that the difficulties in the way of writing such a book as\r\nthis are enormous, and I do not believe any one could, in a first\r\nedition at all events, avoid all the pitfalls that surround his path.\r\nThe necessary information has to be picked up in fragments from some\r\nhundreds of volumes of travels, or the Transactions and Journals of\r\nlearned Societies, none of which are specially devoted to the subject,\r\nand very few of which are indexed, or have any general résumé of their\r\ncontents. Add to this that the older works are all untrustworthy,\r\neither from the theories they are twisted to support, or from bad\r\ndrawing or imperfect knowledge; and too many of the modern examples are\r\ncarelessly sketched and still more carelessly engraved. Another source\r\nof difficulty is, that it is rare with readers of papers and writers in\r\njournals to quote references, and sometimes when these are given they\r\nare wrong. I have thus been forced to limit the field from which my\r\ninformation is taken very considerably. I have tried hard to introduce\r\nno illustration I could not thoroughly depend upon, and I have not\r\nintentionally quoted a single reference I had not verified from the\r\noriginal authorities.\r\n\r\nIn one respect I cannot but feel that I may have laid myself open to\r\nhostile criticism. On many minor points I have offered suggestions\r\nwhich I do not feel sure that I could prove if challenged, and which,\r\nconsequently, a more prudent man would have left alone. I have done\r\nthis because it often happens that such suggestions turn the attention\r\nof others to points which would otherwise be overlooked, and may lead\r\nto discoveries of great importance; while if disproved, they are only\r\nso much rubbish swept out of the path of truth, and their detection can\r\ndo no harm to any one but their author. Whatever my shortcomings, I am\r\ntoo much in earnest to look forward with any feelings of dismay to such\r\na contingency.\r\n\r\nBesides the usual motives which prompt the publication of such a work\r\nas this, there are two which seem to render its appearance at this time\r\nparticularly desirable. The first is to promote enquiry by exciting\r\ninterest in the subject; the second is to give precision to future\r\nresearches. So long as everything is vague and mythical, explorers do\r\nnot know what to observe or record: this work, however, presents a\r\ndistinct and positive view of the age or use of the megalithic remains,\r\nand every new fact must tend either to upset or confirm the theory it\r\nseeks to establish. With this view, I need hardly add that I shall\r\nbe extremely grateful for any new facts or additional sources of\r\ninformation which may be communicated to me, either through the public\r\npress or privately. Numerous persons having local experience must know\r\nmany things which may have escaped me. It is very probable that these\r\nmay induce me to modify some of the details of this work; but so much\r\nis now known, and the field from which my inductions are gathered is so\r\nwide, that I have no fear that they will touch the main arguments on\r\nwhich the theory of this work is founded.[1]\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, I trust that this work may lay claim to being, in\r\none respect at least, a contribution to the cause of truth regarding\r\nthe much-disputed age and use of these Rude Stone Monuments. It states\r\ndistinctly and without reserve one view of the mooted question, and so\r\nopenly that any one who knows better can at once pull away the prop\r\nfrom my house of cards and level it with the ground. If one thing comes\r\nout more clearly than another in the course of this investigation, it\r\nis that the style of architecture to which these monuments belong is a\r\nstyle, like Gothic, Grecian, Egyptian, Buddhist, or any other. It has\r\na beginning, a middle, and an end; and though we cannot yet make out\r\nthe sequence in all its details, this at least seems clear--that there\r\nis no great hiatus; nor is it that one part is prehistoric, while the\r\nother belongs to historic times. All belong to the one epoch or to the\r\nother. Either it is that Stonehenge and Avebury and all such are the\r\ntemples of a race so ancient as to be beyond the ken of mortal man,\r\nor they are the sepulchral monuments of a people who lived so nearly\r\nwithin the limits of the true historic times that their story can\r\neasily be recovered. If this latter view is adopted, the whole, it\r\nappears to me, hangs so perfectly together, and presents so complete\r\nand so rational an account of all the local or historical facts which\r\nare at present known concerning these remains, that I feel great\r\nconfidence that it must eventually be adopted as the true explanation\r\nof the phenomena. If it is it will have this further advantage, that\r\nwhen any serious attempt is made to investigate either the history or\r\nthe manners and customs of these ancient peoples, it is probable that\r\nthese megalithic remains will be found to be the best and surest guide.\r\n\r\nFrom the circumstances above detailed, this work would have been a\r\nmuch more meagre production than it is hoped it will be found, had\r\nit not been for the kindness of many friends who have assisted me in\r\nmy undertaking. My chapter on Ireland, for instance, would have been\r\nmuch less full had not Sir W. Wilde, Mr. Eugene Conwell, and Mr. Moore\r\nassisted me with illustrations and information; and for my knowledge of\r\nScotch antiquities I owe much to my friend John Stuart, of Edinburgh,\r\nwhile Sir Henry Dryden's invaluable collections have been of the utmost\r\nservice to me both as regards Scotland and Brittany. Professor Säve\r\nand Mr. Hildebrand have materially aided me in Sweden, and M. Riaño\r\nin Spain; but the post apparently suppresses any correspondence on\r\narchæological subjects with France and Denmark. Without the kindness\r\nof Sir Bartle Frere and his elder brother in lending me drawings, or\r\nColonel Collinson in procuring information, my account of the Maltese\r\nantiquities would have been very much less satisfactory than it is; and\r\nI also owe my best thanks to Mr. Walhouse, of the Madras Civil Service,\r\nand Mr. Burgess, of Bombay, for their assistance in respect to Indian\r\nantiquities. I have tried in the text to acknowledge my obligations to\r\nthese and all other parties who have assisted me. If I have omitted\r\nany, I trust they will believe it has not been intentionally, but\r\nthrough inadvertence.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I hope I may be allowed to plead that I have spared no\r\npains in investigating the materials placed at my disposal, and no\r\nhaste in forming my conclusions; and I may also add, they are by no\r\nmeans those of predilection or that I wished to arrive at. When I\r\nfirst took up the subject, I hoped that the rude stone monuments would\r\nprove to be old,--so old, indeed, as to form the \"incunabula\" of other\r\nstyles, and that we might thus, by a simple process, arrive at the\r\ngenesis of styles. Bit by bit that theory has crumbled to pieces as my\r\nknowledge increased, and most reluctantly have I been forced to adopt\r\nthe more prosaic conclusions of the present volume. If, however, this\r\nrepresents the truth, that must be allowed to be an ample compensation\r\nfor the loss of any poetry which has hitherto hung round the mystery of\r\nthe Rude Stone Monuments.\r\n\r\n_Langham Place, Dec. 1, 1871._\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: What is really wanted now is, a \"Megalithic Monument\r\n    Publication Society.\" After the meeting of the Prehistoric Congress\r\n    at Norwich, a committee for this purpose was formed in conjunction\r\n    with the Ethnological Society. After several meetings everything\r\n    was arranged and settled, but, alas! there were no funds to meet\r\n    the necessary expenses, or, at least, risk of publication, and\r\n    the whole thing fell through.

Little more than forty years have elapsed since\r\nChampollion's discoveries enabled us to classify and understand\r\nthe wonderful monuments of the Nile Valley. The deciphering of the\r\ncuneiform characters has in like manner enabled us to arrange and affix\r\ndates to the temples and palaces of Babylon and Nineveh. Everything\r\nthat was built by the Greeks and the Romans has been surveyed and\r\nillustrated; and all the mediæval styles that arose out of them have\r\nbeen reduced to intelligible sequences. The rock-cut temples of India,\r\nand her still more mysterious dagobas, have been brought within the\r\ndomain of history, and, like those of Burmah, Cambodia, or China, shown\r\nto be of comparatively modern date. The monuments of Mexico and Peru\r\nmay be said still to defy those who are endeavouring to wrest their\r\nsecrets from them; but even for these a fairly approximate date has\r\nbeen obtained. But amidst all these triumphs of well-directed research\r\nthere still remains a great group of monuments at our own doors,\r\nregarding whose uses or dates opinions are nearly as much divided as\r\nthey were in the days of rampant empiricism in the last century. It is\r\ntrue that men of science do not now pretend to see Druids sacrificing\r\ntheir bleeding victims on the altar at Stonehenge, nor to be able to\r\ntrace the folds of the divine serpent through miles of upright stones\r\nat Carnac or at Avebury; but all they have yet achieved is simple\r\nunbelief in the popular fallacies, nor have they hitherto ventured\r\nto supply anything better to take their places. They still call the\r\ncircles temples, but without being able to suggest to what god they\r\nwere dedicated, or for what rites they were appropriate, and, when\r\nasked as to the age in which they were erected, can only reply in the\r\nwords of the song, that it was \"long long ago.\"\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs is eminently unsatisfactory, but at the same time\r\nto a great extent excusable. Indeed it is not at first sight easy to\r\nsee how it is to be remedied. The builders of the megalithic remains\r\nwere utterly illiterate, and have left no written records of their\r\nerection; nor are there any legible inscriptions on the more important\r\nmonuments which would afford any hints to the enquirer. What is even\r\nmore disheartening is that in almost every instance they are composed\r\nof rough unhewn stones, not only without any chisel marks, but even\r\nwithout any architectural mouldings capable of being compared with\r\nthose of other monuments, or, by their state of preservation, of giving\r\na hint as to their relative age.\r\n\r\n  \"They stand, but stand in silent and uncommunicative majesty.\"\r\n\r\nSo silent, indeed, that it is hardly to be wondered at that fanciful\r\nantiquaries have supplied them with voices most discordantly and\r\nabsurdly various, or, on the other hand, that the better class of\r\nenquirers have shrunk from the long patient investigations and\r\nthoughtful ponderings which are necessary to elicit even a modicum of\r\ntruth from their stolid reticence.\r\n\r\nIf the investigation into the age and uses of the megalithic remains\r\nwere a new subject which had for the first time been taken up some\r\nthirty or forty years ago, it is probable that a solution might have\r\nbeen obtained before now, or at all events would not be far off. When,\r\nhowever, an investigation gets into a thoroughly vicious groove, as\r\nthis one has done, it is very difficult to rescue it from its false\r\nposition. The careless are willing to accept any empirical solutions\r\nthat are offered, however absurd they may be, and the thoughtful are\r\ndeterred from meddling with an enquiry which has hitherto led only to\r\nsuch irrational conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe first of those who, in this country at least, led off the wild\r\ndance was the celebrated Inigo Jones, the architect of Whitehall. It\r\nseems that when King James I. was on a visit to the Earl of Pembroke\r\nat Wilton, he was taken to see Stonehenge, and was so struck with its\r\nmajesty and mystery that he ordered his architect to find out by whom\r\nit was built, and for what purpose. Whether the treatise containing the\r\nresult of his enquiries was ever submitted to the King is not clear. It\r\ncertainly was not published till after its author's death, and though\r\nit shows a very creditable amount of learning and research, the results\r\nhe arrived at were very startling. After a detailed statement of the\r\npremises, his conclusions--as condensed in the Life prefixed to his\r\ntreatise--were \"That it was a Roman temple, inscribed to Cœlus, the\r\nsenior of the heathen gods, and built after the Tuscan order.\"\r\n\r\nThis theory was attacked by Dr. Charleton, one of the physicians of\r\nCharles II. He had corresponded for some time with Olaus Wormius, the\r\ncelebrated Danish antiquary, and struck with the similarity in form and\r\nof construction that existed between the monuments in Denmark and those\r\nof this country, he came to the conclusion that Stonehenge and other\r\nsimilar monuments were erected by the Danes, and consequently after\r\nthe departure of the Romans. This attack on the theory of Inigo Jones\r\nraised the wrath of a Mr. Webb, by marriage a relative, who replied in\r\na very angry treatise, in which he reiterates all Jones's arguments,\r\nand then, adding a considerable number of his own, he concludes by\r\ntriumphantly--as he supposes--restoring Stonehenge to the Romans.[2]\r\n\r\nSo far no great harm was done; but Dr. Stukeley, who next appeared\r\nin the controversy, was one of the most imaginative of men and one\r\nof the wildest of theorists. His studies had made him familiar with\r\nthe Druids, whom classical authorities describe as the all-powerful\r\npriests of the Celtic race, but who had no temples; on the other hand,\r\nhis travels made him acquainted with Stonehenge and Avebury, to the\r\nlatter of which attention had just been called by the researches of his\r\nfriend Aubrey. Here, then, were temples without priests. What could\r\nbe so natural as to join these two, though in most unholy matrimony.\r\nOur stone circles must be temples of the Druids! But there was still\r\none difficulty. What divinities did they worship therein? Cæsar tells\r\nus that the Celts or Celtic Druids principally worshipped Mercury\r\nand some other Roman gods whom he named;[3] but no images of these\r\ngods are found in these temples, nor anything that would indicate a\r\ndedication to their worship. Unfortunately, however, Pliny[4] tells\r\na very silly tale, how in Gaul the snakes meet together on a certain\r\nday and manufacture from their spittle an egg (_Anguinum_), which,\r\nwhen complete, they throw aloft, and if any one wants it, he must\r\ncatch it in a blanket before it falls to the ground, and ride off with\r\nit on a fleet horse, for if the snakes catch him before he crosses a\r\nrunning stream, a worse fate than Tam o' Shanter's may befall him! He\r\nthen goes on to add that this egg was considered as a charm by the\r\nDruids. From this last hint Dr. Stukeley concluded that the Druids\r\nwere serpent-worshippers, and consequently that Stonehenge, Avebury,\r\n&c., were serpent temples--Dracontia, as he calls them, daringly\r\nassuming that a word, which in the singular was only the name of a\r\nplant, was actually applied by the ancients to serpent temples, of the\r\nform of which, however, they were as ignorant as the Doctor himself.\r\nHaving advanced so far, it only remained to adapt the English circles\r\nto this newly discovered form of worship, and Avebury was chosen as\r\nthe principal illustration. There was a small circle on Hakpen Hill,\r\nwhich had a stone avenue formed by six or eight stones running east\r\nand west; between West Kennet and Avebury there was another avenue\r\nleading to the circles, but trending north and south. By introducing\r\na curved piece between these fragments, Hakpen became the head of the\r\nsnake, the avenue its body; Avebury a convoluted part of it, and then\r\na tail was added, a mile long, on the authority of two stones in the\r\nvillage, and a dolmen, called Long Stone Cove, about halfway between\r\nAvebury and the end of the tail! Stanton Drew and other circles were\r\ntreated in the same way; curved avenues, for which there is not a\r\nshadow of authority, except in the Doctor's imagination, were added\r\nwherever required, and serpents manufactured wherever wanted. It never\r\nseems even to have occurred to the Doctor or his contemporaries to ask\r\nwhether, in any time or place, any temple was ever built in the form of\r\nthe gods to be worshipped therein or thereat, or how any human being\r\ncould discover the form of the serpent in rows of stones stretching\r\nover hills and valleys, crossing streams, and hid occasionally by\r\nmounds and earthworks. On a map, with the missing parts supplied, this\r\nis easy enough; but there were no maps in those days, and in the open\r\ncountry it would puzzle even the most experienced surveyors to detect\r\nthe serpent's form.\r\n\r\nHad so silly a fabrication been put forward in the present day,\r\nit probably would have met with the contempt it deserves; but the\r\nstrangest part of the whole is that it was then accepted as a\r\nrevelation. Even so steady and so well informed an antiquary as Sir\r\nRichard Colt Hoare adopts Dr. Stukeley's views without enquiry. His\r\nmagnificent works on 'Ancient and Modern Wiltshire,' which are not only\r\nthe most splendid, but the most valuable works of their class which\r\nthis country owes to the liberality and industry of any individual,\r\nare throughout disfigured by this one great blemish. He sees Druids\r\nand their Dragons everywhere, and never thinks of enquiring on what\r\nauthority their existence rests.\r\n\r\nIt is not of course for one moment meant to contend that there were\r\nnot Druids in Europe in ancient days. Cæsar's testimony on this point\r\nis too distinct, and his knowledge was too accurate to admit of any\r\ndoubt on this point. It is true, however, that the description of them\r\ngiven by Diodorus,[5] and Strabo,[6] who mix them up with the bards\r\nand soothsayers, detracts somewhat from the pre-eminence he assigns to\r\nthem: but this is of minor importance. The Druids were certainly the\r\npriests of the Celts, and had their principal seat in the country of\r\nthe Carnutes, near Chartres, where, however, megalithic remains are\r\nfew and far between. Neither Cæsar, however, nor any one else, ever\r\npretended to have seen a Druid in England. Suetonius met 'Druidæ'\r\nin the Island of Anglesea (Mona),[7] but none were ever heard of in\r\nWiltshire, or Derbyshire, or Cumberland, where the principal monuments\r\nare situated; nor in the Western Islands, or in Scandinavia. Still\r\nless are they known in Algeria or India, where these megalithic remains\r\nabound. According to the Welsh bards and Irish annalists, there were\r\nDruids in Wales and Ireland before the introduction of Christianity.\r\nBut, even admitting this, it does not help us much; as even there they\r\nare nowhere connected with the class of monuments of which we are now\r\ntreating. Indeed, it has been contended lately, and with a considerable\r\nshow of reason, that the Celts themselves, even in France, had nothing\r\nto do with these monuments, and that they belong to an entirely\r\ndifferent race of people.[8] It is not, in short, at all necessary\r\nto deny either the existence of the Druids or their power. The real\r\ndifficulty is to connect them in any way, directly or indirectly, with\r\nthe stone monuments: and it seems still more difficult to prove that\r\nthe Celts ever worshipped the serpent in any shape or form.[9]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, in the present century, an educated gentleman\r\nand a clergyman of the Church of England, the Rev. Bathurst Deane,\r\nadopts unhesitatingly all that Stukeley and his school had put forward.\r\nHe took the trouble of going to Brittany, accompanied by a competent\r\nsurveyor, and made a careful plan of the alignments of Carnac.[10] Like\r\nthe avenues at Avebury, they certainly bore no resemblance to serpent\r\nforms, to eyes profane, but looked rather like two straight lines\r\nrunning nearly parallel to one another at a distance of about two miles\r\napart. But may not an intermediate curvilinear piece some three miles\r\nlong have existed in the gap and so joined the head to the tail? It is\r\nin vain to urge that no trace of it now exists, or to ask how any human\r\nbeing could trace the forms of serpents seven or eight miles long in an\r\nundulating country, and how or in what manner, or to what part of this\r\nstrange deity or monster, he was to address his prayers.\r\n\r\nIt would be incorrect, however, to represent all antiquaries as\r\nadopting the Ophite heresy. Another group have argued stoutly that\r\nStonehenge was an observatory of the British Druids. This theory was\r\napparently suggested by views published by Daniell and others of the\r\nobservatories erected by Jey Sing of Jeypore at Delhi, Ougein, Benares,\r\nand elsewhere in India. All these, it is true, possess great circles,\r\nbut each of all these circles contains a gnomon, which is as essential\r\na part of such an astronomical instrument as it is of a sun-dial, and\r\nno trace of such a feature, it need hardly be said, occurs in any\r\nBritish circle. One antiquary, who ought to be better informed,[11]\r\nconcluded that Stonehenge was an observatory, because, sitting on a\r\nstone called the Altar on a Midsummer morning, he saw the sun rise\r\nbehind a stone called the Friar's Heel. This is the only recorded\r\nobservation ever made there, so far as I know; and if this is all, it\r\nis evident that any two stones would have answered the purpose equally\r\nwell, and as the Altar stone is sixteen feet long, it allows a latitude\r\nof observation that augurs ill for the Druidical knowledge of the exact\r\nsciences. Neither Mr. Ellis, however, nor Dr. Smith, nor the Rev. Mr.\r\nDuke,[12] nor indeed any of those who have taken up the astronomical\r\ntheory, have yet pointed out one single observation that could be made\r\nby these circles that could not be made as well or better without\r\nthem. Or, if they were orreries, as is sometimes pretended, no one has\r\nexplained what they record or represent in any manner that would be\r\nintelligible to any one else. Till some practical astronomer will come\r\nforward and tell us in intelligible language what observations could be\r\nperformed with the aid of the circles of Stonehenge, we may be at least\r\nallowed to pause. Even, however, in that case, unless his theory will\r\napply to Avebury, Stanton Drew, and other circles so irregular as to be\r\nalmost unmeasurable, it will add little to our knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt might be an amusing, though it certainly must be a profitless,\r\ntask to enlarge on these and all the other guesses which have from\r\ntime to time been made with regard to these mysterious remains. It\r\nis not, however, probable that theories so utterly groundless will\r\nbe put forward again, or, if promulgated, that they will be listened\r\nto in future. The one excuse for them hitherto has been that their\r\nauthors have been deprived of all their usual sources of information\r\nin this matter. It is not too much to assert that there is not one\r\nsingle passage in any classical author which can be construed as\r\nalluding directly or indirectly to the megalithic remains on these\r\nisles or on the continent. With all their learning and industry, the\r\nantiquaries of the last century could only find one passage which, with\r\nall their misapplied ingenuity, they could pervert to their purposes.\r\nIt was this--in his second book, Diodorus, quoting from Hecatæus,\r\nmentions that in an island, not less in size than Sicily, and opposite\r\nto Celtica, there existed among the Hyperboreans a circular temple\r\nmagnificently adorned.[13] Stukeley and his followers immediately\r\njumped to the conclusion that the island not less than Sicily and\r\nopposite Gaul must be England, and the circular temple Stonehenge,\r\nwhich was consequently dedicated to Apollo and the serpent Python, and\r\nour forefathers were the Hyperboreans, and our intercourse with Greece\r\nclear and frequent. It is marvellous what a superstructure was raised\r\non such a basis. But against it may be urged that the whole of the\r\nsecond book of Diodorus is dedicated solely to a description of Asia.\r\nIn the preceding chapter he describes the Amazons, who, if they ever\r\nexisted, certainly lived in that quarter of the globe. In the following\r\nchapters he describes Arabia, and even in this one (xlvii.) he speaks\r\nof the Hyperboreans as inhabiting the northern parts of Asia. By the\r\nutmost latitude of interpretation we might assume this island to have\r\nbeen in the Baltic--Œsel probably, Gothland possibly, but certainly\r\nnot further west. It is impossible Diodorus could be mistaken in the\r\nmatter, for in his fifth book he describes the British Isles in their\r\nproper place, and with a very considerable degree of accuracy.[14] But,\r\nafter all, what does it amount to? In this island there was a circular\r\ntemple. We are not told whether it was of wood or of stone, whether\r\nhypæthral, or roofed, or vaulted, and certainly there is not a shadow\r\nof a hint that it was composed of a circle of rude stones like those in\r\nthis country with which the antiquaries of the last century tried to\r\nassimilate it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is little to be wondered at if all this rashness of speculation\r\nand carelessness in quotation should have produced a belief that the\r\nsolution of the problem was impossible from any literary or historical\r\ndata, or if consequently our modern antiquaries should have grasped\r\nwith avidity at a scheme, first proposed by the Danes, which seemed\r\nat all events to place the question on a scientific basis. No country\r\ncould well be more favourably situated for an enquiry of this sort than\r\nDenmark. It is rich in megalithic remains of all sorts. Its tumuli and\r\ntombs seem generally to have been undisturbed; and it was exceptionally\r\nfortunate in having a government with sufficient common sense to enact\r\na law of treasure-trove, so just and, at the same time, so liberal as\r\nto prevent all metal articles from finding their way to the melting\r\npot, and governors so intelligent as fully to appreciate the scientific\r\nvalue of these early remains. In consequence of all this, the museums\r\nat Copenhagen were soon filled with one of the richest collections of\r\nantiquities of this sort that was ever collected, and when brought\r\ntogether it was not difficult to perceive the leading features that\r\nconnected them in one continuous sequence.\r\n\r\nFirst it appeared that there was an age extending into far prehistoric\r\ntimes, when men used only implements of stone and bone, and were\r\nignorant of the use of any of the metals; then that an age had\r\nsucceeded to this when the use of bronze was known, and also probably\r\nthat of gold; and, lastly, that there was a third age, when iron had\r\nbeen introduced and had superseded the use of all other metals for\r\nweapons of war and utilitarian purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Danish antiquaries were somewhat divided in opinion as to the exact\r\nperiod when bronze was first introduced, some carrying it back as far\r\nas 2000 B.C., others doubting whether it was known in Denmark\r\nmore than 1000 or 1200 years B.C.; but all agreed that iron\r\nwas introduced about the Christian era. Having satisfied themselves on\r\nthese points, the Danish antiquaries proceeded at once to apply this\r\nsystem to the monuments of their country. Any tomb or tumulus which was\r\ndevoid of any trace of metal was dated at once at least 1000, probably\r\n2000, years before Christ, and might be 10,000, or 20,000 years old, or\r\neven still older. Any tomb containing bronze was at once set down as\r\ndating between the war of Troy and the Christian era; and if a trace\r\nof iron was detected, it was treated as subsequent to the last-named\r\nepoch, but still as anterior to the introduction of Christianity, which\r\nin Denmark dates about the year 1000 A.D.\r\n\r\nThis system seemed so reasonable and philosophical, compared with the\r\nwild theories of the British antiquaries of the last century, that it\r\nwas instantly adopted both in the country of its birth and in England\r\nand France; and the succession of the three ages--stone, bronze, and\r\niron--was generally looked upon as firmly established as any fact in\r\nchronology. Gradually, however, it has been perceived that the hard and\r\nfast line at first drawn between them cannot be maintained. At the last\r\nmeeting of the International Archæological Congress, held at Copenhagen\r\nin the autumn of 1869, it was admitted on all hands that there was\r\na considerable overlap between each of the three ages. Men did not\r\nimmediately cease to use stone implements when bronze was introduced;\r\nand bronze continued to be employed for many purposes after the use of\r\niron was well known.[15] Antiquaries have not yet made up their minds\r\nto what extent the overlap took place; but on its determination depends\r\nthe whole value of the scheme as a chronometric scale.\r\n\r\nIf the Danes, instead of breaking up their \"finds\" and distributing\r\nthem in cases according to a pre-conceived system, had kept and\r\npublished a careful record of the places where the contents of their\r\nmuseums were found, and in what juxtaposition, we should not probably\r\nbe in our present difficulty. Under the circumstances, it is perhaps\r\nfortunate that we had no central museum, but that our antiquaries have\r\npublished careful narratives of their proceedings. Sir Richard Colt\r\nHoare's great works are models of their class, but are scarcely to be\r\ndepended upon in the present instance, as the importance of flint\r\nand flint implements was not appreciated in his time to the extent\r\nit now is.[16] The explorations of the Messrs. Bateman in Derbyshire\r\nare more completely up to the mark of the science of the present day.\r\nA few extracts from one of their works will show how various and how\r\nmixed the contents of even a single group of tombs are, and will prove\r\nconsequently how little dependence can be placed on any one class of\r\nobjects to fix the age of these monuments.\r\n\r\nIn his 'Vestiges of the Antiquities of Derbyshire,' published in 1848\r\nby Thomas Bateman, we find the following among other interesting facts,\r\ntaking them as they are found arranged in his volume, without any\r\nattempt at classification:--\r\n\r\nOn Winster Moor (p. 20), a gold Greek cross--undoubtedly Christian,\r\nwith a fibula of the same metal richly ornamented, and a quantity of\r\nglass and metal ornaments.\r\n\r\nPegges Barrow (p. 24). Several Anglo-Saxon ornaments, most probably of\r\nthe seventh or eighth century.\r\n\r\nIn a barrow at Long Roods (p. 28) were found two urns, with calcined\r\nbones and a brass coin of Constantine, of the type \"Gloria exercitus.\"\r\n\r\nIn Haddon Field Barrow (p. 30) were found 82 brass coins: among them\r\nConstantine 9, Constans 17, Constantius II. 9, family of Constantine 3,\r\nUrbs Roma 1, Constantinopolis 2, Valentinian 5, Valens 12, Gratian 3.\r\nThe remainder illegible.\r\n\r\nAt Gib Hill, near Arbor Low (p. 31), of which more hereafter, there\r\nwere found a flint arrow-head 2½ inches long, and a fragment of a\r\nbasaltic celt; also a small iron fibula, and another piece of iron of\r\nindeterminable form.\r\n\r\nOn Cross Flatts (p. 35) the weapons found with the skeleton were an\r\niron knife, the blade 5 inches long; a piece of roughly chipped flint,\r\nprobably a spear-head; and a natural piece of stone of remarkable form.\r\nA similar iron knife and a stone celt were afterwards found within a\r\nfew yards of the barrow, probably thrown out and overlooked when first\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nIn Galley Lowe (p. 37), a very beautiful gold necklace set with\r\ngarnets, and a coin of Honorius; but towards the outer edge of the\r\nLowe, and consequently, as far as position goes, probably later,\r\nanother interment, accompanied with rude pottery, a small arrow-head of\r\ngrey flint, and a piece of ironstone.\r\n\r\nIn the great barrow at Minning Lowe (p. 39) were found coins of\r\nClaudius Gothicus, Constantine the Great, Constantine Junior, and\r\nValentinian.\r\n\r\nIn a smaller barrow close by were found fragments of a coarse,\r\ndark-coloured urn, a flint arrow-head, a small piece of iron, part of a\r\nbridle-bit, and several horses' teeth; lower down, a cist with an iron\r\nknife, with an iron sheath; and on the outer edge another interment,\r\naccompanied by a highly ornamented drinking-cup, a small brass or\r\ncopper pin, and a rude spear or arrow-head of dark grey flint.\r\n\r\nIn Borther Lowe (p. 48) were found a flint arrow-head much burnt and a\r\ndiminutive bronze celt.\r\n\r\nIn Rolley Lowe (p. 55) were found a brass coin of Constantine, and\r\na brass pin 2-3/4 inches long; and lower down a rude but highly\r\nornamented urn, and with it two very neat arrow-heads of flint of\r\nuncommon forms; and in another part of the barrow a spear-head of\r\ncoarse flint, with the fragments of an ornamented drinking-cup.\r\n\r\nIn a barrow on Ashford Moor (p. 57) were found, scattered in different\r\nparts, a small iron arrow-head and five instruments of flint.\r\n\r\nIn Carder Lowe (p. 63) were found several instruments of flint, amongst\r\nthe latter a neatly formed barbed arrow-head; and lower down, with the\r\nprimary interment, a splendid brass or bronze dagger; a few inches\r\nlower down a beautiful axe hammer-head of basalt. In another part of\r\nthe barrow another interment was discovered, accompanied by an iron\r\nknife and three hones of sandstone.\r\n\r\nA barrow was opened at New Inns (p. 66), where, along with the\r\nprincipal interment, was found a beautiful brass dagger, with smaller\r\nrivets than usual; and in another part a skeleton, with two instruments\r\nof flint, and some animal teeth.\r\n\r\nIn Net Lowe (p. 68), close to the right arm of the principal interment,\r\na large dagger of brass, with the decorations of its handle, consisting\r\nof thirty brass rivets; two studs of Kimmeridge coal. With the\r\nabove-mentioned articles were numerous fragments of calcined flint, and\r\namongst the soil of the barrow two rude instruments of flint.\r\n\r\nAt Castern (p. 73), in one part of the mound, an instrument was\r\nfound, with a fine spear-head of flint, and a small arrow-head of the\r\nsame. In other parts, but in apparently undisturbed earth, a circular\r\ninstrument, and various chippings of flint, and the handle of a knife\r\nof stag's horn, riveted in the usual way on to the steel. A similar one\r\nis figured in Douglas's 'Nenia Britannica,' plate 19, fig. 4, as found\r\nwith an interment in one of the barrows on Chartham Downs, Kent.\r\n\r\nIn Stand Lowe (p. 74), on digging towards the centre, numerous flint\r\nchippings and six rude instruments were found, and above the same place\r\na broken whetstone. The centre being gained, an iron knife was found\r\nof the kind generally attributed to the Saxons. This was immediately\r\nfollowed by a bronze box and a number of buckles, fibulæ, and articles\r\nof iron, silver, and glass, all showing the principal interment to have\r\nbeen of very late date. Mr. Bateman adds--\"the finding of instruments\r\nof flint with an interment of this comparatively modern description is\r\nrather remarkable, but by no means unprecedented.\"\r\n\r\nIn a barrow midway between Wetton and Ilam (p. 79) with the interment\r\nwere found three implements of flint of no great interest, some\r\nfragments of an ornamented urn, and an iron pin, similar to the awl\r\nused by saddlers at the present day. Mr. Bateman adds--\"one precisely\r\nsimilar was found in a barrow on Middleton Moor in 1824.\"\r\n\r\nIn a second barrow near the same place were found the remains of a\r\ncoarse and rudely ornamented urn with its deposit of burnt bones. A\r\nthird brass coin of Constantine the Great was also found on the summit,\r\njust under the surface.\r\n\r\nIn Come Lowe (p. 95), with an interment of a very late period, were\r\nfound gold and iron ornaments and glass beads, as well as the usual\r\nchippings of flint and rats' bones.\r\n\r\nIn Dowe Lowe (p. 96) the most remote interment consisted of two much\r\ndecayed skeletons lying on the floor of the barrow about two yards from\r\nits centre; one was accompanied by a fluted brass dagger placed near\r\nthe upper bone of the arm, and an amulet of iron ore with a large flint\r\nimplement, which had seen good service, lying near the pelvis.\r\n\r\nThe other tumuli examined by this indefatigable explorer either\r\ncontained objects generally of the same class or nothing that was of\r\ninterest as marking their age. If his other works, or those of others,\r\nwere abstracted in the same way, numerous examples of the same sort\r\nmight be adduced. The above, however, are probably sufficient to show\r\nhow little reliance can be placed on the hard and fast distinction\r\nbetween the flint, bronze, and iron ages which have hitherto been\r\nsupposed to govern every determination of age in this science. If in a\r\nhundred short pages of one man's work so many instances of overlapping,\r\nand, indeed, of reversal of the usual order of things, can be found, it\r\nis easy to understand how many might be added if other works were also\r\nexamined. All, however, that is wanted here is to show that the Danish\r\nsystem is neither perfect nor final, and that we must look for some\r\nother means of ascertaining the age of these monuments if we are to\r\ncome to a satisfactory conclusion regarding them.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that, though a tomb containing only stone and bone\r\nimplements may be 10,000 or 20,000 years old, unless it can also be\r\nshown that stone and bone were no longer used after the Christian era,\r\nit may also be as modern, or more so, than that epoch. Unless, also,\r\nit can be proved that stone implements were never used after iron was\r\nintroduced, or that bronze was never employed down to a late period,\r\nthis system is of no avail; and after the examples just quoted from the\r\nBateman diggings, it seems the merest empiricism to assume that the\r\nuse of each class of implements ceased on the introduction of another;\r\nand till it can be shown at what date their use did really cease,\r\nany argument based on their presence is of very little value. This,\r\nhowever, is a task to which no antiquary has yet applied himself; all\r\nhave been content to fix the age of the monuments from the assumed age\r\nof their contents, empirically determined. It is a far more difficult\r\ntask, however, to ascertain the age of the contents from that of the\r\nmonument in which they are found; it is a task that requires an\r\ninvestigation into the history and circumstances of each particular\r\nexample. With the scant materials that exist, this is by no means easy;\r\nbut as it seems the only mode by which truth can be arrived at, it is\r\nthe task to which we propose to devote the following pages; should it\r\nprove impossible, we may indeed despair.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how different would have been the fate of this\r\nscience, had the Scandinavians followed up the line of investigation\r\ncommenced by their writers in the sixteenth century. Olaus Magnus,\r\nfor instance, Archbishop of Upsala, writing in 1555, describes the\r\nmegalithic remains of Sweden with the sobriety and precision with which\r\na man in the present day might give an account of the cemeteries of\r\nKensal-green or of Scutari. Some, he tells us, marked battle-fields,\r\nsome family sepulchres, others the graves of greatly distinguished\r\nmen.[17] In like manner, Olaus Wormius, in 1643, describes the tombs\r\nof the kings of Denmark as a writer in the present day might the\r\nPlantagenet sepulchres in Westminster Abbey.[18] Neither have any\r\ndoubt or hesitation about the matter, and though Dr. Charleton was\r\nhasty in following this author too implicitly in applying his data to\r\nthis country, still, so far as I can form an opinion, if that line of\r\nresearch had been steadily followed out, there would now have been as\r\nlittle doubt about the age of Stonehenge, as there is about that of\r\nSalisbury Cathedral. Stukeley, however, cut the vessel adrift from the\r\nmoorings of common sense, and she has since been a derelict tossed\r\nabout by the winds and waves of every passing fancy, till recently,\r\nwhen an attempt has been made to tow the wreck into the misty haven of\r\nprehistoric antiquity. If ever she reaches that nebulous region, she\r\nmay as well be broken up in despair, as she can be of no further use\r\nfor human purposes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhether this will or will not be her fate must depend on the result\r\nof the new impulse which has within the last ten or twelve years been\r\ngiven to the enquiry. Hitherto it seems certainly to be in a direction\r\nwhich, it is to be feared, is not likely to lead to any greater degree\r\nof precision in the enquiry. While the Danish \"savans\" were arranging\r\ntheir collections in the museums at Copenhagen, M. Boucher de Perthes\r\nwas quietly forming a collection of flint implements from the drift\r\ngravels of the valley of the Somme, which far exceeded all hitherto\r\nfound in antiquity. For many years his discoveries were ridiculed and\r\nlaughed at, till in 1858 the late Hugh Falconer visited his museum at\r\nAbbeville, and being then fresh from his investigations at Kent's Hole\r\nand the Gower Caves,[19] he at once saw their value and proclaimed\r\nit to the world. Since then it has not been disputed that the flint\r\nimplements found in the valley of the Somme are the works of man, and\r\nthat from the position in which they are found their fabricators must\r\nhave lived at a period on the edge of the glacial epoch, and when\r\nthe configuration of the continent differed from what it now is, and\r\nwhen probably the British isles were still joined to France. Similar\r\nimplements have before and since been found in Suffolk,[20] and other\r\nparts of England in analogous circumstances, and all allied with a\r\nfauna which was extinct in these parts before historic times.[21] If\r\nyou ask a geologist how long ago the circumstances of the globe were\r\nsuch as these conditions represent, he will answer at once not less\r\nthan a million of years! But they deal in large figures, and it is not\r\nnecessary to investigate them now. It was a very long time ago.\r\n\r\nEven more interesting than these for our present purposes was the\r\ndiscovery a few years later of human remains in the valleys of the\r\nDordogne and other rivers of the south of France. Here geology does not\r\nhelp us, but climatology does. At that time the climate of the south\r\nof France was so cold that the inhabitants of these caves had all the\r\nhabits of people now dwelling in the Arctic regions. Their principal\r\ndomestic animal was the reindeer, but they were familiar with the\r\nwoolly-haired mammoth, the cave bear, and the aurochs. The climate was\r\nso cold that they could throw on one side the débris of their feasts,\r\nand floor their dwelling with marrow bones and offal without dreading\r\npestilence or even suffering inconvenience. They were, in fact, in\r\nevery respect, so far as we have the means of judging, identical with\r\nthe Esquimaux of the present day, and must have inhabited a climate\r\nnearly similar to that of Arctic North America. How long ago was this?\r\nWe know from the pictures in the tombs near the pyramids that the\r\nclimate of Egypt was the same 5000 or 6000 years ago as it is now, and\r\nwe have no reason to suppose that, while that of the southern shores of\r\nthe Mediterranean remained unchanged, the northern would vary in any\r\nvery different ratio. Clearing of forests may have done something, but\r\nnever could have accounted for such a change as this. If we take 50,000\r\nor 60,000 years instead of 5000 or 6000, it will not suffice for such a\r\nrevolution, though geologists will be wroth if we assume only 100,000;\r\nas a convenient number this will answer our present purposes.\r\n\r\nHaving at least this space of time at their disposal, the tendency of\r\nmodern antiquaries has been to sweep everything into this great gulf.\r\nWhy, they ask, may not Stonehenge and Avebury be 10,000, 20,000, or\r\n50,000 years old? Man then existed, and why may he not have erected\r\nsuch monuments as these? Of course he might, but there is no proof\r\nthat he did, and as no single tangible reason has yet been adduced\r\nfor supposing them so old, the mere presumption that they might be so\r\ncannot count for much.\r\n\r\nTo my mind the force of argument seems to tend the other way. If a race\r\nof men lived on the face of the globe for 100,000 years so utterly\r\nunprogressive as these cave men, incapable of discovering the use of\r\nmetals for themselves during that long period, or even of adopting them\r\nfrom Egypt and the East, where bronze certainly, and most probably\r\niron, were known at least 6000 or 7000 years ago; if this people\r\nused flint and bone during all this period, is it likely that they\r\nwould adopt new-fangled implements and new customs the first time they\r\nwere presented to them? The Esquimaux have been familiar with the\r\nDanish settlers in Greenland for some centuries, and could easily have\r\nprocured improved implements and many of the advantages of civilization\r\nhad they been so inclined. They have not been changed a hair's-breadth\r\nby the influence of the stranger. The red man of North America has been\r\nin contact with the white man for centuries now. Has he changed, or\r\ncan he change? In Alaska, and to the northward of Vancouver's Island,\r\nthere is a race of savages, called Hydahs, with all the artistic tastes\r\nand faculties of the men of the Dordogne caves, and with about the\r\nsame degree of civilization.[22] All these are dying out, and may soon\r\ndisappear, but they present at this day exactly the same phenomenon as\r\nwe see in the south of France, say 10,000 years ago. They have been\r\nexterminated in all the civilized parts of Europe by the progressive\r\nAryan races who have usurped their places; and it seems only too\r\ncertain that, like them, their American kindred must perish before the\r\ngrowing influence of the white man, but they cannot change. In so far\r\nas we can judge from such facts as are before us, if any family of this\r\nold people still lurked among our hills or on any rocky island, their\r\nhabits, or customs, and their implements, would be as like those of\r\nthe cave men as those of the Esquimaux or Alaska savages are at the\r\npresent day. It appears most unphilosophical to apply to those people\r\nthe principles of progress that are found among the higher races of\r\nmankind, and to represent them as eagerly seizing on any improvement\r\noffered them, and abandoning their old faith and their old habits at\r\nthe bidding of any wandering navigator that visited their shores.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to enter on such an enquiry, but so far as can at\r\npresent be seen, it seems that mankind has progressed not so much by\r\nadvance within the limits of certain races as by the superposition of\r\nmore highly organized races over those of an inferior class. Thus we\r\nhave those stone men of the caves who possessed the world for 100,000\r\nor a million of years, and made no more progress in that period than\r\nthe animals they were associated with. Even the progress from a chipped\r\nto a polished stone implement seems to have been taught them by a\r\nforeign bronze-using people. We have then such races as the Egyptian,\r\nthe Chinese, or the Mexican, who can progress to a certain point, but\r\nstop and cannot go beyond; and, lastly, we have the Aryans, the last\r\nto appear in the field, but the most energetic, and the only truly\r\nprogressive race. Our great error in reasoning with regard to the older\r\nraces seems to be that we insist on applying to them the reasoning and\r\nprinciples which guide us, but which are wholly inapplicable to the\r\nless progressive races of mankind.\r\n\r\nAll this will be plainer in the sequel; but in the meanwhile it may\r\nsafely be asserted that, up to this time, no royal road has been\r\ndiscovered that leads to an explanation of our megalithic antiquities.\r\nNo one has yet been able so to classify the contents of cognate\r\nmonuments as to construct a chronometric scale which is applicable for\r\nthe elucidation of their dates; and no _à priori_ reasoning has been\r\nhit upon that is of the smallest use in explaining either their age or\r\ntheir peculiarities. The one path that seems open to us is a careful\r\nexamination of each individual monument, accompanied by a judicial\r\nsifting of all or any traditions that may attach to it, and aided by a\r\ncomparison with similar monuments in other countries. By this means we\r\nhave a chance of arriving at a fair proximate degree of certainty; for,\r\nthough no one monument will tell its own tale directly, a multitude of\r\nwhispers from a great number may swell into a voice that is clear and\r\ndistinct and be audible to every one; while no system yet invented,\r\nand no _à priori_ reasoning, can lead to anything but deepening the\r\nignorance that now prevails on the subject. This is especially true\r\nwith regard to the great megalithic circles in this country. With the\r\nrarest possible exceptions, no flint and no bronze or iron implements\r\nhave been found within their precincts. They cannot be older than the\r\ninvention of flint implements, and iron has been in continuous use\r\nsince the art of smelting its ores was first discovered. If, therefore,\r\nthey have no written or traditional history which can be relied upon,\r\ntheir age must for ever remain a mystery. The conviction, however,\r\nunder which this book is written is that such a history does exist;\r\nthat, when all the traditions attached to the monuments are sifted\r\nand weighed, they amount to such a mass of circumstantial evidence as\r\nsuffices to prove the case and to establish the main facts of their\r\nhistory and use, wholly independently of any system or of any external\r\ntestimony.\r\n\r\nDirect literary evidence, in the sense in which the term is usually\r\nunderstood, cannot be said to exist. As before mentioned, no classical\r\nauthor alludes, either directly or indirectly, to these megalithic\r\nstructures; yet they could not have been ignorant of them if they\r\nexisted. When Cæsar and his army witnessed the fight between his\r\ngalleys and the fleet of the Veneti in the Morbihan, he must have\r\nstood--if he occupied the best place--on Mont St. Michel, if it then\r\nexisted, and among the stone avenues of Carnac. Is it likely that such\r\nan artist would have omitted the chance of heightening his picture by\r\nan allusion to the \"standing stones\" of Dariorigum? The Romans occupied\r\nOld Sarum probably during the whole time they remained in this island,\r\nand the Via Badonica passed so immediately under Silbury Hill that they\r\ncould not have been ignorant of either Stonehenge or Avebury. Nor in\r\nFrance could they possibly have missed seeing the numerous dolmens with\r\nwhich the country is covered. Notwithstanding all this, the silence is\r\nabsolute. The circular temple of the Hyperboreans is the only thing any\r\none has ever pretended to quote against this; and that, for reasons\r\ngiven above being inadmissible, any argument based on it falls to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nNeither Cæsar nor Tacitus, though describing the religious observances\r\nof our forefathers, make any mention of temples; nor, indeed, does\r\nany other classical author. Tacitus[23] tells us that the Germans\r\nworshipped only in groves; and though this is hardly to the point, his\r\nrelations with Agricola were so intimate that had the Gauls and Britons\r\nhad temples of stone, he could hardly have avoided alluding to them.\r\nThe inference from Cæsar and all the other authors is the same, but\r\nthere is no direct evidence either way.\r\n\r\nThere is no passage in any classical authors which connects the Druids,\r\neither directly or indirectly, with any stone temples or stones of any\r\nsort. Dracontia are wholly the creation of Dr. Stukeley's very fertile\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nSo far, therefore, as negative evidence goes, it is complete in showing\r\nthat our megalithic circles did not exist in the time of the Romans,\r\nand that they were not temples. Unfortunately, however, no amount of\r\nnegative evidence is sufficient to prove an affirmative, though it may\r\nsuffice to establish a strong presumption in favour of a particular\r\nview, and, at all events, clears the way for the production of any\r\ndirect evidence which we may have. The direct written evidence that has\r\nbeen adduced is, however, of the most shadowy character. It amounts\r\nto little more than this:--that every allusion to these monuments in\r\nmediæval authors, every local tradition, every scrap of intelligence\r\nwe have regarding them, points to a post-Roman origin. No writer, of\r\nany age or country, suggested their being prehistoric or even pre-Roman\r\nbefore the age of Stukeley,--say 1700.\r\n\r\nThere is, so far as I know, only one paragraph in any classical\r\nauthor which mentions a French or British temple; but it belonged to\r\nso exceptional a community that it would hardly be safe to base an\r\nargument upon it. A \"hieron,\" Strabo tells us, existed at the mouth\r\nof the Loire, inhabited by a colony of women who lived apart from\r\ntheir husbands, but the roof or thatch of the roof of whose temple\r\nwas renewed annually:[24] a fact that shows, in the first place, that\r\nit had a roof, and in the second, that it was not a very dignified or\r\npermanent structure.\r\n\r\nIt would add very much to the clearness of our conception on this\r\nsubject if the early Christian writers had left us some descriptions\r\nof the temples of the Britons when the missionaries first came among\r\nthem. Though not quite so silent on the subject as the classical\r\nauthors, their direct evidence is far from being so complete as\r\nmight be wished. One of the passages most distinctly bearing on this\r\nquestion is found in a letter which Pope Gregory the Great addressed\r\nto the Abbot Millitus, then on a mission to England. In this letter he\r\ninstructs him by no means to destroy the temples of the idols belonging\r\nto the English, but only the idols which are found in them; and adds,\r\n\"Let holy water be made, and sprinkled over them. Let altars be\r\nconstructed, and relics placed on them; insomuch as if these temples\r\nare well constructed, it is necessary that they should be converted\r\nfrom the worship of dæmons to the service of the true God. So that the\r\npeople, seeing their temples are not destroyed, may put away errors\r\nfrom their hearts, and, acknowledging the true God and adoring Him, may\r\nthe more willingly assemble in the places where they were accustomed\r\nto meet.\"[25] A little further on he adds, in order that no apparent\r\nchange may be made, \"that on great festivals the people may erect huts\r\nof boughs around those churches which have been converted (commutatæ)\r\nfrom temples.\"\r\n\r\nThe fair inference from this paragraph seems to be that there was so\r\nlittle difference between the temples of the Pagans and the churches\r\nof the Christians that a little holy water and a few relics--as much\r\nesteemed in the West as in the East in those days--were all that was\r\nrequired to convert the one into the other.\r\n\r\nWe gather the same impression from another transaction which took\r\nplace at Canterbury about the same time. After taking possession of\r\nthe Cathedral, built of old by the Romans,[26] St. Augustine obtained\r\nfrom the recently converted King Ethelbert the cession of the temple in\r\nwhich he had been accustomed to worship his idols, and without more ado\r\ndedicated it to St. Pancras, and appropriated it as a burying place for\r\nhimself and his successors from the circumstance of its being outside\r\nthe walls.[27] We further learn from Gervaise[28] that it was so used\r\ntill Cuthbert, the second archbishop, got permission to allow burials\r\nwithin the walls, and then erected the baptistry of St. John for this\r\npurpose, where apparently Becket's crown now stands. Afterwards the\r\nmonastery of SS. Peter and Paul, now St. Augustine's, was erected \"in\r\nfundo Templi\"--whatever that may mean--but at that time St. Augustine\r\nseems to have accepted the Pagan temples as perfectly appropriate to\r\nChristian rites.\r\n\r\nIn like manner when King Redwald, after his conversion to Christianity\r\nwas persuaded by his wife not rashly to forsake the faith of his\r\nforefathers, he set up two altars side by side in his temple (in fano),\r\nand dedicated the one to Christ, the other to the \"victims of the\r\ndæmons.\"[29] The temple, apparently, was equally appropriate to either.\r\n\r\nA still more instructive example is the description of the destruction\r\nof the church at Godmundingham by Coifi--the heathen priest--on his\r\nconversion to Christianity. He first desecrated it by throwing a spear\r\ninto it--whether by the door or window we are not told--and then\r\nordered his people to burn it to the ground with all its enclosures.\r\nThese, therefore, must all have been in wood or some equally\r\ncombustible material.[30]\r\n\r\nAll this is not much nor very distinct, but by these passages, and\r\nevery hint we have on the subject, it would appear that the temples\r\nof the Pagans, between the departure of the Romans and the time of\r\nAlfred, were at least very similar to those of the Christians. Both\r\nwere derived from the same model, which was the temple or basilica of\r\nthe Romans, and both were apparently very rude, and generally, we may\r\ninfer, constructed of wood. The word circular does not occur in any\r\ndescription of any Pagan temple yet brought to light, nor the word\r\nstone; nothing, in fact, that would in the remotest degree lead us to\r\nsuppose that Bede, or any one else, was speaking or thinking of the\r\nmegalithic monuments with which we are now concerned.\r\n\r\nAlthough the classical authorities are silent regarding these rude\r\nstone monuments, and contemporary records help us very little in\r\ntrying to understand the form of the temples in which our forefathers\r\nworshipped, till they were converted to Christianity, still the Decrees\r\nof the Councils render it quite certain that Rude Stone Monuments were\r\nobjects of veneration--certainly in France, and, by implication, in\r\nEngland--down to the times of Charlemagne and Alfred, at least.\r\n\r\nOne often-quoted decree of a Council, held at Nantes, exhorts \"Bishops\r\nand their servants to dig up, and remove, and hide in places where they\r\ncannot be found, those stones which in remote and woody places are\r\nstill worshipped, and where vows are still made.\"[31] Unfortunately\r\nthe date of this Council is not certain; but Richard places it in\r\n658, which is probably at least nearly correct.[32] This, however,\r\nis of comparatively little consequence, as in 452 a Council at Arles\r\ndecreed that \"if, in any diocese, any infidel either lighted torches\r\nor worshipped Trees, Fountains, or Stones, or neglected to destroy\r\nthem, he should be found guilty of sacrilege;\"[33] and about a century\r\nlater (567), a Council at Tours exhorts the clergy to excommunicate\r\nthose who, at certain Stones or Trees or Fountains, perpetrate things\r\ncontrary to the ordinances of the Church.[34]\r\n\r\nStill another century further on (681), a Council held at Toledo\r\nadmonishes those who worship Idols or venerate Stones, those who light\r\ntorches or worship Fountains or Trees, that they are sacrificing\r\nto the devil, and subject themselves to various penalties, &c.[35]\r\nAnother Council held in the same city, in the year 692, enumerates\r\nalmost in the same words the various heresies which were condemned by\r\nthe preceding Council.[36] A Council at Rouen, about the same time,\r\ndenounces all who offer vows to Trees or Fountains or Stones as they\r\nwould at altars, or offer candles or gifts, as if any divinity resided\r\nthere capable of conferring good or evil.[37]\r\n\r\nLastly, a decree of Charlemagne, dated Aix-la-Chapelle in 789, utterly\r\ncondemns and execrates before God Trees, Stones, and Fountains, which\r\nfoolish people worship.[38]\r\n\r\nEven as late as in the time of Canute the Great, there is a statute\r\nforbidding the barbarous adoration of the Sun and Moon, Fire,\r\nFountains, Stones, and all kinds of Trees and Wood.[39]\r\n\r\nThe above which are taken from Keysler[40] are not all he quotes,\r\nnor certainly all that could be added, if it were worth while, from\r\nother sources; but they are sufficient to show that, from Toledo to\r\nAix-la-Chapelle--and from the departure of the Romans till the tenth,\r\nor probably the eleventh century--the Christian priesthood waged a\r\ncontinuous but apparently ineffectual warfare against the worship of\r\nStones, Trees, and Fountains. The priests do not condescend to tell\r\nus what the forms of the Stones were which these benighted people\r\nworshipped, whether simple menhirs or dolmens, or \"grottes des fées,\"\r\nnor why they worshipped them; whether they considered them emblems\r\nof some unnamed and unknown God, or memorials of deceased ancestors,\r\nin whose honour they lighted candles, and whom they propitiated with\r\nofferings. Nor do they tell us what the form of that worship was;\r\nthey did not care, and perhaps did not know. Nor do we; for, except\r\nan extreme veneration for their dead, and a consequent ancestral\r\nworship,[41] mixed with a strange adoration of Stones, Trees, and\r\nFountains, we do not know now what the religion was of these rude\r\npeople. The testimony of these edicts is, therefore, not quite so\r\ndistinct as we might wish, and does not enable us to assert that the\r\nRude Stone Monuments, whose age and uses we are trying to ascertain,\r\nwere those alluded to in the preceding paragraphs. But what it\r\ndoes seem to prove is, that down to the 11th century the Christian\r\nPriesthood waged a continuous warfare against the veneration of some\r\nclass of Rude Stone Monuments, to which the pagan population clung with\r\nremarkable tenacity, and many, if not most of which may consequently\r\nhave been erected during that period. This is, at all events,\r\ninfinitely more clear and positive than anything that has been brought\r\nforward in favour of their prehistoric antiquity. If, like the other\r\nbranches of the written argument, this is not sufficient to prove, by\r\nitself, that the monuments were generally or even frequently erected\r\nafter the Christian era, it certainly entitles that assertion to a fair\r\n_locus standi_ in the argument we are attempting to develop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf, however, the pen has been reticent and hesitating in its testimony,\r\nthe spade has been not only prolific but distinct. It is probably\r\nnot an exaggeration to say that three-fourths of the megalithic\r\nmonuments--including the dolmens, of course--have yielded sepulchral\r\ndeposits to the explorer, and, including the tumuli, probably\r\nnine-tenths have been proved to be burial places. Still, at the present\r\nstage of the enquiry, it would be at least premature to assume that\r\nthe remaining tenth of the whole, or the remaining fourth of the stone\r\nsection, must necessarily be sepulchral. Some may have been cenotaphic,\r\nor simply monuments, such as we erect to our great men--not necessarily\r\nwhere the bodies are laid. Some stones and some tumuli may have been\r\nerected to commemorate events, and some mounds certainly were erected\r\nas \"Motes\" or \"Things\"--places of judgment or assembly. In like manner\r\nsome circles may have been originally, or may afterwards have been\r\nused as places of assembly, or may have been what may more properly be\r\ncalled temples of the dead, than tombs. These, however, certainly are\r\nthe exceptions. The ruling idea throughout is still of a sepulchre,\r\nwith what exceptions, and at what age erected, is the thesis which we\r\nnow propose to investigate.\r\n\r\nAt present these are mere assertions, and it is not pretended that\r\nthey are more, and they are only brought forward in this place in order\r\nto enunciate the propositions it is hoped we may be able to prove as we\r\nadvance in this enquiry. These are,--\r\n\r\nFirst, that the Rude Stone Monuments with which we are concerned are\r\ngenerally sepulchral, or connected directly, or indirectly, with the\r\nrites of the dead.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that they are not temples in any usual or appropriate\r\nsense of the term, and, Lastly,--that they were generally erected by\r\npartially civilized races after they had come in contact with the\r\nRomans, and most of them may be considered as belonging to the first\r\nten centuries of the Christian Era.\r\n\r\nIn stating these three propositions so broadly, it must be borne in\r\nmind, that the evidence on which their proof or disproof rests is\r\neminently cumulative in its character; not perhaps with regard to the\r\nuse to which the monuments were applied, that probably will be admitted\r\nas settled, as so large a proportion of the tumuli can be shown to have\r\na fair title to a sepulchral character, and most of the stone monuments\r\ncan equally lay claim to being erected for the same purpose to which\r\none-half of them have been certainly proved to have been dedicated.\r\nThis is the more clear, as, on the other hand, in spite of every\r\nsurmise or conjecture, no one monument of the class we are treating of\r\ncan be proved to have been erected as a temple, or as intended for any\r\ncivic or civil purpose.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their age, the case is not quite so easily settled.\r\nExcept such monuments as those of Gorm and Thyra, and one or two\r\nothers, to be mentioned hereafter, few can produce such proof of their\r\nage as would stand investigation in a court of law. But when all the\r\ntraditions, all the analogies, and all the probabilities of the case\r\nare examined, they seem to make up such an accumulation of evidence\r\nas is irresistible; and the whole appears to present an unbroken and\r\nintelligible sequence which explains everything. The proof of all this,\r\nhowever, does not rest on the evidence of two or three, or even of a\r\ndozen, of instances, but is based upon the multiplication of a great\r\nnumber of coincidences derived from a large number of instances, which\r\ntaken together in the cumulative form, make up a stronger body of\r\nproof than could be obtained from the direct testimony of one or two\r\ncases. To appreciate this, however, the whole must be taken together.\r\nTo try to invalidate it by selecting one or two prominent cases, where\r\nthe proof is manifestly insufficient when taken by itself, is to\r\nmisunderstand and misrepresent the whole force of the argument.\r\n\r\nOne point, I fancy, there will be very little difficulty in proving,\r\nwhich is, that the whole form one continuous group, extending in an\r\nunbroken series, from the earliest to the latest. There is no hiatus\r\nor break anywhere; and if some can be proved to belong to the 10th\r\ncentury, it is only a question how far you can, by extenuating the\r\nthread, extend it backwards. It can hardly be much beyond the Christian\r\nera. It seems that such a date satisfies all the known conditions of\r\nthe problem, in so far as the Stone Monuments at least are concerned.\r\nThere is, so far as I know at present, absolutely no evidence on the\r\nother side, except what is derived from the Danish system of the three\r\nages: if that is established as a rule of law, _cadit questio_, there\r\nis no more to be said on the subject. But this is exactly what does not\r\nappear to have yet been established on any sufficient or satisfactory\r\nbasis. There need be no difficulty in granting that men used stone and\r\nbone for implements, before they were acquainted with the use of the\r\nmetals. It may also be admitted, that they used bronze before they\r\nlearned the art of extracting iron from its ores. But what is denied\r\nis, that they abandoned the use of these primitive implements on the\r\nintroduction of the metals; and it is contended that they employed\r\nstone and bone simultaneously with bronze and iron, down to a very late\r\nperiod. The real fact of the case seems to be, that the people on the\r\nshores of the Baltic and the North Sea, were as remote from the centres\r\nof civilization on the Mediterranean and to the eastward of it in the\r\nearlier centuries of our era, and were as little influenced by them,\r\nas the inhabitants of the islands in the Pacific and Arctic America\r\nwere by Europe in the last century. In the remote corners of the world,\r\na stone and bone age exists at the present day, only modified by the\r\nuse of such metal implements as they can obtain by barter or exchange:\r\nand this appears to have been the state of northern Europe, till, with\r\ntheir conversion to Christianity, the new civilization was domesticated\r\namong its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: Those three treatises were afterwards republished in\r\n    one volume, small folio, with all the plates, &c., in London, 1725.\r\n    It is from this volume that the above is abstracted.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Cæsar, 'De Bell.

In the present state of our knowledge such an\r\narrangement is hardly possible, still the following 5 groups, with\r\ntheir sub-divisions, are sufficiently distinct to enable them to be\r\ntreated separately, and are so arranged as roughly to represent what we\r\nknow of their sequence, with immense overlappings, however, on every\r\njoint.\r\n\r\n  I.--TUMULI     _a._ Or barrows of earth only.\r\n                 _b._ With small stone chambers or cists.\r\n                 _c._ With megalithic chambers or dolmens.\r\n                 _d._ With external access to chambers.\r\n\r\n  II.--DOLMENS   _a._ Free standing dolmens without tumuli.\r\n                 _b._ Dolmens upon the outside of tumuli.\r\n\r\n  III.--CIRCLES  _a._ Circles surrounding tumuli.\r\n                 _b._ Circles surrounding dolmens.\r\n                 _c._ Circles without tumuli or dolmens.\r\n\r\n  IV.--AVENUES   _a._ Avenues attached to circles.\r\n                 _b._ Avenues with or without circles or dolmens.\r\n\r\n  V.--MENHIRS    _a._ Single or in groups.\r\n                 _b._ With oghams, sculptures, or runes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMULI.\r\n\r\nThe first three of the sub-divisions of the first class are so\r\nmixed together that it is almost impossible in the present state of\r\nour knowledge to separate them with precision either as to date or\r\nlocality, while, as they hardly belong to the main subject of this\r\nbook, it will not be worth while to attempt it here.\r\n\r\nWithout being too speculative, perhaps, it may be assumed that the\r\nearliest mode in which mankind disposed of the bodies of their deceased\r\nrelatives or neighbours was by simple inhumation. They dug a hole in\r\nthe earth, and, having laid the body therein, simply replaced the\r\nearth upon it, and to mark the spot, if the person so buried was of\r\nsufficient importance to merit such care, they raised a mound over the\r\ngrave. It is difficult, however, to believe that mankind were long\r\ncontent with so simple a mode of sepulture. To heap earth or stones on\r\nthe body of the beloved departed so as to crush and deface it, must\r\nhave seemed rude and harsh, and some sort of coffin was probably early\r\ndevised for the protection of the corpse,--in well-wooded countries,\r\nthis would be of wood, which, if the mound is old, has perished long\r\nago--in stony countries, as probably of stone, forming the rude cists\r\nso commonly found in early graves. That these should expand into\r\nchambers seems also natural as civilization advanced, and as man's\r\nideas of a future state and the wants and necessities of such a future\r\nbecame more developed.\r\n\r\nThe last stage would seem to be when access was retained to the\r\nsepulchral chamber, in order that the descendants of the deceased might\r\nbring offerings, or supply the wants of their relative during the\r\nintermediate state which some nations assumed must elapse before the\r\ntranslation of the body to another world.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that some such stages as these were passed through by\r\nall the burying races of mankind, though at very various intervals\r\nand with very different details, while fortunately for our present\r\nsubject it seems that the earliest races were those most addicted to\r\nthis mode of honouring their dead. All mankind, it is true, bury their\r\ndead either in the flesh or their ashes after cremation. It is one of\r\nthose peculiarities which, like speech, distinguish mankind from the\r\nlower animals, and which are so strangely overlooked by the advocates\r\nof the fashionable theory of our ape descent. All mankind, however,\r\ndo not reverence their dead to the same extent. The peculiarity is\r\nmost characteristic of the earlier underlying races, whom we have\r\ngenerally been in the habit of designating as the Turanian races of\r\nmankind. But if that term is objected to, the tomb-building races may\r\nbe specified--beginning from the East--as the Chinese; the Monguls in\r\nTartary, or Mogols, as they were called, in India; the Tartars in\r\ntheir own country, or in Persia; the ancient Pelasgi in Greece; the\r\nEtrurians in Italy; and the races, whoever they were, who preceded the\r\nCelts in Europe. But the tomb-building people, _par excellence_, in the\r\nold world were the Egyptians. Not only were the funereal rites the most\r\nimportant element in the religious life of the people, but they began\r\nat an age earlier than the history or tradition of any other nation\r\ncarries us back to. The great Pyramid of Gizeh was erected certainly as\r\nearly as 3000 years before Christ; yet it must be the lineal descendant\r\nof a rude-chambered tumulus or cairn, with external access to the\r\nchambers, and it seems difficult to calculate how many thousands of\r\nyears it must have required before such rude sepulchres as those our\r\nancestors erected--many probably after the Christian era--could have\r\nbeen elaborated into the most perfect and most gigantic specimens of\r\nmasonry which the world has yet seen. The phenomenon of anything so\r\nperfect as the Pyramids starting up at once, absolutely without any\r\nprevious examples being known, is so unique[42] in the world's history,\r\nthat it is impossible to form any conjecture how long before this\r\nperiod the Egyptians tried to protect their bodies from decay during\r\nthe probationary 3000 years.[43]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Section of Tomb of Alyattes. From Spiegelthal. No\r\nscale.]\r\n\r\nOutside Egypt the oldest tumulus we know of, with an absolutely\r\nauthentic date, is that which Alyattes, the father of Crœsus,\r\nking of Lydia, erected for his own resting-place before the year 561\r\nB.C. It was described by Herodotus,[44] and has of late years\r\nbeen thoroughly explored by Dr. Olfers.[45] Its dimensions are very\r\nconsiderable, and very nearly those given by the father of history. It\r\nis 1180 feet in diameter, or about twice as much as Silbury Hill, and\r\n200 feet in height, as against 130 of that boasted monument. The upper\r\npart, like many of our own mounds, is composed of alternate layers of\r\nclay, loam, and a kind of rubble concrete. These support a mass of\r\nbrickwork, surmounted by a platform of masonry; on this still lies one\r\nof Steles, described by Herodotus, and another of the smaller ones was\r\nfound close by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. Elevation of Tumulus at Tantalais. From Texier's\r\n'Asie Mineure.' 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3. Plan and Section of Chamber in Tumulus at Tantalais.]\r\n\r\nThere is another group of tombs, called those of Tantalais, found near\r\nSmyrna, which are considerably older than those of Sardis, though their\r\ndate cannot be fixed with such certainty as that last described. Still\r\nthere seems no good reason for doubting that the one here represented\r\nmay be as old as the eleventh or twelfth century B.C., nor\r\ndoes it seem reasonable to doubt but these tumuli which still stand on\r\nthe plain of Troy do cover the remains of the heroes who perished in\r\nthat remarkable siege.[46]\r\n\r\nA still more interesting group, however, is that at Mycenæ, known\r\nas the tombs or treasuries of the Atridæ, and described as such by\r\nPausanias.[47] The principal, or at least the best preserved of these,\r\nis a circular chamber, 48 feet 6 inches in diameter, covered by a\r\nhorizontal vault, and having a sepulchral chamber on one side. Dodwell\r\ndiscovered three others of the five mentioned by Pausanias,[48] and\r\nhe also explored the sepulchre of Minyas at Orchomenos, which had a\r\ndiameter of 65 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4. Section and Plan of Tomb of Atreus at Mycenæ. Scale\r\nof plan 100 ft. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5. View of Cocumella, Vulci.]\r\n\r\nAnother group of tombs, contemporary or nearly so with these, are\r\nfound in the older cemeteries of the Etrurians at Cœre, Vulci, and\r\nelsewhere. One of the largest of these is one called Cocumella, at\r\nVulci, which is 240 feet in diameter, and must originally have been\r\n115 to 120 feet in height. Near the centre rise two steles, but so\r\nunsymmetrically that it is impossible to understand why they were\r\nso placed and how they could have been grouped into anything like a\r\ncomplete design. The sepulchre, too, is placed on one side.\r\n\r\nA still richer and more remarkable tomb is that known as the Regulini\r\nGaleassi Tomb at Cœre, the chamber of which is represented in the\r\nannexed woodcut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6. View of principal Chamber in Regulini Galeassi Tomb.]\r\n\r\nIt is filled, as may be seen, with vessels and furniture, principally\r\nof bronze and of the most elaborate workmanship. The patterns on these\r\nvessels are so archaic, and resemble so much some of the older ones\r\nfound at Nineveh, whose dates are at least approximately known, that we\r\nmay safely refer the tomb to an age not later than the tenth century\r\nB.C.[49]\r\n\r\nWe have thus around the eastern shores of the Mediterranean a group of\r\ncircular sepulchral tumuli of well defined age. Some, certainly, are as\r\nold as the thirteenth century B.C., others extend downwards\r\nto, say 500 B.C. All have a podium of stone. Some are wholly\r\nof that material, but in most of them the cone is composed of earth,\r\nand all have sepulchral chambers built with stones in horizontal\r\nlayers, not so megalithic as those found in our tumuli, but of a more\r\npolished and artistic form of construction.\r\n\r\nThe age, too, in which these monuments were erected was essentially\r\nthe age of bronze; not only are the ornaments and furniture found in\r\nthe Etruscan tombs generally of that metal, but the tombs at Mycenæ\r\nand Orchomenos were wholly lined with it. The holes into which the\r\nbronze nails were inserted still exist everywhere, and some of the\r\nnails themselves are in the British Museum. It was also the age in\r\nwhich Solomon furnished his temple with all those implements and\r\nornaments in brass--properly bronze--described in the Bible,[50] and\r\nthe brazen house of Priam and fifty such expressions show how common\r\nthe metal was in that day. All this, however, does not prove that iron\r\nalso was not known then. In the Egyptian paintings iron is generally\r\nrepresented as a blue metal, bronze as red, and throughout they are\r\ncarefully distinguished by these colours. Now, in the tombs around the\r\npyramids, and of an age contemporary with them, there are numerous\r\nrepresentations of blue swords as there are of red spear-heads, and\r\nthere seems no reason for doubting that iron was known to the Greeks\r\nbefore the war of Troy, to the Israelites before they left Egypt (1320\r\nB.C.), or to the Etruscans when they first settled in Italy.\r\nHesiod's assertion that brass was known before iron may or may not be\r\ntrue.[51] In so far as his evidence is concerned we learn from it that\r\niron was certainly in use long before his time (800 B.C.); so\r\nlong indeed that he does not pretend to know when or by whom it was\r\ninvented, and the modes of manufacturing steel--ἀδάμασ--seem also\r\nto have been perfectly known in his day.\r\n\r\nIn India, too, as we shall see when we come to speak of that country,\r\nthe extraction of iron from its ores was known from the earliest ages,\r\nand in the third or fourth century of our era reached a degree of\r\nperfection which has hardly since been surpassed. The celebrated iron\r\npillar at the Kutub, near Delhi, which is of that age, may probably\r\nstill boast of being the largest mass of forged iron that the world yet\r\npossesses, and attests a wonderful amount of skill on the part of those\r\nwho made it.\r\n\r\nWhen from these comparatively civilized modes of sepulture we turn to\r\nthe forms employed in our own country, as described by Thurnam[52]\r\nor Bateman,[53] we are startled to find how like they are, but, at\r\nthe same time, how infinitely more rude. They are either long barrows\r\ncovering the remains of a race of dolicocephalic savages laid in\r\nrudely-framed cists, with implements of flint and bone and the coarsest\r\npossible pottery, but without one vestige of metal of any sort, or\r\ncircular tumuli of a brachycephalic race shown to have been slightly\r\nmore advanced by their remains being occasionally incinerated, and\r\nornaments of bronze and spear-heads of that metal being also sometimes\r\nfound buried in their tombs.\r\n\r\nAccording to the usual mode of reasoning on these subjects, the\r\nlong-headed people are older than the broad-pated race, the one\r\nsuperseding the other, and both must have been anterior to the people\r\non the shores of the Mediterranean, for these were familiar with the\r\nuse of both metals, and fabricated pottery which we cannot now equal\r\nfor perfection of texture and beauty of design.\r\n\r\nThe first defect that strikes one in this argument is that if it proves\r\nanything it proves too much. We certainly have sepulchral barrows in\r\nthis country of the Roman period, the Bartlow hills, for instance--of\r\nwhich more hereafter--and Saxon grave mounds everywhere; but according\r\nto this theory not one sepulchre of any sort between the year 1200\r\nB.C. and the Christian era. All our sepulchres are ruder, and\r\nbetoken a less advanced stage of civilization than the earliest of\r\nthose in Greece or Etruria, and therefore, according to the usually\r\naccepted dogma, must be earlier.\r\n\r\nIt may be argued, however, that several are older than the Argive\r\nexamples. That the Jersey tomb (woodcut No. 11), notwithstanding the\r\ncoin of Claudius, is older, because more rude, than the Treasury at\r\nMycenæ (woodcut No. 4); but that the Bartlow hills and the Derbyshire\r\ndolmens and tumuli above alluded to (page 11 et seq.), containing\r\ncoins of Valentinian and the Roman Emperors, are more modern. Such an\r\nhypothesis as this involves the supposition that there is a great gap\r\nin the series, and that after discontinuing the practice for a 1000\r\nor 1500 years, our forefathers returned to their old habits, but with\r\nruder forms than they had used before, and after continuing them for\r\nfive or six centuries, finally abandoned them. This is possible, of\r\ncourse, but there is absolutely no proof of it that I know. On the\r\ncontrary, so far as our knowledge of them at present extends, the\r\nwhole of the megalithic rude stone monuments group together as one\r\nstyle as essentially as the Classical or Gothic or any other style\r\nof architecture. No solution of continuity can be detected anywhere.\r\nAll are--it may be--prehistoric; or all, as I believe to be the case,\r\nbelong to historic times. The choice seems to be between these two\r\ncategories; any hypothesis based on the separation into a historic and\r\na prehistoric group, distinct in characteristics as in age, appears to\r\nbe utterly untenable.\r\n\r\nThe argument derived from the absence of iron in all our sepulchres\r\nalso proves more than is desirable. The Danish antiquaries all admit\r\nthat iron was not known in that country before the Christian era. Our\r\nantiquaries, from the testimony of Cæsar as to its use in war by the\r\nBritons, are forced to admit an earlier date, but it is hardly, if\r\never, found in graves. It is, on the other hand, perhaps correct to\r\nassume that its use was known in Egypt 3000 years before Christ; even\r\nif this is disputed, it certainly was known in the 18th dynasty, 15\r\ncenturies B.C., and generally in the Mediterranean shortly\r\nafterwards. If, then, the knowledge of the most useful of metals took\r\n3000 or even 1500 years to travel across the continent of Europe, it\r\nseems impossible to base any argument on the influence these people\r\nexercised on one another, or on the knowledge they may have had of each\r\nothers' ways.\r\n\r\nOr to take the argument in a form nearer home. When Cæsar warred\r\nagainst the Veneti in the Morbihan, he found them in possession of\r\nvessels larger and stronger than the Roman galleys, capable of being\r\nmanœuvred by their sails alone, without the use of oars. Not only\r\nwere these vessels fastened by iron nails, but they were moored by\r\nchain cables of iron. To manufacture such chains, the Veneti must\r\nhave had access to large mines of the ore, and had long familiarity\r\nwith its manufacture, and they used it not only for purposes on shore\r\nlike the Britons, but in vessels capable of trading between Brest and\r\nPenzance--no gentle sea--and quite equal to voyages to the Baltic or\r\nother northern ports, which they no doubt made; it is asserted that, in\r\n50 B.C., the Scandinavians were ignorant of the use of iron,\r\nthough their country possessed the richest mines and the best ores of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter appears to be that, a century or so before\r\nChrist, England and Denmark were as little known to Greece and Italy,\r\nand as little influenced by their arts or civilization, as Borneo or\r\nNew Zealand were by those of modern Europe at the beginning of the last\r\ncentury. Even now, with all our colonization and civilizing power, we\r\nhave had marvellously little real influence on the native races, and\r\nwere our power removed, all traces would rapidly disappear, and the\r\npeople revert at once to what they were, and act as they were wont to\r\ndo, before they knew us.\r\n\r\nIn like manner the North American Indians have been very little\r\ninfluenced by the residence of some millions of proselytizing Europeans\r\namong them for 200 years, and while this is so, it seems most\r\ngroundless to argue because a few Phœnician traders may have visited\r\nthis island to purchase tin, that, therefore, they introduced their\r\nmanners and customs among its inhabitants; or because a traveller like\r\nPytheas may have visited the Cimbrian Chersonese, or even penetrated\r\nnearly to the Arctic Circle, that his visit had, or could have, any\r\ninfluence on the civilization of these countries.[54] Civilization, as\r\nfar as we can see, was only advanced in northern and western Europe\r\nby the extermination of the ruder races. Had this rude but effective\r\nmethod not been resorted to, we should probably have a stone-using\r\npeople among us at the present day.\r\n\r\nWe may not know much of what happened in northern Europe before the\r\ntime of the Romans, but we feel tolerably safe in asserting that\r\nnone of the civilized nations around the Mediterranean basin ever\r\ncolonized and settled sufficiently long in northern Europe to influence\r\nperceptibly the manners or usages of the natives. What progress was\r\nmade was effected by migrations among themselves, the more civilized\r\ntribes taking the place of those less advanced, and bringing their\r\nhigher civilization with them.\r\n\r\nIf these views are at all correct, it seems hopeless by any empirical\r\ntheories founded on what we believe ought to have happened or on\r\nany analogies drawn from what occurred in other countries to arrive\r\nat satisfactory conclusions on the subject. It is at best reasoning\r\nfrom the unknown towards what we fancy may be found out. A much more\r\nsatisfactory process would be to reason from the known backwards so far\r\nas we have a sure footing, and we may feel certain that by degrees as\r\nour knowledge advances we shall get further and further forward in the\r\ntrue track, and may eventually be able to attach at least approximative\r\ndates to all our monuments.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view, what concerns us most, in the first instance\r\nat least, is to know how late, rather than how early, our ancestors\r\nburied in tumuli. We have, for instance, certainly, the Bartlow\r\nHills, just alluded to, which are sepulchres of the Roman period,\r\nprobably of Hadrian's time; and we have in Denmark the tumuli in which\r\nKing Gorm and his English wife, Queen Thyra Danebode, were buried\r\nin A.D. 950. We probably also may be able to fill in a few\r\nothers between these two dates, and add some after even the last.\r\nThus, therefore, we have a firm basis from which to start, and working\r\nbackwards from it may clear up some difficulties that now appear\r\ninsuperable.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOLMENS.\r\n\r\nThe monuments alluded to in the last section were either the rude\r\nbarrows of our savage ancestors, with the ruder cists, or the chambered\r\ntumuli of a people who, when we first became acquainted with them,\r\nhad attained nearly as high a degree of civilization as any Turanian\r\npeople are capable of attaining. The people who erected such buildings\r\nas the Tombs of Mycenæ or Orchomenos must have reached a respectable\r\ndegree of organization. They possessed a perfect knowledge of the use\r\nof metals, and great wealth in bronze at least, and had attained to\r\nconsiderable skill in construction. Yet it is not difficult to trace\r\nback--in imagination, at least--the various steps by which a small rude\r\nchamber in a circular mound, just capable of protecting a single body,\r\nmay by degrees have grown into a richly-ornamented brazen chamber, 50\r\nor 60 feet in diameter and of equal height. Nor is it more difficult\r\nto foresee what this buried chamber would have become, had not the\r\nAryan occupation of Greece--figured under the myth of the return of\r\nthe Heracleidæ--put a stop to the tomb-building propensities of the\r\npeople. Before long it must have burst from its chrysalis state,\r\nand assumed a form of external beauty. It must have emerged from its\r\nearthen envelope, and taken a form which it did take in Africa[55] a\r\nthousand years afterwards,--a richly-ornamented podium, surmounted by a\r\nstepped cone and crowned by a stele. In Greece it went no further, and\r\nits history and its use were alike strange to the people who afterwards\r\noccupied the country.\r\n\r\nIn Italy its history was somewhat different. The more mixed people of\r\nRome eagerly adopted the funereal magnificence of the Etruscans, and\r\ntheir tumuli under the Empire became magnified into such monuments as\r\nthe Tomb of Augustus in the Campus Martius, or the still more gorgeous\r\nmausoleum of Hadrian, at the foot of the Vatican hill.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, it would not be difficult by the same process to trace\r\nthe steps by which the rude tepés of the Tartar steppes bloomed at last\r\ninto the wondrous domes of the Patan and Mogol Emperors of Delhi or\r\nthe other Mahomedan principalities in the East. To do all this would\r\nform a most interesting chapter in the history of architecture, more\r\ninteresting, perhaps, than the one we are about to attempt; but it is\r\nnot the same, though both spring from the same origin. The people or\r\npeoples who eventually elaborated these wonderful mausoleums or domed\r\nstructures affected, at the very earliest periods at which we become\r\nacquainted with them, what may be called Microlithic architecture. In\r\nother words, they used as small stones as they could use, consistently\r\nwith their constructive necessities. These stones were always squared\r\nor hewn, and they always sought to attain their ends by construction,\r\nnot by the exhibition of mere force. On the other hand, the people\r\nwhose works now occupy us always affected the employment of the largest\r\nmasses of stone they could find or move. With the rarest possible\r\nexceptions, they preferred their being untouched by a chisel, and as\r\nrarely were they ever used in any properly constructive sense. In\r\nalmost every instance it was sought to attain the wished-for end by\r\nmass and the expression of power. No two styles of architecture can\r\nwell be more different, either in their forms or motives, than these\r\ntwo. All that they have in common is that they both spring from the\r\nsame origin in the chambered tumulus, and both were devoted throughout\r\nto sepulchral purposes, but in form and essence they diverged at a very\r\nearly period. Long before we become acquainted with either; and, having\r\nonce separated, they only came together again when both were on the\r\npoint of expiring.\r\n\r\nThe Buddhist Dagobas are another offshoot from the same source, which\r\nit would be quite as interesting to follow as the tombs of the kings or\r\nemperors; for our present purposes, perhaps, more so, as they retained\r\nthroughout a religious character, and being consequently freed from the\r\never-varying influence of individual caprice, they bear the impress of\r\ntheir origin distinctly marked upon them to the present day.\r\n\r\nIn India, where Buddhism, as we now know it, first arose, the prevalent\r\ncustom--at least among the civilized races--was cremation. We do\r\nnot know when they buried their dead; but in the earliest times of\r\nBuddhism they adopted at once what was certainly a sepulchral tumulus,\r\nand converted it into a relic shrine: just as in the early ages of\r\nChristianity the stone sarcophagus became the altar in the basilica,\r\nand was made to contain the relics of the saint or saints to whom\r\nthe church was dedicated. The earliest monuments of this class which\r\nwe now know are those erected by the King Asoka, about the year 250\r\nB.C.; but there does not seem much reason for doubting that\r\nwhen the body of Buddha was burnt, and his relics distributed among\r\neight different places,[56] Dagobas or Stupas may not then have\r\nbeen erected for their reception. None of these have, however, been\r\nidentified; and of the 84,000 traditionally said to have been erected\r\nby Asoka, that at Sanchi[57] is the only one we can feel quite sure\r\nbelongs to his age; but, from that date to the present day, in India as\r\nwell as in Ceylon, Burmah, Siam, and elsewhere, examples exist without\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nAll these are microlithic, evidently the work of a civilized and\r\nrefined people, though probably copies of the rude forms of more\r\nprimitive races. Many of them have stone enclosures; but, like that at\r\nSanchi, erected between 250 B.C. and 1 A.D., so evidently derived from\r\ncarpentry that we feel it was copied directly, like all the Buddhist\r\narchitecture of that age, from wooden originals. Whether it was from\r\nthe fashion of erecting stone circles round tumuli, or from what other\r\ncause, it is impossible now to say; but as time went on the form of the\r\nrail became more and more essentially lithic, and throughout the middle\r\nages the Buddhist tope, with its circle or circles of stones, bore much\r\nmore analogy to the megalithic monuments of our own country than did\r\nthe tombs just alluded to; and we are often startled by similarities\r\nwhich, however, seem to have no other cause than their having a common\r\nparent, being, in fact, derived from one primæval original. There\r\nis nothing in all this, at all events, that would lead us to the\r\nconclusion that the polished stone monuments of India were either older\r\nor more modern than the rude stone structures of the West. Each, in\r\nfact, must be judged by its own standard, and by that alone.\r\n\r\nFor the proper understanding of what is to follow the distinctions just\r\npointed out should always be borne in mind, as none are more important.\r\nHalf indeed of the confusion that exists on the subject arises from\r\ntheir having been hitherto neglected. There is no doubt that occasional\r\nsimilarities can be detected between these various styles, but they\r\namount to nothing more than should be expected from family likenesses\r\nconsequent upon their having a common origin and analogous purposes.\r\nBut, except to this extent, these styles seem absolutely distinct\r\nthroughout their whole course, though running parallel to one another\r\nduring the whole period in which they are practised. If this is so,\r\nany hypothesis based on the idea that the microlithic architecture\r\neither preceded or succeeded to the megalithic at once falls to the\r\nground. Nor, if these distinctions are maintained, will it any longer\r\nbe possible to determine any dates in succession in megalithic art from\r\nanalogies drawn from what may have happened at any period or place\r\namong the builders of microlithic structures. The fact which we have\r\ngot to deal with seems to be that the megalithic rude stone art of our\r\nforefathers is a thing by itself--a peculiar form of art arising either\r\nfrom its being adopted by a peculiar race or peculiar group of races\r\namong mankind, or from its having been practised by people at a certain\r\nstage of civilization, or under peculiar circumstances, and this it is\r\nour business to try to find out and define. But to do this, the first\r\nthing that seems requisite is to put aside all previously conceived\r\nnotions on the subject, and to treat it as one entirely new, and as\r\ndepending for its elucidation wholly on what can be gathered from its\r\nown form and its own utterances, however indistinct they may at first\r\nappear to be.\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, we have no difficulty in beginning our history\r\nof megalithic remains with the rude stone cists, generally called\r\nkistvaens, which are found in sepulchral tumuli. Sometimes these\r\nconsist of only four, but generally of six or more stones set edgeways,\r\nand covered by a cap-stone, so as to protect the body from being\r\ncrushed. By degrees this kistvaen became magnified into a chamber, the\r\nside stones increasing from 1 or 2 feet in height to 4 or 5 feet, and\r\nthe cap-stone becoming a really megalithic feature 6 or 10 feet long,\r\nby 4 or 5 feet wide, and also of considerable thickness. Many of these\r\ncontained more than one funeral deposit, and they consequently could\r\nnot have been covered up by the tumuli till the last deposit was placed\r\nin them. This seems to have been felt as an inconvenience, as it led to\r\nthe third step, namely, of a passage communicating with the outer air,\r\nand formed like the chambers of upright stones, and roofed by flat ones\r\nextending across from side to side. The most perfect example of this\r\nclass is perhaps that in the tumulus of Gavr Innis in the Morbihan.\r\nHere is a gallery 42 feet long and from 4 to 5 feet wide, leading to a\r\nchamber 8 feet square, the whole being covered with sculptures of the\r\nmost elaborate character.\r\n\r\nA fourth stage is well illustrated by the chambers of New Grange, in\r\nIreland, where a similar passage leads to a compound or cruciform\r\nchamber rudely roofed by converging stones. Another beautiful example\r\nof the same class is that of Maeshow in the Orkneys, which, owing to\r\nthe peculiarity of the stone with which it is built, comes more nearly\r\nto the character of microlithic art than any other example. It is\r\nprobably among the last if not the very latest of the class erected in\r\nthese isles, and by a curious concatenation of circumstances brings the\r\nmegalithic form of art very nearly up to the stage where we left its\r\nmicrolithic sister at Mycenæ some two thousand years before its time.\r\n\r\nAll this will be made clearer in the sequel, but meanwhile there are\r\none or two points which must be cleared up before we can go further.\r\nMany antiquaries insist that all the dolmens[58] or cromlechs,[59]\r\nwhich we now see standing free, were once covered up and buried in\r\ntumuli.[60] That all the earlier ones were so, is more than probable,\r\nand it may since have been originally intended also to cover up many of\r\nthose which now stand free; but it seems impossible to believe that the\r\nbulk of those we now see were ever hidden by any earthen covering.\r\n\r\nProbably at least one hundred uncovered dolmens in these islands could\r\nbe enumerated, which have not now a trace of any such envelope. Some\r\nare situated on uncultivated heaths, some on headlands, and most of\r\nthem in waste places. Yet it is contended that improving farmers at\r\nsome remote age not only levelled the mounds, but actually carted\r\nthe whole away and spread it so evenly over the surface that it is\r\nimpossible now to detect its previous existence. If this had taken\r\nplace in this century when land has become so valuable and labour\r\nso skilled we might not wonder, but no trace of any such operation\r\noccurs in any living memory. Take for instance Kits Cotty House, it is\r\nexactly now where it was when Stukeley drew it in 1715,[61] and there\r\nwas no tradition then of any mound ever having covered it. Yet it is\r\ncontended that at some earlier age when the site was probably only a\r\nsheep-walk, some one carried away the mound for some unknown purpose,\r\nand spread it out so evenly that we cannot now find a trace of it.\r\nOr take another instance, that at Clatford Bottom,[62] also drawn by\r\nStukeley. It stands as a chalky flat to which cultivation is only now\r\nextending, and which certainly was a sheep-walk in Stukeley's time,\r\nand why, therefore, any one should have taken the trouble or been at\r\nthe expense of denuding it is very difficult to understand, and so\r\nit is with nine-tenths of the rest of them. In the earlier days when\r\na feeling for the seclusion of the tomb was strong, burying them in\r\nthe recesses of a tumulus may have been the universal practice, but\r\nwhen men learned to move such masses as they afterwards did, and to\r\npoise them so delicately in the air, they may well have preferred the\r\nexhibition of their art to concealing it in a heap which had no beauty\r\nof form and exhibited no skill. Can any one for instance conceive that\r\nsuch a dolmen as that at Castle Wellan in Ireland ever formed a chamber\r\nin barrow, or that any Irish farmer would ever have made such a level\r\nsweep of its envelope if it ever had one? So in fact it is with almost\r\nall we know. When a dolmen was intended to be buried in a tumulus the\r\nstones supporting the roof were placed as closely to one another as\r\npossible, so as to form walls and prevent the earth penetrating between\r\nthem and filling the chambers, which was easily accomplished by filling\r\nin the interstices with small stones as was very generally done. These\r\ntripod dolmens, however, like that at Castle Wellan, just quoted, never\r\nhad, or could have had walls. The cap-stone is there poised on three\r\npoints, and is a studied exhibition of a _tour de force_. No traces of\r\nwalls exist, and if earth had been heaped upon it the intervals would\r\nhave been the first part filled, and the roof an absurdity, as no\r\nchamber could have existed. These tripod dolmens are very numerous, and\r\nwell worth distinguishing, as it is probable that they will turn out to\r\nbe more modern than the walled variety of the same class. But with our\r\npresent limited knowledge it is hardly safe to insist on this, however\r\nprobable it seems at first sight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7. Dolmen in Castle Wellan, Ireland. From a drawing by\r\nSir Henry James.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8. Dolmen de Bousquet. From a drawing by E. Cartailhac.]\r\n\r\nThe question, however, fortunately, hardly requires to be argued,\r\ninasmuch as in Ireland, in Denmark,[63] and more especially in France,\r\nwe have numerous examples of dolmens on the top of tumuli, where it is\r\nimpossible they should ever have been covered with earth. One example\r\nfor the present will explain what is meant. In the Dolmen de Bousquet\r\nin the Aveyron[64] the chamber is placed on the top of a tumulus,\r\nwhich from the three circles of stone that surround it, and other\r\nindications, never could have been higher or larger than it now is.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, none of these dolmen-crowned tumuli have been dug\r\ninto, which is to be regretted, as it would be curious to know whether\r\nthe external dolmen is the real or only a simulated tomb. My own\r\nimpression would be in favour of the latter hypothesis, inasmuch as a\r\ntrue and a false tomb are characteristic of all similar monuments. In\r\nthe pyramids of Egypt they coexisted. In every Buddhist tope, without\r\nexception, there is a Tee, which is in every case we know only a\r\nsimulated relic-casket. Originally it may have been the place where\r\nthe relic was deposited, and as we know of instances where relics\r\nwere exposed to the crowd on certain festivals, it is difficult to\r\nunderstand where they were kept, except in some external case like\r\nthis. In every instance, however, in which a relic has been found it\r\nhas been in the centre of the Tope and never in the Tee. A still more\r\napposite illustration, however, is found in the tombs around Agra and\r\nDelhi. In all those of any pretension the body is buried in the earth\r\nin a vault below the floor of the tomb and a gravestone laid over it,\r\nbut on the floor of the chamber, under the dome, there is always a\r\nsimulated sarcophagus, which is the only one seen by visitors. This\r\nis carried even further in the tomb of the Great Akbar (1556, 1605).\r\nOver the vault is raised a pyramid surrounded, not like this tumulus by\r\nthree rows of stones, but by three rows of pavilions, and on the top,\r\nexposed to the air, is a simulated tomb placed exactly as this dolmen\r\nis. No two buildings could well seem more different at first sight, but\r\ntheir common parentage and purpose can hardly be mistaken, and it must\r\nbe curious to know whether the likeness extends to the double tomb also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 9. Tee cut in the Rock on Dagoba at Ajunta.]\r\n\r\nThis, like many other questions, must be left to the spade to\r\ndetermine, but, unless attention is turned to the analogy above alluded\r\nto, the purpose of the double tomb may be misunderstood, even when\r\nfound, and frequently, I suspect, has already been mistaken for a\r\nsecondary interment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCLES.\r\n\r\nCircles form another group of the monuments we are about to treat of,\r\nin this country more important than the dolmens to which the last\r\nsection was devoted. In France, however, they are hardly known, though\r\nin Algeria they are very frequent. In Denmark and Sweden they are both\r\nnumerous and important, but it is in the British Islands that circles\r\nattained their greatest development, and assumed the importance they\r\nmaintain in all the works of our antiquaries which treat of megalithic\r\nart.\r\n\r\nThe cognate examples in the microlithic styles afford us very little\r\nassistance in determining either the origin or use of this class of\r\nmonument. It might, nay has been suggested, that the podium which\r\nsurmounts such a tumulus, for instance, that of the Cocumella (woodcut\r\nNo. 5) would, if the mound were removed, suggest, or be suggested,\r\nby the stone circles of our forefathers. This podium, however, seems\r\nalways to have been a purely constructive expedient, without any mystic\r\nor religious significance, for unless the base of an earthen mound is\r\nconfined by a revêtement of this sort it is apt to spread, and then the\r\nwhole monument loses that definition which is requisite to dignity.\r\n\r\nThe Rails of the Indian Buddhists at first sight seem to offer a more\r\nplausible suggestion of origin, but it is one on which it would be\r\ndangerous in the present state of our knowledge to rely too much; if\r\nfor no other reason, for the one just given, that up to the time of\r\nAsoka, B.C. 250, they, like all the architecture of India,\r\nwere in wood and wood only. Stone as a building material, either rude\r\nor hewn, was unknown in that country till apparently it was suggested\r\nto them by the Bactrian Greeks. Unless, therefore, we are prepared to\r\nadmit that all our stone circles are subsequent, by a considerable\r\ninterval of time, to the epoch of Asoka, they were not derived from\r\nIndia. My own impression is that all may ultimately prove to have been\r\nerected subsequently to the Christian Era, but till that is established\r\nwe must look elsewhere than to India for our original form, and even\r\nthen we have only got a possible analogy; and nothing approaching to a\r\nproof that any connexion existed between them.\r\n\r\nThe process in this country, so far as I can make out, was different,\r\nthough tending to a similar result. The stone circles in Europe appear\r\nto have been introduced in supercession to the circular earthen mounds\r\nwhich surround the early tumuli of our Downs. These earthen enclosures\r\nstill continued to be used, surrounding stone monuments of the latest\r\nages, but, if I mistake not, they first gave rise to the form itself.\r\nSuch a circle, for instance, as that called the Nine Ladies on Stanton\r\nMoor, I take to be a transitional example. The circular mound, which is\r\n38 feet in diameter, enclosed a sepulchral tumulus, as was, no doubt,\r\nthe case from time immemorial, but, in this instance, was further\r\nadorned and dignified by the circle of stones erected upon it. A\r\ncentury or so afterwards, when stone had become more recognized as a\r\nbuilding material, the circular mound may have been disused, and then\r\nthe stone circle would alone remain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 10. Nine Ladies, Stanton Moor. From a drawing by L.\r\nJewitt.]\r\n\r\nThese stone circles are found enclosing tumuli, as in the Dolmen de\r\nBousquet (woodcut No. 8), in three rows, and sometimes five or seven\r\nrows are found. They frequently also enclose dolmens, either standing\r\non the level plain or on tumuli, but often, especially in this country,\r\nthey are found enclosing nothing that can be seen above ground. This\r\nhas led to the assumption that they are \"Things,\" comitia--or places\r\nof assembly--or, still more commonly, that they are temples, though,\r\nnow that the Druidical theory is nearly abandoned, no one has been able\r\nto suggest to what religion they are, or were, dedicated. The spade,\r\nhowever, is gradually dispelling all these theories. Out of say 200\r\nstone circles which are found in these islands, at least one-half, on\r\nbeing dug out, have yielded sepulchral deposits. One-quarter are still\r\nuntouched by the excavator, and the remainder which have not yielded up\r\ntheir secret are mostly the larger circles. Their evidence, however, is\r\nat best only negative, for, till we know exactly where to dig, it would\r\nrequire that the whole area should be trenched over before we can feel\r\nsure we had not missed the sepulchral deposit. When, as at Avebury,\r\nthe circle encloses an area of 28 acres,[65] and the greater part of\r\nit is occupied by a village, no blind digging is likely to lead to any\r\nresult, or can be accepted as evidence.\r\n\r\nStill the argument would be neither illegitimate nor illogical if, in\r\nthe present state of the evidence, it were contended that all stone\r\ncircles, up say to 100 feet diameter, were sepulchral, as nine-tenths\r\nof them have been proved to be, but that the larger circles were\r\ncenotaphic, or, if another expression is preferred, temples dedicated\r\nto the honour or worship of the dead, but in which no bodies were\r\nburied. But to admit--and it cannot now be denied--that all circles up\r\nto 100 feet are sepulchral, yet to assert that above that dimension\r\nthey became temples dedicated to the sun, or serpents, or demons,\r\nor Druids, without any other change of plan or design but increased\r\ndimensions, appears a wholly untenable proposition.\r\n\r\nAll this will, it is hoped, be made more clear in the sequel when we\r\ncome to examine particular examples, regarding which it is more easy to\r\nreason than merely from general principles; but in the meanwhile there\r\nis one other peculiarity which should be pointed out before proceeding\r\nfurther. It is that where great groups of circles are found, they--so\r\nfar as is at present known--never mark cemeteries where successive\r\ngenerations of kings or chiefs were buried, but battle-fields. The\r\ncircles, or dolmens, or cairns grouped in these localities seem always\r\nto have been erected by their comrades, to the memory of those who\r\non these spots \"fiercely fighting, fell,\" and are monuments as well\r\nof the prowess of the survivors as of those who were less fortunate.\r\nThe proof of this also must depend on individual examples to be\r\nbrought forward in the following pages. It does not, however, seem to\r\npresent much difficulty, the principal point in the argument being\r\nthat they are generally found in solitary places far removed from the\r\ncentres of population, or are sometimes single and that they show no\r\nprogression. Had they been cemeteries or sepulchres of kings, several\r\nwould undoubtedly have been found grouped together; progression and\r\nindividuality would have been observed; and lastly, they are just such\r\nmonuments as an army could erect in a week or a month, but which the\r\ninhabitants of the spot could not erect in years, and could not use for\r\nany conceivable purpose when erected.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVENUES.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat unfortunate that no recognized name has yet been hit\r\nupon for this class of monument. Alignment has been suggested, but the\r\nterm is hardly applicable to two rows of stones, for instance, leading\r\nto a circle. Parallellitha is, at best, a barbarous compound, and as\r\nsuch better avoided. Though therefore, the word avenues can hardly be\r\ncalled appropriate to rows of stones leading from nowhere to no place,\r\nand between which there is no evidence that anybody ever was intended\r\nto walk, still it seems the least objectionable expression that has yet\r\nbeen hit upon, and as such it will be used throughout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 11. Chambered Tumulus, Jersey.]\r\n\r\nThese avenues are of two classes. First, those leading to circles.\r\nAbout the origin of this class there can be very little hesitation.\r\nThey represent externally the passages in tumuli which lead to\r\nthe central chamber; take, for instance, this example from a now\r\ndestroyed[66] tumulus near St. Helier, in Jersey.[67] The circular\r\nchamber was 24 feet in diameter, and contained originally seven little\r\ncells, each roofed by a single slab of stone. This circular area was\r\napproached by an avenue, 17 feet long at the time of its destruction,\r\nwhich was roofed throughout the whole length with slabs of stone. The\r\ncentral chamber never, however, appears to have been vaulted, so that\r\naccess to the tombs through this passage could never have been possible\r\nafter the mound was finished. The chamber was found filled with earth,\r\nand the whole monument covered up by a tumulus of considerable extent.\r\nIt need hardly be observed that it is more unlikely that any people\r\nshould cover up such a monument at any subsequent age, than that\r\nthey should dig out such monuments and leave them standing without\r\ntheir envelopes, as is so generally assumed. The tumulus was removed,\r\nbecause the officer in command of the neighbouring fort wanted a level\r\nparade-ground. As it stood uncovered it was a miniature Avebury, and\r\nthe position of its cells may give us a hint where the bodies may be\r\nfound there--near the outer circle of stones, where they have not\r\nbeen looked for. But of this hereafter. It is meanwhile evident that\r\nwhile these monuments were in course of erection they stood as shown\r\nin the last woodcut, and it is also tolerably clear that when people\r\nbecame familiar with their aspect in this state, they may have learned\r\nto regret hiding under a heap of earth what we certainly would have\r\nthought more interesting as it was. In like manner, as John Stuart well\r\nremarks, \"If the cairns at New Grange were removed, the pillars would\r\nform another Callernish.\"[68] It is true, however, that if the Jersey\r\nmonument is the type of Avebury, the latter must be comparatively\r\nmodern, as a coin of Claudius, found in one of the cells at St.\r\nHelier,[69] probably fixes its date. Again, as we expect to be able to\r\nprove that New Grange is subsequent to the Christian era, Callernish\r\nmust be more modern also. Be this as it may, I think there can be very\r\nlittle doubt that these exposed circles, with their avenues, took their\r\nrise, as in the case of dolmens, from people becoming familiar with\r\ntheir forms before they were covered up, and eventually reconciling\r\nthemselves to dispense with the envelope. In the case of the circles,\r\nthe new plan was capable of infinitely greater extension than in that\r\nof the dolmens; but the process seems to have been the same in both\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Jersey circle, if any one will compare it with the\r\nchamber at Mycenæ (woodcut No. 4), they can hardly fail to perceive\r\nthe close similarity and probable identity of destination that exists\r\nbetween them; but as the island example is very much ruder, according\r\nto the usual reasoning it must be the more ancient of the two. This,\r\nhowever, is the capital fallacy which has pervaded all reasoning on\r\nthe subject hitherto. It is true that nothing can be more interesting\r\nor more instructive than to trace the progress of the Classical, the\r\nMediæval, and the Indian styles through their ever-changing phases,\r\nor to watch the influence which one style had on the other. That\r\nprogress was, however, always confined within the limits of a nation,\r\nor community of nations, and the influence limited to such nations\r\nas from similarity of race or constant intercourse were in position\r\nto influence reciprocally not only the architecture, but their arts\r\nand feelings. In order to establish this in the present instance,\r\nwe must prove that there was such community of race and frequency\r\nof intercourse between the Channel Islands and Greece 1000 years\r\nB.C., that the latter would copy the other, or rather that\r\n2000 years B.C. the Channel Islanders gave the Greeks those\r\nhints which they were enabled to elaborate, and of which the chambers\r\nat Mycenæ about the time of the Trojan war were the result. Had this\r\nbeen the case the influence could hardly have ceased as civilization\r\nand intercourse with other countries increased, and we ought to find\r\nTholoi in great perfection in these islands, and probably temples and\r\narts in all the perfection to which they were afterwards expanded in\r\nGreece. In fact, we get into such a labyrinth of conjecture, that no\r\nescape seems possible. It would be almost as reasonable to argue that\r\nthe images on Easter Island, which we know continued to be carved in\r\nour day, were prehistoric, because they are so much ruder than the\r\nworks of Phidias. The truth is, that where we cannot trace community\r\nof race or religion, accompanied by constant and familiar intercourse,\r\nwe must take each people as doing what their state of civilization\r\nenabled them to accomplish, wholly irrespective of what was doing or\r\nhad been done by any other people in any other part of the world. All\r\nthat it is necessary to assume in this case is, that a dead-revering\r\nancestral-worshipping people wished to do honour to the departed, as\r\nthey knew or heard was done by other races of their family of mankind\r\nelsewhere, and that they did it in the best manner the state of the\r\narts among them admitted of--rudely, if they were in a low state of\r\ncivilization, and more perfectly if they had advanced beyond that stage\r\nin which rude forms could be tolerated.\r\n\r\nIt is much more difficult to trace the origin of the avenues which are\r\nnot attached to circles, and do not lead to any important monuments.\r\nNothing that is buried at all resembles them in form, and no erections\r\nin the corresponding microlithic style, either in the Mediterranean\r\ncountries or in India, afford any hints which would enable us to\r\nsuggest their purpose. We are thus left to guess at their uses solely\r\nfrom the evidence which can be gathered from their own form and\r\nposition, and from such traditions as may exist; and these, it seems,\r\nhave not hitherto been deemed sufficient to establish even a plausible\r\nhypothesis capable of explaining their intention.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, such an example as the parallel lines of stones\r\nnear Merivale Bridge on Dartmoor. They certainly do not form a temple\r\nin any sense in which that word is understood by any other people or in\r\nany age with which we are acquainted. They are not procession paths,\r\ninasmuch as both ends are blocked up; and, though it is true the sides\r\nare all doors, we cannot conceive any procession moving along their\r\nnarrow gangway, hardly three feet in width. The stones that compose\r\nthe sides are only two and three feet high; so that, even if placed\r\nside by side, they would not form a barrier, and, being three to six\r\nfeet apart, they are useless except to form an \"alignment.\" There is no\r\nplace for an image, no sanctuary or cell; nothing, in fact, that can be\r\nconnected with any religious ceremonial.\r\n\r\nIf the inhabitants of the place had really wanted a temple, in any\r\nsense in which we understand the term, there is a magnificent tor,\r\na few hundred yards off to the northward, where Nature has disposed\r\nsome magnificent granite blocks so as to form niches such as human\r\nhands could with difficulty imitate. All that was wanted was to move\r\nthe smaller blocks, lying loose in front of it, a few yards to the\r\nright or left, and dispose them in a semicircle or rectangular form,\r\nand they would have one of the most splendid temples in England in\r\nwhich to worship the images which Cæsar tells us they possessed.[70]\r\nThey, however, did nothing of the kind. They went to a bare piece of\r\nmoorland, where there were no stones, and brought those we find there,\r\nand arranged them as shown on the plan; and for what purpose?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 12. AVENUES, CIRCLES AND CROMLECH, NEAR MERIVALE BRIDGE,\r\nDARTMOOR. From a drawing by Sir Gardner Wilkinson.]\r\n\r\nThe only answer to the question that occurs to me is that these\r\nstones are intended to represent an army, or two armies, drawn up in\r\nbattle array; most probably the former, as we can hardly understand\r\nthe victorious army representing the defeated as so nearly equal to\r\nthemselves. But if we consider them as the first and second line,\r\ndrawn up to defend the village in their rear--which is an extensive\r\nsettlement--the whole seems clear and intelligible. The circle in front\r\nwould then represent the grave of a chief; the long stone, 40 yards in\r\nfront, the grave of another of the \"menu\" people; and the circles and\r\ncromlech in front of the first line the burying-places of those who\r\nfell there.\r\n\r\nThere is another series of avenues at Cas Tor, on the western edge of\r\nDartmoor,[71] some 600 yards in length, which is quite as like a battle\r\narray as this, but more complex and varied in plan. It bends round the\r\nbrow of the hill, so that neither of the ends can be seen from the\r\nother, or, indeed, from the centre; and it is as unlike a temple or\r\nanything premeditated architecturally as this one at Merivale Bridge.\r\nThere are several others on Dartmoor, all of the same character, and\r\nnot one from which it seems possible to extract a religious idea.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of the great groups of stones in England and France, we\r\nshall frequently have to return to this idea, though then basing it on\r\ntraditional and other grounds; but, meanwhile, what is there to be said\r\nagainst it? It is perhaps not too much to say that in all ages and in\r\nall countries soldiers have been more numerous than priests, and men\r\nhave been prouder of their prowess in war than of their proficiency in\r\nfaith. They have spent more money for warlike purposes than ever they\r\ndevoted to the service of religion, and their pæans in honour of their\r\nheroes have been louder than their hymns in praise of their gods. Yet\r\nhow was a rude, illiterate people, who could neither read nor write,\r\nto hand down to posterity a record of its victories? A mound, such as\r\nwas erected at Marathon or at Waterloo, is at best a dumb witness. It\r\nmay be a sepulchre, as Silbury Hill was supposed to be; it may be the\r\nfoundation of a caer, or fort, as many of those in England certainly\r\nwere; it may be anything, in short. But a savage might very well\r\nargue: \"When any one sees how and where our men were drawn up when we\r\nslaughtered our enemies, can he be so stupid as not to perceive that\r\nhere we stood and fought and conquered, and there our enemies were\r\nslain or ran?\" We, unfortunately, have lost the clue that would tell\r\nus who \"we\" and \"they\" were in the instance of the Dartmoor stones at\r\nleast; but uncultivated men do not take so mean a view of their own\r\nimportance as to fancy this possible.\r\n\r\nThis theory has at least the merit of accounting for all the facts\r\nat present known, and of being at variance with none, which is more\r\nthan can be said for any other that has hitherto been proposed. Till,\r\ntherefore, something better is brought forward, it must be allowed\r\nto stand at least as a basis to reason upon, in order to explain the\r\nmonuments we have to describe in the following pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENHIRS.\r\n\r\nThe Menhirs, or tall stones,[72] form the last of the classes into\r\nwhich we have thought it necessary for the present, at least, to\r\ndivide the remains of which we are now treating. They occur in all the\r\nmegalithic districts, but from their very singleness and simplicity,\r\nit is almost more difficult to ascertain their purpose than it is\r\nthat of any more complicated monuments; nor do the analogies from\r\nthe cognate microlithic styles help us much. The stones mentioned in\r\nthe early books of the Old Testament, though often pressed into the\r\nservice, were all too small to bear any resemblance to those we are\r\nnow concerned with. Neither Greece nor Etruria help us in the matter,\r\nand though it is true that the Buddhists in India, from Asoka's time\r\ndownward, were in the habit of setting up Lâts or Stambas, it seems\r\nwith them to have been always, or nearly so, for the purpose of bearing\r\ninscriptions, which is certainly not a distinguishing characteristic\r\nof our Menhirs. It is true that we have in Scotland two stones. The\r\nCat stone near Edinburgh, bearing the name of Vetta, the grandson of\r\nHengist (who probably was slain in battle there),[73] and the Newton\r\nstone in Garioch, which is still unread. We have also one in France\r\nnear Brest,[74] equally illegible, and no doubt others exist. Perhaps\r\nthese may be considered as early lispings of an infant, which certainly\r\nare the preludes of perfect speech, and only to be found where that\r\npower of words must afterwards exist. Here the analogy is, to say the\r\nleast of it, remote.\r\n\r\nThere also are, especially in Ireland, but also in Wales and in\r\nScotland, a great number of stones with Ogham inscriptions. So far as\r\nthese have been made out they seem to be mere head-stones of graves,\r\nintimating that A, the son of B, lies buried there. A custom, it\r\nneed hardly be observed, that continues to the present day in every\r\ncemetery in the land. The fact seems to be that so soon as the use of\r\nstone was suggested and men were sufficiently advanced to be able to\r\nengrave Oghams, it was at once perceived that a stone pillar with an\r\ninscription upon it was not only a more durable but a more intelligent\r\nand intelligible record of a man's life or death than a simple mound\r\nof \"undistinguishable earth.\" It in consequence rapidly superseded the\r\nbarrow, and has continued in use to the present time, and been adopted\r\nby both Christians and Mahomedans, by all, in fact, who bury, as\r\ncontradistinguished from those who burn their dead.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the story of the stones is slightly different. A great\r\nmany of these are no doubt cat stones or battle memorials, but as they\r\nhave not even Ogham inscriptions, they tell no tale. It is doubtful,\r\nindeed, if an Ogham inscription could describe a battle, or anything\r\nmore complex than a genealogy, and still more so if it did whether we\r\ncould read it. But without it how can we say what they are? If, for\r\ninstance, the battle of Largs had not been fought in historic times,\r\nhow could we tell that the tall stone that now marks the spot was\r\nerected in the thirteenth century? Or how, indeed, can we feel sure of\r\nthe history of any one? By degrees, however, in Scotland they faded\r\ninto those wonderful sculptured stones which form so marked and so\r\npeculiar a feature of Pictland. Whether we shall ever get a key to the\r\nhieroglyphics with which these stones are covered is by no means clear,\r\nbut even if we do they probably will not tell us much. They certainly\r\ncontain neither names nor dates, but even now their succession can be\r\nmade out with tolerable distinctness. The probability seems to be that\r\nthe figures on them are tribal marks or symbols of rank, and, as such,\r\nwould convey very little information if capable of being read.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to trace the perfectly plain obelisk being developed\r\ninto such as the Newton stones, which have only one or two Pagan\r\nsymbols, but are certainly subsequent to the Christian era. From\r\nthese we advance to those on the back of which the Christian cross\r\ntimidly appears, and which certainly date after St. Columba's time\r\n(A.D. 563), and from that again to the erection of Sweno's\r\nstone, near Forres, in the first years of the eleventh century, where\r\nthe cross occupies the whole of the rear, and an elaborate bas-relief\r\nsupersedes the rude symbols in the front.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the rude stones do not appear to have gone through the\r\n\"symbol stage,\" but early to have ripened into the sculptured cross,\r\nfor it was not from a timidly engraved cross as in Scotland that\r\nthey took their origin. The Irish crosses at once boldly adopted the\r\ncross-arms, surrounded by a glory, with the other characteristics of\r\nthat beautiful and original class of Christian monuments.\r\n\r\nIn France the menhir was early adopted by the Christians; so early\r\nthat it has generally been assumed that those examples which we see\r\nsurmounted by a cross were pagan monuments, on which at some subsequent\r\ntime Christians have added a cross. This, however, certainly does not\r\nappear to have been always the case. In such a cross, for instance, as\r\nthat at Lochcrist, the menhir and the cross are one, and made for one\r\nanother, and similar examples occur at Cape St. Matthieu, at Daoulas,\r\nand in other places in Brittany.[75] In France the menhir, after being\r\nadopted by the Christians, does not seem to have passed through the\r\nsculptured stage[76] common to crosses in Scotland and Ireland, but\r\nto have bloomed at once into the Calvary so frequent in Brittany.\r\nHere the cross stands out as a tall tree, and the figures are grouped\r\nround its base, but how early this form was adopted we have no means of\r\nknowing.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark the modern history of the Bauta stones, as the grave or\r\nbattle stones are there called, is somewhat different. They early\r\nreceived a Runic as the Irish received an Ogham inscription, but\r\nDenmark was converted at so late an age to Christianity (the eleventh\r\ncentury) that her menhirs never passed through the early Christian\r\nstage, but from Pagan monuments sank at once into modern gravestones,\r\nwith prosaic records of the birth and death of the dead man whose\r\nmemory they were erected to preserve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13. Lochcrist Menhir.]\r\n\r\nIn all these instances we can trace back the history of the menhirs\r\nfrom historic Christian times to non-historic regions when these rude\r\nstone pillars, with or without still ruder inscriptions, were gradually\r\nsuperseding the earthen tumuli as a record of the dead. It is as yet\r\nuncertain whether we can follow back their history with anything like\r\ncertainty beyond the Christian era. This, however, is just the task to\r\nwhich antiquaries should address themselves. Instead of reasoning as\r\nhitherto from the unknown to the known, it would be infinitely more\r\nphilosophical to reason from the known backwards. By proceeding in this\r\nmanner every step we make is a positive gain, and eventually may lead\r\nus to write with certainty about things that now seem enveloped in mist\r\nand obscurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 42: It is so curious as almost to justify Piazzi Smyth's\r\n    wonderful theories on the subject.

While, however, everything\r\nconcerning them is considered as uncertain--in fact, as unknown, such\r\na mode of treatment, though satisfactory to believers, would fail\r\nto carry conviction to the minds of those who doubt. It appears,\r\ntherefore, that under the circumstances a preferable mode will be to\r\ntake three or four of the principal and best known British groups,\r\nand to subject them to a tolerably exhaustive examination. If it is\r\npossible to dispel the errors that have grown up around them, and to\r\nfix their uses and dates on anything like a reasonable basis, the\r\nrest will be easy; but so long as men believe in Druids or Dragons,\r\nor even think it necessary to relegate these monuments to prehistoric\r\nantiquity, it is useless to reason regarding them. By the process it\r\nis proposed to follow, it is hoped at least to be able to dispel these\r\nmists. Others must judge whether the landscape their dispersion will\r\nreveal is either real, or pleasing to contemplate.\r\n\r\nThe first monument we propose selecting for examination is Avebury,\r\nas the largest, and in some respects the most important of the class\r\nin this country. Stonehenge might at first sight seem to have equal\r\nclaims to precedence, but it is exceptional. It is the only hewn stone\r\nmonument we possess, the only one where trilithons are found with\r\nhorizontal architraves, and where the outer circle also possesses\r\nthese imposts. It is, in fact, the megalithic monument which exhibits\r\nthe most civilized forms, and to prove its age and use would not\r\nnecessarily prove those of any rude stone monument found elsewhere.\r\nAvebury, on the contrary, though larger than the others, is constructed\r\non precisely the same principle. It has the enclosing vallum, with its\r\nditch inside, like Arborlow, Marden, Arthur's round table, at Penrith,\r\nand others we shall meet with further on, while its circle and avenues\r\nare identical, as far as we can judge, with numerous examples found\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, proceeding to reason about Avebury, the first point\r\nis to ascertain what the group really consists of, which is a much\r\nmore difficult task than would at first sight appear. Stukeley has\r\nintroduced so many of his own fancies into his description of the\r\nplace, and they have been so implicitly followed by all who have since\r\nwritten on the subject, that it is now no easy task to get back to the\r\noriginal form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 14. View of Avebury restored. _a._ Silbury Hill. _b._\r\nWaden Hill.]\r\n\r\nThe principal monument at Avebury consists of a vallum of earth nearly,\r\nbut not quite, circular in form, with an average diameter of about\r\n1200 feet. Close on the edge of its internal ditch stood a circle\r\napparently originally consisting of about 100 stones, with a distance\r\nconsequently of about 33 feet from centre to centre. Inside this were\r\ntwo other double circles, placed not in the axis of the great one,\r\nbut on its north-eastern side. The more northern one was apparently\r\n350 feet in diameter, the other 325 feet.[77] In the centre of the\r\nnorthern one stood what is here called a cove, apparently consisting\r\nof three upright stones supporting a cap-stone--a dolmen, in fact,\r\nsuch as we shall frequently meet with in the following pages. In the\r\nsouthern circle there was only one stone obelisk or menhir. These facts\r\nwe gather from Stukeley and Colt Hoare, for all is now so completely\r\nruined and destroyed, that without their description no one could now\r\nmake even an approximate plan of the place. The stones that comprise\r\nthese inner as well as the outer circle are all the native Sarsens,\r\nwhich occur everywhere on these downs. In some places, such as Clatford\r\nBottom, about a mile from Avebury, they lie still in numbers sufficient\r\nto erect a dozen Aveburys, and many are still to be seen in the Bottoms\r\nto the southward, and indeed in every place where they have not been\r\nutilized by modern civilization. No mark of a chisel is to be seen\r\non any of the stones now standing here. For their effect they depend\r\nwholly on their mass, and that is so great as to produce an impression\r\nof power and grandeur which few of the more elaborate works of men's\r\nhands can rival.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15. Plan of Avebury Circle and Kennet Avenue, from Sir\r\nR. Colt Hoare.]\r\n\r\nFrom the outer vallum a stone avenue extended in a perfectly straight\r\nline for about 1430 yards, in a south-easterly direction. The centre\r\nwas apparently drawn from the centre of the great 1200 feet circle,\r\nnot from those of the smaller ones. This is called the Kennet\r\nAvenue, from its pointing towards the village of that name. I am\r\nextremely sceptical with regard to the existence of another, called\r\nthe Beckhampton Avenue, on which Dr. Stukeley lays so much stress.\r\nAubrey did not see it, though he saw the Long Stone Cove, the \"Devil's\r\nQuoits,\" as he called them; and Stukeley is obliged to admit that in\r\nhis day not one stone was standing.[78] It seems that here, as, indeed,\r\neverywhere over this country, a number of Sarsen stones were lying\r\nabout, and his fertile imagination manufactured them into the body of a\r\nsnake. None, however, are shown in Sir R. Colt Hoare's survey, and none\r\nexist now; and beyond the Cove even Stukeley admits that he drew the\r\nserpent's tail only because a serpent must have a termination of that\r\nsort. There were no stones to mark its form any more then than now. The\r\nfirst objection that appears against admitting the existence of the\r\nvery hypothetical avenue is, that no curved avenue of any sort is known\r\nto exist anywhere, or attached to any monuments. All the curves of the\r\nKennet avenue are the Doctor's own, introduced by him to connect the\r\nstraight-lined avenues which were drawn from the circle at Avebury, and\r\nthat on Hakpen Hill. There are none at Stanton Drew, or other places\r\nwhere he audaciously drew them. Near the church there are, or were,\r\ntwo stones placed in the opening like that called the Friar's Heel,\r\nand the prostrate stone at Stonehenge, but these are all that probably\r\never existed of the Beckhampton Avenue. The question is not, however,\r\nimportant. As there were two circles inside the Avebury vallum, there\r\nmay have been two avenues. All that is here contended for is, that\r\nthere is no proof of the existence of the second. A dolmen, called the\r\nLong Stone Cove, existed near where Stukeley draws its sinuous line,\r\nbut there is nothing to show that it ever formed any part of such an\r\nalignment; and around it there were some standing stones, or rather,\r\neven in Stukeley's time, stones which apparently had stood, but there\r\nis nothing to show whether forming part of a circle, or as detached\r\nmenhirs, or as parts of an avenue.\r\n\r\nThe second member of the Avebury group is the double circle, or rather\r\ndouble oval, on Hakpen hill--Haca's Pen;[79] this was, according to\r\nStukeley, 138 feet by 155 feet, and had an avenue 45 feet wide, as\r\ncompared with 51 feet which Sir R. C. Hoare gives for those of the\r\nKennet avenue of Avebury. The avenue is supposed to have extended in\r\na perfectly straight line for above a quarter of a mile, pointing\r\ndirectly towards Silbury Hill, which is about one mile and a quarter\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\nThe third member of the group is the famous Silbury Hill, about a mile\r\ndistant due south from Avebury. That these two last named are of the\r\nsame age, and part of one design, seems scarcely open to doubt; but it\r\nis quite an open question whether Haca's Pen belongs either to the same\r\nage or the same design. Its stones were very much smaller, its form\r\ndifferent, and its avenue pointing towards Silbury looks as if that\r\nmonument existed, and may have long existed before it was built; but of\r\nthis hereafter.\r\n\r\nBesides these three there are numerous barrows, both long and round, in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and British forts and villages; but these we propose\r\nto pass over at present, confining our attention in the first instance\r\nto the three monuments above enumerated.\r\n\r\nThe first question that arises on looking at such a structure as\r\nAvebury, is whether it is a temple at all. It has already been\r\nattempted in the preceding pages to show what the temples of Britain\r\nwere in the ages immediately succeeding the Roman occupation; but even\r\nif it is conceded that they were small basilicas, it will be contended\r\nthat this is no answer to the question. If Avebury, it will be said,\r\nis a temple, it belonged to a mysterious, mythical, prehistoric people\r\ncapable of executing such wonderful works before they came in contact\r\nwith the Romans, but who, strange to say, were incapable of doing\r\nanything after the civilizing touch of that great people had left them\r\nfeebler, and more ignorant than they were before!\r\n\r\nIf this question, What is Avebury? is addressed to one--brought up in\r\nthe Druidical faith as most Englishmen have been--he at once answers,\r\nIt is a temple of the Druids. If pressed and reminded of the groves\r\nand the oaks these sectaries delighted in, he will perhaps admit\r\nthat no soil is so little likely to grow oaks as the chalk downs of\r\nWiltshire, and that there is no proof that any oaks ever grew in the\r\nneighbourhood. But this is not a complete answer, for it may be\r\ncontended that for some reason we cannot comprehend, the Druids may\r\nhave dispensed with trees on this occasion. The real difficulty is, as\r\nbefore mentioned, that no stones or stone structures are ever mentioned\r\nin connection with Druids.\r\n\r\nIf an educated man whose mind is free from prejudice or pre-conceived\r\nideas is asked the question, he runs over in his own mind what he knows\r\nof the temples of other peoples--Egypt, Assyria, Greece, Rome, in the\r\nancient or the middle ages. They produced nothing of the sort. Persia,\r\nIndia, China, or the countries in the Eastern seas are all equally\r\nunsuggestive; nor will Mexico or Peru help him. The first conclusion,\r\ntherefore, that he inevitably arrives at is, if these were the temples\r\nof the Britons, they must indeed have been a \"Peculiar people,\" unlike\r\nany other race that lived at any time in any part of the world.\r\n\r\nIf they were temples, to what god or gods were they dedicated? It\r\ncould hardly have been Mercury, or Apollo, or Mars, Jove, or Minerva,\r\nmentioned by Cæsar,[80] as the gods worshipped by the Druids--and\r\nthough perhaps these were only the nearest synonyms of Roman gods\r\napplied to Celtic divinities, still there must have been such\r\nresemblances as to have justified these appellations. We know of what\r\nform the temples of these gods were, and certainly they were not built\r\nafter the fashion of the circles at Avebury. Some antiquaries have\r\ntimidly suggested a dedication to the Sun. But there is certainly no\r\npassage in any author, classical or mediæval, which would lead us to\r\nsuppose that our forefathers were addicted to the worship of a deity so\r\nunlikely to be a favourite in such a climate as ours. But again, what\r\nis a sun temple? Does one exist anywhere? Had the Wiltshire shepherds\r\nattempted it, they probably would have found the same difficulty that\r\nbeset the fire-worshipping Persians of old. It is not easy to get the\r\nsun into a temple fashioned by human hands, and his rays are far more\r\navailable on high places or on the sea-shore than inside walls or\r\nenclosures of any sort.\r\n\r\nEven putting aside the question to what god it was dedicated, what\r\nkind of worship could be performed in such a place? It could not be\r\nfor speaking in. Our largest cathedrals are 600 feet long, and no man\r\nwould attempt from the altar of the lady chapel to address a crowd\r\nbeyond the west door; still less would he in the open air attempt to\r\naddress a crowd in a circle 1200 feet in diameter, and where from the\r\nnature of the arrangements one half of the audience must be behind him.\r\nStill less is it fitted for seeing. The floor of the area is perfectly\r\nflat, and though people talk loosely of the crowd that could stand on\r\nthe vallum, or on the berm, or narrow ledge between the internal ditch\r\nand the foot of the rampart, they forget that only one row of persons\r\ncould stand on a sharp-pointed mound, and that the berm is on the same\r\nlevel as the rest of the floor, and is the last place any one would\r\nchoose, as 100 great stones were put up in front of it as if especially\r\ndesigned to obstruct the view. This was, in fact, the case with all the\r\nstones. Assuming the ceremony or action to take place in the centre\r\nof either of the two inner circles, the double row of stones which\r\nsurround them is so placed as to obstruct the view in every direction\r\nto the utmost possible extent. It may be suggested that the priest\r\nmight climb on to the cap-stone of the cove, in the northern circle,\r\nand there perform his sacrifice in sight of the assembled multitude. It\r\nwould be difficult to conceive any place so ill suited for the purpose;\r\nand even then, how would he manage on the point of the obelisk in the\r\ncentre of the southern circle? No place, in fact, can be so ill adapted\r\nfor either seeing or hearing as Avebury; and those who erected it would\r\nhave been below the capacity of ordinary idiots if they designed it for\r\neither purpose. Besides this, it has none of the ordinary adjuncts of a\r\ntemple. There is no sanctuary, no altar, no ark, no procession path, no\r\npriests' house, nothing that is found more or less prominently forming\r\na part of every temple in every part of the world.\r\n\r\nWhy so hypæthral? Are we to understand that the climate of the\r\nWiltshire downs is so perfect and equable that men can afford to\r\ndispense with roofs or the ordinary protection against weather? or are\r\nwe to assume that the men who could move these masses of stone and\r\nraise these mounds were such utter savages that they could not erect an\r\nenclosed building of any sort?\r\n\r\nEgypt possesses the finest and most equable climate in the world;\r\nyet all her temples are roofed in a more careful manner and more\r\nstately than our mediæval cathedrals, and so are all those of India\r\nand the Eastern climes where shelter is far less wanted than here.\r\nIn all these countries and climes the temples of the gods are the\r\ndwellings or halls of men, enlarged and improved. What they did well\r\nfor themselves, they did better for their deities. Are men therefore to\r\nassume that the Wiltshire shepherd slept on the snow in winter, with\r\nno other protection than a circle of widely spaced stones, and had no\r\nidea of a roof? Yet, if he were not hardened by some such process, it\r\nis difficult to see why he should build a temple so exposed to the\r\ninclemency of the weather that no ceremony could be properly performed\r\nin it for one half of the days of the year.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to the temple theory that would strike most people,\r\nif they would think about it, is the enormous size of Avebury. Its area\r\nis at least five times that of St. Peter's at Rome; 250,000 people\r\ncould easily be seated within its vallum, and half a million could\r\nstand. Men generally try to adapt the size of their buildings to the\r\namount of accommodation required. But where should such a multitude\r\nas this come from? How could they be fed? How could they be lodged?\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that in any ancient time before the\r\nintroduction of agriculture, the pastoral population on these downs\r\ncould ever have been greater than, or so great as, that which now\r\nexists there. When Doomsday Book was compiled, there were only two\r\nhides of arable land in the manor, and they seem to have belonged to\r\nthe church. A fair inference from which seems to be that, but for the\r\nsuperior knowledge and influence of the priesthood, the inhabitants of\r\nthese downs might, in the eleventh century, have remained in the same\r\nstate of pastoral barbarity in which there is every reason to believe\r\nthey were sunk in pagan times. How a few shepherds, sparsely scattered\r\nover these plains, could have erected or have required such a temple as\r\nthis, is the mystery that requires to be explained. A very small parish\r\nchurch now suffices for their spiritual wants; and if 10,000 pilgrims,\r\neven at the present day, when agriculture has been extended to every\r\navailable patch of ground, visited the place for a week, many of them\r\nwould be starving before it was over.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to adduce fifty other arguments of this sort. Many\r\nmore must indeed occur to any one who will give himself the trouble\r\nto think of the matter; but to those who are accustomed to such\r\ninvestigations the two most convincing probably are, first, that there\r\nis no evidence whatever of progress in the design of Avebury. It was\r\nbuilt and finished as first designed. The second is, that in it there\r\nis a total absence of ornament. In India, we have temples as big as\r\nAvebury; but their history is written on their faces. The first step in\r\nthe process is generally that a small shrine, with a narrow enclosure\r\nand small gateway, becomes from some cause or other, sacred or rich,\r\nand a second enclosure is added to contain halls for the reception of\r\npilgrims or the ceremonial display on festal occasions. But no god in\r\nthat pantheon can live alone. New shrines are added for other deities,\r\nwith new halls, new residences for priests, and more accommodation for\r\nall the thousand and one requisites of a great idol establishment. This\r\nrequires a third or fourth new enclosure, up even to a seventh, as at\r\nSeringham. But in all this there is progress: 200 or 300 years are\r\nrequired, and each century--sometimes each decade--leaves its easily\r\nrecognised mark as the work progresses. In like manner, the great\r\ntemple at Karnac, though covering only one-third the area of Avebury,\r\ntook the Egyptians three centuries to build, and every step of its\r\nprogress can be easily traced. The works of the earlier Thotmes differ\r\nessentially from those of Manepthah and Rameses, and theirs again from\r\nthose of Seshonk; and these again differ essentially from the little\r\nshrine of Osortasen, which was the germ of the whole.\r\n\r\nSo it was with all our cathedrals. The small Saxon church was\r\nsuperseded by the Norman nave with a small apsidal choir. This was\r\nenlarged into the Early English presbytery, and beyond this grew\r\nthe lady chapel, and as the ill-built Norman work decayed, it was\r\nreplaced by Tudor constructions. But there is nothing of the sort at\r\nAvebury. Had the temple been built or begun by the sparse inhabitants\r\nof these downs, we should have seen something to show where the work\r\nbegan. They must have brought one stone one year and another the\r\nnext, and inevitably they would have employed their leisure hours,\r\nlike the inhabitants of Easter Island, in carving these stones either\r\nwith ornaments or symbols, or fashioning them into idols. There is\r\nabsolutely no instance in the whole world where some evidence of care\r\nand of a desire after ornament of some sort is not to be traced in\r\nthe temples of the people. Nothing, however, of the sort occurs here.\r\nIndeed, if there is one thing more evident than another about Avebury,\r\nit is that, as it was begun, so it was ended. There is no hesitation,\r\nno sign of change: the same men, to all appearance, who traced its plan\r\nsaw its completion; and as they designed it, so they left it. There is\r\nno sign of any human hand having touched it from that hour henceforward\r\ntill the sordid greed of modern farmers set to work to destroy it,\r\nto build with its materials the alehouse and the village which now\r\noccupies a small portion of the enclosure.\r\n\r\nSo too with regard to ornament. This structure, we may fairly assume,\r\nif a temple, must have been in use for some centuries; but during that\r\ntime, or any shorter time that may be assumed, no man had the skill\r\nor the inclination to adorn the greatest temple of his native land\r\neither with carving or emblems or ornament of any kind. The men who\r\ncould conceive the great design--so great and noble--could do nothing\r\nmore. Their hands drooped in listless idleness by their sides, and they\r\nwere incapable of further exertion! Such a state of affairs, if not\r\nimpossible, is certainly unparalleled. No such example exists anywhere\r\nelse with reference to any temple, so far as we know, in any part of\r\nthe world. Tombs do show these peculiarities at times, temples never.\r\n\r\nIf these reasons are sufficient to prove that Avebury was not a temple,\r\nthere are more than can be required, to show that it was not a place\r\nof meeting of ancient Britons. Whatever may be thought of the extent\r\nof prehistoric assemblies, it will hardly be contended that it was\r\nnecessary to provide accommodation for the 250,000 men who could be\r\nseated in the great circle. Even supposing it were intended only to\r\naccommodate 12,000 or 13,000 lords and as many commons in the two\r\nsubordinate rings, they would hardly have arranged an inner circle\r\nof great stones in the middle of each assembly, or placed a spiked\r\nobelisk for a woolsack in the one or a tall dolmen under or behind\r\nthe Speaker's chair in the other. Nothing in fact could be conceived\r\nso utterly unsuited for the purpose as these rings, and unless these\r\nprimeval men were very differently constituted from ourselves, any\r\nassembly of elder-men who were likely to meet at Avebury would have\r\npreferred a room however rude, and of one-hundredth part of the extent,\r\nfor their deliberations to the unsheltered and unsuitable magnificence\r\nof the Big Stones. Of course, among all rude people, and often also\r\namong those more civilized, open-air assemblies of the people will\r\ntake place; but then these will always be near the great centres\r\nof population. Men will go into the desert for religious purposes,\r\nbut they prefer talking politics nearer home. In some communities a\r\nCampus Martius or a Thing field may be set apart for the purpose;\r\nbut the first requisite of such a place of assembly is that it shall\r\nbe open and free from encumbrance of any sort. A Mote hill too, like\r\nthe terraced Tynwald Mount in the Isle of Man, is an intelligible\r\narrangement, not for a deliberative assembly, but as a rostrum from\r\nwhich to proclaim law. We can also understand why Shire courts should\r\nbe held on barrows, as seems often to have been the case. For here\r\nthe judge occupied a dignified position on the summit. His assessors\r\nstood behind him, and the pleaders and people in front. Instances\r\nare also known in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries where local\r\ncourts were summoned to meet at the \"standing stones,\" or in circles,\r\nin Scotland at least;[81] but in all these instances it was apparently\r\nto settle territorial disputes on the spot, and the stones or mounds\r\nwere merely indicated as well-known marks and, consequently, convenient\r\ntrysting-places. Even if this were not so, it would not be at all to\r\nbe wondered at that in the middle ages sepulchral circles or mounds\r\nwere habitually used as meeting-places. They were then old enough\r\nto be venerable; and their antiquity must have conferred on them a\r\ndignity suitable to the purpose, whatever their original destination\r\nmay have been. But all this is very different from erecting as a place\r\nof assembly so huge and inconvenient a place as Avebury is, and always\r\nmust have been.\r\n\r\nIt seems needless to follow this line of argument further, for unless\r\nit can be shown that the people who erected Avebury were so differently\r\nconstituted from ourselves that no reasoning derived from our\r\nexperience can be applied to them, the answer seems inevitable.\r\n\r\nThat no such Temple, nor has any such meeting-place, been built or\r\nattempted by any set of men in any part of the world. But is there\r\nany reason for supposing that the inhabitants of these downs differed\r\nso essentially from ourselves? Dr. Thurnam has examined with care\r\nsome hundreds of skulls gathered from the grave-mounds in this\r\nneighbourhood, and has published decades on decades of them.[82]\r\nYet the most learned craniologists cannot detect--except perhaps in\r\ndegree--any difference that would lead us to suppose that these ancient\r\nmen were not actuated by the same motives and governed by the same\r\nmoral influences as ourselves. If this is so, Avebury certainly was not\r\nerected either as a temple or a place of assembly, in any sense of the\r\nword which we can understand, and those who insist that it was either\r\nare bound to explain what the motives or objects could have been which\r\ninduced the inhabitants of the Wiltshire downs to act in a manner so\r\nentirely opposed to all we know of the actions or feelings of all other\r\nnations in all other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, Avebury was neither a temple nor a place of assembly,\r\nwhat was it? The answer does not seem far to seek. It must have been\r\na burying-place, but still not a cemetery in the ordinary sense of\r\nthe term. The inhabitants of these downs could never have required a\r\nbigger and more magnificent burying-place than any other community in\r\nGreat Britain, and must always have been quite unequal to raise such\r\na monument. But what is more important than this, a cemetery implies\r\nsuccession in time and gradations in rank, and this is exactly what\r\nis most conspicuously wanting at Avebury. It may be the monument of\r\none king or two kings, but it is not a collection of the monuments of\r\nindividuals of various classes in life, or of a series of individuals\r\nof the same rank, erected at different intervals of time. As before\r\nremarked, it is in one design--\"totus teres atque rotundus,\" erected\r\nwith no hesitation and no shadow of change.\r\n\r\nIf, however, we assume that Avebury was the burying-place of those who\r\nfell in a great battle fought on the spot, every difficulty seems\r\nat once to vanish. It is now admitted that men did bury in stone\r\ncircles or under dolmens, and beside head-stones and within earthen\r\nenclosures, and what we find here differs only in degree from what we\r\nfind elsewhere. It seems just such a monument as a victorious army of\r\nsay 10,000 men could, with their prisoners, erect in a week. The earth\r\nis light, and could easily be thrown up into the form of the vallum,\r\nand the Sarsen stones lay all over the downs, and all on a higher\r\nlevel than Avebury, which perhaps for that very reason is placed on\r\nthe lowest spot of ground in the neighbourhood. With a few rollers and\r\nropes, 10,000 men would very soon collect all the stones that ever\r\nstood there, and stick them up on their ends. They probably would have\r\nno skilled labour in their ranks, and no leisure, if they had, to\r\nemploy it in ornamentation of any sort. Without this, it is just such a\r\nmonument as might and would be raised by an illiterate army wishing to\r\nbury with honour those who had fallen in the fight, and having at the\r\nsame time no other means of leaving on the spot a record of their own\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nOn theoretical grounds, there seems to be no argument that can be urged\r\nagainst this view; and during the ten years that it has been constantly\r\nbefore the public none have been brought forward that deserve notice.\r\nIt is urged, however, that the evidence is not complete, and that\r\nnothing written serves to confirm this view. Those who make the\r\nobjection forget that one of the first conditions of the problem is\r\nthat those who erected such a monument should be illiterate. If they\r\ncould have written to any primeval 'Times,' they would not have taken\r\nsuch pains to lithograph their victory on the spot. Had they been able\r\neither to read or write, an inscription would have done more than the\r\n200 or 300 stones of Avebury; but because they could not write, they\r\nraised them, and, for that reason also, left us the problem of finding\r\nout why they did so.\r\n\r\nWe are not, however, wholly without evidence on this subject. Many\r\nyears ago Mr. Kemble printed a charter of King Athelstan, dated in 939,\r\nwhich, describing the boundaries of the manor of Overton, in which\r\nAvebury is situated, makes use of the following expression:--\"Then by\r\nCollas barrow, as far as the broad road to Hackpen, thence northward up\r\nalong the Stone row, thence to the burying-places.\"[83] It does not\r\nseem to be a matter of doubt that the stone row here mentioned is the\r\nKennet Avenue, nor that the burying-places (byrgelsas) are the Avebury\r\nrings; but it may be urged that the Saxon surveyor did not know what\r\nhe was talking about; and as, unfortunately, he does not say who were\r\nburied there, and gives no corroborative evidence, all we learn from\r\nthis is that they were so considered in the tenth century.\r\n\r\nSomething more tangible was nearly obtained shortly before Stukeley's\r\ntime, when Lord Stawell levelled the vallum next the church, where\r\nthe great barn now stands. The original surface of the ground was\r\n\"easily distinguishable by a black stratum of mould on the chalk. Here\r\nthey found large quantities of buck-horns, bones, oyster-shells, and\r\nwood-coals. An old man who was employed on the work says there was a\r\nquantity of a cartload of horns, that they were very rotten, and that\r\nthere were very many burned bones among them.\"[84] On the same page,\r\nDr. Stukeley adds: \"Besides some Roman coins accidentally found in and\r\nabout Abury, I was informed that a square bit of iron was taken up\r\nunder one of the great stones upon pulling it down.\" Other Roman coins\r\nhave, I understand, been found there since, but there is no authentic\r\nrecord of the fact which can be quoted. This is to be regretted; for\r\nthe presence, if ascertained, of these coins would go far to prove that\r\nthe erection of the monument was after their date, whatever that may be.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately no scientific man saw these bones, so no one was able\r\nto say whether they were human or not; but the presumption is that\r\nthey were, for why should burned bones of animals be placed in such\r\na situation? The answer to this is that the Wiltshire Archæological\r\nSociety have made some excavations at Avebury, and found nothing. In\r\n1865, they tapped the vallum in various places, and dug one trench to\r\nits centre, and, as they found nothing, concluded that nothing was\r\nto be found. But in a mound 4442 feet long, according to Sir R. Colt\r\nHoare, there must be many vacant spots, especially if the bodies were\r\nburnt; and such negative evidence cannot be considered as conclusive,\r\nnor as sufficient to disprove the evidence acquired in Lord Stawell's\r\ndiggings. Stukeley's honesty in recording facts of this sort is hardly\r\nto be suspected, though the inferences he draws from his facts are\r\ngenerally to be received with the extremest caution. The Society also\r\ndug in the centre of the northern circle, where the dolmen stood,\r\nand penetrated to the original chalk, but found nothing except the\r\nruins of the stones which had been destroyed by fire, and express\r\ngreat disappointment at finding \"no human bones whatever.\"[85] If the\r\nbodies were burnt--as we should be led to infer from what Lord Stawell\r\nfound under the vallum--what they probably would have found, had the\r\n\"Cove\" been complete, would have been a vase or urn with ashes. The\r\nbarbarians who destroyed the stones are scarcely likely to have spared\r\nso worthless a piece of crockery; and if it were broken at the time,\r\nit would be in vain a hundred years afterwards to look either for it\r\nor for bones that in all probability were never laid there. Nor need\r\nbetter results have been expected from their trench, 60 feet long. A\r\nman must know very exactly what he is looking for, and where to look\r\nfor it, who expects to find an object like an urn, a foot in diameter,\r\nin a 28-acre field. Judging from the experience obtained at Crichie, in\r\nScotland, where a funereal deposit was obtained at the foot of every\r\none of a circle of stones that stood inside a ditch like the internal\r\none at Avebury, it is there we should expect to find the deposit.[86]\r\nThat is just where nobody has thought of looking at Avebury, though\r\nnothing would be easier. There are fifty or sixty empty holes, and any\r\none might without difficulty be enlarged, and if there were a deposit\r\nat the foot of each, it would then inevitably be found.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo this we shall return presently. Meanwhile let us see what evidence,\r\nif any, is to be obtained from the circle on Hakpen Hill.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, this monument consists of two ovals, according to\r\nDr. Stukeley the outer one was 138 by 155 feet and the inner 45 by 51\r\nfeet. He does not give the dimensions of the stones; but Aubrey calls\r\nthem from 4 to 5 feet in height, which is confirmed by the Doctor's\r\nengraving; and, altogether, they do not seem to average one-quarter the\r\nsize of those at Avebury. Of the avenue, only four stones are shown in\r\nthe plan woodcut (No. 16), and the same number is shown in the view\r\n(plate xxi.). In both instances, the avenue is represented as perfectly\r\nstraight, and as trending rather to the southward of Silbury Hill.[87]\r\nIt extended, according to Aubrey, a quarter of a mile--say 440 yards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16. Circle on Hakpen Hill. From Stukeley.]\r\n\r\nThe most curious circumstance, however, connected with this circle is\r\nthat, at the distance of about 80 yards from the outer oval, there were\r\nfound two rows of skeletons, laid side by side, with their feet towards\r\nthe centre of the circles. In a curious letter, written by a Dr. Toope,\r\nof Oxford, dated 1st December, 1685, addressed to Mr. Aubrey, and\r\npublished by Sir R. Colt Hoare,[88] it is said:--\"I quickly perceived\r\nthem to be human.\" \"Next day dugg up many bushells, with which I made\r\na noble medicine. The bones are large and nearly rotten, but the teeth\r\nextream and wonderfully white. About 80 yards from where the bones were\r\nfound, is a temple 40 yards diameter, with another 15 yards; round\r\nabout bones layd so close that scul toucheth scul. Their feet all round\r\nturned towards the temple, 1 foot below the surface of the ground. At\r\nthe feet of the first order lay the head of the next row, the feet\r\nalways tending towards the temple.\" Further on Aubrey asserts that a\r\nditch surrounded the temple, which Stukeley denies; but there seems no\r\ndifficulty in reconciling the two statements. The destruction of the\r\nmonument had commenced before Aubrey's time. For it is impossible to\r\nconceive bodies lying for even 1000 or 1200 years in so light a soil,\r\nat the depth of 1 foot or even 2 feet, exposed to the influence of rain\r\nand frost, without their being returned to earth. Most probably there\r\nwas a ditch, and where there was a ditch there must have been a mound,\r\nand that, if heaped over the bodies, might have protected them. The\r\nvallum had disappeared in Aubrey's time; the ditch was filled up before\r\nStukeley's, and stones and all had been smoothed over in Sir R. Colt\r\nHoare's; so that now the site can hardly be defined with certainty. A\r\ntrench, however, cut across it, if it can be traced, might lead to some\r\ncurious revelations, for there can be no doubt whatever with regard\r\nto the facts stated in Dr. Toope's letter. He was a medical man of\r\neminence, and knew human bones perfectly, and was too deeply interested\r\nin the diggings, from which he drew \"his noble medicine,\" and to which\r\nhe frequently returned, to be mistaken in what he stated.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, what interests us more at this stage of the\r\nenquiry are the differences as well as the similarities of the two\r\nmonuments. The circles at Hakpen are on a very much smaller scale both\r\nas to linear dimensions and the size of the stones than the circles\r\nat Avebury; and the difference between burning and burying, which, so\r\nfar as the evidence goes, seems to have prevailed in the two places,\r\nis also remarkable. Do they belong to two different ages, and, if so,\r\nwhich is the elder? The evidence of the tumuli is uniform that the\r\ninhabitants of this island buried before they burnt. But can these\r\nbones be so old as this would force us to admit they were? So far as\r\nthe evidence at present goes, it seems impossible to carry the burials\r\non Hakpen Hill back to the earliest period of prehistoric interments;\r\nthe condition of the bones is sufficient to render such an hypothesis\r\nuntenable. Unless the phosphates and other component adjuncts remained\r\nin them, they would have been as useless for medicine as for manure,\r\nand the exposed position in which they lay would have reduced these to\r\ndust or mud in a very few centuries. From the descriptions we have, the\r\nbodies certainly were not in the contracted doubled-up position usual\r\nin the so-called bronze age, and there were no traces of the cremations\r\napparently introduced by the Romans, and practised for some time after\r\nthey left. All appear to have been laid out in the extended position\r\nafterwards adopted and continued to the present day. In fact everything\r\nwould lead us to suppose that Camden was not far wrong in saying that\r\nthese were the bones of the Saxons and Danes slain at the battle of\r\nKennet in A.D. 1006.[89] Even then, unless there was a mound\r\nover them, they could hardly have lasted 600 years in the state in\r\nwhich they were found. If we do not adopt this view, but insist that\r\nHakpen and Avebury are contemporary monuments, and part of one great\r\nplan, the only hypothesis that occurs to me that will at all account\r\nfor their peculiarities is that the victorious army burnt and buried\r\ntheir dead at Avebury, and that the defeated force got permission to\r\nbury their dead more modestly on Hakpen Hill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 17. Section of Silbury Hill.]\r\n\r\nSilbury Hill, which forms the third member of our group, is situated\r\nnearly due south from Avebury, at a distance of 1200 yards from the\r\noutside of the ring, of the former, to the foot of the hill, or, as\r\nnearly as may be, one Roman mile from centre to centre. Mr. Rickman[90]\r\nbased an argument on the latter fact, as if it proved the post-Roman\r\norigin of the group; and like the many recurring instances of 100 feet\r\nand 100 yards, which run through all the megalithic remains, it may\r\nhave some value, but, as a single instance, it can only be looked upon\r\nas a coincidence.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the hill, as ascertained by the Rev. Mr. Smith, of\r\nYatesbury,[91] are that it is 130 feet in height, 552 feet in diameter,\r\nand 1657 feet in circumference; that the flat top is 104 feet or 102\r\nfeet across,[92] according to the direction in which it is measured;\r\nthis last being another Roman coincidence, as the top has no doubt both\r\nsunk and spread. The angle of the slope of the sides is 30 degrees to\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1777 a shaft was sunk from the top of the mound to the\r\nbase, by order of the then Duke of Northumberland and Colonel Drax,\r\nbut no record has been preserved of what they found, or rather did\r\nnot find, for had they made any discovery of the least importance,\r\nit certainly would have been communicated to some of the learned\r\nsocieties of the day. Subsequently, in 1849, a shaft was driven nearly\r\nhorizontally from the southern face on the level of the original soil\r\nto the centre, where it met the Duke's shaft; and subsequently a\r\ncircular gallery was carried round the centre, but in vain; nothing was\r\nfound in these excavations that would show that the mound had ever been\r\nused for sepulchral purposes, or that threw any light whatever on its\r\nhistory or destination.[93]\r\n\r\nJudging from the analogies gathered from our knowledge of the parallel\r\nIndian series, we ought not to be surprised if this really were the\r\nonly result. From the accounts of the Chinese travellers who visited\r\nIndia in the fifth and seventh centuries, we learn that about one-half\r\nof the topes they saw and described were erected to commemorate\r\nevents, and not to contain relics, or as simulated tombs. Wherever\r\nBuddha or any of his followers performed any miracles, or where any\r\nevent happened of sufficient importance to make it desirable that the\r\nmemory of the locality where it happened should be preserved, there\r\na Tope was erected. To take an example as bearing more directly than\r\nusual on our present subject. When Dutthagamini, king of Ceylon (161\r\nB.C.), defeated the usurper Ellala, and restored the true\r\nfaith, \"he erected near the capital a dagoba in commemoration of his\r\nvictory. A stone pillar marks the spot where the action commenced,\r\nand another stone pillar exists there with an inscription to the\r\neffect that it marks the spot rendered sacred by the death and blood\r\nof Ellala.\"[94] The dagoba is a simple mound of earth, and, so far as\r\nknown, has never been opened. In Afghanistan, many of the topes opened\r\nby Messrs. Masson and Honigberger were found to be what they call\r\n\"blind topes,\" but they were not able to detect by any external sign\r\nwhether their researches were likely to be rewarded with success or to\r\nend in disappointment.[95]\r\n\r\nWhether these analogies are worth anything or not, nothing appears, at\r\nfirst sight at least, more probable than that, if the fallen chiefs\r\nof a victorious army are buried at Avebury, the survivors should\r\nhave employed their prisoners as slaves to erect a mound on the spot\r\nprobably where the chiefs were slain and the battle decided. The\r\ntradition, however, having been lost, the mound stands silent and\r\nuncommunicative, and it is not easy now to read its riddle.\r\n\r\nIt is very premature, however, to speculate either on these analogies\r\nor on the negative results of the explorations made into the hill:\r\nthese last were undertaken, like the diggings at Avebury, on the\r\nempirical assumption that the principal deposit would be found in the\r\ncentre, and at Silbury on the ground level, which is exactly the place\r\nwhere almost certainly it was not. Supposing that there is a low-level\r\nsepulture at Silbury, it probably will be found within 30 or 40 yards\r\nof the outer face of the mound, on the side looking towards Avebury,\r\nif it is connected with that monument. But the knowledge we have\r\nacquired, as will be afterwards detailed, from the examination of the\r\nMinning Lowe, Arbor Lowe, Rose Hill tumuli, and other monuments of this\r\nclass, would lead us to expect to find the principal deposit near the\r\nsummit. The bit of a bridle (woodcut No. 18) and the traces of armour\r\nwhich were found in Stukeley's time, near the summit, mark in all\r\nprobability the position of the principal graves, and nothing would\r\nsurprise me less than if five or six entombments were found arranged\r\naround the upper plateau at a small depth below the surface. We shall\r\nbe in a better position to judge how far this is probable when we have\r\nfinished this chapter; but till the evidence is adduced, it is useless\r\nto speculate on its effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18. Iron Bit of Bridle. Found in Silbury Hill.]\r\n\r\nAt one time I hoped that the Roman road might be found to have passed\r\nunder the hill, and if this were the case, it would settle the question\r\nas to whether it were pre- or post-Roman. In order to ascertain this,\r\nsome excavations were made into the hill in 1867, and simultaneously\r\non the high ground to the southward of it. As traces which seemed\r\nundoubtedly to mark the existence of the road running past the hill,\r\nat about 50 to 100 yards to the southward, were found there, the\r\nexcavations into the hill were discontinued, and the line of the road\r\nconsidered as established. Owing to various mishaps, no plan of these\r\ndiscoveries has yet been published, but the annexed woodcut, which is\r\ntraced from the Ordnance Survey sheet, will suffice to explain its\r\nbearing on the question.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 19. Plan of Avebury, from Ordnance Survey. The line of\r\nthe Roman road is hatched throughout.]\r\n\r\nStanding on Silbury Hill and looking westward, the road coming from\r\nBath over the downs seems to come direct at the hill. After passing the\r\nDevizes road, it trends to the southward, and shortly again resumes\r\nits original direction. About a mile before it reaches the hill, it\r\nagain resumes its southward direction, and passes it at a distance\r\nof between 50 to 100 yards, making, apparently, for the spot where\r\nthe bridge over the Kennet now exists, and may have existed in Roman\r\ntimes. Those who contend for the pre-Roman antiquity of the hill rest\r\ntheir case on the assumption that the Romans always made or wished to\r\nmake their roads perfectly straight, and that this being deflected to\r\nthe south, it was in consequence of the hill being there at the time\r\nthe road was made. This, however, is singularly contradicted by the\r\nline of this very road westwards from the Devizes road. According to\r\nthe Ordnance Survey, it is set out in a curve for 3½ miles till it\r\nmeets the Wandsdyke. Why this was done is not clearer than why the road\r\nshould have been curved to the eastward of the Devizes road. But, on\r\nthe other hand, supposing the hill to have been where it now stands,\r\nand the Romans wished the road to be straight, nothing in the world was\r\nso easy as for them to set out a line mathematically straight between\r\nthe Devizes road and the point where it passes the hill. The country\r\nis and was perfectly open, and quite as flat as any Roman road-maker\r\ncould desire, and signals could have been seen throughout with perfect\r\nfacility. It is crediting the Roman surveyors with a degree of\r\nstupidity they certainly did not show elsewhere, to say, if they wanted\r\na straight road, that seeing the hill before their eyes, they first\r\nset out their road towards it, when they knew that before they had\r\nadvanced a mile, they must bend it so as to avoid that very obstacle.\r\nEven then they would have tried to make it as straight as possible,\r\nand would have adopted the line of the present coach-road, which runs\r\ninside their line and between it and the hill. At the same time, if\r\nany one will turn to Sir R. Colt Hoare's map of the Roman roads in\r\nthis district--\"Stations Calne and Swindon\"--which includes Avebury,\r\nhe will find that all are set out in lines more or less curvilinear,\r\nand sometimes violently so, when any object was to be gained by so\r\ndoing. Though, therefore, as a general rule, it is safe to argue on the\r\npresumption of the straightness of Roman roads, it may lead to serious\r\nerror to rely on such evidence in every instance.\r\n\r\nThe inference drawn from the piece of the Roman road further eastward\r\non Hakpen Hill is the same. It is perfectly distinct and quite straight\r\nfor about a mile, but if it had been continued in that line, it would\r\nhave passed the hill at a distance of at least 200 yards to the\r\nsouthward, and never have joined the other piece till long after it\r\nhad passed the Devizes road. It was deflected northward in the village\r\nof Kennet, apparently to reach the bridge, and then to join the piece\r\ncoming from Bath.\r\n\r\nThe result of all this seems to be, that the evidence of the Roman\r\nroad is inconclusive either way and must be withdrawn. Taking the\r\npoint where it passes the Devizes road, and the piece which is found\r\non Hakpen hill as fixed points, to join these it must have passed\r\nconsiderably to the southward of the hill; whether it did so in a\r\nmathematically straight line or in one slightly curved, was a matter\r\nfor the judgment of the surveyor; but till we know his motives, it is\r\nnot in our power to found any argument upon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 20. Elevation of the Bartlow Hills. From the\r\n'Archæologia,' xxx.]\r\n\r\nIf, however, the Roman road refuses to give evidence in this cause,\r\nthe form of the hill offers some indications which are of value. As\r\nbefore mentioned, it is a truncated straight-lined cone, sloping at an\r\nangle of 30° to the horizon, while all the British barrows known are\r\ndomical or, at least, curvilinear in section. In all his experience,\r\nSir R. Colt Hoare met with only one straight-lined monument of this\r\nclass, which consequently he calls the Conical Barrow. Whether it\r\nwas truncated or not is not quite clear. There are bushes, or weeds,\r\ngrowing out of the top, which conceal its form.[96] Nothing was found\r\nin the barrow to indicate its age except a brass (bronze?) spear-head,\r\nbut it was attached to a British village, apparently of the Roman\r\nperiod, inasmuch as iron nails and Roman pottery were found in it.[97]\r\nBe this as it may, there are a range of tumuli at Bartlow, on the\r\nboundary between Essex and Cambridgeshire, which are all truncated\r\ncones, and are undoubtedly of Roman origin. A coin of Hadrian was\r\nfound in the chamber of one of them, and Mr. Gage, and the other\r\narchæologists who were present at the opening, were all agreed that all\r\nthe four opened were of about the same age.[98] We may therefore feel\r\nassured that they were not earlier than the time of Hadrian, though\r\nfrom the style of workmanship of the various articles found, I would\r\nfeel inclined to consider them somewhat more modern, but that is of\r\nlittle consequence. The point that interests us most is, that the angle\r\nof the Conical Barrow quoted above is 45° to the horizon, that of the\r\nprincipal tumuli at Bartlow 37½° and that of Silbury Hill 30°. Here\r\nwe certainly have a sequence not long enough to be quite satisfactory,\r\nbut still of considerable value, as an indication that Silbury hill was\r\npost-Roman.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have undoubted evidence that the truncated\r\nconical form was common in post-Roman times. We have one, for instance,\r\nat Marlborough, close by, and if that place was Merlin's bury, as Sir\r\nR. Colt Hoare would fain persuade us it was, it assists us considerably\r\nin our argument. Without insisting on this, however, Mr. George Clark,\r\nin his most valuable paper on Ancient English Castles,[99] enumerates\r\nninety truncated cones erected in England, he considers, between the\r\nRoman times and the Norman conquest. \"These earthworks,\" he says,\r\n\"may be thus described: First was cast up a truncated cone of earth,\r\nstanding at its natural slope from 50 feet to 100 feet in diameter at\r\nthe top, and from 20 feet to 50 feet high.\"[100] Mr. Clark does not\r\nbelieve that these were ever sepulchral, nor does it occur to him that\r\nthey might be memorial. I should, however, be disinclined to accept\r\nthe first conclusion as absolute till excavations had been made into\r\nsome of them, at least, where I fancy we may find indications rather\r\ntending the other way. Whether they were memorial or not must depend\r\non traditions that have not hitherto been looked for. Mr. Clark's\r\ncontention was that all had at some time or other been used for\r\nresidential purposes, and as fortifications, and many are recorded as\r\nhaving been erected as castles. All this is probably quite correct, but\r\nthe point that interests us here is, that there are nearly one hundred\r\nexamples of truncated cones of earth thrown up in England after the\r\nRoman times, and not one before. If this is so, the conclusion seems\r\ninevitable that Silbury Hill must belong to the latter age. Whether\r\nthis conclusion can be sustained or not, must depend on what follows\r\nfrom the other monuments we are about to examine. The evidence of the\r\nmonument itself, which is all we have hitherto had an opportunity of\r\nbringing forward, may be sufficient to render it probable, but not to\r\nprove the case. Unless other examples can be adduced whose evidence\r\ntends the same way, the case cannot be taken as proved, however strong\r\na _prima facie_ presumption may be established.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 21. Marden Circle. From Sir R. C. Hoare. No Scale.]\r\n\r\nThough a little distant, it may be convenient to include the Marden\r\ncircle in the Avebury group. It is situated in a village of that name\r\nseven miles south of Silbury Hill. When Sir R. Colt Hoare surveyed it\r\nfifty years ago, the southern half of the vallum had been so completely\r\ndestroyed, that it could not be traced, and he carried it across the\r\nbrook, making the whole area about fifty-one acres.[101] My impression\r\nis that this is a mistake, and that the area of the circle was only\r\nabout half that extent. The rampart was of about the same section as\r\nAvebury, and the ditch was inside as there. Within this enclosure were\r\ntwo mounds, situated unsymmetrically, like the circles at Avebury. The\r\ngreater one was opened with great difficulty, owing to the friable\r\nnature of the earth of which it was composed; and Mr. Cunnington was\r\nconvinced that it was sepulchral, and contained one or more burials\r\nby cremation; but Sir R. Colt Hoare was so imbued with the Druidical\r\ntheory as to Avebury, that he could not give up the idea that so\r\nsimilar a monument must be also a Druidical altar, and the whole a\r\ntemple. The second barrow was too much ruined to yield any results, and\r\non revisiting the spot, it was found to have been cleared away. A great\r\npart of the vallum had also been removed, but in it was found at least\r\none skeleton of a man who had been buried there.[102] How many more\r\nthere may have been it is impossible to say. The destroyers of these\r\nantiquities were not likely to boast of the number of bodies they had\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe great interest of this circle is that it contains in earth the\r\ncounterpart of what was found at Avebury in stone; not that this\r\nnecessarily betokens either an earlier or a later age. There are no\r\nstones to be found at Marden, which is on the edge of the chalk, while\r\nthe country about Avebury was and is covered with Sarsens to this\r\nday. It may, however, be considered as very positive evidence of the\r\nsepulchral nature of that monument, if such were needed, and if it\r\nwere thoroughly explored, might perhaps settle the question of the age\r\nof both. In this respect, the Marden monument affords a better field\r\nfor the explorer than Avebury. The destruction or disfigurement of its\r\nmound, or vallum, would be no great loss to antiquaries, if a proper\r\nrecord were kept of their present appearance; while to do anything\r\ntending towards the further dilapidation of Avebury is a sacrilege from\r\nwhich every one would shrink.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the neighbourhood it now only remains to try and\r\ndetermine who the brave men were who were buried at Avebury, and who\r\nthe victors who raised the mound at Silbury, assuming that the one is\r\na burying place, and the other a trophy. Some years ago I suggested\r\nit was those who fell in Arthur's last and greatest battle of Badon\r\nHill, fought somewhere in this neighbourhood in the year A.D.\r\n520,[103] and nothing that has since occurred has at all shaken my\r\nconviction in the correctness of this determination,[104] but a good\r\ndeal has tended to confirm it.\r\n\r\nThe authors of the 'Monumenta Britannica' fix the site of this battle\r\nat Banesdown, near Bath, which is the generally received opinion.[105]\r\nCarte, and others, have suggested Baydon Hill, about thirteen miles\r\nwest by north from Avebury, while Dr. Guest carries it off to Badbury,\r\nin Dorset,[106] a distance of forty miles. Unfortunately, Gildas, who\r\nis our principal authority on this matter, only gives us in three\r\nwords all he has to say of the locality in which it was fought--\"Prope\r\nSabrinum Ostium\";[107] and it has been asserted that these words are\r\nan interpolation, because they are not found in all the ancient MSS.\r\nIf they are, however, an insertion, they are still of very ancient\r\ndate, and would not have been admitted and repeated if they had not\r\nbeen added by some one who knew or had authority for introducing them.\r\nAs the words are generally translated, they are taken to mean near the\r\nmouth of the Severn, a construction at once fatal to the pretensions\r\nof Bath, which it is impossible any one should describe as near that\r\nriver, even if any one could say where the mouth of that river is. It\r\nis most difficult to determine where the river ends and the estuary\r\nbegins, and to a mediæval geographer, especially, that point must\r\nhave been much nearer Gloucester than even Bristol. This, however,\r\nis of little consequence, as the words in the text are not \"Sabrinæ\r\nostium,\" but \"Sabrinum ostium\"; and as the river is always spoken of\r\nas feminine, it is not referred to here, and the expression can only\r\nbe translated as \"near the Welsh gate.\" Nor does it seem difficult to\r\ndetermine where the Welsh gate must have been.\r\n\r\nThe Wandsdyke always seems to have been regarded as a barrier erected\r\nto stop the incursions of the Welsh into the southern counties, and\r\nthat part of it extending from Savernake forest westward, for ten or\r\ntwelve miles, seems at some comparatively recent period to have been\r\nraised and strengthened[108] (either by the Belgæ or Saxons) to make\r\nit more effectual for that purpose. According as an army is advancing\r\nnorthward from Winchester, or Chichester to the Severn valley, or is\r\nmarching from Gloucester or Cirencester towards the south, the rampart\r\neither protects or bars the way. In its centre, near the head-waters\r\nof the Kennet, the Saxons advanced in 557 to the siege of Barbury\r\nCastle, and having gained that vantage ground, they again advanced in\r\n577 to Deorham, and fought the battle that gave them possession of\r\nGlewanceaster, Cyrenceaster, and Bathanceaster.[109] What they then\r\naccomplished they seem to have attempted unsuccessfully thirty-seven\r\nyears earlier, and to have been stopped in the attempt by Arthur\r\nat Badon Hill. If this is so, there can be very little difficulty\r\nin determining the site of the Welsh gate as that opening through\r\nwhich the road now passes 2½ miles south of Silbury Hill, in the\r\nvery centre of the strengthened part of the Wandsdyke. If this is\r\nso, the Saxons under Cerdic must have passed through the village of\r\nAvebury, supposing it then existed, on their way to Cirencester; and\r\nif we assume that they were attacked on Waden hill by Arthur, the\r\nwhole history of the campaign is clear. If we may rely on a nominal\r\nsimilarity the case may be considered as proved. Waden is the name by\r\nwhich the hill between Avebury and Silbury is called at the present\r\nday by the people of the country, and it is so called on the Ordnance\r\nsurvey sheets, and etymologically Waden is more like Badon than Baydon,\r\nor Badbury, or any other name in the neighbourhood. The objection\r\nto this is that Waden Hill is not fortified, and that Gildas speaks\r\nof the \"Obsessio Montis Badonici.\" It is true there is no trace of\r\nany earthworks on it now, but in Stukeley's time there were tumuli\r\nand earthen rings (apparently sepulchral) on its summit, which are\r\nrepresented in his plates; but no trace of these now remains. The hill\r\nwas cultivated in his day, and in a century or so beyond his time all\r\ntraces of ramparts may have been obliterated, supposing them to have\r\nexisted. The true explanation of the difficulty, however, I believe to\r\nbe found in Jeffrey of Monmouth's account of these transactions. He\r\nis a frail reed to rely upon; but occasionally he seems to have had\r\naccess to authorities now lost, and their testimony at times throws\r\nconsiderable light on passages of our history otherwise obscure.\r\nAccording to him there was both a siege and a battle; and his account\r\nof the battle is so circumstantial and so probable, that it is\r\ndifficult to believe it to be a pure invention. If it is not, every\r\ndetail of his description would answer perfectly to an attack on an\r\narmy posted on Waden Hill.[110] The siege would then probably be that\r\nof Barbury Hill, which Cerdic would be obliged to raise on Arthur's\r\nadvance; and retreating towards the shelter of the Wandsdyke, he was\r\novertaken at this spot and defeated, and so peace was established for\r\nmany years between the Brits and the Saxons. It may be true that the\r\nwritten evidence is not either sufficiently detailed or sufficiently\r\nprecise to establish the fact that the battle was fought on this spot.\r\nIt must, however, be conceded that nothing in all that is written\r\ncontradicts what is here advanced, and when to this we add such a\r\nburying place, Avebury at one end of Waden Hill, and such a monument\r\nas Silbury Hill at the other, the proofs that it was so seem to me to\r\namount as nearly to certainty as we can now expect to arrive at in such\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nThose who believe, however, that all these monuments are absolutely\r\nprehistoric, will not, of course, be convinced by any argument derived\r\nfrom a single monument; but if it should turn out that even a more\r\ncertain case can be made out for the equally modern age of others, that\r\npoint must eventually be conceded. When it is, I feel no doubt that it\r\nwill come eventually to be acknowledged that those who fell in Arthur's\r\ntwelfth and greatest battle were buried in the ring at Avebury, and\r\nthat those who survived raised these stones and the mound at Silbury\r\nin the vain hope that they would convey to their latest posterity the\r\nmemory of their prowess.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONEHENGE.\r\n\r\nAlthough from its exceptional character Stonehenge is not so valuable\r\nas some others for evidence of the age or uses of the rest of the\r\nmonuments of this class, it is in some respects even more important\r\nfor our argument, inasmuch as it possesses a more complete mediæval\r\nhistory than almost any other of the series. It must be confessed that\r\nthis history is neither so clear nor so complete as might be wished;\r\nbut, with the other evidence that can be adduced, it makes up a case so\r\nstrong as to leave little to be desired. Before, however, proceeding to\r\nthis, it is necessary to ascertain what Stonehenge really is, or rather\r\nwas, for strange to say, though numberless restorations of it have\r\nbeen published, not one is quite satisfactory. There is very little\r\ndiscrepancy of opinion with regard to the outer circle or the five\r\ngreat central trilithons, but there is the greatest possible variety of\r\nopinion as to the number and position of the smaller stones inside the\r\ncentral or between the two great circles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 22. General Plan of Stonehenge. From 'Knight's Old\r\nEngland.']\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no doubt that the outer stone circle originally\r\nconsisted of thirty square piers, spaced tolerably equally in the\r\ncircle. Though only twenty-six can now be identified, either standing\r\nor lying in fragments on the ground, it seems equally certain that\r\nthey were all connected by a continuous stone impost or architrave,\r\nthough only six of these are now in _situ_.[111] The diameter of the\r\ncircle is generally stated to be about 100 feet, and as this has been\r\nsuggested as a reason for its being considered as post-Roman, it is\r\nimportant to know what its exact dimensions are. It turns out that\r\nfrom the face of one pier to that of the opposite one, where both are\r\nperpendicular, the distance is 97·6, or exactly 100 Roman feet. The\r\ndistance from the outer face of these piers to inside of the earthen\r\nvallum that surrounds the whole is again 100 feet, though that cannot\r\nnow be ascertained within a foot or two, or even more; but as this\r\nmakes up the 100 yards and the 100 feet which recur so often in these\r\nmonuments, these dimensions can hardly be considered accidental, and\r\n\"valeant quantum\" are an indication of their post-Roman date.[112]\r\n\r\nInside these outer circles stand the five great trilithons. Since the\r\npublication of Sir R. Colt Hoare's plan, their position and plan may\r\nbe considered as settled. According to him, the height of the outer\r\npair is 16·3, of the intermediate pair 17·2, and of the great central\r\ntrilithon as it now stands 21·6. In their simple grandeur they are\r\nperhaps the most effective example of megalithic art that ever was\r\nexecuted by man. The Egyptians and Romans raised larger stones, but\r\nthey destroyed their grandeur by ornament, or by their accompaniments;\r\nbut these simple square masses on Salisbury plain are still unrivalled\r\nfor magnificence in their own peculiar style.\r\n\r\nAll the stones in these two great groups are Sarsens, as they are\r\nlocally called, a peculiar class of silicious sandstone that is found\r\nas a local deposit in the bottoms of the valleys between Salisbury and\r\nSwindon. It is the same stone as is used at Avebury, the difference\r\nbeing that there the stones are used rough in their natural state,\r\nhere they are hewn and fitted with very considerable nicety. Each of\r\nthe uprights has a tenon on its surface, and the undersides of the\r\narchitrave, or horizontal piece, have each a mortice, or rather two\r\nmortices, into which these tenons fit with considerable exactness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 23. Stonehenge as at present existing, from Mr.\r\nHawkshaw's plan.]\r\n\r\nBesides these there are even now eleven stones, some standing, others\r\nthrown down, but still existing, within the inner circle. These are\r\nof a different nature, being all cut from igneous rocks, such as are\r\nnot to be found nearer than Cornwall or even Ireland. It has not been\r\nexactly ascertained whence they came; indeed, they seem to be of\r\nvarious kinds, and consequently must have been brought from different\r\nplaces. Locally they are called Blue stones, and it may be well to\r\nadopt that short title for the present, as involving no theory, and as\r\nsufficing to distinguish them from the local Sarsens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 24. Plan of Stonehenge restored.]\r\n\r\nNone of the blue stones are large; one of the finest (23 in Sir R. Colt\r\nHoare's plan) is 7 feet 6 inches high, 2 feet 3 inches wide at base,\r\ntapering to 1 foot on top. The others are generally smaller. One blue\r\nstone opposite 23 is grooved with a channel from top to bottom, though\r\nfor what purpose it is not easy to guess. On the most cursory glance,\r\nit is evident that these stones generally stood in pairs, about 3 feet\r\napart; but some are so completely overthrown and displaced, that it\r\nis not quite clear whether this can be predicated of all. Entering\r\nthe choir on the left hand we find one that seems to stand alone. But\r\nwe may infer that this was not always so, from the circumstance that\r\nthere lies close by it an impost stone with two mortice holes in it,\r\nonly 3 feet 6 inches apart, which must have belonged to a smaller order\r\nof trilithons, and is just such as would fit a pair of blue stones.\r\nThe next pair on the left is very distinct, and stands between the two\r\ngreat trilithons. The next pair is also similarly situated. On the\r\nopposite side there are two pairs, but situated, as far as can be made\r\nout, in front of, and not between the trilithons; and again, there\r\nare two blue stones behind the stone called the Altar stone, but so\r\ndisplaced by the fall of the great trilithon behind them, that it is\r\nimpossible to make out their original position with certainty.\r\n\r\nIt will probably be impossible to determine whether all the pairs of\r\nthe stones were miniature trilithons or not, till we are able to turn\r\nover all the stones that now strew the ground, and see if there is a\r\nsecond stone with two mortices 3 or 4 feet apart. In the meanwhile\r\nthere is a passage in Henry of Huntingdon's work which may throw some\r\nlight on the subject. He describes \"Lapides miræ magnitudinis in modum\r\nportarum elevati sunt, ita ut portæ portis superpositæ videantur.\"[113]\r\nWith a very little latitude of translation, this might be taken as\r\nreferring to the great trilithons towering over the smaller; but\r\nif we are to adhere to the literal meaning of the words, this is\r\ninadmissible. Another explanation has therefore been suggested. The\r\nimpost stone of the great trilithon has apparently mortice holes on\r\nboth sides. If those on one side are not mere wearings of the weather,\r\nthis must indicate that something stood upon it. If we assume two\r\ncubical blocks, and raise on them the stone now called the Altar stone,\r\nwhich is of the exact dimensions required, we would have an arrangement\r\nvery similar to that of the Sanchi gateway,[114] a cast of which is\r\nnow exhibiting at South Kensington, and which would fully justify\r\nHuntingdon's words. If it is objected that it is a long way to go to\r\nSanchi to look for a type, it may be answered that the Imperial coins\r\nof Cyprus show a very similar construction, and both may be derived\r\nfrom a common centre. On the whole, however, I am inclined to the first\r\nexplanation. There certainly were large and small trilithons, and too\r\ngreat accuracy of description is not to be expected from a Latin writer\r\nin the middle ages.\r\n\r\nA good deal of astonishment has been expressed at the labour it must\r\nhave required to transport these blue stones from Cornwall or Wales\r\nand to set them up here. If we refer them to the pre-Roman times of\r\nour naked blue painted ancestors, the difficulties are, of course,\r\nconsiderable. But after Roman times, the class of vessels they were in\r\nthe habit of building in these islands must have made their transport\r\nby sea easy, even if they came from Ireland, as I believe they did. And\r\nany one who has seen with what facility Chinese coolies carry about\r\nmonolithic pillars 10 feet and 12 feet long, and thick in proportion,\r\nwill not wonder that twenty or thirty men should transport these from\r\nthe head of Southampton water to Stonehenge.[115] With the works the\r\nRomans left, and the modicum of civilization the natives could not fail\r\nto have imbibed from them, the whole was simple, and must have been\r\neasy.\r\n\r\nStill more wonder has been expressed at the mass of the stones\r\ncomposing the great trilithons themselves, and speculations have been\r\nrife as to how our forefathers could, without machinery, drag these\r\nmasses to the spot, and erect them as they now stand. A good deal of\r\nthis wonder has been removed, since it was understood that the Sarsens\r\nof which they are composed are a natural deposit, found on the surface\r\non all the bottoms in the Wiltshire downs. Owing to the progress of\r\ncivilization, they have disappeared about Salisbury, but they are still\r\nto be seen in hundreds in Clatford bottom, and all about Avebury, and\r\nin the northern portion of the downs. The distance, therefore, that\r\nthe stones of Stonehenge had to be dragged was probably very small;\r\nand over a hard, even surface of chalk down, with a few rollers and\r\nropes, must have been a task of no great difficulty. Nor would the\r\nprocess of blocking them up with a temporary mound composed of wood\r\nand chalk be one that would frighten a rude people with whom time was\r\nno object. After all, Stonehenge is only child's play as compared\r\nwith the monolithic masses the Egyptians quarried, and carved, and\r\nmoved all over their country, long before Stonehenge was thought of,\r\nand without machinery in the sense in which we understand the term.\r\nIn India, our grandfathers might have seen far more wonderful things\r\ndone before we crushed all feeling and enterprise out of the people.\r\nThe great gateway, for instance, at Seringham is 40 feet high, 21 feet\r\nwide, and 100 feet deep. The four door posts are each of a single block\r\nof granite, more, consequently, than 40 feet in length, for they are\r\npartially buried in the earth. The whole is roofed by slabs of granite,\r\neach more than 21 feet long, and raised to the height of 40 feet;\r\nand all of these, though of granite, are elaborately carved. Yet the\r\nbuilding of the gateway was stopped by our quarrel with the French for\r\nthe possession of Trichinopoly in the middle of the last century. The\r\nIndians in those days had no machinery, but with plenty of hands and\r\nplenty of leisure mountains may be raised; and it is on this principle\r\nthat barbarous nations act and by which they achieve such wonders. The\r\nmasses of Stonehenge are not, however, so very great after all, but\r\nthey impose by their simplicity. To use an apparent paradox, it is one\r\nof the most artistic buildings in the world from its very want of art.\r\nThe 40 feet monoliths of Seringham do not impress as much as the 20\r\nfeet stones of Stonehenge, because the one is covered with sculpture,\r\nthe other more nearly in a state of nature, and the effect on the mind\r\nis immensely enhanced by the monolithic simplicity of the whole.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, this very grandeur and apparent difficulty is one of\r\nthe most common reasons adduced for its pre-Roman antiquity. Few can\r\nescape from an ill-defined impression that what is great and difficult\r\nmust also be ancient, though the probability is, that if the feeling\r\nwere analyzed it would be found to have arisen from the learning we\r\nimbibed in the nursery, and which told us of the giants that lived in\r\nthe olden time. If, however, we turn from the teachings of nursery\r\nrhymes to the pages of sober history, what we learn is something very\r\ndifferent. Without laying too much stress on the nakedness and blue\r\npaint of our ancestors, all history, and the testimony of the barrows,\r\nwould lead us to suppose that the inhabitants of this island, before\r\nthe Romans occupied it, were sparse, poor in _physique_, and in a very\r\nlow state of civilization. Though their national spirit may have been\r\nknocked out of them, they must have increased in number, in physical\r\ncomfort, and in civilization during the four centuries of peaceful\r\nprosperity of the Roman domination, and therefore in so far as that\r\nargument goes, became infinitely more capable of erecting such a\r\nmonument as Stonehenge after the departure of the Romans than they had\r\nbeen before their advent.\r\n\r\nIt certainly appears one of the strangest inversions of logic to assume\r\nthat the same people erected Stonehenge who, during the hundreds, or\r\nit may be the thousands, of years of their occupation, could attempt\r\nnothing greater than the wretched mole-hills of barrows which they\r\nscraped up all over the Wiltshire downs. Not one of those has even a\r\ncircle of stone round its base; nowhere is there a battle stone or a\r\nstone monument of any sort. Though the downs must have been covered\r\nwith Sarsens, they had neither sense nor enterprise sufficient even to\r\nset one of those stones on end. Yet we are asked to believe that the\r\nsame people, in the same state, erected Stonehenge and Avebury, and\r\nheaped up Silbury Hill. These monuments may be the expression of the\r\nfeelings of the same race; but if I am not very much mistaken, in a\r\nvery different and much more advanced state of civilization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall be in a better position to answer a question which has\r\nfrequently been raised, whether or not the blue stones were a part\r\nof the original structure, or were added afterwards, when we have\r\ndiscussed the materials for the history of its erection; meanwhile\r\nwe may pass from these, which are the really interesting part of the\r\nstructure, to the circle which is generally supposed to have existed\r\nbetween the outer circle of Sarsens and the inner choir of great stones.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this nothing is certain, except in respect to eight\r\nstones, which stretched across the entrance of the choir, and may\r\nconsequently be called the choir screen. Of the four on the right hand\r\nside only one has fallen, but it is still there; on the left hand only\r\ntwo remain, and only one is standing, but the design is perfectly\r\nclear. The two central stones are 6 feet high, and the stones fall off\r\nby regular gradation right and left to 3 feet at the extremities. They\r\nare rude unhewn Sarsen stones, but there is nothing to indicate whether\r\nthey were, or were not, a part of the original design.\r\n\r\nBeyond this, between the two great Sarsen circles, there exist some\r\nnine or ten stones, but whether they are in _situ_ or not, or whether\r\nthey were ever more numerous, it seems impossible to determine. On\r\nthe left hand, near the centre, are a pair that may have been a\r\ntrilithon, but the rest are scattered so unsymmetrically that it\r\nwould be dangerous to hazard any conjecture with regard to their\r\noriginal arrangement. It seems, however, most improbable that while\r\nthe choir screen is so nearly entire even now, that this circle, if it\r\never existed, should have been so completely destroyed. Had it been\r\ncomplete, it would probably have consisted of 40 stones (excluding, of\r\ncourse, the choir screen), and of these only 10, if so many, can be\r\nsaid to belong to it. These are rude unhewn stones, and of no great\r\ndimensions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, there are two stones now overthrown lying inside\r\nthe vallum, unsymmetrically with one another, or with anything else.\r\nHere again the question arises, were there more? There is nothing on\r\nthe spot to guide us to our answer, and as nothing hinges upon it, I\r\nmay perhaps be allowed to suggest that each of these marks a secondary\r\ninterment. At the foot of each, I fancy urns or bones, or some evidence\r\nof a burial might be found, and if the place had continued for a\r\ncentury as a burying place, it might have been surrounded by its circle\r\nof stones, like Avebury, or Crichie, or Stanton moor. The place,\r\nhowever, may have become deserted shortly after these two were erected,\r\nand none have been added since.\r\n\r\nThere are still two other stones, one standing, one lying in the short\r\navenue that leads up to the temple. Their position is exactly that\r\nof the two stones, which are all that is visible of the so-called\r\nBeckhampton avenue, at Avebury. But what their use is it is difficult\r\nto guess. Were either of the places temples, they would have been\r\nplaced opposite one another on each side of the avenue, so that the\r\npriests in procession and people might pass between, but being placed\r\none behind the other in the centre of the roadway, they must have had\r\nsome other meaning. What that may have been I am unable to suggest. The\r\nspade may tell us if judiciously applied, but except from the spade I\r\ndo not know where to look for a solution of the riddle.\r\n\r\nThose who consider that Stonehenge was a temple have certainly much\r\nbetter grounds for such a theory than it would be possible to establish\r\nin respect to Avebury. Indeed, looking at the ground plan above, there\r\nis something singularly templar in its arrangement. In the centre is\r\na choir, in which a dignified service could be performed, and a stone\r\nlies now just in such a position as to entitle it to the appellation it\r\ngenerally receives of the altar stone. Unfortunately for this theory,\r\nhowever, it lies flush with the ground, and even if we assume that\r\nthe surface has been raised round it, its thickness is not sufficient\r\nto entitle it to be so called, judging from any analogous example we\r\nknow of elsewhere. Around the choir is what may fairly be considered\r\nthe procession path; and if its walls had only been solid, and there\r\nwere any indications that the building had ever been roofed, it would\r\nbe difficult to prove that it was not erected as a temple, and for\r\nworship. As, however, it has no walls, and it is impossible to believe\r\nthat it was ever intended to be roofed, all the arguments that apply to\r\nAvebury in this respect are equally applicable here, with this one in\r\naddition. Unless its builders were much more pachydermatous, or woolly,\r\nthan their degenerate descendants, when they chose this very drafty and\r\nhypæthral style of architecture, they would certainly have selected a\r\nsheltered spot on the banks of the Avon close by, where, with trees\r\nand other devices, they might have provided some shelter from the\r\ninclemency of the weather. They never would have erected their temples\r\non the highest and most exposed part of an open chalk down, where no\r\nshelter was possible, and no service could be performed except at\r\nirregular intervals, dependent on the weather throughout the year. As,\r\nhowever, it differs not only in plan but in construction--being hewn\r\nand having imposts--from all the rude stone circles we are acquainted\r\nwith elsewhere, no theory will be quite satisfactory that does not\r\naccount for this difference. My belief is, that this difference arises\r\nfrom the fact that alone of all the monuments we know of its class,\r\nit was erected leisurely and in time of peace by a prince retaining a\r\nconsiderable admixture of Roman blood in his veins. All, or most of the\r\nothers, seem to be records of battles erected in haste by soldiers and\r\nunskilled workmen: but of this hereafter.\r\n\r\nOwing to its exceptional character, the usual analogies apply less\r\ndirectly to Stonehenge than to almost any other monument.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 25. Tomb of Isidorus, at Khatoura.]\r\n\r\nWe shall be better able to judge how far those derived from India\r\napply, when we have described the monuments of that country. In Europe\r\nthe trilithon is certainly exceptional, and its origin not easily\r\ntraced. My own impression is, that it is only an improved dolmen,\r\nstanding on two legs instead of three, or four; but if that is so,\r\nthe intermediate steps are wanting which would enable us to connect\r\nthe two in a logical manner. They were not, however, quite unknown in\r\nthe Roman world. Several exist in Syria, for instance; three of these\r\nare engraved in De Vogüé's work. One (the tomb of Emilius Reginus,\r\nA.D. 195) consists of two Doric columns, with an impost;\r\nanother (woodcut No. 25) is the tomb of a certain Isidorus, and is\r\ndated A.D. 222, and is more like our Salisbury example; both\r\nthese last-named are situated near Khatoura.[116] The bearing of such\r\nan example as this on the question of the age of these monuments admits\r\nof a double interpretation. According to the usual and specious mode of\r\nreasoning, the ruder form must be the earliest, and the architectural\r\none copied from it. But this theory I believe to be entirely at\r\nvariance with the facts, as observed. The rudeness or elaboration of a\r\nmonument will probably be found in all instances to be an index of the\r\ngreater or less civilization of the people who erected it, but seldom\r\nor ever a trustworthy index of time. What interests us more at present\r\nis the knowledge that these Syrian examples are certainly sepulchral,\r\nand their form is thus another argument in favour of the sepulchral\r\ncharacter of Stonehenge, if any were needed. More satisfactory than\r\nthis, however, is the testimony of Olaus Magnus, archbishop of Upsala,\r\nquoted above.[117] He describes and figures \"the most honourable\r\nmonuments of the great of his country as erected with immense stones,\r\nand formed like great gates or trilithons\" (in modum altissimæ et\r\nlatissimæ januæ sursum transversumque viribus gigantum erecta). There\r\nis no reason for supposing that this author ever saw or even heard of\r\nStonehenge, yet it would be difficult to describe either the purpose or\r\nthe mode of construction of that monument more correctly than he does;\r\nand in so far as such testimony is considered valuable, it is decisive\r\nas to both the age and use of the monument.\r\n\r\nPassing on from this branch of the enquiry to such local indications\r\nas the spot affords, we find nothing very relevant or very important\r\neither for or against our hypothesis. It has been argued, for instance,\r\nthat the number of tumuli that stud the downs within a few miles of\r\nStonehenge, is a proof that this temple stood there before the barrows\r\nwere erected, and that they gathered round its sacred precincts. The\r\nfirst objection to this view is, that it is applying a Christian\r\nprecedent to a Pagan people. Except the Jews, who seem to have buried\r\ntheir kings close to their temples,[118] I do not know of any people in\r\nancient or modern times except Christians who did so, and we certainly\r\nhave no hint that the ancient Britons were an exception to this\r\nuniversal rule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 26. Country around Stonehenge. From Ordnance Survey\r\nmaps. Scale 1 inch to 1 mile.]\r\n\r\nAssuming, however, for the sake of argument, that this were otherwise,\r\nwe should then certainly find the barrows arranged with some reference\r\nto Stonehenge. Either they would have gathered closely around its\r\nprecincts, or ranged in rows alongside the roads or avenues leading\r\nto it. Nothing of the sort, however, occurs, as will be seen from the\r\nwoodcut in the following page. Within 700 yards of the monument there\r\nis only one very insignificant group, eight in number (15 to 23 of Sir\r\nR. Colt Hoare's plan). Beyond that they become frequent, crowning the\r\ntops of the hills, or clustering in the hollows, but nowhere with the\r\nleast apparent reference to Stonehenge. If any one will take the\r\nOrdnance Survey maps, or Sir R. Colt Hoare's plans, he will find the\r\nbarrows pretty evenly sown all over the surface of the plain, from\r\ntwo or three miles south of Stonehenge as far as Chidbury camp, eight\r\nmiles north of it. Indeed, if Sir R. Colt Hoare's plans are to be\r\ntrusted, they were thicker at the northern end of the plain than at\r\nthe southern;[119] but as the Ordnance maps do not bear this out, it\r\nmust not be relied upon. Nowhere over this large area (say 10 miles by\r\n5 miles) is there any trace of system as to the mode of placing these\r\nbarrows. Indeed, from Dorchester up to Swindon, over a distance of more\r\nthan seventy miles, they are scattered either singly or in groups so\r\ncompletely without order, that the only feasible explanation seems to\r\nbe, that each man was buried where he lived; it may possibly have been\r\nin his own garden, but more probably in his own house. The hut circles\r\nof British villages are in grouping and in form so like the barrows,\r\nthat it is difficult not to suspect some connexion between them. It may\r\nhave been that when the head of a family died, he was buried on his own\r\nhearth, and an earthen mound replaced the hut in which he lived. Be\r\nthis as it may, there is one argument that those overlook who contend\r\nthat the barrows came to Stonehenge. It is admitted that Stonehenge\r\nbelongs to the so-called Bronze age,[120] but one half of the barrows\r\ncontain only flint and stone, and consequently were there before\r\nStonehenge was built. Nor is it by any means the case that the nearest\r\nit were those which contained bronze or iron, it is generally quite the\r\ncontrary; with all his knowledge, even Sir R. Colt Hoare never could\r\nventure to predict from the locality whether the interment would be\r\nfound to belong to one class or to another, nor can we now.\r\n\r\nOne of the most direct proofs that this argument is untenable is found\r\nin the fact, that the builders of Stonehenge had so little respect for\r\nthe graves of their predecessors, that they actually destroyed two\r\nbarrows in making the vallum round the monument. Sir R. C. Hoare found\r\nan interment in one, and from this he adds, \"we may fairly infer that\r\nthis sepulchral barrow existed on the plain, I will not venture to say\r\nbefore the construction of Stonehenge, but probably before the ditch\r\nwas thrown up.\"[121]\r\n\r\nIt seems needless, however, to pursue the argument further. Any one who\r\nstudies carefully the Ordnance Survey sheet must, I think, perceive\r\nthat there is no connexion between the earthen and the stone monuments.\r\nOr if this fail to convince him, if he will ride from Stonehenge over\r\nWestdown to Chidbury camp,[122] he can hardly fail to come to the\r\nconclusion that Stonehenge came to the barrows, not the barrows to\r\nStonehenge.\r\n\r\nOne other indication drawn from the barrows has been thought to throw\r\nsome light on the subject. In one of those (No. 16) near Stonehenge,\r\nabout 300 yards off, were found chippings of the same blue stones\r\nwhich form the inner circle of the monuments; but there was nothing\r\nelse in this barrow to indicate its age except a spear-head of brass\r\nin fine preservation, and a pin of the same metal, which seemed to\r\nindicate that it belonged to the bronze age. In another (No. 22)\r\na pair of ivory tweezers were found. From this discovery it was\r\ninferred, and not without some show of reason, that the barrows were\r\nmore modern than Stonehenge; and if we are to believe that all barrows\r\nare pre-Christian, as some would try to persuade us, there is an end\r\nof the argument. But is this so? We have just seen that the Bartlow\r\nhills were certainly Roman. We know that the Saxons buried in hows\r\nin the country, down at least to Hubba the Dane,[123] who was slain\r\nin 878, and in Denmark, as we shall presently see, to a much later\r\nperiod; and we do not know when the Ancient Britons ceased to use\r\nthis mode of interment. Whoever they were that built Stonehenge,\r\nthey were not Christians; or, at all events, it is certainly not a\r\nChristian building, and we have no reason to assume that those men\r\nwho were employed on its erection, and who had for thousands of years\r\nbeen burying in barrows, changed their mode of sepulture before their\r\nconversion to Christianity. It is infinitely more probable that they\r\ncontinued the practice very long afterwards; and till we can fix\r\nsome time when we feel sure that sepulture in barrows had ceased,\r\nno argument can be drawn from this evidence. That the chief mason\r\nof Stonehenge should be buried in his own house, or own workshop,\r\nappears to us the most natural thing in the world; and that a village\r\nof barrows, if I may use the expression, may be contemporary with the\r\nmonument I regard also as probable; but unless from some external\r\nevidence we can fix their age, their existence does not seem to have\r\nany direct bearing on the points we are now discussing.\r\n\r\nThe diggings inside the area of Stonehenge throw more light on the\r\nsubject of our enquiry than anything found outside, but even they\r\nare not so distinct or satisfactory as might be desired. The first\r\nexploration was undertaken by the Duke of Buckingham, and an account of\r\nit is preserved by Aubrey. He says, \"In 1620 the duke, when King James\r\nwas at Wilton, did cause the middle of Stonehenge to be digged, and\r\nthis underdigging was the cause of the falling down and recumbencie of\r\nthe great stone there,\" meaning evidently the great central trilithon.\r\nIn the process of digging they \"found a great many bones of stagges\r\nand oxen, charcoal, batter dashes (whatever that may mean), heads of\r\narrows, and some pieces of armour eaten out with rust. Bones rotten,\r\nbut whether of stagges or of men they could not tell.\"[124] He further\r\nadds \"that Philip Earl of Pembroke did say that an altar stone was\r\nfound in the middle of the area here, and that it was carried away to\r\nSt. James'.\" What this means it is not easy to discern, for Inigo Jones\r\ndistinctly describes as the altar the stone now known by that name,\r\nwhich measures, as he says, 16 feet by 4. It seems impossible that any\r\nother could have existed without his knowing it, and if it existed it\r\nwould have favoured his views too distinctly for him not to mention the\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nAs the digging above referred to must have taken place between\r\nwhat is now called the altar stone and the great trilithon, it is\r\nof considerable interest to us. But strange to say it leaves us in\r\nignorance whether the bones found there were human or not; one thing,\r\nhowever, seems tolerably certain, that the arrow-heads and armour were\r\nof iron, from the state of rust they are described as being in, and\r\nthis so far is indicative of a post-Roman date.\r\n\r\nAnother curious fact is mentioned by Camden. In his plate (page 122),\r\nhalf plan, half elevation--at a spot marked C outside the vallum, men\r\nare represented as making an excavation, and the reference is \"Place\r\nwhere men's bones are dug up.\" This is of no great value in so far as\r\nStonehenge itself is concerned, but it is curious from its analogy with\r\nthe place where the bones were found on Hakpen Hill, and may serve as\r\nan indication to the spot where the bones may yet be found in Avebury.\r\nAs we shall see further on, there are strong reasons for believing\r\nthat the principal interment at least was not inside the circle, but\r\nsituated externally on one side.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times, Sir R. Colt Hoare adds--\"We have found, in\r\ndigging (within the circle), several fragments of Roman as well as\r\ncoarse British pottery, parts of the head and horns of deer and other\r\nanimals, and a large barbed arrow-head of iron,\" thus confirming what\r\nAubrey tells us of the Duke of Buckingham's excavation to the fullest\r\nextent. Mr. Cunnington also dug near the altar to a depth of nearly 6\r\nfeet, and found the chalk had been moved to that depth. At about the\r\ndepth of 3 feet he found some Roman pottery. Soon after the fall of the\r\ngreat trilithon, in 1797, he dug out some of the earth that had fallen\r\ninto the excavation, and \"found fragments of fine black Roman pottery,\r\nand since then another piece on the same spot.\"[125]\r\n\r\nNo excavation in the area has been undertaken since Sir R. Colt Hoare's\r\nday, but as both he and Mr. Cunnington were experienced diggers, and\r\nperfectly faithful recorders of what they found, it seems impossible\r\nto doubt, from the finding of iron armour and Roman pottery in such\r\nplaces, and at such depths that the building must have been erected\r\nafter the Romans settled in this island. As no one now will probably\r\nbe found to adopt Inigo Jones' theory that it was built by the Romans\r\nthemselves, we must look to some date after their departure to which we\r\nmay assign its erection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the written history of Stonehenge we are unfortunately forced\r\nto rely principally on Jeffrey of Monmouth, who, though a recorder\r\nof historical events, was also a fabulist of the most exuberant\r\nimagination. It is consequently easy to throw discredit on his\r\ntestimony, and some consider themselves justified in putting it aside\r\naltogether. If, however, we are to reject every mediæval author who\r\nrecords miracles, or adorns his tale with fables, we may as well shut\r\nup our books at once, and admit that, between the departure of the\r\nRomans and the arrival of the Normans, the history of England is a mere\r\nconfused jumble, in which may be found the names of some persons and\r\nof the battles they fought with one another, but nothing more. It is\r\nan easy process, and may be satisfactory to some minds. The attempt\r\nto separate the wheat from the chaff is a more tedious and laborious\r\ntask, surrounded by difficulties, and open to criticism, but it is one\r\nthat must be undertaken if truth is to be arrived at. In the present\r\ninstance the choice of difficulties seems to be clear. Either we must\r\nreject the history of Jeffrey as entirely fabulous and unworthy of\r\ncredit, or admit his principal statement that Stonehenge was erected by\r\nAurelius Ambrosius as a monument to the memory of the British chiefs\r\ntreacherously slain by Hengist.\r\n\r\nThe first account we have of the event which led to its erection is\r\nin Nennius, who lived much nearer to the time of the occurrence than\r\nJeffrey, who copied his narrative. It is as follows:--The Saxons having\r\nbeen defeated in several actions on the coast of Kent by Vortimir,\r\nwere shut up in Thanet and forced to wait till they could summon\r\nsuccour from home. When these arrived, Hengist, before attempting\r\nopen force, had recourse to stratagem, and at a feast held at the\r\npalace or monastery at Amesbury, to which it was agreed all should\r\ncome unarmed, three hundred British nobles were treacherously slain by\r\nthe followers of Hengist, who had concealed their weapons under their\r\ncloaks. War ensued on this, and lasted apparently for four years,\r\nwhen Ambrosius, who had succeeded to Vortigern, forced the Saxons to\r\nsue for peace.[126] That being established, Jeffrey represents him\r\nas erecting Stonehenge by the aid of Merlin as a monument to those\r\nwho were so treacherously slain by Hengist. The massacre took place\r\napparently in the year 462, and the erection of Stonehenge consequently\r\nmay have been commenced about the year 466, and carried on during the\r\nfollowing years, say down to 470 A.D. If he had been content\r\nto tell the story in as few words as are used here, it probably never\r\nwould have been doubted; but Merlin, in the first place, has a bad\r\ncharacter, for he is mixed up with the mediæval romances which made\r\nthe story of Arthur famous but fabulous, and the mode in which he\r\nis represented by Jeffrey as bringing the stones from Ireland is\r\nenough to induce incredulity in all sober minds.[127] As I understand\r\nthe narrative, it is this--there existed on a mountain in Ireland a\r\nmonument something like Stonehenge, which Merlin, when consulted,\r\nadvised the King to copy. This certainly is the view taken of the\r\nmatter by Geraldus Cambrensis in 1187, inasmuch as he tells us, that\r\nin the spot referred to \"similar stones, erected in a similar manner,\r\nwere to be seen in his day,\" though in the same sentence he tells us,\r\nthat they, or others like them, were removed to Salisbury Plain by\r\nMerlin.[128] As he probably speaks of what he saw with his own eyes,\r\nhis words furnish tolerably clear evidence that Merlin had not removed\r\nwhat still remained at Kildare so many centuries after his death. It\r\nis also evidence, however, that the design of the monument was brought\r\nfrom Ireland, and even copied from a circle, the remains of which may\r\nprobably still, if looked for, be found. So far as we know there was\r\nnothing like Stonehenge existing in England, nor in France, in the\r\n5th century. But, as we shall presently see, there probably may have\r\nbeen in Ireland. The only trilithons I know of elsewhere are three in\r\na monument in the Deer Park near Sligo. They are small and simulate\r\nportals, but they are more like Stonehenge than any else now known.\r\nAt the age we are now speaking of Ireland had contrived to nurse her\r\nold traditions uninfluenced by Roman or foreign examples, and had\r\nattained to that stage in art which would enable her to elaborate such\r\na style of architecture. While in England it is most improbable that\r\nanything so purely original could have been elaborated during the Roman\r\noccupation of the island. Still a monument like this must have had a\r\nprototype, and unless we can prove its existence here before Cæsar's\r\ntime, it is to Ireland or some foreign country that we must look\r\nfor the model that suggested the design. But, after all, are we not\r\nfighting with a shadow? May it not be that the tradition of a monument\r\nbeing brought from Ireland applies only to the blue stones? I have been\r\nassured by competent geologists, though I have not seen the fact stated\r\nin any form I can quote, that these belong to rocks not found in Great\r\nBritain, but which are common in Ireland. If this is so, there would\r\nbe no greater difficulty in bringing them from the Sister Island than\r\nfrom Wales or Cornwall. Once on board ship the difference of distance\r\nis nothing. If they did come from Ireland nothing is more likely than\r\nthat, after a lapse of eight or ten centuries, the facts belonging\r\nreally only to a part should be applied to the whole; and in that case\r\nthe aid of Merlin or of some equally powerful magician would certainly\r\nhave become indispensable. In that age, at least, I do not know any\r\nother agency that could have accomplished the transference, and I am\r\nnot at all surprised, under the circumstances, that Jeffrey arrived at\r\nthe same conclusion.\r\n\r\nThe true explanation of the mystery seems to be, that the design of\r\nStonehenge may have come from Ireland, the native style of art having\r\nbeen in abeyance in England during the Roman occupation, and that the\r\nblue stones most probably came from the Sister Island, which is quite\r\nenough to account for the Merlin myth; but of all this we shall be\r\nbetter able to judge when we have discussed the Irish antiquities of\r\nthe same age.\r\n\r\nTo return to our history, however, a little further on Jeffrey asserts\r\nthat Aurelius himself was buried \"near the convent of Ambrius within\r\nthe Giant's Dance (chorea gigantum), which in his lifetime he had\r\ncommanded to be made.\"[129] As far as it goes, this is a distinct\r\nassertion that the place was used for burial, otherwise from the\r\ncontext we would gather that the Britons slain by Hengist were buried\r\nin the cemetery attached to the monastery, and that Stonehenge was\r\nconsequently a cenotaph and not a monument. But again, in recording\r\nthe life of Constantine, the nephew and successor of Arthur, after\r\nrelating how he defeated the Saxons and took vengeance on the nephews\r\nof Mordred, he goes on to say--\"Three years after this he was killed\r\nby Conan, and buried close to Uther Pendragon, within the structure of\r\nstones which was set up with wonderful art, not far from Salisbury,\r\nand called in the English tongue Stonehenge.\"[130] This last event,\r\nthough no date is given, must have occurred some time between 546, or\r\nfour years after Arthur's death, and 552, the date of the battle of\r\nBanbury Hill, where Conan his successor commanded. Assuming for the\r\nmoment that this may be the case, may it not suffice to explain one of\r\nthe mysteries of Stonehenge, the presence of the pairs of blue stones\r\ninside the choir? Why may we not suppose that these were erected in\r\nmemory of the kings or others who were buried in front of them? Why\r\nmay not Aurelius and Constantine have been buried in front of the two\r\nsmall pairs at either end of the so-called altar stone? If this were\r\nso, and it appears to me extremely probable that it was, the last\r\nremains of the mist that hangs over the uses of this monument would be\r\ndispersed.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Jeffrey (1147) all subsequent mediæval historians\r\nadopt the account of these events given by him, with occasional but\r\ngenerally slight variations, and even modern critics are inclined to\r\naccept his account of Constantine and Conan, as his narrative can\r\nbe checked by that of Gildas, who was cotemporary with these kings.\r\nSimilar statements are also found in the triads of the Welsh bards,\r\nwhich some contend are original and independent authorities.[131]\r\nMy own impression is that they may be so, but I do not think their\r\nindependence has been so clearly established as to enable us to found\r\nany argument upon it. On the other hand, the incidental allusion of\r\nJeffrey to the erection of Stonehenge as a cenotaph to the slain\r\nnobles, and the subsequent burial there of the two kings, seems so\r\nlikely and natural that it is difficult to see why they should be\r\nconsidered as inventions. The two last-named events, at all events, do\r\nnot add to the greatness or wonder of the kings, or of his narrative,\r\nand are not such things as would be inserted in the page of history,\r\nunless they were currently known, or were recorded somewhere in some\r\nwriting to which the historian had access.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting Stonehenge there is one other antiquity connected with\r\nit, regarding which it is necessary to say a few words. Both in Sir R.\r\nColt Hoare's plan and the Ordnance Survey, there are marked two oblong\r\nenclosures called the greater and lesser \"Cursus,\" and along which\r\nthe antiquaries of the last century amused themselves by picturing\r\nthe chariot races of the Ancient Britons, though as they ascribed the\r\nintroduction of races to the Romans, they admitted that they must have\r\nbeen formed after the subjection of the island by that people.[132] The\r\ngreater cursus is about a mile and three-quarters long, by 110 yards\r\nwide. The smaller is so indistinct that only its commencement can be\r\nidentified; but even as concerns the larger, I walked twice across it\r\nwithout perceiving its existence, though I was looking for it, and no\r\none I fancy would remark it if his attention were not turned to it.\r\nIts boundary mounds never could have been 3 feet high, and now in many\r\nplaces are very nearly obliterated.\r\n\r\nThat these alignments were once race-courses, appears to me one of the\r\nmost improbable of the various conjectures which have been hazarded\r\nwith regard even to Stonehenge. No Roman race-course, that we know\r\nof, omitted to provide for the horses returning at least once past\r\nthe place they started from, and no course was even a mile, much less\r\na mile and three-quarters long. What sort of horse-races the British\r\nindulged in before the Conquest I don't know, nor will I hazard an\r\nopinion on the subject; but if they wanted the races to be seen, there\r\nare several beautiful and appropriate spots close at hand where they\r\ncould have laid out a longer course along one of the bottoms, where\r\ntens of thousands might conveniently have witnessed the sport from\r\nthe sloping banks on either hand, whereas here only the front rank\r\ncould have seen the race at all, and that imperfectly. It may also be\r\nremarked that the east end of the cursus is closed by a mound which\r\nmust have been a singularly awkward position for the judges, though\r\nthat is the place assigned to them by Sir Richard; and the west end is\r\ncut off also by an embankment, behind which are several tumuli on the\r\ncourse, which seems a very unlikely racing arrangement.\r\n\r\nBut if not race-courses, what were they? If any one will turn back\r\nto woodcut No. 12, p. 55, representing the alignments at Merivale\r\nbridge, and compare them with the cursus as shown in woodcut No. 26,\r\np. 102, representing the ground about Stonehenge, I think he must\r\nperceive that the two cursus, if complete, would occupy exactly the\r\nsame relative position with regard to Stonehenge--on a much larger\r\nscale of course--as those at Dartmoor do to the circle there. The\r\narrangements are so similar that the purposes can hardly be different.\r\nAt first sight this seems to tell against the battle theory. We know\r\nof no battle fought on Salisbury Plain. This, however, is the merest\r\nnegative assumption possible. We know that the massacre at Amesbury was\r\nfollowed by a four years' war, between Ambrosius and the Saxons.[133]\r\nBattles there must have been, and many, and what so likely as that the\r\ncrowning victory should have been fought in the immediate proximity of\r\nthe capital of one of the contending parties. If these cursus do mark\r\nthe battle-field, it will at once account for the somewhat anomalous\r\nposition of Stonehenge. What is so likely as that the victor should\r\nhave chosen the field of his final victory to erect there a monument\r\nto the memory of those whose treacherous slaughter had been the cause\r\nof the war? Of course this is only an hypothesis, and it is only put\r\nforward as such, but it seems to me infinitely nearer the truth than\r\nthat of the gratuitous suggestion of a race-course, and looks like one\r\nof the coincidences sure to occur when the investigation is on the\r\nright path towards the true solution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first impression that the narrative of the preceding pages will\r\nconvey to most readers, will probably be that there must be something\r\nmore to be said on the subject, or that something important is left\r\nout. If, it may be argued, the case is so clear as here stated, it\r\ncould never have been doubted, and must have been accepted long ago.\r\nAll I can say in answer is, that if anything is omitted I am not aware\r\nof it. Everything I know of has been stated as fully and as fairly as\r\nseemed necessary for its being clearly understood. In this instance it\r\nmust be remembered that the usual arguments drawn from the division\r\ninto stone, bronze, and iron ages hardly come into play. Nothing has\r\nbeen found inside Stonehenge but iron and Roman pottery. Even admitting\r\nthe barrows in the immediate proximity of Stonehenge to be coeval,\r\nbefore their testimony can be of any avail, it must be ascertained when\r\nmen ceased to be buried in barrows, and when a man might not wish a\r\nbronze spear-head to be entombed with him as a relic, even if he did\r\nnot fight with it in his lifetime. Even then, however, the evidence\r\nwould be too indistinct to outweigh that of the finds inside the circle.\r\n\r\nIf, after what has been said above, any one still maintains that\r\nStonehenge is a temple, and not sepulchral, we have no common ground\r\nfrom which to reason, and need not attempt it. Or if any one as\r\nfamiliar with the locality as I am personally, or who has studied the\r\nOrdnance maps with the same care, likes to argue that the barrows came\r\nto Stonehenge, and not Stonehenge to the barrows, we see things with\r\nsuch different eyes that we equally want a common basis for argument.\r\n\r\nIn a case like the present, however, the great difficulty to be\r\novercome is not so much cool argument and close reasoning, as a certain\r\nundefined feeling that a monument must be old because we know so little\r\nabout it. \"Omne ignotum pro antiquo\" is a matter of faith with many\r\nwho will listen to no argument to the contrary, and in the case of\r\nStonehenge the false notion has been so fostered by nearly all those\r\nwho have written about it since the time of James I., that it will be\r\nvery difficult now to overthrow it. Those who adhere to it, however,\r\nhardly realize how dark the ages were between the departure of the\r\nRomans and the time of Alfred the Great, and how much may have been\r\ndone in that time without any record of it coming down to our day. Even\r\nif we give them all the megalithic monuments we possess, it is very\r\nlittle indeed for so large a population in so long a time.\r\n\r\nEven at a much later period of English history than we are now occupied\r\nwith, it is wonderful how little we should know of our monuments if we\r\ndepended on the \"litera scripta\" for our information. Any one who is\r\nfamiliar with the guide-books of the last, or beginning of the present\r\ncentury, will see what dire confusion of dates existed with regard to\r\nthe erection of our greatest cathedrals and mediæval monuments. Saxon\r\nand Norman were confounded everywhere, and the distinction of any of\r\nthe styles between Early English and Perpendicular was not appreciated,\r\nand frequently the dates were reversed. In fact, it was not till\r\nRickman took the matter in hand that order emerged out of chaos, and he\r\nsucceeded because his constructive knowledge enabled him to perceive\r\nprogressive developments which formed true sequences, and he was thus\r\nable to supply the want of written information. Every tyro now can fix\r\na date to every moulding in any of our mediæval buildings, but if we\r\nhad only written history to depend upon, in nine cases out of ten he\r\ncould not prove that the building was not erected by the Romans or the\r\nPhœnicians, or anybody else. If this is the case in an age when\r\nwriting was so common as between the Conquest and the Reformation,\r\nshould we be surprised if we find matters so much darker between the\r\ndeparture of the Romans and Alfred, when written history hardly helps\r\nus at all? But Rickman's method will, when applied to Stonehenge and\r\nsimilar monuments, if I am not very much mistaken, render their dates\r\nnearly as clear as those of our mediæval monuments have been rendered\r\nby the same method.\r\n\r\nNone but those who have had occasion specially to study the subject\r\ncan be aware how devoid of all literary records the period is of\r\nwhich we are now treating. So meagre and so scarce are they, that\r\nmany well-informed persons doubt whether such a person as King Arthur\r\never lived; and scarcely one of his great actions is established by\r\nanything like satisfactory contemporary testimony. Yet, in all ages,\r\nand in all countries where histories either written or oral exist, they\r\nare filled with the exploits of favourite national heroes--as Arthur\r\nwas--which, even where they are fullest and most diffuse, it is the\r\nrarest possible thing to find in them a record of the building of any\r\ntemple or tomb. From the building of the Parthenon to the completion\r\nof Henry VIII.'s Chapel, the notices of buildings in general histories\r\nare as few and meagre as may be, and are comprised in a few paragraphs\r\nscattered through many hundred volumes. No one, I am convinced, who\r\nhas thought twice on the subject, would expect to find any notice of\r\nbuildings in the few pages which are all we possess of history between\r\nthe departure of the Romans and the time of the Venerable Bede; yet the\r\nabsence of record is the argument which, if I am not mistaken, has had\r\nmore influence on the popular mind than almost any other. Too generally\r\nit is assumed that, as we know nothing about them, they must be old. To\r\nme, on the contrary, nothing appears so extremely improbable as that\r\nthe builders, while leaving no record of their exploits, should have\r\nleft any written account of the erection of the Rude Stone Monuments.\r\n\r\nOne other point seems worth alluding to before concluding this chapter,\r\nwhich is that nothing has been advanced, so far as I know, that would\r\nlead us to suppose that the people of this island were, before the time\r\nof the Romans, either more numerous or more powerful, and consequently\r\nmore capable of erecting such monuments as Stonehenge and Avebury,\r\nthan they were after that people had resided for four centuries among\r\nthem. All our existing knowledge seems to tend to a diametrically\r\nopposite conclusion, and now that the day for vague declamation and _à\r\npriori_ reasoning is past, if any proof to the contrary can be brought\r\nforward, it would be well that it were now adduced, for otherwise\r\njudgment may go by default. If we mistake not, the case must be strong\r\nand clear that is to outweigh the evidence just brought forward in\r\nreference to the two monuments the use and age of which we have just\r\nbeen discussing.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 77: These particulars are taken from a careful survey\r\n    made by Sir R.

If this is\r\nso, it will not be necessary to repeat the same evidence in treating of\r\nthose monuments or groups we are about to describe. Incidentally the\r\nlatter will, if I am not mistaken, afford many confirmations of those\r\npropositions, but it will not be necessary to insist or enlarge on them\r\nto the same extent as has been done in the previous pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 27. Countless Stones, Aylesford. From a drawing by\r\nStukeley.]\r\n\r\nAmong the remaining groups of stones in England, one of the most\r\nimportant is--or rather was--that in front of Aylesford in Kent. The\r\nbest known member of this group is that known as Kit's Cotty--or\r\nCoity-house, which has, however, been so often drawn and described\r\nthat it is hardly necessary to do much more than refer to it here.\r\nIt is a dolmen, composed of four stones, three upright; the two\r\nside stones being about 8 feet square and 2 in thickness, the third\r\nsomewhat smaller; these form three sides of a chamber, the fourth\r\nside being--and apparently always having been--left open. These\r\nthree support a cap stone measuring 11 feet by 8 feet. If we can\r\ntrust Stukeley's drawing,[134] it was an external dolmen standing on\r\nthe end of a low long barrow. At the other end of the mound lay an\r\nobelisk, since removed, but in Stukeley's time it was said to mark\r\n\"the general's grave.\" The mound has since been levelled by the\r\nplough, but the whole forms an arrangement so common both in England\r\nand in Scandinavia, that I am inclined to place faith in the drawing.\r\nSo little, however, hinges on it here that it is not worth while\r\ninsisting on it, but a trench across the site of the barrow might lead\r\nto interesting results. Nearly due south of Kit's Cotty-house, at the\r\ndistance of about 500 yards, is another monument of the same class,\r\npopularly known as the Countless Stones, but so ruined--apparently\r\nby searchers after treasure--that its plan cannot now be made out.\r\nIn Stukeley's time, however, it was more perfect, and as his pencil\r\nis always more to be trusted than his pen, it may be worth while to\r\nreproduce his drawings,[135] for the arrangement of the stones was\r\npeculiar, but may have analogies elsewhere. Between these two a third\r\ndolmen is said to have existed within the memory of man, but no trace\r\nof it is now to be found. In the rear of these groups, nearer the\r\nvillage, there exists, or existed, a line of great stones, extending\r\nfrom a place called Spring Farm, in a north-easterly direction, for\r\na distance of three-quarters of a mile, to another spot known as\r\nHale Farm,[136] passing through Tollington, where the greater number\r\nof the stones are now found. In front of the line near the centre\r\nat Tollington lie two obelisks, known to the country people as the\r\ncoffin-stones--probably from their shape. They are 12 feet long by 4 to\r\n6 broad, and about 2 or 3 feet thick.[137] They appear to be partially\r\nhewn, or at least shaped, so as to resemble one another.\r\n\r\nBesides these stones, which are all on the right bank of the river,\r\nthere are several groups at or near Addington, about five miles to the\r\nwestward of Aylesford. Two of these in the park at Addington have long\r\nbeen known to antiquaries, having been described and figured in the\r\n'Archæologia' in 1773.[138] The first is a small circle, about 11 feet\r\nin diameter, the six stones comprising it being 19 feet high, 7 wide,\r\nand 2 in thickness. Near it is the larger one of oval form, measuring\r\n50 paces by 42 paces. The stones are generally smaller than those of\r\nthe other circle. The other groups or detached stones are described\r\nby Mr. Wright,[139] who went over the ground with that excellent and\r\nvenerable antiquary the Rev. L. B. Larking. They seem to have adopted\r\nthe common opinion that an avenue of such stones existed all the way\r\nfrom Addington to Aylesford, but it seems to me that there is no\r\nsufficient evidence to justify this conclusion. Many of the stones\r\nseem natural boulders, and in no place is any alignment distinctly\r\nperceptible.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, Mr. Wright found, and attempted to excavate some\r\nsmaller monuments of a sepulchral character, near Kit's Cotty House,\r\nbut situated on the brow of the hill immediately above it. These\r\n\"consist generally of groups of stones buried partly on the ridge of\r\nthe hill, but evidently forming, or having formed, small sepulchral\r\nchambers.\" \"Each group,\" he adds, \"is generally surrounded by a circle\r\nof stones.\"[140]\r\n\r\nThere only now remains the question, why were all these stones placed\r\nhere, and by whom? Mr. Wright is far too sober and too well-informed\r\nan antiquary to repeat the usual nonsense about such monuments having\r\nbeen Druid temples or altars. The conclusion at which he arrives (p.\r\n183) is that Kit's Cotty-house, and the cemetery around it, with\r\nthat in the parish of Addington, together formed the grand necropolis\r\nof the Belgian settlers in this part of the island. Against this\r\nit must be observed that the Belgians erected no such monuments in\r\ntheir own country, Gallia Belgica being exactly that part of France\r\nin which no stone monuments are found, and it is very unlikely that\r\nthe Belgians should have done here what they did not do at home. But\r\nanother objection is, that the theory is wholly gratuitous, no shadow\r\nof tradition, no analogy, and no reason being adduced to show why it\r\nshould be so, and, to say the least of it, it is most unlikely. If a\r\nstraight line were drawn from the mouth of the Humber to the head of\r\nSouthampton Water, this is the only group of this class of monuments\r\nto the eastward of the line, and what possible reason can we have for\r\nsupposing that the princes or people of that vast district chose this\r\nplace, and this only, for their necropolis? Had it been some vast plain\r\nlike Salisbury, or some gloomy valley, or the site of some ancient\r\nsacred city, the choice might have been intelligible, but a more\r\nunromantic, unlikely spot than the valley of the Medway could hardly\r\nhave been chosen. It is neither central nor accessible, and neither\r\nhistory nor tradition lends any countenance to the suggestion.\r\n\r\nSuppose, on the other hand, we assume that these erections are a record\r\nof the battle which, according to the Saxon chronicle,[141] was fought\r\non this spot between Vortigern and Hengist and Horsa, in the year 455,\r\nand in which Catigren was slain on the side of the British, and the\r\nredoubted Horsa fell on that of the Saxons. This at least has the merit\r\nof accounting for all we see--the line of stones at Tollington is just\r\nsuch a position as the British army would take up, to cover the ford at\r\nAylesford against an enemy advancing from Thanet. The two obelisks in\r\nfront would represent the position of the two chiefs; Kit's Cotty-house\r\nwould become the tomb of Catigren, which tradition always represented\r\nit to be; the circles at Addington would become the graves of chiefs\r\nwho were wounded in the battle, and taken to the rear and buried with\r\ndue honours, at or near the spot where they died; and lastly the\r\ntumulus at Horstead would also in accordance with ancient tradition be\r\nthe grave of Horsa.\r\n\r\nSo much depends on this last determination, that last year through the\r\nkindness of Colonel Fisher, R.E., the assistance of a party of sappers\r\nwas procured from Chatham, and the mound was thoroughly explored. It\r\nwas found that a cremation (it is presumed of a human body) had taken\r\nplace on the natural surface of the ground, and that a tumulus had\r\nbeen raised over it. The chalk was dug down to some depth and found\r\nquite undisturbed, but no ornament or implement was found anywhere. At\r\nfirst this seemed disappointing; but on Mr. Godfrey Faussett, who was\r\npresent at the digging, referring to certain passages in 'Beowulf,' it\r\nappears to be exactly what should have been expected. The poem, in the\r\nfirst place, is about the best authority we could have, inasmuch as,\r\naccording to Kemble, \"it gave accounts of exploits not far removed, in\r\npoint of time, from the crossing of Hengist and Horsa into Britain, and\r\nthe poem was probably brought hither by some of those Anglo-Saxons,\r\nwho, in 495, accompanied Cerdic and Cyneric.\"[142] After Hengist's\r\nconflict with Fin, the body was burnt (l. 2232-2251); but after\r\nBeowulf's death not only cremation is mentioned, but a splendid mound\r\nis raised over the spot where the funeral pile stood, \"ad on Eorthen\"\r\n(l. 6266), on the surface of the ground. At Beowulf's funeral, vases,\r\nand arms, and jewels of all kinds, were thrown upon the pile and burnt\r\nwith him; and no wonder, considering the wealth just rescued from the\r\nguardianship of the \"Wurm\" by the victorious hero. Poor Horsa died\r\ndefeated, and all his friends could expect would be to be allowed to\r\nbury him under a flag of truce, with such rites as would ensure his\r\nproper reception in the next world. Had they attempted to bury any\r\ntreasures with him, they probably would have been appropriated by the\r\nvictorious Brits.\r\n\r\nBede's expression that Horsa's tomb was situated in \"orientalibus\r\npartibus Cantiæ,\"[143] has more than once been quoted to disprove this\r\nidentification. But what did Bede mean by \"eastern parts\"? May it\r\nnot have been that in his day the Medway divided Kent into east and\r\nwest? Or he may have spoken without sufficient local knowledge. But\r\nthat Horsa fell at Aylesford, is as well authenticated as any fact in\r\nthat age: he most probably was buried near the battle-field; and the\r\nvillage where the mound is situated has probably ever since been called\r\nHorstead, as it is at this day.\r\n\r\nAll this, it appears to me, makes so strong a case, that I cannot help\r\nthinking it might be accepted till, at least, something is advanced\r\nagainst it. At present I am not aware of any argument to the contrary\r\nthat seems to me entitled to any serious consideration. No flint, or\r\nbronze, or iron implement of any sort, so far as I know, have been\r\nfound on the spot--this may be only because they have not been looked\r\nfor; but as the case at present stands, the Danish system cannot be\r\npleaded for or against this view.\r\n\r\nThe real difficulty to be feared in obtaining acceptance of this\r\nexplanation of the stone at Aylesford, is its extreme simplicity.\r\nAfter all that has been written about the unfathomable mystery and the\r\nprimæval antiquity of this class of monuments, to be told that these\r\nare merely the memorials of a battle fought on the spot in the year\r\n455, is too terribly prosaic to be tolerated, nor ought it perhaps to\r\nbe accepted if it stood alone. If, however, it proves to be only one of\r\nmany instances, the ultimate admission of the above views can hardly be\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\nASHDOWN.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Uffington, in Berkshire, there are three\r\nmonuments, two at least of which still merit a local habitation and a\r\nname in our history. One of these is the celebrated white horse, which\r\ngives its name to the vale, and the scouring of which is still used by\r\nthe inhabitants of the neighbourhood on the occasion of a triennial\r\nfestival and games, which have been so graphically described by Mr.\r\nThomas Hughes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 28. The Sarsen Stones at Ashdown. From a drawing by A.\r\nL. Lewis, Esq.]\r\n\r\nThe second is a cromlech, known as Wayland Smith's Cave, and\r\nimmortalized by the use made of it by Sir Walter Scott in the novel\r\nof 'Kenilworth.' The third is as remarkable as either, but still wants\r\nits poet. The annexed woodcut will give a fair idea of its nature and\r\nextent.[144] It does not pretend to be minutely accurate, and this\r\nin the present instance is fortunately of no great consequence. All\r\nthe stones are overthrown: some lie flat on the ground, some on their\r\nedges, and it is only the smallest that can be said to be standing. The\r\nconsequence is, that we cannot feel sure that we know exactly where\r\nany of them stood, nor whether they were arranged in lines, like those\r\nat Carnac; nor if so, in how many rows, or whether they always had\r\nthe confused appearance they now present. They are spread over an area\r\nof about 1600 feet north and south, and of half that distance east\r\nand west. The gap in the centre was made purposely to clear the view\r\nin front of the house when it was built, and many of the stones it is\r\nfeared were employed in the erection. They are the same Sarsens as are\r\nused at Avebury and Stonehenge, and the largest are about 10 feet long\r\nfrom 6 to 9 wide, and from 3 to 4 feet high (in their present recumbent\r\nposition); but there are few so large as this, the majority being from\r\n2 to 4 feet in length and breadth, and from 1 to 3 high.[145]\r\n\r\nNo one has yet attempted to give any explanation of the monument\r\nbeyond repeating the usual Druidical formulæ. To me it appears almost\r\nincontestable that it is a memorial of the battle fought here between\r\nthe Saxons and the Danes in the year 871. From Asser we learn that\r\nthe Pagans, advancing from Reading, occupied the higher ground. It is\r\nsometimes supposed that Uffington Castle was thrown up by them on the\r\noccasion, which is by no means impossible. Advancing eastward, they\r\nthen attacked the Christians under Alfred, who occupied the lower\r\nground. This, and the ill-timed fit of devotion on his brother's\r\npart, nearly lost the Christians the day; but Alfred's skill and\r\nintrepidity prevailed, and the victory was complete.[146] This being\r\nso, nothing appears more probable than that the victorious army, either\r\nby themselves or with the assistance of the peasantry, should have\r\ncollected together the Sarsens in the neighbourhood, and have arranged\r\nthem as Alfred and his army stood, when he first received the shock\r\nof the Pagans. It seems also probable that he would have engraved the\r\nemblem of the white horse on the side of the hill where the Pagans had\r\nencamped the night before the battle, and where probably the fight\r\nended on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe question whether Weyland Smith's Cave belongs to the same group, or\r\nto an earlier date, is not so easily settled. My impression is that it\r\nis older. It is a three-chambered dolmen almost identical in plan with\r\nPetrie's No. 27, Carrowmore, to be described in the next chapter, but\r\nwith this difference, that whereas the circle of stones in the Irish\r\nexample contained thirty-six or thirty-seven stones, and was 60 feet\r\nin diameter, this one contained probably only twenty-eight, and was\r\nonly 50 feet in diameter. This and the fact of the one consisting of\r\nSarsens--the other of granite blocks--account so completely for all the\r\ndifference between them, that I cannot believe that so great a lapse\r\nof time as eight centuries could have taken place between the erection\r\nof the two. I fancy it must have been erected for the entombment of a\r\nlocal hero in the early centuries of the Christian era; but of this we\r\nwill be better able to judge when we are further advanced in our survey\r\nof similar monuments.\r\n\r\n\r\nROLLRIGHT.\r\n\r\nAt Rollright, between Chipping Norton and Long Compton, in Oxfordshire,\r\nthere is a circle, which, from what has been written about it, has\r\nassumed an importance in the antiquarian world, which is certainly\r\nnot due either to its dimensions or to any traditions that attach to\r\nit. Every antiquary, from Camden down to Bathurst Deane, has thought\r\nit necessary to say something about this splendid temple of the Druid\r\npriesthood, so that the traveller, when he visits it, is sure to\r\nbe dreadfully disappointed. It is an ordinary 100-foot circle, the\r\nentrance to which is apparently from the south opposite to the five\r\nlargest stones, which are placed in juxtaposition on the north, the\r\ntallest in the centre being about 5 feet in height. The others average\r\nabout 3 or 4 feet, but are uneven in height and irregularly spaced,\r\nbut with a tendency to form groups of threes, which is a peculiarity\r\nobservable-in some similar circles on Dartmoor.\r\n\r\nAcross the road, at a distance of about 50 yards, stands a single\r\nobeliscal stone, about 10 feet high, on a mound which appears to be\r\nartificial. If it is so, however, it was raised with the materials\r\ntaken out of a pit, which still exists on one side, and not from a\r\nditch surrounding it, as is usual in such cases. In another direction,\r\nabout a quarter of a mile from the circle, stands a dolmen, which is\r\nthe finest feature in the group. The cap stone, which has fallen,\r\nmeasures 8 feet by 9, and is of considerable thickness; and three of\r\nthe supporting stones are 7, 8, and 10 feet in height respectively.\r\n\r\nThis circle appears to have been examined by Ralph Sheldon, but without\r\nresults.[147] The mound, so far as is known, is yet untouched, and the\r\ndolmen could not now be explored without causing its complete ruin; I\r\npresume no one will contest its being sepulchral. It would be difficult\r\nnow to bring to the test of experiment the question whether the circle\r\nis so or not, as some forty or fifty years ago, it and the plot round\r\nit were planted with larch trees, whose roots have spread over the\r\nsurface and could with difficulty be now got rid of. This is to be\r\nregretted, as from its isolated position the group affords an excellent\r\nopportunity of testing the usual theories regarding these monuments.\r\nIf it was a temple, it gives us a very low idea of the religious state\r\nof our ancestors, that for a district of from twenty to thirty miles'\r\nradius they should have possessed only one single small enclosure,\r\nsurrounded by a low imperfect wall, 3 or 4 feet high. If any other\r\nhad ever existed, traces of it must have been found, or why has this\r\none remained so complete, for not one stone apparently is missing. It\r\nis also strange that, as in other instances, it should be situated on\r\nthe highest and bleakest part of the surrounding country. It is, in\r\nfact, not only the unlikeliest form, but the most inconvenient site\r\nfor a temple. It also gives us a very low idea of their civilization.\r\nThe circle at Rollright is a sort of monument that the boys of any of\r\nour larger schools could set up in a week, supposing the stones to be\r\nfound lying about, at no great distance, which there is little doubt\r\nwas the case when it was erected. The dolmen might require a little\r\ncontrivance to get the cap stone hoisted; but there is nothing that the\r\nvillagers in the neighbourhood could not now complete in a few days, if\r\nso inclined, and certainly nothing that a victorious army, of say even\r\n1000 men, could not complete between sunrise and sunset in a summer's\r\nday. Even if the sepulchral character of the group is admitted, it can\r\nhardly be the burying-ground of a chief, or clan, or family. In that\r\ncase, instead of one dolmen there must have been several, smaller\r\nit may be, but in succession. The chief must have had ancestors, or\r\nsuccessors, or relations, and they would not be content that one, and\r\none only, of their family should possess an honoured tomb, and that\r\nthey themselves should rest in undistinguished graves. As in other\r\ncases, unless we are prepared to admit that it marks the site of a\r\nbattle, I know of nothing that will explain the situation and the form\r\nof the group; nor do I see why we should reject Camden's explanation of\r\nthe circumstances under which it was erected: \"These would, I verily\r\nthink, to have been the monument of some victory, and haply erected\r\nby Rollo the Dane, who afterwards conquered Normandy.\" \"In what time\r\nhe with the Danes troubled England with depredations we read that the\r\nDanes joined battle with the English thereby at Hock Norton, a place\r\nfor no one thing more famous in old time than for the woeful slaughter\r\nof the English on that foughten field, under the reign of King Edward\r\nthe Elder.\"[148] This last, however, is apparently a mistake, for it\r\nwas Eadward (901-923) who was really the contemporary of Rollo. He was\r\nalso the contemporary of Gorm the Old, of Denmark, of whose tumulus and\r\nPagan habits we shall hear hereafter.\r\n\r\nThis again will appear a very prosaic anti-climax to those who are\r\nnursed on ideas of the hoar antiquity and wondrous magnificence of such\r\nmonuments as Ashdown and Rollright. A visit to them is sufficient to\r\ndispel one part of that illusion, and a little common-sense applied\r\nto the other will probably show that the more moderate view meets\r\nperfectly all the real exigencies of the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENRITH.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Penrith in Cumberland there is a group, or\r\nperhaps it should be said there are three groups of monuments, of\r\nconsiderable importance from their form and size, but deficient in\r\ninterest from the absence of any tradition to account for their being\r\nwhere we find them. They extend in a nearly straight line from Little\r\nSalkeld on the north to Shap on the south, a distance of fourteen miles\r\nas the crow flies, Penrith lying a little to the westward of the line,\r\nand nearer to its northern than its southern extremity.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile from the first named village is the circle known\r\npopularly as Long Meg and her Daughters, sixty-eight in number, if each\r\nstone represents one. It is about 330 feet (100 metres) in diameter,\r\nbut does not form a perfect circle. The stones are unhewn boulders,\r\nand very few of them are now erect. Outside the circle stands Long\r\nMeg herself, of a different class of stone from the others, about\r\n12 feet high, and apparently hewn, or at all events shaped, to some\r\nextent.[149] Inside the circle, Camden reports \"the existence of two\r\ncairns of stone, under which they say are dead bodies buried; and\r\nindeed it is probable enough,\" he adds, \"that it has been a monument\r\nerected in honour of some victory.\"[150] No trace of these cairns now\r\nremains, nor am I aware that the centre has ever been dug into with a\r\nview of looking for interments. My impression, however, is that the\r\nprincipal interment was outside, and that Long Meg marks either the\r\nhead or the foot of the chief's grave.\r\n\r\nClose to Penrith is another circle called Mayborough, of about the\r\nsame dimensions--100 metres--as that at Little Salkeld, but of a very\r\ndifferent construction. The vallum or enclosure is entirely composed\r\nof small water-worn stones taken from the beds of the Eamount or Eden\r\nrivers. The stones are wonderfully uniform in size, and just about\r\nwhat any man could carry without inconvenience. This enclosure mound\r\nis now so mined that it is extremely difficult to guess what were\r\nits dimensions. It may have been from 15 feet to 20 feet high, and\r\ntwice that in breadth at its base. The same cause makes it difficult\r\nto determine the dimensions of the internal area. The floor of the\r\ncircle I calculated as 290 feet from the foot of one slope to the foot\r\nof the opposite one, and consequently the whole as from 320 feet to\r\n340 feet[151] from crest to crest; but these dimensions must be taken\r\nas only approximative till a more careful survey is made than it was\r\nin my power to execute. Near, but not quite in the centre, stands a\r\nsingle splendid monolith; it may be 12 feet in height, but is more than\r\ntwice the bulk of Long Meg. In Pennant's time there were four stones\r\nstill standing in the centre, of which this was one, and probably\r\nthere may originally have been several more forming a small circle\r\nin the centre.[152] In his day also he learned that there were four\r\nstones--two pairs--standing in a gap in the vallum looking like the\r\ncommencement of an avenue. The place, however, is too near Penrith, and\r\nstone is there too valuable to allow of such things escaping, so that\r\nnothing now remains which would enable us to restore this monument with\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nClose by this is a third circle known as Arthur's Round Table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 29. Sketch Plan of King Arthur's Round Table, with the\r\nside, obliterated by the road, restored.]\r\n\r\nIt consists, or consisted, of a vallum of earth, as near as can be\r\nmade out, 300 feet from crest to crest; but about one-third of the\r\ncircle being cut away to form a road, it is not easy to speak with\r\ncertainty. Inside the rampart is a broad berm, then a ditch, and in\r\nthe centre a plateau about 170 feet in diameter, slightly raised in\r\nthe centre. No stone is visible on the surface, though the rampart\r\nwhen broken into shows that it is principally composed of them. There\r\nis now only one entrance through the rampart and across the ditch, but\r\nas both entrances existed in Pennant's time (1772), and are figured in\r\nhis plan of the monument, I have not hesitated to restore the second\r\naccordingly.[153] The distance between Mayborough and King Arthur's\r\nRound Table is about 110 yards, and at about the same distance from\r\nthe last-named monument, a third circle existed in Pennant's time. It\r\nseems, however, to have been in his day at least only a circular ditch,\r\nand has now entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nOwing to their more ruined state, the remains at Shap are more\r\ndifficult to describe. They were, however, visited by Stukeley in 1725,\r\nbut he complains it rained all the time that he was there, and rain on\r\na bleak exposed moor like Shap is singularly inimical to antiquarian\r\npursuits.[154] The remains were also described by Camden,[155] but\r\nnot apparently from personal observation, and others have described\r\nthem since, but the destruction has been so rapid, the village being\r\nalmost entirely built out of them, that it is now extremely difficult\r\nto ascertain what they really were. All, however, are agreed that the\r\nprincipal monument was an alignment, according to some of a double\r\nrow of stones, of which others can only trace a single row. So far\r\nas I could make out on the spot, it commenced near a spot called\r\nthe Thunder-stone, in the north, where there are seven large stones\r\nin a field; six are arranged as a double row; the seventh seems to\r\ncommence a single line, from this all the way to a place at the\r\nsouthern extremity of the village, called Karl Lofts, single stones\r\nmay be traced at intervals, in apparently a perfectly straight line\r\nand still beyond this, at a farmyard called Brackenbyr, Mr. Simpson\r\nfancied he could, in 1859, trace the remains of a circle 400 feet in\r\ndiameter, with a large obelisk in the centre.[156] I confess I was not\r\nso fortunate in 1869, and I also differ from him as to the position of\r\nthe stone row. He seems to fancy, from the description of Stukeley,\r\nthat it was situated to the southward of Karl Lofts, though he could\r\nnot detect any traces of it. My impression is that it commenced\r\nwith the circle at Brackenbyr, immediately south of Karl Lofts, and\r\nproceeded in a north-westerly direction for nearly a mile and a half to\r\nthe Thunder-stone, as before mentioned. Rather more than half a mile\r\ndue south of Brackenbyr stands a portion of what was once a very fine\r\ncircle. It was partially destroyed by the railway, but seems to have\r\nbeen a hundred-foot circle, and to have stood considerably in advance\r\nof the line of the avenue, in the same relative position to the stone\r\nrow as the circle at Merivale Bridge (woodcut No. 12), or as Stonehenge\r\nto its cursus (woodcut No. 26), whether we assume that it was continued\r\nin this direction, or terminated as above indicated. In front of the\r\ncircle is a noble tumulus, called Kemp How, in which the body of a man\r\nof gigantic stature is said to have been found.[157]\r\n\r\nAccording to the popular tradition the stone avenue originally\r\nextended to Muir Divock, a distance of rather more than five miles,\r\nto which it certainly points. Though this is most improbable, it is\r\nnot wholly without reason, as on Muir Divock there are five or six\r\ncircles of stone and several tumuli. The circles have most of them\r\nbeen opened recently, and in all instances were found to contain\r\ncists or other evidence of interments.[158] Immediately over the Muir\r\nstands a commanding hill, 1747 feet high, marked on the Ordnance\r\nSurvey as Arthur's Pike. Besides these, on the hill behind Shap, to\r\nthe eastward, are several stone circles, some single, some double,\r\nbut none are of any great size, or composed of stones of very large\r\ndimensions. The whole aspect of the country is that of a district used\r\nas a burying-place to an extent far beyond anything that the usual\r\ninhabitants of the locality could have required, for a bleaker and more\r\nungenial spot is not inhabited in any part of these islands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, no credible tradition attaches to these monuments\r\nso as to connect them with any historical or local incident. We\r\nare, therefore, left almost wholly to their intrinsic forms, or to\r\nanalogies, to determine either their history or their purposes.\r\n\r\nNo one will now probably be found seriously to maintain that the long\r\nstone row at Shap was a temple either of the Druids or of any one else.\r\nAt least if these ancient people thought a single or even a double\r\nrow of widely-spaced stones, stretching to a mile and a half across\r\na bleak moor, was a proper form for a place to worship in, they must\r\nhave been differently constituted from ourselves. Unless they possessed\r\nthe tails, or at least the long-pointed ears with which Darwin endows\r\nour ancestors, they would have adopted some form of temple more nearly\r\nsimilar to those used in all other countries of the world. Nor was it a\r\ntomb. Not only have no sepulchral remains been found here, but nowhere\r\nelse has any trace of such a purpose been found connected with such\r\nalignments. Even, however, if it is contended that it is sepulchral,\r\nit certainly was not the burying-place of the hamlet of Shap, or of\r\nits neighbourhood, for a more miserable spot for habitation does not\r\nexist in England, and it cannot be that Shap, like Avebury, should\r\nrequire the most magnificent cemeteries in the island, while nothing of\r\nthe sort exists near the great centres of population. Had the country\r\nbeen as thickly inhabited as China, we might fancy the people seeking\r\nwaste uncultivable spots in which to bury their dead, but even at the\r\npresent day Woking is the only cemetery that has been selected on this\r\nprinciple in England, and at any previous time to which we can look\r\nback, the idea appears too absurd to be entertained for a moment.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, the alignment at Shap was sepulchral, it must have\r\nbeen the burying-place of those that fell in some battle on the spot;\r\nthis in fact brings us to the only suggestion I am aware of that seems\r\nat all tenable: that it marks a battle-field like those on Dartmoor\r\n(_ante_, p. 54), and others we shall meet with hereafter.\r\n\r\nExcavations have proved that all the smaller circles which abound in\r\nthe neighbourhood are graves, and if those from 60 feet to 100 feet\r\nin diameter are so, all analogy must lead us to the inference that\r\nthe 100-metre circles are so also. Direct proof has not, however, yet\r\nbeen obtained of this, but that may arise first from the difficulty of\r\nexcavating so large an area; or it may be that the bodies were buried\r\noutside the circle, as at Hakpen (_ante_, p. 76), or at the foot of the\r\nstones, as at Crichie (_ante_, p. 75) or in those circles which have\r\nno erect stones in a similar position--at the toe of the inner slope\r\nof the rampart--and these are just the places where they have not been\r\nlooked for. Meanwhile the cairns in the inside of the circle of Long\r\nMeg's Daughters seem to favour this view of their sepulchral purpose.\r\nBut if sepulchres, certainly they were not family or princely tombs. If\r\nthat was their destination they would not be found only in two or three\r\ngroups in the wildest and most remote parts of the country, but in far\r\ngreater numbers, and nearer those places where men most do congregate.\r\nWe are in fact driven to Camden's suggestion, that they may have been\r\nmade to celebrate some victory; but, if so, what victory? It looks like\r\nriding a hobby very hard to make the same suggestion as was made with\r\nregard to Avebury, but I confess I know no other that can be brought\r\nforward with so much plausibility as that of considering them to be\r\nmemorials of Arthur's campaigns against the Saxon invaders.\r\n\r\nThe first objection that will naturally be raised to this hypothesis\r\nis, that King Arthur was a myth, and never fought any battles at all.\r\nIt was not necessary to examine this when speaking of Avebury. All that\r\nwas then required was to know if Waden Hill was Badon Hill. If it was\r\nthe site of that famous battle, there was no further enquiry necessary.\r\nArthur, and he only, commanded there; and if we admit the fact of the\r\nbattle being fought, we admit at the same time the existence of him who\r\ncommanded there. But with regard to the other eleven battles mentioned\r\nby Nennius[159] the case is not so clear, and according to the present\r\nfashionable school of historical criticism it is thought reasonable to\r\nreject the whole as a myth, because the evidence is not such as would\r\nstand examination in a court of law, and also because the story as it\r\nnow stands is so mixed up with incredible fables as to throw discredit\r\non the whole. It is very much easier to heap ridicule on the silly\r\nmiracles which Merlin is said by mediæval minstrels to have performed,\r\nand to laugh at the marvellous exploits of Arthur and the Knights of\r\nhis Round Table, than to attempt to glean the few facts which their\r\nwild poetry has left unobscured. But if any one will attempt the\r\nsame process with one of the many 'Lhystoires du noble et vaillant\r\nroy Alexandre le grand,' he will find exactly the same difficulties.\r\nAristotle and his master have been rendered quite as fabulous persons\r\nas Merlin and Arthur, and the miracles of the one and the feats of the\r\nother are equally marvellous. In Alexander's case we fortunately have\r\nArrian and Curtius, and others, who give us the truth with regard to\r\nhim; but Arthur had no contemporary history, and instead of living in\r\na highly civilized state that continued for ages after him, he was the\r\nlast brilliant light of his age and race, and after him all was gloom\r\nfor centuries. It was not till after a long eclipse that his name was\r\nseized upon in a poetical and an uncritical age as a peg for bards\r\nwhereupon to hang their wild imaginings.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place to examine so large a question. It will be\r\nsufficient to state what I believe to be the main facts. Those who\r\ndo not admit them need not read further. Arthur, it seems to me, was\r\nborn the prince of one of the smaller states in the West of England,\r\nprobably Cornwall, and after the death of Ambrosius, in or about the\r\nyear 508, took up the struggle the latter had carried on with varying\r\nsuccess against the hordes of Saxons and others who were gradually\r\npushing the Bryts out of England. My impression is, that even before\r\nthe Romans left, Jutes, Angles, and Danes had not only traded with,\r\nbut had settled, both on the Saxonicum littus of Kent, and on the\r\ncoast of Yorkshire, Northumberland, and the Lothians; and that during\r\nthe century that elapsed between the departure of the Romans and the\r\ntime of Arthur, they were gradually pushing the British population\r\nbehind the range of hills which extends from Carlisle to Derby and\r\nforms the back-bone of England. It was in the plains behind this range\r\nand further south that all Arthur's battles seem to have been fought.\r\nWith Cumberland, Wales, and Cornwall behind him, he was not only sure\r\nof support from the native population in his rear, but had a secure\r\nretreat in case of adverse fortune overtaking him. In all this range\r\nof country I do not know any spot so favourable strategically for\r\na defender of his country to take up as the high land about Shap,\r\nor the open country extending from thence to Salkeld. The ridges at\r\nShap protected his right against an enemy advancing by Lancaster, the\r\nCaledonian Forest and a very rugged country covered his left, and in\r\nfront there was only a wild inhospitable tract by which the invader\r\nfrom the opposite coast could advance against him, while by a single\r\nday's march to his rear he was among the inaccessible mountains and\r\nlakes of Cumberland.\r\n\r\nI am afraid to lay much stress on the fact of one of the circles at\r\nPenrith and the hill opposite Shap bearing Arthur's name, because in\r\nthe last few years we have seen two hard-headed sober-minded Scotchmen\r\nproving, to their own satisfaction, that Arthur was born north of the\r\nTweed--that all his battles were fought and all his exploits performed\r\nin the northern portion of the island. Even Ganora--the faithless\r\nGuinevere--if not a Scotchwoman, was at all events buried in Miegle\r\nchurchyard under a stone, which some pious descendant sculptured some\r\ncenturies later.[160] Even here, however, I fancy I can perceive\r\na difference between the two cases. In the middle ages the Scotch\r\nhad historians like Boece and Fordun, who recorded such fables for\r\nthe edification of their countrymen, and with proper patriotism\r\nwere willing that their country should have as large a share of the\r\nworld's greatness or great men as they could well appropriate. They\r\nwere followed by an educated class throughout the country, who were\r\nactuated by the same motives, and did exactly what Stukeley and his\r\nfollowers did with English monuments. They found Druids who had no\r\ntemples, and remains which they supposed to be temples with no priests;\r\nso, putting the two together, they made what they fancied was a perfect\r\nwhole out of two incongruous halves. So the Scotch, having a rich\r\nrepertory of fables on the one hand, and on the other having hills\r\nwithout names and sculptured stones without owners, joined the two\r\ntogether, and went on repeating in the same manner their inventions\r\ntill, from dire reiteration, they took the likeness of fact.\r\n\r\nThe case was, if I mistake not, very different in Cumberland. The boors\r\nof that land had no literature--no learning, and none of that ardent\r\npatriotism which enabled the Scotch poets and pedants to manufacture\r\na quasi history for themselves out of other people's doings. It is\r\ndifficult to fancy the inhabitants of Cumberland troubling themselves\r\nwith Arthur and his affairs, and wishing to apply his name to\r\ntheir hills or antiquities, unless some ancient tradition had made\r\nit probable, and, \"valeat quantum,\" these names may therefore be\r\nconsidered as suggesting a real connexion between the place and the man.\r\n\r\nOwing to the extreme brevity of the record in Nennius,[161] there are\r\nfew things about which greater discrepancy of opinion exists even among\r\nthe believers in Arthur than the localities of his battles. Taking\r\nthem in the order in which they are mentioned, the first is said to\r\nhave been fought on the river Glem of Glein, which the editors of the\r\n'Monumenta Historica Britannica' suggest may be a river of that name\r\nin Northumberland. The river indicated is so small a brook that it is\r\ndifficult to fancy its name should be attached to so important an event.\r\n\r\nIf we must go so far north, I would rather feel inclined to place it\r\nat Wood Castle, near Lochmaben, in Dumfriesshire, where there is a\r\ncircular enclosure identical in plan and dimensions with King Arthur's\r\nRound Table at Penrith.[162] Strategically, it is a much more likely\r\nspot than the exposed east coast of Northumberland; but, except\r\nthe plan of Wood Castle, I know of no authority for placing this\r\nbattle-field in Annandale.\r\n\r\nThere is no indication where the second, third, or fourth battles were\r\nfought; but for the fifth we have this important designation that it\r\nwas fought \"super aliud flumen quod vocatur Duglas vel Dubglas quod est\r\nin regione Linuis,\" or in another MS. Linnuis. A marginal note suggests\r\nLindesay, in Lincolnshire, but for no other reason apparently than from\r\nthe first three letters being the same in both. There is a River Duglas\r\nflowing past Wigan, in Lancashire, which Whittaker, in his 'History\r\nof Manchester,' boldly adopts as the place indicated, and others have\r\nbeen inclined to accept his determination. After going carefully over\r\nthe ground, I confess no spot appears to me more unlikely for a great\r\nbattle than the banks of this river, nor does any local evidence of\r\ntheir having been so now remain. One cannot but feel that if Arthur\r\never allowed himself to be pushed into such a corner, with nothing but\r\nthe sea behind him to retreat upon, he certainly was not the general\r\nthat made so successful a stand against the Saxons. I am much more\r\ninclined to believe that Linnuis is only a barbarous latinization of\r\nLinn, which in Gaelic and Irish means sea or lake. In Welsh it is Lyn,\r\nand in Anglo-Saxon Lin, and if this is so, \"In regione Linnuis\" may\r\nmean \"In the Lake Country.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of the river does not appear to me at all an insuperable\r\ndifficulty. All the rivers about Penrith, the Lowther, the Eamount,\r\nand the Eden, have names that were certainly given to them by the\r\nSaxons, but they must have had Celtic names before they came; and Dubh\r\nas an adjective is dark or black, and Glas, green or grey, is used\r\nas a substantive to denote the sea, in Irish. Such an epithet would\r\napply admirably to the Lowther; and if it could be identified with the\r\nriver mentioned by Nennius, our difficulties would be at an end. These\r\nspeculations, however, must of course be taken for what they are worth.\r\nThere is, so far as known, no authority for the name Duglas or Dubhglas\r\nbeing applied to the Lowther or Eden.\r\n\r\nThe sixth battle was on a river called Bassas. It has been suggested\r\nthat this means the Bass Rock in the Frith of Forth; but it need hardly\r\nbe objected that a rock is not a river, and there is an extreme\r\nimprobability that Arthur ever saw the Lothians. In Derbyshire there is\r\na Bas Lowe[163] in a neighbourhood where, as we shall presently see,\r\nthere is reason to believe Arthur fought one or more of his battles,\r\nbut I am not aware of any river so called in that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe seventh war was in Silva Calidonis, \"id est Cat Coit Celidon.\"\r\nThe Cat in the last name is evidently Cat or Cath, \"a battle,\" which\r\nwe frequently meet with, and shall again in describing these matters.\r\nCoit, only so far as the dictionaries tell us, means coracle, and would\r\nseem to indicate a struggle in boats. The Caledonian Forest, is what\r\nwill really determine the locality. Generally it is understood to be\r\nthe forest that extended from Penrith to Carlisle; and, if so, any one\r\nof our Penrith circles might be assumed to mark the site of the seventh\r\nbattle. Most probably in that case it would be the Salkeld circle, or\r\nit might be one known as the Grey Yawds, near Cumrew, about eight or\r\nnine miles further north.[164]\r\n\r\nThe eighth battle was in Castello Guinnion, or Guin, which, from the\r\nsound of the name, can hardly escape being in Wales or the Welsh\r\nborder, unless indeed we assume that these Welsh appellations were\r\ncommon to the whole country before the Saxons re-named many of the\r\nplaces. In that case we have nothing to guide us as to where the battle\r\nwas fought.\r\n\r\nThe ninth battle was \"in Urbe Legionis.\" This may be either Chester\r\nor Caerleon in South Wales. It most probably was the latter, as in\r\nanother MS. it is added \"quæ Britannice Karlium dicitur,\" or Cair lin\r\nin another.\r\n\r\nThe tenth war was on the shores of a river which was called Ribroit.\r\nThough this is spelt in various MSS. Tribruit, Trathreuroit, and\r\nTrattreuroit, it seems impossible to identify it. But it must have been\r\na large river, or the expression \"in littore\" would hardly have been\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh battle \"fuit in Monte quod dicitur Agned Cathregonnon;\"\r\nand in different MSS. this is spelt Cathregomion, Cabregonnon,\r\nCatbregonnion, and in one it is added, \"in Somersetshire quem nos\r\nCathbregion appellamus.\" No such name seems now to be known in that\r\ncountry; but as we shall presently, I hope, see reason for believing,\r\nthe spot is probably that now known as Stanton Drew.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth battle was that of Mount Badon, the position of which,\r\nas we have already pointed out, may almost certainly be fixed in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of Avebury.\r\n\r\nAll this is indistinct enough, it must be confessed, and much of it\r\ndepends on nominal similarities, which are never very satisfactory;\r\nstill the general impression it leaves seems worthy of acceptance. It\r\nwould lead us to think that Arthur commenced his struggles with the\r\ninvaders in the north of England, probably in the time of Ambrosius,\r\nand fought his way southwards, till after twelve campaigns, or twelve\r\nbattles, he reached his crowning victory at Badon Hill, which gave\r\nhim peace for the rest of his days. At all events, with respect to\r\nthe first seven battles, there seems no reason why we should not\r\nappropriate any of them except perhaps the first--to our Cumberland\r\ncircles. The proof of whether or not it is reasonable to do so will of\r\ncourse depend on the case we can make out for the other circles we have\r\nto examine, and on the general interdependence which the whole series\r\ncan be shown to have on one another.\r\n\r\nAt present it may be allowed to stand on an hypothesis, which certainly\r\nhas the merit of explaining the facts as now known; but the probability\r\nor disproof of which must depend on the facts and arguments to be\r\nadduced hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nDERBYSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe next group of monuments with which we have to deal is perhaps as\r\ninteresting as any of those hitherto described. As before mentioned,\r\nwhen speaking of the labours of William and Thomas Bateman, the\r\nnorth-western portion of the county is crowded with barrows, but none\r\napparently of so ancient a character as those excavated by Canon\r\nGreenwell in Yorkshire, and most of them containing objects of so\r\nmiscellaneous a character as to defy systematic classification. As\r\nthese, however, hardly belong to the subject of which we are now\r\ntreating, it is not necessary to say more about them at present; and\r\nthe less so, that the group which falls directly in with our line of\r\nresearch is well defined as to locality, and probably also as to age.\r\n\r\nThe principal monument of this group is well-known to antiquaries as\r\nArbe or Arbor Low,[165] and is situated about nine miles south by\r\neast from Buxton, and by a curious coincidence is placed in the same\r\nrelative position to the Roman Road as Avebury. So much is this the\r\ncase, that in the Ordnance Survey--barring the scale--the one might\r\nbe mistaken for the other if cut out from the neighbouring objects.\r\nMinning Low, however, which is the pendant of Silbury Hill in this\r\ngroup, is four miles off, though still in the line of the Roman road,\r\ninstead of only one mile, as in the Wiltshire example. Besides, there\r\nis a most interesting Saxon Low at Benty Grange, about one mile from\r\nArbor Low. Gib Hill, Kens Low, Ringham Low, End Low, Lean Low, and\r\nprobably altogether ten or twelve important mounds covering a space\r\nfive miles in one direction, by one and a half to two miles across.\r\n\r\nArbor Low consists of a circular platform, 167 feet in diameter,\r\nsurrounded by a ditch 18 feet broad at bottom, the earth taken from\r\nwhich has been used to form a rampart about 15 feet to 18 feet high,\r\nand measuring about 820 feet in circumference on the top.[166] The\r\nfirst thing that strikes us on looking at the plan (woodcut No. 30) is\r\nthat, in design and general dimensions, the monument is identical with\r\nthat called \"Arthur's Round Table,\" at Penrith. The one difference is\r\nthat, in this instance, the section of the ditch, and consequently that\r\nof the rampart, have been increased at the expense of the berm; but the\r\narrangements of both are the same, and so are the internal and external\r\ndimensions. At Arbor Low there are two entrances across the ditch, as\r\nthere was in the Cumberland and Dumfriesshire examples. As mentioned\r\nabove, only one is now visible there, the other having been obliterated\r\nby the road, but the two circles are in other respects so similar as to\r\nleave very little doubt as to their true features.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 30. Arbor Low. From a drawing by Sir Gardner Wilkinson.]\r\n\r\nThe Derbyshire example, however, possesses, in addition to its\r\nearthworks, a circle of stones on its inner platform, originally\r\nprobably forty or fifty in number; but all now prostrate, except\r\nperhaps some of the smallest, which, being nearly cubical, may still be\r\nin _situ_. In the centre of the platform, also, are several very large\r\nstones, which evidently formed part of a central dolmen.\r\n\r\nThere is another very interesting addition at Arbor Low, which is\r\nwanting at Penrith, this is a tumulus attached unsymmetrically to the\r\nouter vallum. This was, after repeated attempts, at last successfully\r\nexcavated by the Messrs. Bateman, and found to contain a cist of rather\r\nirregular shape, in which were found among other things two vases[167]\r\none of singularly elegant shape, the other less so. In themselves\r\nthese objects are not sufficient to determine the age of the barrow,\r\nbut they suffice to show that it was not very early. One great point\r\nof interest in this discovery is its position with reference to the\r\ncircle. It is identical with that of Long Meg with reference to her\r\ndaughters, and perhaps some of the stones outside Avebury, supposed to\r\nbe the commencement of the avenue, may mark the principal places of\r\ninterment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 31. Vases and Bronze Pin found in Arbor Low.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 32. Section of Gib Hill. No scale.]\r\n\r\nAttached to Arbor Low, at a distance of about 250 yards, is another\r\ntumulus, called Gib Hill, apparently about 70 to 80 feet in\r\ndiameter.[168] It was carefully excavated by Mr. T. Bateman in 1848;\r\nbut after tunnelling through and through it in every direction on\r\nthe ground level and finding nothing, he was surprised at finding,\r\non removing the timber which supported his galleries, that the side\r\nof the hill fell in, and disclosed the cist very near the summit.\r\nThe whole fell down, and the stones composing the cist were removed\r\nand re-erected in the garden of Lumberdale House. It consisted of\r\nfour massive blocks of limestone forming the sides of a chamber, 2\r\nfeet by 2 feet 6 inches, and covered by one 4 feet square. The cap\r\nstone was not more than 18 inches below the turf. By the sudden fall\r\nof the side a very pretty vase was crushed, the fragments mingling\r\nwith the burnt bones it contained; but though restored, unfortunately\r\nno representation has been given. The only other articles found in\r\nthis tumulus were \"a battered celt of basaltic stone, a dart or\r\njavelin-point of flint, and a small iron fibula, which had been\r\nenriched with precious stones.\"[169]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 33. Summit of Minning Low, as it appeared in 1786. From\r\nDouglas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 34. Plan of Chambers in Minning Low.]\r\n\r\nThough Gib Hill is interesting as the first of the high-level dolmens\r\nwhich we have met with in this country, Minning Low is a still more\r\nstriking example of that class which we hinted at before as common\r\nin Aveyron (_ante_, woodcut No. 8), and which we shall meet with\r\nfrequently as we proceed. When it first attracted the attention of\r\nantiquaries in 1786, Minning Low seems to have been a straight-lined\r\ntruncated cone, about 300 feet in diameter, and the platform on\r\nits summit measured 80 feet across.[170] Its height could not be\r\nascertained.[171] It was even then planted over with trees, so that\r\nthese dimensions, except the breadth of the platform, are hardly to\r\nbe depended upon, and since then the whole mound has been so dug\r\ninto and ruined, that they cannot now be verified. On the platform\r\nat the top in 1786 there stood live kistvaens, each capable of\r\ncontaining-one body; and, so far as can be made out from Douglas'\r\nplates and descriptions, the cap stone of these was flush with the\r\nsurface, or possibly, as at Gib Hill, they may have been a few inches\r\nbelow the surface, and, becoming exposed, may have been rifled as\r\nthey were found; but this is hardly probable, because unless always\r\nexposed, it is not likely they would have been either looked for in\r\nsuch a situation, or found by accident. Below them--at what depth we\r\nare not told--a stone chamber, or rather three chambers, were found by\r\nMr. Bateman, apparently on the level of the ground on the south side\r\nof the Barrow.[172] To use Mr. Bateman's own words ('Vestiges,' &c.,\r\np. 39): \"On the summit of Minning Low Hill, as they now appear from\r\nthe soil being removed from them, are two large cromlechs, exactly\r\nof the same construction as the well-known Kit's Cotty-house, near\r\nMaidstone, in Kent. In the cell near which the body lay were found\r\nfragments of five urns, some animal bones, and six brass Roman coins,\r\nviz., one of Claudius Gothicus (270), two of Constantine the Great, two\r\nof Constantine, junior, and one of Valentinian. There is a striking\r\nanalogy between this and the great Barrow at New Grange, described by\r\nDr. Ledwich, of which a more complete investigation of Minning Low\r\nwould probably furnish additional proofs.\" Mr. Bateman was not then\r\naware that a coin of Valentinian had been found in the New Grange\r\nmound,[173] which is one similarity in addition.\r\n\r\nThe fact of these coins being found here fixes a date beyond which\r\nit is impossible to carry back the age of this mound, but not the\r\ndate below which it may have been erected. The coins found in British\r\nbarrows seem almost always those of the last Emperors who held sway\r\nin Britain, and whose coins may have been preserved and to a certain\r\nextent kept in circulation after all direct connexion with Rome had\r\nceased, and thus their rarity or antiquity may have made them suitable\r\nfor sepulchral deposits. No coin of Augustus or any of the earlier\r\nEmperors was ever found in or on any of these rude tumuli, which must\r\ncertainly have been the case had any of them been pre-Roman. This mound\r\nis consequently certainly subsequent to the first half of the fourth\r\ncentury, and how much more modern it may be remains to be determined.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, if Mr. Bateman's suggestion that this monument is a\r\ncounterpart of Kit's Cotty-house is correct--and no one who is familiar\r\nwith the two monuments will probably dispute it--this at once removes\r\nany improbability from the argument that the last-named may be the\r\ngrave of Catigren. The one striking difference between the two is, that\r\nKit's Cotty-house is an external free-standing dolmen, while Minning\r\nLow is buried in a tumulus. This, according to the views adopted in\r\nthese pages, from the experience of other monuments, would lead to the\r\ninference that the Kentish example was the more modern of the two. It\r\nis not, however, worth while arguing that point here; for our present\r\npurpose it is sufficient to know that both are post-Roman, and probably\r\nnot far distant in date.\r\n\r\nAnother barrow belonging to this group is at Benty Grange, about a\r\nmile from Arbor Low, which, though of a different character, may be\r\nconnected with the others. One body only was buried in it, of which\r\nno trace, however, remained but the hair.[174] There was apparently\r\nlittle more than 2 feet of earth over it. The first thing found was a\r\nleather drinking-cup, ornamented in silver with stars and crosses. Two\r\ncircular enamels were also there, adorned with that interlacing pattern\r\nfound in the earliest Anglo-Saxon or Irish MSS. of the sixth or seventh\r\ncenturies, or it may be a little earlier; a helmet also was found,\r\nformed of iron bars, with bronze and silver ornaments, and surmounted\r\nby what Mr. Bateman assures us was a perfectly distinct representation\r\nof a hog. He then quotes from Beowulf several passages, in which the\r\npoet describes: \"The boar an ornament to the head, the helmet lofty\r\nin wars\" (l. 4299).... \"They seemed a boar's form to bear over their\r\ncheeks\" (l. 604).... \"At the pile was easy to be seen, the mail-shirt\r\ncovered with gore, the hog of gold, the boar hard as iron\" (l. 2213).\r\nAs Beowulf lived, as shown above, probably in the fifth century, the\r\npoem may be taken as describing perfectly the costume of the warriors\r\nof his day; and nothing could answer more completely his description\r\nthan the contents of this tomb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 35. Fragment of Drinking Cup from Benty Grange.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 36. Fragment of Helmet from Benty Grange.]\r\n\r\nIn Kenslow Barrow, between Minning Low and Arbor Low, were found a few\r\nimplements of flint and bone; but on clearing out the grave in the\r\nrock, which had been examined before in 1821, Mr. S. Bateman found some\r\nportions of the skeleton undisturbed, and with them a small neat bronze\r\ndagger, and a little above these an iron knife of the shape and size\r\nusually deposited in Anglo-Saxon interments.[175] Of course the theory\r\nof successive interments is called on to explain away these disturbing\r\nfacts; but there seems nothing here to justify any other inference than\r\nthat in this case all the deposits belonged to the same age. This,\r\ntherefore, may be added to the examples quoted from the 'Vestiges,' to\r\nshow how little the Danish system is really applicable to the class of\r\nmonuments of which we are treating.\r\n\r\nOn Stanton Moor, four miles east from Kenslow, and about five miles\r\nfrom Arbor Low and Minning Low respectively, there are many monuments,\r\nboth of earth and stone, which, though on a smaller scale, seem to\r\nbelong to the same age as those just described. They seem to have been\r\nvery much overlooked by the Batemans, but a very detailed account of\r\nthem is given by Mr. Rooke in the sixth volume of the 'Archæologia,'\r\nin 1780. One of them, called the Nine Ladies, has been given already\r\n(_ante_, p. 49); but westward of it stands or stood a stone, called the\r\nKing Stone, at a distance of 34 yards, thus suggesting a similarity to\r\nthe Salkeld circle. Half a mile west from this, nearer Arbor Low, is\r\nanother group of nine stones, the tallest 17 feet in height, and 75\r\nyards southward two stones of smaller dimensions; 200 yards from this\r\nan oval ring, the major axis of which measures 243 feet, the minor 156\r\nfeet. It has what Mr. Rooke calls a double ditch, a rampart outside the\r\nditch as well as one inside; it is, in fact, a less-developed example\r\nof that form of which Arbor Low and Arthur's Round Table are finished\r\nexamples. On the east side of the Moor were three tall isolated stones,\r\nwhich in Rooke's time the natives still called Cat Stones, showing\r\nclearly that the tradition still remained of a battle fought there, but\r\nwhen or by whom no tradition lingers on the spot to enlighten us.\r\n\r\nAll these monuments and many more which it would be tedious and\r\nuninteresting to particularize, are contained within a circle, which\r\nmay be described with a radius of about three miles, the centre being\r\nhalf way between Henty Grange and Stanton Moor. It would perhaps be too\r\nmuch to assert that they are all of one age; but there is certainly a\r\nvery strong family likeness among them, and they cannot differ much\r\neither in age or purpose. It may also perhaps be conceded that they\r\nare not the tombs or temples of the inhabitants of the moors on which\r\nthey stand. The country where they are situated is a bleak inhospitable\r\ntract, only not quite so bad as Shap, but hardly more able to support\r\na large population, if left only to their own resources, than the\r\nWiltshire Downs. These three localities could never consequently have\r\nbeen so much richer in this class of monuments than settlements in the\r\nmore fertile parts of the island. Strangers must have erected them, and\r\nto determine who these strangers were, is the task to which antiquaries\r\nhave now to apply themselves.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be determined on the point, one thing, I think, must and\r\nwill be conceded, which is, that Arthur's Table at Penrith, Arbor Low,\r\nand Avebury, are monuments of the same age, and were dedicated to the\r\nsame purposes. The first is a simple earthen monument, of a certain\r\ndesign and with certain dimensions; the second has the same design and\r\ndimensions, with the addition of a circle of stones and dolmen in the\r\ncentre; the third has all the features that the other two possess, with\r\nthe addition of increased dimensions, and the internal circles being\r\ndoubled. But the internal ditch, the rampart, and the character of the\r\ncircle and other features, are so like each other, and so unlike what\r\nare found elsewhere, that they must stand or fall together. If any one\r\nof these belonged to the age of Arthur, all three certainly did. If, on\r\nthe other hand, any one of the three can be proved to belong to another\r\nage, the other two will hardly be able to maintain their position. The\r\ncircles at Cumrew, Salkeld, and Mayborough, present so many points\r\nof similarity, that they, too, must probably be classed with these\r\nthree, though there is not the same evidence to justify their being\r\nclassed together. The stone avenue at Shap is also most probably the\r\ncounterpart of that at Kennet; but the destruction of the circle at\r\nBrackenbyr, and the limited knowledge we have of it, prevent anything\r\nvery definite being predicated regarding it.\r\n\r\nIf we may consider Gib Hill as the analogue of Silbury Hill, its place\r\nand position may throw some light on the mystery attaching to the\r\nlatter. The relative distances of these satellites to their primaries\r\nis nearly proportional to the diameter of the circles, and they both\r\npresent the peculiarity that they have no interment in their base.\r\nThe Archæological Institute in 1849 did exactly what the Batemans had\r\ndone before them. They tunnelled and explored the base of Gib Hill,\r\nand gave it up in despair, when an accident revealed to them the grave\r\nover their heads, within 18 inches of the surface. The antiquaries were\r\nnot so fortunate at Silbury; but judging from the analogy of Gib Hill,\r\nand still more from that of Minning Low, the graves may be expected\r\nto be found arranged around the plateau on the summit, probably six\r\nor seven in number, and as probably within a few feet of the surface.\r\nThere was none in the centre of the platform at Minning Low, though\r\nthere was in the smaller tumulus of Gib Hill; and this may account for\r\nthe Duke of Northumberland's ill-success when he dug into the hill\r\nin 1776. Poor Stukeley was very much laughed at for prizing a very\r\nmodern-looking iron bit, belonging to a bridle that was found on the\r\ntop of the hill[176] (woodcut No. 18); yet it may turn out to be the\r\nonly real fact he brought away from the place. Nothing but an iron\r\nsword was found in the kistvaen, on the top of Minning Low, but it was\r\nnearly perfect;[177] why should not the bridle be found, for we know\r\nthat horses were frequently buried with the warriors they had borne in\r\nbattle?\r\n\r\nOmitting Cornwall for the present, the circles at Stanton Drew form the\r\nonly other group of any importance in England for which it remains to\r\nfind a purpose and a name; and I confess I see no reason for separating\r\nthem from those just named. There are so many points of similarity,\r\nthat they can hardly be of an age far apart, and their purpose\r\ncertainly is the same. If there is anything in the arguments adduced\r\nabove, they must mark a battle-field. They are certainly not a family\r\nor a princely sepulchre, still less a local cemetery, nor need it now\r\nbe added, certainly not a temple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 37. Circles at Stanton Drew. From a plan by Sir R. C.\r\nHoare.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 38. View of the Circles at Stanton Drew. From a sketch\r\nby Percy Shelton, Esq.]\r\n\r\nTheir arrangement will be understood from the annexed woodcut (No.\r\n37). The group consists of one first-class circle or oval, 378 feet\r\n(?) by 345 feet--100 metres; and two of the second class, one 96 feet,\r\nthe other 129; and a dolmen near the church, at a distance of 157\r\nyards from the last-named.[178] Attached to the two principal circles\r\nare short straight avenues, pointing apparently to two stones very\r\nnear to one another--the one at a distance of 300 feet from the large\r\ncircle, the other at the distance of about 100 from the smaller one,\r\nor at distances relative to their diameters. There is also a very\r\nlarge stone, called the King Stone, by the roadside, but beyond the\r\nlimits of the plan. This, with the stones to which the avenues point,\r\nare probably the analogues of the detached stone, known as Long Meg,\r\nat Salkeld, or the Ring Stone, which stands 180 feet from one of the\r\ncircles at Avebury; perhaps also of the two which are assumed to be the\r\ncommencement of the Beckhampton avenue at that place, or of the Friar's\r\nheel at Stonehenge, or of the King Stone at Stanton Moor. In fact, all\r\nthese circles seem to have detached stones standing at some little\r\ndistance from them outside. It is there that I would look for the\r\nprincipal interments, rather than in the circles themselves; but this\r\nis one of the questions that the spade, and the spade only, can decide.\r\nThere is, however, also attached to the smaller of the two circles\r\nat Stanton Drew a heap of stones which is apparently the ruins of a\r\ndolmen, and these may mark the real place of interment, as does the\r\ntumulus attached to Arbor Low, which corresponds with them in position.\r\n\r\nThe only recorded tradition with regard to this monument at Stanton\r\nDrew represents Keyna, a holy virgin in the fifth century, the daughter\r\napparently of a Welsh prince, obtaining a grant of the land on which\r\nthe village of Keynsham now stands from the prince of the country. She\r\nwas warned, however, of the insecurity of the gift, in consequence of\r\nthe serpents of a deadly species that infested the place. She accepted\r\nthe gift notwithstanding, and by her prayers converted the serpents\r\ninto the stones we now see there,[179] so at least Stukeley and\r\nBathurst Dean assure us.\r\n\r\nSuch a tradition is only valuable as indicating the date that is\r\npopularly ascribed to the monument. In this instance the fifth century\r\nis suggested, which may be 50 or even 100 years earlier than I would\r\nbe inclined to assign it to, but such data are of little consequence.\r\nThe date is also shadowed forth in the incident related; for not\r\nonly in Ireland, but in France, and frequently also in England, the\r\nearly struggles of the first Christian missionaries are represented\r\nas victories over the snakes or snake worshippers. St. Hilda, for\r\ninstance, at Whitby signalized the establishment of Christianity in\r\nthe seventh century by converting the Yorkshire snakes into Ammonites,\r\nwhich are still found there in quantities, which in the eyes of the\r\npeasantry are much more like stone snakes than the stones into which\r\nSt. Keyna transformed her Somersetshire enemies.\r\n\r\nWhatever the value of these and such like traditions, one thing seems\r\nquite certain, that every local tradition which has yet been quoted\r\nrepresents these monuments as erected subsequently to Roman times,\r\nand generally as belonging to that transitional age when Christianity\r\nwas struggling with Paganism for the mastery. The common people are\r\ngenerally willing enough to amuse themselves with fables about giants\r\nand demigods, and to wander back into prehistoric times; but with\r\nregard to these monuments they do not seem to have done so. I do not\r\nrecollect a single tradition that ascribes any stone circle to the\r\npre-Roman period.\r\n\r\nIf, however, I am correct in assuming that these great groups of\r\ncircles belong to the Arthurian age, we have no difficulty in assigning\r\nto this one its proper place in the series of his battles. The ninth,\r\nas we have seen above, was probably fought at Caerleon on the Usk;\r\nwhich would seem to indicate that, at a certain point in his career,\r\nArthur was forced back quite out of England into South Wales; but\r\nhis return on that hypothesis is easily traced. The tenth battle was\r\non the shore of some large river, which ought in consequence to be\r\nthe Severn, though the name given in the text lends no countenance\r\nto this supposition; the eleventh was \"In monte quod dicitur Agned\r\nin Somersetshire,\" which would answer perfectly, except in name; for\r\nStanton Drew, in that case, would be in the direct line of advance to\r\nBadon Hill, where the twelfth and crowning victory was fought.\r\n\r\nThe name here, as throughout, creates the difficulty, but Stanton on\r\nthe Stones, or Stone Town, is simply an epithet applied to all these\r\ngroups by the Saxons at some period subsequent to that of which we are\r\nspeaking, when the memory of their purpose was lost, or little cared\r\nfor by those of a different race, and speaking a different language,\r\nwho had succeeded to the Bryts, who had erected them. Unless we assume\r\nthat Stonehenge, Stanton Drew, the circles on Stanton Moor, and the\r\nstones at Stennis, and others, were erected by the Saxons themselves,\r\nthey must originally have borne Celtic names, and it would be these\r\nnames that Nennius would quote, and which consequently could not be\r\nthose by which they are now known.\r\n\r\nThe expression \"in monte\" is singularly confirmatory of this\r\ndetermination, inasmuch as one of the remarkable features of the\r\nlocality is the fortified hill known as Maes[180] Knoll, which\r\nliterally looks into Stanton Drew, and is the most remarkable feature\r\nseen from it, and a fight on its ridge is as probable an operation as\r\nany likely to be undertaken in this quarter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the above were all the evidence that could be produced in support\r\nof the hypothesis that all these great circles belonged to the\r\nArthurian age, it might be admitted to be sufficient to establish not a\r\nconclusion but a fair _prima facie_ case. The reasonableness, however,\r\nof what has been here advanced will, it is hoped, become more and more\r\napparent as we proceed. Absolute mathematical or logical proof it is to\r\nbe feared, in the present state of the evidence, is not available. Till\r\nattention is fairly turned to a certain definite line of argument, the\r\nexperiments are not made, and the authorities are not read, which bear\r\nupon it, or if made or read are not understood; but when the arguments\r\nare examined with the earnest desire to prove or disprove them, new\r\nlight springs up from every quarter, and before long there may be\r\ngrounds for a positive answer.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile it may be well to point out, before going further, that this\r\nclass of circles is peculiar to England. They do not exist in France\r\nor in Algeria. The Scandinavian circles are all very different, so too\r\nare the Irish. The one circle out of England that at all resembles them\r\nis that at Stennis, or rather Brogar, in the Orkneys, which will be\r\ndescribed in detail further on. There we have a great 100-metre circle,\r\nwith a ditch (but no rampart), a smaller 100-foot circle, with a ruined\r\ndolmen in its stone circle, as at Stanton Drew, and we have the Maes\r\nKnoll for the Maes How. The Stennis group has also the detached stones,\r\nthough it wants the rudimentary avenues, and some minor peculiarities,\r\nand it may be more modern, but it is very similar; whereas those in\r\nCornwall and elsewhere are small and irregular, and totally wanting\r\nin the dignity belonging to those which we have ventured to call\r\nArthurian.\r\n\r\nThe arguments adduced in the preceding pages will probably be deemed\r\nsufficient to make out a strong case to show that these great circles\r\nwere erected, at all events, after the departure of the Romans, and if\r\nthis is so, it confines the field for discussion within very narrow\r\nlimits. Either they must have been erected by the Romanized Britons\r\nbefore they were so completely Christianized as to be entirely weaned\r\nfrom their Pagan habits, or they were the works of the Saxons or\r\nDanes. We shall be in a better position to judge how far it is likely\r\nthat the latter were the authors, when we have examined the rude\r\nstone monuments of Scandinavia or Friesland, from which countries\r\nthe Northmen descended on our shores. When this is done, we shall\r\nprobably come to the conclusion that, as they erected Dolmens as\r\nburying-places for their dead, and Menhirs or Bauta Stones and circles\r\nin their battle-fields, there is no improbability of their having done\r\nso also here. The question, however, is, did they erect these great\r\n100-metre circles? These are unique, so far as I know; a class quite by\r\nthemselves, and so similar, whether found in Cumberland or Derbyshire,\r\nor in Wilts or Somersetshire, that, with the probable exception of the\r\nOrkney group, they must be the work of one people, and also nearly of\r\nthe same age. If, in fact, they do not mark the battle-fields to which\r\nI have attempted to ascribe them, they must mark something nearly\r\napproximating to them in date, and as nearly analogous in intention and\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALLER CIRCLES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 39. Rose Hill Tumulus. From the 'Archæologia,' vol. x.]\r\n\r\nIt would be as tedious as unprofitable to attempt to enumerate all\r\nthe smaller circles existing in various parts of England; but there\r\nare two or three which are curious in themselves, and interesting as\r\nillustrating the large circles of which we have just been treating.\r\nThe first to be mentioned is one situated in Englewood Forest, near\r\nRose Hill, and therefore nearly equidistant from Cumrew, Salkeld, and\r\nCarlisle. Locally, therefore, it belongs to the Cumberland group,\r\ndescribed above, and may do so in date also. It is a low platform,\r\nit can hardly be called a tumulus, as it is only 12 feet high. It is\r\ncircular, and measures 63 feet across. On the platform stand, or at\r\nleast stood in 1787, three bilithons, or groups of two tall stones\r\nstanding side by side, like those in the inner circle at Stonehenge.\r\nMr. Rooke dug in front of one of these, with the intention of seeing\r\nhow deep it was in the ground, but to his astonishment he found a cist\r\nformed of six perfectly well fitted hewn stones, but measuring little\r\nmore than 2 feet each way. In front of the other outside group he\r\nfound a similar cist, but a little larger, 2 feet 10 inches by 2 feet\r\n2 inches, and further removed from the central pair of upright stones,\r\nand nearer the centre of the circle, a third cist, formed equally of\r\nhewn and well fitted stones. In all three of these were found human\r\nbones, fragments of skulls, teeth, &c., but no implements or ornaments\r\nof any sort, only under one head a metallic lump, with apparently\r\nparticles of gold in it.[181] This was sent to the Society of\r\nAntiquaries for examination, but with what result is not stated.[182]\r\nAccording to the plan, it would appear as if there were originally six\r\ninterments in the mound. In fact, that it was the counterpart of the\r\ntop of Minning Low, with the addition of the pairs of obelisks. Mr.\r\nRooke was, however, so much puzzled at finding Druids buried six feet\r\nbelow the floor of their own temple, that he did not seek further.\r\nBut if the mound still exists, it would be very interesting to know\r\nif any more cists exist in the mound, or any burial deeper down below\r\nthem, as in the Derbyshire example. It might contain coins, and if so,\r\nwould be interesting as another example of its date; but meanwhile its\r\ntruncated conoidal form and arrangement of graves, and of trilithons,\r\nare sufficient to show that it was cotemporary with Minning Low and\r\nStonehenge, or at all events not far from their date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 40. Snaffle-Bit found at Aspatria.]\r\n\r\nIn the same paper in which Mr. Rooke describes the Rose Hill tumulus\r\nhe gives an account of an excavation at a place called Aspatria, a\r\nlittle farther westward, and near St. Bees. They cleared away a barrow\r\nabout 90 feet in diameter, and at 3 feet below the original surface\r\nof the ground found a cist in which lay the skeleton of a man of\r\ngigantic stature. As he lay extended, he measured 7 feet from the head\r\nto the ankle. His feet were decayed and rotted off. At his side, near\r\nthe shoulder-blade, was an iron sword 4 feet in length, the handle\r\nelegantly ornamented with inlaid silver flowers; a gold fibula or\r\nbuckle was also found, with portions of the shield and his battle-axe.\r\nOne of the most curious things found was the bit of a snaffle-bridle,\r\nwhich is so modern-looking that it would not excite interest if seen\r\non a stall in Seven Dials. The main interest resides in its similarity\r\nto that which Stukeley found at Silbury Hill (woodcut No. 18, p.\r\n81). He cleaned and polished his one carefully. Mr. Rooke had his\r\nengraved with all the rust upon it, so, at first sight, they are not so\r\nsimilar as they are in reality. The fact of this one being found in an\r\nundoubtedly ancient grave, takes away all _prima facie_ improbability\r\nfrom the suggested age of the other. From its form, Stukeley's appears\r\nto be the older of the two; but we have no chronometric scale for\r\nbridle-bits.\r\n\r\nAll these things make this grave look as if it were very modern; but on\r\nthe outside of the stones forming the cist were engraved a variety of\r\nfigures which are of interest as a means of comparison with the Irish\r\nand Danish engravings we shall meet with hereafter. They are not very\r\nartistically drawn, and are probably worse engraved; but it is easy to\r\nrecognize the cross in the circle. There are the concentric circles\r\nwith dots in the centre and straight lines proceeding from them and\r\nother figures found on rocks and elsewhere, which antiquaries have\r\nhitherto been inclined to ascribe to a primæval antiquity, but which\r\nthis tomb would bring down at least to the Viking age--of which more\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 41. Side Stone, Aspatria Cist.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 42. Mule Hill, View of Cists.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 43. Circle of Cists at Mule Hill, Isle of Man.]\r\n\r\nThe circle of cists on Mule Hill, in the Isle of Man, are interesting\r\nfrom another cause; for unfortunately they all have been laid bare\r\nand rifled before any antiquary took cognisance of them, and we have\r\nconsequently nothing by which their date can be even guessed at. Their\r\ninterest lies in their arrangement, which is that of eight cists\r\narranged in a circle, with, it would seem, others at right angles at\r\ncertain intervals.[183] From simple inspection it is evident that\r\nthese cists must at one time have been covered with earth. They are\r\nnot dolmens, or anything that would do for self-standing monuments.\r\nIf covered with earth, they would form a circular mound 45 feet in\r\ndiameter internally, and 65 feet across to the foot of the outer\r\nslope, and, as far as one example can go, would tend to prove that the\r\ncircular vallum at Avebury and many other places was a place for the\r\ndeposit of bodies. Except in the instance spoken of in describing the\r\ncircle at Marden, I am not aware of bodies having been found in England\r\nunder these ramparts; but they have not been sought for. Of one thing\r\nwe may feel certain, that nothing is unique in these matters, and that\r\nwhat occurred once, occurred frequently, and will no doubt be found\r\nwhen looked for.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of this circle is worth observing. There are two\r\ngaps or openings in the circle opposite one another, as at Arbor\r\nLow and Penrith. One must not rely too much on this, as the gaps\r\nhere may arise from the removal of cists; but the coincidence is at\r\nleast curious, and if we restored this monument in the sense just\r\nindicated, and could rely on that restoration, the secret of the\r\nvallum surrounding Avebury and other similar monuments would no longer\r\nbe a mystery. To my mind it has not been so for many years past; but\r\nthough I dare not yet ask others to follow at once, I trust sufficient\r\nevidence has been accumulated in the preceding pages to render it\r\nprobable that they were only continuous tumuli.\r\n\r\nThe circle or rather circles, on Burn Moor, near Wast Water,\r\nCumberland, are described by Mr. Williams as consisting of a 100-foot\r\ncircle, formed of forty-four stones, beyond which, at a distance of 25\r\nfeet is an outer circle of fourteen large stones. A niche or square\r\nenclosure on one side of the inner circle contains a cairn 25 feet in\r\ndiameter, and within the circle are four others, irregularly spaced,\r\nand measuring 21 to 25 feet in diameter; each like the circle itself,\r\nsurrounded by fourteen stones. These, on being opened, were found to\r\ncontain a rude chamber formed of five stones, in which were found\r\nremains of burnt bones, horns of stags, and other animals.[184]\r\n\r\nOne point of interest in this monument is, that it explains the\r\nexistence of a similar square enclosure on one side of a well-known\r\n100-foot circle near Keswick. There is no sign of a cairn there now;\r\nit may have been removed, as those at Salkeld were, or it may be that\r\nthe body was interred without this external indication; but that it\r\nlies, or lay, in this enclosure seems certain. The principal reason\r\nfor referring to it here is that it is undoubtedly sepulchral. We\r\nshall find many examples equally so further on, but it is well, in the\r\nmeanwhile, to illustrate one which certainly was neither a temple nor\r\nplace of assembly, and which contains, besides, several peculiarities\r\nto which we shall have occasion to advert hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 44. Circles on Burn Moor, Cumberland.]\r\n\r\nIt seems almost equally clear that the Boscawen circles, with which\r\nwe close our illustrations of English circles for the present, were\r\nneither Temples nor Things. It is very difficult to see how any one\r\ncould fancy that anything so confused as the centre of these circles\r\nis, could be a temple, still less a place of assembly. But Borlase,\r\nthough generally admitting the sepulchral nature of the circles,\r\nmaintains that this one was a temple, and describes the position\r\nof the serving Druids and all the ceremonies down to the minutest\r\nparticulars. The circles are small, the largest being only 75 feet in\r\ndiameter, and the whole group only 200 feet across, neither are the\r\nstones by any means of imposing dimensions. Another circumstance worthy\r\nof being noticed, is that there are detached stones in front of the\r\nprincipal circles. Interesting results might be obtained by excavating\r\nat their bases, as, for reasons above stated, it seems as if the\r\nprincipal interment might be found at their feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 45. Boscawen Circles. From Borlase.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOLMENS.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, England seems to be the native country of the great\r\ncircles, no 100-metre circles having yet been found anywhere out\r\nof England, excepting, of course, that at Stennis. France, on the\r\ncontrary, seems to be the native country of the dolmens. They exist\r\nthere in numbers far beyond anything we can show, and of dimensions\r\nexceeding anything we can boast of. In England proper, when we\r\nhave enumerated Kit's Cotty-house, the dolmen in Clatford Bottom,\r\nWayland Smith's Cave, that at Rollright, and one at Drewsteignton, in\r\nDevonshire, our list is nearly exhausted. There may be heaps of stones\r\nwhich seem dolmens, or something like them; and chambered tumuli, whose\r\ninternal kistvaens, if exposed, might be entitled to rank with dolmens;\r\nbut, taking the word in its broad sense, it is difficult to carry our\r\nlist beyond the half-dozen.\r\n\r\nIn Cornwall the case is different. In the corner to the westward\r\nof Falmouth there are at least twice as many as in all England. In\r\nWales, I think I could enumerate twice as many as in Cornwall; and\r\nin Anglesea[185] there are certainly as many as in Cornwall, perhaps\r\nmore; and in the Isle of Man they are also numerous. It is difficult\r\nto be precise, as the same monument is, sometimes at least, recorded\r\nunder two names; but it is not an exaggeration to say that from fifty\r\nto sixty have been described, and most of them figured, as found in\r\nthe West country, and I should not be surprised if an industrious\r\nstatistician carried the number to 100, including, of course, many that\r\nare now ruinous.\r\n\r\nThere are two points of view from which this geographical distribution\r\nof English dolmens may be regarded. The first and most obvious would\r\nbe to consider that they were erected by the Britons after they were\r\ndriven into the mountain fastnesses of the West, first by the Romans,\r\nand more completely afterwards by the Saxons. The other view would\r\nbe that they are the work of a different race, who, we have every\r\nreason to believe, occupied the western country in the time of the\r\nRomans. Tacitus is particularly explicit on this point. He divides\r\nthe inhabitants of the country into three classes. The red-haired\r\nCaledonians, resembling the Germans and inhabiting the north; the\r\nSilures, of dark complexion and curling hair, and whom he describes\r\nas living in that part of the country which is opposite Spain, and\r\nhe suggests that the ancient Iberians crossed over and occupied\r\nthese regions; and he then adds: \"Those nearest to Gaul are similar\r\nto the inhabitants of that country.\"[186] There is so much in the\r\npresent aspect of the people of this country to confirm this general\r\nclassification that there seems very little reason for doubting its\r\ngeneral correctness; and as all these dolmens are found in the country\r\nof the Silures it may be argued that they belong to them. If he had\r\njoined the Aquitanians to Iberians he would probably have expressed\r\nmore completely the whole facts of the case as we now know them.\r\n\r\nAdmitting, however, this ethnographic view of the case to the fullest\r\npossible extent--which I am prepared to do, it still leaves the\r\nquestion of date wholly unsettled. It would be answered if we dared\r\nto assume that the Silures were driven from the fertile parts of the\r\nvalley of the Severn, which we have reason to suppose they occupied\r\nin Agricola's time, to the mountain fastnesses, and that it was then\r\nonly that they began to repeat in stone what previously they had only\r\nerected in earth. If this could be established, we should get both an\r\nethnographical and a chronological determination of no small value; but\r\nof this we shall be better able to form an opinion after discussing the\r\nmonuments of France.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there is one point bearing upon the subject to which it may\r\nbe as well to draw attention. In Wales and Anglesea, which we may\r\nassume to have been the country of the Silures or that to which they\r\nwere driven, there are no circles, but only dolmens. In Cornwall, where\r\nthe blood was certainly more mixed, there are both circles and dolmens,\r\nand the same is the case at the other extremity of the western district\r\nin the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\nIf it is contended that, being nearer to Spain or Aquitaine than Wales,\r\nCornwall must have been earliest and most exclusively inhabited by\r\nthe dark race, the answer is, that though it may originally have been\r\nso, the races in Cornwall had been mixed with Celtic and other blood\r\nbefore the age of the stone monuments; while in the Isle of Man we\r\nshall probably see reason for believing that northern blood was infused\r\ninto the veins of the people, at a very early age, when few, if any,\r\nmonuments of this class existed, and certainly before all had been\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 46. Park Cwn Tumulus. Scale 16 feet to 1 inch.]\r\n\r\nEven a cursory examination of these West Coast dolmens would, I think,\r\nbe sufficient to prove to any one that the theory that all were\r\noriginally covered with earthen mounds is utterly untenable. That such\r\nchambered graves as those at Uley in Gloucestershire,[187] or Stoney\r\nLittleton in Somersetshire,[188] were always intended to be so covered\r\nup is clear enough. So was this one at Park Cwn, in the peninsula of\r\nGower, recently opened and described by Sir John Lubbock.[189] It\r\nis of the same type as Uley and Stoney Littleton, but has only four\r\nchambers arranged on each side of the central passage. One of its most\r\nremarkable characteristics is the beautiful masonry of the retaining\r\nwalls on each side of the funnel-shaped passage leading to the cells.\r\nThese are so carefully built that it is evident that they were meant\r\nto be seen, and the entrance to be kept open. Indeed, unless we fancy\r\nit was the monument of some fight, which there seems no reason for\r\nsupposing, it is evident it must have been kept open till forty\r\ndeaths had occurred in the family of the chief to which it served\r\nas sepulchre, as at least that number of bodies were found in the\r\nchambers, but in a dreadfully confused condition, as if the grave had\r\nbeen rifled before, but no implements or trace of metal were left to\r\nindicate even approximately its age.\r\n\r\nAt Uley, in Gloucestershire, half way between Berkeley and Tetbury,\r\nthere is a tumulus which, in its internal arrangement, is very similar\r\nto that last described. The entrance is of the same form, and there are\r\nfour side-chambers; but those at Uley are grouped more artistically\r\nin the centre, instead of being separated by a passage, as at Park\r\nCwn. Externally the differences are more apparent; the Gloucestershire\r\nexample being oblong, or rather heart-shaped, while that in Gower is\r\nmore circular in form. The Uley tumulus was first opened by a Mr.\r\nBaker, in 1821, but subsequently examined with great care by Dr.\r\nThurnam; and a very careful account, resulting from his own observation\r\ncompared with the records of Mr. Baker's, published by him in the\r\n'Archæological Journal.'[190] The bodies in the chambers, which were\r\nnumerous, had been disturbed and were lying in disorder, as at Park\r\nCwn; but among them was found a vessel resembling a Roman lachrymatory,\r\nand some pottery which may have been either Romano-British or Mediæval.\r\nThere were also found some fragments of flint implements, apparently\r\narrow-heads, and outside two stone axes--one of flint. Near the summit\r\nof the mound, exactly over the easternmost chamber, there had been\r\nanother interment, and beside the skeleton were found three brass coins\r\nof the sons of Constantine the Great.\r\n\r\nOn this evidence, Dr. Thurnam, with the approval probably of every\r\nantiquary in England, comes to the conclusion that the original\r\nerection of the chambered tumulus belongs to the long prehistoric past;\r\nthat the pottery, &c., were accidentally introduced; and that the coins\r\nbelong to a secondary post-Roman interment. The only evidence for this\r\nbeing the presence of the flints above mentioned, and the assumptions\r\nbased on them; they having become articles of faith with antiquaries\r\nwhich it is rank heresy to dispute. As I have already stated, till\r\nsome one can show at what period flint ceased to be used in any\r\nparticular locality, this evidence is worthless. With regard to the\r\nsecondary interments, it appears to be inconceivable that, after the\r\nlapse of 500 or 600 years at least, and the civilizing influence of the\r\nRoman occupation, any one should choose the top of one of the mounds\r\nof the long-forgotten pagan savages for a burying-place. If burying\r\nin barrows had been the fashion in Gloucestershire, as it was on the\r\nwolds of Yorkshire or the downs of Wiltshire, something might be said\r\nin favour of such an hypothesis if we could also assume that the races\r\nhad been undisturbed in the interval. But there are hardly half-a-dozen\r\ntumuli in the whole county. They, like Uley, Rodmarton,[191] Stoney\r\nLittleton,[192] are all chambered tumuli of one class and apparently of\r\none age. All too, it may be remarked, are close to Roman stations and\r\nsurrounded by evidences of Roman occupation.\r\n\r\nIn the previous pages we have already met with several instances\r\nof summit interments, as at Gib Hill, Minning Low, &c., which are\r\ncertainly not secondary, and we have reason to suspect that more will\r\nbe found when looked for; and the finding of Roman coins on or near\r\nthe top of tumuli is too frequent to be accidental, and occurs even in\r\nIreland, where the Romans never went.\r\n\r\nWe shall have occasion to recur to this subject when speaking of the\r\ntomb of King Harald Hildetand at Lethra, and then propose to treat\r\nit more in detail; but meanwhile it seems clear that the evidence of\r\nthe coins and the pottery must be allowed to outweigh that of the\r\nflints; and if this is so, not only Uley but all the chamber-tumuli in\r\nGloucestershire or Somerset belong either to the Romano-British, or\r\nrather to the post-Roman period of British history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 47. Tumulus, Plas Newydd.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 48. Entrance to Dolmen, in Tumulus, Plas Newydd.]\r\n\r\nAnother and even more interesting example of this class has recently\r\nbeen brought to light by the Hon. W. O. Stanley, at Plas Newydd, not\r\nfar from the great dolmen represented on woodcut No. 50.[193] It is\r\na chamber or cist, 3 feet 3 inches wide by about 7 feet long, and\r\ncovered by two slabs. Before being disturbed, the supporting slabs\r\nmust have formed nearly perfect walls, thus distinguishing the cist\r\nfrom those standing on widely-spaced legs. Its principal point of\r\ninterest, however, is the widely-splayed avenue of stones leading up to\r\nit, showing that it was always intended to be visited; and still more\r\ncurious are the two holes that were pierced in the slab that closed\r\nthe entrance. The upper part of this slab is now broken off, but so\r\nmuch remains that it is easy to see that they were originally circular\r\nand about 10 inches in diameter. Such holed stones are very frequent in\r\nEastern dolmens, and are also common in Cornwall and elsewhere;[194]\r\nbut what their purpose may have been has not yet been explained.\r\nFurther on it may be attempted. At present it is the relation of this\r\nform of chambered tumuli to external dolmens that principally interests\r\nus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 49. Dolmen at Pentre Ifan. From 'Archæologia\r\nCambrensis.']\r\n\r\nAlmost all the so-called dolmens in the Channel Islands are of this\r\nclass. One has already been given (woodcut No. 11), and it may safely\r\nbe asserted that all chambers which were wainscoted with slabs,\r\nso as to form nearly perfect walls, and all that had complicated\r\nquasi-vaulted roofs were, or were intended to be, covered with\r\nmounds--more especially those that had covered passages leading\r\nto them. There is, however, a very wide distinction between these\r\nsepulchral chambers and such a monument as this at Pentre Ifan, in\r\nPembrokeshire.[195] The top stone is so large that it is said five\r\npersons on horseback have found shelter under it from a shower of\r\nrain. Even allowing that the horses were only Welsh ponies, men do\r\nnot raise such masses and poise them on their points for the sake of\r\nhiding them again. Besides that, the supports do not and could not\r\nform a chamber. The earth would have fallen in on all sides, and the\r\nconnexion between the roof and the floor been cut off entirely, even\r\nbefore the whole was completed. Or, to take another example, that at\r\nPlas Newydd, on the shore of the Menai Strait. Here the cap stone is an\r\nenormous block, squared by art, supported on four stone legs, but with\r\nno pretence of forming a chamber. If the cap stone were merely intended\r\nas a roofing stone, one a third or fourth of its weight would have been\r\nequally serviceable and equally effective in an architectural point of\r\nview, if buried. The mode of architectural expression which these Stone\r\nmen best understood was the power of mass. At Stonehenge, at Avebury,\r\nand everywhere, as here, they sought to give dignity and expression by\r\nusing the largest blocks they could transport or raise--and they were\r\nright; for, in spite of their rudeness, they impress us now; but had\r\nthey buried them in mounds, they neither would have impressed us nor\r\ntheir contemporaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 50. Dolmen at Plas Newydd. From 'Archæologia\r\nCambrensis.']\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, however, the great argument against the theory of\r\ntheir having been always covered up is the impossibility of accounting\r\nfor the disappearance of the tumuli. If they had been situated on\r\nfertile plains where the land was valuable for agricultural purposes,\r\nit might be assumed that a civilized people with highly cultivated\r\nantiquarian tastes might have been at the trouble and expense of\r\nremoving the tumuli for the sake of the land, and of preserving the\r\ndolmens for their historical value. But that the rude peasantry of\r\nCornwall and Wales should have done this is inconceivable, more\r\nespecially as by far the greater number of these monuments are situated\r\non bleak moorlands of no agricultural value whatever. Still more\r\ninconceivable is it that they should have done it so neatly and so\r\ncarefully that no trace of the mound can now be found either around the\r\nstones or in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIf any history were attached to these Western dolmens, or any remains\r\nhad been found under them which would enable us to fix their dates,\r\neven approximately, or to arrange them in any intelligible sequence,\r\nit might be worth while recapitulating their names or illustrating\r\ntheir forms. Nothing of the sort, however, has yet been attempted;\r\nand apparently no materials exist from which any such series could be\r\nelaborated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 51. Arthur's Quoit, Gower. From a drawing by Sir Gardner\r\nWilkinson.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 52. Plan of Arthur's Quoit.]\r\n\r\nOnly one dolmen in Wales, so far as I know, bears a name; but it is the\r\nillustrious one of King Arthur. The dolmen bearing his name is situated\r\nin the peninsula of Gower, on the northern slopes of the bleak Bryn\r\nCefn, about ten miles west from Swansea.[196] It forms the centre of a\r\nvery extensive group of monuments--eighty cairns, at least, are still\r\nto be counted in an area less than half a mile in length, by a quarter\r\nof a mile in width. These are mostly small, 12 to 15 feet in diameter;\r\none, 20 feet across, was opened by Sir Gardner Wilkinson, but proved\r\nto contain no interment. The largest is 68 feet in diameter, but has\r\nnot been opened. About 350 feet from this is the dolmen. The cap stone\r\nis 14 feet 6 inches in length, 7 feet 5 inches in height, and 6 feet 8\r\ninches in breadth even now, but a very large piece has been broken off,\r\nand now lies beside it, measuring upwards of 3 feet in thickness; and\r\nanother piece seems to have been broken off on the other end, so that\r\nwhen complete it must have weighed between 35 and 40 tons. It rested\r\noriginally on ten or eleven upright stones, two of which, however,\r\nhave fallen, and only four now touch the cap stone. Sir Gardner is of\r\nopinion that it once was covered with a tumulus; but this appears\r\nvery doubtful. The slight mound, backed up with large stones, that now\r\nsurrounds it, with a diameter of 73 to 74 feet, seems an enclosure more\r\nlike that of Hob Hurst's House (woodcut No. 53) than the remains of a\r\ntumulus, and till some further evidence is adduced, we must be allowed\r\nto doubt whether any cap stone on legs was ever so treated. Sir Gardner\r\ntraced, doubtfully, an avenue, of which, however, only five stones now\r\nremain, extending to about 500 feet in a direction that would have\r\npassed the dolmen on the north, as that at Shap did the circle at its\r\nfront, or the lines at Merivale Bridge, the circle still found there;\r\nSir Gardner also points out some small circular enclosures, which, from\r\nthe analogy of those found on Dartmoor, he assumes to be hut-circles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 53. Hob Hurst's House, on Baslow Moor, Derbyshire. From\r\na drawing by Thomas Bateman.[197]]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is this group of monuments? Sir Gardner assumes that it\r\nis a cemetery of the ancient Britons; but, if so, why are not other\r\ncemeteries found in the fertile valleys and plains in South Wales?\r\nWhy did they choose one of the barest and bleakest hillsides, and one\r\nfarthest removed from their habitations as a place in which to bury\r\ntheir dead? Why did they not, like the inhabitants of Salisbury Plain,\r\ndisperse their graves pretty equally over an area of 30 miles by 10?\r\nWhy crowd them into less than half-a-mile? Without reverting to my\r\nprevious suggestion of a battle-field, I do not see how these questions\r\ncan be answered; and if so, I do not think we have far to go to look\r\nfor its name? As hinted above, Arthur's eighth battle must have been\r\nfought in Wales. The name of the place is written Guin (Gwyn), Guinon,\r\nGuinnon, Gunnion,[198] which certainly is Welsh; and when we find it\r\nimmediately preceding the battle of Caerleon on the Usk, and the\r\nprincipal monument still bearing Arthur's name, we may fairly, I think,\r\nadopt the suggestion till, at least, a better is offered.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, I think all antiquaries will agree with Sir Gardner\r\nWilkinson in assuming that this is the stone of Cetti[199] mentioned\r\nin the Welsh triads. 'The 84th Triad' speaks of the Cor of Emmrys in\r\nCaer Caradawg (another name for Salisbury), and the 88th of the three\r\nmighty achievements of the Isle of Britain, the raising of the stone\r\nof Cetti, the building of the work of Emmrys, and the heaping of the\r\npile of Cyvragnon.[200] The work of Emmrys (Ambrosius) is generally\r\nadmitted to be Stonehenge. If this is the stone of Cetti, which I see\r\nno reason for doubting, it only remains to identify the third. Most\r\nantiquaries suggest Silbury Hill; and, if I am correct in placing these\r\nthree monuments so near one another in date, this seems also extremely\r\nprobable, and so far as it goes, is a satisfactory confirmation of what\r\nhas been advanced above from other sources.\r\n\r\nFrom my ignorance of the Welsh language I am not in a position to say\r\nwhat amount of reliance should be placed in the evidence of these\r\ntriads. But Herbert and other competent scholars consider it undoubted\r\nthat Emmrys is Ambrosius, and the 'Work' referred to certainly\r\nStonehenge. If this is so, it fixes its date beyond question, and as\r\nthe other two are mentioned in the same breath it is probable they\r\nwere not distant in date. All this may be, I believe certainly is so,\r\nbut the circumstantial evidence adduced above seems to me so much\r\nclearer and so much more to be relied upon, that it derives very little\r\nadditional force from the utterance of the Welsh bards. It is, however,\r\nno doubt satisfactory that their evidence coincides with everything\r\nthat has been brought forward above, as bearing directly or indirectly\r\non their age or use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, it may be as well to revert for one moment to Hob\r\nHurst's House. It is quoted here to show how a tumulus, with a dolmen\r\non the top of it, may be connected with a low rampart so as not to\r\nconceal it, exactly, I believe, as is the case with Arthur's Quoit.\r\nBut the name of the place where it is situated may afford a hint which\r\nmay lead to something hereafter. It will be recollected that Arthur's\r\nsixth battle was fought \"super flumen quod vocatur Bassas.\" This mound\r\nis situated on \"Bas\" Moor, the Low being merely the name of the mound\r\nitself. These nominal similarities are too treacherous to be relied\r\nupon; but the more the whole group is looked at the more does it appear\r\nthat there are coincidences of name, or form, or purpose, between\r\nthose monuments here called Arthurian, which cannot all be accidental.\r\nIndividually they may not be able to resist hostile criticism, but in\r\ntheir cumulative form they appear to me to make up a very strong case\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nIf any of the other dolmens in the West had even so good a title to\r\na date as Arthur's Quoit, it might be possible to arrange them in a\r\nseries; but as none have even traditional dates, all we can now do is\r\nto suggest that the dolmen at Plas Newydd (woodcut No. 50) is of about\r\nthe same age as Arthur's Stone: perhaps something more modern, as it\r\nis more carefully squared; but this may arise from the one being a\r\nbattle-stone, the other a peaceful sepulchre. In like manner it would\r\nseem that such an exaggerated form as Pentre Ifan (woodcut No. 49) is\r\na \"tour de force\" of a still more modern date; and if we could get\r\none certainly older than any of these, a tentative scheme could be\r\nconstructed which might lead us to satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nI by no means despair of being able eventually to construct such a\r\nscheme of classification, and, even before this Work is concluded, to\r\nmake it tolerably clear that the thing is possible, and then it will\r\nonly remain, if one or two fixed or probable dates can be ascertained,\r\nto bring the whole within the range of historical investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 134: 'Iter Curiosum,' pl. xxxiii.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 135: 'Iter Curiosum,' p. xxxii.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 136: When I was there four years ago I was fortunate\r\n    enough to find an old man, a stonemason, who had been employed in\r\n    his youth in utilizing these stones.

Indeed, had not Lord Melbourne's Ministry\r\nin 1839, in a fit of ill-timed parsimony, abolished the Historical\r\nCommission attached to the Irish Ordnance Survey, we should not now\r\nbe groping in the dark. Had they even retained the services of Dr.\r\nPetrie till the time of his death, he would have left very little to\r\nbe desired in this respect. But nothing of the sort was done. The\r\nfiat went forth. All the documents and information collected during\r\nfourteen years' labour by a most competent staff of explorers were cast\r\naside--all the members dismissed on the shortest possible notice, and\r\nour knowledge of the ancient history and antiquities of Ireland thrown\r\nback half a century, at least.[201]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, a certain number of the best works of the Irish\r\nannalists have been carefully translated and edited by John O'Donovan\r\nand others, and are sufficient to enable any one not acquainted with\r\nIrish to check the wild speculations of antiquaries of the Vallancy\r\nand O'Brien class, and also to form an opinion on the value of the\r\nannals themselves, though hardly yet sufficient to enable a stranger\r\nto construct a reliable scheme of chronology or history out of the\r\nheterogeneous materials presented to him. We must wait till some second\r\nPetrie shall arise, who shall possess a sufficient knowledge of the\r\nIrish language and literature, without losing his Saxon coolness of\r\njudgment, before we can hope to possess a reliable and consecutive\r\naccount of ancient Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhen this is done, it will probably be found that the Irish possess a\r\nmore copious literature, illustrative of the eocene period of their\r\nearly history, than almost any other country of Europe. Ireland may\r\nalso boast that, never having been conquered by the Romans, she\r\nretained her native forms, and the people their native customs and\r\nfashions, uninterrupted and uninfluenced by Roman civilization, for a\r\nlonger time than the other countries of Europe which were subjected to\r\nits sway.\r\n\r\nAs most important and instructive parts of the Irish annals, it is\r\nproposed first to treat of those passages descriptive of the two\r\nbattles of Moytura[202] (Magh Tuireadh), both of which occurred\r\nwithin a period of a very few years. A description of the fields on\r\nwhich they were fought will probably be sufficient to set at rest the\r\nquestion as to the uses of cairns and circles; and if we can arrive at\r\nan approximative date, it will go far to clear up the difficulties in\r\nunderstanding the age of the most important Irish antiquities.\r\n\r\nThe narrative which contains an account of the battle of Southern\r\nMoytura, or Moytura Cong, is well known to Irish antiquaries. It\r\nhas not yet been published, but a translation from a MS. in Trinity\r\nCollege, Dublin, was made by John O'Donovan for the Ordnance Survey,\r\nand was obtained from their records above alluded to by Sir William\r\nWilde. He went over the battle-field repeatedly with the MS. in his\r\nhand, and has published a detailed account of it, with sufficient\r\nextracts to make the whole intelligible.[203] The story is briefly\r\nthis:--At a certain period of Irish history a colony of Firbolgs, or\r\nBelgæ, as they are usually called by Irish antiquaries, settled in\r\nIreland, dispossessing the Fomorians, who are said to have come from\r\nAfrica. After possessing the country for thirty-seven years, they\r\nwere in their turn attacked by a colony of Tuatha de Dananns coming\r\nfrom the north, said to be of the same race and speaking a tongue\r\nmutually intelligible. On hearing of the arrival of these strangers,\r\nthe Firbolgs advanced from the plains of Meath as far as Cong, situated\r\nbetween Lough Corrib and Lough Mask, where the first battle was fought,\r\nand, after being fiercely contested for four days, was decided in\r\nfavour of the invaders.[204]\r\n\r\nThe second battle was fought seven years afterwards, near Sligo, under\r\ncircumstances which will be detailed more fully below, and resulted\r\nequally in favour of the Tuatha de Dananns, and they in consequence\r\nobtained possession of the country, which, according to the Four\r\nMasters, they held for 197 years.[205]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 54. Circle on Battle-field of Southern Moytura. From Sir\r\nW. Wilde.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 55. Cairn on Battle-field of Southern Moytura.]\r\n\r\nThe field on which the four-days' battle of Southern Moytura was fought\r\nextends from five to six miles north and south. Near the centre of the\r\nspace, and nearly opposite the village of Cong, is a group of five\r\nstone circles, one of which, 54 feet in diameter, is represented in\r\nthe annexed woodcut (No. 54). Another, very similar, is close by; and\r\na third, larger but partially ruined, is within a few yards of the\r\nfirst. The other two can only now be traced, and two more are said to\r\nhave existed close by, but have entirely disappeared. On other parts of\r\nthe battle-field there are six or seven large cairns of stone, all of\r\nthem more or less ruined, the stones having been used to build dykes,\r\nwith which every field is surrounded in this country; but none of them\r\nhave been scientifically explored. One is represented (woodcut No. 55).\r\nSir W. Wilde has identified all of these as connected with incidents\r\nin the battle, and there seems no reason to doubt his conclusions. The\r\nmost interesting, however, is one connected with an incident in the\r\nbattle, which is worth relating, as illustrating the manner in which\r\nthe monuments corroborate the history. On the morning of the second day\r\nof the battle, King Eochy retired to a well to refresh himself with\r\na bath, when three of his enemies looking down, recognised him and\r\ndemanded his surrender. While he was parleying with them, they were\r\nattacked by his servant and killed; but the servant died immediately\r\nafterwards of his wounds, and, as the story goes, was interred with\r\nall honours in a cairn close by. In the narrative it is said that the\r\nwell where the king had so narrow an escape is the only open one in\r\nthe neighbourhood. It is so to the present day; for the peculiarity of\r\nthe country is, that the waters from Lough Mask do not flow into Lough\r\nCorrib by channels on the surface, but entirely through chasms in the\r\nrock underground, and it is only when a crack in the rock opens into\r\none of these that the water is accessible. The well in question is the\r\nonly one of these for some distance in which the water is approached\r\nby steps partly cut in the rock, partly constructed. Close by is a\r\ncairn (woodcut No. 56), called to this day the \"Cairn of the One Man.\"\r\nIt was opened by Sir W. Wilde, and in its chamber was found one urn,\r\nwhich is now deposited in the Museum of the Royal Academy at Dublin,\r\nthe excavation thus confirming the narrative in the most satisfactory\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 56. The Cairn of the \"One Man,\" Moytura.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 57. Urn in the Cairn of the \"One Man,\" Moytura.]\r\n\r\n\"The battle took place on Midsummer day. The Firbolgs were defeated\r\nwith great slaughter, and their king, who left the battle-field\r\nwith a body-guard of 100 brave men in search of water to allay his\r\nburning thirst, was followed by a party of 150 men, led by the three\r\nsons of Nemedh, who pursued him all the way to the strand, called\r\nTraigh Eothaile, near Ballysadare, in the county of Sligo. Here a\r\nfierce combat ensued, and King Eochy (Eochaidh) fell, as well as the\r\nleaders on the other side, the three sons of Nemedh.\"[206] A cairn is\r\nstill pointed out on a promontory jutting into the bay, about a mile\r\nnorth-west of the village of Ballysadare, which is said to have been\r\nerected over the remains of the king, and bones are also said to have\r\nbeen found between high and low water on the strand beneath, supposed\r\nto be those of the combatants who fell in the final struggle. It may\r\nbe otherwise, but there is a consistency between the narrative and the\r\nmonuments on the spot which can hardly be accidental, and which it will\r\nbe very difficult to explain except in the assumption that they refer\r\nto the same events.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it would be difficult to conceive anything more satisfactory\r\nand confirmatory of the record than the monuments on the plain; and no\r\none, I fancy, could go over the field with Sir William's book in his\r\nhand, without feeling the importance of his identifications. Of course\r\nit may be suggested that the book was written by some one familiar with\r\nthe spot, to suit the localities. The probability, however, of this\r\nhaving been done before the ninth century, and done so soberly and so\r\nwell, is very remote, and the guess that but one urn would be found\r\nin the cairn of the \"One Man,\" is a greater piece of luck than could\r\nreasonably be expected. Even, however, if the book was written to suit\r\nthe localities, it will not invalidate the fact that a great battle was\r\nfought on this spot, and that these cairns and these circles mark the\r\ngraves of those who fell in the fight.\r\n\r\nThe collection of monuments on the battle-field of Northern Moytura is\r\neven more interesting than that on Moytura Cong, and almost justified\r\nthe assertion of Petrie \"that, excepting the monuments at Carnac,\r\nin Brittany, it is, even in its present state of ruin, the largest\r\nassemblage of the kind hitherto discovered in the world.\"[207] They\r\nhave also this advantage, that the principal group, consisting of some\r\nsixty or seventy monuments, are situated on an elevated table-land, and\r\nin an area extending not more than a mile in one direction, and about\r\nhalf a mile in another. The country, too, is much less stony than about\r\nCong, so that the monuments stand out better and have a more imposing\r\nlook. Petrie examined and described sixty-four monuments as situated in\r\nor around this space, and came to the conclusion that originally there\r\ncould not have been less than 200.[208] My impression is that there\r\nmay have been 100, but hardly more, though, of course, this is only a\r\nguess, and the destruction of them is going on so rapidly that he may\r\nbe right after all.\r\n\r\nIn the space above described almost every variety of Megalithic\r\nart is to be found. There are stone cairns, with dolmens in their\r\ninteriors--dolmens standing alone, but which have been evidently always\r\nexposed; dolmens with single circles; others with two or three circles\r\nof stones around them; and circles without dolmens or anything else in\r\nthe centres. The only form we miss is the avenue. Nothing of the sort\r\ncan now, at least, be traced, nor does it seem that any of the circles\r\npossessed such appendages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 58. Battle-field of Northern Moytura.\r\n\r\nScale 6 inches to 1 mile.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed woodcut (No. 58) will explain the disposition of the\r\nprincipal group. It is taken from the Ordnance Survey, and is perfectly\r\ncorrect as far as it goes, but being only on the 6-inch scale, is\r\ntoo small to show the form of the monuments.[209] In the centre is,\r\nor rather was, a great cairn, called Listoghil. It is marked by\r\nPetrie as No. 51, but having for years been used as a quarry for the\r\nneighbourhood, it is now so mined that it is difficult to make out\r\neither its plan or dimensions. Petrie says it is 150 feet in diameter;\r\nI made it 120. It was surrounded by a circle of great stones, within\r\nwhich was the cairn, originally, probably, 40 or 50 feet high. All this\r\nhas been removed to such an extent as to expose the kistvaen or dolmen\r\nin its centre. Its cap stone is 10 feet square and 2 feet thick, and is\r\nof limestone, as are its supports. All the other monuments are composed\r\nof granite boulders. \"Those who first opened it assert that they found\r\nnothing within but burnt wood and human bones. The half-calcined bones\r\nof horses and other animals were and are still found in this cairn in\r\ngreat quantities\" (Petrie, p. 250). In a note it is said that a large\r\nspear-head of stone (flint?) was also found in this cairn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 59. Sketch-plan of Circle 27, Northern Moytura.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed woodcut (No. 59) will give an idea of the general\r\ndisposition of a circle numbered 27 by Petrie.[210] It is of about the\r\nmedium size, being 60 feet in diameter. The general dimensions of the\r\ncircles are 40, 60, 80, and one (No. 46) is 120 feet in diameter. The\r\nouter circle of No. 27 is composed of large stones, averaging 6 feet in\r\nheight, and some 20 feet in circumference. Inside this is a circle of\r\nsmaller stones, nearly obliterated by the turf, and in the centre is a\r\nthree-chambered dolmen, of which fifteen stones still remain; but all\r\nthe cap stones, except that of the central inner chamber, are gone, and\r\nthat now stands on its edge in front of its support.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of this circle will be understood from the\r\nannexed view (woodcut No. 60), taken from a photograph. It does not,\r\nhowever, do justice to its appearance, as the camera was placed too low\r\nand does not look into the circle, as the eye does. In the distance is\r\nseen the hill, called Knock na Rea, surmounted by the so-called Cairn\r\nof Queen Meave, of which more hereafter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 60. View of Circle 27, Northern Moytura. From a\r\nphotograph.]\r\n\r\nAnother of these circles, No. 7, is thus described by Petrie:--\"This\r\ncircle, with its cromlech, are perfect. Its diameter is 37 feet, and\r\nthe number of stones thirty-two. The cromlech is about 8 feet high, the\r\ntable-stone resting on six stones of great magnitude: it is 9 feet long\r\nand 23 feet in circumference.\" Its general appearance will be seen in\r\nthe annexed view from a photograph (woodcut No. 61); though this, as in\r\nthe last instance, is far from doing justice to its appearance.[211]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 61. Dolmen, with Circle, No. 7, Northern Moytura. From a\r\nphotograph.]\r\n\r\nNo. 37 is described by Dr. Petrie (p. 248) as a triple circle. The\r\ninner one 40 feet in diameter. The second of twelve large stones,\r\nand of 80 feet, the third as a circle of 120 feet in diameter. \"The\r\ncromlech is of the smallest size, not more than 4 feet in height. The\r\ncircumference of the stone table is 16 feet, and it rests on five\r\nsupporters.\"\r\n\r\nExcavations were made into almost all these monuments either by Mr.\r\nWalker, the proprietor of the ground, or by Dr. Petrie, and, with\r\nscarcely one exception, they yielded evidence of sepulchral uses.\r\nEither human bones were found or urns containing ashes. No iron,\r\napparently, was found in any. A bronze sword is said to have been\r\nfound, forty years ago, in 63; but generally there was nothing but\r\nimplements of bone or stone. At the time Petrie wrote (1837) these\r\nwere not valued, or classified, as they have since been; so we cannot\r\ndraw any inference from them as to the age of the monuments, and no\r\ncollection, that I am aware of, exists in which these \"finds\" are now\r\naccessible. Indeed, I am afraid that Petrie and those who worked with\r\nhim were too little aware of the importance of these material points of\r\nevidence, to be careful either to collect or to describe the contents\r\nof these graves; and as all or nearly all have been opened, that source\r\nof information may be cut off for ever.\r\n\r\nBesides these monuments on the battle-field, there are two others,\r\nsituated nearly equidistant from it, and which seem to belong to the\r\nsame group; one known as the Tomb of Misgan Meave, the celebrated\r\nQueen of Connaught, who lived apparently contemporaneously with Cæsar\r\nAugustus, or rather, as the annalists insist, with Jesus Christ;[212]\r\nthough, according to the more accurate Tighernach, her death occurred\r\nin the 7th year of Vespasian, in A.D. 75.[213] It is situated\r\non the top of a high hill known as Knock na Rea (woodcut No. 60),\r\nat a distance of two miles westward from the battle-field. It was\r\ndescribed by the Rt. Hon. William Burton, in 1779, as an enormous heap\r\nof small stones, and is of an oval figure, 650 feet in circumference\r\nat the base, 79 feet slope on one side and 67 feet on the other. The\r\narea on the top is 100 feet in its longest diameter and 85 feet in\r\nits shortest. When Petrie visited it in 1837, it was only 590 feet in\r\ncircumference, and the longest diameter on the top only 80 feet. It\r\nhad in the interval, in fact, been used as a quarry; and I have no\r\ndoubt but that the flat top originally measured the usual 100 feet,\r\nand was circular. \"Around its base,\" says Petrie, \"are the remains\r\nof many sepulchral monuments of lesser importance, consisting of\r\ngroups of large stones forming circular or oval enclosures. A careful\r\nexcavation within these tombs by Mr. Walker resulted in the discovery\r\nnot only of human interments, but also of several rude ornaments and\r\nimplements of stone of a similar character to those usually found in\r\nsepulchres of this class in Ireland, and which, being unaccompanied by\r\nany others of a metallic nature, identify this group of monuments as\r\nof contemporaneous age with those of Carrowmore, among which no iron\r\nremains are known to have been discovered, and mark them as belonging\r\nto any period of semi-civilized society in Ireland.\"[214]\r\n\r\nFrom their situation, it seems hardly possible to doubt that these\r\nsmaller tombs are contemporaneous with or subsequent to the Great\r\nCairn; and if this really were the tomb of Queen Meave, it would throw\r\nsome light on our subject. The great cairn has not, however, been dug\r\ninto yet; and till that is done the ownership of the tomb cannot be\r\ndefinitely fixed. There are several reasons, however, for doubting\r\nthe tradition. In the first place, we have the direct testimony of a\r\ncommentary written by Moelmuiri, that Meave (Meahbh) was buried at\r\nRathcroghan, which was the proper burying-place of her race; \"her body\r\nhaving been removed by her people from Fert Medhbha; for they deemed it\r\nmore honourable to have her interred at Cruachan.\"[215] As the Book of\r\nthe Cemeteries confirms this, there seems no good reason for doubting\r\nthe fact, though she may have first been laid in this neighbourhood,\r\nwhich may have given rise to the tradition.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we may trust Beowulf's description of a\r\nwarrior's grave, as it was understood in the 5th century, no tomb in\r\nthese islands would answer more perfectly to his ideal than the Cairn\r\non Knock na Rea:--\r\n\r\n  \"Then wrought\r\n  The people of the Westerns\r\n  A mound over the sea.\r\n  It was high and broad,\r\n  By the sea-faring man\r\n  To be seen afar.\"\r\n\r\nThat an Irish queen should be buried on a mountain-top overlooking the\r\nWestern Ocean seems most improbable, and is opposed to the evidence we\r\nhave; but that a Viking warrior should be so buried, overlooking the\r\nsea and a battle-field, seems natural; but who he may have been is for\r\nfuture investigators to discover.\r\n\r\nThe other cairn is situated just two miles eastward from the\r\nbattle-field, on an eminence overlooking Loch Gill. It is less in\r\nheight than the so-called Queen's Tomb, but the top is nearly perfect,\r\nand has a curious saucer-like depression, as nearly as can be measured,\r\n100 feet in diameter. It has never been dug into, nor, so far as I\r\ncould learn, does any tradition attach to it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe history of the Battle of Northern Moytura, as told in the Irish\r\nAnnals, is briefly as follows:[216]--\r\n\r\nNuada, who was king of the Tuatha de Dananns when the battle of\r\nSouthern Moytura was fought, lost his arm in the fight. This, however,\r\nsome skilled artificers whom he had with him skilfully replaced by one\r\nmade of silver; so that he was always afterwards known as Nuada of\r\nthe Silver Hand. Whether from this cause or some other not explained,\r\nhe resigned the chief sovereignty to Breas, who, though a Fomorian by\r\nbirth, held a chief command in the Tuatha de Danann army. Owing to\r\nhis penurious habits and domineering disposition, Breas soon rendered\r\nhimself very unpopular with the nobles of his Court; and, at a time\r\nwhen the discontent was at its height, a certain poet and satirist,\r\nCairbré, the son of the poetess Etan, arrived at his Court. He was\r\ntreated by the king in so shabby a manner and with such disrespect,\r\nthat he left it in disgust; but, before doing so, he wrote and\r\npublished so stinging a satire against the king, as to set the blood\r\nof the nobles boiling with indignation, and they insisted on his\r\nresigning the power he had held for seven years. \"To this call the\r\nregent reluctantly acceded; and, having held a council with his mother,\r\nthey both determined to retire to the Court of his father Elatha,\r\nat this time the great chief of Fomorian pirates, or Sea Kings, who\r\nthen swarmed through all the German Ocean and ruled over the Shetland\r\nIslands and the Hebrides.\"\r\n\r\nElatha agreed to provide his son with a fleet to conquer Ireland for\r\nhimself from the Tuatha de Danann, if he could; and for this purpose\r\ncollected all the men and ships lying from Scandinavia westwards for\r\nthe intended invasion, the chief command being entrusted to Balor of\r\nthe Evil Eye, conjointly with Breas. Having landed near Sligo, they\r\npitched their tents on the spot--Carrowmore--where the battle was\r\nafterwards fought.\r\n\r\nHere they were attacked by Nuada of the Silver Hand, accompanied by the\r\ngreat Daghda, who had taken a prominent part in the previous battle,\r\nand other chiefs of note. The battle took place on the last day of\r\nOctober, and is eloquently described. The Fomorians were defeated, and\r\ntheir chief men killed. King Nuada was slain by Balor of the Evil Eye,\r\nbut Balor himself fell soon after by a stone flung at him by Lug his\r\ngrandson by his daughter Eithlenn.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of forty years, according to the 'Annals of the Four\r\nMasters,' the Daghda succeeded to the vacant throne, and reigned eighty\r\nyears.[217]\r\n\r\nFrom the above abstract--all the important passages of which are in the\r\nexact words of the translation--it is evident that the author of the\r\ntract considered the Fomorians and the Tuatha de Danann as the same\r\npeople, or at least as two tribes of the same race, the chiefs of which\r\nwere closely united to one another by intermarriage. He also identifies\r\nthem with the Scandinavian Vikings, who played so important a part in\r\nIrish history down to the Battle of Clontarf, which happened in 1014.\r\n\r\nThis may at first sight seem very improbable. We must not, however,\r\nforget the celebrated lines of Claudian:[218] \"Maduerunt Saxone fuso\r\nOrcades: incaluit Pictorum sanguine Thule: Scotorum cumulos flevit\r\nglacialis Ierne.\" This, it may be said, was written three or even four\r\ncenturies after the events of which we are now speaking; but it was\r\nalso written five centuries before the Northmen are generally supposed\r\nto have occupied the Orkneys or to have interfered in the affairs of\r\nIreland, and does point to an earlier state of affairs, though how much\r\nanterior to the poet's time there is nothing to show.\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently proposed to identify the Dananns with the Danes,\r\nfrom the similarity of their names. Till I visited Sligo, I confess\r\nI always looked on this as one of those random guesses from identity\r\nof mere sound which are generally very deceptive in investigations of\r\nthis sort. The monuments, however, on the battle-field correspond so\r\nnearly to those figured by Madsen in his 'Antiquités préhistoriques\r\ndu Danemark,'[219] and their disposition is so similar to that of the\r\nBraavalla feld[220] and other battle-fields in Scandinavia, that it\r\nwill now require very strong evidence to the contrary to disprove an\r\nobvious and intimate connection between them.\r\n\r\nIn concluding his account of the battle, Mr. O'Curry adds: \"Cormac Mac\r\nCullinan, in his celebrated Glossary, quotes this tract in illustration\r\nof the word _Nes_; so that so early as the ninth century it was looked\r\nupon by him as a very ancient historic composition of authority.\"[221]\r\nIf this is so, there seems no good reason for doubting his having\r\nspoken of events and things perfectly within his competence, and so we\r\nmay consider the account above given as historical till at least some\r\ngood cause is shown to the contrary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt now only remains to try and find out if any means exist by which the\r\ndates of these two battles of Moytura can be fixed with anything like\r\ncertainty. If we turn to the 'Annals of the Four Masters,' which is the\r\nfavourite authority with Irish antiquaries, we get a startling answer\r\nat once. The battle of Moytura Cong, according to them, took place in\r\nthe year of the world 3303, and the second battle twenty-seven years\r\nafterwards.[222] The twenty is a gratuitous interpolation. This is\r\nequivalent to 1896 and 1869 years before Christ. Alphabetical writing\r\nwas not, as we shall presently see, introduced into Ireland till after\r\nthe Christian Era, the idea therefore that the details of these two\r\nbattles should have been preserved orally during 2000 years, and all\r\nthe intermediate events forgotten, is simply ridiculous. The truth of\r\nthe matter seems to be that the 'Four Masters,' like truly patriotic\r\nIrishmen in the middle of the seventeenth century, thought it necessary\r\nfor the honour of their country to carry back its history to the Flood\r\nat least. As the country at the time of the Tuatha de Dananns was\r\ndivided into five kingdoms,[223] and at other times into twenty-five,\r\nthey had an abundance of names of chiefs at their disposal, and instead\r\nof treating them as cotemporary, they wrote them out consecutively,\r\ntill they reached back to Ceasair--not Julius--but a granddaughter\r\nof Noah, who came to Ireland forty days before the Flood, with fifty\r\ngirls and three men, who consequently escaped the fate of the rest of\r\nmankind, and peopled the western isle. This is silly enough, but their\r\ntreatment of the hero of Moytura is almost as much so. Allowing that\r\nhe was thirty years of age when he took so prominent a part in the\r\nsecond battle, in 3330, he must have been seventy-one when he ascended\r\nthe Irish throne, and, after a reign of seventy-nine years, have died\r\nat the ripe old age of 150, from the effects of a poisoned wound he\r\nhad received 120 years previously. The 'Four Masters' say eighty\r\nyears earlier, but this is only another of their thousand and one\r\ninaccuracies.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from these to the far more authentic annals of Tighernach,\r\nwho died 1088 A.D., we are met at once by his often quoted\r\ndictum to the effect that \"omnia Monumenta Scotorum usque Cimboeth\r\nincerta erant.\"[224] It would have been more satisfactory if he could\r\nhave added that after that time they could be depended upon, but\r\nthis seems by no means to have been the case. As, however, Cimboeth\r\nis reported to have founded Armagh, in the year 289 B.C.,\r\nit gives us a limit beyond which we cannot certainly proceed without\r\ndanger and difficulty. We get on surer ground when we reach the reign\r\nof Crimthann, who, according to Tighernach, died in the year of our\r\nera 85, after a reign of 16 years.[225] The 'Four Masters,' it is true,\r\nmake him contemporary with Christ; but even Dr. O'Donovan is obliged\r\nto confess that all these earlier reigns, after the Christian era,\r\nare antedated to about the same extent.[226] Unfortunately for our\r\npurpose, however, Tighernach's early annals are almost wholly devoted\r\nto the chronicles of the kings of Emania or Armagh, and it is only\r\nincidentally that he names the kings of Tara, which was the capital\r\nboth of the Firbolgs and Tuatha de Dananns, and he makes no allusion to\r\nthe battles of Moytura. Though our annalist, therefore, to a certain\r\nextent deserts us here, there are incidental notices of the Daghda\r\nand his friends in Irish manuscripts referring to other subjects,\r\nwhich seem sufficient to settle the question. The best of these were\r\ncollected together for another purpose by Petrie, in his celebrated\r\nwork on the Round Towers, and, as they are easily accessible there, it\r\nwill not be necessary to quote them in extenso, but merely the passages\r\nbearing directly on our subject.[227]\r\n\r\nThe first extract is from a very celebrated work known as the 'Leabhar\r\nna l'Uidhre,' written apparently before 1106, which is given by the\r\n'Four Masters' as the date of the author's death. Speaking of Cormac,\r\nthe son of Art and grandson of Conn of a Hundred Battles:--\"Before his\r\ndeath, which happened in 267, he told his people not to bury him at\r\nBrugh, on the Boyne, where the kings of Tara, his predecessors, were\r\nburied, because he did not adore stones and trees, and did not worship\r\nthe same god as those interred at Brugh, for he had faith,\" adds the\r\nmonkish chronicler, \"in the one true God according to the law.\"\r\n\r\nThe tract then goes on to say that \"the kings of the race of Heremon\r\nwere buried at Cruachan until the times of Crimthann, who was the first\r\nking of them that was buried in Brugh.\" The others, including Queen\r\nMeave, were buried at Cruachan, because they possessed Connaught.\r\n\"But they were interred at Brugh from the time of Crimthann to the\r\ntime of Leoghaire, the son of Niall (A.D. 428), except three\r\npersons, namely Art the son of Conn, and Cormac the son of Art, and\r\nNiall of the Nine Hostages.\" A little further on we have the following\r\nparagraph:--\"(101.) The nobles of the Tuatha de Danann were used\r\nto bury at Brugh, _i.e._, the Dagdha with his three sons, and also\r\nLughaidh and Oe, and Ollam and Ogma, and Etan the poetess, and Corpre\r\nthe son of Etan, and Crimthann followed them because his wife was one\r\nof the Tuatha Dea, and it was she that solicited him that he should\r\nadopt Brugh as a burying-place for himself and his descendants.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 'Book of Ballymote' (p. 102) it is said, \"Of the monument of\r\nBrugh here, viz., The Bed of daughter of Forann. The monument of the\r\nDaghda. The mound of the Morrigan. The Barc of Crimthann in which he\r\nwas interred. The Carnail (stone cairn) of Conn of a Hundred Battles,\"\r\n&c. In a second passage we recognise the following names rather\r\nmore in detail: \"The Bed of the Dagdha first, the two paps of the\r\nMorrigan, at the place where Cermud Milbhel, the son of the Dagdha\r\nwas born[228]--(the monuments of) Cirr and Cuirrell wives of the\r\nDagdha--there are two hillocks; the grave of Aedh Luirgnech, son of the\r\nDagdha.\" Again, in a prose commentary on a poem which Petrie quotes, we\r\nhave the following apparently by Moelmuori. \"The chiefs of Ulster before\r\nConchobar (he is said to have died 33[229]) were buried at Talten....\r\nThe nobles of the Tuatha de Dananns, with the exception of seven who\r\nwere interred at Talten, were buried in Brugh, _i.e._, Lugh and Oe, son\r\nof Ollamh and Ogma, and Carpre the son of Etan, and Etan (the poetess\r\nherself), and the Daghda and her three sons, and a great many others\r\n`of the Tuatha de Danann, Firbolgs, and others.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that many similar passages to these might be\r\nfound in Irish MSS., if looked for by competent scholars, but these\r\nextracts probably are sufficient to prove two things. First, that\r\nthe celebrated cemetery at Brugh, on the Boyne, six miles west from\r\nDrogheda, was the burying-place of the kings of Tara from Crimthann\r\n(A.D. 84) till the time of St. Patrick (A.D. 432), and that it was\r\nalso the burying-place of all those who were concerned--without being\r\nkilled--in the battles of Moytura. We are not, unfortunately, able to\r\nidentify the grave of each of these heroes, though it may be because\r\nonly one has been properly explored, that called New Grange, and that\r\nhad been rifled before the first modern explorers in the seventeenth\r\ncentury found out the entrance. The Hill of Dowth has only partially\r\nbeen opened. The great cairn of Knowth is untouched, so is the great\r\ncairn known as the Tomb of the Dagdha. Excavations alone can prove\r\ntheir absolute identity; but this at least is certain, we have on the\r\nbanks of the Boyne a group of monuments similar in external appearance\r\nat least with those on the two Moytura battle-fields, and the date of\r\nthe greater number of those at Brugh is certainly subsequent to the\r\nChristian era.[230]\r\n\r\nThe second point is not capable of such direct proof, but seems equally\r\nclear. It is that the kings of the race of Crimthann immediately\r\nsucceeded to the kings of the Tuatha de Danann, who fought at Moytura.\r\nIf, indeed, we could trust the assertion that Crimthann was the first\r\nking that was buried at Brugh, we should be obliged to find a place for\r\nthe Daghda under some pseudonym afterwards, and it is possible that\r\nmay be the case,[231] but for the present it seems more reasonable to\r\nassume that he preceded him at a very short interval.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 'Four Masters,' the Tuatha de Danann had been extinct\r\nfor nearly 2000 years when we find Crimthann marrying a princess of\r\nthat race, and one of sufficient influence to induce him to adopt what\r\nappears literally to have been the family burying-place of the Dagdha\r\nfor that of himself and his race; and it seems impossible to believe\r\nthat when this took place it could have been old, or neglected, or\r\ndeserted.\r\n\r\nAccording to the 'Four Masters,' the Firbolgs reigned thirty-seven\r\nyears only, so that they do not in this case seem to err on the side of\r\nexaggeration, and the Tuatha de Danann 196 years. From this, however,\r\nwe must deduct the twenty years they unnecessarily interpolated between\r\nthe two battles, and we must take something from the eighty years the\r\nDagdha reigned after he was ninety-one years of age. If we allow, then,\r\na century, it will place the battles of Moytura 20 to 30 B.C.,\r\nand the arrival of the Firbolgs about the middle of the first century\r\nB.C. This, with a small limit of error either way is, I am\r\nconvinced, pretty nearly the true date of these events.[232]\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the celebrated Hill of Tara, about ten miles off, where\r\nthose resided who were buried at Brugh-na-Boinne, we find a great deal\r\nto confirm the views expressed above. When Petrie was attached to the\r\nOrdnance Survey, he had a very careful plan made of the remains on that\r\nhill, and compiled a most elaborate memoir regarding them, which was\r\npublished in the eighteenth volume of the 'Transactions of the Royal\r\nIrish Academy.' It concludes with these words (p. 231): \"From the\r\nhistorical allusions deduced it will be seen that, with the exception\r\nof the few last described,[233] they are all nearly contemporaneous\r\nand belong to the third century of the Christian era. The era of the\r\noriginal Tuatha de Danann Cathair belongs to the remote period of\r\nuncertain tradition. The only other monuments of ascertained date are\r\nthose of Conor Mac Nessa and Cuchullim, both of whom flourished in the\r\nfirst century. These facts are sufficient to prove that before the\r\ntime of Cormac Mac Art,[234] Tara had attained to no distinguished\r\ncelebrity.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 62. Rath na Riogh, or, Cathair of Cormac, at Tara.]\r\n\r\nThe only difficulty in this passage is the allusion to the Tuatha de\r\nDanann. At the time Petrie wrote it he, like most Irish antiquaries,\r\nhad been unable to emancipate himself from the spell of the 'Four\r\nMasters,' and, struck by the pains they had taken, and the general\r\ncorrectness of their annals after the Christian era, had adopted their\r\npre-Christian chronology almost without question. The Cathair here\r\nalluded to is only an undistinguishable part of the Rath of Cormac,\r\nto which tradition attaches that name, but neither in plan, nor\r\nmaterials, nor construction can be separated from it. That the Dananns\r\nhad a Cathair on this hill is more than probable if, as I suppose,\r\nthey immediately preceded the Crimthann dynasty, who certainly resided\r\nhere. It may also well be that they occupied this site, which is the\r\nhighest on the hill, and that their palace was afterwards enlarged by\r\nCormac. The plan of it is worth referring to (woodcut No. 62), from its\r\ncurious resemblance to that of Avebury; what was here done in earth was\r\nafterwards done in stone in Wiltshire, and it seems as if, as is so\r\noften the case, the house of the dead was copied from the dwelling of\r\nthe living.\r\n\r\nThe Dagdha had apparently no residence here. From the context I would\r\ninfer that he resided in the great Rath, about 300 feet diameter, at\r\nDowth, where his son, apparently, was born, and near to which, as above\r\nshown, he also was buried. If, however, he had no residence on the\r\nRoyal hill, his so-called spit was one of the most celebrated pieces of\r\nfurniture of the palace. It was a most elaborate piece of ironmongery,\r\nand performed a variety of cooking operations in a very astonishing\r\nmanner, and shows, at all events, that the smith who made it had no\r\nlittle skill in the working of iron, of which metal it was principally\r\ncomposed.[235]\r\n\r\nThe Rath of Leoghaire (429-458 A.D.) is interesting to us,\r\nnot only as the last erected here, but from the circumstances of its\r\nbuilder being buried in its ramparts. It seems that, in spite of all\r\nthe preaching and persuasions of St. Patrick, who was his contemporary,\r\nLeoghaire refused to be converted to the Christian religion; but like\r\na grand old Pagan, he ordered that he should be buried standing in his\r\narmour in the rampart of his Rath, and facing the country of the foes\r\nwith whom he had contended during life. That this was done is as well\r\nauthenticated as any incident of the time, perhaps even better;[236]\r\nand I cannot help fancying from the appearance of the Raths, that some\r\nothers of the kings were interred here also. Be that as it may, this\r\ncircumstance ought to prevent our feeling any surprise at the actual\r\ndiscovery of the skeleton of a man under the rampart at Marden (_ante_\r\np. 86), or if human bones were still found under the vallum at Avebury,\r\nin spite of the negative evidence of the partial explorations of the\r\nWiltshire Archæological Society.\r\n\r\nThere is still another point of view from which this question may be\r\nregarded, so as to throw some light on the main issue of the age of\r\nthe monuments in question. If we can ascertain when the art of writing\r\nwas first practised in Ireland, we may obtain an approximate date\r\nbefore which no detailed history of any events could be expected to\r\nexist. Now all the best antiquaries of Ireland are agreed that no\r\nalphabetic writing was used in Ireland before the reign of Cormac Mac\r\nArt, A.D. 218-266. There seems to be evidence that, as above\r\nmentioned, he was converted to Christianity by some Romish priest; and\r\nthough it is unlikely that he himself acquired the art of writing, he\r\nseems to have caused certain tracts to be compiled. None of these, it\r\nis true, now exist, but they are referred to and quoted from an ancient\r\nIrish MS. in a manner that leaves little doubt that some books were\r\nwritten in Ireland in the third century, but almost certainly there\r\nwere none before that time. It is true, however, that Eugene O'Curry\r\npleads hard for some kind of Ogham writing having existed in Ireland\r\nbefore that time, and even before the Christian era.[237] But though\r\nwe may admit the former proposition, the evidence of the latter is of\r\nthe most unsatisfactory description. Even, however, if it could be\r\nestablished it would prove very little. It would be as difficult to\r\nwrite a connected history in Ogham as it would be in Exchequer tallies,\r\nand so far as is known, it never was attempted. The utmost Ogham\r\never did, or could do, was to record genealogies; and such detailed\r\nhistories as we possess of the Moytura battles are quite beyond its\r\npowers. On the other hand, Mr. O'Curry's own account of Senchan's\r\ndifficulties in obtaining copies of the celebrated 'Táin Bó Chuailgne,'\r\nor 'Cattle Spoil of Cooley,' after the year 598, shows how little the\r\nart was then practised. No copy of this poem, which contains the life\r\nand adventures of Queen Meave, in the first century, then existed in\r\nIreland. A mission was consequently sent to Italy to copy one said\r\nto have existed there, and though the missionaries were miraculously\r\nspared the journey,[238] the inference is the same, that no written\r\ncopy of their most celebrated work existed in Ireland in the year 600.\r\n\r\nPetrie is equally clear on the subject. In his history of Tara\r\nhe states that the Irish were unacquainted with letters till the\r\nintroduction of Christianity in the fifth century, with the doubtful\r\nexception of the writings ascribed to Cormac Mac Art. He consequently\r\nbelieves that the authentic history of Ireland commences only with\r\nTuathal, A.D. 130, 160, in which he is probably correct.[239]\r\n\r\nBut here the question arises--Before the introduction of writing into\r\na country, how long could so detailed a narrative as that which we\r\npossess of the Battles of Moytura, and one so capable of being verified\r\nby material evidences on the spot, be handed down orally as a plain\r\nprose narrative? Among so rude a people as the Irish avowedly then\r\nwere, would this period be one century or two, or how many? Every\r\none must decide for himself. I do not know an instance of any rude\r\npeople preserving orally any such detailed history for a couple of\r\ncenturies. With me the great difficulty is to understand how the memory\r\nof the battles was so perfectly preserved, assuming them to have taken\r\nplace so long ago as the first century B.C. As it is not\r\npretended that the narratives were reduced to writing so early as the\r\ntime of Cormac, I should, from their internal evidence, be much more\r\ninclined to assume that the battles must have taken place one or two\r\ncenturies after the birth of Christ. At all events, it seems absolutely\r\nimpossible that the date of these battles can be so remote as the Four\r\nMasters place them, or even as some Irish antiquaries seem inclined to\r\nadmit.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter appears to be that, in the Eocene period\r\nof Irish history or in the one or two centuries that preceded the\r\nintroduction of writing, we have a whole group of names so inextricably\r\nmixed together that it is impossible to separate them. We have the\r\nDagdha and his wives and their sons. We have Etan the poetess and her\r\nill-conditioned son. There is Queen Meave of the Cattle Raid, and her\r\nhusband Conchobhar McNessa. There is Cumbhail, the Fingal of Macpherson\r\nand Cuchullin; and then such semi-historical persons as Tuathal the\r\nAccepted, and Conn of a Hundred Battles. All these lived almost\r\ntogether in one capital, and were buried in one cemetery, and form a\r\nhalf-historic, half-mythic group, such as generally precedes written\r\nhistory in most parts of the world. Many of their dates are known\r\nwith fairly approximate certainty, whilst that of others cannot be\r\nfixed. There seems, however, enough to justify us in almost positively\r\naffirming that the Battle of Moytura, which raised the Dagdha to\r\nfame, happened within the fifty years that preceded or the fifty that\r\nfollowed the birth of Christ. My own impression is in favour of the\r\nformer as the more probable date.\r\n\r\nTo some this may appear an over-laboured disquisition to prove an\r\ninsignificant point. It is not, however, one-tenth part of what might\r\nbe advanced on the subject from translated and printed documents, and,\r\ncertainly, it would be difficult to exaggerate its importance with\r\nreference to the subject matter of this work. If the two groups of\r\nmonuments at Cong and Carrowmore can be proved to be the monuments of\r\nthose who fell in the two battles of Southern and Northern Moytura,\r\nwe have made an immense step towards a knowledge of the use of these\r\nmonuments; and if it can be shown that they date from about the\r\nChristian Era, we gain not only a standpoint for settling the age\r\nof all other Irish antiquities, but a base for our reasoning with\r\nreference to similar remains in other countries.\r\n\r\nNo Irish antiquary, nor indeed of any other country, so far as I know,\r\nhas ventured to hint a doubt that they mark the battle-fields. Nor, in\r\nthe present state of the evidence, do I see any reason for questioning\r\nthe fact; and, for the present at least, we may assume it as granted.\r\nThe second proposition is more open to question. Irish antiquaries\r\ngenerally will dissent from so serious a reduction in the antiquity of\r\nthese two great battles. But, after the most earnest attention I have\r\nbeen able to give to all that has been written and said on the subject\r\nand a careful comparison of the monuments on these fields with those\r\nof other countries, I would, on the whole, be inclined to bring them\r\nforward a century or two, if I could find a gap to throw them into,\r\nrather than date them earlier. They look older and more tentative than\r\nthe English circles described in the last chapter, but not so much\r\nso as to lead us to expect a difference of four or five centuries.\r\nOn the other hand, they are so like those on the Bravalla field, and\r\nother monuments in Scandinavia, to be described hereafter, that it is\r\npuzzling to think that seven or ten centuries elapsed between them.\r\nBut, taking all the circumstances of the case into consideration,\r\nthe conclusions above arrived at appear fair and reasonable, and in\r\nconformity, not only to what was said in the last chapter, but to the\r\nfacts about to be adduced in the following pages.\r\n\r\n\r\nCEMETERIES.\r\n\r\nAlthough Irish antiquaries have succeeded in identifying the localities\r\nof a considerable number of the thousand and one battles which, as\r\nmight be expected, adorn at every page the annals of a Celtic race;\r\nyet, as none of these are described as marked with circles or cairns,\r\nlike those found on the two battle-fields of Moytura, they are of\r\nno use for our present purpose, and our further illustrations must\r\nbe drawn from the peaceful burying-places of the Irish, which are,\r\nhowever, of singular interest.\r\n\r\nIn the history of the Cemeteries, eight are enumerated;[240] but\r\nof these only the first three can be identified with anything like\r\ncertainty at the present day. But as the antiquities of Ireland have\r\nnever yet been systematically explored, others may yet be found, and so\r\nalso may many more stone-marked battle-fields. Meanwhile our business\r\nis with\r\n\r\n  \"The three cemeteries of the idolaters:\r\n  The Cemetery of Tailten the select,\r\n  The Cemetery of the ever fair Cruachan,\r\n  And the Cemetery of Brugh.\"[241]\r\n\r\nThe two last are known with certainty. The first is most probably the\r\nrange of mounds at Lough Crew, recently explored by Mr. Conwell; but,\r\nas some doubt this identification, we shall take it last, and speak\r\nfirst of those regarding which there is more certainty.\r\n\r\nCruachan, or Rathcrogan, is situated five miles west from\r\nCarrick-on-Shannon, and consists, according to Petrie, of a circular\r\nstone ditch,[242] now nearly obliterated, 300 feet in diameter. Within\r\nthis \"are small circular mounds, which, when examined, are found to\r\ncover rude sepulchral chambers, formed of stone, without cement of\r\nany kind, and containing unburnt bones.\" The monument of Dathi (428\r\nA.D.), which is a small circular mound with a pillar-stone of\r\nRed Sandstone, is situated outside the enclosure, at a short distance\r\nto the east, and may be identified from the following notice of it\r\nby the celebrated antiquary Duald Mac Firbis. \"The body of Dathi was\r\nbrought to Cruachan, and was interred at Relig na Riogh, where most of\r\nthe kings of the race of Heremon were buried, and where to this date\r\nthe Red Stone pillar remains on a stone monument over his grave, near\r\nRath Cruachan, to this time (1666).\"[243]\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, we have the familiar 300-foot circle, with the\r\nexternal burial, as at Arbor Low, and external stone monument as\r\nat Salkeld and elsewhere. The chief distinction between this and\r\nour English battle-circles seems to be the number of cairns, each\r\ncontaining a chamber, which crowd the circle at Rath Crogan, and it is\r\npossible that if these were opened with great care, a succession might\r\nbe discovered among them; but at present we know little or nothing of\r\ntheir contents.\r\n\r\nAt present there are only two names that we can identify with\r\ncertainty as those of persons buried here. Queen Meave, who, as before\r\nmentioned, was transferred from Fert Meave--or Meave's Grave, her first\r\nburying-place, to this Rath, about the end of the first century, and\r\nDathi, at the beginning of the fifth. Whether any other persons were\r\ninterred here before the first-named queen seems doubtful. From the\r\ncontext, it seems as if her being buried in her own Rath had led to its\r\nbeing consecrated to funereal rites, and continuing to be so used till\r\nChristianity induced men to seek burying-places elsewhere than in the\r\ncemeteries of the idolaters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy far the best known, as well as the most interesting, of Irish\r\ncemeteries is that which extends for about two miles east and west on\r\nthe northern bank of the Boyne, about five miles from Drogheda. Within\r\nthis space there remain even now some seventeen sepulchral barrows,\r\nthree of which are pre-eminent.[244] They are now known by the names\r\nof Knowth for the most westward one, Dowth for that to the east, and\r\nabout halfway between these two, that known as New Grange. In front of\r\nthe latter, but lower down nearer the river, is a smaller one, still\r\npopularly known as that of the Dagdha, and others bear names with more\r\nor less certainty; but no systematic exploration of the group has yet\r\nbeen made, so that we are very much in the dark as to their succession,\r\nor who the kings or nobles may be that lie buried within their masses.\r\n\r\nThat at Knowth has never been carefully measured, nor, so far as I\r\nknow, even described in modern times. At a guess, it is a mound 200\r\nfeet in diameter, and 50 to 60 feet in height, with a flat top not\r\nless than 100 feet across. It is entirely composed of small loose\r\nstones, which have been extensively utilized for road making and farm\r\nbuildings, so that the mound has now a very dilapidated appearance,\r\nwhich makes it difficult to ascertain its original form; and so far as\r\nis known, its interior has not been accessible in modern times. Petrie\r\nidentifies it (p. 103) with \"the cave of Cnodhba, which was searched\r\nby the Danes on an occasion (A.D. 862), when the three kings,\r\nAmlaff, Imar, and Auisle, were plundering the territories of Flann, the\r\nson of Conaing. If this is so, its entrance ought not to be difficult\r\nto find, but the prospect of the explorers being rewarded by any\r\ntreasure or object of value is very small indeed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 63. View of Mound at New Grange. From a drawing by\r\nColonel Forbes Leslie.]\r\n\r\nLess than a mile from this one is the larger and more celebrated mound\r\nof New Grange. It is almost certainly one of the three plundered by\r\nthe Danes 1009 years ago. No description of it has anywhere been\r\ndiscovered, prior to the time when Mr. Llwyd, the keeper of the\r\nAshmolean Museum at Oxford, mentioned it in a letter dated Sligo,\r\n1699.[245] He describes the entrance, the passage, and the side\r\nchapels, and the three basins as existing then exactly as they do now,\r\nand does not allude to the discovery of the entrance as being at all\r\nof recent occurrence, though Sir Thomas Molyneux, in 1725, says it\r\nwas found apparently not long before he wrote, in accidently removing\r\nsome stones.[246] The first really detailed account, however, is that\r\nof Governor Pownall, in the second volume of the 'Archæologia' (1770).\r\nHe employed a local surveyor of the name of Bouie to measure it for\r\nhim, but either he must have been a bungler, or the engraver has\r\nmisunderstood his drawings, for it is almost impossible to make out\r\nthe form and dimensions of the mound from the plates published. In the\r\n100 years that have elapsed since his survey was made, the process of\r\ndestruction has been going on rapidly, and it would now require both\r\nskill and patience to restore the monument to its previous dimensions.\r\nMeanwhile the accompanying cuts, partly from Mr. Bouie's plates,\r\npartly from personal observations, may be sufficient for purposes\r\nof illustration, but they are far from pretending to be perfectly\r\naccurate, or such as one would like to see of so important a monument.\r\n\r\nIts dimensions, so far as I can make out, are as follows: it has a\r\ndiameter of 310 to 315 feet for the whole mound, at its junction with\r\nthe natural hill, on which it stands. The height is about 70 feet, made\r\nup of 14 feet for the slope of the hill to the floor of the central\r\nchamber, and 56 feet above it. The angle of external slope appears to\r\nbe 35 degrees, or 5 degrees steeper than Silbury Hill, and consequently\r\nif there is anything in that argument, it may, at least, be a century\r\nor two older. The platform on the top is about 120 feet across,\r\nthe whole being formed of loose stones, with the smallest possible\r\nadmixture of earth and rubbish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 64. New Grange, near Drogheda.]\r\n\r\nAround its base was a circle of large stone monoliths (woodcut No.\r\n63). They stand, according to Sir W. Wilde, 10 yards apart, on a\r\ncircumference of 400 paces, or 1000 feet. If this were so, they were\r\nas nearly as may be 33 feet from centre to centre, and their number\r\nconsequently must originally have been thirty, or the same number as\r\nat Stonehenge. From Bouie's plan I make the number thirty-two, but\r\nthis is hardly to be depended upon. From this disposition it will be\r\nobserved that if the tumulus were removed, or had never been erected,\r\nwe should have here exactly such a circle--333 feet in diameter--as we\r\nfind at Salkeld or at Stanton Drew, and it seems hardly doubtful but\r\nthat such an arrangement as this on the banks of the Boyne gave rise\r\nto those circles which we find on the battle-fields of England two or\r\nthree centuries later. Llwyd, in his letter to Rowland, mentions one\r\nsmaller stone standing on the summit, but that had disappeared, as well\r\nas twenty of the outer circle, when Mr. Bouie's survey was made.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of about 75 feet from the outer edge of the mound, and\r\nat a height of 14 or 15 feet above the level of the stone ring, is the\r\nentrance to the crypt. The threshold stone is 10 feet long by about\r\n18 inches thick, and is richly ornamented by double spirals of a most\r\nelaborate and elegant character;[247] and at a short distance above it\r\nis seen a fragment of a string-course, even more elaborately ornamented\r\nwith a pattern more like modern architecture than anything else on\r\nthese mounds. The passage into the central chamber is, for about 40\r\nfeet, 6 feet high, by 3 feet in width, though both these dimensions\r\nhave been considerably diminished, the first by the accumulation of\r\nearth on the floor, the second by the mass of the mound pressing in the\r\nside walls of the passage, so that it is with difficulty that any one\r\ncan crawl through. Advancing inwards, the roof, which is formed of very\r\nlarge slabs of stone, rapidly becomes higher; and at a distance of 70\r\nfeet from the entrance, rises into a conical dome 20 feet in height,\r\nformed of large masses of stone laid horizontally. The crypt extends\r\nstill 20 feet beyond the centre of the dome; and on the east and west\r\nsides are two other recesses, that in the east being considerably\r\ndeeper than the one opposite to it.\r\n\r\nIn each of these recesses stands a shallow stone basin of oval form 3\r\nfeet by 3 feet 6 or 7 inches across, and 6 to 9 inches deep. They seem\r\nto form an indispensable part of these Irish sepulchres, though what\r\ntheir use was has not yet been ascertained.\r\n\r\nOn one stone in the passage, and on most of those in the inner chamber,\r\nare sculptured ornaments, mostly of the same spiral character as that\r\non the stone at the threshold, but hardly so elaborately or carefully\r\nexecuted. One stone on the right hand angle of the inmost chamber\r\nhas fallen forward (see plan), so that by creeping behind it, it is\r\npossible to see the reverse of some of the neighbouring stones, and it\r\nis found that several of these are elaborately carved with the same\r\nspiral ornaments as their fronts, though it is quite impossible that,\r\nsituated as they are, they could have been seen after the mound was\r\nraised. To account for this, some have asserted that they belonged to\r\nan older building before having been used in this; but it hardly seems\r\nnecessary to adopt so violent an hypothesis. It may have been that\r\nthe stones were carved before being used, and at a time when no plans\r\nor drawings existed, may have been found unsuited in size or form for\r\nthe places for which they were first intended, and consequently either\r\nturned round or used elsewhere. Or it may be that as the crypt must\r\nhave been built and tolerably complete before the mound was raised\r\nover it, the king may have had it ornamented externally while in that\r\nstate. Labour was of little value in those days, and it is dangerous to\r\nattempt to account for the caprices of kings in such a state of society\r\nas must then have existed. The identity of the style and character\r\nof the ornaments both on the hidden and the visible parts of these\r\nstones excludes the idea that they were the work of different epochs. A\r\nremoval from an older building implies a desecration and neglect which\r\nmust have been the work of time; and, having regard to their identity,\r\nit is improbable that a time considerable enough would have elapsed\r\nto admit of a building being so desecrated and neglected as that its\r\nstones should be carried away and used elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 65. Ornament at New Grange. From a rubbing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 66. Ornament at New Grange. From a rubbing.]\r\n\r\nThe position of the entrance so much within the outline of the Tumulus,\r\nis a peculiarity at first sight much more difficult to account for.\r\nAs it now stands, it is situated at a distance of about 50 feet\r\nhorizontally within what we have every reason to believe was the\r\noriginal outline of the mound. Not only is there no reason to believe\r\nthat the passage ever extended further, but the ornamented threshold,\r\nand the carved string-course above, and other indications, seem to\r\npoint out that the tumulus had what may be called an architectural\r\nfaçade at this depth. One mode of accounting for this would be to\r\nassume that the original mound was only about 200 feet in diameter at\r\nthe floor level, and that the interior was then accessible, but that\r\nafter the death of the king who erected it, an envelope 50 feet thick\r\nwas added by his successors, forming the broad platform at the top,\r\nand effectually closing and hiding the entrance to the sepulchre. If\r\nthis were so, we may easily fancy that many of his family, or of his\r\nfollowers, were buried in this envelope, and formed the secondary but\r\nnearly contemporary interments which are so frequently found in English\r\nmounds. The experience of Minning Lowe (woodcut No. 33), Rose Hill\r\n(woodcut No. 39), and other English tumuli, goes far to countenance\r\nsuch an hypothesis; and there is much besides to be said in its\r\nfavour, but it is one of those questions which can only be answered\r\nsatisfactorily by a careful examination of the mound itself. Meanwhile,\r\nhowever, I am rather inclined to adopt the hypothesis that the mound\r\nhad a funnel-shaped entrance like Park Cwn tumulus (woodcut No. 46),\r\nand that at Plas Newydd (woodcut No. 47), and shown in dotted lines\r\nin the woodcut No. 64. The reason for this will be more apparent when\r\nwe come to examine the Lough Crew tumuli, but the apparent ease with\r\nwhich Amlaff and his brother Danes seem to have robbed these tombs in\r\nthe ninth century, seems to indicate that the entrances were not then\r\ndifficult to find.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 67. Branch at New Grange. From a rubbing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 68. Sculptured mark at New Grange, of undecided\r\ncharacter.]\r\n\r\nThe ornaments which cover the walls of the chambers at New Grange are\r\nvery varied, both in their form and character. The most prevalent\r\ndesign is that of spirals variously combined, and often of great\r\nbeauty. They seem always to have been drawn by the hand, never outlined\r\nwith an instrument, and never quite regular either in their form or\r\ncombination. The preceding woodcuts from rubbings give a fair idea\r\nof their general appearance, though many are much more complex, and\r\nsome more carefully cut. The most extensive, and perhaps also the\r\nmost beautiful, is that on the external doorstep.[248] These spirals\r\nare, however, seldom alone, but more frequently are found combined\r\nwith zigzag ornaments, as in (woodcut No. 66), and in lozenge-shaped\r\npatterns; in fact, in every conceivable variety that seemed to suit\r\nthe fancy of the artist, or the shape of the stone he was employed\r\nupon. In one instance a vegetable form certainly was intended. There\r\nmay be others, but this one most undoubtedly represents either a palm\r\nbranch or a fern; my impression is that it is the former, though how a\r\nknowledge of the Eastern plant reached New Grange is by no means clear.\r\nOne other example of the sculptures is worth quoting, if not for its\r\nbeauty, at least for its interest (woodcut No. 68). It is drawn full\r\nsize in the second volume of the 'Archæologia,' p. 238, and Governor\r\nPownall, after a learned disquisition, concludes that the characters\r\nare Phœnician but only numerals (p. 259). General Vallancey and\r\nothers have not been so modest; but one thing seems quite clear, that\r\nit is not a character in any alphabet now known. Still it can hardly\r\nbe a mere ornament. It must be either a mason's mark, or a recognizable\r\nsymbol of some sort, something to mark the position of the stone on\r\nwhich it is engraved, or its ownership by some person. Similar marks\r\nare found in France, but seem there equally devoid of any recognizable\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 69. Chambers in Mound at Dowth. From a MS. plan.]\r\n\r\nThe third of these great tumuli on the Boyne is known as that of Dowth.\r\nDubhad if Petrie is right in identifying it with the third sepulchre\r\nplundered by the Danes in 862. It was dug into by a Committee of the\r\nRoyal Irish Academy in 1847, but without any satisfactory results. A\r\ngreat gash was made in its side to its centre, which has fearfully\r\ndisfigured its form,[249] but without any central chamber being\r\nreached; but on the western side a small entrance was discovered\r\nleading to a passage which extended 40 feet 6 inches (from A to D)\r\ntowards the interior. At the distance of 28 feet from the entrance it\r\nformed a small domical chamber, with three branches, very like that at\r\nNew Grange, but on a smaller scale. In the centre of this apartment was\r\none large flat basin (L), similar in form, and, no doubt, in purpose,\r\nto the three at New Grange, but far larger, being 5 feet by 3 feet. The\r\nsouthern branch of the chamber extends to K in a curvilinear form for\r\nabout 28 feet, where it is stopped for the present by a large stone,\r\nand another partially obstructs the passage at 8 feet in front of the\r\nterminal stone.\r\n\r\nThe Academy have not yet published any account of their diggings, nor\r\ndoes any plan of the mound exist, so far as I know, anywhere. Even its\r\ndimensions are unknown. Pending these being ascertained, it does look\r\nas if this chamber was in an envelope similar to that just suggested\r\nas having existed at New Grange. In that case the original tumulus was\r\nprobably 120 feet in diameter, and with its envelope 200 feet.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the chambers of this tomb are even more richly and\r\nelaborately ornamented than those of the chambers at New Grange, and\r\nare in a more delicate style of workmanship. Altogether I should be\r\ninclined to consider it as more modern than its more imposing rival.\r\n\r\nOne other small tumulus of the cemetery is open. It is situated in\r\nthe grounds of Netterville House. It is, however, only a miniature\r\nrepetition of the central chambers of its larger compeers, but without\r\nsculptures or any other marked peculiarity.\r\n\r\nThe mound called the Tomb of the Dagdha and the ten or twelve others\r\nwhich still exist in this cemetery, are all, so far as is known,\r\nuntouched, and still remain to reward the industry of the first\r\nexplorer. If the three large mounds are those plundered by the Danes,\r\nwhich seems probable, this is sufficient to account for the absence of\r\nthe usual sepulchral treasures, but it by no means follows that the\r\nothers would be equally barren of results. On the contrary, there being\r\nno tradition of their having been opened, and no trace of wounds in\r\ntheir sides, we are led to expect that they may be intact, and that the\r\nbones and armour of the great Dagdha may still be found in his honoured\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nNothing was found in the great mounds at New Grange and Dowth which\r\nthrows much additional light either on their age or the persons to\r\nwhom they should be appropriated. Two skeletons are said to have been\r\ndiscovered at New Grange, but under what circumstances we are not told,\r\nand we do not consequently know whether to consider them as original\r\nor secondary interments. The finding of the coin of Valentinian is\r\nmentioned by Llwyd in 1699, but he merely says that they were found\r\non the top, or rather, as might be inferred, near the top, when it\r\nwas uncovered by the removal of the stones for road-making and such\r\npurposes. Had it been found in the cell, as at Minning Low, it would\r\nhave given us a date, beyond which we could not ascend, but when and\r\nunder what circumstances the coin of Theodosius was found, does not\r\nappear, nor what has become of either. A more important find was made\r\nby Lord Albert Cunyngham in 1842. Some workmen who were employed to dig\r\non the mound near the entrance discovered two splendid gold torques,\r\na brooch, and a gold ring, and with them a gold coin of Geta[250]\r\n(205-212 A.D.). A similar gold ring was found about the same\r\ntime in the cell, and is in the possession of Mrs. Caldwell, the wife\r\nof the proprietor. Although we might feel inclined to hesitate about\r\nthe value of the conclusions to be drawn from the first discovery of\r\ncoins, this additional evidence seems to be conclusive. Three Roman\r\ncoins found in different parts, at different times, and with the\r\ntorques and rings, are, it seems, quite sufficient to prove that it\r\ncannot have been erected before 380, while the probable date for its\r\ncompletion may be about 400 A.D. It may, however, have been\r\nbegun fifty or sixty years earlier. It is most likely that such a tomb\r\nas this was commenced by the king whose remains it was destined to\r\ncontain; but the mound would not be heaped over the chamber till the\r\nking himself, and probably his wives and sons, were laid there, and a\r\nconsiderable period may consequently have elapsed between the inception\r\nand the completion of such a monument.\r\n\r\nAt Dowth there was the usual miscellaneous assortment of things. A\r\ngreat quantity of globular stone-shot, probably sling-stones; and\r\nin the chamber fragments of burned bones, many of which proved to\r\nbe human; glass and amber beads of unique shape, portions of jet\r\nbracelets, a curious stone button, a fibula, bone bodkins, copper pins,\r\nand iron knives and rings. Some years ago a gentleman residing in the\r\nneighbourhood cleared out a portion of the passage, and found a few\r\niron antiquities, some bones of mammals, and a small stone urn, which\r\nhe presented to the Irish Academy.[251] In so far as negative evidence\r\nis of value, it may be remarked that no flint implements and nothing\r\nof bronze--unless the copper pins are so classed--was found in any of\r\nthese tumuli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 70. Ornament in Dowth. From a rubbing.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 71. Ornament in Dowth. From a rubbing.]\r\n\r\nThe ornaments found inside the chambers at Dowth are similar in general\r\ncharacter to those at New Grange, but, on the whole, more delicate and\r\nrefined. Assuming the progressive nature of Irish art, which I see no\r\nreason for doubting, they would indicate a more modern age, and this,\r\nfrom other circumstances, seems more than probable. Though spirals are\r\nfrequent, the Dowth ornaments assume more of free-traced vegetable\r\nforms. It is not so easy to identify the figures in the annexed woodcut\r\n(No. 70), as in the palm-branch in New Grange (woodcut No. 67), but\r\nthere can be little doubt that the intention was to simulate vegetable\r\nnature. At other times forms are introduced which a fanciful antiquary\r\nmight suppose were intended for serpents, or writing, or, at all\r\nevents, as having some occult meaning. The annexed from a rubbing is\r\ncurious, as something very similar occurs on a stone at Coilsfield,\r\nin Ayrshire, and may really be intended to suggest an idea, but of\r\nwhat nature we are not yet in a position to guess. It is not so like\r\nan alphabetical character as those at New Grange (woodcut No. 68),\r\nand till that is shown to have a meaning, it is hardly worth while\r\nspeculating with regard to this one. We shall be in a better position\r\nto judge of the value or importance of these ornaments, in an artistic\r\nor chronometric point of view, when we have examined those at Lough\r\nCrew and elsewhere; but even irrespectively of such considerations,\r\nno one can examine the monuments on the banks of the Boyne without\r\nbeing struck with the elegance as well as the endless variety of the\r\nornaments which cover their walls.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the material proofs are deficient, the written evidence is\r\nclearer and more satisfactory than with regard to any group of tombs\r\nin the three kingdoms. In the passage above quoted, it is said \"that\r\nthey\"--the kings of Ireland--\"were interred at Brugh from the time\r\nof Crimthann (A.D. 76) to the time of Leoghaire, the son of\r\nNiall (A.D. 458), except three persons, namely, Art the son of\r\nConn, and Cormac the son of Art, and Niall of the nine hostages,\"--the\r\nfather of Leoghaire. The reason given why Art and Cormac were not\r\nburied here was that they had embraced Christianity. Art was buried at\r\na place called Treoit; Cormac on the right bank of the Boyne at a place\r\ncalled Ros-na-righ, opposite Brugh; and Niall at Ochaim. But having\r\ndisposed of these three, we have still some twenty-seven kings to find\r\ngraves for, and only seventeen mounds can now be traced at Brugh; and,\r\nbesides these, we have to find the tombs of the Dagdha, and his three\r\nsons, and Etan the poetess and her son Corpre, and Boinn, the wife of\r\nNechtan, \"who took with her to the tomb her small hound Dabilla,\" and a\r\nvast number of nobles of Tuatha de Danann and others. It is impossible\r\nto find places for all these persons in the graves now visible, if\r\neach was buried separately. It may be, however, that the great mounds\r\ncontained several sepulchres. The form and position of the chambers at\r\nDowth (woodcut No. 69) perhaps countenances such a supposition; but\r\nmany may have been buried under smaller cairns, long since removed to\r\nmake way for agricultural improvements, and many may yet be discovered\r\nif the place be carefully and systematically explored, which does not\r\nyet seem to have been done. Before, however, anything like certainty\r\ncould be arrived at as to the distribution of these graves, it would\r\nbe necessary that the great mounds should be thoroughly explored, and\r\nthis, from the nature of their material, will practically involve their\r\ndestruction, which would be very much to be regretted. Meanwhile, if\r\nI may be allowed to offer a conjecture, I would say that New Grange\r\nmight be the \"Cumot or Commensurate grave of Cairbre Lifeachair.\" He,\r\naccording to the Four Masters, reigned from 271 to 288--but probably\r\nfifty or sixty years later--and seems to have been a king deserving of\r\na right royal sepulchre; and I feel great confidence that the unopened\r\ntumulus near the river may be what tradition says it is--the grave of\r\nthe Great Dagdha, the hero of Moytura. With regard to the others, it\r\nwould not be safe to hazard any opinion in the present state of our\r\nknowledge. For the present it is sufficient to feel sure that we have a\r\ngroup of monuments all, or very nearly all of which were erected in the\r\nfirst four centuries of the Christian era, and from this basis we may\r\nreason with tolerable certainty regarding the other groups which we may\r\nmeet with in the course of this enquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOUGH CREW.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of twenty-five miles nearly due west from Brugh na\r\nBoinn, and two miles south-east from Oldcastle, is a range of hills,\r\ncalled on the Ordnance map Slieve na Calliagh--the hags' or witches'\r\nhill. It is upwards of 200 feet above the level of the sea, and the\r\nmost conspicuous elevation in that part of the country. On the ridge\r\nof this range, which is about two miles in extent, are situated from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty cairns, some of considerable size, being 120\r\nto 180 feet in diameter; others are much smaller, and some so nearly\r\nobliterated that their dimensions can hardly be now ascertained. Till\r\nseven or eight years ago this cemetery was entirely unknown to Irish\r\nantiquaries, and the positions of the cairns were hardly even indicated\r\nin the Ordnance Survey; but in 1863 they attracted the attention of\r\nMr. Eugene Conwell, of Trim. In the years 1867-8 he was enabled, with\r\nthe assistance and co-operation of the late Mr. Naper, of Lough Crew,\r\nthe proprietor of the soil, to excavate and explore the whole of them.\r\nA brief account of the results which he obtained was submitted to the\r\nRoyal Irish Academy in 1868, and afterwards printed by him for private\r\ncirculation in 1868; but the greater work, with plans and drawings, in\r\nwhich he intends fully to illustrate the whole, is still in abeyance,\r\nowing to want of encouragement. When completed it will be one of the\r\nmost valuable contributions to our archæological knowledge that we have\r\nreceived of late years. Meanwhile the following meagre particulars are\r\nderived from Mr Conwell's pamphlet and the information I picked up\r\nduring a personal visit which I made to the spot in his company in the\r\nAutumn of last year. The illustrations are all from his drawings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 72. Cairn T, at Lough Crew.--From a plan by E. Conwell.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most perfect of these tumuli is that distinguished by Mr.\r\nConwell as Cairn T (woodcut No. 72). It stands on the highest point of\r\nthe hill, and is consequently the most conspicuous. It is a truncated\r\ncone, 116 feet in diameter at base, and with a sloping side, between 60\r\nand 70 feet in length. Around its base are thirty-seven stones, laid on\r\nedge, and varying from 6 to 12 feet in length. They are not detached,\r\nas at New Grange, but form a retaining wall to the mound. On the north,\r\nand set about 4 feet back from the circle, is a large stone, 10 feet\r\nlong by 6 high, and 2 feet thick, weighing consequently above 10 tons.\r\nThe upper part is fashioned as a rude seat, from which it derives its\r\nname of the Hag's Chair (woodcut No. 73), and there can be little doubt\r\nbut that it was intended as a seat or throne; but whether by the king\r\nwho erected the sepulchre, or for what purpose, it is difficult now to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 73. The Hag's Chair, Lough Crew.--From a drawing by E.\r\nConwell.]\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the mound the stones forming the periphery of\r\nthe cairn curve inwards for eight or nine yards on each side of the\r\nspot where the entrance to the chamber commences. It is of the usual\r\ncruciform plan, and 28 feet long from the entrance to the flat stone\r\nclosing the innermost cell; the dome, consequently, is not nearly\r\nunder the centre of the tumulus, as at New Grange, and lends something\r\nlike probability to the notion that the cell at Dowth (woodcut No.\r\n69), was really the principal sepulchre. Twenty-eight of the stones\r\nin the chamber were ornamented with devices of various sorts. Two of\r\nthem are represented on the accompanying woodcut (No. 74), which, with\r\nthe drawings on the Hag's Chair give a fair idea of their general\r\ncharacter. They are certainly ruder and less artistic than those on\r\nthe Boyne, and so far would indicate an earlier age. Nothing was found\r\nin the chambers of this tomb but a quantity of charred human bones,\r\nperfect human teeth, mixed with the bones of animals, apparently stags,\r\nand one bronze pin, 2½ inches long, with a head ornamented and stem\r\nslightly so, and still preserving a beautiful green polish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 74. Two Stones in Cairn T, Lough Crew.--E. Conwell.]\r\n\r\nCairn L (woodcut No. 75), a little further west, is 135 feet in\r\ndiameter, and surrounded by forty-two stones, similar to those in\r\nCairn T. The same curve inwards of these stones marks the entrance\r\nhere, which is placed 18 feet from the outward line of the circle. The\r\nchamber here is nearly of the same dimensions as that last described,\r\nbeing 29 feet deep and 13 across its greatest width. In one of the side\r\nchambers lies the largest of the mysterious flat basins that have yet\r\nbeen discovered, 5 feet 9 inches long by 3 feet 1 inch broad, the whole\r\nbeing tooled and picked with as much care and skill as if executed\r\nby a modern mason. This one has a curious nick in its rim, but as it\r\ndoes not go through, it could hardly be intended as a spout. Till some\r\nunrifled tomb is found, or something analogous in other countries, it\r\nis extremely difficult to say what the exact use of these great stone\r\nsaucers may have been. That the body or ashes were laid on them is more\r\nthan probable, and they may then have been covered over with a lid like\r\na dish-cover, such as are found on tombs in Southern Babylonia.[252]\r\nUnder this basin were found great quantities of charred human bones\r\nand forty-eight human teeth, besides a perfectly rounded syenite\r\nball, still preserving its original polish, also some jet and other\r\nornaments. In other parts were found quantities of charred bones, some\r\nrude pottery and bone implements, but no objects in metal. The woodcut\r\nrepresenting the cell, with large basin, gives a fair idea of the\r\ngeneral style of sculpture in this and the neighbouring cairns. The\r\nparts cross-hatched seem to have been engraved with a sharp metal tool.\r\nThe ordinary forms, however, both here and on the Boyne are picked;\r\nbut whether they were executed with a hammer, or pick direct, or by a\r\nchisel driven by a hammer, is by no means clear. My own impression is,\r\nthat it would be very difficult indeed to execute these patterns with a\r\nhammer of any sort, and that a chisel must have been used, but whether\r\nof flint, bronze, or iron, there is no evidence to show.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 75. Cell in Cairn L, at Lough Crew.--E. Conwell.]\r\n\r\nCairn H, though only between 5 and 6 feet in height and 54 feet in\r\ndiameter, seems to have been the only one on the hill not previously\r\nrifled, and yielded a most astonishing collection of objects to its\r\nexplorer. The cell was of the usual cruciform plan, 24 feet from the\r\nentrance to the rear, and 16 feet across the lateral chambers. In\r\nthe passage and crypts of this cairn Mr. Conwell collected some 300\r\nfragments of human bones, which must have belonged to a considerable\r\nnumber of separate individuals; 14 fragments of rude pottery, 10 pieces\r\nof flint, 155 sea-shells in a perfect condition, besides pebbles and\r\nsmall polished stones, in quantities.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable part of the collection consisted of 4884 fragments,\r\nmore or less perfect, of bone implements. These are now in the\r\nDublin Museum, and look like the remains of a paper-knife-maker's\r\nstock-in-trade. Most of them are of a knife shape, and almost all more\r\nor less polished, but without further ornamentation; but 27 fragments\r\nappear to have been stained, 11 perforated, 501 engraved with rows of\r\nfine lines; 13 combs were engraved on both sides, and 91 engraved by\r\ncompass with circles and curves of a high order of art. On one, in\r\ncross-hatch lines, is the representation of an antlered stag, the only\r\nattempt to depict a living thing in the collection.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there were found in this cairn seven beads of amber,\r\nthree small beads of glass of different colours, two fragments, and\r\na curious molten drop of glass, 1 inch long, trumpet-shaped at one\r\nend, and tapering towards the other extremity; six perfect and eight\r\nfragments of bronze rings, and seven specimens of iron implements, but\r\nall, as might be expected, very much corroded by rust. One of these\r\npresents all the appearance of being the leg of a compass, with which\r\nthe bone implements may have been engraved, and one was an iron punch,\r\n5 inches long, with a chisel-shaped point, bearing evidence of the use\r\nof the mallet at the opposite end.\r\n\r\nCairn D is the largest and most important monument of the group, being\r\n180 feet in diameter, and though it is very much dilapidated, the\r\ncircle of fifty-four stones which originally surrounded it can still\r\nbe traced. On its eastern side the stones curve inwards for about\r\ntwelve paces, in the form universal in these cairns; but though the\r\nexplorers set to work industriously to follow out what they considered\r\na sure \"find,\" they could not penetrate the mound. The stones fell\r\nin upon them so fast, and the risk they ran was so great, that they\r\nwere forced to abandon the idea of tunnelling, and though a large body\r\nof men worked assiduously for a fortnight trying to work down from\r\nabove, they failed to penetrate to the central or any other chambers.\r\nIt still, therefore, remains a mystery if there is a blind tope, like\r\nmany in India, or whether its secret still remains to reward some\r\nmore fortunate set of explorers. If it has no central chamber, the\r\ncurving inwards of its outer circle of stones is a curious instance of\r\nadherence to a sacred form.\r\n\r\nThe other monuments on the hill do not present any features worth\r\nenumerating in a general summary like the present, though they would\r\nbe most interesting in a monograph. Though differing greatly in size\r\nand in richness of ornamentation, they all belong to one class,\r\nand apparently to one age. For our present purpose one of the most\r\ninteresting peculiarities is that, like the group on the banks of\r\nthe Boyne, this is essentially a cemetery. There are no circles, no\r\nalignments, no dolmens, no rude stone monuments, in fact. All are\r\ncarefully built, and all more or less ornamented; and there is a\r\ngradation and progression throughout the whole series widely different\r\nin this respect from the simplicity and rudeness of the English\r\nmonuments described in the last chapter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt now only remains to try to ascertain who those were who were buried\r\nin these tumuli, and when they were laid there to their rest. So far as\r\nthe evidence at present stands it hardly seems to me to admit of doubt\r\nbut that this is the cemetery of Talten, so celebrated in Irish legend\r\nand poetry:--\r\n\r\n  \"The host of Great Meath are buried\r\n  In the middle of the Lordly Brugh;\r\n  The Great Ultonians used to bury\r\n  At Talten with pomp.\r\n\r\n  \"The true Ultonians, before Conchobar,\r\n  Were ever buried at Talten,\r\n  Until the death of that triumphant man,\r\n  Through which they lost their glory.\"[253]\r\n\r\nThe distance of the spot from Telltown, the modern representative of\r\nTalten, is twelve miles, which to some might appear an objection, but\r\nit must be remembered that Brugh is ten miles from Tara, where all\r\nthe kings resided, who were buried there; and as Dathi and others of\r\nthem were buried at Rath Croghan, sixty-five miles off, distance seems\r\nhardly to be an objection. Indeed, among a people who, as evidenced\r\nby their monuments, paid so much attention to funeral rites and\r\nceremonious honours to their dead, as the Pagan Irish evidently did,\r\nit must have mattered little whether the last resting-place of one of\r\ntheir kings was a few miles nearer or further from his residence.\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be forgotten, that the proper residence of the\r\nUltonians, who are said to have been buried at Talten, was Emania or\r\nArmagh, forty-five miles distant as the crow flies. Why they should\r\nchoose to be buried in Meath, so near the rival capital of Tara, if\r\nthat famed city then existed, is a mystery which it is not easy to\r\nsolve; but that it was so, there seems no doubt, if the traditions\r\nor Books of the Irish are at all to be depended upon. If their real\r\nresidence was so distant, it seems of trifling consequence whether it\r\nwas ten or twelve miles from the place we now know as Telltown. There\r\nmust have been some very strong reason for inducing the Ultonians to\r\nbury so far from their homes; but as that reason has not been recorded,\r\nit is idle to attempt to guess what form it took. What would appear\r\na most reasonable suggestion to a civilized Saxon in the nineteenth\r\ncentury would in all probability be the direct antithesis of the motive\r\nthat would guide an uncivilized Celt in the first century before\r\nChrist, and we may therefore as well give up the attempt. Some other\r\nreason than that of mere proximity to the place of residence governed\r\nthe Irish in the choice of the situation of their cemeteries; what that\r\nwas we may hereafter be able to find out,--at present, so far as I\r\nknow, the materials do not exist for forming an opinion. If, however,\r\nthis is not Talten, no graves have been found nearer Telltown, which\r\nwould at all answer to the descriptions that remains to us of this\r\ncelebrated cemetery; and, till they are found, these Lough Crew mounds\r\nseem certainly entitled to the distinction. I cannot see that the\r\nmatter is doubtful.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, there is little difficulty in determining who were\r\nburied here. Besides the testimony of the poem just quoted, it is\r\nstated in the Book of the 'Cemeteries'--\"At Tailten the kings of Ulster\r\nwere used to bury vig^t. Ollamh Fodhla with his descendants down to\r\nConchobhar, who wished to be carried to a place between Slea and the\r\nsea, with his face to the east, on account of the faith which he had\r\nembraced.\" This conversion of Conchobhar is one of the most famous\r\nlegends in Irish ancient history. He was wounded in the head by a ball\r\nthat remained there, and was ordered by his physician to remain quiet\r\nand avoid all excitement as his only chance of surviving. For seven\r\nyears he followed this advice; but when he saw the eclipse of the sun,\r\nand felt the great convulsion that came over nature, the day that\r\nChrist was crucified, he turned to his Druid and asked, \"What is this?\"\r\nTo which Bacrach, the Druid, replied: \"It is true, indeed, Christ, the\r\nSon of God, is this day crucified by the Jews.\" \"At the recital of\r\nthis enormity, Conchobhar felt so indignant that he went nearly mad:\r\nhis excitement was so great that the ball burst from his head, and he\r\ndied on the very Friday on which the crucifixion took place.\"[254] All\r\nthis may be silly enough, as the electric telegraph was not then in\r\nuse, but it is worth quoting here, as it seems that it was to establish\r\nthis synchronism that the chronology of the period was falsified to\r\nthe extent of half a century at least. Conchobhar and Crimthann were\r\nthe two kings of the two great dynasties then reigning in Ireland\r\nwhom the annalists strive to synchronize with Christ, and though they\r\nfail in that, they establish beyond much doubt that those kings were\r\ncontemporaries. If to this we add the fact so often repeated by the\r\nauthorities quoted above, that Conchobhar was the last of his race\r\nburied at Talten, and that Crimthann was the first of his line buried\r\nat Brugh, we obtain a tolerably clear idea of the history of these\r\ncemeteries. Brugh, in fact, succeeded to Talten on the decline of the\r\nUltonian dynasty and the rise of Tuatha de Danann after the victories\r\nat Moytura had established their supremacy and they had settled\r\nthemselves at Tara.\r\n\r\nThe character of the sculptures in the two groups of monuments fully\r\nbears out this view. The carvings at Lough Crew are ruder and less\r\nartistic than those at Brugh. They are more disconnected, and oftener\r\nmere cup markings. The three stones represented in the preceding and\r\nfollowing woodcuts (Nos. 75 and 76), are selected from a great many\r\nin the Conwell portfolios as fair average specimens of the style\r\nof sculpture common at Lough Crew, and with the woodcut No. 73,\r\nrepresenting the Hag's Chair, and No. 75, the chamber in cairn L,\r\nwill convey a fair notion of the whole. In no one instance does it\r\nseem possible to guess what these figures were meant to represent.\r\nNo animal or vegetable form can be recognized, even after allowing\r\nthe utmost latitude to the imagination; nor do the circles or waving\r\nlines seem intended to convey any pictorial ideas. Beauty of form, as\r\na decoration, seems to have been all the old Celt aimed at, and he may\r\nhave been thought successful at the time, though it hardly conveys the\r\nsame impression to modern minds. The graceful scrolls and spirals and\r\nthe foliage of New Grange and Dowth do not occur there, nor anything\r\nin the least approaching to them. Indeed, when Mr. Conwell's book is\r\npublished, in which they will all be drawn in more or less detail, I\r\nbelieve it will be easy to arrange the whole into a progressive series\r\nillustrative of the artistic history of Ireland for five centuries\r\nbefore the advent of St. Patrick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 76. Stone in Cairn T. Lough Crew.--E. Conwell.]\r\n\r\nIt would be an extremely dangerous line of argument to apply this law\r\nof progressive development to all countries. In India, especially, it\r\nis very frequently reversed. The rudest art is often much more modern\r\nthan the most refined, but in Ireland this apparently never was the\r\ncase. From the earliest scratchings on pillar stones, down to the\r\nEnglish conquest, her art seems to have been unfalteringly progressive;\r\nand, beginning with these two cemeteries, which are probably the oldest\r\nincunabula of her art, its history might be written without a gap, or\r\nhalt, till it bloomed in those exquisite manuscripts and crosses and\r\nworks of gold and metal which still excite such unqualified admiration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 77. Stones in Sculptured Graves, Clover Hill. From a\r\nsketch by the Author.]\r\n\r\nThere may be, and no doubt are, many other sculptured graves\r\nin Ireland, but they have not yet been explored, or, at least,\r\npublished. One, however, deserves notice; not, certainly, on account\r\nof its magnificence, but for several points of interest which its\r\npeculiarities bring out. It is situated in a field near Clover Hill,\r\nnot far from Carrowmore, the battle-field of northern Moytura.[255]\r\nIt measures only 7 feet by 5, and is 4½ feet deep. Its cap-stone\r\nwas originally flush with the earth, and no cairn or circle of stones\r\nmarks it externally, nor is there any tradition of any such ever\r\nhaving existed. The carvings on the stones forming the chamber are\r\nshallow, and now very indistinct, from being overgrown with lichens\r\nand moss, but their general character will be understood from the\r\nannexed woodcut. Its character is something between the sculptures\r\nof Talten and Brugh, which would agree very well with its date if we\r\nsuppose it connected with the battle-field. This, however, is very\r\ndoubtful, for there are few things that come out more prominently in\r\nthe investigation than the fact that all those monuments which are\r\ndirectly or indirectly connected with battle-fields are literally rude\r\nand untouched by the chisel, but that all, or nearly all those which\r\nare in cemeteries, or have been erected leisurely by, or for, those who\r\noccupy them, are more or less ornamented. It may, however, be that some\r\none connected with the battle wished to be buried near his companions\r\nwho fell there, and prepared this last resting-place for himself, but\r\nwe must know more before such speculations can be of much value.\r\n\r\nOne other point is of interest regarding this tomb. If the minor\r\nsepulchres at Brugh were like the one flush with the surface, we cannot\r\nguess how many may yet be there undiscovered, and equally difficult to\r\nsay how they are to be disinterred.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOLMENS.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely difficult to write anything that will be at all\r\nsatisfactory regarding the few standing solitary dolmens of Ireland.\r\nNot that their history could not be, perhaps, easily ascertained, but\r\nsimply because every one has hitherto been content to consider them as\r\nprehistoric, and no one has consequently given himself the trouble to\r\ninvestigate the matter. The first point would be to ascertain whether\r\nany of them exist on any of the battle-fields mentioned in the Irish\r\nannals. My impression is that they do not: but this question can only\r\nbe answered satisfactorily by some one more intimately acquainted with\r\nthe ancient political geography of Ireland than I can pretend to be.\r\nNo connexion has, however, yet been shown to exist between them and\r\nany known battle-fields, and till this is done, we must be content to\r\nconsider them as the graves of chiefs or distinguished individuals\r\nwhose ashes are contained in the urns which are generally found under\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA still more important question hinges on their geographical\r\ndistribution. Nothing can be more unsafe than to found any important\r\ndeductions on what is known on this subject at present. If all those\r\nwhich are described in books and in journals of learned societies\r\nwere marked on a map, the conclusion would be that the most of them\r\nare found on the east coast of Ireland; a dozen or so in Waterford\r\nand Wexford; as many in Dublin and Meath, and an equal number in\r\nCounty Down. But this knowledge may merely mean that the east coast,\r\npossessing roads and towns, has consequently been more frequented by\r\ntourists and antiquaries than the remote or inaccessible west.\r\n\r\nAmong the records, however, of the Ordnance survey, and in the Du Noyer\r\ndrawings, there are probably sufficient materials for the purpose. Both\r\nare deposited in the Library of the Royal Irish Academy at Dublin;\r\nbut any person who would attempt to use these materials for the\r\npurpose of such an investigation, must be not only an enthusiast, but\r\nhave his whole time at his disposal. The disarray in which they now\r\nexist renders them utterly useless to any ordinary student of Irish\r\nantiquities.\r\n\r\nThe Irish themselves seem to have only one tradition regarding their\r\ndolmens. They call them all \"Beds of Diarmid and Graine,\" and that is\r\nthe name applied to them in the sheets of the Ordnance Survey. The\r\nelopement of Diarmid with Graine, the daughter of Cormac Mac Art,\r\nwhose date, according to the Four Masters, was A.D. 286, is\r\none of the most celebrated of Irish legends.[256] The story is, that\r\nbeing pursued all over Ireland by Finn, the disappointed suitor, they\r\nerected these as places of shelter, or for hiding in. This is, of\r\ncourse, absurd enough; but it shows that, in the opinion of the Irish\r\nthemselves, they belong to the period which elapsed between the birth\r\nof Christ and the conversion of the people to Christianity. There is\r\nno hint in any Irish book that any of them were erected before the\r\nChristian era, nor anything that would lead us to suppose that any are\r\nmore modern than the time of St. Columba.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive group of free standing dolmens known to exist in\r\nIreland, is that in or near Glen Columbkille, at the extreme western\r\npoint of Donegal. No account of these has been published--so far as I\r\nknow--in any book or journal, and I am indebted for all I know about\r\nthem to my friend, Mr. Norman Moore, who paid a visit to the spot\r\nthis autumn to obtain the information I wanted, and it is from his\r\ndescriptions that the following is abstracted.[257]\r\n\r\nThe principal groups are situated in Glen Malin More, a small valley\r\nrunning parallel to that of Columbkille, about two miles to the\r\nsouthward of it. There are three groups on the north side of this\r\nvalley and two on the south, extending from about half a mile from\r\nthe sea-shore to about three miles inward. The finest group is that\r\nnext the sea on the south side, and consists of six dolmens, situated\r\nnearly in a row, about 50 or 100 feet apart, and is accompanied by\r\nsome cairns, but so small as hardly to deserve the name of Tumuli. The\r\nstones of the dolmens range from 6 to 12 feet in height, and their\r\ncap-stones are still there, though some have been displaced.\r\n\r\nThe second group, a little way up the glen, consists of ten dolmens\r\narranged in two parallel rows, but they are neither so large nor so\r\nperfect as those nearer to the sea.\r\n\r\nNearly opposite the first-named group on the shore, but on the north\r\nside of the stream, are two dolmens so nearly contiguous to each\r\nother that they may almost be considered as one structure. About half\r\na mile to the east of this is a fourth group, consisting of four\r\ndolmens, accompanied by cairns, and two at least of the former are of\r\nconsiderable magnificence. The group farthest up the glen consists of\r\nfive or six dolmens, but all except one in a ruinous state.\r\n\r\nThe number of dolmens in Glen Columbkille is not given by Mr. Moore;\r\nbut, from the context, there must be five or six, making up twenty\r\nto thirty for the whole group. So far as can be judged from the\r\ndescription, the group in Glen Columbkille seems to have better fitted\r\nand more complete chambers; consequently, I should infer it to be more\r\nmodern than the others. It would, however, require careful personal\r\ninspection to classify them; though I have no doubt it could be done,\r\nand that, with a little care, these six groups could be arranged into a\r\nconsecutive series, whatever the initial or final date may turn out to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThe general construction and appearance of these tombs is that of\r\nthe so-called Calliagh Birra's house in Meath, described further on\r\n(woodcut No. 80). From its situation and appearance, there seems little\r\nreason for doubt that the Meath example belongs to the fifth or the\r\nsixth century; and if this is so, as little for doubting that these\r\ndolmens in Donegal are of about the same age, or, in other words, that\r\nthis mode of interment continued to be practised in certain parts of\r\nIreland, especially near the coasts, down to the entire conversion of\r\nthe inhabitants to Christianity.\r\n\r\nThere are no other traditions, so far as I know, attached to anything\r\nin this glen, except those that relate to St. Columba, who, it is\r\nunderstood, long resided here, attempting to convert the inhabitants\r\nto Christianity. Whether he was successful or not is not clear. He\r\ncertainly left Ireland in disgust, and settled in the first island\r\nwhence the shores of his detested native land could not be seen. The\r\nonly other tradition that seems to bear on the subject relates to\r\nSt. Patrick, who, being unable to convert the \"Demons\" about Croagh\r\nPatrick, in Mayo, drove them into the sea; but, instead of perishing,\r\nas they ought to have done, when he threw his bell after them, they\r\nreappeared, and settled on this promontory.[258] The meaning of this\r\nfable seems to be, that some tribe--not Celtic, for the Celts accepted\r\nChristianity whenever and wherever it was preached to them, but, it may\r\nbe of Iberian origin--refusing to accept the doctrine, was expelled\r\nby force from their seats in Mayo, and sought refuge with kindred\r\ntribes in this remote corner of the island, and here remained till\r\nSt. Columba took up his abode among them. If we might assume that\r\nthe Columbkille group belongs to a time immediately preceding their\r\nconversion, and that the other five groups in Malin More extended back\r\nto a date two, three, it may be four centuries before St. Columba's\r\ntime, and that they belonged to an Iberian or Celtiberian race, we\r\nshould have an hypothesis which at least would account for all their\r\npeculiarities. Though in sight of Carrowmore, on the southern side of\r\nSligo Bay, it is certain that these monuments have no affinity with\r\nthem or with the works of any of the Northern circle-building nations.\r\nSpanish or French they must be; and we can hardly hesitate between the\r\ntwo. In Elizabeth's time, and as far back as history reaches, we have\r\nSpaniards settled in Galway, and on the western coast of Ireland. Such\r\ncolonisation, if lasting, is not the work of any sudden impulse or of\r\na long past time; and the probability is that Iberians, before they\r\nlearned to talk Latin, were settled here from a very early age. It\r\nis also probable from what we know of them and their monuments in the\r\nPeninsula, that they would refuse for a longer period than the Celts to\r\nbe converted, and that they should use dolmens for their sepulchres in\r\npreference either to tumuli or circles.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, there are at least two points which we may assume\r\nnegatively with regard to these dolmens. The first is, that they do not\r\nmark battle-fields: they have none of the appearance of such monuments.\r\nThe second is, that as there is no capital or fertile country in their\r\nneighbourhood, they are not a royal cemetery; they are not, indeed,\r\nclaimed, even in the remotest manner, by any of the royal races of\r\nIreland. They are, so far as we can see, the sepulchres of a foreign\r\ncolony settled on this spot. Whether this is probable or not must,\r\nof course, depend on a comparison of these monuments with those in\r\nthe countries from which they are supposed to have come. But, in the\r\nmeanwhile, it may be assumed, as an hypothesis which at least accounts\r\nfor the phenomena as we find them in Ireland, even when judged of by\r\ntheir own internal evidence alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of the Irish dolmens is that known as the\r\nGiant's Grave, near Drumbo, about four miles south from Belfast. The\r\ninterest attached to this monument does not, however, arise so much\r\nfrom the grandeur of the structure itself, though it may be considered\r\na first-class example and very tolerably perfect, but from its standing\r\nsolitary in the centre of the largest circle in these islands,\r\nAvebury only excepted. The circle is about 580 feet in diameter, and\r\nconsequently more than six acres in extent, and is formed, not as at\r\nAvebury or Arbor Low, by a ditch dug inside, and the earth so gained\r\nbeing used to form a rampart, but by the top of a hill being levelled\r\nand the earth removed in so doing being thrown up so as to form a\r\ncircular amphitheatre. Although, consequently, the rampart is not so\r\nhigh outside as at Avebury, the whole surface internally having been\r\nlowered, the internal effect is very much grander.[259]\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the object of this great earthwork with one solitary\r\ndolmen in the centre? Was it simply the converse of such a mound as\r\nthat at New Grange? Was it that, instead of heaping the earth over the\r\nsepulchral chamber, they cleared it away and arranged it round it, so\r\nas to give it dignity? Or was it that funereal games or ceremonies were\r\ncelebrated round the tomb, and that the amphitheatre was prepared to\r\ngive dignity to their performance? These are questions that can only\r\nbe answered when more of these circles are known and compared with one\r\nanother, and the whole subject submitted to a more careful examination\r\nthan has yet been the case. My impression is that it is the grave of\r\na chief, and of him only, and that it is among the most modern of its\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nAt about the same distance west from Belfast is another dolmen, which,\r\nin itself, is a much finer example than this Grave of the Giant. Its\r\ncap-stone is said to weigh 40 tons, and is supported by five upright\r\nstones of considerable dimensions. It has, however, no circle or\r\naccompaniments. The Celtic name of the district in which it stands was\r\n'Baille clough togal,' _i.e._ the Town of the Stone of the Strangers,\r\nwhich would seem to indicate that it was not very old, nor its origin\r\nquite forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 78. Dolmen at Knockeen.]\r\n\r\nAt Knockeen, county Waterford, there is a remarkable dolmen (woodcut\r\nNo. 78), though it neither has any surroundings nor any tradition\r\nattached to it.[260] It is interesting, however, as it looks as if\r\nwe were approaching the form out of which Stonehenge grew, which, I\r\nhave not a doubt, could be found in Ireland if looked for. It is also\r\ninteresting as showing in plan (woodcut No. 79), an arrangement which\r\nis peculiar, I believe, to Irish dolmens. The cell is well formed, but\r\nin front of it is a demicell, or ante-chamber, which looks as if it\r\nmight have been used for making offerings to the dead after the cell\r\nwas closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 79. Plan of Dolmen at Knockeen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 80. Calliagh Birra's House, north end of Parish of\r\nMonasterboice.]\r\n\r\nOne other dolmen deserves being illustrated before going further, as it\r\nbelongs to a class of monuments common in Brittany, hitherto unknown in\r\nGreat Britain. It consists of a cell 12 feet 8 inches long internally,\r\nwith a width of 4 feet at the entrance, but diminishing to 3 feet at\r\nits inner end. It is situated near Monasterboice, at the northern limit\r\nof the parish, and not far, consequently, from New Grange, and close\r\nto Greenmount. Locally it is known as the house or tomb of Calliagh\r\nVera, or Birra,[261] the hag whose chair is illustrated in woodcut No.\r\n73, and whose name is indissolubly connected with the Lough Crew tombs.\r\nAccording to the traditions collected by Dr. O'Donovan and Mr. Conwell,\r\nshe broke her neck before completing the last tumulus, and was buried,\r\nclose to where she died,[262] in the parish of Diarmor, where, however,\r\nnothing remains to mark the spot.\r\n\r\nFrom the mode in which it is constructed, it seems hardly doubtful that\r\nthe original intention was to cover it with a tumulus; but probably it\r\nnever was occupied. If I am correct in my surmise as to its age, its\r\nbuilder may have been converted to Christianity before he had occasion\r\nfor it. But, be that as it may, its exposed position may serve to\r\nexplain how a king or chief who had erected such a structure for his\r\nburying-place might very well have amused himself, if his life were\r\nprolonged, in adorning both the interior and exterior with carvings.\r\nI cannot believe that the internal ornaments were ever executed by\r\nartificial light, and both, therefore, must have been completed before\r\nthe chamber was buried.\r\n\r\nLast year, General Lefroy excavated a tumulus at Greenmount, Castle\r\nBellingham, about five miles north of Calliagh Birra's so-called\r\nhouse.[263] In it he found a chamber, 21 feet long by about 4 feet wide\r\nand 5 feet high, enclosed by two parallel walls built of small stones,\r\nand closed at each end by similar masonry.\r\n\r\nThe roof was formed of slabs in two rows, the lower projecting as\r\nbrackets and the upper stretching across beyond the walls on each side.\r\nIn plan, therefore, it was identical with the Birra's house, though\r\nlonger and larger. But, from the mode in which it was constructed,\r\nit was evidently more modern,--the most modern, in fact, of all the\r\nchambered sepulchral tumuli yet discovered in Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 81. Plan and Section of Chamber in Greenmount Tumulus.\r\nFrom a drawing by General Lefroy.]\r\n\r\nNothing was found in the chamber: it had been rifled before, but by\r\nwhom and at what period there was nothing to show. At 9 or 10 feet\r\nbelow the summit, but still 6 or 7 feet above the floor of the chamber,\r\na bronze monument was found with a Runic inscription on it, which, with\r\nthe assistance of the Danish antiquaries, the General decides to belong\r\nto the ninth century (852?). The one question is, is it coeval with the\r\nbuilding of the tomb or its destruction? The name Domnal, or Domhnall,\r\nbeing Irish, and the position in which it was found seem to prove that\r\nit belongs to the period of the raising of the mound, not to that of\r\nits being rifled; and if so, this grave approaches the age to which\r\nMaeshowe in the Orkneys may belong.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance, however, which interests us most at present is the\r\nsimilarity of the Greenmount Chamber to the Lady Birra's tomb. Being\r\nlocally so close to one another, and so like in plan, they cannot be\r\nvery distant in date, though the more southern is, from its megalithic\r\ncharacter, undoubtedly the more ancient of the two. If we allow two or\r\nthree centuries it is a long stretch, though even that takes us far\r\naway from any connexion with the monuments at Lough Crew, and barely\r\nallows of it following very close on those at Brugh na Boinne.\r\n\r\nThe similarity of this tomb with those at Glen Columbkille has already\r\nbeen pointed out, and no doubt others exist in Ireland, and will be\r\nbrought to light as soon as attention is directed to the subject. But\r\nmeanwhile they seem, so far as we can at present judge, to make up an\r\nextensive group of pagan or semi-pagan monuments, extending from the\r\ntime of St. Patrick to that of St. Columba, and, as such, are among\r\nthe latest, and certainly among the most interesting, monuments of the\r\nclass in Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 82. Dolmen of the Four Maols, Ballina.]\r\n\r\nVague as all this may probably appear, there is one dolmen in Ireland\r\nwhich seems to have a date. The great grandson of Dathi, whose red\r\npillar-stone at Rath Croghan, erected A.D. 428, we have\r\nalready pointed out, was named Ceallach. He was murdered by his four\r\nfoster-brothers through envy about the sovereignty. They were hanged\r\nfor their crime at a spot known as Ard-na-Riagh, near Ballina, and were\r\nburied on a hill on the opposite side of the river, where a dolmen\r\nstill stands, and is pointed out as the grave of the four Maols, the\r\nmurderers. These particulars are related in the Dinnsenchus, in the\r\nBook of Lecan, and in the Annals of the Hy Fiachrach, translated by Dr.\r\nO'Donovan (p. 35), who, in a note, adds that \"this evidence, coupled\r\nwith the description of the situation on the other side of the Moy,\r\nopposite Ard-na-Riagh, leaves no doubt of its identity.\"\r\n\r\nThe dolmen in question has nothing very remarkable about it. The\r\ncap-stone, which measures 9 feet by 7 feet, is hexagonal in form, and\r\nis supported on three uprights, arranged similarly to those of Kit's\r\nCotty House. It is perfectly level, and stands about 4 feet above\r\nthe level of the soil. The cap-stone may have been fashioned into\r\nits present form by art; but there is no sign of chiselling, and,\r\naltogether there is nothing that would attract especial attention.[264]\r\nThe interest rests with its date. If it can be established that it\r\nbelongs to the beginning of the sixth century, which I see no more\r\nreason for doubting than Dr. O'Donovan does, it is a point gained in\r\nour investigation, in so far at least as dates are concerned.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to enumerate the other dolmens in Ireland which\r\nhave neither dates nor peculiarities to distinguish them from others\r\nof this class, but there is one monument of a megalithic character in\r\nIreland which must be described before leaving the country, though it\r\ncertainly is not a dolmen, and its date and use are both mysterious at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 83. Sketch-Plan of Monument in the Deer Park, Sligo.\r\nScale 40 feet to 1 inch.]\r\n\r\nIt stands in the deer park of the Hazlewood domain, about four miles\r\neast of Sligo. It is entered from the south, and consists first\r\nof an enclosure 54 feet by 24 feet. To the westward of this is a\r\nsmaller apartment, about 30 feet by 12 feet, divided into two by two\r\nprojecting stones. At the east end are two similar apartments side\r\nby side, but smaller, the whole length of the structure measuring\r\nabout 115 feet.[265] The three entrances from the central to the side\r\napartments are trilithons of squared and partially dressed stones, and\r\nwould remind us of Stonehenge, were they not so small. They are only\r\n3 feet under the lintel, and you must bow low indeed to pass under\r\nthem. Indeed, when speaking of these enclosures as apartments, it\r\nmust be borne in mind that one can enter anywhere by passing between\r\nthe stones, and stepping over the walls, which are composed of stones\r\nhardly ever touching each other, the highest being only 3 or 4 feet\r\nhigh. Many of them, though massive, have only half that height.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is this curious edifice? It can hardly be a tomb, it is\r\nso unlike any other tomb which we know of. In plan it looks more like\r\na temple; indeed, it is not unlike the arrangement of some Christian\r\nchurches: but a church or temple with walls pervious, as these are, and\r\nso low that the congregation outside can see all that passes inside,\r\nis so anomalous an arrangement, that it does not seem admissible. At\r\npresent it is unique; if some similar example could be discovered,\r\nperhaps we might guess its riddle.\r\n\r\nIt is situated on the highest plateau of the hill. A little lower\r\ndown is a very fine stone Cathair, or circular fort, with an L-shaped\r\nunderground apartment of some extent in its centre; and on a\r\nneighbouring eminence are several round tumuli, which, looking like the\r\nburying-places of the \"Castellani,\" increase the improbability of the\r\nupper building being a sepulchre.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this branch of the subject, it may be as well to allude\r\nto a point which, though not very distinct in itself, may have some\r\ninfluence with those who are shocked at being told that the rude\r\nstone monuments of Ireland are so modern as from the preceding pages\r\nwe should infer they were. It is that every allusion to Ireland, in\r\nany classical author, and every inference from its own annals, lead\r\nus to assume that Ireland, during the centuries that elapsed between\r\nthe Christian era and St. Patrick, was in a state of utter and\r\nhopeless barbarism. The testimony of Diodorus[266] and Strabo[267]\r\nthat its inhabitants were cannibals is too distinct to be disputed,\r\nand according to the last named authority, they added to this an\r\nugly habit of eating their fathers and mothers. These accusations\r\nare repeated by St. Jerome[268] in the fourth century with more than\r\nnecessary emphasis. All represent the Irish as having all their women\r\nin common, and as more barbarous than the inhabitants of Britain,[269]\r\nindeed, than any other people of Europe. Nor can it be pleaded that\r\nthese authors wrote in ignorance of the state of the country, for\r\nPtolemy's description of the coasts and of the interior, of the cities\r\nand tribes shows an intimate acquaintance with the island which could\r\nonly be derived from observation.[270] Their own annals do not, it\r\nis true, repeat these scandals; but nothing we now have can be said\r\nto have been reduced to writing in anything like the form in which\r\nwe now possess it before the time of St. Patrick; and even that has\r\npassed through edition after edition at the hands of patriotic Irishmen\r\nbefore it assumed the form in which we now find it. Even these tell of\r\nnothing but fighting and assassination, and of crimes of every sort\r\nand kind. Even the highest title of one of their greatest kings, Conn\r\n\"of a hundred battles,\" is sufficiently indicative of the life which\r\nhe led, and the state of the country he governed. As we have every\r\nreason to believe that the progress of Ireland was steadily and equably\r\nprogressive, it is evident that if it was so, a very short time prior\r\nto what we find in the early centuries of Christianity would take us\r\nback to the present state of the natives of Australia, and we should\r\nfind a condition of society when any combined effort was impossible. So\r\nevident is this, not only from history, but from every inference that\r\ncan be gathered from the state of Ireland in subsequent ages, that the\r\nwonder really is how such a people could have erected such monuments\r\nas those we find on the banks of the Boyne in the early centuries of\r\nour epoch. The answer is, of course, that the idleness of savages\r\nis capable of wonderful efforts. A nation of men who have no higher\r\nambition than to provide for their daily wants, and who are willing to\r\nsubmit to any tyrant who will undertake to supply these in order to\r\ngratify his own pride or ambition, may effect wonders. The pyramids\r\nof Egypt and the temples of southern India are examples of what may\r\nbe done by similar means. But to effect such things, the people must\r\nbe sufficiently organised to combine, and sufficiently disciplined to\r\nsubmit; and we have no reason to suppose that in Ireland they were\r\neither before the Christian era, and it is even very difficult to\r\nunderstand how they came to be so far advanced even in the time of St.\r\nPatrick. That they were so their works attest; but if we had to trust\r\nto indications derived from history alone, the inference certainly\r\nwould be that the monuments are considerably more modern than the dates\r\nabove assigned to them; while it seems barely possible they should be\r\ncarried back to any earlier period.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere may be other rude stone monuments in Ireland besides those\r\ndescribed or alluded to in the preceding pages, but they can scarcely\r\nbe very numerous or very important, or they could hardly have escaped\r\nnotice. They are not, consequently, likely to disturb any conclusion\r\nthat may be arrived at from the examination of those which are known.\r\nFrom these, we may safely conclude that all, with perhaps the exception\r\nof the Hazlewood monument, are certainly sepulchral; and all, unless\r\nI am very much mistaken, were erected subsequently to the building of\r\nEmania by Eochaidh Ollamb Fodlha in the third century B.C.\r\nThere may be cairns, and even dolmens, belonging to the earlier\r\nHiberni before the Scoti were driven from the Continent, by the Punic\r\nor Roman wars, to seek refuge and repose in the green island of the\r\nWest, but they must be insignificant, and probably must remain for ever\r\nunrecognizable.\r\n\r\nFrom the date, however, of the founding of Emania we seem to have a\r\nperfectly consecutive and intelligible series commencing with the\r\nsmaller and ruder cairns of Lough Crew, and rising at last to the\r\nlordly sepulchres of Brugh na Boinne. Between these two stand the\r\nmonuments on the battle-fields of Moytura, and contemporary with the\r\nlast are the Raths on the far-famed hill of Tara. Beyond these we seem\r\nto have the tomb of the four Moels, the so-called house of Calliagh\r\nBirra, and the dolmens of Glencolumbkille, all apparently belonging\r\nto the sixth century. The tumulus at Greenmount is later than any of\r\nthese, but hardly belongs to our Irish series.\r\n\r\nFrom these we pass by easy gradations to the beehive cells and\r\noratories of the early Christians. No such stone dwellings probably\r\nexisted before the time of St. Patrick, or we should have found traces\r\nof them at Tara, or Armagh, or Telltown; but as none such existed\r\nin these royal seats of the Scots, we may fairly assume that for\r\ndomestic purposes wood and turf alone were used. But as soon as the\r\nuse of stone became prevalent for such purposes, as was the case with\r\nthe introduction of Christianity, we soon find the round towers, with\r\ntheir accompanying churches, springing up in every corner of the land,\r\nand Irish architecture progressing steadily in a groove of its own,\r\ntill its forms were modified, but not obliterated, by the changes\r\nintroduced by the English conquerors. The history of their style from\r\nSt. Patrick to the English conquerers has been so well written by\r\nPetrie, that little now remains to be said about that division. But the\r\nhistory of the preceding seven centuries still remains for some one\r\nwith the leisure requisite to explore the country, and with patience\r\nand judgment sufficient to read aright the many enigmas which are\r\nstill involved in it, although the main outlines of the story seem\r\nsufficiently clear and intelligible. If it were written out in detail\r\nand fully illustrated, it would prove a most valuable commentary on\r\nthe dark period of the history of Ireland before the introduction of\r\nChristianity, and when the concomitant introduction of alphabetic\r\nwriting first rendered her annals intelligible and trustworthy.\r\n\r\nIn one other respect the study of these early monuments of Ireland\r\nseems to afford a subject of most engrossing interest. It is in Ireland\r\nthat we first begin to perceive the threefold division, which, if it\r\ncan be established, will lead to the most important ethnographical\r\ndeterminations. It appears that in this island the stone circles of\r\nthe Scandinavians were introduced simultaneously with the dolmens of\r\nthe Iberians or Aquitanians, and we can trace the rude barrows of\r\nthe Celts growing up between them till they expanded into the great\r\nmounds of the Boyne. That these three forms ever were at any one time\r\nabsolutely distinct is most unlikely, and equally so that they should\r\nhave long remained so in the same country, even if it could be shown\r\nthat at any one time they belonged to three separate races. Generally,\r\nhowever, it seems hardly doubtful that they do point to ethnographic\r\npeculiarities, which may become most important. Combined with their\r\nhistory and a knowledge of their uses, these monuments promise to\r\nrescue from oblivion one of the most curious chapters of Irish history,\r\nwhich without them might remain for ever unwritten.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 201: Stokes, 'Life of Petrie;' London, 1868, p. 99 _et\r\n    seq._]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 202: In the following pages it is proposed to follow the\r\n    popular and pronounceable spelling of Irish proper names.

It is, however, hardly worth\r\n    while arguing the question here, as we have nothing but a nominal\r\n    similarity to go upon, which is never much to be relied upon.\r\n\r\n    * Reeves, 'Vita Adamnani,' p. 210.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 262: Eugene Conwell's pamphlet descriptive of the Lough\r\n    Crew Tumuli, p. 2.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 263: The following particulars are taken from a paper by\r\n    General Lefroy, in the 'Archæological Journal,' No. 180, 1870, pp.\r\n    281 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 264: My attention was first directed to this monument by\r\n    Mr. Samuel Ferguson, Keeper of the Records, Dublin.

Such descriptions, however, as exist are\r\nscattered through the pages of ponderous statistical compilations,\r\nor in the transactions of learned societies in England and Scotland,\r\nor in local journals, so that it is extremely difficult to acquire a\r\nconnected grasp of the whole subject, or to feel sure you do know all\r\nthat is required, and still more difficult to convey to others a clear\r\nview of its outlines. Had any one done for the unsculptured stones\r\nof Scotland what John Stuart has done for those that have devices\r\nin them, the case would be widely different. Except Daniel Wilson's\r\n'Prehistoric Annals of Scotland'--whatever that may mean--no general\r\naccount is available, and that work is too brief and too sparsely\r\nillustrated to be of much use. The introductory matter, however, in\r\nMr. Stuart's two volumes,[271] with Mr. Wilson's book, may suffice for\r\nmost purposes; but a complete knowledge can only be obtained by wading\r\nthrough the volumes of the Scotch and English Archæologias, and the\r\ntransactions and proceedings of the various antiquarian societies of\r\nboth countries.[272]\r\n\r\nPutting aside for the present the sculptured stones as hardly belonging\r\nto our subject, and the \"cat\" or battle stones, their predecessors,\r\nthough they are numerous, as might be expected among the pugnacious\r\nCeltic races who inhabited the country, the remaining rude stone\r\nmonuments are not numerous. The free-standing dolmens are few and far\r\nbetween, some half-dozen for the whole country, and none of them with\r\nhistories or traditions attached to them. The circles, however, are\r\nnumerous and important, and to some extent are calculated to throw\r\nlight on our investigations. If we exclude the two battle-fields of\r\nMoytura, they are infinitely more numerous than those found in all\r\nIreland and Wales put together, although there is only one group, that\r\nat Stennis in the Orkneys, that can compare with the great English\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nTheir distribution too is interesting. No stone circles exist in\r\nthe lowlands or south of the Frith of Forth and Clyde; and dolmens\r\nare rare in these regions, though this may arise from the extent to\r\nwhich cultivation is carried on there. Until, however, a statistical\r\naccount is compiled, accompanied with a map, it is difficult to speak\r\nconfidently on such a subject, but the general impression is that the\r\nlowlands are not, and never were, a region of megalithic remains;\r\nand if this is so, it is one of the many proofs that the dolmens are\r\nneither pre-Roman nor Celtic. At least we have no reason to believe\r\nthat the Teutonic races who now occupy that country were settled there\r\nin the time of Agricola. But if the Celts or Picts who then inhabited\r\nthat land had been in the habit of raising megalithic structures, we\r\nwould have been more likely to find traces of them in that densely\r\ninhabited country than in the bleak uplands of Aberdeenshire, or the\r\nbare pastures of the Orkney Islands.\r\n\r\nThe district of Scotland where these circles and rude stone monuments\r\nmost abound is on either side of a straight line drawn direct from\r\nInverness to Aberdeen, which is a locality where sculptured stones are\r\nalso found in considerable numbers, but the rude stone monuments are\r\nnot found in Angus or Fife, where their sculptured successors are most\r\nnumerous. The district of the circles _par excellence_ in Scotland,\r\nhowever, is not on the mainland at all, but in the northern and western\r\nisles. The principal group is in the Orkneys; next in importance are\r\nthose in Lewes. They are found in Skye and Kantyre. There are several\r\nin Arran, and thence the transition is easy to the Isle of Man, where\r\nthey meet the English group in Cumberland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe larger circles in the Orkneys are four in number; three of these\r\nstand on a long slip of land that divides the loch of Harra from that\r\nof Stennis. The fourth is at some little distance from the others,\r\nand separated from them by a narrow strait connecting the two lochs.\r\nBesides these there are several smaller earthen circles and numerous\r\ntumuli. The largest circle, known as the Ring of Brogar,[273] is 340\r\nfeet (100 metres) in diameter between the stones. These originally were\r\nsixty in number, ranging from 6 and 7 to 15 feet in height; outside the\r\nstones runs a ditch about 30 feet in width, and 6 in depth, but with\r\nno perceptible rampart on either side. Two causeways cross the ditch\r\nas at Penrith or Arbor Low (woodcuts No. 29 and 30) opposite to one\r\nanother, but neither square with the axis of the spit of land on which\r\nthe circle is situated, nor facing any of the four cardinal points of\r\nthe heavens.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to this is the circle at Stennis, about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile distant. It consisted originally of twelve\r\nstones 15 to 18 feet in height. Only two are now erect, but a third was\r\nso not many years ago; and the fourth, of which now only a fragment\r\nremains, is represented as standing when the drawing, which forms the\r\nfrontispiece to this work, was made.[274] The remains of a dolmen still\r\nexist within the circle, not however in the centre, but close to its\r\nside, one of the stones of the circle apparently acting as head-stone\r\nto it. Beyond the stone circle which measures 104 feet in diameter is\r\na ditch 50 feet wide, making the whole diameter of the monument to the\r\noutward edge of the surrounding mound about 240 feet. Not far from this\r\ncircle, and close to the bridge of Brogar, stands a single monolith 18\r\nfeet in height, which is the finest and highest stone of the group; and\r\nin another direction a lesser one, with a hole through it. Though only\r\n8 feet high, 3 feet broad, and 9 inches thick, this stone has become\r\nmore famous than the others, from the use Sir Walter Scott makes of\r\nit in the 'Pirate,' and because, till a very recent period, an oath\r\ntaken with hands joined through the hole in the Stone of Woden, was\r\nconsidered even by the courts in Orkney as more than usually solemn and\r\nbinding.[275]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 84. Circle at Stennis. From Lieutenant Thomas's plan.]\r\n\r\nNo excavations, so far as I know, have been attempted in the circle\r\nof Stennis, but its ruined dolmen is probably sufficient to attest\r\nits sepulchral character. Some attempts at exploration were made in\r\nthe larger Ring at Brogar, but without success. This is hardly to be\r\nwondered at, for a man must feel very sure where to look, who expects\r\nto find a small deposit in an area of two acres. The diggings are\r\nunderstood to have been made in the centre. There, however, the ground\r\nlooks very like the undisturbed surface of the original moor, and as\r\nif it had never been levelled or used either for interment or any\r\nother human purpose, and slopes away irregularly some 6 feet towards\r\nthe loch. My impression is that the deposits, if any exist, will be\r\nfound near the outer circumference of the circle, either at the\r\nfoot of the stones as at Crichie, or outside the ditch as at Hakpen\r\nor Stonehenge. In the smaller circles the diameter of which does not\r\nexceed 100 feet, the deposit seems either to have been in the centre;\r\nor, if at the sides, the stones were so arranged as to mark its place.\r\nIn the larger, or 100-metre circles, we have not yet ascertained where\r\nto look. Accident may some day reveal the proper spot, but till it is\r\nascertained either scientifically or fortuitously, no argument can be\r\nbased on the negative evidence which our ignorance affords.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of these stone circles are several bowl-shaped\r\nbarrows similar to those in the neighbourhood of Stonehenge, not only\r\nexternally but internally. When opened they were almost all found to\r\ncontain interments by cremation and rude half-burnt pottery. It is not\r\nhere, however, that these barrows are found in the greatest numbers.\r\nIn the neighbouring parish of Sandwick they exist in hundreds, and\r\nscattered exactly as on the Wiltshire downs, here and there, singly or\r\nin pairs, without any apparent arrangement or grouping. It is said that\r\nthere are at least 2000 of these mole-hill barrows in the islands.[276]\r\nHere, as there, it would seem, that where a man lived and died there\r\nhe was buried, without any reference to anything existing, or that had\r\nexisted. None of these barrows have stone circles of any sort attached\r\nto them. Indeed, the only rude stone monuments in Orkney of the class\r\nwe are discussing are those just described, and they are all confined\r\nto one remote inhospitable-looking spot. Close to these, however,\r\nLieutenant Thomas enumerates six or seven conoid barrows, whose form\r\nand contents are of a very different nature. The bodies in them had\r\nbeen buried entire without cremation, and with their remains were found\r\nsilver torques and other ornaments, similar as far as can be made\r\nout--none are engraved--to those found in Skail Bay, along with coins\r\nof Athelstane, 925, and of the Caliphs of Bagdad, of dates from 887 to\r\n945.[277] That these conoid graves here, as well as others found in the\r\nislands, are of Scandinavian origin, can hardly be doubted, and their\r\njuxtaposition to the circles is at least suggestive. If the circles\r\nwere monuments of the Celts, whom they despised, and in fact had even\r\nthen exterminated, they would hardly choose a burying-place so close to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most important, however, of all the tumuli, not only in this\r\nneighbourhood, but in the islands, is known as the Maes-Howe. It was\r\nopened in 1861, in the presence of a select party of antiquaries from\r\nEdinburgh, who had hoped from its external appearance to find it\r\nintact: in this, however, they were disappointed. It would seem that\r\nmen of the same race as those who erected it, but who in the meanwhile\r\nhad been converted to Christianity, had apparently in the middle of the\r\ntwelfth century broken into this sepulchre of their Pagan forefathers,\r\nand despoiled it of its contents. As some compensation for this, they\r\nhave written their names in very legible Runes on the walls of the\r\ntomb, and recorded, in short sentences, what they knew and believed of\r\nits origin.[278]\r\n\r\nFrom these Runes we learn, in the first place, that the robbers were\r\nChristian pilgrims on their way to the Holy Land--Iorsala Farer--from\r\nwhich Professor Munch infers that they must have formed part of the\r\nexpedition organized for that purpose by Jarl Ragnvald, 1152. Beyond\r\nthis it is not possible to lay much stress on what these Runes tell\r\nus. In the first place, because the learned men to whom they have been\r\nsubmitted differ considerably in their interpretation,[279] and the\r\nrecord, even in the best of them, is indistinct. In one or two respects\r\nthe evidence of the inscriptions may be considered satisfactory. Their\r\nwriters all seem to have known so perfectly what the tomb was, and\r\nto whom it belonged, that no one cared to record, except in the most\r\npoetic fashion, what every one on the spot probably knew perfectly\r\nwell. At all events, there is no allusion in these inscriptions to any\r\nother or earlier race. Every expression, whether intelligible or not,\r\nbears a northern stamp. Lothbrok, Ingeborg, and all the other names\r\nintroduced are Scandinavian, and all the allusions have a Northern\r\ntwang. Though this is merely negative evidence, it certainly goes some\r\nway to show that the robbers were aware that the Howe was originally\r\nerected by people of their own race. If, however, the direct evidence\r\nof these inscriptions is inconclusive, there is one engraving on a\r\npillar facing the entrance which looks as if it were original, both\r\nfrom its position and character. It represents a dragon (woodcut No.\r\n85) of a peculiar Scandinavian type. A similar one is found on a stone\r\nattached to the tumulus under which King Gorm was buried, at Jellinge,\r\nin Denmark, in the middle of the tenth century. Making allowance for\r\nthe difference in drawing, they are so like that they cannot be very\r\ndistinct in date. A third animal of this species is found at Hunestadt,\r\nin Scania,[280] and dating about the year 1150, but very different,\r\nand very much more modern-looking than this one. Had the Jerusalem\r\npilgrims drawn this dragon, it would probably have been much more like\r\nthe Hunestadt example. On the other hand, if the one at Maes-Howe is\r\noriginal, the age of the tomb can hardly be half a century distant\r\nfrom that of King Gorm's Howe, which in other respects it very much\r\nresembles. It is, however, very unlikely that Christian pilgrims would\r\ndraw a dragon like this, and still less that they would accompany it\r\nwith a Wurm, or Serpent-Knot, like that found on the same pillar; both\r\nlook like Pagan emblems, and seem to belong to the original decorations\r\nof the tomb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 85. Dragon in Maes-Howe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 86. Wurm-Knot, Maes-Howe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 87. Plan and Section of Maes-Howe. From Mr. Farrer's\r\nwork.]\r\n\r\nAmong the inscriptions in Maes-Howe is one which, from its apparent\r\ninsignificance, none of the interpreters have condescended to notice.\r\nIt will be observed on one of the loose stones lying in the foreground\r\non woodcut No. 88, it consists of only four letters, and reads either\r\nHIAI or IKIH, according as it is turned one way or another. As it is\r\nimpossible to make a recognisable word, much less sense out of such\r\na combination, it is no wonder it was thrown aside; but it is just\r\nbecause it is unintelligible that it may turn out to be valuable as an\r\nindex to the age of the monument. Nothing is more unlikely than that a\r\nIorsala Farer would have idly engraved these Runes on a loose stone,\r\nbut nothing more likely than that a mason who hewed the stone and\r\nfitted it to close the \"loculus\" exactly, would have put a mark upon\r\nit to show that it belonged to the right-hand chamber in which A or B\r\nwas to be buried. The inscription is on the inner edge of the stone,\r\nwhere it would be hid when the stone was _in situ_, and most probably\r\nwas engraved on the stone before it was originally used to close the\r\nopening.\r\n\r\nThis, at least, is an explanation of its meaning better than any other\r\nwhich has yet been suggested, and if it is the correct one, this\r\ninscription with the Dragon and the Wurm-Knot are among the original\r\nsculptures of the tomb; and, if so, it will be difficult to assign it\r\nto an earlier age than the tenth century, which, from the circumstances\r\nto be mentioned hereafter, seems on the whole the most probable date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 88. View of Chamber in Maes-Howe. From a drawing by Mr.\r\nFarrer.]\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the tumulus, though offering some indications of\r\ngreat value, hardly possesses any features sufficiently marked to fix\r\nits date with certainty. Externally it is a truncated cone (woodcut\r\nNo. 87), about 92 feet in diameter, by 36 feet in height, and is\r\nsurrounded at a distance of about 90 feet by a ditch 40 feet wide, and\r\n6 feet deep, out of which the earth seems to have been taken which was\r\nrequired to form the mound. Internally it contains a chamber slightly\r\ncruciform in plan, measuring 15 feet 4 inches, by 14 feet 10 inches,\r\nand, when complete, probably 17 feet in height. On each of three sides\r\nof the chamber is a sepulchral loculus, entered by a small opening 3\r\nfeet from the ground. The largest of these, that on the right as you\r\nenter, is 7 feet by 4 feet 6 inches, and the central one 5 feet 6\r\ninches by 4 feet 6 inches. Each of these was closed by a single stone\r\ncarefully squared, so as to fit the opening. The passage leading into\r\nthe central chamber was 3 feet wide by 4 feet 6 inches in height, and\r\noriginally closed, apparently by a doorway at 2 feet 6 inches from the\r\nchamber. Beyond this it is lined by two slabs 18 feet long, reaching\r\nnearly to a recess, which seems arranged as if to receive the real door\r\nwhich closed the sepulchre, probably a large stone. Beyond this the\r\npassage still extends some 20 feet to the present entrance, but is of\r\nvery inferior class of masonry, and how much of it is modern is not\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that strikes any one on examining this mound is that\r\nit certainly is the lineal descendant of the great cairns on the\r\nbanks of the Boyne, but separated from them by a very long interval\r\nof time. It is not easy to determine what interval must have elapsed\r\nbefore the side chambers of those tombs merged into the \"loculi\" of\r\nthis, or how long it must have been before their rude unhewn masses\r\nwere refined into the perfectly well-fitted masonry of this one. Some\r\nallowance must, however, be made for the difference of material. The\r\nold red sandstone of the Orkneys splitting easily into self-faced\r\nslabs, offers wonderful facilities for its use, but still the way in\r\nwhich the angle-buttresses of the chamber were fitted, and the cells\r\nfinished, and the great slabs line the entrance, all show a progress in\r\nmasonic science that must have required centuries, assuming, of course,\r\nthat they were built by the same people. But was this so? So far as\r\nwe at present know, these islands, when conquered by Harold Harfagar\r\nin 875, were inhabited by two races called Pape and Peti. The former\r\nwere generally assumed to have been colonies of Irish missionaries and\r\ntheir followers, who settled here after the conversion of the Picts\r\nby St. Columba in the middle of the sixth century. The Peti, it is\r\nalso generally assumed, were the Pechts, or Picts.[281] It will not be\r\neasy to ascertain now whether they were so or not, as, according to\r\nBishop Tulloch, they were so entirely exterminated by the Northmen,\r\nthat of their \"posteritie there remained nocht.\" But if the Pape, or\r\nPapas were Irish missionaries, they were Christians, and whatever else\r\nMaes-Howe may be, it certainly is not a place of Christian burial. Nor\r\nis it Pictish. If it were, we certainly should find something like it\r\nin Pictland proper; but nothing that can be at all compared with it\r\nis found in Fife or Forfar, or in any of those countries which were\r\noccupied by the Picts in the days of their greatness; and it is most\r\nimprobable that a people who could not, or at least did not, erect any\r\nsuch sepulchre in the fertile and populous lands which they occupied\r\non the mainland, would erect such a one as this on a comparatively\r\nbarren and sparsely inhabited island. On the other hand, there seems\r\nevery reason for believing that the 2000 little barrows above alluded\r\nto are the graves of the Picts, or original inhabitants of the island\r\nbefore they were exterminated by the Northmen. These barrows, however,\r\nhave absolutely no affinity with Maes-Howe. None of them have chambers,\r\nnone have circles of stone round them; all are curvilinear, and none,\r\nindeed, show anything to induce the belief that in any length of time\r\nthey would be developed into such a sepulchre as that which we have\r\nbeen describing. It is in fact the story of Stonehenge and its barrows\r\nover again. A race of Giants superseding a nation of Pigmies with which\r\nthey certainly had no blood affinities, and erecting among their puny\r\nsepulchres monuments dedicated, it may be, to similar purposes, but as\r\nlittle like them in reality as the great cathedrals of the middle ages\r\nare to the timber churches of the early Saxons.\r\n\r\nOnly one hypothesis seems to remain, which is that it is a tomb of\r\nthe northern men who conquered these islands in the ninth century.\r\nThis may seem a very prosaic descent from the primæval antiquity some\r\nare inclined to ascribe to these monuments, but it certainly is not\r\nimprobable; in the first place, because we have what seems undoubted\r\ntestimony that Thorfin, one of the Jarls (940 to 970 A.D.)\r\n\"was buried on Ronaldshay under a tumulus, which was then known by\r\nthe name of Haugagerdium, and is perhaps the same as that we now call\r\nthe How of Hoogsay,\" or Hoxay.[282] I have not been able to ascertain\r\nwhether this is literally true or not, but have reason to believe that\r\nit was not in the How of Hoxay that Thorfin was buried, but in a mound\r\nclose by.[283] The fact of his being buried in a Howe is, however, all\r\nthat is at present demanded. Another important barrow is mentioned by\r\nProfessor Munch,[284] known as Halfdan's Barrow, in Sandy, and raised\r\nby Torf Einar (925 to 936). So that we know of at least two important\r\nbarrows belonging to the Norwegian Jarls in the tenth century, though\r\nonly one has been identified with absolute certainty. As before\r\nmentioned, it is quite certain that King Gorm (died 950) and Thyra of\r\nDenmark were buried in tumuli in outward appearance very similar to\r\nMaes-Howe. That of Queen Thyra has alone been opened. It is a chamber\r\ntomb, similar to Maes-Howe, except in this, that the chamber in Denmark\r\nis formed with logs of wood, in the Orkneys with slabs of stone, but\r\nthe difference is easily accounted for. At Jellinge stone is rare,\r\nand the country was covered with forests. At Stennis self-faced slabs\r\nof stone were to be had for the lifting, and trees were unknown. The\r\nconsequence was, that workmen employed the best material available to\r\ncarry out their purpose. Be that as it may, the fact that kings of\r\nDenmark and Jarls of Orkney were buried in Howes in the tenth century,\r\ntakes away all _à priori_ improbability from the hypothesis that\r\nMaes-Howe may be a sepulchre of one of those Northmen.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, our choice of an occupant lies within very narrow\r\nlimits. We cannot well go back beyond the time of Harold Harfagar\r\n(876 to 920), who first really took possession of these islands, as\r\na dependency of Norway, and created Sigurd the elder first Jarl of\r\nOrkney in 920. Nor can we descend below the age of the second Sigurd,\r\nwho became Earl in 996, as we know he was converted by Olaus to\r\nChristianity, and was killed at Clontarf in 1014.[285] Within these\r\nseventy-six years that elapsed between 920 and 996 there is only one\r\nname that seems to meet all the exigencies of the case, and in a manner\r\nthat can hardly be accidental. Havard \"the happy,\" one of the sons of\r\nThorfin, who was buried at Hoxay, was slain at Stennis in 970. Havard\r\nhad married Raguhilda, the daughter of Eric Blodoxe, prince of Norway,\r\nand widow of his brother Arfin, but she, tired of her second husband,\r\nstirred up one of his nephews against him, and a battle was fought at\r\nStennis, on a spot, says Barry, \"which afterwards bore the name of\r\nHavardztugar, from the event or the slaughter.\"[286] The same story is\r\nrepeated by Professor Wilson as follows, \"Olaf Tryguesson, says Havard,\r\nwas then at Steinsnes in Rossey. There was meeting and battle about\r\nHavard, and it was not long before the Jarl fell. The place is now\r\ncalled Havardsteiger. So it was called, and so M. Petrie writes me, it\r\nis still called by the peasantry to the present day.\"[287] Professor\r\nMunch, of Christiania, who visited the place in 1849, arrived at the\r\nconclusion \"that most of the grave mounds grouped around the Brogar\r\ncircle are, probably, memorials of this battle, and perhaps one of the\r\nlarger that of Havard Earl.\"[288] In this I have no doubt he is right,\r\nbut that larger one I take to be Maes-Howe, which is in sight of the\r\ncircle, though not so close to it as those he was speaking of.\r\n\r\nOne circumstance which at first sight renders this view of the case\r\nmore than probable is, that Maes-Howe is, so far as we at present know,\r\nunique. Thorfin's grave, when found, may be a chambered tumulus, so may\r\nHalfdan's Barrow, when opened, but no others are known in Orkney. If\r\nit had been the tomb of a king or chief of any native dynasty, similar\r\nsepulchres must have been as numerous as they were on the banks of the\r\nBoyne or Blackwater. There must have been a succession of them, some\r\nof greater, some of less magnificence. Nothing of the sort, however,\r\noccurs, and till more are found, the Stennis group cannot be ascribed\r\nto a dynasty that lasted longer than the seventy-six years just quoted.\r\nThat brief dynasty must also have been the most splendid and the\r\nmost powerful of all that reigned in these islands, as no tomb there\r\napproaches Maes-Howe in magnificence. If such a description suits any\r\nother race than that of the Norwegian Jarls, I do not know where to\r\nlook for an account of it.\r\n\r\nAssuming for the present that this is so, we naturally turn to the\r\nRunic inscriptions on the walls of the tomb to see how far they\r\nconfirm or refute this view. Unfortunately there is nothing in them\r\nvery distinct either one way or the other. The only recognizable names\r\nare those of Lothbrok and Ingiborg. The former, if the Lothbrok of\r\nNorthumbrian notoriety, is too early; the Ingiborg, if the wife of\r\nSigurd the Second, is too late, though, as the first Christian countess\r\nof Orkney, her name may have got mixed up in some way with the tomb\r\nof the last Pagan Jarl. But should we expect to find any sober record\r\nof the date and purposes of the Howe in any of the scribblings on the\r\nwalls? The English barbarians who write their names and rhymes on the\r\nwalls of the tombs around Delhi and Agra do not say this is the tomb\r\nof Humayoon, or Akbar, or of Etimad Doulah, or Seyed Ahmed. They write\r\nsome doggerel about Timour the Tartar, or the Great Mogul, or some\r\nwretched jokes about their own people. The same feeling seems to have\r\nguided the Christian Northmen in their treatment of the tomb of their\r\nPagan predecessor, and though, consequently, we find nothing that can\r\nfairly be quoted as confirming the view that it is the tomb of Havard,\r\nthere is nothing that can be assumed as contradicting it.\r\n\r\nOne inscription may, however, be considered as throwing some light on\r\nthe subject. In XIX.XX. it is related, though in words so differently\r\ntranslated by the various experts to whom it was submitted, that it\r\nis difficult to quote them, that \"much fee was found in the Orkhow,\r\nand that this treasure was buried to the north west,\" adding, \"happy\r\nis he who may discover this great wealth.\"[289] A few years ago a\r\ngreat treasure was found to the north-west of Maes-Howe, in Skail Bay,\r\njust in such a position as a pirate on his way to the Holy Land would\r\nhide it, in the hope, on his return, to dig it up and take it home;\r\nbut shipwreck or fever may have prevented his doing this. With this\r\ntreasure were found, as mentioned above, coins of Athelstane of the\r\ndate of 925, and of the Caliphs of Bagdad, extending to 945, just such\r\ndates as we should expect in a tomb of 970, recent, but not the most\r\nrecent coins. Connecting these with the silver torques found in the\r\nconoid barrows around the Ring of Brogar, we seem to have exactly such\r\na group of monuments as the histories above quoted would lead us to\r\nexpect, and which with their contents belong almost certainly to the\r\nage above assigned to them.\r\n\r\nHad Maes-Howe been an old sepulchre of an earlier race, when the\r\nNorthmen ravaged the western islands in the early part of the ninth\r\ncentury, it is most improbable that they would have neglected to break\r\ninto the \"Orkhow.\" The treasures which Amlaff and his Danes found in\r\nthe mounds on the banks of the Boyne would certainly have stimulated\r\nthese explorers to see what was contained in the Orcadian tumulus.\r\nHad they done this, the Jerusalem pilgrims would not, three centuries\r\nlater, have been able to record that \"much fee\" was found in the tomb,\r\nand was buried to the north-west, apparently in Skail Bay. The whole\r\nevidence of the inscriptions, in so far as it goes, tends to prove that\r\nthe tomb was intact when broken into in the twelfth century. If this is\r\nso, nothing is so unlikely as that it could have remained unrifled if\r\nexisting before the year 861, as a Celtic sepulchre. On the other hand,\r\nnothing seems more probable than that Christian Northmen would have\r\nplundered the grave of one of their Pagan ancestors, whom they knew had\r\nbeen buried \"with much fee\" in this tumulus two centuries before their\r\ntime. Two hundred years, it must be recollected, is a very long time\r\namong an illiterate people. A long time, indeed, among ourselves, with\r\nall our literary aids; and when we add to this the change of religion\r\nthat had taken place among the Northmen in the interval, we need not\r\nbe surprised at any amount of ignorance of history or contempt for\r\nthe customs of their Pagan forefathers on the part of the Jerusalem\r\npilgrims. The time, at all events, was sufficiently long fully to\r\njustify Christian robbers in helping themselves to the treasures of\r\ntheir Pagan forefathers.\r\n\r\nEven assuming, however, that Maes-Howe is the tomb of Havard, or of\r\nsome other of the Pagan Norwegian Jarls of Orkney, the question still\r\nremains whether it has any, and, if any, what connexion with the two\r\ncircles in the immediate neighbourhood?[290]\r\n\r\nLocally, the Howe and the circles certainly form one group. No such\r\ntumuli, and no such circles exist in other parts of the islands,\r\nand the spot is so inhospitable, so far from any of the centres of\r\npopulation in the island, that it is difficult to conceive why it\r\nshould have been chosen, unless from the accident of being the scene\r\nof some important events. If Havard was slain here, which there seems\r\nno reason for doubting, nothing seems more probable than that one of\r\nhis surviving brothers, Liotr or Laudver, should have erected a tumulus\r\nover his grave, meaning it also to be a sepulchre for themselves. On\r\nthe other hand, it is extremely unlikely that the six or seven other\r\ntumuli which are admitted to be of Scandinavian origin should have\r\ngathered round the Ring of Brogar if it had been a Pagan fane of the\r\ndespised Celts, who preceded them in the possession of the island. It\r\ncannot be necessary here to go over the questions again, whether a\r\nfew widely spaced stones stuck up around a circle one hundred metres\r\nin diameter was or was not a temple. It is just such a monument as\r\n1000 victorious soldiers could set up in a week. It is such as the\r\ninhabitants of the district could not set up in years, and would not\r\nattempt, because, when done, it would have been absolutely useless to\r\nthem for any purpose either civil or religious; and if it is not, as\r\nbefore said, a ring in which those who fell in battle were buried, I\r\nknow not what it is. The chiefs, in this case, would be buried in the\r\nconoid barrows close around, the Jarl in the neighbouring howe.\r\n\r\nAs Stennis is mentioned in the Sagas that give an account of Havard's\r\ndeath, it probably existed there, and was called by the simple\r\nScandinavian name which the Northmen gave to all this class of stone\r\nmonuments. None, so far as I know, have retained a Celtic denomination.\r\nAssuming it to be earlier, it still can hardly be carried back beyond\r\nthe year 800. The earliest date of the appearance of the Northmen in\r\nmodern times is in the year 793 in the 'Irish Annals,' where mention\r\nis made of a \"vastatio omnium insularum a Gentibus.\"[291] In 802,\r\nand again in 818, they harried Iona,[292] and from that time forward\r\nseem constantly to have conducted piratical expeditions along these\r\ncoasts, until they ended by formally occupying the Orkneys under Harold\r\nHarfagar. Though smaller in diameter, Stennis has a grander and a more\r\nancient look than Brogar, and may even be a century or two older, and\r\nbe a monument of some chief who fell here in some earlier fight. That\r\nit is sepulchral can hardly be a matter of doubt from the dolmen inside\r\nits ring.\r\n\r\nConnected with the circle at Stennis is the holed stone[293] alluded to\r\nabove, which seems to be a most distinct and positive testimony to the\r\nnationality of this group of monuments.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain that the oath to Woden or Odin was sworn by persons\r\njoining their hands through the hole in this ring stone, and that an\r\noath so taken, although by Christians, was deemed solemn and binding.\r\nThis ceremony was held so very sacred in those times, that the person\r\nwho dared to break the engagement made there was accounted infamous and\r\nexcluded from society.[294] Principal Gordon, in his 'Journey to the\r\nOrkney Islands' in 1781, relates the following anecdote:--\"The young\r\nman was called before the session, and the elders were particularly\r\nsevere. Being asked by the minister the cause of so much severity, they\r\nanswered, 'You do not know what a bad man this is; he has broken the\r\npromise of Odin,' and further explained that the contracting parties\r\nhad joined hands through the hole in the stone.\"[295]\r\n\r\nSuch a dedication of a stone to Woden seems impossible after their\r\nconversion of the Northmen to Christianity about the year 1000, and\r\nmost improbable if the monument was of Celtic origin, and existed\r\nbefore the conquest of the country 123 years earlier. If the Northmen\r\nhad not hated and despised their predecessors they would never have\r\nexterminated them; but while engaged in this work is it likely they\r\nwould have adopted one of their monuments as especially sacred, and\r\nfollowed up one of their customs, supposing this to have been one,\r\nthough there is absolutely no proof in a holed stone being used in any\r\nCeltic cemetery for any such purpose? The only solution seems to be\r\nthat the monument, with this accompaniment, was erected between the\r\nconquest of the country and the conversion of the conquerors, and, like\r\nmany ancient rites, remained unchanged through ages, not as adopted\r\nfrom the conquered races, but because their forefathers had practised\r\nit from time immemorial in their native land. On any other hypothesis\r\nit seems impossible that so purely Pagan a rite could have survived\r\nthrough eight centuries of Christianity, and still be considered sacred\r\nby those whose ancestors had worshipped Wodin in the old times many\r\ncenturies before these stones were erected in the islands.\r\n\r\nAll this seems so clear and consistent, that it may be assumed that\r\nthis group of monuments were erected between the year 800 and 1000\r\nA.D., till, at least, some argument is brought forward leading\r\nto a certain conclusion. At present I know of only one which tends\r\nto make me pause: it is a curious one, and arises from the wonderful\r\nsimilarity that exists between this and some of the greater English\r\ngroups. Take, for instance, Stanton Drew (ante, p. 149). It consists of\r\na great circle 340 feet in diameter, the same as the Ring of Brogar,\r\nand of a smaller circle within three feet of the dimensions of that\r\nof Stennis (101 against 104), both the latter possess a dolmen, not\r\nin the centre, but on its edge, the only essential difference being\r\nthat the great ring at Stanton had twenty-four stones, and the smaller\r\none eight, as against sixty and twelve in the northern example; this,\r\nhowever, may arise from the one being in a locality so much more stony\r\nthan the other, and it must be confessed the Stanton stones look older,\r\nbut this also may arise from the different nature of the rocks from\r\nwhich they were taken.\r\n\r\nThe Ring of Bookan answers to the circle in the orchard; the Watch\r\nor King Stone at Stennis to Hautville's Quoit. Even the names are\r\nthe same, \"ton\" and \"ness\" being merely descriptive of the townland,\r\nand the long slip of land on which they are respectively situated,\r\nand Maes-Knoll looks down on the one, and Maes-Howe into the other.\r\nThe only thing wanted is a ring stone in the Somersetshire example,\r\nbut that might easily have disappeared, and there is one at Avebury.\r\nSome of these coincidences may, of course, be accidental, but they\r\nare too numerous and too exact to be wholly so. If at all admitted,\r\nthey seem to force us to one of two conclusions: either the time which\r\nelapsed between the ages of the two monuments is less than the previous\r\nreasoning would lead us to suppose, or the persistence in these forms,\r\nwhen once adopted, was greater than, on other grounds, it seems\r\nreasonable to expect. Three or four centuries seem a long time to have\r\nelapsed between buildings, the style of which is so nearly identical.\r\nIf, however, their dates are to be brought nearer to one another, it\r\nseems much more reasonable to bring Stanton Drew down, than to carry\r\nStennis back. It is much more consistent with what we know, to believe\r\nthat Stanton Drew was erected by Hubba and his Danes, than that the\r\nOrkney circles and Maes-Howe could have been the work of the wretched\r\nPape and Peti, who inhabited the island before the invasion of the\r\nNorthmen.\r\n\r\nAs this is the last of the great groups containing first-class circles,\r\nwhich we shall have to deal with in the following pages, it may be\r\nwell to try and sum up, in as few words as possible, the points of the\r\nevidence from which we arrive at the conclusion that it may be of the\r\ndate above assigned to it:--\r\n\r\n1. History is absolutely silent either for or against this theory. In\r\nso far as the _litera scripta_ is concerned, it may either have been\r\nerected by the Phœnicians or in the time of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\n2. The Danish theory is of no avail. No flint, bone, or bronze or iron\r\nimplements have been found in a position to throw any light on its age.\r\n\r\n3. There are in the islands some thousands of small mole-hill\r\nbarrows--insignificant, stoneless, unadorned.\r\n\r\n4. All parts of the Stennis group show design and power, and produce an\r\neffect of magnificence.\r\n\r\n5. It seems evident that the circles and the barrows belong to two\r\ndifferent peoples.\r\n\r\n6. If so, the barrows belong to the Peti and Pape; the large howes and\r\nthe stone monuments to the Northmen.\r\n\r\n7. If this is so, the latter belong to the two centuries comprised\r\nbetween 800 and 1000 A.D.\r\n\r\n8. Maes-Howe, being unique, must have belonged to the shortest, but\r\nmost magnificent dynasty in the Island.\r\n\r\n9. With regard to Havard. He was killed on, or close to the spot where\r\nMaes-Howe now stands.\r\n\r\n10. His father, Thorfin, was buried in a howe in Ronaldshay. His\r\ncontemporary, Gorm, was buried in a howe at Jellinge.\r\n\r\n11. A dragon and serpent were carved in Gorm's tomb. Similar\r\nrepresentations were found in Maes-Howe.\r\n\r\n12. The four Runic letters on the closing stone of the right-hand\r\nloculus, date probably from its first erection.\r\n\r\n13. All the subsequent inscriptions on the tomb acknowledge it as a\r\nScandinavian monument.\r\n\r\n14. The mention of treasure being found in it in 1152 goes far to show\r\nthat it did not exist in 861, or it would then have been robbed by the\r\nNorthmen, as the Irish tombs were.\r\n\r\n15. It is extremely probable that the Skail Bay \"find\" is part of this\r\ntreasure, which is not earlier than 945, and may be twenty or forty\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\n16. The torques found in the six large tumuli at Brogar belong to the\r\nsame age.\r\n\r\n17. The Holed Stone at Stennis was certainly set up by Northmen and by\r\nthem dedicated to Woden, and it certainly forms part of the group.\r\n\r\n18. The name Havard's Steigr, attaching to the place at the present\r\nday, is important.\r\n\r\nAgainst this, I know of only one argument: _Omne ignotum pro antiquo_;\r\nwhich, for reasons, given above, I reject.\r\n\r\nIf such a case were submitted to anyone, regarding a monument of\r\nwhich we had never heard before, no one would probably hesitate in\r\nconsidering the case as proved, till, at least, something more to the\r\npoint could be brought forward on the other side. Such, however, is\r\nthe effect of education, and so strong the impression on the minds of\r\nmost Englishmen with regard to Phœnicians and Druids, that nine\r\npeople out of ten will probably reject it; some alleging that it must\r\nbe an unfair, others that it is an inconclusive statement. Let them try\r\nand state their view in as few words, and I do not believe it will be\r\ndifficult to judge between the two cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLERNISH.\r\n\r\nThe next in importance after those of Stennis among the Scottish group\r\nof circles is that at Callernish, in the Isle of Lewis. They are\r\nsituated at the inner end of Loch Roag, on the western coast of the\r\nisland, and consequently more remote from the routes of traffic or\r\nthe centres of Pictish or Celtic civilization than even the Orcadian\r\ngroups. The country, too, in their neighbourhood is of the wildest\r\nand most barren description, and never could have been more densely\r\ninhabited than now, which is by a sparse population totally unequal to\r\nsuch monuments as these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 89. Monument at Callernish. From a plan by Sir Henry\r\nJames.]\r\n\r\nThe group consists of three or four circles, situated near to one\r\nanother, at the head of the bay. They are of the ordinary form, 60\r\nto 100 feet in diameter, and consequently not remarkable for their\r\ndimensions, nor are they for the size of the stones of which they are\r\ncomposed. One of them, which had been covered up with peat-moss, was\r\nexcavated some years ago, and a number of holes were found, filled,\r\nit is said, with charcoal of wood;[296] but the account is by no\r\nmeans satisfactory. About a mile to the westward of the three, on\r\nthe northern shore of Loch Roag, stands the principal monument. This\r\nconsists of a circle[297] 42 feet in diameter. In the centre of this is\r\na tall stone, about 17 feet high, which forms the head-stone of a grave\r\nof a somewhat cruciform plan; but it is in fact only the tricameral\r\narrangement common in tumuli in Caithness and other parts of the north\r\nof Scotland.[298] It apparently was covered originally by a little\r\ncairn of its own; but this had disappeared, and the tomb emptied of its\r\ncontents at some period anterior to the formation of the peat which had\r\naccumulated round the stones, and which was removed a few years ago\r\nby Sir James Matheson when this grave was first discovered. From the\r\ncentral stone a double avenue extends 294 feet, and from the same point\r\nsouthward, a single row for 114 feet; making the whole length of the\r\navenues 408 feet; while two arms extend east and west, measuring 130\r\nfeet across the whole.\r\n\r\nI believe it was John Stuart that first made the remark:--\"Remove\r\nthe cairn from New Grange, and the pillars would form another\r\nCallernish;\"[299] and there seems little doubt but that this is the\r\ntrue explanation of the peculiar form of the monument. Nor is it\r\ndifficult to see why this should be the case; for it must be borne in\r\nmind that the whole of the chambers and the access to them must have\r\nbeen constructed, and probably stood, naked for some time before they\r\nbegan to heap the cairn over them. Calliagh Birra's tomb (woodcut No.\r\n80), and the numerous \"Grottes des fées\" we meet with in France and\r\nelsewhere I look on as chambers, some of which it was intended should\r\nbe buried in tumuli, which, however, never were erected: others,\r\nwhen men had become familiar with the naked forms, were like many\r\ndolmens, never intended to be hidden. It may be a mere fancy; but I\r\ncannot escape from an impression that, in many instances at least, the\r\nchambers were constructed during their lifetime by kings or chiefs\r\nas their own tombs, and that the cairn was not raised over them till\r\nthe bodies were deposited in their recesses. This, at least, is the\r\ncase in the East, where most of the great tombs were erected by those\r\nwho were to lie in them. During their lifetime they used them as\r\npleasure-houses, and only after their death were the entrances walled\r\nup and the windows obscured, so as to produce the gloom supposed to\r\nbe appropriate to the residences of the dead. Another point is worth\r\nobserving. It seems most improbable that sculptures, such as are found\r\nin the Irish and French chambered tumuli, could have been executed by\r\nartificial light. Either the stones were sculptured before being put\r\ninto their places--which, to say the least of it, is very unlikely; or\r\nthey were sculptured while the light could still penetrate through the\r\ninterstices of the stones forming the walls. In any case, however, the\r\nnaked forms of these chambers must have been perfectly familiar with\r\nthose who used them; and there is no difficulty in understanding why,\r\nas at Carrowmore or Callernish, they should have repeated the same\r\nforms which were certainly never intended to be covered up.\r\n\r\nFrom the occurrence of a similar form at Northern Moytura (woodcut No.\r\n59), used externally also, it may be argued that this may be of the\r\nsame age. The Irish example, as explained above, is probably of the\r\nsame age as the great chambered tumuli of Meath; but there seems to be\r\na difference between the two, which would indicate a very different\r\nstate of affairs.\r\n\r\nAt Moytura, the covering stones, though thrown down, still exist, and\r\nthere is every appearance of direct imitation. At Callernish, the\r\nsize, the wide spacing, the pointed form of the stones, and the whole\r\nstructure exhibit so marked a difference from anything that could be\r\nintended to be covered up, that it certainly appears as if a long time\r\nhad passed before the original use of the form could have been so\r\ncompletely overlooked as it has been in this instance. Everyone must\r\ndetermine for himself how many centuries he would interpose between\r\nNew Grange and Callernish. To me it appears that an interval of very\r\nconsiderable duration must have elapsed between them.\r\n\r\nAt Tormore, on the west coast of the Isle of Arran, there is a third\r\ngroup of these monuments, more numerous, but not on so large a scale\r\nas those of Stennis or Callernish. These were all carefully examined\r\nby Dr. Bryce, of Glasgow, assisted by a party of archæologists, in\r\n1864, and the results recorded in the 'Proceedings of the Scottish\r\nAntiquaries,'[300] and also in a small work on the Geology of\r\nArran.[301] All were found to contain sepulchral remains, except one\r\nwhich had been rifled, but there the cist still remained. The principal\r\ncircle is now represented by only three upright stones, from 18 to 20\r\nfeet in height; but they originally formed parts of a circle 60 feet\r\nin diameter. Two other circles can be traced, and two kistvaens of\r\nconsiderable dimensions, and two obelisks on the high ground, which\r\napparently formed parts either of circles or of some other groups of\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nThough not so large as the other two groups named above, this one at\r\nTormore is interesting because it affords fair means of testing whether\r\nthese groups were cemeteries, or marked battle-fields. Here the two\r\nprincipal circles are situated on a peat moss which extends to some\r\nfeet, at least, below the bottom of the pillars, and the sepulchral\r\ndeposits were found in the peat. Others of these Tormore monuments are\r\nsituated where the peat joins the sandy soil, and others are situated\r\non the summit of the sandy hills, which here extend some way in from\r\nthe shore. Now it seems hardly probable that such a diversity of taste\r\nshould have existed in any line of princes. If the peat was chosen\r\nas a resting-place for some, it probably would have been for all.\r\nIf elevated sandy hillocks were more eligible for that purpose, why\r\nshould some have chosen the bog? and if a cemetery, why not all close\r\ntogether? They extend for about half a mile east and west at a distance\r\nof about a mile from the shore, and on about as desolate a plain as one\r\ncould find anywhere. If a battle was fought here against some enemy who\r\nhad landed in the bay, and those who were killed in it were interred\r\nwhere they fell, all the appearances would be easily explained; but\r\nit is difficult to guess who the chiefs or princes could be who were\r\nburied here, if they had leisure to select their last resting-place, or\r\nwhy they should have been buried in this scrambling fashion.\r\n\r\nThere are the remains of two other circles and one obelisk in Brodick\r\nBay, on the other side of the island, but widely scattered, and with\r\nnothing to indicate their purpose. There are also other circles and\r\ndetached standing stones in the Mull of Cantyre, up to the Crinan\r\nCanal; but the published maps of the Ordnance Survey do not extend so\r\nfar, and such accounts as have been published are too vague to admit of\r\nany conclusions being drawn from them either as to their age or uses.\r\n\r\nThe Aberdeenshire circles, above alluded to, differ in some respects\r\nfrom those found in other parts of the country, and are thus described\r\nby Colonel Forbes Leslie, in a Paper read to the British Association\r\nthis year:--\"The principal group of stones in these circles always\r\ncontains one stone, larger than the rest, which in different monuments\r\nvaries from 11 to 16 feet in length, and from 2 to 6 in breadth. It is\r\nnever placed upright; but close at each end of this recumbent monolith\r\nstand two columnar stones; these vary in height from 7 to 10 feet, and\r\nhave generally been selected of a pyramidal form. From the face, and\r\nnear the ends of the recumbent stone, two stones project about 4 feet\r\ninto the circle, and the recess thus formed is occupied by a stone laid\r\nflat on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"In several of these circles a raised platform, 5 or 6 feet broad, and\r\n18 or 24 inches high, can be traced. This has been supported on the\r\nouter side by a low wall connecting the columnar stones, which are\r\ndisposed at equal distances on the circumference. The inner side of\r\nthe platform has been supported by stones little more than its height,\r\nplaced near each other.\r\n\r\n\"Circles of this sort are found at Aquhorties, Tyrebagger, Balquhain,\r\nRothiemay, Parkhouse, near Deer, Daviot, New Craig, Dunadeer, &c.,\r\nin Aberdeenshire. There is also a circle on the \"Candle Hill of Old\r\nRayne,\"[302] within sight of which, on the slope of a ridge about a\r\nmile distant, stood the two sculptured stones now at Newton,--on one\r\nof which is the unique alphabetical inscription; and on the other\r\na serpent, with the broken sceptre, surmounted by the double disk,\r\nusually called the Spectacle Ornament.\"\r\n\r\nTheir general arrangement will be understood from the woodcut overleaf,\r\nrepresenting one at Fiddes Hill, figured in the fifth volume of\r\n'Archæologia,' which may be taken as a type of the rest. The sepulchral\r\ndeposit here, is no doubt, in the raised part, in front of the great\r\nstone, and not in the centre,--a peculiarity we have already had\r\noccasion to remark upon in the smaller circles at Stanton Drew and\r\nStennis. This, however, does not seem to have been always the case. The\r\ncircle, for instance, at Rayne, above alluded to, was excavated under\r\nthe superintendence of Mr. Stuart,[303] and found to contain in its\r\ncentre a pit, in which were \"a quantity of black mould, incinerated\r\nbones, and some bits of charcoal. Fragments of small urns were also\r\nfound, and all the usual accompaniments of a sepulchral deposit.\"\r\nIn concluding his account of it, Mr. Stuart says:--\"It is worthy of\r\nremark, that on the 2nd of May, 1349, William, Bishop of Aberdeen, held\r\na court at the Standing Stones of Rayne, at which the King's Justiciar\r\nwas present\" ('Regst. Episc. Aberd.' vol. i. p. 79, Spald. Club). Thus\r\nclearly proving not only the sepulchral nature of the circles, but the\r\nuse that was subsequently made of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 90. Circle at Fiddes Hill, 46 feet in diameter.]\r\n\r\nIf we may connect these stones at Rayne with the Newton stones, as\r\nColonel Forbes Leslie is inclined to do, we obtain a proof of a\r\npost-Christian date for this sepulchral circle, as well as a mediæval\r\nuse; and though I have no doubt that all this is correct, the mere\r\njuxtaposition of the sculptured stones and the circle hardly seems\r\nsufficient to rely upon.\r\n\r\nIn the Appendix to the Preface of the first volume of the 'Sculptured\r\nStones,' Mr. Stuart records excavations made in some fourteen circles,\r\nsimilar, or nearly so, to this one at Rayne; and in all sepulchral\r\ndeposits, more or less distinct, were found. In some, as in that of\r\nCrichie, before alluded to, a sepulchral deposit was found at the\r\nfoot of each of the six stones which surrounded it. Like many of our\r\nEnglish circles, this last was surrounded by a moat, in this instance\r\n20 feet wide and 6 feet deep, crossed by two entrances, as is Arbor\r\nLow and the Penrith circle, and within the moat stood the stones. As a\r\ngeneral rule, it may be asserted that all the Scotch circles, having\r\na diameter not exceeding 100 feet, when scientifically explored, have\r\nyielded evidences of sepulchral uses. Such, certainly, is the result\r\nof Mr. Stuart's experience, as detailed above; of Dr. Bryce's, in\r\nArran; of Mr. Dyce Nicol[304] and others, in Kincardine; and elsewhere.\r\nColonel Forbes Leslie informs me that he has not been so fortunate\r\nin some of those he mentioned in his lecture, which he either opened\r\nhimself or learnt the details of on the spot. Some of these he admits,\r\nhowever, had been opened before, others disturbed by cultivation;\r\nand altogether his experiences seem to be exceptional, and far from\r\nconclusive. The preponderance of evidence is so overwhelming on the one\r\nside, that we may be perfectly content to wait the explanation of such\r\nexceptional cases as these.\r\n\r\nThe Aberdeenshire circles are all found scattered singly, or at most in\r\npairs, in remote and generally in barren parts of the country; so that\r\nit is evident they neither marked battle-fields nor even cemeteries,\r\nbut can only be regarded as the graves of chiefs, or sometimes, it may\r\nbe, family sepulchres. There is one group, however, at Clava, about\r\nfive miles east from Inverness, which is of more than usual interest,\r\nbut regarding which the published accounts are neither so full nor so\r\nsatisfactory as could be wished.[305]\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Innes, the ruins of eight or nine cairns can still\r\nbe distinguished, though the whole of the little valley or depression\r\nin which they are situated seems strewn with blocks which may have\r\nbelonged to others, but which the advancing tide of cultivation has\r\nswept away. The most perfect of those now remaining are three at the\r\nwestern end of the valley, the two outer and larger cairns stand\r\nabout 100 yards apart. They are of stone, about 70 feet in diameter,\r\nsurrounded by a circle of upright stones measuring 100 feet across.\r\nThe intermediate one is smaller, being only 50 feet, with a circle\r\n80 feet in diameter.[306] The two extreme ones have been opened, and\r\nfound to contain circular chambers about 12 feet in diameter, and 9 in\r\nheight, with passages leading to them about 15 feet long and 2 feet\r\nwide; and in two or three instances the stones in them were adorned\r\nwith cup-marking, though it does not appear that they were otherwise\r\nsculptured.[307] In that to the west two sepulchral urns were found,\r\njust below the level of the original soil. They were broken, however,\r\nin extracting them; and they do not appear to have been put together\r\nagain or drawn, so that no conclusions can be deduced from them as to\r\nthe age of the cairns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 91. Plan of Clava Mounds. From Ordnance Survey. 25 inch\r\nscale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 92. View of Clava Mounds. From a drawing by Mr. Innes.]\r\n\r\nMeagre as this information is, it is sufficient to show that Clava\r\ndoes not mark a battle-field. Carefully-constructed chambers with\r\nhorizontally-vaulted roofs are not such monuments as soldiers erect\r\nin haste over the graves of their fallen chiefs. It evidently is a\r\ncemetery; and, with the knowledge we have acquired from the examination\r\nof those in Ireland, there cannot be much hesitation in ascribing it\r\nto that dynasty which was represented by King Brude, when St. Columba,\r\nin the sixth century, visited him in his \"Munitio,\" on the banks of\r\nthe Ness.[308] If King Brude were really converted to Christianity\r\nby Columba, it is by no means improbable that the small square\r\nenclosure at the west end of the \"heugh,\" which is still used as the\r\nburying-place of Pagan, or at least unbaptized babies, marked the spot\r\nwhere he and his successors were laid after the race had been weaned\r\nfrom the more noble burial-rites of their forefathers.\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely interesting to follow out this inquiry further,\r\nif the materials existed for so doing; as few problems are more\r\nperplexed, and at the same time, of their kind, more important, than\r\nthe origin of the Picts, and their relations with the Irish and the\r\nGaels. Language will not help us here: we know too little of that\r\nspoken by the Picts; but these monuments certainly would, if any\r\none would take the trouble to investigate the question by a careful\r\ncomparison of all those existing in Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 93. Stone at Coilsfield.]\r\n\r\nIn the south of Scotland, for instance, we find such a stone as this\r\nat Coilsfield, on the Ayr,[309] which, taking the difference of\r\ndrawing into account, is identical with that represented in woodcut\r\nNo. 71. There is the same circle, the same uncertain, wavy line,\r\nand generally the same character. Another was found at Annan-street,\r\nin Roxburghshire, and is so similar in pattern and drawing that if\r\nplaced in the chamber in the tumuli of New Grange, or Dowth, no one\r\nwould suspect that it was not in the place it was originally designed\r\nfor.[310] But no sculptures of that class have yet, at least, been\r\nbrought to light in Pictland, or, in other words, north of the Forth,\r\non the east side of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 94. Front of Stone at Aberlemmo, with Cross.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 95. Back of Stone at Aberlemmo.]\r\n\r\nThe sculptured stones of the Picts are, however, quite sufficient to\r\nprove a close affinity of race between the two peoples, but always\r\nwith a difference, which is evident on even a cursory examination.\r\nTo take one instance. There is a very beautiful stone at Aberlemmo,\r\nnear Brechin, which is said to have been put up to record the victory\r\ngained over the Danes at Loncarty, in the last years of the tenth\r\ncentury.[311] Be this as it may, there seems no reason for doubting\r\nthat it is a battle-stone, and does belong to the century in which\r\npopular tradition places it. On the front is a cross, but, like all\r\nin Scotland, without breaking the outline of the stone, which still\r\nretains a reminiscence of its Rude form. In Ireland, the arms of the\r\ncross as invariably extend beyond the line of the stone, like those at\r\nIona, which are Irish, and these are generally joined by a circular\r\nGlory. The ornaments on the cross are the same in both countries, and\r\ngenerally consist of that curious interlacing basket-work pattern so\r\ncommon also in the MSS. of that age in both countries, but which exist\r\nnowhere else, that I am aware of, except in Armenia.[312] The so-called\r\n\"key\" ornament on the horizontal arms of the cross at Aberlemmo seems\r\nalso of Eastern origin, as it is found in the Sarnath Tope, near\r\nBenares, and elsewhere, but is common to both countries; as is also the\r\ndragon ornament on the side of the cross, though this looks more like\r\na Scandinavian ornament than anything that can claim an origin further\r\neast.\r\n\r\nAmong the differences it may be remarked that the figure-subjects on\r\nIrish crosses almost invariably refer to the scenes of the Passion,\r\nor are taken from the Bible. On the Scotch stones, they as constantly\r\nrefer to battle or hunting incidents, or to what may be considered as\r\nevents in civil life. The essential difference, however, is, that, with\r\nscarcely an exception, the Pictish stones bear some of those emblems\r\nwhich have proved such a puzzle to antiquaries. The so-called broken\r\nsceptre, the brooch, and the altar, are seen in the Aberlemmo stone;\r\nbut in earlier examples they are far more important and infinitely\r\nvarious.[313] It may also be worthy of remark that the only two real\r\nround towers out of Ireland adorn the two Pictish capitals of Brechin\r\nand Abernethy. All this points to a difference that can well make\r\nus understand why St. Columba should have required an interpreter\r\nin speaking to the Picts;[314] but also to a resemblance that would\r\nlead us to understand that the cemetery at Clava was the counterpart\r\nof that on the banks of the Boyne, with the same relative degree of\r\nmagnificence as the Kings of Inverness bore to those of Tara; and if\r\nwe do not find similar tumuli at Brechin or Abernethy, it must be\r\nthat the kings of these provinces--if there were any--were converted\r\nto Christianity before they adopted this mode of burial. It may be\r\nsuggested that, as Maes-Howe is certainly the lineal descendant of\r\nthe monuments on the Boyne, it too must be a Celtic or Pictish tomb.\r\nFor the reasons, however, given above, such a theory seems wholly\r\nuntenable; but thus much may be granted, that such a tomb would\r\nprobably not have been erected, even by a Northman, in a country where\r\nthere was not an underlying Celtic or Pictish population.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 96. Cat Stone, Kirkliston.]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving these sculptured stones, it may be as well to point\r\nout one of those anomalies which meet us so frequently in these\r\nenquiries, and show how little ordinary probabilities suffice to guide\r\nto the true conclusion. Among the sculptured stones of Scotland,\r\none of the oldest is probably the Newton stone. It has at least an\r\nOghan inscription on its edge; and most antiquaries will admit that\r\nOghan engravings on stone were discontinued when alphabetic writing\r\nwas introduced and generally understood. It also has an alphabetic\r\ninscription on its face, but the letters are not Roman. They may be\r\nbad Greek, but certainly they appear to be pre-Roman, and therefore\r\nprobably the earliest Scotch inscription known. There is another stone\r\nat Kirkliston, near Edinburgh, which has a Latin inscription on it.\r\nIt is a \"cat\" or battle-stone, and records the name of Vetta, the\r\nson of Victis, in good Latin. Whether this Vetta is, or is not, the\r\ngrandfather of Hengist and Horsa, as Sir James Simpson contended,[315]\r\nis of no great consequence to our present argument. It is of about\r\ntheir age, and therefore as old as any of the other stones in Scotland;\r\nand there is also a third at Yarrow,[316] with a later inscription,\r\nwhich seems about the same age as the Lothian example. Now the curious\r\npart of this matter is, that having begun with alphabetic writing, they\r\nentirely discontinued it, and during the six or seven centuries through\r\nwhich these sculptured stones certainly extend, it is the rarest\r\npossible thing to find one with an alphabetic inscription; and why this\r\nshould be so is by no means clear. Take, for instance, the Aberlemmo\r\nstone just quoted. The people who erected it were Christians,--witness\r\nthe cross: the ornaments on it are almost identical with those found in\r\nIrish MSS. of the seventh and eighth centuries.[317] It is thus evident\r\nthat the persons who drew these ornaments could write, and being able\r\nto write and carve with such exquisite precision, it seems strange they\r\nnever thought of even putting the name of the persons who erected the\r\nstone or some word expressive of its purpose. The Irish probably would\r\nhave done so; and the Scandinavians would have covered them with Runes,\r\nas they did those they erected in the Isle of Man, though probably at\r\na somewhat later date. In the instance of the two crosses illustrated\r\nin the woodcuts, Nos. 97 and 98, the first bears an inscription to\r\nthe effect that \"Sandulf the Swarthy erected this cross to his wife,\r\nArnbjörg.\" From their names, both evidently of Scandinavian origin. The\r\ninscription on the side of the second runs thus: \"Mal Lumkun erected\r\nthis cross to his foster-father Malmor, or Mal Muru.\"[318] Both names\r\nof undoubted Gaelic derivation, thus showing that at that age at least\r\nany ethnographic theory that would give these stones exclusively to\r\neither race can hardly be maintained. The two races seem then to have\r\nfollowed the fashion of the day as they did in ruder times. Except\r\nin the instance of the St. Vigean's stone on which Sir James Simpson\r\nread the name of Drosten,[319] ascribing it with very fair certainty\r\nto the year 729 A.D., none of the 101 stones illustrated in\r\nthe splendid volumes of the Spalding Club contains hardly a scrap\r\nof alphabetic writing. Throughout they preferred a strange sort of\r\nHeraldic symbolism, which still defies the ingenuity of our best\r\nantiquaries to interpret. It was a very perverse course to pursue,\r\nbut while men did so, probably as late as Sueno's time, A.D.\r\n1008,[320] it is needless to ask why men set up rude stones to\r\ncommemorate events or persons when they could have carved or inscribed\r\nthem; or why, in fact, as we would insist on doing, they did not avail\r\nthemselves of all the resources of the art or the learning which they\r\npossessed?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 97. Cross in Isle of Man, bearing Runic Inscription.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 98. Cross in Isle of Man, bearing Runic Inscription.]\r\n\r\nThe other rude-stone monuments of Scotland are neither numerous nor\r\nimportant. Daniel Wilson enumerates some half-dozen of dolmens as still\r\nexisting in the lowlands and in parts of Argyllshire, but none of them\r\nare important from their size, nor do they present any peculiarities\r\nto distinguish them from those of Wales or Ireland; while no tradition\r\nhas attached itself to any of them in such a manner as to give a\r\nhint of their age or purpose. Besides these, there are a number of\r\nsingle stones scattered here and there over the country, but there is\r\nnothing to indicate whether they are cat stones or mark boundaries,\r\nor merely graves, so that to enumerate them would be as tedious as it\r\nwould be uninstructive. What little interest may attach to them will\r\nbe better appreciated when we have examined those of Scandinavia and\r\nFrance, which are more numerous, as well as more easily understood.\r\nWhen, too, we have mastered them in so far as the materials available\r\nenable us to do, we shall be able to appreciate the significance of\r\nmuch that has just been enunciated. Meanwhile it may be as well to\r\nremark that what we already seem to have gained is a knowledge that\r\na circle-building race came from the north, touching first at the\r\nOrkneys, and, passing down through the Hebrides, divided themselves on\r\nthe north of Ireland--one branch settling on the west coast of that\r\nisland, the other landing in Cumberland, and penetrating into England\r\nin a south-easterly direction.\r\n\r\nIn like manner we seem to have a dolmen-building race who from the\r\nsouth first touched in Cornwall, and thence spread northwards, settling\r\non both sides of St. George's Channel, and leaving traces of their\r\nexistence on the south and both coasts of Ireland, as well as in Wales\r\nand the west of England generally. Whether these two opposite currents\r\nwere or were not synchronous is a question that must be determined\r\nhereafter. We shall also be in a better position to ascertain what the\r\nraces were who thus spread themselves along our coasts, when we have\r\nexamined the only countries from which it is probable they could have\r\nissued.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 271: 'The Sculptured Stones of Scotland.'

Two years ago an\r\n    attempt was made to get the Government to anticipate the falling\r\n    in of the life interest, and appointing Mr. Stuart to the office\r\n    at once.

But their decision is\r\n    to be regretted; not only because we may thereby lose altogether\r\n    the services of the best qualified man in Scotland for the purpose,\r\n    but more so because the monuments are themselves fast disappearing\r\n    without any record of them being preserved.

No work has yet been published giving anything\r\nlike a statistical account of them, and no map exists showing their\r\ndistribution. What little information can be obtained regarding the\r\nDanish dolmens, and other similar monuments, is scattered through so\r\nmany volumes of transactions and detached essays that it is extremely\r\ndifficult to arrive at any connected view of them--almost, indeed,\r\nimpossible for any one who is not locally familiar with the provinces\r\nin which they are found. The truth seems to be that the Danish\r\nantiquaries have been so busy in arranging their microlithic treasures\r\nin glass cases that they have totally neglected their larger monuments\r\noutside. They have thus collected riches which no other nation\r\npossesses, and have constructed a very perfect grammar and vocabulary\r\nof the science. But a grammar and a dictionary are neither a history\r\nnor a philosophy; and though their labours may eventually be most\r\nuseful to future enquirers, they are of very little use for our present\r\npurposes. They have indeed up to this time been rather prejudicial than\r\notherwise, by leading people to believe that when they can distinguish\r\nbetween a flint or bronze or iron implement they know the alpha and\r\nomega of the science, and that nothing further is required to determine\r\nthe relative date of any given monument. It is as if we were to adopt\r\nthe simple chemistry of the ancients, and divide all known substances\r\ninto earth, water, fire, and air: a division not only convenient but\r\npractically so true that there is very little to be said against it. It\r\nis not, however, up to the mark of the knowledge of the day, and omits\r\nto take notice of the fact that earths can occasionally be converted\r\ninto gases, and airs converted into liquids or solidified. Instead of\r\ntheir simple system, what is now wanted is something that will take\r\ninto account the different races of mankind--some progressive, some\r\nthe reverse--and the different accidents of success and prosperity, or\r\ndisaster and poverty: the one leading to the aggregation of detached\r\ncommunities into great centres, and consequent progress; the other\r\nleading to dispersion and stagnation, if not retrocession, in the\r\narts of life which tend towards what we call civilization. At the\r\nInternational Congress of Prehistoric Archæology, held at Copenhagen in\r\nthe autumn of 1869, it was understood that many of the best Northern\r\nantiquaries were inclined to abandon, to a very considerable extent,\r\nthe hard and fast lines of their first system, and to admit not\r\nonly that there may be considerable overlapping, but even, in some\r\ninstances, that its indications were not in accordance with the facts.\r\nMore than two years have elapsed since the Congress was held, but the\r\nvolume containing the account of its proceedings is not yet published;\r\nwhen it is, we may probably be in a position to speak much more\r\nfavourably not only of their views but of the extent of their knowledge\r\nof the antiquities in question.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, we may congratulate ourselves in possessing\r\nsuch a work as that of Sjöborg.[321] He wrote, fortunately, before\r\nthe Danish system was invented, but, unfortunately, before drawing\r\nand engraving had reached the precision and clearness which now\r\ncharacterize them. In consequence of the last defect, we cannot always\r\nfeel sure of our ground in basing an argument on his drawings; but,\r\ngenerally speaking, he is so honest, so free from system, that there\r\nis very little danger in this respect. The work has also the merit of\r\nbeing as free from the speculations about Druids and Serpents which\r\ndisfigure the contemporary works of English antiquaries, as it is from\r\nthe three ages of the Danes; though, on the other hand, he relegates\r\nall the dolmens and such like monuments to a prehistoric \"Joter,\" or\r\ngiant race, who preceded, according to his views, Odin and his true\r\nScandinavians, to whom he ascribes all the truly historic monuments.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the difficulties arising from the paucity of information\r\nregarding the monuments, the Scandinavians have not yet made up\r\ntheir minds with regard to their early chronology. Even the vast\r\ncollections contained in the ponderous tomes of Langebeck and Suhm[322]\r\nare far from sufficing for the purpose; and such authors as Saxo\r\nGrammaticus[323] write with an easy fluency too characteristic of our\r\nown Jeffrey of Monmouth, and others who bury true history under such\r\na mass of fables as makes it extremely difficult to recover what we\r\nare really seeking for. Patient industry, combined with judicious\r\ncriticism, would, no doubt, clear away most of the obscurities which\r\nnow disfigure this page of mediæval history; but, meanwhile, the\r\nScandinavian annals are as obscure as the Irish, and more uncertain\r\nthan the contemporary annals of England.\r\n\r\nOf the history of Scandinavia anterior to the Christian era, absolutely\r\nnothing is known. It is now no longer admissible to believe in a\r\nhistoric Odin, whom all the mediæval historians represent as living in\r\nthe first century B.C., and as the founder of those families\r\nwho play so important a part in the subsequent histories of our own\r\nas well as of the whole group of Northern nations. The modern school\r\nof Germans has discovered that Odin was a god who lived in the sky\r\nin pre-Adamite times, and never condescended to visit our sublunary\r\nsphere. It is now rank heresy to assume that during the thousand years\r\nwhich elapsed between his pretended date and that of our earliest MSS.\r\nthe wild imaginings of barbarous tribes may not have gathered round the\r\nindistinct form of a national hero, transferred him back to a mythic\r\nage, and endowed him with the attributes and surroundings of a god. As\r\nthe Germans have decreed this, it is in vain to dispute it, and not\r\nworth while to attempt it here, as for our present purposes it is of\r\nthe least possible consequence.\r\n\r\nAbout the Christian era there is said to have been a king, called\r\nFrode I., who, as he never was deified, may have had a tomb on earth,\r\nand might, if that could be identified, be allowed to head our list.\r\nBetween him and Harald Harfagar, who, in 880, conquered Norway and came\r\ninto distinct contact with British history in the Orkneys, we have\r\nseveral lists of kings, more or less complete, and with dates more or\r\nless certain.[324] That there were kings in those days, no one will\r\nprobably dispute, nor perhaps is the succession of the names doubtful;\r\nand if the dates err to the extent of even fifty years or so, it is of\r\nlittle consequence to our argument. The monuments extend so far down,\r\nand to kings whose dates are so perfectly ascertained, that it is of\r\nno importance whether the earlier ones are assigned to dates forty or\r\nfifty years too early or too late. Their fixation may be left to future\r\nresearch, as it has no direct bearing on the theory we are now trying\r\nto investigate.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATTLE-FIELDS.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the Scandinavian monuments, and the most interesting\r\nfor our present object, comprise those groups of stones which mark\r\nbattle-fields. Not only are their dates generally known with sufficient\r\nprecision to throw considerable light on the question of the antiquity\r\nof such monuments in general, but they also illustrate, if they do\r\nnot determine, the use of many of the groups of stones we meet with\r\nin other countries. Sjöborg devotes ten plates in his first volume to\r\nthese battle-fields, illustrating twice that number of battles which\r\noccurred between the fifth and the twelfth centuries after Christ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 99. View of Battle-field at Kongsbacka. From Sjöborg.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these, at Kongsbacka, near the coast in Halland, though\r\nof somewhat uncertain date, is worth quoting from its similarity to\r\nthe alignments on Dartmoor, Ashdown, Karnac, and elsewhere, though,\r\nunfortunately, no plan or dimensions are given. On the hills beyond is\r\na tumulus called the grave of Frode, and on the plain a conspicuous\r\nstone bears his name; but whether this was Frode V. (400) or some\r\nother Frode is not clear. Sjöborg assigns it to a date about 500, and\r\nthere seems very little reason to doubt he is at least approximatively\r\ncorrect.[325]\r\n\r\nThe second battle-field illustrated is similar to the last, except\r\nin the form of the stones, which seem to belong to a different\r\nmineralogical formation.[326] They are plainly, however, seen to be\r\narranged in circles and lines, and are even more like forms with which\r\nwe are familiar elsewhere. It is said to represent a battle-field in\r\nwhich the Swedish king Adil fought the Danish Snio, and in which the\r\nlatter with the chiefs Eskil and Alkil were slain. As all these names\r\nare familiarly known in the mediæval history of these countries there\r\ncan be no great difficulty in ascribing this battle also to about the\r\nsame age as that at Kongsbacka.\r\n\r\nWith the third we tread on surer ground. No event in the history of\r\nthese lands is better known than the fight on the Braavalla Heath, in\r\nÖstergothland, where the blind old king, Harald Hildetand, met his\r\nfate in the year 736, or 750 according to others. As the Saga tells\r\nus, Odin had, when the king was young, taught him a form of tactics\r\nwhich gave him a superiority in battle over all his enemies; but the\r\ngod having withdrawn his favour from him, he fell before the prowess of\r\nhis nephew, Sigurd Ring, to whom the god had communicated the secret of\r\nthe battle array. It does not appear to admit of doubt that the circles\r\nshown in the cut in the opposite page were erected to commemorate\r\nthis event, and that they contain the bodies of those who were slain\r\nin this action; and if this is so, it throws considerable light on\r\nthe battle-fields of Moytura, illustrated woodcuts Nos. 54 to 61. The\r\ncircles on Braavalla are generally from 20 to 40 feet in diameter,\r\nand consequently are, on the average, smaller than those at Moytura;\r\nthey are also more numerous, unless we adopt Petrie's suggestion,[327]\r\nthat there must originally have been at least two hundred in the Irish\r\nfield; and if so, it is the smaller ones that would certainly be\r\nthe first to be cleared away, so that the similarity may originally\r\nhave been greater than it now is--so great, indeed, as to render it\r\ndifficult to account for the fact that two battle-fields should have\r\nbeen marked out in a manner so similar when so long a time as seven\r\ncenturies had elapsed between them. As it does not appear possible\r\nthat the date of the Braavalla fight can be shifted to the extent of\r\nfifty years either way, are we deceiving ourselves about Moytura? Is it\r\npossible that it represents some later descent of Scandinavian Vikings\r\non the west coast of Ireland, and that the cairn on Knocknarea--\r\n\r\n  \"High and broad,\r\n  By the sailors over the waves\r\n  To be seen afar,\r\n  The beacon of the war renowned\"[328]--\r\n\r\nwhich they built up during ten days--is really the grave of some\r\nNorthern hero who fell in some subsequent fight at Carrowmore? That\r\nall these are monuments of the same class, and belong, if not to the\r\nsame people, at least to peoples in close contact with one another,\r\nand having similar faiths and feelings, does not appear to admit of\r\ndoubt. When, however, we come to look more closely at them, there are\r\npeculiarities about them which may account for even so great a lapse\r\nof time. The Braavalla circles are smaller, and on the whole perhaps,\r\nwe may assume, degenerate. There are square and triangular graves,\r\nand other forms, which, so far as we know, are comparatively modern\r\ninventions, and, altogether, there are changes which may account for\r\nthat lapse of time; but that more than seven centuries elapsed between\r\nthe two seems to be most improbable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 100. Part of the Battle-field of Braavalla Heath. From\r\nSjöborg.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 101. Harald Hildetand's Tomb at Lethra.[329]]\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to King Hildetand. According to the saga, \"After\r\nthe battle the conqueror, Sigurd Ring, caused a search to be made for\r\nthe body of his uncle. The body when found was washed and placed in the\r\nchariot in which Harald had fought, and transported into the interior\r\nof a tumulus which Sigurd had caused to be raised. Harald's horse was\r\nthen killed and buried in the mound with the saddle of Ring, so that\r\nthe king might at pleasure proceed to Walhalla either in his chariot\r\nor on horseback. Ring then gave a great funeral feast, and invited all\r\nthe nobles and warriors present to throw into the mound great rings\r\nand noble armour, in honour of the king Harald. They then closed up\r\nthe mound with care.\"[330] This mound still exists at Lethra's Harald,\r\ncapital in Seeland. It was mentioned by Saxo Grammaticus in 1236,[331]\r\nand described and drawn by Olaus Wormius in 1643;[332] and no one ever\r\ndoubted its identity, till recently the Museum authorities caused\r\nexcavations to be made. Unfortunately some \"wedges of flint\" have\r\nbeen found in the earth which was extracted from the chamber, from\r\nwhich Worsaae and his brother antiquaries at once concluded that \"it is\r\nbeyond all doubt merely a common cromlech of the stone period\"[333]--a\r\nconclusion that seems to me the reverse of logical. No one, I presume,\r\ndoubts that King Hildetand was buried in a tumulus with rings and\r\narms; and if this tumulus was regarded historically as his, for the\r\nlast 600 years, and traditionally so from the time of his death, it is\r\nincumbent upon the antiquaries to show how worthless these traditions\r\nand histories are, and to point out where he really rests. To form\r\nan empirical system and to assert--which they cannot prove--that no\r\nflint implements were used after a certain prehistoric date, and\r\nthat consequently all mounds in which flint implements are found are\r\nprehistoric, seems most unreasonable, to say the least of it. It would\r\nbe surely far more philosophical to admit that flint may have been\r\nused down to any time till we can find some reason for fixing a date\r\nfor its discontinuance. In this instance an \"instantia crucis\" would\r\nbe to dig into some of the circles at Braavalla, and see if any flints\r\nare to be found there. No metal was found at Moytura, though metal\r\nwas, if history is to be depended upon, then commonly used, and flint\r\nimplements were probably not found because those who opened the tombs\r\nwere not aware of its importance. Pending this test, the form of the\r\ngrave may give us some indication of its age. It is an oblong barrow,\r\nwith an external dolmen at one end, and with a row of ten stones on\r\neach side, the two end ones being taller than the rest. A similar\r\nmound, known as the Kennet long barrow, exists at Avebury,[334] so\r\nsimilar indeed that if this tomb at Lethra is historical so certainly\r\nis the English example. If, on the other hand, either can be proved to\r\nbelong to the long forgotten past, the other must also he consigned to\r\nthe same unsatisfactory limbo.\r\n\r\nThe barrow at West Kennet was carefully explored in 1859 by Dr.\r\nThurnam, and the results of his investigation fully detailed in a\r\npaper in the 'Archæologia,' vol. xxxviii., from which the following\r\nparticulars are abstracted, together with some others from a second\r\npaper, \"On Long Barrows,\" by the same author, in vol. xlii. of the same\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nExternally it is a mound measuring 336 feet in length by 75 feet at\r\nits broadest part. Originally it was surrounded by what is called a\r\nperistalith of tall stones, between which, it is said, a walling of\r\nsmaller stones can still be detected. On its summit, as at Lethra, was\r\nan external dolmen over the principal chamber of the tomb. The chamber\r\nwas nearly square in form, measuring 8 feet by 9, and approached by\r\na passage measuring 15 feet by 3 feet 6 inches in width; and its\r\narrangement is in fact the same as that of the Jersey tumulus (woodcut\r\nNo. 11), and, as Sir John Lubbock remarks, \"very closely resembles\r\nthat of a tumulus\" he had just been describing, of the Stone age,\r\nin the island of Möen, \"and, in fact, the plan of passage graves\r\ngenerally.\"[335]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 102. Long Barrow, Kennet, restored by Dr. Thurnam.\r\n'Archæologia,' xlii.]\r\n\r\nWhen opened, six original interments were found in the chamber, under\r\na stratum of black, sooty, greasy matter, 3 to 9 inches in thickness,\r\nand which, Dr. Thurnam remarks, \"could never have been disturbed since\r\nthe original formation of the deposit\" (p. 413). Two of these had\r\ntheir skulls fractured during lifetime; the others were entire. To\r\naccount for this, Dr. Thurnam takes considerable pains to prove that\r\nslaves were sometimes sacrificed at the funeral of their masters, but\r\nhe fails to find any instance in which they were killed by breaking\r\ntheir heads; and if they were to serve their master in the next\r\nworld, even a savage would be shrewd enough to know that cracking his\r\nskull was not the way to render him useful for service either in this\r\nworld or the next. No such mode of sacrifice was ever adopted, so far\r\nas I know.[336] But supposing it was so, all the six burials in this\r\ntomb seem to have been nearly equal, and equally honourable, and why,\r\ntherefore, all their skulls were not broken is not clear. If on the\r\nother hand we assume that it is the grave of six persons who were\r\nslain in battle, two by blows on the head, and four by wounds in the\r\nbody, this surely would be a simpler way of accounting for the facts\r\nobserved. Even, however, if we were to admit that these men with the\r\nbroken heads were sacrificed, this would by no means prove the grave to\r\nbe prehistoric. Quite the contrary, for we know from the indisputable\r\nauthority of a decree of Charlemagne that human sacrifices were\r\npractised by the pagan Saxons as late, certainly, as 789,[337] and were\r\nsufficiently frequent to constitute one of the first crimes against\r\nwhich he fulminated his edicts. The fact is that neither historians\r\nnor antiquaries seem quite to realise the state of utter barbarism\r\ninto which the greater part of Europe was plunged between the collapse\r\nof the Roman Empire and the revival of order under Charlemagne.\r\nChristianity no doubt had taken root in some favoured spots, and some\r\nbright lights shone out of the general darkness, but over the greater\r\npart of Europe pagan rites were still practised to such an extent as\r\neasily to account for any heathen practice or any ancient form of\r\nsepulture which may be found anywhere existing.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to our long barrow. Under a piece of Sarsen stone,\r\nbut on the skull of one of the principal persons interred here (No.\r\n4), were found two pieces of black pottery (fig. 8, page 415), which\r\nDr. Thurnam admits may be of the Roman age. Other fragments of the\r\nsame vessel were found in other parts of the tomb, and also fragments\r\nof pottery (figs. 14 to 17), not British, but to which he hesitates to\r\nassign an age. So far as I can judge, it seems just such pottery as the\r\nless experienced British potters would form, on Roman models, after\r\nthe departure of that people. But this is immaterial; for beyond the\r\nchamber, and deeper consequently into the tumulus, were found fragments\r\nof undoubted Roman pottery. So far, therefore, everything favours\r\nthe view that it was the sepulchre of persons slain in battle, after\r\nthe departure of the Romans; for we can hardly believe that a battle\r\nwould be fought, and such a tomb raised over the slain, during their\r\noccupation; and if so, as the pottery proves it could not be before, a\r\nchoice of a date is fixed within very narrow limits. It may either have\r\nbeen in 450, immediately after the departure of the Romans, or in 520,\r\nthe date of the battle of Badon Hill, which is the time at which, I\r\nbelieve, it was reared. So far as the general argument is concerned, it\r\nis of no consequence which date is chosen. Against this conclusion we\r\nhave to place the following facts. First, no trace of iron or bronze,\r\nor of metal of any sort, was found in the tomb. Secondly, at least 300\r\nflint fragments were found in it. Some of these were mere chippings,\r\nsome cones, but many were fairly formed flint implements (figs. 10 to\r\n13),[338] not belonging to the oldest type, but such as antiquaries are\r\nin the habit of ascribing to the pre-metal Stone age. In addition to\r\nthese, the quantity of coarse native pottery was very remarkable. No\r\nwhole vessels were found, but broken fragments that would form fifty\r\nvessels were heaped in a corner; and there were corresponding fragments\r\nin another corner. Dr. Thurnam tries to explain this by referring to\r\nthe passage in the grave scene in 'Hamlet,' where our great dramatist\r\nspeaks of \"shards, flints, and pebbles,\" which should be thrown into\r\nthe graves of suicides; the use of which, he adds, \"in mediæval times\r\nmay be a relic of paganism.\" It does not, however, seem to occur to him\r\nthat, if such a custom was known in the sixteenth century, it would be\r\nlikely to have been in full force in the sixth. It is strange enough\r\nthat such a custom, even if only referred to suicides, should have\r\nsurvived a thousand years of such revolutions and changes of religion\r\nas England was subjected to in those days; but that it should be known\r\nto Christians, after 3000 or 4000 years' disuse, seems hardly possible.\r\n\r\nNo argument, it appears to me, can be drawn from the different kinds of\r\npottery found in the tomb. If any one will take the trouble of digging\r\nup the kitchen midden of a villa built within the last ten years, in\r\na previously uninhabited spot, he will probably find fragments of an\r\nexquisite porcelain vase which the housemaid broke in dusting the\r\ndrawing-room chimney-piece. He will certainly find many fragments of\r\nthe stoneware used in the dining-room, and with them, probably, some of\r\nthe coarser ware used in the dairy, and mixed with these innumerable\r\n\"shards\" of the flower-pots used in the conservatory. According to\r\nthe reasoning customary among antiquaries, this midden must have been\r\naccumulating during 2000 or 3000 years at least, because it would\r\nhave taken all that time, or more, before the rude pottery of the\r\nflower-pots could have been developed into the exquisite porcelain\r\nof the drawing-room vase. The argument is, in fact, the same as that\r\nwith respect to the flints. It may be taken for granted that men used\r\nimplements of bone and stone before they were acquainted with the\r\nuse of metal; but what is disputed is that they ceased to use them\r\nimmediately after becoming familiar with either bronze or iron. So with\r\nearthenware: men no doubt used coarse, badly formed, and badly burnt\r\npottery before they could manufacture better; but, even when they could\r\ndo so, it is certain that they did not cease the employment of pottery\r\nof a very inferior class; and we have not done so to the present day.\r\nTo take one instance among many. There are in the Museum of the Society\r\nof Antiquaries at Edinburgh a series of vessels, hand-made and badly\r\nburnt, and which might easily be mistaken--and often are--for those\r\nfound in prehistoric tombs. Yet they were made and used in the Shetland\r\nIslands in the last and even in the present century.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter seems to be that, as in the case of a find of\r\ncoins, it is the date of the last piece that fixes the time of the\r\ndeposit. There may be coins in it a hundred or a thousand years older,\r\nbut this hoard cannot have been buried before the last piece which it\r\ncontains was coined. So it is with this barrow. The presence of Roman\r\nor post-Roman pottery in an avowedly undisturbed sepulchre fixes,\r\nbeyond doubt, the age before which the skeletons could not have been\r\ndeposited where they were found by Dr. Thurnam. The presence of flints\r\nand coarse pottery only shows, but it does so most convincingly, how\r\nutterly groundless the data are on which antiquaries have hitherto\r\nfixed the age of these monuments. It proves certainly that flints and\r\nshards were deposited in tombs in Roman or post-Roman times; and if\r\nthere is no mistake in Dr. Thurnam's data, this one excavation is, by\r\nitself, sufficient to prove that the Danish theory of the three ages\r\nis little better than the \"baseless fabric\" of--if not \"a vision\"--at\r\nleast of an illusion, which, unless Dr. Thurnam's facts can be\r\nexplained away, has no solid foundation to rest upon.\r\n\r\nIf any systematic excavations had been undertaken in the Scandinavian\r\nlong barrows, it would not, perhaps, be necessary to adduce English\r\nexamples to illustrate their age or peculiarities. Several are adduced\r\nby Sjöborg, but none are reported as opened. This one, for instance,\r\nis externally like the long barrow at West Kennet, and, if Sjöborg's\r\ninformation is to be depended upon, is one of several which mark the\r\nspot where Frode V. (460-494) landed in Sweden, where a battle was\r\nfought, and those who fell in it were buried in these mounds, or where\r\nthe Bauta stones mark their graves. If this is so, the form of the\r\nlong barrow with its peristalith was certainly not unknown in the\r\nfifth century; and there is no improbability of its being employed in\r\nEngland also in that age. In settling these questions, however, the\r\nScandinavians have an immense advantage over us. All their mounds have\r\nnames and dates; they may be true or they may be false, but they give a\r\nstarting-point and an interest to the enquiry which are wanting in this\r\ncountry, but which, it is hoped, will one day enable the Northmen to\r\nreconstruct their monumental history on a satisfactory basis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 103. Long Barrow at Wiskehärad, in Halland. From a\r\ndrawing by Sjöborg.]\r\n\r\nIn most cases antiquaries in this country have been content to appeal\r\nto the convenient fiction of secondary interments to account for the\r\nperplexing contradictions in which their system everywhere involves\r\nthem. In the instance of the Kennet long barrow there is no excuse\r\nfor such a suggestion. All the interments were of one age, and that\r\nundoubtedly the age of the chamber in which they were found, and the\r\npottery and flints could not have been there before nor introduced\r\nafterwards. Indeed, I do not know a single instance of an undoubtedly\r\nsecondary interment, unless it is in the age of Canon Greenwell's\r\nreally prehistoric tumuli. When he publishes his researches, we shall\r\nbe in a condition to ascertain how far they bear on the theory.[339]\r\nIn the chambered tumuli secondary interments seem never to occur; and\r\nnothing is more unlikely than that they should. As Dr. Thurnam himself\r\nstates: \"In three instances at least Mr. Cunnington and Sir R. C. Hoare\r\nfound in long barrows skeletons which, from their extended position and\r\nthe character of the iron weapons accompanying them, were evidently\r\nAnglo-Saxon.\"[340] A simple-minded man would consequently fancy that\r\nthey were Anglo-Saxon graves, for what can be more improbable than\r\nthat the proud conquering Saxons would be content to bury their dead\r\nin the graves of the hated and despised Celts whom they were busy in\r\nexterminating.[341]\r\n\r\nIf the above reasoning is satisfactory and sufficient to prove that\r\nthe long barrow at West Kennet is of post-Roman times, it applies also\r\nto Rodmarton, Uley, Stoney Littleton, and all the Gloucestershire long\r\nbarrows which, for reasons above given (_ante_, page 164), we ventured\r\nto assign to a post-Roman period; and _à fortiori_ it carries with\r\nit King Hildetand's tomb at Lethra. It is true we have not the same\r\ndirect means of judging of its date as we have of our own monuments.\r\nThe Danes treat with such supreme contempt any monument that does not\r\nat once fall in with their system, that they will not even condescend\r\nto explore it. So soon as Worsaae found some \"flint wedges\" in the\r\ntomb, he at once decreed that it was prehistoric, and that it was\r\nno use searching farther; and we are consequently left to this fact\r\nand its external similarities for our identification. Here, again,\r\nis a difficulty. The two drawings above given (woodcuts Nos. 101 and\r\n102) may show them too much alike or exaggerate differences. The\r\none is an old drawing from nature, the other a modern restoration;\r\nstill the essential facts are undoubted. Both are chambered long\r\nbarrows, ornamented by rows of tall stones, either partially or wholly\r\nsurrounding their base, and both have external dolmens on their summit,\r\nand both contain flint implements. If this is so, the difficulty is\r\nrather to account for so little change having taken place in 230 years\r\nthan to feel any surprise at their not being identical. The point upon\r\nwhich we wish to insist here is that they are both post-Roman, and may\r\nconsequently belong to any age between Arthur and Charlemagne.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe remaining battle-fields of which representations are given in\r\nSjöborg are scarcely so interesting as that at Braavalla, which with\r\nthe tomb of the king slain there are landmarks in our enquiry. If those\r\ncircles on Braavalla Heath do mark the battle-field, and that tomb at\r\nLethra is the one in which the blind old king was laid--neither of\r\nwhich facts I see any reason for doubting--all difficulties based on\r\nthe assumed improbability of the monuments being so modern as I am\r\ninclined to make them are removed, and each case must stand or fall\r\naccording to the evidence that can be adduced for or against its age.\r\nTo return, however, to the battle-fields given by Sjöborg. Figures 43\r\nand 44 represent two groups of circles and Bauta stones near Hwitaby,\r\nin Malmö. These are said to mark two battle-fields, in which Ragnar\r\nLothbrok gained victories over his rebellious subjects in Scania:\r\nSjöborg says in 750 and 762, as he adopts a chronology fifty years\r\nearlier than Suhm. But be this as it may, there does not seem any\r\nreason for doubting but that these stones do mark fields where battles\r\nwere fought in the eighth century, and that Ragnar Lothbrok took part\r\nin them. These groups are much less extensive than those at Braavalla,\r\nbut are so similar that they cannot be distant from them in age.\r\n\r\nAt Stiklastad, in Norway, in the province of Drontheim, a battle was\r\nfought, in 1030, between Knut the Great and Olof the Holy; and close\r\nto this is a group of forty-four circles of stones, which Sjöborg\r\nseems, but somewhat doubtfully, to connect with this battle. But about\r\nthe next one (fig. 49) there seems no doubt. The Danish prince Magnus\r\nHenricksson killed Erik the Holy, and was slain by Carl Sverkersson,\r\nin the year 1161, at Uppland, in Denmark; and the place is marked\r\nby twenty stone circles and ovals, most of them enclosing mounds\r\nand two square enclosures, 30 to 40 feet in diameter. They are not,\r\nconsequently, in themselves very important, but are interesting, if\r\nthe adscription is correct, as showing how this heathenish custom\r\nlasted even after Christianity must have been fairly established in the\r\ncountry. Another group (fig. 51) is said to mark the spot where, in\r\n1150, a Swedish heroine, Blenda, overcame the Danish king Swen Grate,\r\nand the spot is marked by circles and Bauta stones; one, in front of a\r\ntumulus, bears a Runic inscription, though it merely says that Dedrik\r\nand Tunne raised the stone to Rumar the Good.\r\n\r\nOnly one other group need be mentioned here. On a spot of land, in the\r\nisland of Freyrsö, off the entrance of the Drontheim Fiord, in the year\r\n958, Hakon, the son of Harald Harfagar, overthrew his nephews, the sons\r\nof Erik Blodoxe, in three battles. The first and second of these, as\r\nshown in the plan (woodcut No. 104), are marked by cairns and mounds;\r\nand the third by eight large barrows, three of which are of that shape\r\nknown in Scandinavia as ship barrows, and measure from 100 to 140 feet\r\nin length. There are also three tumuli at 4 in the woodcut, in one\r\nof which one of Erik Blodoxe's sons is said to be buried. It is not\r\nclear whether the five large mounds that stud the plain do not cover\r\nthe remains of those also who fell in this fight. It does not appear\r\nthat any excavations have been made in them. The interest of this\r\nbattle-field to us is not so much because it shows the persistence\r\nof this plan of marking battle-fields at so late a date--later ones\r\nhave just been quoted--but because all the actors in the scene are\r\nfamiliar to us from the part they took in the transactions in the\r\nOrkneys in the tenth century. If they, in their own country, adhered\r\nto these old-world practices, we should not be astonished at their\r\nhaving erected circles or buried in mounds in their new possessions. It\r\nis true that none of these Scandinavian circles can compare in extent\r\nwith the Standing Stones of Stennis or the Ring of Brogar, but this\r\nwould not be the first time that such a thing has happened. The Greeks\r\nerected larger and, in proportion to the population, more numerous\r\nDoric temples in Sicily than they possessed in their own country;\r\nand the Northmen may have done the same thing in Orcadia, where they\r\npossessed a conquered, probably an enslaved, race to execute these\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 104. Battle-field at Freyrsö. From Sjöborg, vol. i. pl.\r\n16.]\r\n\r\nTUMULI.\r\n\r\nThe number of sepulchral mounds in Scandinavia is very great, and\r\nsome of them are very important; but, so far as I can ascertain, very\r\nfew have been explored, and, until interrogated by the spade, nothing\r\ncan well be less communicative than a simple mound of earth. A map of\r\ntheir distribution might, no doubt, throw considerable light on the\r\nethnography of the country, and tell us whether the Finns or Lapps\r\nwere their original authors, or whether the Slaves or Wends were their\r\nintroducers; and, lastly, whether the true Scandinavians brought them\r\nwith them from other lands, or merely adopted them from the original\r\ninhabitants, in which case they can only be treated as survivals.\r\nFunereal pomp, or tomb-building of any sort, is so antagonistic to\r\nthe habits of any people so essentially Teutonic as the Scandinavians\r\nwere and are, that we cannot understand their adopting these forms, or\r\nindeed stone circles or monuments of any class, in a country where they\r\nhad not previously existed. If we assume that the modern Scandinavians\r\nwere German tribes who conquered the country from the Cimbri or the\r\nearlier Lapps and Finns, and did so as warriors, bringing no women\r\nwith them, the case is intelligible enough. Under these circumstances,\r\nthey must have intermarried with the natives of the country, and would\r\neventually, after a few generations, lose much of their individual\r\nnationality, and adopt many of the customs of the people among whom\r\nthey settled, using them only in a more vigorous manner and on a larger\r\nscale than their more puny predecessors had been able to adopt.[342]\r\nIt is most improbable that the \"Northmen,\" if Germans--as indeed their\r\nlanguage proves them to be--should ever have invented such things as\r\ntumuli, dolmens, circles, or any other such un-Aryan forms, in any\r\ncountry where they had not existed previously to their occupying it;\r\nbut that as immigrants they should adopt the customs of the previous\r\noccupants of the land is only what we find happening everywhere. The\r\nsettlement of these points will be extremely interesting for the\r\nethnography of Northern Europe, and ought not to be difficult whenever\r\nthe problem is fairly grappled with. In the meanwhile, all that the\r\ninformation at present available will enable us to do here is to\r\nrefer to some tumuli whose contents bear more or less directly on the\r\nargument which is the principal object of this work.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is the triple group at Upsala, now popularly\r\nknown as the graves of Thor, Wodin, and Freya. It may illustrate the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining correct information regarding these monuments\r\nto state that, even so late as 1869, Sir John Lubbock, who is generally\r\nso well informed, and had such means of obtaining information, did\r\nnot know that they had been opened.[343] I was aware of a passage in\r\nMarryatt's travels in Sweden in which, writing on the spot, he asserts\r\nthat one of them had been opened, and that \"in its 'giant's chamber'\r\nwere found the bones of a woman, and, among other things, a piece of a\r\ngold filagree bracelet, richly ornamented in spiral decoration, some\r\ndice, and a chessman, either the king or a knight.\"[344] Wishing,\r\nhowever, for further information, I obtained an introduction to Mr.\r\nHans Hildebrand, who gave me the following information. Subsequently\r\nI received a letter from Professor Carl Säve, of Upsala, who kindly\r\nabstracted for me the only published accounts of the excavations as\r\nthey appeared in a local paper at the time. These were forwarded to me\r\nby Professor Geo. Stephens, of Copenhagen, who also was so obliging as\r\nto translate them. They are so interesting that I have printed them,\r\nas they stand, as Appendix B. From these two documents the following\r\naccount is compiled, and may be thoroughly depended upon.\r\n\r\nOne of the mounds, known as that of Wodin, was opened, in 1846, under\r\nthe superintendence of Herr Hildebrand, the royal antiquary of Sweden.\r\nIt was soon found that the mounds were situated on a ridge of gravel,\r\nso that the tunnel had to take an upward, direction. At the junction\r\nof the natural with the artificial soil, a cairn was found of closely\r\ncompacted stones, each about as large as a man could lift. In the\r\ncentre of the cairn the burial urn was found in the grave-chamber,\r\ncontaining calcined bones, ashes, fragments of bronze ornaments\r\ndestroyed by fire, and a fragment of a gold ornament delicately\r\nwrought. Within the cairn, but a little away from the urn, were found\r\na heap of dogs' bones, equally calcined by fire, and fragments of\r\ntwo golden bracteates. \"The workmanship of the gold ornaments,\" Herr\r\nHildebrand adds, \"closely resembles that of the gold bracteates of the\r\nfifth or sixth centuries, and, with the fragments of these peculiar\r\nornaments themselves, settles a date before which these mounds could\r\nnot have been raised.\" How much later they may be, it is not easy\r\nto conjecture, without at least seeing the bracteates, which do not\r\nseem to have been published. With a little local industry, I have\r\nvery little doubt, not only that the date of these tombs could be\r\nascertained, but the names of the royal personages who were therein\r\nburied, probably in the sixth or seventh century of our era.\r\n\r\n\"The tombs of Central Sweden,\" Herr Hildebrand adds, \"are generally\r\nconstructed in the same way, the urn containing the bones being placed\r\non the surface of the soil, at the place of cremation or elsewhere,\r\nas the case may be. Generally, nothing is found with them but an\r\niron nail, or some such trifling object\"--a curious and economical\r\nreminiscence of the extravagant customs of their predecessors.\r\nAccording to him, \"almost every village in Sweden, with the exception\r\nof those in some mountain-districts and the most northern provinces,\r\nhas a tomb-field quite close to the side of the houses. The antiquities\r\nfound in the mounds of these tomb-fields all belong to the Iron age.\r\nThe tombs of the earlier ages have no connection with the homesteads of\r\nthe present people.\"\r\n\r\nHow far these tombs extend downwards in date cannot be ascertained\r\nwithout a much more careful examination than they have yet been\r\nsubjected to. It may safely, however, be assumed that they continued\r\nto be used till the conversion of the inhabitants to Christianity, and\r\nprobably even for some considerable time afterwards, for such a custom\r\nis not easily eradicated.\r\n\r\nIt would be as tedious as unprofitable to attempt to enumerate the\r\nvarious mounds which have been opened, for their contents throw little\r\nor no light on our enquiry; and being distributed in cases in the\r\nmuseum, not according to their localities or traditions, but according\r\nto their systematic classes, it is almost impossible to restore them\r\nnow to their places in history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 105. Dragon on King Gorm's Stone, Jellinge. From 'An.\r\nNord. Oldkund.' xii. 1852.]\r\n\r\nAt Jellinge, however, on the east coast of Jutland, there are two\r\nmounds, always known traditionally as those of Gorm the Old and his\r\nqueen Thyra Danebod--the Beloved. The date of Gorm's death seems now\r\nto be accepted as 950 A.D.;[345] but it is not clear whether\r\nhe erected the tomb himself, or whether it is due to the filial piety\r\nof his son Harald Blaatand, or Blue-Tooth, and in which case its date\r\nwould be 968.[346] Saxo Grammaticus at least tells us that he buried\r\nhis mother in the tumulus, and then set a whole army of men and oxen\r\nat work to remove from the Jutland shore an immense stone--a little\r\nrock--and bring it to the place where his mother lay inhumed.[347]\r\nThat stone still exists, and has sculptured on one side a dragon,\r\nwhich calls forcibly to our mind that found on Maes-Howe (woodcut No.\r\n85), and on the other side a figure, which is, no doubt, intended to\r\nrepresent Christ on the cross. On the two sides are Runic inscriptions,\r\nin which he records his affection for his father and mother and his\r\nconversion to the Christian faith.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can ascertain, the tomb of King Gorm has not yet been\r\nopened. That of Thyra was explored many years ago--in 1820 apparently;\r\nbut no sections or details have been published, so that it is\r\nextremely difficult to ascertain even the dimensions. Engelhardt\r\nreports the height as 43 feet, and the diameter as 240 feet;[348]\r\nWorsaae gives the height as 75 feet, and the diameter as 180 feet, and\r\nhe is probably correct.[349] But in Denmark anything that cannot be put\r\ninto a glass case in a museum is so completely rejected as valueless\r\nthat no one cares to record it. When entered, it was found that it\r\nhad been plundered probably in the middle ages, and all that remained\r\nwere the following articles:--A small silver goblet, lined with gold\r\non the inside, and ornamented with interlaced dragons on the exterior;\r\nsome fibulæ, tortoise-shaped, and ornamented with fantastic heads of\r\nanimals; some buckle-heads, and other objects of no great value. The\r\nchamber in which these objects were found measured 23 feet in length by\r\n8 feet 3 inches in width, and was 5 feet high;[350] the walls and roof,\r\nformed of massive slabs of oak, were originally, it appears, hung with\r\ntapestries, but these had nearly all perished.\r\n\r\nNot only are these monuments of Gorm and Thyra interesting in\r\nthemselves, and deserving of much more attention than the Danes have\r\nhitherto bestowed upon them, but they are most important in their\r\nbearing on the general history of monuments of this class. In the\r\nfirst place, their date and destination are fixed beyond dispute, and\r\nthis being so, the only ground is taken away on which any _à priori_\r\nargument could be based with regard to the age of any mound anterior\r\nto the tenth century. As soon as it is realised that sepulchral mounds\r\nhave been erected in the tenth century, it is impossible to argue that\r\nit is unlikely or improbable that Silbury Hill or any other mound in\r\nEngland may not belong to the sixth or any subsequent century down to\r\nthat time. The argument is, however, even more pertinent with reference\r\nto Maes-Howe and other tumuli in the Orkneys. If the Scandinavian kings\r\nwere buried in \"howes\" down to the year 1000--I believe they extend\r\nmuch beyond that date--it is almost certain that the Orcadian Jarls\r\nwere interred in similar mounds down at least to their conversion to\r\nChristianity (A.D. 986). Whether Maes-Howe was erected as\r\na sepulchre for the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok, as John Stuart seems to\r\ninfer from the inscriptions,[351] or of Havard Earl, as I have above\r\nattempted to show, is of little consequence to the general argument.\r\nThat it was the grave of a Scandinavian Jarl, erected between 800 and\r\n1000 A.D., seems quite certain, and my own impression is that\r\nit is almost as certainly the tomb of the individual Jarl to whom I\r\nhave ventured to ascribe it.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, no argument against these views can be drawn\r\nfrom the fact that Thyra's tomb is lined with slabs of oak, while the\r\nchamber at Maes-Howe is formed with stone. The difference of the two\r\nlocalities is sufficient to account for this. Denmark has always been\r\nfamous for its forests, and especially on the shores of the Baltic, at\r\nJellinge, wood of the noblest dimensions was always available, whereas\r\nthe stone of the country was hard and intractable. In the Orkneys, on\r\nthe other hand, there is absolutely no timber of natural growth big\r\nenough to afford a good-sized walking-stick, and stone is not only\r\neverywhere abundant, but splits easily into slabs, self-faced, and most\r\neasily worked, so that stone, and stone only, would be the material\r\nemployed in the Orkneys for that purpose, as wood would also be the\r\nbest and most available material in Denmark.\r\n\r\nIf, before leaving this branch of the subject, we turn back for a few\r\nminutes to the Irish monuments, we are now in a position to judge more\r\ncorrectly of the probabilities of the case than we were. Assuming the\r\nthree-chambered tumulus at New Grange to have been erected between the\r\nyears 200 and 400, and Maes-Howe and Jellinge between 800 and 1000\r\nA.D., we have a period of from five to six, it may possibly be seven,\r\ncenturies between these monuments. Is this more than is sufficient to\r\naccount for the difference between them, or is it too little? It is\r\nnot easy to give a categorical answer to such a question, but judging\r\nfrom the experience gained from other styles, in different parts of the\r\nworld, the conclusion generally would be that the time is in excess\r\nof what is required. That there was progress, considerable progress\r\nindeed, made in the interval between the Irish and Scandinavian\r\nmonuments, cannot be denied, but that it should have required five\r\ncenturies to achieve this advance is hardly what would be expected, and\r\nit would be difficult to quote another example of a progress so slow.\r\nYet it is hardly possible to bring down New Grange to the age of St.\r\nPatrick (A.D. 436), and as difficult to carry back Maes-Howe\r\nbeyond Ragnar Lothbrok (794 at the extreme), and between these dates\r\nthere are only 358 years; but we must certainly add something at\r\neither one end or the other; and if we do this, we obtain an amount of\r\nprogress so slow that it would be almost unaccountable, but upon the\r\nassumption that they are the works of two different peoples. At the\r\ntime the sepulchre on the Boyne was erected, Ireland was energetically\r\nand rapidly progressive, and her arts were more flourishing than might\r\nhave been expected from her then state of civilization. When Maes-Howe\r\nwas erected, the native population was poor and perishing, and as the\r\nlordly Vikings would hardly condescend to act as masons themselves,\r\nthey did the best they could with the means at their disposal. Explain\r\nit, however, as we may, it seems impossible to allow a longer time\r\nbetween the mounds at Jellinge and Stennis and those on the Boyne than\r\nhas been accorded above; and as it seems equally difficult to bring\r\nthem nearer to one another, the probability seems to be in favour of\r\nthe dates already assigned to them.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, from this digression; besides those just mentioned,\r\nDenmark possesses a nearly complete series of royal tombs such as\r\nare not to be found in any other country of Europe. Even Worsaae\r\nacknowledges the existence of that of Frode Frodegode, who lived\r\nabout the Christian era, of Amlech, near Wexio--Shakespeare's Hamlet,\r\nof Humble, and Hjarne,[352] besides those of Hildetand, and Gorm\r\nand Thyra, already mentioned. If the Danes would only undertake a\r\nsystematic examination of these royal sepulchres, it might settle many\r\nof the disputed points of mediæval archæology. To explore tombs to\r\nwhich no tradition attaches may add to the treasures of their museums,\r\nbut can only by accident elucidate either the history of the country\r\nor the progress of its arts. If ten or twelve tombs with known names\r\nattached to them were opened, one of two things must happen: either\r\nthey will show a succession and a progress relative to the age of their\r\nreputed occupants, or no such sequence will be traceable. In the first\r\ncase the gain to history and archæology would be enormous, and it is\r\nan opportunity of settling disputed questions such as no other country\r\naffords. If, on the other hand, no such connection can be traced,\r\nthere is an end of much of the foundations on which the reasoning of\r\nthe previous pages is based, but in either case such an enquiry could\r\nnot fail to throw a flood of light on the subject which we were trying\r\nto elucidate. The fear is that all have been rifled. The Northmen\r\ncertainly spared none of the tombs in the countries they conquered, and\r\nour experience of Maes-Howe and Thyra's tomb would lead us to fear that\r\nafter their conversion to Christianity they were as little inclined to\r\nspare those of their own ancestors. All they however cared for were the\r\nobjects composed of precious metals; so enough may still be left for\r\nthe less avaricious wants of the antiquary.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOLMENS.\r\n\r\nSo far as is at present known, there are not any tumuli of importance\r\nor any battle-fields marked with great stones in the north of Germany;\r\nbut the dolmens there are both numerous and interesting, and belong\r\nto all the classes found in Scandinavia, and, so far as can be\r\nascertained, are nearly identical in form. Nothing, however, would\r\nsurprise me less than if it should turn out that both barrows and Bauta\r\nstones were common there, especially in the island of Rügen and along\r\nthe shores of the Baltic as far east as Livonia. The Germans have\r\nnot yet turned their attention to this class of their antiquities.\r\nThey have been too busy sublimating their national heroes into gods\r\nto think of stones that tell no tales. Whenever they do set to work\r\nupon them, they will, no doubt, do it with that thoroughness which\r\nis characteristic of all they attempt. But as the investigation will\r\nprobably have to pass through the solar myth stage of philosophy, it\r\nmay yet be a long time before their history reaches the regions of\r\npractical common sense.\r\n\r\nNo detailed maps having been published, it is extremely difficult\r\nto feel sure of the distribution of these monuments in any part of\r\nthe northern dolmen region; but the following, which is abstracted\r\nfrom Bonstetten's 'Essai sur les Dolmens,' may convey some general\r\ninformation on the subject, especially when combined with the map (p.\r\n275), which is taken, with very slight modifications, from that which\r\naccompanied his work.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bonstetten there are no dolmens in Poland, nor in Posen.\r\nThey first appear on the Pregel, near Königsberg; but are very rare in\r\nPrussia, only two others being known, one at Marienwerder, the other at\r\nKonitz. In Silesia there is one at Klein-Raden, near Oppeln; another\r\nis found in the district of Liegnitz, and they are very numerous in\r\nthe Uckermark, Altmark, in Anhalt, and Prussian Saxony, as well as in\r\nPomerania and the island of Rügen. They are still more numerous in\r\nMecklenburg, which is described as peculiarly rich in monuments of this\r\nclass. Hanover possesses numerous dolmens, except in the south-eastern\r\ndistricts, such as Göttingen, Oberharz, and Hildesheim. To make up for\r\nthis, however, in the northern districts, Lüneburg, Osnabrück, and\r\nStade, at least two hundred are found. The grand-duchy of Oldenburg\r\ncontains some of the largest dolmens in Germany; one of these, near\r\nWildesheim, is 23 feet long; another, near Engelmanns-Becke, is\r\nsurrounded by an enclosure of stones measuring 37 feet by 23, each\r\nstone being 10 feet in height, while the cap stone of a third is 20\r\nfeet by 10. In Brunswick there were several near Helmstädt, but they\r\nare now destroyed. In Saxony some rare examples are found as far south\r\nas the Erzgebirge, and two were recently destroyed in the environs of\r\nDresden. Keeping along the northern line, we find them in the three\r\nnorthern provinces of Holland, Gröningen, Ober-Yssel, and especially in\r\nDrenthe, where they exist in great numbers, but none to the southward\r\nof these provinces, and nowhere do they seem to touch the Rhine or its\r\nbordering lands; but a few are found in the grand-duchy of Luxembourg\r\nas in a sort of oasis, halfway between the southern or French dolmen\r\nregion and that of northern Germany.\r\n\r\nFrom the North German districts they extend through Holstein and\r\nSchleswig into Jutland and the Danish isles, but are most numerous on\r\nthe eastern or Baltic side of the Cimbrian peninsula, and they are also\r\nvery frequent in the south of Sweden and the adjacent islands. Dolmens\r\nproperly so called are not known in Norway, but, as above mentioned,\r\ncairns and monuments of that class, are not wanting there.\r\n\r\nThe value of this distribution will be more easily appreciated when we\r\nhave ascertained the limits of the French field, but meanwhile it may\r\nbe convenient to remark that, unless the dolmens can be traced very\r\nmuch further eastward, there is a tremendous gulf before we reach the\r\nnearest outlyers of the eastern dolmen field. There is a smaller, but\r\nvery distinct, gap in the country occupied by the Belgæ, between it\r\nand the French field, and another, but practically very much smaller\r\none, between it and the British isles. This is a gap because the\r\nintervening space is occupied by the sea; but as it is evident from\r\nthe distribution of all the northern dolmens in the proximity to the\r\nshores and in the islands that the people who erected them were a\r\nsea-faring people, and as we know that they possessed vessels capable\r\nof navigating these seas, it is practically no gap at all. We know\r\nhistorically how many Jutes, Angles, Frisians, and people of similar\r\norigin, under the generic name of Saxons, flocked to our shores in the\r\nearly centuries of the Christian era, and afterwards what an important\r\npart the Danes and Northmen played in our history, and what numbers\r\nof them landed and settled in Great Britain, either as colonists or\r\nconquerors, at different epochs, down to at least the eleventh century.\r\nIf, therefore, we admit the dolmens to be historic, or, in other words,\r\nthat the erection of megalithic monuments was practised during the\r\nfirst ten centuries after the Christian era, we have no difficulty\r\nin understanding where our examples came from, or to whom they are\r\ndue. If, on the other hand, we assume that they are prehistoric, we\r\nare entirely at sea regarding them or their connection with those on\r\nthe continent. The only continental people we know of who settled in\r\nBritain before the Roman times were the Belgæ, and they are the only\r\npeople between the Pillars of Hercules and the Gulf of Riga who, having\r\na sea-board, have also no dolmens or megalithic remains of any sort.\r\nAll the others have them more or less, but the Northern nations did\r\nnot, so far as we know, colonise this country before the Christian era.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs all the Northern antiquaries have made up their minds that these\r\ndolmens generally belong to the mythic period of the Stone age, and\r\nthat only a few of them extend down to the semi-historic age of bronze,\r\nit is in vain to expect that they would gather any traditions or record\r\nany names that might connect them with persons known in history. We\r\nare, therefore, wholly without assistance from history or tradition\r\nto guide us either in classifying them or in any attempt to ascertain\r\ntheir age, while the indications which enable us to connect them with\r\nour own, or with one another, are few and far between.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 106. Dolmen at Herrestrup.]\r\n\r\nAmong the few that give any sure indications of their age, one of the\r\nmost interesting is at Herrestrup, in Zeeland, which has recently\r\nbeen disinterred from the tumulus that once covered it.[353] On it\r\nare engraved some half-dozen representations of ships, such as the\r\nVikings were in the habit of drawing, and which are found in great\r\nquantities on the west coast of Göttenburg.[354] According to the best\r\nauthorities, these representations range from about A.D. 500\r\nto 900,[355] and some may perhaps be more modern. Those in this dolmen\r\ndo not appear to be either among the most ancient or the most modern,\r\nand if we fix on the eighth century as their date, we shall not be very\r\nfar wrong. That they are also coeval with the monument seems perfectly\r\ncertain. We cannot fancy any Viking engraving these on a deserted\r\ndolmen, say even 100 years old, and then covering it up with a tumulus,\r\nas this one was till recently. Had it never been covered up, any\r\nhypothesis might be proposed, but the mound settles that point. Besides\r\nthe ships, however, there are an almost equal number of small circles\r\nwith crosses in them, on the cap stone. Whether these are intended to\r\nrepresent chariot-wheels, or some other object, is not clear, but if\r\nwe turn back to woodcut No. 41, representing the side-stone of the\r\ndolmen at Aspatria, we find the identical object represented there,\r\nand in such a manner that, making allowance for the difference of\r\nstyle in the century that has elapsed between the execution of the two\r\nengravings, they must be assumed to be identical. No engravings--so\r\nfar as I know--have been published of the objects found in this Danish\r\ndolmen, but in the English one, as already mentioned, the objects found\r\nbelonged to the most modern Iron age; such things, in fact, as will\r\nperfectly agree with the date of the eighth century. Among them, as\r\nwill be recollected, was the snaffle-bit, so like, though certainly\r\nmore modern than, Stukeley's bit found in Silbury Hill. We have thus\r\nthree tumuli which from their engravings or their contents confirm\r\none another to a most satisfactory extent, and render the dates above\r\nassigned to them, to say the least of it, very probable. If the date\r\nthus obtained for the Aspatria monument is accepted, it is further\r\ninteresting as giving that of those mysterious concentric circles, with\r\na line passing through them from the centre, which have been found in\r\nsuch numbers on the rocks in the north of England and in Scotland.[356]\r\nThese are, so far as I know, the only examples of these circles which\r\nwere buried, and were consequently associated with other objects which\r\nassist in fixing their age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 107. Dolmen at Halskov. From a drawing by Madsen.]\r\n\r\nAs before hinted, many of the monuments engraved by Madsen[357] are so\r\nextremely like those in the field of Northern Moytura that it is almost\r\nimpossible to believe that they were erected by a different race of\r\npeople, or at any great distance of time. The one, for instance, at\r\nHalskov is so like the dolmen and circle represented in woodcut No.\r\n61 that the one might almost pass for the other, were it not that the\r\nphotograph is taken from the wrong side, to bring out the resemblance,\r\nas it is seen on the spot, while in others the resemblance is as great,\r\nor even greater. It is very unsatisfactory, however, picking these\r\npoints of similarity from books, some of the engravings in which are\r\nfrom imperfect drawings. In others, artistic effect has been more aimed\r\nat than truth, and some are taken from photographs, which, though\r\nthey give a truthful, generally give an unintelligent representation\r\nof the object. It is only by personal familiarity that all the facts\r\ncan be verified and pitfalls avoided. But it is always useful to turn\r\nattention to any forms that may seem novel, and explain peculiarities\r\nin others which but for such means of comparison would remain\r\nunnoticed. Here, for instance, is one from Sjöborg, which resembles\r\nthe Countless Stones at Aylesford, as drawn by Dr. Stukeley (woodcut\r\nNo. 27). It is found at a place called Oroust, in Böhuslan,[358] and\r\nstands on a low mound encircled by twenty large stones at its base. The\r\nchamber is low, and semicircular in form, and in front of it stands\r\nwhat the Germans call a sentinel stone. No date is given to this\r\nmonument by Sjöborg, for he was so far indoctrinated in modern theories\r\nthat he believed all dolmens to be prehistoric, though all the circles\r\nand Bauta stones marking battle-fields were to him as essentially\r\nhistoric as any monuments in his country. From its appearance, the\r\ndolmen at Oroust may be of the same age as the Countless Stones at\r\nAylesford, and if other monuments in the two countries could be\r\ncompared with anything like precision, their forms and traditions might\r\nmutually throw great light on their real histories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 108. Dolmen at Oroust. From Sjöborg.]\r\n\r\nIt is not only, however, from the analogies with similar monuments\r\nin this country, or from their bearing on their history, that the\r\nScandinavian dolmens are interesting to us. They have forms and\r\npeculiarities of their own which are well worth studying. If materials\r\nexisted for mastering these differences, their aggregate would make up\r\na sum which would enable us to separate the Scandinavian group from the\r\nBritish, as we can our own from the French, and the French from that\r\nof Northern Germany. A great deal more must, however, be published,\r\nand in a more accurate form, before this can be done; but, whenever\r\nit is possible, it promises to afford most satisfactory results to\r\nethnographical science. The problem is similar to that which was\r\nknown to exist in reference to pointed Gothic architecture. That is\r\nnow admitted to be a Celtic-French invention, but it was adopted by\r\nthe Spaniards and Italians on the one hand, and by the Germans and\r\nourselves on the other; although always with a difference. No antiquary\r\nwould now for an instant hesitate in discriminating between an Italian\r\nand a German or between a Spanish and an English example, though the\r\ndifference is so small that it can hardly be expressed in words, and\r\nmust be carefully represented in order to be perceived. In like manner,\r\nthe rude-stone style of art seems to have been invented by some\r\npre-Celtic people, but to have been adopted by Celts, by Scandinavian,\r\nby British, and Iberian races--perhaps not always pure in their own\r\ncountries, but always with considerable differences, which, when\r\nperceived and classified, will enable us to distinguish between the\r\nworks of the several races as clearly as we can between the mediæval\r\nstyles that superseded them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 109. Diagram from Sjöborg, pl. i. fig. A.]\r\n\r\nAmong these peculiarities, the most easily recognised are the square\r\nor oblong enclosures which surround tumuli, and, sometimes, one, at\r\nothers two, or even three free-standing dolmens. In order to make the\r\npoint clear, I have quoted a diagram from Sjöborg, though it is almost\r\nthe only instance in this work in which a woodcut does not represent a\r\nreally existing object. I have no doubt, however, that it is correct,\r\nas old Olaus Wormius represents one of two similar ones which in his\r\nday existed near Roeskilde. Both had enclosures 50 paces square,\r\nenclosing one tumulus with a circle of stones round its base, another\r\nhalfway up, and, the text says, an altar-dolmen on the top, though the\r\nwoodcut does not show it. The other, on the road to Birck, in Zeeland,\r\nenclosed three tumuli in juxtaposition, the one in the centre similar\r\nto that just described, and with a dolmen on its summit; two smaller\r\nmounds are represented in juxtaposition on either side, but with only\r\na circle of stones round their base.[359] Other varieties no doubt\r\nexist, but modern antiquaries have not favoured us with any drawings of\r\nthem. From the diagram and description it will be perceived that in so\r\nfar as the mound itself is concerned these Danish tumuli are identical\r\nwith those already quoted as existing in Auvergne (woodcut No. 8), but\r\nso far as I know, the square enclosure does not exist in France, nor\r\ndoes it in this country. These square enclosures seem, however, to\r\nbelong to a very modern date, and the stones, consequently, are small,\r\nand may therefore have been removed, which could easily be done; but\r\nstill there seems little doubt that many of them may still remain, and\r\ncould be found if looked for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 110. Dolmen near Lüneburg. From Bonstetten.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking examples I know of, an oblong rectangular\r\nenclosure, enclosing a single free-standing dolmen, is that near\r\nLüneburg, figured by Bonstetten[360] (woodcut No. 110); he seldom,\r\nhowever, indulges in dimensions, and being perfectly convinced that\r\nall are prehistoric, he never speculates as to dates, nor condescends\r\nto notice traditions. What we know of it is therefore confined to the\r\nrepresentation, which after all may be taken from some other work, as\r\nhe rarely favours us with references. Two others are represented by von\r\nEstorff as existing near Uelzen, in Hanover.[361]\r\n\r\nA good example of two dolmens in a rectangular enclosure is that at\r\nValdbygaards, near Soröe, in Zeeland. Here the enclosure is about 70\r\nfeet in one direction by 20 feet in the other--outside measurement. In\r\nthis instance, the enclosing stones are smaller in proportion to the\r\ndolmens than is usually the case. On the same plate, Madsen represents\r\na single dolmen in a much squarer enclosure.[362] It, like that at\r\nHalskov (woodcut No. 107), is represented as standing on a knoll, but\r\nwhether dolmens stand so or on the flat, like that at Valdbygaards, it\r\nis quite certain they never were enclosed in tumuli, but always stood\r\nfree, as they now do.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 111. Double Dolmen at Valdbygaards. From Madsen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 112. Plan of Double Dolmen at Valdbygaards.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 113. Triple Dolmen, Höbisch. From Keysler.]\r\n\r\nFor three dolmens in one square enclosure we are obliged to go back\r\nto old Keysler, though, in this case, the engraving is so good that\r\nthere can be very little doubt of its correctness.[363] It is situated\r\nnear Höbisch, in Mark Brandenburg, consists of an outer enclosure of\r\nforty-four stones, and is 118 paces in circuit, and in the middle\r\nare twelve stones, of which six bear three large stones, placed\r\ntransversely upon them. It is very much to be regretted that no better\r\nillustration of this curious monument exists, as it probably very\r\nclosely resembles those in Drenthe, with which, indeed, he compares it;\r\nand as these form one of the most remarkable groups of this class of\r\nmonuments on the continent, it would be most desirable to trace their\r\nconnection with others farther east.\r\n\r\nA similar monument to that at Höbisch is figured by Sjöborg (vol. i.\r\npl. 6), but without the enclosure; and a third, Oroust, in Böhuslan\r\n(pl. 3); but in this instance the three long stones are surrounded by\r\na circular enclosure with two sentinel stones outside; and there are\r\nseveral others which show similar peculiarities in a greater or less\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nThe buried dolmens in Scandinavia are, in some respects, even more\r\ninteresting than those which are, and were always intended to be,\r\nexposed, but our knowledge of them is necessarily more limited than of\r\nthe other class. Sjöborg deserts us almost entirely here, and Madsen\r\nillustrates only two, while the modern antiquaries have been more\r\nanxious to secure and classify their contents than to illustrate the\r\nchambers from which they were obtained. As a rule, they may be older\r\nthan the free-standing examples, but they do not look old, though,\r\nas metal has not generally been found in them, it is assumed they\r\nall belong to the Stone age. One example will suffice to display the\r\ngeneral features of the older group of this class of monuments. The\r\nnext two woodcuts present an internal view and plan of one near Uby,\r\nin the district of Holbak, in Zeeland. It was opened in 1845, and\r\nmeasured then 13 feet in height, and had a circumference of upwards\r\nof 300 feet. The chamber measures 13 feet by 8 feet, and is walled in\r\nby nine great stones, which have been split or hewn, so as to obtain\r\na flat surface towards the interior, and the interstices are filled\r\nin with smaller stones very neatly fitted. The entrance gallery is 20\r\nfeet in length, and is closed, or capable of being so, by two doors.\r\nFrom the disposition of the entrance it certainly does not appear that\r\nit was intended to be hid. The whole appearance is that of a dignified\r\napproach to the tomb. Had it been meant to be closed, the chamber\r\nwould, no doubt, have been in the centre of the tumulus, instead of\r\nbeing near one side, as it is. The other monument of the same class,\r\nillustrated by Madsen,[364] is near Smidstrup, in the district of\r\nFredericksborg. It is very similar in dimensions and details, but has\r\nthe peculiarity of having two chambers placed side by side, with two\r\nseparate entrances, and the chambers affect a curve more perfectly\r\nelliptical than is attained in that at Uby.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 114. View of Interior of Chamber at Uby. From Madsen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 115. Plan of Chamber at Uby. From Madsen.]\r\n\r\nThese last examples from Madsen's work are further interesting to us\r\nas illustrating the difference between dolmens or chambers always\r\nintended to be buried in tumuli and those which were always meant to be\r\nexposed. In the chambers at Uby and Smidstrup the stones are placed so\r\nclosely together that very little packing between them was sufficient\r\nto keep out the earth, and the passages to them and other arrangements\r\nall indicate their original destination. The case, however, is widely\r\ndifferent with the dolmens at Halskov and Valdbygaards, or those\r\nat Lüneburg or Höbisch, which evidently are now on their mounds as\r\noriginally designed. With a very little study it seems easy to detect\r\nthe original intentions in all these monuments; but there is this\r\nfurther difference. None of those intended to be exposed were ever\r\nburied, while many which were meant to have been covered up never\r\nreceived their intended envelope.\r\n\r\nA monument having a considerable affinity to the two last quoted\r\nexists, or perhaps rather existed, at Axevalla, in Westergothland.\r\nIt was opened apparently in 1805, and the representations are taken\r\nfrom drawings then made by a Captain Lindgren, who superintended the\r\nexcavation by the king's command. It consists of one apartment 21 feet\r\nlong by 8 feet wide and 9 feet high. The sides and roof are composed\r\nof slabs of red granite, which, if the plates are to be depended upon,\r\nwere hewn or at least shaped in some mechanical fashion. Instead of the\r\nbodies being laid on the floor of the chamber as was usually the case,\r\nand being found mixed up with _débris_ and utensils of various kinds,\r\neach of the nineteen who occupied this chamber had a little cist to\r\nitself, so small and irregular-shaped, like those at Rose Hill (woodcut\r\nNo. 39), that the body had to be doubled up, in a most uncomfortable\r\nposition, to be placed in the cist. This was by no means an uncommon\r\nmode of interment in those early ages, but if the skeletons were really\r\nfound in the attitudes here represented, their interment must date\r\nfrom very recent times indeed. I know there is nothing more common\r\nin archæological books than to represent skeletons sitting in most\r\nfree and easy attitudes in their boxes.[365] But if all the flesh had\r\ndisappeared as completely as these drawings represent, the integuments\r\nmust have gone also, and if they were either rotted or reduced to\r\ndust, the skeleton must have collapsed and been found in a heap on the\r\nfloor. It would be interesting to know how long, either in very dry\r\nor in moist places, the integuments would last so as to prevent this\r\ncollapse before they were disturbed. No qualified person has yet given\r\nan opinion on such a subject, but the time could hardly extend to many\r\ncenturies. But does the case really exist? are not all these queer\r\nskeletons merely the imaginings of enthusiastic antiquaries?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 116. Dolmen at Axevalla. From Sjöborg.]\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, these elliptical and long rectangular dolmens,\r\nwith their arrangement of cists and entrances in the centre of the\r\nlonger side, seem so distinguished from those generally found in other\r\ncountries as to mark another province. It seems scarcely open to doubt\r\nthat the oval forms are the older, though what their age may be is not\r\nso clear, nor have any descriptions of their contents been published\r\nwhich would enable us to form distinct opinion on the subject. Flint\r\nimplements have been found in them, but, so far as I can gather, no\r\nbronze. According to the Danish system, therefore, they are all before\r\nthe time of Solomon or the siege of Troy. It may be so, but I doubt\r\nit exceedingly. Those who excavated the Axevalla tomb reported that\r\nsomething like an inscription was found on one of the walls (woodcut\r\nNo. 116, fig. A); but whether it was an inscription or a natural\r\nformation is by no means clear--at all events, as we have no copy of\r\nit, it hardly helps us in arriving at a date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 117. Head-stone of Kivik Grave. From Sjöborg.]\r\n\r\nIn some respects, the Axevalla tomb resembles the grave near Kivik, in\r\nthe district of Cimbrisham, near the southern extremity of Sweden. This\r\nis the most celebrated of Swedish graves. It is mentioned as perfect by\r\nLinnæus in 1749, but was shortly afterwards opened, and drawings and\r\nillustrations of it have from time to time been published since, and\r\ngiven rise to the usual diversity of opinion. Suhm and Sjöborg seem to\r\nagree in connecting it with a battle fought in that neighbourhood by\r\nRagnar Lothbrok, about the year 750, in which the son of the then king\r\nwas slain.[366] This date appears probable; had it been later, there\r\nwould almost certainly have been found Runes on some of its stones; if\r\nearlier, the representations of the human figure would hardly have been\r\nso perfect. One stone found elsewhere (woodcut No. 117),[367] which\r\nseems to have been its head-stone, has a curious resemblance to the\r\nhead-stone of the Dol ar Marchant, at Locmariaker, illustrated farther\r\non. The likeness may be accidental, but, as in all these cases, it\r\nis difficult to believe that five or six centuries can have elapsed\r\nbetween two monuments which show so little progress; for whether this\r\nstone belonged to the Kivik grave or not, it certainly is of the same\r\nage and design, some of the figures on it being identical with those\r\nfound in the tomb, and that can hardly be older than the date above\r\nquoted. Another of the stones of this tomb has two of those circles\r\nenclosing crosses which are seen on the Herrestrup dolmen and the\r\nAspatria stone, all of which probably belong to the eighth century. The\r\ntomb itself is not remarkable for its dimensions, being only 14 feet\r\nlong by 3 feet wide, and almost 4 feet in height. It is much too large,\r\nhowever, for any single warrior's grave, but we are not told whether\r\nit was occupied by a number of small cists like that at Axevalla. The\r\nprobability, however, is that this was the case, but 120 years ago men\r\nwere not accurate observers of antiquarian phenomena.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are two other forms of tombs which, so far as is\r\nyet known, are quite peculiar to the Scandinavian province. The first\r\nof these are the so-called ship graves, from their form. They consist\r\nof two segments of a circle joined together at the ends, so as to\r\nrepresent the deck of a vessel, and are of all sizes, from 20 or 30\r\nfeet to 200 or 300 feet. They are generally found on the sea-shore, and\r\nit seems hardly to be doubted that they mark the graves of Vikings.\r\n\r\nThe other form is quite as peculiar, but more difficult to explain.\r\nIt is marked by a range of stones forming an equilateral triangle,\r\nsometimes straight-lined, but as frequently the lines curve inwards\r\nso as to restrict the internal space considerably. It is by no means\r\nclear what suggested this form, or what it was intended to represent.\r\nIt is, however, found on battle-fields (woodcut No. 118), and solitary\r\nexamples are frequent in Sjöborg's plates, sometimes with a Bauta\r\nstone in the centre. The one hypothesis that seems to account for this\r\nform, is that it is the \"Cuneatus ordo\" of Olaus Magnus, and that it\r\nmarked a spot where a combined phalanx of horse and foot fought and\r\nconquered.[368] The probability is that where single it marks the grave\r\nof a particular rank either in the army or in civil life.\r\n\r\nAll these forms are shown in the next woodcut, from a group found in\r\nthe peninsula of Hjortehammer, in Bleking, in the south of Sweden, but\r\nothers are found in the island at Amrom, and in many other places.[369]\r\nIt has been disputed whether these represent battle-fields or are the\r\nordinary graves of the inhabitants of the district in which they are\r\nfound. That those found on the shore at Freyrsö (woodcut No. 101) mark\r\nthe graves of those who fell in Blodoxe's battle there in the tenth\r\ncentury seems quite certain, but whether this was always the case\r\nmay be open to doubt; but certainly a sandy peninsula, like that of\r\nHjortehammer, seems a most unlikely place for peaceful men to bury\r\ntheir dead, especially at a time when not one-tenth part of the land\r\naround could have been under cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 118. Graves at Hjortehammer. From Worsaae.]\r\n\r\nFor our present purposes it is of no great consequence which opinion\r\nprevails, as these forms have no bearing on those of other countries,\r\nespecially as their date does not seem to be doubted. Worsaae places\r\nthem all between the years 700 and 1000,[370] or in the second and\r\nlatest Iron age, and as no one seems to dispute this, it may be\r\naccepted as an established fact. Their peculiarities of form, and the\r\nsmallness of the stones of which most of them are composed, are such\r\nthat the date here ascribed to them does not necessarily bring down\r\nthat of the true megalithic remains to anything like the same age. It\r\ntakes away, however, all improbability from the assertion that these\r\nmay be much more modern than was supposed, and this much is certain\r\nthat there was no break between the great English and Irish circles\r\nand the Viking graves; or, in other words, men did not cease to mark\r\ntheir sepulchres with circles and cairns, and then after a lapse of\r\ncenturies revive the custom, and begin it again on a smaller scale.\r\nThere may be a descent, but there was no solution of continuity, and\r\nany one can consequently form an idea how long a time must have elapsed\r\nbefore the great Wiltshire circles could have degenerated into those of\r\nHjortehammer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 119. Circles at Aschenrade. From Bähr.]\r\n\r\nThere is one other group of monuments it seems worth while to\r\nillustrate before leaving this branch of the subject. They are found\r\nin the extreme east of the province, on the banks of the Dwina, in\r\nLivonia. At a place called Aschenrade, about fifty miles as the crow\r\nflies from Riga, is a group shown in the accompanying woodcut.[371] The\r\narrangement is unusual in Europe, but is met with in Algeria, and seems\r\nto be only such a combination of the square enclosures of Scandinavia\r\nas we would expect to find in a cemetery, as contradistinguished from a\r\nbattle-field.\r\n\r\nIn these graves was found enormous wealth of bronze and other metal\r\nand personal ornaments, many of which are engraved in Professor\r\nBähr's book. They resemble in many respects the celebrated \"find\" at\r\nHallstadt, in the Salzkammergut;[372] but mixed with these Livonian\r\ntreasures were great numbers of coins and implements of iron of very\r\nmodern form. The coins are classified as follows:--\r\n\r\n  German coins, dating from                 A.D. 936 to 1040.\r\n\r\n  Anglo-Saxon coins, dating from        \"        991  \" 1036.\r\n\r\n  Byzantine coins, dating from          \"        911  \" 1025.\r\n\r\n  Arabic or Kufic coins, dating from    \"        906  \"  999.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that the Eastern coins should be so much earlier than the\r\nothers, but they are only five in number, and may have been preserved\r\nas curiosities. The dates of the others prove, at all events, that some\r\nof these tombs are not of earlier date than 1040, and all, probably,\r\nare included in the century which preceded that epoch.\r\n\r\nBesides these, however, there are tumuli at a place called Segewolde,\r\nand circles, sometimes with a stone in the centre, at Bajard, and no\r\ndoubt other remains of the same class in the district. The purpose,\r\nhowever, of the only book I know on the subject was not to illustrate\r\nthe forms of tombs, but that of the objects found in them, and to trace\r\nthe ethnographic relations of the people who possessed them with the\r\nother tribes who at various times inhabited that district. The dates of\r\nthe whole, according to their describer, may safely be included between\r\nthe eighth and the twelfth century.[373]\r\n\r\n\r\nDRENTHE.\r\n\r\nThe most southern group of these monuments belonging to the northern\r\ndivision is one of the most extensive, though unfortunately one of\r\nthe least known. It is situated almost exclusively in the province of\r\nDrenthe, in North Holland, where the Hunebeds--giants' beds or graves,\r\nas they are locally called--are spread over an area extending some\r\ntwenty miles north and south, and probably ten or twelve miles in\r\nthe opposite direction. This tract of country is a bare open heath,\r\nwhich even now is only partially cultivated, or indeed capable of\r\ncultivation, and at no time could have supported a population at all in\r\nproportion to so extensive a group of monuments.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1720, Keysler drew attention to them, and gave\r\na representation of one in order to show its similarity to\r\nStonehenge.[374] The engraving, however, is so defective that it is\r\nimpossible to make out what it represents, and as no dimensions or\r\nstatistics are given, it adds very little to our knowledge. A short\r\npaper on the subject appeared in the 'Journal of the Archæological\r\nAssociation' in 1870, but unfortunately without any illustrations,[375]\r\nand we are consequently dependent for our knowledge of them almost\r\nentirely to a work published at Utrecht in 1848, by the late Dr.\r\nJanssen, keeper of the antiquities in the museum at Leyden. This work\r\nis in many respects most painstaking and satisfactory; but, though it\r\nis hardly correct to say it, is without illustrations, the Hunebeds\r\nare represented by conventional symbols, which no one would guess\r\nwere intended for buildings of any sort without a most careful study\r\nof the book. I have ventured to try to translate one of these into\r\nordinary forms, in woodcut No. 120, but without at all guaranteeing\r\nits correctness. It is, however, sufficiently accurate to explain the\r\ngeneral nature of the monuments.\r\n\r\nWithin the area above described, Janssen measured and described\r\nfifty-one Hunebeds still existing, and they were probably at one time\r\nmuch more numerous, as he regrets the loss of four which he remembers\r\nin his youth; and several others have been very much ruined in very\r\nrecent times. This, fortunately, is not likely to happen again, as,\r\nwith a liberality and intelligence not shown by any other government in\r\nEurope, the Dutch have purchased the Hunebeds and the ground on which\r\nthey stand, with a right of way to the nearest road, so that, so far as\r\npossible, they will be protected from future depredations.\r\n\r\nOf these fifty-one monuments only one is a dolmen, in the sense in\r\nwhich we usually understand it, meaning thereby a single cap stone,\r\nsupported by three, or, as in this instance, by four uprights. This one\r\nis near Exlo, and is one of the few that formed a chamber in a tumulus.\r\nA few have three cap stones, and from that number they range up to\r\nten or twelve, with at least double that number of supports. They are\r\nall, in fact, of the class which the French call \"allées couvertes,\"\r\nor \"grottes des fées;\" Calliagh Birra's house (woodcut No. 80) and\r\nthe dolmens at Glen Columbkill are of the same class. But the Drenthe\r\ndolmens have one peculiarity not found either in France or Ireland:\r\nthat they are all closed at both ends, and the entrance, where there is\r\none, is always on the longer side. In this respect they more resemble\r\nthe Scandinavian examples, such as the tomb at Axevalla (woodcut No.\r\n116), or that at Uby (woodcut No. 114).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 120. Plan of Hunebed near Emmen.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed attempted restoration of one near Emmen will give a fair\r\nidea of their general arrangements. It is 49 feet long over all, and\r\ninternally from 4 to 6 feet in width. It is roofed with nine or ten\r\nstones, some of considerable dimensions. Some of these Hunebeds have\r\na range of stones round them, not arranged in a circle or oval form,\r\nbut, as in this instance, following the lines of the central chamber.\r\nThis is the case with another near the same place, which is 125 feet\r\nin length over all. When closely examined, however, it does not seem\r\nto be one Hunebed, but three ranging in a straight line, with a small\r\nspace between each. Two have five and one six cap stones. As a rule,\r\neach cap stone stands on two uprights, and though frequently they touch\r\none another, as often they form really independent trilithons. It was\r\nno doubt this fact that induced Keysler to compare these monuments with\r\nStonehenge, though in fact no two sets of rude-stone monuments could\r\nwell be more dissimilar either in arrangement or construction. As\r\nwill be seen from the annexed view of one near Ballo[376] (woodcut No.\r\n121), they are formed of unshaped granite boulders. Sometimes, it may\r\nbe, artificially split, but certainly untouched by the chisel. All that\r\nhas apparently been done has been to select those most appropriate in\r\nform for the purposes to which they were to be applied, and then rudely\r\nto heap them one upon the other, but in such a manner as to leave wide\r\ngaps everywhere between the stones composing the structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 121. Dolmen at Ballo. From a Photograph.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first question that arises with regard to these Hunebeds is, were\r\nthey originally covered with earth or not? That some of the smaller\r\nones were and are is clear enough, and some of medium size are still\r\npartially so; but the largest, and many of the smaller, do not show a\r\nvestige of any such covering; and it seems impossible to believe that\r\non a tract of wretched barren heath, where the fee-simple of the land\r\nis not now worth ten shillings an acre, any one could, at any time,\r\nhave taken the trouble to dig down and cart away such enormous mounds\r\nas would have been required to cover these monuments. It seems here\r\nclearer than almost anywhere else that, even if it had been intended\r\nto cover them, that intention, in more than half the cases, was never\r\ncarried into effect.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken for granted that these Hunebeds were at one time\r\nmuch more numerous in Drenthe than they now are, but it is a much\r\nmore difficult point to ascertain whether they extended into the\r\nneighbouring provinces or not. One is found in Gröningen, and one in\r\nFriesland, and none elsewhere. It may, of course, be that in these more\r\nfertile and thickly inhabited districts they have been utilised, or\r\nremoved as incumbrances from the soil, while in Drenthe their component\r\nparts were of no value, and they are useful as sheep-pens and pigstyes;\r\nand to these uses they seem to have been freely applied. It may be,\r\nalso, that there are no granite boulders in the neighbouring provinces,\r\nand that they are common in Drenthe. There certainly seem to be none\r\nin Guelderland, a country in which we would expect to find monuments\r\nof this class, as it is the natural line of connection with the German\r\ndolmen region; and unless it is that there were no materials handy for\r\ntheir construction, it is difficult to understand their absence.\r\n\r\nAs these Hunebeds have been open and exposed for centuries at least--if\r\nthey were not so originally--and have been used by the peasantry for\r\nevery kind of purpose, it is in vain to expect that anything will now\r\nbe found in them which can throw much light on their age or use. We\r\ncan only hope that an untouched or only partially plundered example\r\nmay be found in some of the numerous tumuli which still exist all\r\nover the country. I confess I do not feel sanguine that this will be\r\nthe case. I would hope more from the digging up of the floor of those\r\nwhich are known, and a careful collection of any fragments of pottery\r\nand other objects which may be found in them. Nothing of any intrinsic\r\nvalue will be found, of course; but what is perfectly worthless for\r\nany other purpose may be most important in an antiquarian sense.\r\nJudging them from a general abstract point of view, they do not seem\r\nof high antiquity, and may range from the Christian era down to the\r\ntime when the people of this country were converted to Christianity,\r\nwhenever that may have been. This, however, is only inferred from their\r\nsimilarity to other monuments mentioned in the preceding pages, not\r\nfrom any special evidence gathered from themselves or from any local\r\ntradition bearing on their antiquity.\r\n\r\nWhen we have examined the megalithic remains of Brittany and of the\r\nnorth of France, we shall be in a better position than we now are to\r\nappreciate the importance of the gap that exists between the French\r\nand Scandinavian provinces; but in the meanwhile it may be convenient\r\nto remark even here that it hardly seems doubtful that the Hunebeds\r\nof Drenthe and the Grottes des fées of Brittany are expressions of\r\nthe same feeling, and, generally, that the megalithic remains of the\r\nsouthern and northern divisions of the western parts of the European\r\ncontinent are the works of similar if not identical races, applied to\r\nthe same uses, and probably are of about the same age.\r\n\r\nThese two provinces are now separated by the Rhine valley. It is\r\nprobably not too broad an assertion to say there are no true Rude-Stone\r\nMonuments in the valleys of the Rhine or Scheldt,[377] or of any of\r\ntheir tributaries, or, in fact, in any of the countries inhabited by\r\nthe Germans and Belgæ. The dolmen-building races were, in fact, cut\r\nin two by the last-named race on their way to colonise Britain. When\r\nthat took place, we have no exact means of knowing. According to Cæsar,\r\nshortly before his time, Divitiacus ruled over the Belgæ of Gaul and\r\nBritain as one province;[378] and the inference from all we know--it\r\nis very little--is that the Belgian immigration to this island was of\r\nrecent date at that time. Whether it was one thousand or ten thousand\r\nyears, the fact that interests us here is that it took place before\r\nthe age of the rude-stone monuments. If we admit that the peoples who,\r\nfrom Cadiz to the Cimbric Chersonese, erected these dolmens were one\r\nrace--or, at least, had one religion--and were actuated by one set of\r\nmotives in their respect for the dead, it seems impossible to escape\r\nfrom the conclusion that, whether they came direct from the east,\r\nor migrated from the south northward, or in the opposite direction,\r\nthey at one time formed a continuous community of nations all along\r\nthe western shores of Europe. They were cut across only in one\r\nplace--between Drenthe and Normandy--and that by a comparatively modern\r\npeople, the Belgæ. If this is so, the separation took place in the\r\npre-dolmen period, whenever that may have been. If the original races\r\nin Belgium had been in the habit of erecting dolmens before they were\r\ndispossessed by the intruders, we should find remains at least of them\r\nthere now, as we do both north and south of that district. As the case\r\nnow stands, the conclusion seems inevitable that it was after their\r\nseparation that the northern and southern families, though no longer\r\nin contact, adopted, each in its own peculiar fashion, those more\r\npermanent and megalithic forms which contact with a higher civilization\r\ntaught them to aspire to, without abandoning the distinctions which\r\nseparated them from the more progressive Celts and the thoroughly\r\ncivilized Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe map opposite is compiled partly from the two by M. Bertrand,\r\nmentioned p. 326, and partly from one which accompanies Baron de\r\nBonstetten's 'Essai sur les Dolmens,' 1864.

Till, however, the\r\nGovernments of this country and of Denmark condescend to take up the\r\nsubject, such a map must necessarily remain imperfect in its most vital\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 321: 'Samlingar för Norders Fornälskare,' Stockholm,\r\n    1822-1830.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 322: 'Scriptures rerum Danicorum medii ævi,' 9 vols.\r\n    folio, Hafniæ, 1722 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 323: 'Historic Danicæ,' lib. xvi.

War and revolution, however, intervened just as the results of\r\nthese labours were about to be given to the world, and how long we may\r\nnow have to wait for them, no one can tell. The Musée de St.-Germain\r\nwas far from being complete in July last, and only the first parts of\r\nthe great 'Dictionnaire des Antiquités celtiques' had been published at\r\nthat time. We can now hardly hope that the necessary expenditure will\r\nbe continued which is indispensable to complete the former, and it is\r\ndifficult to foresee in what manner the materials collected for the\r\ndictionary can now be utilised.\r\n\r\nEven when much further advanced towards completion, it is hardly to\r\nbe expected that the museums of St.-Germain and Vannes can rival\r\nthe royal collections at Copenhagen; and if the French had confined\r\nthemselves only to collecting, they would not have advanced our\r\nknowledge very much; but, while doing this, they have also gathered\r\nstatistical information, and have been mapping and describing, so that\r\nour knowledge of their monuments is much more complete than of those\r\nof the Danes. To borrow a simile from kindred sciences, it is as if\r\nthe Danes had attended exclusively to the mineralogy of the subject:\r\ncollecting specimens from all parts, and arranging them according to\r\ntheir similarities or affinities, wholly irrespective of the localities\r\nfrom which they came. The French, on the other hand, have founded a\r\nscience similar to that of geology on their knowledge of the minerals;\r\nthey have carefully noted the distribution of the various classes\r\nof monuments, and, so far as possible, ascertained their relative\r\nsuperposition. The first is, no doubt, a most useful process, and one\r\nthat must to a certain extent precede the other; but unless we map the\r\nvarious rocks on the surface and ascertain their stratification, it\r\nhardly helps us in studying the formation or history of our globe.\r\n\r\nIn 1864 M. Bertrand published in the 'Revue archéologique' a small map\r\nof France, showing the distribution of dolmens as then known; and three\r\nyears afterwards another, on a much larger scale, intended to accompany\r\nthe 'Dictionnaire des Antiquités celtiques,' and containing all that\r\nwas then known. Were a second edition of this map published now, it\r\nwould, no doubt, be much more full and complete; but the main outlines\r\nmust still be the same, and are sufficient for our present purposes.\r\nFrom these maps and the text which accompanies them we learn that the\r\ngreater number of the rude-stone monuments in France are arranged at no\r\ngreat distance on either side of a straight line drawn from the shores\r\nof the Mediterranean, somewhere about Montpellier, to Morlaix, in\r\nBrittany. There are none east of the Rhone, none south of the Garonne,\r\ntill we come to the Pyrenees, and so few north of the basin or valley\r\nof the Seine that they may be considered as wanderers.\r\n\r\nReferring to the table at the end of this chapter, which is compiled\r\nfrom that of 1864, we find that thirty departments contain more than\r\nten monuments. Thirty others, according to M. Bertrand, contain from\r\none to eight or nine; and the remaining twenty-nine either contain none\r\nat all or these so insignificant as hardly to deserve attention.\r\n\r\nFrom this table we learn, at least approximately, several facts of\r\nconsiderable interest to our investigation. The first is that, of\r\nthe three divisions into which Cæsar divides Gaul, the northern in\r\nhis day belonged to a race who had had no stone monuments. There are\r\nnone in Belgium proper, and so few in French Flanders, or indeed in\r\nany part of Gallia Belgica, that we may safely assert that the Belgæ\r\nwere not dolmen-builders. In the next place, I cannot help agreeing\r\nwith M. Bertrand in his conclusion that the Celts properly so called\r\nhave as little claim to the monuments as the Belgæ.[379] We know\r\nsomething of the provinces occupied by the Celts six hundred years\r\nbefore Christ from Livy's[380] description of the tribes who, under\r\nBellevesus, invaded Italy. Their capital was Bruges, and they occupied\r\nthe departments immediately around that city; but they had not then\r\npenetrated into Brittany, nor north of the Seine, nor into any part of\r\nAquitania.[381] But they occupied the whole of the east of Gaul up,\r\napparently, to the Rhine and the country on the east bank of the Rhone.\r\nAccording to the French statistics, there are 140,000 barrows or tumuli\r\nin the departments of the Côte-d'Or, Vosges, Haut-Rhin, Bas-Rhin,\r\nDoubs, Jura, and Ain, but not one single dolmen;[382] and there are\r\nnone to the east of the Rhine. As we proceed westward, the tumuli\r\nbecome rarer, and the dolmens are gradually met with. The Averni, for\r\ninstance, were one of the Celtic tribes that accompanied Bellovesus,\r\nand in their country dolmens are found; but perhaps we need only infer\r\nfrom this that in a hilly country like Auvergne the older people still\r\nremained, and followed their old customs in spite of its partial\r\noccupation by the conquering Celts. We do not know at what period the\r\nCelts first invaded Gaul, but there seems no reason for supposing that\r\nit could not be very long before they first came in contact with the\r\nRomans; and if we may judge from the rate of progress which they made\r\nin subduing the rest of the country in historic times, their first\r\ninvasion could hardly have been a thousand years B.C. All the\r\ntumuli in the east of France which have been dug into have yielded\r\nimplements of bronze and metal,[383] and if they belonged to the Celts,\r\nthis would fairly accord with the conclusions at which archæologists\r\nhave arrived from other sources with regard to the Bronze age. It is\r\nnot, however, worth while following up the question here; for unless\r\nit could be proved that the dolmens either succeeded or preceded the\r\ntumuli, it has no bearing on our argument. The fact of their occupying\r\ndifferent and distinct districts prevents any conclusion of the sort\r\nbeing arrived at from geographical or external considerations. Their\r\ncontents, if compared, might afford some information, but up to the\r\npresent time this has not been done, and all we can at present assume\r\nis that there were two contemporary civilizations, or barbarisms,\r\nco-existing simultaneously on the soil of France. My impression is,\r\nhowever, that the Celtic barrow-builders were earlier converts to\r\nChristianity, and left off their heathenish mode of burial long before\r\nthe less easily converted dolmen-builders of the west ceased to erect\r\ntheir Rude-Stone Monuments.\r\n\r\nWe are thus reduced to the third of the great provinces into which Gaul\r\nwas divided in Cæsar's time, to try and find the people who could have\r\nerected the stone monuments of France, and at first sight it seems\r\nextremely probable that they were erected by the Aquitanians. Both\r\nCæsar[384] and Strabo[385] distinctly assert that the people of the\r\nsouthern province differed from the Celts in language and institutions\r\nas well as in features, and add that they resembled more the Iberians\r\nof Spain than their northern neighbours. When, however, we come to\r\nlook more closely into the matter, we find that the Aquitania of Cæsar\r\nwas confined to the country between the Garonne and the Pyrenees,\r\nand where, however, few, if any, dolmens now exist. They are rather\r\nfrequent in the Pyrenees[386] and the Asturias, where remnants of the\r\ndolmen-building races may have found shelter and continued to exist\r\nafter their congeners were swept from the plains; and there are one or\r\ntwo on the left bank of the Garonne, but except these there are none\r\nin Aquitania proper. If, however, we apply the term Aquitania to the\r\nprovince as extended by Augustus up to the left bank of the Loire, we\r\ninclude the greater part of the provinces where dolmens are found;\r\nbut here again, when we look more closely into it, we find that the\r\nnorthern districts of this great province were, in Augustus' time,\r\ninhabited by Celts, or, at all events, that Celts formed the governing\r\nand influential bodies in the states. Indeed, the fact seems to be\r\nthat, during the six centuries which elapsed between the invasions\r\nof Italy by the Gauls and the return invasion of Gaul by the Romans,\r\nthe Celts had gradually extended themselves over the whole of central\r\nFrance from the Garonne to the Seine, and had obliterated the political\r\nstatus of the people who had previously occupied the country, though\r\nthere is no reason to suppose they had then at least attempted to\r\nexterminate them. It must thus be either that the Celts were the\r\nbuilders of the dolmens, which appears most improbable, or that there\r\nexisted in these provinces a prehistoric people to whom they must be\r\nascribed.\r\n\r\nWithout at all wishing, at present at least, to insist upon it, I may\r\nhere state that the impression on my mind is every day growing stronger\r\nthat the dolmen-builders in France are the lineal descendants of the\r\nCave men whose remains have recently been detected in such quantities\r\non the banks of the Dordogne and other rivers in the south of\r\nFrance.[387] These remains are found in quantities in the Ardèche[388]\r\nand in Poitou.[389] If they have not been found in Brittany, it may be\r\nthat they have not been looked for, or that the soil is unfavourable\r\nto their preservation; but they have been found in Picardy, though\r\npossibly not exactly of the same class. It is, of course, dangerous to\r\nfound any argument on such local coincidence, as new discoveries may be\r\nmade in the east of France or elsewhere; but in the present state of\r\nour knowledge the Cave men and the dolmens seem not only conterminous\r\nbut their frequency seems generally to be coincident.\r\n\r\nAs we know next to nothing of the languages spoken in the south-west\r\nof France before the introduction of the Romance forms of speech,\r\nphilology will hardly assist us in our enquiry. There is, however, one\r\nparticle, _ac_, which I cannot help thinking may prove of importance,\r\nwhen its origin is ascertained. In the table at the end of this\r\nchapter, I have placed the number of the names of the cities having\r\nthis termination in each department[390] next to M. Bertrand's number\r\nof dolmens. The coincidence is certainly remarkable, more especially as\r\nit is easy to account for the comparative paucity of names with this\r\ntermination in Brittany by taking into account the enormous reflex wave\r\nof Celtic population from England that overwhelmed that country in the\r\nfourth and fifth centuries, and changed the nomenclature of half the\r\nplaces in the district: still, Carnac and Tumiac, Missilac, and others,\r\nas names of monuments, and Yffignac, as the name attached to the port\r\nwhich I believe was the place of embarkation for England, with many\r\nothers that remain, are sufficient to attest that more previously may\r\nhave existed.\r\n\r\nThe question remains, what is this particle? The first impulse is\r\nto assume that it is the Basque definite article. The Basques, for\r\ninstance, say _Guizon_, \"a man,\" _Guizónac_, \"the man,\" and _Guizónac_,\r\n\"the men,\" besides using it in other cases, while their local\r\nproximity to the dolmen country would render such a connection far\r\nfrom improbable. Against this, however, it may be urged, that _ac_,\r\nas a terminal syllable, hardly ever occurs in the Basque provinces,\r\nand the names to which it is attached in France hardly seem to belong\r\nto that language. Another suggestion has been made,[391] that it is\r\nequivalent to the Greek word πὁλις, which would be exactly\r\nthe signification for which we are looking, though in what language\r\nthis occurs is by no means clear. For our present purpose, however, it\r\nis of little consequence what it may or may not be. It is sufficient\r\nto know that its occurrence is, as nearly as may be, coincident with\r\nthe existence of dolmens. It does not occur to the eastward of the\r\nRhone, nor do dolmens, though both are frequent on the right bank of\r\nthat river; and it is not to be found in the east of France, in those\r\ncountries which we have reason to believe were at the dawn of history\r\nessentially Celtic, and where the tumuli of the Bronze period exist in\r\nsuch numbers. It does, however, occur in that part of Cornwall south of\r\nRedruth and west of Falmouth,[392] where all the rude-stone monuments\r\nof that province are found, but it is not found anywhere else in Great\r\nBritain or Ireland.\r\n\r\nNor is it found in the Channel Islands, though dolmens abound there;\r\nbut this may be accounted for by the subsequent colonisation of\r\nthese islands, as of Brittany in more modern times, by races of a\r\ndifferent origin, who have to a great extent obliterated the original\r\nnomenclature of the country.\r\n\r\nEqually interesting, however, for our purposes is the fact that, though\r\nthe _ac_-termination occurs frequently in the departments between the\r\nGaronne and the Pyrenees, no dolmens exist in that region except, as\r\nbefore mentioned, a few at the roots of the mountains. This, at first\r\nsight, might seem to militate against the universality of the theory;\r\nbut I, on the other hand, only take it to express that the _ac_-people\r\nwere driven from that country by Ibero-Aquitanians before they had\r\nadopted the fashion of stone monuments. If we knew when Aquitania was\r\nfirst occupied by the people whom Cæsar and Strabo found there, it\r\nwould give us a date before which dolmens could hardly have existed;\r\nbut as we have no materials for the purpose, all that can be said is\r\nthat, just as the dolmen races were cut in two by the Belgæ before the\r\nuse of stone for funereal monuments had been introduced, so here the\r\nsame phenomenon occurred, and the people we have to deal with were\r\ndriven north of the Garonne, west of the Rhone, and south of the Seine,\r\nbefore they took to building dolmens--assuming, of course, that they\r\nonce had extended beyond those limits; but this, except in the case of\r\nAquitania proper, does not at present seem capable of being proved.\r\n\r\nBefore the Romans came in contact with them, and our first written\r\naccounts describe them, they had ceased to be a nation politically, and\r\ntheir language also was lost, or, at least, except in the one syllable\r\n_ac_, we now know nothing of it. If, therefore, it may be argued, the\r\nnationality of this people was lost before the Christian era, and their\r\nlanguage had become extinct, these monuments must belong to a long\r\nanterior period. There are, however, certain considerations which would\r\nmake us pause before jumping too hastily to this conclusion. There are,\r\nthroughout the whole dolmen region of the south of France, a series\r\nof churches whose style is quite distinct from that of central and\r\nnorthern France. The typical example of this style is the well-known\r\nchurch of St.-Front, Périgueux. But the churches at Cahors, at\r\nSouillac, at Moissac, Peaussac, Tremolac, St.-Avit-Sénieur, and many\r\nothers, are equally characteristic. The cathedral at Angoulême, the\r\nabbey church at Fontevrault, and St.-Maurice at Angers,[393] and the\r\nchurch at Loches--all these churches are characterized by possessing\r\ndomes, and the earlier ones by having pointed arches which look very\r\nmuch more as if they were derived from the horizontal arches of the\r\ntumuli than from the radiating arches of the Romans, which the Celts\r\neverywhere adopted; and, altogether, the style is so peculiar that no\r\none the least familiar with it can ever mistake it for a Celtic style.\r\nAll belong to the same group, and as distinctly as, or even more so\r\nthan, the _ac_-termination, mark out the country as inhabited in the\r\neleventh and twelfth centuries by a people differing from the Celts.\r\nThough, therefore, both their nationality and their language may have\r\nbeen superseded by those of the more enterprising and active Celts\r\nbefore the time of Cæsar, it is evident they retained their old feeling\r\nand a separate internal existence to a period at least a thousand years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThere is still another trait that marks this country as a non-Celtic\r\ncountry in historical times--it is in the south-west, and there only,\r\nin France that Protestantism ever flourished or took root. To the Celt,\r\nthe transition was everywhere easy from the government of the hierarchy\r\nof the Druids to that of the similarly organized priesthood of Rome.\r\nBut it required all the cruel power of the Inquisition--the crusades of\r\nSimon de Montfort--the exterminating wars against the Camisards of the\r\nCevennes---and, in fact, centuries of the most cruel and unrelenting\r\npersecution down to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and, indeed,\r\nto the French Revolution--to exterminate this people and extirpate the\r\nfaith and feelings to which they clung. If they have in their veins,\r\nas I fancy they must have, any of the blood of the Cave people, they\r\nbelong to one of the least progressive people of the earth, and we\r\nshould not therefore be surprised if it required two thousand years\r\nof Celtic aggressiveness, coupled with Celtic ferocity, entirely to\r\nobliterate this race, if, indeed, that is done even now, which I very\r\nmuch doubt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this part of the subject, there is one other question\r\nwhich it may be as well to allude to here, as these investigations into\r\nthe distribution of the rude-stone monuments seem destined to throw a\r\nnew and important light upon it. Few questions have been more keenly\r\ndebated among the learned than the relationship stated to have existed\r\nbetween the Cimbri and the Gauls. A great deal has been, and can be,\r\nsaid on both sides,[394] but the difficulty appears to me to have\r\narisen principally from the erroneous assumption that on other people\r\nexcept the Celts existed in France.\r\n\r\nThere is no trace of Celts or of a Celtic language in the Cimbric\r\nChersonese or the north-west corner of Europe, which is generally\r\nassumed to be the country occupied by the Cimbri, and no such people as\r\nthe Cimbri are found settled in any part of France in historical times.\r\nIf, however, we assume that the relationship may have been between\r\nthe Cimbri and the Aquitanians, the case assumes a totally different\r\naspect. As we do not know what the language of the Aquitanians really\r\nwas, no assistance can be obtained from it, but our very ignorance of\r\nit leaves the field open for any other evidence that may be adduced,\r\nand that of the monuments seems clear and distinct. It seems almost\r\nimpossible that there should be so much similarity between the\r\nmonuments of the two countries without some community of race, and\r\nthe great likeness that exists between those on the southern frontier\r\nof the northern dolmen province and those on the northern edge of the\r\nsouthern dolmen field seems almost to settle the question.\r\n\r\nFrom history we only know of the existence of this relationship by the\r\nmode in which they fought together against Marius in the late Roman\r\nwars. If they were then geographically separated by the Belgæ and the\r\nCelts having thrust themselves between them, the separation must\r\nhave been recent, for a barbarian people could hardly be brought to\r\nacknowledge the ties and duties of relationship after a long interval\r\nof time.[395]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs may be gathered from the table, page 376, or the map opposite\r\npage 324, the rude-stone monuments are pretty evenly distributed\r\nover the whole of the area extending from the English Channel to the\r\nMediterranean Sea. Our knowledge of them is, however, practically\r\nconfined to the northern portion of this zone, known as Brittany. The\r\ninformation which is available regarding those of Languedoc and Guienne\r\nis of the most meagre description. Hundreds of English tourists have\r\nvisited Brittany, and many of them have drawn the monuments there and\r\nat least described them intelligibly; but I do not know one English\r\nbook that mentions those in the departments of Lot or Dordogne, and\r\nalmost the only information regarding them is to be picked up from the\r\nlocal \"Statistiques;\" but as these are very rarely illustrated, they do\r\nnot suffice. No form of words will convey a correct idea of any unknown\r\narchitectural monument except by comparing it with one that is known;\r\nand unless both have some well-defined features of style, it is even\r\nthen very difficult, and with rude unshaped stones, almost impossible,\r\nby words to convey what is intended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 122. Dolmen at Sauclières.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that we do not know more of the southern\r\nexamples,[396] as they are different in several essential features\r\nfrom those of the north; and it is probable that any one who was\r\nfamiliar with all could point out a gradation of style which would\r\naid materially in determining their age. Whatever that may turn out\r\neventually to be, no one will, I presume, contend that all are of one\r\nage or even of one century. It is far more probable that they extend\r\nover a considerable lapse of time, probably a thousand years, and\r\nif this is so, there must have been changes of fashion even among\r\nCave races as their blood got more and more mixed; and it would be\r\ninteresting to know where and--relatively at least--when this took\r\nplace. My present impression is that the southern are the most modern,\r\nfor this among other reasons.--I look on the sequence of a cist in a\r\nbarrow to a dolmen or chamber in a tumulus as very nearly certain,\r\nand from that the sequence to the exposed free-standing dolmen, and\r\nfrom that to the dolmen on the tumulus, as nearly, if not quite as,\r\nprobable. The latter form, so far as I know, never occurs in Brittany,\r\nwhile on the other hand it is common in the south of France.[397]\r\nIf they are of the same age as similar monuments in Scandinavia and\r\nIreland, they must be of comparatively modern date. There are also some\r\nmonuments, trilithons of hewn or partially hewn stone, as this one\r\nat Sauclières (woodcut No. 122), which at least look more modern than\r\ntheir northern congeners.\r\n\r\nThe monument, however, that seems capable of throwing the greatest\r\namount of light on their age is the dolmen of St.-Germain-sur-Vienne,\r\nnear Confolens, in Poitou. As will be seen from the woodcuts opposite,\r\nits cap-stone, measures 12 feet by 15 feet, and is of proportionate\r\nthickness. The mass was originally supported by five columns of\r\nGothic design, but one having fallen away, it now rests only on\r\nfour; but their interest arises from the fact that the style of\r\ntheir ornamentation belongs undoubtedly to the twelfth century or\r\nthereabouts--certainly not earlier than the eleventh. In order to\r\nexplain away so unwelcome an anomaly, it has been suggested, that some\r\npersons in the twelfth century cut away all the rest of the original\r\nrude stones which supported the cap-stone, and left only the frail\r\nshafts which we now see. If this were so, it would in no way alter the\r\nargument to be derived from it. If men could be found in the twelfth\r\ncentury to take the trouble and run the enormous risk of such an\r\noperation, their respect for the monument must have been quite equal\r\nto that implied in its erection; but the fact is that each of the five\r\ncolumns is composed of three separate pieces--a base, a shaft, and a\r\ncapital,[398] and we see them now as they were originally erected.[399]\r\n\r\nThere may be doubts about the tomb of the Moals at Ballina (page 233),\r\nbut doubt seems impossible with regard to this: it is a dolmen pure and\r\nsimple, and it was erected in the twelfth century. In itself the fact\r\nmay not be of any very great importance, but it cuts away the ground\r\nfrom any _à priori_ argument as to the age of these monuments. It does\r\nnot, of course, prove that they are all modern, but it does show that\r\nsome of them at least were erected after the time of the Romans, and\r\nat an era extending even far into the middle ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 123. Dolmen at Confolens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 124. Plan of Dolmen at Confolens.]\r\n\r\nIt is amusing, however, to see how the French antiquaries resist\r\nsuch a conclusion. Dr. de Closmadeuc, for instance, one of the most\r\ndistinguished antiquaries of Brittany, opened a perfectly virgin\r\ntumulus at Crubelz. After penetrating through three distinct but\r\nundisturbed strata, he reached the roof of the enclosed dolmen\r\nor chamber. In this he found the usual products of cremation and\r\nthe inevitable flint arrow-heads, but he refers in triumph to the\r\n\"absence de toute trace des métaux.\" \"Aucun doute,\" he adds, \"n'est\r\ndonc possible. Ce dolmen appartient bien à cette classe de monuments\r\nprimitifs de l'âge de pierre.\" So far all is clear; but there are\r\nstill difficulties, for he goes on to say: \"Nous tenons peu de compte\r\ndes débris de tuiles antiques rencontrées à la superficie du tumulus,\r\net même sous les tables du dolmen. Il est raisonnable d'admettre que\r\nces fragments de tuiles qui dénoncent l'industrie gallo-romaine, ont\r\naccidentellement pénétré dans l'intérieur.\"[400]\r\n\r\nLet us pause a moment to consider what is involved in such a\r\nsupposition. These tiles, which it is admitted are scattered in\r\nquantities over the surrounding plain, must have climbed to the top\r\nof the mound, penetrated through three undisturbed strata of earth,\r\nand finally penetrated \"accidentally\" between the close-fitting slabs\r\nforming the roof of the chamber. The hypothesis will not bear a\r\nmoment's examination, but anything, however absurd, is to some minds\r\npreferable to admitting that any dolmen or tumulus can be subsequent to\r\nRoman times. It is astonishing, however, what effect that shibboleth,\r\n\"no trace of metal,\" has on the mind of most antiquaries. It is, of\r\ncourse, true that before the metals were introduced no trace of them\r\ncould be found in the prehistoric barrows of the rude savages that\r\noccupied Europe in the earliest times. We do not, at the present day,\r\nbury metal objects in our graves, and but for the coffin nails it would\r\nbe as fair to argue that the graves in Kensal Green are prehistoric\r\nbecause the interments show no trace of metal implements. At all\r\nevents, there are many burying races now existing who do not use\r\ncoffins, nor bury metal objects in their graves; and all these this\r\nargument would make prehistoric. To me it seems much more logical to\r\nassume that, in those countries which had been occupied by the Romans,\r\nthe natives, though reverting after their departure to their original\r\nmodes of sepulture, had at least been so far civilized as to know that\r\nbronze daggers and spear-heads were not likely to be of much use in the\r\nnext world, and had come to the conclusion that the personal ornaments\r\nof the dead might as well remain with their living friends. This\r\nhypothesis would at least account for the absence of metal in the long\r\nbarrows of Gloucestershire, and at West Kennet, as well as at Crubelz,\r\nthough Roman pottery was found in all these instances. In fact, it is\r\nthe merest negative presumption to assume that, because no metal is\r\nfound in a grave, it must be prehistoric. It may be of any age, down to\r\nyesterday's, in so far as such proof is concerned.\r\n\r\nEven the presence of metal, however, does not disturb the faith of\r\nsome antiquaries. The Baron de Bonstetten, for instance, opened a\r\ntumulus not far from Crubelz. At one foot (30 centimetres) below the\r\nundisturbed surface the usual deposit of flint implements was found;\r\nand two feet (60 centimetres) below them two statuettes of Latona in\r\nterra-cotta and a coin of Constantine II. were found, but without this\r\nin the least degree shaking his undoubting faith in the prehistoric\r\nantiquity of the tomb![401]\r\n\r\nNumerous other Roman coins have been found in these French monuments,\r\nbut their testimony is disregarded. In the Manné er H'roëk, commonly\r\ncalled the Butte de César, about half a mile south from Locmariaker,\r\nnear the surface, eleven medals of the Roman emperors, from Tiberius\r\nto Trajan, were found, together with fragments of bronze, glass, and\r\npottery, but there were no signs of a secondary interment.[402] In like\r\nmanner, in another monument at Beaumont-sur-Oise, Roman moneys were\r\nfound, but, as M. Bertrand is careful to explain, in a stratum above\r\nthe stone and flint implements, which, of course, he believed to mark\r\nthe true date of the monument.[403] It seems impossible, however, that\r\nall these Roman coins can have been accidentally placed there. Those of\r\nValentinian and Theodosius in the mound at New Grange were precisely in\r\nthe same position as those of Titus, Domitian, and Trajan in the Butte\r\nde César or those of Beaumont, and so were those of Constantine found\r\nat Uley, in Gloucestershire (_ante_, p. 165). Those of Valentinian at\r\nMinning Lowe were in the tomb itself; so probably might others have\r\nbeen found in the other tombs had they not previously been rifled. It\r\nis not easy to assign a motive for placing these coins in the upper\r\npart of the mound externally. Their being found in that position at\r\nNew Grange, Uley, Locmariaker, and Beaumont, is, however, sufficient\r\nto prove it was not accidental, and their value is so small that they\r\ncould not have been buried there for concealment. They must have had\r\nsomething to do with some funereal rite or superstition, the memory of\r\nwhich has passed away. No ancient British or Gaulish coins have ever\r\nbeen found in similar positions, and no Christian coins, which, had\r\ntheir presence been purely accidental, would probably have been the\r\ncase. The inference seems to me inevitable that they were looked on as\r\nvalued relics or curiosities, and placed there intentionally by those\r\nwho raised the mounds it may be very long after the dates which the\r\ncoins bear.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOLMENS.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing specific in the Rude Stone Monuments of France\r\nsufficient to distinguish them from those of the other countries\r\nwe have been describing. They are larger, finer, and more numerous\r\nthere than in either Scandinavia or the British Isles, but except\r\nin the negative peculiarity of there being no circles in France\r\nthere is little to distinguish the two groups. It can hardly even be\r\nabsolutely asserted that there are no circles in France. There are\r\nsome semicircles, which may possibly have been parts of circles never\r\ncompleted; there are some rows of small stones around or on tumuli; but\r\ncertainly nothing that can for one moment be classed with the great\r\ncircles of Cumberland and Wiltshire, or those of Moytura and Stennis,\r\nand certainly nothing like the innumerable Scandinavian examples.\r\n\r\nWe are hardly yet in a position to speculate why this should be so;\r\nbut, so far as I can at present see, I would infer from this that the\r\nFrench examples are, as a rule, of earlier date than the British and\r\nScandinavian. The circle I take to be one of the latest forms of rude\r\nstone architecture--the skeleton of a tumulus, after the flesh of the\r\nsepulchral mound, which gave meaning to the group, had been thrown on\r\none side as no longer indispensable. But of this we shall be better\r\nable to judge as we proceed.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic, although not a distinction, is the fondness of\r\nthe French for the \"Allée couverte\" or \"Grotte des fées.\" No examples\r\nof this form have yet been brought to light in England, but one is\r\nengraved (woodcut No. 80) as the Hag Birra's grave near Monasterboice,\r\na second from the same neighbourhood, at Greenmount (woodcut No.\r\n81), and they exist in Scandinavia, but their home is Drenthe and\r\nthe neighbouring corner of Germany. As already mentioned, upwards of\r\nfifty examples exist in that province. They are much ruder, it must be\r\nconfessed, than those of France; but this may arise from the nature of\r\nthe only material available; they have also the peculiarity of having\r\nthe entrance always at the side instead of at the end.\r\n\r\nSo far as their distribution in France has yet been ascertained, the\r\nGrottes des fées exist only on the Loire, and to the north of it, in\r\nfact in the most northern division of the French dolmen region; while,\r\non the other hand, as they are principally found in Drenthe, or at the\r\nsouthern extremity of the German dolmen field, we may assume that there\r\nis some connection between the two, or that there would have been if it\r\nhad not been severed by the Belgians before those in either region were\r\nerected.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest of the French examples of this class of monuments\r\nis that near Saumur, at Bagneux. The walls are composed of only four\r\nstones on one side and three on the other, yet it measures 57 feet 6\r\ninches by 14 feet 4 inches across. Another, near Essé, is even larger,\r\nthough not so regular in plan, nor so grand in the character of the\r\nstones. It measures, however, 61 feet by 12 feet at the entrance,\r\nincreasing to 14 feet over all at the inner end. There is a third at\r\nMettray, near Tours, which, though very much smaller, is curiously\r\ncharacteristic of the form. The immense mass in the centre (woodcut\r\nNo. 125) and the two smaller which form the roof almost take from it\r\nthe character of rude-stone architecture. There is a fourth, of a\r\nless megalithic character, at Locmariaker,[404] and several others\r\nare dispersed over Brittany. It is not possible to know whether the\r\nintention may not have been that these, like all smaller chambers,\r\nshould have been buried in tumuli. These just quoted, however,\r\ncertainly never were so, but this may have arisen from their having\r\nbeen left unfinished. That at Bagneux, however, could hardly have\r\nsupported a heavy mass without falling in, and that at Mettray looks\r\ntoo like a finished monument for any one to fancy its builders wished\r\nit hid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 125. Dolmen near Mettray. From Gailhabaud.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 126. Dolmen of Krukenho.]\r\n\r\nThe more usual form of French dolmens is either square or slightly in\r\nexcess of that form, seldom reaching two squares in plan, and with a\r\nheight equal to its breadth. One of the finest specimens[405] of a\r\nmonument of this class is in the middle of the village of Krukenho,\r\nhalfway between Carnac and Erdeven, and is now used as a cart-shed\r\nor barn. It certainly never was covered up, though its entrance may\r\nhave been closed; indeed, the stones used for that purpose still lie\r\nin front of it. From this, which may be styled a first-class dolmen\r\nof the ordinary type, down to the simple dolmen of four stones, like\r\nKit's Cotty house, every possible variety and gradation are to be found\r\nin France; but, so far as I know, no classification has been hit upon\r\nwhich would enable us to say which are the oldest or which the more\r\nmodern.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, I am inclined to look on the Grottes des fées\r\nas the more modern form. The stones of which they are composed are\r\ngenerally hewn, or at least shaped, by metal tools to the extent to\r\nwhich those of Stonehenge can be said to be so treated. They also look\r\nmore like ordinary structures than other megalithic monuments, and seem\r\nrather sepulchral chapels than sepulchres. Even, however, if we were to\r\ndetermine to regard them as relatively the most modern of the northern\r\ndolmens, this would not settle the question of the southern external\r\ndolmens on tumuli, which may be even more modern. These questions,\r\nhowever, must, I fear, remain unanswered till our knowledge of the form\r\nof the whole group and of the materials of which the monuments are\r\ncomposed is more extensive and more accurate than it is at present.\r\n\r\nThe holed-stone variety occurs frequently in France, either in the form\r\nof simple four-stone dolmens, like that of Trie, Oise[406] (woodcut\r\nNo. 127), or in a still more characteristic example at Grandmont, in\r\nBas-Languedoc[407] (woodcut No. 128). Certainly neither of these was\r\nintended to be covered up, at least in the first instance, or, at all\r\nevents, only partially; or the use of the hole, which was, no doubt,\r\nto get access to the chamber, would have been destroyed. The umbrella\r\nform of the southern example is hardly such as would ever be used for a\r\nchamber in a tumulus, but as a pent-roof is singularly suitable for an\r\nopen-air monument. The so-called Coves at Avebury were, I believe, in\r\nthis form, and it prevails also in India[408] and elsewhere, and the\r\nlikeness between the two is so remarkable that it may well have given\r\nrise to speculations as to their common origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 127. Holed Dolmen, at Trie. From Gailhabaud.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 128. Dolmen of Grandmont.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 129. Demi-dolmen. From Malé, 'Antiquités du Morbihan.']\r\n\r\nThere is still a form of dolmen very common in France, but found\r\nalso frequently in these islands, though I do not know if it occurs\r\nin Scandinavia. Mr. Du Noyer proposed to call them \"earth-fast\r\ndolmens,\"[409] from one end of the cap-stones always resting on the\r\nground, the other only being supported by a pillar or block. At first\r\nsight it might appear that they were only unfinished or imperfect\r\ndolmens, as it is more than probable that the mode of erection, in all\r\ninstances, was to raise first one end of the cap-stone and then the\r\nother, as by this means the weight is practically halved. If, however,\r\nany faith is to be placed in this representation of a monument by\r\nMalé,[410] it is clear that it was a deliberate mode of getting rid of\r\nhalf the expense and half the trouble of erecting a dolmen sepulchre.\r\nGenerally speaking, however, they are more like the one near Poitiers\r\n(woodcut No. 130), where the stone either rests at one end on a bank or\r\non a flat space sloping upwards. Those in Ireland and Wales seem all\r\nreally to be only demi-dolmens, and as economy would hardly be a motive\r\nin the good old times, I look upon them as probably a very modern\r\nform of this class of monument. There is, indeed, one at Kerland, in\r\nBrittany (woodcut No. 131), which, in spite of the shock such an idea\r\nwill give to most people, I cannot help thinking is and always was a\r\nChristian monument. At least it is inconceivable to me from what motive\r\nany Christian could have erected a cross on a pagan monument of this\r\nclass, if it really were one. It seems, on the other hand, perfectly\r\nintelligible that long after their nominal conversion to Christianity\r\nthe people would adhere to the forms so long practised by their\r\nancestors, and there appears to be no great reason why even the most\r\nbigoted priest should object to it, provided the symbol of the cross\r\nmade it quite clear that the \"poor inhabitant below\" died in the true\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 130. Demi-dolmen, near Poitiers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 131. Demi-dolmen at Kerland.]\r\n\r\nI have purposely refrained from speaking of rocking stones, which play\r\nso important a part in the forms of Druidical worship invented by\r\nStukeley, Borlase, and the antiquaries of the last century, because\r\nI believe that nine-tenths of those found in this country--if not\r\nall--are merely natural phenomena. So far from being surprised that\r\nthis should be the case, the wonder is that they are not more frequent\r\nwhere loose boulders abound, either ice-borne or freed by the washing\r\naway of the underlying strata. That some of these should rest in an\r\nunstable equilibrium easily disturbed is only what might be expected,\r\nand that they would also be matters of marvel to the country people\r\naround is also natural; but it does not follow from this that any\r\npriests purposely and designedly placed, or could place, rude stones in\r\nsuch positions, or that they used them for religious purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 132. Pierre Martine.]\r\n\r\nIn France, however, there is one called the Pierre Martine, near\r\nLivernon, in the department of the Lot, which was designedly balanced,\r\nif any one was. Its general appearance will be understood from the\r\npreceding woodcut, taken from 'La France monumentale et pittoresque,'\r\nwhich correctly represents its form and appearance.[411] The cap-stone\r\nmeasures 22 feet by 11 feet, and is 16 inches in thickness, and is so\r\nbalanced on its two points of support that a slight pressure of the\r\nhand is sufficient to set it oscillating with a motion which it retains\r\nfor some time.[412]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 133. Pierre Martine. From Bonstetten.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 134. Pierre Branlante, in Brittany.]\r\n\r\nAnother and more celebrated one, in Brittany, which is known as the\r\nPierre branlante de Huelgoat, seems rather due to accident. It looks\r\nas if it formed, or was intended to form, part of a demi-dolmen, but\r\nhappening to rest on one of its supports so as to oscillate, it has\r\nbeen allowed to remain so. Even assuming, however, that this was done\r\ndesignedly, what would it prove beyond the desire which pervades\r\nall these monuments, of exciting astonishment by _tours de force_.\r\nI believe it is correct to say that no passage exists in any book\r\nancient or medieval which mentions rocking stones or their uses; nor\r\nhas anyone been able to explain how they delivered their oracles. A\r\ncertain push produced an oscillation, not fitful or irregular, but\r\nalways in proportion to the force applied; so the answer must always\r\nhave been the same and alike to all people. A still more important\r\nfact is that nowhere do the people appeal to them now. Neither at the\r\nBeltane nor at Halloween, nor at any of those festivals where country\r\npeople revive every extinct superstition to aid them in prying into\r\nfuturity, are these rocking stones appealed to; and it seems almost\r\nimpossible that, when so many other superstitions have survived, this\r\none should be lost, and lost in presence of the rocks themselves, which\r\nstill remain. Wonders they certainly are, but I question much if they\r\never were appealed to for any higher purpose than that of extracting\r\nsixpences from the pockets of gaping tourists.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARNAC.\r\n\r\nIn a zone about twenty miles in extent, stretching from Erdeven on the\r\nnorth-west to Tumiac in a south-easterly direction, and nowhere more\r\nthan five miles in width, there is to be found the most remarkable\r\ngroup of megalithic remains, not only in France, but perhaps in the\r\nwhole world. Not only are examples of every class of monument we\r\nhave been describing, except circles, to be found here, but they are\r\nlarger and finer examples than are generally to be met with elsewhere.\r\nAnother point of interest also is that within the zone are found--if I\r\nam not mistaken--both a cemetery and a battle-field. At least in the\r\nneighbourhood of Locmariaker, which there seems no reason for doubting\r\nwas the Dariorigum of the Romans, the capital of the Venetes in Cæsar's\r\ntimes,[413] all the monuments are more or less sculptured, and all the\r\nstones fashioned, not to say hewn. On the other hand, no stone in the\r\nneighbourhood of Carnac is hewn, or even fashioned, beyond splitting,\r\nand no sculptures of any class have been traced. The distinction is too\r\nmarked to be accidental, and unless it can be made out that they belong\r\nto different ages, which appears to me most improbable, goes far to\r\nestablish the conclusion at which we have arrived in previous chapters.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the Carnac monument,[414] which is the best known and the\r\nmost important. As will be seen by the woodcut on p. 352, it consists\r\nof two separate alignments, or great stone rows--one, that of Carnac,\r\nextending for nearly two miles in a direction nearly east and west; the\r\nother, that of Erdeven, at a distance of two miles and a half from that\r\nat Carnac, being little more than one mile in length. There is a third,\r\nbut smaller, group at St.-Barbe, about a mile and a half due south of\r\nErdeven; and numerous dolmens and tumuli are spread at intervals all\r\nover the plain.\r\n\r\nIn order to be understood, the Carnac monument must again be subdivided\r\ninto three portions. Beginning at Le Maenec (the Stones), we have\r\neleven rows of very fine stones, measuring from 11 feet to 13 feet in\r\nheight from the ground, and still nearly perfect. Gradually, however,\r\nthey become smaller and more sparse, till, when they reach the road\r\nfrom Auray to Carnac, there are few of them that measure 3 feet in\r\nany direction, and some are still smaller. Shortly after passing that\r\nroad the avenues cease altogether, for a distance of more than 300\r\nyards, there being nothing but a few natural boulders in the interval\r\nbetween. When, however, we reach the knoll on which the farm of\r\nKermario stands, the avenues reappear, this time only ten in number,\r\nbut perfectly regular, and with stones as large and as regularly spaced\r\nas those at Maenec. They diminish more and more in size, however, and\r\nalmost die out altogether before they reach the mound (tumulus?) on\r\nwhich the windmill stands, and after that become so small and sparse\r\nthat a stranger riding across the line could hardly remark that they\r\nwere artificially disposed, but would merely regard it as a stony\r\npiece of land. They again cease entirely before we reach the brook, to\r\nrecommence at Kerlescant, where thirteen rows are found; but these are\r\ncomposed of stones of less dimensions and more irregularly spaced than\r\nthose at Maenec, and die out much more rapidly. At a distance of less\r\nthan 500 yards from the head of the column they disappear entirely.\r\nIt may be suggested that these gaps arise from the stones having been\r\nremoved for agricultural and other purposes. I think, however, that\r\nany one who carefully examines the spot will be convinced that we\r\nreally now possess all, or nearly all, that were ever placed here.\r\nThey are thickest and best preserved in the village of Maenec, and at\r\nKermario, where buildings are most frequent, and they disappear exactly\r\nin those places where there are no buildings or walls, but where the\r\nground is an open, barren heath, without roads, and whence it would\r\nbe very difficult to transport them; and in so stony a country it is\r\nvery improbable that the attempt would be made. Besides this, the\r\ngradual way in which they diminish in size before disappearing shows\r\na regularity of design, regarding which there can be no mistake. In\r\naddition to this, the heads of the three divisions are all marked by\r\nmonuments of different kinds, but which are easily recognizable. At\r\nthe head of the Maenec division there is a curvilinear enclosure of\r\nsmaller stones, none of them being more than 6 feet in height, but set\r\nmuch closer together than the rows (woodcut No. 136). It probably was\r\nonce complete, and, if so, joined the centre stone row. At Kermario,\r\na dolmen stands in front of the alignment, not remarkable for its\r\nsize, but conspicuous from its position; and at Kerlescant there is\r\na quadrangular[415] enclosure, three sides of which are composed of\r\nstones of smaller size and set closely together, like those at Maenec.\r\nThe fourth side is formed by a tumulus or long barrow. This was dug\r\ninto in 1851, by some persons with or without authority; but who they\r\nwere, or what they found, is not recorded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 135. MAP OF SOME CELTIC ANTIQUITIES _IN THE\r\nNEIGHBOURHOOD_ OF CARNAC]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 136.]\r\n\r\nThe monument at Erdeven is very inferior in scale to that at Carnac,\r\nand planned on a different principle. Instead of the heads of the\r\ndivision following one another, as at Carnac, they face outwards;\r\nand, like the fabled Amphisbena, this group has two heads, one at\r\neach end. The principal one is the western, where there is a group of\r\nvery large stones close to the road, but rather confusedly arranged.\r\nThere seem to be nine or ten rows, and a row of large stones branches\r\noff at right angles to the north. After extending about 100 yards the\r\nmain column dies out, and is resumed again at a distance of 200 yards,\r\nin smaller stones much more widely spaced. It is again and again so\r\ninterrupted, that it is sometimes difficult to trace it till we come\r\nnear the eastern end, where it resumes its regularity, possessing eight\r\nwell-defined rows of stones similar to those at the west end.[416]\r\n\r\nAt the west end there can still be traced the remains of what was once\r\na tumulus, and, beyond that, a single standing menhir. At the east end\r\nthere is a tumulus of a somewhat oval form, and in the centre, a hill,\r\nor rising ground, apparently natural, on which are placed two dolmens;\r\nand, south of the east end, a second hill or mound with two more\r\nsimilar monuments.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to guess whether the lines of St.-Barbe were ever more\r\ncomplete than we now find them. My own impression is that we have them\r\nnow very nearly as originally completed. The head facing the west seems\r\nto have been intended for a curvilinear enclosure similar to that at\r\nMaenec, but is now, at least, very incomplete. Its most remarkable\r\nfeature is the group of stones at its head (woodcut No. 137), two of\r\nwhich are the largest and finest blocks in the neighbourhood. The\r\nfarthest away in the view is 19 feet long by 12 feet broad, and 8\r\nfeet thick; the other, seen in the foreground, even exceeds it in\r\ndimensions. Whether these are like the Coffin stones at Aylesford, or\r\nthe two stones found among the stone rows at Dartmoor, or have, indeed,\r\nany separate meaning, must be left to be determined when we know more\r\nof the general scheme on which these monuments were planned.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing at present but juxtaposition to justify us in\r\nconnecting these great stone rows with the smaller groups of stones and\r\nthe dolmens or tumuli which stud the plain where they are found. In\r\nrespect to these, what we find at Carnac seems the exact converse of\r\nwhat exists at Stonehenge and Stennis. There the great stone monuments\r\nstand among the pigmy barrows of another race and age. Here all are\r\nmegalithic and all seem to have been erected nearly at the same time,\r\nand to belong to one people, whoever they may eventually be proved to\r\nhave been. In so far as any argument as to their age is concerned, it\r\nis at present of little importance whether this is so or not, for they\r\nare all equally uncommunicative on this subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 137. Head of Column at St.-Barbe. From Messrs. Blair and\r\nRonalds' work.]\r\n\r\nOne of the tumuli known as Mont St.-Michel, is so situated with\r\nrespect to the Maenec row that it seems impossible to dissociate the\r\ntwo. It was opened by M. René Galles in 1862, and an account of his\r\nresearches, in the form of a report to the Préfet, was published\r\nshortly afterwards. The mound itself, at its base, is nearly 400 feet\r\nin length by half that dimension in width. In modern times its summit\r\nhas been levelled, to form a platform for the church which now occupies\r\nits eastern summit. In front of the church, M. Galles sunk a shaft\r\nnear the centre of the mound, and came upon a sepulchral chamber of\r\nirregular form, the side walls of which were formed of very irregular\r\nand bad masonry of small stones, similar to that of the dolmens at\r\nCrubelz. Its mean dimensions were about 6 feet by 5 feet, and 3 feet\r\n6 inches in height. In it were found some magnificent celts of jade\r\nand tribolite, nine pendents in jasper, and 101 beads in jasper, with\r\nsome in turquoise, all polished and pierced so as to form a necklace.\r\nThe human remains in the principal cell seem utterly to have perished,\r\nowing probably to the continued penetration of water since, at least,\r\nthe levelling of the summit, though some bones were subsequently found\r\nin a small chamber adjoining.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the avenue at Kerlescant, at a distance of about\r\n100 paces from it, is a second long barrow, consequently occupying\r\nthe same relative position to it that Mont St.-Michel does to that at\r\nMaenec. It is so similar in external appearance and general arrangement\r\nto that forming the north side of the enclosure, which terminates the\r\navenue, that there can be little doubt of their being of the same age\r\nand forming part of the same general arrangement. It had been opened\r\nsome twenty years ago by a gentleman residing at Carnac, but was\r\nre-examined in 1867 by the Rev. W. C. Lukis.[417]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 138. Long Barrow at Kerlescant.]\r\n\r\nIn the centre he found a long rectangular chamber, measuring 52 feet\r\nin length by 5 feet in width internally, and divided into two equal\r\ncompartments by two stones cut away in the centre, so as to leave a\r\nhole 1 foot 6 inches wide by 3 feet high. A similar but smaller hole\r\nexists on the side, and is identical with those found in the long\r\nbarrows at Rodmarton and Avening in Gloucestershire.[418] Mr. Lukis,\r\namong other things, found an immense quantity of broken pottery, some\r\nof very fine quality. Two vases which he was enabled to restore are\r\ninteresting from their general resemblance to the two which Mr. Bateman\r\nfound in Arbor Low (woodcut No. 31). Though not exactly the same in\r\nform, there can be little doubt that they belong to the same age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 139. Hole between Two Stones at Kerlescant.[419]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 141. Vases found at Kerlescant.]\r\n\r\nAbout a mile from this example, Mr. Lukis mentions a still larger\r\none. It measures 81 feet in length by 6 feet in width, is divided\r\ninto two compartments like the one just described, and has also a\r\nholed entrance. He also measured two in Finistère, one 76 feet, the\r\nother 66 feet, in length, and both 6 feet wide. Both, however, had\r\nbeen rifled long ago, and are now mere ruins. More, no doubt, would be\r\nfound if looked for. Indeed, these straight-lined \"allées couvertes,\"\r\nor \"Grottes des fées,\" without cells, as the French call them, as\r\nbefore mentioned, are the most characteristic, if not the most common,\r\nform of French rude-stone monuments. The only other place where they\r\nare equally common is Drenthe, and it may be that this side hole\r\nat Kerlescant is an approach to the side entrance so usual in that\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nAt Plouharnel, about a mile and a half westward from Mont St.-Michel, a\r\ndouble dolmen was opened a good many years ago. In it were found some\r\nbeautiful gold ornaments, others in bronze, and some celts or stone\r\naxes in jade[420]--all these, like those of Mont St.-Michel, belonging\r\nevidently to what antiquaries call the latest period of the Polished\r\nStone age; but until it is determined what that age is, it does not\r\nhelp us much to a date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 142. Plan of Moustoir-Carnac.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 143. Section of Moustoir-Carnac. From 'Mémoire' by René\r\nGalles.]\r\n\r\nTo the north of Kerlescant, at about the distance of half a mile,\r\nis another long barrow, called Moustoir or Moustoir-Carnac, which\r\nwas opened in 1865, also by M. René Galles. It was found to contain\r\nfour separate interments, dispersed along its length, which exceeds\r\n280 feet, the height varying from 15 to 20 feet. The western chamber\r\nis a regular dolmen, of the class called \"Grottes des fées,\" and is\r\napparently the oldest of the group. The centre one (_b_) is a very\r\nirregular chamber, the plan of which it is difficult to make out; the\r\nthird (_c_) is a dolmen, irregular in plan, but roofed with three\r\nlarge stones; but the fourth (_d_) is a circular chamber, the walls\r\nof which are formed of tolerably large stones, the roof being built\r\nup into the form of a horizontal dome (woodcut No. 144), by stones\r\nprojecting and overlapping, instead of the simpler ceiling of single\r\nblocks as on all the earlier monuments. This, as well as the walls,\r\nbeing built with small stones, I take to be a certain indication of\r\na more modern age. A considerable number of flint implements were\r\nfound in the western chamber, with some beads and a partially pierced\r\ncylinder in serpentine, but no coins, nor any object of an age which\r\ncan be positively dated. Here, however, these troublesome Roman tiles\r\nmake their appearance as at Crubelz. \"Ici, comme à Mané er H'roëk,\r\nnous trouvons les traces caractéristiques du conquerant (les Romains):\r\ndes tuiles à rebord ont croulé, au pied de notre butte funéraire, et\r\nplusieurs même se sont glissées à travers les couches supérieures des\r\npierres, qui forment une partie de la masse.\"[421]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 144. Section of Chamber _d_ of Moustier-Carnac.]\r\n\r\nIf these monuments are really prehistoric, it is to me incomprehensible\r\nthat these traces of the Romans should be so generally prevalent in\r\ntheir structure. If it is objected that these are not found in the\r\nchambers of the tombs themselves, the answer seems only too evident\r\nthat hardly one of them is virgin: all, or nearly all, have been\r\nentered before the time of recent explorers, and all their more\r\nvaluable contents removed. Celts and beads and stone implements were\r\nnot likely to attract the attention of early pilferers, and these they\r\nleft; but except in the instance of the sepulchre at Plouharnel, metal\r\nis very rarely found in any. But the presence of Roman pottery, or\r\nother evidence of that people, in the long barrows in Gloucestershire,\r\nat Kennet, and at Carnac, are too frequent to be accidental. In so far\r\nas proving that the monument is not prehistoric, the presence of a\r\nsingle fragment of Roman pottery is as conclusive as a hoard of coins\r\nwould be, provided it is found so placed that it could not have been\r\ninserted there after the mound was complete; and this I fancy is the\r\ncase in all the instances mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCMARIAKER.\r\n\r\nIt is rather to be regretted that no good survey exists of this\r\ncemetery. Not that much depends on the juxtaposition of the monuments,\r\nbut that, as the French are continually changing their names, and most\r\nof them have two, it is not always easy to feel sure which monument\r\nis being spoken of at any particular time. Those on the mainland are\r\nsituated in a zone about a mile in length, running north and south,\r\nbetween Mané Lud, the most northern, and Mané er H'roëk, the most\r\nsouthern. The first-named is a long barrow, 260 feet by about 165,\r\nbut not, as in England, of one age or containing only one, but, like\r\nMoustoir-Carnac, several sepulchres, which may either be of the same\r\nage or erected at different though hardly distant periods, and joined\r\ntogether by being buried under one great mound. Of the three which Mané\r\nLud contains, the most interesting is the partially covered dolmen at\r\nthe west end. It consists of a chamber of somewhat irregular form, but\r\nmeasuring 12 feet by 10 feet, and covered by one enormous block of\r\nstone, measuring 29 feet by 15 feet, and with a passage leading to it,\r\nmaking the whole length from the entrance to the central block of the\r\nchamber 20 feet. According to Mr. Ferguson,[422] five of the blocks\r\nof this dolmen are sculptured; according to M. René Galles,[423] nine\r\nare so ornamented. The stone, however, is so rough and the place so\r\ndark that it is difficult at times to distinguish them and always so\r\nto draw them. The principal objects represented seem to be intended\r\nfor boats and hatchets, but there are other figures which cannot be\r\nso classed, and, though it may be rash to call them writing, they may\r\nmean numbers or cyphers of some sort. Their great interest is, however,\r\ntheir similarity to the engravings on Irish monuments. If any one will,\r\nfor instance, compare this woodcut (No. 145) and woodcut No. 68 from\r\nNew Grange, he can hardly fail to see a likeness which cannot well be\r\naccidental; and in like manner the curvilinear forms of woodcut No.\r\n146, in a manner hardly to be mistaken, resemble those from Clover Hill\r\n(woodcut No. 77).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 145. Sculpture at Mané Lud.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 146. Sculpture at Mané Lud.[424]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 147. View of Dol ar Marchant. From Blair and Ronald.]\r\n\r\nClose by Mané Lud, but a little nearer to Locmariaker, stands what may\r\nbe considered as the most interesting, if not the finest, free-standing\r\ndolmen in France. Its roof consists of two stones: one of these\r\nmeasures 18 feet by 9 feet,[425] and more than 3 feet in thickness. The\r\nsecond stone is very much smaller, and seems to form a sort of porch to\r\nit. The great stone rests, like that of most free-standing dolmens, on\r\nthree points, their architects having early learned how difficult it\r\nwas to make sure of their resting on more; so that unless they wanted a\r\nwall to keep out the stuff out of which the tumulus was to be composed,\r\nthey generally poised them on three points like that at Castle Wellan\r\n(woodcut No. 7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 148. End Stone, Dol ar Marchant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 149. Hatchet in roof of Dol ar Marchant.]\r\n\r\nThe great interest in this dolmen, however, lies in its sculptures. The\r\nstone which closes the east end is shaped into the form of two sides of\r\nan equilateral spherical triangle and covered with sculptures, which\r\nthis time are neither characters nor representations of living things,\r\nbut purely decorative. At one time I thought the form of a cross could\r\nbe traced on the stone. The central stem and the upper arm are shown\r\nclearly enough in the drawing by Mr. Ferguson; but all the drawings\r\nshow a lower cross-arm--though I confess I did not see it--which quite\r\ndestroys this idea. On the roof a well-sculptured plumed[426] hatchet\r\ncan be traced very distinctly, as shown in the woodcut copied from Mr.\r\nFerguson. He fancies he can also trace the form of a plough in the\r\nsculptures of the roof, but this seems doubtful.\r\n\r\nIt is to this dolmen that the great fallen obelisk belongs. If it\r\nwas one stone, it measured 64 feet in length and 13 feet across its\r\ngreatest diameter; but I confess I cannot, from the mode in which it\r\nhas fallen, rid myself of the idea that it was in reality two obelisks,\r\nand not one. Whether this was the case or not, it is a remarkable work\r\nof art for a rude people, for it certainly has been shaped with care,\r\nand with the same amount of labour might have been made square or round\r\nor any other shape that might have been desired. This, however, is\r\none of the peculiarities of the style. No one will dispute that this\r\nobelisk and the stones of the Dol ar Marchant are hewn; but instead of\r\nadopting the geometrical forms, of which we are so fond, they preferred\r\nthose that reminded them of their old rude monuments, and which to\r\ntheir eyes were more beautiful than the straight lines of the Romans. I\r\ndo not feel quite sure that artistically they were not right.\r\n\r\nIf we compare this dolmen with that at Krukenho (woodcut No. 126), the\r\ndifference between them appears very striking. The Del ar Marchant is a\r\nregular tripod dolmen, carefully built of shaped stones and engraved.\r\nThe other is a magnificent cist, walled with rude stones, and such as\r\nwould form a chamber in a tumulus if buried in one, though whether this\r\nparticular example was ever intended to be so treated or not is by no\r\nmeans clear. Be this as it may, there are two modes of accounting for\r\nthe difference between two monuments so nearly alike in dimensions and\r\nsituated so near to one another. The first would be to assume that the\r\nKrukenho example is the oldest, it being the rudest and approaching\r\nmore nearly to the primitive form of the monuments: the second would\r\nbe to assume that the one was the memorial of some warrior, erected in\r\nhaste on the battle-field where he fell, by his companions in arms;\r\nand that the other was a royal sepulchre, prepared at leisure either\r\nby the king himself or by those who succeeded him in times of peace,\r\nand consequently who had leisure for such works. We must know more of\r\nthese monuments before a satisfactory choice can be made between these\r\ntwo hypotheses. At present I rather incline to the belief that the\r\ncircumstances under which they were erected may have more to do with\r\ntheir differences than their relative ages.\r\n\r\nTo return to Locmariaker. Close to the town there is, or was, a long\r\nallée couverte.[427] It is 70 feet long, and divided towards its inner\r\nend into a square chamber, to which a long-slightly curved gallery\r\nled, composed of fourteen stones on each side. Five of these are\r\ncovered with ornaments, and characters engraved on them. One might be\r\nconsidered as representing the leaf of a fern, or possibly a palm; the\r\nrest are ovals, circles, and similar ornaments, which may or may not\r\nhave more meaning than those at New Grange or other monuments in the\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 150. Stone found inside Chamber at Mané er H'roëk.]\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the village is the tumulus already mentioned as\r\nMané er H'roëk, where the twelve Roman coins were found, and inside\r\nit an immense collection of polished celts, but all broken, and one\r\nslab, which apparently originally closed the door, and is covered with\r\nsculptured hatchets, similar in character to that on the roof of the\r\nDol ar Marchant, but not so carefully drawn nor so well engraved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 151. Plan of Gavr Innis.]\r\n\r\nBesides these there are several--probably as many as a dozen--monuments\r\nof the same class, within what may fairly be considered the limits of\r\nthis cemetery; but of these the most interesting, as well as the most\r\nperfect, is that on the island of Gavr Innis, about 2 miles eastward\r\nfrom Locmariaker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 152. Sculptures at Gavr Innis. From a drawing by Sir\r\nHenry Dryden.[428]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 153. Holed Stone, Gavr Innis. From a drawing by Sir\r\nHenry Dryden.]\r\n\r\nThe plan of the chamber of this monument will be understood from the\r\nannexed plan.[429] The gallery of entrance measures 44 feet from where\r\nthe lining stones begin to the chamber, which is quadrangular in\r\nform, and measures 9 feet by 8 feet. All the six stones forming the\r\nthree sides of the chamber, and most of those which line the entrance\r\non either hand, are most elaborately sculptured with patterns, the\r\ncharacter of which will be understood from the annexed woodcuts. The\r\npattern, it will be observed, is not so flowing or graceful as those\r\nfound at New Grange or Dowth, and nowhere, I believe, can it be said\r\nto imitate vegetable forms; and in the woodcut on the left-hand stone\r\nare some seventeen or eighteen figures, which are generally supposed\r\nto represent celts, and probably do so; but if they do, from their\r\nposition they must mean something more, either numbers or names, but,\r\nwhatever it may be, its meaning has not yet been guessed. On other\r\nstones there are waving lines, which are very generally assumed to\r\nrepresent serpents, and, I believe, correctly so; but as that is\r\nsomewhat doubtful, it is as well to refrain from citing them. Besides\r\nthese, the general pattern is circles within circles, and flowing\r\nlines nearly equidistant, but, except on one stone, never of spirals,\r\nand then less graceful than the Irish. The sculpture, however, on some\r\nof the stones at Lough Crew, and that in the centre especially of\r\nwoodcut No. 75, is absolutely identical with the patterns found here;\r\nand altogether there is more similarity between these sculptures and\r\nthose at Lough Crew than between almost any other monuments of the\r\nclass that I know of.\r\n\r\nIn the chamber on the left-hand side is a stone (woodcut No. 153),\r\nwith three holes in it, which have given rise to an unlimited amount\r\nof speculation. Generally it is assumed that it was here that the\r\nDruids tied up the human victims whom they were about to sacrifice.\r\nBut, without going back to the question as to whether there ever were\r\nany Druids in the Morbihan, would any priest choose a small dungeon 8\r\nfeet square and absolutely dark for the performance of one of their\r\ngreatest and most solemn rites? So far as we know anything of human\r\nsacrifices, they were always performed in the open day and in the\r\npresence of multitudes. Assuming for the moment, however, that these\r\nholes were intended for some such purpose, two would have sufficed, and\r\nthese of a form much simpler and more easily cut. As will be seen from\r\nthe woodcut, not only are the three holes joined, but a ledge or trough\r\nis sunk below them which might hold oil or holy water, and must, it\r\nappears to me, have been intended for some such purpose.\r\n\r\nThe existence of these holes seems to set at rest another question of\r\nsome interest. Generally it has been assumed that the tattooing on the\r\nstones of the chambers, &c., may have been done with stone implements.\r\nThis cannot be denied, though it seems improbable; but the undercutting\r\nof the passages between these holes and the formation of the trough\r\ncould only be effected by a tool which would bear a blow on its head,\r\nand a heavy one too, or, in other words, by some well-tempered metal\r\ntool.\r\n\r\nAt Tumiac, opposite Gavr Innis, existed a very large tumulus, which\r\nwas opened in 1853 by Messrs. Fouquet and L. Galles. It was found to\r\ncontain a small chamber, partly formed of large slabs, partly of small\r\nstones. Some of the former had rude carvings upon them, but without any\r\nmeaning that can now be made out.\r\n\r\nThe whole has the appearance of being considerably more modern than\r\nGavr Innis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesides these, in the neighbourhood of Carnac and Locmariaker, there\r\nare at least three other groups of stones in France which deserve much\r\nmore attention than has hitherto been bestowed upon them. The first is\r\nin the peninsula of Crozon, forming the southern side of the roadstead\r\nof Brest. It consists, among others, of three alignments of stones. The\r\nprincipal one is at a place called Kerdouadec, and consists of a single\r\nline of stones 1600 feet in length, arranged on a slightly curved plan,\r\nand terminating in a curious \"Swastica\"-like cross. The second, at\r\nCarmaret, is a single line, 900 feet long, and with two branches at\r\nright angles to it, near its centre. The third, at Leuré, is likewise\r\na single line with a slight elbow in the centre, from which starts a\r\nshort branch at right angles.[430]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 154. Alignments at Crozon.]\r\n\r\nI am not able to offer a conjecture what these alignments represent,\r\nnor why or when they were placed here. Whether an inspection on the\r\nspot might suggest some clue is not clear, but they are so unlike\r\nanything found anywhere else, either in France or any other country,\r\nthat they must for the present, I fear, remain a mystery.\r\n\r\nThe second group, known as the Gré de Cojou, is situated about halfway\r\nbetween Rennes and Redon. The remains here consist of a short double\r\nalignment some 500 feet long, several tumuli--one at least surmounted\r\nby a circle of stones--several stone enclosures, and frequent dolmens.\r\nThey have been imperfectly described by M. Ramé,[431] and planned,\r\nbut not published, by Sir Henry Dryden. Until these are given to the\r\nworld more in detail than has hitherto been done, it is impossible to\r\nsay whether they represent a battle-field or a cemetery. From their\r\nposition--a bleak, barren heath, far from any centre of population--I\r\nwould guess the former; but I have not visited the place myself, and\r\nthe information at my command is too meagre to enable me to speak with\r\nany confidence regarding them.\r\n\r\nThe third group is in the department of the Lot, near Preissac, in\r\nthe parish of Junies, and extends over half a mile (800 metres) in\r\nlength. Unfortunately we have nothing but verbal descriptions of it,\r\nand from these it is impossible to realise its form, or predicate its\r\ndestination.[432] We are, indeed, in a state of great ignorance with\r\nregard to all these megalithic remains in the south of France, but as\r\nthey seem as important and as numerous as those in the north, it is to\r\nbe hoped some one will devote an autumn to their illustration. There\r\nare probably several other groups as important as those at Junies, but\r\nthey are quite unknown to us at present. These groups must therefore\r\nbe put aside for the present, and any argument regarding age or use of\r\nthis class of monuments must be based wholly on what we know of those\r\nof the Morbihan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, no reasonable tradition attaches to any of the\r\nmonuments in the Locmariaker cemetery which would enable us to fix\r\ntheir dates with anything like certainty, nor are there any local\r\ncircumstances, except the Roman coins and tiles above alluded to, which\r\naid us in our researches. We are thus left to such general inferences\r\nas the case admits of, and to a comparison with other similar monuments\r\nwhose dates are nearer and better ascertained. No one, however, who is\r\nfamiliar with the two great cemeteries of Meath will probably hesitate\r\nin admitting that the two groups cannot be far separated in date. Of\r\ncourse, it is impossible in a general work like the present to put the\r\nevidence forward in anything like a complete state. In order to do\r\nthis in a satisfactory manner would require a large volume to itself,\r\nand the illustrations both of the French and Irish examples should be\r\ndrawn by the same person. Even the few illustrations that have been\r\ngiven are probably sufficient to show a similarity so great that it\r\ncan hardly be accidental, and I may be allowed to add, from personal\r\nfamiliarity with both groups of monuments, that it seems impossible\r\nto escape the conviction that they are monuments of the same class,\r\nprobably of the same or a closely allied race, and of about the same\r\nage. This last must always be the most uncertain premiss of the three,\r\nas we can scarcely hope ever to know the relative state of civilization\r\nof the two countries at a given time; and consequently, even if we\r\ncould prove that two ornaments in the two countries were identical in\r\nform, this would not prove that there might not be a difference of\r\nfifty or a hundred years between them. Even at a later age, in the\r\nthirteenth century, for instance, the same form and the same style in\r\nFrance and England did not prevent a difference of fifty years existing\r\nbetween any two examples. In the fourteenth the two were abreast, and\r\nin the fifteenth century they again diverged, so that, although the\r\narchitecture of both was still Gothic, a comparison of style for this\r\npurpose became almost impossible.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, though the central ornament in the middle stone at\r\nLough Crew (woodcut No. 75) is almost identical with some of the\r\nornaments at Gavr Innis (woodcut No. 152), it by no means necessarily\r\nfollows that the two are exactly of the same age. So, too, the foliage\r\nat New Grange (woodcut No. 67) and that in the allée--now, I fear,\r\ndestroyed--at Locmariaker are evidently of one style, but still admit\r\nof a certain latitude of date. On the whole, judging from style alone,\r\nI should feel inclined to range Gavr Innis rather with the cemetery at\r\nLough Crew than with that on the Boyne; as well from its ornaments as\r\nbecause I fancy that those monuments which are roofed with flat stones\r\nonly are earlier than those which make some attempt at construction.\r\nBut, on the other hand, I believe that Mané er H'roëk and Mané Lud may\r\nmore probably range with New Grange and Dowth; and as I look upon it\r\nas quite certain that the monuments on the Boyne were all erected in\r\nthe first four centuries after the birth of Christ, it seems impossible\r\nthat the age of those at Locmariaker can be very distant from that date.\r\n\r\nTo many it will no doubt seem improbable that these monuments should\r\nhave been erected during the occupation of the country by the Romans.\r\nIf, however, they would take the trouble of studying what is now going\r\non in India, their incredulity would, I fancy, soon disappear. The\r\nnatives there at the present day are in many parts of the country\r\nbuilding temples which it requires a practised eye to distinguish from\r\nthose erected before any European settled in the land; and they follow\r\ntheir own customs, and worship their own gods, utterly irrespective of,\r\nand uninfluenced by, the strangers who have held the chief sway in the\r\ncountry for more than a hundred years. It must also be borne in mind\r\nthat the Romans never really settled in Brittany. The country was poor\r\nthen as now, and it led to nowhere. So long as the Bretons remained\r\nquiet, the Romans seem to have left them to themselves, and certainly\r\nhave left no traces of any establishment of importance in their\r\ncountry--nothing that would lead us to suspect such intimate relations\r\nwith the natives as would induce them to change their faith or fashions\r\nand copy the institutions of the foreigners.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it seems not only possible, but probable, that\r\nintercourse with the Romans may first have inspired the inhabitants\r\nof Brittany with a desire to attain greater durability and more\r\nmagnificence, by the employment of stone, instead of earth or wood,\r\nfor their monuments. This they might do, without its creating in\r\ntheir minds the smallest desire to copy either Roman forms or Roman\r\ninstitutions. On the contrary, we have every reason to believe that in\r\nthese remote districts the Romans would be hated as conquerors, and\r\nthat their religion and their customs would be held in abhorrence as\r\nstrange and unsuited to the land they occupied.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, a comparison with the Irish examples reduces the\r\nquestions at issue with regard to dates within very narrow limits.\r\nEither these monuments were erected immediately before or during the\r\ntime of the Roman occupation or immediately after their departure,\r\nbut prior to the conversion of the natives to Christianity. We are not\r\nyet in a position to decide positively between these two hypotheses,\r\nbut the presence of Roman coins and Roman tiles in some of the mounds\r\nand the whole aspect of the argument seem to me to incline the balance\r\nin favour of their belonging to Roman times. Some may be anterior to\r\nthe Christian era, but I am very much mistaken if it be not eventually\r\nadmitted that the greater number of them are subsequent to that epoch.\r\n\r\nEven, however, if the age of the monuments of the cemetery of\r\nLocmariaker could be ascertained, it would by no means necessarily\r\ncarry with it that of the stone rows at Carnac. They belong to a\r\ndifferent category altogether, and may be of a different age.\r\n\r\nNo one now, I presume, after what has been said above, especially with\r\nregard to the Scandinavian examples, will think it necessary that I\r\nshould go over the ground to prove that they are not temples. Every\r\nargument that could be adduced to prove that Avebury or Stonehenge are\r\nnot temples tells with tenfold force here. A temple extending over six\r\nor seven miles of country is more improbable than one covering only\r\n28 acres. This one, too, is open everywhere, and has no enclosure or\r\n\"temenos\" of any sort, and there being an uneven number of equally\r\nspaced rows of stones in the principal monument is sufficient to show\r\nit was not intended and could not be used for processions. In fact I\r\nhardly know of any proposition that appears to me so manifestly absurd\r\nas that these stone rows were temples, and I feel sure that no one who\r\nthinks twice of the matter will venture again to affirm it.\r\n\r\nIt seems equally clear that they were not erected for any civic or\r\ncivil purpose. No meetings could be held, and no administrative\r\nfunctions could be carried on in or around them. Nor are they\r\nsepulchral in any ordinary sense of the term. In the first place\r\nbecause, though men were buried in tumuli or under dolmens, or had\r\nsingle head-stones, nowhere were men buried in rows like this,\r\nextending over miles of heath and barren country. But the great fact\r\nis that the French savants have dug repeatedly about these stones and\r\nfound no trace of burials. The most conclusive experiment of the sort\r\nwas made by a road surveyor some six or seven years ago. Wishing to\r\nraise the road from Auray to Carnac, he dug out the sand and gravel on\r\nthe east side of the road, over a considerable area, to a depth of from\r\nthree to four feet; but being of a conservative turn of mind, he left\r\nthe eleven rows of stones each standing on a little pillar of sand. It\r\nwas then easy to trace the undisturbed strata of differently coloured\r\nearth round and almost under the stones, and to feel perfectly certain\r\nthat it had never been disturbed by any inhumation. It, no doubt, is\r\ntrue that the long barrow at Kerlescant, the dolmen at Kermario, and\r\nthe enclosure at Maenec, may have been, indeed most probably were,\r\nall of them, burying-places, but they can no more be considered the\r\nmonument than the drums and fifes can be considered the regiment. They\r\nare only the adjuncts; the great rows must be considered as essentially\r\nthe monuments.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, they are neither temples, nor town-halls, nor even\r\nsepulchres, we are driven back on the only remaining group of motives\r\nwhich, so far as I know, ever induced mankind to expend time and labour\r\non the erection of perfectly unutilitarian erections. They must be\r\ntrophies--the memorials of some great battle or battles that at some\r\ntime or other were fought out on this plain. The fact of the head of\r\neach division being a tomb is in favour of this hypothesis; but if it\r\nis considered as the principal part, it is like drawing a jackdaw with\r\na peacock's tail--an absurdity into which these men of the olden time\r\nwould hardly fall.\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to answer the questions, Are Carnac and Erdeven\r\nparts of one great design, or two separate monuments? Is Carnac the\r\nmarch, St.-Barbe the position before the battle, Erdeven the scene\r\nof the final struggle for the heights that gave the victory, and the\r\ntombs scattered over the plain between these alignments the graves of\r\nthose who fell in that fight? Such appears to me the only feasible\r\nexplanation of what we here find; but the great question still remains,\r\nWhat fight?\r\n\r\nThere is, probably, no single instance in which the negative argument\r\nderived from the silence of the classical authors applies with such\r\nforce as to this. If these stones existed when Cæsar waged war against\r\nthe Veneti in this quarter, he must have seen them, and as it may be\r\npresumed that the monument was then more complete than it is now, he\r\ncould hardly have failed to be struck with it, and, if so, to have\r\nmentioned it in his 'Commentaries.' Even, however, if he neglected\r\nthem, the officers of his army must have seen these stones. They must\r\nhave been talked about in Rome, and some gossip like Pliny, when\r\nwriting about stones, must have heard of this wonderful group, and\r\nhave alluded to it in some way. The silence, however, is absolute. No\r\nmediæval rhapsodist even attempts to give them a pre-Roman origin.\r\nSuch traditions as that of St. Cornely, or Cornelius the Centurion,\r\nthough absurd enough, point, as such traditions generally do, to the\r\ntransition time between paganism and Christianity, when, apparently,\r\nall mediæval chroniclers seem to have believed that all these\r\nrude-stone monuments were erected. Till, therefore, some stronger\r\nargument than has yet been adduced, or some new analogy be suggested,\r\nthe pre-Roman theory must be set aside; and if this is so, we are\r\ntolerably safe in assuming that no battle of sufficient importance was\r\nfought which these stones could be erected to commemorate during the\r\ntime when the Romans held supreme sway in the country.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, our choice of an event to be represented by these great\r\nstone rows is limited to the period which elapsed between the overthrow\r\nof the Roman power by Maximus, A.D. 383, and the time when the\r\npeople of the country were completely converted to Christianity--which\r\nhappened in the early part of the sixth century.[433] But if the\r\nhistory of England is confused and uncertain during that century and a\r\nhalf, that of Brittany is even more so, and has not yet been elucidated\r\nby the French authorities to the same extent as ours has been.\r\n\r\nNo one, I believe, doubts that Maximus, coming with an army from\r\nBritain, landed somewhere in Brittany, where he fought a great battle\r\nwith the forces of Gratian, whom he defeated, and that afterwards,\r\nin a second battle near Lyons, he expelled the legitimate government\r\nof the Romans from Gaul.[434] I also see no reason for doubting that\r\nhe was accompanied by a British prince Conan Meriadec, who afterwards\r\nsettled in the country with thousands of his emigrant countrymen, over\r\nwhom he was enabled to establish his chieftainship on the ruins of the\r\nRoman power.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, the battle which destroyed the Roman power, and gave\r\nrise to the native dynasty, would be worthy of such a monument as that\r\nat Carnac; but so far as local traditions go, the place where Maximus\r\nand his British allies landed was near St. Malo, and the battle was\r\nfought at a place called Alleth, near St. Servan.[435] If this is so,\r\nit was too far off to have any connection with the Carnac stones. Two\r\nother wars seem to have been carried on by Conan, one in 410 against\r\na people who are merely called barbarians,[436] a second against the\r\nRomans under Exuperantius in 416;[437] but we have no local particulars\r\nwhich would enable us to connect these wars with our stones. A war of\r\nliberation against Rome would be worthy of a national monument, and\r\nit may be that this is such a one, but I know of nothing to connect\r\nthe two together, though local enquiries on the spot might remove this\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, I am more inclined to look among the events of\r\nthe next reign for a key to the riddle. Grallon was engaged in two\r\nwars at least: one against the Roman consul Liberius in 439,[438]\r\nin which he succeeded in frustrating the attempts of that people to\r\nrecover their lost power; the other against the \"Norman pirates;\"[439]\r\nand it is to this, as connecting the stone monuments with a Northern\r\npeople, that I should be inclined to ascribe the erection of the Carnac\r\nalignments. From Grallon being the reputed founder of Landevenec, it\r\nmight seem more probable that the alignments at Crozon marked the\r\nposition of this battle, and I am not prepared to dispute that it may\r\nbe so. The question is not of importance; if either group marked a\r\nbattle-field of this period, the other certainly did so also, and I\r\nwould prefer to refrain from offering any opinion as to what particular\r\nbattle these stones commemorate. That must be determined by some\r\nlocal antiquary with much more intimate knowledge of the history and\r\ntraditions of the province than I possess. All I wish to show here is\r\nthat there was a period of a century and a half between the departure\r\nof the Romans and the time when the Bretons were so completely\r\nconverted to Christianity as to abandon their old habits and customs,\r\nand that during that period there were wars with the Romans and the\r\nNorthern barbarians of sufficient importance to justify the erection\r\nof any monuments within the competence of the people. If this is so,\r\nand we are limited to this period, enough is established in so far as\r\nthe argument of this work is concerned, and the rest may fairly be\r\nleft to be discussed and determined by the local antiquaries. All that\r\nit is necessary to contend for here is, that the alignments at Carnac\r\nare neither temples, nor tombs, nor town-halls, and that they were not\r\nerected before the time of the Romans. If these negative propositions\r\nare answered, there will not, probably, be much difficulty in admitting\r\nthat they must be trophies, and that the battle or campaign which they\r\ncommemorate was fought between the years 380 and 550 A.D.--in\r\nfact in the Arthurian age, to which we have ascribed most of those in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nThe monuments in the cemetery at Locmariaker are probably older, but\r\nsome of them extend down to the time when Carnac \"closed the line in\r\nglory.\"\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF DOLMENS IN THIRTY-ONE DEPARTMENTS OF FRANCE ACCORDING TO\r\nM.

That the Veneti\r\n    traded from the Côtes-du-Nord and the Morbihan to Cornwall and\r\n    the Cassiterides, no one, probably, will dispute. Their vessels,\r\n    according to Cæsar's account, were fully equal to carrying to\r\n    France all the metal this country could produce. The road by which\r\n    it reached Marseilles across France was always the difficulty. In\r\n    later times, the Celtic trade-route across France was apparently\r\n    up the Rhone, but on its left bank, and down the Seine, or on its\r\n    right bank; passing then through Celtica, but round the Aquitania\r\n    of Augustus, and reaching Britain through the country of the\r\n    Morini, which was the route Cæsar followed. This does not, however,\r\n    appear to have been the line which was taken by the trade in tin.\r\n    It followed, so far as we know, the central line of the dolmen\r\n    country; and the fact of one people and one language prevailing\r\n    throughout the whole of that region takes away any improbability,\r\n    and removes all the difficulties that have hitherto impeded the\r\n    adoption of that hypothesis.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 396: My intention was to have spent last autumn in\r\n    travelling through the southern departments of France with this\r\n    intent; but the war rendered the position of an exploring and\r\n    sketching foreigner so undesirable that I was forced to desist.

The original map, on\r\n    a scale of 440 feet to 1 inch, is still in Dr. Deane's possession,\r\n    at Bath, and is so valuable a record of what the monument was\r\n    thirty-two years ago that it is hoped it may be preserved by some\r\n    public body. Sir Henry Dryden and the Rev. Mr. Lukis have been\r\n    employed for some years past exploring and surveying in that\r\n    neighbourhood, and have brought back perfect plans, on a large\r\n    scale, of all the principal monuments; and if these were published,\r\n    they would leave little to be desired in that respect. Meanwhile\r\n    nothing can exceed Sir Henry's kindness and liberality in allowing\r\n    access to his treasures, and the use of them by any one who desires\r\n    it; and I am indebted to him for a great deal of the information\r\n    in this chapter. The general plans here published are from Messrs.\r\n    Blair and Ronalds' work, which is quite sufficiently correct for my\r\n    scale or my present purpose.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 415: The form of this enclosure, as will be seen from\r\n    the plan, is not an exact square, and some of the angle-stones\r\n    being removed, it is difficult now to ascertain its exact form.\r\n    Sir Henry Dryden makes it curvilinear. Messrs. Blair and Ronalds\r\n    make the east side quite straight; the south and west were slightly\r\n    curvilinear, but the whole figure is quadrangular; which is my own\r\n    impression of its form.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 416: Sir Henry Dryden counts ten rows.

When Ford published\r\nhis interesting and exhaustive 'Handbook of Spain,' in 1845, he had\r\ntravelled over the length and breadth of the land, and knew its\r\nliterature intimately, but he did not know that there was a single\r\n\"Druidical remain\" in the country. The first intimation of their\r\nexistence was in a pamphlet by Don Rafael Mitjana,[441] containing\r\nthe description of one at Antequera; and since then Don Gongora ý\r\nMartinez[442] has published a work containing views and descriptions of\r\nthirteen or fourteen important monuments of this class in Andalusia and\r\nthe south of Spain; and from other sources I know the names of at least\r\nan equal number in the Asturias and the north of Spain.[443] Had this\r\nwork consequently been written only a very few years ago, a description\r\nof the dolmen at Antequera must have begun and ended the chapter. As\r\nit now is, we not only know that dolmens are numerous in Spain, but\r\nwe have a distinct idea of their distribution, which may lead to most\r\nimportant historical results.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Portugal, the case is even more striking. Kinsey, in his\r\n'Portugal Illustrated,' in 1829, gave a drawing of a \"Druid's altar\"\r\nat Arroyolos, and it was mentioned also by Borrow,[444] but there our\r\ninformation stopped, till the meeting of the International Prehistoric\r\nCongress at Paris in 1867, when S. Pereira da Costa described by name\r\nthirty-nine dolmens as still existing in Portugal. He also mentioned\r\nthat as long ago as 1734 a memoir had been presented to the Portuguese\r\nAcademy enumerating 314 as then to be met with; and though this is\r\ndoubtful, it seems that they were at one time very numerous, and many,\r\nno doubt, still exist which have escaped S. da Costa's enquiries.\r\nNeither he nor any one else appears to have visited Cape Cuneus, the\r\nmost southern point of Portugal, where, if we read Strabo aright,\r\ndolmens certainly existed in his day;[445] and if they do so now, it\r\nwould be a point gained in our investigation.\r\n\r\nAt present, according to S. da Costa, there are twenty-one dolmens in\r\nAlentejo, two in Estramadura, nine in Beira, four in Tras os Montes,\r\nand three in Minho. According to my information, they are numerous in\r\nGallicia, but have never been described. Three at least are known by\r\nname in Santander, and as many in the Asturias. One at least is known\r\nin Biscay, and two in Vitoria; one in Navarre, and one in Catalonia.\r\nBut I am assured that all along the roots of the mountains they are\r\nfrequent, though no one has yet described or drawn them.[446] So far as\r\nis known, there are none in the Castiles, in the centre of Spain, and\r\nonly that group above alluded to in Andalusia, where probably, instead\r\nof a dozen, it may turn out that there are twice or thrice that number.\r\n\r\nAssuming this distribution of the Spanish dolmens to be correct--and\r\nI see no reason for doubting that it is so, in the main features at\r\nleast--it is so remarkable that it affords a good opportunity for\r\ntesting one of the principal theories put forward with regard to the\r\nmigrations of the dolmen-building people. According to the theory of M.\r\nBertrand, the dolmen people, after passing down the Baltic and leaving\r\ntheir monuments there, migrated to the British islands, and after a\r\nsojourn of some time again took to their ships and landed in France and\r\nSpain, to pass thence into Africa and disappear.[447] This seems so\r\nstrange, that it is fortunate we have another hypothesis which assumes\r\nthe probability of an indigenous population driven first to the hills\r\nand then into the ocean by the advancing tide of modern civilization.\r\n\r\nThe first hypothesis involves the assumption that the dolmen people\r\npossessed a navy capable of transplanting them and their families from\r\nshore to shore, and that they had a sufficient knowledge of geography\r\nto know exactly whither to go, but at the same time possessed with\r\nsuch a spirit of wandering that so soon as they settled for a certain\r\ntime in a given place, and buried a certain number of their chiefs,\r\nthey immediately set out again on their travels. According to this\r\nview, they were so weak that they fled the moment when the original\r\npossessors of the land rose against them, though, strange to say, they\r\nhad in the first instance been able to dispossess them. What is still\r\nmore unlikely is that they should have possessed the organization to\r\nkeep together, and to introduce everywhere their own arts and their\r\nown customs, but that, when they departed, they should have left\r\nnothing but their tombs behind. This hypothesis involves in fact so\r\nmany difficulties and so many improbabilities that I do not think that\r\neither M. Bertrand or the Baron de Bonstetten would now, that our\r\nknowledge is so much increased, adhere to it. I at least cannot see\r\non what grounds it can be maintained. It is so diametrically opposed\r\nto all we know of ancient migrations. They seem always--in so far as\r\nEurope is concerned--to have followed the course of the sun from east\r\nto west; and the idea that a people, after having peopled Britain,\r\nshould have started again to land on the rugged coasts of the Asturias\r\nor in Portugal, and not have been able to penetrate into the interior,\r\nis so very unlikely that it would require very strong and direct\r\ntestimony to make it credible, while it need hardly be said no such\r\nevidence is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis which seems to account much more satisfactorily for\r\nthe facts as we know them assumes that an ancestral worshipping\r\npeople inhabited the Spanish peninsula from remote prehistoric times.\r\nIf so, they certainly occupied the pastoral plains of Castile and\r\nthe fertile regions of Valencia and Andalusia, as well as the bleak\r\nhills of Gallicia and the Asturias. Whether we call them Iberians, or\r\nCeltiberians, or, to use a more general term, Turanians, they were\r\na dead-reverencing, ancestral worshipping people, but had not in\r\nprehistoric times learnt to use stone for the adornment of their tombs.\r\n\r\nThe first people, so far as we know, who disturbed the Iberians in\r\ntheir possessions were the Carthaginians. They occupied the sea coast\r\nat least of Murcia and Valencia, and if, according to their custom,\r\nthey sought to reduce the natives to slavery, they probably frightened\r\nmultitudes from the coast into the interior, but there is no proof that\r\nthey ever made any extensive settlements in the centre of the country,\r\nnor on its west or north coast. It was different with the Romans: with\r\nthem the genius of conquest was strong; they longed to annex all Spain\r\nto their dominions, and no doubt drove all those who were impatient\r\nof their yoke into the remote districts of Portugal and the rugged\r\nfastnesses of the Asturias and the northern mountains. It is also\r\nprobable that many, to avoid their oppressions, sought refuge beyond\r\nthe sea; but the great migrations are probably due to the intolerance\r\nof the early Christian missionaries. It thus seems that it was to avoid\r\nCarthaginian rapacity, Roman tyranny, and Christian intolerance, that\r\nthe unfortunate aborigines were forced first into the fastnesses of the\r\nhills, and thence driven literally into the sea, to seek refuge from\r\ntheir oppressors in the islands of the ocean.[448]\r\n\r\nSuch an hypothesis seems perfectly consonant with all the facts as we\r\nnow know them, and it also accounts for the absence of dolmens in the\r\ncentre of Spain; for if this is correct, these migrations took place\r\nin the pre-dolmen period, and just as we find the Bryts beginning to\r\nuse stones after having been driven from the fertile plains of the east\r\ninto the fastnesses of Cumberland and Wales, so we find the Spaniards\r\nfirst adopting rude-stone monuments after having been driven into\r\nPortugal and the Asturias.\r\n\r\nThe one point which this theory does not seem to account for is the\r\npresence of dolmens in Andalusia. They however are, if I am not\r\nmistaken, an outlying branch of the great African dolmen field, and\r\nbelong to the same age as these do, of which we shall be better able\r\nto judge presently. That there was a close or intimate connection\r\nfrom very early times between the south coast of Spain and the north\r\nof Africa hardly admits of a doubt. The facility with which the Moors\r\noccupied it in the seventh century, and the permanence of their\r\ndominion for so many centuries, is in itself sufficient to prove that\r\na people of the same race had been established there before them, and\r\nthat they were not a foreign race holding the natives in subjection,\r\nbut dwelling among their own kith and kin.\r\n\r\nIt seems in vain to look among the written annals, either of Spain\r\nor Ireland, for a rational account of these events. Both countries\r\nacknowledge to the fullest extent that the migration did take place;\r\nand the Spanish race of Heremon is one of the most illustrious of\r\nthose of Ireland, and fills a large page in its history. So, too, the\r\nSpanish annalists fill volumes with the successful expeditions of\r\ntheir countrymen to the Green Island.[449] The mania, however, of the\r\nannalists of both countries for carrying everything back to the Flood,\r\nand the sons and daughters of Noah, so vitiates everything they say,\r\nthat beyond the fact, which seems undoubted that such migration did\r\noccur no reliance can be placed on their accounts of these transactions.\r\n\r\nOne only paragraph that I know of seems to have escaped perversion. In\r\nhis second chapter of his fourth book, D. O'Campo states:--\"Certain\r\nnatives of Spain called Siloros (the Siluri), a Biscayan tribe, joined\r\nwith another, named Brigantes, migrated to Britain about 261 years\r\nbefore our era, and obtained possession of a territory there on which\r\nthey settled.\"[450] This is so consonant with what we know of the\r\nsettlement of the Silures on the banks of the Severn that there seems\r\nno good reason for doubting its correctness. It is more doubtful,\r\nhowever, whether any Spanish colonies reached Ireland at so early an\r\nage. Even allowing for the existence in the north-east of Ireland of\r\nthe realm of Emania, the only kingdom in Ireland of which we have any\r\nauthentic annals before the Christian era, there was plenty of room\r\nfor the contemporary existence of the race of Heremon in the south and\r\nwest. Tara did not then exist, and, in fact, according to the annals\r\nof the 'Four Masters,' was founded by Heremon himself, and took its\r\nfirst name, Teamair, from Tea, his wife, who selected this spot. All\r\nthis is perfectly consistent with what we know of the history of the\r\nplace. The earliest monument at Tara is the Rath of Cormac[451] (218\r\nA.D., or probably fifty years later). Though therefore chosen\r\nby Heremon as a sacred or desirable spot for residence, there is no\r\nproof that his race ever occupied it; and in the two centuries that\r\nelapsed from his advent to the time of Cormac his race had passed away\r\nfrom Meath at least, and was only to be found in the south and west of\r\nIreland. The one reminiscence of the Milesian race that remained at\r\nTara, in historical times, is the Lia Fail, or Stone of Destiny, which\r\nthese \"veneratores lapidum\" are said to have brought with them from\r\nSpain, but which, with all due deference to Petrie, is not the obelisk\r\nstill standing there,[452] but may be the stone now in Westminster\r\nAbbey. The Spanish colonists seem principally to have occupied the\r\ncountry about Wexford and Galway,[453] and to these places, especially\r\nthe latter, a continual stream of immigration appears to have flowed\r\nfrom the first century of our era down to the time of Elizabeth. No\r\none can travel in these counties without remarking the presence of a\r\ndark-haired, dark-eyed race that prevails everywhere; but, strange to\r\nsay, the darkest-complexioned people in the west are those who still\r\nlinger among the long-neglected dolmens of Glen Malim More.\r\n\r\nAccording to the annals of the 'Four Masters,' Heremon landed in\r\nIreland fifty years after the death of the great Dagdha. The Irish\r\nhistorians say that the country was then ruled by three princesses,\r\nwives of the grandsons of the Dagdha, and add that the event took\r\nplace 1002 years after Forann (Pharaoh) had been drowned in the Red\r\nSea.[454] If that event took place in 1312, as I believe it did,[455]\r\nthis would fix their advent in 310 B.C., which, though less\r\nextravagant than the chronology of the 'Four Masters, is still, I\r\nbelieve, at least three centuries too early. All this may not be--is\r\nnot in fact--capable of absolute proof; but it has at least the merit\r\nthat it pieces together satisfactorily all we know of the history and\r\nethnography of these races, and explains in a reasonable manner all the\r\narchitectural forms which we meet with. It is hardly fair to expect\r\nmore from the annals of a rude people who could not write, and whose\r\nhistory has never been carefully investigated in modern times. It is\r\ntoo early yet to say so, but the fact is, that it is these rude-stone\r\nmonuments which alone can reveal the secrets of their long forgotten\r\npast. As they have hitherto been treated, they have only added mystery\r\nto obscurity. But the time is not far off when this will be altered,\r\nand we may learn from a comparison of the Irish with Spanish dolmens,\r\nnot only what truth there is in the migrations of Heremon, but also at\r\nwhat time these Spanish tribes first settled as colonists in the Irish\r\nisle.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOLMENS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 155. View of the Interior of Dolmen at Antequera. From\r\nMitjana.]\r\n\r\nThe finest dolmen known to exist in Spain is that of Antequera, above\r\nalluded to; it will, indeed, bear comparison with the best in France\r\nor any other country in Europe. The chamber is of a somewhat oval\r\nshape, and measures internally about 80 feet from the entrance to the\r\nfront of the stone closing the rear. Its greatest width is 20 feet 6\r\ninches, and its height varies between 9 and 10 feet.[456] The whole is\r\ncomposed of thirty-one stones: ten on each side form the walls; one\r\ncloses the end; five are roofing, and three pillars support the last\r\nat their junction. The stone forming the roof of the cell or innermost\r\npart measures 25 feet by 21 feet, and is of considerable thickness. All\r\nthe stones comprising this monument are more or less shaped by art--at\r\nleast to the extent to which those at Stonehenge can be said to be\r\nso; while the three pillars in the centre, which seem to be part of\r\nthe original structure, are certainly hewn. The whole was originally\r\ncovered with a mound about 100 feet in diameter, and is still partially\r\nat least so buried. Its entrance is, however, and probably always was,\r\nflush with the edge of the mound, and open and accessible, and it is\r\nconsequently not to be wondered at if nothing was found inside to\r\nindicate its age or use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 156. Plan of Dolmen called Cueva de Menga, near\r\nAntequera.]\r\n\r\nIf we might assume--there is no proof--that the mound at Antequera was\r\noriginally surrounded by a circle of stones like those at Lough Crew\r\n(woodcut No. 72), we should have a monument whose plan and dimensions\r\nwere the same as those of Stonehenge, and, _mutatis mutandis_, the two\r\nwould be, as nearly as may be, identical. There is the same circle\r\nof stone or earth 100 feet in diameter, and the same elliptical\r\nchoir 80 feet in length, assuming that of Stonehenge to be extended\r\nto the outer circle. Antequera is, in fact, a roofed and covered-up\r\nStonehenge, Stonehenge a free-standing Antequera. If both were situated\r\nin Wiltshire or in Andalusia, I should unhesitatingly declare for\r\nAntequera being the older. Men do what is useful before they indulge\r\nin what is merely fanciful. The two, in fact, bear exactly the same\r\nrelation to one another that Callernish does to New Grange; but when so\r\nwidely separated geographically as the former two are, and belonging to\r\ntwo different races, it is difficult to say which may be the older. All\r\nwe can feel sure of is that both belong to the same system, and that\r\nthey are not far removed from each other in date. We must, however,\r\nknow more than we do of the local history of Spanish dolmens before we\r\ncan feel sure that Antequera may not be even considerably more modern\r\nthan Stonehenge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 157. Dolmen del Tio Cogolleros. From Gongora.]\r\n\r\nNone of the other dolmens in Andalusia approach Antequera in\r\nmagnificence, though they all seem to bear a similar character, and in\r\nappearance belong to the same age. The supporting stones seem to be all\r\nmore or less shaped by art, and fitted to some extent to one another.\r\nThe cap-stone is generally left in its natural state, largeness being\r\nthe feature that the builders always aimed at. These peculiarities are\r\nwell exhibited in the dolmen called de la Cruz del Tio Cogolleros,\r\nin the parish of Fonelas, near Guadix. Here the cap-stone measures\r\nnearly 12 feet each way, and covers what was intended to be a nearly\r\nsquare chamber; one side, as at Kit's Cotty House, being left open;\r\nconsequently it could hardly ever have been intended to be covered with\r\na mound. Indeed, so far as we can gather from Don Gongora's drawings,\r\nnone of those which he illustrates were ever so buried, nor does it\r\nappear that it was originally the intention ever to cover them with\r\nearth. Another monument, called only Sepultura Grande, in the parish\r\nof Gor, in the same neighbourhood, is interesting from its resemblance\r\nto the Swedish sepulchre illustrated in woodcut No. 108, and to the\r\nCountless Stones at Aylesford. Its cap-stone is 12 feet by 8 feet, and\r\nthe side-stones fall away to a point in front. It evidently never was\r\nintended to be further roofed, nor to be buried in a mound, and, so far\r\nas can be judged from its appearance, is of comparatively modern date.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of Don Gongora's plates is one representing\r\na dolmen near Dilar. This, if the drawing is to be depended upon,\r\nconsists of a monolithic chamber, hollowed out of a stone of\r\nconsiderable dimensions, and hewn so as almost to look like an Egyptian\r\ncell. It is surrounded by twelve or fourteen rude-stone pillars,\r\napparently 3 feet in height, and like those of Callernish in shape.\r\nIn the distance are seen two other circles of rude stones, but with\r\nnothing in their centre. If I understand Don Gongora rightly, these\r\nmonuments are now very much ruined, if not entirely destroyed, and it\r\nis not clear how far the drawings are actual sketches or restorations.\r\nThey may be correct, but without further confirmation it would hardly\r\nbe safe to found any argument upon them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 158. Sepultura Grande. From Gongora.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo little is known--or at least so little has been published--regarding\r\nthe dolmens of the north of Spain that it is very difficult and very\r\nunsafe to attempt any generalisation regarding them. There are three,\r\nhowever, which do seem to throw some light on our enquiries. The first\r\nis at Eguilar, in the district of Vitoria, on the road between that\r\ncity and Pampeluna. It is of a horse-shoe form, like the Countless\r\nStones at Aylesford, and measures 13 feet by 10 feet internally.\r\nOriginally it was roofed by a single stone, measuring 19 feet by 15\r\nfeet, but which is now, unfortunately, broken. The side-stones and roof\r\nare closely fitted to one another, showing that it was always intended\r\nto be, and, in fact, is now, partially covered by a mound of earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 159. Plan of Dolmen at Eguilar.]\r\n\r\nAt Cangas de Onis, in the Asturias, about forty miles east from Oviedo,\r\nthere is a small church built on a mound which contains in it a dolmen\r\nof rather unusual shape. Its inner end is circular in plan, from which\r\nproceeds a funnel-shaped nave, formed of three stones on each side,\r\nand with a doorway formed by two large stones at right angles to its\r\ndirection. On the top of the mound a church was built, probably in\r\nthe tenth or eleventh century,[457] to which this dolmen served as a\r\ncrypt. From this it seems to be a fair inference that, when the church\r\nwas built on the mound, the dolmen was still a sacred edifice of the\r\naborigines. Had the Christians merely wanted a foundation for their\r\nbuilding, they would have filled up or destroyed the pagan edifice, but\r\nit seems to have remained open to the present day; and though it has\r\nlong ceased to be used for any sacred purpose, it still is, and always\r\nwas, an essential part of the church which it supported.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 160. Plan of Dolmen at Cangas de Onis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 161. Dolmen of San Miguel, at Arrichinaga.]\r\n\r\nA still more remarkable instance of the same kind is to be found at\r\na place called Arrichinaga, about twenty-five miles from Bilboa, in\r\nthe province of Biscay. In the hermitage of St. Michael, at this\r\nplace, a dolmen of very considerable dimensions is enclosed within\r\nthe walls of what seems to be a new modern church. It may, however,\r\nbe the successor of one more ancient; but the fact of these great\r\nstones being adopted by the Christians at all shows that they must have\r\nbeen considered sacred and objects of worship by the natives at the\r\ntime when the Christians enclosed them in their edifice. If the facts\r\nare as represented in the woodcut,[458] we can now easily understand\r\nwhy the councils of Toledo, in 681 and 692, fulminated their decrees\r\nagainst the \"veneratores lapidum;\"[459] and why also the more astute\r\nprovincial priesthood followed the advice that Pope Gregory gave to\r\nAbbot Millitus, and by means of a little holy water and an image of\r\nSan Miguel turned the sacred stones of the pagans into a temple of the\r\ntrue God. It is difficult to say when Christianity penetrated into\r\nthe Asturias--not, probably, before the time of Pelayo (A.D.\r\n720); but even this would be too early for such churches as those of\r\nCangas de Onis and Arrichinaga. They, in fact, seem to carry down the\r\nveneration for big stones to almost as late a date as the age indicated\r\nby the dolmen at Confolens (woodcut No. 123), and bring the probable\r\nerection of some of them at least, if not of all, within the historic\r\nera.\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTUGAL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 162. Dolmen at Arroyolos. From Kinsey.]\r\n\r\nOnly one drawing of a dolmen in Portugal has as yet, so far as I know,\r\nbeen published. It is situated on a bleak heath-land at Arroyolos, not\r\nfar from Evora. Mr. Borrow describes it as one of the most perfect and\r\nbeautiful of its kind he had ever seen. \"It was circular, and consisted\r\nof stones immensely large and heavy at the bottom, which towards\r\nthe top became thinner, having been fashioned by the hand of art to\r\nsomething like the shape of scallop-shells. These were surmounted by\r\na very large flat stone, which slanted down towards the south, where\r\nwas a door. Three or four individuals might have taken shelter within\r\nthe interior, in which was growing a small thorn-tree.\"[460] Neither\r\nhe nor Kinsey condescend to dimensions, and S. da Costa merely remarks\r\nthat the dolmens which he has seen at Castello da Vide are of a similar\r\nconstruction to this one at Arroyolos.[461]\r\n\r\nThis, it must be confessed, is but a meagre and imperfect outline of\r\none of the most important dolmen-fields in Europe, but it is probably\r\nsufficient to indicate its importance and its bearing on the history\r\nof megalithic remains in general. When filled up, it promises to throw\r\na flood of light on the subject in general, not only from being one of\r\nthe connecting links serving to join the African dolmen-field to that\r\nof Europe, but more especially from the assistance it seems to afford\r\nus in understanding the hitherto mysterious connection of the Irish\r\nMilesians with Spain. If the dolmens on the north and west coasts of\r\nthe Spanish peninsula were carefully examined and compared with those\r\nin Ireland, their similarity would probably suffice to prove their\r\naffinity, and to establish on a broad basis of fact what has hitherto\r\nbeen left to the wild imaginings of patriotic annalists, more anxious\r\nfor the fabled antiquity of their race than for the prosaic results of\r\ntruthful investigations.\r\n\r\nFrom such knowledge as we at present possess, I see no reason for\r\nsupposing that any of the Spanish dolmens are as old as the Christian\r\nera; and the facts connected with the two at Cangas de Onis and\r\nArrichinaga seem to prove that they were \"venerated\" as late at least\r\nas the eighth, it may be the tenth, century, and, if venerated, there\r\nis no reason why they should not also have been erected at that late\r\nage.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\nAlthough the experience we have just acquired with reference to dolmens\r\nin Spain ought to make any one cautious as to making assertions\r\nregarding those in Italy, still it probably is safe to assert that,\r\nwith the exception of one group at Saturnia, there are no dolmens in\r\nthat country. In many respects Italy is very differently situated from\r\nSpain. Her own learned societies and antiquaries have for centuries\r\nbeen occupied with her antiquities, and foreign tourists have traversed\r\nthe length and breadth of the land, and could hardly have failed to\r\nremark anything that called to their recollection the Druids or Dragons\r\nof their own native lands. As nothing, however, of the sort has been\r\nrecorded, we may feel tolerable confidence that no important specimens\r\nexist; though at the roots of the hills and in remote corners there can\r\nbe little doubt that waifs and strays of wandering races will reward\r\nthe careful searcher for such objects. One, for instance, is known to\r\nexist near Sesto Calende, in Lombardy. It is a circle of small stones,\r\nsome 30 feet in diameter, with an avenue 50 feet in length touching\r\nit tangentially on one side, and with a small semicircle of stones 20\r\nfeet wide a few yards farther off.[462] The whole looks like the small\r\nalignments on Dartmoor, and if several were found and the traditions of\r\nthe country were carefully sifted, this might lead to some light being\r\nthrown on the subject. At present it is hardly much bigger or more\r\ninteresting than a sheep-fold.\r\n\r\nThe Saturnia group is thus described by Mr. Dennis:--\"They are very\r\nnumerous, consisting generally of a quadrangular chamber sunk a few\r\nfeet below the surface, lined with rough slabs of rock set upright,\r\none on each side, and roofed over with two large slabs resting against\r\neach other, so as to form a penthouse, or else a single one of enormous\r\nsize, covering the whole, and laid with a slight slope, apparently for\r\nthe purpose of carrying off the rain. Not a chisel has touched these\r\nrugged masses, about 16 feet square to half that size; some divided,\r\nlike that shown in the annexed woodcut, into two chambers over 18 feet\r\nacross. To most of them a passage leads, 10 or 12 feet long and 3 feet\r\nwide. All are sunk a little below the surface, because each had a\r\ntumulus of earth piled around it, so as to cover all but the cap stone.\"\r\n\r\nOne tumulus was observed with a circle of small stones set round it,\r\nand Mr. Dennis suggests \"that all may have been so encircled, but that\r\nthe small stones would be easily removed by the peasantry.\" \"Nothing,\"\r\nhe adds, \"at all like them is seen in any other part of Etruria.\"[463]\r\nSaturnia is situated twenty miles from the sea, and if it is true that\r\nnothing of the sort is found elsewhere in Italy, these dolmens must\r\nbe looked upon as exceptional--the remains of some stray colony of\r\ndolmen-builders, the memory of which has passed away, and may probably\r\nnow be lost for ever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 163. Dolmen at Saturnia. From Dennis' 'Etruria.']\r\n\r\nIf this is a correct representation of what took place in Italy,\r\nthe conclusion seems inevitable that the chambered tumuli of that\r\ncountry--all of which are erected with hewn stones--did not grow out\r\nof rude-stone monuments. In no country in Europe are the tumuli so\r\nnumerous or so important as in Etruria, and, as before mentioned, they\r\ncertainly extend back to an era twelve or thirteen centuries before\r\nChrist. But if the dolmens of France or Scandinavia are prehistoric,\r\nor, in other words, extend back to anything like a thousand or fifteen\r\nhundred years before Christ, there is no reason whatever why dolmens\r\nshould not be found also in Italy, if they ever existed there. Either\r\nit must be that Italy never possessed any or that those in the rest of\r\nEurope are very much more modern. If the northern dolmens are only one\r\nthousand to two thousand years old, the matter is easily explained. If\r\nthey are three thousand or four thousand years old, they ought also to\r\nbe found in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe fact seems to be that both the Pelasgi of Greece and the Tyrrheni\r\nof Italy came in contact either with Egypt or some early stone-hewing\r\npeople before they left their homes in the East to migrate into Europe,\r\nand that they never passed through the rude-stone stage of architecture\r\nat any period, or at any place with which we are acquainted; and as\r\nthey were, so far as we know, the earliest colonists of the countries\r\nthey afterwards occupied, it seems in vain to look for dolmens where\r\nthey settled. If Attila had lived five centuries before instead\r\nof after the Christian era, he and his Huns might have produced a\r\nrude-stone age in Italy. The inhabitants of Etruria were essentially a\r\nburying, dead-reverencing people, and if they had only been thrown back\r\nto that stage of barbarism which the rude monuments of our forefathers\r\nrepresent, we might have found dolmens there in thousands. The fate\r\nof Italy was different. Pressed by the Celts of Gallia Cisalpina\r\nin the north and by the Romans in the south, Etruria was squeezed\r\nout of existence, but by two races more civilized and progressive\r\nthan herself. So far from throwing her back towards barbarism, Rome\r\nin adopting many of her forms advanced and improved upon them, and\r\nimparted to her architecture a higher and more intellectual form than\r\nshe had been herself able to impress upon it. So, too, in Greece. The\r\nDorian superseded and extinguished the Pelasgic forms, but after a\r\nlonger interval of time. Four or five centuries elapsed between the\r\nlast tomb we know of, at Mycenæ, and the earliest Doric temple at\r\nCorinth, and the consequence is that we see far fewer traces of the\r\nearlier people in the architecture of Greece than we do in that of\r\nRome. But in neither instance was there any tendency to retrograde to a\r\ndolmen stage of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe case was widely different with such countries as Spain or France.\r\nThere an aboriginal population had existed for thousands and tens of\r\nthousands of years, unprogressive and incapable, so far as we know, of\r\nprogress within themselves, and only at last slowly and reluctantly\r\nforced by Roman example to adopt a more ambitious mode of sepulture\r\nthan a mere mound of earth. No semi-civilized race ever settled in\r\ntheir lands, and the Carthaginians at Carthagena or Marseilles hardly\r\npenetrated into the interior, and were besides neither a building nor\r\nburying race, and had, consequently, very little influence on their\r\nmodes of sepulture.\r\n\r\nWith Rome the case was different. She conquered and administered for\r\ncenturies all those countries in which we find the earliest traces\r\nof rude-stone monuments, and she could hardly fail to leave some\r\nimpress of her magnificence in lands which she had so long occupied.\r\nBut when she withdrew her protecting care, France, Spain, and Britain\r\nrelapsed into, and for centuries remained sunk in, a state of anarchy\r\nand barbarism as bad, if not worse than, that in which Rome had found\r\nthem three or four centuries before. It was in vain to expect that the\r\nhapless natives could maintain either the arts or the institutions\r\nwith which Rome had endowed them. But it is natural to suppose that\r\nthey would remember the evidences of her greatness and her power, and\r\nwould hardly go back for their sepulchres to the unchambered mole-hill\r\nbarrows of their forefathers, but attempt something in stone, though\r\nonly in such rude fashion as the state of the arts among them enabled\r\nthem to execute.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 441: 'Memoria sobre el Tempio Druida de Antequera,'\r\n    Malaga, 1847.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 442: 'Antegüedades prehistoricos de Andalucia,' Madrid,\r\n    1868.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 443: For a great part of the information regarding them,\r\n    I am indebted to my friend Don J.

Though hundreds of travellers had passed through\r\nthe country since the time of Bruce and Shaw, and though the French\r\nhad possessed Algiers since 1830, an author writing on the subject ten\r\nyears ago would have been fully justified in making the assertion that\r\nthere were no dolmens there. Yet now we know that they exist literally\r\nin thousands. Perhaps it would not be an exaggeration to say that ten\r\nthousand are known, and their existence recorded.\r\n\r\nThe first to announce the fact to the literary world in Europe was\r\nthe late Mr. Rhind. He read a paper on what he called \"Ortholithic\r\nremains in North Africa,\" to the Society of Antiquaries in 1859, which\r\nwas afterwards published in volume xxxviii. of the 'Archæologia.' It\r\nattracted, however, very little attention, perhaps in consequence of\r\nits name, but more from its not being illustrated. It was not really\r\ntill 1863, when the late Henry Christy visited Algeria, that anything\r\nreally became known. At Constantine he formed the acquaintance of a M.\r\nFéraud, interpreter to the army of Algeria, who took him to a place\r\ncalled Bou Moursug, about twenty-five miles south of Constantine,\r\nwhere, during a short stay of three days, they saw and noted down\r\nupwards of one thousand dolmens.[464] M. Féraud afterwards published\r\nan account of these in the 'Mémoires de la Société archéologique\r\nde Constantine' for 1863, and the subject having attracted some\r\nattention in Europe, a second memoir appeared in the following year,\r\nwhich contained a good deal of additional information collected from\r\ndifferent district officers. Since then various memoirs have been\r\npublished in Algeria and France. One by the now celebrated General\r\nFaidherbe \"speaks of three thousand tombs in the single necropolis\r\nat Roknia, and of another equally extensive within a few leagues of\r\nConstantine.\"[465] An excellent _résumé_ of the whole subject will be\r\nfound in the Norwich volume of the International Prehistoric Congress,\r\nby Mr. Flower. From all these we gather a fair general idea of the\r\nsubject, but, unfortunately, none of the memoirs are written by persons\r\ncombining extensive local experience with real archæological knowledge,\r\nexcept, perhaps, Mr. Flower. No plan of any one group has yet been\r\ngiven to the world, nor are any of the monuments illustrated with such\r\ndetails and measurements as would enable one to speak with certainty\r\nregarding them. This is especially the case with those represented\r\nin the 'Exploration scientifique de l'Algérie,' published by the\r\nFrench Government. There are in this work numerous representations of\r\ndolmens carefully and beautifully drawn, but very seldom with scales\r\nattached to them; and as no text has yet been published, they are\r\nof comparatively little value for the purposes of research. Had Mr.\r\nChristy lived a little longer, these deficiencies would doubtless have\r\nbeen supplied; but, unfortunately, his mantle has not fallen on any\r\nworthy successor, and we must wait till some one appears who combines\r\nleisure and means with the knowledge and enthusiasm which characterized\r\nthat noble-minded man.\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be added that no detailed map exists showing the\r\ndistribution of the dolmens in Algeria,[466] and as many of the names\r\nby which they are known to French archæologists are those of villages\r\nnot marked on any maps obtainable in this country, it is very difficult\r\nto trace their precise position, and almost always impossible to draw\r\nwith certainty any inferences from their distribution. In so far as\r\nwe at present know, the principal dolmen region is situated along and\r\non either side of a line drawn from Bona on the coast to Batna, sixty\r\nmiles south of Constantine. But around Setif, and in localities nearly\r\ndue south from Boujie, they are said to be in enormous numbers. The\r\nCommandant Payen reports the number of menhirs there as not less than\r\nten thousand, averaging from 4 to 5 feet in height. One colossal\r\nmonolith he describes as 26 feet in diameter at its base and 52 feet\r\nhigh.[467] This, however, is surpassed by a dolmen situated near\r\nTiaret, described by the Commandant Bernard. According to his account\r\nthe cap-stone is 65 feet long by 26 feet broad, and 9 feet 6 inches\r\nthick; and this enormous mass is placed on other rocks which rise\r\nbetween 30 and 40 feet above the surface.[468] If this is true, it is\r\nthe most enormous dolmen known, and it is strange that it should have\r\nescaped observation so long. Even the most apathetic traveller might\r\nhave been astonished at such a wonder. Whether less gigantic specimens\r\nof the class exist in that neighbourhood, we are not told, but they do\r\nin detached patches everywhere eastward throughout the province. Those\r\ndescribed by Mr. Rhind are only twelve miles from Algiers, and others\r\nare said to exist in great numbers in the regency of Tripoli.[469] So\r\nfar as is at present known, they are not found in Morocco, but are\r\nfound everywhere between Mount Atlas and the Syrtes, and apparently not\r\nnear the sites of any great cities, or known centres of population,\r\nbut in valleys and remote corners, as if belonging to a nomadic or\r\nagricultural population.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 164. Bazina. From Flower's Paper.]\r\n\r\nWhen we speak of the ten thousand or, it may be, twenty thousand stone\r\nsepulchral monuments that are now known to exist in northern Africa,\r\nit must not be understood that they are all dolmens or circles of\r\nthe class of which we have hitherto been speaking. Two other classes\r\ncertainly exist, in some places, apparently, in considerable numbers,\r\nthough it is difficult to make out in what proportion, and how far\r\ntheir forms are local. One of these classes, called Bazina by the\r\nArabs, is thus described by Mr. Flower:--\"Their general character is\r\nthat of three concentric enclosures of stones of greater or less\r\ndimensions, so arranged as to form a series of steps. Sometimes,\r\nindeed, there are only two outer circles, and occasionally only one.\r\nThe diameter of the larger axis of that here represented is about 30\r\nfeet. In the centre are usually found three long and slender upright\r\nstones, forming three sides of a long rectangle, and the interior is\r\npaved with pebbles and broken stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 165. Choucha. From a drawing by Mr. Flower.]\r\n\r\n\"The Chouchas are found in the neighbourhood of the Bazinas, and are\r\nclosely allied to them. They consist of courses of stones regularly\r\nbuilt up like a wall, and not in steps like the Bazinas. Their diameter\r\nvaries from 7 to as much as 40 feet; but the height of the highest\r\nabove the soil does not exceed 5 to 10 feet. They are usually capped\r\nand covered by a large flag-stone, about 4 inches thick, under which\r\nis a regular trough or pit formed of stones from a foot and a half\r\nto 3 feet in thickness. The interior of these little towers is paved\r\nlike the Bazinas; and indeed M. Payen considers that they are the\r\nequivalents in the mountains of the Bazinas in the plains.\"[470]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 166. Dolmen on Steps. From 'Exploration scientifique de\r\nl'Algérie.']\r\n\r\nIn many instances the chouchas and bazinas are found combined in one\r\nmonument, and sometimes a regular dolmen is mounted on steps similar\r\nto those of a bazina, as shown in the annexed woodcut, representing\r\none existing halfway between Constantine and Bona. But, in fact,\r\nthere is no conceivable combination which does not seem to be found in\r\nthese African cemeteries; and did we know them all, they might throw\r\nconsiderable light on some questions that are now very perplexing.\r\n\r\nThe chouchas are found sometimes isolated, and occasionally 10 to\r\n12 feet apart from one another in groups. In certain localities the\r\nsummits and ridges of the hills are covered with them, while on the\r\nedges of steep cliffs they form fringes overhanging the ravines.\r\n\r\nIn both these classes of monuments the bodies are almost always found\r\nin a doubled-up posture, the knees being brought up to the chin, and\r\nthe arms crossed over the breast,[471] like those in the Axevalla tomb\r\ndescribed above (page 312).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 167. Tumuli, with Intermediate Lines of Stones.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 168. Group of Sepulchral Monuments, Algeria.]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable peculiarity of the tumuli and circles in Algeria\r\nis the mode in which they are connected together by double lines of\r\nstones--as Mr. Flowers expresses it, like beads on a string--in the\r\nmanner shown in woodcut No. 167. What the object of this was has not\r\nbeen explained, nor will it be easy to guess, till we have more,\r\nand more detailed, drawings than we now possess. Mr. Féraud's plate\r\nxxviii.[472] shows such a line zigzagging across the plain between\r\ntwo heights, like a line of field fortifications, and with dolmens\r\nand tumuli sometimes behind or in front of the lines, and at others\r\nstrung upon it. At first sight it looks like the representation of\r\na battle-field, but, again, what are we to make of such a group as\r\nthat represented in woodcut 168 on the previous page? It is the most\r\nextensive plan of any one of these groups which has yet been published,\r\nbut it must be received with caution.[473] There is no scale attached\r\nto it. The triple circles with dolmens I take to be tumuli, like\r\nthose of the Aveyron (woodcuts Nos. 8 and 122), but the whole must be\r\nregarded as a diagram, not as a plan, and as such very unsafe to reason\r\nupon. Still, as it certainly is not invented, it shows the curious\r\nmanner in which these monuments are joined together, as well as the\r\nvarious forms which they take.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 169. Plan and Elevation of African Tumulus. From Féraud.]\r\n\r\nOne of these (?) is represented in plan and elevation in the annexed\r\nwoodcut 169.[474] It is, as will be observed, almost identical--\r\nmaking allowance for bad drawing--with those of Aveyron just referred\r\nto, or with the Scandinavian examples as exemplified in the diagram\r\n(woodcut No. 109). As this class with the external dolmen on the\r\nsummit seems to be very extensive in Algeria, indeed almost typical,\r\nan examination of their interior would at once solve the mystery of\r\ntheir arrangements, and tell us whether there was a second cist on the\r\nground level, or where the body was deposited. Where the dolmen stands\r\nfree, but on the flat ground, as is the case with that shown in this\r\ncut (No. 170), with two rows of stones surrounding it, the body was\r\ndeposited in a cist formed between the two uprights that support the\r\ncap-stone, which are carried down some 5 or 6 feet into the ground for\r\nthat purpose. My impression is that the same arrangement is met with in\r\nthose which are raised, and that either the supports of the cap-stone\r\nare carried down to the ground for that purpose or that an independent\r\ncist, is formed directly under the visible one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 170. Dolmen with Two Circles of Stones. From Féraud.]\r\n\r\nThe dolmen in this last instance is of the usual Kit's Cotty House\r\nstyle, consisting of three upright stones supporting the cap-stone.\r\nSometimes the outer row of stones is replaced by a circular pavement\r\nof flat stones,[475] forming what may be supposed to be a procession\r\npath round the monument; but in fact hardly any two are exactly alike,\r\nand when we come to deal with thousands, it requires very complete\r\nknowledge of the whole before any classification can be attempted.\r\nSuffice it to say here that there is hardly any variety met with\r\nelsewhere of which a counterpart cannot be found in Algeria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 171. Dolmens on the Road from Bona to Constantine. From\r\n'Exploration scientifique de l'Algérie.']\r\n\r\nOf their general appearance as objects in the landscape, the annexed\r\nwoodcut will convey a tolerable idea. They seem to affect the ridges\r\nof the hills, but they also stretch across the plain, and in fact are\r\nfound everywhere and in every possible position. Except apparently on\r\nthe sea-coast, nothing like the Viking graves, so far as is known, is\r\nfound in Algeria; whether this indicates that they were a sea-faring\r\npeople or not is not quite clear, but it is a distinction worth bearing\r\nin mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 172. Four Cairns enclosed in Squares. (From 'Soc. arch.\r\nde Constantine,' 1864.)]\r\n\r\nOne curious group is perhaps worth quoting as a means of comparison\r\nwith the graves of Aschenrade (woodcut No. 119). It consists of four\r\ntumuli enclosed in four squares joined together like the squares of\r\na chess-board. Single squares enclosing cairns are common enough in\r\nScandinavia, but this conjoined arrangement is rare and remarkable,\r\nand its similarity to the Livonian example is so great that it can\r\nhardly be accidental. The Aschenrade graves, it will be recollected,\r\ncontained coins of the Caliphs extending down to A.D. 999,\r\nand German coins down to 1040. There would, therefore, be no _à\r\npriori_ improbability in these graves in Algeria being as late, if the\r\nsimilarity of two monuments so far apart can be considered as proving\r\nidentity of age. Without unduly pressing the argument, the points of\r\nresemblance which exist everywhere between the Northern Europe and\r\nNorth African monuments appear to prove that the latter may be of any\r\nage down to the tenth or eleventh century, but any decision as to\r\ntheir real date must depend on the local circumstances attending each\r\nindividual example.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe preceding woodcuts are perhaps sufficient to explain the more\r\ngeneral and more typical forms of Algerian dolmens, but they are so\r\nnumerous and so varied that ten times that number of illustrations\r\nwould hardly suffice to exhibit all their peculiarities. Their study,\r\nhowever, is comparatively uninteresting, till we know more of their\r\ncontents, and till something definite is accepted as to their age.\r\nWhen, however, we turn to examine that, we find the data from which\r\nour conclusions must be drawn both meagre and unsatisfactory. Such as\r\nthey are, however, they certainly all tend one way. In the first place,\r\nthe negative evidence is as complete here as elsewhere. The Greeks,\r\nthe Romans, and the early Christians were all familiar with northern\r\nAfrica, and there is not one whisper as to any such monuments having\r\nbeen seen by any of them. When we consider our own ignorance of their\r\nexistence till some ten years ago, it may be said that such evidence\r\ndoes not go for much; but it is worth alluding to, as a hint in the\r\nopposite direction would be considered final, and as its absence,\r\nat all events, leaves the question open. On the other hand, all the\r\ntraditions of the country as reported by M. Féraud, and others, and\r\nrepeated by M. Bertrand and Mr. Flower, ascribe these monuments to\r\nthe pagan inhabitants who occupied the country at the time of the\r\nMahommedan conquest. Thus (page 127): \"At the epoch the Mussulman\r\ninvasion these countries were inhabited by a pagan population, who\r\nelevated these vast ranges of stone to arrest the invading host.\" Or,\r\nagain, they even name the prince who opposed the conquerors. Thus\r\n(page 117): \"Formerly at Machira lived a pagan prince called Abd en\r\nNar--fire worshipper. He married Zana, queen of a city now in ruins\r\nbearing that name. When the Arabs conquered Africa, Abd en Nar abjured\r\nhis crown, became a Mussulman, and from that time called himself Abd en\r\nNour--worshipper of the light.\"[476]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 173. Tombs near Djidjeli. From 'Exploration scientifique\r\nde l'Algérie.']\r\n\r\nThis, too, must be taken for what it is worth; but in a cemetery\r\nnear Djidjeli, on the north coast, there is a curious tomb formed of\r\na circle of stones like those of the pagan cists, with a head-stone\r\nwhich, if it is not the turban-stone that is usually found in Turkish\r\ntombs of modern date, is most singularly like it. That the cemetery\r\nbelongs to the Mahommedans seems clear, but the circles of stones,\r\nthough small, indicate a very imperfect conversion--just such as the\r\ntradition indicates.\r\n\r\nThese arguments, however, acquire something like consistency when we\r\ncome to examine the contents of the tombs themselves. One of them (No.\r\n4) is described by Mr. Féraud as surrounded by a circular enceinte, 12\r\nmetres, nearly 40 feet, in diameter. The chamber of the dolmen measured\r\n7 feet by 3 feet 6 inches. At the feet of the skeleton were the bones\r\nand teeth of a horse, and an iron bridle-bit. In the same grave were\r\nfound a ring of iron, another ring with various other objects in\r\ncopper (bronze?), some fragments of pottery of a superior quality,\r\nand fragments of worked flint implements, and lastly a medal of the\r\nEmpress Faustina.[477] All the three ages were consequently represented\r\nin the one tomb, and yet it certainly belongs to the second century.\r\nNone of the others give such distinct evidence of their age, but M.\r\nBertrand, who is a strong advocate for the prehistoric age of French\r\ndolmens, sums up his impressions of M. Féraud's discoveries in the\r\nfollowing words: \"Ceux de la province de Constantine ne pouvaient, à en\r\njuger par les objets qui y out été trouvés, être de beaucoup antérieur\r\nà l'ère chrétienne; quelques-uns même seraient postérieurs.\"[478]\r\n\r\nIn addition to what he found inside the tombs, M. Féraud discovered a\r\nLatin inscription in the cap-stone of a dolmen near Sidi Kacem. The\r\nletters are too much worn to enable the sense of the inscription to be\r\nmade out, but quite sufficient remains to prove that it is in Latin,\r\nand, from the form of the letters, of a late type.[479]\r\n\r\nMonsieur Leternoux found hewn stones and even columnar shafts of Roman\r\nworkmanship among the materials out of which the bazinas at the foot\r\nof the Aures chain had been constructed, and he gives a drawing of a\r\ncippus of late Roman workmanship, bearing an inscription in Berber\r\ncharacter, which he identifies with those on two upright stones of rude\r\nform, one of which forms parts of a circle near Bona.[480]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 174. Circle near Bona.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to these there are numerous instances among the plates\r\nwhich form the volume of the 'Exploration scientifique de l'Algérie'\r\nwhere the rude-stone monuments are so mixed up with those of late Roman\r\nand early Christian character that it seems impossible to doubt that\r\nthey are contemporary. As no text, however, has yet been published to\r\naccompany these plates, it is most unsafe to rely on any individual\r\nexample, which from some fault of the draughtsman or engraver may\r\nbe misleading. The general impression, however, which these plates\r\nconvey is decidedly in favour of a post-Roman date, and of their being\r\ncomparatively modern. It requires, however, some one on the spot, whose\r\nattention is specially directed to the subject, to determine whether\r\nthe rude-stone monuments are earlier than those which are hewn, or\r\nwhether the contrary is not sometimes, perhaps always, the case. If\r\nM. Bertrand is right, and the Faustina tomb is of any value as an\r\nindication of age, certainly sometimes at least, the rude monuments are\r\nthe more modern. Carthage fell B.C. 146, and the Jugurthan\r\nwar ended B.C. 106, and it is impossible to conceive that\r\na people like the Romans, would possess as they did the sovereignty\r\nof northern Africa, after that date, and not leave their mark on it,\r\nin the shape of buildings of various sorts. If we adopt the usual\r\nprogressive theory, all must be anterior to B.C. 100; for on\r\nthat hypothesis it would be considered most improbable that after long\r\ncontact with Carthaginian civilization and under the direct influence\r\nof that of Rome anyone could prefer rude uncommunicative masses to\r\nstructures composed of polished and engraved stones. It certainly was\r\nso, however, to a very great extent, and my impression is, for the\r\nreasons above given, that the bulk of these North African dolmens are\r\nsubsequent to the Christian era, and that they extend well into the\r\nperiod of the Mahommedan domination, for it could not, for a long\r\ntime at least, have been so complete as entirely to obliterate the\r\nfeelings and usages so long indulged in by the aboriginal inhabitants\r\nof the country. Nothing, indeed, would surprise me less than if it were\r\neventually shown that some of these rude-stone monuments extended down\r\nto the times of the Crusades. As, however, we are not yet in a position\r\nto prove this, it is only put forward here as a suggestion, in order\r\nthat those who may hereafter have the task of opening these tombs may\r\nnot reject any evidence of their being so late, as they probably would\r\ndo if imbued with prehistoric prejudices.\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that the question who the people were that set up\r\nthese African dolmens must wait for an answer till we know more of\r\nthe ethnography of northern Africa in ancient times than we do at\r\npresent. The only people who, so far as we now see, seem to be able\r\nto claim them, are the Nasamones. From Herodotus we learn that this\r\npeople buried their dead sitting, with their knees doubled up to their\r\nchins, and were so particular about this that, when a man was dying,\r\nthey propped him up that he might die in that attitude (iv. 190). We\r\nalso learn from him that they had such reverence for the tombs of their\r\nancestors that it was their practice in their solemn form of oath to\r\nlay their hands on these tombs, and so invoke their sanction; and in\r\ntheir mode of divination they used to sleep in or on these sepulchres\r\n(iv. 172). All this would agree perfectly with what we find, but\r\nHerodotus unfortunately never visited the country nor saw these tombs,\r\nand consequently does not describe them, and we do not know whether\r\nthey were mere mounds of earth, or cairns of stone, or dolmens such\r\nas are found in Africa. It is also unfortunate for their claim that,\r\nin his day, the Nasamones lived near the Syrtes and to the eastward\r\nof them (ii. 32), and it seems hardly possible that they could have\r\nincreased and multiplied to such an extent in the four following\r\ncenturies as to occupy northern Africa as far as Mount Atlas, without\r\neither the Greeks or the Romans having known it. They are mentioned\r\nagain by Curtius (iv. 7), by Lucan (ix. v. 439), and by Silius Italicus\r\n(ii. v. 116 and xi. v. 180), but always as a plundering Libyan tribe,\r\nnever as a great people occupying the northern country. Their claim,\r\ntherefore, to be considered the authors of the thousands of dolmens\r\nwhich are even now found in the province of Algeria, seems for the\r\npresent wholly inadmissible.\r\n\r\nStill less can we admit M. Bertrand's theory alluded to above, that the\r\ndolmen-builders migrated from the Baltic to Britain, and thence through\r\nFrance and Spain to Africa. Such a migration, requiring long land\r\njourneys and sea voyages, if it took place at all, is much more likely\r\nto have been accomplished when commercial intercourse was established,\r\nand the North Sea and the Mediterranean were covered with sailing\r\nvessels of all sorts; but then it is unlikely that a rude people, as\r\nthe dolmen-builders are assumed to be, could have availed themselves of\r\nthese trade routes.\r\n\r\nStill no one can look at such monuments as this of Aveyron (woodcuts\r\nNos. 8 and 122) and compare them with those of Algeria, of which\r\nwoodcut No. 169 is a type, without feeling that there was a connection,\r\nand an intimate one, at the dolmen period, between the people on the\r\nnorthern with those on the southern shores of the Mediterranean, which\r\ncan only be accounted for in one of three ways.\r\n\r\nEither it was that history was only repeating itself when Marshal\r\nBougeaud landed in Algeria in 1830, and proceeded to conquer and\r\ncolonise Algeria for the French. Or we must assume, as has often been\r\ndone, that some people wandering from the east to colonise western\r\nEurope left these traces of their passage in Africa on their way\r\nwestward. The third hypothesis is that already insisted upon at the end\r\nof the Scandinavian chapter, which regards these rude-stone monuments\r\nas merely the result of a fashion which sprung up at a particular\r\nperiod, and was adopted by all those people who, like the Nasamones,\r\nreverenced their dead and practised ancestral worship rather than that\r\nof an external divinity.\r\n\r\nOf all these three hypotheses, the second seems the least tenable,\r\nthough it is the one most generally adopted. The Pyramids were built,\r\non the most moderate computation, at least 3000 B.C.[481]\r\nEgypt was then a highly civilized and populous country, and the art of\r\ncutting and polishing stones of the hardest nature had reached a degree\r\nof perfection in that country in those days which has never since been\r\nsurpassed, and must have been practised for thousands of years before\r\nthat time in order to reach the stage of perfection in which we there\r\nfind it. Is it possible to conceive any savage Eastern race rushing\r\nacross the Nile on its way westward, and carrying their rude arts with\r\nthem, and continuing to practise them for four or five thousand years\r\nafterwards without change? Either it seems more probable to assume that\r\nthe Egyptians would have turned them back, or if they had sojourned\r\nin their land like the Israelites, and then departed because they\r\nfound the bondage intolerable, it is almost certain that they would\r\nhave carried with them some of the arts and civilization of the people\r\namong whom they had dwelt. If such a migration did take place, it must\r\nhave been in prehistoric times so remote that its occurrence can have\r\nbut little bearing on the argument as to who built these Algerian\r\nmonuments. But did they come by sea? Did the dolmen-building races\r\nembark from the ports of Palestine or those of Asia Minor? Were they in\r\nfact the far-famed Phœnicians, to whom antiquaries have been so fond\r\nof ascribing these structures. The first answer to this is that there\r\nare no dolmens in Phœnicia, and that they have not yet been found\r\nnear Carthage, nor Utica, nor in Sicily, nor indeed anywhere where the\r\nPhœnicians had colonies. They are not even found at Marseilles,\r\nwhere they settled, though on the western bank of the Rhone, where they\r\nhad no establishments, they are found in numbers. They may have traded\r\nwith Cornwall, and discovered lands even farther north, but to assume\r\nthat so small a people could have erected all the megalithic remains\r\nfound in Scandinavia and the continent of France, and other countries\r\nwhere they never settled, perhaps never visited, is to ascribe great\r\neffects to causes so insignificant as to be wholly incommensurable.\r\nSo wholly inadequate does the Phœnician power seem to have been to\r\nproduce such effects, that the proposition would probably never have\r\nbeen brought forward had the extent of the dolmen region been known at\r\nthe time it was suggested. Even putting the element of time aside, it\r\nis now clearly untenable, and if there is any truth in the date above\r\nassigned to this class of monuments, it is mere idleness to argue it.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a migration from France to Algeria is by no means so\r\nillogical. The French dolmens, so far as is now known, seem certainly\r\nolder than the African--a fact which, if capable of proof, is fatal to\r\nthe last suggestion--and if we assume that this class of monument was\r\ninvented in western Europe, it only requires that the element of time\r\nshould be suitable to establish this hypothesis. When the Celts of\r\ncentral Gaul, six centuries before the Christian era, began to extend\r\ntheir limits and to press upon those of the Aquitanians, did the latter\r\nflee from their oppressors to seek refuge in Africa, as at a latter\r\nperiod the dolmen-builders of Spain sought repose in the green island\r\nof the west? There certainly appears to be no great improbability that\r\nthey may have done so to such an extent as to cause the adoption of\r\nthis form of architecture after it had become prevalent elsewhere; and\r\nas the encroaching Celts, down to the prosecution of the middle ages,\r\nmay have driven continual streams of colonists in the same direction,\r\nthis would account for all the phenomena we find, provided we may\r\nascribe that modern date to the Algerian examples which to me appears\r\nundoubted.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly probable, however, that the Aquitanians would have sought\r\nrefuge in Africa unless some kindred tribe existed there to afford them\r\nshelter and a welcome. If such a race did exist, that would go far to\r\nget rid of most of the difficulties of the problem. We are, however,\r\nfar too ignorant of North African ethnography to be able to say whether\r\nany such people were there, or if so, who their representatives may now\r\nbe, and till our ignorance is dispelled, it is idle to speculate on\r\nmere probabilities.\r\n\r\nWe know something of the migrations of the peoples settled around the\r\nshores of the Mediterranean for at least ten centuries before the birth\r\nof Christ, but neither in Greek or Roman or Carthaginian history, nor\r\nin any of the traditions of their literature, do we find a hint of any\r\nmigration of a rude people, either across Egypt or by sea from Asia,\r\nand, what is perhaps more to the point, we have no trace of it in any\r\nof the intermediate islands. The Nurhags of Sardinia, the Talayots of\r\nthe Balearic Islands, are monuments of quite a different class from\r\nanything found in France or Algeria. So too are the tombs of Malta,\r\nand, as just mentioned, there are no such remains in Sicily.\r\n\r\nWe seem thus forced back on the third hypothesis, which contemplates\r\nthe rise of a dolmen style of architecture at some not very remote\r\nperiod of the world's history, and its general diffusion among all\r\nthose kindred races of mankind with whom respect for the spirits of\r\ndeceased ancestors was a leading characteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIPOLI.\r\n\r\nDr. Barth seems to be the only traveller who has in recent times\r\nexplored the regions about Tripoli to a sufficient extent and with\r\nthe requisite knowledge to enable him to observe whether or not there\r\nwere any rude-stone monuments in that district. About halfway between\r\nMoursuk and Ghât, he observed \"a circle laid out very regularly with\r\nlarge slabs, like the opening of a well; and, on the plain above the\r\ncliffs, another circle regularly laid out, \"and,\" he adds, \"like the\r\nmany circles seen in Cyrenaica and in other parts of Northern Africa,\r\nevidently connected with the religious rites of the ancient inhabitants\r\nof these regions.\"[482] This is meagre enough; but fortunately, in\r\naddition to this, he observed and drew two monuments which are of equal\r\nand perhaps even of more importance to our present purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 175. Trilithon at Ksaea.]\r\n\r\nOne of these, situated at a place called Ksaea, about forty-five miles\r\neast by south from Tripoli, consists of six pairs of trilithons,\r\nsimilar to that represented in the annexed woodcut. No plan is given\r\nof their arrangement, nor does Dr. Barth speculate as to their use;\r\nhe only remarks that \"they could never have been intended as doors,\r\nfor the space between the upright stones is so narrow that a man of\r\nordinary size could hardly squeeze his way between them.\"[483]\r\n\r\nThe other, situated at Elkeb, about the same distance from Tripoli,\r\nbut south by east, is even more curious. It, too, is a trilithon, but\r\nthe supports, which are placed on a masonry platform two steps in\r\nheight, slope inwards, with all the appearance of being copied from a\r\ncarpentry form, and the cap-stone likewise projects beyond the uprights\r\nin a manner very unusual in masonry. Another curious indication of its\r\nwooden origin is that the western pillar has three quadrangular holes\r\non its inner side, 6 inches square, while the corresponding holes in\r\nthe eastern pillar go quite through. These pillars are 2 feet square\r\nand 10 feet high, while the impost measures 6 feet 6 inches.[484]\r\n\r\nIn front of these pillars lies a stone with a square sinking in it\r\nand a spout at one side. Whatever this may have been intended for, it\r\nis--if the woodcut and description are to be depended upon--the exact\r\ncounterpart of a Hindu Yoni, and as such would not excite remark as\r\nhaving anything unusual in its appearance if found in a modern temple\r\nat Benares. Beyond these in the woodcut are seen several other stones,\r\nevidently belonging to the same monument, one of which seems to have\r\nbeen formed into a throne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 176. Trilithon at Elkeb. From a Drawing by Dr. Barth.]\r\n\r\nThese monuments are not, of course, alone. There must be\r\nothers--probably many others--in the country, a knowledge of which\r\nmight throw considerable light on our enquiries. In the meanwhile the\r\nfirst thing that strikes one is that Jeffrey of Monmouth's assertion,\r\nthat \"Giants in old days brought from Africa the stones which the\r\nmagic arts of Merlin afterwards removed from Kildare and set up at\r\nStonehenge,\"[485] is not so entirely devoid of foundation as might at\r\nfirst sight appear. The removal of the stones is, of course, absurd,\r\nbut the suggestion and design may possibly have travelled west by this\r\nroute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 177. Buddhist Monument at Bangkok. From Mouhot's\r\n'Travels in Indo-China, Cambodia, &c.' vol. i. p. 218.]\r\n\r\nIf we now turn back to page 100, it seems impossible not to be struck\r\nwith, the likeness that exists between woodcut No. 25 and woodcuts 175\r\nand 176, especially the first. Such similarity is more than sufficient\r\nto take away all improbability from Dr. Barth's suggestion that \"the\r\ntraces of art which they display may be ascribed to Roman influence.\"\r\nIt also renders it nearly certain that these African trilithons were\r\nsepulchral, and adds another to the many proofs adduced above that\r\nStonehenge was both sepulchral and post-Roman.\r\n\r\nThe most curious point, however, connected with these monuments is\r\nthe suggestion of Indian influence which they--especially that at\r\nElkeb--give rise to. The introduction of sloping jambs, derived\r\nfrom carpentry forms, can be traced back in India, in the caves of\r\nBehar[486] and the Western Ghâts, to the second century before Christ,\r\nbut certainly to no earlier date. The carpentry forms, but without the\r\nsloping jambs, continued at Sanchi and the Ajunta caves till some time\r\nafter the Christian era, and where wood is used has, in fact, continued\r\nto the present day. \"Mutatis mutandis,\" no two monuments can well be\r\nmore alike to one another than that at Elkeb and the Buddhist tomb at\r\nBangkok, represented in woodcut 177. The Siamese tomb may be a hundred\r\nyears old; and if we allow the African trilithon to be late Roman, we\r\nhave some fourteen or fifteen centuries between them, which, certainly,\r\nis as long as can reasonably be demanded. In reality it was probably\r\nless, but if the one was prehistoric, we lose altogether the thread of\r\nassociation and tradition that ought to connect the two.\r\n\r\nTo all this we shall have occasion to return, and then to discuss\r\nit more at length, when speaking of the Indian monuments and their\r\nconnection with those of the West. In the meanwhile these two form a\r\nstepping-stone of sufficient importance to make us feel how desirable\r\nit is that the country where they are found should be more carefully\r\nexamined. My impression is that the key to most of our mysteries is\r\nhidden in these African deserts.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 464: 'International Congress,' Norwich volume, 1869, p.\r\n    196.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 465: Norwich volume of 'Prehistoric Congress,' p. 196.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 466: A very imperfect one appeared in the 'Revue\r\n    archéologique,' in 1865, vol. xi. pl. v.

Strictly speaking,\r\nthey hardly come within the limits assigned to this book, for they are\r\nnot truly megalithic in the sense in which the term has been used in\r\nthe previous pages; for though stones 15 feet and 20 feet high are used\r\nin the Maltese monuments, they are shaped and, it may be said, hewn\r\nwith metal tools, and they are used constructively with smaller stones,\r\nso as to form walls and roofs, and cannot therefore be considered as\r\nRude Stone Monuments. Still they have so much affinity with these, and\r\nare so mixed up in all works treating of the subject with Druidical\r\nremains and prehistoric mysteries, that it certainly seems expedient to\r\nexplain as far as possible their forms and uses.\r\n\r\nThe monuments are of three classes. The first, found in Malta, are\r\nthere called giants' towers--\"Torre dei giganti\"--a name having\r\nno meaning, but which, as also involving no hypothesis, it may be\r\nconvenient to adhere to. The second class, called Nurhags, are peculiar\r\nto Sardinia. The third, or Talyots, are found only in the Balearic\r\nislands. There may be some connection between the two last groups, but\r\neven then with certain local peculiarities sufficient to distinguish\r\nthem. The Maltese monuments however stand alone, and have certainly no\r\nconnection with the other two, and, as it will appear in the sequel,\r\nnone of the three have any very clear affinity with any known monuments\r\non the continent of either Europe or Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALTA.\r\n\r\nThe best known monuments of the Maltese groups are situated near the\r\ncentre of the Isle of Gozo, in the commune of Barbato. When Houel\r\nwrote in 1787,[487] only the outside wall with the apse of one of the\r\ninner chambers and the entrance of another were known. He mistook\r\nthe right-hand apse of the second pair of chambers for part of a\r\ncircle, and so represented it with a dolmen in the centre, led to this\r\napparently by the existence of a real circle which then was found at\r\na distance of 350 yards from the main group. This circle was 140 feet\r\nin diameter, composed of stones ranged close together and alternately\r\nbroad and tall, as shown in the next woodcut, which represents the rear\r\nof the principal monument. The entrance was marked by two very tall\r\nstones, apparently 20 feet high. The interior was apparently rugged,\r\nbut there is nothing in the plates to show from what cause. When Houel\r\nmade his plan,[488] it had all the appearance of being what was styled\r\na regular \"Druidical circle,\" and might have been used as such to\r\nsupport any Druidical theory. It is now however evident that it really\r\nwas only the commencement of the envelope of a pair of chambers, such\r\nas we find in all the monuments of this class on these islands. If the\r\nplan is correct, it was the most regular of any, which, besides its\r\nhaving every appearance of never having been completed, would lead\r\nus to suppose that it was the last of the series. This monument has\r\nnow entirely disappeared, as has also another of even more megalithic\r\nappearance which stood within a few yards of the principal group, but\r\nof which unfortunately we have neither plan nor details. It is shown\r\nwith tolerable distinctness in a view in Mr. Frere's possession, and\r\nin the plates which are engraved from drawings by a native artist,\r\nwhich Admiral Smyth brought home in 1827,[489] and which are engraved\r\nin volume xxii. of the 'Archæologia.' Unfortunately the text that\r\naccompanies these plates is of the most unsatisfactory character. This\r\nhe partially explains by saying that he had left his measurements with\r\nColonel Otto Beyer, who had just caused the principal pair of chambers\r\nto be excavated.\r\n\r\nThe second pair of chambers was excavated by Sir Henry Bouverie when\r\nhe was governor, some time before or about 1836, when a careful plan\r\nand drawings of the whole were published by Count de la Marmora.[490]\r\nIt has been re-engraved by Gailhabaud and others, and is well known to\r\narchæologists.\r\n\r\nThe monuments thus brought to light consisted of two pairs of\r\nelliptical chambers very similar in dimensions and plan to those at\r\nMnaidra (woodcut No. 179). The greatest depth internally from the\r\nentrance to the apse of the principal pair is 90 feet; the greatest\r\nwidth across both 130 feet. The right-hand pair as you enter is\r\ncomparatively plain. The outer chamber of the left-hand pair still\r\nretained, when excavated, fittings that looked like an altar in the\r\nright-hand apse, which was separated from the rest by what may be\r\ncalled the choir-screen or altar-rail; and this was ornamented with\r\nspirals and geometric figures neatly and sharply cut. In the inner\r\nchamber was a stone, near the entrance, on which was a bas-relief of\r\na serpent, but no other representation of any thing living was found\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 178. View of the exterior of the Giants' Tower at Gozo.\r\nFrom a drawing in the possession of Sir Bartle Frere, K.C.B.]\r\n\r\nThe external appearance of the monument may be gathered from the\r\nwoodcut No. 178. The lower part of the wall is composed alternately--as\r\nin the circle just alluded to--of large stones laid on their sides and\r\nsmaller ones standing perpendicularly between them. Above this the\r\ncourses of stones are of regular masonry, and probably there was some\r\nkind of cornice or string-course before the beginning of the roof, but\r\nof this no trace now remains in any of these monuments.\r\n\r\nThe second group, known as Hagiar Khem, is situated near Krendi, on the\r\nsouth side of the island of Malta, and is the most extensive one known.\r\nThe principal monument contains, besides the usual pair of chambers,\r\nfour or five lateral chambers; and a short way to the north is a second\r\nmonument, containing at least one pair; and to the south a third\r\ngroup, but so ruined it is difficult to make out the plan. Only the\r\ntops of the walls and the tall stones which still rise above the walls\r\nwere known to exist of the monument, till in 1839 Sir Henry Bouverie\r\nauthorized the expenditure of some public money to excavate it. An\r\naccount of these excavations, with a plan and drawings, was published\r\nin Malta at the time by Lieutenant Foulis. The plan was repeated, in\r\nless detail however, in the 'Archæologia,'[491] and afterwards in the\r\nNorwich volume of the International Prehistoric Congress, by Mr. Furze,\r\nfrom a survey recently made by the Royal Engineers.\r\n\r\nThe third group, known as that at Mnaidra, is situated not far from the\r\nlast, between it and the sea; and as it never has been published, a\r\nplan of it is given here[492] from a survey made by Corporal Mortimer,\r\nof the Royal Engineers. Like the Gozo monument, it consists of two\r\npairs of oval chambers in juxtaposition. The right-hand pair, in this\r\ninstance, is larger and simpler in design than that on the left, but\r\nit is so nearly identical, both in plan and dimensions, with the\r\nright-hand pair at Gozo that they are probably of the same age and\r\nserved the same purpose. They are also, as nearly as may be, of the\r\nsame dimensions: both would be enclosed, with their side walls, by\r\na circle 75 feet in diameter. The left-hand cone at Mnaidra would be\r\nnearly of the same diameter; but at Gozo the corresponding enclosure\r\nwould require to be, and in fact was, 100 feet in diameter, and the\r\ninner room, measuring 80 feet by 50 feet, including the apse, was the\r\nlargest and finest apartment of the class in the islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 179. Plan of Monument of Mnaidra. From one by Corporal\r\nMortimer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 180. Section, on the line A B, through Lower Pair of\r\nChambers, Mnaidra.]\r\n\r\nThe section through the lower chambers (woodcut No. 180) will suffice\r\nto explain the general appearance of these buildings internally,\r\nas they now stand. A is the entrance into a small square apartment\r\nin which the altar or table stands, shown more completely in the\r\nnext woodcut (No. 181), from a photograph, which also renders much\r\nmore clear the peculiar style of ornamenting with innumerable \"pit\r\nmarkings,\" peculiar to these Maltese monuments. D is the entrance\r\ninto the other chamber, which but for the interference of that last\r\ndescribed, would have been of the usual elliptical form. My impression\r\nis that the left-hand apse was removed at some time subsequent to the\r\nerection of the monument, to admit of its insertion. On each side of\r\nthe doorway are seats, C and E, which are always found in similar\r\nsituations. Beyond, at F, is one of those mysterious openings which are\r\nso frequent; it is also seen with another in Woodcut No. 182. Between\r\nthis apartment and the upper apartment H are two tiers of shelves or\r\nloculi, which are also found at Gozo, and for which it is difficult to\r\nsuggest a meaning if they were not used as columbaria for sepulchral\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 181. Entrance to Chamber B, Mnaidra, showing Table\r\ninside. (The Rod is divided into English feet.)]\r\n\r\nA difficult question here arises as to which of these two pairs of\r\napartments is the older--the upper, with the simpler style and the\r\nsmaller stones, or the apartments with the larger stones and more\r\nornate arrangements. On the whole, I am inclined to think the simpler\r\nthe older: among other reasons because the floor of the right-hand pair\r\nat Mnaidra is 10 feet above the level of the left-hand apartments. As\r\nthe edifices are all placed on heights, it seems improbable that the\r\nfirst comer would have chosen a site commanded by a knoll 10 feet above\r\nhim, and touching his half-buried building. But, besides this local\r\nindication, it seems probable that the style was progressive, and that\r\nthis right-hand chamber at Mnaidra may be the oldest, and the great one\r\nat Gozo the last completed of all which we know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 182. North End of Left-hand Outer Chamber at Mnaidra.\r\nFrom a photograph.]\r\n\r\nThe excavations at Mnaidra as well as those at Hagiar Khem have\r\nsufficed to settle the question of how these buildings were roofed. The\r\nabove woodcut, from a photograph, shows the springing of the roof of\r\nthe north end of the outer left-hand chamber, but, like photographs in\r\ngeneral, does so unintelligently. Colonel Collinson, however, informs\r\nme that they bracket outwards, at the rate of 1 foot in 10, and he\r\ncalculates that they would meet at a height of 30 feet so nearly that\r\nthey could be closed by a single stone. He, however, overlooks the\r\nfact that all these horizontally-constructed domes, whether in Greece,\r\nor Italy, or Sardinia, are curvilinear, their section being that of a\r\nGothic pointed arch, and consequently, if corbelling forward at the\r\nrate of 1 in 10 near the springing, they would certainly meet in this\r\nchamber at 15 or 20 feet from their base. When we recollect that before\r\nthe Trojan war the Pelasgic architects of Greece roofed chambers 50 and\r\n60 feet in diameter (_vide ante_, page 33), we should not be surprised\r\nat the Maltese architects grappling with apses of 20 feet span. This\r\nhas generally been admitted as easy, but several authors have been\r\npuzzled to think how the flat spaces joining the two apses could have\r\nbeen so roofed. A careful examination of the plans of the Maltese\r\nbuilding seems to make this easy. Looking, for instance, at the plan\r\nof Mnaidra, a retaining wall will be observed on the extreme right,\r\nwhich is a segment of a circle 75 feet in diameter, and continuing it\r\nall round, it encloses both chambers. If a similar circle is drawn\r\nround the left-hand chambers, it equally encloses them, and the circles\r\nosculate, or have one party wall at a point where there is the group\r\nof cells. This granted, it is easy to see that the external form of\r\nthe roof was a stepped cone, covering the inner roofs, and so avoiding\r\nthe ridges and hollows which would have rendered independent roofing\r\nimpracticable. The external appearance of the building would thus have\r\nbeen that of two equal cones joined together, and rising probably to\r\na height of 50 feet above their springing. To erect such a cone on an\r\nenclosing wall only 8 or 10 feet thick may appear at first sight a\r\nlittle difficult for such rude builders as the Maltese were when they\r\nerected these domes, but when we recollect that the cone was divided\r\ninto two by a cross party wall, which may have been carried the whole\r\nheight, all difficulty vanishes.\r\n\r\nWhen we apply these principles to the ruins at Hagiar Khem, their\r\nhistory becomes plain at once. Originally the monument seems to have\r\nconsisted of a single pair of chambers of the usual form, A and B of\r\nthe accompanying plan; but extension becoming necessary, the central\r\napse of the inner apartment was removed and converted into a doorway,\r\nand the left-hand lateral apse was also removed so as to make an\r\nentrance into four other ovoid apartments, which were arranged radially\r\nso as to be covered by a cone 90 feet in diameter. Here again the\r\ndifficulty, if any, of constructing a cone of these dimensions is got\r\nover by the numerous points of support from perpendicular walls which\r\nhoneycomb the building. The external appearance of this building would\r\nbe that of one great cone 90 feet in diameter covering the cells, and\r\nanastomosing with one 60 feet, or one-third less, in diameter covering\r\nthe entrance chambers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 183. Plan of Hagiar Khem, partially restored.]\r\n\r\nRestored in this manner, the external appearance of these monuments\r\nwould have been very similar to that of the Kubber Roumeia near Algiers\r\nand the Madracen near Blidah. The former was 200 feet in diameter, with\r\na cone rising in steps to the height of 130 feet, which was lower in\r\nproportion than suggested above, but its interior was nearly solid,\r\nand admitted therefore of any angle that might appear most beautiful.\r\nThe Madracen looks even lower, but no correct section of it has been\r\npublished. The Kubber Roumeia has now been ascertained to have been the\r\ntomb of the Mauritanian kings down to the time of Juba II., or about\r\nthe Christian era.[493] Judging from its style, the Madracen may be a\r\ncentury earlier. Be this as it may, it hardly seems to me doubtful but\r\nthat these tombs are late Roman translations of a type to which the\r\nMaltese examples belonged; but the intermediate links in the long chain\r\nwhich connects them have yet to be recovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 184. View of Madracen. From a plate in Blakesley's 'Four\r\nMonths in Algeria.']\r\n\r\nInternally, these Maltese monuments are rude, and exhibit very little\r\nattempt at decoration. The inner apartments, being dark, are quite\r\nplain, but the outer, admitting a certain quantity of light by the\r\ndoor, have a proportionate amount of ornament. At Gozo, in the outer\r\napartment, there are, as mentioned above, scrolls and spirals of a\r\nstyle very much more refined than is found in Ireland or in rude\r\nmonuments generally, but more resembling that of those found at Mycenæ\r\nand other parts of Greece. At Hagiar Khem and Mnaidra the favourite\r\nornament are pit markings. Whether these have any affinity with those\r\nwhich Sir J. Simpson so copiously illustrated,[494] is by no means\r\nclear. In Malta they are spread evenly over the stone, and are such a\r\ndecoration as might be used at the present day (woodcut No. 181). An\r\naltar was found in one of the outer chambers at Hagiar Khem, and in\r\nboth the Maltese monuments, stone tables from 4 to 5 feet high (one is\r\nshown in the woodcut No. 181), the use of which is not clearly made\r\nout. They are too tall for altars, and, unless in the Balearic Islands,\r\nnothing like them is known elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been said above, it is hardly worth while to enter\r\ninto the argument whether these buildings are temples or tombs. Their\r\nsituation alone, in this instance, is sufficient to prove that they do\r\nnot belong to the former class. Men do not drop three or four temples\r\nirregularly, as at Gozo, within a stone's throw of one another, on a\r\nbare piece of ground, far away from any centres of population. The same\r\nis the case at Hagiar Khem, where certainly three, probably four, sets\r\nof chambers exist; and Mnaidra may almost be considered a part of the\r\nsame group or cemetery.\r\n\r\nMalta, it is said, was colonised by the Phœnicians, at least was\r\nso in Diodorus' time,[495] though how much earlier they occupied it,\r\nwe are not told, nor to what extent they superseded the original\r\ninhabitants. We also learn incidentally that they possessed temples\r\ndedicated to Melkart and Astarte. This is very probable, and if so,\r\ntheir remains will be found near their harbours, and where they\r\nestablished themselves; and Colonel Collinson informs me that remains\r\nof columnar buildings have been found both at Marsa Sirocco and near\r\nthe dockyard creek at Valetta. These, most probably, are the remains\r\nof the temples in question, though possibly rebuilt in Roman times.\r\nThe little images found in the apartments at Hagiar Khem may be\r\nrepresentations of the Cabeiri, though I doubt it; but little headless\r\ndeformities, 20 inches high, some of stone and some of clay, are not\r\nthe divinities that would be worshipped in such temples, though they\r\nmight be offerings at a tomb.\r\n\r\nIf these buildings were tombs, they were the burying-places of a people\r\nwho burnt their dead and carefully preserved their ashes, and who\r\npaid the utmost respect to their buried dead long after their decease.\r\nThe inner apartments have shelves and cupboards in stone, and numerous\r\nlittle arrangements which it seems impossible to understand except on\r\nthe supposition that they were places for the deposit of these sacred\r\nremains. Some of the recesses have doors cut out of a single slab 2 and\r\n3 feet square at the opening, some are so small that a man could hardly\r\nsqueeze himself through, and some are holes into which only an arm\r\ncould be thrust,[496] but from the rebate outside of all, the intention\r\nseems to have been for them all to be closed.\r\n\r\nAlthough from all these arrangements it may broadly be asserted that\r\nthey are not temples in the ordinary sense of the term; the outer\r\napartments may be considered as halls in which religious ceremonies\r\nwere performed in honour of the dead, and, so far, as places of\r\nworship; but essentially they were sepulchres, and their uses\r\nsepulchral.\r\n\r\nWe know so little of the ancient history of Malta that it is extremely\r\ndifficult even to guess who the people were who erected and used these\r\nsepulchres. Most people would at once answer, the Phœnicians;\r\nbut, in order to establish their claim, one of two things is\r\nnecessary--either we must have some direct testimony that they erected\r\nthese monuments, or we must be able to show that they erected similar\r\ntombs either near their own homes or elsewhere. Neither kind of proof\r\nis forthcoming. No such tombs are found near Tyre or Sidon, or near\r\nCarthage, and classical authorities are absolutely silent on the\r\nsubject. The monuments most like them are the tombs at Mycenæ, but the\r\ndifferences are so great that I would hesitate to lay much stress on\r\nany slight similarities that exist. The Greek monuments were always\r\nintended to be buried in tumuli. Those at Malta have so strongly marked\r\nand so ornamental a podium outside that it is evident they never were\r\nso covered up. It may be difficult to prove it, but I fancy if we are\r\never to find their originals, it is to Africa we must look for them.\r\nThey are too unlike anything else in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt seems even more difficult to define their age than to ascertain\r\ntheir origin. Looking at the nature of the stone, their state of\r\npreservation, and other circumstances, I cannot believe they are\r\nvery old. If they were in Greece, or in Europe, or anywhere where\r\nthey could be compared with other monuments, some useful inferences\r\nmight be drawn; but they are so unique that this mode is unavailable.\r\nWe have nothing we can confidently compare them with, and we are so\r\nentirely ignorant of the ancient history of Malta that we cannot tell\r\nin the least at what age she reached that stage of civilization which\r\nthe workmanship of these monuments represents. We are probably safe,\r\nhowever, in assuming that they are pre-Roman, and as safe in believing\r\nthat they are not earlier than the monuments of Mycenæ and Thyrns;\r\nin short, that they belong to some period between the Trojan and the\r\nPunic wars, but are most probably much nearer to the former than to the\r\nlatter epoch in the world's history.\r\n\r\n\r\nSARDINIA.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious illustration of the fragmentary nature of society in\r\nthe ancient world that Sardinia should possess a class of monuments\r\nabsolutely peculiar to itself. It is not this time ten or a dozen\r\nmonuments, like those of Malta, but they are numbered by thousands, and\r\nso like one another that it is impossible to mistake them, and, what\r\nis still more singular, as difficult to trace any progress or change\r\namong them. The Talyots of the Balearic Islands may resemble them, but,\r\nexcepting these, the Nurhags of Sardinia stand quite alone. Nothing the\r\nleast like them is found in Italy, or in Sicily, or, indeed, anywhere\r\nelse, so far as is at present known.\r\n\r\nA Nurhag is easily recognized and easily described. It is always a\r\nround tower, with sides sloping at an angle of about 10 degrees to the\r\nhorizon, its dimensions varying from 20 to 60 feet in diameter, and its\r\nheight being generally equal to the width of the base. Sometimes they\r\nare one, frequently two and even three storeys in height, the centre\r\nbeing always occupied by circular chambers, constructed by projecting\r\nstones forming a dome with the section of a pointed arch. The chamber\r\ngenerally occupies one-third of the diameter, the thickness of the\r\nwalls forming the remaining two-thirds. There is invariably a ramp\r\nor staircase leading to the platform at the top of the tower. These\r\npeculiarities will be understood from the annexed section and plan of\r\none from De la Marmora's work.[497]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 185. Nurhag. From De la Marmora.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 186. Nurhag of Santa Barbara.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Nurhags are of more than one storey in height, they are\r\ngenerally surrounded by others which are attached to them by platforms,\r\noften of considerable extent. That at Santa Barbara has, or had, four\r\nsmall Nurhags encased in the four corners of the platform, to which\r\naccess was obtained by a doorway in the central tower; but frequently\r\nthere are also separate ramps when the platforms are extensive. The\r\nmasonry of these monuments is generally neat, though sometimes the\r\nstones are unhewn, but nowhere does there appear any attempt at\r\nmegalithic magnificence.\r\n\r\nThey are, at the same time, absolutely without any architectural\r\nornament which could give us any hint of their affinities; and no\r\ninscriptions, no images, no sculptures of any kind, have been found in\r\nthem. They are in this respect as uncommunicative as our own rude-stone\r\nmonuments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 187. Nurhag of Santa Barbara. From De la Marmora.]\r\n\r\nWritten history is almost equally silent. Only one passage has\r\nbeen disinterred which seems to refer to them. It is a Greek work,\r\ngenerally known as 'De Mirabilibus Auscultationibus,'[498] and ascribed\r\ndoubtfully to Aristotle. It is to the following effect:--\"It is said\r\nthat in the island of Sardinia there exist, among other beautiful\r\nand numerous edifices, built after the manner of the ancient Greeks,\r\ncertain domes (Θόλοι) of exquisite proportions. It is further\r\nsaid that they were built by Iolas, son of Iphicles, who, having taken\r\nwith him the Thespiadæ, went to colonise this island.\" This certainly\r\nlooks as if the Nurhags existed when this book was written, though the\r\ndescription is by a person who evidently never saw them. Diodorus so\r\nfar confirms this that he says: \"Iolaus, having founded the colony,\r\nfetched Dedalus from Sicily, and built numerous and grand edifices,\r\nwhich subsist to the present day, and are called Dedalean, from the\r\nname of their builder;\"[499] and in another paragraph he recurs to\r\nthe veneration \"in which the name of Iolaus is held.\" This, too, is\r\nunsatisfactory, as written by a person who never visited the island,\r\nand had not seen the monuments of which he was speaking.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is little to be wondered at if buildings so mysterious and so unlike\r\nany known to exist elsewhere should have given rise to speculations\r\nalmost as wild as those that hang around our own rude-stone monuments.\r\nThe various theories which have been advanced are enumerated and\r\ndescribed by De la Marmora[500] so fully that it will not be necessary\r\nto recapitulate them here, nor to notice any but three, which seem\r\nreally to have some plausible foundation.\r\n\r\nThe first of these assumes the Nurhags to have been watch-towers or\r\nfortifications.\r\n\r\nThe second, that they were temples.\r\n\r\nThe third, that they were tombs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 188. Map of La Giara. From De la Marmora.]\r\n\r\nLooking at the positions in which they are found, the first of these\r\ntheories is not so devoid of foundation as might at first sight appear.\r\nAs a rule, they are all placed on heights, and at such distances as\r\nto be seen from one another, and consequently be able to communicate\r\nby signal at least. Take such an example, for instance, as that of\r\nGiara, near Isili (woodcut No. 188). Any engineer officer would be\r\ndelighted with the manner in which the position is taken up. Every\r\npoint of vantage in the circumference is occupied, and two points in\r\nthe interior fortified, so as to act as supports. The designer of the\r\nentrenched camp at Linz might rub his eyes in astonishment to find\r\nhis inventions forestalled by three thousand years, and by towers\r\nexternally so like his own as hardly to be distinguishable to an\r\nunpractised eye. The form of the towers themselves lends considerable\r\nplausibility to the defensive theory. Such a Nurhag, for instance, as\r\nthat of Santa Barbara (woodcuts Nos. 186, 187), surrounded by four\r\nlesser ones, connected by a platform, and dominated by the central\r\ntower, is a means of defence we might now adopt, provided we may assume\r\nthe existence of a parapet, which has fallen through age.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to look a little more closely at this military question,\r\nwe perceive that we are attempting to apply to a people who certainly\r\nhad no projectiles that would carry farther than arrows, principles\r\nadapted to artillery or musketry fire. The Nurhags are placed at such\r\ndistances as to afford no support to one another before the invention\r\nof gunpowder, and though in themselves not indefensible, they possess\r\nthe radical defect of having no accommodation for their garrisons.\r\nIt is impossible that men could live, cook, and sleep in the little\r\ncircular apartments in their interior, and the platforms added very\r\nlittle to their accommodation. Had the four detached Nurhags at Santa\r\nBarbara been connected with walls only, so as to surround the central\r\ntower with a court, the case would have been very different; but as\r\nin all instances this is filled up, so as to form a platform, it is\r\nevident that it was exposure, not shelter, that was sought in their\r\nconstruction.[501]\r\n\r\nAnother, and even stronger, argument is derived from their number. De\r\nla Marmora asserts that the remains of at least three thousand Nurhags\r\ncan now be traced in Sardinia,[502] and there seems no reason to doubt\r\nthe truth of his calculation, nor his assertion that they were once\r\nmuch more numerous, and that they are dispersed pretty evenly over the\r\nwhole island. Can any one fancy a state of society in such an island\r\nwhich would require that there should be three thousand castles and\r\nyet no fortified cities as places of refuge? They were not erected to\r\nprotect the island against a foreign enemy, because most of them are\r\ninland. They could not be made to serve for the protection of the rich\r\nduring insurrections or civil wars, nor to enable robbers to plunder\r\nin security the peaceful inhabitants of the plain. In short, unless\r\nthe ancient Sardinians lived in a state of society of which we have no\r\nknowledge elsewhere, these Nurhags were certainly not military works.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the second hypothesis and try to consider them as\r\ntemples, we are met by very much the same difficulties as beset the\r\nfortification theory. If temples, they are unlike the temples of any\r\nother people. Generally it is assumed that they were fire temples,\r\nfrom their name _Nur_--in the Semitic languages signifying fire--but\r\nmore from their construction. The little circular chambers in their\r\ninteriors are admirably suited for preserving the sacred fire, and\r\nthe external platforms as well adapted for that Sabean worship of\r\nthe planets which is generally understood to be associated with\r\nfire-worship. But assuming this to be the case, why so numerous? We\r\ncan count on our fingers all the fire-temples that exist, or were ever\r\nknown to exist, in fire-worshipping Persia; and if a dozen satisfied\r\nher spiritual wants, what necessity was there for three thousand,\r\nor probably twice that number, in the small and sparsely inhabited\r\nisland of Sardinia? Had every family, or little village community its\r\nown separate temple on the nearest high place? and did each perform\r\nits own worship separately from the rest? So far as we know, there\r\nis no subordination among them, nothing corresponding to cathedrals,\r\nor parish churches or chapels. Some are smaller, or some form more\r\nextensive groups than others, but a singularly republican equality\r\nreigns throughout, very unlike the hierarchical feeling we find in most\r\nreligions. In one other respect, too, they are unlike the temples of\r\nother nations. None of them are situated in towns or villages, or near\r\nthe centres of population in the island.\r\n\r\nMust we then adopt the third hypothesis, that they were tombs? Here\r\nagain the same difficulties meet us. If they were tombs, they are\r\nunlike those of any other people with whom we are acquainted. Their\r\nnumbers in this instance is, however, no difficulty. It is in the\r\nnature of the case that sepulchres should accumulate, and their number\r\nis consequently one of the strongest arguments in favour of this\r\ndestination. Nor does their situation militate against this view.\r\nNothing is more likely than that a people should like to bury their\r\ndead, on high places, where their tombs can be seen from afar. In fact,\r\nthere does not seem much to be said against this theory, except that\r\nno sepulchral remains have been found in them. It is true that De la\r\nMarmora found a skeleton buried in one at Iselle,[503] and apparently\r\nso placed that the interment must have taken place before the tower was\r\nbuilt, or at all events finished; but the presence of only one corpse\r\nin two thousand nurhags tells strongly against the theory, as where\r\none was placed more would have been found had this form of interment\r\nbeen usual, and amidst the hundreds of ruined and half-ruined nurhags\r\nsome evidence must have been found had any of the usual sepulchral\r\nusages prevailed. To my mind the conclusion seems inevitable that, if\r\nthey were tombs, they were those of a people who, like the Parsees of\r\nthe present day, exposed their dead to be devoured by the birds of the\r\nair. If there is one feature in the nurhags more consistent or more\r\nessential than another, it is that of the stairs or ramps that give\r\naccess to their platforms. It shows, without doubt, that, whether for\r\ndefence, or worship, or burial, the platform was the feature for which\r\nthe edifice was erected, and there it must have been that its purposes\r\nwere fulfilled. But is it possible that such a practice ever prevailed\r\nin Sardinia? It is, of course, precipitate to answer that it did. But\r\nthe custom is old. Anything so exceptional among modern usages is not\r\nthe invention of yesterday, and it may have been far more prevalent\r\nthan it now is, and it may in very ancient times have been brought by\r\nsome Eastern colonists to this Western isle. I dare hardly suggest that\r\nit was so; but this is certain, that such towers would answer in every\r\nrespect perfectly to the \"Towers of Silence\" of the modern Persians,\r\nand the little side chambers in the towers would suit perfectly as\r\nreceptacles of the denuded bones when the time arrived for collecting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOne argument against their being sepulchres has been drawn from the\r\nfact that frequently a different class of graves, called giants' tombs,\r\nis found in their immediate proximity. The conclusion I would draw\r\nfrom this is in a contrary sense. These giants' tombs are generally\r\nlong graves of neatly fitted stones, with a tall frontispiece, which\r\nis formed of one stone, always carefully hewn and sometimes carved. On\r\neach side of the entrance two arms extend so as to form a semicircle in\r\nfront, and when the circle is completed by detached menhirs, these are\r\ngenerally shaped into cones and carved. The whole, in fact, has a more\r\nadvanced and more modern appearance than the nurhags, and, as I read\r\nthe riddle, the inhabitants adopted this form, and that found in the\r\nnurhag at Iselle, after they had ceased to use the nurhag itself as a\r\nmeans of disposing of their dead, but were still clinging to the spots\r\nmade sacred by the ashes of their forefathers.\r\n\r\nThat the nurhags are old scarcely seems to admit of a doubt, though\r\nI know of only one material point of evidence on the subject. It is\r\nthat the pier of a Roman aqueduct has been founded on the stump of a\r\nruined and consequently desecrated nurhag.[504] Some time must have\r\nelapsed before the primitive and sacred use of the nurhag had been so\r\ncompletely forgotten that it should be so used. But the passages above\r\nquoted from the 'Mirabilibus' and Diodorus show that in the first\r\nand fifth centuries B.C. nothing was known of their origin by these\r\nauthors, and no other has ventured to hint at their age. In classical\r\ntimes they seem to have been as mysterious as they are now:--\r\n\r\n  \"In the glimmer of the dawn\r\n  They stand the solemn silent witnesses\r\n  Of ancient days,--altars--or graves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBALEARIC ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe third group of monuments indicated above are the Talyots of Minorca\r\nand Majorca. Unfortunately our guide, De la Marmora, deserts us here.\r\nHe went to explore them, but ill health and other adverse circumstances\r\nprevented his carrying his intent fully into effect, and we are left\r\nconsequently very much to the work of Don Juan Ramis,[505] which is the\r\nreverse of satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 189. Talyot at Trepucò, Minorca. From De la Marmora.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 190. Talyot at Alajor, Minorca. From De la Marmora.]\r\n\r\nExternally they generally resemble the nurhags in appearance, and\r\napparently have always chambers in their interior, but De la\r\nMarmora was unable to determine whether any of them had the internal\r\nstaircase[506] leading to the summit which is the invariable and\r\nessential characteristic of the nurhag. If they had not this, they\r\nmust be considered as more nearly approaching to our chambered cairns\r\nthan to nurhags; and till this point is settled, and we know more\r\nabout them, we must refrain from speculations on the subject. One\r\ncharacteristic feature they have, however, which it is useful to note.\r\nIt is a bilithon, if such a term is admissible--an upright flat stone,\r\nwith one across it forming a sort of table. In appearance it very much\r\nresembles those stone tables which are found inside the chambers of the\r\nMaltese sepulchres, but these are always larger, and placed, so far as\r\nis known, externally. What their use may have been, it is difficult\r\nto conjecture, but they were evidently considered important here, as\r\nin woodcut No. 190 one is shown surrounded by a sacred enclosure,\r\nas if being itself the \"Numen\" to be honoured. At Malta, as before\r\nremarked, they certainly were not altars, because pedestals, which were\r\nunmistakably altars, are found in the same apartments, and they are\r\nvery unlike them. They seem more like the great saucers in the Irish\r\ntombs, and may have served the same purposes; but altogether these\r\nBalearic outside tables are unlike anything we know of elsewhere.\r\n\r\nRude-Stone circles seem to be not uncommon in combination with the\r\ntalyots and tall altars, and on the whole they seem to bear as much\r\naffinity to the monuments of Spain as to those of Sardinia, but again\r\ntill we know more it is idle to speculate on either their age or uses\r\nbeyond the conclusion drawn from all similar monuments--that their\r\ndestination was to honour departed greatness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be not only interesting but instructive to pursue the subject\r\nfurther, for the monuments of these islands deserve a more complete\r\ninvestigation than they have yet received; but this is not the place to\r\npursue it. Indeed, it is only indirectly that they have any connection\r\nwith the subject of this work. They are not megalithic in the sense in\r\nwhich the word is generally used. Nor are they rude, for all the stones\r\nare more or less shaped by art, and all are used constructively. In\r\nnone of them is the stone itself the object and end of the erection. In\r\nall it is only a means to an end.\r\n\r\nIt is their locality and their age that import them into our argument\r\nif there is anything in the connection between the monuments of France\r\nand Algeria, as attempted to be shown above. Whether the African ones\r\ncame from Europe, or _vice versâ_, it must have been in consequence\r\nof long-continued intercourse between the two countries, and of\r\nan influence of the dolmen builders in the Western Mediterranean\r\nwhich could hardly have failed to leave traces in the intermediate\r\nislands, unless they had been previously civilized and had fixed and\r\nlong-established modes of dealing with their own dead.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the nurhags and giants' towers extend back to the\r\nmythic times of Grecian history, say the war of Troy--and some of\r\nthem can hardly be more modern--it will hardly be contended now that\r\nthe dolmens are earlier. If they were so, it must be by centuries\r\nor by thousands of years, if we are to assume that the one had any\r\ninfluence on the other, for it must have taken long before a truly\r\nrude-stone monument could have grown into a constructive style like\r\nthat of Sardinia or Malta; and I do not think, after what has been\r\nsaid above, any one would now contend for so remote an antiquity. If\r\nneither anterior nor coeval, the conclusion, if we admit any influence\r\nat all, seems inevitable that the dolmens must be subsequent. But this\r\nis just the point at issue. The nurhags did not grow out of dolmens,\r\nnor dolmens out of nurhags. They are separate and distinct creations,\r\nso far as we know, belonging to different races, and practically\r\nuninfluenced by one another. Here, as elsewhere, each group must be\r\njudged by itself, and stand on its own merits. If any direct influence\r\ncan be shown to exist between any two groups, there is generally very\r\nlittle difficulty in arranging them in a sequence and seeing which is\r\nthe oldest, but till such connection is established, all such attempts\r\nare futile.\r\n\r\nIn so far as any argument can now be got out of these insular\r\nmonuments, it seems to take this form. If the dolmen people were\r\nearlier than the nurhag-builders, they certainly would have occupied\r\nthe islands that lay in their path between France or Spain and Africa,\r\nand we should find traces of them there. If, on the contrary, the\r\nnurhag-builders were the earlier race, and colonised these islands\r\nso completely as to fill them before the age of the dolmen-builders,\r\nthe latter, in passing from north to south, or _vice versâ_, could\r\nonly have touched at the islands as emigrants or traders, and not as\r\ncolonists, and consequently could have neither altered nor influenced\r\nto any great extent the more practically civilized people who had\r\nalready occupied them.\r\n\r\nSo far as we can see, this is the view that most nearly meets the\r\nfacts of the case at present known, and in this respect their negative\r\nevidence is both interesting and instructive, though, except when\r\nviewed in this light, the monuments of the Mediterranean islands have\r\nno real place in a work treating on rude-stone monuments.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 487: 'Voyage pittoresque en Sicile et Malte,' 4 vols.\r\n    folio, Paris, 1787.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 488: _Ibid._ pl. ccxli.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 489: The three formed part of a set of\r\n    nine, a duplicate of which has kindly\r\n    been lent to me by Mr. Frere, of Roydon\r\n    Hall, Norfolk.

Before, however, retailing what\r\nlittle we know about the monuments actually existing, it is necessary\r\nin this instance to say a few words about those which we know of only\r\nby hearsay. All writers on megalithic remains in the last century, and\r\nsome of those of the present, have made so much of the stones set up by\r\nAbraham and Joshua that it is indispensable to try to ascertain what\r\nthey were, and what bearing they really have on the subject of which we\r\nare treating.\r\n\r\nThe earliest mention of a stone being set up anywhere as a monument or\r\nmemorial is that of the one which Jacob used as a pillow in the night\r\nwhen he had that dream which became the title of the Israelites to the\r\nland of Canaan. \"And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the\r\nstone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and\r\npoured oil upon the top of it.\"[507] The question is, What was the size\r\nof this stone? In the East, where hard pillows are not objected to,\r\nnatives generally use a brick for this purpose. Europeans, who are more\r\nstiffnecked as well as more luxurious, insist on two bricks, and these\r\nlaid one on the other, with a cloth thrown over them, form by no means\r\nan uncomfortable headpiece. The fact of Jacob being alone, and moving\r\nthe stone to and from the place where it was used, proves that it was\r\nnot larger than, probably not so large as, the head that was laid\r\nupon it. It certainly, therefore, was neither the Lia Fail which still\r\nadorns the hill of Tara nor even the Scone stone that forms the king's\r\nseat in Westminster Abbey, and, what is more to our present purpose, it\r\nmay safely be discharged from the category of megalithic monuments of\r\nwhich we are now treating.\r\n\r\nThe next case in which stones are mentioned is in Genesis xxxi. 45 and\r\n46: \"And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. And Jacob\r\nsaid unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made\r\nan heap: and they did eat there upon the heap.\" This is not quite so\r\nclear; but the fair inference seems to be that what they erected was\r\na stone altar, on which they partook of an offering, which, under the\r\ncircumstances, took the form of a sacramental oath--one party standing\r\non either side of it. The altar in the temple of Jerusalem, we know,\r\ndown even to the time of Herod, was formed of stones, which no iron\r\ntool had ever touched,[508] and the tradition derived from this altar\r\nof Jacob seems to have lasted during the whole Jewish period. So there\r\nis nothing in this instance to lead us to suppose that \"the heap\" had\r\nany connection with the megalithic monuments of other countries.\r\n\r\nThe third instance, though more frequently quoted, seems even less\r\nrelevant. When Joshua passed the Jordan, twelve men, according to the\r\nnumber of the tribes, were appointed, each \"to take up a stone on\r\nhis shoulder out of the Jordan, in the place where the priests' feet\r\nhad stood, and to carry them and set them down at the place where\r\nthey lodged that night, as a memorial to the children of Israel for\r\never.\"[509] Here, again, stones that men can carry on their shoulders\r\nare not much bigger than their heads, and are not such as in any\r\nordinary sense would be used as memorials, inasmuch as they could be as\r\neasily removed by any one, as placed where they were. If ranged on an\r\naltar, in a building, this purpose would have been answered; but as an\r\nopen-air testimonial such stones seem singularly inappropriate.\r\n\r\nThe only instance in which it seems that the Bible is speaking of the\r\nsame class of monuments as those we are concerned with is in the\r\nlast chapter of Joshua, where it is said (verse 26), he \"took a great\r\nstone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of\r\nthe Lord,\" and said, \"Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us.\"\r\nIt is the more probable that this was really a great monolith, as it\r\nseems to be the stone mentioned in Judges ix. 6 as \"the pillar of the\r\nplain,\" ... or \"by the oak of the pillar which was in Shechem;\" and if\r\nthis is so, it must have been of considerable dimensions. It therefore\r\nalone, of all the stones mentioned in the Bible, seems to belong to the\r\nclass of stones we are treating of; but even then its direct bearing\r\non the subject is not clear. It by no means follows that because the\r\nIsraelites in Joshua's time set up such a stone for such a purpose that\r\neither then or a thousand years afterwards the French or Scandinavians\r\ndid the same thing with the same intention. It may be so, but both\r\nthe time and locality seem too remote for us to rely on any supposed\r\nanalogy.\r\n\r\nAs bearing indirectly on this subject, it is curious to observe that\r\nthe rite of circumcision in these early days of Jewish history was\r\nperformed with flint knives,[510] which, considering that bronze and\r\niron were both familiarly known to the Israelites at that period, is a\r\nremarkable example of the persistence in an old fashion long after it\r\nmight have been supposed it would have become obsolete. It is equally\r\ncurious, if the Septuagint is to be depended upon, that they should\r\nhave buried with Joshua in his grave those very flint implements (τὰς\r\nμαχαίραγς τὰς πετρίνας) with which the operation was performed. This\r\ncannot of course be quoted as the latest or even a late example of\r\nflint being buried in tombs, but it is interesting as explaining one\r\nreason for the practice. It is at least one instance in which flint was\r\nused long after metal was known, and one tomb in which stone implements\r\nwere buried for other reasons than the people's ignorance of the use of\r\nmetal.[511] If the Jews used flints for that purpose in Joshua's time,\r\nand so disposed of them after the death of their chief, the only wonder\r\nis that they do not do so at the present day.\r\n\r\nTo turn from these speculations, based on words, to the real facts\r\nof the case. We find that the first persons who observed dolmens in\r\nSyria were Captains Irby and Mangles. In their hurried journey from Es\r\nSalt, in 1817, to the fords of the Jordan, apparently in a straight\r\nline from Es Salt to Nablous, they observed a group of twenty-seven\r\ndolmens, very irregularly situated at the foot of the mountain. All\r\nthose they observed were composed of two side-stones, from 8 to 10 feet\r\nlong, supporting a cap-stone projecting considerably beyond the sides\r\nand ends. The chambers, however, were only 5 feet long internally--too\r\nshort, consequently, for a body to be stretched out at full length.\r\nThe contraction arose from the two transverse stones being placed\r\nconsiderably within the ends of the side-stones. One of these appears\r\nto have been solid, the other to have been pierced with what is called\r\na door; but whether this was a hole in one stone, or a door formed by\r\ntwo jambs, is not clear.[512] No drawing or plan accompanies their\r\ndescription; but the arrangement will be easily understood when we come\r\nto examine those of Rajunkoloor, in India,[513] described farther on\r\n(woodcut No. 206).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 191. Dolmens at Kafr er Wâl. From a sketch by Mrs.\r\nRoberton Blaine.]\r\n\r\nThe only other reliable information I have is extracted for me from\r\nhis note-books by my friend, Mr. D. R. Blaine. In travelling from Om\r\nKeis--Gadara--towards Gerash, at a place called Kafr er Wâl, not far\r\nfrom Tibné, they met with one considerable group, a portion of which\r\nis represented in the above woodcut (No. 191). The size of the stones\r\nvaries considerably; generally, however, they are about 12 feet by 6\r\nfeet, and from 1 to 2 feet in thickness. One cap-stone was nearly 12\r\nfeet square, and the side-stones vary from 5 to 6 feet in height. On\r\napproaching Sûf, a great number of dolmens were observed on either side\r\nof the road for a distance of from three to four miles. Some of these\r\nseemed quite perfect, others were broken down; but the travellers had\r\nunfortunately no time to count or examine them with care.\r\n\r\nThis is a very meagre account of a great subject--so meagre, indeed,\r\nthat it is impossible to found any argument upon it that will be worth\r\nanything; but it is interesting to observe that all the dolmens as yet\r\nnoticed in Syria are situated in Gilead, the country of the Amorites,\r\nand of Og, king of Bashan. If it should prove eventually that there are\r\nnone except in this district, it would give rise to several interesting\r\nethnographical determinations. At present all we can feel confident\r\nabout is that there are no dolmens west of the Jordan; but the Amorites\r\nwere originally settled in Hebron,[514] and there are certainly no\r\ndolmens there. So unless they migrated eastward before the dolmen\r\nperiod, they can scarcely lay claim to them. Then these dolmens may\r\nbelong to the Rephaim, the Emim, the Anakim, the Zuzim, and all those\r\ngiant tribes that dwelt beyond Jordan at the time of Chedorlaomer,\r\nthe dreaded king of Elam, who smote the kings of this district at the\r\ndawn of the Bible history of these regions.[515] The speculation is\r\na tempting one, and if it should eventually be proved that they are\r\nconfined to this one district, it will no doubt find favour in some\r\nquarters. There seems, however, nothing to support it beyond the fact\r\nthat the people in the region beyond the Jordan seem all and always to\r\nhave been of Hamite or Turanian blood, and therefore likely to adopt\r\nthis mode of burial whenever it may have been introduced, in spite of\r\nthe colonization of two tribes and a half of Israelites, who could do\r\nbut little to leaven the mass. I am afraid that, like the theory which\r\nidentified the Roman cities of the Hauran with the giant cities of Og,\r\nking of Bashan, and his tall contemporaries, this hypothesis will not\r\nbear examination. Every stone of these cities, it is now known, was\r\nplaced where we now find it, after the time when Pompey extended Roman\r\ninfluence to these regions; and nothing would surprise me less than\r\nto find that these dolmens are even more modern. Before, however, we\r\nventure to speculate on such a subject, we must feel surer than we now\r\ndo of their extent and their distribution, and know something of their\r\ncontents. On both these subjects we are at present practically entirely\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGilead is almost the last safe resting-place at which we can pause in\r\nour explorations eastward in our attempts to connect the Eastern and\r\nthe Western dolmen regions together. But Gilead is two thousand miles\r\nfrom Peshawur, where we meet the first example of the Indian dolmens;\r\nand in the vast regions that lie between, only one or two doubtful\r\nexamples are known to exist. We can creep on doubtfully a couple of\r\nhundred miles nearer, in Arabia and Circassia; but that hardly helps\r\nus much, and unless some discoveries are made in the intermediate\r\ncountries, the migration theory will become wholly untenable.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the recent ordnance survey of the peninsula of Sinai\r\nin 1868-9, great numbers of circular buildings were discovered, many of\r\nwhich were certainly tombs; and plans and drawings of some of them have\r\nbeen engraved, and will be published by the authorities at Southampton.\r\nBut as great bodies move slowly, it may yet be a long time before they\r\nare accessible to the public. Meanwhile the following particulars,\r\ngleaned from a paper by the Rev. Mr. Holland,[516] will suffice to\r\nexplain what they are. The buildings are of two classes: the first,\r\nwhich were probably store-houses, were built in the shape of a dome,\r\nabout 5 feet high and 5 or 6 feet in diameter in the interior. The\r\nwalls were often as much as 4 feet thick, and a large flat stone formed\r\nthe highest portion of the roof, which appeared to have been covered\r\nwith loose shingle. They had no windows, and one door, about 3 feet\r\nhigh and 1½ foot broad. The stones used in their construction were\r\noften large, but never dressed, and no mortar was used.\r\n\r\nThe other kind of ruins, which is generally found in close proximity\r\nto the former, often in separate groups, consists of massively built\r\ncircles of stones, of about 14 to 15 feet in diameter, and 3 feet\r\nhigh, but without any roof. \"These,\" Mr. Holland says, \"were evidently\r\ntombs; for I found human bones in all that I opened,\" which were\r\nnever met with in the buildings of the first class; \"and in one two\r\nskeletons lying side by side, one of them on a bed of flat stones.\r\nThe rings of stones were apparently first half filled with earth; the\r\nbodies were then laid in them, and they were then quite filled up with\r\nearth, and heavy stones placed on the top to prevent the wild beasts\r\ndisturbing the bodies. Some of these rings are of much larger size:\r\nsome 45, others 90, feet in diameter, and some contained a smaller\r\nring in the centre. Near the mound of Nukb Hawy is one no less than\r\n375 feet in diameter.\" From the above description it is evident that,\r\nexcept from the dimensions of the last-mentioned, these circles have\r\nmuch more affinity with the Chouchas and Bazinas of Algeria than with\r\nanything farther north or west, and there is probably some connection\r\nbetween them. But a wall of coursed masonry of small stones can hardly\r\nbe compared with our megalithic structures, and, so far as is known,\r\nno dolmens, nor any examples of the great rude-stone monuments we are\r\ndiscussing, have been found in the peninsula. When the results of the\r\nsurvey are published, we may see reason to alter this opinion; but\r\nat present these Sinaitic tombs seem to belong to a class altogether\r\ndifferent from the European examples, except in two points--that they\r\nare circular and sepulchral. These characteristics are, however, so\r\nimportant that eventually other points of comparison may be established.\r\n\r\nThe rude-stone monuments which Mr. Giffard Palgrave accidentally\r\nstumbled upon in the centre of Arabia are of a very different class\r\nfrom these. According to his account, what he saw was apparently\r\none-half of what had once been a complete circle of trilithons; but\r\nwhether continuous, like the outer circle of Stonehenge, or in pairs,\r\nlike the inner circle there, is not quite clear. As he could just\r\ntouch the impost with his whip when on his camel, the height was, as\r\nhe says, about 15 feet--the same as Stonehenge; and the expression he\r\nuses would lead us to suppose that the whole structure was essentially\r\nsimilar. Allowance, however, must be made for his being in disguise,\r\nwhich prevented his making notes or writing down his observations; and\r\nwriting afterwards from memory, his description may not be minutely\r\ncorrect. He is, however, so clear and acute an observer that he could\r\nhardly be deceiving himself; and we may take it for granted that\r\nexactly halfway between the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, near Eyoon,\r\nin latitude 26° 20´, there exist three rude-stone monuments--he saw\r\nonly one, but heard of two others--of a class similar to those found\r\nin England and in the continent of Europe,[517] and what is more\r\nimportant to our present purpose, similar to those found in Tripoli,\r\nand illustrated above in woodcuts 175 and 176.\r\n\r\nDe Voguë's plates of late Roman tombs in the Hauran, especially those\r\nrepresented in his plates 93 and 94,[518] take away all improbability\r\nfrom the idea that trilithons should have been erected for sepulchral\r\npurposes in this part of the world. That the one form is copied from\r\nthe other may be assumed as certain; but whether the rude stones\r\nare anterior to or contemporary with or subsequent to those of the\r\nRoman order, every one must decide for himself. I believe them to be\r\neither coeval or more modern, but there is nothing in these particular\r\nmonuments to guide us to a decision either way. If we could fancy that\r\nthe savages who now occupy that country would ever allow it to be\r\nexplored, it would be extremely interesting to know more of the Arabian\r\nexamples, even if they should only prove to be an extension of Syrian\r\nor North African forms into Central Arabia. If, on the other hand, a\r\nmigration theory is ever to be established, this probably would be the\r\nsouthern route, or at least one of the southern routes; though the\r\nimagination staggers when we come to consider how long it must have\r\nbeen ago since any wandering tribes passed through Central Arabia on\r\ntheir way westward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAre there any dolmens in Asia Minor? It is no answer to this question\r\nto say that none have been seen by any of the numerous travellers who\r\nhave traversed that country. Ten years ago, by a parity of reasoning,\r\ntheir existence in Algeria or in Syria might have been denied. My\r\nimpression is that they will not be found in that region. I expect that\r\nAsia Minor was too completely civilized in a pre-dolmen period to have\r\nadopted this form afterwards; but it is dangerous to speculate about a\r\ncountry of whose early history, as well as of whose modern geography,\r\nwe really know so little.\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely interesting, however, if some traveller would\r\nopen his eyes, and tell us what really is to be found there, as it\r\nwould throw considerable light on some interesting problems connected\r\nwith this subject. It would, for instance, be interesting to know\r\nwhether there are or are not dolmens in Galatia. If there are, it would\r\ngo far to assist the Celtic claim to their invention. If they do not\r\nexist, either the Celts must be asked to waive their claim or we must\r\nfind out some other mode of accounting for their absence.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, it would be interesting to know if there are dolmens in\r\nLydia. As mentioned before, there are numberless chambered tumuli in\r\nthat country, and it would be curious to trace the existence or absence\r\nof any connection between these two forms of sepulchres. My impression\r\nis that the case of Lydia is very similar to that of Etruria. It was\r\ncivilized before the dolmen era, and it will consequently be in vain to\r\nlook there for any megalithic remains. The chambers in all the tombs\r\nyet opened are, so far as we at present know, constructed of small\r\nstones, and show no reminiscence of a rude-stone stage of art.[519]\r\n\r\nWhen we cross the Black Sea to Kertch, we find a state of affairs\r\nvery similar to that in Lydia--great numbers of chambered tumuli,\r\nbut all of microlithic or masonic forms. The tombs seem to be the\r\nlineal descendants of those at Mycenæ, and to belong to a totally\r\ndifferent class from those we are treating of, and, notwithstanding\r\ntheir similarity of purpose, have apparently sprung from a different\r\nsource. Yet it is curious to observe that even here the inevitable\r\nflints reappear. In one tomb, known as Kouloba, or Hill of Cinders,\r\nwere found the remains of a chief, with his wife, their servants, and a\r\nhorse. He wore a cap ornamented with gold, a gold enamelled necklace,\r\nand gold bracelets, and his sword was of iron. An electrum plate, which\r\nhad formed part of a quiver, was ornamented with figures of animals\r\nand inscribed with the Greek word Πὁναχο. The queen's ornaments were\r\nricher in metal and more elaborate in workmanship than her husband's,\r\nyet among all this magnificence were found a quantity of flakes and\r\nother implements of flint:[520] a tolerably convincing proof that flint\r\nimplements were not buried in this tomb, any more than in Joshua's,\r\nbecause men did not know the use of metals, but for some symbolical\r\nreason we do not now understand. There is little doubt that other\r\nexamples as striking as these will be found when looked for, and, at\r\nall events, these do away with all _à priori_ arguments based on the\r\nprobability or otherwise of their being modern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 192. Holed Dolmen. From Dubois de Montpereux.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 193. Holed Dolmen, Circassia. From a drawing by Simpson.]\r\n\r\nCombined with these are found, very sparsely on the shore of the\r\nCrimea, but frequently on the eastern shore of the Baltic and in\r\nCircassia, the forms of dolmens we are familiar with in other parts\r\nof the world. Nothing like a regular survey of them has yet been\r\nattempted, nor have we any detailed accounts of them; but from such\r\ninformation as is published,[521] the general type seems to be that of\r\nthe holed dolmen, such as those represented in the annexed woodcuts.\r\n\r\nAs far as can be judged from such illustrations as have been published,\r\nall the Caucasian or Circassian dolmens are composed of stones more\r\nor less hewn and shaped and carefully fitted together, giving them a\r\nmore modern appearance than their Western congeners. That, however,\r\nmay be owing to other circumstances than age, and cannot be used as\r\nan argument either way till we know more about them. It would be\r\nextremely interesting if some one would make a special study of this\r\ngroup, as Circassia lies exactly halfway between India and Scandinavia,\r\nand if we adopt a migration theory, this is exactly the central\r\nresting-place where we would expect to find traces of the passage of\r\nthe dolmen-builders. Their route probably would be through Bactria,\r\ndown the Oxus to the Caspian, across Circassia, and round the head of\r\nthe Sea of Azof to the Dnieper, and up that river and down the banks of\r\nthe Niemen or Vistula to the Baltic.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we adopt a missionary theory, and are content\r\nto believe in an Eastern influence only, without insisting on a great\r\ndisplacement of peoples, this would equally be the trade route along\r\nwhich such influence might be supposed to extend, and so connect\r\nthe north with the east, just as we may suppose a southern route to\r\nhave extended through Arabia and Syria to the southern shores of the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 194. Baba. From Dubois de Montpereux.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 195. Four-cornered Grave. From Sjöborg.]\r\n\r\nEven more important for our present purpose, however, than an\r\nexamination of these Caucasian regions would be an exploration of the\r\nSteppes to the northward of the route just indicated. If there is any\r\nfoundation for the theory that the dolmens are of Turanian origin, it\r\nis here that we should expect to find the germs of the system. It is\r\none of the best-established facts of ethnology that the original seat\r\nof the Aryans was somewhere in Upper and Central Asia, whence they\r\nmigrated eastward into India, southward into Persia, and westward into\r\nEurope. In like manner, the original seat of the Turanians is assumed\r\nto be somewhat farther north, and thence at an earlier period it is\r\nbelieved that they spread themselves at some very early prehistoric\r\ntime over the whole face of the Old World. When we turn to the Steppes,\r\nwhence this great family of mankind are supposed to have migrated,\r\nwe find it covered with tumuli. As Haxthausen[522] expresses it, the\r\nKurgans, as they are there called, are counted \"non par des milliers,\r\nc'est centaines de milliers qu'il faudrait dire;\" and Pallas equally\r\ngives an account of their astonishing numbers.[523] These tumuli\r\nresemble exactly our barrows, such as are seen on Salisbury plain,\r\nexcept that they are generally of very much larger dimensions, and\r\nthey have one peculiarity not known elsewhere. On the top of each is\r\nan upright stone, rudely carved, but always unmistakably representing\r\na human figure, and understood to be intended for a representation of\r\nthe person buried beneath. Pallas, Haxthausen, and Dubois, all give\r\nrepresentations of these figures, but in some instances at least they\r\nare repetitions of the same original. They are perfectly described\r\nby the monk Ruberquis, who visited these countries in 1253. \"The\r\nComanians,\" he says, \"build a great tomb over their dead, and erect\r\nan image of the dead party thereon, with his face towards the east,\r\nholding a drinking-cup in his hand before his navel. They also erect\r\non the monuments of rich men pyramids, that is to say, little pointed\r\nhouses or pinnacles. In some places I saw mighty towers, made of brick,\r\nand in other places pyramids made of stones, though no stones are found\r\nthereabouts. I saw one newly buried in whose behalf they hanged up\r\nsixteen horse-hides, and they set beside his grave Cosmos (Kumiss) to\r\ndrink and flesh to eat, and yet they say he was baptized. And I beheld\r\nother kinds of sepulchres, also towards the east, namely, large floors\r\nor pavements made of stone, some round and some square; and then four\r\nlong stones, pitched upright above the said pavement, towards the four\r\nregions of the world.\"[524] The general correctness of this account is\r\nso fully confirmed by more modern travellers that there seems no reason\r\nfor doubting it; but, as no one has described these \"pavements,\" we\r\ndare not rely too much on their manifest similarity to the Scandinavian\r\nsquare and round graves, with four angle-stones, like the preceding\r\none (woodcut No. 195).\r\n\r\nIt may not be satisfactory to be obliged to go back to a traveller of\r\nthe thirteenth century, however much he may be confirmed by subsequent\r\nwriters, for an account of monuments which we would like to see\r\nmeasured and drawn with modern accuracy. It is, on the other hand,\r\nhowever, a gain to find a trustworthy witness who lived among a people\r\nwho buried their dead in tumuli and sacrificed horses in their honour,\r\nand provided them with meat and drink for their journey to the Shades;\r\nwho, in fact, in the thirteenth century were enacting those things as\r\nliving men which we find only in a fossil state in more Western lands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 196. Tumulus at Alexandropol.]\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of these tumuli may be judged of by one of the\r\nmost magnificent recently excavated by the Russians near Alexandropol,\r\nbetween the Dnieper and the Bazaolouk. It is about 1000 feet in\r\ncircumference and 70 feet high, and was originally surmounted by a\r\n\"Baba,\" which, however, is not there now. Around its base was a sort\r\nof retaining wall of small stones, and outside these a ditch and low\r\nmound, but no attempt whatever at lithic magnificence. Within it were\r\nseveral sepulchres. The principal one in the centre had apparently\r\nbeen already rifled, but in the subsidiary ones great quantities of\r\ngold ornaments were found, especially on the trappings of the horses\r\nwhich seem to have been buried here almost with more honour than\r\ntheir masters. Judging from the form of the ornaments and the style\r\nof the workmanship, the tomb belonged to the third or fourth century\r\nB.C.[525]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 197. Uncovered Base of a Tumulus at Nikolajew.]\r\n\r\nIn Haxthausen's work[526] there is a woodcut which may give us a hint\r\nas to the genesis of circles. A kurgan, or tumulus, at Nikolajew, in\r\nthe government of Cherson, was cleared away, and though nothing was\r\nfound in it to indicate its age and purpose, its base was composed of\r\nthree or four concentric circles of upright stones, surrounding what\r\nappears to be a tomb composed of five stones in the centre. Similar\r\narrangements have been found in Algerian tumuli, and it looks as if\r\nthe first hint of a sepulchral circle may have arisen from such an\r\narrangement having become familiar before being covered up, just as I\r\nbelieve the free-standing dolmen arose from the uncovered cist having\r\nexcited such admiration as to make its framers unwilling to hide it.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear to me to admit of doubt that there is a connexion,\r\nand an intimate one, between these Scythian or Tartar tombs and those\r\nof Europe; but the steps by which the one grew out of the other, and\r\nthe time when it took place, can only be determined when we have\r\nmore certain information regarding them than we now possess. It is\r\nimportant, however, to observe that, if they are the original models\r\nor congeners of the tumuli of the Western world, they are not of the\r\ndolmens or circles, except in such an indirect way as in the last\r\nexample quoted from Haxthausen; nor are they of our menhirs, for all\r\nthe stones we know of are carved as completely as the babas (woodcut\r\nNo. 194); and we know literally of no rude stones connected with them,\r\nnor do we find any attempt in Scythia to produce effect by masses in\r\nunhewn stone, which is the fundamental idea that governed their use in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 198. Circle near Peshawur. From a photograph.]\r\n\r\nWe tread on surer ground when we reach the Caubul valley, not that\r\nmany proofs of it have yet been published, but the quantity of tumuli,\r\ntopes, and similar monuments,[527] render it certain that circles and\r\ndolmens will be found there when looked for. Only one typical example\r\nhas been published, but Sir Arthur Phayre, to whom we owe it, heard\r\nof other similar monuments existing in the neighbourhood. Fourteen of\r\nthe stones composing this circle are still standing, and the tallest\r\nare about 11 feet in height, but others are lying on the ground more\r\nor less broken. The circle is about 50 feet in diameter, and there are\r\nappearances of an outer circle of smaller stones at a distance of about\r\n50 to 60 feet from the inner one. The natives have no tradition about\r\nits erection, except the same myth which we find in Somersetshire, that\r\na wedding party, passing over the plain, were turned into stone by some\r\npowerful magician.[528]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 199. Circle at Deb Ayeh, near Darabgerd.]\r\n\r\nAt present, these Eusufzaie circles, and those described by Sir\r\nWilliam Ouseley at Deli Ayeh,[529] are almost the only examples we\r\nhave to bridge over the immense gulf that exists between the Eastern\r\nand Western dolmen regions. Even the last, however, is only a frail\r\nprop for a theory, inasmuch as we have only a drawing of it by Sir\r\nW. Ouseley, who, in his description, says: \"I can scarcely think the\r\narrangement of these stones wholly, though it may be partly, natural\r\nor accidental.\" Coupled with the stone represented as figure 13 on\r\nthe same plate, in Sir William Ouseley's work, I feel no doubt about\r\nthese belonging to the class of rude-stone monuments, but we must\r\nknow of more examples and more about them before we can reason with\r\nconfidence regarding them. Another example, which certainly appears to\r\nbe artificial, is recorded by Chardin. In travelling between Tabriz\r\nand Miana, he observed on his left hand several circles of hewn\r\nstones, which his companions informed him had been placed there by the\r\nCaous--the giants of the Kaianian dynasty. \"The stones,\" he remarks,\r\n\"are so large, that eight men could hardly move one of them, yet they\r\nmust have been brought from quarries in the hills, the nearest of which\r\nis twenty miles distant.\"[530] Numerous travellers must have passed\r\nthat way since, but no one has observed these stones. It does not,\r\nhowever, follow that they are not still there, and hundreds of others\r\nbesides; but while all this uncertainty prevails, it is obviously most\r\nunsafe to speculate on the manner in which any connexion may have taken\r\nplace. It may turn out that the intervening country is full of dolmens,\r\nor it may be that practically we know all that is to be learned on\r\nthe subject, but till this is ascertained, any theory that may be\r\nbroached must be open to correction, perhaps even to refutation. It is\r\nnot, however, either useless or out of place to make such suggestions\r\nas those contained in the last few pages. They turn attention to\r\nsubjects too liable to be overlooked, but which are capable of easy\r\nsolution when fairly examined, while their truth or falsehood does not\r\npractically in any essential degree affect the main argument. The age\r\nand uses of the Indian dolmens, as of the European examples, must be\r\ndetermined from the internal evidence they themselves afford. Each must\r\nstand or fall from its own strength or weakness. It would of course\r\nbe interesting if a connexion between the two can be established, and\r\nwe could trace the mode and time when it took place, but it is not\r\nnecessarily important. If anyone cares to insist that there was no\r\nconnexion between the two, he deprives himself of one of the principal\r\npoints of interest in the whole enquiry, but does not otherwise affect\r\nthe argument either as to their age or use. But of all this we shall be\r\nin a better position to judge when we have gone through the evidence\r\ndetailed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 507: Genesis xxviii. 18; xxxv. 14.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 508: Josephus, 'Bell.

Even irrespective,\r\nhowever, of these, the study of the history of architecture in India is\r\ncalculated to throw so much light on the problems connected with the\r\nstudy of megalithic monuments in the West that, for that cause alone it\r\ndeserves much more attention than it has hitherto received.\r\n\r\nNo one, it is presumed, will now be prepared to dispute the early\r\ncivilization at least of the northern parts of India. Whether the\r\nAryans crossed the Indus three thousand years B.C., as I\r\nbelieve, or two thousand B.C., as others contend, is of little\r\nconsequence to our present purposes. It is generally understood that\r\nthe Vedas were compiled or reduced to writing thirteen centuries before\r\nChrist, and the Laws of Menu seven or eight hundred years before our\r\nera, and these works betoken a civilization of some standing. Ayodia\r\nwas a great prosperous city at the time of the incidents described in\r\nthe Ramayana, and Hastinapura when the tragedy of the Mahabharata was\r\nbeing enacted; and these great events took place probably one or two\r\nthousand years before Christ, or between these two dates. Or to come a\r\nlittle nearer to our time, all the circumstances depicted in all the\r\nthousand and one legends connected with the life and teaching of Sakya\r\nMuni (623 to 543 B.C.), describe a country with cities and\r\npalaces, and possessing a very high state of civilization; and these\r\nlegends are so numerous and so consentaneous that they may fairly be\r\nconsidered, for this purpose at least, as rising to the dignity of\r\nhistory. Yet with all this we now know it for a fact that no stone\r\nbuilding or monument of stone now exists in India that was erected\r\nbefore the time of Asoka, B.C. 250. But, besides negative\r\nproof, we have in the early caves, 150 to 200 B.C., such\r\nmanifest proofs of the stone architecture being then a mere transcript\r\nof wooden forms that we know certainly that we have here reached the\r\nvery _incunabula_ of a style. Of course it does not follow from this\r\nthat the cities before this time may not have been splendid or the\r\npalaces magnificent. In Burmah and Siam the palaces and monasteries\r\nare either wholly or mostly in wood, and these timber erections are\r\ncertainly more gorgeous and quite as expensive as the stone buildings\r\nof the West, and the Indians seem to have been content with this less\r\ndurable style of architecture till the influence of the Bactrian Greeks\r\ninduced them to adopt the clumsier but more durable material of stone\r\nfor their buildings.\r\n\r\nWith such an example before us, ought we to be surprised if the rude\r\ninhabitants of Europe were content with earth and the forms into which\r\nit could be shaped, till the example of the Romans taught them the\r\nuse of the more durable and more strongly accentuated material? Nor\r\nwill it do to contend that, if our forefathers got this hint from the\r\nRomans, they would have adopted the Roman style of architecture with\r\nit. The Indians certainly did not do so. Their early attempts at stone\r\narchitecture are wooden, in the strictest sense, and retained their\r\nwooden forms for two or three centuries almost unchanged, and when\r\ngradually they became more and more appropriate to the newly adopted\r\nmaterial, it was not Greek or foreign forms that they adopted, but\r\nforms of their own native invention. In Asoka's reign we have Greek or\r\nrather Assyrian ornaments in one of his lâts,[531] and something like\r\na Persepolitan capital in some of the earlier caves,[532] but these\r\ndied out, and it is not till after five centuries that we really find\r\nanything like the arts of Bactria at Amravati.[533] As the civilized\r\nrace copied their own wooden forms with all the elaborateness of which\r\nwood carving is capable, so the rude race seems to have used the forms\r\nwhich were appropriate to their status, and which were the only forms\r\nthey could appreciate.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of Indian architecture is worth pointing out here\r\nas tending to modify one of the most generally received dogmas of\r\nWestern criticism. In speaking of such monuments as New Grange or the\r\ntombs at Locmariaker, which are roofed by overlapping stones forming\r\nwhat is technically called a horizontal arch, it is usual to assume\r\nthat this must have been done before the invention of the Roman or\r\nradiating arch form. So far as Indian experience goes, this assumption\r\nis by no means borne out. When Kutb u deen wished to signalise his\r\ntriumph over the idolaters, he, in 1206 A.D., employed the\r\nHindus to erect a mosque for him in his recently acquired capital of\r\nDelhi. In the centre of the screen forming the mosque, he designed a\r\ngreat archway 22 feet span, 53 feet in height, and formed as a pointed\r\narch of two sides of an equilateral spherical triangle. This was the\r\nusual form of Saracenic openings at Ghazni or Balkh in the beginning\r\nof the thirteenth century, but it was almost beyond the power of the\r\nHindus to construct it. They did so, however, and it still stands,\r\nthough crippled; but all the courses are horizontal, like their own\r\ndomes, except two long stones which form the apex of the arch.[534] In\r\na very few years after this time the Mahommedan conquerors had taught\r\nthe subject Hindus to build radiating arches, and every mosque or\r\nMahommedan building from that time forward is built with arches formed\r\nas we form them; but, except a very few in the reign of the cosmopolite\r\nAkbar, no single Hindu building or temple, even down to the present\r\ntime, has an arch in the sense in which we understand the word.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking instances of this peculiarity is found in the\r\nprovince of Guzerat. There are still to be seen the splendid ruins of\r\nthe city of Ahmedabad built by the Mahommedan kings of the province\r\nbetween the years 1411 and 1583.[535] There every mosque and every\r\nbuilding is arched or vaulted according to one system. In the same\r\nprovince stands the sacred city of Palitana, with its hundreds of\r\ntemples, some of a date as early as the eleventh, many built within\r\nthe limits of the present century, and some now in the course of\r\nconstruction; yet, so far as is known, there is not a single arch\r\nwithin the walls of the city. So it is throughout India: side by\r\nside stand the buildings of the two great sects--those belonging to\r\nthe Mahommedans universally arched, those belonging to the Hindus\r\nas certainly avoiding this form of construction. This is the more\r\nremarkable as the moment we cross the frontier of India we find the\r\narch universally prevalent in Burmah, as early certainly as the tenth\r\nor eleventh century, and in all the forms, round, pointed, and flat,\r\nwhich we use in the present day.[536] But if we extend our researches\r\na little farther east, we again come to a country full of the most\r\nwonderful buildings known to exist anywhere, with bridges and viaducts\r\nand vaults; but not one single arch has yet been discovered in the\r\nlength and breadth of the kingdom of Cambodia.\r\n\r\nAll this is no doubt very anomalous and strange, though, if it were\r\nworth while, some of it might be accounted for and explained. This,\r\nhowever, is not the place for doing so: all that is here required is to\r\npoint out the existence of the apparent anomaly, in order that we may\r\nnot too hurriedly jump to chronological conclusions from the existence\r\nor absence of arches in any given building.\r\n\r\nAnother most instructive lesson bearing on our present subject that is\r\nto be derived from the study of Indian antiquities will be found in\r\nthat curious but persistent juxtaposition that everywhere prevails of\r\nthe highest form of progressive civilization beside the lowest types of\r\nchangeless barbarism. Everywhere in India the past is the present, and\r\nthe present is the past; not, as is usually assumed, that the Hindu is\r\nimmutable--quite the contrary. When contemporary history first dawned\r\non us, India was Buddhist, and for eight or nine centuries that was the\r\nprevalent religion of the state. There is not now a single Buddhist\r\nestablishment in the length and breadth of the land. The religions\r\nwhich superseded Buddhism were then new, and have ever since been\r\nchanging, so that India now contains more religions and more numerous\r\nsects than any portion of the world of the same extent. Even within\r\nthe last six centuries one-fifth of the population have adopted the\r\nMahommedan religion, and are quite prepared to follow any new form of\r\nfaith that may be the fashion of the day. But beside all this never\r\nceasing change, there are tribes and races which remain immutable.\r\n\r\nTo take one instance among a hundred that might be adduced. Ougein\r\nwas a great commercial capital in the days of the Greek. It was the\r\nresidence of Asoka, 260 B.C.[537] It was the Ozene of the\r\nPeriplus, the capital of the great Vicramaditya in the middle of the\r\nfifth century,[538] and it was the city chosen by Jey Sing for the\r\nerection of one of his great observatories in the reign of Akbar. Yet\r\nalmost within sight of this city are to be found tribes of Bhils,\r\nliving now as they lived long before the Christian era. They are not\r\nagricultural, hardly pastoral, but live chiefly by the chase. With\r\ntheir bows and arrows they hunt the wild game as their forefathers did\r\nfrom time immemorial. They never cared to learn to read or write, and\r\nhave no literature of any sort, hardly any tradition. Yet the Bhil was\r\nthere before the Brahmin; and the proudest sovereign of Rajpootana\r\nacknowledges the Bhil as lord of the soil, and no new successor to\r\nthe throne considers his title as complete till he has received the\r\ntika at the hands of the nomad.[539] If India were a country divided\r\nby high mountain-ranges, or impenetrable forests, or did impassable\r\ndeserts anywhere exist, this co-existence of two forms of society might\r\nbe accounted for. But the contrary is the case. From the Himalayas to\r\nCape Comorin, no obstacle exists, nor, so far as we know, ever did\r\nexist, to the freest intercourse between the various races inhabiting\r\nthe country. If we may believe the traditions on which the epic of the\r\nRamayana was founded, armies traversed the length and the breadth of\r\nthe land one thousand, it may be two thousand, years before Christ.\r\nThe Brahmins carried their arms and their literature to the south at a\r\nvery early age. The Buddhists spread everywhere. The Jains succeeded\r\nthem. The Mahommedans conquered and settled in Mysore and the Carnatic,\r\nbut in vain. The Bhil, the Cole, the Gond, the Toda, and other tribes,\r\nremain as they were, and practise their own rites and follow the\r\ncustoms of their forefathers as if the stranger had never come among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nEASTERN INDIA.\r\n\r\nTo turn from these generalities to two instances more directly\r\nillustrative of our European experience. The first is that of the\r\nKhonds, the Druids of the East, worshipping in groves, _priscâ\r\nformidine sacris_, and indulging in human sacrifices and other\r\nunamiable practices of our forefathers.[540] These tribes exist partly\r\non a range of hills bounding the province of Cuttack on the western\r\nside and partly extend into the plains themselves. Almost within\r\ntheir boundaries there exists a low range of rocky hills known as\r\nthe Udyagiri, in which are found a series of Buddhist caves, many\r\nof them excavated before the Christian era, and as beautiful and as\r\ninteresting as any caves in India.[541] A little beyond this are seen\r\nthe great tower of the Bobaneswar temple and of the hundred and one\r\nsmaller fanes dedicated to the worship of Siva, which was established\r\nhere in all its splendour in the seventh century;[542] and a little\r\nfarther on, rises on the verge of the ocean the great tower of the\r\ntemple of Juggernaut, at Puri, established in the twelfth century for\r\nthe worship of that form of Vishnu.[543] Yet in defiance of all this,\r\nin close proximity to the shrines of the gentle ascetic who devoted\r\nhis life to the prevention of the shedding of the blood of the meanest\r\nof created beings, in sight of Bobaneswar and Puri, Macpherson tells\r\nus, unconsciously almost repeating the words of Tacitus[544]: \"The\r\nKhonds use neither temples nor images in their worship. They cannot\r\ncomprehend and regard as absurd the idea of building a house in honour\r\nof a deity, or in the expectation that he will be peculiarly present\r\nin any place resembling a human habitation. Groves kept sacred from\r\nthe axe, hoar rocks, the tops of hills, fountains, and the banks of\r\nstreams, are in their eyes the fittest places for worship.\" It was in\r\nthese sacred and venerable groves, that annually human victims were\r\noffered up to appease the wrath of the dreaded Tari, and to procure\r\nfertility for the fields. In 1836 we first interfered to put a stop to\r\nthis, and before the Mutiny believed we had been successful. Perhaps\r\nwe may have been so, but if our strong repressive hand were once\r\nremoved, it cannot be doubted but the sacrifices would be instantly\r\nresumed. What the Buddhists and the Brahmins, working during at least\r\ntwo thousand years, have failed to accomplish, we strangers cannot\r\nexpect to succeed in, in a few years, unless indeed we adopt the system\r\nfollowed by our forefathers, and are determined on extirpating those\r\nwho obstinately adhere to such practices. Had it not been that first\r\nthe Roman, and then the Celt, by sword and cord set vigorously to\r\nimprove the older race, we might now have human sacrifices celebrated\r\non the plains of Bauce in the neighbourhood of Chartres, and find\r\npeople quietly erecting dolmens in the valley of the Dordogne.\r\n\r\nThe practices, however, of a Claudius or a Simon de Montfort\r\nare repugnant to the feelings of the Indians, and so long as no\r\npolitical issue is at stake, they rarely interfere with the religious\r\nproclivities of their neighbours.\r\n\r\nWhen from the hills inhabited by the Khonds we cross the delta of the\r\nGanges in a northerly direction, and come to the Khassia hills, we\r\nfind a very different state of things, but equally interesting as an\r\nillustration of our present studies. These hills are situated between\r\nthe valley of Assam and the plains of Sylhet, and, rising to a height\r\nof some 5000 to 6000 feet, catch the rains during the south-west\r\nmonsoon, and but for this would be one of the most delightful sanitaria\r\nof the Bengal province. A country, however, where 300 inches of rain\r\nfall in three months is, for at least a quarter of the year, an\r\nundesirable abode, and it is difficult also to keep any soil on the\r\nrocks. Throughout the whole of the western portion of the hilly region,\r\ninhabited by tribes bearing the generic name of Khassias, rude-stone\r\nmonuments exist in greater numbers than perhaps in any other portion\r\nof the globe of the same extent (woodcut No. 200). All travellers who\r\nhave visited the country have been struck with the fact and with the\r\ncurious similarity of their forms to those existing in Europe.[545]\r\nSo like, indeed, are they that it has long been the fashion to assume\r\ntheir identity, and it has consequently been often hoped that, if we\r\ncould only find out why the Indian examples were erected, we might\r\ndiscover the motive which guided those in Europe who constructed\r\nsimilar monuments, while at the same time there seemed every reason for\r\nbelieving that it would not be difficult to discover the motives which\r\nled to the erection of the Indian examples. The natives make no mystery\r\nabout them, and many were erected within the last few years, or are\r\nbeing erected now, and they are identical in form with those which are\r\ngrey with years, and must have been set up in the long forgotten past.\r\nHere, therefore, there seemed a chance of at last solving the mystery\r\nof the great stones. Greater familiarity with them has, however,\r\nrather tended to dispel these illusions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 200. View in Khassia Hills. By H. Walters.]\r\n\r\nThe Khassias burn their dead, which is a practice that hardly could\r\nhave had its origin in their present abodes, inasmuch as, during three\r\nmonths in the year, it is impossible, from the rain, to light a fire\r\nout of doors, and consequently, if any one dies during that period, the\r\nbody is placed in a coffin, formed from the hollowed trunk of a tree,\r\nand pickled in honey, till a fair day admits of his obsequies being\r\nproperly performed.[546] According to Mr. Walters, the urns containing\r\nthe ashes are placed in little circular cells, with flat tops like\r\nstools, which exist in the immediate proximity of all the villages, and\r\nare used as seats by the villagers on all state occasions of assembly;\r\nbut whether one stool is used for a whole family, or till it is filled\r\nwith urns, or whether a new stool is prepared when a great man dies,\r\nhas not yet been ascertained.[547]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 201. Khassia Funeral Seats. From Yule.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the menhirs is somewhat different. If any of the Khassia\r\ntribe falls ill or gets into difficulties, he prays to some one of\r\nhis deceased ancestors, whose spirit he fancies may be able and\r\nwilling to assist him. Father or mother, uncle or aunt, or some more\r\ndistant relative, may do equally well, and to enforce his prayer, he\r\nvows that, if it is granted, he will erect a stone in honour of the\r\ndeceased.[548] This he never fails to perform, and if the cure has been\r\nrapid, or the change in the luck so sudden as to be striking, others\r\naddress their prayers to the same person, and more stones are vowed.\r\nIt thus sometimes happens that a person, man or woman, who was by no\r\nmeans remarkable in life, may have five, or seven, or ten--two fives,\r\nfor the number must always be unequal--in their honour. The centre\r\nstone generally is crowned by a capital, or turban-like ornament, and\r\nsometimes two are joined together, forming a trilithon, but then they\r\napparently count as one. Major Austen mentions a set of five being\r\nerected in 1869 on the opposite side of the road to an original set of\r\nthe same number with which an old lady had previously been honoured, in\r\nconsequence of the services which after her death she had rendered to\r\nher tribe.[549]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 202. Menhirs and Tables. From Schlagintweit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 203. Turban Stone, with Stone Table.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 204. Trilithon.]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the stone tables or dolmens is not so clearly made out.\r\nLike the tomb stools, they frequently at least seem to be places of\r\nassembly. One, described by Major Austen, measured 30 feet 4 inches by\r\n10 feet in breadth, and had an average thickness of 1 foot; it had\r\nsteps to ascend to it; and certainly it looks like a place from which\r\nit would be convenient to address an audience. The great stone of this\r\nmonument weighed 23 tons 18 cwt., and another is described as measuring\r\n30 feet by 13 feet, and 1 foot 4 inches in thickness, and others seem\r\nnearly of the same dimensions; and they are frequently raised some\r\nheight from the ground, and supported on massive monoliths or pillars.\r\n\r\nWhile this is so, we need not wonder at the masses employed in the\r\nerection of Stonehenge or Avebury, or any of our European monuments.\r\nPhysically the Khassias are a very inferior race to what we can\r\nconceive our forefathers ever to have been. Their stage of civilization\r\nis barely removed from that of mere savages, and their knowledge of the\r\nmechanical arts is of the most primitive description. Add to all this\r\nthat their country is mountainous and rugged in the highest degree. Yet\r\nwith all these disadvantages they move these great stones and erect\r\nthem with perfect facility, while we are lost in wonder because our\r\nforefathers did something nearly equal to it some fourteen centuries\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThere are apparently no circles and no alignments on the hills, nor\r\nany of the forms which in the previous pages we have ascribed to\r\nbattle-fields, and no tumuli nor any of their derivatives, and no\r\nsculptured stones of any sort. The real likeness, therefore, between\r\nthe two forms of art is not so striking as it appears at first sight,\r\nbut still presents coincidences that it is impossible to overlook.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious points which an examination of these two Indian\r\ntribes brings to light with reference to the European congeners is that\r\nin Cuttack we have sacred groves, human sacrifices, an all-powerful\r\npriesthood indulging in divination, and various other peculiarities,\r\nall savouring of Druidism, but not one upright stone or stone monument\r\nof any sort. In the Khassia hills, on the other hand, we have dolmens,\r\nmenhirs, trilithons, and most of the forms of rude-stone architecture,\r\nbut no dominant priesthood, no human sacrifices, no groves, nor\r\nanything savouring of the Druidical religion.\r\n\r\nTo the European student the most interesting fact connected with the\r\nmonuments on the Khassia hills is probably their date. We do not know\r\nhow far back they extend, but we do know that many were erected within\r\nthe limits of the present century, and some within the last few years.\r\nYet this has taken place in presence of, and in immediate contact with,\r\ntwo far higher forms of civilization.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Khassia hills, to the north, lies the famous Hindu\r\nkingdom of Kamarupa. How far it extends back to, we do not know,\r\nbut its foundation was certainly anterior to the Christian era;\r\nand when Hiouen Thsang visited it in the beginning of the seventh\r\ncentury, he found it rich and prosperous, and containing \"temples by\r\nhundreds.\"[550] And now, in the jungles, ruins are continually being\r\ndiscovered of temples not so old perhaps as this date, but showing\r\ncontinued prosperity down to a far later period. All these temples are\r\nrichly and elaborately carved and ornamented with that exuberance of\r\ndetail characteristic of Hindu architecture.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the southern slope of the hills lies Sylhet. When it\r\nbecame great, we do not know, but it certainly was occupied by the\r\nMahommedans some centuries ago, and adorned with mosques and palaces\r\nand all that magnificence in which the Moslems indulged in the East.\r\nYet the Khassia looks down on these new forms of civilization unmoved.\r\nAs a servant or a trader he must have been for centuries familiar\r\nwith both: but he clings to his old faith, and erects his rude-stone\r\nmonuments, as his forefathers had done from time immemorial, and it is\r\ndoubtful whether either our soldiers or our missionaries will soon wean\r\nhim from this strange form of adoration.\r\n\r\nSurely all this is sufficient to make us pause before arguing from our\r\nown European experiences, or deciding questions when so few facts have\r\nhitherto been available on which to base any sound conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN INDIA.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of India there are some groups of rude-stone\r\nmonuments similar to those found in the Khassia hills, and apparently\r\nerected for similar purposes. They are, however, much less perfectly\r\nknown, and are described or at least drawn by only one traveller.[551]\r\nThe most conspicuous of these is one near Belgaum. It consists of\r\ntwo rows of thirteen stones each, and one in front of them of three\r\nstones--the numbers being always uneven, as in Bengal--and on the\r\nopposite side four of those small altars, or tables, which always\r\naccompany these groups of stones on the Khassia hills. These, however,\r\nare very much smaller, the central stone being only about 4 feet high,\r\nand falling off to about a foot in height at the end of each row.[552]\r\nWhether they were or were not dedicated to the same purpose, Colonel\r\nLeslie does not inform us; but their resemblance is so marked that\r\nthere seems very little doubt that they were dedicated or vowed to the\r\nspirits of deceased ancestors.\r\n\r\nAnother class of circular fanes looks at first sight more promising as\r\na means of comparison with ours. Generally they seem to consist of one\r\nor three stones, in front of which a circular space--in the largest\r\ninstance 40 feet in diameter, but more generally 20 to 30 feet only--is\r\nmarked out by a number of small stones, from 8 to 20 inches in height,\r\nwhile the great central stones are only 3 feet high. To compare these,\r\ntherefore, with our great megalithic monuments seems rather absurd.\r\nSo far as can be made out, the central stone seems to represent a\r\nlocal village deity, called Vetal or Betal, who, like Nadzu Pennu, the\r\nvillage god, one of the inferior deities of the Khonds, is familiarly\r\nrepresented merely by a rude-stone, placed under a tree.[553] In the\r\ninstance of Vetal, it seems when a sacrifice--generally of a cock--is\r\nto be made, all those who are interested bring their own stones, and\r\narrange them, in a circular fashion, round the place where the ceremony\r\nis to be performed; hence the superficial likeness. None, so far as is\r\nknown, are ancient, nor indeed has it at all been made out when and how\r\nthe worship of this deity arose. It is evidently a local superstition\r\nof some of the indigenous tribes, which latterly under our tolerant\r\nrule has become more prominent, for the sect is hated and despised by\r\nthe Brahmins; and so far as facts are concerned, it would be difficult\r\nto carry back the history of this form of architecture for a hundred\r\nyears from this time. It may be older, but there is nothing to show\r\nthat it is so.\r\n\r\nSo far as the monuments above mentioned are concerned, there seems\r\nnothing in them that affords a real analogy or establishes any direct\r\nconnexion between the European and Indian examples. The sacrifice of\r\na cock to Vetal, when in sickness, looks like a similar sacrifice to\r\nEsculapius, and the human sacrifices and sacred groves of the Khonds\r\nare very Druidical in appearance; but no one probably will be found to\r\ncontend that Vetal and Esculapius are the same god, or that the Khonds\r\nare Celts; and without this being established, the argument halts.\r\nThe case, however, seems different when we turn to the sepulchral\r\narrangements of the aboriginal tribes of India. Here the analogies are\r\nso striking that it is hard to believe that they are accidental, though\r\nequally hard to understand how and when the intercourse could have\r\ntaken place which led to their similarity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 205. Dolmen at Rajunkoloor. From a drawing by Colonel\r\nMeadows Taylor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 206. Plan of Open Dolmen at Rajunkoloor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 207. Closed Dolmen at Rajunkoloor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 208. View of Closed Dolmen at Rajunkoloor.]\r\n\r\nAs in Europe, the sepulchral monuments of India may be divided into\r\ntwo great classes--the dolmens and the tumuli. In the present state\r\nof our knowledge it is difficult to say which are the more numerous.\r\nAccording to Colonel Meadows Taylor,[554] who is our best authority\r\non the subject, the dolmens are of two kinds--those consisting of four\r\nstones, that is to say, three supporting stones and one cap-stone--thus\r\nleaving one side open--and those in which the chamber is closed by a\r\nfourth stone; in the latter case this fourth stone has invariably a\r\ncircular opening in it, like the Circassian examples (woodcuts Nos.\r\n192, 193), and the dolmen at Trie (No. 127). These forms are both shown\r\nin woodcut No. 205, representing two at Rajunkoloor, in the province\r\nof Sholapore, between the Bheema and Kistnah, near their junction. The\r\nside-stones of the larger monument measure 15 feet 3 inches by 9 feet\r\nin height, and more than 1 foot in thickness. The cap-stone is 15 feet\r\n9 inches by 10 feet 9 inches, and the internal space 8 feet by 6 feet,\r\nthe third slab being placed at some distance from the rear, and between\r\nthe two side-stones. The same arrangement is followed in the closed\r\ndolmen, the cross slabs being inside, as shown in the view (woodcut No.\r\n208), and plan (woodcut No. 207). The interior of the closed dolmen\r\ncontained a little black mould on the surface. Below this a greyish\r\nwhite earth, brought from a distance, with which were found human ashes\r\nand portions of bones and charcoal mixed, and pieces of broken pottery,\r\nred and black. These rested on the solid rock on which the dolmen was\r\nerected. Nothing whatever was found in any of the open dolmens; but\r\nwhether this arose from their being plundered, or from being exposed,\r\nis not clear. It could hardly have been that they were not sepulchral.\r\nThey seem at least to be mixed up indiscriminately with the others,\r\nand except their being open, there is nothing to distinguish them. The\r\narrangement of these dolmens in plan is peculiar. As will be seen from\r\nthe next woodcut (No. 209), they are as regular as in our cemeteries,\r\nand apparently in certain directions would have gone on extending _ad\r\ninfinitum_; but in another direction are cairns irregularly spaced, and\r\nshowing a distinction in the mode of burying which at present it is\r\ndifficult to account for.\r\n\r\nAt a place in the Raichore Doab, called Yemmee Gooda, four of the\r\ndolmens of the first class were surrounded by double circles of stones;\r\nbut this does not seem to be a usual arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 209. Arrangement of Dolmens at Rajunkoloor. By Colonel\r\nMeadows Taylor.]\r\n\r\nAlmost more interesting than the dolmens are the cairns. The following\r\nplan of the group at Jewurgi, a place fifty miles, as the crow flies,\r\nnorth-east from Rajunkoloor, will explain their arrangement and\r\njuxtaposition. They, too, seem to divide themselves into two classes,\r\nas shown in the two sections--those with a summit-cist, like those in\r\nAuvergne, and those without; all, however, apparently have single and\r\ndouble circles of stones surrounding them. Two stones are generally\r\nfound protruding slightly through the surface of the tumulus, and when\r\nan excavation is made between them, the cist is found laid in their\r\ndirection at a depth of 9 to 10 feet below the surface. This seems to\r\nbe generally double, and contains skeletons laid on their faces. At\r\none end, but outside the cist, are quantities of pottery, and above\r\nthe cist a number of skeletons, thrown in pellmell, and over these a\r\nthick layer of earth and gravel. Detached heads are found sometimes\r\nin the cists, sometimes outside among the pottery, which led Colonel\r\nTaylor to the conclusion that human sacrifices had been practised at\r\nthe time these cairns were raised, and that these are the remains of\r\nthe wives or slaves of the defunct. It may be so, but it may also be\r\nthat, as in Europe, we must make a distinction between battle-fields\r\nand cemeteries; and I confess the idea that the cairns at Jewurgi mark\r\na battle-field, and the dolmens at Rajunkoloor a cemetery, appears to\r\naccount for the phenomena better than the other hypothesis. If this is\r\nnot so, as the distance between Rajunkoloor and Jewurgi is only fifty\r\nmiles, we must assume either that the district was inhabited by two\r\ndifferent races of men at the same time, practising different modes of\r\nsepulture, or we must concede that the one is older than the other, and\r\nthat the one race had been dispossessed and was succeeded by the other.\r\nThe difficulties attending either of these suppositions appear to me\r\ninfinitely greater than those involved in assuming that the one is a\r\nbattle-field, the other a cemetery. The only thing that would make me\r\nhesitate about this is the presence of several cairns at Rajunkoloor.\r\nThese, however, do not appear to have been opened, and we do not\r\nconsequently know whether the same instances of decapitation were to\r\nbe found, or whether the bodies were arranged in the same manner as at\r\nJewurgi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 210. Cairns at Jewurgi. By Colonel Meadows Taylor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 211. Section of Cairn at Jewurgi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 212. Section of Cairn at Jewurgi.]\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, if these sections are to be depended on, it appears\r\nto be tolerably certain that these tombs cannot be old. It seems\r\nimpossible that human bones could remain so entire and perfect as these\r\nare represented to be, so near the surface and in a recently disturbed\r\nsoil, where rain and moisture must easily have penetrated at all times.\r\nA medical man on the spot might determine whether two or three or five\r\ncenturies have elapsed since these bodies were laid where they are\r\nfound; but I should be very much surprised if he raised their date\r\nbeyond the last named figure. It is hazardous, however, to pronounce on\r\nsuch questions from the scanty data we have before us.\r\n\r\nThere is still another class of dolmens, or rather kistvaens, common\r\non the Nilgiri hills and throughout the hill region of Malabar. In it\r\nthe chamber is formed like those described above, but always buried\r\nin the earth, only showing the cap-stone flush with the surface of\r\nthe soil. One of these, in the Coorg country, is worth quoting, from\r\nits possessing two circular apertures, like those of the Plas Newydd\r\ntumulus (woodcut No. 48). This one, however, has a diaphragm dividing\r\nit into two chambers. If the Welsh one was so partitioned, the wall has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 213. Double Dolmen, Coorg.[555]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 214. Tomb, Nilgiri Hills. From a drawing by Sir Walter\r\nElliot.]\r\n\r\nOne other class of monument must be quoted, not as illustrating any\r\nof our examples, but because it is so nearly identical with the\r\nchouchas[556] of Northern Africa (woodcut No. 165), and when we try to\r\nfind out whether there was any real connexion between the East and the\r\nWest, such examples may afford valuable flints. According to Sir Walter\r\nElliot,[557] they are the commonest, or rather, perhaps, the most\r\nconspicuous, being perched on the tops of hills or ridges. Their form\r\nis a circular wall of uncemented rough stones, 4 to 5 feet high, 3 feet\r\nthick, and 6 to 8 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 215. Sepulchral Circles at Amravati.]\r\n\r\nOne other variety is interesting, not only from its similarity to\r\nthose in Europe, especially in Scandinavia, but also from its bearing\r\non the question of the age of those in India. The sepulchres of this\r\nclass are all very like one another, and consist of small circles\r\nof rude stones, generally of two dimensions only, 24 and 32 feet in\r\ndiameter, and have something like an opening on one side, and opposite\r\nthis two or three stones within the circle, apparently marking the\r\nposition of the sepulchral deposit.[558] Monuments very similar to\r\nthese exist in the Nilgiri hills, and elsewhere in India,[559] but\r\nthey are principally found at the roots of the hills round Amravati,\r\nwhere they exist literally in hundreds. No one, probably, who studies\r\nColonel Mackenzie's map of that district[560] will doubt that they form\r\nthe cemetery of the city of Dharani Kotta, to which the Amravati Tope\r\nis attached. As in China, burying in the fertile land was not allowed,\r\nand consequently the place selected for the graves of the inhabitants\r\nwas the nearest uncultivated spot, which was the foot of the hills.\r\nSo far as is at present known, these circular graves exist nowhere in\r\nsuch numbers as here, and it can hardly be doubted but that they have\r\nsome connexion with the great circular rail of the Amravati Tope. That\r\nrail is unique in India, whether we consider its extent, the beauty of\r\nits sculptures, or the elaborateness of its finish. Other rails exist\r\nelsewhere surrounding dagobas or sacred spots, but none where the\r\ncircle itself is relatively so much greater and more magnificent than\r\nthe surrounding objects. The question thus arises, did the Amravati\r\ncircle grow out of the rude-stone graves that cluster round the hills\r\nin its neighbourhood, or are the rude circles humble copies of that\r\npride of the city? I have myself no doubt that the latter is the true\r\nexplanation of the phenomena; but the grounds for this conclusion\r\nwill be clearer as we proceed. Meanwhile it is hardly worth while\r\nenumerating all the smaller varieties of form which the rude-stone\r\nsepulchres of the Indians took in former days. Their numbers in many\r\nclasses are few, and have no direct bearing on the subject of our\r\nenquiries.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\nNothing would tend more to convey clear ideas on the subject of\r\nIndian dolmens than a map of their distribution, were it possible to\r\nconstruct one. As, however, no nation even in Europe, except France,\r\nis in a position to attempt such a thing, it is in vain to expect\r\nthat sufficient information for the purpose should exist in India,\r\nwhere the subject has been taken up only so recently in so sporadic\r\na manner.[561] The following sketch, however, is perhaps not very\r\nfar from the truth regarding them. They do not exist in the valley\r\nof the Ganges, or of any of its tributaries, nor in the valleys of\r\nthe Nerbudda or Taptee; not, in fact, in that part of India which is\r\ngenerally described as north of the Vindhya range of hills. They exist,\r\nthough somewhat sparsely, over the whole of the country drained by\r\nthe Godavery and its affluents. They are very common, perhaps more\r\nfrequent than in any other part of India, in the valleys of the Kistnah\r\nand its tributaries. They are also found on both sides of the Ghâts,\r\nthrough Coimbatore, all the way down to Cape Comorin; and they are also\r\nfound in groups all over the Madras presidency, but especially in the\r\nneighbourhood of Conjeveran.\r\n\r\nThe first inference one is inclined to draw from this is that they must\r\nbe Dravidian, as contradistinguished from Aryan; and it may be so.\r\nBut against this view we have the fact that all the races at present\r\ndominant in the south repudiate them: none use similar modes of burial\r\nnow, nor do any object to our digging them up and destroying them.\r\n\r\nIf we look a little deeper, we come to a race of Karumbers, to whom\r\nSir Walter Elliot is inclined to ascribe the bulk of the rude-stone\r\nmonuments.[562] From his own researches, and the various documents\r\ncontained in the Mackenzie MSS.,[563] they seem to have been a powerful\r\nrace in the south of India, from the earliest times to which our\r\nknowledge extends, and to have continued powerful about Conjeveran\r\nand Madras till say the tenth or eleventh centuries, when they were\r\noverpowered by the Cholas, and finally disappear from the political\r\nhorizon before the rising supremacy of that triumvirate of powers, the\r\nChola, Chera, Pandya, who governed the south till the balance of power\r\nwas disturbed by the Mahommedan and Maharatta invasions.\r\n\r\nA wretched remnant of these Karumbers still exists on the Nilgiri\r\nhills, and about the roots of the western Ghâts, but without a\r\nliterature or a history, or even traditions that would enable us to\r\nidentify or distinguish them from any of the other races of the south.\r\nThe only test that seems capable of application is that of language,\r\nand this philologers have determined to be a dialect of the Dravidian\r\ntongues.[564] But, in such a case as this, language is a most unsafe\r\nguide. Within recent times the Cornish have changed their language\r\nwithout any alteration of race, and if intercommunication goes on\r\nat its present rate, English, in a century or two, may be the only\r\nlanguage spoken in these islands. From the names of places we would\r\nknow that Celtic races had inhabited many localities, but from the\r\ntongue of the people we should not know now that the Cornish, or then\r\nthat the Welsh, were more Celtic than the inhabitants of Yorkshire or\r\nthe Lothians. So in India nothing seems more likely than that, during\r\nthe last eight or ten centuries, the Tamulian or Dravidian influence\r\nshould have spread northward to the Vindhya, and that the Gonds, the\r\nKarumbers, and other subject half-civilized races, should have adopted\r\nthe language of their conquerors and masters. It may be otherwise, but\r\nwe know certainly that the southern Dravidians brought their style of\r\narchitecture--as difficult a thing to change almost as language--as far\r\nnorth as Ellora, and carved the imperishable rocks there, in the eighth\r\nor ninth century, in the style that was indigenous at Tanjore;[565] and\r\nthis, too, for the purpose of marking their triumph over the religion\r\nof Buddha, which they had just succeeded in abolishing in the south.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, there are still two distinguishing features which may\r\nhelp us to discriminate between the candidates for the rude-stone\r\nmonuments. The true Dravidians--the Chola, Chera, Pandya--never were\r\nBuddhists, and never put forward a claim to have erected any monuments\r\nof this class. The Karumbers were Buddhists, and claim these monuments;\r\nand Buddhism and such structures must, I fancy, for reasons to be given\r\nhereafter, always have gone together.\r\n\r\nFurther researches may enable us to speak with precision on the\r\nsubject, but all we can at present do is to except, first, the Aryans\r\nof the north, and all the people incorporated with them, from the\r\ncharge of being builders of rude-stone monuments. We must also except\r\nthe Tamulians or pure Dravidians of the south. But between these two\r\nthere must have been some race, whom, for the present at least, we may\r\ncall Karumbers. One of their centres of power was Conjeveran, but from\r\nthat they were driven, as far as I can make out, about the year 750.\r\nBut it does not appear that they might not have existed as a power on\r\nthe banks of the Upper Kistnah and Tongabudra to a much later period.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the Chalukya kingdom, which arose at Kalyan early in the\r\nseventh century,[566] and of that of Vijianagara, which was established\r\nin the Tongabudra in the fourteenth, are so nearly coincident with the\r\nlimits of the dolmen region--except where the latter was compressed on\r\nthe north by the Mahommedan kingdom of Beejapore--that it seems most\r\nprobable that there must have been a homogeneity among the people of\r\nthat central province of which we have now lost the trace.\r\n\r\nThis, however, like many other questions of the sort, must be postponed\r\ntill we know something of the Nizam's country. In so far as the history\r\nor ethnography of the central plateau of India is concerned, or its\r\narts or architecture, the Nizam's dominions are absolutely a _terra\r\nincognita_. No one has visited the country who had any knowledge of\r\nthese subjects, and the Indian Government has done nothing to enquire,\r\nor to stimulate enquiry, into these questions in that country. Yet, if\r\nI am not very much mistaken, the solution of half the difficulties,\r\nethnological or archæological, that are now perplexing us lies on the\r\nsurface of that region, for anyone who will take the trouble to read\r\nthem. Till this is done, we must, it is feared, be content with the\r\nvaguest generalities; but even now I fancy we are approaching a better\r\nstate of knowledge in these matters, and I almost believe I can trace\r\na connexion between our so-called Karumbers and the Singalese, which,\r\nif it can be sustained, will throw a flood of light on some of the most\r\npuzzling questions of Indian ethnography.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGE OF THE STONE MONUMENTS.\r\n\r\nA glimmering of light seemed to be thrown on this subject by a passage\r\nquoted by Sir Walter Elliot from a missionary report from Travancore,\r\nin which it was stated that an Indian tribe still continued to bury\r\nin \"cromlechs,\" like those of Coimbatore, \"constructed with four\r\nstones and a covering one.\"[567] If this were so, we might have got\r\nhold of one end of a thread which would lead us backwards through the\r\nlabyrinth. It looked so like a crucial instance that Mr. Walhouse\r\nkindly wrote to Mr. Baker, the author of the report in question, and\r\nsent me an extract from his reply, which is curious. \"The M[a]la\r\nArryians are a race of men dwelling in dense jungles and hills.\r\nCromlechs are common among them, and they worship the spirits of their\r\nancestors, to whom they make annual offerings. At the present day they\r\nare accustomed to take corpses into the sacred groves, and place small\r\nslabs of stones, in the form of a box, and, after making offerings\r\nof arrack, sweetmeats, &c., to the departed spirit, supposed to be\r\nhovering near, a small stone is placed in the model box or vault, and\r\nit is covered over with great ceremony. The spirit is supposed to dwell\r\nin the stone, which in many cases is changed at the annual feast into\r\na rough silver or brass figure.\" As Mr. Walhouse remarks, this looks\r\nlike an echo from megalithic times. The people, having lost the power\r\nof erecting such huge structures as abound in their hills and on the\r\nplains around, from which they may have been driven at some early\r\nperiod, are content still to keep up the traditions of a primæval usage\r\nby these miniature shams. There seems little doubt that this is the\r\ncase, and it is especially interesting to have observed it here, as it\r\naccounts for what has often puzzled Indian antiquaries. In Coorg and\r\nelsewhere, miniature urns and miniature utensils, such as one sees used\r\nas toys in European nurseries, are often found in these tombs, and have\r\ngiven rise to a tradition among the natives that they belong to a race\r\nof pigmies: whereas it is evident that it is only a dying out of an\r\nancient faith, when, as is so generally the case, the symbol supersedes\r\nthe reality.\r\n\r\nThe articles found in the cairns and dolmens in India unfortunately\r\nafford us very little assistance in determining their age. The pottery\r\nthat is found in quantities in them everywhere, is to all appearances,\r\nidentical in form, in texture, and in glaze with the pottery of the\r\npresent day. No archaic forms have, so far as I know, been found\r\nanywhere, nor anything that would indicate a progression. This might be\r\nused as an argument to prove how modern they were. In India, however,\r\nit would be most unsafe to do so. We have no knowledge as to how long\r\nago these forms were introduced into or invented in that country, and\r\nno reason to suppose that they would change and progress as ours do. So\r\nfar as our present knowledge extends, the pottery found in these tombs\r\nmay have been made within the last few centuries, but it may also be a\r\nthousand or two thousand years old for anything we know to the contrary.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks apply to the gold and silver ornaments and generally\r\nto the trinkets found in the tombs. Similar objects may be picked up in\r\nthe bazaars in remote districts at the present day, but they may also\r\nhave been in use in the time of Alexander the Great. Iron spear-heads\r\nand iron utensils of the most modern shape and pattern are among the\r\ncommonest objects found in these tombs; and if anyone were arguing for\r\nvictory, and not for the truth, these might be adduced to prove that\r\nthe tombs belonged to what the Germans call \"the youngest Iron age.\"\r\nThis reasoning has no application whatever to India. Flint implements\r\nare found there, and very similar to those of Europe, but never in the\r\ntombs. Bronze was probably known to the Indians at a remote age, but\r\nno bronze implements have been buried with the dead so far as we yet\r\nknow, though iron has been, and that frequently; but its presence tells\r\nus nothing as to age. So far we know, the Indians were as familiar\r\nwith the use of iron in the fourth century B.C. as the Greeks\r\nthemselves were, and, for anything we know to the contrary, may have\r\nunderstood the art of extracting it from the ore and using it for arms\r\nand cutting-tools before these arts were practised in Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 216. Iron Pillar at the Kutub, Delhi. From a\r\nphotograph.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious and interesting illustrations of this is\r\nfound in the existence of the celebrated iron pillar of Dhava, in the\r\ncourtyard of the mosque at the Kutub, near Delhi. This consists of\r\na solid shaft of wrought iron, standing 22 feet 6 inches out of the\r\nground and is 5 feet 6 inches in circumference at about 5 feet from\r\nits base. When I visited it, the report was that Colonel Baird Smith\r\nhad dug down and found its base 16 feet below the surface. Lieutenant\r\nCole[568] now brings home a report that it is 26 feet deep in the\r\nground. Taking, however, the more moderate dimension, a single forging\r\nnearly 40 feet long and 5 feet circumference was not made, and could\r\nnot have been made, in any country of Europe before the introduction\r\nof steam-machinery, nor, indeed, before the invention of the Nasmyth\r\nhammer.\r\n\r\nThere is an inscription on the pillar which, unfortunately, bears no\r\ndate; but from the form of the characters, the nature of the event it\r\ndescribes,[569] coupled with the architecture of the capital of the\r\npillar, it leaves no doubt that it was erected in the third or fourth\r\ncentury of our era.\r\n\r\nIt must be left to those practically skilled in the working of metals\r\nto explain how any human being could work in close proximity to such\r\na mass heated to a welding heat, or how it was possible without\r\nsteam-machinery to manipulate so enormous a bar of iron. The question\r\nthat interests us here is, how long must the Hindus have been familiar\r\nwith the use of iron and the mode of working it before they could\r\nconceive the idea of such a monument and carry it into execution? It\r\ncould hardly have been centuries, it must have been nearer thousands of\r\nyears, and yet they erect rude-stone monuments in India at the present\r\nday![570]\r\n\r\nOne other instance, at the lower end of the scale, may be quoted as\r\nalso bearing directly on this subject. Of all the people of India the\r\nKhassias are probably the most expert in extracting iron from its ores\r\nand manufacturing it when made; and their mode of doing this is so\r\noriginal, and, though rude, so effective, that there can be no doubt\r\nthat it is the result of long experience among themselves.[571] They\r\nhave, in fact, practised the art from time immemorial; yet though\r\npossessing iron tools for, it may be, thousands of years, they at\r\nthe present day adhere to the practice of using rude unhewn-stone\r\nmonuments, like the Jews, in preference to those \"which any iron tool\r\nhad touched at any time.\"[572] Nor can it be argued that they do\r\nthis because they do not know better. As just mentioned, at any time,\r\ncertainly within the last thousand years, they might have seen the\r\nBuddhist or Hindu stonemasons of Kamarupa erecting the most elaborately\r\ncarved stone temples, and can now see the domes of the mosques which\r\nthe Mahommedans erected in the cities of Sylhet three or four centuries\r\nago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 217. Sculpture on under side of Cap-stone of a Nilgiri\r\nDolmen.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it thus happens that all these _à priori_ reasonings and\r\nmistaken analogies, drawn from our own progressive state, which are so\r\nfamiliar to European antiquaries, break down at once when applied to\r\nIndia, still there are a few indications from which approximate dates\r\nmay be obtained, and many more could, no doubt, be found if looked\r\nfor. One of these is, that the greater number of the dolmens of the\r\nNilgiri hills are sculptured; but only one of the drawings on them, so\r\nfar as I know, has been published,[573] and though it is ungracious to\r\nsay so, I fear that it is not a very faithful representation. It is,\r\nhowever, sufficiently so to enable us to recognise at once a similarity\r\nto a class of monuments very common in the plains. These are called\r\nViracull, if destined to commemorate men or heroes, and Masteecull if\r\nerected in honour of women who sacrifice themselves on their husband's\r\nfunereal pile. Colonel Mackenzie collected drawings of more than one\r\nhundred of these, which are now in the India Office, and photographs of\r\nmany others have been made but not published.\r\n\r\nThe similarity in the costume and style of art displayed in the\r\npreceding woodcut with that of the memorial stones leaves little or\r\nno doubt of their being approximately of the same age. As most of the\r\nmemorial stones are inscribed and their dates at least approximately\r\nknown, if the identity can be established the date of the dolmens can\r\nalso be determined. Till, however, some one will take the trouble of\r\nphotographing the cairns, so as to enable us to compare them with the\r\nstanding stones, no certainty can be obtained; but as none of the\r\nsculptured stones go back a thousand years, and those most like the\r\nwoodcut cannot claim five centuries of antiquity, these sculptured\r\ncairns in the Nilgiris cannot be so very old as is sometimes assumed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 218. Dolmen at Iwullee. From a photograph.]\r\n\r\nThe second instance is curious and instructive. In the centre of the\r\ncourtyard of a now ruined Sivite temple at Iwullee, in Dharwar, in the\r\nvery centre of the dolmen country, now stands a regular tripod dolmen\r\nof the usual shape (woodcut No. 218). The question is, how got it\r\nthere? No one who knows anything of India will, I presume, argue that\r\nthe Brahminical followers of Siva would erect the sanctuary of their\r\ngod in front of the tomb of one of the despised aboriginal tribes,\r\nif still reverenced by them, or would have neglected to utilize\r\nit if neglected. One of two things therefore only seems possible.\r\nEither a Korumber, or native chief of some denomination, stipulated\r\nthat on his conversion to the faith of the Brahmins, if he erected a\r\ntemple in honour of his newly-adopted god, he should be allowed to be\r\nburied, \"more majorum,\" in the courtyard. This is possible, but hardly\r\nprobable. It seems more likely that, after the temple was desecrated\r\nand neglected, some native thought the spot fit and appropriate for\r\nhis last resting-place, and was buried there accordingly. From its\r\narchitecture, there is no doubt that the age of the temple may be\r\ncarried back as far as the thirteenth century, but it more probably\r\nbelongs to the fourteenth. According to the first hypothesis, the age\r\nof the dolmen would be that of the temple; according to the second,\r\none, two, or three centuries more modern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 219. Stone Monuments at Shahpoor.]\r\n\r\nA third indirect piece of evidence is derived from Colonel Meadows\r\nTaylor's paper in the 'Irish Transactions.' He represents a tolerably\r\nextensive group of these monuments as placed immediately outside the\r\ncity gate at Shahpoor, and from what he says of them they are evidently\r\nof the same age as the other examples he quotes. From their position\r\nand arrangement, it does not seem doubtful that they are the usual\r\nextramural cemetery so generally attached to Indian cities, and they\r\nare, in fact, subsequent in date to the erection of the gate in front\r\nof which they are placed. The gateway, I learn from a letter from\r\nColonel Meadows Taylor, undoubtedly belongs to the Mahommedan period.\r\nIt is a regular arch, of the usual pointed form, and consequently\r\nsubsequent to 1347 A.D., when the Bahmany dynasty first\r\nestablished themselves in this quarter. This being so, the masons who\r\nbuilt the gate would certainly have utilized the tombs of the pagans\r\nhad they existed previously. They must, therefore, be subsequent to\r\nthe gate; and as it cannot be five centuries old, we have a limit to\r\ntheir age beyond which we cannot go.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 220. Cross at Katapur. From a photograph.]\r\n\r\nOur next example is still more curious and interesting. In the cold\r\nweather of 1867-8, Mr. Mulheran, when attached to the Trigonometrical\r\nSurvey of India, came accidentally across a great group of \"cromlechs,\"\r\nsituated on the banks of the Godavery, near Nirmul, about halfway\r\nbetween Hyderabad and Nagpore, in Central India. Some of these he\r\nphotographed, and sent an account of them to the Asiatic Society of\r\nBengal,[574] from which the following particulars are gleaned. \"The\r\nmajority of the cromlechs consist of a number of upright stones,\r\nsunk in the ground in the form of a square, and covered with one\r\nor two large slabs of sandstone. In some two bodies appear to have\r\nbeen interred, and in others only one. The crosses are found in the\r\nneighbourhood of Malúr and Katapur, two villages on the Nizam's side\r\nof the river. The crosses at Katapur (woodcut No. 220) are, with one\r\nexception, uninjured. All are situated to the right of the cromlechs\r\nnear which they have been erected. Judging from the one lying exposed\r\nat Malúr, they are all above 10 feet in length, although only 6 to\r\n7 feet appear above ground. They all consist of one stone, and are\r\nall of the latest form. No information of any kind could be obtained\r\nregarding the people by whom the crosses or cromlechs were erected.\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that the crosses are memorials of the\r\nfaith of Christians buried in their vicinity.\" Close by is a cave,\r\nbefore which a cross was erected, which Mr. Mulheran assumes was thrown\r\ndown by the Brahmins when they took possession of it; and he adds, \"I\r\nenclose a note from Captain Glasfurd, who sent a packet of implements,\r\nrings, and utensils, found in two of the cromlechs he opened, to the\r\nAsiatic Society.\" No such packet, however, ever arrived, and we are,\r\ntherefore, left to his photographs and descriptions from which to draw\r\nour conclusions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 221. Dolmen at Katapur. From a photograph.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 222. Dolmen with Cross in Nirmul Jungle.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I think it can hardly be doubted that the crosses\r\nare Christian emblems; and secondly, that the cromlechs and crosses\r\nare of the same date. Their juxtaposition and whole appearance render\r\nescape from this conclusion apparently inevitable. The question,\r\ntherefore, is, when could any community of native Christians have\r\nexisted in India who would bury in dolmens and use the cross as their\r\nemblems? Their distance from the coast and the form of the cross seem\r\nat once to cut them off from all connexion with St. Thomas's mission\r\nor that of the early apostles, even assuming that the records of\r\nthese are authentic. My impression is that this form of cross was not\r\nintroduced as an out-of-doors self-standing sign till, say, the sixth\r\nor seventh century.[575] On the other hand, it is extremely improbable\r\nthat any such community could have existed after the Mahommedan\r\ninvasion at the end of the thirteenth century. Between these limits\r\nwe know that the Nestorians had establishments as far east as China,\r\nand extending in a continuous chain westward as far at least as the\r\nCaspian;[576] and there seems to be no difficulty in assuming that,\r\nbetween the seventh and the thirteenth centuries a form of Taiping\r\nChristianity may have been introduced from the north and established\r\nitself extensively in the western and central parts of India, but,\r\nowing allegiance only to the potentate we know of as Prester John,\r\nmay have entirely escaped the knowledge of the Western world. Besides\r\nhelping to fix the date of the dolmens in India, this discovery opens\r\nout a wide field for those who would investigate the early history of\r\nthe Christian Church in India. There can be little doubt that this\r\ngroup is not solitary. Many more will be found, when people open their\r\neyes and look for them. Meanwhile it is a curious illustration of the\r\npolicy of Pope Gregory in his advice to Abbot Mellitus, alluded to\r\nin the Introduction (page 21). It is the same thing as the dolmen at\r\nKerland (woodcut No. 131), and that at Arrichinaga (woodcut No. 161),\r\nrepeated in the centre of India, though probably at a somewhat later\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is still another point of view from which these Indian monuments\r\nmay be regarded, so as to throw considerable light on the history\r\nof their analogues in Europe, and perhaps to modify to some extent\r\nour preconceived views regarding their history. In Ceylon there is a\r\nclass of dagoba, which, in some respects, is peculiar to the island.\r\nTwo of these will suffice for our present purposes, both in the city\r\nof Anuradhapura, which was the capital of the country from about\r\nB.C. 400 till the eleventh century. The first of these,\r\nthe Thupa Ramayana, was erected B.C. 161; the second, the\r\nLanka Ramayana, A.D. 231.[577] For the sake of the argument\r\nit would be best to select the first for illustration; but it was,\r\nunfortunately, so completely restored about forty years ago that, as\r\nin the case of our unfortunate cathedrals, it requires considerable\r\nknowledge of the style to discriminate between what is old and what\r\nnew. Notwithstanding the four centuries that elapsed between their\r\ndates, however, they are so like one another in all essentials that it\r\nis of little consequence which we select. Neither is large, and both\r\nconsist of nearly hemispherical domes, surmounted by a square box-like\r\nappendage called a Tee, and both are surrounded by three rows of tall\r\nstone pillars, as shown in the accompanying woodcut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 223. Lanka Ramayana Dagoba, A.D. 231. From a\r\nphotograph.]\r\n\r\nThat the domical part of the dagoba is the lineal and direct descendant\r\nof the sepulchral tumuli or cairns, which are found everywhere in\r\nNorthern Asia and probably existed in India in primæval times, is\r\nhardly open to doubt. This the Buddhists early refined into a relic\r\nshrine, probably immediately after the death of the founder of the\r\nreligion, B.C. 543; and we know from numerous excavations[578]\r\nthat the relic was placed in a cist in the centre of the mound, nearly\r\non the level of the soil, exactly where, and in the same manner as,\r\nthe body-containing kistvaens of our sepulchral tumuli. To this,\r\nhowever, the Buddhists added a square box on the top, which either\r\nwas invented by them or copied from some earlier form; but no dagoba\r\nwas complete without it, and all the rock-cut examples and sculptured\r\nrepresentations of topes, with many structural ones, still possess\r\nit. That it represented a wooden relic-casket may be assumed as\r\ncertain, but whether it was ever used as such is not quite clear. The\r\nrelics were sometimes accessible, and shown to the public on festal\r\noccasions,[579] and unless they were contained in some external case\r\nlike this it is not easy to see how they could be got at. A third\r\nindispensable part of a perfect dagoba was an enclosing rail. All the\r\nearly dagobas and all the sculptured representations possess this\r\nadjunct. In the rock-cut examples and in the later structural ones the\r\nrail becomes attached to the building as a mere ornament, but is never\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 224. Dolmen at Pullicondah.]\r\n\r\nIf we compare such a sepulchral mound as this at Pullicondah, near\r\nMadras,[580] or that represented in section, woodcut No. 211, with\r\nthe Lanka or Thupa Ramayana dagobas, we cannot fail to be struck with\r\ntheir similarity. Both possess the mound, the rail, and the tee; and in\r\nthis last instance it is a simulated tomb, such as many in Europe are\r\nsuspected of having been. That a people might both bury in barrows and\r\nerect domical cairns to contain relics would not necessarily involve a\r\nproof of the one form being copied from the other; but that both should\r\nbe surmounted by a simulated sarcophagus or shrine, and both surrounded\r\nby one, two, or three rows of useless stones, points to a direct\r\nimitation of the one from the other which can hardly be accidental.\r\n\r\nAssuming for the nonce that the one is copied from the other, the\r\nordinary mode of reasoning with which we are familiar in Europe would\r\nbe then something like this. If the Thupa Ramayana were erected\r\nB.C. 161, this cairn at Pullicondah must probably be as old as\r\nB.C. 1000, for it would take many centuries before so rude a\r\nstyle of architecture could be reformed into so polished an example as\r\nthe Thupa Ramayana, which, as before stated, we may assume as identical\r\nwith the Lanka Ramayana (woodcut No. 223).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 225. Rail at Sanchi, near Bhilsa.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusions I have arrived at are diametrically opposed to this\r\nview. As stated at the beginning of this chapter, the architectural\r\nmaterial of India was wood, down to B.C. 250 or 300. It then\r\nbecame timidly lithic, but retained all its wooden forms and simulated\r\ncarpentry fastenings down, at all events, to the Christian era. The\r\nrail at Sanchi, which was erected in the course of the two centuries\r\npreceding our era, is still essentially wooden in all its parts, so\r\nmuch so that it is difficult to see how it could be constructed in\r\nstone,[581] and these pillars round the Ceylonese dagobas are copies of\r\nwooden posts, and not such forms as in any number of centuries would\r\nhave grown out of rude-stone forms. Had they been derived from the\r\nlatter original they would have been thick, strong and massive, and\r\nnever have assumed forms so curiously attenuated as we find here. It\r\nis difficult to see what these stone pillars or posts were originally\r\nintended for. It may have been either that garlands might be hung upon\r\nthem on festal occasions, as we see represented in the sculptures, or\r\nthat pictures might be suspended from them, as Fa Hian, who visited\r\nthis place in the year 400, tells us was done all the way from\r\nAnuradhapura to Mehentele on the occasion of a great procession in\r\nhonour of the Tooth relic which was there exposed to public view.[582]\r\n\r\nBe all this as it may, the question which this comparison raises is\r\nsimply this: If we admit the similarity between the Pullicondah cairn\r\nand the Lanka Ramayana Tope, and that the one grew out of the other,\r\nit seems to me perfectly evident that the adjunct of the Tope grew out\r\nof a wooden and not out of a rude-stone original. If this is so, and\r\nif the Tope did not grow out of the cairn, the conclusion seems to me\r\ninevitable that the cairn is only a rude copy of a polished original.\r\n\r\nThe same conclusion hinted at above was forced on me by the examination\r\nof the rude-stone circles which crowd round the elaborate tope at\r\nAmravati. Generally, I know of no hypothesis by which the phenomenon\r\nof polished-stone buildings, with known dates, existing in India for\r\nthe last 2000 years side by side with rude-stone monuments which are\r\nbeing erected at this day, can be accounted for, unless we give up our\r\nfavourite system of sequence and are content to take facts as we find\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt is quite certain there were no hewn-stone buildings in India before\r\nthe year 250 B.C., and my impression is that none of the\r\nrude-stone monuments now existing there were erected till five, it may\r\nbe ten centuries from that time, and when they once began that there is\r\nno break in the sequence to the present day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI know nothing that can be fairly urged against this reasoning, except\r\nour own ignorance, and that of the natives themselves, with regard\r\nto the origin and date of these monuments. Neither is much to be\r\nwondered at, as it is only so lately that Europeans have turned their\r\nattention to the subject, and the natives know so little about their\r\nown monuments that it would be strange indeed if they knew anything\r\nat all about those of the hated and despised Dasyus. Any one who has\r\ntravelled in India knows what sort of information he gets even from\r\nthe best and most intelligent Brahmins with regard to the dates of the\r\ntemples they and their forefathers have administered in ever since\r\ntheir erection. One thousand or two or three thousand years is a\r\nmoderate age for temples which we know were certainly erected within\r\nthe last two or three centuries. Or ask any native about the date of\r\nthe rock-cut temples at Ellora or Elephanta, he at once glibly answers,\r\nthey were erected by the Pandus, 3101 B.C.; and if he breaks\r\nloose from that landmark, ten or twenty thousand years is the least you\r\ncan expect. Yet we know now, from inscriptions and other data, that no\r\nrock-cut temple can be carried further back than the second century\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\nIn this infantile state of the native mind it costs them nothing to\r\nhide their ignorance in the mists of thousands of years when questioned\r\nabout these rude stones, but their testimony is absolutely worthless,\r\nand it is only by processes like those just described that we can\r\nhope to arrive at the truth. Among races so unchangeable as some of\r\nthose existing in India they may carry us back to a time prior to\r\nthe Christian era with some classes of monuments; but, unless I am\r\nvery much mistaken, it will be found that all those mentioned in the\r\npreceding pages are of comparatively recent date and are members of an\r\nunbroken series which continues to the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF EASTERN WITH WESTERN DOLMENS.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to approach one of the most interesting, but\r\nat the same time most difficult, branches of the inquiry we are engaged\r\nupon, which is the connexion, if any, that exists between these Indian\r\nrude-stone monuments and those we find in Europe. The difficulties,\r\nhowever, do not appear to be so much inherent in the essence of the\r\nsubject as in its novelty. It has never fairly been approached by any\r\nmodern writer, and would consequently require an amount of illustration\r\nincompatible with such a work as this to make it clear, or, on the\r\nother hand, it is necessary to assume an amount of information on the\r\npart of the public which it is feared hardly anywhere exists.\r\n\r\nThe architectural evidence, as detailed in the preceding pages, seems\r\nof a nature difficult to resist. It is easy and generally correct to\r\nassume that men in certain stages of civilization will do the same\r\nthing or things, in a manner so similar that it is difficult to\r\ndiscriminate between them. There would thus be no improbability in\r\nassuming that all men would raise a mound of earth over the dead bodies\r\nof their buried ancestors, or that they would protect their bodies\r\nfrom being crushed by the superincumbent weight, by a cist or coffin\r\nmore or less artificially formed of stone or wood. It may even further\r\nbe granted that when having got so far they would naturally improve\r\nand enlarge this cist into a dolmen or chamber and provide it with an\r\nexternal entrance. All these things being found together would by no\r\nmeans prove a necessary connexion between two races using them, further\r\nthan that the races using or inventing these forms must have belonged\r\nto the same family of tomb-building ancestral-worshipping people. But\r\nwhen we find two distinct people putting this cist outside, on the\r\ntumulus in the open air, and piercing one of the slabs in it with a\r\ncircular hole 6 or 8 inches in diameter, we come to a coincidence that\r\ncan hardly be considered accidental. As there was no writing and no\r\npost, either some tribe must have migrated from the east to the west\r\nand introduced the form, or _vice versâ_, some European must have\r\ntaught the Indians the advantages of this hole, whatever they were; and\r\nhaving been once taught to adopt, they afterwards continued to employ\r\nit.\r\n\r\nA still more striking instance is that already pointed out, of the\r\ncombination of a central cistvaen containing a body inside a mound with\r\na simulated cist on the top outside, and several circles of stones on\r\nor around the mound externally. All this is so complicated and shows\r\nso much design that it cannot possibly be the result of accident,\r\nif it is found in two distinct lands. The examples quoted above are\r\nperhaps sufficient to establish this similarity, but they are only a\r\nfraction of those which might be adduced if the subject were carefully\r\nfollowed out. It evidently was much more common in the East than we\r\nhave hitherto had reason to suspect--for this reason alone, if for no\r\nother--that it continued to last so long. In this example from Burmah\r\n(woodcut No. 226) we have first an external mound encircling the tope,\r\nthen the circles of rude stones replaced by a complicated rail, and\r\nabove all, in the centre, a simulated dagoba replacing the simulated\r\ncist. These are great changes, it must be confessed, but hardly so\r\ngreat as we might expect when we consider that the Senbya dagoba was\r\nonly erected fifty-five years ago, and that the interval between it and\r\nthe rude-stone monuments is consequently considerable. Another striking\r\ninstance of the modern form this primæval sepulchre assumes is found\r\nin the celebrated tomb of Akbar the Great at Agra. There the king is\r\nburied in a vault below the level of the ground, but his simulated\r\ntomb is on the top of the pyramid, exposed to the air outside; and on\r\neach stage, externally, little pavilions replace the stones which his\r\nprogenitors had previously employed for a like purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 226. View of the Senbya Pagoda, Burmah. From a\r\nphotograph.]\r\n\r\nThese two--the holed stone and the simulated cist--are perhaps the most\r\ndirect evidences of similarity between the East and the West, but the\r\nwhole system affords innumerable points of contact, not sufficiently\r\ndistinct perhaps to quote as evidence individually, but collectively\r\nmaking up such a case that it seems very difficult to refuse to believe\r\nthat both styles were the product of one kindred race of men, and who\r\nat the time they erected them must have been more or less directly in\r\ncommunication with one another.\r\n\r\nThe literary evidence is much less complete or satisfactory. So far\r\nas I know, no paragraph has been detected in any classical authors\r\nwhich would lead us to suspect any connexion at any time between India\r\nand any country so remote from it, as France for instance, and still\r\nless with Denmark, unless it be the Woden myth belonging to the latter\r\ncountry. That, however, was either so indistinct originally, or has\r\nbeen so obscured by later additions, that it is now almost impossible\r\nto say what it is. Though so frequently insisted upon, it seems almost\r\nimpossible that by any process, the gentle ascetic Sakya Muni could\r\never have become the fierce warlike Woden, and except some nominal\r\nsimilarities there seems nothing to connect the two. It may be that at\r\nsome time about the Christian era, a chief of that name migrated from\r\nthe Crimean Bosphorus to the Baltic, and may have brought with him some\r\nAsiatic practices, but the connecting link between him and India seems\r\nwholly wanting, and not likely to be now supplied.\r\n\r\nThe one passage that seems to bear directly on the subject, strange\r\nto say, comes this time from India itself. Among the edicts that\r\nAsoka engraved on the rocks in various parts of India, the last or\r\nthirteenth is to the following effect, so far as it can be made out.\r\nIt is unfortunately the nearest to the ground, and consequently in all\r\nthe published copies appears more or less injured. Two more copies of\r\nthe edicts are known to exist,--one in the Dehra Doon, the other in\r\nOrissa: when they are copied and published, perhaps a more perfect\r\ntranslation may be possible. Meanwhile, Mr. Prinsep's translation\r\nruns thus:--\"There is not in either class of the heretics of men a\r\nprocedure marked by such grace ... nor so glorious nor friendly, nor\r\neven so extremely liberal, as Devanampiyo's (Asoka's) injunction for\r\nthe non-injury and content of living creatures.... And the Greek\r\nking besides by whom the kings of Egypt, Ptolemaios, Antigonus and\r\nMagas.... Both here and in foreign countries wherever they go, the\r\nreligious ordinances of Devanampiyo effect conversion. Conquest is\r\nof every description, but the conquest that bringeth joy, springing\r\nfrom pleasant emotion, becometh joy itself. The victory of virtue is\r\nhappiness. Such victory is desired in things of this world and things\r\nof the next world.\"[583] In other copies of this edict the names of\r\nAntiochus and Alexander are found, making five well known names, and\r\ncuriously enough all five are mentioned by Justin within a few lines of\r\none another in the last chapter of his twenty-sixth book and the first\r\nchapter of his twenty-seventh book. There is thus no doubt who the\r\nkings were, nor of more than a year as to the date of this edict, which\r\nmust have been within a year or so of 257 B.C.\r\n\r\nThe great interest, however, for our present purpose is that an Indian\r\nemperor, in the middle of the third century before Christ, should be\r\nin a condition to form an alliance with Magas of Cyrene so near the\r\nAfrican dolmen-field. As before mentioned (_ante_, p. 410), we are\r\nstill very deficient in our knowledge of the Megalithic remains of this\r\ncountry; but we do know that they exist, and that those which have been\r\nillustrated are of a singularly Indian type. It is also nearly certain\r\nthat many of the rock-cut chambers about his capital are monasteries or\r\ntemples, not tombs, as has always been too hastily assumed. Whether,\r\non further investigation, these will prove to be so essentially Indian\r\nas they at present appear to be, remains to be seen, but meanwhile the\r\npossibility of an alliance of this sort two or three centuries before\r\nChrist, takes away much of the improbability that would otherwise exist\r\nin assuming that Indian influence might have extended further westward\r\nat some subsequent period, and that the African dolmens might be proved\r\nto be allied to, and possibly contemporary with, those of India.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUDDHISM IN THE WEST.\r\n\r\nThe great basis, however, on which any proof of the existence of\r\na connexion between the East and West must eventually rest, will\r\nprobably be found in the amount of pure Buddhism which crept into\r\nChristianity in the early age of the Church. The subject has not yet\r\nbeen fairly grappled with by any one capable of doing it justice. It\r\nhas been frequently alluded to by travellers, who have been struck with\r\nresemblances which could hardly be accidental, and used sometimes by\r\nscoffers in order to depreciate Christianity; but no serious historian\r\nof the Latin Church has had sufficient knowledge of Buddhism or of its\r\nforms to be able to appreciate correctly either the extent or the cause\r\nof its introduction; and till some one does this, it will be treated by\r\nthe general reader as an idle speculation. Yet it probably is not too\r\nmuch to assert, that at least nine-tenths of the institutions and forms\r\nwhich were engrafted on pure evangelical Christianity in the middle\r\nages, are certainly derived from Buddhist sources.\r\n\r\nOf these, one of the most striking is the introduction of monastic\r\ninstitutions, which exercised so important an influence on the forms of\r\nChristianity during the whole period of the middle ages. It is in vain\r\nto look for their origin in anything that existed in Europe before the\r\nChristian era. Nothing can be more forced than the analogies it has\r\nbeen attempted to establish between the Vestal virgins and the nuns of\r\nthe middle ages, and no trace of conventual life can be found among the\r\nsemi-secular priesthood of classical times. According to the usually\r\nreceived opinion, Antony (A.D. 305[584]) was the first monk,\r\nand from him and about his time a prolific progeny are traced to the\r\nThebais, which is usually assumed to be the cradle of the institution.\r\nMonastic life was, however, absolutely antithetical to the religious\r\ninstitutions of the ancient Egyptians, amongst whom the king was high\r\npriest and god, and where civil could hardly be distinguished from\r\nreligious rank. It was equally opposed to the feelings of the Arabic\r\nor at least Semitic races, that superseded the Coptic in that country,\r\nand could consequently hardly have existed at all, unless introduced\r\nfrom some foreign source and maintained by some extraneous influence.\r\nThe Essenes are the only sect to whom in the ancient world in the\r\nWest anything like the peculiar institutions of monasticism can be\r\ntraced; but unfortunately we do not know how or when they adopted them.\r\nJosephus represents them as only one of the three principal sects into\r\nwhich the Jews in his time were divided; but the silence not only of\r\nthe Bible but of the Rabbis weakens the force of his statement, while\r\nhis unfortunate omission of the name of their Lawgiver[585] leaves us\r\nin the dark on the most essential point. That it was not Moses, whose\r\nname is usually interpolated, is quite certain. He never inculcated any\r\nsuch doctrines, and one hardly dares to suggest the Indian name, which\r\nwould clear up the whole mystery at once. Be this as it may, the sect\r\nonly arose apparently in the time of the Maccabees, and practically\r\ndisappeared with the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus; all which would\r\naccord perfectly with the hypothesis of their Indian origin, but would\r\nhardly suffice to support the idea that they were the sect from whom,\r\nin the fourth century, the Christian Church adopted the principles and\r\npractices of Asceticism.\r\n\r\nWhen from these sparse indications we turn to the East, we are met\r\nby the difficulty that none of the books we possess were reduced\r\nto writing in their present form till the time of Buddhaghosa,\r\nA.D. 412,[586] or even later; and any one who knows what\r\nwild imaginings can in the fertile East creep into works during the\r\nremodellings of a thousand years, will easily understand with what\r\ncaution they must be used. Fortunately in this instance the monuments\r\nand inscriptions come to our assistance, and we are enabled to form a\r\nfair idea of the progress of monasticism in India from what they tell\r\nus.\r\n\r\nBefore the first monuments, the books tell us of three great\r\nconvocations: the first held immediately on the death of the founder\r\nof the religion, B.C. 543, at Rajagriha; the second 100 years\r\nafterwards, at Vaisali; and the third by Asoka, 250 B.C., at\r\nPataliputta, or Patna. These we are told were attended by thousand and\r\ntens of thousands of monks.[587] But Asoka's edicts give no countenance\r\nto any such extension of the system in his day. Shortly after this,\r\nhowever, the earlier caves show cells appropriated to hermits, or\r\neven for the reunion of a limited number of monks under one roof.\r\nThese Viharas or monasteries are small at first, and insignificant as\r\ncompared with the Chaityas or church caves to which they are attached,\r\nas at Karlee, Baja, Bedsa and elsewhere; but shortly afterwards, at\r\nNassick and Jooneer, in the first or second centuries they become more\r\nimportant; and when we reach such a series as that at Ajunta or Baug,\r\nfor instance, we find the Vihara becoming all important, the Chaitya\r\nsinking into comparative insignificance. This great change took place\r\napparently about the end of the third or beginning of the fourth\r\ncentury of our era, and continued till Buddhism actually perished,\r\nsmothered under the weight of its enormously developed hierarchy some\r\nthree centuries later.\r\n\r\nThe sculptures tell the same story. There are no representations of\r\npriests in the form we afterwards find them in at Sanchi, in the first\r\ncentury of our era. Ascetics there are, dwelling in woods and lonely\r\nplaces, but not congregated in monasteries, nor jointly performing\r\nceremonies. But at Amravati, three centuries later, we have shaven\r\npriests in their distinctive robes, and every symptom of a well\r\ndeveloped system.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, it could hardly have been before the era of the Roman\r\nEmpire that these peculiar institutions penetrated to the West; nor\r\ncould they have done so during its supremacy without attracting\r\nattention. But in the great \"débacle\" which followed the change of\r\nthe seat of government and the destruction of the old faith, it is\r\neasy to see how these forms may have crept in, together with the new\r\nEastern faith, which an illiterate people were adopting, without much\r\nknowing whence it came, and without being able to discriminate what was\r\nChristian and what Buddhist in the forms or doctrines that were being\r\npresented to them.\r\n\r\nAmong the peculiarities then introduced, one of the most remarkable\r\nwas the segregation of the clergy from the laity, and the devotion\r\nof the former wholly to the performance of religious duties. Still\r\nmore so was their seclusion in monasteries, living a life of the most\r\nself-denying asceticism, subsisting almost wholly on alms, and bound\r\nby vows of poverty, chastity and temperance, to a negation of all the\r\nordinary enjoyments of life. That the two systems are identical no one\r\nhas doubted, and no one, indeed, can enter now a Buddhist monastery in\r\nthe East and watch the shaven priests in the yellow robes at matins, or\r\nat vespers, issue from their cells and range themselves on either side\r\nof a choir, on whose altar stands an image of the Queen of Heaven, or\r\nof the three precious Buddhas, and listen to their litanies, chanted\r\nin what to them is a dead or foreign tongue, without feeling that\r\nhe is looking in the East on what is externally the same as he had\r\nlong been familiar with in the West.[588] If he follows these monks\r\nback to their cells and finds them governed by a mitred abbot, and\r\nsubordinated as deacons, priests, and neophytes, learns that they are\r\nbound by vows of celibacy, live by alms, and spend their lives in a\r\ndull routine of contemplation and formal worship, he might almost fancy\r\nhe was transported back into some Burgundian convent in the middle\r\nages, unless he is prepared, like Huc and Gabet, to believe that it is\r\na phantasm conjured up by the author of all evil for the confusion of\r\nmankind. We know from the form and arrangement of the great Chaitya\r\ncaves, that these forms prevailed as early at least as the first\r\ncentury B.C., and, as they are practised without change in the\r\nEast to the present day, it seems clear that it is thence that they\r\nwere introduced into Europe.\r\n\r\nCanonization is another remarkable institution common to the Buddhist\r\nand Christian Churches, and to them only. It has frequently been\r\nattempted to draw a parallel between the demigods of Greece and Rome\r\nand the institution of Saints in the mediæval Church; but this argument\r\nhas always failed, because in fact no two institutions could in their\r\norigin be more essentially different. The minor gods of the heathen\r\npantheon, though sometimes remarkable for their prowess or virtues,\r\nwere all more or less connected by ties of blood or marriage with the\r\ngreat Olympic family, and owed their rank rather to their descent than\r\nto their merits. It is true that in later times the deification of\r\nRoman emperors and others of that class, which the abject flattery of\r\na corrupt age had introduced, was a nearer approach to the practice of\r\nBuddhism, which was then flourishing in the East, than anything before\r\nknown in the pagan world. But canonization in its purity, as practised\r\nboth in the East and West, is not to be attained through either birth\r\nor office, but by the practice of ascetic virtues on the part of the\r\nclergy, and by piety coupled with benefactions to the Church by those\r\noutside its pale. In these casteless institutions any man, however\r\nobscure his origin, by devotion to the interests of his adopted order,\r\nand the practice of the asceticism, heightened if possible by the\r\nendurance of self-inflicted tortures, might attain to Buddhahood or\r\nsaintship. But such a path to adoration in this world, or to worship\r\nhereafter, was utterly unknown in Europe until it was introduced from\r\nthe East, after the Christian era.\r\n\r\nRelic-worship is another peculiarity which the mediæval Church\r\ncertainly borrowed from the East. No tradition is more constant than\r\nthat which relates that the relics of Buddha were, after cremation,\r\ndivided into eight parts, and distributed to eight different\r\nkingdoms, and the history of some portions of these can be traced to\r\ncomparatively modern times. Perhaps too much reliance should not be\r\nplaced on these very early traditions, as no material evidence of\r\nthem exists, nor in the often-repeated assertion that Asoka built\r\n84,000 dagobas,[589] to receive relics. That he built several is quite\r\ncertain. The fact of the relics of two of the favourite disciples of\r\nBuddha--Mogalana and Sariputra--and of ten of the principal dignitaries\r\nof the Buddhist Church in the time of Asoka having been found at\r\nSanchi in topes certainly anterior to the Christian era,[590] is quite\r\nsufficient for our present purpose. As is well known, the Tooth relic,\r\nwhose history can be traced back with certainty for more than fifteen\r\ncenturies, is now worshipped under British protection in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nNo such form of worship existed in classical antiquity, nor is it quite\r\nclear how it came to be adopted by the Christian Church. Buddhism was\r\na reform of a material, ancestral-worshipping, body-respecting form\r\nof religion. The sepulchral tumulus with them became in consequence a\r\ndagoba, or relic shrine, containing a bone, or a vessel, or rag, or\r\nsomething that belonged to Buddha or some of his followers; and all\r\nthe grosser superstitions of the Turanian natives, whose faith he was\r\ntrying to elevate and refine, were sublimated into something immaterial\r\nand more pure. But Christianity never could have wanted this, and its\r\nadoption of relic worship was either a piece of blind imitation adopted\r\nwithout thinking, among other things, for which there was more excuse,\r\nor it was one of the many instances of the toleration of foreign\r\nelements which characterized the Christian priesthood in the early age\r\nof the Church.\r\n\r\nIt is as little clear when this worship was introduced as why it was\r\ndone, for Christian legends in regard to relics are not more to be\r\ndepended upon than those of the Buddhists. It could not have been\r\ncommon in the days of Clemens of Alexandria, or he would not have\r\nmentioned as a wonder that the Indians worshipped a bone enclosed in a\r\npyramid;[591] but shortly after Constantine's time the fashion became\r\nprevalent, and the miracles performed by the touch of relics became\r\none of the favourite delusions of the middle ages. If this is correct,\r\nand we are justified in assuming that the Buddhism which we find in\r\nmediæval Christianity was introduced after Constantine's time, we may\r\ntake it for granted that any influence which the East exercised on the\r\nWestern rude-stone monuments was also subsequent to that monarch's\r\nreign. If this is so, a considerable portion, at least, of those found\r\nin both countries must also belong to the dark ages that closed with\r\nthe Crusades.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to go on multiplying instances of Eastern customs\r\nintroduced into the Western Church were this the place to do it. All\r\nthat is required here, however, is to adduce sufficient evidence to\r\naccentuate an assertion which no one, probably, who knows anything of\r\nthe subject would be found to dispute. It is, that the mediæval Church\r\nborrowed many of its forms from pre-existing Buddhism, and that these\r\nwere introduced not before but after the time of Constantine. If,\r\nafter having reached conviction on this point, we turn to our books to\r\nascertain what light they throw on the subject, we find them absolutely\r\nsilent. You may wade through all the writings of the Fathers, all the\r\nponderous tomes of the Bollandists, without finding a trace, or even\r\na hinted suspicion, that such a transference of doctrine took place.\r\nExcept from one or two passages in Clemens of Alexandria, we should\r\nnot be able to show that before the time of Constantine the nations\r\nof the West knew even the name of Buddha,[592] much less anything\r\nof his doctrines. While this is so it is obviously idle to ask for\r\nwritten evidence with regard to the influence of either country on the\r\narchitectural style of the other. Men write volumes on volumes with\r\nregard to doctrines and faiths, but rarely allude to anything that\r\nconcerns mere buildings; and while written history is so absolutely\r\nsilent respecting the introduction of Buddhist forms into the West, it\r\nis in vain to hope that any allusion will be found to the influence\r\nEastern forms may have had on the sepulchral monuments of Northern\r\nAfrica or Europe. In this case, the \"litera scripta\" is not to be\r\ndepended upon, but the monuments and their inscriptions are, and it\r\nis from them and them only, that either correct dates or reliable\r\nmaterials for such an investigation can be obtained. So far as I am\r\ncapable of forming an opinion, their evidence is amply sufficient, in\r\nthe first place, to take away all _à priori_ improbability from the\r\nassumption that there may have been a direct influence exercised by\r\nthe East on the Western rude-stone monuments. But it seems to me at\r\nthe same time sufficient to render it extremely probable that while\r\ninfluencing to so great an extent the religious institutions of the\r\ncountry, they should also have modified their sepulchral forms so\r\nas fully to account for all the similarities which we find existing\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nIt may not be possible, in the present state of our knowledge, to\r\nexplain exactly how this influence was exercised, and we must,\r\nconsequently, rest content with the fact that as Buddhism did so\r\ninfluence the religion of the West in those early ages, the same agency\r\nmay equally have acted upon the architectural or sepulchral forms of\r\nthe same class in our population.\r\n\r\nTo explain this it is necessary to revert for a moment to a\r\nproposition I have often had occasion to advance, and have not yet\r\nseen refuted--that Buddhism is the religion of a Turanian race, using\r\nthat word, as used by its inventors, in the broadest possible sense.\r\nThe Persians say Iran and Turan, and Iran and Aniran, terms equivalent\r\nto our Aryan and non-Aryan; and Buddhism is not and never was, but\r\nexceptionally, the religion of the Aryan race, and is not now professed\r\nby any Aryan people in any quarter of the globe. It is essentially the\r\nfaith of a quiescent, contemplative race, with no distinct idea of a\r\ngod external to this world, or of a future state other than through\r\ntransmigrations accomplished in this world, leading only to eternal\r\nrepose hereafter; its followers, however, still believing in the direct\r\ninfluence of the temporarily-released spirits of their forefathers in\r\nguiding and controlling the destiny of their offspring, thus leading\r\ndirectly to ancestral worship. In India this primitive faith was\r\nrefined and elevated into one of the most remarkable and beneficent of\r\nhuman institutions by the Aryan Sakya Muni and his Brahmin coadjutors,\r\nand did at one time nearly obliterate the Aryan faith which it\r\nsuperseded. After, however, a thousand years of apparent supremacy,\r\nthe old faith came again to the surface and Buddhism disappeared from\r\nIndia, but still remains the only faith of all the Turanian nations\r\naround it and wherever the Aryan races never seem to have settled.\r\n\r\nIf any Turanian blood remained in the veins of any of the various races\r\nwho inhabited Europe in the middle ages, it is easy to understand how\r\nthe preaching or doctrines of any Buddhist missionaries or Turanian\r\ntribes must have struck a responsive chord in their hearts, and how\r\neasily they would have adopted any new fashion these Easterns may have\r\ntaught. As we have had occasion to point out above, the dolmen-builders\r\nof Europe certainly were not Aryan. Nor, if we may trust M. Bertrand\r\nand the best French antiquaries, were they Celts; but that an old\r\npre-Celtic people did exist in those parts of France in which the\r\ndolmens are generally found appears to me indisputable. Though the more\r\nactive and progressive Celts had commenced their obliteration of this\r\nundemonstrative people at the time when written history first began in\r\ntheir country, there is no reason to suppose that their blood or their\r\nrace was entirely exterminated till a very recent period, and it may\r\nstill have been numerically the prevalent ingredient in the population\r\nbetween the fourth and the tenth centuries of our era.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is not intended to assert or even to suggest that the\r\nWestern nations first adopted from the East the practice of using stone\r\nto accentuate and adorn their sepulchral monuments. The whole evidence\r\nof the preceding pages contradicts such an assumption. But what they\r\ndo seem to have borrowed is the use or abuse of holed stones, and the\r\narrangement of external dolmens on the summit of tumuli combined with\r\ntwo or three circles of rude stones. These I fancy to have been among\r\nthe latest of the forms which rude-stone architecture adopted, and may\r\nvery well have been introduced in post-Constantinian times; and when we\r\nbecome more familiar with the peculiarities of these monuments, both in\r\nthe East and the West, there may be other forms which we may recognize\r\nas modern and interchangeable, while many others, such as the great\r\nchambered tumuli and the tall solitary menhirs, seem as original and as\r\npeculiar to the West.\r\n\r\nHaving now made the tour of the Old World, it will be convenient to\r\ntry to resume, in as few words as possible, the principal results we\r\nhave arrived at from the preceding investigation.\r\n\r\nFirst, with regard to their age. It seems that the uncivilized,\r\nancestral-worshipping races of Europe first borrowed from the\r\nRomans--or, if any one likes, from the Phœnicians or Greeks of\r\nMarseilles--the idea of using stone to accentuate and adorn the\r\nmonuments of their dead. In like manner, it certainly was from the\r\nBactrian Greeks that the Indians first learned the use of stone as a\r\nbuilding material. How early the Eastern nations adopted it in its rude\r\nform we do not know. In its polished form it was used as early as the\r\nmiddle of the third century B.C., but we have no authentic instance\r\nof the rude form till at least a century or two after Christ; but,\r\nonce introduced, its use continued to the present day. Its history\r\nin the West seems somewhat different. The great chambered tumuli at\r\nGavr Innis, and others in France, as well as those at Lough Crew, in\r\nIreland, seem to belong to a time before the Romans occupied the states\r\nof Western Europe; but no stone monument of this class has yet made\r\nout its claim to an antiquity of more than two centuries, if so much,\r\nbefore the Christian era. Some of those in Greece about Mycenæ, and\r\nthose at Saturnia, may be earlier, but they are as yet undescribed\r\nscientifically, and we cannot tell. From shortly before the Christian\r\nera, till the countries in which they are found became entirely and\r\nessentially Christian, the use of these monuments seems to have been\r\ncontinual, whenever a dolmen-building race--or, in other words, a race\r\nwith any taint of Turanian blood in their veins--continued to prevail.\r\nThis, in remote corners of the world, seems to have extended in France\r\nand Britain down to the eighth or ninth century. In Scandinavia\r\nit lasted down to the eleventh or twelfth, and sporadically, in\r\nout-of-the-way and neglected districts, as late both in France and\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nThese results do not, of course, touch the age of the earthen tumuli\r\nor barrows, for the determination of whose age no scale has yet been\r\ninvented; still less do they approach the question of the antiquity of\r\nthe Cave men or the palæolithic stone implements, the age of which we\r\nmust, for the present at least, leave wrapped in the mists of the long\r\nprehistoric past.\r\n\r\nTheir uses seem more easily determined than their dates; with only a\r\nfew rare and easily-recognizable exceptions, all seem originally to\r\nhave been intended for sepulchral or cenotaphic purposes. Either, like\r\nthe great chambered tumuli and the dolmens, they were actually the\r\nburying-places of the illustrious dead; or, like the greater circles\r\nand the alignments, they marked battle-fields, and were erected in\r\nhonour of those slain there, whether their bodies were actually laid\r\nwithin their precincts or not; or, like the rude stone pillars of the\r\nKhassia hills, they were offerings to the spirits of the departed.\r\n\r\nWith the fewest possible exceptions[593] and these of the most\r\ninsignificant character, their connexion with the relics of the dead\r\ncan be proved from all having become places for ancestral worship and\r\nhaving under various forms been used for commemorating or honouring\r\ndeparted spirits. No single instance has been authenticated of either\r\ncircles or dolmens in any other form, except perhaps single stones,\r\nhaving ever been used for the worship of Odin, or of the gods called\r\nMercury, Mars, Venus, or the other gods of the Druids, still less\r\nis there any trace of the worship of the sun or moon or any of the\r\nheavenly host; nor, I am sorry to think, can the serpent lay claim to\r\nany temple of this class. Honour to the dead and propitiation of the\r\nspirits of the departed seem to have been the two leading ideas that\r\nboth in the East and West gave rise to the erection of these hitherto\r\nmysterious structures which are found numerously scattered over the\r\nface of the Old World.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 531: 'History of Architecture,' by the Author, ii. p.\r\n    459, fig. 968.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 532: 'Caves of Baja and Bedsa in Western Ghâts;'\r\n    unpublished.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 533: 'Tree and Serpent Worship,' quotation from Hiouen\r\n    Thsang, p. 135, and plates, _passim_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 534: 'History of Architecture,' by the Author, ii. p.\r\n    649.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 535: 'Architecture of Ahmedabad.' 120 photographs, with\r\n    text.

In the form that it has now\r\ntaken, however, nothing more is required than to point out as briefly\r\nas possible what the American monuments really are, with sufficient\r\ndetail to show whether they have or have not any connexion with those\r\nwe have been describing, and to point out what bearing--if any--their\r\npeculiarities may have on the main argument of this work.\r\n\r\nIn so far as the rude monuments of North America are concerned, there\r\nis fortunately no difficulty in speaking with confidence. In the\r\nfirst volume of the 'Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,'[594]\r\nthe Americans possess a detailed description of their antiquities of\r\nthis class such as no nation in Europe can boast of. The survey was\r\ncarefully and scientifically carried out by Messrs. Squier and Davis,\r\nto whom it was entrusted. The text is tersely and clearly written,\r\nmere theories or speculations are avoided, and the plates are clearly\r\nand carefully engraved. If we had such a work on our own antiquities\r\nwe should long ago have known all about them; but unfortunately there\r\nare no Smithsons in this country, and among our thousand and one\r\nmillionaires, to whom the expense would be a flea-bite, there is not\r\none who has the knowledge requisite to enable him to appreciate the\r\nvalue of such a survey, nor consequently the liberality sufficient to\r\ninduce him to incur the expense necessary for its execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWith this work before us, we feel justified in making the assertion\r\nthat there are no rude-stone monuments on the continent of North\r\nAmerica. There are extensive earth works of nearly all the classes\r\nfound in the Old World, and some--especially the animal forms--which\r\nare peculiar to the New.\r\n\r\nThese earthworks Messrs. Squier and Davis classify as follows (page\r\n7):--\r\n\r\n  1. Enclosures for defence.\r\n  2. Sacred and miscellaneous enclosures.\r\n  3. Mounds of sacrifice.\r\n  4. Mounds of sepulture.\r\n  5. Temple mounds.\r\n  6. Animal mounds.\r\n\r\nWith the first we have nothing to do: they are similar to those erected\r\neverywhere and in all ages of the world. They consist of a ditch, the\r\nearth taken in forming which is thrown up on its inner side, so as to\r\nform an obstacle to the advance of an enemy, and to become a shelter to\r\nthe defenders. Some of these in America are of great extent, and show\r\nnot only considerable proficiency in the art of defence, but indicate\r\nthe presence of an extensive and settled population. The so-called\r\n\"sacred enclosures\" are not only numerous and extensive, but are unlike\r\nanything met with elsewhere. In Ross county alone our authors state\r\nthat there are 100 at least of various sizes, and in the State of Ohio\r\n1000 to 1500, some of them enclosing areas from 100 to 200 acres in\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 227. Enclosure in Newark Works.]\r\n\r\nTheir typical form will be understood from the annexed woodcut. All\r\nseem to have a forecourt either square or octagonal in form, with 4\r\nor 8 entrances to it, and beyond this is a circle generally quite\r\ncomplete, and entered only by a passage or opening from the forecourt.\r\nThese are enclosed by earthen mounds varying from 5 to 30 feet in\r\nheight, with the ditch almost invariably on the inside.\r\n\r\nThe last peculiarity is in itself, as in the case of the English\r\ncircles, quite sufficient to preclude the idea of their being\r\nfortifications or meant for defence, and they certainly are not\r\nsepulchral in any sense in which we understand the term. In the first\r\nplace, because we know perfectly what the sepulchres of these people\r\nwere, from the thousands and tens of thousands of tumuli which dot the\r\nplains everywhere; but also because, unlike the English circles, which\r\nare as a rule found in the most remote and barren spots, these American\r\nenclosures as generally occupy the flattest and richest spots in the\r\ncountry. They are most frequently situated near the rivers, and on the\r\nnatural lines of communication; so much so indeed that many of the\r\ncities of the present occupants of the country stand on the same spots\r\nand within the enclosures of the earlier races who raised these mounds.\r\n\r\nWe are thus left to the choice between two hypotheses. Either they\r\nare sacred enclosures, as suggested by our authors, or they are royal\r\nresidences--temples or palaces.\r\n\r\nAll the arguments, derived from its excessive size, that were urged\r\nagainst Avebury being a temple, apply with redoubled force to these\r\nAmerican enclosures. Temples occupying 50 to 100 acres are certainly\r\nsingular anomalies when we try to realise what these admeasurements\r\nimply. Our largest square, Lincoln's Inn Fields, occupies only 12\r\nacres; the Green Park is 53; and all our parks together do not occupy\r\nthe same space as the Newark enclosures, which, according to Messrs.\r\nSquier and Davis, cover more than four square miles.[595] Yet all these\r\nare circles and squares with connecting lines, and all with inside\r\nditches. Temples of these dimensions, without divisions, or enclosures,\r\nor mounds, or permanent works of any kind, are anomalies difficult to\r\nunderstand, and must belong to some religion of which I, at least, have\r\nno knowledge; and no one, so far as I know, has yet suggested what\r\nthat religion was, nor how these vast spaces could be utilized for any\r\nreligious purpose.\r\n\r\nIf we adopt the idea that they were the residences of the chiefs of\r\nthe people, the mystery does not seem so great. If the circular wigwam\r\nof the chief was erected in the centre of the circles, and the wigwams\r\nof his subordinates and retainers in concentric circles around him,\r\nit would account for their dimensions, and also for the disappearance\r\nof all traces of habitation. The forecourt would thus be the place of\r\nassembly of the tribe, the exercise ground or gymnasium, and for such\r\npurposes it is admirably adapted, and both the size and the situation\r\nof these enclosures seem easily explicable.\r\n\r\nOne curious circumstance tends to render this view more tenable. On\r\nplate xxi. of Messrs. Squier and Davis's work four groups of squares\r\nwith circles are delineated, situated in different parts of the\r\ncountry; but all the four squares are almost identical in size, each\r\nside measuring 1080 feet. Why four temples should be exactly alike is a\r\nmystery, but that a tetrarchy of chiefs should be bound down to equal\r\ndimensions for their rival residences seems reasonable from a civil\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem difficult to explain the meaning of the inside ditch\r\nwhen fortification was not intended, as it must have been almost a\r\nnecessity with a people who had not arrived at the elevation of using\r\nbrick drains or drain-pipes. Without some such arrangement all the\r\nrain that fell within these solid enclosures would have remained on\r\nthe surface, or in the squares could only have escaped through the\r\nopenings, but a deep and broad ditch all round would drain the whole\r\nsurface without inconvenience, and secure the only mode which would\r\nprevent the enclosure, be it a temple or palace, from becoming a swamp.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMessrs. Squier and Davis divide the conical mounds which they excavated\r\ninto two classes. The first they call \"Mounds of sacrifice,\" because\r\non digging into them they found on the level of the soil what appeared\r\nto be altars--raised floors which exhibited evidence of intense heat,\r\nand what they considered a long-continued practice of burning. It is\r\nevident, however, that such results might be produced in a week as well\r\nas in years, and it is very difficult to understand why at any time\r\nthat which had been an altar should be buried in a tumulus. If it had\r\nbeen used for years, why, and on what occasion, was it agreed to bury\r\nit? If it was the funereal pyre of some chief, and used for burning\r\nsacrifices for the time the funeral services lasted, and was then\r\nburied, the case is intelligible enough, but the other hypothesis is\r\ncertainly not easy of explanation.\r\n\r\nThe true \"Sepulchral mounds\" are, as before mentioned, immensely\r\nnumerous, and of all sizes, from a few feet up to such as the Grave\r\nCreek mound, 70 feet high and 1000 feet in circumference, or that at\r\nMiamisburgh, 68 feet high, and 852 feet in circumference at its base.\r\nThe dead were buried in them apparently without coffins or cists,\r\nunless of wood, and generally in the contracted doubled-up position\r\nfound so frequently in Scandinavia and in Algeria.\r\n\r\nThe \"Temple mounds\" are generally square or oblong truncated pyramids,\r\nwith inclined planes leading up to them on three and frequently on all\r\nfour sides. They are in fact in earth the same form as the Teocallis\r\nof the Mexicans, though the latter seem always to have been in stone.\r\nWhether in the one material or the other, they are of a perfectly\r\nintelligible templar form. If a human sacrifice or any great ceremonial\r\nis to take place before all the people, the first requisite is an\r\nelevated platform where the ministrants can stand above the heads of\r\nthe crowd, and be seen by all; and the absence of this in the Ohio\r\nand in our English circles is one of the most fatal objections to the\r\ntemple theory. In one or two instances a single earthen Teocalli is\r\nfound within the circles, but this no further militates against the\r\nsupposition that they were residences than the presence of a chapel or\r\nplace of worship in any of our palaces would prove them to be temples\r\nalso. It must, however, be borne in mind that it is always difficult to\r\ndraw a hard and fast line between the House of God and the Palace of\r\nthe King. In Egypt it is never possible, and in the middle ages royal\r\nmonasteries and royal residences were frequently interchangeable terms.\r\nWe should not therefore feel surprised if, in America, we found the\r\none fading into the other. But, on the whole, the enormous number of\r\nthese circular enclosures--1000 and 1500 in one State--their immense\r\nsize, 100 and 200 acres being not unfrequent, and the general absence\r\nof all signs of preparations for worship, seem sufficient to prove that\r\nthey must be classed among civil and not among sacred erections. This\r\nseems to be the case even though sometimes three or four temple mounds\r\nare found together surrounded by a rampart just sufficient to enclose\r\nthem with the necessary space for circulation all round; in which case,\r\nhowever, it is evident that they have passed the line separating the\r\ntwo divisions, and may, probably must, be classified as really sacred\r\nenclosures. These are generally found in the South, in Texas, and in\r\nthe States most nearly bordering on Mexico, which looks as if they\r\nbelonged to another race more nearly allied to the Toltecs or Aztecs\r\nthan to the northern tribes.\r\n\r\nThe only remaining class of mounds are those representing \"Animals,\"\r\nto which plates xxxv. to xliv. of Messrs. Squier and Davis's book are\r\ndevoted. One of these, our authors have no doubt, represents a serpent\r\n700 feet long as he lies with his tail curled up into a spiral form,\r\nand his mouth gaping to swallow an egg (?) 160 feet long by 60 feet\r\nacross. This at first sight looks so like one of Stukeley's monstrous\r\ninventions that the first impulse is to reject it as an illusion on the\r\npart of the surveyors. When, however, we bear in mind that the American\r\nmound-builders did represent not only men, but animals, quadrupeds,\r\nand lizards, in the same manner, and on the same relative scale, all\r\nimprobability vanishes. At the same time the simple fact that the form\r\nis so easily recognisable here is in itself sufficient to prove that\r\nour straight-lined stone rows were not erected with any such intention,\r\nand could only be converted into Dracontia by the most perverted\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nThough therefore we may assume that this mound really represents a\r\nserpent, it by no means follows that it was an idol or was worshipped.\r\nIt seems to represent an action--the swallowing of something, but\r\nwhether a globe or a grave is by no means clear, and must be left for\r\nfurther investigation. It is, however, only by taking it in connection\r\nwith the other animal mounds in America that we can hope to arrive at a\r\nsolution. They were not apparently objects of worship, and seem to have\r\nno connexion with anything found in the Old World.\r\n\r\nThe other mounds representing quadrupeds are quite unmistakable: they\r\nare a freak of this people whoever they were. But it seems difficult to\r\nexplain why they should take this Brobdignagian way of representing the\r\nanimals they possessed, or were surrounded by. If we knew more of the\r\npeople, or of their affinities, perhaps the solution would be easy; at\r\npresent it hardly interests us, as we have no analogue in Europe.[596]\r\n\r\nIt only now remains to try and ascertain if any connexion exists\r\nor existed between these American monuments and those of the Old\r\nWorld; and what light, if any, their examination may be expected to\r\nthrow on the problems discussed in the preceding chapters. If it is\r\nwished to establish anything like a direct connexion between the two\r\ncontinents, we must go back to the far distant prehistoric times when\r\nthe conformations of land and water were different from what they\r\nnow are. No one, I presume, will be found to contend that, since the\r\ncontinents took their present shape, any migration across the Atlantic\r\ntook place in such numbers as to populate the land, or to influence the\r\nmanners or customs of the people previously existing there. It may be\r\nthat the Scandinavians did penetrate in the tenth or eleventh centuries\r\nto Vinland, by the way of Greenland, and so anticipated the discovery\r\nof Columbus by some centuries;[597] but this is only a part of that\r\nworld-pervading energy of the Aryan races, and has nothing whatever\r\nto do with the people of the tumuli. If any connexion really existed\r\nbetween the Old and the New World, in anything like historic times,\r\neverything would lead us to believe that it took place _viâ_ Behring\r\nStrait or the Aleutian Islands. It seems reasonable to suppose that the\r\npeople who covered the Siberian Steppes with tumuli may have migrated\r\nacross the calm waters of the Upper Pacific, and gradually extended\r\nthemselves down to Wisconsin and Ohio, and there left these memorials\r\nwe now find. It may also be admitted that the same Asiatic people may\r\nhave spread westward from the original hive, and been the progenitors\r\nof those who covered our plains with barrows, but beyond this no\r\nconnexion seems to be traceable which would account for anything we\r\nfind. Nowhere, however, in America do these people ever seem to have\r\nrisen to the elevation of using even rude stones to adorn their tombs\r\nor temples. Nor do they appear to have been acquainted with the use of\r\niron or of bronze; all the tools found in their tombs being of pure\r\nunalloyed native copper--both of which circumstances seem to separate\r\nthese American mound-builders entirely from our rude-stone people in\r\nanything like historic times.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, also, the study of the manners and customs of the\r\nRedmen, who occupied North America when we first came in contact with\r\nthem, is not at all likely to throw any light on the subject. They\r\nhave never risen beyond the condition of hunters, and have no settled\r\nplaces of abode, and possess no works of art. The mound-builders, on\r\nthe contrary, were a settled people, certainly pastoral, probably to\r\nsome extent even agricultural; they had fixed well chosen unfortified\r\nabodes, altogether exhibiting a higher state of civilization than we\r\nhave any reason to suppose the present race of Redmen ever reached or\r\nare capable of reaching.\r\n\r\nAlthough, therefore, it seems in vain to look on the Red Indians who\r\nin modern times occupied the territories of Ohio and Wisconsin as the\r\ndescendants of the mound-builders, there are tribes on the west coast\r\nof America that probably are, or rather were, very closely allied to\r\nthem. The Hydahs and the natives inhabiting Vancouver's Island and\r\nQueen Charlotte's Sound seem both from their physical condition, and\r\nmore so from their works of art, to be just such a people as one would\r\nexpect the mound-builders to have been. If this is so, it again points\r\nto Northern Asia, and not to Europe, as the country where we must\r\nlook for the origin of this mysterious people; and it is there, I am\r\nconvinced, if anywhere, that the solution of our difficulties with\r\nregard to this phase of North American civilization is to be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL AMERICA.\r\n\r\nWhen we advance a little farther south, we meet in Mexico and Yucatan\r\nwith phenomena which are the exact converse of those in Ohio and\r\nWisconsin. There everything is in stone; earth either never being\r\nused, or, if employed at all, it was only as a core to what was faced\r\nor intended to be faced with the more durable material. There is one\r\nfact, however, which takes the Mexican monuments entirely out of the\r\ncategory of the works contemplated in this book. All the stones in\r\nCentral America are carved. So far as is known, no rude stones were\r\never set up there, even the obelisks which stand alone, and look most\r\nlike our menhirs in outline, are, like the Babas of the Steppes, all\r\ncarved, most of them elaborately; and though it may be true that they\r\nmay, at some remote period, have been derived from some such rude\r\noriginals as are found in Europe, still till we find some traces of\r\nthese in Central America they cannot be said to belong to the class\r\nof monuments of which we are now treating; nor can they be used as\r\naffording any analogies or illustrations which it would be worth while\r\nciting in this place.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERU.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks apply to what we find in Peru with equal force, but\r\nnot with equal distinctness. No one will, I presume, contend that there\r\nwas any direct communication between Europe and the west coast of South\r\nAmerica before the time of Columbus. Yet there are similarities between\r\nthe masonry of the Peruvian monuments and those of the Pelasgi in\r\nGreece and Tyrrheni in Italy which are most striking, and can only be\r\naccounted for, at present, on the assumption that nations in the same\r\nstage of civilization, and using similar materials, arrive nearly at\r\nthe same results. Perhaps we ought to add to this, provided they have\r\nsome taint of the same blood in their veins; and that, in this case,\r\ndoes not seem absolutely improbable.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, there are, so far as I know, no rude-stone monuments\r\nin Southern America. The ruins, for instance, of Tia Huanaco, which\r\nhave often been quoted for their similarity to \"Druidical remains,\"\r\nare as far removed as possible from that category. It is true that\r\nthere are rows of squared stones that now stand apart, and in imperfect\r\ndrawings look like our menhirs enclosing a square or circular space.\r\nIn reality, however, as we learn from photographs, they are carefully\r\nsquared stones, which formed pilasters in walls constructed with\r\nAdobes, or imperfectly burned bricks, or smaller stones which have been\r\nremoved.[598] The doorways which led into this enclosure are hewn out\r\nof a single block of stone, and are more carefully cut and polished\r\nthan anything else to be found anywhere out of Egypt, and there only in\r\nthe best days of her great Pharaohs.\r\n\r\nThe same remarks may apply to the circles and squares illustrated by\r\nMr. Squier.[599] I may be mistaken, but my impression is that like\r\nHouel's Druidical circles in Gozo, above alluded to, they are only the\r\nfoundation courses of square and circular buildings, the upper parts of\r\nwhich have perished. At all events, till they are excavated, or some\r\ntraditional or real use is found for them, I should be very unwilling\r\nto base any argument on their accidental similarity with our stone\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that these earthen mounds and primitive carved\r\nstones of the American continent form in themselves a most interesting\r\ngroup of monuments, well deserving more attention than has yet been\r\nbestowed upon them, and that, when properly investigated, they will\r\nthrow more light on the origin and migrations of the various aboriginal\r\nraces of that country than can be expected from any other source.\r\nThey are not, however, of the class we are treating of, nor do they\r\nseem to have any direct connexion with those of the Old World. As,\r\nbesides this, their examination does not promise to solve any of our\r\ndifficulties, they do not necessarily occupy an extended space in\r\na work devoted to the elucidation of the Use and Age of Rude-Stone\r\nMonuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 594: 'Ancient Monuments in the Mississippi Valley;'\r\n    Philadelphia, 1847.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 595: 'Ancient Monuments,' &c., p. 49.

ANTRIM,\r\n\r\n  _August 18, 1871_.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--I was unable to get to Glen Columbkille till\r\n  this week, and I am afraid that I shall be too late to be of use\r\n  to you. As, however, I did not forget to examine the monuments, I\r\n  send the notes I made on them. All were written down at the stones\r\n  themselves. Glen Columbkille is about 4 miles long and 3 broad. Its\r\n  eastern boundary is a steep rocky mountain, from which the floor of\r\n  the glen slopes down to the sea, and ends westward in Glen Bay. Glen\r\n  Bay is of considerable width from its southern point, Rossan, to its\r\n  northern, Glen Head, but it has only a short beach. There is also\r\n  a dangerous bar, so that it is an almost impossible landing-place\r\n  except for curraghs, and in smooth weather for boats. The north side\r\n  of Glen Columbkille is rocky and steep, and is chiefly formed by the\r\n  mountain Ballard. The south side, though in parts precipitous, and\r\n  nowhere a very gradual slope, is not so steep as its opposite. The\r\n  coast south and north of Glen Bay for miles is a range of cliffs, of\r\n  from 1900 to 100 feet, with here and there a small beach, but no safe\r\n  landing-places. South of Glen Columbkille is a smaller and shallower\r\n  valley, Glen Malin. The sides of Glen Malin are all gradual; its\r\n  coast is precipitous; on the south it is bounded by a mountain of\r\n  large base, Leathan. Both Glen Columbkille and Glen Malin are in the\r\n  parish of Glen Columbkille and barony of Banagh. Most of the great\r\n  stone structures are in Glen Malin.\r\n\r\n  The monuments are of three kinds: (1) cromlechs;[600] (2) stone\r\n  chambers; (3) solitary stones. They are in groups of various size and\r\n  compactness. There are five distinct groups, a considerable distance\r\n  apart, and with no apparent connexion of arrangement. Three groups\r\n  are on the north and two on the south side of the glen. The stones in\r\n  each have been more or less disturbed, and have been made to serve\r\n  in lime-kilns and byres and as malt stores. While examining one set,\r\n  I felt my foot sink, and, lifting the edge of a piece of heather,\r\n  found an excavation filled with barley, soaking. On getting into\r\n  another cavity, I found two black lambs inside, and in another some\r\n  pigs, in another calves. The most remarkable general feature of the\r\n  architecture that I noticed was that the stones in each group were\r\n  much of a size, but that in some groups they were a good deal larger\r\n  than in others. I shall speak of the groups as they are marked by\r\n  letters in a plan I made for my own use on the spot.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: 228. Plan of the Uprights of Cromlech D I.]\r\n\r\n  D. This group, which is that nearest the sea on the south side of the\r\n  river, consists of six cromlechs, arranged in line, with considerable\r\n  intervals. A few yards west of this group are several mounds of\r\n  stones with some large blocks amongst them, but no blocks more than 4\r\n  feet long. These extend for some 50 yards in line from west to east.\r\n  A few yards above them is a large pile of stones, in the midst of\r\n  which is a stone 6 feet high and 3 feet wide. These heaps have been\r\n  augmented by stones collected from the fields, but I think there are\r\n  indications that they were originally of the nature of the cromlechs.\r\n\r\n  There are six cromlechs, and from the first the other five are in\r\n  sight. The line in which they are placed along the glen side is not\r\n  quite straight. The westernmost cromlech is some yards south of the\r\n  others, and the west to east line is not exact with regard to the\r\n  others, but is nowhere so much departed from as with the first pile.\r\n  The first is about half a mile from the sea. I shall describe them\r\n  from west to east.\r\n\r\n  I. This was a cromlech of five huge stones and a top. The top stone\r\n  has fallen to westward, and the uprights are all somewhat displaced.\r\n  Three of the upright stones are still erect; two are fallen, but not\r\n  quite to the ground. At the west end are some smaller blocks and\r\n  another slab. These are hidden by small stones and earth; I think\r\n  there were two support stones and a slab. After examining all the\r\n  monuments of the two glens, I came to the conclusion that this (D I.)\r\n  was a cromlech with a stone chamber beside it. There is a space 2\r\n  feet 6 inches wide between the two tallest uprights. The annexed plan\r\n  shows the arrangement of the uprights. The top slab has fallen over\r\n  _e_; _d_ and _e_ are fallen; _a_, _b_, and _c_ are upright, but slant\r\n  more or less. The dimensions are:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Ft. In.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Height              12   9    (_a_) slants somewhat to\r\n      Breadth                9   4  westward; the height from its tip\r\n      Thickness(about)       3   0   to the ground is 10 feet 2 inches.\r\n      Widest girth          23   0\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Height               7   5    (_b_) from tip perpendicular\r\n      Breadth                4   3  the height is 6 feet 6 inches.\r\n      Thickness              2   0\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Height               7   0\r\n      Breadth                2  10\r\n      Thickness              1   0\r\n\r\n  (_d_) Length              10   0\r\n      Breadth                5   0\r\n      Thickness              2   0\r\n\r\n  (_e_) Length               7   0    (_e_) is hard to measure, as it\r\n                                    lies under earth, stones, and the\r\n                                     top slab.\r\n\r\n  All these are of a gritty stone, veined with quartz, a rock plentiful\r\n  in Sliabh Liag, Sliabh Leathan, and the cliffs of the coast. Their\r\n  shape is rugged.\r\n\r\n  The top slab is of pure quartz. It is about a foot thick, and is\r\n  smooth on both sides. This sort of stone splits with a smooth\r\n  surface, as may be seen on Sliabh Liag and in some of the cliffs.\r\n  The slab is a tolerably regular oblong, 9 feet 8 inches by 6 feet 6\r\n  inches. The smaller slab alluded to above, and which was, I think,\r\n  the top of the chamber, is about 6 feet by 3 feet.\r\n\r\n  D II. lies about 40 feet east of D I. It, too, is a cromlech, but the\r\n  stones of which it is built are of smaller size than those of D I.\r\n  There are no traces of a chamber, but otherwise it is constructed as\r\n  D I. The highest standing stone is 4 feet high. There seem to have\r\n  been five uprights. The top slab has fallen to the west side. It\r\n  measures 6 feet 3 inches by 5 feet.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n  229. Plan showing the actual position of the Stones of D III.  ]\r\n\r\n  D III. is situate 55 feet east of D II. It is a cromlech of five\r\n  uprights and one slab. One upright only is erect now. Its height is 5\r\n  feet, its width 3 feet. The slab which was atop is 8 feet by 7 feet,\r\n  and averages 2 feet in thickness.\r\n\r\n  D IV. is 31 feet east of D III. It is a small-sized cromlech. The\r\n  uprights are all fallen. The slab measures 6 feet 8 inches by 6 feet.\r\n  A series of low mounds with large stones sticking out here and there\r\n  forms a sort of connexion with the next cromlech, which stands 48\r\n  feet farther east.\r\n\r\n  D V. Its slab has fallen to eastward, and the uprights in several\r\n  directions. The tallest upright is 6 feet high. The slab is of\r\n  quartz, and measures 10 feet by 7 feet, and is about 13 inches thick.\r\n  Around this cromlech are numbers of loose stones. They are from 1\r\n  foot to 2 feet long, and are of mica-schist and quartz. They are not\r\n  such as would be picked off the meadow, and seem to have been in some\r\n  way connected with the cromlech.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: 230. Plan (excl. Top Slab).]\r\n\r\n  D VI. stands 96 feet farther east. It is a very large cromlech. It is\r\n  a good deal fallen; all the stones of which it is built have more or\r\n  less the character of slabs. It is used as one side of a respectable\r\n  byre. One great smooth piece of quartz seems to have been the roof.\r\n  It measures 18 feet 7 inches by 11 feet. The biggest of the stones\r\n  seems to have formed the east wall of the chamber. Its dimensions are\r\n  12 feet by 14 feet, and it is 4 feet thick. I took the dimensions of\r\n  three others:--1. Length 5 feet 6 inches, width 4 feet; 2. Length 11\r\n  feet, width 8 feet; 3. Length 9 feet, width 3 feet, thickness 3 feet.\r\n\r\n  From the flat nature of the component stones, the chamber inside\r\n  would have had few gaps in its walls. Near this cromlech is a low\r\n  stony mound.\r\n\r\n  From a few yards east of D VI. a ridge runs slantwise up the side\r\n  of Leathan. Many stones stick up out of it, but I could make out no\r\n  arrangement. The highest projecting stone is not 4 feet high. This\r\n  ridge is about a quarter of a mile long. It might be natural, but it\r\n  has very much the look of a human work. Some 150 yards up the ridge\r\n  I noticed a slab projecting from the heather. It might possibly be\r\n  the top of a chamber, of which the walls are beneath the earth. This\r\n  seeming road does not lead to another group of stones, but disappears\r\n  a short way up the mountain side. Near the mountain top there is a\r\n  small bare cliff, the only bare bit of rock on the otherwise smooth\r\n  slopes of Leathan. The rock exposed is quartz, and the position of\r\n  the little cliff leads one at a glance to imagine that it may have\r\n  been the quarry whence the slabs were brought. In this case the ridge\r\n  may have been the road down the mountain. When one goes up to the\r\n  crag, it looks less like a quarry than from below, but at the same\r\n  time I could perceive no geological reason for the exposure of so\r\n  small a surface of rock.\r\n\r\n  Some distance up Glen Malin, and on the same side of the river as D,\r\n  but not in sight from it, is another group, E, of stone monuments.\r\n\r\n  The large stones of this group are surrounded by numbers of rough,\r\n  weather-worn stone blocks, averaging 2 feet in length. The monuments\r\n  seem to be all cromlechs or chambers, and, as far as I could tell,\r\n  are about a dozen in number. One cromlech stands a good deal higher\r\n  than the rest. West of it are two stony mounds; these seem to have\r\n  been chambers. They are built of long flat slabs, with similar slabs\r\n  at the ends and top.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: 231. Plan of the Arrangement of the Cromlechs of Group\r\n  E.\r\n  _a._ Eastmost one.\r\n  _b._ Highest.\r\n  _c_, _d_. Mounds.]\r\n\r\n  The ground beyond the cromlechs is moorland, and without loose\r\n  stones. The stony area is oval, and measures east to west 130 feet,\r\n  north to south 50 to 60 feet.\r\n\r\n  All the cromlechs are about the same size. In the construction\r\n  of all, the aim seems to have been a well shut-in chamber. The\r\n  easternmost one is a chamber 9 feet 10 inches long. At each end it\r\n  has a flat stone 3 feet high. The side stones are 7½ feet long\r\n  and 3 feet high The width of the chamber is 4 feet 6 inches. At each\r\n  side, and at each end, are heaps of loose small stones. The top slab\r\n  is about 1 foot thick, and is almost a square of 9 feet.\r\n\r\n  On the north side of Glen Malin, there are three groups:--\r\n\r\n  A. This, which is the group furthest from the sea, is of five or six\r\n  cromlechs, but only one is in good preservation. It consists of a\r\n  slab resting on four flat blocks, and encloses a chamber. The side\r\n  stones are each 5 feet 8 inches long. This group stands on a small\r\n  flat piece of ground below a crag and above a stream. Leading from the\r\n  chamber there seems to have been a passage, the sides of which were\r\n  formed of slabs of stone, of which a few remain.\r\n\r\n  Some distance lower down the glen, on the north side, is a solitary\r\n  pointed stone. It is 6 feet 1 inch high, and its girth is 5 feet 5\r\n  inches. Higher on the slope by 110 feet, and 18 feet farther west,\r\n  group B begins.\r\n\r\n  B. The first of this group is a chamber cromlech. It is much buried\r\n  in the heather. Some loose stones lie around the cromlech. What seems\r\n  to have been the top slab is 10 feet across and nearly square, and 2\r\n  feet thick. One of the side slabs of the chamber is 10 feet 8 inches\r\n  by 4 feet. The tallest stone is at the east end, and is in height 6\r\n  feet 8 inches. Lower down the slope, below this cromlech, are several\r\n  low mounds, from which there are no projecting stones; 200 yards west\r\n  in a straight line is a huge cromlech. It seems to have consisted of\r\n  a gigantic slab, supported on three upright stones, not forming a\r\n  closed chamber. The top slab is still on its supports; it is 3 feet\r\n  thick, and measures 13 feet by 10 feet 9 inches. The tallest of the\r\n  uprights is 9 feet high, and is rather pointed at top. The third\r\n  upright seems to have been broken into several pieces. Some 10 yards\r\n  from this is another cromlech of equal dimensions, and a little south\r\n  of these several large loose stones are lying on the ground. Forty\r\n  yards west is a chamber cromlech of small dimensions, and near it are\r\n  many mounds with stones projecting, possibly artificial.\r\n\r\n  C. This group is some distance farther down on the same side of the\r\n  glen; it consists of two cromlechs, separated by a short ridge, so\r\n  that I think they are really parts of one structure. The eastern part\r\n  is fallen; it consists of three uprights and a top slab. The western\r\n  part consists of two stones leaning gablewise against one another.\r\n  Between the two there is a short ridge, from which several stones\r\n  stick out. Each of the western pair of stones is about 7 feet high\r\n  by 6 feet broad. The dimensions of the eastern part of the monument\r\n  are:--Top slab, 11 feet by 7 feet; thickness, 1½ foot. Uprights:\r\n  (_a_) 8 feet (and I think 2 feet below ground) by 7 feet 7 inches\r\n  broad; 2 feet 3 inches thick. (_b_) 9 feet 6 inches by 2 feet 8\r\n  inches; thickness 2 feet 5 inches, (_c_) 9 feet 6 inches by 3 feet 5\r\n  inches; thickness, 1 foot 9 inches.\r\n\r\n  The other groups do not command remarkable prospects, but from this\r\n  last group there is a fine view of the sea, with the island of\r\n  Rathlin O'Beirne close below, and beyond the mountainous coast line\r\n  of Mayo as far as Belmullet.\r\n\r\n  So far the stone monuments of Glen Malin.\r\n\r\n  In Glen Columbkille is but one group. It stands in the townland of\r\n  Farn MacBride, on the north side of the glen, and at the foot of the\r\n  mountain Ballard. Its monuments are all of the chamber kind. The\r\n  chambers are made of huge slabs, one at each side, one atop, one at\r\n  each end. I measured one, and found the sides each 12 feet long and\r\n  4 feet broad. Most of the monuments project but little above the\r\n  ground. One is used to keep calves in, one for pigs, and one for\r\n  lambs. A native of the townland told me that his brother had dug up a\r\n  skull and a piece of earthenware near one of the cromlechs. The skull\r\n  was buried in the churchyard, and its grave is forgotten. The same\r\n  man also told me that, digging to clear a cromlech for a malt-store,\r\n  they found that the side slabs rested on a basement slab. The ground\r\n  is very rugged about these monuments, and some are quite beneath\r\n  ground, but I think there are altogether six.\r\n\r\n  I hope that, if these notes are too late to be of use for your book,\r\n  they may yet be of some interest to you, and\r\n\r\n  I remain, my dear Sir, yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n  NORMAN MOORE.\r\n\r\n  _James Fergusson, Esq._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn receiving the above communication, I forwarded to Mr. Moore an\r\nimpression of the woodcut No. 80, representing Calliagh Birra's Tomb or\r\nHouse, and received the following reply:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  DUNMINNING, GLARRYFORD, CO. ANTRIM,\r\n\r\n  _August 28, 1871_.\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,--The cromlechs of Farn MacBride, as they stand\r\n  apparently undisturbed, exactly resemble in plan that depicted in\r\n  the woodcut. With one or two exceptions the cromlechs of Glen Malin,\r\n  as far as one can tell in their fallen condition, are built on the\r\n  same plan. The shape of the stones at the sides and of the top slabs\r\n  of the cromlech in the engraving is exactly the shape of the stones\r\n  of the cromlechs in both Glen Malin and Farn MacBride. In one or\r\n  two of the cromlechs I noticed stones which might correspond to the\r\n  buttress-like outside stones of the ground-plan in the cut.\r\n\r\n  The number of slabs in the side walls of the Glen cromlechs is\r\n  smaller than the number in the woodcut.\r\n\r\n  The very large cromlech, easternmost of the group the first described\r\n  in my letter, is in every particular, except the number of its\r\n  component blocks, the counterpart of your engraving.\r\n\r\n  _In fine_, the plan of all the cromlechs of Glen Columbkille, except\r\n  one or two, the variety of which may be owing to disarrangement, is\r\n  that of the Meath cromlech.\r\n\r\n  NORMAN MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n   [Footnote 600: Throughout this paper Mr. Moore uses the term\r\n    \"Cromlech,\" as is usually done by English antiquaries, in the sense\r\n    in which \"Dolmen\" is employed in the body of the work.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\nTHE DIGGINGS IN ODEN'S HOWE, &c. Gamla, Upsala, 1846-7.\r\n\r\n\r\n  These diggings were conducted by Riks Antiquary B. E. Hildebrand and\r\n  Lieut.-Colonel Ståt, chiefly in the days of August-September, 1846,\r\n  and June 7-22, 1847. The only printed notices thereon appeared at the\r\n  time, chiefly from the pen of B. E. Hildebrand, in the Upsala paper\r\n  'Correspondenten,' Nos. 75, 77, 79--September 12, 19, 26, 1846, and\r\n  Nos. 50, 53--June 23 and July 3, 1847.\r\n\r\n  1. 'Correspondenten,' September 12, 1846.--Diggings going on, but\r\n  prove more laborious than had been expected.\r\n\r\n  2. 'Correspondenten,' September 19, 1846.--A boarded gallery 7\r\n  Swedish feet 5 inches high and 5 feet broad has been constructed from\r\n  the east side of the howe (Oden's Howe, the largest of the three\r\n  so-called King-howes), towards the centre. After penetrating 68 feet\r\n  (20 met.), a mighty wall of granite blocks was struck, probably a\r\n  grave-chamber. The gently rising gallery abuts on the lowest stones\r\n  of the chamber. During the diggings have been found unburnt animal\r\n  bones, bits of dark wood, charcoal, burnt bones, &c. Thus this was\r\n  evidently a sepulchral mound. The name _King-howes_ is evidently\r\n  correct. Diggings have also been made in the smaller cairns near by,\r\n  and although they have been opened before, burial-urns have been\r\n  found, burnt human bones, bones of animals and birds, bits of iron\r\n  and bronze, &c.\r\n\r\n  3. 'Correspondenten,' September 26, 1846.--The great wall has proved\r\n  to be the edge of a mighty chamber. Between 200 and 300 large granite\r\n  blocks have been taken out. Some of them have traces of tooling. The\r\n  gallery has been carried 16 Swedish feet through the stone mass,\r\n  which lies on hard packed clay, over a layer of fine sand, resting\r\n  on large stones above the natural soil. At the middle of the howe\r\n  the grave-chamber is 9 feet above the level of the soil, 18 feet\r\n  under the top of the howe. On the bed of clay under the great stones\r\n  have been found an iron clinker 3 inches long, remains of pine poles\r\n  partly burnt, a lock of hair chestnut coloured, &c. The numerous\r\n  clusters of charcoal show that the dead had been burned on the layer\r\n  of clay, and the bones have been collected in an urn not yet found.\r\n  In one of the nearest small howes have been found a quantity of\r\n  burnt animal and human bones, two little-injured bronze brooches, a\r\n  fragment of a golden ornament, &c.\r\n\r\n  4. 'Correspondenten,' June 23, 1847.--The burial-urn has been found\r\n  in the grave-chamber. Also have turned up bones of men, horses, dogs,\r\n  a golden ornament delicately worked, a bone comb, bone buttons, &c.\r\n\r\n  5. 'Correspondenten,' July 3, 1847.--The gallery has been driven 4\r\n  feet farther, thereafter has been made a side gallery, 8½ feet\r\n  wide and 8 feet long, up to the burial-urn. This was found 3 inches\r\n  under the soil, and was covered with a thin slab. It was 7 inches\r\n  high, 9 inches in diameter, filled with burnt bones, human and animal\r\n  (horse, dog, &c.), ashes, charcoal (of needle and leaf trees), nails,\r\n  copper ornaments, bone articles, a bird of bone, &c. In the mass of\r\n  charcoal about were found bones, broken ornaments, bits of two golden\r\n  bracteates, &c. Coins of King Oscar were then placed in the urn, and\r\n  everything restored as before.\r\n\r\n  Frey's Howe was opened, and showed the same results.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The gallery remained for some years, and was visited by thousands of\r\n  persons, but afterwards fell in, and the howe is now inaccessible.\r\n\r\n  CARL SÄVE.\r\n\r\n  UPSALA, _March 1, 1871_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the sheets containing the account of the Scottish monuments were\r\nprinted off, I have received from Sir Henry Dryden slips of two letters\r\nwhich he addressed to the editor of the _John o' Groat's Journal_,\r\ngiving an account of some explorations he had made in Caithness during\r\nthis autumn. One of these contains an account of certain chapels,\r\nbrochs, and circles he had examined. The first two classes do not\r\nconcern us here, and are therefore omitted; but the circles are of\r\ninterest as probably belonging to the same category as those in the\r\nOrkneys, and the description of them is consequently printed with the\r\nother letter, which gives an account of four alignments which are so\r\ngermane to our subject that Sir Henry's description is printed _in\r\nextenso_. The name of the first, \"The Battle Moss, Yarhouse,\" is of\r\nitself singularly suggestive, and I have little doubt that, if properly\r\ninquired into, the peasantry could tell what battle was fought there,\r\nand what, consequently,  these lines were erected to commemorate.\r\nTaken in conjunction with the horned cairns described by Mr.\r\nAnderson,[601] and the circles, it does not seem to me doubtful that\r\nthe whole of this Caithness group belongs to the tenth century. The\r\ncircles, and especially the horned cairns, are the exact counterparts\r\nof the fanciful forms of the Viking graves found at Hjortehammer\r\n(woodcut No. 118) and elsewhere in Scandinavia, which resemble them in\r\nmore respects than one, and the alignments are such as those at Ashdown\r\n(woodcut No. 28). Nor need we go far for the events they commemorate.\r\nBetween the years 970 and 996, A.D., two great battles, at\r\nleast, are recorded to have taken place in Caithness, between the sons\r\nof Thorfin, and between Liotr, the victor of the first fight, and the\r\nScots, who in vain attempted to avenge the death of Skiuli; and besides\r\nthese there may have been many subordinate frays. It is probable that\r\nboth brothers were buried in Caithness, and we are distinctly told\r\nthat Laudver, the last surviving son of Thorfin, was certainly buried\r\nthere.[602]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 232. Horned Cairn, Caithness.]\r\n\r\nThe fact of these alignments and horned cairns and semicircles being\r\nunlike what is found elsewhere in Scotland, separates this group from\r\nanything existing further south. Their similarity to the Viking graves\r\nof Scandinavia, avowedly of the tenth century, points to an age from\r\nwhich they cannot be distant; and when it is recollected that Caithness\r\nin the tenth century formed part of the Orcadian Jarldom, it does not\r\nseem that we have far to seek for an authentic explanation of all we\r\nfind in that remote corner of the isle.\r\n\r\nJ. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 601: 'Proceedings Soc. Ant. Scot.,' vii. 480 _et seqq._]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 602: 'Barry's History of Orkney,' pp. 125-129.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM SIR H. DRYDEN, BART.,\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\n_Editor of the 'John o' Groat's Journal.'_\r\n\r\n   LINES, BATTLE MOSS, YARHOUSE. LINES AND CIST,\r\n  GARRYWHIN. LINES, \"MANY STONES,\" CLYTH. LINES,\r\n  CAMSTER. CIRCLE(?) ACHANLOCH. CIRCLE, GUIDEBEST,\r\n  LATHERONWHEEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GROUPS OF LINES.\r\n\r\n  I am not aware of any similar groups in Great Britain, though no\r\n  doubt there are some, and have no books at hand to refer to any in\r\n  Denmark, Norway, or Sweden. The groups of lines in France (of far\r\n  larger stones and greater length than those in Caithness) have the\r\n  largest stones and widest intervals and the highest ground (the\r\n  heads) to the west or thereabouts, and the smallest stones and\r\n  narrowest intervals and lowest ground (the tails) to the east or\r\n  thereabouts. The Caithness groups differ entirely in principle. The\r\n  one at Yarhouse Loch runs north and south, does not radiate, and\r\n  is on nearly level ground; but the three others have the narrower\r\n  intervals and higher ground to the north (which end we may call the\r\n  head), and radiate towards the south and lower ground. The group\r\n  at Battlemoss, near Yarhouse, is on ground falling slightly to\r\n  north-west. It consists of eight lines placed north and south. The\r\n  width at the south end is forty-four feet. The lines are somewhat\r\n  irregular, and appear to radiate slightly towards the north, but this\r\n  is uncertain. One line extends 384 feet, and another one 170 feet,\r\n  but the remaining six now only extend 133 feet. The ground is covered\r\n  with peat and heather, and other stones may be hidden below the\r\n  surface. There is no cairn or other grave now visible in proximity to\r\n  the lines. The largest stones are about 2 feet 6 inches high, 2 feet\r\n  6 inches wide, and 1 foot 3 inches thick.\r\n\r\n  The group at Garrywhin consists of six lines. The whole width at the\r\n  head (north-east end) is 50 feet, and at the bottom 107 feet. The\r\n  central line bears N.N.E. or S.S.W. The length of this line is 200\r\n  feet. The fall is 20 feet to the S.S.W. At the head is a cist of\r\n  slabs 3 feet 6 inches by 2 feet 6 inches, and 2 feet 4 inches deep,\r\n  placed east and west. As this grave is on the highest point of the\r\n  knoll, and as the lines commence at it, it is fair to presume that\r\n  they are connected. In the cist were found ashes, pieces of pottery,\r\n  and flint chips, but no bones. As the cist is between the third and\r\n  fourth lines, it is fair to presume that there never were more than\r\n  six lines.\r\n\r\n  The group called \"Many Stones\" has the head on the top of a knoll,\r\n  from which the ground falls on all sides. The lines are on the south\r\n  slope, and are 22 in number. The width at the head or north end is\r\n  118 feet, and at the bottom is 188 feet. The length in the centre is\r\n  145 feet, but there is no proof that this was the original length,\r\n  and the presumption is the reverse. The average bearing is north\r\n  and south, and the fall 10 feet 3 inches. The largest stones now\r\n  remaining are about 3 feet high, 3 feet wide, and 1 foot 6 inches\r\n  thick. There are numerous blocks of stone lying about the head,\r\n  where, however, the rock is exposed, but the example of Garrywhin\r\n  makes it probable that a cairn once existed on this knoll. There are\r\n  no traces of any _sunk_ grave, but the cairn may have contained a\r\n  chamber above ground, like many in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n  The group at Camster is on the moor, on ground falling slightly\r\n  to the south-west. A considerable depth of peat overlies the rock\r\n  here, and many stones are below the surface. There are now six lines\r\n  ascertained. The length is 105 feet, width at the head or north end\r\n  30 feet, and at the tail or lower end 53 feet. The average bearing is\r\n  north and south. The stones are smaller than at the last mentioned\r\n  group. There is no cairn or other grave apparent close to these\r\n  lines, but in a direction due north, at 346 feet, is a chambered\r\n  cairn. No stones are now traceable between; but as there are gaps in\r\n  the lines themselves, this blank interval may once have had lines on\r\n  it to connect the cairn with the existing group. No habitation _now_\r\n  exists near the spot, but there were many in this strath, which may\r\n  account for destruction of stones in former times. A few hundred feet\r\n  farther north is the huge horned cairn described by Mr. Anderson, and\r\n  at 436 feet N.N.E. from the small cairn is the round chambered cairn\r\n  described in the same paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CIRCLE AT ACHANLOCH, ESTATE OF FORSE, IN PARISH OF LATHERON.\r\n\r\n  The name is spelt Achinloch and Auchinleck. These no doubt are wrong,\r\n  and probably the name is derived from Gaelic words signifying \"The\r\n  Field at the Loch,\" or \"The Field of the Stones,\" from these standing\r\n  stones. The place is close to the new road from Lybster to Thurso.\r\n  This series of standing-stones, entitled \"circle,\" as a classname,\r\n  is in the form of a donkey's shoe, the length being N.N.W, and\r\n  S.S.E., the open end to the latter. The sides are nearly parallel.\r\n  The area is covered with heather and peat, on a substratum of rock\r\n  of the slaty character common to the district. The ground falls from\r\n  the area to the west, north, and east. In the latter direction, the\r\n  ground falls only for a short distance, and then rises to much higher\r\n  ground. On the north-east, at 700 feet or 800 feet, is the loch of\r\n  Stemster.\r\n\r\n  There is no evidence that the two south ends were ever joined by a\r\n  straight or curved line of stones; and as the sides are of equal\r\n  length, we may infer that they never were joined, though possibly\r\n  intended to be so. The highest point of the area is about 13 feet\r\n  above the hollow on the east. This donkey-shoe-shaped series of stones\r\n  is 226 feet long, and 110 feet wide in the middle, inside measure. The\r\n  two extremities are 85 feet 3 inches apart.\r\n\r\n  There are now 36 stones existing, of which only one is down; but by\r\n  filling up intervals at usual distances, it appears there were 54\r\n  stones, supposing the lower end vacant as now. The average interval\r\n  seems to have been 8 feet. The highest stone is 5 feet 7 inches high\r\n  above ground; the widest 5 feet 4 inches; and the thickest 1 foot 7\r\n  inches.\r\n\r\n  All these stones are of a slaty character, and have their sides\r\n  parallel, so that in width (long sides) they are generally three\r\n  or four times their thickness (short sides). But the singular\r\n  characteristic of this series is that the stones are set with their\r\n  long sides at right angles to the curve, projecting like cogs of a\r\n  wheel.\r\n\r\n  In many circles some or all of the stones have no decided difference\r\n  in the measures of width and thickness; but in all cases, when I have\r\n  found a difference, the long sides are in the line of the curve.\r\n\r\n  Any notice of an arrangement similar to that at Achanloch would be a\r\n  favour.\r\n\r\n  There is no appearance of any part of the area having been disturbed\r\n  for burial or other purposes. There is a ruin of a chambered cairn\r\n  south-east of the circle; and in the loch of Rangag, about a mile\r\n  west, is the remain of a brough.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CIRCLE AT GUIDEBEST, LATHERONWHEEL, PARISH OF LATHERON.\r\n\r\n  The place is on the north bank of the burn, one mile and a half\r\n  up the strath. The circle is nearly true in form, and though now\r\n  imperfect, doubtless was once complete. It is 170 feet in diameter.\r\n  The area is flat, covered with heather and peat, on a substratum of\r\n  rock in some places, and of alluvial gravel in others. It is 15 feet\r\n  above the brook, which has washed away the cliff very close up to the\r\n  south-west stone, and appears likely, unless prevented, to dislocate\r\n  the stones on that side.\r\n\r\n  There are now only seven stones existing--all erect--and by filling\r\n  up the gaps at usual distances there were thirteen stones. The\r\n  average interval seems to have been 45 feet. The highest stone is\r\n  5 feet 3 inches above ground; the widest 3 feet 2 inches; and the\r\n  thickest 1 foot 10 inches. The stone is of the common argillaceous\r\n  slate of the district.\r\n\r\n  The stones are nearer square or circular in plan than those at\r\n  Achanloch, but (so far as they can be) are all set with the long\r\n  sides to the curve. The south stone is a little beyond the line of\r\n  the circle, but is evidently a moved and erected stone.\r\n\r\n  There are numbers of stones lying about the area; but no evidence of\r\n  a cairn or other burial-place in or near the circle. From its soil,\r\n  and the absence of remains, it was probably not sepulchral, though\r\n  some antiquaries hold that all circles are sepulchral.\r\n\r\n  Lower down the strath on the same side of the brook were many circles\r\n  which were destroyed in \"improving\" the land some years ago. These\r\n  are stated to have been 20 or 30 yards across, of stones 2 feet to\r\n  4 feet high. No remains are known to have been found in them; but\r\n  no observations or measures were made. It is probable that these\r\n  circles were sepulchral--the absence of stones in the centres\r\n  notwithstanding. Nearer the road and shore are other remains of\r\n  broughs, cairns, cists, &c.\r\n\r\n  I remain your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  H. DRYDEN,\r\n\r\n  Hon.
