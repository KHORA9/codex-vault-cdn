Nor is it a mere collection of dry facts and figures, set\r\nforth to show that the oil business is a pretty big enterprise. But it\r\n_is_ a sincere endeavor to print something regarding petroleum, based\r\nlargely upon personal observation, which may be worth saving from\r\noblivion. The purpose is to give the busy outside world, by anecdote and\r\nincident and brief narration, a glimpse of the grandest industry of the\r\nages and of the men chiefly responsible for its origin and growth. Many\r\nof the portraits and illustrations, nearly all of them now presented for\r\nthe first time, will be valuable mementoes of individuals and localities\r\nthat have passed from mortal sight forever. If the reader shall find\r\nthat “within is more of relish than of cost” the writer of these\r\n“Sketches” will be amply satisfied.\r\n\r\n                             SECOND EDITION\r\n\r\nThe first edition of five-thousand copies having been exhausted, the\r\nsecond is now issued. The oil-development is progressive, hence numerous\r\nillustrations and much new matter are added. Hearty thanks are returned\r\nhosts of friends and the public generally for kindly appreciation of the\r\nwork. Perhaps something not thanks may be due the lonely few who “care\r\nfor none of these things.” This will likely end the pleasant task of\r\nreviewing petroleum’s wide field and “living the old days over again,”\r\nso it is fitting to pray, with Tiny Tim, “God bless us every one.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“_No man likes mustard by itself._”—_BEN JONSON._\r\n\r\n“_He has carried every point who has mixed the useful with the\r\n    agreeable._”—_HORACE._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGES\r\n\r\n CHAPTER I.

Many\r\nintelligent persons, recalling the tallow-dip and lard-oil lamp of their\r\nyouth, consider the entire petroleum-business of very recent date,\r\nwhereas its history goes back to remotest antiquity. Naturally they are\r\ndisappointed to find it, in various aspects, “the same thing over\r\nagain.” Men and women in the prime of life have forgotten the flickering\r\npine-knot, the sputtering candle or the smoky sconce hardly long enough\r\nto associate rock-oil with “the brave days of old.” This idea of newness\r\nthe host of fresh industries created by oil-operations has tended to\r\ndeepen in the popular mind. Enjoying the brilliant glow of a modern\r\nargand-burner, double-wicked, silk-shaded, onyx-mounted and altogether a\r\ngenuine luxury, it seems hard to realize that the actual basis of this\r\nup-to-date elegance has existed from time immemorial. Of derricks,\r\ndrilling-tools, tank-cars, refineries and pipe-lines our ancestors were\r\nblissfully ignorant; but petroleum itself, the foundation of the\r\ncountless paraphernalia of the oil-trade of to-day, flourished “ere\r\nNoah’s flood had space to dry.” Although used to a limited extent in\r\ncrude-form for thousands of years, it was reserved for the present age\r\nto introduce the grand illuminant to the world generally. After sixty\r\ncenturies the game of “hide-and-seek” between Mother Earth and her\r\nchildren has terminated in favor of the latter. They have pierced\r\nnature’s internal laboratories, tapping the huge oil-tanks wherein the\r\nproducts of her quiet chemistry had accumulated “in bond,” and up came\r\nthe unctuous fluid in volumes ample to fill all the lamps the universe\r\ncould manufacture and to grease every axle on this revolving planet! The\r\ndemon of darkness has been exorcised from the gloomy caverns of old to\r\nmake room for the modern angel of light. Science, the rare alchemist\r\nwhich converts the tear of unpaid labor into a steam-giant that turns\r\nwith tireless arm the countless wheels of toil, lays bare the deepest\r\nrecesses of the past to bring forth treasures for the present.\r\n\r\nThe capital invested in petroleum in this country has increased from\r\none-thousand dollars, raised in 1859 to drill the first well in\r\nPennsylvania, to six-hundred-millions. It is just as easy to say\r\nsix-hundred-million dollars as six-hundred-million grains of sand, but\r\nthe possibilities of such a sum of money afford material for endless\r\nflights of the imagination. Thirty-thousand miles of pipe-lines handle\r\nthe output most expeditiously, conveying it to the seaboard at less than\r\nteamsters used to receive for hauling it a half-mile. Ten-thousand\r\ntank-cars have been engaged in its transportation. Seventy-five\r\nbulk-steamers and fleets of sailing-vessels carry refined from\r\nPhiladelphia and New York to the most distant ports in Europe, Africa\r\nand Asia. “Astral Oil” and “Standard White” have penetrated “wherever a\r\nwheel can roll or a camel’s foot be planted.” In Pennsylvania,\r\nSouth-eastern Ohio and West Virginia thirty-five-million barrels have\r\nbeen produced and eight-thousand wells drilled in a single year. Add to\r\nthis the results of operations in North-eastern Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming and California, and it must be\r\nacknowledged that petroleum is entitled to the chief seat in the\r\nsynagogue. Edward Bellamy may, perhaps, be imitated profitably and\r\npleasantly in this connection by “Looking-Backward.”\r\n\r\n                 Looking forward is the proper kink,\r\n                 Smooth as skating in an icy rink,\r\n                 In one’s planning how to fill a chink\r\n                     At manifold times and places;\r\n                 But for winning in a thoughtful think,\r\n                 Past and present joining with a link\r\n                 Guaranteed to wash and never shrink,\r\n                     Looking backward holds four aces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BAD BOY’S IDEA OF ADAM’S FALL.]\r\n\r\nPrecisely how, why, when, where and by whom petroleum was first\r\ndiscovered and utilized nobody living can, and nobody dead will, tell\r\nanxious inquirers. The information has “gone where the woodbine\r\ntwineth,” to join the dodo, the megatherium, the ichthyosaurus and the\r\n“lost arts” Wendell Phillips embalmed in fadeless prose. An erratic\r\nJoe-Millerite has traced the stuff to the Garden of Eden in a fashion\r\nakin to the chopping logic of the Deacon’s “Wonderful One-Horse Shay.”\r\nHear him:\r\n\r\n“Adam had a fall?”\r\n\r\n“Sure as death and taxes.”\r\n\r\n“Why did he fall with such neatness and dispatch?”\r\n\r\n“Maybe he took a spring to fall.”\r\n\r\n“Naw! Because everything was greased for the occasion! Unquestionably\r\nthe only lubricant on this footstool just then was the petroleum brewed\r\nin God’s own subterranean stills. Therefore, petroleum figured in Eden,\r\nwhich was to be demonstrated according to Hoyle. See?”\r\n\r\nThere is no “irrepressible conflict” between this reasoning, the version\r\nof the Pentateuch and the idea of Peck’s Bad Boy that “Adam clumb a\r\nappul-tree to put coal-oil onto it to kill the insecks, an’ he sawed a\r\nsnaik, an’ the oil made the tree slippy, an’ he fell bumpety-bump!” What\r\na heap of trouble would have been avoided if that pippin had been soaked\r\nin crude-oil, that Eve might turn up her nose at it and give the serpent\r\nthe marble heart! As Miss Haney expresses it:\r\n\r\n        “O Eve, little Eve, if you only had guess’d\r\n          Who it was that tempted you so,\r\n        You’d have kept out of mischief, nor lost your nice home\r\n          For the sake of an apple, I know.”\r\n\r\nOther wags attribute the longevity of antediluvian veterans to their\r\nunstinted use of petroleum for internal and external ailments! Had\r\nmedical almanacs, patent nostrums and circus-bill testimonials been\r\nevolved at that interesting period, the oleum-vender would have hit the\r\nbull’s-eye plump in the center. Guess at the value of recommendations\r\nlike these, with the latest accompaniment of “before-and-after” pictures\r\nin the newspapers:\r\n\r\nLAND OF NOD, _April 1, B.

Genesis affirms that “the vale of Siddim was full\r\nof slime-pits”—language too direct to be dismissed by hinting vaguely at\r\n“the mistakes of Moses.” Deuteronomy speaks of “oil out of the flinty\r\nrock” and Micah puts the pointed query: “Will the Lord be pleased with *\r\n* * ten thousands of rivers of oil?” To the three friends who condoled\r\nwith him in his grievous visitation of boils the patriarch of Uz\r\nasserted: “And the rock poured me out rivers of oil.” Whatever his\r\nhearers might think of this apparent stretch of fancy, Job’s forecast of\r\nthe oleaginous output was singularly felicitous. Evidently the\r\nOld-Testament writers, whose wise heads geology had not muddled, knew a\r\ngood deal about the petroleum situation in their day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Well, this beats the deuce!]\r\n\r\nA follower of Voltaire was accustomed to wind up his assaults on\r\ninspiration by criticising these oily quotations unmercifully. “Could\r\nanything be more absurd,” he would ask, “than to talk of ‘oil from a\r\nflinty rock’ and ‘rocks pouring forth rivers of oil?’ If anything were\r\nneeded to prove the Bible a fool-book from start to finish, such\r\nutterances would settle the matter beyond dispute. Rocks yielding rivers\r\nof oil cap the climax of ridiculous nonsense! Next they’ll want folks to\r\nbelieve that Jonah swallowed the whale, hair and hide and breeches.\r\nBah!”\r\n\r\nMonths and years passed away swiftly, as they have a habit of doing, and\r\nthe sturdy agnostic continued arguing pluckily. At length tidings of\r\noil-wells flowing thousands of barrels of crude reached him from William\r\nPenn’s broad heritage. He came, he saw and, unlike Julius Cæsar, he\r\nsurrendered unconditionally. Remarking, “This beats the deuce!” the\r\ndoubter doubted no more. He revised his opinions, humbly accepted the\r\ngospel and professed religion, openly and above-board. Hence the\r\npetroleum-development is entitled to the credit of one notable\r\nconversion, at least, and the balance is on the right side of the\r\nledger, assuming that a human soul outweighs the terrestrial globe in\r\nthe unerring scales of the Infinite.\r\n\r\n              Can they be wrong, who think the stingy soul\r\n              That grudges honest toil its scanty dole\r\n              Not worth its weight in slaty, sulphur coal?\r\n\r\nWhether petroleum, which literally signifies “rock-oil,” be of mineral,\r\nvegetable or animal origin matters little to the producer or consumer,\r\nwho views it from a commercial standpoint. In its natural state it is a\r\nvariable mixture of numerous liquid hydro-carbons, holding in solution\r\nparaffine and solid bitumen, or asphaltum. The fountains of Is, on the\r\nEuphrates, were familiar to the founders of Babylon, who secured\r\nindestructible mortar for the walls of the city by pouring melted\r\nasphaltum between the blocks of stone. These famous springs attracted\r\nthe attention of Alexander, Trajan and Julian. Even now asphaltum\r\nprocured from them is sold in the adjacent villages. The commodity is\r\nskimmed off the saline and sulphurous waters and solidified by\r\nevaporation. The ancient Egyptians used another form of the same\r\nsubstance in preparing mummies, probably obtaining their supplies from a\r\nspring on the Island of Zante, described by Herodotus. It was flowing in\r\nhis day, it is flowing to-day, and a citizen of Boston owns the\r\nproperty. Wells drilled near the Suez canal in 1885 found petroleum. So\r\nthe gay world jogs on. Mummified Pharaohs are burned as fuel to drive\r\nlocomotives over the Sahara, while the Zantean fount whose oil besmeared\r\n“the swathed and bandaged carcasses” is purchased by a Massachusetts\r\nbean-eater! Yet victims of “that tired feeling” turn to namby-pamby\r\nnovels of the Laura-Jean-Libby brand for real romance!\r\n\r\n             “For truth is strange, stranger than fiction.”\r\n\r\nAsphaltum is found in the Dead Sea, the supposed site of Sodom and\r\nGomorrah, and on the surface of a chain of springs along its banks, far\r\nbelow the level of the ocean. Strabo referred to this remarkable feature\r\ntwo thousand years ago. The destruction of the two ill-fated cities may\r\nhave been connected with, if not caused by, vast natural stores of this\r\ninflammable petroleum. The immense accumulations of hardened rock-oil in\r\nthe center and on the banks of the sea were oxidized into rosin-like\r\nasphalt. Pieces picked up from the waters are frequently carved, in the\r\nconvents of Jerusalem, into ornaments, which retain an oily flavor.\r\nAristotle, Josephus and Pliny mention similar deposits at Albania, on\r\nthe shores of the Adriatic. Dioscorides Pedanius, the Greek historian,\r\ntells how the citizens of Agrigentum, in Sicily, burned petroleum in\r\nrude lamps prior to the birth of Christ. For two centuries it lighted\r\nthe streets of Genoa and Parma, in northern Italy. Plutarch describes a\r\nlake of blazing petroleum near Ecbatana. Persian wells have produced oil\r\nliberally for ages, under the name of “naphtha,” the descendants of\r\nCyrus, Darius and Xerxes consuming the fluid for its light. The earliest\r\nrecords of China refer to petroleum and small quantities have been found\r\nin Thibet. An oil-fountain on one of the Ionian Islands has gushed\r\nsteadily for over twenty centuries, without once going on a strike or\r\ntaking a vacation. Austria and France likewise possess oil-springs of\r\nconsiderable importance. Thomas Shirley, in 1667, tested the contents of\r\na shallow pit in Lancashire, England, which burned readily. Rev. John\r\nClayton visited it and wrote in 1691:\r\n\r\n“I saw a ditch where the water burned like brandy. Country-folk boil\r\neggs and meat in it.”\r\n\r\nNear Bitche, a small fort perched on the top of a peak, at the entrance\r\nof one of the defiles of Lorraine, opening into the Vosges Mountains-a\r\nfort which was of great embarrassment to the Prussians in their last\r\nFrench campaign—and in the valley guarded by this fortress stand the\r\nchateau and village of Walsbroun, so named from a strange spring in the\r\nforest behind it. In the middle ages this fountain was famous.\r\nInscriptions, ancient coins and the relics of a Roman road attest that\r\nit had been celebrated even in earlier times. In the sixteenth century a\r\nbasin and bath for sick people existed. No record of its abandonment has\r\nbeen preserved. In the last century it was rediscovered by a medical\r\nantiquarian, who found the naphtha, or white petroleum, almost\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nNine years ago Adolph Schreiner died in a Vienna hospital, destitute and\r\nalone. Yet he was the only son of a man known in Galicia as “the\r\nPetroleum King” and founder of the great industry of oil-refining. The\r\nfather shared the lot of many inventors and benefactors, increasing the\r\nworld’s wealth untold millions and poverty-stricken himself in his last\r\ndays. Schreiner owned a piece of ground near Baryslaw from which he took\r\na black, tarry muck the peasants used to heal wounds and grease\r\ncart-axles. He kneaded a ball from the slime, stuck a wick into it and a\r\nred flame burned until the substance exhausted. This was _the first\r\npetroleum-lamp_! Later Schreiner heard of distillation, filled a kettle\r\nwith the black earth and placed it on the fire. The ooze boiled over and\r\nexploded, shivering the kettle and covering the zealous experimenter\r\nwith deep scars. He improved his apparatus, produced the petroleum of\r\ncommerce and sold bottles of the fluid to druggists in 1853. He drilled\r\nthe first Galician oil-well in 1856 and built a real refinery, which\r\nfire destroyed in 1866. He rebuilt the works on a larger scale and fire\r\nblotted them out, ruining the owner. Gray hairs and feebleness had come,\r\nhe ceased the struggle, drank to excess and died in misery. His son,\r\nfrom whom much was expected, failed as a merchant and peddled matches in\r\nVienna from house to house, just as the aged brother of Signor Blitz,\r\nthe world-famed conjuror, is doing in Harrisburg to-day. Dying at last\r\nin a public hospital, kindred nor friends followed the poor outcast to a\r\npauper’s grave. “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation of\r\nspirit.”\r\n\r\n                Life’s page holds each man’s autograph—\r\n                Each has his time to cry or laugh,\r\n                Each reaps his share of grain or chaff,\r\n                But all at last the dregs must quaff—\r\n                The tombstone holds their epitaph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OIL IN SUMATRA.]\r\n\r\nAround the volcanic isles of Cape Verde oil floats on the water and to\r\nthe south of Vesuvius rises through the Mediterranean, exactly as when\r\n“the morning stars sang together.” Hanover, in Germany, boasts the most\r\nnortherly of European “earth-oils.” The islands of the Ottoman\r\nArchipelago and Syria are richly endowed with the same product. Roumania\r\nis literally flowing with petroleum, which oozes from the Carpathians\r\nand pollutes the water-springs. Turkish domination has hindered the\r\ndevelopment of the Roumanian region. Southern Australia is blessed with\r\nbituminous shales, resembling those in Scotland, good for sixty gallons\r\nof petroleum to the ton. The New-Zealanders obtained a meager supply\r\nfrom the hill-sides, collecting carefully the droppings from the\r\ninterior rocks, and several test-wells have resulted satisfactorily. The\r\nunsophisticated Sumatrans, whose straw-huts and squeaky music rendered\r\nthe Javanese village at the Columbian Exposition a tip-top novelty,\r\nstick pipes in rocks and hills that trickle petroleum and let the liquid\r\ndrop upon their heads until their bodies are sleek and slippery as an\r\neel. Chauncey F. Lufkin, of Lima, Ohio, inventor of the “Disk Powers”\r\nthat make oil-wells almost pump themselves, says it is funnier than a\r\nthree-ringed circus to watch a group of half-clad girls and women,\r\ntwo-thirds of them carrying babies, taking turns at this operation. He\r\nhas traveled through the oil-fields of Sumatra, India and Russia and his\r\nkodak has reproduced many odd scenes for the delectation of his friends.\r\nTwo companies drilling in Java propose to find out all about its\r\noil-resources as quickly as the tools can reach the decisive spot.\r\nUltimately Java coffee may be tinged with an oily flavor that will\r\ntickle the palates of consumers and set them wondering how the new aroma\r\nescaped their notice so persistently. Verily, “no pent-up Utica\r\nconfines” petroleum within the narrow compass of a nation or a\r\ncontinent. With John Wesley it may exultingly exclaim: “The whole earth\r\nis my parish,” or echo the Shakespearean refrain: “The world’s mine\r\noyster.”\r\n\r\nJ. W. Stewart, of Clarion, has been in Africa drilling for oil. An\r\nEnglish syndicate is behind the enterprise and test-wells are to be\r\nbored in the goldfields on the southern coast. Stewart, who returned\r\nlately, says it is amusing to see the monkeys climb up a derrick and\r\nwatch the drillers at work. Just how amused they will be, if the\r\nEnglishmen strike a spouter that drenches the monkeys and the derrick,\r\neach must diagram for himself until the result of carrying the\r\npetroleum-war into Africa is decided. C. E. Seavill, since 1874\r\nmining-and-land agent at Kimberley, in the diamond-fields of South\r\nAfrica, has organized a company with seventy-five-thousand dollars\r\ncapital to operate at Ceres, eighty miles north of Cape Town. He has\r\nleased enormous tracts of land, which American experts pronounce likely\r\nto prove rich oil-territory, and the first well will be drilled at a\r\nspot selected by W. W. Van Ness, of New York, an authority on petroleum.\r\nMr. Seavill spent years endeavoring to educate the people up to the\r\nnotion that South Africa might be good for something besides gold and\r\nprecious stones. A series of gushers in the Ceres district, big enough\r\nto discount yellow nuggets and sparkling gems, should be the fitting\r\nreward of his enterprise. Perhaps Heber’s missionary-hymn may yet start\r\nlike this, when the Hottentots pose as oil-operators:\r\n\r\n                     From Java’s spicy mountains,\r\n                       From Afric’s golden strand,\r\n                     Come tales of oily fountains\r\n                       Roll’d up by the third sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OIL-WELLS IN INDIA.]\r\n\r\nThe Rangoon district of India long yielded four-hundred-thousand\r\nhogsheads annually, the Hindoos using the oil to heal diseases, to\r\npreserve timber and to cremate corpses. Birma has been supplied from\r\nthis source for an unknown period. The liquid, which is of a\r\ngreenish-brown color and resembles lubricating-oil in density, gathers\r\nin pits sunk twenty to ninety feet in beds of sandy clays, overlying\r\nslates and sandstones. Clumsy pots or buckets, operated by quaint\r\nwindlasses, hoist the oil slowly to the mouth of the pits, whence it is\r\noften carried across the country in leathern bags, borne on men’s\r\nshoulders, or in earthern jars, packed into carts drawn by oxen. Major\r\nMichael Symes, ambassador to the Court of Ava in 1765, published a\r\nnarrative of his sojourn, in which is this passage:\r\n\r\n“We rode until two o’clock, at which hour we reached Yaynangheomn, or\r\nPetroleum Creek. * * * The smell of the oil is extremely offensive. It\r\nwas nearly dark when we approached the pits. There seemed to be a great\r\nmany pits within a small compass. Walking to the nearest, we found the\r\naperture about four feet square and the sides lined, as far as we could\r\nsee down, with timber. The oil is drawn up in an iron-pot, fastened to a\r\nrope passed over a wooden cylinder, which revolves on an axis supported\r\nby two upright posts. When the pot is filled, two men take hold of the\r\nrope by the end and run down a declivity, which is cut in the ground, to\r\na distance equal to the depth of the well. When they reach the end of\r\nthe track the pot is raised to its proper elevation; the contents, water\r\nand oil together, are discharged into a cistern, and the water is\r\nafterward drawn through a hole in the bottom. * * * When a pit yielded\r\nas much as came up to the waist of a man, it was deemed tolerably\r\nproductive; if it reached his neck it was abundant, and that which\r\nreached no higher than his knee was accounted indifferent.”\r\n\r\nLabor-saving machinery has not forged to the front to any great degree\r\nin the oil-fields of the East Indies. For the Burmese trade flat-boats\r\nascend the Irrawaddy to Rainanghong, a town inhabited almost exclusively\r\nby the potters who make the earthen jars in which the oil is kept for\r\nthis peculiar traffic. The methods of saving and handling the greasy\r\nstaple have not changed one iota since John the Baptist wore his suit of\r\ncamel’s-hair and curry-combed the Sadducees in the Judean wilderness.\r\nProgress cuts no ice beneath the shadows of the Himalayas,\r\nnotwithstanding the missionary efforts of Xavier, Judson, Carey,\r\nMorrison and Duff.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP OF NATIVE OIL-OPERATORS IN INDIA DOWN FROM THE\r\nHILLS.]\r\n\r\nPetroleum in India occurs in middle or lower tertiary rock. In the\r\nRawalpindi district of the Panjab it is found at sixteen localities. At\r\nGunda a well yielded eleven gallons a day for six months, from a boring\r\neighty feet deep, and one two-hundred feet deep, at Makum, produced a\r\nhundred gallons an hour. The coast of Arakan and the adjacent islands\r\nhave long been famed for mud-volcanoes caused by the eruption of\r\nhydrocarbon gases. Forty-thousand gallons a year of petroleum have been\r\nexported by the natives from Kyoukpyu. The oil is light and pure. In\r\n1877 European enterprise was attracted to this industry and in 1879 work\r\nwas undertaken by the Borongo Oil-Co. The company started on a large\r\nscale and in 1883 had twenty-four wells in operation, ranging from\r\nfive-hundred to twelve-hundred feet in depth, one yielding for a few\r\nweeks one-thousand gallons daily. The total pumped from ten wells during\r\nthe year was a quarter-million gallons; and in 1884 the company had to\r\nsuspend payment. Large supplies of high-class petroleum might be\r\nobtained from this region, if suitable methods of working were employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOMEN IN JAPAN CARRYING OIL ON THEIR BACKS.]\r\n\r\nJapan also takes a position in the oleiferous procession allied to that\r\nof the yellow dog under the band-wagon. At the base of Fuji-Yama, a\r\nmountain of respectable altitude, the thrifty subjects of the Mikado\r\nmanage a cluster of oil-pits in the style practiced by their\r\nforefathers. The mirv holes, the creaking apparatus and the general\r\nsurroundings are second editions of the Rangoon exhibits. Yum-Yum’s\r\ncountrymen are clever students and they have much to learn concerning\r\npetroleum. Twenty-one years ago a Japanese nobleman inspected the\r\nPennsylvania oil-fields, sent thither to report to the government all\r\nabout the American system of operating the territory. His observations,\r\nembodied in an official statement, failed to amend the moss-grown\r\nprocesses of the Fuji-Yamans, who preferred to “fight it out on the old\r\nline if it took all summer.” Two others followed on a similar mission in\r\n1897. Fifty wells, from one thousand to eighteen hundred feet deep, are\r\nproducing in the Echigo province of Japan. The largest flowed\r\nfive-hundred barrels the first day, declining to eight or ten, the\r\ncustomary average. The sand is white and the oil is of two grades, one\r\namber of 38° gravity, the other much darker and of 310 gravity. The\r\nmethods of refining and transporting are of the rudest, women carrying\r\nthe crude from the wells on their backs as squaws in North America tote\r\ntheir papooses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. G. BAYNE.]\r\n\r\nIn 1874 S. G. Bayne, now president of the Seaboard Bank of New-York\r\nCity, visited these oriental regions. The hard fate of the benighted\r\nheathen moved him to briny tears. They had never heard or read of “the\r\nannealed steel coupling,” “the Palm link,” the tubing, casing, engines\r\nand boilers the distinguished tourist had planted in every nook and\r\ncorner of Oildom. With the spirit of a true philanthropist, Bayne\r\ndetermined to “set them on a higher plane.” His choicest Hindostanee\r\npersiflage was aired in detailing the advantages of the Pennsylvania\r\nplan of running the petroleum-machine. Tales of fortunes won on Oil\r\nCreek and the Allegheny River were garnished with scintillations of\r\nIrish wit that ought to have convulsed the listeners. Alas! the supine\r\nAsiatics were not built that way and the good seed fell upon barren\r\nsoil. The story and, despite the finest lacquer and veneer\r\nembellishments, the experience were repeated in Japan. What better could\r\nbe expected of pagans who wore skirts for full-dress, practiced\r\nhari-kari and knew not a syllable about Brian Boru? Their conduct was\r\nanother convincing evidence of “the stern Calvinistic doctrine” of total\r\ndepravity. The Japs voted to stay in their venerable rut and not monkey\r\nwith the Yankee buzz-saw. “And the band played on.”\r\n\r\nYears afterwards two cars of drilling-tools and well-machinery were\r\nshipped to Calcutta and a couple of complete rigs to Yeddo—“only this\r\nand nothing more.” The genial Bayne attempted to square the account by\r\nprinting his eastern adventures and sending marked copies of\r\ntranslations to the Indo-Japanese press. Doubtless the waste-basket\r\nreceived what the office-cat spared of this unusual consignment. Mr.\r\nBayne began his prosperous career as an oilman by striking a snug well\r\nin 1869, on Pine Creek, near Titusville. He has written a book on\r\nAstronomy which twinkles with gobs of astral science Copernicus,\r\nHerschell, Leverrier, Proctor or Maria Mitchell never dreamed of. His\r\nunique advertisements have spread his fame from the Atlantic to the\r\nPacific. Digest these random samples of originality worthy of John J.\r\nIngalls:\r\n\r\n“We never make kite-track records; our speed takes in the full circle.”\r\n\r\n“The graveyards of the enemy are the monuments of our success.”\r\n\r\n“We never speak of our goods without glancing at the bust of George\r\nWashington which squats on the top of our annealed steel safe; a\r\ntwenty-five cent plaster cast of George lends an atmosphere of veracity\r\nto a trade which in these days it sometimes needs.”\r\n\r\n“Abdul Azis, the late Sultan of Morocco, bought a cheap boiler to drill\r\na water-well. It bu’st and he is now Abdul Azwas.”\r\n\r\n“We will never be buried with the ‘unknown dead’—we advertise.”\r\n\r\n“Our patent coupling is the precipitated vapor of fermented progress.”\r\n\r\n“The intellectual and æsthetic are provided for in consanguinity to\r\ntheir taste.”\r\n\r\n“Our conversational soloists never descend to orthochromatic photography\r\nin their orphean flights; they hug the shore of plain Anglo-Saxon and\r\nscoop the doubting Thomas.”\r\n\r\n“It will never do to shake a man because the lambrequins begin to appear\r\non the bottom of his pants and he wears a ‘dickey’ with a sinker.”\r\n\r\n“The Forget-me-nots of to-day are frequently found the Has-beens of\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Credit is the flower that blooms in life’s buttonhole.”\r\n\r\n“Many a man who now gives dinner-parties in a Queen-Anne front would be\r\nnibbling his Frankfurter in a Mary-Ann back had we not given him a\r\nhelping hand at the right moment.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLASSIC GROUND OF PETROLEUM.]\r\n\r\nThe classic ground of Petroleum is the little peninsula of Okestra,\r\njutting into the Caspian Sea. Extraordinary indications of oil and gas\r\nextend over a strip of country twenty-five miles long by a half-mile\r\nwide, in porous sandstone. Springs of heavier petroleum flow from hills\r\nof volcanic rocks in the vicinity. Open wells, in which the oil settles\r\nas it oozes from the rocks, are dug sixteen to twenty feet deep. For\r\ncountless generations the simple natives dipped up the sticky fluid and\r\ncarried it great distances on their backs, to burn in its crude state,\r\nbesides sending a large amount yearly to the Shah’s dominions. It is a\r\nforbidding spot-rocky, desolate, without a stream or a sign of\r\nvegetation. The unfruitful soil is saturated with oil, which exudes from\r\nthe neighboring hills and sometimes filters into receptacles hewn in the\r\nrock at a prehistoric epoch. On gala days it was part of the program to\r\npour the oil into the Caspian and set it ablaze, until the sea and land\r\nand sky appeared one unbroken mass of vivid, lurid, roaring flame. The\r\n“pillar of fire” which guided the wandering Israelites by night could\r\nscarcely have presented a grander spectacle. The sight might well convey\r\nto awe-stricken beholders intensely realistic notions of the place of\r\npunishment Col. Ingersoll and Henry Ward Beecher have sought by tongue\r\nand pen to abolish. “Old Nick,” however, at last advices was still doing\r\na wholesale business at the old stand!\r\n\r\nNear Belegan, six miles from the chief village of the Baku district, the\r\ngrandest of these superb exhibitions was given in 1817. A column of\r\nflame, six-hundred yards in diameter, broke out naturally, hurling rocks\r\nfor days together and raising a mound nine-hundred feet high. The roar\r\nof steaming brine was terrific. Oil and gas rise wherever a hole is\r\nbored. The sides of the mountain are black with dark exudations, while a\r\nspring of white oil issues from the foot. A clay-pipe or hollow reed,\r\nsteeped in lime water and set upright in the floor of a dwelling, serves\r\nas a sufficient gas-pipe. No wonder such a land as Baku, where in the\r\nfissures of the earth and rock the naphtha-vapors flicker into flame,\r\nwhere a boiling lake is covered with flame devoid of sensible heat,\r\nwhere after the autumn showers the surrounding country seems wrapped in\r\nfire, where the October moon lights up with an azure tint the entire\r\nwest and Mount Paradise dons a robe of fiery red, where innumerable jets\r\nenvelope the plains on moonless nights, where all the phenomena of\r\ndistillation and combustion can be studied, should have aroused the\r\nreligious sentiment of oriental mystics. The adoring Parsee and the\r\ncold-blooded chemist might worship cheek-by-jowl. Amidst this devouring\r\nelement men live and love, are born and die, plant onions and raise\r\nsheep, as in more prosaic regions.\r\n\r\nAt the southern extremity of the peninsula oil and gas shot upward in a\r\nhuge pyramid of light. Here was “the eternal fire of Aaku,” burning\r\ntwo-thousand-years as when Zoroaster reverently beheld it and flame\r\nbecame the symbol of Deity to the entranced Parsees. Here the poor\r\nGheber gathered the fuel to feed the sacred fire which burned\r\nperpetually upon his altar. Hither devout pilgrims journeyed even from\r\nfar-off Cathay, to do homage and bear away a few drops of the precious\r\noil, before the wolf had suckled Romulus or Nebuchadnezzar had been\r\nturned out to pasture. The “Eternal Fire,” unquenched for twenty-five\r\ncenturies, the digging of wells that tapped its supply of fuel put out a\r\ngeneration ago. Modern greed, respecting neither ancient association nor\r\nreligious sentiment, drew too lavishly upon the bountiful stock that fed\r\nthroughout the ages the grandest flame in history. At Lourakhanel, not\r\nfar from Baku, is a temple built by the fire-worshipers. The sea in\r\nplaces has such quantities of gas that it can be lighted and burned on\r\nthe surface of the water until extinguished by a strong wind. Strange\r\ndestiny of petroleum, first and last, to be the panderer of\r\nidolatry—fire-worship in the olden time, mammon-worship in this era of\r\nthe “Almighty Dollar!”\r\n\r\nDevelopments from Baku to the region north of the Black Sea,\r\nseven-hundred miles westward, have revealed vast deposits of petroleum.\r\nHundreds of wells have been drilled, some flowing one-hundred-thousand\r\nbarrels a day! Nobel Brothers’ No. 50, which commenced to spout in 1886,\r\nkept a stream rising four-hundred feet into the air for seventeen\r\nmonths, yielding three million barrels. This would fill a ditch five\r\nfeet wide, six feet deep, and a hundred miles long. These monsters eject\r\ntons of sand daily, which piles up in high mounds. Stones weighing forty\r\npounds have been thrown out. The common way of obtaining the oil is to\r\nraise it by means of long metal-cylinders with trap-bottoms. Pumps are\r\nimpossible on account of the fine sand coming up with the oil. These\r\ncylinders, which will hold from one to four barrels, on being raised to\r\nthe surface are discharged into pipes or ditches. Each trip of the\r\nbucket or cylinder takes a minute-and-a-half and the well is worked day\r\nand night. The average daily yield of a Russian well is about\r\ntwo-hundred barrels.\r\n\r\nPipe-lines, refineries and railroads have been provided and the three\r\nbig companies operating the whole field consolidated in 1893. The\r\nRothschilds combined with the Nobels and a prohibitory tariff prevents\r\nthe importation of foreign oils. Tank-steamers ply the Caspian Sea and\r\nthe Volga, many of the railways use the crude-oil for fuel and the\r\nsupply is practically unlimited. The petroleum-products are carried in\r\nthese steamers to a point at the mouth of the Volga River called Davit\r\nFoot, about four-hundred miles north of Baku and ninety miles from\r\nAstrakhan, and transferred into barges. These are towed by small\r\ntug-boats to the various distributing points on the Volga, where tanks\r\nhave been constructed for railway-shipments. The chief distributing\r\npoint upon the Volga is Tsaritzin, but there is also tankage at Saratof,\r\nKazan, and Nijni-Novgorod. From these points it is distributed all over\r\nRussia in tank-cars. Some is exported to Germany and to Austria. Russian\r\nrefined may not be as good an illuminant as the American, but it is made\r\nto burn well enough for all purposes and emits no disagreeable odor.\r\nAfter taking from crude thirty per-cent. illuminating distillate, about\r\nfifteen per-cent. is taken from the residuum. It is called “solar oil”\r\nand the lubricating-oil distillate is next taken off. From this\r\ndistillate a very good lubricant is obtained, affected neither by\r\nintense heat nor cold. The lubricating oil is made in Baku, but great\r\nquantities of the distillate are shipped to England, France, Belgium and\r\nGermany and there purified.\r\n\r\nRussian competition was for years the chief danger that confronted\r\nAmerican producers. Three partial cargoes of petroleum were sent to the\r\nUnited States as an experiment, netting a snug profit. Heaven favors the\r\nhustler from Hustlerville, who hoes his own row and doesn’t squat on a\r\nstump expecting the cow will walk up to be milked, and American oilmen\r\nare not easily downed. They have perfected such improvements in\r\nhandling, transporting, refining and marketing their product that the\r\nmajor portion of Europe and Asia, outside of the czar’s dominions, is\r\ntheir customer. Nailing their colors to the mast and keeping their\r\npowder dry, the oil-interests of this glorious climate don’t propose to\r\nquit barking until the last dog is dead!\r\n\r\nThe early Persians and Tartars burned crude-oil for light in stoneware\r\njugs, with a spout on one side to hold the flax-wick, that answered the\r\npurpose of lamps. In 1851 a chemist of Polish Austria exhibited a small\r\nquantity of distilled petroleum at the World’s Fair in London. The\r\nAustrian Emperor rewarded this step towards refining crude-oil by making\r\nthe chemist a prince.\r\n\r\nAll these things prove conclusively that petroleum is a veritable\r\nantique, always known and prized by millions of people in Asia, Africa\r\nand Europe, and not a mushroom upstart. Indeed, its pedigree sizes up to\r\nthe most exacting Philadelphia requirement. Mineralogists think it was\r\nquietly distilling “underneath the ground” when the majestic fiat went\r\nforth: “Let there be light!” Happily “age does not wither nor custom\r\nstale the infinite variety” of its admirable qualities. Neither is it a\r\nhot-house exotic, adapted merely to a single clime or limited to one\r\nfavored section of any country. It is scattered widely throughout the\r\ntwo hemispheres, its range of usefulness is extending constantly and it\r\nis not put up in retail packages, that exhaust speedily. Alike in the\r\ntropics and the zones, beneath cloudless Italian skies and the bleak\r\nRussian firmament, amid the flowery vales of Cashmere and the\r\nsnow-crowned heights of the Caucasus, by the banks of the turbid Ganges\r\nand the shores of the limpid Danube, this priceless boon has ever\r\ncontributed to the comfort and convenience of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe Star in the East was crowding into line as the full orb of day.\r\n\r\n                           A PETROLEUM IDYL.\r\n\r\nA ragged street-Arab, taken to Sunday-school by a kind teacher, heard\r\nfor the first time the story of Christ’s boundless love and sufferings.\r\nBig tears coursed down his grimy cheeks, until he could no longer\r\nrestrain his feelings. Springing upon the seat, the excited urchin threw\r\nhis tattered cap to the ceiling and screamed “Hurrah for Jesus!” It was\r\nan honest, sincere, reverent tribute, which the Recording Angel must\r\nhave been delighted to note. In like manner, considering its wondrous\r\npast, its glowing present and its prospective future, men, women and\r\nchildren everywhere, while profoundly grateful to the Divine Benefactor\r\nfor the transcendent gift, may fittingly join in a universal “Hurrah for\r\nPetroleum!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WELL AT BAKU, RUSSIA, FLOWING 50,000 BARRELS\r\n  A DAY, THROUGH A 16-INCH PIPE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n               Don’t make the mistake that Petroleum,\r\n               Like the kodak, the bike, or linoleum,\r\n                   Is something decidedly new;\r\n               Whereas it was known in the Garden\r\n               When Eve, in fig-leaf Dolly Varden\r\n                   Gave Adam an apple to chew.\r\n               Nor deem it a human invention,\r\n               By reason of newspaper-mention\r\n               Just lately commanding attention,\r\n                   Because it is Nature’s own brew.\r\n\r\n               Repeatedly named in the Bible,\r\n               Let none its antiquity libel\r\n                   Or seek to explain it away.\r\n               It garnish’d Methuselah’s table,\r\n               Was used by the builders of Babel\r\n                   And pilgrims from distant Cathay;\r\n               When Pharaoh and Moses were chummy\r\n               It help’d preserve many a mummy,\r\n               Still dreadfully life-like and gummy,\r\n                   In Egypt’s stone-tombs from decay!\r\n\r\n               At Baku Jove’s thunderbolts fir’d it,\r\n               Devout Zoroaster admir’d it\r\n                   As Deity symbol’d in flame;\r\n               Parsees from the realms of Darius,\r\n               Unweariedly earnest and pious,\r\n                   Adoring and worshipping came.\r\n               It cur’d Noah’s Ham of trichina,\r\n               Greas’d babies and pig-tails in China,\r\n               Heal’d Arabs from far-off Medina—\r\n                   The blind and the halt and the lame!\r\n\r\n               Herodotus saw it at Zante,\r\n               It blazed in the visions of Dante\r\n                   And pyres of supine Hindostan;\r\n               The tropics and zones have rich fountains,\r\n               It bubbles ’mid snow cover’d mountains\r\n                   And flows in the pits of Japan.\r\n               Confin’d to no country or nation,\r\n               A blessing to God’s whole creation\r\n               For light, heat and prime lubrication,\r\n                   All hail to this grand gift to man!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLE OF THE FIRE-WORSHIPPERS AT LOURAKHANEL, NEAR\r\nBAKU.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BURNING OF OIL IN THE BOGADOFF SHIPPING-YARD, RUSSIA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF WELLS AT BAKANY, IN THE RUSSIAN OIL-FIELD.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n                         A GLIMMER IN THE WEST.\r\n\r\nNUMEROUS INDICATIONS OF OIL ON THIS CONTINENT—LAKE OF\r\n    ASPHALTUM—PETROLEUM SPRINGS IN NEW YORK AND PENNSYLVANIA—HOW HISTORY\r\n    IS MANUFACTURED—PIONEERS DIPPING AND UTILIZING THE PRECIOUS\r\n    FLUID—TOMBSTONE LITERATURE—PATHETIC EPISODE—SINGULAR STRIKE—GEOLOGY\r\n    TRIES TO EXPLAIN A KNOTTY POINT.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n“Thou who wouldst see where dawned the light at last must westward\r\n    go.”—_Edwin Arnold._\r\n\r\n“America is the Lord’s darling.”—_Dr. Talmage._\r\n\r\n“Thee, hid the bowering vales amidst, I call.”—_Euripides._\r\n\r\n“A Mercury is not to be carved out of every wood.”—_Latin Proverb._\r\n\r\n“Never no duck wasn’t hatched by a drake.”—_Hall Caine._\r\n\r\n“Near the Niagara is an oil-spring known to the Indians.”—_De la Roche\r\n    D’Allion, A.

It abounds in South America, in the West Indies, the United\r\nStates and Canada. The most extensive and phenomenal natural fountain of\r\npetroleum ever known is on the Island of Trinidad. Hot bitumen has\r\nfilled a basin four miles in circumference, three-quarters of a mile\r\nfrom the sea, estimated to contain the equivalent of ten-millions of\r\nbarrels of crude-oil. The liquid boils up continually, observing no\r\nholidays or Sundays, seething and foaming at the center of the lake,\r\ncooling and thickening as it recedes, and finally becoming solid\r\nasphaltum. The bubbling, hissing, steaming caldron emits a sulphurous\r\nodor, perceptible for ten or twelve miles and decidedly suggestive of\r\nthe orthodox Hades. Humboldt in 1799 reported his impressions of this\r\nspontaneous marvel, in producing which the puny hand of man had no\r\nshare. From it is derived the dark, tough, semi-elastic material, first\r\nutilized in Switzerland for this purpose, which paves the streets of\r\nscores of cities. Few stop to reflect, as they glide over the noiseless\r\nsurface on whirling bicycles or behind prancing steeds, that the smooth\r\nasphaltum pavements and the clear “water-white” in the piano-lamp have a\r\ncommon parentage. Yet bloomers and pantaloons, twin-creations of the\r\ntailor, or diamonds and coal, twin-links of carbon, are not related more\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\n                   “Even men and monkeys may be kin.”\r\n\r\nThe earliest printed reference to petroleum in America is by Joseph de\r\nla Roche D’Allion, a Franciscan missionary who crossed the Niagara river\r\nfrom Canada in 1629 and wrote of oil, in what is now New York, known to\r\nthe Indians and by them given a name signifying “plenty there.” Likely\r\nthis was the petroleum occupying cavities in fossils at Black Rock,\r\nbelow Buffalo, in sufficient abundance to be an object of commerce.\r\nConcerning the celebrated oil-spring of the Seneca Indians near Cuba, N.\r\nY., which D’Allion may also have seen, Prof. Benjamin Silliman in 1833\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“This is situated in the western part of the county of Alleghany, in the\r\nstate of New York. This county is the third from Lake Erie on the south\r\nline of the state, the counties of Cattaraugus and Chautauqua lying west\r\nand forming the southwestern termination of the state of New York. The\r\nspring is very near the line which divides Alleghany and Cattaraugus. *\r\n* * The country is rather mountainous, but the road running between the\r\nridges is very good and leads through a cultivated region rich in soil\r\nand picturesque in scenery. Its geographical formation is the same as\r\nthat which is known to prevail in the western region; a silicious\r\nsandstone with shale, and in some places limestone, is the immediate\r\nbasis of the country. * * * The oil-spring or fountain rises in the\r\nmidst of a marshy ground. It is a muddy, dirty pool of about eighteen\r\nfeet in diameter and is nearly circular in form. There is no outlet\r\nabove ground, no stream flowing from it, and it is, of course, a\r\nstagnant water, with no other circulation than than which springs from\r\nthe changes in temperature and from the gas and petroleum that are\r\nconstantly rising through the pool.\r\n\r\n“We are told that the odor of petroleum is perceived at a distance in\r\napproaching the spring. This may be true in particular states of the\r\nwind, but we did not distinguish any peculiar smell until we arrived on\r\nthe edge of the fountain. Here its peculiar character became very\r\nobvious. The water is covered with a thin layer of petroleum or mineral\r\noil, as if coated with dirty molasses, having a yellowish-brown color.\r\n\r\n“They collect the petroleum by skimming it like cream from a milk-pan.\r\nFor this purpose they use a broad, flat board, made thin at one edge\r\nlike a knife; it is moved flat upon and just under the surface of the\r\nwater and is soon covered by a coating of petroleum, which is so thick\r\nand adhesive that it does not fall off, but is removed by scraping the\r\ninstrument upon the lip of a cup. It has then a very foul appearance,\r\nbut it is purified by heating and straining it while hot through\r\nflannel. It is used by the people of the vicinity for sprains and\r\nrheumatism and for sores on their horses.”\r\n\r\nThe “muddy, dirty pool” was included in an Indian reservation, one mile\r\nsquare, leased in 1860 by Allen, Bradley & Co., who drove a pipe into\r\nthe bog. At thirty feet oil began to spout to the tune of\r\na-barrel-an-hour, a rhythm not unpleasing to the owners of the venture.\r\nThe flow continued several weeks and then “stopped short, never to go\r\nagain.” Other wells followed to a greater depth, none of them proving\r\nsufficiently large to give the field an orchestra-chair in the\r\npetroleum-arena.\r\n\r\nIt is told of a jolly Cuban, wearing a skull innocent of garbage as\r\nUncle Ned’s, who “had no wool on the top of his head in the place where\r\nthe wool ought to grow,” that he applied oil from the “dirty pool” to an\r\nugly swelling on the apex of his bare cranium. The treatment lasted a\r\nmonth, by which time a crop of brand-new hair had begun to sprout. The\r\nwelcome growth meant business and eventually thatched the roof of the\r\nhappy subject with a luxuriant vegetation that would have turned\r\nPaderewski, Absalom, or the most ambitious foot-ball kicker green with\r\nenvy! Tittlebat Titmouse, over whose excruciating experiences with the\r\n“Cyanochaitanthropopoion” that dyed his locks a bright emerald readers\r\nof “Ten-Thousand a Year” have laughed consumedly, was “not in it”\r\ncompared with the transformed denizen of the pretty village nestling\r\namid the hills of the Empire State. Those inclined to pronounce this a\r\nbald-headed fabrication may see for themselves the precise spot the\r\nmud-hole furnishing the oil occupied prior to the advent of the prosaic,\r\nunsentimental driving-pipe.\r\n\r\nCaptain de Joncaire, a French officer in colonial days, who had charge\r\nof military operations on the Upper Ohio and its tributaries in 1721,\r\nreported “a fountain at the head of a branch of the Ohio, the water of\r\nwhich is like oil.” Undoubtedly this was the same “fountain” referred to\r\nin the _Massachusetts Magazine_ for July, 1791, as follows:\r\n\r\n“In the northern part of Pennsylvania is a creek called Oil Creek, which\r\nempties into the Allegheny river. It issues from a spring on which\r\nfloats an oil similar to that called Barbadoes tar, and from which one\r\nmay gather several gallons a day. The troops sent to guard the western\r\nposts halted at this spring, collected some of the oil and bathed their\r\njoints with it. This gave them great relief from the rheumatism, with\r\nwhich they were afflicted.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OIL-SPRING ON OIL CREEK.]\r\n\r\nThe history of petroleum in America commences with the use the pioneer\r\nsettlers found the red-men made of it for medicine and for painting\r\ntheir dusky bodies. The settlers adopted its medicinal use and retained\r\nfor various affluents of the Allegheny the Indian name of Oil Creek.\r\nBoth natives and whites collected the oil by spreading blankets on the\r\nmarshy pools along the edges of the bottom-lands at the foot of steep\r\nhill-sides or of mountain-walls that hem in the valleys supporting\r\ncoal-measures above. The remains of ancient pits on Oil Creek-the Oil\r\nCreek ordained to become a household word—lined with timbers and\r\nprovided with notched logs for ladders, show how for generations the\r\naborigines had valued and stored the product. Some of these queer\r\nreservoirs, choked with leaves and dirt accumulated during hundreds of\r\nyears, bore trees two centuries old. Many of them, circular, square,\r\noblong and oval, sunk in the earth fifteen to twenty feet and strongly\r\ncribbed, have been excavated. Their number and systematic arrangement\r\nattest that petroleum was saved in liberal quantities by a race\r\npossessing in some degree the elements of civilization. The oil has\r\npreserved the timbers from the ravages of decay, “to point a moral or\r\nadorn a tale,” and they are as sound to-day as when cut down by hands\r\nthat crumbled into dust ages ago.\r\n\r\nScientists worry and perspire over “the mound-builders” and talk glibly\r\nabout “a superior race anterior to the Indians,” while ignoring the\r\nrelics of a tribe smart enough to construct enduring storehouses for\r\npetroleum. People who did such work and filled such receptacles with oil\r\nwere not slouches who would sell their souls for whiskey and their\r\nforest-heritage for a string of glass-beads. Did they penetrate the rock\r\nfor their supply of oil, or skim it drop by drop from the waters of the\r\nstream? Who were they, whence came they and whither have they vanished?\r\nSurely these are conundrums to tax the ingenuity of imaginative solvers\r\nof perplexing riddles. Shall Macaulay’s New-Zealand voyager, after\r\nviewing the ruins of London and flying across the Atlantic, gaze upon\r\nthe deserted oil-wells of Venango county a thousand years hence and\r\nwonder what strange creatures, in the dim and musty past, could have\r\nbored post-holes so deep and so promiscuously? Rip Van Winkle was right\r\nin his plaintive wail: “How soon are we forgotten!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST OIL “SHIPPED” TO PITTSBURG.]\r\n\r\nThe renowned “spring” which may have supplied these remarkable vats was\r\nlocated in the middle of Oil Creek, on the McClintock farm, three miles\r\nabove Oil City and a short distance below Rouseville. Oil would escape\r\nfrom the rocks and gravel beneath the creek, appearing like air-bubbles\r\nuntil it reached the surface and spread a thin film reflecting all the\r\ncolors of the rainbow. From shallow holes, dug and walled sometimes in\r\nthe bed of the stream, the oil was skimmed and husbanded jealously. The\r\ndemand was limited and the enterprise to meet it was correspondingly\r\nmodest. Nathanael Cary, the first tailor in Franklin and owner of the\r\ntract adjoining the McClintock, peddled it about the townships early in\r\nthe century, when the population was sparse and every good housewife\r\nlaid by a bottle of “Seneca Oil” in case of accident or sickness. Cary\r\nwould sling two jars or kegs across a faithful horse, belonging to the\r\nclass of Don Quixote’s “Rosinante” and too sedate to scare at anything\r\nshort of a knickerbockered feminine astride a rubber-tired wheel.\r\nMounting this willing steed, which transported him steadily as “Jess”\r\ncarried the self-denying physician of “Beside the Bonnie Brier-Bush.”\r\nthe tailor-peddler went his rounds at irregular intervals. Occasionally\r\nhe took a ten-gallon cargo to Pittsburg, riding with it eighty miles on\r\nhorseback and trading the oil for cloth and groceries. His memory should\r\nbe cherished as the first “shipper” of petroleum to “the Smoky City,”\r\nthen a mere cluster of log and frame buildings in a patch of cleared\r\nground surrounding Fort Pitt. “Things are different now.”\r\n\r\nThe Augusts, a family living in Cherrytree township and remembered only\r\nby a handful of old residents, followed Cary’s example. Their stock was\r\nprocured from springs farther up Oil Creek, especially one near\r\nTitusville, which achieved immortality as the real source of the\r\npetroleum-development that has astounded the civilized world. They sold\r\nthe oil for “a quarter-dollar a gill” to the inhabitants of neighboring\r\ntownships. The consumption was extremely moderate, a pint usually\r\nsufficing a household for a twelvemonth. Nature’s own remedy, it was\r\nabsolutely pure and unadulterated, a panacea for “the thousand natural\r\nshocks that flesh is heir to,” and positively refused to mix with water.\r\nIf milk and water were equally unsocial, would not many a dispenser of\r\nthe lacteal fluid train with Othello and “find his occupation gone?”\r\nDon’t “read the answer in the stars;” let the overworked pumps in\r\nthousands of barnyards reply!\r\n\r\nNo latter-day work on petroleum, no book, pamphlet, sketch or magazine\r\narticle of any pretensions has failed to reproduce part of a letter\r\npurporting to have been sent in 1750 to General Montcalm, the French\r\ncommander who perished at Quebec nine years later, by the commander of\r\nFort Du Quesne, now Pittsburg. A sherry-cobbler minus the sherry would\r\nhave been pronounced less insipid than any oil-publication omitting the\r\nfavorite extract. It has been quoted as throwing light upon the\r\nreligious character of the Indians and offered as evidence of their\r\naffinity with the fire-worshippers of the orient! Official reports\r\nprinted and endorsed it, ministers embodied it in missionary sermons and\r\nit posed as infallible history. This is the paragraph:\r\n\r\n“I would desire to assure you that this is a most delightful land. Some\r\nof the most astonishing natural wonders have been discovered by our\r\npeople. While descending the Allegheny, fifteen leagues below the mouth\r\nof the Conewango and three above the Venango, we were invited by the\r\nchief of the Senecas to attend a religious ceremony of his tribe. We\r\nlanded and drew up our canoes on a point where a small stream entered\r\nthe river. The tribe appeared unusually solemn. We marched up the stream\r\nabout half-a-league, where the company, a band, it appeared, had arrived\r\nsome days before us. Gigantic hills begirt us on every side. The scene\r\nwas really sublime. The great chief then recited the conquests and\r\nheroism of their ancestors. The surface of the stream was covered with a\r\nthick scum, which, upon applying a torch at a given signal, burst into a\r\ncomplete conflagration. At the sight of the flames the Indians gave\r\nforth the triumphant shout that made the hills and valleys re-echo\r\nagain. Here, then, is revived the ancient fire-worship of the East;\r\nhere, then, are the Children of the Sun.”\r\n\r\nThe style of this popular composition, in its adaptation to the occasion\r\nand circumstances, rivals Chatterton’s unsurpassed imitations of the\r\nantique. Montcalm was a gallant soldier who lost his life fighting the\r\nEnglish under General Wolfe, the hero whose noble eulogy of the poet\r\nGray—“I would rather be the author of the ‘Elegy Written in a Country\r\nChurchyard’ than the captor of Quebec”—should alone crown him with\r\nunfading laurels. The commander of Fort Du Quesne also “lived and moved\r\nand had a being.” The Allegheny River meanders as of yore, the Conewango\r\nempties into it at Warren, the “Venango” is the French Creek which joins\r\nthe Allegheny at Franklin. The “small stream” up which they marched\r\n“about half-a-league” was Oil Creek and the destination was the\r\noil-spring of Joncaire and “Nat” Cary. The “gigantic hills” have not\r\ndeparted, although the “thick scum” is stored in iron tanks. But neither\r\nof the French commanders ever wrote or read or heard of the much-quoted\r\ncorrespondence, for the excellent reason that it had not been evolved\r\nduring their sojourn on this mundane sphere!\r\n\r\nFranklin, justly dubbed “The Nursery of Great Men,” gave birth to the\r\npretty story. Sixty-six years ago a bright young man was admitted to the\r\nbar and opened a law-office in the attractive hamlet at the junction of\r\nthe Allegheny River and French Creek. He soon ranked high in his\r\nprofession and in 1839 was appointed judge of a special district-court,\r\ncreated to dispose of accumulated business in Venango, Crawford, Erie\r\nand Mercer counties. The same year a talented divinity-student was\r\ncalled to the pastorate of the Presbyterian church in Franklin. The\r\nyouthful minister and the new judge became warm friends and cultivated\r\ntheir rare literary tastes by writing for the village-paper, a\r\nsix-column weekly. Among others they prepared a series of fictitious\r\narticles, based upon the early settlement of Northwestern Pennsylvania,\r\ndesigned to whet the public appetite for historic and legendary lore. In\r\none of these sketches the alleged letter to Montcalm was included.\r\nAverage readers supposed the minute descriptions and bold narratives\r\nwere rock-ribbed facts, an opinion the authors did not care to\r\ncontrovert, and at length the “French commander’s letter” began to be\r\nreprinted as actual, bona-fide, name-blown-in-the-bottle history!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. NATHANIEL R. SNOWDEN.]\r\n\r\nOne of the two writers who coined this interesting “fake” was Hon. James\r\nThompson, the eminent jurist, who learned printing in Butler, practiced\r\nlaw in Venango county, served three terms—the last as speaker—in the\r\nLegislature and one in Congress, was district-judge six years and sat on\r\nthe Supreme bench fifteen years, five of them as chief-justice of this\r\nstate. Judge Thompson removed to Erie in 1842 and finally to\r\nPhiladelphia. He married a daughter of Rev. Nathaniel R. Snowden, first\r\npastor of the First Presbyterian church in Harrisburg, in 1794-1803, and\r\nafterwards master of a noted academy at Franklin. Mr. Snowden’s wife was\r\nthe daughter of Dr. Gustine, a survivor of the frightful Wyoming\r\nmassacre. Their son, an eminent Franklin physician of early times, was\r\nthe father of the late Dr. S. Gustine Snowden and of Major-General\r\nGeorge R. Snowden, of Philadelphia, commander of the National-Guard of\r\nPennsylvania. The good minister died in Armstrong county, descending to\r\nthe grave as a shock of wheat fully ripe for the harvest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COL. ALEXANDER MCDOWELL.]\r\n\r\n                      ——“What is death\r\n              To him that meets it with an upright heart?\r\n              A quiet haven, where his shatter’d bark\r\n              Harbors secure till the rough storm is past,\r\n              After a passage overhung with clouds.”\r\n\r\nJudge Thompson’s literary co-worker was the Rev. Cyrus Dickson, D. D.,\r\nwho resigned his first charge in 1848, settled in the east and gained\r\ndistinction in the pulpit and as a forcible writer. How thoroughly these\r\nkindred spirits, now happily reunited “beyond the smiling and the\r\nweeping,” must have enjoyed the overwhelming success of their ingenious\r\nplot and laughed at the easy credulity which accepted every line of\r\ntheir contributions as gospel-truth! They could not fail to relish the\r\nefforts, prompted mainly by their fanciful scene on Oil Creek, to\r\nidentify as Children of the Sun the savage braves in buckskin and\r\nmoccasins whose noblest conception of heaven was an eternal surfeit of\r\ndog-sausage!\r\n\r\n               The Indian may be superstitious,\r\n               His tastes may be wholly pernicious;\r\n               But he bitterly spurns—can we blame him?—\r\n               The cranks who are ready to claim him\r\n               And with a white pedigree shame him.\r\n\r\nSigns of petroleum in the Keystone State were not confined to Oil-Creek.\r\nTen miles westward, in water-wells and in the bed and near the mouth of\r\nFrench Creek, the indications were numerous and unmistakable. The first\r\nwhite man to turn them to account was Marcus Hulings, of Franklin, the\r\noriginal Charon of Venango county. Each summer he would skim a quart or\r\ntwo of “earth-oil” from a tiny pond, formed by damming a bit of the\r\ncreek, the fluid serving as a liniment and medicine. This was the small\r\nbeginning of one whose relative and namesake, two generations later, was\r\nto rank as a leading oil-millionaire. Hulings “ferried” passengers\r\nacross the unbridged stream in a bark-canoe and plied a keel-boat to\r\nPittsburg, the round-trip frequently requiring four weeks. Passengers\r\nwere “few and far between,” consequently a book-keeper and a treasurer\r\nwere not engaged to take care of the receipts. The proprietor of the\r\ncanoe-ferry cleared a number of acres, raised corn and potatoes and\r\nlived in a log-cabin, not far from the site of the brush-factory, which\r\nstood for fifty years after his death. Probably he was buried in the\r\nnorth-west corner of the old graveyard, beside his wife and son, of whom\r\ntwo sunken headstones record:\r\n\r\n                                   In\r\n                               memory of\r\n                          Michael Hulings who\r\n                      departed this life: the 9th\r\n                         of August, 1797.

He hemmed in a pool on\r\nthe edge of French Creek, soaked up the greasy scum with a piece of\r\nflannel, wrung out the cloth and filled several bottles with\r\ndark-looking oil. The masons would swallow doses of it, rub it on their\r\nbruised hands and declare it a sovereign internal and external remedy.\r\nIn early manhood Mr. Whitman settled in Canal township, eleven miles\r\nnorthwest of Franklin, cultivated a farm and reared a large family. It\r\nwas the dream of his old age to see oil taken from his own land. In 1866\r\ntwo wells were drilled on the Williams tract, across the road from\r\nWhitman’s, with encouraging prospects. Depressed prices retarded\r\noperations and these wells remained idle. Four years later my uncle,\r\nGeorge Buchanan, and myself drilled on the Whitman farm. The patriarch\r\nwatched the progress of the work with feverish interest, spending hours\r\ndaily about the rig. A string of driving-pipe, up to that time said to\r\nbe the longest—153 feet—ever needed in an oil-well, had to be forced\r\ndown. Three feet farther a vein of sparkling water, tinged with sulphur,\r\nspouted above the pipe and it has flowed uninterruptedly since. The\r\nheavy tools pierced the rock rapidly and the delight of the “Doctor” was\r\nunbounded. He felt confident a paying well would result and waited\r\nimpatiently for the decisive test. A boy longing for Christmas or his\r\nfirst pair of boots could not be more keenly expectant. His fondest wish\r\nwas not to be gratified. He took sick and died, after a very short\r\nillness, in 1870, four days before the well was through the sand and\r\npumping at the rate of fifty barrels per diem!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE BUCHANAN.]\r\n\r\nThis singular well merits a brief notice. From the first sand, not a\r\ntrace of which was met in the two wells on the other side of the road,\r\noil and gas arose through the water so freely that drilling was stopped\r\nand tubing inserted. In twenty-four hours the well yielded fifty-eight\r\nbarrels of the blackest lubricant in America, 28° gravity, the hue of a\r\nstack of ebony cats and with plenty of gas to illuminate the\r\nneighborhood. Subsiding quickly, the tubing was drawn and the hole\r\ndrilled in quest of the third sand, the rock which furnished the lighter\r\npetroleum on Oil Creek. Eight feet were found seven-hundred feet towards\r\nthe antipodes, a torpedo was exploded, the tubing was put back and the\r\nwell produced two barrels a day for a year, divided between the sands\r\nabout equally, the green and black oils coming out of the pipe\r\nside-by-side and positively declining to merge into one. Other wells\r\nwere drilled years afterwards close by, without finding the jugular. Mr.\r\nWhitman sleeps in the Baptist churchyard near Hannaville, the sleep that\r\nshall have no awakening until the Judgment Day. Mr. Buchanan, who\r\noperated at Rouseville, Scrubgrass, Franklin and Bradford, left the\r\noil-regions nine years ago for the Black Hills and died in South Dakota\r\non March twenty-eighth, 1897. He was a man of sterling attributes, nobly\r\nconsiderate and unselfish. No truer, braver heart e’er beat in human\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n            “Yes, we must follow soon, will glad obey\r\n            When a few suns have rolled their cares away;\r\n            Tired with vain life, will close the weary eye—\r\n            ’Tis the great birthright of mankind to die.”\r\n\r\nExcavating for the Franklin canal in 1832, on the north bank of French\r\nCreek, opposite “the infant industry” of Hulings forty years previously,\r\nthe workmen were annoyed by a persistent seepage of petroleum,\r\nexecrating it as a nuisance. A well dug on the flats ten years later,\r\nfor water, encountered such a glut of oil that the disgusted wielder of\r\nthe spade threw up his job and threw his besmeared clothes into the\r\ncreek! When the oil-excitement invaded the county-seat the greasy well\r\nwas drilled to the customary depth and proved hopelessly dry! At\r\nSlippery Rock, in Beaver county, oil exuded abundantly from the sandy\r\nbanks and bed of the creek, failing to pan out when wells were put down.\r\nSomething of the same sort occurred in portions of Lawrence county and\r\non the banks of many streams in different sections of the country. A\r\ngeological expert endeavors to make it as clear as mud in this manner:\r\n\r\n“‘Surface shows’ have been the fascination of many. The places of most\r\ncopious escape to the surface were regarded as the favored spots where\r\n‘the drainage from the coal measures, in defiance of the laws of gravity\r\nand hydro-dynamics, had obligingly deposited itself. Such shows’ were\r\nalways illusory. A great ‘surface show’ is a great waste; where nature\r\nplays the spendthrift she retains little treasure in her coffers. The\r\nproduction of petroleum in quantities of economical importance has\r\nalways been from reservoirs in which nature has been hoarding it up,\r\ninstead of making a superficial and deceptive display of her wealth.”\r\n\r\nApplying this method, the place to find petroleum is where not a symptom\r\nof it is visible! An honest Hibernian, asked his opinion of a notorious\r\nfalsifier, answered that “he must be chock-full ov truth, fur bedad he\r\nniver lets any ov it git out!” The above explanation is of this stripe.\r\n“Flee to the mountains of Hepsidam” rather than attempt to bore for oil\r\nin localities having “shows” of the very thing you are after! These\r\ndreadfully deceptive “shows” show that the oil has got out and emptied\r\nthe “reservoirs in which nature had been hoarding it up!” This is a\r\npretty rough joke on poor deluded nature! How could these “surface\r\nshows” have strayed off anyhow, unless connected with reservoirs of\r\ngenuine petroleum at the outset? The first wells on Oil Creek and at\r\nFranklin were drilled beside “surface shows” which revealed the\r\nexistence of petroleum and supplied Cary, August, McClintock and Hulings\r\nwith the coveted oil. These wells produced petroleum “in quantities of\r\neconomical importance,” demonstrating that “such shows were _not_ always\r\nillusory.” Is nature buncoing petroleum-seekers by hanging out a\r\nWill-o’-the-Wisp signal where there is “little treasure in her coffers?”\r\nThe failures at Slippery Rock and divers other places resulted from the\r\nfact that the seepages had traveled considerable distances to find\r\nbreaks in the rocks that would permit of the “most copious escape.”\r\n\r\nCentral and South America are fairly stocked with petroleum-indications.\r\nIn the early days of the Panama Railroad and during the construction of\r\nthe ill-fated canal numerous efforts were made to explore the\r\ncoal-regions of the Atlantic, in proximity to the ports of Colon and\r\nPanama. These researches led to the discovery of bituminous shales and\r\nlignite near the port of Boca del Toro, on the Caribbean Sea. The map of\r\nColombia shows a great indenture on the Atlantic Coast of the department\r\nof Cauca, formed by the Gulfo de Uraba, or Darian del Nord. Into this\r\ngulf flow the Atrato, Arboletes, Punta de Piedra and many small streams.\r\nExplorations on the Gulf of Uraba and its tributaries disclosed\r\nextensive strata of “oil-rock” and “oil-springs” near the Rio Arboletes.\r\nThe largest of forty of these springs has a twelve-inch crater, which\r\ngushes oil sufficient to fill a six-inch pipe. Near this Brobdignagian\r\nspring is a petroleum-pond sixty feet in diameter and from three to ten\r\nfeet deep. The flow of these oil-springs deserves the attention of\r\ngeologists and investors. They lie at a distance of one to three miles\r\nfrom the shores of the gulf. The oil is remarkably pure, passing through\r\na bed of coral, which seems to act as a filter and refiner. A proper\r\nsurvey of the oil-region of the Uraba would be interesting from a\r\nscientific and an industrial standpoint. The proper development of its\r\npossibilities might result in the control of the petroleum-market of\r\nSouth America. The climate is too sultry for the display of seal sacques\r\nand fur-overcoats, a palm-hat constituting the ordinary garb of the\r\naverage citizen. This providential dispensation eliminates dudes and\r\ntailor-made girls, stand-up collars and bifurcated skirts from the\r\ndomestic economy of the happy Isthmians.\r\n\r\nIn the canton of Santa Elena, Ecuador, embracing the entire area of\r\ncountry between the hot springs of San Vicinte and the Pacific coast,\r\npetroleum is found in abundance. It is of a black color, its density\r\nvaries, it is considered superior to the Pennsylvania product and is\r\nentirely free from offensive odor. Little has been done towards working\r\nthese wells. The people are unacquainted with the proper method of\r\nsinking them and no well has exceeded a few feet in depth. Geologists\r\nthink, when the strata of alumina and rock are pierced, reservoirs will\r\nbe found in the huge cavities formed by volcanic convulsions of the\r\nAndes. Venezuela is in the same boat.\r\n\r\nFrom the Chira to the Fumbes river, a desert waste\r\none-hundred-and-eighty miles in length and fifteen miles in width,\r\nlying along the coast between the Pacific ocean and the Andes, the\r\noil-field of Peru is believed to extend. For two centuries oil has\r\nbeen gathered in shallow pits and stored in vats, precisely as in\r\nPennsylvania. The burning sun evaporated the lighter parts, leaving a\r\nglutinous substance, which was purified and thickened to the\r\nconsistency of sealing-wax by boiling. It was shipped to southern\r\nports in boxes and used as glazing for the inside of Aguardiente jars.\r\nThe Spanish government monopolized the trade until 1830, when M. Lama\r\npurchased the land. In 1869 Blanchard C. Dean and Rollin Thorne,\r\nAmericans, “denounced” the mine, won a lawsuit brought by Lama and\r\ndrilled four wells two-hundred-and-thirty feet deep, a short distance\r\nfrom the beach. Each well yielded six to ten barrels a day, which\r\ndeeper drilling in 1871-2 augmented largely. Frederic Prentice, the\r\nenterprising Pennsylvania operator, secured an enormous grant in 1870,\r\nbored several wells—one a thousand-barreler—erected a refinery,\r\nsupplied the city of Lima with kerosene and exported considerable\r\nquantities to England and Australia. The war with Chili compelled a\r\ncessation of operations for some years. Dr. Tweddle, who had\r\nestablished a refinery at Franklin, tried to revive the Peruvian\r\nfields in 1887-8. He drilled a number of wells, refined the output,\r\nenlisted New-York capital and shipped cargoes of the product to San\r\nFrancisco. Hon. Wallace L. Hardison, who represented Clarion in the\r\nLegislature and operated at Bradford and in California, is now\r\nexploring the Peruvian field for flowing oil-wells and gold-nuggets.\r\nQualified judges have no doubt that, “in the sweet-bye-and-bye,” the\r\noleaginous goose may hang altitudinum in Peru.\r\n\r\nA larger percentage of the oil-product of the United States is sent\r\nabroad than of any other except cotton, while nearly every home in the\r\nland is blessed with petroleum’s beneficent light. America has toed the\r\nmark so grandly that the petroleum-industry is the one circus bigger\r\ninside the canvas than on the posters. Beginning with 1866, the exports\r\nof illuminating oils were doubled in 1868, again in 1871, again in 1877\r\nand again in 1891. The average exports per week in 1894 were as much as\r\nfor the entire year 1864. Not less impressive is the marvelous reduction\r\nin the price of refined, so that it has found a welcome everywhere.\r\nExport-oil averaged, in 1861, 61½ cents per gallon; in 1871, 23⅝ cents\r\nper gallon; in 1881, 8 cents per gallon; in 1891, 6⅞ cents per gallon;\r\nin 1892, 6 cents per gallon; in 1894, 5⅙ cents per gallon, or\r\none-twentieth that in 1861. But this decrease, great as it is, does not\r\nrepresent the real reduction in the price of oil, as the cost of the\r\nbarrel is included in these prices. A gallon of bulk-oil cost in 1861\r\nnot less than 58 cents; in 1894, not more than 3½ cents, or hardly\r\none-seventeenth. In January, 1871, the price was 75 cents; in January,\r\n1894, one-twenty-fifth that of thirty-three years before.

Scores of these wells pumped more or less oil long before\r\nit “entered into the mind of man” to utilize the unwelcome intruder.\r\nIndeed, so often were brine and petroleum found in the same geological\r\nformation that scientists ascribed to them a kindred origin. The first\r\nborings to establish this peculiarity were on the Kanawha River, in West\r\nVirginia, a state destined to play an important part in oleaginous\r\naffairs. Dr. J. P. Hale, a reputable authority, claims oil caused much\r\nannoyance in Ruffner Brothers’ salt-well, begun in 1806, bored sixty\r\nfeet with an iron-rod and two-inch chisel-bit attached by a rope to a\r\nspring-pole, completed in 1808 and memorable as the _first\r\nartesian-well_ on this continent. The fluid came from the territory once\r\nfamous as the “Kanawha Salines,” reputed to produce an unsurpassed\r\ntable-salt. Before the advent of the white man the Indians made salt\r\nfrom the saline springs a short distance above the site of Charleston.\r\nThere Daniel Boone had a log-cabin and George Washington, as long ago as\r\n1775, for military services was awarded lands containing a “burning\r\nspring.” Fired by the tidings of the saline springs, Joseph Ruffner sold\r\nhis possessions in the Shenandoah Valley and journeyed beyond the\r\nmountains in 1794 to establish salt-works on the Kanawha. He leased the\r\nsalt-interest to Elisha Brooks, who took brine from the shallow\r\nquicksands. Joseph Ruffner dying, his sons, Joseph and David, acquired\r\nhis lands and salt-springs and resolved to try some better plan of\r\nprocuring the brine. A section of a hollow sycamore-tree, sunk into the\r\nquicksands, suggested the idea of wooden casing and the wisdom of boring\r\na little way from the spring. A piece of oak, bored from end to end as\r\nlog-pumps used to be, was set in the hole. The ingenious brothers\r\ndevised a chisel-like drill to pierce the rock, fastened it to a rope\r\nfixed to a spring-pole and bounced the tools briskly. To shut out the\r\nweak brine above from the strong brine beneath they put in _tin-tubing_,\r\naround which they tied a _leather-bag_ filled with flax-seed. Thus,\r\nthree generations ago, Joseph and David Ruffner, aided later by William\r\nMorris and his invention of “jars” in drilling-tools, stumbled upon the\r\nbasis of casing, seed-bagging and boring oil-wells. All honor to the\r\nmemory of these worthy pioneers, groping in the dark to clear the road\r\nfor the great petroleum-boom! Dr. Hale continues:\r\n\r\n“Nearly all the Kanawha salt-wells have contained more or less\r\npetroleum, and some of the deeper wells a considerable flow. Many\r\npersons now think, trusting to their recollections, that some of the\r\nwells afforded as much as twenty-five to fifty barrels per day. This was\r\nallowed to flow over from the top of the salt-cisterns to the river,\r\nwhere, from its specific gravity, it spread over a large surface, and by\r\nits beautiful iridescent hues and not very savory odor could be traced\r\nfor many miles down the stream. It was from this that the river received\r\nthe nickname of ‘Old Greasy,’ by which it was long known by Kanawha\r\nboatmen and others.”\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of Hawkinberry Run, three miles north of Fairmount, in\r\nMarion county, a well for salt was put down in 1829 to the depth of\r\nsix-hundred feet. “A stinking substance gave great trouble,” an owner\r\nreported, “forming three or four inches on the salt-water tank, which\r\nwas four feet wide and sixteen feet long.” They discovered the stuff\r\nwould burn, dipped it off with buckets and consumed it for fuel under\r\nthe salt-pan. J. J. Burns in 1865 leased the farm, drilled the abandoned\r\nwell deeper, stuck the tools in the hole and had to quit after\r\npenetrating sixty feet of “a fine grit oil-rock.” Mr. Burns wrote in\r\n1871:\r\n\r\n“The second well put down in this county was about the year 1835, on the\r\nWest Fork River, just below what is now known as the Gaston mines. The\r\nwell was sunk by a Mr. Hill, of Armstrong county, Pa., who found\r\nsalt-water of the purest quality and in a great quantity, same as in the\r\nfirst well. He died just after the well was finished, so nothing was\r\ndone with it. About the time this well was completed one was drilled in\r\nthe Morgan settlement, just below Rivesville. Salt-water was found with\r\ngreat quantities of gas. Twenty-five years since the farmers on Little\r\nBingamon Creek formed a company and drilled a well—I think to a depth of\r\neight-hundred feet—in which they claimed to have found oil in paying\r\nquantities. You can go to it to-day and get oil out of it. The president\r\ntold me he saw oil spout out of the tubing forty or fifty feet, just as\r\nthey started the pump to test it. The company got to quarreling among\r\nthemselves, some of the stockholders died and part of the stock got into\r\nthe hands of minor heirs, so nothing more was done.”\r\n\r\nSimilar results attended other salt-wells in West Virginia. The first\r\noil-speculators were Bosworth, Wells & Co., of Marietta, Ohio, who as\r\nearly as 1843 bought shipments of two to five barrels of crude from\r\nVirginians who secured it on the Hughes River, a tributary of the Little\r\nKanawha. This was sold for medical purposes in Pittsburg, Baltimore, New\r\nYork and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nNotable instances of this kind occurred on the Allegheny River, opposite\r\nTarentum, twenty miles above Pittsburg, as early as 1800. Wells sunk for\r\nbrine to supply the salt-works were troubled with what the owners called\r\n“odd, mysterious grease.” Samuel M. Kier, a Pittsburg druggist, whose\r\nfather worked some of these wells, conceived the idea of saving the\r\n“grease,” which for years had run waste, and in 1846 he bottled it as a\r\nmedicine. He knew it had commercial and medicinal value and spared no\r\nexertions to introduce it widely. He believed implicitly in the greenish\r\nfluid taken from his salt-wells, at first as a healing agent and farther\r\non as an illuminant. A bottle of the oil, corked and labeled by Kier’s\r\nown hands, lies on my desk at this moment, in a wrapper dingy with age\r\nand redolent of crude. A four-page circular inside recites the good\r\nqualities of the specific in gorgeous language P. T. Barnum himself\r\nwould not have scorned to father. For example:\r\n\r\n“Kier’s Petroleum, or Rock Oil, Celebrated for its Wonderful Curative\r\nPowers. A Natural Remedy!

They are blended\r\ntogether in such a way as to defy all human competition. * * * Petroleum\r\nwill continue to be used and applied as a Remedy as long as man\r\ncontinues to be afflicted with disease. Its discovery is a new era in\r\nmedicine.”\r\n\r\nA host of certificates of astonishing cases of curable and incurable\r\nailments, from blindness to colic, followed this preliminary\r\nannouncement. The “remedy” was trundled about by agents in vehicles\r\nelaborately gilt and painted with representations of the Good Samaritan\r\nministering to a wounded Hebrew writhing in agony under a palm-tree. Two\r\nbarrels of oil a day were sold at fifty cents a half-pint. The expense\r\nof bottling and peddling it consumed the bulk of the profits. Kier\r\nexperimented with it for light, about 1848, burning it at his wells and\r\nracking his fertile brain for some means to get rid of the offensive\r\nsmoke and odor. To be entirely successful the oil must have some other\r\nthan this crude form. The tireless experimenter went to Philadelphia to\r\nconsult a chemist, who advised distillation, without a hint as to the\r\nnecessary apparatus. Fitting a kettle with a cover and a worm, the first\r\noutcome of the embryo refiner’s one-barrel still was a dark substance\r\nlittle superior to the crude. Learning to manage the fires so as not to\r\nsend the oil over too rapidly, by twice distilling he produced an\r\narticle the color of cider, which had a horrible smell, as he knew\r\nnothing of the treatment with acids that has revolutionized the light of\r\nthe world and brought petroleum to the front.\r\n\r\nSlight changes in the camphene-lamp enabled him to burn the distillate\r\nwithout smoke. Improvements in the lamp, especially the addition of the\r\n“Virna burner,” and in the quality of the fluid brought the\r\n“carbon-oil,” as it was usually termed, to a goodly measure of\r\nperfection. One lot of oil used in these experiments was a purchase of\r\nthree barrels in April, 1853, from Charles Lockhart, now an officer of\r\nthe Standard Oil-Company in Pittsburg. It came from the Huff well, a\r\nmile down the river from Tarentum. “Carbon-oil” sold readily for a\r\ndollar-fifty per gallon and provided a market for all the petroleum the\r\nsalt-wells in the vicinity could produce. The day was dawning and the\r\ngreat light of the nineteenth century had been foreshadowed in the broad\r\ncommonwealth that was to send it forth on its shining mission to all\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL M. KIER.]\r\n\r\nSamuel M. Kier slumbers in Allegheny cemetery, resting in peace “after\r\nlife’s fitful fever.” He was the first to appreciate the value of\r\npetroleum and to purify it by ordinary refining. His product was in\r\nbrisk demand for illuminating purposes. He invented a lamp with a\r\nfour-pronged burner, arranged to admit air and give a steady light. If\r\nhe failed to reap the highest advantage from his researches, to patent\r\nhis process and to sink wells for petroleum alone, he paved the way for\r\nothers, enlarged the field of the product’s usefulness and by his labors\r\nsuggested its extensive development. Has not he earned a monument more\r\nenduring than brass or marble?\r\n\r\n                    “As in a building\r\n            Stone rests on stone, and wanting the foundation\r\n            All would be wanting, so in human life\r\n            Each action rests on the foregoing event\r\n            That made it possible, but is forgotten\r\n            And buried in the earth.”\r\n\r\nThese operations at Tarentum and Pittsburg led to an extraordinary\r\nattempt to fathom the petroleum-basin by _digging_ to the oil-bearing\r\nrock! Through Kier’s experiments the crude had become worth from fifty\r\ncents to one dollar a gallon. Among the owners of Tarentum’s salt-wells\r\nwas Thomas Donnelly, who sold his well on the Humes farm to Peterson &\r\nIrwin. The senior partner, ex-Mayor Louis Peterson, of Allegheny, lived\r\nuntil recently to recount his interesting experiences with the coming\r\nlight. He thought the Donnelly well, which produced salt-water only, if\r\nenlarged and pumped vigorously, would produce oil. Humes received\r\ntwenty-thousand dollars for his farm. The hole was reamed out and\r\nyielded five barrels of petroleum a day. This was in 1856. A specimen\r\nsent to Baltimore was used successfully in oiling wool at the\r\ncarding-mills and the total production was shipped to that city for\r\neight years. Eastern capitalists bought the farm and well in 1864,\r\norganized “The Tarentum Salt-and-Oil-Company” and determined to dig a\r\nshaft down to the source of supply! The wells were four-hundred to\r\nfive-hundred feet deep. The officers of the company argued that it was\r\nfeasible to reach that far into the bowels of the earth with pick and\r\nshovel and discover a monstrous cave of brine and oil! They picked a\r\nspot twenty rods from the Donnelly well, sent to England for skilled\r\nminers and started a shaft about eight feet square. Over two years were\r\nemployed and forty-thousand dollars spent in sinking this shaft. Heavy\r\ntimbers walled the upper portion, the hard rock below needing none. The\r\nwater was pumped through iron-pipes, nine men formed each shift and the\r\nwork progressed merrily to the depth of four-hundred feet. Then the\r\nsalt-water in the Donnelly well was affected by the fresh-water in the\r\nshaft, losing half its strength whenever the latter was let stand a few\r\nhours, showing their intimate connection by veins or crevices. Mr.\r\nPeterson said of it:\r\n\r\n“The digging of the shaft was finally abandoned in the darkest period of\r\nthe war, from the necessities of the time. A New Yorker named Ferris,\r\nand Wm. McKeown, of Pittsburg, bought the property, shaft and all. The\r\ndaring piece of engineering was neglected and finally commenced to fill\r\nup with cinders and dirt, until at last it was level again with the\r\nsurface of the ground. You may walk over it to-day and I could point it\r\nout to you if I was up there. Dig it out and you will find those iron\r\npipes and timbers still there, just as they were originally put in.”\r\n\r\nDyed-in-the-wool Tarentumites insist that natural gas caused the\r\nsuspension of work, flowing into the shaft at such a gait that the\r\nminers refused to risk the chances of a speedy trip to Kingdom Come by\r\nsuffocation or the ignition of the subtile vapor. This was the case\r\nwith two shafts at Tidioute and Petroleum Centre, neither of them\r\nnearly the depth of “the daring piece of engineering” which “set the\r\npace” for enterprises of this novel brand. The New-York\r\nEnterprise-and-Mining-Company projected the former, intending to sink\r\na shaft eight feet by twelve to the third sand and tunnel the rock for\r\npetroleum by wholesale. The shaft reached oil-producing sand at\r\none-hundred-and-sixty feet. The miners worked in squads, eight-hour\r\nturns. Holes had been drilled into the rock at various angles and a\r\nlot of conglomerate brought to the surface. Once a short delay\r\noccurred in changing squads, during which the air-pump, employed to\r\nexhaust the gases from the pit and supply pure ozone from above, was\r\nlet stand idle. Mr. Hart was seated on a timber across the shaft when\r\nthe men were ready to go down. As was the custom, a man dropped a\r\ntaper into the opening to test the air. Natural gas had filled the\r\nshaft and it ignited from the burning torch, causing a terrific\r\nexplosion. The workmen were thrown in all directions and lay stunned\r\nand burned. When they regained consciousness Hart was nowhere to be\r\nseen and flames rose from the mouth of the pit to the tree-tops.\r\nHart’s body was eventually recovered from the bottom of the shaft,\r\nhorribly mangled and charred. Work was abandoned and the hole was\r\npartly filled up and covered, none caring to pry farther into the\r\npetroleum-secrets of nature. Were meddlers who seek to poke their\r\nnoses into the secrets of other people dealt with thus summarily, what\r\na thinning out of the population there would be!\r\n\r\nPeterson & Irwin’s treatment of the Donnelly well brings out clearly\r\nthat the sole object was to procure oil. This is important, in view of\r\nthe claim that the first well drilled exclusively for petroleum was put\r\ndown in 1859. Practically the two Pittsburgers anticipated this by three\r\nyears, a circumstance to remember when considering the varied events\r\nwhich led up to the petroleum development.\r\n\r\n“We do homage to the claims of the ancients and neglect those of later\r\ndate.”\r\n\r\nCharles Lockhart, still an honored resident of Pittsburg, may fairly\r\nclaim to be the oldest oil-operator in the United States. His first\r\ntransaction in petroleum was the purchase, in April of 1853, of three\r\nbarrels of crude from Isaac Huff, who brought the stuff in a skiff from\r\na salt-well at Tarentum. Huff sold the lot at thirty-two cents a gallon\r\nto his friend Lockhart, then connected with a leading mercantile house,\r\nand agreed to furnish him all the well produced during the year at the\r\nsame price. The contract might seem like an elephant on his hands, but\r\nLockhart’s faith in the new industry was not a plant too delicate to\r\nstand alone. Shrewd and far-seeing, the young dealer did not need a Lick\r\ntelescope with a Peate lens to discern that this “mysterious grease”\r\nmust soon be utilized for the general benefit. Believing a grand future\r\nwas about to dawn upon petroleum, he disposed of the Huff oil and\r\ncontract at a handsome profit to Samuel M. Kier, who had a small\r\nrefinery on Seventh Avenue and the old Canal, and at once secured\r\ncontrol of the Tarentum salt-works. From that date to the present—1853\r\nto 1897—a period of forty-four years, Charles Lockhart has been an\r\noil-producer, active in furthering the best interests of the business, a\r\nleader in improvements to foster its growth and never lacking the pluck\r\nand enterprise essential to the highest success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES LOCKHART.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH BATES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM FREW.]\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1859 he formed a partnership with William Frew, William\r\nPhillips, John Vanausdall and A. V. Kipp to lease lands and put down\r\noil-wells in Venango County. The five partners drilled on the Tarr Farm\r\nand the east bank of the Allegheny River. The Crystal Palace, an old\r\nkeel-boat that cost them twenty-five dollars, horses towed to Oil City\r\nwith their machinery and provisions. Accommodations were decidedly\r\nscarce in the settlement, just sprouting at the mouth of Oil Creek, and\r\nthe boat served the workmen as a lodging and boarding-place. They cooked\r\ntheir own meals, of which pork and beans, coffee and molasses were prime\r\nconstituents, washed their own clothes and not seldom carried flour\r\nthree miles into the country to have a farmer’s wife bake it into\r\ndigestible bread. The hardy fellows could navigate the Ohio or the\r\nAllegheny, brave the terrors of a Chilkoot Pass, punch a hole hundreds\r\nof feet into the rock, fry bacon to a turn and dish up a savory meal,\r\nbut baking real loaves stumped them every time. The first well—the\r\nAlbion, across the river—yielded forty barrels a day. From it, in March\r\nof 1860, the owners shipped sixty barrels of crude, per the steamboat\r\nVenango, Captain Reynolds commanding, _the first oil boated to\r\nPittsburg_ from the Pennsylvania oil-fields. It was hauled to the store\r\nof J. McCully & Co., on Wood street, near Liberty—Lockhart and Frew were\r\njunior members of the firm—and rolled upon the pavement. Much excitement\r\nfollowed the landing of the barrels, to which thick layers of Venago’s\r\nmud stuck wickedly. Hundreds of curious Pittsburgers viewed the\r\nimportation with extreme interest, curling their noses upwards as the\r\npetroleum-aroma assailed them with an odor resembling liquid Limburger\r\nrather than brut wine. Bungs were taken out to let visitors inspect the\r\nfluid, inhale the unmixed odor and wonder what “in the name of Sam Hill”\r\npeople wanted with “the nasty stuff.” A small refinery on the\r\nFifth-Avenue extension of the city paid thirty-four cents a gallon for\r\nthe oil. Such was the humble beginning of a traffic fated to outstrip\r\ncoal, iron and cotton and give even breadstuffs a stiff run for first\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n    “Perfection is made up of trifles, but perfection is no trifle.”\r\n\r\nThe quintette drilled numerous wells, one of them the largest on Oil\r\nCreek, and prospered greatly. Phillips, Vanausdall and Kipp sold out to\r\ntheir partners, who organized as Lockhart & Frew. It was an ideal union\r\nof capacity and capital, not a mismating of cut-glass aspiration with\r\ntin-cup attainment, and its wheel of fortune did not travel with a\r\npunctured tire. The new firm shipped extensively, built the Brilliant\r\nRefinery in 1861 and speedily stepped to the front in handling the\r\ngreasy staple. In May of 1860 Mr. Lockhart went to Europe with samples\r\nof crude and refined-distillate to establish a market in England. These\r\nwere _the first samples_ of crude-petroleum and its products ever\r\ncarried across the Atlantic. The mission was most successful, a large\r\nforeign demand springing up quickly. Lockhart & Frew exerted vast\r\ninfluence in the petroleum-trade, opened branch-agencies throughout the\r\noil-regions and eventually combined with the Standard Oil-Company. Major\r\nFrew, a man of rare sagacity and broad ideas, died in March of 1880. He\r\ndisliked ostentation, was quiet in his tastes and habits, managed the\r\naccounts and office-work of the firm with scrupulous exactness, was\r\nalways kindly and genial, helped the needy, served as treasurer of the\r\nChristian Commission and left a fine estate. Time has dealt gently with\r\nMr. Lockhart, who is young in heart and sympathy and good-fellowship.\r\nHis compliments have the juiciness of the peach, his pleasant jokes are\r\nspiced with originality, his years sit upon him lightly and his old\r\nfriends are not forgotten. He is happy in his social and business\r\nrelations, in recalling the past and awaiting the future, in wealth\r\ngained worthily and enjoyed wisely and in a life crowded with usefulness\r\nand blessing.\r\n\r\n               “A bough from an oak, not from a willow.”\r\n\r\nThe late Joseph Bates was closely associated with the early shippers of\r\npetroleum on the Allegheny River. He held the confidence of Lockhart &\r\nFrew and was esteemed everywhere for probity and enterprise. Coming to\r\nthe oil-regions in the sixties, he resided at Oil City many years and\r\noperated in different sections of the field. With his friends he was\r\never jaunty, jolly and perfectly at home. Judging by the French\r\nstandard, that a man is only as old as he feels, he had to the very end\r\nof his sixty years few juniors at Oil City, Parker, Petrolia or\r\nPittsburg. He was never ill-natured nor uncompanionable, whether his\r\nwells proved unexpectedly large or disappointingly small. His sunny\r\ncomposition bore no “thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice” to repel and\r\nchill those with whom he came in contact. His steadfast friend, Samuel\r\nB. Harper, who has had charge of the books from about the commencement\r\nof Lockhart & Frew’s partnership, is in Mr. Lockhart’s office to-day. A\r\nrecord so honorable to all concerned, with its long performance of duty\r\nand unwavering appreciation, is deserving of special remark in these\r\ndays of lightning-changes, impaired confidence and devil-may-care\r\nrecklessness generally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD OIL-SPRING IN OHIO.]\r\n\r\nOn an old map of the United States, printed in England in 1787, the\r\nword “petroleum” is marked twice, indicating that the “surface-shows”\r\nof oil had attracted the notice of the earliest explorers of Southern\r\nOhio and Northwestern Pennsylvania a century ago. In one instance it\r\nis placed at the mouth of the stream since famed the world over as Oil\r\nCreek, where Oil City is situated; in the other on a stream\r\nrepresented as emptying into the Ohio River, close to the site of what\r\nis now the village of Macksburg. When that section of Ohio was first\r\nsettled, various symptoms of greasiness were detected, thin films of\r\noil floating on the waters of Duck Creek and its tributaries, globules\r\nrising in different springs and seepings occurring frequently in the\r\nsame manner as in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Thirty miles north\r\nof Marietta, on Duck Creek, a salt-well sunk by Mr. McKee, in 1814, to\r\nthe depth of four-hundred-and-seventy-five feet, discharged\r\n“periodically, at intervals of from two to four days and from three to\r\nsix hours’ duration, thirty to sixty gallons of petroleum at each\r\ninception.” Eighteen years afterwards the discharges were less\r\nfrequent and the yield of oil diminished to one barrel a week, finally\r\nceasing altogether. Once thirty or forty barrels stored in a cistern\r\ntook fire from the gas at the well having been ignited by a workman\r\ncarrying a light. The burning oil ran into the creek, blazed to the\r\ntops of the trees and exhibited for hours to the amazed settlers the\r\nnovelty of a rivulet on fire. Ten miles above McConnellsville, on the\r\nMuskingum River, results almost identical attended the boring of\r\nsalt-wells in 1819. Dr. S. P. Hildreth, of Marietta, in an account of\r\nthe region, written that year, says of the borings for salt-water:\r\n\r\n“They have sunk two wells more than four-hundred feet; one of them\r\naffords a strong and pure water, but not in great quantity; the other\r\ndischarges such vast quantities of petroleum, or as it is vulgarly\r\ncalled “Seneca Oil,” and besides is subject to such tremendous\r\nexplosions of gas * * * that they make little or no salt. Nevertheless,\r\nthe petroleum affords considerable profit and is beginning to be in\r\ndemand for workshops and manufactories. It affords a clear, brisk light,\r\nwhen burned in this way, and will be a valuable article for lighting the\r\nstreet-lamps in the future cities of Ohio.”\r\n\r\nThe last sentence bears the force of a prophecy. Writing about the year\r\n1832 the same observant author directs attention to another peculiar\r\nfeature:\r\n\r\n“Since the first settlement of the regions west of the Appalachian range\r\nthe hunters and pioneers have been acquainted with this oil. Rising in a\r\nhidden and mysterious manner from the bowels of the earth, it soon\r\narrested their attention and acquired great value in the eyes of the\r\nsimple sons of the forest. * * * From its success in rheumatism, burns,\r\ncoughs, sprains etc., it was justly entitled to its celebrity. * * * It\r\nis also well adapted to _prevent friction in machinery_, for, being free\r\nof gluten, so common to animal and vegetable oils, it preserves the\r\nparts to which it is applied for a long time in free motion; where a\r\nheavy vertical shaft runs in a socket it is preferable to all or any\r\nother articles. This oil rises in greater or less abundance in most of\r\nthe salt-wells and, collecting where it rises, is removed from time to\r\ntime with a ladle.”\r\n\r\nIs it not strange that, with the sources of supply thus pointed out in\r\ndifferent counties and states and the useful applications of petroleum\r\nfairly understood, its real value should have remained unappreciated and\r\nunrecognized for more than thirty years and be at last determined\r\nthrough experiments upon the distillation of bituminous shales and\r\ncoals? Wells sunk hundreds of feet for salt water produced oil in\r\nabundance, yet it occurred to no one that, if bored expressly for\r\npetroleum, it could be found in paying quantity! Hamilton McClintock,\r\nowner of the “oil-spring” famed in history and romance, when somebody\r\nventured to suggest that he should _dig_ into the rock a short distance,\r\ninstead of skimming the petroleum with a flannel-cloth, retorted hotly:\r\n“I’m no blanked fool to dig a hole for the oil to get away through the\r\nbottom!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KENTUCKY’S FIRST OIL-WELL.]\r\n\r\nIf West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio played trumps in the exciting\r\ngame of Brine vs. Oil, Kentucky held the bowers. The home of James\r\nHarrod and Daniel Boone, Henry Clay and George D. Prentice was noted\r\nfor other things besides backwoods fighters, statesmanship, sparkling\r\njournalism, thoroughbred horses, superb women and moonshine-whiskey.\r\nOff in the southeast corner of Wayne county, near the northeast corner\r\nof a six-thousand-acre tract of wild land, David Beatty bored a well\r\nfor salt about the year 1818. The land extended four miles westward\r\nfrom the Big South Fork of the Cumberland River, its eastern boundary,\r\nand three miles down the Fork from Tennessee, its southern line. The\r\nwell was located on a strip of flat ground between the stream and a\r\nrocky bluff, streaked with veins of coal and limestone. Five yards\r\nfrom the water a hole nine feet square was dug ten feet to the rock\r\nand timbered. The well, barely three inches in diameter, was punched\r\none-hundred-and-seventy feet by manual labor, steam-engines not having\r\npenetrated the trackless forests of Wayne at that period. To the\r\nintense disgust of the workmen a black, sticky, viscid liquid\r\npersisted in coming up with the salt-water and a new location was\r\nchosen two miles farther down the creek. Extra care not to drill too\r\ndeep averted an influx of the disagreeable fluid which spoiled the\r\nfirst venture. Salt-works were established and flourished for years, a\r\nsimon-pure oasis in the interminable wilderness.\r\n\r\nBeatty was elected to Congress, serving his constituents faithfully and\r\nillustrating the Mulberry-Sellers policy of “the old flag and an\r\nappropriation.” He secured a liberal grant for a road to his property on\r\nthe South Fork and constructed a passable thoroughfare. Traces of deep\r\ncuttings, log-culverts and blasted rocks, still discernible amid the\r\nunderbrush that well-nigh hides them from view, are convincing evidences\r\nof the magnitude and difficulty of the task. “The rocky road to Dublin”\r\nwas a mere bagatelle in comparison with this long-deserted pathway.\r\n“Jordan is a hard road to travel,” says an old song, and the sentiment\r\nwould fit equally well in this case. At one rugged point holes were cut\r\nin a rock as steep as the roof of a house, to afford footing for the\r\nmules engaged in drawing salt from the works! Considering the roughness\r\nof the country, the height of the hills, the depth of the chasms and the\r\nscanty facilities available, Beatty’s road was quite as remarkable a\r\nfeat as Bonaparte’s passage across the Alps or Ben Butler’s “Dutch-Gap\r\nCanal.” Its spirited projector lived and died at Monticello, the\r\ncounty-seat, where his descendants resided until recently.\r\n\r\nThe abandoned well did not propose to be snuffed out unceremoniously or\r\nto enact the role of “Leah the Forsaken.” In its bright lexicon the word\r\nfail was not to be inserted merely because it was too fresh to\r\nparticipate in the salt-trade. Far from retiring permanently, it spouted\r\npetroleum at a Nancy-Hanks quickstep, filling the pit, running into the\r\nFork and covering mile after mile of the water with a top-dressing of\r\noil. Somehow the floating mass caught fire and mammoth pyrotechnics\r\nensued. The stream blazed and boiled and sizzled from the well to the\r\nCumberland River, thirty-five miles northward, calcining rocks and\r\nlicking up babbling brooks on its fiery march! Trees on its banks burned\r\nand blistered and charred to their deepest roots. Iron-pans at the\r\nsalt-wells got red-hot, shriveled, warped, twisted and joined the\r\njunk-pile! Was not that a sweet revenge for plucky No. 1, the well its\r\nowner “had no use for” and devoutly wished at the bottom of the sea?\r\n\r\nThe Chicago fire “couldn’t hold a candle” to this rural conflagration,\r\nwhich originated the expressive phrase of “hell with the lid off,”\r\napplied sixty years afterwards by James Parton to the flaming furnaces\r\nat Pittsburg. Unluckily, the region was populated so sparsely that few\r\nspectators had front seats at “the greatest show on earth.” The deluge\r\nof oil ceased eventually, the fire following suit. Anon the salt\r\nindustry began to languish and the works were dismantled. No more the\r\nforest-road echoed the sharp crack of the teamster’s whip or heard his\r\nlusty oaths. The district along the South Fork was left as silent as\r\n“the harp that once through Tara’s halls the soul of music shed,” ready\r\nto be labeled “Ichabod,” and tradition alone preserved the name and\r\nrecord of the “Beatty Well,” THE FIRST OIL-SPOUTER IN AMERICA!\r\n\r\n                To future generations tell\r\n                The story of the Beatty Well,\r\n                  The father of oil-spouters!\r\n                In spite of quips and jibes and sneers\r\n                  Of arrant cranks and doubters,\r\n                Whose forte is flinging wretched jeers,\r\n                It richly merits hearty cheers\r\n                  From true petroleum-shouters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. W. GODFREY HUNTER.]\r\n\r\nAccompanied by Dr. W. G. Hunter, and a native as guide, it was my good\r\nfortune to visit this memorable locality in 1877. The start was from\r\nBurksville, Cumberland county, the doctor’s home and my headquarters for\r\na twelvemonth. At Albany, Clinton county, sure-footed mules, the only\r\nanimals that could be ridden safely through the rough country, took the\r\nplace of our horses. Soon the last signs of civilization disappeared and\r\nwe plunged into the thick woods, a crooked, tortuous trail pointing the\r\nway. Hills, rocks, ravines, fallen trees and mountain-streams by turns\r\nimpeded our progress, as we rode in Indian file for thirty miles. Birds\r\ntwittered and snakes hissed at the invasion of their solitudes. Several\r\ntimes the path touched the line of Beatty’s forgotten road and once a\r\nruined cabin, with three grave-like mounds in a corner of the small\r\nclearing, met our gaze. The guide explained how, twenty years before,\r\nthe poor family tenanting the wretched hovel had been poisoned by eating\r\nsome kind of berries, the parents and their only child dying alone and\r\nunattended. No human eye beheld their struggles, no soft hand cooled the\r\nfevered brows of the sufferers whose lives went out in that desolate\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\n                 “Oh God! How hard it is to die alone!”\r\n\r\nProvisions in our saddle-bags, a clear brook and evergreen boughs\r\nsupplied us with food, drink and an open-air bed. Next morning we\r\ntraversed a broad plateau, ending abruptly at the top of a precipitous\r\nbluff a hundred feet high. Beneath us lay a stretch of bottom-land, with\r\nthe Big South Fork on its east side and the Cumberland Mountains rearing\r\ntheir bold crests five miles away. In the center of a patch of cleared\r\nground stood a shanty, built of poles and roofed with split slabs of\r\noak. From an open space in one end smoke escaped freely, showing that\r\nthe place was inhabited. Tethering the mules and throwing the saddles\r\nupon the grass, we crawled down a slope formed by the collapse of a\r\nportion of the bluff. A shot from my revolver—everybody carried a\r\npistol—shattered the atmosphere and brought the inmates to the side of\r\nthe dwelling. The father, mother, a child in arms and two boys entering\r\ntheir teens watched our approach. As we drew nigh they scampered into\r\nthe shanty and took refuge under a queer structure of rails, straw and\r\nblankets that did duty as a bed for the household! A blanket hung over\r\nthe space cut for a door. Drawing this aside, the frightened family\r\ncould be seen crouching on the bare soil, for the abode had neither\r\ndoor, window, floor nor chinking between the logs. It was quite unfit to\r\nshelter a decent porker. Not a chair, table, stove, looking-glass,\r\nbureau or any of the articles of furniture deemed necessary for modern\r\ncomfort was in sight! A bench hewn out of timber with an axe, two\r\nmetal-pots, some tin-dishes and knives and forks composed the domestic\r\noutfit! Yet it was “home” to the squalid beings huddled in the dark,\r\ndamp, musty angle farthest from the intruders who had dropped in upon\r\nthem as unexpectedly as a Peary meteor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THE BEATTY WELL IN 1877.]\r\n\r\nCalling them to come out and speak with us a moment, the woman appeared,\r\nbearing the inevitable baby. She was truly a revelation, with unkempt\r\nbrindle-hair and sallow skin to match. Her raiment consisted of a single\r\njean-garment, dirty and tattered beyond description, too narrow to\r\nencircle her waist and too short to reach within a dozen inches of her\r\nnaked feet. Compared with the flimsy toilet of “a living picture,” this\r\ncostume was simplicity itself. The poor creature smoked a cob-pipe\r\nviciously. A request to see her husband evoked the command: “Old man, I\r\nreckon you best git out hyer!” The “old man” heeded this summons and\r\nemerged from his hiding-place, trembling violently. His attire was in\r\nharmony with his wife’s, threadbare jean-pants and shirt comprising it.\r\nHead and feet were bare. His trembling ceased the instant he saw our\r\nguide, whom he knew and greeted cordially. Introductions followed and we\r\nasked if he could show us the way to the Beatty Well. He answered in\r\nperfect English, with the grace of a Chesterfield: “It will be the\r\ngreatest pleasure I have known for many a day.”\r\n\r\nA brisk walk brought us to the well. Dirt and leaves had filled the pit\r\nnearly level, forming a depression which one might pass without special\r\nnotice. Scraping away the rubbish, blackened fragments of the timbered\r\nwalls appeared. But not a drop of oil had issued from the veteran-well\r\nfor scores of years. One man alone survived of those who had gazed upon\r\nthe flow of petroleum previous to the fire which checked the greasian\r\ntide forever. He lived ten miles northwest and his short story was\r\nlearned on the return-trip by another route. The scattered rustics were\r\naccustomed to go to the well once or twice a year and dip enough oil to\r\nmedicate and lubricate whoever or whatever needed it. The fluid was dark\r\nand heavy and for years rose to within a few feet of the surface. At\r\nlength the well clogged up and was almost obliterated. The dim eyes of\r\nthe aged narrator sparkled as he recalled the big blaze, concluding with\r\nthe emphatic words: “It jes’ looked ez if the devil had hitched up the\r\nhull bottomless pit fur a torch-light percession!”\r\n\r\nExcept the squatter on the tract of land, which Dr. Hunter and myself\r\nhad secured the winter of our visit, the nearest settler lived five\r\nmiles distant! The Cincinnati-Southern Railroad, now the Queen &\r\nCrescent route, had not crossed the meandering Kentucky River and the\r\ncountry was practically inaccessible. Men and women grew up without ever\r\nhearing of a church, a school, a book, a newspaper, a preacher, a\r\ndoctor, a wheeled vehicle or a lucifer-match! The heathen of\r\nBariaboola-Gha were as well informed concerning God and a future state.\r\nThey herded in miserable cabins, lived on “corn-dodgers and sow-belly,”\r\ndrank home-made whiskey and never wandered ten miles from their own\r\nfireside. Of the great outside world, of moral obligations, of religious\r\nconviction and of current events they were profoundly ignorant. Think of\r\npeople fifty, sixty, seventy years old, born and reared in the United\r\nStates, who never saw a loaf of wheat-bread, a wagon, a cart or a\r\nbaby-carriage, to say nothing of a plum-pudding, railway-coach, a\r\ntrolley-car or a tandem-bicycle! It seems incredible, in this advanced\r\nage and bang-up nation, that such conditions should be possible, yet\r\nthey existed in Southeastern Kentucky. And the American eagle flaps his\r\nwings, while Americans boast of their culture and send barrels of cold\r\ncash to buy flannel-shirts for perspiring Hottentots and goody-goody\r\ntracts for jolly cannibals!\r\n\r\n                        “Consistency’s a jewel.”\r\n\r\nSmall need of barbed-wire fences to shut out the cattle and chickens of\r\nneighbors five miles apart! Their children did not quarrel and sulk and\r\nyell “You can’t play in our yard!” Our host, who took us over the\r\nproperty and told us all he knew about it, had not seen a strange face\r\nfor twenty-nine weary months! Then the neighbor five miles off had come\r\nin the vain search of a cruse of oil from the old well to rub on an\r\nafflicted hog! Three years had rolled by since his last expedition to\r\nthe cross-roads, fourteen miles away, to trade “coon-skins” for jeans\r\nand groceries. Could isolation be more complete? Was Alexander Selkirk\r\nless blessed with companionship on his secluded island? Had Coleridge’s\r\nAncient Mariner, “on a wide, wide sea,” greater cause for an attack of\r\nthe blues?\r\n\r\nThe steel-track and the iron-horse are prime civilizers and eighteen\r\nyears have wrought a wondrous change in the section bordering upon the\r\nCumberland Mountains. The schoolmaster has come in with the railroad and\r\nimprovement is the prevailing order. Farmers have turned their forests\r\ninto cultivated fields and bought the latest implements. Their boys read\r\nthe papers, yearn for the city, smoke cigarettes, dabble in politics and\r\ndream of unbounded wealth. The girls, no longer content with homespun\r\nfrocks and sunbonnets, dress in silk and velvet, wear stylish hats,\r\ndevour French novels, sport high-heeled shoes and balloon-sleeves, play\r\nBeethoven and Chopin, waltz divinely and are altogether lovable!\r\n\r\nAn apparition muttering “I am thy father’s ghost” would not have\r\nsurprised us so much as the politeness of our half-clad, barefooted,\r\nbareheaded pilot to the neglected well. His manners and his language\r\nwere faultless. Not a coarse word or grammatical error marred his fluent\r\nspeech. At noon he invited us to share his humble dinner, apologizing\r\nwith royal dignity for the poverty of his surroundings. “Gentlemen,” he\r\nsaid, “I regret that parched corn and fat bacon are all I can offer, but\r\nI beg you to honor me with your presence at my table!” Remembering the\r\ncabin and its presiding divinity, we felt obliged to decline and\r\nrequested him to lunch with us. It was a positive pleasure to see with\r\nwhat relish he ate the baked chicken, biscuit and good things Mrs.\r\nHunter had packed in our saddle-bags. After the meal we prepared to\r\ndepart. The end of a Louisville paper under the flap of my saddle\r\nattracted the old man’s attention.\r\n\r\n“Is that a newspaper?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Yes, do you want it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you a thousand times! It is fifteen years since I have seen a\r\npaper and this will be such a treat!”\r\n\r\nHe seized the sheet eagerly, dropped upon the grass and glanced over the\r\nprinted page. In an instant he jumped to his feet and tears coursed down\r\nhis wrinkled cheeks.\r\n\r\n“I did not mean to be rude,” he said earnestly, “but you cannot imagine\r\nhow my feelings mastered me, after so many years of separation from the\r\nworld, at sight of a paper from the city of my birth!”\r\n\r\nThe next moment the good-byes were uttered and we had left the hermit of\r\nSouth Fork, to meet no more this side of eternity. He stood peering\r\nafter us until the woods shut us from his wistful gaze. Six years later\r\ndeath, the grim detective no vigilance can elude, claimed the guardian\r\nof the Beatty Well. His family removed to parts unknown. He rests in an\r\nunmarked grave, beneath a spreading oak, near the murmuring stream. The\r\nlonely exile has reached home at last!\r\n\r\nWho on earth was this educated, courteous, gentlemanly personage, and\r\nhow did he drift into such a place? This perplexing problem beat the\r\nfifteen-puzzle, “Pigs in Clover,” or the confusing dogma of Freewill and\r\nPredestination. Our guide enlightened us. The old man was reared in\r\nLouisville, graduated from college and entered an office to study law.\r\nIn a bar-room row one night a young man, with whom he had some trouble,\r\nwas stabbed fatally. Fearing he would be accused of the deed, the\r\nstudent fled to the woods. For years he shunned mankind, subsisting on\r\ngame and fruit and sleeping in a cave. Every rustling leaf or snapping\r\ntwig terrified him with the idea that officers were at his heels.\r\nUltimately he gained courage and sought the acquaintance of the few\r\nsettlers in his vicinity. Striving to forget the past, he cohabited with\r\nthe woman he called his wife, erected a shanty and brought up three\r\nchildren. Fire destroyed his hut and its contents, leaving him\r\ndestitute, and he located where we met him. The fear of arrest could not\r\nbe shaken off and he supposed we had come to take him a prisoner, after\r\ntwenty-five years of hiding, for a crime of which he was innocent. This\r\nexplained his retreat under the bed and violent trembling. He carried\r\nhis secret in his own bosom until 1873, when he was believed to be dying\r\nand disclosed it to a friend, our guide, with a sealed letter giving his\r\ntrue name. He recovered, the letter was handed back unopened and the\r\nfugitive’s identity was never revealed. What an existence for a man of\r\nrefinement and collegiate training! What volumes of unwritten,\r\nunsuspected tragedies environ us, could we but pierce the outward mask\r\nand read the tablets of the heart!\r\n\r\nEight or ten years ago J. O. Marshall, a Pennsylvania oil-operator,\r\ncleaned out the Beatty Well and drilled another a half-mile north.\r\nNeither yielded any oil, although the second was put down nine-hundred\r\nfeet. Mr. Marshall leased a great deal of land in Wayne and adjacent\r\ncounties, expecting to operate extensively, but he died without seeing\r\nhis purposes accomplished. He was a genial, enterprising, whole-souled\r\nfellow, whose faith in Kentucky as an oil-field never faltered.\r\n\r\nDr. Hunter, my esteemed associate on many a delightful trip, was\r\npracticing at Newcastle, Pa., when the civil war broke out. He sold his\r\ndrug-store, offered his services to the Government and was placed in\r\ncharge of a medical department, where he made a first-class record. He\r\namputated the leg of General James A. Beaver, subsequently Governor of\r\nPennsylvania. At the close of the war he settled in Cumberland county,\r\nmarried a prominent young lady, built up an immense practice and\r\nacquired a competence. He served with signal ability and credit in the\r\nLegislature and in Congress, elected time and again in a district\r\noverwhelmingly against his party. He was chairman of the Republican\r\nState-Committee, and ought to be the successor of Blackburn in the\r\nUnited-States Senate.\r\n\r\nSeventy years ago William Morris, a practical driller, whose name oilmen\r\nshould perpetuate, invented the contrivance that culminated in “jars”\r\nfor drilling-tools. This contrivance, which enabled the Ruffners and\r\nother salt-borers to go a thousand feet or more for brine, renders it\r\npossible to drill a mile for oil, if ambitious operators desire to get\r\nso far towards the antipodes. The manner in which the oil-resources of\r\nWest Virginia, Ohio and Kentucky were thrown away by the early pioneers\r\nis a surprising feature in the history of human affairs. Fifty years\r\nbefore Pennsylvania oil-wells had been heard of the Kanawha salt-seekers\r\nwere drilling what to-day would be paying oil-wells. Instead of saving\r\nthe oil, which is enriching West Virginia operators now, they wasted it\r\nand saved the salt-water. They wasted the natural gas, the best fuel of\r\nthe century, and boiled their salt-water with wood, the most expensive\r\nand least satisfactory fuel of the valley. That is often the way\r\nhumanity gropes in the dark. The men who rushed to California drove\r\ntheir ox-wagons past the big bonanzas of the Comstock lode, while the\r\nmen who later went to the Comstock went past the rich carbonates of\r\nLeadville, just as later prospectors ran over the Cripple-Creek silver\r\nand gold-leads in the search for things farther distant and the crowds\r\nhurrying to Alaska ignored the teeming ledges of the Black Hills. The\r\nKanawha salt-men scorned the oil, yet drilled the first oil-wells, and\r\nin doing it invented the methods which have come into use throughout the\r\nentire oil-territory. If Joseph and David Ruffner and William Morris had\r\ndisplayed half the wisdom in utilizing the oil they manifested in\r\ninventing tools to find salt-water, theirs would be the familiar names\r\nin Oildom down to the end of time.\r\n\r\n“Fellow-citizens,” shouted a free-silver orator to a host of starving\r\ncoal-miners three months after the last Presidential inauguration, “they\r\ntell us Major McKinley is the advance-agent of prosperity, but, if so,\r\nhe seems to be a deuce of a way ahead of the show!” In like fashion the\r\nRuffners were a long way ahead of the petroleum-development, but the\r\nshow got there at last, heralded by salt-wells that pointed unerringly\r\ntowards the dawn.\r\n\r\n                            THEY NOTICED IT.\r\n\r\nWriting of several Jesuits who, about 1642, penetrated the territory of\r\nthe Eries, probably near what is now Cuba, N. Y., Charlevoix says:\r\n\r\n“They found a thick, oily, stagnant matter which would burn like\r\nbrandy.”\r\n\r\nThe map of the Missionaries Dollier and Galinèe, printed in 1670, has a\r\nhint of the presence of petroleum in the north-western part of New York.\r\nNear the spot which was to become the site of Cuba these words are\r\nmarked:\r\n\r\n“Fonteaine de Bitume.”\r\n\r\nIn 1700 the Earl of Bellmont, Governor of New York, thus instructed\r\nEngineer Wolfgang W. Romer to visit the Five Nations:\r\n\r\n“You are to go and view a well or spring which is eight miles beyond the\r\nSeneks’ farthest castle, which they told me blazes up in a flame when a\r\nlighted coal or firebrand is put into it. You will do well to taste the\r\nsaid water and * * * bring with you some of it.”\r\n\r\nSir William Johnson, who visited Niagara in 1767, in his journal says\r\nwith reference to the spring at Cuba:\r\n\r\n“Arcushan came in with a quantity of curious oyl, taken at the top of\r\nthe water of some very small lake near the village he belongs to.”\r\n\r\nDavid Leisberger, the Moravian Missionary, went up the Allegheny River\r\nin 1767, established a mission near the mouth of Tionesta Creek and in\r\n1770 removed to Butler county. His manuscript records:\r\n\r\n“I have seen three kinds of oil-springs—such as have an outlet, such as\r\nhave none and such as rise from the bottom of the creeks. From the first\r\nwater and oil flow out together, the oil impregnating the grass and\r\nsoil; in the second it gathers on the surface of the water to the depth\r\nof the thickness of a finger; from the third it rises to the surface and\r\nflows with the current of the creek. The Indians prefer wells without an\r\noutlet. From such they first dip the oil that has accumulated, then stir\r\nthe well and, when the water has settled, fill their kettles with fresh\r\noil, which they purify by boiling. It is used medicinally, as an\r\nointment for toothache, headache, swellings, rheumatism and sprains.\r\nSometimes it is taken internally. It is of a brown color and can also be\r\nused in lamps. It burns well.”\r\n\r\nDr. John David Schopf, a surgeon in the British service, visited\r\nPittsburg in 1783 and in an account of his journey remarked:\r\n\r\n“Petroleum was found at several places up the Allegheny, particularly at\r\na spring and a creek, which were covered with this floating substance.”\r\n\r\nGeneral William Irvine, in a letter to John Dickinson, dated “Carlisle,\r\nAugust 17, 1785,” tells of exploring the western part of Pennsylvania.\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n“Oil Creek takes its name from an oily or bituminous matter being found\r\nfloating on its surface. Many cures are attributed to this oil. * * * It\r\nrises in the bed of the creek at very low water. In a dry season I am\r\ntold it is found without any mixture of water and is pure oil. It rises\r\nwhen the creek is high from the bottom in small globules.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Henry Loskiel, in his “Geschichte der Mission der Evangelischen\r\nBruder unter der Indianen in Nordamerika,” published in 1789, noted:\r\n\r\n“One of the most favorite medicines used by the Indians is Fossil-oil\r\nexuding from the earth, commonly with water * * * This oil is of a brown\r\ncolor and smells like tar. * * * They use it chiefly in external\r\ncomplaints. Some take it inwardly and it has not been found to do harm.\r\nIt will burn in a lamp. The Indians sometimes sell it to the white\r\npeople at four guineas a quart.”\r\n\r\nAn officer of the United States Army, who descended the Ohio River in\r\n1811, wrote a book of travels in which he remarks:\r\n\r\n“Not far from the mouth of the Little Beaver a spring has been found,\r\nsaid to rise from the bottom of the river, from which issues an oil\r\nwhich is highly inflammable and is called Seneca oil. It resembles\r\nBarbadoes tar and is used as a remedy for rheumatic pains.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTABLE WELLS ON OIL CREEK IN 1861-2-3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n                      WHERE THE BLUE-GRASS GROWS.\r\n\r\nINTERESTING PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENTS IN KENTUCKY AND TENNESSEE—THE FAMOUS\r\n    AMERICAN WELL—A BOSTON COMPANY TAKES HOLD—PROVIDENTIAL\r\n    ESCAPE—REGULAR MOUNTAIN VENDETTA—A SUNDAY LYNCHING PARTY—PECULIAR\r\n    PHASES OF PIETY—AN OLD WOMAN’S WELCOME—WARM RECEPTION—STORIES OF\r\n    RUSTIC SIMPLICITY.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n“He who would search for pearls must dive below.”—_Dryden_.\r\n\r\n“Often do the spirits of great events stride on before the\r\n    events.”—_Coleridge._\r\n\r\n“Coming events cast their shadows before.”—_Thomas Campbell._\r\n\r\n“In Cumberland county, Kentucky, a run of pure oil was struck.”—_Niles’\r\n    Register, A.

Hardy breadwinners, braving the\r\nhardships and privations of pioneer-life in the backwoods, early in this\r\ncentury settled much of the country along the Cumberland River. Upon one\r\nsection of irregular shape, its southern end bordered by Tennessee, the\r\nstate of Davy Crockett and Andrew Jackson, the name of the winding river\r\nintersecting it was appropriately bestowed. A central location, between\r\nthe west bank of the Cumberland and the foot of a lordly hill, was\r\nselected for the county-seat and christened Burksville, in honor of a\r\nrespected citizen who owned the site of the embryo hamlet. From a\r\ncross-roads tavern and blacksmith-shop the place expanded gradually into\r\nan inviting village of one-thousand population. It has fine stores, good\r\nchurches and schools, a brick court-house, and for years it boasted the\r\nonly college in Kentucky for the education of girls.\r\n\r\nBurksville pursued “the even tenor of its way” slowly and surely. Forty\r\nmiles from a railroad or a telegraph-wire, its principal outlet is the\r\nriver during the season of navigation. The Cumberland retains the\r\nfashion of rising sixty to eighty feet above its summer-level when the\r\nwinter rains set in and dwindling to a mere brooklet in the dry, hot\r\nmonths. Old-timers speak of “the flood of 1826” as the greatest in the\r\nhistory of the community. The rampant waters overflowed fields and\r\nstreets, invaded the ground-floors of houses and did a lot of unpleasant\r\nthings, the memory of which tradition has kept green. In January of 1877\r\nthe moist experience was repeated almost to high-water mark. Saw-logs\r\nfloated into kitchens and parlors and improvised skiffs navigated\r\nback-yards and gardens. Seldom has the town cut a wide swath in the\r\nmetropolitan press, because it avoided gross scandals and attended\r\nstrictly to home-affairs. The chief dissipation is a trip by boat to\r\nNashville or Point-Burnside, or a drive overland to Glasgow, the\r\nterminus of a branch of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad.\r\n\r\nThe first great event to stir the hearts of the good people of\r\nCumberland county occurred in 1829. A half-mile from the mouth of Rennix\r\nCreek, a minor stream that empties into the Cumberland two miles north\r\nof the county-town, a well was sunk one-hundred-and-eighty feet for\r\nsalt-water. Niles’ _Register_, published the same year, told the tale\r\nsuccinctly:\r\n\r\n“Some months since, in the act of boring for salt-water on the land of\r\nMr. Lemuel Stockton, situated in the county of Cumberland, Kentucky, a\r\nrun of pure oil was struck, from which it is almost incredible what\r\nquantities of the substance issued. The discharges were by floods, at\r\nintervals of from two to five minutes, at each flow vomiting forth many\r\nbarrels of pure oil. I witnessed myself, on a shaft that stood upright\r\nby the aperture in the rock from which it issued, marks of oil 25 or 30\r\nfeet perpendicularly above the rock. These floods continued for three or\r\nfour weeks, when they subsided to a constant stream, affording many\r\nthousand gallons per day. This well is between a quarter and a half-mile\r\nfrom the bank of the Cumberland River, on a small rill (creek) down\r\nwhich it runs to the Cumberland. It was traced as far down the\r\nCumberland as Gallatin, in Sumner county, Tennessee, nearly a hundred\r\nmiles. For many miles it covered the whole surface of the river and its\r\nmarks are now found on the rocks on each bank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAMOUS “AMERICAN WELL.”]\r\n\r\n“About two miles below the point on which it touched the river, it was\r\nset on fire by a boy, and the effect was grand beyond description. An\r\nold gentleman who witnessed it says he has seen several cities on fire,\r\nbut that he never beheld anything like the flames which rose from the\r\nbosom of the Cumberland to touch the very clouds.”\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of what was afterwards known from the equator to\r\nthe poles as the “American Well.” The flow of oil spoiled the well for\r\nsalt and the owners quitted it in disgust, sinking another with better\r\nsuccess in an adjacent field. For years it remained forsaken, an object\r\nof more or less curiosity to travelers who passed close by on their way\r\nto or from Burksville. It was very near the edge of the creek, on flat\r\nground most of which has been washed away. Neighboring farmers dipped\r\noil occasionally for medicine, for axle-grease and—“tell it not in Gath,\r\npublish it not in Askelon”—to kill vermin on swine!\r\n\r\nJob Moses, a resident of Buffalo, N. Y., visited the locality about the\r\nyear 1848. He had read of the oil-springs in New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nWest Virginia and Ohio and he decided that the hole on Rennix Creek\r\nought to be a prize-package. His moderate offer for the well was\r\naccepted by the Bakers, into whose hands the Stockton tract had come. He\r\ndrilled the well to four-hundred feet and erected a pumping-rig. The\r\nfive or six barrels a day of greenish-amber fluid, 42° gravity, he put\r\nup in half-pint bottles, labeled “American Rock Oil” and sold at fifty\r\ncents, commending it as a specific for numberless complaints. He reaped\r\na harvest for several years, until trade languished and the well was\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nWith the proceeds of his enterprise Moses bought a large block of land\r\nat Limestone, N. Y., adjoining the northern boundary of McKean county,\r\nPa., and built a mansion big enough for a castle. He farmed\r\nextensively, raised herds of cattle, employed legions of laborers and\r\ndispensed a bountiful hospitality. In 1862-3 he drilled three wells\r\nnear his dwelling, finding a trifling amount of gas and oil. Had he\r\ndrilled deeper he would inevitably have opened up the phenomenal\r\nBradford field a dozen years in advance of its actual development.\r\nWells twelve-hundred to three-thousand feet deep had not been dreamt\r\nof in petroleum-philosophy at that date, else Job Moses might have\r\ndiverted the whole current of oil-operations northward and postponed\r\nindefinitely the advent of the Clarion and Butler districts! Boring a\r\nfour-inch hole a few hundred feet farther would have done it!\r\n\r\nOn what small causes great effects sometimes depend! Believing a\r\nsnake-story induced our first parents to sample “the fruit of that\r\nforbidden tree whose mortal taste brought sin into our world and all our\r\nwoe.” Ambition to be a boss precipitated Lucifer “from the battlements\r\nof heaven to the nethermost abyss.” A dream released Joseph from prison\r\nto be “ruler over Egypt.” The smiles of a wanton plunged Greece into war\r\nand wiped Troy from the face of the earth. A prod on the heel slew\r\nAchilles, a nail—driven by a woman at that—finished Sisera and a pebble\r\nended Goliath. The cackling of a goose saved Rome from the barbarous\r\nhordes of Brennus. A cobweb across the mouth of the cave secreting him\r\npreserved Mahomet from his pursuers and gave Arabia and Turkey a new\r\nreligion.

The movements of a\r\nspider inspired Robert Bruce to renewed exertions and secured the\r\nindependence of Scotland. An infected rag in a bundle of Asiatic goods\r\nscourged Europe with the plague.

Statistics\r\nfail to disclose the awful havoc wrought in millions of homes by such\r\nobservations, on the part of thoughtless young husbands, as “this isn’t\r\nthe way mother baked,” or “mother’s coffee didn’t taste like this!”\r\n\r\nMoses lived to produce oil from his farms and to witness, five miles\r\nsouth of Limestone, the grandest petroleum-development of any age or\r\nnation. He was built on the broad-gauge plan, physically and mentally,\r\nand “the light went out” peacefully at last. The Kentucky well was never\r\nrevived. The rig decayed and disappeared, a timber or two lingering\r\nuntil carried off by the flood in 1877.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOVERNOR AMES.]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1876 Frederic Prentice, a leading operator, engaged me\r\nto go to Kentucky to lease and purchase lands for oil-purposes. Shortly\r\nbefore Christmas he wished me to meet him in New York and go from there\r\nto Boston, to give information to parties he expected to associate with\r\nhim in his Kentucky projects. Together we journeyed to the city of\r\nculture and baked-beans and met the gentlemen in the office of the\r\nUnion-Pacific Railroad-Company. The gathering was quite notable. Besides\r\nMr. Prentice, who had long been prominent in petroleum affairs, Stephen\r\nWeld, Oliver Ames, Sen., Oliver Ames, Jun., Frederick Ames, F. Gordon\r\nDexter and one or two others were present. Mr. Weld was the richest\r\ncitizen of New England, his estate at his death inventorying twenty-two\r\nmillions. The elder Oliver Ames, head of the giant shovel-manufacturing\r\nfirm of Oliver Ames & Sons, was a brother of Oakes Ames, the creator of\r\nthe Pacific Railroads, whom the Credit-Mobilier engulfed in its ruthless\r\ndestruction of statesmen and politicians. His nephew and namesake was a\r\nson of Oakes Ames and Governor of Massachusetts in 1887-8-9. He began\r\nhis career in the shovel-works, learning the trade as an employé, and at\r\nthirty-five had amassed a fortune of ten-millions. He occupied the\r\nfinest house in Boston, entertained lavishly, spent immense sums for\r\npaintings and bric-a-brac and died in October of 1895. Frederick Ames,\r\nson of the senior Oliver, has inherited his father’s executive talent\r\nand he maintains the family’s reputation for sagacity and the\r\nacquisition of wealth. F. Gordon Dexter is a multi-millionaire, a power\r\nin the railroad-world and a resident of Beacon street, the swell avenue\r\nof the Hub.\r\n\r\nSuch were the men who heard the reports concerning Kentucky. They did\r\nnot squirm and hesitate and wonder where they were at. Thirty-five\r\nminutes after entering the room the “Boston Oil Company” was organized,\r\nthe capital was paid in, officers were elected, a lawyer had started to\r\nget the charter and authority was given me to draw at sight for whatever\r\ncash was needed up to one-hundred-thousand dollars! This record-breaking\r\nachievement was about as expeditious as the Chicago grocer, who closed\r\nhis store one forenoon and pasted on the door a placard inscribed in\r\nbold characters: “At my wife’s funeral—back in twenty minutes!”\r\n\r\nOliver Ames, the future governor, invited the party to lunch at the\r\nParker House, Boston’s noted hostelry. An hour sped quickly. My\r\nreturn-trip had been arranged by way of Buffalo and the Lake-Shore Road\r\nto Franklin. The time to start arrived, the sleigh to take me to the\r\ndepot was at the door, the good-byes were said, the driver tucked in the\r\nrobes and grasped the lines. At that instant Oliver Ames, Sen., called:\r\n“Please come into the hotel one moment; I want to jot down something you\r\ntold us about the American Well.” The other gentlemen looked on, the\r\nexplanation was penciled rapidly, my seat in the sleigh was resumed and\r\nMr. Dexter jokingly said to the Jehu: “You’ll have to hustle, or your\r\nfare will miss his train!”\r\n\r\nThrough the narrow, twisted, crowded streets the horses trotted briskly.\r\nRushing into the station, the train was pulling out and the\r\nticket-examiner was shutting the iron-gates. He refused to let me\r\nattempt to catch the rear car and my disappointment was extreme. A train\r\nfor New York and Pittsburg left in fifteen minutes. It bore me, an\r\nunwilling passenger, safely and satisfactorily to the “Smoky City.”\r\nThere the news reached me of the frightful railway-disaster at\r\nAshtabula, in which P. P. Bliss and fourscore fellow-mortals, filled\r\nwith fond anticipations of New-Year reunions, perished in the icy waters\r\nninety feet beneath the treacherous bridge that dropped them into the\r\nyawning chasm! The doomed train was the same that would have borne me to\r\nAshtabula and—to death, had not Mr. Ames detained me to make the entry\r\nin his memorandum-book! Call it Providence, Luck, Chance, what you will,\r\nan incident of this stamp is apt to beget “a heap of tall thinking.”\r\n\r\n               “There’s a divinity that shapes our ends.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIRL CLIMBING A DERRICK.]\r\n\r\nReturning to Burksville in January, the work of leasing went ahead\r\nmerrily. The lands around the American Well were taken at one-eighth\r\nroyalty. Forty rods northeast of the American, in a small ravine, a well\r\nwas drilled eight-hundred feet. At two-hundred feet some gas and oil\r\nappeared, but the well proved a failure. While it was under way the gas\r\nin a deserted salt-well twenty rods northwest of the American burst\r\nforth violently, sending frozen earth, water and pieces of rock high\r\ninto the air. The derrick at the Boston Well, rising to the height of\r\nseventy-two feet, was a perennial delight to the natives. Youths, boys\r\nand old men ascended the ladder to the topmost round to enjoy the\r\nbeautiful view. Pretty girls longed to try the experiment and it was\r\nwhispered that six of them, one night when only the man in the moon was\r\npeeping, performed the perilous feat. Certain it is that a winsome\r\nteacher at the college, who climbed the celestial stair years ago,\r\nsucceeded in the effort and wrecked her dress on the way back to solid\r\nground. A dining-room girl at Petrolia, in 1873, stood on top of a\r\nderrick, to win a pair of shoes banteringly offered by a jovial oilman\r\nto the first fair maiden entitled to the prize. Lovely woman and\r\nBanquo’s ghost will not “down!”\r\n\r\nThree miles northeast of the American Well, at the mouth of Crocus\r\nCreek, C. H. English drilled eight shallow wells in 1865. They were\r\nbunched closely and one flowed nine-hundred barrels a day.\r\nTransportation was lacking, the product could not be marketed and the\r\npromising field was deserted. Twelve years later the Boston Oil-Company\r\ndrilled in the midst of English’s cluster, to discover the quality of\r\nthe strata, and could not exhaust the surface-water by the most\r\nincessant pumping. The company also drilled on the Gilreath farm, across\r\nthe Cumberland from Burksville, where Captain Phelps found heavy oil in\r\npaying quantity back in the sixties. The well produced nicely and would\r\nhave paid handsomely had a railroad or a pipe-line been within reach. A\r\nwell two miles west of the American, drilled in 1891, had plenty of sand\r\nand showed for a fifty-barreler.\r\n\r\nSix miles south-west of Burksville, at Cloyd’s Landing, J. W. Sherman,\r\nof Oil-Creek celebrity, drilled a well in 1865 which spouted a thousand\r\nbarrels of 40° gravity oil in twenty-four hours. He loaded a barge with\r\noil in bulk, intending to ship it to Nashville. The ill-fated craft\r\nstruck a rock in the river and the oil floated off on its own hook.\r\nSherman threw up the sponge and returned to Pennsylvania. Three others\r\non the Cloyd tract started finely, but the wonderful excitement at\r\nPithole was breaking out and operations elsewhere received a cold chill.\r\nDr. Hunter purchased the Cloyd farm and leased it in 1877 to Peter\r\nChristie, of Petrolia, who did not operate on any of the lands he\r\nsecured in Kentucky and Tennessee. Micawber-like, Cumberland county is\r\n“waiting for something to turn up” in the shape of facilities for\r\nhandling oil. When these are assured the music of the walking-beam will\r\ntickle the ears of expectant believers in Kentucky as the coming\r\noil-field.\r\n\r\nWayne and Cumberland had been heard from and Clinton county was the\r\nthird to have its inning. On the west bank of Otter Creek, a sparkling\r\ntributary of Beaver Creek, a well bored for salt fifty or more years ago\r\nyielded considerable oil. Instead of giving up the job, the owners\r\npumped the water and oil into a tank, over the side of which the lighter\r\nfluid was permitted to empty at its leisure. The salt-works came to a\r\nfull stop eventually and the well relapsed into “innocuous desuetude.”\r\nL. D. Carter, of Aurora, Ill., sojourning temporarily in Clinton for his\r\nhealth, saw the old well in 1864. He dipped a jugful of oil, took it to\r\nAurora, tested it on the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad, found it\r\na good lubricant and concluded to give the well a square trial. The\r\nrailroad-company agreed to buy the oil at a fair price. Carter pumped\r\nsix or eight barrels a day, hauled it in wagons over the hills to the\r\nCumberland River and saved money. He granted Mr. Prentice an option on\r\nthe property in 1877. The day the option expired J. O. Marshall bought\r\nthe well, farm and ten-thousand acres of leases conditionally, for a\r\nButler operator who “didn’t have the price,” and the deal fell through.\r\n\r\nThe well stood idle until 1892, when J. Hovey, an ex-broker from New\r\nYork and relative of a late Governor of Indiana, drilled a short\r\ndistance down the creek. The result was a strike which produced\r\ntwenty-four hundred barrels of dark, heavy, lubricating oil in fifty\r\ndays. It was shut down for want of tankage and means to transport the\r\nproduct to market. The Carter again yielded nicely, as did three more\r\nwells in this neighborhood. In 1895 the Standard Oil-Company was given a\r\nrefusal of the Hovey and surrounding interests, in order to test the\r\nterritory fully and lay a pipe-line to Glasgow or Louisville, should the\r\nproduction warrant the expenditure. Wells have been sunk east of the\r\nCarter nearly to Monticello, eighteen miles off, finding gas and\r\nindications of oil. Every true Clintonite is positive an ocean of\r\npetroleum underlies his particular neck of woods, impatient to be\r\nrelieved and burden landholders and operators alike with excessive\r\nwealth!\r\n\r\nA hard-headed youth, out walking with his best girl in the dog-days,\r\ntold her a fairy-story of the dire effects of ice-cream upon the\r\nfeminine constitution. “I knew a girl,” he declared, “who ate six plates\r\nof the dreadful stuff and died next day!” The shrewd damsel exclaimed\r\nrapturously: “Oh, wouldn’t it be sweet to die that way? Let us begin on\r\nsix plates now!” And wouldn’t it be nice to be loaded with riches, not\r\ngained by freezing out some other fellow, by looting a bank, by wedding\r\nan unloved bride, by grinding the poor, by manipulating stocks, by\r\ncornering grain or by practices that make the angels weep, but by\r\nbringing oil honestly from the bowels of the earth?\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1839 a salt-well in Lincoln county, eight miles from the\r\npretty town of Stanford, struck a vein of oil unexpectedly. The\r\ninflammable liquid gushed out with great force, took fire and burned\r\nfuriously for weeks. The owner was a grim joker in his way and he aptly\r\nremarked, upon viewing the conflagration: “I reckon I’ve got a little\r\nhell of my own!” Four more wells were drilled farther up the stream, two\r\ngetting a show of oil. One was plugged and the other, put down by the\r\nlate Marcus Hulings, the wealthy Pennsylvania operator, proved dry.\r\nSurface indications in many quarters gave rise to the belief that oil\r\nwould be found over a wide area, and in 1861 a well was bored at\r\nGlasgow, Barren county, one-hundred-and-ten miles below Louisville. It\r\nwas a success and a hundred have followed since, most of which are\r\nproducing moderately. Col. J. C. Adams, formerly of Tidioute, Pa., was\r\nthe principal operator for twenty years. A suburban town, happily termed\r\nOil City, is “flourishing like a green bay-horse.” The oil, dark and\r\nill-flavored, smelling worse than “the thousand odors of Cologne,” is\r\nrefined at Glasgow and Louisville. It can be deodorized and converted\r\ninto respectable kerosene. Sixteen miles south of Glasgow, on Green\r\nRiver, four shallow wells were bored thirty years ago, one flowing at\r\nthe rate of six-hundred barrels, so that Barren county is by no means\r\nbarren of interest to the oil-fraternity.\r\n\r\nAt Bowling Green a well was sunk two-hundred feet, a few gallons of\r\ngreen-oil bowling to the surface. Torpedoing was unknown, or the fate of\r\nmany Kentucky wells might have been reversed. John Jackson, of Mercer,\r\nPa., in 1866 drilled a well in Edmonson county, twenty-five miles\r\nnorth-west of Glasgow. The tools dropped through a crevice of the\r\nMammoth Cave, but neither eyeless fish nor slippery petroleum repaid the\r\noutlay of muscle and greenbacks. As if to add insult to injury, the well\r\nhatched a mammoth cave that buried the tools eight-hundred feet out of\r\nsight!\r\n\r\nLoyal to his early training and hungry for appetizing slapjacks, Jackson\r\nonce imported a sack of the flour from Louisville and asked the obliging\r\nlandlady of his boarding-house to have buckwheat-cakes for breakfast. He\r\nwas on hand in the morning, ready to do justice to the savory dish. The\r\n“cakes” were brought in smoking hot, baked into biscuit, heavy as lead\r\nand irredeemably unpalatable! The sack of flour went to fatten the\r\ndenizens of a neighbor’s pig-pen. Jackson was a pioneer in the Bradford\r\nregion, head of the firm of Jackson & Walker, clever and generous. The\r\ngrass and the flowers have grown on his grave for ten years, “the\r\ninsatiate archer” striking him down in the prime of vigorous manhood.\r\n\r\nSandy Valley, in the north-eastern section of the state, contributed its\r\nquota to the stock of Kentucky petroleum. From the first settlement of\r\nBoyd, Greenup, Carter, Johnson and Lawrence counties oil had been\r\ngathered for medical purposes by skimming it from the streams. About\r\n1855 Cummings & Dixon collected a half-dozen barrels from Paint Creek\r\nand treated it at their coal-oil refinery in Cincinnati, with results\r\nsimilar to those attained by Kier in Pittsburg. They continued to\r\ncollect oil from Paint Creek and Oil-Spring Fork until the war, at times\r\nsaving a hundred barrels a month. In 1861 they drilled a well\r\nthree-hundred feet on Mud Lick, a branch of Paint Creek, penetrating\r\nshale and sandstone and getting light shows of oil and gas. Surface-oil\r\nwas found on the Big-Sandy River, from its source to its mouth, and in\r\nconsiderable quantities on Paint, Blaine, Abbott, Middle, John’s and\r\nWolf Creeks. Large springs on Oil-Spring Fork, a feeder of Paint Creek,\r\nyielded a barrel a day. At the mouth of the Fork, in 1860, Lyon & Co.\r\ndrilled a well two-hundred feet, tapping three veins of heavy oil and\r\nretiring from the scene when “the late unpleasantness” began to shake up\r\nthe country. The same year a well was sunk one-hundred-and-seventy feet,\r\non the headwaters of Licking River, near the Great Burning Spring. Gas\r\nand oil burst out for days, but the low price of crude and the impending\r\nconflict prevented further work. What an innumerable array of nice\r\ncalculations this cruel war nipped in the bud!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTH-EASTERN KENTUCKY.]\r\n\r\nJ. Hinkley bored two-hundred feet in 1860, on Paint Creek, eight miles\r\nabove Paintville, meeting a six-inch crevice of heavy-oil, for which\r\nthere was no demand, and the capacity of the well was not tested.\r\nSalt-borers on a multitude of streams had much difficulty, fifty or\r\nsixty years ago, in getting rid of oil that persisted in coming to the\r\nsurface. These old wells have been filled with dirt, although in some\r\nthe oil works to the top and can be seen during the dry seasons. The\r\nPaint-Creek region had a severe attack of oil-fever in 1864-5. Hundreds\r\nof wells were drilled, boats were crowded, the hotels were thronged and\r\nthe one subject of conversation was “oil—oil—oil!” Various causes,\r\nespecially the extraordinary developments in Pennsylvania, compelled the\r\nplucky operators to abandon the district, notwithstanding encouraging\r\nsymptoms of an important field. Indeed, so common was it to find\r\npetroleum in ten or fifteen counties of Kentucky that land-owners ran a\r\nserious risk in selling their farms before boring them full of holes,\r\nlest they should unawares part with prospective oil-territory at\r\ncorn-fodder prices!\r\n\r\nTennessee did not draw a blank in the awards of petroleum-indications.\r\nAlong Spring Creek many wells, located in 1864-5 because of\r\n“surface-shows,” responded nobly, at a depth comparatively shallow, to\r\nthe magic touch of the drill. The product was lighter in color and\r\ngravity than the Kentucky brand. Twelve miles above Nashville, on the\r\nCumberland River, wells have been pumped at a profit. Around Gallatin,\r\nSumner county, decisive tests demonstrated the presence of petroleum in\r\nliberal measure. On Obey Creek, Fentress county, sufficient drilling has\r\nbeen done to justify the expectation of a rich district. Near\r\nChattanooga, on the southern border of the state, oil seepages are “too\r\nnumerous to mention.” The Lacy Well, eighteen miles south of the Beatty,\r\ndrilled in 1893, is good for thirty barrels every day in the week. The\r\noil is of superior quality, but the cost of marketing it is too great. A\r\ndozen wells are going down in Fentress, Overton, Scott and Putnam. Some\r\nfine day the tidal wave of development will sweep over the\r\nCumberland-River region, with improved appliances and complete\r\nequipment, and give the country a rattling “show for its white alley!”\r\nSurely all these spouting-wells, oil-springs and greasy oozings mean\r\nsomething. To quote a practical oilman, who knows both states from a to\r\nz: “Twenty counties in Kentucky and Tennessee are sweating petroleum!”\r\n\r\n              “Jes’ nail dat mink to de stable do’—\r\n              De niggahs’ll dance when de oil-wells flo!”\r\n\r\nPicking up a million acres of supposed oil-lands in the Blue-Grass and\r\nVolunteer States had its serio-comic features. The ignorant squatters in\r\nremote latitudes were suspicious of strangers, imagining them to be\r\nrevenue-officers on the trail of “moonshiners,” as makers of untaxed\r\nwhisky were generally called. More than one northern oilman narrowly\r\nescaped premature death on this conjecture. J. A. Satterfield, the\r\nsuccessful Butler operator, went to Kentucky in the winter of 1877 to\r\nsuperintend the leasing of territory for his firm, between which and the\r\nPrentice combination a lively scramble had been inaugurated. Somebody\r\nthought he must be a Government agent and passed the word to the lawless\r\nmountaineers. The second night of his stay a shower of bullets riddled\r\nthe window, two lodging in the bed in which Satterfield lay asleep!\r\nDaylight saw him galloping to the railroad at a pace eclipsing\r\nSheridan’s ride to Winchester, eager to “get back to God’s country.”\r\n“Once was enough for him” to figure as the target of shooters who seldom\r\nfailed to score “a hit, a palpable hit.” The grim archer didn’t miss him\r\nin 1894.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE DANGLING FROM A TREE.]\r\n\r\nArriving late one Saturday at Mt. Vernon, the county-seat of Rockcastle,\r\nthe colored waiter on Sunday morning inquired: “Hes yo done gone an’\r\nseen em?” Asking what he meant, he informed me that three men were\r\ndangling from a tree in the court-house yard, lynched by an infuriated\r\nmob during the night on suspicion of horse-stealing, “the unpardonable\r\nsin” in Kentucky. A party of citizens had started for the cabin of a\r\nnotorious outlaw, observed skulking homeward under cover of darkness,\r\nintending to string him up. The desperado was alert. He fired one shot,\r\nwhich killed a man and stampeded the assailants. They returned to the\r\nvillage, broke into the jail, dragged out three cowering wretches and\r\nhanged them in short metre! The bodies swung in the air all day, a\r\nsignificant warning to whoever might think of “walkin’ off with a hoss\r\ncritter.”\r\n\r\nOn that trip to Rockcastle county the train stopped at a wayside-station\r\nbearing the pretentious epithet of Chicago. A tall, gaunt, unshaven,\r\nuncombed man, with gnarled hands that appealed perpetually for soap and\r\nwater, high cheekbones, imperfect teeth and homespun-clothes of the\r\ntoughest description, stood on the platform in a pool of tobacco-juice.\r\nA rustic behind me stuck his head through the car-window and addressed\r\nthe hard-looking citizen as “Jedge.” Honors are easy in Kentucky, where\r\n“colonels,” “majors” and “judges” are “thick as leaves in Vallambrosa,”\r\nbut the title in this instance seemed too absurd to pass unheeded. When\r\nthe train started, in reply to my question whether the man on the\r\nplatform was a real judge, his friendly acquaintance took the pains to\r\nsay: “Wal, I can’t swar es he’s zackly, but las’ year he wuz jedge ov a\r\nchicken-fight down ter Si Mason’s an’ we calls ’im jedge ever sence!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MOUNTAIN VENDETTA.]\r\n\r\nKentucky vendettas have often figured in thrilling narratives. Business\r\ntook me to the upper end of Laurel county one week. Litigants, witnesses\r\nand hangers-on crowded the village, for a suit of unusual interest was\r\npending before the “’squar.” The principals were farmers from the hilly\r\nregion, whose fathers and grandfathers had been at loggerheads and\r\ntransmitted the quarrel to their posterity. Blood had been shed and\r\nhatred reigned supreme. The important case was about to begin. Two shots\r\nrang out so closely together as to be almost simultaneous, followed by a\r\nregular fusilade. Everybody ran into the street, where four men lay\r\ndead, a fifth was gasping his last breath and two others had ugly\r\nwounds. The tragedy was soon explained. The two parties to the suit had\r\nmet on their way to the justice’s house. Both were armed, both drew\r\npistols and both dropped in their tracks, one a corpse and the second\r\nready for the coroner in a few moments. Relatives and adherents\r\ncontinued the dreadful work and five lives paid the penalty of\r\nungovernable passion. The dead were wrapped in horse-blankets and carted\r\nhome. The case was not called. It had been “settled out of court.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “A BIGGER MAN ’N GEN’RAL GRANT.”]\r\n\r\nThe spectators of this dreadful scene manifested no uncommon concern.\r\n“It’s what might be expected,” echoed the local oracle; “when them\r\nmountain fellers gets whiskey inside them they don’t care fur nuthin’!”\r\nWithin an hour of the shooting a young man stopped me on the\r\nstreet-corner, where stood a wagon containing two bodies. “Kunnel,” he\r\nwent on to say, “I’ve h’ard es yo’s th’ man es got our farm fur oil. Dad\r\nan’ Cousin Bill’s ’n that ar wagon, an’ I want yo ter giv’ me a job\r\nhaulin’ wood agin yo starts work up our way.” He mounted the vehicle and\r\ndrove off with his ghastly freight without a quiver of emotion.\r\n\r\nAt Crab Orchard, one beautiful Sunday, the clerk chatted with me on the\r\nhotel-porch. A stalwart individual approached and my companion\r\nejaculated: “Thar’s a bigger man ’n Gen’ral Grant!” Next instant Col.\r\nKennedy was added to my list of Kentucky acquaintances. He was very\r\naffable, wished oil-operations in the neighborhood success and, with\r\ncharacteristic Southern hospitality, invited me to visit him. After he\r\nleft us the clerk, in answer to my desire to learn the basis of\r\nKennedy’s greatness, naively said: “Why, he’s killed eight men!”\r\n\r\n                “Some have greatness thrust upon them.”\r\n\r\nPolitics and religion were staple wares, the susceptible negroes\r\ninclining strongly to the latter. Their spasms of piety were extremely\r\ninconvenient at times. News of a “bush meetin’” would be circulated and\r\nswarms of darkeys would flock to the appointed place, taking provisions\r\nfor a protracted siege. No matter if it were the middle of harvest and\r\nrain threatening, they dropped everything and went to the meeting.\r\n“Doant ’magine dis niggah’s gwine ter lose his ’mo’tal soul fer no load\r\nuv cow-feed” was the conclusive rejoinder of a colored hand to his\r\nemployer, who besought him to stay and finish the haying.\r\n\r\n“In de Lawd’s gahden ebery cullud gentleman has got ter line his hoe.”\r\n\r\nRev. George O. Barnes, the gifted evangelist, who resigned a\r\nfive-thousand-dollar Presbyterian pastorate in Chicago to assist Moody,\r\nwas reared in Kentucky and lived near Stanford. He would traverse the\r\ncountry to hold revivals, staying three to six weeks in a place. His\r\npersonal magnetism, rare eloquence, apostolic zeal, fine education,\r\nintense fervor and catholic spirit made him a wonderful power. Converts\r\nhe numbered by thousands. He preferred Calvary to Sinai, the gentle\r\npleadings of infinite mercy to the harsh threats of endless torment. His\r\ndaughter Marie, with the voice of a Nilsson and the face of a Madonna,\r\naccompanied her father in his wanderings, singing gospel-hymns in a\r\nmanner that distanced Sankey and Philip Phillips. Her rendering of “Too\r\nLate,” “Almost Persuaded,” and “Only a Step to Jesus,” electrified and\r\nthrilled the auditors as no stage-song could have done. Raymon Moore’s\r\nhackneyed verses had not been written, yet the boys called Miss Barnes\r\n“Sweet Marie” and thronged to the penitent-bench. The evangelist and his\r\ndaughter tried to convert New York, but the Tammany stronghold refused\r\nto budge an inch. They invaded England and enrolled hosts of recruits\r\nfor Zion. The Prince of Wales is said to have attended one of their\r\nmeetings in the suburbs of London. Mr. Barnes finally proposed to cure\r\ndiseases by “anointing with oil and laying on of hands.” His pink\r\ncottage became a refuge for cranks and cripples and patients, until a\r\nmortgage on the premises was foreclosed and the queer aggregation\r\nscattered to the winds.\r\n\r\nAlbany, the county-seat of Clinton, experienced a Barnes revival of the\r\ntip-top order. Business with Major Brentz, the company’s attorney,\r\nlanded me in the cosy town on a bright March forenoon. Not a person was\r\nvisible. Stores were shut and comer-loungers absent. What could have\r\nhappened? Halting my team in front of the hotel, nobody appeared.\r\nRinging the quaint, old-fashioned bell attached to a post near the pump,\r\na lame, bent colored man shuffled out of the barn.\r\n\r\n“Pow’ful glad ter see yer, Massa,” he mumbled, “a’l put up de hosses.”\r\n\r\n“Where is the landlord?”\r\n\r\n“Done gone ter meetin’.”\r\n\r\n“Will dinner soon be ready?”\r\n\r\n“Soon the folkses gits back frum meetin’.”\r\n\r\n“All right, take good care of the horses and I’ll go over to the\r\ncourt-house.”\r\n\r\n“No good gwine dar, dey’s at the meetin’.”\r\n\r\nIt was true. Mr. Barnes was holding three services a day and the village\r\nemptied itself to get within sound of his voice. For five weeks this\r\nkept up. Lawyers quit their desks, merchants locked their stores, woman\r\ndeserted their houses and young and old thought only of the meetings.\r\nHardly a sinner was left to work upon, even the village-editor and the\r\ndisciples of Blackstone joining the hallelujah band! No wonder Satan’s\r\nimps wailed sadly:\r\n\r\n                  “And the blow almost killed father!”\r\n\r\nAn African congregation at Stanford had a preacher black as the ace of\r\nspades and wholly illiterate, whom many whites liked to hear. “Brudders\r\nan’ sistahs, niggahs and white folks,” he closed an exhortation by\r\nsaying, “dar’s no use ’temptin’ to sneak outen de wah ’tween de good\r\nLawd an’ de black debbil, ’cos dar’s on’y two armies in dis worl’ an’\r\nbofe am a-fitin’ eberlastingly! So ’list en de army ob light, ef yer\r\nwant ter gib ole Satan er black eye an’ not roast fureber an’ eber in de\r\nburnin’ lake whar watah-millions on ice am nebber se’ved for dinnah!”\r\nCould the most astute theological hair-splitter have presented the issue\r\nmore concisely and forcibly to the hearers of the sable Demosthenes?\r\n\r\nThe first and only circus that exhibited at Burksville produced an\r\nimmense sensation. It was “Bartholomew’s Equescurriculum,” with\r\ngymnastics and ring exercises to round out the bill. Barns, shops and\r\ntrees for miles bore gorgeous posters. Nast’s cartoons, which the most\r\nignorant voters could understand, did more to overthrow Boss Tweed than\r\nthe masterly editorials of the New-York _Times_. The flaming pictures\r\naroused the Cumberlanders, hundreds of whom could not read, to the\r\nhighest pitch of expectation. Monday was the day set for the show. On\r\nSaturday evening country-patrons began to camp in the woods outside the\r\nvillage. A couple from Overton county, Tennessee, and their four\r\nchildren rode twenty-eight miles on two mules, bringing food for three\r\ndays and lodging under the trees! A Burksville character of the stripe\r\nMiss Ophelia styled “shiftless” sold his cooking-stove for four dollars\r\nto get funds to attend! “Alf,” the ebony-hued choreman at Alexander\r\nCollege, who built my fires and blacked my shoes, was worked up to\r\nfever-heat. “Befo’ de Lawd,” he sobbed, “dis chile’s er gone coon, ’less\r\nyer len’ er helpin’ han’! Mah wife’s axed her mudder an’ sister ter th’\r\nci’cus an’ dar’s no munny ter take ’em an’ mah sister!” Giving him the\r\ncurrency for admission dried the mourner’s tears and “pushed them clouds\r\naway.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AFRICAN TALE OF WOE.]\r\n\r\nAt noon on Sunday the circus arrived by boat from Nashville. Service was\r\nin progress in one church, when an unearthly sound startled the\r\nworshippers. The wail of a lost soul could not be more alarming. Simon\r\nLegree, scared out of his boots by the mocking shriek of the wind\r\nblowing through the bottle-neck Cassy fixed in the garret knot-hole, had\r\nnumerous imitators. Again and again the ozone was rent and cracked and\r\nshivered. The congregation broke for the door, the minister jerking out\r\na sawed-off benediction and retreating with the rest. A half-mile down\r\nthe river a boat was rounding the bend. A steam-calliope, distracting,\r\ndiscordant and unlovely, belched forth a torrent of paralyzing notes.\r\nThe whole population was on the bank by the time the boat stopped. The\r\ncrowd watched the landing of the animals and belongings of the circus\r\nwith unflinching eagerness. Few of the surging mass had seen a theatre,\r\na circus, or a show of any sort except the Sunday-school Christmas\r\nperformance. They were bound to take in every detail and that Sunday was\r\nbadly splintered in the peaceful, orderly settlement.\r\n\r\nWith the earliest streak of dawn the excitement was renewed. Groups of\r\nadults and children, of all ages and sizes and complexions, were on hand\r\nto see the tents put up. By eleven o’clock the town was packed. A\r\nmerry-go-round, the first Burksville ever saw, raked in a bushel of\r\nnickels. The college domestics skipped, leaving the breakfast-dishes on\r\nthe table and the dinner to shift for itself. A party of friends went\r\nwith me to enjoy the fun. Beside a gap in the fence, to let wagons into\r\nthe field, sat “Alf,” the image of despair. Four weeping females—his\r\nwife, sister, mother-in-law and sister-in-law—crouched at his feet. As\r\nour party drew near he beckoned to us and unfolded his tale of woe. “Dem\r\nfool-wimmin,” he exclaimed bitterly, “hes done spended de free dollars\r\nyer guv me on de flyin’-hosses! Dey woodn’t stay off nohow an’ now dey\r\ncaint see de ci’cus! Oh, Lawd! Oh, Lawd!” The purchase of tickets poured\r\noil on the troubled waters. The Niobes wiped their eyes on their\r\njean-aprons and “Richard was himself again.” How the antics of the\r\nclowns and the tricks of the ponies pleased the motley assemblage! Buck\r\nFanshaw’s funeral did not arouse half the enthusiasm in Virginia City\r\nthe first circus did in Burksville.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WELCOME IN JUGS.]\r\n\r\nIt was necessary for me to visit Williamsburg, the county-seat of\r\nWhitley, to record a stack of leases. Somerset was then the nearest\r\nrailway-point and the trip of fifty miles on horseback required a guide.\r\nThe arrival of a Northerner raised a regular commotion in the well-nigh\r\ninaccessible settlement of four-hundred population. The landlord of the\r\npublic-house slaughtered his fattest chickens and set up a bed in the\r\nfront parlor to be sure of my comfort. The jailer’s fair daughter, who\r\nwas to be wedded that evening, kindly sent me an invitation to attend\r\nthe nuptials. By nine o’clock at night nearly every business-man and\r\nofficial in the place had called to bid me welcome. Before noon next day\r\nseventeen farmers, whose lands had been leased, rode into town to greet\r\nme and learn when drilling would likely begin. Each insisted upon my\r\nstaying with him a week, “or es much longer es yo kin,” and fourteen of\r\nthem brought gallon-jugs of apple-jack, their own straight goods, for my\r\nacceptance! Such a reception a king might envy, because it was entirely\r\nunselfish, hearty and spontaneous. Williamsburg has got out of\r\nswaddling-clothes, the railway putting it in touch with the balance of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nThirteen miles of land, in an unbroken line, on a meandering stream, had\r\nbeen tied-up, with the exception of a single farm. The owner was\r\nobdurate and refused to lease on any terms. Often lands not regarded\r\nfavorably as oil territory were taken to secure the right-of-way for\r\npipe-lines, as the leases conveyed this privilege. Driving past the\r\nstubborn farmer’s homestead one afternoon, he was chopping wood in the\r\nyard and strode to the gate to talk. His bright-eyed daughter of four\r\nsummers endeavored to clamber into the buggy. Handing the cute fairy in\r\ncoarse jeans a new silver-dollar, fresh from the Philadelphia mint, the\r\nfather caught sight of the shining coin.\r\n\r\n“Hev yo mo’ ov ’em ’ar dollars about yo?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Plenty more.”\r\n\r\n“Make out leases fur my three farms an’ me an’ the old woman’ll sign\r\n’em! I want three ov ’em kines, for they be th’ slickest Demmycratic\r\nmoney my eyes hes sot onto sence I fit with John Morgan!”\r\n\r\nThe documents were filled up, signed, sealed and delivered in fifteen\r\nminutes. The chain of leased lands along Fanny Creek was intact, with\r\nthe “missing link” missing at last.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of these dwellers in the wilderness was equaled only by\r\ntheir apathy to the world beyond and around them. Parents loved their\r\nchildren and husbands loved their wives in a quiet, unobtrusive fashion.\r\n“She wuz a hard-workin’ woman,” moaned a middle-aged widower in Fentress\r\ncounty, telling me of his deceased spouse, “an’ she allers wore a frock\r\nfive year, an’ she bed ’leven chil’ren, an’ she died right in\r\ncorn-shuckin’!” He was not stony-hearted, but twenty-five years of\r\nmarried companionship meant to him just so many days’ work, so many\r\ncheap frocks, child-bearing, corn-cake and bacon always ready on time.\r\nAmong these people woman was a drudge, who knew nothing of the higher\r\nrelations of life. Children were huddled into the hills to track game,\r\nto follow the plough or to drop corn over many a weary acre. Reading and\r\nwriting were unknown accomplishments. Jackson, “the great tradition of\r\nthe uninformed American mind,” and Lincoln, whose name the tumult of a\r\nmighty struggle had rendered familiar, were the only Presidents they had\r\never heard of. “Where ignorance is bliss ’tis folly to be wise” may be a\r\nsound poetical sentiment, but it was decidedly overdone in South-eastern\r\nKentucky and North-eastern Tennessee so recently as the year of the\r\nPhiladelphia Centennial.\r\n\r\nOpposite the Hovey and Carter wells in Clinton county lives a portly\r\nfarmer who “is a good man and weighs two-hundred-and-fifty pounds.” He\r\nis known far and wide as “Uncle John” and his wife, a pleasant-faced\r\nlittle matron, is affectionately called “Aunt Rachel.” A log-church a\r\nmile from “Uncle John’s” is situated on a pretty hill. There the young\r\nfolks are married, the children are baptized and the dead are buried.\r\nThe “June meetin’,” when services are held for a week, is the grand\r\nincident of the year to the people for a score of miles. In December of\r\n1893 Dr. Phillips, of Monticello, drove me to the wells. We stopped at\r\n“Uncle John’s.” As we neared the house a dog barked and the hospitable\r\nfarmer came out to meet us. Behind him walked a man who greeted the\r\nDoctor cordially. He glanced at me, recognition was mutual and we\r\nclasped hands warmly. He was Alfred Murray, formerly connected with the\r\nPennsylvania-Consolidated Land-and-Petroleum-Company in Butler and at\r\nBradford. Fourteen years had glided away since we met and there were\r\nmany questions to ask and answer. He had been in the neighborhood a\r\ntwelvemonth, keeping tab on oil movements and indications, hoping,\r\nlonging and praying for the speedy advent of the petroleum-millenium. We\r\npumped the Hovey Well one hour, rambled over the hills and talked until\r\nmidnight about persons and things in Pennsylvania. Meeting in so dreary\r\na place, under such circumstances, was as thorough a surprise as\r\nStanley’s discovery of Livingstone in Darkest Africa. During our\r\nconversation regarding the roughest portion of the county, bleak,\r\nsterile and altogether repellant, selected by a hermit as his lonely\r\nretreat, my friend remarked: “I have heard that the poor devil was\r\ntroubled with remorse and, as a sort of penance, vowed to live as near\r\nSheol as possible until he died!”\r\n\r\nThe stage that bore me from Monticello to Point Burnside on my homeward\r\njourney stopped half-way to take up a countryman and an aged woman. Room\r\nwas found inside for the latter, a stout, motherly old creature, into\r\nwhose beaming face it did jaded mortals good to look. She said “howdy”\r\nto the three passengers, a local trader, a farmer’s young wife and\r\nmyself, sat down solidly and fixed her gaze upon me intently. It was\r\nevident the dear soul was fairly bursting with impatience to find out\r\nabout the stranger. Not a word was spoken until she could restrain her\r\ninquisitive impulse no longer.\r\n\r\n“Yo don’t liv’ eroun’ these air parts?” she interrogated.\r\n\r\n“No, madam, my home is in Pennsylvania.”\r\n\r\n“Land sakes! Be yo one ov ’em air ile-fellers?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Wal, I be orful glad ter see yo!” and she stretched out her hand and\r\nshook mine vigorously. “Hope yo’re right peart, but yo’ be a long way\r\nfrom home! Did yo see ’em wells over thar by Aunt Rachel’s?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I saw the wells and stayed at Aunt Rachel’s all night.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “I BE ORFUL GLAD TER SEE YO!”]\r\n\r\n“I ain’t seed Aunt Rachel for nigh a year an’ a half. My old man bed\r\nroomatiz and we couldn’t get ter meetin’ this summer. He sez thar’s ile\r\nonto our farm. I be seventy-four an’ him on the ruf be my son’n-law. Yo\r\nsee he married, Jess did, my darter Sally an’ tha moved ter a place tha\r\ncall Kansas. Tha’s bin thar seventeen year an’ hes six chil’ren. Jess he\r\ncum back las’ week ter see his fokeses an’ he be takin’ me ter Kansas\r\nter see Sally an’ the babies. I never seed ’em things Jess calls cyars,\r\nan’ he sez tha ain’t drord by no hoss nuther! I wuz bo’n eight mile down\r\nhyar an’ never wuz from home more’n eighteen mile, when we goes ter June\r\nmeetin’. But I be ter Monticeller six times.”\r\n\r\nTruly this was a natural specimen, bubbling over with kindness,\r\nunspoiled by fashion and envy and frivolity and superficial pretense.\r\nHere was the counterpart of Cowper’s humble heroine, who “knew, and knew\r\nno more, her Bible true.” The wheezy stage was brighter for her\r\npresence. She told of her family, her cows, her pigs, her spinning and\r\nher neighbors. She lived four miles from the Cumberland River, yet never\r\nwent to see a steamboat! When we alighted at the Burnside station and\r\nthe train dashed up she looked sorely perplexed. “Jess” helped her up\r\nthe steps and the “cyars” started. The whistle screeched, daylight\r\nvanished and the train had entered the tunnel below the depot. A fearful\r\nscream pierced the ears of the passengers. The good woman seventy-four\r\nyears old, who “never seed ’em things” before, was terribly frightened.\r\nWe tried to reassure her, but she begged to be let off. How “Jess”\r\nmanaged to get her to Kansas safely may be imagined. But what a story\r\nshe would have to tell about the “cyars” and “Sally an’ the babies” when\r\nshe returned to her quiet home after such a trip! Bless her old heart!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “EF YO KNOW’D COUSIN JIM.”]\r\n\r\nAlthough the broad hills and sweeping streams which grouped many sweet\r\npanoramas might be dull and meaningless to the average Kentuckian of\r\nformer days, through some brains glowing visions flitted. Two miles\r\nsouth of Columbia, Adair county, on the road to Burksville, a heap of\r\nstones and pieces of rotting timber may still be seen. Fifty-five years\r\nago the man who owned the farm constructed a huge wheel, loaded with\r\nrocks of different weights on its strong arms. Neighbors jeered and\r\nridiculed, just as scoffers laughed at Noah’s ark and thought it\r\nwouldn’t be much of a shower anyway. The hour to start the wheel arrived\r\nand its builder stood by. A rock on an arm of the structure slipped off\r\nand struck him a fatal blow, felling him lifeless to the earth! He was a\r\nvictim of the craze to solve the problem of Perpetual Motion. Who can\r\ntell what dreams and plans and fancies and struggles beset this obscure\r\ngenius, cut off at the moment he anticipated a triumph? The wheel was\r\npermitted to crumble and decay, no human hand touching it more. The heap\r\nof stones is a pathetic memento of a sad tragedy. Not far from the spot\r\nMark Twain was born and John Fitch whittled out the rough model of the\r\nfirst steamboat.\r\n\r\nRiding in Scott county, Tennessee, at full gallop on a rainy afternoon,\r\na cadaverous man emerged from a miserable hut and hailed me. The\r\ndialogue was not prolonged unduly.\r\n\r\n“Gen’ral,” he queried, “air yo th’ oilman frum Pennsylvany?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, what can I do for you?”\r\n\r\n“I jes’ wanted ter ax ef yo know’d my cousin Jim!”\r\n\r\n“Who is your cousin Jim?”\r\n\r\n“Law, Jim Sickles! I tho’t ez how ev’rybody know’d Jim! He went up No’th\r\narter th’ wah an’ ain’t cum back yit. Ef yo see ’im tell ’im yo seed\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nA promise to look out for “Jim” satisfied the verdant backwoodsman, who\r\nprobably had never been ten miles from his shanty and deemed “up No’th”\r\na place about the size of a Tennessee hunting-ground!\r\n\r\nThe South-Penn and the Forest Oil-Companies, branches of the Standard,\r\nhave drilled considerably in Kentucky and Tennessee, sometimes finding\r\noil in regular strata and occasionally encountering irregular\r\nformations. More operating is required to determine precisely what place\r\nto assign these pebbles on the beach as sources of oil-production.\r\n\r\n          Fair women, pure Bourbon and men extra plucky,\r\n          No wonder blue-grass folks esteem themselves lucky—\r\n          But wait till the oil-boom gets down to Kentucky!\r\n\r\n          Let Fortune assume forms and fancies Protean,\r\n          No matter for that, there will rise a loud pæan\r\n          So long as oil gladdens the proud Tennesseean!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Map\r\n  of\r\n  VENANGO COUNTY\r\n  Pennsylvania\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EARLY OPERATORS ON OIL CREEK.\r\n  WM.

Kier fired-up his miniature refinery at Pittsburg. North and south,\r\neast and west the presence of the greasy staple was manifested\r\npositively and extensively. The hump of a dromedary, the kick of a mule\r\nor the ruby blossom on a toper’s nose could not be more apparent. It\r\nbubbled in fountains, floated on rivulets, escaped from crevices,\r\ncollected in pools, blazed on the plains, gurgled down the mountains,\r\nclogged the ozone with vapor, smelled and sputtered, trickled and seeped\r\nfor thousands of years in vain attempts to divert attention towards the\r\n_source_ of this prodigal display. Mankind accepted it as a liniment and\r\nlubricant, gulped it down, rubbed it in, smeared it on and never thought\r\nof seeking whence it came or how much of it might be procured. Even\r\nafter salt-wells had produced the stuff none stopped to reflect that the\r\ngolden grease must be imprisoned far beneath the earth’s surface, only\r\nawaiting release to bless the dullards callous to the strongest hints\r\nrespecting its headquarters. The dunce who heard Sydney Smith’s\r\nside-splitting story and sat as solemn as the sphinx, because he\r\ncouldn’t see any point until the next day and then got it heels over\r\nhead, was less obtuse. Puck was right in his little pleasantry: “What\r\nfools these mortals be!”\r\n\r\nDr. Abraham Gesner obtained oil from coal in 1846 and in 1854 patented\r\nan illuminator styled “Kerosene,” which the North American Kerosene\r\nGaslight Company of New York manufactured at its works on Long Island.\r\nThe excellence of the new light—the smoke and odor were eliminated\r\ngradually—caused a brisk demand that froze the marrow of the animal-oil\r\nindustry. Capitalists invested largely in Virginia, Kentucky and\r\nMissouri coal-lands, saving the expense of transporting the “raw\r\nmaterial” by erecting oil-works at the mines. Exactly in the ratio that\r\nmining coal was cheaper than catching whales mineral-oil had the\r\nadvantage in competing for a market. Realizing this, men owning fish-oil\r\nworks preserved them from extinction by manufacturing the\r\nmineral-product Young and Gesner had introduced. Thus Samuel Downer’s\r\nhalf-million-dollar works near Boston and colossal plant at Portland\r\nwere utilized. Downer had expanded ideas and remarked with\r\ncharacteristic emphasis, in reply to a friend who criticised him for the\r\nrisk he ran in putting up an enormous refinery at Corry, as the\r\noil-production might exhaust: “The Almighty never does a picayune\r\nbusiness!” Fifty or sixty of these works were turning out oil from\r\nbituminous shales in 1859, when the influx of petroleum compelled their\r\nconversion into refineries to avert overwhelming loss. Maine had one,\r\nMassachusetts five, New York five, Pennsylvania eight, Ohio twenty-five,\r\nKentucky six, Virginia eight, Missouri one and one was starting in\r\nMcKean county, near Kinzua village. The Carbon Oil-Company, 184 Water\r\nstreet, New York City, was the chief dealer in the illuminant. The\r\nentire petroleum-traffic in 1858 was barely eleven-hundred barrels, most\r\nof it obtained from Tarentum. A shipment of twelve barrels to New York\r\nin November, 1857, may be considered the beginning of the history of\r\npetroleum as an illuminator. How the baby has grown!\r\n\r\nThe price of “kerosene” or “carbon-oil,” always high, advanced to two\r\ndollars a gallon! Nowadays people grudge ten cents a gallon for oil\r\nvastly clearer, purer, better and safer! One good result of the high\r\nprices was an exhaustive scrutiny by the foremost scientific authorities\r\ninto all the varieties of coal and bitumen, out of which comparisons\r\nwith petroleum developed incidentally. Belief in its identity with\r\ncoal-oil prompted the investigations which finally determined the\r\neconomic value of petroleum. Professor B. Silliman, Jun., Professor of\r\nChemistry in Yale College, in the spring of 1855 concluded a thorough\r\nanalysis of petroleum from a “spring” on Oil Creek, nearly two miles\r\nsouth of Titusville, where traces of pits cribbed with rough timber\r\nstill remained and the sticky fluid had been skimmed for two\r\ngenerations. In the course of his report Professor Silliman observed:\r\n\r\n“It is understood and represented that this product exists in great\r\nabundance on the property; that it can be gathered wherever a well is\r\nsunk, over a great number of acres, and that it is unfailing in its\r\nyield from year to year. The question naturally arises, Of what value is\r\nit in the arts and for what uses can it be employed? * * * The Crude-Oil\r\nwas tried as a means of illumination. For this purpose a weighed\r\nquantity was decomposed by passing it through a wrought-iron retort\r\nfilled with carbon and ignited to redness. It produced nearly pure\r\ncarburetted hydrogen gas, the most highly illuminating of all carbon\r\ngases. In fact, the oil may be regarded as chemically identical with\r\nilluminating gas in a liquid form. It burned with an intense flame. * *\r\n* The light from the rectified Naphtha is pure and white, without odor,\r\nand the rate of consumption less than half that of Camphene or\r\nRosin-Oil. * * * Compared with Gas, the Rock-Oil gave more light than\r\nany burner, except the costly Argand, consuming two feet of gas per\r\nhour. These photometric experiments have given the Oil a much higher\r\nvalue as an illuminator than I had dared to hope. * * * As this oil does\r\nnot gum or become acid or rancid by exposure, it possesses in that, as\r\nwell as in its wonderful resistance to extreme cold, important qualities\r\nfor a lubricator. * * * It is worthy of note that my experiments prove\r\nthat nearly the _whole_ of the raw product may be manufactured without\r\nwaste, solely by one of the most simple of all chemical processes.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these researches, which he spent five months in\r\nprosecuting, the idea of artesian-boring for petroleum—naturally\r\nsuggested by the oil in the salines of the Muskingum, Kanawha,\r\nCumberland and Allegheny—never occurred to the learned Professor of\r\nChemistry in Yale! If he had been the Yale football, with Hickok\r\nswatting it five-hundred pounds to the square inch, the idea might have\r\nbeen pummeled into the man of crucibles and pigments! Once more was\r\nnature frustrated in the endeavor to “bring out” a favorite child. The\r\nfaithful dog that attempted to drag a fat man by the seat of his pants\r\nto the rescue of a drowning master, or Diogenes in his protracted quest\r\nfor an honest Athenian, had an easier task. The “spring” which furnished\r\nthe material for Silliman’s experiments was on the Willard farm, part of\r\nthe lands of Brewer, Watson & Co.—Ebenezer Brewer and James Rynd,\r\nPittsburg, Jonathan Watson, Rexford Pierce and Elijah Newberry,\r\nTitusville—extensive lumbermen on Oil Creek. They ran a sawmill on an\r\nisland near the east bank of the creek, at a bend in the stream, a few\r\nrods south of the boundary-line between Venango and Crawford counties.\r\nClose to the mill was the rusty-looking “spring” from which the oil to\r\nburn in rude lamps, smoky and chimneyless, and to lubricate the circular\r\nsaw was derived. The following document explains the first action\r\nretarding the care and development of the “spring.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed this fourth day of July, A.D. 1853, with J. D. Angier, of\r\nCherrytree Township, in the County of Venango, Pa., that he shall repair\r\nup and keep in order the old oil-spring on land in said Cherrytree\r\ntownship, or dig and make new springs, and the expenses to be deducted\r\nout of the proceeds of the oil and the balance, if any, to be equally\r\ndivided, the one-half to J. D. Angier and the other half to Brewer,\r\nWatson & Co., for the full term of five years from this date, if\r\nprofitable.”\r\n\r\nAll parties signed this agreement, pursuant to which Angier, for many\r\nyears a resident of Titusville, dug trenches centering in a basin from\r\nwhich a pump connected with the sawmill raised the water into shallow\r\ntroughs that sloped to the ground. Small skimmers, nicely adjusted to\r\nskim the oil, collected three or four gallons a day, but the experiment\r\ndid not pay and it was dropped. In the summer of 1854 Dr. F. B. Brewer,\r\nson of the senior member of the firm owning the mill and “spring,”\r\nvisited relatives at Hanover, New Hampshire, carrying with him a bottle\r\nof the oil as a gift to Professor Crosby, of Dartmouth College. Shortly\r\nafter George H. Bissell, a graduate of the college, practicing law in\r\nNew York with Jonathan G. Eveleth, while on a visit to Hanover called to\r\nsee Professor Crosby, who showed him the bottle of petroleum. Crosby’s\r\nson induced Bissell to pay the expenses of a trip to inspect the\r\n“spring” and to agree, in case of a satisfactory report, to organize a\r\ncompany with a capital of a quarter-million dollars to purchase lands\r\nand erect such machinery as might be required to collect all the oil in\r\nthe vicinity.\r\n\r\n        “Great minds never limit their designs in their plans.”\r\n\r\nComplications and misunderstandings retarded matters. Everything was\r\nadjusted at last. Brewer, Watson & Co. conveyed in fee-simple to George\r\nH. Bissell and Jonathan G. Eveleth one-hundred-and-five acres of land in\r\nCherrytree township, embracing the island at the junction of Pine Creek\r\nand Oil Creek, on which the mill of the firm and the Angier ditches were\r\nsituated. The deed was formally executed on January first, 1855. Eveleth\r\nand Bissell gave their own notes for the purchase-money—five-thousand\r\ndollars—less five-hundred dollars paid in cash. The consideration\r\nmentioned in the deed was twenty-five-thousand dollars, five times the\r\nactual sum, in order not to appear such a small fraction of the total\r\ncapital—two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand dollars—as to injure the sale of\r\nstock. On December thirtieth, 1854, articles of incorporation of The\r\nPennsylvania Rock-Oil-Company were filed in New York and Albany. The\r\nstock did not sell, owing to the prostration of the money-market and the\r\nfact that the company had been organized in New York, by the laws of\r\nwhich state each shareholder in a joint-stock company was liable for its\r\ndebts to the amount of the par value of the stock he held. New-Haven\r\nparties agreed to subscribe for large blocks of stock if the company\r\nwere reorganized under the laws of Connecticut. A new company was formed\r\nwith a nominal capital of three-hundred-thousand dollars, to take the\r\nname and property of the one to be dissolved and levy an assessment to\r\ndevelop the island “by trenching” on a wholesale plan.\r\n\r\nEveleth & Bissell retained a controlling interest and Ashael Pierpont,\r\nJames M. Townsend and William A. Ives were three of the New-Haven\r\nstockholders. Bissell visited Titusville to complete the transfer. On\r\nJanuary sixteenth he and his partner had given a deed, which was not\r\nrecorded, to the trustees of the original company. At Titusville he\r\nlearned that lands of corporations organized outside of Pennsylvania\r\nwould be forfeited to the state. The new company was notified of this\r\nlaw and to avoid trouble, on September twentieth, 1855, Eveleth &\r\nBissell executed a deed to Pierpont and Ives, who gave a bond for the\r\nvalue of the property and leased it for ninety-nine years to a company\r\nformed two days before under certain articles of association. It really\r\nseemed that something definite would be done. The first oil-company in\r\nthe history of nations had been organized. Pierpont, an eminent\r\nmechanic, was sent to examine the “spring,” with a view to improve\r\nAngier’s machinery. Silliman’s reports had a stimulating effect and the\r\nProfessor was president of the company. But the monkey-and-parrot time\r\nwas renewed. Dissensions broke out, Angier was fired and the enterprise\r\nlooked to be “as dead as Julius Cæsar,” ready to bury “a hundred fathoms\r\ndeep.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAC-SIMILE OF LABEL ON KIER’S PETROLEUM.]\r\n\r\nOne scorching day in the summer of 1856 Mr. Bissell, standing beneath\r\nthe awning of a Broadway drug-store for a moment’s shade, noticed a\r\nbottle of Kier’s Petroleum and a queer show-bill, or label, in the\r\nwindow. It struck him as rather odd that a four-hundred-dollar bill—such\r\nit appeared—should be displayed in that manner. A second glance proved\r\nthat it was an advertisement of a substance that concerned him deeply.\r\nHe stepped inside and requested permission to scan the label. The\r\ndruggist told him to “take it along.” For an instant he gazed at the\r\nderricks and the figures—four-hundred feet! A thought flashed upon\r\nhim—bore artesian wells for oil! Artesian wells! Artesian wells! rang in\r\nhis ears like the Trinity chimes down the street, the bells of London\r\ntelling “Dick” Whittington to return or the pibroch of the Highlanders\r\nat Lucknow. The idea that meant so much was born at last. Patient nature\r\nmust have felt in the mood to turn somersaults, blow a tin-horn and\r\ndance the fandango. It was a simple thought—merely to bore a hole in the\r\nrock—with no frills and furbelows and fustian, but pregnant with\r\nastounding consequences. It has added untold millions to the wealth of\r\nthe country and conferred incalculable benefits upon humanity. To-day\r\nrefined petroleum lights more dwellings in America, Europe, Asia, Africa\r\nand Australia than all other agencies combined.\r\n\r\nTo put the idea to the test was the next wrinkle. Mr. Eveleth agreed\r\nwith Bissell’s theory. Their first impulse was to bore a well\r\nthemselves. Reflection cooled their ardor, as this course would involve\r\nthe loss of their practice for an uncertainty. Mr. Havens, a Wall-street\r\nbroker, whom they consulted, offered them five-hundred dollars for a\r\nlease from the Pennsylvania Rock-Oil Company. A contract with Havens, by\r\nthe terms of which he was to pay “twelve cents a gallon for all oil\r\nraised for fifteen years,” financial reverses prevented his carrying\r\nout. The idea of artesian boring was too fascinating to lie dormant. Mr.\r\nTownsend, president of the company, Silliman having resigned, employed\r\nEdwin L. Drake, to whom in the darker days of its existence he had sold\r\ntwo-hundred-dollars’ worth of his own stock, to visit the property and\r\nreport his impressions. Mrs. Brewer and Mrs. Rynd had not joined in the\r\npower-of-attorney by which the agent conveyed the Brewer-Watson lands to\r\nthe company, hence they would be entitled to dower in case the husbands\r\ndied. Drake was instructed to return by way of Pittsburg and procure\r\ntheir signatures. Illness had forced him to quit work—he was conductor\r\non the New-York & New-Haven Railroad—for some months and the opportunity\r\nfor change of air and scene was embraced gladly. Shrewd, far-seeing\r\nTownsend, who still lives in New Haven and has been credited with “the\r\ndiscovery” of petroleum, addressed legal documents and letters to\r\n“Colonel” Drake, no doubt supposing this would enhance the importance of\r\nhis representative in the eyes of the Oil-Creek backwoodsmen. The\r\nmilitary title stuck to the diffident civilian whose name is interwoven\r\nwith the great events of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JONATHAN TITUS.]\r\n\r\nStopping on his way from New Haven to view the salt-wells at Syracuse,\r\nabout the middle of December, 1857, Colonel Drake was trundled into\r\nTitusville—named from Jonathan Titus—on the mail-wagon from Erie. The\r\nvillagers received him cordially. He lodged at the American Hotel, the\r\nhome-like inn “Billy” Robinson, the first boniface, and Major Mills,\r\nking of landlords, rendered famous by their bountiful hospitality. The\r\nold caravansary was torn down in 1880 to furnish a site for the Oil\r\nExchange. Drake stayed a few days to transact legal business, to examine\r\nthe lands and the indications of oil and to become familiar with the\r\ngeneral details. Proceeding to Pittsburg, he visited the salt-wells at\r\nTarentum, the picture of which on Kier’s label suggested boring for oil,\r\nand hastened back to Connecticut to conclude a scheme of operating the\r\nproperty. On December thirtieth the three New-Haven directors executed a\r\nlease to Edwin E. Bowditch and Edwin L. Drake, who were to pay the\r\nPennsylvania Rock-Oil-Company “five-and-a-half cents a gallon for the\r\noil raised for fifteen years.” Eight days later, at the annual meeting\r\nof the directors, the lease was ratified, George H. Bissell and Jonathan\r\nWatson, representing two-thirds of the stock, protesting. Thereupon the\r\nconsideration was placed at “one-eighth of all oil, salt or paint\r\nproduced.” The lease was sent to Franklin and recorded in Deed Book P,\r\npage 357. A supplemental lease, extending the time to forty-five years\r\non the conditions of the grant to Havens, was recorded, and on March\r\ntwenty-third, 1858, the Seneca Oil-Company was organized, with Colonel\r\nDrake as president and owner of one-fortieth of the “stock.” No stock\r\nwas issued, for the company was in reality a partnership working under\r\nthe laws governing joint-stock associations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST DRAKE WELL, ITS DRILLERS AND ITS COMPLETE RIG.]\r\n\r\nProvided with a fund of one-thousand dollars as a starter, Drake was\r\nengaged at one-thousand dollars a year to begin operations. Early in\r\nMay, 1858, he and his family arrived in Titusville and were quartered at\r\nthe American Hotel, which boarded the Colonel, Mrs. Drake, two children\r\nand a horse for six-dollars-and-a-half per week! Money was scarce,\r\nprovisions were cheap and the quiet village put on no extravagant airs.\r\nNot a pick or shovel was to be had in any store short of Meadville,\r\nwhither Drake was obliged to send for these useful tools! Behold, then,\r\n“the man who was to revolutionize the light of the world,” his mind full\r\nof a grand purpose and his pockets full of cash, snugly ensconced in the\r\ncomfortable hostelry. Surely the curtain would soon rise and the drama\r\nof “A Petroleum-Hunt” proceed without further vexatious delays.\r\n\r\nDrake’s first step was to repair and start up Angier’s system of\r\ntrenches, troughs and skimmers. By the end of June he had dug a shallow\r\nwell on the island and was saving ten gallons of oil a day. He found it\r\ndifficult to get a practical “borer” to sink an artesian-well. In August\r\nhe shipped two barrels of oil to New Haven and bargained for a\r\nsteam-engine to furnish power for drilling. The engine was not furnished\r\nas agreed, the “borer” Dr. Brewer hired at Pittsburg had another\r\ncontract and operations were suspended for the winter. In February,\r\n1859, Drake went to Tarentum and engaged a driller to come in March. The\r\ndriller failed to materialize and Drake drove to Tarentum in a sleigh to\r\nlasso another. F. N. Humes, who was cleaning out salt-wells for\r\nPeterson, informed him that the tools were made by William A. Smith,\r\nwhom he might be able to secure for the job. Smith accepted the offer to\r\nmanufacture tools and bore the well. Kim Hibbard, favorably known in\r\nFranklin, was dispatched with his team, when the tools were completed,\r\nfor Smith, his two sons and the outfit. On May twentieth the men and\r\ntools were at the spot selected for the hole. A “pump-house” had been\r\nframed and a derrick built. A room for “boarding the hands” almost\r\njoined the rig and the sawmill. The accompanying illustration shows the\r\nwell as it was at first, with the original derrick enclosed to the top,\r\nthe “grasshopper walking-beam,” the “boarding-house” and part of the\r\nmill-shed. “Uncle Billy” Smith is seated on a wheelbarrow in the\r\nforeground. His sons, James and William, are standing on either side of\r\nthe “pump-house” entrance. Back of James his two young sisters are\r\nsitting on a board. Elbridge Lock stands to the right of the Smiths.\r\n“Uncle Billy’s” brother is leaning on a plank at the corner of the\r\nderrick and his wife may be discerned in the doorway of the\r\n“boarding-house.” This interesting and historic picture has never been\r\nprinted until now. The one with which the world is acquainted depicts\r\nthe _second_ rig, with Peter Wilson, a Titusville druggist, facing\r\nDrake. In like manner, the portrait of Colonel Drake in this volume is\r\nfrom the first photograph for which he ever sat. The well and the\r\nportrait are the work of John A. Mather, the veteran artist and Drake’s\r\nbosom-friend, who ought to receive a pension and no end of gratitude for\r\npreserving “counterfeit presentments” of a host of petroleum-scenes and\r\npersonages that have passed from mortal sight.\r\n\r\nDelays and tribulations had not retreated from the field. In\r\nartesian-boring it is necessary to drill in rock. Mrs. Glasse’s old-time\r\ncook-book gained celebrity by starting a recipe for rabbit-pie: “First\r\ncatch your hare.” The principle applies to artesian-drilling: “First\r\ncatch your rock.” The ordinary rule was to dig a pit or well-hole to the\r\nrock and crib it with timber. The Smiths dug a few feet, but the hole\r\nfilled with water and caved-in persistently. It was a fight-to-a-finish\r\nbetween three men and what Stow of Girard—he was Barnum’s hot-stuff\r\nadvance agent—wittily termed “the cussedness of inanimate things.” The\r\nlatter won and a council of war was summoned, at which Drake recommended\r\ndriving an iron-tube through the clay and quicksand to the rock. This\r\nwas effectual. Colonel Drake should have patented the process, which was\r\nhis exclusive device and decidedly valuable. The pipe was driven\r\nthirty-six feet to hard-pan and the drill started on August fourteenth.\r\nThe workmen averaged three feet a day, resting at night and on Sundays.\r\nIndications of oil were met as the tools pierced the rock. Everybody\r\nfigured that the well would be down to the Tarentum level in time to\r\ncelebrate Christmas. The company, tired of repeated postponements, did\r\nnot deluge Drake with money. Losing speculations and sickness had\r\ndrained his own meagre savings. R. D. Fletcher, the well-known\r\nTitusville merchant, and Peter Wilson endorsed his paper for six-hundred\r\ndollars to tide over the crisis. The tools pursued the downward road\r\nwith the eagerness of a sinner headed for perdition, while expectation\r\nstood on tiptoe to watch the progress of events.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday afternoon, August twenty-eighth, 1859, the well had reached\r\nthe depth of sixty-nine feet, in a coarse sand. Smith and his sons\r\nconcluded to “lay off” until Monday morning. As they were about to quit\r\nthe drill dropped six inches into a crevice such as was common in\r\nsalt-wells. Nothing was thought of this circumstance, the tools were\r\ndrawn out and all hands adjourned to Titusville. Mr. Smith went to the\r\nwell on Sunday afternoon to see if it had moved away or been purloined\r\nduring the night. Peering into the hole he saw fluid within eight or ten\r\nfeet. A piece of tin-spouting was lying outside. He plugged one end of\r\nthe spout, let it down by a string and pulled it up. Muddy water? No! It\r\nwas filled with PETROLEUM!\r\n\r\n“The fisherman, unassisted by destiny, could not catch fish in the\r\nTigris.”\r\n\r\nThat was the proudest hour in “Uncle Billy” Smith’s forty-seven years’\r\npilgrimage. Not daring to leave the spot, he ran the spout again and\r\nagain, each time bringing it to the surface full of oil. A straggler out\r\nfor a stroll approached, heard the story, sniffed the oil and bore the\r\ntidings to the village. Darkness was setting in, but the Smith boys\r\nsprinted to the scene. When Colonel Drake came down, bright and early\r\nnext morning, they and their father were guarding three barrels of the\r\nprecious liquid. The pumping apparatus was adjusted and by noon the well\r\ncommenced producing at the rate of twenty barrels a day! The problem of\r\nthe ages was solved, the agony ended and petroleum fairly launched upon\r\nits astonishing career.\r\n\r\nThe news flew like a Dakota cyclone. Villagers and country-folk flocked\r\nto the wonderful well. Smith wrote to Peterson, his former employer:\r\n“Come quick, there’s oceans of oil!” Jonathan Watson jumped on a horse\r\nand galloped down the creek to lease the McClintock farm, where\r\nNathanael Cary dipped oil and a timbered crib had been constructed.\r\nHenry Potter, still a citizen of Titusville, tied up the lands for miles\r\nalong the stream, hoping to interest New York capital. William Barnsdall\r\nsecured the farm north of the Willard. George H. Bissell, who had\r\narranged to be posted by telegraph, bought all the Pennsylvania Rock-Oil\r\nstock he could find and in four days was at the well. He leased farm\r\nafter farm on Oil Creek and the Allegheny River, regardless of\r\nsurface-indications or the admonition of meddling wiseacres.\r\n\r\nThe rush for property resembled the wild scramble of the children when\r\nthe Pied Piper of Hamelin blew his fatal reed. Titusville was in a\r\nwhirlpool of excitement. Buildings arose as if by magic, the hamlet\r\nbecame a borough and the borough a city of fifteen-thousand inhabitants.\r\nMaxwell Titus sold lots at two-hundred dollars, people acquired homes\r\nthat doubled in value and speculation held undisputed sway. Jonathan\r\nTitus, from whom it was named, lived to witness the farm he cleared\r\ntransformed into “The Queen City,” noted for its tasteful residences,\r\nexcellent schools, manufactories, refineries and active population. One\r\nof his neighbors in the bush was Samuel Kerr, whose son Michael went to\r\nCongress and served as Speaker of the House. Many enterprising men\r\nsettled in Titusville for the sake of their families. They paved the\r\nstreets, planted shade-trees, fostered local industries, promoted\r\nculture and believed in public improvements. When Christine Nilsson\r\nenraptured sixteen-hundred well-dressed, appreciative listeners in the\r\nParshall Opera-House, the peerless songstress could not refrain from\r\nsaying that she never saw an audience so keen to note the finer points\r\nof her performance and so discriminating in its applause. “Praise from\r\nSir Hubert is praise indeed” and the compliment of the Swedish\r\nNightingale compressed a whole encyclopedia into a sentence. Titusville\r\nhas had its ups and downs, but there is no more desirable place in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n                “Auld Ayr, wham ne’er a town surpasses.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN STREET, TITUSVILLE, IN 1861.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DANIEL CADY.]\r\n\r\nMatches are supposed to be made in Heaven and the inspiration that led\r\nto the choice of such a site for the future city must have been derived\r\nfrom the same source. Healthfulness and beauty of location attest the\r\nwisdom of the selection. Folks don’t have to climb precipitous hills or\r\nrisk life and limb crossing railway-tracks whenever they wish to\r\nexercise their fast nags. Driving is a favorite pastime in fine weather,\r\nthe leading thoroughfares often reminding strangers of Central Park on a\r\ncoaching-day. Main, Walnut and Perry streets are lined with trees and\r\nresidences worthy of Philadelphia or Baltimore. Comfortable homes are\r\nthe crowning glory of a community and in this respect Titusville does\r\nnot require to take a back-seat. Near the lower end of Main street is\r\nEx-Mayor Caldwell’s elegant mansion, built by Jonathan Watson in the\r\ndays of his prosperity. Farther up are John Fertig’s, the late Marcus\r\nBrownson’s, Mrs. David Emery’s and Mrs. A. N. Perrin’s. Franklin S.\r\nTarbell, a former resident of Rouseville, occupies an attractive house.\r\nJoseph Seep, who has not changed an iota since the halcyon period of\r\nParker and Foxburg, shows his faith in the town by building a home that\r\nwould adorn Cleveland’s aristocratic Euclid Avenue. The host is the\r\ncordial Seep of yore, quick to make a point and not a bit backward in\r\nhelping a friend. David McKelvy, whom everybody knew in the lower\r\noil-fields, remodeled the Chase homestead, a symphony in red brick.\r\nClose by is W. T. Scheide’s natty dwelling, finished in a style\r\nbefitting the ex-superintendent of the National-Transit Pipe-Lines.\r\nByron D. Benson—he died in 1889—nine times elected president of the\r\nTidewater Pipe-Line-Company, lived on the corner of Oak and Perry\r\nstreets. Opposite is John L. McKinney’s luxurious residence, a credit to\r\nthe liberal owner and the city. J. C. McKinney’s is “one of the finest.”\r\nJames Parshall, W. B. Sterrett, O. D. Harrington, J. P. Thomas, W. W.\r\nThompson, Charles Archbold and hundreds more erected dwellings that\r\nbelong to the palatial tribe. Dr. Roberts—he’s in the cemetery—had a\r\nspacious place on Washington street, with the costliest stable in\r\nseventeen counties. E. O. Emerson’s house and grounds are the admiration\r\nof visitors. The grand fountain, velvet lawns, smooth walks, tropical\r\nplants, profusion of flowers, mammoth conservatory and Marechal-Niel\r\nrose-bushes bewilder the novice whose knowledge of floral affairs stops\r\nat button-hole bouquets. George K. Anderson—dead, too—constructed this\r\ndelightful retreat. Col. J. J. Carter, whose record as a military\r\nofficer, merchant, railroad-president and oil-operator will stand\r\ninspection, has an ideal home, purchased from John D. Archbold and\r\nrefitted throughout. It was built and furnished extravagantly by Daniel\r\nCady, once a leading spirit in the business and social life of\r\nTitusville. He was a man of imposing presence and indomitable pluck, the\r\nconfidant of Jay Gould and “Jim” Fisk, dashing, speculative and popular.\r\nFor years whatever he touched seemed to turn into gold and he computed\r\nhis dollars by hundreds of thousands. Days of adversity overtook him,\r\nthe splendid home was sacrificed and he died poor. To men of the stamp\r\nof Watson, Anderson, Abbott, Emery, Fertig and Cady Titusville owes its\r\nreal start in the direction of greatness. Much of the froth and fume of\r\nformer days is missing, but the baser elements have been eliminated,\r\ntrade is on a solid basis and important manufactures have been\r\nestablished. There are big refineries, Holly water-works, a race-track,\r\nball-grounds, top-notch hotels, live newspapers, inviting churches and a\r\nlovely cemetery in which to plant good citizens when they pass in their\r\nchecks. Pilgrims who expect to find Titusville dead or dying will be as\r\nbadly fooled as the lover whose girl eloped with the other fellow.\r\n\r\nUnluckily for himself, Colonel Drake took a narrow view of affairs.\r\nComplacently assuming that he had “tapped the mine”—to quote his own\r\nphrase—and that paying territory would not be found outside the\r\ncompany’s lease, he pumped the well serenely, told funny stories and\r\nsecured not one foot of ground! Had he possessed a particle of the\r\nprophetic instinct, had he grasped the magnitude of the issues at stake,\r\nhad he appreciated the importance of petroleum as a commercial product,\r\nhad he been able to “see an inch beyond his nose,” he would have gone\r\nforth that August morning and become “Master of the Oil Country!” “The\r\nworld was all before him where to choose,” he was literally “monarch of\r\nall he surveyed,” but he didn’t move a peg! Money was not needed, the\r\npromise of one-eighth or one-quarter royalty satisfying the easy-going\r\nfarmers, consequently he might have gathered in any quantity of land.\r\nFriends urged him to “get into the game;” he rejected their counsel and\r\nnever realized his mistake until other wells sent prices skyward and it\r\nwas everlastingly too late for his short pole to knock the persimmons.\r\nYet this is the man whom numerous writers have proclaimed “the\r\ndiscoverer of petroleum!” Times without number it has been said and\r\nwritten and printed that he was “the first man to advise boring for\r\noil,” that “his was the first mind to conceive the idea of penetrating\r\nthe rock in search of a larger deposit of oil than was dreamed of by any\r\none,” that “he alone unlocked one of nature’s vast storehouses” and “had\r\nvisions of a revolution in light and lubrication.” Considering what\r\nKier, Peterson, Bissell and Watson had done years before Drake ever\r\nsaw—perhaps ever heard of—a drop of petroleum, the absurdity of these\r\nclaims is “so plain that he who runs may read.” Couple with this his\r\nincredible failure to secure lands after the well was drilled—wholly\r\ninexcusable if he supposed oil-operations would ever be important—and\r\nthe man who thinks Colonel Drake was “the first man with a clear\r\nconception of the future of petroleum” could swallow the fish that\r\nswallowed Jonah!\r\n\r\nAbove all else history should be truthful and “hew to the line, let\r\nchips fall where they may.” Mindful that “the agent is but the\r\ninstrument of the principal,” why should Colonel Drake wear the laurels\r\nin this instance? Paid a salary to carry out Bissell’s plan of boring an\r\nartesian-well, he spent sixteen months getting the hole down seventy\r\nfeet. For a man who “had visions” and “a clear conception” his movements\r\nwere inexplicably slow. He encountered obstacles, but salt-wells had\r\nbeen drilled hundreds of feet without either a steam-engine or\r\nprofessional “borer.” The credit of suggesting the driving-pipe to\r\novercome the quicksand is justly his due. Quite as justly the credit of\r\nsuggesting the boring of the well belongs to George H. Bissell. The\r\ncompany hired Drake, Drake hired Smith, Smith did the work. Back of the\r\nman who possessed the skill to fashion the tools and sink the hole, back\r\nof the man who acted for the company and disbursed its money, back of\r\nthe company itself is the originator of the idea these were the means\r\nemployed to put into effect. Was George Stephenson, or the foreman of\r\nthe shop where the “Rocket” was built, the inventor of the locomotive?\r\nWas Columbus, or the man whose name it bears, the discoverer of America?\r\nIn a conversation on the subject Mr. Bissell remarked: “Let Colonel\r\nDrake enjoy the pleasure of giving the well his name; history will set\r\nus all right.” So it will and this is a step in that direction. If the\r\nlong-talked-of monument to commemorate the advent of the petroleum-era\r\never be erected, it should bear in boldest capitals the names of Samuel\r\nM. Kier and George H. Bissell.\r\n\r\nEdwin L. Drake, who is linked inseparably with the first oil-well in\r\nPennsylvania, was born on March eleventh, 1819, at Greenville, Greene\r\ncounty, New York. His father, a farmer, moved to Vermont in 1825. At\r\neighteen Edwin left home to begin the struggle with the world. He was\r\nnight-clerk of a boat running between Buffalo and Detroit, worked one\r\nyear on a farm in the Wolverine state, clerked two years in a Michigan\r\nhotel, returned east and clerked in a dry-goods store at New Haven,\r\nclerked and married in New York, removed to Massachusetts, was\r\nexpress-agent on the Boston & Albany railroad and resigned in 1849 to\r\nbecome conductor on the New-York & New-Haven. His younger brother died\r\nin the west and his wife at New Haven, in 1854, leaving one child. While\r\nboarding at a hotel in New Haven he met James M. Townsend, who persuaded\r\nhim to draw his savings of two-hundred dollars from the bank and buy\r\nstock of the Pennsylvania Rock-Oil-Company, his first connection with\r\nthe business that was to make him famous. Early in 1857 he married Miss\r\nLaura Dow, sickness in the summer compelled him to cease punching\r\ntickets and his memorable visit to Titusville followed in December. In\r\n1860 he was elected justice-of-the-peace, an office worth\r\ntwenty-five-hundred dollars that year, because of the enormous number of\r\nproperty-transfers to prepare and acknowledge. Buying oil on commission\r\nfor Shefflin Brothers, New York, swelled his income to five-thousand\r\ndollars for a year or two. He also bought twenty-five acres of land from\r\nJonathan Watson, east of Martin street and through the center of which\r\nDrake street now runs, for two-thousand dollars. Unable to meet the\r\nmortgage given for part of the payment, he sold the block in 1863 to Dr.\r\nA. D. Atkinson for twelve-thousand dollars. Forty times this sum would\r\nnot have bought it in 1867! With the profits of this transaction and his\r\nsavings for five years, in all about sixteen-thousand dollars, in the\r\nsummer of 1863 Colonel Drake left the oil-regions forever.\r\n\r\nEntering into partnership with a Wall-street broker, he wrecked his\r\nsmall fortune speculating in oil-stocks, his health broke down and he\r\nremoved to Vermont. Physicians ordered him to the seaside as the only\r\nremedy for his disease, neuralgic affection of the spine, which\r\nthreatened paralysis of the limbs and caused intense suffering. Near\r\nLong Branch, in a cottage offered by a friend, Mr. and Mrs. Drake drank\r\nthe bitter cup to the dregs. Their funds were exhausted, the patient\r\nneeded constant attention and helpless children cried for bread. The\r\ndevoted wife and mother attempted to earn a pittance with her needle,\r\nbut could not keep the wolf of hunger from the door. Medicine for the\r\nsick man was out of the question. All this time men in the region the\r\nDrake well had opened to the world were piling up millions of dollars!\r\nOne day in 1869, with eighty cents to pay his fare, Colonel Drake\r\nstruggled into New York to seek a place for his twelve-year-old boy. The\r\nerrand was fruitless. The distressed father was walking painfully on the\r\nstreet to the railway-station, to board the train for home, when he met\r\n“Zeb” Martin of Titusville, afterwards proprietor of the Hotel\r\nBrunswick. Mr. Martin noted his forlorn condition, inquired as to his\r\ncircumstances, learned the sad story of actual privation, procured\r\ndinner, gave the poor fellow twenty dollars and cheered him with the\r\nassurance that he would raise a fund for his relief. The promise was\r\nredeemed.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting in Titusville the case was stated and forty-two hundred\r\ndollars were subscribed. The money was forwarded to Mrs. Drake, who\r\nhusbanded it carefully. The terrible recital aroused such a feeling that\r\nthe Legislature, in 1873, granted Colonel Drake an annuity of\r\nfifteen-hundred dollars during his life and his heroic wife’s.\r\nCalifornia had set a good example by giving Colonel Sutter, the\r\ndiscoverer of gold in the mill-race, thirty-five-hundred dollars a year.\r\nThe late Thaddeus Stevens, “the Great Commoner,” hearing that Drake was\r\nactually in want, prepared a bill, found among his papers after his\r\ndeath, intending to present it before Congress for an appropriation of\r\ntwo-hundred-and-fifty-thousand dollars for Colonel Drake. In 1870 the\r\nfamily removed to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Years of suffering, borne\r\nwith sublime resignation, closed on the evening of November ninth, 1881,\r\nwith the release of Edwin L. Drake from this vale of tears. A faithful\r\nwife and four children survived the petroleum-pioneer. They lived at\r\nBethlehem until the spring of 1895 and then moved to New England.\r\nColonel Drake was a man of pronounced individuality, affable, genial and\r\nkindly. He had few superiors as a story-teller, neither caroused nor\r\nswore, and was of unblemished character. He wore a full beard, dressed\r\nwell, liked a good horse, looked every man straight in the face and his\r\ndark eyes sparkled when he talked. Gladly he laid down the heavy burden\r\nof a checkered life, with its afflictions and vicissitudes, for the\r\npeaceful rest of the grave.\r\n\r\n           “Since every man who lives is born to die * * *\r\n           Like pilgrims to the appointed place we tend;\r\n           The world’s an inn, and death the journey’s end.”\r\n\r\nGeorge H. Bissell, honorably identified with the petroleum-development\r\nfrom its inception, was a New-Hampshire boy. Thrown upon his own\r\nresources at twelve, by the death of his father, he gained education and\r\nfortune unaided. At school and college he supported himself by teaching\r\nand writing for magazines. Graduating from Dartmouth College in 1845, he\r\nwas professor of Greek and Latin in Norwich University a short time,\r\nwent to Washington and Cuba, did editorial work for the New Orleans\r\n_Delta_ and was chosen superintendent of the public schools. Impaired\r\nhealth forced him to return north in 1853, when his connection with\r\npetroleum began. From 1859 to 1863 he resided at Franklin, Venango\r\ncounty, to be near his oil-interests. He operated largely on Oil Creek,\r\non the Allegheny river and at Franklin, where he erected a\r\nbarrel-factory. He removed to New York in 1863, established the Bissell\r\nBank at Petroleum Centre in 1866, developed oil-lands in Peru and was\r\nprominent in financial circles. His wife died in 1867 and long since he\r\nfollowed her to the tomb. Mr. Bissell was a brilliant, scholarly man,\r\npositive in his convictions and sure to make his influence felt in any\r\ncommunity. His son and daughter reside in New York.\r\n\r\n                        “Pass some few years,\r\n          Thy flowering Spring, thy Summer’s ardent strength,\r\n          Thy sober Autumn fading into age,\r\n          And pale concluding Winter comes at last\r\n          And shuts the scene.”\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Smith, born in Butler county in 1812, at the age of twelve\r\nwas apprenticed at Freeport to learn blacksmithing. In 1827 he went to\r\nPittsburg and in 1842 opened a blacksmith-shop at Salina, below\r\nTarentum. Samuel M. Kier employed him to drill salt-wells and\r\nmanufacture drilling-tools. After finishing the Drake well, he drilled\r\nin various sections of the oil-regions, retiring to his farm in Butler a\r\nfew years prior to his death, on October twenty-third, 1890. “Uncle\r\nBilly,” as the boys affectionately called him, was no small factor in\r\ngiving to mankind the illuminator that enlightens every quarter of the\r\nglobe. The farm he owned in 1859 and on which he died proved good\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nDr. Francis B. Brewer was born in New Hampshire, studied medicine in\r\nPhiladelphia and practiced in Vermont. His father in 1840 purchased\r\nseveral thousand acres of land on Oil Creek for lumbering, and the firm\r\nof Brewer, Watson & Co. was promptly organized. Oil from the “spring” on\r\nthe island at the mouth of Pine Creek was sent to the young physician in\r\n1848 and used in his practice. He visited the locality in 1850 and was\r\nadmitted to the firm. Upon the completion of the Drake well he devoted\r\nhis time to the extensive oil-operations of the partnership for four\r\nyears. In 1864 Brewer, Watson & Co. sold the bulk of their oil-territory\r\nand the doctor, who had settled at Westfield, Chautauqua county, N. Y.,\r\ninstituted the First National Bank, of which he was chosen president. A\r\nman of solid worth and solid wealth, he has served as a Member of\r\nAssembly and is deservedly respected for integrity and benevolence.\r\n\r\nJonathan Watson, whose connection with petroleum goes back to the\r\nbeginning of developments, arrived at Titusville in 1845 to manage the\r\nlumbering and mercantile business of his firm. The hamlet contained ten\r\nfamilies and three stores. Deer and wild-turkeys abounded in the woods,\r\nJohn Robinson was postmaster and Rev. George O. Hampson the only\r\nminister. Mr. Watson’s views of petroleum were of the broadest and his\r\ntransactions the boldest. He hastened to secure lands when oil appeared\r\nin the Drake well. At eight o’clock on that historic Monday morning he\r\nstood at Hamilton McClintock’s door, resolved to buy or lease his\r\nthree-hundred-acre farm. A lease was taken and others along the stream\r\nfollowed during the day. Brewer, Watson & Co. operated on a wholesale\r\nscale until 1864, after which Watson continued alone. Riches poured upon\r\nhim. He erected the finest residence in Titusville, lavished money on\r\nthe grounds and stocked a fifty-thousand dollar conservatory with\r\nchoicest plants and flowers. A million dollars in gold he is credited\r\nwith “putting by for a rainy day.” He went miles ahead, bought huge\r\nblocks of land and drilled scores of test-wells. In this way he barely\r\nmissed opening the Bradford field and the Bullion district years before\r\nthese productive sections were brought into line. His well on the\r\nDalzell farm, Petroleum Centre, in 1869, renewed interest in that\r\nquarter long after it was supposed to be sucked dry. An Oil-City\r\nclairvoyant indicated the spot to sink the hole, promising a\r\nthree-hundred-barrel strike. Crude was six dollars a barrel and Watson\r\nreadily proffered the woman the first day’s production for her services.\r\nA check for two-thousand dollars was her reward, as the well yielded\r\nthree-hundred-and-thirty-three barrels the first twenty-four hours. Mrs.\r\nWatson was an ardent medium and her husband humored her by consulting\r\nthe “spirits” occasionally. She became a lecturer and removed to\r\nCalifornia long since. The tide of Watson’s prosperity ebbed. Bad\r\ninvestments and dry-holes ate into his splendid fortune. The\r\ngold-reserve was drawn upon and spent. The beautiful home went to\r\nsatisfy creditors. In old age the brave, hardy, indefatigable\r\noil-pioneer, who had led the way for others to acquire wealth, was\r\nstripped of his possessions. Hope and courage remained. He operated at\r\nWarren and revived some of the old wells around the Drake, which\r\nafforded him subsistence. Advanced years and anxiety enfeebled the\r\nstalwart fame. His steps faltered, and in 1893 protracted sickness\r\nclosed the busy, eventful life of the man who, more than any other,\r\nfostered and developed the petroleum-industry.\r\n\r\n                          “I am as a weed\r\n      Flung from the rock, on ocean’s foam to sail\r\n      Where’er the surge may sweep, the tempest’s breath prevail.”\r\n\r\nThe Drake well declined almost imperceptibly, yielding twelve barrels a\r\nday by the close of the year. It stood idle on Sundays and for a week in\r\nDecember. Smith had a light near a tank of oil, the gas from which\r\ncaught fire and burned the entire rig. This was the first “oil-fire” in\r\nPennsylvania, but it was destined to have many successors. Possibly it\r\nbrought back vividly to Colonel Drake the remembrance of his childish\r\ndream, in which he and his brother had set a heap of stubble ablaze and\r\ncould not extinguish the flames. His mother interpreted it: “My son, you\r\nhave set the world on fire.”\r\n\r\nThe total output of the well in 1859 was under eighteen-hundred barrels.\r\nOne-third of the oil was sold at sixty-five cents a gallon for shipment\r\nto Pittsburg. George M. Mowbray, the accomplished chemist, who came to\r\nTitusville in 1860 and played a prominent part in early refining,\r\ndisposed of a thousand barrels in New York. The well produced moderately\r\nfor two or three years from the first sand, until shut down by low\r\nprices, which made it ruinous to pay the royalty of twelve-and-a-half\r\ncents a gallon. A compromise was effected in 1860, by which the Seneca\r\nOil-Company retained a part of the land as fee and surrendered the lease\r\nto the Pennsylvania Rock-Oil-Company. Mr. Bissell purchased the stock of\r\nthe other shareholders in the latter company for fifty-thousand dollars.\r\nHe drilled ten wells, six of which for months yielded eighty barrels a\r\nday, on the tract known thenceforth as the Bissell farm, selling it\r\neventually to the Original Petroleum-Company. The Drake was deepened to\r\nfive-hundred feet and two others, drilled beneath the roof of the\r\nsawmill in 1862, were pumped by water.\r\n\r\nThe Drake machinery was stolen or scattered piecemeal. In 1876 J. J.\r\nAshbaugh, of St. Petersburg, and Thomas O’Donnell, of Foxburg, conveyed\r\nthe neglected derrick and engine-house to the Centennial at\r\nPhiladelphia, believing crowds would wish to look at the mementoes. The\r\nexhibition was a fizzle and the lumber was carted off as rubbish.\r\nEx-Senator Emery saved the drilling-tools and he has them in his private\r\nmuseum at Bradford. They are pigmies compared with the giants of to-day.\r\nA man could walk away with them as readily as Samson skipped with the\r\ngates of Gaza. Sandow and Cyril Cyr done up in a single package couldn’t\r\ndo that with a modern set. The late David Emery, a man of heart and\r\nbrain, contemplated reviving the old well—the land had come into his\r\npossession—and bottling the oil in tiny vials, the proceeds to be\r\napplied to a Drake monument. He put up a temporary rig and pumped a\r\nhalf-barrel a week. Death interrupted his generous purpose. Except that\r\nthe trees and the saw-mill have disappeared, the neighborhood of the\r\nDrake well is substantially the same as in the days when lumbering was\r\nat its height and the two-hundred honest denizens of Titusville slept\r\nwithout locking their doors. There is nothing to suggest to strangers or\r\ntravelers that the spot deserves to be remembered. How transitory is\r\nhuman achievement!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCATION AND SURROUNDINGS OF THE DRAKE WELL IN 1897.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Barnsdall, Boone Meade and Henry R. Rouse started the second\r\nwell in the vicinity, on the James Parker farm, formerly the Kerr tract\r\nand now the home of Ex-Mayor J. H. Caldwell. The location was north and\r\nwithin a stone’s throw of the Drake. In November, at the depth of eighty\r\nfeet, the well was pumped three days, yielding only five barrels of oil.\r\nThe outlook had an indigo-tinge and operations ceased for a week or two.\r\nResuming work in December, at one-hundred-and-sixty feet indications\r\nwere satisfactory. Tubing was put in on February nineteenth, 1860, and\r\nthe well responded at the rate of fifty barrels a day! In the language\r\nof a Hoosier dialect-poet: “Things wuz gettin’ inter-restin’!” William\r\nH. Abbott, a gentleman of wealth, reached Titusville on February ninth\r\nand bought an interest in the Parker tract the same month. David\r\nCrossley’s well, a short distance south of the Drake and the third\r\nfinished on Oil Creek, began pumping sixty barrels a day on March\r\nfourth. Local dealers, overwhelmed by an “embarrassment of riches,”\r\ncould not handle such a glut of oil. Schefflin Brothers arranged to\r\nmarket it in New York. Fifty-six-thousand gallons from the Barnsdall\r\nwell were sold for seventeen-thousand dollars by June first, 1860. J. D.\r\nAngier contracted to “stamp down a hole” for Brewer, Watson & Co., in a\r\npit fourteen feet deep, dug and cribbed to garner oil dipped from the\r\n“spring” on the Hamilton-McClintock farm. Piercing the rock by\r\n“hand-power” was a tedious process. December of 1860 dawned without a\r\nsymptom of greasiness in the well, from which wondrous results were\r\nanticipated on account of the “spring.” One day’s hand-pumping produced\r\ntwelve barrels of oil and so much water that an engine was required to\r\npump steadily. By January twentieth, 1861, the engine was puffing and\r\nthe well producing moderately, the influx of water diminishing the yield\r\nof oil. These four, with two getting under way on the Buchanan farm,\r\nnorth of the McClintock, and one on the J. W. McClintock tract, the site\r\nof Petroleum Centre, summed up all the wells actually begun on Oil Creek\r\nin 1859.\r\n\r\nThree of the four were “kicked down” by the aid of spring-poles, as were\r\nhundreds later in shallow territory. This method afforded a mode of\r\ndevelopment to men of limited means, with heavy muscles and light\r\npurses, although totally inadequate for deep drilling. An elastic pole\r\nof ash or hickory, twelve to twenty feet long, was fastened at one end\r\nto work over a fulcrum. To the other end stirrups were attached, or a\r\ntilting platform was secured by which two or three men produced a\r\njerking motion that drew down the pole, its elasticity pulling it back\r\nwith sufficient force, when the men slackened their hold, to raise the\r\ntools a few inches. The principle resembled that of the treadle-board of\r\na sewing-machine, operating which moves the needle up and down. The\r\ntools were swung in the driving-pipe or the “conductor”—a wooden tube\r\neight or ten inches square, placed endwise in a hole dug to the rock—and\r\nfixed by a rope to the spring-pole two or three feet from the workmen.\r\nThe strokes were rapid and a sand-pump—a spout three inches in diameter,\r\nwith a hinged bottom opening inward and a valve working on a\r\nsliding-rod, somewhat in the manner of a syringe—removed the borings\r\nmainly by sucking them into the spout as it was drawn out quickly.\r\nHorse-power, in its general features precisely the kind still used with\r\nthreshing-machines, was the next step forward. Steam-engines, employed\r\nfor drilling at Tidioute in September of 1860, reduced labor and\r\nexpedited work. The first pole-derricks, twenty-five to thirty-five feet\r\nhigh, have been superseded by structures that tower seventy-two to\r\nninety feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “KICKING DOWN” A WELL.]\r\n\r\nDrilling-tools, the chief novelty of which are the “jars”—a pair of\r\nsliding-bars moving within each other—have increased from two-hundred\r\npounds to three-thousand in weight. George Smith, at Rouseville, forged\r\nthe first steel-lined jars in 1866, for H. Leo Nelson, but the steel\r\ncould not be welded firmly. Nelson also adopted the “Pleasantville Rig”\r\non the Meade lease, Rouseville, in 1866, discarding the “Grasshopper.”\r\nIn the former the walking-beam is fastened in the centre to the\r\n“samson-post,” with one end attached to the rods in the well and the\r\nother to the band-wheel crank, exactly as in side-wheel steamboats.\r\nGeorge Koch, of East Sandy, Pa., patented numerous improvements on\r\npumping-rigs, drilling-tools and gas-rigs; for which he asked no\r\nremuneration. Primitive wells had a bore of three or four inches, half\r\nthe present size. To exclude surface-water a “seed-bag”—a leather-bag\r\nthe diameter of the hole—was tied tightly to the tubing, filled with\r\nflax-seed and let down to the proper depth. The top was left open and in\r\na few hours the flax swelled so that the space between the tubing and\r\nthe walls of the well was impervious to water. Drilling “wet holes” was\r\nslow and uncertain, as the tools were apt to break and the chances of a\r\npaying well could not be decided until the pump exhausted the water. It\r\nis surprising that over five-thousand wells were sunk with the rude\r\nappliances in vogue up to 1868, when “casing”—a larger pipe inserted\r\nusually to the top of the first sand—was introduced. This was the\r\ngreatest improvement ever devised in oil-developments and drilling has\r\nreached such perfection that holes can be put down five-thousand feet\r\nsafely and expeditiously. Devices multiplied as experience was gained.\r\n\r\nThe tools that drilled the Barnsdall, Crossley and Watson wells were the\r\nhandiwork of Jonathan Lock, a Titusville blacksmith. Mr. Lock attained\r\nhis eighty-third year, died at Bradford in March of 1895 and was buried\r\nat Titusville, the city in which he passed much of his active life. He\r\nwas a worthy type of the intelligent, industrious American mechanics, a\r\nclass of men to whom civilization is indebted for unnumbered comforts\r\nand conveniences. John Bryan, who built the first steam-engine in Warren\r\ncounty, started the first foundry and Machine-shop in Oildom and\r\norganized the firm of Bryan, Dillingham & Co., began the manufacture of\r\ndrilling-tools in Titusville in 1860.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JONATHAN LOCK.]\r\n\r\nOf the partners in the second well William Barnsdall survives. He has\r\nlived in Titusville sixty-four years, served as mayor and operated\r\nextensively. His son Theodore, who pumped wells on the Parker and Weed\r\nfarms, adjoining the Barnsdall homestead, is among the largest and\r\nwealthiest producers. Crossley’s sons rebuilt the rig at their father’s\r\nwell in 1873, drilled the hole deeper and obtained considerable oil.\r\nOther wells around the Drake were treated similarly, paying a fair\r\nprofit. In 1875 this spasmodic revival of the earliest territory died\r\nout—Machinery was removed and the derricks rotted. Jonathan Watson, in\r\n1889, drilled shallow wells, cleaned out several of the old ones and\r\nawakened brief interest in the cradle of developments. Gas burning and\r\nwells pumping, thirty years after the first strike, seemed indeed\r\nstrange. Not a trace of these repeated operations remains. The Parker\r\nand neighboring farms north-west and north of Titusville proved\r\ndisappointing, owing to the absence of the third sand, which a hole\r\ndrilled two-thousand feet by Jonathan Watson failed to reveal. The\r\nParker-Farm Petroleum Company of Philadelphia bought the land in 1863\r\nand in 1870 twelve wells were producing moderately. West and south-west\r\nthe Octave Oil-Company has operated profitably for twenty years and\r\nChurch Run has produced generously. Probably two-hundred wells were sunk\r\nabove Titusville, at Hydetown, Clappville, Tryonville, Centerville,\r\nRiceville, Lincolnville and to Oil-Creek Lake, in vain attempts to\r\ndiscover juicy territory.\r\n\r\nEx-Mayor William Barnsdall is the oldest living pioneer of Titusville.\r\nNot only has he seen the town grow from a few houses to its present\r\nproportions, but he is one of its most esteemed citizens. Born at\r\nBiggleswade, Bedfordshire, England, on February sixth, 1810, he lived\r\nthere until 1831, when he came to America. In 1832 he arrived at what is\r\nknown as the English Settlement, seven miles north of Titusville. The\r\nBarnsdalls founded the settlement, Joseph, a brother of William,\r\nclearing a farm in the wilderness that then covered the country.\r\nRemaining in the settlement a year, in 1833 William Barnsdall came to\r\nthe hamlet of Titusville, where he has ever since resided. He\r\nestablished a small shop to manufacture boots and shoes, continuing at\r\nthe business until the discovery of oil in 1859. Immediately after the\r\ncompletion of the Drake strike he began drilling the second well on Oil\r\nCreek. Before this well produced oil, in February of 1860, he sold a\r\npart interest to William H. Abbott for ten-thousand dollars. He\r\nassociated himself with Abbott and James Parker and, early in 1860,\r\ncommenced the first oil-refinery on Oil Creek. It was sold to Jonathan\r\nWatson for twenty-five-thousand dollars. From those early days to the\r\npresent Mr. Barnsdall has been identified with the production of\r\npetroleum. At the ripe age of eighty-seven years, respected as few men\r\nare in any community and enjoying an unusual measure of mental and\r\nphysical strength, he calmly awaits “the inevitable hour.”\r\n\r\nHon. David Emery, the last owner of the Drake well, was for many years a\r\nsuccessful oil-operator. At Pioneer he drilled a number of prime wells,\r\nfollowing the course of developments along Oil Creek. He organized the\r\nOctave Oil-Company and was its chief officer. Removing to Titusville, he\r\nerected a fine residence and took a prominent part in public affairs.\r\nHis purse was ever open to forward a good cause. Had the Republican\r\nparty, of which he was an active member, been properly alive to the\r\ninterests of the Commonwealth, he would have been Auditor-General of\r\nPennsylvania. In all the relations and duties of life David Emery was a\r\nmodel citizen. Called hence in the vigor of stalwart manhood, multitudes\r\nof attached friends cherish his memory as that “of one who loved his\r\nfellow-men.”\r\n\r\nBorn in England in 1818, David Crossley ran away from home and came to\r\nAmerica as a stowaway in 1828. He found relatives at Paterson, N.J., and\r\nlived with them until about 1835, when he bound himself out to learn\r\nblacksmithing. On March seventeenth, 1839, he married Jane Alston and in\r\nthe winter of 1841-2 walked from New York to Titusville, walking back in\r\nthe spring. The following autumn he brought his family to Titusville.\r\nFor a few years he tried farming, but gave it up and went back to his\r\ntrade until 1859, when he formed a partnership with William Barnsdall,\r\nWilliam H. Abbott and P. T. Witherop, under the firm-name of Crossley,\r\nWitherop & Co., and began drilling the third well put down on Oil Creek.\r\nThe well was completed on March tenth, 1860, having been drilled\r\none-hundred-and-forty feet with a spring-pole. It produced at the rate\r\nof seventy-five barrels per day for a short time. The next autumn the\r\nproperty was abandoned on account of decline in production. In 1865\r\nCrossley bought out his partners and drilled the well to a depth of\r\nfive-hundred-and-fifty feet, but again abandoned it because of water. In\r\n1872 he and his sons drilled other wells upon the same property and in a\r\nshort time had so reduced the water that the investment became a paying\r\none. In 1873 he and William Barnsdall and others drilled the first\r\nproducing well in the Bradford oil-field. His health failed in 1875 and\r\nhe died on October eleventh, 1880, esteemed by all for his manliness and\r\nintegrity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Z. MARTIN]\r\n\r\nZ. Martin, who befriended Drake in his sad extremity, landed at\r\nTitusville in March of 1860 and pumped the Barnsdall, Mead & Rouse well\r\non Parker’s flat, the first well in Crawford county that produced oil.\r\nIn 1861 he went to the Clapp farm, above Oil City, as superintendent of\r\nthe Boston Rock-Oil-Company, only three of whose eighteen wells were\r\npaying ventures. The Company quitting, Martin bought and shipped crude\r\nto Pittsburg for Brewer, Burke & Co., traveling to the wells on\r\nhorseback to secure oil for his boats. He bought the Eagle Hotel at\r\nTitusville in 1862, conducted it two years and sold the building to C.\r\nV. Culver for bank-purposes. Mr. Martin resided at Titusville many years\r\nand was widely known as the capable landlord of the palatial Hotel\r\nBrunswick. He was the intimate friend of Colonel Drake, Jonathan Watson,\r\nGeorge H. Bissell and the pioneer operators on Oil Creek. His son, L. L.\r\nMartin, is running the Commercial Hotel at Meadville, where the father\r\nmakes his home, young in everything but years and always pleased to\r\ngreet his oil-region acquaintances.\r\n\r\nThus dawned the petroleum-day that could not be hidden under myriads of\r\nbushels. The report of the Drake well traveled “from Greenland’s icy\r\nmountains” to “India’s coral strands,” causing unlimited guessing as to\r\nthe possible outcome. Crude-petroleum was useful for various things, but\r\na farmer who visited the newest wonder hit a fresh lead. Begging a jug\r\nof oil, he paralyzed Colonel Drake by observing as he strode off:\r\n“This’ll be durned good tew spread onto buckwheat-cakes!”\r\n\r\nBishop Simpson once delivered his lecture on “American Progress,” in\r\nwhich he did not mention petroleum, before an immense Washington\r\naudience. President Lincoln heard it and said, as he and the eloquent\r\nspeaker came out of the hall: “Bishop, you didn’t ‘strike ile’!”\r\n\r\nWhen the Barnsdall well, on the Parker farm, produced hardly any oil\r\nfrom the first sand, the coming Mayor of Titusville quietly clinched the\r\nargument in favor of drilling it deeper by remarking: “It’s a long way\r\nfrom the bottom of that hole to China and I’m bound to bore for\r\ntea-leaves if we don’t get the grease sooner!”\r\n\r\n“De Lawd thinks heaps ob Pennsylvany,” said a colored exhorter in\r\nPittsburg, “fur jes’ ez whales iz gettin’ sca’ce he pints outen de way\r\nfur Kunnel Drake ter ’scoveh petroleum!” A solemn preacher in Crawford\r\ncounty held a different opinion. One day he tramped into Titusville to\r\nrelieve his burdened mind. He cornered Drake on the street and warned\r\nhim to quit taking oil from the ground. “Do you know,” he hissed, “that\r\nyou’re interfering with the Almighty Creator of the universe? God put\r\nthat oil in the bowels of the earth to burn the world at the last day\r\nand you, poor worm of the dust, are trying to thwart His plans!” No\r\nwonder the loud check in the Colonel’s barred pantaloons wilted at this\r\nunexpected outburst, which Drake often recounted with extreme gusto.\r\n\r\nThe night “Uncle Billy” Smith’s lantern ignited the tanks at the Drake\r\nwell the blaze and smoke of the first oil-fire in Pennsylvania ascended\r\nhigh. A loud-mouthed professor of religion, whose piety was of the brand\r\nthat needed close watching in a horse-trade, saw the sight and scampered\r\nto the hills shouting: “It’s the day of judgment!” How he proposed to\r\ndodge the reckoning, had his surmise been correct, the terrified victim\r\ncould not explain when his fright subsided and friends rallied him on\r\nthe scare.\r\n\r\nThe Drake well blazed the path in the wilderness that set petroleum on\r\nits triumphant march. This nation, already the most enlightened, was to\r\nbe the most enlightening under the sun. An Atlantic of oil lay beneath\r\nits feet. America, its young, plump sister, could laugh at lean Europe.\r\nWar raged and the old world sought to drain the republic of its gold.\r\nThe United States exported mineral-fat and kept the yellow dross at\r\nhome. Petroleum was crowned king, dethroning cotton and yielding a\r\nrevenue, within four years of Drake’s modest strike, exceeding that from\r\ncoal and iron combined! Talk of California’s gold-fever, Colorado’s\r\nsilver-furore and Barney Barnato’s Caffir-mania.\r\n\r\nAmerican petroleum is a leading article of commerce, requiring hundreds\r\nof vessels to transport it to distant lands. Its refined product is\r\nknown all over the civilized world. It has found its way to every part\r\nof Europe and the remotest portions of Asia. It shines on the western\r\nprairie, burns in the homes of New England and illumines miles of\r\nprincely warehouses in the great cities of America. Everywhere is it to\r\nbe met with, in the Levant and the Orient, in the hovel of the Russian\r\npeasant and the harem of the Turkish pasha. It is the one article\r\nimported from the United States and sold in the bazaars of Bagdad, the\r\n“City of the Thousand-and-One-Nights.” It lights the dwellings, the\r\ntemples and the mosques amid the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh. It is the\r\nlight of Abraham’s birthplace and of the hoary city of Damascus. It\r\nburns in the Grotto of the Nativity at Bethlehem, in the Church of the\r\nHoly Sepulchre at Jerusalem, on the Acropolis of Athens and the plains\r\nof Troy, in cottage and palace along the banks of the Bosphorus, the\r\nEuphrates, the Tigris and the Golden Horn. It has penetrated China and\r\nJapan, invaded the fastnesses of Tartary, reached the wilds of Australia\r\nand shed its radiance over African wastes. Pennsylvania petroleum is the\r\ntrue cosmopolite, omnipresent and omnipotent in fulfilling its mission\r\nof illuminating the universe! A product of nature that is such a\r\ncontrolling influence in the affairs of men may well challenge attention\r\nto its origin, its history and its economic uses.\r\n\r\nAll this from a three-inch hole seventy feet in the ground!\r\n\r\n                 A grape-seed is a small affair,\r\n                   Yet, swallow’d when you sup,\r\n                 In your appendix it may stick\r\n                   Till doctors carve you up.\r\n\r\n                 A coral-insect is not large,\r\n                   Still it can build a reef\r\n                 On which the biggest ship that floats\r\n                   May quickly come to grief.\r\n\r\n                 A hint, a word, a look, a breath\r\n                   May bear envenom’d stings,\r\n                 From all of which the moral learn:\r\n                   Despise not little things!\r\n\r\n                             IN A NUTSHELL.\r\n\r\nColonel Drake used the first driving pipe.\r\n\r\nAdolph Schreiner, of Austria, made the first petroleum-lamp.\r\n\r\nThe first oil-well drilled by steam power was opposite Tidioute, in\r\n1860.\r\n\r\nJonathan Watson put down the first deep well on Oil Creek—2,130 feet—in\r\n1866.\r\n\r\nWilliam Phillips boated the first cargo of oil down the Allegheny to\r\nPittsburg in March, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese were the first to drill with tools attached to ropes, which\r\nthey twisted from rattan.\r\n\r\nThe Liverpool Lamp, devised by an unknown Englishman, was the first to\r\nhave a glass-chimney and do away with smoke.\r\n\r\nThe first tubing in oil-wells was manufactured at Pittsburg, with brass\r\nscrew-joints soldered on the pipe, the same as at Tarentum salt-wells.\r\n\r\nThe first steamboat reached the mouth of Oil Creek in 1828, with a load\r\nof Pittsburgers. The first train crossed Oil Creek into Oil City on a\r\ntrack on the ice.\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Smith, who drilled the Drake well, made the first rimmer.\r\nWhile enlarging a well with a bit the point broke off, after which\r\ngreater progress was noted. The accident suggested the rimmer.\r\n\r\nThe first white settler in the Pennsylvania oil-regions was John\r\nFrazier, who built a cabin at Wenango—Franklin—in 1745, kept a gun-shop\r\nand traded with the Indians until driven off by the French in 1753, the\r\nyear of George Washington’s visit.\r\n\r\nJonathan Titus located at Titusville in 1797, on land made famous by the\r\nDrake well. In that year the first oil skimmed from Oil Creek to be\r\nmarketed was sold at Pittsburg, then a collection of log-cabins, at\r\n_sixteen dollars a gallon_! Now people kick at half that many cents for\r\nthe refined article.\r\n\r\nEarly well-owners found the tools and fuel, paid all expenses but labor\r\nand paid three-dollars-and-fifty-cents per foot to the contractor, yet\r\nso many contractors failed that a lien-law was passed. George Koch, in\r\nNovember of 1873, took out a patent on fluted drills, which did away\r\nwith the rimmer, reduced the time of drilling a well from sixty days to\r\ntwenty and reduced the price from three dollars per foot to fifty cents.\r\n\r\nSam Taft was the first to use a line to control the engine from the\r\nderrick, at a well near McClintockville, in 1867. Henry Webber was the\r\nfirst to regulate the motion of the engine from the derrick. He drilled\r\na well near Smoky City, on the Porter farm, in 1863, with a rod from the\r\nderrick to the throttle-valve. He also dressed the tools, with the forge\r\nin the derrick, perhaps the first time this was done. He drilled this\r\nwell six-hundred feet with no help. Near this well was the first\r\nplank-derrick in the oil-country.\r\n\r\nThe first derricks were of poles, twelve feet base and twenty-eight to\r\nthirty feet high. The ladder was made by putting pins through a corner\r\nof a leg of the derrick. The Samson-post was mortised in the ground. The\r\nband-wheel was hung in a frame like a grindstone. A single bull-wheel,\r\nmade out of about a thousand feet of lumber, placed on the side of the\r\nderrick next to the band-wheel, with a rope or old rubber-belt for a\r\nbrake, was used. When the tools were let down the former would burn and\r\nsmoke, the latter would smell like ancient codfish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAJ. W. T. BAUM.\r\n  JACOB SHEASLEY.     HENRY F.

If there are “tongues in trees” and\r\n“sermons in stones” the trickling stream of greenish liquid murmured:\r\n“Bring on your lamps—we can fill them!” The _second_ oil-well in\r\nPennsylvania, eighteen miles from Col. Drake’s, changed the strain to:\r\n“Bring on your wheels—we can grease them!” America was to be the world’s\r\nilluminator and lubricator—not merely to dispel gloom and chase\r\nhobgoblins, but to increase the power of machinery by decreasing the\r\nimpediments to easy motion. Friction has cost enough for extra wear and\r\nstoppages and breakages “to buy every darkey forty acres and a mule.”\r\nThe first coal-oil for sale in this country was manufactured at Waltham,\r\nMass., in 1852, by Luther Atwood, who called it “Coup Oil,” from the\r\nrecent _coup_ of Louis Napoleon. Although highly esteemed as a\r\nlubricator, its offensive odor and poor quality would render it\r\nunmerchantable to-day. Samuel Downer’s hydro-carbon oils in 1856 were\r\nmarked improvements, yet they would cut a sorry figure beside the\r\nunrivaled lubricant produced from the wells at Franklin, the county-seat\r\nof Venango. It is a coincidence that the petroleum era should have\r\nintroduced light and lubrication almost simultaneously, one on Oil\r\nCreek, the other on French Creek, and both in a region comparatively\r\nisolated. “Misfortunes never come singly,” said the astounded father of\r\ntwins, in a paroxysm of bewilderment; but happily blessings often come\r\ntreading closely on each other’s heels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. B. NICKLIN.]\r\n\r\nPleasantly situated on French Creek and the Allegheny River, Franklin\r\nis an interesting town, with a history dating from the middle of the\r\neighteenth century. John Frazer, a gunsmith, occupied a hut and traded\r\nwith the Indians in 1747. Four forts, one French, one British and two\r\nAmerican, were erected in 1754, 1760, 1787 and 1796. Captain Joncaire\r\ncommanded the French forces. George Washington, a British lieutenant,\r\nwith no premonition of fathering a great country, visited the spot in\r\n1753. The north-west was a wilderness and Pittsburg had not been laid\r\nout. Franklin was surveyed in 1795, created a borough in 1829 and a\r\ncity in 1869, deriving its chief importance from petroleum. Lofty\r\nhills and winding streams are conspicuous. Spring-water is abundant,\r\nthe air is invigorating and healthfulness is proverbial. James\r\nJohnston, a negro-farmer of Frenchcreek township, stuck it out for\r\none-hundred-and-nine summers, lamenting that death got around six\r\nmonths too soon for him to attend the Philadelphia Centennial. Angus\r\nMcKenzie, of Sugarcreek, whose strong-box served as a bank in early\r\ndays, reached one-hundred-and-eight. Mrs. McDowell, a pioneer, was\r\nbright and nimble three years beyond the century-mark. Galbraith\r\nMcMullen, of Waterloo, touched par. John Morrison, the first\r\ncourt-crier, rounded out ninety-eight. A successor, Robert Lytle, was\r\nsummoned at eighty-seven, his widow living to celebrate her\r\nninety-fourth birthday. David Smith succumbed at ninety-nine and\r\nWilliam Raymond at ninety-three. Mr. Raymond was straight as an arrow,\r\nwalked smartly and in youth was the close friend of John J. Pearson,\r\nwho began to practice law at Franklin and was President Judge of\r\nDauphin county thirty-three years. J. B. Nicklin, fifty years a\r\nrespected citizen, died in 1890 at eighty-nine. To the end he retained\r\nhis mental and physical strength, kept the accounts of the Baptist\r\nchurch, was at his desk regularly and could hit the bullseye with the\r\ncrack shots of the military company. William Hilands, county-surveyor,\r\nwas a familiar figure on the streets at eighty-seven. Rev. Dr. Crane\r\npreached, lectured, visited the sick and continued to do good at\r\neighty-six. Grandma Snyder is eighty-eight and Benjamin May, a few\r\nmiles up the Allegheny, is hardy and hearty at ninety-one. At\r\neighty-five “Uncle Billy” Grove, of Canal, would hunt deer in Forest\r\ncounty and walk farther and faster than any man in the township. The\r\npeople who have rubbed fourscore would fill a ten-acre patch. Of\r\ncourse, some get sick and die young, or the doctors would starve,\r\nheaven would be short of youthful tenants and the theories of Malthus\r\nmight have to be tried on.\r\n\r\nFranklin boasts the finest stone side-walks in the State. There are\r\nimposing churches, shady parks, broad streets, cosy homes, spacious\r\nstores, first-class schools, fine hotels and inviting drives. For\r\nyears the Baptist quartette has not been surpassed in New York or\r\nPhiladelphia. The opera-house is a gem. Three railroads—a fourth is\r\ncoming that will lop off sixty-five miles between New York and\r\nChicago—and electric street-cars supply rapid transit. Five\r\nsubstantial banks, a half-dozen millionaires, two-dozen\r\nhundred-thousand-dollar-citizens and multitudes of well-to-do\r\nproperty-holders give the place financial backbone. Manufactures\r\nflourish, wages are liberal and many workmen own their snug houses.\r\nProbably no town in the United States, of seven-thousand population,\r\nhas greater wealth, better society and a kindlier feeling clear\r\nthrough the community.\r\n\r\nOn the south bank of French Creek, at Twelfth and Otter streets, James\r\nEvans, blacksmith, had lived twenty years. A baby when his parents\r\nsettled farther up in 1802, he removed to Franklin in 1839. His house\r\nstood near the “spring” from which Hulings and Whitman wrung out the\r\nviscid scum. In dry weather the well he dug seventeen feet for water\r\nsmelled and tasted of petroleum. Tidings of Drake’s success set the\r\nblacksmith thinking. Drake had bored into the well close to the “spring”\r\nand found oil. Why not try the experiment at Franklin? Evans was not\r\nflush of cash, but the hardware-dealer trusted him for the iron and he\r\nhammered out rough drilling-tools. He and his son Henry rigged a\r\nspring-pole and bounced the drill in the water-well. At seventy-two feet\r\na crevice was encountered. The tools dropped, breaking off a fragment of\r\niron, which obstinately refused to be fished out. Pumping by hand would\r\ndetermine whether a prize or a blank was to be drawn in the greasian\r\nlottery. Two men plied the pump vigorously. A stream of dark-green fluid\r\ngushed forth at the rate of twenty-five barrels a day. It was heavy oil,\r\nabout thirty degrees gravity, free from grit and smooth as silk. The\r\ngreatest lubricant on earth had been unearthed!\r\n\r\nPicture the pandemonium that followed. Franklin had no such convulsion\r\nsince the William B. Duncan, the first steamboat, landed one Sunday\r\nevening in January, 1828. The villagers speeded to the well as though\r\nall the imps of sheol were in pursuit. November court adjourned in half\r\nthe number of seconds Sut Lovingood’s nest of hornets broke up the\r\nAfrican camp-meeting. Judge John S. McCalmont, whose able opinions the\r\nSupreme Court liked to adopt, decided there was ample cause for action.\r\nA doctor rushed to the scene hatless, coatless and shoeless. Women\r\ndeserted their households without fixing their back-hair or getting\r\ninside their dress-parade toggery. Babies cried, children screamed, dogs\r\nbarked, bells rang and two horses ran away. At prayer-meeting a ruling\r\nelder, whom the events of the day had wrought to fever-heat, raised a\r\nhilarious snicker by imploring God to “send a shower of blessings—yea,\r\nLord, twenty-five barrels of blessings!” Altogether it was a red-letter\r\nforenoon, for twenty-five barrels a day of thirty-dollar oil none felt\r\ninclined to sneeze at.\r\n\r\nThat night a limb of the law, “dressed in his best suit of clothes,”\r\ncalled at the Evans domicile. Miss Anna, one of the fair daughters of\r\nthe house, greeted him at the door and said jokingly: “Dad’s struck\r\nile!” The expression caught the town, making a bigger hit than the well\r\nitself. It spread far and wide, was printed everywhere and enshrined\r\npermanently in the petroleum-vernacular. The young lady married Miles\r\nSmith, the eminent furniture-dealer, still trading on Thirteenth street.\r\nIn 1875 Mr. Smith revisited his native England, after many years’\r\nabsence. Meeting a party of gentlemen at a friend’s house, the\r\nconversation turned upon Pennsylvania. “May I awsk, Mr. Smith,” a\r\nLondoner inquired, “if you hever ’eard in your ’ome about ‘dad’s stwuck\r\nile’? I wead it in the papahs, doncherknow, but I fawncied it nevah\r\nweally ’appened.” Mr. Smith _had_ “’eard” it and the delight of the\r\ncompany, when he recited the circumstances and told of marrying the\r\ngirl, may be conceived. The phrase is billed for immortality.\r\n\r\nSufficient oil to pay for an engine was soon pumped. Steam-power\r\nincreased the yield to seventy barrels! Franklin became the Mecca of\r\nspeculators, traders, dealers and monied men. Frederic Prentice, a\r\nleader in aggressive enterprises, offered forty-thousand dollars for the\r\nwell and lot. Evans rejected the bid and kept the well, which declined\r\nto ten or twelve barrels within six months. The price of oil shrank like\r\na flannel-shirt, but the lucky disciple of Vulcan realized a nice\r\ncompetence. He enjoyed his good fortune some years before journeying to\r\n“that bourne from which no traveler e’er returns.” Mrs. Evans long\r\nsurvived, dying at eighty-six. The son removed to Kansas, three\r\ndaughters died and one resides at Franklin. The old well experienced its\r\ncomplement of fluctuations. Mosely & Co., of Philadelphia, leased it. It\r\nstood idle, the engine was taken away, the rig tumbled and the hole\r\nfilled up partially with dirt and wreckage. Prices spurted and the well\r\nwas hitched to a pumping-rig operating others around it. Captain S. A.\r\nHull ran a group of the wells on the flats and a dozen three miles down\r\nthe Allegheny. He was a man of generous impulses, finely educated and\r\nexceedingly companionable. His death, in 1893, resulted in dismantling\r\nmost of these wells, hardly a vestige remaining to tell that the Evans\r\nand its neighbors ever existed.\r\n\r\nJames Evans was not “left blooming alone” in the search for oily worlds\r\nto conquer. Companies were organized while he was yanking the tools in\r\nthe well that “set ’em crazy.” The first of these—The Franklin\r\nOil-and-Mining-Company—started work on October fifth, twenty rods below\r\nEvans, finding oil at two-hundred-and-forty-one feet on January twelfth,\r\n1860. The well pumped about one-half as much as the Evans for several\r\nmonths, but did not die of old age. The forty-two shares of stock\r\nadvanced ten-fold in one week, selling at a thousand dollars each. Three\r\nor four wells were put down, the company dissolving and members\r\noperating on their own hook. It was strongly officered, with Arnold\r\nPlumer as president; J. P. Hoover, vice-president; Aaron W. Raymond,\r\nsecretary; James Bleakley, Robert Lamberton, R. A. Brashear, J. L. Hanna\r\nand Thomas Hoge, executive committee. Mr. Plumer was a dominant factor\r\nin Democratic politics, largely instrumental in the nomination of James\r\nBuchanan for President, twice a member of Congress, twice\r\nState-Treasurer, Canal-Commissioner and founder of the First-National\r\nBank. At his death, in 1869, he devised his family an estate that\r\nappraised several million dollars, making it the largest in Venango\r\ncounty. Judge Lamberton opened the first bank in the oil-regions, owned\r\nhundreds of houses and in 1885 bequeathed each of his eight children a\r\nhandsome fortune. Colonel Bleakley rose by his own exertions, keen\r\nforesight and skillful management. He invested in productive realty,\r\ndrilled scores of wells around Franklin, built iron-tanks and\r\nbrick-blocks, established a bank, held thousands of acres of lands and\r\nin 1884 left a very large inheritance to his sons and daughters. Mr.\r\nRaymond developed the Raymilton district—it was named from him—in which\r\nhundreds of fair wells have rewarded Franklin operators, and at\r\neighty-nine was exceedingly quick in his movements. Mr. Brashear, a\r\ncivil engineer and exemplary citizen, has been in the grave twenty\r\nyears. Mr. Hanna operated heavily in oil, acquired numerous farms and\r\nerected the biggest block—it contained the first opera-house—in the\r\ncity. He is handling real-estate, but his former partner, John Duffield,\r\nslumbers in the cemetery. Mr. Hoge, an influential politician, elected\r\nto the Legislature two terms and Mayor one term, has also joined the\r\nsilent majority.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1860, Caldwell & Co., a block southeast of Evans, finished\r\na paying well at two-hundred feet. The Farmers and Mechanics’ Company,\r\nLevi Dodd, president, drilled a medium producer at the foot of High\r\nstreet, on the bank of the creek. Mr. Dodd was an old settler,\r\noriginator of the first Sabbath-school in Franklin and a ruling-elder\r\nfor over fifty years. Numerous companies and individuals pushed work in\r\nthe spring. Holes were sunk in front yards, gardens and water-wells.\r\nDerricks dotted the landscape thickly. Franklin was the objective point\r\nof immense crowds of people. The earliest wells were shallow, seldom\r\nexceeding two-hundred feet. The Mammoth, near a huge walnut tree back of\r\nthe Evans lot, began flowing on May fifteenth to the tune of a hundred\r\nbarrels. This was the first “spouter” in the district and it quadrupled\r\nthe big excitement. Four-hundred barrels of oil were shipped to\r\nPittsburg, by the steamboat Venango, on April twenty-seventh. Twenty-two\r\nwells were drilling and twenty producing on July first. Farms for miles\r\nup French Creek had been bought at high prices and the noise of the\r\ndrill permeated the summer ozone. Four miles west of Franklin, zig-zag\r\nSugar Creek shared in the activity. Then the prices “came down like a\r\nthousand of brick.” Pumping was expensive, lands were scarce and dear,\r\nhauling the oil to a railroad cost half its value and hosts of small\r\nwells were abandoned. On November first, within the borough limits,\r\nfifteen were yielding one-hundred-and-forty barrels. Curtz & Strain had\r\nbored five-hundred feet in October, the deepest well in the\r\nneighborhood, without finding additional oil-bearing rock. The\r\nPresidential election foreboded trouble, war-clouds loomed up and the\r\nyear closed gloomily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n      LEVI DODD.\r\n                COL. BLEAKLEY.\r\n                              J. LINDSAY HANNA.\r\n                                                 AARON W. RAYMOND.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of Franklin heavy-oil as a lubricant were quickly\r\nrecognized. It possessed a “body” that artificial oils could not rival.\r\nIn the crude state it withstood a cold-test twenty degrees below zero.\r\nHere is where it “had the bulge” on alleged lubricants which solidify\r\ninto a sort of liver with every twitch of frost. The producing-area of\r\nheavy-oil is restricted to a limited section, where the first sand is\r\nthirty to sixty feet thick and the lower sands were entirely omitted in\r\nthe original distribution of strata. For years operators hugged the\r\nbanks of the streams and the low grounds, keeping off the hills more\r\nwillingly than General Coxey kept off the Washington grass. The famous\r\n“Point Hill,” across French Creek from the Evans well, went begging for\r\na purchaser. At its southern base Mason & Lane, Cook & Co., Welsby &\r\nSmith, Shuster, Andrews, Green and others had profitable wells, but\r\nnobody dreamed of boring through the steep “Point” for oil. J. Lowry\r\nDewoody offered the lordly hill, with its forty acres of dense\r\nevergreen-brush, to Charles Miller for fifteen-hundred dollars. He\r\nwanted the money to drill on the flats and the hill was an elephant on\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\nDuring the Columbian Exposition an aged man alighted from a western\r\ntrain at the union-depot in Chicago. His rifle and his buckskin-suit\r\nindicated the Kit-Carson brand of hunter. He gazed about him in\r\namazement and a crowd assembled. “Wal,” ejaculated the white-haired\r\nNimrod, “this be Chicago, eh? Sixty years ago I killed lots ov game\r\nright whar we stan’ an’ old man Kinzey fell all over hisse’f to trade me\r\na hunnerd acre ov land fur a pair ov cowhide boots! I might hev took him\r\nup, but, consarn it, I didn’t hev the boots!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. LOWRY DEWOODY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM PAINTER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD RIAL.]\r\n\r\nSomething of this kind would apply to Mr. Miller and the Dewoody\r\nproposition. He had embarked in the business that was to bring him\r\nwealth and honor, but just at that time “didn’t hev” the fifteen-hundred\r\nto spare from his working-capital for the fun of owning a hill presumed\r\nto be worthless except for scenery. Colonel Bleakley and Dr. A. G.\r\nEgbert bought it later at a low figure. Operators scaled the slopes and\r\nhills and the first well on the “Point” was of the kind to whet the\r\nappetite for more. Bleakley & Egbert pocketed a keg of cold-cash from\r\ntheir wells and the royalty paid by lessees. Daniel Grimm’s production\r\nput him in the van of Franklin oilmen. He came to the town in 1861, had\r\na dry-goods store in partnership with the late William A. Horton and in\r\n1869 drilled his first well. W. J. Mattem and Edward Rial & Son had a\r\nrich slice. The foundation of a dozen fortunes was laid on the “Point,”\r\nwhich yields a few barrels daily, although only a shadow of its former\r\nself. From the western end of the hill thousands of tons of a peculiar\r\nshale have been manufactured into paving-brick, the hardest and toughest\r\nin America. A million dollars would not pay for the oil taken from the\r\nhill that found no takers at fifteen-hundred!\r\n\r\nDewoody, over whose grave the storms of a dozen winters have blown, was\r\na singular character. He cared not a continental for style and was\r\nindependent in speech and behavior. Bagging a term in the Legislature as\r\na Democratic-Greenbacker, his rugged honesty was proof against the\r\nallurements of the lobbyists, jobbers and heelers who disgrace common\r\ndecency. His most remarkable act was a violent assault on the\r\nTramp-Bill, a measure cruel as the laws of Draco, which Rhoads of\r\nCarlisle contrived to pass. He paced the central aisle, spoke in the\r\nloudest key and gesticulated fiercely. Tossing his long auburn hair like\r\na lion’s mane, he wound up his torrent of denunciation with terrible\r\nemphasis: “If Jesus Christ were on earth this monstrous bill would jerk\r\nhim as a vagrant and dump him into the lock-up!”\r\n\r\nGradually developments crept north and east. The Galloway—its Dolly\r\nVarden well was a daisy—Lamberton and McCalmont farms were riddled with\r\nholes that repaid the outlay lavishly. Henry F. James drilled scores of\r\npaying wells on these tracts. In his youth he circled the globe on\r\nwhaling voyages and learned coopering. Spending a few months at Pithole\r\nin 1865, he returned to Venango county in 1871, superintended the\r\nFranklin Pipe-Line five years and operated judiciously. He was active in\r\nagriculture and served three terms in the Legislature with distinguished\r\nfidelity. He defeated measures inimical to the oil-industry and promoted\r\nthe passage of the Marshall Bill, by which pipe-lines were permitted to\r\nbuy, sell or consolidate. This sensible law relieves pipe-lines in the\r\nolder districts, where the production is very light, from the necessity\r\nof maintaining separate equipments at a loss or ruining hundreds of\r\nwell-owners by tearing up the pipes for junk and depriving operators of\r\ntransportation. The late Casper Frank, William Painter—he was killed at\r\nhis wells—Dr. Fee, the Harpers, E. D. Yates and others extended the\r\nfield into Sugarcreek township. Elliott, Nesbett & Bell’s first well on\r\nthe Snyder farm, starting at thirty barrels and settling down to regular\r\nwork at fifteen, elongated the Galloway pool and brought adjoining lands\r\ninto play. Kunkel & Newhouse, Stock & Co., Mitchell & Parker, Crawford &\r\nDickey, Dr. Galbraith and M. O’Connor kept many sets of tools from\r\nrusting. The extension to the Carter and frontier-farms developed oil of\r\nlighter gravity, but a prime lubricator. Mrs. Harold, a Chicago lady,\r\ndreamed a certain plot, which she beheld distinctly, would yield\r\nheavy-oil in abundance. She visited Franklin, traversed the district a\r\nmile in advance of developed territory, saw the land of her dream,\r\nbargained for it, drilled wells and obtained “lashin’s of oil!” Still\r\nthere are bipeds in bifurcated garments who declare woman’s “sphere” is\r\nthe kitchen, with dish-washing, sock-darning and meal-getting as her\r\nhighest “rights!”\r\n\r\nJacob Sheasley, who came from Dauphin county in 1860 and branched into\r\noil in 1864, is the largest operator in the bailiwick. He drilled at\r\nPithole, Parker, Bradford, on all sides of Franklin and put down a\r\nhundred wells the last two years. He enlarged the boundaries of the\r\nlubricating section by leasing lands previously condemned and sinking\r\ntest-wells in 1893-4, with gratifying results. Rarely missing his guess\r\non territory, he has been almost invariably fortunate. His son, George\r\nR., has operated in Venango and Butler counties and owns a bunch of\r\ndesirable wells on Bully Hill, with his brother Charles as partner. The\r\nfather and two sons are “three of a kind” hard to beat.\r\n\r\nA mile north of Franklin, in February of 1870, the Surprise well on\r\nPatchel Run, a streamlet bearing the name of the earliest hat-maker,\r\nsurprised everybody by its output. It foamed and gassed and frothed\r\nexcessively, filling the pipe with oil and water. Throngs tramped the\r\nturnpike over the toilsome hill to look at the boiling, fuming tank into\r\nwhich the well belched its contents. “Good for four-hundred barrels” was\r\nthe verdict. A party of us hurried from Oil Creek to judge for\r\nourselves. Although the estimate was six times too great, a lease of\r\nadjacent lands would not be bad to take. Rev. Mr. Johns, retired pastor\r\nof the Presbyterian church at Spartansburg, Crawford county, had charge\r\nof the property. My acquaintance with Mr. Johns devolved upon me the\r\nduty of negotiating for the tract. He received me graciously and would\r\nbe pleased to lease twenty acres for one-half the oil and one-thousand\r\ndollars an acre bonus! Br’er John’s exalted notions soared far too high\r\nto be entertained seriously. The Surprise fizzled down to four or five\r\nbarrels in a week and the good minister—for twenty years he has been\r\nenjoying his treasure in heaven—never fingered a penny from his land\r\nsave the royalty of two or three small wells.\r\n\r\nMajor W. T. Baum has operated in the heavy-oil field thirty-two years,\r\nbeginning in 1864. He passed through the Pithole excitement and drilled\r\nlargely at Foster, Pleasantville, Scrubgrass, Bullion, Gas City,\r\nClarion, Butler and Tarkiln. His faith in Scrubgrass territory has been\r\nrecompensed richly. In 1894 he sank a well on the west bank of the\r\nAllegheny, opposite Kennerdell Station, in hope of a ten-barrel strike.\r\nIt pumped one-hundred-and-fifty barrels a day for months and it is doing\r\nfifty barrels to-day, with three more of similar caliber to keep it\r\ncompany! The Major’s persevering enterprise deserves the reward Dame\r\nFortune is bestowing. He owns the wells and lands on Patchel Run, which\r\nyield a pleasant revenue. Colonel J. H. Cain, Colonel L. H. Fassett and\r\nJ. W. Grant, all successful operators, have their wells in the vicinity.\r\nModern devices connect wells far apart, by coupling them with rods two\r\nto ten feet above ground, so that a single engine can pump thirty or\r\nforty in shallow territory. The downward stroke of one helps the upward\r\nstroke of the other, each pair nearly balancing. This enables the owners\r\nof small wells to pump them at the least expense. Heavy-oil has sold for\r\nyears at three-sixty to four dollars a barrel, consequently a\r\nquarter-barrel apiece from forty wells, handled by one man and engine,\r\nwould exceed the income from a quarter-million dollars salted down in\r\ngovernment bonds. It is worth traveling a long distance to stand on the\r\nhill and watch the pumping of Baum’s, Grimm’s, Cain’s, Grant’s,\r\nSheasley’s and James’s wells, some of them a mile from the power that\r\nsets the strings of connecting-rods in motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COL. JOHN H. CAIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE PLUMER SMITH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. S. M’MULLAN]\r\n\r\nOn Two-Mile Run, up the Allegheny two miles, W. S. McMullan drilled\r\nseveral wells in 1871-2. The product was the blackest of black oils,\r\nindicating a deposit separated from the main reservoir of the\r\nlubricating region. Subsequent operations demonstrated that a dry streak\r\nintervened. Captain L. L. Ray put down fair wells near the river in\r\n1894. Mr. McMullan resided at Rouseville and had valuable interests on\r\nOil Creek. He served a term in the State Senate, reflecting honor upon\r\nhimself and his constituents. A man of integrity and capacity, he could\r\nbe trusted implicitly. Fifteen years ago he removed to Missouri to\r\nengage in lumbering. Senator McMullan, Captain William Hasson, member of\r\nAssembly, and Judge Trunkey, who presided over the court and later\r\ngraced the Supreme Bench, were three Venango-county men in public life\r\nwhom railroad-passes never swerved from the path of duty. They refused\r\nall such favors and paid their way like gentlemen. If lawgivers and\r\njudges of their noble impress were the rule rather than the exception—“a\r\nconsummation devoutly to be wished”—grasping corporations would not own\r\nlegislatures and “drive a coach and four” through any enactment with\r\nimpunity.\r\n\r\nGeorge P. Smith’s tract of land between Franklin and Two-Mile Run netted\r\nhim a competence in oil and then sold for one-hundred-thousand dollars.\r\nMr. Smith dispenses liberally to charitable objects, assists his friends\r\nand uses his wealth properly. He owns his money, instead of letting it\r\nown him. He has traveled much, observed closely and profited by what he\r\nhas seen and read. He is verging on fourscore, his home is in\r\nPhiladelphia and “the world will be the better for his having lived in\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThe production of heavy-oil in 1875 aggregated\r\none-hundred-and-thirty-thousand barrels. In 1877 it dropped to\r\neighty-eight-thousand barrels and in 1878 to seventy thousand.\r\nThirteen-hundred wells produced sixty-thousand barrels in 1883. Taft &\r\nPayn’s pipe-line was laid in 1870 from the Egbert and Dewoody tracts to\r\nthe river, extended to Galloway in 1872 and combined with the Franklin\r\nline in 1878. The Producers’ Pipe-Line Company began to transport oil in\r\n1883. J. A. Harris, who died in 1894, had the first refinery in the\r\noil-regions in 1860. His plant was extremely primitive. Colonel J. P.\r\nHoover built the first refinery of note, which burned in the autumn of\r\n1861. Sims & Whitney had one in 1861 and the Norfolk Oil-Works were\r\nestablished the same year, below the Allegheny bridge. Samuel Spencer,\r\nof Scranton, expended thirty-thousand dollars on the Keystone Oil-Works,\r\nnear the cemetery, in 1864. Nine refineries, most of them running the\r\nlighter oils, were operated in 1854-5, after which the business\r\ncollapsed for years. Dr. Tweddle, a Pittsburg refiner who had suffered\r\nby fire, organized a company in 1872 to start the Eclipse Works. At\r\ndifferent periods many of the local operators have been interested in\r\nrefining, now the leading Franklin industry.\r\n\r\nFor some time heavy-oil was used principally in its natural state. At\r\nlength improvements of great value were devised, out of which have grown\r\nthe oil-works devoted solely to the manufacture of lubricants. Among\r\nthese the most important and successful was that adopted in 1869 by\r\nCharles Miller, of Franklin, protected by letters-patent of the United\r\nStates and since by patents covering the complete method. Besides\r\nimprovements in the method of manufacturing, he recognized the value of\r\nlead-oxide as an ingredient in lubricating oils and a patent was secured\r\nfor the combination of whale-oil, oxide of lead and petroleum. The\r\nGreat-Northern Oil-Company, once a big organization, had built a\r\nrefinery in 1865 on the north bank of French Creek, below the Evans\r\nWell, and leased it in 1868 to Colonel Street. In May of 1869 Mr. Miller\r\nand John Coon purchased the Point Lookout Oil-Works, as the refinery was\r\ncalled, Street retiring. The total tankage was one-thousand barrels and\r\nthe daily manufacturing capacity scarcely one-hundred. The new firm, of\r\nwhich R. L. Cochran became a member in July, pushed the business with\r\ncharacteristic energy, doubling the plant and extending the trade in all\r\ndirections. Mr. Cochran withdrew in January of 1870, R. H. Austin buying\r\nhis interest. The following August fire destroyed the works, entailing\r\nsevere loss. A calamity that would have disheartened most men seemed\r\nonly to imbue the partners with fresh vigor. Colonel Henry B. Plumer, a\r\nwealthy citizen of Franklin, entered the firm and the Dale light-oil\r\nrefinery, a half-mile up the creek, was bought and remodeled throughout.\r\nReorganized on a solid basis as the “Galena Oil-Works,” a name destined\r\nto gain world-wide reputation, within one month from the fire the new\r\nestablishment, its buildings and entire equipment changed and adapted to\r\nthe treatment of heavy-oil, was running to its full capacity night and\r\nday! Such enterprise and pluck augured happily for the future and they\r\nhave been rewarded abundantly.\r\n\r\nOrders poured in more rapidly than ever. The local demand spread to the\r\nadjoining districts. Customers once secured were sure to stay. In\r\naddition to the excellence of the product, there was a vim about the\r\nbusiness and its management that inspired confidence and won patronage.\r\nMessrs. Coon, Austin and Plumer disposed of their interest, at a\r\nhandsome figure, to the Standard Oil Company in 1878. The Galena\r\nOil-Works, Limited, was chartered and continued the business, with Mr.\r\nMiller as president. Increasing demands necessitated frequent\r\nenlargements of the works, which now occupy five acres of ground. Every\r\nappliance that ingenuity and experience can suggest has been provided,\r\nsecuring uniform grades of oil with unfailing precision.\r\n\r\nThe machinery and appurtenances are the best money and skill can supply.\r\nThe same sterling traits that distinguished the smaller firm have all\r\nalong marked the progress of the newer and larger enterprise. The\r\nstandard of its products is always strictly first-class, hence patrons\r\nare never disappointed in the quality of any of the celebrated Galena\r\nbrands of “Engine,” “Coach,” “Car,” “Machinery,” or “Lubricating” oils.\r\nSteadfast adherence to this cardinal principle has borne its legitimate\r\nfruit. Railway-oils are manufactured exclusively. The daily capacity is\r\nthree-thousand barrels. “Galena Oils” are used on _over ninety per\r\ncent._ of the railway-mileage of the United States, Canada and Mexico.\r\nSuch patronage has never before been gained by any one establishment and\r\nit is the result of positive merit. The Franklin district furnishes more\r\nand better lubricating oil than all the rest of the continent and the\r\nGalena treatment brings it to the highest measure of perfection. Reflect\r\nfor a moment upon the enormous expansion of the Galena Works and see\r\nwhat earnest, faithful, intelligent effort and straightforward dealing\r\nmay accomplish.\r\n\r\nThe first three railroads that tried the “Galena Oils” in 1869 have used\r\nnone other since. Could stronger proof of their excellence be desired?\r\nIt was a pleasing novelty for railway-managers to find a lubricant that\r\nwould neither freeze in winter nor dissipate in summer and they made\r\nhaste to profit by the experience. The severest tests served but to\r\nplace it far beyond all competition. At twenty degrees below zero it\r\nwould not congeal, while the fiercest heat of the tropical sun affected\r\nit hardly a particle. As the natural consequence it speedily superseded\r\nall others on the principal railroads of the country. The axles of the\r\nmagnificent Pullman and Wagner coaches on the leading lines have their\r\nfriction reduced to the minimum by “Galena Oil.” It adds immeasurably to\r\nthe smoothness and speed of railway-travel between the Atlantic and the\r\nPacific, from Maine to the Isthmus, from British Columbia to Florida.\r\nPassengers detained by a “hot box” and annoyed by the fumes of rancid\r\ngrease frying in the trucks beneath their feet may be certain that the\r\noffending railways _do not_ use “Galena Oil.” The “Galena” is not\r\nconstructed on that plan, but stands alone and unapproachable as the\r\nfinest lubricator of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThis is a record-breaking age. The world’s record for fast time on a\r\nrailroad was again captured from the English on September\r\neleventh, 1895. The New-York-Central train, which left New\r\nYork that morning, accomplished the trip to Buffalo at the\r\ngreatest speed for a continuous journey of any train over any\r\nrailroad in the world. The distance—four-hundred-and-thirty-six\r\nmiles—was covered in four-hundred-and-seven minutes, a rate of\r\nsixty-four-and-one-third miles per hour. Until that feat the English\r\nrecord of sixty-three-and-one-fifth miles an hour for five-hundred miles\r\nwas the fastest. In other words, the American train of four heavy cars,\r\nhauled to Albany by engine No. 999, the famous World’s Fair locomotive,\r\nsmashed the English record more than a mile an hour, in the teeth of a\r\nstiff head-wind. Father Time, who has insisted for many years that\r\ntravelers spend at least twenty-four hours on the journey between\r\nChicago and New York, received a fatal shock on October twenty-fourth,\r\n1895. Two men who left Chicago at three-thirty in the morning visited\r\nfive theatres in New York that night! A special New-York-Central train,\r\nwith Vice-President Webb and a small party of Lake-Shore officials, ran\r\nthe nine-hundred-and-eighty miles in seventeen-and-three-quarter hours,\r\naveraging sixty-five miles an hour to Buffalo, beating all previous\r\nlong-distance runs. For the first time copies of Chicago newspapers,\r\nbrought by gentlemen on the train, were seen in New York on the day of\r\ntheir publication. Every axle, every journal, every box, every wheel of\r\nboth these trains, from the front of the locomotive to the rear of the\r\nhind-coach, was lubricated with “Galena Oil.”\r\n\r\nLater a train in Scotland, keeping step with the oatmeal-and-haggis fad\r\nthat has deluged the land with Highland-dialect tales, snatched the\r\ngarland by adding a mile or more to the Central’s achievement. The\r\nScottish triumph was very brief. “Ian McLaren,” Barree and Crockett\r\nmight shine in literature, but no foreign line could be permitted to fix\r\nthe record for railroad-speed. Engineer Charles H. Fahl, of the Reading\r\nsystem, believed American railways to be the best on earth and backed up\r\nhis opinion by solid proof. During the past summer he ran the famous\r\nflyer between Camden and Atlantic City the entire season on time every\r\ntrip. The train, scheduled to travel the fifty-six miles in fifty-two\r\nminutes, always started at least two minutes late, owing to the\r\nferryboats not connecting promptly. Yet Engineer Fahl made up this loss\r\nand reached Atlantic City a trifle ahead of time, without missing once.\r\nThe trips averaged _forty-eight minutes_, or a fraction above\r\n_sixty-nine miles an hour_! This was not one experimental test, but a\r\nregular run day after day the whole season, generally with six\r\npassenger-coaches crowded from end to end. Week in and week out the\r\nflyer sped across the sandy plains of New Jersey, with never a skip or a\r\nbreak, at the pace which placed the record of Train 25, of the\r\nAtlantic-City branch of the Reading Railroad, upon the top rung of the\r\nladder. This performance, unequaled in railway-history at home or\r\nabroad, brought Engineer Fahl a commendatory letter from Vice-President\r\nTheodore Voorhees. It was rendered possible only by the exclusive use,\r\non locomotive and coaches alike, of the Galena Oils, which prevented the\r\nhot-journals and excessive friction that are fatal to speed-records.\r\n\r\nThe works are situated in the very heart of the heavy-oil district. Two\r\nrailroads, with a third in prospect, and a paved street front the\r\nspacious premises. The main building is of brick, covering about an acre\r\nand devoted chiefly to the handling of oil for manufacture or in course\r\nof preparation, the repairing and painting of barrels and the\r\naccommodation of the engines and machinery. To the rear stands a\r\nsubstantial brick-structure, containing the steam-boilers, the\r\nelectric-light outfit and the huge agitators in which the oil is\r\ntreated. Big pumps next force the fluid into large vessels, where it is\r\nsubmitted to a variety of special processes, which finally leave it\r\nready for the consumer. A dozen iron-tanks, each holding many thousand\r\nbarrels, receive and store crude to supply the works for months. As this\r\nis piped directly from the wells the largest orders are filled with the\r\nutmost dispatch. Nothing is lacking that can ensure superiority. The\r\nhighest wages are paid and every employee is an American citizen or\r\nproposes to become one. The men are regarded as rational, responsible\r\nbeings, with souls to save and bodies to nourish, and treated in\r\naccordance with the Golden Rule. They are well-fed, well-housed,\r\nprosperous and contented. A strike, or a demand for higher wages or\r\nshorter hours, is unknown in the history of this model institution. Is\r\nit surprising that each year adds to its vast trade and wonderful\r\npopularity? The unrivalled “Galena Oil-Works,” of Franklin, Venango\r\ncounty, Pennsylvania, must be ranked among the most noteworthy\r\nrepresentative industries of Uncle Sam’s splendid domain.\r\n\r\n                Have you a somewhat cranky wife,\r\n                  Whose temper’s apt to broil?\r\n                To ease the matrimonial strife\r\n                Just lubricate when trouble’s rife—\r\n                  Pour on Galena Oil!\r\n\r\n                Has life some rusty hinge or joint\r\n                  That vexes like a boil,\r\n                And always sure to disappoint?\r\n                The hindrance to success anoint\r\n                  As with Galena Oil!\r\n\r\n                Does business seem to jar and creak,\r\n                  Despite long years of toil,\r\n                Till wasted strength has left you weak?\r\n                Reduce the friction, so to speak—\r\n                  Apply Galena Oil!\r\n\r\n                Are your affairs all run aground,\r\n                  The cause of sad turmoil?\r\n                To see again “the wheels go ’wound,”\r\n                Smooth the rough spots wherever found—\r\n                  Soak in Galena Oil!\r\n\r\nThe Signal Oil-Works, Franklin, manufacture Sibley’s Perfection\r\nValve-Oil for locomotive-cylinders and Perfection Signal-Oil. More than\r\ntwenty-five years ago Joseph C. Sibley commenced experimenting with\r\npetroleum-oils for use in steam-cylinders under high pressure. He found\r\nthat where the boiler-pressure was not in excess of sixty pounds the\r\nproper lubrication of a steam-cylinder with petroleum was a matter of\r\nlittle or no difficulty. With increase in pressure came increase in\r\ntemperature. As a result the oil vaporized and passed through the\r\nexhaust. The destruction of steam-chests and cylinders through fatty\r\nacids incident to tallow, or tallow and lard-oils, cost millions of\r\ndollars annually; but it was held as a cardinal point in mechanical\r\nengineering that these were the only proper steam-lubricants. Mr. Sibley\r\ncarried on his experiments for years. He conversed with leading\r\nsuperintendents-of-machinery in the United States and with leading\r\nchemists. Almost invariably he was laughed at when asserting his\r\ndetermination to produce a product of petroleum, free from fatty acids,\r\ncapable of better lubrication even than the tallow then in use. Many of\r\nhis friends in the oil-business, who thought they understood the nature\r\nof petroleum, expressed the deepest sympathy with Mr. Sibley’s\r\nhallucination. Amid partial successes, interspersed with many failures,\r\nhe continued the experiments. So incredulous were chemists and\r\nsuperintendents-of-machinery, so fearful of disasters to their machinery\r\nthrough the use of such a compound, that he had in many instances to\r\nguarantee to assume any damages which might occur to a locomotive\r\nthrough its use. He rode thousands of miles upon locomotives, watching\r\nthe use of the oil, daily doubling the distance made by engineers.\r\nSuccess at last crowned his efforts and the Perfection Valve-Oil has\r\nbeen for nearly twenty years the standard lubricant of valves and\r\ncylinders. To-day there is scarcely a locomotive in the United States\r\nthat does not use some preparation of petroleum and the steam-chests and\r\ncylinders of _more than three-fourths_ of all in the United States are\r\nlubricated with Perfection Valve-Oil.\r\n\r\nThe results have been astounding. Destruction of steam-joints by fatty\r\nacids from valve-lubricants is now an unknown thing. Not only this, but\r\nas a lubricant the Perfection Valve-Oil has proved itself so much\r\nsuperior that, where valve-seats required facing on an average once in\r\nsixty days, they do not now require facing on an average once in two\r\nyears. The steam-pressure carried upon the boilers at that time rarely\r\nexceeded one-hundred-and-twenty pounds. With the increase of pressure\r\nand the corresponding increase of temperature it was found next to\r\nimpossible to properly lubricate the valves and cylinders to prevent\r\ncutting. The superintendent-of-machinery of a leading American railway\r\nsent for Mr. Sibley at one time, told him that he proposed to build\r\npassenger-locomotives carrying one-hundred-and-eighty pounds pressure\r\nand asked if he would undertake to lubricate the valves and cylinders\r\nunder that pressure. The reply was: “Go ahead. We will guarantee perfect\r\nlubrication to a pressure very much higher than that.” And to-day the\r\nhigher type of passenger-locomotives carry one-hundred-and-eighty pounds\r\npressure regularly.\r\n\r\nWhen it was clearly demonstrated that the Perfection Valve-Oil was a\r\nsuccess, oil-men who had pronounced it impossible and had been backed in\r\ntheir opinion by noted chemists commenced to make oils similar to it in\r\nappearance. While many of them may have much confidence in their own\r\nproduct, the highest testimonial ever paid to Perfection Valve-Oil is\r\nthat no competitor claims he has its superior. Some urge their product\r\nwith the assurance that it is the equal of Perfection Valve-Oil, thus\r\nunconsciously paying the highest tribute possible to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe works also make Perfection Signal-Oil for use in railway-lamps and\r\nlanterns. Since 1869 this oil has been before the public. It is in daily\r\nuse in more than three-fourths of the railway-lanterns of the United\r\nStates and it is the proud boast of Mr. Sibley that, during that time,\r\nthere has never occurred an accident which has cost either a human limb\r\nor life or the destruction of one penny’s worth of property, through the\r\nfailure of this oil to perform its work perfectly. Making but the two\r\nproducts, Valve and Signal-Oils, catering to no other than\r\nrailroad-trade, studying carefully the demands of the service, keeping\r\nin touch with the latest developments of locomotive-engineering and\r\nthoroughly acquainted with the properties of all petroleum in\r\nPennsylvania, the company may well believe that, granted the possession\r\nof equal natural abilities with competitors, under the circumstances it\r\nis entitled to lead all others in the production of these two grades of\r\noils for railroad-use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHARLES MILLER.\r\n  JOSEPH C. SIBLEY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHon. Charles Miller, president of the Galena Oil-Works, and Hon. Joseph\r\nC. Sibley, president of the Signal Oil-Works, are brothers-in-law and\r\nproprietors of the great stock-farms of Miller & Sibley. Mr. Miller is\r\nof Huguenot ancestry, born in Alsace, France, in 1843. The family came\r\nto this country in 1854, settling on a farm near Boston, Erie county,\r\nNew York. At thirteen Charles clerked one year in the village-store for\r\nthirty-five dollars and board. He clerked in Buffalo at seventeen for\r\none-hundred-and-seventy-five dollars, without board. In 1861 he enlisted\r\nin the New-York National Guard. In 1863 he was mustered into the United\r\nStates service and married at Springville, N. Y., to Miss Ann Adelaide\r\nSibley, eldest child of Dr. Joseph C. Sibley. In 1864 he commenced\r\nbusiness for himself, in the store in which he had first clerked, with\r\nhis own savings of two-hundred dollars and a loan of two-thousand from\r\nDr. Sibley. In 1866 he sold the store and removed to Franklin. Forming a\r\npartnership with John Coon of Buffalo, the firm carried on a large\r\ndry-goods house until 1869, when a patent for lubricating oil and a\r\nrefinery were purchased and the store was closed out at heavy loss. The\r\nrefinery burned down the next year, new partners were taken in and in\r\n1878 the business was organized in its present form as “The Galena\r\nOil-Works, Limited.” The entire management was given Mr. Miller, who had\r\nbuilt up an immense trade and retained his interest in the works. He\r\ndeals directly with consumers. Since 1870 his business-trips have\r\naveraged five days a week and fifty-thousand miles a year of travel. No\r\nman has a wider acquaintance and more personal friends among\r\nrailroad-officials. His journeys cover the United States and Mexico.\r\nWherever he may be, in New Orleans or San Francisco, on the train or in\r\nthe hotel, conferring with a Vanderbilt or the humblest manager of an\r\nobscure road, receiving huge orders or aiding a deserving cause, he is\r\nalways the same genial, magnetic, generous exemplar of practical belief\r\nin “the universal fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.”\r\n\r\nMajor Miller is one whom money does not spoil. He is the master, not the\r\nservant, of his wealth. He uses it to extend business, to foster\r\nenterprise, to further philanthropy, to alleviate distress and to\r\npromote the comfort and happiness of all about him. His benefactions\r\nkeep pace with his increasing prosperity. He is ever foremost in good\r\ndeeds. He gives thousands of dollars yearly to worthy objects, to the\r\nneedy, to churches, to schools, to missions and to advance the general\r\nwelfare. In 1889 he established a free night-school for his employés and\r\nthe youth of Franklin, furnishing spacious rooms with desks and\r\napparatus and engaging four capable teachers. This school has trained\r\nhundreds of young men for positions as accountants, book-keepers,\r\nstenographers and clerks. The First Baptist church, which he assisted in\r\norganizing, is the object of his special regard. He bore a large share\r\nof the cost of the brick-edifice, the lecture-room and the parsonage. He\r\nand Mr. Sibley have donated the massive pipe-organ, maintained the\r\nsuperb choir, paid a good part of the pastor’s salary, erected a\r\nbranch-church and supported the only services in the Third Ward. For\r\ntwenty-five years Mr. Miller has been superintendent of the\r\nSabbath-school, which has grown to a membership of six-hundred. His\r\nBible-class of three-hundred men is equalled in the state only by John\r\nWanamaker’s, in Philadelphia, and James McCormick’s, in Harrisburg. The\r\ninstruction is scriptural, pointed and business-like, with no taint of\r\nbigotry or sectarianism. No matter how far away Saturday may find him,\r\nthe faithful teacher never misses the class that is “the apple of his\r\neye,” if it be possible to reach home. Often he has hired an engine to\r\nbring him through on Saturday night, in order to meet the adult pupils\r\nof all denominations who flock to hear his words of wisdom and\r\nencouragement. Alike in conversation, teaching and public-speaking he\r\npossesses the faculty of interesting his listeners and imparting\r\nsomething new. He has raised the fallen, picked poor fellows out of the\r\ngutter, rescued the perishing and set many wanderers in the straight\r\npath. Not a few souls, “plucked as brands from the burning,” owe their\r\nsalvation to the kindly sympathy and assistance of this earnest layman.\r\nEternity alone will reveal the incalculable benefit of his night-school,\r\nhis Bible-class, his church-work, his charity, his personal appeals to\r\nthe erring and his unselfish life to the community and the world.\r\n\r\n      “No duty could overtask him, no need his will outrun;\r\n      Or ever our lips could ask him, his hand the work had done.”\r\n\r\nTwice Mr. Miller served as mayor of Franklin. Repeatedly has he declined\r\nnominations to high offices, private affairs demanding his time and\r\nattention. He is president or director of a score of commercial and\r\nindustrial companies, with factories, mines and works in eight states.\r\nHe has been president time after time of the Northwestern Association of\r\nPennsylvania of the Grand Army of the Republic, Ordnance-Officer and\r\nAssistant Adjutant-General of the Second Brigade of Pennsylvania and\r\nCommander of Mays Post. He is a leading spirit in local enterprises. He\r\nenjoys his beautiful home and the society of his wife and children and\r\nfriends. He prizes good horses, smokes good cigars and tells good\r\nstories. In him the wage-earner and the breadwinner have a steadfast\r\nhelper, willing to lighten their burden and to better their condition.\r\nIn short, Charles Miller is a typical American, plucky, progressive,\r\nenergetic and invincible, with a heart to feel, genius to plan and\r\ntalent to execute the noblest designs.\r\n\r\nHon. Joseph Crocker Sibley, eldest son of Dr. Joseph Crocker Sibley, was\r\nborn at Friendship, N.Y., in 1850. His father’s death obliging him to\r\ngive up a college-course for which he had prepared, in 1866 he came to\r\nFranklin to clerk in Miller & Coon’s dry-goods store. From that time his\r\nbusiness interests and Mr. Miller’s were closely allied. In 1870 he\r\nmarried Miss Metta E. Babcock, daughter of Simon M. Babcock, of\r\nFriendship. He was agent of the Galena Oil-Works at Chicago for two\r\nyears, losing his effects and nearly losing his life in the terrible\r\nfire that devastated that city. His business-success may be said to date\r\nfrom 1873, when he returned to Franklin. After many experiments he\r\nproduced a signal-oil superior in light, safety and cold-test to any in\r\nuse. The Signal Oil-Works were established, with Mr. Sibley as president\r\nand the proprietors of the Galena Oil-Works, whose plant manufactured\r\nthe new product, as partners. Next he compounded a valve-oil for\r\nlocomotives, free from the bad qualities of animal-oils, which is now\r\nused on three-fourths of the railway mileage of the United States.\r\n\r\nEvery newspaper-reader in the land has heard of the remarkable\r\nCongressional fight of 1892 in the Erie-Crawford district. Both counties\r\nwere overwhelmingly Republican. People learned with surprise that Hon.\r\nJoseph C. Sibley, a resident of another district, had accepted the\r\ninvitation of a host of good citizens, by whom he was selected as the\r\nonly man who could lead them to victory over the ring, to try\r\nconclusions with the nominee of the ruling party, who had stacks of\r\nmoney, the entire machine, extensive social connections, religious\r\nassociations—he was a preacher—and a regular majority of five-thousand\r\nto bank upon. Some wiseacres shook their heads gravely and predicted\r\ndisaster. Such persons understood neither the resistless force of\r\nquickened public sentiment nor the sterling qualities of the candidate\r\nfrom Venango county. Democrats, Populists and Prohibitionists endorsed\r\nSibley. He conducted a campaign worthy of Henry Clay. Multitudes crowded\r\nto hear and see a man candid enough to deliver his honest opinions with\r\nthe boldness of “Old Hickory.” The masses knew of Mr. Sibley’s courage,\r\nsagacity and success in business, but they were unprepared to find so\r\nsturdy a defender of their rights. His manly independence, ringing\r\ndenunciations of wrong, grand simplicity and incisive logic aroused\r\nunbounded enthusiasm. The tide in favor of the fearless advocate of\r\nfair-play for the lowliest creature no earthly power could stem. His\r\nopponent was buried out of sight and Sibley was elected by a sweeping\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nMr. Sibley’s course in Congress amply met the expectations of his most\r\nardent supporters. The prestige of his great victory, added to his\r\npersonal magnetism and rare geniality, at the very outset gave him a\r\nmeasure of influence few members ever attain. During the extra-session\r\nhe expressed his views with characteristic vigor. A natural leader,\r\nclose student and keen observer, he did not wait for somebody to give\r\nhim the cue before putting his ideas on record. In the silver-discussion\r\nhe bore a prominent part, opposing resolutely the repeal of the Sherman\r\nact. His wonderful speech “set the ball rolling” for those who declined\r\nto follow the administration program. The House was electrified by\r\nSibley’s effort. Throughout his speech of three hours he was honored\r\nwith the largest Congressional audience of the decade. Aisles, halls,\r\ngalleries and corridors were densely packed. Senators came from the\r\nother end of the Capitol to listen to the brave Pennsylvanian who dared\r\nplead for the white metal. For many years Mr. Sibley has been a close\r\nstudent of political and social economics and he so grouped his facts as\r\nto command the undivided attention and the highest respect of those who\r\nhonestly differed from him in his conclusions. Satire, pathos, bright\r\nwit and pungent repartee awoke in his hearers the strongest emotions,\r\nentrancing the bimetalists and giving their enemies a cold chill, as the\r\nstream of eloquence flowed from lips “untrained to flatter, to dissemble\r\nor to play the hypocrite.” Thenceforth the position of the\r\nrepresentative of the Twenty-sixth district was assured, despite the\r\nassaults of hireling journals and discomfited worshippers of the golden\r\ncalf.\r\n\r\nHe took advanced ground on the Chinese question, delivering a speech\r\nreplete with patriotism and common-sense. An American by birth, habit\r\nand education, he prefers his own country to any other under the blue\r\nvault of heaven. The American workman he would protect from pauper\r\nimmigration and refuse to put on the European or Asiatic level. He\r\nstands up for American skill, American ingenuity, American labor and\r\nAmerican wages. Tariff for revenue he approves of, not a tariff to\r\ndiminish revenue or to enrich one class at the expense of all. The\r\ntiller of the soil, the mechanic, the coal-miner, the coke-burner and\r\nthe day-laborer have found him an outspoken champion of their cause.\r\nSmall wonder is it that good men and women of all creeds and parties\r\nhave abiding faith in Joseph C. Sibley and would fain bestow on him the\r\nhighest office in the nation’s gift.\r\n\r\nHuman nature is a queer medley and sometimes manifests streaks of envy\r\nand meanness in queer ways. Mr. Sibley’s motives have been impugned, his\r\nefforts belittled, his methods assailed and his neckties criticised by\r\nmen who could not understand his lofty character and purposes. The\r\ngenerous ex-Congressman must plead guilty to the charge of wearing\r\nclothes that fit him, of smoking decent cigars, of driving fine horses\r\nand of living comfortably. Of course it would be cheaper to buy\r\nhand-me-down misfits, to indulge in loud-smelling tobies, to walk or\r\nride muleback, to curry his own horses and let his wife do the washing\r\ninstead of hiring competent helpers. But he goes right ahead increasing\r\nhis business, improving his farms, developing American trotters and\r\nfurnishing work at the highest wages to willing hands in his factories,\r\nat his oil-wells, on his lands, in his barns and his hospitable home. He\r\ndispenses large sums in charity. His benevolence and enterprise reach\r\nfar beyond Pennsylvania. He does not hoard up money to loan it at\r\nexorbitant rates. As a matter of fact, from the hundreds of men he has\r\nhelped pecuniarily he never accepted one penny of interest. He has been\r\nmayor of Franklin, president of the Pennsylvania State-Dairymen’s\r\nAssociation, director of the American Jersey-Cattle Club and member of\r\nthe State Board of Agriculture. He is a brilliant talker, a profound\r\nthinker, a capital story-teller and a loyal friend. “May he live long\r\nand prosper!”\r\n\r\nMiller & Sibley’s Prospect-Hill Stock-Farm is one of the largest, best\r\nequipped and most favorably known in the world. Different farms\r\ncomprising the establishment include a thousand acres of land adjacent\r\nto Franklin and a farm, with stabling for two-hundred horses and the\r\nfinest kite-track in the United States, at Meadville. On one of these\r\nfarms is the first silo built west of the Allegheny mountains. Trotting\r\nstock, Jersey cattle, Shetland ponies and Angora goats of the highest\r\ngrades are bred. For Michael Angelo, when a calf six weeks old,\r\ntwelve-thousand-five-hundred dollars in cash were paid A. B. Darling,\r\nproprietor of the Fifth-Avenue Hotel, New York City. Animals of the best\r\nstrain were purchased, regardless of cost. In 1886 Mr. Sibley bought\r\nfrom Senator Leland Stanford, of California, for ten-thousand dollars,\r\nthe four-year-old trotting-stallion St. Bel. Seventy-five thousand were\r\noffered for him a few weeks before the famous sire of numerous\r\nprize-winners died. Cows that have broken all records for milk and\r\nbutter, and horses that have won the biggest purses on the leading\r\nrace-tracks of the country are the results of the liberal policy pursued\r\nat Prospect-Hill. Charles Marvin, the prince of horsemen, superintends\r\nthe trotting department and E. H. Sibley is manager of all the Miller &\r\nSibley interests. Hundreds of the choicest animals are raised every\r\nyear. Prospect-Hill Farm is one of the sights of Franklin and the\r\nenterprise represents an investment not far short of one-million\r\ndollars. Wouldn’t men like Charles Miller and Joseph C. Sibley sweep\r\naway the cobwebs, give business an impetus and infuse new life and new\r\nideas into any community?\r\n\r\nFranklin had tallied one for heavy-oil, but its resources were not\r\nexhausted. On October seventeenth, 1859, Colonel James P. Hoover, C. M.\r\nHoover and Vance Stewart began to drill on the Robert-Brandon—now the\r\nHoover—farm of three-hundred acres, in Sandycreek township, on the west\r\nbank of the Allegheny river, three miles south of Franklin. They found\r\noil on December twenty-first, the well yielding one-hundred barrels a\r\nday! This pretty Christmas gift was another surprise. Owing to its\r\ndistance from “springs” and the two wells—Drake and Evans—already\r\nproducing, the stay-in-the-rut element felt confident that the Hoover\r\nWell would not “amount to a hill of beans.” It was “piling Ossa on\r\nPelion” for the well to produce, from the _second sand_, oil with\r\nproperties adapted to illumination and lubrication. The Drake was for\r\nlight, the Evans for grease and the Hoover combined the two in part.\r\nWhere and when was this variegated dissimilarity to cease? Perhaps its\r\nlatest phase is to come shortly. Henry F. James is beginning a well\r\nsouth-west of town, on the N. B. Myers tract, between a sweet and a sour\r\nspring. Savans, scientists, beer-drinkers, tee-totalers and\r\noil-operators are on the ragged edge of suspense, some hoping, some\r\nfearing, some praying that James may tap a perennial fount of creamy\r\n’alf-and-’alf.\r\n\r\nOnce at a drilling-well on the “Point” the tools dropped suddenly. The\r\ndriller relieved the tension on his rope and let the tools down slowly.\r\nThey descended six or eight feet! The bare thought of a crevice of such\r\ndimensions paralyzed the knight of the temper-screw, all the more that\r\nthe hole was not to the first sand. What a lake of oil must underlie\r\nthat derrick! He drew up the tools. They were dripping amber fluid,\r\nwhich had a flavor quite unlike petroleum. Did his nose deceive him? It\r\nwas the aroma of beer! A lick of the stuff confirmed the nasal\r\ndiagnosis—it had the taste of beer! The alarm was sounded and the\r\nsand-pump run down. It came up brimming over with beer! Ten times the\r\ntrip was repeated with the same result. Think of an ocean of the\r\ndelicious, foamy, appetizing German beverage! Word was sent to the\r\nowners of the well, who ordered the tubing to be put in. They tried to\r\nfigure how many breweries the production of their well would retire.\r\nPumping was about to begin, in presence of a party of impatient, thirsty\r\nspectators, when an excited Teuton, blowing and puffing, was seen\r\napproaching at a breakneck pace. Evidently he had something on his mind.\r\n“Gott in Himmel!” he shrieked, “you vas proke mit Grossman’s vault!” The\r\nmystery was quickly explained. Philip Grossman, the brewer, had cut a\r\ntunnel a hundred feet into the hill-side to store his liquid-stock in a\r\ncool place. The well chanced to be squarely over this tunnel, the roof\r\nof which the tools pierced and stove in the head of a tun of beer!\r\nWorkmen who came for a load were astonished to discover one end of a\r\nstring of tubing dangling in the tun. It dawned upon them that the\r\ndrillers three-hundred feet above must have imagined they struck a\r\ncrevice and a messenger speeded to the well. The saddened crowd slinked\r\noff, muttering words that would not look nice in print. The tubing was\r\nwithdrawn, the hogshead was shoved aside, the tools were again swung and\r\ntwo weeks later the well was pumping thirty barrels a day of\r\nunmistakable heavy-oil.\r\n\r\nThe Hoover strike fed the flame the Evans Well had kindled. Lands in the\r\nneighborhood were in demand on any terms the owners might impose. From\r\nFranklin to the new well, on both sides of the Allegheny, was the\r\nfavorite choice, on a theory that a pool connected the deposits. Leases\r\nwere snapped up at one-half royalty and a cash-bonus. Additional wells\r\non the Hoover rivaled No. 1, which produced gamely for four years. The\r\ntools were stuck in cleaning it out and a new well beside it started at\r\nsixty barrels. The “Big-Emma Vein” was really an artery to which for\r\nyears “whoa, Emma!” did not apply. Bissell & Co. and the Cameron\r\nPetroleum-Company secured control of the property, on which fifteen\r\nwells were producing two-hundred barrels ten years from the advent of\r\nthe Hoover & Vance. Harry Smith, a city-father, is operating on the\r\ntract and drilling paying wells at reasonable intervals. Colonel James\r\nP. Hoover died on February fourth, 1871, aged sixty-nine. Born in Centre\r\ncounty, he settled in the southern part of Clarion, was appointed by\r\nGovernor Porter in 1839 Prothonotary of Venango county and removed to\r\nFranklin. The people elected him to the same office for three years and\r\nState-Senator in 1844. The Canal-Commissioners in 1851 appointed him\r\ncollector of the tolls at Hollidaysburg, Blair county, for five years.\r\nHe filled these positions efficiently, strict adherence to principle and\r\na high sense of duty marking his whole career. The esteem and confidence\r\nhe enjoyed all through his useful life were attested by universal regret\r\nat his death and the largest funeral ever witnessed in Franklin. His\r\nestimable widow survived Colonel Hoover twenty years, dying at the\r\nresidence of her son-in-law, Arnold Plumer, in Minnesota. Their son, C.\r\nM. Hoover, ex-sheriff of the county, has been interested in the street\r\nrailway. Vance Stewart, who owned a farm near the lower river-bridge,\r\nremoved to Greenville and preceded his wife and several children, one of\r\nthem Rev. Orlando V. Stewart, to the tomb. Another son, James Stewart,\r\nwas a prominent member of the Erie bar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B. E. SWAN.]\r\n\r\nThe opening months of 1860 were decidedly lively on the Cochran Farm, in\r\nCranberry township, opposite the Hoover. The first well, the Keystone,\r\non the flats above where the station now stands, was a second-sander of\r\nthe hundred-barrel class. The first oil sold for fourteen dollars a\r\nbarrel, at which rate land-owners and operators were not in danger of\r\nbankruptcy or the poor-house. Fourteen-hundred dollars a day from a\r\nthree-inch hole would have seemed too preposterous for Munchausen before\r\nthe Pennsylvania oil-regions demonstrated that “truth is stranger than\r\nfiction.” The Monitor, Raymond, Williams, McCutcheon and other wells\r\nkept the production at a satisfactory figure. Dale & Morrow, Horton &\r\nSon, Hoover & Co., George R. Hobby, Cornelius Fulkerson and George S.\r\nMcCartney were early operators. B. E. Swan located on the farm in May of\r\n1865 and drilled numerous fair wells. He has operated there for\r\nthirty-two years, sticking to the second-sand territory with a tenacity\r\nequal to the “perseverance of the saints.” When thousands of producers,\r\nimitating the dog that let go the bone to grasp the shadow in the water,\r\nquit their enduring small wells to take their chance of larger ones in\r\ncostlier fields, he did not lose his head and add another to the\r\nfinancial wrecks that strewed the greasian shore. Appreciating his moral\r\nstamina, his steadfastness and ability, Mr. Swan’s friends insist that\r\nhe shall serve the public in some important office. Walter Pennell—his\r\nfather made the first car-wheels—and W. P. Smith drilled several snug\r\nwells on the uplands, Sweet & Shaffer following with six or eight.\r\nEighteen wells are producing on the tract, which contains\r\none-hundred-and-forty acres and has had only two dry-holes in its\r\nthirty-six years of active developments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER COCHRAN.]\r\n\r\nAlexander Cochran, for forty years owner of the well-known farm bearing\r\nhis name, is one of the oldest citizens of Franklin. Winning his way in\r\nthe world by sheer force of character, scrupulous integrity and a fixed\r\ndetermination to succeed, he is in the highest and best sense a\r\nself-made man. Working hard in boyhood to secure an education, he taught\r\nschool, clerked in general stores, studied law and was twice elected\r\nProthonotary without asking one voter for his support. In these days of\r\nbutton-holing, log-rolling, wire-pulling, buying and soliciting votes\r\nthis is a record to recall with pride. Marrying Miss Mary Bole—her\r\nfather removed from Lewistown to Franklin seventy-five years ago—he\r\nbuilt the home at “Cochran Spring” that is one of the land-marks of the\r\ntown and established a large dry-goods store. As his means permitted he\r\nbought city-lots, put up dwelling-houses and about 1852 paid\r\nsixteen-hundred dollars for the farm in Cranberry township for which in\r\n1863, after it had yielded a fortune, he refused seven-hundred-thousand!\r\nThe farm was in two blocks. A neighbor expostulated with him for buying\r\nthe second piece, saying it was “foolish to waste money that way.” In\r\n1861, when the same neighbor wished to mortgage his land for a loan, he\r\nnaively remarked: “Well, Aleck, I guess I was the fool, not you, in\r\n1852.” A man of broad views, Mr. Cochran freely grants to others the\r\nliberality of thought he claims for himself. A hater of cant and sham\r\nand hollow pretence, he believes less in musty creeds than kindly deeds,\r\nmore in giving loaves than tracts to the hungry, and takes no stock in\r\nreligion that thinks only of dodging punishment in the next world and\r\nfails to help humanity in this. In the dark days of low-priced oil and\r\ndepressed trade, he would accept neither interest from his debtors nor\r\nroyalty from the operators who had little wells on his farm. He never\r\nhounded the sheriff on a hapless borrower, foreclosed a mortgage to grab\r\na coveted property or seized the chattels of a struggling victim to\r\nsatisfy a shirt-tail note. There is no shred of the Pecksniff, the\r\nShylock or the Uriah-Heep in his anatomy. At fourscore he is hale and\r\nhearty, rides on horseback, cultivates his garden, attends to business,\r\nlikes a good play and keeps up with the literature of the day. The\r\nproductive oil-farm is now owned by his daughters, Mrs. J. J. McLaurin,\r\nof Harrisburg, and Mrs. George R. Sheasley, of Franklin. The proudest\r\neulogy he could desire is Alexander Cochran’s just desert: “The Poor\r\nMan’s Friend.”\r\n\r\nDown to Sandy Creek many wells were drilled from 1860 to 1865, producing\r\nfairly at an average depth of four-hundred-and-fifty to five-hundred\r\nfeet. These operations included the Miller, Smith and Pope farms, on the\r\nwest side of the river, and the Rice, Nicklin, Martin and Harmon, on the\r\neast side, all second-sand territory. North of the Cochran and the\r\nHoover work was pushed actively. George H. Bissell and Vance Stewart\r\nbored twelve or fifteen medium wells on the Stewart farm of two-hundred\r\nacres, which the Cameron Petroleum Company purchased in 1865 and Joseph\r\nDale operated for some years. It lies below the lower bridge, opposite\r\nthe Bleakley tract, from which a light production is still derived.\r\nAbove the Stewart are the Fuller and the Chambers farms, the latter\r\nextending to the Allegheny-Valley depot. Scores of eager operators\r\nthronged the streets of Franklin and drilled along the Allegheny. Joseph\r\nPowley and Charles Cowgill entered the lists in the Cranberry district.\r\nHenry M. Wilson and George Piagett veered into the township and sank a\r\nbevy of dry-holes to vary the monotony. That was a horse on Wilson, but\r\nhe got ahead of the game by a deal that won him the nicest territory on\r\nHorse Creek. Stirling Bonsall and Colonel Lewis—they’re dead now—were in\r\nthe thickest of the fray, with Captain Goddard, Philip Montgomery, Boyd,\r\nRoberts, Foster, Brown, Murphy and many more whom old-timers remember\r\npleasantly. Thomas King, whole-souled, genial “Tom”—no squarer man e’er\r\nowned a well or handled oil-certificates—and Captain Griffith were “a\r\ngood pair to draw to.” King has “crossed over,” as have most of the\r\nkindred spirits that dispelled the gloom in the sixties.\r\n\r\nColonel W. T. Pelton, nephew of Samuel J. Tilden, participated in the\r\nscenes of that exciting period. He lived at Franklin and drilled wells\r\non French Creek. He was a royal entertainer, shrewd in business, finely\r\neducated and polished in manner and address. He and his wife—a lovely\r\nand accomplished woman—were fond of society and gained hosts of friends.\r\nThey boarded at the United-States Hotel, where Mrs. Pelton died\r\nsuddenly. This affliction led Colonel Pelton to sell his oil-properties\r\nand abandon the oil-regions. Returning to New York, when next he came\r\ninto view as the active agent of his uncle in the secret negotiations\r\nthat grew out of the election of 1876, it was with a national fame. His\r\ndeath in 1880 closed a busy, promising career.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1864 a young man, black-haired, dark-eyed, an Apollo in\r\nform and strikingly handsome, arrived at Franklin and engaged rooms at\r\nMrs. Webber’s, on Buffalo street. The stranger had money, wore good\r\nclothes and presented a letter of introduction to Joseph H. Simonds,\r\ndealer in real-estate, oil-wells and leases. He looked around a few days\r\nand concluded to invest in sixty acres of the Fuller farm, Cranberry\r\ntownship, fronting on the Allegheny river. The block was sliced off the\r\nnorth end of the farm, a short distance below the upper bridge and the\r\nValley station. Mr. Simonds consented to be a partner in the\r\ntransaction. The transfer was effected, the deed recorded and a well\r\nstarted. It was situated on the hill, had twenty feet of second-sand and\r\npumped twenty barrels a day. The owner drilled two others on the bluff,\r\nthe three yielding twenty barrels for months. The ranks of the\r\noil-producers had received an addition in the person of—John Wilkes\r\nBooth.\r\n\r\nThe firm prospered, each of the members speculating and trading\r\nindividually. M. J. Colman, a capital fellow, was interested with one or\r\nboth in various deals. Men generally liked Booth and women admired him\r\nimmensely. His lustrous orbs, “twin-windows of the soul,” could look so\r\nsad and pensive as to awaken the tenderest pity, or fascinate like “the\r\nglittering eye” of the Ancient Mariner or the gaze of the basilisk.\r\n“Trilby” had not come to light, or he might have enacted the hypnotic\r\nrole of Svengali. His moods were variable and uncertain. At times he\r\nseemed morose and petulant, tired of everybody and “unsocial as a clam.”\r\nAgain he would court society, attend parties, dance, recite and be “the\r\nlife of the company.” He belonged to a select circle that exchanged\r\nvisits with a coterie of young folks in Oil City. A Confederate\r\nsympathizer and an enemy of the government, his closest intimates were\r\nstaunch Republicans and loyal citizens. William J. Wallis, the veteran\r\nactor who died in December of 1895, in a Philadelphia theater slapped\r\nhim on the mouth for calling President Lincoln a foul name. Booth’s\r\nacting, while inferior to his brother Edwin’s, evinced much dramatic\r\npower. He controlled his voice admirably, his movements were graceful\r\nand he spoke distinctly, as Franklinites whom he sometimes favored with\r\na reading can testify.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH H. SIMONDS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. WILKES BOOTH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOSES J. COLMAN.]\r\n\r\nOne morning in April, 1865, he left Franklin, telling Mr. Simonds he was\r\ngoing east for a few days. He carried a satchel, which indicated that he\r\ndid not expect his stay to be prolonged indefinitely. His wardrobe,\r\nbooks and papers remained in his room. Nothing was heard of him until\r\nthe crime of the century stilled all hearts and the wires flashed the\r\nhorrible news of Abraham Lincoln’s assassination. The excitement in\r\nFranklin, the murderer’s latest home, was intense. Crowds gathered to\r\nlearn the dread particulars and discuss Booth’s conduct and utterances.\r\nNot a word or act previous to his departure pointed to deliberate\r\npreparation for the frightful deed that plunged the nation in grief.\r\nThat he contemplated it before leaving Franklin the weight of evidence\r\ntended to disprove. He made no attempt to sell any of his property, to\r\nconvert his lands and wells into cash, to settle his partnership\r\naccounts or to pack his effects. He had money in the bank, wells\r\nbringing a good income and important business pending. All these things\r\nwent to show that, if not a sudden impulse, the killing of Lincoln was\r\nprompted by some occurrence in Washington that fired the passionate\r\nnature John Wilkes Booth inherited from his father. The world is\r\nfamiliar with the closing chapters of the dark tragedy—the assassin’s\r\nflight, the pursuit into Virginia, the burning barn, Sergeant Corbett’s\r\nfatal bullet, the pathetic death-scene on the Garrett porch and the last\r\nmessage, just as the dawn was breaking on the glassy eyes that opened\r\nfeebly for a moment: “Tell my mother I died for my country. I did what I\r\nthought was best.”\r\n\r\nThe wells and the land on the river were held by Booth’s heirs until\r\n1869, when the tract changed hands. The farm is producing no oil and the\r\nSimonds-Booth wells have disappeared. Had he not intended to return to\r\nFranklin, Booth would certainly have disposed of these interests and\r\ngiven the proceeds to his mother. “Joe” Simonds removed to Bradford to\r\nkeep books for Whitney & Wheeler, bankers and oil-operators, and died\r\nthere years ago. He was an expert accountant, quick, accurate and neat\r\nin his work and most fastidious in his attire. A blot on his paper, a\r\nfigure not exactly formed, a line one hair-breath crooked, a spot on his\r\nlinen or a speck of dust on his coat was simply intolerable. He was\r\ncorrect in language and deportment and honorable in his dealings. Colman\r\ncontinued his oil-operations, in company with W. R. Crawford, a\r\nreal-estate agency, until the eighties. He married Miss Ella Hull, the\r\nfinest vocalist Franklin ever boasted, daughter of Captain S. A. Hull,\r\nand removed to Boston. For years paralytic trouble has confined him to\r\nhis home. He is “one of nature’s nobleman.”\r\n\r\n“French Kate,” the woman who aided Ben Hogan at Pithole and followed him\r\nto Babylon and Parker, was a Confederate spy and supposed to be very\r\nfriendly with J. Wilkes Booth. Besides his oil-interests at Franklin,\r\nthe slayer of Abraham Lincoln owned a share in the Homestead well at\r\nPithole. A favorite legend tells how, by a singular coincidence, which\r\nproduced a sensation, the well was burned on the evening of the\r\nPresident’s assassination. It caught fire about the same instant the\r\nfatal bullet was fired in Ford’s Theater and tanks of burning oil\r\nenveloped Pithole in a dense smoke when the news of the tragedy flashed\r\nover the trembling wires. The Homestead well was not down until Lincoln\r\nhad been dead seven weeks, Pithole had no existence and there were no\r\nblazing tanks; otherwise the legend is correct. Two weeks before his\r\nappalling crime Booth was one of a number of passengers on the scow\r\ndoing duty as a ferry-boat across the Allegheny, after the Franklin\r\nbridge had burned. The day was damp and the water very cold. Some\r\ninhuman whelp threw a fine setter into the river. The poor beast swam to\r\nthe rear of the scow and Booth pulled him on board. He caressed the dog\r\nand bitterly denounced the fellow who could treat a dumb animal so\r\ncruelly. At another time he knocked down a cowardly ruffian for beating\r\na horse that was unable to pull a heavy load out of a mud-hole. He has\r\nbeen known to shelter stray kittens, to buy them milk and induce his\r\nlandlady to care for them until they could be provided with a home.\r\nTruly his was a contradictory nature. He sympathized with horses, dogs\r\nand cats, yet robbed the nation of its illustrious chief and plunged\r\nmankind into mourning. To newsboys Booth was always liberal, not\r\ninfrequently handing a dollar for a paper and saying: “No change; buy\r\nsomething useful with the money.” The first time he went to the\r\nMethodist Sunday-school, with “Joe” Simonds, he asked and answered\r\nquestions and put a ten-dollar bill in the collection-box.\r\n\r\nOver the hills to the interior of the townships developments spread.\r\nBredinsburg, Milton and Tarkiln loomed up in Cranberry, where Taylor &\r\nTorrey, S. P. McCalmont, Jacob Sheasley, B. W. Bredin and E. W. Echols\r\nhave sugar-plums. In Sandycreek, between Franklin and Foster, Angell &\r\nPrentice brought Bully Hill and Mount Hope to the front. The biggest\r\nwell in the package was a two-hundred barreler on Mount Hope, which\r\ncreated a mount of hopes that were not fully realized. George V. Forman\r\ncounted out one-hundred-and-fifty-thousand dollars for the Mount Hope\r\ncorner. The territory lasted well and averaged fairly. Bully Hill\r\nmerited its somewhat slangy title. Dr. C. D. Galbraith, George R.\r\nSheasley and Mattern & Son are among its present operators. Angell and\r\nPrentice parted company, each to engage in opening up the Butler region.\r\nPrentice, Crawford, Barbour & Co. did not let the grass grow under their\r\nfeet. They “knew a good thing at sight” and pumped tens-of-thousands of\r\nbarrels of oil from the country south of Franklin. The firm was notable\r\nin the seventies. Considerable drilling was done at Polk, where the\r\nstate is providing a half-million-dollar Home for Feeble-Minded\r\nChildren, and in the latitude of Utica, with about enough oil to be an\r\naggravation. The Shippen wells, a mile north of the county poor-house,\r\nhave produced for thirty years. West of them, on the Russell farm, the\r\nTwin wells, joined as tightly as the derricks could be placed, pumped\r\nfor years. This was the verge of productive territory, test wells on the\r\nlands of William Sanders, William Bean, A. Reynolds, John McKenzie,\r\nAlexander Frazier and W. Booth, clear to Cooperstown, finding a trifle\r\nof sand and scarcely a vestige of oil. The Raymonds, S. Ramage, John J.\r\nDoyle and Daniel Grimm had a very tidy offshoot at Raymilton. On this\r\nwise lubricating and second-sand oils were revealed for the benefit of\r\nmankind generally. The fly in the ointment was the clerical crank who\r\nwrote to President Lincoln to demand that the producing of heavy-oil be\r\nstopped peremptorily, as it had been stored in the ground to grease the\r\naxletree of the earth in its diurnal revolution! This communication\r\nreminded Lincoln of a “little story,” which he fired at the fellow with\r\nsuch effect that the candidate for a strait-jacket was perpetually\r\nsquelched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANGELL & PRENTICE’S WELLS BELOW FRANKLIN IN 1873.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN P. CRAWFORD.]\r\n\r\nHon. William Reid Crawford, a member of the firm of Prentice, Crawford,\r\nBarbour & Co., lives in Franklin. His parents were early settlers in\r\nnorth-western Pennsylvania. Alexander Grant, his maternal grandfather,\r\nbuilt the first stone-house in Lancaster county, removed to Butler\r\ncounty and located finally in Armstrong county, where he died sixty-five\r\nyears ago. In 1854 William R. and four of his brothers went to\r\nCalifornia and spent some time mining gold. Upon his return he settled\r\non a farm in Scrubgrass township, Venango county, of which section the\r\nCrawfords had been prominent citizens from the beginning of its history.\r\nRemoving to Franklin in 1865, Mr. Crawford engaged actively in the\r\nproduction of petroleum, operating extensively in various portions of\r\nthe oil-regions for twenty years. He acquired a high reputation for\r\nenterprise and integrity, was twice a city-councillor, served three\r\nterms as mayor, was long president of the school-board, was elected\r\nsheriff in 1887 and State-Senator in 1890. Untiring fidelity to the\r\ninterests of the people and uncompromising hostility to whatever he\r\nbelieved detrimental to the general welfare distinguished his public\r\ncareer. Genial and kindly to all, the friend of humanity and benefactor\r\nof the poor, no man stands better in popular estimation or is more\r\ndeserving of confidence and respect. His friends could not be crowded\r\ninto the Coliseum without bulging out the walls. Ebenezer Crawford,\r\nbrother of William R., died at Emlenton in August of 1897, on his\r\nseventy-sixth birthday. John P. Crawford, another brother, who made the\r\nCalifornia trip in 1849, still resides in the southern end of the county\r\nand is engaged in oil-operations. E. G. Crawford, a nephew, twice\r\nprothonotary of Venango and universally liked, passed away last June.\r\nHis cousin, C. J. Crawford, a first-class man anywhere and everywhere,\r\nserved as register and recorder with credit and ability. The Crawfords\r\n“are all right.”\r\n\r\n             For money may come and money may go,\r\n             But a good name stays to the end of the show.\r\n\r\nCaptain John K. Barbour, a man of imposing presence and admirable\r\nqualities, removed to Philadelphia after the dissolution of the firm.\r\nThe Standard Oil-Company gave him charge of the right-of-way department\r\nof its pipe-line service and he returned to Franklin. Two years ago,\r\nduring a business visit to Ohio, he died unexpectedly, to the deep\r\nregret of the entire community. S. A. Wheeler operated largely in the\r\nBradford field and organized the Tuna-Valley Bank of Whitney & Wheeler.\r\nFor a dozen years he has resided at Toledo, his early home. Like Captain\r\nBarbour, “Fred,” as he was commonly called, had an exhaustless mine of\r\nbright stories and a liberal share of the elements of popularity. One\r\nafternoon in 1875, three days before the fire that wiped out the town, a\r\nparty of us chanced to meet at St. Joe, Butler county, then the centre\r\nof oil-developments. An itinerating artist had his car moored opposite\r\nthe drug-store. Somebody proposed to have a group-picture. The motion\r\ncarried unanimously and a toss-up decided that L. H. Smith was to foot\r\nthe bill. The photographer brought out his camera, positions were taken\r\non the store-platform and the pictures were mailed an hour ahead of the\r\nblaze that destroyed most of the buildings and compelled the artist to\r\nhustle off his car on the double-quick. Samuel R. Reed, at the extreme\r\nright, operated in the Clarion field. He had a hardware-store in company\r\nwith the late Dr. Durrant and his home is in Franklin. James Orr,\r\nbetween whom and Reed a telegraph-pole is seen, was connected with the\r\nCentral Hotel at Petrolia and later was a broker in the Producers’\r\nExchange at Bradford. On the step is Thomas McLaughlin, now oil-buyer at\r\nLima, once captain of a talented base-ball club at Oil City and an\r\nactive oil-broker. Back of him is “Fred” Wheeler, with Captain Barbour\r\non his right and L. H. Smith sitting comfortably in front. Mr. Smith\r\nfigured largely at Pithole, operated satisfactorily around Petrolia and\r\nremoved years ago to New York. Cast in a giant mould, he weighs\r\nthree-hundred pounds and does credit to the illustrious legions of\r\nSmiths. He is a millionaire and has an office over the Seaboard Bank, at\r\nthe lower end of Broadway. Joseph Seep, the king-bee of good fellows,\r\nsits besides Smith. Pratt S. Crosby, formerly a jolly broker at Parker\r\nand Oil City, stands behind Seep. Next him is “Tom” King, who has “gone\r\nto the land of the leal,” J. J. McLaurin ending the row. James Amm, who\r\nwent from an Oil-city clerkship to coin a fortune at Bradford—a street\r\nbears his name—sits on the platform. Every man, woman, child and baby\r\nnear Oil City knew and admired “Jamie” Amm, who is now enjoying his\r\nwealth in Buffalo. Two out of the eleven in the group have “passed\r\nbeyond the last scene” and the other nine are scattered widely.\r\n\r\n                     “Friend after friend departs,\r\n                     Who hath not lost a friend?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUP AT ST. JOE, BUTLER COUNTY, IN 1874.]\r\n\r\nFrederic Prentice, one of the pluckiest operators ever known in\r\npetroleum-annals, was the first white child born on the site of Toledo,\r\nwhen Indians were the neighbors of the pioneers of Northern Ohio. His\r\nfather left a fine estate, which the son increased greatly by extensive\r\nlumbering, in which he employed three-thousand men. Losses in the panic\r\nof 1857 retired him from the business. He retrieved his fortune and paid\r\nhis creditors their claims in full, with ten per cent. interest, an act\r\nindicative of his sterling character. Reading in a newspaper about the\r\nDrake well, he decided to see for himself whether the story was fast\r\ncolors. Journeying to Venango county by way of Pittsburg, he met and\r\nengaged William Reed to accompany him. Reed had worked at the Tarentum\r\nsalt-wells and knew a thing or two about artesian-boring. The two\r\narrived at Franklin on the afternoon of the day Evans’s well turned the\r\nsettlement topsy-turvy. Next morning Prentice offered Evans\r\nforty-thousand dollars for a controlling interest in the well,\r\none-fourth down and the balance in thirty, sixty and ninety days. Evans\r\ndeclining to sell, the Toledo visitor bought from Martin & Epley an acre\r\nof ground on the north bank of French Creek, at the base of the hill,\r\nand contracted with Reed to “kick down” a well, the third in the\r\ndistrict. Prentice and Reed tramped over the country for days, locating\r\noil-deposits by means of the witch-hazel, which the Tarentumite handled\r\nskillfully. This was a forked stick, which it was claimed turned in the\r\nhands of the holder at spots where oil existed. Various causes delayed\r\nthe completion of the well, which at last proved disappointingly small.\r\nMeanwhile Mr. Prentice leased the Neeley farm, two miles up the\r\nAllegheny, in Cranberry township, and bored several paying wells. A\r\nrailroad station on the tract is named after him and R. G. Lamberton has\r\nconverted the property into a first-class stock-farm. Favorable reports\r\nfrom Little Kanawha River took him to West Virginia, where he leased and\r\npurchased immense blocks of land. Among them was the Oil-Springs tract,\r\non the Hughes River, from which oil had been skimmed for generations.\r\nTwo of his wells on the Kanawha yielded six-hundred barrels a day, which\r\nhad to be stored in ponds or lakes for want of tankage. Confederate\r\nraiders burned the wells, oil and machinery and drove off the workmen,\r\nputting an extinguisher on operations until the Grant-Lee episode\r\nbeneath the apple-tree at Appomattox.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the general direction of profitable developments would be\r\nnorth-east and south-west, Mr. Prentice surveyed a line from Venango\r\ncounty through West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee. This idea, really\r\nthe foundation of “the belt theory,” he spent thousands of dollars to\r\nestablish. Personal investigation and careful surveys confirmed his\r\nopinion, which was based upon observations in the Pennsylvania fields.\r\nThe line run thirty years ago touched numerous “springs” and “surface\r\nshows” and recent tests prove its remarkable accuracy. On this theory he\r\ndrilled at Mount Hope and Foster, opening a section that has produced\r\nseveral-million barrels of oil. C. D. Angell applied the principle in\r\nClarion and Butler counties, mapping out the probable course of the\r\n“belt” and leasing much prolific territory. His success led others to\r\nadopt the same plan, developing a number of pools in four states,\r\nalthough nature’s lines are seldom straight and the oil-bearing strata\r\nare deposited in curves and beds at irregular intervals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERIC PRENTICE.]\r\n\r\nIn company with W. W. Clark of New York, to whom he had traded a portion\r\nof his West-Virginia lands, Mr. Prentice secured a quarter-interest in\r\nthe Tarr farm, on Oil Creek, shortly before the sinking of the Phillips\r\nwell, and began shipping oil to New York. They paid three dollars apiece\r\nfor barrels, four dollars a barrel for hauling to the railroad and\r\nenormous freights to the east. The price dropping below the cost of\r\nfreights and barrels, the firm dug acres of pits to put tanks under\r\nground, covering them with planks and earth to prevent evaporation.\r\nTraces of these storage-vats remain on the east bank of Oil Creek. Crude\r\nfell to twenty-five cents a barrel at the wells and the outlook was\r\ndiscouraging. Clark & Prentice stopped drilling and turned their\r\nattention to finding a market. They constructed neat wooden packages\r\nthat would hold two cans of refined-oil, two oil-lamps and a dozen\r\nchimneys and sent one to each United-States Consul in Europe. Orders\r\nsoon rushed in from foreign countries, especially Germany, France and\r\nEngland, stimulating the erection of refineries and creating a large\r\nexport-trade. Clark & Summer, who also owned an interest in the Tarr\r\nfarm, built the Standard Refinery at Pittsburg and agreed to take from\r\nClark & Prentice one-hundred-thousand barrels of crude at a dollar a\r\nbarrel, to be delivered as required during the year. Before the delivery\r\nof the first twenty-five-thousand barrels the price climbed to one-fifty\r\nand to six dollars before the completion of the contract, which was\r\ncarried out to the letter. The advance continued to fourteen dollars a\r\nbarrel, lasting only one day at this figure. These were vivifying days\r\nin oleaginous circles, never to be repeated while Chronos wields his\r\ntrusty blade.\r\n\r\nWhen crude reached two dollars Mr. Prentice bought the\r\nWashington-McClintock farm, on which Petroleum Centre was afterwards\r\nlocated, for three-hundred-thousand dollars. Five New-Yorkers, one of\r\nthem the president of the Shoe and Leather Bank and another the\r\nproprietor of the Brevoort House, advanced fifty-thousand dollars for\r\nthe first payment. Within sixty days Prentice sold three-quarters of his\r\ninterest for nine-hundred-thousand dollars and organized the Central\r\nPetroleum Oil-Company, with a capital of five-millions! Wishing to repay\r\nthe New-York loan, the Brevoort landlord desired him to retain his share\r\nof the money and invest it as he pleased. For his ten-thousand dollars\r\nmine host received eighty-thousand in six months, a return that leaves\r\ngovernment-bond syndicates and Cripple-Creek speculations out in the\r\nlatitude of Nansen’s north-pole. The company netted fifty-thousand\r\ndollars a month in dividends for years and lessees cleared three or four\r\nmillions from their operations on the farm. Greenbacks circulated like\r\nwaste-paper, Jules Verne’s fancies were surpassed constantly by actual\r\noccurrences and everybody had money to burn.\r\n\r\nPrentice and his associates purchased many tracts along Oil Creek,\r\nincluding the lands where Oil City stands and the Blood farm of\r\nfive-hundred acres. In the Butler district he drilled hundreds of wells\r\nand built the Relief Pipe-Line. Organizing The Producers’ Consolidated\r\nLand-and-Petroleum-Company, with a capital of two-and-a-half millions,\r\nhe managed it efficiently and had a prominent part in the Bradford\r\ndevelopment. Boston capitalists paid in twelve-hundred-thousand dollars,\r\nPrentice keeping a share in his oil-properties representing\r\nthirteen-hundred-thousand more. The company is now controlled by the\r\nStandard, with L. B. Lockhart as superintendent. Its indefatigable\r\nfounder also organized the Boston Oil Company to operate in Kentucky and\r\nTennessee, put down oil-wells in Peru and gas-wells in West Virginia,\r\nproduced and piped thousands of barrels of crude daily and was a vital\r\nforce in petroleum-affairs for eighteen years. The confidence and esteem\r\nof his compatriots were attested by his unanimous election to the\r\npresidency of the Oilmen’s League, a secret-society formed to resist the\r\nproposed encroachments of the South-Improvement Company. The League\r\naccomplished its mission and then quietly melted out of existence.\r\n\r\nSince 1877 Mr. Prentice has devoted his attention chiefly to lumbering\r\nin West Virginia and to his brown-stone quarries at Ashland, Wisconsin.\r\nThe death of his son, Frederick A., by accidental shooting, was a sad\r\nbereavement to the aged father. His suits to get possession of the site\r\nof Duluth, the city of Proctor Knott’s impassioned eulogy, included in a\r\nhuge grant of land deeded to him by the Indians, were scarcely less\r\nfamous than Mrs. Gaines’s protracted litigation to recover a slice of\r\nNew Orleans. The claim involved the title to property valued at\r\ntwelve-millions of dollars. From his Ashland quarries the owner took out\r\na monolith, designed for the Columbian Exposition in 1893, forty yards\r\nlong and ten feet square at the base. Beside this monster stone\r\nCleopatra’s Needle, disintegrating in Central Park, Pompey’s Pillar and\r\nthe biggest blocks in the pyramids are Tom-Thumb pigmies. At\r\nseventy-four Mr. Prentice, foremost in energy and enterprise, retains\r\nmuch of his youthful vigor. Earnest and sincere, a master of business,\r\nhis word as good as gold, Frederic Prentice holds an honored place in\r\nthe ranks of representative oil-producers, “nobles of nature’s own\r\ncreating.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYRUS D. ANGELL.]\r\n\r\nA native of Chautauqua county, N. Y., where he was born in 1826, Cyrus\r\nD. Angell received a liberal education, served as School-Commissioner\r\nand engaged in mercantile pursuits at Forestville. Forced through\r\ntreachery and the monetary stringency of the times to compromise with\r\nhis creditors, he recovered his financial standing and paid every cent\r\nof his indebtedness, principal and interest. In 1867 he came to the\r\noil-regions with a loan of one-thousand dollars and purchased an\r\ninterest in property at Petroleum Centre that paid handsomely. Prior to\r\nthis, in connection with Buffalo capitalists, he had bought Belle\r\nIsland, in the Allegheny River at Scrubgrass, upon which soon after his\r\narrival he drilled three wells that averaged one-hundred barrels each\r\nfor two years, netting the owners over two-hundred-thousand dollars.\r\nOperations below Franklin, in company with Frederic Prentice, also\r\nproved highly profitable. His observations of the course of developments\r\nalong Oil Creek and the Allegheny led Mr. Angell to the conclusion that\r\npetroleum would be found in “belts” or regular lines. He adopted the\r\ntheory that two “belts” existed, one running from Petroleum Centre to\r\nScrubgrass and the other from St. Petersburg through Butler county.\r\nSatisfied of the correctness of this view, he leased or purchased all\r\nthe lands within the probable boundaries of the “belt” from Foster to\r\nBelle Island, a distance of six miles. The result justified his\r\nexpectations, ninety per cent. of the wells yielding abundantly. With\r\n“the belt theory,” which he followed up with equal success farther\r\nsouth, Mr. Angell’s name is linked indissolubly. His researches enriched\r\nhim and were of vast benefit to the producers generally. He did much to\r\nextend the Butler region, drilling far ahead of tested territory. The\r\ntown of Angelica owed its creation to his fortunate operations in the\r\nneighborhood, conducted on a comprehensive scale. Reverses could not\r\ncrush his manly spirit. He did a large real-estate business at Bradford\r\nfor some years, opening an office at Pittsburg when the Washington field\r\nbegan to loom up. Failing health compelling him to seek relief in\r\nforeign travel, last year he went to Mexico and Europe to recuperate.\r\nMr. Angell is endowed with boundless energy, fine intellectual powers\r\nand rare social acquirements. During his career in Oildom he was an\r\nexcellent sample of the courageous, unconquerable men who have made\r\npetroleum the commercial wonder of the world.\r\n\r\nAn old couple in Cranberry township, who eked out a scanty living on a\r\nrocky farm near the river, sold their land for sixty-thousand dollars at\r\nthe highest pitch of the oil-excitement around Foster. This was more\r\nmoney than the pair had ever before seen, much less expected to handle\r\nand own. It was paid in bank-notes at noon and the log-house was to be\r\nvacated next day. Towards evening the poor old woman burst into tears\r\nand insisted that her husband should give back the money to the man that\r\n“wanted to rob them of their home.” She was inconsolable, declaring they\r\nwould be “turned out to starve, without a roof to cover them.” The idea\r\nthat sixty-thousand dollars would buy an ideal home brought no comfort\r\nto the simple-minded creature, whose hopes and ambitions were confined\r\nto the lowly abode that had sheltered her for a half-century. A promise\r\nto settle near her brother in Ohio reconciled her somewhat, but it\r\nalmost broke her faithful heart to leave a spot endeared by many tender\r\nassociations. John Howard Payne, himself a homeless wanderer, whose song\r\nhas been sung in every tongue and echoed in every soul, jingled by\r\ninnumerable hand-organs and played by the masters of music, was right:\r\n\r\n          “Be it ever so humble, there’s no place like home.”\r\n\r\nThe refusal of his wife to sign the deed conveying the property enabled\r\na wealthy Franklinite to gather a heap of money. The tract was rough and\r\nunproductive and the owner proposed to accept for it the small sum\r\noffered by a neighboring farmer, who wanted more pasture for his cattle.\r\nFor the first time in her life the wife declined to sign a paper at her\r\nhusband’s request, saying she had a notion the farm would be valuable\r\nsome day. The purchaser refused to take it subject to a dower and the\r\nland lay idle. At length oil-developments indicated that the “belt” ran\r\nthrough the farm. Scores of wells yielded freely, netting the land-owner\r\na fortune and convincing him that womanly intuition is a sure winner.\r\n\r\nA citizen of Franklin, noted for his conscientiousness and liberality,\r\nwas interested in a test-well at the beginning of the Scrubgrass\r\ndevelopment. He vowed to set aside one-fourth of his portion of the\r\noutput of the well “for the Lord,” as he expressed it. To the delight of\r\nthe owners, who thought the venture hazardous, the well showed for a\r\nhundred barrels when the tubing was put in. On his way back from the\r\nscene the Franklin gentleman did a little figuring, which proved that\r\nthe Lord’s percentage of the oil might foot up fifty dollars a day. This\r\nwas a good deal of money for religious purposes. The maker of the vow\r\nreflected that the Lord could get along without so much cash and he\r\ndecided to clip the one-fourth down to one-tenth, arguing that the\r\nlatter was the scripture limit. Talking it over with his wife, she\r\nadvised him to stick to his original determination and not trifle with\r\nthe Lord. The husband took his own way, as husbands are prone to do, and\r\nrevisited the well next day. Something had gone wrong with the\r\nworking-valve, the tubing had to be drawn out and the well never pumped\r\na barrel of oil! The disappointed operator concluded, as he charged two\r\nthousand dollars to his profit-and-loss account, that it was not the\r\nLord who came out at the small end of the horn in the transaction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. C. A. ADAMS, D.D.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. EZRA F. CRANE, D.D.]\r\n\r\nRev. Clarence A. Adams, the eloquent ex-pastor of the First Baptist\r\nChurch at Franklin, is the lucky owner of a patch of paying territory at\r\nRaymilton. Recently he finished a well which pumped considerable\r\nsalt-water with the oil. Contrary to Cavendish and the ordinary custom,\r\nanother operator drilled very close to the boundary of the Adams lease\r\nand torpedoed the well heavily. Instead of sucking the oil from the\r\npreacher’s nice pumper, the new well took away most of the salt-water\r\nand doubled the production of petroleum! Commonly it would seem rather\r\nmean to rob a Baptist minister of water, but in this case Dr. Adams is\r\nperfectly resigned to the loss of aqueous fluid and gain of dollar-fifty\r\ncrude. A profound student of Shakespeare, Browning and the Bible, a\r\nbrilliant lecturer and master of pulpit-oratory, may he also stand on a\r\nlofty rung of the greasian ladder and attain the goodly age of\r\nFranklin’s “grand old man,” Rev. Dr. Crane. This “father in Israel,”\r\nwhose death in February of 1896 the whole community mourned, left a\r\nrecord of devoted service as a physician and clergyman for over sixty\r\nyears that has seldom been equaled. He healed the sick, smoothed the\r\npillow of the dying, relieved the distressed, reclaimed the erring,\r\ncomforted the bereaved, turned the faces of the straying Zionward and\r\nfound the passage to the tomb “a gentle wafting to immortal life.” Let\r\nhis memory be kept green.\r\n\r\n                   “Though old, he still retained\r\n             His manly sense and energy of mind.\r\n             Virtuous and wise he was, but not severe,\r\n             For he remembered that he once was young;\r\n             His kindly presence checked no decent joy.\r\n             Him e’en the dissolute admired. Can he be dead\r\n             Whose spiritual influence is upon his kind?”\r\n\r\nThe late Thomas McDonough, a loyal-hearted son of the Emerald Isle, was\r\nalso an energetic operator in the lubricating region. He had an\r\nabundance of rollicking wit, “the pupil of the soul’s clear eye,” and an\r\nunfailing supply of the drollest stories. Desiring to lease a farm in\r\nSandy-Creek township, supposed to be squarely “on the belt,” he started\r\nat daybreak to interview the owner, feeling sure his mission would\r\nsucceed. An unexpected sight presented itself through the open door, as\r\nthe visitor stepped upon the porch of the dwelling. The farmer’s wife\r\nwas setting the table for breakfast and Frederic Prentice was folding a\r\npaper carefully. McDonough realized in a twinkling that Prentice had\r\nsecured the lease and his trip was fruitless. “I am looking for John\r\nSmith” he stammered, as the farmer invited him to enter, and beat a\r\nhasty retreat. For years his friends rallied the Colonel on his search\r\nand would ask with becoming solemnity whether he had discovered John\r\nSmith. The last time we met in Philadelphia this incident was revived\r\nand the query repeated jocularly. The jovial McDonough died in 1894. It\r\nis safe to assume that he will easily find numerous John Smiths in the\r\nland of perpetual reunion. One day he told a story in an office on\r\nThirteenth street, Franklin, which tickled the hearers immensely. A\r\nfull-fledged African, who had been sweeping the back-room, broke into a\r\ntumultuous laugh. At that moment a small boy was riding a donkey\r\ndirectly in front of the premises. The jackass heard the peculiar laugh\r\nand elevated his capacious ears more fully to take in the complete\r\nvolume of sound. He must have thought the melody familiar and believed\r\nhe had stumbled upon a relative. Despite the frantic exertions of the\r\nboy, the donkey rushed towards the building whence the boisterous guffaw\r\nproceeded, shoved his head inside the door and launched a terrific bray.\r\nThe bystanders were convulsed at this evidence of mistaken identity,\r\nwhich the jolly story-teller frequently rehearsed for the delectation of\r\nhis hosts of friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS M’DONOUGH.]\r\n\r\nLooking over the Milton diggings one July day, Col. McDonough met an\r\namateur-operator who was superintending the removal of a wooden-tank\r\nfrom a position beside his first and only well. A discussion started\r\nregarding the combustibility of the thick sediment collected on the\r\nbottom of the tank. The amateur maintained the stuff would not burn and\r\nMcDonough laughingly replied, “Well, just try it and see!” The fellow\r\nlighted a match and applied it to the viscid mass before McDonough could\r\ninterfere, saying with a grin that he proposed to wait patiently for the\r\nresult. He didn’t have to wait “until Orcus would freeze over and the\r\nboys play shinny on the ice.” In the ninetieth fraction of a second the\r\ndeposit blazed with intense enthusiasm, quickly enveloping the well-rig\r\nand the surroundings in flames. Clouds of smoke filled the air,\r\nsuggesting fancies of Pittsburg or Sheol. Charred fragments of the\r\nderrick, engine-house and tank, with an acre of blackened territory over\r\nwhich the burning sediment had spread, demonstrated that the amateur’s\r\nidea had been decidedly at fault. The experiment convinced him as\r\nsearchingly as a Roentgen ray that McDonough had the right side of the\r\nargument. “If the ‘b. s.’ had been as green as the blamed fool, it\r\nwouldn’t have burned,” was the Colonel’s appropriate comment.\r\n\r\nMiss Lizzie Raymond, daughter of the pioneer who founded Raymilton and\r\nerected the first grist-mill at Utica, has long taught the infant-class\r\nof the Presbyterian Sunday-school at Franklin. Once the lesson was about\r\nthe wise and the foolish virgins, the good teacher explaining the\r\nsubject in a style adapted to the juvenile mind. A cute little tot,\r\nimpressed by the sad plight of the virgins who had no oil in their\r\nlamps, innocently inquired: “Miss ’Aymond, tan’t oo tell ’em dirls to\r\nturn to our house an’ my papa ’ll div’ ’em oil f’um his wells?” Heaven\r\nbless the children that come as sunbeams to lighten our pathway, to\r\nteach us lessons of unselfishness and prevent the rough world from\r\nturning our hearts as hard as the mill-stone.\r\n\r\nJudge Trunkey, who presided over the Venango court a dozen years and was\r\nthen elected to the Supreme Bench, was hearing a case of desertion. An\r\nOil-City lawyer, proud of his glossy black beard, represented the\r\nforsaken wife, a comely young woman from Petroleum Centre, who dandled a\r\nbright baby of twenty months on her knee. Mother and baby formed a\r\npretty picture and the lawyer took full advantage of it in his closing\r\nappeal to the jury. At a brilliant climax he turned to his client and\r\nsaid: “Let me have the child!” He was raising it to his arms, to hold\r\nbefore the men in the box and describe the heinous meanness of the\r\nwretch who could leave such beauty and innocence to starve. The baby\r\nspoiled the fun by springing up, clutching the attorney’s beard and\r\nscreaming: “Oh, papa!” The audience fairly shrieked. Judge Trunkey\r\nlaughed until the tears flowed and it was five minutes before order\r\ncould be restored. That ended the oratory and the jury salted the\r\ndefendant handsomely. Hon. James S. Connelly, an Associate Judge, who\r\nnow resides in Philadelphia and enjoys his well-earned fortune, was also\r\non the bench at the moment. Judge Trunkey, one of the purest, noblest\r\nmen and greatest jurists that ever shed lustre upon Pennsylvania, passed\r\nto his reward six years ago.\r\n\r\n    In your wide peregrinations from the poles to the equator,\r\n    Should you hear some ignoramus—let out of his incubator—\r\n    Say the heavy-oil of Franklin is not earth’s best lubricator,\r\n    Do as did renown’d Tom Corwin, the great Buckeye legislator,\r\n    When a jabberwock in Congress sought to brand him as a traitor,\r\n    Just “deny the allegation and defy the allegator!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MILLER & SIBLEY’S PROSPECT-HILL STOCK FARM FRANKLIN, PA.]\r\n\r\n                             KEEPING STEP.\r\n\r\nThe Shasta was Karns City’s first well.\r\n\r\nMissouri has two wells producing oil.\r\n\r\nNorth Dakota has traces of natural-gas.\r\n\r\nNinety wells in Japan pump four-hundred barrels.\r\n\r\nElk City, in the Clarion field, once had two-thousand population.\r\n\r\nThe Rob Roy well, at Karns City, has produced a quarter-million barrels\r\nof oil.\r\n\r\nAlaska-oil is cousin of asphalt-pitch, very heavy, and thick as\r\nNew-Orleans molasses in midwinter.\r\n\r\nWade Hampton, postmaster of Pittsburg, and cousin of Governor Wade\r\nHampton, organized one of the first petroleum companies in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nGeneral Herman Haupt, of Philadelphia, now eighty-one years old,\r\nsurveyed the route and constructed the first pipe-line across\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nRobert Nevin, founder of the Pittsburg _Times_, drilled a dry-hole\r\nfour-hundred feet, ten miles west of Greensburg, in 1858, a year before\r\nDrake’s successful experiment in Oil Creek.\r\n\r\nThe Powell Oil-Company, superintended by Col. A. C. Ferris, still a\r\nresident of New York, paid fifty-thousand dollars in cash for the Shirk\r\nfarm, half way between Franklin and Oil City, drilled a dry-hole and\r\nabandoned the property.\r\n\r\n          The gentle wife who seeks your faults to cover\r\n          You don’t deserve; prize naught on earth above her;\r\n          Keep step and be through life her faithful lover.\r\n\r\nThe new town of Guffey, the liveliest in Colorado, thirty miles from\r\nCripple Creek, is fitly named in honor of James M.

The Fonner well, struck in March, and territory around it\r\nsold for two-hundred-thousand dollars.

For\r\nsixty years the occupants of these tracts had forced a bare subsistence\r\nfrom the reluctant soil. “Content to live, to propagate and die,” their\r\nrequirements and their resources were alike scanty. They knew nothing of\r\nthe artificial necessities and extravagances of fashionable life. To\r\nmost of them the great, busy, plodding world was a sealed book, which\r\nthey had neither the means nor the inclination to unclasp. The world\r\nreciprocated by wagging in its customary groove, blissfully unconscious\r\nof the scattered settlers on the banks of the Allegheny’s tributary. A\r\ntrip on a raft to Pittsburg, with the privilege of walking back, was the\r\nlimit of their journeyings from the hills and rocks of Venango. Hunting,\r\nfishing and hauling saw-logs in winter aided in replenishing the\r\ndomestic larder. None imagined the unproductive valley would become the\r\ncradle of an industry before which cotton and coal and iron must “hide\r\ntheir diminished heads.” No prophet had proclaimed that lands on Oil\r\nCreek would sell for more than corner-lots in London or New York. Who\r\ncould have conceived that these bold cliffs and patches of clearing\r\nwould enlist ambitious mortals from every quarter of the globe in a mad\r\nrace to secure a foothold on the coveted acres? What seventh son of a\r\nseventh son could foresee that a thousand dollars spent on the Willard\r\nfarm would yield innumerable millions? Who could predict that a tiny\r\nstream of greenish fluid, pumped from a hole on an island too\r\ninsignificant to have a name, would swell into the vast ocean of\r\npetroleum that is the miracle of the nineteenth century? Fortune has\r\nplayed many pranks, but the queerest of them all were the vagaries\r\nincidental to the petroleum-development on Oil Creek.\r\n\r\nThe Bissell, Griffin, Conley, two Stackpole, Pott, Shreve, two Fleming,\r\nHenderson and Jones farms, comprising the four miles between the Drake\r\nwell and the Miller tract, were not especially prolific. Traces of a\r\nhundred oil-pits, in some of which oak-trees had grown to enormous size,\r\nare visible on the Bissell plot of eighty acres. A large dam, used for\r\npond-freshets, was located on Oliver Stackpole’s farm. Two refineries of\r\nsmall capacity were built on the Stackpole and Fletcher lands, where\r\neighteen or twenty wells produced moderately. The owner of a flowing\r\nwell on the lower Fleming farm, imitating the man who killed the goose\r\nthat laid the golden eggs, sought to increase its output by putting the\r\ntubing and seed-bagging farther down. The well resented the\r\ninterference, refusing to yield another drop and pointing the obvious\r\nmoral: “Let well enough alone!” The Miller farm of four-hundred acres,\r\non both sides of the creek, was purchased in 1863 from Robert Miller by\r\nthe Indian Rock-Oil Company of New York. Now a railroad-station and\r\nformerly the principal shipping-point for oil, refineries were started,\r\nwells were drilled and the stirring town of Meredith blossomed for a\r\nlittle space. The Lincoln well turned out sixty barrels a day, the\r\nBoston fifty, the Bobtail forty, the Hemlock thirty and others from ten\r\nto twenty-five, at an average depth of six-hundred feet. The Barnsdall\r\nOil-Company operated on the Miller and the Shreve farms, drilling\r\nextensively on Hemlock Run, and George Bartlett ran the Sunshine\r\nOil-Works. The village, the refineries and the derricks have disappeared\r\nas completely as Herculaneum or Sir John Franklin.\r\n\r\nGeorge Shaffer owned fifty acres below the Miller farm, divided by Oil\r\nCreek into two blocks, one in Cherrytree township and the other in\r\nAllegheny. Twenty-four wells, eight of them failures, were put down on\r\nthe flats and the abrupt hill bordering the eastern shore of the stream.\r\nSamuel Downer’s Rangoon and three of Watson & Brewer’s were the largest,\r\nranking in the fifty-barrel list. In July of 1864 the Oil-Creek Railroad\r\nwas finished to Shaffer farm, which immediately became a station of\r\ngreat importance. From one house and barn the place expanded in sixty\r\ndays to a town of three-thousand population. And such a town!\r\nSixteen-hundred teams, mainly employed to draw oil from the wells down\r\nthe creek, supported the stables, boarding-houses and hotels that sprang\r\nup in a night. Every second door opened into a bar-room. The buildings\r\nwere “balloon frames,” constructed entirely of boards, erected in a few\r\nhours and liable to collapse on the slightest pretext. Houses of cards\r\nwould be about as comfortable and substantial. Outdo Hezekiah, by\r\nrolling back time’s dial thirty-one years, and in fancy join the crowd\r\nheaded for Shaffer six months after the advent of the railway.\r\n\r\nStart from Corry, “the city of stumps,” with the Downer refinery and a\r\njumble of houses thrown around the fields. Here the Atlantic &\r\nGreat-Western, the Philadelphia & Erie and the Oil-Creek Railroads meet.\r\nThe station will not shelter one-half the motley assemblage bound for\r\nOildom. “Mother Cary is plucking her geese” and snow-flakes are dropping\r\nthickly. Speculators from the eastern cities, westerners in quest of “a\r\ngood thing,” men going to work at the wells, capitalists and farmers,\r\nadventurers and drummers clamor for tickets. It is the reverse of “an\r\nAdamless Eden,” for only three women are to be seen. At last the train\r\nbacks to the rickety depot and a wild struggle commences. Scrambling for\r\nthe elevated cars in New York or Chicago is a feeble movement compared\r\nwith this frantic onslaught. Courtesy and chivalry are forgotten in the\r\nrush. Men swarm upon the steps, clog the platforms, pack the\r\nbaggage-car, thrust the women aside, stick to the cowcatcher and clamber\r\non the roofs of the coaches. Over the roughest track on earth, which\r\nwinds and twists and skirts the creek most of the way, the train rattles\r\nand jolts and pitches. The conductor’s job is no sinecure, as he\r\nsqueezes through the dense mass that leaves him without sufficient\r\nelbow-room to “punch in the presence of the passenjare.” Derricks—tall,\r\ngaunt skeletons, pickets of the advancing army—keep solemn watch here\r\nand there, the number increasing as Titusville comes in sight.\r\n\r\nA hundred people get off and two-hundred manage somehow to get on. Past\r\nthe Drake well, past a forest of derricks, past steep cliffs and\r\ntortuous ravines the engineer speeds the train. Did you ever think what\r\na weight of responsibility rests upon the brave fellow in the\r\nlocomotive-cab, whose clear eye looks straight along the track and whose\r\nsteady hand grasps the throttle? Should he relax his vigilance or lose\r\nhis nerve one moment, scores of lives might be the fearful penalty. A\r\nshort stop at Miller Farm, a whiff of refinery-smells and in five\r\nminutes Shaffer is reached. The board-station is on the right hand,\r\nlandings on the left form a semi-circle hundreds of feet in length,\r\nfreight-cars jam the double track and warehouses dot the bank. The\r\nflat-about thirty rods wide-contains the mushroom-town, bristling with\r\nthe undiluted essence of petroleum-activity. Three-hundred teamsters are\r\nunloading barrels of oil from wagons dragged by patient, abused horses\r\nand mules through miles of greasy, clayey mud. Everything reeks with\r\noil. It pervades the air, saturates clothes and conversation, floats on\r\nthe muddy scum and fills lungs and nostrils with its peculiar odor. One\r\ncannot step a yard without sinking knee-deep in deceptive mire that\r\nperforms the office of a boot-jack if given “a ghost of a show.”\r\nChristian’s Slough of Despond wasn’t a circumstance to this adhesive\r\npaste, which engulfs unwary travelers to their trouser-pockets and\r\nbegets a dreadful craving for roads not\r\n\r\n                         “Wholly unclassable,\r\n                         Almost impassable,\r\n                         Scarcely jackassable.”\r\n\r\nThe trip of thirty-five miles has shaken breakfast clear down to the\r\npilgrims’ boots. Out of the cars the hungry passengers tumble as\r\nfrantically as they had clambered in and break for the hotels and\r\nrestaurants. A dollar pays for a dinner more nearly first-class in price\r\nthan in quality. The narrow hall leading to the dining-room is crammed\r\nwith men—Person’s Hotel fed four-hundred a day—waiting their turn for\r\nvacant chairs at the tables. Bolting the meal hurriedly, the next\r\ninquiry is how to get down the creek. There are no coupés, no prancing\r\nsteeds, no stages, no carriages for hire. The hoarse voice of a hackman\r\nwould be sweeter music than Beethoven’s “Moonlight Sonata” or\r\nMendelssohn’s “Wedding March.” Horseback-riding is impracticable and\r\nwalking seems the only alternative. To wade and flounder twelve\r\nmiles—Oil City is that far off—is the dreary prospect that freezes the\r\nblood. Hark! In strident tones a fierce-looking fellow is shouting:\r\n“Packet-boat for Oil City! This way for the packet-boat! Packet-boat!\r\nPacket-boat!” Visions of a pleasant jaunt in a snug cabin lure you to\r\nthe landing. The “packet-boat” proves to be an oily scow, without sail,\r\nengine, awning or chair, which horses have drawn up the stream from Oil\r\nCity. It will float back at the rate of three miles an hour and the fare\r\nis three-fifty! The name and picture of “Pomeroy’s Express,” the best of\r\nthese nondescript Oil-Creek vessels, will bring a smile and warm the\r\ncockles of many an old-timer’s heart!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “POMEROY’S EXPRESS” BETWEEN SHAFFER AND OIL CITY.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps you decide to stay all night at Shaffer and start on foot early\r\nin the morning. A chair in a room thick with tobacco-smoke, or a quilt\r\nin a corner of the bar, is the best you can expect. By rare luck you may\r\nhappen to pre-empt a half-interest in a small bed, tucked with two or\r\nthree more in a closet-like apartment. Your room-mates talk of “flowing\r\nwells—five-hundred-thousand dollars—third sand—big strike—rich in a\r\nweek—thousand-dollars a day,” until you fall asleep to dream of wells\r\nspouting seas of mud and hapless wights wading in greenbacks to their\r\nwaists. Awaking cold and unrefreshed, your brain fuddled and your\r\nthoughts confused, you gulp a breakfast of “ham ’n eggs ’n fried\r\npotatoes ’n coffee” and prepare to strike out boldly. Encased in\r\nrubber-boots that reach above the thighs, you choose one of the two\r\npaths—each worse than the other—pray for sustaining grace and begin the\r\ntoilsome journey. Having seen the tips of the elephant’s ears, you mean\r\nto see the end of his tail and be able to estimate the bulk of the\r\nanimal. Night is closing in as you round up at your destination,\r\nexhausted and mud-coated to the chin. But you have traversed a region\r\nthat has no duplicate “in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in\r\nthe waters under the earth,” and feel recompensed a thousand-fold for\r\nthe fatigue and exposure. Were your years to exceed Thomas Parr’s and\r\nMethuselah’s combined, you will never again behold such a scene as the\r\nOil-Creek valley presented in the days of “the middle passage” between\r\nShaffer and Oil City. Rake it over with a fine-comb, turn on the X-rays,\r\ndig and scrape and root and to-day you couldn’t find a particle of\r\nShaffer as big as a toothpick! When the railroad was extended the\r\nbuildings were torn down and carted to the next station.\r\n\r\nWidow Sanney’s hundred-acre farm, south of the Shaffer, had three\r\nrefineries and a score of unremunerative wells. David Gregg’s\r\ntwo-hundred acres on the west side of Oil Creek, followed suit with\r\nforty non-paying wells, three that yielded oil and the Victoria and\r\nContinental refineries. The McCoy well, the first put down below the\r\nDrake, at two-hundred feet averaged fifteen barrels a day from March\r\nuntil July, 1860. Fire burning the rig, the well was drilled to\r\nfive-hundred feet and proved dry. R. P. Beatty sold his two-hundred\r\nacres on Oil Creek and Hemlock Run to the Clinton Oil-Company of New\r\nYork, a bunch of medium wells repaying the investment. James Farrell,\r\na teamster, for two-hundred dollars purchased a thirty-acre bit of\r\nrough land south of Beatty, on the east side of Oil Creek and Bull\r\nRun, the extreme south-west corner of Allegheny—now Oil\r\nCreek—township. In the spring of 1860 Orange Noble leased sixteen\r\nacres for six hundred dollars and one-quarter royalty. Jerking a\r\n“spring-pole” five months sank a hole one-hundred-and-thirty feet,\r\nwithout a symptom of greasiness, and the well was neglected nearly\r\nthree years. The “third sand” having been found on the creek, the\r\nholders of the Farrell lease decided to drill the old hole deeper.\r\nGeorge B. Delamater and L. L. Lamb were associated with Noble in the\r\nventure. They contracted with Samuel S. Fertig, of Titusville, whose\r\nenergy and reliability had gained the good-will of operators, to drill\r\nabout five-hundred feet. Fertig went to work in April of 1863, using a\r\nten-horse boiler and engine and agreeing to take one-sixteenth of the\r\nworking-interest as part payment. He had lots of the push that long\r\nsince placed him in the van as a successful producer, enjoying a\r\nwell-earned competence. Early in May, at four-hundred-and-fifty feet,\r\na “crevice” of unusual size was encountered. Fearing to lose his\r\ntools, the contractor shut down for consultation with the well-owners.\r\nNoble was at Pittsburg on a hunt for tubing, which he ordered from\r\nPhiladelphia. The well stood idle two weeks, waiting for the tubing,\r\nsurface-water vainly trying to fill the hole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL S. FERTIG.]\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of May twenty-seventh, 1863, everything was ready.\r\n“Start her slowly,” Noble shouted from the derrick to Fertig, who stood\r\nbeside the engine and turned on the steam. The rods moved up and down\r\nwith steady stroke, bringing a stream of fresh water, which it was hoped\r\na day’s pumping might exhaust. Then it would be known whether two of the\r\nowners—Noble and Delamater—had acted wisely on May fifteenth in\r\nrejecting one-hundred-thousand dollars for one-half of the well. Noble\r\nwent to an eating-house near by for a lunch. He was munching a sandwich\r\nwhen a boy at the door bawled: “Golly! Ain’t that well spittin’ oil?”\r\nTurning around, he saw a column of oil and water rising a hundred feet,\r\nenveloping the trees and the derrick in dense spray! The gas roared, the\r\nground fairly shook and the workmen hastened to extinguish the fire\r\nbeneath the boiler. The “Noble well,” destined to be the most profitable\r\never known, had begun its dazzling career at the dizzy figure of\r\nthree-thousand barrels a day!\r\n\r\nCrude was four dollars a barrel, rose to six, to ten, to\r\nthirteen! Compute the receipts from the Noble well at these\r\nquotations—twelve-thousand, eighteen-thousand, thirty-thousand,\r\nthirty-nine-thousand dollars a day! Sinbad’s fabled Valley of Diamonds\r\nwas a ten-cent side-show in comparison with the actual realities of the\r\nvalley of Oil Creek.\r\n\r\nSoon the foaming volume filled the hollow close to the well and ran into\r\nthe creek. What was to be done? In the forcible jargon of a driller:\r\n“The divil wuz to pay an’ no pitch hot!” For two-hundred dollars three\r\nmen crawled through the blinding shower and contrived to attach a\r\nstop-cock device to the pipe. By sunset a seven-hundred-barrel tank was\r\noverflowing. Boatmen down the creek, notified to come at once for all\r\nthey wanted at two dollars a barrel, by midnight took the oil directly\r\nfrom the well. Next morning the stream was turned into a\r\nthree-thousand-barrel tank, filling it in twenty-one hours!\r\nSixty-two-thousand barrels were shipped and fifteen-thousand tanked,\r\nexclusive of leakage and waste, in thirty days. Week after week the flow\r\ncontinued, declining to six-hundred barrels a day in eighteen months.\r\nThe superintendent of the Noble & Delamater Oil Company—organized in\r\n1864 with a million capital—in February of 1865 recommended pulling out\r\nthe tubing and cleaning the well. Learning of this intention, Noble and\r\nDelamater unloaded their stock at or above par. The tubing was drawn,\r\nthe well pumped fifteen barrels in two days, came to a full stop and was\r\nabandoned as a dry-hole!\r\n\r\nThe production of this marvelous gusher—over seven-hundred-thousand\r\nbarrels—netted upwards of four-million dollars! One-fourth of this\r\nlordly sum went to the children of James Farrell—he did not live to see\r\nhis land developed—James, John, Nelson and their sister, now Mrs.\r\nWilliam B. Sterrett, of Titusville. Noble and Delamater owned one-half\r\nthe working-interest, less the sixteenth assigned to S. S. Fertig, who\r\nbought another sixteenth from John Farrell while drilling the well and\r\nsold both to William H. Abbott for twenty-seven-thousand dollars. Ten\r\npersons—L. L. Lamb, Solomon and W. H. Noble, Rev. L. Reed, James and L.\r\nH. Hall, Charles and Thomas Delamater, G. T. Churchhill and Rollin\r\nThompson—held almost one-quarter. Even this fractional claim gave each a\r\nsplendid income. The total outlay for the lease and well—not quite\r\nfour-thousand dollars—was repaid one-thousand times in twenty months! Is\r\nit surprising that men plunged into speculations which completely\r\neclipsed the South-Sea Bubble and Law’s Mississippi-Scheme? Is it any\r\nwonder that multitudes were eager to stake their last dollar, their\r\nhealth, their lives, their very souls on the chance of such winnings?\r\n\r\nThirteen wells were drilled on the Farrell strip. The Craft had yielded\r\na hundred-thousand barrels and was doing two-hundred a day when the\r\nseed-bag burst, flooding the well with water and driving the oil away.\r\nThe Mulligan and the Commercial did their share towards making the\r\nterritory the finest property in Oildom, with third sand on the flats\r\nand in the ravine of Bull Run forty feet thick. Not a fragment of tanks\r\nor derricks is left to indicate that twenty fortunes were acquired on\r\nthe desolate spot, once the scene of tremendous activity, more coveted\r\nthan Naboth’s vineyard or Jason’s Golden Fleece. On the Caldwell farm of\r\ntwo-hundred acres, south of the Farrell, twenty-five or thirty wells\r\nyielded largely. The Caldwell, finished in March of 1863, at the\r\nnorth-west corner of the tract, flowed twelve-hundred barrels a day for\r\nsix weeks. Evidently deriving its supply from the same pool, the Noble\r\nwell cut this down to four-hundred barrels. A demand for one-fourth the\r\noutput of the Noble, enforced by a threat to pull the tubing and destroy\r\nthe two, was settled by paying one-hundred-and-forty-five-thousand\r\ndollars for the Caldwell well and an acre of ground. “Growing smaller by\r\ndegrees and beautifully less,” within a month of the transfer the\r\nCaldwell quit forever, drained as dry as the bones in Ezekiel’s vision!\r\n\r\nHon. Orange Noble, the son of a New-York farmer, dealt in sheep and\r\ncattle, married in 1841 and in 1852 removed to Randolph, Crawford\r\ncounty, Pa. He farmed, manufactured “shooks” and in 1855 opened a store\r\nat Townville in partnership with George B. Delamater. The partners and\r\nL. L. Lamb inspected the Drake well in October of 1859, secured leases\r\non the Stackpole and Jones farms and drilled two dry-holes. Other wells\r\non different farms in 1860-1 resulted similarly, but the Noble\r\ncompensated richly for these failures. The firm wound up the\r\nestablishment at Townville in 1863, squared petroleum-accounts, and in\r\n1864 Mr. Noble located at Erie. There he organized banks, erected\r\nmassive blocks, served as mayor three terms, built the first grain\r\nelevator and contributed greatly to the prosperity of the city. Blessed\r\nwith ample wealth—the Noble well paid him eight-hundred-thousand\r\ndollars—a vigorous constitution and the regard of his fellows, he has\r\nlived to a ripe age to enjoy the fruits of his patient industry and\r\nremarkable success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE W. DELAMATER.]\r\n\r\nHon. George B. Delamater, whose parents settled in Crawford county in\r\n1822, studied law and was admitted to the Meadville bar in 1847. He\r\npublished a newspaper at Youngsville, Warren county, two years and in\r\n1852 started in business at Townville. Clients were not plentiful in\r\nthe quiet village, where a lawsuit was a luxury, and the young\r\nattorney found boring juries much less remunerative than he afterwards\r\nfound boring oil-wells. Returning to Meadville in 1864, with\r\nseven-hundred-thousand dollars and some real-estate at his command, he\r\nbuilt the magnificent Delamater Block, opened a bank, promoted many\r\nimportant enterprises and engaged actively in politics. Selected to\r\noppose George K. Anderson—he, too, had a bar’l—for the State Senate in\r\n1869, Delamater carried off the prize. It was a case of Greek meeting\r\nGreek. Money flowed like water, Anderson spending thirty-thousand\r\ndollars and his opponent twenty-eight-thousand on the primaries alone!\r\nThis was the beginning of the depletion of the Delamater fortune and\r\nthe political demoralization that scandalized Crawford county for\r\nyears. Mr. Delamater served one term, declined to run again and\r\nAnderson succeeded him. His son, George W., a young lawyer of ability\r\nand superior address, entered the lists and was elected Mayor of\r\nMeadville and State-Senator. He married an accomplished lady, occupied\r\na brick-mansion, operated at Petrolia, practiced law and assisted in\r\nrunning the bank. Samuel B. Dick headed a faction that opposed the\r\nDelamaters bitterly. Nominated for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1890,\r\nGeorge W. Delamater was defeated by Robert E. Pattison. He conducted\r\nan aggressive campaign, visiting every section of the state and\r\nwinning friends by his frank courtesy and manly bearing. Ruined by\r\npolitics, unable longer to stand the drain that had been sapping its\r\nresources, the Delamater Bank suspended two weeks after the\r\ngubernatorial election. The brick-block, the homes of the parents and\r\nthe sons, the assets of the concern—mere drops in the bucket—met a\r\ntrifling percentage of the liabilities. Property was sacrificed, suits\r\nwere entered and dismissed, savings of depositors were swept away and\r\nthe failure entailed a host of serious losses. The senior Delamater\r\nwent to Ohio to start life anew at seventy-one. George W. located in\r\nChicago and quickly gathered a law-practice. That he will regain\r\nwealth and honor, pay off every creditor and some day represent his\r\ndistrict in Congress those who know him best are not unwilling to\r\nbelieve. The fall of the Delamater family—the beggary of the aged\r\nfather—the crushing of the son’s honorable ambition—the exile from\r\nhome and friends—the suffering of innocent victims—all these\r\nillustrate the sad reverses which, in the oil-region, have “come, not\r\nsingle spies, but in battalions.”\r\n\r\nJames Bonner, son of an Ohio clergyman and book-keeper for Noble &\r\nDelamater, lodged in the firm’s new office beside the well. Seized with\r\ntyphoid fever, his recovery was hopeless. The office caught fire, young\r\nBonner’s father carried him to the window, a board was placed to slide\r\nhim down and he expired in a few moments. His father, overcome by smoke,\r\nwas rescued with difficulty; his mother escaped by jumping from the\r\nsecond story.\r\n\r\nJames Foster owned sixty acres on the west side of Oil Creek, opposite\r\nthe Farrell and Caldwell tracts. The upper half, extending over the hill\r\nto Pioneer Run, he sold to the Irwin Petroleum Company of Philadelphia,\r\nwhose Irwin well pumped two-hundred barrels a day. The Porter well,\r\nfinished in May of 1864, flowed all summer, gradually declining from\r\ntwo-hundred barrels to seventy and finally pumping twenty. Other wells\r\nand a refinery paid good dividends. J. W. Sherman, of Cleveland, leased\r\nthe lower end of the farm and bounced the “spring-pole” in the winter of\r\n1861-2. His wife’s money and his own played out before the second sand\r\nwas penetrated. It was impossible to drill deeper “by hand-power.” A\r\nhorse or an engine must be had to work the tools. “Pete,” a white,\r\nangular equine, was procured for one-sixteenth interest in the well. The\r\ntask becoming too heavy for “Pete,” another sixteenth was traded to\r\nWilliam Avery and J. E. Steele for a small engine and boiler. Lack of\r\nmeans to buy coal—an expensive article, sold only for “spot cash”—caused\r\na week’s delay. The owners of the well could not muster “long green” to\r\npay for one ton of fuel! For another sixteenth a purchaser grudgingly\r\nsurrendered eighty dollars and a shot-gun! The last dollar had been\r\nexpended when, on March sixteenth, 1862—just in season to celebrate St.\r\nPatrick’s day—the tools punctured the third sand. A “crevice” was hit,\r\nthe tools were drawn out and in five minutes everything swam in oil. The\r\nSherman well was flowing two-thousand barrels a day! Borrowing the\r\nphrase of the parrot stripped of his feathers and blown five-hundred\r\nfeet by a powder-explosion, people might well exclaim: “This beats the\r\nOld Scratch!”\r\n\r\nTo provide tankage was the first concern. Teams were dispatched for\r\nlumber and carpenters hurried to the scene. Near the well a mudhole,\r\nbetween two stumps, could not be avoided. In this one of the wagons\r\nstuck fast and had to be pried out, John A. Mather chanced to come along\r\nwith his photograph apparatus. The men posed an instant, the horses\r\n“looked pleasant,” the wagon didn’t stir and he secured the artistic\r\npicture reproduced here thirty-five years after. It is an interesting\r\nsouvenir of former times—times that deserve the best work of pen and\r\npencil, camera and brush, “to hold them in everlasting remembrance.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STUCK IN A MUDHOLE NEAR THE SHERMAN WELL IN 1862.]\r\n\r\nThe Sherman well “whooped it up” bravely, averaging nine-hundred barrels\r\ndaily for two years and ceasing to spout in February of 1864. Pumping\r\nrestored it to seventy-five barrels, which dwindled to six or eight in\r\n1867, when fire consumed the rig and the veteran was abandoned. The\r\nproduct sold at prices ranging from fifty cents to thirteen dollars a\r\nbarrel, the total aggregating seventeen-hundred-thousand dollars! How\r\nwas that for a return? It meant one-hundred-thousand dollars for the man\r\nwho traded “Pete,” one-hundred-thousand for the man who invested eighty\r\ndollars and a rusty gun, one-hundred-thousand for the two men who\r\nfurnished the second-hand engine, and a million—deducting the\r\nroyalty—for the man who had neither cash nor credit for a load of coal!\r\n\r\nNone of the other fifty or sixty wells on the Foster farm, some of them\r\nSherman’s, was particularly noteworthy. The broad flat, the sluggish\r\nstream and the bluffs across the creek remain as in days of yore, but\r\nthe wells, the shanties, the tanks, the machinery and the workmen have\r\nvanished. Sherman, long hale and hearty, struck a spouter in Kentucky,\r\noperated two or three years at Bradford and took up his abode at Warren.\r\nIt was a treat to hear his vivid descriptions of life on Oil Creek in\r\nthe infancy of developments—life crowded with transformations far\r\nsurpassing the fantastic changes of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” He died\r\nat Cleveland last year.\r\n\r\nAmong the teamsters who hauled oil from the Sherman well in its prime\r\nwas “Con” O’Donnell, a fun-loving, impulsive Irishman. He saved his\r\nearnings, secured leases for himself, owned a bevy of wells at Kane City\r\nand operated in the Clarion field. Marrying a young lady of\r\nEllicottville, N. Y., his early home, he lived some years at Foxburg and\r\nSt. Petersburg. He was the rarest of practical jokers and universally\r\nesteemed. Softening of the brain afflicted him for years, death at last\r\nstilling as warm and kindly a heart as ever throbbed in a manly breast.\r\n“Con” often regaled me with his droll witticisms as we rode or drove\r\nthrough the Clarion district. “Peace to his ashes.”\r\n\r\nLate in the fall of 1859, “when th’ frost wuz on th’ punkin’ an’ th’\r\nbloom wuz on th’ rye,” David McElhenny sold the upper and lower\r\nMcElhenny farms—one-hundred-and-eighty acres at the south-east corner of\r\nCherrytree township—to Captain A. B. Funk, for fifteen-hundred dollars\r\nand one-fourth of the oil. Joining the Foster farm on the north, Oil\r\nCreek bounded the upper tract on the east and south and Pioneer Run\r\ngurgled through the western side. Oil Creek flowed through the northern\r\nand western sides of the lower half, which had the Espy farm on the\r\neast, the Boyd south and the Benninghoff north and west. McElhenny’s\r\nfaith in petroleum was of the mustard-seed order and he jumped at Hussey\r\n& McBride’s offer of twenty-thousand dollars for the royalty. Captain\r\nFunk—he obtained the title from running steamboats lumbering on the\r\nYoughiogheny river—in February of 1860 commenced the first well on the\r\nlower McElhenny farm. All spring and summer the “spring-pole” bobbed\r\nserenely, punching the hole two-hundred-and-sixty feet, with no\r\nsuspicion of oil in the first and second sands. The Captain, believing\r\nit a rank failure, would gladly have exchanged the hole “for a yellow\r\ndog.” His son, A. P. Funk, bought a small locomotive-boiler and an\r\nengine and resumed work during the winter. Early in May, 1861, at\r\nfour-hundred feet, a “pebble rock”—the “third sand”—tested the temper of\r\nthe center-bit. Hope, the stuff that “springs eternal in the human\r\nbreast,” took a fresh hold. It languished as the tools bored thirty,\r\nforty, fifty feet into the “pebble” and not a drop of oil appeared. Then\r\nsomething happened. Flecks of foam bubbled to the top of the conductor,\r\njets of water rushed out, oil and water succeeded and a huge pillar of\r\npure oil soared fifty yards! The Fountain well had tapped a fountain in\r\nthe rock ordained thenceforth to furnish mankind with Pennsylvania\r\npetroleum. The _first well put down to_ “the third sand,” and really the\r\n_first on Oil Creek that flowed_ from any sand, it revealed\r\noil-possibilities before unknown and unsuspected.\r\n\r\nMore tangible than the mythical Fountain of Youth, the Fountain well\r\ntallied three-hundred barrels a day for fifteen months. The flow ended\r\nas suddenly as it began. Paraffine clogged and strangled it to death,\r\nsealing the pores and pipes effectually. A young man “taught the young\r\nidea how to shoot” at Steam Mills, east of Titusville, where Captain\r\nFunk had lumber-mills. A visit to the Drake and Barnsdall wells, in\r\nDecember of 1859, determined the schoolmaster to have an oil-well of his\r\nown. Funk liked the earnest, manly youth and leased him five acres of\r\nthe upper McElhenny farm. Plenty of brains, a brave heart, robust\r\nhealth, willing hands and thirty dollars constituted his capital.\r\nSecuring two partners, “kicking down” started in the spring of 1860. Not\r\na sign of oil could be detected at two-hundred feet, and the partners\r\ndeparted from the field. Summer and the teacher’s humble savings were\r\ngone. He earned more money by drilling on the Allegheny river, four\r\nmiles above Oil City. While thus engaged the Fountain well\r\nrevolutionized the business by “flowing” from a lower rock. The\r\nex-wielder of the birch—he had resigned the ferrule for the\r\n“spring-pole”—hastened to sink the deserted well to the depth of Funk’s\r\neye-opener. The second three-hundred-barrel gusher from the third sand,\r\nit rivaled the Fountain and arrived in time to help 1861 crimson the\r\nglorious Fourth!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN FERTIG.        \\CAPT. A. B. FUNK.]\r\n\r\nHon. John Fertig, of Titusville, the plucky schoolmaster of 1859-60,\r\nhas been largely identified with oil ever since his initiation on the\r\nMcElhenny lease. The Fertig well, in which David Beatty and Michael\r\nGorman were his partners originally, realized him a fortune. Born in\r\nVenango county, on a farm below Gas City, in 1837, he completed a\r\ncourse at Neilltown Academy and taught school several terms. Soon\r\nafter embarking in the production of oil he formed a partnership with\r\nthe late John W. Hammond, which lasted until dissolved by death twenty\r\nyears later. Fertig & Hammond operated in different sections with\r\ngreat success, carried on a refinery and established a bank at\r\nFoxburg. Mr. Fertig was Mayor of Titusville three terms,\r\nSchool-Controller, State Senator and Democratic candidate for\r\nLieutenant-Governor in 1878. He has been vice-president of the\r\nCommercial Bank from its organization in 1882 and is president of the\r\nTitusville Iron-Works. Head of the National Oil-Company, he was also\r\nchief officer of the Union Oil-Company, an association of refining\r\ncompanies. For three years its treasurer—1892-5—he tided the\r\nUnited-States Pipe-Line Company over a financial crisis in 1893. As a\r\npioneer producer—one of the few survivors connected with developments\r\nfor a generation—a refiner and shipper, banker, manufacturer and\r\nbusiness-man, John Fertig is most distinctively a representative of\r\nthe oil-country. From first to last he has been admirably prudent and\r\naggressive, conservative and enterprising in shaping a career with\r\nmuch to cherish and little to regret.\r\n\r\nFrederick Crocker drilled a notable well on the McElhenny, near the\r\nFoster line, jigging the “spring-pole” in 1861 and piercing the sand at\r\none-hundred-and-fifty feet. He pumped the well incessantly two months,\r\ngetting clear water for his pains. Neighbors jeered, asked if he\r\nproposed to empty the interior of the planet into the creek and advised\r\nhim to import a Baptist colony. Crocker pegged away, remembering that\r\n“he laughs best who laughs last.” One morning the water wore a tinge of\r\ngreen. The color deepened, the gas “cut loose,” and a stream of oil shot\r\nupwards! The Crocker well spurted for weeks at a thousand-barrel clip\r\nand was sold for sixty-five-thousand dollars. Shutting in the flow, to\r\nprevent waste, wrought serious injury. The well disliked the treatment,\r\nthe gas sought a vent elsewhere, pumping coaxed back the yield\r\ntemporarily to fifty barrels and in the fall it yielded up the ghost.\r\n\r\nBennett & Hatch spent the summer of 1861 drilling on a lease adjoining\r\nthe Fountain, striking the third sand at the same depth. On September\r\neighteenth the well burst forth with thirty-three-hundred barrels per\r\nday! This was “confusion worse confounded,” foreigners not wanting “the\r\nnasty stuff” and Americans not yet aware of its real value. The addition\r\nof three-thousand barrels a day to the supply—with big additions from\r\nother wells—knocked prices to twenty cents, to fifteen, to ten! All the\r\ncoopers in Oildom could not make barrels as fast as the Empire\r\nwell—appropriate name—could fill them. Bradley & Son, of Cleveland,\r\nbought a month’s output for five-hundred dollars, loading\r\none-hundred-thousand barrels into boats under their contract! The\r\ndespairing owners, suffering from “an embarrassment of riches,” tried to\r\ncork up the pesky thing, but the well was like Xantippe, the scolding\r\nwife of Socrates, and would not be choked off. They built a dam around\r\nit, but the oil wouldn’t be dammed that way. It just gorged the pond,\r\nran over the embankment and greased Oil Creek as no stream was ever\r\ngreased before! Twenty-two-hundred barrels was the daily average in\r\nNovember and twelve-hundred in March. The torrent played April-fool by\r\nstopping without notice, seven months from its inception. Cleaning out\r\nand pumping restored it to six-hundred barrels, which dropped two-thirds\r\nand stopped again in 1863. An “air blower” revived it briefly, but its\r\nvitality had fled and in another year the grand Empire breathed its\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nThese wells boomed the territory immensely. Derricks and engine-houses\r\nstudded the McElhenny farms, which operators hustled to perforate as\r\nfull of holes as a strainer. To haul machinery from the nearest railroad\r\ndoubled its cost. Pumping five to twenty barrels a day, when adjacent\r\nwells flowed more hundreds spontaneously, lost its charm and most of the\r\nsmall fry were abandoned. Everybody wanted to get close to the\r\nthird-sand spouters, although the market was glutted and crude ruinously\r\ncheap. A town—Funkville—arose on the northern end of the upper farm,\r\nsputtered a year or two, then “folded its tent like the Arabs and\r\nsilently stole away.” A search with a microscope would fail to unearth\r\nan atom of Funkville or the wells that created it. Fresh strikes in 1862\r\nkept the fever raging. Davis & Wheelock’s rattler daily poured out\r\nfifteen-hundred barrels. The Densmore triplets, bunched on a two-acre\r\nlease, were good for six-hundred, four-hundred and five-hundred\r\nrespectively. The Olmstead, American, Canfield, Aikens, Burtis and two\r\nHibbard wells, of the vintage of 1863, rated from two-hundred to\r\nfive-hundred each. A band of less account—thirty to one-hundred\r\nbarrels—assisted in holding the daily product of the McElhenny farms,\r\nfrom the spring of 1862 to the end of 1863, considerably above\r\nsix-thousand barrels. The mockery of fate was accentuated by a dry-hole\r\nsix rods from the Sherman and dozens of poor wells in the bosom of the\r\nbig fellows. Disposing of his timber-lands and saw-mills in 1863,\r\nCaptain Funk built a mansion and removed to Titusville. Early in 1864 he\r\nsold his wells and oil-properties and died on August second, leaving an\r\nestate of two-millions. He built schools and churches, dispensed freely\r\nto the needy and was honest to the core. Pleased with the work of a\r\nclerk, he deeded him an interest in the last well he ever drilled, which\r\nthe lucky young man sold for one-hundred-thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the Empire, in September of 1861, the Buckeye\r\nwell, on the George P. Espy farm, east of lower McElhenney, set off at a\r\nthousand-barrel jog. It was located on a strip of level ground too\r\nnarrow for tanks, which had to be erected two-hundred feet up the hill.\r\nThe pressure of gas sufficed to force the oil into these tanks for a\r\nyear. The production fell to eighty barrels and then, tiring of a\r\nclimbing job that smacked of Sisyphus and the rolling stone, took a\r\npermanent rest. From this famous well J. T. Briggs, manager of the\r\nBriggs and the Gillettee Oil-Companies, shipped to Europe in 1862 the\r\nfirst cargo of petroleum ever sent across the Atlantic. The Buckeye\r\nBelle stood about hip-high to its consort, a dozen other wells on the\r\nEpsy produced mildly and Northrup Brothers operated a refinery.\r\n\r\n     “Vare vos dose oil-wells now? Gone vhare dogs can’t bow-wow.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PIONEER AS IT LOOKED IN 1864-5.]\r\n\r\nImproved methods of handling and new uses for the product advanced crude\r\nto five dollars in the spring of 1864. Operations encroached upon the\r\nhigher lands, exploding the notion that paying territory was confined to\r\nflats bordering the streams. Pioneer Run, an affluent of Oil Creek,\r\nbisecting the western end of the upper McElhenney and Foster farms,\r\npanned out flatteringly. Substantial wells, yielding fifteen barrels to\r\nthree-hundred lined the ravine thickly. The town of Pioneer attracted\r\nthe usual throngs. David Emery and Lewis Emery, Frank W. Andrews and not\r\na few leading operators resided there for a time. The Morgan House, a\r\nrude frame of one story, dished up meals at which to eat beef-hash was\r\nto beefashionable. Clark & McGowen had a feed-store, offices and\r\nwarehouses abounded, tanks and derricks mixed in the mass and boats\r\nloaded oil for refineries down the creek or the Allegheny river. The\r\ncharacteristic oil-town has faded from sight, only the weather-beaten\r\nrail road-station and a forlorn iron-tank staying. John Rhodes, the last\r\nresident, was killed in February of 1892 by a train. He lived alone in a\r\nsmall house beside the track, which he was crossing when the engine hit\r\nhim, the noisy waters in the culvert drowning the sound of the cars.\r\nRhodes hauled oil in the old days to Erie and Titusville, became a\r\nproducer, met with reverses, attended to some wells for a company,\r\nworked a bit of garden and felt independent and happy.\r\n\r\nMatthew Taylor, a Cleveland saloonist, whom the sequel showed to be no\r\nsaloonatic, took a four-hundred-dollar flyer at Pioneer, on his first\r\nvisit to Oildom. A well on the next lease elevated values and Taylor\r\nreturned home in two weeks with twenty-thousand dollars, which\r\nsubsequent deals quadrupled. A Titusville laborer—“a broth of a b’y wan\r\nyear frum Oireland”—who stuck fifty dollars into an out-of-the-way\r\nPioneer lot, sold his claim in a month for five-thousand. He bought a\r\nfarm, sent across the water for his colleen and “they lived happily ever\r\nafter.” The driver of a contractor’s team, assigned an interest in a\r\ndrilling-well for his wages, cleaned up thirty-thousand dollars by the\r\ntransaction and went to Minnesota. Could the mellowest melodrama unfold\r\nsweeter melodies?\r\n\r\n             “The jingle of gold is earth’s richest music.”\r\n\r\nAlthough surrounded by farms unrivaled as oil-territory and sold to\r\nWoods & Wright of New York at a fancy price, James Boyd’s seventy-five\r\nacres in Cornplanter township, south of the lower McElhenny, dodged the\r\npetroleum-artery. The sands were there, but so barren of oil that\r\nnine-tenths of the forty wells did not pay one-tenth their cost. The\r\nBoyd farm was for months the terminus of the railroad from Corry. Hotels\r\nand refineries were built and the place had a short existence, a brief\r\ninterval separating its lying-in and its laying-out.\r\n\r\nG. W. McClintock, in February of 1864, sold his two-hundred-acre farm,\r\non the west side of Oil Creek, midway between Titusville and Oil City,\r\nto the Central Petroleum Company of New York, organized by Frederic\r\nPrentice and George H. Bissell. This notable farm embraced the site of\r\nPetroleum Centre and Wild-Cat Hollow, a circular ravine three-fourths of\r\na mile long, in which two-hundred paying wells were drilled. Brown,\r\nCatlin & Co.’s medium well, finished in August of 1861, was the first on\r\nthe McClintock tract. The company bored a multitude of wells and granted\r\nleases only to actual operators, for one-half royalty and a large bonus.\r\nFor ten one-acre leases one-hundred-thousand dollars cash and one-half\r\nthe oil, offered by a New-York firm in 1865, were refused. The\r\nMcClintock well, drilled in 1862, figured in the thousand-barrel class.\r\nThe Coldwater, Meyer, Clark, Anderson, Fox, Swamp-Angel and Bluff wells\r\nmade splendid records. Altogether the Central Petroleum-Company and the\r\ncorps of lessees harvested at least five-millions of dollars from the\r\nMcClintock farm!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          RYND FARM       “KING OF THE HILLS”\r\n              PETROLEUM CENTRE-1894-\r\n           BOYD FARM-1864\r\n                                     STORY FARM.\r\n\r\nAladdin’s lamp was a miserly glim in the light of fortunes accruing from\r\npetroleum. The product of a flowing-well in a year would buy a tract of\r\ngold-territory in California or Australia larger than the oil-producing\r\nregions. Millions of dollars changed hands every week. The Central\r\nCompany staked off a half-dozen streets and leased building-lots at\r\nexorbitant figures. Board-dwellings, offices, hotels, saloons and wells\r\nmingled promiscuously. It mattered nothing that discomfort was the rule.\r\nPoor fare, worse beds and the worst liquors were tolerated by the hordes\r\nof people who flocked to the land of derricks. Edward Fox, a railroad\r\ncontractor who “struck the town” with eighty-thousand dollars,\r\nfelicitously baptised the bantling Petroleum Centre. The owners of the\r\nground opposed a borough-organization and the town traveled at a\r\nheadlong go-as-you-please. Sharpers and prostitutes flourished, with no\r\nfear of human or divine law, in the metropolis of rum and debauchery.\r\nDance-houses, beside which “Billy” McGlory’s Armory-Hall and “The.”\r\nAllen’s Mabille in New York were Sunday-school models, nightly counted\r\ntheir revelers by hundreds. In one of these dens Gus Reil, the\r\nproprietor, killed poor young Tait, of Rouseville. Fast women and faster\r\nmen caroused and gambled, cursed and smoked, “burning the candle at both\r\nends” in pursuit of—pleasure! Frequently the orgies eclipsed Monte\r\nCarlo—minus some of the glitter—and the Latin Quartier combined. Some\r\nreaders may recall the night two “dead game sports” tossed dice twelve\r\nhours for one-thousand dollars a throw! But there was a rich leaven of\r\nfirst-class fellows. Kindred spirits, like “Sam” Woods, Frank Ripley,\r\nEdward Fox and Col. Brady were not hard to discover. Spades were trumps\r\nlong years ago for Woods, who has taken his last trick and sleeps in an\r\nOhio grave. Ripley is in Duluth, Fox is “out west” and Brady is in\r\nHarrisburg. Captain Ray and A. D. Cotton had a bank that handled barrels\r\nof money. For two or three years “The Centre”—called that for convenient\r\nbrevity—acted as a sort of safety-valve to blow off the surplus\r\nwickedness of the oil-regions. Then “the handwriting on the wall”\r\nmanifested itself. Clarion and Butler speedily reduced the four-thousand\r\npopulation to a mere remnant. The local paper died, houses were removed\r\nand the giddy Centre became “a back number.” The sounds of revelry were\r\nhushed, flickering lights no longer glared over painted harlots and the\r\nstreets were deserted. Bissell’s empty bank-building, three dwellings,\r\nthe public school, two vacant churches and the drygoods box used as a\r\nrailway-station—scarcely enough to cast a shadow—are the sole survivors\r\nin the ploughed field that was once bustling, blooming, surging, foaming\r\nPetroleum Centre!\r\n\r\nAcross the creek from Petroleum Centre, on the east side of the stream,\r\nwas Alexander Davidson’s farm of thirty-eight acres. A portion of this\r\ntriangular “speck on the map” consisted of a mud-flat, a smaller portion\r\nof rising ground and the remainder set edgewise. Dr. A. G. Egbert, a\r\nyoung physician who had recently hung out his shingle at Cherrytree\r\nvillage, in 1860 negotiated for the farm. Davidson died and a hitch in\r\nthe title delayed the deal. Finally Mrs. Davidson agreed to sign the\r\ndeed for twenty-six-hundred dollars and one-twelfth the oil. Charles\r\nHyde paid the doctor this amount in 1862 for one-half his purchase and\r\nit was termed the Hyde & Egbert farm. The Hollister well, drilled in\r\n1861, the first on the land, flowed strongly. Owing to the dearness and\r\nscarcity of barrels, the oil was let run into the creek and the well was\r\nnever tested. The lessees could not afford, as their contract demanded,\r\nto barrel the half due the land-owners, because crude was selling at\r\ntwenty-five cents and barrels at three-fifty to four dollars! A company\r\nof Jerseyites, in the spring of 1863, drilled the Jersey well, on the\r\nsouth end of the property. The Jersey—it was a Jersey Lily—flowed\r\nthree-hundred barrels a day for nine months, another well draining it\r\nearly in 1864. The Maple-Shade, which cast the majority into the shade\r\nby its performance, touched the right spot in the third sand on August\r\nfifth, 1863. Starting at one-thousand barrels, it averaged eight-hundred\r\nfor ten months, dropped to fifty the second year and held on until 1869.\r\nFire on March second, 1864, burned the rig and twenty-eight tanks of\r\noil, but the well kept flowing just the same, netting the owners a clear\r\nprofit of fifteen-hundred-thousand dollars! “Do you notice it?” A plump\r\nmillion-and-a-half from a corner of the “measly patch” poor Davidson\r\noffered in 1860 for one-thousand dollars! And the Maple Shade was only\r\none of twenty-three flowing wells on the despised thirty-eight acres!\r\n\r\nCompanies and individuals tugged and strained to get even the smallest\r\nlease Hyde & Egbert would grant. The Keystone, Gettysburg, Kepler,\r\nEagle, Benton, Olive Branch, Laurel Hill, Bird and Potts wells, not to\r\nmention a score of minor note, helped maintain a production that paid\r\nthe holders of the royalty eight-thousand dollars a day in 1864-5! E. B.\r\nGrandin and William C. Hyde, partners of Charles Hyde in a store at\r\nHydetown, A. C. Kepler and Titus Ridgway obtained a lease of one acre on\r\nthe west side of the lot, north of the wells already down, subject to\r\n_three-quarters royalty_. A bit of romance attaches to the transaction.\r\nKepler dreamed that an Indian menaced him with bow and arrow. A young\r\nlady, considered somewhat coquettish, handed him a rifle and he fired at\r\nthe dusky foe. The redskin vamoosed and a stream of oil burst forth.\r\nVisiting his brother, who superintended the farm, he recognized the\r\nscene of his dream. The lease was secured, on the biggest royalty ever\r\noffered. Kepler chose the location and bored the Coquette well. The\r\ndream was a nightmare? Wait and see.\r\n\r\nDrilling began in the spring of 1864 and the work went merrily on. Each\r\npartner would be entitled to one-sixteenth of the oil. Hyde & Ridgway\r\nsold their interest for ten-thousand dollars a few days before the tools\r\nreached the sand. This interest Dr. M. C. Egbert, brother of the\r\noriginal purchaser of the farm, next bought at a large advance. He had\r\nacquired one-sixth of the property in fee and wished to own the\r\nCoquette. Grandin and Kepler declined to sell. The well was finished and\r\ndid not flow! Tubed and pumped a week, gas checked its working and the\r\nsucker-rods were pulled. Immediately the oil streamed high in the air!\r\nTwelve-hundred barrels a day was the gauge at first, settling to steady\r\nbusiness for a year at eight-hundred. A double row of tanks lined the\r\nbank, connected by pipes to load boats in bulk. Oil was “on the jump”\r\nand the first cargo of ten-thousand barrels brought ninety-thousand\r\ndollars, representing ten days’ production! Three months later Grandin\r\nand Kepler sold their one-eighth for one-hundred-and-forty-five thousand\r\ndollars, quitting the Coquette with eighty-thousand apiece in their\r\npockets. Kepler was a dreamer whom Joseph might be proud to accept as a\r\nchum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. M. C. EGBERT.]\r\n\r\nDr. M. C. Egbert retained his share. Riches showered upon him. His\r\ninterests in the land and wells yielded him thousands of dollars a day.\r\nOnce his safe contained, by tight squeezing, eighteen-hundred-thousand\r\ndollars in currency and a pile of government bonds! He built a\r\ncomfortable house and lived on the farm. He and his family traveled over\r\nEurope, met shoals of titled folks and saw all the sights. In company\r\nwith John Brown, subsequently manager of a big corporation at Bradford\r\nand now a resident of Chicago, he engaged in oil-shipments on an\r\nextensive scale. To control this branch of the trade, as the Standard\r\nOil-Company has since done by combinations of capital, was too gigantic\r\na task for the firm and failure resulted. The brainy, courageous doctor\r\nwent to California, returned to Oildom and operated in McKean county. He\r\nhas secured a foothold in the newer fields and lives in Pittsburg, frank\r\nand urbane as in the palmiest days of the Hyde & Egbert farm. If Dame\r\nFortune was strangely capricious on Oil Creek, the pluck of the men with\r\nwhom “the fickle jade” played whirligig was surely admirable.\r\n\r\nProbably no parcel of ground in America of equal size ever yielded a\r\nlarger return, in proportion to the expenditure, than the Hyde & Egbert\r\ntract. Six weeks’ production of the Coquette or Maple Shade would drill\r\nall the wells on the property. Charles Hyde and Dr. A. G. Egbert cleared\r\nat least three-million dollars, the latter selling one-twelfth of the\r\nCoquette alone for a quarter-million cash. Profits of others interested\r\nin the land and of the lessees trebled this alluring sum. The\r\naggregate—eight to ten millions—in silver-dollars would load a\r\nfreight-train or build a column twenty miles high! Fused into a lump of\r\ngold, a dozen mules might well decline the task of drawing it a mile.\r\nDone up into a bundle of five-dollar bills, Hercules couldn’t budge the\r\nbulky package. A “promoter” of the Mulberry-Sellers brand wanted an\r\nowner of the farm, when the wells were at their best, to launch the\r\nwhole thing into a stock-company with five-millions capital. “Bah!”\r\nresponded the gentleman, “five millions—did you say five-millions? Don’t\r\nwaste your breath talking until you can come around with twenty-five\r\nmillions!”\r\n\r\nA native of New-York, born in 1822, Charles Hyde was fifteen when the\r\nfamily settled on a farm two miles south of Titusville, now occupied by\r\nthe Octave Oil-Company. At twenty he engaged with his father and two\r\nbrothers, W. C. and E. B. Hyde, in merchandising, lumbering and the\r\nmanufacture of salts from ashes. In 1846 he assumed charge of the\r\nlumber-mills John Titus sold the firm, originating the thrifty village\r\nof Hydetown, four miles above Titusville. The Hydes frequently procured\r\noil from the “springs” on Oil Creek, selling it for medicine as early as\r\n1840-1. From their Hydetown store Colonel Drake obtained some tools and\r\nsupplies Titusville could not furnish. Samuel Grandin, of Tidioute, in\r\nthe spring of 1860 induced Charles Hyde to buy a tenth-interest in the\r\nTidioute and Warren Oil-Company for one-thousand dollars. The company’s\r\nfirst well, of which he heard on his way to Pittsburg with a raft, laid\r\nthe foundation of Hyde’s great fortune in petroleum. He organized the\r\nHydetown Oil-Company, which leased the McClintock farm, below\r\nRouseville, from Jonathan Watson and drilled a two-hundred-barrel well\r\nin the summer of 1860. Mr. Hyde operated on the Clapp farm, south of\r\nMcClintock, and at different points on Oil Creek and the Allegheny\r\nRiver. His gains from the Hyde & Egbert farm approximated two-millions.\r\nStarting the Second National Bank of Titusville in 1865, he has always\r\nbeen its president and chief stockholder. In 1869 he removed to\r\nPlainfield, New Jersey, cultivating four-hundred acres of suburban land\r\nand maintaining an elegant home.\r\n\r\nDr. Albert G. Egbert, born in Mercer county in 1828, belonged to a\r\nfamily of eminent physicians, his grandfather, father, two uncles, three\r\nbrothers and one son practicing medicine. Predicating a future for oil\r\nupon the Drake well, his good judgment displayed itself promptly.\r\nAgreeing to purchase the Davison farm, which his modest income at\r\nCherrytree would not enable him to pay for, his sale of a half-interest\r\nto Charles Hyde provided the money to meet the entire claim. After the\r\nwonderful success of that investment the doctor located at Franklin. He\r\ncarried on oil-operations, farming and coal-mining and was always active\r\nin advancing the general welfare. Elected to Congress against immense\r\nodds, he served his district most capably, attending sedulously to his\r\nofficial duties and doing admirable work on committees. In public and\r\nprivate life he was enterprising and liberal, zealous for the right and\r\na helpful citizen. True to his convictions and professions, he never\r\nturned his back to friend or foe. To the steady, masterful purpose of\r\nmen like Dr. Egbert the oil-industry owes its rapid strides and\r\ncommanding position as a commercial staple. His demise on March\r\ntwenty-eighth, 1896, severs another of the links that bind the eventful\r\npast and the important present of petroleum. Early operators on Oil\r\nCreek are reduced to a handful of men whose heads are white with the\r\nsnows no July sun can melt.\r\n\r\n              “He has walk’d the way of nature;\r\n            The setting sun, and music at the close,\r\n            As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ISAAC N. PHILLIPS    CHARLES M. PHILLIPS    JOHN T. PHILLIPS\r\n  THOS. M. PHILLIPS\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe rich pickings around Petroleum Center set many on the straight\r\ncinder-path to prosperity. The four Phillips brothers—Isaac N., Charles\r\nM., John I. and Thomas M. came from Newcastle to coin money operating a\r\nfarm south of the Espy. Prolific wells on the Niagara tract, Cherrytree\r\nRun, back of the Benninghoff farm, added to their wealth. They cut a\r\nwide swath in all the Pennsylvania fields. Three of the brothers have\r\n“ascended to the hill of frankincense and to the mountain of myrrh.”\r\nThomas M. was a millionaire congressman. During the heated debates on\r\nfree-silver, in 1894, he scored the hit of the season by suggesting to\r\nconvert each barrel of Petroleum into legal-tender for a dollar and let\r\nit go at that. Crude was selling at sixty cents, which gave the Phillips\r\nproposition a point “sharper than a serpent’s tooth” or a Demosthenean\r\nphilippic. Dr. Egbert offered Isaac Phillips an interest in the Davidson\r\nfarm in 1862. The offer was not accepted instantly, Phillips saying he\r\nwould “consider it a few days.” Two weeks later he was ready to close\r\nthe deal, but the plum had fallen into the lap of Charles Hyde and\r\ndiverted prospective millions into another channel.\r\n\r\nGeorge K. Anderson figured conspicuously in this latitude, his receipts\r\nfor two years exceeding five-thousand dollars a day! He built a\r\nsumptuous residence at Titusville, sought political preferment and\r\nserved a term in the State Senate. Holding a vast block of\r\nPacific-Railroad stock, he was the bosom friend of the directors and\r\ntrusted lieutenant of William H. Kemble, the Philadelphia magnate whose\r\n“addition, division and silence” gave him notoriety. He bought thousands\r\nof acres of land, plunged deeply into stocks and insured his life for\r\nthree-hundred-and-fifteen-thousand dollars, at that time the largest\r\nrisk in the country. If he sneezed or coughed the agents of the\r\ninsurance-companies grew nervous and summoned a posse of doctors to\r\nconsult about the case. Outside speculations swamped him at last. The\r\nstately mansion, piles of bonds and scores of farms passed under the\r\nsheriff’s hammer in 1880. Plucky and unconquerable, Anderson tried his\r\nhand in the Bradford field, operating on Harrisburg Run. The result was\r\ndiscouraging and he entered an insurance-office in New York. Five years\r\nago he accepted a government-berth in New Mexico. Meeting him on\r\nBroadway the week before he left New York, his buoyant spirits seemed\r\ndepressed. He spoke regretfully of his approaching departure, yet hoped\r\nit might turn out advantageously. He arrived at his post, sickened and\r\ndied in a few days, “a stranger in a strange land.” Relatives and loved\r\nones were far away when he went down into the starless night of the\r\ngrave. No gentle wife or child or valued friend was there to smooth the\r\npillow of the dying man, to cool the fevered brow, to catch the last\r\nwhisper, to close the glassy eyes and fold the rigid hands above the\r\nlifeless breast. The oil-regions abound with pathetic experiences, but\r\nnone surpassing George K. Anderson’s. Wealthy beyond the dreams of\r\navarice, the courted politician, the confidant of presidents and\r\nstatesmen, a social favorite in Washington and Harrisburg, the owner of\r\na home beautiful as Claude Melnotte pictured to Pauline, he drained the\r\ncup of sorrow and misfortune. Reverses beset him, his riches took wings,\r\nbereavements bore heavily upon him, he was glad to secure a humble\r\nclerkship, and death ended the sad scene in a distant territory. Does\r\nnot human life contain more tears than smiles, more pain than pleasure,\r\nmore cloud than sunshine in the passage from the cradle to the tomb?\r\n\r\nFrank W. Andrews, born in Vermont and reared in Ohio, taught school in\r\nMissouri, hunted for gold at Pike’s Peak and landed on Oil Creek in the\r\nwinter of 1863-4. Hauling oil nine months supplied funds to operate on\r\nCherrytree Run. He drilled four dry holes. One on the McClintock farm\r\nand three more on Pithole Creek followed. This was not a flattering\r\nstart, but Andrews had lots of sand and persistence. Emerging from the\r\nPithole excitement with limited cash and unlimited machinery, he\r\nreturned to Oil Creek and operated extensively. His first well at\r\nPioneer flowed three-hundred barrels a day. Fifty others at Shamburg, on\r\nthe Benninghoff farm and Cherrytree Run brought him hundreds of\r\nthousands of dollars. He was rated at three-millions in 1870. Keeping up\r\nwith the tidal wave southward, he put down two-hundred wells in the\r\nFranklin, Clarion and Butler districts. Failures of banks and\r\nmanufactories in which he had a large stake shattered his fortune. With\r\nthe loss of money he did not lose his manliness and self-reliance. In\r\nthe Bradford region he pressed forward vigorously. Again he “plucked the\r\nflower of success” and was fast recuperating when thrown from his horse\r\nand fatally injured. Upright, unassuming and refined, Andrews merited\r\nthe confidence and esteem of all.\r\n\r\nThe bluff overlooking Petroleum Centre from the east formed the western\r\nside of the McCray farm. At its base, on the Hyde & Egbert plot, were\r\nseveral of the finest wells in Pennsylvania, the Coquette almost\r\ntouching McCray’s line. Dr. M. C. Egbert leased part of the slope and\r\ndrilled three wells. Other parties drilled five and the eight behaved so\r\nhandsomely that the owner of the land declined an offer, in 1865, of a\r\nhalf-million dollars for his eighty acres. A well on top of the hill,\r\nnot deep enough to hit the sand and supposed to be dry, postponed\r\nfurther operations five years. His friends distanced Jeremiah in their\r\nlamentations that McCray had spurned the five-hundred-thousand dollars.\r\nHe may have thought of Shakespeare’s “tide in the affairs of men,” but\r\nhe sawed wood and said nothing. Jonathan Watson, advised by a\r\nclairvoyant, in the spring of 1870 drilled a three-hundred-barrel well\r\non the uplands of the Dalzell farm, close to the southern boundary of\r\nthe McCray. The clairvoyant’s astonishing guess revived interest in\r\nPetroleum Centre, which for a year or two had been on the down grade.\r\nBesieged for leases, McCray could not meet a tithe of the demand at\r\none-thousand dollars an acre and half the oil. Derricks clustered\r\nthickly. Every well tapped the pool underlying fifteen acres, pumping as\r\nif drawing from a lake of petroleum. Within four months the daily\r\nproduction was three-thousand barrels. This meant nineteen-hundred\r\nbarrels for the land-owner—fifteen-hundred from royalty and four-hundred\r\nfrom wells he had drilled—a regular income of nine-thousand dollars a\r\nday! Cipher it out—nineteen-hundred barrels at four-fifty to five\r\ndollars, with eleven-hundred barrels for the lessees—and what do you\r\nfind? Fourteen-thousand dollars a day for the last quarter of 1870 and\r\nnine months of 1871, from one-sixth of a farm sold in 1850 for\r\nseventeen-hundred dollars! Say, how was that for high?\r\n\r\nJames S. McCray, a farmer’s son, born in 1824 on the flats below\r\nTitusville, at twenty-two set out for himself with two dollars in his\r\npocket. Working three years in a saw-mill on the Allegheny, he saved his\r\nearnings and in 1850 was able to buy a team and take up the farm decreed\r\nto enrich him beyond his wildest fancies. He married Miss Martha G.\r\nCrooks, a willing helpmeet in adversity and wise counsellor in\r\nprosperity. His first venture in oil, a share in a two-acre lease at\r\nRouseville, he sold to drill a well on the Blood farm, elbowing his own.\r\nFrom this he realized seventy-thousand dollars. For his own farm he\r\nrefused a million dollars in 1871. Sharpers dogged his footsteps and\r\nendeavored to rope him into all sorts of preposterous schemes. He told\r\nme one project, which was expected to control the coal-trade of the\r\nregion, bled him two-hundred-and-sixty-thousand dollars! Instead of\r\nselling his oil right along, at an average figure of nearly five\r\ndollars, he stored two-hundred-thousand barrels in iron-tanks, to await\r\nhigher prices. In my presence H. I. Beers, of McClintockville, bid him\r\nfive-thirty-five a barrel for the lot. McCray stuck out for five-fifty.\r\nHe kept the oil for years, losing thousands of barrels by leakage and\r\nevaporation, and sold the bulk of it at one to two dollars. Had he dealt\r\nwith Beers he would have been six-hundred-thousand dollars richer! Mr.\r\nMcCray removed to Franklin in 1872 and died some years ago. He rests in\r\nthe cemetery beside his faithful wife and only daughter. The wells on\r\nhis farm drooped and withered and the famous fifteen-acre field has long\r\nbeen a pasture. A robust character, strong-willed and kindly, sometimes\r\nqueerly contradictory and often misjudged, James S. McCray could adopt\r\nthe words of King Lear: “I am a man more sinned against than sinning.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HYDE & EGBERT TRACT AND McCRAY FARM IN 1870.\r\n  JAS. S. McCRAY FARM.       JAS. S. McCRAY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Dalzell or Hayes farm, on which the first well—fifty barrels—was\r\ndrilled in 1861, boasted the Porcupine, Rhinoceros, Ramcat, Wildcat, and\r\na menagerie of thirty others ranging from ten barrels to three-hundred.\r\nAt the north end of the farm, in the rear of the Maple-Shade and Jersey\r\nwells, the Petroleum Shaft-and-Mining-Company attempted to sink a hole\r\nseven feet by seventeen to the third sand. The shaft was dug and blasted\r\none-hundred feet, at immense cost. The funds ran out, gas threatened to\r\nasphyxiate the workmen, the big pumps could not exhaust the water and\r\nthe absurd undertaking was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Story farm does not lack romantic ingredients. William\r\nStory owned five-hundred acres south of the G. W. McClintock farm, Oil\r\nCreek, the Dalzell and Tarr farms bounding his land on the east. He sold\r\nin 1859 to Ritchie, Hartje & Co., of Pittsburg, for thirty-thousand\r\ndollars. George H. Bissell had negotiated for the property, but Mrs.\r\nStory objected to signing the deed. Next day Bissell returned to offer\r\nthe wife a sufficient inducement, but the Pittsburg agent had been there\r\nthe previous evening and secured her signature to the Ritchie-Hartje\r\ndeed by the promise of a silk dress! Thus a twenty-dollar gown changed\r\nthe ultimate ownership of millions of dollars! The long-haired novelist,\r\nwho soars into the infinite and dives into the unfathomable, may try to\r\nimagine what the addition of a new bonnet would have accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe seven Pittsburgers organized a stock company in 1860 to\r\ndevelop the farm. By act of Legislature this was incorporated on\r\nMay first, 1861, as the Columbia Oil-Company, with a nominal\r\ncapital of two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand dollars—ten-thousand\r\nshares of twenty-five dollars each. Twenty-one-thousand barrels of\r\noil were produced in 1861 and ninety-thousand in 1862, shares\r\nselling at two to ten dollars. Foreign demand for oil improved\r\nmatters. On July eighth, 1863, the first dividend of thirty per\r\ncent. was declared, followed in August and September by two of\r\ntwenty-five per cent. and in October by one of fifty per cent.\r\nFour dividends, aggregating one-hundred-and-sixty per cent., were\r\ndeclared the first six months of 1864. The capital was increased\r\nto two-and-a-half-millions, by calling in the old stock and giving\r\neach holder of a twenty-five-dollar share five new ones of fifty\r\ndollars apiece. Four-hundred per cent. were paid on this capital\r\nin six years. The original stockholders received their money back\r\n_forty-three_ times and had ten times their first stock to keep on\r\ndrawing fat dividends! Suppose a person had bought one-hundred\r\nshares in 1862 at two dollars, in eight years he would have been\r\npaid one-hundred-and-seven-thousand dollars for his two hundred\r\nand have five-hundred fifty-dollar shares on hand! From a mere\r\nspeck of the Story farm the Columbia Oil-Company in ten years\r\nproduced oil that sold for ten-millions of dollars! Wonder not\r\nthat men, dazzled by such returns, blind to the failures that\r\nlittered the oily domain, clutched at the veriest phantoms in the\r\nmad craze for boundless wealth.\r\n\r\nSplendidly managed throughout, the policy of the Columbia Company was to\r\noperate its lands systematically. Wells were not drilled at random over\r\nthe farm, nor were leases granted to speculators. There was no effort to\r\nmake a big showing of production and exhaust the territory in the\r\nshortest time possible. For twenty-five years the Story farm yielded\r\nprofitably. The wells, never amazingly large, held on tenaciously. The\r\nLadies’ well produced sixty-five-thousand barrels, the Floral\r\nsixty-thousand, the Big Tank fifty-thousand, the Story Centre\r\nforty-five-thousand, the Breedtown forty-thousand, the Cherry Run\r\nfifty-five-thousand, the Titus pair one-hundred-thousand and the Perry\r\nthirty-five-thousand. The company erected machine-shops, built houses\r\nfor employés, and the village of Columbia prospered. The Columbia Cornet\r\nBand, superbly appointed, its thirty members in rich uniforms, its\r\ninstruments the finest and its drum-major an acrobatic revelation, could\r\nhave given Gilmore’s or Sousa’s points in ravishing music. G. S.\r\nBancroft superintended the wells and D. H. Boulton, now of Franklin,\r\nassisted President D. B. Stewart, of Pittsburg, in conducting affairs\r\ngenerally. The village has vanished, the cornet band is hushed forever,\r\nthe fields are the prey of weeds and underbrush and brakemen no more\r\ncall out “Columby!” A few small wells, hidden amid the hills, produce a\r\nmorsel of oil, but the farm, despoiled of sixteen-million dollars of\r\ngreasy treasure, would not bring one-fourth the price paid William Story\r\nfor it in the fall of 1859. “So passes away earthly glory” is as true\r\nto-day as when Horace evolved the classic phrase two-thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n              “Man wants but little, nor that little long;\r\n              How soon must he resign his very dust,\r\n              Which frugal nature lent him for an hour!”\r\n\r\nOn the east side of Oil Creek, opposite the southern half of the Story\r\nfarm, James Tarr owned and occupied a triangular tract of two-hundred\r\nacres. He was a strong-limbed, loud-voiced, stout-hearted son of toil,\r\nfarming in summer and hauling lumber in winter to support his family.\r\nAlthough uneducated, he had plenty of “horse sense” and native wit. His\r\nquaint speech coined words and terms that are entrenched firmly in the\r\nnomenclature of Oildom. Funny stories have been told at his expense. One\r\nof these, relating to his daughter, whom he had taken to a seminary, has\r\nappeared in hundreds of newspapers. According to the revised version,\r\nthe principal of the school expressing a fear that the girl had not\r\n“capacity,” the fond father, profoundly ignorant of what was meant, drew\r\na roll of greenbacks from his pocket and exclaimed: “Damn it, that’s\r\nnothing! Buy her one and here’s the stuff to pay for it!” The fact that\r\nit is pure fiction may detract somewhat from the piquancy of this\r\nincident. Tarr realized his own deficiencies from lack of schooling and\r\nspared no pains, when the golden stream flowed his way, to educate the\r\nchildren dwelling in the old home on the south end of the farm. His\r\ndaughters were bright, good-looking, intelligent girls. Scratching the\r\nbarren hills for a meager corn-crop, hunting rabbits on Sundays, rafting\r\nin the spring and fall and teaming while snow lasted barely sufficed to\r\nkeep the gaunt wolf of hunger from the door of many a hardy Oil-Creek\r\nsettler. To their credit be it said, most of the land-owners whom\r\npetroleum enriched took care of their money. Rough diamonds, uncut and\r\nunpolished, they possessed intrinsic worth. James Tarr was of the number\r\nwho did not lose their heads and squander their substance. The richest\r\nof them all, he bought a delightful home near Meadville, provided every\r\ncomfort and convenience, spent his closing years enjoyably and died in\r\n1871. “Put yourself in his place” and, candidly, would you have done\r\nbetter?\r\n\r\nFor himself, George B. Delamater and L. L. Lamb, in the summer of 1860\r\nOrange Noble leased seven acres of the Tarr farm, at the bend in Oil\r\nCreek. Dry holes the partners “kicked down” on the Stackpole and Jones\r\nfarms dampening their ardor, they let the Tarr lease lie dormant some\r\nmonths. Contracting with a Townville neighbor—N. S. Woodford—to juggle\r\nthe “spring-pole,” he cracked the first sand in June, 1861. The Crescent\r\nwell—so called because the faith of the owners was increasing—tipped the\r\nbeam at five-hundred barrels. The first well on the Tarr farm, it flowed\r\nan average of three-hundred barrels a day for thirteen months, quitting\r\nwithout notice. Cleaning it out, drilling it deeper and pumping it for\r\nweeks were of no avail. Not a drop of oil could be extracted and the\r\nCrescent was abandoned. Crude was so low during most of its\r\nexistence—ten to twenty-five cents—that the well, although it produced\r\none-hundred-and-twenty-thousand barrels, did not pay the owners a dollar\r\nof profit! Drilling, royalty and tankage absorbed every nickel. Like the\r\nvictories of Pyrrhus, the more such strikes a fellow achieved the sooner\r\nhe would be undone!\r\n\r\nOn the evening of August first, 1861, as James Tarr sat eating his\r\nsupper of fried pork and johnny-cake, Heman Janes, of Erie, entered the\r\nroom. “Tarr,” he said, “I’ll give you sixty-thousand dollars in spot\r\ncash for your farm!” Tarr almost fell off his chair. A year before\r\none-thousand dollars would have been big money for the whole plantation.\r\n“I mean it,” continued the visitor; “if you take me up I’ll close the\r\ndeal right here!” Tarr “took him up” and the deal, which included a\r\ntransfer of several leases, was closed quickly. Janes planked down the\r\nsixty-thousand and Tarr, within an hour, had stepped from poverty to\r\naffluence. This was the first large _cash_ transaction in oil-lands on\r\nthe creek and people promptly pronounced Janes a fool of the\r\nthirty-third degree. An Irishman, on trial for stealing a sheep, asked\r\nby the judge whether he was guilty or not guilty, replied: “How can I\r\ntell till I hear the ividence?” Don’t endorse the Janes verdict “till\r\nyou hear the ividence.”\r\n\r\nA short distance below the Crescent well William Phillips, who had\r\nleased a narrow strip the entire length of the farm, was also urging a\r\n“spring-pole” actively. Born in Westmoreland county in 1824, he passed\r\nhis boyhood on a farm and earned his first money mining coal. Saving his\r\nhard-won wages, he bought the keel-boat Orphan Boy and started\r\nfreighting on the Ohio and Allegheny rivers. The business proving\r\nremunerative, he drilled salt-wells at Bull Creek and Wildcat Hollow. On\r\nhis last trip from Warren to Pittsburg, in September of 1859, he noticed\r\na scum of oil in front of Thomas Downing’s farm, where South Oil City\r\nnow stands. The story of the Drake well was in everybody’s mouth and it\r\noccurred to Phillips that he could increase his growing fortune by\r\ndrilling on the Downing land. At Pittsburg he consulted Charles\r\nLockhart, William Frew, Captain Kipp and John Vanausdall and with them\r\nformed the partnership of Phillips, Frew & Co. Returning at once, he\r\nleased from Downing, erected a pole-derrick and proceeded to bore a well\r\non the water’s edge. With no machine-shops, tools or appliances nearer\r\nthan Pittsburg, a hundred-and-thirty miles off, difficulties of all\r\nkinds retarded the work nine months. Finally the job was completed and\r\nthe Albion well, pumping forty barrels a day, raised a commotion.\r\n\r\nThe Albion brought Phillips to the front as an oil-operator. James Tarr\r\nreadily leased him part of his farm and he began Phillips No. 1 well in\r\nthe spring of 1861. The Crescent’s unexpected success spurred him to\r\ngreater efforts. Hurrying an engine and boiler from Pittsburg, he\r\nstarted his second well on the flat hugging the stream twenty rods north\r\nof the Crescent. Steam-power rushed the tools at a boom-de-ay gait. The\r\nfirst sand, from which meanwhile No. 1 was rivaling the Crescent’s\r\nyield, had not a pinch of oil. The solid-silver lining of the\r\npetroleum-cloud assumed a plated look, but Phillips heeded it not. An\r\nexpert driller, he hustled the tools and on October nineteenth, at\r\nfour-hundred-and-eighty feet, pierced the shell above the third sand. At\r\ndusk he shut down for the night. The weather was clear and the moon\r\nshone brightly. Suddenly a vivid flame illumined the sky. Reuben\r\nPainter’s well on the Blood farm, a mile southward, had caught fire and\r\nblazed furiously. The rare spectacle of a burning well attracted\r\neverybody for miles. Phillips and Janes were among those who hastened to\r\nthe fire, returning about midnight. An hour later they were summoned\r\nfrom bed by a man yelling at the Ella-Yaw pitch: “The Phillips is\r\nbu’sted and runnin’ down the creek!” People ran to the spot on the\r\ndouble-quick, past the Crescent and down the bank. Gas was settling\r\ndensely upon the flats and into the creek oil was pouring lavishly.\r\nDreading a fire, lights were extinguished on the adjoining tracts and\r\nneedful precautions taken. For three or four days the flow raged\r\nunhindered, then a lull occurred and tubing was inserted. After the\r\nseed-bag swelled, a stop-cock was placed on the tubing and thenceforth\r\nit was easy to regulate the flow. When oil was wanted the stop-cock was\r\nopened and wooden troughs conveyed the stuff to boats drawn up the creek\r\nby horses, the chief mode of transportation for years. The oil was\r\nforty-four gravity and four-thousand barrels a day gushed out! In June\r\nof 1862, when Phillips and Major Frew, with their wives and a party of\r\nfriends, inspected the well, a careful gauge showed it was doing\r\nthirty-six-hundred-and-sixty barrels! The Phillips well held the\r\nchampion-belt twenty-seven years. It produced until 1871, getting down\r\nto ten or twelve barrels and ceasing altogether the night James Tarr\r\nexpired, having yielded nearly _one-million_ barrels! Cargoes of the oil\r\nwere sold to boatmen at five cents a barrel, thousands of barrels were\r\nwasted, tens of thousands were stored in underground tanks and much was\r\nsold at three to thirteen dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOODFORD WELL.   TARR FARM IN 1862.    PHILLIPS WELL.]\r\n\r\nN. S. Woodford, Noble & Delamater’s contractor, had the foresight to\r\nlease the ground between the Crescent and the Phillips No. 2. His\r\nthree-thousand barreler, finished in December, 1861, drew its grist from\r\nthe Phillips crevice and interfered with the mammoth gusher. When the\r\ntwo became pumpers neither would give out oil unless both were worked.\r\nIf one was stopped the other pumped water. Ultimately the Phillips crowd\r\npaid Woodford a half-million for his well and lease, a wad for which a\r\nman would ford even the atrocious Tarr-farm mud and complacently whistle\r\n“Ta-ra-ra.” He retired to his pleasant home, with six-hundred-thousand\r\ndollars to show for eighteen months’ operations on Oil Creek, and never\r\nbothered any more about oil. The Woodford well repaid its enormous cost.\r\nLockhart and Frew bought out their partners at a high price and put the\r\nPhillips-Woodford interests into a stock-company capitalized at\r\ntwo-million dollars. The Phillips well—one result of a keen-eyed\r\nboatman’s observing an oily scum on the Allegheny River—enriched all\r\nconcerned. Had Phillips failed to see the speck of grease that September\r\nday, who can tell how different oil-region history might have been?\r\nHappily for a good many persons, the Orphan Boy was not one of the\r\n“Ships that Pass in the Night.” What a field Oil Creek presents for the\r\nfervid fancy of a Dumas, a Dickens, a Wilkie Collins or a Charles Reade!\r\n\r\nComrades in business and good-fellowship, William Phillips and John\r\nVanausdall removed to South Oil-City, lived neighbors and died twenty\r\nyears ago. They resembled each other in appearance and temper, in\r\ncharitable impulse and kindness to the poor. Phillips drilled dozens of\r\nwells—none of them dry—aided Oil-City enterprises and was a member of\r\nthe shipping firm of Munhall & Co. until its dissolution in 1876. He was\r\nthe first man to ship oil by steamer, the Venango taking the first load\r\nto Pittsburg, and the first to run crude in bulk down the creek. One\r\nson, John C. Phillips, and a married daughter live at Oil City and two\r\nsons at Freeport.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEMAN JANES.]\r\n\r\nHeman Janes, of Erie, the first purchaser of the Tarr farm, from 1850 to\r\n1861 shipped large quantities of lumber to the eastern market. Passing\r\nthrough Canada in 1858, he heard oil was obtained from gum-beds in\r\nLambton county, south of Lake Huron, and visited the place. John\r\nWilliams was dipping five barrels a day from a hole ten feet square and\r\ntwenty feet deep. The best gum-beds spread over two-hundred acres of\r\ntimbered land, which Mr. Janes bought at nine dollars an acre, the owner\r\nselling because “the stinking oil smelled five miles off.” Leasing\r\nfour-hundred acres more, in 1860 he sold a half-interest in both tracts\r\nfor fifteen-thousand dollars and retired from lumbering to devote his\r\nattention to oil. Large wells on his Canadian lands enabled him to sell\r\nthe second half of the property in 1865 for fifty-five-thousand dollars.\r\nIn February, 1861, he secured a thirty-day option on the J. Buchanan\r\nfarm, the site of Rouseville, and tendered the price at the stipulated\r\ntime, but the transaction fell through. In March of that year he went to\r\nWest Virginia and leased one-thousand acres on the Kanawha River,\r\nincluding the famous “Burning Spring.” U. E. Everett & Co. agreed to pay\r\nfifty-thousand dollars for one-half interest in the property, at\r\nParkersburg, on April twelfth. All parties met, a certified check was\r\nlaid on the table and Attorney J. B. Blair started to draw the papers.\r\nAt that moment a boy ran past, shouting: “Fort Sumpter’s fired on!” The\r\ngentlemen hurried out to learn the particulars. “The cat came back,” but\r\nEverett didn’t. A message told him to “hold off,” and he is holding off\r\nstill. Janes stayed as long as a Northerner dared and was thankful to\r\nsell the batch of leases for seventy-five-hundred dollars. In 1862 he\r\nsued the owners of the Phillips well for his royalty _in barrels_. They\r\nrefused to furnish the barrels, which were scarce and expensive, and the\r\nwell was shut down for months pending the litigation. The suit was for\r\none-hundred-and-twelve-thousand dollars, up to that time the largest\r\namount ever involved in a case before the Venango court. Edwin M.\r\nStanton, soon to be known as the illustrious War-Secretary, was one\r\nof the attorneys engaged by the plaintiff, for a fee of\r\ntwenty-five-thousand dollars. A compromise was arranged for half the\r\noil. The first oil sold after this agreement was at three dollars a\r\nbarrel, taken from the first twelve-hundred-barrel tank ever seen in the\r\nregion. A wooden tank of that size excited more curiosity in those days\r\nthan a hundred iron-ones of forty-thousand barrels in this year of\r\ngrace. Janes sold back half the farm to Tarr for forty-thousand dollars\r\nand two-thirds of the remaining half to Clark & Sumner for\r\ntwenty-thousand, leaving him one-sixth clear of cost, the same month he\r\nbought the tract. He first suggested casing wells to exclude the water,\r\nbuilt the first bulk-boat decked over—six-hundred barrels—to transport\r\noil and was identified with the first practicable pipe-line. Paying\r\nseventy-five-thousand dollars for the Blackmar farm, at Pithole, he\r\ndrilled three dry holes and then got rid of the land at a snug advance.\r\nSince 1878 Mr. Janes has been interested in the Bradford field and\r\nliving at Erie. A man of forceful character and executive ability,\r\nhearty, vigorous and companionable, he deserves the large measure of\r\nsuccess that rewarded him as an important factor in petroleum-affairs.\r\nIn the words of the good Scottish mother to her son: “May your lot be\r\nwi’ the rich in this warld and wi’ the puir in the warld to come.”\r\n\r\nThe amazing output of the Phillips and Woodford wells stimulated the\r\ndemand for territory to the boiling point. Men were infinitely less\r\neager to “read their title clear to mansions in the skies” than to\r\nsecure a title to a fragment of the Tarr farm. Rigs huddled on the bank\r\nand in the water, for nobody thought oil existed back in the hilly\r\nsections. Sixty yards below the Phillips spouter J. F. Crane sank a well\r\nthat responded as pleasantly as “the swinging of the crane.” Densmore\r\nBrothers, at the lower end of the farm, drilled a seven-hundred-barreler\r\nlate in 1861. A zoological freak introduced the animal-fad, which named\r\nthe Elephant, Young Elephant, Tigress, Tiger, Lioness, Scared Cat,\r\nAnaconda and Weasel wells. Reckless speculation held the fort unchecked.\r\nThe third sand was sixty feet thick, the territory was durable and\r\nthree-hundred walking-beams exhibited “the poetry of motion” to the\r\nmusic of three-four-five-six-eight-ten-dollar oil. Mr. Janes built a\r\ncommodious hotel and a town of two-thousand population flourished. James\r\nTarr sold his entire interest in 1865, for gold equivalent to\r\ntwo-millions in currency, and removed to Crawford county. Another\r\nmillion would hardly cover his royalties. Three-million dollars ahead of\r\nthe game in four years, he could afford to smile at the jibes of\r\nsmall-souled retailers of witless ridicule. If “money talks,”\r\nthree-millions ought to be pretty eloquent. The churches, stores,\r\nhouses, offices, wells and tanks have “gone glimmering.” Tarr-Farm\r\nstation appears no more on railroad time-tables. Modern maps do not\r\nreveal it. Few know and fewer care who owns the place once the apple of\r\nthe oilman’s eye, now a shadowy relic not worth carting off in a\r\nwheelbarrow!\r\n\r\nProducers have enjoyed quite a reputation for “resolving,” and the first\r\nmeeting ever held to regulate the price of crude was at Tarr farm in\r\n1861. The moving spirits were Mr. Janes, General James Wadsworth and\r\nJosiah Oakes, the latter a New-York capitalist. The idea was to raise\r\nfive-hundred-thousand dollars and buy up the territory for ten miles\r\nalong Oil Creek. Wadsworth and Oakes raised over three-hundred-thousand\r\ndollars for this purpose, when the panic arising from the war ended the\r\nscheme. A contract was also made with Erie parties to lay a four-inch\r\nwooden pipe-line from Tarr farm to Oil City. On the advice of Col.\r\nClark, of Clark & Sumner, and Sir John Hope, the eminent London banker,\r\nit was decided to abandon the project and apply for a charter for a\r\npipe-line. This was done in the winter of 1861-2, Hon. Morrow B. Lowry,\r\nwho represented the district in the State Senate, favoring the\r\napplication. Hon. M. C. Beebe, the local member of the Legislature,\r\nopposed it resolutely, because, to quote his own words: “There are\r\nfour-thousand teams hauling oil and my constituents won’t stand this\r\ninterference.” The measure failing to carry, Clark & Hope built the\r\nStandard refinery at Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nResistance to the South-Improvement-Company welded the producers solidly\r\nin 1872. The refiners organized to force a larger margin between crude\r\nand refined. To offset this and govern the production and sale of crude,\r\nthe producers established a “union,” “agencies” and “councils.” In\r\nOctober of 1872 every well in the region was shut down for thirty days.\r\nThe “spirit of seventy-six” was abroad and individual losses were borne\r\ncheerfully for the general good. This was the heroic period, which\r\ndemonstrated the manly fiber of the great body of oil-operators. E. E.\r\nClapp, of President, and Captain William Harson, of Oil City, were the\r\nchief officers of these remarkable organizations. Suspensions of\r\ndrilling in 1873-4-5 supplemented the memorable “thirty-day shut-down.”\r\nAt length the “union,” the “councils” and the “agencies” wilted and\r\ndissolved. The area of productive territory widened and strong companies\r\nbecame a necessity to develop it. The big fish swallowed the little\r\nones, hence the _personal_ feature so pronounced in earlier years has\r\nbeen almost eliminated. Many of the operators are members of the\r\nProducers’ Association, in which Congressman Phillips, Lewis Emery,\r\nDavid Kirk and T. J. Vandergrift are prime factors. Its president, Hon.\r\nJ. W. Lee, practiced law at Franklin, served twice as State-Senator and\r\nlocated at Pittsburg last year. He is a cogent speaker, not averse to\r\nlegal tilts and not backward flying his colors in the face of the enemy.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Story and Tarr farms, on both sides of Oil Creek, were John\r\nBlood’s four-hundred-and-forty acres. The owner lived in an unpainted,\r\nweatherbeaten frame house. On five acres of the flats the Ocean\r\nPetroleum-Company had twelve flowing wells in 1861. The Maple-Tree\r\nCompany’s burning well spouted twenty-five-hundred barrels for several\r\nmonths, declined to three-hundred in a year and was destroyed by fire in\r\nOctober of 1862. The flames devastated twenty acres, consuming ten wells\r\nand a hundred tanks of oil, the loss aggregating a million dollars. A\r\nsheet of fire, terribly grand and up to that date the most extensive and\r\ndestructive in Oildom, wrapped the flats and the stream. Blood Well No.\r\n1, flowing a thousand barrels, Blood No. 2, flowing six hundred, and\r\nfive other gushers never yielded after the conflagration, prior to which\r\nthe farm was producing more oil than the balance of the region. Brewer &\r\nWatson, Ballard & Trax, Edward Filkins, Henry Collins, Reuben Painter,\r\nJames Burrows and J. H. Duncan were pioneer operators on the tract.\r\nBlood sold in 1863 for five-hundred-and-sixty-thousand dollars and\r\nremoved to New York. Buying a brownstone residence on Fifth avenue, he\r\nsplurged around Gotham two or three years, quit the city for the country\r\nand died long since. The Blood farm was notably prolific, but its glory\r\nhas departed. Stripped bare of derricks, houses, wells and tanks, naught\r\nis left save the rugged hills and sandy banks. “It is no matter, the cat\r\nwill mew, the dog will have his day.”\r\n\r\nNeighbors of John Blood, a raw-boned native and his wife, enjoyed an\r\nexperience not yet forgotten in New York. Selling their farm for big\r\nmoney, the couple concluded to see Manhattanville and set off in high\r\nglee, arrayed in homespun-clothes of most agonizing country-fashion.\r\nWags on the farm advised them to go to the Astor House and insist upon\r\nhaving the finest room in the caravansary. Arriving in New York, they\r\nwere driven to the hotel, each carrying a bundle done up in a colored\r\nhandkerchief. Their rustic appearance attracted great attention, which\r\nwas increased when the man marched to the office-counter and demanded\r\n“the best in the shebang, b’gosh.” The astounded clerk tried to get the\r\nunwelcome guest to go elsewhere, assuring him he must have made a\r\nmistake. The rural delegate did not propose to be bluffed by coaxing or\r\nthreats. At length the representative of petroleum wanted to know “how\r\nmuch it would cost to buy the gol-darned ranche.” In despair the clerk\r\nsummoned the proprietor, who soon took in the situation. To humor the\r\nstranger he replied that one-hundred-thousand dollars would buy the\r\nplace. The chap produced a pile of bills and tendered him the money on\r\nthe spot! Explanations followed, a parlor and bedroom were assigned the\r\npair and for days they were the lions of the metropolis. Hundreds of\r\ncitizens and ladies called to see the innocents who had come on their\r\n“first tower” as green and unsophisticated as did Josiah Allen’s Wife\r\ntwenty years later.\r\n\r\nAmbrose Rynd, an Irish woolen-factor, bought five-hundred acres from the\r\nHolland Land-Company in 1800 and built a log-cabin at the mouth of\r\nCherrytree Run. He attained the Nestorian age of ninety-nine. His\r\ngrandson, John Rynd, born in the log-cabin in 1815, owned three-hundred\r\nacres of the tract when the petroleum-wave swept Oil Creek. The Blood\r\nfarm was north and the Smith east. Cherrytree and Wykle Runs rippled\r\nthrough the western half of the property, which Oil Creek divided\r\nnicely. Developments in 1861 were on the eastern half. Starting at\r\nfive-hundred barrels, the Rynd well flowed until 1863. The Crawford\r\n“saw” the Rynd and “went it one better,” lasting until June of 1864. Six\r\nfair wells were drilled on Rynd Island, a dot at the upper part of the\r\nfarm. The Rynd-Farm Oil-Company of New York purchased the tract in 1864.\r\nJohn Rynd moved to Fayette county and died in the seventies. Hume &\r\nCrawford, Porter & Milroy, B. F. Wren, the Ozark, Favorite, Frost,\r\nNorthern and a score of companies operated vigorously. The third sand\r\nthickened and improved with the elevation of the hills. Five refineries\r\nhandled a thousand barrels of crude per week. A snug village bloomed on\r\nthe west side, the broad flat affording an eligible site. The late John\r\nWallace and Theodore Ladd were prominent in the later stage of\r\noperations. Cyrus D. Rynd returned in 1881 to take charge of the farm\r\nand served as postmaster six years. Rynd, once plump and juicy, now lean\r\nand desiccated, resembles an orange which a boy has sucked and thrown\r\naway the rind.\r\n\r\nTwo museum-curio wells on the Rynd farm illustrated practically Chaplain\r\nMcCabe’s “Drinking From the Same Canteen.” A dozen strokes of the pump\r\nevery hour caused the Agitator to flow ten or fifteen minutes. The pious\r\nSunday well, its companion, loafed six days in the week while the other\r\nworked, flowing on the Sabbath when the Agitator pump rested from its\r\nlabors. This sort of affinity, which cost William Phillips and Noble &\r\nDelamater a mint of money, was evinced most forcibly on the McClintock\r\nfarm, west side of Oil Creek, south of Rynd. William McClintock,\r\noriginal owner of the two-hundred acres, dying in 1859, the widow\r\nremained on the farm with her grandson, John W. Steele, whom the couple\r\nhad adopted at a tender age, upon the decease of his mother. Nearly half\r\nthe farm was bottom-land, fronting the creek, on the bank of which the\r\nfirst wells were sunk in 1861. The Vanslyke flowed twelve-hundred\r\nbarrels a day, declined slowly and in its third year pumped\r\nfourteen-thousand. The Lloyd, Eastman, Little Giant, Morrison, Hayes &\r\nMerrick, Christy, Ocean, Painter, Sterrett, Chase and sixty more each\r\nput up fifty to four-hundred barrels daily. Directly between the\r\nVanslyke and Christy, a few rods from either, New-York parties finished\r\nthe Hammond well in May, 1864. Starting to flow three-hundred barrels a\r\nday, the Hammond killed the Lloyd and Christy and reduced the Vanslyke\r\nto a ten-barrel pumper. Its triumph was short-lived. Early in June the\r\nNew Yorkers, elated over its performance, bought the royalty of the well\r\nand one-third acre of ground for two-hundred thousand dollars. The end\r\nof June the tubing was drawn from the Excelsior well, on the John\r\nMcClintock farm, five-hundred yards east, flooding the Hammond and all\r\nthe wells in the vicinity. The damage was attributed to Vandergrift &\r\nTitus’s new well a short distance down the flat, nobody imagining it\r\ncame from a hole a quarter-mile off. Retubing the Excelsior quickly\r\nrestored one-half the Hammond’s yield, which increased as the\r\nExcelsior’s lessened. An adjustment followed, but the final pulling of\r\nthe tubing from the Excelsior drowned the affected wells permanently.\r\nGeologists and scientists reveled in the ethics suggested by such\r\ninterference, which casing wells has obviated. The Widow-McClintock farm\r\nproduced hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil and changed hands\r\nrepeatedly. For years it was owned by a man who as a boy blacked\r\nSteele’s boots. In 1892 John Waites renovated a number of the old wells.\r\nPumping some and plugging others, to shut out water, surprised and\r\nrewarded him with a yield that is bringing him a tidy fortune. The\r\naction of the stream has washed away the ground on which the Vanslyke,\r\nthe Sterrett and several of the largest wells were located. “Out, out,\r\nbrief candle!”\r\n\r\nMrs. McClintock, like thousands of women since, attempted one day in\r\nMarch of 1863 to hurry up the kitchen-fire with kerosene. The result was\r\nher fatal burning, death in an hour and the first funeral to the account\r\nof the treacherous oil-can. The poor woman wore coarse clothing, worked\r\nhard and secreted her wealth about the house. Her will, written soon\r\nafter McClintock’s exit, bequeathed everything to the adopted heir, John\r\nW. Steele, twenty years old when his grandmother met her tragic fate. At\r\neighteen he had married Miss M. Moffett, daughter of a farmer in\r\nSugarcreek township. He hauled oil in 1861 with hired plugs until he\r\ncould buy a span of stout horses. Oil-Creek teamsters, proficient in\r\nlurid profanity, coveted his varied stock of pointed expletives. The\r\nblonde driver, of average height and slender build, pleasing in\r\nappearance and address, by no means the unlicked cub and ignorant boor\r\nhe has been represented, neither smoke nor drank nor gambled, but “he\r\ncould say ‘damn’!” Climbing a hill with a load of oil, the end-board\r\ndropped out and five barrels of crude wabbled over the steep bank. It\r\nwas exasperating and the spectators expected a special outburst. Steele\r\n“winked the other eye” and remarked placidly: “Boys, it’s no use trying\r\nto do justice to this occasion.” The shy youth, living frugally and not\r\nthe type people would associate with unprecedented antics, was to figure\r\nin song and story and be advertised more widely than the sea-serpent or\r\nBarnum’s woolly-horse. Millions who never heard of John Smith, Dr. Mary\r\nWalker or Baby McKee have heard and read and talked about the\r\none-and-only “Coal-Oil Johnnie.”\r\n\r\nThe future candidate for minstrel-gags and newspaper-space was hauling\r\noil when a neighbor ran to tell him of Mrs. McClintock’s death. He\r\nhastened home. A search of the premises disclosed two-hundred-thousand\r\ndollars the old lady had hoarded. Wm. Blackstone, appointed his\r\nguardian, restricted the minor to a reasonable allowance. The young\r\nman’s conduct was irreproachable until he attained his majority. His\r\nincome was enormous. Mr. Blackstone paid him three-hundred-thousand\r\ndollars in a lump and he resolved to “see some of the world.” He saw it,\r\nnot through smoked glass either. His escapades supplied no end of\r\nmaterial for gossip. Many tales concerning him were exaggerations and\r\nmany pure inventions. Demure, slow-going Philadelphia he colored a\r\nflaming vermilion. He gave away carriages after a single drive, kept\r\nopen-house in a big hotel and squandered thousands of dollars a day.\r\nSeth Slocum was “showing him the sights” and he fell an easy victim to\r\nblacklegs and swindlers. He ordered champagne by the dozen baskets and\r\ntreated theatrical companies to the costliest wine-suppers. Gay ballet\r\ngirls at Fox’s old play-house told spicy stories of these midnight\r\nfrolics. To a negro-comedian, who sang a song that pleased him, he\r\nhanded a thousand-dollar pin. He would walk the streets with bank-bills\r\nstuck in the buttonholes of his coat for Young America to grab. He\r\ncourted club-men and spent cash like the Count of Monte Cristo. John\r\nMorrissey sat a night with him at cards in his Saratoga gambling-house,\r\ncleaning him out of many thousands. Leeches bled him and sharpers\r\nfleeced him mercilessly. He was a spendthrift, but he didn’t light\r\ncigars with hundred-dollar bills, buy a Philadelphia hotel to give a\r\nchum nor destroy money “for fun.” Usually somebody benefited by his\r\nextravagances.\r\n\r\nOccasionally his prodigality assumed a sensible phase.\r\nTwenty-eight-hundred dollars, one day’s receipts from his wells and\r\nroyalty, went toward the erection of the soldiers’ monument—a\r\nmagnificent shaft of white marble—in the Franklin park. Except Dan\r\nRice’s five-thousand memorial at Girard, Erie county, this was the first\r\nmonument in the Union to the fallen heroes of the civil war. Ten, twenty\r\nor fifty dollars frequently gladdened the poor who asked for relief. He\r\nlavished fine clothes and diamonds on a minstrel-troupe, touring the\r\ncountry and entertaining crowds in the oil-regions. John W. Gaylord, an\r\nartist in burnt-cork and member of the troupe, has furnished these\r\ndetails:\r\n\r\n“Yes. ‘Coal-Oil Johnnie’ was my particular friend in his palmiest days.\r\nI was his room-mate when he cut the shines that celebrated him as the\r\nmost eccentric millionaire on earth. I was with the Skiff & Gaylord\r\nminstrels. Johnnie saw us perform in Philadelphia, got stuck on the\r\nbusiness and bought one-third interest in the show. His first move was\r\nto get five-thousand dollars’ worth of woodcuts at his own expense. They\r\nwere all the way from a one-sheet to a twenty-four-sheet in size and the\r\nlargest amount any concern had ever owned. The cartoon, which attracted\r\nso much attention, of ‘Bring That Skiff Over Here,’ was in the lot. We\r\nwent on the road, did a monstrous business everywhere, turned people\r\naway and were prosperous.\r\n\r\n“Reaching Utica, N. Y., Johnnie treated to a supper for the company,\r\nwhich cost one-thousand dollars. He then conceived the idea of traveling\r\nby his own train and purchased an engine, a sleeper and a baggage-car.\r\nDates for two weeks were cancelled and we went junketing, Johnnie\r\nfooting the bills. At Erie we had a five-hundred-dollar supper; and so\r\nit went. It was here that Johnnie bought his first hack. After a short\r\nride he presented it to the driver. Our dates being cancelled, Johnnie\r\ninsisted upon indemnifying us for the loss of time. He paid all\r\nsalaries, estimated the probable business receipts upon the basis of\r\npacked houses and paid that also to our treasurer.\r\n\r\n“In Chicago he gave another exhibition of his eccentric traits. He\r\nleased the Academy of Music for the season and we did a big business.\r\nFinally he proposed a benefit for Skiff & Gaylord and sent over to rent\r\nthe Crosby Opera-House, then the finest in the country. The manager sent\r\nback the insolent reply: ‘We won’t rent our house for an infernal\r\nnigger-show.’ Johnnie got warm in the collar. He went down to their\r\noffice in Root & Cady’s music-store.\r\n\r\n“‘What will you take for your house and sell it outright?’ he asked Mr.\r\nRoot.\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t want to sell.’\r\n\r\n“‘I’ll give you a liberal price. Money is no object.’\r\n\r\n“Then Johnnie pulled out a roll from his valise, counted out\r\ntwo-hundred-thousand dollars and asked Root if that was an object. Mr.\r\nRoot was thunderstruck. ‘If you are that kind of a man you can have the\r\nhouse for the benefit free of charge.’ The benefit was the biggest\r\nsuccess ever known in minstrelsy. The receipts were forty-five-hundred\r\ndollars and more were turned away than could be given admission. Next\r\nday Johnnie hunted up one of the finest carriage-horses in the city and\r\npresented it to Mr. Root for the courtesy extended.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Johnnie was a prince with his money. I have seen him spend as high\r\nas one hundred-thousand dollars in one day. That was the time he hired\r\nthe Continental Hotel in Philadelphia and wanted to buy the Girard\r\nHouse. He went to the Continental and politely said to the clerk: ‘Will\r\nyou please tell the proprietor that J. W. Steele wishes to see him?’\r\n‘No, sir,’ said the clerk; ‘the landlord is busy.’ Johnnie suggested he\r\ncould make it pay the clerk to accommodate the whim. The clerk became\r\ndisdainful and Johnnie tossed a bell-boy a twenty-dollar gold-piece with\r\nthe request. The result was an interview with the landlord. Johnnie\r\nclaimed he had been ill-treated and requested the summary dismissal of\r\nthe clerk. The proprietor refused and Johnnie offered to buy the hotel.\r\nThe man said he could not sell, because he was not the entire owner. A\r\nbargain was made to lease it one day for eight-thousand dollars. The\r\ncash was paid over and Johnnie installed as landlord. He made me\r\nbell-boy, while Slocum officiated as clerk. The doors were thrown open\r\nand every guest in the house had his fill of wine and edibles free of\r\ncost. A huge placard was posted in front of the hotel: ‘Open house\r\nto-day; everything free; all are welcome!’ It was a merry lark. The\r\nwhole city seemed to catch on and the house was full. When Johnnie\r\nthought he had had fun enough he turned the hostelry over to the\r\nlandlord, who reinstated the odious clerk. Here was a howdedo. Johnnie\r\nwas frantic with rage. He went over to the Girard and tried to buy it.\r\nHe arranged with the proprietor to ‘buck’ the Continental by making the\r\nprices so low that everybody would come there. The Continental did\r\nmighty little business so long as the arrangement lasted.\r\n\r\n“The day of the hotel-transaction we were up on Arch street. A rain\r\nsetting in, Johnnie approached a hack in front of a fashionable store\r\nand tried to engage it to carry us up to the Girard. The driver said it\r\nwas impossible, as he had a party in the store. Johnnie tossed him a\r\nfive-hundred-dollar bill and the hackman said he would risk it. When we\r\narrived at the hotel Johnnie said: ‘See here, Cabby, you’re a likely\r\nfellow. How would you like to own that rig?’ The driver thought he was\r\njoking, but Johnnie handed him two-thousand dollars. A half-hour later\r\nthe delighted driver returned with the statement that the purchase had\r\nbeen effected. Johnnie gave him a thousand more to buy a stable and that\r\nman to-day is the wealthiest hack-owner in Philadelphia.”\r\n\r\nSteele reached the end of his string and the farm was sold in 1866. When\r\nhe was flying the highest Captain J. J. Vandergrift and T. H. Williams\r\nkindly urged him to save some of his money. He thanked them for the\r\nfriendly advice, said he had made a living by hauling oil and could do\r\nso again if necessary, but he couldn’t rest until he had spent that\r\nfortune. He spent a million and got the “rest.” Returning to Oildom\r\n“dead broke,” he secured the position of baggage-master at Rouseville\r\nstation. He attended to his duties punctually, was a model of domestic\r\nvirtue and a most popular, obliging official. Happily his wife had saved\r\nsomething and the reunited couple got along swimmingly. Next he opened a\r\nmeat-market at Franklin, built up a nice business, sold the shop and\r\nmoved to Ashland, Nebraska. He farmed, laid up money and entered the\r\nservice of the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad some years ago as\r\nbaggage-master. His manly son, whom he educated splendidly, is\r\ntelegraph-operator at Ashland station. The father, “steady as a clock,”\r\nis industrious, reliable and deservedly esteemed. Recently a fresh crop\r\nof stories regarding him has been circulated, but he minds his own\r\naffairs and is not one whit puffed up that the latest rival of Pears and\r\nBabbitt has just brought out a brand of “Coal-Oil Johnnie Soap.”\r\n\r\nJohn McClintock’s farm of two-hundred acres, east of Steele and south of\r\nRynd, Chase & Alden leased in September of 1859, for one-half the oil.\r\nB. R. Alden was a naval officer, disabled from wounds received in\r\nCalifornia, and an oil-seeker at Cuba, New York. A hundred wells\r\nrendered the farm extremely productive. The Anderson, sunk in 1861 near\r\nthe southeast corner, on Cherry Run, flowed constantly three years,\r\nwaning gradually from two-hundred barrels to twenty. Efforts to stop the\r\nflow in 1862, when oil dropped to ten or fifteen cents, merely imbued it\r\nwith fresh vigor. Anderson thought the oil-business had gone to the\r\nbow-wows and deemed himself lucky to get seven-thousand dollars in the\r\nfall for the well. It earned one-hundred-thousand dollars subsequently\r\nand then sold for sixty-thousand. The Excelsior produced fifty-thousand\r\nbarrels before the interference with the Hammond destroyed both. The\r\nWheeler, Wright & Hall, Alice Lee, Jew, Deming, Haines and Taft wells\r\nwere choice specimens. William and Robert Orr’s Auburn Oil-Works and the\r\nPennechuck Refinery chucked six-hundred barrels a week into the stills.\r\nThe McClintocks have migrated from Venango. Some are in heaven, some in\r\nCrawford county and some in the west. If Joseph Cooke’s conundrum—“Does\r\nDeath End All?”—be negatived, there ought to be a grand reunion when\r\nthey meet in the New Jerusalem and talk over their experiences on Oil\r\nCreek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL Q. BROWN, FOSTER W. MITCHELL, JOHN L. MITCHELL]\r\n\r\n                                             SAMUEL Q. BROWN\r\n                           FOSTER W. MITCHELL\r\n           JOHN L. MITCHELL\r\n\r\nEight miles east of Titusville, at Enterprise, John L. and Foster W.\r\nMitchell, sons of a pioneer settler of Allegheny township, were\r\nlumbering and merchandising in 1859. They had worked on the farm and\r\nlearned blacksmithing from their father. The report of Col. Drake’s\r\nwell stirred the little hamlet. John L. Mitchell mounted a horse and\r\nrode at a John-Gilpin gallop to lease Archibald Buchanan’s big farm,\r\non both sides of Oil Creek and Cherry Run. The old man agreed to his\r\nterms, a lease was executed, the rosy-cheeked mistress and all the\r\npupils in the log school-house who could write witnessed the\r\nsignatures and Mitchell rode back with the document in his pocket. He\r\nalso leased John Buchanan’s two hundred acres, south of Archibald\r\nBuchanan’s three-hundred on the same terms—one-fourth the oil for\r\nninety years. Forming a partnership with Henry R. Rouse and Samuel Q.\r\nBrown, he “kicked down” the first well in 1860 to the first sand. It\r\npumped ten barrels a day and was bought by A. Potter, who sank it and\r\nanother to the third sand in 1861. A three-hundred-barreler for\r\nmonths, No. 1 changed hands four times, was bought in 1865 by Gould &\r\nStowell and produced oil—it pumped for fifteen years—that sold for\r\ntwo-hundred-and-ninety-thousand dollars! This veteran was the third or\r\nfourth producing well in the region. The Curtis, usually considered\r\n“the first flowing-well,” in July of 1860 spouted freely at\r\ntwo-hundred feet. It was not tubed and surface-water soon mastered the\r\nflow of oil. The Brawley—sixty-thousand barrels in eight months—Goble\r\n& Flower, Shaft and Sherman were moguls of 1861-2. Beech & Gillett,\r\nAlfred Willoughby, Taylor & Rockwell, Shreve & Glass, Allen Wright,\r\nWesley Chambers—his infectious laugh could be heard five squares—and a\r\nhost of companies operated in 1861-2-3. Franklin S. Tarbell, E. M.\r\nHukell, E. C. Bradley, Harmon Camp, George Long and J. T. Jones\r\narrived later. The territory was singularly profitable. Mitchell &\r\nBrown erected a refinery, divided the tracts into hundreds of\r\nacre-plots for leases and laid out the town of Buchanan Farm. Allen\r\nWright, president of a local oil-company, in February of 1861 printed\r\nhis letter-heads “Rouseville” and the name was adopted unanimously.\r\n\r\nRouseville grew swiftly and for a time was headquarters of the oil\r\nindustry. Churches and schools arose, good people feeling that man lives\r\nnot by oil alone any more than by bread. Dwellings extended up Cherry\r\nRun and the slopes of Mt. Pisgah. Wells and tanks covered the flats and\r\nthere were few drones in the busy hive. If Satan found mischief for the\r\nidle only, he would have starved in Rouseville. Stores and shops\r\nmultiplied. James White fitted up an opera-house and C. L. Stowell\r\nopened a bank. Henry Patchen conducted the first hotel. N. W. Read\r\nenacted the role of “Petroleum V. Nasby, wich iz postmaster.” The\r\nreceipts in 1869 exceeded twenty-five-thousand dollars. Miss Nettie\r\nDickinson, afterwards in full charge of the money-order department at\r\nPittsburg and partner with Miss Annie Burke in a flourishing Oil-City\r\nbookstore, ran the office in an efficient style Postmaster-General\r\nWilson would have applauded. Yet moss-backed croakers in pants, left\r\nover from the Pliocene period, think the gentle sex has no business with\r\nbusiness! The town reached high-water mark early in the seventies, the\r\npopulation grazing nine-thousand. Production declined, new fields\r\nattracted live operators and in 1880 the inhabitants numbered\r\nseven-hundred, twice the present figure. Rouseville will go down in\r\nhistory as an oil-town noted for progressiveness, intelligence, crooked\r\nstreets and girls “pretty as a picture.”\r\n\r\n             You could always count on a lively rustle—\r\n             The boys knew how to get up and hustle,\r\n             And of course the girls had plenty of bustle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESLEY CHAMBERS.]\r\n\r\nThe Buchanan-Farm Oil-Company purchased Mitchell & Brown’s interest and\r\nthe Buchanan Royalty Oil-Company acquired the one-fourth held by the\r\nland-owners. Both realized heavily, the Royalty Company paying its\r\nstock-holders—Arnold Plumer, William Haldeman and Dr. C. E. Cooper were\r\nprincipals—about a million dollars. The senior Buchanan, after receiving\r\ntwo or three-hundred-thousand dollars—fifty times the sum he would ever\r\nhave gained farming—often denounced “th’ pirates that robbed an old man,\r\nbuyin’ th’ farm he could ’ave sold two year later fur two millyun!” The\r\nold man has been out of pirate range twenty-five years and the Buchanan\r\nfamilies are scattered. Most of the old-time operators have handed in\r\ntheir final account. Poor Fred Rockwell has mouldered into dust. Wright,\r\nCamp, Taylor, Beech, Long, Shreve, Haldeman, Hostetter, Cooper, Col.\r\nGibson and Frank Irwin are “grav’d in the hollow ground.” Death claimed\r\n“Hi” Whiting in Florida and last March stilled the cheery voice of\r\nWesley Chambers. The earnest, pleading tones of the Rev. R. M. Brown\r\nwill be heard no more this side the walls of jasper and the gates of\r\npearl. Scores moved to different parts of the country. John L. Mitchell\r\nmarried Miss Hattie A. Raymond and settled at Franklyn. He organized the\r\nExchange Bank in 1871 and was its president until ill-health obliged him\r\nto resign. Foster W. Mitchell also located at the county-seat and built\r\nthe Exchange Hotel. He operated extensively on Oil Creek and in the\r\nnorthern districts, developed the Shaw Farm and established a bank at\r\nRouseville, subsequently transferring it to Oil City. He was active in\r\npolitics and in the producers’ organizations, treasurer of the\r\nCentennial Commission and an influential force in the Oil-Exchange.\r\nDavid H. Mitchell likewise gained a fortune in oil, founded a bank and\r\ndied at Titusville. Samuel Q. Brown, their relative and associate in\r\nvarious undertakings, was a merchant and banker at Pleasantville.\r\nRetiring from these pursuits, he removed to Philadelphia and then to New\r\nYork to oversee the financial work of the Tidewater Pipe-Line. He\r\nprocured the charter for the first pipe-line and acquired a fortune by\r\nhis business-talent and wise management.\r\n\r\n             “Let Hercules himself do what he may,\r\n             The cat will mew, the dog will have his day.”\r\n\r\nBorn in New York in 1824, Henry R. Rouse studied law, taught school in\r\nWarren county and engaged in lumbering and storekeeping at Enterprise.\r\nHe served in the legislatures of 1859-60, acquitting himself manfully.\r\nPromptly catching the inspiration of the hour, he shared with William\r\nBarnsdall and Boone Meade the honor of putting down the third oil-well\r\nin Pennsylvania. With John L. Mitchell and Samuel Q. Brown he leased the\r\nBuchanan farm and invested in oil-lands generally. Fabulous wealth began\r\nto reward his efforts. Had he lived “he would have been a giant or a\r\nbankrupt in petroleum.” Operations on the John Buchanan farm were pushed\r\nactively. Near the upper line of the farm, on the east side of Oil\r\nCreek, at the foot of the hill, Merrick & Co. drilled a well in 1861,\r\neight rods from the Wadsworth. On April seventeenth, at the depth of\r\nthree-hundred feet, gas, water and oil rushed up, fairly lifting the\r\ntools out of the hole. The evening was damp and the atmosphere\r\nsurcharged with gas. People ran with shovels to dig trenches and throw\r\nup a bank to hold the oil, no tanks having been provided. Mr. Rouse and\r\nGeorge H. Dimick, his clerk and cashier, with six others, had eaten\r\nsupper and were sitting in Anthony’s Hotel discussing the fall of Fort\r\nSumter. A laborer at the Merrick well bounded into the room to say that\r\na vein of oil had been struck and barrels were wanted. All ran to the\r\nwell but Dimick, who went to send barrels. Finishing this errand, he\r\nhastened towards the well. A frightful explosion hurled him to the\r\nearth. Smouldering coals under the Wadsworth boiler had ignited the gas.\r\nIn an instant the two wells, tanks and an acre of ground saturated with\r\noil were in flames, enveloping ninety or a hundred persons. Men digging\r\nthe ditch or dipping the oil wilted like leaves in a gale. Horrible\r\nshrieks rent the air. Dense volumes of black smoke ascended. Tongues of\r\nflame leaped hundreds of feet. One poor fellow, charred to the bone,\r\ndied screaming with agony over his supposed arrival in hell. Victims\r\nperished scarcely a step from safety. Rouse stood near the derrick at\r\nthe fatal moment. Blinded by the first flash, he stumbled forward and\r\nfell into the marshy soil. Throwing valuable papers and a wallet of\r\nmoney beyond the circuit of fire, he struggled to his feet, groped a\r\ndozen paces and fell again. Two men dashed into the sea of flame and\r\ndragged him forth, his flesh baked and his clothing a handful of shreds.\r\nHe was carried to a shanty and gasped through five hours of excruciating\r\ntorture. His wonderful self-possession never deserted him, no word or\r\nact betraying his fearful suffering. Although obliged to sip water from\r\na spoon at every breath, he dictated a concise will, devising the bulk\r\nof his estate in trust to improve the roads and benefit the poor of\r\nWarren county. Relatives and intimate friends, his clerk and hired boy,\r\nthe men who bore him from the broiling furnace and honest debtors were\r\nremembered. This dire calamity blotted out nineteen lives and disfigured\r\nthirteen men and boys permanently. The blazing oil was smothered with\r\ndirt the third day. Tubing was put in the well, which flowed\r\nten-thousand barrels in a week and then ceased. Nothing is left to mark\r\nthe scene of the sad tragedy. The Merrick, Wadsworth, Haldeman, Clark &\r\nBanks, Trundy, Comet and Imperial wells, the tanks and the dwellings\r\nhave been obliterated. Dr. S. S. Christy—he was Oil City’s first\r\ndruggist—Allen Wright, N. F. Jones, W. B. Williams and William H.\r\nKinter, five of the six witnesses to Rouse’s remarkable will, are in\r\neternity, Z. Martin alone remaining.\r\n\r\nWarren’s greatest benefactor, the interest of the half-million dollars\r\nRouse bequeathed to the county has improved roads, constructed bridges\r\nand provided a poor-house at Youngsville. Rouse was distinguished for\r\nnoble traits, warm impulses, strong attachments, energy and decision of\r\ncharacter. He dispensed his bounty lavishly. It was a favorite habit to\r\npick up needy children, furnish them with clothes and shoes and send\r\nthem home with baskets of provisions. He did not forget his days of\r\ntrial and poverty. His religious views were peculiar. While reverencing\r\nthe Creator, he despised narrow creeds, deprecated popular notions of\r\nworship and had no dread of the hereafter. To a preacher, in the little\r\ngroup that watched his fading life, who desired an hour before the end\r\nto administer consolation, he replied: “My account is made up. If I am a\r\ndebtor, it would be cowardly to ask for credit now. I do not care to\r\ndiscuss the matter.” He directed that his funeral be without display,\r\nthat no sermon be preached and that he be laid beside his mother at\r\nWestfield, New York. Thus lived and died Henry R. Rouse, of small\r\nstature and light frame, but dowered with rare talents and heroic soul.\r\nPerhaps at the Judgment Day, when deeds outweigh words, many a strict\r\nPharisee may wish he could change places with the man whose memory the\r\npoor devoutly bless. As W. A. Croffut has written of James Baker in “The\r\nMine at Calumet”:\r\n\r\n                 “‘Perfess’? He didn’t perfess. He hed\r\n                   One simple way all through—\r\n                 He merely practiced an’ he sed\r\n                   That that wud hev to do.\r\n                 ‘Under conviction’? The idee!\r\n                   He never done a thing\r\n                 To be convicted fer. Why, he\r\n                   Wuz straighter than a string.”\r\n\r\nSeventy-five wells were drilled on Hamilton McClintock’s four-hundred\r\nacres in 1860-1. Here was Cary’s “oil-spring” and expectations of big\r\nwells soared high. The best yielded from one-hundred to three-hundred\r\nbarrels a day. Low prices and the war led to the abandonment of the\r\nsmaller brood. A company bought the farm in 1864. McClintockville, a\r\npromising village on the flat, boasted two refineries, stores, a hotel\r\nand the customary accessories, of which the bridge over Oil Creek is the\r\nsole reminder. Near the upper boundary of the farm the Reno Railroad\r\ncrossed the valley on a giddy center-trestle and timber abutments, not a\r\nsplinter of which remains. General Burnside, the distinguished\r\ncommander, superintended the construction of this mountain-line,\r\ndesigned to connect Reno and Pithole and never completed. Occasionally\r\nthe dignified general would be hailed by a soldier who had served under\r\nhim. It was amusing to behold a greasy pumper, driller or teamster step\r\nup, clap Burnside on the shoulder, grasp his hand and exclaim: “Hello,\r\nGeneral! Deuced glad to see you! I was with you at Fredericksburg! Come\r\nand have a drink!”\r\n\r\nThe Clapp farm of five-hundred acres had a fair allotment of long-lived\r\nwells. George H. Bissell and Arnold Plumer bought the lower half, in the\r\nclosing days of 1859, from Ralph Clapp. The Cornplanter Oil Company\r\npurchased the upper half. The Hemlock, Cuba, Cornwall—a\r\nthousand-barreler—and Cornplanter, on the latter section, were notably\r\nproductive. The Williams, Stanton, McKee, Elizabeth and Star whooped it\r\nup on the Bissell-Plumer division. Much of the oil in 1862-3 was from\r\nthe second sand. Four refineries flourished and the tract coined money\r\nfor its owners. A mile east was the prolific Shaw farm, which put\r\ntwo-hundred-thousand dollars into Foster W. Mitchell’s purse. Graff &\r\nHasson’s one-thousand acres, part of the land granted Cornplanter in\r\n1796, had a multitude of medium wells that produced year after year. In\r\n1818 the Indian chief, who loved fire-water dearly, sold his reservation\r\nto William Connely, of Franklin, and William Kinnear, of Centre county,\r\nfor twenty-one-hundred-and-twenty-one dollars. Matthias Stockberger\r\nbought Connely’s half in 1824 and, with Kinnear and Reuben Noyes,\r\nerected the Oil-Creek furnace, a foundry, mill, warehouses and\r\nsteamboat-landing at the east side of the mouth of the stream. William\r\nand Frederick Crary acquired the business in 1825 and ran it ten years.\r\nWilliam and Samuel Bell bought it in 1835 and shut down the furnace in\r\n1849. The Bell heirs sold it to Graff, Hasson & Co. in 1856 for\r\nseven-thousand dollars. James Hasson located on the property with his\r\nfamily and farmed five years. Graff & Hasson sold three-hundred\r\nacres in 1864 to the United Petroleum Farms Association for\r\nseven-hundred-and-fifty-thousand dollars. James Halyday settled on the\r\neast side in 1803. His son James, the first white baby in the\r\nneighborhood, was born in 1809. The Bannon family came in the forties,\r\nThomas Moran built the Moran House—it still lingers—in 1845 and died in\r\n1857. Dr. John Nevins arrived in 1850 and in the fall of 1852 John P.\r\nHopewell started a general store. Hiram Gordon opened the “Red Lion\r\nInn,” Samuel Thomas shod horses and three or four families occupied\r\nsmall habitations. And this was the place, when 1860 dawned, that was to\r\nbecome the petroleum-metropolis and be known wherever men have heard a\r\nword of “English as she is spoke.”\r\n\r\nCornplanter was the handle of the humble settlement, towards which a\r\nstampede began with the first glimmer of spring. To trace the uprising\r\nof dwellings, stores, wharves and boarding-houses would be as difficult\r\nas perpetual motion. People huddled in shanties and lived on barges\r\nmoored to the bank. Derricks peered up behind the houses, thronged the\r\nmarshy flats, congregated on the slopes, climbed the precipitous bluffs\r\nand established a foothold on every ledge of rock. Pumping-wells and\r\nflowing-wells scented the atmosphere with gas and the smell of crude.\r\nSmoke from hundreds of engine-houses, black, sooty and defiling,\r\ndiscolored the grass and foliage. Mud was everywhere, deep, unlimited,\r\nuniversal—yellow mud from the newer territory—dark, repulsive, oily mud\r\naround the wells—sticky, tricky, spattering mud on the streets and in\r\nthe yards. J. B. Reynolds, of Clarion county, and Calvin and William J.\r\nMcComb, of Pittsburg, opened the first store under the new order of\r\nthings in March of 1860. T. H. and William M. Williams joined the firm.\r\nThey withdrew to open the Pittsburg store next door. Robson’s\r\nhardware-store was farther up the main street, on the east side, which\r\nended abruptly at Cottage Hill. William P. Baillee—he lives in\r\nDetroit—and William Janes built the first refinery, on the same street,\r\nin 1861, a year of unexampled activity. The plant, which attracted\r\npeople from all parts of the country—Mr. Baillee called it a\r\n“pocket-still”—was enlarged into a refinery of five stills, with an\r\noutput of two-hundred barrels of refined oil every twenty-four hours.\r\nFire destroyed it and the firm built another on the flats near by. On\r\nthe west side, at the foot of a steep cliff, Dr. S. S. Christy opened a\r\ndrug-store. Houses, shops, offices, hotels and saloons hung against the\r\nside of the hill or sat loosely on heaps of earth by the creek and\r\nriver. One evening a half-dozen congenial spirits met in Williams &\r\nBrother’s store. J. B. Reynolds, afterwards a banker, who died several\r\nyears since, thought Cornplanter ought to be discarded and a new name\r\ngiven the growing town. He suggested one which was heartily approved.\r\nLiquid refreshments were ordered and the infant was appropriately\r\nbaptized OIL CITY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAIN STREET, EAST SIDE OF OIL CREEK, OIL CITY, IN 1861.]\r\n\r\nPeter Graff was laid to rest years ago. The venerable James Hasson\r\nsleeps in the Franklin cemetery. His son, Captain William Hasson, is an\r\nhonored resident of the city that owes much to his enterprise and\r\nliberality. Capable, broad-minded and trustworthy, he has been earnest\r\nin promoting the best interests of the community, the region and the\r\nstate. A recent benefaction was his splendid gift of a public park—forty\r\nacres—on Cottage Hill. He was the first burgess and served with\r\nconspicuous ability in the council and the legislature. Alike as a\r\nproducer, banker, citizen, municipal officer and lawgiver, Captain\r\nHasson has shown himself “every inch a manly man.”\r\n\r\nWhen you talk of any better town than Oil City, of any better section\r\nthan the oil-regions, of any better people than the oilmen, of any\r\nbetter state than Pennsylvania, “every potato winks its eye, every\r\ncabbage shakes its head, every beet grows red in the face, every onion\r\ngets stronger, every sheaf of grain is shocked, every stalk of rye\r\nstrokes its beard, every hill of corn pricks up its ears, every foot of\r\nground kicks” and every tree barks in indignant dissent.\r\n\r\nSuch was the narrow ravine, nowhere sixty rods in width, that figured so\r\ngrandly as the Valley of Petroleum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARMS ON OIL CREEK, VENANGO COUNTY, PA., IN 1860-65.]\r\n\r\n                         A SPLASH ON OIL CREEK.\r\n\r\n          The dark mud of Oil Creek!

Live operators\r\nquickly learned that big wells could be found away from the low banks of\r\nOil Creek. Anon they climbed the hills, ascended the ravines and invaded\r\nthe near townships. Very naturally the tributary streams were favored at\r\nfirst, until experience inspired courage and altitude failed to be a\r\nserious obstacle. In this way many juicy streaks were encountered,\r\nbroadening men’s ideas and the area of profitable developments to a\r\nmarvelous degree. Alaska nuggets are fly-specks compared with the golden\r\nspoil garnered from oil-wells on scores of farms in Allegheny,\r\nCherrytree and Cornplanter. Tales of the petroleum-seesaw’s ups and\r\ndowns, without any “mixture rank of midnight weeds” that savor of\r\n“something rotten in Denmark,” need no Klondyker’s imagination,\r\nmeasureless as the ice-floes of the Yukon, to awaken interest and be\r\nworthy of attention.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the romance, the pathos, the tragedy and the startling\r\nincidents of the oil-regions thirty years ago the gold-excitements of\r\nCalifornia and Australia and the diamond-fever of South Africa are tame\r\nand vapid. Prior to the oil-development settlers in the back-townships\r\nlived very sparingly. Children grew up simple-minded and untutored. The\r\nsale of a pig or a calf or a turkey was an event looked forward to for\r\nmonths. Petroleum made not a few of these rustics wealthy. Families that\r\nhad never seen ten dollars suddenly owned hundreds-of-thousands.\r\nLawless, reckless, wicked communities sprang up. The close of the war\r\nflooded the region with paper-currency and bold adventurers. Leadville\r\nor Cheyenne at its zenith was a camp-meeting compared with Pithole,\r\nPetroleum Centre or Babylon. Men and women of every degree of decency\r\nand degradation huddled as closely as the pig-tailed Celestials in\r\nChinatown. Millions of dollars were lost in bogus stock-companies.\r\nAmerican history records no other such era of riotous extravagance. The\r\nmillionaire and the beggar of to-day might change places to-morrow.\r\nBlind chance and consummate rascality were equally potent. Of these\r\ncenters of sin and speculation, strange transformations and wild\r\nexcesses, scarcely a trace remains. Where hosts of fortune-seekers and\r\ndevotees of pleasure strove and struggled nothing is to be seen save the\r\nbare landscape, a growth of underbrush or a grassy field. Sodom was not\r\nblotted out more completely than Pithole, the type of many oil-towns\r\nthat have been utterly exterminated.\r\n\r\nNorth and west of the lower McElhenny farm, at the bend in Oil Creek,\r\nlay John Benninghoff’s two big blocks of land, through which Benninghoff\r\nRun flowed southward. Pioneer Run crossed the north-east corner of the\r\nproperty, the greater part of which was on the hills. Five acres on Oil\r\nCreek and the slopes on Pioneer Run were first developed. Leases for a\r\ncash-bonus and liberal royalty were gobbled greedily. Up Benninghoff Run\r\nand back of the hills operations spread. For one piece of ground the\r\nowner declined tempting offers, because he would not permit his\r\npotato-patch to be trodden down! Some wells pumped and some flowed from\r\ntwenty-five to three-hundred barrels a day seven days in the week.\r\nWilliam Jenkins, the Huidekoper Oil-Company, the DeKalb Oil-Company and\r\nEdward Harkins had regular bonanzas. The Lady Herman, which Robert\r\nHerman had the politeness to name for his wife, was a genuine beauty.\r\nThe first well ever cased and the first pump-station—it hoisted oil to\r\nShaffer—were on the hillside at the mouth of Benninghoff Run. The\r\nplatoon of wells in the illustration of that locality, as they appeared\r\nin 1866, includes these and a hint of the barn beside the homestead. The\r\nbusy scene—pictured now for the first time—was photographed within an\r\nhour of its obliteration. The artist had not finished packing his outfit\r\nwhen lightning struck one of the derricks and a disastrous fire swept\r\nthe hill as bare as Old Mother Hubbard’s cupboard! Wealth deluged the\r\nthrifty land-holder, oil converting his broad acres into a veritable\r\nGolconda. He awoke one morning to find himself rich. He was awakened one\r\nnight to find himself famous, the newspapers devoting whole pages—under\r\n“scare-heads”—to the unpretending farmer in the southern end of Cherry\r\ntree. “And thereby hangs a tale.”\r\n\r\nSuspicious of banks, Benninghoff stored his money at home. Purchasing a\r\ncheap safe, he placed it in a corner of the sitting-room and stocked it\r\nwith a half-million dollars in gold and greenbacks! Cautious friends\r\nwarned him to be careful, lest thieves might “break through and steal.”\r\nJames Saeger, of Saegertown, a handsome, popular young fellow, who\r\nsometimes played cards, heard of the treasure in the flimsy receptacle.\r\n“Jim” belonged to a respectable family and had been a merchant at\r\nMeadville. Napoleon melted silver statues of the apostles to put the\r\nprecious metal in circulation and Saeger concluded to give Benninghoff’s\r\npile an airing. He spoke to George Miller of the ease with which the\r\nsafe could be cracked and engaged two Baltimore burglars, McDonald and\r\nElliott, to manage the job. Jacob Shoppert, of Saegertown, and Henry\r\nGeiger, who worked for Benninghoff and slept in the house, were\r\nenlisted. The deed, planned with extreme care not to miss fire, was\r\nfixed for a night when Joseph Benninghoff, the son, was to attend a\r\ndance.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday evening, January sixteenth, 1868, Saeger, Shoppert,\r\nMcDonald and Elliott left Saegertown in a two-horse sleigh for\r\nPetroleum Centre, twenty-nine miles distant. At midnight they knocked\r\nat Benninghoff’s door. Geiger answered the rap and was quickly gagged,\r\nsaid to be as arranged previously. John Benninghoff, his wife and\r\ndaughter were bound and the experts proceeded to open the safe. The\r\nfrail structure was soon ransacked. The marauders bundled up their\r\nbooty, sampled Mrs. Benninghoff’s pies, drank a gallon of milk and\r\ndeparted at their leisure, leaving the inmates of the house securely\r\ntied. Joseph returned in an hour or two and relieved the prisoners\r\nfrom their unpleasant predicament. An examination of the safe showed\r\nthat two-hundred-and-sixty-five-thousand dollars had been taken! The\r\nbulk of this was in gold. A package of two-hundred-thousand dollars,\r\nin large bills, done up in a brown paper, the looters passed\r\nunnoticed! The alarm was given, the wires flashed the news everywhere\r\nand the press teemed with sensational reports. By noon on Friday the\r\noil-regions had been set agog and people all over the United States\r\nwere talking of “the Great Benninghoff Robbery.”\r\n\r\nSaegar and his pals drove back and stopped at Louis Warlde’s hotel to\r\ndivide the spoils. McDonald, Elliott and Saeger took the lion’s share,\r\nGeiger and Shoppert received smaller sums and Warlde accepted\r\nthirteen-hundred dollars for his silence. The Baltimore toughs lingered\r\nin the neighborhood a week and then sought the wintry climate of Canada,\r\nSaeger staying around home. Intense excitement prevailed. Hundreds of\r\ndetectives, eager to gain reputation and the reward of ten-thousand\r\ndollars, spun theories and looked wise. Ex-Chief-of-Police Hague, of\r\nPittsburg, was especially alert. For three months the search was vain.\r\nGeorge Miller, whom McDonald wished to put out of the road “to keep his\r\nmouth shut,” in a quarrel with Saeger over a game of cards, blurted out:\r\n“I know about the Benninghoff robbery!” Saeger pacified Miller with a\r\nthousand dollars, which the latter scattered quickly. Jacob Shoppert was\r\nhis boon companion and the pair spent money at a rate that caused\r\nofficers to shadow them. Shoppert visited a town on the edge of Ohio and\r\nwas arrested. Calling for a pen and paper, he wrote to Louis Warlde, the\r\nSaegertown hotel-keeper, reproaching him for not sending money. The\r\njailer handed the detectives the letter, on the strength of which\r\nWarlde, who had started a brewery in Ohio, and Miller were arrested. The\r\nthree were convicted and sentenced to a short term in the penitentiary.\r\nGeiger’s complicity in the plot could not be proved beyond a doubt and\r\nhe was acquitted. Officer Hague captured McDonald and Elliott in\r\nToronto, but Canadian lawyers picked flaws in the papers and they could\r\nnot be extradited. Escaping to Europe, they were heard of no more.\r\nSaeger, who had not been suspected until after his departure, went west\r\nand was lost sight of for many a day.\r\n\r\nThree years later a noted cattle king of the Texas-Colorado trail\r\nentered a saloon in Denver to treat a party of friends. The bar-tender,\r\nGus. Peiflee, formerly of Meadville, recognized the customer as “Jim.”\r\nSaeger. He telegraphed east and Chief-of-Police Rouse, of Titusville,\r\nposted off to Denver with Joseph Benninghoff. They secured\r\nextradition-papers and arrested Saeger, who coolly remarked: “You’ll be\r\na devilish sight older before you see me in Pennsylvania.” Their lawyers\r\ninformed them that a hundred of Saeger’s cowboys were in the\r\ncity—reckless, lawless fellows, certain to kill whoever attempted to\r\ntake him away. Rouse and Benninghoff dropped the matter and returned\r\nalone. Saeger is living in Texas, prosperous and respected. He is just\r\nin his dealings, a bountiful giver, and not long ago sent five-thousand\r\ndollars to the widow of George Miller. Perhaps he may yet turn up in\r\nWashington as Congressman or United-States Senator. This is the story of\r\na robbery that attracted more attention than the first woman in\r\nbloomers.\r\n\r\nJohn Benninghoff was born in Lehigh county, where his ancestors were\r\namong the first German immigrants, on Christmas Day, 1801. His father,\r\nFrederick Benninghoff, settled near New Berlin, Union county, in John’s\r\nboyhood. There the son married Elizabeth Heise in 1825 and in 1828\r\nlocated on a farm near Oldtown, Clearfield county. Thence he removed to\r\nVenango county, living close to Cherry tree village four years. In 1836\r\nhe bought a piece of land on the south border of Cherrytree township,\r\nnear what was to become Petroleum Centre. He added to his purchase as\r\nhis means permitted, until he owned about three-hundred acres, with\r\nsolid buildings and modern improvements. He was in easy circumstances\r\nprior to the oil-developments that enriched him. Contrary to the general\r\nopinion, the robbery did not impoverish him, as one-half the money was\r\nuntouched. His twelve children—eight boys and four girls—grew up and\r\neight are still living. Selling his farms in Venango, he removed to\r\nGreenville, Mercer county, in the spring of 1868 and died in March,\r\n1882. At his death he had sixty-one grandchildren and fifteen\r\ngreat-grandchildren. He left his family a large estate. The Benninghoff\r\nfarms, so far as oil is concerned, are utterly deserted.\r\n\r\nWest and north of Benninghoff were the farms of John and R. Stevenson.\r\nOn the former, extending south to Oil Creek, Reuben Painter, a live\r\noperator, drilled a well in 1863. The contractor reporting it dry,\r\nPainter moved the machinery and surrendered the lease. He and his\r\nbrothers operated profitably in Butler and McKean counties, Reuben dying\r\nat Olean in 1892. In November of 1864 the Ocean Oil-Company of\r\nPhiladelphia bought John Stevenson’s lands. The Ocean well began flowing\r\nat a six-hundred-barrel pace on September first, 1865, with the Arctic a\r\ngood second. Fifty others varied from fifty to two-hundred barrels.\r\nThomas McCool built a refinery and the farm paid the company about\r\ntwo-thousand per cent! The principal wells on both Stevenson tracts\r\nclustered far above the flats, the derricks and buildings resembling “a\r\ncity set on a hill.” Major Mills, justly proud of his King of the Hills,\r\nan elegant producer, delighted to visit it with his wife and two young\r\ndaughters, one of them now Mrs. John D. Archbold, of New York. Painter’s\r\nsupposed dry-hole, drilled seventeen feet deeper, gushed furiously,\r\nproving to be the best well in the collection! Said the Ocean manager,\r\nas he watched the oily stream ascend “higher ’n a steeple”: “A million\r\ndollars wouldn’t touch one side of this property!” Sinking a four-inch\r\nhole seventeen feet farther would have given Reuben Painter this\r\nsplendid return two years earlier! He missed a million dollars by only\r\nseventeen feet! A Gettysburg soldier, from whose nose a rifle-ball\r\nshaved a piece of cuticle the size of a pin-head, wittily observed:\r\n“That shot came mighty near missing me!” Inverting this remark, Painter\r\nhad cause to exclaim: “That million came mighty near hitting me!”\r\n\r\n                     “A miss is as good as a mile.”\r\n\r\nVarious companies bored three-hundred wells on Cherrytree Run and its\r\ntiny branches without jarring the trade particularly. Prolific strikes\r\non the Niagara tract, in the rear of the Benninghoff lands, added to the\r\nwealth of Phillips Brothers. Kane City, two miles north of Rynd, raised\r\nCain in mild style, “wearing like leather.” Farther back D. W. Kenney’s\r\nwells, lively as the Kilkenny cats, stirred a current that wafted in\r\nAlemagooselum City. Its unique name, the biggest feature of the “City,”\r\nwas worked out by Kenney, a fun-loving genius, known far and wide as\r\n“Mayor of Alemagooselum.” He and his wells and town have long been “out\r\nof sight.” Kane City casts an attenuated shadow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELLS ON THE NIAGARA TRACT, CHERRYTREE RUN.]\r\n\r\nRev. William Elliott, who united in one package the fervor of Paul and\r\nthe snap of Ebenezer Elliott, “the Corn-Law Rhymer,” lived and preached\r\nat Rynd. He organized a Sunday-school in Kenney’s parish, which a devout\r\nsettler undertook to superintend. At the close of the regular service on\r\nthe opening day, Mr. Elliott asked the pious ruralist to “say a few\r\nwords.” The good man, wishing to clinch the lesson—about Mary\r\nMagdalene—in the minds of the youngsters, implored them to follow the\r\nexample of “Miss Magdolin.” The older brood tittered at this\r\nHibernianism, the laugh swelled into a cloudburst. Mr. Elliott nearly\r\nswallowed his pocket-handkerchief trying to shut in his smiles and a new\r\nquery was born, which had a long run. It was fired at every visitor to\r\nthe settlement. Small boys hurled it at the defenceless superintendent,\r\nwho resigned his job and broke up the school the next Sunday. Possibly\r\nBr’er Elliott, when ushered into Heaven, would not be one whit surprised\r\nto hear some white-winged cherub from Alemagooselum sing out: “Say, do\r\nyou know Miss Mag Dolin?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISHING OUT THE PREACHER’S HORSE.]\r\n\r\nThe scanty herbage on the tail of the parson’s horse gave rise to\r\nendless surmises. The animal stranded in a mud-hole and keeled over on\r\nhis side. Four sturdy fellows tried to fish him out. In his misguided\r\nzeal one of the rescuers, tugging at the caudal appendage, pulled so\r\nhard that half the hair peeled off, leaving the denuded nag a fitting\r\nmate for Tam O’Shanter’s tailless Meg.\r\n\r\nA Kane-City youngster prayed every morning and night that a well her\r\nfather was drilling would be a good one. It was a hopeless failure,\r\nfinished the day before Christmas. The result disturbed the child\r\nexceedingly. That night, as the loving mother was preparing her for bed,\r\nthe little girl observed: “I dess it’s no use prayin’ till after Kismas,\r\n’cos God’s so busy helpin’ Santa Claus He hasn’t time for nobody else!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VAMPIRE AND WADE WELLS-CHERRY RUN\r\n  OLD REED WELL\r\n  W. REED\r\n  ROUSEVILLE 1868\r\n  MT. PISCAH, NEAR ROUSEVILLE\r\n]\r\n\r\nCherry Run, once the ripest cherry in the orchard, had a satisfactory\r\nrun. A spice of romance flavored its actual realities. Not two miles up\r\nthe stream William Reed, in 1863, drilled a dry-hole six-hundred feet\r\ndeep. Two miles farther, in the vicinity of Plumer, a test well was sunk\r\nseven-hundred feet, with no better result. Wells near the mouth of the\r\nravine produced very lightly. Fifty-thousand dollars would have been an\r\nextreme price for all the land from Rouseville to Plumer, the tasteful\r\nvillage Henry McCalmont named in honor of Arnold Plumer. In May of 1864\r\nTaylor & Rockwell opened a fresh vein on the run. At two-hundred feet\r\ntheir well threw oil above the derrick and flowed sixty barrels a day\r\nregularly. Operators reversed their opinion of the territory. To the\r\nsurprise of his acquaintances, who deemed him demented, Reed started\r\nanother well four rods below his failure of the previous year. It was on\r\nthe right bank of the run, on a five-acre patch bought from John Rynd in\r\n1861 by Thomas Duff, who sold two acres to Robert Criswell. Reed was not\r\nover-stocked with cash and Criswell joined forces with him to sink the\r\nsecond well. I. N. Frazer took one-third interest. At the proper depth\r\nthe outlook was gloomy. The sand appeared good, but days of pumping\r\nfailed to bring oil. On July eighteenth, 1864, the well commenced\r\nflowing three-hundred barrels a day, holding out at this rate for\r\nmonths. Criswell realized thirty-thousand dollars from his share of the\r\noil and then sold his one-fourth interest in the land and well for\r\ntwo-hundred-and-eighty-thousand to the Mingo Oil-Company. He operated in\r\nthe Butler field, lived at Monterey, removed to Ohio and died near\r\nCincinnati. One son, David S., a well-known producer, resides at Oil\r\nCity; another, Robert W., is on the editorial staff of a New-York daily.\r\nFrazer sold for one-hundred-thousand dollars and next loomed up as “the\r\ndiscoverer of Pithole.” Reed sold to Bishop & Bissell for\r\ntwo-hundred-thousand dollars, after pocketing seventy-five-thousand from\r\noil. Coming to Venango county with Frederic Prentice in 1859, he drilled\r\nwells by contract, sometimes “a solid Muldoon” and sometimes “a broken\r\nReed.” He returned east—his birthplace—with the proceeds of the\r\nworld-famed well bearing his name. An idea haunted him that Captain\r\nKidd’s treasure was buried at a certain part of the Atlantic coast. He\r\nboarded at a house on the shore and hunted land and sea for the hidden\r\ndeposit. He would dig in the sand, sail out some distance and peer into\r\nthe water. One day he went off in his skiff, a storm arose, the boat\r\ndrifted away and that was the last ever seen of William Reed. He was a\r\nliberal supporter of the United-Presbyterian church and his nearest\r\nrelatives live in the vicinity of Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nThe Reed well put Cherry Run at the head of the procession. Within sixty\r\ndays it enriched Reed, Criswell and Frazer nearly seven-hundred-thousand\r\ndollars. The new owners drilled three more on the same acre, getting\r\nback every cent of their purchase-money and fifty per cent. extra for\r\ngood measure. In other words, the five-acre collection of rocks and\r\nstumps, with eleven producing wells and one duster, harvested\r\ntwo-million dollars! The Mountain well mounted high, the Phillips &\r\nEgbert was a fillip and the Wadsworth & Wynkoop rolled out oil in wads\r\nworth a wine-coop of gold-eagles. The fever to lease or buy a spot to\r\nplant a derrick burned fiercely. The race to gorge the ravine with rigs\r\nand drilling appliances would shut out Edgar Saltus in his “Pace that\r\nKills.” Soon three-hundred wells lined the flats and lofty banks\r\nguarding the purling streamlet. Clanking tools, wheezy engines and\r\ncreaking pumps assailed the ears. Smoke from a myriad soft-coal fires\r\nattacked the eyes. An endless cavalcade of wagons churned the soil into\r\nvicious batter. The activities of the Foster, McElhenny, Farrell,\r\nDavison and Tarr farms were condensed into one surging, foaming caldron,\r\nquickening the pulse-beats and sending the brain see-sawing.\r\n\r\nAcross the run the Curtin Oil-Company farmed out forty acres. The Baker\r\nwell, an October biscuit, flowed one-hundred barrels a day all the\r\nwinter of 1864-5 and pumped six years. Water, bane of flannel-suits and\r\nuncased oil-wells, deluged it and its neighbors. Hugh Cropsey, a\r\nNew-York lawyer and last owner of the well nearest the Baker, “ran\r\nengine,” saved a trifle, pulled up stakes in 1869 and tried his luck at\r\nPleasantville. Returning to Cherry Run, he resuscitated a well on the\r\nhill and was suffocated by gas in a tank containing a few inches of\r\nfresh crude. His heirs sold me the old well, which pumped nine months\r\nwithout varying ten gallons in any week and repaid twice its cost.\r\nUnchangeable as the laws of the Medes and Persians, its production was\r\nthe steadiest in the chronicles of grease. One Saturday evening N. P.\r\nStone, superintendent of the St. Nicholas Oil-Company, bought it from me\r\nat the original price. His men took charge of it at noon on Tuesday. At\r\nfive o’clock the well quit forever, “too dead to skin!” Cleaning out,\r\ndrilling deeper, casing, torpedoing and weeks of pumping could not\r\npersuade it to shed another drop of oil or water. This close shave was a\r\nsmall by-play in a realistic drama teeming with incidents far stranger\r\nthan “The Strange Adventures of Miss Brown.” B. H. Hulseman, president\r\nof the St. Nicholas Oil-Company, was a wealthy leather-merchant in\r\nPhiladelphia. He spent much of his time on Cherry Run, lost heavily in\r\nspeculations, entered the oil-exchange and died at Oil City.\r\nKind-hearted, sincere and unpretending, his good remembrance is a legacy\r\nto cherish lovingly.\r\n\r\n                      “Nothing in his life\r\n               Became him like the leaving it; he died\r\n               As one who had been studied in his death,\r\n               To throw away the dearest thing he owned,\r\n               As ’twere a careless trifle.”\r\n\r\nTwo-hundred yards above the Baker a half-dozen wells crowded upon a\r\nhalf-acre. True to its title, the Vampire sucked the life-blood from its\r\npal and produced bounteously. The Munson, owned by the first sacrifice\r\nto nitro-glycerine, sustained the credit of its environment. The Wade\r\nwas the star-performer of the group. James Wade, an Ohio teamster,\r\nearned money hauling oil. Concluding to wade in, he secured a bantam\r\nlease and engaged Thomas Donnelly to drill a well. It surpassed the\r\nReed, flowing four-hundred barrels a day at the start. Frank Allen,\r\nagent of a gilt-edged New-York company, rode from Oil City to see a well\r\ndescribed to him as “livelier than chasing a greased pig at a\r\ncounty-fair.” His exalted conceptions of petroleum befitted the\r\nrepresentative of a company capitalized at three-millions, in which\r\nAugust Belmont, Russell Sage and William B. Astor were said to be\r\nstockholders. The fuming, gassing stream of oil suited him to a t. “I’ll\r\ngive you three-hundred-thousand dollars for it,” he said to Wade, whom\r\nthe offer well-nigh paralyzed. The two men went into the grocery close\r\nby, Wade signed a transfer of the well and Allen handed him a New-York\r\ndraft. The happiest being in the pack, Wade packed his carpet-bag,\r\nhitched his horses to the wagon, bade the boys good-bye and drove to Oil\r\nCity to get the paper cashed. He wore greasy clothes and did not wear\r\nthe air of a millionaire. “Is Mr. Bennett in?” he asked a clerk at the\r\nbank. “Naw; what do you want?” was the reply. “I want a draft cashed.”\r\n“Oh, you do, eh? I guess I can cash it!” The clerk’s haughty demeanor\r\nfell below zero upon beholding the draft. He invited Wade to be seated.\r\nMr. Bennett, the urbane cashier, returned in a few moments. The bank\r\nhadn’t half the currency to meet the demand on the instant. Wade left\r\ndirections to forward the money to his home in Ohio, where he and his\r\nfaithful steeds landed two days later. He bought fine farms for his\r\nbrothers and himself, invested two-hundred-thousand dollars in\r\ngovernment-bonds and wisely enjoyed, amid the peaceful scenes of\r\nagricultural life, the fruits of his first and last oil-venture. Few\r\nhave been as sensible, for the petroleum-coast is encrusted with\r\nfinancial wrecks—vast fortunes amassed only to be lost on the perilous\r\nsea of speculation. The world has heard of the _prizes_ in the lottery\r\nof oil, while the _blanks_—tenfold more numerous—are glossed over by the\r\nglamour of the Sherman, Empire, Noble, Phillips, Reed and other wells,\r\n“familiar as household words.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER P. CORNEN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY I. BEERS]\r\n\r\nThomas Johnson, of Oil City, held one-eighth of the Curtin interest and\r\nPatrick Johnson had a bevy of patrician wells at the summit of the\r\ntallest hill in the valley. The curtain has been rung down, the lights\r\nare out, the players have dispersed and none can hint of “Too Much\r\nJohnson.” The farm of sixty acres adjacent to the Curtin and the\r\nCriswell nook Hamilton McClintock traded to Daniel Smith in 1858 for a\r\nyoke of oxen. Smith sold it in 1860 for five-hundred dollars and sank\r\nthe cash in a dry-hole on Oil Creek. P. P. Cornen and Henry I. Beers\r\nbought the farm in 1863 for twenty-five-hundred dollars, clearing\r\ntwo-millions from the investment. Cornen served as State-Senator in\r\nConnecticut and died in 1893. His sons operate in Warren county and down\r\nthe Allegheny. Mr. Beers, who settled at McClintockville, for thirty\r\nyears has been prominent in business and politics. He was a California\r\nargonaut, spent three years in San Francisco, built the first house in\r\nthat city after the first great fire and revisited the East to marry\r\n“the girl he left behind him” in 1849. The Yankee well, erratic as\r\nGeorge Francis Train, was the first glory of the Smith tract. The Reed\r\ncaused a rush for one-acre leases at four-thousand-dollars bonus and\r\nhalf the oil. Picking up gold-dollars at every step would have been less\r\nlucrative. The wells were stayers and Daniel Smith was not “a Daniel\r\ncome to judgment” in his estimate of the farm he implored J. W. Sherman\r\nto buy for two-hundred-and-fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nCornen & Beers first leased a half-dozen plots six rods square at\r\none-half royalty. Two New-Englanders and Cyrus A. Cornen, son of Peter\r\nP. Cornen and nephew of Mr. Beers, drilled the first well, the queer\r\nYankee. Some gas and no oil looked promising for a dry-hole, but the\r\nowners put in small tubing and pumped a plump day. They decided to draw\r\nthe tubing, seed-bag higher and try it once more for luck. The tubing\r\nhad been raised only a foot when the well flowed “like Mount Vesuvius\r\nspilling lava.” The flow lasted five minutes, stopped twenty, flowed\r\nfive more, stopped twenty and kept up this program regularly twenty-one\r\nmonths. Sixty barrels a day was the average yield month after month,\r\nuntil one day the Yankee concluded to retire from active duty. Much of\r\nits product sold at ten to thirteen dollars a barrel, enriching all\r\nconcerned. The Yankee boomed the crush for leases and was altogether a\r\ntempting plum. The Auburn, the second well on the Smith farm, was a good\r\nsecond to the Yankee, the Gromiger and Cattaraugus traveled in the\r\none-hundred-and-fifty-barrel class, while the Watkins toed the\r\ntwo-hundred mark, with the Aazin and Fry chasing it closely.\r\n\r\nS. S. Watkins, who died at St. Paul in the fall of 1896, was given a lot\r\nfor a grocery, with the privilege of sinking one well for half the oil.\r\nHe opened the store and sold the oil-right to Wade Brothers for\r\ntwenty-five-hundred dollars. The Wades sold one-eighth of the\r\nworking-interest to the Pittsburg Petroleum-Company, used the proceeds\r\nto drill the hole and stuck the tools in the third sand. The lookout for\r\na paying strike was exceedingly poor, but James Wade held on and tubed\r\nthe well above the tools. It flowed three-hundred barrels a day and Wade\r\nsold his seven-eighths to Frank Allen, who offered the Pittsburg\r\nPetroleum-Company seventy-five-thousand dollars for its eighth. When the\r\nWade declined to fifty barrels the company pulled the tubing, moved the\r\nderrick three feet and drilled another, with no better result. Thereupon\r\nthe Wade was abandoned, after having netted the Great-Republic\r\nOil-Company a quarter-million dead loss. In 1864 Cornen & Beers\r\norganized the Cherry-Valley Oil-Company, sold twelve or fifteen leases\r\nand put down all the other wells themselves. The partnership dissolved\r\nin 1876, Mr. Beers maintaining the farm and Mr. Cornen dying at his\r\nConnecticut home in 1893. The Smith rated among the best properties in\r\nthe region and it still rewards its fortunate owner with a moderate\r\nproduction, although merely a shadow of its former greatness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTER PHIPPS.]\r\n\r\nBlacklegs, thieves and murderers ran little risk of punishment in the\r\nearly days of oil-developments, unless they became unusually\r\nobstreperous and were brought to a period with a shot-gun. Scoundrels\r\nlay in wait for victims at every turn and stories of their misdeeds\r\ncould be told by the hundred. The McFate farm was one of the first on\r\nCherry Run to be sold at a fancy price. S. J. McFate, one of the\r\nbrothers owning the property, two weeks after the sale in 1862, walked\r\ndown to Oil City to draw several-thousand dollars from the bank. He\r\ndisplayed the money freely and left for home late at night. The road was\r\ndark and lonely and next morning, in a clump of bushes a mile above Oil\r\nCity, his lifeless body was discovered. A ghastly wound in the head and\r\nthe absence of the money explained the tragedy and the motive. No clue\r\nto the murderer was ever found, although squads of detectives “worked on\r\nthe case” and queer fictions regarding the mysterious assassin were\r\nprinted in many newspapers.\r\n\r\nQueerly enough, the farms above the Smith were failures. Hundreds of\r\nwells clear up to Plumer never paid the expense of recording the leases.\r\nThe territory was a roast for scores of stock-companies. Below Plumer a\r\nmile Bruns & Ludovici, of New York, built the Humboldt Refinery in 1862.\r\nMoney was lavished on palatial quarters for the managers, enclosed\r\ngrounds, cut-stone walls, a pipe-line to Tarr Farm and the largest\r\nrefining capacity in America. Inconvenient location and improved methods\r\nof competitors forced the Humboldt to retire. Part of the machinery was\r\nremoved, the structures crumbled and some of the dressed stone forms the\r\nfoundations of the National Transit Building at Oil City. Plumer, which\r\nhad a grist-mill, store, blacksmith-shop and tavern in 1840 and\r\nfour-thousand population in 1866, is quiet as its briar-grown graveyard.\r\nThe Brevoort Oil-Company, Murray & Fawcett and John P. Zane raked in\r\nshekels on Moody Run, which emptied into Cherry Run a half-mile\r\nsouth-west of the Reed well. Zane, whole-souled, resolute and manly,\r\noperated in the northern district and died at Bradford in 1894. A\r\n“forty-niner,” he supported John W. Geary for Mayor of San Francisco,\r\nbuilt street-railways and worked gold-mines in California. He wrote on\r\nfinance and petroleum, hated selfishness and stood firmly on the\r\nplatform laid down in the beatitudes by the Man of Galilee.\r\n\r\n                        “The good die first,\r\n              And they whose hearts are dry as summer-dust\r\n              Burn to the socket.”\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1859-60 Robert Phipps, of Clinton township, sold a\r\nhorse to D. Knapp, who owned a farm, “between Plumer and the mouth of\r\nOil Creek,” that extended across Cherry Run some distance above the\r\nSmith patch. Phipps followed up the horse-sale by paying Knapp\r\ntwenty-five dollars and one-eighth the oil for one acre of his land. He\r\ntook A. Lowry for a partner, and sent his son, Porter Phipps, and John\r\nHaas, a German blacksmith, to “kick down” a well. Haas constructed a set\r\nof light tools—the augur stem was one-inch iron—lumber for a shanty and\r\nthe rig was drawn from Hood’s Mill on Pithole Creek and a forty-foot\r\nhemlock served as a spring-pole. Drilling began in April of 1860 at the\r\nfirst well on the bank of Cherry Run. Young Phipps would carry the bit\r\nor the reamer daily on his shoulder to be dressed at a blacksmith-shop\r\non Hamilton McClintock’s farm. The work had continued three months, when\r\none day the tools struck a crevice at a hundred feet, a gurgling sound\r\ngreeted the ears of the expectant drillers and they awaited the flow.\r\nSulphur-water, not oil, was the outcome and the well was abandoned.\r\nRobert Phipps “exchanged mortality for life” at a ripe old age. His\r\nparents settled in Venango county a century ago and the Phipps family\r\nhas always been noted for intelligence and progressiveness. Porter\r\nPhipps, known everywhere as ’Squire, was reared on the farm, had his\r\ninitial tussle with oil-wells in 1860 and operated at Bullion and in\r\nButler county. He is Vice-president of the Monroe Oil-Company and makes\r\nPittsburg his headquarters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. G. SHAMBURG.]\r\n\r\nTwo miles east of Miller-Farm station, on the eighty-acre tract of\r\nOliver Stowell, the Cherry-Run Petroleum-Company finished a well in\r\nFebruary of 1866. It was eight-hundred feet deep, drilled through the\r\nsixth sand and pumped one-hundred barrels a day. The company operated\r\nsystematically, using heavy tools, tall derricks and large casing. It\r\nwas managed by Dr. G. Shamburg, a man of character and ability, who\r\nstudied the strata carefully and gathered much valuable data. The second\r\nwell equalled No. 1 in productiveness and longevity, both lasting for\r\nyears. J. B. Fink’s, a July posy of two-hundred barrels, was the third.\r\nThe grand rush began in December, 1867, the Fee and Jack-Brown wells, on\r\nthe Atkinson farm, flowing four-hundred barrels apiece. A lively town,\r\neligibly located in a depression of the table-lands, was properly named\r\nShamburg, as a compliment to the genial doctor. The Tallman, Goss,\r\nAtkinson and Stowell farms whooped up the production to three-thousand\r\nbarrels. Frank W. and W. C. Andrews, Lyman and Milton Stewart, John W.\r\nIrvin and F. L. Backus had bought John R. Tallman’s one-hundred acres in\r\n1865. Their first well began producing in September, 1867, and in 1868\r\nthey sold two-hundred-thousand barrels of oil for nearly\r\neight-hundred-thousand dollars! A. H. Bronson—bright, alert, keen in\r\nbusiness and popular in society—paid twenty-five-thousand for the\r\nCharles Clark farm, a mile north-east. His first well—three-hundred\r\nbarrels—paid for the property and itself in sixty days. Operations in\r\nthe Shamburg pool were almost invariably profitable and handsome\r\nfortunes were realized. A peculiarity was the presence of green and\r\nblack oils, a line on the eastern part of the Cherry-Run Company’s land\r\ndefining them sharply. Their gravity and general properties were\r\nidentical and the black color was attributed to oxide of iron in the\r\nrock. Dr. Shamburg died at Titusville and the town he founded is taking\r\na perpetual vacation.\r\n\r\nCarl Wageforth, a genius well known in early days as one of the owners\r\nof the Story farm, started a “town” in the woods two miles above\r\nShamburg. The “town” collapsed, Wageforth clung to his store a season\r\nand next turned up in Texas as the founder of a German colony. He\r\nsecured a claim in the Lone-Star State about thrice the size of Rhode\r\nIsland, settled it with thrifty immigrants from the “Faderland” and\r\nbagged a bushel of ducats. He made and lost fortunes in oil and could no\r\nmore be kept from breaking out occasionally than measles or small-pox.\r\n\r\nEast of Petroleum Centre three miles, on the bank of a pellucid stream,\r\nJohn E. McLaughlin drilled a well in 1868 that flowed fourteen-hundred\r\nbarrels. The sand was coarse, the oil dark and the magnitude of the\r\nstrike a surprise equal to the answer of the dying sinner who, asked by\r\nthe minister if he wasn’t afraid to meet an angry God, unexpectedly\r\nreplied: “Not a bit; it’s the other chap I’m afraid of!” Excepting the\r\nhalf-dozen mastodons on Oil Creek, the McLaughlin was the biggest well\r\nin the business up to that date. Wide-awake operators struck a bee-line\r\nfor leases. A town was floated in two weeks, a Pithole grocer erecting\r\nthe first building and labeling the place “Cash-Up” as a gentle hint to\r\npatrons not to let their accounts get musty with age. The name fitted\r\nthe town, which a twelvemonth sufficed to sponge off the slate. Small\r\nwells and dry-holes ruled the roost, even those nudging “the big ’un”\r\nmissing the pay-streak. The McLaughlin—a decided freak—declined\r\ngradually and pumped seven years, having the reservoir all to itself.\r\nLocated ten rods away in any direction, it would have been a duster and\r\nCash-Up would not have existed! A hundred surrounding it did not cash-up\r\nthe outlay for drilling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELLS IN THE PLEASANTVILLE FIELD IN 1871.]\r\n\r\nAttracted by the quality of the soil and the beauty of the\r\nlocation—six-hundred feet above the level of Oil Creek and abundantly\r\nwatered—in 1820 Abraham Lovell forsook his New York farm to settle in\r\nAllegheny township, six miles east by south of Titusville. Aaron\r\nBenedict and Austin Merrick came in 1821. John Brown, the first\r\nmerchant, opened a store in 1833. A pottery, tannery, ashery, store and\r\nshops formed the nucleus of a village, organized in 1850 as the borough\r\nof Pleasantville. Three wells on the outskirts of town, bored in 1865-6,\r\nproduced a trifling amount of oil. Late in the fall of 1867 Abram James,\r\nan ardent spiritualist, was driving from Pithole to Titusville with\r\nthree friends. A mile south of Pleasantville his “spirit-guide” assumed\r\ncontrol of Mr. James and humped him over the fence into a field on the\r\nWilliam Porter farm. Powerless to resist, the subject was hurried to the\r\nnorthern end of the field, contorted violently, jerked through a species\r\nof “couchee-couchee dance” and pitched to the ground! He marked the spot\r\nwith his finger, thrust a penny into the dirt and fell back pale and\r\nrigid. Restored to consciousness, he told his astonished companions it\r\nhad been revealed to him that streams of oil lay beneath and extended\r\nseveral miles in a certain direction. Putting no faith in “spirits” not\r\namenable to flasks, they listened incredulously and resumed their\r\njourney. James negotiated a lease, borrowed money—the “spirit-guide”\r\nneglected to furnish cash—and planted a derrick where he had planted the\r\npenny. On February twelfth, 1868, at eight-hundred-and-fifty feet, the\r\nHarmonial Well No. 1 pumped one-hundred-and-thirty barrels!\r\n\r\nThe usual hurly-burly followed. People who voted the James adventure a\r\nfish-story writhed and twisted to drill near the spirited Harmonial. New\r\nstrikes increased the hubbub and established the sure quality of the\r\nterritory. Scores of wells were sunk on the Porter, Brown, Tyrell,\r\nBeebe, Dunham and other farms for miles. Prices of supplies advanced and\r\nmachine-shops in the oil-regions ran night and day to meet orders. Land\r\nsold at five-hundred to five-thousand dollars an acre, often changing\r\nhands three or four times a day. Interests in wells going down found\r\nwilling purchasers. Strangers crowded Pleasantville, which trebled its\r\npopulation and buildings during the year. It was a second edition of\r\nPithole, mildly subdued and divested of frothy sensationalism. If\r\ngigantic gushers did not dazzle, dry-holes did not discourage. If nobody\r\ncleared a million dollars at a clip, nobody cleared out to avoid\r\ncreditors. Nobody had to loaf and trust to Providence for daily bread.\r\nProvidence wasn’t running a bakery for the benefit of idlers and work\r\nwas plentiful at Pleasantville. The production reached three-thousand\r\nbarrels in the summer of 1868, dropping to fifteen-hundred in 1870.\r\nThree banks prospered and imposing brick-blocks succeeded unsubstantial\r\nframes. Fresh pastures invited the floating mass to Clarion, Armstrong\r\nand Butler. Small wells were abandoned, machinery was shipped southward\r\nand the pretty village moved backward gracefully. Pleasantville had\r\n“marched up the hill and then marched down again.”\r\n\r\nAbram James, a man of fine intellect, nervous temperament and lofty\r\nprinciple, lived at Pleasantville a year. He located a dozen paying\r\nwells in other sections, under the influence of his “spirit-guide.” The\r\nHarmonial was his greatest hit, bringing him wealth and distinction. His\r\nworst break—a dry-hole on the Clarion river eighteen-hundred feet\r\ndeep—cost him six-thousand dollars in 1874. None questioned his absolute\r\nsincerity, although many rejected his theories of the supernatural.\r\nWhether he is still in the flesh or has become a spirit has not been\r\nmanifested to his old friends in Oildom.\r\n\r\nSamuel Stewart, an old resident and prosperous land-owner, is a leading\r\ncitizen of Cherrytree township. He operated successfully in his own\r\nneighborhood and around Pleasantville. His acquaintance with men and\r\naffairs is not surpassed in Venango county. He is half-brother of Mrs.\r\nWilliam R. Crawford, Franklin. Lyman and Milton Stewart, of Titusville,\r\nhave not stayed in the rear. They drilled hundreds of wells in\r\nPennsylvania and invested liberally in California territory. Good men\r\nand true are the Stewarts from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL STEWART.]\r\n\r\nRed-Hot, in the palmy era of the Shamburg excitement a place of much\r\nsultriness, is cold enough to chill any stray visitor who knew the\r\nmushroom at its warmest stage. Windsor Brothers, of Oil City—they\r\nbuilt the Windsor Block—drilled a well in 1869 that flowed\r\nthree-hundred-and-fifty barrels. Others followed rapidly, people\r\nflocked to the newest centre of attraction and a typical oil-town\r\nstrutted to the front. The territory lacked the staying quality, the\r\nButler region was about to dawn and 1871 saw Red-Hot reduced to three\r\nhouses, a half-dozen light wells and a muddy road. Lightning-rod\r\npedlars, book-agents and medical fakirs no longer disturb its calm\r\nserenity. Not a scrap of the tropical town has been visible for two\r\ndecades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RED-HOT, A TYPICAL OIL-TOWN, IN 1870.]\r\n\r\nTip-Top filled a short engagement. Operations around Shamburg and\r\nPleasantville directed attention to the Captain Lyle and neighboring\r\nfarms, midway between these points. “Ned” Pitcher’s well, drilled in\r\n1866 on the Snedaker farm, east of Lyle, had started at eighty barrels\r\nand pumped twenty for two years. Pithole was booming and nobody thought\r\nof Ned’s pitcher until 1868. Many of the wells produced fairly, but the\r\nterritory soon depreciated and the elevated town—aptly named by a poet\r\nwith an eye to the eternal fitness of things—lost its hold and glided\r\ndown to nothingness. The hundred-eyed Argus could not find a sliver that\r\nwould prick a thumb or tip a top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW AT M’CLINTOCKVILLE IN 1862.]\r\n\r\nPicking cherries was sometimes a mixed operation in the land of grease.\r\n\r\n                             OILY OOZINGS.\r\n\r\nKerosene is often the last scene.\r\n\r\nThe ladies—God bless them!—are nothing if not consistent—at times. It\r\nused to be a fad with Bradford wives to keep a stuffed owl in the parlor\r\nfor ornament and a stuffed club in the hall for the night-owl’s benefit.\r\n\r\n                The Oil-Creek girls are the dandy girls,\r\n                    For their kiss is most intense;\r\n                They’ve got a grip like a rotary-pump\r\n                    That will lift you over the fence.\r\n\r\nThe steel of a rimmer was lost in a drilling well on Cherry Run. After\r\nfishing for it for a longtime the well-owner, becoming discouraged,\r\noffered a man one-thousand dollars to take it out. He broomed the end of\r\na tough block, ran it down the well attached to the tools and in ten\r\nminutes had the steel out.\r\n\r\n            The woman who eagerly seized the oil-can\r\n            And to pour kerosene in the cook-stove began,\r\n            So that people for miles to quench the fire ran,\r\n            While she soar’d aloft like a flash in the pan,\r\n                      Didn’t know it was loaded.\r\n\r\nAt a drilling well near Rouseville the tools were lowered on Monday\r\nmorning and, after running a full screw, were drawn minus the bit, with\r\nthe stem-box greatly enlarged. After fishing several days for it the\r\ndrillers were greatly surprised to find the lost bit standing in the\r\nslack-tub. The tools had been lowered in the darkness with no bit on.\r\n\r\n              An Oil-City tramp on the pavement drear\r\n                Saw something that seem’d to shine;\r\n              He pick’d it up and gave a big cheer—\r\n              ’Twas a nickel bright, the price of a beer—\r\n                And shouted “The world is mine!”\r\n\r\nWilliam McClain, grandfather of Senator S. J. M. McCarrell, Harrisburg,\r\nonce owned and occupied the Tarr farm, on Oil Creek. Fifty or more years\r\nago he sold the tract to James Tarr for a rifle and an old gray horse\r\nnamed Diamond. McClain removed to Washington county and settled on a\r\nfarm which his son inherited and sold before oil was found in the\r\nneighborhood. Like the Tarr farm on Oil Creek, the McClain farm in\r\nWashington county proved a petroleum-bonanza to the purchasers.\r\n\r\n               Said a Shamburg young maiden: “Alas, Will,\r\n                       You come every night,\r\n                       And talk such a sight,\r\n                       And burn so much light,\r\n               My papa declares you’re a Gas Bill!”\r\n\r\nAll kinds of engines, from one to fifty horse-power, were used on Oil\r\nCreek in the sixties. The old “Fabers,” with direct attachment, will\r\nrecall many a broad grin. The boys called them “Long Johns.” The\r\nWallace-engine had hemp-packing on the piston, and the inside of the\r\ncylinder, rough as a rasp, soon used it up and leaked steam like a\r\nsieve. The Washington-engine was the first to come into general use. C.\r\nM. Farrar, of Farrar & Trefts, whose boilers and engines have stood\r\nevery test demanded by improvements in drilling, made the drawing for\r\nthe first locomotive-pattern boiler on a drilling well—a wonderful\r\nstride in advance of the old-time boiler. Trefts made the castings for\r\nthe engine that pumped the Drake well and was the first man, in company\r\nwith J. Willard, to use ropes on Oil Creek in drilling. This was on the\r\nFoster farm, near the world-famed Empire well, in 1860. Willard made the\r\nsecond set of jars on the creek. Senator W. S. McMullan was a stalwart\r\nblacksmith, who made drilling-tools noted for their enduring quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRANT WELL     EUREKA WELL\r\n  GENERAL VIEW OF PITHOLE IN AUG 95\r\n  UNITED STATES WELL     HOLMDEN ST.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IX.\r\n                         A GOURD IN THE NIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE METEORIC CITY THAT DAZZLED MANKIND—FROM NOTHING TO SIXTEEN-THOUSAND\r\n    POPULATION IN THREE MONTHS—FIRST WELLS AND FABULOUS PRICES—NOTED\r\n    ORGANIZATIONS AT PITHOLE—A FORETASTE OF HADES—EXCITEMENT AND\r\n    COLLAPSE—SPECULATION RUN WILD—DUPLICITY AND DISAPPOINTMENT—THE WILD\r\n    SCRAMBLE FOR THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n    “The gourd came up in a night and perished in a night.”—_Jonah,\r\n    iv:10._\r\n\r\n“The earth hath bubbles, as the water has.”—_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n“All things rise to fall and flourish to decay.”—_Sallust._\r\n\r\n“A lively place in days of yore, but something ails it\r\n    now.”—_Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n“Ah! who shall lift that wand of magic power?”—_Longfellow._\r\n\r\n              “Wealth flowed from wood and stream and soil,\r\n              The rock poured forth its amber oil,\r\n                And, lo! a magic city rose.”—_Marjorie Meade._\r\n\r\n“It went up like a rocket and came down like a stick.”—_Thomas Paine._\r\n\r\n“Yet golde all is not that doth golden seeme.”—_Spenser._\r\n\r\n“Can it be that this is all remains of life.”—_Bryon._\r\n\r\n“What it is to eat forbidden fruit and find it a turnip!”—_Flora Annie\r\n    Steel._\r\n\r\n“Old Rhinestein’s walls are crumbled now.”—_Birch Arnold._\r\n\r\n“For this will never hold water again.”—_J.

It\r\nempties into the Allegheny River eight miles above Oil City and was\r\nfirst mentioned by Rev. Alfred Brunson, an itinerant Methodist minister,\r\nin his “Western Pioneer” in 1819. Upheavals of rock left a series of\r\ndeep pits or chasms on the hills near the mouth of the stream. From the\r\nlargest of these holes a current of warm air repels leaves or pieces of\r\npaper. Snow melts around the cavity, which is of unknown depth, and the\r\nair is a mephitic vapor or gas. A story is told of three hunters who,\r\nfinding the snow melted on a midwinter day, determined to investigate.\r\nOne of them swore it was an entrance to the infernal regions and that he\r\nintended to warm himself. He sat on the edge of the hole, dangled his\r\nfeet over the side, thanked the devil for the opportune heat, inhaled\r\nthe gas and tumbled back insensible. His companions dragged him away and\r\nthe investigation ended summarily. Seven miles up the creek, in the\r\nnortheast corner of Cornplanter, Rev. Walter Holmden was a\r\npioneer-settler. Choosing a tract of two-hundred acres, he built a\r\nlog-house on the west bank of the creek, cleared a few acres, struggled\r\nwith poverty and died in 1840. Mr. Holmden was a fervent Baptist\r\npreacher. Thomas Holmden occupied the farm after the good old man’s\r\ndecease, with the Copelands and Blackmers and James Rooker as neighbors.\r\nDevelopments had covered the farms from the Drake well to Oil City.\r\nOperators ventured up the ravines, ascended the hills and began to take\r\nchances miles from either side of Oil Creek. Successful wells on the\r\nAllegheny River broadened opinions regarding the possibilities of\r\npetroleum. Nervy men invaded the eastern portion of Cornplanter, picking\r\nup lands along Pithole Creek and its tributaries. I. N. Frazer, fresh\r\nfrom his triumph on Cherry Run as joint-owner of the Reed well, desired\r\nfresh laurels. He organized the United-States Oil-Company, leased part\r\nof the Holmden farm for twenty years and started a well in the fall of\r\n1864. The primitive derrick was reared in the woods below the Holmden\r\nhome. At six-hundred feet the “sixth sand”—generally called that at\r\nPithole—was punctured. Ten feet farther the tools proceeded, the\r\ndrillers watching intently for signs of oil. On January seventh, 1865,\r\nthe torrent broke loose, the well flowing six-hundred-and-fifty barrels\r\na day and ceasing finally on November tenth. A picture of the well,\r\nshowing Frazer with his back to the tree beside his horse and a group of\r\nvisitors standing around, was secured in May. Kilgore & Keenan’s Twin\r\nwells, good for eight-hundred barrels, were finished on January\r\nseventeenth and nineteenth. The unfathomable mud and disastrous floods\r\nof that memorable season retarded the hegira from other sections, only\r\nto intensify the excitement when it found vent. Duncan & Prather bought\r\nHolmden’s land for twenty-five-thousand dollars and divided the flats\r\nand slopes into half-acre leases. The first of May witnessed a small\r\nclearing in the forest, with three oil-wells, one drilling-well and\r\nthree houses as its sole evidences of human handiwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRAZER WELL, ON HOLMDEN FARM, PITHOLE, IN MAY, 1865.]\r\n\r\nNinety days later the world heard with unfeigned surprise of a “city” of\r\nsixteen-thousand inhabitants, possessing most of the conveniences and\r\nluxuries of the largest and oldest communities! Capitalists eager to\r\ninvest their greenbacks thronged to the scene. Labor and produce\r\ncommanded extravagant figures, every farm for miles was leased or bought\r\nat fabulous rates, money circulated like the measles and for weeks the\r\nfurore surpassed the frantic ebullitions of Wall Street on Black Friday!\r\nNew strikes perpetually inflated the mania. Speculators wandered far and\r\nwide in quest of the subterranean wealth that promised to outrival the\r\ngolden measures of California or the silver-lodes of Nevada. The value\r\nof oil-lands was reckoned by millions. Small interests in single wells\r\nbrought hundreds-of-thousands of dollars. New York, Philadelphia, Boston\r\nand Chicago measured purses in the insane strife for territory. Hosts of\r\nadventurers sought the new Oil-Dorado and the stocks of countless\r\n“petroleum-companies” were scattered broadcast over Europe and America.\r\nAn ambitious operator sold _seventeen_-sixteenths in one well and shares\r\nin leases were purchased ravenously. A half-acre lease on the Holmden\r\nfarm realized bonuses of twenty-four-thousand dollars before a well was\r\ndrilled on the property and the swarm of dealers resembled the plague of\r\nlocusts in Egypt in number and persistence!\r\n\r\nEverything favored the growth of Pithole. The close of the war had left\r\nthe country flooded with paper currency and multitudes of men thrown\r\nupon their own resources. Hundreds of these flocked to the inviting\r\n“city,” which presented manifold inducements to venturesome spirits,\r\nkeen shysters, unscrupulous stock-jobbers, needy laborers and dishonest\r\ntricksters. The post-office speedily ranked third in Pennsylvania,\r\nPhiladelphia and Pittsburg alone excelling it. Seven chain-lightning\r\nclerks assisted Postmaster S. S. Hill to handle the mail. Lines of men\r\nextending a block would await their turns for letters at the\r\ngeneral-delivery. It was a roystering time! Hotels, theaters, saloons,\r\ndrinking-dens, gambling-hells and questionable resorts were counted by\r\nthe score. A fire-department was organized, a daily paper established\r\nand a mayor elected. Railways to Reno and Oleopolis were nearly\r\ncompleted before “the beginning of the end” came with terrible\r\nswiftness. In November and December the wells declined materially. The\r\nlaying of pipe-lines to Miller Farm and Oleopolis, through which the oil\r\nwas forced to points of shipment by steam-pumps, in one week drove\r\nfifteen-hundred teams to seek work elsewhere. Destructive fires\r\naccelerated the final catastrophe. The graphic pen of Dickens would fail\r\nto give an adequate idea of this phenomenal creation, whose career was a\r\nmagnified type of dozens of towns that suddenly arose and as suddenly\r\ncollapsed in the oil-regions of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN A. MATHER.]\r\n\r\nPithole had many wells that yielded freely for some time. The Homestead,\r\non the Hyner farm, finished in June of 1865, proved a gusher. On August\r\nfirst the Deshler started at one-hundred barrels; on August second the\r\nGrant, at four-hundred-and-fifty barrels; on August twenty-eighth the\r\nPool, at eight-hundred barrels; on September fifth the Ogden, at\r\none-hundred barrels, and on September fifteenth Pool & Perry’s No. 47,\r\nat four-hundred barrels. The Frazer improved during the spring to\r\neight-hundred barrels, while the Grant reached seven-hundred in\r\nSeptember. On November twenty-second the Eureka joined the chorus at\r\nfive-hundred barrels. The daily production of the Holmden farm exceeded\r\nfive-thousand barrels for a limited period, with a proportionate yield\r\nof seven-dollar crude from adjacent tracts. John A. Mather, the veteran\r\nTitusville photographer, discarded his camera to become a full-fledged\r\noilman. He bored a well that tinctured the suburban slope of Balltown a\r\nglowing madder. The frenzy spread. J. W. Bonta and James A. Bates paid\r\nJames Rooker two-hundred-and-eighty-thousand dollars for his\r\nhundred-acre farm, south of the Holmden. Rooker, a hard-working tiller\r\nof the soil, lived in a kind of rookery and earned a poor subsistence by\r\nconstant toil. He stuck to the money derived from the sale of his farm,\r\nand he is still living at a goodly age. The Grand Dutch S well would\r\nhave given Lillian Russell new wrinkles in her delineation of the “Grand\r\nDuchess of Gerolstein.” A neighbor refused eight-hundred-thousand\r\ndollars for his barren acres. “I don’t keer ter hev my buckwheat tramped\r\nover,” he explained, “but you kin hev this farm next winter fur a\r\nmillion!” He kept the farm, reaped his crop and was not disturbed until\r\ndeath compelled him to lodge in a plot six by two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAND DUTCH S WELL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF PITHOLE IN THE FALL OF 1865.]\r\n\r\nBonta & Bates did not linger for “two blades of grass to grow where one\r\ngrew before.” Within two months they disposed of ninety leases for\r\nfour-hundred-thousand dollars and half the oil! They spent\r\neighty-thousand on the Bonta House, a sumptuous hostlery. Duncan &\r\nPrather leased building-lots at a yearly rental of one-hundred to\r\none-thousand dollars. First, Second and Holmden streets bristled with\r\nactivity. The Danforth House stood on a lot subleased for\r\nfourteen-thousand dollars bonus. Sixty hotels could not accommodate the\r\ninflux of guests. Beds, sofas and chairs were luxuries for the few.\r\n“First come, first served,” was the rule. The many had to seek the\r\nshaving-pile, the hay-cock or the tender side of a plank. Some mingled\r\npromiscuously in “field-beds”—rows of “shake-downs” on attic floors.\r\nBesides the Bonta and Danforth, the United States, Chase, Tremont,\r\nBuckley, Lincoln, Sherman, St. James, American, Northeast, Seneca,\r\nMetropolitan, Pomeroy and fifty hotels of minor note flourished. If\r\npalaces of sin, gorgeous bar-rooms, business-houses and places of\r\namusement abounded, churches and schools marked the moral sentiment.\r\nFire wiped out the Tremont and adjoining houses in February of 1866.\r\nEighty buildings went up in smoke on May first and June thirteenth.\r\nThirty wells and twenty-thousand barrels of oil went the same road in\r\nAugust. The best buildings were torn down, to bloom at Pleasantville or\r\nOil City. The disappearance of Pithole astonished the world no less than\r\nits marvelous growth. The Danforth House sold for sixteen dollars, to\r\nmake firewood! The railroads were abandoned and in 1876 only six voters\r\nremained. A ruined tenement, a deserted church and traces of streets\r\nalone survive. Troy or Nineveh is not more desolate.\r\n\r\nIn July of 1865 Duncan & Prather granted Henry E. Picket, George J.\r\nSherman and Brian Philpot, of Titusville, a thirty-day option on the\r\nHolmden farm for one-million-three-hundred-thousand dollars. Mr. Sherman\r\narranged to sell the property in New York at sixteen-hundred-thousand!\r\nThe wells already down produced largely, seventy more were drilling and\r\nthe annual ground-rents footed up sixty-thousand dollars. The Ketcham\r\nforgeries tangled the funds of the New-Yorkers and negotiations were\r\nopened with H. H. Honore, of Chicago. After dark on the last day of the\r\noption Honore tendered the first payment—four-hundred-thousand dollars.\r\nIt was declined, on the ground that the business day expired at sundown,\r\nand litigation ensued. A compromise resulted in the transfer of the\r\nproperty to Honore. The deal involved the largest sum ever paid in the\r\noil regions for a single tract of land. The bubble burst so quickly that\r\nthe Chicago purchaser, like Benjamin Franklin, “paid too much for the\r\nwhistle.” Col. A. P. Duncan commanded the Fourth Cavalry Company, the\r\nfirst mustered in Venango county, every member of which carried to the\r\nwar a small Bible presented by Mrs. A. G. Egbert, of Franklin. Tall,\r\nerect, of military bearing and undoubted integrity, he lived at Oil City\r\nand died years ago. Duncan & Prather owned one of the two banks that\r\nhandled car-loads of money in the dizziest town that ever blasted\r\nradiant hopes and shriveled portly pocket-books.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNITED STATES OIL COMPANY'S OFFICE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BONTA HOUSE, PITHOLE.]\r\n\r\nThe Pithole bubble was blown at an opportune moment to catch suckers.\r\nHundreds of oil-companies had come into existence in 1864, hungry for\r\nterritory and grasping at anything within rifle-shot of an actual or\r\nprospective “spouter.” The speculative tide flowed and ebbed as never\r\nbefore in any age or nation. Volumes could be written of amazing\r\ntransitions of fortune. Scores landed at Pithole penniless and departed\r\nin a few months “well heeled.” Others came with “hatfuls of money” and\r\nwent away empty-handed. Thousands of stockholders were bitten as badly\r\nas the sailor, whom the shark nipped off by the waist-band. It was\r\nrather refreshing in its way for “country Reubens” to do up Wall-street\r\nsharpers at their own game. Shrewd Bostonians, New-Yorkers and\r\nPhiladelphians, magnates in business and finance, were snared as readily\r\nas hayseeds who buy green-goods and gold-bricks. There are no flies on\r\nthe smooth, glib Oily Gammon whose mouth yielded more lubricating oil\r\nthan the biggest well on French Creek. His favorite prey was a pilgrim\r\nwith a bursting wallet or the agent of an eastern petroleum-company. A\r\nwell pouring forth three, six, eight, ten, twelve or fifteen-hundred\r\nbarrels of five-dollar crude every twenty-four hours was a spectacle to\r\nfire the blood and turn the brain of the most sluggish beholder. “Such a\r\nwell,” he might calculate, “would make me a millionaire in one year and\r\na Crœsus in ten.” The wariest trout would nibble at bait so tempting.\r\nThe schemer with property to sell had “the very thing he wanted” and\r\nwould “let him in on the ground-floor.” He met men who, driving mules or\r\njigging tools six months ago, were “oil-princes” now. Here lay a tract,\r\n“the softest snap on top of the earth,” only a mile from the Great\r\nGeyser, with a well “just in the sand and a splendid show.” He could\r\nhave it at a bargain-counter sacrifice—one-hundred-thousand dollars and\r\nhalf the oil. The engine had given out and the owner was about to order\r\na new one when called home by the sudden death of his mother-in-law.\r\nSettling the old lady’s estate required his entire attention, therefore\r\nhe would consent to sell his oil-interests “dirt-cheap” to a responsible\r\nbuyer who would push developments. The price ought to be two or three\r\ntimes the sum asked, but the royalty from the big wells sure to be\r\nstruck would ultimately even up matters. The tale was plausible and the\r\nvisitor would “look at the property.” He saw real sand on the\r\nderrick-floor and everything besmeared with grease. The presence of oil\r\nwas unmistakable. Drilling ten feet into the rich rock would certainly\r\ntap the jugular and—glorious thought!—perhaps outdo the Great Geyser\r\nitself. He closed the deal, telegraphed for an engine—he was dying to\r\nsee that stream of oil climbing skywards—and chuckled gleefully. The\r\nkeen edge of his delight might have been dulled had he known that the\r\nwell was _through_, not merely _to_, the sand and absolutely guiltless\r\nof the taint of oil! He did not suspect that barrels of crude and\r\nbuckets of sand from other wells had been dumped into the hole at night,\r\nthat the engine had been disabled purposely and that another innocent\r\nwas soon to cut his wisdom-teeth! He found out when the well “came in\r\ndry” that Justice Dogberry was not a greater ass and that the\r\nfool-killer’s snickersnee was yearning for him. Possibly he might by\r\npersistent drilling find paying wells and get back part of his money,\r\nbut nine times out of ten the investment was a total loss and the\r\ndisgusted victim quit the scene with a new interpretation of the\r\nscriptural declaration: “I was a stranger and ye took me in.” Butler\r\nanticipated Pithole when he wrote in Hudibras:\r\n\r\n             “Make fools believe in their foreseeing\r\n             Of things before they are in being;\r\n             To swallow gudgeons ere they’re catched,\r\n             And count their chickens ere they’re hatched.”\r\n\r\nThe methods of “turning an honest penny” varied to fit the case. To\r\n“doctor” a well by dosing it with a load of oil was tame and\r\ncommonplace. In three instances wells sold at fancy prices were\r\nconnected by underground pipes with tanks of oil at a distance. When the\r\nparties arrived to “time the well” the secret pipe was opened. The oil\r\nran into the tubing and pumped as though coming direct from the sand!\r\nThe deception was as perfect as the oleomargarine the Pennsylvania State\r\nBoard of Agriculture pronounced “dairy butter of superior quality!”\r\n“Seeing is believing” and there was the oil. They had seen it pumping a\r\nsteady stream into the tank, timed it, gauged it, smelled it. The\r\ndemonstration was complete and the cash would be forked over, a\r\ntwenty-barrel well bringing a hundred-barrel price! A smart widow near\r\nPithole sold her farm at treble its value because of “surface\r\nindications” she created by emptying a barrel of oil into a spring. The\r\nfarm proved good territory, much to the chagrin of the widow, who\r\nroundly abused the purchasers for “cheatin’ a poor lone woman!” Selling\r\nstock in companies that held lands, or interests in wells to be drilled\r\n“near big gushers”—they might be eight or ten miles off—was not\r\ninfrequent. On the other hand, a very slight risk often brought an\r\nimmense return. Parties would pay five-hundred dollars for the refusal\r\nof a tract of land and arrange with other parties to sink a well for a\r\nsmall lease on the property. If the well succeeded, one acre would pay\r\nthe cost of the entire farm; if it failed, the holders of the option\r\nforfeited the trifle that secured it and threw up the contract. It was\r\nrisking five-hundred dollars on the chance, not always very remote, of\r\ngaining a half-million.\r\n\r\nSometimes the craze to invest bordered upon the ludicrous. Sixteenths\r\nand fractions of sixteenths in producing, non-producing, drilling,\r\nundrilled and never-to-be-drilled wells “went like hot cakes” at two to\r\ntwenty-thousand dollars. A newcomer, in his haste to “tie onto\r\nsomething,” shelled out one-thousand dollars for a share in a gusher\r\nthat netted him two quarts of oil a day! Another cheerfully paid\r\nfifteen-thousand for the sixteenth of a flowing well which discounted\r\nthe Irishman’s flea—“you put your finger on the varmint and he wasn’t\r\nthere”—by balking that night and declining ever to start again! At a\r\nfire in 1866 water from a spring, dashed on the blaze, added fuel to the\r\nflames. An examination showed that oil was filling the spring and\r\nwater-wells in the neighborhood. From the well in Mrs. Reichart’s yard\r\nthe wooden pump brought fifty barrels of pure oil. L. L. Hill’s well and\r\nholes dug eight or ten feet had the same complaint. Excitement blew off\r\nat the top gauge. The _Record_ devoted columns to the new departure. Was\r\nthe oil so impatient to enrich Pitholians that, refusing to wait for the\r\ndrill to provide an outlet, it burst through the rocks in its eagerness\r\nto boom the district? Patches of ground the size of a quilt sold for\r\ntwo, three or four-hundred dollars and rows of pits resembling open\r\ngraves decorated the slope. In a week a digger discovered that a break\r\nin the pipe-line supplied the oil. The leak was repaired, the pits dried\r\nup, the water-wells resumed their normal condition and the fiasco ended\r\nignominiously. It was a modern version of the mountain that set the\r\ncountry by the ears to bring forth a mouse.\r\n\r\nJoseph Wood, proprietor of the St. James Hotel at Paterson, N.J., died\r\non May thirteenth, 1896. He was a wit and story-teller of the best kind,\r\na gallant fighter for the Union and for a year lived at Pithole. A\r\nfortune made by operating and speculation he lost by fire in a year. He\r\nconducted hotels at Hot Springs, Washington, Chicago and Milwaukee and\r\nwas one of the famous Bonifaces of the United States. On his\r\nbusiness-cards he printed these “religious beliefs:”\r\n\r\n“Do not keep the alabaster-boxes of your love and tenderness sealed up\r\nuntil your friends are dead. Fill their lives with sweetness. Speak\r\napproving, cheering words while their ears can hear them and while their\r\nhearts can be thrilled and made happier by them. The kind things you\r\nmean to say when they are gone say before they go. The flowers you mean\r\nto send to their coffins send to brighten and sweeten their homes before\r\nthey leave them. If my friends have alabaster-boxes laid away, full of\r\nfragrant perfumes of sympathy and affection, which they intend to break\r\nover my dead body, I would rather they would bring them out in my weary\r\nand troubled hours and open them, that I may be refreshed and cheered by\r\nthem while I need them. I would rather have a plain coffin without a\r\nflower, a funeral without a eulogy, than a life without the sweetness of\r\nlove and sympathy. Let us learn to anoint our friends beforehand for\r\ntheir burial. Post-mortem kindness does not cheer the burdened spirit.\r\nFlowers on the coffin cast no fragrance backward over the weary way.”\r\n\r\nLet down the bars and enter the field that was once the seething,\r\nboiling caldron called Pithole. A poplar-tree thirty feet high grows in\r\nthe cellar of the National Hotel. Stones and underbrush cover the site\r\nof the Metropolitan Theater and Murphy’s Varieties. This bit of sunken\r\nground, clogged with weeds and brambles, marks the Chase House. Here was\r\nMain street, where millions of dollars changed hands daily. For years\r\nthe Presbyterian church stood forsaken, the bell in the tower silent,\r\nthe pews untouched and the pulpit-Bible lying on the preacher’s desk.\r\nJohn McPherson’s store and Dr. Christie’s house were about the last\r\nbuildings in the place. Not a human-being now lives on the spot. All the\r\nold-timers moved away. All? No, a score or two quietly sleep among the\r\nbushes and briars that run riot over the little graveyard in which they\r\nwere laid when the dead city was in the throes of a tremendous\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n         The rate at which towns rose was surely most terrific\r\n         Nothing to rival it from Maine to the Pacific;\r\n         The rate at which they fell has never had an equal—\r\n         Woods, city, ruin’d waste—the story and the sequel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN GALLOWAY.]\r\n\r\nPithole was the Mecca of a legion of operators whose history is part and\r\nparcel of the oil-development. Phillips Brothers, giants on Oil Creek,\r\nbought farms and drilled extensively. Frederic Prentice and W. W. Clark,\r\nwho figured in two-thirds of the largest transactions from Petroleum\r\nCentre to Franklin, held a full hand. Frank W. Andrews, John\r\nSatterfield, J. R. Johnson, J. B. Fink, A. J. Keenan—the first\r\nburgess—D. H. Burtis, Heman Janes, “Pap” Sheakley, L. H. Smith and\r\nhundreds of similar caliber were on deck. John Galloway, known in every\r\noil-district of Pennsylvania and West Virginia as a tireless hustler,\r\ndid not let Pithole slip past unnoticed. He has been an operator in all\r\nthe fields since his first appearance on Oil Creek in the fall of 1861.\r\nSharing in the prosperity and adversity of the oil-regions, he has never\r\nbeen hoodooed or bankrupted. His word is his bond and his promise to pay\r\nhas always meant one-hundred cents on the dollar. More largely\r\ninterested in producing than ever, he attends to business at Pittsburg\r\nand lives at Jamestown, happy in his deserved success, in the love of\r\nhis family and the esteem of countless friends. Mr. Galloway’s\r\npedestrian feats would have crowned him with olive-wreaths at the\r\nOlympic games. Deerfoot could hardly have kept up with him on a\r\ntwenty-mile tramp to see an important well or hit a farmer for a lease\r\nbefore breakfast. He’s a good one!\r\n\r\nThe Swordsman’s Club attained the highest reputation as a social\r\norganization. One night in 1866, when Pithole was at the zenith of its\r\nfame, John Satterfield, Seth Crittenden, Alfred W. Smiley, John\r\nMcDonald, George Burchill, George Gilmore, Pard B. Smith, L. H. Smith,\r\nW. H. Longwell and other congenial gentlemen met for an evening’s\r\nenjoyment. The conversation turned upon clubs. Smiley jumped to his feet\r\nand moved that “we organize a club.” All assented heartily and the\r\nSwordman’s Club was organized there and then, with Pard B. Smith as\r\npresident and George Burchill as secretary. Elegant rooms were fitted\r\nup, the famous motto of “R. C. T.” was adopted and the club gave a\r\nseries of most elaborate “promenade-concerts and balls” in 1866-7.\r\nInvitations to these brilliant affairs were courted by the best people\r\nof Oildom. The club dissolved in 1868. Its membership included four\r\ncongressmen, two ex-governors wore its badge and scores of men\r\nconspicuous in the state and nation had the honor of belonging to the\r\nSwordman’s. At regular meetings “the feast of reason and the flow of\r\nsoul” blended merrily with the flowing bowl. Sallies of bright wit,\r\nspontaneous and never hanging fire, were promptly on schedule time. Good\r\nfellowship prevailed and C. C. Leonard immortalized the club in his\r\nside-splitting “History of Pithole.” Verily the years slip by. Long ago\r\nthe ephemeral town went back to its original pasture, long ago the\r\nfacetious historian went back to dust, long ago many a good clubman’s\r\nsword turned into rust. Pard B. Smith runs a livery in Cleveland,\r\nLongwell is in Oil City, Smiley—he represented Clarion county twice in\r\nthe Legislature—manages the pipe-line at Foxburg, L. H. Smith is in New\r\nYork and others are scattered or dead. On November twenty-first, 1890,\r\nthe “Pioneers of Pithole”—among them a number of Swordsmen—had a reunion\r\nand banquet at the Hotel Brunswick, Titusville. These stanzas, composed\r\nand sung by President Smith and “Alf” Smiley, were vociferously cheered:\r\n\r\n              “’Twas side by side, as Swordsmen true,\r\n                  In Pithole long ago,\r\n              We met the boys on common ground\r\n                  And gave them all a show.\r\n              In social as in business ways\r\n                  Our honor was our law,\r\n              And when a brother lost his grip\r\n                  He on the boys could draw.\r\n\r\n              CHORUS: “We’re the boys, the same old boys,\r\n                Who were there in sixty-five;\r\n              If any Swordsman comes our way\r\n                He’ll find us still alive.\r\n\r\n              “What if grim age creeps on apace,\r\n                  Our souls will ne’er grow old;\r\n              We will, as in the Pithole days,\r\n                  Stand true as Swordsmen bold.\r\n              In those old days we had our fun,\r\n                  But stood for honor true;\r\n              Here, warmly clasping hand-to-hand,\r\n                  Our friendship we renew.”\r\n\r\n“Spirits” inspired four good wells at Pithole. One dry hole, a mile\r\nsouth-east of town, seriously depressed stock in their skill as\r\n“oil-smellers.” An enthusiastic disciple of the Fox sisters, assured of\r\n“a big well,” drilled two-hundred feet below the sixth sand in search of\r\noil-bearing rock. He drilled himself into debt and Sheriff C. S.\r\nMark—six feet high and correspondingly broad—whom nobody could mistake\r\nfor an ethereal being, sold the outfit at junk-prices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALFRED W. SMILEY.]\r\n\r\nIn the swish and swirl of Pithole teamsters—a man with two stout horses\r\ncould earn twenty dollars a day clear—drillers and pumpers played no\r\nmean part. They received high wages and spent money freely.\r\nVariety-shows, music-halls—with “pretty waiter-girls”—dance-houses,\r\nsaloons, gambling-hells and dens of vice afforded unlimited\r\nopportunities to squander cash and decency and self-respect. Many a\r\nclever youth, flushed with the idea of “sowing his wild oats,”\r\nsacrificed health and character on the altars of Bacchus and Venus. Many\r\na comely maiden, yielding to the wiles of the betrayer, rounded up in\r\nthe brothel and the potter’s field. Many a pious mother, weeping for the\r\nwayward prodigal who was draining her life-blood, had reason to inquire:\r\n“Oh, where is my boy to-night?” Many a husband, forgetting the trusting\r\nwife and children at home, wandered from the straight path and tasted\r\nthe forbidden fruit. Many a promising life was blighted, many a hopeful\r\ncareer blasted, many a reputation smirched and many a fond heart broken\r\nby the pitfalls and temptations of Pithole. Dollars were not the only\r\nstakes in the exciting game of life—good names, family ties, bright\r\nprospects, domestic happiness and human souls were often risked and\r\noften lost. “The half has never been told.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOVERNOR SHEAKLEY.]\r\n\r\nScarcely less noted was the organization heralded far and wide as\r\n“Pithole’s Forty Thieves.” Well-superintendents, controlling the\r\ninterests of outside companies, were important personages. Distant\r\nstockholders, unable to understand the difficulties and uncertainties\r\nattending developments, blamed the superintendents for the lack of\r\ndividends. No class of men in the country discharged their duties more\r\nfaithfully, yet cranky investors in wildcat stocks termed them “slick\r\nrascals,” “plunderers” and “robbers.” Some joker suggested that once a\r\nband of Arabian Knights—fellows who stole everything—associated as “The\r\nForty Thieves” and that the libeled superintendents ought to organize a\r\nclub. The idea captured the town and “Pithole’s Forty Thieves” became at\r\nonce a tangible reality. Merchants, producers, capitalists and\r\nbusiness-men hastened to enroll themselves as members. Hon. James\r\nSheakley, of Mercer, was elected president. Social meetings were held\r\nregularly and guying greenhorns, who supposed stealing to be the object\r\nof the organization, was a favorite pastime. The practical pranks of the\r\n“Forty” were laughed at and relished in the whole region. Nine-tenths of\r\nthe members were young men, honorable in every relation of life, to whom\r\nthe organization was a genuine joke. They enjoyed its notoriety and\r\ndelighted to gull innocents who imagined they would purloin engines,\r\nderricks, drilling-tools, saw-mills and oil-tanks. Ten years after the\r\nband disbanded its president served in Congress and was a leading\r\ndebater on the Hayes-Tilden muddle. “Pap” Sheakley—as the boys\r\naffectionately called him—was the embodiment of integrity, kindliness\r\nand hospitality. He operated in the Butler field and lived at\r\nGreenville. Bereft of his devoted wife and lovely daughters by “the fell\r\nsergeant, Death,” he sold his, desolated home and accepted from\r\nPresident Cleveland the governorship of Uncle Sam’s remotest Territory.\r\nHis administration was so satisfactory that President Harrison\r\nreappointed him. There was no squarer, truer, nobler man in the public\r\nservice than James Sheakley, Ex-Governor of Alaska.\r\n\r\nRev. S. D. Steadman, the first pastor at Pithole, a zealous\r\nMethodist—was universally respected for earnestness and piety. The\r\n“forty thieves” sent him one-hundred-and-fifty dollars at Christmas of\r\n1866, with a letter commending his moral teachings, his courtesy and\r\ncharity. Another minister inquired of a Swordsman what the letters of\r\nthe club’s motto—“R. C. T.”—signified, “Religious Councils Treasured”\r\nwas the ready response. This raised the club immensely in the divine’s\r\nestimation and led to a sermon in which he extolled the jolly\r\norganization! He “took a tumble” when a deacon smilingly informed him\r\nthat the letters—a fake proposed in sport—symbolized “Rum, Cards,\r\nTobacco.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN INVOLUNTARY MUD-BATH.]\r\n\r\nMud was responsible for the funniest—to the spectators—mishap that ever\r\nconvulsed a Pithole audience. A group of us stood in front of the\r\nDanforth House at the height of the miry season. Thin mud overflowed the\r\nplank-crossing and a grocer laid short pieces of scantling two or three\r\nfeet apart for pedestrians to step on. A flashy sport, attired in a\r\nswell suit and a shiny beaver, was the first to take advantage of the\r\nimprovised passage. Half-way across the scantling to which he was\r\nstepping moved ahead of his foot. In trying to recover his balance the\r\nsport careened to one side, his hat flew off and he landed plump on his\r\nback, in mud and water three feet deep! He disappeared beneath the\r\nsurface as completely as though dropped into the sea, his head emerging\r\na moment later. Blinded, sputtering and gasping for breath, he was a\r\nsight for the gods and little fishes! Mouth, eyes, nose and ears were\r\nchoked with the dreadful ooze. Two men went to his assistance, led him\r\nto the rear of the hotel and turned the hose on him. His clothes were\r\nruined, his gold watch was never recovered and for weeks small boys\r\nwould howl: “His name is Mud!”\r\n\r\nJohn Galloway, on one of his rambles for territory, ate dinner at the\r\nhumble cabin of a poor settler. A fowl, tough, aged and peculiar, was\r\nthe principal dish. In two weeks the tourist was that way again. A boy\r\nof four summers played at the door, close to which the visitor sat down.\r\nA brood of small chickens approached the entrance. “Poo’, ittey sings,”\r\nlisped the child, “oo mus’ yun away; here’s ’e yasty man ’at eated up\r\noos mammy.” The good woman of the shanty had stewed the clucking-hen to\r\nfeed the unexpected guest.\r\n\r\nA maiden of uncertain age owned a farm which various operators vainly\r\ntried to lease. Hoping to steal a march on the others, one smooth talker\r\ncalled the second time. “I have come, Miss Blank,” he began, “to make\r\nyou an offer.” He didn’t get a chance to add “for your land.” The old\r\ngirl, not a gosling who would let a prize slip, jumped from her chair,\r\nclasped him about the neck and exclaimed: “Oh! Mr. Blank, this is so\r\nsudden, but I’m yours!” The astounded oilman shook her off at last and\r\nexplained that he already had a wife and five children and wanted the\r\nFarm only. The clinging vine wept and stormed, threatened a\r\nbreach-of-promise suit and loaded her dead father’s blunderbuss to be\r\nprepared for the next intruder.\r\n\r\nW. J. Bostford, who died at Jamestown in November of 1895, operated at\r\nPithole in its palmy days. Business was done on a cash basis and\r\noil-property was paid for in money up to hundreds-of-thousands of\r\ndollars. Bostford made a big sale and started from Pithole to deposit\r\nhis money. A cross-country trip was necessary to reach Titusville.\r\nShortly after leaving Pithole he was attacked by robbers, who took all\r\nthe money and left him for dead upon the highway. He was picked up\r\nalive, with a broken head and many other injuries, which he survived\r\nthirty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DINNER HOUR AT WIGGINS’S HOTEL.]\r\n\r\nThe first “hotel” at Pithole—a balloon-frame rushed up in a day—bore the\r\npretentious title of Astor House. Before its erection pilgrims to the\r\ncoming city took their chance of meals at the Holmden farm-house. As a\r\nguest wittily remarked: “It was table d’hote for men and also table\r\nd’oat for horses.” The viands were all heaped upon large dishes and\r\neverybody helped himself. The Morey-Farm Hotel, just above Pithole,\r\ncharged twenty-one dollars a week for board, had gas-light, steam-heat,\r\ntelegraph-office, barber-shop, colored waiters and “spring-mattresses.”\r\nIts cooking rivalled the best in the large cities. At Wiggins’s Hotel, a\r\nthree-story boarding-house in the Tidioute field, two-hundred men would\r\noften wait their turn to get dinner. This was a common experience in the\r\nfrontier towns, to which big throngs hurried before houses could be\r\nerected for their accommodation. E. H. Crittenden’s hotel at Titusville\r\nwas the finest Oildom boasted in the sixties. Book & Frisbee’s was\r\nnotable at the height of the Parker development. A dollar for a meal or\r\na bed, four dollars a day or twenty-eight dollars a week, be the stay\r\nlong or short, was the invariable rate. Peter Christie’s Central Hotel,\r\nat Petrolia, was immensely popular and a regular gold-mine for the\r\nowner. Oil City’s Petroleum House was a model hostelry, under “Charley”\r\nStaats and “Jim” White. The Jones House cleared Jones forty-thousand\r\ndollars in nine months. Its first guest was a Mr. Seymour, who spent one\r\nyear collecting data for a statistical work on petroleum. His\r\nmanuscripts perished in the flood of 1865. The last glimpse my eyes\r\nbeheld of Jones was at Tarport, where he was driving a dray. Bradford’s\r\nRiddell House and St. James Hotel both sized up to the most exacting\r\nrequirements. Good hotels and good restaurants were seldom far behind\r\nthe triumphant march of the pioneers whose successes established\r\noil-towns.\r\n\r\nCol. Gardner, “a big man any way you take him,” was Chief-of-Police at\r\nPithole. He has operated at Bradford and Warren, toyed with politics and\r\nmilitary affairs and won the regard of troops of friends. Charles H.\r\nDuncan, of Oil City—his youthful appearance suggests Ponce de Leon’s\r\nspring—served in the borough-council, of which James M. Guffey, the\r\nastute Democratic leader and successful producer, was clerk. Col. Morton\r\narrived in August of 1865 with a carpet-bag of job-type. His first\r\nwork—tickets for passage over Little Pithole Creek—the first printing\r\never done at Pithole, was never paid for. The town had shoals of trusty,\r\ngenerous fellows—“God’s own white boys,“ Fred Wheeler dubbed them—whose\r\nmanliness and enterprise and liberality were always above par.\r\n\r\nWhen men went crazy at Pithole and outsiders thought the oil-country was\r\n“flowing with milk and honey” and greenbacks, a party of wags thought to\r\nput up a little joke at the expense of a new-comer from Boston. They\r\narranged with the landlord for some coupon-bonds to use in the\r\ndining-room of the hotel and to seat the youth at their table. The\r\nNew-Englander was seated in due course. The guests talked of oil-lands,\r\nfabulous strikes and big fortunes as ordinary affairs. Each chucked\r\nunder his chin a five-twenty government-bond as a napkin. One lay in\r\nfront of the Bostonian’s plate, folded and creased like a genuine\r\nlinen-wiper. Calmly taking the “paper” from its receptacle, the chap\r\nfrom The Hub wiped his brow and adjusted the valuable napkin over his\r\nshirt-bosom. A moment later he beckoned to a servant and said: “See\r\nhere, waiter, this napkin is too small; bring me a dish of soup and a\r\n‘ten-forty.’” The jokers could not stand this. A laugh went around the\r\nfestive board that could have been heard at the Twin Wells and the\r\nmatter was explained to the bean-eater. He was put on the trail of “a\r\nsoft snap” and went home in a month with ten-thousand dollars. “Bring me\r\na ten-forty” circulated for a twelve-month in cigar-shops and bar-rooms.\r\n\r\nBen Hogan was one of the motley crew that swarmed to Pithole “broke.” He\r\ntaught sparring and gave exhibitions of strength at Diefenbach’s\r\nvariety-hall. He fought Jack Holliday for a purse of six-hundred dollars\r\nand defeated him in seven rounds. Four-hundred tough men and tougher\r\nwomen were present, many of them armed. Hogan was assured before the\r\nfight he would be killed if he whipped his opponent. He was shot at by\r\nMarsh Elliott during the mill, but escaped unhurt. Ben met Elliott soon\r\nthereafter and knocked him out in four brief rounds, breaking his nose\r\nand using him up generally. Next he opened a palatial sporting-house,\r\nthe receipts of which often reached a thousand dollars a day. An\r\nadventure of importance was with “Stonehouse Jack.” This desperado and\r\nhis gang had a grudge against Hogan and concocted a scheme to kill him.\r\nJack was to arrange a fight with Ben, during which Hogan was to be\r\nkilled by the crowd. Ben saw his enemy coming out of a dance-house and\r\nblazed away at him, but without effect. The fusillade scared\r\n“Stonehouse” away from Pithole and on January twenty-second, 1866, a\r\nvigilance committee at Titusville drove the villain out of the\r\noil-region, threatening to hang him or any of his gang who dared return.\r\nThis committee was organized to clear out a nest of incendiaries and\r\nthugs. The vigilants erected a gallows near the smoking embers of E. B.\r\nChase & Co.’s general store, fired the preceding night, and decreed the\r\nbanishment of hordes of toughs. “Stonehouse Jack” and one-hundred other\r\nmen, with a number of vile women came under this sentence. The whole\r\nparty was formed in line in front of the gallows, the “Rogue’s March”\r\nwas played and the procession, followed by a great crowd of people,\r\nproceeded to the Oil-Creek Railroad station. The prisoners were ordered\r\non board a special train, with a warning that if they ever again set\r\nfoot upon the soil of Titusville they would be summarily executed. This\r\nsalutary action ended organized crime in the oil-region.\r\n\r\nNorth of Pithole the tide crossed into Allegheny township. Balltown, a\r\nmeadow on C. M. Ball’s farm in July, 1865, at the end of the year\r\nparaded stores, hotels, a hundred dwellings and a thousand people. Fires\r\nin 1866 scorched it and waning production did the rest. Dawson Centre,\r\non the Sawyer tract, budded, frosted and perished. The Morey House, on\r\nthe Copeland farm, was the oasis in the desert, serving meals that\r\ntickled the midriff and might cope with Delmonico’s. Farms on Little\r\nPithole Creek were riddled without swelling the yield of crude\r\nimmoderately. Where are those oil-wells now? Echo murmurs “where?” In\r\nall that section of Cornplanter and Allegheny townships a derrick, an\r\nengine-house or a tank would be a novelty of the rarest breed.\r\n\r\nEight miles north-east of Titusville, where Godfrey Hill drilled a\r\ndry-hole in 1860 and two companies drilled six later, the Colorado\r\ndistrict finally rewarded gritty operators. Enterprise was benefited by\r\nsmall wells in the vicinity. Down Pithole Creek to its junction with the\r\nAllegheny the country was punctured. Oleopolis straggled over the slope\r\non the river’s bank, a pipe-line, a railroad to Pithole and minor wells\r\ncontributing to its support. The first well tackled a vein of natural\r\ngas, which caught fire and consumed the rig. The driller was alone, the\r\nowner of the well having gone into the shanty. In a twinkling flames\r\nenveloped the astonished knight of the temper-screw, who leaped from the\r\nderrick, clothes blazing and hair singed off, and headed for the water.\r\n“Boss,” he roared in his flight, “jump into the river and say your\r\nprayers quick! I’ve bu’sted the bung and hell’s running out.”\r\n\r\n“Breathe through the nostrils” is good advice. People should breathe\r\nthrough the nose and not use it so much for talking and singing through.\r\nYet every rule has exceptions. A pair of mules hauled oil from Dawson\r\nCentre in the flush times of the excitement. The mud was practically\r\nbottomless. A visitor was overheard telling a friend that the bodies of\r\nthe mules sank out of sight and that they were breathing through their\r\nears, which alone projected above the ooze. Dawson and many more\r\ndeparted oil-towns suggest the jingle:\r\n\r\n              “There was an old woman lived under a hill;\r\n              If she hadn’t moved she’d be there still:\r\n                          But she moved!”\r\n\r\nAbout St. Valentine’s Day in 1866, when the burning of the Tremont House\r\nled to the discovery of oil in springs and wells, was a hilarious time\r\nat Pithole. Every cellar was fairly flooded with grease. People pumped\r\nit from common pumps, dipped it from streams, tasted it in tea, inhaled\r\nit from coffee-pots and were afraid to carry lights at night lest the\r\nvery air should cause explosion and other unhappiness. It became a\r\nserious question what to drink. The whiskey could not be watered—there\r\nwas no water. Dirty shirts could not be washed—the very rain was crude\r\noil. Dirt fastened upon the damask cheeks of Pithole damsels and found\r\nan abiding-place in the whiskers of every bronzed fortune-hunter. Water\r\ncommanded an enormous price and intoxicating beverages were cheap, since\r\nthey could scarcely be taken in the raw. The editor of the _Record_, a\r\nstrict temperance man, was obliged to travel fourteen miles every\r\nmorning by stone-boat to get his glass of water. Stocks of oil-companies\r\nwere the only thing in the community thoroughly watered. Tramps, hobos,\r\nwandering vagrants and unwashed disbelievers that “cleanliness is next\r\nto Godliness” pronounced Pithole a terrestrial paradise. They were\r\nwilling to reverse Muhlenburg’s sentiment and “live alway” in that kind\r\nof dry territory.\r\n\r\n“You’re not fit to sit with decent people; come up here and sit along\r\nwith me!” thundered a Dawson teacher who sat at his desk hearing a\r\nrecitation, as he discovered at a glance the worst boy in school\r\nannoying his seatmate.\r\n\r\nCharles Highberger, who had lost a leg, was elected a justice of the\r\npeace at Pithole in 1866. Attorney Ruth, who came from Westmoreland\r\ncounty, was urging the conviction of a miserable whelp when he noticed\r\nHighberger had fallen asleep, as was his custom during long arguments.\r\nMr. Ruth aroused him and remarked: “I wish your honor would pay\r\nattention to the points which I am about to make, as they have an\r\nimportant bearing on the case.” Highberger opened his eyes, glared\r\naround the room and rose on his crutches in great wrath, exclaiming:\r\n“There has been too much blamed chin-whacking in this case; you have\r\nbeen talking two hours and I haven’t seen a cent of costs. The prisoner\r\nmay consider himself discharged. The court will adjourn to Andy\r\nChristy’s drug-store.” This was the way justice was dispensed with in\r\nthose good old days when “go as you please” was the rule at Pithole.\r\n\r\nJohn G. Saxe once lectured at Pithole and was so pleased with the people\r\nand place that he donated twenty-five dollars to the charity-fund and\r\nwrote columns of descriptive matter to a Boston newspaper. “If I were\r\nnot Alexander I would be Diogenes,” said the Macedonian conqueror.\r\nSimilarly Henry Ward Beecher remarked, when he visited Oil City to\r\nlecture, “If I were not pastor of Plymouth church I would be pastor of\r\nan Oil-City church.” The train conveying Dom Pedro, Emperor of Brazil,\r\nthrough the oil-region stopped at Foxburg to afford the imperial guest\r\nan opportunity to see an oil-well torpedoed. He watched the filling of\r\nthe shell with manifest interest, dropped the weight after the torpedo\r\nhad been lowered and clapped his hands when a column of oil rose in the\r\nair. An irreverent spectator whispered: “This beats playing pedro.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. P. ALBEE.]\r\n\r\nJ. P. Albee, laborer, painter, carpenter, rig-builder, pumper,\r\npipe-liner, merchant and insurance-agent, was born in Warren county,\r\nreared on a farm in the Wisconsin lead-mining regions, enlisted in 1861,\r\nserved three years gallantly and was discharged because of a wound in\r\nthe breast by a rifle-ball. He struck Pithole in September of 1865,\r\nshared in the ups and downs of the transitory excitement and was one of\r\nthe founders, if not the full-fledged father, of Cash-Up. The brave\r\nveteran was a pioneer in shoving ahead and demonstrating where oil was\r\n_not_ to be expected. He owned fourteen dry-holes in whole or part, a\r\nnumber sufficient to establish quite a record. Drifting to Butler with\r\nthe tide of developments, he engaged in various pursuits with varying\r\nsuccess. Hosts of friends relish his tales of army-life and of ventures\r\nin Oildom, a knapsack of which he has constantly on hand. The years\r\nspeed quickly, bringing many changes in their wake, and thousands who\r\nonce waded through the muddy streets of Pithole are now treading the\r\ngolden pavements of the Celestial City. Those who linger here a while\r\nlonger love to recall the times that can never be repeated under the\r\nblue canopy.\r\n\r\nMud-veins in the third sand on Oil Creek and at Pithole would often\r\nstick the tools effectually. On Bull Run three wells in one derrick were\r\nabandoned with tools stuck in the third sand. The theory was that the\r\nmud vein was a stratum of slate in the sand, which became softened and\r\nran into the well when water came in contact with it. Casing has robbed\r\nit of its terrors.\r\n\r\nBefore casing was introduced it was often difficult to tell if oil was\r\nfound. Oilmen would examine the sand, look for “soot” on the\r\nsand-pumpings and place a lighted match to the sand-pump immediately\r\nafter it was drawn from the well, as a test for gas. If the driller was\r\nsure the drill dropped two or three feet, with “soot” on the\r\nsand-pumpings, the show was considered worth testing. A seed-bag was put\r\non the tubing and the well was allowed to stand a day or two to let the\r\nseed swell. To exhaust the water sometimes required weeks, but when all\r\nhope of a producer was lost and the last shovel of coal was in the\r\nboiler the oil might come. There seemed to be a virtue in that last\r\nshovel of coal. The shoemaker who could make a good seed-bag was a big\r\nman. The man who tied on the seed-bag for a well that proved a good\r\nproducer was in demand. If, after oil showed itself, flax-seed was seen\r\ncoming from the pipe the well-owner’s heart could be found in his boots.\r\nThe bag was burst, the water let in and the operator’s hopes let out.\r\n\r\nA young divine preached a sermon at Pithole, on the duty of\r\nself-consecration, so effectively that a hearer presented him with a\r\nbundle of stock in a company operating on the Hyner farm. The preacher\r\nsold his shares for ten-thousand dollars and promptly retired from the\r\npulpit to study law! Rev. S. D. Steadman, while a master of sarcasm that\r\nwould skewer a hypocrite on the point of irony, was particularly at home\r\nin the realm of the affections and of the ideal. In matters of the heart\r\nand soul few could with surer touch set aflow the founts of tender\r\npathos. He met his match occasionally. Rallying a friend on his\r\nCalvinism, he said, “I believe Christians may fall from grace.” “Brother\r\nSteadman,” was the quick rejoinder, “you need not argue that; the flock\r\nyou’re tending is convincing proof that the doctrine is true of your\r\nmembership.”\r\n\r\nA good deal of fun has been poked at the Georgia railroad which had\r\ncow-catchers at the rear, to keep cattle from walking into the cars, and\r\nstopped in the woods while the conductor went a mile for milk to\r\nreplenish a crying baby’s nursing-bottle. On my last trip to Pithole by\r\nrail there were no other passengers. The conductor sat beside me to chat\r\nof former days and the decadence of the town at the northern end of the\r\nline. Four miles from Oleopolis fields of wild strawberries “wasted\r\ntheir sweetness on the desert air.” In reply to my hint that the berries\r\nlooked very tempting, the conductor pulled the bell-rope and stopped the\r\ntrain. All hands feasted on the luscious fruit until satisfied.\r\nColeridge, who observed that “Doubtless the Almighty _could_ make a\r\nfiner fruit than the wild strawberry, but doubtless He never did,” would\r\nhave enjoyed the scene. “Don’t hurry too much,” the conductor called\r\nafter me at Pithole “we can start forty minutes behind time and I’ll\r\nwait for you!” The rails were taken up and the road abandoned in the\r\nfall, but the strawberry-picking is as fresh as though it happened\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\nLong ago teamsters would start from the mines with twenty bushels of\r\nfifteen-cent coal. By the time they reached Pithole it would swell to\r\nthirty-five bushels of sixty-cent coal. With oil for back-loading the\r\nteamsters made more money then than a bond-juggler with a cinch on the\r\nUnited-States treasury.\r\n\r\nA farmer’s wife near Dawson Centre, who had washed dishes for forty\r\nyears, became so tired of the monotony that, the day her husband leased\r\nthe farm for oil-purposes, she smashed every piece of crockery in the\r\nhouse and went out on the woodpile and laughed a full hour. It was the\r\nfirst vacation of her married life and dish-washing women will know how\r\nto sympathize with the poor soul in her drudgery and her emancipation.\r\n\r\nPithole, Shamburg, Red-Hot, Tip-Top, Cash-Up, Balltown and Oleopolis\r\nhave passed into history and many of their people have gone beyond the\r\nvale of this checkered pilgrimage, yet memories of these old times come\r\nback freighted with thoughts of joyous days that will return no more\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n       “Better be a young June-bug than an old bird of Paradise.”\r\n\r\n                           PITHOLE REVISITED.\r\n\r\nThe following lines, first contributed by me to the Oil-City _Times_ in\r\n1870, went the rounds twenty-five years ago:\r\n\r\n         Not a sound was heard, not a shrill whistle’s scream,\r\n             As our footsteps through Pithole we hurried;\r\n         Not a well was discharging an unctuous stream\r\n             Where the hopes of the oilmen lay buried!\r\n\r\n         We walk’d the dead city till far in the night—\r\n             Weeds growing where wheels once were turning—\r\n         While seeking to find by the struggling moonlight\r\n             Some symptom of gas dimly burning.\r\n\r\n         No useless regret should encumber man’s breast,\r\n             Though dry-holes and Pitholes may bound him;\r\n         So we lay like a warrior taking his rest,\r\n             Each with his big overcoat ’round him.\r\n\r\n         Few and short were the prayers we said,\r\n             We spoke not a sentence of sorrow,\r\n         But steadfastly gazed on the place that was dead\r\n             And bitterly long’d for the morrow!\r\n\r\n         We thought, as we lay on our primitive bed,\r\n             An old sand-pump reel for a pillow,\r\n         How friends, foes and strangers were heartily bled\r\n             And ruin swept on like a billow!\r\n\r\n         Lightly we slept, for we dreamt of the scamp,\r\n             And in fancy began to upbraid him,\r\n         Who swindled us out of our very last stamp—\r\n             In the grave we could gladly have laid him!\r\n\r\n         We rose half an hour in advance of the sun,\r\n             But little refreshed for retiring!\r\n         And, feeling as stiff as a son of a gun,\r\n             Set off on a hunt for some firing.\r\n\r\n         Slowly and sadly our hard-tack went down,\r\n             Then we wrote a brief sketch of our story\r\n         And struck a bee-line for Oil City’s fair town,\r\n             Leaving Pithole alone in its glory!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARKER OIL EXCHANGE IN 1874.]\r\n\r\nTOP ROW—\r\n  J.

HEYDRICK.]\r\n\r\nIn transforming the unfruitful, uninteresting Valley of Oil Creek into\r\nthe rich, attractive Valley of Petroleum the course of developments was\r\nsouthward from the Drake well. Although some persons imagined that a\r\npool or a strip bordering the stream would be the limit of successful\r\noperations, others entertained broader ideas and believed the\r\npetroleum-sun was not doomed to rise and set on Oil Creek. The Evans\r\nwell at Franklin confirmed this view. Naturally the Allegheny River was\r\nregarded with favor as the base of further experiments. Quite as\r\nnaturally the town at the junction of the river and the creek was\r\nbenefited. The Michigan Rock-Oil-Company laid out building-lots and Oil\r\nCity grew rapidly in wealth, ambition, enterprise and population. From a\r\nhalf-dozen dwellings, two unbridged streams, the remnants of an\r\niron-furnace and a patch of cleared land on the flats it speedily\r\nadvanced to a hustling settlement of five-thousand souls, “out for the\r\nstuff” and all eager for profit. Across the Allegheny, on the Downing\r\nand Bastian farms, William L. Lay laid out the village of Laytonia in\r\n1863 and improved the ferriage. Phillips & Vanausdall, who struck a\r\nthirty-barrel well on the Downing farm in 1861, established a ferry\r\nabove Bastian’s and started the suburbs of Albion and Downington. In\r\n1865 these were merged into Imperial City, which in 1866 was united with\r\nLaytonia and Leetown to form Venango City. In 1871 the boroughs of\r\nVenango City and Oil City were incorporated as the city of Oil City,\r\nwith William M. Williams as mayor. Three passenger-bridges, one railroad\r\nbridge and an electric street-railway connect the north and south sides\r\nof the “Hub of Oildom.” Beautiful homes, first-class schools and\r\nchurches, spacious business-blocks, paved streets, four railroads,\r\nelectric-lights, water-works, pipe-line offices, strong banks, enormous\r\ntube-works, huge refineries, bright newspapers, a paid fire-department,\r\nall the modern conveniences and twelve-thousand clever people make Oil\r\nCity one of the busiest and most desirable towns in or out of\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe largest of twenty-five or thirty wells drilled around Walnut Bend,\r\nsix miles up the river, in 1860-65, was rated at two-hundred barrels.\r\nFour miles farther, two miles north-east of the mouth of Pithole Creek,\r\nJohn Henry settled on the north bank of the river in 1802. Henry’s Bend\r\nperpetuates the name of this brave pioneer, who reared a large family\r\nand died in 1858. The farm opposite Henry’s, at the crown of the bend,\r\nHeydrick Brothers, of French Creek township, leased in the fall of 1859.\r\nJesse Heydrick organized the Wolverine Oil-Company, the second ever\r\nformed to drill for petroleum. Thirty shares of stock constituted its\r\ncapital of ten-thousand-five-hundred dollars. The first well,\r\none-hundred-and-sixty feet deep, pumped only ten barrels a day, giving\r\nWolverine shares a violent chill. The second, also sunk in 1860, at\r\nthree-hundred feet flowed fifteen-hundred barrels! Beside this giant the\r\nDrake well was a midget. The Allegheny had knocked out Oil Creek at a\r\nstroke, the production of the Heydrick spouter doubling that of all the\r\nothers in the region put together. It was impossible to tank the oil,\r\nwhich was run into a piece of low ground and formed a pond through which\r\nyawl-boats were rowed fifty rods! By this means seven-hundred barrels a\r\nday could be saved. At last the tubing was drawn, which decreased the\r\nyield and rendered pumping necessary. The well flowed and pumped about\r\none-hundred-thousand barrels, doing eighty a day in 1864-5, when the\r\noldest producer in Venango county. It was a celebrity in its time and\r\nproved immensely profitable. In December of 1862 Jesse Heydrick went to\r\nIrvine, forty miles up the river, to float down a cargo of empty\r\nbarrels. Twenty-five miles from Irvine, on the way back, the river was\r\nfrozen from bank to bank. He sawed a channel a mile, ran the barrels to\r\nthe well, filled them, loaded them in a flat-boat and arrived at\r\nPittsburg on a cold Saturday before Christmas. Oil was scarce, the\r\nzero-weather having prevented shipments, and he sold at thirteen dollars\r\na barrel. A thaw set in, the market was deluged with crude and in four\r\ndays the price dropped to two dollars! Stock-fluctuations had no\r\nbusiness in the game with petroleum.\r\n\r\nWolverine shares climbed out of sight. Mr. Heydrick bought the whole\r\nbatch, the lowest costing him four-thousand dollars and the highest\r\nfifteen-thousand. He sold part of his holdings on the basis of\r\nfifteen-hundred-thousand dollars for the well and farm of two-hundred\r\nacres, forty-three-thousand times the original value of the land!\r\nHeydrick Brothers bored seventy wells on three farms in President\r\ntownship, one of which cost eighteen months’ labor and ten-thousand\r\ndollars in money and produced nine barrels of oil. They disposed of it,\r\nthe new owner fussed with it and for five years received fifteen barrels\r\nof oil a day.\r\n\r\nAccidents and incidents resulting from the Wolverine operations would\r\nfill a dime-novel. Jesse Heydrick, organizer of the company, went east\r\nwith two or three-hundred-thousand dollars, presumably to “play Jesse”\r\nwith the bulls and bears of Wall Street. He returned in a year or more\r\ndestitute of cash, but loaded with entertaining tales of adventure. He\r\ntold a thrilling story of his abduction from a New-York wharf and\r\nshipment to Cuba by a band of kidnappers, who stole his money and\r\ntreated him harshly. He endured severe hardships and barely escaped with\r\nhis life and a mine of experience. Working his way north, he resumed\r\nsurveying, prepared valuable maps of the Butler field and was a standard\r\nauthority on oil-matters in the district. For years he was connected\r\nwith a pipe-line in Ohio, returning thence to Butler, his present\r\nresidence, to engage in oil-operations. Mr. Heydrick is cultured and\r\nsocial, brimful of information and interesting recitals, and not a\r\nbilious crank who thinks the world is growing worse because he lost a\r\nfortune. A brother at Franklin was president of the Oil-City Bank,\r\nincorporated in 1864 as a bank of issue and forced to the wall in 1866,\r\nand served a year on the Supreme Bench. James Heydrick was a skilled\r\nsurveyor and Charles W. resided at the old homestead on French Creek.\r\nHeydrick Brothers were “the Big Four” in developments that brought the\r\nAllegheny-River region into the petroleum-column. It is singular that\r\nthe Heydrick well, located at random thirty-seven years ago, was the\r\nlargest ever struck on the banks of the zig-zagged, ox-bowed stream.\r\n\r\n                It set the pace to serve as an example,\r\n                But not another could come up to sample.\r\n\r\nEight rods square on the Heydrick tract leased for five-thousand dollars\r\nand fifty per cent. of the oil, while the Wolverine shares attested the\r\nincreasing wealth of the oil-interest and the pitch to which oil-stocks\r\nmight rise. Hussey & McBride secured the Henry farm and obtained a large\r\nproduction in 1860-1. The Walnut Tree and Orchard wells headed the list.\r\nWarren & Brother pumped oil from Pithole to Henryville, a small town on\r\nthe flats, of whose houses, hotels, stores and shipping-platforms no\r\nscrap survives. The Commercial Oil-Company bought the Culbertson farm,\r\nabove Henry, and drilled extensively on Muskrat and Culbertson Runs.\r\nPatrick McCrea, the first settler on the river between Franklin and\r\nWarren, the first Allegheny ferryman north of Franklin and the first\r\nCatholic in Venango county, migrated from Virginia in 1797 to the wilds\r\nof North-western Pennsylvania. C. Curtiss purchased the McCrea tract of\r\nfour-hundred acres in 1861 and stocked it in the Eagle Oil-Company of\r\nPhiladelphia. Fair wells were found on the property and the town of\r\nEagle Rock attained the dignity of three-hundred buildings. An eagle\r\ncould fly away with all that is left of the town and the wells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWIN E. CLAPP.]\r\n\r\nFarther along Robert Elliott, who removed from Franklin, owned\r\none-thousand acres on the south side of the river and built the first\r\nmill in President township. Rev. Ralph Clapp built a blast-furnace in\r\n1854-5, a mile from the mouth of Hemlock Creek, at the junction of which\r\nwith the Allegheny a big hotel, a store and a shop are situated. Mr.\r\nClapp gained distinction in the pulpit and in business, served in the\r\nLegislature and died in 1865. His son, Edwin E. Clapp, had a block of\r\nsix-thousand acres, the biggest slice of undeveloped territory in\r\nOildom. Productive wells have been sunk on the river-front, but Clapp\r\ninvariably refused to sell or lease except once. To Kahle Brothers, for\r\nthe sake of his father’s friendship for their father, he leased\r\ntwo-hundred acres, on which many good wells are yielding nicely.\r\nPreferring to keep his own lands untouched until he “got good and\r\nready,” he operated largely at Tidioute, he and his brother, John M.\r\nClapp, acquiring great wealth. He was chairman of the Producers’ Council\r\nand active in the memorable movements of 1871-3. He built for his home\r\nthe President Hotel, furnishing it with every comfort and luxury except\r\nthe one no _bachelor_ can possess. From him Macadam, Talbot and\r\nNicholson could have learned much about road-making. At his own expense\r\nhe constructed many a mile of first-class roads in President, grading,\r\nditching and leveling in a fashion to make a bicycler’s mouth water.\r\nThere was not a scintilla of pride or affectation in his composition. It\r\nis told that an agent of the Standard Oil-Company appointed a time to\r\nmeet him “on important business.” The interview lasted two minutes.\r\n“What is the business?” interrogated Clapp. “Our company authorizes me\r\nto offer you one-million dollars for your lands in President and I am\r\nprepared to pay you the money.” “Anything else?” “No.” “Well, the land\r\nisn’t for sale; good-morning!” Off went Clapp as coolly as though he had\r\nmerely received a bid for a bushel of potatoes. Whether true or not, the\r\nstory is characteristic. As a friend to swear by, a helper of the poor,\r\na believer in fair-play, a prime joker and an inimitable weaver of comic\r\nyarns few could equal, none excel, the “President of President.” He died\r\nin July, 1897.\r\n\r\nAround Tionesta, the county-seat of Forest, numerous holes were punched.\r\nThomas Mills, who operated in Ohio and missed opening the Sistersville\r\nfield by a scratch, drilled in 1861-2. The late George S. Hunter—he\r\nbuilt Tionesta’s first bridge and ought to have a monument for\r\nenterprise—hunted earnestly for paying territory. Up Tionesta Creek\r\noperations extended slowly, but developments in 1882-3 atoned for the\r\ndelay. Then Forest county was “the cynosure of all eyes,” each week\r\nspringing fresh surprises. Balltown had a crop of dry-holes, followed by\r\nwells of all grades from twenty barrels to fifteen-hundred. At Henry’s\r\nMills and on the Cooper lands, north-east of Balltown and running into\r\nWarren county, spouters were decidedly in vogue. Reno No. 1 well,\r\nfinished in December of 1882, flowed twenty-eight-hundred barrels! Reno\r\nNo. 2, McCalmont Oil-Company’s No. 1, Patterson’s and the Anchor\r\nOil-Company’s No. 14 went over the fifteen-hundred mark. In the midst of\r\nthese gushers Melvin, Walker & Shannon’s duster indicated spotted\r\nterritory, uncertain as the verdict of a petit jury. The Forest splurge\r\nheld the entire oil-trade on the ragged edge for months. Every time one\r\nor more fellows took to the woods to manipulate a wildcat-well oil took\r\na tumble. Notwithstanding the magnitude of the business, with\r\nthirty-six-million barrels of oil in stock and untold millions of\r\ndollars invested, the report from Balltown or Cooper of a new strike\r\ncaused a bad break. Some owners of important wells worked them as\r\n“mysteries” to “milk the trade.” Derricks were boarded tightly, armed\r\nmen kept intruders from approaching too near and information was\r\nwithheld or falsified until the gang of manipulators “worked the\r\nmarket.” To offset this leading dealers employed “scouts,” whose mission\r\nwas to get correct news at all hazards. The duties of these trusty\r\nfellows involved great labor, night watches, incessant vigilance and\r\nsometimes personal danger. The “mystery” racket and the introduction of\r\n“scouts” were new elements in the business, necessitated by the peculiar\r\ntactics of a small clique whose methods were not always creditable. The\r\npassing of the Forest field, which declined with unprecedented rapidity,\r\npractically ended the system that had terrorized the oil-exchanges in\r\nNew York, Oil City, Bradford and Pittsburg. The collapse of the Cooper\r\npool was more unexpected than the striking of a gusher would be under\r\nany circumstances. Its influence upon oil-values was ridiculously\r\ndisproportionate to its merits, just as the tail sometimes wags the dog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE MIDDLE FIELD.]\r\n\r\nClosely allied to Balltown and Cooper in its principal features, its\r\ninjurious effects and sudden depreciation, was the field that taught the\r\nForest lesson. On May nineteenth, 1882, the oil-trade was paralyzed by\r\nthe report of a big well in Cherry-Grove township, Warren county, miles\r\nfrom previous developments. The general condition of the region was\r\nprosperous, with an advancing market and a favorable outlook. The new\r\nwell—the famous “646”—struck the country like a cyclone. Nobody had\r\nheard a whisper of the finding of oil in the hole George Dimick was\r\ndrilling near the border of Warren and Forest. The news that it was\r\nflowing twenty-five-hundred barrels flashed over the wires with\r\ndisastrous consequences. The excitement in the oil-exchanges, as the\r\nprice of certificates dropped thirty to fifty per cent. in a few\r\nmoments, was indescribable. Margins and small-fry holders were wiped out\r\nin a twinkling and the losses aggregated millions. It was a panic of the\r\nfirst water, far-reaching and ruinous. A plunge from one-thirty to\r\nfifty-five cents for crude meant distress and bankruptcy to thousands of\r\nproducers and persons carrying oil. Men comfortably off in the morning\r\nwere beggared by noon. Other wells speedily followed “646.” The Murphy,\r\nthe Mahoopany and scores more swelled the daily yield to thirty-thousand\r\nbarrels. Five-hundred wells were rushed down with the utmost celerity.\r\nBig companies bought lands at big prices and operated on a big scale.\r\nPipe-lines were laid, iron-tanks erected and houses reared by the\r\nhundred. Cherry Grove dwarfed the richest portions of the region into\r\ninsignificance. It bade fair to swamp the business, to flood the world\r\nwith cheap oil, to compel the abandonment of entire districts and to\r\ncrush the average operator. But if the rise of Cherry Grove was vividly\r\npicturesque, its fall was startlingly phenomenal. One dark December\r\nmorning the workmen noticed that the Forest Oil-Company’s largest gusher\r\nhad stopped flowing. Within a week the disease had spread like an\r\nepidemic. Spouters ceased to spout and obstinately declined to pump. The\r\nyield was counted by dozens of barrels instead of thousands. In January\r\none-fourth the wells were deserted and the machinery removed.\r\nThree-hundred wells on April first yielded hardly two-thousand barrels,\r\nthree-quarters what “646” or the Murphy had done alone! The suddenness\r\nof the topple cast Oil Creek into the shade and eclipsed Pithole itself.\r\nPiles of junk represented miles of pipe-lines and acres of tanks. The\r\nCooper fever was breaking out and, with Henry’s Mills and Balltown,\r\nrepeated in 1883 the hurrah of 1882. For eleven months the Forest-Warren\r\npools fretted and fumed, producing five-million barrels of oil and\r\nhaving the trade by the throat. In that brief period Cherry Grove came\r\nand went, Cooper threatened and subsided, and Balltown was bowled out.\r\nNine-tenths of the operators figured as heavy losers. Pennsylvania’s\r\nproduction shrank from ninety-thousand barrels to sixty-thousand and a\r\nhealthy reaction set in. Petroleum-developments often presented\r\nremarkable peculiarities, but the strangest of all was the readiness\r\nwith which speculators time and again fell a prey to the schemes of\r\nForest-Warren jobbers, whose “picture is turned to the wall.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. B. HUGHES.]\r\n\r\nThe professional “oil-scout” first became prominent at Cherry Grove. He\r\nwas neither an Indian fighter nor a Pinkerton detective, although\r\npossessing the courage and sharpness of both. He combined a knowledge of\r\nwoodcraft and human-nature with keen discernment, acute judgment and\r\ninfinite patience. S. B. Hughes, J. C. Tennent, P. C. Boyle, J. C.\r\nMcMullen, Frank H. Taylor, Joseph Cappeau, James Emery and J. H. Rathbun\r\nwere captains in the good work of worrying and circumventing the\r\n“mystery” men. Hughes rendered service that won the confidence of his\r\nemployers and brought him a competence. Never caught napping, for one\r\nspecial feat he was said to have received ten-thousand dollars. It was\r\nnot uncommon for him and his comrades to keep their boots on a week at a\r\nstretch, to snatch a nap under a tree or on a pile of casing, to creep\r\non all-fours inside the guard-lines and watch pale Luna wink merrily and\r\nthe bright stars twinkle while reclining on the damp ground to catch the\r\nfaintest sound from a mystified well. Boyle and Tennent made brilliant\r\nplays in the campaign of 1882-3. Captain J. T. Jones, failing to get\r\ncorrect information regarding “646,” lost heavily on long oil when the\r\nCherry-Grove gusher hypnotized the market and sent Tennent from Bradford\r\nto size up the wells and the movements of those manipulating them.\r\nMichael Murphy, learning that Grace & Dimick were quietly drilling a\r\nwildcat-well on lot 646, smelled a large-sized rodent and concluded to\r\nshare in the sport. For one-hundred dollars an acre and one-eighth the\r\nusufruct Horton, Crary & Co., the Sheffield tanners, sold him lot 619,\r\nnorth-east of 646. Murphy had cut his eye-teeth as an importer—John S.\r\nDavis was his partner—of oil-barrels, an exporter of crude and an\r\noperator at Bradford. He pushed a well on the south-west corner of his\r\npurchase and secured lands in the vicinity. Grace & Dimick held back\r\ntheir well a month to tie up lots and complete arrangements regarding\r\nthe market. Everything was managed adroitly. The trade had not a glimmer\r\nof suspicion that a bombshell might be fired at any moment. Murphy’s rig\r\nburned down on May fifteenth, he was in Washington trying to close a\r\ndeed for another tract and “646” was put through the sand. On June\r\nsecond Murphy’s No. 1, which he guarded strictly after rebuilding the\r\nrig, flowed sixteen-hundred barrels. His No. 2, finished on July third,\r\nflowed thirty-six-hundred barrels in twenty-four hours! The Mahoopany\r\nand a half-dozen others aided in the demoralization of prices. Murphy\r\nsold eighty acres of lot 619 for fifty-thousand dollars to the McCalmont\r\nOil-Company. The Anchor Oil-Company’s gusher on lot 647 caught fire,\r\nwithout curtailing the flow, and was burning furiously as “Jim” Tennent\r\narrived from Bradford. The scouts had their hands full, with the\r\n“white-sand pools” and the keenest masters of “mystery wells” to demand\r\ntheir best licks.\r\n\r\nWatching Murphy’s dry-hole on lot 633 was Tennent’s initial job. The\r\nWhale Oil-Company’s duster on lot 648 next claimed the attention of the\r\nscouts. It had been drilled below the sand-level and the tools left at\r\nthe bottom. On Sunday night, July ninth, 1882, Boyle, Tennent and two\r\ncompanions raised the tools by hand, measured the well with a steel-line\r\nand telegraphed their principals that it was dry. This report jumped the\r\nmarket on Monday morning from forty-nine cents to sixty. The Shannon\r\nwell on the Cooper tract needed constant care and the scouts divided the\r\nlabor. Tennent and Rathbun one night sought to crawl near the well. A\r\ntwig snapped off and a guard fired, the ball grazing “Jim’s” ear. In\r\nDecember Boyle and W. C. Edwards drilled Grandin No. 4 below the sand\r\nbefore the owners knew the rock had been reached. Its failure surprised\r\nthe trade as much as the success of “646.” Boyle actually posted the\r\nguards to keep intruders away and they refused to let W. W. Hague, an\r\nowner of the well, inside the line until the contractor appeared and\r\npermitted him to pass! Boyle and Tennent did fine work north of the\r\nCooper field. At the Shultz well Tennent, in order to make a quick trip\r\nof a half-mile to the pipe-line telegraph, clung to the tail of\r\nCappeau’s horse and kept up with the animal’s gallop. Mercury might not\r\nhave endorsed that style of locomotion, but it served the purpose and\r\ngot the news to Jones ahead of everybody else. Tennent played the market\r\nskillfully, cleared twenty-five-thousand dollars on Macksburg lands and\r\noperated with tolerable success in McKean county. Nine years ago he\r\nremoved to his thousand-acre prairie-farm in Kansas, the land of\r\nsockless statesman and nimble grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nBoyle, brimful of novel resources, puzzled the “mystery” chaps by his\r\nbold ingenuity and usually beat them at their own game. He squarely\r\novermatched the field-marshals of manipulation. His fertile brain\r\noriginated the plan of drilling Grandin No. 4 and other test wells. The\r\nnight he went to drill the Grace well through the sand he paid the\r\nferryman at Dunham’s Mills not to answer any calls until morning, thus\r\ncutting off all chance of pursuit and surprise. At the well Boyle wrote\r\nan order to deliver the well to Tennent, signing it Pickwick, and the\r\ndrillers retired to bed! Somebody had been there before them and poured\r\nback the sand-pumpings. At the Patterson well Boyle devised a code of\r\ntin-horn signals that outwitted the men inside the derrick and flashed\r\nthe result to Gusher City. The number of expedients continually devised\r\nwas a marvel. Thanks to the energy and ability of these tireless scouts,\r\nof whose midnight exploits, wild rides, hairbreadth escapes and queer\r\nadventures many pages could be written, the effect of “mysteries” was\r\nfrequently neutralized and at length the whole system of guarded wells,\r\nbull-dogs and shot-guns was eliminated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: P. M. SHANNON.]\r\n\r\nThe Forest-Warren white-sand pools marked a new era in developments,\r\nwith new ideas and new methods to hoodoo speculation. Cherry Grove had\r\nwilted from twenty-five-thousand barrels in September to three-thousand\r\nin December, when Cooper Hill loomed above the horizon and Balltown\r\nappeared on deck. Shallow wells had been sunk far up Tionesta Creek in\r\n1862-3. Near the two dwellings, saw-mill, school-house and barn dubbed\r\nFoxburg, the stamping-ground of deer-hunters and bark-peelers, Marcus\r\nHulings—his name is a synonym for successful wildcatting—in 1876 drilled\r\na well that smacked of oil. The derrick stood ten years and globules of\r\ngrease bubbled up from the depths, a thousand feet beneath. C. A.\r\nShultz, a piano-tuner, taking his cue from the Hulings well, interested\r\nFrederick Morck, a Warren jeweler, and leased the Fox estate and\r\ncontiguous lands in 1881. The Blue-Jay and two Darling wells, small\r\nproducers, created a ripple which dry-holes evaporated. They were on\r\nWarrant 2991, Howe township, known to fame as the Cooper tract,\r\nnorth-west of Foxburg. The conditions of the lease required a well at\r\nthe western end of the warrant. Cherry Grove was at its zenith, crude\r\nwas flirting with the fifties and operators considered the Blue-Jay\r\nchick a lean bird. J. Mainwaring leased one-hundred acres from Morck &\r\nShultz and built a rig at the head of a wild ravine, in the sunless\r\nwoodland, a half-mile from Tionesta Creek. He lost faith and the\r\nMainwaring lease and rig passed to P. M. Shannon, of Bradford. Born in\r\nClarion county, Philip Martin Shannon enlisted at fourteen, served\r\ngallantly through the war, traveled as salesman for a Pittsburg house\r\nand in 1870 cast his lot with the oilmen at Parker. A pioneer at\r\nMillerstown and its burgess in 1874, he filled the office capably and in\r\n1876 received a big majority at the Republican primary for the\r\nlegislative nomination. The county-ring counted him out. He drifted with\r\nthe tide to Bullion, removed to Bradford in 1879, was elected mayor in\r\n1885 and discharged his official duties with excellent discretion.\r\nTemperate in habits and upright in conduct, Mayor Shannon had been an\r\nobserver and not a participant in the nether side of oil-region life and\r\nknew where to draw the line. He was a favorite in society, high in\r\nMasonic circles and efficient in securing lands for firms with which he\r\nhad become connected. Pittsburg is now his home and he manages the\r\ncompany that is developing the Wyoming field. Mr. Shannon is always\r\ngenerous and courteous. He could give a scout “the marble heart,”\r\nlecture an offender, denounce a wrong or decline to furnish points\r\nregarding his mystery-well in a good-natured way that disarmed\r\ncriticism. He retains his old-time geniality and prosperity has not\r\ncompelled him to buy hats three sizes larger than he wore at Parker and\r\nMillerstown “in the days of auld lang-syne.”\r\n\r\nA. B. Walker and T. J. Melvin joined Shannon in his Cooper venture. A\r\nroad was cut through the dense forest from the Fox farm-house up the\r\nsteep hill to the Mainwaring derrick. An engine and boiler were dragged\r\nto the spot and Captain Haight contracted to drill the hole. Melvin and\r\nWalker, believing the well a failure at eighteen-hundred feet, went to\r\nCherry Grove on July twenty fifth, 1882. Shannon stayed to urge the\r\ndrill a trifle farther and it struck the sand at one o’clock next day.\r\nHe drove in two pine-plugs, sent a messenger for his partners and filled\r\nthe well with water to shut in the oil. The well wouldn’t consent to be\r\nplugged and drowned. The stream broke loose at three o’clock, hurling\r\nthe tools and plugs into the Forest ozone. Shannon and Haight, standing\r\nin the derrick, narrowly escaped death as the tools crashed through the\r\nroof and fell to the floor. More plugs, sediment and old clothes were\r\njammed down to conceal the true inwardness of the well, news of which\r\nwas expected to pulverize the market. Heavy flows following the\r\nexpulsion of the tools led the owners to anticipate a big strike.\r\nOutposts were established and guards, each armed with a Winchester\r\nrifle, were changed every six hours. The wildcat-well, eight miles from\r\na telegraph-wire, became an entrenched camp with a half-dozen wakeful\r\nscouts besieging the citadel. Vicksburg was not guarded more vigilantly.\r\nIf a twig cracked or an owl hooted a shower of bullets whizzed in the\r\ndirection of the noise. Through August the well was permitted to\r\nslumber, oil that forced a passage in spite of the obstructions running\r\ninto pits inside “the dead-line.” The trade staggered under the adverse\r\nfear of the mystery. Bradford operators formed a syndicate with the\r\nowners in lands and speculation and sold a million barrels of crude\r\nshort. When everything was ready to spring the trap some of the parties\r\nwent to drill out the plugs and usher in the market-crusher. “We have a\r\njack-pot to open at our pleasure” remarked one of them, voicing the\r\nsentiment of all. None looked for anything smaller than fifteen-hundred\r\nbarrels. The four drillers were discharged and two trusted lieutenants\r\nturned the temper-screw and dressed the bits. Ten plugs and a mass of\r\ndirt must be cleaned out. From a distance the scouts timed every motion\r\nof the walking-beam, gluing their eyes to field-glasses that not a\r\nsymptom of a flow might slip their eager gaze, “like stout Cortez when\r\nhe stared at the Pacific upon a peak in Darien.” Swift horses were\r\nfastened to convenient trees, saddled and bridled for a race to the\r\ntelegraph-office. A slice of bread and a can of beans served for food.\r\nFor days the drilling continued. On September fourteenth the last\r\nsplinter of the plugs was extracted, the sand was cut deeper and—the\r\nwell didn’t respond worth a cent! The faithful scouts, who had stood\r\nmanfully between the trade and the manipulators, rushed the report. It\r\nwas a bracer to the market. Bears who pinned their hopes to the Shannon\r\nwell, the pivot upon which petroleum hinged, scrambled to cover their\r\nshorts at heavy loss. Balltown duplicated some of the Cooper\r\nexperiences, mystery-wells on Porcupine Run agitating the trade in the\r\nspring of 1883. The Cherry-Grove, Cooper-Hill and Balltown pools yielded\r\neight or nine-million barrels. Operations extended to Sheffield and the\r\ncream was soon skimmed off. The middle field had enjoyed a very lively\r\ninning.\r\n\r\nTwo miles back of Trunkeyville, on the west side of the Allegheny,\r\nCalvert, Gilchrist & Risley drilled the Venture well in April, 1870, on\r\nthe Tuttle farm. Fisher Brothers, of Oil City, and O. D. Harrington, of\r\nTitusville, bought the well for fifteen-thousand dollars when it touched\r\nthe third sand. It was eight-hundred feet deep, flowed three-hundred\r\nbarrels and started the Fagundas field. The day after it began flowing\r\nthe Fishers, Adnah Neyhart, Grandin Brothers and David Bently paid\r\none-hundred-and-twenty-thousand dollars for the Fagundas farm of\r\none-hundred-and-sixty acres. Mrs. Fagundas, one son and one daughter\r\ndied within three months of the sale. Neyhart & Grandin bought a\r\nhalf-interest in David Beatty’s farm for ninety-thousand dollars. The\r\nLady Burns well, on the Wilkins farm, finished in June, seconded the\r\nVenture. A daily production of three-thousand barrels and a town of\r\ntwenty-five-hundred population followed quickly. A mile from Fagundas\r\noperations on the Hunter, Pearson, Guild and Berry farms brought the\r\nsuburb of Gillespie into being. The territory lasted and a small yield\r\nis obtained to-day. A half-dozen houses, the Venture derrick, Andrews &\r\nCo.’s big store and the office in which whole-souled M. Compton—he’s in\r\nPittsburg with the Forest Oil-Company now—labored as secretary of the\r\nProducers’ Council, hold the fort on the site of well-nigh-forgotten\r\nFagundas. William H. Calvert, who projected the Venture well, died at\r\nSistersville, West Virginia, on February seventeenth, 1896. He had\r\ndrilled on Oil Creek and at Pithole, operated in the southern field and\r\nwas negotiating for a block of lands near Sistersville when a clot of\r\nblood on the brain cut short his active life.\r\n\r\nDavid Beatty had drilled on Oil Creek in 1859-60 with John Fertig. He\r\nsettled on a farm in Warren county “to get away from the oil.” His farm\r\nwas smothered in oil by the Fagundas development. He removed to the\r\npretty town of Warren, building an elegant home on the bank of Conewango\r\nCreek. Fortune hounded him and insisted upon heaping up his riches. John\r\nBell drilled a fifty-barrel well eighty rods above the mansion. Wells\r\nsurrounding his lot and in his yard emitted oil. Mr. Beatty resigned\r\nhimself to the inevitable and lived at Warren until called to his final\r\nrest some years ago. His case resembled the heroine in Milton Nobles’s\r\nPhenix, where “the villain still pursued her.” The boys used to relate\r\nhow a negro, the first man to die at Oil City after the advent of\r\npetroleum, was buried in a lot on the flats. Somebody wanted that\r\nprecise spot next day to drill a well and the corpse was planted on the\r\nhill-side. The next week that particular location was selected for a\r\nwell and the body was again exhumed. To be sure of getting out of reach\r\nof the drill the friends of the deceased boated his remains down the\r\nriver to Butler county. Twelve years later the bones were disinterred—an\r\noil-company having leased the old graveyard—and put in the garden of the\r\ndead man’s son, to be handy for any further change of base that may be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nAt East Hickory the Foster well, drilled in 1863, flowed three-hundred\r\nbarrels of amber oil. Two-hundred wells were sunk in the Hickory\r\ndistrict, which proved as tough as Old Hickory to nineteen-twentieths of\r\nthe operators. Three Hickory Creeks—East Hickory and Little Hickory on\r\nthe east and West Hickory—enter the river within two miles. Near the\r\nmouth of West Hickory three Scotchmen named McKinley bored a well\r\ntwo-hundred-and-thirty feet in 1861. They found oil and were preparing\r\nto tube the well when the war broke out and they abandoned the field. A\r\nwell on the flats, drilled in 1865, flowed two-hundred barrels of\r\nlubricating oil, occasioning a furore. One farm sold for a\r\nhundred-thousand dollars and adjacent lands were snapped up eagerly.\r\n\r\nNinety-five years ago hardy lumbermen settled permanently in Deerfield\r\ntownship, Warren county, thirty miles above the mouth of Oil Creek.\r\nTwenty years later a few inhabitants, supported by the lumber trade, had\r\ncollected near the junction of a small stream with the Allegheny. Bold\r\nhills, grand forests, mountain rills and the winding river, sprinkled\r\nwith green islets, invested the spot with peculiar charms. Upon the\r\ncreek and hamlet the poetic Indian name of Tidioute, signifying a\r\ncluster of islands, was fittingly bestowed. Samuel Grandin, who located\r\nnear Pleasantville, Venango county, in 1822, removed to Tidioute in\r\n1839. He owned large tracts of timber-lands and increased the mercantile\r\nand lumbering operations that gave him prominence and wealth. Mr.\r\nGrandin maintained a high character and died at a ripe age. His oldest\r\nson, John Livingston Grandin, returned from college in 1857 and engaged\r\nin business with his father, assuming almost entire control when the\r\nlatter retired from active pursuits. News of Col. Drake’s well reached\r\nthe four-hundred busy residents of the lumber-center in two days. Col.\r\nRobinson, of Titusville, rehearsed the story of the wondrous event to an\r\nadmiring group in Samuel Grandin’s store. Young J. L. listened intently,\r\nsaddled his horse and in an hour purchased thirty acres of the Campbell\r\nfarm, on Gordon Run, below the village, for three-hundred dollars. An\r\n“oil-spring” on the property was the attraction. Next morning he\r\ncontracted with H. H. Dennis, a man of mechanical skill, to drill a well\r\n“right in the middle of the spring.” The following day a derrick—four\r\npieces of scantling—towered twenty feet, a spring-pole was procured, the\r\n“spring” was dug to the rock, and the “tool” swung at the _first_\r\noil-well in Warren county and among the first in Pennsylvania. Dennis\r\nhammered a drilling-tool from a bar of iron three feet long, flattening\r\none end to cut two-and-a-half inches, the diameter of the hole. In the\r\nupper end of the drill he formed a socket, to hold an inch-bar of round\r\niron, held by a key riveted though and lengthened as the depth required.\r\nTwo or three times a day, when the “tool” was drawn out to sharpen the\r\nbit and clean the hole, the key had to be cut off at each joint! With\r\nthis rude outfit drilling began the first week of September, 1859, and\r\nthe last week of October the well was down one-hundred-and-thirty-four\r\nfeet. Tubing would not go into the hole and it was enlarged to four\r\ninches. The discarded axle of a tram-car, used to carry lumber from\r\nGordon Run to the river, furnished iron for the reamer. Days, weeks and\r\nmonths were consumed at this task. At last, when the hole had been\r\nenlarged its full depth, the reamer was let down “to make sure the job\r\nwas finished.” It stuck fast, never saw daylight again and the well sunk\r\nwith so much labor had not one drop of oil!\r\n\r\nOther wells in the locality fared similarly, none finding oil nearer\r\nthan Dennis Run, a half-mile distant. There scores of large wells\r\nrealized fortunes for their owners. In two years James Parshall was a\r\nhalf-million ahead. He settled at Titusville and built the Parshall\r\nHouse—a mammoth hotel and opera-house—which fire destroyed. The “spring”\r\non the Campell farm is in existence and the gravel is impregnated with\r\npetroleum, supposed to percolate through fissures in the rocks from\r\nDennis Run.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1860 developments extended across and down the\r\nriver a mile from Tidioute. The first producing well in the district,\r\nowned by King & Ferris, of Titusville, started in the fall at\r\nthree-hundred barrels and boomed the territory amazingly. It was on the\r\nW. W. Wallace lands—five-hundred acres below town—purchased in 1860 by\r\nthe Tidioute & Warren Oil-Company, the third in the world. Samuel\r\nGrandin, Charles Hyde and Jonathan Watson organized it. J. L. Grandin,\r\ntreasurer and manager of the company, in eight years paid the\r\nstockholders twelve-hundred-thousand dollars dividends on a capital of\r\nten-thousand! He leased and sub-leased farms on both sides of the\r\nAllegheny, drilling some dry-holes, many medium wells and a few large\r\nones. He shipped crude to the seaboard, built pipe-lines and iron-tanks\r\nand became head of the great firm of Grandins & Neyhart. Elijah Bishop\r\nGrandin—named from the father of C. E. Bishop, founder of the Oil-City\r\n_Derrick_—who had carried on a store at Hydetown and operated at\r\nPetroleum Centre, resumed his residence at Tidioute in 1867 and\r\nassociated with his brother and brother-in-law, Adnah Neyhart, in\r\nproducing, buying, storing and transporting petroleum. Mr. Neyhart and\r\nJoshua Pierce, of Philadelphia, had drilled on Cherry Run, on Dennis Run\r\nand at Triumph and engaged largely in shipping oil to the coast. Pierce\r\n& Neyhart—J. L. Grandin was their silent partner—dissolved in 1869. The\r\nfirm of Grandins & Neyhart, organized in 1868, was marvelously\r\nsuccessful. Its high standing increased confidence in the stability of\r\nfinancial and commercial affairs in the oil-regions. The brothers\r\nestablished the Grandin Bank and Neyhart, besides handling one-fourth of\r\nthe crude produced in Pennsylvania, opened a commission-house in New\r\nYork to sell refined, under the skilled management of John D. Archbold,\r\nnow vice-president of the Standard Oil-Company. They and the Fisher\r\nBrothers owned the Dennis Run and Triumph pipe-lines and piped the oil\r\nfrom Fagundas, where they drilled a hundred prolific wells and were the\r\nlargest operators. They bought properties in different portions of the\r\noil-fields, extended their pipe-lines to Titusville and erected tankage\r\nat Parker and Miller Farm. The death of Mr. Neyhart terminated their\r\nconnection with oil-shipments.\r\n\r\n                    “There is no parley with death.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. L. GRANDIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADNAH NEYHART.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: E. B. GRANDIN.]\r\n\r\nOwning thousands of acres in Warren and Forest counties, the\r\nGrandins were heavily interested in developments at Cherry Grove,\r\nBalltown and Cooper. As those sections declined they gradually\r\nwithdrew from active oil-operations, sold their pipe-lines and wound\r\nup their bank. J. L. Grandin removed to Boston and E. B. to\r\nWashington, to embark in new enterprises and enjoy, under most\r\nfavorable conditions, the fruits of their prosperous career at\r\nTidioute. Their business for ten years has been chiefly loaning\r\nmoney, farming and lumbering in the west. They purchased\r\nseventy-two-thousand acres in the Red-River Valley of Dakota—known\r\nthe world over as “the Dalrymple Farm”—and in 1895 harvested\r\nsix-hundred-thousand bushels of wheat and oats. They employ hundreds\r\nof men and horses, scores of ploughs and reapers and steam-threshers\r\nand illustrate how to farm profitably on the biggest scale. With\r\nHunter & Cummings, of Tidioute, and J. B. White, of Kansas City, as\r\npartners, they organized the Missouri-Lumber-and-Mining-Company. The\r\ncompany owns two-hundred-and-forty-thousand acres of timber-land in\r\nMissouri and cut fifty-million feet of lumber last year in its vast\r\nsaw-mills at Grandin, Carter county. Far-seeing, clear-headed, of\r\nunblemished repute and liberal culture, such men as J. L. and E. B.\r\nGrandin reflect honor upon humanity and deserve the success an\r\napproving conscience and the popular voice commend heartily.\r\n\r\nAbove Tidioute a number of “farmers’ wells”—shallow holes sunk by hand\r\nand soon abandoned—flickered and collapsed. On the islands in the river\r\nsmall wells were drilled, most of which the great flood of 1865\r\ndestroyed. Opposite the town, on the Economite lands, operations began\r\nin 1860. Steam-power was used for the first time in drilling. The wells\r\nranged from five barrels to eighty, at one-hundred-and-fifty feet. They\r\nbelonged to the Economites, a German society that enforced celibacy and\r\nheld property in common. About 1820 the association founded the village\r\nof Harmony, Butler county, having an exclusive colony and transacting\r\nbusiness with outsiders through the medium of two trustees. The members\r\nwore a plain garb and were distinguished for morality, simplicity,\r\nindustry and strict religious principles. Leaving Harmony, they located\r\nin the Wabash Valley, lost many adherents, returned to Pennsylvania and\r\nbuilt the town of Economy, in Beaver county, fifteen miles below\r\nPittsburg. They manufactured silks and wine, mined coal and accumulated\r\nmillions of dollars. A loan to William Davidson, owner of eight-thousand\r\nacres in Limestone township, Warren county, obliged them to foreclose\r\nthe mortgage and bid in the tract. Their notions of economy applied to\r\nthe wells, which they numbered alphabetically. The first, A well,\r\nyielded ten barrels, B pumped fifty and C flowed seventy. The trustees,\r\nR. L. Baker and Jacob Henrici, erected a large boarding-house for the\r\nworkmen, whose speech and manners were regulated by printed rules. Pine\r\nand oak covered the Davidson lands, which fronted several miles on the\r\nAllegheny and stretched far back into the township. Of late years the\r\nEconomite Society has been disintegrating, until its membership has\r\nshrunk to a dozen aged men and women. Litigation and mismanagement have\r\nfrittered away much of its property. It seems odd that an organization\r\nholding “all things in common” should, by the perversity of fate, own\r\nsome of the nicest oil-territory in Warren, Butler and Beaver counties.\r\nA recent strike on one of the southern farms flows sixty barrels an\r\nhour. Natural gas lighted and heated Harmony and petroleum appears bound\r\nto stick to the Economites until they have faded into oblivion.\r\n\r\nBelow the Economite tract numerous wells strove to impoverish the\r\nfirst sand. G. I. Stowe’s, drilled in 1860, pumped eight barrels a\r\nday for six years. The Hockenburg, named from a preacher who wrote\r\nan essay on oil, averaged twelve barrels a day in 1861. The\r\nEnterprise Mining-and-Boring-Company of New-York leased fifteen rods\r\nsquare on the Tipton farm to sink a shaft seven feet by twelve.\r\nBed-rock was reached at thirty feet, followed by ten feet of shale,\r\nten of gray sand, forty of slate and soap-rock and twenty of first\r\nsand. The shaft, cribbed with six-inch plank to the bottom of the\r\nfirst sand, tightly caulked to keep out water, was abandoned at\r\none-hundred-and-sixty feet, a gas-explosion killing the\r\nsuperintendent and wrecking the timbers. Of forty wells on the\r\nTipton farm in 1860-61 not a fragment remained in 1866.\r\n\r\nTidioute’s laurel wreath was Triumph Hill, the highest elevation in the\r\nneighborhood. Wells nine-hundred feet deep pierced sixty feet of\r\noil-bearing sand, which produced steadily for years. Grandins, Fisher\r\nBrothers, M. G. Cushing, E. E. Clapp, John M. Clapp and other leading\r\noperators landed bounteous pumpers. The east side of the hill was a\r\nforest of derricks, crowded like trees in a grove. Over the summit and\r\ndown the west side the sand and the development extended. For five years\r\nTriumph was busy and prosperous, yielding hundreds-of-thousands of\r\nbarrels of oil and advancing Tidioute to a town of five-thousand\r\npopulation. Five churches, the finest school-buildings in the county,\r\nhandsome houses, brick blocks, superior hotels and large stores greeted\r\nthe eye of the visitor. The Grandin Block, the first brick structure,\r\nbuilt of the first brick made in Deerfield township, contained an\r\nelegant opera-house. Three banks, three planing-mills, two foundries and\r\nthree machine-shops flourished. A dozen refineries turned out\r\nmerchantable kerosene. Water-works were provided and an iron bridge\r\nspanned the river. Good order was maintained and Tidioute—still a tidy\r\nvillage—played second fiddle to no town in Oildom for intelligence,\r\nenterprise and all-round attractiveness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW ON WEST SIDE OF TRIUMPH HILL IN 1874.]\r\n\r\nThe tidal wave effervesced at intervals clear to the Colorado district.\r\nPerched on a hill in the hemlock woods, Babylon was the rendezvous of\r\nsports, strumpets and plug-uglies, who stole, gambled, caroused and did\r\ntheir best to break all the commandments at once. Could it have spoken,\r\nwhat tales of horror that board-house under the evergreen tree might\r\nrecount! Hapless wretches were driven to desperation and fitted for the\r\ninfernal regions. Lust and liquor goaded men to frenzy, resulting\r\nsometimes in homicide or suicide. In an affray one night four men were\r\nshot, one dying in an hour and another in six weeks. Ben. Hogan, who\r\nlaughed at the feeble efforts of the township-constable to suppress his\r\nresort, was arrested, tried for murder and acquitted on the plea of\r\nself-defence. The shot that killed the first victim was supposed to have\r\nbeen fired by “French Kate,” Hogan’s mistress. She had led the\r\ndemi-monde in Washington and led susceptible congressmen astray. Ben met\r\nher at Pithole, where he landed in the summer of 1865 and ran a\r\nvariety-show that would make the vilest on the Bowery blush to the roots\r\nof its hair. He had been a prize-fighter on land, a pirate at sea, a\r\nbounty-jumper and blockade-runner, and prided himself on his title of\r\nthe “Wickedest Man in the World.” Sentenced to death for his crimes\r\nagainst the government, President Lincoln pardoned him and he joined the\r\nmyriad reckless spirits that sought fresh adventures in the Pennsylvania\r\noil-fields. In a few months the Scripture legend—“Babylon has\r\nfallen”—applied to the malodorous Warren town. The tiger can “change his\r\nspots”—by moving from one spot to another—and so could Hogan. He was of\r\nmedium height, square-shouldered, stout-limbed, exceedingly muscular and\r\ntrained to use his fists. He fought Tom Allen at Omaha, sported at\r\nSaratoga and in 1872 ran “The Floating Palace”—a boat laden with harlots\r\nand whiskey—at Parker. The weather growing too cold and the law too hot\r\nfor comfort, he opened a den and built an opera-house at Petrolia. In\r\n“Hogan’s Castle” many a clever young man learned the short-cut to\r\ndisgrace and perdition. Now and then a frail girl met a sad fate, but\r\nthe carnival of debauchery went on without interruption. Hogan put on\r\nairs, dressed in the loudest style and would have been the burgess had\r\nnot the election-board counted him out! A fearless newspaper forcing him\r\nto leave Petrolia, Hogan went east to engage in “the sawdust swindle,”\r\nreturned to the oil-regions in 1875, built an opera-house at Elk City,\r\ndecamped from Bullion, rooted at Tarport and Bradford and departed by\r\nnight for New York. Surfeited with revelry and about to start for Paris\r\nto open a joint, he heard music at a hall on Broadway and sat down to\r\nwait for the show to begin. Charles Sawyer, “the converted soak,”\r\nappeared shortly, read a chapter from the Bible and told of his rescue\r\nfrom the gutter. Ben was deeply impressed, signed the pledge at the\r\nclose of the service, agonized in his room until morning and on his\r\nknees implored forgiveness. How surprised the angels must have been at\r\nthe spectacle of the prodigal in this attitude! After a fierce struggle,\r\nto quote his own words, “peace filled my soul chock-full and I felt\r\nawful happy.” He claimed to be converted and set to work earnestly to\r\nlearn the alphabet, that he might read the Scriptures and be an\r\nevangelist. He married “French Kate,” who also professed religion, but\r\nit didn’t strike in very deep and she eloped with a tough. Mr. Moody\r\nwelcomed Hogan and advised him to traverse the country to offset as far\r\nas possible his former misdeeds. Amid the scenes of his grossest\r\noffenses his reception varied. High-toned Christians, who would not\r\ntouch a down-trodden wretch with a ten-foot pole, turned up their\r\ndelicate noses and refused to countenance “the low impostor.” They\r\nforgot that he sold his jewelry and most of his clothes, lived on bread\r\nand water and endured manifold privations to become a bearer of the\r\ngospel-message. Even ministers who proclaimed that “the blood of Christ\r\ncleanses from _all_ sin” doubted Hogan’s salvation and showed him the\r\ncold shoulder in the chilliest orthodox fashion. He stuck manfully and\r\nfor eighteen years has labored zealously in the vineyard. Judging from\r\nhis struggles and triumphs, is it too much to believe that a front seat\r\nand a golden crown are reserved for the reformed pugilist, felon,\r\nrobber, assassin of virtue and right bower of Old Nick? Unlike\r\nstraddlers in politics and piety, who want to go to Heaven on\r\nvelvet-cushions and pneumatic tires,\r\n\r\n                  “He doesn’t stand on one foot fust,\r\n                    An’ then stand on the other,\r\n                  An’ on which one he feels the wust\r\n                    He couldn’t tell you nuther.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEWIS F. WATSON.]\r\n\r\nThe expectation of an extension of the belt northward was not fulfilled\r\nimmediately. Wells at Irvineton, on the Brokenstraw and tributary runs,\r\nfailed to find the coveted fluid. Captain Dingley drilled two wells on\r\nSell’s Run, three miles east of Irvineton, in 1873, without slitting the\r\njugular. A test well at Warren, near the mouth of Conewango Creek, bored\r\nin 1864 and burned as pumping was about to begin, had fair sand and a\r\nmite of oil. John Bell’s operations in 1875 opened an amber pool up the\r\ncreek that for a season crowded the hotels three deep with visitors.\r\nThey bored dozens of wells, yet the production never reached\r\none-thousand barrels and in four months the patch was cordoned by dry\r\nholes and as quiet as a cemetery. The crowds exhaled like morning dew.\r\nWarren is a pretty town of four-thousand population, its location and\r\nnatural advantages offering rare inducements to people of refinement and\r\nenterprise. Its site was surveyed in 1795 and the first shipment of\r\nlumber to Pittsburg was made in 1801. Incorporated as a borough in 1832,\r\nrailroad communication with Erie was secured in 1859, with Oil City in\r\n1867 and with Bradford in 1881. Many of the private residences are\r\nmodels of good taste. Massive brick-blocks, solvent banks, churches,\r\nstores, high-grade schools, shaded streets and modern conveniences\r\nevidence its substantial prosperity. Hon. Thomas Struthers—he built\r\nsections of the Philadelphia & Erie and the Oil-Creek railroads and\r\nestablished big iron-works—donated a splendid brick building for a\r\nlibrary, opera-house and post-office. His grandson, who inherited his\r\nmillions and died in February, 1896, was a mild edition of “Coal-Oil\r\nJohnnie” in scattering money. Lumbering, the principal industry for\r\nthree generations, enriched the community. Col. Lewis F. Watson\r\nrepresented the district twice in Congress and left an estate of\r\nfour-millions, amassed in lumber and oil. He owned most of the township\r\nbearing his name. Hon. Charles W. Stone, his successor, ranks with the\r\nforemost members of the House in ability and influence. A Massachusetts\r\nboy, he set out in life as a teacher, came to Warren to take charge of\r\nthe academy, was county-superintendent, studied law and rose to eminence\r\nat the bar. He was elected Lieutenant-Governor of the State, served as\r\nSecretary of the Commonwealth and would be Governor of Pennsylvania\r\nto-day had “the foresight of the Republicans been as good as their\r\nhindsight.” He has profitable oil-interests, is serving his fourth term\r\nin Congress and may be nominated the fifth time. Alike fortunate in his\r\npolitical and professional career, his social relations, his business\r\nconnections and his personal friendships, Charles W. Stone holds a place\r\nin public esteem few men are privileged to attain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES W. STONE.]\r\n\r\nAt Clarendon and Stoneham hundreds of snug wells yielded three-thousand\r\nbarrels a day from a regular sand that did not exhaust readily.\r\nSouthward the Garfield district held on fairly and a narrow-gauge\r\nrailroad was built to Farnsworth. The Wardwell pool, at Glade, four\r\nmiles east of Warren, fizzed after the manner of Cherry Grove, rich in\r\nburied hopes and dissipated greenbacks. P. M. Smith and Peter Grace\r\ndrilled the first well—a sixty-barreler—close to the ferry in July of\r\n1873. Dry-holes and small wells alternated with provoking uncertainty\r\nuntil J. A. Gartland’s twelve-hundred-barrel gusher on the Clark farm,\r\nin May of 1885, inaugurated a panic in the market that sent crude down\r\nto fifty cents. The same day the Union Oil-Company finished a\r\nfour-hundred-barrel spouter and May ended with fifty-six wells producing\r\nand a score of dusters. June and July continued the refrain, values\r\nsee-sawing as reports of dry-holes or fifteen-hundred-barrel-strikes,\r\nsome of them worked as “mysteries,” bamboozled the trade. Wardwell’s\r\nproduction ascended to twelve-thousand barrels and fell by the dizziest\r\njumps to as many hundred, the porous rock draining with the speed of a\r\nlightning-calculator. Tiona developed a lasting deposit of superior oil.\r\nKane has a tempting streak, in which Thomas B. Simpson and other\r\nOil-City parties are interested. Gas has been found at Wilcox,\r\nJohnsonburg and Ridgway, Elk county, taking a slick hand in the game.\r\nKinzua, four miles north-east of Wardwell, revealed no particular cause\r\nwhy the spirit of mortal ought to be proud. Although Forest and Warren,\r\nwith a slice of Elk thrown in, were demoralizing factors in 1882-3-4,\r\ntheir aggregate output would only be a light luncheon for the polar bear\r\nin McKean county.\r\n\r\nThe Tidioute belt, varying in narrowness from a few rods to a half-mile,\r\nwas one of the most satisfactory ever discovered. When lessees fully\r\noccupied the flats Captain A. J. Thompson drilled a two-hundred-barrel\r\nwell on the point, at the junction of Dingley and Dennis Runs. Quickly\r\nthe summit was scaled and amid drilling wells, pumping wells, oil-tanks\r\nand engine-houses the town of Triumph was created. Triumph Hill turned\r\nout as much money to the acre as any spot in Oildom. The sand was the\r\nthickest—often ninety to one-hundred-and-ten feet—and the purest the\r\noil-region afforded. Some of the wells pumped twenty years. Salt-water\r\nwas too plentiful for comfort, but half-acre plots were grabbed at\r\none-half royalty and five-hundred dollars bonus. Wells jammed so closely\r\nthat a man could walk from Triumph to New London and Babylon on the\r\nsteam-boxes connecting them. Percy Shaw—he built the Shaw House—had a\r\n“royal flush” on Dennis Run that netted two-hundred-thousand dollars.\r\nFrom an investment of fifteen-thousand dollars E. E. and J. M. Clapp\r\ncleared a half-million.\r\n\r\n“Spirits” located the first well at Stoneham and Cornen Brothers’ gasser\r\nat Clarendon furnished the key that unlocked Cherry Grove. Gas was piped\r\nfrom the Cornen well to Warren and Jamestown. Walter Horton was the\r\nmoving spirit in the Sheffield field, holding interests in the Darling\r\nand Blue Jay wells and owning forty-thousand acres of land in Forest\r\ncounty. McGrew Brothers, of Pittsburg, spent many thousands seeking a\r\npool at Garland. Grandin & Kelly’s operations below Balltown exploded\r\nthe theory that oil would not be found on the south side of Tionesta\r\nCreek. Cherry Grove was at its apex when, in July of 1884, with\r\nFarnsworth and Garfield boiling over, two wells on the Thomas farm, a\r\nmile south-east of Richburg, flowed six-hundred barrels apiece. They\r\nwere among the largest in the Allegany district, but a three-line\r\nmention in the Bradford _Era_ was all the notice given the pair.\r\n\r\nTo the owner of a tract near “646,” who offered to sell it for\r\nfifty-thousand dollars, a Bradford operator replied: “I would take it at\r\nyour figure if I thought my check would be paid, but I’ll take it at\r\nforty-five-thousand whether the check is paid or not!” The check was not\r\naccepted.\r\n\r\nTack Brothers drilled a dry-hole twenty-six-hundred feet in Millstone\r\ntownship, Elk county. Grandin & Kelly drilled four-thousand feet in\r\nForest county and got lots of geological information, but no oil.\r\n\r\nGet off the train at Trunkeyville—a station-house and water-tank—and\r\nclimb up the hill towards Fagundas. After walking through the woods a\r\nmile an opening appears. A man is plowing. The soil looks too poor to\r\nraise grasshoppers, yet that man during the oil-excitement refused an\r\noffer of sixty-thousand dollars for this farm. His principal reason was\r\nthat he feared a suitable house into which to move his family could not\r\nbe obtained! On a little farther a pair of old bull-wheels, lying\r\nunused, tells that the once productive Fagundas pool has been reached. A\r\nshort distance ahead on an eminence is a church. This is South Fagundas.\r\nNo sound save the crowing of a chanticleer from a distant farm-yard\r\nbreaks the silence. The merry voices heard in the seventies are no\r\nlonger audible, the drill and pump are not at work, the dwellings,\r\nstores and hotels have disappeared. The deserted church stands alone. A\r\nfew landmarks linger at Fagundas proper. There is one store and no place\r\nwhere the weary traveler can quench his thirst. The nearest resemblance\r\nto a drinking-place is a boy leaning over a barrel drinking rain-water\r\nwhile another lad holds him by the feet. Fagundas is certainly “dry.”\r\nThe stranger is always taken to the Venture well. Its appearance differs\r\nlittle from that of hundreds of other abandoned wells. The conductor and\r\nthe casing have not been removed. Robert W. Pimm, who built the rig,\r\nstill lives at Fagundas. He will be remembered by many, for he is a\r\njovial fellow and was “one of the boys.” The McQuade—the biggest in the\r\nfield—the Bird and the Red Walking-beam were noted wells. If Dr.\r\nStillson were to hunt up the office where he extracted teeth “without\r\npain” he would find the building used as a poultry-house. Men went to\r\nFagundas poor and departed with sufficient wealth to live in luxury the\r\nrest of their lives; others went wealthy and lost everything in a vain\r\nsearch for the greasy fluid. Passing through what was known as Gillespie\r\nand traversing three miles of a lonely section, covered with scrub-oak\r\nand small pine, Triumph is reached. It is not the Triumph oil-men knew\r\ntwenty-five years ago, when it had four-thousand population, four good\r\nhotels, two drug-stores, four hardware-stores, a half-dozen groceries\r\nand many other places of business. No other oil-field ever held so many\r\nderricks upon the same area. The Clapp farm has a production of twelve\r\nbarrels per day. Traces of the town are almost completely blotted out.\r\nThe pilgrim traveling over the hill would never suspect that a rousing\r\noil-town occupied the farm on which an industrious Swede has a crop of\r\noats. Along Babylon hill, once dotted with derricks thickly as trees in\r\nthe forest, nothing remains to indicate the spot where stood the\r\nephemeral town.\r\n\r\n               “We are such stuff as dreams are made of.”\r\n\r\nJohn Henderson, a tall, handsome man, came from the east during the\r\noil-excitement in Warren county and located at Garfield. In a fight at a\r\ngambling-house one night George Harkness was thrown out of an\r\nupstairs-window and his neck broken. Foul play was suspected, although\r\nthe evidence implicated no one, and the coroner’s jury returned a\r\nverdict of accidental death. Harkness had left a young bride in\r\nPhiladelphia and was out to seek his fortune. Henderson, feeling in a\r\ndegree responsible for his death, began sending anonymous letters to the\r\nbereaved wife, each containing fifty to a hundred dollars. The letters\r\nwere first mailed every month from Garfield, then from Bradford, then\r\nfrom Chicago and for three years from Montana. In 1893 she received from\r\nthe writer of these letters a request for an interview. This was\r\ngranted, the acquaintance ripened into love and the pair were married!\r\nHenderson is a wealthy stockman in Montana. In 1867 an English vessel\r\nwent to pieces in a terrible storm on the coast of Maine. The captain\r\nand many passengers were drowned. Among the saved were two children, the\r\ncaptain’s daughters. One was adopted by a merchant of Dover, N. H. He\r\ngave her a good education, she grew up a beautiful woman and it was she\r\nwho married George Harkness and John Henderson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T. J. VANDERGRIFT.]\r\n\r\nBalltown was the chief pet of T. J. Vandergrift, now head and front of\r\nthe Woodland Oil-Company, and he harvested bushels of money from the\r\nmiddle-field. “Op” Vandergrift is not an apprentice in petroleum. He\r\nadded to his reputation in the middle-field leading the opposition to\r\nthe mystery-dodge. Napoleon or Grant was not a finer tactician. His\r\nclever plans were executed without a hitch or a Waterloo. He neither\r\nlost his temper nor wasted his powder. The man who “fights the devil\r\nwith fire” is apt to run short of ammunition, but Vandergrift knew the\r\nropes, kept his own counsel, was “cool as a cucumber” and won in an easy\r\ncanter. He is obliging, social, manfully independent and a zealous\r\nworker in the Producers’ Association. It is narrated that he went to New\r\nYork three years ago to close a big deal for Ohio territory he had been\r\nasked to sell. He named the price and was told a sub-boss at Oil City\r\nmust pass upon the matter. “Gentlemen,” he said, “I am not going to Oil\r\nCity on any such errand. I came prepared to transfer the property and,\r\nif you want it, I shall be in the city until noon to-morrow to receive\r\nthe money!” The cash—three-hundred-thousand dollars—was paid at eleven\r\no’clock. Mr. Vandergrift has interests in Pennsylvania, Ohio,\r\nWest-Virginia and Kentucky. He knows a good horse, a good story, a good\r\nlease or a good fellow at sight and a wildcat-well does not frighten him\r\noff the track. His home is at Jamestown and his office at Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nThe Anchor Oil-Company’s No. 1, the first well finished near “646,” in\r\nWarren county, flowed two-thousand barrels a day on the ground until\r\ntanks could be provided. It burned when flowing a thousand barrels and\r\nfor ten days could not be extinguished. One man wanted to steam it to\r\ndeath, another to drown it, another to squeeze its life out, another to\r\nsmother it with straw, another to dig a hole and cut off the flow,\r\nanother to roll a big log over it, another to blow out its brains with\r\ndynamite, another to blind it with carbolic acid, another to throw up\r\nearth-works and so on until the pestered owners wished five-hundred\r\ncranks were in the asylum at North Warren. Pipes were finally attached\r\nin such a way as to draw off the oil and the flame died out.\r\n\r\nThe first funeral at Fagundas was a novelty. A soap-peddler, stopping at\r\nthe Rooling House one night, died of delirium-tremens. He was put into a\r\nrough coffin and a small party set off to inter the corpse. Somebody\r\nthought it mean to bury a fellow-creature without some signs of respect.\r\nThe party returned to the hotel with the body, a large crowd assembled\r\nin the evening, flowers decorated the casket, services were conducted\r\nand at dead of night two-hundred oil-men followed the friendless\r\nstranger to his grave.\r\n\r\nThis year, at a drilling well near Tiona, the workmen of Contractor\r\nMeeley were surprised to strike oil three feet from the surface. A\r\nstream of the real stuff flowed over the top of the derrick, scattering\r\nseven men who happened to be standing on the floor. Fortunately no fire\r\nwas about the structure, hence a thorough soaking with seventy-cent\r\ncrude was the chief damage to the crew and the spectators. Visions of a\r\nnew sand close to the grass-roots filled the minds of all beholders. At\r\nthat rate every man, woman, boy, girl and baby who could burrow a yard\r\ninto the earth might have a paying well. The cool-headed foreman, R. G.\r\nThompson, decided to investigate before ordering tankage and taking down\r\nthe tools. He discovered that the derrick had been set directly above a\r\nsix-inch pipe-line, which the bit had punctured, thus letting the oil\r\nescape under the heavy pressure of a fifty-ton pump. Word was sent to\r\nthe pump-station to shut off the flow, a new joint of pipe was put in\r\nand drilling proceeded to the third sand without further disturbance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. H. STALEY.]\r\n\r\nOne bright day in the summer of 1873 an active youth, beardless and\r\nboyish in appearance, dropped into Fagundas. With little cash, but no\r\nend of energy and pluck, he soon picked up a lease. Fortune smiled upon\r\nhim and he followed the surging tide to the different pastures as they\r\ncame into line. He operated at Bradford, Tiona, Clarendon, in Clarion\r\ncounty, in Ohio and Indiana. West Virginia has been his best hold for\r\nsome years, and the boys all know W. H. Staley as a live oilman, who has\r\nstayed with the procession two-dozen years.\r\n\r\nStories of the late E. E. Clapp’s rare humor and rare goodness of heart\r\nmight be recited by the score. He never grew weary helping the poor and\r\nthe unfortunate. Once a zealous Methodist minister, whose meagre salary\r\nwas not half-paid, thought of leaving his mission from lack of support.\r\nClapp heard the tale and handed the good man a sealed envelope, telling\r\nhim not to open it until he reached home and gave it to his wife. It\r\ncontained a check for five-hundred-dollars. Like thousands of producers,\r\nClapp was sued by the torpedo-monopoly for alleged infringement of the\r\nRoberts patent. Meeting Col. E. A. L. Roberts at Titusville while the\r\nsuit was pending, he was invited to go through the great building\r\nRoberts Brothers were completing. The delegate from President peered\r\ninto the corners of the first room as though looking for something. The\r\nColonel’s curiosity was aroused and he inquired what the visitor meant.\r\n“Oh,” came the quick rejoinder, “I’m only trying to find where the\r\ntwenty-thousand-dollars I’ve paid you for torpedoes may be built in\r\nthese walls!” A laugh followed and Roberts proposed to square the suit,\r\nwhich was done forthwith. At a country-fair E. Harvey, the Oil-City\r\nmusic-dealer, played and sang one of Gerald Massey’s sublime\r\ncompositions with thrilling effect. Among the eager listeners was E. E.\r\nClapp, beside whom stood a farmer’s wife. The woman shouted to Harvey:\r\n“Tech it off agin, stranger, but don’t make so much noise yerself!” Poor\r\nHarvey—dead long ago—subsided and Clapp took up the expression, which he\r\noften quoted at the expense of loquacious acquaintances. Humanity lost a\r\nfriend when Edwin Emmett Clapp left the smooth roads of President to\r\nwalk the golden streets of the New Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nUp the winding river proved in not a few instances the straight path to\r\na handsome fortune, while some found only shoals and quicksands.\r\n\r\n                            THE AMEN CORNER.\r\n\r\nBetter a kink in the hair than a kink in the character.\r\n\r\nGood creeds are all right, but good deeds are the stuff that won’t\r\nshrink in the washing.\r\n\r\nDomestic infidelity does more harm than unbelieving infidelity and\r\nhearsay knocks heresy galley-west as a mischief-maker.\r\n\r\n                  Stick to the right with iron nerve,\r\n                  Nor from the path of duty swerve,\r\n                  Then your reward you will deserve.\r\n\r\nThe Baptists of Franklin offered Rev. Dr. Lorimer, the eminent Chicago\r\ndivine, a residence and eight-thousand dollars a year to become their\r\npastor. How was that for a church in a town of six-thousand population?\r\n\r\n“Pray—pray—pray for—” The good minister bent down to catch the whisper\r\nof the dying operator, whom he had asked whether he should petition the\r\nthrone of grace—“pray for five-dollar oil!”\r\n\r\nSt. Joseph’s church, Oil City, is the finest in the oil-region and has\r\nthe finest altar in the state. Father Carroll, for twenty years in\r\ncharge of the parish, is a priest whose praises all denominations carol.\r\n\r\n                  You “want to be an angel?”\r\n                    Well, no need to look solemn;\r\n                  If you haven’t got what you desire,\r\n                    Put an ad. in the want column.\r\n\r\nThe Presbyterian church at Rouseville, torn down years ago, was built,\r\npaid for, furnished handsomely and run nine months before having a\r\nsettled pastor. Not a lottery, fair, bazaar or grab-bag scheme was\r\nresorted to in order to raise the funds.\r\n\r\nThe Salvation Army once scored a sensational hit in the oil-regions. A\r\nlieutenant struck a can of nitro-glycerine with his little tambourine\r\nand every house in the settlement entertained more or less\r\nSalvation-Army soldier for a month after the blow-up.\r\n\r\n                     “Like a sawyer’s work is life—\r\n                       The present makes the flaw,\r\n                     And the only field for strife\r\n                       Is the inch before the saw.”\r\n\r\n“What are the wages of sin?” asked the teacher of Ah Sin, the first\r\nChinese laundryman at Bradford, who was an attentive member of a class\r\nin the Sunday-school. Promptly came the answer: “Sebenty-flive cente a\r\ndozen; no checkee, no washee!”\r\n\r\nThe first sound of a church-bell at Pithole was heard on Saturday\r\nevening, March 24, 1866, from the Methodist-Episcopal belfry. The first\r\nchurch-bell at Oil City was hung in a derrick by the side of the\r\nMethodist church, on the site of a grocery opposite the _Blizzard_\r\noffice. At first Sunday was not observed. Flowing-wells flowed and\r\nowners of pumping wells pumped as usual. Work went right along seven\r\ndays in the week, even by people who believed the highest type of church\r\nwas not an engine-house, with a derrick for its tower, a well for its\r\nBible and a tube spouting oil for its preacher.\r\n\r\n            “If you have gentle words and looks, my friends,\r\n                To spare for me—if you have tears to shed\r\n            That I have suffered—keep them not I pray\r\n                Until I hear not, see not, being dead.”\r\n\r\nMany people regard religion as they do small-pox; they desire to have it\r\nas light as possible and are very careful that it does not mark them.\r\nMost people when they perform an act of charity prefer to have it like\r\nthe measles—on the outside where it can be seen. Oil-region folks are\r\nnot built that way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UP THE ALLEGHENY RIVER.]\r\n\r\n         -RICHBURG, N.Y. 1879-        -TARPORT AND TUNA VALLEY-\r\n               GENERAL VIEW OF BRADFORD.\r\n                    ECONOMITE WELLS OPPOSITE TIDIOUTE\r\n         A GLIMPSE OF WARREN\r\n                                           -BABYLON-\r\n                             EXCHANGE HOTEL TIDIOUTE 1863\r\n         TIDIOUTE 1876\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XI.\r\n                       A BEE-LINE FOR THE NORTH.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BRADFORD REGION LOOMS UP—MILES OF FIRST-CLASS\r\n    TERRITORY—LEADING OPERATORS—JOHN MCKEOWN’S MILLIONS—MANY LIVELY\r\n    TOWNS—OVER THE NEW-YORK BORDER—ALL ABOARD FOR RICHBURG—CROSSING INTO\r\n    CANADA—SHAW’S STRIKE—THE POLAR REGION PLAYS A STRONG HAND IN THE\r\n    GAME OF TAPPING NATURE’S LABORATORY.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n“Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses\r\n    north.”—_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n“Be sure you’re right, then go ahead.”—_Davy Crockett._\r\n\r\n“Jes foller de no’th star an’ yu’ll come out right, shuah.”—_Joel\r\n    Chandler Harris._\r\n\r\n“Better a year of Bradford than a cycle of Cathay.”—_L.

At times men\r\nhave supposed the limits of juicy territory had been reached, only to be\r\nstartled by the unexpected opening of a larger, grander field than any\r\nthat preceded it. Guessing the weather a month ahead is child’s play in\r\ncomparison with guessing where oil may be found in paying quantity.\r\nGeology is liable to shoot wide of the mark, so that the drill is the\r\none indisputable test, from which there is no appeal for an injunction\r\nor a reversal of the verdict. Years of waiting sharpened the appetite of\r\nthe polar bear for the feast to be spread in McKean county and across\r\nthe New-York border. Tempting tidbits prepared the hungry animal to\r\ndigest the rich courses that were to follow in close succession, until\r\nthe whole world was cloyed and gorged, and surfeited with petroleum. It\r\ncould not hold another mouthful, and the surplus had to be stored in\r\nhuge tanks ready for the demand certain to come some day and empty the\r\nvast receptacles of their last drop.\r\n\r\n                 “Still linger, in our northern clime,\r\n                 Some remnants of the good old time.”\r\n\r\nThe United States Land-Company, holding a quarter-million acres in\r\nMcKean and adjoining counties, in 1837 sent Col. Levitt C. Little from\r\nNew Hampshire to look after its interests. He located on Tuna Creek,\r\neight miles from the southern border of New-York state. The Websters\r\narrived in 1838, journeying by canoe from Olean. Other families settled\r\nin the valley, founding the hamlet of Littleton, which in 1858 adopted\r\nthe name of Bradford and became a borough in 1872, with Peter T. Kennedy\r\nas burgess. The vast forests were divided into huge blocks, such as the\r\nBingham, Borden, Clark & Babcock, Kingsbury and Quintuple tracts. Lumber\r\nwas rafted to distant points and thousands of hardy woodmen “shantied”\r\nin rough huts each winter. They beguiled the long evenings singing\r\ncoarse songs, playing cards, imbibing the vintage of Kentucky or New\r\nEngland from a black jug and telling stories so bald the mules drooped\r\ntheir ears to hide their blushes. But they were open-hearted, sternly\r\nhonest, sticklers for fair-play, hard-working and admirable forerunners\r\nof the approaching civilization. To the sturdy blows of the rugged\r\nchopper and raftsman all classes are indebted for fuel, shelter and\r\ninnumerable comforts. Like the rafts they steered to Pittsburg and the\r\nwild beasts they hunted, most of these brave fellows have drifted away\r\nnever to return.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERICK CROCKER.]\r\n\r\nSix-hundred inhabitants dwelt peacefully at Bradford ten years after the\r\nPithole bubble had been blown and pricked. The locomotive and track of a\r\nbranch of the Erie Railroad had supplanted A. W. Newell’s rude engine,\r\nwhich transported small loads to and from Carrollton. An ancient coach,\r\nweather-beaten and worm-eaten, sufficed for the scanty passenger-traffic\r\nand the quiet borough bade fair to stay in the old rut indefinitely. The\r\ncollection of frames labeled Tarport—a suit of tar and feathers\r\npresented to a frisky denizen begot the name—snuggled on a muddy road a\r\nmile northward. Seven miles farther, at Limestone, the “spirits”\r\ndirected Job Moses to buy ten-thousand acres of land. He bored a\r\nhalf-dozen shallow wells in 1864, getting some oil and gas. Jonathan\r\nWatson skirmished two miles east of Limestone, finding slight tinges of\r\ngreasiness. A mile south-west of Moses the Crosby well was dry. Another\r\nmile south the Olmsted well, on the Crooks farm, struck a vein of oil at\r\nnine-hundred feet and flowed twenty barrels on July fourteenth, 1875.\r\nThe sand was poor and dry-holes south and west augured ill for the\r\nterritory. Frederick Crocker drilled a duster early in 1875 on the\r\nKingsbury lands, east side of Tuna Creek. He had grit and experience and\r\nleased an angular piece of ground formed by a bend of the creek for his\r\nsecond venture. It was part of the Watkins farm, a mile above Tarport. A\r\nhalf-mile south-west, on the Hinchey farm, the Foster Oil-Company had\r\nsunk a twenty-barrel well in 1872, which somehow passed unnoticed. On\r\nSeptember twenty-sixth, 1875, from a shale and slate at nine-hundred\r\nfeet, the Crocker well flowed one-hundred-and-seventy barrels. This\r\nopened the gay ball which was to transmute the Tuna Valley from its\r\narcadian simplicity to the intense bustle of the grandest\r\npetroleum-region the world has ever known. The valley soon echoed and\r\nre-echoed the music of the tool-dresser and rig-builder and the click of\r\nthe drill as well as the vigorous profanity of the imported teamster.\r\nFrederick Crocker, who drilled on Oil Creek in 1860 and devised the\r\nvalve which kept the Empire well alive, had won another victory and the\r\ngreat Bradford field was born. He lived at Titusville fifteen years,\r\nerected the home afterwards occupied by Dr. W. B. Roberts, sold his\r\nBradford property, operated in the Washington district and died at\r\nIdlewild on February twenty-second, 1895. Mr. Crocker possessed real\r\ngenius, decision and the qualities which “from the nettle danger pluck\r\nthe flower success.” Active to the close of his long and useful\r\neighty-three years, he met death calmly and was laid to rest in the\r\ncemetery at Titusville.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the Crocker well tanked its initial spurt ere “the fun grew\r\nfast and furious.” Rigs multiplied like rabbits in Australia.\r\nTrain-loads of lively delegates from every nook and cranny of Oildom\r\ncrowded the streets, overran the hotels and taxed the commissary of the\r\nvillage to the utmost. Town-lots sold at New-York prices and buildings\r\nspread into the fields. At B. C. Mitchell’s Bradford House, headquarters\r\nof the oil-fraternity, operators and land-holders met and drillers “off\r\ntour” solaced their craving for “the good things of this life” playing\r\nbilliards and practising at the hotel-bar. Hundreds of big contracts\r\nwere closed in the second-story room where Lewis Emery, “Judge” Johnson,\r\nDr. Book and the advance-guard of the invading hosts assembled. Main\r\nstreet blazed at night with the light of dram-shops and the gaieties\r\nincidental to a full-fledged frontier-town. Noisy bands appealed to\r\nlovers of varieties to patronize barnlike-theatres, strains of syren\r\nmusic floated from beer-gardens, dance-halls of dubious complexion were\r\nthronged and gambling-dens ran unmolested. The free-and-easy air of the\r\ncommunity, too intent chasing oil and cash to bother about morality,\r\ncaptivated the ordinary stranger and gained “Bad Bradford” notoriety as\r\na combination of Pithole and Petroleum Centre, with a dash of Sodom and\r\nPandemonium, condensed into a single package. In February of 1879 a\r\ncity-charter was granted and James Broder was elected mayor. Radical\r\nreforms were not instituted with undue haste, to jar the sensitive\r\nfeelings of the incongruous masses gathered from far and near. Their\r\naccommodating nature at last adapted itself to a new state of affairs\r\nand accepted gracefully the restrictions imposed for the general\r\nwelfare. Checked temporarily by the Bullion spasm in 1876-7, the influx\r\nredoubled as the lower country waned. Fires merely consumed\r\nframe-structures to hasten the advent of costly brick-blocks. Ten\r\nchurches, schools, five banks, stores, hotels, three newspapers,\r\nstreet-cars, miles of residences and fifteen-thousand of the liveliest\r\npeople on earth attested the permanency of Bradford’s boom. Narrow-gauge\r\nrailroads circled the hills, traversed spider-web trestles and brought\r\ntribute to the city from the outlying districts. The area of\r\noil-territory seemed interminable. It reached in every direction, until\r\nfrom sixteen-thousand mouths seventy-five thousand acres poured their\r\nliquid treasure. The daily production waltzed to one-hundred-thousand\r\nbarrels! Iron-tanks were built by the thousand to store the surplus\r\ncrude. Two, three or four-thousand-barrel gushers were lacking, but\r\nwells that yielded twenty-five to two-hundred littered the slopes and\r\nvalleys. The field was a marvel, a phenomenon, a revelation. Bradford\r\npassed the mushroom-stage safely and was not snuffed out when\r\ndevelopments receded and the floaters wandered south in quest of fresh\r\nexcitement. To-day it is a thriving railroad and manufacturing centre,\r\nthe home of ten-thousand intelligent, independent, go-ahead citizens,\r\nproud of its past, pleased with its present and confident of its future.\r\n\r\nTo trace operations minutely would be an endless task. Crocker sold a\r\nhalf-interest in his well and drilled on an adjacent farm. Gillespie,\r\nBuchanan & Kelly came from Fagundas in 1874 and sank the two Fagundas\r\nwells—twenty and twenty-five barrels—a half-mile west of Crocker, in the\r\nfall and winter. Butts No. 1, a short distance north, actually flowed\r\nsixty barrels in November of 1874. Jackson & Walker’s No. 1, on the\r\nKennedy farm, north edge of town, on July seventeenth, 1875, flowed\r\ntwenty barrels at eleven-hundred feet. The dark, pebbly sand, the best\r\ntapped in McKean up to that date, encouraged the belief of better strata\r\ndown the Tuna. On December first, two months after Crocker’s strike, the\r\nyield of the Bradford district was two-hundred-and-ten barrels. The\r\nCrocker was doing fifty, the Olmsted twenty-five, the Butts fifteen, the\r\nJackson & Walker twenty and all others from one to six apiece. The oil,\r\ndark-colored and forty-five gravity, was loaded on Erie cars direct from\r\nthe wells, most of which were beside the tracks. The Union Company\r\nfinished the first pipe-line and pumped oil to Olean the last week of\r\nNovember. Prentice, Barbour & Co. were laying a line through the\r\ndistrict and 1875 closed with everything ripe for the millenium these\r\nglimmerings foreshadowed.\r\n\r\nLewis Emery, richly dowered with Oil-Creek experience and the\r\nget-up-and-get quality that forges to the front, was an early arrival at\r\nBradford. He secured the Quintuple tract of five-thousand acres and\r\ndrilled a test well on the Tibbets farm, three miles south of town. Its\r\nsuccess confirmed his judgment of the territory and began the wonderful\r\nQuintuple development. The Quintuple rained staying wells on the lucky,\r\nplucky graduate from Pioneer, quickly placing him in the\r\nmillionaire-class. He built blocks and refineries, opened an immense\r\nhardware-store, constructed pipe-lines, established a daily-paper,\r\nserved two terms in the Senate and opposed the Standard “tooth and\r\ntoe-nail.” Thoroughly earnest, he champions a cause with unflinching\r\ntenacity. He owns a big ranche in Dakota, big lumber-tracts and\r\nsaw-mills in Kentucky, a big oil-production and a big share in the\r\nUnited-States Pipe-Line. He has traveled over Europe, inspected the\r\nRussian oil-fields and gathered in his private museum the rarest\r\ncollection of curiosities and objects of interests in the state. Senator\r\nEmery is a staunch friend, a fighter who “doesn’t know when he is\r\nwhipped,” liberal, progressive, fluent in conversation and firm in his\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\n                  “A prince can mak’ a belted knight,\r\n                      A marquis, duke and a’ that;\r\n                  But an honest man’s aboon his might—\r\n                      Guid faith, he maunna fa’ that.”\r\n\r\nHon. David Kirk sticks faithfully to Emery in his hard-sledding to array\r\npetroleumites against the Standard. He manages the McCalmont\r\nOil-Company, which operated briskly in the Forest pools, at Bradford and\r\nRichburg. Mr. Kirk is a rattling speaker, positive in his sentiments and\r\nfrank in expressing his views. He extols Pennsylvania petroleum, backs\r\nthe outside pipe-lines and is an influential leader of the Producers’\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nDr. W. P. Book, who started at Plumer, ran big hotels at Parker and\r\nMillerstown and punched a hole in the Butler field occasionally, leased\r\nnine-hundred acres below Bradford in the summer of 1875. He bored\r\ntwo-hundred wells, sold the whole bundle to Captain J. T. Jones and went\r\nto Washington Territory with eight-hundred-thousand dollars to engage in\r\nlumbering and banking. Captain Jones landed on Oil Creek after the war,\r\nin which he was a brave soldier, and drilled thirteen dry-holes at\r\nRouseville! Repulses of this stripe would wear out most men, but the\r\nCaptain had enlisted for the campaign and proposed to stand by his guns\r\nto the last. His fourteenth attempt—a hundred-barreler on the Shaw\r\nfarm—recouped former losses and inaugurated thirty years of remarkable\r\nprosperity. Fortune smiled upon him in the Clarion field. Pipe-lines,\r\noil-wells, dealings in the exchanges, whatever he touched turned into\r\ngold. Not handicapped by timid partners, he paddled his own canoe and\r\nbecame the largest individual operator in the northern region. Acquiring\r\ntracts that proved to be the heart of the Sistersville field, he is\r\ncredited with rejecting an offer last year of five-million dollars for\r\nhis West-Virginia and Pennsylvania properties! From thirteen wells, good\r\nonly for post-holes if they could be dug up and retailed by the foot, to\r\nfive-millions in cash was a pretty stretch onward and upward. He\r\npreferred staying in the harness to the obscurity of a mere\r\ncoupon-clipper. He lives at Buffalo, controls his business, enjoys his\r\nmoney, remembers his legions of old friends and does not put on airs\r\nbecause of marching very near the head of the oleaginous procession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                -THEO BARNSDALL-\r\n          -LEWIS EMERY-\r\n  DAVID KIRK             CAPT. J. T. JONES\r\n]\r\n\r\nTheodore Barnsdall has never lagged behind since he entered the arena in\r\n1860. He operated on Oil Creek and has been a factor in every important\r\ndistrict. Marcus Hulings, reasoning that a paying belt intersected it\r\ndiagonally, secured the Clark & Babcock tract of six-thousand acres on\r\nFoster Brook, north-east of Bradford. Hundreds of fine wells verified\r\nhis theory and added a half-million to his bank-account. Sitting\r\nbeside me on a train one day in 1878, Mr. Hulings refused\r\nthree-hundred-thousand dollars, offered by Marcus Brownson, for his\r\ninterest in the property. He projected the narrow-gauge railroad from\r\nBradford to Olean and a bevy of oil-towns—Gillmor, Derrick City, Red\r\nRock and Bell’s Camp—budded and bloomed along the route. Frederic\r\nPrentice built pipe-lines and tanks, leased a half-township, started\r\nthirty wells in a week on the Melvin farm and organized the Producers’\r\nConsolidated Land-and-Petroleum-Company, big in name, in quality and in\r\ncapital. The American Oil-Company’s big operations wafted the late W. A.\r\nPullman a million and the presidency of the Seaboard Bank in New York,\r\nfilled Joseph Seep’s stocking and saddled a hundred-thousand dollars on\r\nJames Amm. The Hazlewood Oil-Company, guided by Bateman Goe’s prudent\r\nhand, drilled five-hundred wells and counted its gains in columns of six\r\nfigures. Robert Leckey, a first-class man from head to foot, was a royal\r\nwinner. Frederick Boden—true-blue, clear-grit, sixteen ounces to the\r\npound—forsook Corry to extract a stream of wealth from the Borden lands,\r\nsix miles east of Tarport. Prompt, square and manly, he merited the good\r\nluck that rewarded him in Pennsylvania and followed him to Ohio, where\r\nfor four years he has been operating extensively. Boden’s wells boosted\r\nthe territory east and north. From its junction with the Tuna at\r\nTarport—Kendall is the post-office—to its source off in the hills,\r\nKendall Creek steamed and smoked. Tarport expanded to the proportions of\r\na borough. Two narrow-gauge roads linked Bradford and Eldred, Sawyer\r\nCity, Rew City, Coleville, Rixford and Duke Centre—oil-towns in all the\r\nterm implies—keeping the rails from rusting. Other narrow-gauges\r\ndiverged to Warren, Mt. Jewett and Smethport. The Erie extended its\r\nbranch south and the Rochester & Pittsburg crossed the Kinzua gorge over\r\nthe highest railway viaduct—three-hundred feet—in this nation of tall\r\nprojects and tall achievements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BATEMAN GOE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FREDERICK BODEN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT LECKEY.]\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine years ago a stout-hearted, strong-limbed, wiry youth, fresh\r\nfrom the Emerald Isle, asked a man at Petroleum Centre for a job. Given\r\na pick and shovel, he graded a tank-bottom deftly and swiftly. He dug,\r\npulled tubing, drove team and earned money doing all sorts of chores.\r\nReared in poverty, he knew the value of a dollar and saved his pennies.\r\nTo him Oildom, with its “oil-princes”—George K. Anderson, Jonathan\r\nWatson, Dr. M. C. Egbert, David Yanney, Sam Woods, Joel Sherman and the\r\nPhillips Brothers were in their glory—was a golden dream. He learned to\r\n“run engine,” dress tools, twist the temper-screw and handle drilling\r\nand pumping-wells expertly. Although neither a prohibitionist nor a\r\nprude, he never permitted mountain-dew, giddy divinities in petticoats\r\nor the prevailing follies to get the better of him in his inordinate\r\ndesire for riches. Drop by drop for three years his frugal store\r\nincreased and he migrated to Parker early in the seventies. Such was the\r\nyoung man who “struck his gait” in the northern end of Armstrong county,\r\nwho was to outshine the men he may have envied on Oil Creek, to scoop\r\nthe biggest prize in the petroleum-lottery and weave a halo of\r\nglittering romance around the name of John McKeown.\r\n\r\nWorking an interest in an oil-well, he hit a paying streak and joined\r\nthe pioneers who had sinister designs on Butler county, proverbial for\r\n“buckwheat-batter” and “soap-mines.” At Lawrenceburg, a suburb of\r\nParker, he boarded with a comely widow, the mother of two bouncing kids\r\nand owner of a little cash. He married the landlady and five boys\r\nblessed the union of loyal hearts. His wife’s money aided him to develop\r\nthe Widow Nolan farm, east of the coal-bank near Millerstown. Regardless\r\nof Weller’s advice to “beware of vidders,” he wedded one and from\r\nanother obtained the lease of a farm on which his first well produced\r\none-hundred-and-fifty barrels a day for a year, a fortune in itself.\r\nThis was the beginning of McKeown’s giant strides. In partnership with\r\nWilliam Morrisey, a stalwart fellow-countryman—dead for years—he drilled\r\nat Greece City, Modoc and on the Cross-Belt. He held interests with\r\nParker & Thompson and James Goldsboro, played a lone hand at\r\nMartinsburg, invested in the Karns Pipe-Line and avoided speculation. He\r\nagreed with Thomas Hayes, of Fairview, in 1876, to operate in the\r\nBradford field. Hayes went ahead to grab a few tracts at Rixford,\r\nMcKeown remaining to dispose of his Butler properties. He sold every\r\nwell and every inch of land at top figures. No slave ever worked harder\r\nor longer hours than he had done to gain a firm footing. No task was too\r\ndifficult, no fatigue too severe, no undertaking too hazardous to be met\r\nand overcome. Avarice steeled his heart and hardened his muscles.\r\nWrapped in a rubber-coat and wearing the slouch-hat everybody\r\nrecognized, he would ride his powerful bay-horse knee-deep in mud or\r\nsnow at all hours of the night. It was his ambition to be the leading\r\noil-operator of the world. While putting money into Baltimore blocks,\r\nbank-stocks and western ranches, he always retained enough to gobble a\r\nslice of seductive oil-territory. Plunging into the northern field\r\n“horse, foot and dragoons,” he bought out Hayes, who returned to\r\nFairview with a snug nest-egg, and captured a huge chunk of the Bingham\r\nlands. Robert Simpson, agent of the Bingham estate, fancied the bold,\r\nresolute son of Erin and let him pick what he wished from the\r\nfifty-thousand acres under his care. McKeown selected many juicy tracts,\r\non which he drilled up a large production, sold portions at excessive\r\nprices and cleared at least a million dollars in two or three years! As\r\nBradford declined he turned his gaze towards the Washington district,\r\nbought a thousand acres of land and at the height of the excitement had\r\nten-thousand barrels of oil a day! His object had been attained and John\r\nMcKeown was the largest oil-producer in the universe.\r\n\r\nDown in Washington, as in Butler and McKean, he attended personally to\r\nhis wells, hired the workmen, negotiated for all materials and managed\r\nthe smallest details. He removed his family to the county-seat and lived\r\nin a plain, matter-of-fact way. It had been his intention to erect a\r\nforty-thousand-dollar house and reside at Jamestown, N. Y. Ground was\r\npurchased and the foundation laid. The local papers spoke of the\r\nacquisition he would be to the town, one suggesting to haul him into\r\npolitics and municipal improvements, and McKeown resented the notoriety\r\nby pulling up stakes and locating at Washington. It often amused me to\r\nhear him denounce the papers for calling him rich. He was more at home\r\nin a derrick than in a drawing-room. The din of the tools boring for\r\npetroleum was sweeter to his ears than “Lohengrin” or “The Blue Danube.”\r\nWatching oil streaming from his wells delighted his eye more than a\r\nCorot or a Meissonier in a gilt frame. For claw-hammer coats, tooth-pick\r\nshoes and vulgar show he had no earthly use. Democratic in his habits\r\nand speech, he heard the poor man as patiently as the banker or the\r\nschemer with a “soft snap.” Clothes counted for nothing in his judgment\r\nof people. He enjoyed the hunt for riches more than the possession. In\r\nno sense a liberal man, sometimes he thawed out to friends who got on\r\nthe sunny side of his frosty nature and wrote checks for church or\r\ncharity. Hard work was his diversion, his chief happiness. His wells and\r\nlands and income grew to dimensions it would have strained the nerves\r\nand brains of a half-dozen men to supervise. He had mortgaged his robust\r\nconstitution by constant exposure and the foreclosure could not always\r\nbe postponed. Repeated warnings were unheeded and the strong man broke\r\ndown just when he most needed the vitality his lavish drafts exhausted.\r\nEminent physicians hurried from Pittsburg and Philadelphia to his\r\nrelief, but the paper had gone to protest and on Sunday forenoon,\r\nFebruary eighth, 1891, at the age of fifty-three, John McKeown passed\r\ninto eternity. Father Hendrich administered the last rites to the dying\r\nman. He sank into a comatose state and his death was painless. The\r\nremains were interred in the Catholic cemetery at Lawrenceville, in\r\npresence of a great multitude that assembled to witness the curtain fall\r\non the most eventful life in the oil-regions.\r\n\r\nOne touching little tale about McKeown, which might adorn the pages of a\r\nSunday-school library, has drifted out of Bradford. Landing on the\r\nplatform of the dilapidated Erie-Railroad station, upon his first visit\r\nto the metropolis of mud and oil, John McKeown, wearing his greasiest\r\nsuit, asked a group of boys to direct him to the Parker House. “I’ll\r\ntell you for a quarter,” said one. “I’ll show you where it is for ten\r\ncents,” chimed in another. “Say, I’ll do it for five cents,” remarked a\r\nthird. “Mister,” said bright-eyed Jimmie Duffy, “I will show you the\r\nplace for nothing.” So the stranger went with Jimmie. He took the lad to\r\na clothing-store, arrayed him sumptuously in the best hand-me-downs that\r\nBradford could afford and sent the boy away with a five-dollar\r\ngold-piece. Jimmie bought a shoeblack-outfit and began to “shine ’em up”\r\nat ten cents a clip. His good work, cheerfulness and ready wit brought\r\nhim many a quarter. Soon he hired a number of assistants, built a\r\n“parlor,” controlled every stand in town and at nineteen went west with\r\nseven-thousand dollars in his pockets. Jimmie Duffie’s luck set all the\r\nBradford urchins to lying in wait for strangers in greasy garments lined\r\nwith gold-pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN MCKEOWN.]\r\n\r\nEstimates of McKeown’s wealth ranged from three-millions to ten. A guess\r\nmidway would probably be near the mark. When asked by Dun or Bradstreet\r\nhow he should be rated, his invariable answer was: “I pay cash for all I\r\nget.” O. D. Bleakley, of Franklin, was appointed guardian of the sons\r\nand Hon. J. W. Lee is Mrs. McKeown’s legal adviser. The oldest boy has\r\nmarried, has received his share of the estate and is spending it freely.\r\nA younger son was drowned in a pond at the school to which his mother\r\nsent the bright lad. Once McKeown, desiring to have Dr. Agnew’s candid\r\nopinion at the lowest cost, put on his poorest garb and secured a rigid\r\nexamination upon his promise to pay the great Philadelphia practitioner\r\nten dollars “as soon as he could earn the money.” He thanked the doctor,\r\nreturned in a business-suit, told of the ruse he had adopted and\r\ncemented the acquaintance with a check for one-hundred dollars. In\r\nBaltimore he posed as a hayseed at a forced sale of property the\r\nmortgagors calculated to bid in at a fraction of its value. He deposited\r\na million dollars in a city-bank and appeared at the sale in the old\r\nsuit and slouched hat he had packed in his satchel for the occasion.\r\nStylish bidders at first ignored the seedy fellow whose winks to the\r\nauctioneer elevated the price ten-thousand dollars a wink. One of them\r\nhinted to the stranger that he might be bidding beyond his limit. “I\r\nguess not,” replied John, “I pay cash for what I get.” The property was\r\nknocked down to him for about six-hundred-thousand dollars. He requested\r\nthe attorney to telephone to the bank whether his check would be\r\nhonored. “Good for a million!” was the response. Now his triumphs and\r\nhis spoils have shrunk to the little measure of the grave!\r\n\r\n           “Through the weary night on his couch he lay\r\n           With the life-tide ebbing fast away.\r\n           When the tide goes out from the sea-girt lands\r\n           It bears strange freight from the gleaming sands:\r\n           The white-winged ships, which long may wait\r\n           For the foaming wave and the wind that’s late;\r\n           The treasures cast on a rock-bound shore\r\n           From stranded ships that shall sail no more,\r\n           And hopes that follow the shining seas—\r\n           Oh! the ocean wide shall win all these.\r\n           But saddest of all that drift to the sea\r\n           Is the human soul to eternity,\r\n           Floating away from a silent shore,\r\n           Like a fated ship, to return no more.”\r\n\r\nThe Bradford Oil-Company—J. T. Jones, Wesley Chambers, L. G. Peck and L.\r\nF. Freeman were the principal stockholders—owned a good share of the\r\nland on which Greater Bradford was built and ten-thousand acres in the\r\nnorthern field. The company drilled three-hundred wells in McKean and\r\nAllegany, realized fifty-thousand dollars from city-lots and its stock\r\nrose to two-thousand dollars a share. In 1881 Captain Jones bought out\r\nhis copartners. The Enterprise Transit-Company, managed by John Brown,\r\nachieved reputation and currency. The McCalmont Oil-Company—organized\r\nduring the Bullion phantom by David Kirk, I. E. Dean, Tack Brothers and\r\nF. A. Dilworth—humped itself in the middle and northern fields,\r\nsometimes paying three-hundred-thousand dollars a year in dividends.\r\nKirk & Dilworth founded Great Belt City, in Butler county, cutting up a\r\nfarm and selling hundreds of lots. “Farmer” Dean, manager of the\r\ncompany, operated in the lower fields, lived two years at Richburg,\r\ntoured the country to preach the gospel according to the Greenbackers\r\nand won laurels on the rostrum. Frank Tack—frank and trustworthy—was\r\nvice-president of the New-York Oil-Exchange and his brother is dead. The\r\nEmery Oil-Company, the Quintuple, Mitchell & Jones, Whitney & Wheeler,\r\nMelvin and Fuller, George H. Vanvleck, George V. Forman, John L.\r\nMcKinney & Co., Isaac Willets and Peter T. Kennedy were shining lights\r\nin the McKean-Allegany firmament. Kennedy owned the saw-mill when\r\nBradford was a lumber camp and his estate—he died at fifty—inventoried\r\neleven-hundred-thousand dollars. Hundreds of small operators left\r\nBradford happy as men should be with as much money as their wives could\r\nspend; other hundreds dumped their well-earnings into the insatiable maw\r\nof speculation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COL. JOHN J. CARTER.]\r\n\r\nThe Bradford field was young when Col. John J. Carter, of Titusville,\r\npaid sixty-thousand dollars for the Whipple farm, on Kendall Creek.\r\nFriends shook their heads over the purchase, up to that time the largest\r\nby a private individual in the district, but the farm produced\r\nfifteen-hundred-thousand barrels of oil and demonstrated the wisdom of\r\nthe deed. Other properties were developed by this indefatigable worker,\r\nuntil his production was among the largest in the northern region and he\r\ncould have sold at a price to number him with the millionaires.\r\nUnanimously chosen president of the Bradford, Bordell & Kinzua\r\nRailroad-Company, he completed the line in ninety days from the issue of\r\nthe charter and in eighteen months returned the stockholders eighty per\r\ncent. in dividends. President Carter’s ability in handling the property\r\nsaved it to its owners, while every other narrow-gauge in the system\r\nfell into the clutches of receivers or sold as junk to meet\r\ncourt-charges for costly litigation.\r\n\r\nAll “Old-Timers” remember the “Gentlemen’s Furnishing-House of John J.\r\nCarter,” the finest establishment of the kind west of New York. Young\r\nCarter, with a splendid military record, located at Titusville in the\r\nsummer of 1865, immediately after being mustered out of the service, and\r\nengaged in mercantile pursuits ten years. Like other progressive men, he\r\ntook interests in the wild-cat ventures that made Pithole, Shamburg,\r\nPetroleum Centre and Pleasantville famous. From large holdings in\r\nVenango, Clarion and Forest he reaped a rich harvest. One tract of\r\nfour-thousand acres in Forest, purchased in 1886 and two-thirds of it\r\nyet undrilled, he expects to hand down to his children as a proof of\r\ntheir father’s business-foresight. He scanned the petroleum-horizon\r\naround Pittsburg carefully and retained his investments in the middle\r\nand upper fields. Taylorstown and McDonald, with their rivers of oil,\r\nburst forth with the fury of a flood and disappeared. Sistersville, in\r\nWest Virginia, had given the trade a taste of its hidden treasures from\r\na few scattered wells. Much salt-water, little oil and deep drilling\r\ndiscouraged operators. How to produce oil at a profit, with such\r\nquantities of water to be pumped out, was the problem. Col. Carter\r\nvisited the scene, comprehended the situation, devised his plans and\r\nbought huge blocks of the choicest territory before the oil-trade\r\nthought Sistersville worth noticing. This bold stroke added to the value\r\nof every well and lease in West Virginia, inspired the faltering with\r\ncourage and rewarded him magnificently. Advancing prices rendered the\r\nprincely yield of his scores of wells immensely profitable. Purchases\r\nbased on fifty-cent oil—the trade had small faith in the outcome—he sold\r\non the basis of dollar-fifty oil. Col. Carter is in the prime of\r\nvigorous manhood, ready to explore new fields and surmount new\r\nobstacles. He occupies a beautiful home, has a superb library, is a\r\nthorough scholar and a convincing speaker. His recent argument before\r\nthe Ohio Legislature, in opposition to the proposed iniquitous tax on\r\ncrude-petroleum, was a masterpiece of effective, pungent, unanswerable\r\nlogic. None who admire a brave, manly, generous character will say that\r\nhis success is undeserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: O. P. TAYLOR.]\r\n\r\nFive townships six miles square—Independence, Willing, Alma, Bolivar and\r\nGenesee, with Andover, Wellsville, Scio, Wirt and Clarksville north—form\r\nthe southern border of Allegany county, New York. The first well bored\r\nfor oil in the county—the Honeyoe—was the Wellsville & Alma Oil\r\nCompany’s duster in Independence township, drilled eighteen-hundred feet\r\nin September, 1877. Gas at five-hundred feet caught fire and burned the\r\nrig, and signs of oil were found at one-thousand feet. The second was O.\r\nP. Taylor’s Pikeville well, Alma township, finished in November, 1878.\r\nTaylor, the father of the Allegany field, decided to try north of Alma,\r\nand in July of 1879 completed the Triangle No. 1, in Scio township, the\r\nfirst in Allegany to produce oil. It originated the Wellsville\r\nexcitement and first diverted public attention from Bradford. Triangle\r\nNo. 2, drilled early in 1880, pumped twelve barrels a day. S. S.\r\nLongabaugh, of Duke Centre, sank a dry-hole, the second well in Scio,\r\nthree miles north-east of Triangle No. 1. Operations followed rapidly.\r\nRichburg No. 1, Wirt township, in which Taylor enlisted three\r\nassociates, responded at a sixty barrel gait in May of 1881 to a huge\r\ncharge of glycerine. Samuel Boyle, who had struck the first big well at\r\nSawyer City, completed the second well at Richburg in June, manipulated\r\nit as a “mystery” and torpedoed it on July thirteenth. It flowed\r\nthree-hundred barrels of blue-black oil, forty-two gravity, from fifty\r\nfeet of porous sand and slate. Taylor’s exertions and perseverance\r\nshowed indomitable will, bravery and pluck. He was a Virginian by birth,\r\na Confederate soldier and a cigar-manufacturer at Wellsville. It is\r\nrelated that while drilling his first Triangle well the tools needed\r\nrepairs and he had not money to send them to Bradford. His Wellsville\r\nacquaintances seemed amazingly “short” when he attempted a loan. His\r\nwife had sold her watch to procure food and she gave him the cash. The\r\ntools were fixed, the well was completed and it started Taylor on the\r\nroad to the fortune he and his helpmeet richly earned. The pioneer died\r\nin the fall of 1883. The record of his adventures, trials and\r\ntribulations in opening a new oil-district would fill a volume. He was\r\nprepared for the message: “Child of Earth, thy labors and sorrows are\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nEighteen lively months sufficed to define the Allegany field, which was\r\nconfined to seven-thousand acres. Twenty-nine-hundred wells were bored\r\nand the maximum yield of the district was nineteen-thousand barrels.\r\nRichburg and Bolivar, both old villages, quadrupled their size in three\r\nmonths. Narrow-gauge railroads soon connected the new field with Olean,\r\nFriendship and Bradford. The territory was shallow in comparison with\r\nparts of McKean, where eighteen-hundred feet was not an uncommon depth\r\nfor wells. Timber and water were abundant, good roads presented a\r\npleasing contrast to the unfathomable mud of Clarion and Butler and the\r\ncountry was decidedly attractive. Efforts to find an outlet to the belt\r\nfailed in every instance. The climax had been reached and a gradual\r\ndecline set in. Allegany was the northern limit of remunerative\r\ndevelopments in the United States, which the next turn of the wheel once\r\nmore diverted southward. The McCalmont Oil-Company and Phillips Brothers\r\nwere leaders in the Richburg field. The country had been settled by\r\nSeventh-day Baptists, whose “Sunday was on Saturday.” Not to offend\r\nthese devout people by discriminating in favor of Sunday, operators\r\n“whipped the devil around the stump” by drilling and pumping their wells\r\nseven days a week!\r\n\r\nThe Chipmunk pool, a dozen miles north of Bradford, was trotted out in\r\n1895. For a season its shallow wells promised a glut of real oil, the\r\ndaily production rising to twenty-six-hundred barrels. The area of\r\ncreamy territory was quickly defined. Captain E. H. Barnum, long an\r\nenterprising Bradford operator, drilled a test-well near Arkwright,\r\nChautauqua County, N.Y., in 1897. He put twenty-five-hundred feet of\r\nsix-inch and three-hundred feet of eight-inch casing in the hole, which\r\nproved barren of oil or gas and was abandoned when three-thousand feet\r\ndeep. The Watsonville pool, south-west of Bradford, lively drilling\r\nbrought to the nine-thousand-barrel notch for a time this season.\r\n\r\nThe town of Ceres, which celebrated its one-hundredth birthday this\r\nyear, has had some peculiar experiences. Located on the state-line\r\nbetween New York and Pennsylvania, the boundary has figured in many\r\ncurious ways since the pioneers erected the first log-cabin in 1797. The\r\nfirst squabble related to the post-office, which was established on the\r\nsouth-side of the line, in Pennsylvania, with a basket to hold the mail.\r\nBy some hocus-pocus the department permitted the office to be removed to\r\nthe north-side, in New York, fifty or more years ago. Every President\r\nfrom Andrew Jackson to William McKinley has been importuned to change it\r\nback again, but the population is so nearly divided that the question\r\nbids fair, like Tennyson’s brook, “to go on forever.” Ceres was strictly\r\nin it as a Gretna Green. The little Methodist church, the only one in\r\nthe village, is built against the line, the porch extending into New\r\nYork. The parsonage is in the same fix. To avoid securing a license,\r\nPennsylvania couples had merely to step out of the parsonage to the\r\nporch and be married in New York. Eloping couples have had some lively\r\nrides to Ceres. For many years Justice Peabody was very popular at\r\nknot-tying. He was aroused one midnight by a man who wanted a warrant\r\nfor the arrest of a pair of elopers. The judge was friendly to the young\r\nfellow in love. As he was making out the papers a rap at the door\r\ninterrupted him. The caller was the young man himself. The judge stepped\r\noutside behind a stump-fence, across the state-line, married the eloping\r\ncouple and then returned to the house to finish making out the warrant.\r\nA hotel built by a bright genius close to the line had an addition for a\r\nbarroom. The barroom extended over the line and its sole entrance was\r\nfrom the Pennsylvania side. The bartender, by stepping a foot either way\r\nfrom the center of the bar, could pass from one state to another. He was\r\narrested for illegal selling many times, but in each instance he would\r\nswear that the whisky he sold was disposed of in the other state. One\r\nday a Pennsylvania prisoner slipped his handcuffs when the sheriff was\r\nnot looking, jumped out of the dining-room into New York, made faces at\r\nthe minion of the law and defied arrest. For fifty years state-pride\r\nkept the people apart on the school-question. They had a small\r\ndistrict-school on each side of the line in preference to a graded\r\nschool, because the latter would demand a surrender of state-pride. Four\r\nyears ago the differences were patched up and a graded-school was\r\nprovided. The engine of the steam saw-mill is in Pennsylvania and the\r\nboiler in New York. The logs enter the mill in Pennsylvania and are\r\nsawed in New York, the boards are edged in Pennsylvania and the lumber\r\nis piled up crosswise on the state-line. At the grist-mill the grain\r\nentered on the New-York side, was ground in Pennsylvania and carried\r\nback into New York by the bolting-machinery. When the oil-boom was on at\r\nBolivar and Richburg two narrow-gauge railroads passed through Ceres.\r\nOne station was in New York and the other in Pennsylvania, with tracks\r\nparallel to Bolivar. The schedules of the passenger-trains were alike\r\nand some of the fastest rides ever taken on a narrow-gauge road\r\nresulted. Oil-developments did not hit Ceres hard, wells around the tidy\r\nvillage failing to tap the greasy artery. Possibly Nature thought the\r\nfolks had enough fun over the boundary complications to compensate for\r\nthe lack of petroleum.\r\n\r\nCanada has oil-fields of considerable importance. The largest and oldest\r\nis in Enniskillen township, Lambton county, a dozen miles from Port\r\nSarnia, at the foot of Lake Huron. Black Creek, a small tributary of the\r\nDetroit river, flows through this township and for many years its waters\r\nhad been coated with a greasy liquid the Indians sold as a specific for\r\ncountless diseases. The precious commodity was of a brown color,\r\nexceedingly odorous, unpleasant to the taste and burned with great\r\nintensity. In 1860 several wells were started, the projectors believing\r\nthe floating oil indicated valuable deposits within easy reach of the\r\nsurface. James Williams, who had previously garnered the stuff in pits,\r\nfinished the first well that yielded oil in paying quantity. Others\r\nfollowed in close succession, but months passed without the sensation of\r\na genuine spouter. Late in the summer of the same year that operations\r\ncommenced, John Shaw, a poor laborer, managed to get a desirable lease\r\non the bank of the creek. He built a cheap rig, provided a spring-pole\r\nand “kicked down” a well, toiling all alone at his weary task until\r\nmoney and credit and courage were exhausted. Ragged, hungry and\r\nbarefooted, one forenoon he was refused boots and provisions by the\r\nvillage-merchant, nor would the blacksmith sharpen his drills without\r\ncash down. Reduced to the verge of despair, he went back to his derrick\r\nwith a heavy heart, ate a hard crust for dinner and decided to leave for\r\nthe United States next morning if no signs of oil were discovered that\r\nafternoon. He let down the tools and resumed his painful task. Twenty\r\nminutes later a rush of gas drove the tools high in the air, followed\r\nthe next instant by a column of oil that rose a hundred feet! The roar\r\ncould be heard a mile and the startled populace rushed from the\r\nneighboring hamlet to see the unexpected marvel. Canada boasted its\r\nfirst flowing-well and the tidings flew like wild-fire. Before dark\r\nhundreds of excited spectators visited the spot. For days the oil gushed\r\nunchecked, filling a natural basin an acre in extent, then emptying into\r\nthe creek and discoloring the waters as far down as Lake St. Clair. None\r\nknew how to regulate its output and bring the flow under control. Thus\r\nit remained a week, when a delegate from Pennsylvania showed the owner\r\nhow to put in a seed-bag and save the product. The first attempt\r\nsucceeded and thenceforth the oil was cared for properly. Opinions\r\ndiffer as to the actual production of this novel strike, although the\r\nbest judges placed it at five-thousand barrels a day for two or three\r\nweeks! The stream flowed incessantly the full size of the hole, a strong\r\npressure of gas forcing it out with wonderful speed. The well produced\r\ngenerously four months, when it “stopped for keeps.” Persons who visited\r\nthe well at its best will recall the surroundings. A pond of oil large\r\nenough for a respectable regatta lay between it and Black Creek, whose\r\ngreasy banks for miles bore traces of the lavish inundation of crude.\r\nThe locality was at once interesting and high-flavored and a conspicuous\r\nfeature was Shaw himself. Radiant in a fresh suit of store-clothes, he\r\nmoved about with the complacency incident to a green ruralist who has\r\n“struck ile.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN SHAW.]\r\n\r\nOne of the persons earliest on the ground after the well began to flow\r\nwas the storekeeper who had refused the proprietor a pair of boots that\r\nmorning. With the cringing servility of a petty retailer he hurried to\r\nembrace Shaw, coupling this outbreak of affection with the assurance\r\nthat everything in the shop was at his service. It is gratifying to note\r\nthat Shaw had the spirit to rebuke this puppyism. Bringing his ample\r\nfoot into violent contact with the dealer’s most vital part, he\r\naccompanied a heavy kick with an emphatic command to go to the place\r\nHeber Newton and Pentecost have ruled out. Shaw was uneducated and fell\r\na ready prey to sharpers on the watch for easy victims. Cargoes of oil\r\nshipped to England brought small returns and his sudden wealth slipped\r\naway in short order. Ere long the envied possessor of the big well was\r\nobliged to begin life anew. For a few years he struggled along as an\r\nitinerant photographer, traveling with a “car” and earning a precarious\r\nsubstance taking “tin-types.” Death closed the scene in 1872, the\r\nluckless pioneer expiring at Petrolea in absolute want. Thus sadly ended\r\nanother illustration of the adverse fortune which frequently overtakes\r\nmen whose energy and grit confer benefits upon mankind that surely\r\nentitle them to a better fate. Mr. Williams saved money, served in\r\nparliament and died in the city of Hamilton years ago. He was the\r\nintimate friend of Hon. Isaac Buchanan, the distinguished Canadian\r\nstatesman, whose sons are well-known operators at Oil City and\r\nPittsburg.\r\n\r\n              “The stars shall fade away, the sun himself\r\n              Grow dim with age and nature sink in years;\r\n              But thou shall flourish in immortal youth.”\r\n\r\nAs might be imagined, Shaw’s venture gave rise to operations of great\r\nmagnitude. Hosts flocked to the scene in quest of lands and developments\r\nbegan on an extensive scale. Among others a rig was built and a well\r\ndrilled without delay as close to the Shaw as it was possible to place\r\nthe timbers. The sand was soon reached by the aid of steam-power and\r\nonce more the oil poured forth enormously, the new strike proving little\r\ninferior to its neighbor. It was named the Bradley, in honor of the\r\nprincipal owner, E. C. Bradley, afterwards a leading operator in\r\nPennsylvania, president of the Empire Gas-Company and still a resident\r\nof Oildom. The yield continued large for a number of months, then ceased\r\nentirely and both wells were abandoned. Of the hundreds in the vicinity\r\na good percentage paid nicely, but none rivalled the initial spouters.\r\nThe influx of restless spirits led to an “oil-town,” which for a brief\r\nspace presented a picture of activity rarely surpassed. Oil Springs, as\r\nthe mushroom city was fittingly termed, flourished amazingly. The\r\nexcessive waste of oil filled every ditch and well, rendering the water\r\nunfit for use and compelling the citizens to quench their thirst with\r\nartificial drinks. The bulk of the oil was conveyed to Mandaumin,\r\nWyoming or Port Sarnia, over roads of horrible badness, giving\r\nemployment to an army of teamsters. A sort of “mud canal” was formed,\r\nthrough which the horses dragged small loads on a species of flat-boats,\r\nwhile the drivers walked along the “tow-path” on either side. The mud\r\nhad the consistency of thin batter and was seldom under three feet deep.\r\nTo those who have never seen this unique system of navigation the most\r\ngraphic description would fail to convey an adequate idea of its\r\npeculiar features. Unlike the Pennsylvania oil-fields, the\r\npetroleum-districts of Canada are low and swampy, a circumstance that\r\nadded greatly to the difficulty of moving the greasy staple during the\r\nwet season. Ultimately roads were cut through the soft morasses and\r\nrailways were constructed, although not before Oil Springs had seen its\r\nbest days and begun a rapid descent on the down grade. Salt-water\r\nquickly put a stop to many wells, the production declined rapidly and\r\nthe town was depopulated. Operations extended towards the north-west,\r\nwhere Petrolea, which is yet a flourishing place, was established in\r\n1864. Bothwell, twenty-six miles south of Oil Springs, had a short\r\ncareer and light production. Canadian operators were slower than the\r\nYankees of the period and the tireless push of the Americans who crowded\r\nto the front at the beginning of the developments around Oil Springs was\r\na revelation to the quiet plodders of Enniskillen and adjacent\r\ntownships. The leading refineries are at London, fifty miles east of\r\nWyoming and one of the most attractive cities in the Dominion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OIL ON THE\r\n  PENINSULA OF GASPE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nPetroleum has long been known to exist in considerable quantity in the\r\nGaspe Peninsula, at the extreme eastern end of Quebec. The Petroleum\r\nOil-Trust, organized by a bunch of Canadians to operate the district,\r\nput down eight wells in 1893, finding a light green oil. The Trust\r\ncontinued its borings in 1894, on the left bank of the York River, south\r\nof the anticlinal of Tar Point. Several of the ten wells yielded\r\nmoderately, and operations extended to the portion of Gaspe Basin called\r\nMississippi Brook. One well in that section, completed in July of 1897,\r\nflowed from a depth of fifteen-hundred feet. Hundreds of barrels were\r\nlost before the well could be controlled. Its first, pumping produced\r\nforty barrels, and two others in the vicinity are of a similar stripe.\r\nThe results thus far are deemed sufficiently encouraging to warrant\r\nfurther tests in hope of developing an extensive field. The oil comes\r\nfrom a coarse rock of sandy texture, and in color and gravity resembles\r\nthe Pennsylvania article. The formation around the newest strikes is\r\nnearly flat, while the shallow wells in the section first prospected\r\nwere bored at a sharp angle, to keep in touch with the dip of the rock,\r\njust as diamond drills follow the gold-bearing ledges in the Black Hills\r\nof South Dakota. Crossing the continent, oil has been tapped in the\r\ngold-diggings of British Columbia, although in amounts too small to be\r\nimportant commercially.\r\n\r\nJohn Shaw, whose gusher brought the “gum-beds” of Enniskillen into the\r\npetroleum-column, narrowly escaped anticipating Drake three years. Shaw\r\nremoved from Massachusetts to Canada in 1838, and was regarded as a\r\nvisionary schemer. In 1856 he sought to interest his neighbors in a plan\r\nto _drill a well through the rock_ in search of the reservoir that\r\nsupplied Bear Creek with a thick scum of oil. They hooted at the idea\r\nand proposed to send Shaw to the asylum. This tabooed the subject and\r\npostponed the advent of petroleum until the end of August, 1859.\r\n\r\nNot content to crown Alaska with mountains of gold and valleys of yellow\r\nnuggets, inventors of choice fables have invested the hyperborean region\r\nwith an exhaustless store of petroleum. In July of 1897 this paragraph,\r\ndated Seattle, went the rounds of the press:\r\n\r\n“What is said to be the greatest discovery ever made is reported from\r\nAlaska. Some gold-prospectors several months ago ran across what seemed\r\nto be a lake of oil. It was fed by innumerable springs and the\r\nsurrounding mountains were full of coal. They brought supplies to\r\nSeattle and tests proved it to be of as high grade as any ever taken out\r\nof Pennsylvania wells. A local company was formed and experts sent up.\r\nThey have returned on the steamer Topeka, and their report has more than\r\nborne out first reports. It is stated there is enough oil and coal in\r\nthe discovery to supply the world. It is close to the ocean; in fact,\r\nthe experts say that the oil oozes out into the salt-water.”\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Seward’s purchase from Russia, for years ridiculed as good\r\nonly for icebergs and white-bears, may be credited with Klondyke placers\r\nand vast bodies of gold-bearing quartz, but a “lake of oil” is too great\r\na stretch of the long bow. If “a lake of oil” ever existed, the lighter\r\nportions would have evaporated and the residue would be asphaltum. The\r\nstory “won’t hold water” or oil.\r\n\r\nA thief broke into a Bradford store and pilfered the cash-drawer. Some\r\nmonths later the merchant received an unsigned letter, containing a\r\nten-dollar bill and this explanatory note: “I stole seventy-eight\r\ndollars from your money-drawer. Remorse gnaws at my conscience. When\r\nremorse gnaws again I will send you some more.”\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that evil travels faster than good, since it takes\r\nonly two seconds to fight a duel and two months to drill an oil-well at\r\nBradford.\r\n\r\n“The Producers’ Consolidated Land-and-Petroleum-Company,” the formidable\r\ntitle over the Bradford office of the big corporation, is apt to suggest\r\nto observant readers the days of old long sign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REUBEN CARROLL.]\r\n\r\nHon. Reuben Carroll, a pioneer-operator, was born in Mercer county in\r\n1823, went to Ohio to complete his education, settled in the Buckeye\r\nState, and was a member of the Legislature when developments began on\r\nOil Creek. Solicited by friends to join them in an investment that\r\nproved fortunate, he removed to Titusville and cast his lot with the\r\nproducers. He operated extensively in the northern fields, residing at\r\nRichburg during the Allegheny excitement. He took an active interest in\r\npublic affairs, and contributed stirring articles on politics, finance\r\nand good government to leading journals. He opposed Wall-street\r\ndomination and vigorously upheld the rights of the masses. Upon the\r\ndecline of Richburg he located at Lily Dale, New York. As a\r\nrepresentative producer he was asked to become a member of the South\r\nImprovement-Company in 1872. The offer aroused his inflexible sense of\r\njustice and was indignantly spurned. He knew the sturdy quality and\r\nlarge-heartedness of the Oil-Creek operators and did not propose to\r\nassist in their destruction. At seventy-four, Mr. Carroll is vigorous\r\nand well-preserved, ready to combat error and champion truth with tongue\r\nand pen. An intelligent student of the past and of current events, a\r\nclose observer of the signs of the times and a keen reasoner, Reuben\r\nCarroll is a fine example of the men who are mainly responsible for the\r\nbirth and growth of the petroleum-development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RALPH W. CARROLL.]\r\n\r\nThere is much uncertainty as to the youngest soldier in the civil-war,\r\nthe oldest Mason, the man who first nominated McKinley for President,\r\nand who struck Billie Patterson, but none as to the youngest dealer in\r\noil-well supplies in the oil-region. This distinction belongs to Ralph\r\nW. Carroll, a native of Youngstown, Ohio, and son of Hon. Reuben\r\nCarroll. Born in 1860, at eighteen he was at the head of a large\r\nbusiness at Rock City, in the Four-Mile District, five miles south-west\r\nof Olean. Three brothers were associated with him. The firm was the\r\nfirst to open a supply-store at Richburg, with a branch at Allentown,\r\nfour miles east, and an establishment later at Cherry Grove. In 1883\r\nRalph W. succeeded the firm, his brothers retiring, and located at\r\nBradford. In 1886 he opened offices and warehouses at Pittsburg and in\r\n1894 removed to New York to engage in placing special investments. The\r\nyoung merchant was secretary of the Producers’ Protective Association,\r\norganized at Richburg in 1891, and a member of the executive committee\r\nthat conducted the fight against the Roberts Torpedo-Company. Hon. David\r\nKirk, Asher W. Milner, J. E. Dusenbury and “Farmer” Dean were his four\r\nassociates on this important committee. Roscoe Conkling, for the Roberts\r\nside, and General Butler, for the Producers’ Association, measured\r\nswords in this legal warfare. Mr. Carroll has a warm welcome for his\r\noil-region friends, a class of men the like of whom for geniality,\r\nsociability, liberality and enterprise the world can never duplicate.\r\n\r\nThe Beardsleys, Fishers, Dollophs and Fosters were the first inhabitants\r\nin the wilds of Northern McKean. Henry Bradford Dolloph, whose house\r\nabove Sawyer City was shattered by a glycerine-explosion, was the first\r\nwhite child who saw daylight and made infantile music in the Tuna\r\nValley. One of the first two houses where Bradford stands was occupied\r\nby the Hart family, parents and twelve children. When the De Golias\r\nsettled up the East Branch a road had to be cut through the forest from\r\nAlton. Hon. Lewis Emery’s No. 1, on the Tibbets farm, the first good\r\nwell up the Branch, produced oil that paid two or three times the cost\r\nof the entire property.\r\n\r\nThe United-States Pipe-Line has overcome legal obstructions, laid its\r\ntubes under railroads that objected to its passage to the sea and will\r\nsoon pump oil direct to refineries on the Jersey coast. Senator Emery,\r\nthe sponsor of the line, is not the man to be bluffed by any\r\nrailroad-popinjay who wants him to get off the earth. The\r\nNational-Transit Line has ample facilities to transport all the oil in\r\nPennsylvania to the seaboard, but Emery is a true descendant of the\r\nproud Highlander who wouldn’t sail in Noah’s ark because “ilka McLean\r\nhas a boat o’ his ain.” He was born in New-York State, reared in\r\nMichigan, whither the family removed in his boyhood, and learned to be a\r\nmiller. Arriving at Pioneer early in the sixties, he cut his eye-teeth\r\nas an oil-operator on Oil Creek and had much to do with bringing the\r\ngreat Bradford district to the front. He served one term in the\r\nLegislature and two in the Senate, gaining a high reputation by his\r\nfearless opposition to jobbery and corruption.\r\n\r\nMichael Garth, a keen-witted son of the Emerald Isle, has the easiest\r\nsnap in the northern region. Scraping together the funds to put down a\r\nwell on his rocky patch of ground near Duke Centre, he rigged a\r\nwater-wheel to pump the ten barrels of crude the strike yielded daily.\r\nAnother well of similar stripe was drilled and the faithful creek drives\r\nthe wooden-wheel night and day, without one cent of expense or one\r\nparticle of attention on the part of the owner. Garth can go fishing\r\nthree days at a lick, to find the wells producing upon his return just\r\nas when he left. Such a picnic almost compels a man to be lazy.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian Oil Company, of which Charles E. Collins is the\r\nclear-brained president and guiding star, has operated on the wholesale\r\nplan in the northern region and in West Virginia. In October of 1897 the\r\nDevonian, the Watson and the Emery companies sold a part of their\r\nholdings north and south to the West Penn, a producing wing of the\r\nStandard, for fourteen-hundred-thousand dollars in spot cash. The\r\nlargest cash sale of wells and territory on record, this transaction was\r\nnegotiated by John L. and J. C. McKinney acting in behalf of the buyer,\r\nand Charles E. Collins and Lewis Emery representing the sellers.\r\n\r\n“Hell in harness!” Davy Crockett is credited with exclaiming the first\r\ntime he saw a railroad train tearing along one dark night. Could he have\r\nseen an oil-train on the Oil-Creek Railroad, blazing from end to end and\r\ntearing down from Brocton at sixty miles an hour, the conception would\r\nhave been yet more realistic. Engineer Brown held the throttle, which he\r\npulled wide open upon discovering a car of crude on fire. Mile after\r\nmile he sped on, thick smoke and sheets of flame each moment growing\r\ndenser and fiercer. At last he reached a long siding, slackened the\r\nspeed for the fireman to open the switch and ran the doomed train off\r\nthe main track. He detached the engine and two cars, while the rest of\r\nthe train fell a prey to the fiery demon. A similar accident at\r\nBradford, caused by a tank at the Anchor Oil-Company’s wells overflowing\r\nupon the tracks of the Bradford & Bordell narrow-gauge, burned two or\r\nthree persons fatally. The oil caught fire as the locomotive passed the\r\nspot and enveloped the passenger-coach in flames so quickly that escape\r\nwas cut off.\r\n\r\nBradford, Tarport, Limestone, Sawyer, Gillmor, Derrick, Red Rock, State\r\nLine, Four-Mile, Duke Centre, Rexford, Bordell, Rew City, Coleville,\r\nCuster and De Golia, with their thousands of wells, their hosts of live\r\npeople, their boundless activity, their crowded railways, their endless\r\nprocession of teams and their unlimited energy, were for the nonce the\r\nbrightest galaxy of oil-towns that ever flourished in the busy realm of\r\npetroleum. Some have vanished, others are mere skeletons and Bradford\r\nalone retains a fair semblance of its pristine greatness.\r\n\r\nThe bee-line for the north was fairly and squarely “on the belt.”\r\n\r\n                           THE SEX MEN ADORE.\r\n\r\nA little girl at Titusville, when she prayed to have herself and all of\r\nher relations cared for during the night, added: “And, dear God, do try\r\nand take good care of yourself, for if anything should happen to you we\r\nshould all go to pieces. Amen.”\r\n\r\nA young lady at Sawyer City accepted a challenge to climb a derrick on\r\nthe Hallenback farm, stand on top and wave her handkerchief. She was to\r\nreceive a silk-dress and a ten-dollar greenback. The feat was performed\r\nin good shape. It is probably the only instance on record where a woman\r\nhad the courage to climb an eighty-foot derrick, stand on top and wave\r\nher handkerchief to those below. It was done and the enterprising girl\r\ngathered in the wager.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sands, formerly a resident of Oil City, built the Sands Block and\r\nowned wells on Sage Run. McGrew Brothers, of Pittsburg, struck a spouter\r\nin 1869 that boomed Sage Run a few months. A lady at Pleasantville, who\r\nhad coined money by shrewd speculations in oil-territory, purchased\r\ntwo-hundred acres near the McGrew strike, while the well was drilling\r\nand nobody thought it worth noticing. The lady was Mrs. Sands, who\r\nenacted the role of “a poor lone widow,” anxious to secure a patch of\r\nground to raise cabbage and garden-truck, to get the property. She\r\nworked so skillfully upon the sensibilities of the Philadelphians owning\r\nthe land that they sold it for a trifle “to help a needy woman!” Her\r\nfirst well, finished the night before the “thirty-day shut down,” flowed\r\nfive-hundred barrels each twenty-four hours. The “poor lone widow”\r\nvalued the tract at a half-million dollars and at one time was rated at\r\nsix-hundred-thousand, all “earned by her own self.” Yet weak-minded men\r\nand strong-minded women talk of the suppressed sex!\r\n\r\nA Franklin lady asked her husband one morning to buy five-thousand\r\nbarrels of oil on her account, saying she had an impression the price\r\nwould advance very soon. To please her he promised to comply. At dinner\r\nshe inquired about it and was told the order had been filled by an\r\nOil-City broker. In the afternoon the price advanced rapidly. Next\r\nmorning the lady asked hubby to have the lot sold and bring her the\r\nprofits. The miserable husband was in for it. He dared not confess his\r\ndeception and the only alternative was to pay the difference and keep\r\nmum. His sickly smile, as he drew fifteen-hundred dollars out of the\r\nbank to hand his spouse, would have cracked a mirror an inch thick.\r\nSolomon got a good deal of experience from his wives and that Franklin\r\nhusband began to think “a woman might know something about business\r\nafter all.”\r\n\r\nMrs. David Hanna, of Oil City, is not one of the women whose idea of a\r\ngood time is to go to a funeral and cry. She tried a bit of speculation\r\nin certificates and the market went against her. She tried again and\r\nagain, but the losses exceeded the profits by a large majority. The\r\nphenomenal spurt in April of 1895 was her opportunity. She held down a\r\nseat in the Oil-Exchange gallery three days, sold at almost the top\r\nnotch and cleared twelve-thousand dollars. People applauded and declared\r\nthe plucky little woman “had a great head.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                    SCHRUBRASS FERRY 1873\r\n                            SUMMIT CITY\r\n            ACROSS THE BELT AT BARRINGER\r\n                                     TURKEY CITY IN 1874\r\n            FIRST HOUSE AT TRIANGLE CITY\r\n                MAIN STREET, ST.

Down the Allegheny adventurous operators groped their\r\nway patiently, until Clarion, Armstrong, Butler, Washington and West\r\nVirginia unlocked their splendid store-houses at the bidding of the\r\ndrill. Aladdin’s wondrous lamp, Stalacta’s wand or Ali Babi’s magic\r\nsesame was not so grand a talisman as the tools which from the bowels of\r\nthe earth brought forth illimitable spoil. No need of fables to varnish\r\nthe tales of struggles and triumphs, of disappointments and successes,\r\nof weary toil and rich reward that have marked the oil-development from\r\nthe Drake well to the latest strike in Tyler county. Men who go miles in\r\nadvance of developments to seek new oil-fields run big chances of\r\nfailure. They understand the risk and appreciate the cold fact that\r\nheavy loss may be entailed. But “the game is worth the powder” in their\r\nestimation and impossibility is not the sort of ability they swear by.\r\n“Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win” is\r\na maxim oil-operators have weighed carefully. The man who has faith to\r\nattempt something is a man of power, whether he hails from Hong Kong or\r\nBoston, Johannesburg or Oil City. The man who will not improve his\r\nopportunity, whether seeking salvation or petroleum, is a sure loser.\r\nHis stamina is as fragile as a fifty-cent shirt and will wear out\r\nquicker than religion that is used for a cloak only. Muttering long\r\nprayers without working to answer them is not the way to angle for\r\nsouls, or fish, or oil-wells. It demands nerve and vim and enterprise to\r\nstick thousands of dollars in a hole ten, twenty, fifty or “a hundred\r\nmiles from anywhere,” in hope of opening a fresh vein of petroleum.\r\nLuckily men possessing these qualities have not been lacking since the\r\nfirst well on Oil Creek sent forth the feeble squirt that has grown to a\r\nmighty river. Hence prolific territory, far from being scarce, has\r\nsometimes been too plentiful for the financial health of the average\r\nproducer, who found it hard to cipher out a profit selling dollar-crude\r\nat forty cents. As old fields exhausted new ones were explored in every\r\ndirection, those south of the original strike presenting a very\r\nrespectable figure in the oil-panorama. If “eternal vigilance is the\r\nprice of liberty,” eternal hustling is the price of oil-operations.\r\nMaria Seidenkovitch, a fervid Russian anarchist, who would rather hit\r\nthe Czar with a bomb than hit a thousand-barrel well, has written:\r\n\r\n             “There is no standing still! Even as I pause\r\n               The steep path shifts and I slip back apace;\r\n             Movement was safety; by the journey’s laws\r\n               No help is given, no safe abiding-place;\r\n             No idling in the pathway, hard and slow—\r\n               I must go forward or must backward go!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEN. JESSE L. RENO.]\r\n\r\nDown the Allegheny three miles, on a gentle slope facing bold hills\r\nacross the river, is the remnant of Reno, once a busy, attractive town.\r\nIt was named from Gen. Jesse L. Reno, who rose to higher rank than any\r\nother of the heroes Venango “contributed to the death-roll of\r\npatriotism.” He spent his boyhood at Franklin, was graduated from West\r\nPoint in the class with George B. McClellan and “Stonewall” Jackson,\r\nserved in the Mexican war, was promoted to Major-General and fell at the\r\nbattle of South Mountain in 1862. The Reno Oil-Company, organized in\r\n1865 as the Reno-Oil-and-Land Company, owns the village-site and\r\ntwelve-hundred acres of adjacent farms. The company and the town owed\r\ntheir creation to the master-mind of Hon. C. V. Culver, to whose rare\r\nfaculty for developing grand enterprises the oil-regions offered an\r\ninviting field. Visiting Venango county early in the sixties, a canvass\r\nof the district convinced him that the oil-industry, then an infant\r\nbeginning to creep, must attain giant proportions. To meet the need of\r\nincreased facilities for business, he conceived the idea of a system of\r\nbanks at convenient points and opened the first at Franklin in 1861.\r\nOthers were established at Oil City, Titusville and suitable\r\ntrade-centres until the combination embraced twenty banks and\r\nbanking-houses, headed by the great office of Culver, Penn & Co. in New\r\nYork. All enjoyed large patronage and were converted into corporate\r\nbanks. The speculative mania, unequaled in the history of the world,\r\nthat swept over the oil-regions in 1864-5, deluged the banks with\r\napplications for temporary loans to be used in purchasing lands and\r\noil-interests. Philadelphia alone had nine-hundred stock-companies. New\r\nYork was a close second and over seven-hundred-million dollars were\r\ncapitalized—on paper—for petroleum-speculations! The production of oil\r\nwas a new and unprecedented business, subject to no known laws and\r\nconstantly overturning theories that set limits to its expansion. There\r\nwas no telling where flowing-wells, spouting thousands of dollars daily\r\nwithout expense to the owners, might be encountered. Stories of sudden\r\nfortunes, by the discovery of oil on lands otherwise valueless, pressed\r\nthe button and the glut of paper-currency did the rest.\r\n\r\nMr. Culver directed the management and employment of fifteen-million\r\ndollars in the spring of 1865! People literally begged him to handle\r\ntheir money, elected him to Congress and insisted that he invest their\r\ncash and bonds. The Reno Oil-Company included men of the highest\r\npersonal and commercial standing. Preliminary tests satisfied the\r\nofficers of the company that the block of land at Reno was valuable\r\nterritory. They decided to operate it, to improve the town and build a\r\nrailroad to Pithole, in order to command the trade of Oil Creek, Cherry\r\nRun and “the Magic City.” Oil City opposed the railroad strenuously,\r\nrefusing a right-of-way and compelling the choice of a circuitous route,\r\nwith difficult grades to climb and ugly ravines to span. At length a\r\nconsolidation of competing interests was arranged, to be formally\r\nratified on March twenty-ninth, 1866. Meanwhile rumors affecting the\r\ncredit of the Culver banks were circulated. Disastrous floods, the close\r\nof the war and the amazing collapse of Pithole had checked speculation\r\nand impaired confidence in oil-values. Responsible parties wished to\r\nstock the Reno Company at five-million dollars and Mr. Culver was in\r\nWashington completing the railroad-negotiations which, in one week,\r\nwould give him control of nearly a million. A run on his banks was\r\nstarted, the strain could not be borne and on March twenty-seventh,\r\n1866, the failure of Culver, Penn & Co. was announced. The assets at\r\ncost largely exceeded the liabilities of four-million dollars, but the\r\nnatural result of the suspension was to discredit everything with which\r\nthe firm had been identified. The railroad-consolidation, confessedly\r\nadvantageous to all concerned, was not confirmed and Reno stock was\r\nwithheld from the market. While the creditors generally co-operated to\r\nprotect the assets and adjust matters fairly, a few defeated measures\r\nlooking to a safe deliverance. These short-sighted individuals\r\nsacrificed properties, instituted harassing prosecutions and\r\nprecipitated a crisis that involved tremendous losses. Many a man\r\nstanding on his brother’s neck claims to be looking up far into the sky\r\nwatching for the Lord to come!\r\n\r\nThe fabric reared with infinite pains toppled, pulling down others in\r\nits fall. The Reno, Oil-Creek & Pithole Railroad, within a mile of\r\ncompletion, crumbled into ruin. The architect of the splendid plans that\r\nten days of grace would have carried to fruition displayed his manly\r\nfiber in the dark days of adversity and he has been amply vindicated.\r\nInstead of yielding to despair and “letting things take their course,”\r\nhe strove to realize for the creditors every dollar that could be saved\r\nfrom the wreck. Animated by a lofty motive, for thirty years Mr. Culver\r\nhas labored tirelessly to discharge the debts of the partnership. No\r\nspirit could be braver, no life more unselfish, no line of action more\r\nsteadfastly devoted to a worthy object. He had bought property and\r\nsought to enhance its value, but he had never gambled in stocks, never\r\ndealt in shares on the mere hazard of a rise or gone outside the\r\nbusiness—except to help customers whose necessities appealed to his\r\nsympathy—with which he was intimately connected. Driven to the wall by\r\nstress of circumstances and general distrust, he has actually paid off\r\nall the small claims and multitudes of large ones against his banks. How\r\nmany men, with no legal obligation to enforce their payment, would toil\r\nfor a generation to meet such demands? Thistles do not bear figs and\r\nbanana-vendors are not the only persons who should be judged by their\r\nfruits. It is a good thing to achieve success and better still to\r\ndeserve it. Gauged by the standard of high resolve, earnest purpose and\r\npersistent endeavor—by what he has tried to do and not by what may have\r\nbeen said of him—Charles Vernon Culver can afford to accept the verdict\r\nof his peers and of the Omniscient Judge, who “discerns the thoughts and\r\nintents of the heart.”\r\n\r\n           “I will go on then, though the limbs may tire,\r\n             And though the path be doubtful and unseen;\r\n           Better with the last effort to expire\r\n             Than lose the toil and struggle that have been,\r\n           And have the morning strength, the upward strain,\r\n           The distance conquered in the end made vain.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES H. OSMER.]\r\n\r\nReorganized in the interest of Culver, Penn & Co.’s creditors, the Reno\r\nCompany developed its property methodically. No. 18 well, finished in\r\nMay of 1870, pumped two-hundred barrels and caused a flutter of\r\nexcitement. Fifty others, drilled in 1870-1, were so satisfactory that\r\nthe stockholders might have shouted “Keno!” The company declined to\r\nlease and very few dry-holes were put down on the tract. Gas supplied\r\nfuel and the sand, coarse and pebbly, produced oil of superior gravity\r\nat five to six-hundred feet. Reno grew, a spacious hotel was built,\r\nstores prospered, two railroads had stations and derricks dotted the\r\nbanks of the Allegheny. The company’s business was conducted admirably,\r\nit reaped liberal profits and operated in Forest county. Its affairs are\r\nin excellent shape and it has a neat production today. Mr. Culver and\r\nHon. Galusha A. Grow have been its presidents and Hon. J. H. Osmer is\r\nnow the chief officer. Mr. Osmer is a leader of the Venango bar and has\r\nlived at Franklin thirty-two years. His thorough knowledge of law,\r\nsturdy independence, scorn of pettifogging and skill as a pleader gained\r\nhim an immense practice. He has been retained in nearly all the most\r\nimportant cases before the court for twenty-five years and appears\r\nfrequently in the State and the United-States Supreme Courts. He is a\r\nlogical reasoner and brilliant orator, convincing juries and audiences\r\nby his incisive arguments. He served in Congress with distinguished\r\ncredit. His two sons have adopted the legal profession and are\r\nassociated with their father. A man of positive individuality and\r\nsterling character, a friend in cloud and sunshine, a deep thinker and\r\nentertaining talker is James H. Osmer.\r\n\r\nCranberry township, a regular petroleum-huckleberry, duplicated the Reno\r\npool at Milton, with a vigorous offshoot at Bredinsburg and nibbles\r\nlying around loose. Below Franklin the second-sand sandwich and\r\nBully-Hill successes were special features. A mile up East Sandy\r\nCreek—it separates Cranberry and Rockland—was Gas City, on a toploftical\r\nhill twelve miles south of Oil City. A well sunk in 1864 had heaps of\r\ngas, which caught fire and burned seven years. E. E. Wightman and\r\nPatrick Canning drilled five good wells in 1871 and Gas City came into\r\nbeing. Vendergrift & Forman constructed a pipeline and telegraph to Oil\r\nCity. Gas fired the boilers, lighted the streets, heated the dwellings\r\nand great quantities wasted. The pressure could be run up to\r\nthree-hundred pounds and utilized to run engines in place of steam, were\r\nit not for the fine grit with the gas, which wore out the cylinders.\r\nWells that supplied fuel to pump themselves seemed very similar to mills\r\nthat furnished their own motive-power and grist for the hoppers. A cow\r\nthat gave milk and provided food for herself by the process could not be\r\nslicker. Gas City vaporized a year or two and flickered out. The last\r\njet has been extinguished and not a glimmer of gas or symptom of wells\r\nhas been visible for many years.\r\n\r\nFifteen of the first sixteen wells at Foster gladdened the owners by\r\nyielding bountifully. To drill, to tube, to pump, to get done-up with a\r\ndry-hole, “aye, there’s the rub” that tests a fellow’s mettle and\r\nchanges blithe hope to bleak despair. Foster wells were not of that\r\ncomplexion. They lined the steep cliff that resembles an Alpine farm\r\ntilted on end to drain off, the derricks standing like sentries on the\r\nwatch that nobody walked away with the romantic landscape. Lovers of the\r\nsterner moods of nature would revel in the rugged scenery, which\r\ndiscounts the overpraised Hudson and must have fostered sublime emotions\r\nin the impassive redmen. Indian-God Rock, inscribed with untranslatable\r\nhieroglyphics, presumably tells what “Lo” thought of the surroundings.\r\nSix miles south of the huge rock, which somebody proposed to boat to\r\nFranklin and set in the park as an interesting memento of the\r\naborigines, was “the burning well.” For years the gas blazed,\r\nilluminating the hills and keeping a plot of grass constantly fresh and\r\ngreen. The flood in 1865 overflowed the hole, but the gas burned just as\r\nthough water were its native element. It was the fad for sleighing\r\nparties to visit the well, dance on the sward when snow lay a yard deep\r\nten rods away and hold outdoor picnics in January and February. This\r\npractically realized the fancy of the boy who wished winter would come\r\nin summer, that he might coast on the Fourth of July in shirt-sleeves\r\nand linen-pants. Here and there in the interior of Rockland township\r\nmorsels of oil have been unearthed and small wells are pumping to-day.\r\n\r\nC. D. Angell leased blocks of land from Foster to Scrubgrass in 1870-71\r\nand jabbed them with holes that confirmed his “belt theory.” His first\r\nwell—a hundred-barreler—on Belle Island, a few rods below the station,\r\nopened the Scrubgrass field. On the Rockland side of the river the\r\nMcMillan and 99 wells headed a list of remunerative producers. Back a\r\nquarter-mile the territory was tricky, wells that showed for big strikes\r\nsometimes proving of little account. A town toddled into existence.\r\nGregory—the genial host joined the heavenly host long ago—had a hotel at\r\nwhich trains stopped for meals. James Kennerdell ran a general store and\r\nthe post-office. The town was busy and had nothing scrubby except the\r\nname. The wells retired from business, the depot burned down, the people\r\nvanished and Kennerdell Station was established a half-mile north.\r\nWilson Cross continued his store at the old stand until his death in\r\nMarch, 1896. Within a year paying wells have been drilled near the\r\nstation and two miles southward. On the opposite bank Major W. T. Baum,\r\nof Franklin, has a half-dozen along the base of the hill that net him a\r\nprincely return. A couple of miles north-west, in Victory township,\r\nConway Brothers, of Philadelphia, recently drilled a well forty-two\r\nhundred feet. The last sixty feet were sand with a flavor of oil, the\r\ndeepest sand and petroleum recorded up to the present time. Careful\r\nrecords of the strata and temperature were taken. Once a thermometer\r\nslipped from Mr. Conway’s hand and tumbled to the bottom of the well,\r\nthe greatest drop of the mercury in any age or clime.\r\n\r\nSixty farmers combined in the fall of 1859 to drill the first well in\r\nScrubgrass township, on the Rhodabarger tract. They rushed it like sixty\r\nsix-hundred feet, declined to pay more assessments, kicked over the\r\ndashboard and spilled the whole combination. The first productive well\r\nwas Aaron Kepler’s, drilled on the Russell farm in 1863, and John\r\nCrawford’s farm had the largest of the early ventures. On the Witherup\r\nfarm, at the mouth of Scrubgrass Creek, paying wells were drilled in\r\n1867. Considerable skirmishing was done at intervals without startling\r\nresults. The first drilling in Clinton township was on. the Kennerdell\r\nproperty, two miles west of the Allegheny, the Big-Bend Oil-Company\r\nsinking a dry-hole in 1864-5. Jonathan Watson bored two in 1871, finding\r\ntraces of oil in a thin layer of sand. The Kennerdell block of\r\nnine-hundred acres figured as the scene of milling operations from the\r\nbeginning of the century. David Phipps—the Phipps families are still\r\namong the most prominent in Venango county—built a grist-mill on the\r\nproperty in 1812, a saw-mill and a woolen-factory, operated an\r\niron-furnace a mile up the creek and founded a natty village. Fire\r\ndestroyed his factory and Richard Kennerdel bought the place in 1853. He\r\nbuilt a woolen-mill that attained national celebrity, farmed\r\nextensively, conducted a large store and for thirty years was a leading\r\nbusiness-man. A handsome fortune, derived from manufacturing and\r\noil-wells on his lands, and the respect of all classes rewarded the\r\nenterprise, sagacity and hospitality of this progressive citizen. The\r\nfactory he reared has been dismantled, the pretty little settlement amid\r\nthe romantic hills of Clinton is deserted and the man to whom both owed\r\ntheir development rests from his labors. Mr. Kennerdell possessed\r\nboundless energy, decision and the masterly qualities that surmount\r\nobstacles, build up a community and round out a manly character. Cornen\r\nBrothers have a production on the Kennerdell tract, which they purchased\r\nin 1892. During the Bullion furore a bridge was built at Scrubgrass and\r\na railroad to Kennerdell was constructed. Ice carried off the bridge and\r\nthe faithful old ferry holds the fort as in the days of John A. Canan\r\nand George McCullough.\r\n\r\nPhillips Brothers, who had operated largely on Oil Creek and in Butler\r\ncounty, leased thousands of acres in Clinton and drilled a number of\r\ndry-holes. Believing a rich pool existed in that latitude, they were not\r\ndeterred by reverses that would have stampeded operators of less\r\nexperience. On August ninth, 1876, John Taylor and Robert Cundle\r\nfinished a two-hundred-barrel spouter on the George W. Gealy farm, two\r\nmiles north of Kennerdell. They sold to Phillips Brothers, who were\r\ndrilling on adjacent farms. The new strike opened the Bullion field,\r\ntoward which the current turned forthwith. H. L. Taylor and John\r\nSatterfield, the biggest operators in Butler, visited the Gealy well and\r\noffered a half-million dollars for the Phillips interests in Clinton. A\r\nhundred oilmen stood watching the flow that August morning. The parties\r\nconsulted briefly and Isaac Phillips invited me to walk with him a few\r\nrods. He said: “Taylor & Satterfield wish to take our property at\r\nfive-hundred-thousand dollars. This is a good deal of money, but we have\r\ndeclined it. We think there will be a million in this field for us if we\r\ndevelop it ourselves.” They carried out this programme and the estimate\r\nwas approximated closely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. J. MYERS.]\r\n\r\nThe Sutton, Simcox, Taylor, Henderson, Davis, Gealy, Newton and\r\nBerringer farms were operated rapidly. Tack Brothers paid ten-thousand\r\ndollars to Taylor for thirty acres and Porter Phipps leased fifteen\r\nacres, which he sold to Emerson & Brownson, whose first well started at\r\nseven-hundred barrels. Phillips Brothers’ No. 3 well, on the Gealy farm,\r\nwas a four-hundred-barreler. In January, 1877, Frank Nesbit’s No. 2,\r\nHenderson farm, flowed five-hundred barrels, and in February the\r\nGalloway began at two-hundred. The McCalmont Oil-Company’s Big Medicine,\r\non the Newton Farm, tipped the beam at one-thousand barrels on June\r\nseventh. Mitchell & Lee’s Big Injun flowed three-thousand barrels on\r\nJune eighteenth, the biggest yield in the district. Ten yards away a\r\ngalaxy of Franklinites drilled the driest kind of a dry-hole. In August\r\nthe McCalmont No. 31 and the Phillips No. 7 gauged a plump thousand\r\napiece. These were the largest wells and they exhausted speedily. The\r\noil from the Gealy No. 1 was hauled to Scrubgrass until connections\r\ncould be laid to the United Pipe-Lines. The Bullion field, in which a\r\nfew skeleton-wells produce a few barrels daily, extended seven miles in\r\nlength and three-eighths of a mile in width. Like the business-end of a\r\nhealthy wasp, “it was little, but—oh, my!” It swerved the tide from\r\nBradford and ruled the petroleum-roost eighteen months. Summit City on\r\nthe Simcox farm, Berringer City on the Berringer farm, and Dean City on\r\nthe McCalmont farm flourished during the excitement. The first house at\r\nSummit was built on December eighth, 1876. In June of 1877 the town\r\nboasted two-hundred buildings and fifteen-hundred population. Abram\r\nMyers, the last resident, left in April of 1889. All three towns have\r\n“faded into nothingness” and of the five-hundred wells producing at the\r\nsummit of Bullion’s short-lived prosperity not a dozen survive. Westward\r\na new strip was opened, the wells on several farms yielding their owners\r\na pleasant income. J. J. Myers, whose home is now at Hartstown, operated\r\nsuccessfully in this district. George Rumsey, an enterprising citizen,\r\nis the lucky owner of a number of slick wells. The pretty town of\r\nClintonville has been largely benefited by oil-operations in the\r\nvicinity. It is surrounded by a fine agricultural country and possesses\r\nmany desirable features as a place of residence. Bullion had its turn\r\nand others were to follow in short meter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEO. RUMSEY.]\r\n\r\n               “’Tis not too late to seek a newer world,\r\n               Tho’ much is taken, much abides.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW ON RITCHEY RUN.]\r\n\r\nMajor St. George—the kindly old man sleeps in the Franklin cemetery—had\r\na bunch of wells and lived in a small house close to the\r\nAllegheny-Valley track, near the siding in Rockland township that bears\r\nhis name. At Rockland Station a stone chimney, a landmark for many\r\nyears, marked the early abode of Hon. Elisha W. Davis, who operated at\r\nFranklin, was speaker of the House of Representatives and the\r\nState-Senate five terms and spent the closing years of his active life\r\nin Philadelphia. Emlenton, the lively town at the south-eastern corner\r\nof Venango county, was a thriving place prior to the oil-development.\r\nThe wells in the vicinity were generally medium, Ritchey Run having some\r\nof the best. This romantic stream, south of the town, borders Clarion\r\ncounty for a mile or two from its mouth. John Kerr, a squatter, cleared\r\na portion of the forest and was drowned in the river, slipping off a\r\nflat rock two miles below his bit of land. The site of Emlenton was\r\nsurveyed and the warrant from the state given in 1796 to Samuel B. Fox,\r\ngreat-grandfather of the late William Logan Fox and J. M. Fox, of\r\nFoxburg. Joseph M., son of Samuel B. Fox, settled on the land in 1827.\r\nAndrew McCaslin owned the tract above, from about where the Valley Hotel\r\nand the public-school now stand. He was elected sheriff in 1832 and\r\nbuilt an iron-furnace. As a compliment to Mrs. Fox—Miss Hanna Emlen—he\r\nnamed the hamlet Emlenton. Doctor James Growe built the third house in\r\nthe settlement. The covered wooden-bridge, usually supposed to have been\r\nbrought over in the Mayflower, withstood floods and ice-gorges until\r\nApril of 1883. John Keating, who had the second store, built a furnace\r\nnear St. Petersburg and held a thousand acres of land. Oil-producers\r\nwere well represented in the growing town, which has been the home of\r\nMarcus Hulings, L. E. Mallory, D. D. Moriarty, M. C. Treat and R. W.\r\nPorterfield. James Bennett, a leader in business, built the brick\r\nopera-house and the flour-mills and headed the company that built the\r\nEmlenton & Shippenville Railroad, which ran to Edenburg at the height of\r\nthe Clarion development. Emlenton is supplied with natural-gas and noted\r\nfor good schools, good hotels and get-up-and-get citizens and is\r\nwide-awake in every respect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. A. W. CRAWFORD.]\r\n\r\nDr. A. W. Crawford, of Emlenton, who served in the Legislature, was\r\nappointed consul to Antwerp by President Lincoln in 1861. At the time he\r\nreached Antwerp a cheap illuminant was unknown on the continent. Gas was\r\nused in the cities, but the people of Antwerp depended mainly upon\r\nrape-seed oil. Only wealthy people could afford it and the poorer folks\r\nwent to bed in the dark. From Antwerp to Brussels the country was\r\nshrouded in gloom at night. Not a light could be seen outside the towns,\r\nin the most populous section on earth. A few gallons of American refined\r\nhad appeared in Antwerp previous to Dr. Crawford’s arrival. It was\r\nregarded as an object of curiosity. A leading firm inquired about this\r\nnew American product and Dr. Crawford was the man who could give the\r\ninformation. He was from the very part of the country where the new\r\nilluminant was produced. The upshot of the matter was that Dr. Crawford\r\nput the firm in communication with American shippers, which led to an\r\norder of forty barrels by Aug. Schmitz & Son, Antwerp dealers. The\r\narticle had tremendous prejudice to overcome, but the exporters\r\nsucceeded in finally disposing of their stock. It yielded them a net\r\nreturn of forty francs. The oil won its way and from the humble\r\nbeginning of forty barrels in 1861, the following year witnessing a\r\ndemand for fifteen-hundred-thousand gallons. By 1863 it had come largely\r\ninto use and since that time it has become a staple article of commerce.\r\nDr. Crawford served as consul at Antwerp until 1866, when he returned\r\nhome and began a successful career as an oil-producer. It was fortunate\r\nthat Col. Drake chanced upon the shallowest spot in the oil-regions\r\nwhere petroleum has ever been found, when he located the first well, and\r\nequally lucky that a practical oilman represented the United States at\r\nAntwerp in 1861. Had Drake chanced upon a dry-hole and some other man\r\nbeen consul at Antwerp, oil-developments might have been retarded for\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n                     “Oft what seems a trifle,\r\n         A mere nothing in itself, in some nice situations\r\n         Turns the scale of Fate and rules important actions.”\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in the original land-warrants to Samuel\r\nM. Fox certain mineral-rights are reserved, although oil is not\r\nspecified. A clause in each of the documents reads:\r\n\r\n* * * “To the use of him, the said Samuel M. Fox, his heirs and assigns\r\nforever, free and clear of all restriction and reservation as to mines,\r\nroyalties, quit-rents or otherwise, excepting and reserving only the\r\nfifth part of all gold and silver-ore for the use of this Commonwealth,\r\nto be delivered at the pit’s mouth free of all charges.”\r\n\r\nThe lands of Joseph M. Fox extended five miles down the Allegheny, to\r\nthe north bank of the Clarion River. He built a home a mile back of the\r\nAllegheny and endeavored to have the county-seat established at the\r\njunction of the two streams. The village of Foxburg, which bears the\r\nfamily-name and is four miles below Emlenton, had no existence until\r\nlong after his death. Contrary to the accepted opinion, he was not a\r\nQuaker, nor do his descendants belong to the Society of Friends or any\r\nreligious denomination in particular.\r\n\r\nThe prudence and wisdom of his father’s policy left the estate in\r\nexcellent shape when its management devolved largely upon W. L. Fox.\r\nProgressive and far-seeing, the young man possessed in eminent degree\r\nthe business-qualities needed to handle vast interests successfully. His\r\nhonored mother and his younger brother aided him in building up and\r\nconstantly improving the rich heritage. Oil-operations upon and around\r\nit added enormously to the value of the property. Hundreds of prolific\r\nwells yielded bounteously and the town of Foxburg blossomed into the\r\nprettiest spot on the banks of the Allegheny. The Foxes erected a\r\nspacious school and hotel, graded the streets, put up dainty residences\r\nand fostered the growing community most generously. A bank was\r\nestablished, stores and dwellings multiplied, the best people found the\r\nsurroundings congenial and the lawless element had no place in the\r\nattractive settlement. The master-hand of William Logan Fox was visible\r\neverywhere. With him to plan was to execute. He constructed the railroad\r\nthat connected Foxburg with St. Petersburg, Edenburg and Clarion. The\r\nslow hacks gave way to the swift iron-horse that brought the interior\r\ntowns into close communication with each other and the world outside. It\r\nwould be impossible to estimate the advantage of this enterprise to the\r\nproducers and the citizens of the adjacent country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAILROAD BRIDGE NEAR CLARION.]\r\n\r\nThe narrow-gauge railroad from Foxburg to Clarion was an engineering\r\nnovelty. It zig-zagged to overcome the big hill at the start, twisted\r\naround ravines and crossed gorges on dizzy trestles. Near Clarion was\r\nthe highest and longest bridge, a wooden structure on stilts, curved and\r\nsingle-tracked. One dark night a drummer employed by a Pittsburg house\r\nwas drawn over it safely in a buggy. The horse left the wagon-road, got\r\non the railroad-track, walked across the bridge—the ties supporting the\r\nrails were a foot apart—and fetched up at his stable about midnight. The\r\ndrummer, who had imbibed too freely and was fast asleep in the vehicle,\r\nknew nothing of the drive, which the marks of the wheels on the\r\napproaches and the ties revealed next morning. The horse kept closely to\r\nthe center of the track, while the wheels on the right were outside the\r\nrails. Had the faithful animal veered a foot to the right, the buggy\r\nwould have tumbled over the trestle and there would have been a vacant\r\nchair in commercial ranks and a new voice in the celestial choir. That\r\nthe horse did not step between the ties and stick fast was a wonder. The\r\ntrip was as perilous as the Mohammedan passage to Paradise over a\r\nslack-wire or Blondin’s tight-rope trip across Niagara.\r\n\r\nMr. Fox’s busy brain conceived even greater things for the benefit of\r\nthe neighborhood. Millions of capital enabled him to carry out the ideas\r\nof his resourceful mind. He created opportunities to invest his wealth\r\nin ways that meant the greatest good to the greatest number. The family\r\nheartily seconded his efforts to advance the general welfare. He built\r\nand operated the only extensive individual pipe-line in the oil-regions.\r\nTo extend the trade and influence of Foxburg he devised new lines of\r\nrailway, which would traverse a section abounding in coal, timber and\r\nagricultural products. He outlined the plan of an immense refinery,\r\ndesigned to employ a host of skilled workmen and utilize the crude-oil\r\nderived from the wells within several miles of his home. In the midst of\r\nthese and other useful projects, in the very heyday of vigorous manhood,\r\njust as the full fruition of his highest hopes seemed about to be\r\ngrandly realized, the end of his bright career came suddenly. His death,\r\nmet in the discharge of duty, was almost tragic in its manner and\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM LOGAN FOX.]\r\n\r\nIn February of 1880 Conductor W. W. Gaither, of the Foxburg-Clarion\r\nRailroad, ejected a peddler named John Clancy from his train, near\r\nKing’s Mills, for refusing to pay his fare. Clancy shot Gaither, who\r\ndied in a few days from the wound. W. L. Fox was the president of the\r\nroad and a warm personal friend of the murdered conductor. He took\r\ncharge of the pistol and became active in bringing Clancy to punishment.\r\nClancy was placed on trial at Clarion. President Fox was to produce the\r\npistol in court. Leaving home on the early train for Clarion, he had\r\nproceeded some distance from Foxburg when he discovered he had forgotten\r\nthe pistol. He stopped the train and ran back to get the weapon. When he\r\nreturned he was almost exhausted. W. J. McConnell, beside whom he was\r\nsitting, attempted to revive him, but he sank into unconsciousness and\r\nexpired in the car near the spot where his friend Gaither was shot.\r\nClancy was convicted of murder in the second degree and sentenced to\r\neight years in the penitentiary. His wife and twelve-year-old son were\r\nleft destitute. The boy went to work for a farmer near St. Petersburg. A\r\nweek later, it is said, he was crossing a field in which a vicious bull\r\nwas feeding. The bull attacked him, ripped his side open, tossed him\r\nfrom the field into the road and the boy died in a short time. Besides\r\nthese fatalities resulting from Clancy’s crime, the business of Foxburg\r\nwas seriously crippled. The village depended mainly upon the\r\noil-business of the Fox estate, of which Mr. Fox, although only\r\ntwenty-nine years old, was manager. Its three-thousand acres of\r\noil-territory, but partially developed, yielded forty-five-thousand\r\nbarrels of crude a month. The refinery was never built, the pipe-line\r\nwas sold and extensive development of the property practically ceased.\r\nThe pathetic death of William Logan Fox took the distribution of a\r\nmillion dollars a year from the region about Foxburg. The stricken\r\nfamily erected a splendid church to his memory, but it is seldom used.\r\nMuch of its trade and population has sought other fields and the pretty\r\ntown is merely a shadow of the past.\r\n\r\n                 “The massive gates of circumstance\r\n                   Are turned upon the smallest hinge,\r\n                 And thus some seeming pettiest chance\r\n                   Oft gives our life its after tinge.”\r\n\r\nFertig & Hammond drilled numerous wells on the Fox estate in 1870-71 and\r\nstarted a bank. Operations were pressed actively by producers from the\r\nupper districts. Foxburg was the jumping off point for pilgrims to the\r\nClarion field, which Galey No. 1 well, on Grass Flats, inaugurated in\r\nAugust, 1871. Others on the Flats, ranging from thirty to eighty\r\nbarrels, boomed Foxburg and speedily advanced St. Petersburg, three\r\nmiles inland, from a sleepy village of thirty houses to a busy town of\r\nthree-thousand population. In September of 1871 Marcus Hulings, whose\r\ngreat specialty was opening new fields, finished a hundred-barrel well\r\non the Ashbaugh farm, a mile beyond St. Petersburg. The town of Antwerp\r\nwas one result. The first building, erected in the spring of 1872, in\r\nsixty days had the company of four groceries, three hotels, innumerable\r\nsaloons, telegraph-office, school-house and two-hundred dwellings. Its\r\ngeneral style was summed up by the victim of a poker-game in the\r\nexpressive words: “If you want a smell of brimstone before supper go to\r\nAntwerp!” Fire in 1873 wiped it off the face of the planet.\r\n\r\nCharles H. Cramer, now proprietor of a hotel in Pittsburg, left the\r\nButler field to drill the Antwerp well, in which he had a\r\nquarter-interest. James M. Lambing, for whom he had been drilling,\r\njokingly remarked: “When you return ‘broke’ from the wildcat well on the\r\nAshbaugh farm I will have another job for you.” It illustrates the ups\r\nand downs of the oil business in the seventies to note that, when the\r\nwell was completed, Lambing had met with financial reverses and Cramer\r\nwas in a position to give out jobs on his own hook. Victor Gretter was\r\none of the spectators of the oil flowing over the derrick. The waste\r\nsuggested to him the idea of the oil-saver, which he patented. This\r\nstrike reduced the price of crude a dollar a barrel. Antwerp would have\r\nbeen more important but for its nearness to St. Petersburg, which\r\ndisastrous fires in 1872-3 could not prevent from ranking with the best\r\ntowns of Oildom. Stages from Foxburg were crowded until the narrow-gauge\r\nrailroad furnished improved facilities for travel. Schools, churches,\r\nhotels, newspapers, two banks and an opera-house flourished. The\r\nPickwick Club was a famous social organization. The Collner, Shoup,\r\nVensel, Palmer and Ashbaugh farms and Grass Flats produced\r\nthree-thousand barrels a day. Oil was five to six dollars and business\r\nstrode ahead like the wearer of the Seven-League Boots. Now the\r\nerstwhile busy town is back to its pristine quietude and the farms that\r\nproduced oil have resumed the production of corn and grass.\r\n\r\nA jolly Dutchman near St. Petersburg, who married his second wife soon\r\nafter the funeral of the first, was visited with a two-hours’ serenade\r\nin token of disapproval. He expostulated pathetically thus: “I say,\r\npoys, you ought to be ashamed of myself to be making all dish noise ven\r\nder vas a funeral here purty soon not long ago.” This dispersed the\r\nparty more effectually than a bull-dog and a revolver could have done.\r\n\r\nA girl just returned to St. Petersburg from a Boston high-school said,\r\nupon seeing the new fire-engine at work: “Who would evah have dweamed\r\nsuch a vewy diminutive looking apawatus would hold so much wattah!”\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” said mirth-loving Con. O’Donnell to an elderly\r\nman in a white cravat whom he overtook on the outskirts of Antwerp and\r\nproposed to invite to ride in his buggy. “I am going to heaven, my son.\r\nI have been on my way for eighteen years.” “Well, good-bye, old fellow!\r\nIf you have been traveling toward heaven for eighteen years and got no\r\nnearer than Antwerp, I will take another route.”\r\n\r\nThe course of operations extended past Keating Furnace, up and beyond\r\nTurkey Run, a dozen miles from the mouth of the Clarion River. Good\r\nwells on the Ritts and Neeley farms originated Richmond, a small place\r\nthat fizzled out in a year. The Irwin well, a mile farther, flowed\r\nthree-hundred barrels in September of 1872. The gas took fire and burned\r\nthree men to death. The entire ravine and contiguous slopes proved\r\ndesirable territory, although the streak rarely exceeded a mile in\r\nbreadth. Turkey City, in a nice expanse to the east of the famous\r\nSlicker farm, for months was second only to St. Petersburg as a frontier\r\ntown. It had four stages to Foxburg, a post-office, daily mail-service\r\nand two passable hotels. George Washington, who took a hack at a\r\ncherry-tree, might have preferred walking to the drive over the rough,\r\ncut-up roads that led to and from Turkey City. The wells averaged\r\neleven-hundred feet, with excellent sand and loads of gas for fuel.\r\nRichard Owen and Alan Cochran, of Rouseville, opened a jack-pot on the\r\nJohnson farm, above town. Wells lasted for years and this nook of the\r\nClarion district could match pennies with any other in the business of\r\nproducing oil.\r\n\r\nNorthward two miles was Dogtown, beautifully situated in the midst of a\r\nrich agricultural section. The descendents of the first settlers retain\r\ntheir characteristics of their German ancestors. Frugal, honest and\r\nindustrious, they live comfortably in their narrow sphere and save their\r\ngains. The Delo farm, another mile north, was for a time the limit of\r\ndevelopments. True to his instincts as a discoverer of new territory,\r\nMarcus Hulings went six miles north-east of St. Petersburg, leased B.\r\nDelo’s farm and drilled a forty-barrel well in the spring of 1872.\r\nEnormous quantities of gas were found in the second sand. The oil was\r\npiped to Oil City. A half-mile east, on the Hummell farm, Salem\r\ntownship, Lee & Plumer struck a hundred-barreler in July of 1872. The\r\nHummell farm had been occupied for sixty years by a venerable Teuton,\r\nwhose rustic son of fifty-five summers described himself as “the\r\npishness man ov the firm.” The new well, twelve-hundred feet deep, had\r\ntwenty-eight feet of nice sand and considerable gas. Its success bore\r\nfruit speedily in the shape of a “town” dubbed Pickwick by Plumer, who\r\nbelonged to the redoubtable Pickwick Club at St. Petersburg. A\r\nquarter-mile ahead, on a three-cornered plot, Triangle City bloomed. The\r\nfirst building was a hotel and the second a hardware store, owned by\r\nLavens & Evans. Charles Lavens operated largely in the Clarion region\r\nand in the northern field, lived at Franklin several years and removed\r\nto Bradford. He is president of the Bradford Commercial Bank and a\r\ntip-top fellow at all times and under all circumstances. Evans may claim\r\nrecognition as the author, in the muddled days of shut-downs and\r\nsuspensions in 1872, of the world-famed platform of the Grass-Flats\r\nproducers: “Resolved that we don’t care a damn!” The three tailors of\r\nTooley street, who issued a manifesto as “We, the people of England,”\r\nwere outclassed by Evans and his friends. News of their action was\r\nflashed to every “council” and “union” in the oil-country, with more\r\nstimulating effect than a whole broadside of formal declarations.\r\nTriangle, Pickwick and Paris City have passed to the realm of\r\nforgetfulness.\r\n\r\nMarcus Hulings, a leader in the world of petroleum, was born near\r\nPhilipsburg, Clarion county, and began his career as a producer in 1860.\r\nFor some years he had been a contractor and builder and he turned his\r\npractical knowledge of mechanics to good account. His earliest\r\noil-venture was a well on the Allegheny River above Oil City, for which\r\nhe refused sixty-thousand dollars. To be nearer the producing-fields, he\r\nremoved to Emlenton and resided there a number of years. The Hulings\r\nfamily had been identified with Venango county from the first\r\nsettlement, one of them establishing a ferry at Franklin a century ago.\r\nPrior to that date the family owned and lived on what is now Duncan’s\r\nIsland, at the junction of the Susquehanna and Juniata Rivers, fifteen\r\nmiles north-west of Harrisburg. Marcus was a pathfinder in Forest county\r\nand opened the Clarion region. He leased Clark & Babcock’s six-thousand\r\nacres in McKean county and drilled hundreds of paying wells. Deciding to\r\nlocate at Oil City, he built an elegant home on the South Side and\r\nbought a delightful place in Crawford county for a summer residence. His\r\nliberality, enterprise and energy seemed inexhaustible. He donated a\r\nmagnificent hall to Allegheny College, Meadville, aided churches and\r\nschools, relieved the poor and was active in political affairs. Besides\r\nhis vast oil-interests he had mines in Arizona and California, mills on\r\nthe Pacific coast and huge lumber-tracts in West Virginia. Self-poised\r\nand self-reliant, daring yet prudent, brave and trustworthy, he was one\r\nof the grandest representatives of the petroleum-industry. Neither\r\npuffed up by prosperity nor unduly cast down by adversity, he met\r\nobstacles resolutely and accepted results manfully. My last talk with\r\nhim was at Pittsburg, where he told of his endeavor to organize a\r\ncompany to develop silver-claims in Mexico. He had grown older and\r\nweaker, but the earnestness of youth was still his possession. His eyes\r\nsparkled and his face lightened as he shook my hand at parting and said:\r\n“You will hear from me soon. If this company can be organized I would\r\nnot exchange my Mexican properties for the wealth of the Astors!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FREDERICK PLUMER\r\n  MARCUS HULINGS         JOHN LEE\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe died in a few weeks, his dream unfulfilled. Losses in the west had\r\nreduced his fortune without impairing his splendid courage, hope and\r\npatience. He united the endurance of a soldier with the skill of a\r\ncommander. Marcus Hulings deserved to enjoy a winter of old age as green\r\nas spring, as full of blossoms as summer, as generous as autumn. His\r\nson, Hon. Willis J. Hulings, served in the Legislature three terms. He\r\nintroduced the bills prohibiting railroad-discriminations and was a\r\nstrong debater on the floor. Senator Quay favored him for State\r\nTreasurer and attempted to stampede the convention which nominated\r\nWilliam Livsey. This was the beginning of the differences between Quay\r\nand the combine which culminated in the rout of the latter and the\r\ntriumph of the Beaver statesman in 1895-6. Mr. Hulings lives at Oil\r\nCity, has a beautiful home and is colonel of the Sixteenth Regiment of\r\nthe National Guards. He practiced law in 1877-81, then devoted his\r\nattention to oil-operations, to mining and lumbering, in which he is at\r\npresent actively engaged.\r\n\r\nJohn Lee drilled his first well on the Hoover farm, near Franklin, in\r\n1860, and he is operating to-day in Clinton and Rockland townships. He\r\nhas had his share of storm and sunshine, from dusters at Nickelville to\r\na slice of the Big Injun at Bullion, in the shifting panorama of\r\noil-developments for thirty-six years, but his fortitude and manliness\r\nnever flinched. He is no sour dyspeptic, whose conduct depends upon what\r\nhe eats for breakfast and who cannot believe the world is O. K. if he\r\ndrills a dry-hole occasionally.\r\n\r\nFrederick C. Plumer and John Lee, partners in the Clarion and Butler\r\nfields, were successful operators. Their wells on the Hummell farm\r\nnetted handsome returns. By a piece of clever strategy they secured the\r\nDiviner tract, drilled a well that extended the territory two miles\r\nsouth of Millerstown and sold out for ninety-thousand dollars. Plumer\r\nquit with a competence, purchased his former hardware-store at\r\nNewcastle, took a flyer in the Bullion district and died at Franklin,\r\nhis birthplace and boyhood home, in 1879. “Fred” was a thorough man of\r\naffairs, prompt, courteous, affable and popular. His long sickness was\r\nborne cheerfully and he faced the end—he died at thirty-one—without\r\nrepining. His wife and daughter have joined him in the land of deathless\r\nreunions.\r\n\r\n                            “Over the river!\r\n                Sailing on waters where lotuses smile,\r\n                Passing by many a tropical isle,\r\n                Sighting savannas there mile upon mile,\r\n                            Over the river!\r\n                Music forever and beauty for aye,\r\n                Sunlight unending—the sunlight and day,\r\n                Never a farewell to weep on the way,\r\n                            Over the river!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEAVER CREEK AT JEFFERSON FURNACE.]\r\n\r\nEast, north and west the area of prolific territory widened. Wells on\r\nthe Young farm started a jaunty development at Jefferson Furnace. Once\r\nthe scene of activity in iron-manufacture, the old furnace had been\r\nneglected for three decades. Oil awakened the spot from its\r\nRip-Van-Winkle slumber. A narrow-gauge railroad crossed Beaver Creek on\r\na dizzy trestle, which afforded an enticing view of derricks, streams,\r\nhills, dales, cleared farms and wooded slopes. The wells have pumped\r\nout, the railroad has been switched off and the stout furnace stands\r\nagain in its solitary dignity. James M. Guffey, J. T. Jones, Wesley\r\nChambers and other live operators kept branching out until Beaver City,\r\nMongtown, Mertina, Edenburg, Knox, Elk City, Fern City and Jerusalem,\r\nwith Cogley as a supplement, were the centers of a production that\r\naggregated ten-thousand barrels a day. The St. Lawrence well, on the\r\nBowers farm, a mile north of Edenburg, was finished in June of 1872 and\r\ndirected attention to Elk township. For two years it pumped sixty-nine\r\nbarrels a day, six days each week, the owners shutting it down on\r\nSunday. Previously Captain Hasson, of Oil City, and R. Richardson, then\r\nof Tarr Farm and now of Franklin, had drilled in the vicinity. Ten\r\ndusters north of the Bowers farm augured poorly for the St. Lawrence. It\r\ndisappointed the prophets of evil by striking a capital sand and\r\nproducing with a regularity surpassed only by one well on Cherry Run. It\r\nwas not “a lovely toy, most fiercely sought, that lost its charm by\r\nbeing caught.”\r\n\r\nThe St. Lawrence jumped the northern end of the Clarion district to the\r\nfront. Hundreds of wells ushered in new towns. Knox, on the Bowers farm,\r\nattained a post-office, a hardware store and a dozen dwellings, its\r\nproximity to Edenburg preventing larger growth. The cross-roads\r\ncollection of five houses and a store known as Edenburg progressed\r\nimmensely. John Mendenhall and J. I. Best’s farm-houses, ’Squire\r\nKribbs’s country-store and justice-mill, a blacksmith-shop and three\r\ndwellings constituted the place at the date of the St. Lawrence advent.\r\nThe nearest hotel—the Berlin House—was three miles northward. In six\r\nmonths the quiet village became a busy, hustling, prosperous town of\r\ntwenty-five hundred population. It had fine hotels, fine stores, banks\r\nand people whom a destructive fire—it eliminated two-thirds of the\r\nbuildings in one night—could not “send to the bench.” When the flames\r\nhad been subdued, a crowd of sufferers gathered at two o’clock in the\r\nmorning, sang “Home, Sweet Home,” and at seven were clearing away the\r\nembers to rebuild. Narrow-gauge railroads were built and the folks\r\ndidn’t scare at the cars. Elk City flung its antlers to the breeze two\r\nmiles east. Isaac N. Patterson—he is president of the Franklin Savings\r\nBank and a big operator in Indiana—had a creamy patch on the Kaiser\r\nfarm. Jerusalem’s first arrival—Guffey’s wells created it—was a Clarion\r\ndelegate with a tent and a cargo of liquids. He dealt the drink over a\r\nrough board, improvised as a counter, so briskly that his receipts in\r\ntwo days footed up seven-hundred dollars. He had no license, an officer\r\ngot on the trail and the vendor decamped. He is now advance-agent of a\r\npopular show, wears diamonds the size of walnuts and tells hosts of\r\noil-region stories. The Clarion field was not inflamed by enormous\r\ngushers, but the wells averaged nicely and possessed the cardinal virtue\r\nof enduring year after year. It is Old Sol, steady and persevering, and\r\nnot the flashing meteor, “a moment here, then gone forever,” that lights\r\nand heats the earth and is the fellow to bank upon.\r\n\r\nAn Edenburg mother fed her year-old baby on sliced cucumbers and milk,\r\nand then desired the prayers of the church “because the Lord took away\r\nher darling.” “How is the baby?” anxiously inquired one lady of another\r\nat Beaver City. “Oh, baby died last week, I thank you,” was the\r\nequivocal reply.\r\n\r\nSome of the oilmen were liberally endowed with the devotional sentiment.\r\nWhen the news of a blazing tank of oil at Mertina reached Edenburg, a\r\njolly operator telegraphed the fact to Oil City, with the addendum:\r\n“Everything has gone hellward.” A half-hour later came his second\r\ndispatch: “The oil is blazing, with big flames going heavenward.” Such a\r\nhappy blending of the infernal with the celestial is seldom witnessed in\r\nordinary business.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of some people in a crisis is a wonderful puzzle, sometimes\r\nfunnier than a pig-circus. At the St. Petersburg fire, which sent half\r\nthe town up in smoke, an old woman rescued from the Adams House, with a\r\nbag of money containing four-hundred dollars, was indignant that her\r\nfifty-cent spectacles had been left to burn. A male guest stormed over\r\nthe loss of his satchel, which a servant had carried into the street,\r\nand threatened a suit for damages. The satchel was found and opened. It\r\nhad a pair of dirty socks, two dirty collars, a comb and a toothbrush!\r\nThe man with presence of mind to throw his mother-in-law from the\r\nfourth-story window and carry a feather-pillow down stairs was not on\r\nhand. St. Petersburg had no four-story buildings.\r\n\r\nJohn Kiley and “Ed.” Callaghan headed a circle of jolly jokers at\r\nTriangle City and Edenburg. Hatching practical sells was their meat and\r\ndrink. One evening they employed a stranger to personate a constable\r\nfrom Clarion and arrest a pipe-line clerk for the paternity of a bogus\r\noffspring. In vain the astonished victim protested his innocence,\r\nalthough he acknowledged knowing the alleged mother of the alleged kid.\r\nThe minion of the law turned a deaf ear to his prayers for release, but\r\nconsented to let him go until morning upon paying a five-dollar note.\r\nThe poor fellow thought of an everlasting flight from Oildom and was\r\nleaving the room to pack up his satchel when the “constable” appeared\r\nwith a supply of fluids. The joke was explained and the crowd liquidated\r\nat the expense of the subject of their pleasantry. Kiley was an oilman\r\nand operated in the northern fields. Callaghan slung lightning in the\r\ntelegraph-office. He married at Edenburg and went to Chicago. His wife\r\nprocured a divorce and married a well-known Harrisburger.\r\n\r\nA letter from his feminine sweetness, advising him to hurry up if he\r\nwished her not to marry his rival, so flustrated an Edenburg druggist\r\nthat he imbibed a full tumbler of Jersey lightning. An irresistible\r\nlonging to lie down seized him and he stretched himself for a nap on a\r\nlounge in a room back of the store. John Kiley discovered the sleeping\r\nbeauty, spread a sheet over him and prepared for a little sport. He let\r\ndown the blinds, hung a piece of crape on the door and rushed out to\r\nannounce that “Jim” was dead. People flocked to learn the particulars.\r\nEntering the drug-store a placard met their gaze: “Walk lightly, not to\r\ndisturb the corpse!” They were next taken to the door of the rear\r\napartment, to see a pair of boots protruding from beneath a sheet.\r\nNobody was permitted to touch the body, on a plea that it must await the\r\ncoroner, but the friends were invited to drink to the memory of the\r\ndeceased pill-dispenser and suggest the best time for his funeral. Thus\r\nmatters continued two hours, when the “corpse” wakened up, kicked off\r\nthe sheet and walked out! His friends at first refused to recognize him,\r\ndeclaring the apparition was a ghost, but finally consented to renew the\r\nacquaintance upon condition that he “set ’em up” for the thirsty\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\nA Clarion operator, having to spend Sunday in New York, strayed into a\r\nfashionable church and was shown to a swell seat. Shortly after a\r\ngentleman walked down the aisle, glared at the stranger, drew a pencil\r\nfrom his pocket, wrote a moment and handed him a slip of paper\r\ninscribed, “This is my pew.” The unabashed Clarionite didn’t bluff a\r\nlittle bit. He wrote and handed back the paper: “It’s a darned nice pew.\r\nHow much rent do you ante up for it?” The New-Yorker saw the joke, sat\r\ndown quietly and when the service closed shook hands with the intruder\r\nand asked him to dinner. The acquaintance begun so oddly ripened into a\r\npoker-game next evening, at which the oilman won enough from the city\r\nclubman to pay ten years’ pew-rent. At parting he remarked: “Who’s in\r\nthe wrong pew now?” Then he whistled softly: “Let me off at Buffalo!”\r\n\r\nClarion’s products were not confined to prize pumpkins, mammoth corn and\r\noil-wells. The staunch county supplied the tallest member of the\r\nNational Guard, in the person of Thomas Near, twenty-one years old, six\r\nfeet eleven in altitudinous measurement and about twice the thickness of\r\na fence-rail. The Clarion company was mustered in at Meadville. General\r\nLatta’s look of astonishment as he surveyed the latitude and longitude\r\nof the new recruit was exceedingly comical. He rushed to Governor\r\nHartranft and whispered, “Where in the name of Goliath did you pick up\r\nthat young Anak?” At the next annual review Near stood at the end of the\r\nClarion column. A staff-officer, noticing a man towering a foot above\r\nhis comrades, spurred his horse across the field and yelled: “Get down\r\noff that stump, you blankety-blank son of a gun!” The tall boy did not\r\n“get down” and the enraged officer did not discover how it was until\r\nwithin a rod of the line. His chagrin rivaled that of Moses Primrose\r\nwith the shagreen spectacles. Poor Near, long in inches and short in\r\nyears, was not long for this world and died in youthful manhood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES M. GUFFEY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESLEY S. GUFFEY.]\r\n\r\nHon. James M. Guffey, one of Pennsylvania’s most popular and successful\r\ncitizens, began his career as a producer in the Clarion district. Born\r\nand reared on a Westmoreland farm, his business aptitude early\r\nmanifested itself. In youth he went south to fill a position under the\r\nsuperintendent of the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. The practical\r\ntraining was put to good use by the earnest young Pennsylvanian. Its\r\nopportunities for dash and energy to gain rich rewards attracted him to\r\nthe oil-region. Profiting by what he learned from the experiences of\r\nothers in Venango—a careful observer, he did not have to scorch himself\r\nto find out that fire is hot—he located at St. Petersburg in 1872.\r\nClarion was budding into prominence as a prospective oil-field. Handling\r\nwell-machinery as agent of the Gibbs & Sterrett Manufacturing Company\r\nbrought him into close relations with operators and operations in the\r\nnew territory. He improved his advantages, leased lands, secured\r\ninterests in promising farms, drilled wells and soon stepped to the\r\nfront as a first-class producer. Fortune smiled upon the plucky\r\nWestmorelander, whose tireless push and fearless courage cool judgment\r\nand sound discretion tempered admirably. While always ready to accept\r\nthe risks incident to producing oil and developing untried sections, he\r\nwas not a reckless plunger, going ahead blindly and not counting the\r\ncost. He decided promptly, moved forward resolutely and took nobody’s\r\ndust. Those who endeavored to keep up with him had to “ride the horse of\r\nPacolet” and travel fast. He invested in pipe-lines and local\r\nenterprises, helped every deserving cause, stood by his friends and his\r\nconvictions, believed in progress and acted strictly on the square. Not\r\none dollar of his splendid winnings came to him in a manner for which he\r\nneeds blush, or apologize or be ashamed to look any man on earth\r\nstraight in the face. He did not get his money at the expense of his\r\nconscience, of his self-respect, of his generous instincts or of his\r\nfellow-men. Of how many millionaires, in this age of shoddy and\r\nchicanery, of jobbery and corruption, of low trickery and inordinate\r\ndesire for wealth, can this be said?\r\n\r\nMr. Guffey is an ardent Democrat, but sensible voters of all classes\r\nwished him to represent them in Congress and gave him a superb send-off\r\nin the oil-portion of the Clarion district. Unfortunately the fossils in\r\nthe back-townships prevented his nomination. The uncompromising foe of\r\nring-rule, boss-domination and machine-crookedness, he is a leader of\r\nthe best elements of his party and not a noisy ward-politician. His\r\nvoice is potent in Democratic councils and his name is familiar in every\r\ncorner of the producing-regions. His oil-operations have reached to\r\nButler, Forest, Warren, McKean and Allegheny counties. He furnished the\r\ncash that unlocked the Kinzua pool and extended the Bradford field miles\r\nup Foster Brook. In company with John Galey, Michael Murphy and Edward\r\nJennings, he drilled the renowned Matthews well and owned the juiciest\r\nslice of the phenomenal McDonald field. He started developments in\r\nKansas, putting down scores of wells, erecting a refinery and giving the\r\nstate of Mary Ellen Lease a product drouths cannot blight nor\r\ngrasshoppers devour. He was largely instrumental in developing the\r\nnatural-gas fields of Western Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, heading\r\nthe companies that piped it into Pittsburg, Johnstown, Wheeling,\r\nIndianapolis and hundreds of small towns. He owns thousands of acres of\r\nthe famous gas-coal lands of his native county, vast coal-tracts in West\r\nVirginia and valuable reality in Pittsburg. He lives in a handsome house\r\nat East Liberty, brightened by a devoted wife and four children, and\r\ndispenses a bountiful hospitality. Quick to mature and execute his\r\nplans, he dispatches business with great celerity, keeping in touch\r\nconstantly with the details of his manifold enterprises. He is the soul\r\nof honor in his dealings, liberal in his benefactions and always\r\napproachable. His charm of manner, kindness of heart, keen intuition and\r\nrare geniality draw men to him and inspire their confidence and regard.\r\nHe is a striking personality, his lithe frame, alert movements, flowing\r\nhair, luxuriant mustache, rolling collar, streaming tie, frock-coat and\r\nbroad-brimmed hat suggesting General Custer. When at last the vital\r\nfires burn low, when his brave heart beats weak and slow, when the\r\nevening shadows lengthen and he enters the deepening dusk at the ending\r\nof many happy years, James M. Guffey will have lived a life worth living\r\nfor its worth to himself, to his family, to the community and to the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n               “The grass is softer to his tread\r\n                 For rest it yields unnumber’d feet;\r\n               Sweeter to him the wild rose red\r\n                 Because it makes the whole world sweet.”\r\n\r\nWesley S. Guffey, for many years a prominent operator, resembles his\r\nbrother in enterprise, activity and the manly qualities that win\r\nrespect. He owns scores of productive wells, and the firm of Guffey &\r\nQueen ranks high in the southern fields. He has labored zealously to\r\nsecure political reform and free Pittsburg, where he has his beautiful\r\nhome and office, from the odious thraldom of corrupt bossism. Unhappily\r\nthe last legislature defeated the efforts of good citizens in this\r\ndirection. Mr. Guffey is a fluent talker, knows lots of rich stories and\r\nreckons his friends by whole battalions. Pride and meanness he despises\r\nand “his word is his bond.” Another brother, John Guffey, has been\r\nsheriff of Westmoreland county and is a leading citizen. The Guffeys are\r\nmen to trust implicitly, to tie to, to swear by and to bank upon at all\r\ntimes and under all circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRY WETTER.]\r\n\r\nMajor Henry Wetter, the embodiment of honor and energy, was the largest\r\noperator in the Clarion district until swamped by the low price of oil.\r\nDeath overtook him while struggling against heavy odds to recuperate his\r\nhealth and fortune. How sad it is that the flower must die before the\r\nfruit can bloom. A terrible decline in oil-values caused his failure in\r\n1877 and compelled Merrick & Conley’s Edenburg bank to close.\r\n\r\n                    “I falter where I firmly trod.”\r\n\r\nEdenburg, in its prime the liveliest inland town the Clarion district\r\ncould boast, is in Beaver township, ten miles from Foxburg and Emlenton.\r\nIt was named by. J. G. Mendenhall, who located on a big farm and opened\r\nthe Eden Inn fifty years ago. Two farms, one two miles north and the\r\nother a mile south-west of his home-farm, he dubbed Jerusalem and Egypt\r\nrespectively. Mendenhall lived to see all three tracts productive\r\noil-territory, with a busy town occupying part of the central tract. J.\r\nI. Best, who died in 1880, was his early neighbor and P. F. Kribbs\r\nstarted a country-store opposite the Mendenhall homestead. In the spring\r\nof 1872 Balliet & Co. drilled a duster on the Best farm. Hahn & Co. had\r\nsimilar ill-luck on the Kiser farm, a mile south, following in the wake\r\nof W. J. Brundred’s dry-hole on the Eischelman tract a month previous.\r\nThe St. Lawrence strike changed the aspect of affairs and brought the\r\nterritory into notice. Wooden buildings were hurried up, wells were\r\nrushed through the sand, crowds thronged the streets and Edenburg became\r\nthe centre of attraction. Page Maplestone had the first hotel, to which\r\nRobert Orr quickly succeeded. The Winebrennerians had the first church,\r\nchased closely by the Methodists. Two banks, countless stores and shops,\r\nplenty of saloons, hundreds of houses and hosts of operators were soon\r\nin evidence. Knox, Elk City, Slam Bang, Wentling, Jefferson, Beaver and\r\nother suburban oil-towns put in an appearance. Ross Haney, D. J.\r\nWyncoop, Charles Lavens, A. J. Urquhart, Gray Brothers, G. M. Cushing,\r\nClark Hayes, B. F. Painter, J. D. Wolff, G. W. Moltz, Joseph E. Zuver,\r\nJames Travis, M. E. Hess, Charles Shaw and dozens of others were\r\nfamiliar figures. J. M. Gifford launched the _Herald_, J. Edd Leslie\r\nexploited the _Spirit_, Campbell Brothers loaded the _Oil-Times_ and Tom\r\nWhittaker fired off the malodorous _Gattling Gun_. Col. J. S. Brown\r\ndealt in real-estate and wrote breezily for the Oil-City _Derrick_. Sam\r\nMagee, M. M. Meredith and William Wirt Johnson practised law. Major J.\r\nB. Maitland managed the United Pipe-Lines and Goss Brothers owned the\r\nbest well in the diggings. Narrow-gauge railroads were built from\r\nEmlenton and Foxburg, a borough charter was obtained and 1877 saw the\r\ntown at its highest point. Severe fires scourged it frightfully, the\r\nButler field lured many of the operators and Edenburg relapsed into a\r\ntidy village.\r\n\r\nThomas McConnell, Smith K. Campbell, W. D. Robinson and Col. J. B.\r\nFinlay, of Kittanning, in 1860 purchased two acres of land on the west\r\nbank of the Allegheny, ninety rods above Tom’s Run, from Elisha\r\nRobinson. Organizing the Foxburg Oil-Company of sixteen shares, they\r\ndrilled a well four-hundred-and-sixty feet. An obstruction delayed work\r\na few days, the war broke out and the well was abandoned. The same\r\nparties paid Robinson five-thousand dollars in 1865 for one-hundred\r\nacres and sold thirty to Philadelphia capitalists. The latter formed the\r\nClarion and Allegheny-River Oil-Company and sunk a well which struck oil\r\non October tenth, the first produced in the upper end of Armstrong\r\ncounty and the beginning of the Parker development. Venango was drooping\r\nand operators sought the southern trail. The Robinson farm was not\r\nperforated as quickly as “you could say Jack Robinson,” the owners\r\nchoosing not to cut it into small leases, but other tracts were seized\r\neagerly. Drilled deeper, the original Robinson well was utterly dry! Had\r\nit been finished in 1860-1 the territory might have been condemned and\r\nthe Parker field never heard of!\r\n\r\nJohn Galey’s hundred-barrel well, drilled in 1869 on the island above\r\nParker, relieved the monotony of commonplace strikes—twenty to fifty\r\nbarrels—on the Robinson and adjacent farms and elevated the district to\r\nthe top rung of the ladder. Parker’s Landing—a ferry and a dozen\r\nhouses—named from a pioneer settler, ambled merrily to the head of the\r\nprocession. The center of operations that stretched into Butler county\r\nand demonstrated the existence of three greasy streaks, Parker speedily\r\nbecame a red-hot town of three-thousand inhabitants. Hotels, stores,\r\noffices, banks and houses crowded the strip of land at the base of the\r\nsteep cliff, surged over the hill, absorbed the suburbs of Lawrenceburg\r\nand Farrentown and proudly wore the title of “Parker City.” Hosts of\r\ncapital fellows made life a perpetual whirl of business and jollity.\r\nOperators of every class and condition, men of eminent ability,\r\nindomitable hustlers, speculators, gamblers and adventurers thronged the\r\nstreets. It was the vim and spice and vigor of Oil City, Rouseville,\r\nPetroleum Centre and Pithole done up in a single package. A hundred of\r\nthe liveliest laddies that ever capered about a “bull-ring” traded jokes\r\nand stories and oil-certificates at the Oil-Exchange. Two fires\r\nobliterated nine-tenths of the town, which was never wholly rebuilt.\r\nDevelopments tended southward for years and the sun of Parker set\r\nfinally when Bradford’s rose in the northern sky. The bridge and a few\r\nbuildings have held on, but the banks have wound up their accounts, the\r\nmultitudes have dispersed, the residence-section of the cliff is a waste\r\nand the glory of Parker a tradition. As the ghost of Hamlet’s father\r\nobserved concerning the bicycle academy, where beginners on wheels were\r\nplentiful: “What a falling off was there!”\r\n\r\nGaley leased lands, sunk wells and sold to Phillips Brothers for a\r\nmillion dollars. He played a strong hand in Butler and Allegheny and\r\nremoved to Pittsburg, his present headquarters. He possessed nerve,\r\nenergy and endurance and, like the country-boy applying for a job, “wuz\r\njam’d full ov day’s work.” He would lend a hand to tube his wells, lay\r\npipes, move a boiler or twist the tools. There wasn’t a lazy bone in his\r\nanatomy. Rain, mud, storm or darkness had no terrors for the bold rider,\r\nwho bestrode a raw-boned horse and “took Time by the forelock.” A young\r\nlady from New York, whose father was interested with Galey in a tract of\r\noil-land, accompanied him on one of his visits to Millerstown. She had\r\nheard a great deal about her father’s partner and the producers, whom\r\nshe imagined to be clothed in broadcloth and diamonds. When the stage\r\nfrom Brady drew up at the Central Hotel a gorgeous chap was standing on\r\nthe platform. He sported a stunning suit, a huge gold-chain, a\r\ndiamond-pin and polished boots, the whole outfit got up regardless of\r\nexpense. “Oh, papa, I see a producer! That must be Mr. Galey,” exclaimed\r\nthe girl as this prototype of the dude met her gaze. The father glanced\r\nat the object, recognized him as a neighboring bar-tender and spoiled\r\nhis daughter’s fanciful notion by the curt rejoinder: “That blamed fool\r\nis a gin-slinger!” Butler had long been a sort of by-word for poverty\r\nand meanness, the settlers going by the nickname of “Buckwheats.” This\r\nwas an unjust imputation, as the simple people were kind, honest and\r\nindustrious, in these respects presenting a decided contrast to some of\r\nthe new elements in the wake of the petroleum-development. The New-York\r\nvisitor drove out in the afternoon to meet his business-associate. A\r\nmile below the Diviner farm a man on horseback was seen approaching. Mud\r\ncovered the panting steed and his rider. The young lady, anxious to show\r\nhow much she knew about the country, hazarded another guess. “Oh! papa,”\r\nshe said earnestly, “I’m sure that’s a Buckwheat!” The father chuckled,\r\nnext moment greeted the rider warmly and introduced him to his\r\nastonished daughter as “My partner, Mr. Galey!” A hearty laugh followed\r\nthe father’s version of the day’s incidents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN H. GALEY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES M. LAMBING.]\r\n\r\nJohn H. Galey has been engaged in oil-operations for a generation.\r\nComing from Clarion county to Oil Creek in the sixties, he participated\r\nin the Pithole excitement, drilled a test-well that broadened the\r\nPleasantville field and started the Parker furore with his\r\nisland-strike. He is every inch a petroleum-pioneer. To him belongs the\r\nhonor of ushering in various new districts in Pennsylvania and the\r\noil-developments in Kansas and Texas. Well-earned success has rewarded\r\nhis persistent, indomitable energy. He owns a fat slice of the finest\r\nsilver-mine in Idaho and holds a large stake in California, Colorado and\r\nNova-Scotia gold-mines. Mr. Galey is thoroughly practical and\r\ncompanionable, has traveled much and observed closely, nor can any excel\r\nhim in narrating reminiscences and experiences of life in the\r\noil-regions.\r\n\r\nJohn McKeown drilled on the Farren hill and the slopes bordering the\r\nnorth bank of Bear Creek. Glory Hole popped up on B. B. Campbell’s\r\nBear-Creek farm. Campbell-bluff, whole-souled “Ben”—is a Pittsburg\r\ncapitalist, big in body and mind, outspoken and independent. “The\r\nCampbells are coming” could not have found a better herald. He produced\r\nlargely, bought stacks of farms, refined and piped oil and was an\r\nimportant factor in the Armstrong-Butler development. At the Ursa Major\r\nwell, the first on the farm, large casing and heavy tools were first\r\nused, with gratifying results. “Charley” Cramer juggled the temper-screw\r\nand laughed at the chaps who solemnly predicted the joints would not\r\nstand the strain and the engine would not jerk the tools out of the\r\nhole. The tool-dresser on Cramer’s “tower”—drilling went on night and\r\nday, each “tower” lasting twelve hours and the men changing at noon and\r\nmidnight—was A. M. Lambing, now the learned and zealous parish-priest at\r\nBraddock. The well, completed in June of 1871 and good for a hundred\r\nbarrels, was owned by James M. Lambing, to whom more than any other man\r\nthe world is indebted for the extension of the Butler field.\r\n\r\nBorn in Armstrong county, in 1861 young Lambing concluded to invest some\r\ntime and labor—his sole capital—in a well at the mouth of Tubb’s Run,\r\ntwo miles above Tionesta. A dry-hole was the poor reward of his efforts.\r\nEnlisting in the Eighty-third Regiment, he received disabling injuries,\r\nwas discharged honorably, returned to Forest county in 1863,\r\nsuperintended the Denver Petroleum-Company, dealt in real estate and in\r\n1866 commenced operating at Tidioute. A vein of bad luck in 1867\r\nexhausting his last dollar, he sold his gold-watch and chain to pay the\r\nwages of his drillers. Facing the future bravely, he worked by the day,\r\ncontracted to bore wells at Pleasantville, Church Run, Shamburg and Red\r\nHot and bore up cheerfully during three years of adversity. In the\r\nwinter of 1869 he traded an engine for an interest in a well at Parker\r\nthat smelled of oil. For another interest he drilled the Wilt & Crawford\r\nwell and secured leases on Tom’s Run. His Pharos, Gipsy Queen and Lady\r\nMary wells enabled him to strike out boldly. In company with his\r\nbrother—John A. Lambing—C. D. Angell and B. B. Campbell, he ventured\r\nbeyond the prescribed limits to the Campbell, Morrison and Gibson farms.\r\nHe “wildcatted” farther south, at times with varying success, pointing\r\nthe way to Modoc and Millerstown. Reverses beset him temporarily, but\r\nhope and courage and integrity remained and he recovered the lost\r\nground. Charitable, enterprising and sincere, no truer, squarer, manlier\r\nman than James M. Lambing ever marched in the grand cavalcade of\r\nPennsylvania oil-producers. He and John A. retired from the business\r\nyears ago to engage in other pursuits. James M. settled at Corry and\r\nserved so capably as mayor that the citizens wanted to elect him for\r\nlife. His noble, womanly wife, a real helpmeet always, made his\r\nhospitable home an earthly paradise. He had an office in Pittsburg and\r\ncustomers for his Ajax machinery wherever oil is produced. He died in\r\nJanuary, 1897. “Who can blot his name with any just reproach?”\r\n\r\nCounselled by “spirits,” Abram James selected a block of land on Blyson\r\nRun, twenty miles up the Clarion River, as the location of a rich\r\npetroleum-field. His luck at Pleasantville induced numbers to believe\r\nhim an infallible oil-smeller. The test-well that was to deluge Blyson\r\nwith crude was bored eighteen-hundred feet. It had no sand or oil and\r\nthe tools were stuck in the hole! The “spirits” couldn’t have missed the\r\nmark more widely if they had directed James to mine for gold in a\r\nsnow-bank.\r\n\r\nThe Big-Injun well at Bullion, owned originally by Prentice, Wheeler &\r\nCrawford, was located in the center of a wheat-patch by William R.\r\nCrawford, of Franklin, a member of the firm. His opinion carried against\r\nthe choice of his partners, who preferred a spot fifteen rods eastward,\r\nwhere a well drilled later was “dry as a powder-horn.” The direction\r\n“Smiley’s Frog” might happen to jump was less uncertain than the outcome\r\nof many a Bullion well before the tools pierced the sand to the last\r\nfoot and settled the matter positively.\r\n\r\nOn October third, 1875, the boiler at the Goss well, J. I. Best farm,\r\nexploded, fatally injuring Alonzo Goss and instantly killing A. Wilson,\r\nthe man in charge.\r\n\r\nThe first pipe-line in Clarion County was laid in 1871, by Martin &\r\nHarms, on lands of the Fox estate. In October of 1877 the Rev. Dr.\r\nNewman, President Grant’s pastor in Washington, dedicated the second\r\nchurch the Methodists built at Edenburg. Fire cremated the structure and\r\nseriously damaged the third one on the site in 1879. Probably no other\r\ntown of its size on the face of the earth has suffered so repeatedly and\r\ndisastrously at the hands of incendiaries as Edenburg. The third great\r\nconflagration, on October thirteenth, 1878, destroyed two-hundred\r\nbuildings and thirteen oil-wells.\r\n\r\nSad accidents happened before drillers learned how to manage a flowing\r\noil-well with casing in it. At Frank Fertig’s well, Antwerp, a man was\r\nburned to death. The burning of the Shoup & Vensel well at Turkey City\r\ncost three lives and led to an indignation-meeting at St. Petersburg to\r\nprotest against casing. Danger from its use was soon removed by Victor\r\nGretter’s invention of the oil-saver. Gretter, a small, dark-haired,\r\ndark-eyed man, lived at St. Petersburg. He was an inventive genius and a\r\njoker of the first water. His oil-saver doubtless saved many lives, by\r\npreventing gas and oil from escaping when a vein was tapped and coming\r\nin contact with the tool-dresser’s fire in the derrick.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Kissinger, a pioneer settler, died in 1880 at the age of\r\neighty-five. He was the father of thirty-four children, nine of whom\r\nperished by his dwelling taking fire during the absence of the parents\r\nfrom home. His second wife, who survived him ten years, weighed\r\nthree-hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nLillian Edgarton, the plump and talented platform-speaker, was billed to\r\nappear at Franklin. She traveled from Pittsburg by rail. A Parker broker\r\nwas a passenger on the train and wired to the oil-exchange that Josie\r\nMansfield was on board. The news flew and five-hundred men stood on the\r\nplatform when the train arrived. The broker jumped off and said the lady\r\nhad a seat near the center of the coach he had just left. The boys\r\nclimbed on the car-platform, opened the door and marched in single file\r\nalong the aisle to get a look at “Josie.” The conductor tore his hair in\r\nanguish that the train would not carry such a crowd as struggled to get\r\non, but he was dumbfounded when the long procession began to get off.\r\nThe sell was not discovered until next morning, by which time the author\r\nof the joke had started on his summer-vacation and could not be reached\r\nby the vigilance-committee.\r\n\r\nDown the zig-zagged stream proved to not a few operators a pleasant\r\nvoyage to wealth and to others the direct road to disaster. Venango,\r\nClarion and Armstrong counties had been explored, with Butler on deck to\r\nsurprise mankind by the extent and richness of its amazing territory.\r\n\r\n                       WHERE IGNORANCE IS BLISS.\r\n\r\nThe first building at Triangle bore in bold letters and bad spelling a\r\nsign labeled “Tryangle Hotel.”\r\n\r\n“A Black Justice of the Peace” ran the off-color legend, painted by an\r\nartist not up in punctuation, on the weather-beaten sign of ’Squire\r\nBlack, at Shippenville.\r\n\r\nAn honest Dutchman near Turkey City declined to lease his farm at\r\none-fourth royalty, insisting upon _one-eighth_ as the very lowest he\r\nwould accept. He did not discover that one-eighth was not twice\r\none-fourth until he received his first instalment of oil, when he fired\r\noff the simple expletive, “Kreutzmillionendonnerwetter!”\r\n\r\nA farmer rather shy on grammar, who represented Butler county in the\r\nLegislature at the outset of developments around Petrolia, “brought down\r\nthe house” and a unanimous appropriation by his maiden-speech: “Feller\r\ncitizens, if we’uns up to Butler county wuz yu’uns down to Harrisburg\r\nwe’uns would give yu’uns what we’uns is after!”\r\n\r\nAt Oil City in 1863-4 J. B. Allen, of Michigan, a first-class chemist,\r\nhad charge of the prescription-department in Dr. Colbert and Dr.\r\nEgbert’s drug-store. He could read Greek as readily as English, declaim\r\nin Latin by the hour, quote from any of the classics and speak three or\r\nfour modern languages. To raise money to pay off a mortgage on his\r\nfather’s farm he walked across the Allegheny on a wire thirty feet above\r\nthe water. He carried a large flag, attached to a frame mounted on a\r\npulley-wheel, which he shoved with one hand, holding a balance-pole in\r\nthe other. It was a feat Blondin could not excel. Allen was decidedly\r\neccentric and the hero of unnumbered stories. Once a mud-bespattered\r\nhorseman rushed into the store with a prescription that called for a\r\ndeadly poison. The horseman was informed it was not safe to fill it, but\r\nhe insisted upon having it, saying it bore a prominent doctor’s\r\nsignature and there could be no mistake. Allen filled it and wrote on\r\nthe label: “Caution—If any damphool takes this prescription it will kill\r\nhim as dead as the devil!”\r\n\r\nGeneral Reed, of Erie, the largest vessel-owner on the lakes,\r\nrepresented his district in Congress and desired a second term. The\r\nDemocrats nominated Judge Thompson and Clarion county was the pivot upon\r\nwhich the election turned. The contest waxed furious. Near its close the\r\ntwo candidates brought up at a big meeting in the wilds of Clarion to\r\ndebate. Lumbermen and furnacemen were out in force. Reed led off and on\r\nthe homestretch told the people how he loved them and their county. He\r\nhad built the fastest craft on the lakes and named the vessel Clarion.\r\nAs the craft sailed from Buffalo to Erie, and from Cleveland to Detroit,\r\nand from Saginaw to Mackinaw, to Oconomowoc and Manitowoc, Oshkosh,\r\nMilwaukee and Chicago, in every port she folded her white wings and told\r\nof the county that honored him with a seat in Congress. The people were\r\nuntutored in nautical affairs and listened with rapt attention. As the\r\nGeneral closed his speech the enthusiasm was unbounded. Things looked\r\nblue for Judge Thompson. After a few moments required to get the\r\naudience out of the seventh heaven of rapture, he stepped to the front\r\nof the platform, leaned over it, motioned to the crowd to come up close\r\nand said: “Citizens of Clarion, what General Reed has told you is true.\r\nHe has built a brig and a grand one. But where do you suppose he painted\r\nthe proud name of Clarion?” Turning to General Reed, he said: “Stand up\r\nhere, sir, and tell these honest people where you had the painter put\r\nthe name of Clarion. You never thought the truth would reach back here.\r\nI shall tell these people the truth and I challenge you to deny one word\r\nof it. Yes, fellow-citizens, he painted the proud name of Clarion under\r\nthe stern of the brig—under her stern, gentlemen!” The indignation of\r\nthe people found vent in groans and curses. General Reed sat stunned and\r\nspeechless. No excuses would be accepted and the vote of proud Clarion\r\nmade Judge Thompson a Congressman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HASCAL L.

All eyes turned instinctively southward, believing the next\r\ncenter of activity lay in that direction. The Israelites scanning the\r\nhorizon for a glimpse of the promised land were less earnest and\r\nanxious. Butler, not Canaan, was on everybody’s lips. “On to Richmond,”\r\nthe frenzied cry during the civil war, appeared in the new dress of “On\r\nto Butler!” For a time, just to catch breath for the supreme movement,\r\noperators groped their way cautiously. But Napoleon scaled the Alps and\r\nthe advance-couriers of the coming host of oilmen climbed Farren Hill\r\nand the slopes beyond. Julius Cæsar crossed the Rubicon in days of old,\r\nso Campbell and Lambing in 1871 crossed Bear Creek, three miles\r\nsouth-west of Parker, to plant the tall derricks which signified that\r\nthe invasion of Butler by the petroleumites was about to begin and to be\r\ncarried through to a finish. With Richard each of the bold invaders\r\nmight declare:\r\n\r\n                “I have set my life upon a cast,\r\n                And I will stand the hazard of the die.”\r\n\r\nButler, the county-seat of Butler county, was laid out in 1802 by the\r\nCunninghams, two brothers from Lancaster, who repose in the old\r\ncemetery. The surveyor was David Dougall, who lived seventy-five years\r\nalone, in a shanty near the court-house, dying at ninety-eight. He owned\r\na row of tumble-down frames on the public-square, eye-sores to the\r\ncommunity, but would not sell lest his poor tenants might suffer by a\r\nchange of proprietors! His memory of local events was marvelous. He\r\nwalked from Detroit through the forest to Butler, following an Indian\r\ntrail, and remembered when Pittsburg had only three brick-buildings. He\r\nwas agent of the McCandless family and once consented to spend a night\r\nat the mansion of his friends in Pittsburg. To do honor to the occasion\r\nhe wore trousers made of striped bed-ticking. Fearing fire, he would not\r\nsleep up-stairs and a bed was provided in the parlor. About midnight an\r\nalarm sounded. Dougall jumped up, grabbed his shoes and hat and walked\r\nhome-thirty-three miles-before breakfast. He was an eccentric bachelor\r\nand had his coffin ready for years. It was constructed of oak, grown on\r\none of his farms, which he willed to a friend upon condition that the\r\nlegatee buried him at the foot of a particular tree and kept a\r\nnight-watchman at his grave one year. He was the last of his race and\r\nthe last survivor of the bold pioneers to whom Butler owed its\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTLER COUNTY]\r\n\r\nWell-known operators figured in the vicinity of Bear Creek. Joseph Overy\r\ndrilled rows of good wells, pushed south and founded the town embalmed\r\nas St. Joe in compliment to its progenitor. Marcus Brownson—he was\r\nactive in Venango and McKean and died at Titusville—had a walkover on\r\nthe Walker farm, a mile in advance. On Donnelly’s eleven-hundred acres,\r\noffered in 1868 for six-thousand-dollars, scores of medium wells yielded\r\nfrom 1871 to 1878. S. D. Karns drained the Morrison farm and John\r\nMcKeown hit the “sucker-rod belt”—so called from its extreme\r\nnarrowness—near Martinsburg. Ralph Brothers tickled the sand on the\r\nSheakley farm. Up the stream operations jogged and Argyle City sprouted\r\non the hillside. Two miles ahead, upon the line dividing the Jameson and\r\nBlaney farms, Dimick, Nesbit & Co. finished a wildcat well on April\r\nseventeenth, 1892. This was the noted Fanny Jane—gallantly named in\r\nhonor of a pretty girl—which pumped one-hundred barrels and gave birth\r\nto Petrolia, seven miles south by west of Parker. George H. Dimick,\r\nexamining lands in Fairview township, Butler county, decided that a\r\nnatural basin at the junction of South Bear Creek and Dougherty Run was\r\noil-territory. Fifty men were raising a barn on the Campbell farm,\r\noverlooking this basin. Proceeding to the spot, he proposed to drill a\r\ntest well if the owners of the soil would lease enough land to warrant\r\nthe undertaking. Terms were agreed upon which secured twenty acres of\r\nthe Blaney farm, sixteen of the Jameson, ten of the W. A. Wilson, ten of\r\nthe James Wilson and ten of the Graham, at one-eighth royalty. The\r\nnearest producing wells at that date were three miles north. The Fanny\r\nJane stirred the blood of the oil-clans. The moving mass began to-arrive\r\nin May and by July two-thousand people had their home at Petrolia.\r\n\r\nA charter was obtained and Mr. Dimick was chosen burgess at the first\r\nborough-election, in February of 1873. The town expanded like the turnip\r\nLongfellow said “grew and it grew and it grew all it was able.” Hotels,\r\nstores, shops and offices lined the valley and dwellings crowned the\r\nhills. A narrow-gauge railroad from Parker was built in 1874, extended\r\nto Karns City and Millerstown and ultimately to Butler. Fisher Brothers\r\npaid sixty-thousand dollars for the Blaney farm and wells multiplied in\r\nall directions. A dog-fight or a street-scrap would gather hundreds of\r\nspectators. The Argyle Savings Bank handled hundreds-of-thousands of\r\ndollars daily. Ben Hogan erected a big opera-house and May Marshall was\r\nthe Cora Pearl of the frail sisterhood. R. W. Cram ran the post-office\r\nand news-room. “Steve” Harley wafted newsy items to the newspapers. Dr.\r\nFrank H. Johnston, now of Franklin, was the first physician. Kindred\r\nspirits met at “Sam” McBride’s drug-store and Peter Christie’s Central\r\nHotel. Poor “Sam,” “Dave” Mosier, H. L. McCance and S. S. Avery are in\r\ntheir graves and others have wandered nobody knows whither. Petrolia\r\ncontinued the metropolis four years and then dropped out of the game.\r\nSome straggling houses and left-over derricks alone remain of the\r\ngayest, sprightliest, hottest, busiest town that bloomed and withered in\r\nold Butler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD JENNINGS\r\n  GEO NESBIT      S. D. KARNS.\r\n  GEORGE DIMICK\r\n]\r\n\r\nGeorge H. Dimick, the son of a Wisconsin farmer and sire of Petrolia, is\r\nliberally stocked with the never-say-die qualities of the breezy\r\nWesterner. At nineteen he taught a Milwaukee school, landed on Oil Creek\r\nin 1860 and was appointed superintendent of the two Buchanan farms by\r\nRouse & Mitchell. He drilled on his own account in the spring of 1861,\r\naided in settling the Rouse estate, enrolled as a private in “Scott’s\r\nNine-Hundred” and came out a captain at the close of the war. In May of\r\n1865 he bent his footsteps towards Pithole, sold lands for the United\r\nStates Petroleum-Company and drilled eleven dry-holes on the McKinney\r\nfarm! Interests in the Poole, Grant, Eureka and Burchill spouters offset\r\nthese losses and added thousands of dollars a week to his wealth.\r\nStaying at Pithole too long, values had shrunk to such a degree that he\r\nwas virtually penniless at his departure from the “Magic City” in 1867.\r\nA whaling voyage of fifteen months in the Arctic seas and a sojourn at\r\nhis boyhood home improved his health and he returned in time to share in\r\nthe Pleasantville excitement. He located at Parker’s Landing in 1871 as\r\npartner of McKinney & Nesbit in the sale of oil-well supplies. He\r\noperated in the Parker field, at St. Petersburg, Petrolia, Greece City\r\nand Slippery Rock. Disposing of his properties in these localities, he\r\nand Captain Peter Grace drilled the wildcat-well that opened Cherry\r\nGrove and paralyzed the market in 1882. He had been active at Bradford\r\nand the middle field felt the influence of his shrewd movements. He has\r\nkept abreast of developments in the southern districts, sometimes\r\ngetting several lengths ahead. He is now interested in West Virginia and\r\nKentucky. Those who know his quick perception, his executive ability and\r\nhis intense love for opening new fields would not wonder to hear of his\r\nstriking a gusher at Oshkosh or Kamtschatka. Mr. Dimick is a man of\r\nactive temperament, high character and sturdy industry, a genuine\r\npathfinder and tireless explorer.\r\n\r\nAn Erie boy of fifteen when he left his father’s house for the\r\noil-region in 1862, George H. Nesbit first fired a still in a Titusville\r\nrefinery and in 1863 engaged with Dinsmore Brothers at Tarr Farm. He\r\nbuilt a small refinery at Shaffer, sold it in 1864 and in the spring of\r\n1865 drilled wells for himself on Benninghoff and Cherry-Tree Runs. He\r\nspent two years at Pithole, gaining a fortune and remaining until the\r\ncollapse swallowed the bulk of his profits. He operated at Pioneer in\r\n1867 and a year later at Pleasantville. He and George H. Dimick\r\nprospected in 1869 for oil-belts and fresh territory, located rich\r\nleases on Hickory Creek and established the line of the Venture well at\r\nFagundas. In 1870 Nesbit moved to Parker and, in company with John L.\r\nMcKinney, sold oil-well machinery and oil-lands. McKinney & Nesbit\r\ndrilled along Bear Creek, especially on the Black and Dutchess farms,\r\nprospering greatly. The firm ranked with the most enterprising and\r\nrealized large returns from wells at St. Petersburg and Parker. Dimick &\r\nNesbit, with Mr. McKinney as their associate, opened the Petrolia field\r\nin 1872. William Lardin, the contractor of the Fanny Jane, bought\r\nMcKinney’s interest in the well and leases. The three partners were\r\nright in the swim, their first six wells at Petrolia yielding them a\r\nthousand barrels a day. Nesbit bought the Patton farm, below town, in\r\n1872 for twenty-thousand dollars, selling five-eighths. Five third-sand\r\nwells ranged from thirty to one-hundred barrels and oil ruled at three\r\nto five dollars. The fourth-sand was found in 1873, and in January of\r\n1874 Nesbit & Lardin struck a thousand-barrel gusher on the Patton. The\r\nfarm paid enormously and Nesbit became an “oil-prince.” He developed\r\nhundreds of acres and displayed masterly tact. His check was good for a\r\nhalf-million any day and his luck was so remarkable that, had he fallen\r\ninto the river, probably he would not have been wet. He paid the highest\r\nwages and met his bills at sight. He entered the oil-exchange at Parker,\r\nfor a time was a high-roller and ended a bankrupt! The desk on which he\r\nwrote his bold, round signature on checks aggregating many\r\nhundred-thousand dollars was stored away among shocks of corn and\r\nsheaves of oats in the weather-stained barn on the Patton farm. J. N.\r\nIreland bought the tract for seven-thousand dollars. Nesbit drifted\r\nabout aimlessly, heard from occasionally at Macksburg and fetching up at\r\nlast in Cincinnati. His prestige was gone, his star had waned and he\r\nnever “caught on” again. He was no sluggard in business, no dullard in\r\nsociety, no niggard with money, no laggard in the petroleum-column.\r\nSurely the oil-region has furnished its full allotment of sad romances\r\nfrom real life. Nesbit died July eighth, 1897.\r\n\r\n            “Time, with a face like a mystery,\r\n            And hands as busy as hands can be,\r\n            Sits at the loom with its warp outspread,\r\n            To catch in its meshes each glancing thread.\r\n            Click, click! there’s a thread of love wove in!\r\n            Click, click! and another of wrong and sin!\r\n            What a checkered thing this web will be\r\n            When we see it unrolled in eternity!”\r\n\r\nJames E. Brown, to whom Nesbit sold one-quarter of the Patton farm, made\r\nhis mark upon the industries of the state. A carpenter’s son, he started\r\na store on the site of Kittanning, saved money, purchased lands and at\r\nhis death in 1880 left his family four-millions. He manufactured iron at\r\nvarious furnaces and owned a big block of stock in the rolling-mills at\r\nEast Brady. Samuel J. Tilden was a stockholder in the works, which\r\nemployed sixteen hundred men, turned out the first T-rails west of the\r\nAlleghenies and tottered to their fall in 1874. Mr. Brown cleared\r\neight-hundred-thousand dollars in 1872 by the advance in iron. He owned\r\noil-farms in Butler county, took stock in the Parker Bridge, the Parker\r\n& Karns City Railroad and the Karns Pipe-Line Company and conducted a\r\nbank at Kittanning. His granddaughter, Miss Findley, who inherited half\r\nhis wealth, married Lord Linton, a British baronet. The aged banker—he\r\nstuck it out to eighty-two—knew how to pile up money.\r\n\r\nStephen Duncan Karns, who had a railroad and a town named in his honor,\r\nwas a picturesque figure in the Armstrong-Butler district. With his two\r\nuncles he operated the first West-Virginia well, at the mouth of\r\nBurning-Spring Run, in 1860. His experience at his father’s Tarentum\r\nsalt-wells enabled him to run engine, to sharpen tools and clean out an\r\nold salt-well to be tested for oil. The well pumped forty barrels a day\r\nduring the winter of 1860-1. Fort Sumter was bombarded, several Kanawha\r\noperators were killed and young Karns escaped by night in a canoe. He\r\nenlisted, served three years, led his company at Antietam and\r\nChancellorsville and in 1866 leased one acre at Parker’s Landing from\r\nFullerton Parker. His first well, starting at one barrel a day, by\r\nmonths of pumping was increased to twelve barrels and earned him\r\ntwenty-thousand dollars. From the Miles Oil-Company of New York he\r\nleased a farm and an abandoned well a mile below Parker. He drilled the\r\nwell through the sand and it produced twenty-five barrels a day. This\r\nsettled the question of oil south of Parker. “Dunc,” as he was usually\r\ncalled by his friends, leased the Farren farm, drilled on Bear Creek,\r\nsecured the famous Stonehouse farm of three-hundred acres and in 1872\r\nenjoyed an income of five-thousand dollars a day! A mile south of\r\nPetrolia, on the McClymonds farm, Cooper Brothers were about to give up\r\ntheir first well as a hopeless duster. Karns thought the hole not deep\r\nenough, bought the property, resumed drilling and in two days the well\r\nwas flowing one-hundred barrels! The town of Karns City blossomed into a\r\ncommunity of twenty-five-hundred people, with three big hotels, stores,\r\noffices and dwellings galore. It fell a prey to the flames eventually.\r\nThe McClymonds, Riddle and J. B. Campbell farms doubled “Dunc’s” big\r\nincome for many moons. He had the second well at Greece City and for a\r\nyear or more was the largest producer in the oil-region. He built a\r\npipe-line from Karns City to Harrisburg to fight the United Lines, held\r\nfifty-five-thousand dollars’ stock in the Parker Bridge and controlled\r\nthe Parker & Karns-City Railroad and the Exchange Bank.\r\n\r\nNear Freeport, on the Allegheny River, thirty miles above Pittsburg, he\r\nlassoed a great farm and erected a fifty-thousand-dollar mansion.\r\nFourteen race-horses fed in his palatial stables. Guests might bathe in\r\nchampagne and the generous host spent money royally. A good strike or a\r\npoint gained meant a general jollification. He played billiards\r\nskillfully, handled cards expertly and wagered heavily on anything that\r\nhit his fancy. He and his wife were in Paris during the siege. Upon his\r\nreturn from Europe he built the Fredericksburg & Orange Railroad, in\r\nVirginia. The glut of crude from Butler wells dropped the price in 1874\r\nto forty cents. Losses of different kinds cramped Karns and the man\r\nworth three-millions in 1872-3 was obliged to surrender his stocks and\r\nlands and wells and begin anew! James E. Brown secured Glen-Karns, the\r\nbeautiful home below Freeport. In 1880 Karns induced E. O. Emerson, the\r\nwealthy Titusville producer, to start a cattle-ranch in Western\r\nColorado. For six years he superintended the herds on the immense\r\nplains, joining the round-ups, sleeping on the ground with the boys,\r\nroping and branding cattle and accumulating a stock of health and muscle\r\nwhich he thinks will carry him to the hundred-year mark. Emerson had\r\nbought from Karns the Riddle farm for eleven-thousand dollars. He\r\ndeepened one well—supposed dry—to the fourth sand. It flowed six-hundred\r\nbarrels and Emerson sold the tract in sixty days for ninety-thousand\r\ndollars. Karns returned from the west, practiced law a short while in\r\nPhiladelphia and for some years has managed a Populist paper at\r\nPittsburg. He ran against John Dalzell for Congress and walked at the\r\nhead of the parade when General Coxey’s “Army of the Commonweal” marched\r\nthrough the Smoky City. He enjoyed making money more than handling it,\r\nwas honorable in his dealings, intensely active, comprehensive in his\r\nviews and positive in his opinions. His “yes” or “no” was given\r\npromptly. “Dunc” is of slender build and nervous temperament, easy in\r\nhis manners, frank in his utterances and not scared by spooks in\r\npolitics or trade. He had his share of light and shade, struggle and\r\ntriumph, defeat and victory, incident and adventure in his pilgrimage.\r\n\r\n                         “How chances mock,\r\n                 And changes fill the cup of alteration\r\n                 With divers liquors!”\r\n\r\nRichard Jennings, over whose head the grass and flowers are growing, and\r\nhis brother-in-law, the late Jacob L. Meldren, did much to develop the\r\nterritory east of Petrolia. Coming from England to Armstrong county a\r\nhalf-century ago, they located at what is now Queenstown. Meldren bought\r\nthe farm at the head of Armstrong Run on which the noted Armstrong well\r\nwas struck in 1870. It opened “the Cross-Belt,” an abnormal strip\r\nrunning nearly at right angles to the main lines and remarkable for\r\nmammoth gushers. This unprecedented “belt” upset the theories of\r\ngeologists and operators. The first and only one of its kind, it\r\nresembled the mule that “had no pride of ancestry and no hope of\r\nposterity.” Mr. Jennings drilled on many farms and gathered a large\r\nfortune. He was a man of character and ability, with a priceless\r\nreputation for integrity and truthfulness. Once he sent his foreman,\r\nDaniel Evans, to secure the Dougherty farm, on the southern edge of\r\nPetrolia, owned by two maiden sisters. The foreman knocked at the door,\r\nengaged board for a week, was engaged to the elder sister before the\r\nweek expired and had the pleasure of reaping a harvest of greenbacks\r\nfrom the property in due course. It is satisfactory to find such\r\nenterprise abundantly recompensed. Not so lucky was a gay and festive\r\noperator with an ancient maiden who owned a tempting patch of land near\r\nMillerstown. He exhausted every art to get a lease, in desperation\r\nfinally hinting at matrimony. The indignant lady exploded like a ton of\r\ndynamite, seizing a broom and compelling the bold visitor to beat an\r\nungraceful retreat through the window, minus his hat and gloves! Evans\r\nleased part of the farm to his former employer, who finished the\r\nDougherty spouter on November twenty-second, 1873. It flowed\r\ntwenty-seven-hundred barrels a day from the fourth sand, loading\r\nJennings with greenbacks and sending the speculative trade into\r\nconvulsions. A patriotic citizen, devoted parent and genuine\r\nphilanthropist, Richard Jennings was sincerely respected and his death\r\nwas deeply mourned. His sons inherited their father’s sagacity and manly\r\nprinciple. They have operated in the McDonald field and are prominent in\r\nbanking and business at Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nThe “Cross-Belt” crossed the petroleum-horizon in dead earnest in March\r\nof 1874. Taylor & Satterfield’s Boss well, on the James Parker farm, two\r\nmiles east of Petrolia, flowed three-thousand barrels a day! William\r\nHartley—General Harrison Allen defeated him for Auditor-General in\r\n1872—organized the Stump Island Oil-Company and drilled from the mouth\r\nof the Clarion River six miles south, in 1866-7. He and John Galey owned\r\nthe Island-King well at Parker’s Landing and a hundred others, some of\r\nwhich crept well down into Armstrong county. Richard Jennings and Jacob\r\nL. Meldren had punched holes on Armstrong Run and around Queenstown, but\r\nthe spouter in the Parker-farm ravine was the fellow that touched the\r\nspot and hypnotized the trade. A solid stream of oil poured into the\r\ntank as if butted through the pipe by a hundred hydraulic-rams. The\r\nbillowy mass of fluid heaved and foamed and boiled and tried its level\r\nbest to climb over the wooden walls and unload the roof. David S.\r\nCriswell, of Oil City, had an interest in the gusher, and Criswell\r\nCity—a shop, a lunch-room and five or six dwellings—was imprinted on\r\nHeydrick & Stevenson’s map. Stages between Petrolia and Brady halted at\r\nthe bantling town for the convenience of pilgrims to the shrine of the\r\nBoss—a “boss” representing innumerable “bar’ls.” Wells were hurried down\r\nat a spanking gait, to divy up the oily freshet. “The best-laid schemes\r\no’ mice an’ men gang aft a-gley” and the uncertainty of fourth-sand\r\nwells was forcibly illustrated. Jennings had dry-holes on the Steele and\r\nBedford farms, the latter ten rods north-west of the mastodon. Taylor &\r\nSatterfield’s No. 2, thirty rods west, was a small affair. Dusters and\r\nlight pumpers studded the road from Criswell to Petrolia, with the\r\nHazelwood Oil-Company’s two-hundred-barreler a trifle north to tantalize\r\nbelievers in a straight “belt.” Lines and belts and theories and former\r\nexperiences amounted to little or nothing. The only safe method was to\r\n“go it blind” and bear with exemplary resignation whatever might turn\r\nup, be it a big gusher or a measly duster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. H. CUMMINGS.           JAHU HUNTER.]\r\n\r\nThe Boss weakened to eleven-hundred barrels in July and to a humble\r\npumper by the end of the year. Forty rods east, on the Crawford farm,\r\nHunter & Cummings plucked a September pippin. Their Lady Hunter,\r\nsixteen-hundred feet deep and flowing twenty-five-hundred barrels, was a\r\ntrophy to enrapture any hunter coming from the chase. The Boss and the\r\nLady Hunter were the lord and lady of the manor, none of the others\r\napproaching them in importance. Hunter & Cummings laid a pipe-line to\r\nEast Brady, to load their oil on the Allegheny-Valley Railroad. The\r\nrailroad company refused to furnish cars, urging a variety of pretexts\r\nto disguise the unfair discrimination. The owners of the oil had a\r\nRoland for the Oliver of the officials. They quietly gauged their output\r\nand let it run upon the ground, notifying the company to pay for the\r\noil. A new light dawned upon the railroaders, who discovered they had to\r\ndeal with men who knew their rights and dared maintain them. Crawling\r\noff their high stool, they footed the bill, apologized meekly and\r\nthenceforth took precious care Hunter & Cummings should not have reason\r\nto complain of a car-famine. Simon Legree was not the only braggart whom\r\ngood men have been obliged to knock down to inspire with decent respect\r\nfor fair-play.\r\n\r\nHunter & Cummings stayed in the business, opening the “Pontius Pool,”\r\neast of Millerstown, and sinking many wells at Herman Station, where\r\nthey acquired a snug production. They operated on the lands of the\r\nBrady’s Bend Iron-company, putting down the wells on the hills opposite\r\nEast Brady and a number in the Bradford region. They owned the Tidioute\r\nSavings Bank and large tracts in North Dakota—the scene of their\r\n“bonanza farming”—and were interested with the Grandins in the great\r\nlumber-mills at Grandin, Missouri, the largest in the south-west. In\r\nconnection with these mills they were building railroads to develop\r\ntheir two-hundred-thousand acres of timber lands and establish\r\nexperimental farms. Both members of the firm were the architects of\r\ntheir own fortunes, public-spirited, generous and eminently deserving of\r\nthe liberal measure of success that has attended their labors during the\r\ntwenty-three years of their association as partners.\r\n\r\nJahu Hunter was born on a farm two miles above Tidioute in 1830. From\r\nseventeen to twenty-seven he lumbered and farmed, in 1857 engaged in\r\nmerchandising and in 1861 sold his store and embarked in oil. He\r\noperated moderately five years, increasing his interests largely in\r\n1866 and forming a partnership with H. H. Cummings in 1873, which\r\ndeath ended. Mr. Hunter married Miss Margaret R. Magee in 1860 and one\r\nson, L. L. Hunter, survives to aid in managing his extensive\r\nbusiness-enterprises. He occupied a delightful home at Tidioute, was\r\npresident of the Savings Bank and of the chair-factory, a Mason of the\r\nthirty-second degree and a leader in all progressive movements. He had\r\nlands in various states and was prospered in manifold undertakings. He\r\nserved as school-director fifteen years, contributing time and money\r\nfreely in behalf of education. He believed in bettering humanity, in\r\nrelieving distress, in befriending the poor, in helping the struggling\r\nand in building up the community. Retired from active work, the\r\nevening of Jahu Hunter’s useful life was serene and unclouded. As the\r\nshadows lengthened he reviewed the past with calm content and awaited\r\nthe future without apprehension. He died last March.\r\n\r\nCaptain H. H. Cummings removed from Illinois, his birthplace in 1840, to\r\nOhio and was graduated from Oberlin College at twenty-two. Enlisting in\r\nJuly, 1862, he shared the privations and achievements of the Army of the\r\nCumberland until mustered out in June, 1865. Three months later he\r\nvisited the oil-region and in January of 1866 located at Tidioute in\r\ncharge of Day & Co.’s refinery. Becoming a partner, he refined and\r\nexported oil seven years and was interested in wells at Tidioute and\r\nFagundas. The firm dissolving in 1873, he joined hands with Jahu Hunter\r\nand operated extensively in the lower country. Hunter & Cummings stood\r\nin the front rank as representative producers. Captain Cummings is\r\npresident of the Missouri Mining and Lumbering Company, which has a\r\npaid-up capital of five-hundred-thousand dollars and saws forty-million\r\nfeet of lumber a year. L. L. Hunter is secretary, E. B. Grandin is\r\ntreasurer and Hon. J. B. White, formerly a member of the Legislature\r\nfrom Warren county, is general manager. As Commander of the Grand Army\r\nof the Republic in Pennsylvania, Judge Darte succeeding him this year,\r\nCaptain Cummings is favorably known to veterans over the entire state.\r\nHe is a man of fine attainments, broad views and noble traits—a man who\r\nsizes up to a high ideal, who can be trusted and whose friendship “does\r\nnot shrink in the wash.”\r\n\r\nTaylor & Satterfield began operations in the lower fields in 1870,\r\nsecured much of the finest territory in Butler and became one of the\r\nwealthiest firms in the oil-region. Harvesters rather than sowers, their\r\nusual policy was to buy lands tested by one or more wells and avoid the\r\nrisk of wildcatting. In this way they acquired productive farms in every\r\npart of the district, which yielded thousands of barrels a day when\r\nfully developed. Their transactions footed up many millions yearly. They\r\nestablished banks at Petrolia and Millerstown, employed an army of\r\ndrillers and pumpers and clerks and were always ready fora big purchase\r\nthat promised fat returns. In company with Vandergrift & Forman, John\r\nPitcairn and Fisher Brothers, they built the Fairview Pipe-Line from\r\nArgyle to Brady, the nucleus of the magnificent National-Transit system\r\nof oil-transportation. Captain J. J. Vandergrift, George V. Forman and\r\nJohn Pitcairn were associated with them in their gigantic\r\nproducing-operations, which in 1879 extended to the Bradford field and\r\ngrew to such magnitude that the Union Oil-Company was formed in 1881,\r\nwith five-millions capital. The Union was almost uniformly successful,\r\nowning big wells and paying big dividends. In 1883 it paid Forman a\r\nmillion dollars for his separate holdings in Allegany county, up to that\r\ndate the largest individual sale in the region. All its properties were\r\nsold to the Forest Oil-Company and the Union was dissolved, Taylor\r\nretiring and Satterfield continuing to assist in the management some\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nHascal L. Taylor was first known in Oildom as a member of the firm of\r\nTaylor & Day, Fredonia, N. Y., whose “buckboards” had a tremendous sale\r\nin Venango, Clarion, Armstrong and Butler. He lived at Petrolia several\r\nyears, having charge of the office of Taylor & Satterfield and general\r\noversight of the Argyle Savings Bank. After his retirement from the\r\noil-business with an ample fortune he lived at Buffalo, speculated in\r\nreal-estate and purchased miles of Florida lands. He died last year, as\r\nhe was arranging to erect a fifteen-story office-block in Buffalo. Mr.\r\nTaylor was of medium height and stout build, energetic, resourceful and\r\nnotable in the busy world of petroleum. His only son, Emory G., clerked\r\nin the bank at Petrolia, engaged in manufacturing at Williamsport a year\r\nor two and removed to Buffalo before his father’s death. He and his\r\nsister inherited the estate.\r\n\r\nJohn Satterfield, a man of heart and brain, imposing in stature, frank\r\nin speech and square in his dealings, was a Mercer boy. He served four\r\nyears in a regiment organized at Greenville and opened a grocery at\r\nPithole in 1865, with James A. Waugh as partner. Selling the remnants of\r\nthe grocery in 1867, he superintended wells at Tarr Farm three years and\r\nwent to Parker in 1870. His work in the Butler field increased his\r\nexcellent reputation for honesty and enterprise. He married Miss Matilda\r\nMartin, of Allentown, lived four years at Millerstown, removed to\r\nTitusville and built an elegant house on Delaware avenue, Buffalo. When\r\nthe Union Oil-Company’s accounts were closed, the books balanced and the\r\nassets transferred to the Forest he engaged in banking. He was\r\nvice-president of the Third National Bank of Buffalo and president of\r\nthe Fidelity Trust Company, whose new bank-building is the boast of the\r\nBison City. George V. Forman and Thomas L. McFarland joined him in the\r\nFidelity. Mr. McFarland, formerly cashier of the bank at Petrolia and\r\nsecretary of the Union Company, is exceedingly affable, capable and\r\npopular. Failing health induced Mr. Satterfield to go on a trip designed\r\nto include France, the Mediterranean Sea and the warmer countries of the\r\neast. With his brother-in-law, Dr. T. J. Martin, he reached Paris, took\r\nseriously ill and died on April sixth, 1894, in his fifty-fourth year.\r\nBesides his wife, who was on the ocean hastening to his bedside when the\r\nend came, he left one son and one daughter. Dr. Martin cremated the\r\nbody, pursuant to the wish of the deceased, and brought the ashes home\r\nfor interment. Charitable and unostentatious, upright and active, all\r\nmen liked and trusted “Jack” Satterfield, whom old friends miss sadly\r\nand remember tenderly.\r\n\r\n  The sinless land some of his friends have enter’d long ago,\r\n  Some others stay a little while to struggle here below;\r\n  But, be the conflict short or long, life’s battle will be won\r\n  And lovingly he’ll welcome us when earthly toil is done.\r\n  Nor will our joy be less sincere—we’ll slap him on the back,\r\n  Clasp his brave hand and warmly say: “We’re glad to see you, Jack!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. J. YOUNG.]\r\n\r\nThe Forest Oil-Company, into which the Union was merged, reckons its\r\ncapital by millions, numbers its wells by thousands and is at the head\r\nof producing companies. Its operations cover five states. The company\r\nhas hundreds of wells and farms in Pennsylvania, operates extensively in\r\nOhio, is developing large interests in Kansas and seems certain to place\r\nKentucky and Tennessee high up in the petroleum-galaxy. From its\r\ninception as a Limited Company the management has been progressive and\r\nefficient. To meet the increasing demands of new sections the original\r\ncompany was closed out and the present one incorporated, with Captain\r\nVandergrift as president and W. J. Young as vice-president and general\r\nmanager. Mr. Young, who was also elected treasurer in 1890, was\r\npeculiarly fitted for his responsible duties by long experience and\r\nexecutive ability. Born and educated in Pittsburg, he entered the employ\r\nof a leather-merchant in 1856, spent six years in the establishment and\r\nin 1862 went to Oil City to take charge of the forwarding and storage\r\nbusiness of John and William Hanna. The Hannas owned the steamboat\r\nAllegheny Belle No. 4 and Hanna’s wharf, the site of the\r\nNational-Transit machine-shops in the Third Ward. Captain John Hanna\r\ndying, John Burgess & Co. bought the firm’s storage interests and\r\nadmitted Young as a partner. Burgess & Co. sold to Fisher Brothers, who\r\nused the wharf and yard for shipping and appointed Mr. Young their\r\nfinancial agent. How capably he filled the place every operator on Oil\r\nCreek can attest. He and John J. Fisher, under the name of Young & Co.,\r\nbought and shipped crude-oil in bulk-barges. His relations with the\r\nFishers ceased in 1872 with his appointment as book-keeper of the\r\nOil-City Savings Bank. Elected cashier of the Oil-City Trust Company in\r\n1874, he was afterwards vice-president and president, holding the latter\r\noffice until 1891. John Pitcairn retiring from the firm of Vandergrift,\r\nPitcairn & Co., he purchased an interest in the business. The firm of\r\nVandergrift, Young & Co. was organized and sold its property to the\r\nForest Oil-Company, of which Mr. Young was one of the incorporators and\r\nchairman. The business of the Forest necessitated his removal to\r\nPittsburg in 1889. He is president of the Washington Oil-Company and the\r\nTaylorstown Natural-Gas Company and has his offices in the Vandergrift\r\nbuilding, on Fourth avenue. During his twenty-seven years’ residence in\r\nOil City he was active in promoting the welfare of the community. In\r\n1866 he married Miss Morrow, sister-in-law and adopted daughter of\r\nCaptain Vandergrift. Two daughters, one the wife of Lieutenant P. E.\r\nPierce, West Point, N. Y., and the other a young lady residing with her\r\nparents, blessed the happy union. The hospitable home at Oil City was a\r\ndelightful center of moral and social influence. Mr. Young represented\r\nthe First Ward nine years in Common and Select Councils and was\r\nschool-director six years. He furthered every good cause and was a\r\nhelpful, honored citizen. Now at the meridian of life, his judgment\r\nmatured and his acute perceptions quickened, young in heart and earnest\r\nin spirit, a wider sphere enlarges his opportunities. Of W. J. Young,\r\ntrue and tried, faithful and competent, a loyal friend and prudent\r\ncounsellor, it can never be said: “Thou art weighed in the balance and\r\nfound wanting.”\r\n\r\nFairview, charmingly located two miles south-west of Petrolia, was on\r\none side of the greased streak. James M. Lambing’s gas-well a mile west\r\nlighted and heated the town, but vapor-fuel and pretty scenery could not\r\noffset the lack of oil and the dog-in-the-manger policy of greedy\r\nland-holders. Portly Major Adams—under the sod for years—built a\r\nspacious hotel, which William Lecky, Isaac Reineman, William Fleming and\r\nkindred spirits patronized. A mile-and-a-half east of Fairview and as\r\nfar south of Petrolia, on a branch of Bear Creek, the Cooper well\r\noriginated Karns City in June of 1872. S. D. Karns laid down\r\neight-thousand dollars for the supposed dry-hole on the McClymonds farm,\r\ndrilled forty feet and struck a hundred-barreler. Cooper Brothers\r\nfinished the second well—it flowed two-hundred barrels for months—on the\r\nSaturday preceding “the thirty-day shut-down.” Tabor & Thompson and\r\nCaptain Grace had moguls on the Riddle and Story farms. Big-hearted,\r\nopen-handed “Tommy” Thompson—a whiter man ne’er drew breath—operated\r\nprofitably in Butler and McKean and was active in the movements that\r\nmade 1872-3 memorable to oil-producers. The biggest well in the bunch\r\nwas A. J. Salisbury’s five-hundred-barrel spouter on the J. B. Campbell\r\nfarm, in January of 1873. Salisbury conducted the favorite Empire House,\r\nwhich perished in the noon-day blaze that extinguished two-thirds of\r\nKarns City in December of 1874. One day he bought a wagon-load of\r\npotatoes from a verdant native, who dumped the tubers into the cellar\r\nand was given a check for the purchase. He gazed at the check long and\r\nearnestly, finally breaking out: “Vot for you gives me dose paper?”\r\nSalisbury explained that it was payment for the murphies. “Mein Gott!”\r\nejaculated the ruralist, “you dinks me von tarn fool to take dot papers\r\nfor mein potatoes?” The proprietor strove to enlighten the farmer,\r\ntelling him to step across the street to the bank and get his money. “I\r\nsee nein monish there,” replied the innocent, looking at John Shirley’s\r\nhardware-store, part of which a bank occupied. Discussing finance with\r\nthe rustic would be useless, so “Jack” sent the hotel-clerk for the cash\r\nand counted it out in crisp documents bearing the serpentine autograph\r\nof General Spinner.\r\n\r\nVandergrift & Forman paid ninety-thousand dollars for the McCafferty\r\nfarm, a mile south-west of Karns City. Mr. Forman closed the deal, going\r\nto the house with a lawyer and a New-York draft. The honest granger, not\r\nfamiliar with bank-drafts, would not receive anything except actual\r\ngreenbacks. The parties journeyed to the county-seat to convert the\r\ndraft into legal-tenders, which the seller of the property carried home.\r\nWilliam McCafferty was a thrifty tiller of the soil and cultivated his\r\nfarm thoroughly. He bought a home at Greenville, near John\r\nBenninghoff’s, put his money in Government bonds and died in 1880. Half\r\nthe farm was fine territory and repaid its cost several times.\r\nOne-twentieth of the price in 1873 would be good value to-day for the\r\nbroad acres. For John Blaney’s farm, adjoining the McCafferty, Melville,\r\nPayne & Fleming put up fifteen-thousand dollars, bored a well and sold\r\nout to Vandergrift & Forman at fifty-thousand. The Rob Roy well, on the\r\nMcClymonds farm, produced forty-thousand barrels of fourth-sand oil,\r\nwhile a dry hole was sunk thirty yards away. Colonel Woodward, Mattison\r\n& McDonald, Tack & Moorhead and John Markham owned wells good for thirty\r\nto eight-hundred barrels. A cloud of dry-holes encompassed the May\r\nMarshall, on the Wallace farm. Haysville, on the Thomas Hays farm, had a\r\nbrief run, a harvest of small strikes and dusters nipping it off\r\nprematurely. The epitaph of the Philadelphia baby would about fit:\r\n\r\n                “Died when young and full of promise,\r\n                Our own little darling Thomas;\r\n                We can’t have things here to please us—\r\n                He has gone to dwell with Jesus.”\r\n\r\nBranching off a mile south of Karns City, on January thirty-first, 1873,\r\nthe first well—one-hundred and fifty barrels—was finished on the Moore &\r\nHepler farm of three-hundred acres. Another in February strengthened\r\n“the belt theory,” belief in which induced C. D. Angell, John L.\r\nMcKinney, Phillips Brothers and O. K. Warren to form a company and test\r\nthe tract. Their faith was recompensed “an hundred fold” by an array of\r\ndandy wells and the unfolding of Angelica. Operators were feeling their\r\nway steadfastly. Two miles south-east of Angelica, on the Simon Barnhart\r\nfarm, Messimer & Backus’s wild-cat—also a February plant—pumped eight\r\nbarrels a day. Shreve & Kingsley’s, on the Stewart farm, a mile\r\nnorth-east, found good sand and flowed one-hundred-and-forty barrels, in\r\nApril, 1873. The fickle tide turned in that direction and Millerstown, a\r\ndingy, pokey hamlet on a side-elevation in Donegal township, a half-mile\r\nsouth-east of the Shreve-spouter, was on everybody’s lips. Some persons\r\nand some communities have greatness thrust upon them and Millerstown was\r\nof this brood. The natives awakened one April morning to find their\r\nsettlement invaded by the irrepressible oilmen.\r\n\r\nFor sixty years the quiet hamlet of Barnhart’s Mills—a colony of\r\nBarnharts settled in Donegal when the nineteenth century was in its\r\nteens—stuck contentedly in the old rut, “the world unknowing, by the\r\nworld unknown.” It consisted chiefly of log-houses, looking sufficiently\r\nantiquated to have been imported in William Penn’s good ship Welcome. A\r\nchurch, a school, a blacksmith-shop, a grocery, a general store and a\r\ntavern had existed from time immemorial. A grist-mill ground wheat and\r\nthe name of Barnhart’s Mills was adopted by the post-office authorities.\r\nIt yielded to Millerstown and finally to Chicora. The two-hundred\r\nvillagers went to bed at dark and breakfasted by candle-light in winter.\r\nA birth, a marriage or a funeral aroused profound interest. At last news\r\nof oil “from Parker down” was heard occasionally. Petrolia arose and the\r\nMillerites shivered with apprehension. Was the petroleum-wave to\r\nsubmerge their peaceful homes? The Shreve well answered the query\r\naffirmatively and the invasion was not delayed. Crowds came, properties\r\nchanged hands, old houses were razed and by July the ancient borough was\r\ndisguised as a modern oil-town. Dr. Book built a grand hotel, Taylor &\r\nSatterfield established a bank, the United and Relief Pipe-Lines opened\r\noffices, the best firms were represented and “on to Millerstown” was the\r\nshibboleth of the hour. McFarland & Co.’s seventy-barrel well on the\r\nThorn farm, a mile north-east of town, the third in the district, fed\r\nthe oily flame. Dr. James, on R. Barnhart’s lands, finished the fourth,\r\nan eighty-barreler, in June, a half-mile west of the Shreve & Kingsley,\r\nwhich Clark & Timblin bought for twenty-thousand dollars. Wyatt, Fertig\r\n& Hammond’s mammoth flowed one-thousand barrels a day! Col. Wyatt was a\r\nreal Virginian, chivalric, educated and high-strung. Hon. John Fertig\r\nwas a pioneer on Oil Creek and had operated at Foxburg with John W.\r\nHammond. The Wyatt spouted for months.\r\n\r\nMcKeown & Morissey drilled rib-ticklers on the Nolan farm. Warden &\r\nFrew, F. Prentice, Taylor & Satterfield, Captain Grace, John Preston,\r\nCook & Goldsboro, Samuel P. Boyer, C. D. Angell and multitudes more\r\nscored big hits. McKinney Brothers & Galey secured the Hemphill and\r\nFrederick farms, on which they drilled scores of splendid wells. James\r\nM. Lambing had a chunk near the Wyatt, with Col. Brady next door. Lee &\r\nPlumer, fresh from their triumphs in Clarion, leased the Diviner farm,\r\ntwo miles south-west of Millerstown, for two-hundred dollars an acre\r\nbonus and one-eighth royalty. Their first well flowed fifteen-hundred\r\nbarrels and they sold to Taylor & Satterfield for ninety-thousand\r\ndollars after its production paid the bonus and the drilling. Henry\r\nGreene drilled on the Johnson farm, two miles straight south of the\r\nvillage, and P. M. Shannon’s, on the Boyle, was the lion of the eastern\r\nbelt. A dry strip divided the field into two productive lines. P. H.\r\nBurchfield opened the Gillespie farm and Joseph Overy touched the Mead,\r\nfour miles south of Millerstown, for a two-hundred-barreler that\r\ninstalled St. Joe. Dr. Hunter, of Pittsburg, monkeyed a well on the\r\nGillespie for many weeks, inaugurating the odious “mystery” racket.\r\nMillerstown was a peach of the most approved pattern, holding its own\r\nbravely until Bradford overwhelmed the southern region. A narrow-gauge\r\nrailroad connected it with Parker in 1876. Fire in 1875 swept away the\r\ncentral portion of the town and blotted out seven lives. Oil has\r\nreceded, the operators have departed and the town is once more a placid\r\ncountry village.\r\n\r\nThe Barnhart and Hemphill farms yielded McKinney Brothers a lavish\r\nreturn, the wells averaging fifty to three-hundred barrels month after\r\nmonth. The two brothers, John L. and J. C., were not amateurs in\r\noil-matters. Sons of a well-to-do lumberman and farmer in Warren county,\r\nthey learned business-methods in boyhood and were fitted by habit and\r\neducation to manage important enterprises. Their connection with\r\npetroleum dated back to the sixties, in the oldest districts. The\r\nknowledge stored up on Oil Creek and around Franklin and at\r\nPleasantville was of immense benefit in the lower fields. Organizing the\r\nfirm of McKinney Brothers in 1890, to operate at Parker, they kept pace\r\nwith the trend of developments southward. Millerstown impressed them\r\nfavorably and they paid seventy-thousand dollars for the Barnhart and\r\ntwo Hemphill farms, two-hundred-and-seventy acres in the heart of the\r\nrichest territory. John Galey purchased an interest in the properties,\r\nwhich the partners developed judiciously. J. C. McKinney and Galey\r\nresided at Millerstown to oversee the numerous details of their\r\nextensive operations. In 1877, H. L. Taylor, John Satterfield, John\r\nPitcairn and the brothers formed the partnership known as John L.\r\nMcKinney & Co. It was controlled and managed by the McKinneys, until the\r\nsale of its interests to the Standard Oil-Company. John L. and J. C.\r\nMcKinney sold their Ohio lands and wells in 1889 and their Pennsylvania\r\noil-properties in 1890, since which period they have been associated\r\nwith the Standard in one of its great producing branches, the South Penn\r\nOil-Company. Noah S. Clark is president of the South Penn, with\r\nheadquarters at Oil City and Pittsburg. This company has thousands of\r\nwells in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. The wise policy that has\r\nmade the Standard the world’s foremost corporation has nowhere been\r\nmanifested more effectively than in the formation of such companies as\r\nthe Forest and the South Penn. Letting sellers of production share in\r\nthe ownership and management of properties united in one grand system\r\nsecures the advantages of concerted action, unlimited capital, identity\r\nof interest and combined experience. Thus men of the highest skill join\r\nhands for the good of all, using the latest appliances, buying at\r\nwholesale for cash, producing oil at the smallest cost and giving the\r\npublic the fruits of systematic coöperation. In this free country “the\r\npoor man’s back-yard opens into all out-doors” and many producers, like\r\nJohn McKeown, Captain Jones “The.” Barnsdall and Michael Murphy have\r\nbeen conspicuously successful going it alone. Sometimes a growl is heard\r\nabout monopoly, centralization and the octave of similar phrases, just\r\nas folks grumble at the weather, the heat and cold and think they could\r\nrun the universe much better than its Creator does it.\r\n\r\n                  “Oh, many a wicked smile they smole,\r\n                    And many a wink they wunk;\r\n                  And, oh, it is an awful thing\r\n                    To think the thoughts they thunk.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN L. MCKINNEY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. C. MCKINNEY.]\r\n\r\nHon. John L. McKinney’s talent for business displayed itself in youth.\r\n“The boy’s the father to the man” and at sixteen he assumed charge of\r\nhis father’s accounts, superintending the sale of lumber and\r\nfarm-products three years. At nineteen, in the fall of 1861, he drilled\r\nhis first well, a dry-hole south of Franklin. Two leases on Oil Creek\r\nfared better and in the spring he purchased one-third of a drilling well\r\nand lease on the John McClintock farm, near Rouseville. The well was\r\nspring-poled three-hundred feet, horse-power put it to four-hundred and\r\nan engine to five-hundred, at which depth it flowed six-hundred barrels,\r\nlasting two years, lessening slowly and producing enough oil to enrich\r\nthe owners. Young McKinney worked his turn, “kicking the pole” all\r\nsummer and visiting his home in Warren county when steam was substituted\r\nfor human and equine muscle. During his absence the sand was prodded,\r\nthe golden stream responded and his partner sold out for a round sum,\r\ntaking no note of his share! He heard of the strike and found the\r\npurchasers in full possession upon his return. His contract had not been\r\nrecorded, one day remained to file it with the register and he saved his\r\nclaim by a few hours! He bought interests on Cherry Run that profited\r\nhim two-hundred thousand dollars, in 1864 leased large tracts in Greene\r\ncounty and in 1865 removed to Philadelphia. He operated on Benninghoff\r\nRun in 1866, the crash of 1867 swept away his gains and he began again\r\n“at the top of the ground.” With his younger brother, J. C. McKinney, he\r\ndrilled at Pleasantville in 1868 and the next year located at Parker’s\r\nLanding, operating constantly and managing an agency for the sale of\r\nGibbs & Sterrett machinery. Success crowded upon him in 1871 and in 1873\r\nMcKinney Brothers & Galey were the leaders in the Millerstown field.\r\nMrs. McKinney, a beautiful and accomplished woman, died in 1894. Mr.\r\nMcKinney built an elegant home at Titusville and he has been an\r\ninfluential citizen of “the Queen City of Oildom” for twenty years. He\r\nis president of the Commercial Bank and a heavy stockholder in local\r\nindustries. He has resisted pressing demands for his services in public\r\noffice, preferring the private station, yet participating actively in\r\npolitics. John L. McKinney is earnest and manly everywhere, steadfast in\r\nhis friendships, true to his professions, liberal and honorable always.\r\n\r\nJ. C. McKinney engaged with an engineer-corps of the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad Company in 1861, at the age of seventeen, to survey lines\r\nsouthward from Garland, on the Philadelphia & Erie Road. The survey\r\nending at Franklin in 1863, he left the corps and started a lumber-yard\r\nat Oil City. His father was a lumberman at Pittsfield, Warren county,\r\nand the youth of nineteen knew every branch of the business thoroughly.\r\nHe opened a yard at Franklin in 1864, resided there a number of years\r\nand in 1868 married Miss Agnes E. Moore. His first well, drilled at\r\nFoster in 1865, produced moderately. In company with C. D. Angell, he\r\ndrilled on Scrubgrass Island—Mr. Angell changed the name to Belle Island\r\nfor his daughter Belle—in 1866 and at Pleasantville in 1868 with his\r\nbrother, John L. Operating for heavy-oil at Franklin in 1869-70, he sold\r\nhis wells to Egbert, Mackey & Tafft and settled at Parker’s Landing in\r\n1870. The firm’s operations in Butler county requiring his personal\r\nattention, he built a house and resided at Millerstown several years.\r\nThere he worked zealously, purchasing blocks of land and drilling a\r\nlegion of prolific wells. Upon the subsidence of the Butler field he\r\nremoved to Titusville, buying and remodeling the Windsor mansion, which\r\nhe made one of the finest residences in the oil-region. He assists in\r\nmanaging the South Penn Oil-Company, to which McKinney Brothers disposed\r\nof their interests in Ohio and Pennsylvania. In the flush of healthful\r\nvigor, wealthy and respected, he enjoys “the good the gods provide.” He\r\nkeeps fast horses, handles the ribbons skillfully, can guide a big\r\nenterprise or an untamed bicycle deftly, is companionable and utterly\r\ndevoid of affectation. To the McKinneys, men of positive character and\r\nstrict integrity, the Roman eulogy applies: “A pair of noble brothers.”\r\n\r\n“Plumer’s Ride to Diviner” discounted Sheridan’s Ride to Winchester in\r\nthe estimation of Millerstown hustlers. Various operators longed and\r\nprayed for the Diviner farm of two-hundred acres, two miles south of\r\nMillerstown, which “Ed” Bennett’s three-hundred barrel well on the Boyle\r\nfarm rendered very desirable. The old, childless couple owning it\r\ndeclined to lease or sell, not wishing to move out of the old house. Lee\r\n& Plumer were on the anxious seat with the rest of the fraternity.\r\nPlumer overheard a big operator tell his foreman one morning to offer\r\nthree-hundred dollars an acre for the farm. “Fred” lost not a moment.\r\nOrdering his two-twenty horse to be saddled instantly, he galloped to\r\nthe Diviner domicile in hot haste and said: “I’ll give you two-hundred\r\ndollars an acre and one-eighth the oil for your land and let you stay in\r\nthe house!” The aged pair consulted a moment, accepted the offer and\r\nsigned an agreement to transfer the property in three days. The ink was\r\nnot dry when the foreman rode up, but “Fred” met him in the yard with a\r\nsmile that expressed the gospel-hymn: “Too late, too late, ye cannot\r\nenter in!” The first well repaid the whole outlay in thirty days, when\r\nTaylor & Satterfield paid ninety-thousand dollars for Lee & Plumer’s\r\nholdings, a snug sum to rake in from a two-mile horseback-ride. With a\r\nfine sense of appreciation the well was labeled “Plumer’s Ride to\r\nDiviner,” a board nailed to the walking-beam bearing the protracted\r\ntitle in artistic capitals.\r\n\r\nThe Millerstown fire ended seven human lives, four of them at Dr. Book’s\r\nCentral Hotel. A. G. Oliver, of Kane City, was roasted in the room\r\noccupied by me the previous night. Norah Canty, a waitress, descended\r\nthe stairs, returned for her trunk and was burned to a cinder. Nellie\r\nMcCarthy jumped from a high window to the street, fracturing both legs\r\nand sustaining injuries that crippled her permanently. In loss of life\r\nthe fire ranked next to the dreadful tragedy of the burning-well at\r\nRouseville.\r\n\r\nP. M. Shannon, first burgess of Millerstown, had a fashion of saluting\r\nintimate friends with the query: “Where are we now?” Possibly this was\r\nthe origin of the popular phrase, “Where are we at?” A zealous officer\r\narrested a drunken loafer one afternoon. The fellow struggled to get\r\nfree and the officer halted a wagon to haul the obstreperous drunk to\r\nthe lock-up. The prisoner was laid on his back in the wagon and his\r\ncaptor tried to hold him down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “WHERE ARE WE NOW?”]\r\n\r\nA crowd gathered and the burgess got aboard to assist the peeler. He was\r\nholding the feet of the law-breaker, with his back to the end-board, at\r\nthe instant the wheels struck a plank-crossing. The shock keeled Shannon\r\nbackwards over the end-board into the deep, vicious mud! The spectators\r\nthought of shedding tears at the sad plight of their chief magistrate,\r\nwho sank at full length nearly out of sight. As he raised his head a\r\nragged urchin bawled out: “Where are we now?” The laugh that ensued was\r\na risible earthquake and thenceforth the expression had unlimited\r\ncirculation in the lower districts.\r\n\r\nThe Millerstown field produced ten-thousand barrels a day at its prime\r\nand the temptation to enlarge the productive area even St. Anthony, had\r\nhe been an oil-operator, would have found it hard to resist. A half-mile\r\nwest, at the Brick Church, J. A. Irons punched a hole and started a\r\nhardware-store that hatched out Irons City. St. Joe, where two-hundred\r\nlots were sold in thirty days and a beer-jerker’s tent was the first\r\nbusiness-stand, was the outcome of good wells on the Now, Meade, Boyd,\r\nNeff and Graham farms, four miles south. Three miles farther dry-holes\r\nblasted the budding hopes of Jeffersonville. Three miles south-west of\r\nMillerstown, on an elevated site, Buena Vista bade fair to knock the\r\npersimmons. The territory exhausted too speedily for comfort, other\r\npoints lured the floaters, hotels and stores stood empty and a fire sent\r\nthree-fourths of the neat little town up in smoke. Two miles west the\r\nHope Oil-Company’s Troutman well, reported on March twenty-second, 1873,\r\n“the biggest strike since ’sixty-five,” flowed twelve-hundred barrels.\r\nThe tools hung in the hole seven months, by which time the well had\r\nproduced ninety-six-thousand barrels. The gusher was on the Troutman\r\nfarm, a patch of rocks and stunted trees tenanted by a Frenchman. I. E.\r\nDean, Lecky & Reineman, Captain Grace, Captain Boyer, the Reno\r\nOil-Company and others jostled neck and neck in the race to drain the\r\nRalston, Harper, Starr, Jenkins and Troutman lands. The result was a\r\nseries of spouters that aggregated nine-thousand barrels a day. Phillips\r\nBrothers paid eighty-thousand dollars for the Starr farm and trebled\r\ntheir money in a year. William K. Vandergrift’s Blackhawk was a\r\nfive-hundred barreler and dozens more swelled the production and the\r\nexcitement. The day before Husselton & Thompson’s seven-hundred\r\nbarreler, on the Gruber farm, struck the sand the boiler exploded. Two\r\nmen were standing on a tank discussing politics. They saw a ton of iron\r\nheading directly towards them, concluded to postpone the argument and\r\nleaped from the tank as the flying mass tore off half the roof. The\r\nRalston farm evoluted the embryo town of Batesville, named for the late\r\nJoseph Bates, of Oil City, and Modoc planted its wigwams on the Starr\r\nand Sutton.\r\n\r\nModoc stood at the top of the class for mud. The man who found a\r\ngold-dollar in a can of tomatoes and denounced the grocer for selling\r\nadulterated goods would have had no reason to grumble at the mud around\r\nModoc. It was pure, unmixed and unstinted. The voyager who, in the\r\nspring or fall of 1873, accomplished the trip from Troutman to the\r\nfrontier wells without exhausting his stock of profanity earned a\r\nfree-pass to the happy hunting-grounds. Twenty balloon-structures were\r\nerected by May first and a red-headed dispenser of stimulants answered\r\nto the title of “Captain Jack.” Modoc was not a Tammany offshoot, but\r\nthe government had an Indian war on hand and red-skinned epithets\r\nprevailed. The town soon boasted three stores, four hotels, liveries and\r\nfive-hundred people. By and by the spouters wilted badly, degenerating\r\ninto pumpers. On a cold, rainy night in the autumn of 1874 fire started\r\nin Max Elasser’s clothing-store and one-half the town was absent at dawn\r\nnext morning. Biting wind and drenching showers added to the sadness of\r\nthe dismal scene. Women and children, weeping and homeless, crouched in\r\nthe fields until daylight and shelter arrived. That was the last chapter\r\nin the history of Modoc. The American Hotel and a few houses escaped the\r\nflames, but the destroyed buildings were not replaced. It would puzzle a\r\ntourist now to find an atom of Modoc or the wells that vegetated about\r\nthe Troutman whale.\r\n\r\nTwo miles south of Modoc the McClelland farm made a bold effort to\r\noutshine the Troutman. Phillips Brothers owned the biggest wells,\r\nluscious fellows that salt-water killed off prematurely. They paid\r\nforty-five-thousand dollars for the Stahl & Benedict No. 1 well. The\r\nfarmer leased the tract to George Nesbit and John Preston. Nesbit placed\r\ntimbers for a rig on the ground and entrenched a force of men behind a\r\nfence. Preston’s troops scaled the fence, dislodged the enemy, carried\r\nthe timbers off the premises, built a rig and drilled a well. Such\r\ndisputes were liable to occur from the ignorance or knavery of the\r\nnatives, some of whom leased the same land to several parties. In one of\r\nthese struggles for possession Obadiah Haymaker was shot dead at\r\nMurraysville, near Pittsburg. Milton Weston, a Chicago millionaire, who\r\nhired and armed the attacking party, was sent to the penitentiary for\r\nmanslaughter. Haymaker was pleasant, sociable and worthy of a better\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nDavid Morrison leased ten acres of the Jamison farm, three miles below\r\nModoc and seven south of Petrolia, at one-fiftieth royalty. The\r\nproperty was situated on Connoquinessing Creek, a tributary of Beaver\r\nRiver, in the bosom of a rugged country. On August twenty-fourth,\r\n1872, the tools pricked the sand, gas burst forth and oil flowed\r\nfuriously. The gas sought the boiler-fire and the entire concern was\r\nspeedily in a blaze. Unlike many others in the oil-region, the\r\nMorrison well suffered no injury from the fire. It flowed\r\nthree-hundred barrels a day for a month and in October was sold to\r\nTaylor & Satterfield for thirty-eight-thousand dollars. They cleaned\r\nout the hole, which mud had clogged, restoring the yield to\r\ntwo-hundred barrels. S. D. Karns completed the Dogleg well, the second\r\nin the field, on Christmas day, and the third early in January, the\r\ntwo wells flowing seven-hundred barrels. John Preston’s No. 1, a\r\nhalf-mile northward, flowed two-hundred barrels on January twelfth.\r\nPreston was a strong-limbed, black-haired, courageous operator, who\r\ncut his eye-teeth in the upper fields. He augmented his pile at\r\nParker, Millerstown and Greece City, landing at last in Washington\r\ncounty. He was not averse to a hand at cards or a gamble in\r\nproduction. His word was never broken and he vied with John McKeown\r\nand John Galey in untiring energy. A truer, livelier, braver lot of\r\nmen than the Butler oil-operators never stepped on God’s green carpet.\r\nA mean tyrant might as well try to climb into heaven on a greased pole\r\nas to keep them at the bottom of the heap.\r\n\r\nThe first new building on the Jamison farm, a frame drug-store, was\r\nerected on September tenth. Eight-hundred people inhabited Greece City\r\nby the end of December. Drinking dens drove a thriving trade and three\r\nhotels could not stow away the crowds. J. H. Collins fed five-hundred a\r\nday. Theodore Huselton established a bank and Rev. Mr. Thorne a\r\nnewspaper. A post-office was opened at New-Year. Two pipe-lines conveyed\r\noil to Butler and Brady, two telegraph-offices rushed messages, a church\r\nblossomed in the spring and a branch of the West Penn Railroad was\r\nproposed. Greece City combined the muddiness and activity of Shaffer and\r\nFunkville with the ambition of Reno. Fifty wells were drilling in\r\nFebruary and the surrounding farms were not permitted to “linger longer,\r\nLucy,” than was necessary to haul machinery and set the walking-beam\r\nsawing the atmosphere. Joseph Post—a jolly Rousevillean, who weighed\r\ntwo-hundred pounds, operated at Bradford and retired to a farm in\r\nOhio—tested the Whitmire farm, two miles south. An extensive water-well\r\nwas the best the farm had to offer and Boydstown, built in expectation\r\nof the oil that never came, scampered off. The third sand was only\r\ntwelve to fifteen feet thick and the wells declined with unprecedented\r\nsuddenness. The bottom seemed to drop out of the territory in a\r\ntwinkling. The town wilted like a paper-collar in the dog-days. Houses\r\nwere torn down or deserted and rigs carted to Millerstown. In December\r\nfire licked up three-fourths of what removals had spared, summarily\r\nending Greece City at the fragile age of thirteen months. “The isles of\r\nGreece, were burning Sappho loved and sung,” may have been pretty slick,\r\nbut the oil of Greece City would have burned out Sappho in one round.\r\n\r\n“The meanest man I ever saw,” a Butler judge remarked to a company of\r\nfriends at Collins’s Hotel, “has never appeared in my court as a\r\ndefendant and it is lucky for him. As a matter of course he was a\r\nnewspaper man—a rascal of a reporter for the Greece City _Review_,\r\nprinted right in this town, and there he stands! One day he was playing\r\nseven-up with a young lady and guess what he did? He told her that\r\nwhenever she had the jack of trumps it was a sure sign her lover was\r\nthinking of her. Then he watched her and whenever she blushed and looked\r\npleased he would lead a high card and catch her jack. A man who would do\r\nthat would steal a hot stove or write a libellous joke about me.” The\r\njudge was a rare joker and the young man whom he apostrophised for fun\r\ndidn’t know a jack from a load of hay.\r\n\r\nParker, Martinsburg, Argyle, Petrolia, the “Cross Belt,” Karns City,\r\nAngelica, Millerstown, St. Joe, Buena Vista, Modoc and Greece City had\r\npassed in review. The “belt” extended fifteen miles and the Butler field\r\nacknowledged no rival. The great Bradford district was about to distance\r\nall competitors and leave the southern region hopelessly behind, yet\r\noperators did not desist from their efforts to discover an outlet below\r\nGreece City and St. Joe. Two miles west of the county-seat Phillips\r\nBrothers stumbled upon the Baldridge pool, which produced largely. The\r\nold town of Butler, settled at the beginning of the century and not\r\nremarkable for enterprise until the oilmen shoved it forward, was dry\r\nterritory. Eastward pools of minor note were revealed. William K.\r\nVandergrift, whose three-hundred-barrel well on the Pontius farm ushered\r\nin Buena Vista’s short-lived reign, drilled at Saxonburg. Along the\r\nWest-Penn Railroad fair wells encouraged the quest. David Kirk entered\r\nGreat Belt City in the race and the country was punctured like a\r\nbicycle-tire tripping over a road strewn with tacks pointing skyward and\r\nloaded for mischief. South of St. Joe gas blew off and Spang & Chalfant\r\nlaid a line from above Freeport to pipe the stuff into their\r\nrolling-mills at Pittsburg. The search proceeded without big surprises,\r\nBradford monopolizing public interest and Butler jogging on quietly at\r\nthe rear. But the old field had plenty of ginger and was merely\r\nrecovering some of the breath expended in producing forty-million\r\nbarrels of crude. “I smell a rat,” felicitously observed Sir Boyle\r\nRoche, “and see him floating in the air.” The free play of the drill\r\ncould hardly fail to ferret out something with the smell of petroleum in\r\nthe soap-mine county, beyond the cut-off at Greece City and Baldridge.\r\nBradford was sliding down the mountain it had ascended and Butler\r\nfurnished the answer to the conundrum of where to look for the next\r\nfertile spot.\r\n\r\nCol. S. P. Armstrong, who experienced a siege of hard luck in the upper\r\nlatitudes, in 1884 leased a portion of the Marshall farm, on Thorn\r\nCreek, six miles south-west of the town of Butler. Operators had been\r\nskirmishing around the southern rim of the basin, looking for an annex\r\nto the Baldridge pool. Andrew Shidemantle was drilling near the mouth of\r\nthe creek, on the north bank of which Johnson & Co.’s well, finished in\r\nMay, found plenty of sand and salt-water and a taste of oil. More than\r\nonce Armstrong was pressed for funds to pay the workmen drilling the\r\nwell he began on the little stream and he sold an interest to Boyd &\r\nSemple. A vein of oil was met on June twenty-seventh, gas ignited the\r\nrig and for a week the well burned fiercely. The flames were subdued\r\nfinally, the well pumped and flowed one-hundred-and-fifty barrels a day\r\nand No. 2 was started fifty rods north-east. Meanwhile Phillips Brothers\r\nset the tools dancing on the Bartlett farm, adjoining the Marshall on\r\nthe north. They hit the sand on August twenty-ninth and the well flowed\r\nfive-hundred barrels next day. Drilling ten feet deeper jagged a\r\nveritable reservoir of petroleum, the well flowing forty-two-hundred\r\nbarrels on September fifteenth! At last Phillips & Vanausdall’s spouter\r\non Oil Creek had been eclipsed. The trade was “shaken clear out of its\r\nboots.” Glowing promises of a healthy advance in prices were\r\nfrost-bitten. Scouts had been hovering around and their reckoning was\r\nutterly at fault. Brokers knew not which way to turn. Crude staggered\r\ninto the ditch and speculators on the wrong side of the market went down\r\nlike the Louisiana Tigers at Gettysburg. The bull-element thought the\r\ngeyser “a scratch,” quite sure not to be duplicated, and all hands\r\nawaited impatiently the completion of Hezekiah Christie’s venture on a\r\ntwenty-five acre plot hugging the Phillips lease. The one redeeming\r\nfeature of the situation was that nobody had the temerity to remark, “I\r\ntold you so!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TELEGRAPH-OFFICE IN CARRIAGE, GROUP OF SCOUTS AND\r\nPHILLIPS WELL, THORN CREEK.]\r\n\r\nA telegraph office was rigged up near the Phillips well in an abandoned\r\ncarriage, one-third mile from the Christie. About it the sharp-eyed\r\nscouts thronged night and day. On October eleventh the Christie was\r\nknown to be nearing the critical point. Excitement was at fever-heat\r\namong the group of anxious watchers. In the afternoon some knowing-one\r\nreported that the tools were twenty-seven feet in the sand, with no show\r\nof oil. The scouts went to condole with Christie, who was sitting in the\r\nboiler-house, over his supposed dry-hole. One elderly scout, whose\r\nrotundity made him “the observed of all observers,” was especially warm\r\nin his expressions of sympathy. “That’s all right, Ben,” said Christie,\r\n“but before night you’ll be making for the telegraph-office to sell your\r\noil at a gait that will make a euchre-game on your coat-tails an easy\r\nmatter.” When the scout had gone he walked into the derrick and asked\r\nhis driller how far he was in the sand. “Only twenty-two feet and we are\r\nsure to strike oil before three o’clock. Those scouts don’t know what\r\nthey’re talking about.” Christie went back to the boiler-house and\r\nwaited. It was an interesting scene. About the old buggy were the\r\nself-confident scouts, many of whom had already wired their principals\r\nthat the well was dry. The intervals between the strokes of the drill\r\nappeared to be hours. At length the well began to gas. Then came a low,\r\nrumbling sound and those about the carriage saw a cloud-burst of oil\r\nenvelop the derrick. The Christie well was in and the biggest gusher the\r\noil-country had ever known! The first day it did over five-thousand\r\nbarrels, seven-thousand for several days after torpedoing, and for a\r\nmonth poured out a sea of oil. Christie refused one-hundred-thousand\r\ndollars for his monster, which cast the Cherry Grove gushers completely\r\ninto the shade. Phillips No. 3, four-hundred barrels, Conners No. 1,\r\nthirty-seven-hundred, and Phillips No. 2, twenty-five hundred, were\r\nadded to the string on October eighteenth, nineteenth and twenty-first.\r\nCrude tumbled, the bears pranced wildly and everybody wondered if Thorn\r\nCreek had further surprises up its sleeve. Bret Harte’s “heathen Chinee”\r\nwith five aces was less of an enigma.\r\n\r\nAll this time Colonel Armstrong, who borrowed money to build his first\r\nderrick and buy his first boiler, was pegging away at his second well.\r\nThe sand was bored through into the slate beneath and the contractor\r\npronounced the well a failure. The scouts agreed with him unanimously\r\nand declared the contractor a level-headed gentleman. The owner, who\r\nlooked for something nicer than salt-water and forty-five feet of\r\nungreased sand, did not lose every vestige of hope. He decided to try\r\nthe persuasive powers of a torpedo. At noon on October twenty-seventh\r\nsixty quarts of nitro-glycerine were lowered into the hole. The usual\r\nlow rumbling responded, but the expected flow did not follow\r\nimmediately. One of the scouts laughingly offered Armstrong a cigar for\r\nthe well, which the whole party declared “no good.” They broke for the\r\ntelegraph-office in the buggy to wire that the well was a duster. Prices\r\nstiffened and the bulls breathed more freely.\r\n\r\nThe scouts changed their minds and their messages very speedily. The\r\nrumbling increased until its roar resembled a small Niagara. A sheet of\r\nsalt-water shot out of the hole over the derrick, followed by a shower\r\nof slate, stones and dirt. A moment later, with a preliminary cough to\r\nclear its passage, the oil came with a mighty rush. A giant stream\r\nspurted sixty feet above the tall derrick, dug drains in the ground and\r\nsaturated everything within a radius of five-hundred feet! The Jumbo of\r\noil-wells had been struck. Thousands of barrels of oil were wasted\r\nbefore the cap could be adjusted on the casing. Tanks had been provided\r\nand a half-dozen pipes were needed to carry the enormous mass of fluid.\r\nIt was an inspiring sight to stand on top of the tank and watch the\r\ntossing, heaving, foaming deluge. The first twenty-four hours Armstrong\r\nNo. 2 flowed _eight-thousand-eight-hundred barrels_! It dropped to\r\nsix-thousand by November first, to six-hundred by December first and\r\nnext morning stopped altogether, having produced eighty-nine-thousand\r\nbarrels in thirty-seven days! Armstrong then divided his lease into\r\nfive-acre patches, sold them at fifteen-hundred dollars bonus and half\r\nthe oil and quit Thorn Creek in the spring a half-million ahead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MILLER & YEAGLE FLOWING INTO TANK\r\n         ARMSTRONG FLOWING INTO TANK\r\n                       ARMSTRONG WELL\r\n]\r\n\r\nFisher Brothers were the largest operators in the field. From the\r\nMarshall farm of three-hundred acres—worth ten dollars an acre for\r\nfarming—they took four-hundred-thousand dollars’ worth of oil. Their\r\nbiggest well flowed forty-two-hundred barrels on November fifteenth,\r\nwhen the total output of the field was sixteen-thousand, its highest\r\nnotch. Miller & Yeagle’s spouter put forty-five-hundred into the tank,\r\nsending out a stream that filled a five-inch pipe. Thomas B. Simpson, of\r\nOil City, joined with Thomas W. Phillips in leasing the Kennedy farm and\r\ndrilling a three-thousand-barrel well. They sold to the Associated\r\nProducers in December for eighty-thousand dollars and Simpson, a\r\nsensible man every day in the year, presented his wife with a Christmas\r\ncheck for his half of the money. McBride and Campbell, two young\r\ndrillers who had gone to Thorn Creek in search of work, went a mile in\r\nadvance of developments and bored a well that did five-thousand barrels\r\na day. They sold out to the Associated Producers for ninety-thousand and\r\nsix months later their big well was classed among the small pumpers.\r\nCampbell saved what he had made, but success did not sit well on\r\nMcBride’s shoulders. After lighting his cigars awhile with five-dollar\r\nbills he touched bottom and went back to the drill. Hell’s Half Acre, a\r\ncrumb of land owned by the Bredin heirs, emptied sixty-thousand barrels\r\ninto the tanks of the Associated Producers. The little truck-farm of\r\nJohn Mangel put ninety-thousand into its owner’s pocket, although a\r\nlosing venture to the operators, producing barely a hundred-thousand\r\nbarrels. For the half-acre on which the red school-house was built, ten\r\nrods from the first Phillips well, the directors were offered\r\nfifty-thousand dollars. This would have endowed every school in the\r\ntownship, but legal obstacles prevented the sale and the district was\r\nthe loser. By May the production declined to seven-thousand barrels and\r\nto one-thousand by the end of 1885. The sudden rise of the field made a\r\nscore of fortunes and its sudden collapse ruined as many more. Thorn\r\nCreek, like reform measures in the Legislature, had a brilliant opening\r\nand an inglorious close.\r\n\r\nThe Thorn-Creek white-sanders encouraged wildcatting to an extraordinary\r\ndegree. In hope of extending the pool or disclosing a fresh one, “men\r\ndrilled who never drilled before, and those who always drilled but\r\ndrilled the more.” Johnson & Co., Campbell & McBride, Fisher Brothers\r\nand Shidemantle’s dusters on the southern end of the gusher-farms\r\ncondemned the territory in that direction. Painter Brothers developed a\r\nsmall pool at Riebold Station. Craig & Cappeau, who struck the initial\r\nspouter at Kane, and the Fisher Oil-Company failed to open up a field in\r\nMiddlesex township. Some oil was found at Zelienople and gas at numerous\r\npoints in raking over Butler county. The country south-west of Butler,\r\ninto West Virginia and Ohio, was overrun by oil-prospectors, intent upon\r\ntying up lands and seeing that no lurking puddle of petroleum should\r\nescape. Test wells crossed the lines into Allegheny and Beaver counties\r\nand Shoustown, Shannopin, Mt. Nebo, Coraopolis, Undercliff and Economy\r\nfigured in the newspapers as oil-centers of more or less consequence.\r\nMembers of the old guard, fortified with a stack of blues at their elbow\r\nto meet any contingency, shared in these proceedings. Brundred & Marston\r\ndrilled on Pine Creek, at the lower end of Armstrong county, in the\r\nseventies, a Pittsburg company repeating the dose in 1886. At New\r\nBethlehem they bored two-thousand feet, finding seven-hundred feet of\r\nred-rock. This rock varies from one to three-hundred feet on Oil Creek\r\nand geologists assert is six-thousand feet thick at Harrisburg,\r\ndiminishing as it approaches the Alleghenies. The late W. J. Brundred,\r\nagent at Oil City of the Empire Line until its absorption by the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, was a skilled oil-operator, practical in his\r\nideas and prompt in his methods. His son, B. F. Brundred, is president\r\nof the Imperial Refining Company and a prosperous resident of Oil City.\r\nJoseph H. Marston died in California, whither he had gone hoping to\r\nimprove his health, in 1880. He was an artist at Franklin in the opening\r\nyears of developments and removed to Oil City. He owned the Petroleum\r\nHouse and was exceptionally genial, enterprising and popular.\r\n\r\n                      “Through many a year\r\n              We shall remember, with a sad delight,\r\n              The friends forever gone from mortal sight.”\r\n\r\nPittsburg assumed the airs of a petroleum-metropolis. Natural-gas in the\r\nsuburbs and east of the city changed its sooty blackness to a delicate\r\nclearness that enabled people to see the sky. Oilmen made it their\r\nheadquarters and built houses at East Liberty and Allegheny. To-day more\r\nrepresentative producers can be seen in Pittsburg than in Oil City,\r\nTitusville or Bradford. Within a hundred yards of the National-Transit\r\noffices one can find Captain Vandergrift, T. J. Vandergrift, J. M.\r\nGuffey, John Galey, Frank Queen, W. J. Young, P. M. Shannon, Frederick\r\nHayes, Dr. M C. Egbert, A. J. Gartland, Edward Jennings, Captain Grace,\r\nS. D. Karns, William Fleming, C. D. Greenlee, John N. Lambing, John\r\nGalloway, John J. Fisher, Henry Fisher, Frederick Fisher, J. A.\r\nBuchanan, J. N. Pew, Michael Murphy, James Patterson and other veterans\r\nin the business. These are some of the men who had the grit to open new\r\nfields, to risk their cash in pioneer-experiments, to cheapen\r\ntransportation and to make kerosene “the poor man’s light.” They are not\r\nyoungsters any more, but their hearts have not grown old, their heads\r\nhave not swelled and the microbe of selfishness has not soured their\r\nkindly impulses. They are of the royal stamp that would rather tramp the\r\ncross-ties with honor than ride in a sixteen-wheeled Pullman\r\ndishonestly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. E. GRIFFITH.]\r\n\r\nGas east and oil west was the rule at Pittsburg. Wildwood was the chief\r\nsensation in 1889-90. This was the pet of W. E. Griffith, whose first\r\nwell on the Whitesell farm, twelve miles above Pittsburg, tapped the\r\nsand in March of 1890, and flowed three-hundred barrels a day. This\r\nprime send-off inaugurated Wildwood in good style. The Bear-Creek\r\nRefining-Company drilled on the C. J. Gibson farm, Pine Creek, in 1888,\r\nfinding considerable gas. Later Barney Forst and Max Klein found third\r\nsand and no oil in a well two-thirds of a mile west, on the Moon farm.\r\nJohn M. Patterson went two miles south-east and drilled the Cockscomb\r\nwell, twin-link to a duster. J. M. Guffey & Co. hit sand and a taste of\r\noil near Perrysville, between which and the Cockscomb venture Gibson &\r\nGiles had encouraging indications. Anon Griffith’s spouter touched the\r\njugular and opened a prolific pool. His No. 2 produced a quarter-million\r\nbarrels. Guffey & Co.’s No. 4, Rolsehouse farm, and Bamsdall’s No. 2,\r\nKress farm, started at three-thousand apiece the first twenty-four\r\nhours. About three-hundred acres of rich territory were punctured, some\r\nof the wells piercing the fifth sand at two-thousand feet. By the end of\r\n1890 the district had yielded thirteen-hundred-thousand barrels, placing\r\nit close to the top of the white-sand column. Wildwood is situated in\r\nAllegheny county, on the Pittsburg & Western Railroad, and W. E.\r\nGriffith is justly deemed the father of the nobby district. He is a\r\npractical man, admirably posted regarding sands and oils and in every\r\nrespect worthy of the success that has crowned his efforts to hold up\r\nhis end of the string.\r\n\r\nThirty-three wells at Wildwood realized Greenlee & Forst not far from a\r\nquarter-million dollars. Five in “the hundred-foot” field west of Butler\r\nrepaid their cost and brought them fifty-thousand dollars from the\r\nSouth-Penn Oil-Company. The two lucky operators next leased and\r\npurchased eight-hundred acres at Oakdale, Noblestown and McDonald, in\r\nAllegheny and Washington counties, fifteen to twenty miles west of\r\nPittsburg. The Crofton third-sand pool was opened in February of 1888,\r\nthe Groveton & Young hundred-foot in the winter of 1889-90 and the\r\nChartiers third-sand field in the spring of 1890. South-west of these,\r\non the J. J. McCurdy farm, five miles north-east of Oakdale, Patterson &\r\nJones drilled into the fifth sand on October seventeenth, 1890. The well\r\nflowed nine-hundred barrels a day for four months, six months later\r\naveraged two-hundred and by the end of 1891 had yielded a\r\nhundred-and-fifty thousand. Others on the same and adjacent tracts\r\nstarted at fifty to twenty-five-hundred barrels, Patterson & Jones alone\r\nderiving four-thousand barrels a day from thirteen wells. In the summer\r\nof 1890 the Royal Gas-Company drilled two wells on the McDonald estate,\r\ntwo miles west of McDonald Station and ten south-west of McCurdy,\r\nfinding a show of oil in the so-called “Gordon sand.” On the farm of\r\nEdward McDonald, west side of the borough, the company struck oil and\r\ngas in the same rock the latter part of September. The well stood idle\r\ntwo months, was bored through the fifth sand in November, torpedoed on\r\nDecember twentieth and filled three tanks of oil in ten days. The tools\r\nwere run down to clean it out, stuck fast and the pioneer venture of the\r\nMcDonald region ended its career simultaneously with the ending of 1890.\r\nThorn Creek had been a wonder and Wildwood a dandy, yet both combined\r\nwere to be dwarfed and all records smashed by the greatest white-sand\r\npool and the biggest gushers in America.\r\n\r\nGeologists solemnly averred in 1883 that “the general boundaries of the\r\noil-region of Pennsylvania are now well established,” “we can have no\r\nreasonable expectation that any new and extensive field will be found”\r\nand “there are not any grounds for anticipating the discovery of new\r\nfields which will add enough to the declining products of the old to\r\nenable the output to keep pace with the consumption.” Notwithstanding\r\nthese learned opinions, Thorn Creek had the effrontery to “be found” in\r\n1884, Wildwood in 1890 and the monarch of the tribe in 1891. The men who\r\nwant people to discard Genesis for their interpretation of the rocks\r\nwere as wide of the mark as the dudish Nimrod who couldn’t hit a\r\nbarn-door at thirty yards. He paralyzed his friends by announcing: “Wal,\r\nI hit the bullseye to-day the vehwy fiwst shot!” Congratulations were\r\npouring in when he added: “Yaas, and the bweastly fawmeh made me pay\r\ntwenty-five dollahs fawh the bull I didn’t see when I fiwed,\r\ndoncherknow!” A raw recruit instructed the architect of his uniform to\r\nsew in an iron-plate “to protect the most vital part.” The facetious\r\ntailor, instead of fixing the plate in the breast of the coat, planted\r\nit in the seat of the young fellow’s breeches. The enemy worsting his\r\nside in a skirmish, the retreating youth tried to climb over a\r\nstone-wall. A soldier rushed to transfix him with his bayonet, which\r\nlanded on the iron-plate with the force of a battering-ram. The shock\r\nhurled the climber safely into the field, tilted his assailant backward\r\nand broke off the point of the cold steel! The happy hero picked himself\r\nup and exclaimed fervently: “That tailor knew a devilish sight better’n\r\nme what’s my most vital part!” Operators who paid no heed to scientific\r\ndisquisitions, but went on opening new fields each season, believed the\r\ndrill was the one infallible test of petroleum’s most vital part.\r\n\r\nIn May of 1891 the Royal Gas-Company finished two wells on the Robb and\r\nSauters tracts, south of town, across the railroad-track. The Robb\r\nproved a twenty-barreler and the Sauters flowed one-hundred-and-sixty\r\nbarrels a day from the fifth sand. They attracted the notice of the\r\noilmen, who had not taken much stock in the existence of paying\r\nterritory at McDonald. Three miles north-east the Matthews well, also a\r\nMay-flower, produced thirty barrels a day from the Gordon rock. On July\r\nfirst it was drilled into the fifth sand, increasing the output to\r\neight-hundred barrels a day for two months. Further probing the first\r\nweek in September increased it to _eleven-thousand barrels_! Scouts\r\ngauged it at seven-hundred barrels an hour for three hours after the\r\nagitation ceased! It yielded four-hundred-thousand barrels of oil in\r\nfour months and was properly styled Matthews the Great. The owners were\r\nJames M. Guffey, John Galey, Edward Jennings and Michael Murphy. They\r\nbuilt acres of tanks and kept ten or a dozen sets of tools constantly at\r\nwork. Mr. Guffey, a prime mover in every field from Richburg to West\r\nVirginia, was largely interested in the Oakdale Oil-Company’s\r\neighteen-hundred acres. With Galey, Jennings and Murphy he owned the\r\nSturgeon, Bell and Herron farms, the first six wells on which yielded\r\ntwenty-eight-thousand barrels a day! The mastodon oil-field of the world\r\nhad been ushered in by men whose sagacious boldness and good judgment\r\nBradford, Warren, Venango, Clarion and Butler had witnessed repeatedly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  C. D. GREENLEE.           B. FORST.\r\n  GREENLEE & FORST WELL, McDONALD.\r\n]\r\n\r\nC. D. Greenlee and Barney Forst, who joined forces west of Butler and at\r\nWildwood, in August of 1891 leased James Mevey’s two-hundred-and-fifty\r\nacres, a short distance north-east of McDonald. Greenlee and John W.\r\nWeeks, a surveyor who had mapped out the district and predicted it would\r\nbe the “richest field in Pennsylvania,” selected a gentle slope beside a\r\nlight growth of timber for the first well on the Mevey farm. The rig was\r\nhurried up and the tools were hurried down. On Saturday, September\r\ntwenty-sixth, the fifth sand was cracked and oil gushed at the rate of\r\none-hundred-and-forty barrels an hour. The well was stirred a trifle on\r\nMonday, September twenty-eighth, with startling effect. It put\r\n_fifteen-thousand-six-hundred barrels_ of oil into the tanks in\r\ntwenty-four hours! The Armstrong and the Matthews had to surrender their\r\nlaurels, for Greenlee & Forst owned the largest oil-well ever struck on\r\nthis continent. On Sunday, October fourth, after slight agitation by the\r\ntools, the mammoth poured out seven-hundred-and-fifty-barrels an hour\r\nfor four hours, a record that may, perhaps, stand until Gabriel’s horn\r\nproclaims the wind-up of oil-geysers and all terrestrial things. The\r\nwell has yielded several-hundred-thousand barrels and is still pumping\r\nfifty. Greenlee & Forst’s production for a time exceeded twenty-thousand\r\nbarrels a day and they could have taken two or three-million dollars for\r\ntheir properties. The partners did not pile on the agony because of\r\ntheir good-luck. They kept their office at Pittsburg and Greenlee\r\ncontinued to live at Butler. He is a typical manager in the field,\r\nbubbling over with push and vim. Forst had a clothing-store at\r\nMillerstown in its busy days, waltzed around the bull-ring in the\r\nBradford oil-exchange and returned southward to scoop the capital prize\r\nin the petroleum-lottery.\r\n\r\nScurrying for territory in the Jumbo-field set in with the vigor of a\r\nthousand football-rushes. McDonald tourists, eager to view the wondrous\r\nspouters and hungry for any morsel of land that could be picked up,\r\npacked the Panhandle trains. Rigs were reared on town-lots, in gardens\r\nand yards. Gaslights glared, streams of oil flowed and the liveliest\r\nscenes of Oil Creek were revived and emphasized. By November first\r\ntwo-hundred wells were drilling and sixty rigs building. Fifty-four\r\nOctober strikes swelled the daily production at the close of the month\r\nto eighty-thousand barrels! What Bradford had taken years to accomplish\r\nMcDonald achieved in ninety days! Greenlee & Forst had thirty wells\r\ndrilling and three-hundred-thousand barrels of iron-tankage. Guffey,\r\nGaley & Jennings were on deck with fifteen or twenty. The Fisher\r\nOil-Company, owning one-fourth the Oakdale’s big tract and the McMichael\r\nfarm, had sixteen wells reaching for the jugular, from which the\r\nSturgeon and Baldwin spouters were drawing ten-thousand barrels a day.\r\nWilliam Guckert—he started at Foster and was active at Edenburg, Parker,\r\nMillerstown, Bradford and Thorn Creek—and John A. Steele had two\r\nproducing largely and eight going down on the Mevey farm. J. G.\r\nHaymaker, a pioneer from Allegany county, N. Y., to Allegheny county,\r\nPa., and Thomas Leggett owned one gusher, nine drilling wells and\r\nfive-hundred acres of leases. Haymaker began at Pithole, drilled in\r\nVenango and Clarion, was prominent in Butler and in 1878 optioned blocks\r\nof land on Meek’s Creek that developed good territory and the thriving\r\ntown of Haymaker, the forerunner of the Allegheny field. He boosted\r\nSaxonburg and Legionville and his brother, Obadiah Haymaker, opened the\r\nMurraysville gas-field and was shot dead defending his property against\r\nan attack by Weston’s minions. Veterans from every quarter flocked in\r\nand new faces were to be counted by hundreds at Oakdale, Noblestown and\r\nMcDonald. The National-Transit Company laid a host of lines to keep the\r\ntanks from overflowing and Mellon Brothers operated an independent\r\npipe-line. Handling such an avalanche of oil was not child’s play and it\r\nwould have been utterly impossible in the era of wagons and flat-boats\r\non Oil Creek.\r\n\r\nMcDonald territory, if unparalleled in richness, in some respects\r\ntallied with portions of Oil Creek and the fourth-sand division of\r\nButler. Occasionally a dry-hole varied the monotony of the reports and\r\nruffled the plumage of disappointed seekers for gushers. Even the Mevey\r\nfarm trotted out dusters forty rods from Greenlee & Forst’s\r\nrecord-breaker. The “belt” was not continuous from McCurdy and dry-holes\r\nshortened it southward and narrowed it westward, but a field so prolific\r\nrequired little room to build up an overwhelming production. An engine\r\nmay exert the force of a thousand horses and the yield of the Greenlee &\r\nForst or the Matthews in sixty days exceeded that of a hundred average\r\nwells in a twelvemonth. The remotest likelihood of running against such\r\na snap was terribly fascinating to operators who had battled in the\r\nolder sections. They were not the men to let the chance slip and stay\r\naway from McDonald. Hence the field was defined quickly and the line of\r\nmarch resumed towards the southward, into Washington county and\r\nWest-Virginia.\r\n\r\nWrinkles, gray-hairs and sometimes oil-wells come to him who has\r\npatience to wait. Just as 1884 was expiring, the discovery of oil in a\r\nwell on the Gantz lot, a few rods from the Chartiers-Railroad depot,\r\nelectrified the ancient borough of Washington, midway between Pittsburg\r\nand Wheeling. The whole town gathered to see the grease spout above the\r\nderrick. Hundreds of oilmen hurried to pick up leases and jerk the\r\ntools. For six weeks a veil of mystery shrouded the well, which was then\r\nannounced to be of small account. Eight others had been started, but the\r\nterritory was deep, the rock was often hard, and the excited populace\r\nhad to wait six months for the answer to the drill.\r\n\r\nTraveling over Washington county in 1880, Frederick Crocker noticed its\r\nstrong geological resemblance to the upper oil-fields, which he knew\r\nintimately. The locality was directly on a line from the northern\r\ndistricts to points south that had produced oil. He organized the\r\nNiagara Oil-Company and sent agents to secure leases. Remembering the\r\ncollapse of Washington companies in 1860-1, when wells on Dunkard Creek\r\nattracted folks to Greene county, farmers held back their lands until\r\npublic-meetings and a house-to-house canvass satisfied them the Niagara\r\nmeant business. Blocks were leased in the northern tier of townships and\r\nin 1882 a test well was drilled on the McGuigan farm. An immense flow of\r\ngas was encountered at twenty-two-hundred feet and not a drop of oil.\r\nNot disheartened, the company went west three miles and sank a well on\r\nthe Buchanan farm, forty-two-hundred feet. Possibly the hole contained\r\noil, but it was plugged and the drillers proceeded to bore\r\nthirty-six-hundred feet on the Rush farm, four miles south. Jumping\r\neleven miles north-east, they obtained gas, salt-water and feeble spurts\r\nof oil from a well on the Scott farm. About this stage of the\r\nproceedings the People’s Light and Heat Company was organized to supply\r\nWashington with natural-gas. From three wells plenty of gas for the\r\npurpose was derived. A rival company drilled a well on the Gantz lot,\r\nadjacent to the town, which at twenty-one-hundred feet struck the vein\r\nof oil that threw the county-seat into spasms on the last day of 1884.\r\n\r\nThe fever broke out afresh in July of 1885, by a report that the Thayer\r\nwell, on the Farley farm, a mile south-west in advance of developments,\r\nhad “come in.” This well, located in an oatfield in a deep ravine, was\r\nworked as a mystery. Armed guards constantly kept watch and scouts\r\nreclining on the hill-top contented themselves with an unsatisfactory\r\npeep through a field-glass. One night a shock of oats approached within\r\nsixty feet of the derrick. The guard fired and the propelling power\r\nimmediately took to its heels and ran. Another night, while a crowd of\r\ndisinterested parties jangled with the guards, scouts gained entrance to\r\nthe derrick from the rear, but discovered no oil. Previous to this a\r\nscout had paid a midnight visit to the well, eluded the guards, boldly\r\nclimbed to the top of the derrick and with chalk marked the\r\ncrown-pulley. With the aid of their glasses the vigilant watchers on the\r\nhill-top counted the revolutions and calculated the length of cable\r\nneeded to reach the bottom of the well. A bolder move was to crawl under\r\nthe floor of the derrick. This was successfully accomplished by several\r\ndaring fellows, one of whom was caught in the act. He weighed\r\ntwo-hundred-and-forty pounds and his frantic struggles for a comfortable\r\nresting-place led to his discovery. A handful of cigars and a long pull\r\nat his pocket flask purchased his freedom. The well was a failure. R. H.\r\nThayer drilled four more good ones, one a gusher that netted him\r\nthree-thousand dollars a day for months. Other operators crowded in and\r\nwere rewarded with dusters of the most approved type.\r\n\r\nThe despondency following the failure of Thayer’s No. 1 was dispelled on\r\nAugust twenty-second. The People’s Light and Heat Company’s well, on the\r\nGordon farm, pierced a new sand two-hundred-and-sixty feet below the\r\nGantz formation, and oil commenced to scale the derrick. Again the\r\npetroleum-fever raged. An owner of the well, at church on Sunday\r\nmorning, suddenly awakened from his slumbers and horrified pastor and\r\ncongregation by yelling: “By George! There she spouts!” The day previous\r\nhe had seen the well flow and religious thoughts had been temporarily\r\nreplaced by dreams of a fortune. This well’s best day’s record was\r\none-hundred-and-sixty barrels. Test wells for the new Gordon sand were\r\nsunk in all directions and the Washington field had made a substantial\r\nbeginning. The effect on the inhabitants was marked. The price of wool\r\nno longer formed the staple of conversation, the new industry entirely\r\nsuperseding it. Real-estate values shot skyward and the borough\r\npopulation strode from five-thousand to seventy-five-hundred. The sturdy\r\nScotch-Presbyterians would not tolerate dance-houses, gambling-hells and\r\ndens of vice in a town that for twenty years had not permitted the sale\r\nof liquor. Time works wonders. Washington county, which fomented the\r\nWhisky Insurrection, was transformed into a prohibition stronghold. The\r\nfestive citizen intent upon a lark had to journey to Pittsburg or\r\nWheeling for his jag.\r\n\r\nCol. E. H. Dyer, whom the Gantz well allured to the new district, leased\r\nthe Calvin Smith farm, three miles north-east, and started the drill. He\r\nhad twenty years’ experience and very little cash. His funds giving out,\r\nhe offered the well and lease for five-hundred dollars. Willets & Young\r\nagreed to finish the well for two-thirds interest. They pounded the\r\nrock, drilled through the fifth sand and hit “the fifty-foot” nearer\r\nChina. In January of 1886 the well-Dyer No. 1—flowed four-hundred\r\nbarrels a day. Expecting gas or a dry-hole, from the absence of oil in\r\nthe customary sand, the owners had not erected tanks and the stream\r\nwasted for several days. Dyer sold his remaining one-third to Joseph W.\r\nCraig, a well-known operator in the Oil-City and Pittsburg\r\noil-exchanges, for seventy-five-thousand dollars. He organized the\r\nMascot Oil-Company, located the McGahey in another section of the field\r\nand pocketed two-hundred-thousand dollars for his year’s work in\r\nWashington county. The Smith proved to be the creamiest farm in the\r\nfield, returning Willets, Young and Craig six-hundred-thousand dollars.\r\nCalvin Smith was a hired man in 1876, working by the month on the farm\r\nhe bought in 1883, paying a small amount and arranging to string out the\r\nbalance in fifteen annual instalments. His one-eighth royalty fattened\r\nhis bank-account in eighteen months to six figures, an achievement\r\ncreditable to the scion of the multitudinous Smith-family.\r\n\r\nFrom the sinking of the Dyer well drilling went on recklessly. Everybody\r\nfelt confident of a great future for Washington territory. Isaac\r\nWillets, brother of an owner of the Smith tract, paid sixty-thousand\r\ndollars for the adjoining farm—the Munce—and spent two-hundred-thousand\r\nin wells that cleared him a plump half-million. John McKeown the same\r\nday bought the farm of the Munce heirs, directly north of their uncle’s,\r\nand drilled wells that yielded him five-thousand dollars a day. He\r\nremoved to Washington and died there. His widow erected a\r\nsixty-thousand-dollar monument over his grave, something that would\r\nnever have happened if John, plain, hard-headed and unpretentious, could\r\nhave expressed his sentiments. Thayer No. 2, on the Clark farm,\r\nadjoining the Gordon, startled the fraternity in May of 1886 by flowing\r\ntwo-thousand barrels a day from the Gordon sand. It was the biggest\r\nspouter in the heap. Lightning struck the tank and burned the gusher,\r\nthe blazing oil shooting flames a hundred feet towards the blue canopy.\r\nAt night the brilliant light illumined the country for miles, travelers\r\npronouncing it equal to Mt. Vesuvius in active eruption. The burning oil\r\nran to Gordon No. 1, on lower ground, setting it off also. In a week the\r\nThayer blaze was doused and the stream of crude turned into the tanks of\r\nNo. 1. Next night a tool-dresser, carrying a lantern on his way to\r\n“midnight tower,” set fire to the gas which hung around the tanks. The\r\nflames once more shot above the tree-tops, the tool-dresser saved his\r\nlife only by rolling into the creek, but the derrick was saved and no\r\ndamage resulted to the well.\r\n\r\nCaptain J. J. Vandergrift leased the Barre farm, south of the Smith, and\r\ndrilled a series of gushers that added materially to his great wealth.\r\nDisposing of the Barre, he developed the Taylorstown pool and reaped a\r\nfortune. T. J. Vandergrift leased the McManis farm, six miles south of\r\nWashington, and located the first Taylorstown well. Taylorstown is still\r\non duty and W. J. Young manages the company that acquired the\r\nVandergrift interests. South of the Barre farm James Stewart, vendor of\r\na cure-all salve, owned a shanty and three acres of land worth\r\nfour-hundred dollars. He leased to Joseph M. Craig for one-fourth\r\nroyalty. The one well drilled on the lot spouted two-thousand barrels a\r\nday for weeks. It is now pumping fairly. This was salve for Stewart and\r\nliniment for Craig, whose Washington winnings exceed a half-million.\r\n“Mammy” Miller, an aged colored woman, lived on a small lot next to\r\nStewart and leased it at one-fourth royalty to a couple of local\r\nmerchants. They drilled a thousand-barrel well and “Mammy” became the\r\nmost courted negress in Pennsylvania. The Union Oil-Company took\r\nfour-hundred-thousand dollars from the Davis farm. Patrick Galligan, the\r\ncontractor of the Smith well, leased the Taylor farm and grew rich. Pew\r\n& Emerson, who have made millions by natural-gas operations, leased the\r\nManifold farm, west of the Smith. The first well paid them\r\ntwenty-thousand dollars a month and subsequent strikes manifolded this a\r\nnumber of times. Pew & Emerson have risen by their energy and shrewdness\r\nand can occupy a front pew in the congregation of petroleumites.\r\n\r\nSamuel Fergus, once county-treasurer and a man of broad mould, struck a\r\ngeyser in the Fergus annex to the main pool. He drilled on his\r\ntwenty-four acres solely to accommodate Robert Greene, pumper for Davis\r\nBrothers. Greene had much faith and no money, but he advised Fergus to\r\nexercise the tools at a particular spot. Fergus might have kept the\r\nwhole hog and not merely a pork-chop. He sold three-eighths and carried\r\none-eighth for Greene, who refused twenty-thousand dollars for it the\r\nday the well began flowing two-thousand barrels. “Bob” Greene, like\r\nArtemas Ward’s kangaroo, was “a amoosin’ cuss!” Called to Bradford\r\nshortly after the gusher was struck, he met an old acquaintance at the\r\nstation. His friend invited Bob into the smoker to enjoy a good cigar.\r\nHe declined and in language more expressive than elegant said: “I’ve\r\nbeen a ridin’ in smokers all my life. Now I’m goin’ to turn a new leaf.\r\nI’m goin’ to take a gentleman’s car to Pittsburg and from there to\r\nBradford I’m goin’ to have a Pullman, if it takes a hull day’s\r\nproduction.” Bob took his first ride in a Pullman accordingly. The first\r\nventure induced Fergus to punch his patch full of holes and do a turn at\r\nwildcatting. His stalwart luck fired the hearts of many young farmers to\r\nimitate him, in some instances successfully. Washington has not yet gone\r\nout of the oil-business. The Cecil pool kept the trade guessing this\r\nyear, but its gushers lacked endurance and the field no longer\r\nterrorizes the weakest lambkin in the speculative fold.\r\n\r\nGreene county experienced its first baptism of petroleum in 1861-2-3,\r\nwhen many wells were drilled on Dunkard Creek. The general result was\r\nunsatisfactory. The idea of boring two-thousand feet for oil had not\r\nbeen conceived and the shallow holes did not reach the principal strata.\r\nOf fourth sand, fifth sand, Gordon rock, fifty-foot rock, Trenton rock,\r\nBerea grit, corn-meal rock, Big-Injun sand and others of the deep-down\r\nbrand operators on Dunkard Creek never dreamed. Some oil was detected\r\nand more blocks of land were tied up in 1864-5. The credulous natives\r\nactually believed their county would soon be shedding oil from every\r\nhill and hollow, garden and pasture-field. The holders of the\r\ntracts—lessees for speculation only—drilled a trifle, sold interests to\r\nany suckers wanting to bite and the promised developments fizzled. E. M.\r\nHukill, who started in 1868 at Rouseville, leased twenty-thousand acres\r\nin 1885 and located a well on D. L. Donley’s farm, one-third mile\r\nsouth-east of the modest hamlet of Mt. Morris. Morris Run empties into\r\nDunkard Creek near the village. The tools were swung on March second,\r\n1886. Fishing-jobs, hard rock and varied hindrances impeded the work. On\r\nOctober twenty-first oil spouted, two flows occurred next day and a tank\r\nwas constructed. Saltwater bothered it and the well—twenty-two-hundred\r\nfeet—was not worth the pains taken for months to work it as a mystery.\r\nHukill drilled a couple of dusters and the Gregg well at Willowtree was\r\nalso a dry-hole at twenty-three hundred feet. Craig & Cappeau and James\r\nM. Guffey & Co. swept over the south-western section in an expensive\r\nsearch for crude. From the northern limit of McKean to the southern\r\nborder of Greene county Pennsylvania had been ransacked. The Keystone\r\nplayers—Venango, Warren, Forest, Elk, McKean, Clarion, Armstrong,\r\nButler, Allegheny, Beaver and Washington—put up a stiff game and the\r\nregion across the Ohio was to have its innings.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1881 Butler capitalists drilled a well on the Smith\r\nfarm, near Baldridge, seven miles south of the county-seat. It had a\r\nnice white sand and a smell of oil. S. Simcox, J. J. Myers and Porter\r\nPhipps leased the land on which Renfrew now stands and put down a hole\r\non the Hamill tract. The well showed only a freshet of salt-water until\r\nthirty feet in the third sand, when it flowed crude at a hundred-barrel\r\ngait. This strike, in March of 1882, boomed the territory below Butler\r\nand ushered in Baldridge and Renfrew. Milton Stewart and Lyman Stewart\r\nwere interested with Simcox, Myers and Phipps in the property and helped\r\norganize the Bullion Salt-Water Company.\r\n\r\nThe Cecil pool, in Washington county, furnishes its oil from the\r\nfifty-foot sand. One well, finished in April of 1895, on a village lot,\r\nflowed thirty-three hundred barrels in twenty-four hours. The biggest\r\nstrike at Legionville, Beaver county, was Haymaker’s seven-hundred\r\nbarreler. The Shoustown or Shannopin field, also in Beaver, sixteen\r\nmiles from Pittsburg, is owned principally by James Amm & Co. Coraopolis\r\nis a thriving oil town, fifteen miles west of the Smoky City. For miles\r\nalong the Ohio derricks are quite plentiful. Greene county has been\r\ndecidedly brisk in this year of grace and cheap petroleum. And so the\r\ntide rolls on and “thus wags the world away.”\r\n\r\nThe southern trail, with its magnificent Butler output, its Allegheny\r\ngeysers, its sixteen-thousand barrels a day in Washington and its\r\nwonderful strikes in Greene, was big enough to fill the bill and lap\r\nover all the edges.\r\n\r\nHITS AND MISSES.\r\n\r\nA Bradford minister, when the Academy of Music burned down, shot wide of\r\nthe mark in attributing the fire to “the act of God.” Sensible\r\nChristians resented the imputation that God would destroy a dozen houses\r\nand stores to wipe out a variety-theater, or that He had anything to do\r\nwith building up a trade in arson and figuring as an incendiary.\r\n\r\n                He struck a match and the gas exploded;\r\n                An angel now, he knows it was loaded.\r\n\r\n“Mariar, what book was you readin’ so late last night?” asked a stiff\r\nPresbyterian father at Franklin. “It was a novel by Dumas the elder.”\r\n“‘Elder!’ I don’t believe it. What church was he elder on, Ish’d like to\r\nknow, and writ novels? Go and read Dr. Eaton’s Presbytery uv Erie.”\r\n\r\nHymn-singing is not always appropriate, or a St. Petersburg leader would\r\nnot have started “When I Can Read My Title Clear” to the minstrel-melody\r\nof “Wait for the Wagon and We’ll All Take a Ride!” At an immersion in\r\nthe river below Tidioute, as each convert, male or female, emerged\r\ndripping from the water, the people interjected the revivalist chorus:\r\n\r\n                    “They look like men in uniform,\r\n                      They look like men of war!”\r\n\r\nMr. Gray, of Boston, once discovered a “non-explosive illuminating\r\ngasoline.” To show how safe the new compound was, he invited a number of\r\nfriends to his rooms, whither he had taken a barrel of the fluid, which\r\nhe proceeded to stir with a red-hot poker. As they all went through the\r\nroof he endeavored to explain to his nearest companion that the\r\nparticular fluid in the barrel had too much benzine in it, but the\r\ngentleman said he had engagements higher up and could not wait for the\r\nexplanation. Mr. Gray continued his ascent until he met Mr. Jones, who\r\ninformed him that there was no necessity to go higher, as everybody was\r\ncoming down; so Mr. Gray started back to be with the party. Mr. Gray’s\r\nwidow offered the secret for the manufacture of the non-explosive fluid\r\nat a reduced rate, to raise money to buy a silver-handled coffin with a\r\ngilt plate for her departed husband.\r\n\r\n            The speech of a youth who goes courting a lass,\r\n            Unless he’s a dunce at the foot of the class,\r\n            Is sure to be season’d with natural gas.\r\n\r\nGrant Thomas, train-dispatcher at Oil City of the Allegheny-Valley\r\nRailroad, is one of the jolliest jokers alive. When a conductor years\r\nago a young lady of his acquaintance said to him: “I think that Smith\r\ngirl is just too hateful; she’s called her nasty pug after me!” “Oh,”\r\nreplied the genial ticket-puncher, in a tone meant to pour oil on the\r\ntroubled waters, “that’s nothing; half the cats in Oil City are called\r\nafter me!” The girl saw the point, laughed heartily and the angel of\r\npeace hovered over the scene.\r\n\r\n               “What’s in a name?” so Shakespeare wrote.\r\n               Well, a good deal when fellows vote,\r\n               Want a check cashed, or sign a note;\r\n               And when an oilman sinks a well,\r\n               Dry as the jokes of Digby Bell,\r\n               Dennis or Mud fits like a shell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEWS ON THE TARR FARM, OIL CREEK, IN 1863-6.]\r\n\r\n                                      TARR HOMESTEAD IN 1862\r\n                           WELLS ON TARR FARM\r\n             LOWER TARR FARM\r\n            PHILLIPS AND WOODFORD WELLS\r\n                                            JAMES S.

JENNINGS.]\r\n\r\nPennsylvania was not to be the solitary oyster in the stew, the one and\r\nonly winner in the petroleum-game. Although the Keystone State raked in\r\nthe first jack-pot on Oil Creek with the Drake royal-flush, rival\r\nplayers were billed for an early appearance. Ohio, always ready to\r\nfurnish presidents and office-holders for the whole nation, was equally\r\nwilling to gather riches by the oleaginous route and dealt Mecca as its\r\ninitial trump in the summer of 1860. Years before a farmer near the\r\nquiet town in Trumbull county, digging a well for water, found an\r\nevil-smelling liquid and promptly filled up the hole. This supplied a\r\ncue to J. H. Hoxie, after the news of Drake’s experiment reached him,\r\nand he sank a shallow well close to the farmer’s unlucky venture.\r\nPiercing a covering of dirt twenty feet and coarse sand-rock ten feet,\r\nthe tools unlocked a reservoir of dark oil, which responded to the pump\r\nwith the vehemence of a Venango spouter. Estimates of the daily yield,\r\nmuch of which floated down stream, varied from one-hundred to\r\nthree-hundred barrels. Probably forty to fifty would be nearer the real\r\nfigure. The oil, 26° gravity and very dark green in color, was a\r\nsuperior lubricant. This new phase of “the Ohio Idea” brought multitudes\r\nof visitors to the scene. Mecca became the mecca of all sorts, sizes and\r\nconditions of worshippers at the greasian shrine. To come and see was to\r\ndesire a chance in the exciting lottery. Hoxie, elated beyond measure\r\nover the strike, traveled around the country to magnify the field and\r\nhis own connection with it. Small leases were gobbled eagerly for a\r\nsmall cash-bonus and a royalty, sometimes half the oil done up in\r\nbarrels. A three-pole derrick, a spring-pole and light tools hitched to\r\na rope sufficed to “kick down” a well. Depths ranged from thirty feet to\r\none-hundred. Portable engines and boilers followed when hand-power\r\nweakened and the wells must be pumped steadily. Rude drilling-outfits\r\nand board-shanties went up by hundreds. Needy adventurers might secure\r\nan acre of ground and sprout into prosperous oilmen in twenty or thirty\r\ndays. The tempting bait was snapped at greedily. Rig-builders,\r\ncarpenters, teamsters, tool-dressers, laborers, shop-keepers, saloonists\r\nand speculators crowded the busy spot in quest of jobs, locations or\r\neasy victims. Mecca seemed too far off, so a genuine “oil-town,” lacking\r\nnone of the earmarks of such creations, was established on the James\r\nCowdey farm and labeled Oil Diggings. It soon sported a post-office,\r\nwhich distributed stacks of mail, machine-shops, groceries and\r\nboarding-houses galore; nor were groggeries, gambling-dens and the usual\r\nincidentals difficult to discover.\r\n\r\nThe opening months of 1861 swelled the excitement and the population.\r\nThe bright and the dark sides were not far apart. Many who came with\r\nhigh expectations in January returned disappointed in June. The field\r\nhad extended south from Power’s Corners, substantial frames enclosed\r\nnumerous wells and a refinery was erected. Yet the good quality of the\r\noil was scantily appreciated until most of the wells had been about\r\nexhausted. Often it went begging vainly for purchasers in Cleveland or\r\nBuffalo. Then the price advanced, actually reaching fifty-two dollars a\r\nbarrel in 1863-4. Adulteration with cheaper oils deteriorated the\r\nproduct and it dropped below a paying rate. Operators realized in the\r\nautumn of 1861 that the territory was declining rapidly and the wiser\r\nones departed. Some held on a year or two longer, drilled their wells\r\nfive-hundred feet in hope of hitting other sands and quit at last.\r\nGeorge Moral, a one-eyed veteran of the war, has stuck to the Shaeffer\r\nfarm, at the southern end of the district, and he is still getting a\r\nmorsel of oil from a nest of shallow wells. The forest of derricks and\r\nengine-houses has disappeared. Oil Diggings is a tradition and “Ichabod”\r\nis written over the once stirring district.\r\n\r\n       “Old Rhinestein’s walls are crumbled now.\r\n       Stern Ruin’s ploughshare drives elate full on thy bloom.”\r\n\r\nMix & Force were, perhaps, the most successful Mecca operators. It was\r\nhard to extract the heavy oil from the rock by ordinary processes.\r\nCalvin Adams, of Pittsburg, conceived the idea of sinking a shaft and\r\ndrifting into the sand, exactly as in gold-mining. He employed four men,\r\npumped the oil and water that seeped in and hoisted lots of rock to the\r\nsurface, where steam was used to force out the greasy fluid that\r\nsaturated the sand. This novel method paid while oil was high-priced,\r\nbut was too expensive when the stuff went zero-wards. The oil-bearing\r\nrock, known as Berea grit, lay in flat formations and was somewhat\r\nporous. Mr. Rider removed his refinery to Oil Creek in 1862, since which\r\nperiod refining has been a lost art in Trumbull county. Everybody has\r\nheard of the resolute pioneer who, bound for Colorado by the overland\r\nline of prairie-schooners, inscribed on his Conestoga wagon: “Pike’s\r\nPeak or Bust!” He was distanced by a band of petroleum-seekers at Oil\r\nDiggings. The jokers built their engine-house and belt-house parallel\r\nwith the public road and emblazoned in two-foot capitals on the derrick:\r\n“Oil, Hell or China!” James A. Garfield, afterwards Chief Magistrate of\r\nthe United States—he was a pilgrim to Mecca and owned an interest in the\r\n“Preachers’ Wells,” among the best in the bundle—once quoted this legend\r\nin Congress. Paying his respects pointedly to “Sunset” Cox, who\r\nrepresented an Ohio district in the House and had failed of re-election,\r\nGarfield closed with these words:\r\n\r\n“My friend found in the late election a decided majority against him.\r\nEvidently he is going down, down, down until, in the language of an\r\noil-explorer, he comes to ‘OIL, HELL OR CHINA!’”\r\n\r\nGarfield left Oil Diggings when the bubble burst, served term after term\r\nin Congress, went to the White House and perished by the bullet of a\r\nvile assassin. Cox left Ohio for New York, secured the good-will of\r\nTammany, went back to Congress repeatedly, died years ago and was\r\nhonored with a statue in Astor Place. Both were political leaders on\r\nopposing sides and warm personal friends, both gained world-wide\r\ncelebrity, both were Ohioans and oil-producers, and both retained to the\r\nlast that “chastity of honor which felt a stain like a wound.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MICHAEL EDIC HESS.]\r\n\r\nM. E. Hess, for thirty years a respected citizen of Pennsylvania, began\r\nhis oil-career at Mecca. He came to Oil Creek in the sixties, formed a\r\npartnership with Franklin S. Tarbell and operated largely in various\r\nsections. He was prominent in the Clarion field and took up his abode at\r\nEdenburg. There, as wherever he lived, he has been active in\r\nchurch-work, in building up a religious sentiment and in furthering the\r\nbest interests of the community. He has served acceptably in the\r\nborough-council and is now justice of the peace. Upright in his life and\r\ncharacter, sincere in his friendships, kind to the poor and trustworthy\r\neverywhere, M. E. Hess deserves the high place he has always held in\r\npopular regard. The passing years have touched him lightly, his heart is\r\nyoung, he is “not slothful in business” and he trains with the “men who\r\ncan hear the Decalogue and feel no self-reproach.”\r\n\r\n               “An honest man’s the noblest work of God.”\r\n\r\nThe south-east border of Ohio next experienced the petroleum-revival.\r\nThe region about Marietta, where surface-signs of greasiness were noted\r\na century ago, for years enjoyed its full share of satisfactory\r\ndevelopments. Three or four counties have been covered satisfactorily,\r\nproducing from the Big Injun sand. The Benwood pool, in Monroe county,\r\nintroduced by a big well on the Price farm in August of 1896, has\r\nyielded liberally and is still the object of respectful attention.\r\nMacksburg, sufficiently important in 1881 to hold the entire oil-trade\r\nin mortal suspense for weeks, is on hand with a small output. John\r\nDenman, of Bradford, and Thomas Mills were pioneers in the field and did\r\na turn in working the “mystery racket.” Hundreds assembled to watch the\r\ntorpedoing of their frontier-well, four miles east of Macksburg, kept in\r\nabeyance a month for speculative purposes. Natives, with their wives and\r\nfamilies, lined the hillside to behold the novel sight. Col. John J.\r\nCarter had arranged a system of flag-signals and stationed men to wave\r\nthe news to Dexter City, five miles away. The swiftest horse in the\r\ncounty was at my service, to bear my message to the nearest\r\ntelegraph-office for transmission to the New-York Oil-Exchange. George\r\nH. Nesbit, L. E. Mallory, Denman and a dozen other Pennsylvania\r\noperators stood by. Hours were frittered away, until the exchanges had\r\nclosed, before the shell was lowered into the hole. The reaction\r\nfollowing the explosion came at last. A column of water rose mildly a\r\nfew feet in the air and—that was all! The much-vaunted well, which\r\nthrottled the great petroleum-industry three or four weeks, was\r\npractically a failure and never rose above the five-barrel grade!\r\n\r\n           “The mountain labored and brought forth a mouse.”\r\n\r\nA thousand barrels a day was the average yield of the south-eastern\r\ndivision in 1896. George Rice’s refinery at Marietta treated the bulk of\r\nthe production at the primitive stage of developments. It was a\r\nrice-pudding for Rice, who is a thoroughbred hustler and wastes no love\r\nupon anyone who may encroach upon his particular preserve. He has loads\r\nof pluck and enterprise and the staying quality that is desirable alike\r\nin oilmen and oil-territory, to say nothing of bull-dogs and\r\nprize-fighters.\r\n\r\n            “‘Thrice is he armed who hath his quarrel just,’\r\n            And four times he who gets his work in fust.”\r\n\r\nThe great Lima field, spreading over a dozen counties in North-western\r\nOhio, was the star performer of the Buckeye galaxy. Centering in Allen,\r\nHancock, Wood and Seneca, it has grasped big slices of the bordering\r\ncounties, with a strip of Lucas for good measure. Gas-indications in\r\nHancock, which resulted in a large well at Findlay in 1884, set the ball\r\nrolling. Others were drilled forthwith, one on the Kramer farm getting\r\nfive barrels of oil a day. Findlay and Bowling Green had dipped into the\r\nTrenton rock profitably, but nobody thought a huge oil-field at all\r\nlikely to be encountered. The Strawboard Works at Lima, in Allen county,\r\nsouth-west of Hancock, needed more water and the manager decided to\r\ndrill for water and gas. The hole was punched through the Trenton rock\r\nand pronounced a rank failure for gas. The company exploded a torpedo in\r\nthe barren rock on April twelfth, 1885. To the astonishment of owners\r\nand spectators, the well sent out a stream of oil. It was tubed and\r\npumped fifteen barrels a day. Such was the modest beginning of an\r\noil-district destined to cause a greater stir than Grover Cleveland’s\r\nboy-baby or Albert Edward’s green necktie.\r\n\r\n              There were no flies on Lima that glad day;\r\n              Great expectations had the right of way,\r\n              For the oil-boom had come, and come to stay.\r\n\r\nIt was “the old, old story.” The Queen of Sheba doubted the reports of\r\nSolomon’s grandeur until she sized up the outfit personally and\r\ndeclared: “The half has not been told.” Outsiders doubted the truth of a\r\npaying strike at Lima, and doubted its importance after seeing the well\r\nand the contents of the tank. The oil had a sickly tint and an odor that\r\n“smelled to heaven.” People sniffed the dreadful aroma and proclaimed\r\nthe oil good only for fuel. A few Limans thought differently and\r\norganized the Citizens’ Gas-Company to help play the game to a finish.\r\nNot a cloud of gas, but a forty-barrel pumper, was the result in\r\nDecember. Regardless of tint or odor, outsiders and insiders hastened to\r\nget drilling-sites. By May first, 1886, sixteen wells on town-lots were\r\nproducing nicely. George P. Waldorf and James B. Townsend, residents of\r\nLima, were the first to lease a farm in the neighborhood, at one-eighth\r\nroyalty. They visited Bradford, returned with David Kirk and Isaac E.\r\nDean, formed the Trenton-Rock Oil-Company, leased many lots and\r\nfifty-thousand acres of land, set strings of tools boring and soon piled\r\nup a tidy production. The year closed with two-hundred wells doing\r\nnine-thousand barrels, which the Buckeye Pipe-Line transported and\r\nstored. Operations extended north-east and south-west, until\r\nthirty-thousand wells were drilled and a half-million acres of territory\r\nopened. Findlay, Lima, Fostoria and Toledo were strictly in the swim.\r\nThe deluge of grease swelled to mammoth proportions. Iron-tanks stored\r\nthirty-million barrels, while iron-pipes bore other millions east and\r\nwest. Refineries used what they could, Ohio oil netting a smaller\r\npercentage of kerosene than Pennsylvania crude, and in 1889 the price\r\ncrawled down to fifteen cents. Think of it—fifteen cents for forty-two\r\ngallons of oil pumped from twelve-hundred feet beneath the earth’s\r\nsurface!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIMA OIL-FIELDS.]\r\n\r\nDevelopments covered large areas in Hancock and Wood counties, took in a\r\nstrip of Allen and Auglaize one to three miles wide, and extended\r\nsouth-west to St. Mary’s, thirty miles from Lima. They reached\r\nnorth-east into Sandusky and Ottawa, east into Seneca, north into Lucas\r\nand west into Van Wert and across the state-line into Indiana. Wood\r\ncounty stood at the top of the heap, with the rest as offshoots. Its\r\nfirst well, drilled three miles north of North Baltimore by T. J.\r\nVandergrift & Co., cantered off in March, 1888, at four-hundred barrels.\r\nThe second, put down three miles east a year later by Bowling-Green\r\ntenderfeet, rated as a fifteen-hundred barreler. Smith & Zeigler’s, on\r\nthe adjoining farm, outdid this three to one by bowling out\r\nfive-thousand barrels per diem. The plot thickened very rapidly. Gushers\r\ntumbled into line at a dizzy pace. Cygnet lots boasted clusters of\r\nderricks that marked king-pin strikes. Agents of the Standard bought\r\nthousands of wells and the cream of the territory. The product fed a\r\nmyriad furnace-fires in Chicago and the half-mile battery of\r\nsteam-boilers at the Columbian Exposition. In Sandusky county, whose\r\nearliest wells, at Gibsonburg in 1888, were by no means aggressive, T.\r\nE. Kirkbride called the turn on a six-thousand-barrel spouter in\r\nNovember, 1894. Altogether the Ohio oil-region, with its eastern pool in\r\nTrumbull county, its south-eastern branch in Washington, Monroe and\r\nNoble and its vast deposit of gas and petroleum in the north-western\r\nsection, was a startling revelation. But all the territory was not\r\nvelvet, as eight-thousand dry-holes attest. No leopard could be more\r\nspotted. The present average yield of the wells is under four barrels,\r\nwith sixty-six cents as the average price last year. Five-sixths of the\r\ntwenty-four-million barrels Ohio produced in 1896 must be credited to\r\nthe north-western colossus.\r\n\r\nThomas E. Kirkbride, the man that owned the well that raised the smell\r\nthat set the pace that led the race that broke the slate that it was\r\nfate that Coxey’s state should elevate, hails from Tidioute, where his\r\nparents located in 1866. He started in oil young, operated in the Warren\r\nand Bradford fields, caught the Ohio fever and landed at Findlay in\r\n1890. His first ventures were around Gibsonburg, four miles west of\r\nwhich, on the Jones farm, he drilled the gusher that smashed the Lima\r\nrecord and fattened his bank-account six figures.\r\n\r\nMr. Kirkbride lives at Toledo, in a handsome home gladdened by a devoted\r\nwife and five children. S. M. Jones, the distinguished Mayor of Toledo,\r\nalso came from the Keystone State. He drilled in the lower oil-districts\r\nin 1868, joined the tide for Bradford and located at Duke Centre. Thence\r\nhe migrated to Toledo, patented a sucker-rod improvement, erected a big\r\nfactory, dabbled skilfully in municipal affairs, advocated civic reforms\r\nand won the mayoralty on the grand platform of “eight hours work a day.”\r\nMr. Jones helped organize the Western Oilmen’s Association, which\r\noccupies fine quarters in the heart of the city. There Fred Boden, W. J.\r\nMcCullagh, Frank Steele, C. A. Lupher and other Keystoners often hang\r\nout to welcome old friends from Pennsylvania. W. B. Nolan, who pumped at\r\nOil City in 1864 and operated from Edenburg to Bradford, has drilled\r\nfive-hundred wells in Ohio for himself or by contract. C. C. Harris, who\r\nsold to the Ohio Oil-Company in 1890 for one-hundred-thousand dollars,\r\nhas put down four-hundred. Truly the Buckeye State is no slouch in\r\npetroleum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELLS ON TOWN LOTS AT CYGNET, OHIO.]\r\n\r\nA farmer in the Black Swamp of Wood county, half-starved on corn-bread\r\nand bad water, leased his forty-acre patch for oil-purposes. The first\r\nwell, which was sunk a hundred yards from his cabin, flowed two-thousand\r\nbarrels a day. When the spurt began the old fellow happened to be\r\nchopping wood beside his door. He saw the mass of oil climb into the\r\natmosphere, flung down his axe and shouted: “Bet yer life, no more\r\ncorn-dodgers an’ watered whisky for this chicken!”\r\n\r\nA barren streak in Mercer and Van Wert, on Ohio’s western border, seemed\r\nto demonstrate the folly of seeking an extension of the Lima belt in\r\nIndiana, despite convincing symptoms of oil at Geneva. To test the\r\nmatter the Northern-Indiana Oil-Company, composed mainly of Lima\r\noperators, leased five-thousand acres along the boundary between Adams\r\nand Jay counties and drilled several wells in 1892. Nearly the whole\r\nrange proved productive, showing that the belt stretched westward.\r\nPortions of Wells, Blackford, Grant and Huntingdon joined the procession\r\nin due course. Last year an important pool was unearthed near\r\nAlexandria, Madison county, twenty-five miles south-west of the original\r\nfield, which demanded a pipe-line to Montpelier. This newest accession\r\nis in the town of Peru, with spurs quite close to Cass county. This has\r\nbeen the stellar attraction of Hoosierdom, fifty-five wells completed in\r\nOctober of 1897 yielding thirty-five-hundred barrels. Roan, New Waverley\r\nand Denver have not escaped and the drill has invaded Kokomo, twenty\r\nmiles south. Peru is the fad of the hour, the pride of the Wabash. Just\r\nclear across the state, several wells at Terre Haute have revealed the\r\npresence of sand, gas and oil. The average price of Indiana crude in\r\n1896 was sixty-three cents, and five-million barrels were produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIT OF INDIANA OIL-TERRITORY.]\r\n\r\nThe Indiana oil-region is a level country, about forty miles long east\r\nand west and three to four wide. The oil, dark green in color and\r\nthirty-six gravity, is found in the Trenton limestone, at a depth of a\r\nthousand feet. Thirty to a hundred feet of driving-pipe and\r\nthree-hundred feet of casing are needed in each well. The main belt runs\r\nin regular pools and may be considered ten-barrel territory. The\r\naggregate production of the field is twelve to fifteen-thousand barrels\r\na day. The largest well started at two-thousand barrels and some have\r\nrecords of five-hundred to eight-hundred. The great gas-field, south of\r\nthe oil-belt, has boomed manufactures and contributed vastly to the\r\nwealth of the Hoosiers.\r\n\r\nLast May the Byram Oil-Company of Indianapolis finished the first\r\noil-well, within sight of the village of Dundee, ever drilled by\r\nelectricity. A fifty-horse dynamo, which runs the small motors at a\r\ndozen wells on the tract, supplied the power. Gas is used under the\r\nboilers in the power-house, a substantial frame-building, which shelters\r\nthe central station. The entire plant cost five-thousand dollars and the\r\ncompany votes it a success of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nHiram Tewksbury, of Montpelier, who pays taxes on six-hundred acres of\r\nland in Wells county, is one of the few men whom getting into a lawsuit\r\nenriched. When the Indiana field was in its infancy he contracted to\r\npurchase the Howard farm for some oilmen, who refused to take it off his\r\nhands and were sustained by the Court. He sued Howard to take it back,\r\nthe Supreme Court decided against him and Tewksbury had to keep the\r\nland. It turned out to be the bosom of an oil-pool, the cream of the\r\ndistrict. One acre brought Tewksbury eleven-thousand dollars, and for\r\nmonths his royalty exceeded five-hundred dollars a week.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES W. ROWLAND.]\r\n\r\nPeru, a natty place of ten-thousand inhabitants, twelve miles east of\r\nLogansport, is the Indiana sensation of the year. Last June a bevy of\r\ncitizens drilled a duster on the Wallace farm, two miles east. This dose\r\nof Peruvian bark spurred them to drill on the north-west edge of town in\r\nJuly. The well flowed fifteen barrels a day through the casing, at\r\ntwenty feet in the Trenton rock, increasing ten-fold when tubed and\r\npumped. At once the oil craze ran riot in the wild rush for leases.\r\nTourists from Ohio and Pennsylvania led the long procession of\r\nland-seekers. The Klondyke pool east of Toledo and the Hume south of\r\nLima were forgotten temporarily. Scores of slick wells demolished the\r\ntheory of a mere “pocket,” which the absence of gas and scarcity of\r\nsalt-water led would-be scientists to expect at the first blush. The\r\ngood work has crowded ahead and Peru roosts high on the petroleum-perch\r\nin the center of the patch.\r\n\r\n                 A dandy thing it is to be on top,\r\n                 Provided you don’t have to take a drop\r\n                 And come down with a thud, kerflop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. C. ZEIGLER.]\r\n\r\nThirteen per cent. of the five-thousand wells drilled in Benjamin\r\nHarrison’s state are dry-holes. Montpelier has benefited largely from\r\noperations in Wells, Blackford and Jay counties. The Sibley Oil-Company,\r\nIsaac N. Patterson, the Rowland-Zeigler Oil-Company and other\r\nPennsylvania firms and individuals have been prominent in the field. Mr.\r\nPatterson lives at Franklin, is president of the savings bank and has\r\nfigured extensively in the chief districts since Petroleum Centre and\r\nPithole first tinctured the horizon a flaming red. James W. Rowland quit\r\nmercantile-life in Franklin to conduct a bank at Emlenton and embark in\r\nthe oil-business. The success he richly merited attended him in banking,\r\nproducing and refining. He gained a liberal fortune, returned to\r\nFranklin and took a leading share in developing the Indiana region. Mr.\r\nRowland is a first-class man of affairs, genial and generous, true to\r\nhis convictions, loyal in his friendships and always ready to further a\r\ngood cause. The Rowland-Zeigler Company sold to the Standard recently at\r\na price which hugged a quarter-million dollars closely. H. C. Zeigler,\r\nwho managed and was president of the company, began his oil-career as\r\nowner of an interest in the first two producing wells at Raymilton,\r\ndrilled in 1869. Operating at Pleasantville a short season, the\r\nfourth-sand development attracted him to Petrolia. In 1873 he and J. D.\r\nRitchey and W. T. Jackson procured a charter for the Cleveland\r\nPipe-Line, which was sold to S. D. Karns and merged into the Karns Line.\r\nAssisting in the management of the Karns Line until the United Lines\r\nabsorbed it, he then engaged actively in producing oil. His circuit of\r\noperations comprised Bullion, Cogley, Thorn Creek, Cherry Grove,\r\nBradford and Richburg. Moving westward, he participated in the early\r\ndevelopment of the Ohio and Indiana fields. In company with Jacob S.\r\nSmith he established the plant that supplied natural-gas to Chicago. His\r\nmaster-stroke was the organization of the Rowland-Zeigler Company, which\r\nalone realized him a competence. Mr. Zeigler is in his prime, hearty and\r\nvigorous, quick to relieve distress and prompt to aid the right. None\r\nbetter deserves the compliment George D. Prentice paid Mark M. Pomeroy:\r\n“He is a brick.”\r\n\r\nJohn and Michael Cudahy, behind whom Philip Armour, the Swifts,\r\nFairbanks and Nelson Morris, the Chicago beef-magnates, are supposed to\r\npose, in 1895 purchased a huge slice of the Indiana field, laid a\r\npipe-line to the Windy City and talked of building a refinery that would\r\noutshine the Standard giant at Whiting. The brothers are sons of an\r\nIrish resident of Milwaukee, who taught them his own trade of\r\nmeat-packing. Michael Cudahy went to Chicago to manage a branch for John\r\nPlankington, whom the Armours succeeded, and John “came tumbling after.”\r\nJohn piled up millions by plunges in pork and lard that won him the\r\nsoubriquet of “Daring Jack” Cudahy, while Michael stuck to Armour\r\nfaithfully. John toppled and lost his wealth, Michael started him\r\nafresh, he paid off a million of debts and built up another fortune.\r\nMichael, several times a millionaire, has studied the swine as Sir John\r\nLubbock has studied the ant. No part of the hog is wasted under his\r\ntrained system, but thus far the Cudahys have not been able to hog the\r\nHoosier oil-fields.\r\n\r\nC. H. Shattuck had the first well in West Virginia drilled for oil. He\r\ncame from Michigan in the fall of 1859, secured land in Wirt county and\r\nbored one-hundred feet by the tedious spring-pole process. The well was\r\non the bank of the Hughes river, from which the natives skimmed off a\r\ngreasy fluid to use for rheumatism and bruises. It was dry and Shattuck\r\nsettled at Parkersburg, his present abode. At Burning Springs a\r\n“disagreeable fluid” flooded a salt-well, which the owner quit in\r\ndisgust. General Samuel Karns, of Pennsylvania, and his nephew, S. D.\r\nKarns, rigged it up in 1860 and pumped considerable oil. The shallow\r\nterritory was operated extensively. Ford & Hanlon bored on Oil-Spring\r\nRun, Ritchie county, in 1861-2, finding heavy oil in paying quantities.\r\nW. H. Moore started the phenomenal eruption at Volcano in 1863, by\r\ndrilling the first well, which produced eight-thousand barrels of\r\nlubricating oil. Sheafer & Steen’s, the second well, was a good second\r\nand the Cornfield pumped seven-thousand barrels of thirty-five-gravity\r\noil in six months. William C. Stiles and the Oil-Run Petroleum Company\r\npunched scores of wells. Volcano perched on the lubricating pedestal for\r\nyears, but it is now extinct. E. L. Gale—he built the railroad\r\nfreight-houses at Aspinwall and Panama and owned the site of Joliet and\r\nhalf the land on which Milwaukee thrives—in 1854 purchased two-thousand\r\nacres of bush twenty-five miles from Parkersburg. In 1866 the celebrated\r\nShaw well, the first of any note on his tract, flowed one-hundred\r\nbarrels of twenty-six-degree oil. Gale sent samples to the Paris\r\nExposition in 1867 and received the only gold-medal awarded for natural\r\noils. The Shaw well kicked up a fuss, leases brought large bonuses,\r\nexcitement ran high and the “Gale Oil Field” was king of the hour.\r\nLand-grabbers annoyed Gale, who declined a million dollars for his\r\nproperty. He routed the herd and died at an advanced age, leaving his\r\nheirs ample means to weather the severest financial gale. The war had\r\ndriven northern operators from the field and heavy-oil developments\r\ncleared the coast for the next act on the program.\r\n\r\nCharles B. Traverneir, in the spring of 1883, on Rock Run, put down the\r\nfirst deep well in West Virginia. It encountered a strong flow of oil at\r\ntwenty-one-hundred feet and yielded for eleven years. Volcano and\r\nParkersburg had retired and light-oil territory was the object of the\r\nambitious wildcatter. At Eureka, situated in a plain contiguous to the\r\nOhio river, Brown & Rose struck the third sand in April, 1886, at\r\nthirteen-hundred feet. The well flowed seven-hundred barrels of\r\nforty-four-gravity oil, similar to the Macksburg variety and equal to\r\nthe Pennsylvania article for refining. The derrick burned, with the\r\ntools at the bottom of the well, and the yield decreased to\r\nthree-hundred barrels in May. Oilmen pronounced Eureka the coming\r\noil-town and farmers asked ridiculous prices for their lands. Bradford\r\nparties leased numerous tracts and bounced the drill merrily. The third\r\nsand in West Virginia was found in what are known as “oil breaks,” at\r\nirregular depths and sometimes cropping out upon the surface. Eureka is\r\nstill a center of activity. The surrounding country resembles the\r\nWashington district in appearance and fertility of the soil. In 1891\r\nThomas Mills, who operated at Tionesta in 1862 and at Macksburg in\r\n1883-4, leased a bundle of lands near Sistersville and sank a well\r\nsixteen-hundred feet. A glut of salt-water induced him to sell out\r\ncheap. The first important results were obtained on the Ohio side of the\r\nOhio river, where many wells were bored. The Polecat well, drilled in\r\n1890, daily pumped fifty barrels of oil and two-thousand of salt-water,\r\nbringing Sistersville forward a peg. Eight wells produced a thousand\r\nbarrels of green oil per day in May of 1892. Operating was costly and\r\nonly wealthy individuals or companies could afford to take the risks of\r\nopening such a field. Captain J. T. Jones, J. M. Guffey, Murphy &\r\nJennings, the Carter Oil-Company, the Devonian Oil-Company, the Forest\r\nOil-Company and the South-Penn have reduced the business to an exact\r\nscience and secured a large production. Sistersville, named from the two\r\nWelles sisters, who once owned the site of the town, has been a magnet\r\nto petroleumites for two years. Gushers worthy of Butler or Allegheny\r\nhave been let loose in Tyler, Wood, Ritchie, Marion and Doddridge. The\r\nBig Moses, on Indian Creek, is a first-class gasser. Morgantown,\r\nMannington and Sistersville are as familiar names as McDonald,\r\nMillerstown or Parker. Pipe-lines handle the product and old-timers from\r\nBradford, Warren and Petrolia are seen at every turn. West-Virginia is\r\non top for the moment, with the tendency southward and operators eagerly\r\nseeking more petroleum-worlds to conquer in Kentucky and Tennessee.\r\n\r\nShe was a radiant Sistersville girl. She descended the stairs quietly\r\nand laid her hand on the knob of the door, hoping to steal out\r\nstealthily in the gray dawn. Her father stood in the porch and she was\r\ndiscovered. “My daughter,” said the white-haired old gentleman, “what is\r\nthat—what are those you have on?” She hung her head and turned the\r\ndoor-knob uneasily back and forth between her fingers, but did not\r\nanswer. “Did you not promise me,” the old man went on, “that if I bought\r\nyou a bicycle you would not wear—that is, you would ride in skirts?” She\r\nstepped impulsively toward him and paused. “Yes, father,” she said, “I\r\ndid and I meant it. But I didn’t know these then. The more I saw of them\r\nthe better I liked them. They improve on acquaintance, father. They grow\r\non one——” “My daughter,” he interrupted, “Eve’s garments grew on her!”\r\nAnd so it has been with the West-Virginia oil-field—it grows on one and\r\nthe more he sees of it the better he likes it.\r\n\r\nLong after the Ruffners’ time Tyler county, the heart of the\r\nWest-Virginia region, was a backwoods district, two generations behind\r\nthe age and traveling at an ice-wagon gait, until it caught “the glow of\r\nthe light to come.” Its beginning was small, but men who sneer at little\r\nthings merely show that they have sat on a tack and been worsted in the\r\nfray. It has taken grit and perseverance to bring a hundred-thousand\r\nbarrels of oil a day from the bowels of the earth in Pennsylvania, Ohio,\r\nWest-Virginia and Indiana. The man who has not a liberal stock of these\r\nqualities should steep himself in brine before engaging in\r\noil-operations. He will only hit the nail on the thumb and be as badly\r\nfooled as the chump who deems he has a cinch on heaven because he never\r\nstole sheep. Petroleum is all right and a long way from its ninth\r\ninning. The alarmist who thinks it is playing out would have awakened\r\nNoah with the cry of “Fire!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIG MOSES GAS-WELL IN WEST VIRGINIA.]\r\n\r\nEdward H. Jennings is among the most enterprising and fortunate\r\noperators in West Virginia. His Kanawha Oil Company has a legion of\r\ntip-top wells and miles of approved territory. Like his deceased father,\r\na pioneer in Armstrong and Butler, he decides promptly and acts\r\nvigorously. With James M. Guffey, John H. Galey and one or two others he\r\nowned the phenomenal Matthews well and the richest territory at\r\nMcDonald. The same gentlemen now own the famous Trade-Dollar Mine in\r\nIdaho, the greatest silver-mine on earth to-day, and gold-mines in\r\nCalifornia, Colorado and Nova Scotia that yield bountiful returns. Mr.\r\nJennings is president of the Columbia Bank and lives in the beautiful\r\nEast End of Pittsburg. He ranks high in business and finance. Brainy,\r\ncultured, energetic and courageous, Mr. Jennings scored his mark through\r\nwell-directed effort and systematic industry\r\n\r\nWomanly intuition is a hummer that discounts science, philosophy and\r\nred-tape. Mrs. Katherine E. Reed died at Sistersville in June of 1896.\r\nHer foresight secured fortunes for herself and many other in Tyler\r\ncounty. Left a widow five years ago, with eight children and a farm that\r\nwould starve goats to death, she leased the land for oil-purposes. The\r\ntest-well proving dry, Mrs. Reed implored the men to try again at a spot\r\nshe had proposed for the first venture. The drillers were hard up, but\r\nconsented to make a second trial when the good woman agreed to board\r\nthem for nothing in case no oil was found. The well was the biggest\r\ngusher in the bundle. To-day it is producing largely and is known oil\r\nover West Virginia as “The Big Kate.” Mrs. Reed cleared\r\ntwo-hundred-thousand dollars from the sterile tract, which would sell\r\nfor as much more yet, and her children and neighbors are independent for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nDo any of the Pioneers on Kanawha remember “Dick” Timms’s Half-way\r\nHouse? The weather-beaten sign bore the legend, in faded letters: “Rest\r\nfor the Weary. R. Timms.” The exterior was rough and unpainted, but\r\ninside was cheery and homelike in its snugness. When travelers rode up\r\nto the door “Uncle Dick,” in full uniform of shirt and pantaloons,\r\nbarefooted and hatless, rough and uncouth in speech and appearance, but\r\nwith a heart so big that it made his fat body bulge and his whole face\r\nlight up with a cheerful smile, stood ready with his welcome salutation\r\nof “Howdy, howdy? ’Light; come in.”\r\n\r\nColorado counts confidently upon a production sufficient to give the\r\nCentennial State a solid lodgment in the petroleum-column. Its earliest\r\ndevelopment was a small well on the Lobach ranch, near Florence, in\r\n1882. Other wells yielded enough crude to warrant the erection of a\r\nrefinery in 1885, by the Arkansas-Valley Oil-Company, to which the\r\nUnited Oil-Company has succeeded. The United pumps ten or twelve-hundred\r\nbarrels a day from forty wells, refining the product into illuminating\r\noils, gasoline and lubricants of superior quality. The Florence\r\nOil-Company pumps a dozen wells, owns a little refinery and holds large\r\nblocks of leased lands. The Rocky-Mountain Oil-Company, organized in\r\n1890, has drilled forty-five wells south of the town of Florence,\r\ntwenty-four of which yield three-hundred barrels a day. The Eureka\r\nCompany is also operating briskly. The production of the Colorado region\r\nis nearly two-thousand barrels a day, derived from wells that average\r\ntwenty-five hundred feet in depth, too expensive for persons of slender\r\nmeans to tamper with.\r\n\r\n             The lively folks who drill in Colorado\r\n             May justly be excused for some bravado,\r\n             Because their hopes are not based on a shadow.\r\n\r\nThe Salt-Creek oil-field, the first worked in Wyoming, is in the\r\nnorthern part of Natrona and the southern part of Johnson county, fifty\r\nmiles north of Caspar, the terminus of the Fremont, Elkhorn &\r\nMissouri-Valley Railroad. As known to-day the field is eighteen by\r\nthirty miles. It lies along Salt Creek and its tributaries, which drain\r\nnorthward and empty into Powder River, and is a rough country, cut by\r\ndeep gulches, beneath which there are table-lands of small extent.\r\nVegetation is scanty and timber is found only on the highest bluffs. In\r\n1889 the Pennsylvania Oil-Company, composed of Pennsylvanians and under\r\nthe management of George B. McCalmont, located on Salt Creek and drilled\r\na well which, early in the spring of 1890, struck oil. Obstacles of no\r\nsmall magnitude were met with. The oil had to be freighted fifty miles\r\nby wagon; railroad-freights were controlled by eastern oil producers,\r\nrates that would justify shipments seemed almost impossible, and the oil\r\nhad to be proved before it could be placed upon the market in\r\ncompetition with well-known brands. In the face of these difficulties\r\nthe company continued work, and in the spring of 1894 succeeded in\r\nmaking arrangements to ship crude-oil. Storage-tanks were erected at the\r\nwells and at the railroad, and a refinery is now in operation at Caspar.\r\nThe wells vary in depth from nine-hundred to fifteen-hundred feet and\r\nthree companies are operating. The oil is a valuable lubricant. The\r\ntransportation of the oil to the railroad is effected by freight-wagons\r\nof the ordinary sort. Behind them is a fourth wagon, or the freighter’s\r\nhome, which has wide boards projecting from the sides of the wagon-box\r\nover the wheels, making a box of unusual width covered with heavy canvas\r\nover the ordinary wagon-bows and provided with a window in the back, a\r\ndoor in front, a bed, cook-stove, table, cupboard and the necessary\r\nequipment for keeping house. In this house on wheels the freighter\r\npasses the night, and in breaking camp he is not bothered with his\r\ncamp-outfit. This novelty has been recently introduced by Mr. Johnson,\r\nthe leading freighter for the Pennsylvania Company. With sixteen mules\r\nhe draws his four wagons with nine tons of oil, over a very sandy road.\r\n\r\nWyoming oil sells high at Caspar, which is becoming a place of some\r\nconsequence and may soon figure as the state-metropolis. It was a fort\r\nin the days of wild beasts and wilder Indians. Soft rock, with a\r\nprovoking tendency to cave-in, and artesian water, impregnated with\r\nsulphur and found just above the oil-sand, rendered drilling a difficult\r\ntask. The best well in the bunch produces from a rock five-hundred feet\r\ndown, while the deepest is sixteen-hundred feet and the sand is fifty\r\nfeet thick. Oil-basins on Caspar Creek, Powder River, Salt Creek and\r\nPoison Spider indicate the existence of petroleum over a wide section of\r\nthe state. Wells on Salt Creek resemble those in Russia. True-blue\r\nWyomingites proudly anticipate the day when their gilt-edged basin will\r\nhit the Baku mastodons a Fitzsimmons sock-dolager in the solar-plexus.\r\n\r\n              My! Won’t the Czar feel like the deuceovitch\r\n              When the Wyoming wells cut looseovitch\r\n              And Baku spouters must vamooseovitch?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWELVE HORSES AND THREE WAGONS FOR HAULING OIL, AT\r\nCASPAR, WYOMING, WITH “BARNEY” M’CALMONT IN THE FOREGROUND.]\r\n\r\nWilliam M. Mills, boring for gas in 1892 near the east side of Neodesha,\r\nWilson county, Kansas, found sand with oil in two wells and plugged the\r\nholes. John H. Galey, ever awake to the importance of prospective\r\nterritory, heard the news and proceeded to investigate. He examined the\r\nsand and the oil—almost black in color and of heavy gravity—thought\r\nfavorably of the country, enlisted Mills for the campaign, leased\r\nsixty-thousand acres for himself and James M. Guffey, located a number\r\nof wells and prepared for extensive developments. Guffey & Galey’s first\r\nwell was rather slim. Their second, at Thayer, fourteen miles\r\nnorth-east, was also small. Their third, twenty-five miles farther\r\nnorth-east, at Humbolt, Allen county, had sand and gas and a feeble show\r\nof oil. Similar results forty miles south-west of Neodesha confirmed\r\ntheir opinion of plenty spotted territory to be worth testing to a\r\nfinish. They drilled twenty wells in the vicinity of Neodesha, the\r\nmajority of them fair. Several out of eighteen put down around Thayer,\r\nin the winter of 1893-4, rated in the medium class. The principal\r\nproduction of the Kansas field to-day—about five-hundred barrels derived\r\nfrom a hundred or more wells—is at these two points. In all Guffey &\r\nGaley drilled one-hundred-and-forty wells, averaging eight-hundred feet\r\ndeep and half of them dry, and sold to the Forest Oil-Company in 1895.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE OIL IS SOUGHT IN KANSAS.]\r\n\r\nE. E. Crocker, son of the Bradford pioneer, superintended the drilling\r\nof numerous wells for the Forest in 1896-7. Scattered over Bourbon,\r\nCrawford, Allen, Neosho, Woodson, Elk, Wilson and Montgomery counties,\r\ntwo-thirds of these ventures were dusters. Three at Humboldt are the\r\nfarthest north that produce any oil. The farthest south are near Sedan\r\nand Peru, Chautauqua county. This embraces about seventy-five miles\r\nnorth-east and south-west. The whole district is as uncertain as the age\r\nof the oldest Betsey Bobbet in the pack. Dry-holes may surround a fair\r\nstrike. The sand runs from eight to twenty feet. The oil is extremely\r\ndark, twenty to thirty-five gravity, with asphalt base, no paraffine and\r\nno sulphur. From the company’s refinery at Neodesha, which has a\r\ncapacity of one-thousand barrels, the first shipment of kerosene was\r\nmade last June. The refinery is designed to supply Kansas and portions\r\nof Nebraska and Missouri. Most of the crude is produced so near the\r\nrefinery that pipe-lines have not been laid to transport it.\r\n\r\nGas is struck ninety to a hundred feet below the oil-sand, sometimes in\r\nlarge quantity and occasionally at about four-hundred feet from the\r\nsurface. Low pressure and water prevent piping gas in the shallow wells\r\nlong distances. It was a Fourth of July when the vapor illuminant was\r\nfirst lighted at Neodesha. Enthusiasm and patriotism drew thousands to\r\nthe celebration. Jerry Simpson’s candidacy and Peffer’s whiskers were\r\nside-tracked and forgotten. Darkness gathered and the impatient throng\r\nwaited for the torch to be applied to the tall stand-pipes. Their cheers\r\nmight be heard in Oklahoma when masses of flame lit up the sky and\r\nbathed the town in a lurid glare.\r\n\r\nThe Guiper Oil-Company, managed by William Guiper of Oil City, the\r\nPalmer Oil-Company and James Amm & Co. have drilled many wells that did\r\nnot bear the market a little bit. Across the Kansas border, at Eufala,\r\nIndian Territory, the Enterprise Oil-Company bored twenty-eight-hundred\r\nfeet without finding the stuff. Two wells in Creek county had white-sand\r\nand a trifle of amber-oil at seven-hundred and a thousand feet. The\r\nCherokee Oil-Company drilled ten wells that produced a moderate amount\r\nof heavy-oil from two slates. Wisconsin parties, making deep tests on\r\nthe Cherokee border, indulge in fond hopes that “Bleeding Kansas” and\r\nthe country south may shortly bleed petroleum from a half-score rich\r\narteries.\r\n\r\nFive wells near Litchfield, Illinois, pump fifty gallons of\r\nlubricating-oil a day. Two in Bates county, Missouri, dribble enough to\r\ngrease wagon-axles and farm-implements. A New-York syndicate has\r\nobtained large concessions of land from the government and is drilling\r\nat Jalapa, Mexico, where oil was found in shallow wells a few years ago.\r\nIn Kentucky a host of small or dry wells have gone down since 1894. The\r\nBobs-Bar well, the only one producing in Tennessee, drilled in 1896,\r\nflowed fifty barrels an hour, caught fire the first night and afterwards\r\npumped sixty barrels a day for a season.\r\n\r\nBelieving an artesian-well would supply the community with abundant pure\r\nwater, a local company at Corsicana, Navarro county, Texas, three years\r\nago started the tools to pierce the “joint clay” in the south-west end\r\nof town. Sixteen years before a well drilled nine-hundred feet failed to\r\naccomplish this purpose and was filled up. Geologists gravely announced\r\nthat water—unfit to use at that—could not be had within\r\nthirty-five-hundred feet. The company kept right along. At ten-hundred\r\nfeet the clay ceased and twenty feet of sandy shale, soft and bluish,\r\nfollowed. Oil, real petroleum, hardly inferior to the best in\r\nPennsylvania, flowed strongly. Doubting Thomases felt sure this\r\nunexpected glut of oil settled the water-question in the negative and\r\nadvised tubing the well. The company cased off the oil, resumed\r\ndrilling, pierced five-hundred feet more of “joint clay,” four-hundred\r\nfeet of “Dallas chalk” and another immense layer of clay. At twenty-five\r\nhundred feet a crystal current of water gushed forth to the rhythm of\r\nfifteen-thousand gallons an hour. The water-problem was solved happily,\r\nthe company was amply vindicated and the Corsicanans were\r\ncorrespondingly jubilant. The geological freaks were confounded. Of\r\ncourse, they knew more about the creation than Moses and could upset\r\nGenesis in one round, but a six-inch hole on their own ground put them\r\nfloundering in the soup.\r\n\r\nJohn H. Galey read a brief report of the water-well and visited\r\nCorsicana “on the quiet.” He had cart-loads of experience in oil-matters\r\nand a faculty for opening new fields. He drilled on Oil Creek in the\r\nsixties, had a hand in the Pithole pie, broadened the Pleasantville\r\nlimit, set the Parker district going, went to the front in Butler and\r\nlet no patch of creamy territory escape his vigilant eye. In Kansas he\r\nhad located and drilled the first wells—at Neodesha and Thayer—that\r\nbrought into play the only pools that have paid their way. He spent a\r\nyear in Texas picking up lands and putting down wells. As in Kansas, his\r\nfirst and second wells were ten or twelve miles apart and both touched\r\nthe jugular. He sold his entire interest, four companies entered the\r\nfield and thirty wells are doing a thousand barrels a day. The first car\r\nof Corsicana oil was shipped last July, amid the huzzas of a crowd of\r\ncheering citizens. Senator Roger Q. Mills, the Democratic statesman, is\r\nthe lucky owner of a thousand acres of land on the outskirts of town.\r\nThe property has been leased and it bids fair to make the Senator a\r\nmillionaire. Petroleum may yet be the brightest star in the\r\nconstellation of the Lone-Star State.\r\n\r\nCalifornia is not content to have gold-mines, overgrown trees and\r\ntropical fruits and leave petroleum out in the cold. For years\r\ndevelopments have been carried on, centering finally at Los Angeles.\r\nCity-lots are punctured with holes and three-hundred wells have been\r\ndrilled on two-hundred acres. Samuel M. Jones, formerly of the\r\nPennsylvania oil-region and now president of the Acme Sucker-Rod-Company\r\nof Toledo, leveled his kodak at the Los-Angeles wells in 1895, securing\r\nthe view printed in the cut. Hon. W. L. Hardison, who operated in the\r\nClarion and Bradford fields and served a couple of terms in the\r\nLegislature, and Lyman Stewart, of Titusville, have been largely\r\ninterested in the California field for ten years. Los-Angeles wells are\r\nseven to nine-hundred feet deep, yield six barrels to seventy-five at\r\nthe start and employ six-hundred men. The oil is used for fuel and\r\nlubrication, produces superior asphaltum and a distillate for\r\nstove-burners and gasoline-engines. It cannot be refined profitably for\r\nilluminating. The Los-Angeles field, about one mile long and six-hundred\r\nfeet wide, had a small beginning. The first wells, near the\r\nSecond-Street Park, were small, only to the first sand—four-hundred\r\nfeet—and yielded poorly. The operators lacked knowledge and bunched the\r\nholes as closely as sardines in a box. Deeper drilling revealed richer\r\nstrata, from which four-hundred wells are producing eighteen-hundred\r\nbarrels a day. Railways, electric lines and manufacturing establishments\r\nconsume the bulk of the output—equivalent to seven-hundred tons of coal\r\ndaily—for fuel. The best wells have been pumping twenty months to two\r\nyears, a few starting at three-hundred barrels for a week.\r\nTwenty-five-hundred dollars is the average cost of a California well and\r\nthe total yield of the district approximates two-million barrels up to\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OIL-WELLS AT LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.]\r\n\r\nLos Angeles is a genuine California town, with oil-wells as an extra\r\nfeature. Derricks cluster on Belmont Hill, State street, Lakeshore\r\navenue, Second street, and leading thoroughfares. A six-inch line\r\nconveys crude to the railroads and car-tanks are shipped over the\r\nSouthern Pacific and Santa Fé routes. At least one of the preachers\r\nseems to be drilling “on the belt,” if a tourist’s tale of a prayer he\r\noffered be true. Here it is:\r\n\r\n“O, Lord! we pray that the excursion train going east this morning may\r\nnot run off the track and kill any church-members that may be on board.\r\nThou knowest it is bad enough to run oil-wells on Sunday, but worse to\r\nrun Sunday excursions. Church-members on Sunday excursions are not in\r\ncondition to die. In addition to this, it is embarrassing to a minister\r\nto officiate at a funeral of a member of the church who has been killed\r\non a Sunday excursion. Keep the train on the track and preserve it from\r\nany calamity, that all church-members among the excursionists may have\r\nopportunity for repentance, that their sins may be forgiven. We ask it\r\nfor Christ’s sake. Amen.”\r\n\r\nWith juicy Ohio, plump West Virginia, nutritious Indiana, succulent\r\nCalifornia, appetizing Texas and many other luscious bivalves to keep\r\nfat Pennsylvania company, there is no lack of oysters in the stew.\r\n\r\n                           SOME OF THE BOYS.\r\n\r\nMichael Murphy, of “mystery” fame, lives in Chester county.\r\n\r\nWilliam L. Lay, founder of South Oil-City, died last winter.\r\n\r\nW. J. Welch, a respected citizen, who operated at Bullion and Bradford\r\nand for years belonged to the Oil-City Exchange, died in 1897.\r\n\r\nRuel A. Watson, an active broker, as he lay gasping for breath, raised\r\nhis head, asked an attendant “What’s the market?” sank back on his\r\npillow and expired. “The ruling passion is strong in death.”\r\n\r\nJohn Vanausdall, partner of William Phillips in the biggest well on Oil\r\nCreek, left his home at Oil City in the morning, took ill at Petrolia\r\nand telegraphed for his wife. She reached his bedside just as he drew\r\nhis last breath.\r\n\r\n                A man may seem to be a bang-up seraph,\r\n                Yet be a proper subject for the sheriff.\r\n\r\nJohn Wallace, an early oil-operator at Rouseville and merchant at Rynd,\r\ndied in 1880. Born in Great Britain, he served in the English army,\r\nparticipated in the Crimean war and was one of the “Gallant Six Hundred”\r\nin the desperate charge at Balaklava immortalized by Tennyson.\r\n\r\nThe late H. L. McCance, long secretary of the Oil-City Exchange, was the\r\nThomas Nast of Oildom. Two of his cartoons—“When Oil is Seventy Cents”\r\nand “When Oil is Three Dollars”—in this volume and those exposing the\r\nSouth-Improvement infamy were especially striking.\r\n\r\nB. D. J. McKeown is probably the only millionaire ball-player in the\r\nUnited States. He belongs to the Washington team, which is a member of\r\nthe Pennsylvania State-League, and has played first base with the nine\r\nthe entire season. He is a son of the late John McKeown, a keen man of\r\naffairs, a clean fielder, heavy batter and swift base-runner.\r\n\r\n              Many a chap who thinks he’s sure of Heaven,\r\n              But in his make-up lacks the kindly leaven,\r\n              Will find Old Nick on hand with a replevin.\r\n\r\nCol. W. H. Kinter, of Oil City, a man of kindliest impulses, genial and\r\nwhole-souled, greeting a neighbor one Sunday evening, remarked:\r\n“Goodnight, old boy—no, make it good-bye; we may never meet again!” He\r\nretired in excellent health and spirits. Next morning, feeling drowsy,\r\nhe asked his wife—a daughter of Hamilton McClintock—to bring him a cup\r\nof tea. She returned in a short time to find her husband asleep in\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe irrepressible “Sam” Blakely originated the term “shuffle,” which he\r\noften practiced in his dealings in the oil-exchanges, and the phrase,\r\n“Boys, don’t take off your shirts!” This expression spread far and wide\r\nand was actually repeated by Osman Pasha—if the cablegrams told the\r\ntruth—at the battle of Plevna, when his troops wavered an instant in the\r\nface of a dreadful rain of bullets. “Sam” also inaugurated the custom of\r\ndrinking Rhine-wine. Once he constituted himself a committee of one to\r\ncelebrate the Fourth of July at Parker. He printed a great lot of\r\nposters, which announced a celebration on a gorgeous scale—horse-races,\r\nclimbing the greased pole, boat-races, orations, fireworks and other\r\nattractions. These were posted about the city and on barns and fences\r\nwithin a radius of ten miles. A friend asked him how his celebration was\r\nlikely to come off. “Oh,” he said, “we’re going to get all the hayseeds\r\nin here and then we’ll give them the great kibosh.” On the glorious day\r\n“Sam” mounted a box in front of the Columbia hose-house and delivered an\r\noration before four-thousand people, who pronounced it the funniest\r\nthing they ever heard and accepted the situation good-naturedly. Some\r\nimpromptu games were got up and the day passed off pleasantly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POND-FRESHET AT OIL CITY, MARCH, 1863.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XV.\r\n                       FROM THE WELL TO THE LAMP.\r\n\r\nTRANSPORTING CRUDE-OIL BY WAGONS AND BOATS—UNFATHOMABLE MUD\r\n    AND SWEARING TEAMSTERS—POND FRESHETS—ESTABLISHMENT OF\r\n    PIPE-LINES—NATIONAL-TRANSIT COMPANY AND SOME OF ITS\r\n    OFFICERS—SPECULATION IN CERTIFICATES—EXCHANGES AT PROMINENT\r\n    POINTS—THE PRODUCT THAT ILLUMINES THE WORLD AT VARIOUS STAGES OF\r\n    PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n                               ----------\r\n\r\n“Lamps were gleaming everywhere, gleaming from huge banks of\r\n    flowers.”—_Wilson Barrett._\r\n\r\n“Nature must give way to Art.”—_Jonathan Swift._\r\n\r\n“The flighty purpose never is o’ertook, unless the deed go with\r\n    it.”—_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n“My kingdom for a horse to haul my oil.”—_Richard III.

Oil might flow or be pumped readily, but it could\r\nneither transport nor sell itself. Crude in the tank was not always\r\nmoney in the purse without a good deal of engineering. The Irishman’s\r\ncontrary pig, which he headed for Cork to drive to Dublin, was much less\r\ntrouble to raise than to get to market. The first wells on Oil Creek\r\nwere so close to the water that the stuff could be loaded directly into\r\ncanoes or dug-outs and floated to the mouth of the stream. This\r\narrangement, despite its apparent convenience, had serious drawbacks.\r\nThe creek was too low in dry weather for navigation, except possibly by\r\nthe Mississippi craft that slipped along easily on the morning dew. To\r\novercome this difficulty recourse was had to artificial methods when the\r\nproduction increased sufficiently to introduce flat-boats, which\r\ndispensed with barrels and freighted the oil in bulk. The system of\r\npond-freshets was adopted. A dam at the saw-mill near the Drake well\r\nstored the fluid until the time agreed upon to open the gates and let\r\nthe imprisoned waters escape. Rev. A. L. Dubbs was appointed\r\nsuperintendent and shippers were assessed for the use of the water\r\nstored in the pond. Usually two-hundred to eight-hundred boats—boats of\r\nall shapes and sizes, from square-keeled barges, divided into\r\ncompartments by cross-partitions, to slim-pointed guipers—were pulled up\r\nthe stream by horses once or twice a week to be filled at the wells and\r\nawait the rushing waters. Expert rivermen, accustomed to dodging snags\r\nand rocks in inland streams, managed the fleet. These skilled pilots\r\nassumed the responsibility of delivering the oil to the larger boats at\r\nOil City, for conveyance to Pittsburg, at one-hundred to two-hundred\r\ndollars per trip.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOW OIL IS TRANSPORTED IN RUSSIA—HAULING EMPTY BARRELS.]\r\n\r\nAt the appointed moment the flood-gates were opened and the water rushed\r\nforth, increasing the depth of the creek two or three feet. The boatmen\r\nstood by their lines, to cast loose when the current was precisely\r\nright. Sound judgment was required. The loaded boat, if let go too soon,\r\nran the risk of grounding in the first shallow-place, to be battered\r\ninto kindling-wood by those coming after. Such accidents occurred\r\nfrequently, resulting in a general jam and loss of vessels and cargoes.\r\nThe scene was more exciting than a three-ringed circus. Property and\r\nlife were imperiled, boats were ground to fragments, thousands of\r\nbarrels of oil were spilled and the tangle seemed inextricable. Men,\r\nwomen and children lined the banks of the stream for miles, intently\r\nwatching the spectacle. Persons of all nationalities, kindreds and\r\nconditions vociferated in their diversified jargon, producing a\r\nconfusion of tongues that outbabeled Babel three to one. Men of wealth\r\nand refinement, bespattered and besmeared with crude—their trousers\r\ntucked into boots reaching above the knee, and most likely wearing at\r\nthe same time a nobby necktie—might be seen boarding the boats with the\r\nagility of a cat and the courage of warriors, shouting, managing,\r\ndirecting and leading in the perilous work of safe exit. Sunday creeds\r\nwere forgotten and the third commandment, constantly snapped in twain,\r\ngave emphasis to the crashing hulks and barrels. A pillar of the\r\nPresbyterian church, seeing his barge unmanned, ran screaming at the top\r\nof his voice: “Where in sheol is Parker?” This so amused his good\r\nbrethren that they used it as a by-word for months.\r\n\r\nThe cry of “Pond Freshet” would bring the entire population of Oil City\r\nto witness the arrival of the boats. Sometimes the tidal wave would\r\nforce them on a sand-bar in the Allegheny, smashing and crushing them\r\nlike egg-shells. Oil from overturned or demolished boats belonged to\r\nwhoever chose to dip it up. More than one solid citizen got his start on\r\nfortune’s road by dipping oil in this way. If the voyage ended safely\r\nthe oil was transferred from the guipers—fifty barrels each—and small\r\nboats to larger ones for shipment to Pittsburg. William Phillips,\r\njoint-owner of the biggest well on Oil Creek, was the first man to take\r\na cargo of crude in bulk to the Smoky City. The pond-freshet was a great\r\ninstitution in its day, with romantic features that would enrapture an\r\nartist and tickle lovers of sensation to the fifth rib. One night the\r\nlantern of a careless workman set fire to the oil in one of the boats.\r\nOthers caught and were cut loose to drift down the river, floating up\r\nagainst a pier and burning the bridge at Franklin. Running the “rapids”\r\non the St. Lawrence river or the “Long Sault” on the Ottawa was not half\r\nso thrilling and hair-raising as a fleet of oil-boats in a crush at the\r\nmouth of Oil Creek.\r\n\r\nThe fleet of creek and river-boats engaged in this novel traffic\r\nnumbered two-thousand craft. The “guiper,” scow-shaped and holding\r\ntwenty-five to fifty barrels, was the smallest. The “French Creekers”\r\nheld ten to twelve-hundred barrels and were arranged to carry oil in\r\nbulk or barrels. At first the crude was run into open boats, which a\r\nslight motion of the water would sometimes capsize and spill the cargo\r\ninto the stream. When prices ruled low oil was shipped in bulk; when\r\nhigh, shippers used barrels to lessen the danger of loss. Thousands of\r\nempty barrels, lashed together like logs in a raft, were floated from\r\nOlean. The rate from the more distant wells to Oil City was one-dollar a\r\nbarrel. From Oil City to Pittsburg it varied from twenty-five cents to\r\nthree dollars, according to the weather, the stage of water or the\r\nactivity of the demand. Each pond-freshet cost two or three-hundred\r\ndollars, paid to the mill-owners for storing the water and the use of\r\ntheir dams. Twice a week—Wednesday and Saturday—was the average at the\r\nbusy season. The flood of petroleum from flowing-wells in 1862 exceeded\r\nthe facilities for storing, transporting, refining and burning the oil,\r\nwhich dropped to ten cents a barrel during the summer. Thousands of\r\nbarrels ran into Oil Creek. Pittsburg was the chief market for crude,\r\nwhich was transferred at Oil City to the larger boats. The steamer-fleet\r\nof tow-boats—it exceeded twenty—brought the empties back to Oil City.\r\nThe “Echo,” Captain Ezekiel Gordon; the “Allegheny Belle No. 4,” Captain\r\nJohn Hanna; the “Leclaire,” Captain Kelly; the “Ida Rees,” Captain Rees,\r\nand the “Venango” were favorite passenger-steamers. The trip from\r\nPittsburg—one-hundred-and-thirty-three miles—generally required thirty\r\nto thirty-six hours. Mattresses on the cabin-floor served as beds for\r\nthirty or forty male passengers, who did not undress and rose early that\r\nthe tables might be set for breakfast. The same tables were utilized\r\nbetween meals and in the evening for poker-games. The busiest man on the\r\nboat was the bar-tender and the clerk was the most important. He carried\r\nletters and money for leading oil-shippers. It was not uncommon for\r\nAlfred Russell, of the “Echo,” John Thompson, of the “Belle No. 4,” and\r\nRuse Russ, of the “Venango,” to walk into Hanna’s or Abrams’s\r\nwarehouse-office with large packages of money for John J. Fisher,\r\nWilliam Lecky, John Mawhinney, William Thompson and others who bought\r\noil. No receipts were given or taken and, notwithstanding the apparent\r\nlooseness in doing business, no package was ever lost or stolen. The\r\nboats usually landed at the lower part of the eddy to put off passengers\r\nwishing to stop at the Moran and Parker Hotels. At Hanna & Co.’s and\r\nAbrams & Co.’s landing, where the northern approach of the suspension\r\nbridge now is, they put off the remaining passengers, freight and empty\r\noil-barrels. Many a Christian-looking man was heard to swear as he left\r\nthe gang-plank of the boat and struck the mud, tough and greasy and\r\ndeep. He would soon tumble to the situation, roll up his trousers and\r\n“pull for the shore.”\r\n\r\nHorses and mules dragged the empty boats up Oil Creek, a terrible task\r\nin cold weather. Slush or ice and floating oil shaved the hair off the\r\npoor animals as if done with a razor. The treatment of the patient\r\ncreatures—thousands were literally murdered—was frightful and few\r\nsurvived. For them the plea of inability availed nothing. They were\r\nworked until they dropped dead. The finest mule, ears very long, coat\r\nshiny, tail vehement, eye mischievous, heels vigorous and bray distinct\r\nand melodious, quickly succumbed to the freezing water and harsh usage.\r\nAs a single trip realized more than would buy another the brutal driver\r\nscarcely felt the financial loss. A story is told of a boatman who\r\nstarted in the morning for the wells to bring down a load of oil.\r\nReturning in the evening, he learned that he had been drafted into the\r\narmy. Before retiring to bed he had hired a substitute for one-thousand\r\ndollars, the proceeds of his journey of eleven miles and back. William\r\nHaldeman hauled a man over the coals for beating his exhausted horse,\r\ntold him to buy another and handed him five-hundred dollars for eight\r\nhorses to haul a boat to the gushers at Funkville.\r\n\r\nPond-freshets were holidays in Oil City sufficiently memorable to go\r\ngliding down the ages with the biggest kind of chalk-mark. Young and old\r\nflocked to see the boats slip into the Allegheny, lodge on the\r\ngravel-bar, strike the pier of the bridge or anchor in Moran’s Eddy.\r\nHundreds of boatmen, drillers, pumpers and operators would be on board.\r\nOnce the river had only a foot of water at Scrubgrass Ripple and large\r\nboats could not get to or from Pittsburg. A ship-carpenter came from New\r\nYork to Titusville and spent his last dollar in lumber for six boxes\r\nsixteen feet square and twelve inches deep. He covered them with\r\ninch-boards and divided them into small compartments, to prevent the oil\r\nfrom running from one end to the other and swamping the vessel. This\r\nprinciple was applied to oil-boats thereafter and extended to\r\nbulk-barges and bulk-steamships. The ingenious carpenter floated his\r\nstrange arks down to the Blood farm and bargained with Henry Balliott to\r\nfill them on credit. He performed the voyage safely, returned in due\r\ncourse, paid Balliott, built more boxes and went home in four months\r\nwith a snug fortune. His ship had come in. Railroads and pipe-lines have\r\nrelegated pond-freshets, oil-boats and Allegheny steamers to the rear,\r\nbut they were interesting features of the petroleum-development in early\r\ndays and should not be utterly forgotten.\r\n\r\nTo haul oil from inland wells to shipping-points required thousands of\r\nhorses. This service originated the wagon-train of the oil-country,\r\nwhich at its best consisted of six-thousand two-horse teams and wagons.\r\nNo such transport-service was ever before seen outside of an army on a\r\nmarch. General M. H. Avery, a renowned cavalry-commander during the war,\r\norganized a regular army-train at Pithole. Travelers in the oil-regions\r\nseldom lost sight of these endless trains of wagons bearing their greasy\r\nfreight to the nearest railroad or shipping-point. Five to seven\r\nbarrels—a barrel of oil weighed three-hundred-and-sixty pounds—taxed the\r\nstrength of the stoutest teams. The mud was practically bottomless.\r\nHorses sank to their breasts and wagons far above their axles. Oil\r\ndripping from innumerable barrels mixed with the dirt to keep the mass a\r\nperpetual paste, which destroyed the capillary glands and the hair of\r\nthe animals. Many horses and mules had not a hair below the eyes. A long\r\ncaravan of these hairless beasts gave a spectral aspect to the\r\nlandscape. History records none other such roads. Houses within a\r\nquarter-mile of the roadside were plastered with mud to the eaves. Many\r\na horse fell into the batter and was left to smother. If a wagon broke\r\nthe load was dumped into the mud-canal, or set on the bank to be taken\r\nby whoever thought it worth the labor of stealing. Teamsters would pull\r\ndown fences and drive through fields whenever possible, until the valley\r\nof Oil Creek was an unfathomable quagmire. Think of the bone and sinew\r\nexpended in moving a thousand barrels of oil six or eight miles under\r\nsuch conditions. Two-thirds of the work had to be done in the fall and\r\nwinter, when the elements spared no effort to increase the discomfort\r\nand difficulty of navigation by boat or wagon. To haul oil a half-dozen\r\nmiles cost three to five dollars a barrel at certain periods of the\r\nyear. Thousands of barrels were drawn to Shaw’s Landing, near Meadville,\r\nand thousands to Garland Station and Union City, on the Philadelphia &\r\nErie Railroad. The hauling of a few hundred barrels not infrequently\r\nconsumed so much time that the shipper, in the rapid fluctuations of the\r\nmarket, would not realize enough to pay the wagon-freight. A buyer once\r\npaid ten-thousand dollars for one-thousand barrels at Clapp farm, above\r\nOil City, and four-thousand for teaming it to Franklin, to be shipped by\r\nthe Atlantic & Great Western Railroad to New York. Even after a\r\nplank-road had been built from Titusville to Pithole, cutting down the\r\nteaming one-half or more, the cost of laying down a barrel of crude in\r\nNew York was excessive. In January of 1866 it figured as follows:\r\n\r\n           Government tax                              $1 00\r\n           Barrel                                       3 25\r\n           Teaming from Pithole to Titusville           1 25\r\n           Freight from Titusville to New York          3 65\r\n           Cooperage and platform expenses              1 00\r\n           Leakage                                        25\r\n                                                         ———\r\n           Total                                      $10 40\r\n                                                      ======\r\n\r\nThe Oil Creek teamster, rubber-booted to the waist and flannel-shirted\r\nto the chin, was a picturesque character. He was skilled in profanity\r\nand the savage use of the whip. A week’s earnings—ten, twenty and thirty\r\ndollars a day—he would spend in revelry on Saturday night. Careless of\r\nthe present and heedless of the future, he took life as it came and\r\nwasted no time worrying over consequences. If one horse died he bought\r\nanother. He regulated his charges by the depth and consistency of the\r\nmud and the wear and tear of morality and live-stock. Eventually he\r\nfollowed the flat-boat and barge and guiper to oblivion, railroads and\r\npipe-lines supplanting him as a carrier of oil. Some of the best\r\noperators in the region adopted teaming temporarily, to get a start.\r\nThey saved their money for interests in leases or drilling-wells and not\r\na few went to the front as successful producers. The free-and-easy,\r\ndevil-may-care teamster of yore, brimful of oil and tobacco and not\r\naverse to whiskey, is a tradition, remembered only by men whose polls\r\nare frosting with silver threads that do not stop at sixteen to one.\r\n\r\nWharves, warehouses and landings crowded Oil City from the mouth of Oil\r\nCreek to the Moran House. Barrels filled the warehouse-yards, awaiting\r\ntheir turn to be hauled or boated to the wells, filled with crude and\r\nreturned for shipment. Loaded and empty boats were coming and going\r\ncontinually. Firms and individuals shipped thousands of barrels daily,\r\nemploying a regiment of men and stacks of cash. William M. Lecky, still\r\na respected citizen of Oil City, hustled for R. D. Cochran & Co., whose\r\n“Tiber” was a favorite tow-boat. Parker & Thompson, Fisher Brothers,\r\nMawhinney Brothers and John Munhall & Co. were strong concerns. Their\r\nagents scoured the producing farms to buy oil at the wells and arrange\r\nfor its delivery. Prices fluctuated enormously. Crude bought in\r\nSeptember of 1862 at thirty cents a barrel sold in December at eleven\r\ndollars. John B. Smithman, Munhall’s buyer, walked up the creek one\r\nmorning to buy what he could at three dollars. A dispatch at Rouseville\r\ntold him to pay four, if necessary to secure what the firm desired. At\r\nTarr Farm another message quoted five dollars. By the time he reached\r\nPetroleum Centre the price had reached six dollars and his last\r\npurchases that afternoon were at seven-fifty. Business was done on honor\r\nand every agreement was fulfilled to the letter, whether the price rose\r\nor fell. Lecky, Thomas B. Simpson, W. J. Young and Isaac M. Sowers—he\r\nwas the second mayor of Oil City—clerked in these shipping-offices,\r\nwhich proved admirable training-schools for ambitious youths. William\r\nPorterfield and T. Preston Miller tramped over Oil Creek and Cherry Run\r\nfor the Fishers. Col. A. J. Greenfield, Bradley & Whiting and I. S.\r\nGibson bought at Rouseville and R. Richardson at Tarr Farm. “Pres”\r\nMiller, “Hi” Whiting and “Ike” Gibson—square, manly and honorable—are\r\ntreading the golden-streets. John Mawhinney—big in soul and body, true\r\nto the core and upright in every fiber—has voyaged to the haven of rest.\r\nWilliam Parker is president of the Oil City Savings Bank and Thompson\r\nreturned east years ago. John Munhall settled near Philadelphia and\r\nWilliam Haldeman removed to Cleveland. The iron-horse and the pipe-line\r\nrevolutionized the methods of handling crude and retired the shippers,\r\nmost of whom have shipped across the sea of time into the ocean of\r\neternity.\r\n\r\nFisher Brothers have a long and enviable record as shippers and\r\nproducers of oil, “staying the distance” and keeping the pole in the\r\nhottest race. Men have come and men have retreated in the mad whirl of\r\nspeculation and wild rush for the bottom of the sand, but they have gone\r\non steadily for a generation and are to-day abreast of the situation.\r\nWhether a district etched its name on the Rainbow of Fame or mocked the\r\ndreams of the oil-seeker, they did not lose their heads or their credit.\r\nJohn J. Fisher went to Oil City in 1862 and Fisher Brothers began\r\nshipping oil by the river to Pittsburg in 1863, succeeding John Burgess\r\n& Co. The three brothers divided their forces, to give each department\r\npersonal supervision, John J. managing the buying and shipping at Oil\r\nCity and Frederick and Henry receiving and disposing of the cargoes at\r\nPittsburg. Competent men bought crude at the wells and handled it in the\r\nyards and on the boats. The firm owned a fleet of bulk-boats and\r\ntow-boats and acres of barrels. Each barrel was branded with a huge F on\r\neither head. The “Big F”—widely known as Oil Creek or the Drake well—was\r\nthe trademark of fair play and spot cash. When railroads were built the\r\nFishers discarded boats and used more barrels than before. When\r\nwooden-tanks—a car held two—were introduced they adopted them and let\r\nthe barrels slide. When pipe-lines were laid they purchased\r\ncertificate-oil and continued to be large shippers until seaboard lines\r\nsuspended the older systems of freighting crude by water or rail, in\r\nbarrels or in tanks. From the beginning to the end of the shipping-trade\r\nFisher Brothers were in the van.\r\n\r\nNext devoting their attention entirely to the production of oil and gas,\r\nwith the Grandins and Adnah Neyhart they invested heavily at Fagundas\r\nand laid the first pipe-line at Tidioute. They operated below Franklin\r\nand were pioneers at Petrolia. Organizing the Fisher Oil-Company, they\r\ndrilled in all the Butler pools and held large interests at McDonald and\r\nWashington. At present they are operating in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West\r\nVirginia, the Fisher ranking with the foremost companies in extent and\r\nsolidity. The brothers have their headquarters in the Germania Building,\r\nPittsburg, and juicy wells in a dozen counties. Time has dealt kindly\r\nwith all three, as well as with Daniel Fisher, ex-mayor of Oil City.\r\nThey have loads of experience and capital and too much energy to think\r\nof adjusting their halo for retirement from active work. True men in all\r\nthe relations of life, Fisher Brothers worthily represent the splendid\r\nindustry they have had no mean part in making the greatest and grandest\r\nof any age or nation. To natural shrewdness and the quick perception\r\nthat comes from contact with the activities of the world they joined\r\nbusiness-ability that would have proved successful in whatever career\r\nthey undertook to map out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FREDERICK FISHER\r\n  JOHN J. FISHER       HENRY FISHER\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion of improvement in transportation was made in 1860,\r\nat Parkersburg, W. Va., by General Karns to C. L. Wheeler, now of\r\nBradford. An old salt-well Karns had resurrected at Burning Springs\r\npumped oil freely and he conceived the plan of a six-inch line of pipe\r\nto Parkersburg to run the product by gravity. The war interfered and the\r\nproject was not carried out. At a meeting at Tarr Farm, in November of\r\n1861, Heman Janes broached the idea of laying a line of four-inch\r\n_wooden-pipes_ to Oil City, to obviate the risk, expense and uncertainty\r\nof transporting oil by boats or wagons. He proposed to bury the pipe in\r\na trench along the bank of the creek and let the oil gravitate to its\r\ndestination. A contract for the entire work was drawn with James Reed,\r\nof Erie. Col. Clark, of Clark & Sumner, grasped the vast possibilities\r\nthe method might involve and advised applying to the Legislature for a\r\ngeneral pipe-line charter. Reed’s contract was not signed and a bill was\r\nintroduced in 1862 to authorize the construction of a pipe-line from Oil\r\nCreek to Kittanning. The opposition of four-thousand teamsters engaged\r\nin hauling oil defeated the bill and the first effort to organize a\r\npipe-line company.\r\n\r\nJ. L. Hutchings, a Jersey genius, came to the oil-country in the spring\r\nof 1862 with a rotary-pump he had patented. To show its adaptation to\r\nthe oil-business he laid a string of tubing from Tarr Farm to the\r\nHumboldt Refinery, below Plumer. He set his pump working and sent a\r\nstream of crude over the hills to the refinery. The pipe was of poor\r\nquality, the joints leaked and a good deal of oil fell by the wayside,\r\nyet the experiment showed that the idea was feasible. Although eminent\r\nengineers declared friction would be fatal, the result proved that\r\ndistance and grade were not insurmountable. Eminent engineers had\r\ndeclared the locomotive would not run on smooth rails and that a cow on\r\nthe track would disrupt George Stephenson’s whole system of travel,\r\nhence their dictum regarding pipe-lines had little weight. Dr. Dionysius\r\nLardner nearly burst a flue laughing at the absurdity of a vessel\r\nwithout sails crossing the ocean and wrote a treatise to demonstrate its\r\nimpossibility, but the saucy Sirius steamed over the herring-pond all\r\nthe same. The rotary-pump at Tarr Farm confounded the scientists who\r\nworshipped theory and believed friction would knock out steam and pipe\r\nand American ingenuity and keep oil-operators forever subject to mud and\r\npond-freshets. The two-inch line to the Humboldt Refinery planted the\r\nseed that was to become a great tree. Nobody saw this more plainly than\r\nthe teamsters, who proceeded to tear up the pipe and warn producers to\r\nquit monkeying with new-fangled methods of transportation. That settled\r\nthe first pipe-line and left the rampant teamsters, modern imitators of\r\n“Demetrius the silversmith,” the upper dog in the fight.\r\n\r\nHutchings—the boys called him “Hutch”—had pump and pipe-line on the\r\nbrain and would not be suppressed. He put down a line in 1863 from the\r\nbig Sherman well to the terminus of the railroad at Miller Farm. The\r\npipes were cast-iron, connected by lead-sockets and laid in a shallow\r\nditch. The jarring of the pump loosened the joints and three-fourths of\r\nthe oil started at the well failed to reach the tanks, two miles north.\r\nThe teamsters were not in business solely for their health and they tore\r\nup the line to be sure it would not cut off any of their revenue.\r\nHutchings persisted in his endeavors until debts overwhelmed him and he\r\ndied penniless and disappointed. The ill-starred inventor, who lived a\r\ntrifle ahead of the times, deserves a bronze statue on a shaft of\r\nimperishable granite.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature granted a pipe-line charter in 1864 to the Western\r\nTransportation Company, which laid a line from the Noble & Delamater\r\nwell to Shaffer. The cast-iron pipe, five inches in diameter, was laid\r\non a regular grade in the mode of a water-pipe. The lead points leaked\r\nlike a fifty-cent umbrella, just as the Hutchings line had done, and the\r\nattempt to improve transportation was abandoned.\r\n\r\nSamuel Van Syckle, a Jerseyite of inventive bent, arrived at Titusville\r\nin the fall of 1864. The problem of oil-transportation, rendered\r\nespecially important by the opening of the Pithole field, soon engrossed\r\nhis attention. In August of 1865 he completed a two-inch line from\r\nPithole to Miller Farm. Mr. Wood and Henry Ohlen, of New York, held an\r\ninterest and the First National Bank of Titusville loaned the money to\r\nforward the project. J. N. Wheeler screwed the first joints together.\r\nTwo pump-stations, a mile west of Pithole and at Cherry Run, at first\r\nhelped force the oil through the pipe, which was buried two feet under\r\nground “to be out of the way of the farmer’s plow.” Eight-hundred\r\nbarrels a day could be run and the frantic teamsters talked of resorting\r\nto violence to cripple so formidable a rival. The pipeage was one dollar\r\na barrel, at which rate the Pithole and Miller Farm Pipe-Line ought to\r\nhave been a bonanza. Van Syckle traded heavily in oil and commanded\r\nplenty of capital. A. W. Smiley managed the line and bought oil for Van\r\nSyckle, who conducted this branch of business in his son’s name.\r\nSmiley’s largest transaction was a purchase of one-hundred-thousand\r\nbarrels, at five dollars a barrel, from the United-States Petroleum\r\nCompany, in one lot. Young Van Syckle spent money as the whim struck\r\nhim. If Smiley refused his demand for a hundred or a thousand dollars,\r\nthe fly youth would refuse to sign drafts and threaten to stop the whole\r\nconcern. There was nothing to do in such cases but imitate Colonel\r\nScott’s coon and “come down.” The Culver failure in May of 1866\r\ncompelled the First National Bank to press its claim against the line,\r\nwhich passed into the hands of Jonathan Watson. J. T. Briggs and George\r\nS. Stewart operated it for the bank and Watson until William H. Abbott\r\nand Henry Harley purchased the entire equipment.\r\n\r\nReverses beset Van Syckle, who induced George S. and Milton Stewart to\r\nerect a big refinery at Titusville to test his pet theory of “continuous\r\ndistillation.” Failure, tedious litigation and heavy loss resulted. Van\r\nSyckle’s mind teemed with new schemes and new devices for refining. He\r\npossessed the rare faculty of finding friends willing to listen to his\r\nplans and back him with cash. Some of his ideas were valuable and they\r\nare in use to-day. Mismanagement swamped the enterprises he created and\r\nVan Syckle finally removed to Buffalo, where his checkered life closed\r\npeacefully on March second, 1894. While often unsuccessful financially,\r\nearnest men like Samuel Van Syckle benefit mankind. The oil-business is\r\nmuch better for the fertile brain and perseverance of the man whose\r\npipe-line was the first to deliver oil to a railroad. His example\r\nstimulated other men combining keen perception and executive ability,\r\nwho could sift the wheat from the chaff and discard the useless and\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1865 Henry Harley began a pipe-line from Benninghoff Run\r\nto Shaffer, the terminus of the Oil-Creek Railroad. Teamsters cut the\r\npipes, burned the tanks and retarded the work seriously. An armed patrol\r\narrested twenty of the ring-leaders, dispersed the mob and quelled the\r\nriot. The line—two-inch tubing of extra weight—handled oil\r\nexpeditiously, a pump at Benninghoff forcing six to eight-hundred\r\nbarrels a day into the tanks at Shaffer. The system was a public\r\nimprovement, personal interest had to yield and four-hundred teams left\r\nthe region the week Harley’s line pumped its first oil. Abbott and\r\nHarley owned an interest in the Pithole line and secured control by\r\npurchasing Jonathan Watson’s claim, to run it in connection with the\r\nBenninghoff line. They organized the firm of Abbott & Harley and\r\noperated both lines several months. At Miller Farm they constructed\r\niron-tanks and loading-racks, which enabled two men to load a train of\r\noil-cars in a few hours. Avery & Hedden laid a line from Shamburg to\r\nMiller Farm, establishing a station on the highest point of the Tallman\r\nfarm and running the oil to the railroad by gravity. Abbott & Harley\r\nsupplemented this with a branch from the Pithole line at the crossing of\r\nCherry Run. Crude was a good price, operators prospered and Miller Farm\r\nbecame a busy place. Railroads extended to the region and pipe-lines\r\npumped oil directly from the wells to the cars or refineries. In the\r\nfall of 1867 Abbott & Harley acquired control of the Western\r\nTransportation Company, the only one empowered by the Legislature to\r\npipe oil to railway-stations. Under its charter they combined the\r\nWestern and their own two lines as the Allegheny Transportation Company.\r\nThe first board of directors, elected in January of 1869, consisted of\r\nHenry Harley, president; W. H. Abbott, secretary; Jay Gould, J. P.\r\nHarley and Joshua Douglass. T. W. Larsen was appointed treasurer and\r\nWilliam Warmcastle—genial, capable “Billy” Warmcastle—general\r\nsuperintendent. Jay Gould purchased a majority of the stock in 1868 and\r\nappointed Mr. Harley general oil-agent of the Atlantic & Great Western\r\nand Erie Railroads. In 1871 the Commonwealth Oil and Pipe Company was\r\norganized in the interest of the Oil-Creek Railroad. Harley contrived to\r\neffect a combination and reorganize the Allegheny and the Commonwealth\r\nas the Pennsylvania Transportation Company, with a capital of nearly\r\ntwo-million dollars and five-hundred miles of pipes to Tidioute,\r\nTriumph, Irvineton, Oil City, Shamburg, Pleasantville and Titusville,\r\ncentering at Miller Farm. Among the stock-holders were Jay Gould, Thomas\r\nA. Scott, William H. Kemble, Mrs. James Fisk and George K. Anderson. The\r\nnew enterprise absorbed a swarm of small lines and was considered the\r\nacme of pipe-line achievement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. H. ABBOTT.     PIPE-LINE AT MILLER FARM IN\r\n1866.     HENRY HARLEY.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Hawkins Abbott was a Connecticut boy, an Ohio merchant at\r\ntwenty-five and a visitor to the Drake well in February of 1860. He\r\nremained two days, paid ten-thousand dollars for three one-eighth\r\ninterests in farms below the town and two days after William Barnsdall\r\nstruck a fifty-barrel well on one of the properties. He located at\r\nTitusville, established a market for crude in New York, shipped\r\nextensively and in the fall of 1860, with James Parker and William\r\nBarnsdall as partners, began the erection of the first complete refinery\r\nin the oil-region. To convey the boilers and stills from Oil City,\r\nwhither they were shipped from Pittsburg by water, was a task greater\r\nthan the labors of Hercules. The first car-load of coal ever seen in\r\nTitusville Mr. Abbott laid down in the fall of 1862. He opened a\r\ncoal-yard and superintended the refinery. Oil fluctuated at a rate\r\ncalculated to make refiners bald-headed. In January of 1861 Abbott paid\r\nten dollars a barrel for crude and one-twenty-five in March. In October\r\nof 1862 Howe & Nyce stored five-hundred barrels of crude on the first\r\nrailroad-platform at Titusville, selling it to Abbott at two-sixty a\r\nbarrel, packages included. In January of 1863 Abbott sold the oil from\r\nthe same platform for fourteen dollars and in March the same lot—it had\r\nnever been moved—brought eight dollars. Thirty days later Abbott bought\r\nit again at three dollars a barrel and refined it. He was interested in\r\nthe Noble well, bought a large share in the Pithole and Miller Farm\r\nPipe-Line and in 1866 formed a partnership with Henry Harley. He\r\ncontributed largely to the Titusville and Pithole plank-road and all\r\nlocal enterprises likely to benefit the community. His generosity was\r\ncomprehensive and discerning. He donated a chapel to the Episcopal\r\ncongregation, projected the Union & Titusville Railroad and was a most\r\nexemplary, public-spirited citizen. To give bountifully was his delight.\r\nHe bore financial disaster heroically and labored incessantly to save\r\nothers from loss. At seventy-two he is patient and helpful to those\r\nabout him, his daily life illustrating his real worth and illumining the\r\npathway of his declining years.\r\n\r\nBorn in Ohio in 1839 and graduated from the Rensselaer Polytechnic\r\nInstitute as a civil-engineer in 1858, Henry Harley supervised the\r\nconstruction of the Hoosac Tunnel until the war and settled at Pittsburg\r\nin 1862 as active partner of Richardson, Harley & Co. The firm had a\r\nlarge petroleum commission-house and Harley removed to Philadelphia in\r\n1863 to manage its principal branch. He purchased large tracts in West\r\nVirginia which did not meet his expectations, withdrew from the\r\ncommission-firm and in the latter part of 1865 built his first\r\npipe-line. He was the confidential friend of Jay Gould and James Fisk,\r\nwhose support placed him in a position to organize the Pennsylvania\r\nTransportation Company. For years Harley swam on the topmost wave and\r\nwas a high-roller of the loftiest stripe. Henry Villard was not more\r\nmagnetic. He told good stories, dealt out good cigars, knew champagne\r\nfrom seltzer and had no trace of the miser in his intercourse with the\r\nworld. He lived at Titusville in regal style and made “the grand tour of\r\nEurope” in 1872. He was on intimate terms with railroad magnates, big\r\npoliticians and Napoleons of finance. The Pipe-Line Company got into\r\ndeep waters, prosecutions and legal entanglements crippled it and Henry\r\nHarley tumbled with the fabric his genius had reared. He drifted to New\r\nYork, was a familiar figure around Chautauqua several seasons and died\r\nin 1892. His widow lives in New York and his brother George, a popular\r\nmember of the Oil-City Oil-Exchange, died last year.\r\n\r\nIn November of 1865 the Oil City & Pithole Railroad Company began a\r\nrailroad between the two towns, pushing the work with such energy that\r\nthe first train from Pithole to Oil City was run on March tenth, 1866.\r\nVandergrift & Forman equipped the Star Tank-Line to carry oil in\r\ntank-cars and laid the Star Pipe-Line from West Pithole to Pithole to\r\nconnect with the railroad. An unequivocal success from the start, this\r\npipe-line has been regarded as the real beginning of the present system\r\nof oil-transportation. The lower oil-country enlarged the field for\r\npipe-line stations. Lines multiplied in Venango, Clarion, Armstrong and\r\nButler. Some of these were controlled by Vandergrift & Forman, who\r\nbrought the business to a high standard of perfection. Each district had\r\none or more lines running to the nearest railroad. The Pennsylvania\r\nTransportation Company secured a charter in 1875 to construct a line to\r\nthe seaboard. Nothing was done except to build more lines in the\r\noil-region. The number grew continually. Clarion had a half-dozen, the\r\nAntwerp heading the list. Parker had a brood of small-fry and Butler was\r\nnet-worked. It was the fashion to talk of trunk-lines, call public\r\nmeetings, subscribe for stock and—let the project die. Dr. Hostetter,\r\nthe Pittsburg millionaire of “Bitters” fame, built the Conduit Line from\r\nMillerstown to the city of smoke and soot. The Karns, the Relief and\r\nothers ran to Harrisville. Every fellow wanted a finger in the pipe-line\r\npot-pie. A war of competition arose, rates were cut, business was done\r\nat heavy loss and the weaker concerns went to the wall. The companies\r\nissued certificates or receipts, instead of paying cash for crude\r\nreceived by their lines. When the producer ran oil into the\r\nstorage-tanks of some companies he was not certain the certificates\r\ngiven him in return would have any value next day. He must either use\r\nthe lines or leave the oil in the ground. The necessity of combining the\r\nbadly-managed competitive companies into a solid organization was\r\nurgent. The Union Pipe-Line Company acquired a number of lines and\r\noperated its system in connection with the Empire Line. Under the act of\r\n1874 Vandergrift & Forman organized the United Pipe-Lines, into which\r\nnumerous local lines were merged. The first grand step had been taken in\r\nthe direction of settling the question of oil-transportation for all\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the consolidation quickly commended the new order of\r\nthings to the public. The United Lines erected hundreds of iron-tanks\r\nfor storage and connected with every producing-well. Needless pipes and\r\npumps and stations were removed to be utilized as required. The best\r\nappliances were adopted, improving the service and diminishing its cost.\r\nUniform rates were established and every detail was systematized.\r\nCaptain Vandergrift, president of the United Lines, was ably assisted in\r\neach department. Daniel O’Day, a potent force in pipe-line affairs,\r\ndeveloped the system to an exact science. He learned the\r\nshipping-business from the very rudiments in the great Empire Line. His\r\nthorough knowledge, industry and practical talent were of incalculable\r\nvalue to the United Lines. He possessed in full measure the qualities\r\nadapted especially to the expansion and improvement of the giant\r\nenterprise. He had the skill to plan wisely and the ability to execute\r\npromptly. His sagacity and experience foresaw the magnificent future of\r\nthe system and he laid the foundations of the United Lines broad and\r\ndeep. To-day Daniel O’Day is a master-spirit of the pipe-line world, a\r\nmillionaire and vice-president of the National Transit Company, which\r\ntransports nine-tenths of the oil produced in the United States. He has\r\nrisen by personal desert, without favoritism or partiality. His\r\nelevation has not subtracted one whit from the manly character that\r\ngained him innumerable friends in the oil-region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DANIEL O’DAY\r\n  J R CAMPBELL        EDWARD HOPKINS.\r\n  PUMPING OIL FROM TROUTMAN WELL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEdward Hopkins, first manager of the United Pipe-Lines, was an efficient\r\nofficer and died young. John R. Campbell has been treasurer from the\r\nincorporation of the lines in 1877. Born in Massachusetts and graduated\r\nfrom Rev. Samuel Aaron’s celebrated school at Norristown, he served his\r\napprenticeship in the Baldwin Locomotive Works and manufactured\r\nprinting-inks in Philadelphia, with William L. and Charles H. Lay as\r\npartners. In March of 1865 he visited the oil-region and in August\r\nremoved to Oil City. He acquired oil-interests, published the _Register_\r\nand was treasurer for the receiver of the Oil City & Pithole Railroad\r\nCompany. In 1867 he became book-keeper for Vandergrift & Lay, afterwards\r\nfor Captain Vandergrift and later for Vandergrift & Forman, who\r\nappointed him treasurer of their pipe-lines in 1868. He retained the\r\nposition in the United Lines and he is still treasurer of that division\r\nof the National Transit Company. To Mr. Campbell is largely due the\r\naccurate and comprehensive system of pipe-line accounts now universally\r\nadopted. He aided in devising negotiable oil-certificates, reliable as\r\ngovernment bonds and convertible into cash at any moment. He enjoys to\r\nthe fullest extent the confidence and esteem of his associates and is\r\ntreasurer of a dozen large corporations. He was president term after\r\nterm of the Ivy Club, one of the finest social organizations in\r\nPennsylvania, and a liberal promoter of important enterprises. His\r\nabiding faith in Oil City he manifests by investing in manufactures and\r\nfurthering public improvements. Active, helpful and popular in business,\r\nin society and in the church, no eulogy could add to the high estimation\r\nin which John R. Campbell is held wherever known.\r\n\r\nThe enormous production of the Bradford field, the increased distances\r\nand the construction of lines to the sea presented new and difficult\r\nproblems. A natural increase in size led to a demand for pipe of better\r\nquality, for heavier fittings and improved machinery. The largest line\r\nprior to Bradford’s advent was a four-inch pipe from the Butler field to\r\nPittsburg, in 1875. Excepting this and three-inch lines to Raymilton and\r\nOil City, none of the main lines exceeded twelve miles in length. Many\r\nwere gravity-lines and others used small tubing and light pumps. The\r\ngreater quantities and longer distances in the northern district—the oil\r\nalso congealed at a higher temperature and was harder to handle than the\r\nproduct of the lower fields—required greater power, larger pipes and\r\nincreased facilities. The first six-inch line was laid from Tarport to\r\nCarrollton in the spring of 1879. Two four-inch lines had preceded it\r\nand a four-inch line from Tarport to Kane was completed the same season,\r\nfive six-inch lines following later. The first long-distance line, a\r\nfive-inch pipe from Hilliards—near Petrolia—to Cleveland, was completed\r\nin the summer of 1879. Trunk-lines to the eastern coast were begun in\r\n1879-80. The trunk-line to Philadelphia starts at Colegrove, McKean\r\ncounty, and extends two-hundred-and-thirty-five miles—six-inch pipe—with\r\na five-inch branch of sixty-six miles from Millway to Baltimore.\r\nStarting at Olean, two six-inch lines were paralleled to Saddle River,\r\nN.J. They separated there, one connecting with the refineries at Bayonne\r\nand the other going under the North and East Rivers to Hunter’s Point,\r\non Long Island. The New-York line is double under the Hudson—one pipe\r\ninside another, with tight-fitting sleeve-joints. The ends of the\r\njacket-pipe were separated twelve inches to permit the enclosed pipe to\r\nbe screwed home. The sleeve was then pushed over the gap and the space\r\nbetween the pipes filled with melted lead. The line is held in place by\r\ntwo sets of heavy chains, parallel with and about twenty feet from the\r\npipe, one on each side. At intervals of three-hundred feet a guide-chain\r\nconnects the pipe with the lateral chains and beyond each of these\r\nconnections an anchor, weighing over a ton, keeps the whole in place.\r\nThe completion of this part of the line was an engineering triumph not\r\nmuch inferior to the laying of Cyrus W. Field’s Atlantic Cable.\r\n\r\nThe United Pipe-Lines Association moved forward steadily, avoiding the\r\npitfalls that had wrecked other systems. It bought or combined the\r\nOil-City, Antwerp, Union, Karns, Grant, Conduit, Relief, Pennsylvania,\r\nClarion and McKean divisions of the American-Transfer, Prentice, Olean,\r\nUnion Oil-Company’s at Clarendon, McCalmont at Cherry Grove and smaller\r\nlines, covering the oil-region from Allegany to Butler. The United owned\r\nthree-thousand miles of lines, thirty-five-million barrels of\r\niron-tankage and one-hundred-and-eighteen local pump-stations. Even\r\nthese extraordinary resources were strained by the overflowing demand.\r\nBradford was the Oliver Twist of the region, continually crying for\r\n“More!” Ohio and West Virginia entered the race and required facilities\r\nfor handling an amazing amount of oil. To meet any contingency and\r\nsecure the advantages of consolidation in the states producing oil the\r\nNational-Transit Company increased its capital to thirty-two-million\r\ndollars. The company held the original charter granted to the\r\nPennsylvania Company under the act of 1870. In 1880 it absorbed the\r\nAmerican-Transfer Company, an extensive concern. On April first, 1884,\r\nit acquired the plant and business of the United Lines, thus ranking\r\nwith the most powerful corporations in the land.\r\n\r\nMen entirely familiar with the minutest details of oil-transportation\r\nand storage guided the National Transit. Captain Vandergrift was\r\ninfluential in the management until his retirement from active duty in\r\n1892. President C. A. Griscom was succeeded by Benjamin Brewster and he\r\nby H. H. Rogers, the present official head of the company. John Bushnell\r\nwas secretary, Daniel O’Day general manager, and James R. Snow general\r\nsuperintendent. Skillful, practical and keenly alive to the necessities\r\nof the oil-region, they were not kid-gloved idlers whose chief aim was\r\nto draw fat salaries. Mr. Rogers made his mark on Oil Creek in pioneer\r\ntimes as a forceful, intelligent, progressive business-man. He had\r\nbrains, earnestness, integrity and industry and rose by positive merit\r\nto the presidency of the greatest transportation-company of the age. He\r\nis a first-class citizen, a liberal patron of education and an apostle\r\nof good roads. He endows schools and colleges, abounds in kindly deeds\r\nand does not forget his experiences in Oildom. Daniel O’Day—clever and\r\ncapable, “whom not to know is to argue one’s self unknown”—who has not\r\nheard of the plucky, invincible vice-president of the National Transit\r\nCompany? Everybody admires the genial, resolute son of Erin whose clear\r\nhead, willing hands, strong individuality and sterling qualities have\r\nraised him to a position Grover Cleveland might covet. James R. Snow\r\ninvented a pump so perfect that oil would fairly flow up hill for a\r\nchance to pass through the machine. From their Broadway offices Rogers,\r\nO’Day and Snow direct by telephone and telegraph the movements of\r\nregiments of employés in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana.\r\nThey are in direct communication with every office of the company, every\r\npurchasing-agency, every pump-station on the trunk-lines and every\r\noil-producing section of four states. No army Napoleon, Wellington or\r\nGrant commanded was better officered, better disciplined, better\r\nequipped and better managed than the grand army of National-Transit\r\npipe-men. If “poets are born, not made,” what shall be said of the\r\nwide-awake solvers of the problem of rapid transit for oil—the\r\npipe-liners who, combining the maximum of efficiency with the minimum of\r\ncost, have placed a great staple within reach of the lowliest dwellers\r\nbeneath the Stars and Stripes? Candidly, is “the best in the shop” too\r\ngood for them?\r\n\r\nNo man has contributed more to the development of the oil-industry,\r\nalike as a producer, refiner and transporter, than Captain J. J.\r\nVandergrift. His active connection with petroleum goes back to pioneer\r\noperations, widening and expanding constantly. By his energy,\r\nperseverance, uprightness and masterly traits of character he attained\r\nprominence in all branches of the oil-business. His wonderful success\r\nwas not due to any caprice of fortune, but to stability of purpose,\r\npatient application and honorable methods. Vigor and decision\r\nsupplemented the keen foresight that discovered the amazing\r\npossibilities of petroleum as an article of universal utility. He\r\nbelieved in the future of oil and shaped his course in accordance with\r\nthe broadest ideas. Allied with George V. Forman, clear-headed, quick to\r\nplan and execute, the firm took a leading part in producing and carrying\r\noil. Vandergrift & Forman constructed the Star Pipe-Line and equipped\r\ntrains of tank-cars to convey crude from Pithole to Oil City. They\r\ndrilled hosts of wells in Butler county and built the Fairview\r\nPipe-Line, which finally crystallized with numerous others into the\r\nUnited Pipe-Lines Association and the gigantic National-Transit Company.\r\nThe firm of H. L. Taylor & Co., of which they were members, originated\r\nthe Union Oil-Company. Vandergrift & Forman, Vandergrift, Pitcairn & Co.\r\nand Vandergrift, Young & Co. consolidated as the Forest Oil-Company,\r\nwhich holds the foremost place in the production of oil. Mr. Forman\r\noperated in Allegany and McKean, developing large tracts of territory on\r\nthe Bingham and Barse lands. He resided at Olean and established the\r\nfinest stock-farm in the Empire State. Removing to Buffalo to engage in\r\nbanking, he organized the Fidelity Trust-Company and erected for its use\r\na palatial structure in the heart of the city. Under his presidency the\r\nFidelity is a power in the world of finance. Shrewd, prompt and\r\nfar-seeing, George V. Forman is richly dowered with the qualities of\r\nbusiness-leadership. His influence in the oil-country was not limited to\r\none corner or district or locality. He has enjoyed the pleasure of\r\nmaking money and the greater pleasure of giving liberally. He is “a man\r\nwho thinks it out, then goes and does it.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PIPE LINE STATION.\r\n  CAPT. J. J. VANDERGRIFT.\r\n  OIL TANK CARS.\r\n  GEO. V. FORMAN.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBorn at Pittsburg in 1827, at fifteen Jacob Jay Vandergrift chose the\r\npathway that naturally opened before him and entered the\r\nsteamboat-service, then the chief medium of intercommunication between\r\nhis native city and the west. In ten years he rose from cabin-boy to\r\ncaptain. He introduced the method of towing coal-barges that has since\r\nbeen employed in the river-traffic. The innovation attracted wide\r\nattention and gave a great impetus to mining in the Pittsburg\r\ncoal-fields. Captain Vandergrift was steamboating on the Ohio when the\r\nwar broke out and owned the staunch Red Fox, which the government\r\nchartered and lost near Cairo. He transported oil down the Allegheny,\r\nwas concerned in West-Virginia wells—the Confederates destroyed them—and\r\nremoved to Oil City in 1863 to oversee his shipping-business, with\r\nDaniel Bushnell as his first partner in producing oil. He organized the\r\nfirms out of which grew the Union, the Forest, the Washington\r\nOil-Company and the United Oil and Gas Trust. He was president of the\r\nForest and the Washington and a leading promoter of the Anchor\r\nOil-Company. The success of these great companies was owing largely to\r\nhis peculiar ability as an organizer and manager of important\r\nenterprises. Other individuals and corporations produced oil profitably,\r\nbut to Vandergrift & Forman the marvelous advance in modes of\r\ntransportation is mainly attributable. They piped and railroaded oil\r\nfrom Pithole, extended their lines through the different fields, devised\r\nmany improvements, perfected the methods of handling the product and\r\ndeveloped the system that has eliminated jaded horses, wooden-barrels,\r\nmud-scows, slow freights and the thousand inconveniences of early\r\ntransportation. Captain Vandergrift’s sturdy integrity and wise\r\nforethought planned the open, clear-cut manner in which his pipe-lines\r\nconducted business. Throughout their entire existence he was president\r\nof the United Pipe-Lines and of the United Division of the\r\nNational-Transit after the consolidation in 1884. Their splendid record\r\nis an unqualified tribute to his business-skill and rare sagacity. He\r\nfound the region hampered by an expensive, tedious method of moving oil\r\nand left it a transportation-system that serves the industry as no other\r\non earth is served. He substituted the steam-pump for the wearied mule,\r\nthe iron-artery for the roads of bottomless mire and the huge cistern of\r\nboiler-plate for the portable tank of wooden staves that leaked at every\r\npore. To Oil City he was a munificent benefactor. He projected the\r\nImperial Refinery, with a capacity of fifteen-thousand barrels a week,\r\nby the sale of which he became a stockholder and officer of the Standard\r\nOil-Company. He aided in establishing the Boiler-Works, the\r\nBarrel-Works, river-bridges, manufactories, churches and public\r\nimprovements. He paid his workmen the highest wages, befriended the\r\nhumble toiler and assisted every worthy object. The poor blessed his\r\nbeneficent hand and all classes revered the modest citizen whose\r\nunostentatious deeds of kindness no party, race, color or creed could\r\nfor one moment restrict.\r\n\r\nVery naturally, one thus interested in a special product and its\r\nindustries must be identified with its finance. Captain Vandergrift\r\nfounded the Oil-City Trust-Company, one of the leading banking\r\ninstitutions of the state, and was prominent in organizing the\r\nOil-Exchange, the Seaboard-National Bank of New York and the Argyle\r\nSavings-Bank at Petrolia. Removing to Pittsburg in 1881, he founded the\r\nKeystone Bank and the Pittsburg Trust-Company—nine-hundred-thousand\r\ndollars paid-up capital and four-millions deposits—and was unanimously\r\nelected president of both. He provided spacious quarters for the\r\nOil-Exchange and established it on a sound basis. He erected the massive\r\nVandergrift Building on Fourth avenue, in which the National-Transit\r\nCompany, the Forest, the South-Penn, the Pennsylvania, the Woodland and\r\nother oil-companies are commodiously housed. The owner occupies a suite\r\nof offices on the second floor and the Pittsburg Trust-Company has its\r\nbank on the ground floor of the granite structure. He also erected the\r\nConestoga Building, which has seven-hundred elegant offices, and the\r\nImperial Power-Building, with factory-construction and the latest\r\nelectric-motors throughout. In 1882 he organized the Pennsylvania\r\nTube-Works—eight-hundred-thousand dollars capital—to manufacture all\r\nkinds of wrought-iron pipe. The output was so excellent that the capital\r\nwas increased to two-millions and the plant doubled. The works turn out\r\npipe from one-eighth inch to twenty-eight inches, the smallest and\r\nlargest sizes in the world. The Apollo Steel-Company, which he also\r\ncapitalized in 1885 at three-hundred-thousand dollars, has likewise\r\ntrebled its plant and enlarged its capital to two-millions. The Penn\r\nFuel-Company, the Bridgewater Gas Company, the Natural-Gas Company of\r\nWest Virginia, the Chartiers Natural-Gas Company, the United Oil and Gas\r\nTrust, the Toledo Natural-Gas Company, the Fort-Pitt Natural-Gas Company\r\nand a number more were incorporated by Captain Vandergrift. They\r\nrepresent many millions of capital and have performed inestimable\r\nservice in developing the fuel that proved a veritable philosopher’s\r\nstone to the iron-industries of Western-Pennsylvania. As in petroleum,\r\nfrom the days of spring-poles and bulk-barges and pond-freshets down\r\nthrough all the changes of the most remarkable industrial development\r\nthe world has ever seen, so Captain Vandergrift has been a pioneer, a\r\nguide and a leader in natural-gas. His hand has never been off the helm,\r\nnor has he ever grudged an atom of the energy bestowed upon the\r\ncherished pursuits of his busy life.\r\n\r\nForty miles north-east of Pittsburg, on a beautiful bend of the\r\nKiskiminetas River, the new town of Vandergrift has been laid out, under\r\nthe direction of Frederick Law Olmsted. It is located on a plot one mile\r\nsquare, two miles below Apollo, the gentle slope overlooking the valley\r\nand the river for leagues. Its residents will have within easy reach of\r\nsimple thrift what luxurious people enjoy in large cities at great\r\nexpense. They will have clean air and water and breathing-room, green\r\nleaves and flowers and grass, paved streets and sewers and electricity,\r\nparks and walks and drives, shade-trees and lawns and pleasant homes,\r\nfor Vandergrift will be the model town of Pennsylvania. The company is\r\npaying sixty-thousand dollars a month at Apollo in wages and the big\r\nworks at Vandergrift will employ thrice as many men. At first the bulk\r\nof the town will be the habitations of those employed by and associated\r\nwith the company. After a little others will note its advantages and\r\ndesire to share them. Provision will be made this year for an immediate\r\npopulation of several thousand, with the means of living comfortably,\r\nfamilies owning their homes and controlling their own pursuits. The town\r\nis not to be a fad, a hobby, or a visionary Utopia, but a good place for\r\nmen to live in, for the founder to use his money, for the world to look\r\nat and learn from. These banks and business-blocks, pipe-lines and\r\nrefineries, mills and factories and the town that bears his name are\r\nenduring monuments to the enterprise and wisdom of a man who recognizes\r\nthe responsibilities of wealth in his investments, in his works of\r\nphilanthropy and in his gifts to the children of misfortune.\r\n\r\nCaptain Vandergrift’s home in Allegheny City is a center of good cheer\r\nand genial hospitality. The host is the same kindly, companionable\r\ngentleman by his own hearth, in his office or on the street. He casts\r\nthe lead of memory into the stream of the past and talks entertainingly\r\nof the old days on the Ohio, the Allegheny and Oil Creek. He is never\r\ntoo much engaged to welcome a comrade of his early years. He has not\r\nlost touch with men or the spirit of sympathy with the struggling and\r\nunsuccessful. His trials and vicissitudes, equally with his triumphs and\r\nsuccesses, have strengthened his moral fiber, his manly courage and his\r\nnobility of character. Doubtful plans and purposes have had no place in\r\nhis policy. Strict honesty and fairness have governed his conduct and\r\nrespected the rights and privileges of his fellows. He has been quick to\r\ndiscover and reward talent, to grasp the details and possibilities of\r\nbusiness and to mature plans for any emergency. Money has not shriveled\r\nhis soul and narrowed him to the prayer of selfishness: “Give _me_ this\r\nday _my_ daily bread.” He prefers straightforwardness to a pedigree\r\nrunning back to the Mayflower. He realizes that golden opportunities for\r\ngood are not traveling by a time-table and that men will not journey\r\nthis way again to repair omissions and rectify mistakes. He knows that\r\nhe who does right will be right and feel right. He does not lay aside\r\nhis sense of justice, his love of fair-play, his earnest convictions and\r\nhis desire to benefit mankind with his Sunday clothes. He believes that\r\nprinciple which is not exercised every day will not keep sweet a week.\r\nThe story of J. J. Vandergrift’s life and labor is told wherever the\r\nflame of natural-gas glows in the white heat of a furnace or the gleam\r\nof an oil-lamp brightens a happy home.\r\n\r\n    Somehow we all feel sure, boys, that when the game is o’er—\r\n    When the last inning’s play’d, boys, this side the other shore—\r\n    We’ll hear the Umpire say, boys: “The Captain’s made a score.”\r\n\r\nFew persons have any conception of the labor and capital involved in\r\nstoring and transporting petroleum. Only those familiar with the early\r\nmethods can appreciate fully the convenience and economy of the\r\npipe-line system. It puts the producer in direct communication with the\r\ncarrier and a market at all seasons, regardless of high or low water,\r\nrain or storm, mud or dust. The tanks at his wells are connected with\r\nthe pipe-line by one or more of the two-inch feeders that spider-web the\r\nproducing-country. Small pumps force the crude, when the location of the\r\nwell prevents running it by gravity, from these tanks into a\r\nreceiving-tank of the line, whence it can be piped into the trunk-lines\r\nor a storage-tank as desired. The producer who wishes his oil run\r\nnotifies the nearest office or agent of the company—usually this\r\nrequires about two minutes by wire—a gauger measures the feet and inches\r\nof fluid in the tank, opens the stop-cock, turns the stream into the\r\nline and, presto, change! the job is done. The gauger measures the oil\r\nleft at the bottom of the tank, gives the producer a receipt for the\r\ndifference between the two gauges and reports the result to the central\r\nstation of that section of the field. There tables of the measurements\r\nof every tank in the locality are at hand, properly labeled and\r\nnumbered. The right table shows at a glance the amount of oil in barrels\r\ncorresponding to the feet and inches the gauger reports having run and\r\nthe producer is credited accordingly, just like a depositor in a bank.\r\nThese reports are summed up at a certain hour and the company learns\r\nprecisely how much oil has been received each day. By a similar process\r\nthe shipments are recorded and the exact quantity in the custody of the\r\ncompany is known at the close of the day’s business. Runs and shipments\r\nare published daily and a monthly synopsis is posted, in compliance with\r\nthe laws of Pennsylvania. The producer can leave his oil in the line,\r\nsubject to a slight charge for storage after thirty days, or sell it\r\nimmediately. He can take certificates or acceptances of one thousand\r\nbarrels each, payable on demand in crude-oil at any shipping-point in\r\nthe oil-region. These certificates, good as gold and negotiable as\r\ncertified checks, the holder can use as collateral to borrow money, sell\r\nat sight or stow away if he looks for an advance in prices. It is not\r\nHobson’s choice with him. In an hour from the time of notifying the\r\noffice his oil may be run, the amount figured up, the sale made and the\r\ncurrency in the owner’s pocket. He has not tugged and perspired loading\r\nit in wagons or on cars, worn out his patience and his team and his\r\nprofanity driving it through an ocean of mud, or risked the chances of a\r\njam and a wreck ferrying it on the bosom of a pond-freshet. Nor has he\r\nput up one penny for the service of the pipe-line, which collects twenty\r\ncents a barrel when the oil is delivered to the purchaser. The company\r\nis not a holder of oil on its own account, except what it necessarily\r\nkeeps to offset evaporation and sediment, acting merely as a\r\ncommon-carrier between the producer and the refiner. The system is the\r\nperfection of simplicity, accuracy and cheapness.\r\n\r\nPipe-lines are the natural outgrowth of the petroleum-business, which\r\ncould no more get along without them than could the commerce of the\r\nworld without railroads and steamships. The movement of a thousand\r\nbarrels of crude in early times was a task of great magnitude, costly,\r\ntime-consuming and perplexing. Sometimes barrels were not to be had, the\r\nwater was too shallow for boating or the mud too deep for teaming. Often\r\na big well wasted half its product and gorged transportation, harassing\r\nthe soul and depleting the purse of the luckless owner. Fancy attempting\r\nto handle a hundred-thousand barrels a day with the primitive\r\nappliances! Whew! You might as well try to cart off Niagara in kegs.\r\nButler and McKean rushed wells by the hundred every week, swelling the\r\nproduction extravagantly. The supply was enormously in excess of the\r\ndemand. Operators wouldn’t stop drilling and the surplus oil had to be\r\ncared for in some way. The United Lines and the National-Transit Company\r\nspent millions of dollars to provide adequate facilities. Not only was\r\nthe vast output to be taken from the wells, but a large percentage must\r\nbe stored. To pipe a hundred-and-forty-thousand barrels a day was a\r\ngrand achievement, even without the burden of husbanding much of the\r\nstuff for weeks, months and years. A wilderness of iron-tanks—thirty to\r\nforty thousand barrels each—went up at Olean, Oil City, Raymilton,\r\nParker and distributing points. Stocks increased and tanks multiplied\r\nuntil forty-million barrels were piled up! Think of the mountains of\r\npipe, the acres of iron-plates, the legions of workmen and the stacks of\r\ncash all this required. Six pipes were laid to New York and the\r\nTidewater Company built a six-inch line to New Jersey. The trunk-lines\r\nof the National-Transit alone are five-thousand miles in length, besides\r\nwhich the Tidewater and the United-States pipe oil eastward.\r\nFifty-thousand barrels of crude a day flow through these underground\r\narteries to the refineries at Hunter’s Point, Bayonne and Philadelphia.\r\nOther thousands are piped to Baltimore, Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburg\r\nand refineries in the oil-region. The pipe used in transporting crude\r\nwould girdle the earth twice and leave a long string for extra-measure.\r\nTruly “these be piping times.”\r\n\r\nMcDonald gushers poured out their floods, but the National-Transit and\r\nMellon Lines were on deck with pumps and pipes that snatched the\r\ncontents of the tanks and whirled them to the sea. John McKeown’s\r\nleviathan at Washington electrified the neighborhood by starting at\r\nthree-hundred barrels an hour, with only three small tanks to hold the\r\nproduct. It filled the first in forty minutes. Superintendent Glenn\r\nBraden set up a pump in thirty minutes more that would empty the tank in\r\na half-hour. All night it was nip and tuck between the spouter and the\r\npump, big Goliath and puny David. The pump won, the oil was safe in the\r\nline and not a drop spilled! West-Virginia’s geysers burst forth and the\r\nSouthern Trunk-Line—three-hundred miles of eight-inch and six-inch\r\npipe—linked Morgantown to Philadelphia. Lima tried to drown Ohio in\r\ncrude and an eight-inch line quietly dumped the deluge into Chicago.\r\nPart of it fired the half-mile row of boilers at the Columbian\r\nExposition, with not a cinder, a speck of ashes or a whiff of smoke to\r\ndim the lustrous flame of fuel-oil. Indiana, the home of some pretty big\r\nstatesmen, some pretty big oil-territory and “the Hoosier Schoolmaster,”\r\nhad a surfeit of crude which the pipe-lines bore to the huge refinery at\r\nWhiting, to Cleveland and the Windy City. Thus the development of new\r\nfields, remote from railroads, has been rendered possible.\r\n\r\nTrunk-lines require pipe of extra weight, manufactured expressly for the\r\npurpose from wrought-iron, lap-welded, cut into lengths of eighteen feet\r\nand tested to a pressure of two-thousand pounds to the square inch.\r\nPumping-stations, supplied with powerful machinery, are located at\r\nsuitable points, generally twenty-five to thirty miles apart. The\r\nstations on the National-Transit trunk-lines usually comprise a\r\nboiler-house forty feet square, built of brick and roofed with\r\ncorrugated iron, lighted by electricity and containing seven or eight\r\ntubular boilers of eighty to one-hundred horse-power. For greater safety\r\nfrom fire the immense pumps are in a separate brick-building. The\r\nlargest pumps are triple-expansion crank and fly-wheel engines, the\r\ninvention of John S. Klein, superintendent of the company’s\r\nmachine-shops at Oil City. Each of these giants can force\r\ntwenty-five-thousand barrels of oil a day through three six-inch pipes\r\nfrom one station to the next. A low-duty engine is run when the\r\nmain-pump is stopped for repairs or any cause. At each station two or\r\nmore storage-tanks—thirty to thirty-five thousand barrels apiece—are\r\nprovided. One receives the oil from the preceding station while the pump\r\nis emptying the other into the receiver at the station beyond. The\r\nmovement is incessant. Night and day, never tiring and never resting,\r\nthe iron-arteries throb and pulsate with the greasy liquid that rushes\r\nswiftly a yard beneath the surface, duplicate machinery obviating the\r\nnecessity of delay or interruption. Five or six boilers are fired at\r\nonce and two are held in reserve, in case of accident. Loops are laid\r\naround some of the stations, that a pump may send the oil two or three\r\ntimes the average distance and the total disability of a station not\r\nblockade the line. When lofty hills are surmounted the pressure on the\r\npump reaches twelve to fifteen-hundred pounds. Independent\r\ntelegraph-lines connect the stations with one another and the\r\nmain-offices. The engineers handle the key and click messages expertly.\r\nThe lines are patrolled regularly to detect leaks, although the system\r\nof checking from tank to tank makes it impossible for a serious break to\r\npass unnoticed. To clear the incrustations of paraffine, especially in\r\ncold weather, a scraper or “go-devil” is sent through the pipes. The\r\nbest of these instruments—a spindle with a ball-and-socket-joint near\r\nits center to follow the bends of the pipe, fitted with steel-blades set\r\nradially and kept in position by three arms in front and rear—was\r\ndevised by Mr. Klein. Oblique vanes, put in motion by the running oil,\r\nrotate the spindle and the blades scrape the pipe as the “go-devil” is\r\npropelled forward. A catch-box is placed at the end of each division and\r\nthe queer traveler can be closely timed. The great battery of boilers,\r\nthe huge engine-pumps—one on the Lima-Chicago line weighs a hundred\r\ntons—the electric-plants and the intricate maze of steam-pipes and\r\nwater-pipes suggest the machinery of an ocean-steamship.\r\n\r\nIf the railroad is “the missionary of punctuality,” as Robert Burdette\r\nconcisely expresses it, surely the pipe-line is the messenger of\r\nefficiency. With wondrous speed and unfailing certainty it conveys\r\ncrude-oil from the wells to the refineries in or out of the region,\r\nclimbing hills, descending ravines, fathoming rivers and traversing\r\nplains and forests. Methods of refining have kept pace with progress in\r\ntransportation. The smoky, dangerous, inconvenient kettle-still of the\r\npioneer on Oil Creek has given place to the mammoth refinery of to-day,\r\nwith its labor-saving appliances, its hundreds of skilled employés and\r\nits improved processes. Instead of the ill-smelling, sputtering,\r\nexplosive mixture of earlier years, the world now receives the\r\nwater-white kerosene that burns as steadily and safely as a wax-taper.\r\nSeventy tank-vessels carry it over the seas to Europe, Asia and Africa.\r\nIt is delivered at your house in neat cans, or the grocer will sell it\r\nby the pint, quart, gallon or barrel. The light is pure as heaven’s own\r\nsunshine, grateful to the eye and beautifying to the home. No other\r\nsubstance approaches petroleum in the number and utility of its\r\nproducts. Long years of patient research and experiment have extracted\r\nfrom it one-hundred-and-fifty articles of value in art, science,\r\nmechanics and domestic economy. It supplies healing-salves, ointments,\r\ncosmetics, soaps, dainty toilet-accessories and—oh, girly Vassar\r\ngirls—chewing-gum! Refuse tar and scum are converted into lamp-black and\r\ncoarse lubricants. Scarcely a particle of it goes to waste. Noxious\r\ngases and poisonous acids no longer pollute the air and the streams\r\naround refineries, offending human nostrils and killing helpless fish.\r\nThe amazing vastness of its development is equalled only by the\r\nmarvelous variety of petroleum’s commercial uses.\r\n\r\nAt every stage of its journey from the hole in the ground to the abode\r\nof the purchaser of kerosene, oil is handled with a view to the best\r\nresults. The pipe-line relieves the producer from worry and fatigue and\r\na large outlay, furnishing him prompt service and a cash market at his\r\nown door every business-day in the year. It enables the refiner to fill\r\nthe consumer’s lamp at a trifling margin above the price of crude. For\r\nseventy cents a barrel—less than half it cost formerly to haul it a\r\nmile—the line collects oil from the wells, pumps it into the trunk-lines\r\nand delivers it in New York. Contrast this charge with the four, five,\r\neight or ten dollars exacted in the days of boats and wagons, barrels\r\nand tank-cars and endeavor to figure the saving to the public wrought by\r\nthe pipe-lines, to say nothing of greater convenience and expedition.\r\nThe existing transportation-system may be a monopoly, but the country is\r\nhungry for more monopolies of the same sort. If it be monopoly to bring\r\norder out of chaos, to build one strong enterprise from a dozen\r\nweaklings, to consolidate into a grand corporation a score of feeble\r\nlines and reduce freight-rates seventy-five to ninety-five per cent.,\r\nthe National-Transit Company is the rankest monopoly of the century. It\r\npractices the kind of monopoly that converts a row of tottering shanties\r\ninto a stately business-block. It is guilty of furnishing storage solid\r\nas the Rock of Gibraltar to the men who drilled oil down to forty cents\r\na barrel and tiding them over the period of excessive production. This\r\nis the brand of monopoly that keeps industry alive, that supplies\r\nforeign nations with an American product and benefits humanity. If Van\r\nSyckle, Abbott and Harley were plucky and courageous in braving the\r\nwrath of four-thousand teamsters, how much more brain and brawn, muscle\r\nand money, dollars and sense were needed to lay trunk-lines that sent\r\nten-thousand tank-cars to the junk-pile and diminished the revenues of\r\nrailroads millions of dollars annually! The owners of these lines have\r\ngrown rich, as they ought to do, because for every dollar of their\r\nwinnings they have saved producers and consumers of petroleum ten.\r\n\r\nPipe-line certificates afforded an excellent medium for speculation. The\r\ncommodity they represented was subject to fluctuations of five to fifty\r\nper cent., which made it particularly fascinating to speculators in\r\nstocks. Oil-exchanges were established at Oil City, Titusville, Parker,\r\nBradford, Pittsburg, New York, Philadelphia and elsewhere. In a single\r\nyear the clearances exceeded eleven-billion barrels. Bulls and bears\r\nreveled in excitement and brokers had customers from every quarter of\r\nthe country. The forerunner of these institutions was “the Curbstone\r\nExchange” at Oil City in 1870. The bulk of the buying and selling was\r\ndone in front of Lockhart, Frew & Co.’s office, Centre street, near the\r\nrailroad track. Producers, dealers and spectators would congregate on\r\nthe sidewalk, discuss the situation, tell stories and buy or sell oil.\r\nThe group in the illustration includes a number of well-known citizens.\r\nMost of them have left Oil City and not a few have gone from earth.\r\nAcquaintances will recognize Dr. Knox, John Mawhinney, James Mawhinney,\r\nJohn D. Archbold, Dr. Baldwin, A. H. Bronson, P. H. Judd, L. D. Kellogg,\r\nA. E. Fay, George Porter, Edward Higbee, William M. Williams, John W.\r\nAustin, J. M. Butters, Joseph Bates, George W. Parker, William H.\r\nPorterfield, Charles W. Frazer, Edward Simmons, Samuel H. Lamberton,\r\nJames H. Magee, Isaac Lloyd and William Elliott. Charles Lockhart and\r\nWilliam Frew were pioneer refiners at Pittsburg and heavy buyers of\r\ncrude at Oil City. William G. Warden entered into partnership with them\r\nand established the great Atlantic Refinery at Point Breeze. In 1874 the\r\nrefineries controlled by Warden, Frew & Co. consolidated with the\r\nStandard Oil-Company of Ohio, forming the nucleus of the Standard\r\nOil-Trust. Mr. Warden built the Gladstone, the first large\r\napartment-house in Philadelphia, and died in April of 1895. He married a\r\ndaughter of Daniel Bushnell and was one of the most enterprising and\r\ncharitable citizens of Pennsylvania. His surviving contemporaries are\r\nold in reminiscences of Oil Creek and the days when pipe-lines and\r\noil-certificates were unguessed probabilities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OIL CITY “CURBSTONE EXCHANGE” IN 1870.]\r\n\r\nTrades were made in offices, at wells, on streets, anywhere and\r\neverywhere. Purchasers for Pittsburg, Baltimore and Philadelphia\r\nrefiners started brokerage in 1868, on a commission of ten cents a\r\nbarrel from buyers and five from sellers. The Farmers’ Railroad,\r\ncompleted to Oil City in 1867, brought so many operators to town that a\r\ncar was assigned them, in which they bought and sold “spot,” “regular”\r\nand “future oil.” There were no certificates, no written obligations, no\r\nmargins to bind a bargain, but everything was done on honor and no man’s\r\nword was broken. “Spot oil” was to be moved and paid for at once,\r\n“regular” allowed the buyer ten days to put the oil on the cars and\r\n“future” was taken as agreed upon mutually. Large lots frequently\r\nchanged hands in this passenger-car, really the first oil-exchange. The\r\nbusiness increased, an exchange on wheels had manifest disadvantages and\r\nin December of 1869 it was decided to effect a permanent organization.\r\nOfficers were elected and a room was rented on Centre street. It removed\r\nto the Sands Block in 1871, to the Opera-House Block in January of 1872\r\nand to a temporary shed next the Empire-Line office in the fall, when\r\nSouth-Improvement complications dissolved the organization. For about\r\nfifteen months hotels, streets, or offices sufficed for accommodations.\r\nIn February of 1864 the exchange was reorganized, with George V. Forman\r\nas president, and occupied quarters in the Collins House four years.\r\nGradually rules were adopted and methods introduced that brought about\r\nthe system afterwards in vogue. In April of 1878 the formal opening of\r\nthe splendid Oil-Exchange Building took place. The structure contained\r\noffices, committee-rooms, telegraph-lines, reading-rooms and all\r\nconveniences for its four-hundred members. H. L. Foster, now of Chicago,\r\nwas president term after term. The late H. L. McCance, secretary for\r\nyears, was a first-class artist, with a skill for caricature worthy of\r\nThomas Nast. Some of the most striking cartoons pertaining to oil were\r\nthe work of his ready pencil. F. W. Mitchell & Co. inaugurated the\r\nadvancing of money on certificates, their bank’s transactions in this\r\nline ranging from one to four-million dollars a day. The application of\r\nthe clearing-house system in 1882 simplified the routine and facilitated\r\ndeliveries. The volume of business was immense, the clearances often\r\namounting to ten or fifteen-million barrels a day. Only the New York and\r\nthe San Francisco stock-exchanges surpassed it. If speculation were\r\npiety, everybody who inhaled the air of Oil City would have been saved\r\nand the devil might have put up his shutters. During rapid fluctuations\r\nthe galleries would be packed with men and women who had “taken a flyer”\r\nand watched the antics of the bulls and bears intently. Fortunes were\r\ngained and lost. Many a “lamb” was shorn and many a “duck” lamed. It was\r\na raging fever, a delirium of excitement, compressing years of ordinary\r\nanxiety and haste into a week. Now the exchange is deserted and\r\nspeculative trade in oil is dead. Part of the big building is a\r\nclothier’s store and offices are rented for sleeping-apartments. Myer\r\nLowentritt, Stewart Simpson, “Eddie” Selden, Samuel Justus and a\r\nhalf-dozen others are seen occasionally, but days pass without a\r\nsolitary transaction, the surging crowds have vanished and activity is a\r\ndream of bygone years.\r\n\r\nParker had a lively oil-exchange when the Armstrong and Butler fields\r\nwere at their height. The most prominent men in speculative trade lived\r\nin the town or were represented in the exchange. Thomas B. Simpson was a\r\nlarge operator. George Darr was agent of Daniel Goettel, who once\r\nengineered the greatest bull-movement in the history of oil and was\r\nsupposed to have “cornered” the market. Charles Ball and Henry Loomis\r\nearned sixty-thousand dollars brokerage a year and died within a month\r\nof each other. Trade slackened and expired. The boys shifted to Bradford\r\nand Pittsburg and a constable sold the building to satisfy Mrs. W. H.\r\nSpain’s claim for ground-rent! The five-thousand-dollar library and the\r\ncostly pictures, dust-covered and neglected, sold for a trifle and went\r\nto South Oil City. A jollier, bigger-hearted crowd of fellows than the\r\nmembers of the Parker Exchange never played a practical joke or helped a\r\npoor sufferer out of “a deuce of a fix.”\r\n\r\nThe Bradford Oil-Exchange started on January first, 1883, with\r\nfive-hundred members and a forty-thousand-dollar building. Five-hundred\r\nothers, with Hon. David Kirk as president, organized the Producers’\r\nPetroleum-Exchange and erected a spacious brick-block, occupying it on\r\nJanuary second, 1884. Both exchanges whooped it up briskly, both have\r\nsubsided and the buildings are stores and offices. Titusville’s handsome\r\nexchange, on the site of the American Hotel, has gone the same road.\r\nCaptain Vandergrift built the Pittsburg Oil-Exchange, the finest of them\r\nall, fitting it up superbly. A bank and offices have succeeded the\r\nfestive dealers in crude. From the Mining-Stock Exchange, the\r\nMiscellaneous Security Board and several more of similar types the\r\nNew-York Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange developed a huge\r\nconcern, with twenty-four-hundred members and a lordly building—erected\r\nin 1887—on Broadway and Exchange Place. The membership was the largest\r\nin the country, with the exception of the Produce Exchange, and the\r\nbusiness in oil at times exceeded the transactions of the Stock\r\nExchange. Seats sold as high as three-thousand dollars. Charles G.\r\nWilson has been president since the organization of the Petroleum and\r\nStock Board, which absorbed the National Petroleum Exchange—L. H. Smith\r\nwas its president—and in 1885 adopted the elongated name that has\r\nburdened it eleven years. Oil is not mentioned once a week, because the\r\nstocks have declined to a skeleton and the certificates represent\r\nscarcely a half-million barrels. Philadelphia had an exchange of lesser\r\ndegree and a score of oil-region towns sharpened their appetite for\r\nspeculation by establishing branch-concerns and bucket-shops. The almost\r\nentire disappearance of the speculative trade is not the least\r\nremarkable feature of the petroleum-development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH SEEP.]\r\n\r\nSince the elimination of exchanges producers generally sell their oil in\r\nthe shape of credit-balances. For their convenience the Standard\r\nOil-Company has established purchasing-agencies throughout the region.\r\nThe quantity of crude to the credit of the seller on the pipe-line books\r\nis ascertained from the National-Transit office, a check is given and\r\nall the trouble the producer has is to draw his money from the bank. It\r\nis handier than a pocket in a shirt, easier than rolling off a log in a\r\nmill-pond, and the happy “victim of monopoly” goes on his way rejoicing\r\nafter the manner of Philip’s converted eunuch. If he reside at a\r\ndistance, be sojourning at Squedunk or in London, traveling with the\r\nCzar or showing the Prince of Wales a good time, a message to the agency\r\nwill deliver his oil to Harry Lewis and the cash to his own order in a\r\ntwinkling. The whole chain of purchasing-agencies is managed by Joseph\r\nSeep, whose headquarters are at Oil City. The Standard has the knack of\r\nselecting A-1 men for responsible positions—men who are not misfits,\r\nsquare pegs in round holes or small potatoes in the hill. Among the\r\ncapable thousands who represent the great corporation none is better\r\nadapted to his important place than the head of the purchasing-agencies.\r\nHe has the tact, the experience, the knowledge of human-nature and the\r\nstrength of character the position demands. For twenty-five years he has\r\npurchased crude for the company, up Oil Creek, at Oil City and down the\r\nAllegheny. You may not belong to his church or his party, you may differ\r\nfrom him on silver and woman-suffrage, you may even call the Standard an\r\n“octopus”—Col. J. A. Vera first did this at a meeting near St.\r\nPetersburg in 1874—and wish to turn its picture to the wall, but you\r\nlike “Joe” Seep for his candor, his manliness, his admirable blending of\r\nsuavity and firmness. He hails from the succulent blue-grass of\r\nKentucky, combines Southern ease and Northern vigor, lives at Titusville\r\nand enjoys his wealth. It would strain Chicago’s convention-hall to hold\r\nhis legions of friends. His heart and his purse are alike generous. He\r\nproduces oil, buys oil, ships oil and “pays the freight” on\r\nthree-fourths of the oil handled in Oildom. He and George Lewis and\r\nHarry Lewis—“match ’em if you can”—have bought enough oil to fill a sea\r\non which the navies of the world might race and leave room for the Yale\r\ncrew that crew too soon. Seep and the Lewises are the gilt-edged stripe\r\nof men who don’t drop banana-skins on the sidewalk to trip up a neighbor\r\nor squirm with envy because somebody else has a streak of good-luck.\r\nWhen Seep’s last shipment has been made, the account is closed and the\r\nRecording Angel’s ledger shows his big credit-balance, St. Peter will\r\n“throw the gates wide open,” bid him welcome and never think of\r\nspringing the old gag: “Not for Joseph, not for Joe!”\r\n\r\nSudden shifts in the market brought queer experiences in the days of\r\nwild oil-speculation, enriching some dabblers and impoverishing\r\nothers. Stories of gains and losses were printed in newspapers,\r\nrepeated in Europe and exaggerated at home and abroad. A bull-clique\r\nat Bradford, acting upon “tips from the inside,” dropped\r\nfour-hundred-thousand dollars in six months. An Oil-City producer\r\ncleared three-hundred-thousand one spring, loaded for a further rise\r\nand was bankrupted by the frightful collapse Cherry Grove ushered in.\r\nA Warren minister risked three-thousand dollars, the savings of his\r\nlifetime, which vanished in a style that must have taught him not to\r\nlay up treasures on earth. A Pittsburg cashier margined his own and\r\nhis grandmother’s hundred-thousand dollars. The money went into the\r\nwhirlpool and the old lady went to the poor-house. A young Warrenite\r\nput up five-hundred dollars to margin a block of certificates, kept\r\ndoubling as the price advanced and quit fifty-thousand ahead. He\r\nlooked about for a chance to invest, but the craze had seized him and\r\nhe hazarded his pile in oil. Cherry Grove swept away his fortune in a\r\nday. A Bradford hotel-keeper’s first plunge netted him a hundred\r\ndollars one forenoon. He thought that beat attending bar and haunted\r\nthe Producers’ Exchange persistently. He mortgaged his property in\r\nhope of calling the turn, but the sheriff raked in the pot and the\r\npoor landlord was glad to drive a beer-wagon. Such instances could be\r\nmultiplied indefinitely. Hundreds of producers lost in the maelstrom\r\nall the earnings of their wells, while the small losers would be like\r\nthe crowd John beheld in his vision on Patmos, “a great company whom\r\nno man can number.” Wages of drivers, pumpers, drillers, laborers and\r\nservant-girls were swallowed in the quicksands of the treacherous sea.\r\n\r\nOf course there were many winners and many happy strokes of fortune. In\r\n1876 Peter Swenk, of Ithaca, N. Y., purchased through a Parker broker\r\nten-thousand barrels at two dollars and left orders to buy five-thousand\r\nmore should the market break to one-seventy-five. Returning home, he was\r\ntaken violently ill and the market suddenly fell forty cents, five cents\r\nbelow his margins. The day was stormy and Swenk could obtain no reports\r\nexcept from Oil City, where the break was eight cents greater than at\r\nParker. The storm saved Swenk, although he did not know it for months,\r\nby crippling the wires and shutting off communication between Oil City\r\nand Parker the last hour of business. Concluding the margins were\r\nexhausted and the broker had sold the oil to save himself, Swenk went\r\nwest to start anew. Weeks after his departure his Ithaca friends\r\nreceived urgent telegrams from the broker at Parker. They forwarded the\r\nmessages, which informed him that, as the market stood, he was worth\r\nnineteen-thousand dollars and would be wise to sell. Swenk wired to\r\nclose the whole matter and started for Parker. The market jumped another\r\npeg just before the order to sell arrived and Swenk received\r\ntwenty-two-thousand dollars profits. He paid the broker double\r\ncommission, returned home and bought a splendid farm. The faithful\r\nbroker who managed this singular deal is now virtually a pauper at\r\nBradford and a slave of rum. Last time we met he staggered up to me, his\r\neyes bleared and his clothing in tatters, pressed my hand and said:\r\n“Gimme ten cents; I’m dying for a drink!”\r\n\r\nA big spurt in April of 1895 temporarily revived interest in\r\noil-speculations. Again the exchange at Oil City was thronged. Exciting\r\nscenes of former years were renewed as the price climbed ten cents a\r\nclip. It was refreshing after the long stagnation to see the pool once\r\nmore stirred to its depths. From one-ten on April fourth the price\r\nstrode to two-eighty on April seventeenth. Certificates were scarce and\r\ncredit-balances were snapped up eagerly. A few big winnings resulted,\r\nthen the reaction set in, the spasm subsided and matters resumed their\r\ncustomary quietude. Connected with this phenomenal episode the papers in\r\nMay told this breezy tale of “Bailey’s Jag Investment:”\r\n\r\n“C. J. Bailey, of Parkersburg, drew seventy-five-hundred dollars out\r\nof the Commercial Bank of Wheeling as the earnings of a\r\nthree-hundred-dollar investment, made involuntarily and unknowingly.\r\nBailey is a traveling salesman. A little less than a month ago he made\r\na trip through the West-Virginia oil-fields. At Sistersville he got in\r\nwith a crowd of oil-men, with the result that next day he had a big\r\nhead, a very poor recollection of what had happened and was\r\nthree-hundred dollars short, according to his memorandum-book. He\r\nwisely decided that the less publicity he gave his loss the better it\r\nwould be and kept still. On Friday he was coming to Wheeling on the\r\nOhio River Railroad, when a stranger approached him with:\r\n\r\n“‘You are J. C. Bailey, I believe.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ replied Bailey.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, you will find seven-thousand-five-hundred dollars to your credit\r\nin the Commercial Bank at Wheeling,’ replied the stranger. ‘I put it\r\nthere day before yesterday and was about to advertise for you.’\r\n\r\n“Bunco was the first thought of Bailey; but as the stranger did not ask\r\nfor any show of money and talked all right, he asked for an explanation.\r\nIt turned out that the stranger was one of the men with whom Bailey had\r\nbeen out in Sistersville. He was also secretary and treasurer of an\r\noil-company, which had struck a rich well in the back-country pool two\r\nweeks before. Bailey, while irresponsible, had put three-hundred dollars\r\ninto the company’s capital-stock, on the advice of his friends. Meantime\r\nthe well had been drilled, coming in a gusher of three-thousand barrels\r\na day, one-tenth of which belonged to Bailey on his three-hundred-dollar\r\ninvestment. Bailey came to Wheeling, went to the bank and found the\r\nmoney awaiting him. He drew five-thousand dollars to send to his wife.\r\nBailey’s good fortune is not over yet, for the well is a good producer\r\nand the company holds large leases, on which several more good wells are\r\nsure to be drilled.”\r\n\r\nWhat of the brokers and speculators? They are scattered like chaff. A\r\nthousand have “gone and left no sign.” President Foster, of the Oil City\r\nExchange, an accomplished musician, traveler and orator, is a Chicagoan.\r\nJohn Mawhinney, John S. Rich—the fire at Rouseville’s burning-well\r\nnearly destroyed his sight—H. L. McCance, George Cornwall, Wesley\r\nChambers, Dr. Cooper, A. D. Cotton, T. B. Porteous, Isaac Reineman, I.\r\nS. Gibson, Charles J. Fraser, W. K. Vandergrift, B. W. Vandergrift, B.\r\nF. Hulseman, Charles Haines, Michael Geary, Patrick Tiernan, “Shep”\r\nMoorhead, Melville, McCutcheon, Fullerton Parker, George Harley, Marcus\r\nBrownson and a host of other familiar figures will nevermore be seen in\r\nany earthly exchange. “Jimmy” Lowe—he was a telegrapher at first—Arthur\r\nLewis, M. K. Bettis, George Thumm, I. M. Sowers and a dozen more drifted\r\nto Chicago. “Dick” Conn, “Sam” Blakeley, Wade Hampton, “Rod” Collins,\r\nMajor Evans, Col. Preston and Charles W. Owston are residents of New\r\nYork. “Tom” McLaughlin buys oil for the Standard at Lima. “Ajax” Kline\r\nis dissecting the Tennessee field for the Forest Oil-Company. “Cal”\r\nPayne is Oil-City manager of the Standard’s gas-interests. “Tom”\r\nBlackwell is in Seep’s purchasing-agency. John J. Fisher is flourishing\r\nat Pittsburg. “Charley” Goodwin holds the fort at Kane. Daniel Goettel\r\nand W. S. McMullan are running a large lumber-plant in Missouri. O. C.\r\nSherman is a Baptist preacher and Jacob Goettel fills a Methodist\r\npulpit. Frank Ripley and “Fin” Frisbee are heavy-weights in Duluth\r\nreal-estate. C. P. Stevenson, the leading Bradford broker, dwells at his\r\nease on a plantation in North Carolina. B. F. Blackmarr lives at\r\nMeadville and “Billy” Nicholas is a citizen of Minneapolis. Some are in\r\nCalifornia, some in Alaska, some in Florida, some in Europe and two or\r\nthree in India. Go whither you may, it will be a cold day if you don’t\r\nstumble across somebody who belonged to an oil-exchange or had a cousin\r\nwhose husband’s brother-in-law knew a man who was acquainted with\r\nanother man who once saw a man who met an oil-broker. It is sad to think\r\nhow the capital fellows who juggled certificates at Oil City, Parker and\r\nBradford have thinned out and the pall of obliteration has been spread\r\nover the exchanges.\r\n\r\n                “So fallen! So lost! the light withdrawn\r\n                    Which once they wore,\r\n                The glory of their past has gone\r\n                    Forevermore!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST STEEL OIL-TANK STRUCK BY LIGHTNING, AT TITUSVILLE,\r\nJUNE 11, 1880.]\r\n\r\nA pretty girl might as well expect to escape admiring glances as\r\npetroleum to escape a fire occasionally. “Uncle Billy” Smith’s lantern\r\nignited the first tank at the Drake well and a long procession has\r\nfollowed in its smoky trail. The lantern-fiend has been a prolific cause\r\nof oil-conflagrations, boiling-over refinery-stills have not been slack\r\nin this particular, the cigarette with a fool at one end and a spark at\r\nthe other has done something in the same line, but lightning is the\r\nchampion tank-destroyer. The result of an electric-bolt and a tank of\r\ninflammable oil engaging in a debate may be imagined. At first tanks\r\nwere covered loosely with boards or wooden roofs. The gas formed a vapor\r\nwhich attracted lightning and kept up a large production of fires each\r\nseason. One vicious stroke cremated sixty tanks of oil at the Atlantic\r\nRefinery in 1883. In July and August of 1880, a quarter-million barrels\r\nof McKean crude went up by the lightning-route. On June eleventh, 1880,\r\na flash collided with the first _steel-tank_ on which lightning had ever\r\nexperimented and set the oil blazing. The tank was on a hill-side\r\nthree-hundred feet from the west bank of Oil Creek, at Titusville.\r\nSeveral houses and the Acme Refinery, located between it and the stream,\r\nwere consumed. While the burning oil flowed down the hill a sheet of\r\nsolid flame covered ten acres. Bursting tanks, exploding stills and\r\nburning oils were an unpleasant premonition of the red-hot hereafter\r\nprepared for the wicked. The fire raged three days with the fury of the\r\nfurnace heated sevenfold to give Shadrack, Meshach and Abed-nego a\r\nroast. The Titusville Battery checked it somewhat by cannonading the\r\ntanks with solid shot, which made holes that let the oil run into the\r\ncreek. This plan was tried successfully in Butler and McKean. The old\r\nlog-house that sheltered the generations of Campbells on the site of\r\nPetrolia met its fate by the firing of Taylor & Satterfield’s\r\ntwenty-thousand-barrel tank on the hill above, which fell a prey to\r\nlightning. Three tanks opposite the mouth of Bear Creek, below Parker,\r\nstood together and burned together, the one singed by Jupiter’s shaft\r\nsetting off its mates. The scene at night was of the grandest,\r\nmultitudes gathering to watch the huge waves of flame and dense clouds\r\nof smoke. As the oil burned down—just as it would consume in a lamp—the\r\ntank-plates would collapse and the blazing crude would overflow.\r\nThousands of barrels would pour into the Allegheny, covering the water\r\nfor a mile with flame and painting a picture beside which a volcanic\r\neruption resembled the pyrotechnics of a lucifer-match. Many tanks were\r\nburned prior to the use of close iron-roofs, which confine the gas and\r\ndo not offer special inducements to “the artillery of heaven” to score a\r\nhit. Of late years such fires have been rarities. All oil in the\r\npipe-line to which the burned tank belonged was assessed to meet the\r\namount lost. This was known as General Average, as unwelcome in oil as\r\nGeneral Apathy in politics, General Depression in business, General\r\nDislike in society or General Weyler in Cuba.\r\n\r\nGeorge B. Harris, a pioneer refiner, died at Franklin in January of\r\n1892, aged sixty years. A member of the firm of Sims & Co., he built the\r\nfirst or second refinery in Venango county, near the lower end of\r\nFranklin. He prospered for years, but reverses swept away his fortune\r\nand he was poor when death closed the scene.\r\n\r\nA party of young men from New England started a refinery on Oil Creek in\r\nthe sixties. Their industry, correct habits and attention to business\r\nattracted favorable notice. Mr. Trefts, of machinery fame, one day\r\nobserved to a friend: “You mark my words; some day these young men will\r\nbe rich and their names shall be a power in the land. I know it will be\r\nso from their industry and good habits.” This assertion was prophetic.\r\nThe young man at the head of that modest firm of young men was H. H.\r\nRogers, now president of the National-Transit Company. Speaking of his\r\nelection as supervisor of streets and highways at Fair Haven, a New-York\r\npaper indulged in this facetious pleasantry regarding Mr. Rogers:\r\n\r\n“The people of Fair Haven have done well. No man in New York or\r\nMassachusetts has had more experience with bad roads than Mr. Rogers, or\r\nhas met with more success in subduing them. When he first engaged in the\r\npetroleum-business on Oil Creek the highways there were rarely navigable\r\nfor anything on wheels, but were open to navigation by flat-boats most\r\nof the year. There was something in the mud of the oil-country at that\r\ntime which was sure death to the capillary glands. Hairless horses and\r\nmules were in the height of fashion. When Mr. Rogers arrived on the\r\nstrange scene, poling his way up to the hotel on a sawlog, he was at\r\nonce chosen road-supervisor. In a neat speech, which is still extant,\r\nMr. Rogers thanked the oil-citizens for the confidence reposed in him\r\nand then went to work. In the first place, he refined the mud of the\r\nhighways, taking from it all the merchantable petroleum and converting\r\nthe residue into stove-polish of an excellent quality. In the next\r\nplace, he constructed pipe-lines, through which the oil was conveyed,\r\nthus keeping it out of the middle of the road, and to-day there is a\r\nboulevard along Oil Creek that is hardly surpassed by the Appian Way.\r\nHorses are again covered with hair and happiness sits smiling at every\r\nhearthstone. The people of Fair Haven have a superintendent of streets\r\nto whom they can point with pride.”\r\n\r\nDr. J. W. James, of Brady’s Bend, who drilled some of the first wells\r\naround Oil City and was largely interested in the Armstrong and Bradford\r\nfields, in 1858 had a plant near Freeport for extracting coal-oil from\r\nshale. At a cost of twelve cents a gallon it produced crude-petroleum,\r\nwhich the company refined partially and sold at a dollar to\r\none-twenty-five. The oil obtained from the rocks by drilling and that\r\ndistilled from the shale were the same chemically. Dr. James read\r\nmedicine with Dr. F. J. Alter, who constructed a telegraph Morse\r\njourneyed from the east to see before perfecting his own device. Dr.\r\nAlter’s line extended only from the house about the small yard and back\r\nto his study. Full of enthusiasm over its first performance, he cried\r\nout to his student, young James: “I believe I could make this thing work\r\na distance of six miles!” Bell’s first telephone—a cord stretched\r\nbetween two apple-trees in an orchard at Brantford, Canada—was equally\r\nsimple and its results have been scarcely less important.\r\n\r\nJohn J. Fisher bought the first thousand barrels of oil in the new\r\nexchange at Oil City, on April twenty-third, 1878. Probably the largest\r\npurchase was by George Lewis, who took from a syndicate of brokers a\r\nblock of two-hundred-thousand barrels. The first offer was\r\nfifty-thousand, increasing ten-thousand until it quadrupled, with the\r\nobject of having Lewis cry: “Hold! Enough!” Lewis wasn’t to be bluffed\r\nand he merely nodded at each addition to the lot until the other fellow\r\nweakened, the crowd watching the pair breathlessly. “Sam” Blakeley, the\r\nmost eccentric genius in the aggregation, once bid at Parker for a\r\nmillion barrels. Nobody had that quantity to sell and he advanced the\r\nbid five cents above the quotations. There was not a response and he\r\noffered a million barrels five cents below the ruling price, toying with\r\nthe market an hour as if it were a foot-ball. He played for big stakes,\r\nbut none knew who backed him. Coming to Oil City, he reported the market\r\nfor the _Derrick_ and cut up lots of shines. One morning he looked glum,\r\noil had tumbled and “Sam” hired an engine to whirl him to Corry. By\r\nnightfall he landed in Canada and his oil was sold to square his account\r\nin the clearing-house. An hour after his flight William Brough came up\r\nfrom Franklin to take the oil and carry “Sam” over the drop. In the\r\nafternoon a sudden rise set in, which would have left Blakeley\r\ntwenty-thousand dollars profit had he stayed at his post! That was the\r\ntime “Sam” didn’t do “the great kibosh,” as he phrased it. For years he\r\nhas been hanging around New York. He was one of the boys distinguished\r\nas high-rollers and extinguished before the shuffle ended.\r\n\r\nTelegraph-operators and messenger-boys at the oil-exchanges learned to\r\nnote the movements of leading speculators and profit thereby. Some of\r\nthem, with more hope of gain than fear of loss, beginning in a small way\r\nby risking a few dollars in margins, coined money and entered the ring\r\non their own account. “Jimmy” Lowe, one of the biggest brokers at Parker\r\nand Oil City, slung lightning for the Western-Union when the Oil-City\r\nExchange needed the services of twenty operators and scores of\r\nmessenger-boys. Among the latter was “Jim” Keene, the Franklin broker.\r\nHe and John Bleakley often received fifty cents or a dollar for\r\ndelivering a message to “Johnnie” Steele, who stopped at the Jones House\r\nand flew high during his visits to Oil City. Steele and Seth Slocum\r\nwould dash through the mud on their black chargers, dressed in the\r\nloudest style and sporting big diamonds. These halcyon times have passed\r\naway and the oil-exchanges have departed. “The glories of our mortal\r\nstate are shadows.”\r\n\r\nIn January of 1894 the Producers’ and Refiners’ Oil-Company erected an\r\niron-tank on the hill south-east of Titusville. Lightning destroyed the\r\ntank and its contents in May. The second tank was built on the spot in\r\nOctober and on June twelfth, 1895, lightning struck a tree beside it.\r\nThe burning tree fired the gas and the tank and oil perished. The site\r\nis still vacant, the company deciding not to give the electric fluid a\r\nchance for a third strike.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. N. Yost, who died in New York last year, was once the largest\r\noil-buyer and shipper in the region. He lived at Titusville and removed\r\nto Corry, where he built the Climax Mower and Reaper Works, a church, a\r\nhandsome residence and blocks of dwellings. Patents of different kinds\r\nrecouped losses in manufacturing. With Mr. Densmore, of Meadville, he\r\nbrought out the caligraph. Yost sold to his partner and developed the\r\nYost Typewriter, organized the American Writing-Machine Company and\r\nfitted up the shops at Bridgeport, Connecticut, used to manufacture\r\nSharp’s rifles during the border-troubles in Kansas. Mr. Yost was a man\r\nof striking personality and unflagging energy. He became a strong\r\nspiritualist and believed a medium, to whom he submitted completely, put\r\nhim in communication with his dead relatives and recorded their thoughts\r\non his typewriter.\r\n\r\nThe men of the oil-region have ever been noted for their commercial\r\nhonor. It passed into a proverb—“honor of oil.“ The spirit of the\r\nsaying, “his word is as good as his bond,” has always been lived up to\r\nmore closely in Oildom than in any other section of the country. The\r\nforce of business-obligation ran high in the exchanges and among the\r\nearly dealers in crude. Transactions involving hundreds-of-thousands of\r\ndollars occurred every day, without a written bond or a scrap of paper\r\nsave a pencil-entry in a memorandum-book. Certificates were borrowed and\r\nloaned in this way and the idea of shirking a verbal contract was never\r\nthought of. The celerity with which property thus passed from man to man\r\nwas one of the striking features of business in the bustling world of\r\npetroleum. And the record is something to be proud of in these days of\r\nembezzlements, defalcations, breaches of trust and commercial deviltry\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nThe average tank-steamer carries about two-million gallons of oil in\r\nbulk across the Atlantic. In addition to this fleet of steamers, scores\r\nof sailing vessels, under charter of the Orient, France, Italy and\r\nforeign countries, load cases and barrels of refined-oil for transport\r\nto European ports. American wooden-ships are chartered sometimes to\r\nconvey oil to Japan. Thus Russian competition is met through the\r\ninstrumentality of pipe-lines to the coast and transportation by water\r\nto points many thousand miles away from the wells that produced the oil.\r\n\r\nThe production of crude-petroleum in the United States in 1895,\r\naccording to the statistics compiled for the Geological Survey by Joseph\r\nD. Weeks, was fifty-three-million barrels, valued at fifty-eight-million\r\ndollars. For 1894 the figures were fifty-million barrels and\r\nthirty-five-million dollars respectively. All districts except West\r\nVirginia and New York shared in the increase. The total\r\nproduction from the striking of the Drake well in 1859 to\r\nthe end of 1895 was seven-hundred-and-ten-million barrels.\r\nFive-hundred-and-seventeen-million barrels of this enormous aggregate\r\nrepresent the yield of the Pennsylvania and New-York oil-fields. Who\r\nsays petroleum isn’t a big thing?\r\n\r\nAt Pittsburg you can easily gather a little group of men, such as\r\nCharles Lockhart and Captain Vandergrift, who recall the time when the\r\nTarentum petroleum was termed “a mysterious grease.” They had a hand in\r\nhandling it when the oil had no commercial name. They watched Samuel M.\r\nKier’s efforts to give it a commercial name and a marketable value. They\r\nsaw it run to waste at first, they remember paying a dollar a gallon for\r\nit and can tell all about Drake’s visit to Tarentum. They hold their\r\nbreath when they think of the gold that changed hands in Venango county\r\nafter “Uncle Billy” Smith bored the seventy-foot hole below Titusville,\r\nof the wonderful spread of operations and the dazzling progress of the\r\ncommodity once despised. They noted the flow of petroleum toward\r\nEurope—how forty casks were sent to France in 1860 as a curiosity and\r\nthirty-nine-hundred in 1863 as a commercial venture. They have seen this\r\n“mysterious grease,” that used to flow into the Pennsylvania Canal,\r\nlight the world from the Pyramids of Egypt to the salons of Paris, from\r\nthe shores of Palestine to the Chinese Wall. They have seen the four\r\nsalt-and-oil wells at Tarentum and the solitary oil-well at Titusville\r\nmultiplied into a hundred-thousand holes drilled for petroleum and a\r\nproduction almost beyond calculation. Do the gentlemen composing this\r\nlittle group occupy a position dramatic in the marvelous events they\r\nreview? Is petroleum freighted with interest and a touch of romance at\r\nevery step of its passage from the well to the lamp?\r\n\r\n                           MERELY DROPPED IN.\r\n\r\n         To big oil-wells a man may be a claimant,\r\n         From the sand-rock take in enormous payment,\r\n         Yet all he gets on earth is food and raiment.\r\n\r\n             The good well is the humble bee\r\n               With honey on its wings;\r\n             The dry-hole is the bumble-bee\r\n               That buzzes loud and stings.\r\n\r\n         Oilmen who run in debt, despite their rapid talk,\r\n         Not very often come out faster than a walk.\r\n\r\n         Uneasy lies the face that wears a frown;\r\n         No wonder, at the rate crude-oil goes down.\r\n\r\n “What are your favorite books?” the gushing damsel cried;\r\n “Bank-books and pocket-books,” the oilman quick replied.\r\n\r\n         Idle gossip? Oh, no, that isn’t right,\r\n         For gossip keeps on working day and night,\r\n         Beating a flowing oil-well out of sight.\r\n\r\n The driller mutter’d, as he stagger’d with unsteady gait,\r\n “There is no evil mixture here, I took my whisky straight.”\r\n\r\n               Of all uncertain kinds of biz\r\n               An oilman’s most uncertain is;\r\n               To-day, perhaps, his anguish’d soul\r\n               Laments because of a dry-hole;\r\n               He tries again, and who can tell\r\n               But he may strike a flowing-well?\r\n\r\n Sound money? Yes indeed; no oilman has a doubt\r\n The coin that jingles is the “soundest” money out.\r\n\r\n               Who with himself is satisfied\r\n                   Wants little here below;\r\n               He has a small excuse for pride,\r\n               For if the third-sand once he tried\r\n                   He might find a poor show.\r\n\r\n The fabric of the clothing may not wear a little bit,\r\n But the clothier’s fabrications will outlast Berea grit.\r\n\r\n “Pay as you go.” We will, for all the oilmen know\r\n All men _must_ pay the debt of nature as they go.\r\n\r\n               The gusher and the duster\r\n                 May be on one town-plot,\r\n               Angels and devils muster\r\n                 Upon the self-same lot,\r\n               And sobs and smiles may cluster\r\n                 Like flies on one bald spot.\r\n               Rare goodness and tough badness\r\n                 May come from the same shank,\r\n               Twin-links of grief and gladness\r\n                 Be issued by one bank,\r\n               For tears of joy and sadness\r\n                 Still flow from the same tank.\r\n\r\n “A rolling stone gathers no moss,” for trying junctures\r\n           May some wildcatters fit;\r\n But then it is the rolling wheel that gathers punctures,\r\n           Which makes the old saw nit.\r\n\r\n         Be not a spouting well that keeps an endless flow;\r\n         It isn’t always wise to tell all that you know,\r\n         But all you tell be mighty sure it’s truly so.\r\n\r\n         “Young Luckyboy made fifty-thousand plunks\r\n               From one small can of crude,”\r\n         The oilman said, while silence lay in chunks;\r\n               “I pray don’t think me rude”—\r\n         A list’ner spoke—“It strikes me you’re a man\r\n               Must practice on the lyre.”\r\n         The oilman smil’d: “His rich aunt used the can\r\n               To hurry up the fire!”\r\n\r\n He put the glycerine to thaw, the water was too hot,\r\n The stuff let go; it was the man, and not the well, was shot.\r\n\r\n “No!” said the oilman’s daughter, when young Dudelet sought her hand,\r\n “You may have lots of money, but you haven’t got the sand.”\r\n\r\n Why are proof-readers needed, those careless printers’ terrors?\r\n Because our first impressions are often full of errors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CLUSTER OF PIONEER EDITORS.]\r\n\r\nCOL.

HARRY LEIGH YEWENS.]\r\n\r\nThirty-seven years have had their entrances and their exits since Col.\r\nDrake’s little operation on Oil Creek played ducks and drakes with\r\nlard-oil lamps and tallow-dips. That seventy-foot hole on the flats\r\nbelow Titusville gave mankind a queer variety of things besides the best\r\nlight on “this grain of sand and tears we call the earth.” With the\r\nilluminating blessing enough wickedness and jollity were mixed up to\r\nknock out Sodom and Gomorrah in one round. The festive boys who painted\r\nthe early oil-towns red are getting gray and wrinkled, yet they smile\r\nclear down to their boots as they think of Petroleum Centre, Pithole,\r\nBabylon, or any other of the rapid places which shed a lurid glare along\r\nin the sixties. The smile is not so much on account of flowing wells and\r\nsix-dollar crude as because of the rollicking scenes which carmined the\r\npioneer-period of Petroleum. These were the palmy days of unfathomable\r\nmud, swearing teamsters, big barrels, high prices, abundant cash and\r\neasy morals, when men left their religion and dress-suits “away out in\r\nthe United States.” The air was redolent of oil and smoke and\r\nnaughtiness, but there was no lack of hearty kindness and the sort of\r\ncharity that makes the angels want to flap their wings and give “three\r\ncheers and a tiger.” Even as the city destroyed by fire from heaven\r\nboasted one righteous person in the shape of Lot, whose wife was turned\r\ninto a pillar of salt for being too fresh, so the busy Oil-Dorado had a\r\nhost of capital fellows, true as steel, bright as a dollar and\r\n“quicker’n greas’d lightnin’!” Braver, better, nobler, squarer men never\r\ndoffed a tile to a pretty girl or elevated a heavy boot to the\r\ncoat-tails of a scoundrel. About the well, on the streets, in stores and\r\noffices could be found gallant souls attracted from the ends of the\r\nworld by glowing pictures—real oil-paintings—of huge fortunes gained in\r\na twinkling. Ministers, lawyers, doctors, merchants, soldiers,\r\nprofessors, farmers, mechanics and members of every industry were\r\nneither few nor far between in the exciting scramble for “the root of\r\nall evil.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WILL S. WHITAKER.       ROBERT LACY COCHRAN.\r\n  ALBERT PAWLING WHITAKER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo keep matters straight and slake the thirst for current literature\r\nnewspapers were absolutely necessary. Going back to 1859, the eventful\r\nyear that brought petroleum to the front, Venango county had three\r\nweeklies. The oldest of these was the _Spectator_, established at\r\nFranklin in 1849, by Albert P. Whitaker. At the goodly age of\r\nseventy-eight he wielded a vigorous pen and died in February, 1897. A\r\nzealous disciple of Izaak Walton and Thomas Jefferson, he could hook a\r\nfish or indite a pungent editorial with equal dexterity. He was an\r\nencyclopedia of political lore and racy stories. His _Spectator_ was no\r\nidle spectator of passing incidents. In 1851 Col. James Bleakley,\r\nsubsequently a prosperous producer and banker, secured an interest,\r\nselling it in 1853 to R. L. Cochran, who soon became sole proprietor and\r\npublished the paper seven years. Mr. Cochran took an active part in\r\npolitics and agriculture and exerted wide influence. A keen, incisive\r\nwriter and entertaining talker, with the courage of his convictions and\r\nthe good of the public at heart, his sterling qualities inspired\r\nconfidence and respect. Probably no man in Northwestern Pennsylvania had\r\na stronger personal following. The _Spectator_ flourished like a prize\r\nsunflower under his tactful management. It printed the first “oil\r\nreport,” giving a list of wells drilling and rigs up or building in the\r\nspring of 1860. Desiring to engage in banking, R. L. Cochran sold the\r\npaper to A. P. Whitaker, its founder, and C. C. Cochran. The latter\r\nretiring in 1861, Whitaker played a lone hand three years, when the two\r\nCochrans again purchased the establishment. A. P. Whitaker and his son,\r\nJohn H., a first-class printer, bought it back in 1866 and ran the\r\nconcern four years. Then the elder Whitaker once more dropped out,\r\nreturning in 1876 and resuming entire control a year later, which closed\r\nthe shuttlecock-changes of ownership that had been in vogue for\r\ntwenty-five years. Will S. Whitaker, an accomplished typo and twice the\r\nnominee of his party for mayor, had long assisted his father in\r\nconducting the staunch exponent of unadulterated Democracy. Col.\r\nBleakley passed away in 1884, leaving a fine estate as a monument of his\r\nsuccessful career. He built the Bleakley Block, founded the\r\nInternational Bank, served as City Councilman and was partner in 1842-4\r\nof John W. Shugert in the publication of the _Democratic Arch_, noted\r\nfor aggressiveness and sarcasm. John H. Whitaker died in Tennessee years\r\nago. R. L. Cochran was killed in June, 1893, on his farm in Sugarcreek\r\nTownship, by the accidental discharge of a gun. The paper began regular\r\n“oil-reports” in 1862, prepared by Charles C. Duffield, now of\r\nPittsburg, who would go up the Allegheny to Warren and float down in a\r\nskiff, stopping at the wells. P. J. Donahoe is the present editor and\r\nproprietor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. HARRISON SMITH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWIN W. SMILEY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. HOWARD SMILEY.]\r\n\r\nCharles Pitt Ramsdell, a school-teacher from Rockland Township, started\r\nthe _American Citizen_ at Franklin in 1855. Sent to the Legislature in\r\n1858, he sold the healthy chick to William Burgwin and Floyd C.\r\nRamsdell, removed to Delaware and settled in Virginia a few years before\r\nhis lamented death from wounds inflicted by an enraged bull. J. H. Smith\r\nacquired Ramsdell’s interest in 1861. The new partners made a strong\r\nteam in journalistic harness for three years, selling in 1864 to Nelson\r\nB. Smiley. He changed the title to _Venango Citizen_. Mr. Burgwin\r\nreposes in the Franklin cemetery. Mr. Smith carries on the book-trade,\r\nhis congenial pursuit for three decades, and is a regular contributor to\r\nthe religious press. Alexander McDowell entered into partnership with\r\nSmiley, buying the entire “lock, stock and barrel” in 1867. His former\r\nassociate studied law, practiced with great credit and died at Bradford.\r\nMajor McDowell, now a banker at Sharon—the number of Venango editors who\r\nblossomed into financiers ought to stimulate ambitious quill-drivers—was\r\na daisy in the newspaper-lay. His liberality and geniality won hosts of\r\nwarm friends. He tried his hand at politics and was chosen\r\nCongressman-at-Large in 1892, with Galusha A. Grow as running-mate, and\r\nClerk of the House in 1895. A prime joker, he bears the blame—if it be\r\nblameable to have done so—of introducing Pittsburg stogies to guileless\r\nmembers of Congress for the fun of seeing the victims cut pigeon-wings\r\ndoing a sea-sick act. Col. J. W. H. Reisinger purchased the outfit in\r\n1869, guiding the helm skilfully fifteen months. April first—the day had\r\nno special significance in this case—1870, E. W. Smiley, the present\r\nowner and cousin of Nelson B., succeeded Reisinger. The Colonel located\r\nat Meadville, where he has labored ably in the journalistic field for a\r\nquarter-century. Mr. Smiley steered his craft adroitly, usually “bobbing\r\nup serenely” on the winning side. He is a shrewd Republican worker and\r\nfor twenty years has filled a Senate-clerkship efficiently. What he\r\ndoesn’t know about the inside movements of state and local politics\r\ncould be jumped through the eye of a needle. His right-bower in running\r\nthe _Citizen-Press_—the hyphenated name was flung to the breeze in\r\n1884—is his son, J. Howard Smiley, a rising young journalist. The paper\r\ntoes the mark handsomely, has loads of advertising and does yeoman\r\nservice for its party. The _Daily Citizen_, the first daily in Oildom,\r\nexpired on the last day of 1862, after a brief existence of ten issues.\r\nA fit epitaph might be Wordsworth’s couplet:\r\n\r\n                   “Since it was so quickly done for,\r\n                   Wonder what it was begun for.”\r\n\r\nLater newspaper ventures at Franklin were refreshingly plentiful. In\r\nJanuary, 1876, Hon. S. P. McCalmont launched _The Independent Press_\r\nupon the stormy sea of journalism. It was a trenchant, outspoken,\r\ncall-a-spade-a-spade advocate of the Prohibition cause, striking\r\nresolutely at whoever and whatever opposed its temperance platform. Mr.\r\nMcCalmont wrote the editorials, which bristled with sharp, merciless,\r\nunsparing excoriations of the rum-traffic and its aiders and abettors.\r\nThe paper was worthy of its name and its spirited owner. Neither\r\ntruckled for favors, cringed for patronage or ever learned to “crook the\r\npregnant hinges of the knee where thrift may follow fawning.” Beginning\r\nlife a poor boy, S. P. McCalmont toiled on a farm, taught school,\r\ndevoured books, read law and served in the Legislature. For nearly fifty\r\nyears he has enjoyed a fine practice which brought him well-earned\r\nreputation and fortune. Ranking with the foremost lawyers of the state\r\nin legal attainments and professional success, he does his own thinking,\r\ndeclines to accept his opinions at second-hand and is a first-rate\r\nsample of the industrious, energetic, self-reliant American. By way of\r\nrecreation he works a half-dozen farms, a hundred oil-wells, a big\r\nrefinery and a coal-mine or two. James R. Patterson, Miss Sue Beatty and\r\nWill. S. Whitaker held positions on the _Press_. Mr. Patterson is\r\nfarming near Franklin and Mr. Whitaker managed the _Spectator_. Miss\r\nBeatty, a young lady of rare culture, was admitted to the bar recently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: S. P. M’CALMONT.]\r\n\r\nThe Independent Press-Association bought the _Press_ in 1879. This\r\ninfluential body comprised twelve stockholders, Hon. William R.\r\nCrawford, Hon. C. W. Gilfillan, Hon. John M. Dickey, Hon. Charles\r\nMiller, Hon. Joseph C. Sibley, Hon. S. P. McCalmont, Hon. Charles W.\r\nMackey, James W. Osborne, W. D. Rider, E. W. Echols, B. W. Bredin and\r\nIsaac Reineman, whom a facetious neighbor happily termed “the twelve\r\napostles, limited.” They enlarged the sheet to a nine-column folio,\r\ndiscarded the bourgeois skirt with long-primer trimmings for a tempting\r\ndress of minion and nonpareil and engaged J. J. McLaurin as editor. H.\r\nMay Irwin, the second editor under the new administration, filled the\r\nbill capably until the _Press_ and the _Citizen_ buried the hatchet and\r\nblended into one. Mr. Irwin is not excelled as an architect of graceful,\r\nfelicitous paragraphs on all sorts of subjects, “from grave to gay, from\r\nlively to severe.” He possesses in eminent degree the enviable faculty\r\nof saying the right thing in the right way, tersely, pointedly and\r\nattractively. The _Press_ was a model of neatness, newsiness and\r\nthorough editing, with a taste for puns and plays on words that added\r\nzest to its columns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. BEECHER KANTNER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES B. BORLAND.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES B. MUSE.]\r\n\r\nJames B. Borland’s _Evening News_ appeared in February, 1878, as an\r\namateur-daily about six by nine inches. The small seed quickly grew to a\r\nlusty plant. James B. Muse became a partner, enlargements were\r\nnecessary, and to-day the News is a seven-column folio, covering the\r\nhome-field and deservedly popular. Muse retired in 1880, H. May Irwin\r\nbuying his share and editing the wide-awake paper in capital style.\r\n_Every Evening_, a creditable venture by Frank Truesdell, E. E.\r\nBarrackman and A. G. McElhenny, bloomed every evening from July, 1878,\r\nto the following March. H. B. Kantner, a versatile specimen, hatched out\r\nthe _Morning Star_, Franklin’s only morning daily, in 1880. It shone\r\nseveral months and then set forever and ever. Kantner drifted to\r\nColorado. The _Herald_, the _Penny Press_ and _Pencil and Shears_\r\nwriggled a brief space and “fell by the wayside.” Samuel P. Brigham, an\r\naspiring young lawyer, edited the one-cent _Press_ and stirred up a\r\nhornet’s nest by fiercely assailing the water-works system and raising\r\nHail Columbia generally. He is at the head of a newspaper in the Silver\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe third weekly Venango boasted in 1859 was the _Allegheny-Valley\r\nEcho_, published at Emlenton by Peter O. Conver, a most erratic,\r\npicturesque genius. Learning the printing-trade in Franklin, the\r\nanti-slavery agitation attracted him to Kansas in 1852. He established a\r\npaper at Topeka, which intensified the excitement a man of Conver’s\r\ntemperament was not calculated to allay, and it soon climbed the golden\r\nstair. Other experiments shared the same fate, going to the dogs in\r\nshort metre. Conver roamed around the wild, woolly west several years,\r\nreturned to Venango county and perpetrated the _Echo_ in the fall of\r\n1858. At intervals a week passed without any issue, which the next\r\nnumber would attribute to the sudden departure of the “jour,” the\r\nnon-arrival of white paper, or the absence of the irrepressible Peter on\r\na convivial lark. Sparkling witticisms and “gems of purest ray”\r\nfrequently adorned the pages of the sheet, although sometimes\r\ntransgressing the rules of propriety. It was the editor’s habit to set\r\nup his articles without a manuscript. He would go to the case and put\r\nhis thoughts into type just as they emanated from his fertile brain.\r\nPoetry, humor, satire, invective, comedy, pathos, sentiment and\r\nphilosophy bunched their hits in a medley of clean-cut originality not\r\neven “John Phœnix” could emulate. The printer-editor had a fund of\r\nanecdotes and adventures picked up during his wanderings and an off-hand\r\nmagnetism that insured his popularity. His generosity was limited only\r\nby his pocket-book. Altogether he was a bundle of strange\r\ncontradictions, “whose like we shall not look upon again,” big-hearted,\r\nimpatient of denial, heedless of consequences, indifferent to praise or\r\nblame, sincere in his friendships and with not an atom of sham or\r\nhypocrisy in his manly fiber. He enlisted in the Fourth Pennsylvania\r\nCavalry when the war broke out, serving gallantly to the close of the\r\nstruggle at Appomattox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACOB WENK.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COL. J. W. H. REISINGER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL P. BRIGHAM]\r\n\r\nR. F. Blair, who had taken the _Echo_ in 1861, disposed of it in 1863 to\r\nJ. W. Smullin, by whom the materials were removed to Oil City. Walter L.\r\nPorter’s _Rising Sun_, W. R. Johns’ _Messenger_, Needle & Crowley’s\r\n_Register_, P. McDowell’s _News_, Col. Sam. Young’s _Telegraph_, Hulings\r\n& Moriarty’s _Times_ and Gouchler Brothers’ _Critic_ in turn flitted\r\nacross the Emlenton horizon. E. H. Cubbison exploited the _Home News_ in\r\n1885 and it is still holding the fort.\r\n\r\nGetting back from the war safe and sound, Conver pitched his tent at\r\nTionesta in 1866 and generated the _Forest Press_. Its peculiar\r\nmotto—“The first and only paper printed in Forest county and about the\r\nonly paper of the kind printed anywhere”—indicated the novel stripe of\r\nthis unique weekly. The crowning feature was its department of\r\n“Splinters,” which included the weird creations of the owner’s vivid\r\nfancy. The _Press_, after running smoothly a dozen years, did not long\r\nsurvive its eccentric, gifted proprietor, who answered the final\r\nroll-call in the spring of 1878, meeting death unflinchingly. He wrote a\r\nshort will and asked Samuel D. Irwin, his trusted adviser, to prepare\r\nhis obituary, “sense first, nonsense afterwards.” The _Bee_, which Col.\r\nReisinger hived in 1867, sipped honey a season and flew away. J. B.\r\nMuse’s _Vindicator_ and Jacob Wenk’s _Republican_ occupy the field. Mrs.\r\nConver left Tionesta and died in the west. Hosts of old friends who knew\r\nand understood Peter O. Conver will be glad to see his characteristic\r\nportrait, from a photograph treasured by Judge Proper, and “a nosegay of\r\nculled flowers” from his inimitable _Press_, “rugged as a jog over a\r\nstubble-field:”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PETER O. CONVER.]\r\n\r\n“That marble slab has arrived at last. Our own beautiful slab, with its\r\npolished surface, was manufactured expressly to our order, on which to\r\nimpose the forms of the Forest _Press_, a fit emblem and unmistakable\r\nevidence of the almost unparalleled success of an enterprise started in\r\nthe very hell of the season and circumstances on a one-horse load of\r\nold, good-for-nothing, worn-out, rotten and “bottled” material, taken in\r\npayment, etc., and a will to succeed. After we shall have fulfilled our\r\nmission through the _Press_ and have done with the things of earth, that\r\nsame slab can be used by the weeping “devils” on which to dance a\r\ngood-bye to us and our sins, after which they may inscribe with burning\r\ncharcoal on its polished surface, in letters of transient darkness:\r\n\r\n                    ‘Here\r\n                         lies\r\n                             Pete.\r\n                                  The\r\n                                     old\r\n                                        cuss\r\n                                            is\r\n                                              dead.’\r\n\r\n“Our mother was a Christian, the best friend we had, and the name of her\r\ntruant son—your servant—was the last she uttered. We are not a\r\nChristian, but when convinced we should be we will be. Never intend to\r\nmarry or die, if we can help it. In brief, we are a white Indian.”\r\n\r\n“A promissory-note is tuning the fiddle before the performance.”\r\n\r\n“A man suffering from dyspepsia sees nothing bright in the noonday-sun.\r\nAnother with a rusty liver looks upon a flower-garden as so many weeds.\r\nAnother with nerves at angles sees nothing lovely in the most beautiful\r\nwoman. Another with a disordered stomach can utter no word not tinged\r\nwith acid and fire.”\r\n\r\n“Smiles are among the cheapest and yet richest luxuries of life. We do\r\nnot mean the mere retraction of the lips and the exhibition of two rows\r\nof masticators—mastiffs, hyenas and the like amiabilities are proficient\r\nin that. We do not mean the cold, formal smile of politeness, that plays\r\nover the features like moonlight on a glacier—automatons and villains\r\ncan do that, but we mean the real, genial smile that breaks right out of\r\nthe heart, like a sunbeam out of a cloud, and lights up the whole face\r\nand shines straight into another heart that loves it or needs it.”\r\n\r\n“Ravishingly rich and gorgeous is our surrounding scenery smiling down\r\nupon us in all the dying glory of these autumn days, like the summery\r\nlandscape in childhood’s dreams, impressed on the heart but not\r\ndescribed; like the soul-beam of a good old person passing away. View\r\nall the grand and beautiful scenes of earth with the aid of\r\nimagination’s pencil if you please, and them come to Tionesta in October\r\nand behold the masterpiece. It is the finishing touch of beauty from the\r\nMaster Hand, imparting joy and faith and hope and resignation to the\r\nheart of man, which no human pen or pencil may copy and combinations of\r\nwords have not been discovered to describe; in fact, we have almost come\r\nto the conclusion that he who attempts it is a presuming fool, because\r\nthere’s no language in the dictionary or even invented by the poet to\r\nthat effect. But if we only live till the sun shines to-morrow, on such\r\nanother day as this, we’ll dig our potatoes, from which patch we can\r\nobtain mountain views on every hand alongside of which the Rocky\r\nMountains would appear overgrown and unnatural and Alpine scenery\r\nworn-out.”\r\n\r\n“The first great damper that threw cold water on the Fourth of July was,\r\nperhaps, the agitation of the temperance question; then the\r\nSunday-school celebrations gave a mortal blow to its ancient prestige\r\nand glory, until now, alas! it has been entirely eclipsed. Bantlings of\r\nthe third generation are soaring aloft in place of the old gray bird,\r\nniggers dancing jubas over the heads of their imperial masters and,\r\ngreat heavens! the very whiskey that we drink at $3 to $7 a gallon in\r\nmortal jeopardy. But, seriously speaking, we are in favor of every one\r\nfollowing the bent of his or her own inclination in celebrating things.\r\nNext week will be our usual occasion for getting full, unless we should\r\naccompany a very beautiful young lady hunting, in either of which events\r\nthe _Press_ may also have a celebration of its own and not appear in\r\npublic on any stage.”\r\n\r\n“Lieut. Samuel D. Irwin is a rare, original genius, a companion of our\r\nboyhood, whose life has been lively and stirring as our own in some\r\nrespects. He is also a candidate for District Attorney.”\r\n\r\n“Some people don’t care much whether things go endwise or otherwise.”\r\n\r\n“Next to a feast upon a seventeen-year-old pair of sweet lips, under\r\ngrapevines, by moon-light, is a foray upon a platter of beans, after\r\nfishing for suckers all day.”\r\n\r\n“One of the greatest bores in the world is he who will persistently\r\ngabble about _himself_ when you want to talk about _yourself_.”\r\n\r\n“Pay your debts and shame the devil for an old scoundrel.”\r\n\r\n“Bright and fair as a Miss in her teens is this beautiful March morning.\r\nAll nature laughs with gladness. Forest feels glad, the streams sing a\r\nglad song in their swim to the sea, Tionesta is glad and the big\r\ngreyhound Charley Holmes sent Major Hulings wags his sharp tail in token\r\nof the gladness and gratitude he cannot otherwise express. He is a\r\ngentlemanly, well-bred, $500 purp and got to have his meals regularly.”\r\n\r\n“Do unto other men as you would have them do unto you and you wouldn’t\r\nhave money enough in two weeks to hire a shirt washed.”\r\n\r\n“Many a preacher complains of empty pews when they are really not\r\nemptier than the pulpit.”\r\n\r\n“The man who can please everybody hasn’t got sense enough to displease\r\nanybody.”\r\n\r\n“To be good and happy kick up your heels and holler Hallelujah!”\r\n\r\n“Rev. Brown will preach everybody to hell on the Tubb’s Run Flats, Lord\r\nwilling, next Sunday, between meals.”\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth of January, 1862, Walter R. Johns, who struck the\r\nterritory four weeks previously, issued the initial number of the\r\nOil-City _Weekly Register_, the first newspaper devoted especially to\r\nthe petroleum-industry, which it upheld tenaciously for five years. The\r\nmodest outfit, purchased second-hand at Monongahela City, was shipped to\r\nPittsburg by boat, to Kittanning by rail and to its destination by\r\nwagons. The editor, publisher, proprietor and compositor—Mr. Johns\r\noutdid Pooh-Bah by combining these offices in his own person—accompanied\r\nthe expedition to aid in extricating the wagons from mud-holes in which\r\nthey stuck persistently. In 1866 he retired in favor of Henry A. Dow &\r\nCo., who fathered the _Daily Register_ and soon found the cake dough.\r\nFarther on Mr. Johns was identified, editorially or in a proprietary\r\nway, with the semi-weekly _Petrolian_ and the _Evening Register_, the\r\nParker _Transcript_, the Emlenton _Messenger_, the Lebanon _Republican_,\r\nthe Clarion _Republican-Gazette_ and the Foxburg _Gazette_. Writing with\r\ngreat readiness and heartily in touch with his profession, he took to\r\nliterary work as a duck takes to water. He and the late Andrew Cone\r\nprepared all the petroleum-statistics available in 1862, which, with the\r\ngatherings of the years intervening, were published in 1869, under the\r\nexpressive title of “Petrolia.” From Clarion, his home for some years,\r\nMr. Johns returned to Oil City, doing valuable work for the _Derrick_\r\nand the _Blizzard_. For seven years he has been employed by the\r\nNational-Transit Company to compile newspaper-clippings and\r\nmagazine-articles and arrange records of different kinds from every\r\nquarter of the oil-regions. The duty is congenial and he fits the place\r\n“like der paper mit der wall.” Mr. Johns is a son of Louisiana and a\r\nhero of two wars. During the Mexican trouble he fought under Zachary\r\nTaylor and Winfield Scott, was at the battles of Monterey and Buena\r\nVista and participated in the march from Puebla to the City of Mexico.\r\nHe served under General Grant in the “late unpleasantness.” The death of\r\nhis estimable wife several years ago was a terrible blow to the Nestor\r\nof petroleum journalism, who has gained distinction as printer, editor,\r\nauthor and soldier.\r\n\r\n           “Age sits with decent grace upon his visage\r\n           And worthily becomes his silver locks;\r\n           He bears the marks of many years well spent,\r\n           Of virtue, truth well tried and wise experience.”\r\n\r\nWith the plant of the defunct Emlenton _Echo_, which he had bought from\r\nR. F. Blair and boated to Oil City, J. W. Smullin propelled the\r\n_Monitor_ in 1863. O. H. Jackson, a sort of perambulatory\r\nprinting-office, and C. P. Ramsdell figured in the ownership at\r\ndifferent times. Jackson let go in the fall of 1864 and Jacob Weyand\r\nbossed the ranch until it was absorbed by the Venango _Republican_, the\r\nfirst out-and-out political newspaper in the settlement. Smullin farmed\r\nin Cranberry township, dispensed justice as “’Squire” and died in 1894.\r\nOf Jackson’s whereabouts nothing is known. He flaunted the _Sand-Pump_\r\nat Oil City, the _Bulletin_ at Rouseville, the _Gaslight_ at\r\nPleasantville and ephemeral sheets at other points. The outfits of the\r\nRegister, _Petrolian_, _Republican_ and _Monitor_ were consolidated in\r\nDecember, 1867, by Andrew Cone and Dr. F. F. Davis, into the weekly\r\n_Times_. The paper was well managed, well edited and well sustained. A\r\nsyndicate of politicians bought it in 1870, to boom C. W. Gilfillan, of\r\nFranklin, for Congress, and George B. Delamater, of Meadville, for\r\nState-Senator in the Crawford district. A morning daily was tacked on.\r\nL. H. Metcalfe, who lost a leg at Gettysburg, had editorial charge.\r\nThomas H. Morrison, of Pleasantville, officiated as manager, W. C.\r\nPlumer presided as foreman and A. E. Fay acted as local news-hustler.\r\nThe daily died with the close of the campaign, a fire that destroyed the\r\nestablishment hurrying the dissolution. Metcalfe went back to Meadville\r\nand was elected county-treasurer. Whole-souled, earnest and trustworthy,\r\nhe made and retained friends, wrote effectively and “served his day and\r\ngeneration” as a good man should. The grass and the flowers have bloomed\r\nabove his head for nineteen years. Morrison entered politics, put in a\r\nterm faithfully as county-treasurer, studied law, practiced at Smethport\r\nand was elected judge of the McKean-Potter district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ANDREW CONE.\r\n  MRS. CONE.\r\n  MISS THROPP.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHon. Andrew Cone, to whose bounteous purse and willing pen the Venango\r\n_Republican_ and the Oil-City _Times_ owed their continuance, was of\r\nPuritan descent, nephew of the founder of Oberlin College, born in 1822,\r\nreared on a New-York farm and married to a Maryland lady. His parents\r\ndying, he removed to Michigan, lost his first and second wives by death,\r\nand in 1862 settled at Oil City to superintend the United\r\nPetroleum-Farms Association’s sale of building-lots. He named various\r\nOil-City streets, helped build the first Baptist church and labored for\r\ntemperance and local improvements. In 1868 he married Miss Mary Eloisa\r\nThropp, of Valley Forge, a cultured linguist and writer. Her brother,\r\nJoseph E. Thropp, owns the iron-works at Everett and is married to the\r\nlate Colonel Thomas A. Scott’s eldest daughter. Her two sisters, Mrs.\r\nGeorge Porter and Miss Amelia Thropp, also reside at Oil City and are\r\ngifted writers. Mr. Cone and W. R. Johns collected the data of\r\n“Petrolia,” a perfect treasury of facts concerning oil, which the\r\nAppletons published in 1869. Governor Hartranft appointed Mr. Cone to\r\nrepresent the oil-regions at the Vienna Exposition in 1873. He served\r\nfour years with great fidelity as consul in Brazil and died in New York\r\non November seventh, 1880, as one to whom “Well done, good and faithful\r\nservant,” is spoken through all the centuries. Mrs. Cone’s “Wild Flowers\r\nof Valley Forge” will give an idea of the exquisite work of the Thropp\r\nsisters, who are esteemed for their poetic talents and unselfishness:\r\n\r\n               Blest be the flowers that freely blow\r\n                 In this neglected spot,\r\n               Anemone with leaves of snow\r\n                 And blue Forget-me-not.\r\n               God’s laurels weave their classic wreath,\r\n                 Their pale pink blossoms wave\r\n               O’er lowly mounds, where rest beneath\r\n                 Our martyrs in their grave.\r\n\r\n               In white and gold the daisies shine\r\n                 All o’er encampment hill;\r\n               There wild-rose and the Columbine\r\n                 Lift glistening banners still.\r\n               Here plumy ferns, an emerald fringe,\r\n                 Adorn our stream’s bright way;\r\n               And soft grass whence the violet springs,\r\n                 With fragrant flowers of May.\r\n\r\n               Oh, there’s a spell around these blooms\r\n                 Owned by no rarer flowers;\r\n               They blossomed on our soldiers’ tombs\r\n                 And they shall bloom on ours.\r\n               To us, as to our sires, their tone\r\n                 Breathes forth the same glad strain,\r\n               “We spring to life when winter’s gone,\r\n                 And ye shall rise again.”\r\n\r\n               Uncultured ’round our path they grow,\r\n                 Smile up before our tread\r\n               To cheer, as they did long ago\r\n                 Our noble-hearted dead.\r\n               Arbutus in the sheltering wood\r\n                 Sighs, “Here he came to pray,”\r\n               And Pansies whisper, “Thus we stood\r\n                 When heroes passed away.”\r\n\r\n               Thus every wild-flower’s simple leaf\r\n                 Breathes in my native vale,\r\n               To conscious hearts, some record brief,\r\n                 Some true and touching tale.\r\n               Wealth’s gay parterre in glory stands:—\r\n                 I own their foreign claims,\r\n               Those gorgeous flowers from other lands,\r\n                 Rare plants with wondrous names.\r\n\r\n               Ye blossomed in our martyr’s field\r\n                 Beneath the warm spring’s sun,\r\n               Sprung from the turf where lowly kneeled\r\n                 Our matchless Washington.\r\n               Ye in our childhood’s garden grew,\r\n                 Our sainted mother’s bowers;\r\n               My grateful heart beats high to you,\r\n                 My own wild valley-flowers!\r\n\r\nThe collapse of the syndicate _Times_ terminated experimental dailies in\r\nOil City. Mr. Gilfillan, F. W. Mitchell, P. R. Gray and other\r\nstockholders sold the good-will and smoking ruins to Sheriff H. H.\r\nHerpst, who revived the weekly with Dr. Davis at the bellows. It was\r\nrather weakly, notwithstanding the doctor’s excellent doses of leaded\r\npellets. Advertisers seemed a trifle shy and columns of blank space, by\r\nno means nutritious pabulum, were not infrequent. Everybody favored a\r\nnewer, grander, bolder stride forward. The borough and suburbs had\r\nattained the dignity of a city, an oil-exchange had been organized,\r\nrailroads were coming in and a paper of metropolitan scope was urgently\r\ndemanded. Usually men adapted to a particular niche turn up and the\r\ntraditional “long-felt want” is not likely to remain unfilled.\r\n\r\nColeman E. Bishop and W. H. Longwell landed in Oil City one summer\r\nafternoon to “view the landscape o’er,” as good Dr. Watts phrased it.\r\nThey had heard the Macedonian cry and decided to size up the situation.\r\nBishop achieved greatness at Jamestown, N. Y., where he edited the\r\n_Journal_, by attacking Commander Cushing, the naval officer who sank\r\nthe Confederate ram Merrimac, and kicking him down stairs when the\r\nindignant marine invaded the sanctum to “horsewhip the editor and pitch\r\nhim out of the window.” Longwell, a brave soldier and sharp man of\r\naffairs, had learned the ropes at Pithole and Petroleum Centre. A deal\r\nwas soon closed, material ordered and a building on Seneca street\r\nrented, Herpst keeping an interest as silent partner.\r\n\r\nThe Oil-City _Derrick_, ordained to become “the organ of oil,” was born\r\non the thirteenth of September, 1871. The name was an inspiration,\r\nsprung by Bishop as a surprise, instead of the hackneyed _Times_, which\r\nhad been agreed upon by the three proprietors. To embody its most\r\nconspicuous emblem in the head of a newspaper designed to represent the\r\noil-trade suggested itself to the alert editor. He consulted only his\r\nforeman, Charles E. White, long the brilliant editor of the Tidioute\r\n_News_, who had come with him from Jamestown and approved of the drawing\r\nfrom which the famous design of a derrick spouting newspapers was\r\nengraved. It was a go from the start. People were roused from their\r\nslumber by strong-lunged newsboys shouting, “Derrick, ere’s yer Derrick,\r\nDerrick!” Their first impulse was to wonder if they had left any\r\nderricks out all night, exposed to thieves and marauders, and somebody\r\nwas bringing them home. The new sheet was scanned eagerly. It had\r\ndepartments of “Spray,” “Lying Around Loose” and “Pick-ups,” teeming\r\nwith catchy, piquant, invigorating items. Its advocacy of the producers’\r\ncause boomed the paper tremendously. A bitter fight with the Allegheny\r\nValley Railroad increased its circulation and prestige. Bishop’s\r\nindividuality permeated every page and column. He had the sand to\r\ncontinue the railroad war, but a threat to remove the shops from Oil\r\nCity weakened his partners and they bought him out in 1873. From the\r\n“Hub of Oildom” he went to Buffalo to edit the _Express_. Thence he went\r\nto Bradford, embarked in oil-operations on Kendall Creek and enlivened\r\nthe Chautauqua _Herald_, Rev. Theodore Flood’s bonanza, one summer.\r\nInvited to New York in 1880, he managed the _Merchants’ Review_ and\r\nedited _Judge_ until it changed owners in 1885. Leaving the metropolis,\r\nhe wandered to Dakota and freshened the Rapid-City _Republican_.\r\nReturning east, he furnished Washington correspondence to various\r\npapers. Locomotor-ataxia disabled him and he died in 1896. Mrs. Bishop\r\nis a popular teacher of the Delsarte system and has published a book on\r\nthe subject. Miss Bishop is a talented lecturer. It is not disparaging\r\nthe galaxy of oil-region journalists to say that C. E. Bishop, the\r\ngamest, keenest, raciest member of the fraternity, might be termed a\r\nbishop in the congregation of men who have shaped public opinion in the\r\ndomain of grease. No matter how difficult or delicate the theme, from\r\npre-natal influence to monopoly, from heredity to fishing, from biology\r\nto pumpkins, he treated it tersely and charmingly. A thoroughbred from\r\ntop to toe, his was a Damascus blade and “none but himself can be his\r\nparallel.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Longwell—the title was awarded for gallantry in many a hard\r\nbattle—attended to the business-end with decided success. Buying\r\nHerpst’s claim, he conducted the whole concern four years and sold out\r\nat a steep figure in 1877. He raked in wealth producing and speculating,\r\nquitting well-heeled financially. A native of Adams county, he was\r\neducated at Gettysburg and learned printing in the office of the\r\nChambersburg _Repository and Whig_, then published by Col. Alexander K.\r\nMcClure, now the world-famed editor of the Philadelphia _Times_. His\r\nmother was a descendant of James Wilson, a signer of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Herpst opened a wall-paper store, removed later to\r\nJamestown and died there in 1884. Square, honest and “straight as a\r\nstring,” he merited the regard of his fellows. Charles H. Morse, the\r\nfirst city-editor, had the snap to corral news at sight and present it\r\ntoothsomely. Who that knew him in his beardless youth imagined Charley\r\nwould “get religion” and adorn the pulpit? He entered the ministry and\r\nfor over twenty years has been pastor of a Baptist church at Mercer.\r\nWere he to serve up to his hearers some of the funny experiences he\r\nencountered as a reporter, he would discount Talmage’s recitals of the\r\nslums and Dr. Parkhurst’s leap-frog exploits in the Tenderloin! Archie\r\nFrazer wrote the market-report, ten or twelve lines at first and a plump\r\ncolumn or more ultimately. In November of 1872 it was my luck to engage\r\nwith the _Derrick_ and inaugurate the role of traveling correspondent.\r\nVenango and Warren, with Clarion, Armstrong and Butler budding into\r\nprominence, covered the oil-fields. Bradford loomed up in the autumn of\r\n1875, extending my mission from the northern line of McKean county to\r\nthe southern boundary of Butler before the close of the term of five\r\nyears. These breezy days were crowded with bustle and excitement,\r\nadventure and incident. Over the signature of “J. J. M.”—possibly\r\nremembered by old-timers—fate appointed me to chronicle a multitude of\r\nevents that played an important part in petroleum-annals. The system of\r\n“monthly reports” was arranged methodically, the producing sections were\r\nvisited regularly and my acquaintance embraced every oil-farm and nearly\r\nevery oil-operator in the rushing, hustling, get-up-and-get world of\r\npetroleum.\r\n\r\nOrion Clemens, a brother of “Mark Twain,” worked on the _Derrick_ a few\r\nweeks in 1873. The exact opposite of “Mark,” his forte was the pathetic.\r\nHe could write up the death of an insect or a reptile so feelingly that\r\nsensitive folks would shed gallons of tears in the wood-shed over the\r\nharrowing details. He fairly reveled in the gloomy, somber, tragic\r\nelement of life. Daily contributions taxed him too severely, as he\r\ncomposed slowly, and his resignation caused no surprise. Frank H.\r\nTaylor, a young graduate from the Tidioute _Journal_, succeeded Bishop,\r\nvacating the chair to undertake the field-work. Frank can afford to\r\n“point with pride” to his career as editor and compiler of statistics.\r\nHis “Handbook” is an unquestioned authority on petroleum. Once he\r\nresigned to float the _Call_, a sprightly Sunday folio, which glistened\r\nfrom the spring of 1877 to October of 1878. “Puts and Calls,” the\r\nhumorous column, had to answer for bursting off tons of vest-buttons.\r\nTaylor acquired money and fame as a journalist, was president of\r\nselect-council, called the turn as a producer and saved a snug\r\ncompetence. During a term of Congress he was Hon. J. C. Sibley’s\r\nsecretary, a position demanding remarkable tact and industry. Now he is\r\nleasing lands, drilling wells and looking after the oil-properties of\r\nSibley & Co. in Indiana. Oil City is his home and he is as busy as a boy\r\nclubbing chestnuts or a Brooklynite dodging the trolley-cars at thirty\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHAS. E. WHITE.\r\n  HOMER McCLINTOCK.          FRANK H. TAYLOR.\r\n  P. C. BOYLE.\r\n  EDWARD STUCK.          WM. H. SIVITER.\r\n  W. J. McCULLAGH.\r\n]\r\n\r\nRobert W. Criswell, who has forged to the front by his mirth-provoking\r\nsketches, followed Taylor as editor in 1877. He fertilized the\r\n“Stray-sand,” parodied Shakespeare and developed “Grandfather\r\nLickshingle,” giving the _Derrick_ national celebrity. He stepped down\r\nwhen the shuffle occurred in 1877 and went to the Cincinnati _Enquirer_.\r\nW. J. McCullagh and Frank W. Bowen were on deck at about the same time.\r\nMcCullagh held the field department up to its elevated standard and\r\nBowen ground out first-class local and editorial. Col. Edward Stuck, who\r\ncame from York in 1879 to supervise the Bradford _Era_, ran the machine\r\nin 1880-2, displaying much ability in the face of manifold hindrances.\r\nWilliam Brough and J. M. Bonham of Franklin, gentlemen of high literary\r\nattainments, wishing to have a paper of their own, induced Mr. Stuck to\r\nleave Bradford, with a view to resurrect the _Sunday Call_. The project\r\nwas not carried out and he assumed charge of the _Derrick_, with\r\ngratifying results. His training was acquired on the York _Democratic\r\nPress_, his father’s weekly, which Col. Stuck now conducts in connection\r\nwith the _Daily Age_, established by him after his sojourn in Oil City.\r\nHe was appointed State Librarian during Governor Pattison’s first term\r\nand elected Register of Wills of York county in 1889, in recognition of\r\nhis excellent journalistic services. William H. Siviter, straight from\r\ncollege, was next in order. His polished, scholarly writings were\r\nrelished by educated people. He paragraphed for the Pittsburg\r\n_Chronicle-Telegraph_ and for some years has contributed to the comic\r\nweeklies. He is responsible for the “High-School Girl,” with her\r\nBostonese flavor and highfalutin speech. McCullagh became an operator in\r\nthe Bradford region, drilled extensively in Ohio, laid by considerable\r\nboodle and chose Toledo as his residence. Robert Simpson, who began as\r\n“printer’s devil” in 1872, remained with the _Derrick_ as a writer until\r\nthe _Blizzard_ blew into town, excepting brief respites at Emlenton and\r\nBradford.\r\n\r\nP. C. Boyle, whose dash and skill and tireless energy had advanced him\r\nsteadily, leased the establishment in 1885. He had the vigor and\r\nbackbone needed to bring the paper back to its pristine strength. By\r\nturns a roustabout at Pithole in 1866, a driller, a scout, a reporter, a\r\npublisher and an editor, his experience in the oil-country was extensive\r\nand invaluable. He published the _Laborer’s Voice_ at Martinsburg in\r\n1877-8, reported for the _Derrick_ and Titusville _Herald_ in 1879, for\r\nthe _Petroleum World_ in 1880 and the Olean _Herald_ in 1881, conducted\r\nthe Richburg _Echo_ in 1881-2 and scouted all through the developments\r\nat Cherry Grove, Macksburg and Thorn Creek in 1882-5. George Dillingham,\r\nwho had “a nose for news,” and J. N. Perrine, gilt-edged and yard-wide\r\nin the counting-room, assisted Mr. Boyle in tuning the paper up to high\r\nG. The outside fields, daily growing in number and importance, were put\r\nin charge of Homer McClintock, the real Homer of oil-reporters. He\r\nfattens on timely paragraphs, scents live items in the air and lets no\r\njuicy happening escape. The force was augmented as occasion arose,\r\ntype-setting machines and fast presses were added, the job-office was\r\nsupplied with the latest and best materials and the _Derrick_ is to-day\r\none of the finest, brightest, smartest newspapers that ever edified a\r\ncommunity. It is owned by the Derrick Publishing Company, of which Mr.\r\nBoyle is president and H. McClintock, J. N. Perrine and Alfred L. Snell\r\nare the active members. Mr. Boyle also managed the Toledo _Commercial_\r\nand the Bradford _Era_. He is “the Dean of the Fourth Estate” by virtue\r\nof eminent services and seniority. Like the lightning, he never needs\r\nstrike twice in the same spot, because the job is finished at a single\r\nlick when he goes “loaded for b’ar.”\r\n\r\nJohn B. Smithman, a wealthy operator, to whom Oil City owes its\r\nstreet-railways and a bridge spanning the Allegheny, in 1880 equipped\r\nthe _Telegraph_, an evening sunflower, with Philip C. Welch at its head.\r\nIsaac N. Pratt, later an advance-agent for Ezra Kendall, had a finger in\r\nthe pie. The paper was as fetching as a rural maiden in a brand-new\r\ncalico gown, but two dailies were too rich for the blood of the\r\npopulation and the _Telegraph_ wilted at a tender age. Welch tapped a\r\nvein of rich humor in the Philadelphia _Call_ by originating\r\n“Accidentally Overheard,” a feature that captured the bakery. It bubbled\r\nwith actual wit, fragrant as sweet clover and wholesome as morning dew,\r\nnot revamped and twisted and warmed over. Charles A. Dana, no mean judge\r\nof literary merit, recognized the value of the Welch rarebits and\r\nsecured them for the New York _Sun_ at a fixed rate for each, big or\r\nlittle, long or short, large or small. Anon Dana offered him a salary\r\nfew bank-presidents would refuse and Welch moved to Gotham. The _Sun_\r\nthat “shines for all” fairly glittered and dazzled. Welch’s “Tailor-Made\r\nGirl” hit the popular taste and was published in elegant form by the\r\nScribners. Disease preyed upon him, compelling an operation similar to\r\nGeneral Grant’s. Half the tongue was cut off, affecting his utterance\r\nseriously. Weeks and months of patient suffering ended at last in\r\nrelease from earthly pain and sorrow. Mrs. Welch, a noble helpmeet,\r\nlives in Brooklyn and is to be credited with the clever, dainty “From\r\nHer Point of View,” which irradiates the Sunday issues of the New York\r\n_Times_. Upon the grave of Philip C. Welch old friends would lay a\r\nwreath and drop a sympathetic tear.\r\n\r\n                       “Alas, Poor Yorick!\r\n                       I knew him, Horatio;\r\n                       A fellow of infinite jest,\r\n                       Of most excellent fancy.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRANK. W. BOWEN.\r\n  PHILIP C. WELCH.         ROBERT SIMPSON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrank W. Bowen, a diamond of the first water, H. G. McKnight, the\r\nlightning type-slinger, and B. F. Gates, a dandy printer, swarmed from\r\nthe _Derrick_ hive and raised the wind to blow an evening _Blizzard_ in\r\n1882. They bought the _Telegraph_ stuff and the Richburg _Echo_ press,\r\nhad brains and pluck in abundance and went in to win. The significant\r\nmotto—“It blows on whom it pleases and for others’ snuff ne’er\r\nsneezes”—attested the independence of the free-playing zephyr. Gentle as\r\nthe summer breezes when dealing with the good, the true and the\r\nbeautiful, it swept everything before it when a wrong was to be righted,\r\na sleek rascal unmasked or a monopoly toppled over. Bowen’s “Little\r\nBlizzards” had a laugh in every line. If they stung transgressors by\r\ntheir sharp thrusts, the author didn’t lie awake nights trying to load\r\nup with mean things. His humor was spontaneous and easy as rolling off a\r\nlog. Now his friends and admirers—their name is Legion—propose to waft\r\nhim into the Legislature, a clear case of the office seeking the man. It\r\ngoes without saying that the _Blizzard_ was an instant success. It was\r\nno fault of the fond parents that they were built that way and couldn’t\r\ncompel people not to want their exhilarating paper. Place its neat\r\nmake-up to McKnight’s account. Gates flocked by himself to usher in the\r\n_Venango Democrat_, which the gods loved so well that it passed through\r\nthe golden gates in four weeks. Robert Simpson, jocularly styled its\r\n“horse editor,” was a _Blizzard_ trump-card until 1886. He then filled\r\nconsecutive engagements as exchange-editor, news-editor, night-editor,\r\nassistant managing-editor and legislative correspondent of the Pittsburg\r\n_Dispatch_. Again he edited the _Derrick_ nine months in 1889. Returning\r\nto Pittsburg as political-reporter of the _Commercial-Gazette_, he was\r\npromoted to legislative-correspondent and lastly to managing-editor, a\r\nposition of much responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe Reno _Times_, an eight-column folio that ranked with the foremost\r\nweeklies in the State, was started in 1865 and expired in May of 1866. A\r\ndepartment was assigned each kind of news, the matter was classified and\r\nset in minion and nonpareil, oil-operations were noted fully and local\r\naffairs received due attention. Samuel B. Page, the editor, understood\r\nhow to glean from exchanges and correspondence. George E. Beardsley,\r\nwhose parish lay along Oil Creek, about Pithole and the Allegheny River\r\nfrom Franklin to Tidioute, a section thirty miles by seventy, managed\r\nthe oil-columns admirably. E. W. Mercer kept the books, collected the\r\nbills and had general supervision. W. C. Plumer, J. Diffenbach and\r\nEdward Fairchilds stuck type and the average edition exceeded\r\nten-thousand copies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES C. WICKER.]\r\n\r\nPithole, the most kaleidoscopic oil-town that ever stranded human lives\r\nand bank-accounts, gave birth to the _Daily Record_ on the twenty-fifth\r\nof September, 1865. It was a five-column folio, crammed with news\r\npiping-hot and sold at five cents a copy, or thirty cents a week.\r\nMorton, Spare & Co. were the publishers. Col. L. M. Morton—he earned his\r\nshoulder-straps in the civil war—edited the _Record_, winning laurels by\r\nhis wise discernment. He was a manly character, incapable of deceit, a\r\nbrilliant writer and conversationalist, the soul of honor and courtesy,\r\n“a knight without fear and without reproach.” He served as postmaster at\r\nMilton and spent his closing years as night-editor of the Bradford\r\n_Era_, dying at his post, loved and esteemed by thousands of friends. W.\r\nH. Longwell, another brave defender of the Union, bought out Spare in\r\nMay, 1886. Charles C. Wicker and W. C. Plumer were taken into the firm\r\nshortly after. In May of 1868, Pithole having crawled into a hole,\r\nLongwell changed the base of operations to Petroleum Centre, then at the\r\nzenith of its meteoric flight. He sold the paper in 1871 to Wicker, who\r\nheld on until formidable rivals in Oil City and Titusville forced the\r\n_Record_ to quit. Generous to a fault and faithful to those who shared\r\nhis confidence, Wicker left the decaying town in 1873, was foreman of\r\nthe Titusville _Courier_, worked as a compositor at Bradford and died\r\nthere years ago. He was never satisfied to accept ill-luck without\r\nemphatic dissent. He always wore a blue-flannel shirt, a fashion he\r\nadopted in the army, and was eccentric in attire.\r\n\r\nCharles C. Leonard was “a bright, particular star” in the days of\r\nthe Pithole _Record_, to which, over the signature of “Crocus,” he\r\ncontributed side-splitting sketches of ludicrous phases of\r\noil-region life. These felicitous word-paintings, with additions and\r\nrevisions, he published in a volume that had a prodigious sale. He\r\nwas an Ohioan, born in 1845, and a soldier at sixteen. Arriving at\r\nPithole in 1865, he saw that wonderful place grow from a dozen\r\nshanties to a city of fifteen-thousand at a pace distancing Jonah’s\r\ngourd or Jack-the-Giant-Killer’s bean-stalk. In the fall of 1867 he\r\ncame to the Titusville _Herald_, remaining five years. After short\r\nterms with the Cleveland _Leader_ and St. Louis _Globe_, he returned\r\nto Titusville to write for the _Evening Press_. He went back to St.\r\nLouis and died at Cleveland on the twelfth of March 1874, wounds\r\nreceived in battle hastening his demise. He was a natural wit, whose\r\nkeen jokes had the aroma of Attic salt. Mrs. Leonard removed to\r\nDetroit, her home at present. One of Charlie’s favorite creations\r\nwas “The Sheet-Iron Cat,” written for the Cleveland _Leader_. It\r\npassed the rounds of the newspapers and was printed in the\r\n_Scientific American_. The sell took immensely, lots of persons\r\nsending letters asking the cost of the “cats” and where they could\r\nbe procured! The article, which revives many a pleasant memory of\r\n“auld lang-syne,” follows:\r\n\r\n“A young mechanic in this city, whose friends and acquaintances have\r\nheretofore supposed there was “nothing to him,” has at last achieved a\r\ntriumph that will place him at once among the noblest benefactors of\r\nmankind. His name will be handed down to posterity with those of the\r\ninventors of the “steam-man,” the patent churn and other contrivances of\r\na labor-saving or comfort-inducing character. His invention, which\r\noccurred to him when trying to sleep at night in the sky-parlor of his\r\ncheap boarding-house, with the feline demons of mid-night clattering\r\nover the roof outside, is nothing more than a patent sheet-iron cat with\r\ncylindrical attachment, steel-claws and teeth, the whole arrangement\r\nbeing covered with cat-skins, which give it a natural appearance and\r\npreserve the clock-work and intricate machinery with which the old thing\r\nis made to work. Among the other peculiarities of this ingenious\r\ninvention are the tail and voice. The former is hollow and supplied by a\r\nbellows (concealed within the body) with compressed air at momentary\r\nintervals, which causes the appendage to be elevated and distended to\r\nthree times its natural size, giving to the metallic cat a most warlike\r\nand belligerent appearance. By the aid of the same bellows and a\r\ntremolo-stop arrangement, the cat is made to emit the most fearful\r\ncaterwauls and “spitting” that ever awakened a baby, made the head of\r\nthe family swear in his dreams, or caused a shower of boots, washbowls\r\nand other missiles of midnight wrath to cleave the sky.\r\n\r\n“Such is the invention. The method of using and the result is as\r\nfollows: Winding up the patent Thomas-cat, the owner adjusts him upon\r\nthe house-top or in the back-yard and awaits events. Soon is heard the\r\ntocsin of cat-like war in the shape of every known sound that the tribe\r\nare capable of producing, only in a key much louder than any live cat\r\ncould perform in. Every cat within a circle of a half-mile hears the\r\nfamiliar sounds and accepts the challenge, frequently fifty or one\r\nhundred appearing simultaneously upon the battle-ground, ready to buckle\r\nin. The swelling tail invites combat and they attack old “Ironsides,”\r\nwho no sooner feels the weight of a paw upon his hide than a spring is\r\ntouched off, his paws revolve in all directions with lightning rapidity\r\nand the adversaries within six feet of him are torn to shreds! Fresh\r\nbattalions come to the scratch only to meet a like fate, and in the\r\nmorning several bushels of hair, fiddle-strings and toe-nails is all\r\nthat are seen, while the owner proceeds to wind the iron cat up and set\r\nhim again.\r\n\r\n“But a few pleasant evenings are needed to clean out a common-sized\r\ncountry town of its sleep-disturbers. We understand the inventor will\r\nmake a proposition next week to the common council to depopulate the\r\ncity of cats for a moderate sum. We do not intend to endorse any\r\ninvention or article unless we know that it will perform all that it is\r\nclaimed to do, and therefore we have not been so explicit in our\r\ndescription as we might have been; but the principle is a good one, and\r\nwe hope to see every house in the city surmounted with a sheet-iron cat\r\nas soon as they are offered for sale, which will be about April the\r\nfirst, the inventor and patentee informs us.”\r\n\r\nJ. H. Bowman and Richard Linn sent forth the _Petroleum Monthly_ at Oil\r\nCity in October, 1870. Their purpose was to treat the oil-industry from\r\na scientific stand and present statistics and biographies in\r\nmagazine-style. The _Monthly_, which lasted a year, was ably edited and\r\nsupplied matter of permanent value. Bowman, a fascinating writer and\r\nagreeable companion, went westward and the snows of twenty winters have\r\ndrifted over his grave. Linn aided in compiling a history of petroleum,\r\nspent some years in the east and meandered to Australia. Pleasantville\r\nevolved the _Evening News_ in 1888 and the semi-monthly\r\n_Commercial-Record_. The former has sought “the dark realms of\r\neverlasting shade,” to keep company with J. L. Rohr’s Cooperstown\r\n_News_, Tom Whitaker’s _Gatling Gun_, the Oil-City _Critic_, the\r\nFranklin _Oil-Region_, the Petroleum-Centre _Era_ and a score of unwept\r\nsacrifices on the altar of Venango journalism. James Tyson, a hardware\r\nmerchant at Rouseville, in 1872 issued the _Pennsylvanian_, a superior\r\nweekly, which subsided with the waning town. He migrated to California,\r\nliving in San Francisco until last year, when he located in\r\nPhiladelphia. At the age of seventy-nine his faculties are unimpaired\r\nand he stands erect. He is an earnest member of the Pennsylvania\r\nHistorical Society and compiler of a “Life of Washington and the Signers\r\nof the Declaration of Independence.” This timely and interesting work,\r\npublished in two handsome volumes in 1895, is dedicated to the public\r\nschools of the nation. It fitly crowns the literary labors of the\r\nrevered author, who is “only waiting till the shadows are a little\r\nlonger drawn.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN PONTON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES TYSON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES C. LEONARD.]\r\n\r\nTitusville enjoys the honor of harboring the first petroleum-daily that\r\nweathered the storm and stayed in the ring. June, 1865, heralded the\r\n_Morning Herald_ of W. W. and Henry C. Bloss, which possessed the entire\r\nfield and prospered accordingly. Col. J. H. Cogswell joined the\r\npartnership in 1866. Major W. W. Bloss, the elder of the two brothers,\r\nwas a fluent writer, and made his mark in journalism. Mastering the\r\ndetails of “the art preservative” at Rochester, N. Y., in 1857 he\r\nstarted a short-lived journal in Kansas, retraced his footsteps to his\r\nnative heath in 1859, was badly wounded at Antietam, beamed upon\r\nTitusville in the spring of 1865 and bought the _Petroleum Reporter_, a\r\nmoribund weekly. Quitting the _Herald_, in 1873, he unfurled the banner\r\nof the _Evening Press_, which did not live to cut its eye-teeth. His\r\nnext attempt, a tasteful weekly, traveled the road to oblivion. The\r\nMajor once more headed for Kansas, served in the Legislature and wended\r\nhis way to Chicago, whence he crossed “to the other side” in the prime\r\nof matured manhood. Harry C. Bloss stuck to the _Herald_ “through evil\r\nand through good report,” steadfastly upholding Titusville and dipping\r\nhis eagle feather in vitriol when necessary to squelch “a foeman worthy\r\nof his steel.” He died—the ranks are thinning out sadly—four years ago\r\nand his son, upon whom the mantle of his father has descended, is\r\nkeeping the paper in the van. Col. Cogswell, who dropped out to accept\r\nthe postmastership, enacting the role of “Nasby” a couple of terms, for\r\nyears has been in the office of the Tidewater Pipe-Line. Among the\r\n_Herald_ force were C. C. Leonard, John Ponton and A. E. Fay. Ponton\r\nturned his peculiar talent for invention to electrical pursuits and the\r\ngiddy telephone. He narrowly missed heading off Prof. Bell in stumbling\r\nupon the “hello” machine. Fay forsook the _Herald_ for the Oil-City\r\n_Times_, did a turn on the Titusville _Courier_ and hied him to Arizona.\r\nHe ran a mining-paper, sat in the Legislature, incubated a\r\nchicken-nursery that would have dumbfounded Rutherford B. Hayes, farmed\r\na bit and harvested a crop of shekels.\r\n\r\nThe Titusville _Courier_, sprung in 1870 to oppose the _Herald_, was\r\nedited by Col. J. T. Henry, an accomplished journalist from Olean, N. Y.\r\nIn 1871 he bought the _Sunday News_, formerly A. L. Chapman’s\r\n_Long-Roll_, transferring it in 1872 to W. W. Bloss, who changed it to\r\nthe _Evening Press_. Col. Henry in 1873 published “Early and Later\r\nHistory of Petroleum,” a large volume, replete with information,\r\nbiographies and portraits. The author speculated profitably in oil,\r\nlived at Olean, wrote as the impulse prompted and died at Jamestown in\r\nMay, 1878. A tear is due the memory of a kingly, chivalrous man, who\r\nreflected luster upon his profession and was not fully appreciated until\r\nhe had reached the haven of eternal rest. To him Littleton’s tribute\r\napplies:\r\n\r\n            “He wrote not a line which dying he would blot.”\r\n\r\nWarren C. Plumer guided the _Courier_ after Col. Henry’s retirement. He\r\nwas no tyro in slinging his quill. Born in Maine in 1835, at fourteen he\r\nentered a printing-office, ten years later edited a paper, served three\r\nyears in the war, set type on the Reno _Times_ in 1865 and was\r\neditor-journeyman of the Pithole _Record_ in the fall of 1866. His\r\n“Dedbete” contributions were a striking feature of the _Record_, of\r\nwhich he became joint-owner with Longwell and Wicker in 1867, when\r\nBurgess of Pithole, and editor-in-chief upon its removal to Petroleum\r\nCentre in 1868. Selling out in 1869, Wicker and Plumer lighted a _Weekly\r\nStar_ at Titusville that quickly set to rise no more. Plumer was foreman\r\nof the Oil City _Times_ in 1870-1 and connected with the Tidioute\r\n_Journal_ in 1872, when offered the editorship of the _Courier_. Elected\r\nto the Legislature on the Democratic ticket in 1874, he was defeated for\r\na second term and for Congress as the Greenbackers’ candidate in 1878.\r\nFor a time his political notions were as facile as his Faber and he\r\ntrained with whatever party chanced to have a vacancy. From 1879 to 1881\r\nhe controlled the Meadville _Vindicator_, a soft-money weekly, winding\r\nup the latter year on the Richburg _Echo_. In Dakota, his next\r\nstamping-ground, he edited Republican papers at Fargo, Bismarck,\r\nAberdeen and Casselton. He stumped several states for Blaine with an eye\r\nto an appointment that would have swelled his bank-account to the\r\ndimensions of a plumber’s. “The Plumed Knight” failed to connect and the\r\nplum did not fall into the lap of his eloquent supporter. President\r\nHarrison in 1891 appointed him Receiver of the Minot District\r\nLand-office, North Dakota, which he resigned last year. As an orator\r\nCol. W. C. Plumer—they call him “Colonel” in the Dakotas—trots in the\r\nclass with Robert G. Ingersoll, Thomas B. Reed and William McKinley and\r\nis denominated the “Silver Tongue of the North-west.” At the Republican\r\nNational Conventions in 1884-8 he was unanimously pronounced the finest\r\noff-hand speaker in the crowd. He is a finished lecturer and unrivaled\r\nstory-teller, loves the choicest books, reads the Bible diligently,\r\nsticks to his friends and delights to recount his experiences in the\r\nPennsylvania oil-regions.\r\n\r\nM. N. Allen, an original stockholder and its last guardian, purchased\r\nthe _Courier_ in 1874. Even his acknowledged skill could not put it on a\r\npaying basis and the paper, unsurpassed in quality and appearance,\r\nsuccumbed to the inevitable. Mr. Allen followed Col. Cogswell as\r\npostmaster, a proper tribute to his rugged Democracy. Hale and hearty,\r\nalthough “over the summit of life,” time has dealt kindly with him and\r\nhis deft pen has lost none of its vigor. He is editing the _Advance\r\nGuard_, the outgrowth of Roger Sherman’s departed _American Citizen_, as\r\nan intellectual pastime. F. A. Tozer, the champion “fat take,”\r\nfive-feet-four-inches high and four-feet-five-inches around, graduated\r\nfrom the _Courier_, wafted the St. Petersburg _Crude-Local_ up the flume\r\nand was chief-cook of the East-Brady _Times_. His reports were newsy and\r\npalatable. He travels for a Pittsburg house and would pay extra fare if\r\npassengers were carried by weight. The East-Brady _Review_ “sees” the\r\n_Times_ and “goes it one better.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL L. WILLIAMS.]\r\n\r\nGraham & Hoag’s _Sunday News-Letter_ arose from the tomb of the\r\nEvening Press and the _Sunday-News_. J. W. Graham, now of the\r\n_Herald_, piloted the trim vessel skillfully. A stock-company of\r\nproducers, thinking a daily in the family would be “a thing of beauty”\r\nand “a joy forever,” bought the _News-Letter_ and the _Courier_\r\nequipment in 1879, to start the _Petroleum World_. James M. Place, a\r\npusher from Pusherville, had solicited the bulk of the subscriptions\r\nto the stock and was entrusted with the management. R. W. Criswell\r\nedited the paper splendidly. Captain M. H. Butler, who put heaps of\r\nginger into his spicy effusions, and John P. Zane, whose hobby was\r\nfinance—both have gone the journey that has no return trip—embellished\r\nits columns with thoughtful, digestible brain-food. Oil-news, readable\r\nlocals, dispatches, jaunty selections and bang-up neatness were never\r\nlacking. But competition was fierce and the _World_ had a hard row to\r\nhoe. A committee of stockholders soon took charge. Place, sleepless,\r\nindomitable and with the energy of a steam-hammer, opened a big store\r\nat Richburg and drove a rattling trade. Setting out to paddle his own\r\ncanoe as a Corry newsboy at ten, he had run a newsroom at Fagundas, a\r\nbookstore and the post-office at St. Petersburg, a branch store at\r\nEdenburg, large stores at Bradford and Bolivar and won laurels as the\r\ngreatest newspaper circulator in the petroleum-diggings. At Harrisburg\r\nand Reading he swung papers and the _Globe_ in New York. He is now in\r\nWashington. S. L. Williams, unexcelled as a sprightly writer, and Hon.\r\nGeorge E. Mapes, equally competent in the Legislature and the\r\neditorial chair, kept the _World_ booming until “patience ceased to be\r\na virtue” and the daily ceased to be a sheet. About half the material\r\nwent to the Oil City _Blizzard_ and the rest went to print the _Sunday\r\nWorld_ Frank W. Truesdell had determined to originate. The late Hon.\r\nA. N. Perrin, ex-Mayor of Titusville, possessing “ample means and\r\nample generosity,” backed the project. Truesdell finished his trade as\r\nprinter in Cleveland and worked at Youngstown and Franklin, settling\r\nat Titusville in 1880 to manage the _World_ jobbing-room. He was a\r\nyoung man of fine ability and scrupulous integrity. His partnership\r\nwith Perrin ended in 1887 by his purchase of the entire business. He\r\nsold a half-interest in the paper in 1893 and death claimed him in\r\nOctober of 1894. Measured by his thirty-seven years, Frank Willard\r\nTruesdell’s life was short; measured by his good deeds, his worthy\r\nenterprises, his lofty sentiments and kindly acts, it was longer than\r\nthat of many who pass the Psalmist’s three-score-and-ten. Mrs.\r\nTruesdell and her little daughter live in Titusville. F. F. Murray,\r\nassociated with Walter Izant and W. R. Herbert in the general details,\r\nedits the _Sunday World_, which is as frisky as a spring-colt. Born at\r\nBuffalo in 1860, Murray was reared in Venango county, whither his\r\nfather was drawn by the oil-excitement. Correspondence for local\r\npapers naturally bore him into the journalistic swim. He whooped it up\r\nsix years for the _Blizzard_. A regular hummer, he is at home whether\r\nflaying monopolists, taking a ruffian’s scalp, praising a pretty girl,\r\nwriting a tearful obituary, dissecting a suspicious job or reeling off\r\na natty poem. “The Old Tramp-Printer,” a recent effort, is a fair\r\nsample of his quality:\r\n\r\n “Here’s a rhyme to the old tramp-printer, who as long as he lives will\r\n    roam,\r\n Whose ‘card’ is his principal treasure and where night overtakes him\r\n    home;\r\n Whose shoes are run over and twisty, whose garments are shiny and thin,\r\n And who takes a bunk in the basement when the pressman lets him in.\r\n\r\n “It is true there are some of the trampers that only the Angel of Death,\r\n When he touches them with his sickle, can cure of the ‘spirituous\r\n    breath’;\r\n That some by their fellow-trampers are shunned as unwholesome scamps,\r\n And that some are just aimless, homeless, restless, typographical\r\n    tramps.\r\n\r\n “But the most of them surely are worthy of something akin to praise,\r\n And have drifted down to the present out of wholesomer, happier days;\r\n And when, though his looks be as seedy as ever a mortal wore,\r\n Will you find the old tramper minus his marvelous fund of lore?\r\n\r\n “What paper hasn’t he worked on? Whose manuscript hasn’t he set?\r\n What story worthy remembrance was he ever known to forget?\r\n What topics rise for discussion, in science, letters or art,\r\n That the genuine old tramp-printer cannot grapple and play his part?\r\n\r\n “It is true you will sometimes see him when the hue that adorns his nose\r\n Outrivals the crimson flushes which the peony flaunts at the rose;\r\n It is true that much grime he gathers in the course of each trip he\r\n    takes,\r\n Inasmuch as he boards all freight-trains between the Gulf and the Lakes.\r\n\r\n “Yet his knowledge grows more abundant than many much-titled men’s,\r\n Who travel as scholarly tourists and are classed with the upper-tens;\r\n And few are the contributions these scholarly ones have penned\r\n That the seediest, shabbiest tramper couldn’t readily cut and mend.\r\n\r\n “He has little in life to bind him to one place more than the rest,\r\n For his hopes in the past lie buried with the ones that he loved the\r\n    best;\r\n He has little to hope from Fortune and has little to fear from Fate,\r\n And little his dreams are troubled over the public’s love or hate.\r\n\r\n “So a rhyme to the old tramp-printer—to the hopes he has cherished and\r\n    wept,\r\n To the loves and the old home-voices that still in his heart are kept;\r\n A rhyme to the old tramp-printer, whose garments are shiny and thin,\r\n And who takes a bunk in the basement when the pressman lets him in.”\r\n\r\nMr. Mapes gravitated to Philadelphia to write for Colonel McClure’s\r\n_Times_. His are the appetizing paragraphs that burnish the editorial\r\npage by their subtile essence. He is a familiar figure at party\r\nconventions, which his intimate knowledge of state-politics enables him\r\nto gauge accurately. He abhors trickery and chicanery, deals his hardest\r\nblows in exposing corrupt methods, believes taxpayers and voters have\r\nrights contractors and bosses are bound to respect and is a stickler for\r\nhonest government. Williams also strayed to the Quaker City as\r\nparagrapher for the _Press_, making a phenomenal hit. James G. Blaine\r\ncomplimented Charles Emory Smith upon these tart, peppery nuggets,\r\nsaying: “I invariably read the _Press_ paragraphs before looking at any\r\nother paper.” This pleasant tribute added ten dollars a week to Sam’s\r\nsalary, yet he tired of Philadelphia years ago and glided back to his\r\nold home in “the Messer Diocese.” He is now connected with the New York\r\n_Mail and Express_, whose readers can hardly find words to express their\r\nsatisfaction with the spice he injects into Elliot Shepherd’s trusty\r\nexpositor of Republicanism.\r\n\r\n                His pointed squibs and his cranium bare\r\n                Are as much alike as steps in a stair—\r\n                One grows no moss and the other no hair.\r\n\r\nR. W. Criswell holds an honorable place among the men who have made\r\noil-region newspapers known abroad and influential at home. He was born\r\nin Clarion county and educated in Cincinnati. His sketches, signed\r\n“Chris,” introduced him to the public through the medium of the Oil-City\r\n_Derrick_, the East Brady _Independent_ and the Fairview _Independent_,\r\nColonel Samuel Young’s twin offspring. Retiring from Young’s employ at\r\nFairview, he was next heard of as traveling correspondent of the\r\nCincinnati _Enquirer_. His editorship of the _Derrick_ in 1877 clinched\r\nhis fame as a Simon-pure humorist, thirty-six inches to the yard and\r\none-hundred cents to the dollar. The Shakespearian parodies and\r\nLickshingle stories, lustrous as the Kohinoor, waltzed the merry round\r\nof the American press and were published in two taking books—“The New\r\nShakespeare” and “Grandfather Lickshingle.” After his departure from the\r\n_Petroleum World_ Criswell renewed his relations with the _Enquirer_ as\r\nmanaging-editor. He was John R. McLean’s trusty lieutenant and held the\r\ngreat western daily on the topmost rung of the ladder. The New-York\r\n_Graphic_, the pathfinder of illustrated dailies, needed him and he\r\naccepted its flattering offer. The Cincinnati _Sun_ was about to shine\r\non the just and the unjust and he returned to Porkopolis. Colonel John\r\nCockrell coaxed him back to Manhattanville to reconstruct the\r\nfunny-streak of the overflowing New-York _World_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  F. F. MURRAY.        JAMES M.

MAPES.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “LEND ME YOUR EARS.”]\r\n\r\nWhen the Colonel and Joseph Pulitzer disagreed—they “never spoke as they\r\npassed by”—he went with Cockrell to the _Commercial Advertiser_, for\r\nwhich he has done some of the brightest work in the newspaper-kingdom.\r\nHe now edits _Truth_. “Mark Anthony’s Oration Over Cæsar,” from “The\r\nComic Shakespeare,” will dispel the gloom and indicate the rare brand of\r\nCriswell’s vintage:\r\n\r\n “Friends, Romans, countrymen! lend me your ears;\r\n I will return them next Saturday. I come\r\n To bury Cæsar because the times are hard\r\n And his folks can’t afford to hire an undertaker.\r\n The evil that men do lives after them,\r\n In the shape of progeny, who reap\r\n The benefit of their life insurance.\r\n So let it be with the deceased.\r\n Brutus hath told you that Cæsar was ambitious,\r\n What does Brutus know about it?\r\n It is none of his funeral.\r\n But that it isn’t is no fault of the undersigned.\r\n Here under leave of you I come to\r\n Make a speech at Cæsar’s funeral.\r\n He was my friend, faithful and just to me;\r\n He loaned me five dollars once when I was in a pinch,\r\n And signed my petition for a post-office.\r\n And Brutus says he was ambitious.\r\n Brutus should chase himself around the block.\r\n Cæsar hath brought many captives home to Rome\r\n Who broke rock on the streets until their ransoms\r\n Did the general coffers fill.\r\n When that the poor hath cried, Cæsar hath wept,\r\n Because it didn’t cost anything\r\n And made him solid with the masses.    [_Cheers._\r\n Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.\r\n Yet Brutus says he was ambitious.\r\n Brutus is a liar, and I can prove it.\r\n You all did see that on the Lupercal\r\n I thrice presented him a kingly crown,\r\n Which he did thrice refuse, because it did not fit him quite.\r\n Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious.\r\n Brutus is not only the biggest liar in this country\r\n But is a politician of the deepest dye.    [_Applause._\r\n If you have tears prepare to shed them now.\r\n You all do know this ulster.     [_Laughter._\r\n I remember the first time ever Cæsar put it on;\r\n It was on a summer’s evening in his tent,\r\n With the thermometer registering ninety degrees in the shade;\r\n But it was an ulster to be proud of,\r\n And it cost him $3 at Marcalus Swartzheimer’s,\r\n Corner of Broad and Ferry streets, sign of the red flag.\r\n Old Swartz wanted $40 for it,\r\n But finally came down to $3, because it was Cæsar!\r\n Look! in this place ran Casca’s dagger through;\r\n Through this the son of a gun of a Brutus stabbed,\r\n And when he plucked his cursed steel away,\r\n Good gracious, how the blood of Cæsar followed it!\r\n\r\n [_Cheers, and cries of “Give us something on the Wilson bill!” “Hit him\r\n    again;” etc._]\r\n\r\n I came not, friends, to steal away your hearts;\r\n I am no thief as Brutus is.\r\n Brutus has a monopoly in all that business,\r\n And if he had his deserts, he would be\r\n In the State prison and don’t you forget it.\r\n Kind friends, sweet friends, I do not wish to stir you up\r\n To such a sudden flood of mutiny,\r\n And, as it looks like rain,\r\n The pallbearers will please place the body in the wheelbarrow\r\n And we will proceed to bury Cæsar,\r\n Not to praise him.”\r\n\r\nEdwin C. Bell, a son of the Pine-Tree state, landed at Petroleum Centre\r\nin 1866, spent 1869 in the west, returned to Oil Creek in 1870 and for\r\nthree years punched down oil-wells. In 1874 he started a job-printery at\r\nPioneer, using a press he built from iron-scraps and an oak-rail and\r\nlearning the trade without an instructor. That fall he transplanted his\r\nkit to Titusville and continued in the jobbing-line fourteen years.\r\nEarly in 1878 he published the _Leader_, a weekly that petered out in\r\ntwo months. Mr. Bell in 1882 flew the flag of the _Republic_, a\r\ncampaign-oracle of the Greenbackers and supporter of Thomas A. Armstrong\r\nfor governor. The _Republic_, like the _Argus_, the _Observer_ and\r\nothers of that ilk, didn’t attain old age. Bell’s first grists—stories\r\nand sketches—went into the _Courier_ hopper in 1872, supplemented from\r\n1878 to 1882 by bundles of live matter in the Meadville _Vindicator_ and\r\nthe Richburg _Echo_. He edited the _Republican_ at Casselton, N. D., in\r\n1882-3, and during the nine years following his return to Titusville\r\nsent a news-letter almost daily to the Oil-City _Blizzard_. He has long\r\ncontributed to the _Sunday World_ and in 1888-9 was its\r\nassistant-editor. In 1892 he began a history of the Pennsylvania\r\noil-regions, instalments of which the _Derrick_ printed, and he hopes to\r\nfinish the task on a comprehensive scale befitting the subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE A. NEEDLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEPHEN W. HARLEY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWIN C. BELL.]\r\n\r\nWarren has been blessed with two weeklies, the _Ledger_ and the _Mail_,\r\nfor two generations. Ephraim Cowan founded the _Mail_ in 1848 and owned\r\nit until his death in 1894. Three dailies vigilantly watch each other\r\nand guard the pretty town. At Tidioute the _Journal_, inaugurated by J.\r\nB. Close in 1867, jogged along seven years. George A. Needle and Frank\r\nH. Taylor were the owners. Needle, whose sharp lance could prick the\r\nfiends of the opposition like a needle, followed the tide to Parker and\r\nboosted the _Daily_, which shortly plunged into perpetual night. Its\r\nchief contributor was Stephen W. Harley, who furnished rich budgets of\r\nPetrolia odds and ends over the name of “Keno.” “Steve” was kindly,\r\nobliging, congenial and well-liked. Six summers have come and gone since\r\nhe was laid beneath the sod. Clark Wilson removed the _Oilman’s Journal_\r\nto Smethport and the _Phœnix_ is in undisputed possession of the\r\nParker territory, with the youngest editor—son of G. A. Needle—in the\r\nState guiding it capably. In October of 1874 the Warren-County _News_\r\nwas moved from Youngsville to Tidioute. C. E. White, who took charge in\r\nDecember, bought the plant in 1875 and he has been in the harness\r\ncontinuously since. Mr. White is among the best all-round newspaper-men\r\nin the country. He was born at Newburg in 1842, boyhooded at\r\nBinghampton, learned his trade at Elmira, served the Jamestown _Journal_\r\nsix years, spent a year with the Oil-City _Derrick_ and went to Tidioute\r\nin 1872 to manage the _Journal’s_ job-department. His record as a\r\ncitizen, soldier, printer and editor is solid nonpareil.\r\n\r\nClarion county did not escape the frantic rush to stick a paper in every\r\nmushroom-town. F. H. Barclay inflicted the _Record_ on the\r\nlong-suffering St. Petersburgers, mooring his bark in California when\r\nthe paper turned up its toes. Tozer’s _Crude-Local_, which never sported\r\na crude-local or editorial, the Fern-City _Illuminator_, brighter in\r\nname than in real substance, the Clarion _Banner_, a species of rag on\r\nthe bush, the Edenburg _National Record_ and several more slid off the\r\nperch with a dull thud, fatal as Humpty Dumpty’s irretrievable tumble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: P. A. RATTIGAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN H. NEGLEY.]\r\n\r\nFrank A. Herr’s _Record_ has long kept up a good record at Petrolia.\r\nColonel Young and the three papers he propagated in Butler county, with\r\na half-dozen elsewhere, have mouldered into dust. He was intensely\r\nearnest and industrious, able to maintain his end of a discussion and\r\nseldom unwilling to dare opponents knock the chip off his stout\r\nshoulder. Rev. W. A. Thorne attempted to reform the race with his\r\nGreece-City _Review_, hauling the traps to Millerstown upon the\r\ndepletion of the frontier-town. His path was strewn with thorns, mankind\r\nresenting his review of everybody and everything. Ex-Postmaster Rattigan\r\nbraces up the unterrified with his sturdy Chicora _Herald_, which he has\r\nconducted successfully for twenty years. St. Joe’s bantam, never\r\ndistinguished for its strength, crowed mildly and dropped from the\r\nroost. The county-seat is fully stocked with political organs, the\r\n_Citizen_, the _Eagle_ and the _Herald_ coaching their respective\r\nparties. J. H. Negley & Son are not negligent in their conduct of the\r\n_Citizen_. The _Eagle_ is the proud bird of Thomas H. Robertson, a\r\ntrained writer and journalist, now Superintendent of Public-Printing in\r\nHarrisburg. The _Herald_ was for many years the pet of Jacob Zeigler, to\r\nwhom all Butlerites took off their hats. “Uncle Jake” was the soul of\r\nthe social circle, a treasury of wit and wisdom, an exhaustless\r\nreservoir of pat stories, a mine of practical knowledge and a welcome\r\nguest in every corner of Pennsylvania. His soubriquet of “Uncle”\r\nfastened upon him in a curious way. At the funeral of a youthful\r\nacquaintance the distracted mother, as her boy was consigned to the\r\ngrave, in a frenzy of grief laid her head upon young Zeigler’s breast\r\nand exclaimed: “Oh, were you ever a stricken mother?” “No, madam,” was\r\nthe cool reply, “but I expect to be an uncle before sundown to-morrow.”\r\nBystanders noted the strange incident and thenceforth the “Uncle” stuck\r\nlike a fly-blister. His parents are buried in the Harrisburg cemetery,\r\nnear Joseph Jefferson’s father, and whenever he visited the capital he\r\nstrewed their resting-place with flowers. Who can doubt that the filial\r\nson, in whom mingled the strength of a man and the tenderness of a\r\nwoman, found his loved ones not far away when he entered the pearly\r\ngates? Truly “this was the noblest Roman of them all.”\r\n\r\nAnother honored resident of Butler was Samuel P. Irvin, author of “The\r\nOil-Bubble,” a pamphlet abounding with delicious satire and bits of\r\npersonal experience. It was printed in 1868 and produced a sensation.\r\nEnjoying very few advantages in his boyhood, Mr. Irvin was emphatically\r\na self-made man. Born in a backwoods-township seventy years ago, his\r\nschooling was limited and he toiled “down on the farm.” Like Lincoln,\r\nGarfield, Simon Cameron and many other country-boys, he rose to\r\ndistinction by his own exertions. He read assiduously, studied law and\r\nstood well at the bar. His literary bent found expression in\r\nnewspaper-articles of very high grade. He lived some years at Franklin\r\nin the earlier stages of petroleum-developments, drilling wells and\r\nhandling oil-properties on commission. He met death with fortitude,\r\n“like one who wraps the drapery of his couch about him and lies down to\r\npleasant dreams.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SAMUEL P. IRVIN.\r\n  JACOB ZEIGLER.\r\n  SAMUEL YOUNG.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Bradford semi-weekly _New Era_, harbinger of the new era dawning\r\nupon McKean county, saw daylight in the spring of 1875. The main object\r\nof its founder, Colonel J. H. Haffey, was to invite attention to the\r\npossibilities of the locality as a prospective oil-field. Colonel Haffey\r\nwas a man of varied talents—public speaker, writer, soldier, surveyor,\r\npromoter of oil-enterprises, rail-roader and expounder of the gospel.\r\nIrish by birth, he came to America at fourteen, lived three years in\r\nCanada, was licensed to preach and in 1851, at the age of twenty-one,\r\naccepted a call to the Baptist church at Bradford, then Littleton.\r\nMarrying Diantha, youngest daughter of Nathan De Golier, in December of\r\n1852, a year later he quit the pulpit, sensibly concluding that the Lord\r\nhad not called him to starve his family. As surveyor and geologist, he\r\nwas employed to prospect for coal and iron in McKean and adjacent\r\ncounties. In 1858-9 he had charge of a gang of men grading the Erie\r\nrailroad to Buttsville. The first man in Bradford township to enlist in\r\n1861, he raised a force for Colonel Kane’s famous “Bucktails,” shared in\r\nthe fighting around Richmond and was honorably discharged with the rank\r\nof major. Governor Hartranft appointed him a member of his staff and the\r\ntitle of colonel resulted. He sold his Bradford home in 1877 and removed\r\nto Beverly, N.J., where his active, helpful career ended in November,\r\n1881.\r\n\r\nFerrin & Weber, of Salamanca, publishers of the Cattaraugas\r\n_Republican_, in 1876 bought the _New Era_ from Col. Haffey and placed\r\nit in charge of Charles F. Persons. He had been in their establishment\r\nat Little Valley two years. For nine or ten months he washed rollers,\r\nfed presses, carried wood and did the varied chores allotted to the\r\n“printer’s devil.” His aptitude impressed his employers, who sent him\r\nfirst to Salamanca and then to Bradford, an important post for a youth\r\nof twenty-two. Hoping to be an editor some day, he had corresponded for\r\nneighboring papers from boyhood on his father’s farm, a practice he\r\nmaintained during his apprenticeship. A few months after reaching\r\nBradford he and the Salamanca firm established the _Daily Era_, with the\r\nnames of Ferrin, Weber & Persons at the mast-head. Very soon Persons\r\nbought out his partners and conducted the paper alone. His ability and\r\nenergy had full play. The _Era_ met the demands of the eager, restless\r\ncrowds that thronged the streets of Bradford and scoured the hills in\r\nquest of territory. Its news was concise and fresh, its oil-reports were\r\nnot doctored for speculative ends, it had opinions and presented them\r\ntersely. Persons sold to W. H. Longwell and W. F. Jordan early in 1879\r\nand in the fall bought the Olean _Democrat_. The nobby New-York town was\r\nfeeling the stimulus of oil-operations and he started the _Daily\r\nHerald_, enhancing his wallet and well-won reputation. The American\r\nPress-Association, which furnishes plate-matter to thousands of\r\nnewspapers, secured him in 1888 as Local Manager of its New-York office.\r\nTwo years ago he was promoted to General Eastern-Manager and in 1894 was\r\nelected Secretary, Assistant General-Manager and one of the five\r\ndirectors. Mr. Persons occupies a snug home in Brooklyn, with his wife\r\nand two little daughters. He is a live representative of the go-ahead,\r\nenterprising, sagacious, executive American.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COL. J. H. HAFFEY.\r\n  D. A. DENNISON.          CHAS. F. PERSONS.\r\n  THOMAS A. KERN.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLongwell & Jordan also bought the _Breeze_—it first breathed the\r\noil-laden air of Bradford in 1878 and was edited by David Armstrong,\r\n“organizer” of the producers in one of their movements to “get\r\ntogether”—and consolidated it with the _Era_. Col. Edward Stuck, of\r\nYork, worked the combination successfully some months. Colonel Leander\r\nM. Morton was night-editor until his lamented death. Thomas A. Kern\r\nattended to the field, preparing the “monthly reports” and posting\r\nreaders on oil-developments in his bailiwick. Years have flown since\r\npoor “Tom,” young and enthusiastic, and J. K. Graham, exact and upright,\r\nresponded to the message that brooks no excuse or postponement. “Musing\r\non companions gone, we doubly feel ourselves alone.” Bradshaw, McMullen\r\nand others scattered. Jordan, whose first work for papers was done at\r\nPetrolia in 1873, died in Harrisburg in 1897. P. C. Boyle secured the\r\n_Era_ and infused into it much of his own prompt, courageous spirit.\r\nDavid A. Dennison has for years been its efficient editor. His parents\r\nremoved from Connecticut to a farm south of Titusville when he was a\r\nbaby. At thirteen David wrote a batch of items, which it tickled him to\r\nsee in print, without a thought of one day blossoming into a\r\nfull-fledged “literary feller.” Not caring to be a tiller of the soil,\r\nhe juggled the hammer and lathe in machine-shops to the music of “the\r\nAnvil Chorus.” A short season on the boards convinced him that he was\r\nnot commissioned to elevate the stage and wrest the scepter from Edwin\r\nBooth, Lawrence Barrett, John McCullough or Alexander Salvini. He\r\nwhisked to a Bradford shop to strike the iron while it was hot, writing\r\nsmart descriptions of oil-region scenes for outside papers as a\r\nside-issue for several years. A series of his articles on gas-monopoly,\r\nin the Elmira _Telegram_, brought reduced rates to consumers and\r\npleasant notoriety to the ironworker, who had proved himself a\r\nblacksmith with the sledge and no “blacksmith” with the quill. His name\r\nwas neither Dennis nor Mud, and the _Daily Oil News_, McMullen &\r\nBradshaw’s game-fowl, wanted him forthwith. The salary was not alluring\r\nand in the Indian-summer days of 1886 he cast in his lot with the _Era_.\r\nPromotion chased him persistently. From reporter he was boosted to\r\ncity-editor and in 1894 to the editorial management, a flawless\r\nselection. He has tussled with all sorts of topics, constructed tales of\r\nwoe in jingling verse and even tempted fate by firing off a drama, which\r\nhas not yet run the gamut of publicity. Dennison has been offered good\r\nsits in metropolitan offices, but he likes Bradford and clings to the\r\n_Era_. He married Miss Katharine Grady in 1883 and three boys gladden\r\nthe home of the exultant D. A. D. “May his shadow never grow less.”\r\n\r\nE. W. Butler started the Bradford _Sunday News_ on April first, 1879,\r\nwith Joseph Moorhead as editor. Mr. Moorhead grew up on a farm near\r\nNewcastle, served in the army as captain in Matthew Stanley Quay’s\r\nregiment, landed at Petroleum Centre in 1869, worked about oil-wells\r\nfive years, taught school at St. Petersburg in 1874-5, published a\r\nshort-lived fraternal paper at Newcastle in 1870, aided in editing the\r\nMillerstown _Review_ and in 1878 filled a position on the Bradford\r\n_Era_. He edited the Sunday News one year, helped launch a similar sheet\r\nat Minneapolis, returned to Bradford in 1880, resumed his position a few\r\nmonths and resigned to edit the _Sunday-Mail_. Early in 1885 he settled\r\nin Kansas, farming there five years and coming back to Pennsylvania in\r\n1890. Since that time he has lived in Pittsburg and been connected with\r\nvarious dailies of the sooty city. His vigor and experience are\r\nmanifested in his writings, which always go direct to the spot. At\r\nsixty-two the veteran unites the activity of buoyant youth with the\r\nwisdom of robust age. Butler reeled off the Buffalo _Sunday-News_ in\r\n1880, the sharpest, quickest, breeziest afternoon-paper in the Bison\r\nCity, and in 1885 sold his Bradford bantling to Philip H. Lindeman,\r\n_Era_ book-keeper and manager. Lindeman navigated against wind and tide\r\nuntil the _News_ ran ashore in 1894, the “Commodore” himself ending\r\nlife’s voyage in June of 1897.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH MOORHEAD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.F. BARBER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD C. JONES.]\r\n\r\nA number of producers agreeing to stand sponsors for the bills, McMullen\r\n& Bradshaw floated the _Daily News_ in 1886. Its backers grew tired of\r\nemptying their pockets and the bright venture gave up the ghost. Eben\r\nBrewer’s _Evening Star_ tinted the sky under its founder’s artistic\r\ntouch. He sold to Andrew Carr, who found the load unbearable and shoved\r\nit upon Rufus B. Stone, brother of Congressman Charles W. Stone. Mr.\r\nStone, an able lawyer, was Chancellor of Mississippi in the\r\nreconstruction-days. The reconstructed legislature lopped off his salary\r\nand he located at Bradford to practice law. He owned the _Star_ several\r\nyears, writing most of the political editorials that carried weight and\r\ngave the paper high standing. H. F. Barber, a man of fine intellect and\r\nnoble purpose, dropped the Smethport _Miner_, relieved Stone and honed\r\nthe _Star_ a few years, assisted at times by George Allen’s clever\r\nstroke. Protracted sickness, during which he showed “how sublime it is\r\nto suffer and be strong,” at last “withered the garlands on his brow.”\r\nHe is dead, but “his speaking dust has more of life than half its\r\nbreathing moulds.” Allen slid to Buffalo to polish up a\r\nrailroad-periodical. “Judge” Johnson—in 1875 he landed at Bradford,\r\nserved a term in the Legislature and another as postmaster, operated in\r\noil and died three years ago—controlled the _Star_ after Barber, whose\r\nwidow still retains an interest in the paper. Ex-Senator Emery fitted\r\nout the _Daily Record_, which seeks to trail the standard of the\r\nStandard in the dust and ticket independent producers, refiners and\r\npipe-liners to a petroleum-Utopia. “Ed.” Jones, the adept who toed the\r\nchalk-mark on the Harrisburg _Call_, whirled the emery-wheel so expertly\r\nthat the _Record_ has never approached Davy Jones’s locker. It is snappy\r\nand full of fight as a shillaleh at Donnybrook Fair. Carr’s\r\n_Sunday-Mail_, freighted with a car of delicate morsels, barked up the\r\nwrong tree and went to the bow-wows. Carr rolled down to Pittsburg to\r\nsell buggies, bagging a cargo of ducats. “Tom” L. Wilson—he’s as\r\nhumorous as they make ’em—got out three numbers of _Sunday Morning_, a\r\nfour-page blanket in size and a ten-course banquet in contents. Col. Ege\r\nshut it down for publishing a rank extract from Walt Whitman’s “Blades\r\no’ Grass” and boomed the _Evening-Times_, which expired in infancy. Ege\r\nwas a banker who hankered to be State-Treasurer, banked upon\r\nnewspaper-support, went into bankruptcy, received an appointment in the\r\nPhiladelphia Mint and traveled westward when Cleveland shuffled the pack\r\nfor a new deal. Wilson wrote for the oil-region press, handled the\r\nReading branch of a Harrisburg paper, edited the Washington\r\n_Review_—Sistersville has a sisterly _Review_ now—and rounded up in\r\nBuffalo. The _Post_, Bradford’s latest Sunday experiment, owes its good\r\nlooks and good matter to Edward F. McIntyre and George O. Sloan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  J.C. McMULLEN.\r\n  A.L. SNELL.         W.C. ARMOR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne evening in 1877 a young stranger walked into the St. Petersburg\r\npost-office, bought a package of stationery at the book-counter and told\r\nJ. M. Place he was looking for a situation. Place hired him as a clerk.\r\nHe had come from the homestead farm in Orange county, N. Y., to Cornell\r\nUniversity, worked his way and graduated in civil-engineering. Marshall\r\nSwartzwelder lectured at St. Petersburg on temperance and Place’s clerk\r\nsat up all night to report the masterpiece for the _Derrick_. It was his\r\nfirst production in print, a voluntary act on his part, and the article\r\nattracted most favorable notice. Its author was at once offered a\r\nposition on the _Derrick_. He came in contact with oil-statistics and\r\nhis real genius asserted itself. His painstaking, conscientious reports\r\nwere accepted as strictly reliable. He would trudge over the hills, wade\r\nthrough miles of mud and ford swollen streams to ascertain the precise\r\nstatus of an important well, rather than approximate it from hearsay.\r\nThis care and thoroughness gave the highest value to the statistical\r\nwork of Justus C. McMullen. In 1879 he went to Bradford and worked on\r\nthe _Breeze_, the _Era_ and the _Star_, always with the same devotion\r\nthat was a ruling maxim of his life. In 1883 he scouted in Warren and\r\nForest counties and became part owner of the _Petroleum Age_. Alfred L.\r\nSnell and Major W. C. Armor were associated with him in this admirable\r\nmonthly, of which he became sole proprietor on the first of December,\r\n1887. A. C. Crum, now on the editorial staff of the Pittsburg\r\n_Dispatch_, contributed many a newsy crumb to the _Age_. A newsboy at\r\nPickwick hailed me in front of his stand one cool morning and asked—not\r\nin a Pickwickian sense—if it would be worth while to get somebody to\r\nsend locals to the _Derrick_. “Why not do it yourself?” was my answer.\r\nHe tried and he succeeded. His work expanded and improved and he adopted\r\njournalism permanently. He catered for Oil City and Bradford papers,\r\nspun yarns for Pittsburg dailies and was a legislative correspondent\r\nseveral sessions. Snell, a statistical hummer and hard-to-beat purveyor\r\nof news, hangs his manuscript on the _Derrick_ hook. Armor sponsored a\r\nhistoric book and laid off his armor to second Dr. Egle in the State\r\nLibrary. He has a book-store in Harrisburg and a museum that distances\r\nthe “Old Curiosity Shop.” McMullen established and edited the _Daily\r\nOil-News_ in 1886. He died of pleurisy, contracted from exposure in\r\ncollecting oil-data, on January thirty-first, 1888, cut off at\r\nthirty-seven. The _Petroleum Age_ did not stay long behind its\r\nunswerving projector. Justus C. McMullen is enshrined in the affections\r\nof the people. An unrelenting foe of oppression, he had a warm heart for\r\nthe poor and pursued his own path of right through thorns or flowers. He\r\nmarried Miss Cora, daughter of Col. L. M. Morton, who lives in Bradford\r\nand has one little girl. A brave, grand, exalted spirit passed from\r\nearth when J. C. McMullen’s light was quenched.\r\n\r\n                                      “On the sands of life\r\n            Sorrow treads heavily and leaves a print\r\n            Time cannot wash away.”\r\n\r\nParker has been called “the graveyard of newspapers,” yet G. A. Needle\r\nhas run his popular _Phœnix_ twenty-three years, accumulating\r\nsufficient wealth to own a book-store and oil-wells and let the paper\r\ncanter along under charge of his son, the youngest editor in\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FULTON PHILLIPS.]\r\n\r\nThe Washington _Reporter_, established in 1892 as a daily and\r\nsemi-weekly, owes its abundant success largely to the wide-awake editor,\r\nWilliam Christman. His practical knowledge and ready pen keeps the\r\n_Reporter_ right in the swim. Fulton Phillips in 1888 launched the\r\n_Outlook_ at McDonald, then merely a flag-station on the Panhandle\r\nRailway, with no great outlook in prospect. His editorials are\r\nessentially independent and vigorous, the man dominating the paper. It\r\nis Fulton Phillips, rather than the paper, who is read and quoted by the\r\nthousands of _Outlook_ readers. He was born within a mile of McDonald\r\nand the boom following oil-operations did not catch the tall editor—he\r\nis considerably above six feet—napping. The _Outlook_ was the first to\r\nput a reporter in the field and write up the wells in picturesque style.\r\nPhillips served through the war, taught school at Pittsburg, ran a paper\r\nat Canonsburg, drifted westward, did editorial work in Missouri and\r\nCalifornia and returned to start the only failure in his pilgrimage, a\r\ntemperance-organ at Washington. It went the way of former\r\ntemperance-sheets in the local-option town where they take theirs in\r\njugs. In other portions of the oil-world journalism holds up its end\r\ncreditably, newspapers and developments marching neck and neck on their\r\ngrand errand of enlightenment. The Sistersville _Review_ and Parkersburg\r\n_Sentinel_ do the West-Virginia field proud, the Toledo _Journal_ is\r\nalways primed with Ohio oil-news, nor is there a spot in which oil plays\r\ntrump that literature does not hold a royal flush. Intelligence and\r\npetroleum are a good pair to tie to, to bet on and to rake in the\r\njack-pot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REV. S. J. M. EATON, D.D.]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. S. J. M. Eaton—his name is ever spoken with\r\nreverence—thirty-three years pastor of the Presbyterian church at\r\nFranklin, filled a large place in the literary guild. He loved\r\nespecially to delve into old books and papers and letters pertaining to\r\nthe pioneers of Northwestern Pennsylvania. His faithful labors in this\r\nneglected nook unearthed a troop of traditions and facts which “the\r\nworld will not willingly let die.” For the “History of Venango County”\r\nhe furnished a number of leading chapters. His published works include\r\n“Petroleum,” an epitome of oil-affairs down to 1866, “Lakeside,” a tale\r\nbased upon his father’s ministerial experiences in the wilds of Erie\r\ncounty, biographies of eminent divines, sketches of the Erie Presbytery,\r\npamphlets and sermons. “The Holy City” and “Palestine,” embodying his\r\nobservations in the orient, were issued as text-books by the Chautauqua\r\nCircle. Dr. Eaton was my near neighbor for years and hours in his\r\nwell-stocked library, enriched by his “affluence of discursive talk,”\r\nare recalled with deep satisfaction. On the sixteenth of July, 1889,\r\nwhile walking along the street, he raised his hands suddenly and fell to\r\nthe pavement, struck down by heart-failure. “He was not, for God took\r\nhim” to wear the victor’s crown. Farewell, “until the day dawn and the\r\nshadows flee away.”\r\n\r\nIn the Franklin office of the Galena Oil-Works are three successful\r\nweavers of rich textures in the literary loom—Dr. Frank H. Johnston, E.\r\nH. Sibley and Samuel H. Gray. Dr. Johnston was born in Canal township,\r\nreared on a farm, severely wounded in battling for the Union, studied\r\nmedicine, practiced at Cochranton and in 1872 located at Petrolia. There\r\n“he first essayed to write” for the Oil-City _Derrick_. From the very\r\noutset his articles were up to concert-pitch. Abandoning medicine for\r\nletters, he acquired a thorough knowledge of stenography, read the\r\nchoicest books and wrote in his best vein for the press. He represented\r\nthe _Derrick_ as its Franklin correspondent with credit to himself and\r\nthe paper. For sixteen years he has been connected with the Galena\r\nOil-Works as secretary of Hon. Charles Miller, a place demanding the\r\nsuperior qualifications with which the doctor is unstintingly endowed.\r\n\r\nEdwin Henry Sibley, born at Bath, N. Y., in 1857, is a brother of Hon.\r\nJoseph C. Sibley and has resided in Franklin twenty-three years. He was\r\ngraduated from Cornell University in 1880. For several years he has been\r\ntreasurer of the Galena Oil-Works and manager of Miller & Sibley’s\r\nfamous Prospect-Hill Stock-Farm, positions of responsibility to which\r\nhis personal address, his training and his business-methods adapt him\r\npre-eminently. Three years in succession he has been unanimously elected\r\nPresident of the Pennsylvania Jersey-Cattle Club. He has been active and\r\nefficient in promoting the laudable work of the University Extension\r\nSociety. Under guise of “Polybius Crusoe Smith, Sage of Cranberry\r\nCross-Roads”—the Smiths are big folks since the by-play of Pocahontas—he\r\ncontributes to _Puck_ and other well-known publications humorous\r\narticles and short, quaint, pithy sayings. These display a keen insight\r\ninto human nature and rare gift of happy, accurate expression. One of\r\nhis recent effusions—an address welcoming the delegates to an\r\nagricultural convention—is a bit of burlesque that deserves to rank with\r\nArtemus Ward’s brightest efforts or the richest paragraphs in the Biglow\r\nPapers. A few buds plucked at random from the flowery mead will serve to\r\nillustrate the high-class stamp of Mr. Sibley’s work in the field his\r\ngenius adorns. They are literary nosegays from his terse observations as\r\na philosophic “looker-on in Vienna:”\r\n\r\n“The wife that manages her husband is a genius, the one that bosses him\r\nis a tartar, the one that fights him is a fool, while the one that does\r\nnone of them is now as much out of fashion as her grandmother’s\r\nwedding-gown.”\r\n\r\n“The pygmies of Africa are such by nature, but elsewhere they are\r\nproduced artificially by a diet of petty and envious thoughts.”\r\n\r\n“‘Truth is mighty and will prevail,’ but Error generally has the better\r\nof it till the seventy-seventh round.”\r\n\r\n“One of the greatest evils that humanity has to contend with is that so\r\nmany icebergs have floated down from the North Pole and persist in\r\npassing themselves off for men.”\r\n\r\n“Former lovers in making out their title-deeds of the heart to their\r\nsuccessors always reserve at least a narrow pathway across a corner.”\r\n\r\n“Wise men and fools have foolish thoughts; fools tell them, wise men\r\nkeep them to themselves.”\r\n\r\n“Parents that haven’t time to correct their children when they are small\r\nhave time to weep over them when they are grown.”\r\n\r\n“Affectation (alias of Deceitfulness) has three picked cronies from whom\r\nshe is seldom separated. Their names are False Pride, Weakmindedness and\r\nBad Temper.”\r\n\r\n“If one has too much vitality in his brains he can get rid of it by\r\ntaking them out and boiling them. If he finds this too much bother, he\r\ncan accomplish the same result by swallowing a few doses of a decoction\r\nof faith-cure, spook-lore and hypnotism.”\r\n\r\n“For peace of mind and length of days, put this inscription above the\r\ndoorway of workshop and home: _Troubles that will not be worth worrying\r\nover seven years hence are not worth worrying over now._”\r\n\r\n“The ancient Israelites once worshiped a golden calf, but the modern\r\nAmericans would worship a golden polecat if they couldn’t get the gold\r\nin any other form to worship.”\r\n\r\n“The young man who starts out in life with character and brains and\r\nenergy as his outfit will distance the one whose sole capital is the\r\nmoney his father left him.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  E. H. SIBLEY.\r\n         S. H. GRAY.\r\n  F. H. JOHNSTON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSamuel H. Gray carries under his hat plenty of the gray-matter that\r\nmakes bright writers and bright wooers of the Muses. He has been court\r\nstenographer of Venango county and holds a confidential position with\r\nthe firm of Miller & Sibley, applying his spare moments to\r\nnewspaper-writing. His pictures of petroleum-traits and incidents are\r\nfinished word-paintings, with “light and shade and color properly\r\ndisposed.” Like Silas Wegg, he “drops into poetry” in a friendly way.\r\nSuch papers as the New-York _Truth_ strive for his emanations, which\r\nsavor of Bret Harte and “hold the mirror up to nature” in oleaginous\r\ncircles. Judge of this “By the Order of the Lord,” founded on an actual\r\noccurrence in Scrubgrass township:\r\n\r\n  “It was back, if I remember, in the year of sixty-five,\r\n  When we formed a part and parcel of that rushin’, busy hive\r\n  That extended from Oil City up the crooked crick until\r\n  It reached its other endin’ in the town of Titusville;\r\n  When every rock an’ hillside was included in a lease,\r\n  An’ everyone was huntin’ fer the fortune-makin’ grease;\r\n  When a poor man pushed and elbowed ’gainst the oily millionaire,\r\n  An’ ‘the devil take the hindmost’ seemed the all-pervadin’ prayer.\r\n\r\n  “An’ we hed formed a pardnership, jest Tom an’ Jim an’ me,\r\n  That was properly recorded as the ‘Tough and Hungry Three,’\r\n  An’ hed gone an’ leased a portion of some hard an’ rocky soil\r\n  That we thought looked like the cover of a fountain filled with oil.\r\n  An’ we set the drill a’goin’ on its long an’ greasy quest,\r\n  That meant so much or little to the capital possessed.\r\n  Our money was all in the well, in Providence our trust,\r\n  An’ we waited for a fortune, or to liquidate an’ bu’st.\r\n\r\n  “An’ while the drill was chuggin’ at its hard an’ rocky way\r\n  We three would hold a meetin’ at a certain time each day,\r\n  The ‘resolves’ an’ the ‘whereases’ that the secretary took\r\n  Were properly recorded ’twixt the covers of a book.\r\n  An’ we passed a resolution by a vote unanimous\r\n  Thet if Providence would condescend to sorter favor us,\r\n  An’ assist the operations on the ‘Tough and Hungry’ lease,\r\n  We would give to Him a quarter of the total flow of grease.\r\n\r\n  “Next day the drill broke through into a very oily sand\r\n  An’ Providence remembered us with strong, unsparin’ hand;\r\n  The oil came out with steady flow an’ loaded up the tanks,\r\n  An’ the Lord was due rewarded by a solid vote of thanks.\r\n  A resolution then came up thet caused the vote to split,\r\n  A sort of an amendment, readin’ somethin’ like, to wit—\r\n  ‘Whereas, a tenth is all the Lord was ever known to crave,\r\n  Resolved we give it to Him; but resolved the rest we save.’\r\n\r\n  “I fit that resolution, an’ I fit it tooth an’ nail,\r\n  Spoke of dangers such proceedin’s was most likely to entail;\r\n  But two votes were in its favor, an’ two votes it only took\r\n  Fer to have it due recorded in the resolution-book.\r\n  Next day the oil stopped flowin’ an’ it never flowed no more,\r\n  An’ the ‘Tough and Hungry’ combine was a’ feelin’ blue an’ sore.\r\n  But they nailed upon the derrick this notice, on a board,\r\n  ‘This well has stopped proceedin’s, by the order of the Lord.’”\r\n\r\nThe late Rev. Harry L. Yewens, rector of St. John’s church, was an\r\naccomplished writer and contributed many timely articles to the press.\r\nRev. Dr. Fradenburg, formerly of Oil City and Franklin, has published\r\nseven scholarly volumes on religious subjects of vital interest.\r\n\r\nThe Bolivar _Breeze_, seven years old, under the able management of J.\r\nP. Herrick is one of the most readable sheets published in any section\r\nof the country. Editor Herrick is a philosopher and wit, who looks on\r\nthe bright side of life and, better still, helps others to do likewise.\r\n\r\nP. A. Rattigan, the very-much-alive perpetrator of the Millerstown\r\n_Herald_, once received an article entitled “Why Do I Live?” It was\r\nwritten on both sides of the sheet of foolscap, whereupon P. Anthony in\r\nnext issue printed this conclusive answer: “You live because you sent\r\nyour dog-goned rot by mail instead of bringing it in person.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MELVILLE J. KERR.]\r\n\r\nMelville J. Kerr, a Franklin boy, son of the senior proprietor of the\r\nmarble-works, is a popular writer of facetiæ and society small-talk.\r\nPossibly “a rose by any other name would smell as sweet,” but his\r\ncognomen of “Joe Ker” is known to thousands of smiling readers who never\r\nheard of Melville. The aspiring youth, believing in the advantages of a\r\nbig city, journeyed to New York to look for an opportunity that might\r\nwant a party about his size and style. Unlike Jacob for Rachel, Penelope\r\nfor Ulysses, the zealots who prayed for Ingersoll’s conversion or the\r\nGovernor of South Carolina for the Governor of North Carolina to “fill\r\n’em up again,” he didn’t wait long. A soap-mogul liked the ambitious,\r\nsprightly young man, introduced him to the swell set and booked him as\r\neditor of _The Club_. Kerr’s refined humor popped and effervesced with\r\nmore “bead” than ever. He hobnobbed with millionaires, delighted Ward\r\nMcAlister and married a lovely girl. Blood will tell as surely as a\r\ngossip or a tale-bearer. He is now editing _The Yellow Kid_, a\r\nsemi-monthly crowded with good things, and raking in wealth at a\r\nKlondyke-gait from his newest book, “The World Over,” a graphic and\r\ngeographic burlesque that is fated to be read the world over. And this\r\nis how the “Joe Ker” is the winning card in one oil-region instance.\r\n\r\nLast year a compact “Life of Napoleon Bonaparte,” in harmony with the\r\nage of steam and electricity that won’t winnow a bushel of chaff for a\r\ngrain of wheat, which had run through the winter and spring of 1894-5 in\r\n_McClure’s Magazine_, was published in book-form. Napoleonic ground had\r\nbeen so plowed and harrowed and raked and scraped and sifted by Hugo,\r\nScott, Abbott, Hazlitt, Bourrienne, Madame Junot and a host of smaller\r\nfry that it seemed idle to expect anything new concerning the arbiter of\r\nEurope. Yet the beauty and freshness and acumen of this “Life” surprised\r\nand captivated its myriad readers, whose pleasure it increased to learn\r\nthat the book was the production of a young woman. The authoress is Miss\r\nIda M., daughter of Franklin S. Tarbell, a wealthy oil-operator. Her\r\nchildhood was spent at Rouseville, where her parents lived prior to\r\noccupying their present home at Titusville. The romantic surroundings\r\nwere calculated to awaken glowing fancies in the acute mind of the\r\nlittle girl. After graduating from Allegheny College, Meadville, she\r\ntaught in the seminary at Poland, O., assisted to edit _The Chautauquan_\r\nat Meadville and spent three years in Europe gathering materials for\r\narticles on the dark days of Robespierre, Danton, Marat and Marie\r\nAntoinette. She wrote for _Scribners’_, _McClure’s_ and the _New-England\r\nMagazine_, adding to her fame by an exhaustive study of Abraham\r\nLincoln’s youth. _Scribners’_ will soon publish her biography of Madame\r\nRoland, the heroine of the French Revolution. Her success thus early in\r\nher career gives fruitful promise of a resplendent future for the\r\nvivacious, winsome biographer of the “Little Corporal.”\r\n\r\nWhile many names and terms and phrases peculiar to oil-operations are\r\nunintelligible to the tenderfoot as “the confusion of tongues” at Babel,\r\nothers will be valuable additions to the language. “He has the sand”\r\naptly describes a gritty, invincible character. The fortunate adventurer\r\n“strikes oil,” the pompous strutter is “a big gasser,” foolish anger is\r\n“pumping roily” and fruitless enterprise is “boring in dry territory.”\r\nMisdirected effort is “off the belt,” failure “stops the drill,” a lucky\r\ninvestment “hits the jugular,” a hindrance “sticks the tools” and an\r\nabandoned effort “plugs the well.” A man or well that keeps at it is “a\r\nstayer,” one that doesn’t pan out is “a duster,” one that cuts loose is\r\n“a gusher” or “a spouter.” Fair promise means “a good show,” the owner\r\nof pipe-line certificates “has a bundle,” fleeced speculators are “shorn\r\nlambs”—not limited to Oildom by a large majority—and the ruined operator\r\n“shuts ’er down.” In a moment of inspiration John P. Zane created “the\r\nnoble producer,” Lewis F. Emery invented “the downtrodden refiner” and\r\nSamuel P. Irvin exploited “the Great Invisible Oil-Company.” Some of\r\nthese epigrammatic phrases deserve to go thundering down the ages with\r\nGrant’s “let us have peace,” Cleveland’s “pernicious activity,” and “a\r\nsucker is born every minute.”\r\n\r\nNor is the jargon of places and various appliances devoid of interest to\r\nthe student of letters. Oil City, Petroleum Centre, Oleopolis, Petrolia,\r\nGreece City—first spelled G-r-e-a-s-e—Gas City, Derrick City and Oil\r\nSprings were named with direct reference to the slippery commodity. From\r\nprominent operators came Funkville, Shamburg, Tarr Farm, Rouseville,\r\nMcClintockville, Fagundas, Prentice, Cochran, Karns City, Angelica,\r\nCriswell City, Gillmor, Duke Centre and Dean City. Noted men or early\r\nsettlers were remembered in Titusville, Shaffer, Plumer, Trunkeyville,\r\nWarren, Irvineton, McKean, De Golier, Custer City, Garfield, Franklin,\r\nReno, Foster, Cooperstown, Kennerdell, Milton, Foxburg, Pickwick,\r\nParker, Troutman, Butler, Washington, Mannington and Morgantown.\r\nEmlenton commemorates Mrs. Emlon Fox. St. Joe recalls Joseph Oberly, a\r\npioneer-operator in that portion of Butler county. Standoff City kept\r\ngreen a contractor who wished to “stand-off” his men’s wages until he\r\nfinished a well. A deep hole or pit on the bank of the creek, from which\r\nair rushed, suggested Pithole. Tip-Top, near Pleasantville, signified\r\nits elevated site. Cornplanter, the township in which Oil City is\r\nsituated, bears the name of the stalwart chief—six feet high and one\r\nhundred years old—to whom the land was ceded for friendly services to\r\nthe government and the white settlers. This grand old warrior died in\r\n1836 and the Legislature erected a monument over his grave, on the\r\nIndian reservation near Kinzua. Venango, Tionesta, Conewago, Allegheny,\r\nModoc and Kanawha smack of the copper-hued savage once monarch of the\r\nwhole plantation. Red-Hot, Hardscrabble, Bullion, Babylon, St.\r\nPetersburg, Fairview, Antwerp, Dogtown, Turkey City and Triangle are\r\nsufficiently obvious. Sistersville, the centre of activity in West\r\nVirginia, is blamed upon twin-islets in the river. Alemagooselum is a\r\nmedley as uncertain in its origin as the ingredients of boarding-house\r\nhash. Diagrams are needed to convey a reasonable notion of “clamps,”\r\n“seed-bags,” “jars,” “reamers,” “sockets,” “centre-bits,” “mud-veins,”\r\n“tea-heads,” “conductors,” “Samson-posts,” “bull-wheels,” “band-wheels,”\r\n“walking-beams,” “grasshoppers,” “sucker-rods,” “temper-screws,”\r\n“pole-tools,” “casing,” “tubing,” “working-barrels,” “standing-valves,”\r\n“check-valves,” “force-pumps,” “loading-racks,” “well-shooters,”\r\n“royalty,” “puts,” “calls,” “margins,” “carrying-rates,” “spot,”\r\n“regular,” “pipage,” “storage,” and the thousand-and-one things that\r\nmake up the past and present of the lingo of petroleum.\r\n\r\nThe Literary Guild is not the smallest frog in the petroleum-pool.\r\n\r\n                          THE WOMAN’S EDITION.\r\n\r\nTo raise twenty-five-hundred dollars for an annex to the hospital, the\r\nladies of Oil City, on February twelfth, 1896, issued the “Woman’s\r\nEdition” of the _Derrick_. It was a splendid literary and financial\r\nsuccess, realizing nearly five-thousand dollars. This apt poem graced\r\nthe editorial page:\r\n\r\n         Oh! sad was her brow and wild was her mien,\r\n         Her expression the blankest that ever was seen;\r\n         She was pained, she was hurt at the plain requisition:\r\n         “We expect you to write for the Woman’s Edition.”\r\n\r\n         Her babies wept sadly, her husband looked blue,\r\n         Her house was disordered, each room in a stew;\r\n         Do you ask me to tell why this sad exhibition?\r\n         She was trying to write for the Woman’s Edition.\r\n\r\n         Oh, what should she write? she had nothing to say;\r\n         She pondered and thought all the long weary day;\r\n         The question of woman, her life and her mission,\r\n         Must all be touched up in the Woman’s Edition.\r\n\r\n         But what could she do—oh, how could she write?\r\n         She could bake, she could brew from morning to night;\r\n         She had even been known to get up a petition:\r\n         But now she must write for “The Woman’s Edition.”\r\n\r\n         She felt that she must; her sisters all did it,\r\n         Would she fall behind? The saints all forbid it!\r\n         If the rest of her life should be spent in contrition,\r\n         She felt she must write for the Woman’s Edition.\r\n\r\n         She did it, she wrote it, now read it and ponder;\r\n         She treated a subject a little beyond her,\r\n         But that was much better than total omission\r\n         Of her name from the list on the Woman’s Edition.\r\n\r\n         Now her home is restored, her husband has smiled,\r\n         But, alas! that pleased look on his face was beguiled\r\n         By her cheerful assent to his simple condition:\r\n         That she’ll not write again for a Woman’s Edition.\r\n\r\n                        THE GIRL AND THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\nD. A. Denison, the lively editor of the Bradford _Era_, is rarely\r\nvanquished in any sort of encounter. A “sweet-girl graduate” wrote a\r\nstory and wanted him to print it. Thinking to let her down gently, he\r\nremarked: “Your romance suits me splendidly, but it has trivial faults.\r\nFor instance, you describe the heroine’s canary as drinking water by\r\n‘lapping it up eagerly with her tongue.’ Isn’t that a peculiar way for a\r\ncanary to drink water?” “Your criticism surprises me,” said the blushing\r\ngirl in a pained voice. “Still, if you think your readers would prefer\r\nit, perhaps it would be better to let the canary drink water with a\r\nteaspoon.” Dennison wilted like an ice-cream in July, promised to\r\npublish the story and the girl walked away mistress of the situation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WELL FLOWING OIL AFTER TORPEDOING.\r\n  E.

Glycerine is a harmless\r\nsubstance and its very name signifies sweetness. Combining it with the\r\ntwo acids changed the three ingredients materially. The action of the\r\nacids caused the glycerine to lose hydrogen and take up nitrogen and\r\noxygen. The product, which the discoverer baptized Nitro-Glycerine,\r\nappeared meek and innocent as Mary’s little lamb and was readily\r\nmistaken for lard-oil. It burned in lamps, consuming quietly and\r\nemitting a gentle light. But concussion proved the oily-looking liquid\r\nto be a terrible explosive, more powerful than gun-cotton, gunpowder or\r\ndynamite. For twenty years it was not applied to any useful purpose in\r\nthe arts. Strangely enough, it was first put up as a homœopathic\r\nremedy for headache, because a few drops rubbed on any portion of the\r\nbody pained the head acutely. James G. Blaine was given doses of it on\r\nhis death-bed. An energetic poison, fatalities resulted from imbibing it\r\nfor whisky, which it resembles in taste. After a time attention was\r\ndirected unexpectedly to its explosive qualities. A small consignment,\r\nsent to this country as a specimen, accidentally exploded in a New-York\r\nstreet. This set the newspapers and the public talking about it and\r\nwondering what caused the stuff to go off. Investigation solved the\r\nmystery and revealed the latent power of the compound, which had\r\npreviously figured only as a rare chemical in a half-score foreign\r\nlaboratories. Miners and contractors gradually learned its value for\r\nblasting masses of rock. Five pounds, placed in a stone-jar and\r\nsuspended against the iron-side of the steamer Scotland, sunk off Sandy\r\nHook, cut a fissure twelve feet long in the vessel. A steamship at\r\nAspinwall was torn to atoms and people stood in mortal terror of the\r\ndestructive agent. Girls threw away the glycerine prescribed for chapped\r\nlips, lest it should burst up and distribute them piecemeal over the\r\nnext county. Their cotton-padding or charcoal-dentifrice was as\r\ndangerous as the glycerine alone, which is an excellent application for\r\nthe skin. A flame or a spark would not explode Nitro-Glycerine readily,\r\nbut the chap who struck it a hard rap might as well avoid trouble among\r\nhis heirs by having had his will written and a cigar-box ordered to hold\r\nsuch fragments as his weeping relatives could pick from the surrounding\r\ndistrict. Such was the introduction to mankind of a compound that was to\r\nfill a niche in connection with the production of petroleum.\r\n\r\nParaffine is the unrelenting foe of oil-wells. It clogged and choked\r\nsome of the largest wells on Oil Creek and diminished the yield of\r\nothers in every quarter of the field. It incrusts the veins of the rock\r\nand the pipes, just as lime in the water coats the tubes of a\r\nsteam-boiler or the inside of a tea-kettle. How to overcome its ill\r\neffects was a question as serious as the extermination of the potato-bug\r\nor the army-worm. Operators steamed their wells, often with good\r\nresults, the hot vapor melting the paraffine, and drenched them with\r\nbenzine to accomplish the same object. A genius patented a liquid that\r\nwould boil and fizz and discourage all the paraffine it touched,\r\ncleaning the tubing and the seams in the sand much as caustic-soda\r\nscours the waste-pipe of a sink or closet. These methods were very\r\nlimited in their scope, the steam condensing, the benzine mixing with\r\nthe oil and the burning fluid cooling off before penetrating the\r\ncrevices in the strata any considerable distance. Exploding powder in\r\nholes drilled at the bottom of water-wells had increased the quantity of\r\nfluid or opened new veins and the idea of trying the experiment in\r\noil-wells suggested itself to various operators. In 1860 Henry H.\r\nDennis, who drilled and stuck the tools in the first well at Tidioute,\r\nprocured three feet of two-inch copper-pipe, plugged one end, filled it\r\nwith rifle-powder, inserted a fuse-cord and exploded the charge in\r\npresence of six men. The hole was full of water, oil and bits of rock\r\nwere blown into the air and “the smell of oil was so much stronger that\r\npeople coming up the hollow noticed it.” The same year John F. Harper\r\nendeavored to explode five pounds of powder in A. W. Raymond’s well, at\r\nFranklin. The tin-case holding the powder collapsed under the pressure\r\nof the water and the fuse had gone out. William Reed assisted Raymond\r\nand W. Ayers Brashear, who had expected James Barry—he put up the first\r\ntelegraph-line between Pittsburg and Franklin—to fire the charge by\r\nelectricity. Reed developed the idea and invented the “Reed Torpedo,”\r\nwhich he used in a number of wells. A large crowd in 1866 witnessed the\r\ntorpedoing of John C. Ford’s well, on the Widow Fleming farm, four miles\r\nsouth of Titusville. Five pounds of powder in an earthen bottle,\r\nattached to a string of gas-pipe, were exploded at two-hundred-and-fifty\r\nfeet by dropping a red-hot iron through the pipe. The shock threw the\r\nwater out of the hole, threw out the pipe with such force as to knock\r\ndown the walking-beam and samson-post, agitated the water in Oil Creek\r\nand “sent out oil.” Tubing was put in, the old horse worked the pump\r\nuntil tired out and the result encouraged Ford to buy machinery to keep\r\nthe well going constantly. This was _the first successful torpedoing of\r\nan oil-well_! The Watson well, near by, was similarly treated by Harper,\r\nwho had brought four bottles of the powder from Franklin and was\r\ndevoting his time to “blasting wells.” For his services at the Ford well\r\nhe received twenty dollars. Harper, William Skinner and a man named\r\nPotter formed a partnership for this purpose. They torpedoed the Adams\r\nwell, on the Stackpole farm, below the Fleming, putting the powder in a\r\nglass-bottle. The territory was dry and no oil followed the explosion.\r\nIn the fall of 1860 they shot Gideon B. Walker’s well at Tidioute. Five\r\ntorpedoes were exploded in 1860 at Franklin, Tidioute and on Oil Creek.\r\nBusiness was disturbed over the grave political outlook, oil was\r\nbecoming too plentiful, the price was merely nominal and the\r\ntorpedo-industry languished.\r\n\r\nWilliam F. Kingsbury advertised in 1860 that he would “put blasts in\r\noil-wells to increase their production.” He torpedoed a well in 1861 on\r\nthe island at Tidioute, using a can of powder and a fuse, which ignited\r\nperfectly. Mark Wilson and L. G. Merrill lectured on electricity in\r\n1860-61, traveling over the country and exhibiting the principle of\r\n“Colt’s Submarine Battery,” by which “the rock at any distance beneath\r\nthe surface of the earth may be rent asunder, thereby enabling the oil\r\nto flow to the well.” Frederick Crocker in 1864 arranged a torpedo to be\r\ndropped into a well and fired by a pistol-cartridge inserted in the\r\nbottom of the tin-shell. About thirty torpedoes were exploded from 1860\r\nto 1865, all of them in wells filled with water, which served as\r\ntamping. Erastus Jones, James K. Jones and David Card exploded them in\r\nwells at Liverpool, Ohio. Joseph Chandler handled two or three at\r\nPioneer and George Koch fired one of his own construction in May of\r\n1864. Mr. Beardslee—he struck a vein of water by drilling a hole five\r\nfeet and exploding a case of powder at the bottom of a well in 1844,\r\nnear Rochester, N. Y.—came to the oil-region and put in a score of shots\r\nin 1865. As long ago as 1808 the yield of water in a well at Fort Regent\r\nwas doubled by drilling a small hole and firing a quantity of powder. A\r\nflowing-well on the lease beside the Crocker stopped when the latter was\r\ntorpedoed and was rigged for pumping. It pumped “black powder-water,”\r\nshowing that the torpedo had opened an underground connection between\r\nthe two wells, the effects of the explosion reaching from the Crocker to\r\nits neighbor. William Reed made a can strong enough to resist the\r\npressure of the water, let it down the Criswell well on Cherry Run in\r\n1863, failed to discharge it by electricity and exploded it by sliding a\r\nhollow weight down a string to strike a percussion-cap.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these facts, which demonstrated that the yield of oil\r\nand water had been increased by exploding powder hundreds of feet under\r\nwater, in November of 1864 Col. E. A. L. Roberts applied for a patent\r\nfor “a process of increasing the productiveness of oil-wells by causing\r\nan explosion of gunpowder or its equivalent at or near the oil-bearing\r\npoint, in connection with superincumbent fluid-tamping.” He claimed that\r\nthe action of a shell at Fredericksburg in 1862, which exploded in a\r\nmill-race, suggested to him the idea of bombarding oil-wells. However\r\nthis may be—it has been said he was not at Fredericksburg at the date\r\nspecified in his papers—the Colonel furnished no drawings and presented\r\nno application for Letters Patent for over two years. He constructed six\r\nof his torpedoes and arrived with them at Titusville in January of 1865.\r\nCaptain Mills permitted him to test his process in the Ladies’ well,\r\nnear Titusville, on January twenty-first. Two torpedoes were exploded\r\nand the well flowed oil and paraffine. Reed, Harper and three or four\r\nothers filed applications for patents and commenced proceedings for\r\ninterference. The suits dragged two years, were decided in favor of\r\nRoberts and he secured the patent that was to become a grievous\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nA company was organized in New York to construct torpedoes and carry on\r\nthe business extensively. Operators were rather sceptical as to the\r\nadvantages of the Roberts method, fearing the missiles would shatter the\r\nrock and destroy the wells. The Woodin well, a dry-hole on the Blood\r\nfarm, received two injections and pumped eighty barrels a day in\r\nDecember of 1866. During 1867 the demand increased largely and many\r\nsuits for infringements were entered. Roberts seemed to have the courts\r\non his side and he obtained injunctions against the Reed Torpedo-Company\r\nand James Dickey for alleged infringements. Justices Strong and McKennan\r\ndecided against Dickey in 1871. Producers subscribed fifty-thousand\r\ndollars to break down the Roberts patent and confidently expected a\r\nfavorable issue. Judge Grier, of Philadelphia, mulcted the Reed Company\r\nin heavy damages. Nickerson and Hamar, ingenious, clever fellows, fared\r\nsimilarly. Roberts substituted Nitro-Glycerine for gunpowder and\r\nestablished a manufactory of the explosive near Titusville. The\r\ntorpedo-war became general, determined and uncompromising. The monopoly\r\ncharged exorbitant prices—two-hundred dollars for a medium shot—and an\r\narmy of “moonlighters”—nervy men who put in torpedoes at night—sprang\r\ninto existence. The “moonlighters” effected great improvements and first\r\nused the “go-devil drop-weight” in the Butler field in 1876. The Roberts\r\ncrowd hired a legion of spies to report operators who patronized the\r\nnocturnal well-shooters. The country swarmed with these emissaries. You\r\ncouldn’t spit in the street or near a well after dark without danger of\r\nhitting one of the crew. Unexampled litigation followed. About\r\n_two-thousand_ prosecutions were threatened and most of them begun\r\nagainst producers accused of violating the law by engaging\r\n“moonlighters.” The array of counsel was most imposing. It included\r\nBakewell & Christy, of Pittsburg, and George Harding, of Philadelphia,\r\nfor the torpedo-company. Kellar & Blake, of New York, and General\r\nBenjamin F. Butler were retained by a number of defendants. Most of the\r\nindividual suits were settled, the annoyance of trying them in\r\nPittsburg, fees of lawyers and enormous costs inducing the operators to\r\nmake such terms as they could. By this means the coffers of the company\r\nwere filled to overflowing and the Roberts Brothers rolled up millions\r\nof dollars.\r\n\r\nThe late H. Bucher Swope, the brilliant district-attorney of Pittsburg,\r\nwas especially active in behalf of Roberts. The bitter feeling\r\nengendered by convictions deemed unjust, awards of excessive damages and\r\nnumerous imprisonments found expression in pointed newspaper paragraphs.\r\nCol. Roberts preserved in scrap-books every item regarding his\r\nbusiness-methods, himself and his associates. One poetical squib,\r\nwritten by me and printed in the Oil-City _Times_, incensed him to the\r\nhighest pitch and was quoted by Mr. Swope in an argument before Judge\r\nMcKennan. The old Judge bristled with fury. Evidently he regretted that\r\nit was beyond his power to sentence somebody to the penitentiary for\r\ndaring hint that law was not always justice. He had not traveled quite\r\nso far on the tyrannical road as some later wearers of the ermine, who,\r\n“dressed in a little brief authority, play such fantastic tricks before\r\nhigh heaven as make the angels weep” and consign workingmen to limbo for\r\npresuming to present the demands of organized labor to employers! It is\r\nnot Eugene V. Debs or the mouthing anarchist, but the overbearing\r\ncorporation-tool on the bench, who is guilty of “contempt of court.”\r\n\r\nThe Roberts patent re-issued in June of 1873, perpetuating the\r\nburdensome load upon oil-producers. In November of 1876 suit was brought\r\nin the Circuit Court against Peter Schreiber, of Oil City, charged with\r\ninfringing the Roberts process. Schreiber’s torpedo duplicated the\r\nunpatented Crocker cartridge and Roberts wanted his scalp. The case was\r\ncontested keenly four years, coming up for final argument in May of\r\n1879. Henry Baldwin and James C. Boyce, of Oil City, and Hon. J. H.\r\nOsmer, of Franklin, were the defendant’s attorneys. Mr. Boyce collected\r\na mass of testimony that seemed overwhelming. He spent years working up\r\na masterly defense. By unimpeachable witnesses he proved that explosives\r\nhad been used in water-wells and oil-wells, substantially in the manner\r\npatented by Roberts, years before the holder of the patent had been\r\nheard of as a torpedoist. But his masterly efforts were wasted upon\r\nJustices Strong and McKennan. They had sustained the monopoly in the\r\nprevious suits and apparently would not reverse themselves, no matter\r\nhow convincing the reasons. Mr. Schreiber, wearied by the law’s\r\ninterminable delays and thirty-thousand dollars of expenditure, decided\r\nnot to suffer the further annoyance of appealing to the United-States\r\nSupreme Court. The great body of producers, disgusted with the courts\r\nand despairing of fair-play, did not care to provide the funds to carry\r\nthe case to the highest tribunal and lock it up for years awaiting a\r\nhearing. The flood of light thrown upon it by Boyce’s researches had the\r\neffect of preventing an extension of the patent and reducing the price\r\nof torpedoes, thus benefiting the oil-region greatly. Mr. Boyce is now\r\npracticing his profession in Pittsburg. He resided at Oil City for years\r\nand was noted for his bright wit, his incisive logic, his profound\r\ninterest in education and his social accomplishments.\r\n\r\nCol. Edward A. L. Roberts died at Titusville on Friday morning, March\r\ntwenty-fifth, 1881, after a short illness. His demise was quite\r\nunexpected, as he continued in ordinary health until Tuesday night. Then\r\nhe was seized with intermittent fever, which rapidly gained ground until\r\nit proved fatal. A moment before dissolution he asked Dr. Freeman, who\r\nwas with him, for a glass of water. Drinking it and staring intently at\r\nthe doctor, his eyes filled with tears and he said, “I am gone.”\r\nPressing back upon the pillow, he expired almost instantly. Col. Roberts\r\nwas born at Moreau, Saratoga county, New York, in 1829. At seventeen he\r\nenlisted as a private, served with commendable bravery in the Mexican\r\nwar and was honorably discharged after a service of two years. Returning\r\nto his native place, he entered an academy and passed several years\r\nacquiring a higher education. Subsequently he entered the dental office\r\nof his brother at Poughkeepsie, N. Y. Still later he removed to the city\r\nand with his brother, W. B. Roberts, engaged in the manufacture of\r\ndental material. For his improvements in dental science and articles he\r\nwas awarded several gold-medals by the American Institute. He patented\r\nvarious inventions that have been of great service and are now in\r\ngeneral use. In the oil-region he was best known as the owner of the\r\ntorpedo-patent bearing his name. He came to Titusville in January of\r\n1865 and the same month exploded two shells in the Ladies’ well,\r\nincreasing its yield largely. From that time to the present the use of\r\ntorpedoes has continued. The litigation over the patent and\r\ninfringements attracted widespread attention. The last week of his life\r\nCol. Roberts said he had expended a quarter-million dollars in\r\ntorpedo-litigation. He was responsible for more lawsuits than any other\r\nman in the United States. A man of many eccentricities and strong\r\nfeelings, he was always liberal and enterprising. He left a large\r\nfortune and one of the most profitable monopolies in the State. In 1869\r\nhe married Mrs. Chase, separated from her in 1877 and lived at the\r\nBrunswick Hotel. His widow and two children survived him. Col. Roberts\r\ndid much to build up Titusville and his funeral was the largest the town\r\nhas ever witnessed. He sleeps in the pretty cemetery and a peculiar\r\nmonument, emblematic of the torpedo, marks the burial-plot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HOTEL BRUNSWICK.\r\n  C. J. ANDREWS\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the palatial Hotel Brunswick, which he built and nurtured as the\r\napple of his eye, Col. Roberts lavished part of his wealth. He decorated\r\nand furnished it gorgeously from cellar to roof. The appointments were\r\nluxurious throughout. If the landlords he engaged could not meet\r\nexpenses, the Colonel paid the deficiency ungrudgingly and sawed wood.\r\nFinally the house was conducted in business-style and paid handsomely.\r\nFor years it has been run by Charles J. Andrews, who was born with a\r\ntalent for hotel-keeping. “Charlie” is well-known in every nook and\r\ncorner of Pennsylvania as a “jolly good fellow,” keen politician and\r\nall-round thoroughbred. He has the rare faculty of winning friends and\r\nof engineering bills through the Legislature. He is head of the Liquor\r\nLeague, a tireless worker, a masterly joker and brimming over with\r\npat-stories that do not strike back. He operates in oil and base-ball as\r\na diversion, is a familiar figure in Philadelphia and Harrisburg and\r\npopular everywhere.\r\n\r\nDr. Walter B. Roberts, partner of his brother in the torpedo-company,\r\nclerked in an Albany bank, taught district-school, studied medicine and\r\nrose to eminence in dentistry. Visiting Nicaragua in 1853, he\r\nestablished a firm to ship deer-skins and cattle-hides to the United\r\nStates and built up a large trade with Central America. Resuming his\r\npractice, he and E. A. L. Roberts opened dental-rooms in New York. His\r\nbrother enlisted and upon returning from the war assigned the Doctor a\r\nhalf-interest in a torpedo for oil-wells he desired to patent. In 1865\r\nDr. Roberts organized the Roberts Torpedo-Company, was chosen its\r\nsecretary in 1866 and its president in 1867. He visited Europe in 1867\r\nand removed to Titusville in 1868, residing there until his death. In\r\n1872 he was elected mayor, but his intense longing for a seat in\r\nCongress was never gratified. The oil-producers, whom the vexatious\r\ntorpedo-suits made hot under the collar, opposed him resolutely. He had\r\nsucceeded in his profession and his business and his crowning ambition\r\nwas to go to Washington. The arrow of political disappointment pricked\r\nhis temper at times, although to the last he supported the Republican\r\nparty zealously. Dr. Roberts was a man of marked characteristics, tall,\r\nstoutly built and vigorous mentally. He did much to advance the\r\ninterests of his adopted city and was respected for his courage, his\r\nearnestness and his benevolence to the poor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM H. ANDREWS.]\r\n\r\nHon. William H. Andrews managed the campaign of Dr. Roberts, who fancied\r\nthe adroitness, pluck and push of the coming leader and used his\r\ninfluence to elect him chairman of the Crawford-County Republican\r\nCommittee. He performed the duties so capably that he served four terms,\r\nwas secretary of the State Committee in 1887-8 and its chairman in\r\n1890-1. Mr. Andrews was born in Warren county and at an early age\r\nentered upon a mercantile career. He established large dry-goods stores\r\nat Titusville, Franklin and Meadville, introduced modern ideas and did a\r\ntremendous business. He advertised by the page, ran excursion-trains at\r\nsuitable periods and sold his wares at prices to attract multitudes of\r\ncustomers. Nobody ever heard of dull trade or hard times at any of the\r\nAndrews stores. Removing to Cincinnati, he opened the biggest store in\r\nthe city and forced local merchants to crawl out of the old rut and\r\nhustle. But the aroma of petroleum, the motion of the walking-beam, the\r\ndash and spirit of oil-region life were lacking in Porkopolis and\r\nAndrews returned to Titusville. He engaged in politics with the ardor he\r\nhad displayed in trade. His skill as an organizer saved the\r\nCongressional district from the Greenbackers and won him the\r\nchairmanship of the Republican State-Committee. He served two terms in\r\nthe Legislature and was elected to the Senate in 1894. He is chairman of\r\nthe senatorial committee appointed last session to “Lexow” Philadelphia\r\nand Pittsburg. His brother, W. R. Andrews, edited the Meadville\r\n_Tribune_ and was secretary of the State Committee. Another, Charles J.\r\nAndrews, was proprietor of the Hotel Brunswick and an active politician.\r\nSenator Andrews rarely wastes his breath on long-winded speeches, wisely\r\npreferring to do effective work in committee. No member of the House or\r\nSenate is more influential, more ready to oblige his friends, more\r\nsought for favors and surer of carrying through a bill. He enjoys the\r\nconfidence of Senator Quay and his next promotion may be to the\r\nUnited-States Senate as successor of Matthew S. himself. Mr. Andrews\r\nlives at Allegheny, has oil-wells on Church Run and a big farm in the\r\nsuburbs of Titusville, is prominent in local industries and a\r\nrepresentative citizen.\r\n\r\nGradually the quantity of explosive in a torpedo was increased, in order\r\nto shatter a wider area of oil-bearing rock. A hundred quarts of\r\nNitro-Glycerine have been used for a single shot. In such instances it\r\nis lowered into the well in cans, one resting upon another at the bottom\r\nof the hole until the desired amount is in place. A cap is adjusted to\r\nthe top of the last can, the cord that lowered the Nitro-Glycerine is\r\npulled up, a weight is dropped upon the cap and an explosion equal to\r\nthe force of a ton of gunpowder ensues. In a few seconds a shower of\r\nwater, oil, mud and pebbles ascends, saturating the derrick and pelting\r\nbroken stones in every direction. Frank H. Taylor graphically describes\r\na scene at Thorn Creek:\r\n\r\n“On October twenty-seventh, 1884, those who stood at the brick\r\nschool-house and telegraph-offices in the Thorn Creek district and saw\r\nthe Semple, Boyd & Armstrong No. 2 torpedoed, gazed upon the grandest\r\nscene ever witnessed in Oildom. When the shot took effect and the barren\r\nrock, as if smitten by the rod of Moses, poured forth its torrent of\r\noil, it was such a magnificent and awful spectacle that no painter’s\r\nbrush or poet’s pen could do it justice. Men familiar with the wonderful\r\nsights of the oil-country were struck dumb with astonishment, as they\r\nbeheld the mighty display of Nature’s forces. There was no sudden\r\nreaction after the torpedo was exploded. A column of water rose eight or\r\nten feet and fell back again, some time elapsed before the force of the\r\nexplosion emptied the hole and the burnt glycerine, mud and sand rushed\r\nup in the derrick in a black stream. The blackness gradually changed to\r\nyellow; then, with a mighty roar, the gas burst forth with a deafening\r\nnoise, like the thunderbolt set free. For a moment the cloud of gas hid\r\nthe derrick from sight and then, as this cleared away, a solid golden\r\ncolumn half-a-foot in diameter shot from the derrick-floor eighty feet\r\nthrough the air, till it broke in fragments on the crown-pulley and fell\r\nin a shower of yellow rain for rods around. For over an hour that grand\r\ncolumn of oil, rushing swifter than any torrent and straight as a\r\nmountain pine, united derrick-floor and top. In a few moments the ground\r\naround the derrick was covered inches deep with petroleum. The branches\r\nof the oak-trees were like huge yellow plumes and a stream as large as a\r\nman’s body ran down the hill to the road. It filled the space beneath\r\nthe small bridge and, continuing down the hill through the woods beyond,\r\nspread out upon the flats where the Johnson well is. In two hours these\r\nflats were covered with a flood of oil. The hill-side was as if a yellow\r\nfreshet had passed over it. Heavy clouds of gas, almost obscuring the\r\nderrick, hung low in the woods, and still that mighty rush continued.\r\nSome of those who witnessed it estimated the well to be flowing\r\nfive-hundred barrels per hour. Dams were built across the stream, that\r\nits production might be estimated; the dams overflowed and were swept\r\naway before they could be completed. People living along Thorn Creek\r\npacked up their household-goods and fled to the hill-sides. The\r\npump-station, a mile-and-a-half down the creek, had to extinguish its\r\nfires that night on account of gas. All fires around the district were\r\nput out. It was literally a flood of oil. It was estimated that the\r\nproduction was ten-thousand barrels the first twenty-four hours. The\r\nforeman, endeavoring to get the tools into the well, was overcome by the\r\ngas and fell under the bull-wheels. He was rescued immediately and\r\nmedical aid summoned. He remained unconscious two hours, but\r\nsubsequently recovered fully. Several men volunteered to undertake the\r\njob of shutting in the largest well ever struck in the oil-region. The\r\npacker for the oil-saver was tied on the bull-wheel shaft, the tools\r\nwere placed over the hole and run in. But the pressure of the solid\r\nstream of oil against it prevented its going lower, even with the\r\nsuspended weight of the two-thousand-pound tools. One-thousand pounds\r\nadditional weight were added before the cap was fitted and the well\r\nclosed. A casing-connection and tubing-lines connected the well with a\r\ntank.”\r\n\r\nHad the owners not torpedoed this well, which they believed to be dry,\r\nits value would never have been known. Its conceded failure would have\r\nchilled ambitious operators who held adjoining leases and changed the\r\nentire history of Thorn Creek.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM MUNSON.]\r\n\r\nTorpedoing wells is a hazardous business. A professional well-shooter\r\nmust have nerves of iron, be temperate in his habits and keenly alive to\r\nthe fact that a careless movement or a misstep may send him flying into\r\nspace. James Sanders, a veteran employé of the Roberts Company, fired\r\nsix-thousand torpedoes without the slightest accident and lived for\r\nyears after his well-earned retirement. Nitro-Glycerine literally tears\r\nits victims into shreds. It is quick as lightning and can’t be dodged.\r\nThe first fatality from its use in the oil-regions befell William\r\nMunson, in the summer of 1867, at Reno. He operated on Cherry Run,\r\nowning wells near the famous Reed and Wade. He was one of the earliest\r\nproducers to use torpedoes and manufactured them under the Reed patent.\r\nA small building at the bend of the Allegheny below Reno served as his\r\nworkshop and storehouse. For months the new industry went along quietly,\r\nits projector prospering as the result of his enterprise. Entering the\r\nbuilding one morning in August, he was seen no more. How it occurred\r\nnone could tell, but a frightful explosion shivered the building, tore a\r\nhole in the ground and annihilated Munson. Houses trembled to their\r\nfoundations, dishes were thrown from the shelves, windows were shattered\r\nand about Oil City the horrible shock drove people frantically into the\r\nstreets. Not a trace of Munson’s premises remained, while fragments of\r\nflesh and bone strewn over acres of ground too plainly revealed the\r\ndreadful fate of the proprietor. The mangled bits were carefully\r\ngathered up, put in a small box and sent to his former home in New York\r\nfor interment. The tragedy aroused profound sympathy. Mentally, morally\r\nand physically William Munson was a fine specimen of manhood, thoroughly\r\nupright and trustworthy. He lived at Franklin and belonged to the\r\nMethodist church. His widow and two daughters survived the fond husband\r\nand father. Mrs. Munson first moved to California, then returned\r\neastward and she is now practicing medicine at Toledo, the home of her\r\ndaughters, the younger of whom married Frank Gleason.\r\n\r\nThe sensation produced by the first fatality had not entirely subsided\r\nwhen the second victim was added to a list that has since lengthened\r\nappallingly. To ensure comparative safety the deadly stuff was kept in\r\nmagazines located in isolated places. In 1867 the Roberts Company built\r\none of these receptacles two miles from Titusville, in the side of a\r\nhill excavated for the purpose. Thither Patrick Brophy, who had charge,\r\nwent as usual one fine morning in July of 1868. An hour later a terrific\r\nexplosion burst upon the surrounding country with indescribable\r\nviolence. Horses and people on the streets of Titusville were thrown\r\ndown, chimneys tumbled, windows dropped into atoms and for a time the\r\npanic was fearful. Then the thought suggested itself that the\r\nglycerine-magazine had blown up. At once thousands started for the spot.\r\nThe site had been converted into a huge chasm, with tons of dirt\r\nscattered far and wide. Branches of trees were lopped off as though cut\r\nby a knife and hardly a particle could be found of what had so recently\r\nbeen a sentient being, instinct with life and feeling and fondly\r\nanticipating a happy career. The unfortunate youth bore an excellent\r\ncharacter for sobriety and carefulness. He was a young Irishman, had\r\nbeen a brakeman on the Farmers’ Railroad and visited the magazine\r\nfrequently to make experiments.\r\n\r\nOn Church Run, two miles back of Titusville, Colonel Davison established\r\na torpedo-manufactory in 1868. A few months passed safely and then the\r\ntragedy came. With three workmen—Henry Todd, A. D. Griffin and William\r\nBills—Colonel Davison went to the factory, as was his practice, one\r\nmorning in September. A torpedo must have burst in course of filling,\r\ncausing sad destruction. The building was knocked into splinters,\r\nburying the occupants beneath the ruins. All around the customary\r\nevidences of havoc were presented, although the sheltered position of\r\nthe factory prevented much damage to Titusville. The mangled bodies of\r\nhis companions were extricated from the wreck. while Colonel Davison\r\nstill breathed. He did not regain consciousness and death closed the\r\nchapter during the afternoon. This dismal event produced a deep\r\nimpression, the extinction of four lives investing it with peculiar\r\ninterest to the people of Oildom, many of whom knew the victims and\r\nsincerely lamented their mournful exit.\r\n\r\nDr. Fowler, the seventh victim, met his doom at Franklin in 1869. He had\r\nerected a magazine on the hill above the Allegheny Valley depot, in\r\nwhich large quantities of explosives were stored. With his brother\r\nCharles the Doctor started for the storehouse one forenoon. At the\r\nriver-bridge a friend detained Charles for a few moments in\r\nconversation, the Doctor proceeding alone. What happened prior to the\r\nshock will not be revealed until all secrets are laid bare, but before\r\nCharles reached the magazine a tremendous explosion launched his brother\r\ninto eternity. A spectator first noticed the boards of the building\r\nflying through space, followed in a moment by a report that made the\r\nearth quiver. The nearest properties were wrecked and the jar was felt\r\nmiles away. Careful search for the remains of the poor Doctor resulted\r\nin a small lot of broken bones and pieces of flesh, which were buried in\r\nthe Franklin cemetery. It was supposed that the catastrophe originated\r\nfrom the Doctor’s boots coming in contact with some glycerine that may\r\nhave leaked upon the floor. This is as plausible a reason as can be\r\nassigned for a tragedy that brought grief to many loving hearts. The\r\nDoctor was a genial, kindly gentleman and his cruel fate was universally\r\ndeplored.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM A. THOMPSON.]\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Thompson, of Franklin, left home on Tuesday morning, August\r\nthirteenth, 1870, carrying in his buggy a torpedo to be exploded in a\r\nwell on the Foster farm. John Quinn rode with him. At the farm he\r\nreceived two old torpedoes, which had been there five or six weeks,\r\nhaving failed to explode, to return to the factory. Quinn came up the\r\nriver by rail. Thompson stopped at Samuel Graham’s, Bully Hill, got an\r\napple and lighted a cigar. On leaving he said: “Good-bye, Sam, perhaps\r\nyou’ll never see me again!” Five minutes later an explosion was heard on\r\nthe Bully-Hill road, a mile from where Dr. Fowler had met his doom.\r\nGraham and others hurried to the spot. The body of Thompson, horribly\r\nmutilated, was lying fifty feet from the road, the left arm severed\r\nabove the elbow and missing. The horse and the fore-wheels of the buggy\r\nwere found a hundred yards off, the wounded animal struggling that\r\ndistance before he fell. The body and hind-wheels of the vehicle were in\r\nsplinters. One tire hung on a tree and a boot on another. The main\r\ncharge of the torpedo had entered the victim’s left side above the hip\r\nand the face was scarcely disfigured. Mr. Thompson was widely known and\r\nesteemed for his social qualities and high character. He was born in\r\nClearfield county, came to Franklin in 1853, married in 1855 and met his\r\nshocking fate at the age of thirty-nine. His widow and a daughter live\r\nat Franklin.\r\n\r\nThus far the losses of human life were occasioned by the explosion of\r\ngreat quantities of the messengers of death. The next instance\r\ndemonstrated the amazing strength of Nitro-Glycerine in small parcels, a\r\nfew drops ending the existence of a vigorous man at Scrubgrass, Venango\r\ncounty, in the summer of 1870. R. W. Redfield, agent of a\r\ntorpedo-company, hid a can of glycerine in the bushes, expecting to\r\nreturn and use it the following day. While picking berries Mrs. George\r\nFetterman saw the can and handed it to her husband. Thinking it was\r\nlard-oil, which Nitro-Glycerine in its fluid state resembles closely,\r\nFetterman poured some into a vessel and sent it to his wells. It was\r\nused as a lubricant for several days. Noticing a heated journal one\r\nmorning, Fetterman put a little of the supposed oil on the axle, with\r\nthe engine in rapid motion. A furious explosion ensued, tearing the\r\nengine-house into splinters and partially stunning three men at work in\r\nthe derrick. Poor Fetterman was found shockingly mangled, with one arm\r\ntorn off and his head crushed into jelly. The mystery was not solved for\r\nhours, when it occurred to a neighbor to test the contents of the\r\noil-can. Putting _one drop_ on an anvil, he struck it a heavy blow and\r\nwas hurled to the earth by the force of the concussion. The can was a\r\ncommon oiler, holding a half-pint, and probably not a dozen drops had\r\ntouched the journal before the explosion took place. Fetterman was a man\r\nof remarkable physical power, weighing two-hundred-and-thirty pounds and\r\nlooking the picture of health and vigor. Yet a quarter-spoonful of\r\nnitro-glycerine sufficed to usher him into the hereafter under\r\ncircumstances particularly distressing.\r\n\r\nIn the fall a young man lost his life almost as singularly as Fetterman.\r\nHe attended a well at Shamburg, seven miles south of Titusville. The\r\nwell was torpedoed on a cold day. To thaw the glycerine a tub was filled\r\nwith hot water, into which the cans were put. When sufficiently thawed\r\nthey were taken out, the glycerine was poured into the shell and the\r\ntorpedoing was done satisfactorily. The tubing was replaced in the well\r\nand the young pumper went to turn on the steam to start the engine,\r\ncarrying a pair of tongs with him. He threw the tongs into the tub of\r\nwater. In an instant the engine-house was demolished by a fierce\r\nexplosion. The luckless youth was killed and his body mangled. A small\r\namount of glycerine must have leaked from the cans while they were\r\nthawing, as the result of which a soul was hurried into the presence of\r\nits Maker with alarming suddenness.\r\n\r\nIn August of 1871 Charles Clarke started towards Enterprise, a small\r\nvillage in Warren county, ten miles east of Titusville, with a lot of\r\nglycerine in a vehicle drawn by one horse. The trip was destined never\r\nto be accomplished. By the side of a high hill a piece of very rough\r\nroad had to be traveled. There the charge exploded. Likely some of the\r\nliquid had leaked over the buggy and springs and been too much jolted.\r\nThe concussion was awful. Pieces of the woodwork and tires were carried\r\nhundreds of yards. Half of one wheel lodged near the top of a large tree\r\nand for many rods the forest was stripped of its foliage and branches.\r\nPart of the face, with the mustache and four teeth adhering, was the\r\nlargest portion of the driver recovered from the debris. The horse was\r\ndisemboweled and to numerous trees lots of flesh and clothing were\r\nsticking. From the ghastly spectacle the beholders turned away\r\nshuddering. The handful of remains was buried reverently at Titusville,\r\ncrowds of people uniting in the last tribute of respect to “Charlie,”\r\nwhose youth and intelligence had made him a general favorite.\r\n\r\nA case similar to Thompson’s followed a few weeks after, near\r\nRouseville. Descending a steep hill on his way from torpedoing a well on\r\nthe Shaw farm, William Pine was sent out of the world unwarned. He had a\r\ntorpedo-shell and some cans of glycerine in a light wagon drawn by two\r\nhorses. No doubt, the extreme roughness of the road exploded the\r\ndangerous freight. The body of the driver was distributed in minute\r\nfragments over two acres and the buggy was destroyed, but the horses\r\nescaped with slight injury, probably because the force of the shock\r\npassed above them as they were going down the hill. Pine had a\r\npremonition of impending disaster. When leaving home he kissed his wife\r\naffectionately and told her he intended, should he return safely, to\r\nquit the torpedo-business forever next day. He was an industrious,\r\ncompetent young man, deserving of a better fate.\r\n\r\nIn October of the same year Charles Palmer was blown to pieces at the\r\nRoberts magazine, near Titusville, where Brophy died two years before.\r\nWith Captain West, agent of the company, he was removing cans of\r\nglycerine from a wagon to the magazine. He handled the cans so\r\nrecklessly that West warned him to be more careful. He made thirteen\r\ntrips from the wagon and entered the magazine for the fourteenth time.\r\nNext instant the magazine disappeared in a cloud of dust and smoke,\r\nleaving hardly a trace of man or material. West happened to be beside\r\nthe wagon and escaped unhurt. The horses galloped furiously through\r\nTitusville, the cans not taken out bounding around in the wagon. Why\r\nthey did not explode is a mystery. Had they done so the city would have\r\nbeen leveled and thousands of lives lost. Palmer paid dearly for his\r\ncarelessness, which was characteristic of the rollicking, light-hearted\r\nfellow whose existence terminated so shockingly.\r\n\r\nThis thrilling adventure decided Captain West, who lived at Oil City, to\r\nengage in pursuits more congenial to himself and agreeable to his\r\ndevoted family. He was finely educated, past the meridian and streaks of\r\ngray tinged his dark hair and beard. In November he torpedoed a well for\r\nme on Cherry Run. The shell stuck, together we drew it up, the Captain\r\nadjusted the cap and it was then lowered and exploded successfully. At\r\nparting he shook my hand warmly and remarked: “This is the last torpedo\r\nI shall put in for you. My engagement with the company will end next\r\nweek. Good-bye. Come and see me in Oil City.” Three days later he went\r\nto shoot a well at Reno, saying to his wife at starting: “This will wind\r\nup my work for the company.” Such proved to be the fact, although in a\r\nmanner very different from what the speaker imagined. The shell was\r\nlowered into the well, but failed to explode and the Captain concluded\r\nto draw it up and examine the priming. Near the surface it exploded,\r\ninstantly killing West, who was guiding the line attached to the\r\ntorpedo. He was hurled into the air, striking the walking-beam and\r\nfalling upon the derrick-floor a bruised and bleeding corpse. He had,\r\nindeed, put in his last torpedo. The main force of the explosion was\r\nspent in the well, otherwise the body and the derrick would have been\r\nblown to atoms. A tear from an old friend, as he recounts the tragic\r\nclose of an honorable career, is due the memory of a man whose sterling\r\nqualities were universally admired.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1873 two young lives paid the penalty at Scrubgrass. On a\r\nbright February morning “Doc” Wright, the torpedo-agent, stopped at the\r\nstation to send a despatch. The message sent, he invited the\r\ntelegraph-operator, George Wolfe, to ride with him to the magazine, a\r\nmile up the river. The two set out in high spirits, two dogs following\r\nthe sleigh. Hardly ten minutes elapsed when a dreadful report terrified\r\nthe settlement. From the magazine on the river-bank a light smoke\r\nascended. Two rods away stood the trembling horse, one eye torn from its\r\nsocket and his side lacerated. Beside him one dog lay lifeless.\r\nFragments of the cutter and the harness were strewn around\r\npromiscuously. Through the bushes a clean lane was cut and a large\r\nchestnut-tree uprooted. A deep gap alone remained of the magazine and\r\nscarcely a particle of the two men could be found. Dozens of splintered\r\ntrees across the Allegheny indicated alike the force and general\r\ndirection of the concussion. A boot containing part of a human foot was\r\npicked up fifty rods from the spot. Wright’s gold-watch, flattened and\r\ntwisted, was fished out of the Allegheny, two-hundred yards down the\r\nstream, in May. The remains, which two cigar-boxes would have held, were\r\ninterred close by. A marble shaft marks the grave, which Col. William\r\nPhillips, then president of the Allegheny-Valley Railroad, enclosed with\r\na neat iron-railing. It is very near the railway-track and the bank of\r\nthe river, a short distance above Kennerdell Station. The disaster was\r\nsupposed to have resulted from Wright’s using a hatchet to loosen a can\r\nof glycerine from the ice that held it fast. A pet spaniel, which had a\r\nhabit of rubbing against his legs and trying to jump into his arms,\r\naccompanied him from his boarding-house. The animal may have diverted\r\nhis attention momentarily, causing him to miss the ice and strike the\r\ncan. The horse lived for years, not much the worse except for the loss\r\nof one eye. Wright and Wolfe were lively and jocular and their sad fate\r\nwas deeply regretted. Many a telegram George Wolfe sent for me when\r\nScrubgrass was at full tide.\r\n\r\nOne morning in April of 1873 Dennis Run, a half-mile from Tidioute,\r\nexperienced a fierce explosion, which vibrated buildings, upset dishes\r\nand broke windows long distances off. It occurred at a frame structure\r\non the side of a hill, occupied by Andrew Dalrymple as a dwelling and\r\nengine-house. He was a “moonlighter,” putting in torpedoes at night to\r\navoid detection by the Roberts spotters, and was probably filling a\r\nshell at the moment of the explosion. It knocked the tenement into\r\ntoothpicks and killed Dalrymple, jamming his head and the upper portion\r\nof the trunk against an adjacent engine-house, the roof of which was\r\nsmeared with blood and particles of flesh. One arm lay in the small\r\ncreek four-hundred feet away, but not a vestige of the lower half of the\r\nbody could be discovered. A feeble cry from the ruins of the building\r\nsurprised the first persons to reach the place. Two feet beneath the\r\nrubbish a child twenty months old was found unhurt. Farther search\r\nrevealed Mrs. Dalrymple, badly mangled and unconscious. She lingered two\r\nhours. The little orphan, too young to understand the calamity that\r\ndeprived her of both parents, was adopted by a wealthy resident of\r\nTidioute and grew to be a beautiful girl. Thousands viewed the sad\r\nspectacle and followed the double funeral to the cemetery. It has been\r\nmy fortune to witness many sights of this description, but none\r\ncomprised more distressing elements than the sudden summons of the\r\ndoomed husband and wife. Mrs. Dalrymple was the only woman in the\r\noil-region whom Nitro-Glycerine slaughtered.\r\n\r\nIs there a sixth sense, an indefinable impression that prompts an action\r\nwithout an apparent reason? At Petrolia one forenoon something impelled\r\nme to go to Tidioute, a hundred miles north, and spend the night. Rising\r\nfrom breakfast at the Empire House next morning, a loud report, as\r\nthough a battery of boilers had burst, hurried me to the street. Ten\r\nminutes later found me gazing upon the Dalrymple horror. Was the cause\r\nof the impulse that started me from Petrolia explained? An hour sufficed\r\nto help rescue the child from the debris, inspect the wreck, glean full\r\nparticulars and board the train for Irvineton. Writing the account for\r\nthe Oil-City _Derrick_ at my leisure, Postmaster Evans was on hand with\r\na report of the inquest when the evening-train reached Tidioute. The\r\nTidioute _Journal_ didn’t like the _Derrick_ a little bit and the sight\r\nof a young man running from its office towards the train, with copies of\r\nthe paper—not dry from the press—attracted my attention. Mr. Evans said\r\ntwo Titusville reporters had come over during the day. A newspaper-man\r\nclearly relishes a “scoop” and it struck me at once that the _Journal_\r\nwas rushing the first sheets of its edition to the Titusville delegates.\r\nSqueezing through the jam, A. E. Fay, of the _Courier_, and “Charlie”\r\nMorse, of the _Herald_, were pocketing the copies handed them by the\r\n_Journal_ youth. Fay laughed out loud and said: “Well, boys, I guess the\r\n_Derrick’s_ left this time!” A pat on the shoulder and my hint to “guess\r\nagain” fairly paralyzed the trio. The conductor shouted “all aboard” and\r\nthe train moved off. Dropping into the seat in front of Fay, his\r\nannoyance could not be concealed. It relieved him to hear me tell of\r\ncoming through from the north and ask why such a crowd had gathered at\r\nTidioute. He told a fairy-story of a ball-game and his own and Morse’s\r\nvisit to meet a friend! A wish for a glance at the Tidioute paper he\r\nparried by answering: “It’s yesterday’s issue!” Fay was a good fellow\r\nand his clumsy falsifying would have shamed Ananias. Keeping him on the\r\nrack was rare sport. Clearly he believed me ignorant of the\r\ntorpedo-accident. The moment to undeceive him arrived. A big roll of\r\nmanuscript held before his eyes, with a “scare-head” and minute details\r\nof the tragedy, prefaced the query: “Do you still think the _Derrick_ is\r\nbadly left?” Many friends have asked me: “In your travels through the\r\noil-region what was the funniest thing you ever saw?” Here is the\r\nanswer: The dazed look of Fay as he beheld that manuscript, turned red\r\nand white, clenched his fists, gritted his teeth and hissed, “Damn you!”\r\n\r\nJohn Osborne, a youth well-known and well-liked, in July of 1874 drove a\r\nbuckboard loaded with glycerine down Bear-Creek Valley, two miles below\r\nParker. The cargo let go at a rough piece of road in a woody ravine,\r\nscattering Osborne, the horse and the vehicle over acres of tree-tops.\r\nThe concussion was felt three miles. Venango, Crawford, Warren and\r\nArmstrong counties had furnished nearly a score of sacrifices and Butler\r\nwas to supply the next. Alonzo Taylor, young and unmarried, went in the\r\nsummer of 1875 to torpedo a well at Troutman. The drop-weight failed to\r\nexplode the percussion-cap and Taylor drew up the shell, a process that\r\nhad cost Captain West his life and was always risky. He got it out\r\nsafely and bore the torpedo to a hill to examine the priming. An instant\r\nlater a frightful explosion stunned the neighborhood. Taylor was not\r\nmangled beyond recognition, as the charge was giant-powder instead of\r\nNitro-Glycerine. Nor was the damage to surrounding objects very great,\r\nowing to the tendency of the powder to expend its strength downward.\r\nThis was the only torpedo-fatality of the year, the number of casualties\r\nhaving induced greater caution in handling explosives.\r\n\r\nOne of the first persons to reach the spot and gather the remains of\r\nWilliam Pine was his friend James Barnum, who died in the same manner at\r\nSt. Petersburg eighteen months later. Barnum was the Roberts agent in\r\nClarion county. On February twenty-third, 1876, he drove to Edenburg for\r\nthree-hundred pounds of glycerine, to store in the magazine a mile from\r\nSt. Petersburg. A fearful concussion, which the writer can never forget,\r\nbroke hundreds of windows and rocked houses to their foundations at six\r\no’clock that evening. To the magazine, on a slope sheltered by trees,\r\npeople hastened. A huge iron-safe, imbedded in a cave dug into the hill,\r\nwas the repository of the explosives. Barnum had tied his team to a\r\nsmall tree and must have been taking the cans from the wagon to the\r\nsafe. A yawning cavity indicated the site of the magazine. Both horses\r\nlay dead and disemboweled. The biggest piece of the luckless agent would\r\nnot weigh two pounds. One of his ears was found next morning a half-mile\r\naway. The few remnants were collected in a box and buried at Franklin. A\r\nwife and several children mourned poor “Jim,” who was a lively, active\r\nyoung man and had often been warned not to be so careless with the\r\ndeadly stuff. Mrs. Barnum heard the explosion, uttered a piercing shriek\r\nand ran wildly from her house towards the magazine, sure her husband had\r\nbeen killed.\r\n\r\nW. H. Harper, who received a patent for improvements in torpedoes, went\r\nto his doom at Keating’s Furnace, two miles from St. Petersburg, in July\r\nof 1876. Drawing an unexploded shell from a well, precisely as West and\r\nTaylor had done, he stooped down to examine the priming. The contents\r\nexploded and drove pieces of the tin-shell deep into his flesh and\r\nthrough his body. How he survived nine days was a wonder to all who saw\r\nthe dreadful wounds of the unlucky inventor.\r\n\r\nMcKean county supplied the next instance. Repeated attempts were made to\r\nrob a large magazine on the Curtis farm, two miles south of Bradford.\r\nIncredible as it may seem, the key-hole of the ponderous iron-safe in\r\nthe hillside was several times stuffed with Nitro-Glycerine and a long\r\nfuse and a slow match applied to burst the door. None of these foolhardy\r\nattempts succeeding, on the night of September fifteenth, 1877, A. V.\r\nPulser, J. B. Burkholder, Andrew P. Higgins and Charles S. Page, two of\r\nthem “moonlighters,” it is supposed tried pounding the lock with a\r\nhammer. At any rate, they exploded the magazine and were blown to\r\nfragments, with all the gruesome accompaniments incident to such\r\ncatastrophes. That men would imperil their lives to loot a safe of\r\nNitro-Glycerine in the dark beats the old story of the thief who essayed\r\nto steal a red-hot stove. In this case retribution was swift and\r\nterrible, but a magazine at St. Petersburg was broken open and plundered\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nSeventeen days later J. T. Smith, of Titusville, who had charge of a\r\nmagazine on Bolivar Run, four miles from Bradford, lost his life\r\nexperimenting with glycerine. Col. E. A. L. Roberts and his nephew, Owen\r\nRoberts, stood fifty yards from the magazine as Smith was thrown into\r\nthe air and frightfully mangled. They escaped with slight bruises, a\r\nlively shaking up and a hair-raising fright.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1878 was a busy season in the northern field. Foster-Brook\r\nValley was at the hey-day of activity, with hundreds of wells drilling\r\nand well-shooters very much in evidence. Among the most expert men in\r\nthe employ of the Roberts Company was J. Bartlett, of Bradford. He went\r\nto Red Rock, an ephemeral oil-town six miles north-east of Bradford, to\r\ntorpedo a well in rear of the McClure House, the principal hostelry.\r\nAlthough Bartlett’s recklessness was the source of uneasiness, he had\r\nnever met with an accident and was considered extremely fortunate. It\r\nwas a rule to explode the cans that had held the glycerine before\r\npouring it into the shell. Bartlett torpedoed the well, piled wood\r\naround the empty cans and set it on fire. He and a party of friends\r\nwaited at the hotel for the cans to explode. The fire had burned low and\r\nBartlett proceeded to investigate. He lifted a can and turned it over,\r\nto see if it contained any glycerine. The act was followed by an\r\nexplosion that shook every house in the town and shattered numberless\r\nwindows. Bartlett’s companions were knocked senseless and the shooter\r\nwas blown one-hundred feet. When picked up by several men, who hurried\r\nto the scene, he presented a horrible sight. His clothing was torn to\r\nribbons and his body riddled by pieces of tin. The right arm was off\r\nclose to the shoulder and the right leg was a pulp. He was removed to a\r\nboarding-house and died in great agony three hours after.\r\n\r\nStories of hapless “moonlighters” scattered to the four winds of heaven\r\nwere recounted frequently. Their business, done largely under cover of\r\ndarkness, was exceptionally dangerous. The “moonlighter” did not haul\r\nhis load in a wagon openly by daylight. He would place two ten-quart\r\ncans of glycerine in a meal-sack, sling the bag over his shoulder and\r\nwalk to the scene of his intended operations, generally at night. One\r\nevening in the spring of 1879 a “moonlighter” named Reed appeared at Red\r\nRock, somewhat intoxicated and bearing two cans of glycerine in a bag.\r\nHe handled the bag in a style that struck terror to the hearts of all\r\nonlookers, many of whom remembered poor Bartlett. It was unsafe to wrest\r\nit from him by force and the Red-Rockers heaved a sigh of relief when he\r\nstarted to climb the hill leading to Summit City. Scores watched him,\r\nexpecting an accident. At a rough spot Reed stumbled and the cans fell\r\nto the ground. A terrific explosion shook the surrounding country. A\r\ndeep hole, ten feet in diameter, was blown in the earth and houses in\r\nthe vicinity were badly shaken. The explosion occurred directly under a\r\ntree. When an attempt was made to gather up Reed’s remains the greater\r\nportion of the body was in the tree, scraps of flesh of various sizes\r\nhanging from its branches. The concussion passed above Red Rock, hence\r\nthe damage to property was small. Reed was dispersed over an acre of\r\nbrush, a fearful illustration of the incompatibility of whisky and\r\nNitro-Glycerine.\r\n\r\nW. O. Gotham, John Fowler and Harry French went to their usual work at\r\nGotham’s Nitro-Glycerine factory, near Petrolia, on the morning of\r\nOctober twenty-seventh, 1878. An explosion during the forenoon tore\r\nFowler to shreds, mutilated French shockingly and landed Gotham’s dead\r\nbody in the stream with hardly a sign of injury. Petrolia never\r\nwitnessed a sadder funeral-procession than the long one that followed\r\nthe unfortunate three to the tomb. Gotham had a family and was widely\r\nknown; the others were strangers, far from home and loved ones.\r\n\r\nOn February twentieth, 1880, James Feeney and Leonard Tackett started in\r\na sleigh with six cans under the seat to torpedo a well at Tram Hollow,\r\neight miles east by north of Bradford. The sleigh slipped into a rut on\r\na rough side-hill and capsized. The glycerine exploded, throwing Tackett\r\nhigh in the air and mangling him considerably. Feeney lay flat in the\r\nrut, the violence of the shock passing over him and covering him with\r\nsnow and fence-rails. His face was scorched and his hearing destroyed,\r\nbut he managed to crawl out, the first man who ever emerged alive from\r\nthe jaws of a Nitro-Glycerine eruption. He is still a resident of\r\nBradford. A dwelling close to the scene was wrecked, the falling timbers\r\nseriously injuring two of the inmates.\r\n\r\nAt two o’clock on the morning of December twenty-third, 1880, a powerful\r\nconcussion startled the people of Bradford from their slumbers, caused\r\nby a glycerine-explosion just below the city-limits. Alvin Magee was\r\nstanding over the deadly compound, which had been put in a tub of hot\r\nwater to thaw. Usually the subtle stuff is stored in a cold place, to\r\ncongeal or freeze until needed. Magee and the derrick were blown into\r\nspace, only a few bits of flesh and bone and splintered wood remaining.\r\nHis two companions were in the engine-house and got off with severe\r\nbruises and permanent deafness. Two men named Cushing and Leasure were\r\nkilled the same way in January, at a well near Limestone. Cushing came\r\nto see the torpedo put into the well and was standing near the\r\nengine-house, into which Leasure had just gone, when the accident\r\noccurred. The glycerine was in hot water to thaw and a jet of steam\r\nturned on, with the effect of sending it off prematurely. Cushing’s body\r\ndid not show a mark, his death probably resulting from concussion, while\r\nLeasure was torn to fragments.\r\n\r\nE. M. Pearsall, of Oil City, died on July fourteenth, 1880, from the\r\neffect of burns a few hours before. In company with two other men he\r\nwent to torpedo one of his wells on the Clapp farm. The tubing had been\r\ndrawn out and a large amount of benzine poured into the hole. The\r\ntorpedo was exploded, when the gas and benzine took fire and enveloped\r\nthe men and rig in flames. The clothes of Pearsall, who was nearest to\r\nthe derrick, caught fire and burned from his body. His limbs, face and\r\nbreast were a fearful sight. His intense suffering he bore like a hero,\r\nmade a will and calmly awaited death, which came to his relief at nine\r\no’clock in the evening. Pearsall was dark-haired, dark-eyed, slender,\r\nwiry and fearless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLUMER MITCHELL.]\r\n\r\nJ. Plumer Mitchell—we called him “Plum”—worked for me on the\r\n_Independent Press_ at Franklin in 1879-80. Everybody liked the bright,\r\ngenial, capable young man who set type, read proof, wrote locals,\r\nsolicited advertisements and won golden opinions. He married and was the\r\nproud father of two winsome children. Meeting me on the street one day\r\nshortly after quitting the _Press_, we chatted briefly.\r\n\r\n“I am through with sticking type,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What are you driving at now?”\r\n\r\n“Torpedoing wells. I started on Monday.”\r\n\r\n“Well, be sure you get good pay, for it’s risky business, and don’t\r\nfurnish a thrilling paragraph for the obituary-column.”\r\n\r\n“I shall do my best to steer clear of that. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nThat was our last meeting. He met the fate that overtook West, Taylor\r\nand Harper, shooting a well at Galloway. The shattered frame rests in\r\nthe cemetery and the widow and fatherless daughters of the lamented dead\r\nreside at Franklin. Poor “Plum!”\r\n\r\nT. A. McClain, an employé of the Roberts Company, was hauling\r\ntwo-hundred quarts of glycerine in a sleigh from Davis Switch to Kinzua\r\nJunction, on February fourteenth, 1881. The horses frightened and ran\r\noff. The sleigh is supposed to have struck a stump and the cargo\r\nexploded. Hardly a trace of McClain could be found and a bit of the\r\nsteel-shoeing was the only part of the sleigh recovered. Obliteration\r\nmore complete it would be difficult to imagine.\r\n\r\nThe most destructive sacrifice of life followed on September seventh.\r\nCharles Rust, a Bradford shooter, drove to Sawyer City to torpedo a well\r\non the Jane Schoonover farm. It is alleged that Rust had domestic\r\ntrouble, wearied of life and told his wife when leaving that morning he\r\nwould never return. A small crowd assembled to witness the operation.\r\nWilliam Bunton, owner of several adjacent wells, Charles Crouse, known\r\nas “Big Charlie the Moonlighter,” James Thrasher, tool-dresser, and Rust\r\nwere on the derrick-floor. Rust filled the first shell, fixed the\r\nfiring-head and struck the cap two sharp blows with his left hand. There\r\nwas a blinding flash, then a deafening report. Dust, smoke and missiles\r\nfilled the air. The derrick was demolished and pieces of board flew\r\nhundreds of yards with the force of cannon-balls. One hit Crouse in the\r\ncenter of the forehead and passed through the skull. His face was\r\nterribly lacerated and the clothing stripped off his body. Bunton and\r\nThrasher were not mangled beyond recognition, while Rust was thrown a\r\nhundred yards. His legs were missing, the face was battered out of the\r\nsemblance of humanity and not a vestige of clothing was left on the\r\nmutilated trunk. Frederick Slatterly, a lad on his way to school, was\r\nhit by a piece of the derrick, which ripped his abdomen and caused death\r\nin three hours. Three boys walking behind young Slatterly were thrown\r\ndown and hurt slightly. Mr. Bunton gasped when picked up and lived five\r\nminutes. He was an estimable citizen, an elder in the Presbyterian\r\nchurch, intelligent and broad-minded. Thrasher and Crouse were\r\nindustrious workmen. Edward Wilson, a gauger, standing ten rods away,\r\nwas perforated by slivers and pieces of tin, his injuries confining him\r\nto bed several months. Thomas Buton and John Sisley were at the side of\r\nthe derrick, within six feet of Rust, yet escaped with trifling\r\ninjuries. The tragedy produced a sensation, all the more fearful from\r\nthe belief of some who witnessed it that Rust intended to commit suicide\r\nand in compassing his own death killed four innocent victims.\r\n\r\nThe Roberts magazine on the Hatfield farm, two miles south of Bradford,\r\nblew up on the night of October thirteenth, 1881. Nobody doubted it was\r\nthe work of “moonlighters” attempting to steal the glycerine. Traces of\r\nblood and minute portions of flesh on the stones and ties indicated that\r\ntwo persons at least were engaged in the job. Who they were none ever\r\nlearned.\r\n\r\nJohn McCleary, a Roberts shooter, had a remarkable escape on December\r\ntwenty-seventh, 1881. While filling the shell at a well near Haymaker,\r\nin the lower oil-field, the well flowed and McCleary left the derrick.\r\nThe column of oil threw down the shell and the glycerine exploded\r\npromptly, wrecking the derrick and tossing the fleeing man violently to\r\nthe ground. He rose to his feet as four cans on the derrick-floor cut\r\nloose. McCleary was borne fifty feet through the air, jagged splinters\r\nof tin and wood pierced his back and sides and he fell stunned and\r\nbleeding. He was not injured fatally. Like Feeney, Buton and Sisley, he\r\nsurvives to tell of his close call. Less fortunate was Henry W. McHenry,\r\nwho had torpedoed hundreds of wells and was blown to atoms near Simpson\r\nStation, in the southern end of the Bradford region, on February fifth,\r\n1883. His fate resembled West’s, Taylor’s, Harper’s and Mitchell’s.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1884 Lark Easton went to torpedo a well at Coleville,\r\nseven miles southeast of Bradford. He tied his team in the woods,\r\ncarried some cans of glycerine to the well and left four in the wagon. A\r\nstorm blew down a tree, which fell on the wagon and exploded the\r\nglycerine, demolishing the vehicle and killing one horse. It was a lucky\r\nescape, if not much of a lark, for Easton.\r\n\r\nA peculiar case was that of “Doc” Haggerty, a teamster employed to haul\r\nNitro-Glycerine to the magazine near Pleasantville. In December of 1888\r\nhe took fourteen-hundred pounds on his wagon and was seen at the\r\nmagazine twenty minutes before a furious explosion occurred. Pieces of\r\nthe horses and wagon were found, but not an atom of Haggerty. He had\r\ndisappeared as completely as Elijah in the chariot of fire. An\r\ninsurance-company, in which he held a five-thousand-dollar policy,\r\nresisted payment on the ground that, as no remains of the alleged dead\r\nman could be produced, he might be alive! Some pretexts for declining to\r\npay a policy are pretty mean, but this certainly capped the climax.\r\nExperts believed the heat generated by the explosion was sufficient to\r\ncremate the body instantaneously, bones, clothes, boots and all.\r\n\r\nJames Woods and William Medeller, two experienced shooters, were ushered\r\ninto eternity on December tenth, 1889, by the explosion of the Humes\r\nTorpedo-Company’s magazine at Bean Hollow, two miles south of Butler.\r\nThey had gone for glycerine and that was the end of their mortal\r\npilgrimage. Six years later, on December fourth, 1895, at the same place\r\nand in the same way, George Bester and Lewis Black lost their lives.\r\nBester was blown to atoms and only a few threads of his clothing could\r\nbe picked up. The lower part of Black’s face, the trunk and right arm\r\nremained together, while other portions of the body were strewn around.\r\nThe left arm was in a tree three-hundred yards distant. Huge holes\r\nmarked the site of the two Humes magazines, a hundred feet apart. The\r\nmangled horse lay between them, every bone in his carcass broken and the\r\nharness cut off clean. The buggy was in fragments, with one tire wrapped\r\nfive times about a small tree. Not a board stayed on the boiler-house\r\nand the boiler was moved twenty feet and dismantled. The factory,\r\ntwo-hundred feet from the magazines, was utterly wrecked. The young men\r\nleft Butler early in the morning, Black going for company. The\r\nsupposition is that Bester was removing some of the cans from the shelf,\r\nintending to take them out, and that he dropped one of them. About\r\nseven-hundred pounds of glycerine were stored in one of the magazines\r\nand a less amount in the other. George Bester was twenty-eight and had a\r\nwife and two small children. He was industrious, steady and one of the\r\nbest shooters in the business. Black was twenty and lived with his\r\nparents. The concussion jarred every house in Butler, broke windows and\r\nloosened plaster in the McKean school-building, causing a panic among\r\nthe children.\r\n\r\nW. N. Downing’s death, on January second, 1891, at the Victor\r\nOil-Company’s well, in the Archer’s Forks oil-field, near Wheeling, West\r\nVirginia, was very singular. The glycerine used to torpedo the well the\r\nprevious day had been thawed in a barrel of warm water. Next day two of\r\nthe owners drove out to see the well and talk with Downing, who was\r\nforeman of the company. On their way back to Wheeling they heard an\r\nexplosion, conjectured the boiler had burst and returned to the lease.\r\nMr. Downing’s body lay near where the barrel of water had stood. The\r\nbarrel had vanished and a large hole occupied its place. The victim’s\r\nhead was cut off on a line with the eyes. The only explanation of the\r\naccident was that the glycerine had leaked into the barrel and a sudden\r\njar had caused the stuff to explode. Beside the well, in the\r\nfence-corner, were twelve cans of glycerine not exploded. Downing lived\r\nat Siverlyville, above Oil City, whither his remains were brought for\r\ninterment.\r\n\r\nLetting a torpedo down a well at Bradford in September of 1877, a flow\r\nof oil jerked it out, hurled the shell against the tools, which were\r\nhanging in the derrick, and set off the nitro on the double quick. The\r\nshooter jumped and ran at the first symptoms of trouble, the derrick was\r\nsliced in the middle and set on fire. The rig burned and strenuous\r\nexertions alone saved neighboring wells. The fire was a novelty in the\r\ncareer of the explosive.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Nitro-Glycerine goes off by spontaneous combustion without\r\napparent provocation. On December fifth, 1881, two of the employés\r\nnoticed a thin smoke rising from the top row of cans in the Roberts\r\nmagazine at Kinzua Junction. They retreated, came back and removed\r\neighty cans, observed the smoke increasing in density and volume and\r\ndecided to watch further proceedings from a safe distance.\r\nTwelve-hundred quarts exploded with such vigor that the earth jarred for\r\nmiles and a big hole was ploughed in the rock. In November of 1885 the\r\nRock Glycerine-Company’s factory on Minard Run, four miles south of\r\nBradford, was wrecked for the fourth time. O. Wood and A. Brown were\r\nrunning the mixture into “the drowning tank,” to divest it of the acid.\r\nThe process generates much heat and acid escaping from a leak in the\r\ntank fired the wood-work. Wood and Brown and a carpenter in the\r\nbuilding, knowing their deliverance depended upon their speed, took\r\nFrench leave. Samuel Barber, a teamster, was unloading a drum of acid in\r\nfront of the building and joined the fugitives in their flight. The\r\nglycerine obligingly waited until the four men reached a safe spot and\r\nthen reduced the factory to kindling-wood. Barber’s horses and wagon\r\nwere not hurt mortally, the animals bleeding a little from the nose.\r\nNext evening Tucker’s factory at Corwin Centre, six miles north-east of\r\nBradford, followed suit. Griffin Rathburn, who was making a run of the\r\nfluids, fled for his life as the mass emitted a flame. He saved himself,\r\nbut the factory and a thousand pounds of the explosive went on an aërial\r\nexcursion.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1896, at Pine Fork, West Virginia, William Conn drove a\r\ntwo-horse wagon to the magazine for glycerine to shoot a well. While\r\nConn was inside two men drove up with two horses. That moment the\r\nmagazine exploded with a report heard ten miles off. Only a piece of a\r\nman’s foot was ever found. Thus three human beings, two wagons and four\r\nhorses were extinguished utterly.\r\n\r\nOn December twenty-third, 1896, a half-ton of glycerine blew up near\r\nMontpelier, Indiana. Two men and two teams were the victims. The forest\r\nwas mowed down for hundreds of feet. Oak-trees three feet in diameter\r\nwere cut off like mullein-stalks. A steel-tire from one wagon was coiled\r\ntightly around a small tree. One of the shooters was John Hickok, a\r\ngiant in stature. He was unusually cheerful that morning. He kissed his\r\nwife and daughter good-bye and said, in answer to the query if he would\r\nbe home to dinner, “You know, Jennie, we are never sure of coming back.”\r\n\r\nBy the explosion of a magazine at Shannopin, eighteen miles from\r\nPittsburg, in January, 1897, two men and two girls were killed, one man\r\nwas injured, buildings were shattered and part of the public-school was\r\ndemolished. The concussion broke windows at Economy and Coraopolis and\r\nwas felt thirty miles distant.\r\n\r\nOn February twenty-fifth, 1897, a similar accident at the magazine three\r\nmiles west of Steubenville, Ohio, blew Louis Crary and Eugene Ralston\r\ninto bits too small to be gathered up. Both were in the frame building\r\ncontaining the iron-safe that held the explosive when the whole thing\r\nwent into the air. At Celina, on April second, Cornelius O’Donnell and\r\nJohn Baird perished, one finger alone remaining to prove they had ever\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nNear Wellsville, New York, on March third, three tons of the stuff let\r\ngo, probably from spontaneous combustion, leaving a yawning chasm where\r\nthe magazine of the Rock Glycerine-Company had been erected. Nobody was\r\nnear enough to be hurt. Next day John Pike and Lewis Washabaugh met\r\ntheir fate at Orchard Park. Washabaugh went to the magazine to examine\r\nits contents and the explosion occurred as he opened the door, tearing\r\nhim to pieces. Pike, who stood a hundred yards away, was killed\r\ninstantly. On March twenty-second, at the Farren farm, two miles from\r\nWellsville, six-hundred quarts of the compound sent Henry H. Youngs to\r\nhis death. His young wife heard the warning note and ran bareheaded\r\nthrough the deep mud to the scene. Doctor Clark and Thomas Myers were\r\ndriving posts five hundred feet from the magazine when Youngs drove past\r\nfor his load. Myers wanted to leave the spot, fearing an accident, but\r\nClark laughed at him and they continued working. At nine o’clock Myers\r\nstood upon a saw-horse mauling away at a post. Suddenly he was thrown\r\nover and over, performing several somersaults. He soon realized that the\r\nterrible explosion he feared had taken place. With bloody face, bruised\r\nbody and a limping gait he arose. Smoke ascended over the site of the\r\nmagazine. Man and horses and wagon were gone. Clark was slowly rolling\r\nhimself over the ground and groaning from an injury in the region of the\r\nstomach. Both men gasped for breath. Scraps of clothing and shreds of\r\nflesh were all that could be picked up.\r\n\r\nC. N. Brown, manager of a torpedo-company, lost his life on April first\r\nwhile shooting a well near Evans City, in Butler county. He had placed\r\npart of the charge in the hole and was filling another shell on the\r\nderrick-floor. Face and limbs were blown to the four winds, a portion of\r\nskull dropping in the field. Brown was an expert shooter and a can\r\nprobably slipped from his hands to the floor so forcibly as to explode.\r\nHe expected to quit the business that week.\r\n\r\nWithin sight of Marietta, Ohio, on August third, a wagon loaded with\r\nnitro-glycerine dropped into a chuck hole in the road, setting off the\r\ncargo. The driver, John McCleary, and the horses were scattered far and\r\nwide. Half of a hoof was the largest fragment left of man or beast.\r\nThomas Martin, working on the road a hundred yards away, was hit by a\r\npiece of the wagon and died instantly. John Williams, riding a horse\r\nthree-hundred yards beyond Martin, was pitched from his saddle and\r\npainfully bruised.\r\n\r\nSamuel Barber torpedoed George Grant’s well, in the middle of the town\r\nof Cygnet, on September seventh. A heavy flow of gas and a stream of oil\r\nfollowed. The gas caught fire from the boiler, a hundred yards back,\r\nfilling the air with a sheet of solid flame. Men, women and children\r\nwere burned badly in trying to escape. Barber, clad in oily clothing\r\nthat burned furiously, ran until he fell and was burned fatally. A store\r\nand office were consumed and the multitude supposed all danger had\r\npassed. Forty quarts of the explosive had not been taken from the\r\nderrick. The terrific explosion killed five men outright, three others\r\nexpired in a few hours, nine houses were wrecked and every pane of glass\r\nin town was broken. Eight months previously two men were killed at\r\nCygnet by the explosion of a magazine.\r\n\r\nWarren VanBuren, of Bolivar, a noted shooter, has exploded\r\nthree-thousand torpedoes in oil-wells and is still in the business.\r\nThree years ago two of his brothers worked with him. One of them tripped\r\non a gas-pipe and fell, while carrying a can of nitro-glycerine to his\r\nwagon, with the usual result. All that could be found of his body was\r\nplaced in a cigar-box. The other brother retired from the business next\r\nday, bought a fruit-farm, returned to the oil-country lately and he is\r\nagain pursuing his old vocation.\r\n\r\nJohn Jeffersey, an Indian pilot, died at Tionesta in 1894. One dark\r\nnight he plunged into the Allegheny, near Brady’s Bend, to grasp a skiff\r\nloaded with cans of glycerine that brushed past his raft. Jacob Barry\r\nand Richard Spooner jumped from the skiff as it touched the raft,\r\nbelieving an explosion inevitable, and sank beneath the waters. As\r\n“Indian John” caught the boat he yelled: “Me got it him! Me run it him\r\nand tie!” He guided the craft through the pitchy darkness and anchored\r\nit safely. Had it drifted down the river a sad accident might have been\r\nthe sequel. Happily Americanite, quite as powerful and much safer, is\r\ndisplacing nitro-glycerine.\r\n\r\nAndrew Dalrymple, who perished at Tidioute, was at his brother’s well\r\nten minutes before the fatal explosion and said to the pumper: “I have\r\nfive-hundred dollars in my trousers and next week I’m going west to\r\nsettle on a farm.” Man and wife and money were blotted out ruthlessly\r\nand the trip west was a trip into eternity instead.\r\n\r\nFrequently loads of explosives are hauled through the streets of towns\r\nin the oil-regions, despite stringent ordinances and lynx-eyed\r\npolicemen. Once a well-known handler of glycerine was arrested and taken\r\nbefore the mayor of Oil City. He denied violating the law by carrying\r\nthe stuff in his buggy. An officer bore a can at arm’s length and laid\r\nit tenderly on the floor. “Now, you won’t deny it?” interrogated the\r\nmayor. “No,” replied the prisoner, “there seems to be a lot of it.” Then\r\nhe hit the can a vicious kick, sending it against the wall with a thud.\r\nThe spectators fled and the mayor tried to climb through the\r\nback-window. The can didn’t explode, the agent put it to his lips, took\r\na hearty quaff and remarked: “Mr. Mayor, try a nip; you’ll find this\r\nwhisky goes right to the ticklish spot!”\r\n\r\nMen in Ohio, West Virginia and Indiana have added to the dismal roll of\r\nthose who, leaving home happy and buoyant in the morning, ere the sun\r\nset were dispersed over acres of territory. Yet all experiences with the\r\ndread compound have not been serious, for at intervals a comic incident\r\nbrightens the page. Robert L. Wilson, a blacksmith on Cherry Run in\r\n1869-70, was a first-class tool-manufacturer. Joining the Butler tide,\r\nhe opened a shop at Modoc. A fellow of giant-build entered one day,\r\nbragged of his muscle as well as his stuttering tongue would permit and\r\nwanted work. Something about the fellow displeased Wilson, who was of\r\nmedium size and thin as Job’s turkey, and he decided to have a little\r\nfun at the stranger’s expense. He asked the burly visitor whether he\r\ncould strike the anvil a heavier blow than any other man in the shop.\r\nThe chap responded yes and Wilson agreed to hire him if he proved his\r\nclaim good. Wilson poured two or three drops of what looked like\r\nlard-oil on the anvil and the big ’un braced himself to bring down the\r\nsledge-hammer with the force of a pile-driver. He struck the exact spot.\r\nThe sledge soared through the roof and the giant was pitched against the\r\nside of the building hard enough to knock off a half-dozen boards. When\r\nhe extracted himself from the mess and regained breath he blurted out:\r\n“I t-t-told you I co-cou-could hi-hi-hit a he-he-hell of a b-bl-blow!”\r\n“Right,” said Wilson, “you can beat any of us; be on hand to-morrow\r\nmorning to begin work.” The man worked faithfully and did not discover\r\nfor months that the stuff on the anvil was Nitro-Glycerine.\r\n\r\nThe farm-house of Albert Jones, three miles from Auburn, Illinois, was\r\ndemolished on a Sunday afternoon in November of 1885. Jones had procured\r\nsome Nitro-Glycerine to remove stumps and set the can on the floor of\r\nthe dining-room. After dinner the family visited a neighbor, locking up\r\nthe house. About three o’clock a thundering detonation alarmed the\r\nAuburnites, who couldn’t understand the cause of the rumpus. A messenger\r\nfrom the country enlightened them. The Jones domicile had been wrecked\r\nmysteriously and the family must have perished. Excited people soon\r\narrived and the Joneses put in an appearance. The house and furniture\r\nwere scattered in tiny tidbits over an area of five-hundred yards. Half\r\nthe original height of the four walls was standing, with a saw-tooth and\r\nsplintered fringe all around the irregular top of the oblong. Two beds\r\nwere found several hundred yards apart, in the road in front of the\r\nhouse. A sewing-machine was buried head-first in the flower-garden.\r\nWearing-apparel and household-articles were strewn about the place.\r\nWhile Mr. Jones and a circle of friends were viewing the wreck and\r\nwondering how the Nitro-Glycerine exploded a faint cry was heard. A\r\nsearch resulted in finding the family-cat in the branches of a tree\r\nfifty feet from the dwelling. It was surmised the cat caused the\r\ndisaster by pushing from the table some article sufficiently heavy to\r\nexplode the glycerine on the floor. The New York _Sun’s_ famous\r\ngrimalkin should have retired to a back-fence and begun his final\r\ncaterwauling over the superior performance of the Illinois feline. Jones\r\nand his friends unanimously endorsed the verdict: “It was the cat.”\r\n\r\nThe first statement coupling a hog and Nitro-Glycerine in one package\r\nwas written by me in December of 1869, at Rouseville, and printed in the\r\nOil-City _Times_. The item went the rounds of the press in America and\r\nEurope, many papers giving due credit and many localizing the narrative\r\nto palm it off as original. One of the latter was “Brick” Pomeroy’s La\r\nCrosse _Democrat_, which laid the scene in that neck of woods. The tale\r\nhas often been resurrected and it was reported in a New-Orleans paper\r\nlast month. The original version of “The Loaded Porker” read thus:\r\n\r\n“Rouseville furnishes the latest unpatented novelty in connection with\r\nNitro-Glycerine. A torpedo-man had taken a small parcel of the dangerous\r\ncompound from the magazine and on his return dropped into an\r\nengine-house a few minutes, leaving the vessel beside the door. A\r\nrampant hog, in search of a rare Christmas dinner, discovered the\r\ntempting package and unceremoniously devoured the entire contents, just\r\nfinishing the last atom as the torpedoist emerged from the building! Now\r\neverybody gives the greedy animal the widest latitude. It has full\r\npossession of the whole sidewalk whenever disposed to promenade. All the\r\ndogs in town have been placed in solitary confinement, for fear they\r\nmight chase the loaded porker against a post. No one is sufficiently\r\nreckless to kick the critter, lest it should unexpectedly explode and\r\nsend the town and its total belongings to everlasting smash! The matter\r\nis really becoming serious and how to dispose safely of a gormandizing\r\nswine that has imbibed two quarts of infernal glycerine is the grand\r\nconundrum of the hour. When he is killed and ground up into sausage and\r\nhead-cheese a new terror will be added to the long list that\r\nboarding-houses possess already.”\r\n\r\nCharles Foster, of the High-Explosive Company, had an adventure in March\r\nof 1896 that he would not repeat for a hatful of diamonds. He loaded\r\nfive-hundred quarts of glycerine at the magazine near Kane City. On Rynd\r\nHill the horses slipped and one fell. The driver jumped from his seat to\r\nhold the animal’s head that it might not struggle. He cut the other\r\nhorse free from the harness, as the road skirted a precipice and the\r\nfrightened beast’s rearing and plunging would almost certainly dump the\r\nwagon and outfit over the steep bank. Nobody was in sight, the driver\r\nhad no chance to block the wheels and the wagon started down the hill\r\nbackward. The vehicle, with its load of condensed destruction, kept the\r\nroad a few yards and pitched over the hill, turning somersaults in its\r\ndescent. It brought up standing on the tongue in a heap of stones. The\r\ncovers were torn off the wagon and the cans of the explosive were widely\r\nscattered. Seven in one bunch were picked up ten yards below the road. A\r\nthree-cornered hole had been jammed in the bottom of one of the\r\neight-quart cans and the contents were escaping. Darkness came on before\r\nthe glycerine could be removed to a place of safety. Foster secured a\r\nrig and drove home, after arranging to have the stuff taken to the\r\nfactory next morning. How the explosive, although congealed, stood the\r\nshock of going over the hill and scattering about without soaring\r\nskyward is one of the unfathomed mysteries of the Nitro-Glycerine\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nA Polish resident of South Oil City carried home what he took to be an\r\nempty tomato-can. His wife chanced to upset it from a shelf in the\r\nkitchen. A few drops of glycerine must have adhered to the tin. The can\r\nburst with fearful violence, blowing out one side of the kitchen,\r\ndestroying the woman’s eyes and nearly blinding her little daughter. A\r\nwoman at Rouseville poured glycerine, mistaking it for lard-oil, into a\r\nfrying-pan on the stove, just as her husband came into the kitchen. He\r\nsnatched up the pan and landed it in a snow-bank so quickly the stuff\r\ndidn’t burst the combination. The wife started to scold him, but fainted\r\nwhen he explained the situation.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful explosion at Hell-Gate in 1876, when General Newton fired\r\ntwo-hundred tons of dynamite and cleared a channel into New-York harbor\r\nfor the largest steamships, brought to the front the men who always tell\r\nof something that beats the record. A group sat discussing Newton’s\r\nachievement at the Collins House, Oil City, as a Southerner with a\r\nmilitary title entered. Catching the drift of the argument he said:\r\n\r\n“Talk about sending rocks and water up in the air! I knew a case that\r\nknocked the socks clear off this little ripple at New York!”\r\n\r\n“Tell us all about it, Colonel,” the party chorused.\r\n\r\n“You see I used to live down in Tennessee. One day I met a farmer\r\ndriving a mule that looked as innocent as a cherub. The farmer had a\r\nwhip with a brad in the end of it. Just as I came up he gave the mule a\r\nprod. Next moment he was gone. It almost took my breath away to see a\r\nchap snuffed out so quick. The mule merely ducked his head and struck\r\nout behind. A crash, a cloud of splinters and the mule and I were alone,\r\nwith not a trace of farmer or wagon in sight. Next day the papers had\r\naccounts of a shower of flesh over in Kentucky and I was the only person\r\nwho could explain the phenomenon. No, gentlemen, the dynamite and\r\nNitro-Glycerine at Hell-Gate couldn’t hold a candle to that Tennessee\r\nmule!”\r\n\r\nThe silence that followed this tale was as dense as a London fog and\r\nmight have been cut with a cheese-knife. It was finally broken by a\r\n_Derrick_ writer, who was a newspaper man and not easily taken down,\r\nextending an invitation to the crowd to drink to the health of Eli\r\nPerkins’s and Joe Mulhatten’s greatest rival.\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Meyers, whom every man and woman at Bradford knew and\r\nadmired, handled tons of explosives and shot hundreds of wells. He had\r\nescapes that would stand a porcupine’s quills on end. To head off a lot\r\nof fellows who asked him for the thousandth time concerning one notable\r\nadventure, he concocted a new version of the affair. “It was a close\r\ncall,” he said, “and no mistake. In the magazine I got some glycerine on\r\nmy boots. Soon after coming out I stamped my heel on a stone and the\r\nfirst thing I knew I was sailing heavenward. When I alighted I struck\r\nsquarely on my other heel and began a second ascension. Somehow I came\r\ndown without much injury, except a bruised feeling that wore off in a\r\nweek or two. You see the glycerine stuck to my boot-heels and when it\r\nhit a hard substance it went off quicker than Old Nick could singe a\r\nkiln-dried sinner. What’ll you take, boys?”\r\n\r\nSo the darkest chapter in petroleum history, a flood of litigation, a\r\nmass of deception, a black wave of treachery and a red streak of human\r\nblood, must be charged to the account of Nitro-Glycerine.\r\n\r\n                         GRAINS OF THIRD SAND.\r\n\r\nMany expressions coined in or about the oil-regions condense a page into\r\na line.

ROCKEFELLER.]\r\n\r\nCompared with a petroleum-sketch which did not touch upon the Standard\r\nOil-Company, in different respects the greatest corporation the world\r\nhas ever known, Hamlet with “the melancholy Dane” left out would be a\r\nmasterpiece of completeness. Perhaps no business-organization in this or\r\nany other country has been more misrepresented and misunderstood. To\r\nmany well-meaning persons, who would not willfully harbor an unjust\r\nthought, it has suggested all that is vicious, grasping and oppressive\r\nin commercial affairs. They picture it as a cruel monster, wearing horns\r\nand cloven-hoofs and a forked-tail, grown rich and fat devouring the\r\nweak and the innocent. Its motives have been impugned, its methods\r\ncondemned and its actions traduced. If a man in Oildom drilled a\r\ndry-hole, backed the wrong horse, lost at poker, dropped money\r\nspeculating, stubbed his toe, ran an unprofitable refinery, missed a\r\ntrain or couldn’t maintain champagne-style on a lager-beer income, it\r\nwas the fashion for him to pose as the victim of a gang of conspirators\r\nand curse the Standard as vigorously and vociferously as the fish-wife\r\nhurled invectives at Daniel O’Connell.\r\n\r\n               Some folks display most wonderful agility\r\n               In their attempts to shift responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for this are as numerous as the sands of the sea. It is no\r\nnew thing to shove upon other shoulders the burden that belongs properly\r\nto our own. In their fiery zeal to convict somebody people have been\r\nknown to bark up the wrong tree, to charge the innocent with all sorts\r\nof offences and to get off their base entirely. Such people and such\r\nmethods did not die out with the passing of the Salem witch-burners. The\r\nStandard was made the scape-goat of the evil deeds alleged to have been\r\ncontemplated by the unsavory South-Improvement Company. That odious\r\ncombine, which included a number of railroad-officials, oil-operators\r\nand refiners, disbanded without producing, refining, buying, selling or\r\ntransporting a gallon of petroleum. “Politics makes strange bedfellows”\r\nand so does business. Among subscribers for South-Improvement stock were\r\ncertain holders of Standard stock and also their bitterest opponents;\r\namong those most active in giving the job its death-blow were prominent\r\nmembers of the Standard Oil-Company. The projected spoliation died\r\n“unwept, unhonored and unsung,” but it was not a Standard scheme.\r\n\r\nEnvy is frequently the penalty of success. Whoever fails in any pursuit\r\nlikes to blame somebody else for his misfortune. This trick is as old as\r\nthe race. Adam started it in Eden, Eve tried to ring in the serpent and\r\ntheir posterity take good care not to let the game get rusty from\r\ndisuse! Its aggregation of capital renders the Standard, in the opinion\r\nof those who have “fallen outside the breastworks,” directly responsible\r\nfor their inability to keep up with the procession. Sympathizers with\r\nthem deem this “confirmation strong as proof of Holy Writ” that the\r\nStandard is an unconscionable monopoly, fostered by crushing out\r\ncompetition. Such reasoning forgets that enterprise, energy, experience\r\nand capital are usually trump-cards. It forgets that “the race is to the\r\nswift,” the battle is to the mighty and that “Heaven is on the side with\r\nthe heaviest artillery.” Carried to its logical conclusion, it means\r\nthat improved methods, labor-saving appliances and new processes count\r\nfor nothing. It means that the snail can travel with the antelope, that\r\nthe locomotive must wait for the stage-coach, that the fittest shall not\r\nsurvive. In short, it is the double-distilled essence of absurdity.\r\n\r\nAny advance in methods of business necessarily injures the poorest\r\ncompetitor. Is this a reason why advances should be held back? If so,\r\nthe public could derive no benefit from competition. The fact that a man\r\nwith meagre resources labors under a serious disadvantage is not an\r\nexcuse for preventing stronger parties from entering the field. The\r\ngrand mistake is in confounding combination with monopoly. By\r\ncombination small capital can compete successfully with large capital.\r\nEvery partnership or corporation is a combination, without which\r\nundertakings beyond individual reach would never be accomplished. Trunk\r\nrailroads would not be built, unity of action would be destroyed,\r\nmankind would segregate as savages and the trade of the world would\r\nstagnate. Combinations should be regulated, not abolished. Rightful\r\ncompetition is not a fierce strife between persons to undersell each\r\nother, that the one enduring the longest may afterwards sell higher, but\r\nthat which furnishes the public with the best products at the least\r\ncost. This is not done by selling below cost, but by diminishing in\r\nevery way possible the cost of producing, manufacturing and\r\ntransporting. The competition which does this, be it by an individual, a\r\nfirm, a corporation, a trust or a combination, is a public benefactor.\r\nThis kind of competition uses the best tools, discards the sickle for\r\nthe cradle and the cradle for the reaper, abandons the flail for the\r\nthreshing-machine and adopts the newest ideas wherever and whenever\r\nexpenses can be lessened. To this end unrestricted combination and\r\nunrestricted competition must go hand-in-hand. A small profit on a large\r\nvolume of business is better for the consumer than a large profit on a\r\nsmall business. The man who sells a million dollars’ worth of goods a\r\nyear, at a profit of five per cent., will become rich, while he who\r\nsells only ten-thousand dollars’ worth can get a bare living. If the\r\nbuilder of a business of one-hundred-thousand dollars deserve praise,\r\nwhy should the builder of a business of millions be censured? Business\r\nthat grows greater than people’s limited notions should not for that\r\ncause be fettered or suppressed. When business ceases to be local and\r\nhas the world for its market, capital must be supplied to meet the\r\nincreasing demand and combination is as essential as fresh air. Thus\r\nlarge establishments take the place of small ones and men acting in\r\nconcert achieve what they would never attempt separately. The more\r\nperfect the power of association the greater the power of production and\r\nthe larger the proportion of the product which falls to the laborer’s\r\nshare. The magnitude of combinations must correspond with the magnitude\r\nof the business to be done, in order to secure the highest skill, to\r\nemploy the latest devices, to pay the best wages, to invent new\r\nappliances, to improve facilities and to give the public a cheaper and\r\nfiner product. This is as natural and legitimate as for water to run\r\ndown hill or the fleet greyhound to distance the slow tortoise.\r\n\r\nHow has the Standard affected the consumer of petroleum-products? What\r\nhas it done for the people who use illuminating oils? Has it advanced\r\nthe price and impaired the quality? The early distillations of petroleum\r\nwere unsatisfactory and often dangerous. The first refineries were\r\nexceedingly primitive and their processes simple. Much of the crude was\r\nwasted in refining, a business not financially successful as a rule\r\nuntil 1872, notwithstanding the high prices obtained. Methods of\r\nmanufacture and transportation were expensive and inadequate. The\r\nproduct was of poor quality, emitting smoke and unpleasant odor and\r\nliable to explode on the slightest provocation. In 1870 a few persons,\r\nwho had previously been partners in a refinery at Cleveland, organized\r\nthe Standard Oil-Company of Ohio, with a capital of one-million dollars,\r\nincreased subsequently to three-and-a-half millions. For years the\r\nhistory of refining had been mainly one of disaster and bankruptcy. A\r\nStandard Oil-Company had been organized at Pittsburg by other persons\r\nand was doing a large trade. The Cleveland Standard Refinery, the\r\nPittsburg Standard Refinery, the Atlantic Refining Company of\r\nPhiladelphia and Charles Pratt & Co. of New York were extensive\r\nconcerns. Because of the hazardous nature and peculiar conditions of the\r\nrefining industry, the need of improved methods and the manifold\r\nadvantages of combination, they entered into an alliance for their\r\nmutual benefit. Refineries in the oil-regions had combined before, hence\r\nthe association of these interests was not a novelty. The cost of\r\ntransportation and packages had been important factors in crippling the\r\nindustry. Crude was barreled at the wells and hauled in wagons to the\r\nrailroads prior to the system of transporting it by pipes laid under\r\nground. Railroad-rates were excessive and irregular. Refiners who\r\ncombined and could throw a large volume of business to any particular\r\nroad secured favorable rates. The rebate-system was universal, not\r\nconfined to oil alone, and possibly this fact had much to do with the\r\ncombination of refiners afterwards known as the Standard Oil-Company.\r\n\r\nVery naturally the Standard endeavored to secure the lowest\r\ntransportation-rates. Quite as naturally railroad-managers, in their\r\neagerness to secure the traffic, vied with each other in offering\r\ninducements to large shippers of petroleum. The Standard furnished,\r\nloaded and unloaded its own tank-cars, thereby eliminating barrels and\r\nmaterially cheapening the freight-service. This reduction of expense\r\nreduced the price of refined in the east to a figure which greatly\r\nincreased the demand and gave oil-operations a healthy stimulus. Still\r\nmore important was the introduction of improvements in refining, which\r\nyielded a larger percentage of illuminating-oil and converted the\r\nresidue into merchantable products. Chemical and mechanical experts,\r\nemployed by the combined companies to conduct experiments in this\r\ndirection, aided in devising processes which revolutionized refining.\r\nThe highest quality of burning-oil was obtained and nearly every\r\nparticle of crude was utilized. Substances of commercial value took the\r\nplace of the waste that formerly emptied into the streams, polluting the\r\nwaters and the atmosphere. In this way the cost was so lessened that\r\nkerosene became the light of the nations. Consumers, whose dime now will\r\nbuy as much as a dollar would before the “octopus” was heard of, are\r\ncorrespondingly happy.\r\n\r\nSince consumers have fared so well, how about refiners outside the\r\nStandard? That smaller concerns were unable to compete with the Standard\r\nunder such circumstances was no reason why the public should be deprived\r\nof the advantages resulting from concentration of capital and effort.\r\nMany of these, realizing that small capital is restricted to poor\r\nmethods and dear production, either sold to the Standard or entered the\r\ncombination. In not a few cases wide-awake refiners took stock for part\r\nof the price of their properties and engaged with the company, adding\r\ntheir talents and experience to the common fund for the benefit of all\r\nconcerned. Others, not strong enough to have their cars and provide all\r\nthe latest improvements, made such changes as they could afford to meet\r\nthe requirements of the local trade, letting the larger ones attend to\r\ndistant markets. Some continued right along and they are still on deck\r\nas independent refiners, always a respectable factor in the trade and\r\nnever more active than to-day. Those who would neither improve, nor\r\nsell, nor combine, sitting down placidly and believing they would be\r\nbought out later on their own terms, were soon left far behind, as they\r\ndeserved to be. Let it be said positively that the Standard, in\r\nnegotiating for the purchase or combination of refineries, treated the\r\nowners liberally and sought to keep the best men in the business. A\r\nnumber who put up works to sell at exorbitant prices, failing in their\r\ndesign, howled about “monopoly” and “freezing out” and tried to pass as\r\nmartyrs. It is true hundreds of inferior refineries have been\r\ndismantled, not because they were frozen out by a crushing monopoly, but\r\nbecause they lacked requisite facilities. The refineries in vogue when\r\nthe Standard was organized could not stay in business a week, if\r\nresurrected and revived. A team of pack-mules might as well try to\r\ncompete with the New York Central Railroad as these early refineries to\r\nmeet the requirements of the petroleum-trade at its present stage of\r\nperfection. They were “frozen out” just as stage-coaches were “frozen\r\nout” by the iron-horse or the sailing-vessel of our grandfathers’ time\r\nby the ocean-liner that crosses the Atlantic in six days. Every\r\nlabor-saving invention and improvement in machinery throws worthy\r\npersons out of employment, but inventions and improvements do not stop\r\nfor any such cause. Business is a question of profit and convenience,\r\nnot a matter of sentiment. The manufacturer who, by an improved process,\r\ncan save a fraction of a cent on the yard or pound or gallon of his\r\noutput has an enormous advantage. Must he be deprived of it because\r\nother manufacturers cannot produce their wares as cheaply? Refining\r\npetroleum is no exception to the ordinary rule and a transformation in\r\nits methods and results was as inevitable as human progress and the\r\nchanges of the seasons.\r\n\r\nOver-production is justly chargeable with the low price of crude that\r\nwafted many producers into bankruptcy. Regardless of the inexorable laws\r\nof supply and demand, operators drilled in Bradford and Butler until\r\nforty-million barrels were above ground and the price fell to forty\r\ncents. Time and again the wisest producers sought to stem the tide by\r\nstopping the drill, which started with renewed energy after each brief\r\nrespite. With the stocks bearing the market the dropping of crude to a\r\nprice that meant ruin to owners of small wells was as certain as death\r\nand taxes. Gold-dollars would be as cheap as pebbles if they were as\r\nplentiful. Forty-million barrels of diamonds stored in South Africa\r\nwould bring the glistening gems to the level of glass-beads. The\r\nStandard, through the National-Transit Company, erected thousands of\r\ntanks to husband the enormous surplus, which the world could not consume\r\nand would not have on any terms. Hosts of operators were kept out of the\r\nsheriff’s grasp by this provision for their relief, using their\r\ncertificates as collateral during the period of extreme depression. The\r\nrichest districts were drained at length, consumption increased and\r\nproduction declined, stocks were reduced and prices advanced. Then a\r\nnumber of oil-operators, foremost among whom were some of the men whom\r\nthe Standard had carried over the grave crisis, thought the\r\nNational-Transit was making too much money storing crude and tried to\r\nsecure legislation that was hardly a shade removed from confiscation.\r\nThe legislature refused to pass the bills, the company voluntarily\r\nreduced its charges and the agitation subsided. Thousands of producers\r\nsold or entered large companies, into whose hands a good share of the\r\ndevelopment has fallen, mainly because of the great expense of operating\r\nin deep territory and the wisdom of dividing the risk attendant upon\r\nseeking new fields. Operators who had to retire were “frozen out” by\r\nexcessive drilling, nothing more and nothing less!\r\n\r\nThe highest efficiency in all fields of economical endeavor is obtained\r\nby the greatest degree of organization and specialization of effort. To\r\nattack large concerns as monopolies, simply because they represent\r\nmillions of dollars under a single management, is as stupid and unjust\r\nas the narrow antagonism of ill-balanced capitalists to organized labor.\r\nIf organized capital means better methods, greater facilities and\r\nimproved processes, organized labor means better wages, greater\r\nrecognition and improved industrial conditions. Hence both deserve to be\r\nencouraged and both should work in harmony. The Standard Oil-Company\r\nestablished agencies in different states for the sale of its products.\r\nAs the business grew it organized corporations under the laws of these\r\nstates, to carry on the industry under corporate agencies. Manufactories\r\nwere located at the seaboard for the export-trade. It was easier and\r\ncheaper to pipe crude to the coast than to refine it at the sources of\r\nsupply and ship the varied products. Thus the refining of export-oil was\r\ndone at the seaboard, just as iron is manufactured at Pittsburg instead\r\nof at the ore-beds on Lake Superior. The company aimed to open markets\r\nfor petroleum by reducing the cost of its transportation and manufacture\r\nand bettering its quality. It manufactured its own barrels, cans,\r\npaints, acids, glue and other materials, effecting a vast saving. On\r\nJanuary second, 1882, the forty persons then associated in the Standard\r\nowned the entire capital of fifteen corporations and a part of the stock\r\nof a number of others. Nine of these forty controlled a majority of the\r\nstocks so held, and it was agreed on that date that all the stocks of\r\nthe corporations should be placed in the hands of these nine as\r\ntrustees. The trustees issued certificates showing the extent of each\r\nblock of stock so surrendered, and agreed to conduct the business of the\r\nseveral corporations for the best interests of all concerned. This was\r\nthe inception of the Standard Oil-Trust, the most abused and least\r\nunderstood business-organization in the history of the race.\r\n\r\nThe Standard Trust, which demagogues lay awake nights coining language\r\nto denounce, did not unite competing corporations. The corporations were\r\ncontributory agencies to the same business, the stock owned by the\r\nindividuals who had built up and carried on the business and held the\r\nvoting power. These individuals had combined not to repress business,\r\nbut to extend it legitimately, by allying various branches and various\r\ncorporations. The organization of the Trust was designed to facilitate\r\nthe business of these corporations by uniting them under the management\r\nof one Board of Trustees. This object was business-like and laudable. It\r\nhad no taint of a scheme to “corner” a necessity of life and elevate the\r\nprice at the expense of the masses. On the contrary, it was calculated\r\nto enlarge the demand and supply it at the minimum of profit. For ten\r\nyears the Standard Trust continued in existence, dissolving finally in\r\n1892. During this term its stockholders increased from forty to two\r\nthousand. Many of the most skillful refiners and experienced producers\r\njoined the combination and were retained to manage their properties.\r\nEach corporation was managed as though independent of every other in the\r\nTrust, except that the rivalry to show the best record stimulated them\r\nto constant improvement. Whatever economy one devised was adopted by\r\nall. The business was most systematic and admirably managed in every\r\ndetail, running as harmoniously as the different parts of a watch.\r\nClerks, agents and employés who could save a few hundred dollars\r\npurchased Trust Certificates and thus became interested in the business\r\nand gains. If it is desirable to multiply the number who enjoy the\r\nprofits of production, how can it be done better than through ownership\r\nof stock in industrial associations? The problem of co-operation and\r\nprofit-sharing can be solved in this way. The Standard Trust was a real\r\nobject-lesson in economics, which illustrated in the fullest measure the\r\nbenefits of an association in business that affected consumers and\r\nproducers of a great staple alike favorably.\r\n\r\nMisrepresentation is as hard to eradicate as the Canada thistle or the\r\nEnglish sparrow. Once fairly set going, it travels rapidly. “A lie will\r\ntravel seven leagues while Truth is pulling on its boots.” The Standard\r\nis the target at which invidious terms and bitter invective have been\r\nhurled remorselessly, often through downright ignorance. Although\r\nreputable editors might be misled, in the hurry and strain of daily\r\njournalism, to give currency to deliberate falsehoods against\r\ncorporations or capitalists, reasonable fairness might be expected from\r\nthe author of a pretentious book. Henry D. Lloyd, of Chicago, last year\r\npublished “Wealth Against Commonwealth,” an elaborate work, which is\r\ndevoted mainly to an assault upon the Standard Oil-Company. The book,\r\nnotable for its distortion of facts and suppression of all points in\r\nfavor of the corporation it assails, caters to the worst elements of\r\nsocialism. The author views everything through anti-combination glasses\r\nand, like the child with the bogie-man, sees the monopoly-spook in every\r\nsuccessful aggregation of capital. He confounds the South-Improvement\r\nCompany with the Standard and charges to the latter all the offenses\r\nsupposed to lie at the door of the organization that died at its birth.\r\nOne thrilling story is cited to show that the Standard robbed a poor\r\nwidow. The narrative is well calculated to arouse public resentment and\r\nencourage a lynching-bee. It has been repeated times without number.\r\nWithin the past month two Harrisburg ministers have referred to it as a\r\nstartling evidence of the unscrupulous tyranny of the Standard\r\nmillionaires. To make the case imposing Mr. Lloyd informs mankind that\r\nthe husband of this widow had been “a prominent member of the\r\nPresbyterian church, president of a Young Men’s Christian Association\r\nand active in all religious and benevolent enterprises.” After his death\r\nshe continued the business until she was finally coerced into selling it\r\nto the Trust at a ruinously low price—a mere fraction of its actual\r\nvalue. Mr. Lloyd states her hopeless despair as follows:\r\n\r\n“Indignant with these thoughts and the massacred troop of hopes and\r\nambitions that her brave heart had given birth to, she threw the\r\nletter—a letter she had received from the Standard regarding the sale of\r\nher property—into the fire, where it curled up into flames like those\r\nfrom which a Dives once begged for a drop of water. She never reappeared\r\nin the world of business, where she had found no chivalry to help a\r\nwoman save her home, her husband’s life-work and her children.”\r\n\r\nIs this harrowing statement true? The widow continued the business four\r\nyears after her husband’s death. Competition increased, prices tumbled,\r\nthe margin of profit was constantly narrowing, new appliances simplified\r\nrefining-processes and the widow’s plant was no longer adapted to the\r\nbusiness. She sold for sixty-thousand dollars, the Standard paying twice\r\nthe sum for which a refinery better suited to the purpose could be\r\nconstructed. Foolish friends afterwards told her she had sold too low\r\nand the widow wrote a severe letter to the president of the Standard.\r\nThe company had bought the property to oblige her and at once offered it\r\nback. She declined to take it, or sixty-thousand dollars in Standard\r\nstock, evidently realizing that the refinery had lost its profit-earning\r\ncapacity and that even the new management might not be able to make it\r\npay. This will serve to illustrate the unfairness of “Wealth Against\r\nCommonwealth,” which has been widely quoted because of its presumed\r\nreliability and the high standing of the publishers. Yet this story of\r\nimaginary wrong has been worked into speeches, sermons and editorials of\r\nthe fiercest type! In its treatment of the widow the Standard was truly\r\nmagnanimous. Few business-men would consent to undo a transaction and\r\nhave their labor for naught, simply because the other party had become\r\ndissatisfied. Possibly Mr. Lloyd would not be as generous if there was\r\nany profit in the transaction. If the Standard cut prices to ruin the\r\nwidow and other competitors, would not oil have gone up again when they\r\nwere disposed of? No such upward movement occurred. The widow\r\ndisappeared. Many small refineries disappeared. Monopoly\r\nrailroad-contracts, if such ever existed, have disappeared, but the\r\nprice of refined-oil has been falling steadily for twenty years,\r\ndeclining from an average of nineteen cents a gallon in 1876 to five\r\ncents in 1895. The potent fact in this connection is that the Standard\r\nhas continued to make profits with the declining price of oil. This\r\nconclusively demonstrates that the decline was due to economic\r\nimprovements in the productive methods and not to a malicious cut to\r\nruin a widow or anybody else, as Mr. Lloyd assumes. Otherwise a profit\r\naccompanying the fall in price would have been impossible and the\r\nStandard would have been sold out by the sheriff long years ago.\r\n\r\nAll the dealers in slander from Lloyd down to the chronic kicker who has\r\nattempted to make money by annoying the Standard have played the Rice\r\ncase as a trump-card. According to their version, Mr. Rice was an\r\nangelic Vermonter, whose success inspired the Standard with devilish\r\nenmity and it determined to compass his ruin. Rice had operated at\r\nPithole and at Macksburg and owned a small refinery at Marietta. It was\r\nalleged that the Cleveland & Marietta Railroad discriminated against\r\nhim, doubling his freight-charge and giving the Standard a drawback on\r\nall the oil that went over the road. This was an iniquitous arrangement,\r\nentered into by the receiver of the road and cancelled by the Standard\r\nwhenever a report of what was done reached New York. Mr. Rice had paid\r\ntwo-hundred-and-fifty dollars wrongfully, the money was at once refunded\r\nand Mr. Rice did not harass the company into buying his twenty-thousand\r\ndollar refinery for half a million. This will serve as an example of the\r\ndishonest misstatements that had wrought lots of good people up to white\r\nheat. The sins of the trusts may be very scarlet and very numerous, but\r\neconomic literature should not pollute the sources of information and\r\nthe foundations of public opinion.\r\n\r\nAn oft-repeated story is that the Standard owes its success to\r\nrailway-discriminations. In proof of this the testimony of A. J.\r\nCassatt is quoted. The testimony, published in a congressional\r\ninvestigation-report, shows that granting rebates was then the custom\r\nof railway-companies. Largely the same rebates were granted to all who\r\nshipped over the railways. Special to the Standard was payment of a\r\njoint freight-rate over pipe-line and railroad. A large rebate was\r\ngiven for one summer to all shippers by rail to equalize low rates by\r\ncanal, of which many shippers took advantage. The only discriminatory\r\nrebate received by the Standard was ten per cent. for equalizing its\r\nlarge shipments over three trunk-lines, shipping exclusively by rail,\r\neven when water-rates were cheaper, furnishing terminal facilities and\r\nexempting the roads from loss by fire or accident. Courts in England\r\nand this country have very properly held that railways have the right\r\nto carry for less rates under such circumstances. Many wise men are of\r\nthe same opinion. Subsequently it was developed that, while the\r\nshort-lived agreement existed, the Standard’s strongest competitors\r\nwere getting lower rates of freight than it was paying! Why do the\r\nLloyd brand of critics ignore this pointed fact?\r\n\r\nAnother favorite story is that some officers of the Standard were\r\nconvicted of burning a rival refinery. As all know who ever took the\r\ntrouble to investigate, they were indicted for conspiracy to injure a\r\nrival. The counts in the indictment embraced the enticing away of an\r\nemployé, the bringing of suits to prevent infringement of patents and\r\nthe serious charge of inciting an employé to burn the works. When all\r\nthe evidence on the part of the State was in, the court directed the\r\ndischarge of every person connected with the Standard. There was not a\r\nscintilla of evidence against them. Two of the indicted persons were\r\nconvicted of conspiracy, but they were not connected with the Standard,\r\nand never owned a share of Standard stock. The majority of the jurymen\r\nmade affidavits that they found the convicted persons guilty only of\r\nenticing away an employé. The employé thus enticed had first been\r\nenticed from the works of the convicted parties and induced to reveal\r\nthe secret processes by which a valuable lubricating-oil was\r\nmanufactured. The best citizens of Rochester certified that the men\r\nconvicted were men of unimpeachable honor, while the men who testified\r\nagainst them were quite the reverse. The whole affair was a wicked plot\r\nto blacken the character of men who stood and who still stand as high as\r\nany in Rochester. The court, satisfied of their innocence of any grave\r\noffence, inflicted merely a nominal fine.\r\n\r\nMany of the attacks in a well-known work by a leading socialist against\r\nthe Standard are made up of court-cases. The accusations are copied, the\r\nmoving speeches of plaintiffs’ attorneys are printed; but all else is\r\nomitted, except that the case was decided in favor of the Standard. The\r\ninference is left to be drawn, or the charge is made openly, that the\r\ncourt was corrupt. Had the evidence of both sides been given, there\r\nwould be no more room for such an inference than for a pretty maiden’s\r\nsmall brother in the parlor when her best young man is about to pop the\r\nmomentous question. The rustic divine, weak in his spelling and strong\r\nin his opposition to the feminine style of coiling the hair in a huge\r\nknot, had better grounds for declaring the Scripture endorsed his view\r\nof the fashion. Reading the familiar passage, “let him that is on the\r\nhousetop not come down to take anything out of his house,” he based his\r\nterrific sermon on this dismembered clause of the verse: “Top not, come\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\nOne instance may be noted briefly. A Pennsylvania office-holder, whose\r\nunworthy motives an investigation exposed, charged that the Standard had\r\ndefrauded the State of millions of taxes. The case was ably tried before\r\nan upright judge and the allegation found to be utterly baseless. Then\r\nthe judge was charged with corruption. The case was taken to the highest\r\ncourt of the State, which affirmed the decision of the court below. At\r\nonce the Supreme Court and the Attorney-General, who conducted the case\r\nfor the State with signal ability, were accused of rank corruption.\r\nPerhaps the greatest surprise is that they were not charged with an\r\nattempt to get even with Moses by breaking all the commandments at one\r\nlick. An investigation committee, appointed by the Legislature, went\r\nfully into all the facts and allegations and reported that the case had\r\nbeen ably and fairly tried and correctly decided. It only remained to\r\ncharge the legislative committee with corruption, which was done with\r\ngreat promptitude and emphasis. Yet every lawyer knows that the case of\r\nPennsylvania against the Standard Oil-Company is a leading case on the\r\nsubject of taxation of foreign corporations, establishing correct\r\nprinciples which, since its decision, the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates has affirmed.\r\n\r\nIn another case a respectable old man conceived the idea that he had\r\nsolved the problem of continuous distillation of oil, an invention which\r\nwould very much cheapen the product and be worth millions to refiners.\r\nThe Standard aided him in his experiments until convinced they were\r\nunsuccessful. He became crazed on the subject and brought suit, alleging\r\nhe had been prevented from demonstrating his discovery. The case was\r\ntried and the baseless suit dismissed, with as little injury to the poor\r\nman’s feelings as possible. This incident figures in histories written\r\nto fire the popular heart in the war against wealth, accompanied by\r\npictures of a soulless corporation and an insane old man, calculated to\r\ndraw hot tears and inflame public indignation to a dangerous pitch. Of\r\ncourse the readers are supposed to infer that the court was corrupted\r\nand justice grossly outraged. And so the changes are rung along the\r\nwhole line; but the Standard, regardless of malevolent assaults and\r\nvillainous distortions of facts, goes right on with its business of\r\nfurnishing the world with the best light in the universe.\r\n\r\nRussian competition, the extent and danger of which most people do not\r\nbegin to appreciate, was met and overcome by sheer tenacity and superior\r\ngeneralship. The advantages of capable, courageous, intelligent\r\nconcentration of the varied branches of a great industry were never\r\nmanifested more strongly. Deprived of the invincible bulwark the\r\nStandard offered, the oil-producers of Pennsylvania, New York, West\r\nVirginia, Ohio and Indiana would have been utterly helpless. The\r\nMuscovite bear would have gobbled the trade of Europe and Asia, driving\r\nAmerican oil from the foreign markets. Local consumption would not have\r\nexhausted two-thirds of the production, stocks of crude would have piled\r\nup and the price would have fallen proportionately. Instead of ranking\r\nwith the busiest, happiest and most prosperous quarters of the universe,\r\nas they are to-day, the oil-regions of five states would have been\r\nirretrievably ruined, dragging down thousands of the brightest,\r\nmanliest, cleverest fellows on God’s footstool! Instead of bringing a\r\nvast amount of gold from England, France and Germany for petroleum\r\nproduced on American soil, refined by American workmen paid American\r\nwages and exported by an American company in American vessels, the trade\r\nwould have been killed, the cash would have stayed across the waters and\r\nthe country at large would have suffered incalculably! These are things\r\nto think of when some cheap agitator, with a private axe to grind, a\r\nmean spite to gratify or a selfish object to attain, raises a howl about\r\nmonopoly and insists that the entire creation should “damn the\r\nStandard!”\r\n\r\nWhen the history of this wonderful century is written it will tell how\r\nan American boy, born in New York sixty years ago, clerked in a\r\ncountry-store, kept a set of books, started a small oil-refinery at\r\nCleveland and at forty was the head of the greatest business in the\r\nworld. This is, in outline, the story of John D. Rockefeller’s\r\nsuccessful career. Yesterday, as it were, a youth with nothing but\r\nintegrity, industry and ambition for capital—a pretty good outfit,\r\ntoo—to-day he is one of the half-dozen richest men in Europe or America.\r\nBetter than all else, integrity that is part and parcel of his moral\r\nnature, industry that finds life too fruitful to waste it idly and\r\nambition to excel in good deeds as well as in business are his rich\r\npossession still. Gathering the largest fortune ever accumulated in\r\ntwenty-five years has not blunted his fine sensibilities, dwarfed his\r\nintellectual growth, stifled his religious convictions or absorbed his\r\nwhole being. Increasing wealth brought with it a deep sense of\r\nincreasing responsibility and he is honored not so much for his millions\r\nas for the use he makes of them. Even in an age unrivalled for\r\nmoney-getting and money-giving, Mr. Rockefeller’s keen foresight,\r\nexecutive ability and wise liberality have been notably conspicuous. His\r\nfaith in the future of petroleum and his desire to benefit humanity he\r\nhas shown by his works. Believing in the power of united effort to\r\ndevelop an infant-industry, his genius devised the system of practical\r\nco-operation that developed into the Standard Oil-Trust, against which\r\nprejudice and ignorance have directed their fiercest fire. Believing in\r\neducation, his magnificent endowment of Chicago University—eight to\r\nten-million dollars—ranks him with the foremost contributors to the\r\nfoundation of a seat of learning since schools and colleges began.\r\nBelieving in fresh air for the masses, he donated Cleveland a public\r\npark and a million to equip it superbly. Believing in spiritual\r\nprogress, he builds churches, helps weak congregations and aids in\r\nspreading the gospel everywhere. Believing in the claims of the poor,\r\nhis charities amount to hundreds-of-thousands of dollars yearly, not to\r\nencourage pauperism and dependence, but to relieve genuine distress,\r\ndiminish human suffering and put struggling men and women in the way to\r\nimprove their condition. He has differed from nearly all other eminent\r\npublic benefactors by giving freely, quietly and modestly during his\r\nactive life, without seeking the popular applause his munificence could\r\neasily obtain.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller is a strict Baptist, a regular attendant at church and\r\nprayer-meeting, a teacher in the Sunday-school and a staunch advocate of\r\naggressive Christianity. His advancement to commanding wealth has not\r\nchanged his ideas of duty and personal obligation. He realizes that the\r\nman who lives for himself alone is always little, no matter how big his\r\nbank-account. He and his family walk to service or ride in a street-car,\r\nwith none of the trappings befitting the worship of Mammon rather than\r\nthe glory of God. Earnest, positive and vigorous in his religion as in\r\nhis business, he takes no stock in the dealer who has not stamina or the\r\nprofession of faith that is too destitute of backbone to have a\r\ndenominational preference. The president of the Standard Oil-Company\r\nimpresses all who meet him with the idea of a forceful, decisive\r\ncharacter. He looks people in the face, his eyes sparkle in conversation\r\nand he relishes a bright story or a clever narration. You feel that he\r\ncan read you at a glance and that deception and evasion in his presence\r\nwould be utterly futile. The flatterer and sycophant would make as\r\nlittle headway with him as the bunco-steerer or the green-goods vendor.\r\nHis estimate of men is rarely at fault and to this quality some measure\r\nof the Standard’s success must be attributed. As if by instinct, its\r\nchief officer picked out men adapted to special lines of work—men who\r\nwould not be misfits—and secured them for his company. The capacity and\r\nfidelity of the Standard corps are proverbial. Whenever Mr. Rockefeller\r\nwishes to enjoy a breathing-spell at his country-seat up the Hudson or\r\non his Ohio farm, he leaves the business with perfect confidence,\r\nbecause his lieutenants are competent and trustworthy and the machine\r\nwill run along smoothly under their watchful care. He has not\r\naccumulated his money by wrecking property, but by building up, by\r\npersistent improvement and by rigidly adhering to the policy of\r\nfurnishing the best articles at the lowest price. Fair-minded people are\r\nbeginning to understand something of the service rendered the public by\r\nthe man who stands at the head of the petroleum-industry and more than\r\nany other is the founder of its commerce. He has invested in factories,\r\nrailroads and mines, giving thousands employment, developing the\r\nresources of the country and adding to the wealth of the nation. He is\r\nhuman, therefore he sometimes errs; he is fallible, therefore he makes\r\nmistakes, but the world is learning that John D. Rockefeller has no\r\nsuperior in business and that the Standard Oil-Company is not an\r\norganized conspiracy to plunder producers or consumers of petroleum. It\r\nis time to dismiss the idea that ability to build up and maintain a\r\nlarge business is discreditable, that marvellous success is blameworthy\r\nand that business-achievements imply dishonesty.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rockefeller, who resembles his brother in business skill, is a\r\nleader in Standard affairs and has his office in the Broadway building.\r\nHe was a member of the first Board of Trustees and bore a prominent part\r\nin organizing and developing the Oil-Trust. He is largely interested in\r\nrailroads, belongs to the best clubs, likes good horses and contributes\r\nliberally to worthy objects. The Standard folks don’t lock up their\r\nmoney, loan it on mortgages at extravagant rates, spend it in Europe or\r\ntry to get a gold squeeze on the government. They employ it in\r\nmanufactures, in railways, in commerce and in enterprises that promote\r\nthe general welfare.\r\n\r\nFrom the days of the little refinery in Cleveland, the germ of the\r\nStandard, Henry M. Flagler and John D. Rockefeller have been closely\r\nassociated in oil. Samuel Andrews, a practical refiner and for some time\r\ntheir partner, retired from the firm with a million dollars as his share\r\nof the business. The organization of the Standard Oil-Company of\r\nCleveland was the first step towards the greater Standard Oil-Company of\r\nwhich all the world knows something. Its growth surprised even the\r\nprojectors of the combination, who “builded better than they knew.” Mr.\r\nFlagler devotes his time largely to beneficent uses of his great wealth.\r\nHe recognizes the duty of the possessor of property to keep it from\r\nwaste, to render it productive and to increase it by proper methods. A\r\nvast tract of Florida swamp, yielding only malaria and shakes, he has\r\nconverted into a region suited to human-beings, producing cotton, sugar\r\nand tropical fruits and affording comfortable subsistence to thousands\r\nof provident settlers. He has transformed St. Augustine from a faded\r\nantiquity into a modern town, with the magnificent Ponce de Leon Hotel,\r\npaved streets, elegant churches, public halls, and all conveniences,\r\nprovided by this generous benefactor at a cost of many millions. He has\r\nconstructed new railroads, improved lines built previously, opened\r\ninterior counties to thrifty emigrants and performed a work of\r\nincalculable advantage to the New South. He and his family attend the\r\nWest Presbyterian Church, of which the Rev. John R. Paxton, formerly of\r\nHarrisburg, was pastor until 1894. Mr. Flagler is of average height,\r\nslight build and erect figure. His hair is white, but time has not dealt\r\nharshly with the liberal citizen whose career presents so much to praise\r\nand emulate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN D. ARCHBOLD.]\r\n\r\nJohn D. Archbold, vice-president of the Standard Oil-Company and its\r\nyoungest trustee during the entire existence of the Oil-Trust, has been\r\nactively connected with petroleum from his youth. No man is better known\r\nand better liked personally in the oil-regions. From his father, a\r\nzealous Methodist minister, and his good mother, one of the noble women\r\nto whom this country owes an infinite debt of gratitude, he inherited\r\nthe qualities of head and heart that achieved success and gained\r\nmultitudes of friends. A mere lad when the reports of golden\r\nopportunities attracted him from Ohio to the land of petroleum, he first\r\nengaged as a shipping-clerk for a Titusville refinery. His promptness,\r\naccuracy, and pleasant address won him favor and promotion. He soon\r\nlearned the whole art of refining and his active mind discovered\r\nremedies for a number of defects. Adnah Neyhart induced him to take\r\ncharge of his warehouse in New York City for the sale of refined-oil.\r\nHis energy and rare tact increased the trade of the establishment\r\nsteadily. Mr. Rockefeller met the bright young man and offered him a\r\nresponsible position with the Standard. He was made president of the\r\nAcme Refining Company, then among the largest in the United States. He\r\nimproved the quality of its products and was entrusted with the\r\nnegotiations that brought many refiners into the combination. He had\r\nresided at Titusville, where he married the daughter of Major Mills, and\r\nwas the principal representative of the Standard in the producing\r\nsection. When the Trust was organized he removed to New York and\r\nsupervised especially the refining-interest of the united corporations.\r\nHis splendid executive talent, keen perception, tireless energy and\r\nhonorable manliness were simply invaluable. Mr. Archbold is popular in\r\nsociety, has an ideal home, represents the Standard in the directory of\r\ndifferent companies and merits the high esteem ungrudingly bestowed by\r\nhis associates in business and his acquaintances everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES PRATT.]\r\n\r\nThe personal traits and business-successes of Charles Pratt, an original\r\nmember of the Standard Trust, were typical of American civilization. The\r\nson of poor parents in Massachusetts, where he was born in 1830,\r\nnecessity compelled him to leave home at the early age of ten and seek\r\nwork on a farm. He toiled three years for his board and a short term at\r\nschool each winter. For his board and clothes he next worked in a Boston\r\ngrocery. His first dollar in money, of which he always spoke with pride\r\nas having been made at the work-bench, he earned while learning the\r\nmachinist-trade at Newton, in his native state. With the savings of his\r\nfirst year in the machine-shop he entered an academy, studying\r\ndiligently twelve months and subsisting on a dollar a week. Then he\r\nentered a Boston paints-and-oil store, devoting his leisure hours to\r\nstudy and self-improvement. Coming to New York in 1851, he clerked in\r\nAppleton’s publishing-house and later in a paint-store. In 1854 he\r\njoined C. T. Reynolds and F. W. Devoe in a paints-and-oil establishment.\r\nPetroleum refining became important and the partners separated in 1867,\r\nReynolds controlling the paints-department and Charles Pratt & Co.\r\nconducting the oil-branch of the business. The success of the latter\r\nfirm as oil-refiners was extraordinary. Astral-oil was in demand\r\neverywhere. The works at Brooklyn, continuous and surprising as was\r\ntheir expansion, found it difficult to keep pace with the consumption.\r\nThe firm entered into the association with the Cleveland, Pittsburg and\r\nPhiladelphia companies that culminated in the Standard Oil-Trust, Mr.\r\nPratt holding the relation of president of the Charles-Pratt\r\nManufacturing Company. He lived in Brooklyn and died suddenly at\r\nsixty-three, an attack of heart-disease that prostrated him in his\r\nNew-York office proving fatal in three hours. For thirty years he\r\ndevoted much of his time to the philanthropies with which his name will\r\nbe perpetually identified. He built and equipped Pratt Institute, a\r\nschool of manual arts, at a cost of two-million dollars. He spent a\r\nhalf-million to erect the Astral Apartment Buildings, the revenue of\r\nwhich is secured to the Institute as part of its endowment. He devoted a\r\nhalf-million to the Adelphia Academy and a quarter-million towards the\r\nnew edifice of Emanuel Baptist Church, of which he was a devout,\r\ngenerous member. His home-life was marked by gentleness and affection\r\nand he left his family an estate of fifteen to twenty-millions. Charles\r\nPratt was a man of few words, alert, positive and unassuming, sometimes\r\nblunt in business, but always courteous, trustworthy and deservedly\r\nesteemed for liberality and energy.\r\n\r\nJabez A. Bostwick, a member of the Standard Trust from its inception,\r\nwas born in New York State, spent his babyhood in Ohio, whither the\r\nfamily moved when he was ten years old, and died at sixty-two. His\r\nbusiness-education began as clerk in a bank at Covington, Ky. There he\r\nfirst came into public notice as a cotton-broker, removing to New York\r\nin 1864 to conduct the same business on a larger scale. He secured\r\ninterests in territory and oil-wells at Franklin in 1860, organized the\r\nfirm of J. A. Bostwick & Co. and engaged extensively in refining. The\r\nfirm prospered, bought immense quantities of crude and increased its\r\nrefining capacity extensively. Mr. Bostwick was active in forming the\r\nStandard Oil-Trust and was its first treasurer. He severed his\r\nconnection with his oil-partner, W. H. Tilford, who also entered the\r\nStandard Oil-Company. Seven years before his death he retired from the\r\noil-business to accept the presidency of the New York & New England\r\nRailroad. He held the position six years and was succeeded by Austin\r\nCorbin. Injuries during a fire at his country-seat in Mamaroneck caused\r\nhis death. The fire started in Frederick A. Constable’s stables, in rear\r\nof Mr. Bostwick’s. Unknown to his coachman, who was pushing behind it,\r\nMr. Bostwick seized the whiffletrees of a carriage. Suddenly the vehicle\r\nswerved and the owner was violently jammed against the side of the\r\nstable. The coachman saw his peril and pulled the carriage back. Mr.\r\nBostwick reeled forward, his face white with pain and sank moaning upon\r\na buckboard. “Don’t leave me, Mr. Williams,” he whispered to his son’s\r\ntutor, “I fear I am badly hurt.” The sufferer was carried to the house,\r\nbecame unconscious and died in ten minutes, surrounded by members of his\r\nhousehold and his neighbors. In 1866 Mr. Bostwick married a daughter of\r\nFord Smith, a retired Cincinnati merchant, who removed to New York\r\nduring the war. They had a son and two daughters. The daughters married\r\nand were in Europe when their father met his tragic fate. The widow and\r\nchildren inherited an estate of twelve millions. Mr. Bostwick was\r\nliberal with his wealth, giving largely without ostentation. Forrest\r\nCollege, in North Carolina, and the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church of New\r\nYork were special recipients of his bounty, while his private\r\nbenefactions amounted to many thousands yearly. He was strict almost to\r\nsternness in his dealings, preferring justice to sentiment in business.\r\n\r\nThese were the six trustees of the Standard Oil-Trust as first\r\nconstituted of whom the world has heard and read most. Many of the\r\ntwo-thousand stock-holders of the Standard Oil-Company are widely known.\r\nBenjamin Brewster, president of the National-Transit Company, retired\r\nwith an ample fortune. His successor, H. H. Rogers, the present head of\r\nthe pipe-line system, is noted alike for business-sagacity and sensible\r\nbenefactions. The great structure at No. 26 Broadway, the largest\r\noffice-building in New York occupied by one concern, is the Standard\r\nheadquarters. Each floor has one or more departments, managed by\r\ncompetent men and all under supervision of the company’s chief\r\nofficials. From the basement, with its massive vaults and steam-heating\r\nplant, to the roof every inch is utilized by hundreds of book-keepers,\r\naccountants, stenographers, telegraphers, clerks and heads of divisions.\r\nEverything moves with the utmost precision and smoothness. President\r\nRockefeller has his private offices on the eighth floor, next the\r\nspacious room in which the Executive Committee meets every day at noon\r\nfor consultation. Mr. Flagler, Mr. Archbold and Mr. Rogers are located\r\nconveniently. The substantial character of the building and the\r\nbusiness-like aspect of the departments impress visitors most favorably.\r\nThere is an utter absence of gingerbread and cheap ornamentation, of\r\nconfusion and perplexing hurry. The very air, the clicking of the\r\ntelegraph-instruments, the noiseless motion of the elevators and the\r\nprompt dispatch of business indicate solidity, intelligence and perfect\r\nsystem. From that building the movements of a force of employés,\r\nnumbering twice the United States army and scattered over both\r\nhemispheres, are directed. The sails of the Standard fleet whiten every\r\nsea, its products are marketed wherever men have learned the value of\r\nartificial light and its name is a universal synonym for the highest\r\ndevelopment of commercial enterprise in any age or country.\r\n\r\nBusiness-men recall with a shudder the frightful stringency in 1893. All\r\nover the land industries drooped and withered and died. Raw material,\r\neven wool itself, had no market. Commerce languished, wages dwindled,\r\nrailroads collapsed, factories suspended, and myriads of workmen lost\r\ntheir jobs. Merchants cut down expenses to the lowest notch, loans were\r\ncalled in at a terrible sacrifice, debts were compromised at ten to\r\nfifty cents on the dollar, the present was dark and the future gloomy.\r\nThe balance of trade was heavily against the United States. Government\r\nsecurities tumbled and a steady drain of gold to Europe set in. The\r\nefforts of Congress, the Treasury Department and syndicates of bankers\r\nto stem the tide of disaster were on a par with Mrs. Partington’s\r\nattempt to sweep back the ocean with a sixpenny-broom. Amid the general\r\ndemoralization, when the nation seemed hastening to positive ruin, one\r\nsplendid enterprise alone extended its business, multiplied its\r\nresources and was largely instrumental in restoring public confidence.\r\n\r\nThe Standard Oil-Company, unrivalled in its equipment of brains and\r\nskill and capital, not merely breasted the storm successfully, but did\r\nmore than all other agencies combined to avert widespread bankruptcy.\r\nThrough the sagacity and foresight of this great corporation crude oil\r\nadvanced fifty per cent., thereby doubling and trebling the prosperity\r\nof the producing sections, without a corresponding rise in refined. By\r\nthis wise policy, which only men of nerve and genius could have carried\r\nout, home consumers were not taxed to benefit the oil-regions and the\r\nexports of petroleum-products swelled enormously. As the result, while\r\nthe American demand increased constantly, millions upon millions of\r\ndollars flowed in from abroad, materially diminishing the European\r\ndrainage of the yellow metal from this side of the Atlantic. The\r\nsalutary, far-reaching effects of such management, by reviving faith and\r\nstimulating the flagging energies of the country, exerted an influence\r\nupon the common welfare words and figures cannot estimate. Petroleum\r\npreserved the thread of golden traffic with foreign nations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL C.T. DODD.]\r\n\r\nHon. Samuel C.T. Dodd, one of the ablest lawyers Pennsylvania has\r\nproduced, is general solicitor of the Standard and resides in New York.\r\nHis father, the venerable Levi Dodd, established the first Sunday-school\r\nand was president of the second company that bored for oil at Franklin,\r\nthe birthplace of his son in 1836. Young Samuel learned printing,\r\ngraduated from Jefferson College in 1857, studied law with James K. Kerr\r\nand was admitted to the Venango Bar in August of 1859. His brilliant\r\ntalents, conscientious application and legal acquirements quickly won\r\nhim a leading place among the successful jurists of the state. During a\r\npractice of nearly twenty-two years in the courts of the district and\r\ncommonwealth he stood in the front rank of his profession. He served\r\nwith credit in the Constitutional Convention of 1873, framing some of\r\nits most important provisions. He traveled abroad and wrote descriptions\r\nof foreign lands so charming they might have come from Washington Irving\r\nand N. P. Willis. His selection by the Standard Oil-Trust in 1881 as its\r\ngeneral solicitor was a marked recognition of his superior abilities.\r\nThe position, one of the most prominent and responsible to which a\r\nlawyer can attain, demanded exceptional qualifications. How capably it\r\nhas been filled the records of all legal matters concerning the Standard\r\nabundantly demonstrate. Mr. Dodd’s profound knowledge of\r\ncorporation-law, eminent sense of justice, forensic skill, rare tact and\r\nclear brain have steered the great company safely and honorably through\r\nmany suits involving grave questions of right and millions of money. The\r\npapers he prepared organizing the Standard Trust have been the models\r\nfor all such documents since they left his desk. Terse logic, sound\r\nreasoning, pointed analysis and apposite expression distinguish his\r\nlegal opinions and arguments, combining the vigor of a Damascus blade\r\nwith the beauty of an epic. He is a delightful conversationalist,\r\nsincere friend and prudent counsellor, kindly, affable and thoroughly\r\nupright. His home, brightened by a loving wife and devoted family, is\r\nsingularly happy. Amid the cares and anxieties incident to professional\r\nlife he has cultivated his fine literary-taste, writing\r\nmagazine-articles and wooing the muses at intervals of leisure only too\r\nfar apart. He has the honor of writing the first poem on petroleum that\r\never appeared in print. It was a rich parody on Byron’s “Isles of\r\nGreece” and was published in the spring of 1860, as follows:\r\n\r\n              The land of Grease! the land of Grease!\r\n                Where burning Oil is loved and sung;\r\n              Where flourish arts of sale and lease,\r\n                Where Rouseville rose and Tarville sprung;\r\n              Eternal summer gilds them not,\r\n              But oil-wells render dear each spot.\r\n\r\n              The ceaseless tap, tap of the tools,\r\n                The engine’s puff, the pump’s dull squeak,\r\n              The horsemen splashing through the pools\r\n                Of greasy mud along the Creek,\r\n              Are sounds which cannot be suppress’d\r\n              In these dear Ile-lands of the Bless’d.\r\n\r\n              Deep in the vale of Cherry Run\r\n                The Humboldt Works I went to see,\r\n              And sitting there an oil-cask on\r\n                I found that Grease was not yet free;\r\n              For busily a dirty carl\r\n              Was branding “bonded” on each barrel.\r\n\r\n              I sat upon the rocky brow\r\n                Which o’erlooks Franklin—far-famed town;\r\n              A hundred derricks stood below\r\n                And many a well of great renown;\r\n              I counted them at break of day,\r\n              And when the sun set where were they?\r\n\r\n              They were still there. But where art thou,\r\n                My dry-hole?

Rockefeller is\r\nprevailed upon to address an audience was last March in New York, at a\r\nsocial gathering of the Young Men’s Bible Class of the Fifth-Avenue\r\nBaptist-Church. Much that he said was extremely interesting. In laying\r\ndown many excellent precepts he brought forth several lessons from the\r\nexperiences of his early life. By references to his first ledger, as he\r\ncalled it, which was nothing more than a small paper-covered\r\nmemorandum-book, he explained how he managed to save money even on a\r\nsmall salary. The little book contained the first items of his receipts\r\nand expenditures when he first began to earn money. To judge from the\r\ncare with which he handled this reminder of his early struggles, Mr.\r\nRockefeller was in earnest when he intimated that it would require a\r\nfortune to purchase it. His address, purely informal and conversational,\r\nwas warmly applauded by his hearers and commended by the press. Its\r\npractical wisdom and the light it throws upon the early life of a most\r\nsuccessful man entitle it to careful preservation. Mr. Rockefeller said,\r\nas reported by the New-York _Tribune_:\r\n\r\nLet me say that it gives me a great deal of pleasure to be here\r\nto-night. Although I cannot make you a speech, I have brought with me to\r\nshow you young men a little book—a book, I think, which may interest\r\nyou. It is the first ledger I kept. I was trained in business affairs\r\nand how to keep a ledger. The practice of keeping a little personal\r\nledger by young men just starting in business and earning money and\r\nrequiring to learn its value is, I think, a good one. In the first\r\nstruggle to get a footing—and if you feel as I did I am sorry for you,\r\nalthough I would not be without the memory of that struggle—I kept my\r\naccounts in this book, also some memoranda of little incidents that\r\nseemed to me important. In after-years I found that book and brought it\r\nto New York. It is more than forty-two years since I wrote what it\r\ncontains. I call it Ledger A, and now I place the greatest value upon\r\nit. I have thought that it would be a little help to some of you young\r\nmen to read one or two extracts from this ledger. [Mr. Rockefeller then\r\nproduced from his pocket, carefully enveloped in paper-wrapping, the\r\nledger to which he referred, and continued his remarks]:\r\n\r\nWhen I found this book recently I thought it had no cover, because it\r\nhad writing upon its back. I had utilized the cover to write upon. In\r\nthose days I was economical, even with paper. When I read it through it\r\nbrought to my mind remembrances of the care with which I used to record\r\nmy little items of receipts and disbursements, matters which many of you\r\nyoung men are rather careless over. I believe it is a religious duty to\r\nget all the money you can fairly and honestly; to keep all you can and\r\nto give away all you can. I think that is a problem that you are all\r\nfamiliar with. I have told you before what pleasure this little book\r\ngives me. I dare not let you read it through, because my children, who\r\nhave read it, say that I did not spell tooth-brush correctly.\r\n[Laughter.] But you know we have made great progress in our spelling and\r\nI suppose some changes have taken place since those days. [Renewed\r\nlaughter.] I have not seen this book for twenty-five years. It does not\r\nlook like a modern ledger, does it? But you could not get that book from\r\nme for all the modern ledgers in New York, nor for all that they would\r\nbring. It almost brings tears to my eyes when I read over this little\r\nbook, and it fills me with a sense of gratitude that I cannot express.\r\nIt shows largely what I received and what I paid out during my first\r\nyears of business. It shows that from September twenty-sixth, 1855,\r\nuntil January first, 1856, I received $50. Out of that I paid my\r\nwasherwoman and the lady I boarded with, and saved a little money to put\r\naway. I am not ashamed to read it over to you.\r\n\r\nAmong other things I find that I gave a cent to the Sunday-school every\r\nSunday. That is not a very large sum, is it? But that was all the money\r\nI had to give for that particular object. I was also giving to several\r\nother religious objects. What I could afford to give I gave regularly,\r\nas I was taught to do, and it has been a pleasure to me all my life to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nI had a large increase in my revenue the next year. It went up to $25 a\r\nmonth. I began to be a capitalist and, had I regarded myself then as we\r\nregard capitalists now, I ought to have felt like a criminal because I\r\nhad so much money. But we had no trusts or monopolies then. [Laughter.]\r\nI paid my own bills and always had a little something to give away, and\r\nthe happiness of saving some. In fact, I am not so independent now as I\r\nwas then. It is true I could not secure the most fashionable cut of\r\nclothing. I remember I bought mine then of a Jew. [Laughter.] He sold me\r\nclothing cheap, clothing such as I could pay for, and it was a great\r\ndeal better than buying clothing that I could not pay for. I did not\r\nmake any obligations I could not meet. I lived within my means, and my\r\nadvice to you young men is to do just the same.\r\n\r\nDr. Faunce has just told you that all young men who come to this church\r\nare welcome and are never asked to whom they belong or where they came\r\nfrom. But there is just one question I would like to ask. I would like\r\nto know how many of you come from the city and how many come from the\r\ncountry. (Mr. Rockerfeller asked, as a personal favor, if all those\r\npresent in the room who came from the country would raise their right\r\nhand. Fully three-quarters of the number did so.) Now, what a story that\r\ntells!\r\n\r\nTo my mind there is something unfortunate in being born in a city. You\r\nhave not had the struggles in the city that we have had who were reared\r\nin the country. Don’t you notice how the men from the country keep\r\ncrowding you out here—you who have wealthy fathers? These young men from\r\nthe country are turning things around and are taking your city. We men\r\nfrom the country are willing to do more work. We were prepared by our\r\nexperience to do hard work. I remember a little time ago I was in the\r\ncountry and saw a carpenter placing mineral-wool under the roof of a\r\ncity servant’s bedroom, so that the man should not feel the heat of the\r\nsummer or hear the patter of the rain-drops on the roof. I could not at\r\nthe time help recalling the experience of my boyhood, when I slept under\r\na roof. While I could not see the shingles, I remember I could peep\r\nthrough the cracks in them. It was pretty hot in the summer up there,\r\ntoo, I can tell you. But I think I was better for all that sort of\r\nexperience, for having been reared in the country in that sturdy,\r\npractical way, and my heart is sometimes full of sadness as I\r\ncontemplate the condition of the number of young fellows in this city\r\nwhom I happen to know well.\r\n\r\nThey are in the embarrassing position that their fathers have great sums\r\nof money, and those boys have not a ghost of a chance to compete with\r\nyou who come from the country and who want to do something in the world.\r\nYou are in training now to shortly take the places of those young men. I\r\nsuppose you cannot realize how many eyes are upon you and how great is\r\nthe increasing interest that is taken in you. You may not think that,\r\nwhen you are lonely and find it difficult to get a footing. But it is\r\ntrue that, in a place like this, true interest is taken in you. When I\r\nleft the school-house I came into a place similar to this, where I\r\nassociated with people whom it was good to know. Nothing better could\r\nhave happened to me.\r\n\r\nI spoke just now of the struggle for success. What is success? Is it\r\nmoney? Some of you have all the money you need to provide for your\r\nwants. Who is the poorest man in the world? I tell you, the poorest man\r\nI know of is the man who has nothing but money—nothing else in the world\r\nupon which to devote his ambition and thought. That is the sort of man I\r\nconsider to be the poorest in the world. Money is good if you know how\r\nto use it.\r\n\r\nNow, let me leave this little word of counsel for you. Keep a little\r\nledger, as I did. Write down in it what you receive, and do not be\r\nashamed to write down what you pay away. See that you pay it away in\r\nsuch a manner that your father or mother may look over your book and see\r\njust what you did with your money. It will help you to save money, and\r\nthat you ought to do. When I spoke of a poor man with money I spoke\r\nagainst the poverty of that man who has no affection for anything else,\r\nor thought for anything else but money. That kind of a man does not help\r\nhis own character, nor does he build up the character of another.\r\n\r\nBefore I leave you I will read a few items from my ledger. I find in\r\nlooking over it that I was saving money all this time, and in the course\r\nof a few years I had saved $1,000. Now, as to some of my expenses. I see\r\nthat from November twenty-fourth, 1855, to April, 1856, I paid for\r\nclothing $9.09. I see also, here, another item which I am inclined to\r\nthink is extravagant, because I remember I used to wear mittens. The\r\nitem is a pair of fur-gloves, for which I paid $2.50. In the same\r\nperiod, I find I gave away $5.58. In one month I gave to\r\nforeign-missions ten cents; to the mite-society thirty cents, and there\r\nis also a contribution to the Five-Points Mission. I was not living then\r\nin New York, but I suppose I felt that it was in need of help, so I sent\r\nup twelve cents to the mission. Then to the venerable teacher of my\r\nclass I gave thirty-five cents to make him a present. To the poor people\r\nof the church I gave ten cents at this time. In January and February\r\nfollowing I gave ten cents more and a further ten cents to the\r\nforeign-missions. Those contributions, small as they were, brought me\r\ninto direct contact with philanthropic work, and with the beneficial\r\nwork and aims of religious institutions, and I have been helped thereby\r\ngreatly all my life. It is a mistake for a man who wishes for happiness\r\nand to help others to wait until he has a fortune before giving to\r\ndeserving objects. [Great applause.]\r\n\r\nAnd this exemplary citizen, who in his youth and poverty formed the\r\nhabit of systematic benevolence, who befriends the poor, who dispenses\r\ncharity with a bountiful hand, who helps young men better their\r\ncondition, who gives millions for education and religion, who believes\r\nin the justice of God and the rights of man, who has woven the raveled\r\nskeins of a weakened industry into the world’s grandest\r\nbusiness-enterprise, assassins of character picture as a cold-blooded\r\noppressor, a base conspirator, a “devourer of widows’ houses,” an\r\nabettor of larceny and instigator of arson! “Oh, Shame! where is thy\r\nblush?”\r\n\r\nAlthough the Standard pays the highest wages in the world and has never\r\nhad a serious strike in its grand army of forty-thousand men, not one\r\ncent of a reduction was ordered during the panic. No works stopped and\r\nno employés were turned adrift to beg or starve. On the contrary,\r\nimprovements and additions were made continually, the force of workmen\r\nwas augmented, cash was paid for everything bought, no claims remained\r\nunsettled and nobody had to wait an hour for money justly due. These are\r\npoints for the toiling masses, whom prejudice against big corporations\r\nsometimes misleads, to understand and consider before accepting the\r\ncreed that wealth and dishonor are synonymous, that each is the creature\r\nof the other and both are twin-links of the same sausage.\r\n\r\n                            A WELL-SHOOTER.\r\n\r\nThe Oil-City _Blizzard_, itself as lively as a glycerine-explosion, in a\r\nspasm of dynamite-enthusiasm loaded up and fired off this eccentricity:\r\n\r\n                 Pat Magnew was a shooter bold,\r\n                   Who handled glycerine;\r\n                 And though he had no printing-shop\r\n                   He ran a magazine.\r\n\r\n                 And while he had a level head,\r\n                   And business plenty found,\r\n                 ’Most ev’ry job he undertook\r\n                   He ran into the ground.\r\n\r\n                 He never claimed expert to be,\r\n                   But what he did was right,\r\n                 And when he shot a well, you see,\r\n                   He did it “out of sight.”\r\n\r\n                 He seemed to like his daily toil,\r\n                   Its dangers did not fear;\r\n                 He’d help his patrons to find oil,\r\n                   And then he’d disappear.\r\n\r\n                 Sometimes he shot wells with a squib,\r\n                   When at the proper level;\r\n                 Sometimes when he had been to church,\r\n                   He shot with a go-devil.\r\n\r\n                 He always had a great tin-shell\r\n                   Beside him on the seat,\r\n                 Had horses good and drove like—well,\r\n                   No moss grew on their feet.\r\n\r\n                 And when he drove along the road,\r\n                   And that was every day,\r\n                 Wise people all, who knew his load,\r\n                   Gave him the right of way.\r\n\r\n                 His wife once said: “I greatly fear\r\n                   That you will yet be blown\r\n                 To atoms, if you don’t, my dear,\r\n                   Let well enough alone.”\r\n\r\n                 “Some day there’ll be a thunder-sound;\r\n                   And scattered far and near,\r\n                 O’er hill and dale and all around,\r\n                   Will be my husband dear.”\r\n\r\n                 Replied Magnew: “I call to mind—\r\n                   His words are nowise sickly—\r\n                 That Billy Shakespeare once remarked:\r\n                   ‘’Twere well it were done quickly.’\r\n\r\n                 “And I’ll be blown,” continued Pat,\r\n                   “If I didn’t want it known,\r\n                 That I’d rather be by dynamite\r\n                   Than by a woman blown.”\r\n\r\n                       THE OLD YEAR DONE IN OIL.\r\n\r\n               Old Year! transported by fast freight,\r\n               With neither drawback nor rebate,\r\n               How odd it seems to quote thee “late!”\r\n\r\n               Old Year! since thou wert struck, alas!\r\n               What surface shows have men let pass—\r\n               They promised oil and yielded gas!\r\n\r\n               Old Year! test-wells of crude that smelt,\r\n               But had no sand like snows would melt.\r\n               Few always drill straight on the belt!\r\n\r\n               Old Year! thy option has expired,\r\n               Certificates have been retired\r\n               And royalty in full required.\r\n\r\n               Old Year! thy territory’s played,\r\n               Pipage and storage-charges paid,\r\n               Tanks emptied and delivery made.\r\n\r\n               Old Year! a twelvemonth pump’d thee dry,\r\n               Now tools and cable are laid by,\r\n               Engine and derrick idle lie.\r\n\r\n               Old Year! developments are o’er,\r\n               The paraffine has clogg’d each pore\r\n               And thou shalt operate no more.\r\n\r\n               Old Year! lease out and rig in dust,\r\n               Time on thy boiler, left to rust,\r\n               Writes the producer’s motto: “Bu’st!”\r\n\r\n               And when it comes our turn to be\r\n               Immediate shipment o’er life’s sea,\r\n               Old Year! we’ll put a call for thee!\r\n\r\n                           THE CANINE’S DOOM.\r\n\r\nWhen the Oil-City _Derrick_ had its circus with the Allegheny-Valley\r\nRailroad it fell to my lot to write up most of the incidents of the\r\nconflict.

It is the\r\none and only fuel that mines, transports and feeds itself, without\r\ndigging every spoonful, screening lumps, carting, freighting and\r\nshoveling into the stove or furnace. Getting it does not imperil the\r\nlimbs and lives of poor miners—the most overworked and underpaid class\r\nin Pennsylvania—in the damp and darkness of death-traps hundreds of feet\r\nbeneath the surface of the ground. You drill a hole to the vital spot,\r\nlay a pipe from the well to the home or factory, turn a stop-cock to let\r\nout the vapor, touch off a match and there it is—the brightest,\r\ncleanest, steadiest, hottest fire on earth. Not a speck of dust, not an\r\natom of smoke, not a particle of cinder, not a taint of sulphur, not a\r\nbit of ashes vexes your soul or tries your temper. There is no carrying\r\nof coal, no dumping of choked grates, no waiting for kindling to catch\r\nor green wood to burn, no scolding about sulky fires, no postponement of\r\nheat because the wind blows in the wrong direction. Blue Monday is\r\nrobbed of all its terrors, the labor of housekeeping is lightened and\r\nhusbands no longer object to starting the fire on cold mornings. A nice\r\nblaze may be let burn all night in winter and kept on tap in summer only\r\nwhen needed. It is lighted or extinguished as readily as the gas-jet in\r\nthe parlor. It melts iron, fuses glass, illumines mills and streets,\r\nbroils steaks to perfection and does away with many a fruitful source of\r\nfamily-broils. It saves wear and tear of muscle and disposition, lessens\r\nthe production of domestic quarrels, adds to the pleasure and\r\nsatisfaction of living and carries the spring-time of existence into the\r\nautumn of old age. Set in a dainty metal frame, with background of\r\nasbestos and mantel above, its glow is cheerful as the hickory-fire in\r\nthe hearth. It gives us the ingle-nook modernized and improved, the\r\nchimney-corner brought down to date. It glides through eighty-thousand\r\nmiles of pipes in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana and New\r\nYork and employs a hundred-million dollars to supply it to people within\r\nreach of the bounteous reservoirs the kindly earth has treasured all\r\nthrough the centuries. If it be not a blessing to humanity, the fault\r\nlies with the folks and not with the stuff. The man who spouts gas is a\r\nnuisance, but the well that spouts gas is something to prize, to utilize\r\nand be thankful for. Visitors to the oil-region or towns near enough to\r\nenjoy the luxury, beholding the beauty and adaptability of natural-gas,\r\nmay be pardoned for breaking the tenth commandment and coveting the fuel\r\nthat is Nature’s legal-tender for the comfort and convenience of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThe pretty town of Fredonia, in New York state, three miles from Lake\r\nErie and forty-five south-west of Buffalo, enjoys the distinction of\r\nfirst using natural-gas for illuminating purposes. It is a beautiful\r\nplace, famous for fine roads, fine scenery and fine vineyards. Canodonay\r\nCreek, a small but rapid stream, passes through it to the lake. Opinions\r\nvary as to the exact date when the gas was utilized, some authorities\r\nmaking it 1821, others 1824 and a few 1829. The best information fixes\r\nit at 1824, when workmen, in tearing down an old mill, observed bubbles\r\non the water that proved to be inflammable. The hint was not lost. A\r\ncompany bored a hole _one-inch-and-a-half_ in diameter into the\r\nlimestone-rock. The gas left its regular channel, climbed the hole,\r\nlighted a new mill and was piped to a hundred houses in the village at a\r\ncost of one-fifty a year for each. The flame was large and strong and\r\nfor years Fredonia was the only town in America lighted by “nature-gas.”\r\nA gasometer was constructed, which collected _eighty-eight_ cubic feet\r\nin twelve hours. The inhabitants didn’t keep late hours. A mile nearer\r\nLake Erie many gas-bubbles gamboled on the stream. Efforts to convey the\r\ngas to the light-house at Dunkirk failed, as it was only half the weight\r\nof air and would not descend the difference in elevation.\r\n\r\nA light-house at Erie was lighted by natural-gas in 1831, “the Burning\r\nSpring,” a sheet of water through which the vapor bubbled, furnishing\r\nthe supply. A tower erected over the spring held the gas that\r\naccumulated during the day and wooden-pipes conveyed it at night to the\r\nlight-house.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Oesterlin, a young German physician, sixty years ago\r\nunpacked his pill-boxes and hung out his little sign at Findlay, in\r\nNorthwestern Ohio. He was an expert geologist and mineralogist, but the\r\nflat Black Swamp afforded poor opportunities to study the rocks\r\nunderlying the limestone. The young physician detected the odor of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen in the town and along the banks of the Blanchard\r\nRiver. It puzzled him to guess the source of the odor. He spoke to the\r\nfarmers, who smelled the stuff, knew nothing and cared less about its\r\norigin or properties. The Doctor searched for a sulphur-spring. In\r\nOctober of 1836 the solution came. A farmer was digging a well three\r\nmiles from town. A spring was tapped and the water “boiled,” as the\r\ndiggers expressed it. Debating what to do, they were called to supper,\r\nreturned after dark and lighted a torch to examine the well. Holding the\r\ntorch over the well an explosion startled them and a flame ascended that\r\nlasted for days. Nobody was seriously hurt, but all thought the devil\r\nhad a finger in the pie. Dr. Oesterlin connected the incident with the\r\nodor and it confirmed his theory of a gas that would burn and might\r\nserve as fuel. At a stone-quarry he made a cone of mud over a fissure,\r\ncovered it with a bucket and applied a light. When the Doctor picked\r\nhimself up in an adjoining corn-field the bucket was still sailing north\r\ntowards Toledo. Daniel Foster, another Findlay farmer, dug a well in\r\n1838. Gas issued from the hole before water was seen. Foster had a\r\npractical mind. He inverted a copper-kettle over the hole, rigged a\r\nwooden pump-stock beneath the kettle, plastered around it with clay,\r\njoined more pump-stocks together, stuck an old gun-barrel in the end of\r\nthe last one, lighted the gas in his kitchen and by means of the flame\r\nboiled water, roasted coffee and illumined the apartment. Then Dr.\r\nOesterlin declared Findlay was right over a vast caldron of gas. People\r\nlaughed at him, adhered to tallow-dips and positively refused to swallow\r\nsuch a dose. Petroleum-developments in Pennsylvania fortified his faith\r\nand he sought to interest the public in a company to “bore a hole twenty\r\ninches across.” Sinners in Noah’s day were less impervious. Business-men\r\nscoffed and declined to subscribe for stock. He tried again in 1864 and\r\n1867 with the same result. A company was organized to manufacture\r\ncoal-gas. He talked of the absurdity of _making_ gas at Findlay as equal\r\nto setting up a manufactory of air or water. It was no use. At last the\r\ntriumph of natural-gas in Pennsylvania was manifested too strongly for\r\nthe obtuse Findlayites to ignore it. In 1884 the Doctor managed to\r\nenlist four-thousand dollars of capital and start a well in a grove a\r\nmile east of town, where the odor was pungent and gas flowing through a\r\ntile-pipe he planted in the ground burned for weeks. He watched the\r\nprogress of the work with feverish anxiety. The hopes of fifty long\r\nyears were to be grandly realized or dashed forever. Sleepless nights\r\nsucceeded restless days as the veteran’s heart-beats kept time with the\r\nrhythmic churning of the drill. At five, six and seven-hundred feet\r\nmorsels of gas quickened the expectations of success. At eleven-hundred\r\nfeet, in the Trenton limestone, on November tenth, 1884, gas burst forth\r\nwith terrific force. The well was drilled sixteen-hundred feet and\r\nencountered salt-water. It was plugged below the gas-vein, the gas was\r\nlighted, an immense flame shot up and for months a quarter-million feet\r\na day burned in the open air. Findlay grew from five-thousand to\r\nfifteen-thousand population and manufacturing flourished. Dr. Oesterlin,\r\nslight of frame, infirm with age, his thin locks and beard white as\r\nsnow, had waited fifty years for his vindication. It came when he had\r\nreached four-score, full, complete and overwhelming. He bore his honors\r\nmeekly, lived to round out eighty-two and nowhere is it recorded that he\r\neven once yielded to the temptation of remarking: “I told you so!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DR. CHAS. OESTERLIN                 SAMUEL SPEECHLY]\r\n\r\nGas was used as fuel at pumping-wells on Oil Creek in 1862. It was first\r\ncollected in “gas-barrels,” one pipe leading from the well to the\r\nreceptacle and another from the barrel to the boiler. Many fires\r\noriginated from the flame, when the pressure of gas was small, running\r\nback to the barrel and exploding it. A pumper at Rouseville, seated on a\r\ngas-barrel at such a moment, went skyward and may be ascending yet, as\r\nhe never returned for his week’s wages. D. G. Stillwell, better known as\r\n“Buffalo Joe,” drilled a gasser in 1867 at Oil City, on the site of the\r\nGreenfield Lumber-Company’s office. He piped the gas to several houses,\r\nbut the danger from constant changes of pressure led to its abandonment.\r\nThis is the first authentic record of the use of “the essence of Sheol”\r\nfor cooking food and heating dwellings. In 1883 the Oil-City Fuel-Supply\r\nCompany laid a six-inch gas-line to wells at McPherson’s Corners,\r\nPinegrove township, eight miles distant. The gas was produced from the\r\nsecond and third sands, at a depth of nine to ten-hundred feet and a\r\npressure not exceeding two-hundred pounds to the square inch. In 1885\r\nthe late Samuel Speechly started a well on his farm near McPherson’s,\r\nintending to drill three-thousand feet in search of the Bradford sand.\r\nOil-bearing strata dip twenty feet to the mile southward and Speechly\r\nbelieved the northern rocks existed far beneath the ordinary third-sand\r\nin Venango county. On April thirteenth, at nineteen-hundred feet, the\r\ndrill penetrated what has since been called the “Speechly sand,” the\r\nmost extraordinary and valuable fuel-sand as yet discovered. In this\r\nsand at three feet pressure of gas became entirely too great to keep\r\njerking the tools. The gas company leased the well and turned it into\r\nthe line without being able to gauge it on account of the high volume.\r\nSpeechly commenced a second well and the company, having previously laid\r\na new ten-inch line to Oil City, constructed branches to Franklin and\r\nTitusville. The second well proved to be the largest to the present\r\ntime, excepting the Big Moses in West Virginia. For a time it could not\r\nbe controlled. The roar of the escaping gas could be heard for miles.\r\nEventually it was tubed and the pressure was six-hundred pounds. Many\r\nwells in other fields have had greater pressure, but the large volume of\r\nthe Speechly well made it a wonder. One day all the other wells\r\nconnected with the main-line were discontinued from the line temporarily\r\nand the Jumbo turned in. The flow was sufficient to supply Oil City,\r\nTitusville and Franklin with all the gas required. Hundreds of wells\r\nhave been drilled to the Speechly sand and the field now reaches from\r\nthe southern part of Rockland township, Venango county, to Tionesta\r\ntownship, Forest county. It is about thirty miles long, with an average\r\nwidth of three miles, while the sand ranges in thickness from fifty to\r\none-hundred feet. The pressure gradually diminishes. It requires\r\nconstant drilling to keep up the supply, the Oil-City Company alone\r\nhaving about four-hundred wells.\r\n\r\nSamuel Speechly died on Sunday night, January ninth, 1893, aged\r\nsixty-one, at his home in the gas-district bearing his name. His life\r\nwas notably eventful, adventurous and fortunate. Born in England in\r\n1832, at fourteen he began to learn locomotive-building and\r\nmarine-engineering at Newcastle-on-Tyne. At twenty Robert Stephenson &\r\nCo. sent him to China to join a steamer engaged in the opium-trade. In\r\n1855 he entered the service of the Chinese government to suppress piracy\r\non the coast, and in 1857 started at Hong Kong the first\r\nengineering-business in the vast empire ruled by the pig-tailed Brother\r\nof the Sun. He visited America in 1872 and lived in Philadelphia.\r\nWanting plenty of room, he went to Northwestern Pennsylvania, resided a\r\nyear in Cranberry township, concluded to stay and settled on what\r\nsubsequently became the famous Speechly farm. The well he drilled in\r\n1885 had neither oil nor gas in the usual formations. Veteran operators\r\nadvised him to abandon it, but Speechly entertained a notion of his own\r\nand the world knows the sequel. He was married in China in 1864 to Miss\r\nMargaret Galbraith, who survives him, with two daughters, Emily, born in\r\nChina, and Adelaide, born in America. His widow and children occupy the\r\nold home on the farm.\r\n\r\nBishop Potter, stopping at Narrowsburg in 1854, noticed jets of gas\r\nexuding from the bank of the Delaware river at Dingman’s Ferry, forty\r\nmiles above Easton, and published an article on the subject. A company\r\nin 1860 bored three wells, but the result was not encouraging, as\r\npoliticians are the most gaseous bodies Northampton county has produced\r\nfor thirty years. A gas-well at Erie attracted considerable attention in\r\n1860 and was followed by a number more, which from a shallow depth\r\nyielded fuel to run several factories. East Liverpool, Ohio, put the\r\nproduct to practical use early in the seventies as a substitute for\r\ncoal. The first well, drilled in 1860, caught fire and destroyed the\r\nrig. Geologists say natural-gas is the disembodied spirits of plants\r\nthat grew in the sunshine of ages long before the foundations of the\r\nburied coal-measures were laid, so long ago shut up and forsaken by the\r\nlight-hearted sun that it is a wonder they hadn’t forgotten their former\r\naffinity. But they hadn’t. They rushed out to the devouring kiss of\r\ntheir old flame at the first tap of the drill on their prison-house,\r\nlike a foolish girl at the return of a fickle lover. They found Old Sol\r\nflirting with their younger sister, playing sweet to a lot of new\r\nvegetation. Before they had time to form a sewing-circle and resolve\r\nthat all the male sex are horrid, they took fire with indignation at his\r\nfickleness and the tool-dresser’s forge and burst with a tremendous\r\nexplosion. The fire was quenched and gas poured out of the pioneer-well\r\nfifteen years. Street-lamps were left burning all day, which was cheaper\r\nthan to bother putting them out, and East Liverpool prospered as a hive\r\nof the pottery-industry. The celebrated well at East Sandy, Venango\r\ncounty, which gave birth to Gas City in 1869, burned a year with a roar\r\naudible three miles. Becoming partially exhausted, the fire was put out\r\nand the product was used for fuel at numerous wells. The famous Newton\r\nwell, on the A. H. Nelson farm, was struck in May of 1872 and piped in\r\nAugust to Titusville, five miles south west. Its half-million cubic-feet\r\nper day supplied three-hundred firms and families with light and fuel.\r\nHenry Hinckley and A. R. Williams organized the company, one of the very\r\nfirst in Pennsylvania to utilize natural-gas on an extensive scale. The\r\nsame year gas from the Lambing well was piped to Fairview and Petrolia.\r\nThe Waugh well at Millerstown and the Berlin at Thompson’s Corners,\r\nButler county, were the next big gassers. The great Delamater No. 2,\r\nnear St. Joe, finished in 1874, for months was the biggest gas-well in\r\nthe world. Its output was conveyed to the rolling-mills at Sharpsburg.\r\nThe first gas-well in Butler county is credited to John Criswell, of\r\nNewcastle, who drilled for salt-water in 1840 near Centreville, struck a\r\nvein of the vapor at seven-hundred feet and fired it to heat his\r\nevaporating-pans.\r\n\r\nAt Leechburg and Apollo natural-gas has been used in puddling-furnaces\r\nsince 1872. It will supply the huge mills at Vandergrift, the model town\r\nthat is to be the county-seat of Vandergrift county, which the next\r\nLegislature will set off from Armstrong, Westmoreland and contiguous\r\ndistricts. It was the fuel of the cutlery-works at Beaver Falls from\r\n1876 until the wells ceased producing in 1884. In 1875 Spang & Chalfant\r\npiped it from Butler to their mills in the suburbs of Pittsburg. Though\r\nPittsburgers knew of its value in the oil-region for twenty years, they\r\nregarded it as a freak and not calculated to affect their interests\r\nfavorably. Iron manufactured by its means was of superior quality, owing\r\nto the absence of sulphur and the intensity of the heat. In 1877 the\r\nHaymaker well opened the Murraysville gas-field, but that immense\r\nstorehouse of potential energy lay dormant until Pew & Emerson piped the\r\nproduct to Pittsburg. In June of 1884 George Westinghouse, inventor of\r\nthe air-brake and of various electric-appliances, struck a gas-well near\r\nhis residence in Pittsburg. From that date the development was enormous.\r\nWells producing from two to twenty-million cubic-feet a day were in\r\norder. The Philadelphia Company—Westinghouse was its president—alone\r\ntied up forty-thousand acres of gas-territory, drilled hundreds of wells\r\nand laid thousands of miles of pipes. Hon. James M. Guffey headed big\r\ncorporations that supplied Wheeling, a portion of Pittsburg and dozens\r\nof smaller towns. The coal displacement in Pittsburg equaled\r\nthirty-thousand tons daily. Twenty and twenty-four-inch mains\r\nintersected the city. Iron, brass, steel and metal-working\r\nestablishments consumed it. Glass-factories turned out by its aid\r\nplate-glass such as mankind had never seen before. The flaming breath of\r\nthe new demon transformed the appearance and revolutionized the\r\niron-manufacture of the Birmingham of America. The Smoky City was a\r\nmisnomer. Soot and dirt and smoke and cinders disappeared. People washed\r\ntheir faces, men wore “biled shirts” and girls dressed in white. The\r\ntouch of a fairy-wand could not have made a more resplendent change.\r\nThink of green grass, emerald hues, clear sunlight and clean walls in\r\nPittsburg! At first timid folks feared to introduce it, because the\r\npressure could not be regulated. All this has been remedied. The\r\nroaring, hissing monster that almost bursts the gauge at the well is\r\ntamed and subjugated to the meekness of a dove by valves and gasometers,\r\nwhich can reduce the pressure to a single ounce. Queer, isn’t it, that\r\nPittsburg should be metamorphosed by natural-gas—the fires of hell as it\r\nwere—into a city of delightful homes, an industrial paradise?\r\n\r\nGas-wells of high pressure were found in Ohio by thousands, as though\r\nstriving to vie with the oil-wells which, beginning at Mecca in 1860 and\r\nending at Lima, stocked up twenty-million barrels of crude. Over\r\nthree-hundred companies were chartered in a year to supply every town\r\nfrom Cincinnati to Ashtabula. Natural-gas raged and blistered and for a\r\nterm was the genuine “Ohio idea.” For thirty years wells at New\r\nCumberland, West Virginia, have furnished fuel to burn brick. The same\r\nstate has the biggest gassers in existence and lines to important cities\r\nare projected. If “the mountain won’t come to Mohammed, Mohammed must go\r\nto the mountain.” Indiana has gas and oil in four counties, with Gas\r\nCity as headquarters and lots of fuel for houses and factories in\r\nIndianapolis and the chief cities. The Hoosiers have carried out the\r\nprinciple of Edward Eggleston’s Mrs. Means: “When you’re a-gittin’ git\r\nplenty, I say.” Illinois had a morsel of oil and gas in wells at\r\nLitchfield. Kentucky and Tennessee are blessed with “a genteel\r\ncompetence” and Kansas has not escaped. Michigan has gas-wells at Port\r\nHuron and St. Paul once boasted a company capitalized at a half-million.\r\nBuffalo inhaled its first whiff of natural-gas, piped from wells in\r\nMcKean county, on December first, 1886. Youngstown was initiated next\r\nday, from wells in Venango. A Mormon company bored wells at Salt Lake,\r\nbut polygamy was not supplanted by any odor more unsavory. In Canada gas\r\nis abundant and Robert Ferguson, now a well-to-do farmer near Port\r\nSarnia, first turned it into an engine-cylinder as a joke on the\r\nengineer at the pump-station in Enniskillen township. Steam was low, the\r\nengineer was absent, Ferguson cut the pipe leading from the boiler,\r\nconnected it with one from a gas-well near-by, opened the throttle and,\r\nto his astonishment, found the pressure greater than steam. Natural-gas,\r\na gift worthy of the immortal gods, worthy of the admiration of Vulcan,\r\nworthy of the praise of poets and historians, the agent of progress and\r\nsaver of labor, is not a trifle to be brushed off like a fly or\r\ndismissed with a contemptuous sneer.\r\n\r\nPittsburg iron-works and rolling-mills received natural-gas at about\r\ntwo-thirds the cost of coal. The coal needed to produce a ton of metal\r\ncost three dollars, the gas that did the same service cost one-ninety.\r\nBesides this important saving, the expense of handling the fuel, hauling\r\naway cinders and waiting for furnaces to heat or cool was avoided.\r\nGas-heat was uniform, stronger, more satisfactory, could be regulated to\r\nany temperature, turned on at full head or shut off instantly. Thus\r\nPittsburg possessed advantages that boomed its manufactories immensely\r\nand obliged many competitors less favored to retire. In this way the\r\nanomaly of freezing out men by the use of greater, cheaper heat was\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nOn March seventeenth, 1886, at Pittsburg, Milton Fisher, of Columbus,\r\nwas the first person to be incinerated in a natural-gas crematory. In\r\nfifty minutes the body was reduced to a handful of white powder. The\r\nfriends of the deceased pronounced the operation a success, but Fisher\r\nwas not in shape to express his opinion.\r\n\r\nA singular accident occurred near Hickory, Washington county, on the\r\nnight of December fourth, 1886. Alfred Crocker, an employé of the\r\nChartiers Gas-Company, had been at the tanks on the McKnight farm and\r\nwas going toward the well. The connecting-pipe between the well and tank\r\nburst with terrible force, striking Crocker on the left leg, blowing the\r\nfoot and ankle completely off and injuring him about the body. The\r\nexplosion hurled the large gas-tank a hundred feet. The young man died\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\nThe steam tow-boat Iron City once grounded near the head of Herr’s\r\nIsland, above Pittsburg. The stern swung around and caught on a pipe\r\nconveying natural-gas across the Allegheny river. In trying to back the\r\nvessel off the pipe broke, the escaping gas filled the hold and caught\r\nfire from the furnace. An explosion split the boat from stem to stern,\r\nblew off the deck and blew the crew into the river. The boat burned to\r\nthe water’s edge.\r\n\r\nNear Halsey, in the Kane field, James Bowser was standing on a gas-tank,\r\nwhile a workman was endeavoring to dislodge an obstruction in the pipe\r\nleading from the well. The removal of the obstruction caused the pent-up\r\ngas to rush into the tank with such force that the receptacle exploded,\r\nhurling Bowser high in the air. He alighted directly in front of the\r\nheavy volume of gas escaping through the broken pipe. Before he could be\r\nrescued he was denuded of all clothing, except one boot. His clothing\r\nwas torn off by the force of the gas and his injuries were serious.\r\n\r\nWorkmen laying pipe to connect with the main at Grapeville were badly\r\nflustered one frosty morning. By mistake the gas was turned on, rushing\r\nfrom the open end with great force. It ploughed up the earth and pebbles\r\nand ignited, the flinty stones producing a spark that set the whole\r\nthing in a blaze. Gas-wells yield liberally at Grapeville, supplying the\r\nglass-works at Jeannette and houses at Johnstown, the farthest point\r\neast to which the vapor-fuel has been piped.\r\n\r\nJ. S. Booker, an Ohio man, claimed to spot gas. His particular virtue\r\nlay in the muscles at the back of the neck, which rise up and irritate\r\nhim in the presence of natural-gas. This is ahead of rheumatism as a\r\nrain-indicator. Booker’s own story is that an attack of asthma left him\r\nin a sensitive state, so that when he passes over a vein of gas the\r\nelectricity runs through his legs, up his spine and knots the muscles of\r\nthe neck. The story deserves credit for its rare simplicity. With the\r\nwhole realm of fiction at his command, Booker chose only a few simple\r\ndetails and was content to pass current as a sort of human witch-hazel.\r\n\r\nAt Economy, where a hundred stand-pipes for natural-gas illuminate the\r\nstreets, bugs and fruit-vermin were slaughtered wholesale. In the\r\nmornings there would be a fine carpet of bugs around every post.\r\nChickens and turkeys would have a feast and a foot-race from the roosts\r\nto see which would get to the already-cooked breakfast first. The trees\r\ncame out in bloom earlier and healthier than formerly, because the\r\nvermin were destroyed and the frosts kept from settling by the\r\ngas-lights, which burn constantly. As a promoter of vegetation\r\nnatural-gas beats General Pleasanton’s blue-glass out of sight.\r\n\r\nSamuel Randall, the Democratic statesman, visited the gas-wells at\r\nMurraysville with Hon. J. M. Guffey. From a safe distance the visitor\r\nthrew a Roman candle at a huge column of vapor, which blazed quicker\r\nthan a church-scandal, to Mr. Randall’s great delight. President and\r\nMrs. Cleveland were afforded a similar treat by Mr. Guffey. The\r\nchivalrous host chartered a train and had a big well fired for the\r\ndistinguished visitors. The lady of the White House was in ecstacies and\r\nthe President evidently thought the novel exhibition knocked\r\nduck-shooting silly. Could a mind-reader have X-rayed his\r\nthinking-department it would likely have assumed this form: “Mr. Guffey,\r\n_you_ have a tremendous body of gas here, but _I_ have Congress on my\r\nhands!”\r\n\r\nEli Perkins lectured at St. Petersburg one night and next day rode with\r\nme through part of the district. He wanted points regarding natural-gas\r\nand smilingly jotted down a lot of Munchausenisms current in the\r\noil-region. A week later he sent me a marked copy of the New-York _Sun_,\r\nwith columns of delicious romance concerning gas-wells. Eli was no\r\nslouch at drawing the long-bow, but he fairly surpassed himself, Jules\r\nVerne and Rider Haggard on this occasion. His vivid stories of tools\r\nhurled by gas a thousand feet, of derricks lifted up bodily, of men\r\ntossed to the clouds and picturesque adventures generally were marvels\r\nof smooth, easy, fascinating exaggeration. Perhaps “if you see it in the\r\n_Sun_ it’s so,” but not when Eli Perkins is the chronicler and\r\nnatural-gas the subject.\r\n\r\n“The Fredonia Gas-Light and Water-Works Company,” which obtained a\r\nspecial charter in 1856, was undoubtedly the first natural-gas company\r\nin the world. Its object was, “by boring down through the slate-rock and\r\nsinking wells to a sufficient depth to penetrate the manufactories of\r\nnature, and thus collect from her laboratories the natural-gas and\r\npurify it, to furnish the citizens with good cheap light.” The tiny\r\nstream of gas first utilized at the mill yielded its mite forty years.\r\nWhen Lafayette remained a night at Fredonia in 1824, on his triumphal\r\nvisit to the United States, “the village-inn was lighted with gas that\r\ncame from the ground.” The illustrious Frenchman saw nothing in his\r\ntravels that interested and delighted him more than this novel\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nCol. J. A. Barrett, for many years a citizen of Illinois and law-partner\r\nof Abraham Lincoln, in 1886 removed to a tract of five-thousand acres on\r\nTug Fork, near the quiet hamlet of Warfield. Gas issued from the soil\r\nand tradition says George Washington fired the subtle vapor at Burning\r\nSpring while surveying in West Virginia before the Revolution. Captain\r\nA. Allen, who pioneered the oil-business on Little Kanawha, leased the\r\ntract from Col. Barrett and struck a vast reservoir of gas at\r\ntwo-thousand feet.\r\n\r\nJohn G. Saxe once lectured at Pithole and was so pleased with the people\r\nand place that he donated twenty-five dollars to the charity-fund and\r\nwrote columns of descriptive matter to a Boston newspaper. “If I were\r\nnot Alexander I would be Diogenes,” said the Macedonian conqueror.\r\nSimilarly Henry Ward Beecher remarked, when he visited Oil City to\r\nlecture, “If I were not pastor of Plymouth church I would be pastor of\r\nan Oil-City church.” The train conveying Dom Pedro, Emperor of Brazil,\r\nthrough the oil-regions stopped at Foxburg to afford the imperial guest\r\nan opportunity to see an oil-well torpedoed. He watched the filling of\r\nthe shell with manifest interest, dropped the weight after the torpedo\r\nhad been lowered and clapped his hands when a column of oil rose in the\r\nair. An irreverent spectator whispered: “This beats playing pedro.”\r\n\r\nDaniel Fisher, ex-mayor of Oil City and chief of the fire-department,\r\ndonned a new suit one day when oil-tanks abounded in the Third Ward.\r\nHearing a cry of distress, he mounted a tank and saw a man lying on the\r\nbottom, in a foot of thick oil. He dropped through the hatchway, pulled\r\nup the victim of gas and with great difficulty dragged him up the small\r\nladder into the fresh air. Of course, the new clothes were spoiled\r\nbeyond hope of redemption. The man revived, said his name was Green,\r\nthat he earned a living by cleaning out tank-bottoms and was thus\r\nemployed when overcome by gas. Next day Fisher met Green, who thanked\r\nhim again for saving his life, borrowed ten dollars and never repaid the\r\nloan or offered to set up a new suit of clothes.\r\n\r\n“Brudders an’ sistern,” ejaculated a colored preacher, “ef we knowed how\r\nmuch de good Lawd knows about us it wud skeer us mos’ to deff.” A\r\nFranklin preacher once seemed to forget that the Lord was posted\r\nconcerning earthly affairs, as he prayed thirty-six minutes at the\r\nexercises on Memorial Day. The sun beat down upon the bare heads of the\r\nassembled multitude, but the divine prayed right along from Plymouth\r\nRock to the close of the war. Col. J. S. Myers, the veteran lawyer,\r\npresided. Great drops of perspiration rolled down his face, but he was\r\nlike the henpecked husband who couldn’t get away and had to grin and\r\nbear it. He summed up the situation in a sentence: “I think ministers\r\nought to take it for granted that the Almighty knows enough American\r\nhistory to get along nicely without having it prayed at Him by the\r\nhour!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE AT OIL CITY AFTER THE DISASTER ON JUNE 5, 1892.]\r\n\r\nFire and water have scourged the oil-regions sorely. A flood in March of\r\n1865 submerged Oil City, floated off hundreds of oil-tanks and small\r\nbuildings and did damage estimated at four-millions of dollars. Fire in\r\nMay of 1866 wiped out half the town, the loss footing up a million\r\ndollars. The most appalling disaster occurred on Sunday, June fifth,\r\n1892. Heavy rains raised Oil Creek to such a height that mill-dams at\r\nSpartansburg and Riceville gave way, precipitating a vast mass of water\r\nupon Titusville during Saturday night. With a roar like thunder it\r\nstruck the town. Sleepers were awakened by the resistless tide and\r\ndrowned. Refineries and tanks of oil caught fire and covered acres of\r\nthe watery waste with flames. Helpless men, women and children tottered\r\nand tumbled and disappeared, the death-roll exceeding fifty. The two\r\nelements seemed to strive which could work the greater destruction.\r\nAbove Oil City a huge tank of benzine was undermined and upset on Friday\r\nmorning. The combustible stuff floated on the creek, which had risen\r\nfour feet over the floors of houses on the flats. The boiler-fire at a\r\nwell near the Lake-Shore tunnel ignited the cloud of benzine. An\r\nexplosion followed such as mortal eyes and ears have seldom seen and\r\nheard. The report shook the city to its foundations. A solid sheet of\r\nflame rose hundreds of feet and enveloped the flats in its fatal\r\nembrace. Houses charred and blazed at its deadly touch and fifty persons\r\nperished horribly. The sickening scene reminded me of the Johnstown\r\ncarnage in 1889, with its miles of flooded ruins and dreadful blaze at\r\nthe railroad-bridge. Whole families were blotted out. Edwin Mills, his\r\nwife and their five children died together. Heroic rescues and marvelous\r\nescapes were frequent. John Halladay Gordon saved forty people in his\r\nboat, rowing it amid the angry flames and swirling waters at imminent\r\nrisk. The recital of brave deeds and thrilling experiences would fill a\r\nvolume. That memorable Sunday was the saddest day Oil City and\r\nTitusville ever witnessed. The awful grandeur of the spectacle at both\r\nplaces has had no parallel.\r\n\r\nSweeping into the yards of a refinery at the upper end of Titusville,\r\nthe water tore open a tank containing five-thousand gallons of gasoline.\r\nFarther down an oil-tank and a gasoline-tank were rent in twain. Water\r\ncovered the streets and shut people in their houses. The gas-works and\r\nthe electric-plant were submerged and the city was in darkness. At\r\nmidnight a curious mist lay thick and dense and white for a few feet\r\nabove the water. It was the gasoline vapor, a cartridge a half-mile\r\nlong, a quarter-mile wide and two yards thick, with a coating of oil\r\nbeneath, waiting to be fired. One arm of the mist reached into the open\r\nfurnaces of the Crescent Works and touched the live coals on the grate.\r\nThere was a flash as if the heavens had been split asunder. Then the\r\nexplosion came and death and havoc reigned. And the horror was repeated\r\nat Oil City, until people wondered if the Day of Judgment could be more\r\nterrifying. The infinite pity and sadness of it all!\r\n\r\nThe burning of the Acme Refinery at Titusville, on June eleventh, 1886,\r\nentailed a loss of six-hundred-thousand dollars. It caught from a tank\r\nlightning had struck. By great efforts the railroad-bridge and the\r\nOctave Refinery were saved. The fire raged three days and nights, and\r\nthe departments from Warren, Corry and Oil City were called to render\r\nassistance. Hardly a town in the oil-regions has been unharmed by fire\r\nor flood, while many have been ravaged by both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS OF THE ACME REFINERY, TITUSVILLE, AFTER THE FIRE ON\r\nJUNE 1, 1880.]\r\n\r\nThe fire that desolated St. Petersburg started in Fred Hepp’s\r\nbeer-saloon. Hepp had a sign representing a man attempting to lift a\r\nschooner of lager as big as himself and remarking, “Oxcuse me ov you\r\nbleese.” The fire “oxcused” him from further exertion. Two destructive\r\nconflagrations almost eliminated Parker from the face of the earth.\r\nKarns City experienced three fiery visitations. In 1874 sixty-four\r\nbuildings in the heart of town went up in smoke. Sixteen followed in\r\nSeptember, 1876, the post-office and two largest stores figuring in the\r\nlist. On March fifth, 1877, Mrs. F. E. Bateman, three children and a\r\nguest perished in the Bateman House. Bateman, one son and one guest were\r\ncaught in the flames and burned fatally, dying in a few hours. Burning\r\ncoals adhering to a chunk of a bursting boiler, on Cherry Run, near the\r\nReed well, plunged into a tank of oil and started a frightful blaze.\r\nAcres of the valley, covered with derricks and tanks, flamed with the\r\nfury of a veritable hell. Men fled to the hills and no life was lost. A\r\ntrain of blazing tank-cars on the Allegheny-Valley Railroad, below\r\nFoster station, interrupted travel for many hours. The passenger-train\r\nfrom Pittsburg stopped and the passengers walked up the track to see the\r\nhuge blaze. Thomas Bennett, the engineer, went a short distance ahead,\r\nwhen an iron-tank exploded with fearful violence, one piece striking\r\nBennett in the breast and killing him instantly. David Ker was conductor\r\nof the train poor Bennett did not live to guide to its destination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS MARTINDALE.]\r\n\r\nThomas Martindale, who leads the retail-grocery trade, brought with him\r\nto Philadelphia twenty years ago the vim and energy that gained him fame\r\nand fortune in the oil-region. He clerked for years in a Boston\r\ndry-goods store, quit Massachusetts for Pennsylvania and landed at Oil\r\nCity in 1869. He took the first job that offered—grubbing out a road to\r\nhis wells for John S. Rich—used eyes and brain and soon knew how to “run\r\nengine.” Buying an interest in a grocery, his “Checkered Store” became\r\nnoted for excellent wares and low prices. The “Blue Store,” larger and\r\nbetter, followed and was in turn succeeded by the “Mammoth.” Martindale\r\nsold to Steffee & Co., moved to Philadelphia and opened the first\r\nCalifornia store. It was a revelation to the citizens to get fruits and\r\nwines straight from the Pacific coast and they patronized him liberally.\r\nPartners were taken in, whom the head of the firm imbued with something\r\nof his own energy and magnetism. Active in politics and trade,\r\nwide-awake and public-spirited, many Philadelphians contend that the\r\nnext mayor of the Quaker City shall spell his name Thomas Martindale. He\r\nis a trenchant writer and has published “Sport Royal,” an admirable work\r\ndescriptive of hunting adventures in which he participated. The live\r\nmerchant who caught the inspiration of five-dollar oil is sixteen ounces\r\nto the pound every time and every place.\r\n\r\n“Never quarrel with a preacher or an editor,” said Henry Clay, “for the\r\none can slap you from the pulpit and the other hit you in his paper\r\nwithout your getting a chance to strike back.” Col. William Phillips,\r\npresident of the Allegheny-Valley Railroad, violated the Kentucky\r\nstatesman’s wise maxim by making war on the Oil-City _Derrick_. He was\r\nbuilding the Low-Grade division, from Red Bank to Emporium, and the\r\nmain-line suffered. The track was neglected, decayed ties and broken\r\nrails were common and accidents occurred too frequently for comfort. The\r\nwinter and spring of 1873 were fruitful of disaster. At Rockland an\r\noil-train ran over the steep bank into the river, upsetting the\r\npassenger-coach at the rear. The oil caught fire, several passengers\r\nwere burned to death and others were terribly injured. The railroad\r\nofficials, acting under orders from headquarters, refused to give\r\ninformation to the crowd of frantic people who besieged the office at\r\nOil City to learn the fate of friends on the train. To the last moment\r\nthey denied that anything serious had happened, although passengers able\r\nto walk to Rockland Station telegraphed brief particulars. At last a\r\ntrain bearing some of the injured reached Oil City. Next morning the\r\n_Derrick_ gave full details and criticised the management of the road\r\nseverely for the bad condition of the track and the stupid attempt to\r\nwithhold information. The heading of the article—“Hell Afloat”—enraged\r\nCol. Phillips. He and Superintendent J. J. Lawrence prepared a circular\r\nto the conductors, instructing them “to take up pass of C. E. Bishop or\r\nJ. J. McLaurin whenever presented, collect full fare, prohibit newsboys\r\nfrom selling the Oil-City _Derrick_ on the trains, not allow the paper\r\nto be carried except in the mails or as express-matter, and to report to\r\nthe General Superintendent.” Conductor Wench, a pleasant, genial fellow,\r\non my next trip from Parker looked perplexed as he greeted me. He\r\nhesitated, walked past, returned in a few moments and asked to see my\r\npass. The document was produced, he drew a letter from his pocket and\r\nshowed it to me. It was the order signed by Phillips and Lawrence.\r\n“That’s clear enough, here’s your fare,” was my rejoinder. It was agreed\r\nat the office to say nothing for a day or two. Doubtless Phillips and\r\nLawrence thought the paper had been scared and would send a flag of\r\ntruce. A big wreck afforded the opportunity to open hostilities. For\r\nmonths the war raged. The paper had a regular heading—“Another Accident\r\non the Valley of the Shadow Road”—which was printed every morning.\r\nAccidents multiplied and travel sought other lines. Phillips threatened\r\nto remove the shops from South Oil City, his partners wished Bishop to\r\nlet up, he refused and they bought his interest. Peace was proclaimed,\r\nthe road was put into decent order and the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\neventually secured it. The fight had no end of comical features. It\r\nworried Col. Phillips exceedingly and spread the reputation of the\r\n_Derrick_ over the continent. The cruel war is over and Col. Phillips\r\nand Col. Lawrence journeyed to the tomb long years ago.\r\n\r\n“Jim” Collins—he ought to be manager—is about the only one of the early\r\nconductors on the Allegheny-Valley Railroad still in the traces. His\r\nrecord of twenty-seven years shows capable, faithful attention to duty\r\nand care for the comfort and safety of passengers that has gained him\r\nthe highest popularity. Superintendent “Tom” King, now vice-president of\r\nthe Baltimore & Ohio, is among the foremost railroad-officials of the\r\nUnited States. His brother was crushed to death by the cars. Wench, the\r\nTaylors, Reynolds and Bonar have been off the road many years. Long\r\ntrains of crude are also missing, some towns along the route have\r\ndisappeared and the crowds of operators who formerly thronged the line\r\nbetween Parker and Oil City have vanished from the scene. David Kerr,\r\nwhom Collins succeeded, went to Arkansas. John McGinnes, one of the\r\nbravest engineers who ever pulled a throttle, headed the\r\nrailroad-strikers in 1877 and died six years ago. “Jim” Bonnar is in\r\nChicago, Grant Thomas is train-dispatcher and “Dick” Reynolds\r\nsuperintends a Baltimore road. The Allegheny-Valley, extended to\r\nOil-City in the winter of 1867-8, is different from what it was when the\r\nsuperintendent walked over the entire track every day and the president\r\napplied formally to the directors for authority to purchase a new lock\r\nfor his desk.\r\n\r\nThe first railroad to enter Oil City was the Atlantic & Great Western,\r\nnow of the Erie system, in 1866. Its first train crossed the mouth of\r\nOil Creek on a track laid upon the ice. “Billy” Stevens and John Babcock\r\nwere early conductors. Stevens went to Maine and Babcock died several\r\nyears ago at Meadville, soon after completing a term as mayor of the\r\ncity. The Farmers’ Railroad was finished in 1867, the Allegheny Valley\r\nin 1868 and the Lake-Shore in 1870. A short railroad up Sage Run\r\nconveyed coal from the Cranberry mines. On August fourth, 1882, the\r\nengineer—Frank Wright—lost control of a train on the down grade, one of\r\nthe steepest in the state. He reversed the engine to the last notch and\r\njumped, sustaining injuries that caused his death in four days. For two\r\nmiles the track was torn up and coal-cars were smashed to splinters by\r\nrunning into a train of freight-cars at McAlevy’s Mills. Six men were\r\nkilled outright and five died from their injuries next day.\r\n\r\nThe popular auditor of the New York Central, W. F. McCullough, was an\r\nOil-City boy. His brother, James McCullough, is traveling-auditor of the\r\nNew York, New Haven & Hartford; another brother, E. M. McCullough, is\r\ntraveling bill-agent for the U. S. Steamship-Railway Company. They are\r\nsons of the late Dr. T. C. McCullough, who died at Oil City in 1896.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM H. STEVENS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANK THOMSON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN BABCOCK.]\r\n\r\nHon. Thomas Struthers, of Warren, who died in 1892 at the age of\r\neighty-nine, donated the town a public-library building that cost\r\nninety-thousand dollars. He aided in constructing the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad, built sections of the Philadelphia & Erie and Oil-Creek\r\nRailroads and the first railroad in California. He was the first manager\r\nof the Oil-Creek road. Frank Thomson, the capable president of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, was also superintendent of the Oil-Creek. C. J.\r\nHepburn, now residing in Harrisburg and permanently disabled as the\r\nresult of an accident, held the same position for years. He was a\r\nthorough railroader, esteemed alike by the employés and the public for\r\nhis efficient performance of duty. The old-time Oil-Creek conductors\r\nwere lock-switch, steel-track and rock-ballast clear through. Gleason,\r\npostmaster at Corry a term or two, runs the Mansion House at Titusville.\r\n“Bill” Miller is on the Pacific coast. Mack Dobbins died at St. Louis\r\nand “By” Taylor has made his last trip. Barber lives at Buffalo. “Mike”\r\nSilk, who yanked oil-trains from Cherry Run, is a wealthy citizen of\r\nWarren. Selden Stone and “Pap” Richards are still on deck, the last of a\r\ncoterie of as white railroad-men as ever punched pasteboard “in the\r\npresence of the passenjare.”\r\n\r\n        “We live in deeds, not years; in thoughts, not breaths;\r\n        In feelings, not in figures on a dial.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. G. POST]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. J. YOUNGSON.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. B. YOUNGSON.]\r\n\r\nFew railroaders are so widely and favorably known as A. B. Youngson. For\r\ntwenty-three years he was locomotive-engineer on the Atlantic road.\r\nEvery man, woman and child on the Franklin branch, between Meadville and\r\nOil City, knew and liked the clever, competent man who sat in the cab\r\nand never neglected his duty. Seven years ago Mr. Youngson was appointed\r\nAssistant Grand Chief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, a\r\nposition his experience and geniality adapt him admirably to fill. His\r\nbrother, J. J. Youngson, has been connected with the Atlantic road—now\r\ncalled the New York, Philadelphia & Ohio—for thirty years as\r\nsuperintendent of the water-works department of the system. A. G. Post,\r\na veteran ever to be found at his post, is deservedly popular as a\r\nconductor. Peter Bowen, the trusty roadmaster, who used to keep the\r\ntrack in apple-pie order, years ago traveled the track “across the\r\ndivide.” From President Thomas down to the humblest laborer the “Nypano”\r\nofficials and employés are not excelled in efficiency, courtesy and\r\nmanliness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW CARNEGIE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAVID MCCARGO.]\r\n\r\nAndrew Carnegie, the colossus of the iron-trade, was a stockholder of\r\nthe Columbia Oil-Company, which operated the Storey farm, on Oil\r\nCreek. The money he obtained from this source enabled him to gain\r\ncontrol of the Braddock Steel-Works. Starting in life as a telegraph\r\nmessenger-boy, he soon learned to manipulate the key expertly and was\r\nplaced in charge of the railroad-office at Atlantic, Ohio. Thomas A.\r\nScott, then superintendent of the Pittsburg Division of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad, engaged him as his clerk and operator. Scott\r\nestablished his headquarters at Altoona and promoted young Carnegie to\r\nthe chief-clerkship. His shrewdness and fidelity won favor and\r\nadvancement. He was appointed superintendent of the Pittsburg\r\nDivision, and in 1864 selected David McCargo as his assistant.\r\nMcCargo, who had been operator in the Commercial Telegraph office,\r\nsuperintended the Pennsylvania-Railroad telegraph-service. Robert\r\nPitcairn, first an operator at Hollidaysburg, was transferred to\r\nAltoona, went thence to Fort Wayne with J. N. DuBarry, afterwards\r\nvice-president of the “Pennsy,” and returned about 1870 to succeed\r\nCarnegie on the Pittsburg Division. He is now one of the highest\r\nofficials of the Pennsylvania and lives in Pittsburg. Mr. McCargo\r\nbecame General Superintendent of the Pacific & Atlantic Lines in 1868.\r\nIn 1875 he was appointed General Superintendent of the Allegheny\r\nValley Railroad. This responsible position he has held twenty-two\r\nyears, greatly to the advantage of the road and the satisfaction of\r\nthe public. Carnegie invested in oil and sleeping-car stock and\r\nenjoyed Col. Scott’s confidence. The railroad-king died and his clever\r\nclerk eventually controlled the steel plant ten miles east of\r\nPittsburg. Now Andrew Carnegie bosses the steel-industry, owns the\r\nlargest steel-plants in the world, manufactures massive armor-plate\r\nfor war-ships—blow-holes blew holes in its reputation “once upon a\r\ntime”—and has acquired forty or fifty-millions by the sweat of his\r\nworkmen’s brows. He has parks and castles in Scotland, spends much of\r\nhis time and cash abroad, coaches with princes and nobles and lets H.\r\nC. Frick fricasee the toilers at Braddock and Homestead. The Homestead\r\nriots, precipitated by a ruffianly horde of Pinkerton thugs, aroused a\r\nstorm of indignation which defeated Benjamin Harrison for the\r\npresidency and elected Grover Cleveland on the issue of tariff-reform.\r\nMr. Carnegie writes soul-stirring magazine articles on the duties of\r\ncapital to labor and has established numerous public-libraries. He is\r\nstoutly built and exceedingly healthy. His enormous fortune may yet\r\nendow some magnificent charity.\r\n\r\n            “Oh! it is excellent to have a giant’s strength,\r\n            But it is tyrannous to use it like a giant.”\r\n\r\nYou may meet them at Oshkosh or Kalamazoo, in New York or Washington,\r\naround Chicago or San Francisco, about New Orleans or Mexico, but not a\r\nfew men conspicuously successful in finance, manufactures, literature or\r\npolitics have been mixed up with oil some time in their career.\r\nCommodore Vanderbilt, Jay Gould, James Fisk, Thomas A. Scott, John A.\r\nGarrett and A. J. Cassatt profited largely from their oil-interests. Mr.\r\nCassatt, superintending the Warren & Franklin Railroad, acquired the\r\nknowledge of oil-affairs he turned to account in shaping the\r\ntransportation-policy of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Besides the colossal\r\ngains of the Standard Oil-Company, petroleum won for such men as Captain\r\nJ. J. Vandergrift, J. T. Jones, J. M. Guffey, John McKeown, John Galey,\r\nJ. J. Carter, Charles Miller, Frederic Prentice, S. P. McCalmont,\r\nWilliam Hasson, George V. Forman, Thomas W. Phillips, John Satterfield,\r\nH. L. Taylor, John Pitcairn, Theodore Barnsdall, E. O. Emerson, Dr.\r\nRoberts, George K. Anderson, Jonathan Watson, Hunter & Cummings,\r\nGreenlee & Forst, the Grandins, the Mitchells, the Fishers, the\r\nMcKinneys, the Plumers, the Lambertons and a host of others from one to\r\nten-millions apiece. Certainly coal, cotton or iron, or all three\r\ncombined, can show no such list. Oil augmented the fortunes of Stephen\r\nWeld, Oliver Ames and F. Gordon Dexter, the largest in New England. It\r\nput big money into the pockets of Andrew Carnegie, William H. Kemble and\r\nDr. Hostetter. To it the great tube-works, employing thousands of men,\r\nand multitudes of manufacturing-plants owe their existence and\r\nprosperity. Some of the brightest newspaper-writers in New York,\r\nPhiladelphia and Chicago learned force and directness amid the exciting\r\nscenes of Oildom. Several are authors of repute and contributors to\r\nmagazines. Grover Cleveland, while mayor of Buffalo, imbibed\r\nbusiness-wisdom and notions of sturdy independence from his acquaintance\r\nwith Bradford oil-operators. Governor Curtin was a large stockholder in\r\noil-companies on Cherry Run and Governor Beaver may claim kin with the\r\nfraternity as the owner of oil-wells in Forest county. No member of\r\nCongress for a generation made a better record than J. H. Osmer, Dr.\r\nEgbert, J. C. Sibley, C. W. Stone and Thomas W. Phillips. Galusha A.\r\nGrow was president of the Reno Oil-Company. Mr. Sibley was tendered the\r\nsecond place on the Democratic ticket at Chicago and could have been\r\nnominated for president, instead of William J. Bryan, but for the stupid\r\nhostility of a Pennsylvania boss. More capable, influential members than\r\nW. S. McMullan, Lewis Emery, J. W. Lee, W. R. Crawford, William H.\r\nAndrews, Captain Hasson, Willis J. Hulings, Henry F. James and John L.\r\nMattox never sat in the State Senate or the Legislature. And so it goes\r\nin every part of the country, in every profession, in every branch of\r\nindustry and in every business requiring vigor and enterprise.\r\n\r\nMichael Geary, whose death last year was a severe blow to Oil City,\r\nforcibly illustrated what energy and industry may accomplish. He was a\r\nfirst-class boiler-maker and machinist, self-reliant, stout-hearted and\r\nstrong mentally and physically. In 1876 he started the Oil-City\r\nBoiler-Works in a small building, Daniel O’Day and B. W. Vandergrift\r\nfurnishing the money and taking an interest in the business. O’Day and\r\nGeary became sole owners in 1882. The plant was enlarged, the tube-mills\r\nwere added, acres of buildings dotted the flats and a thousand men were\r\nemployed. Engines, tanks, stills, tubing, casing and boilers of every\r\ndescription were manufactured. The machinery comprised the latest and\r\nfullest equipment. The business grew amazingly. Joseph Seep was admitted\r\nto partnership and branch-offices were established in New York, Chicago,\r\nPittsburg and at various points in the oil-producing states. The firm\r\nled the world as tank-builders, actually constructing one-third the\r\ntotal iron-tankage in the United States. Mr. Geary bought and remodeled\r\nthe Arlington Hotel, fostered local enterprises and was a most\r\nprogressive citizen. He died in the vigor of manhood. The splendid\r\nindustries he reared and the high place he held in public esteem are his\r\nenduring monument.\r\n\r\n                                        “He had kept\r\n        The whiteness of his soul, and thus men o’er him wept.”\r\n\r\nSince Christmas day of 1873, when they struck their first well at\r\nMillerstown, Showalter Brothers have been leading operators in the\r\nButler field. Hon. Joseph B. Showalter, who has managed the firm’s\r\naffairs wisely, was born in Fayette County, taught school at sixteen,\r\nrelinquished teaching for medicine, and was graduated in 1884 from the\r\nBaltimore College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 1886 he was elected to\r\nthe legislature and to the state-senate two years later, making an\r\nexcellent record in both bodies. Butler county nominated him for\r\nCongress, but Lawrence and Mercer combined in favor of J. J. Davidson.\r\nDr. Showalter is a substantial citizen, in close touch with the people\r\nand worthy of the confidence reposed in him. Hon. M. L. Lockwood, for\r\nseven years a resident of Butler, represented Clarion county twice in\r\nthe legislature and introduced the Free-Pipe Bill. Robert Lockwood, the\r\nfounder of the family in America, came from England with Winthrop in\r\n1630. Mr. Lockwood began oil-operations on Cherry Run in 1865, opposed\r\nthe South-Improvement rascality zealously and was a member of the\r\nProducers’ Committee that secured the passage by Congress of the\r\nInterstate-Commerce Bill. He is largely interested in oil and manages a\r\nhundred wells for Tait & Patterson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH B. SHOWALTER.]\r\n\r\nIn the days of oil-shipments by boat and teaming, before the advent of\r\npipe-lines, Watson, Densmore & Co. handled large quantities of crude in\r\nbarrels, hauling it from the wells to the nearest railroad-station.\r\nDaniel T. Watson, senior member of the firm, was born in Maine in 1806,\r\nlearned harness-making, conducted a profitable store in New Hampshire\r\nand came to Oil Creek with James Densmore early in the sixties. He\r\nbought the oil and managed the shipping-business of the firm, which\r\nemployed scores of teams to haul crude from wells at Shamburg and boat\r\nit from wells on the banks of Oil-Creek to the loading-tanks at Miller\r\nFarm. When the railroad reached Boyd Farm the firm opened a branch\r\noffice at Pioneer and shipped east most of the oil produced on Bull,\r\nPioneer and Benninghoff Runs, in the “blue cars” Watson, Densmore & Co.\r\nwere the first to introduce. Clinton Rouderbush, afterwards well known\r\nin the exchanges, represented the firm in New York. Pipe lines ending\r\nprimitive modes of transportation, Mr. Watson operated largely in the\r\nPleasantville field, in connection with Benson & McKelvy, Lewis Emery\r\nand Samuel Q. Brown. He lived two years on the Morrison farm, removed to\r\nMinnesota in 1873 and died at Lakeland on July first, 1894. Mr. Watson\r\nwas prominent in his day and did much to put oil-shipping on a solid\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DANIEL T. WATSON.\r\n  JOEL DENSMORE.\r\n  WILLIAM DENSMORE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES DENSMORE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EMMETT DENSMORE.]\r\n\r\nThe Densmores lived on Woodcock Creek, twenty miles from Titusville,\r\nwhen the Drake well startled the quiet community. The father and his son\r\nAmos visited the well and soon contrived a metal-shoe to fix to a\r\nwooden-pipe to cheapen drilling. Emmett Densmore traversed the\r\noil-region to sell the shoes, often walking forty miles a day. Jonathan\r\nWatson leased him land on the flats below Titusville, Amos had good\r\ncredit and the pair put down a dry-hole with a spring-pole. They leased\r\na piece of ground from James Tarr and drilled the Elephant well, so\r\nnamed from the “monster tank”—twenty-five hundred barrels—Amos\r\nconstructed from pine-planks to hold the great flow of oil. The Elephant\r\nyielded hundreds of barrels daily and the other brothers—James, William\r\nand Joel—were invited to come into the partnership. Amos was given to\r\ninvention and he made bulk-boats, the first tanks for storing crude and\r\nthe first wooden-tanks—forty to fifty barrels each—for platform-cars.\r\nWith Daniel T. Watson they shipped extensively until pipe-lines retired\r\nbarrels, pond-freshets and bulk-boats permanently. The brothers sank\r\nmany wells and acquired wealth. Amos, James and Joel have passed over to\r\nthe better land. Amos and George W. N. Yost, once the largest\r\noil-shipper, perfected the famous Densmore Type-Writer. James bought out\r\nthe Remington Type-Writer. London is Emmett’s home and he has attained\r\nprominence as a physician. His wife, Dr. Helen Densmore, assists in his\r\npractice and has written a book in behalf of Mrs. Maybrick, whose\r\nimprisonment has aroused so much sympathy. William Densmore owns a big\r\nflour-mill and the Central Market at Erie. The Densmores possessed\r\nenergy, genius and manliness that merited the success which rewarded\r\ntheir efforts in various lines of human activity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ISAAC REINEMAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN B. SMITHMAN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T. PRESTON MILLER.]\r\n\r\nThese early shipping-times developed many men of exceptional ability and\r\ncharacter. T. Preston Miller was long a familiar figure on Oil Creek and\r\nat Franklin, as buyer for the Burkes and later for Fisher Brothers.\r\n“Pres” was generous, popular and most accommodating in his dealings. The\r\nsnows of a dozen winters have blown over his grave in the Franklin\r\ncemetery. The late Isaac Reineman was another of Oil City’s trustworthy\r\npioneers. He bought oil, operated in the lower districts with William M.\r\nLeckey, served three terms as prothonotary and died in January, 1893,\r\nfrom the effects of slipping on the icy porch the night before\r\nChristmas. He had charge of Captain Vandergrift’s oil properties in\r\nWashington county and, with Charles Ford, held blocks of land in West\r\nVirginia. Ford was found dead in bed last year. John B. Smithman, who\r\ncame to the Creek to buy oil for John Munhall & Co., has been enriched\r\nby his operations in Venango county and the northern fields. He built a\r\nbeautiful home in Oil City and overcame stacks of obstacles to give the\r\ntown a street railway. He has provided a delightful park four miles down\r\nthe Allegheny, built a steel bridge across the river and positively\r\nrefused to be ruled off the track by any opposing element. “People do\r\nnot kick a corpse.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN EATON.]\r\n\r\nProgression is the unchanging watchword of the petroleum-industry. The\r\nthree-pole derrick of yore has given place to the plank-giant that soars\r\neighty or ninety feet. The spring-pole is a shadowy memory. The first\r\ndrilling-tools weighed ninety-eight pounds; a modern set weighs two\r\ntons. Instead of spending weeks to “kick down” a well a hundred feet, a\r\nthousand feet can be bored between Monday morning and Saturday night.\r\nTen-horse portable engines and boilers are well-nigh forgotten. The\r\nfirst iron-pipe for tubing wells, butt-weld ready to burst on the\r\nslightest provocation, was manufactured in Massachusetts and sold for\r\none dollar per foot. Now lap-weld tubing of the best material brings a\r\ndime a foot. So it is in methods of transportation and refining.\r\nBulk-boats, leaky barrels and long hauls through fathomless mud are\r\nsuperseded by pipe-lines, which pump oil from the wells to New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland and Chicago. The rickety stills and\r\ndangerous devices of former times have yielded to the splendid\r\nrefineries that utilize every vestige of crude and furnish two-hundred\r\nmerchantable commodities. For much of this important advance in tools,\r\nappliances and machinery the great Oil-Well Supply-Company is directly\r\nresponsible. From small beginnings it has grown to dazzling proportions.\r\nIt is the only concern on earth with the facilities and capacity to\r\nmanufacture everything needed to drill and operate oil-wells and\r\nartesian-wells and equip refineries. Its nine enormous plants at\r\nconvenient points employ thousands of skilled workmen and acres of the\r\nlatest machinery. They turn out every conceivable requisite in steel,\r\niron, brass or wood, from engines and complete rigs to the smallest\r\nfittings. John Eaton, the founder and president of the company, may\r\nfairly claim to be the father of the well-supply trade. His connection\r\nwith it dates back to 1861 and has continued ever since. He started\r\nbusiness for himself in 1867 and the next year took up his abode in the\r\noil-region. In 1869 he and E. H. Cole formed the partnership of Eaton &\r\nCole, which the Eaton, Cole & Burnham Company of New York succeeded.\r\nSeveral rival firms organized the Oil-Well Supply Company, Limited, in\r\n1878, with Mr. Eaton at its head. The present corporation succeeded the\r\nLimited Company in 1891. Mr. Eaton’s enterprise and experience are\r\ninvaluable to the company. All new inventions adapted to wells or\r\nrefineries are examined carefully and the most valuable purchased.\r\nBranch-offices and factories have kept pace with the spread of\r\noil-developments. The Company’s wares find a market in every civilized\r\nland. Vice-President Kenton Chickering, first-class clear through,\r\nmanages the large establishment at Oil City. Pittsburg is now Mr.\r\nEaton’s home. He is genial and courteous always, prompt and sagacious in\r\nbusiness, broad in his ideas and true to his convictions, and his\r\nOil-Well Supply-Company is something to be proud of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE KOCH.]\r\n\r\nGeorge Koch, a native of Venango county and relative of the celebrated\r\nDr. Koch of Germany, is a well-known inventor and writer. He began\r\noil-operations in 1865, in 1873 formed a partnership with his brother\r\nand Dr. Knight, in 1880 organized the firm of Koch Brothers—William A.,\r\nJ. H. and George Koch—and was nominated three times for the legislature.\r\nHe took an active part in the Producers’ Council, edited the Fern-City\r\n_Illuminator_ and published a book of “Stray Thoughts.” He invented a\r\ntorpedo for oil-wells, improved drilling-tools and well-appliances,\r\npatented a system of “Sectional Iron Tanks,” a “Rubber-Packing,”\r\n“Movable Store-Shelving” and other useful devices. Mr. Koch has just\r\nrounded the half-century mark, he lives in East Sandy and no man has\r\ndone more to simplify the methods of sinking and operating wells.\r\n\r\nCol. L. H. Fassett is one of the honored veterans of the late war and a\r\nveteran operator in heavy oil. For nearly thirty years he has been a\r\nleader in the Franklin district, operating successfully and enjoying the\r\nesteem of all classes. He has a delightful home, is active in furthering\r\ngood objects and doesn’t worry a particle when oil happens to drop a\r\npeg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COL. L. H. FASSETT.]\r\n\r\nTwelve miles south-east of Pittsburg, on the Bedell farm, near West\r\nElizabeth, the Forest Oil-Company is drilling the deepest well on the\r\ncontinent. It is down fifty-five-hundred feet, considerably more than a\r\nmile, and will be put to six-thousand at least. Geologists and\r\nscientists are much interested in the strata and the temperatures at\r\ndifferent depths. This is the deepest well ever attempted to be sunk\r\nwith a cable, the one near Reibuck, Eastern Silesia, having been bored\r\nabout seven-thousand feet with rotating diamond core-drills. T. S.\r\nKinsey and his two sons, of Wellsburg, drilled a dry-hole\r\nforty-five-hundred feet in 1891, on Boggs’ Run, West Virginia, near\r\nWheeling, for a local company. Think how progress has been marching on\r\nsince Drake’s seventy-foot gopher-hole to render the Forest’s\r\nachievement possible! Surely petroleum-life is as full of promise as a\r\nbill-collector’s.\r\n\r\nHon. Thomas W. Phillips, the wealthy oil-producer, who declined to serve\r\na third term in Congress, labored zealously to secure legislation that\r\nwould settle differences between employers and employés by arbitration.\r\nHe offered to pay a quarter-million dollars to meet the expense of a\r\nthorough Congressional inquiry into the condition of labor, with a view\r\nto the presentation of an authoritative report and the adoption of\r\nmeasures calculated to prevent strikes and promote friendly relations.\r\nWhen the suspension of drilling in the oil-region deprived thousands of\r\nwork for some months, Mr. Phillips was especially active in effecting\r\narrangements by which they received the profits upon two-million barrels\r\nof crude set apart for their benefit. The Standard Oil-Company, always\r\nconsiderate to labor, heartily furthered the plan, which the rise in oil\r\nrendered a signal success. This was the first time in the history of any\r\nbusiness that liberal provision was made for workmen thrown out of\r\nemployment by the stoppage of operations. What a contrast to the\r\ngrinding and squeezing and shooting of miners and coke-workers by\r\n“coal-barons” and “iron-kings!” When you come to size them up the\r\noil-men don’t have to shrink into a hole to avoid close scrutiny. They\r\npay their bills, are just to honest toil, generous to the poor and manly\r\nfrom top to toe. They may not relish rheumatism, but this doesn’t compel\r\nthem to hate the poor fellow it afflicts. As Tiny Tim observed: “God\r\nbless us every one!”\r\n\r\n“Ivry gintleman will soon go horseback on his own taykittle” was the\r\ninspired exclamation of an Irish baronet upon beholding the initial trip\r\nof the first locomotive. Vast improvements in the application of power\r\nhave been effected since Stephenson’s grand triumph, nowhere more\r\nsatisfactorily than in the oil-regions. Producers who remember the\r\nprimitive methods in vogue along Oil Creek can best appreciate the\r\nwonderful progress made during three decades. The tedious process of\r\ndrilling wet-holes with light tools has gone where the woodbine twineth.\r\nCasing has retired the seed-bag permanently, and from the polish-rod to\r\nthe working-barrel not the smallest detail remains unimproved. Having a\r\nportable engine and boiler at each well has given place to the cheaper\r\nplan of coupling a host of wells together, two men thus doing the work\r\nthat once required twenty or thirty. Pipe-lines have superseded greasy\r\nbarrels and swearing teamsters, and even tank-cars are following the\r\nflat-boats of pioneer times to oblivion. In short, labor-saving systems\r\nhave revolutionized the business so completely that the fathers of the\r\nearly styles would utterly fail to recognize their offspring in the\r\npetroleum-development as conducted now-a-days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUSTABOUTS PREPARING TO CLEAN OUT A RUSSIAN OIL-WELL.]\r\n\r\nC. L. Wheeler, one of the earliest buyers of crude on Oil Creek in 1860\r\nand first President of the Bradford Oil-Exchange, recently went to his\r\neternal reward. Orion Clemens, brother of Mark Twain and once a writer\r\nfor the Oil-City _Derrick_, died lately. Truly, the boys are “crossing\r\nthe divide” at a rate it grieves the survivors to note.\r\n\r\nThe fine illustrations of oil-scenes in Russia are from the collection\r\nof photographs gathered by John Eaton, President of the Oil-Well Supply\r\nCompany, during his visits to the dominions of the Czar. “Long may he\r\nwave!”\r\n\r\n                          Crude sixty-five,\r\n                          Well, sakes alive!\r\n                          You seek rich spoil?\r\n                          Don’t bore for oil.\r\n                          ’Mid Klondyke snow\r\n                          You have more show\r\n                          To score a hit\r\n                          And save a bit.\r\n\r\nSix-thousand wells drilled and ninety-six-thousand barrels of production\r\nper day represent oil-operations in Pennsylvania in 1897. To this\r\nenormous output Ohio and Indiana added fifty-three-thousand barrels a\r\nday and thirty-six-hundred wells.\r\n\r\nTo the indefatigable zeal and liberality of Rev. Thomas Carroll, for\r\ntwenty-five years in charge of the parish, Oil City owes the erection of\r\nthe finest church in Northwestern Pennsylvania. The beautiful edifice\r\nfitly crowns the summit of Cottage Hill. Its two lofty spires point\r\nheavenward and its altar is a marvel of exquisite taste and finish. An\r\nelegant parsonage stands on the adjacent lot, with the parochial school\r\nacross the street. It is proposed to rebuild the schools, to supply a\r\nlarge hall and a convent and to provide every convenience for the\r\nvarious societies connected with the grand congregation. This idea is\r\nrendered possible by the splendid offer of Father Carroll to pay\r\none-half the entire cost himself. The good work he has done for\r\ntemperance, education, morality and religion cannot be estimated. He is\r\ndistinguished by his catholic spirit, his broad charity, his unwearied\r\nphilanthropy and his unswerving devotion to the right. No man has made a\r\ndeeper, nobler impress upon any community in the oil-regions than the\r\nbeloved pastor of St. Joseph’s. “Late may he return to Heaven!”\r\n\r\n            “Each man makes his own stature, builds himself;\r\n            Virtue alone outbuilds the Pyramids;\r\n            Her monuments shall last when Egypt’s fall.”\r\n\r\nA host of changes, some pleasing and more unutterably sad, have the\r\nswift seasons brought. The scene of active operations has shifted often.\r\nThe great Bradford region and the rich fields around Pittsburg and\r\nButler have had their innings. Parker, Petrolia, St. Petersburg,\r\nMillerstown and Greece City have followed Plumer, Shaffer, Pioneer,\r\nRed-Hot and Oleopolis to the limbo of forsaken things. Petroleum Centre\r\nis a memory only. Rouseville is reduced to a skeleton. Not a trace of\r\nAntwerp, or Pickwick, or Triangle is left. Enterprise resembles\r\nGoldsmith’s “Deserted Village,” or Ossian’s “Balaclutha.” Tip-Top,\r\nModoc, Troutman, Turkey City, St. Joe, Shamburg, Edenburg and Buena\r\nVista have had their rise and fall. Fagundas has vanished. Pleasantville\r\nfails to draw an army of adventurous seekers for oleaginous wealth.\r\nTidioute is an echo of the past and scores of minor towns have\r\ndisappeared completely. For forms and faces once familiar one looks in\r\nvain. Where are the plucky operators who for a half-score years made Oil\r\nCreek the briskest, gayest, liveliest spot in America? Thousands are\r\nbrowsing in pastures elsewhere, while other thousands have crossed the\r\nbridgeless river which flows into the ocean of eternity.\r\n\r\nAlas for sentiment! Nero proves to have been a humanitarian, a good man\r\nwho was merely a bad fiddler. Henry the Eighth turns out to be a model\r\nhusband, rather unfortunate in the loss of wives, but sweetly indulgent\r\nand only a trifle given to fall in love with pretty girls. William Tell\r\nhad no son and shot no arrow at an apple on young Tell’s head. Now\r\nCharlotte Temple is a myth, the creation of an English novelist, with\r\nher name cut on a flat tombstone in Trinity Churchyard over a grave\r\nwhich originally bore a metal-plate supposed to commemorate a man! At\r\nthis rate some historic sharp in the future may demonstrate that the\r\noil-men were a race of green-tinted people governed by King Petroleum.\r\nColonel Drake may be pronounced a figure of the imagination, the\r\nStandard a fiction, the South-Improvement Company a nightmare and the\r\nProducers’ Association a dream. Then some inquisitive antiquarian may\r\ncome across a copy of “Sketches in Crude-Oil” stored in a forgotten\r\ncorner of the Congressional library, and set them all right and keep the\r\nworld running in the correct groove with regard to the grand industry of\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n                     “I stood upon Achilles’ tomb\r\n           And heard Troy doubted: time will doubt of Rome.”\r\n\r\nA dry-joke tickles and a dry-hole scrunches. It’s a poor mule won’t work\r\nboth ways, a poor spouter that can’t keep its owner from going up the\r\nspout, a poor boil in the pot that isn’t better than a boil on the neck,\r\na poor chestnut on the tree that doesn’t beat a chestnut at a minstrel\r\nshow and a poor seed that produces no root or herb or grain or fruit or\r\nflower. “Who made you?” the Sunday-school teacher asked a ragged urchin.\r\n“Made me? Well, God made me a foot long and I growed the rest!” And so\r\nthe early operators on Oil Creek made the oil-development “a foot long”\r\nand it “growed the rest.” The tiny seed is a vigorous plant, the puling\r\nbabe a lusty giant. Amid lights and shadows, clouds and sunshine,\r\nsuccesses and failures, struggles and triumphs, starless nights and\r\nradiant days, petroleum has moved ahead steadily. Growth, “creation by\r\nlaw,” is ever going on in the healthy plant, the tree, the animal, the\r\nmind, the universe. We must go forward if the acorn is to become an oak,\r\nthe infant a mature man, the feeble industry a sturdy development.\r\nProgress implies more of _in_volution than of _e_volution, just as the\r\noak contains much that was not in the acorn, and the oil-business in\r\n1898 possesses elements unknown in 1859. Not to advance is to go\r\nbackward in religion, in nature and in trade. “An absentee God, sitting\r\nidle ever since the first Sabbath, on the outside of the universe, and\r\n_seeing_ it go,” is not a correct idea of the All-Wise Being, working\r\nactively in every point of space and moment of time. Stagnation means\r\ndecay in the natural world and death in oil-affairs. The man who sits in\r\nthe pasture waiting for the cow to come and be milked will never skim\r\noff the cream. The man who wants to figure as an oil-operator must\r\nbounce the drill and tap the sand and give the stuff a chance to get\r\ninto the tanks. Still a youngster in years, the petroleum-colt has\r\ndistanced the old nags. The sucker-rod is the pole that knocks the\r\npersimmons. The oil-well is the fountain of universal illumination. The\r\nwalking-beam is the real balance of trade and of power. The derrick is\r\nthe badge of enlightenment. Petroleum is the bright star that shines for\r\nall mankind and doesn’t propose to be snuffed out or shoved off the\r\ngrass. Its past is known, its present may be estimated, but what Canute\r\ndare fence in its future and say: “Thus far shalt thou come and no\r\nfarther?”\r\n\r\n     If there be friendly readers, as they reckon up the score,\r\n     Who find these random “Sketches” not a burden and a bore\r\n     Too heavy for digestion and too light for solemn lore—\r\n     Who find a grain of pleasure has been added to their store\r\n     By some glad reminiscence of the palmy days of yore,\r\n     Or tender recollection of the old friends gone before—\r\n     Who find some things to cherish and but little to deplore—\r\n     Good-bye, our voyage ended, we must anchor on the shore.\r\n     The last line has been written, all the labor now is o’er,\r\n     The task has had sweet relish from the surface to the core;\r\n     The sand-rock is exhausted, for the oil has drain’d each pore,\r\n     The derrick stands neglected and we cease to tread its floor;\r\n     My feet are on the threshold and my hands are on the door—\r\n     The pen falls from my fingers, to be taken up no more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The End]\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Transcriber’s Note\r\n\r\nThe hyphenation of compound words can be variable.
