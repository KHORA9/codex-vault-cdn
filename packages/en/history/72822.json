Here on May 27 of the\r\nsame year the boy was born. In his early childhood he displayed that\r\nmental ability which does not always fulfill its promise in years of\r\nmaturity. He was able to translate Homer at the age of seven and\r\ngenerally preferred books to rude outdoor sports. He displayed musical\r\ntendencies, too, learning to play the organ and to sing in the choir;\r\nbut no special attention was given to his musical training, probably\r\nbecause his facility in this art was regarded as only an evidence of his\r\ngeneral activity of mind. He was first put to school at the Würtemberg\r\nInstitute, and after a thorough preparation there, was sent to the\r\nSchwyz Jesuit Lyceum. He was graduated with distinction, carrying off\r\nprizes in Latin and mathematics, but his means were not sufficient to\r\nenable him to take a university course. He obtained the post of tutor of\r\nLatin at St. Gallen, where he remained a short time, afterward going as\r\na teacher to Rapperswyl. He was at this time hardly twenty years of age.\r\nHe now began his study of music, for which his fondness had been\r\ngrowing. He was unable to afford a teacher, but he diligently practised\r\nat the piano and made many earnest attempts at composition.\r\n\r\nThe patron saint of musical Germany in 1842 was Mendelssohn and in\r\nAugust of that year he set off on one of his tours in Switzerland. No\r\ndate is recorded, but we may be sure that Raff seized upon this visit as\r\nhis opportunity. Mendelssohn, with his customary promptness in\r\nrecognizing and assisting aspirants, gave the young man a warm letter of\r\nrecommendation to the great publishing house of Breitkopf & Härtel. So\r\neffective were the master’s words that Raff’s first work was published\r\nin January, 1843. Thenceforward the current of his life could not be\r\nchecked, and despite the opposition of his parents, he devoted his\r\nfuture to music. No critical notice of Raff’s opus 1 has been found, but\r\nopus 2 (“Trois Pièces Caracteristique” for piano) is mentioned with\r\nkindness in Schumann’s journal, the _Neue Zeitschrift für Musik_, of\r\nAug. 5, 1844. The critic found in the composition “something which\r\npoints to a future for the composer.” One readily discerns here the keen\r\ninsight of the greatest of all music critics, Schumann himself.\r\nFavorable comments were made on the young composer’s works numbered opus\r\n2 to 6 in the _Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung_ of Aug. 21 in the same\r\nyear, and we may readily understand that with such encouragements Raff\r\nbent his whole mind to the production of music.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 the wizard Liszt appeared in Switzerland. The great pianist was\r\nnot long in discovering Raff’s gifts and was equally quick to see that\r\nthe young man was struggling against privations that would have\r\noverwhelmed a weaker nature. Liszt invited Raff to accompany him on a\r\nconcert tour, and thus laid the foundations of the beginner’s\r\nreputation. Together they travelled in the principal German cities, the\r\ntour ending at Cologne. Thence Liszt returned to Paris, but Raff\r\nremained. This stay in Cologne was a happy one, for it led to a personal\r\nacquaintance with Mendelssohn. The famous master, who had given the\r\nyoung composer his first help, now displayed fresh interest in him and\r\nmade him a proposition to go to Leipsic and continue his studies under\r\nMendelssohn’s own guidance. Such an offer was not to be refused, but the\r\nfates were not propitious. Just as Raff was making his preparations to\r\ngo to Leipsic in the fall of 1847 Mendelssohn’s untimely death put an\r\nend to his hopes. He had not been idle while in Cologne, however, for he\r\nhad studied composition with great earnestness, and had sent to the\r\n_Cäcilia_, published in Berlin by the noted contrapuntist, Siegfried\r\nDehn, many contributions displaying wide knowledge of musical science.\r\nLater he published “Die Wagnerfrage” (“The Wagner Question”), a pamphlet\r\nwhich attracted much attention, as did all discussions of the works of\r\nthe Bayreuth genius.\r\n\r\nRaff now became anxious to make a permanent home for himself in one of\r\nthe larger German cities. He appealed once more to Liszt, who gave him a\r\nletter of introduction to Mechetti, at that time a prominent publisher\r\nof Vienna. It seemed as if ill luck relentlessly pursued Raff, for while\r\nhe was actually on the way to visit Mechetti, the latter died. In spite\r\nof such obstacles to his advancement the composer continued his labors\r\nwith undaunted spirit. He returned to his old home at Würtemberg and\r\nresumed his studies. For a short time he taught and studied at\r\nStuttgart, seeking in the latter city to fill the gaps in his early\r\ntraining. That his ambition was unconquered is well proved by the fact\r\nthat in Stuttgart he wrote his first large work, an opera in four acts\r\nentitled “King Alfred.” In Stuttgart, too, he was in some measure\r\nrecompensed for his many trials and adversities by making the\r\nacquaintance of one who was destined to be his life-long friend and his\r\nchampion after death. This was Hans von Bülow, then a youth of barely\r\ntwenty, not yet the famous pupil of Liszt, but a law student who was\r\nneglecting his studies for the pursuit of music. Von Bülow, no doubt,\r\nperceived that to introduce to the public a new composer of merit would\r\nadd to his own success as a player, and he accordingly performed from\r\nmemory a recently finished composition of Raff’s, which he had seen for\r\nthe first time two days before. The result was a storm of applause for\r\nboth player and composer. This success cemented the friendship of the\r\ntwo, and, as all who have often heard the pianist well know, Dr. von\r\nBülow very rarely plays a miscellaneous programme on which the name of\r\nRaff does not appear.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1850 that the young man met Liszt again, this time in Hamburg,\r\nand followed the magnet of attraction to Weimar. Here at last it seemed\r\nas if Raff had found the atmosphere for which his spirit hungered.\r\nMusic, literature and art permeated the air; and the foreign artists who\r\ncame to lay their tributes of flattery before the throne of the musical\r\nidol of the hour had smiles of approval for Raff, who basked in the\r\nsunlight and let the essence of the new German ideas in music saturate\r\nhis soul. He went to work with renewed vigor, and inspired by the\r\npresence of competent performers wrote his first chamber music (Quatuor\r\nNo. 1 in D minor for strings), some of his best piano suites, his\r\nsetting of Geibel’s “Traum König und Sein Lieb” (“Dream King and his\r\nLove”), “Wachet auf” and other well known works. Raff made himself\r\npopular and respected in the artistic circles of Weimar by his learning.\r\nWhen Berlioz, who was ignorant of German, was there and a banquet was\r\ngiven in his honor, Raff relieved the situation of some difficulty by\r\nmaking the address to the guest in Latin, an attention which highly\r\ndelighted the Frenchman.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Raff had found his domestic fate in Doris Genast, an\r\nactress, grand-daughter of Goethe’s favorite actor. This young lady\r\nhaving accepted an engagement in Wiesbaden, the composer followed her\r\nthither in 1856. He speedily became the most popular music teacher in\r\nthe city, but his compositions still failed to find a ready market.\r\nNevertheless he employed his spare hours unceasingly in writing. In 1859\r\nhe and Fräulein Genast were married, and a daughter was the result of\r\ntheir union. Previous to his marriage he composed in 1858 his second\r\nviolin sonata and the incidental music to “Bernhard von Weimar,” a drama\r\nby Wilhelm Genast. The overture to this drama became a favorite and was\r\nplayed frequently in many parts of Germany. In the summer of 1859,\r\nhowever, he began the work which was to establish his fame. This was his\r\nfirst symphony, “In the Fatherland.” It was ready for the publisher in\r\n1861, when the composer was informed of the prize offered by the\r\n“Society of the Friends of Music of the Austrian Empire” (“Gesellschaft\r\nder Musikfreunde”), for the best symphony offered in competition. Raff\r\nsent in his new work, and in 1863 a committee consisting of Ferdinand\r\nHiller, Carl Reinecke, Dr. Ambros, Robert Volkmann and Vincenz Lachner\r\nadjudged it the best of thirty-two compositions. Other large works\r\nfollowed, and their success enabled him to give up teaching to devote\r\nhimself wholly to composing. No artist’s life shows more plainly than\r\nRaff’s the result of escape from poverty’s iron control. Hitherto he had\r\nwritten copiously for the drawing-room, but now he sought to produce\r\nworks wholly artistic in purpose. His retirement after the beginning of\r\nthe year 1870 was almost idyllic, being broken only by the visits of\r\nfellow artists. It is impossible to agree with the oft-repeated\r\nstatement that his best works date from this period, for the beautiful\r\n“Im Walde” (“In the Forest”) symphony appeared in 1869; but there is\r\nevery proof of a higher purpose in the compositions after 1870 than in\r\nthe majority of those originating earlier than that year. Perhaps, too,\r\nRaff’s lack of business ability may be accepted as an evidence of his\r\nartistic sincerity. For his first, second and fourth symphonies he\r\nreceived no cash payment; for the third (“Im Walde”) he got sixty\r\nthalers, the same amount being paid him again, when the work was sold to\r\na French publisher. Thereafter, however, he seems to have acquired\r\ncourage enough to ask fair prices for his works.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Raff left Wiesbaden to become director of the new Conservatory\r\nof Music at Frankfort. He taught composition himself, arranged the\r\nlibrary, and conducted the institution upon such a broad-minded plan\r\nthat its success was assured from the beginning. He continued his labors\r\nin composition, his symphonies after the seventh, having been written at\r\nFrankfort together with other important works. Ignorant of the fact that\r\na mortal disease had fastened upon him he worked with undiminished zeal\r\ntill 1882, when on the night of June 24, heart disease ended his career.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph letter from Raff to a personal friend.\r\n]\r\n\r\nRaff’s principal works are the following: operas—“King Alfred,” Weimar,\r\n1850; “Dame Kobold,” (comic) Weimar, 1870; “Benedetto Marcello,”\r\n(lyric), not performed; “Samson” (opera seria), not performed.\r\n\r\nFor voices and orchestra—“Wachet Auf” (“Be on Guard”), opus 80;\r\n“Deutschland’s Auferstehung” (“Germany’s Resurrection”), opus 100;\r\nfestival cantata for the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of Leipsic;\r\n“De Profundis” (Psalm CXXX.) for eight voices and orchestra, opus 141;\r\nand “Morgenlied” (“Morning Song”), for mixed chorus and orchestra, opus\r\n171.\r\n\r\nFor orchestra: symphonies—“In the Fatherland,” opus 96; No. 2, in C,\r\nopus 140; No. 3, “Im Walde,” in F, opus 153; No. 4, in G minor, opus\r\n167; No. 5, “Lenore,” in E, opus 177; No. 6, in D minor, opus 189; No.\r\n7, “In den Alpen,” B flat, opus 201; No. 8, “Frühlingsklänge,” (“Sounds\r\nof Spring”) in A, opus 205; No. 9, “Im Sommer” (“In the Summer”) in E\r\nminor, opus 208; No. 10, “Im Herbstzeit” (“In Autumn”), F minor, opus\r\n213; No. 11, “Der Winter,” A minor, opus 214; four suites in C, F, E\r\nminor and B flat; and nine overtures, including those to “Romeo and\r\nJuliet,” “Othello,” “Macbeth” and the “Tempest.”\r\n\r\nFor piano with orchestra—“Ode to Spring,” opus 76; concerto in C minor,\r\nopus 185; and suite in E flat, opus 200.\r\n\r\nFor violin with orchestra—concerto No. 1 in B minor, opus 161; concerto\r\nNo. 2, in A minor, opus 206.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these principal works there is a great mass of chamber\r\nmusic, piano compositions, songs and ’cello pieces.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be unfortunate for Raff’s fame that his dramatic works\r\nare unknown in this country, though it is indisputable that none of them\r\nhas achieved high repute in German. It is probable, although we in\r\nAmerica know far less about the music of this gifted man than the\r\nGermans do, the estimate of his abilities generally accepted on this\r\nside of the Atlantic is a wise one. He is regarded as a composer who,\r\npossessing exceptional fecundity of melodic invention and rare mastery\r\nof orchestral tone-color, sought to impose upon music a definiteness of\r\nexpression somewhat beyond its power. This eagerness to delineate in\r\ndetail a chain of feelings or impressions led Raff into diffuseness of\r\nstyle and to frequent sacrifices of those formal elaborations which are\r\nregarded as essential to the construction of artistic music. He has been\r\ngenerally thought to lack self-criticism and a want of restraint\r\nresulting therefrom; but it has always seemed to the present writer that\r\nRaff’s errors were not in the direction of criticism, but of fundamental\r\nbelief. In other words he let the beautiful vision of a genus of\r\npictorial programme music which is to be more expressive than speech run\r\naway with his reason. The preface to his “In the Fatherland” symphony\r\nclearly exhibits his idea of the possibilities of music.\r\n\r\nNow it is neither necessary nor expedient to repeat here any of the\r\nfamiliar discussion as to the expressive power of music. The most\r\nserious thinkers about the art, even when they disagree in details, are\r\ngenerally of the opinion that music can express only the broader\r\nemotions, and requires text to make clear the cause of the feelings. We\r\nare able to get great pleasure, and at times genuine emotional\r\nexaltation from the music of Raff provided we are willing to approach it\r\nin the only fair spirit in which programme music can be approached—that\r\nof willingness to accept the composer’s premises. The first movement of\r\nthe “Fatherland” symphony has strength and aspiration, and we have only\r\nto accept Raff’s explanation that he is singing of Germany to enter into\r\nthe heart of his composition. In the same way we are obliged to approach\r\nthe “Lenore,” the “Im Walde” and his other symphonies. The grisly story\r\nof Burger’s “Lenore” is told in detail in the finale of the symphony,\r\nbut in order to follow the music we need the poem. Having that, we\r\nperceive the aptness and peculiar fitness of the composer’s rhythmic and\r\nmelodic fancies. Nothing could have a more stimulating effect upon the\r\nimagination—once the key to the secret is possessed—than the inexorable\r\npersistence of the groups of a quaver and two semi-quavers by which the\r\ninfernal flight of the lovers is indicated. If perchance we find an\r\ninstrumental representation of a gallop not new (it having been invented\r\nby Claudio Monteverde in the beginning of the seventeenth century) we\r\ncan at any rate get all the effect designed by Raff in his woodwind\r\nshrieks of the nightbirds and his trombone hymn for the dead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph manuscript of an “Album Leaf” by Raff.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe has achieved a greater fidelity of feeling and a subtler realism of\r\ntones, however, in his “Im Walde,” which is generally looked upon as his\r\nmasterpiece. The first movement is intended to bring to the hearer’s\r\nmind the woods in the sunlit beauty of noon. The second reveals them to\r\nus in the suggestive shadow of twilight. In the third movement the\r\ncomposer entertains us with an airy and delicate dance of Dryads, a\r\nwoodland scherzo in deed and in truth. In the fourth and last movement\r\nwe have a musical embodiment of the familiar German legend of the Wild\r\nHuntsman. A gentle fugal thought pictures the repose of the woods.\r\nSuddenly the rhythm of the galloping hunt is heard, as it were, in the\r\ndistance. Nearer and nearer it comes, till the whole orchestra thunders\r\nwith its riotous fury. It dies away in the distance, returns and dies\r\naway again. Then comes the glory of sunrise. This symphony makes less\r\ndemands in the way of preparation than many of Raff’s other works. The\r\nsingle suggestion that he is painting the forest and that there is a\r\nwild hunt is all that the imagination needs to give it complete\r\nenjoyment of this work. Freedom of form is a natural result of the kind\r\nof composition in which Raff excelled and his ability to write quickly\r\nand with little effort prevented his feeling the necessity of working\r\nout his compositions with the care and science of the classical school.\r\nOne gets much less intellectual satisfaction, therefore, out of Raff’s\r\nwork than out of Schumann’s, who was his precursor, and still less than\r\nout of Mozart’s. But the ear and the imagination are delighted by the\r\nclear intelligibility of his melodic ideas, their unfailing poetic\r\nsentiment and musical grace. It is these qualities of his themes,\r\ntogether with the splendid colors in which his orchestral palette is so\r\nrich, that have given to his symphonic works their wide popularity, and\r\nhave made the name of Raff recognized as that of one of the really\r\ngifted followers of the romantic school founded by Schumann and\r\nSchubert. In the general outline his symphonies follow the laws of the\r\nearlier masters, notably in the distribution of the movements. His\r\nseparate movements, however, are not always built according to the old\r\nrules, his finales being notably free and irregular. It can only be\r\nsaid, then, in concluding this brief estimate of his symphonic writing,\r\nthat his works in the large orchestral form are admirable examples of\r\nthat class of modern composition in which structural skill and\r\nscientific development are sacrificed to warmth of sentiment and\r\nopulence of color. In a word, they belong to what may be called the\r\nimpressionist school of music.\r\n\r\nLest it be supposed that Raff was deficient in musical learning, let us\r\nnote that his chamber music, always melodious and graceful, frequently\r\ndisplays profound mastery of the resources of his art. His sextet in G\r\nminor, opus 178, deserves especial mention because it is one of his most\r\ncarefully written productions. It is written for two violins, two violas\r\nand two ’cellos in six real parts, and every trick of canon and\r\nimitation is introduced. One commentator enthusiastically describes it\r\nas “a veritable triumph of counterpoint.” In his treatment of the first\r\nsubject of his “In the Fatherland” symphony, too, he writes a canon in\r\naugmentation and double augmentation that would have delighted the eye\r\nof Bach himself. Dr. Franz Gehring, of Vienna, in his article on Raff in\r\nGrove’s “Dictionary of Music” calls attention to the interesting fact\r\nthat “in the pianoforte concerto in C minor (opus 185) in each movement\r\nall the subjects are in double counterpoint with one another, yet this\r\nis one of Raff’s freshest and most melodious works.” The composer’s\r\npiano music is very popular, and some of it, notably the variations on\r\nan original theme (opus 179) and most of the suites, is remarkable for\r\nits fertility of resource as well as for the composer’s usual readiness\r\nfor the production of new melodies. His songs are equally rich in\r\ntunefulness and many of them have attained the rare distinction of\r\nbecoming the common property of the German people.\r\n\r\nRaff may not deserve a seat among the Titans of music. Yet his\r\noriginality, his grace of thought and his oriental gorgeousness of\r\nutterance lift him above the level of mediocrity and stamp him as a man\r\npossessed of rare and valuable gifts. His larger works show every\r\nevidence of artistic earnestness, and had he been less imbued with\r\nimpressionistic ideas and more free from the burdens of poverty, he\r\nmight have attained perfection of art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: N. J. Henderson.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHANNES BRAHMS\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a triplex photograph from life, made in 1889 by\r\n    Brasch._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                            JOHANNES BRAHMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spirit of modern civilization is preëminently a critical one. A vast\r\namount of knowledge and talent is constantly put in its service and it\r\nseems as though education had no higher purpose than to enable man to\r\nbecome as early as possible a critic of everything offered for material\r\nor spiritual use or enjoyment. In no field have these tendencies become\r\nmore conspicuous than in the most delicate and complicated art of music.\r\nOur generation is brought up not so much for a life-long devotion, study\r\nand true appreciation, as for a most premature forming and uttering of\r\nopinions as to the merits, and particularly the shortcomings, of any\r\nproduction. Most of our critics, too, work in this wrong direction,\r\ninstead of preaching that modesty and prudence and earnest devotion\r\nwhich alone enables us to become familiar with new talent or works of a\r\nhigher order. Goethe accuses critics in general, that they have the\r\nhabit of ignoring really great things and of showing an unusual interest\r\nin mediocrity. He ascribes to them a bad influence upon creative\r\nartists, saying that these can only follow the path dictated by their\r\nnature, while arrogant criticism, which assumes to prescribe to them how\r\nto do or not to do a thing, may destroy them. He doubts whether in\r\nmodern England, with the criticising daily press, such an astounding\r\nappearance as that of a Shakespeare would be possible, and, as an\r\nexpert, declares that great things can be accomplished only in a state\r\nof absolutely undisturbed, innocent, almost somnambulistic creation,\r\nattained by complete isolation. That such self-chosen isolation, resting\r\nupon a strong personal and artistic character, yet combined with a\r\nhearty interest in all human concerns and the most comprehensive general\r\nculture, is possible, even in our modern time, and that it can be\r\ncrowned with most wonderful results, is splendidly shown by the career\r\nof Johannes Brahms, whose greatness rests mainly on this unswerving\r\nfidelity to his genius in spite of all adverse criticism during the\r\nyears of his development and attained mastership.\r\n\r\nHe was born in Hamburg, May 7th, 1833, being the eldest of three\r\nchildren of Johann Brahms, a remarkable musician, who played double bass\r\nat the theatre, and Christiane Nissen, a lady of an affectionate, noble\r\ncharacter. There was never a doubt as to his becoming a musician. Under\r\nthe instruction first of O. Cossel and, from his tenth year, of Eduard\r\nMarxsen, a most thorough musician and excellent teacher in the sister\r\ncity Altona, the boy made rapid progress on the piano. Marxsen soon\r\nbegan also to give him theoretical instruction and was at once attracted\r\nby the rare keenness of the intellect of his pupil. Indeed, in his first\r\nproductions he recognized a spirit which convinced him of a profound\r\nlatent talent. He therefore spared no effort to awaken and guide this\r\ntalent that his pupil might become another priest of art to “preach in a\r\nnew way what is high, true and imperishable.”\r\n\r\nAs a lad of fourteen Brahms played for the first time in public, pieces\r\nof his favorite masters, Bach and Beethoven, and original variations on\r\na folk-song, thus showing an early liking not only for popular melodies,\r\nbut for a musical form which he has cultivated more assiduously and for\r\nhigher purposes than any other modern composer. Indeed this combination\r\nof popular elements with most artistic and complicated forms has perhaps\r\nremained the most characteristic feature of Brahms’ music.\r\n\r\nAfter giving a few other concerts, Marxsen kept him for several years\r\nfrom appearing in public, until in 1853 he could send him as a master of\r\nhis instrument upon his first journey with the Hungarian violin virtuoso\r\nRemenyi. In Hanover, where he played much before the king, he met\r\nJoachim, who became his life-long friend, and Joachim was especially\r\nimpressed when Brahms, in one of these concerts with Remenyi, transposed\r\non account of the low pitch of the piano, without any preparation and\r\neven without notes, a Beethoven violin sonata, raising it a semitone.\r\nMarxsen was not surprised; for years Brahms had been accustomed to\r\ntranspose great pieces at sight into any key, and so astonishing was his\r\nmemory, that he never carried notes with him upon a concert trip. The\r\ncompositions of Beethoven and Bach and a long list of modern concert\r\npieces were safely committed to memory by him. Brahms remained several\r\nweeks in Weimar as the guest of Liszt, who delighted in playing the\r\nyoung composer’s manuscripts. Then he parted from Remenyi and went with\r\nJoachim’s recommendation to Robert Schumann in Düsseldorf. The\r\nimpression which his personality, playing, and works made upon the\r\nlatter was profound. Nothing in his later career, rich in honors and\r\ntriumphs, can be dearer to his memory than the enthusiastic greeting\r\nwith which Schumann introduced him to the musical world.\r\n\r\nWithout some citation from an oft-reprinted article in the “Neue\r\nZeitschrift für Musik” no sketch of Brahms’ life is complete. Schumann\r\ngreets him as the one whom he had expected to appear to utter the\r\nhighest ideal expression of his times, claiming the mastership not by a\r\ngradual development, but appearing suddenly before us fully equipped as\r\nMinerva sprang from the brain of Jupiter. “And he has come, a youth at\r\nwhose cradle graces and heroes kept watch.” “Sitting at the piano he\r\nbegan to unveil wonderful regions. We were drawn into more and more\r\nmagical circles by his playing, full of genius, which made of the piano\r\nan orchestra of lamenting and jubilant voices. There were sonatas, or\r\nrather veiled symphonies; songs, whose poetry might be understood\r\nwithout words; piano pieces both of a demoniac nature and of the most\r\ngraceful form; sonatas for violin and piano—string quartets—each so\r\ndifferent from every other, that they seemed to flow from many different\r\nsprings.” “Whenever he bends his magic wand, there, when the powers of\r\norchestra and chorus lend him their aid, further glimpses of the ideal\r\nworld will be revealed to us. May the highest genius strengthen him;\r\nmeanwhile the spirit of modesty dwells within him. His comrades greet\r\nhim at his first step into the world of art, where wounds may perhaps\r\nawait him, but bay and laurel also; we welcome him as a valiant\r\nwarrior.”\r\n\r\nThis cordial introduction created quite a sensation, yet it was by no\r\nmeans a guaranty of an enthusiastic reception of the young composer’s\r\nworks. For, far from being an imitator of Schumann’s style, he appeared\r\nat once in his own strong personality and as a stranger, who even in\r\nLeipsic was not understood. Yet he found publishers for three pianoforte\r\nsonatas, a scherzo, a trio and several songs. For years the interest in\r\nhim was confined to a small circle. He stayed for a while in Hanover,\r\nmaking from there several concert tours with Joachim or Stockhausen, the\r\ngreat singer, another devoted friend, visiting also Schumann in his\r\nretreat in the Endenich hospital. In his variations on a theme from\r\nSchumann’s Op. 99, he gave a touching expression to his sympathy with\r\nthe master’s sufferings. After the publication of these and the ballads\r\nOp. 10, Brahms devoted several years to profound study. Schumann’s\r\npraise had not spoiled him, nor was he discouraged by the lack of\r\nsuccess. For a few seasons he was the director of the orchestra and\r\nchorus in Detmold, spending also some time in Hamburg and in travelling.\r\nMeanwhile he finished many songs and choruses, two serenades for\r\norchestra, and two sextets. In Jan., 1859, he played in Leipsic his\r\nfirst great pianoforte concerto; most of the criticisms thereon were,\r\nhowever, such as to now excite our mirth. It was in Switzerland and\r\nVienna that his genius found a sincere recognition. About thirty years\r\nago the writer first saw Brahms in his Swiss home; at that time he was\r\nof a rather delicate slim-looking figure, with a beardless face of ideal\r\nexpression. Since then he has changed in appearance, until now he looks\r\nthe very image of health, being stout and muscular, the noble, manly\r\nface surrounded by a full gray beard. The writer well remembers singing\r\nunder his direction, watching him conduct orchestra rehearsals, hearing\r\nhim play alone or with orchestra, listening to an after-dinner speech or\r\nprivate conversation, observing him when attentively listening to other\r\nworks, and seeing the modest smile with which he accepted, or rather\r\ndeclined, expressions of admiration.\r\n\r\nThe Alpine summits and glaciers had great attractions for Brahms, but\r\nalso the welcome which he was always sure to find in Basel and Zürich.\r\nFor his permanent home he selected Vienna, in 1862, where he was\r\nsurrounded by the spirits of the classic masters. He was received most\r\nfavorably. His interpretation of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann\r\nwas particularly praised. He was appointed chorus master of the\r\nSing-Academie for a season, and prepared a memorable performance of\r\nBach’s Passion Music. Yet his genius would not allow him to devote much\r\ntime to such services, and once only in later years he accepted a\r\nsimilar appointment, directing from 1872–1875 the concerts of the\r\n“Society of the Friends of Music.” Aside from this all his time was\r\ndevoted to composing, interrupted only by frequent journeys to\r\nperformances of his works, and by giving valuable assistance in the\r\nrevision of the works of Couperin, Mozart and Chopin. During the first\r\nyears of his residence in Vienna he finished many important chamber\r\nworks, variations, waltzes and Hungarian dances for the pianoforte, and\r\nvocal compositions of every kind. The first great success was won by the\r\n“German Requiem,” begun after the death of his mother in 1866, and\r\ncompleted, for the greater part, in Switzerland, in the two following\r\nyears. After the first famous performance in the Bremen Cathedral in the\r\nspring of 1868, it was soon heard in other cities and was greatly\r\nadmired, although certain features were severely criticised. Other works\r\nof high importance followed: the “Song of Destiny,” “Rinaldo,” the\r\n“Rhapsody,” Op. 53, the “Song of Triumph” for the celebration of the\r\nhappy ending of the Franco-German war, besides many songs, chamber\r\nworks, and the charming Love-Song Waltzes. By all these works Brahms\r\nrose gradually higher and higher in the general estimation both at home\r\nand abroad. But he steadfastly avoided the one field in the reform of\r\nwhich all musical interest seemed to centre,—the opera. Perhaps the time\r\nwill come when we may be fully informed as to his relation to dramatic\r\nmusic and the reasons which kept him away from the stage. Much might be\r\nguessed. But it is needless to pay attention to mere rumors and\r\nsuppositions. There were other fields in which he was called upon to\r\nachieve great things. Nothing shows better the greatness of Brahms’\r\nartistic character than the fact that, in spite of Schumann’s prophecy\r\nand many early instrumental masterpieces, he waited with his first\r\nsymphony until he was a man of over forty years. Four great symphonies\r\nhave appeared between 1876 and 1885, preceded by orchestral variations\r\non a theme of Haydn; also, during the same time, two overtures, a second\r\npianoforte concerto, one for violin, two smaller choruses with\r\norchestra, chamber works, piano pieces and songs. Another great choral\r\ncomposition, “Deutsche Fest-und Gedenksprüche,” a double concerto for\r\nviolin and violoncello, Gipsy songs and many other vocal and chamber\r\nworks complete the list of his more recent compositions. And more great\r\nthings may be expected from him. If there is anything inspiring in the\r\npresent aspect of musical art, it is the fact that Johannes Brahms is\r\nstill among us, physically and mentally as strong as if perpetual youth\r\nwere granted to him. Indeed, the graces and heroes have not only kept\r\nwatch at his cradle, but guided him throughout his long career.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHANNES BRAHMS.\r\n\r\n  In early youth.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThose who have met him will never forget the impression of his strong\r\npersonality. Nor will those who saw him conduct or heard him play ever\r\nenter into the superfluous discussion whether he was a great leader of\r\norchestra and chorus or a master of his instrument. For in both\r\ndirections he was not only equal to the most exacting demands, but\r\nalways appeared as if inspired, and inspiring everybody who sang or\r\nplayed under him or listened to the genius of his music. At the\r\npianoforte and the conductor’s desk he is a king, but socially he\r\nappears unaffected and easy, neither reticent nor predominating in\r\nconversation, jolly and kind among friends and children. He has never\r\nmarried. Many honors have been conferred upon him: the degrees of Doctor\r\nof Music by the University of Cambridge, England, in 1877, and of Doctor\r\nof Philosophy by the Breslau University in 1879; also several orders and\r\nthe membership of many societies and institutes. Throughout the musical\r\nworld his music, especially his instrumental works, is now received with\r\nenthusiasm, although still finding a strong opposition on the part of\r\nmany critics of either too conservative or too progressive tendencies.\r\nYet the time is not far distant when it will be generally granted a high\r\nposition in the history of our art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph manuscript of Canon by Brahms. “An Album Leaf.”\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph letter from Johannes Brahms to Karl Klauser.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThree prominent characteristics of Brahms’ works command our admiration.\r\nFrom the start he appeared as a strong individuality, and\r\nnotwithstanding a leaning towards Bach’s polyphonic art and harmonic\r\nwealth, Beethoven’s virile pathos and ideality of purpose, and\r\nSchubert’s melodic charm, he has spoken his own distinct language. In\r\nevery field of composition except the opera he has contributed\r\nmasterpieces which show that in each he has to-day no superior, and in\r\nbut few an equal. Throughout he impresses us by the fact that to him art\r\nhas always been something sacred, worthy of highest effort and noblest\r\npurpose. In this respect one may well compare him to Bach or Beethoven\r\nor Schiller, of whom Goethe so beautifully said, that “far behind him\r\nlay that which conquers us all,—vulgarity.” Whoever honestly strives for\r\nthe sympathy of his genius must be filled with a like earnest spirit,\r\nwilling to be guided by his subtle art into ideal regions full of higher\r\njoys than common musical amusements afford.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of his melodic, rhythmic and harmonic invention is truly\r\nastonishing; his combinations are so new and often intricate, the\r\nthematic material so rich or peculiar, its development so elaborate,\r\nthat it is a commonly expressed opinion that his music has to do more\r\nwith the intellect than with imagination and feeling. The truth is, that\r\nno modern composer has expressed deeper and more fervent feelings,\r\neither jubilant or sad, than Brahms. His great intellect only guides the\r\nwealth of emotion in order to find a well balanced, wholly original and\r\nartistic construction for the creatures of his rich imagination. And he\r\nis an eminently modern composer; with all his so-called conservative\r\ntendencies there is hardly a page in his works which could have been\r\nwritten at an earlier stage of musical art. Familiar with all the\r\nsubtleties of modern expression and innovations of harmony, rhythm, and\r\ninstrumentation, he has himself introduced many new and bold features.\r\n\r\nTo speak in detail of the one hundred and fifteen published works of\r\nBrahms would require a space far beyond the limits of this sketch. Thus\r\nonly a summary classification is possible. Looking first at the\r\ninstrumental compositions, one cannot praise Brahms too highly, that in\r\nopposition to prevailing tendencies towards a neglect of cyclic forms in\r\nfavor of free, rhapsodic or programmatic fantasias, he has cultivated\r\nthe former with supreme devotion, enriching and modifying them in many\r\nways, but so that they still appear as worthy representatives of their\r\ntypes.\r\n\r\nThe three pianoforte sonatas and the Scherzo Op. 4 reveal the cardinal\r\nfeatures of his later chamber and orchestral works: a most excellent\r\nthematic material, consisting often of but a few notes, awakening\r\nhighest expectations; a rich, ingenious development, always coherent and\r\nlogical; a Beethovenish virility; distinct contrasts and wonderful\r\nclimaxes in the lively opening and closing movements, usually beginning\r\ndirectly with the principal subject, the working-out section being\r\nespecially interesting and elaborate, the coda often of rare charm; the\r\nslow movements of delicate or intense, always noble feeling, in the form\r\nof variations or a long cantilena; the scherzos on a large plan, in\r\nthree-four or six-eight time, very spirited, with a quieter trio\r\npreceding the finale, except in No. 3, where a short intermezzo is\r\ninterpolated. Everywhere we note an ample and effective use of\r\nsyncopations, a peculiar style of accompaniments, bold modulations and\r\nrhythmic devices, occasionally even some programmatic suggestions. Few\r\nmasters have shown such originality and maturity in their first works.\r\n\r\nOf independent pianoforte variations there are sixteen on a touching\r\ntheme of Schumann, eleven on a beautiful original theme, thirteen on a\r\nHungarian theme (with a combination of three-four and four-four time),\r\ntwenty-five splendid variations on a short theme of Handel ending with a\r\ngreat fugue, some very difficult variations on a theme of Paganini,\r\nand—in a more romantic spirit—nine for four hands on that peculiar theme\r\nwhich Schumann had received “from the spirits of Schubert and\r\nMendelssohn.” Some of these important works have a suggestive and\r\nrefined sentimental character, others are virtuoso pieces of the highest\r\norder. As regards free conception of the variation form and variety of\r\nconstruction and mood, Brahms goes decidedly farther than Beethoven or\r\nSchumann. He seems inexhaustible in this form, which he used later most\r\ningeniously also in chamber and orchestra works. The four poetic ballads\r\nOp. 10, the capriccios and intermezzos Op. 76 and two Rhapsodies Op. 79\r\nare fine concert pieces of a freer but always coherent style, often very\r\ndifficult. More popular are the famous Hungarian dances (fascinating\r\nsettings of melodies, the authorship of which Brahms has never claimed),\r\nwhich he has orchestrated and arranged for four hands. His waltzes Op.\r\n39, also for four hands, are short character-pieces of a bright,\r\ngraceful or passionate spirit, in certain features recalling Schubert\r\nand Schumann, yet so original that they have been much imitated by\r\nyounger composers. Several piano works for technical study (after Weber,\r\nChopin and Bach), and fine arrangements of most of his chamber works and\r\norchestra serenades and of a gavotte of Gluck may at least be mentioned.\r\nThe difficulties of his pianoforte style, so rich in polyphonic\r\nfiguration, harmonic and rhythmic combinations, syncopations, and wide\r\nstretches, especially abound in the two seldom-played concertos. Yet,\r\nwithout the highest appreciation and sympathetic devotion, the greatest\r\nvirtuosity would never be able to make their inner life clear.\r\n\r\nLike a giant appears the early written D minor concerto. Quick\r\nmodulations, syncopations, chains of trills and a Beethovenish\r\nimportance of themes and development impress us mightily in the\r\npassionate first movement, divine sweetness in the long adagio, while\r\nthe finale, with its fantasia-like cadenza, rises from a simple mood to\r\nthe acme of enthusiasm. The B flat concerto Op. 83 has even four\r\nmovements, the long and romantic opening allegro being followed by an\r\nallegro appassionato of a superior scherzo character, the delightful\r\nandante by a highly effective allegro grazioso as finale. In spite of\r\nthe elaborate development and the variety of contrasting moods, the\r\nwhole work retains a bright and inspiring character. In both concertos\r\nthe important and richly scored symphonic accompaniment only raises the\r\nsolo part to greater prominence.\r\n\r\nA fugue and a choral prelude with fugue are Brahms’ only but significant\r\ncompositions for the organ.\r\n\r\nThe chamber works secure our master a place of honor beside the greatest\r\nrepresentatives of this high branch of composition; they comprise three\r\nsonatas for violin and two for violoncello and pianoforte, five\r\npianoforte trios (one with horn and one with clarinet), three string\r\nquartets, three pianoforte quartets, three string quintets (one with\r\nclarinet), one pianoforte quintet and two string sextets. In the older\r\nworks one feels often the struggle of a great soul with strong passions,\r\nlongings, hopes and anxieties, joys and pains, yet not lacking in\r\nsunshine and humor, while in the more recent compositions a quieter,\r\nmore contemplative spirit prevails. The classic arrangement of four\r\nmovements forms the rule, most of them being very elaborate and\r\nextensive, rich in themes of importance and beauty, the working out and\r\ncoda showing Brahms’ genius in the finest light, the treatment of the\r\ndifferent instruments being throughout masterly. The complicated\r\ndevelopment often prevents an immediate enjoyment, but increases our\r\ndesire for a closer acquaintance; for this counterpoint goes always hand\r\nin hand with true feeling. In the opening movements the first part is\r\nnot always repeated, and other novel features are introduced; the slow\r\nmovements in the form of variations or of a long developed cantilena\r\noften lift us into high and unwonted regions; the scherzos are so full\r\nof genius that one wonders why Brahms has not used this form in his\r\nsymphonies. The finales are of the highest order, seldom reached by\r\nother modern composers. In the works with horn and clarinets these much\r\nneglected instruments have received a wonderful treatment in music of\r\ngreat beauty. Unusual and complicated rhythms appear frequently, but\r\ntreated in a surprisingly easy way. The details are throughout deeply\r\ninteresting, yet often strange, even the most peaceful movements\r\nrequiring closest attention. If one of all these great works must be\r\ndistinguished as the greatest, we would name the pianoforte quintet in F\r\nminor, Op. 34. Yet the very latest work, the clarinet quintet, shows the\r\nsame freshness and originality of invention, wonderful thematic\r\nnet-work, variety of distinctly expressed moods, and the finale\r\ndisplaying an unsurpassed skill in variations.\r\n\r\nThe two orchestra serenades are real gems of spirited, delightful, well\r\nconstructed music, one being for complete orchestra, the other for\r\nviolas, ’celli, basses, reed instruments and horns. Besides the lively\r\nfirst and last movements and adagios they contain each a scherzo and one\r\nof them two minuets.\r\n\r\nThe theme for the nine orchestra variations Op. 56 is taken from one of\r\nHaydn’s divertimenti for wind instruments. They crown Brahms’ glorious\r\nachievements in the writing of variations; for, far from being “mere\r\nalgebraic experiments,” they are delightful and ingenious tone pictures\r\nof distinct character and mood, with a nearer or more remote relation to\r\nthe principal theme. The composer has thus initiated a new field of\r\nindependent orchestral music, already successfully followed by others.\r\nThe instrumentation is prominently interesting. It is generally admitted\r\nthat Brahms is very conservative compared with Wagner and Berlioz in the\r\nmatter of instrumentation. At least he never allows orchestral colors to\r\ndivert our attention from the higher, inner meaning of a work. Yet in\r\nthis score and in all his other works for or with orchestra, there are\r\nmany features either of wonderful brilliancy or peculiar colors, which\r\nas novelties are worth studying. The finale, built upon a much repeated\r\nbass figure, successively joined by the different groups of the\r\norchestra with other themes, reaches a beautiful climax in the pompous\r\nreturn of the original melody.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHANNES BRAHMS.\r\n\r\n  From an engraving by Weger, after a photograph from life.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe four symphonies in C minor, D, F and E minor are justly regarded as\r\nthe most important orchestral works of our generation. Much is still\r\nwritten against them, and not everybody is willing or able to share the\r\nenthusiasm which their good performance arouses among the majority of\r\ncultivated audiences. Yet nothing can shake their high position among\r\nall symphonic works written since the great master of the immortal Ninth\r\nhas left this earth. They have each a very individual character and,\r\nalthough in the main the old form is retained, new features are to be\r\nfound in almost every movement. The first symphony opens with an\r\nimpressive sostenuto introduction, the others begin at once with the\r\nprincipal subject of the allegro. Usually the first part of the latter\r\nis brought to a formal close and repeated; only in the fourth symphony,\r\nso rich in thematic material, no repetition occurs, but a very elaborate\r\nworking out prepares for the climax reached in the concentrated\r\nrecapitulation. Everywhere noble themes are finely contrasted,\r\nwonderfully developed, wholly or in fragments, in the working out, so as\r\nto hold the listener in breathless suspense. The allegros of the first\r\nand second symphonies have particularly fine codas. The slow movements\r\nare not very extensive and are easily enjoyed, their quieter and lofty\r\nmood being but little disturbed. However, the adagio in No. 2 is more\r\ncomplicated, has richer material, more frequent changes of key and\r\nrhythm, a more elaborate figure work and a peculiarly intimate spirit. A\r\nremarkable innovation is the consequent substitution for a minuet or\r\nscherzo of a sort of intermezzo, full of grace, sunshine and innocent\r\nplayfulness, hardly disturbed by more serious episodes. Most extended is\r\nthis in No. 4, a rondo with themes of an almost grotesque character,\r\nsurprising details in their development and a spirit of true\r\nBeethoven-like humor. Yet those of the first three symphonies are of no\r\nless importance, having two distinct parts, of which the second one\r\n(contrary to the older trio) has a livelier character. Especially that\r\nof No. 2 is one of the most delightful orchestral pieces of modern\r\nliterature. That Brahms is indeed a symphonist of the highest rank, is\r\nparticularly evident in his finales. That of No. 1 is conceived in the\r\ngrandest spirit, opened by a solemn introduction of overwhelming beauty\r\nand impressiveness, the allegro based on themes of rare inspiration,\r\ntheir wonderful development rising from climax to climax like a great\r\ntriumphal procession. Still the finale of No. 2 is not less inspiring;\r\neven more brilliant, with its glorious themes, the splendid\r\ninstrumentation and exciting coda. In No. 3 the closing movement has the\r\nunusual minor key, is less dithyrambic, yet not lacking in life, a\r\nchoral-like episode forming a fine contrast, and the whole ending\r\nhappily in a long, quiet coda in F major with a poetic reminiscence of\r\nthe principal subject of the opening movement. One may justly regard the\r\nfinale of No. 4 as a musical wonder, a new experiment gloriously carried\r\nout. It has the shape of a passacaglia, an old dance constructed upon a\r\nground bass. The theme consists of eight bars, each represented by a\r\nchord, and is treated in about thirty variations of the most ingenious\r\ncontrapuntal devices, greatly contrasted, yet so coherently that it\r\nsounds like an uninterrupted logical development, holding our interest\r\nkeenly alive and increasing our enjoyment till the splendid end is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nWe have thus seen how many strong features Brahms has introduced in the\r\nsymphonic form, without departing from its classic foundation; but it is\r\nstill more important that as a genius of a superior mind and noble soul\r\nhe had the right material in himself to fill this greatest form of\r\ninstrumental music with an adequate and original inner life, reflecting\r\nthe highest spirit of modern German civilization.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic feature of the Academic Festival Overture is the\r\nsuccessive introduction of several German student melodies, not in the\r\nform of a potpourri, as it has been unjustly regarded, but as themes\r\ndeveloped with consummate art, expressing the inspiration of a solemn\r\nfestival, of loyalty to the fatherland, of merrymaking and youthful\r\nexultation. Every page shows the hand of a superior master. Still\r\ngreater is the tragic overture, its spirit reflecting a heroic struggle,\r\ngloom, solemnity, but also hope and comfort; its form being particularly\r\ninteresting by an ingenious combination of the working out and\r\nrecapitulation into a sort of free, yet coherent, wonderfully\r\nconstructed and deeply impressive fantasia.\r\n\r\nHow much we should like to speak in detail of the two concertos for\r\nviolin and for violin and ’cello! It would be a misnomer to call them\r\nsymphonies with obligato solo parts, notwithstanding the very elaborate\r\norchestral score, but more incorrect to compare them with any virtuoso\r\nconcertos. Enormous technical difficulties are to be conquered in the\r\nservice of high musical purposes. The arrangement is after the classic\r\nmodel, in three movements. Of these the slow movements with their\r\nmelodic breadth are the more enjoyable, while the extensive outer\r\nmovements, with their rich development of peculiarly fine and original\r\nthemes, require repeated hearings to reveal all their innate beauty and\r\ngreatness. And these works, too, belong to the future and can afford to\r\nawait their time for a general appreciation.\r\n\r\nBrahms’ earlier chorus works are an Ave Maria for female chorus and\r\norchestra, a funeral chant with wind instruments, four female choruses\r\nwith harp and two horns, seven Marianan songs, a setting of the 23d\r\nPsalm for female chorus and organ, several motets and part songs for\r\nfour, five or six voices, sacred songs, and twelve romances for female\r\nchorus, partly with piano accompaniment. Now and then we are reminded of\r\nthe style of Palestrina or old German folk-songs, then again of Bach’s\r\npolyphonic art with fugues, simple and double canons, yet throughout of\r\na new, peculiar mode of expression, full of poetic sentiment. Among the\r\nworks of later years we mention two motets, which are praised as Brahms’\r\nhighest achievements in polyphonic writing, seven songs for mixed\r\nvoices, and many arrangements of old German folk-songs.\r\n\r\nThe German Requiem is of such great importance, that without a knowledge\r\nof it neither a full estimation of Brahms’ individual genius nor of the\r\nsignificance of the latest epoch of music in general can be obtained.\r\nTaking from the old Latin funeral mass only the name, Brahms selected\r\ncertain verses from the Bible, expressing not only the sadness and\r\nterror of death and judgment, but also hope and consolation,—even\r\nthankfulness and praise. His work, independent of any church service and\r\nto be sung in a living language, contains in each note music which came\r\nfrom the depth of a noble soul and was written by a master of the\r\nhighest and most complicated field of vocal composition. Entirely free\r\nfrom conventionalities or dry learning, each of the seven numbers gives\r\ncompletely what his genius was able to accomplish. It is indeed the\r\ngreat funeral chant of modern music, at least for Germans and\r\nProtestants. Choruses I., IV., V. and VII. have a quiet character,\r\nfinely expressing the milder feelings above mentioned, yet with all\r\ntheir seeming simplicity showing a consummate art in the details of\r\ntheir construction, No. V. being mainly given to a difficult soprano\r\nsolo. No. II. (“Behold all flesh is as the grass”) is a peculiar funeral\r\nmarch in three-four time, the chorus singing partly in unison to strange\r\nand impressive orchestral music; after a touching animato (“Be patient\r\nunto the coming of Christ”) the principal melody is repeated, followed\r\nby a long fugue (“The redeemed of the Lord shall return again”). No.\r\nIII. opens with a baritone solo, lamenting the frailty of life, soon\r\njoined by the chorus, rising to a climax expressive of hope. Then\r\nfollows that famous fugue, in an astonishingly rich polyphonic\r\ntreatment, moving over an uninterrupted, much criticised pedal point on\r\nD to emphasize the words, that “the righteous souls are in the hand of\r\nGod.” No. VI. is regarded as the culmination of the work. After the\r\nchorus’ lament that “Here on earth we have no continuing place,” comfort\r\nis brought by the baritone voice unfolding the mystery of the\r\nresurrection. The chorus repeat this and burst out in an ecstatic\r\nvivace, “The trumpet shall sound, the dead shall be raised!...” “...\r\nGrave, where is thy victory, death, where is thy sting?” In wonderful\r\nmodulations climax after climax is reached; finally in glorious C major\r\na double fugue is added, a hymn of praise to “the Lord of honor and\r\nmight,” whose proportion, art and impressiveness alone suffice to make\r\nBrahms a compeer of the greatest masters of polyphonic music.\r\nThroughout, chorus, orchestra and soloists have to overcome the greatest\r\ndifficulties, but seldom are their efforts directed to more ideal\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHANNES BRAHMS.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph from life by Fr. Luckhardt, Vienna.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor the “Song of Triumph” Brahms selected some mysterious verses from\r\nthe Apocalypse. Of the three large numbers for double chorus, orchestra\r\nand organ, some portions have been called direct imitations of Handel;\r\nyet even there one finds enough of Brahms’ individuality and throughout\r\nan intense heartiness and directness of feeling. In singing this music,\r\none is overwhelmed by its grandeur. The second number, more purely\r\nBrahms’, is of particular beauty, the chorus “Let us rejoice” being\r\njoined by a cantus firmus of the wood instruments on the choral “Now,\r\nthank ye all the Lord!” In No. III., opened by a baritone solo, an\r\nenthusiasm is reached in the Hallelujah surpassing any jubilant chorus\r\nmusic written since the Ninth Symphony.\r\n\r\nThe “Deutsche Fest-und Gedenksprüche” have a uniform patriotic purpose.\r\nThere are again three large and most difficult numbers for double\r\nchorus, without solo or accompaniment. No. I. refers to the battle of\r\nLeipsic in 1813 and the regained liberty from the Napoleonic bondage\r\n(“Our fathers hoped in thee, thou helpedst them,” etc.), and has an\r\nimposing character of resolution and vigor. No. II., referring to the\r\ncollapse of the French in 1870, illustrates in lively contrasting colors\r\n“a palace guarded by one strongly armed and remaining in peace” and “an\r\nempire that falls in discord and becomes waste.” No. III. praises the\r\nsplendor of the new united empire, but warns its people “to beware and\r\nguard thy soul well, that it shall never forget the story which thine\r\neyes have seen.” A deeply religious spirit also pervades this great and\r\nbut little known work.\r\n\r\nThe Rhapsody for alto solo, male chorus and orchestra treats a portion\r\nof Goethe’s “Journey through the Hartz in Winter.” Once in 1777 the poet\r\nleft a hunting party to pay an incognito visit to a young admirer of his\r\ngenius, who was in a Wertherish despondent condition of mind. The\r\nimpression received by this adventure gave rise to one of his deepest\r\nyet somewhat mysterious poems, which inspired Brahms to one of his\r\ngreatest works. The opening orchestral sounds touch our inmost heart;\r\nsighs and the anguish of a trembling soul is their spirit; then the solo\r\nvoice in tones of intense feeling asks for comfort for one “who from the\r\nfullness of love drank hate of man and in loneliness devours all that\r\nhath worth in him.” A peculiar combination of three-two and six-four\r\ntime illustrates finely this anguish and restlessness. Gradually the\r\nmusic becomes more quiet, till with a harp-like accompaniment, chorus\r\nand soloist sing a hymn of indescribable beauty and loftiness, imploring\r\n“the all-loving Father to enlighten the heart of the unfortunate, if but\r\none tone from his psalter can reach His ears.” The solo part requires a\r\ntruly inspired musician, whose voice is the instrument of his soul. The\r\nshort chorus is also a difficult task. Many times has the writer heard\r\nthis heavenly work, but never without its repetition being demanded and\r\ngiven. Yet how little known it is in this country!\r\n\r\nAn extensive work for male chorus with tenor solo and orchestra is the\r\ncantata “Rinaldo,” the text being again from Goethe. It deals with a\r\nromantic story from Tasso’s “Jerusalem Delivered,” has partly a solemn,\r\npartly a lively dramatic character and breathes the refreshing air of\r\nthe sea. The more or less extensive and elaborate choruses are very\r\ndifferent from the conventional style, the solo part is unusually\r\ndifficult and so exacting that an adequate performance is seldom\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nIn three works Brahms has illustrated the relentlessness of Fate,\r\nselecting poems of almost Greek grandeur and beauty. Hölderlin’s “Song\r\nof Destiny” contrasts the blessed abode of the divine spirits with the\r\nfate of the “restless, grief-laden mortals, who blindly wander from one\r\nsad hour to another.” Schiller’s “Nänie” mourns “that even the Beautiful\r\nfades and the Highest must die,” and “The Song of the Fates,” from\r\nGoethe’s “Iphigenia,” warns the human race “to fear the gods, doubly\r\nthose whom they have exalted, for they turn from entire races the light\r\nof their eyes.” The last work is for six, the others for four chorus\r\nvoices. Everywhere the orchestra is important, rich in weird,\r\ncharacteristic effects. Bold modulations and rhythmic combinations\r\nalways in keeping with the composer’s high conception of the poetry\r\naffect deeply ear and heart. Who but Brahms could have found music so\r\nworthy of such profound poetical subjects! In the “Song of Destiny” he\r\neven surpasses the poet by repeating at the end the wonderful orchestral\r\nintroduction indicating hope for our own final attainment of the abode\r\nof the blessed spirits. The “Nänie” is dedicated to the mother of the\r\nlamented painter Feuerbach, who had been a true art companion of Brahms.\r\nOnly a careful, sympathetic rendering will reveal the beauty of this\r\nwork. In the “Song of the Fates” there is a movement of a quiet,\r\nmelodious character, which many critics have declared to be entirely\r\ncontrary to the meaning of the text. To us it seems more like a well\r\njustified, touching expression of pious submission, wonderfully calming\r\nour excitement for the mysterious ending with its harmonies and\r\norchestral sounds never heard before.\r\n\r\nBrighter is the character of some works belonging to a field which\r\nSchumann had specially cultivated, yet where Brahms shows again such\r\noriginality that he has been much imitated. His delightful vocal\r\nquartets with piano accompaniment, graceful and bright or deep and\r\ngloomy, charm greatly by their artistic construction, beauty of thought,\r\nfeeling and sound and peculiarity of colors. Still more famous are the\r\ntwo collections of Love-Song Waltzes for voices and piano for four\r\nhands, resembling the sparkling pianoforte waltzes Op. 39, most varying\r\nin shape and mood, the words being mainly from Daumer’s “Polydora,”\r\nthose of the fine, quiet closing movement in nine-four time being\r\nselected from Goethe. The eleven Gipsy Songs Op. 102 are also meeting\r\nwith an enthusiastic reception, Hungarian spirit and rhythm giving them\r\na peculiar color, the moods being either humorous or passionate,\r\nmelancholy or exuberant, quartets alternating with solos, the\r\naccompaniment being as elaborate as it is effective.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty highly remarkable duets some have, in spite of many\r\nharmonic and rhythmic finesses, quite a plain character, while others\r\nare very elaborate, the voices either joining or alternating. As\r\nparticularly typical we mention “The Seas,” “The Nun and the Knight,”\r\n“The Sisters,” “The Messengers of Love,” “Edward,” and “Let us wander.”\r\n\r\nFinally we have reached the field in which Brahms has been especially\r\nfertile and original, his “Lieder.” To speak of them only in a general\r\nway is difficult indeed. Thirty-one of the published 115 works contain\r\nnearly 200 songs. Throughout his whole career Brahms has been writing\r\nsongs; there was in his soul a lyric element, kindled again and again by\r\nthe beauty of feeling, thought and diction of the great German poets,\r\nand he found a style of song-writing so independent, that in spite of\r\nsome more or less striking exceptions one can hardly trace his relation\r\nto Schubert, Schumann and Franz. He is their equal as regards wealth of\r\ninvention, noble conception of the text, finishing of details. Yet in\r\ntreatment of the voice, relation between vocal and instrumental part,\r\nand construction of the latter he opens a new path. In the selection of\r\npoems he shows eminent knowledge and taste. Many half-forgotten poems of\r\na superior order he has awakened to fresh life; others, which on account\r\nof their peculiar metre or meaning have been avoided, have found in him\r\nan unexpectedly effective interpreter. However, it seems to us as if the\r\npoems often suffer transformation. They have inspired the composer with\r\ncertain tone-pictures, which in turn impose upon them very distinctly\r\nthe spirit of his own strong individuality. This individuality is by no\r\nmeans always deep and heavy, for smiles and dancing are no strangers to\r\nit. Often the melodies are as plain as folk-songs, but always of great\r\nnobility. With a few notes the composer reaches our hearts and lifts us\r\nat once into a higher region. Other melodies again are as elaborate as a\r\ndramatic scene. The accompaniment, inexhaustible in forms, yet never\r\nconventional, simple or with great harmonic wealth and peculiar\r\nfiguration, rivals the singer in expressing the moods of the poem. Of\r\nthe so-called folk-songs (old German, Swiss, Bohemian, Scotch, Italian,\r\netc.) some are treated most artistically, others with a touching\r\nsimplicity. Very few poems composed by other masters are found among his\r\nlist, and the favorite poets Heine, Eichendorff, Chamisso are almost\r\navoided. A remarkable exception is the separately published\r\n“Moon-night,” very different from Schumann’s jewel song, yet not\r\ninferior. Goethe, Hölty, Platen, Tieck, Schenkendorf, Groth and Möricke\r\nare fully represented, often by poems of an antique spirit and form.\r\nKeller, Daumer, Heyse, Schack, Herder and many others inspired Brahms\r\ntoo, and it is noteworthy that he had no music for meaningless\r\ntrivialities. The majority of these songs are devoted to love in all\r\npossible phases and moods, often wonderfully reflected in scenes of\r\nnature. There is perhaps more of twilight and autumn than of sunshine\r\nand spring, but exultant and happy moods are well represented,—also\r\nflowers, birds, woods, oceans and storms and the stillness of the\r\nfields,—but all these more in a symbolic than realistic conception and\r\nwith a wonderful coloring of the prevailing mood. The sweet little\r\n“Cradle song,” “Erinnerung,” “Minnelied,” “Wie bist du, meine Königin?”\r\n“Meine Liebe ist grün,” “Von ewiger Liebe,” “Ruhe, Süssliebchen,”\r\n“Mainacht,” “Vergebliches Ständchen” are only a few familiar jewels\r\namong the rich collection; how many more deserve the same sympathy and\r\nstudy from singers with noble artistic ambitions! Special mention is due\r\nto the two fine songs for alto with viola obligato Op. 91 and to the\r\nfifteen romances from Tieck’s half-forgotten fairy tale “Die schöne\r\nMagelone,” which have a most elaborate form and an intensely emotional\r\ncharacter. Nowhere indeed can one get a better estimate of Brahms’ high\r\nsignificance as a song writer than here, where the poet appears like a\r\ndwarf in the light of the composer’s higher genius.\r\n\r\nGreatness indeed remains Brahms’ characteristic feature, wherever we\r\nlook at him or at his works; greatness in ideas, purposes and powers;\r\ngreatness in self-criticism and faithfulness to the dignity of his art;\r\ngreatness in the devotion to past masters and independence of\r\ncontemporary influences; greatness in the sincerity and simplicity of\r\nhis manners and relation to the outer world. Never appearing as a\r\nrevolutionary spirit, yet he has himself introduced many strong\r\ninnovations in various fields, and for a long time his works will not\r\nonly afford profound enjoyment to earnest lovers of our art, but be a\r\nsource of the most valuable studies for those to whom its further\r\ndevelopment will be entrusted. Long has he been ignored, patiently has\r\nhe waited, till the world has come to him to respect in him the noblest\r\nmusical genius of our time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Louis Keeserborn\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARL GOLDMARK\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a photograph from life, made by J. Löwy in Vienna._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                             CARL GOLDMARK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe date of the birth of Carl Goldmark, the eminent Austrian composer,\r\nis incorrectly given in the various biographical dictionaries to which\r\nthe writer has had access. For correct information on this point and for\r\nthe facts contained in the following sketch of the musician’s life,\r\nthanks are due to Leopold Goldmark, his brother. Carl Goldmark was born\r\nat Keszthely, Hungary, May 18, 1830. He came by his musical inclinations\r\nnaturally, for his father, Ruben Goldmark, was a precentor, much\r\nesteemed on account of his fine voice. The son showed a fondness for\r\nmusic at an early age and when very young began to take lessons on the\r\nviolin at the Musikverein of Oedenburg. His progress was such that at\r\nthe age of twelve his father permitted him to play in public. Soon\r\nafterward he began to play professionally in theatre orchestras. He\r\ncontinued to do so until the revolution of 1848, when he was obliged to\r\ngo into service in the army under the _landsturm_ law.\r\n\r\nWhen his term of service had come to an end he went to Vienna, where,\r\nwith the assistance of his eldest brother, Dr. Joseph Goldmark, he\r\nresumed his studies, becoming a pupil in the Böhm Conservatorium.\r\nUnfortunately for the young man, Dr. Goldmark had been an active\r\nparticipant in the insurrection and was suspected of implication in the\r\nkilling of Minister of War, La Tour. He was compelled to leave Austria\r\nand came to America, where he died in 1863. His flight threw Carl on his\r\nown resources, and the young musician succeeded in obtaining an\r\nengagement in the theatre orchestra at Raab, Hungary. Toward the end of\r\n1850, however, he returned to Vienna, where he secured employment in the\r\norchestra of the Theatre in the Josefstadt.\r\n\r\nYoung Goldmark at this time showed very plainly of what sort of material\r\nhe was made. His salary amounted to about $8 a month, but his ambition\r\nwas worth hundreds. He was consumed by a desire to learn to play the\r\npiano, but he could not afford to pay a teacher. He managed, however, to\r\nhire an instrument, and began to study by himself with occasional hints\r\nfrom friends. Returning late from the theatre to his humble lodgings, he\r\nwould spend half the night in practising by the light of a tallow\r\ncandle. It may as well be said here that he became sufficiently\r\nproficient as a pianist to give lessons in later years, and he also\r\ntaught himself the art of singing with such success that he became the\r\ninstructor of Mme. Bettelheim, a contralto who attained prominence on\r\nthe Austrian stage. With the exception of his violin lessons and a short\r\ncourse in composition at the Vienna Conservatory under Sechter,\r\nself-instruction was all the teaching enjoyed by young Goldmark. He\r\nstudied assiduously the scores of Mozart, Weber and Beethoven, and\r\nattended the Helmesberger chamber music concerts in Vienna, thus gaining\r\na valuable acquaintance with the instrumental works of the best masters.\r\nGoldmark was, however, not only a student of music. He made himself\r\nconversant with the German, French, Italian and English Languages. He\r\nalso became a devoted student of philosophy, and learned to look up to\r\nSchopenhauer with a truly Wagnerian admiration. In 1850 he became a\r\ncontributor to the _Grenzboten_ and to some of the Leipsic musical\r\npapers. His writings have always shown evidence of his wide culture.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1855 that he began to compose, and in 1857 he gave a concert\r\nof his own works at the Vienna Musikverein-Halle. The compositions\r\npresented were an overture, a piano quartet, a ballad for tenor, chorus\r\nand orchestra, and two songs. He was at that period of his career a\r\ndevoted follower of Mendelssohn, and the works played at his concert\r\nwere in that master’s style. Goldmark’s fondness for his early offspring\r\nwas short-lived and the works were not published. He outlived his\r\nMendelssohnian devotion and subsequently became a fervent admirer of\r\nSchumann, whose influence is clearly discernible in some of his later\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThe composer’s first decided success was the overture to “Sakuntala,”\r\nopus 13, written in 1864, and now known favorably all over Europe and in\r\nthis country. In 1865, while walking in one of the principal streets of\r\nVienna, he saw a picture of the Queen of Sheba visiting Solomon. The\r\npicture made a vivid impression on his imagination, and at length he\r\nwent to H. S. Mosenthal, the well known dramatist, author of “Leah, the\r\nForsaken,” and begged him to undertake the task of constructing a\r\nlibretto out of the story which had grown up in the composer’s mind. In\r\nthree years the opera was finished in its first shape, but Goldmark was\r\ndissatisfied with it. Mosenthal made the desired changes in the book,\r\nand about one-half of the score was rewritten, the work being finished\r\nearly in 1872. Goldmark then submitted it to Joseph Herbeck, conductor\r\nof the court opera at Vienna. It is believed that Herbeck was jealous of\r\nGoldmark, because the latter had defeated him in a competition for a\r\nGovernment prize of 800 gulden. At any rate Herbeck kept the score of\r\n“The Queen of Sheba” locked up for two years. Finally, at a musicale\r\ngiven by the Princess Hohenlohe, whose husband was master of ceremonies\r\nto the Emperor, Ignatz Brüll, then a rising young pianist, played some\r\nselections from Goldmark’s opera. The Princess and others, pleased by\r\nthe music, asked Brüll some questions about the work, and the story of\r\nHerbeck’s delay over the score came out. The influence of the Princess\r\nand the Countess Andrassy led to an imperial command for the production\r\nof the opera, and it was accordingly performed on March 10, 1875. The\r\nsuccess of the opera was great and the composer was called out nearly\r\nforty times. “The Queen of Sheba” has been given in various European\r\ncities, and was first performed in America at the Metropolitan Opera\r\nHouse, New York, on Wednesday, Dec. 2, 1885, with the following cast:\r\nSulamith, Frau Lilli Lehman; the Queen, Frau Krämer-Wiedl; Astaroth,\r\nFräulein Marianne Brandt; Solomon, Herr Robinson; Assad, Herr Stritt;\r\nBaal Hanan, Herr Alexi; High Priest, Herr Fischer. The conductor was\r\nAnton Seidl. It was the most successful opera in the repertory of the\r\nhouse that season, being presented fifteen times, to aggregate receipts\r\nof $60,000. It was given four times the following season, and again five\r\ntimes in the season of 1889–90, always to audiences of good size.\r\n\r\nHis second opera, “Merlin,” was produced in Vienna Nov. 19, 1886, and at\r\nthe Metropolitan Opera House Jan. 3, 1887, with the following cast:\r\nViviane, Lilli Lehmann; Morgana, Brandt; Artus, Robinson; Modred,\r\nKemlitz; Gawein, Heinrich; Lancelot, Basch; Merlin, Alvary; Dämon,\r\nFischer. The conductor was Walter Damrosch. It was performed five times\r\nin the course of the season, but did not achieve the success of its\r\npredecessor. While waiting for the production of “The Queen of Sheba,”\r\nGoldmark wrote his B flat quartet and his suite for piano and violin.\r\n\r\nGoldmark has devoted his life to composition. He takes no pupils and has\r\nrefused not only all orders and distinctions, but all offers of posts as\r\nconductor. The only office he has ever held—and that but briefly—is the\r\npresidency of the Vienna Tonkünstlerverein. His home is in Vienna, but\r\nabout May 1st of every year he goes to Gmunden, on the Traunsee in upper\r\nAustria. There he remains till October, working incessantly except\r\nduring four weeks in midsummer. He then takes a vacation, going to the\r\nFusch valley, near Salzburg, where he spends six to eight hours a day in\r\nmountain climbing. All his composing is done at Gmunden. He is a widower\r\nand has a daughter twenty years of age.\r\n\r\nGoldmark’s principal works are the two operas already mentioned, the\r\n“Sakuntala,” “Penthesilea,” “Spring” and “Prometheus” overtures, the\r\nsymphony in E flat and the “Ländliche Hochzeit” symphony, and the violin\r\nconcerto in A minor, opus 28. These are the works by which he is best\r\nknown in this country, his chamber music being played infrequently. The\r\ncomposer’s musical development is readily divided into two periods. He\r\nmade the division himself when, in 1875, he decided that he would\r\nabandon his earlier style of writing, in which he had made extensive use\r\nof Oriental melody and color. He imbibed a fondness for this style when\r\nin his childhood he listened to the voice of his father in the\r\nsynagogue. He himself seems to have felt, however, that in giving his\r\nmusic a local or racial coloring he was detracting from its\r\nuniversality, and after the production of the “Queen of Sheba,” he said\r\nto his friends that he would write no more eastern music. It was\r\ndoubtless this determination which led him to select the story of Merlin\r\nas the subject for his next opera. The most thoughtful critics of\r\nGoldmark’s music are of the opinion that he was not wise in his\r\ndetermination. As an Oriental colorist in music, he certainly has no\r\nsuperior, and probably no equal, while his “Merlin” is without the most\r\ninteresting manifestations of his individuality. Goldmark without his\r\ncolor is Swinburne without his versification. The composer’s best works,\r\nexcept the overture to “Prometheus,” are surely those written before the\r\nresolution of 1875.\r\n\r\nThe story of “The Queen of Sheba” is not taken from the Bible, but is\r\npurely imaginary. It deals with the fascination of Assad, a courtier, by\r\nthe beautiful Queen, who has indulged in a passage of love with him on\r\nher journey to Solomon’s court. When Assad recognizes her in Solomon’s\r\npalace, she denies having met him before, but both Solomon and Sulamith,\r\nAssad’s promised bride, see that something is wrong. The Queen again\r\nshows herself to Assad by night, and the next day in the palace. Assad\r\nproclaims the truth. Solomon decrees that the youth must work out his\r\nsalvation by defeating the powers of evil, and banishes him to the\r\ndesert. Sulamith seeks him and he dies in her arms, while the Queen and\r\nher caravan are seen in the distance returning homeward. Dr. Mosenthal’s\r\nlibretto is not a fine poetic achievement, but it is theatrically very\r\neffective, blending spectacular and dramatic scenes in a telling manner.\r\nThe composer has made excellent use of his opportunities. Assad’s\r\nrecital of his first adventure with the Queen, is set to admirably\r\ndescriptive music, and it is followed by a most captivating ballet and\r\nan inspiring chorus of greeting to the Queen. The ensuing scene is\r\nrichly dramatic. The duet between the Queen and Assad in the moonlit\r\ngarden is intensely passionate and glows with the warm color of eastern\r\nmelody. The instrumental richness of the score seems to be quite as\r\nnatural an outcome of the composer’s fancy as his easy adoption of\r\nOriental rhythms and cadences, which he handled as one to the manner\r\nborn. The most important objection which has been made to this music is\r\nthat it is “so unvaryingly stimulated that it wearies and makes the\r\nlistener long for a fresher and healthier musical atmosphere.” The\r\nproduction of “The Queen of Sheba” in New York was one of the most\r\nbrilliant spectacles ever seen in America, and the performances were\r\nrich in musical merit.\r\n\r\nThe comparative failure of “Merlin” was due largely to the effort of the\r\nlibrettist, Herr Siegfried Lipiner, to mingle the supernatural with the\r\nstory of Merlin and Vivien and to drag in Goethe’s principle of saving\r\nwomanhood—a favorite theme with Wagner. Indeed, there are many things in\r\nthe libretto which indicate that it was suggested by Wagnerian works,\r\nchiefly “Parsifal.” The librettist’s greatest success was in his\r\ncharacterization of Vivien, which is excellent. The composer also fell\r\ninto the Wagnerian pit and strove vainly to handle the _Leitmotif_. His\r\nmusic, moreover, suffered, as has already been intimated, from his\r\ndetermined effort to rid himself of the Oriental color which was his\r\nnatural garb. Nevertheless it must be said in justice to Goldmark, that\r\nno operatic writer of our time has shown a greater seriousness of\r\npurpose than that manifested in “Merlin.” The musical dialogue of the\r\nopera is nobly elevated in style, but lacks variety. The orchestration\r\nis rich and glowing in color, yet is without complexity of construction,\r\nand there is a delightful absence of the set forms of the old-fashioned\r\nopera. But “Merlin” lacks the inspiration and the spontaneity of style\r\nwhich are displayed by the composer when laboring in his congenial\r\nOriental field.\r\n\r\nThe “Ländliche Hochzeit” symphony is a symphony in name rather than in\r\nfact. It is a series of descriptive movements, written with a little of\r\nthe composer’s characteristic tinge of Orientalism and with all of his\r\nmastery of instrumental coloring. It is fluent, melodious and strongly\r\nrhythmical. In short, it is music that pleases a miscellaneous audience\r\nwithout offending the discriminating music-lover. The symphony in E\r\nflat, like the violin concerto, the present writer regards as one of the\r\ncomposer’s least happy achievements. It is but just to say, however,\r\nthat some good judges do not hold this opinion of the work. The first\r\nmovement is built on a flowing and rhythmic theme announced by the\r\nviolins, and from this the second subject is very happily deduced; but\r\nneither is fruitful in itself. The scherzo is by far the best movement,\r\nand is, indeed, a bit of writing of which any recent symphonist might be\r\nproud. It is light and airy in theme and the instrumentation is\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nThe violin concerto in A minor is lacking in spontaneity of thought.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to Goldmark’s overtures, however, we find the composer at\r\nhis best. All his overtures are admirable, one is exceptionally fine,\r\nand another is great. The “Sakuntala” overture is deemed Goldmark’s best\r\nby many critics, but the present writer prefers the “Prometheus.” The\r\nstory of the love of King Dushyanta for Sakuntala, daughter of the Saint\r\nViswamitra and the water nymph Menaka, is one of the most beautiful in\r\nthe Hindoo mythology. The maiden is reared in the forest by Kanwa, and\r\nthere Dushyanta, while hunting, meets and loves her. The principal\r\nthemes in Goldmark’s overture are the melodies representing Sakuntala’s\r\nloneliness in the forest, the royal hunt, and the love of the king and\r\nthe maiden. The composition is opulent in its Oriental richness of color\r\nand is full of the passionate intensity and vigorous aggressiveness of\r\nthe strongest scenes in the “Queen of Sheba.”\r\n\r\nThe “Prometheus” overture, a product of Goldmark’s maturity, is a superb\r\nwork, one of the most admirable produced in recent years, and one that\r\nought to live. The composer has chosen some of the salient features of\r\nÆschylus’s sublime tragedy, and has expressed them eloquently. The\r\nopening measures speak of the loneliness of the chained Prometheus,\r\nsurrounded by the empty infinity of space. A beautiful theme in the wood\r\nis said to signify the prostrate god’s hope, but such an interpretation\r\nis not justified by the tragedy. The writer prefers to regard it as an\r\nexpression of the repose of the sea, whence floats up a few measures\r\nlater the sympathetic chorus of sea-nymphs, represented by two themes,\r\none a lovely undulating melody in the wood, the other, speaking more\r\neloquently of their yearning over Prometheus, a flowing melody for the\r\nstrings. The bold, restless spirit of the god is finely expressed by the\r\nallegro, with which the sea-nymph music is worked out in effective\r\ncontrast. An increase in tempo and a change in the melody near the end\r\nof the work lead to a forcible proclamation of Jove’s sentence by the\r\ntrombones, and the whole closes with the music of space and the sea. In\r\nform, in instrumentation and in elaboration, as well as in emotional\r\ncontent, the overture is noble.\r\n\r\nThe “Penthesilea” overture is founded on the Homeric episode of the\r\nemotion of Achilles over the beautiful corpse of the Amazon queen, slain\r\nby him in battle. The composition is very clear in purpose and is well\r\nwritten. The “Spring” overture is the least striking of the works under\r\nconsideration, yet it displays much of the composer’s mastery of\r\norchestral technique.\r\n\r\nGoldmark’s music, on the whole, is distinguished by a deep and manly\r\nwarmth, a restless aggressiveness and a hyperbolic instrumental\r\nlanguage. In this latter respect it resembles Eastern poetry in the\r\nextravagance of its forms of expression, at times approaching bombast.\r\nAt his best, however, as in the “Prometheus” overture, the composer is\r\ncapable of strong, serious, lofty feeling, noble dignity of utterance\r\nand reposeful symmetry of form. It is because this overture exhibits\r\nthese powers of Goldmark in a higher form than his other compositions\r\nthat the present writer looks upon it as his greatest work. His operas\r\nare eclectic in style and the result is something between Meyerbeer and\r\nWagner; but in his overtures the individuality of Goldmark is most\r\nclearly revealed. Admirable as much of his chamber music is, it suffers\r\nby comparison with his larger works because of the lack of those\r\ninstrumental colors which the composer uses with such dazzling effect.\r\nIt is impossible to predict the future of Goldmark’s music; but it\r\ncertainly belongs to the present, and some of it seems likely to live.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: N. J. Henderson.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAX BRUCH\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a photograph from life, made by Falk in New York._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                               MAX BRUCH\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the nineteenth century probably no composer has\r\ndone more for the development of the chorus, and especially of the\r\n_Maennerchor_, than Max Bruch, and although he has achieved much in\r\norchestral scoring, and has written fine concertos, symphonies, and even\r\nlarge operas, it is upon his great choruses that his fame as a composer,\r\nand his right to admission to the ranks of the masters, chiefly rests.\r\nHe was born in Cologne, Jan. 6, 1838, and his musical powers developed\r\nvery early, for by the time that he had reached his fourteenth year, he\r\nhad already written upwards of seventy compositions, although wisely\r\nforbearing to print them and thereby take rank as a “musical prodigy.”\r\nOne of these juvenile works was a symphony, and received a public\r\nperformance in Cologne in 1852. As with the first compositions of\r\nMendelssohn, however, these early works are to be regarded merely as\r\nrecords of juvenile possibilities and are not reckoned with the great\r\nand serious contributions to music which Bruch was able to make in riper\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHis parents gladly aided his efforts to develop his musical abilities by\r\nthorough training, and to his mother he owes much of the success of his\r\njuvenile studies. This lady, once famous as Fräulein Almenräder, was\r\nherself a distinguished singer, and came of a well-known musical family\r\nof the lower Rhine country. She personally attended to the elementary\r\nsteps of Bruch’s musical curriculum, but he was early sent to Professor\r\nHeinrich Karl Breidenstein of Bonn, who took charge of his theoretical\r\nstudies. These succeeded so well that the compositions of the\r\nnine-year-old boy attracted the notice of Ferdinand Hiller, who soon\r\nafter took him in charge and developed his abilities so rapidly and\r\nthoroughly that at fourteen years the boy was able to enter for the\r\nMozart scholarship awarded in Frankfort. The string quartette which he\r\nwrote for this occasion won the prize. This obtained for him a yearly\r\n_stipendium_ of four hundred gulden, which he enjoyed for four years,\r\nand which enabled him to continue his studies with Hiller, and also to\r\nobtain instruction from Professors Carl Reinecke and Ferdinand Breuning,\r\nstudying piano under the latter with especial zeal and success. Long\r\nvisits to Munich, Leipsic and other musical centers followed, and\r\ncontinued to broaden the musical horizon of the young genius. At Munich\r\nhe made the personal acquaintance of the poet Emanuel Geibel, who had\r\nmuch influence upon his later work in the large musical forms. The\r\nwinter of 1857–8, passed in Leipsic, seems to have also wielded a great\r\ninfluence in awakening Bruch’s enthusiasm for the higher walks of music.\r\nAfter this year, we find him once more in his native city of Cologne,\r\nenjoying a reputation which even at that time was much more than local.\r\nHe had, until this time, published only compositions in the small forms,\r\npiano pieces, songs, and duets, but with his first two choruses we find\r\nthe first ocular evidences of talent, and from the very beginning the\r\nmassing of voices seems to have possessed a peculiar charm for, and to\r\nhave been well understood by him.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, after the death of his father, Bruch began a two-years’ stay in\r\nMannheim, and his friendship with Vincenz Lachner, which began at this\r\ntime, undoubtedly had an influence on his compositions. In 1865, he went\r\nto Coblentz to assume the directorship of the musical institute there,\r\nand this was the beginning of the period of his greatest creative\r\nactivity. In 1867, he became director of the court orchestra in\r\nSondershausen, a position which had been held by such masters as Spohr\r\nand Weber, and for three years we find him diligently perfecting himself\r\nin the art of conducting, in which he has become very celebrated, being\r\none of the few composers who are successful on the conductor’s stand. In\r\n1870, Bruch went to Berlin, where he lived some years, not accepting any\r\nposition, but busying himself entirely with composition. After this he\r\nsettled in Bonn for a short time. In 1878 he was called to Berlin to\r\nsucceed Julius Stockhausen as director of the famous Stern Gesangverein.\r\nHis next engagement took him across the seas, and he went to Liverpool\r\nto succeed Sir Julius Benedict as director of the Philharmonic society\r\nin 1880. This engagement ended in the Spring of 1883 (some biographies\r\ncommit an error here, in setting the date a year earlier), and he\r\nimmediately came to America where he conducted a number of his\r\ncompositions. In the summer of 1883 he returned to Germany, and from\r\nSeptember of that year he was the director of the Breslau Orchestral\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MAX BRUCH\r\n\r\n  From a wood engraving at the British Museum.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis continued until the spring of 1890, when he closed his labors as\r\nconductor and settled in Friedenau, near Berlin, where he is at present;\r\nbut he is so fond of travel, so full of energy and activity, that he is\r\nnot likely to remain in retirement very long. In 1890 he received the\r\nhonorary title of Royal Professor.\r\n\r\nIn personal appearance Bruch is by no means as majestic as one would\r\nsuppose from his works. He is small of stature, and his dark eyes peer\r\nthrough his spectacles with the sharp glance of a teacher rather than of\r\na creator of heroic cantatas. He is quick and nervous in motion and,\r\nwhen directing an orchestra or chorus, his gestures are spontaneous and\r\nexpressive.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to notice that the juvenile compositions of Bruch had\r\ntheir origin in filial affection and that one of the earliest of his\r\nworks is a prayer for his parents, which the nine-year-old boy arranged\r\nas a song. But the actual career of the composer commenced with the\r\nchoruses, which he began to write in his twenty-first year.\r\n\r\nThe first of these choruses (Op. 8) bore the title of “Birken und Erlen”\r\n(“Birches and Alders”), and the second (Op. 3) “Jubilate, Amen.” In both\r\nof the works a soprano voice is used _obligato_ against four-part\r\nchorus, and there are not only rich harmonies, but a wonderful blending\r\nof the solo with the chorus part. Just before these works, Bruch had\r\nwritten a little one-act opera, his Opus I, entitled “Scherz, List, und\r\nRache,” on Goethe’s libretto, but it made no very marked impression;\r\nsoon after, however, he turned his attention to larger opera, and the\r\nresult was that Emanuel Geibel’s libretto, “Loreley,” which had been\r\nwritten years before, for Mendelssohn (that master was at work upon this\r\nsubject when he met his early death), was now brought to the operatic\r\nstage by him. At first the poet opposed the thought of presenting the\r\nwork save on the concert platform, but finally consented to allow it a\r\ntrial at the theatre of Mannheim. The opera deals with one of the most\r\npoetical conceptions of the Rhine-witch, which makes her appear at first\r\nas a pure and beautiful maiden, named Leonore, but heartbroken and\r\nfrenzied by betrayal and desertion, she seals a bond with the spirits of\r\nthe stream, and with them wages war on mankind. Mendelssohn had already\r\ncomposed the scene of the invocation of the river-demons, and the\r\nfestival of the vintagers, and Bruch’s music to these scenes bears the\r\ntest of comparison, which is saying much when it is considered that the\r\nearlier setting was the last work of the more celebrated composer, and\r\nthis was composed at the beginning of Bruch’s career. Bruch’s “Vintage\r\nChorus” is frequently given by male choruses as a concert selection. The\r\nperformance at Mannheim was successful and the opera was afterwards\r\npresented at many other theatres, and notably at Hamburg and Leipsic, in\r\nboth of which cities it won great applause from public and press. Yet\r\nthe work has now totally disappeared from the stage, since it is not\r\nreally a dramatic subject, the change of the heroine from an innocent\r\nand confiding maiden to a fierce and revengeful spirit, a first cousin\r\nto the Greek Sirens, is rather a metaphysical than a theatrical one, and\r\nthe plot occasioned some repetition of style which weakened the music.\r\nAbout ten years later Bruch once more essayed opera, and failed. This\r\ntime Shakespeare was the librettist, and under the title of “Hermione”\r\nthe new work, which was the “Winter’s Tale,” was performed in Berlin and\r\nDresden, but in neither city did it win more than a _succès d’estime_.\r\nIt has disappeared from the repertoire altogether, yet the second act is\r\na gem that will bear rescuing from oblivion. It represents Hermione in\r\nprison, and at her trial, and so well is the pathos and intensity of the\r\nmusic fitted to the situation, that it is not exaggeration to speak of\r\nthis portion of the opera as being among the finest things that Bruch\r\nhas ever written, and it may be ranked with the very best of modern\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile manuscript of beginning of Adagio in Max Bruch’s first\r\n    Violin Concerto.\r\n\r\n  Original in possession of Prof. Dr. Emil Naumann, in Dresden.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe now approach the epoch when Bruch produced a work which at once drew\r\nthe attention, not of Germany alone, but of the entire musical world\r\ntowards his labors; we have intimated that the composer’s fame rests\r\nchiefly on what he has done for chorus singing, and it is in the\r\ntreatment of male chorus that Bruch is unsurpassed; it was with such a\r\nwork,—“Frithjof” (Op. 23),—that he won his first great triumph. The\r\ntext, by Esaias Tegner, taken from the grand old Sagas, afforded a\r\nsombre dignity that suited well to a massive use of _maennerchor_, and\r\nonce more Bruch added a female voice, not in combination, but rather in\r\ncontrast to the chorus work, to illustrate the character of the unhappy\r\nIngeborg. The baritone solos, the utterances of the viking Frithjof, are\r\nfull of expression, and the chorus of the returning heroes at the\r\nbeginning of the cantata is melodious in the highest degree. Seldom, in\r\na modern work, has so much of melody been employed, without weakening\r\nthe dramatic treatment, but the final chorus of the departing warriors\r\nmay be cited as a perfect example of this happy combination in Bruch’s\r\nchoruses. “Frithjof” may also stand as a model of condensation in\r\ndramatic music; every note has its purport, and there is not a measure\r\nin the entire work that is supererogatory. The contrasts are also\r\nmanaged with a master-hand, so that the emotions of peace and war are\r\ngiven in kaleidoscopic, yet logical, succession.\r\n\r\nImmediately following this there came an almost equally important\r\ncontribution to the repertoire of mixed chorus; this was “Schön Ellen,”\r\na cantata for chorus combined with soprano and baritone solos. The\r\nsubject taken was again a warlike one, being founded on the fabulous\r\ntale invented by a newspaper correspondent, that during the siege of\r\nLucknow, a Scotch girl named Jessie Brown heard the bagpipes of the\r\nregiments sent to the relief of the place, long before they were audible\r\nto the rest of the garrison, and was able thereby to prevent a surrender\r\nto the merciless Sepoys surrounding it. Emanuel Geibel, the poet, turned\r\nthe mythical Jessie Brown into an equally mythical “Fair Ellen,” and\r\ngave the libretto to the composer, who began its composition within\r\nsound of the cannon at the battle of Sadowa the culmination of the\r\nAustro-Prussian war. The subject was full of dramatic possibilities, and\r\nBruch used these in the condensed manner characteristic of the preceding\r\nwork. Naturally he was impelled towards Scotch music by the color of the\r\npoem, and the entire cantata is founded on “The Campbells are comin’,”\r\nwhich is omnipresent in it, and forms a grand climax to the whole as a\r\nhymn of thanksgiving. Yet many may have blamed Bruch for departing from\r\nthe Scotch character of the theme in this lofty finale; few musicians\r\nwill join in this censure, for the composer has but allowed himself the\r\nfreedom of the Fantasie in this development of a folk-theme. It is not\r\nthe only time that a German composer has used this melody in a developed\r\nmusical work, for Robert Volkmann employed it in his overture “Richard\r\nIII.”; a Scotch theme written in 1568, in an English battle fought in\r\n1485!\r\n\r\nIt may be fitting in this place to speak of the influence which the\r\nScotch folk-music exerted upon Bruch. He once assured the writer of this\r\narticle that he was familiar with over four hundred of the Scotch\r\nfolk-songs. After the completion of “Fair Ellen” his taste in this\r\ndirection was again shown in the “Scotch Fantasie” (Op. 46) for violin\r\nand orchestra, which is one of Sarasate’s favorite solos, and he also\r\narranged twelve Scotch folk-songs with considerable success. Yet it may\r\nfairly be doubted whether Bruch has ever been able to reproduce the lilt\r\nso characteristic of Gaelic music; in this failure, however, he is not\r\nalone, for Beethoven, Schumann, and others among the German masters have\r\nattempted this vein fruitlessly; Mendelssohn alone, among the ranks of\r\nthese, accomplished the transplanting of the delicate flower of Scotch\r\nfolk-music into German classical works.\r\n\r\nThe immense success that followed the production of “Frithjof,” and the\r\nalmost equal favor extended to “Fair Ellen,” was reflected on Bruch’s\r\nearlier works, and the “Roman Song of Triumph” (Op. 19, No. 1) was\r\nbrought into popularity in its wake, and once more we hear the stern\r\nnotes of war and victory sounding in the massive chords of the male\r\nchorus. Soon after the triumph of “Frithjof” we find the composer\r\nreturning to the subject, and Op. 27 deals with “Frithjof at the grave\r\nof his father,” but it was like Milton’s “Paradise Regained” after\r\n“Paradise Lost,” a weak work after a masterpiece, and this concert-scene\r\nfor baritone solo, female chorus, and orchestra, fell rather flat.\r\n\r\nThe true successor of “Frithjof” was to come later in the shape of\r\nanother warrior, this time a Grecian; in the “Odysseus,” Op. 41, with\r\nUlysses as his hero, we find the composer rising to the height of the\r\npreceding subject, but in another and less stern manner. This had been\r\npreceded by yet another tone-picture of warriors, in the\r\n“Normannen-zug,” a stately union of baritone solo, with unison male\r\nchorus and orchestra (all the above-mentioned cantatas have orchestral\r\naccompaniment) but in “Odysseus” all the resources of modern scoring are\r\nemployed and both mixed and male choruses are present in most effective\r\nnumbers. “Odysseus” exhibits Bruch’s instrumentation in the best light,\r\nand proves him a master of the modern orchestral resources. These\r\ninstrumental forces are always employed with the most perfect taste, and\r\nthe accompaniment of the great unison male chorus of the Rhapsodes by\r\ntremendous pizzicato chords, as of a giant harp, is a touch of\r\nindescribable dignity; some of the finest mixed choruses which the\r\ncomposer has written are to be found in this work.\r\n\r\nOther large compositions for solo voices, chorus, and orchestra,\r\nfollowed. “Arminius” (this time a German warrior was the hero) may not\r\nbe ranked with the inspired works mentioned above, but is nevertheless a\r\nfavorite with the composer, and all creators in art have the privilege\r\nof loving their weakest children best; “The Song of the Bell,” on\r\nSchiller’s great poem, although a fine work, full of power and majesty,\r\ndoes not bring out all the dramatic possibilities of the subject, but is\r\nnever-less far more effective than the Romberg setting; “Achilleus”\r\n(again a martial theme) is one of the most recent works of the master,\r\nand in his Op. 52 he turns again to Scotia and in the “Fiery Cross” we\r\nfind Sir Walter Scott’s “Lady of the Lake” appearing in some of its\r\nwarlike phases.\r\n\r\nSo much for the chief vocal works of this master; it will be seen that\r\nhe loves historic pictures, and the poets Geibel, Lingg, and Scheffel\r\nhave helped him by libretto and advice in this direction; and he sings\r\nso constantly of war and warriors, that he may be called the Tyrtæus of\r\nmodern music. But it must not be supposed that his entire work has been\r\nin this field only; he has won much success in some of the large\r\ninstrumental forms as well. His three symphonies in E flat, F minor, and\r\nE major, are but seldom performed, but it is difficult to discover the\r\ncause of this neglect; possibly the earnest, sombre, even gloomy tints\r\nof the second are not to the taste of those who seek only pleasure in\r\nmusic. But the third symphony in E is genial and attractive and would\r\nplease almost any cultured audience although it is not in the strictest\r\nform. The first two symphonies are built in classical style, and Bruch\r\nseems to have taken Beethoven for his model in this field. It must be\r\nconfessed, however, that none of the three works has yet received due\r\nappreciation. Vastly different is it with the two violin concertos, the\r\nfirst of which is dedicated to Joachim, the second to Sarasate; these\r\nare very frequently heard in our concert rooms and the first, (in G\r\nminor, Op. 26) may be mentioned as one of the chief works in this form,\r\nand equal, and by some held superior, to Mendelssohn’s well-known violin\r\nconcerto.\r\n\r\nThe third violin concerto is scarcely known yet in America. It was\r\nplayed at the music festival of Düsseldorf, by Joseph Joachim, with\r\ngreat success. It has a dreamy, prayerful, second movement, and a most\r\nmartial and brilliant finale, but its first movement is prolix when\r\ncompared with the power of the themes of the G minor concerto.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to append a list of the most important of Bruch’s\r\npublished compositions; they are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Op. 1. “Scherz, List und Rache.” (Goethe.) A comic opera in one act.\r\n\r\n  Op. 3. “Jubilate, Amen.” For Soprano, Chorus and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 8. “The Birches and the Alders.” Soprano solo, Chorus and\r\n    Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 9. String Quartette. C minor.\r\n\r\n  Op. 10. Quartette in E major. (Both rather too broad in their ideas\r\n    for the vehicle of expression.)\r\n\r\n  Op. 12. Six pieces for Piano. (Simple, yet beautiful in expression,\r\n    and showing the composer in a very different field from that of his\r\n    majestic cantatas.)\r\n\r\n  Op. 16. “Loreley.” Grand romantic opera.\r\n\r\n  Op. 19. “Römischer Triumphgesang”; “Wessobrunner Gebet.” Male choruses\r\n    with orchestra; the first has become celebrated.\r\n\r\n  Op. 20. “The Flight of the Holy Family.” (Libretto by Eichendorff.) A\r\n    great work for Chorus and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 22. Does not exist! By a clerical error the Frithjof music was\r\n    numbered Opus 23 instead of 22.\r\n\r\n  Op. 23. “Frithjof.” (See above.)\r\n\r\n  Op. 24. “Schön Ellen”: “Fair Ellen.” (See above.)\r\n\r\n  Op. 25. “Salamis.” Words by Lingg. Male Chorus and Orchestra. One of\r\n    the large choral works; a grand historical tone-poem.\r\n\r\n  Op. 26. Violin Concerto. No. 1. G minor. (See above.)\r\n\r\n  Op. 27. “Frithjof at his Father’s Grave.” Baritone. Female Chorus and\r\n    Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 28. Symphony in E flat.\r\n\r\n  Op. 29. “Rorate Coeli.” Chorus, Orchestra, and Organ. Probably this is\r\n    the loftiest of Bruch’s sacred works.\r\n\r\n  Op. 31. “The Flight into Egypt,” and “Morning Hours.” (By Lingg.)\r\n    Soprano, Female Chorus and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 32. “Normannen-zug.” Baritone, Chorus in unison and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 34. “Römische Leichenfeier”: “Roman Funeral Sacrifice.” Mixed\r\n    Chorus and Orchestra. (Has been erroneously classified as a male\r\n    chorus.)\r\n\r\n  Op. 35. “Kyrie, Sanctus and Agnus Dei.” Choral work.\r\n\r\n  Op. 36. Symphony in F minor.\r\n\r\n  Op. 37. “Song of the German Emperor.” Chorus and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 39. “Dithyrambe.” (Schiller.) Tenor voice, Chorus and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 40. “Hermione.” (“Winter’s Tale.”) Grand Opera.\r\n\r\n  Op. 41. “Odysseus.” (See above.)\r\n\r\n  Op. 43. “Arminius.” A large work for Chorus and Orchestra. Sometimes\r\n    classified as an oratorio.\r\n\r\n  Op. 44. Violin Concerto. No. 2. D minor.\r\n\r\n  Op. 45. “The Song of the Bell.” (Schiller.) Chorus, four solo voices,\r\n    Orchestra and Organ. This is the most ambitious work of the\r\n    composer; by some it is accounted his greatest, but whoever\r\n    undertakes the setting of this masterpiece of a great poet, will\r\n    find his music overshadowed by the grandeur of the poetry.\r\n\r\n  Op. 46. Scotch Fantasie. Violin and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 47. “Kol Nidrei.” A wonderfully effective setting of the ancient\r\n    Hebrew hymn (many believe this to be the oldest piece of Hebrew\r\n    music in existence) for Violoncello and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 50. “Achilleus.” Solo voice, Chorus and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 51. Third Symphony. E major. The most free in form, and the\r\n    brightest in character, of all of Bruch’s symphonies.\r\n\r\n  Op. 52. “The Fiery Cross.” Dramatic Cantata upon portions of Scott’s\r\n    “Lady of the Lake” (arranged by H. Bulthaupt). Solo, Chorus and\r\n    Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 53. “Thermopylae”; “War Song of Tyrtaeus.” Two Male Choruses, with\r\n    Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 54. Songs. (Text by Heyse.) Piano and Violin accompaniment.\r\n\r\n  Op. 55. Canzone. ’Cello and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 56. Adagio on Celtic Melodies. ’Cello and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 57. Adagio Appassionato. Violin and Orchestra.\r\n\r\n  Op. 58. Third Violin Concerto. (D minor.) Dedicated to Joachim.\r\n\r\n  Without Opus number. One Male Chorus, and a set of Hebrew Melodies for\r\n    Chorus, Orchestra and Organ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis C. Elson]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOSEPH RHEINBERGER\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a photograph from life, made by Fr. Muller, in\r\n    Munich._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                       JOSEPH GABRIEL RHEINBERGER\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the more or less prominent German composers of the present time\r\nmay be easily divided in two different classes. On one side we may place\r\nthose who seem to be all their lives in a period of “Sturm und Drang;”\r\nwho are always bitterly in earnest, ever appearing either melancholy or\r\npassionate, always longing and striving for the unattainable, often\r\nmournful, despairing and reticent. These composers present, even in\r\ntheir normal state, gloomy D minor physiognomies, quite in harmony with\r\nthe prevailing pessimistic philosophy. On the opposite side are those\r\nwho look more at the bright and sunny side of life and art, who are the\r\ngood friends and neighbors of their fellow beings, with simpler, quieter\r\nfeelings, perhaps also with less high, less far fetched aspirations, and\r\nwho are less anxious to introduce in every work some new and original\r\nfeature. The musical physiognomies of this class reflect more the\r\npeaceful F, the lively D or the festive E flat keys. To be sure, this is\r\nrather a queer and fanciful generalization of the truth, and the most\r\nremarkable exceptions could be named on either side, both in regard to\r\nthe sincerity of such domineering tendencies and to the degree of\r\nacquired knowledge and ability or inborn talent of the respective\r\ncomposers. There are particularly some of the second class, to whom art\r\nis as high and sacred as it is to the others, and who are worthy of a\r\nmore prominent position, owing to the possession of rare creative powers\r\nand a complete mastery in the use of old and modern means of musical\r\nexpression, as well as of all the different forms of composition. Such a\r\nmaster is Rheinberger. Joseph Gabriel Rheinberger was born the 17th of\r\nMarch, 1839, being the son of a revenue officer in Vaduz, the small\r\ncapital of the principality of Lichtenstein, between Switzerland and\r\nTyrol. At a very early age it became evident that nature had destined\r\nfor him a musical career. He was not five years old, when the piano\r\nlessons of his eldest sister attracted his attention in a way which\r\ninduced her teacher to also begin a musical instruction with the little\r\nboy; and so great and rapid was his progress, both on the pianoforte and\r\nthe organ, that after two years he was competent to fill the position of\r\norganist at the church. Even his productive instincts manifested\r\nthemselves in these tender years, and the little tot of eight years was\r\nallowed to have a short mass in three parts with organ accompaniment of\r\nhis own composition performed at church. Thus his musical vocation was\r\nbeyond all question, and fortunately the best possible professional\r\neducation was granted to him very early in life.\r\n\r\nFrom 1851 till 1854 young Rheinberger was a pupil of the Royal\r\nConservatory at Munich, having as teachers Leonard for the pianoforte,\r\nHerzog for the organ, and Maier for composition. Since then the Bavarian\r\ncapital has been Rheinberger’s second home. When he had graduated with\r\nhigh honors, he took his permanent residence there as a music teacher,\r\nand in 1859 was appointed Leonard’s successor at the Conservatory, which\r\nwas then directed by Hauser, the famous baritone and vocal teacher.\r\nLater on he began teaching composition, a work in which he has won\r\nparticular distinction. In 1865 Hauser was pensioned, the conservatory\r\nreorganized, and Rheinberger appointed as solo-repetitor of the Opera,\r\nbut in 1867, when Bülow assumed the directorship of the newly organized\r\n“Royal Music School,” Rheinberger again received a call as Professor and\r\nInspector at the new institution. This position he has held ever since,\r\nteaching composition and organ. For many years he has also conducted the\r\nMunich Oratorio Society, and after Wüllner’s departure in 1877, for some\r\ntime he led the choir of the Royal Chapel, which was once so justly\r\ncelebrated for its marvelous rendering of unaccompanied choral works,\r\nbut which unfortunately has now disappeared from Munich’s musical life.\r\nRheinberger has been the recipient of many honors, titles and orders,\r\nand is an honorary member of the Berlin Academy of fine Arts, and of\r\nnumberless choral societies in and outside of Germany. Yet he has found\r\nthe most intimate sympathizer with his artistic work in his wife, the\r\npoetess Franziska von Hoffnaass, who has written the text to so many of\r\nhis best known choral works.\r\n\r\nAs Munich has been Rheinberger’s home since boyhood, it may be\r\ninteresting to examine the influence, which the life in this metropolis\r\nof arts, sciences, literature, music and drama, must necessarily have\r\nhad upon the development of his talents. It is well known how much the\r\nmusical life of Munich has changed during the last thirty years. At the\r\ntime of Rheinberger’s arrival there, Franz Lachner stood in the zenith\r\nof his long musical career; he was the highly respected, influential\r\nGeneral Music Director of Bavaria and a representative of the old\r\nstrictly methodical art of composition, and of the old-fashioned,\r\nstrictly objective mode of rendering the works of the classic masters in\r\nthe field of opera and concert. Twelve years later King Max II., who had\r\nsurrounded himself with eminent poets, artists and scientists, was\r\nsucceeded by Ludwig II., the young enthusiastic admirer of R. Wagner and\r\nhis ideas. The great opera reformer was invited to live in Munich and\r\nhis ardent pupil Bülow was appointed as court pianist and director of\r\nthe orchestra and of the new Music School. How soon master and pupil had\r\nto leave Munich again every one knows. Nevertheless their powerful\r\ninfluence remained, especially at the Royal opera house, which became\r\nthe headquarters of Wagner’s music-dramas. The change in the concert\r\nlife was slower. Gradually the musicians and the public were forced to\r\nbecome accustomed to Brahms and other modern composers, whose art rests\r\nmainly upon the classical models, till of late Berlioz and Liszt also\r\nhave found at last a more general recognition.\r\n\r\nBesides Lachner, Wagner and Bülow we may name as the principal\r\nrepresentatives of Munich’s musical life, and the colleagues of\r\nRheinberger during the last thirty years, Peter Cornelius, the long\r\nneglected composer, intendant and composer von Perfall, Max Zenger,\r\ndirectors Wüllner, Levi, Fischer and Porges, the æstheticians Riehl,\r\nNohl and Carrère, the pianists Baermann and Bussmeyer, the violinists\r\nWalter, Abel, Venzl, all the famous singers of the opera and many\r\nothers. Through his position at the opera and at the Music School,\r\nRheinberger stood in a close personal and active relation to almost all\r\nthese men, as well as to this transformation of the musical life of\r\nMunich. Yet it certainly speaks very well in his favor, and honors both\r\nthe originality of his talent and his artistic character, that under all\r\nthese circumstances he has never been untrue to himself and his\r\nindividuality, has never stepped beyond his sphere nor trodden a path\r\nunsuited to him. An early knowledge of his own nature happily protected\r\nhim, and his early acquired thorough technical and theoretical education\r\nstood him in good stead.\r\n\r\nA review of Rheinberger’s published compositions shows at once his great\r\nversatility; no field was neglected by him, in many he has written\r\nexcellent works, in others, if he did not reach the same degree, at\r\nleast his musical skill and fine musicianship awaken our sincere\r\ninterest and high consideration. If he was not in every work guided by\r\ninspiration, his rare knowledge, ability and artistic instinct preserved\r\nhim against failure or triviality. Even in his compositions of smaller\r\nforms the hand of a master is always to be recognized. What a truly\r\nmusical character have his themes, how clever and tasteful is his use of\r\nall the different instrumental or vocal means, how broad and melodic his\r\ncantilena, how fine and charmingly rich and varying his modulations, how\r\nfresh and energetic his rhythm, how well does he understand how to find\r\nthe right tone for the intended mood, and how carefully are all the\r\ndetails finished and connected into a most harmonious whole! Often his\r\npieces give the impression that the composer had really found the truest\r\nexpression and most beautiful form for what he wished to say or\r\nillustrate. Certain chamber works, piano or organ pieces, are so\r\ndelightful, that they awaken a desire for their immediate repetition,\r\nand there are quite a number of his choral compositions which one cannot\r\nhear or sing often enough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOSEPH RHEINBERGER.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph by Karl Lützel, Munich.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs a sincere Catholic, Rheinberger has contributed very considerably to\r\nthe sacred literature of his church, these works being directly intended\r\nfor the service more than for concert purposes. They are partly in a\r\nplain, easy style, and partly on a grander scale, where the composer\r\nfound ample opportunity to show his complete mastery of contrapuntal and\r\npolyphonic art, especially of the fugue. Yet he always keeps himself\r\nfree from uninteresting features and all mere exhibition of learning. A\r\nmood of pious devotion prevails in these works, among the large number\r\nof which special mention must be made of the great mass for double\r\nchorus, dedicated to Pope Leo XIII., two settings of the Stabat Mater\r\nand the Requiem for the victims of the war of 1870–71; besides many\r\nhymns and motets. Of even greater importance are Rheinberger’s\r\ncompositions for the musical instrument of the church, the organ. His\r\nmany sonatas, belong to the most valuable contributions to organ\r\nliterature. They have the usual three or four movements, an intermezzo\r\ntaking the place of the less appropriate scherzo, and a great fugue\r\nforming the finale. And they are by no means tedious, antiquarian\r\nimitations of old masters, but are full of warm, modern sentiment, in\r\nspite of the strictness of form bearing a thoroughly modern physiognomy,\r\nyet never going beyond the limits of dignity, becoming this sacred\r\ninstrument. Some movements have become especially famous and are\r\nfavorite numbers of organ recitals, as for instance, the Passacaglia of\r\nNo. 8. Not less valuable are the many monologues and fughettes and the\r\norgan concerto with accompaniment of strings and horns.\r\n\r\nA review of Rheinberger’s pianoforte compositions may justly be opened\r\nwith his beautiful concerto in A flat, dedicated to Carl Baermann. It is\r\nwritten in a truly symphonic style and contains throughout in its three\r\nextended movements noble and sympathetic music, rich in colors,\r\ncontrasts and climaxes, the orchestra accompaniment being raised to\r\ngreat importance, yet the solo part always remaining brilliant and\r\neffective, especially in the splendid cadenza. The same thorough mastery\r\nof the classic forms also appears in several of the great sonatas for\r\neither two or four hands; yet the old forms breathe all the modern\r\nromantic spirit and even their construction occasionally shows modern\r\ninfluences. Particularly interesting is the great “symphonic sonata,”\r\nopus 47, with a charming minuet and a magnificent tarantella in the last\r\nmovement, the entire work betraying quite a distinct influence of Brahms\r\nand his early sonatas. In tarantellas Rheinberger has been as fertile as\r\nsuccessful, illustration being found in the violin sonata in E flat and\r\nin several independent piano works for two, four, or even eight hands.\r\nThis happy combination of old strict forms with modern expression and\r\nfeeling is also the distinguishing feature of his several toccatas, some\r\nof which require a great virtuosity of playing. And thus it is with his\r\nFugues, Capriccios, Gavottes, Scherzinos, Etudes, etc., while many other\r\npieces such as Humoresken, Romances, Mazurkas or the collections “From\r\nItaly” and “Vacation Pieces” remind us more of the character-pieces\r\nwhich Mendelssohn and Schumann had cultivated. With a Scherzoso and\r\nCapriccio on a theme by Handel, Rheinberger paid a special tribute to\r\nhis admiration of the genius of Brahms, whereas a most interesting\r\nimprovisation on themes from Mozart’s “Magic Flute” bears some\r\nresemblance to Liszt’s virtuoso style, yet showing a decidedly better\r\nmusical workmanship\r\n\r\nIn looking at Rheinberger’s chamber works we at once admire his complete\r\nfamiliarity with the old quartet style, and his eminent skill in\r\ncounterpoint, but these do not hide the bright, charming, sympathetic\r\ncharacter of his music, the energetic life of the allegros, the broad,\r\nsmooth, coherent cantilena of the slow movements, and the grace and\r\nspirit of the Scherzos. Beauty of feeling and sound go most happily hand\r\nin hand. Of the two violin sonatas in E flat major and E minor the\r\nformer has become particularly well known, and the effective treatment\r\nof this string instrument makes us regret that Rheinberger has never\r\nwritten a complete violin concerto in a great symphonic style. He has,\r\nhowever, composed several suites for violin or violoncello with organ.\r\n\r\nIn E flat major, which is apparently a favorite key with our master, are\r\nthe splendid and justly famous pianoforte quartet, opus 38, and the more\r\nrecently written nonet for horn, four string and four wood instruments.\r\nBesides these there are three pianoforte trios, a great pianoforte\r\nquintet in C, a string quintet in A minor, variations for five strings,\r\nand his latest contribution to this class of music, the string quartet\r\nin F. This very remarkable and noble production is distinguished by the\r\nmost masterly treatment of attractive themes, by the charm and grace of\r\nthe middle movements and an unsurpassed skill in the closing fugue.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, that a composer of such prominent qualities both\r\nin regard to the mastery of the old sonata form and the excellent use of\r\nthe different instruments, has written some works for complete\r\norchestra; rather are we surprised that he has not cultivated this field\r\nmore. However his works of this kind are certainly not his best and it\r\nis not unlikely that a clear estimation of his own powers has prevented\r\nhim from further attempts in this field. Of his two symphonic works the\r\nmore recent one entitled “Florentine Symphony” is far less known and\r\nappreciated than the symphonic tone-picture, “Wallenstein,” which was\r\ncomposed much earlier. Both in the old and new world this work still\r\nappears in concert programmes, the part performed most frequently being\r\nthe fascinating Scherzo “Wallenstein’s Camp” with the amusing sermon of\r\nthe garrulous capuchin in the trio. The opening Allegro is superscribed\r\n“Prelude,” the adagio “Thekla,” the finale “Wallenstein’s Death.” The\r\nlatter is unduly long, and without the help of a direct programme hardly\r\ncomprehensible and enjoyable. In spite of the undeniably noble and high\r\npurpose, the marked skill in technical respects and the truly musical\r\ncharacter of the thematic material, we doubt whether Rheinberger, an\r\never growing representative of old theories and absolute music, would\r\nto-day write another such programmatic work. The above mentioned\r\npassacaglia for organ, has, in a most magnificent orchestral\r\narrangement, found a very sympathetic reception in many concert rooms,\r\nand quite often one reads of performances of his overtures to\r\nShakespeare’s “Taming of the Shrew,” and to Schiller’s “Demetrius.”\r\n\r\nWe now approach the theatre, for which Rheinberger has also written. He\r\nwas once connected in a practical way with the operatic stage, and at\r\nthat time composed the incidental music to dramas of Raimund and\r\nCalderon, as well as a great romantic fairy opera, “The Seven Ravens.”\r\nThe writer remembers with pleasure an excellent performance of this\r\ndelightful work at the Munich Opera House, though it was many years ago.\r\nThere was a wealth of beautiful, delicate or strong music full of poetry\r\nand romanticism of a truly fairy character, yet not lacking in stronger\r\ndramatic emotions. This work was followed later on by a comic opera,\r\n“Thürmer’s Töchterlein,” which was quite successfully given on the\r\nMunich stage. The preludes of both operas are often heard in orchestral\r\nconcerts. One of Rheinberger’s most recent works is a little “Singspiel”\r\nfor young folks, in two acts, with piano accompaniment, “das\r\nZauberwort.”\r\n\r\nAt last we reach in our review the field, in which Rheinberger has been\r\nespecially fertile and successful, his many choral compositions. As a\r\nwriter of chorus-ballads, he occupied a similar high position as that\r\nheld by Loewe for solo ballads, and as by far the worthiest successor of\r\nSchumann and Gade, if not in some respects their superior. His choral\r\nworks afford ample opportunity to admire his fine sense for novel,\r\ncharming vocal effects, for a correct, grateful and always effective\r\ntreatment of the human voice, a careful finishing of details, a great\r\nvariety of colors and a distinct and fine characterization of the\r\nvarious moods of the poems. Whenever a piano or orchestra accompaniment\r\nis added, it is most refined, truly musical, and adequately arranged.\r\nMany such happy features could be quoted, but it is impossible to enter\r\nfurther into details. Most of these works do not require a very large\r\nchorus or the mastery of unusual difficulties, and have therefore justly\r\nbecome favorites with smaller choral societies. Others however,\r\nparticularly those for male voices, demand numerous, well-trained voices\r\nand a very thorough study, as their difficulties are quite\r\nextraordinary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph manuscript written by Jos. Rheinberger in Munich\r\n    in 1891.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf the large works for mixed chorus, soli and orchestra, we mention the\r\noften sung cycle of romances, “Toggenburg,” “Montfort” (a saga from the\r\nRhine), “Christoforus” (an old Christian legend), and his latest work,\r\n“The Star of Bethlehem,” a Christmas cantata, the words of all of which\r\nwere written by Rheinberger’s wife, Fanny von Hoffnaass. Less extensive\r\nand with only a pianoforte accompaniment are “King Erich,” “The Willow\r\nTree,” “The Water Sprite,” “The Shepherdess from the Country,” “The Dead\r\nBride,” “May Dew,” “Harald,” “Night,” etc. Of smaller part songs for\r\nmixed voices we mention those contained in the collection, “Love’s\r\nGarden,” and some sacred hymns. Those for male voices are of greater\r\nprominence and rise far above the plane of the conventional\r\n“Liedertafel” style. They are true works of art in every respect, of a\r\nvery noble, interesting and impressive musical character, sweet and\r\ncharacteristic melodically, richly colored and surprisingly original\r\nharmonically, while each one is a real tone-picture, clearly reflecting\r\nthe various poetical moods and situations. Some, too, are quite\r\nextensive and have a piano or orchestral accompaniment, such as the\r\nwonderful “Valley of the Espingo,” “The Roses of Hildesheim,”\r\n“Wittekind,” and “St. John’s Eve.” Most of the part songs, too, are\r\nperfect gems of modern male chorus music, although they are very\r\ndifficult as vocal music and require the most careful preparation.\r\nRheinberger has also written a number of solo songs, some of which in\r\ncyclic form such as “Love’s Life,” “On the Seashore,” etc.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this great number of compositions, we must admit that\r\nRheinberger does not rank as an epoch-making genius in musical history.\r\nBut in sincere admiration and gratitude we recognize that the latest\r\nperiod of German music is not wanting in those whose music reflects the\r\nsunshine and serenity of a clear blue sky, the happiness of a sound\r\nheart and refined mind, whose first purpose it is, by a masterly and\r\nthoughtful use of all musical means of expression, to delight hearers\r\nand performers alike.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is Rheinberger’s position as a composer. We will not,\r\nhowever, forget to do full justice to his eminent ability as a teacher,\r\nwhich enables him to impart to his pupils that thorough and systematic\r\ntheoretical education, which must remain the indispensable basis for the\r\nproductions of even the most gifted composers, especially at a time when\r\nmany are inclined to parade with immature experiments of a fiery, but\r\ninordinate imagination, long before the necessary technical ability\r\ncorresponds with their enthusiastic, and perhaps really worthy\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis Kellerbaum]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a steel engraving made by Krauss, after a\r\n    photograph._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAGNER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                             RICHARD WAGNER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of the great German reformer of the lyric stage is a most\r\ninstructive story. In no respect is it more so than in its illustration\r\nof the fact that genius sometimes requires development, that the\r\naspirations of a young man of promise may be altogether out of the line\r\nof the inspirations of maturity. Wagner began his musical career as the\r\nadmirer and imitator of that which was most popular and facile in the\r\nlyric drama, and became at last the regenerator of that art which some\r\nof his early models had dragged in the mire of time-service and gain.\r\nThere seems to have been a special providence in the utter failure of\r\nhis inartistic attempts, which forced him in his despair to write what\r\nwas in him without hope of pecuniary reward. Destiny drove him toward\r\nthe goal of fame with the stinging whip of adversity.\r\n\r\nWilhelm Richard Wagner was born in Leipsic, May 22, 1813. His father,\r\nFriedrich Wagner, a man of considerable education though simply a police\r\nsuperintendent, died in October of the same year of a nervous fever\r\ncaused by the carnage at the battle of Leipsic. Left with a family of\r\nseven children, of whom Albert, the oldest, was only fourteen, the widow\r\nmarried again. Her second husband was Ludwig Geyer, an actor at the\r\nDresden Court Theatre. He was a man of artistic tastes, a poet, and a\r\nportrait painter, and withal a kindly man, who had a fatherly regard for\r\nhis stepchildren. After removing with his family to Dresden, Geyer died\r\nin 1821, and Wagner was once more without a father. The day before his\r\ndeath Geyer bade little Richard play two simple pieces which he had\r\nlearned to strum on the piano, and said feebly to the mother, “Has he\r\nperchance a talent for music?” The next day, when the stepfather lay\r\ndead, Wagner’s mother said to him, “He hoped to make something of thee.”\r\nAnd the composer adds in his autobiographic sketch, “I remember, too,\r\nthat for a long time I imagined that something indeed would come of me.”\r\n\r\nIn his ninth year Wagner went to the Kreuzschule, where he studied\r\nGreek, Latin, mythology, and ancient history, and in secret worshipped\r\nWeber, whom he saw daily passing by. The boy received some piano\r\nlessons, but beguiled his time with attempts to play “Der Freischütz”\r\noverture with “fearful fingering.” He never became a good pianist. More\r\nimportant for his future were his poetic studies. On the death of a\r\nschoolfellow he wrote a lament which was printed. He made a metrical\r\ntranslation of Romeo’s monologue, and he built a terrible tragedy,\r\ncompounded of “Lear” and “Hamlet,” in which forty-two persons died, most\r\nof them returning as ghosts to finish the play. In 1828 he left Dresden\r\nand entered the Nicolaischule in Leipsic. At the Gewandhaus concerts he\r\nheard Beethoven’s music. The effect he afterwards described thus: “One\r\nevening I heard, for the first time, a Beethoven symphony. I then fell\r\nsick of a fever, and when I recovered I found myself a musician.” He\r\ntried to write music for one of his tragedies, but discovered that he\r\nneeded instruction. Gottlieb Müller tried to teach him, but found his\r\npupil too wilful. His wilfulness, however, secured the performance of an\r\noverture at the theatre in 1830. The public laughed at it because of the\r\npersistent thumping of the bass drum. Fortunately he realized his lack\r\nof knowledge, and applied to Theodore Weinlig, cantor at the\r\nThomasschule. Weinlig led him in the right direction, and in less than\r\nsix months dismissed him as competent to “solve with ease the hardest\r\nproblems of counterpoint.” The immediate results of this course were an\r\noverture, applauded at a Gewandhaus concert, and a symphony in C major,\r\nmodelled on Beethoven and Mozart.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 he wrote his first opera libretto, “Die Hochzeit” (“The\r\nWedding”), the music for which he abandoned after a few numbers. In 1833\r\nhe visited his brother Albert, tenor and stage manager at the Würzburg\r\ntheatre, and accepted the position of chorus master. He now had leisure\r\nto write another opera. This was “Die Feen” (“The Fairies”), founded on\r\nGozzi’s “La Donna Serpente.” Beethoven, Weber, and Marschner were his\r\nmodels. The work was accepted by Ringelhardt, of the Leipsic Theatre,\r\nbut not produced. It was resurrected, however, in 1891, and was\r\nperformed ten times in Germany. In 1834, Wagner heard Wilhelmina\r\nSchroeder-Devrient sing in Bellini’s “Montecchi e Capuletti,” and her\r\npower as an actress seems to have set his mind to work on the\r\npossibility of an intimate union of music with acting. A performance of\r\n“Massaniello,” with its quick succession of incidents, completed the\r\nformulation of his idea of the road to success. As Adolphe Jullien\r\nremarks, his object was “first to imagine an animated scene of action,\r\nthen to write music easy to sing, and of a nature to catch the public\r\near.” He now began his second opera, “Das Liebesverbot” (“The Love\r\nVeto”), based on Shakespeare’s “Measure for Measure,” but so altered as\r\nto become practically a glorification of free love.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD WAGNER’S BIRTHPLACE IN LEIPSIC.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1834 he secured the post of musical director at the Magdeburg\r\nTheatre, and there, in the season of 1835–36, he produced his new work\r\nafter only ten days’ rehearsals. The result was failure, penury, and\r\ndebt. In Magdeburg he fell in love with Wilhelmina Planer, an actress,\r\nand following her to Königsberg, when she was engaged there, he became\r\nconductor at the theatre. On Nov. 24, 1834, they were married. In 1837\r\nhe read Bulwer’s “Rienzi,” and conceived the idea of using it as an\r\nopera plot. In the fall of that year he became conductor at Riga, where\r\nin 1838 he finished his libretto and began the music. He now wrote\r\nwithout hope of an immediate production, but with a view to future\r\nperformance at some theatre of large resources. His mental eye, however,\r\nfixed itself on Paris, and his “Rienzi” began to develop along lines\r\nsuggested by the popular composers of the time, Spontini, Meyerbeer,\r\nBellini, and Rossini. In 1839 he and his wife started for Paris, by way\r\nof London, on a sailing ship. Stormy weather and the legend of “The\r\nFlying Dutchman,” told by the sailors, sowed in his mind seed which grew\r\nand subsequently blossomed. At Boulogne he became acquainted with\r\nMeyerbeer, who gave him letters to Parisians of note in music, and in\r\nSeptember, 1839, he arrived in the French capital.\r\n\r\n“Das Liebesverbot” was accepted by Jolly, director of the Renaissance\r\nTheatre, which went into bankruptcy before the work was rehearsed.\r\nWagner wrote “A Faust Overture,” which also failed to come to a\r\nperformance, and other attempts were fruitless. He was now reduced to\r\narranging music for a publisher, and contributing to a musical journal.\r\nHe wrote at this time some charming songs and his notable article, “A\r\nPilgrimage to Beethoven,” and he worked hard at his “Rienzi.” An\r\noverture, “Columbus,” was played, but was not liked. He tried to get a\r\nposition as a chorus singer at a small theatre, but was rejected. In\r\n“the last stage of his misery,” Meyerbeer arrived, and Leon Pillet,\r\nunder his influence, allowed Wagner to have hopes of preparing a work\r\nfor the Grand Opéra. He wrote a sketch of the book of “Der Fliegende\r\nHolländer” (“The Flying Dutchman”), and to his disgust, Pillet proposed\r\nto buy it of him and have some one else write the music. Finally,\r\nreserving the German rights, he did sell the sketch to Pillet for five\r\nhundred francs. Then he wrote the libretto and began to compose his own\r\nfine music. He had not composed for so long a time that he doubted his\r\npowers. “As soon as the piano had arrived,” he writes, “my heart beat\r\nfast for very fear; I dreaded to discover that I had ceased to be a\r\nmusician. I began first with the ‘Sailors’ Chorus’ and the ‘Spinning\r\nSong’; everything sped along as though on wings, and I shouted for joy\r\nas I felt within me that I still was a musician.” His sketch, sold to\r\nPillet, was made into a French opera under the title of “Le Vaisseau\r\nFantôme,” music by Dietsch, and failed signally. Wagner, taking no\r\nthought for the future, but working according to his own artistic\r\nimpulses, completed his own version in seven weeks, and began to develop\r\nthe system which was to remodel opera. In the mean time “Rienzi” had\r\nbeen accepted by the Dresden Court Theatre, and early in 1842 the\r\n“Holländer” was accepted. “As regards Paris itself,” he writes, “I was\r\ncompletely without prospects for several years; I therefore left it in\r\nthe spring of 1842. For the first time I saw the Rhine; with hot tears\r\nin my eyes, I, poor artist, swore eternal fidelity to my German\r\nfatherland.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LUDWIG GEYER.\r\n\r\n  Reproduction of a portrait painted by himself. Original now in\r\n    possession of the Brockhaus family in Leipsic.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Rienzi” was produced on Oct. 20, 1842, with the following cast: Rienzi,\r\nTichatschek; Irene, Frl. Wüst; Stefano, Dettmer; Adriano, Mme.\r\nSchroeder-Devrient; Paolo, Wachter; Raimondo, Rheinhold; Baroncelli,\r\nVestri; Cecco, Risse; Messenger, Frl. Thiele. The opera achieved an\r\nimmediate and emphatic success, which fifty years of popularity have\r\napproved. “Der Fliegende Holländer” was now hurried upon the stage, and\r\nproduced at Dresden, Jan. 2, 1843, with Schroeder-Devrient as Senta, and\r\nMitterwurzer as Vanderdecken. The great change in style from “Rienzi,”\r\nthe sombreness of the story, the simplicity of the action, and the\r\noriginality of the music surprised and disappointed the public. Only\r\nSpohr seemed to perceive its real value. He said, “Among composers for\r\nthe stage _pro tem._, Wagner is the most gifted.” Spohr produced the\r\n“Holländer” at Cassel on June 5, 1843, and was to the end an admirer of\r\nWagner.\r\n\r\nImmediately after finishing this work in Paris, Wagner cast about for\r\nnew material. He read a new version of the story of “Tannhäuser,” which\r\nset him to work to trace to its source the connection of this tale with\r\nthat of the Wartburg song contest. Thus he came to read “Der\r\nWartburgkrieg,” which introduces the story of “Lohengrin,” and Wolfram\r\nvon Eschenbach’s “Parzival”; “and thus,” as he says, “an entirely new\r\nworld of poetical matter suddenly opened before me.” Before the\r\nrehearsals of “Rienzi” he began the book of “Tannhäuser.” He completed\r\nthe opera (though he afterwards made some changes) on April 13, 1844. In\r\nthe mean time (January, 1843) he was made court conductor at Dresden,\r\nwhere he served seven years, producing the masterpieces of Gluck,\r\nMozart, Weber, Mendelssohn, Beethoven, Spontini, and even Palestrina in\r\nthe most artistic manner. He produced “Tannhäuser” at Dresden, Oct. 19,\r\n1845, with Tichatschek in the title rôle; Schroeder-Devrient as Venus;\r\nhis niece, Johanna Wagner, as Elizabeth; and Mitterwurzer, as Wolfram.\r\nThe work pleased neither the public nor the critics. The music, except\r\nthe simple broad march and chorus of Act. II., was pronounced ugly. Even\r\nthe mellifluous “Evening Star” song was disliked; Tannhäuser’s dramatic\r\nstory of his pilgrimage was called “a pointless and empty recitation,”\r\nand Wagner was blamed for not marrying his hero and heroine. Even Spohr,\r\nthough he saw much that was “new and beautiful,” was troubled. Schumann\r\nalone declared of the work: “It contains deeper, more original, and\r\naltogether an hundred-fold better things than his previous operas; at\r\nthe same time, a good deal that is musically trivial.” Wagner was\r\ndiscouraged, but instead of losing faith in his ideals, he decided on a\r\ncourse of literary propagandism: “to induce the public to understand and\r\nparticipate in my aims as an artist.” From this resolve sprang his\r\nsubsequent theoretical writings: “Art and Revolution” (1849), “The Art\r\nWork of the Future” (1850), “Opera and Drama” (1851), etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD WAGNER’S MOTHER.\r\n\r\n  Reproduction of a portrait painted by Ludwig Geyer. Original now in\r\n    possession of the Brockhaus family in Leipsic.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBefore the production of “Tannhäuser,” he had made sketches for the\r\nbooks of “Lohengrin” and “Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg” (“The\r\nMastersingers of Nuremberg”). He finished the former work in March,\r\n1848. In the mean time failure had brought debt and trouble upon him.\r\nEven his wife, though an admirable woman in other respects, did not\r\ncomprehend his intellect, and grieved at his preference of artistic\r\nworks over paying operas of the familiar sort. Restless and irritated,\r\nhe plunged into the revolutionary movement and gave utterance to radical\r\nopinions, even arguing in a lecture that the king ought to proclaim\r\nSaxony a free state. In May, 1849, Dresden streets were barricaded\r\nagainst troops sent to disperse rioters, and in spite of assertions to\r\nthe contrary, there is good evidence that Wagner was fighting on the\r\npeople’s side.[1] The Prussian troops scattered the revolutionists, and\r\nWagner fled to Weimar, where he was received with open arms by Franz\r\nLiszt, thenceforward his most devoted friend. The police were on his\r\ntrack, however, and he hastened by way of Paris to Zurich, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nWagner’s exile lasted from 1849 till 1861, and this period embraces the\r\nclimax of his creative labors. He began his career as a citizen of\r\nZurich by pouring forth a long series of literary works, of which those\r\nabove mentioned and “Judaism in Music” may be regarded as the most\r\nimportant. There will be occasion to speak later of those bearing on his\r\noperatic ideas, but the “Judaism” article produced bitter comment at the\r\ntime, and has remained a source of offence to many. It was published in\r\nthe _Neue Zeitschrift für Musik_, over the _nom de plume_ K. Freigedank.\r\nThe chief contentions of the article were that the Jews, being of no\r\nnation, but of all nations, are without national feeling; that their art\r\nwork, especially in music, lacks that genuineness which is one of the\r\nproducts of nationality; and that an instinct for gain causes them to\r\nsacrifice pure art for the profitable fashion of the time. His examples\r\nwere Mendelssohn and Meyerbeer, the latter of whom he again censured in\r\n“Opera and Drama.” The authorship of the strictures on the Jews was\r\nspeedily suspected, and a host of pamphlets appeared in answer to it.\r\nThe principal result was that Wagner’s writings sold well. In a letter\r\nwritten in 1847 he declared that he esteemed Meyerbeer as a man, but as\r\na composer viewed him as the embodiment of “all that is repellent in the\r\nincoherency and empty striving after outward effect of the operatic\r\nmusic of the day.” This was his only answer to the charge that he had\r\nrepaid Meyerbeer’s early assistance with ingratitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VILLA TRIEBSCHEN.\r\n\r\n  Richard Wagner’s Residence on Lake Lucerne, where the “Meistersinger,”\r\n    “Rheingold,” and “Götterdämmerung” were composed.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHis opera, “Lohengrin,” was produced by Liszt at Weimar, Aug. 28, 1850,\r\nwith the following cast: Lohengrin, Beck; Telramund, Milde; King Henry,\r\nHöfer; Elsa, Frl.

It was received very\r\nmuch as “Tannhäuser” had been, but it gradually won its way through\r\nGermany, being brought out at Wiesbaden in 1853, Leipzic, Schwerin,\r\nFrankfurt, Darmstadt, Breslau, and Stettin, in 1854; Cologne, Hamburg,\r\nRiga, and Prague, 1855; Munich and Vienna, in 1858; Berlin and Dresden,\r\n1859. In the mean time Wagner was laboring on the largest, if not the\r\ngreatest, of his works, “Der Ring des Nibelungen” (“The Nibelung’s\r\nRing”). In 1848 he had considered two subjects, the story of Frederick\r\nBarbarossa and that of Siegfried, the hero of the “Nibelungen Lied.” The\r\nlatter was his choice, and he wrote an essay entitled “Der Nibelungen\r\nMythus als Entwurf zu einem Drama” (“The Nibelung Myth as Subject for a\r\nDrama”). Immediately afterward, in the fall of 1848, he wrote\r\n“Siegfried’s Tod” (“Siegfried’s Death”) in three acts and a prologue,\r\nand even conceived some of the musical ideas for the setting. In May,\r\n1850, he had this poem printed and read parts of it as illustrations in\r\na lecture on the music-drama delivered at Zurich. The prospects of\r\n“Lohengrin” moved him to take it up again, and we find him writing to\r\nLiszt thus:—\r\n\r\n“You offer to me the artistic association which might bring ‘Siegfried’\r\nto light. I demand representatives of heroes, such as our stage has not\r\nyet seen; where are they to come from? Not from the air, but from the\r\nearth, for I believe you are in a good way to make them grow from the\r\nearth by dint of your inspiring care.... Well, then, as soon as you have\r\nproduced ‘Lohengrin’ to your own satisfaction, I shall also produce my\r\n‘Siegfried,’ but only for you and for Weimar. Two days ago I should not\r\nhave believed that I should come to this resolution; I owe it to\r\nyou.”[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WAHNFRIED.\r\n\r\n  The home of Richard Wagner in Bayreuth. From a photograph.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe immediately subsequent letters are full of his determination soon to\r\nbegin work on “Siegfried’s Death”; but when he attempted it, he found\r\nthat there was too much explanatory matter, and he decided to embody\r\nthat in a prefatory drama to be called “Young Siegfried.” Here again,\r\nhowever, he found the same difficulty, and on Nov. 20, 1851, he writes\r\nto Liszt that “this ‘Young Siegfried’ also is no more than a fragment.”\r\nHe continues thus:—\r\n\r\n“Two principal motives of my myth, therefore, remain to be represented,\r\nboth of which are hinted at in ‘Young Siegfried,’ the first in the long\r\nnarrative of Brünnhilde after her awakening (Act III.), and the second\r\nin the scene between Alberich and the Wanderer in the second act, and\r\nbetween the Wanderer and Mime in the first. That to this I was led not\r\nonly by artistic reflection, but by the splendid and, for the purpose of\r\nrepresentation, extremely rich material of these motives, you will\r\nreadily understand when you consider the subject more closely. Think\r\nthen of the wondrously fatal love of Siegmund and Sieglinde, of Wotan,\r\nin his deep, mysterious relation to that love, in his dispute with\r\nFricka, in his terrible self-contention when, for the sake of custom, he\r\ndecrees the death of Siegmund; finally of the glorious Valkyrie\r\nBrünnhilde, as, divining the innermost thought of Wotan, she disobeys\r\nthe god, and is punished by him; consider this wealth of motive\r\nindicated in the scene between the Wanderer and the Wala, and at greater\r\nlength in the above-mentioned tale of Brünnhilde, as the material of a\r\ndrama which precedes the two ‘Siegfrieds’; and you will understand that\r\nit was not reflection, but rather enthusiasm, which inspired my latest\r\nplan. That plan extends to three dramas: (1) ‘The Valkyrie’; (2) ‘Young\r\nSiegfried’; (3) ‘Siegfried’s Death.’ In order to give everything\r\ncompletely, these three dramas must be preceded by a grand introductory\r\nplay, ‘The Rape of the Rhinegold.’ The object is the complete\r\nrepresentation of everything in regard to this rape; the origin of the\r\nNibelung treasure, the possession of that treasure by Wotan, and the\r\ncurse of Alberich, which in ‘Young Siegfried’ occur in the form of\r\nnarration.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD WAGNER’S STUDIO IN BAYREUTH.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph of a painting by R. Steche.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus we find him impelled by the demands as well as the artistic\r\npossibilities of a fruitful story to the construction of his great\r\ntetralogy, consisting of the dramas eventually named “Das Rheingold”\r\n(“The Rhinegold”), “Die Walküre” (“The Valkyrie”), “Siegfried,” and “Die\r\nGötterdämmerung” (“The Dusk of the Gods”). A further incentive to the\r\ncreation of this four-part work was his belief that the true lyric play\r\nshould be modelled after the Greek drama, in whose literature he found\r\nthe trilogy of Æschylus—the “Agamemnon,” “Chœphoræ,” and “Eumenides” and\r\n“The Seven against Thebes,” believed to have been the final play of a\r\ntetralogy. He began to labor at this gigantic undertaking without any\r\ndefinite hope of its performance; indeed, with doubts as to his living\r\nto complete it. So great, however, was his enthusiasm that, in spite of\r\nthe formidable artistic problems which he had to solve and the novelty\r\nand complexity of his own musico-dramatic system, now to be developed\r\nfor the first time to its logical outcome, he had the poem completed and\r\nprinted for private circulation early in 1853.[3]\r\n\r\n“During the summer of 1853 he visited a place near Saint Maurice, and\r\nfrom there he undertook a trip into the North of Italy.... It was during\r\na sleepless night at Spezzia that the first ideas of the ‘Rheingold’\r\nmusic passed through his mind. He brought his journey to an end, and\r\nhastened to regain his tranquil home at Zurich, that he might not\r\ncommence such a work on Italian soil.”[4] The score of “Das Rheingold”\r\nwas completed in May, 1854. The next month he began “Die Walküre” and\r\nfinished all save the instrumentation in the winter of 1854–55. The\r\nscore was done in 1856, and in 1857 most of the first two acts of\r\n“Siegfried” were composed and orchestrated. His labors had been\r\ninterrupted by the production of “Tannhäuser” at Zurich in 1855, by a\r\nvisit from his best of friends, Liszt, and by a journey to London to\r\nconduct the concerts of the Philharmonic Society from March to June,\r\n1855. He felt that he must accept this engagement or, as he said in a\r\nletter to Praeger, “renounce the public and all relations with it once\r\nand for all.”[5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BAYREUTH HILL AND THE THEATRE OF THE FESTIVALS.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA more important interruption, however, was to come. In 1851, Arthur\r\nSchopenhauer’s “Parerga und Paralipomena” was published, and created a\r\nsensation which called attention to his earlier philosophical work, “The\r\nWorld as Will and Representation” (1818), hitherto unnoticed in the\r\nglare of Hegel’s and Schelling’s success. Wagner plunged into\r\nSchopenhauer’s pessimistic philosophy with ardor. At the same time he\r\nwas reading Godfrey von Strassburg’s “Tristan,” and conceived the idea\r\nof embodying Schopenhauer’s pessimism in a story of unhappy passion. He\r\nread Strassburg’s poem to Praeger, who was visiting him, and spoke of\r\nits adaptability to operatic treatment. The next morning at breakfast,\r\nin a fit of abstraction, he conceived some of the love music. Now the\r\ndesire seized him to write a work which could be completed and produced.\r\nMoreover he needed money. And to end all, a mysterious agent appeared\r\nwith a commission for an opera from the Emperor of Brazil. Wagner\r\nhesitated about the commission, but he began “Tristan and Isolde.” He\r\nfinished the poem early in 1857, the music of the first act in the\r\nwinter, the second act in Venice, March 2, 1859, and the third act in\r\nLyons, August, 1859.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE GRAND CANAL, VENICE, SHOWING RESIDENCE OF RICHARD WAGNER.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year he went to Paris with a faint hope of\r\ngetting the new work, or one of his earlier ones, produced. M. Carvalho,\r\nof the Théâtre-Lyrique, was favorably inclined toward “Tannhäuser,” but\r\nafraid. Wagner gave a concert and lost money. Then help came from an\r\nunexpected quarter. Under the persuasion of the Princess de Metternich\r\nthe Emperor ordered a production of “Tannhäuser” at the Grand Opéra. The\r\ntext was translated into French, a great number of rehearsals was held,\r\n$40,000 were spent on the mounting, and Wagner was allowed to select his\r\nown singers. The cast he chose was as follows: Tannhäuser, Niemann;\r\nElizabeth, Mlle. Saxe; Venus, Mlle. Tedesco; the Shepherd, Mlle. Reboux;\r\nthe Landgrave, Cazaux; and Wolfram, Morelli. In his first interview with\r\nthe director of the Opera, Wagner was informed that a ballet in the\r\nsecond act was an absolute necessity, because the subscribers, chiefly\r\nmembers of the Jockey Club, never arrived till the middle of the\r\nevening, and they demanded a ballet at that time for their especial\r\ndelectation. Wagner refused to introduce a meaningless dance into his\r\nsecond act, but “saw in the first act, at the luxurious court of Venus,\r\na most perfect opportunity for a choreographic scene of some real\r\nmeaning.”[6] In accordance with this idea he rewrote the Venus scene,\r\narranging what is now known as the Paris version of “Tannhäuser.” M.\r\nAdolphe Jullien’s account of the production on March 13, 1861, and the\r\nensuing performances (Chap. VIII.) is careful and candid; and it settles\r\nconclusively the fact that the failure of the work was due to the\r\npersistent opposition of the members of the Jockey Club, who blew\r\nhunting whistles, indulged in hisses and catcalls, and otherwise made\r\nsuch a disturbance that the work did not get a fair hearing. Wagner\r\nwithdrew it after three performances, in spite of the increase of\r\nreceipts, which ran as follows: first, 7,491 francs (subscription,\r\n2,790); second, 8,415 francs (subscription, 2,758); third, 10,764 francs\r\n(subscription, 230). The smallness of the subscription at the third\r\nperformance is accounted for by its having been given on Sunday night in\r\norder to get rid of the irate subscribers, who, nevertheless, went _en\r\nmasse_, buying admission tickets. Wagner fully comprehended the meaning\r\nof it all. “Never,” he said, “have I been in the least disposed to doubt\r\nthe Parisian public when it is upon an impartial ground.”\r\n\r\nThrough the intercession of the Princess de Metternich he received\r\npermission in 1861 to return to Germany. The succeeding three years,\r\nowing to the smallness of the royalties on his operas, were years of\r\npecuniary distress. His hopes in “Tristan” were shattered, for after\r\nfifty-seven rehearsals at Vienna it was shelved as impracticable. In\r\n1861 (May 15) at Vienna he had the pleasure of hearing “Lohengrin” for\r\nthe first time. He was encouraged to begin a new work, and he took up\r\nhis old sketch of “Die Meistersinger” made in 1845. In “Tannhäuser” he\r\nhad drawn a picture of a contest of song among knightly minnesingers; in\r\nthis comic opera he gave a humorous representation of a contest among\r\nthe common people. In the winter of 1861–62 he finished the libretto,\r\nthough he afterwards made alterations. He went to a little place\r\nopposite Mayence to work on the music. He gave a number of concerts to\r\nkeep the wolf from the door, and in 1864 published the poem of “Der Ring\r\ndes Nibelungen” with a pathetic renunciation of all hope of living to\r\nsee it completed or performed. Pecuniary distress finally broke his\r\nspirit, and in 1864 he accepted an invitation to live in Switzerland. He\r\nwas on his way thither when his earthly providence intervened.\r\n\r\nThis providence was the young King Ludwig II. of Bavaria, a sincere\r\nlover of art and a warm admirer of Wagner. Hardly had he mounted the\r\nthrone before he sent a messenger after the composer with the words,\r\n“Come here and finish your work.” Wagner’s joy may be imagined. He went\r\nto Munich, where he was provided with a stipend of $500 a year from the\r\nking’s private purse. One of the musician’s first acts was to compose\r\nhis familiar “Huldigungs Marsch” (“March of Allegiance”). He received\r\nthe royal order to complete the “Nibelungen” in the fall of 1864; his\r\nallowance was increased, and a house given him. The king began to talk\r\nabout building a theatre for the production of the tetralogy; “Tristan\r\nund Isolde” was put in preparation, and Hans von Bülow was summoned to\r\nconduct it. On June 10, 1865, this formidable work was produced in exact\r\naccordance with the composer’s ideas. The original cast was as follows:\r\nTristan, Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld; Isolde, Frau Schnorr von\r\nCarolsfeld; King Mark, Zottmayer; Kurvenal, Mitterwurzer; Melot,\r\nHeinrich; Brangäne, Frl. Deinet; Shepherd, Simons; Steersman, Hartmann.\r\nIn December, 1865, the composer went to live at the Villa Triebschen, on\r\nLake Lucerne, where he finished “Die Meistersinger,” twenty-two years\r\nafter he had made the first sketch. It was produced under Von Bülow at\r\nMunich on June 21, 1868, with these principals: Eva, Frl. Mallinger;\r\nMagdalena, Frau Dietz; Hans Sachs, Betz; Walther, Nachbauer; David,\r\nSchlosser; Beckmesser, Hölzel. While at Triebschen he also continued his\r\nwork on the “Nibelungen,” and in June, 1870, had finished the first act\r\nof “Die Götterdämmerung.”\r\n\r\nIt was in this year that he married a second time. His first wife had\r\nnever understood his artistic ideas, and the two were wholly without\r\nsympathy, though Wagner never ceased to speak with kindness of Mina. His\r\nprofessional intercourse with Von Bülow led to his intimate acquaintance\r\nwith Cosima von Bülow, the daughter of Liszt. Wagner found in her the\r\ncomprehension and sympathy which he craved. Mina was unable to endure\r\nthe supremacy of the more brilliant woman, and in 1861 left her husband\r\nand went to Dresden. She died in 1866, and in 1870, Cosima, having\r\nsecured a divorce from Von Bülow, became Mme. Wagner, destined to\r\nsurvive her husband and perpetuate his triumphs.\r\n\r\nNow began the remarkable series of events with which Wagner’s career\r\nculminated. The king abandoned his idea of building a Wagner theatre in\r\nMunich, and the composer selected Bayreuth as a place adapted, by reason\r\nof its seclusion, to the consummation of his ambitious plans. Money had\r\nto be raised, and Emil Heckel, of Mannheim, conceived the notion of\r\nWagner Societies. The success of his scheme was beyond expectation. Such\r\norganizations were founded all over the world—even in Milan and New\r\nYork—and more than $200,000 was subscribed. Wagner settled in Bayreuth\r\nin April, 1872, and on May 22 gave a concert to celebrate the beginning\r\nof the building of the theatre. The music of the tetralogy was finished\r\nin November, 1874, and rehearsals were begun under Hans Richter. The\r\nfirst performances were given on Aug. 13, 14, 16, and 17. The work was\r\ntwice repeated in the same month. The principals were: Wotan, Betz;\r\nLoge, Vogel; Alberich, Hill; Mime, Schlosser; Fricka, Frau Grün; Donner\r\nand Gunther, Gura; Erda and Waltraute, Frau Jaïde; Siegmund, Niemann;\r\nSieglinde, Frl. Schefzky; Brünnhilde, Frau Materna; Siegfried, Unger;\r\nHagen, Siehr; Gutrune, Frl. Weckerlin; Rhinedaughters, Frl. Lili and\r\nMarie Lehmann and Frl. Lambert; concert-master, Wilhemj; conductor, Hans\r\nRichter. The performances, like all successive festivals at Bayreuth,\r\nattracted music lovers from all over the world and called forth volumes\r\nof criticism, favorable and bitterly unfavorable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PALAZZO VENDRAMIN, VENICE, WHERE RICHARD WAGNER DIED.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA very large deficit caused Wagner to try the experiment of grand\r\nconcerts in London in 1877; but he made only $3,000 out of that venture.\r\nWagner’s last work was now well under way. Early in life, as already\r\nnoted, he had read Wolfram von Eschenbach’s “Parzival,” and in 1857, at\r\nZurich, he began his own “Parsifal,” with a sketch of the Good Friday\r\nmusic. The completed libretto was published Dec. 25, 1877. The sketch of\r\nthe first act was finished early in 1878, and the whole was completed\r\nApril 25, 1879. The instrumentation was finished at Palermo, Jan. 13,\r\n1882.[7] The first performance took place at Bayreuth on July 25, 1882,\r\nand the work was given altogether sixteen times that summer. The\r\nperformers who alternated in the principal parts were as follows:\r\nParsifal, Winklemann, Gudehus, and Jäger; Kundry, Materna, Brandt, and\r\nMalten; Gurnemanz, Scaria and Siehr; Amfortas, Reichmann and Fuchs;\r\nKlingsor, Hill, Degele, and Plank. Conductors, Hermann Levi and Franz\r\nFischer. “Parsifal” was assailed fiercely by the now numerous opponents\r\nof Wagner’s musical system, but it has continued to draw great crowds to\r\nBayreuth years after its creator’s death. The power of this and the\r\nother dramas was due not only to their inherent truth and beauty, but\r\nalso to the manner of their production. As an American newspaper\r\ncorrespondent (W. S. B. Mathews) wrote:—\r\n\r\n“‘Parsifal,’ as here given, is a revelation. The performance is of such\r\na consistently elevated character, and so evenly carried out in every\r\ndepartment, as to make one realize that in his whole life he has never\r\nbefore witnessed an artistic presentation of opera.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LUIGI TREVISAN.\r\n\r\n  Richard Wagner’s Venetian Gondolier. Drawn by Giacomo Favretto.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1882, Wagner went to live in Venice. His health had\r\nbeen failing. He recuperated sufficiently to conduct a performance of\r\nhis youthful Symphony in C; but on Tuesday, Feb. 13, 1883, as M. Jullien\r\nrelates, “as he was about to step into his gondola, some discussion\r\narose, and he gave way to a fit of anger; suddenly he started up from\r\nhis seat, choking, and cried, ‘I feel very badly!’ He fell fainting.\r\nThey carried him to his bed, and when his physician, Dr. Keppler,\r\narrived, in all haste, he found him dead in the arms of his wife, who\r\nbelieved him sleeping.” On Feb. 18 he was buried in the garden of his\r\nvilla, “Wahnfried” (“Fulfillment of Ideal”), at Bayreuth. He left one\r\nson, Siegfried, the fruit of his second union.\r\n\r\nThis outline of a remarkable career, in which artistic success was\r\npursued by pecuniary embarrassment, in which envy, malice, and\r\nvituperation barked at the heels of progressive intellect, will best be\r\nclosed by the quotation of a few lines concerning the man’s personality.\r\nM. Jullien, who writes with kindness and yet with candor, says:—\r\n\r\n“The most striking thing about Richard Wagner, at first sight, was the\r\nextraordinary life and energy which animated this insignificant body,\r\nsurmounted by a very large head, with an enormous frontal\r\ndevelopment.... His bright eyes and pleasant glance softened the\r\nstrongly marked face, and his mouth, notwithstanding the undue\r\nprominence of nose and chin, had a singular expression of sweetness and\r\naffability. With his extreme rapidity of movement, gait, and gesture, he\r\ngave from the first an impression of unusual and powerful originality;\r\nhe fascinated by his conversation, so animated was he on all subjects\r\nwhich interested him, and he always acted out his discourse. He was\r\nviolent, even explosive in temper; with him gayety, like wrath, was\r\ntempestuous and overflowing.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD WAGNER\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a photograph from life, made in 1877, by Elliott &\r\n    Fry in London._\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Dannreuther, who knew him well, testifies that he was most amiable\r\namong his friends, with whom he was a very different person from “the\r\naggressive critic and reformer who addressed himself to the public.”\r\nThere is no doubt that Wagner was fully convinced of the tremendous\r\nimportance of his own work, and that he developed to its fullest extent\r\nthe exasperating egotism of a man whose whole soul is absorbed in his\r\naims. He was intolerant of opposition, and ungenerous in his views of\r\nother musicians. He was dogmatic in style, even when most logical in\r\nthought; and like many another genius, he had some very small\r\nweaknesses, such as a sybaritic love for silk and satin clothing, and a\r\nbelief that the world ought to gratefully pay the expenses of his\r\nsupport while he completed his great works. With all his peculiarities,\r\nwhich were largely the outcome of his fierce struggle for recognition,\r\nhe possessed “a simple kindness of heart, an extreme sensibility.” As to\r\nhis manner of work, Dr. Praeger has given testimony:—\r\n\r\n“Wagner composed at the piano, in an elegantly well-arranged studio.\r\nWith him composing was a work of excitement and much labor.... He\r\nlabored excessively. Not to find or make up a phrase; no, he did not\r\nseek his ideas at the piano. He went to the piano with his idea already\r\ncomposed, and made the piano his sketch book wherein he worked and\r\nreworked his subject, steadily modelling his matter until it assumed the\r\nshape he had in his mind.”\r\n\r\nThe names, dates of production, and principal singers of his\r\nmusic-dramas have already been given, together with some mention of his\r\nminor compositions. An overture (“Faust”), three marches, the “Siegfried\r\nIdyll,” built on themes from the drama, a chorus, a male quartet, a\r\nfuneral march for Weber, five piano pieces, a few lovely songs (two of\r\nthem studies for “Tristan” music), and nearly a dozen arrangements\r\n(among them piano scores of “La Favorita,” and “L’Elisir d’Amore,”\r\npathetic mementoes of his starving days in Paris), are the musical\r\nremains of this genius, outside of his operatic works. The lyric stage\r\nwas the theatre of his career, and in the works prepared for it he\r\nexpended the force of his intellect, and developed the ideas that\r\nproclaim him an epoch-maker. Let us, therefore, turn our attention to\r\nthe Wagner theories, and their practical exposition in the so-called\r\n“music of the future,” which has become so intensely that of the\r\npresent. What is the Wagnerian theory of the opera? How does it differ\r\nfrom that which preceded it? From what germs did Wagner develop it? How\r\nhas he embodied it? These are questions which naturally arise, and which\r\ndemand answers.\r\n\r\nIt may well be questioned whether Wagner had a wholly comprehensive view\r\nof the essence and results of his own artistic theories. There can be no\r\ndoubt that much of his work was the fruit of what were in his own mind\r\nvaguer inspirations, which he himself was unable to reduce to\r\ntheoretical formulæ. Therefore, while we may appeal to his prose\r\nwritings for evidence as to the sincerity and direction of his\r\nintentions, we may readily agree with the assertion of Mr. Hadow that\r\n“the arguments which have established the Wagnerian theory of opera are\r\nto be found not in ‘Opera and Drama,’ but in the pages of ‘Tristan’ and\r\n‘Parsifal.’”[8] It behooves us, therefore, to endeavor to trace the\r\ndevelopment of the Wagnerian theory in the mind of its inventor, and in\r\norder to do that we must follow the plan of Mr. Krehbiel,[9] and make\r\nsome inquiry into “the origin and nature of the lyric drama.”\r\n\r\nOf the origin of the drama it is not the province of this article to\r\nspeak, but we may note that the introduction of music into plays was a\r\nnatural movement. In Italy, where the opera was born, choruses had been\r\nsung in plays as far back as 1350, but up to 1597 the ecclesiastical\r\ncontrapuntal style prevailed, and in that year the speeches of a single\r\npersonage, in a comedy of Orazzi Beechi’s, were sung in five-part\r\nchoruses of sombre canonic form. The younger and more progressive minds\r\nin Florence began to perceive the unsuitability of this kind of music to\r\nthe drama. In their search after a new form they were guided by the\r\nrevival of interest in classic antiquity, known as the Renaissance; and\r\nthey set about reconstructing the musical declamation of the Greeks.\r\nTheir work began with the production of “monodies,” or what we should\r\ncall to-day dramatic scenes for one voice. Encouraged by their success\r\nin this direction, two of these enthusiasts, Ottavio Rinuccini, poet,\r\nand Jacopo Peri, musician, wrote a pastoral called “Daphne.” This had\r\nall the elements of modern opera, and its favorable reception at a\r\nprivate performance led the two men to try again. This time they wrote\r\n“Eurydice,” performed in public in 1600, and recognized as the first\r\nopera. The pregnant achievement of Peri in these works was the\r\nfoundation of dramatic recitation. It was nothing like the recitation of\r\nthe Greeks, but it was a new and noble art form, in which music strove\r\nto imitate the nuances of speech without ceasing to be music. “Soft and\r\ngentle speech he interpreted by half-spoken, half-sung tones [modern\r\n_parlando_], on a sustained instrumental bass; feelings of a deeper\r\nemotional kind, by a melody with greater intervals, and a lively tempo,\r\nthe accompanying instrumental harmonies changing more frequently.”[10]\r\nPeri’s theory, in short, was that recitative should copy speech, and\r\nthat his new art form, which was christened _drama per musica_, should\r\nfollow the Greek tragedies as its models. Claudio Monteverde advanced\r\nalong the path indicated by Peri, and furthermore began to make the\r\norchestra a potent factor in the musical exposition. But instrumental\r\nmusic now exercised a baneful effect on the opera, and in Cavalli’s\r\n“Giasone,” produced in 1649, we find the germs of the operatic aria,\r\nmodelled on the simple cyclical forms used by the fathers of the sonata.\r\nCavalli was opposed to recitative, and furthered the cause of simple\r\nrhythmical tune in opera. This new style was easy of comprehension and\r\npopular. Alessandro Scarlatti took it up and developed the aria so that\r\nit became the central sun of the operatic system. The result was\r\ninevitable. The person who could most beautifully sing an aria captured\r\nthe public heart; the singer became the dominating power in opera, and\r\nthe composer was relegated to a secondary place. From that time onward,\r\nthe history of the artistic development of opera is a series of contests\r\nbetween the singer and the composer, with the supremacy mostly on the\r\nside of the former. The result of this was the imposition upon the opera\r\nof a number of meaningless, artificial forms, in which a musical purpose\r\nwas manifest, but a dramatic design wholly undiscernible. In Handel’s\r\ntime this artificiality had reached an absurd stage. The different kinds\r\nof arias were labelled with extreme minuteness in the matter of\r\ndistinctions, and the composer was required to produce just so many in\r\neach opera and in each act. No vocalist might have two consecutive\r\narias, nor might two arias of the same kind be sung in succession. But\r\nin the second and third act the hero and the heroine each had a claim to\r\none grand scena followed by an _aria di bravura_, the latter being\r\ndesigned simply to display agility in ornamental passages. These laws\r\nwere afterwards modified, but down to the time of Wagner’s supremacy an\r\nopera librettist was expected to construct his book so that arias,\r\nduets, trios, quartets, and ensemble numbers should be found at places\r\nsuitable to the composer. In short, the nature and purpose of the opera\r\nhad been lost sight of; it was no longer _drama per musica_, but _drama\r\npro musica_,—a vastly different thing.\r\n\r\nThe first resolute opposition to this style of thing was made by Gluck,\r\nwho had the same high regard for the classics of antiquity as Peri and\r\nhis confreres had. Gluck’s theories and purposes are succinctly\r\nexpressed in his preface to “Alceste.” He says:—\r\n\r\n“I endeavored to reduce music to its proper function, that of seconding\r\npoetry by enforcing the expression of the sentiment and the interest of\r\nthe situations without interrupting the action or weakening it by\r\nsuperfluous ornament. My idea was that the relation of music to poetry\r\nwas much the same as that of harmonious coloring and well-disposed light\r\nand shade to an accurate drawing, which animates the figure without\r\naltering the outlines.... My idea was that the overture ought to\r\nindicate the subject and prepare the spectators for the character of the\r\npiece they are about to see; that the instruments ought to be introduced\r\nin proportion to the degree of interest and passion in the words; and\r\nthat it was necessary above all to avoid making too great a disparity\r\nbetween the recitative and the air of a dialogue, so as not to break the\r\nsense of a period or awkwardly interrupt the movement and animation of a\r\nscene. I also thought that my chief endeavor should be to attain a grand\r\nsimplicity; and consequently I have avoided making a parade of\r\ndifficulties at the cost of clearness.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph letter from Richard Wagner, written in Zurich,\r\n    May 30, 1853, addressed to some musical director, and advising him\r\n    to give “Tannhäuser” before producing “Lohengrin.”\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph musical manuscript written by Richard Wagner for\r\n    lithographic reproduction.

The\r\n    original is in the Bibliotheca Musica Regia in Dresden.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThese words make it plain that Gluck distinctly perceived the\r\nfundamental principle of artistic truth in opera,—that the music must be\r\nconsidered as a means and not an end. He felt that the music should be\r\ndevoted, not to the exploitation of musical possibilities, but to the\r\nfaithful expression of the emotions of the characters on the stage. His\r\nreforms met with determined opposition, and some of his contemporaries\r\ncomplained bitterly that they were compelled to pay two florins “to be\r\npassionately excited and thrilled instead of amused.” But while Gluck\r\nmade sweeping changes for the better, he failed to reach the root of all\r\nevil. He did not abolish from the operatic stage the set forms, which\r\nmade the musician the superior officer of the poet, commanding the\r\ninsertion of here a solo and there a duet. The continuance of these\r\nforms was conserved, too, by the splendid genius of Mozart, who breathed\r\ninto them a verisimilitude which they had not before possessed. The\r\nglorious boy had no reformer’s blood in his veins, but with the instinct\r\nof spontaneous mastership he made the spirit of his music vital, even\r\nthough its form was conventional. He founded no school, but he was an\r\nexcuse for the continuance of old traditions by others less gifted than\r\nhimself. So only twenty-six years after Gluck’s death all Europe went\r\nmad over “Ditanti palpiti,” and the name of Rossini became the watchword\r\nof the lyric stage. The opera was regarded as a parade ground for great\r\nsingers, and its music was expected to be cast in the simplest melodic\r\nmoulds, so that it could be hummed, strummed, whistled, or indifferently\r\nsung by the most poorly equipped amateurs. All conception of the opera\r\nas a drama employing music as a means of expression had been lost, and a\r\nman who asserted that its model had originally been and ought always to\r\nbe the Greek play would have been stared at as one unsound of mind. That\r\nthere were a few who were ready to raise from triviality so splendid an\r\nart form was proved by the gathering of warm and faithful adherents\r\naround the banner of reform raised by Wagner.\r\n\r\nLike most young artists he began his career by imitating the work of the\r\nacknowledged masters of his time. As we have already seen, he had no\r\nnovel ideas in the composition of “Die Feen.” He simply tried to imitate\r\nBeethoven, Weber, and Marschner. At this time the music of Beethoven was\r\nhis ideal. Heinrich Dorn has testified that no young musician could\r\npossibly have known the works of the immortal symphonist more\r\nthoroughly. But Wagner soon saw very clearly that it was not in his\r\npower to adopt the Beethovenian style to the lyric drama. For models for\r\nhis second work, therefore, he chose Auber and Bellini. The former’s\r\n“Massaniello” had opened his eyes to the value of action with brisk\r\nmusic to accompany it. The latter’s “Montecchi e Capuletti,” or rather\r\nSchroeder-Devrient’s inspiring performance of Romeo, had given him\r\nsuggestions as to the dramatic possibilities of vocal melody. In his\r\nsecond work, “Das Liebesverbot,” he tried to effect a combination of the\r\nstyles of these two masters. It must not be supposed that he was\r\nsearching merely for popular applause. He was intensely in earnest even\r\nat that stage of his career, and his aim was to produce real art. He did\r\nnot yet perceive the utter falsity of the prevailing system, though he\r\nwas honest in his endeavor to make it tell the truth. In his\r\nautobiographical sketch he records thus the ideas raised in his mind by\r\nthe Bellini performance:—\r\n\r\n“I grew doubtful as to the choice of the proper means to bring about a\r\ngreat success; far though I was from attaching to Bellini a signal\r\nmerit, yet the subject to which his music was set seemed to me to be\r\nmore propitious and better calculated to spread the warm glow of life\r\nthan the painstaking pedantry with which we Germans, as a rule, brought\r\nnaught but laborious make-believe to market. The flabby lack of\r\ncharacter of our modern Italians, equally with the frivolous levity of\r\nthe latest Frenchmen, appeared to me to challenge the earnest,\r\nconscientious German to master the happily chosen and happily exploited\r\nmeans of his rivals, in order then to outstrip them in the production of\r\ngenuine works of art.”\r\n\r\nArtistic sincerity of purpose, then, was already the man’s moving force.\r\nThe immediate impulse which led him to take the first step in the\r\ndevelopment of his own individuality was the conviction that the\r\nprovincial public of the smaller German cities was incapable of forming\r\na judgment as to the value of a new work. He, therefore, began “Rienzi”\r\nwith a determination to write an opera which could be produced only at a\r\ngrand opera house, and he decided not to trouble his mind as to what\r\ntheatre of that rank would give him an entrance. He says:—\r\n\r\n“I allowed naught to influence me except the single purpose to answer to\r\nmy subject. I set myself no model, but gave myself entirely to the\r\nfeeling which now consumed me, the feeling that I had already so far\r\nprogressed that I might claim something significant from the development\r\nof my artistic powers, and expect some not insignificant result. The\r\nvery notion of being consciously weak or trivial, even in a single bar,\r\nwas appalling to me.”\r\n\r\nWagner never wrote words fraught with greater significance. To sit down\r\nwith a determination to not be weak or trivial in a single bar, and to\r\nbe always faithful to his subject, and yet to construct his opera on the\r\nprevailing models, was for a man of Wagner’s intellectual power and\r\nartistic temperament to discover the radical defects of the opera of his\r\nday. He could not follow his models without being consciously weak or\r\ntrivial at times. An examination of the libretto of “Rienzi” shows that\r\nwhile there is carelessness in the poetry, the dramatic construction is\r\nexcellent. No better opera libretto dates from the time of its\r\nproduction. But it was constructed, as Wagner confessed, to enable him\r\n“to display the principal forms of grand opera, such as introductions,\r\nfinales, choruses, arias, duets, trios, etc., with all possible\r\nsplendor.” Consequently, while there is much in the music that is noble,\r\ndignified, and characteristic of Wagner, there is more that is weak,\r\ntrivial, and imitative. “Rienzi” is a very good opera of the old sort,\r\nand the dramatic force of its book, together with the excellence of much\r\nof its music, has kept it favorably before the public. But it lacks\r\nartistic coherency, because its fundamental principle is false; and\r\nWagner knew it before he had completed the work. The writer of this\r\narticle does not believe that this master, as some of his warmest\r\nadmirers have asserted, began “Rienzi” with a deliberate intention of\r\ncatering to a depraved public taste for the sake of success. Wagner\r\nearnestly craved success at that time; he needed money, and he yearned\r\nfor public recognition; but his own words show that he was deluded into\r\nsupposing that artistic work could be done on the lines of the popular\r\nopera of his day. It required the writing of “Rienzi” to bring to his\r\nmind the convictions, which were put to test in “The Flying Dutchman,”\r\nafter he had abandoned the hope of pecuniary success. This is not the\r\nplace for a discussion of the relative importance of objectivity and\r\nsubjectivity in art; but it is certain that “The Flying Dutchman” is the\r\nresult of an overwhelming desire for self-expression. Wagner at this\r\nperiod of his mental growth could have cried with Omar Khayyám:—\r\n\r\n            “I sent my soul through the Invisible,\r\n              Some letter of that after-life to spell;\r\n            And by and by my soul returned to me,\r\n              And answered, ‘I myself am heaven and hell.’”\r\n\r\nOvercome by his first real draught of the bitterness of life, he found\r\nthat his emotional moods were clamoring for expression. With the\r\nsplendid egotism of genius, he discerned the sorrow of a world in his\r\nown suffering. To dramatize this became his burning desire. The legend\r\nof the Ahasuerus of the sea, cursed by his own determination to overcome\r\nobstacles, opposed by all the powers of nature, seemed to Wagner the\r\nembodiment of his own experience; and he turned to the work of making an\r\nopera out of it, with no purpose except a complete and convincing\r\nexpression of the prevailing moods of his own soul. And it was thus that\r\nhe came upon the fundamental principles of the theory which set the\r\nmusical world agog and raised up lions in his path. The first conviction\r\nthat came to him was that of the superiority of a legendary over a\r\nhistorical story. He subsequently wrote of it thus:—\r\n\r\n“In this and all succeeding plans, I turned for the selection of my\r\nmaterial once for all from the domain of history to that of legend....\r\nAll the details necessary for the description and presentation of the\r\nconventionally historic, which a fixed and limited historical epoch\r\ndemands in order to make the action clearly intelligible,—and which are\r\ntherefore carried out so circumstantially by the historical novelists\r\nand dramatists of to-day,—could be here omitted. And by this means the\r\npoetry, and especially the music, were freed from the necessity of a\r\nmethod of treatment entirely foreign to them, and particularly\r\nimpossible as far as music was concerned. The legend, in whatever nation\r\nor age it may be placed, has the advantage that it comprehends only the\r\npurely _human_ portion of this age or nation, and presents this portion\r\nin a form peculiar to it, thoroughly concentrated, and therefore easily\r\nintelligible.... This legendary character gives a great advantage to the\r\npoetic arrangement of the subject for the reason already mentioned,\r\nthat, while the simple process of the action—easily comprehensible as\r\nfar as its outward relations are concerned—renders unnecessary any\r\npainstaking for the purpose of explanation of the course of the story,\r\nthe greatest possible portion of the poem can be devoted to the\r\nportrayal of the inner _motives_ of the action,—those inmost motives of\r\nthe soul, which, indeed, the action points out to us as necessary,\r\nthrough the fact that we ourselves feel in our hearts a sympathy with\r\nthem.”[11]\r\n\r\nThe second conviction that came to him was that of the folly of writing\r\nmusic at random, instead of clinging to the musical investiture of a\r\nmood once formed. This led him to the abandonment of the set forms of\r\nthe established opera, and to the adoption of his own plan of making the\r\nmusic and poetry an artistic unit. His words in regard to this matter\r\nare worth quoting:—\r\n\r\n“The plastic unity and simplicity of the mythical subjects allowed of\r\nthe concentration of the action on certain important and decisive\r\npoints, and thus enabled me to rest on fewer scenes with a perseverance\r\nsufficient to expound the motive to its ultimate dramatic consequences.\r\nThe nature of the subject, therefore, could not induce me, in sketching\r\nmy scenes, to consider in advance their adaptability to any particular\r\nmusical form, the kind of musical treatment being in each case\r\nnecessitated by these scenes themselves. It could, therefore, not enter\r\nmy mind to engraft on this my musical form, growing, as it did, out of\r\nthe nature of the scenes, the traditional forms of operatic music, which\r\ncould not but have marred and interrupted its organic development. I\r\ntherefore never thought of contemplating on principle and as a\r\ndeliberate reformer the destruction of the aria, duet, and other\r\noperatic forms; but the dropping of those forms followed consistently\r\nfrom the nature of my subjects.”[12]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD WAGNER.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph from life taken in Vienna about 1875 by Fr.\r\n    Luckhardt.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe found the germs of his future musical system in the ballad of Senta.\r\nIn this the legend of the unhappy Hollander is told, and in its musical\r\ninvestiture Wagner invented two melodic themes with distinct purposes.\r\nThe first was intended to illustrate the personality of the Dutchman as\r\nan embodiment of yearning for rest. The second was designed to represent\r\nthe redeeming principle, the _ewig weibliche_, the eternal womanhood,\r\nwhich became the ruling ethical feature of all Wagner’s lyric works.\r\nHere are the two themes:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\nThese two themes being designed to represent certain ideas, it was\r\ninevitable that the composer should use them whenever those ideas\r\nrecurred. As he tells us himself in the essay quoted above:—\r\n\r\n“I had merely to develop, according to their respective tendencies, the\r\nvarious thematic germs comprised in the ballad, to have, as a matter of\r\ncourse, the principal mental moods in definite thematic shapes before\r\nme. When a mental mood returned, its thematic expression also, as a\r\nmatter of course, was repeated, since it would have been arbitrary and\r\ncapricious to have sought another _motive_ so long as the object was an\r\nintelligible representation of the subject, and not a conglomeration of\r\noperatic pieces.”\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the origin of the three elementary principles out of\r\nwhich Wagner elaborated his system: First, the dramatic advantage of\r\nmythological or legendary subjects; second, the “intelligible\r\nrepresentation of the subject”; and third, the use of the representative\r\ntheme, “typical phrase” or _leit motif_. In “The Flying Dutchman” we\r\nfind his system in its embryonic state, but the perfected system, as\r\ndisplayed in “Tristan” and “The Ring,” is only a logical outcome of\r\nthese first thoughts, intensified, as it were, by his realization that\r\nthe whole thing was simply a modernization of the practice of the\r\ngreatest Greek dramatists. This realization caused him to question\r\nwhether, through the medium of an art founded on his theories, the\r\nmodern stage could not acquire a national importance and influence, such\r\nas the Greek theatre possessed. It will undoubtedly be easier for the\r\nreader now to take a comprehensive survey of the full-blown Wagnerian\r\nsystem than to try to follow its growth through the transitional stage\r\nof “Tannhäuser” and “Lohengrin.”\r\n\r\nWagner’s first law, as formulated succinctly by W. F. Apthorp in a\r\nmagazine article, is: “That the text—what in old-fashioned dialect was\r\ncalled the libretto—once written by the poet, all other persons who have\r\nto do with the work—composer, stage architect, scene painter, costumer,\r\nstage manager, conductor, and singing actors—should aim at one thing\r\nonly: the most exact, perfect, and lifelike embodiment of the poet’s\r\nthought.” So far as the composition of the music is concerned, this is\r\nprecisely what Peri and Gluck believed. But Peri had to invent dramatic\r\nrecitative; and standing, as it were, just on the hither side of chaos,\r\nhe could not be expected to produce at once a perfected art world. The\r\nmaterials of operatic art were in process of making; the first builder\r\nhad not the wherewith to rear a musical cathedral. Gluck erred in\r\npreserving the cut-and-dried operatic forms which made it impossible for\r\nhim to achieve his sincere design,—“to reduce music to its proper\r\nfunction, that of seconding poetry by enforcing the expression of the\r\nsentiment and the interest of the situations, without interrupting the\r\naction, or weakening it by superfluous ornament.” It was comparatively\r\neasy to get rid of the “superfluous ornament”; but the methodical\r\ndistribution of the old forms was found to interrupt the action. It\r\nremained for Wagner to see that these forms were unavailable for the\r\ncomposer who aimed at the complete embodiment of the poet’s thought; and\r\nit remained for him also to discern that the ideal lyric drama demanded\r\nan ideal harmony among its various elements. In other words, the\r\nperfected Wagnerian theory of the lyric drama contemplates the compact\r\nunion of poetry, music, painting, action, and all the other factors of\r\ndramatic illusion on a basis of common interdependence, so binding that\r\nit shall be impossible to say that one is more important than another,\r\nso perfect that no separation can be made without a loss of vital force.\r\n\r\nWagner discerned in the theatre the source of such art influence as\r\nreached the great mass of the people. Looking upon its managers and its\r\npublic as they actually appeared before his eyes, he saw the theatre in\r\nthe hands of those to whom art was nothing and gain everything, while\r\nthe public, jaded and sated, ceaselessly clamored for new sensations.\r\nContinued attempts of the money-seeking managers to satisfy this public\r\ndemand, which was in its very nature insatiable, had led to a condition\r\nof opera in which the music had no organic connection with the text, the\r\npageantry and ballets no logical relation to the pictorial ensemble.\r\nTurning his gaze backward to the home of true art, Greece, he saw a\r\ndrama in which poetry, action, and music were indissolubly united.\r\n\r\n“Thus,” he says, “we can by no means recognize in our theatrical art the\r\ngenuine drama; that one, indivisible, supreme creation of the mind of\r\nman. Our theatre merely offers the convenient _locale_ for the tempting\r\nexhibition of the heterogeneous wares of art manufacture. How incapable\r\nis our stage to gather up each branch of art in its highest and most\r\nperfect expression—the drama—it shows at once in its division into the\r\ntwo opposing classes, play and opera; whereby the idealizing influence\r\nof music is forbidden to the play, and the opera is forestalled of the\r\nliving heart and lofty purpose of actual drama. Thus on the one hand the\r\nspoken play can never, with but few exceptions, lift itself up to the\r\nideal flight of poetry; but, for very reason of the poverty of its means\r\nof utterance,—to say nothing of the demoralizing influence of our public\r\nlife,—must fall from height to depth, from the warm atmosphere of\r\npassion to the cold element of intrigue. On the other hand the opera\r\nbecomes a chaos of sensuous impressions jostling one another without\r\nrhyme or reason, from which each one may choose at will what pleases\r\nbest his fancy; here the alluring movements of a dancer, there the\r\n_bravura_ passage of a singer; here the dazzling effect of a triumph of\r\nthe scene painter, there the astounding efforts of a Vulcan of the\r\norchestra....”\r\n\r\n“The public art of the Greeks, which reached its zenith in their\r\ntragedy, was the expression of the deepest and the noblest principles of\r\nthe people’s consciousness; with _us_ the deepest and noblest principle\r\nof man’s consciousness is the direct opposite of this, namely, the\r\ndenunciation of our public art. To the Greeks the production of a\r\ntragedy was a religious festival, where the gods bestirred themselves\r\nupon the stage and bestowed on men their wisdom; _our_ evil conscience\r\nhas so lowered the theatre in public estimation that it is the duty of\r\nthe police to prevent the stage from meddling in the slightest with\r\nreligion; a circumstance as characteristic of our religion as of our\r\nart. Within the ample boundaries of the Grecian amphitheatre the whole\r\npopulace was wont to witness the performances: in our superior theatres\r\nloll only the affluent classes. The Greeks sought the instruments of\r\ntheir art in the products of the highest associate culture: we seek ours\r\nin the deepest social barbarism. The education of the Greek, from his\r\nearliest youth, made himself the subject of his own artistic treatment\r\nand artistic enjoyment in body as in spirit: our foolish education,\r\nfashioned for the most part to fit us merely for future industrial gain,\r\ngives us a ridiculous, and withal arrogant, satisfaction with our own\r\nunfitness for art, and forces us to seek the subjects of any kind of\r\nartistic amusement outside ourselves.”[13]\r\n\r\nMaking due allowance for the heated utterance of one to whom the\r\nquestions at issue had such grave personal importance as to prevent\r\njudicial calmness of speech, we cannot fail to perceive that Wagner had\r\npenetrated to the essence of the difference between the stage of Greece\r\nand that of Europe in his day. The compact union of the arts tributary\r\nto the stage had been at once the outcome and the embodiment of that\r\nintensely national art-feeling which he contrasted so bitterly with the\r\nmodern European lack of art-feeling, as he saw it. With the downfall of\r\nthe Athenian, state tragedy fell also, and “art became less and less the\r\nexpression of the public conscience.” In Wagner’s mind this downfall\r\nresembled that of the tower of Babel, with its subsequent dispersion of\r\nthe tribes. The dramatic union of arts was dismembered. Poetry,\r\npainting, music, rhetoric, all separated, and each went its own way in\r\npursuit of its own ends. No one who has reviewed the history of the fine\r\narts in the Middle Ages can fail to have observed how blindly they\r\nseemed to grope their way toward the gates of truth until the guiding\r\nlight of the Renaissance, with its new revelation of the classic\r\nantiquity, was turned upon Italy by the scholars driven out of\r\nConstantinople by the fall of Rome’s Eastern Empire. Wagner has reviewed\r\nthe dissevered condition of the arts and their employment as means, and\r\nnot ends, in a few terse sentences in the essay already quoted; and then\r\nhe says:—\r\n\r\n“Each one of these dissevered arts, nursed and luxuriously tended for\r\nthe entertainment of the rich, has filled the world to overflowing with\r\nits products; in each great minds have brought forth marvels; but the\r\none true art has not been born again, either in or since the\r\nRenaissance. The perfect art work, the great united utterance of a free\r\nand lovely public life, the _Drama_, _Tragedy_,—howsoever great the\r\npoets who have here and there indited tragedies,—is not yet born again;\r\nfor the reason that it cannot be reborn, but must be born anew.”[14]\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the herculean task which this self-appointed reformer of\r\nthe drama set before him; to demonstrate that the modern theatre had the\r\npower to bring itself into the same relation to the noblest ideal life\r\nof man as the Greek theatre had; and in order that this might be\r\nachieved it was necessary, in his opinion, to return to that union of\r\nthe arts, which has been mentioned so often. He believed that in his day\r\neach art had done all that it could do without the aid of the other.\r\nMusic unaided could go no further than it had in Beethoven’s symphonies.\r\nIndeed, even the mighty Ludwig had called in the help of poetry to\r\ncomplete his Ninth Symphony. Poetry could rise no higher than the wings\r\nof Shakespeare, Goethe, and Schiller had carried her. At this point,\r\nthen, must come that fusion of the arts, in which each would sacrifice\r\nsomething of its egotism for the sake of the splendid whole; and that\r\nwhole would be the art work of the future, the drama for the people. In\r\norder fairly to appreciate Wagner’s purposes we must pause here to\r\ninquire, what people? The answer to this question lies at the root of\r\nthe whole controversy which has arisen about Wagner’s works; or perhaps\r\nit would be more accurate to say that it is the neglect to make and\r\nproperly answer this inquiry which leads insufficiently informed persons\r\nto look upon Wagner as a rabid iconoclast. The people for whom he sought\r\nto rear anew the ideal drama was the German people. As Mr. Krehbiel has\r\nexpressed it: “Wagner believes that the elements of the lyric drama\r\nought to be adapted to the peculiarities, and to encourage the national\r\nfeeling of the people for whom it is created.... One of Wagner’s most\r\npersistent aims was to reanimate a national art spirit in Germany. The\r\nrest of the world he omitted from his consideration.”[15] This was an\r\ninevitable result of his conviction, acquired from study of the Greek\r\nstage, that the ideal drama should be national in spirit.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that, according to his ideas, the union of poetry,\r\npainting, music, and action in the “art work of the future” could be\r\neffected only by some sacrifice on the part of each art. Wagner plainly\r\nsaw, as we must see, that the special feature which must yield to the\r\nnecessary modification was _form_, or, more strictly speaking,\r\n_formality_. It was not form in the abstract that must be sacrificed,\r\nbut forms in the concrete,—forms which owed their preservation to\r\ntradition, and not to any intrinsic worth or imperative demand of art.\r\nTo preserve the old-fashioned operatic forms would have been to continue\r\nthe dominance of music in the drama; for the poet would still have been\r\na mere librettist, bound to provide for the aria, the duet, and the\r\nfinale. To introduce a distinctive kind of versification, such as the\r\nAlexandrine, or the Spencerian stanza, would have made poetry the\r\ncontrolling element. The first problem set before Wagner, then, was to\r\nfind subjects which would admit of the utmost freedom and\r\nunconventionality of treatment. Already in the embryonic state of his\r\ntheories, the myth had forced itself upon his mind as the necessary kind\r\nof subject; and in the final working out of those theories to their end,\r\nthe myth stood the test, with this important corollary, that it must be\r\na myth embodying one of the great elementary thoughts of mankind. Turn\r\nwhich way he would, he found support for his belief. Did the legendary\r\nbeings of the Greek stage lack the humanity and the ethical conditions\r\nnecessary for great tragedy? On the contrary, as Mr. Stedman has put\r\nit:—\r\n\r\n“The high gods of Æschylus and Sophocles for the most part sit above the\r\nthunder: but the human element pervades these dramas; the legendary\r\ndemigods, heroes, _gentes_, that serve as the personages,—Hermes,\r\nHerakles, the houses of Theseus, Atreus, Jason,—all are types of human\r\nkind, repeating the Hebraic argument of transmitted tendency, virtue and\r\ncrime, and the results of crime especially from generation to\r\ngeneration.”[16]\r\n\r\nAnd when Wagner turned from the Greek drama to the philosophy of his\r\nbeloved Schopenhauer, he found the same convictions forced upon him\r\nagain by his teacher’s art theory. This theory is propounded in Book\r\nIII. of “The World as Will and Representation.” The writer begs leave to\r\nquote a summary of it which he has made in a study of “Tristan”:—\r\n\r\n“Divested of its robes of metaphysical terminology, it is this: When the\r\nhuman mind rises from the study of the location, period, causes, and\r\ntendencies of things to the undivided examination of their essence, and\r\nwhen, further, this consideration takes place, not through the medium of\r\nabstract thought, but in calm contemplation of the immediately present\r\nnatural object, then the mind is brought face to face with eternal\r\nideas. Art, the work of genius, repeats these eternal ideas, which are\r\nthe essential and permanent things in the phenomena of the world. In\r\nother words, art endeavors to exhibit to us the eternal essence of\r\nthings by means of prototypes.”[17]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD WAGNER.\r\n\r\n  From a family group, photographed shortly before his death.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf course, Wagner could not find prototypes embodying “the eternal\r\nessence of things” in the small and shallow stories to which the\r\nlibrettists of the majority of the popular operas of his time had\r\nturned. He must seek for material which had its roots in the great heart\r\nof the people; which was not the fancy of a single mind, but the\r\nformulation of a people’s ideal. To the myth, then, he turned, impelled\r\nby his own reasoning, by the arguments of divine philosophy, as he read\r\nthem, and by the equally eloquent example of revered antiquity. And,\r\nindeed, we must all admit that the true myth is the individualization of\r\nan abstract ideal, and if we accept the Wagnerian theory, that abstract\r\nideal should be embodied in the personages of the drama, we must also\r\naccept the myth. Even if we refuse to believe that ideals, or even\r\ntypes, should be the actors in a drama, we shall probably have no\r\nhesitation in admitting that for _musical exposition_ only the broad,\r\nelementary emotions of humanity are well suited; and these are always\r\nfound most freely and powerfully displayed in the great world-thoughts\r\nof mythology. Thus Wagner’s Tristan and his Isolde are plainly intended\r\nto be embodiments of the elementary man and woman, standing in primeval\r\nbarbarian grandeur at gaze one upon the other, and overwhelmed by the\r\ntragic power of mastering passion. The history of the Tristan legend,\r\nwhich has found its way in different forms into the literature of\r\nseveral languages, is proof that the world has so regarded it. For six\r\nhundred years poets have accepted Tristan and Isolde as the most\r\nconvincing representatives of the mastery and the misery of love. In\r\nthis they stand sharply distinguished from the hero and heroine of\r\nWagner’s comedy, “Die Meistersinger.” Walther and Eva, moving in a story\r\nwhose design is to touch the manners of a time with the gentle reproof\r\nof satire, are not the embodiments of elementary thoughts, but are\r\ncircumscribed by the manifest environments of locality and period. But\r\nTristan and Siegfried are the unfettered, unconventioned man of all\r\ntimes and places; while Brünnhilde and Isolde are visible forms of the\r\nhighest of Wagner’s ideals, the eternal womanhood. It is a significant\r\nfact that this master, in the first works produced after he had\r\nabandoned the old style,—“The Flying Dutchman,” and “Tannhäuser,”—dealt\r\nwith these eternal types, while in “Lohengrin” he confined himself\r\nwithin comparatively narrower limits, returning to his first position\r\nwhen he had fully formulated the theories whose promptings rose within\r\nhim as only vague, artistic instincts in his early works. And having\r\ncleared his theories from all doubts in his own mind, he emphasized the\r\nhumanity of his mythical characters by some of his finest touches.\r\n\r\n“The northern Scalds created tremendous myths. The spirit of their poems\r\nwas colossal. Passions and sweetness stood side by side and were\r\ndelineated with master strokes. Lofty sentiment and heroic deed were\r\ndarkened by unspeakable crime and black tragedy. The German bards\r\ndenuded these old poems of their glory and made their personages small.\r\nThe heroes and heroines of the Sagas were enormous unrealities; those of\r\nthe Nibelungen Lied were almost pretentious nonentities. Wagner seized\r\nupon every trait of character and every incident that was most human and\r\nmade masterly use of it. It is the ease with which we recognize in the\r\npeople of ‘Der Ring des Nibelungen’ primeval human types that makes us\r\nreceptive of their influence and movable by their greatness.”[18]\r\n\r\nHaving found his people, the next object of the poet-composer was to\r\nselect a flexible and yielding form for their utterance. He must find a\r\nform of verse which could be organically united with music, which would\r\nsuggest a rhythmical basis for the melody, yet not control its\r\nconstruction. The various forms of modern versification, founded on the\r\nrhetorical accent of words, offered him no advantages, but, on the\r\ncontrary, placed difficulties in the path of his movement. Rhyme, for\r\ninstance, has no value whatever for the composer, unless he constructs\r\nthe phrases and sections of his melody with the same number of feet and\r\nthe same metrical pauses as are found in the verse; and this method, of\r\ncourse, gives the mere formalism of the poetry the government of the\r\nprocess of composition. On the other hand, blank verse is bound to find\r\nthe same treatment in music as prose does. Wagner, therefore, turned to\r\nthe metrical basis of all Teutonic poetry, namely, the alliterative\r\nline, as it is found in the “Eddas.” The peculiarity of this line is the\r\nemphasizing of its rhythm by the employment of similar sounds at the\r\nbeginning of the accented syllables. A fair specimen of it is the\r\nopening of Siegmund’s love song in “Die Walküre”:—\r\n\r\n                          “Winterstürme wichen\r\n                          Dem Wonnemond;\r\n                          In milden Lichte\r\n                          Leuchtet der Lenz;\r\n                          Auf linden Lüften,\r\n                          Leicht und lieblich,\r\n                          Wunder webend\r\n                          Er sich wiegt.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD WAGNER AT BAYREUTH.—By G. Papperitz.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA clause such as “Winterstürme wichen dem Wonnemond” readily suggests to\r\nthe ear the position of musical accents which will be identical with\r\nthose of the verse, but which leave the composer wholly free in his\r\nmelodic treatment of _lines_. A single glance will demonstrate to the\r\nreader that the above words can be placed in lines three or four times\r\nas long without making the slightest change in the rhythmical effect\r\nproduced by the alliteration.\r\n\r\nWe now come to Wagner’s musical method, the nature of which has already\r\nbeen briefly indicated in the account of the birth in his mind of his\r\nnew ideas. In his search after a modern substitute for the sustained\r\nintonation of the Greek drama, he had before him for study the dramatic\r\nrecitative of Peri and the dramatic _arioso_ style of Gluck. The former\r\nwas wholly unavailable. Years of use had fastened upon it a collection\r\nof traditional phrases, familiar to the ear of every one who goes often\r\nto hear opera or oratorio. These traditional phrases, hopelessly\r\ninflexible, made dramatic recitative a thing of conventionalities, and\r\nunconventionality was the only hope for Wagner’s system. The Gluck\r\n_arioso_ style was equally unsuited to his purpose, because, as we have\r\nbeen obliged to note before, it preserved the formalities of the\r\nold-fashioned opera,—those very formalities which Wagner felt that he\r\nmust abandon if he would secure his compact union of the arts tributary\r\nto the stage. He needed a style of composition which would permit the\r\nmusic to flow freely from the words and which would impose no obligation\r\non the composer to repeat certain words or lines in order that certain\r\npassages of music might be rounded out to a pretty close as in the\r\nold-fashioned aria. He was in search of lyric expressiveness freed from\r\nlyric conventionality. He therefore decided that each act of any one of\r\nhis music-dramas must consist of one unbroken stream of melody. In other\r\nwords, as long as there were persons or scenes before the audience,\r\nthere must be a musical exposition of their moods, and that exposition\r\nmust be unbroken and apparently unartificial in form, just as a train of\r\nmoods is.\r\n\r\nBut to make the actors sing without cessation would fatigue both them\r\nand the audience; and, moreover, it would be untrue to nature, since men\r\nand women do not frame every thought and emotion in words. Hence Wagner\r\nconceived the idea of allotting the voicing of the ceaseless melody to\r\nthe orchestra, while the personages of the drama should utter their\r\nwords in a form of lyric recitative based on the broader principles of\r\nPeri, as expressed in his preface to “Eurydice,” but freed from acquired\r\nconventions and modified according to the promptings of Wagner’s own\r\nmusical genius. Naturally, then, the question arose in the composer’s\r\nmind, “What form is my melody to have?” For he knew as well as Schumann\r\ndid that music demands first of all things form. Now, the basis of\r\nmusical form is the repetition of melodic phrases. There is no form, and\r\ntherefore no coherence, no sense, in music consisting of disjointed\r\nphrases, each of which is heard once and never again. Yet to repeat them\r\nin any of the old-fashioned ways would have been to load himself down\r\nwith some one of the set forms which he was trying to escape.\r\nConsequently this formidable problem was before him: How was he to make\r\nhis endless melody intelligible to the auditor, to give it a palpable\r\nsignificance, to convey through it to the hearer the emotional moods of\r\nhis personages, and yet impose upon it musical form, based upon\r\nrepetition, but free from the artificiality of the older formulas? He\r\nfound the solution in the suggestion which had come to him when he\r\ninvented the two principal themes of Senta’s ballad in “The Flying\r\nDutchman.” The solution of the problem was the perfection of this system\r\nof representative themes, each designed to stand for a particular\r\nperson, thought, mood, or action, and to be repeated by the orchestra or\r\nvocalist whenever its subject had significance, though not necessarily\r\npresence, in the scene before the audience.\r\n\r\nHow are these representative themes obtained? Does Wagner construct a\r\nmelody arbitrarily according to his fancy, and label it the “Siegfried”\r\nmotive, the “Brünnhilde” motive? A moment’s reflection will suffice to\r\nconvince the reader that such a system would be worse than puerile. It\r\nwould not be in any sense as good as the method of Donizetti, who could\r\nat least give a pathetic color to the aria of his moribund tenor.\r\nWagner’s high purpose was to make an indissoluble organic union between\r\nthe poem and the music, and this purpose forbade all arbitrary or\r\nhaphazard procedure in the construction of a _leit motif_. Music has a\r\ncertain power of emotional expression; therefore Wagner’s endeavor was\r\nto invent themes representative of characteristic traits or emotional\r\ntendencies of his personages. In some cases when he required a musical\r\nrepresentation of an inanimate object, he invented a theme which would\r\nsuggest the object by suggesting emotions associated with it. Another\r\nclass of themes is descriptive of externals, and belongs to what has\r\nbeen well called scenic music. The last class is the smallest, for, as a\r\nrule, Wagner’s scenic music serves its purpose but once. When it is\r\nintended for only one hearing, it is simply descriptive music, freely\r\ncomposed. When intended for more than one hearing, it has a deeper\r\nsignificance. Let us make a closer examination of the master’s processes\r\nin the construction of these leading motives, and that we may be\r\nlogical, let us begin with the lowest order, the scenic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD WAGNER, IN 1877.\r\n\r\n  After a portrait by Herkomer, etched by himself.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe central and the most picturesque character of “The Rheingold” is\r\nLoge, the god of fire. In this prologue of the tetralogy he appears as\r\nthe evil counsellor of Wotan, and while his character is indicated in\r\nmany striking ways, his entrance is heralded by a purely scenic bit of\r\nmusic known as the magic fire music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\nThis music is intended solely to represent the flickering, ascending\r\nfire. It reappears with most picturesque effect at the close of “Die\r\nWalküre,” when Wotan, having put Brünnhilde to sleep upon her rock,\r\nsummons the fire from the earth to keep her couch inaccessible to all\r\nsave the yet unborn hero who shall know no fear.[19] Examples of the\r\nfree descriptive or scenic music, composed without leading motives, may\r\nbe found in “Tristan” (the sailors’ music, and the shepherd’s piping),\r\nin “Siegfried” (the familiar “Waldweben”), and in “Parsifal” (the dance\r\nof the flower maidens). Of the class of music a step higher in respect\r\nof significance,—that in which an inanimate object is represented by an\r\nappeal to the emotions associated with it,—the most brilliant example is\r\nthe sword motive. The sword of Siegmund, which is to be welded anew by\r\nSiegfried and used by him in wresting the Rhine treasure from the grasp\r\nof the giant Fafner, is one of the most potent agents in the advancement\r\nof the action of the tetralogy. It is always indicated musically by this\r\nbold, martial theme, whose brilliant challenge rings with the pride of\r\ncombat:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\nIt is a notable evidence of the depth of Wagner’s artistic purpose that\r\nhe first uses this motive in “Das Rheingold,” before the sword has been\r\nfashioned, when only the idea of creating the race of Siegmund has\r\ndawned in Wotan’s mind. Another motive of this kind is that which\r\nrepresents the tarn helm, the magic cap whose possessor can make himself\r\ninvisible or change his appearance. The motive is so uncertain in its\r\ntonality—a quality obtained by the use of the empty fifth—that it\r\nadequately depicts the mysterious nature of the tarn helm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\nBut the most beautiful and significant development of this remarkable\r\nmusical system is to be found in the construction of those motives which\r\nare designed to illustrate the emotions and dramatic principles of the\r\nplays. Of these there are some which have also a scenic aspect and at\r\nfirst will seem to the new hearer of Wagner’s works to belong wholly to\r\nthe external class. The most easily comprehended is that commonly\r\ndescribed as the smithy motive. The Nibelungs were dwarfs, dwellers in\r\nthe hollows of the earth, and workers in precious metals. They were a\r\ncrushed, tyrannized race, and after one of their number, Alberich, had\r\nobtained power over the worldly possession of a ring of Rhine gold, they\r\nbecame the most abject of slaves. Two things appeal to us in the\r\ncontemplation of this race: first, ceaseless labor at the smithy;\r\nsecond, the bitterness of spirit caused by the drudgery. Wagner invented\r\nfor the theme representative of this race the smithy motive, founded on\r\na rhythm imitative of the beating of hammers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A HUMOROUS COMPOSITION ADDRESSED TO LOUIS KRAFT.\r\n\r\n  The host of Hotel de Prusse, in Leipsic.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\nIt seems at first as if this theme could picture for us only that\r\nbeating. But in the second act Alberich’s brother, Mime, who has been\r\nplotting to get the Rhine treasure for himself, is slain by Siegfried.\r\nThen Alberich, who is concealed in the forest and witnesses the scene,\r\nlaughs aloud in bitter scorn of his fallen foe; and his laugh consists\r\nof that Nibelung theme sung fortissimo. Then we perceive that the theme\r\nfully embodies both of the characteristics of the dwarfs, of which the\r\nsecond is the product of the first. To rise a step higher, in the first\r\nact of “Die Walküre,” when Siegmund and Sieglinde, the only living\r\nmembers of the race of Volsungs, are gazing into one another’s eyes and\r\nlearning to sympathize with one another’s sorrows, the orchestra, always\r\nrevealing to us the most secret feelings of the actors, plays this\r\npassage:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\nThe bass phrase is the motive of the Volsung race, and its melancholy\r\ncharacter is intended to remind us that this is a race of tragic heroes\r\nwhose heritage is woe. The treble phrase is the motive of sympathy. It\r\nis, therefore, written in thirds, the closest and most elementary of\r\nthose harmonic agreements called consonances, and it is, in melody as\r\nwell as harmony, expressive of sympathy. In the second act of the drama\r\nof “Siegfried,” when the young hero lies under the tree in the forest\r\nand wonders what manner of being his mother was, the orchestra reminds\r\nus that he is a Volsung by intoning the motive in this form:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\nAnd again when Siegfried in “Die Götterdämmerung” has sobbed forth his\r\nlast words and lies dead among Gunther’s appalled vassals, the basses of\r\nthe orchestra once more wail out this sad motive, accentuated by\r\nmuttered beats of the kettle drums. Thus we see that this motive is\r\nalways heard when the two thoughts—Volsung race and its woe—are\r\nespecially significant in the drama. We learn that it refers to these\r\ntwo things by the text with which it is associated, and we then find\r\nthat it intensifies for us the feeling of that text.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  UNFINISHED BUST OF RICHARD WAGNER.\r\n\r\n  Last work of Lorenz Gedon, in possession of Friedrich Schön, of Worms.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe association with the text is, of course, the key-note of Wagner’s\r\n_leit motif_ system. There can be no successful refutation of the\r\nassertion that a few of the leading themes of the Bayreuth music-dramas\r\nare arbitrary in their formation. There are themes which are intended to\r\nrepresent purely intellectual processes, and this is something that\r\nmusic cannot do. But we need never be at a loss as to Wagner’s intent.\r\nNo lecturer nor handbook is necessary as a guide through the music of\r\nthese works when the hearer has once grasped the idea that every _leit\r\nmotif_ is associated with the words or the acts which explain its\r\ndesign, and this, too, almost invariably on its first appearance. All\r\nthat the hearer needs to know is the text. It was not a part of Wagner’s\r\ntheory that his listeners should commit to memory a string of titles of\r\nmotives, such as the “Love Renunciation Motive,” the “Hero Idea,” the\r\n“Love Thrills,” the “Decree of Fate.” Many of these titles have been\r\ninvented by the handbook makers, who, in their eagerness to explain\r\nWagner to the world, have done much to persuade the world that he is\r\nincomprehensible. The student of Wagner needs no translation of the\r\nmusic, except the text. Wagner did not believe, as many have asserted,\r\nthat music was capable of definite expression as words are. On the\r\ncontrary, in his prose works, he again and again declared that music was\r\nincapable of telling a story, that it demanded the assistance of text,\r\nand that the two must be joined in such close wedlock that they would\r\noperate upon the mind and emotions of the hearer as a single indivisible\r\nforce. Therefore the student of these works needs only to make himself\r\nmaster of the poems, and then to note carefully the music that\r\naccompanies every sentiment or deed. In the Nibelung tetralogy, the\r\nmusic of “Rheingold” is the foundation of all that follows, and it must\r\nbe known first. As each new motive appears in that work, it is\r\nexplained. Two or three illustrations will suffice. In the first scene,\r\nthe three Rhine-maidens sing this:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Rhinegold, Rhinegold, lustrous delight,\r\n  Thou laughest in radiance rare.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen Siegfried, having slain the dragon, comes out of the cave, that\r\nmusic is heard in the orchestra. Does any one need a handbook to tell\r\nhim that it refers to the hero’s being now the master of the Rhine gold?\r\nAgain, after telling Alberich that he who can make a ring out of the\r\nRhine gold will have unlimited power, one of the girls sings this:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  But he who passion’s power forswears,\r\n  And from delights of love forbears,\r\n  But he the magic commandeth the prize to mould to a ring.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere the text fully identifies the music as the motive of renunciation,\r\nand as such we recognize this melody when Wotan in the last scene of\r\n“Die Walküre” parts from his best beloved daughter, Brünnhilde. This\r\nfirst identification of a theme enables the composer to attain some of\r\nhis finest effects, for he makes some motives have an air of prophecy.\r\nFor instance, two motives are especially connected with Siegfried, and\r\none of them refers to his being a great hero. This motive is first heard\r\nin the last scene of “Die Walküre” before Siegfried is born, and before\r\nBrünnhilde knows that he is to be her lover. Yet it is Brünnhilde who\r\nvoices it in foretelling his birth to Sieglinde:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The highest hero of worlds hid’st thou,\r\n  O wife, in sheltering shrine.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThenceforward we know that melody to be the theme of Siegfried, the\r\nhero. Immediately following this is introduced a theme which appears\r\nagain in the full voicing of the orchestra after Brünnhilde has restored\r\nthe Rhine gold to its rightful owners and immolated herself on\r\nSiegfried’s funeral pyre at the end of the last drama of the series. If\r\nwe wonder at its meaning there, we refer to its first appearance in “Die\r\nWalküre,” and find that Sieglinde utters it as a proclamation of the\r\ndivine womanhood of Brünnhilde:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Oh, marvelous sayings,\r\n  Maiden divine.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother example will show how a representative theme may be modified,\r\naccording to the development of the person whom it represents, without\r\nlosing its identity. The theme which has special reference to\r\nSiegfried’s buoyancy of spirit, the producer of youthful enthusiasm, is\r\nintoned by the hero on his horn thus:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\nIn “Die Götterdämmerung,” when Siegfried has become a fully developed\r\nman, this melody is modified so as to signify his mature heroism. It is\r\nthen proclaimed by the orchestra thus:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\nAs the writer has had occasion to say elsewhere, “The alteration to\r\nwhich the music is subjected is one of rhythm. The _motif_ changes from\r\nsix-eight to common rhythm. The effect produced is one of those which\r\nare founded upon the nature of music. A six-eight rhythm is light and\r\ntripping; a four-beat rhythm is firm and solid.” This alteration of the\r\nrepresentative theme, then, “develops the character of the melody along\r\nthe same lines as Siegfried’s character has developed,—from lightness\r\nand ebulliency to firmness and solidity.” These examples should be\r\nsufficient to give the reader a tolerable comprehension of the manner in\r\nwhich Wagner worked out his new operatic form. It seems necessary now\r\nonly to lay special stress upon the suggestion already offered, that the\r\nlistener at the performance of a Wagner music-drama does not treat\r\neither himself or the composer fairly when he busies his mind wholly\r\nwith the identification of the themes as they present themselves\r\nsuccessively to his hearing. The proper effort is to get at the organic\r\nconnection between action or thought and the music, to read each by the\r\nlight of the other, and to see whether it is not possible to penetrate\r\nby means of the two into the spirit of the drama. If the hearer\r\naccomplishes this, he will have at least the right to say that he has\r\napproached the consideration of this art work of Wagner’s in a spirit of\r\nfairness; and though he may not know the title of a single theme, he\r\nwill have a far better understanding of their meaning than they who have\r\ncommitted to memory some one of the thematic handbooks.\r\n\r\nThis exposition of Wagner’s theories will have failed to achieve its\r\npurpose if the reader does not now clearly perceive that its fundamental\r\npostulate is that the opera is a _drama_ in which music is merely the\r\nchief vehicle of expression. This ruling idea led Wagner not only to\r\nabandon the old formulæ, but to do many things which would, perhaps, be\r\ninexpedient to attempt in absolute music. The great Bayreuth master has\r\nbeen severely censured, by those who cling to the belief that music\r\nshould always be pretty, for having written many harsh progressions and\r\nfor having indulged in remarkable boldness in his harmonies. These\r\nso-called sins of the master must find their justification in the fact\r\nthat he was not aiming at purely musical beauty. The whole purpose of\r\nhis work was “exact and lifelike embodiment of the poet’s thought.” When\r\nthe emotion of an actor was harsh, the music had to be harsh. When the\r\nemotions were grand and beautiful, the music had to be of a similar\r\ncharacter. It is for these reasons that we find the snarling anger of\r\nAlberich and Mime, the bitter hatred of Ortrud, the fury of Isolde,\r\nvoiced in music which is not pretty, but which is truthful. But on the\r\nother hand, when Wagner has to express the sorrows of the Volsungs, the\r\nfierce and sudden passion of Siegmund and Sieglinde, the awful revulsion\r\nof feeling in the death of Siegfried, or the highest elevation of\r\nwoman’s love in the last moments of Isolde, he rises to a sublime height\r\nof melody, an overwhelming dignity of harmony, and an irresistible\r\neloquence of instrumentation not equalled by any other composer. As\r\nLouis Ehlert, not a Wagnerite, has well said: “Wagner’s music always\r\nimpresses us with the idea that we are in the presence of genius. It may\r\nat times be ugly, obtrusive, and noisy; but it is never silly and\r\ninsignificant.”[20]\r\n\r\nMuch of the pungency of Wagner’s music, which makes it disagreeable to\r\ntimid ears, is due to his progressiveness in the matter of harmony. He\r\nhas gone to the furthest limit in the use of passing notes, as primarily\r\nembodied in the polyphony of Bach. He has followed the rule thus\r\nformulated by Dr. Parry:—\r\n\r\n“Suspensions are now taken in any form and position which can in the\r\nfirst place be possibly prepared even by passing notes, or in the second\r\nplace be possibly resolved even by causing a fresh discord, so long as\r\nthe ultimate resolution into concord is feasible in an intelligible\r\nmanner.”[21]\r\n\r\nMany of Wagner’s harmonic progressions belong to that class which\r\ninstruct rather than obey the theorists. These progressions have all\r\nbeen found capable of justification by analysis, and will therefore\r\nremain as part of Wagner’s contributions to the development of musical\r\nscience and art. In considering these novelties, we must remember that\r\ngenius is usually in advance of its day, and what sounded strange at\r\nfirst by reason of its novelty will in good time become part of the\r\ncommon diction of the art. In instrumentation, Wagner also made many\r\ninnovations, and it is indisputable that he was the greatest master of\r\nthe art of scoring who has ever lived. He showed a profounder insight\r\ninto the individual capacity of every instrument than any composer\r\nexcept Berlioz, and in fecundity of combination he excelled even the\r\ngifted Frenchman. He enriched the body of tone of the modern orchestra\r\nby the employment of the tenor tuba, and emphasized the value of the\r\nneglected bass trumpet. His addition to the customary number of horn\r\nparts splendidly improved the mellow tone and solidity of the brass\r\nchoir, and his use of the bass clarinet, not simply as a solo\r\ninstrument, but as a re-enforcement of the organ-like bass of the\r\nwoodwind department, was a stroke of genius. He further developed the\r\nexpressiveness of the woodwind band by the novelty of his distribution\r\nof harmony among its members. Not only did he allot solos to them with\r\nunerring judgment, but departing from the conventional style of the\r\nclassic symphonists, who used their wood instruments in pairs playing in\r\nthirds and sixths, he wrote for these instruments in a marvellously\r\neffective dispersed harmony. In writing for the strings, Wagner divided\r\nthem more frequently than his predecessors had done, often making six or\r\neight real parts among the violins alone. Altogether his instrumentation\r\nis richer in its polyphony and more solid in its body of tone than that\r\nof any other composer. He has been accused of being noisy, but power of\r\nsound is not necessarily noise. There is more noise in some of Verdi’s\r\nshrieking piccolo passages, accentuated with bass-drum thumps, than in\r\nthe loudest passage that Wagner ever wrote.\r\n\r\nTaking him by and large, as the sailors say, Wagner is the most striking\r\nfigure in the history of music. Whether the future will or will not\r\naccord to him the position granted by the musical world of the\r\npresent—that of the greatest genius (though not the profoundest\r\nmusician) the art has produced—he will remain fixed upon the records as\r\nthe most commanding intellect that ever sought to express its thought\r\nand accomplish its purposes though the medium of music. His influence\r\nupon his contemporaries has been larger than that of any other master\r\nsince the science of modern music began. One has only to study the\r\nlatest operas of that real genius, Verdi, to perceive how one of the\r\nmost gifted musical minds of our time was forced to yield to the\r\nconvincing truth of Wagner’s ideas. As for those of less original force\r\nthan Verdi, they have one and all—even Mascagni, who is as purely\r\nItalian as Wagner was purely Teutonic—been swayed by his irresistible\r\ninfluence. Even the symphonic writers have been guided by him, and no\r\nman can ever again write an orchestral score as if Wagner had not lived.\r\nThe futile controversy about his theories and his style will probably be\r\nkept alive for some years by those who persistently refuse to remodel\r\ntheir inflexible conceptions of what ought to be after the splendid\r\npattern of what is. But Wagner’s theories will live, for he was the\r\nfulfillment of the prophetic words of Herder on Gluck: “The progress of\r\nthe century led us to a man, who, despising the frippery of wordless\r\ntones, perceived the necessity of an intimate connection of human\r\nfeeling and of the myth itself with his tones. From that imperial height\r\non which the ordinary musician boasts that poetry serves his art he\r\nstepped down and made his tones only serve the words of feeling, the\r\naction itself. He has emulators, and perhaps some one will soon outstrip\r\nhim in zeal, overthrowing the whole shop of slashed and mangled\r\nopera-jingle, and erecting an Odeon, a consistently lyric edifice, in\r\nwhich poetry, music, action, and decoration unite in one.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: N.

These precious heirlooms have been\r\ncherished and preserved, and their peculiar earnestness, purity of\r\nstyle, and depth of sentiment have rendered them sources of lofty\r\ninspirations to the great masters who have achieved for Germany her\r\nworld-wide fame in music. It is unfortunate that our knowledge of German\r\npopular music in the Middle Ages is not as full and trustworthy as that\r\nconcerning the beginnings of contrapuntal art in the Netherlands,[22]\r\nand the development of Catholic Church music. We have the best\r\ninferential evidence that the sense of melody and rhythm existed in\r\ndefinite form among the people earlier than in church music. This\r\nevidence comes to us from an observation of the devices to which the\r\nmonks of St. Gallen resorted, in order to popularize the Gregorian song\r\nin Germany. For, whereas the plain chant of Gregory seems never to have\r\nbeen musically enjoyable to the Germans, certain _sequentiæ_ introduced\r\nby these monks, notably by Notker, surnamed the Stammerer († 912),\r\nbecame universally popular among the people. These “sequences” should\r\nnot be confounded with the so-called sequences defined in our modern\r\ntreatises on harmony. A sequentia was a hymn, with words in rhymed Latin\r\nset to fitting music. Such sequentiæ were sung by trained choirs at\r\ncertain moments in the service, and the congregation joined in the\r\nphrases like “Kyrie” and “Alleluia” which followed. “Veni Sancte\r\nSpiritus,” “Stabat Mater,” and “Dies Iræ” are sequences of this sort.\r\nThese sequences are really concessions to the popular taste of the time.\r\nThe mass of the people loved melody and rhythm, characteristics which\r\nwere ultimately recognized as necessary to church music.\r\n\r\nThe folk-songs of Germany are quite unlike the Minnelieder (love-songs).\r\nThis is evident both in the words and melodies. The folk-song is more\r\nnaïve, tender and rhythmical than the heavy and solemn Minnelied. In\r\nmost cases the latter resembles the choral in having slow and equal\r\nnotes. Comparatively few of the old folk-songs have come down to us\r\nunchanged, and of still fewer do we know the date of composition.\r\nProbably we owe many of them to travelling minstrels, who went about\r\nfrom place to place.\r\n\r\nDuring the sway of the Troubadours, the love of poetry and song spread\r\nover Europe, and Germany was directly influenced by them. The\r\nMinnesingers were a similar class of knightly lyrists. Their favorite\r\nmeeting-place was the Wartburg, near Eisenach, at the Court of Hermann,\r\nLandgrave of Thuringia. Among the most celebrated of these poet-singers\r\nwere Wolfram von Eschenbach, Walther von der Vogelweide, Heinrich\r\nSchreiber and Heinrich von Zwetschin. The influence of the Minnesingers\r\nwas greatest in the thirteenth century, and rapidly died out in the\r\nfollowing. They were succeeded by the Mastersingers who were of the\r\nburgher class, and included in their ranks schoolmasters, clerks and\r\nmechanics. The foremost Mastersinger was Hans Sachs, the famous\r\npoet-cobbler, who lived in Nuremberg in the sixteenth century. The music\r\nof the Mastersingers was in general heavy and expressionless, very much\r\nlike church psalmody.\r\n\r\nWagner has immortalized both classes of mediæval singers in his\r\n“Tannhäuser” and “Mastersingers,” but the true source of his inspiration\r\nwas not their music, but the poetic and dramatic characteristics of the\r\npicturesque life of those days.\r\n\r\nThe folk-songs were more rhythmical and melodious than either the\r\nMinnesongs or Mastersongs. It is certain that as an element of influence\r\nin the practice and development of music in the latter part of the\r\nMiddle Ages and at the time of the Reformation, popular music in Germany\r\nhad risen to an eminence hardly second to the Gregorian song.\r\n\r\nSome of the music of the Minnesingers was a direct outgrowth from the\r\nfolk-songs. Their poems were composed principally to interest those who\r\nlived at court, but the music, so far as it had melodic character, was\r\nimitated and developed from the melodies of the people. A rude and\r\nsimple instrumental accompaniment was characteristic of these\r\nproductions. The element of declamation, too, must have been very\r\nimportant, for even up to the thirteenth century the “singing” and the\r\n“saying” of poetry were identical in meaning.\r\n\r\nThe folk-songs had great influence, as we have seen, on the melodic\r\ninvention of composers of the Reformation. Other influences were potent,\r\nhowever, in determining the various forms of composition. The\r\ndevelopment of counterpoint in the Netherlands, and the higher _a\r\ncapella_ church style in Italy, were important for Germany. Attempts\r\nwere made to treat secular melodies in the elaborate style of the\r\nNetherlanders, with the melody in the tenor, accompanied by several\r\ncontrapuntal parts.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Isaak, who was a member of the choir of the Emperor Maximilian\r\nfrom 1493 to 1519, enjoyed Italian training, and wrote sacred and\r\nsecular music in the prevailing Flemish style. He won for himself the\r\ntitle of the “German Orpheus.” His contemporary, Heinrich Finck, was\r\nlikewise famous and beloved. Also Stephan Mahu, a singer in the choir of\r\nFerdinand I., was of the same school, and wrote motets and\r\n“lamentations” in a simple but sublime style. The earliest Protestant\r\nmusic was in the style of these masters, and the choral with\r\ncontrapuntal accompaniment was suggested by their treatment of sacred\r\nchants and secular melodies. Under the influence of the Reformation,\r\nsacred music was cultivated with renewed fervor.\r\n\r\nMartin Luther, the head and front of the great movement, took a profound\r\ninterest in music, which he exemplified by his noble “Ein’ feste Burg,”\r\nand other melodies and hymns. Associated with him were the musicians\r\nJohann Walther and Louis Senfl. Their labors did not extend beyond the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century, and may be said to mark the first\r\nperiod of Protestant Church music. Walther was court musician at Torgau\r\nwhen called by Luther to Wittenberg to collaborate with the singer,\r\nConrad Rupff, concerning the arrangement of the German mass. Walther’s\r\nchoral book was the first one published. It appeared at Wittenberg in\r\n1524, under the supervision of Luther, who wrote a preface to the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LUDWIG SENFL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe most able musical character of the period was Ludwig Senfl. He was\r\nborn and educated in Switzerland, and was a pupil of Heinrich Isaak. He\r\nbecame a member of the choir of Emperor Maximilian, and in 1530 was\r\nchosen director of church music at the Bavarian court in Munich, a\r\nposition afterward held by Orlando Lasso.\r\n\r\nSenfl was not only a composer of motets and other church music, but\r\nalso, according to the custom of his day, set to music many ancient\r\nodes, particularly those of Horace. A collection of these odes was\r\npublished in 1534 at Nuremberg. Senfl did not compose original chorals,\r\nbut in his contrapuntal treatment of them displayed a higher degree of\r\nskill and taste than his contemporaries, and he was clearly the\r\nforerunner of masters like Eccard and Michael Prætorius. A pure,\r\nreligious spirit animates his works, and the chaste style of his themes\r\nand counterpoint renders his music interesting. Among other masters of\r\nthis period who were influenced by the Flemish school may be mentioned\r\nHeinrich Finck, Rahw, Resinarius, Agricola, Duces, Dietrich and Stolzer.\r\nFinck is especially noted for his motet-like arrangements of chorals;\r\nand Rahw published in 1544 a collection of chorals to which the\r\nabove-named composers and others contributed.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, this activity in Protestant music was not without\r\nparallel in Catholic music. Indeed, the works of these same composers\r\nwere sung in the Catholic cathedrals of their native land. Heinrich\r\nIsaak, who has already been mentioned, was the only noteworthy composer\r\nof this time who devoted himself exclusively to Catholic Church music.\r\nHis work, in common with that of a multitude of lesser masters, was\r\nsurpassed infinitely by the achievements of Orlando Lasso. This great\r\nmusician, although a Belgian by birth, spent much of his life in\r\nGermany, and from his prominent position at Munich wielded a powerful\r\ninfluence on the musical life of his age.\r\n\r\nThe second period in the development of Protestant Church music may be\r\nsaid to have begun about the middle of the sixteenth century, when it\r\nbecame the fixed custom to place the melody in the highest part of the\r\nharmony. When given to the tenor, the melody could never assert its\r\nrights, for it was often lost in the polyphonic complexity of the other\r\nvoices. Its transference to the soprano—a reform suggested by the _stile\r\nfamiliare_ of Josquin de Près and by the Italian _frottole_ and\r\n_villanelle_—had been determined by the Calvinist psalm collections of\r\n1542 and later. This new style of composition was assiduously cultivated\r\nduring the latter half of the century, and its ablest representatives\r\nwere Hassler, Eccard and Michael Prætorius.\r\n\r\nHans Leo Hassler was born at Nuremberg in 1564, and died in 1612. He was\r\neducated in music by Andreas Gabrieli at Venice. He was one of the first\r\norganists of his time, and a clever contrapuntist and composer. Although\r\na disciple of the Venetian school, his compositions have a genuine\r\nGerman simplicity and strength; but the most justly celebrated German\r\ncomposer of the century was Johannes Eccard, who was born at Mülhausen\r\nin 1553. It was conjectured that he was a pupil of Lasso. Eccard’s music\r\nis simple compared with that of his contemporaries of the Venetian and\r\nRoman schools. He was content to use his gifts in a less pretentious\r\nway, but nevertheless his Festival Songs deserve a place among the best\r\nchurch music. They are a perfect embodiment of religious devotion, and\r\nshow a complete mastery of the peculiar form which he adopted in his\r\nmusic. In his works the melody appears in the soprano, but is not\r\nsufficiently individualized to be separated from the harmony. The parts\r\nare generally five in number, they move freely, and are well adapted to\r\nthe voices of the singers. Eccard was likewise the composer of sacred\r\nsongs, which are noble in comparison with similar music of his day; but\r\nhis attention was devoted chiefly to church music. Two of his pupils\r\nbecame celebrated musicians, Johann Stobäus and Heinrich Albert. The\r\nlatter had an important influence on the early development of the German\r\nLied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HANS LEO HASSLER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TITLE-PAGE OF “SYNTAGMA MUSICUM.”\r\n\r\n  (See page 573.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent masters of the early part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury was Michael Prætorius (1571–1621). He witnessed the great change\r\nwhich was then taking place in music, but contributed nothing to it\r\nhimself. He endeavored, however, to educate his countrymen to appreciate\r\nthe new style of secular music which, in Italy, was then making rapid\r\nheadway in the operas of Peri, Caccini and others. For a number of years\r\nhe was organist and director of music at Brunswick, where he died. In\r\nhis great admiration and study of the new Italian masters, he did not,\r\nlike his eminent successor, Heinrich Schütz, lose his nationality. The\r\nnumber of works he composed, collected, and elaborated is two thousand.\r\n\r\nHis most important contribution to music, however, is his “Syntagma\r\nMusicum,” a theoretical work of great value to students of musical\r\nhistory. Concerning instruments and the theory of music, it is a rich\r\nsource of knowledge.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeenth century the opera was invented and ardently\r\ncultivated in Italy. With the adoption of the new lyric style of\r\nrecitative and aria, much greater scope was possible for artistic\r\ninstrumental music than ever before. The violas and other bowed\r\ninstruments were brought into prominence, and in the course of the\r\nseventeenth century formed the basis of the orchestra. Yet, during the\r\nlatter half of the sixteenth century considerable use was made of\r\ninstrumental accompaniment in church music. In the choir, directed by\r\nOrlando Lasso, in Munich, from 1569 till 1595 there were twelve bass\r\nsingers, fifteen tenors, thirteen altos, twenty sopranos, and thirty\r\ninstrumentalists. The Dresden band had ninety-three wind and percussion\r\ninstruments, and only thirteen stringed instruments. The curious\r\ncharacter of some of these combinations is indicated in the clearest\r\npossible way on the title-page of Prætorius’ “Syntagma Musicum.” Here we\r\nsee three separate choruses, each accompanied by a separate organ. In\r\nthe first of these (at the left of the illustration) the voices are\r\nsupported by stringed instruments, in the second (at the right), by reed\r\ninstruments, and in the third, by trombones and bassoon.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with the development of orchestral accompaniment, the\r\nseventeenth century witnessed a wonderful development of organ and\r\nclavier playing. In this also Italy took the lead. The first great\r\nartists in organ playing were Italians; the most prominent of whom were\r\nClaudio Merulo and Giovanni Gabrieli, appointed organists at St. Mark’s\r\nin Venice in 1551 and 1557. A noted disciple of this Venetian organ\r\nschool was the Netherlander, Jan Pieters Sweelinck, who studied under\r\nZarlino and Cyprian de Rore. Later he was the teacher of various German\r\norganists, among whom was Samuel Scheidt (1587–1654). The “father of\r\ntrue organ playing,” Girolamo Frescobaldi (1587–1640), organist of St.\r\nPeter’s in Rome, wielded even greater influence on Germany through his\r\nfamous pupils, Caspar Kerl and Jacob Froberger. Various forms of\r\ncomposition, whose names suggest their Italian origin, became common in\r\nGermany at this time; such as the capriccio, the canzona, the toccata\r\nand the ricercata. In all these forms fugal imitation is predominant,\r\nand the modern fugue begins to take determined shape. Pachelbel\r\n(1653–1706), a pupil of Kerl, was the first to combine the various\r\nadvantages of both the German and Italian schools, and his works also\r\nmark the establishment of the modern tonal system. He made important\r\nadvances in fugal art. We of to-day recognize the wonderful artistic\r\nconsistency of Bach’s master-works in the fugue form. We note that they\r\nare composed of various sections which include separate developments of\r\na principal theme, and that these sections are connected by episodical\r\npassages of a character similar to that of the rest of the composition.\r\nBut we are apt to lose sight of the fact that this perfection of form\r\nwas of very gradual growth. Pachelbel was the first to feel the\r\nnecessity of attaining such artistic unity by careful attention to these\r\ndetails of construction. His successful endeavors to individualize and\r\nto group his ideas give a hitherto unknown clearness of form to his\r\norgan fantasias and toccatas. In his fantasias especially he employs\r\nrich figurations, but always with the evident purpose of making such\r\nornamentation naturally grow out of the thematic material of the work,\r\nand all is carefully designed with reference to the nature of the\r\ninstrument. His contemporary, Johann Adam Reinken, who died in 1732, at\r\nthe age of ninety-nine, was, as composer and player, a veritable\r\nvirtuoso. Sebastian Bach made two journeys to Hamburg for the purpose of\r\nhearing this master play. But, among all the predecessors of Bach in\r\nthis branch, the most prominent was Dietrich Buxtehude, organist at\r\nLübeck from 1669 to 1707. In all respects he elevated the art of organ\r\ncomposition and organ playing. The structure of his themes shows the\r\ngreatest appreciation of the peculiar character of the instrument. Two\r\nyears before Buxtehude’s death Bach became his pupil, and the influence\r\nof Buxtehude[23] is seen in the earlier organ compositions of Bach.\r\n\r\nClavier, or clavichord, composition was of later growth. At first,\r\nindeed, the same principles were applied to both instruments. The\r\nearlier English and Italian clavier masters used the various forms of\r\norgan composition with little regard for the different construction of\r\nthe instruments. But as time went on the less ponderous of the two\r\ninstruments became the exponent of the gayer moods, as represented by\r\nvarious forms of the dance. Under French masters, especially, the\r\nclavier began to have a style of its own. The clavier suite, or\r\n_partita_, was the favorite form, and consisted of a succession of dance\r\nmovements. The name sonata, now of such definite meaning in connection\r\nwith chamber music, was at first represented by short Venetian organ\r\npieces. Subsequently, in the seventeenth century, the sonata was a\r\ncomposition for one or more violins with clavier. This originated in\r\nItaly under Corelli and others, and was imitated in England by Purcell,\r\nand in Germany by Biber and others. The first application of the name\r\nsonata to a solo for clavier was made by Johann Kuhnau, Bach’s\r\npredecessor as cantor of the St. Thomas School at Leipzig. His “Fresh\r\nClavier Fruits; or, Seven Sonatas of good Invention and adapted to the\r\nClavier,” shows by its title that this branch of composition was\r\nreceiving some attention at a time which has been wholly eclipsed by the\r\nsplendor of the succeeding period.\r\n\r\nFrom this rapid sketch of the progress of organ and clavier music during\r\nthis period, which produced but few works that have survived, we see how\r\nsteady was the development of the art which became grand and ultimate in\r\nthe works of Sebastian Bach, and how intimate was this master’s\r\nconnection with the musical activity of his time. A similar review of\r\nthe course of the opera and the oratorio will enable us to trace the\r\ngrowth of certain other art forms which took definite shape before the\r\ndawn of Germany’s musical greatness.\r\n\r\nWe have already spoken of the important influence exerted by the\r\nfolk-song on the German church music of the sixteenth century. Hassler\r\nwas the first to attain a blending of the folk-song style with that of\r\nolder counterpoint. He was aided in his striving by a study of the\r\nItalian madrigals and villanelle. His dance-songs are especially rich in\r\nmelodic feeling, and show that in the art of melodic phrasing he\r\nfollowed closely in the footsteps of the Italians. With the development\r\nof the instrumental accompaniment early in the seventeenth century there\r\ncame certain changes of style. The ever-increasing tendency of the time\r\nto allow the melody to stand forth more prominently began to modify the\r\nnature of the harmonic setting. The songs of Jeep (1582–1650), and of\r\nhis rival, Valentin Hausmann, show degeneracy, while the songs of Adam\r\nKrieger (1634–66) and Johann Krieger (1652–1736) are noble examples of\r\nthe new style. The melodies of Johann Krieger are particularly charming,\r\nand show strong rhythmical character and real artistic power. He employs\r\nsimple harmonies, yet shows more freedom and naturalness in modulation\r\nthan any of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nWe perceive in the music of these German masters the universal sway\r\nwhich Italian opera already began to exercise. The opera—as the special\r\narticle on Italian music fully describes—had its beginning in Italy just\r\nat the dawn of the seventeenth century. “Mysteries” and “liturgical\r\ndramas”—both of them crude stage representations of episodes in biblical\r\nhistory—had been common in Germany long before this time; and the church\r\nmusicians—Isaak, Senfl, Walther, Lasso and others—had worked to some\r\nextent in this field. But it was not until the great Monteverde\r\n(1568–1643) had embodied in his operatic works the results obtained by\r\nthe Bardi society of connoisseurs, and not until Carissimi had done\r\nsimilar service for the oratorio, that the new principles began to take\r\nroot and develop in Germany. Johann Kapsberger, a composer, who resided\r\nat Rome from 1610 to 1630, was the first German to adopt, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, the new ideas concerning vocal composition. But\r\nthere soon arose in Germany a number of composers who cultivated the new\r\nstyle, especially the oratorio, without losing their German\r\ncharacteristics. Johann Gottlieb Staden (1581–1636), for instance, was a\r\nNuremberg composer of operettas. He had for his motto in art, “Italians\r\nknow not all, for Germans, too, have thoughts.” The works of Staden show\r\nthat the Germans from the outset had a tendency to characterize the\r\npersonages of the drama by the accompanying music. Unfortunately the\r\nmusic of the first serious opera, “Dafne,” by Heinrich Schütz, the words\r\nof which were translated from the text of Rinuccini, has been lost.\r\nAlthough a considerable amount of creative energy was bestowed on\r\n“Singspiele” and operas, especially by amateurs, it was not until\r\ntheatres were established in Germany that the opera enjoyed a\r\ncultivation equal to that of the oratorio and church music.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of a permanent theatre was first made at Hamburg in 1678.\r\nThe determined zeal of Gerhard Schott, an influential jurist of that\r\ncity, made the attempt successful, and as long as he lived the opera did\r\nnot lack encouragement. This period embraces over sixty years. The first\r\nperformance at this theatre was a musical play by Johann Theile\r\n(1646–1724), who had been under the instruction of Schütz in Weissenfels\r\nand a former choir-master in Gottorp. This sacred, allegorical work was\r\nsucceeded by a number of similar pieces by the same composer. Other\r\nsuccessful masters of the same period were Franck, Strungk, the\r\ncelebrated violinist; also Förtsche, Conradi and Kusser. The\r\nlast-mentioned composer was appointed conductor in 1693, and was a\r\nworthy forerunner of Keiser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HEINRICH SCHÜTZ\r\n]\r\n\r\nReinhard Keiser was twenty-one years old when, in 1694, he was appointed\r\ndirector of the Hamburg opera. He was a man of undoubted genius. His\r\nproductivity as a composer was immense. His works number about one\r\nhundred and twenty operas, many of which contain, in addition to\r\nchoruses, recitatives, etc., no less than forty airs. In all his serious\r\noperas there was no spoken dialogue. His works were very popular\r\nthroughout Germany. His activity was not confined to the stage, for he\r\ncomposed church music, passion music and cantatas. He had a rare and\r\nseemingly inexhaustible gift of melody, and his recitatives are\r\nmasterly, but his music lacks the breadth and massive strength of his\r\nsuccessor, Handel. “All that Keiser wrote,” says Mattheson, “was\r\nuncommonly easy to sing, and was so easily caught by the ear that one\r\nenjoys it without feeling any respect or intense admiration for it.”\r\nKeiser lacked earnestness, and did not exert an enduring influence for\r\ngood on the Hamburg opera. He was willing to lend his art to the most\r\ntrivial and nonsensical farce, in order to afford amusement to the rough\r\nand common people. Mattheson compares him with his more earnest\r\ncontemporary, Rosenmüller, whose sonatas were “like the fresh blue\r\nsalmon of the Elbe,” while Keiser’s light music was “like the smoked\r\ngolden herrings of the North Sea, which tickle the palate, but awake a\r\nthirst for drink.” In place of the sacred spectacles and plays which at\r\nthe outset had formed the subject of the drama on the Hamburg stage, in\r\nthe course of time the gods and heroes of mythology, and vulgar farces,\r\nbegan to divide the attention of the public. The stage spectacle grew\r\nmore and more sensational. Fireworks, devils, serpents, dragons, battle\r\nscenes and all kinds of noises and sights were introduced. Not content\r\nwith mere humanity on the stage, various animals became personages in\r\nthe drama, and mingled their outcries with the music of the orchestra.\r\nThen again, in some operas, no less than four different languages were\r\nspoken and sung indiscriminately; yet in spite of all these absurdities,\r\nthe Hamburg opera remained worthy of the services of a Handel or a\r\nMattheson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIRST SCENE IN KEISER’S OPERA OF “HANNIBAL.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nJohn Mattheson was a Hamburger by birth, and began his musical career as\r\na singer at the opera. He made his last appearance in that capacity in\r\nHandel’s “Nero” in 1705. Mattheson was a man of remarkable versatility\r\nof talent. He was a very prolific composer, but did not possess great\r\noriginality nor depth of conception. He was a good actor, singer, and a\r\nfinished performer on the harpsichord. As a literary musician he still\r\nholds an eminent place. He used his facile pen in the composition of an\r\nopera, or passion, or in the preparation of a musical essay; also in the\r\ntranslation of some such pamphlet as that on “The Properties and Virtues\r\nof Noble Tobacco.” His music, which once found so many enthusiastic\r\nadmirers, is no longer performed, but his writings are still of value to\r\nstudents of musical literature. His most famous books are “The Complete\r\nArt of Conducting,” “The Newly Opened Orchestra,” and the “Triumphal\r\nArch.” The last is especially valuable as a source of information\r\nconcerning the lives of musical artists. These works have a place in\r\nevery complete musical library.\r\n\r\nA more gifted musician was Georg Philipp Telemann, who was born four\r\nyears earlier than Handel and Bach. Telemann was the last famous\r\ncomposer for the Hamburg theatre. His works are more distinctly German\r\nthan the majority of those of the period, which was thoroughly under the\r\ninfluence of Italy in all matters pertaining to opera Telemann’s name\r\nmarks the decline of the Hamburg stage. The time was not yet ripe for a\r\ndistinctively national style of opera. It was destined for Gluck and\r\nMozart, half a century later, to reform and develop German opera.\r\n\r\nIt has already been said that the oratorio enjoyed at first a steadier\r\nand more constant development in Germany than the opera. Heinrich\r\nSchütz, whom we have mentioned as the author of the first opera given in\r\nGermany, was also the first prominent oratorio composer. He was born in\r\n1585. By frequent visits to Venice, where he studied with Gabrieli, he\r\nkept himself in touch with the musical life of Italy. Although Dresden\r\nwas the scene of his principal labors, the last twenty-five years of his\r\nlife were spent in Weissenfels, where he died in 1672. His larger works\r\nare “The Passion” according to the four Evangelists, the “Story of the\r\nResurrection,” and the “Seven Last Words.” In the second of these works,\r\nproduced in Dresden in 1623, the form of the modern oratorio is clearly\r\ndefined. The customary “Introitus” is for six-part chorus, and the words\r\nof the Evangelist are intoned. The more significant passages of the text\r\nare selected for characteristic music. The _dramatis personæ_—the\r\nSaviour, the Angel, Mary Magdelene, and some of the disciples—are given\r\nprominence and individuality in various _cantilene_ movements, sometimes\r\nfor one or two voices. This distinguishes the new form of oratorio from\r\nthe older, in which everything was performed by choral masses. In\r\nSchütz’s sacred symphonies and concertos he attained far greater finish\r\nand variety in the solo numbers, and greater mastery in general. By his\r\nattempts to tell the story in dramatic form, without the aid of scenery\r\nor action, Schütz became the real founder of the modern German oratorio.\r\nWe cannot suppose, however, that Handel was acquainted with the music of\r\nSchütz, for before the end of the seventeenth century his works were\r\ngenerally forgotten; but his greater freedom of treatment, and dramatic\r\ninterest, established ideals in Germany which prevented the oratorio\r\nfrom yielding in that country to the degenerating theatrical influence\r\nwhich had such baneful effect on all forms of sacred music in Italy at\r\nthis period.\r\n\r\nContemporary with Schütz was J. H. Schein, who was noted for his sacred\r\nconcertos. Johannes Rosenmüller, who died in 1680, effected a more\r\nregular construction of the concerto. His works in this form consist of\r\na series of separate movements, which show unity of character by the\r\nrepeated presence of some principal thought. Thus the form of the\r\ncantata was established, in which Bach afterwards displayed such\r\nwonderful activity. The immediate predecessors of Bach were Johann\r\nRudolph Ahle (1625–73), and his son Georg Ahle (1650–1706). In the\r\noratorios of the latter the form of the aria is clearly defined.\r\n\r\nThe account that has been given of the development of Protestant Church\r\nmusic, and organ and clavier music, previous to Handel and Bach, may\r\nserve to show the foundations on which their monumental works were\r\nbuilt. It was Handel’s mission to reconcile the church and secular\r\nstyles in his great oratorios. His long career as a dramatic composer\r\nserved as an admirable school for his talents; and when in middle life\r\nhe abandoned the field of Italian opera for the oratorio, he was so well\r\nequipped that his triumphs were but as the natural result of his former\r\ndiscipline. His forty operas shared the fate of all operas of that time;\r\nnot one holds a place on the modern stage. The operas of Handel are not\r\nmusical dramas in the sense of the present day. They consist chiefly of\r\na string of airs, with little or no dramatic action. His stage heroes\r\nare generally trivial and insipid. It was destined for Gluck and Mozart\r\nto reform the traditional Italian opera. Handel was content to avail\r\nhimself of the conditions of the opera as they then existed. His opera\r\nairs are the best of his time; they are lyric, but not dramatic.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic talent of Handel did not find expression in his operas but\r\nin his oratorios. The great heroes of Jewish history, like Samson, Saul\r\nand Judas Maccabæus, are represented in a combined narrative and\r\ndramatic form. Many of his oratorio solos are more dramatic than his\r\nopera airs.\r\n\r\nIn the oratorio of “Samson,” for instance, the characters of Samson,\r\nDelila, Minoah and Micah naturally suggest the dramatic scene. But it is\r\nespecially in the conflicting ideas and emotions of the people—the\r\nchorus of Israelites, in opposition to the chorus of Philistines, the\r\nheathen priests of Dagon, and the chorus of Virgins of Delila—that the\r\ndramatic conflict is sharply defined with sublime choral effects. His\r\nchoruses are elemental in their irresistible and overwhelming power when\r\nsung by large masses of voices. In this respect his choruses are unique\r\nand have never been equalled. While Handel’s oratorios in general hold\r\nthe middle ground between the secular and church style of his time,\r\nBach’s great choral works belong more distinctly to the older church\r\nstyle of Schütz and others.\r\n\r\nAs Palestrina marks the culmination of the unaccompanied (_a capella_)\r\nchurch music of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, so Bach is the\r\nhighest representative of Protestant Church music. Yet he is more than\r\nthis, for in his sacred cantatas and passions he reveals a nature more\r\nprofoundly religious than even Handel or Palestrina. His Passion music\r\nto St. Matthew has no rival in its special form. It is the sublimest\r\nconception in music of the trials and death of Jesus. Among similar\r\nworks before and during Bach’s time, his passions are the only ones that\r\nhave lived. The oratorio has replaced the passion; but the older form as\r\nperfected by Bach possesses a certain reality and intensity of religious\r\nfervor that not even the grandest oratorios of Handel can match, except\r\npossibly the “Messiah.” Notwithstanding the sublimity, variety and vocal\r\neffectiveness of the latter work, the St. Matthew Passion surpasses it\r\nin lyric pathos and dramatic fire. Handel’s long experience with the\r\npublic, his Italian vocal training, the example of Purcell and other\r\nmasters of the English anthem, were important factors in his artistic\r\ndevelopment, and enabled him to carry the art of solo and chorus\r\ncomposition to the highest perfection. On the other hand, Bach’s\r\ndifficult choral style suggests the organ, and his airs, though full of\r\nreligious pathos, are often stiff and archaic in style.\r\n\r\nGreat as Bach is in his vocal works, he is still greater in his\r\ninstrumental music. Through him, for the first time in history,\r\ninstrumental music reaches a point of influence where it predominates.\r\nHe is justly considered as the true progenitor of modern instrumental\r\nmusic, and largely to his influence we owe the subsequent wonderful\r\ndevelopment of this youngest branch of art. Handel, on the other hand,\r\nhad little influence on instrumental music. His counterpoint is more\r\nvocal than instrumental; he makes a more limited use of dissonances and\r\nmodulation. Bach stood far in advance of his time in these respects, and\r\nanticipated many of the effects of the present day. His remarkable use\r\nof chromatic and enharmonic modulation is exhibited in all his principal\r\nworks, especially in such movements as the great organ Fantasia in G\r\nminor. (Volume II., Peters’ Edition.)\r\n\r\nAs a master of the fugue, nay, of all polyphonic writing, Bach stands\r\npre-eminent, a model for all time. We are overcome by the inexhaustible\r\nwealth of his ideas, that seem as boundless as the forces of nature, and\r\nwe constantly feel the emotional depth and romantic sentiment of this\r\nwonderful artist.\r\n\r\nHe not only perfected the stricter forms of counterpoint, but the older,\r\nlighter forms found their ideal in his charming clavier suites, violin\r\nsonatas, etc. His “Well-Tempered Clavichord” is a unique work, one of\r\nthe corner-stones of modern music.\r\n\r\nAbove all, his organ works are the very central point and acme of his\r\nachievement. The great Prelude and Fugue in A minor, the Fantasia and\r\nFugue in G minor, the Toccata in F, the Passacaglia, and other organ\r\ncompositions are to be classed with Beethoven’s symphonies as among the\r\ngreatest works of art.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the attempt to establish German opera at Hamburg,\r\nItalian opera held full sway in Germany until the influence of Gluck and\r\nMozart was felt.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the great achievements of Sebastian Bach were almost\r\nentirely unrecognized and unappreciated by his countrymen, his\r\ncontemporaries, Hasse and Graun, were lauded to the skies, and the\r\noperas of the Neapolitan school, with their singer-triumphs, held all\r\nEurope in subjection.\r\n\r\nThe Italians Steffani, Cimarosa, and Jomelli lived in Germany, and their\r\nworks were often given in the principal opera houses. It was then only\r\nnatural that Germans should seek public favor by adopting the prevailing\r\nmusical style. Chief among the writers in the Italian style were Johann\r\nAdolf Hasse (1699–1783), Karl Heinrich Graun, and Johann Gottlieb\r\nNaumann. The number of Hasse’s compositions is extremely great. They\r\ninclude operas, oratorios, masses, cantatas, and instrumental movements\r\nof every kind. The florid style of Italian vocal composition\r\npredominated in his music. The harmonic structure is of the simplest\r\nnature, and his instrumentation is without individuality. He had better\r\ntaste than most Italians of his time, and showed greater dramatic\r\ninstinct. On the whole it may be said that he represents the highest\r\nattainment of the Italian opera of the school of Scarlatti. The music of\r\nGraun, who was born in 1701, is not so purely Italian in style, and\r\ncertain of his sacred works, notably his passion music, entitled “Tod\r\nJesu” (Death of Jesus), are known at the present time. His recitatives,\r\nlike those of Hasse, are dry and insignificant. On the contrary, his\r\narias are more pleasing, and show the influence of Keiser. The songs of\r\nGraun deserve mention. The compositions of Naumann (1741–1801) display\r\nperfect facility in the Italian style; his career, however, was\r\ninterrupted by the appearance of Gluck and Mozart in the operatic field.\r\n\r\nGluck had a long experience as a dramatic composer before he entered on\r\nthe path which has rendered his name illustrious in the annals of music.\r\nHe was already advanced in years when he turned his back on the Italian\r\nopera, and disclosed his plan of reform. His principles applied only in\r\ntheir full force to the degenerate _opera seria_ of that period. These\r\nideas were by no means original with him; they had previously been\r\naccepted, and realized by other musicians. They were, however, first\r\nbrought into the foreground by the production of his “Alcestis,”\r\n“Orpheus,” “Iphigenia,” and other mature works, and divided the musical\r\nworld of that time into opposite parties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  R. Bong. X.A.\r\n\r\n  KARL HEINRICH GRAUN.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that Gluck, who fought against the musical\r\ninconsistencies and defects of his time, should not have felt the\r\nnecessity of reforming the dramatic construction of the opera, for he\r\nshowed a much keener insight and appreciation of dramatic effect than\r\nthe poets whose librettos he composed. He knew how to give\r\ncharacteristic expression to the personalities of the play. His\r\ncharacters may be read like an open book. In simplicity and dignity of\r\nstyle he approached the Greek ideal.\r\n\r\nWhile Gluck increased the significance of accompanied recitative and\r\ninsisted on truer methods of declamation, he would not allow the air the\r\nsame prominence that the Italians did. His airs are divested of all\r\nrichness of ornament and colorature. Many of them are noble in their\r\nsimplicity, but in general they lack sensuous charm and beauty. The\r\nchorus was a very important feature of his operas, and fulfilled\r\nsomething like its original object in ancient tragedy. In his dramatic\r\nuse of the orchestra, Gluck stood in advance of his time. He added new\r\ninstruments, and produced original and impressive effects which render\r\nhis orchestration interesting to musicians of the present day.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the nobility and grandeur of his conceptions, he neither\r\nfulfilled the ideal of the musical drama from the point of view of\r\nWagner, nor of the opera as perfected by Mozart. The latter embodied\r\nGluck’s ideas in works which surpass his in every respect except\r\ndramatic simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe field of music in which Mozart stands pre-eminent is the opera. He\r\nwas endowed by nature and favored by opportunity to bring this form to\r\nideal perfection, at least as regards the musical element of the opera\r\nof his time. He learned first of the Italians and then of Gluck, and\r\nsurpassed the highest accomplishments of both. “Don Giovanni” and\r\n“Figaro” are the greatest of Italian operas. No one has ever united more\r\nperfectly than Mozart precision and energy of dramatic expression with\r\nthe richest and purest melody. His dramatic characters are thoroughly\r\nindividualized by the music. Each one appears on the stage to remain\r\ntrue and consistent to his or her individuality in every phase of\r\npassion and conflict of action. This power of contrasting characters is\r\nespecially vivid in his concerted music, in the inimitable quartets and\r\nsextets of his latest operas. For this purpose, Mozart exercised his\r\nperfect command of vocal composition and polyphony.\r\n\r\nBefore his time the orchestra, as a means of dramatic expression and\r\ncoloring, was not appreciated, although Gluck pointed out the way. Under\r\nMozart it became more symphonic and massive in character. The solo\r\ninstruments became refined organs of feeling, giving color and sensuous\r\nbeauty to the vocal parts. The orchestration intensified the dramatic\r\nfire of the scene from beginning to end. In his operas every feeling of\r\nthe heart finds utterance. A divine harmony and classic purity of form\r\ndistinguish his dramatic music, as, indeed, all his music, from the\r\nlittle minuets which he composed as a child to his last operas and\r\nsymphonies. During the time of Gluck and Mozart the German operetta came\r\ninto existence. Mozart’s “Entführung” (Belmont and Constanza) is the\r\nnoblest example of this style. This new form of musical drama was\r\nsuggested by the French comic opera. It adopted the spoken dialogue for\r\nthe less dramatic moments of the play. It resembled, however, the French\r\noperetta only externally, and soon developed a genuine German character.\r\nThis new species of musical play sought to do that which the brilliant\r\nand conventional Italian opera could not accomplish, namely, interest\r\nthe great masses of the people. This was at first possible only through\r\ninartistic exaggeration of the realities of life, and by the\r\nintroduction of humorous elements of a distinctly coarse kind. But the\r\ngeneral demand for musical plays of this class gradually attracted to\r\ntheir composition writers of real musical and dramatic ability.\r\n\r\nJohann Adam Hiller (1728–1804) was the first German who became prominent\r\nas a composer of operettas. “Lottchen at Court,” “Rustic Affection,” and\r\n“The Hunt” are his principal operettas. The last named was given not\r\nless than forty times during a short theatre season in Berlin in 1771.\r\nEven before this time the operetta had become so generally popular that\r\na writer had had occasion to remark that tragedies and legitimate\r\ncomedies were being driven to the wall. Yet there was one serious\r\nobstacle to the operetta’s rapid artistic development. The good singers\r\nwere monopolized by theatres giving Italian opera, and operetta managers\r\nhad to take what was left.\r\n\r\nVienna soon began to acquire the prominence in operetta performances for\r\nwhich it is distinguished at the present day. In 1778, the erection by\r\nJoseph II. of the “Deutsches Nationalsingspiel” was a sign of the\r\ngrowing popularity of this new form of entertainment, and gave a\r\npowerful incentive to the composers of such works. Operettas of Gluck,\r\nMozart, Salieri, Umlauf, Schenck and others attained great popularity\r\nhere. In 1786, Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf scored a signal success with\r\nhis “Doctor and Apothecary.” This versatile musician soon became a\r\nfavorite of the entire nation. Born at Vienna in 1739, he first became\r\nprominent as a violinist. Later his symphonies, concertos, quartets,\r\noratorios, etc., became well known. In all these forms, however, he was\r\nsurpassed by others. He possessed, it is true, much cleverness, but his\r\ncounterpoint was not faultless, and he wrote too much and too\r\nsuperficially. In comedy and farce he took the lead. His melodies are\r\nlively and flowing, characteristic and very catching. He learned much\r\nfrom Haydn, but something also from French composers. His “Doctor and\r\nApothecary,” “Jeremiah Knicker,” and “Red Riding Hood” gained for him\r\ngreat popularity. In all, he wrote twenty-eight such works. His\r\nautobiography, published in 1801, two years after his death, is also a\r\nwork of remarkable freshness and interest.\r\n\r\nIn Gotha, the conductor, George Benda (1721–99), produced operas which\r\nbecame popular in Germany. His melodramas, in which the text was spoken\r\nto the accompaniment of fitting music, were novelties, and became even\r\nmore favorably known. Munich was identified with more serious\r\nundertakings in dramatic music through Peter von Winter (1754–1825),\r\nCourt Kapellmeister. This once highly esteemed master composed numerous\r\noperas, the most popular of which were “The Labyrinth,” “Marie of\r\nMantalban,” and “Unterbrochene Opferfest.” The last is still\r\noccasionally performed. Likewise Mannheim—which from Mozart’s time until\r\nto-day has been devoted to the highest interests of music—became the\r\nscene of serious operatic endeavors. Ignaz Holzbauer (1711–83) wrote\r\nseveral operas during his conductorship of the theatre in that city.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent of the composers who succeeded Dittersdorf was Johann\r\nFriedrich Reichardt, whose interesting literary work, “Letters of an\r\nObservant Traveller,” is full of useful information. Born in 1752, he\r\nbecame orchestral conductor to Frederick the Great in 1775, and was\r\nsalt-inspector in a town near Halle, at the time of his death in 1814.\r\nHe was liberally educated, travelled much, and was acquainted with many\r\nof the prominent persons of his time. Few of his works have lived, and\r\nthose which have survived are chiefly songs. He produced, however, an\r\nenormous amount of music. His imagination was not equal to his\r\nunderstanding or his artistic intentions, and, indeed, he was to a great\r\nextent a mere copyist. A single new form is due to him, the\r\n“Liederspiel,” the musical part of which, as the name suggests, consists\r\nonly of songs.\r\n\r\nThe development of the opera in Germany, during the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries, has now been traced, and next we will turn our\r\nattention to the progress of instrumental music after Sebastian Bach.\r\n\r\nNo more remarkable instance of lack of appreciation of a great man’s\r\ngenius has ever been known than that furnished by the history of Bach’s\r\nworks. The reasons for this are perhaps twofold. Like Shakespeare, Bach\r\nmust have been ignorant of the supreme excellence of his artistic\r\ncreations. Hence, like many other great men, he occupied himself little\r\nwith the dissemination of his works, except those used in teaching. Not\r\nonly the musical world, but even Bach’s immediate family and pupils were\r\nunable to appreciate his significance and to use his compositions in a\r\nway most advantageous to the development of music. It would indeed be\r\ninteresting to know what difference it might have made in the\r\ndevelopment of music in Germany if Haydn, and especially Mozart, had\r\nenjoyed opportunities of intimate acquaintance with Bach’s works.[24]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHANN FRIEDRICH REICHARDT.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOnly a few of his organ compositions, the “Well-Tempered Clavichord” and\r\nsome of his other clavier music, seem to have been generally known in\r\nHaydn’s and Mozart’s time. It was only indirectly through his sons and\r\nother pupils that his powerful influence on instrumental music was then\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nAmong Bach’s numerous pupils the most noted, besides his own sons, were\r\nKrebs, Altnickol, Agricola, Vogler, and the theorists, Marpurg and\r\nKirnberger. His most distinguished sons were, Wilhelm Friedemann, Carl\r\nPhilipp Emanuel, Johann Christoph Friedrich, known as the Bückeburg\r\nBach, and Johann Christian, called the Milanese Bach. Wilhelm Friedemann\r\nBach (1710–84) was the eldest son of Sebastian Bach. He was a genius,\r\nand his father bestowed great care on his musical training, and had\r\ngreat hopes of his future. He studied at the St. Thomas School and\r\nuniversity of Leipsic, where he distinguished himself in mathematics.\r\nFor a number of years he held a position as organist at Dresden. In 1747\r\nhe became director and organist at Halle. In later years he led a wild\r\nand wandering life, and finally died in utter want and misery in Berlin.\r\nHe was perhaps the greatest organist of his time, and was famous for his\r\nwonderful improvisations. He wrote a large number of compositions, many\r\nof which are preserved in the Berlin Royal Library, but few of which are\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nCarl Philipp Emanuel Bach was born at Weimar in 1714. In his youth he\r\nstudied law thoroughly, and busied himself with music rather as an\r\namateur than as one who intended to make it a profession. His attention\r\nwas devoted chiefly to piano playing and the art of improvisation,\r\nwhich, thanks to his father’s rare teaching, he carried to the highest\r\ndegree of perfection. He was destined, after all, to make music his\r\nlife-work. He had hardly completed his university studies when he\r\nreceived an invitation from the crown prince of Prussia, afterward\r\nFrederick the Great, to accept a musical position at court. He accepted,\r\nand remained in his service for a number of years. In 1767 he became\r\nsuccessor of Telemann as conductor of the opera at Hamburg, where he\r\nremained until his death. By his daily practice in improvisation,\r\nEmanuel Bach acquired a freedom and elegance of style equalled by no\r\nother German master except his father. His position and intercourse with\r\nthe best society were not without good influence on his music. He\r\npossessed hardly a tithe of his father’s genius; but, as he lived more\r\nin the world, he became a man of fashion and popularity. In his day his\r\nname was far better known than that of his father, and musicians looked\r\nupon Emanuel Bach as the great authority. Even Mozart said of him: “He\r\nis the father; we are mere children. Those of us who can do anything\r\nright in music have learned it of him. Although we could not be\r\nsatisfied nowadays to do what he did, nevertheless, no one was able to\r\nequal him in what he did.” He was an inferior vocal composer. It was\r\nchiefly as a clavichord player and composer that he took first rank. His\r\nrefined style and uncommon finish of execution excited universal wonder.\r\nEmanuel Bach’s vocal works embrace two oratorios; twenty-two passions;\r\nsacred cantatas; Singspiele; sanctus for two choirs; sacred and secular\r\nsongs, etc. His works for clavier are very numerous, consisting of\r\nsonatas, concertos and solos. Eighteen of his orchestral compositions\r\nare published by Breitkopf and Härtel.\r\n\r\nEmanuel Bach’s talent as a teacher was evinced in his celebrated\r\ntreatise, “On the True Art of Playing the Clavichord,” which contains\r\nthe principles of all good piano playing. But his greatest services to\r\nmodern music were rendered in his sonatas and symphonies, in which he\r\nnot only enlarged the form, but also increased the means of expression\r\nand of instrumental effects. Emanuel Bach exercised a great influence on\r\nthe clavier sonata, and first brought it into prominence. The so-called\r\nsonatas of Domenico Scarlatti were single, brilliant movements which\r\nresembled the prelude. Sebastian Bach’s sonatas for the organ, clavier\r\nand violin, etc., in three or four movements, were more or less fugal\r\nand strict. Emanuel Bach combined the solidity of the style of his\r\nfather with the brilliancy and lightness of Scarlatti. Although it\r\nremained for Haydn to develop fully the principle of free thematic\r\nmusic, the germ of the modern style existed in the sonatas of Emanuel\r\nBach. The habit of improvisation gave full scope to the play of his\r\nimagination, and consequently his works are characterized by a certain\r\nease and brilliancy which distinguish him from his predecessors. He made\r\nmore use than formerly of contrasted themes in the several movements of\r\nthe sonata, and they were brought into relation to each other by means\r\nof free passages. His “Salon” style is distinguished for its elegance\r\nand grace, ornateness and playfulness, and well represents the polite\r\nworld in which he lived.\r\n\r\nHaving traced the early development of organ and clavier music, we will\r\nturn our attention, for a moment, to the growth of orchestral music to\r\nthe advent of Haydn, and the so-called classical period of modern\r\ninstrumental music. During the first half of the seventeenth century the\r\ninstruments used in connection with the opera served a subordinate\r\nposition. The accompaniments of the recitatives and arias consisted of a\r\nground bass (_basso continuo_) for chittarone, organ, clavier, etc.,\r\nwhich supplied the chords indicated by figures. In the opera-madrigals\r\nthe orchestral accompaniment was simply a reproduction of the vocal\r\nparts, on wind and stringed instruments. In the course of time\r\ninstrumental ritornelli were introduced to relieve the solo voices, and\r\nmelodic phrases were given to the instruments. The first operas\r\ngenerally opened with a flourish of trumpets or with a madrigal played\r\nby the instruments alone; sometimes dances played by the instruments\r\nwere introduced in course of the opera.\r\n\r\nThe opera overture was invented subsequently, probably by Lully. It\r\nconsisted, at first, of three short movements, slow, quick, slow.\r\nScarlatti and his contemporaries adopted the overture, and changed the\r\norder of the movements to _allegro_, _adagio_, _allegro_.\r\n\r\nWith the perfection of the violin and the other stringed instruments,\r\nabout the beginning of the eighteenth century, solo playing became more\r\nand more artistic. With Corelli, sonatas and suites for one or more\r\nviolins and clavier became the fashion. At this time the orchestra was\r\nwell organized, so far as the true relation of the string band to the\r\nwind instruments is concerned.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of chamber music was encouraged by titled and\r\nfashionable people, and virtuosos on various orchestral instruments\r\nappeared. Thus instrumental music began to be cultivated independent of\r\nthe opera and church music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES PHILIPPE EMMANUEL BACH]\r\n\r\nThe three-movement form suggested by the overture was the type of this\r\nindependent orchestral music, under the names of symphony, concerto, or\r\nsuite. Such were the orchestral symphonies of Sammartini, the famous\r\nMilanese conductor of the first half of the eighteenth century. His is\r\nthe first prominent name in this field. He was soon followed by German\r\ncomposers, among whom were Stamitz, J. C. Bach, Abel, Wagenseil,\r\nCannabich and Emanuel Bach.\r\n\r\nAmong noted German instrumental soloists of this period were Johann\r\nGeorg Pisendel (1687–1755), who was celebrated as a violinist, and\r\ncomposed concertos for solo violin and string quartet, which were\r\nconsidered as among the best of that time.\r\n\r\nFranz Benda (1709–86), Georg Benda and Ignaz Holzbauer (1711–83) were\r\nlikewise able masters of the violin, and had large experience as\r\norchestral musicians.\r\n\r\nUnder Stamitz and Cannabich the Mannheim orchestra became a famous\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nJohann Karl Stamitz, who was born in 1719, became in 1745 director of\r\nmusic for the Elector of Mannheim. His works have no interest for the\r\nhearers of to-day, but in the characteristic elements of the modern\r\nform, they represent a distinct advance over those of his predecessors.\r\nIn general, they are imitations of the symphonies of Sammartini. The\r\npupil and successor of Stamitz, Christian Cannabich, was born in 1731.\r\nConsidering the superlative praise which Mozart bestowed upon this\r\nconductor, we cannot doubt that the playing of the Mannheim band was of\r\ngreat service to Mozart in his orchestral works, by increasing his\r\nknowledge of instrumental expression.\r\n\r\nIn 1756, the year of Mozart’s birth, this orchestra had two concert\r\nmasters, ten first and ten second violins, four violas, four\r\nvioloncellos, two contra-basses, two flutes, two oboes, two bassoons,\r\nfour horns, twelve trumpets, two kettle drums, two organists, besides\r\ntwenty-four singers. About 1767 clarinets were added, and years later\r\nMozart learned how to use the clarinets from hearing them in the\r\nMannheim orchestra.\r\n\r\nBurney says of the Mannheim orchestra, “This is the birthplace of the\r\ncrescendo and diminuendo”; and the philosopher, Schubart, is recorded as\r\nsaying of the orchestra under Cannabich, “Here the forte is a thunder,\r\nthe crescendo a cataract, the diminuendo a crystal stream babbling away\r\ninto the far distance, the piano a breeze of spring.” As for the\r\nsymphonies of Cannabich, they do not seem to represent any advance\r\ntoward the establishment of modern form.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding account it will be seen that the external form of the\r\nsymphony was already partly determined when Haydn began his artistic\r\ncareer. Under his treatment and that of his successors its growth, in\r\nall respects, was marvellous.\r\n\r\nHaydn is justly called the real creator of the modern symphony and\r\nstring quartet. He enlarged the works, as a whole, extended the separate\r\nmovements in their larger and smaller divisions, and developed the\r\nso-called art of free thematic treatment. He first gave musical\r\nclearness, order and variety to the form, and adapted it to the\r\nexpression of the multitude of different phases of musical thought. The\r\nstricter thematic imitations of the older masters gave way to that free\r\nthematic play which has been an element of all concert music since his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn Haydn’s development of this principle we recognize a power of\r\ninvention and fertility of imagination only equalled by few others. The\r\noriginality of Haydn cannot be over-estimated. He discovered a new world\r\nin music. An infinite variety of musical effect was produced by his new\r\nart of motive-building. Haydn also laid the foundation of modern\r\norchestration. He understood, as no one before his day, the true scope\r\nof the combined stringed instruments. In his string quartets, even more\r\nthan his symphonies, his mastery of the technical effects of the solo\r\nstrings is most complete; for though the possibilities of tone-color are\r\ngreater with the full orchestra, yet in Haydn’s quartets there is a\r\nwealth of musical expression and a certain charm of style which place\r\nthem beside those of Mozart and Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThe tragic fire and grandeur of thought so characteristic of Beethoven\r\nhave their counterpart in the geniality, humor and playfulness of Haydn.\r\nThe symphonies of Beethoven may be compared with tragedies, Haydn’s with\r\ncomedies. “Papa” Haydn is never tragic nor sarcastic. His seriousness is\r\nimbued with contentment, never tinged with despair. He overflows with\r\ngood humor, and is fond of a musical joke now and then; yet he is\r\nintensely serious at heart, and his mirthful compositions never leave\r\nthe impression of superficiality. Haydn prepared the ground for Mozart\r\nand Beethoven. One master cannot be considered without reference to the\r\nother. Mozart and Beethoven obtained the form of the symphony from\r\nHaydn; on the other hand, it was not until Mozart’s last works had\r\nappeared that Haydn produced his finest symphonies and quartets. In his\r\nuse of the wind instruments, Mozart was the indispensable teacher of\r\nboth Haydn and Beethoven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BERLIN OPERA HOUSE.\r\n\r\n  _From a photograph._\r\n]\r\n\r\nMozart did not enlarge the general form of the symphony, etc., as given\r\nby Haydn, but he rounded and beautified the details of the several\r\nmovements. His themes and melodies are more beautiful and expressive,\r\nand their working up more impressive and emotional. Mozart’s last works\r\nhave that perfection of form and depth of sentiment which belong only to\r\nthe highest manifestations of genius. Mozart left his stamp on all\r\nbranches of music; he is rightly considered as the universal master. It\r\nwas his mission to unite and beautify the national differences of style,\r\nand give them the impress of his own rare individuality. European music,\r\nfor the first time in history, was concentrated in him.\r\n\r\nBeethoven in his earlier period shows the influence of Haydn and Mozart,\r\nyet he set the stamp of originality on his very first works. He was\r\ndestined to bring the higher forms of instrumental music to the highest\r\npoint of development. Although he ultimately revealed a new world in his\r\nmature works, he remained true to the “sonata” form from first to last.\r\nHe did not seek to revolutionize musical form; on the contrary, he built\r\non the solid foundations already laid. Great as were his achievements as\r\na musician, in the grand outlines and proportions, dynamic expression,\r\nthematic treatment and instrumentation of his works, we lose sight of\r\nthe musician in contemplating the greater tone-poet, who touched every\r\nchord of the heart, who uplifted and broadened the minds and souls of\r\nmen, whose long struggle to rise above the sorrows and ills of life\r\nendowed his music with a spirituality and religiousness beyond that of\r\nall others, and which places him among the greatest poets and prophets\r\nof humanity. Further considerations on Beethoven as composer are\r\ncontained in the special article of this work. (See page 337.)\r\n\r\nBefore Beethoven fully entered on his great life-work, Haydn and Mozart\r\nhad spread the fame of German music throughout the world. Their\r\ninfluence was universal, and they had many disciples and imitators, of\r\nwhom Gyrowetz, Pleyel, Wranitsky, Kozeluch, Romberg, F. E. Fesca,\r\nEybler, Süssmayer and Seyfried were prominent. These composers enjoyed\r\ngreat popularity for a time, and assisted in spreading the love of\r\ninstrumental music among the people; but as their music was devoid of\r\noriginality and marked individuality, it has not survived. Of these\r\nmasters, perhaps the most noteworthy were Pleyel, Romberg and Gyrowetz.\r\n\r\nIgnaz Joseph Pleyel (1757–1831) was the favorite pupil of Haydn, who had\r\na high opinion of Pleyel’s abilities. Though not so productive as his\r\nteacher, Pleyel was a very facile and pleasing composer; his many\r\nsymphonies, quartets and quintets were very popular for a long time.\r\nGreater things were expected of him than he fulfilled; even Mozart, on\r\nhearing one of Pleyel’s earlier quartets, thought that he might some day\r\nreplace Haydn. But Pleyel did not progress; his later works copied\r\nHaydn’s style without his spirit, and consequently his music has\r\nentirely died out.\r\n\r\nAndreas Romberg (1767–1821) sprang from a very musical family, which\r\ncounted among its members a number of noted musicians. His cousin,\r\nBernhard Romberg, was the celebrated violoncello virtuoso and composer.\r\n\r\nAndreas began his career as a concert violinist; subsequently he was\r\ncourt chapelmaster at Gotha. He composed several operas, church music,\r\nsix symphonies, and chamber music. His most popular cantata, “The Lay of\r\nthe Bell,” is still occasionally sung in England and America. The music\r\nof Romberg is pleasing and well written. Mozart was evidently his model.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of all these epigones was Adalbert Gyrowetz\r\n(1763–1850), who presents the melancholy example of an able and worthy\r\nmaster who entirely outlived his fame. As a young man he had a brilliant\r\nreputation in France and England. From 1804 to 1831 he was conductor of\r\nthe Imperial Opera at Vienna, where many of his operas were produced.\r\nGyrowetz composed thirty operas, Singspiele, and melodramas, and over\r\nforty ballets.\r\n\r\nAmong his best operas were “Der Augenarzt,” “Die Prüfung” (which\r\nBeethoven liked), “Agnes Sorel” and “Helene.” He also composed four\r\nItalian operas, nineteen masses, besides many other vocal works. He was\r\nequally prolific in all forms of instrumental music, and wrote over\r\nsixty symphonies and as many string quartets, besides quintets,\r\novertures, serenades, marches and dances and numerous sonatas, trios,\r\nnocturnes, etc., for the pianoforte. Gyrowetz possessed many of the\r\nqualifications of a great composer, yet he lacked the one thing\r\nneedful,—originality. His facility betrayed him into weakness, and\r\nunconsciously he became an imitator of Haydn and Mozart. He witnessed\r\nthe entire rise and culmination of Beethoven’s genius. As he outlived\r\nBeethoven by twenty-three years, he must have fully realized the\r\nepoch-making character of his great works. Gyrowetz suffered from\r\nneglect and poverty in his old age. None of his music is known to the\r\npresent age, and his name is hardly remembered, except by those familiar\r\nwith musical history. In the annals of music there is no more striking\r\nexample of one who accomplished so much who was destined to see it all\r\npass away and fall into oblivion.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the eighteenth century, under the sway of the opera and\r\nthe free forms of instrumental music, the style of church music in\r\ngeneral became more melodious, ornate, and sensuous, but less earnest\r\nand religious in tone, than in the time of Bach and Handel. Eberlin and\r\nMichael Haydn were prominent representatives of this lighter style.\r\nMozart’s earlier church compositions were modelled on theirs.\r\n\r\nMichael Haydn (1737–1806), brother of Joseph Haydn, wrote a large number\r\nof masses, requiems, litanies, vespers, offertories, oratorios,\r\ncantatas, German sacred songs, as well as operas. Mozart and his father\r\nhad a high opinion of his church music; Joseph Haydn considered it\r\nsuperior to his own: time, however, has reversed his judgment. Michael\r\nHaydn’s mass in D minor, “Lauda Sion,” and “Tenebræ” in E flat are still\r\nprized by musicians, but the mass of his works are forgotten.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of the more severe church style in Germany during the\r\neighteenth century were Fux, Fasch and Albrechtsberger. Johann Joseph\r\nFux (1660–1741) was chapelmaster of St. Stephan’s and court composer in\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\nFux had a rare mastery of counterpoint, which he exercised in his\r\nnumerous church compositions. His “Missa canonica” is a marvel of\r\ncanonic skill and ingenuity, and replete with effects of modulation. His\r\nfame, however, rests on his transcendent abilities as a musical\r\ntheorist. His treatise on counterpoint, “Gradus ad Parnassum,” has\r\nremained in use for more than a century and a half. There have been many\r\neditions; it has been translated from the original Latin into German,\r\nFrench, Italian and English. Both Joseph and Michael Haydn were indebted\r\nto the “Gradus” for their knowledge of counterpoint, and Mozart studied\r\nit with equal diligence.\r\n\r\nCarl Friedrich Christian Fasch (1736–1800) is known chiefly as the\r\nfounder of the celebrated Singakademie of Berlin. Fasch was industrious\r\nas a composer in the _a capella_ style. His sixteen-part mass is his\r\nmost important work.\r\n\r\nJohann Georg Albrechtsberger (1736–1809) was court organist and\r\nchapelmaster at St. Stephan’s of Vienna. He composed over two hundred\r\nand sixty works, among which his “Te Deum” is best known.\r\nAlbrechtsberger was especially distinguished as a musical theorist and\r\nteacher. Among his pupils were Beethoven, Hummel, Seyfried and Eybler.\r\nHis strict system did not satisfy Beethoven; yet the exercises published\r\nas Beethoven’s “Studienbuch” show the benefit that he had received from\r\nAlbrechtsberger’s instruction.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious and remarkable characters of this period was\r\nGeorge Joseph Vogler, called Abt Vogler (1749–1814), whose exact place\r\nin musical history is not easy to determine. In his own day a wide\r\ndivergence of opinion was expressed as to his merits; by some, including\r\nMozart, he was considered to be a veritable charlatan, by others an\r\n“epoch-making” artist. Want of space precludes an extended account of\r\nhis career, which was full of picturesque incidents. Vogler travelled\r\nmuch, and tried his fortune in various places; wherever he went he drew\r\nattention by his organ playing, his revolutionary ideas on teaching\r\nharmony, and innovations in organ building. Vogler was a religious\r\ndevotee; at Rome he was made Chamberlain to the Pope, Knight of the\r\nGolden Spur, and Abbé. He was remarkably active as composer, teacher,\r\norgan player, and theorist. He wrote for the theatre as well as the\r\nchurch. Although most of his music is shelved, his Requiem and Symphony\r\nin C are not forgotten. Mendelssohn bought out his symphony at the\r\nGewandhaus; the Requiem contains original and impressive effects.\r\n\r\nVogler’s vanity led him to harmonize chorals in order to show how much\r\nhe could improve on Sebastian Bach. His organ playing was degraded by\r\ndescriptive “thunder-storms” and other claptrap effects. With all his\r\nfaults, he was a man of ideas, and as a teacher aroused genuine\r\nenthusiasm among his pupils. His attacks on various established errors\r\nand prejudices of music appealed strongly to his young disciples, Von\r\nWeber and Meyerbeer, and fired them with knightly ardor. All his pupils\r\nwere devoted to him; he was equally fond of them, and called them his\r\n“boys.” The picture of Vogler’s home life at the Tonschule at Darmstadt\r\nis charming. His pupils were his friends and companions. Weber wrote, on\r\nhearing of Vogler’s death, “Our beloved master will ever live in our\r\nhearts.” Browning has celebrated Abt Vogler in his remarkable poem\r\nbearing that name.\r\n\r\nDuring the later half of the eighteenth century the pianoforte gradually\r\nsuperseded the older clavichord. With the rapid improvements in\r\npiano-making, piano playing and composing became more and more artistic.\r\nHaydn, Mozart and Clementi were influenced at first by the clavier style\r\nof Emanuel Bach, but soon developed new features in their piano works.\r\nClementi, especially, carried technique to a point beyond others of his\r\ntime. His celebrated studies, “Gradus ad Parnassum,” are indispensable\r\nin the training of pianists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHANN LUDWIG DUSSEK.\r\n\r\n  Portrait from a bust by Callamard, engraved by Quenedey.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMozart brought the piano concerto into prominence, and set the example\r\nfollowed by Beethoven and others in this form. The concertos of Mozart\r\nare his chief compositions for the pianoforte. The best of them have a\r\nplace beside his last symphonies and string quartets. The grace and\r\nelegance of his piano style, and the perfect balance between the solo\r\ninstrument and the orchestra, render his concertos models of form and\r\nbeauty. Among the contemporaries and followers of Mozart and Clementi in\r\nthis branch were Steibelt (176 –1823), Sterkel (1750–1817), Kozeluch\r\n(1753–1814), Hässler (1747–1822), Gelinde (1757–1825), Dussek, Woelfl,\r\nHummel, Cramer and Field. Johann Ludwig Dussek (1760–1872) was a\r\nbrilliant representative of the piano style, who showed originality in\r\nhis modulations and use of dissonances. There is a certain romantic\r\nfeeling that characterizes his best piano compositions, as for instance,\r\nhis “La Consolation” and “La Chasse.”\r\n\r\nJoseph Woelfl (1772–1812) had a brilliant career as a piano virtuoso. He\r\nvisited Paris and London and other cities, where his playing created\r\ngreat astonishment. At Vienna he met Beethoven (in his younger days) as\r\na friendly rival in extemporaneous playing. Notwithstanding the partisan\r\nfeeling among their audiences, personally they appeared to have a mutual\r\nrespect for each other. Though Woelfl had greater execution and equal\r\nfacility in improvising, Beethoven excelled him and all others in\r\nimagination and inspiration, in the power of moving the feelings of his\r\nlisteners. Woelfl was noted for his breadth of style, as well as his\r\nbreadth of hand-grasp; with his enormous hands he could cover two thirds\r\nof the key-board.\r\n\r\nJohann Nepomuk Hummel (1778–1837) was the favorite pupil of Mozart. To\r\nMozart’s example Hummel owed his delicate touch, his elegant and\r\nfinished execution, his skill in improvisation, the clearness and solid\r\nconstruction of his pieces,—characteristics which rendered him in his\r\nprime the best representative of the expressive style. For a time he was\r\neven considered as the equal of Beethoven as a piano composer. Nowadays\r\nHummel is underrated and called a “dull classic.” His septet in D minor\r\nis a masterpiece, and a few of his best piano concertos and sonatas are\r\nworthy of study. His two masses are sterling works. Johann Baptist\r\nCramer (1771–1858) forms the link between Clementi and Hummel. Cramer\r\nwas noted for his expressive touch on the piano. His numerous sonatas,\r\netc., are shelved, but his noble piano studies live as classical models.\r\nThey hold almost a unique place, for they combine beautiful musical\r\nideas with systematic technical training. In these respects they excel\r\nthe “Gradus” of his teacher, Clementi. They are indispensable to every\r\nthorough student of the instrument.\r\n\r\nTwo other talented pupils of Clementi should be mentioned: Ludwig Berger\r\n(1777–1838), the distinguished pianist, composer, and teacher of\r\nMendelssohn, Taubert, Henselt and others; and August Klengel\r\n(1784–1852), who is less known as a pianist than as the composer of\r\ncanons and fugues, which show a remarkable command of counterpoint.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s great influence on piano music is dwelt upon in the special\r\narticle (see page 337). His pupil, Ferdinand Ries (1784–1838), was one\r\nof the leading pianists of his day, and was also a productive composer\r\nin all branches of music. As he was under the spell of Beethoven’s\r\ngenius, he failed to show any marked individuality of style.\r\n\r\nHis contemporary, Wenzel Tomaschek (1774–1850), displayed more\r\noriginality, though he, too, was overshadowed by Beethoven’s greatness.\r\nTomaschek, during his long career, was highly esteemed as a composer,\r\npianist and teacher. His admirers called him the “Schiller of music,” on\r\naccount of his pure and elevated musical thought. His numerous piano\r\ncompositions merit more appreciation than they have generally received.\r\nSchumann admired his music. His “Eclogues” and “Rhapsodies” are\r\ncharming, naïve, imaginative and original.\r\n\r\nHaving given an account of the principal contemporaries of Haydn, Mozart\r\nand Beethoven in dramatic, church and instrumental music, a few words\r\nshould be added on the subject of German song composers prior to\r\nSchubert.\r\n\r\nThe national sentiment which encouraged native opera led also to a\r\nrevival of interest in the German Lied. It was not until the second half\r\nof the century, when operettas had become the rage in Germany, that\r\ntalented musicians turned their attention to this neglected branch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHANN NEPOMUK HUMMEL.\r\n\r\n  Portrait by F. H. Müller, engraved by Esslinger.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEmanuel Bach and two other pupils of his father, Christian Nichelman\r\n(1717–81) and Johann Friedrich Agricola (1720–74), devoted themselves\r\nconsiderably to song composing. All the operetta composers we have\r\npreviously mentioned composed separate songs, which, together with\r\nsingle numbers of their operettas, attained widespread popularity. One\r\nof the best song composers of the time was Johann Peter Schulz\r\n(1747–1800). His “Lieder in Volkston” were modelled on the old\r\nfolk-songs of Germany. Schulz had true German lyric feeling; he pointed\r\nout the way followed by Schubert a generation later. Schulz’s songs have\r\nlong been universal favorites. It is a strong evidence of the innate\r\nnaturalness and strength of his songs that they should have retained\r\ntheir place in the affections of the youth of Germany. They are still\r\nsung in German school-rooms.\r\n\r\nAs German literature began to free itself from French influence, which\r\nhad been so potent during the reign of Frederick the Great, poets arose\r\nwho gave voice to true German feeling and sentiment. The lyrics of\r\nHagedorn, Gellert, Klopstock, Gleim, Kleist and others furnish material\r\nfor composers. Bürger, the celebrated author of “Lenore,” enriched\r\nGerman literature with his ballads, many of which became popular in\r\nmusical form. It was Herder who revived true enthusiasm and feeling for\r\nthe old Volkslied, and with the rise of Goethe’s genius a new era dawned\r\non lyric poetry, and inspired song composers to take higher flights.\r\nJohann Rudolph Zumsteeg (1760–1803) was the pioneer composer of ballads.\r\n\r\nReichardt, of whom mention has already been made, was the first to win\r\ngeneral approbation by his settings of Goethe’s lyrics. Carl Friedrich\r\nZelter (1758–1833) was more closely identified with Goethe, both as\r\nfriend and composer. In 1800, Zelter became director of the Berlin\r\nSingakademie. He established the first male chorus club\r\n(Männergesangverein) of Germany, which became the model of the many\r\nsimilar clubs.\r\n\r\nHaydn, Mozart and Beethoven did not devote special attention to song\r\ncomposing; their life-work was accomplished in a larger field. Yet the\r\ncanzonets of Haydn, the charming “Veilchen” of Mozart and the romantic\r\n“An die ferne Geliebte” of Beethoven are songs of much greater merit\r\nthan any others of their time, prior to Schubert.\r\n\r\nThe example and presence of Beethoven inspired Schubert to take the\r\nhighest flights in his music. Like his great pattern and guide, he lived\r\nwithdrawn from the public, and devoted himself heart and soul to the\r\npursuit of his beloved calling. Schubert’s numerous symphonies,\r\nquartets, sonatas, masses, cantatas and oratorios are among the\r\npriceless possessions of musical art. It is, however, as a song composer\r\nthat Schubert stands forth as a great and original master. In Schubert’s\r\ninstrumental music the fecundity of musical ideas, the profusion and\r\nbeauty of melody, which never failed him,—in a word, the wealth of his\r\nlyric power,—often stand in the way of the clear and cogent thematic\r\ndevelopment of his music.\r\n\r\nSchubert speaks the sincere language of the heart, and captivates the\r\near with the exquisite beauty of his melody. He gave new significance to\r\nthe instrumental accompaniment, using it both to intensify the emotional\r\nexpression and to enhance the effectiveness of the vocal part. His\r\nrhythm is manifold and animated; his harmony strong and daring. “He\r\nunderstood how to make the hearer believe that the keys of C major and F\r\nsharp minor are twin sisters,” says a well-known critic. Nor is it alone\r\nthe lyric power which moves us in listening to Schubert’s songs. When\r\nthe situation demands it, certain epic and dramatic characteristics come\r\nto light: as in the “Erlking,” perhaps the most popular of all ballads.\r\nThe unflagging spontaneity which distinguishes his songs has not been\r\nmatched by any of his successors; and his productiveness was something\r\nmarvellous. “If fruitfulness,” says Schumann, “be a characteristic of\r\ngenius, Schubert is certainly one of the greatest.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHANN BAPTIST CRAMER.\r\n\r\n  (See page 589.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt has been the custom among historians of music to consider the epoch\r\nof the older masters as the “classic period,” and to apply the term\r\n“romantic school” to a long list of modern composers of which Schubert,\r\nSchumann, Mendelssohn, Spohr and Weber are the most important names.\r\nSuch a classification is of considerable convenience; particularly as\r\nthe so-called romantic movement which pervaded literature was not far\r\nfrom contemporary with the appearance of these composers. But it would\r\nbe difficult to define and enumerate the various elements which enter\r\ninto the adjective “romantic” as used in this connection; for nearly all\r\nthe praiseworthy characteristics of these later composers are present in\r\ncertain great works of the so-called classical composers, not excepting\r\nhim who is considered so “unsympathetic” by many of the enthusiastic\r\nadmirers of modern music, Sebastian Bach. It is certainly true that the\r\ntone-poems of Beethoven possess romantic characteristics which have been\r\nmisunderstood or ignored by those who claim for his successors a wholly\r\nnew direction of musical development. But in a general way we recognize\r\nin modern “romantic” music the tendency to set less value on musical\r\nconstruction or form for its own sake than on the subjective expression\r\nof musical ideas. Further than this there has been a tendency to enlarge\r\nthe scope of descriptive music, not only in connection with the drama,\r\nbut in the application of fanciful titles to instrumental movements as\r\nexemplified by the piano pieces of Schumann.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOHANN PETER SCHULZ.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the same period was not without strong indications of\r\nsimilar changes in the domain of letters. We have not space to give\r\ndetails of literary history, but it may suffice to point out that, with\r\nthe advent of the music of Weber, Schumann and others, Germany was\r\noverflowing with intense sympathy and enthusiasm for the writings of\r\nByron and of the prose-poetizer, Jean Paul Richter.\r\n\r\nIn the general mental and emotional tendencies of the epoch, classic\r\ncalm and reflectiveness began to be lost in “romantic” storm and stress.\r\nThe first indications of the new school of composition are to be found\r\nin the works of two musicians whose lack of appreciation of Beethoven’s\r\ngenius is one of the anomalies of musical history. Both of them—Spohr\r\nand Weber—were great men, epoch-makers in certain things. The\r\ncompositions of the former have, indeed, been eclipsed by later\r\nachievements in music; but we ought not to underrate Spohr’s progressive\r\nzeal. His musical individuality was narrowed by mannerism; and yet\r\nwithin the limits of that individuality the variety of his work is\r\nenormous. In the development of violin technique his activity as teacher\r\nand soloist has borne rich fruit. His double quartets for strings have\r\nbecome well known, but perhaps the general popularity of Spohr’s works\r\nin this exceptional form has militated against their performance, and\r\nconsequently against the appreciation of other interesting works for odd\r\ncombinations of a small number of instruments, as for instance his octet\r\nand nonet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARL FRIEDRICH ZELTER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWeber, more than Spohr or any previous master, realized for the German\r\npeople their ideal of a truly national style of opera. His “Der\r\nFreischütz” appealed irresistibly to the popular taste for the romantic\r\nand supernatural, a phase of imagination embodied in the fairy tales and\r\ndomestic poetry of Germany. Spohr, in his “Berggeist,” “Faust” and\r\n“Jessonda,” had already worked in this field with considerable success;\r\nbut Weber, with greater musical genius, created in his “Der Freischütz”\r\nan opera which was destined to take as deep a root in the hearts of the\r\nGerman people as the “Zauberflöte” of Mozart, or “William Tell” of\r\nSchiller.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, “Euryanthe,” the most important work of Weber from\r\nthe musical dramatic point of view, did not win universal favor at\r\nfirst; but nowadays it is estimated at its true worth. In this\r\nmasterpiece, Weber pointed out the direction which Wagner instinctively\r\nfollowed, a new path which led to stupendous results in his\r\nmusic-dramas.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Marschner as a dramatic composer was stimulated and influenced\r\nby his friend and associate, Weber. “Hans Heiling” is considered his\r\nmasterpiece. We feel the influence of Weber and Marschner in the earlier\r\noperas of Wagner, though almost from the outset his powerful originality\r\nasserted itself. Lesser lights of the so-called romantic school were\r\nLindpaintner (1791–1858) and Reissiger (1798–1856). The best of\r\nLindpaintner’s numerous operas were “Der Vampyr,” “Der Bergkönig” and\r\n“Die Sicilianische Vesper.” Some of his symphonies, overtures, etc.,\r\nwere highly esteemed by his contemporaries, but his most popular works\r\nwere his songs, of which his “Roland” and “Standard Bearer” are\r\ncelebrated. Lindpaintner was one of the foremost orchestral conductors\r\nof his time. Reissiger succeeded Weber as conductor of the Royal Opera\r\nat Dresden. His most popular operas were “Turandot,” “Ahnenschatz” and\r\n“Adele von Foix.” They are no longer given on the German stage.\r\n“Kapellmeister” music well describes the works of both Reissiger and\r\nLindpaintner. They had nothing in particular to say, and said it\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\nBefore Wagner’s conquest of the stage the opera-loving public of Germany\r\nwere largely under the sway of foreign composers. The sudden and\r\nuniversal popularity of Rossini, Bellini and other Italian composers\r\nabsorbed public attention, and native composers were cast into the\r\nshade. The example of Meyerbeer was hardly stimulating to the national\r\nmusical feeling. Meyerbeer, it is true, was a German, trained by German\r\nmasters, but his masterpieces were written for the Paris Opera: his\r\n“Robert,” “Prophet” and “Huguenots” are eclectic in character, in which\r\nItalian, French and German elements of style are blended; hence his\r\nworld-wide influence has not been as a German, but as a cosmopolitan in\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nThis indifference of the German public was not confined to the field of\r\nopera; even Beethoven was neglected during the era of Rossini, and did\r\nnot live to see his symphonies appreciated by the many. With the rise of\r\nMendelssohn and Schumann, however, a new impulse was given to German\r\nmusic, and the great public trained to appreciate the older as well as\r\nnewer masters. Under the shadow of the St. Thomas School of Leipsic,\r\nwith its glorious musical traditions, a group of gifted artists\r\nassembled, who represent a new and bright epoch in the further\r\ndevelopment of modern music. Mendelssohn’s noble character as a man, his\r\nearnest, aspiring devotion to his art, cannot be over-estimated. His\r\nremarkable gifts as composer, pianist, and conductor served to gain the\r\nattention of the public everywhere; and this advantage, combined with\r\nhis personal magnetism, enabled him to accomplish more for the\r\nadvancement of music than others of his time.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn’s genius was exercised in almost every form of musical\r\ncomposition, except the opera.\r\n\r\nThere are two peculiar phases of his musical individuality which are\r\nmost remarkable: first, the fantastic, imaginative vein so happily\r\nbrought to light in his scherzos, the most charming of which is the\r\nscherzo in the “Midsummer Night’s Dream”; second, the lyric element,\r\nwhich is not only characteristic of his “Songs without Words,” but of\r\nnearly all his slow movements. His most poetical and romantic works are\r\nhis concert overtures to “Midsummer Night’s Dream,” “Fingal’s Cave,”\r\n“Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage,” “Melusina” and “Ruy Blas.” These\r\novertures are “program” music in the best sense of the term, and hold a\r\nunique place among the foremost.\r\n\r\nMendelssohn’s genial and refined nature mirrored itself in his music.\r\nNevertheless, with all the beauty, sweetness, classic form, and purity\r\nof his music, one thing is missed,—tragic depth and fire. He did not\r\ntouch the deepest chords of the heart like Beethoven and Bach, perhaps\r\nbecause his existence was not clouded by adversity, or because he\r\narrived without serious struggles at the complete development of his\r\nartistic powers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC IN LEIPSIC\r\n]\r\n\r\nSchumann, on the contrary, for years was denied the artistic\r\nopportunities and companionships for which he longed. It was only in his\r\nmaturity that he acquired the technical facility which had become second\r\nnature with Mendelssohn long before he was of age.\r\n\r\nIn depth of sentiment and emotional power, Schumann was the worthy\r\nsuccessor of Beethoven. Like Mendelssohn, he was an earnest student of\r\nBach’s music, and we perceive the influence of the older master in such\r\ncompositions as Schumann’s fugues on Bach’s name, the finales of his\r\npiano quartet and quintet, and the grand polyphonic opening of his C\r\nmajor Symphony. Like the old Leipsic cantor, Schumann was a subtle\r\nponderer and deep thinker. As a harmonist he showed more freedom and\r\nboldness than Mendelssohn. In his orchestration he followed the\r\nfootsteps of Mendelssohn, but does not show equal mastery. His piano\r\nworks stand higher, and here he owed much to Chopin, whom he appreciated\r\nmore keenly than did Mendelssohn, and followed his example in the use of\r\nextended chords, unusual figures of accompaniment, pedal effects, etc.,\r\nas well as in poetical imagination, that rendered every little dance or\r\nmelody a miniature poem in tones.\r\n\r\nIn his four great symphonies, Schumann ranks next to Beethoven and\r\nSchubert. As a song composer he stands nearest to Schubert in\r\nspontaneity and poetic feeling. In spite of the gloomy melancholy that\r\nbroods in some of his music, he, like Beethoven, was a true humorist.\r\nSchumann did not abandon the symphonic form, as perfected by Beethoven,\r\nbut, like Schubert and others, stamped it with his own individuality;\r\nhis poetical and romantic nature are revealed in all his creations.\r\n\r\nAmong the gifted associates and disciples of Mendelssohn and Schumann\r\nwere the following composers:—\r\n\r\nNiels Wilhelm Gade (1817–91) first attracted attention by his “Ossian”\r\noverture. The production of his first symphony, under Mendelssohn’s\r\ndirection at the Gewandhaus in Leipsic, made his name generally known;\r\nand subsequently Gade was associated with Mendelssohn as conductor of\r\nthe Gewandhaus concerts. Although Gade was under the influence of\r\nMendelssohn and Schumann, his musical nature was not the reflex of\r\ntheirs; on the contrary, his Danish nationality comes to light in his\r\nworks. His style is truly poetical and vigorous.\r\n\r\nWilliam Sterndale Bennett (1816–75), the most gifted English composer\r\nsince Purcell, should be mentioned here as the friend of Mendelssohn and\r\nSchumann. He profited by their advice and enthusiasm, but his style is\r\nhis own, although undoubtedly influenced by Mendelssohn. His charming\r\novertures, “The Naiads” and “The Wood Nymph,” have a place among\r\nclassical orchestral music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FERDINAND HILLER.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph from life by Eilender, of Cologne.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFerdinand Hiller (1811–85) followed more or less in the footsteps of\r\nMendelssohn, and his works, though finished in form and pleasing, lack\r\nstrong individuality, and, with few exceptions, have remained unfamiliar\r\nexcept to cultivated musicians. His pianoforte concerto in F sharp\r\nminor, and his oratorio “Destruction of Jerusalem” are among his best\r\nworks. Hiller occupied a very influential position as a pianist,\r\nconductor and writer. His extended and intimate acquaintance with most\r\nof the musical celebrities of his time renders his writings of\r\nparticular value. His “Aus dem Tonleben” and “Persönliches und\r\nMusikalisches” are delightful reading and the source of useful\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nJulius Rietz (1812–77) was closely associated with Mendelssohn and\r\ninfluenced by his style. His concert overture in A major, Lustspiel\r\noverture, and Symphony in E flat are his most successful works. His best\r\nreputation rests on his great abilities as an orchestral conductor and\r\nhis technical scholarship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARL REINECKE.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph from life by Brokesch, of Leipsic.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile Rietz was conductor of the Gewandhaus orchestra, from 1848 to\r\n1860, he accomplished the most important work of his life, namely, the\r\ncorrection of errors that had crept into the scores of the great\r\nmasters. In the complete edition of Beethoven’s works, published by\r\nBreitkopf and Härtel, Rietz edited the symphonies. He was also editor of\r\nthe complete edition of Mendelssohn’s works. Carl Reinecke (born 1827),\r\nthe present conductor of the Gewandhaus concerts, stands at the head of\r\nmusical life in Leipsic. As a composer he is to be considered to some\r\nextent as a follower of Schumann. He has been productive in nearly all\r\nforms of composition, and exhibits everywhere thorough practical\r\nexperience and refined musical taste, yet few of his larger works have\r\nwon great prominence. On the other hand, his smaller piano compositions\r\nare highly prized. His overture, “König Manfred,” and his piano concerto\r\nin F sharp minor are favorites.\r\n\r\nWoldemar Bargiel (born 1828) is considered as one of the foremost\r\ndisciples of Schumann. Some of his chamber music and especially his\r\nnoble overture to “Medea” have taken high rank among later compositions.\r\n\r\nAdolph Jensen (1837–79) was an enthusiast for Schumann, and took him as\r\nhis model. He wrote cantatas and piano compositions that are much\r\nadmired, and his songs have made his name famous. Jensen was a born song\r\ncomposer, and his melodies have rare sensuous charm and sentiment.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Robert Volkmann (1815–83) belongs also to the romantic school.\r\nSchumann exercised a great influence on him in his piano works, which\r\nbear fanciful titles.\r\n\r\nHis two symphonies and his string quartets are admired for their solid\r\nstyle, yet this music is not sufficiently spontaneous in melody and\r\nmarked in style to gain universality.\r\n\r\nNorbert Burgmüller (1810–36) and Hermann Goetz (1846–76) were not spared\r\nto fulfil the promise of their gifts. Burgmüller left two symphonies, an\r\noverture, and other compositions which are of decided merit. Schumann\r\ndeclared that since the untimely death of Schubert there was no more\r\ndeplorable event than the loss of Burgmüller.\r\n\r\nGoetz was first made known to the musical world by his opera, “The\r\nTaming of the Shrew,” which achieved a rapid success. He did not live to\r\nfinish his second opera, “Francesca di Rimini,” which was subsequently\r\ncompleted by his friend Frank. His Symphony in F has been played in\r\nEurope and America.\r\n\r\nFranz Lachner (1804–90) was one of the most popular composers of South\r\nGermany. He sprang from a musical family. His father was an organist,\r\nand his brothers Ignaz and Vincenz were prominent musicians. Like so\r\nmany other “Kapellmeister” composers, Lachner has been wonderfully\r\nprolific and facile in all forms of music, without accomplishing\r\nanything truly original or great. His best symphonies are those in C\r\nminor, D minor and D major. His suite in D has been much admired.\r\nKalliwoda, Vierling, Dorn, and Taubert belong to this same class.\r\n\r\nWilhelm Taubert (born 1811) was fellow-student with Mendelssohn under\r\nLudwig Berger. He was a brilliant pianist and well-trained composer. For\r\nmany years he was conductor of the Royal Opera at Berlin. His operas,\r\nsymphonies and other large works have not prominence, but his songs have\r\na pleasing quality that has made them universal favorites.\r\n\r\nMention should be made of Julius Otto Grimm (born 1827), whose ingenious\r\nand effective “Suite in Canon form” has found a place everywhere on\r\nconcert programmes; and Salomon Jadassohn (born 1831), the eminent\r\nmusical theorist of the Leipsic Conservatorium. His treatises on\r\nHarmony, Counterpoint, Fugue, etc., are among the best. His powers as a\r\ncomposer have been displayed in his symphonies, chamber music, etc. His\r\nserenades for orchestra are especial favorites. He shows great facility\r\nin canonic writing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRIEDRICH ROBERT VOLKMANN.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph from life by Keller & Borsos, of Budapest.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong German composers of choral works, during the present century, the\r\nfollowing have been prominent:—\r\n\r\nFriedrich Schneider (1786–1853) was eminent as a teacher and conductor,\r\nand as a composer excelled in the church and oratorio style. His\r\noratorios, “Das Weltgericht” and “The Deluge,” are his best known works.\r\n(Robert Franz was one of his pupils.) Bernhard Klein (1793–1832) was\r\nalso a worthy representative of the sacred style. His oratorio of “Job,”\r\nhis motets and other church compositions are pure and religious in\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nMoritz Hauptmann (1792–1868), one of the most eminent musical theorists\r\nof the nineteenth century, was also a composer of true merit. His\r\nearlier compositions were mainly for the violin, in which he showed his\r\naffinity with Spohr. His vocal works are more important, and include two\r\nmasses, motets, three-part vocal canons, and sacred songs; these works\r\nhold a place among classical church music.\r\n\r\nEduard Grell (1800–86), director of the Berlin Singakademie, was an able\r\nrepresentative of _a capella_ choral music. His sixteen-part mass is a\r\nmasterpiece of polyphonic skill.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Kiel (1821–85) is pre-eminent among recent masters of sacred\r\nmusic for his depth of religious feeling and perfect polyphonic art. His\r\n“Requiem,” “Missa Solemnis” and oratorio, “Christus,” are noble and\r\nprofound works.\r\n\r\nAlbert Becker (born 1834), the well-known Berlin conductor, is the\r\ncomposer of a “Reformation Cantata” and “Mass in B flat minor” which\r\ntake high rank among compositions of their class. Among numberless works\r\nfor male voices, none have been more highly esteemed than those of Carl\r\nFriedrich Zöllner (1800–60) and Heinrich Esser (1818–75). The latter is\r\ndistinguished for his refined and melodious style. His numerous songs\r\nand part songs are universal favorites, and are held in high esteem by\r\ncultivated musicians. His symphonies and suites are also well known.\r\nWagner entrusted Esser with the arrangement of his “Meistersinger” for\r\nthe piano. Esser’s arrangements for orchestra of Bach’s organ\r\n“Passacaglia” and “Toccata in F” are skilfully done.\r\n\r\nThe lighter style of opera has been well represented in Germany, during\r\nthe present century, by Lortzing, Flotow, Von Suppe, Brühl, Johann\r\nStrauss and others.\r\n\r\nAlbert Lortzing (1803–51) is known and loved by all Germans in his\r\noperas, “Die beiden Schützen,” “Czar und Zimmermann,” “Der Wildschütz”\r\nand “Der Waffenschmied.” These are stock pieces in the repertory of\r\nevery German theatre, and never fail to delight audiences. The “Czar und\r\nZimmermann” is a universal favorite. His serious opera, “Undine,” on the\r\ncontrary, is a labored effort in an uncongenial field; but it has\r\nsucceeded in holding its place on the German stage. As a composer of\r\ncomic opera, Lortzing is thoroughly delightful in his naturalness and\r\nstraightforwardness. His opera texts—written by himself—are full of\r\nmovement and variety, and their _naïveté_ is never synonymous with\r\ndulness. His “character” _rôles_ are especially full of possibilities\r\nfor clever actors. Lortzing’s pleasing operas have shed the light of\r\nwholesome and lively entertainment into many millions of lives.\r\n\r\nThe “Nachtlager in Granada,” by Conradin Kreutzer (1782–1849), is\r\nfamiliar enough to all German theatregoers, although its composer has\r\nretained his popularity rather by his songs and male choruses.\r\n\r\nMore famous than Lortzing, though less meritorious, was Friedrich Flotow\r\n(1812–83). Of his fifteen or more operas, “Stradella” and “Martha” are\r\nthe only ones universally known. The artistic aim of Flotow was not\r\nhigh, yet his talent enabled him to make a distinct contribution to the\r\n“light literature” of music. Certain of the melodies of “Stradella” and\r\n“Martha” have more sentiment than is usual with the music of this class.\r\nNevertheless, the popularity of these two operas seems to be on the\r\nwane, and it is possible that Flotow may be known only by name to the\r\nnext generation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRANZ LACHNER.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph from life by Luckhardt, of Vienna.\r\n\r\n  (See page 595.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nOtto Nicolai (1810–49), director of the Domchor and Royal Opera of\r\nBerlin, composed a number of conventional Italian operas and other\r\nworks. His “Merry Wives of Windsor” is one of the most popular comic\r\noperas of the present time. The overture is especially charming, and a\r\ngreat favorite in the concert-room.\r\n\r\nFranz von Suppe (1820–92), “the German Offenbach,” composed an immense\r\nnumber of pleasing operettas and vaudevilles, of which his “Fatinitza”\r\nis celebrated. His overture to the “Poet and Peasant” is one of the most\r\npopular light overtures ever written.\r\n\r\nIgnaz Brüll in his opera “Golden Cross,” and Victor Nessler in his\r\n“Piper of Hamelin” and “Trumpeter of Säkkingen,” have achieved success.\r\nTheir great popularity in Germany is an illustration of the fact that\r\nthe opera public in general have a different standard of taste than\r\ncultivated musicians.\r\n\r\nJohann Strauss (born 1825), the younger, has won great success with his\r\noperettas. His “Fledermaus” and “Der Lustige Krieg” are known all over\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nIn the field of dance music Germany leads the world. The strains of\r\nLanner, Gungl, Waldteufel and Strauss are heard in every land. For\r\npiquancy, sensuous charm of melody, rhythmical swing, thematic contrast\r\nand effective orchestration, the waltzes of Lanner and Strauss are to be\r\nclassed with the most artistic productions of modern Germany.\r\n\r\nSince Schubert’s day, the German Lied-form has been cultivated by many\r\ncomposers, the noblest of whom are Loewe, Schumann, Franz, Rubinstein\r\nand Brahms. Loewe and Franz were specialists, but their songs are very\r\nunlike. In Germany, Loewe has been especially popular with the masses,\r\nwhile Franz, by his exquisite taste and feeling, appeals more strongly\r\nto cultivated musicians. In certain respects Franz and Schumann share\r\nwith Schubert in the fulfilment of the highest ideal of the German Lied.\r\n\r\nCarl Loewe (1796–1869) was a productive composer in various fields of\r\nmusic, but his reputation rests on his merits as a ballad composer.\r\n\r\nThe number of his ballads which have gained universal popularity is very\r\ngreat. Among them may be mentioned “Edward,” “Herr Oluf,” “Abschied,”\r\n“Goldschmieds Töchterlein,” “Der Wirthin Töchterlein,” “Die Braut von\r\nCorinth,” “Heinrich der Vogler,” “Erlkönig,” and “Die Gruft der\r\nLiebenden.” His musical style is remarkable for its dramatic\r\npicturesqueness and justness of declamation. With him everything is made\r\nto contribute to a full rendering of the meaning of the text. His works\r\nhave become very popular, and their popularity is by no means on the\r\nwane. It is remarkable, however, that beyond the boundaries of Germany\r\nhis ballads are but little known.\r\n\r\nThe musical productiveness of modern Germany has been displayed in no\r\nsingle branch so overwhelmingly as in songs. It may truly be said that\r\nevery composer, great and small, has produced his sets of Lieder, though\r\nit has been vouchsafed to only a chosen few to merit distinction in this\r\nover-crowded field. Among the multitude who have composed songs in a\r\nlight style are several whose services to popular music ought not to be\r\nunderestimated. The most prominent of this class are Heinrich Proch\r\n(1809–78), Friedrich Kücken (1810–82), and Franz Abt (1819–85). Of\r\nthese, Abt is the ablest and the most widely known. Most of his songs\r\nare trivial in character, but a few, like “When the Swallows Homeward\r\nFly,” have touched the popular heart and deserve their widespread fame.\r\n\r\nThe preceding brief account of the minor composers of Germany, belonging\r\nto the “classical” and “romantic” periods, may serve to show that in art\r\nas well as nature the “survival of the fittest” seems to be the\r\ngoverning principle of evolution. Comparatively few works of musical art\r\nare monumental, and survive the changes of fashion, the inconstancy of\r\nthe public, and the ravages of time. Among the crowd of masters who are\r\ngrouped around the central figures are some who merit a better fate than\r\nhas befallen them. Some day, no doubt, their now forgotten works will be\r\nrevived, just as those of neglected poets and painters have been. Surely\r\nfame is to some extent the accident of fortune. The case of Sebastian\r\nBach is the most striking illustration. Of the majority of imitators or\r\nepigones, however, it may briefly be written, as the abstract of the\r\nhistorian’s page,—they lived—and died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SALOMON JADASSOHN.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph from life by Naumann, of Leipsic.\r\n\r\n  (See page 595.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the more recent and widely celebrated composers, Raff,\r\nBrahms, Rubinstein, Goldmark, Bruch and Rheinberger, who form the\r\nsubject of special articles in this work. These masters are not to be\r\nclassed with the new movement inaugurated by Berlioz and Liszt in\r\nconcert music and by Wagner in the music-drama, but with the\r\n“classical-romantic” masters. Raff, it is true, wrote “program” music,\r\nbut he differs from Berlioz and Liszt in holding almost strictly to the\r\nregular construction of the symphonic form. Though Raff, in his earlier\r\ndays, was a warm advocate of the ideas of Wagner, his own music bears\r\nlittle relation to the great works of the musical dramatist. Raff has a\r\nstyle of his own. He never repeated himself, notwithstanding the\r\nenormous amount of music he composed. This fertility of ideas was in\r\nfact a source of weakness, since it rendered him careless in the choice\r\nof themes, and blunted his feeling for what was truly refined and\r\nelevated. He often failed to keep to the high level of the true\r\nsymphonic spirit and style. His “salon” style crops out here and there.\r\nThe “Lenore” and “Im Walde” symphonies are his most celebrated works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MORITZ HAUPTMANN.\r\n\r\n  From a portrait loaned for reproduction by C. Weikert, of New York.\r\n\r\n  (See page 595.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nNo living German composer represents the tragic and intellectual side of\r\nmodern subjective music so impressively as Brahms. The strong outlines\r\nof his character are impressed on all his music. He is entirely opposed\r\nto the so-called “new German school” of Liszt and Wagner, and adheres\r\nstrictly to the classical forms. No comparison, however, ought to be\r\nmade between him and Wagner, as Brahms has never turned his attention to\r\ndramatic music. Brahms defends his own art-principles on the ground of\r\nabsolute music. His love for the strict, logical process of thematic\r\ndevelopment proves his affinity with Bach. The leading theme is the germ\r\nof the whole movement; and notwithstanding the episodes and secondary\r\nthemes, he is not usually drawn away from the main idea. Brahms has no\r\nliving peer in the art of developing themes; here he shows wonderful\r\ningenuity and infinite skill. In general, however, his themes do not\r\ncaptivate us like the heaven-born melodies of Schubert and Schumann.\r\nStrength, purity, nobility and profundity of thought, rather than\r\nsensuous beauty, grace, lightness, naturalness and spontaneousness, are\r\nhis leading characteristics as a composer. A certain heaviness of spirit\r\nand gloom, nay, asceticism, prevail in his music. He appears at his best\r\nin his “German Requiem,” which many musicians consider to be his\r\ngreatest work. His symphonies and other instrumental compositions occupy\r\nthe foreground at present. Although musicians are still divided in\r\nopinion as to the ultimate position of Brahms among the great masters,\r\nno one can deny that his music is gaining public appreciation year by\r\nyear. He is universally recognized as the foremost living composer of\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe so-called “musical reform,” inaugurated in Germany more than a\r\ngeneration ago, was not incited by Germans, but by the adopted\r\ncomposers, Berlioz and Liszt. Their aim was simply to make poetical\r\nideas the motive and governing principle of the form and material of\r\ntheir tone-works. The idea of “program” music, however, was not original\r\nwith them; in fact, it is centuries old. Beethoven was the first great\r\nmaster to write elaborate program music; but his “Pastoral Symphony”\r\nwas, in his own words, “more expression of emotions than tone-painting.”\r\nIn this short statement of his faith he has clearly defined the true\r\nscope of descriptive music. He gave poetic titles to certain other\r\nworks, as, for instance, the “Heroic Symphony,” the “Passionate” and\r\n“Farewell” sonatas, which serve to indicate in a general way the\r\npoetical motive that swayed his imagination. Spohr, Mendelssohn,\r\nSchumann, Raff, Rubinstein and other later composers have followed\r\nBeethoven’s example. Most of the program music of these masters does not\r\nmodify the traditional form of musical construction. Berlioz went much\r\nfurther, and conceived the idea of using elaborate word descriptions to\r\ngive a detailed and minute exposition of his pseudo-symphonies. Berlioz\r\nshot beyond his mark. Berlioz made his program serve as a kind of\r\nrunning commentary on the music. Liszt did not attempt this; his aim was\r\na simpler and a better one. Symphonic Poem is the happy name for an\r\noriginal form which he created in orchestral music. Some character or\r\nevent was chosen as a poetical motive easily realizable in music; as,\r\nfor instance, the Lament and Triumph of Tasso, in which the passion and\r\nstruggle of the great poet are vividly portrayed, or the wild ride of\r\nMazeppa, which, as in Victor Hugo’s poem, has a symbolical meaning.\r\nMazeppa represents the gifted man, or genius, tied down by fate, but\r\ndestined to free himself and ultimately to triumph over evil. The\r\ngalloping horse is suggested by wild triplets, and the final triumph is\r\nexpressed in the march with which the work culminates.\r\n\r\nThe symphonic poems of Liszt, and those who follow strictly his example,\r\nare not divided into a number of distinct, separate movements like the\r\nsymphony, but the changes of tempo or movement follow each other without\r\nbreak. Liszt made a prominent use of the Leitmotiv (leading-motive)\r\nprinciple, which he adopted from Wagner. It will be observed that the\r\nresult, however, is wholly different, for Wagner in the course of one of\r\nhis music-dramas uses a variety of dissimilar and strongly contrasted\r\nleading motives. His music, therefore, is based on the _polythematic_\r\nprinciple, whereas the symphonic poems of Liszt are generally\r\n_monothematic_. The leading-motive is one thing in connection with the\r\ndrama, another as employed in the concert-room. In the latter case it\r\nserves the same purpose that it has in the fugues of Bach (mostly\r\nfounded on one theme) or in certain movements of symphonies. It is\r\nsimply the working up on the imitative principle of a leading idea,\r\nwhich is modified, enlarged, curtailed and varied according to the\r\nconditions of counterpoint, harmony, rhythm, etc. So far as thematic\r\nimitation is concerned, the symphonic poem is an offshoot of the\r\nsymphony or overture. What the symphonic poem has gained in conciseness\r\nof form it has lost in grandeur and impressiveness. The symphonic poem\r\nrelates to the symphony as a noble and beautiful church does to a grand,\r\nawe-inspiring cathedral. In treating his grandest subjects—“The Divine\r\nComedy” of Dante, and “Faust” of Goethe—Liszt returned to the general\r\noutlines of the symphony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ALBERT LORTZING\r\n\r\n  (See page 595.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe symphonic poem is a welcome addition to modern music, but it is\r\ncapable of further development both in form and character. There is no\r\nreason why the polythematic principle should not be applied to it, or\r\nwhy the movements should not be extended. In the future the symphonic\r\npoem may rival the symphony, but is not likely to supplant it. The\r\nsymphony has undergone many changes of detail since Beethoven, and in\r\nthe course of time it is probable that new forms of instrumental music\r\nwill be invented, but it will be difficult to reach as high an ideal as\r\nthat attained by the great masters of the symphony. In grandeur,\r\nemotional intensity, thematic variety, contrast of movements, the\r\nsymphonies of Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Brahms and others stand on\r\na higher plane than the symphonic poems of Liszt, Saint-Saëns and many\r\nless conspicuous composers who have cultivated this form.\r\n\r\nIt would much exceed the narrow limits set by this article to attempt to\r\ndiscuss the far-reaching questions connected with the great musical and\r\ndramatic reform of Wagner. This forms the subject of an able special\r\narticle, to which the reader is referred. Wagner’s world-wide influence\r\nhas not been confined to the dramatic stage. His bold independence of\r\nthought and creative originality served to break down the barriers of\r\nformalism and conservatism, which held back German music after the death\r\nof Mendelssohn and Schumann. The Napoleon of music cleared the way, not\r\nonly for himself, but other young composers who were struggling for\r\nrecognition. Since his death no German has yet appeared able to follow\r\nin his footsteps, or to strike out a path for himself in dramatic music.\r\nAt the same time all serious dramatic composers, Italian, French, etc.,\r\nof the present day, have consciously or unconsciously been affected by\r\nWagner’s musico-dramatic ideas.\r\n\r\nAmong all the German composers who have gathered inspiration from the\r\ntheories and music of Wagner, only a single one seems to have produced a\r\nmusical drama which bears the stamp of real genius and clearly defined\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRIEDRICH von FLOTOW.\r\n\r\n  From a steel portrait engraved from a photograph by Weger, of Leipsic.\r\n\r\n  (See page 596.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nPeter Cornelius (1824–74) first became prominent at the time when Liszt\r\nat Weimar was doing so much for the advancement of the so-called “new\r\nGerman school of composition.” Cornelius at once identified himself with\r\nthis modern movement. It was on account of the indifference of the court\r\nand the public toward Cornelius’s “The Barber of Bagdad” that Liszt gave\r\nup his directorship of the theatre at Weimar in 1858. In the same year,\r\nCornelius’s opera, “The Cid,” was produced at Weimar. The completion of\r\na third opera, “Gunlöd,” was prevented by his death, which occurred at\r\nMayence in 1874.\r\n\r\nHis comic opera, “The Barber of Bagdad,” gives Cornelius a unique\r\nposition among the composers of the new German school. This seems to be\r\nthe only work of genius which has been produced in Germany as a result\r\nof the Wagnerian cult; and it remains the single but the sufficient\r\nground for a denial of the charge made by disbelievers, that the\r\ntheories of Wagner can lead to nothing beautiful and good in opera. The\r\nopera-poem is by Cornelius himself, and is a marvel of bubbling humor\r\nand literary ingenuity; and the music is of exceeding complexity and\r\nintensely difficult to render. The methods of treatment are distinctly\r\nWagnerian, but there is not a suggestion of Wagner in the character of\r\nthe melodies or in the instrumentation. All is delightful and\r\nindividual, in short, the work of a genius. On the other hand, in the\r\n“Cid,” a tragic opera founded on Herder’s poem, Cornelius was not so\r\nsuccessful. It is certain that “The Barber” will ultimately be\r\nappreciated; for its sparkling wit and delightful music are\r\nirresistible, matched only among German composers by the “Figaro” of\r\nMozart.\r\n\r\nCornelius was far from being a Wagner, but he has done one thing which\r\nWagner probably could not have done: he has written an opera libretto\r\nwhich is considered superlatively witty and entertaining by other people\r\nthan Germans, and set it to music which is noble, charming and\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\nAnton Bruckner has also been prominently identified with the new German\r\nschool. In his heavy and massive instrumentation and style of writing he\r\nis pronouncedly Wagnerian, but he has not endeared himself to the lovers\r\nof sweet sounds.\r\n\r\nAnother prominent disciple of Liszt and Wagner is Felix Draeseke, born\r\n1835, who became enthusiastic for the new school, and contributed to the\r\nliterature devoted to the propagation of the ideas of Berlioz, Liszt and\r\nWagner. He was one of the few who were openly praised by Wagner. His\r\nnumerous compositions consist of symphonies, chamber music, songs and\r\npiano pieces. Draeseke has written two operas, “Herrat” and “Gundrun,”\r\nthe latter of which has been performed with success. Among his latest\r\norchestral productions are two symphonic preludes to dramas by Calderon\r\nand Kleist.\r\n\r\nJean Louis Nicodé (born 1853) is another staunch believer in the new\r\ntendencies in modern music. His compositions for orchestra include\r\n“Symphonic Variations,” the symphonic poem, “Maria Stuart,” Suite in B\r\nminor, Introduction and Scherzo. He has written piano and chamber music,\r\nand several large choral works. His “Symphonic Variations” are\r\nespecially admired. Nicodé manifests the most astounding technique in\r\ncomposition, and delights in producing startling orchestral effects.\r\n\r\nEdward Lassen (born 1830), though a Dane by birth, has been identified\r\nwith music in Germany for the greater part of his life. He was first\r\nmade known as a composer through the kind offices of Liszt, who produced\r\non the Weimar stage Lassen’s “Le Roi Edgard,” “Frauenlob,” and “Der\r\nGefangene.” These operas met with a decided success. Lassen succeeded\r\nLiszt as chief director of the Weimar opera, and still holds that\r\nposition. His published works include the music to Hebbel’s\r\n“Nibelungen,” Sophocles’ “Œdipus,” Calderon’s “Circe,” and Goethe’s\r\n“Faust” and “Pandora,” “Fest Cantate,” “Te Deum,” and several\r\nsymphonies. During the last few years he has occupied himself\r\nprincipally with the composition of songs, which are much admired. His\r\nlatest work of importance is his violin concerto.\r\n\r\nAnother worthy representative of the new German music is Alexander\r\nRitter, the composer of numerous vocal works, including operas. There is\r\nno doubt concerning the seriousness of his artistic endeavors, nor of\r\nhis great abilities; but, as with Nicodé, he has large utterance, and\r\nbut little of real importance to say.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRANZ von SUPPE.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph from life by Luckhardt, of Vienna.\r\n\r\n  (See page 596.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nBy far the most interesting and the most promising of this class of\r\nmodern composers is Richard Strauss. He is not related to the Vienna\r\nStrauss family. Young Strauss is now Lassen’s assistant director at the\r\nWeimar theatre, and has shown remarkable ability both as an opera and\r\nconcert conductor. Although not yet thirty years old, he has produced a\r\nconsiderable number of large works and numerous smaller ones. His\r\nearlier efforts show the influence of Brahms, but for the last few years\r\nhe has adopted the Wagner-Liszt manner. Three symphonic poems, “Death\r\nand Redemption,” “Macbeth” and “Don Juan,” as well as a symphonic\r\nfantasia, “In Italy,” have been greatly admired. Evidently this young\r\ncomposer has a more promising future than any of his young\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nFelix Weingartner, the talented conductor of the Royal Opera of Berlin,\r\nis a young composer of promise. Besides numerous songs and a serenade\r\nfor string orchestra, he has written two operas. The second of these,\r\n“Genesius,” was produced in Berlin in November, 1892, but, as might have\r\nbeen expected, it was not warmly received by the public. Weingartner,\r\nlike Strauss, is extremely modern in his musical tendencies, and his\r\nworks, although interesting to connoisseurs and lauded by certain\r\ncritics, will not at once find public recognition.\r\n\r\nIt would far exceed the limits of this article to give a complete\r\naccount of pianoforte playing and composition in Germany since\r\nBeethoven’s time. The influence of the piano on modern music has been\r\ngreater than that of any other single instrument. It is not only the\r\nfavorite of the amateur, but is _par excellence_ the composer’s\r\ninstrument. As almost every modern German composer has written for the\r\npiano, its literature is far more voluminous than that of any other\r\ninstrument, and piano players are as countless as the sands of the sea.\r\n\r\nModern representatives of piano style may be classed as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Composers with whom technical execution is held subordinate to\r\nmusical thought and feeling, perfect form, and poetic beauty. Beethoven,\r\nSchubert, Von Weber, Mendelssohn, Schumann, represent this class. 2.\r\nPiano specialists who have brought manual execution into the foreground\r\nand have carried it to an extreme, chiefly for its own sake; as for\r\nexample, Kalkbrenner, Herz, Henselt, Döhler, Thalberg, Dreyschock,\r\nLitolff and Liszt in the earlier period of his career. 3. Remarkable\r\nteachers of technique and style, like Czerny, Moscheles, Kullak and\r\nWieck. 4. Virtuosos who unite great technique with remarkable powers of\r\ninterpretation, like Tausig, Von Bülow and others. 5. Composers who are\r\nlikewise great virtuosos and interpreters, like Liszt and Rubinstein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRANZ ABT.\r\n\r\n  (See page 597.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nBetween 1830 and 1840 piano virtuosity as regards mere technical\r\nexecution was at its height. Kalkbrenner, Herz, and other “finger\r\nknights” created furore everywhere by their pyrotechnic feats. This was\r\nthe era of the “opera fantasia.” Let us be thankful that audiences\r\nnowadays demand a different kind of musical pabulum. Thalberg (1812–71)\r\nmarks the highest attainment of this style. He was pre-eminent for his\r\nfinished execution and rich singing quality of tone. His scales,\r\noctaves, arpeggios, trills, and every detail of technique were of\r\nmarvellous perfection. His style influenced a number of pianists, as for\r\nexample, Leopold de Meyer, Goria, Döhler, Willmers and Prudent.\r\n\r\nUnder Thalberg, Liszt, Tausig, Rubinstein, Paderewski, etc., piano\r\nvirtuosity has reached its apex. Mr. Ernst Pauer, the noted pianist and\r\neditor of “Alte Clavier Musik,” justly observes: “With regard to\r\nrapidity, force, ingenuity of combinations, and dazzling effect, it is\r\nnot too much to assert that the highest point has been gained, and that\r\nwith respect to _quantity_ of notes and effects our present players are\r\nunrivalled; whether the _quality_ is as good as it formerly was may be\r\nquestioned.”\r\n\r\nThe world-wide influence of Chopin and Liszt on piano style is discussed\r\nin special articles of this work.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Bach and Handel the organ was the foremost instrument as\r\nthe exponent of musical ideas even more than the pianoforte is during\r\nthe present century. To-day it has its own high place in the temple of\r\nart, and counts among its devotees artists of great repute and dignity.\r\nDuring the present century German organists have followed the school of\r\nSebastian Bach, of whom the most prominent are Rink, Johann Schneider,\r\nHesse, Fischer, Thiele, Haupt, Ritter, Becker, Merkel, Herzog, Faisst\r\nand Rheinberger. August Haupt and Johann Schneider were remarkable\r\ninterpreters of Bach’s organ works. The former was also a rare teacher,\r\nbeloved and venerated by his American and German pupils. The most\r\nimportant organ compositions of modern German masters are the difficult\r\nand massive concert pieces of Thiele, and the noble sonatas, etc., of\r\nMendelssohn, Schumann, Ritter, Merkel and Rheinberger.\r\n\r\nIn solo violin playing Germany at first followed the lead of Italy.\r\nMention has been made of the most noted German violinists of the last\r\ncentury. About the beginning of the present century Paris was the centre\r\nof violin playing under Viotti, Rode, Kreutzer and Baillot. These\r\nmasters laid down the principles of violin playing as practised to-day.\r\nThey were followed by Alard, the modern French teacher, and the\r\nso-called Belgian school of De Beriot, Vieuxtemps, Wieniawski and\r\nothers. As regards finish, brilliancy of style, and purity of tone these\r\nFranco-Belgian masters have had a strong influence on Germany. In violin\r\nplaying Spohr is considered as the direct heir of Rode and Viotti. The\r\ncontemporaries of Spohr in Germany were Schuppanzigh, Mayseder, Maurer,\r\nMolique, Lipinski and others, all of whom contributed to violin\r\nliterature. Spohr’s most distinguished pupil was Ferdinand David\r\n(1810–73). He was eclectic and many-sided in his taste and knowledge. As\r\nregards technique and style he set high value on the French masters of\r\nthe violin. He was the first to play Bach’s difficult violin solos in\r\npublic. Among his numerous pupils was the famous virtuoso, Wilhelmj, who\r\nis unsurpassed for his wonderful tone and execution. Joachim also\r\nbenefited by David’s advice.\r\n\r\nThe violin school, of Vienna, founded by Joseph Boehm (1798–1876), has\r\nhad a wide influence in training virtuosos. Ernst, G. Helmesberger,\r\nLudwig Strauss, Joachim, J. Helmesberger, Auer and Neruda were trained\r\nin this school. Pupils of Pixis at Prague were the renowned violinists\r\nKalliwoda and Ferdinand Laub (1832–74). The latter was a wonderful\r\nquartet player, and stood in the front rank as a virtuoso.\r\n\r\nJoseph Joachim (born 1831) is the most eminent of living violinists. He\r\nhas had the widest influence of any violin master as an interpreter of\r\nthe great masters. Perfect technique, a rich and full tone, purity and\r\nelevation of style, and fidelity of interpretation are the leading\r\ncharacteristics of Joachim as a violinist. It may be said of Joachim, as\r\nof Liszt, that he not only interprets but _recreates_ the music of the\r\ngreat masters. He is equally great as a quartet player and as a soloist.\r\nJoachim’s compositions are chiefly for the violin. His style is grave\r\nand earnest, and suggestive of Schumann. His most important work is the\r\n“Hungarian Concerto,” which has noble characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe most noted masters of the violoncello are Bernhard Romberg\r\n(1767–1841), Kummer (1797–1879), and his successor in the Dresden\r\norchestra, Grützmacher (born 1832), and the virtuoso composers, Popper,\r\nDavidoff and De Swert.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PETER CORNELIUS.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph by Albert, of Munich.\r\n\r\n  (See page 600.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong the many fine solo players on wind instruments were the renowned\r\nclarinetists, Joseph Baermann (1784–1847) and his son Carl (1811–1885).\r\nVon Weber was intimately associated with the elder Baermann, and wrote\r\nfor him the fine clarinet concertos and concert pieces which have become\r\nclassical. The high artistic character and ability of this family of\r\nmusicians is exemplified in the person of the thorough musician and\r\ngifted pianist, Carl Baermann, Junior. He was formerly professor at the\r\nMunich Royal Conservatory, and is now a resident of Boston, where he\r\nexerts a noble influence as concert pianist and teacher. Germany has not\r\nproduced so many singers of world-wide fame as composers or virtuosos,\r\nyet during the last half-century, and especially in connection with the\r\nWagnerian drama, the number of celebrated singers has increased. As\r\ndramatic artists these German singers are surpassed by none, though in\r\npure vocalism they may not rank as high as those of the Italian and\r\nFrench school. Among the most renowned are Sontag, Milder, Tichatschek,\r\nPauline Lucca, Gerster, Unger, Wachtel, Formes, Stockhausen, Staudigl,\r\nHenschel, Wranitzky, Loewe and Schröder-Devrient (1804–60). This\r\nlast-named singer was one of the most highly gifted artists who ever\r\nappeared on the operatic stage. She created the part of Leonore in\r\nBeethoven’s “Fidelio.” In later years she appeared in Wagner’s earlier\r\noperas, and was of great assistance to him in realizing his ideal of\r\ndramatic singing. In his writings Wagner eulogizes her. The musical\r\ndramas of Wagner have not only been the high school for orchestral\r\nvirtuosos and conductors, but above all for dramatic singers. The most\r\nfamous German singers of the present day have been associated with\r\nBayreuth and the established opera houses of Germany where Wagner’s\r\nworks are performed. The most noteworthy of these Wagner singers are\r\nFrau Materna, Marianne Brandt, Malten, Lehmann-Kalisch, Mallinger,\r\nDietz, Kindermann, Ludwig, Schnorr von Carolsfeld, to whom Wagner pays\r\nsuch a tribute of praise in the eighth volume of his collected writings;\r\nWinkelmann, Vogl, Gura, Niemann, Scheidemantel, Van Dyck, Alvary, Betz,\r\nScaria and Emil Fischer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD STRAUSS.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph from life by Hanfstaengl, of Munich.\r\n\r\n  (See page 601.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne of the results of Germany’s high development in music, and\r\nconsequent “division of labor” in the executive part of the art, has\r\nbeen to give great importance to the conductors of orchestras and of\r\nlarge musical societies. Until recently there have been but few cases of\r\nreally great conductors who were not at the same time prominent\r\ncomposers. Weber, Wagner, Spohr, Mendelssohn, Marschner, Lindpaintner,\r\nRietz and Hiller were all Kapellmeister-composers. The remarkable\r\nadvance in orchestral technique and the increased work demanded of\r\nconductors have given rise to the necessity of training men exclusively\r\nfor this exacting profession. There are at present in Germany a\r\nhalf-dozen specialists in this branch who are particularly\r\ndistinguished. Foremost among them is the gifted Hans von Bülow (born\r\n1830). Great as are this master’s merits as a piano virtuoso, it is\r\nchiefly as a conductor that he has had important influence upon the\r\nmusical activity of his time. His long connection with the Meiningen\r\norchestra, at a period when it made frequent concert tours through\r\nGermany, was of great service in raising the standard of orchestral\r\ninterpretation throughout the country.\r\n\r\nHans Richter (born 1843) also enjoys an international reputation as a\r\nconductor. He is chief conductor of the Imperial opera and Philharmonic\r\nconcerts of Vienna. He has also frequently conducted the concerts of the\r\nLondon Philharmonic Society. Richter was intimately associated with\r\nWagner, and directed the first Bayreuth performance in 1876.\r\n\r\nA conductor of perhaps even greater ability, but of less extended\r\nreputation, is Hermann Levi (born 1839), the chief conductor of the\r\nMunich theatre. He also was intimately associated with Wagner, and\r\nconducted the first performance of “Parsifal” at Bayreuth in 1882. He is\r\nat present the conductor-in-chief at Bayreuth. His principal claim to\r\nsuperiority lies in the fact that he conducts equally well the daintiest\r\nHaydn symphony and the most complex Wagner music-drama. He is as a\r\nconductor what Liszt was as a pianist, universally sympathetic in his\r\ninterpretations.\r\n\r\nFelix Mottl (born 1856) of Carlsruhe, and Ernst Schuch (born 1848) of\r\nDresden, are worthy to be grouped with Germany’s great conductors. The\r\nformer is one of the Bayreuth conductors. The young composers, Strauss\r\nand Weingartner, are also able Kapellmeister.\r\n\r\nAny consideration of the history of music in Germany would be incomplete\r\nwithout some mention of her great achievements in musical criticism,\r\nhistory, theory, philosophy and æsthetics. In these departments of\r\nliterary and scientific work, Germany has accomplished infinitely more\r\nthan any other nation. We have already had occasion, in speaking of\r\ncertain composers, to mention their literary works. But the majority of\r\nwriters on music have left no record as artists.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century the most noted German writers on musical\r\nhistory and criticism were Forkel, Gerbert, Mattheson, Scheibe,\r\nReichardt and J. A. Hiller; on musical theory and instruction, Fux,\r\nAlbrechtsberger, Marpurg, Kirnberger, Sorge, Knecht, Quantz, Em. Bach\r\nand Leopold Mozart. During the present century the principal writers on\r\nthe general subject of musical history have been Brendel, von Dommer,\r\nReissmann, Naumann, Langhans and August Wilhelm Ambros (1816–76). For\r\noriginal research, profound learning, and remarkable critical insight\r\nthe “Geschichte der Musik” by Ambros ranks first among all works on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nR. G. Kiesewetter (1773–1850), the uncle of Ambros, shows equal\r\nthoroughness in treating the special subjects of musical history. His\r\nmonographs on the Netherland masters, on secular song, on Arabian music,\r\netc., are sources of important information. Carl von Winterfeld is the\r\ngreat authority on German church music. His “Der Evangelische\r\nKirchengesang” is a work of great learning.\r\n\r\nIn the field of musical biography the list is a long one, and includes\r\nMarx, Schindler, Nohl, Nottebohm, Lenz, Bitter, Chrysander, Jahn and\r\nSpitta.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HANS von BÜLOW.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph from life by Bieber, of Hamburg.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOtto Jahn’s “Life of Mozart,” and Philipp Spitta’s “Life of Bach,” are\r\nmasterly biographies, which are an honor to the authors and the nation\r\nthat produced them. They are monuments of exhaustive research and\r\nprofound critical analysis. Mention should be made of the biography of\r\nBeethoven by Alexander W. Thayer, which was published in Germany as the\r\nfruits of many years of patient and thorough investigation. The author\r\nis an American by birth and education, but has long been identified with\r\nGerman musical literature, and is considered as the authority in all\r\nthat pertains to the life of the great composer.\r\n\r\nMusical criticism has been well represented by Friedrich Rochlitz\r\n(1770–1808), the founder of the “Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung” of\r\nLeipsic; Adolf Bernhard Marx (1799–1866), one of the most broadly\r\neducated musical writers of his time; Gottfried Weber (1779–1839),\r\neditor of the musical periodical, “Cæcilia”; Thibaut, whose “Purity in\r\nMusical Art” is a highly esteemed essay; Schumann, the composer, who\r\ngave a new and higher direction to musical criticism in his “Neue\r\nZeitschrift für Musik.” Schumann’s gifted poetical nature is revealed in\r\nhis critical reviews as well as in his music, and he set an example\r\nfollowed by others, though at a distance, among whom Eduard Hanslick, of\r\nVienna, is perhaps the most worthy of mention; Wilhelm Tappert, the\r\neditor of the “Allgemeine Deutsche Zeitung,” is a zealous partisan of\r\nWagner. His “Wagner Lexicon” is a curious compilation of all the slang\r\nand abuse that have been hurled at the composer and his friends.\r\n\r\nAmong the imaginative writers on musical subjects, the most remarkable\r\nwas Ernst T. R. Hoffmann, whose romantic tales have given him a\r\nprominent place in German literature. He was composer, poet, singer,\r\nteacher, conductor and theatrical manager; he was especially gifted as\r\nan improvisator. Everything this eccentric genius did, he did well.\r\nAmong his works are eleven operas and two symphonies. Schumann was much\r\ninfluenced by the fantastic tales of Hoffmann. His “Kreisleriana” was\r\nsuggested by Hoffmann’s fragments of the imaginary “Kreisler the\r\nKapellmeister.” Beethoven wrote a humorous canon addressed to Hoffmann,\r\nand Weber loved him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VIENNA OPERA HOUSE\r\n\r\n  From a photograph.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGermany, during the present century, has produced almost endless works\r\non musical theory and speculation. The most prominent representatives\r\nare G. Weber; Hauptmann, whose “Harmony and Metre” is a profound work;\r\nMarx and Lobe, whose general systems treat of all branches of musical\r\ncomposition, including instrumentation, and are valuable as books of\r\nreference; E. F. Richter and Jadassohn, whose treatises on harmony,\r\ncounterpoint and fugue are excellent text-books. Other well-known\r\ntheoretical writers are Weitzmann, Paul, Sechter, Riemann, Friedrich and\r\nHeinrich Bellermann and Westphal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE CONCERT HALL IN THE GEWANDHAUS IN LEIPSIC.\r\n\r\n  From an engraving published about 1860.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe æsthetics of music have been extensively treated by the foremost\r\nGerman philosophers. Hegel and his followers Vischer and Kahlert, laid\r\nthe foundation of a comprehensive consideration of the subject. The\r\nphilosophers outside the Hegelian school, Krüger, Schelling, Krause,\r\nCarriere, Karl Köstlin, Fechner, Wundt and Lötze, have included in\r\nlarger works more or less extensive treatments of musical æsthetics, and\r\nthe interest which Wagner felt for the theories of Schopenhauer is well\r\nknown. In addition to these, several writers—Schubart, Hand, Schilling,\r\nHeinrich Köstlin, Reissmann, Riemann, Kullak, Stumpf, Engel—have written\r\nlarge treatises devoted exclusively to the subject. The object has been\r\nto establish, if possible, the psychological relations of music, and to\r\ndeduce the _raison d’être_ of the various musical forms; but no one has\r\nyet established conclusions which have been generally accepted. Opposed\r\nto these writers are a small number of advocates of a purely formalistic\r\ntheory of music,—Herbart, Zimmermann and Hanslick. The last-named is the\r\nauthor of a book entitled “Concerning the Musically Beautiful,” which\r\nhas been perhaps more generally read and commented upon than any other\r\nsingle work on musical æsthetics. It is safe to assert that this work of\r\nHanslick does not solve the mystery of the power of music on the soul.\r\nCertainly it seems to be a superficial idea of Hanslick that music has\r\nno inward meaning (or Inhalt), and is only a mere play of form\r\n(Formspiel). But this interesting little book is so brilliantly written\r\nand so carefully considered that it still holds its own, and is known\r\nthroughout the musical world.\r\n\r\nIn this connection mention should be made of “The Sensations of Tone,”\r\npublished in 1863 by Hermann Helmholtz, the great Berlin physicist. This\r\nwork is not only one of the greatest achievements of German science, but\r\nis also unique among all works published on the subject of music. It\r\nembodies the results of exhaustive research into all phenomena connected\r\nwith the production of tone and its perception by the human\r\nconsciousness. In a word, it establishes a firm physical foundation for\r\nall future philosophical speculations concerning music.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly and truly said that the time is not yet ripe for an\r\nexhaustive history of music. An enormous amount of material, it is true,\r\nhas been collected, but in most divisions of the subject the sources of\r\ninformation have not yet been thoroughly explored. At present Germany is\r\ndistancing all other nations in the contributions made to the sum of\r\nhistorical knowledge concerning music. Not to mention the numberless\r\ntreatises and monographs which are continually appearing, the regularly\r\npublished musical periodicals are numerous and excellent, and frequently\r\nmake important contributions to musical scholarship.\r\n\r\nAlthough the present article is far from professing to present a\r\ncomplete account of all that Germany has accomplished in music, it may\r\nserve to show the many-sided character of musical culture in that land.\r\nNot one of the many branches of musical activity has failed to feel the\r\ninfluence of Germany, and in only a few branches does she hold any other\r\nthan the leading position. In our own day her musical zeal remains\r\nunabated. The number of musical compositions and books published year by\r\nyear in Germany is enormous, and the proportion of her young men who\r\nenter on the career of teacher or performer seems to be increasing\r\nrather than diminishing. While it is true that there are very few great\r\ncomposers now living in Germany, and that they are rivalled by the\r\nliving composers of other nationalities, and even though in the latest\r\nmusic of over-cultivated Germany there is a want of freshness,\r\nnaturalness and _naïveté_ that belong only to musical youth, yet there\r\nis no reason for supposing that any other nation will, in the near\r\nfuture, usurp Germany’s well-merited title of “laureate amongst all\r\nmusical nations.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John K.

Several of\r\nhis biographers assure us that he was of noble birth, supporting their\r\nstatements by the letters of naturalization granted him by Louis XIV.,\r\nin December, 1661, in which the composer is called the son of Laurent\r\nLully, a man of quality, and Catherine del Sarte. It is, however, more\r\nprobable that he was the offspring of an obscure country miller who\r\ndwelt near Florence, as stated by Guichard in a celebrated memoir which\r\nhe drew up at the time of his lawsuit for dissolution of partnership\r\nwith Lully, who had co-operated with him in the management of the Opéra.\r\n\r\nBy chance it came to pass that the Chevalier de Guise, when travelling\r\nin Italy, discovered young Baptiste Lully in Florence, his native place.\r\nThe nobleman was impressed by the precocious intelligence that sparkled\r\nso brightly in the boy’s eyes. He who was destined to become the founder\r\nof lyric tragedy in France was singing popular songs, accompanying\r\nhimself upon the guitar, from instinct rather than training, for he had\r\nnever been taught to play that instrument, and possessed, as yet, only\r\nthe most primitive ideas regarding music. He was then about twelve years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nAt that time, people were not very musical in France, Italy being much\r\nmore advanced in that respect. In the era of Le Grande Monarque, “Le Roi\r\nSoleil,” there were neither orchestras nor singers in the true sense of\r\nthe words, and opera was, so to speak, quite unknown.\r\n\r\nThe first musical play ever seen in France was produced on the occasion\r\nof the marriage of Mlle. de Vaudemont, Marguerite de Lorraine,\r\nsister-in-law of King Henri III., to the Duc de Joyeuse. It was\r\nperformed on the 15th of October, 1579, at the Château de Moustier, in\r\npresence of ten thousand spectators, and the Italian, Baltazarini,\r\nfulfilled the duties of impressario. He was ever afterwards known by the\r\nname of Baltazar de Beaujoyeuse, and in this way the Duc de Joyeuse may\r\nbe said to have ennobled him.\r\n\r\nThis Italian had been brought to France by the Comte de Brissac, and\r\nCatherine de Médicis appointed him musical director, with the dignity of\r\nvalet, to her court. He played the violin after the manner of a\r\nvirtuoso—for his time. It was this same Baltazarini who composed the\r\ndance music in the opera-ballet “Cérès,” of which Claudin wrote the\r\nvocal score.\r\n\r\nCardinal Mazarin was fond of musical plays, and in 1644 he caused to be\r\nbrought from Italy dramatic singers who, in the hall of the\r\nPetit-Bourbon and in presence of the king, Louis XIV., gave a\r\nrepresentation of the “Festa della finta pazza,” a melodrama in five\r\nacts interspersed with comic interludes. Two years later, the Abbé\r\nMailly organized a representation of a lyric tragedy entitled “Akebar,\r\nRoi du Mogol,” which was given in one of the halls of the episcopal\r\npalace of Carpentras.\r\n\r\nThe taste for music was gradually extending in the ranks of cultivated\r\nFrench society, and Mlle. de Montpensier had asked the Chevalier de\r\nGuise to bring for her from Italy—the cradle of opera—“a young musician\r\nto enliven my house.”\r\n\r\n“Will you come with me to Paris?” asked the Chevalier, addressing the\r\nlittle singer and guitarist: to which the lad, without a moment’s\r\nhesitation, and as if impelled by his destiny, joyfully answered, “Yes.”\r\nThereupon the twain set out for the French capital, and the Chevalier\r\n_gave_ his Italian musician to “Mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\nThe grand-daughter of Henri IV. received Baptiste as she would have\r\nreceived a pug dog,—an animal then very fashionable. For a few days she\r\namused herself with her little musician, then wearily cast him aside,\r\nfinally relegating him to her kitchens, where he was enrolled among the\r\nscullions. It was thus that the nobility and clergy of that day were\r\nwont to treat musicians, great and small. It must not be forgotten that\r\nthe Archbishop of Salzburg, who kept the divine Mozart in his service\r\nfor a certain time, made him wear livery and sent him to take his meals\r\nin the kitchen with the servants.\r\n\r\nWhile washing the dishes or stirring the kitchen fire, and possibly\r\nwhile tasting the sauces, unknown to the _chef_, the little Florentine\r\nlifted up his voice in song. In his spare time he played the guitar or\r\npractised the violin, upon which instrument he is said to have become an\r\naccomplished player.\r\n\r\nOccasionally he was given verses, which he set to music with great\r\nfacility. To Lully is attributed the air which became so popular and\r\nwhich is still sung, more particularly in the country districts, to the\r\nwords “Au clair de la lune, mon ami Pierrot.”\r\n\r\nOne day were sent to him some couplets that were far from laudatory of\r\nthe proud princess, his mistress. The verses greatly diverted Baptiste,\r\nwho composed a pretty air to the words, and sang it to every one. This\r\nafforded much amusement in the kitchen of haughty “Mademoiselle,” who,\r\nhearing of the insult, caused her audacious and disrespectful\r\nscullion-composer to be expelled from her house.\r\n\r\nIn his secret heart, the great musician, that was to be, felt glad when\r\nthus disgraced. He was free; penniless, it is true, but courageous and\r\nfull of hope in the future. He began to study harmony under Gigault, the\r\norganist of St. Nicolas-des-Champs, and ultimately succeeded in gaining\r\nadmittance to the Grande Bande des Violons du Roi, which consisted of\r\nforty performers. Some few airs which he wrote for the violin were\r\nfavorably received and rendered in the presence of the Le Grande\r\nMonarque himself. His Majesty was, indeed, so pleased with the young\r\nartist (Lully was then nineteen), that he appointed him Inspector of the\r\nviolins. And this was not all, for the king organized for Lully’s\r\nsatisfaction another band of musicians, called Les Petits Violons, in\r\norder to distinguish them from the “Grande Bande.”\r\n\r\nFrom that moment a brilliant future awaited the composer. His agreeable\r\nmanners, docile spirit, and a certain wild audacity, that did not\r\ndiminish his profound deference for his benefactor, the king, won and\r\nretained the royal favor; genius did the rest.\r\n\r\nThe little band of violinists, thanks to their skilful training under\r\nthe direction of Lully, achieved wonders, far outstripping the original\r\nband in regard to both time and accuracy of execution.\r\n\r\nBeing now in high favor at court, Lully was authorized to compose dance\r\ntunes for the ballets that Louis XIV. caused to be performed nearly\r\nevery year, and in which his Majesty himself participated. Later he\r\ncomposed the entire musical portion of these entertainments, which were\r\nsometimes called “Mascarades.” He was uniformly successful, and Fortune\r\nhad evidently chosen him for her own.\r\n\r\nEnterprising and full of confidence in his talent and _savoir-faire_,\r\nLully, having formed a friendship with Molière, did not hesitate to\r\nappear as a comedian and to perform in the pieces that were represented\r\nin the great dramatist’s theatre. In 1669, he took the _rôle_ of\r\nPourceaugnac in the piece of that name, and the Mufti in “Le Bourgeois\r\nGentilhomme.”\r\n\r\nCertain writers, contemporaries of Lully, foremost among whom must be\r\nmentioned the great Racine and the no less illustrious La Fontaine, have\r\npassed a somewhat harsh judgment on the composer’s character. It is true\r\nthat he sometimes showed himself a most abject sycophant in presence of\r\nthe nobility at court, and especially before the king. But what courtier\r\nwas not humble in presence of the sovereign of that court? Still, in\r\nspite of his humility before the great, Lully did not completely lose\r\nhis dignity. On certain occasions his retorts to influential persons at\r\ncourt, and even to the king himself, were characterized by remarkable\r\nboldness. Two examples may be given to show the droll and daring humor\r\nof the celebrated composer.\r\n\r\nIt happened, one day, that the Marquis de Louvois, the powerful minister\r\nof Louis XIV., taunted Lully with having secured the king’s friendship\r\nsolely by his talent for buffoonery. To this the musician, drawing up\r\nhis head proudly, made the fearless reply, “Zounds! you would do as much\r\nif you could!”\r\n\r\nAgain, at the first performance of “Armide” at Versailles, Félix Clément\r\ntells us, some unforeseen difficulties prevented the raising of the\r\ncurtain at the appointed time. The king, becoming impatient at the\r\ndelay, sent one of the officers of his guard to inform Lully of his\r\ndissatisfaction. The words, “The king is waiting,” elicited from the\r\ncomposer a reply as sharp as it was wanting in respect. “The king,” said\r\nhe, “is master here, and nobody has the right to prevent him waiting as\r\nlong as he likes!”—a quip more witty than prudent. The courtiers\r\nbelieved that the man who dared to make such a reply was irretrievably\r\nlost; and when “Armide” was given at the Royal Academy of Music on the\r\n15th of February, 1686, the audience, fearful of compromising themselves\r\nif they applauded the work, received it in a depressingly frigid manner.\r\nConvinced of the merit of his score, Lully had it executed a few days\r\nlater for his own satisfaction (as did the king of Bavaria, recently,\r\nwith Wagner’s lyric dramas at the theatre of Bayreuth). Louis XIV.\r\nhearing of this, and feeling that a work which had been pronounced good\r\nby _his_ musician could not be otherwise, set the seal of his praise on\r\nthe score of “Armide,” which immediately obtained a signal success and\r\nwas even proclaimed the best work that Lully had written.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JEAN BAPTISTE LULLY.\r\n\r\n  From an engraving by Bonnart at the British Museum.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt has also been said that the founder of French opera, though humble\r\nand abject in the presence of the powerful, was proportionately insolent\r\nand despotic with his artists and the persons employed at the Opéra. It\r\nis true that Lully often flew into a passion and accused the performers\r\nof clumsiness, and he went so far, on one occasion, as to break the\r\nviolin belonging to one of the members of the orchestra upon the head of\r\nthe unfortunate performer, because he had failed to render a somewhat\r\ndifficult passage in a satisfactory manner. The composer made amends for\r\nhis violence, however, by presenting to the insulted violinist three\r\ntimes the value of the broken instrument, and also by inviting him to\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nApart from the acts he committed in moments of passion, Lully was a\r\nmodel director and far outshone any who preceded him. He found time to\r\ndo everything; he composed, attended the court, saw to the\r\n_mise-en-scène_ of his operas, and superintended the rehearsals of both\r\nthe vocal and instrumental elements of the piece. He paid great\r\nattention to the scenic effects, which were very complicated in that\r\nday, and being a clever comedian and an accomplished dancer, he acted as\r\nstage manager and general director of all dramatic performances.\r\n\r\nLully married the daughter of Lambert, who is mentioned by Boileau in\r\nhis third satire; and their union was a happy one. In the course of time\r\nthe composer became wealthy, and the owner of several houses in Paris.\r\nHis death was brought about by a curious accident. Louis XIV. having\r\nbeen ill, on his recovery, Lully composed, as a thanks-offering, a “Te\r\nDeum” which was performed under his direction at the Feuillants in the\r\nRue Saint-Honoré, on the 8th of February, 1687. During one of the\r\nrehearsals Lully was beating time with his cane, and, in so doing,\r\naccidentally struck his toe, inflicting a bruise. The injury, which\r\nseemed at first nothing more than a slight concussion, speedily\r\ndeveloped into a serious sore; an abscess appeared, and of such a\r\nmalignant character that the doctors considered it would be necessary to\r\namputate the affected part. Lully hesitated to sanction this extreme\r\nstep, and in a short time it became a question, not of amputating merely\r\nthe toe, but the entire foot. The patient would not consent to this,\r\nhowever, and the disease, making rapid progress, soon affected the whole\r\nleg, and the one hope of saving his life lay in the amputation of that\r\nmember. Unfortunately, at the very moment when he appeared willing to\r\nundergo the operation, a quack came on the scene and offered to cure the\r\npatient without recourse to amputation; but the efforts of this\r\nempirical pretender were in vain, and the illustrious composer passed\r\naway at Paris, on Saturday, the 22d of March, 1687, aged fifty-four\r\nyears. Of him Mme. de Sévigné wrote, after listening to some of his more\r\nserious music, “If there be music in heaven, it must be the music of\r\nLully.”\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing qualities of Lully’s dramatic music are nobility of\r\nstyle, correct declamation, and truth of sentiment, dramatic and scenic.\r\nMost of the ornate effects in vocal music which were then fashionable in\r\nItaly were excluded from French opera by Lully.\r\n\r\nIn “Alceste,” a lyric tragedy in five acts, with prologue, the words by\r\nQuinault, Lully’s third work, performed in the month of January, 1674,\r\nwe find the celebrated air sung by Charon. It is a veritable masterpiece\r\nof lyric declamation, and is still frequently sung and has not become\r\nold-fashioned, for it embodies that supreme quality that knows no date,\r\nhuman sentiment voiced in a truthful manner.\r\n\r\n“Cadmus et Hermione” was the first great work produced by Lully. The\r\nmaster had just taken possession of the Palais-Royal hall, as director\r\nof the Opéra, by royal favor, and it was with this piece that he\r\ninaugurated his control. So far, the composer had written only\r\ninterludes, interspersed with songs and dance music, among which the\r\nmost important were those written for pieces by Molière, “Le Bourgeois\r\nGentilhomme,” “La Princesse d’Elide,” “Le Mariage Forcé,” “L’Amour\r\nMédecin,” “Monsieur de Pourceaugnac,” and “Psyché.” He had also written,\r\nprior to his brilliant _début_ as a dramatic composer, the music for the\r\nballets “La Raillerie,” “Le Ballet des Muses,” “Cariselli,” “Les Amours\r\nDéguisés,” and several others.\r\n\r\nBefore his first tragic work, Lully had produced the pasticcio, composed\r\nof airs borrowed from his own _répertoire_, “Les Fêtes de l’Amour et de\r\nBacchus,” a pastoral in three acts for which Molière, Benserade, and\r\nQuinault wrote the words. The composer, ever fortunate, had the pleasure\r\nof seeing, at a performance at which the king was present, the Duke of\r\nMonmouth, the Duc de Villeroy, and the Marquis de Rassen dance in this\r\npastoral; for, with a view to acquire graceful deportment, they were\r\ncontent to mix with professional dancers. This fact is significant of\r\nthe manners of society during that period in the history of France, and\r\nthe applause bestowed by Louis XIV. upon the noble dancers, also\r\nredounded to the credit of Lully and contributed to his promotion.\r\n\r\n“Atys” was a particularly fortunate piece, for it gave especial pleasure\r\nto Le Grande Monarque, who might have said, without undue exaggeration,\r\n“La France, c’est moi!” This work, on which Quinault collaborated, was\r\nproduced for the first time at the Château of St. Germain, in the month\r\nof January, 1678, in the presence of Louis XIV., and was not brought to\r\nthe notice of the Parisians before the month of August of the following\r\nyear. “Atys” was therefore called the “Opéra du Roy.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LULLY.\r\n\r\n  From an engraving in Clément’s Musiciens Célèbres. Probably suggested\r\n    by the Mignard portrait, although the face is reversed.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first performance of this lyric tragedy at St. Germain was made\r\nespecially attractive because the dances were executed by lords and\r\nladies of the court, in conjunction with the ordinary dancers of the\r\nRoyal Academy of Music. Many of the morceaux in “Atys” are worthy of\r\nmention. The critics of the time have greatly eulogized the air “Le\r\nSommeil” in the third act, on account of the persistence of the rhythm\r\nin the bass (four quarter notes).\r\n\r\nJust as “Atys” was called the “King’s Opera,” so “Isis” received the\r\nname of the “Musicians’ Opera.” A music critic of the times writes as\r\nfollows concerning the work: “This opera is the most erudite ever\r\nwritten by Lully, who spent an infinite time upon it. At the court\r\nperformance, the great number of instruments, played by the most\r\naccomplished masters, contributed not a little to emphasize the beauties\r\nof the music.”\r\n\r\nM. de Lajarte, formerly the librarian of the Opéra library, and one of\r\nthe principal collaborators of the publisher, Michaelis, of Paris, has\r\nrecently realized the happy idea of reconstituting and condensing, with\r\npiano accompaniment, the masterpieces of the French opera of the\r\nseventeenth century, and he makes the following interesting remark\r\nrespecting this “great number” of instruments: “The extraordinary number\r\nspoken of by Fresneuse dwindles down to trumpets in the prologue, and\r\nflutes at the end of the third act. But, by a happy coincidence, these\r\ntwo symphonic members of the work which so astonished our forefathers\r\nare also a subject of astonishment for us modern critics, at least in\r\nthe matter of the trumpets. The degree of skill and certainty in\r\ntonguing displayed by the trumpet players in Lully’s orchestra was\r\nnothing short of marvellous.” The trumpet parts in the works of Bach and\r\nHandel are not less difficult of execution, and at this day it would\r\nseem that they could not possibly be played.\r\n\r\nNow that the music known as imitative has made such notable progress,\r\nfrequently exceeding the limits of good taste, now that Meyerbeer,\r\nBerlioz, and, above all, Wagner have carried to such perfection the\r\ncomplicated art of orchestration, it is very interesting to read in the\r\nscore of “Isis” the air imitative of the noises in nature and called the\r\n“air de Pan.” It enables us to realize the extraordinary progress made\r\nin instrumentation since Lully’s time. This air was exceedingly popular\r\nat that day. In addition to the sounds heard in nature, which are not\r\nmade very prominent, however, this page of music is rich in declamation,\r\nand is not without charm. But sweeter to the ear, in our opinion, is the\r\nduet of nymphs in the second act. It is simple, clear, and remarkably\r\ngraceful.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily understood that the limits of this biography will not\r\nadmit of an exhaustive criticism of Lully’s works. We can only point\r\nout, in a somewhat cursory manner, the finest passages of his\r\nbetter-known operas, “Psyché,” “Bellerophon,” “Proserpine,” “Armide,”\r\netc. In “Bellerophon” one is fain to quote the entire prologue, in order\r\nto show the _ideas_, the _subjects_, or, to put it in another way, the\r\nmere melody. This grand spectacular lyric tragedy was performed with\r\ngreat success during ten consecutive months, and it was afterward\r\nreproduced several times.\r\n\r\n“Phaéton”—for some inexplicable cause—has been called the “people’s\r\nopera,” just as “Armide” has been styled the “women’s opera.”\r\n\r\nLully’s “Armide,” although much inferior to the “Armide” of Gluck, must\r\nnevertheless be included among his works best adapted for the stage, and\r\nthe most concentrated in style. Only eight years before the appearance\r\nof Gluck’s immortal “Armide,” that is to say, in 1764, the Academy of\r\nMusic performed the opera of the same name by Lully for the last time,\r\nand with brilliant success.\r\n\r\n“Persée” is, without doubt, one of Lully’s finest works. The score\r\nabounds with charming morceaux, the product of a skilled and fertile\r\npen. This opera held its place for long in the _répertoire_, and each\r\ntime it was revived the public accorded it a favorable reception. The\r\nlibretto, by Quinault, the faithful collaborator of the musician, is\r\nwritten in a superior style, offering excellent situations for the\r\nmusician. Nor should we forget to mention “Proserpine,” Lully’s tenth\r\nopera in order of representation.\r\n\r\nWe have already observed that the distinguishing trait of the dramatic\r\nmusic of Lully, as compared with his contemporaries, is pre-eminently\r\nthe grandeur of his style, with a declamation so exact that it may be\r\ndescribed as perfect. His music is the embodiment of the art of\r\nmoderation in the recitative, and the accessories of song so lavishly\r\nemployed by nearly all the Italian composers of the seventeenth century\r\nare not permitted by him to overwhelm the essential note of the melody.\r\nLully shows less variety, less flexibility in the ensemble of his\r\nproductions, than do Carissimi, Léo, Pergolèse, and Marcello, but he\r\ncomes nearer dramatic truth than any of these masters. His music, for\r\nthe most part, has the killing frost of age upon it; but that he was a\r\nman of genius is scarcely in need of demonstration. He was an innovator,\r\nas surely as was Gluck, and, moreover, was an epoch-maker in operatic\r\nmusic. As a musician he was not without learning, as an examination of\r\nhis overtures will clearly evidence. Some charming pieces for the\r\nclavecin show him as a pleasing and skilful writer for that instrument.\r\nThe student can still find much in Lully’s scores that will repay\r\nthoughtful attention.\r\n\r\nThe name of Lully is inseparable from that of his faithful collaborator,\r\nQuinault, the versatile and imaginative poet who aided the composer by\r\nproviding him subjects which were not only suited to the taste of the\r\ntime, but contained situations adapted for the purposes of the musician.\r\nBefore all and beyond all, Quinault, who in no wise deserved the bitter\r\nsatires that Boileau showered upon him, thoroughly understood the genius\r\nof Lully, and knew how to adapt that genius to the tragedies which he\r\nwas thereby inspired to write.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood why we do not give a facsimile reproduction of\r\nLully’s musical manuscript, when we say that neither in the musical\r\nlibrary of the Opéra, nor in that of the Conservatoire, nor at the\r\nNational Library of Paris, nor anywhere else, can a single note of music\r\nfrom the pen of the founder of French opera be discovered. The same is\r\ntrue of his handwriting, not a line of which has come down to us. All\r\nthat remains of it are three signatures. The composer of the music of\r\n“Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme” has this in common with its author, Molière,\r\nof whose writing only two or three signatures are extant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oscar Comettant]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JEAN PHILIPPE RAMEAU\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of an excellent lithograph portrait of Rameau._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                          JEAN PHILIPPE RAMEAU\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as Lully was the glory of the seventeenth century, so French\r\nmusical genius is represented in the eighteenth by Rameau, the most\r\nlearned theorist and illustrious composer of his time.\r\n\r\nJean Philippe Rameau was born at Dijon on the 25th of September, 1683.\r\nHis father and mother were amateur musicians, and they carefully taught\r\ntheir son the elements of the art of which he was destined to become\r\nsuch a celebrated master. The little Rameau made very rapid progress,\r\nand his numerous biographers are agreed that at the age of seven there\r\nwas no musical score which he could not execute at sight on the\r\nharpsichord.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his extraordinary talent for music, Rameau’s parents did not\r\nwish him to become an artist. They desired that he should enter the\r\nmagistracy, and placed him as a student in the care of the Jesuits. He\r\ndid not make much progress, however, and did not get beyond the fourth\r\nclass in Latin; for his head was full of music and he could not apply\r\nhimself to study, insomuch that he became a deplorable example for his\r\nschool-fellows. His copy-books were annotated with fragments of music\r\nwhich passed through his mind and which he took a great pleasure in\r\nputting upon paper. He was at last sent away from the Jesuit college as\r\nan intractable pupil; he had but a very slight knowledge of Latin,\r\nFrench, or history, and the same might be said of other subjects.\r\n\r\nOn returning to his family he gave himself up completely to the study of\r\nthe harpsichord and the organ, and also learned to play upon the violin.\r\nAs regards harmony, the youthful Rameau failed to get beyond the first\r\nprinciples of that art-science, as he could not find in Dijon any\r\nmusician sufficiently well informed on the rules and practice of\r\ncounterpoint to perfect his knowledge of harmony. Who knows whether it\r\nwas not precisely this unfortunate blank in his studies which caused him\r\nlater on to undertake the theoretical inquiries into the formation of\r\nchords that are the subject of his admirable treatises on harmony?\r\n\r\nBefore he had thoroughly learned the laws of harmony, Rameau, as yet a\r\nbeardless youth, yielded to the law laid down by the little winged god\r\nwhose name is Cupid. He fell madly in love with a widow who was his\r\nneighbor. Everybody knows that nothing exercises a more unfortunate or\r\nmore beneficial influence over the mind of a young lover than the advice\r\ngiven him by the woman he loves. Happily the widow gave good advice to\r\nher adorer. She went so far one day as to reproach him with his\r\nignorance of the French language. “You spell like a scullion!” she told\r\nhim. Rameau did not die on the spot in consequence of this outrage, for\r\nhe was a strong-minded youth; but his face became scarlet, and he\r\npromised to study—a promise he kept.\r\n\r\nRameau’s father, however, who desired to put an end to the intrigue\r\ncarried on by his son—who was as precocious in passionate gallantry as\r\nhe was talented on the harpsichord—broke off the liaison by sending him\r\nto travel in Italy. Rameau did not tear himself away from his fair\r\nneighbor without great emotion, his heart beating _prestissimo\r\nappassionato_; but he was bound to obey the paternal behest.\r\n\r\nThe future author of “Castor and Pollux” was not yet eighteen years of\r\nage when he arrived in Milan. The works of the Italian composers then in\r\nvogue did not at all modify his taste, which was entirely the outcome of\r\nhis own peculiar character. He heard the music of Scarlatti, Lotti,\r\nDuni, Caldara, Leo, and it caused him surprise rather than satisfaction.\r\nHe remained but a short time in the capital of Lombardy, and did not\r\ncontinue his Italian excursion further than that point. He had but one\r\ndesire, and that was to return to France. Chance having brought him into\r\ncontact with a theatrical manager, who had come to Milan to get together\r\nan orchestra and an operatic troupe for a tour in the south of France,\r\nRameau accepted an engagement as violinist. It was several years later\r\nwhen he returned to Dijon. Whether or not he sought the widow for whom\r\nhe had felt such an affection history does not say. We are rather\r\ninclined to think that he did not see her again, as he remained at Dijon\r\nbut a very short time. Henceforth, he patiently awaited the moment when\r\nhe should be able to go to Paris, to sit at the feet of eminent masters\r\nwho would perfect him in the art of composition.\r\n\r\nFinally he left for the French capital, and arrived there in the course\r\nof the year 1717, being then about thirty-four years of age. It was very\r\nlate to commence the study of an art of which he as yet only imperfectly\r\nunderstood the technique. Especially was it late to dream of attaining\r\ncelebrity in theatrical music, access to which was always very difficult\r\nfor unknown composers.\r\n\r\nRameau at last believed that he had found a protector and a professor\r\nwho would be disposed to complete his musical education, in the person\r\nof the organist Marchand, who was held in great esteem in Paris. But\r\nMarchand at once detected the superior genius—although it was then in a\r\nlatent state—of the Dijon musician, and under the influence of fear and\r\njealousy he sent him away. He acted indeed in a most culpable manner\r\ntowards Rameau and showed unjust partiality to others, as we shall see.\r\n\r\nThe position of organist at the Church of St. Paul becoming vacant, it\r\nwas submitted to public competition. Rameau, being obliged to work to\r\nkeep the pot boiling, presented himself as a competitor against one\r\nDaquin, who was an indifferent organist, and still more indifferent\r\ncomposer. Marchand was appointed judge of the competition. According to\r\nthe testimony of all who were present at this interesting trial, Rameau\r\nstood forth immensely superior to Daquin. Nevertheless Marchand decided\r\nin favor of the latter, and consequently the position was given to him.\r\nAfter this check, Rameau was obliged to accept a place as organist at\r\nLille. He left Paris regretfully; but his departure was a source of\r\ngreat satisfaction to Marchand, who feared his presence there.\r\n\r\nRameau did not remain long at Lille. He had a brother at Clermont, in\r\nAuvergne, who was a musician of some talent, and organist of the\r\ncathedral of that city. Wishing to retire, he offered Jean Philippe the\r\nposition which he was leaving, and the place being a remunerative one,\r\nRameau accepted. He was, however, to his deep regret, obliged to enter\r\ninto an engagement for a certain number of years, for towards Paris his\r\neyes were ever turned.\r\n\r\nSituated in the midst of the mountains, the town of Clermont was at that\r\ntime very little visited by strangers, and Rameau concentrated himself\r\nin his own personality. He wrote motets and pieces for the harpsichord.\r\nThere, too, he reflected upon the natural laws governing the formation\r\nof chords, the theory of which had not then been expounded. After deep\r\nand continuous study—like Newton when he discovered the law of\r\ngravitation—Rameau at last discovered the secret of harmony. To him\r\nbelongs the glory of being the first to formulate these laws, in his\r\nfirst work, of which we shall speak presently.\r\n\r\nFour years had passed away, yet Rameau was bound to remain at Clermont\r\nfor several years more, in accordance with the terms of his agreement;\r\nbut he still saw Paris in his dreams, Paris, the only city where he\r\ncould produce his compositions and his book on theory. He was, however,\r\nheld in great esteem at Clermont, and in spite of his repeated attempts\r\nto cancel the agreement he was unable to do so. He then devised a plan\r\nby which he should be sent away from his church for reasons contrary to\r\nthose which were advanced by the friends and admirers who desired him to\r\nremain there. They thought that he was an inspired organist and that his\r\nharmonies were of an elevated and powerful character. Rameau suddenly\r\nbegan to play on his noble instrument like an ignorant musician,\r\ndestitute of ideas, bringing forth such discordant and frightful sounds\r\nthat the clergy were scandalized and the faithful stopped their ears.\r\nRemonstrances were made to him. He answered that he could do no better;\r\nthat it was in this wise that the noble art of the organist had been\r\nsuddenly revealed to him, and that he should always play in this manner.\r\nHe was accordingly dismissed and received his discharge with infinite\r\njoy. At the last service which he attended, when his successor sat by\r\nhis side, he ceased his practical joking and played upon the organ in\r\nsuch a manner as to compel the admiration of all who heard it. He was\r\ndetermined that they should regret his departure, and he succeeded\r\nmarvellously.\r\n\r\nThus Rameau returned to Paris, where, in the course of a short time, he\r\npublished his treatise on harmony. But the subject was so novel and the\r\nexplanations given by the author so abstruse that musicians failed to\r\nunderstand it. This, however, did not prevent them from speaking of it\r\nmalevolently, with the naive and base assurance born of ignorance and\r\nvanity. Profoundly saddened but not discouraged by this result, he\r\nturned to composition for the renown which was not accorded to him as a\r\ntheorist.\r\n\r\nRameau wrote with rare facility cantatas with choruses, sonatas, and\r\nother pieces for the harpsichord, which caused him to be regarded with\r\ngreat interest by the public. Pupils came to him and he obtained the\r\nposition of organist at the church of Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie. He\r\nwould have been perfectly happy in this position, had he not yearned for\r\na grander destiny, of which mention has already been made—success as a\r\ncomposer of grand opera.\r\n\r\nTo test his strength he made his debut in a small theatre, as the author\r\nof the scores for several pieces written by his fellow-Dijonais, the\r\npoet Piron, of happy memory, with songs and dance-tunes, which did not\r\npass unnoticed. Then, resuming his labors on musical theory, he\r\npublished his second book on the subject. This book, like the first, did\r\nnot escape the malevolent criticism of ignorant persons; but this tended\r\nto spread abroad the name of the author, which came to be talked of in\r\nspite of the efforts made to keep it secret. Rameau’s instrumental music\r\nbegan to be sought after, and his pieces for the harpsichord were played\r\neverywhere. This result was not what he had hoped to attain: conscious\r\nof his superiority as a dramatic composer, his goal, as we know, was the\r\nAcadémie de Musique. He applied to the echoes of the neighborhood, that\r\nis to say, to all the lyric poets who had a reputation. These turned a\r\ndeaf ear to his request, being fearful of collaborating at the debut\r\n(always an uncertain matter) of a composer in so difficult, so complex\r\nan art as lyric tragedy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JEAN PHILIPPE RAMEAU.\r\n\r\n  From a lithograph at the Paris Opera Library, made after a drawing by\r\n    E. Nesle.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt last, however, Rameau found the golden key which, so the proverb\r\nsays, opens every door, even the door of the Opera, in the person of the\r\ngreat financier, M. de la Popelinière, whose wife was one of his pupils\r\nand took lessons on the harpsichord. M. de la Popelinière arranged a\r\nmeeting at his house between the most illustrious Voltaire and Rameau,\r\nthe humble aspirant to musical glory. Voltaire promised to write an\r\nopera for the protégé of the great Farmer-General, and this piece\r\nappears in the complete works of Voltaire under the title of “Samson.”\r\nThe literary masterpiece of the great writer pleased Rameau greatly, and\r\nhe set to work upon the accompanying music with great enthusiasm. When\r\nthe score was finished the musician rendered it at de la Popelinière’s\r\nhouse, in presence of Voltaire and a chosen few. Rameau emerged from the\r\nordeal triumphant; but, alas! there’s many a slip ’twixt cup and lip.\r\nThe director of the Académie de Musique would have nothing to do with\r\nthe piece, which he considered unsuitable for the opera, because founded\r\non a biblical subject. It is interesting to remember what Voltaire has\r\nwritten on this question.\r\n\r\n“Rameau,” says he, in speaking of “Samson,” “Rameau, the greatest\r\nmusician in France, set this opera to music about the year 1732. It was\r\nabout to be produced, when the same cabal which at a later date\r\nsucceeded in causing the representations of ‘Mahomet’ (one of Voltaire’s\r\ntragedies) to be suspended, prevented the production of ‘Samson’ at the\r\nOpéra.”\r\n\r\nI do not know whether the cabal spoken of by the author of the\r\n“Dictionnaire Philosophique” was responsible in this matter. I should be\r\ninclined to think that the director of the Opéra simply took counsel\r\nwith himself. Whatever the fact, Voltaire adds:\r\n\r\n“And at the very time when permission was given for this piece\r\n(“Samson”) to be played at the Theatre of the Comédie Italienne, and\r\nwhen ‘Samson’ worked miracles conjointly with Arlequin, permission was\r\nnot granted for the same subject to be represented in a noble and worthy\r\nmanner at the Theatre of the Académie de Musique. Our musician has since\r\nmade use of nearly all the airs in ‘Samson’ in other lyric compositions,\r\nwhich envy was unable to suppress.”\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that Rameau utilized, but long afterwards, a part of\r\nthe music in “Samson” for his opera “Zoroastre.” This work was not his\r\ndébut at the opera. The composer appeared before the Académie de Musique\r\nwith “Hippolyte et Aricie,” by the Abbé Pellegrin, a worldly abbé if\r\nthere ever was one, and a great playwright, concerning whom these verses\r\nwere written:\r\n\r\n                Le matin catholique et le soir idolâtre,\r\n                Il dîne de l’autel et soupe du théâtre.\r\n\r\nM. de la Popelinière advanced 500 livres to the Abbé to secure him\r\nagainst the possible failure of the piece, and Rameau set to work again.\r\nThis opera was given on the first of October, 1733. The composer\r\nattained renown in his fiftieth year: he was old in years but young in\r\nfame, as we have seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RAMEAU.\r\n\r\n  From a copperplate engraved by J. W. Bellinger, Berlin, 1802.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBefore examining the dramatic works of Rameau and forming an opinion as\r\nto their influence upon French art, we will add a few words concerning\r\nthe composer’s personal appearance. He was tall in stature and\r\nextraordinarily thin. His face was furrowed by deep wrinkles; he had an\r\naquiline nose, a broad and open forehead and prominent cheek-bones. The\r\nmouth was large, the look frank and bold and indicative of energy,\r\nperseverance and will power. One might have supposed him a person of\r\ndelicate health, although he was never seriously ill, owing to the very\r\nsober regime which he had adopted. Given much to reflection, he was not\r\ntalkative and never spoke of himself. He married a young lady named\r\nMarie Louise Mangot, who was a good musician and had a very fine voice,\r\nand she made her illustrious husband very happy in his home circle by\r\nher amiable character and her kindness of heart. He had by her three\r\nchildren, one son and two daughters. Rameau died at the age of about\r\neighty-one, in the same month as that which saw his birth—the 12th of\r\nSeptember, 1764—leaving behind him a considerable quantity of dramatic\r\nmusic, although he had only begun to write for the theatre, as we know,\r\nat an age when many men have finished their career.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  STATUE OF RAMEAU IN PARIS OPERA HOUSE\r\n\r\n  Reproduced from a photograph made for this work by special permission.\r\n    One of four life-size statues placed in the vestibule of the Opera\r\n    House, at the foot of the grand marble staircase.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Hippolyte et Aricie” met with but doubtful success, about which there\r\nwas difference of opinion. Accustomed as the public was to the flowing\r\nmusic of Lully, that of Rameau was considered brusque and his harmonies\r\nrough and dissonant. They were indeed very bold for the time. What\r\nastonished the amateurs and put to rout the imitators of Lully, such as\r\nColasse, Desmarets, Blamont, was the novelty of the modulation, the\r\nsuddenness of the changed chords, the character and style of the\r\ninstrumentation. With Rameau, the flutes, hautbois, bassoons, manifested\r\nthemselves at intervals, without any interruption of the general theme\r\nof the symphony. Rameau sought to give and gave to each instrument its\r\nown particular force and value, which enhanced the interest without\r\ndetracting in any degree from the unity of style of the piece.\r\n\r\nAt a later date, when he had attained the full measure of his\r\nexperience, Rameau certainly produced better work than “Hippolyte et\r\nAricie.” At the same time this first opera of the great French master is\r\nfull of dramatic beauty and attractive conceptions. We may cite, as an\r\nexample, the charming chorus of nymphs in the prologue, the graceful\r\ngavotte which was sung: “A l’Amour rendons les armes.” And again, the\r\nfine air sung by Aricie in the first act, the chorus, “Dieux vengeurs,\r\nlancez le tonnerre”; with a purely instrumental page to imitate the\r\nthunder, which certainly does not equal the storm of the pastoral\r\nsymphony, but which at the same time is not wanting in effect,\r\nparticularly the violin arpeggios. The second act, the scene of which is\r\nlaid in the infernal regions, is characterized by a boldness of harmony\r\nand a striking novelty for the period. The two first movements of the\r\nfirst scene are simply pure Weber. The rest is of the same fantastic\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThere is no musician, however humble his attainments, who does not know\r\nand admire the trio of the Fates, “Quelle soudaine horreur.” The\r\nsuccession of chords on the words, “Où cours-tu, malheureux?” are\r\nstriking in their expression. This would appear even at the present day\r\nas a happy and wonderfully effective discovery.\r\n\r\n“Les Indes Galantes,” an heroic ballet, was the second work that Rameau\r\ngave to the Opéra. He was then fifty years of age. The public, who had\r\nbecome more accustomed to the musician’s peculiarly characteristic\r\nstyle, received this work in the most favorable manner. From that time\r\nforth, the master who had experienced such difficulty in obtaining\r\naccess to the Opéra, was rewarded with one long series of triumphs. He\r\nreigned in the opinion of the musicians and the habitués of the Académie\r\nde Musique as an omnipotent sovereign of the art. “Les Fêtes d’Hébé,”\r\n“Dardanus,” “Zoroastre,” “Anacréon,” “Platée,” “Les Fêtes de Polymnie,”\r\n“Les Fêtes de l’Hymen et de l’Amour,” are works which bear the impress\r\nof Rameau’s genius. His talent appeared to the most advantage, however,\r\nin “Castor et Pollux,” his dramatic masterpiece, which indeed is a fine\r\nexample of theatrical music.\r\n\r\nWe mentioned above the theoretical works of Rameau, and now propose to\r\nmake further reference to them. Rameau’s theory, which threw a flood of\r\nlight upon what before his time was darkness and empiricism, is entirely\r\nbased upon the eternal law governing the creation of chords by the\r\nresonances of the monochord. Rameau found in these resonances the\r\n_fundamental bass_ of the different chords composed of a succession of\r\nthirds. This discovery of the fundamental bass showed the true nature of\r\nthe inversions of chords which before the theoretical exposition of the\r\ngreat Dijon master had been considered as so many peculiar kinds of\r\nchords.\r\n\r\nRameau had discovered the natural formation of chords, a thing wonderful\r\nin itself and sufficient to make his name immortal; but in thus\r\nestablishing the principles of harmony he had not established all its\r\nlaws. He left to his didactic successors the work of laying down the\r\nimportant rules of the attraction of notes for the determination of\r\nchords, as also the rules governing their movement in modulation. It is\r\nthus that we find in Rameau’s work certain hazardous harmonies which are\r\nmore due to the non-observance of these laws than offences against good\r\ntaste or fancies of the composer’s imagination. We see, indeed, in the\r\nmusic of this artistic genius successions of fifths, faulty relation of\r\nnotes, brusque modulations offensive to the ear, which are nothing more\r\nthan faults in writing. Thus he who has been truly called the “Father of\r\nHarmony,” made mistakes in harmony which, even at the present day, in\r\nspite of the great liberty taken by composers of the advanced school\r\nwith their successions of modified chords, still remain faults in\r\nmusical grammar.\r\n\r\nRameau wrote his last opera, “Les Paladins,” at the age of\r\nseventy-seven. In reading this score we find nothing to indicate any\r\nfailing of the vigorous mind of this extraordinary musician, who,\r\nfollowing Lully, was the pioneer in the great field of dramatic music\r\nthat Gluck was destined to cover with incomparable power and genius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile musical manuscript written by Rameau.\r\n\r\n  Reproduced from original in the Paris Opera Library.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis article would be very incomplete were we not to say a few words\r\nconcerning the pieces for the harpsichord composed by Rameau, which form\r\nsuch an important item in the fine work by A. Mereaux, “Les\r\nClavecinistes,” containing a selection of pieces by these musicians from\r\n1637 to 1790, classed in their chronological order, and revised,\r\nannotated and accented with the variations and ornaments of the period\r\nand in full notation. What pianist of the present day has not delighted\r\nin playing, from amongst the numerous compositions by Rameau for the\r\nharpsichord, his “Musette,” “Tambourin,” “Poule,” “Rappel des Oiseaux,”\r\n“Fanfarinette,” “Egyptienne,” and “Entretiens des Muses,” etc. Few\r\npianists, however, have succeeded in executing these delightful\r\ninspirations on the instrument for which they were written, and which\r\ngives them their full effect, with all the freshness of idea, color, and\r\ningenious accompaniment. It is a feast for a musical epicure to hear\r\nmusic by Couperin, or Frescobaldi, or Scarlatti played by an educated\r\nmusician and pianist of taste, in conjunction with music by Rameau\r\nexecuted upon a well-preserved or newly-manufactured harpsichord. For\r\nthe celebrated piano manufactory of Pleyel, Wolff et Cie., of Paris,\r\nyielding to the desire expressed by a few artists and amateurs, has made\r\nfor them a limited number of harpsichords which out-rival in a\r\nremarkable manner, both as to quality of sound and the number of pedals,\r\nthe finest instrument of the celebrated Taskin.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, the Paris Society of Musical Composers gave an exclusively\r\nartistic soirée in the Salle Pleyel, the memory of which yet remains. By\r\nthe side of magnificent grand pianos, the most noble instruments\r\nproduced by this musical establishment, was a harpsichord, which gave\r\npromise of great things. It was not found wanting when put to the test;\r\nfor, in the hands of M. Diémer and Mme. Roger-Miclos, two virtuosos\r\nwhose reputation is well established, it rendered the music of the\r\ncomposers who wrote for the harpsichord in a wonderful manner,\r\nparticularly the pieces by Rameau.\r\n\r\nA statue has been erected to the memory of Rameau in his native town of\r\nDijon, due to the initiative of a Dijon composer of considerable talent,\r\nM. Poisot, who opened a subscription in order to put on record the\r\npublic admiration for this great and illustrious musician of Burgundy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oscar Comettant]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TRIUMPH OF RAMEAU.\r\n\r\n  From a rare engraving by Fessard.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ANDRÉ ERNEST MODESTE GRÉTRY\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a portrait by Quenedey painted in 1808._\r\n\r\n  _Grétry at the age of sixty-seven._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                      ANDRÉ ERNEST MODESTE GRÉTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nAndré Ernest Modeste Grétry, the author of “Richard Cœur de Lion,” was\r\nborn at Liège on the 11th of February, 1741. At the age of seven years\r\nhe was placed by his father, a poor musician and one of the violinists\r\nof the Collegiate Church of St. Denis, as a chorister in that church.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate little boy, who was of a delicate constitution and who\r\nsuffered from hemorrhages throughout the whole of his laborious\r\nexistence, was obliged to walk six times every day from his home to the\r\nchurch—a distance of about a mile—in order to take part in the services.\r\nMatins were sung, even in the most rigorous days of winter, between five\r\nand six o’clock in the morning. One day the child arrived somewhat late\r\nat this early service, and although he was not to blame, the\r\nchoir-master obliged him to remain upon his knees for two hours in the\r\nmidst of his fellow choristers. This punishment had such an effect upon\r\nlittle Grétry, who was naturally of a timid disposition, that he would\r\nawake several times during the night in a state of fear lest he should\r\narrive too late. “Without considering the hour or the weather, I would\r\noften start off as early as three o’clock in the morning, through snow\r\nand ice, and would sit down at the door of the church, warming my hands\r\nat my little lantern, which I held on my knees. In this way I used to\r\nsleep more peacefully, because I was sure that they could not open the\r\ndoor without waking me.”\r\n\r\nGrétry finally emancipated himself from this choir, which was a\r\nveritable scholastic place of torment, having learned scarcely anything\r\nof music. His first professor of any importance was the organist of the\r\nChurch of St. Pierre at Liège, M. Renekin, who gave him lessons in\r\ncounterpoint for two years, and kindly encouraged him in his early\r\nessays in instrumental music. The young musician also studied under\r\nMoreau, a talented musician and a methodical and conscientious\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\nIn order to finish his musical studies and because of an ardent desire\r\nto visit other countries, Grétry conceived the idea of going to Rome to\r\nestablish himself there. The idea of separation was not a pleasant one\r\nfor his father. He opposed it for two reasons: his son’s delicate\r\nhealth, and the expense which would necessarily be incurred. However,\r\nthere was no choice but to yield before the determination expressed by\r\nthis young aspirant to musical glory; and Grétry, who was then eighteen\r\nyears of age, started from Liège for Rome. He set forth on foot—being\r\ndestitute of the means which would enable him to make this long journey\r\nby coach or on horseback—after having seen performed a mass of his own\r\ncomposition, in recognition of which a present was made him by the\r\ncanons of St. Denis.\r\n\r\nWith a small stock of money and a pair of pistols given him by his\r\ngrandfather to defend himself against the highwaymen—there were\r\nhighwaymen then, and many of them on the roads of beautiful Italy—Grétry\r\nset out with a guide named Remacle, who, in spite of his sixty years,\r\nwas accustomed to travel on foot from Liège to Rome, and from Rome to\r\nLiège, regularly twice a year. His ostensible profession was that of a\r\nguide, but he also followed the less respectable and more remunerative\r\ncalling of smuggler. Remacle fraudulently carried into Rome quantities\r\nof fine Flanders lace, while from Rome he brought back relics and Popes’\r\nslippers which he supplied to the convents in the Netherlands. Whether\r\nthese slippers had really been worn by his Holiness and whether the\r\nrelics had the origin ascribed to them by the honest Remacle, it is not\r\nnecessary to inquire here: rumor said so, and by faith we attain\r\nsalvation.\r\n\r\nWhen the day fixed for the departure of the young musician arrived, the\r\nguide went to the house of Grétry’s parents. His coming might be likened\r\nto the appearance of a spectre to this poor couple, so deeply affected\r\nwere they by the departure of their child. Without a word the little\r\nfellow laid hold of his valise and strapped it on his back; then knelt\r\ndown with his hands clasped before his father and mother and asked their\r\nblessing. “God bless thee, dear child!” were the simple words pronounced\r\nby the broken-hearted parents, and then the traveller disappeared with\r\nhis guide.\r\n\r\nThe son was not less moved than his father and mother, whose kindly\r\nfaces were bathed in tears and wore the ashy hue of death. “As soon as I\r\nwas able to think calmly,” writes the musician, “I felt tears trickling\r\ndown my cheeks, and I said: ‘O God, grant that thy poor creature may one\r\nday become the support and consolation of his unfortunate parents!’” How\r\ntouching is this simple scene, how eloquently does it speak in favor of\r\nthis patriarchal household which Grétry, by his genius, has made\r\nillustrious; and how strongly are our sympathies moved by the\r\nimmortality earned for it by this most sensible of sons!\r\n\r\nThe brave youth, who was accompanied by a young surgeon, walked\r\nregularly ten leagues a day with his knapsack upon his back. Those were\r\nhard day’s marches. At Trèves the two young men began to fear that they\r\nwould not be able to go any farther, but their energetic determination\r\ngave them strength, and they continued their journey, still at the rate\r\nof ten leagues a day. They passed through the Tyrol, singing the while,\r\nand braved the dangers of the avalanches, and a few days later stood in\r\nrapt admiration of the beautiful land of the Milanese. They afterward\r\nvisited the artistic curiosities of Florence. Every part of Italy was in\r\ntheir eyes an enchanted region. At last Grétry saluted the Eternal City,\r\nwhich he entered by the Porta del Popolo. He had ample time to make\r\nhimself thoroughly familiar with Rome and to carefully study the works\r\nof the Italian masters, then so greatly renowned; for he remained at\r\nleast nine years in Italy. Here he made his early efforts in sacred and\r\nin theatrical music, but without achieving any brilliant success. He was\r\nthen feeling his way, and did not as yet know for what particular style\r\nof music he was best fitted. Chance, however, brought to his notice a\r\ncomic opera by Monsigny, and he at once felt that his true vocation was\r\nthe music best suited to comedy. But as Paris was the only field which\r\noffered him the means of making himself known to advantage in this\r\nbranch of musical art, he resolved to settle in the French capital.\r\n\r\nIn this biography of Grétry it would be unjust to omit the name of the\r\nSwedish Envoy, the Comte de Creutz, who raised the musician’s hopes and\r\nhelped him to continue his struggle at times when he felt greatly\r\ndepressed. M. de Creutz had divined the degree of genius exhibited in\r\nthe early attempts of our musician, although they had not been publicly\r\nsuccessful, and it is fitting that his name should be mentioned in\r\nconnection with the successes of his illustrious protégé. Grétry never\r\nlost an opportunity of testifying his deep gratitude to M. de Creutz.\r\n\r\nWhen, after his long sojourn in Italy, the composer was guided by his\r\nlucky star to settle in Paris, he had neither harpsichord nor\r\npianoforte, and it appears that for some time he pursued his studies\r\nwithout having one of these instruments which are of the first necessity\r\nfor a composer. It was upon a clavichord lent him by M. Louet that the\r\ncomposer wrote: “Les Mariages Samnites,” “Lucile,” “Le Huron,” “Le\r\nTableau Parlant,” “Le Sphinx,” “Les Deux Avares,” “L’Amitié à\r\nl’Epreuve,” and “Zemire et Azor.”\r\n\r\nIn the clavichord, which was the predecessor of the spinet, brass rods\r\nare used instead of pen nibs to make the chords vibrate. Grétry’s\r\nclavichord, which may be found in the interesting collection of the\r\nInstrumental Museum at the Paris Conservatoire, possesses only four\r\noctaves and two notes, as was usually the case with the clavichords of\r\nthe seventeenth century. We asked permission of M. Pillaut, the learned\r\nconservator of the Instrumental Museum, to take a photograph of this\r\nclavichord, which is not only highly interesting in itself, but because\r\nit was the faithful confidant of the master’s inspiration. M. Pillaut\r\ngave the permission asked, and we think it right to tender him our\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRETRY’S CLAVICHORD AT THE INSTRUMENTAL MUSEUM AT THE PARIS\r\n    CONSERVATOIRE.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph made by special permission.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGrétry passed the last years of his life at Montmorency, near Paris, in\r\na house called the _Hermitage_, where the celebrated writer Jean Jacques\r\nRousseau lived for some time and died. Here, retired from the world,\r\nGrétry received his faithful friends of the last days, notably D’Alayrac\r\nand Boieldieu, who lived in a cottage near the _Hermitage_. The old\r\nmaster loved to talk about his art to those who succeeded him in the\r\ncareer, and he lavished upon them the precious counsels of his\r\nexperience. It was in acknowledgment of this great service that\r\nBoieldieu dedicated to Grétry his charming _Opera-Comique, “Jean de\r\nParis.”_ During the latter part of his life Grétry composed nothing, and\r\nafter the death of his wife, which occurred March 17, 1807, he very\r\nrarely visited the theatre. In 1812 Grétry partially rewrote his score\r\nof _Elisa_, which was his last bit of composition. On Sept. 12, 1813,\r\nfeeling very ill, he wrote the following letter to M. Le Breton, life\r\nsecretary of the department of Fine Arts at the Institute:—\r\n\r\n“My dear colleague: It is impossible for me to be present at the\r\nInstitute for the judgment of the musical prize. On arriving at the\r\nHermitage, still convalescent, I was attacked with a hemorrhage which\r\nlasted three days, and from which I lost a pint and a half of blood,\r\nleaving me extremely weak. I now await the end of my long sufferings. I\r\nam resigned, but in leaving this life, I feel that one of my keenest\r\nregrets will be never again to meet my dear colleagues whom I love no\r\nless than I honor them. I pray you to let them see this letter. Adieu,\r\nmy dear colleague; I embrace you with all my heart.\r\n\r\n                                                                GRÉTRY.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRÉTRY’S TOMB AT THE HERMITAGE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA few days later, Sept. 26, 1813, the author of _Richard Cœur de Lion_\r\npassed away. The funeral ceremony took place in Paris, with great\r\nsolemnity. The pall-bearers were Méhul, Berton, Marsallier and Bouilly.\r\n\r\nGrétry’s heart has been the object of much discussion, and even a\r\ntedious law suit. The composer had often expressed in his lifetime the\r\ndesire that his heart should be offered to his native city, Liège. M.\r\nFlamand, one of Grétry’s nephews, having obtained from the prefect of\r\npolice at Paris the authorization to have the body exhumed in order to\r\nsend the heart to Liège, wrote to the mayor of that city and offered him\r\nthis precious token of the illustrious composer’s ardent love for his\r\nnative country. The mayor responded in such terms as to cause M. Flamand\r\nto reconsider his proposition, and the heart was kept at the Hermitage.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 the city of Liège reclaimed the bequest which had been made it,\r\nbut this time M. Flamand absolutely refused to deliver it up. A lawsuit\r\nfollowed which was decided by the court substantially as follows: that\r\nsince the extraction of Grétry’s heart had been demanded by the family\r\nand granted by public authority solely for the purpose of paying homage\r\nto the city of Liege, which had prepared a monument to receive it,\r\ntherefore it should be withdrawn from the garden of the Hermitage, and\r\nsent to the commissioners of the city of Liège. This decree was not\r\ncarried out. The prefect of the Seine and the minister of the interior\r\nobjected. The question was then carried before the council of state, and\r\nin 1828, fifteen years after Grétry’s death, the precious leaden box\r\ncontaining the heart of the illustrious composer was carried to Liège.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRÉTRY’S HERMITAGE.\r\n\r\n  Formerly inhabited by Jean Jacques Rousseau.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRÉTRY’S HERMITAGE.\r\n\r\n  View from the garden behind house.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MEMORIAL CHAPEL.\r\n\r\n  Erected by M. and Mme. Flamand Grétry in Enghien, Montmorency, to\r\n    receive the heart of the illustrious Grétry.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INTERIOR OF CHAPEL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe cannot close this biography of the most celebrated musician of\r\nLiège—one of the most musical cities in Europe—without mentioning the\r\nMusée Grétry at the conservatory in the capital of the Walloon country.\r\nThis most interesting museum, where may be seen the objects which either\r\nformerly belonged to the celebrated composer or serve to remind us of\r\nhim, is the personal work of the present director of the Liège\r\nConservatoire, the learned and distinguished composer, Theodore Radoux.\r\nWe have had the pleasure of visiting this museum—a veritable\r\nshrine—accompanied by M. Radoux, who described the various objects\r\nexhibited, in a most lucid and instructive manner.\r\n\r\nGrétry left Rome for Geneva in the month of January, 1767. A short time\r\nbefore, Favart’s “Isabelle et Gertrude” had been represented at the\r\nComédie Italienne in Paris. It was a success, but the music seemed to be\r\nweak. Grétry seized upon this comedy and wrote new airs for it.\r\n“Isabelle et Gertrude” was represented at Geneva, and was very well\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nIn Paris Grétry was present at a representation of “Dardanus,” by\r\nRameau, which he did not altogether understand, and which, as he\r\nadmitted later, he found to be almost wearisome. He was still too full\r\nof the memories of Italian music—although it had exercised very little\r\nreal influence on his genius—to be able to thoroughly appreciate at its\r\nproper value this essentially dramatic French music, which was at times\r\nsomewhat crude as to harmony and melodious expression, but always suited\r\nto the action. Nevertheless, although this work of the immediate\r\npredecessor of Gluck did not appeal to him strongly, Grétry was not long\r\nin recognizing its true merit. He told himself that Music, although not\r\nmerely the humble handmaid of Poesy, with which she is allied, ought to\r\naid her to express her feelings with due effect, and that consequently\r\ntheatrical music should, as far as possible, be subject to the rules of\r\npure elocution. Following the example of Lully—for whom Grétry always\r\nexpressed great admiration—he was wont to attend the Théâtre-Français to\r\nfind the notes, so to speak, of spoken declamation, and unite it\r\nintimately with song and melody. Moreover, the difficulty he experienced\r\nin finding a piece to set to music gave him a good deal of leisure;\r\nindeed the first two years of Grétry’s stay in Paris were devoted to a\r\nsearch for a poem. At last he obtained from an unknown poet named du\r\nRozoy, “Les Mariages Samnites,” a piece in three acts which was destined\r\nfor the Comédie Italienne but was not accepted at that theatre and was\r\nafterwards rewritten for the Opera. The work was represented there, but\r\nwith great difficulty and bitter mortification for the composer.\r\n\r\nThis essay, which failed to impress the public of the Académie de\r\nMusique, was followed by “Le Huron,” a comedy in two acts by Marmontel,\r\nwhich was represented for the first time at the Italiens on the 20th of\r\nAugust, 1769. The piece was unanimously and we might say even\r\nenthusiastically applauded, both by the audience and by the critics.\r\nAbove all, the care taken by the composer as to good prosody and the\r\nproper feeling peculiar to the _dramatis personæ_, was greatly\r\napplauded. The songs were considered very happy, although they did not\r\nexhibit that graceful variety of form and contour then characteristic of\r\nthe music which the public were accustomed to hear at the Italiens by\r\nmasters like Piccinni, Pergolèse, Jomelli, Galuppi, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter “Le Huron” was given “Lucile,” also a poem by Marmontel, in which\r\na quartet on the words: “Où peut-on être mieux qu’au sein de sa\r\nfamille?” was long celebrated. But in reality “Le Tableau Parlant,” the\r\ncomic opera which followed “Lucile,” consisting of one act in verse by\r\nAnsaume, produced at the Italiens, was the starting point of Grétry’s\r\nfortune. While fully preserving the good humor of the subject of the\r\npiece and the words which are sung during its progress, the composer\r\nsucceeded in clothing the work of the author of the words with\r\nimpressive sonorousness, the telling and well-chosen passages being at\r\nthe same time instinct with frank gaiety.\r\n\r\nFrom that day forth, it may be said that the celebrated composer\r\nthoroughly realized his capacity, and it was easy to see that he would\r\ntake his place in the first rank of comedy in music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile musical manuscript written by Grétry; from Cherubini’s\r\n    collection.\r\n\r\n  The name in upper left-hand corner was written by Cherubini.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGrétry did not and could not succeed in grand opera music. Nature had\r\nnot endowed him with the lofty sentiment of lyric tragedy; he would have\r\nneeded a courage bordering upon temerity or a high-strung imagination to\r\ndare to measure himself with the formidable Gluck, surnamed the Æschylus\r\nof music. But if lyric tragedy was a closed book to him, he nevertheless\r\nsucceeded at the theatre of the Grand Opera in lyric comedy, which he\r\nwas the first to bring to the notice of the Academy. Grétry himself\r\ntakes care to tell us this fact in the following passage of his book:\r\n“When I introduced lyric comedy on the stage of the opera, I was looked\r\nupon as a culpable innovator, and yet I saw that the public was weary of\r\ntragedy, which was always on the boards. I heard many lovers of dancing\r\nmurmur because their favorite art was only allowed to play a subsidiary\r\nand frequently a useless rôle in tragedy. I saw the managers who were\r\ndesirous of adopting the best possible productions, and were feeling\r\ntheir way, unsuccessfully revive fragments or pastorals of former times,\r\nand I said as often as I had the opportunity that two styles of music\r\nplaced in opposition lent each other mutual charms; that the French\r\ncomedians alternately produced tragedy and comedy, and that if they were\r\nobliged to give up these two styles they would not know what to do.” It\r\nwould appear that the public of the Grand Opera shared Grétry’s opinion,\r\nas the composer gave several comedies to that theatre which were\r\nbrilliantly successful, in particular “La Caravane du Caire,” which had\r\na long and fashionable run. This piece was represented for the first\r\ntime before the Court at Fontainebleau in October, 1783, and a little\r\nlater at the Opera. At court, as before the general public, the piece\r\nand its music gave the greatest delight to the spectators. The short but\r\nbrilliant and extremely graceful overture of this work speedily became\r\npopular, not only in France but all over Europe. The morceaux of song\r\nare gay but elevated and are all agreeable, although the public would\r\nhave liked them better had they been more strongly tinged with oriental\r\ncolor than they are. If Grétry did not possess the dramatic afflatus in\r\nlyric tragedy, he exhibited in all his operas of a semi-character an\r\nelevated style which, combined with his exceptional wealth of melody,\r\nplaces him in the first rank of the French masters of the last century.\r\nHe gave to pathetic scenes a wonderful sublimity, an admirable instance\r\nof which may be found in the beautiful prison scene in “Richard Cœur de\r\nLion.” In this work, the fruit of such a rich imagination, Grétry has\r\nexhibited the full measure of his genius and all the talent of which he\r\nwas possessed as a harmonist. It is interesting to remark in regard to\r\nthis opera that Grétry made of certain portions of the celebrated\r\nballad, “Une Fievre brûlante,” a sort of _leit motiv_ after the manner\r\nof Wagner. Indeed, this fragmentary theme returns again and again under\r\ndifferent aspects at least nine times in the course of the score. But we\r\nshall see later that Grétry was Wagner’s predecessor not only for the\r\n_leit motiv_, but that he was also the first to suggest an invisible\r\norchestra such as that of the theatre of Bayreuth. As to the\r\ncharacteristic theme of “Richard Cœur de Lion” (the fragmentary ballad\r\nconsidered in its transformations as playing the part of the modern\r\n_leit motiv_), it is curious to notice that Grétry used it in this comic\r\nopera with exactly the same idea as Wagner in his lyric dramas. Whenever\r\nallusion is made to the royal prisoner, described in the ballad sung by\r\nBlondel, a fragment of this air appears. And when Blondel sings to this\r\nsame air, but in common measure, the following words:\r\n\r\n                       Sa voix a pénétré mon âme,\r\n                       Je la connais, Madame,\r\n\r\n“is it not,” writes Grétry, “as though he said: ‘His voice has gone to\r\nmy heart while he sang the air which he made for you.’”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRÉTRY\r\n\r\n  From an engraving after a painting by Mme. Vigée-Lebrun, in 1785, the\r\n    year of the first representation of “Richard Cœur de Lion.”\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Richard Cœur de Lion”—the denouement of which was changed by the author\r\nof the piece, Sedaine, at least three times—marks the culminating point\r\nof the master’s career. The piece had a great and lasting success, and\r\nit remains still in the répertoire of the Opéra Comique. The\r\ninstrumentation has been reconstructed in a very careful and happy\r\nmanner by Adolphe Adam.\r\n\r\nAfter this work Grétry produced several others, which did not, however,\r\nmeet with the same good fortune. Nevertheless, Grétry occupies a place\r\nof honor in the history of theatrical music, and his style is remembered\r\nas original. If he never acquired the dexterity of the adepts at\r\ncounterpoint then in renown, and if his harmonies are at times awkward\r\nand even faulty, they still have a peculiar attraction which makes them\r\nnot only acceptable but original and charming.\r\n\r\nOne day when I went to see Auber in his little house in the Rue St.\r\nGeorges I found the author of “La Muette de Portici” and the “Domino\r\nNoir” at the piano with one of Grétry’s scores in front of him. “Just\r\nlook at this passage,” said Auber, “it is very curious, considered as to\r\nthe succession of chords. This harmony is certainly not correct, and\r\nwould never have entered the mind of what is called a musical savant.\r\nAnd yet if you try to change it you may make it more accurate, but it\r\nwill be wanting in relief and expression.” That is because the\r\nawkwardness of Grétry is the awkwardness of an artistic genius, and\r\nawkwardness of that kind is a thousand times better than the accuracy of\r\nthe cold and unimaginative musician.\r\n\r\nI said above that Grétry had the first intuition of the _leit motiv_ in\r\n“Richard Cœur de Lion,” as a device for recalling to the spectator\r\neither an event, a scene, an essential object or a personage, with their\r\ndistinctive peculiarities, at the same time preserving unity of style in\r\nthe general construction of his work;—I said that he also imagined an\r\ninvisible orchestra such as that which exists in the Wagner Theatre at\r\nBayreuth. Grétry speaks as follows in his work, “Mémoires et Essais sur\r\nla Musique,” in the chapter entitled: “Plan for a new Theatre”:\r\n\r\n“I should like the auditorium of my theatre to be small, holding at the\r\nmost a thousand persons, and consisting of a sort of open space without\r\nboxes, small or great, because these nooks only encourage scandal or\r\nworse. I should like the orchestra to be concealed so that neither the\r\nmusicians nor the lights on their music-stands would be visible to the\r\nspectators. The effect would be magical, the more so as it is always\r\nunderstood that the orchestra is not supposed to be there. A solid stone\r\nwall ought, in my opinion, to separate the orchestra from the theatre,\r\nso that the sound may reverberate in the auditorium.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oscar Comettant]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRÉTRY CROSSING THE STYX.\r\n\r\n  “Grétry in crossing the Styx plays upon his lyre to beguile the time.\r\n    ‘Why do you not row?’ he asks Charon.... ‘Because I am listening!’”\r\n\r\n  Drawn by Joly and engraved by Duplessi-Berlaus.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRANÇOIS ADRIEN BOIELDIEU\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a lithograph portrait by Grevedon, 1826, after a\r\n    painting by Riesener._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                       FRANÇOIS ADRIEN BOIELDIEU\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 15, 1775, there was born in Rouen a composer who was to\r\nleave an indelible imprint of his abilities upon the operatic music of\r\nFrance. At the beginning of his career there was nothing in his\r\ncircumstances that could have presaged his future greatness. He was the\r\nson of the secretary of Archbishop Larochefoucauld, and his mother kept\r\na small millinery store in the old-fashioned city. His parents did not\r\nenjoy perfect conjugal felicity, and finally their quarrels led to a\r\ndivorce, soon after which the father married again. The young Boieldieu\r\nwas designed for a musical career, and his father soon sent him to the\r\ncathedral as a choir-boy. In those days music was frequently made a\r\nmatter of apprenticeship, and was studied almost as if it had been a\r\nhandicraft; it is therefore not surprising to find the lad indentured to\r\nthe cathedral organist Broche, who led him a sorry life. Those who are\r\nfamiliar with the early life of Haydn will recall how that composer was\r\nforced for a time to be merely the lackey of Porpora; Boieldieu was in\r\nstill worse case, for his master was both a drunkard and a martinet, and\r\nmany a corporal punishment was inflicted on the apprentice merely\r\nbecause of errors in musical exercises. It seems strange that the rough\r\ninduction into the art did not cause the lad to hate music and finally\r\ndesert it, but, as was the case with Beethoven, the tears of childhood\r\nonly seem to have cemented the foundation of his education. Broche made\r\nthe curriculum hard and dry enough, and the companions of the lad (“le\r\npetit Boiel” they called him then) added to his discomforts by laughing\r\nat his shyness and awkward ways.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough Boieldieu stood in mortal terror of his brutal\r\ntaskmaster, and the culmination of his fright came one day when he\r\naccidentally upset an ink bottle on one of Broche’s books; expecting\r\nnothing less than capital punishment for such a heinous crime, the boy\r\ntook to his heels, and, at the age of twelve, ran away to Paris. How he\r\nmanaged to get there without money or assistance is not clearly known,\r\nbut he eventually arrived and sought out some relatives who dwelt in the\r\nFrench metropolis. These gave him shelter, but at the same time notified\r\nhis parents, who soon took him back to his musical and menial drudgery.\r\nNevertheless his condition seems to have been bettered by his escapade,\r\nfor Broche was warned to use milder measures with him, and he remained\r\nat his studies with the organist until he was sixteen. During these four\r\nyears his taste for operatic music began to awaken, and he was a\r\nconstant attendant at the performances in the provincial theatre. As he\r\nhad no money he was obliged to resort to all kinds of expedients to\r\nobtain admission, and there are many anecdotes extant of his ingenious\r\nefforts to hear this or that opera without going through the slight\r\npreliminary of paying for his admission. At times he would slip into the\r\ntheatre early in the morning, carrying a bundle of music, as if he had\r\nbeen sent as messenger to some of the orchestra, and then, by hiding\r\nthrough the day, often without food, he managed to stand through the\r\nperformance in the evening, after which he would hurry home well\r\ncontented with his good fortune. The operas which he heard at this\r\nperiod of his career were chiefly those of Grétry or of Mehul, as both\r\ncomposers were much in vogue at that time, and he was much influenced by\r\ntheir light and melodious style. It was not long before his ambition was\r\nawakened to an attempt to imitate them and to compose an opera himself.\r\nHe was eighteen years old when he accomplished this task. He had sought\r\nin vain for a libretto, and finally had recourse to his father, who gave\r\nhim the text for an opera which enjoyed an evanescent success. “La Fille\r\nCoupable” was the name of this Opus 1, which was completed in 1793 and\r\nhas now disappeared. One can imagine that the audiences were neither\r\nover-refined or hypercritical in those days of the Reign of Terror, but\r\na more cultivated era soon followed, and the second opera, which came\r\ntwo years later, and was entitled “Rosalie et Myrza,” was less favorably\r\nreceived. Boieldieu was not yet ripe for operatic composition, but at\r\nleast these works furthered his career in that they obtained him the\r\nprivilege of free entrance to other operatic performances, and thus his\r\nexperience and taste were gradually expanded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BUST OF BOIELDIEU BY DANTAN.\r\n\r\n  From the Carnavalet Museum, Paris.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe partial success fired his heart sufficiently for him to leave Rouen\r\nand seek Paris for the second time. This time he carried with him thirty\r\nfrancs, an operatic score, and an abundance of self-confidence. He was\r\nnow nineteen years old. His reception was the chilling one usually\r\naccorded to young composers in Paris, and very soon he began to feel the\r\nnippings of hunger, which put the thoughts of public success out of his\r\nhead for the nonce, and drove him to teaching piano. He however had the\r\ngood fortune to make the acquaintance of the celebrated tenor Garat, and\r\nthis gentleman became interested in him, and finally sang some of his\r\n_chansons_ in public and in fashionable drawing-rooms. These little\r\nsongs soon found favor, and Boieldieu became gradually known through\r\nthem. M. Cochet, the publisher, paid him twelve francs each for these\r\nproductions, a figure which seems ridiculous until one remembers that\r\nSchubert sometimes accepted a franc or two for some of his immortal\r\n_lieder_. Some of these early works of Boieldieu are still in the\r\nmusical repertoire, and are occasionally heard in concerts, as for\r\nexample, “O toi que j’aime,” and “Menestrel,” and they served at the\r\ntime to spread the social success of the composer. Finally Boieldieu\r\nmade the acquaintance of Fiévée, the novelist, who wrote for him a short\r\nlibretto in one act, “La Dot de Suzette,” and this opera, after many\r\nintrigues and jealousies, achieved performance and success, thanks to a\r\nbright libretto, sparkling melodies, and the excellent performance of\r\nMadame St. Aubin.\r\n\r\nBoieldieu’s prospects now changed with Aladdin-like suddenness, for his\r\nnext opera, “La Famille Suisse,” was performed at the Theatre Feydeau\r\nfor thirty nights in alternation with Cherubini’s “Medee,” and thus\r\nearly began that connection with the great Italian maestro, at that time\r\nthe best musician in France, which was to be so fruitful of good results\r\nto the new favorite. In 1798 Boieldieu turned for a while from operatic\r\nwork, and composed a number of piano sonatas, piano and harp duets, and\r\na piano concerto. Although these exercised no permanent influence on the\r\nart, they obtained for him the appointment of professor of piano at the\r\nParis Conservatoire, two years later. In this position, however he was\r\nnot very successful; he was too much wrapped up in composition to make a\r\ngood teacher. The musical historian Fétis, who was his pupil, confirms\r\nthis estimate; but the post at the Conservatoire led to a close\r\nacquaintance with Cherubini, by which Boieldieu began to remedy his lack\r\nof knowledge of counterpoint and fugal work. Although Fétis denies that\r\nBoieldieu was ever the pupil of Cherubini, there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that this was the case, even if a regular stipend was not paid\r\nfor the tuition. The very fact that in 1799 the two worked in\r\ncollaboration on “La Prisonnière” might tend to show that Boieldieu was\r\nanxious to attain something of Cherubini’s musical learning, and his\r\nsubmission of many later operas to the judgment of this master proves\r\nthat he was willing to be guided by him.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Boieldieu produced two operas that carried his fame\r\nbeyond his native country; these were the Polish “Benjowski” and the\r\nvery tuneful “Caliph of Bagdad,” both of which will receive further\r\nmention in the analytical portion of this article. A little later there\r\nappeared a more advanced work,—“Ma Tante Aurore.” The success was now so\r\nwell established that all Parisian managers sought for works from the\r\ngifted pen, and opera followed opera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TOMB OF BOIELDIEU IN PÈRE LACHAISE, PARIS.\r\n\r\n  From a lithograph.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBoieldieu now lived on contentedly in Paris until 1802, when he almost\r\nwrecked his career in the same manner that his father had done; on March\r\n19th of that year he married a ballet-dancer named Clotilde Mafleuroy,\r\nand immediately began to taste the bitterness of conjugal misery. He\r\nsuddenly left Paris on this account and sought employment in Russia. He\r\nwas received in St. Petersburg with open arms, and the Czar Alexander at\r\nonce appointed him _capellmeister_ of the court. He produced little on\r\nthis barren soil however, and although he stayed there eight years, and\r\nhis contract called for three new operas and a number of military\r\nmarches annually, scarcely anything of this period has been preserved.\r\nIn 1810 the political horizon began to darken, and trouble between\r\nRussia and France became so imminent that our composer again suddenly\r\npacked up and returned to his beloved Paris, arriving at the beginning\r\nof 1811. Here however he found everything changed. The Napoleonic wars\r\nhad exerted a deleterious influence on operatic patronage, and the\r\ntaste, too, had changed in some degree; Cherubini and Mehul were silent,\r\nand Isouard alone ruled _Opera Comique_. Considerable jealousy of\r\nBoieldieu was at this time displayed, and at first he was unsuccessful\r\nin having any of the works he had written in Russia performed in Paris;\r\ntherefore he set himself to producing an original work, and in 1812,\r\n“Jean de Paris,” a masterpiece of its kind, was produced at the Theatre\r\nFeydeau. Again a success was won, although not such a phenomenal one as\r\nthe “Caliph of Bagdad” had attained, and for the next six years another\r\nseries of operas proved that the composer had not lost his hold upon the\r\nParisian public, and in addition to his own operas Boieldieu\r\ncollaborated with Cherubini and Isouard. Two years later a great success\r\nattended the first production of “Le Chaperon Rouge,” but the composer\r\nwas so exhausted by this effort that he was obliged to rest for a while\r\nfrom further composition. He now received the position of professor of\r\ncomposition at the Conservatoire, taking the place of Mehul, and for\r\nseven years he produced nothing more in opera. The crowning work was\r\nhowever to come later. During a stay at his brother’s farm in Cormeilles\r\nBoieldieu began composing once more. This time it was something far\r\nbeyond his previous efforts, it was a _chef d’œuvre_ in the domain of\r\ncomic opera,—the ever-beautiful “La Dame Blanche.” This masterwork was\r\nperformed in December, 1825, and at once awakened boundless enthusiasm.\r\nBoieldieu was not much exhilarated by the result, for he seemed to feel\r\nthat he could never hope to equal this work again. Nevertheless he soon\r\nattempted another subject, as if to ascertain if his surmises were\r\ncorrect. Bouilly’s dull libretto, “Les Deux Nuits” was accepted, as much\r\nfrom friendship as from any other motive. The new opera was finished in\r\n1829, and made a flat failure, a result which hurt Boieldieu’s feelings\r\nin an inordinate degree. He had brought back a pulmonary trouble from\r\nRussia, and his disappointment seemed to aggravate the disease. He gave\r\nup his position at the Conservatoire, feeling too weak to continue\r\nteaching. The director of the _Opera Comique_ had given Boieldieu a\r\npension of 1200 francs for his great services to the art, but the\r\nexpulsion of Charles X. now came about, a new direction was installed,\r\nthe institution was found to be bankrupt, and the income from this\r\nsource ceased just when it was most needed. He had married again in\r\n1827, and this time the union was a fortunate one, for in these final\r\ndays of trial, sickness, and pecuniary difficulty, his wife sustained\r\nhis drooping spirits with unswerving fidelity. She was a singer, Philis\r\nby name, and was the mother of Boieldieu’s only son, a composer of good\r\nattainments, but overshadowed by his father’s ability. Finally Louis\r\nPhilippe was established on the throne of France, and his minister, M.\r\nThiers, made speedy recognition of the value of Boieldieu’s work by\r\ngranting him an annual pension of 6,000 francs. It could not give back\r\nthe composer’s health, however, and, after a tour to Pisa he came back\r\nworse. He had been obliged by poverty to take back his old position at\r\nthe Conservatoire, and made a brave effort to continue in it, but it was\r\nuseless; in another tour in hopeless search for health, he died at\r\nJarcy, October 8th, 1834. At the tomb his old companion and teacher,\r\nCherubini, gave a last tribute to the modest and talented nature that\r\nhad passed away so prematurely.\r\n\r\nBoieldieu may be summed up in a single phrase as a Parisian Mozart. He\r\nhad Mozart’s gift of melody and grace, and in his later years something\r\nof Mozart’s skill in harmonic and contrapuntal combination, but, unlike\r\nMozart, his work can be divided into three epochs, the third only being\r\ncomparable in _ensemble_ to the works of the German master. Boieldieu\r\nhas been ranked as the best composer of _opera comique_ that France ever\r\nproduced, and it is not too much to say that only Bizet has approached\r\nhim in characteristic touches and poetic inspiration. Three works are at\r\npresent the chief representatives of Boieldieu’s fame, “The Caliph of\r\nBagdad,” which shows his earliest method, “Jean de Paris,” which is a\r\ngood example of his second period, and “La Dame Blanche,” which is the\r\nfinest of all his operas, the best outcome of the French _opera comique_\r\nschool, and shows the composer in his third and best period of growth.\r\n\r\nBoieldieu was never misled by the popular applause which was showered\r\nupon him before it was fairly deserved. It has been well said that\r\n“there is no heavier burden than a great name acquired too soon,” and it\r\nis to the credit of Boieldieu that, although he acquired this burden\r\nwith “The Caliph of Bagdad,” which has had over a thousand performances\r\nin France, he did not continue in the rather frivolous vein which had so\r\ncaptivated his earliest audiences. His modest desire to advance may be\r\nproven by the fact that when this opera was achieving its greatest\r\nsuccess, Cherubini reproached him with “Malheureux! are you not ashamed\r\nof such an undeserved success?” when Boieldieu mildly begged for further\r\ninstruction, that he might do better in the future. He even courted the\r\nopinions of his pupils in the Conservatoire as to portions of his work,\r\na rather dangerous meekness. Pretty tunes and marked rhythms are the\r\ncharacteristics of this period. “Zoraime et Zulnare,” although at\r\npresent almost unknown, always remained a favorite of the composer, but\r\nit is only another example of musicians not being the best judges of\r\ntheir own works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile musical manuscript written by Boieldieu.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Benjowski” is a transition towards his second period. It has a Polish\r\nplot written by Kotzebue, and its music has much local color. It was\r\ncomposed in 1800, but was retouched by Boieldieu a quarter of a century\r\nlater, when he wittily said, “It smells of Russia leather!” The opening\r\nquartette in this work is very dramatic.\r\n\r\n“Ma Tante Aurore” may be said to begin the second period. It preserves\r\nthe brightness of the first period, but is much finer in its scoring,\r\nand it is no exaggeration to say that in this matter Boieldieu surpassed\r\nall of his contemporaries in France, with the sole exception of\r\nCherubini. The versatility displayed in this period speaks of growth.\r\n\r\nThe eight years spent in Russia may be passed over with but slight\r\ncomment, for of all that he wrote there, he cared to preserve but three\r\noperas, “Rien de Trop,” “La Jeune Femme,” and “Les Voitures Versées.”\r\nOne cause of the weakness of the works of this period was the fact that\r\nno good librettos were obtainable, and the composer was even obliged to\r\nuse many that had been set by other musicians.\r\n\r\nSome commentators class “Jean de Paris” in the third period of\r\nBoieldieu’s work. It is a beautiful and characteristic opera; the song\r\nof the Princess, full of charming grace, the bold and dashing measures\r\nof the page, and the stiff, ceremonious style of the music of the\r\nSeneschal, are a few of the striking touches that go to make up a very\r\nbrilliant work which has not yet disappeared from the repertoire, but\r\nwhen compared with “La Dame Blanche” the ensemble-writing is seen to be\r\ninferior. In this latter opera, the climax of his works, Boieldieu did\r\nnot depart from the melodious character of his first and second periods,\r\nbut rather added to it. All through his career he clung to the\r\nfolk-song, and exactly as “Der Freischütz” was evolved by Weber from the\r\nGerman _Volkslied_, so “La Dame Blanche” had its root in the French\r\n_Chanson_. The libretto was evolved by Scribe from Scott’s works by\r\namalgamating the “Monastery” and “Guy Mannering,” but spite of the\r\nintroduction of “The Bush aboon Traquier” and “Robin Adair” (the latter\r\nnot a true Scotch song) the flavor is by no means Scotch either in\r\nlibretto or music. The harmonization of the finales of this opera is\r\nbeyond anything that has been attained in French _opera comique_, and\r\nshows Boieldieu as a master in a school of which we find no traces in\r\n“The Caliph of Bagdad.” Yet through all the three periods one finds the\r\nthread of the _Chanson_ running melodiously. Music that is sincerely\r\nnational can never die, and the secret of the success of Boieldieu’s\r\noperas, and their perennial freshness may be found in the fact that the\r\ncomposer builded upon the music of his country, and there is no firmer\r\nfoundation possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Louis C. Elson]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ETIENNE NICOLAS MÉHUL\r\n\r\n  _Reproduced from an aquatint portrait by Quenedey._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                         ETIENNE NICOLAS MÉHUL\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most unique and interesting figures in the French musical\r\nworld of the close of the eighteenth century is Etienne Nicolas Méhul.\r\nSprung from comparative obscurity, he mounted to a world-wide fame.\r\nStarting out in life with the scantiest educational advantages, he\r\nreached a high degree of elegant culture. Living in a most dissolute\r\nperiod, he retained through life an irreproachable character. The son of\r\na cook in a regimental barracks, he was tendered the position of\r\nchapelmaster by the great Napoleon.\r\n\r\nMéhul was born at Givet, in the Ardennes, June 22, 1763. Like many other\r\ngreat composers, he was of low degree, had but few opportunities for\r\nstudy at the start, and struggled hard to gain his musical footing. His\r\ntalent displayed itself at an early age and he himself never had a doubt\r\nas to his ultimate vocation in life, though his naturally religious\r\ndisposition had predetermined his parents to send him to a monastery. At\r\nten years of age he played in the Franciscan Church at Givet, such\r\nqualifications as he may have had being the result of his studies with a\r\nblind organist. Shortly after this time, Wilhelm Hauser, a distinguished\r\nGerman organist, arrived at the neighboring convent of La Val Dieu,\r\nwhither the boy repaired to pursue his studies. He was fortunate enough\r\nto attract the favorable attention of the Abbé Lissoir, under whose\r\nauspices he studied for three years with Hauser. He made such rapid\r\nprogress that he soon equalled his master and was appointed deputy\r\norganist at the convent. It is altogether probable that he would have\r\nbeen his successor had not good fortune attended him again. His playing\r\nattracted the notice of an officer of the garrison, who was a musical\r\namateur, and it needed but little solicitation to induce the boy to go\r\nto Paris. He arrived at the capital in his sixteenth year and placed\r\nhimself under the tuition of Edelmann, a Strasburg composer of eminence,\r\nwho some years afterward deserted music for politics and perished\r\nultimately upon the same scaffold to which he had consigned many a\r\nvictim. With Edelmann he studied both the piano and composition,\r\nsupporting himself meanwhile by giving lessons and writing sonatas and\r\nminor compositions for that instrument. The genius of his good fortune\r\ndid not desert him in these days of stress. It was shortly after his\r\narrival in Paris that Gluck’s “Iphigénia en Tauride” was placed in\r\nrehearsal. The popular interest in the performance had been heightened\r\nby the feud which had raged so bitterly between the Gluck and Piccini\r\nfactions. Méhul caught the infection and, being without the money to\r\npurchase a ticket, he smuggled himself into the theatre the day before,\r\nintending to remain in concealment until the next eventful evening. He\r\nwas discovered, however, by one of the inspectors, and as the latter was\r\non the point of ejecting him, Gluck’s attention was drawn to him. He\r\nmade some inquiries, and upon learning the facts in the case gave the\r\nyoung man a ticket. It was the turning-point in his career and decided\r\nthe direction he should take; for Gluck followed up the chance\r\nacquaintance, took a decided interest in Méhul, gave him the benefit of\r\nhis experience and advice and instructed him in the dramatic qualities\r\nof music. The young composer already had produced a cantata at the\r\nConcert Spirituel, written upon the subject of Rousseau’s Sacred Ode,\r\nand was ambitious to become known as a composer of church music, for the\r\nreligious element was always strong in him; but Gluck changed all this\r\nand set his feet in the path of the opera, which he was destined to\r\nfollow to the end of his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MÉHUL.\r\n\r\n  From a lithograph portrait loaned by the British Museum.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMéhul began his dramatic work by writing three operas (“Psyché et\r\nl’Amour,” “Anacréon” and “Lausus et Lydie”) merely for the sake of\r\npractice. He was testing his wings before flight. He made his debut\r\nbefore the public with “Euphrosine et Coradin” in 1790 and achieved a\r\nbrilliant success, though his first opera was “Cora et Alonzo,” which\r\nwas produced later and met with only a moderately favorable reception.\r\nHe was now in the full tide of musical activity, and opera after opera\r\ncame from his prolific genius. “Stratonice” followed “Euphrosine,” and\r\nby many was considered his masterpiece, especially for the fine\r\ntreatment of the ’cello parts, which instrument he had specially\r\nstudied, and for the general excellence of the orchestration as well as\r\nits dramatic strength, in which quality he showed his close study of\r\nGluck. The revolutionary period which now ensued was not favorable to\r\nthe opera, and as if in sympathy with the depressing character of the\r\ntime, Méhul brought forward such works as “Doria,” “Horatius Cocles,”\r\n“La Caverne,” and others, which did not add to his reputation. There\r\nwere others, however, that proved an exception to the rule. “Le jeune\r\nHenri” for instance, was hissed because it introduced a royal personage,\r\nbut the overture, with its lively and picturesque representation of the\r\nchase, was demanded several times over at the close of the performance.\r\nThe overtures to both “Adrien” and “Ariodant” were also general\r\nfavorites, as well as the romanzas in the latter. It was about this time\r\n(1799) that Méhul had his first encounter with some of the French\r\ncritics, particularly Geoffroy, a well-known writer, who declared that\r\nhe could not write in any other than a severe and heavy style. Shortly\r\nafterwards the opera of “Irato,” written in the Italian style, appeared\r\nanonymously. After its first performance the journalist wrote: “This is\r\nthe way in which Méhul should compose.” The composer had his revenge on\r\ndeclaring himself the author and followed it up with another opera, “Une\r\nFolie,” in which his critic was satirized. Soon afterwards, however, he\r\nlapsed into the serious style. In 1806 he produced “Uthal,” in which he\r\nmade the daring innovation, at the suggestion of Napoleon it is said, of\r\ndoing away with the violins entirely and filling their places with the\r\nviolas, as better adapted to the sombre Ossianic character of the\r\ncomposition. The result was so depressing that Grétry, who was present\r\nat the first performance, made the remark: “I would give a louis to hear\r\nthe sound of a chanterelle, or the E string of the violin.” Undismayed\r\nby the reception of “Uthal,” Méhul followed it up with “Joanna,”\r\n“Hélène,” “Les Amazones” and “Gabrielle d’Estrées,” all written in the\r\nsame serious style, showing high scholarship in counterpoint, but\r\nlacking in those light and elegant graces of composition which were so\r\npopular with the French. His activity was great during this period.\r\nBetween 1791 and 1807 he wrote no less than twenty-four operas, besides\r\nsix symphonies; music to poems of Chénier, Arnault and Sontanes,\r\ncomposed in honor of the Republican fêtes at which Napoleon presided,\r\namong them the “Chant du Départ,” “Chant de Victoire” and “Chant de\r\nRetour”; choruses to the tragedy of “Timoleon”; the incidental music to\r\n“Oedipus” and the drama of “The Hussites”; four ballets, “Le Jugement de\r\nParis” (1793), “La Dansomanie” (1800), “Le Retour d’Ulyss” (1807), and\r\n“Persée et Andromède” (1810); besides many operettas and smaller works.\r\nHe had enjoyed the favor of Napoleon to such an extent that upon the\r\ndeath of Paisiello he was offered the position of chapelmaster. Méhul,\r\nwho was a devoted friend of Cherubini, was anxious that the latter\r\nshould share the office with him, but Napoleon, who was incensed at a\r\nsharp reply Cherubini had made him in Vienna, sent word back to Méhul:\r\n“What I want is a chapelmaster who will make music and not noise,” and\r\nat once nominated M. Sueux to the position. Méhul was not without his\r\nhonors, however, having been appointed a member of the Institute in\r\n1795, and of the Legion of Honor in 1802.\r\n\r\nIn 1807 he achieved the crowning success of his career. “Joseph,”\r\nwritten on a Biblical subject, was produced and spread his fame all over\r\nFrance and Germany. Though not often heard in this country, it still\r\nremains a great favorite to-day among the Germans by its dignity,\r\nnobility and elevated style. It made ample compensation for his many\r\nfailures and regained for him all the advantages he had lost. After 1810\r\nhe wrote but little, “Le Prince Troubadour” (1813) and “L’Oriflamme”\r\n(1814), written with Berton, Kreutzer and Paer, being his most important\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MÉHUL\r\n\r\n  From a portrait in Clément’s “Les Musiciens Célèbres.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nMéhul made his parting bow to the public with the opera of “La Journée\r\naux Aventures,” which was produced in 1817 with considerable success.\r\nThe same year closed his earthly labors. He had been in ill health for\r\nsome time, and shortly after the production of his last opera he went,\r\nupon the advice of friends, to the south of France, where he had a\r\nresidence, hoping thereby to regain his strength. His ailment,\r\nconsumption, however, had so weakened his constitution that the change\r\nwas fruitless. Moreover, he was homesick for Paris. In writing to a\r\nfriend he mournfully says: “I have broken up all my habits. I am\r\ndeprived of all my old friends, I am alone at the end of the world,\r\nsurrounded by people whose language I can scarcely understand—and all\r\nthis sacrifice to obtain a little more sun. The air which best agrees\r\nwith me is that which I breathe among you.” He returned to Paris, warmly\r\nwelcomed by his friends and the public. He made one, and only one more\r\nvisit to the opera. He was soon stricken down in his last illness and\r\ndied Oct. 18, 1817, in his fifty-fourth year, universally lamented both\r\nin France and Germany, for, like his pupil Hérold, he was as much of a\r\nfavorite in the latter country as in the former. In fact neither of\r\nthese composers was appreciated to the full extent of his ability in\r\nFrance, at least until after death, a neglect which was not confined to\r\nthem, however: Berlioz shared the same fate. More than one French\r\ncomposer indeed has made his greatest success in Germany. Tributes of\r\nrespect and admiration were shown to his memory in both countries. His\r\nfuneral was attended by a great concourse of persons, and the pupils of\r\nthe Conservatory with which he had been identified so many years,\r\ncovered his grave with flowers. On the day of his interment memorial\r\nservices were held in many places in Germany and France at which public\r\naddresses were made. Méhul married a daughter of Dr. Gastoldi, but\r\nhaving no children adopted his nephew, M. Daussoigne, a young musician\r\nof excellent promise. His posthumous opera, “Valentine de Milan,” was\r\nfinished by the nephew and was performed in 1822, upon which occasion\r\nthe composer’s bust was publicly crowned. The popular success, indeed,\r\nwhich he achieved as a composer, was unquestionably expedited by his\r\nhigh character as a man. His uprightness and natural tenderness had\r\ncommended him to all the pupils of the Conservatory, and his strong\r\naffections did the same service for him with his friends. His generosity\r\nand benevolence were proverbial. The utter absence of jealousy in his\r\ndisposition especially commended him to musicians. He had a particular\r\nabhorrence of intrigue and of those small rivalries which were abundant\r\nat that time, and which sometimes developed into great wars, as has\r\nalready been hinted at in the reference to the famous struggle between\r\nthe factions of Gluck and Piccini, which not only enrolled musicians,\r\ncomposers and opera-goers in opposing ranks, but even brought courtiers,\r\nthe nobility and members of the royal family into fierce antagonism. In\r\nthe midst of all this small turbulence Méhul had carried himself with\r\neven poise, working for the best interest of his art and always true to\r\nits canons, though he made many tentative innovations when fortune\r\nfrowned upon him. At a time of more than ordinary dissipation and\r\nimmorality, he maintained the highest moral principles and a sterling\r\nmanhood. It was but natural, therefore, that such a man should have been\r\nmourned sincerely, and it may have added to public admiration that he\r\nhad reached his high distinction by his own efforts, rising from rude\r\nand obscure beginnings to the summit of European fame.\r\n\r\nMéhul was the legitimate successor of Gluck. It was that composer’s\r\n“Iphigénie,” as we have seen, that first caught his fancy, fired his\r\nambition and directed his attention to dramatic composition. It was\r\nowing to Gluck himself, who at once recognized the ability of the young\r\nmusician, that his feet were set in the right path, and it was to his\r\nadvice and instruction—the instruction of a friend rather than of a\r\nteacher—that he owed his discovery and appreciation of the dramatic\r\nquality of music. Other composers, among them Cherubini, had a certain\r\ninfluence upon him, but Gluck was the all in all of his system, the\r\nsource of his inspiration and the dominant element of his methods of\r\ntreatment. He clung to dramatic truth with as much tenacity as did the\r\ngreat author of “Orpheus” and the “Iphigénias” and strove with the same\r\nearnestness to make his music a close and perspicuous illustration of\r\nthe text, and to keep it elevated in style. Meanwhile his own nature was\r\nassisting him. Style and character are closely related, and Méhul’s\r\nmusic is a reflection of his own personal traits, namely, refinement of\r\nsentiment, seriousness and earnestness of presence, strong religious\r\ntendencies as shown in the opera—or shall we not call it oratorio—of\r\n“Joseph,” and nobility of character as shown in all his dramatic work.\r\nHis style is always elevated, though at times he made the effort to\r\nunite light and graceful melodies of the effervescent and short-lived\r\nsort which find so much favor on the French stage. He was not successful\r\nin these, however. He was more at home in passion and pathos, in strong,\r\nbroad motives, rich harmony and ingenious and elaborate accompaniments.\r\nIn a word, his standards, like those of Gluck, in whose steps he\r\nfollowed so closely, were classical and of the highest romantic type. At\r\ntimes he was daring and ingenious in his innovations, as in “Ariodant,”\r\nwhere four horns and three ’cellos carry on an animated conversation; in\r\n“Phrosine et Mélidore,” where four horns have a full part in the score;\r\nand in “Uthal,” where the violas are substituted for the violins, as\r\nalready has been mentioned. These, however, were only experiments,\r\nthough they serve to show his originality of conception as well as his\r\ncurious scholarship—a scholarship all the more remarkable when the\r\npoverty of his early training is considered. And yet he did more than\r\nalmost any other of his contemporaries to elevate the Opera Comique, and\r\nhas come down in musical history as one of the principal founders of the\r\nmodern French School.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile musical manuscript by Méhul, from Cherubini’s collection.\r\n\r\n  Méhul’s name, in upper left-hand corner, was written by Cherubini.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMéhul’s activity was almost incessant. He has left forty operas, of\r\nwhich the following are the more important: “Alonzo et Cora” and\r\n“Euphrosine et Coradin” (1790); “Stratonice” (1792); “Le jeune Sage et\r\nle vieux Fou” (1793); “Horatius Cocles,” “Arminius,” “Phrosine et\r\nMélidore” and “Scipion” (1794); “La Caverne,” “Tancrède et Chlorinde”\r\nand “Sesostris” (1795); “Le jeune Henri” and “Doria” (1797); “Adrien”\r\nand “Ariodant” (1799); “Epicure” (with Cherubini) and “Bion” (1800);\r\n“L’Irato” (1801); “Une Folie,” “Le Trésor Supposé,” “Joanne” and\r\n“L’Heureux malgré lui” (1802); “Helena” and “Le Baiser et la Quittance,”\r\nwith Kreutzer, Boieldieu and Nicolo (1803); “Uthal,” “Les deux Aveugles\r\nde Tolède” and “Gabrielle d’Estrées” (1806); “Joseph” (1807); “Les\r\nAmazones” (1811); “Le Prince Troubadour” (1813); “L’Oriflamme” with\r\nBerton, Kreutzer and Paer, (1814); “Le Journée aux Aventures” (1816);\r\nand the posthumous opera, “Valentine de Milan,” finished by his nephew,\r\nM. Daussoigne, and first performed in 1822. Besides these dramatic works\r\nhe has left four ballets, several symphonies, songs, operettas and\r\nincidental dramatic music to which reference has been made in the body\r\nof this article. Méhul’s literary ability, though never specially\r\ncultivated, was of a surprising kind, considering his early\r\ndisadvantages. He has left two reports which have been greatly\r\nadmired,—one upon the future state of music in France and the other upon\r\nthe labors of the pupils in the Conservatory. Taken all in all, he was\r\none of the most earnest, high-minded, conscientious and thoroughly\r\nartistic composers France has produced. He carried on the great work of\r\nGluck and is one of the important links in the evolution of music which\r\nled up to Richard Wagner and his music-dramas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Geo. P.

Dupré with the epigraph_ “_Virtute non\r\n    ambitu, laurum meruit._”\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                     LOUIS JOSEPH FERDINAND HÉROLD\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis Joseph Ferdinand Hérold, who played a conspicuous part in the\r\nelevation and enrichment of the opera comique, though now principally\r\nknown by only two of his many operas, “Zampa” and “Le Pré aux Clercs,”\r\nwas born at Paris, Jan. 28, 1791. His father, François Joseph, an\r\nAlsatian by birth, was a musician of more than ordinary ability. He had\r\nbeen a pupil of Philip Emmanuel Bach, was a professor of the piano, and\r\nalso composed music for that instrument. Little is known of the mother\r\nexcept that she sympathized with her son’s talent, which displayed\r\nitself at a very tender age, for in his sixth year the precocious boy\r\nwas writing little pieces for the piano. Upon the advice of Grétry, the\r\ncomposer, whom the parents consulted, he was sent to the Institution\r\nHix, where he had his first lessons in music. He made such rapid\r\nprogress that in 1806, the year in which his father died, he was\r\nencouraged by Fétis and other competent critics to make music his\r\nprofession. He entered the Conservatory in the same year as a member of\r\nthe piano class of Louis Adam, his godfather, and won his first honor by\r\ntaking the piano prize in 1810. He subsequently extended his curriculum,\r\nstudying harmony with Catel, the violin with Kreutzer, and composition\r\nwith Méhul, who years afterward said of him on his deathbed: “I can die\r\nnow that I know I leave a musician to France.” The success which marked\r\nhis career in the Conservatory is indicated by his securing the Prix de\r\nRome in 1812 with his cantata, “Mlle. de la Vallière.” The coveted honor\r\nopened wide the doors of music to him with the added advantages of\r\nforeign travel. The next two years were spent by the young musician in\r\nItaly, during which period there was a notable change in his style of\r\ncomposition. His first works were a hymn for four voices, two symphonies\r\nin C and D, and three quartets in D, C and G minor. The quality of these\r\nworks, which are now treasured in the Conservatory, gives ample promise\r\nthat he would have been a successful instrumental composer, but\r\ncircumstances ordered otherwise. During his stay in Naples he was\r\nattached to the court of Queen Caroline as pianist, and to please her\r\nmajesty he devoted himself to dramatic composition with an enthusiasm\r\nwhich soon aroused an ambition to excel in this class of writing. His\r\naspirations were still further heightened by the success of his first\r\ndramatic work, “La Jeunesse de Henri V,” produced in 1815, and to the\r\nopera he now devoted himself with an industry that never flagged. Well\r\nschooled and practiced as he might have been in instrumental writing, it\r\nevidently had limitations which were not agreeable to a composer of\r\nstrong emotions, vivid imagination and distinctly dramatic tendencies.\r\n\r\nHérold returned to Paris shortly after the successful production of his\r\nfirst opera, stopping en route in Vienna, where he made many musical\r\nacquaintances. Arrived at the French capital he at once made his\r\narrangements for an active and busy season of writing for the stage. His\r\nfirst concern was to find a libretto adapted to his purpose, and it was\r\nwhile engaged in this difficult search that good fortune came to him in\r\nthe request of Boieldieu that he would write the last half of an opera\r\nupon which he was then engaged, “Charles de France,” and which was\r\nbrought forward in June, 1816. Collaboration of this kind was far from\r\nbeing uncommon at that period, particularly in France. He not only wrote\r\n“Charles de France” with Boieldieu, but “Vendome en Espagne” with Auber,\r\nand “L’Auberge d’Auray” with Carafa, while in “La Marquise de\r\nBrinvilliers” no less than nine composers of prominence were\r\nrepresented—Hérold, Auber, Batton, Berton, Blangini, Boieldieu, Carafa,\r\nCherubini and Paër. The rage for collaboration also spread to literature\r\nand has been continued even into our time by Erckmann-Chatrian. The\r\nresults of such work are more tolerable however in literature than in\r\nmusic, where unity of style is one of the essentials. His association\r\nwith Boieldieu was of special advantage in introducing him to the\r\ntheatrical world of writers, and he soon was at no loss to find\r\nlibretti, good, bad and indifferent, many of them, it must be confessed,\r\nof the last two sorts. His first opera after the Boieldieu collaboration\r\nwas “Les Rosières,” in three acts, (1817), which proved to be a success.\r\nFlushed with the prestige of this work the young composer immediately\r\nset about another, and before the year closed had finished “La\r\nClochette,” which not only was successful, but as its fresh and taking\r\nairs caught the popular fancy, at once made him a favorite in the gay\r\ncity. His industry now became prodigious. He was seized with the very\r\ndemon of work and while in this mood he eagerly accepted everything that\r\nwas offered him in the way of a libretto as affording a new outlet for\r\nhis musical activity. The result was detrimental. Year after year he\r\nproduced operas for the stage, some of which had but one or two\r\nhearings, while others were vigorously hissed, not on account of the\r\nmusic, but by reason of the weakness and commonplaceness of the stories\r\nand their utter lack of dramatic merit. Among such operas were “Le\r\npremier Venu” (1818); “Les Troqueurs” (1819); “L’Auteur mort et vivant”\r\n(1820); “Lasthénie” (1823); and “Le Lapin Blanc” (1825). Now and then,\r\nhowever, an opera was produced which made compensation for so many\r\nfailures, and among these was “Le Muletier” (1823), which was highly\r\nesteemed, especially by those whose opinions were of value. In fact\r\nHérold had no idle moments. During all of this period, and for two or\r\nthree years later (1820–29), he was actively connected with the stage.\r\nIn 1820 he accepted the position of piano accompanist for the Italian\r\nOpera and held it for seven years. In 1821 he was dispatched to Italy\r\nwith a commission to engage artists, and from 1827 to 1829 was chorus\r\nmaster at the Académie de Musique. All this was practical experience of\r\na valuable kind in the accessories and environments of his profession,\r\nand undoubtedly contributed many of the elements which led up to his\r\nultimate success as an operatic composer by giving him a knowledge of\r\nthe details of the stage, the habits and peculiarities of singers, and\r\nthe limitations of the dramatic art which are so essential to the\r\ncomplete equipment of the composer. During a portion of this period he\r\nturned to other forms of composition. In 1827, he devoted himself to\r\nballets. Of these, “Astolphe et Joconde,” “La Sonnambule,” “La Fille mal\r\ngardée,” “La Belle au bois dormant” and “Sylvie” are the most\r\nconspicuous. All of them are characterized by the same graceful and\r\nromantic style which is to be found so often in his operas. During this\r\nsame period he wrote a voluminous amount of piano music, such as\r\nsonatas, caprices, rondos, fantasies, divertissements and variations,\r\nthe most notable being a sonata in A flat, the “L’Amante disperato”\r\nsonata, the Rondo Dramatique, the “Pulcinella” caprice, variations on\r\n“Au clair de la lune,” “Marlbrook,” an arrangement of the “Moses in\r\nEgypt” of Rossini, whose music largely influenced his style, and\r\nincidental music to the drama of “Missolonghi,” which was produced at\r\nthe Odeon. A letter written by his friend Chanlieu refers to this\r\nperiod. In speaking of the failure of some of his operas, M. Chanlieu\r\nsays: “How many times in our solitary walks he lamented lost time and\r\nforced inaction! Disgust mastered him and made itself felt even in his\r\npiano music which, with the exception of two or three other works, was a\r\nspecies of current money to which he attached no value. It was, however,\r\nat that time that he wrote his fantasias on themes by Rossini, which had\r\na great sale and at which he was the first to laugh. The spirit of youth\r\nstill sustained him; he was gay and vivacious in private, but in public\r\nmorose and caustic.” Rossini not alone influenced his musical style. It\r\nwas through his courteous and kindly offices that Hérold received the\r\ndecoration of the Legion of Honor, Rossini going so far even as to\r\nrefuse it for himself unless it were also awarded to his friend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BUST OF HÉROLD.\r\n\r\n  Reproduction of a proof before letters of an etching.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo return to his operatic compositions, there were some others during\r\nthis gloomy period of frequent failures which achieved success, among\r\nthem, “Vendome en Espagne” (1823), which he wrote with Auber, “Le Roi\r\nRéné” composed for the fête of Louis XVIII., “Marie” (1826) and\r\n“L’Illusion” (1829), which enhanced his reputation and paved the way for\r\nthe two works which were to be the crowning successes of his life.\r\n“Zampa” was produced May 3, 1831, and aroused something like a furor in\r\nParis, though its most enduring success has been made in Germany. It\r\nstill keeps the boards upon the continent, and though rarely heard in\r\nthis country, its overture remains a conspicuous feature of concert\r\nprogrammes. With “Zampa” Hérold’s success was firmly grounded, though\r\nthe work bears unmistakable indications of German influence and is\r\nwritten in the broad, serious style characteristic of the German\r\ncomposers. It is for this reason that it has been more favorably\r\nreceived in Germany than in France, though its merit was fully\r\nrecognized by Hérold’s own countrymen. It restored the waning fortunes\r\nof the Opera Comique, saved it from ruin, and made Hérold a popular\r\nfavorite. At this time he was chorus master, but a few weeks after his\r\nsuccess he was dismissed by the new director upon the excuse that it was\r\nnecessary to retrench. He had only a verbal contract, but he appealed to\r\nthe courts, and his appeal was sustained after nine months of\r\nlitigation, the courts holding that there was an implied contract. He\r\naccordingly was reinstated, but soon the fortunes of the Opera were\r\ninvolved in another financial crisis. The director sought to retrieve\r\nthem with a sensation and in 1831 brought out the musical play of the\r\n“Marquise de Brinvilliers.” Scribe and Castil-Blaze wrote the text\r\ntogether, and nine composers, whose names have been given elsewhere,\r\narranged the musical setting. The combined efforts of the collaborators,\r\nhowever, failed to produce anything more than a nine days’ wonder, and\r\nthe doors of the Opera were reluctantly closed. Six months later a new\r\nlocation was chosen and the opera once more made its appeal to the\r\npublic with a new work by Hérold, “La Médecine sans Médecin.” Its\r\nsuccess fell far short of that which “Zampa” had enjoyed, but it served\r\nthe purpose of keeping the Opera on its feet until Hérold had finished\r\nanother work which was destined to complete his fame and to restore the\r\nOpera Comique to its old prestige. It was, alas, his swan song. “Le Pré\r\naux Clercs” was performed Dec. 15, 1832. It had a success of enthusiasm.\r\nUnlike “Zampa,” it was a purely national opera, with an historical theme\r\ntreated with genuine French grace and spirit, and abounding in\r\ncharacteristic French music which commended it to the Parisians. Its\r\nreception was attended with a remarkable display of excitement and\r\npopular acclamations. The audience rose to a man and called for the\r\ncomposer but he was unable to make an appearance. The fatigues of\r\nrehearsals and the tumultuous events of the evening were too much for\r\nhis already enfeebled condition. He was taken home, but had hardly\r\narrived there when he had a dangerous hemorrhage. He lived but four\r\nweeks after his great success, dying of consumption Jan. 19, 1833, the\r\nsame disease which had proved fatal in his father’s case. His funeral\r\ntook place on the 21st. He was buried at Père la Chaise, near Méhul, and\r\naddresses were made at the grave by Fétis and Saint-George. He left a\r\nwidow, Adèle Elise Rollet-Hérold, to whom he was married in 1827, and\r\nthree children, Ferdinand, an attorney, Adèle, and Eugenie who also was\r\na musician. “Le Pré aux Clercs” was not his last work in the list of\r\nperformances, for after his death the overture and four numbers of\r\nanother opera, “Ludovic,” were found among his papers. The work was\r\ncompleted and produced with success by Halévy. His biographer, M.\r\nJouvin, says of it: “In what proportion did this posthumous child of\r\nHérold belong to its father and its godfather? I know not. I have not\r\nthe opera of ‘Ludovic’ under my eye. I have not been admitted into the\r\nsecret of the work done by the musician who two years later wrote ‘La\r\nJuive’ and ‘L’Eclair’ without taking breath. I only charge myself to\r\nreport, without guaranteeing, a tradition which attributes to Hérold the\r\noverture and four pieces in the first act of this lyric drama.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HÉROLD’S TOMB IN PÈRE LA CHAISE, PARIS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of Hérold’s style which distinguished him from the\r\nother operatic composers of his period were the freshness and\r\noriginality of his ideas, the grace and refinement of his conceptions,\r\nwhich are displayed to special advantage in his ballets, the variety of\r\nhis melodies, and the highly emotional and imaginative character of the\r\nman himself. He was the legitimate successor of Boieldieu and reflected\r\nhis romantic moods, and it will be remembered coöperated with him in his\r\nfirst work after his return to Paris from Italy. With these purely\r\nsubjective qualities he combined an instrumentation that is always rich\r\nin color and dramatic in effect, an intimate knowledge of the stage and\r\nits resources, and a superior degree of literary taste and culture,\r\nthough the latter distinction did not always save him from accepting\r\ncommonplace and sometimes worthless libretti. The reason for this is\r\nprobably to be found in his prodigious activity, which induced him to\r\naccept such poor books in the hope that his music would excuse them,\r\nrather than spend his time in idleness. Though possessed of undoubted\r\noriginality if not of actual inspiration, he was greatly influenced by\r\nthe works of the composers, though in no sense can he be considered a\r\ncopyist. During his Italian visit he was much impressed with Paisiello.\r\nIn a letter to his mother about the year 1815 he says: “I have fallen\r\ninto one error here—that of neglecting M. Paisiello.... I can say that I\r\nstudy much the music of Paisiello and find it delicious.” The Italian\r\ninfluences did not last long however. Upon his return to Paris he was\r\ndevoted to the music of Méhul, with whom he had studied in the\r\nConservatory. Rossini influenced him greatly for a time and how far he\r\nhad studied Mozart is shown in “Zampa,” which was constructed upon the\r\nlines of “Don Juan.” In this connection, M. Scudo, in his criticism of\r\n“Zampa,” makes the following pertinent remarks: “The side of this work\r\nthat stands open to criticism is, as nearly always with Hérold,\r\nconfusion of styles. The austere and sober phrase of Méhul is found in\r\ncompany with Italian bravura. The chansonette disperses with its\r\nimportunate cockcrow all the phantoms worked from the supernatural.\r\nMozart, Méhul, Weber, Rossini, Auber, how many more?—may be found in the\r\nhybrid formation of this superb monster. Under the mobile structure of\r\nthat orchestra, so full of presentiments and mysteries, you distinguish\r\nWeber. Those duets, those Venetian colored finales, conceived, worked\r\nwith the vigorous authority of a master, speak to you of Rossini, while\r\nhere and there the small details, the grace, the spirit, the lively and\r\npiquant features murmur in your ears the names of Boieldieu and Auber.”\r\nHis own thoughts which he committed to paper, however, and which were\r\nfound among his documents after his death, will give a clue to his style\r\nand to his ideas of what constituted artistic excellence. Among many\r\nother things he says: “Melodies must come from the soul to reach the\r\nsoul of the auditors.” “Try to find a just medium between the vague\r\nmusic of Sacchini and the vigor of Gluck. Think often of Mozart and his\r\nbeautiful _airs de mouvement_.” “Lean always to the side of melodies\r\nfree from platitude.” “In all arts, and particularly in music for some\r\ntime past, people are skilful in finishing and polishing without\r\nreflecting how much more important is a good general design.” “Of melody\r\nas much as possible.” “Declaim with truth and strength.” “Find themes\r\nwhich bring tears.” “‘Great sorrows are silent’ observed Seneca. Thus\r\nHero seeing the floating corpse of Leander held her peace. He who goes\r\nto the Opera only to hear the music had better frequent the\r\nconcert-room. The musical tragedian ought above all to sing but ever in\r\nagreement with the situation.” And then, as if to answer the comments of\r\nsome of his critics: “Why not use several styles in a great work? A\r\nchief priest can sing in the ancient manner, the others in the modern.”\r\n“Church music ought to pray for those who listen to it, as said\r\nSalieri.” M. Gustave Chouquet, the keeper of the Museum of the Paris\r\nConservatory, has well summed up the characteristics of Hérold in his\r\nanalysis of “Zampa”: “In a word we recognize in ‘Zampa’ the hand of a\r\nmaster, who to the spirit of Italian music unites the depth of the\r\nGerman and the elegance of the French School.”\r\n\r\nThe principal works of Hérold include twenty-two operas, one cantata,\r\nfive ballets, three sonatas, three string quartets, two symphonies,\r\nseven caprices, seventeen rondos and divertissements, seven fantasies\r\nand three variations. Of the operas the following have been the most\r\nsuccessful: “La jeunesse de Henri V.” (1815); “Charles de France”\r\n(1816); “Les Rosières” (1817); “La Clochette” (1817); “Le Muletier”\r\n(1823); “Vendome en Espagne” (1823); “Marie” (1826); “L’lllusion”\r\n(1829); “Zampa” (1831); “La Médecine sans Médecin” (1832) and “Le Pré\r\naux Clercs” (1832). Though none of these works can be called familiar in\r\nthis country, it can hardly be doubted that the two operas “Zampa” and\r\n“Le Pré aux Clercs,” which saved the Opera Comique, and which paved the\r\nway for Ambroise Thomas, Bizet, Massenet and the modern French school,\r\nwould repay revival and achieve fresh popularity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Geo.

Uniformly harmonious, with but an occasional musical\r\ndissonance, the symphony of his life led up to its dramatic climax when\r\nthe dying composer lay surrounded by the turmoil and carnage of the\r\nParis Commune. Such is the picture we draw of the existence of this\r\nFrench composer, in whose garden of life there grew only roses without\r\nthorns; whose long and glorious career as a composer ended only with his\r\nlife; who felt that he had not lived long enough, and who clung\r\ntenaciously to life, energetically refusing to drop this mantle of\r\nmortality, postponing the final moment by the mere strength of his\r\npowerful determination to live.\r\n\r\nAuber, the most Parisian of Parisians, who could never tear himself away\r\nfrom his dear native city, even for a short excursion in the summer, was\r\nborn,—as it happened—at Caen, towards the end of the month of January,\r\n1782. I say, “as it happened,” because the composer’s parents were not\r\nsettled in that town and were only staying there temporarily when the\r\nfuture author of “La Muette de Portici” made his entrance upon the stage\r\nof life. His father was a print-seller in Paris. Being a thorough\r\nbusiness man he wished his son to become a business man also. To this\r\nend, when his child had received a somewhat summary education, and had\r\nalmost reached man’s estate, he sent him to London to begin his career\r\nin a house of business.\r\n\r\nEven at this early period the young Auber was considered a distinguished\r\namateur musician. He played the piano well, and had made successful\r\nattempts at minor composition, such as ballads, small morceaux for the\r\npiano, etc. Realizing that he was not fitted for a business life, but\r\nfor that of a musician, Auber returned to Paris, where he was not long\r\nin making for himself a reputation in the fashionable world. He was\r\nlooked upon as an agreeable pianist and a graceful composer, with\r\nsparkling and original ideas. He pleased the ladies by his\r\nirreproachable gallantry and the sterner sex by his wit and vivacity.\r\nDuring this early period of his life Auber produced a number of\r\n_lieder_, serenade duets, and pieces of drawing-room music, including a\r\ntrio for the piano, violin and violoncello, which was considered\r\ncharming by the indulgent and easy-going audience who heard it.\r\nEncouraged by this success, he wrote a more important work, a concerto\r\nfor violins with orchestra, which was executed by the celebrated Mazas\r\nat one of the Conservatoire concerts. He also composed, for his friend\r\nLamare, concertos which were applauded by the general public. This\r\nLamare was a violoncellist of great talent and erudition, but so barren\r\nof musical creative power that he could not originate the simplest\r\nmelody nor compose a note for his own instrument. Auber adapted his\r\nmusic so cleverly to the playing of the eminent instrumentalist that\r\nLamare said to him: “Nobody would think, my dear Auber, that I was not\r\nthe composer of these concertos, so strongly are they impressed with my\r\npersonality.” To which Auber replied: “Since that is so, my dear Lamare,\r\nthe concertos shall be published in your name.” And as a matter of fact\r\nthey were so published, successively, under the name of the\r\nvioloncellist. The public thought he was the author of them, but\r\nmusicians were aware of the truth, which has been an open secret for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that although Auber made his début as a dramatic composer\r\nat a late period, he early practised this art as an amateur, producing\r\nhis compositions in the Paris drawing-rooms. These drawing-rooms were\r\nhis academy of music up to the time when, convinced that he had still\r\nmuch to learn in the practice of counterpoint, he sought assistance from\r\nthe illustrious Cherubini, whom he was destined one day to succeed as\r\ndirector of the Paris Conservatoire.\r\n\r\nThe first work that Auber submitted to public judgment was a comic opera\r\nin one act, entitled “Le Séjour Militaire,” which was produced at the\r\nThéâtre Feydeau in 1813. Auber was then thirty-two years old. This piece\r\nwas not his first attempt in theatrical work, however; for he had\r\npreviously written a comic opera for the Prince de Chimay, and before\r\nthis, still another work for a small orchestra, which was represented in\r\nan amateur theatre. He had also composed a Mass, with orchestra, in\r\nwhich occurred the admirable chant which he used at a later date in the\r\nfamous prayer in his masterpiece, “La Muette de Portici.” “Le Séjour\r\nMilitaire” may be regarded merely as marking a date in the biography of\r\nthe French composer. This piece, of somewhat doubtful buffoonery, passed\r\nunnoticed by the general public. Indeed the musician himself was very\r\nslightly impressed with it, being but imperfectly inspired when he wrote\r\nit. Nevertheless a writer then celebrated, M. Martinville, discovered in\r\nthis score several pretty _motifs_ and a great deal of wit.\r\n\r\nFrom 1813 to 1819 Auber remained silent, and it might have been thought\r\nthat he had ceased to exist. What became of him during this long period?\r\nHe still continued to appear in society and, when in the humor, to write\r\nas an amateur fugitive pieces of music set to subjects of the same\r\ncharacter. He asked dramatic poets to write pieces for him, but they\r\nwere not very anxious to do so after the failure of “Le Séjour\r\nMilitaire.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time the composer’s father died, leaving a widow and two sons\r\nwithout fortune. During this period, when the eminent musician that was\r\nto be was still pursuing his studies, he found himself face to face with\r\npecuniary difficulties; but he supported them bravely, never\r\ncomplaining.\r\n\r\nPlanard, the most fashionable librettist of that day, was accustomed to\r\ngather around him in his little house at Passy—which was not then\r\nconsidered one of the districts of Paris—a company of amateurs and\r\nartists. There was music, and Auber, one of the most assiduous habitués\r\nof the house, accompanied on the piano. In this way it came to pass that\r\nMadame Planard took a great interest in Auber and espoused his cause.\r\n\r\n“My dear,” she said to her husband, “can you not entrust one of your\r\npoems to poor Auber, who is so well-bred, so witty, and so good an\r\naccompanist? I am convinced that he will earn himself a name among our\r\ncomposers. It is a pity that he should compose operatic airs without\r\nwords because he has none to work on.”\r\n\r\nWomen always gain the day, whenever they plead in favor of the unknown\r\nand the lowly, and Auber was then both unknown and lowly. Madame Planard\r\npleaded so well in this particular instance that her protégé obtained\r\nfrom Planard two pieces instead of one to set to music. The first was a\r\npiece in one act, entitled “Le Testament et le Billet Doux,” which\r\nunfortunately met with a much less favorable reception from the public\r\nthan “Le Séjour Militaire,” and that had been a failure. The next\r\nventure was “La Bergère Châtelaine,” in three acts, and it made ample\r\namends for all previous mortifications. Its success was unanimous and\r\nbrilliant. None too soon indeed. Had the author lost this opportunity\r\nhis future as a composer would have been irretrievably ruined, for no\r\npoet would have entrusted him with a libretto.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Auber produced “La Bergère Châtelaine,” the\r\nturning-point in his artistic career, he was thirty-eight years of age,\r\njust a year younger than Rossini when he closed his with that immortal\r\nmasterpiece “Guillaume Tell.”\r\n\r\nPlanard, having witnessed the failure of “Le Testament,” would have\r\nliked to take back the libretto of “La Bergère Châtelaine” which he had\r\nhanded over to Auber some time before. But now he was very happy to have\r\nanother of his pieces, in three acts, entitled “Emma,” set to music by\r\nthe composer. This work was represented at the Théâtre Feydeau in 1821,\r\nand was an extraordinary success. The high road to fortune was now open,\r\nand for more than forty years the composer’s career was one long series\r\nof triumphs, which continued to the last day of his life. One might have\r\nthought, after the complete success of the two last comic operas upon\r\nwhich Auber and Planard collaborated, that they would have continued to\r\nwork together for a long time; but it was not so. Scribe had just then\r\nattained his brilliant position as a writer of vaudevilles. Fate had\r\ndecided that there should be a partnership between him and Auber, a\r\npartnership which of all the combinations that ever existed between\r\nword-writer and musician was the happiest and most lasting.\r\n\r\nWhat was the secret of the union of these two minds, these two talented\r\nbeings who were so well constituted to understand each other that they\r\nseem to have been born the one for the other, to work together for their\r\ncommon glory and to the great delight of the public who applauded them\r\nso well? It was in this wise.\r\n\r\nA vaudeville by Scribe had just been accepted at the Théâtre de Madame,\r\nwhich he rightly expected would meet with success. For a certain morceau\r\nto be sung during the progress of the play he thought that the air of\r\nthe round in “La Bergère Châtelaine” was wonderfully well adapted.\r\nAlthough he had never yet had an opportunity of seeing Auber, Scribe did\r\nnot on that account hesitate to write to him. This historic letter and\r\nAuber’s reply to it have been preserved, and they are too interesting\r\nnot to be reproduced here, the more so as they are comparatively\r\nunknown. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n“TO MONSIEUR AUBER:—\r\n\r\n“Will you kindly permit me, Sir, to place in a vaudeville which I am\r\njust now writing for the Théâtre de Madame, your round from ‘La Bergère\r\nChâtelaine’ which is so delightful and justly popular? I will not\r\nconceal from you, Sir, that I have promised my director to make the\r\npiece succeed, and that I have counted upon using your charming music.”\r\n\r\nThis note is quite gallant, but Auber replies to it with just as much\r\ngallantry:\r\n\r\n“TO MONSIEUR SCRIBE:—\r\n\r\n“My round is but a trifle, Sir, and you are so gifted that you can\r\ndispense with my poor assistance. However, if I grant you what you ask,\r\nalthough you do not really need it, and you will allow me to lend you at\r\nthe same time the fine voice and pretty face of Mme. Boulanger, I think\r\nwe should both do a good stroke of business.”\r\n\r\nThe good stroke of business consisted in the thrice-happy collaboration\r\nwhich resulted from this exchange of letters, a collaboration only\r\nbroken by the death of Scribe, which took place many years before that\r\nof Auber. On one occasion Auber said to me: “I owe my successes to\r\nScribe. Without his assistance I feel that I should never have obtained\r\nthe place I occupy in the musical world.” Without detracting in any\r\ndegree from the value of Auber’s music, it may be said that this\r\nstatement is true; for the composer needed a librettist of such\r\nversatile wit and resource of imagination that I do not see amongst the\r\ncomic-opera librettists a single poet who could have taken Scribe’s\r\nplace in this work. During the whole of his life Auber was accustomed to\r\ncompose the principal airs of his operas before the libretto was written\r\nand almost without regard to the character of the scene in which these\r\nairs would be used; and to these melodies Scribe wrote words with\r\nextraordinary ease. Auber sang the airs, accompanying himself on the\r\npiano, while Scribe, pencil in hand, instantly found the verses\r\nnaturally suited to the character of the music, cleverly adapting\r\nhimself to its rhythm, oftentimes very strange. I may mention the\r\n“Seguidille” in “Le Domino Noir,” which was a singularly difficult test\r\nof Scribe’s powers. Another instance is the song of Henriette in\r\n“L’Ambassadrice,” which was also written by Auber without words. It was\r\nan astonishing feat on the part of Scribe to find the comic and original\r\nverses which he adapted to this melody, the scansion of which is so very\r\nsingular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARICATURE OF AUBER.\r\n\r\n  From the Paris Charivari.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BUST OF AUBER.\r\n\r\n  By Danton; in the Carnavalet Museum, Paris.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was on horseback or while riding in his carriage during his daily\r\nexcursions to the Bois de Boulogne that Auber found his happiest\r\n_motifs_. On returning home he set them to music and inserted them in\r\nthe opera upon which he was working, and then Scribe supplied the words.\r\nIn the principal scenes, however, Auber wrote to the verses of his\r\ncollaborator, and he would begin to work on his return from the theatre,\r\nwhither he went nearly every evening. In this way he would write on a\r\nlittle table by the side of his piano up to four or five o’clock in the\r\nmorning. As often as not, he did not go to bed, but slept in his\r\narm-chair. Many of his scores bear traces of the ink which dropped from\r\nhis pen as he let it fall from his hand when overcome by slumber. The\r\nmanual of his old square piano bears numerous inkstains on the white\r\nkeys of the upper octave, which indicate the moment when Auber fell\r\nasleep at his work. The musician never needed more than from three to\r\nfour hours of sleep daily, and throughout his life he took only one meal\r\nin twenty-four hours, namely, dinner. On rising, he would drink a cup of\r\ncamomile, which he swallowed fasting. This was sufficient to sustain him\r\nwithout undue fatigue to the digestive organs up to the time of his only\r\nmeal at six o’clock. He frequently invited to his table, frugal as it\r\nwas, young professional lady singers, for he was extremely susceptible\r\nto the attractions of the fair sex, and remained a worshipper of beauty\r\neven unto death. Venus was his goddess, and he ever adored her most\r\nconscientiously.\r\n\r\nAuber had eight domestics in his service, and never was man worse served\r\nthan he. One evening he invited to dinner several professional ladies,\r\nas also the learned Mr. Weckerlin, librarian of the Conservatoire. The\r\ndinner was good and well served. Music and song followed the repast. One\r\nof the ladies being thirsty, the master rang for a glass of water. There\r\nwas no answer. The housekeeper, the old Sophie, whose face had been\r\nfamiliar for half a century to all Auber’s friends, had gone to bed; the\r\ncook had followed her example; the valet-de-chambre had gone out for a\r\nwalk with John, the English coachman, who remained more than thirty\r\nyears in the composer’s service: in short, all the servants had\r\ndisappeared. Auber did not fall into a passion: he never became angry at\r\nanything. “As we cannot get anything here,” said he to his guests, “let\r\nus go and take an ice at Tortoni’s.”\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the numerous inkstains on the old piano,\r\nmade by the pen which fell from Auber’s hand as sleep overpowered him\r\nduring his long nocturnal labors, and we now propose to give some\r\ndetails of this interesting and historic instrument, which remains an\r\nobject of curiosity to all the admirers of the master who visit the\r\ninstrumental museum at the Conservatoire, and of which we have been able\r\nto take a photograph by the gracious permission of M. Pillaut, the\r\nlearned Conservator of the Museum.\r\n\r\nThis piano, oblong in form, very light and built of mahogany, was bought\r\nby Auber on the 17th of February, 1812, in the showrooms of the\r\ncelebrated Erard. The manufacturer’s number is 8414. It is a\r\ndouble-stringed instrument, and its compass is only five and a half\r\noctaves. When, in 1842, Auber succeeded Cherubini as director of the\r\nConservatoire, he had this piano brought thither and placed it in his\r\nstudy. It was upon this instrument, from which the master could never be\r\nseparated, and which had become his true friend and harmonious\r\nconfidant, an indefatigable and never-failing source of inspiration,\r\nthat Auber composed those charming and _spirituel_ comedies which, so\r\noften performed and always with success, have remained models of French\r\ncomic opera in common with the works of Monsigny, Dalayrac, Grétry,\r\nBoïeldieu, Hérold, and other great masters.\r\n\r\nBesides the old piano which stood in his private room at the\r\nConservatoire, Auber had another at home, in his house in the Rue St.\r\nGeorges. This latter was an upright piano which I have often seen. Like\r\nhis oblong piano, it was stained with ink on the two upper octaves.\r\nAuber never thought, like Ambroise Thomas and Charles Gounod, of having\r\nmade by the firm of Pleyel what is called a composer’s piano, which is\r\nboth an excellent instrument and a secretary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AUBER’S PIANO AT THE PARIS CONSERVATOIRE MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n  Reproduced from a photograph made by special permission.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAuber once related to me that two days before the first performance of\r\n“La Muette” (which he completed in three months!) the overture was not\r\nyet ready. He composed it with all the fervor which comes of\r\nimprovisation. The evening before the first production the orchestra\r\nrehearsed it for the first time, and the musicians accorded this\r\ninstrumental preface an enthusiastic reception. On the first night the\r\npublic were so enchanted with it that it received a double _encore_. I\r\nhave never seen this fact mentioned in any of the biographies of the\r\nillustrious composer, but I learnt it from Auber himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AUBER’S RESIDENCE IN PARIS.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph.\r\n\r\n  In this house Auber lived for forty years, and it was here that he\r\n    died in May, 1871, during the battle with the Paris Commune.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt has been a matter of astonishment that this French musician, who did\r\nnot know Italy, who never left Paris—with the exception of a journey to\r\nLondon when he was a very young man—should have been able to introduce\r\ninto “La Muette” so much of Italian local color, and assimilate in so\r\nwonderful a manner the musical genius of the Neapolitans. We are in\r\nimagination as thoroughly in Naples as it is possible to be without\r\nactually being there, the moment we hear that victorious march, so full\r\nof freedom, rhythm and melody, and see on the stage the crowd of\r\ntriumphant lazzaroni now masters of the land. One would gladly learn in\r\nwhat circumstances this beautiful and marvellously characteristic air\r\ncame into the mind of the Parisian composer. Jouvin will tell us, and he\r\nhas made no mistake, for this curious information reached him from the\r\nlips of the composer himself: “Would you know where the composer found\r\nthe _motif_ of this march, the melody of which is so free and\r\nunconventional? He found it in a shaving dish! It was when he was\r\nshaving himself, with his face covered with soap, that there came upon\r\nhim the rhythm and melody of this inspiration; and he seized and secured\r\nit before it was lost. Such is the origin of the inspiration which twice\r\nin the overture and at the end of the fourth act, so powerfully appeals\r\nto the spectator in the auditorium. O Genius, behold thy handiwork! Have\r\nnot sixty winners of the grand Prix de Rome passed no inconsiderable\r\ntime seeking inspiration in the land of classic song and returned home\r\nwithout a single idea? M. Auber, who could never tear himself away from\r\nParis, discovers the sky of Naples in the lather at the bottom of a\r\nbasin!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AUBER’S TOMB IN PÈRE LACHAISE, PARIS.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary effort made by Auber in the composition of “La\r\nMuette,” in less time than would have been needed by a copyist to\r\ntranscribe this voluminous score, completely deprived him of his mental\r\npowers for the moment, and he was obliged to take absolute rest for some\r\ntime. His ideas were exhausted, and he would have found it impossible\r\neven to find a melody for a simple song. He thought that the fountain of\r\nmusical invention was dried up within him, and for all time. But his\r\nfaculties, thank God, were not extinguished, and there yet remained in\r\nthe composer’s brain living fountains from whence were to gush forth his\r\nbest, his most characteristic works, and those which are most strongly\r\nimpressed with the author’s style and personality.\r\n\r\nIn many respects, Auber was not an irreproachable director of the\r\nConservatoire, where he remained, however, a number of years. He was all\r\nhis life too fashionable a man, too kind, too weak to direct with the\r\nnecessary firmness a school so difficult to govern as the Ecole\r\nNationale de Musique et de Déclamation of Paris. He attempted no\r\nimprovements in the arrangement of the studies, and while all public\r\ninstitutions throughout France were being modified in accordance with\r\nprogressive ideas, the Conservatoire alone remained stationary and, as\r\nit were, fossilized in its ancient condition. Ultimately the\r\nAdministration des Beaux-Arts became alarmed at this state of things,\r\nand on the 2d of April, 1870, the following order was issued:—\r\n\r\n“In the name of the Emperor, the Minister of Fine Arts issues the\r\nfollowing order:\r\n\r\n“Art. 1. A committee is hereby formed the mission of which shall be to\r\nrevise the present government of the Conservatoire, and to consider and\r\npropose such modifications as may be made, especially in regard to the\r\nteaching in this institution, so that the studies pursued there may be\r\nmade as profitable as possible.\r\n\r\n“Art. 2. This committee, which shall sit under the presidency of the\r\nMinister of Fine Arts, shall be constituted as follows:\r\n\r\n“MM. Auber, Emile Augier, Edmond About, Azévédo, Chaix d’Estange, de\r\nCharnacé, Oscar Comettant, Félicien David, Camille Doucet, Théophile\r\nGautier, Gevaert, Charles Gounod, Guiroult, Jouvin, Ernest Legouvé,\r\nNogent-Saint-Laurens, Emile Perrin, Prince Poniatowski, H. Prévost,\r\nReber, Ernest Reyer, de Saint-Georges, de Saint-Valry, Albéric Second,\r\nEdouard Thierry, Ambroise Thomas, J. Weiss.”\r\n\r\nThe sittings of this committee were of a most interesting character.\r\nAuber, then eighty-eight years of age, was never absent from any of\r\nthem; but he remained silent all the while. It seemed as though he were\r\nthere in the presence of judges rather than before a committee in which\r\nhe had full and complete liberty of discussion. Of all the propositions\r\nmade by the committee only one was ever put into execution, by Ambroise\r\nThomas, who succeeded Auber as director of the Ecole Nationale de\r\nMusique et de Déclamation of Paris. This proposition was that Sol-fa\r\nclasses should be established especially for the pupils of both sexes in\r\nthe singing classes.\r\n\r\nAuber was Maître-de-chapelle to the Emperor Napoleon III. He was a Grand\r\nOfficer of the Legion of Honor, and he received a number of foreign\r\ndecorations. He never married.\r\n\r\nIt was Auber’s misfortune to see the siege of Paris and the terrible\r\ndeeds of the Commune. At that time he had two horses to which he was\r\nvery much attached, named Figaro and Almaviva. When famine began to\r\nstalk through the land he was called upon to give up the first-named\r\nanimal to be used as food. The other met with perhaps a still more cruel\r\nfate, for it was taken from the elegant coupé of the composer to draw a\r\ncart at St. Denis. In the midst of the successive misfortunes which\r\nbefell his beloved city of Paris, Auber became deeply downcast. His\r\nstrength rapidly ebbed away, and after a terrible struggle lasting\r\nseveral days, during which he fought desperately with death—for he still\r\nclung tenaciously to life,—he breathed his last, cared for in turn by\r\nAmbroise Thomas, Marmontel and Weckerlin, on the 12th of May, 1871. When\r\npublic order had been re-established, he was accorded a solemn public\r\nfuneral on the 15th of July following.\r\n\r\nAuber’s labors were devoted to one long series of sparkling comic operas\r\ndue to the happy partnership of Scribe and Auber, a partnership in which\r\nMélesville was often associated. The first comic opera produced by the\r\ntriple partnership was “Leicester,” the subject of which was taken by\r\nthe authors from Sir Walter Scott’s romance, “Kenilworth.” Although,\r\nfrom the character of the dramatis personæ, “Leicester,” was somewhat\r\nremarkable compared with the plays usually produced at the Théâtre\r\nFeydeau, it was nevertheless well received by the public.\r\n\r\nAfter this came “La Neige,” a pretty score which, however, the critics\r\n(who in those days were generally literary men not at all competent to\r\njudge of musical matters) declared bore some resemblance to the work of\r\nRossini. But at that time what musician was there who could entirely\r\nwithstand Rossini’s style, which had conquered the universe, not even\r\nexcepting Germany?\r\n\r\n“La Neige” was succeeded by “Le Maçon,” in which there occur at least\r\ntwo or three morceaux that are marvels of wit and grace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph musical manuscript by Daniel François Auber.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph letters from Auber to Alfred de Beauchesne,\r\n    Secretary of the Conservatoire.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Le Maçon” was followed by “Le Timide,” “Fiorella,” “La Muette de\r\nPortici,” a grand opera in five acts, produced by Scribe and Casimir\r\nDelavigne, which was represented at the Académie de Musique on the 19th\r\nof February, 1828. It had considerable success the first night and the\r\nsucceeding representations only strengthened the good opinion formed of\r\nit. After more than sixty years and in spite of certain features which\r\nare now looked upon as old-fashioned, as well as an orchestration which\r\nwould better suit present ideas were it more powerful and contrapuntal,\r\nat least in certain parts of the score, this admirable work would still\r\nbe quite presentable anywhere. The impartial public, which does not\r\nyield to the influence of schools of music and does not hide its\r\nimpressions, would still warmly applaud in this rich treasury of sweet\r\nmelody the chorus, “O Dieu puissant”; the barcarolle, “Amis, la matinée\r\nest belle”; the duet by the two men, “Amour Sacré de la Patrie”; the\r\nmarket scene; the beautiful and impressive prayer; the delicious air of\r\n“Sleep”; the air sung by the woman in the fourth act, “Arbitre d’une\r\nVie,” which has become classical; and that other barcarolle, “Voyez du\r\nhaut de ce rivage”; the tarantella, etc.\r\n\r\nThe original and singularly bold idea of making a dumb girl the heroine\r\nof a grand opera was received at the outset with censure on the part of\r\nthe critics; and it must be admitted as a general principle that the\r\ncritics were perfectly right. Slowly, however, the public became\r\naccustomed to this creation, and it has now for a long time been\r\nadmitted that the rôle of Fenella is a mark of genius. The whole of this\r\npart played in dumb show seems to be voiced, as it were, by the\r\norchestra, which renders in a wonderfully happy manner and with\r\nextraordinary dexterity the sentiments felt by the sister of the fisher\r\nMassaniello.\r\n\r\nAs to the overture, it has earned public approval in every part of the\r\nworld where an orchestra can be found capable of executing it. It is\r\nbrilliant, dramatic, pathetic, and the _motif_ of the triumphal march\r\nwhich constitutes the _allegro_ is superb and truly irresistible in its\r\npower to move the audience.\r\n\r\nSpace would fail us were we to stop, even for a moment, to speak of each\r\none of his works, and we cannot do more than name them. Yet their names\r\nalone will sing in the reader’s memory those varied songs, so\r\n_spirituel_, so well suited to the works which they designate that they\r\nhave nearly all continued to hold the musical stage of Europe ever since\r\nthey were first produced. They are as follows: “La Fiancée,” “Fra\r\nDiavolo,” “Le Dieu et la Bayadère,” “Gustave III.,” “Lestocq,” “Le\r\nCheval de Bronze,” “Actéon,” “Les Chaperons Blancs,” “L’Ambassadrice,”\r\n“Le Domino Noir,” “Le Lac des Fées,” “Zanetta,” “Les Diamants de la\r\nCouronne,” “Le Duc d’Aloune,” “La Part du Diable,” “La Sirène,” “La\r\nBarcarolle,” “Haydée,” “L’Enfant Prodigue,” “Zerline, ou la Corbeille\r\nd’Oranges,” “Marco Spada,” “Jenny Bell,” “Manon Lescaut,” “La\r\nCircassienne,” “La Fiancée du Roi de Garbes,” “Le Premier Jour de\r\nBonheur,” “Rêve d’Amour.” This last-named comic opera was the last of\r\nthe long series of the dramatic works of our author. It was represented\r\non the 20th of December, 1869, and truth compels us to state that it was\r\nreceived with some reserve. Quite the reverse was the fate of “Le\r\nPremier Jour de Bonheur,” which obtained a full measure of success. In\r\nthis opera occurs an exquisite melody that speedily became popular, “Les\r\nDjinns.”\r\n\r\nRossini has described Auber’s talent in a remarkably pithy manner.\r\n“Auber,” said he, “may have produced light music, but he produced it\r\nlike a great musician.” So much meaning could not be condensed into\r\nfewer words. Even so, Auber, in spite of the slight appearance of his\r\nwork, was one of the most learned musicians of his time. But he took as\r\nmuch pains to conceal his knowledge as others do to exhibit theirs. His\r\ngreat desire was, evidently in obedience to the nature of the man, to be\r\nalways clear, melodious, lovable, _spirituel_, attractive in every way;\r\nnever wearisome. In this he was perhaps wrong. Possessing as he did the\r\nscience of counterpoint and a wonderful dexterity in instrumentation, he\r\nwould have done well to make himself, from time to time at least, more\r\nobscure, mystical, symbolical and enigmatical, for in so doing he would\r\nhave risen in the esteem of the pedants who affect to like only that\r\nkind of music which is wearisome and to understand only that which is\r\nincomprehensible. Such obscurity on his part would have thrown into\r\nstill higher relief the inspirations born of his truly creative\r\nfaculties, I mean his songs and his _motifs_. Whenever he desired to do\r\nso, Auber well knew how to rise to the lofty and pathetic, and he could\r\nproduce what is called grand high class music. Let such as doubt this\r\nread the fourth act of “Manon Lescaut,” and they will be convinced that\r\nthere was in the mind and heart of Auber something more than dance\r\nmusic. We have there grand and beautiful music, and I find it difficult\r\nto mention any orchestration richer or more impressive and more\r\nbeautifully conceived than that which occurs in “La Circassienne.” We\r\nhave only to read the many _solfeggios_ that he wrote during the long\r\nyears when he was director of the Conservatoire for competition among\r\nthe pupils learning the sol-fa system, and we shall find in these minor\r\nmasterpieces the sure hand of an eminent and profound harmonist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oscar Comettant]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MEDALLION OF AUBER\r\n\r\n  by David.\r\n\r\n  From Paris Opera Archives.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  J. F. E. HALÉVY\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a portrait by Weger, engraved after a photograph._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                JACQUES FRANÇOIS FROMENTAL ELIAS HALÉVY.\r\n\r\n\r\nJacques François Fromental Elias Halévy was born in Paris, May 27, 1799,\r\nof Jewish parents, whose family name was Lévi. The same considerations\r\nof expediency that induced Meyerbeer to change his name from Beer to\r\nthat which he afterwards made famous, proved similarly potent with\r\nHalévy. His father was by birth a Bavarian, his mother was born in\r\nLorraine. The former was greatly honored among French Israelites for his\r\nupright character and as a Hebrew scholar profoundly versed in the\r\nTalmud. While yet very young, Halévy developed such remarkable musical\r\nprecocity that he was sent to the Conservatory when only ten years of\r\nage. He was at once placed in the class of Berton, then in the full\r\nflush of his triumph as the composer of “Montano et Stéphanie,” his\r\nmasterpiece. Berton outlived his fame, and his music is now forgotten.\r\nIt may be mentioned in passing, that Berton was greatly piqued by the\r\nsuccess of Rossini, and published two acrimonious pamphlets attacking\r\nthe Italian composer. One of these was entitled, “De la Musique\r\nMécanique et de la Musique Philosophique,” and the other, “Epître à un\r\ncélèbre compositeur Français précédée de quelques observations sur la\r\nMusique Mécanique et la Musique Philosophique.” Of course, “la musique\r\nmécanique” was the music of Rossini, and “la musique philosophique” was\r\nthat of Berton. The “célèbre compositeur” was Boieldieu, who was greatly\r\nmortified by a dedication that identified him with sentiments wholly in\r\nconflict with those he entertained toward Rossini.\r\n\r\nHalévy prosecuted his studies so industriously under the guidance of\r\nBerton, who was an admirable musician, and progressed so rapidly, that\r\none year after he entered the Conservatory, he won a prize in solfeggio,\r\nand the year following, the second prize in harmony was bestowed on him.\r\nFrom Berton’s instruction he passed to that of Cherubini, who subjected\r\nhim to a rigid course of counterpoint, fugue and composition. Here\r\nagain, he advanced with such speed that at the end of seven years, and\r\nwhile yet a boy of seventeen, he competed for the Grand Prix de Rome,\r\nobtaining the second prize for his cantata, “Les dernières moments de\r\nTasse.” The next year the second prize again fell to his lot, and the\r\nyear following, 1819, he reached the height of his ambition, carrying\r\noff the Grand Prix itself for his “Herminie.”\r\n\r\nThis much-coveted distinction is awarded at the annual competitive\r\nexaminations of the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The successful candidates\r\nbecome government pensioners for four years, and as such are sent to\r\nRome, where they reside in the Villa Medici, in the Académie de France.\r\nThe prize composition was, at first, a cantata for one voice and\r\norchestra, and after, for one male and one female voice and orchestra.\r\nThe prize was established in 1803, and since then, a winner has been\r\nsent, at the cost of the government, to Rome, every year, except in\r\nthose years when no composition was considered worthy the prize. It is\r\nsomewhat curious that of the sixty and odd students whose achievements\r\nand future promise won for them this honor, so few attained to permanent\r\nfame. The only prize-winners whose names have made the tour of the world\r\nare Hérold, Halévy, Berlioz, A. Thomas, Gounod, Bizet, and Massenet.\r\n\r\nBefore his departure for Rome, he composed a Funeral March and a “De\r\nProfondis” on the death of the Duc de Berri (1820), for three voices and\r\norchestra. He dedicated it to Cherubini, and it was performed in the\r\nsynagogue in Rue St. Avoye. In Italy he devoted himself with his\r\naccustomed energy to serious and unflagging study; wrote an opera, which\r\nwas not performed, and some works for the church, which remain\r\nunpublished. At the end of his prescribed term abroad, he returned home,\r\neager to prove to his fellow countrymen that he had not studied in vain.\r\nHe turned his eyes in the direction of the opera stage, but experienced\r\nthe usual disappointments, in his early attempts to obtain a hearing,\r\nand was almost in despair at the discouraging difficulties that stood in\r\nhis way. He composed “Les Bohémiennes” and offered it to the Grand\r\nOpera, but it was not accepted. He was more successful with “Pygmalion,”\r\nwhich was received and placed in rehearsal, but it was suddenly\r\nwithdrawn and never performed. An opera comique, “Les deux Pavillons,”\r\nmet the same depressing fate. Halévy began to lose hope, when in 1827,\r\nand when he was twenty-eight years of age, the Théâtre Feydeau accepted\r\nhis “L’Artisan,” which was produced in the same year without making any\r\nvery marked impression. It is an unambitious work of no special\r\ninterest, except for some piquant couplets, and a well-written chorus.\r\nThe following year he collaborated with Rifaut in the score of “Le Roi\r\net le Batelier,” written for the fête of Charles X. In the same year\r\n“Clari” was given at the Théâtre Italien. This was a three-act opera,\r\nand up to that time, his most important work. Malibran sung the\r\nprincipal part, and for the first time the young composer experienced\r\nthe intoxication of success. There is, however, nothing in the score to\r\nindicate the Halévy of “La Juive” and of “L’Eclair.”\r\n\r\nIn 1829 he was appointed, at the Théâtre Italien, to share with Hérold\r\nthe duties of chef du chant. In that year was produced, at the Opera\r\nComique, his “Le Dilletante d’Avignon,” a parody on Italian opera\r\nlibrettos, which was heartily applauded, and of which the chorus, “Vive,\r\nvive l’Italie,” was hummed and whistled and attained to the honor of\r\nadoption by vaudeville writers. His next work was “La Langue Musicale,”\r\nwhich, despite some pretty music, failed, owing to the silliness of the\r\nlibretto. In the spring of 1830, “Manon Lescaut,” a ballet, charming in\r\nmelody and brilliant in orchestration, was produced with great success,\r\nand was published. Then came in 1832 the ballet-opera, “La Tentation,”\r\nwritten in collaboration with Casimir Gide, and though it was well\r\nreceived it brought no fame to Halévy. He had worked faithfully and\r\nindefatigably, but as yet without winning the recognition for which he\r\nso fervently hoped. Opera after opera was composed with remarkable\r\nrapidity, to meet with no greater prosperity than a _succès d’estime_. A\r\none-act comic opera, “Les Souvenirs de Lafleur,” brought him no better\r\nfortune. Hérold dying in 1833, and leaving his opera, “Ludovic,”\r\nunfinished, Halévy completed it, composing for the first act a fine\r\nquartet that was always encored, and writing the whole of the second\r\nact. Still, the composer failed to win fame; but the clouds were about\r\nto dissipate suddenly and to display his sun at once, in its fullest\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, “La Juive” was given at the Grand Opera, and Halévy was hailed\r\nas a master composer. The work was received with a frenzy of delight,\r\nand in the wild enthusiasm it aroused, the composer enjoyed all that\r\nfollows recognized genius and well-earned fame in the capital of France.\r\nThis work opened to him every opera house in Europe, and a career of\r\nbrilliant success. In the same year in which this masterpiece saw the\r\nlight, he produced a work of a character so wholly different as to\r\nexcite wonder that it could have come from the same composer. It is,\r\nhowever, no less great in its way, and was no less overwhelmingly\r\nsuccessful. This was “L’Eclair,” a musical comedy for two tenors and two\r\nsopranos only, and without choruses. It is exquisitely charming, a model\r\nof artistic skill and profound knowledge gracefully employed. These\r\nworks won for him admission to the Institute, where he succeeded Reiche.\r\nHalévy was then thirty-seven years old, and had reached his highest\r\npoint of greatness, for though he wrote many more operas, he never again\r\nequalled “La Juive” and “L’Eclair.”\r\n\r\nThe year after “La Juive” was produced, Meyerbeer’s “Les Huguenots”\r\nappeared and proved to be an epoch-making opera. Its instant and\r\nenormous success had an unfavorable effect on Halévy, for he abandoned\r\nhis own peculiar individuality of style, and became a follower, if not\r\nan imitator of Meyerbeer. Still worse, for in his eagerness to compose,\r\nhe was not particular in his choice of librettos, and accepted any to\r\nwhich music could be written. The result was a series of opera books,\r\nmostly of a gloomy turn, that no music could deprive of their\r\ntiresomeness or make interesting. Under this unwise course of action he\r\nsoon exhausted his musical invention and became nearly as dull as were\r\nhis librettos. “Les Mousquetaires de la Reine,” and “Le Val d’Andorre,”\r\ntwo fine operas, must be excepted.\r\n\r\nHis industry was astonishing, as will be seen by the following complete\r\nlist of the works that succeed his two crowning triumphs: “Guido et\r\nGinevra,” grand opera, five acts, 1838; “Les Treize,” comic opera, three\r\nacts, and “Le Shérif,” comic opera, three acts, 1839; “Le Drapier,”\r\ncomic opera, three acts, 1840; “Le Guiterrara,” comic opera, three acts,\r\nand “La Reine de Chypre,” grand opera, five acts, 1843; “Le Lazzarone,”\r\ncomic opera, two acts, 1844; “Les Mousquetaires de la Reine,” comic\r\nopera, three acts, 1846; “Le Val d’Andorre,” comic opera, three acts,\r\n1848; incidental music for “Prométhée Enchainé,” and “La Fée aux Roses,”\r\ncomic opera, three acts, 1849; “La Tempesta,” grand opera, three acts,\r\nand “La Dame de Pique,” comic opera, three acts, 1850; “Le Juif Errant,”\r\ngrand opera, five acts, 1852; “Le Nabab,” comic opera, three acts, 1853;\r\n“Jaquarita l’Indienne,” comic opera, three acts, 1855; “Valentine\r\nd’Aubigny,” comic opera, three acts, 1856; “La Magicienne,” grand opera,\r\nfive acts, 1858; “Noé,” grand opera, five acts (unfinished); “Les Plages\r\ndu Nil,” cantata with chorus and orchestra, besides numerous vocal\r\npieces and some music for the pianoforte. Of all these operas only “Les\r\nMousquetaires” and “Le Val d’Andorre” survive through occasional\r\nperformances. The latter, when originally produced, saved the Opéra\r\nComique from bankruptcy, and ten years later relieved the\r\nThéâtre-Lyrique from pecuniary difficulties against which it then\r\nstruggled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARICATURE OF HALÉVY BY DANTAN.\r\n\r\n  From the Carnavalet Museum, Paris.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the production of this immense mass of operatic music,\r\nHalévy was able to fill the part of one of the principal professors at\r\nthe Conservatoire. In 1831 he was made professor of counterpoint and\r\nfugue, and in 1840 he became professor of composition. He wrote a book\r\nof instruction, entitled, “Leçons de lecture musicale,” which first\r\nappeared in 1857. It remains, in a revised form, the accepted text-book\r\nfor teaching solfeggio in the primary schools of Paris. Among his more\r\ndistinguished pupils were Gounod, Victor Massé, Bazin and Bizet, the\r\nlast-named of whom married Halévy’s daughter.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 he was made permanent secretary of the Académie des Beaux-Arts.\r\nIt was a part of his duties in this office to pronounce eulogiums. These\r\nhe published, with additions, in 1869, under the title, “Souvenirs et\r\nPortraits, études sur les beaux arts.” They are gracefully written, and\r\nare entertaining and edifying reading. In 1861 the severe work to which\r\nhe had subjected himself, began to tell on his health. A southern\r\nclimate was ordered by his physicians. He selected Nice, whither he\r\ndeparted with his family in December, 1861. It was too late, and\r\nmoreover, in the comparative quiet of his new abode he missed the\r\nexcitement to which he had been accustomed. His debility rendered work\r\nalmost impossible, and his depression in consequence was painfully\r\nintensified. The end came March 17, 1862. His body was taken to Paris\r\nand buried on the 24th of the same month, with great ceremony. “La\r\nJuive” was revived at the Grand Opera in honor of his memory, on the\r\n29th of May, and his bust, the work of his widow, was crowned on the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HALÉVY’S TOMB IN PÈRE LACHAISE, PARIS.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph made specially for this work.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHalévy was a highly gifted man. In addition to his genius for music, he\r\nhad innate talent for writing and was an excellent poet and a brilliant\r\nliterateur. He was acquainted with German, Italian, English and Latin\r\nand also with Hebrew and Greek. As a composer, though he was a musician\r\nof rare talents, he wrote too much, too rapidly and too carelessly, to\r\ndo himself full justice. His two masterpieces are almost immeasurably\r\nabove any of his other operas. In these latter, we meet, now and then,\r\nwith moments of great beauty, with scenes of thrilling dramatic power,\r\nbut they are in the midst of much that is oppressively dull owing to the\r\nrigid obscurity of style in which they are written. He seems to have had\r\nso sensitive a fear of falling into commonplace that he went to the\r\nopposite extreme, even avoiding clearly marked rhythms. His mannerisms\r\nwere a persistent resort to the minor key, a fondness for a soft\r\npianissimo effect on the lower notes, long held, to be regularly and\r\nsuddenly opposed by a loud crash of the whole orchestra on the upper\r\nnotes; unexpected and violent contrasts in dynamics that are mere\r\ncapricious effects without any logical cause; prolixity and\r\nover-deliberately following a sombre strain with one of great\r\nbrilliancy, and vice versa. In all his scores, however, his fine genius\r\nis manifested, and it is impossible to study one of them carefully\r\nwithout becoming impressed by the vigor, the affluence and the\r\nflexibility of his genius. He was equally at home in the gloom of\r\ntragedy and the gaiety of piquant comedy. In scenes of pomp in which the\r\nstage is crowded with characters concerned in some high festivity, he is\r\npeculiarly felicitous. He was a master of passion in its every aspect,\r\nand when he is at his best here, he never sounds a false note. His\r\ncharacters are always strongly defined, and no composer has left behind\r\nhim a more masterly collection of vivid stage portraits than has he. He\r\nwas essentially the bard of melancholy, as his many exquisitely tender\r\nand mournful melodies testify. One of the typical characteristics of his\r\nmusic is its refined distinction. His abhorrence of triviality was so\r\nkeen that it caused him often to go too far out of his way to avoid it,\r\nand the result was that he overfrequently fastened on his music a\r\nlabored aspect that was fatal to the impression of spontaneity in\r\neffect. When he was less self-conscious, however, his music flows with\r\ndelightful ease, lucidity and naturalness. His instrumentation is that\r\nof a thorough master. He had a fine sense of tone-color, and his scores\r\nare rarely overloaded. He was an innovator in the use and treatment of\r\nwind instruments, and anticipated many effects that have been claimed\r\nfor those who came after him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph manuscript by Halévy in possession of the Paris\r\n    Opera Library.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn “La Juive” the orchestration is, in point of richness, originality\r\nand variety of powerful contrasts, much in advance of anything\r\npreviously known in French opera; and his instrumentation of “L’Eclair,”\r\nin its freshness, vivacity and piquancy, was no less innovating, and\r\nnotable in a lighter direction. In “La Juive” he had a libretto which is\r\namong the finest that were ever set to music. Its tragic story is told\r\nwith immense effect, and the poet’s knowledge of the needs of a composer\r\nis manifested with masterly ability. Halévy never again obtained such a\r\nbook. How felicitously it inspired him, is seen in the first act in the\r\nimpressive reply of the Cardinal to Eleazar’s contempt for the\r\nChristians; in the romance sung by Leopold to Rachel; in the chorus of\r\nthe people at the fountain which runs with wine; in the magnificent\r\nchorus and march which precede the brilliant entrance of the Emperor,\r\nand ending with the stirring Te Deum and the welcome to the Emperor. In\r\nthe second act, the Passover scene in Eleazar’s house is full of\r\ninterest in its Jewish elements, with which Halévy, himself a Jew, must\r\nhave been in complete sympathy. In the same act there are the fiery duet\r\nbetween Eudoxia and Leopold, and the other duet, equally spirited and\r\nintense in effect, between Rachel and Leopold, both masterpieces in\r\ntheir way, and speedily followed by the no less splendid dramatic aria\r\nsung by Rachel to her father, and in which she announces her love for\r\nLeopold; the climax of this wonderful act being reached in the thrilling\r\ntrio, in which Eleazar pronounces the curse. The next act, with its\r\nbrilliant pageantries, falls short of that which precedes it, but has an\r\nimmensely dramatic, concerted number which culminates in the anathema by\r\nthe Cardinal. The fourth act rises to the level of the second, with its\r\nnoble duet between Eleazar and the Cardinal, the tremendous scene of the\r\nJew in which he savagely defies his Christian foes and welcomes death.\r\nThe last act is for the most part declamatory, and has no such numbers\r\nas those we have named, but the impressive dramatic intensity of the\r\nwork is maintained to the end.\r\n\r\nIn “Guido et Ginevra,” he tries to repeat the success of “La Juive,” but\r\ndespite several fine flights of genius he failed, not only owing to the\r\nmorbidly sad and dull nature of the play, but to the heaviness of the\r\nmusic. He was more successful with “La Reine de Chypre,” an essentially\r\nspectacular opera, which, by the way, was analyzed by Wagner in one of\r\nhis Paris letters (1841). The score is often brilliant and melodious,\r\nand it contains some movingly pathetic melodies, but it is uneven in\r\nexcellence, and has pages on pages of music so obscure in meaning and so\r\ndull in effect that its interest is often impaired. Almost the same\r\ncriticism may be made on his next grand opera, “Charles VI.” Moreover,\r\nby this time, Meyerbeer’s “Les Huguenots” had been produced, and Halévy,\r\ncarried away by the enthusiasm with which that work filled him,\r\nconsciously or otherwise, deserted his own marked individuality and\r\nbecame, to all intents and purposes, a follower of Meyerbeer, at least\r\nin grand opera. In his “Le Val d’Andorre” he became himself again, for\r\nthe time being, and produced a lyric drama that fell little short of\r\nperfection in the complete sympathy with which the composer identified\r\nhimself with the poet. There Halévy sounded the very depths of\r\npassionate grief, in the music he has given to Rosa after her lover has\r\nbeen drawn as conscript. In “Les Mousquetaires de la Reine” he produced\r\na delightful score, sparkling, chivalrous in spirit and full of\r\nbeauties. For the rest there is little to be said that would not be in\r\nthe way of repetition. His “La Tempesta,” written for Her Majesty’s\r\nTheatre, London, was received there with enthusiastic favor, but\r\nalthough there are some genuine beauties in the work, especially in the\r\nfinely characteristic music given to Caliban, it has nothing in it that\r\nentitles it to live. Halévy was greatly piqued that the one melody most\r\npraised by the artists, and that was hummed by everybody, was Dr. Arne’s\r\n“Where the bee sucks,” which he had retained for Ariel. With all his\r\nfecundity in melody Halévy rarely wrote one that achieved general\r\npopularity. The most noted exception is “Quand de la nuit l’épais nuage”\r\nfrom “L’Eclair,” a charming air, simple, chaste, and delicious in its\r\ntender grace. He seldom, however, vouchsafed so unaffected a tune, the\r\nharmonies of which are for the most part confined to the tonic and\r\ndominant. The romance “Pendant la fête une inconnue,” from “Guido et\r\nGenevra,” is another morceau, scarcely less naïve and delicate, that\r\nlong survived the opera in which it appeared, but it did not make the\r\ntour of the world as did the other. His comic operas abound in\r\nfascinating music which is buried, and must remain so, in the\r\nuninteresting librettos that he so thoughtlessly accepted. In that\r\ndreary book, “Le Drapier,” there is a glorious duet, “Ah! devenez mon\r\npère.” But there is not an opera of his in which some perfect gem is not\r\nto be found. His fecundity in melody is impressively exemplified in the\r\nfairy opera “La Fée aux Roses,” of which the score is affluent in\r\ncharming music, sensuously oriental in style, beautiful in local color,\r\nand of striking originality in orchestral treatment. He made an attempt\r\nto revive the enharmonic scale of the Greeks in his “Prométhée\r\nEnchainé,” the translation of which had been made by his brother. It was\r\na bold adventure, but it failed. It must be confessed that it is\r\nmonotonous because of lack of variety in the orchestration, owing to the\r\nalmost continuous use of wind instruments to the neglect of the strings.\r\nThe recitatives are noble, and the chorus of the Océanides is one of his\r\nmost classical and beautiful compositions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARICATURE OF HALÉVY BY CARJAT.\r\n\r\n  From the Paris illustrated paper “Le Gaulois.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nHalévy, despite all his industry and the fame he enjoyed through his\r\ngreatest successes, made no lasting impression on the music of his day.\r\nEven “La Juive,” notwithstanding its power and its brilliancy, found no\r\nimitators, and “L’Eclair” still stands alone, the only example in its\r\n_genre_. It is sad that an artist should have labored so long and so\r\nwell, should have been a thorough master of his art, and yet have fallen\r\nalmost into obscurity thirty years after his death. A careful\r\nexamination of some of his more ambitious operas shows that he was, in\r\nsome respects, slightly in advance of his time, especially in his\r\ntendency to avoid purely rhythmical airs in favor of what is now called\r\n“Endless Melody,” but there is no likelihood that the future will revive\r\nhis works. It was his misfortune that Meyerbeer’s star rose so early\r\nafter the appearance of “La Juive,” and that Halévy was drawn into the\r\nvortex that the rage for the composer of “Les Huguenots” made. If he had\r\nfollowed the example of the latter, had written music to none but good\r\nlibrettos, economized his talents instead of wasting them in a reckless\r\nambition to produce music; if he had also adhered firmly to his own\r\nindividual originality instead of permitting himself to be unreasonably\r\ninfluenced by the success of another, his operas might have had a\r\nstronger claim than they have on the favorable consideration of\r\nposterity. When Halévy wrote “La Juive,” the time was ripe for a great\r\nrevolution in French grand opera, and he just escaped becoming an\r\nepoch-maker at his art. Meyerbeer appeared at that moment, and to him\r\nfell the honor that was just within Halévy’s grasp. Whether the latter\r\nwould have seized it if his rival’s career had been delayed, it is hard\r\nto say, for his lack of discrimination in the choice of opera books was\r\nalready deep-seated. Saint Beuve says of him: “‘La Juive,’ ‘Guido,’ ‘La\r\nReine de Chypre,’ ‘Charles VI,’ are true lyric tragedies on which are\r\nthe seal of beauties that time cannot obliterate. Some works, that\r\nappeal more readily to the tastes of the masses, have been dowered with\r\ngreater popularity, but the decision of those who know is the only one\r\nthat appeals to a conscientious artist, and of this, Halévy received an\r\nample share. We think we are not mistaken in saying that as musical\r\neducation becomes more widespread, the popularity of Halévy will grow.”\r\nThis, however, is doubtful, and it is more than probable that Halévy\r\nhimself felt that he had not wholly accomplished his mission, for Saint\r\nBeuve, who knew him well, also says, “It is strange that this estimable\r\nman, always full of work, should sometimes have nursed a secret sorrow.\r\nWhat it was, not even his most cherished and trusted friends ever knew.\r\nHe never complained.” Who shall say that this secret sorrow, so silently\r\nguarded, was not born of a sense of failure, or at least, of\r\nself-disappointment! It is not improbable that toward the close of his\r\nbusy art-life he saw, with prophetic eye, the fate that was to attend\r\nthe greater part of what he had composed; that he had written for his\r\nown time and not for the future. Already he has become little more than\r\na name to nearly all, except students of musical history. The works on\r\nwhich his fame chiefly rests are seldom performed, and the others,\r\nadmirable as many of them are, have gone into oblivion, and in all\r\nprobability, never to see the light again. That he was a master in his\r\nart, is unquestionable, but it would seem also that he was lacking in\r\nthat highest quality of genius that confers immortality on its\r\npossessor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B.

Courbet._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BERLIOZ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                             HECTOR BERLIOZ\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than a score of years have passed since Berlioz died, in Paris,\r\nthat city which was the object of his youthful dreams, the scene of his\r\nbitter struggles and his sublime defeats. It was in the midst of those\r\nParisians, who had accorded him little more than mockery and scorn, that\r\nhe had wished to die, weighed down by sadness and discouragement,\r\nsupported by a few intimate friends and rare disciples. Moreover, did he\r\nnot foresee that sad end when writing the following lines which\r\nsubsequent events proved only too true? “It was about that time of my\r\nacademic life that I experienced again the attack of a cruel malady\r\n(moral, nervous, imaginary, whatever you like) which I will call\r\nsickness of isolation, and which will kill me some day.... This is not\r\nspleen, though it leads to that later on; it is the boiling away, the\r\nevaporation of the heart, the senses, the brain, the nervous fluid.\r\nSpleen is the congelation of all that, it is the block of ice.”\r\nTherefore death was for him a blessed release. For some years before,\r\nthere remained of Hector Berlioz nothing but an earthly frame, an inert\r\nand suffering body; the moral being was crushed. The fall of _The\r\nTrojans_ was the rudest possible shock to that nature so well tempered\r\nto receive it; hitherto the proud artist had returned blow for blow;\r\nnever had a defeat, however grave, completely overthrown him. For the\r\nfirst time, in witnessing the downfall of the work of his predilection,\r\nthe athlete had faltered. He had laid down his arms and thenceforth,\r\nweary of life and of the struggle, had contented himself with the hollow\r\ndiversions which the capital offered him, “preoccupied solely with\r\nmaterial interests, inattentive and indifferent to that which impassions\r\npoets and artists, having a morbid taste for scandal and mockery,\r\nlaughing with a dry and mirthless laugh when this strange taste is\r\ngratified.” A certain heartache, a vague suffering of the soul, vain\r\nregrets, preyed upon him at least as much as bodily ills; his shade\r\nalone wandered among us, dumb, taciturn, _isolated_, and one beautiful\r\nmorning in the month of March it vanished.\r\n\r\nBerlioz’s militant career may be divided into two distinct periods; that\r\nin which he struggles for position, and which lasts from his arrival in\r\nParis until after _Romeo and Juliet_ and the _Funeral and Triumphal\r\nSymphony_, in 1842; that in which, tired of struggling without profit\r\nthough not without glory, he starts off to establish his reputation\r\noutside the frontier, and to return afterwards to Paris, victorious and\r\ntriumphant; this lasts until his death. So soon as he achieved a success\r\nabroad, great or small, “Be sure that Paris knows it!” was the cry to\r\nhis friends. And Paris, being informed of it, had forgotten it\r\ninstantly. It was during the intervals between these tours, when he came\r\nback to France to see if his foreign successes had given him a better\r\nstanding in the eyes of his countrymen, that his last principal works\r\nwere produced: _The Damnation of Faust_, _The Childhood of Christ_, _The\r\nTe Deum_ and _Beatrice and Benedict_, finally _The Trojans_.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the end of 1821 that Berlioz came to Paris, ostensibly to\r\nstudy medicine, but with a secret longing to devote himself to music. He\r\nwas then nearly eighteen years of age, being born at La Côte Saint-André\r\n(Isère), Dec. 11, 1803, and had already received some lessons in music\r\nfrom the poor stranded artists at La Côte. We are indebted to Berlioz\r\nhimself for the names of these artists, which were Imbert and Dorant.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Paris, where his father, a simple health officer, but a\r\ndevotee to the sciences and to medicine, had allowed him to come on the\r\nexpress condition that he should follow exactly the course of the\r\nFaculty, he set to work as best he could to carry out this program. But\r\none evening he goes to the Opera to hear Salieri’s _Danaïdes_:\r\nimmediately music regains possession of his soul, and he spends all his\r\nspare time in the library of the _Conservatoire_, studying the scores of\r\nGluck’s operas; there he meets a pupil of Lesueur who introduces him to\r\nthat master, and he attaches himself with much affection to the author\r\nof the _Bardes_, who admits him to his class. At length he informs his\r\nfamily of his settled determination to devote himself to music, and he\r\nhas performed at Saint-Roch a mass which he burns almost immediately\r\nafter, saving only the _Resurrexit_ which obtains grace in his sight, at\r\nleast for a time. He then took part in the preparatory concours for the\r\nprize of Rome, and was not even judged worthy to be a competitor.\r\nImmediately summoned home by his parents, who had no faith in his\r\n“pretended irresistible vocation,” he arrived there so sad, so crushed,\r\nso misanthropic, that his father, uneasy about him, permitted him to\r\nreturn to try once more his fortune in Paris. He came back for the\r\nwinter of 1826, having nothing to live on but a small allowance from his\r\nfamily, on which he was obliged to economize in order to pay back,\r\nlittle by little, a loan which a friend had made him for the execution\r\nof his mass. His existence at this time, which was shared by another\r\nstudent, his friend Carbonnel, was a very miserable one, their meals\r\nconsisting on certain days of vegetables and dried fruits. He gave\r\nlessons in solfeggio at a franc a lesson, and even applied for the\r\nposition of chorus singer at the _Théâtre des Nouveautés_. But artistic\r\npleasures counterbalanced the material privations, and his heart danced\r\nfor joy whenever he could go to the _Opéra_ or to the _Odéon_ and hear\r\nsome masterpiece by Spontini, Gluck or Weber; his fourth god, Beethoven,\r\nwas not revealed to him till two years later, when Habeneck founded the\r\n_Société des concerts du Conservatoire_ for the dissemination of the\r\nworks of that prodigious genius. He continued however in the classes of\r\nLesueur and Reicha, so that he was able to pass the preliminary\r\nexamination for the concours of 1828. The subject given out by the board\r\nof examiners was a scene from _Orpheus torn to pieces by Bacchantes_,\r\nand Berlioz’s music was declared by the judges as _impossible to be\r\nplayed_. His only response was to prepare for its performance at the\r\nconcert to be given at the Conservatoire, the superintendent of the\r\nBeaux-Arts, M. de Larochefoucauld, to whom he had been recommended,\r\nhaving placed that hall at his disposal, notwithstanding the violent\r\nprotestations of the director, Cherubini. But chance favored the\r\nself-love of the members of the Institute, for Berlioz was obliged to\r\ngive up his plan, on account of an indisposition of the singer Alexis\r\nDupont.\r\n\r\nIt would have been strange indeed, if Berlioz, with his ardent\r\nimagination and brain always on fire, had allowed the romantic movement\r\nto pass by without attaching himself to it with all the fury and passion\r\nwhich he threw into everything. He soon became one of the leaders of the\r\nnew school, poor enough in musicians, counting only himself and Monpau,\r\nwhereas it abounded in writers and artists. Like all his comrades in\r\nromanticism, even exceeding them all, Berlioz was an enthusiastic and\r\nconstant visitor at the _Odéon_, where some of Shakespeare’s plays were\r\nthen being given by a company of English tragedians. Here he received a\r\ndouble blow; from Shakespeare who floored him, as he said, and from Miss\r\nSmithson who intoxicated him. It was to attract the attention of the\r\nbeautiful tragedienne that he organized, with his overtures to\r\n_Waverley_ and _Francs-Juges_ and his cantata of _la Mort d’Orphée_, a\r\nconcert which she never heard anything about. It was also this idea of\r\nreaching her through the medium of music which inspired him to write his\r\n_Fantastic Symphony_, in which he put himself in the scene with his\r\nbeloved, and which, in fact, was to end by gaining him Miss Smithson’s\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAs these first attempts of Berlioz are little known, it is well to\r\nspecify them, if for no other reason than because one may find in these\r\nforgotten pieces the plan of certain pages of the _Damnation of Faust_\r\nand the _Childhood of Christ_. His overtures to _Waverley_ and to the\r\n_Francs-Juges_ were performed for the first time at the concert which he\r\ngave at the Conservatoire, in honor of Miss Smithson, May 26, 1828; on\r\nthis occasion he also had played the _Resurrexit_ from his first mass,\r\nin place of _The Death of Orpheus_, which could not be given owing to\r\nthe illness of Alexis Dupont, a march of the Magi going to visit the\r\nmanger, and a grand scene on the Greek Revolution. Finally, on the 1st\r\nof November, 1829, he had his two overtures repeated, together with his\r\n_Resurrexit_ under a new title, _The Last Judgment_, and a new work\r\nentitled _Chorus of Sylphs_, the plan of which is as follows:\r\n“Mephistopheles, in order to excite in Faust’s soul the love of\r\npleasure, assembles the sprites of the air and bids them sing. After a\r\nprelude on their magic instruments, they describe an enchanted country,\r\nthe inhabitants of which are intoxicated with perpetual delights.\r\nGradually the charm operates, the voices of the Sylphs die away and\r\nFaust, fallen asleep, remains plunged in delicious dreams.” Everybody\r\nknows to-day what this adorable bit has become.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Berlioz obtained the “Prix de Rome” in July, 1830, after\r\nhaving tried for it four times in vain. He set out at once for Rome,\r\nfirst giving, however, a farewell concert at which was played his\r\ncantata of _Sardanapalus_ and the _Fantastic Symphony_, aimed at Miss\r\nSmithson whom Berlioz execrated because of her ignorant indifference,\r\nand who, moreover, had not the slightest suspicion of his mad passion\r\nand frantic hatred. The young composer departed quite proud of his\r\nsuccess and also of the sharp response of Cherubini who said, when asked\r\nif he was going to hear the new production of Berlioz, “I do not need to\r\ngo to find out _how things should not be done_.” He stayed in Italy\r\nnearly two years, in order to conform to the regulations of the Academy,\r\nbut it was time wasted for him from an artistic point of view. With his\r\njust and profound distaste for Italian music, he was in no condition to\r\nbe benefited by it. The only comfort he took was in fleeing to the\r\ncountry, where he strolled with his new friend Mendelssohn; but this\r\ncompanionship proved uncongenial and was short-lived. He shortened his\r\nsojourn in Italy as much as possible, and as soon as the director Horace\r\nVernet gave him leave, he returned to Paris, taking with him an overture\r\nto King Lear and the monodrama of _Lelio or the Return to Life_, a\r\nseries of old pieces worked over, which completed the _Fantastic\r\nSymphony_. This work he could have done just as well in Paris as in\r\nRome; indeed he would probably have accomplished more by remaining in\r\nParis, instead of strolling about the country near Rome playing on his\r\nguitar and frittering away his time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MISS SMITHSON.\r\n\r\n  Reproduction of a French lithograph portrait by Francis—published in\r\n    1827.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn his return to Paris he felt a reawakening of his passion for Miss\r\nSmithson, who had been temporarily forgotten and patronizingly dubbed\r\n“the Smithson girl,” while his heart was interested elsewhere. At the\r\ntime of his setting out for Rome, he had thoughts for none but the young\r\nand attractive pianiste, Marie Moke, whom he had known through his\r\nfriend Ferdinand Hiller; to her he had shown some attention, finally\r\ndeclaring to her his uncontrollable passion.\r\n\r\nThis young lady had coolly married Camille Pleyel—a name which she was\r\nto make famous as a virtuoso—while her mad lover, her pretended fiancé,\r\nwas in Italy.\r\n\r\nHe made haste, as soon as he got back to Paris, to organize a concert\r\nfor the purpose of performing in honor of Miss Smithson, the _Fantastic\r\nSymphony_, and on that day (Dec. 9, 1832) he experienced a double\r\ntriumph, since this masterpiece, which she believed to be inspired by\r\nherself, deeply touched the tragedienne and won her heart for Berlioz.\r\nLittle did she suspect that this composition had been written with a\r\nview to stigmatize her, at the time when Berlioz was madly in love with\r\nMademoiselle Moke, and that before going to Rome he had it played in\r\nhonor of Mademoiselle Moke, as it was now being given in Miss Smithson’s\r\nhonor. Meanwhile, the families of the two lovers made just opposition to\r\ntheir fine projects for the future; but Berlioz and his fiancée taking\r\nthe lead, strove their utmost to overcome these obstacles, and to tie\r\nthe indissoluble bond which was to render them equally miserable.\r\n\r\nDuring all these negotiations the English Theatre of Paris was obliged\r\nto close its doors, and Miss Smithson, who had assumed direction of it,\r\nfound herself without resources, not having enough to pay the debts of\r\nthe enterprise. To make matters worse, she broke her leg while getting\r\nout of a carriage, in which she was going about to organize a benefit\r\nconcert. While she was confined to the house by her accident, Berlioz\r\nhad the customary “respectful summons” to make to her family, and as\r\nsoon as she was well he married her; “she was mine,” he said, “and I\r\nbade defiance to every thing!” The young household was not rolling in\r\nwealth; the wife had nothing but her debts, and the husband had but\r\nthree hundred francs which a friend had lent him. No matter, even a sad\r\nlife is not without its sunshine. Berlioz was obliged to have recourse\r\nto his pen, and began to write for the newspapers through sheer\r\nnecessity, a thing which he had hitherto done through love of\r\ncontroversy and in self-defence.\r\n\r\nHis first appearance in literature was made in 1829 in the\r\n_Correspondent_, with a pretty well developed article on Beethoven, whom\r\nthe artists and amateurs of Paris were just beginning to know, thanks to\r\nHabeneck and his _Société des Concerts_ at the Conservatoire. He also\r\nfurnished some articles to the _Revue Européenne_ and the _Courrier de\r\nl’Europe_; finally, that influential paper, the _Gazette musicale de\r\nParis_, which in 1881 ended a glorious career of forty-seven years,\r\nespoused Berlioz’s cause, and worked faithfully for his success. Shortly\r\nafter, in 1835 he allied himself with the _Journal des Débats_ as\r\nmusical critic, a post which he held for thirty years, finding in its\r\nproprietors, MM. Bertin, staunch friends and protectors. Besides giving\r\nhim a comfortable living, Berlioz’s articles served him at first in\r\nestablishing relations with the press, as much as they injured him later\r\nby exciting bitter jealousy and enmity.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of financial difficulties that Berlioz wrote the\r\nsymphony _Harold in Italy_, inspired no doubt by his own excursions in\r\nthe vicinity of Rome. In this he introduced a viola part for Paganini,\r\nbut the part was too much subordinated to the orchestra to suit the\r\ngreat violinist, who desired a veritable concerto with a simple\r\norchestral accompaniment; fortunately Berlioz did not give heed to this\r\ndemand. The performance of _Harold_ (Nov. 23, 1834) made Berlioz known\r\nto connoisseurs, and soon after M. de Gasparin, Minister of the\r\nInterior, ordered of him a Requiem for the anniversary service of the\r\nvictims, not of the Revolution of 1830, but of the Fieschi outrage. This\r\n_Requiem_ did not reach its destination, but was performed at the\r\ncelebrated service in the church of the _Invalides_, Dec. 5, 1837, for\r\nthe French soldiers and General Danrémont, killed at the siege of\r\nConstantine.\r\n\r\nFortune seemed at last to smile on the persistent efforts of the young\r\ncomposer, when a failure came to overturn his fond hopes. His opera\r\n_Benvenuto Cellini_, written on a poem by Léon de Nailly and Auguste\r\nBarbier, was performed at the _Opéra_ Sept. 10, 1838; it was well\r\nsustained by Mmes. Stolz and Dorus-Gras, but badly rendered by Duprez,\r\nand disappeared from the bills after three performances, the celebrated\r\ntenor not wishing to appear in a work in which he was quite eclipsed by\r\nthe two prima donnas. Berlioz, in order to recover from the effect of\r\nthis failure, organized two Conservatoire concerts, thinking that the\r\nperformance of the _Fantastic Symphony_ would recompense him for the\r\nloss of his rights at the _Opéra_. The first concert barely covered\r\nexpenses, but the second had a memorable result. Scarcely was the\r\nsymphony ended when a man jumped upon the platform, and kissed the hands\r\nof the stupefied composer. The next day Berlioz received a letter in\r\nwhich, as a token of admiration, he was asked to accept a sum of twenty\r\nthousand francs, and this letter was signed by the enthusiastic listener\r\nof the evening before, Nicolo Paganini. This sum—whether it was, as some\r\nthink, a secret manifestation of Bertin’s liberality, or whether it was\r\nreally given by Paganini for the purpose of defending himself in the\r\neyes of the Parisians against an accusation of avarice—made Berlioz easy\r\nin his finances for some little time, and enabled him to work with an\r\nunperturbed mind. He profited by the first hours of leisure which he had\r\nfound since his return, and wrote first his symphony with solos and\r\nchoruses, _Romeo and Juliet_, which he dedicated to his official\r\nbenefactor and which was first heard Nov. 24, 1839, and then the grand\r\n_Funeral and Triumphal Symphony_, performed at the inauguration of the\r\ncolumn of July in 1840. He also wrote, about this time, a number of\r\nsongs or choral compositions, and the brilliant overture _Le Carnival\r\nRomain_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NICOLO PAGANINI.\r\n\r\n  From a drawing by Ingres in Rome, 1818. Engraved by Calamatta.\r\n    Paganini in his thirty-fourth year.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe year 1842 was an important date in Berlioz’s career. From that time\r\nhis life was a divided one. Misunderstood in his own country,\r\ndisheartened by his unsuccessful attempts to win the heart of the great\r\npublic, inconsolable for the failure of _Benvenuto_ which closed to him\r\nforever the doors of the Academy of Music, he resolved to undertake an\r\nartistic tour through Europe, and began with Belgium in the latter part\r\nof the year 1842. He met with rather more success there than in France,\r\nthough he was still the subject of heated discussion. He took with him a\r\ndecidedly mediocre singer, Mademoiselle Martin Recio, who had made a\r\nfailure at the Opéra, and had managed to attach herself to him. He\r\nmarried her later, soon after the death of Miss Smithson, from whom he\r\nhad been separated; but he was no happier in his second marriage than in\r\nhis first; his first wife drank, his second made unjustifiable\r\npretensions as a singer, which always exasperated him. After this little\r\nexcursion to Belgium, Berlioz determined to try his fortune in Germany,\r\nwhere already some of his works had found their way; from this time\r\nonward, his life was nothing more than a series of journeys through\r\nFrance and foreign countries. His first grand tour was through northern\r\nGermany. At Leipsic he saw Mendelssohn, whom he met on the best of\r\nterms, forgetting all about their youthful quarrels; at Dresden he\r\ninspired an equal devotion on the part of Richard Wagner, who received\r\nhim as a brother and treated him as a master; at Berlin he was no less\r\nwarmly welcomed by Meyerbeer, who recruited the necessary artists for\r\nhim and enabled him to direct a part of his _Requiem_.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Paris he organized, first, a monster festival at the\r\nExposition of the Products of Industry, in August, 1844, then four grand\r\nconcerts at the Circus of the Champs Elysées, early in 1845; but these\r\ngigantic concerts which it had always been his aim to direct, brought\r\nhim no profit. Not discouraged by this, however, he gave grand concerts\r\nat Marseilles and at Lyons, the modest success of which was due partly\r\nto curiosity, partly to surprise. After that he went to Austria, Bohemia\r\nand Hungary; this tour was scarcely finished when he rushed off to Lille\r\nto organize a grand festival there on the occasion of the inauguration\r\nof the Northern railroad. Finally in the summer of 1846 he returned to\r\nParis, and after having given a magnificent performance of his _Requiem_\r\nin the Saint Eustache church, he decided to bring before the public his\r\nmost important work, _The Damnation of Faust_. The first performance\r\ntook place on December 6, before a small audience. The solos were sung\r\nby Roger, Hermann, Leon, Henri, and Madame Duflôt-Maillard, who had no\r\nbetter comprehension of the music than the public. The second\r\nperformance was given on Sunday the 20th, before an equally small house,\r\nwith a tenor who had to omit the _Invocation to Nature_. This convinced\r\nBerlioz that he was still far from having conquered his own country. He\r\ndeparted for Russia, deeply wounded by the indifference of his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nSome of his Paris friends had clubbed together to furnish him the means\r\nto go to St. Petersburg, whence he had received some brilliant offers.\r\nHe achieved the greatest success there, with musicians as well as with\r\nthe public, and the fact of his having formerly befriended Glinka at\r\nParis had its effect in enlisting sympathies for him in Russia. On his\r\nway back he stopped at Berlin, where the _Damnation of Faust_ was given\r\nwith little enough appreciation, but where he received recognition from\r\nthe sovereign and the princess of Prussia. When he got back again to\r\nParis, crowned with laurels, and with money enough to settle all the\r\ndebts incurred by the performance of the _Damnation of Faust_ at the\r\n_Opéra Comique_, he worked hard to get the appointment at the Opéra of\r\nDuponchel and Roqueplan, who were talking of an immediate revival of\r\n_Benvenuto Cellini_, of mounting _la Nonne sanglante_, etc. Berlioz\r\nsucceeded in getting them nominated directors, through the aid of the\r\nBertins, but they no sooner had the official notice in their pockets\r\nthan they utterly ignored Berlioz. The latter understood that he was\r\nholding a restraint upon them, and since, as he said, he was accustomed\r\nto this sort of proceedings, he took himself off to London in order to\r\nrid them of his troublesome presence. The affair of the Drury Lane\r\nconcerts, unwisely entered into with the eccentric conductor Julien,\r\nterminated in bankruptcy, and the Revolution which followed in 1848\r\nwould have left Berlioz without a sou had not Victor Hugo and Louis\r\nBlanc obtained for the sworn disciple of the romantic school the humble\r\npost of librarian at the Conservatoire.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1848, Berlioz experienced one of the keenest sorrows of his\r\nlife in the loss of his father. He went to Grenoble to attend his\r\nfather’s funeral, and in his Mémoires he gives a most touching account\r\nof the sad visit. It was about this time that his little _Chœur de\r\nBergers_ was given under the pseudonym of Pierce Ducré, at the concerts\r\nof the Philharmonic Society, Saint Cecilia hall, Chaussée d’Antin. In\r\n1852 his _Benvenuto_ was given with great success at Weimar under the\r\nfervent direction of Liszt, but the next year the same opera utterly\r\nfailed in London, where the Italians, said Berlioz, conspired to ruin\r\nit. By “Italians” Berlioz meant the orchestral conductor Costa and his\r\nparty. Berlioz had accepted the preceding year the leadership of the New\r\nPhilharmonic, and had made by his success, and attacks, a bitter enemy\r\nof the leader of the old _Philharmonic Society_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HECTOR BERLIOZ.\r\n\r\n  Reproduced from a portrait engraved after a painting by M.\r\n    Signol—Rome—1831.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter the Empire had been restored in France, Berlioz would have liked\r\nto see reëstablished in his own favor the high position which his master\r\nLesueur had occupied under the first Empire; but all that he obtained\r\nwas the privilege of performing a Te Deum, which he was holding in\r\nreserve for the coronation of the new sovereign, and it was Auber who\r\nwas appointed master of music of the Imperial Chapel. In December, 1854,\r\nhis sacred trilogy of the _Childhood of Christ_, completed and\r\nremodelled, was given with great success, and if it was performed but\r\ntwice, it was only because Berlioz,—he had taken great care to announce\r\nit in advance,—was on the point of departing for Gotha, Weimar, and\r\nBrussels, where there was great eagerness to hear this new work. He\r\nreturned to Paris the following March, and on the evening of April 30,\r\n1855, the day preceding the Universal Exposition, he gave in Saint\r\nEustache church the first performance of his grand _Te Deum_ for three\r\nchoruses, orchestra and organ. Afterwards when it became a question of\r\nengraving it, Berlioz was able to see how greatly he was admired in\r\nforeign lands, for the first subscribers were the kings of Hanover,\r\nSaxony, Prussia, the emperor of Russia, the king of Belgium and the\r\nqueen of England. The following year he published a final and much\r\nenlarged edition of his excellent _Treatise on Modern Instrumentation\r\nand Orchestration_, originally brought out in 1844; he dedicated this\r\nwork to the king of Prussia. On the 21st of June, 1856, after four\r\n_tours de scrutin_, he was nominated member of the Académie des\r\nBeaux-Arts, replacing Adolphe Adam, who had refused to vote for him two\r\nyears before and had helped to form the majority in favor of Clapisson.\r\nThe following years were spent by Berlioz in organizing concerts at\r\nWeimar and in England, and above all in the composition of the great\r\nwork on which he built his supreme hope of success in France, his\r\ntragedy of _Les Troyens_. Since 1856 he had been invited every year to\r\nBaden by Bénazet, contractor for the gaming tables, to organize grand\r\nconcerts for the benefit of the visitors. Thus when the king of Baden,\r\nas Bénazet was called, concluded to build a new entertainment hall, it\r\noccurred to him at once that it would be a fine idea to get Berlioz to\r\nwrite something for its inauguration, and the latter, from the first\r\nmention of the subject, felt a reawakening of the desire which had been\r\nhaunting him for thirty years, to write a comic opera, at once\r\nsentimental and gay, on certain scenes arranged by himself after\r\nShakespeare’s comedy _Much Ado About Nothing_. He acquitted himself of\r\nthis agreeable task by fits and starts; the performance of the work at\r\nBaden took place three days sooner than he hoped, and the success was\r\ngreat enough with that cosmopolitan audience, in which the French\r\npredominated, to find an immediate echo at Paris. The following year\r\nMesdames Viardot and Vendenheuvel-Duprez sang the delicious nocturne\r\nwhich closes the first act. For an instant Berlioz indulged in the hope\r\nthat they were going to play his bit of comedy at the Opéra Comique, and\r\nin this fond hope he wrote two more things and had them engraved; but he\r\nwas soon obliged to recognize that it would be impossible with such a\r\ndirector as Emile Perrin, and so thought no more about it. Besides, he\r\nwas entirely occupied with his dear _Troyens_ and the production of this\r\nbeloved work absorbed his every thought. In 1857 he was all in the heat\r\nof the composition; he talked about his antique tragedy to M. Bennett,\r\nto Auguste Morel, to Hans von Bülow; in default of the music he read his\r\npoem at the salons, sometimes at M. Edouard Bertin’s house, sometimes at\r\nhis own, and everywhere he received the warmest congratulations. At a\r\nsoirée at the Tuileries, the Empress spoke to him at length in regard to\r\nit, and immediately he proposed to read his poems to the sovereigns if\r\nthe Emperor could find an hour to give him, but not until three acts\r\nwere completed, so that they might order the immediate study of it at\r\nthe Opéra. Alas, the Emperor, unlearned in matters of music, did not\r\nrespond favorably to Berlioz’s demands; he took no notice of his poem,\r\nand did not give the longed-for order to mount _Les Troyens_ at the\r\n_Opéra_. But while Berlioz was chafing with impatience at seeing _La\r\nFavorite_ and _Lucie_, translated by Alphonse Royer, played over and\r\nover again, and Halévy’s _La Magicienne_ and Félicien David’s\r\n_Herculanum_ pass him by, the Emperor, through the solicitations of the\r\nprincess Metternich, opened the doors of the _Opéra_ to Richard Wagner,\r\nand decreed that his _Tannhäuser_ should be given with great pomp and\r\nmagnificence.\r\n\r\nThe blow was a cruel one, and Berlioz, beside himself with rage and\r\ndisappointment, attacked this unexpected rival and his opera with a fury\r\nthat knew no bounds. He did not understand, unhappy man, that his cause\r\nwas closely allied to that of Richard Wagner; the public, influenced by\r\nsuch critics as Scudo, Jouvin, Lasalle, Azevedo and Chadeuil, was\r\nequally hard on both of them and classed them together as a couple of\r\ndangerous madmen; no distinction was made between the two. The fall of\r\n_Tannhäuser_, towards which Berlioz had worked with all his energies,\r\nresulted in closing to him the stage of the Opéra, and it also assured\r\nin advance the unpopularity of _les Troyens_ with the public ready to\r\nextol or condemn the two innovators without discrimination. Moreover he\r\nsaw Gounod, Gevaert and many others gain access to the Opéra in\r\npreference to himself. At last quite worn out with disappointment,\r\nBerlioz decided to accept the offers of M. Carvalho. This manager had\r\njust reopened the _Théâtre-Lyrique_ and wished to make a great hit in\r\norder to obtain from the government a subsidy of a hundred thousand\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nBut it was no longer a question of playing the whole of _les Troyens_ at\r\nthe _Théâtre-Lyrique_; they would content themselves now with playing\r\nthe first three acts, subdivided into five, under the title of _les\r\nTroyens à Carthage_. The first part of the work Berlioz had published as\r\n_la Prise de Troie_, but he never heard it performed. _Les Troyens à\r\nCarthage_ was given at the _Théâtre-Lyrique_ Nov. 4, 1863, and scored a\r\nfailure, although nothing particularly hostile or unpleasant occurred on\r\nthe opening night; the poor author even entertained faint hopes of\r\nfuture success. It was the cumulative effect of the scornful articles in\r\nnearly all the large newspapers, the ridicule of the smaller press and\r\nof the theatrical parodies, above all the absolute indifference of the\r\npublic, leaving his cherished work to drag itself miserably through a\r\nscore of performances, that disheartened Berlioz and killed him. His\r\nwhole life, indeed, had hung upon this last hope of success, and with\r\nthe conviction of genius, at the close of the general rehearsal he had\r\nexclaimed with tears coursing freely down his cheeks, “It is beautiful,\r\nit is sublime!” He retired to his house and lived there, taciturn,\r\ndesolate, seeing only a few chosen friends who tried to console him, and\r\ncared for like a child by his mother-in-law; he had buried his second\r\nwife (June, 1862) by the side of the first, in Montmartre cemetery.\r\n\r\nThanks to the income from his compositions he was able to give up his\r\npost of musical critic of the _Débats_, which had become insupportable\r\nto him, and was made an officer of the Legion of Honor. He had been a\r\nchevalier for twenty-four years, having been appointed by M. de Gasparin\r\nin 1839, six months before the performance of _Romeo and Juliet_. At\r\nParis he found some consolation in listening to selections from the\r\n_Childhood of Christ_ at the concerts of the _Conservatoire_, and in\r\nseeing people give serious attention to his compositions and sometimes\r\napplaud them heartily, at the Popular Concerts recently founded by\r\nPasdeloup. Only two or three times did he consent to go out of France;\r\nonce to direct the _Damnation of Faust_ at Vienna, whither he was\r\ninvited by Herbeck, court capellmeister; once to conduct the _Harold_\r\nSymphony at Cologne by the invitation of Ferdinand Hiller; finally to\r\nSt. Petersburg at the very urgent solicitations of the grand duchess\r\nHelen, an enthusiastic admirer of his works. But on the eve of his\r\ndeparture he learned of the death of his son Louis in a distant country.\r\nIt was a terrible blow to Berlioz, who was devotedly attached to this\r\nson, a frail, dissipated youth, always discontented with his lot, and\r\nlittle more than a source of anxiety to his father. He set out for St.\r\nPetersburg with a broken heart, and though overwhelmed with successes\r\nand triumphs, entertained and received like a friend by his young\r\nadmirer, the grand duchess, he felt his health failing and his strength\r\nleaving him day by day. On his return he went south, thinking that the\r\nMediterranean might have a beneficial effect upon his health and\r\nspirits; but twice while walking on the beach, once at Monaco,\r\nafterwards at Nice, he was attacked with vertigo, and fell fainting to\r\nthe ground. He returned to Paris, and at the end of two months believed\r\nhimself cured of these fainting spells, but the nervous trouble\r\nincreased daily. He still had desire and strength enough left to drag\r\nhimself to Grenoble in August, 1868, to attend a musical solemnity at\r\nwhich he was made honorary president by his colleagues, who were proud\r\nof him at last. This was the end; on Monday morning the 8th of March,\r\n1869, Hector Berlioz quietly and painlessly breathed his last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HECTOR BERLIOZ.\r\n\r\n  Reproduced from a Russian photograph, selected by von Bulow as being\r\n    the best likeness of Berlioz in his later years.\r\n]\r\n\r\nJust a year later the conversion of the public to Berlioz music was\r\naccomplished by means of a grand festival at the _Opéra_ in honor of the\r\nmaster, organized by his disciple Ernest Reyer. Even up to this time it\r\nwas possible to hear Berlioz’s music only at the Popular Concerts, and\r\nthen often in the midst of confusion and protestations. The announcement\r\nof this concert gave rise to many pleasantries, and people agreed, with\r\nnods and chuckles, that the best way to pay honor to such a man was to\r\nplay music as unlike his as possible. However, the festival took place\r\non the day appointed, with a program made up entirely of the master’s\r\nworks, and some of the pieces, such as the _Waltz of the Sylphs_, and\r\nthe _Hungarian March_, caused the liveliest surprise. They had come to\r\nlaugh and they listened; they even applauded, and better than with the\r\ntips of their fingers. This was the signal for a reaction, and from that\r\nday the sudden change of opinion was only intensified as the musical\r\npublic, who had hitherto tolerated only a few selections, familiarized\r\nthemselves with the superb creations of this master and insisted on\r\nhearing successively all his complete works.\r\n\r\nHis wonderful _La Damnation de Faust_ in particular, so little\r\nappreciated at first, finally had an amazing success and an irresistible\r\nattraction for the crowd, perhaps because the result was assisted by two\r\nor three concert performances. But there is nothing half-way about a\r\nFrench audience, it has no lukewarm sentiments, and it praises as\r\nimmoderately as it condemns. Having once taken the stand, it accepted\r\nand applauded everything from Berlioz’s pen, and when it had exhausted\r\nmere bravos, it easily persuaded itself to erect a monument to his\r\nmemory. First it was a question of a simple bust to be placed upon his\r\ntomb in Montmartre Cemetery, then it was proposed to erect a statue to\r\nhim in his native city; but Paris did not wish to do less than\r\nCôte-Saint-André, and so it happened that Alfred Lénoir’s statue of the\r\ncomposer was erected in Vintimille square near the rue de Calais, the\r\nquarter where he spent a long period of his life and where he died. An\r\nexact duplicate of the statue was erected at Côte-Saint-André in 1890,\r\nand surely two statues are not too many to honor the great artist of\r\nwhom Auber said with a little spice of wickedness,—“Yes, this Berlioz is\r\ncertainly worth something, but what a pity that his education began so\r\nlate.”\r\n\r\nTo-day Berlioz is at the topmost height of fame, and this renown he has\r\nachieved by one work. To the whole musical world he is the composer of\r\n_La Damnation de Faust_, and neither _Romeo et Juliette_, nor _L’Enfance\r\ndu Christ_, nor the _Requiem_, each a masterpiece in its way, has\r\nobtained the widespread success of the first-named work. It is singular\r\nthat a purely orchestral composition, _La Symphony Fantastique_, should\r\nbe accorded a second rank in the general judgment. Strictly speaking,\r\nthis symphony and _La Damnation_ present, outside the music written by\r\nhim for the stage, the quintessence of Berlioz’s genius. They are the\r\ntwo poles between which his affluent inspiration oscillates. In the\r\nformer of these scores is to be found all the romantic exuberance of\r\nyouth; the fury of a latent rebellion against discipline and yet wholly\r\nmaster of itself; a dazzling wealth of instrumentation; a poetic and\r\ndelightful coloring. In the other, of which the style is more varied,\r\nburst forth a passion, an irony, a burning heat, a prodigious intuition\r\nof the effects of vast numbers, a fantastic raillery, a power of\r\ndramatic expression without equal. It is none the less true that genius\r\nradiates from many pages of his other works: the _Pilgrim’s March_ in\r\n_Harold_: the _Offertory_ and the _Tuba Mirum_ in the _Requiem_; the\r\n_Repose of the Holy Family_ in _L’Enfance du Christ_; the _Night of the\r\nBall_, and the _Love Scene_ from _Roméo et Juliette_; the nocturne-duet\r\nfrom _Béatrice et Bénédict_; the love-duet, the quintet and the septet\r\nin _Les Troyens_ are all bright inspirations among creations of the\r\nhighest worth, that met with great favor, although the works of which\r\nthey are a part had not the power to win the masses as they were won by\r\n_La Symphonie Fantastique_ and _La Damnation de Faust_. These last\r\ngratify the public taste (using the term in its broadest acceptation)\r\nbecause they are not merely concert music, but have a close affinity\r\nwith the stage, in the dramatic stories they illustrate. I believe that\r\nthe minute descriptive programme which Berlioz has attached to _La\r\nSymphonie Fantastique_ has been largely instrumental in assuring the\r\nsuccess of this work with a public that mentally follows the imaginary\r\ndrama, step by step as the orchestra depicts the various episodes; now\r\nmelodramatic, now rustic, now loving, sanguinary and demoniac. Such is\r\nstill more the case with _La Damnation de Faust_. Berlioz’s work has\r\ncertainly benefited by the attention drawn to Goethe’s poem by M.\r\nGounod’s opera; the great mass of the public knew nothing of the\r\noriginal when _La Damnation_ was first heard by them in 1846. Nowadays\r\nmusic lovers everywhere are equally well informed on this point; they\r\nunderstood, from the time that the opera was given, the meaning of what\r\nwas recited to them by Berlioz’s singers, clad in black dress suits and\r\nwhite neckties; they filled in the gaps in his libretto from what the\r\nopera of Faust taught them; they compared number with number; in fact,\r\nby reason of placing side by side two works so widely unlike each other,\r\nthey learned to appreciate the warm, passionate and magnificent power of\r\nBerlioz’s older composition. Thus little by little this product of\r\ngenius has forced itself on general admiration as the model on which\r\nGounod’s Faust was planned.\r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to proclaim _La Damnation de Faust_ a work of\r\ngenius, and it excites all the more admiration when we know that certain\r\nnumbers, among others, the scene in which Faust is lulled to sleep by\r\nelfins, came from the brain of a composer only twenty-five years old,\r\nand appeared almost perfect in the _Huit scènes de Faust_ which Berlioz\r\npublished in 1829, not being able to have it performed, and which he\r\ndedicated to M. de Larochefoucauld. This fine scene, therefore, dates\r\nback to 1828, as does the beautiful song _La Fête de Pâques_ and also\r\nthe joyous rondo sung by the peasants. In fact, not only the grand\r\nchoruses, but the shorter pieces, the songs of _Le Rat_ and of _La\r\nPuce_; the ballad, _Le Roi de Thule_; the romance of Marguerite, joined\r\narbitrarily to the soldiers’ chorus and _La Sérenade du diable_ are all\r\nfragments of his youthful work that Berlioz retained in the score of his\r\nmaturer period and had the skill to combine anew in several scenes of\r\nextraordinary poetic beauty and richness of effect. How inspired the\r\npretty rustic scene into which he has inserted, judiciously or\r\notherwise, his admirable _Rakoczy March_, written to gain the good will\r\nof the Hungarians; the superb monologue of the doctor, introducing the\r\nEaster chorus; the animated scene at the Auerbach tavern with its\r\nbizarre songs and the ironical fugue on the word _Amen_; the marvellous\r\nscene on the banks of the Elbe with the fine appeal to the demon; the\r\ndelightful slumber chorus of the spirits and the exquisite ballet of the\r\nsylphs; the double chorus of students. Does it not seem that they were\r\nall conceived, composed and written down at a white heat and without a\r\npause between them? How fascinating and impressive appears the really\r\ndevilish serenade of Mephisto, the charming _Ménuet des Follets_ after\r\nthe ecstatic air of Faust, the archaic ballad of Marguerite, the\r\nextremely tender love-duet, and the grand final trio with its chorus of\r\nneighbors. The last part is, from beginning to end, absolutely above\r\ncriticism. It opens with Marguerite’s sad lament interrupted by the\r\nchorus of students and leads up to the sublime invocation of nature; to\r\nthe fantastic path of the abyss; to the lovely song of Seraphim after\r\nthe furious suggestions of hell. What a splendid culmination!\r\n\r\nSurely _La Damnation de Faust_ is a masterpiece; but _Roméo et Juliette_\r\nis another and should have enjoyed as great a success. That it did not\r\nis perhaps owing to the fact that in Berlioz’s symphony, vocal music has\r\nonly a small place, the instruments alone translating the sentiments of\r\nthe characters, the two not being in juxtaposition as they are in many\r\nof the familiar operas of _Romeo and Juliet_ by Gounod and others which\r\nought to have led to an appreciation of Berlioz’s score. The seven\r\nmovements that form this composition are all of marked worth and are\r\nappropriate to the strange plan of the work. In the first place, the\r\nprologue, imitated from Shakespeare, and of which M. Gounod, later,\r\nadopted Berlioz’s idea, presents a résumé of the work at once complete,\r\ngrand and delightful, and comprises the fine verses that Berlioz,\r\nstrangely enough, caused to be sung by a Muse in honor of Shakespeare\r\nand Poetry. The opening part includes three incomparable numbers: the\r\npoetic and piquantly agitated revery of Romeo wandering in the garden\r\nduring the ball; the love scene between Juliet and Romeo, a masterpiece\r\nof orchestration; the Queen Mab movement, a model of fantastic airiness;\r\nalso three numbers in the second part, the funeral of Juliet, with its\r\npenetrating sadness; the death of Romeo, in which Berlioz has given free\r\nrein to his passion for descriptive music, and the oath of\r\nreconciliation, preceded by a stirring recitative and the noble prayer\r\nof the monk. These are so many magnificent fragments, which, placed side\r\nby side according to the composer’s design, form a creation of a wholly\r\nsuperior order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HECTOR BERLIOZ.\r\n\r\n  From an engraving by Auguste Hüssener.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter _Faust_ and _Romeo_, comes the _Requiem_,—another triumph; a\r\nromantic composition of the first class, written with feverish\r\nenthusiasm by a master who rather sought to paint a striking picture to\r\neach line of the _Requiem_ than to probe to the literal sense of the\r\nLatin text. The _Kyrie_ is the least eccentric and the most expressive\r\nnumber. The _Tuba Mirum_, in particular, produces a tremendous effect\r\nwith its four orchestras of brass; an idea that Félicien David and Verdi\r\nborrowed from this. Berlioz has given to the _Lacrymosa_ a searching\r\npathos. Perhaps the finest movement in the work to which Schumann\r\nrendered such ample justice, is the _Offertorium_. The requiem ends with\r\na _Sanctus_ for tenor solo, seraphic in sentiment, followed by a\r\nbeautiful _Agnus_ and a lovely, unfugued _Amen_. It is fitting to bring\r\ntogether, for comparison, this composition and the _Te Deum_ written\r\nabout 1850, of which the finest page is the hymn of the seraphim, _Tibi\r\nomnes angeli_, that rises to a magnificent crescendo and dies away at\r\nthe close on a long and distant chord of the organ. The prayer for tenor\r\nsolo, _Te ergo quæsumus_ is equally perfect, and the final chorus is a\r\nmajestic number to which Berlioz has attached a brilliant and thrilling\r\ntriumphal march for the “presentation of flags.” It recalls by the\r\nvastness of its proportions and its orchestral massiveness, his\r\n_Symphonie funèbre et triumphale_, so much admired by Richard Wagner,\r\nand of which the peroration, entitled _Apothéose_, forced a flattering\r\nexclamation of praise from even the savage Habeneck.\r\n\r\nThe _Symphonie Fantastique_, to return to the most applauded work of\r\nBerlioz, after _Faust_, is one of the most bizarre eccentricities ever\r\nhatched in a composer’s brain; but it is also one of the most\r\nimpressive. The first movement, _Rêveries-passions_, at once so sad and\r\ntender, is, however, excelled by the _Scène aux champs_, which soothes\r\nand charms us with its peacefulness. It is the most inspired movement of\r\nthe symphony. _Le Bal_ and the _Marche au supplice_ are aflame with the\r\nextraordinary verve of the composer, who, taking motives that are\r\nneither very striking nor very original in themselves, develops them\r\nwith extraordinary power, and with such fullness that each movement\r\nattains an almost incredible expressiveness. Though in the _Songe d’une\r\nnuit de Sabbat_, the _Dies Iræ_ is burlesqued and degraded by the\r\nmocking accents of the piccolo, the tinkling of bells, the bellowing of\r\nophicleides, yet this last part produces an irresistible effect and\r\ndrags the hearer along in the train of the hellish turmoil. In _Harold\r\nen Italie_ Berlioz pushes this seeking for extremely varied tone-colors,\r\nand unexpected contrasts, and curious surprises for the ear so far, that\r\nhe frequently falls into excess. The fine _Marche des Pélerins_ has\r\neclipsed the other portions of the symphony, but the first movement,\r\n_Harold aux montagnes_, is full of poetic melancholy, and the _Serénade\r\nd’un montagnard_, breathes a tranquil peace with which the fiery and\r\ntumultuous _Orgie de brigands_ forms a powerful, nay, almost exaggerated\r\ncontrast.\r\n\r\nIn the exquisite religious legend _L’Enfance du Christ_, and the\r\ngraceful opera comique, _Béatrice et Bénédict_ we make the acquaintance\r\nof a Berlioz tempered by age and who no longer seeks to “make a noise in\r\nthe world.” The second part of his oratorio-drama _La Fuite en Egypte_,\r\nis universally known through its delightful chorus of shepherds and its\r\nlovely tenor recitative; there is also much charm in the first duet of\r\nMary and Joseph as they watch over Jesus. The third part includes a\r\npowerfully dramatic scene in which the fugitives knock in vain at every\r\ndoor, followed by a patriarchal scene with the beautiful phrase of the\r\nfather of the family welcoming Jesus, and the trio, with two flutes and\r\nharps, of young Ishmaelites. This is music that delights the world. It\r\nis the same with the famous duet-nocturne in _Béatrice et Bénédict_,\r\nwhose beauty dwells in the opening strain of Hero’s air, and in the\r\nsplendid andante, à la Gluck, sung by Beatrice. What gaiety, perhaps a\r\nlittle forced now and then, emanates from the mocking duet between\r\nBeatrice and Benedict; from the trio of men and the trio of women. What\r\nexquisite sweetness there is in the _Chant d’hyménée_ heard from afar;\r\nwhat verve in the piquant rondo sung at the close by the reconciled\r\nlovers!\r\n\r\n_Benvenuto Cellini_, a work that has never been revived, is not one of\r\nthe finer achievements of Berlioz; in it we meet too many concessions to\r\nthe virtuosity of the conventional opera prima-donna, but it is pervaded\r\nby a spirit wholly youthful, set off by sparkling instrumentation. The\r\ntrio of the first act, and the sad air of Teresa; the grand quartet in\r\nthe Place Colonne with its different themes ingeniously blended and\r\nstrongly marked; the couplets of Ascanio; the narrative air of Cellini;\r\nthe scene in which the poltroon Fieramosca simulates a duel; the\r\ncharming love-duet between Teresa and Cellini,—here, indeed, are page\r\nafter page of limpid melody that delight their hearers, as did the\r\nopening brilliant overture with the following long carnival scene, which\r\nreproduces with extraordinary effect the mutterings and rumblings of a\r\ncrowd. This is, in truth, the climax of the work. To this opera must be\r\njoined the overture, _Le Carnaval Romain_, written later by Berlioz, and\r\nperhaps the most beautiful of his isolated overtures. In any case, it is\r\nthat which has had the greatest success, eclipsing the overture, _Les\r\nFrancs Juges_, even in Germany where it was at first so much applauded,\r\nas well as the overtures, _Waverly_, _The Corsair_, and _King Lear_, the\r\nlast, though so expressive, having never enjoyed equal favor with _Le\r\nCarnaval Romain_.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy _Les Troyens_, imitated from Virgil, marked the return to\r\nfirst principles made by Berlioz when maturity had calmed the\r\neffervescence of youth and the ebulition of middle age. It was taken up\r\nagain in a moment of classic aspiration and shows how much the teachings\r\nof Lesueur influenced him. _La Prise de Troie_ and _Les Troyens à\r\nCarthage_, separate works, but performed together for the first time at\r\nCarlsruhe in December, 1870, are of equal worth and of a superior order.\r\nIn _La Prise de Troie_ the despairing appeals of Cassandra, the tender\r\nreplies of Corèbe; the fiery choruses, the ballet music, of which the\r\nlocal color is so appropriate; the epic grandeur of the benediction of\r\nAstyanax by Paris; the excited joy of the Trojan people welcoming the\r\nentrance of the wooden horse; the woe-fraught prophecies of Cassandra.\r\nIn _Les Troyens à Carthage_ the peaceful songs of the Trojans; the\r\nsublimely touching melodies of Dido; the caressing responses of Anna;\r\nÆneas’ call to arms, and the stirring orchestral scene of the royal\r\nhunt; the third act, an unmistakable masterpiece, with its pretty dance\r\ntunes, its quintet, its incomparable septet, and its fine love-duet; the\r\nlast two acts, with the sweet plaint of the sailor, Hylas; the pathetic\r\nfarewell of Æneas and the splendid death scene of Dido,—all prove that\r\nboth parts of _Les Troyens_ must be placed in the same rank as two great\r\nworks that blend into one perfect whole.\r\n\r\nBerlioz, in addition to his large symphonic and vocal works, wrote\r\nnumerous detached songs with orchestral or pianoforte accompaniment. _La\r\nCaptive_, which was greatly extended from the original sketch written in\r\nItaly; _Le 5 mai_, a magnificent song glorifying the first Napoleon;\r\n_Sara la baigneuse_, and _La Mort d’Ophélie_, lovely works for two\r\nfemale voices; a fine _Hymne à la France_; _Neuf mélodies Irlandaises_,\r\na youthful effort, inspired by the poems of Thomas Moore; _Les nuits\r\nd’été_, six settings of poems by Théophile Gautier, are the most notable\r\nof this class of compositions. By adding to these the pieces collected\r\nto form _Lelio; Rêverie et Caprice_, for violin solo and orchestra; a\r\ncharming _Meditation religieuse_, after Thomas Moore; and a striking\r\n_Marche Funêbre_ for the interment of Hamlet; we have enumerated all the\r\nworks of Berlioz, great and small, that are worth remembering.\r\n\r\nThe true domain of Berlioz, that in which he is really king, is the\r\norchestra. He gave an extraordinary impetus to the art of\r\ninstrumentation,—even after Beethoven and Weber, on whom he leaned,—by\r\nhis marvellous instinct for blending the various timbres of orchestral\r\ninstruments, by his indefatigable search for new combinations of tone,\r\nby his constant effort to add to the power and the expressiveness of the\r\norchestra in order to make it translate the most diverse sentiments,\r\nthus giving to his music a stronger relief, a more animated color. The\r\nprodigious result was, that he almost recreated the art of\r\norchestration, opened a new horizon to it, and therefore deserves the\r\ntitle of the French Beethoven. Is it not also astonishing that his\r\ngenius, audaciously innovating in regard to instrumentation, exercised\r\nan influence not only on all those musicians who began their career\r\nafter his success was established, but on others who were his elders by\r\nage and reputation, such as Meyerbeer, or somewhat younger, such as\r\nRichard Wagner? These two composers, not the least able of their day,\r\nhaving heard the works of Berlioz at a time when very few took him\r\nseriously, had an intuition of his worth and from the very first felt\r\ninstinctively even more than Schumann, that it was necessary to respect\r\nthis young man gifted with such extraordinary imagination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARICATURE OF BERLIOZ.\r\n\r\n  By Benjamin—Nov. 1, 1838.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThenceforward Meyerbeer, one of those rare musicians, be it said to his\r\nhonor, who feel a concern for other creations than their own, took a\r\nlively and permanent interest in all that Berlioz produced. Wagner, on\r\nhis side, admitted to friends that he no sooner reached Paris than he\r\nmade a profound study of Berlioz’s instrumentation; that he had since\r\nreread his scores many times, and that he had often profited by the\r\nworks of “that devilishly clever man.” Moreover, from 1841, he regarded\r\nBerlioz as a musician filling a place of his own, mingling with none,\r\nwhile loving, understanding, worshipping Beethoven; dreaming perhaps to\r\nbe German in the hours when his genius urged him to write in imitation\r\nof this great master; but unable to assimilate French love of external\r\neffect with Beethoven’s profound symphonic style; possessing a wonderful\r\nfancy, an imagination of extraordinary energy; torn between his artistic\r\nimpulses and the tastes of his fellow countrymen, whom he wished to win;\r\nincapable of asking or of receiving advice; possessed of that virtue,\r\nrare even among Germans, of not wishing to write for money; turning his\r\nback on all musical triviality; eminently fitted by reason of these\r\nqualities and of these faults to create great works, popular or national\r\nas in the _Symphonie de Juillet_, the best in his eyes, of Berlioz’s\r\nworks, and the only one which, to him, seemed destined to live.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARICATURE OF BERLIOZ.\r\n\r\n  By Carjat.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe portrait is pretty, and coming from the pen of Wagner, is flattering\r\nenough, save in its conclusion, which appears somewhat absurd to-day.\r\nBut this amazing aptitude for obtaining from an orchestra more than any\r\nother composer had been able to compass, was exactly the origin of the\r\nmisunderstanding between Berlioz and the public. Certainly the so-called\r\nlearned criticisms of the most serious journals and the chaffing of the\r\nless dignified press, contributed much to transform Berlioz, in the eye\r\nof the masses, into a species of charlatan hungry for fame and banging\r\nhis drum vigorously to attract the mob; denying him genius except for\r\ndrawing attention to himself. These slurs, however, would not have taken\r\na firm hold in the minds of their readers if the adverse criticisms had\r\nbeen wholly without an appearance of justice. In brief, with what did\r\nthey reproach him? of lacking melodic invention and of replacing it by\r\ninextricable orchestral tangles; of rejoicing in diabolical noise and of\r\nentertaining a positive contempt for all music except his own.\r\nNevertheless, Berlioz was not wanting in melody. His themes, when\r\nseparated from their complicated accompaniments, have even a family\r\nlikeness to the romanzas of 1840 in the style of Madame Duchambage or of\r\nBlangini; his themes, vocal or instrumental, have generally a dreamy\r\nmelancholy, which seem to recall his birthplace, with its tender and\r\ntremulous songs so loved by the peasants of Dauphiny. These perfectly\r\nclear melodies, whenever he was content to give them simple\r\naccompaniments, met with instant recognition and success from the\r\npublic. Among them is _La Captive_ in its first version; also the tenor\r\nrecitative in _La Fuite en Egypte_. It seemed surprising that the\r\ncomposer of these delicate melodies should be the one who wrote such\r\ncomplicated music, and so the ignorant were taught that these melodic\r\ntreasure-troves were wholly exceptional with this troublesome, demented\r\nand blustering composer.\r\n\r\nWhat repelled the public and assisted its misunderstanding on this\r\npoint, were the intricacies of his deeply-studied and curiously-strange\r\nmethod of orchestration. In carrying out the idea that by the aid of the\r\nmost varied tone combinations every shade of meaning in a piece of music\r\ncan be made clear to the listener, Berlioz, imbued as he was with the\r\nteachings of Lesueur, had a tendency to overcharge the more novel\r\ntouches of his musical picture, in order to indicate the secondary\r\ndetails with that distinctness which seemed indispensable to him. From\r\nthis practice arose confusion in the mind of the inexperienced hearer,\r\nand produced cloudiness in the music from which the dominant idea could\r\nnot be detached without an effort. On the other hand he gave utterance\r\nto many noble and touching thoughts with pathetic declamation, poetic\r\nand richly-colored orchestration, and impressive sonority; essential\r\nqualities in Berlioz that are really wonderful and on which his enemies,\r\nnotably Fétis, were careful not to throw light. On the contrary, they\r\ndid their uttermost to discourage the public from bestowing attention on\r\nthese works, and they succeeded only too well and too long.\r\n\r\nHere then is one of the causes that made amateurs rebel, on principle,\r\nagainst the innovations of this great composer; but another cause,\r\ninherent in the soul of Berlioz, repelled timid people. It was his\r\nspirit of intolerance and of exclusive self-admiration. Carried along by\r\nthe impulse of the time and the desire to insure victory for his art\r\ntheories, Berlioz did not hesitate to attack the reputations of the most\r\ncherished idols of the hour; therefore, whether he wrote, or whether he\r\nspoke, he indulged his natural disposition to exaggerate everything with\r\nvirulent indignation, and outbursts of mad enthusiasm in support of the\r\nartistic faith that swayed him. The public did not and could not\r\nunderstand him, and irritated by his fierce aggressive tone, held itself\r\ninstinctively on guard against the creations of this fighting innovator\r\nand stood ready to pay him the price of his contempt for it. Between a\r\nrancorous public offended by the disdain this iconoclast manifested for\r\nits tastes, and an artist who never exhausted the taunts he had in store\r\nfor it, there was always an antagonism, skilfully intensified by the\r\npersonal foes of the master and which ceased only at his death.\r\n\r\nAntagonism is the true word, for Berlioz in his vocal works at least\r\nnever departed from the models so dear to the public. In fact, so far as\r\nopera is concerned, he remained ever the disciple and admirer of\r\nSpontini and of Gluck, without dreaming that he was destined soon to\r\ninitiate a revolution in this branch of musical art. Even when, at the\r\nheight of his own romantic fervor, he broke down the barriers of the\r\nsymphony, there always remained in Berlioz an instinctive respect for\r\nconsecrated forms; and as soon as he passed from the concert-room to the\r\nstage he conformed in the most ingenious manner imaginable to the old\r\nmethods in all his works written with an eye to the opera house. He was\r\ndeliberately revolutionary in the symphony only, and that chiefly in\r\nrespect to instrumentation.\r\n\r\nWith this creator, endowed with a phenomenal genius in a certain way,\r\nthe ideas regarding the essential conditions of musical art were so\r\nunsettled, and changed so often from one time and from one style to\r\nanother, that he would have been puzzled to formulate them with any\r\nexactness. He emitted fire and flames, he hurled curses and roared\r\nbitter denunciations, but when it came to deciding the ideal that an\r\nartist should follow or the absolute principles he should adopt, he did\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThere exists a radical difference between the two great musicians who\r\nhave convulsed the musical world in the second half of this century. The\r\nlater-comer, Richard Wagner, pursued a fully defined ideal, a single\r\nproblem, on the solving of which he had long concentrated his thoughts\r\nand all the force of his genius, viz.:—the fusion of music and the\r\ndrama. He kept steadily in this one path and brought the music-drama to\r\nthe highest point it is possible for it to attain. Berlioz, on the\r\ncontrary, realized at one stroke all the modifications that seemed to\r\nhim desirable to fasten upon the symphony and the opera. He did not seek\r\nan integral reform, but simply wished to enrich each branch of musical\r\nart with new descriptive and picturesque elements. But while his\r\nflexible brain turned now toward the stage, now toward the church, or\r\nthe concert-room, he did not deviate much from the traditional forms,\r\nthough he endowed them with new and wonderful characteristics.\r\n\r\nWarmly romantic with Shakespeare, purely classic with Virgil, who were\r\nhis literary deities, he was eclectic in literature as in music. The\r\nsplendid lyric accents of Gluck are not in full harmony with the deep\r\npoetic and chivalric inspiration of Weber, and the lack of resemblance\r\nbetween Spontini and Beethoven is still more striking, yet Berlioz loved\r\nthem all. It matters not that Berlioz confounded these masters in his\r\nreligious admiration of them and made for himself a double personality,\r\nrepudiating all rule and tradition when he wrote for the orchestra and\r\nfor the concert stage, and becoming a pious observer of hallowed forms\r\nwhen he turned to the theatre. In his _Les Troyens_, the voice parts are\r\nof a wholly classic purity while the orchestra abounds in modern\r\nromanticism; in _Béatrice et Bénédict_, delightful inspirations,\r\nexquisite in their poetry, are mingled with the conventional forms that\r\nBerlioz mercilessly condemned in the works of others: inexplicable vocal\r\nflourishes, repetitions of words, outrages on prosody, the clipping of\r\nrebellious words; all this by a composer in whose eyes correct\r\ndeclamation was a fundamental essential of song.\r\n\r\nSuch was the composer Berlioz, such the critic, and the critic was not\r\nunhelpful to the composer. In fact, all that he was in France, all that\r\nhe was able to win, during his lifetime, he owed to his position as a\r\nwriter for the press and as the friend of influential journalists. But\r\nhe made many enemies, less by the aggressiveness of his writings than by\r\nhis caustic wit. There was in him an imperative necessity to tell the\r\npublic his hates and his loves, and if he did not always feel free to\r\ngive bold expression to the disgust with which certain works filled him,\r\nhe invariably let his contempt be seen through his polished and even\r\nlaudatory phrases. At least, nobody was ever deceived. The musician in\r\nBerlioz is impassioned, now tender, now vigorous. It is the same with\r\nthe writer. His style is picturesque and incisive, sometimes trivial.\r\nSide by side are exclamations of admiration and contempt; quasi\r\nreligious respect and genuinely holy anger, all equally energetic and\r\nsincere—the word and the blow. To appreciate this at its full value, it\r\nsuffices to select at hazard one of the collection of articles published\r\nby himself in book form under the titles, _Les Soirées de l’orchestra,\r\nLes Grotesques de la musique_, in which the humorist tone prevails and\r\n_A travers chants_, which contains his most serious thoughts; the two\r\nvolumes of letters published after his death, _Correspondance inédite et\r\nlettres intimes_; and finally his amusing and fascinating _Mémoires_, in\r\nwhich he travesties himself unreservedly and confuses somewhat the dates\r\nand facts. This book is a genuine romance.\r\n\r\nBerlioz, bitter and unsympathetic as it here pleases him to appear, was\r\nwholly unconventional; he was the athlete constantly stripped for the\r\ncombat, and armed for the fight. How different from the Berlioz seen in\r\nhis profession and in society! As much as those, who knowing him but\r\nslightly, judged him hard and unsociable, so much did those to whom his\r\naffections went out, laud his extreme kindness and his tenderness of\r\nfeeling. He was not prepossessing in appearance or manner. His esteem\r\nand friendship had to be won little by little, in order to open by some\r\nmeans or other, the way to his heart. He no sooner found himself among\r\nfriends, than his spirits rose and often urged him into countless\r\npleasantries. Nevertheless, even toward these he showed the most\r\nvariable disposition: he would arrive sullen and morose, and then\r\nwithout warning, would break into wild and infectious gaiety, to fall\r\njust as suddenly into icy reserve. A troublesome thought would suffice\r\nfor this, and it only needed an inopportune word to make him\r\nintractable. If he chanced to be in the mood for brilliant paradoxes or\r\nmerry persiflage, it was necessary to refrain from interrupting or\r\nopposing him. In the heat of conversation, no matter how serious, he\r\nloved to utter wretched puns, and absurd verbal extravagances. These\r\nirrepressible sallies, at which he was generally the only one to laugh,\r\nwere something very serious in his eyes. “Genius is akin to madness.”\r\n\r\n“Berlioz, one of the most eminent musicians of all time, perhaps the\r\nmost extraordinary artist in every way who ever lived.” Thus he was\r\ncharacterized by M. Reyer in speaking at the foot of Berlioz’s statue.\r\nHe was, truly, an extraordinary artist in every sense; apostle and\r\nsectarian at one and the same time; one who conceived great things and\r\nsometimes partly realized them; who was in turn sarcastic and\r\nsentimental, emotional and passionate almost to weeping; who nourished\r\nan intolerant worship of his art and never knew moderation in his\r\njudgments; who was gifted with admirable creative faculties and opened\r\nnew paths to the art of instrumentation; who was in perpetual strife\r\nwith the pretenders of true melody, to whom he never yielded; who aimed\r\nto be at once as noble and as majestic as Spontini, as imaginative and\r\nas impassioned as Weber, as sweet and as tender as Virgil, as sublime\r\nand as trivial as Shakespeare, as grand and pathetic as Goethe and\r\nBeethoven, yet who knew how to be himself by force of will and loftiness\r\nof genius. Berlioz had a rare grasp of mind, and was keenly sensitive to\r\nthe beauties of certain great literary works, hence the “romantic\r\nmovement” in France deeply influenced him. With enormous will power and\r\nbordering on insanity, he aspired in his youthful dreams to be\r\nconsidered, some day, the Victor Hugo, the Delacroix of musical art,\r\nand, in some respects, his aspiration was more than realized—after he\r\nwas dead!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ad.

In his earliest childhood he developed a talent for\r\nmusic and when only four years of age he began his musical studies.\r\nThree years later he had instruction on the violin and piano, for which\r\nlatter instrument he manifested a special gift, and he was already an\r\nexcellent performer on it, when, in 1828, at the age of seventeen, he\r\nwas admitted to the Paris Conservatoire and became the pupil of\r\nZimmermann in piano playing, of Dourien for harmony, and of Lesueur for\r\ncomposition. Kalkbrenner, then in the height of his fame, took a great\r\ninterest in the boy and aided his study of the piano, while Barbereau\r\ngave him lessons in counterpoint. He was a diligent student, and one\r\nyear after his entrance to the Conservatoire he won the first prize for\r\npiano playing. The year following, he carried off the first prize for\r\nharmony, and two years later the Grand Prix was awarded him; and when\r\nonly twenty-one, he went to Italy at the expense of the State, remaining\r\nthere for the prescribed three years, and studying conscientiously.\r\nDuring this period he wrote a string quintet; a quartet for strings; a\r\ntrio for pianoforte, violin, and ’cello; a fantasia for pianoforte and\r\norchestra; a fantasia on Scotch melodies, for piano; six capriccios in\r\nthe form of waltzes, for piano; two nocturnes for piano, a rondo for\r\nfour hands, for the same instrument; six Italian songs; three motets,\r\nwith organ, and a requiem, with orchestra. These works were all\r\npublished, as was also his prize cantata “Hermann and Ketty.” They are\r\nnow forgotten, but they were then evidences of great industry and of a\r\nleaning in the direction of what was most worthy in the art into which\r\nthe young musician had been born, and they attracted earnest critical\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Paris early in 1836, and at once sought for a hearing at\r\nthe Opéra Comique, the first ambition of a young French composer. He did\r\nnot have long to wait, for in August, 1837, his one-act opera, “La\r\nDouble Echelle,” was performed, and so favorably received that he\r\nobtained a firm foothold at the opera house and produced there “Le\r\nPerruquier de la Régence,” three acts (1838); “Le Panier Fleuri,” one\r\nact (1839). In the meanwhile, encouraged by his success, he aspired to\r\nthe Académie, and in 1839 produced there, in collaboration with Benoist,\r\nLa “Gipsy,” a ballet in two acts. He also composed for the same\r\nestablishment “Le Comte de Carmagnola” (1841); “Le Guerillero” (1842);\r\nand “Betty,” a ballet in two acts (1846). None of these was successful.\r\nAt that time Auber, Halévy, Meyerbeer and Donizetti were composing for\r\nthe Académie, and it was not easy for a young artist to hold his own\r\nagainst them. Thomas had not neglected the Opéra Comique, for which he\r\nwrote “Carline” (1840); “Angélique et Médor” (1843); “Mina” (1843), all\r\nof which failed to make any favorable impression on the public.\r\nDiscouraged by the lack of success that attended his efforts, he ceased\r\nto write for the lyric stage, and for five years remained silent. When\r\nhe was heard again it was in “Le Caïd,” a three-act comic opera, which\r\nwas produced in 1849, and achieved a brilliant success, making a tour of\r\nEurope. It was followed in 1850 by “Le Songe d’une nuit d’été,” in three\r\nacts. This opera was no less fortunate in the reception accorded it, and\r\nat once gave Thomas a foremost place among the young French composers of\r\nthe day. Then came “Raymond,” three acts (1851); “La Tonelli” (1853);\r\n“La Cour de Célimène” (1855); “Psyché” (1857); “Le Carnaval de Venise”\r\n(1857); “Le Roman d’Elvire.” Some of these obtained slight temporary\r\nsuccess, but not one of them won the popularity that attended “Le Caïd”\r\nand “Le Songe.” Again Thomas retired from view, and this time it was six\r\nyears before he produced another opera.\r\n\r\nIn 1851 he became a member of the Institute, and in 1852, Professor of\r\nComposition in the Conservatoire. Up to this time Thomas had\r\ndistinguished himself as a fluent and refined melodist, and by his\r\npiquant orchestration; he was also noted as a master of musical comedy.\r\nNevertheless he had not yet been able to win for himself a rank equal to\r\nthat of Auber, and in French comic opera, “Le Maçon,” “Fra Diavolo,” “Le\r\nDomino Noir,” and “Les Diamants de la Couronne,” which had been composed\r\nbefore Thomas went into his second seclusion, still surpassed all that\r\nthe latter had produced, and survive to this day, while, with the\r\nexception of “Le Caïd,” none of Thomas’s operas antecedent to 1850 are\r\never performed.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 “Mignon” was heard, and Thomas at once leaped to world-wide\r\nfame. The work had an overwhelming success, and has been given in every\r\nopera house in the world. Two years later this masterpiece was followed\r\nby “Hamlet,” which was equally successful in France, though it has not,\r\nelsewhere, proved as popular as “Mignon.” On the strength of these two\r\nfine operas he was appointed, in 1871, to fill the position of Director\r\nof the Conservatoire, left vacant by the death of Auber. His other\r\ncompositions, not yet mentioned, are a cantata composed for the\r\ninauguration of a statue to Lesueur (1852); a “Messe Solennelle” (1857);\r\na “Marche Réligieuse” (1865); “Hommage à Boïeldieu,” composed for the\r\ncentenary of Boïeldieu (1875), and many part songs, among them “La\r\nVapeur,” “Le Chant des Amis,” “Le Tyrol,” “France,” “L’Atlantique,” “Le\r\nCarnaval de Rome,” “Le Traineaux,” “Le Temple de la Paix,” “La Nuit du\r\nSabbat,” some of which are works of the highest merit, in their order.\r\nIn 1874 was produced “Gille et Gilleton,” a one-act comic opera,\r\nwritten, however, in 1861. “Psyché” was revived in 1878 with additions,\r\nbut though the music is full of graceful beauty, and was warmly praised,\r\nit made no marked impression on the general public. After “Hamlet,”\r\nThomas did not bring forward another opera for fourteen years, and then\r\nhe made another brilliant success with “Françoise di Rimini” (1882), in\r\nwhich was some of the finest music he had ever written, especially in\r\nthe prologue and in the fourth act. He was now seventy-one years of age,\r\nand could well rest on the laurels he had won. From that date until the\r\npresent (1893), he has produced no new lyric work, his only contribution\r\nto the stage of the opera being a ballet founded on “The Tempest,” by\r\nShakespeare (1889), which, though remarkable as the effort of a man\r\nseventy-eight years old, was not destined to be numbered among his\r\nsuccesses. In fact, with this work his career as a composer appears to\r\nhave ended. He received the grand Cross of the Legion of Honor in 1880.\r\nAt the age of eighty-two, he is still fulfilling his duties at the\r\nConservatoire, in which institution he has worked many important and\r\nuseful reforms. He has improved the method of instruction, has\r\ninstituted lectures on the general history of music; has founded an\r\norchestral class and compulsory vocal classes for reading at sight, and\r\nhas raised the standard of solfeggio teaching. Not only this, but he has\r\nbeen largely instrumental in increasing the salaries of the professors,\r\nand has enlarged the prosperity of the institution until it has reached\r\na point that makes it almost self-paying. Thomas has lived a wholly\r\nartistic life and has, fortunately, escaped most of the severer trials\r\nexperienced by the majority of those who have devoted themselves to that\r\nbranch of his art which has brought him fame and competence. He is given\r\nto physical exercise, is fond of country life, has a villa at Argenteuil\r\nand an island home at Zillieo, in Brittany. He is not without literary\r\ntalent and his tastes are refined. He is an enthusiastic collector of\r\nbric-a-brac, and rarely fails attendance at any of the more important\r\nauctions at the Hotel Druot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph manuscript of an “Album Leaf” written by Ambroise\r\n    Thomas.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmbroise Thomas’ life as a composer for the Paris opera houses covered\r\nfifty-two years. In that time he wrote much charming music, but he never\r\ndeveloped any individuality of style, never wrote anything so\r\ndistinctively his own that it could at once be attributed to him by\r\nreason of any characteristics belonging peculiarly and distinguishingly\r\nto him. His earlier operas, produced between 1837 and 1848, are marked\r\nby refinement of taste, and graceful finish in workmanship. After that\r\nand until 1860 his method underwent a change, and he sought brilliancy\r\nand piquancy, as instanced in “Le Caïd,” and gradually warmed into\r\npoetic feeling and deeper sentiment, departing, in the meanwhile, from\r\nthe conventionalities that Rossini and other Italian composers had\r\nfastened on French opera music. His growth in his art has been steady\r\nfrom the very outset, but if he has ceased to write after “Le Roman\r\nd’Elvire,” which ended this period of his musical development, his fame\r\nas a composer would hardly have survived down to the present time. From\r\nthe opera just named to “Mignon” was an enormous stride, and the\r\nbrilliant reputation this work made for him was sustained by “Hamlet”\r\nand “Françoise di Rimini.” But even these, his masterpieces, do not\r\npresent him in the light of a composer who had something to say that had\r\nnot been said before. His art evolution had enlarged his method of\r\nthought and had enabled him to give a wider scope to his talents, but it\r\nhad not endowed him with a style that set him apart from other\r\ncomposers. We hear of the style of Auber, and it brings a clear idea of\r\na strongly marked musical individuality to our mind. The same may be\r\nsaid of the style of Meyerbeer and also that of Gounod; but to speak of\r\nthe style of Thomas would be to convey no such distinct and instant\r\nsuggestion of a definite and an unmistakable originality, like that\r\nwhich pertains essentially to Bizet.\r\n\r\nThe music of Thomas is always polished and delicate; his operas show\r\nthat he has an innate feeling for dramatic effect; his musical comedies\r\nare models for the intimate blending of music with the spirit of the\r\nwords and the stage situations. His harmonies are rich and flowing, and\r\nimpart to his work a decided air of refined elegance. His\r\ninstrumentation emphasizes convincingly his thorough mastery over the\r\nresources of the modern orchestra and a sensitive appreciation of the\r\ncharacteristic tone-color of the different instruments. His scores are\r\nnever overloaded, and as the rule the right touch is always put by him\r\nin the right place. The voice is never overwhelmed by the orchestra.\r\nWith all these merits he is rarely if ever emphatic, and strength and\r\nintensity of passion are not among his musical gifts. Love, melancholy,\r\ngaiety and poetic tenderness are the sentiments in which he excels.\r\nFire, and a vigorous sweep of emotional feeling are not within his power\r\nto depict. The changes in the style of his scores are the changes that\r\nthe varying musical tastes of the times brought about. He never formed\r\nthese tastes, but he invariably followed them. His earlier operas are in\r\nthe vein of Auber or of Rossini, sometimes of both in combination. When\r\nthe fashion of the day called for more dramatic expression he followed\r\nin the footsteps of Halévy. Later, when brilliancy, tunefulness and\r\ngraceful commonplace were the vogue, he had no scruple against modelling\r\nhimself on Clapisson. It was not until Gounod had risen into fame and\r\n“Faust” became the rage, filling the music-loving world with delight,\r\nthat Thomas found it possible to write “Mignon” and “Hamlet,” in both\r\nwhich operas the influence of the younger composer is shown on almost\r\nevery page. Thomas has not the gift of originality, but he has the gift\r\nof receptivity and the faculty of assimilation largely developed. Twice\r\nhe went into seclusion, and each time when he reappeared it was with a\r\nstyle in harmony with that of the favorite opera composers of the hour.\r\nThere is nothing culpable in this, for it proves conclusively, that\r\nThomas was always an untiring student. It is undeniable, that on every\r\noccasion his style underwent a radical change, it showed an advance in\r\nthe broader and more impressive essentials of his art, and added to the\r\nfame of the composer. The works in which he will live are those which\r\nbelong to his last period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AMBROISE THOMAS.\r\n\r\n  Reproduction of a lithograph portrait published by Becquet of Paris.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNot so with his greater confrère Halévy, whose first grand successes,\r\n“La Juive” and “L’Eclair,” were his only masterpieces. Thomas has not\r\nreached the height to which Halévy soared in either of these operas.\r\n“Mignon” and “Hamlet” are, however, works of no common order. The former\r\nhas won a place in the repertory of every opera house in Europe. There\r\nis much of genuine poetic feeling in the music, and the score, as a\r\nwhole, is distinguished by grace, melodiousness, delicacy of taste, and\r\nthat effect of spontaneity that is understood as inspiration. Fine\r\ndiscrimination has been shown in giving each character its appropriate\r\nmusical expression, and the skill with which the people of the story are\r\ncontrasted cannot be too warmly praised. The “Connais-tu le pays,” the\r\n“swallow” duet, the prayer of Mignon, the romance of Wilhelm, the\r\npolonaise of Felina, have become justly celebrated. The orchestration is\r\nexquisite in its delicate finish and its ingeniously varied but always\r\nartistic color. That it has achieved a permanent place on the opera\r\nstage is beyond question. “Hamlet” is more ambitious, and though not\r\nwithout a certain nobility of style, is little else than a more\r\nelaborate “Mignon.” In it the composer says nothing that he has not\r\nalready said in the last-named work, the only change being a somewhat\r\nmore earnest method of expression. In this opera it was claimed that\r\nThomas “has indicated to young composers the line at which the new\r\nschool should stop, under penalty of exceeding the bounds of lyric art”;\r\nbut Thomas, though undoubtedly a musician of talent, knowledge and\r\nexperience, has never shown such originality as to entitle him to be\r\nconsidered a reformer, and as yet there has not been, even in his own\r\ncountry, any propaganda to spread a knowledge of him through the world.\r\n“Hamlet” may be considered the extreme point that French grand opera had\r\nreached in the direction of the Wagnerian music-drama up to the time\r\nthat it appeared. The Gounod influence is still clearly apparent in it,\r\nbut the Wagner influence also makes itself felt in the effort to break\r\naway from conventional models and to substitute expressive declamation\r\nfor more rhythmical melody. The mad song of Ophelia is, perhaps, the\r\nmost effective number in the opera. “Françoise de Rimini” went a step\r\nfurther than did “Hamlet” toward a predetermined departure from the old\r\nschool of operatic music to the new. The composer authorized the\r\nstatement that the prologue to the work would be a profession of musical\r\nfaith, which he had long contemplated and in which he would mark\r\ndefinitely how closely symphonic music can be allied with the lyric\r\ndrama; after which the curtain was to rise on music essentially\r\n“theatrical,” or, if a better word should be demanded, “human.” The\r\nprologue is certainly as strong and masterly, but it has in it nothing\r\nof a symphonic quality, and, as a profession of faith, proved to be of\r\nno permanent value save as an evidence of the highest point which the\r\ncomposer’s musical development had reached. This portion of the opera\r\nand the fourth act are by far the finest achievements of Thomas. The\r\norchestra through the whole opera is treated with consummate power,\r\nnotably in the beautiful effects obtained by unaccustomed groupings of\r\nthe different instruments. In the ingenious blendings of tone-color that\r\nare produced by combining widely varying timbres with a skill as\r\nprofound as felicitous; the richness, ripeness, and perfection of the\r\nscoring generally; as well as the masterly discretion observed in\r\nmaintaining a judicious balance between the orchestra and the singers,\r\nthe score may be justly given a place among the most masterly that\r\nmodern musical art has produced. For the rest, despite some splendid\r\ndramatic moments in the work and the faultless finish of its workmanship\r\nas a whole, it is to be doubted if it will live. But how few works do\r\nlive! Many glorious operas have been written since “Don Giovanni” and\r\n“Fidelio” saw the light, and yet not one has appeared that has yet been\r\naccorded a place by their side. Hundreds of operas that met with a\r\nbrilliant and deserved success in their day, have fallen gradually into\r\nthe background; operas by Spontini, who, in “La Vestale,” just escaped\r\nproducing an immortal masterpiece; by Cherubini, whose “Les Deux\r\nJournées” came nearer winning the third place than any opera since; by\r\nRossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi, Meyerbeer, whose “Les Huguenots” is\r\nhis only work that bids fair to survive; by Weber, whose “Der\r\nFreischütz” alone promises to last. The supreme operas of the world\r\nmight be named on the fingers of one hand. Mention of Wagner has been\r\navoided because he is yet to experience the test of time,—that\r\nincorruptible and most pitiless of critics. It is the fate of some\r\nadmirable and justly honored composers to learn their ultimate\r\nreputation with posterity during their lifetime. Among these, we think,\r\nis Ambroise Thomas, and that reputation will include respectful\r\nconsideration for an eminent and able musician, who constantly grew in\r\nhis art; while it will accord him a prominent place in the ranks of\r\nwholly estimable opera composers of the second order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B.

Woolf]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GEORGES BIZET\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a photograph from life, by Carjat & Cie., Paris._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                     ALEXANDRE CÉSAR LÉOPOLD BIZET.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexandre César Léopold Bizet was born in Paris, Oct. 25th, 1838. His\r\ngodfather called him “Georges,” and as “Georges,” Bizet is known to the\r\nworld at large.\r\n\r\nThe father of Bizet was an artisan, who, at the age of twenty-five,\r\nstudied music, and became a teacher of singing. He outlived his son. The\r\nmother was a sister of the wife of Delsarte. She was a pianist of\r\nability, a “first prize” of the Conservatory. From her Bizet learned the\r\nalphabet and musical notation. From his father he learned the use of the\r\npianoforte, and the elements of harmony.\r\n\r\nThe boy did not wish to be a musician; he hankered after the literary\r\nlife. “When I was a child,” Bizet told Gallet, “they hid my books to\r\nkeep me from abandoning music for literature.”\r\n\r\nAlthough he was not of the required age, Bizet passed brilliantly, in\r\nhis tenth year, the entrance-examination of the Conservatory, where he\r\nstudied the pianoforte under Marmontel, the organ under Benoist,\r\ncounterpoint and fugue under Zimmermann; and after the death of the\r\nlatter, he studied composition under Halévy. He won a prize before he\r\nwas eleven years old, the first of many prizes:—\r\n\r\nFirst solfeggio prize (1849); second pianoforte prize (1851), and the\r\nfirst pianoforte prize (1852); first “accessit d’orgue” (1853), second\r\nprize (1854), first prize (1855); second prize in fugue (1854), first\r\nprize (1855); second “grand prix de Rome” of the Institute (1856), and\r\nfirst “grand prix” (1857).\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Offenbach, manager of the Bouffes-Parisiens, proposed a\r\ncompetition in operetta. The libretto was “Doctor Miracle.”\r\nSeventy-eight composers appeared; six were found worthy, and the prizes\r\nwas awarded _ex aequo_, to Bizet and Lecocq. The music of the latter was\r\nfirst heard April 8th, 1857; the music of Bizet was heard April 9th. The\r\npublic was impartially cold.\r\n\r\nToward the end of 1857 Bizet started on his journey to Rome. He\r\njourneyed leisurely, and entered the city Jan. 28, 1858. It was in 1859\r\nthat he sent, according to rule, a composition to the “Académie des\r\nBeaux-Arts”; it was not a mass however; it was an operetta in Italian:\r\n“Don Procopio,” in two acts. The reviewer, Ambroise Thomas, praised the\r\nease, the brilliancy, “the fresh and bold style” of the composer, and he\r\ndeplored the fact that Bizet had not given his attention to a work of\r\nreligious character. The score of this operetta is lost. In 1859 Bizet\r\ntraveled in Italy and obtained permission to remain in Rome during the\r\none year, that, according to tradition, should be spent in Germany. He\r\nsent to the Académie “Vasco de Gama,” a descriptive orchestral\r\ncomposition with choruses; three numbers of an orchestral suite; and, if\r\nPougin is correct, an operetta in one act, “La Guzla de l’Emir”; but\r\nPigot claims that this latter work was not begun until after the return\r\nto Paris.\r\n\r\nHe returned and found his mother on her deathbed. He was without means,\r\nwithout employment; and he was crushed by the death of the one for whom\r\nhe was eager to work day and night. He once wrote to her from Rome,\r\n“100,000 francs, the sum is nothing! Two successes at the Opéra Comique!\r\nI wish to love you always with all my soul, and to be always as to-day\r\nthe most loving of sons.”\r\n\r\nHe was a “prix de Rome,”—too often an honor that brings with it no\r\nsubstantial reward. He was a “prix de Rome,” as was the unfortunate\r\ndescribed by Legouvé:\r\n\r\n                   “Listen to the wretched plight\r\n                   Of a melancholy man,\r\n                   A young man of sixty years,\r\n                   Whom they call ‘un prix de Rome.’”\r\n\r\nBurning with desire to write for the operatic stage, he gave music\r\nlessons. Dreaming of dramatic situations and grand finales, he made\r\npianoforte arrangements of airs from operas written by others.\r\n\r\nThe Count Walewski granted Carvalho, the manager of the Théâtre-Lyrique,\r\na subsidy of 100,000 francs, on the condition that an important work by\r\na “prix de Rome” should be produced each year. Bizet was the first to\r\nprofit thereby. He wrote the music for “The Pearl Fishers.” The text was\r\nby Carré and Cormon, and the opera was produced with gorgeous scenic\r\nsetting, Sept. 30, 1863. The opera was given eighteen times, and it was\r\nnot sung again in Paris until 1889, at the Gaité, and in Italian, with\r\nCalvé and Talazac, when it was only heard six times.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in Pigot’s “Bizet et son Œuvre” that Blau and Gallet wrote\r\na libretto, “Ivan, the Terrible,” which was set to music by Bizet in the\r\nstyle of Verdi. Gallet says that neither he nor Blau wrote a word of\r\nsuch a libretto.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 Bizet worked at the orchestral composition which three years\r\nlater was played at a Concert Pasdeloup and was then called “Souvenirs\r\nde Rome”; he temporarily abandoned it on the receipt of a libretto by\r\nSaint-Georges and Adenis, founded on Sir Walter Scott’s “The Fair Maid\r\nof Perth.” While he composed the music of this opera, he supported\r\nhimself by giving lessons, correcting proofs, arranging dance music for\r\norchestra, and writing songs. He often worked fifteen or sixteen hours a\r\nday. His letters of this year end with one and the same cry: “I must\r\nmake my living.” This pursuit of a living brought early death.\r\n\r\nThe score of “The Fair Maid of Perth” was finished in six months, but\r\nthe opera was not produced at the Théâtre-Lyrique until the 26th of\r\nDecember, 1867. There were twenty-one representations. In 1890 there\r\nwere eleven representations at the Eden Theatre (Théâtre-Lyrique).\r\n\r\nIt was in 1867 that Bizet wrote the first act of “Malbrough,” an\r\nopérette bouffe, which was given at the Athénée. In 1868 or 1869 he\r\nwrote the music of an opérette-vaudeville, “Sol-si-ré-pif-pan,” for the\r\nMenus-Plaisirs, and he did not sign the score.\r\n\r\nIt was also in 1867 that he appeared as a writer on musical subjects.\r\nHis first and last article was published in the first number of the\r\nRevue Nationale, Aug. 3rd. His pseudonym was “Gaston de Betzi.”\r\n\r\nAnd then Bizet busied himself in the completion of “Noah,” a biblical\r\nopera left unfinished by Halévy; in arranging operas for pianoforte\r\nsolo; in original compositions for the pianoforte, as his “chromatic\r\nvariations.” He wrote music for the text of “The Cup of the King of\r\nThule”; he called it “wretched stuff” and destroyed it. His “Souvenir de\r\nRome, fantaisie symphonique” was played at a Concert Populaire in 1869.\r\nIn that same year, June 3rd, he was married to Geneviève Halévy, the\r\ndaughter of the composer. After the invasion of France, Bizet served in\r\nthe National Guard, and his letters during those bloody days reveal the\r\ndepth of his patriotism and his disgust at the incompetence and\r\ncorruption in high places.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 (May 22) a little work in one act was brought out at the Opéra\r\nComique. It was called “Djamileh”; the text was by Gallet, the music was\r\nby Bizet. It was given ten or eleven times; and Saint-Saëns, infuriated\r\nat the Parisian public, wrote biting verses:\r\n\r\n“The ruminating bourgeois, pot-bellied and ugly, sits in his narrow\r\nstall, regretting separation from his kind; he half-opens a glassy eye,\r\nmunches a bon-bon, then sleeps again, thinking that the orchestra is\r\na-tuning.”\r\n\r\nCarvalho, manager of the Vaudeville, dreamed of reviving the melodrama.\r\nHe first caught his playwright, Daudet; he secured Bizet as the\r\nmusician; the result was “L’Arlésienne,” which was first produced Oct.\r\n1, 1872. The music included twenty-four numbers, orchestral and choral.\r\nThe score was designed for the particular orchestra of the Vaudeville.\r\nBizet rearranged for full orchestra the numbers that make up the Suite\r\nNo. 1, and the Suite was first played at a Concert Populaire Nov. 10,\r\n1872. He also revised the other numbers, and the revision was used at\r\nthe revivals at the Odéon in 1885 and 1887. The Suite No. 2 was arranged\r\nby Ernest Guiraud.\r\n\r\nThe overture, “Patrie,” was first played at a Concert Populaire in\r\nFebruary, 1874. Bizet experimented with texts suggested for an opéra\r\ncomique; he finally chose “Carmen,” the text of which was drawn by\r\nMeilhac and Halévy from a tale by Merimée. The opera was produced at the\r\nOpéra Comique, March 3, 1875, with the following cast: Carmen,\r\nGalli-Marié; Micaëla, Marguerite Chapuis; Don Jose, Lhérie; Escamillo,\r\nBouhy. It was about this time that Bizet was decorated with the red\r\nribbon of the Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\n“Carmen” was no more successful than its predecessors. Bizet mourned its\r\nfailure. For some time he had fought bravely against melancholy. At the\r\nage of thirty-six, he exclaimed, “It is extraordinary that I should feel\r\nso old.” Attacks of angina had been periodical for some years. He would\r\njest at his suffering: “Fancy a double-pedal, A flat, E flat, which goes\r\nthrough your head from ear to ear.” He had abused his strength by\r\nover-work. Suddenly, at midnight, he died in Bougival, where he was\r\nresting. It was June 3rd, three months after the first performance of\r\n“Carmen.” The widow was left with a five-year-old son.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BIZET’S TOMB IN PÈRE LACHAISE. PARIS.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph made specially for this work.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBizet left few manuscripts. He burned many shortly before his death. The\r\nfragments of “Don Rodrigue” and “Clarisse Harlowe” were left in a\r\ncurious notation that is nearly hieroglyphical, not to be deciphered.\r\n\r\nWhen Louis Gallet first met Bizet, he saw a forest of blonde hair, thick\r\nand curly, which surrounded a round and almost child-like face. Bizet’s\r\nfigure was robust. In later years his features were firm, and his\r\nexpression was energetic, tempered by the trust, the frankness, and the\r\ngoodness that characterized his nature. He was very short-sighted, and\r\nhe wore eyeglasses constantly. His mouth lent itself as easily to\r\nexpression of mocking wit as to kindness. His love for his parents has\r\nbeen already mentioned; his devotion toward his wife was such that she\r\ntold Gounod there was not one minute of the six years of marriage which\r\nshe would not gladly live over. He was a welcome companion, fond of jest\r\nand paradox, frank and loyal. At the house of Saint-Saëns he played\r\ngladly the part of Helen in Offenbach’s operetta. He was ever firm, even\r\nextravagant in friendship, as when at Baden-Baden in ‘62 he challenged a\r\nman who spoke lightly of Gounod’s “Queen of Sheba.” When the talk was\r\nconcerning musicians whom he loved, Bach, Mozart, Rossini, Verdi,\r\nGounod, his voice would lose its peculiar sibilance, and his hot\r\neloquence showed honesty as well as nimble wit and power of expression.\r\nIn all of the recollections of troops of friends, in his letters to\r\nacquaintances and friends there is not a suggestion of mean action,\r\nscheming purpose, low or narrow thought.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fourteen Bizet was a master of the pianoforte; his\r\ntechnique was above reproach; he was particularly skilful in mixing his\r\ncolors: an exquisitely defined melody had its proper and characteristic\r\nbackground. Halévy and Liszt are of the many witnesses to his\r\nextraordinary talent for reading from score at sight. Reyer speaks of\r\nhis remarkable memory. And yet Bizet never appeared in public as a\r\npianist; although in certain salons of Paris his abilities excited\r\nlively admiration.\r\n\r\nSo too his gifts as a composer for orchestra were more than ordinary;\r\nbut whenever he had an opportunity to write for the stage, he abandoned\r\nany instrumental work that had interested him.\r\n\r\nFor Bizet obeyed the instincts of the French musician and looked to the\r\nstage for enduring fame.\r\n\r\nThere is no need of close examination of “The Pearl Fishers,” and “The\r\nFair Maid of Perth.” We know the later works of Bizet, and therefore we\r\nfind hints of genius in the early operas. With the exception of the duet\r\nof Nadir and Zurga and of a few pages saturated with local color, there\r\nis little in “The Pearl Fishers” to herald the arrival of a master of\r\nthe stage. There are delightful examples of instrumentation in “The Fair\r\nMaid of Perth”: the opera as a whole is conventional, and the solo\r\npassages and the ensemble are often reminiscent: there is continual\r\nhomage to famous men: Gounod, Halévy, Verdi, Thomas, _et al._ Bizet had\r\nnot yet found the use of his own voice.\r\n\r\nNor would “Djamileh,” the satisfaction of the longing of Camille du\r\nLocle for ideal musical revery, the sounding of the revolt against the\r\nschool of Scribe, carry the name of Bizet to after years. Its perfume is\r\nsubtle and penetrating; its colors delight trained eyes. It is a _tour\r\nde force_. It has the affected frankness of a pastel in prose. The\r\nhearer must be mastered by the spirit of the Orient to thoroughly enjoy.\r\nThe three comedians should be seen as in an opium dream.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Bizet must rest eventually on two works: “L’Arlésienne” and\r\n“Carmen.”\r\n\r\nI believe “L’Arlésienne” is the more artistic, the greater work. In\r\n“Carmen” is the greater promise of what Bizet might have done. The music\r\nof “L’Arlésienne,” is inseparably associated with success or failure of\r\nthe play itself and the abilities of play-actors. If the concert-suite\r\nis played, it pleases; but apart from the representation of the dramatic\r\nscenes, the music loses its true significance. The saxophone solo in the\r\nPrelude, with its marvellous accompaniment, gratifies the ear in the\r\nconcert-room; but its haunting and melancholy beauty is intensified\r\ntenfold when it is associated with the apparition of “The Innocent.” It\r\nis impossible to over-rate the beauty, the passion, the dramatic fitness\r\nof the music that accompanies the various scenes in the simple and\r\nterrible drama of Daudet. The dialogue between _Mère Renaud_ and\r\n_Balthazar_ when they meet after fifty years is touching; but the\r\n_adagietto_, that softly tells of humble heroism, love preserved without\r\nshame, the kiss given at last and without passion, longings and regrets\r\nendured in silence, rises to a height of pathos that is beyond the reach\r\nof words or pantomime. In connection with the scene and the dialogue the\r\n_adagietto_ is irresistible in its effect; in the concert room, it is\r\nsimply a beautiful piece for muted strings. This play of Daudet is so\r\nsimple, so devoid of trickery that its popular and universal success is\r\nextremely doubtful. The average spectator would fain see the unworthy\r\n_Woman of Arles_ for whom _Fréderi_ burns in agony; the shepherd\r\n_Balthazer_ seems to him a good, tiresome old man with a beard; _The\r\nInnocent_, unless the part is played with rare finesse, becomes almost\r\nludicrous. Not until there is a return to the appreciation of simplicity\r\nwill this music of Bizet be known as the supreme example of music in the\r\ndomain of melodrama.\r\n\r\nMeilhac and Halévy in the libretto of “Carmen,” feel constantly the\r\npulse of the audience.\r\n\r\nThe opera is not a sustained masterpiece. The want of action in the\r\nthird act is not atoned for by a display of musical inspiration. With\r\nthe exception of the trio of card-players, the music of this act is far\r\nbelow that of the other three. But, with the omission of this act, how\r\nfrank, how intense, how characteristic, is the music that tells of a\r\ntragedy of universal and eternal interest.\r\n\r\nFor _Carmen_ lived years before she was known by Merimée. She dies many\r\ndeaths, and many are her resurrections. When the world was young, they\r\nsay her name was Lilith, and the serpent for her sake hated Adam. She\r\nperished that wild night when the heavens rained fire upon the Cities of\r\nthe Plain. Samson knew her when she dwelt in the valley of Sorek. The\r\nmound builders saw her and fell at her feet. She disquieted the\r\nblameless men of Ethiopia. Years after she was the friend of Theodora.\r\nIn the fifteenth century she was noticed in Sabbatic revels led by the\r\nfour-horned goat. She was in Paris at the end of the last century, and\r\nshe wore powder and patches at the dinners given by the Marquis de Sade.\r\nIn Spain she rolled cigarettes and wrecked the life of _Don José_.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic genius of Bizet is seen fully in his treatment of this\r\ncharacter. She sings no idle words. Each tone stabs. There are here no\r\nagreeable or sensuous love passages; as Bellaigue remarks, there is not\r\na touch of voluptuousness in the opera. The soldier is under the spell\r\nof a vain, coarse, reckless gipsy of maddening personality. He knows the\r\nfolly, the madness of his passion; he sees “as from a tower the end of\r\nall.” These characters are sharply drawn and forcibly painted. There is\r\nfree use of the palette knife; there is fine and ingenious detail. The\r\nsingers sing because it is the natural expression of their emotions;\r\nthey do not sing to amuse the audience or accommodate the stage\r\ncarpenter. The orchestra with wealth of rhythm and color italicizes the\r\nsong; prepares the action; accompanies it; or moralizes. Apart from the\r\ntechnical skill shown in the instrumentation, the great ability of Bizet\r\nis seen in his combining the French traditions of the past and the\r\nGerman spirit of the present without incongruity. Here is a departure\r\nfrom old models, and yet a confirmation. The quintet is sung because\r\nthereby the feeling of the scene is best expressed; five people are not\r\nintroduced because the quintet is an agreeable combination of voices.\r\nThe unmeaning vocal ornaments found in the earlier operas of Bizet have\r\ndisappeared. He uses his own manly, intense speech. He expresses his own\r\nthoughts in his own way. He does not care whether his work is opéra\r\ncomique or grand opera, or melodrama. His sole object is to tell his\r\nstory as directly and as forcibly as possible.\r\n\r\nIn a world of art that is too often ruled by insincerity, a lusty,\r\nwell-trained voice aroused the attention. Suddenly the voice was hushed.\r\nOnly with the silence, came the hearty approval of the great audience.\r\nBizet met with no popular success during his lifetime. Now “Carmen”\r\nholds the stage; “L’Arlésienne” excites the admiration of all musicians;\r\nthe earlier operas have been revived and sung in foreign languages. In\r\nhis own country he was from the start known vulgarly as “one of the most\r\nferocious of the French Wagnerian school”: an absurd charge: for in no\r\none of his operas is there recognition of the peculiar theories of\r\nWagner. Bizet followed the traditional formulas: he used the air, the\r\nconcerted pieces, the formal divisions and subdivisions. The orchestra\r\nassists the singer; it does not usurp his place. Without doubt he\r\nlearned from Wagner in the matter of orchestral expression, as Wagner\r\nlearned from Weber and Meyerbeer; as one sensible man does from his\r\npredecessors. There was nothing new in Bizet’s use of the typical\r\nmotive; it was similarly employed by Grétry, Auber, Halévy.\r\n\r\nMelody, expressive harmony, ingenious counterpoint, an unerring sense of\r\nthe value of a peculiar tone of an instrument or the advantage of a\r\ncombination of instruments,—these were used by the Bizet of later years\r\nsimply to express truth. This was the purpose of his life; this was the\r\nmotto of his existence. No one could be more refined than he in musical\r\nexpression; no one could be more seemingly brutal. The glowing words\r\nthat he wrote concerning Verdi in the Revue Nationale show his one\r\nprevailing thought: “Let us then be frank and true; let us not demand of\r\na great artist qualities which he lacks, and let us profit from the\r\nqualities which he possesses. When a passionate, violent, even brutal\r\ntemperament; when a Verdi presents us with a strong and living work full\r\nof gold and mud, of gall and blood, let us not go to him and say coldly,\r\n‘But, my dear Sir, this is wanting in taste, it is not _distingué_.’\r\n_Distingué!_ Are Michael-Angelo, Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Beethoven,\r\nCervantes, and Rabelais _distingués_?”\r\n\r\nIt is presumptuous, it is impossible to anticipate the verdict of Time\r\nthe Avenger. It is not improbable, however, that the future historian of\r\nthe opera will class Bizet with Wagner and Verdi as the men of mighty\r\ninfluence over the opera of the last years of this century. “Carmen”\r\nwas, perhaps, a promise, a starting point, rather than a fulfillment.\r\nBut if the young and fiery composers of Italy of to-day turn reverently\r\ntoward Verdi and Wagner, they also read lovingly the score of “Carmen.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Philip Hale]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Music]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CAMILLE SAINT-SAËNS\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a photograph from life, by Eug. Pirout, Paris._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                          CAMILLE SAINT-SAËNS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eminent composer, Camille Saint-Saëns, was born in Paris, October 9,\r\n1835. While yet an infant he manifested an innate gift for music. We are\r\ninformed by the most reliable of his biographers, his grand-aunt, that,\r\nobserving the deep attention with which the child listened to music, she\r\ngave him his first lessons on the piano when he was scarcely three years\r\nold. It would not be easy to find a record of earlier precocity. His\r\nmother relates, when her son began to play the first exercise, C, D, E,\r\nF, G, she discovered him playing it with only the right hand, using the\r\nother hand to press the weak little fingers down, in order to sound each\r\nnote distinctly. It was ingenious, almost virtuosity! That a child like\r\nSaint-Saëns should make rapid progress was inevitable. When his fingers\r\nwere sufficiently strong to strike the keys of the pianoforte without\r\ngreat effort, his grand-aunt, believing that she had reached the end of\r\nher task with him, placed him in charge of a professional teacher of the\r\npianoforte. It was not long before this teacher was replaced in turn, by\r\na master worthy of such a pupil, and wholly capable of guiding his\r\nstudies. This master was Stamaty, and the choice was admirable. In\r\naddition to Stamaty, who was only a teacher of the pianoforte, M.\r\nMaledan, an able instructor in harmony and theory and a man of decided\r\ntalent, was engaged to guide the more serious musical studies of young\r\nSaint-Saëns.\r\n\r\nThe boy was ten years old when his mother resolved that he should make\r\nthe acquaintance of some of the notabilities of the musical world before\r\nmaking his first appearance in public. To this end she gave a private\r\nsoirée at her house, the result of which was echoed through the press of\r\nParis. The lad performed, with Stamaty, one of Mozart’s Sonatas for four\r\nhands with surprising ease and in remarkable sympathy with the\r\ncomposer’s style. Then, with a quartet accompaniment, he performed some\r\nof the works of the great masters, including fugues by Bach, a concerto\r\nby Hummel, and Beethoven’s concerto in C minor.\r\n\r\nA few months later, he made his début before the public in a concert\r\ngiven in the Pleyel Salon, so much favored of artists, and where Chopin\r\nand Rubinstein, not to name other great pianist-composers, also made\r\ntheir first bow before a Parisian audience. Little Camille, as he was\r\nthen styled, achieved a flattering success. The most eminent critics\r\nsang his praises and predicted a great future for him. Never did they\r\nprophesy with more true foresight than they did on that occasion.\r\n_L’Illustration_ published his portrait, and there were some who went so\r\nfar as to draw a comparison between him and the incomparable Mozart!\r\n\r\nThis brilliant début in nowise spoiled the young pianist; on the\r\ncontrary, its effect only increased his zeal for study. He attended the\r\ncourse of lessons in composition under Halévy at the Conservatoire as an\r\n_élève auditeur_, literally, a listening pupil, for one year. He then\r\nobtained admission to the organ class where he won the first prize.\r\nEncouraged by his success he next appeared as a competitor at the\r\nInstitut (Prix de Rome), but failed. He never again crossed the\r\nthreshold of the Institut de France until long afterward, when he was\r\nreceived with honor and glory as a member of the “Section Musicale.”\r\nWhen he competed for the Prix de Rome, he was only seventeen years of\r\nage, but he had already attained celebrity as a pianist and an organist,\r\nand had also distinguished himself as the composer of several important\r\nscores. One of these was an ode to St. Cecilia, for chorus, solo, and\r\ngrand orchestra, which was performed by the Société Sainte Cécile, of\r\nwhich Seghers was the leader. The newspapers were as severe upon\r\nSaint-Saëns as a composer, as they had been satisfied with his début as\r\na pianist. “In the absence of inspiration of the first order, or of\r\nbrilliant genius,” writes the critic of the Gazette Musicale, “it could\r\nbe wished that the composer showed a little more _fougue_ and dash, were\r\nit only in a few paltry flights which reveal a young artist’s desire to\r\ncreate for himself an individual style.”\r\n\r\nWith Saint-Saëns inspiration came later, and it was pure inspiration,\r\nwithout fault, and was not wanting in originality.\r\n\r\nThe young composer soon avenged himself for these harsh criticisms, by\r\ncomposing his first symphony, in E flat, which was also executed by the\r\nSociété Sainte Cécile. The great artist of the future had not then\r\nreached his sixteenth year. The work was well calculated to encourage\r\nthe highest hopes for the future of the symphonist, and these hopes were\r\nabundantly realized by his last and admirable symphony in C minor, a\r\ncomposition which indeed may be considered a genuine masterpiece. The\r\nfirst symphony by the lad of sixteen met with a full measure of\r\napplause; it has been published and is still frequently played with\r\nsuccess. It appears in the catalogue of his complete works as the\r\nmusical leaflet No. 2. The second symphony, in F major, was performed\r\nfor the first time in 1856 by the Philharmonic Society of Bordeaux, and\r\nalso met with a warm welcome. A third symphony in D does not appear in\r\nthe catalogue, which also does not mention the second symphony, the only\r\nsymphonies named being those in E flat, in A minor (Leaflet 56) and in C\r\nminor (Leaflet 78). It would seem, therefore, either that two of the\r\nfive symphonies written by Saint-Saëns have not been published, or that\r\nthis _complete_ catalogue, printed by his publishers, Durand et\r\nSchoenewerk, of Paris, is _incomplete_.\r\n\r\nI have purposely omitted to mention four concertos for piano and\r\norchestra, because these productions, which are of a high order, have\r\nbrought to mind an incident which is worthy a special place in this\r\nbiography.\r\n\r\nThese four fine works were brilliantly performed on the same evening in\r\nthe Salle Pleyel by Mme. Marie Jaëll, the pianist so famous for her\r\nextraordinary, not to say marvellous, powers of execution. This was,\r\nindeed, a feat on the part of the virtuoso as well as an interesting\r\nexhibition of artistic talent, and its success was complete. The\r\nperformances began at nine o’clock in the evening and ended at half-past\r\neleven. Throughout this long and difficult test there was not the\r\nslightest momentary defect, either in the playing of the orchestra or in\r\nthat of the experienced and skilful pianist. For the success of so\r\ndifficult a task the most subtle artistic feeling and exceptional\r\nmuscular force were necessary. Mme. Jaëll possessed these qualities in\r\nsuch measure that the soirée devoted to the four concertos of\r\nSaint-Saëns will never fade from the memory of those who were present.\r\nBesides these concertos we should mention a concerto-fantaisie for piano\r\nand orchestra written in 1891 for Mme. Roger-Niclos, which she played\r\nwith great success at the Colonne concerts. This work has recently been\r\npublished.\r\n\r\nIn his work entitled “Virtuoses Contemporains,” our dear master and\r\nfriend, Marmontel, has felicitously described the style of piano playing\r\ncharacteristic of Saint-Saëns. “Saint-Saëns is as accomplished a pianist\r\nas he is an organist. He attacks the piece in hand with great energy,\r\nand keeps perfect time. His fiery and brilliant execution is flawless\r\neven in the most rapid passages. His powerful but admirably modulated\r\nplaying is full of majesty and breadth; and the only fault that can be\r\nfound with his masterly execution is, perhaps, the excess of rhythmical\r\nprecision. Ever master of himself, Saint-Saëns leaves nothing to chance\r\nand does not, perhaps, always yield sufficiently to the pathetic. On the\r\nother hand, the virtuoso always acquits himself with irreproachable\r\naccuracy.”\r\n\r\nFor many years Saint-Saëns has quitted Paris in the winter, to seek the\r\nwarm sunshine under the blue skies of those favored countries to which\r\nthe sun remains ever faithful. In order to travel and pass his time free\r\nfrom all annoyance, the composer has adopted the excellent custom of\r\ndeparting from Paris without any flourish of trumpets, without informing\r\nanyone where he intends to sojourn, and often without knowing, himself,\r\nexactly where he will pitch his tent. On leaving Paris on the 30th of\r\nNovember, 1889, he charged his worthy friend and colleague, Guiraud, of\r\nthe Institut, now no more, alas! in case the Académie de Musique should\r\nauthorize the rehearsals of his “Ascanio,” to begin during the\r\ncomposer’s absence. It was put in hand, and M. Guiraud, with score\r\nbefore him, followed the rehearsals with the utmost care and assiduity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CAMILLE SAINT-SAËNS.\r\n\r\n  Reproduction of a photograph from life by Raschkow, Jr.—Breslau.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the opera had made great progress, and everybody\r\nexpected, at any moment, the composer’s return. Not only did he refrain\r\nfrom reappearing in Paris to assist at the last rehearsals and to give\r\nhis final hints to the singers and the orchestra, but he did not even\r\nwrite to anyone. Nobody knew where he had concealed himself. This\r\nextraordinary and unheard-of act of a composer, who goes abroad to amuse\r\nhimself by chasing butterflies or collecting plants, while at home the\r\ntheatrical managers are making preparations for the first performance of\r\na work of such importance as a grand five-act opera, excited all Paris.\r\nIt even disturbed the Government, which caused inquiry to be made for\r\nthe musician by its diplomatic agents throughout the world. The search\r\nwas a vain one. It was generally thought that Saint-Saëns had died in\r\nsome part of Ceylon, where certain French travellers believed they had\r\nseen him as he was making his way to Japan. The first performance of\r\n“Ascanio” was given at a moment when it was in doubt whether Saint-Saëns\r\nwas dead or alive. Happily, he was still of this world and in very good\r\nhealth; but careless of his glory, was basking in the sunshine of the\r\nCanary Islands, busily engaged in finishing a volume of verse which\r\nappeared in Paris last year; for Saint-Saëns is a poet as well as a\r\nmusician. It was a relief to the public when an announcement was at last\r\nmade by Louis Gallet, the composer’s fellow-worker and friend, that the\r\nfugitive, at the very moment when “Ascanio” was under active rehearsal\r\nat the Opéra, was peacefully and contentedly breathing the warm and\r\nbalmy air of Palma. As soon as the newspapers betrayed his sojourn in\r\nthis verdant and flowery retreat, the authorities of the city and the\r\nprincipal inhabitants proposed to confer honors upon the master. But the\r\ncomposer had not gone all the way to Teneriffe for this purpose, and\r\nthanking the authorities for the homage they wished to pay him,\r\nimmediately disappeared again!\r\n\r\nSaint-Saëns is a husband and a father, but his married life has\r\nunfortunately not been a very happy one. His two children both died at\r\nan early age. One of them fell from the balcony of his father’s house,\r\nand was killed, while the other suddenly died a short time afterward.\r\nThus it sometimes happens that a man may have, like Saint-Saëns,\r\neverything that goes to make up the sum of human happiness—talent,\r\nsuccess, honor and fortune,—and yet yearn in vain for that complete\r\nfelicity which is denied him. Concealed like the statue of Isis, whose\r\nveil no mortal has ever been permitted to draw aside, is the condition\r\nof unalloyed happiness on this earthly sphere. We know that it exists;\r\nwe seek it; ofttimes we think it within our grasp, and yet it eludes us!\r\n\r\nWe cannot more fitly terminate this sketch of the great personality of\r\nSaint-Saëns than by adding that he is one of the most masterly readers\r\nof piano and organ music who has ever lived, and an improviser of the\r\nfirst rank.\r\n\r\nAs a child pianist and composer, Camille Saint-Saëns was what is called\r\nan infant prodigy. The child has come to man’s estate and is, at the\r\npresent moment, one of the most learned and able artists in every branch\r\nof his art, that can be found in the ranks of modern musicians. Since\r\nthe death of Beethoven, Schumann and Mendelssohn, he wields in Europe\r\nthe sceptre of symphony; he is renowned as a composer for the church and\r\nthe theatre, and as an organist; and the mastery he has shown in the\r\nconcerto, the oratorio and chamber music, of which he has produced a\r\nlarge number of works, is of world-wide fame.\r\n\r\nOf his purely instrumental music we may mention, in chronological order:\r\n“Tarentelle,” for flute and clarinet with orchestra; “Orient et\r\nOccident,” a military march; Ballade for piano, organ and violin;\r\nIntroduction and Rondo Capricioso, for violin and piano; “Le Rouet\r\nd’Omphale,” a symphonic poem; Concerto for violoncello in A minor;\r\nSonato for piano and violoncello; Heroic March for full orchestra;\r\nBallade for horn or violoncello and piano, in F; Ballade for flute or\r\nviolin and piano; Lullaby for piano and violin, in B flat; “Phaéton,” a\r\nsymphonic poem; “Danse Macabre,” for Orchestra, arranged for piano, for\r\none or two performers, and for one or two pianos; also for piano duet,\r\nwith violin or violoncello; for military band, etc; Quartet for piano,\r\nviolin, alto and violoncello; Allegro appassionata, for violoncello and\r\npiano; Ballade for violin and piano, in C; Suite for orchestra; prelude,\r\nsaraband, gavotte, ballade and finale; “La Jeunesse d’Hercule,”\r\nsymphonic poem; Ballade for violoncello and piano in D; Concerto for\r\nviolin in C major; “Suite Algérienne,” for orchestra; Concerto for\r\nviolin, in B minor; Concert piece for violin and piano; “Une Nuit à\r\nLisbonne,” barcarolle for orchestra; “La Jota Aragonaise,” for\r\norchestra; Septet for trumpet, two violins, alto, violoncello,\r\ncontra-bass and piano; Hymn to Victor Hugo, for orchestra; Sonata for\r\npiano and violin in D minor; “Wedding-Cake,” Caprice Valse for piano and\r\nstringed instruments; Caprice on Danish and Russian airs, for flute,\r\noboe, clarinet and piano; “Havanaise” for violin and piano; “La Fiancée\r\ndu Timbalier,” for orchestra; etc., etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph musical manuscript contributed by the composer\r\n    for use in this work\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe bear in mind several scores by Saint-Saëns which do not appear in the\r\ngeneral catalogue of his works. First of all, there is a very fine\r\ncomposition for a military band, which the illustrious musician was good\r\nenough to write at my request, in 1868, for the celebration of Hoche’s\r\ncentenary at Versailles. A short time ago I asked Saint-Saëns why he had\r\nnot published this beautiful work, written as a tribute to the memory of\r\nthe great French general, and which is so full of stirring patriotic\r\nsentiment. The composer replied that he did not know what had become of\r\nthis music since the day on which it was solemnly performed before the\r\nstatue of Hoche at Versailles. The full score and the orchestral parts\r\nhave remained undiscovered up to the present time. I may also mention,\r\nas among the compositions of Saint-Saëns, which are not included in the\r\ncatalogue of his works, an extremely original, bright and thoroughly\r\nartistic work written for several instruments and called “Le Carnaval\r\ndes Animaux.” Only one of the animals in this merry Carnival has been\r\nhonored by publication, viz.: “The Swan,” whose song is interpreted in\r\nthis zoölogical symphony by the violoncello.\r\n\r\nThe works by Saint-Saëns for piano solo, duet, and for two pianos are\r\nvery numerous. All of them are vigorously characteristic of the decided\r\nand learned style of the master, and are also marked by a certain\r\nindividuality peculiar to this famous pianist-composer.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the composer is one of the most renowned organists\r\nin Europe. As might be expected, he has written specially for this\r\ninstrument, which, figuratively speaking, is the embodiment of all other\r\ninstruments. We will only mention the Rhapsodies on the Breton\r\ncanticles; also the “Bénédiction Nuptiale” and “Elévation et Communion,”\r\nwhich are noble works for the King of Instruments.\r\n\r\nSaint-Saëns succeeded Lefébvre Wely as organist at the Madeleine. Among\r\nhis church compositions he has composed a Grand Mass for four voices,\r\nsoli and orchestra; “Tantum Ergo,” a Chorus; a “Christmas Oratorio” for\r\nchorus, soli and orchestra; Psalm XVIII.—“Cœli enarrant” for soli,\r\nchorus and orchestra; “Le Déluge,” biblical poem for soli, chorus and\r\norchestra; and a Requiem which, with the oratorio “Le Déluge,” we\r\ninclude among his best works. There is also a collection of twenty\r\nseparate motets for the Holy Communion, motets to the Virgin, and other\r\nmiscellaneous motets.\r\n\r\nWe may further mention among the characteristic compositions which are\r\nnot in the religious or the dramatic style:—Scene from Corneille’s “Les\r\nHoraces,” for soprano, baritone and orchestra; six Persian melodies,\r\nvocal and instrumental (piano); “Les Soldats de Gédéon,” double chorus\r\nwithout accompaniment; “Chanson du Grand-papa,” chorus for female\r\nvoices; “Chanson d’un Ancêtre,” chorus for male voices with baritone\r\nsolo; “La Lyre et la Harpe,” soli, chorus and orchestra; two choruses\r\nwith piano accompaniment: “Calme des Nuits” and “Les Fleurs et les\r\nArbres”; two choruses for male voices without accompaniment: “Les Marins\r\nde Kermor” and “Les Titans”; “Les Guerriers,” chorus for male voices;\r\nseveral other choruses, besides some fifty duets and melodies with piano\r\naccompaniment. We abridge the list in order to mention the composer’s\r\ndramatic works: “Le Timbre d’Argent”; “La Princesse Jaune,” comic opera\r\nin one act; “Proserpine,” lyric drama in four acts; “Etienne Marcel,”\r\nopera in four acts; “Samson et Dalila,” biblical opera in three acts;\r\n“Henry VIII.,” opera in four acts; and lastly, “Ascanio,” opera in five\r\nacts.\r\n\r\nIt has been said with truth that Saint-Saëns is of all composers the one\r\nwho differs most from himself, in his dramatic works. We mean by this\r\nthat he has emancipated himself from the hard and fast lines of any\r\nparticular school; that he has no system and is guided wholly by his own\r\ninspiration, tempered and strengthened by great musical learning. He\r\ncould, if he so desired, write according to the theories or in the\r\nmanner of this or of that composer, but he prefers to write as his\r\ngenius follows its own individual vein, agreeing, no doubt, with his\r\nfamous colleague and friend, Charles Gounod, that if there are many\r\nsystems of composition, there are, after all, only two kinds of music:\r\nthat which is good and that which is bad. His admiration for all the\r\ngreat masters is profound, but he strives to imitate none, this has\r\ncaused certain critics to subject him to the reproach of eclecticism. He\r\nhas expressed himself on this point with frank sincerity (for\r\nSaint-Saëns is a man as well as a musician) in a highly interesting\r\nvolume entitled “Harmonie et Mélodie.” After declaring that he had never\r\nbelonged to any religion in music, he adds: “I claim to preserve my\r\nliberty, to like what pleases me and to reject the rest; to believe good\r\nthat which is good, discordant that which is discordant, absurd that\r\nwhich is absurd. This is precisely what the more ardent disciples of\r\nWagner refuse to concede. They grasp you by the throat, and insist that\r\nyou must admire everything Wagnerian, no heed what it may be. With them\r\nthere is something beyond love of art: the spirit of sectarianism. I am\r\nafraid of sectarians, and so keep myself prudently aloof from them.”\r\n\r\nIt was of these Wagnerian critics, who carry their love for the composer\r\nof “music-dramas” to the point of fanatic intolerance, even of ferocity,\r\nthat Saint-Saëns was thinking when he wrote these lines, as well as\r\nothers that we shall quote presently; and these same critics accused our\r\ncomposer of the crime of refusing to enlist under the banner of the\r\nmaster of Bayreuth. They sought to crush Saint-Saëns in their criticisms\r\nof his last great opera, “Ascanio,” by saying, not only had he here\r\nperpetrated the heresy of adhering to that form of opera that prevailed\r\nbefore Wagner propounded his theories of the “lyric drama,” but that he\r\nhad also forgotten himself so far as to write airs in the Italian style!\r\nThese amiable censors showed themselves more royalist than the king\r\nhimself, for as a matter of fact Wagner by no means despised Italian\r\nairs; on the contrary, he liked them very much if we may believe what he\r\nhas said. The following words of the composer of “Lohengrin” are worth\r\nremembering: “After listening to an opera by Bellini, that has delighted\r\nus, we discover on reflection, that its charm is owing to the clear\r\nmelody, to the simple, lofty and beautiful song of the Italian composer.\r\nTo treasure in the memory these delightful melodies is certainly no\r\ngrave sin. Nor is it a heavier one to pray to heaven, before retiring to\r\nrest, that it may inspire German composers with the secret of these\r\nmelodies and a like manner of using them.”\r\n\r\nThe truth is that in music, as in all other arts, we do what we can\r\nrather than what we should most like to do, and he is wisest who is\r\nguided by his own genius. The genius of Camille Saint-Saëns is so rich\r\nin resources that he can safely trust himself and let the spirit work\r\nwithin him as it wills. There are composers who, forgetting that beauty\r\nis inseparable from high art, strive after eminence by seeking\r\noriginality at any cost, and who do not disdain to make that art,\r\nharmonious before and beyond all other arts, the art of torturing our\r\nears with music that is _per se_ inharmonious. Is not Saint-Saëns right\r\nwhen, in speaking of these psychological and hysterical composers, he\r\nsays with peculiar felicity: “It is certain that we cannot work too hard\r\nto instil in the public a taste for pleasures of an elevated order; but\r\nto offer it what is ingeniously described as ‘painful pleasure,’ to\r\noffer a feast consisting of ‘exquisite suffering’ and ‘poetic\r\nperversion,’ merely ends in mortification. When we wish to mortify our\r\nsouls we do not go to the theatre but to a convent.”\r\n\r\nWe may be asked for the opinion of the composer of “Faust,” “Roméo et\r\nJuliette” and “Mireille,” concerning the composer of “Samson et Dalila,”\r\n“Henry VIII.” and “Ascanio.” I am in a position to answer the question.\r\nGounod has spoken of Saint-Saëns in connection with his last opera as\r\nfollows: “That in the lyric drama, music should coalesce with the drama\r\nand blend in one harmonious whole is an excellent theory, but only on\r\ncondition that in this indissoluble union, music shall still be true and\r\nbeautiful music; otherwise the union is no more than a cruel bondage for\r\none of the arts so joined, and that art is Music. Throughout the works\r\nof Saint-Saëns we are in communion with an artist who never for an\r\ninstant forgets or sacrifices his art; everywhere and always is the\r\ngreat musician present, and everywhere, too, the drama appears before\r\nhim as a _law_, not as a _yoke_. Passions, characters, situations, are\r\nfelt by him with the same certainty of discernment, whether in song,\r\ndeclamation, recitative, or in the dramatic part which must be played by\r\nhis orchestra; and all this in an idiom and a form which are musically\r\nirreproachable, insomuch that he has created true and lasting ‘morceaux\r\nde musique’ even where the librettist did not provide the frame-work\r\nexpected of him.”\r\n\r\nWere we not limited as to space, it would be a pleasing task to present\r\nhere a technical and æsthetic analysis of the operas of the French\r\nmaster concerning whom we write thus briefly; but this would carry us\r\ntoo far. Suffice it, from what we have already written, for the reader\r\nto form a satisfactory judgment on the instrumental and vocal works of\r\nSaint-Saëns. In the “Timbre d’Argent,” which has something in common\r\nwith the fable of “Faust,” we are in the midst of a musical and\r\nchoreographic fantasy. This score is very attractive and well emphasizes\r\na very pretty performance.\r\n\r\n“La Princesse Jaune” transports us into the East, where reality seems as\r\na dream. It is a drawing-room comedy, the scene of which is laid in a\r\nJapanese village, where Dutch tulips grow as rank as does the grass in\r\nthe fields; where the sky is blue, where everything is full of color and\r\nappears smiling, joyous and lovable.\r\n\r\nIn “Etienne Marcel,” the illustrious Prévôt des Marchands, we have\r\nhistorical drama, in the civil war waged for the triumph of communal\r\nliberties. The rioters force a violent entrance into the Palais de la\r\nCité, and the voices of scoffers are heard alternating with the cries of\r\nraving fanatics. It is terrible, and quite characteristic of the\r\nParisian mind in the troublous times when the streets became one great\r\nbattle-field. Love, of course, finds its place in “Etienne Marcel,” a\r\nlove gentle and searching. Some of the contrasts are most happy, the\r\nchoruses are superb, the volume of sound is sublime.\r\n\r\n“Samson et Dalila,” as is sufficiently indicated by the title, is a\r\nbiblical opera, almost an oratorio, reminding us of the “Joseph” of\r\nMéhul. I was overflowing with enthusiasm on coming out from the\r\nrepresentation of “Samson et Dalila.” This score and the symphony in C\r\nminor are, I believe, the two finest jewels in the crown of this musical\r\nking. They are works full of the highest inspiration, of a most sublime\r\ncast, wonderfully elaborate in style, and masterpieces in the fullest\r\nsense of the word.\r\n\r\nThe gloomy subject of “Henry VIII.” opened up new fields to Saint-Saëns,\r\nand afforded him a local color that influenced his music. The moment the\r\nscore opens, we feel that we know exactly where we are and whither we\r\nare going. The principal personages in the drama have been each and all\r\ninstantaneously portrayed and their diverse characters are accurately\r\nrepresented. The king of England, the Pope’s nightmare and the terror of\r\nhis queenly wives and victims, is, from a musical point of view,\r\nespecially well portrayed in his wild orgies and brutal amours. Anne\r\nBoleyn fails to hide the pride that lies behind her love, although its\r\nexpression is not less charming on that account. Catherine of Arragon,\r\nthe noble and unfortunate forsaken one, is superb in her insulted\r\nmajesty, her pathetic and sweet melancholy. The choruses are treated in\r\na masterly manner, and there is one important “morceau d’ensemble” which\r\nis a signal triumph of expressive and dramatic counterpoint. The airs in\r\nthe ballet impress us as being thoroughly English. As to the orchestra,\r\nthe importance of which cannot be over-estimated, it plays in a measured\r\nand finished style and produces the effect of a powerful organ. Here we\r\nhave local color again, cleverly used.\r\n\r\n“Ascanio” is the last dramatic work of Saint-Saëns. The fanatical\r\npartisans of the Wagnerian theories, as we have already observed, were\r\nnot sparing of bitter criticism. Saint-Saëns must have found ample\r\nconsolation for this in the continuous applause showered upon him by the\r\npublic which always cordially welcomes whatever affords it pleasure.\r\n“Ascanio” is indeed equal in all respect to “Henry VIII.,” and worthy\r\nthe composer, which is saying not a little of a man who has given such\r\ntreasures to all lovers of music.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oscar Comettant]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JULES MASSENET\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a photograph from life by Nadar of Paris._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                     JULES EMILE FRÉDÉRIC MASSENET\r\n\r\n\r\nJules Emile Frédéric Massenet was born on the 12th of May, 1842, at\r\nMontaud, in the department of the Loire, and was the eleventh child of\r\nhis parents. His musical talent developed at an early age. When only\r\neleven years old he was sufficiently acquainted with the theoretical\r\nelements of the art to take his place in François Bazin’s harmony class\r\nin the Conservatoire. It is by no means uncommon for a professor to\r\nmistake the capacity of his pupils. Unfortunately Bazin failed to\r\nforesee the splendid future reserved for his young pupil Massenet: on\r\nthe contrary, he believed him to be destitute of all musical talent and\r\nrequested that he might be dismissed from his class. The poor little\r\nmusician felt so deeply humiliated by this insult that he was almost\r\ninclined to renounce music forever. It was five years before he\r\nreappeared at the Conservatoire, but luckily, at the end of that long\r\nterm, he returned to study under the learned Henri Reber in the harmony\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nOne day, shortly after Massenet joined this class, Reber addressed him\r\nthus in presence of his fellow-pupils: “Monsieur, I urge you, for your\r\nown welfare, to quit my class and go into a higher one, a class where\r\nfugue and composition are taught. You understand as much of harmony, so\r\ncalled, as I can teach you, and you will waste your time if you remain\r\nwith me. Follow my advice, for if I am a true prophet, you will make\r\nyour mark.”\r\n\r\nThus it was that, dismissed from Bazin’s harmony class as a dunce,\r\nMassenet was advised to leave Reber’s class because he learned too\r\nrapidly. The youngster followed the advice given by the composer of “Le\r\nPère Gaillard” and “La Nuit de Noël,” and studied fugue and composition\r\nwith Ambroise Thomas, the composer of “Mignon” and “Hamlet,” who had\r\nbeen appointed director of the school after the death of Auber.\r\n\r\nIn the composition class young Massenet so distinguished himself by his\r\nardor and application to study, that he won, and ever after retained,\r\nthe friendship of Ambroise Thomas. At each lesson he submitted to his\r\nmaster, in addition to fugues and exercises in counterpoint,\r\ninstrumental and vocal works of various kinds, each bearing witness to\r\nhis lively imagination and to his instinct to produce something new. Of\r\ncourse all these efforts of the future composer of “Manon” were not\r\nirreproachable, and sometimes his comrades rallied him on what they\r\ncalled his fits of musical intoxication. “Let him sow his wild oats,”\r\nsaid Ambroise Thomas, “and you will find that when he has sobered down\r\nand become more reflective he will achieve something. He is a genius.”\r\n\r\nThe time was close at hand when Massenet was to fulfil this flattering\r\nprophecy. In the very same year, 1863, he obtained the first prize in\r\ncounterpoint and fugue at the Conservatoire and the Grand Prize for\r\nmusical composition (Grand Prix de Rome) at the Institut de France. He\r\nwas then, we believe, already married, although physically he did not\r\nlook more than fifteen years of age.\r\n\r\nAs he had an annual allowance accorded him by the State, he set out for\r\nthe Eternal City and made a tour in Italy, proceeding thence to Germany\r\nto seek inspiration from the masters of symphony. The winner of the\r\nGrand Prix de Rome is expected during his sojourn abroad, to send at\r\nleast one work to the Institute as a proof that he has turned his time\r\nto good account and has made due progress. Whether or not young Massenet\r\nleft his light-heartedness behind him when he crossed the French\r\nfrontier we cannot say; but the composition he sent from Rome was a\r\nRequiem. Massenet wrote a large work for solo voices, chorus and\r\norchestra, entitled “Pompéia,” which in form as well as in\r\ninstrumentation showed the influence of Berlioz. This indicated an\r\ninquiring and meditative mind in the young composer, who was thus\r\nfeeling his way through the boldest and most modern school of music.\r\n\r\nMassenet sent a second envoy from Rome, which was his first orchestral\r\nsuite. With this suite is associated an event of great importance in the\r\nmusical career of the composer. Massenet tells the story himself.\r\n\r\nThe composer had just returned to France, after passing in Italy and\r\nGermany the regulation period accorded the laureates of the Institute.\r\nWhile walking in the street, he met Pasdeloup, the founder and director\r\nof the celebrated “Popular Concerts.” Pasdeloup was one of the best men\r\nin the world, but he had the habit of treating young composers in a\r\nbrusque and patronizing manner. He had only seen Massenet once, and that\r\nwas during the performance of the cantata for which he was awarded the\r\nGrand Prize. As has already been stated, Massenet always looked much\r\nyounger than he really was, and from his twentieth to his twenty-fourth\r\nyear he had the face and air of a boy of sixteen. Pasdeloup accosted him\r\nwith a frown, as though he had something disagreeable to tell him, and\r\nspeaking in an offensively familiar and condescending manner, said:—\r\n\r\n“Ah, so you have returned to France. What have you been doing during\r\nyour absence?”\r\n\r\n“I have been writing music, M. Pasdeloup.”\r\n\r\n“That is all very well; but it is not sufficient to write music; you\r\nmust write good music. Is your music really good?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, it is not for me to pass judgment upon it.”\r\n\r\n“You have written, I believe, an orchestral suite?”\r\n\r\n“Yes sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but everybody writes orchestral suites. Is yours a good one? Are\r\nyou satisfied with it yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Monsieur Pasdeloup, I feel obliged to admit that it pleases me\r\nwhen I play it on the piano, but I have not yet heard it performed by an\r\norchestra.”\r\n\r\n“Of course it pleases you. But how much music is there that pleases its\r\ncomposer, and yet is not worth a button. Can I see your manuscript?”\r\n\r\n“You do me too much honor, Monsieur Pasdeloup. I will send my score to\r\nyou this very evening.”\r\n\r\n“Good. I will tell you what I think of it and whether it pleases me as\r\nmuch as it pleases you. Let me say that I think very little of the music\r\nof young men who win the Prix de Rome. They only know how to imitate the\r\nfaults of the masters they study. However, we shall see.”\r\n\r\nAnd Pasdeloup quitted Massenet with an air of utter dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe young composer hastened home and told his family of the interview\r\nand of the faint hope he cherished that his suite might possibly be\r\nperformed at the famous Popular Concerts. He then rolled up his score,\r\ntook it to Pasdeloup’s residence, and left it with the concierge. Ten\r\ndays later Massenet received, by post, a gift which filled him with\r\nequal joy and surprise. It was a ticket admitting him to a rehearsal. He\r\nwas invited to the Cirque d’Hiver, where the Popular Concerts were\r\ngiven, to hear a rehearsal of his orchestral suite.\r\n\r\nNext day, full of excitement, he set out for the rehearsal. On arriving\r\nat the door, however, he had not sufficient courage to enter, so\r\novercome was he by his emotions. “Perhaps,” thought he, “the orchestral\r\neffect may not be what I intended,” and he felt that he had not strength\r\nto brave the severe criticisms of Pasdeloup and the jeers of the members\r\nof the orchestra.\r\n\r\nMassenet returned home without having dared to listen to the rehearsal\r\nof his work and wholly discontented with himself. He called himself a\r\ncoward and a pretender, and as he passed along the boulevard, his eye\r\nmechanically seeking the announcement of the performances at the\r\ntheatres and concerts, he was suddenly astounded to see his own name on\r\nthe programme of the Pasdeloup Concert to be given on the following\r\nSunday. They were really going to play his suite! He ran rather than\r\nwalked home to announce the glorious news.\r\n\r\n“They play—my suite—Sunday—Popular Concert!—Oh! how my heart beats!”\r\n\r\nAnd the great composer, as the memory of the beginning of his musical\r\ncareer came back to him, bowed his head on my breast and burst into\r\ntears. I wept with him.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said he, “I was happier then than I am to-day. Anticipation is\r\nbetter than the reality.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MASSENET IN HIS STUDY.\r\n\r\n  Reproduced from a photograph from life made by Dornac & Co., Paris,\r\n    1891.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe opera “Manon” has a curious history which Massenet related to me one\r\nday. Everybody knows in what singular circumstances the author of “Manon\r\nLescaut” (Abbé Prévost) took refuge at The Hague. It was in that city\r\nthat he wrote his “Mémoires d’un Homme de Qualité” to which “Manon\r\nLescaut” seems to belong as a species of postscript or sequel. In a like\r\nmanner, and in that Dutch town, Massenet, owing to certain\r\ncircumstances, chanced to write the score of “Manon” the substance of\r\nwhich is taken from the Abbé Prévost’s romance. Wishing to remain apart\r\nfrom the rest of the world, in order to be quite undisturbed, he took\r\nlodgings as a boarder under an assumed name at a house in The Hague. To\r\nprevent all suspicion as to identity, he did not send for a piano, for,\r\nunlike some composers, Massenet does not need a piano to enable him to\r\ncompose. He thinks out his music, which he hears inwardly, already\r\narranged for the orchestra. Absorbed in his work, the composer labored\r\nunceasingly. He never went forth to take necessary exercise until after\r\nnightfall, that he might run no risk of being recognized. After his\r\nwalk, which lasted about an hour, he returned home with coat collar\r\nturned up to conceal his face.\r\n\r\nHe was accustomed to write at a large table littered with music-paper,\r\neach sheet bearing thirty staves. When not actually engaged in composing\r\nhe amused himself by reading the Abbé Prévost’s romance, written by the\r\nFrench author in that same foreign town, possibly even in that same\r\nhouse, more than a century before. And Massenet’s artistic imagination\r\nsaw in this fact a happy prognostic. “Why,” thought he, “should not my\r\nscore of ‘Manon’ be as successful as was Prévost’s immortal novel?\r\nGrant, O, Sovereign God of Inspiration, that I may cause the sweet and\r\nloving Manon to sing, after a lapse of a hundred years, under the same\r\nsky, far away from Paris, and in the same happy strain as that in which\r\nthe most worldly of abbés made her speak!”\r\n\r\nThe existence of the mysterious foreigner who was always writing music\r\nbut who never played any instrument, greatly exercised Massenet’s\r\nlandlord. The inmates of the house were not less mystified than was he.\r\nThe gossips agreed that this French musician was a choir-master—and a\r\nvery original one. At last the composer was recognized, and the next day\r\nthe newspapers informed the public that Massenet had been for some time\r\nat The Hague. People flocked to see him, and his apartments were\r\nspeedily crowded with friends or with persons who came from mere\r\ncuriosity. Happily, however, the score of “Manon” was completed.\r\n\r\nMassenet is one of the most estimable of men, kind and sympathetic to a\r\nfault, and possessed of great delicacy and consideration for others. He\r\nwould enjoy the friendship of all men, were he less talented and\r\nconsequently less liable to inspire jealousy. Of medium stature, spare\r\nbut well made and of striking appearance, he has always looked younger\r\nthan he really was, a happy privilege among the many others enjoyed by\r\nthis favored son of genius, who is an honor and glory of the present\r\ngeneration of French composers. He is now a member of the Institute of\r\nFrance, a professor of composition at the National Conservatory of Paris\r\nand an Officer of the Legion of Honor.\r\n\r\nAs we close this biographical sketch, the distinguished composer has\r\njust given the first performance of his latest opera, “Werther,” at the\r\nGrand Theatre of Vienna, where it met with brilliant success. Massenet\r\nhas been kind enough to bestow on us a page of the work to place in this\r\nbiography, with a specimen of his handwriting, and we tender him our\r\nwarmest thanks. By the time these lines meet the eye of the reader,\r\n“Werther” will have been put upon the stage at the Opéra Comique, in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nMassenet’s debut in theatrical work dates from the third of April, 1866,\r\nwhen “La Grand’tante,” a pretty little piece full of melody and\r\nfreshness, was represented at the Opéra Comique. It was he who, on the\r\nEmperor’s fête, August 12 of the following year, wrote the official\r\ncantata performed at the Opéra.\r\n\r\nAfter this first attempt in theatrical music, and his cantata, Massenet\r\nproduced various concert works, among others, “Poèmes et Souvenirs” and\r\n“Poèmes d’Avril,” the words of which are by Armand Sylvestre; also a\r\n_bouffe_ scene entitled “L’Improvisateur.” His second Suite\r\nd’Orchestre,—a Suite Hongroise, was played at the Concerts Populaires.\r\nFor the Société Classique Armingaud he composed “Introductions et\r\nVariations,” a quartet for stringed and wind instruments. In 1872 he\r\nproduced his second dramatic work, “Don César de Bazan,” at the Opéra\r\nComique; but the public did not give it a very cordial reception. It had\r\nbeen written under unfavorable conditions, improvised, as it were, in\r\nthree weeks. The managers of the theatre proposed terms to the young\r\ncomposer which he was obliged to accept or decline without amendment.\r\nMassenet took his revenge for this treatment, however, in the very same\r\nyear, with the delightful scenic music for the drama, “Les Errynies,” by\r\nthe Comte de Lisle, which was represented at the Odéon. The next year,\r\n1873, the composer produced one of his most exquisite scores, which\r\nshows his warm poetic talent in the most characteristic manner. This was\r\n“Marie Madeleine,” a sacred drama in three acts, which has had a\r\nworld-wide success. So successful was it indeed that Massenet was\r\nencouraged to write “Eve,” a mystery in three acts. This latter, so\r\nintimately related in character to “Marie Madeleine,” has been given at\r\nthe concerts of sacred harmony established by Lamoureux. In this, too,\r\nthe composer’s personality is emphasized by exquisitely delicate and\r\npoetic touches. The same may be said of “La Vierge,” a sacred legend in\r\nfour parts, written for the Opéra concerts and played for the first time\r\nin 1880. The “Sleep of the Virgin” in this legend is one of those\r\ninspirations which prove beyond all doubt the measure of a composer’s\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nA year before the production of “La Vierge,” Massenet had given the\r\nFrench National Academy of Music his first great opera, “Le Roi de\r\nLahore,” in five acts, the success of which was not at first evident.\r\nThe public considered this beautiful music slightly cold, and\r\ninstrumental rather than vocal. They said the composer had shown himself\r\nwanting in melody, and that he had sacrificed too much to his love for\r\nscientific combinations, although wild applause greeted a certain number\r\nof happily-conceived songs, among others the aria so splendidly rendered\r\nby Lassalle and which has always been honored with an encore.\r\n\r\nIt is only when great works are reproduced after a certain interval of\r\ntime that we can determine whether they are really worthy a place in the\r\nmusical repertory. The reproduction at the Opéra of the “Roi de Lahore”\r\nwas a great success, and it has always been enthusiastically received in\r\nthe principal theatres of Europe and America.\r\n\r\nThe Théâtre de la Monnaie, at Brussels, enjoyed the privilege of giving,\r\nin 1881, the first performance of Massenet’s second grand opera,\r\n“Hérodiade” in three acts and five tableaux. This time success was\r\nbeyond all doubt, and from the first representation onward, the piece\r\nwas received with enthusiasm. Whatever M. Massenet may hereafter give to\r\nthe world, “Hérodiade” will undoubtedly remain one of the finest works\r\nthat have originated in the fertile brain of this distinguished\r\nmusician. Throughout the work the divine afflatus is maintained, and\r\nmelody fills the auditorium. The opera is full of passion and sentiment,\r\nat once human and religious, just as in “Marie Madeleine.” It might be\r\nsaid that “Hérodiade” is the same sacred drama brought upon the stage,\r\nwith this difference, that Madeleine becomes Salome, and Christ is\r\ntransformed into John.\r\n\r\nAfter “Hérodiade,” in Brussels, we had, in 1884, “Manon” at the Opéra\r\nComique in Paris. Were I asked to make a definite choice between\r\n“Hérodiade” and “Manon” I should hesitate; but I should choose “Manon.”\r\nFrom the first to the last note the work is delightful. It is not less\r\nbeautiful when softly sung at home to the accompaniment of the piano,\r\nthan in the theatre, where our delight never for an instant moderates.\r\n\r\nFollowing “Manon” in 1885, Massenet’s “Le Cid” in four acts, was\r\nperformed at the Grand Opéra in Paris, and although reproduced several\r\ntimes, this work still maintains its place in the repertory.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, the indefatigable composer returned to the Opéra Comique with\r\n“Esclarmonde,” which drew crowds to this theatre during several months.\r\n\r\nIn the chronological order of the musician’s dramatic works,\r\n“Esclarmonde” is followed by “Le Mage,” a grand opera in four acts and\r\nsix tableaux, the poem by M. Richepin, performed at the National Academy\r\nof Music in Paris. I have witnessed several renderings of this work, and\r\nhave read the piano score. The more I have studied the opera the more am\r\nI impressed by its wonderful beauty. The individuality of the work, its\r\npassion and grace and delicacy, its originality as to form and harmony,\r\nare so numerous that it is unnecessary to criticise it more\r\nparticularly.\r\n\r\nAll lovers of music know the extent of Massenet’s skill as a master of\r\nharmony. He is a master in the full meaning of the expression. It would\r\nbe impossible for a musician to carry to a higher degree than he has\r\ndone the complex art of orchestration or of counterpoint, so much\r\nhonored of late years, though so often abused; or to have more happy\r\nfacility as a harmonist. Were I to presume to criticise anything in the\r\nauthor of “Le Mage,” I should limit myself to mentioning his too clearly\r\napparent striving after _effect_ by means of fresh combinations of\r\ninstruments. Massenet has too great a wealth of truly musical ideas for\r\nhim to labor so hard for _material_ effects. The true effects in music\r\nare produced by the thought, by the idea, apart from the application of\r\nthe thought or idea to any special instrument. There is scarce any charm\r\nof emotion produced by music save through the musician’s imagination,\r\nthat is, by the invention which results from the inward and profound\r\nemotion felt by the composer. Were it only necessary to be learned in\r\nany given art, only necessary to possess the power of cleverly combining\r\nnotes and the tones of musical instruments, so as to produce fine\r\nmusical works, every artist now living would write masterpieces; for, in\r\ntruth, the study of technique has never been carried so far as it has\r\nbeen during the past twenty years. Technique is undoubtedly\r\nindispensable, but of itself it serves no purpose and is of no value,\r\nunless it be used as the exponent of the melodic conception which is the\r\nvery soul of music.\r\n\r\nM. Massenet has published seven suites for orchestra, which may be found\r\nin the repertory of every great musical society. To him we owe various\r\nscenes for chorus and orchestra: “Narcisse,” and “Biblis”; a symphonic\r\npoem entitled “Visions,” and a large number of fugitive melodies with\r\npianoforte accompaniment. He has also completed the score of a ballet,\r\n“Le Carillon,” as yet unpublished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oscar Comettant]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile of musical manuscript written by Massenet.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHARLES GOUNOD\r\n\r\n  _Reproduction of a photograph from life by Nadar, of Paris._\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOUNOD]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n                             CHARLES GOUNOD\r\n\r\n\r\nGounod, the greatest living musician of France is descended from a\r\nfamily of artists. His grandfather, a very distinguished enchaser, bore\r\nthe title of “sword cutler to the king,” and as such occupied an\r\napartment in the Louvre buildings, a favor which was granted to only\r\nartists of renown. His son, Jean François Gounod, who was born about\r\n1760, was a painter of considerable talent. He was a pupil of Lépicié,\r\nand he and Carle Vernet, who occupied the same studio, competed at the\r\nAcadémie des Beaux-Arts for the “Prix de Rome.” Carle Vernet obtained\r\nthe first prize at this concours in 1782, and Jean François Gounod\r\ncarried off the second in 1783. The latter, however, devoted himself\r\nespecially to engraving, in order that he might always live with his\r\nfather who was getting old and needed all his care and attention.\r\n\r\nJ. F. Gounod was serious, melancholy and quite original in character, as\r\nwas shown by his conduct on the death of his father, who lived to be\r\nover ninety years of age. This loss was a great grief to him, and in the\r\nhope of diverting his mind and driving off melancholy, he undertook a\r\ntramp to Versailles. He had very little money in his pocket. However,\r\nbeing fatigued by his journey he entered a public house and went to bed.\r\nHe remained several days at Versailles, but, far from being relieved of\r\nhis sad thoughts, he was so overwhelmed by them that he dreaded to\r\nreturn to his rooms in the Louvre, where he had witnessed his father\r\nbreathe his last. He wrote to a friend to say that he should not return\r\nto Paris, but intended to start immediately for Italy; he begged him to\r\ngo to his room, take from his secretary all the money he might find\r\nthere, and bring it to him at Versailles, receiving at the same time his\r\nadieux. Once in possession of his money, Gounod, who disliked\r\nencumbrance of any sort, furnished himself with a light carpet bag, and\r\nwith this baggage set off on a journey which was at that time very long\r\nand very difficult. He travelled all over Italy, remaining there four or\r\nfive years; then he returned to Paris, and to his rooms where nothing\r\nhad been disturbed, and resumed work as if he had left it only the\r\nevening before.\r\n\r\nOne of J. F. Gounod’s friends has written the following lines concerning\r\nhim: “M. Gounod has made a reputation in engraving. He has produced\r\nlittle and his income could scarcely have been enough to suffice him.\r\nNevertheless, he liked to work and engraving offered him the quiet and\r\ndeliberation which suited his disposition. In general he spoke but\r\nlittle. When he was obliged to quit the Louvre, he was quite helpless in\r\nregard to the great confusion which always characterized his apartment;\r\nit was one mass of books, pasteboard, drawings and articles of all sorts\r\nscattered about, including a dismembered skeleton, whose bones were all\r\npretty effectually separated from each other. Fortunately one of his\r\ncousins undertook to transfer for him everything that was transferable,\r\notherwise Gounod would have abandoned all. He concluded to marry, for it\r\nwas absolutely necessary that somebody should aid him in finding himself\r\nagain. He was, nevertheless, a good and excellent man. His wife was\r\ncharming, a very good musician, and it was she who educated her son. He\r\nwas getting along in years when he married, and at his death this son\r\nwas still very young.”\r\n\r\nVery young indeed, for the future author of “Faust,” “Roméo et Juliette”\r\nand “Mireille,” Charles Gounod, was scarcely five years old when he lost\r\nhis father, whom he had not learned to know. Like Hérold, like Adam,\r\nlike Halévy, Charles Gounod was born at Paris, where he first saw the\r\nlight June 17, 1818. His mother, a woman of fine character and high\r\nintelligence, neglected nothing that could contribute to his literary\r\nand artistic education. She was his first music teacher. He began very\r\nyoung to feel an intense love for this art, which he was to make\r\nillustrious. A pupil of the Saint Louis lyceum, he was already an\r\nexcellent pianist while still pursuing his classical studies at this\r\nestablishment, and before completing these studies he took up a course\r\nof harmony with the famous theoretician, Reicha. He took the degree of\r\nbachelor when he was little more than sixteen years old, and was\r\nadmitted to the Conservatoire in the class of counterpoint and fugue\r\ndirected by Halévy, and soon after in the composition class of Lesueur,\r\none of the greatest masters that ever glorified the French school. In\r\nthe following year Gounod took part in the concours of the Institute for\r\nthe “Prix de Rome,” and carried off without opposition a second grand\r\nprize. He was thus exempted from the military service, since the rules\r\nof the “Concours de Rome” established at that time this exemption for\r\nany pupil having obtained a prize before the age of twenty. This was in\r\n1837, and Gounod was only nineteen.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this same year Lesueur died, and Gounod passed under the\r\ninstruction of Paër, with whom he finished his studies. In 1838 he\r\npresented himself again at the Institute, this time without success, but\r\nin 1839 he carried off a brilliant first prize with a cantata entitled\r\n“Fernand,” the words of which were written by the marquis de Pastoret.\r\nThis first prize was almost unanimously awarded to him, twenty-five\r\nvotes out of twenty-seven being in his favor. He left at once for Rome\r\nand there devoted himself almost exclusively for three or four years, to\r\nthe study and composition of religious music, being especially charmed\r\nand influenced by the works of the great Palestrina. In 1841 he had\r\nperformed in the Saint-Louis-des Français church, on the occasion of the\r\nfête of king Louis-Philippe, a grand orchestra mass, with contralto and\r\ntenor solos. Towards the end of the following year he made a trip\r\nthrough Germany, pausing for a time in Vienna, where he gave in the\r\nSaint Charles church a Requiem mass which produced upon its hearers a\r\nmost profound impression. Some idea of the effect produced may be had\r\nfrom an account addressed to one of the Paris papers of the day, and\r\nwhich seemed invested with a spirit of prophecy: “On All Soul’s Day”\r\nsaid this writer, “there was performed at the Saint Charles church a\r\nRequiem, a quite recent work by M. Charles Gounod. One recognizes in\r\nthis composition not only a very marked musical talent which has already\r\nobtained by its assiduity and experience a high degree of independence,\r\nbut one sees in it also a great and wholly individual comprehension,\r\nwhich breaks away from the beaten tracks in order to create new forms.\r\nIn the melodic phrases there are things which deeply touch and impress\r\nthe hearer, things which disclose a grandeur of conception become very\r\nrare in our day, and which engrave themselves ineffaceably upon the\r\nsoul, things which would do honor to any musician, and which seem to\r\npoint to a great future. The solos were sung perfectly, and the choruses\r\nas well as the orchestra likewise deserve praise. M. Gounod directed in\r\nperson the performance of his work.”\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the pace of the young musician was not that of an\r\nordinary artist, and that his first steps were directed toward glory,\r\nfor rarely does one hear such praise accorded a composer of twenty-five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Gounod, already haunted by an idea which was long to pursue\r\nhim, had dreamed of bidding farewell, not to his art, but to the world,\r\nand had seriously considered taking ecclesiastic orders. His mind\r\npossessed by this fancy, he had, during the latter part of his stay at\r\nRome, left the villa Médécis, where at that time the French school was\r\nestablished, and had retired to the seminary. As soon as he returned to\r\nParis, he entered as precentor the Missions Etrangères, where he wore\r\nthe long robe and costume of the conventual house, and his resolution\r\nseemed thenceforth so certain that it was accepted as an accomplished\r\nfact. Indeed a special sheet, the _Revue et Gazette Musicale_, published\r\nthe following under date of Feb. 15, 1846: “M. Gounod, composer and\r\nformer winner of the grand Institute prize, has just taken orders.” From\r\nthis moment, Gounod was called “l’Abbé Gounod,” just as, sixty years\r\nbefore, his master Lesueur was called “l’Abbé Lesueur,” when he became\r\nprecentor of the Metropolitan church. There was this difference,\r\nhowever, that Lesueur had never desired to become a priest, but\r\naccording to the usage then in vogue at the Notre Dame church, Paris, he\r\nwas obliged, in order to fulfill the functions of precentor, to don the\r\npriestly garb. Gounod, on the other hand, seemed to have made up his\r\nmind to a religious life, since in 1846 a publisher brought out a series\r\nof religious choruses entitled “Offices of Holy Week, by the Abbé\r\nCharles Gounod.”\r\n\r\nIn his retreat Gounod continued to occupy himself with religious music,\r\nand in 1849 he had performed at the Saint Eustache church a grand solemn\r\nmass which was very well received. At this moment he seemed absolutely\r\nlost to profane art, and as he was brought very little before the\r\npublic, people began to forget about him, when there appeared in the\r\nLondon Athenæum early in 1851, an article which was immediately\r\nrepublished in the _Revue et Gazette Musicale_ of Paris, and which\r\ncontained an enthusiastic eulogium on several of Gounod’s compositions\r\nrecently performed at a concert at St. Martin’s Hall. “This music,” said\r\nthe writer, “brings before us no other composer ancient or modern,\r\neither by the form, the melody or the harmony. It is not new in the\r\nsense of being bizarre or whimsical; it is not old, if old means dry and\r\nstiff, the bare scaffolding, with no fine construction rising behind it;\r\nit is the work of an accomplished artist, it is the poetry of a new\r\npoet. * * * * * That the impression produced upon the audience was great\r\nand real there can be no doubt, but it is the music itself, not its\r\nreception, which to our minds presages for M. Gounod an uncommon career;\r\nfor if there be not in his works a genius at once true and new, then\r\nmust we go back to school and relearn the alphabet of the art and of\r\ncriticism.”\r\n\r\nThis article fell like a thunderclap on Paris, where people were\r\nscarcely giving Gounod a thought. A very distinguished French musical\r\ncritic, Louis Viardot, was then in London with his wife, the worthy and\r\nnoble sister of Malibran. This Athenæum article was attributed to him,\r\nnot without reason, I think, and it was soon known that Mme. Viardot,\r\nwhose experience, taste and musical knowledge everyone knows, was struck\r\nby the music of the young master, and that she was far from concealing\r\nher admiration for a talent so pure, so elegant and so exquisite.\r\n\r\nExcited by such a success Gounod at once renounced his orders, and\r\nentered without more delay upon the militant career of the art\r\ninterrupted for so many years. He soon produced in public a pretty\r\nsymphony in E flat, which, performed in a remarkable manner by the Saint\r\nCecilia Society, then a worthy rival of that of the Conservatoire, won\r\nhim the congratulations and sincere encouragement of the critics. Then,\r\nthanks to the assistance of Mme. Viardot, he was charged with writing\r\nfor the _Opéra_ the score of a work in three acts, “Sapho,” the libretto\r\nof which had been confided to a young poet, Emile Angier, who was\r\nlikewise in the morning of his career, and likewise destined for glory,\r\nand in this work the great artist whom we have just named, was to take\r\nthe principal rôle. Notwithstanding all, “Sapho” was not well received\r\nby the public, or at least only moderately so and scarcely achieved more\r\nthan what is called in France a success of esteem. Yet the work was an\r\nexceedingly good one, but the first step on a stage so important as that\r\nof the _Opéra_ is so difficult for a young composer to make! It must be\r\nsaid, however, that if the work as a whole was not judged entirely\r\nsatisfactory, especially in regard to the scenic effects, etc., it\r\npresented a value which a fastidious critic stated in these terms: “The\r\nopera of “Sapho,” without being a good dramatic work, is the work of a\r\ndistinguished musician who has style and lofty tendencies. M. Gounod has\r\nperfectly seized and happily rendered all the lyric parts of the subject\r\nwhich he has treated, but he has been less happy in trying to express\r\nthe conflict of passions and the contrast of characters.” Certain pages\r\nin the score of “Sapho” were remarked as being quite individual in\r\nflavor, and the public were especially delighted with the beautiful song\r\nof the young shepherd, “Brontez le Thym, Brontes mes chêvres,” as well\r\nas the admirable couplets of “Sapho,” of a character so melancholy, and\r\nan inspiration so full of a delicate poetry. The work was performed on\r\nthe 16th of April, 1851.\r\n\r\nA year later the Comédie-Française produced a tragedy by Pousard,\r\n“Ulysse,” for which Gounod had written a number of beautiful choruses,\r\nredolent with the perfume of antiquity and full of a manly energy. Very\r\nsoon the young composer appeared again at the _Opéra_ with a grand work\r\nin five acts called “La Nonne Sanglante,” the libretto of which,\r\nalthough signed by the names of Scribe and Germain Delavigne, was\r\nabsolutely devoid of interest. He made a mistake in accepting this\r\nlibretto, previously refused by several of his colleagues, among others\r\nMeyerbeer and Halévy, and which could not excite his inspiration.\r\nNotwithstanding some remarkable bits, some vigorous and beautiful\r\nscenes, the score of “La Nonne Sanglante” was really only secondary in\r\nvalue, and the work achieved a very mild success when it was produced\r\nOct. 18, 1854, with Mlles. Werthermber, Poinsot and Dameron, MM.\r\nGueymard, Depassio and Merly for interpreters. Its career was short, and\r\nit only lived through eleven performances. Gounod had not yet found his\r\nvein.\r\n\r\nBut better fortune was in store for him, and after a few years of\r\nsilence he began the series of his successes by giving to the\r\n_Théâtre-Lyrique_, then very flourishing and very brilliant under the\r\ndirection of M. Carvalho, “Le Médécin Malgré Lui.” The libretto of this\r\nhad been arranged for _Opéra Comique_ by MM. Jules Barbier and Michel\r\nCarré, who had preserved the greater part of Molière’s prose. Although\r\nfrom a general point of view the comic sentiment may not be the dominant\r\nquality of his talent, yet that quality is far from lacking in Gounod,\r\nas is proved by “Le Médécin Malgré Lui,” which remains one of the most\r\ncurious and most original of his attempts. In this work, which was\r\nperformed Jan. 15, 1858, the composer revived with a rare cleverness the\r\nold forms of French music, while adding thereto the most ingenious and\r\nmost piquant artifices of the modern science, and by clothing the whole\r\nwith his masterly style he produced a work of a very unique color,\r\nflavor and character. “Le Médécin Malgré Lui,” which the public received\r\nwith marked favor, seemed to prepare the great day of Gounod’s artistic\r\nlife. Fourteen months after the appearance of this work, that is to say,\r\non March 19, 1859, the composer gave to the same theatre the work which\r\nwas to establish his fame upon a fixed basis. The reader of course\r\ndivines that I refer to “Faust,” that masterpiece which can boast of\r\nsuch a brilliant, prolonged and universal success, and which will\r\nremain, perhaps, the author’s best title to the remembrance and\r\nrecognition of posterity.\r\n\r\nBut let it not be supposed that the triumphal career of “Faust” was not\r\nconfronted at the outset with difficulties and obstacles which appeared\r\ninsurmountable. When it was carried by the authors to the\r\n_Théâtre-Lyrique_, there was in preparation at the Porte Saint Martin\r\ntheatre another drama built on Goethe’s poem, and bearing the same name.\r\nM. Carvalho told Gounod that it would be necessary to await the result\r\nof the “Faust” at the Porte Saint Martin, for if that work won a\r\nsuccess, it would be very difficult and very hazardous to offer another\r\n“Faust” to the public. So they waited, and the drama not proving a\r\nsuccess, it was decided to proceed with the study of the opera. Gounod’s\r\n“Faust” was presented in the form styled in France _Opéra Comique_, that\r\nis to say, the singing parts being interspersed with spoken dialogue.\r\n(It was not until later when “Faust” passed into the repertoire of the\r\n_Opéra_ that this dialogue was replaced by recitatives.) The rôle of\r\nMarguerite was first given to Mme. Ugalde, but Mme. Carvalho having\r\nexpressed a desire to take the rôle, after becoming acquainted with the\r\nmusic, the authors transferred it to her and consoled Mme. Ugalde by\r\ngiving her the part of Mélodine in Victor Massé’s opera, “La Fée\r\nCarabosse,” which was being mounted at the same time. The rehearsals of\r\n“Faust” were very laborious. M. Carvalho, disconcerted by the new and\r\ndaring character of the music, and by the poetic sentiment revealed in\r\nit, which he judged incompatible with stage requirements, picked a\r\nquarrel with the composer, declared his score too much developed, and\r\nconstantly demanded new cuts and changes. Gounod, made uneasy by this\r\nlack of confidence, had yielded to several of these demands and had\r\nalready consented to several suppressions, when at last M. Carvalho came\r\nto him one day with a proposition to suppress the beautiful final scene\r\nin the garden, fearing that this quiet scene, with no outburst or noise\r\nof any kind, would seem cold to the public and fail to produce an\r\neffect. This time Gounod, who had faith in his work and was conscious of\r\nits value, stood fast and immovable, declaring he would rather withdraw\r\nhis score than to yield this point and consent to such a sacrifice. In\r\nshort, after a whole series of combats and discussions of this sort,\r\nwhich were renewed daily, the work was finally brought out. Truth\r\ncompels the confession that it was not fully understood at first; that\r\nthe critics stood hesitating and undecided in the presence of a work so\r\nnew in form, and that the public itself was of two minds regarding the\r\nvalue of the work, some applauding with enthusiasm while others harshly\r\ncriticised. It is certain that the first reception was more cold and\r\nreserved than could have been desired, but gradually people began to\r\nunderstand and appreciate the beauties abounding in this exquisite\r\nscore, and at last its success was complete, brilliant and\r\nincontestable, spreading first throughout France, then over Europe, then\r\nover the entire world, where “Faust” is to-day, and long has been,\r\nconsidered a great masterpiece, and its author’s best work. “Faust” has\r\nbeen played in all countries and translated into all languages. It is\r\none of the first French works which Italy, before then so hostile and\r\nimpenetrable to French music, has applauded with a sort of furor. In\r\nGermany, where for a number of years Spohr’s “Faust” reigned supreme, it\r\nwas received in a triumphal manner, and completely dethroned the latter.\r\nIt excited enthusiasm, not only in Vienna, Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg,\r\nBaden, Leipsic, Frankfort, Stuttgart and Darmstadt, not only in Milan,\r\nRome, Venice, Naples, Florence, Genoa, Parma and Bologna, but in London,\r\nMoscow, St. Petersburg, Varsovie, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Brussels,\r\nAmsterdam, Madrid, Barcelona, Lisbon, etc., and even finally crossed the\r\nseas and became popular in the two Americas. It is perhaps the first\r\nwork by a French composer which had such a rapid, complete and universal\r\nsuccess. In Paris, “Faust” had been played more than four hundred times\r\nat the _Théâtre-Lyrique_ when the _Opéra_ signified a desire to\r\nappropriate it. The authors consented; but certain modifications were\r\nnecessitated by this change of scene, and first of all the spoken\r\ndialogue had to be suppressed and replaced by recitatives. These changes\r\neffected, the work made its appearance at the _Opéra_ March 3, 1869, and\r\nthere continued its successful career, counting five hundred\r\nperformances in the space of eighteen years. The five hundredth was\r\ngiven on the 4th of November, 1887, and the six hundredth took place in\r\nthe beginning of the year 1892, so that in Paris alone, “Faust” has\r\nalready reached its thousandth performance. Such a success is without\r\nparallel in the annals of the theatre in France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHARLES GOUNOD.\r\n\r\n  Reproduction of an engraving made from a photograph in 1859, about the\r\n    time of the first production of Faust, Gounod being then in his\r\n    forty-first year.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGounod had borrowed “Le Médécin Malgré Lui” from Molière; he had\r\nappropriated material from Goethe’s “Faust;” it was La Fontaine who\r\nfurnished him the subject of a pretty opera, somewhat light in\r\ncharacter, called “Philémon et Baucis,” performed at the\r\n_Théâtre-Lyrique_, Feb. 18, 1860. The score of “Philémon et Baucis” is a\r\npleasant one, full of charm, in which tenderness and grace alternates\r\nwith fun and buffoonery. The work, which was in three acts, achieved\r\nonly a moderate success at the _Théâtre-Lyrique_; its real success dates\r\nfrom its transfer to the _Opéra Comique_, reduced to two acts. Since\r\nthen it has never been taken from the repertoire of that theatre. But\r\nsoon Gounod was to appear on the grand stage of the _Opéra_ with a work\r\nof large proportions, “La Reine de Saba.” Notwithstanding the fame which\r\nhis previous works had made for him, he was no more fortunate with “La\r\nReine de Saba” (Feb. 29, 1862) than he had been with “La Nonne\r\nSanglante.” It is true that this time the trouble lay principally in the\r\nlibretto of his collaborators, which was absolutely devoid of interest.\r\nFor it is but just to say that if the score of “La Reine de Saba” is of\r\nunequal merit and of a secondary character, it nevertheless contains\r\nsome superb and exquisite pages, like the noble air of Balkis, and the\r\nbeautiful chorus of the Jewesses and the Sabians. However, it only lived\r\nthrough fifteen performances at Paris, though it should be remarked that\r\nin certain foreign cities it was received with great favor, and that in\r\nBrussels and Darmstadt, among others, its success was considerable.\r\n\r\nGounod’s unfortunate attempts at the _Opéra_ led him to turn his\r\nattention anew to the _Théâtre-Lyrique_, where he brought out, March 19,\r\n1864, a work entitled “Mireille,” the subject of which was taken from a\r\npretty provincial poem by Frederic Mistral, bearing the same title,\r\n(Mireio). This poem is an exquisite pastorale, written in that\r\nprovincial language at once so musical, so sweet and harmonious, a\r\nlanguage which is melody in itself. Unhappily, the libretto which Gounod\r\nset to music on this subject was badly chosen, being ill adapted to the\r\nstage, and therefore militated against the composer’s work, although the\r\nlatter contained some truly charming pages. The first act, particularly,\r\nradiant with light and sunshine, is charmingly poetic, and especially\r\ndeserving of mention is the beautiful chorus of the magnarelles and the\r\ntouching duet of Mireille and Vincent. The score contains still other\r\ncharming bits, such as Magali’s beautiful song and Taven’s couplets:\r\nVoici la saison, mignonne. However, the defective libretto stood in the\r\nway of the success of the work, which at first remained undecided. It\r\nwas found necessary to entirely rewrite the work, to make large\r\nsuppressions, and reduce it from five to three acts, which did not\r\nresult in its being any better received by the public. It was not until\r\nlater, when it was transferred to the _Opéra Comique_ after having been\r\nsubjected to still further revisions and cast in its final form, that\r\n“Mireille” at last found the success which its incontestable musical\r\nvalue merited. Thereafter, it never left the repertoire of that theatre.\r\n\r\nNo particular importance can be attached to a little work in two acts,\r\n“La Colombe,” which Gounod gave to the _Opéra Comique_ in 1866, and\r\nwhich he had written some years before for the theatre at Baden; it was\r\na sort of salon operetta, without special character or consequence. But\r\nthe composer was yet to carry off one of the most brilliant victories of\r\nhis career with “Roméo et Juliette” which made its first appearance at\r\nthe _Théâtre-Lyrique_ on the 27th of April, 1867. More fortunate than\r\n“Faust” and “Mireille,” whose success had been so difficult to\r\nestablish, “Roméo et Juliette” was well received from the very outset,\r\nand this superb score in which the passion of love and the sentiment of\r\nchivalry are so happily united, immediately found favor with the public.\r\nNor has it ever ceased to excite public sympathy, and it has changed its\r\nbiding-place from the _Théâtre-Lyrique_ to the _Opéra Comique_, and from\r\nthat theatre to the _Opéra_ without experiencing any diminution of\r\npublic interest. “Roméo et Juliette” has exceeded the number of five\r\nhundred performances in Paris, one hundred of which were at the\r\n_Théâtre-Lyrique_, about three hundred at the _Opéra Comique_ and more\r\nthan one hundred at the _Opéra_. Outside of France it has not been less\r\nsuccessful, and it has made a part of the repertoire of all the great\r\ntheatres of Europe.\r\n\r\nMoreover, “Roméo et Juliette” marks the culminating point in the career\r\nof Gounod, who since then has not been able to equal its success. In\r\n1870 the master went to London where he remained for several years,\r\nworking and producing much. There it was that he wrote, among other\r\nthings, an opera called “George Dandin,” to the prose of Molière, which\r\nhas not yet been performed; it was there also that he wrote, for the\r\nUniversal Exposition at London in 1871, a grand cantata entitled\r\n“Gallia,” which was performed later at Paris, where it was very\r\nfavorably received. A warm welcome was also given to the music which\r\nGounod wrote for “Jeanne d’Arc,” a drama in verse by Jules Barbier which\r\nwas performed at the Gaiety on Nov. 8, 1873. This music consisted of\r\nmelodramas, interludes, choruses, etc., and contained some very\r\ninteresting pages. The preceding year the Ventadour theatre had brought\r\nout a drama in verse by Ernest Legouvé for which Gounod had written a\r\nscore of the same kind; this drama was called “Les Deux Reines de\r\nFrance.”\r\n\r\nIn these two works the music was merely an accessory, and the composer\r\nwas only the humble servant of the poet, whom he discreetly aided and\r\nsupplemented. But Gounod had not given up the idea of appearing again\r\nbefore the public as a true dramatic musician. Ten years had elapsed\r\nsince he had given “Roméo et Juliette,” and the public were growing\r\nimpatient for a new work from him, when in 1877 the _Opéra Comique_\r\nannounced the performance of “Cinq-Mars.” This was an artistic treat in\r\nwhich all Paris desired to participate, but which did not wholly justify\r\nthe hopes which it had raised. The score of “Cinq-Mars” was certainly\r\nfar from being worthless; it was written in a musical language that was\r\nsuperb and noble in style, but aside from a few exquisite pages, it did\r\nnot have the freshness, the abundance and the generosity of inspiration\r\nwhich had hitherto characterized Gounod’s work. It was unequal, cold at\r\nintervals, and one no longer felt that vigor of youth, that warmth of\r\naccent which had made the triumph of the master’s great productions. In\r\na word “Cinq-Mars” was received with sympathy but not enthusiasm, and as\r\nsoon as the novelty had passed it disappeared without causing any\r\ndisquietude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GOUNOD’S RESIDENCE ON BOULEVARD MALESHERBES IN PARIS.\r\n\r\n  From a photograph made in April, 1891.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe following year Gounod presented himself again at the _Opéra_. For a\r\nlong time past he had felt the desire to attempt one of the Corneille’s\r\nmasterpieces, and he had formed the plan of setting “Polyeucte” to\r\nmusic, and transforming it into a lyric drama. It was a subject half\r\nreligious, half profane, which seemed peculiarly suited to his\r\nintellectual temperament. He charged his friend, Jules Barbier, with\r\nfashioning a libretto from Corneille’s celebrated tragedy, which the\r\nlatter followed step by step, even preserving some of the great poet’s\r\nverses, and he wrote the music of this new “Polyeucte,” which was\r\nperformed at the _Opéra_, Oct. 7, 1878. But it was said that the author\r\nof “Faust” and “Roméo,” both so successful at the _Opéra_, after having\r\nbeen born and bred elsewhere, could never succeed at that theatre with a\r\nwork written expressly for it. “Polyeucte,” indeed, was not well\r\nreceived, and scarcely deserved to be, and its career ended with a\r\nseries of twenty-nine performances. The composer was not much more\r\nfortunate with “Le Tribut de Zamora,” another work which he gave to the\r\n_Opéra_, April 1, 1881. This work, however, had been staged with great\r\nsplendor and magnificence, the costumes and decorations were very rich\r\nand elaborate, and what was still more important, the two principal\r\nrôles were taken by artists of the first rank, M. Lassalle and Mme.\r\nGabrielle Krauss, the latter especially being very fine in the character\r\nof Xaïma. But nothing could counteract the insipidity and insignificance\r\nof the work, and notwithstanding the luxury brought to its support,\r\nnotwithstanding the incontestable talent of its interpreters, “Le Tribut\r\nde Zamora” scarcely lived through fifty performances. This was the last\r\ndramatic effort of Charles Gounod, who seems to-day to have finally\r\ngiven up the theatre, and whose health has been steadily declining for a\r\nnumber of years.\r\n\r\nBut Gounod has not confined himself exclusively to the theatre; his very\r\nremarkable fertility has exercised itself in all directions,\r\nparticularly in the religious genre, so well suited to his nature.\r\nGounod’s religious compositions are very numerous, and since he has\r\nrenounced the stage he has achieved some striking successes in oratorio.\r\n“La Redemption,” (1882) a sacred trilogy, of which he wrote the music\r\nand the French words, and “Mors et Vita,” another sacred trilogy, the\r\nLatin text of which he arranged himself from the Catholic liturgy and\r\nthe Vulgate, won for him triumphs which the great merit of these\r\nbeautiful compositions fully justified. Since his youth Gounod has\r\nproduced a great number of sacred works, several of which are of rare\r\nbeauty, such as the “Messe des Orphéonistes” (1853), the “Messe de\r\nSainte Cécile” (1855), a mass in C minor (1867), a mass of the Sacred\r\nHeart (1876), a mass to the memory of Joan of Arc (1887), a mass for two\r\nvoices, a short mass in C major, three solemn masses, two Requiem\r\nmasses, a “Stabat Mater,” a “Te Deum,” a hymn to Saint Augustin, “Les\r\nSept Paroles du Christ,” “Jésus sur le lac de Tibériade,” a choral\r\npsalmody, “Tobie,” a little oratorio, and a considerable number of\r\nmotets of different kinds.\r\n\r\nIn profane music, and aside from the theatre, Gounod has shown himself\r\nscarcely less fertile. His two symphonies, (first in D, second in E\r\nflat) and his “Temple de l’Harmonie,” cantata with choruses, are all\r\ncompositions of great merit. I would mention also “Biondina,” a pretty\r\nlittle lyric poem, and especially would I call attention to his\r\nbeautiful male choruses, and to his songs of which he has written more\r\nthan a hundred, and among which are to be found veritable masterpieces\r\nof poetry and sentiment, such as “Le Vallon,” “Le Soir,” “Medjé,”\r\n“l’Envoi de Fleurs,” “Le Printemps,” “La Prière du Soir,” “Venise,” etc.\r\nIn this style of composition Gounod’s repertoire is varied, substantial\r\nand charming, and few French writers have given us a note so personal\r\nand original.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to characterize the genius of Gounod, and to determine the\r\nplace which he should occupy in the history of contemporaneous art, it\r\nis necessary to consider principally “Faust” and “Roméo et Juliette.”\r\nThese are his two masterpieces, and it is through these works that the\r\ncomposer has truly revealed his personality and his genius; it is\r\nthrough these works that his name has become famous and will go down to\r\nposterity. It is of these works, then, that we must demand the secret of\r\nthat powerful influence which Gounod has exerted for more than a quarter\r\nof a century over the art, over artists and over the public.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fac-simile autograph manuscript from Gounod’s “Romeo and Juliet.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nAlthough not performed until a year after “Le Médécin Malgré Lui,”\r\n“Faust” was written first. In this work the musician had been\r\nintelligently served by his collaborators, who had taken from Goethe’s\r\nmasterpiece all that which pertained to the action and to the dramatic\r\npassion, and left judiciously alone all the psychological, philosophical\r\nand metaphysical dissertations. The libretto was admirably cut for the\r\nstage, varied in tone and coloring, and contained a fair quota of that\r\nfantastic element so effective on the stage and so well liked by the\r\npublic. And never was the musician better inspired. The Kermesse scene\r\nis full of warmth and sunshine; the garden scene is one of an ethereal\r\nand enchanting poetry, and the words of passion are by turns softly\r\nlanguishing or full of an intense energy; the scene in the church, where\r\nMephistopheles, pursuing Marguerite even to the very shades of the\r\nsanctuary, tries to arrest her prayer, and prevent the unfortunate\r\nvictim from taking refuge in the Divine mercy, is stamped with a rare\r\nfeeling of grandeur, and reveals a profoundly dramatic character.\r\nFinally, the episode of the death of Valentine and his malediction of\r\nMarguerite forms a pathetic and superb scene, which, with its numerous\r\nand varied incidents is surely one of the best of this remarkable work.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular thing that the two musicians whose personal and\r\noriginal genius characterize in some sort, from points of view otherwise\r\nvery different, the reform tendencies of the present French school,\r\nshould both fall upon these two great masterpieces, “Faust” and “Roméo\r\net Juliette,” each interpreting them after his own manner and according\r\nto his own temperament. It was Berlioz who first conceived the idea of\r\nappropriating them, and long before Gounod had dreamed of such a thing,\r\nhad given us “Roméo et Juliette” and his “Damnation de Faust.”\r\nComparison between the works of these two artists is impossible, because\r\nof the dissimilarity of their natures and aspirations. In regard to\r\n“Faust,” however, we may say that Berlioz, who did not make an opera of\r\nit, but a grand musical legend, preserving thus one of the peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of the original work, treated especially the energetic\r\nand picturesque part of the drama, whereas Gounod chose rather to\r\nreproduce the love poetry, the exalted reverie and that mystic and\r\nsupernatural perfume which characterizes Goethe’s poem. Although the\r\ncharming Kermesse scene in Gounod’s score, which is an episode apart\r\nfrom the action, is very well executed, highly colored, of a really\r\nexceptional musical interest, it cannot be denied that in picturesque\r\nsentiment Berlioz has singularly surpassed his rival in the various and\r\ntypical episodes of his “Damnation de Faust,” the latin song of the\r\nstudents, the soldier’s chorus, the Hungarian march, the ballet of the\r\nsylphs, the military retreat, the chorus of the sylphs and gnomes, etc.\r\nOn the other hand, whatever is tender and emotional, dreamy and poetic,\r\nhas been admirably treated by Gounod, and it is by certain unobtrusive\r\nfragments, certain almost hidden passages in his score that the hand of\r\na master, the inspiration of a poet is betrayed, that the man of genius\r\nis revealed. Witness Marguerite’s response to Faust as he approaches her\r\nat the entrance of the chapel:\r\n\r\n            “Non, monsieur, je ne suis demoiselle ni belle,\r\n            Et je n’ai pas besoin qu’on me donne la main.”\r\n\r\nor Marguerite’s reflection in her garden,\r\n\r\n          “Je voudrais bien savoir quel était ce jeune homme,\r\n          Si c’est un grand seigneur et comment il se nomme.”\r\n\r\nNot only are these two fragments perfect, finished, exquisite, from a\r\nmusical point of view, but they exhale besides I know not what\r\nmysterious perfume. They give the hearer so complete a perception of the\r\nsentiment which Marguerite is fated to prove for “Faust,” that they\r\nhave, aside from the scenic import, a kind of mystic and profound\r\nmeaning which seems impossible to translate into music, and which\r\nstrikes, nevertheless, the most indifferent ears. It is this peculiar,\r\nwe may say hitherto unknown sense, which gives Gounod’s “Faust” its true\r\ncolor, its character at once tender and dreamy, mysterious and\r\nfascinating, melancholy and passionate, and which assigns to it a place\r\napart, a unique place among the number of the most original works of\r\ncontemporary art. It is easy to see in this work that Gounod’s\r\nintellectual tendencies, his youthful sympathies, his leanings toward a\r\nreligious and monastic life, have not been without influence on his\r\nmusical temperament, and on the very nature of his talent.\r\n\r\nIf “Faust” is an exquisite work, “Roméo et Juliette” is a superb one, of\r\na grand and spirited style, in which the external and material picture\r\nof a chivalric world contrasts strikingly with the internal analysis of\r\na passionate love, constrained to conceal itself from all eyes, yet from\r\nthis very cause becoming all the more powerful. If one wished to enter\r\ninto what might be called a psychological analysis of the score, it\r\nwould be necessary to discover how great were the difficulties of the\r\ncomposer in writing “Roméo” without repeating himself, after having\r\nwritten “Faust.” For, although the subjects of the two works differ\r\nwidely, we see the same situations reproduced in each, under the same\r\nscenic conditions, and the stumbling block was all the more troublesome\r\nsince these situations were the most salient ones, and constituted, as\r\nit were, the very core of the dramatic action. Witness the balcony scene\r\nof “Roméo” and the garden scene of “Faust” or the duel of Roméo and\r\nTybalt with the death of the latter, in the first, and the duel of Faust\r\nand Valentine, also mortal, in the second. Truly a musician must have a\r\nsingular power, a very remarkable faculty of reiteration, to attempt\r\nsuccessfully such a repetition of similar episodes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GOUNOD IN HIS STUDY.\r\n\r\n  Reproduction of a photograph from life made by Dornac & Cie., Paris.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnd what scene so marvelous as that balcony scene of Roméo, chaste and\r\npassionate throughout! What earnest and trembling accents on the lips of\r\nthe two fond lovers whom the world—a world of strife and\r\ncontention—seems bound to separate forever! And what newness, what a\r\nwinning fearlessness, what a balmy freshness in the melodic sentiment\r\nwhich the composer employs to express the sensations which stir the\r\nhearts of his tender heroes! Could love be expressed in a more exquisite\r\nand more touching manner?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, and by contrast, what scene more striking in its\r\ngrandeur, more spirited, more manly, than that of the double duel,\r\nTybalt and Mercutio, Roméo and Tybalt! Here the musician has so\r\nwonderfully colored his inspiration that he has raised up a world of the\r\npast before our very eyes, and, while listening, we feel that surely we\r\nmust be present at one of the cruel episodes of that long and bloody\r\nstruggle between the Capulets and the Montagues. The insult slung by\r\nTybalt in the face of Roméo, agitated, but contained, Mercutio’s\r\nobjurgations, the first duel of the latter with Tybalt, who strikes him\r\nto the heart, Roméo’s rage at seeing his friend expire, the fury with\r\nwhich he throws himself in his turn upon Tybalt, and the second combat,\r\nfatal to the latter, all this the composer has rendered in an admirable\r\nmanner, with a spirit, a verve, a power, a dramatic movement and a\r\npicturesque feeling which make of this episode a page full of grandeur,\r\nand worthy to compete with the painting of a Titian or of a Veronese. In\r\nconsidering this remarkable score, so rich from beginning to end and so\r\nvaried in its unity, we cannot pass over the austere and touching\r\nmarriage scene, the lark duo and the episode of the death of the two\r\nlovers. Truly, it is a work of the highest order, which yields in\r\nnothing to “Faust,” and is perhaps superior to it in certain parts and\r\nin certain ways.\r\n\r\nIt is in “Faust” and “Roméo” that Gounod has not only given the full\r\nmeasure of his genius, but has made most conspicuous the true personal\r\ntendencies of that genius and his own originality. It is there that his\r\nmusical phrase, so fascinating, so new in form and characteristic in\r\noutline, is developed in all its fullness and all its freedom. It is\r\nthere that his harmonies, so rich, so refined, so piquant, and sometimes\r\nso unexpected, are the most abundantly and happily displayed. It is\r\nthere that his ingenious instrumentation, full of color and grace and\r\nalways elegant, that transparent instrumentation we might say, at the\r\nsame time dignified and full, has embraced those exquisite passages\r\nwhich always thrill delicate and sensitive ears. It is there that\r\npassion speaks a truly enchanting language, that emotion attains the\r\nhighest limits of its power, and it is the aggregate of all these\r\nqualities which make the master’s genius stand out in bold relief and\r\nwhich shows it off in the most complete and striking fashion.\r\n\r\nBut if “Faust” and “Roméo” are worthy of so much admiration, that does\r\nnot mean that no importance or sympathy should be attached to the\r\ncomposer’s other works, which, though less perfect and less lofty in\r\ncharacter, are none the less deserving of the most active appreciation\r\non the part of the public and of true artists. “Philémon et Baucis,”\r\n“Mireille,” “Le Médécin Malgré Lui,” are productions of unquestionable\r\nmerit, and even in “Sapho” and “La Reine de Saba,” weak and unequal as\r\nthey undoubtedly are, one may find pages of the rarest beauty. It should\r\nbe remarked that even in his least successful works, what we may always\r\nadmire in Gounod is the noblesse of his language and the splendor of his\r\nstyle. It is necessary to add that if, as is generally believed,\r\nfertility is a sign of force, Gounod deserves to be classed among the\r\nstrongest! Few artists, indeed, have produced more or in greater\r\nvariety, opera, oratorio, symphony, religious music, cantatas, vocal\r\nchamber music, (set to French, English or Italian words) choruses with\r\nor without accompaniment, compositions for piano or organ, he has\r\ntouched them all, and in all has given proof of the most substantial and\r\nbrilliant qualities.\r\n\r\nA very convincing proof of the power of Gounod’s personality is the\r\ninfluence which he has exerted for more than quarter of a century on the\r\nyoung French school of music. The author of Faust has brought into the\r\nart a note entirely new and unknown before him. This dreamy, poetic note\r\nis stamped with a grace and melancholy which characterizes all of\r\nGounod’s work, and vainly have young musicians sought to reproduce and\r\ntried their best to imitate the methods of a master whose genius they\r\ndid not possess, and who remained for them inimitable. Nevertheless,\r\nthis influence of Gounod is the sign and the proof of his creative\r\npower.\r\n\r\nOne could scarcely pass over, in speaking of such an artist, his\r\nliterary proclivities, and the desire which he manifested on different\r\noccasions to set forth his ideas and the principles which he professed\r\nin matters of art. All French musicians of the present period are\r\nafflicted with a mania for writing. Not only great artists like Reyer\r\nand Saint-Saëns, following the example of Berlioz, Halévy and Adolpe\r\nAdam, undertake to criticise and make themselves the judges of their\r\ncolleagues, but the most inconsequential composer of operettas gives\r\nhimself to-day the airs of a writer, and believes himself called upon to\r\ndeliver himself of long esthetic and philosophic discussions on the art\r\nof which he deems himself one of the noblest representatives.\r\n\r\nGounod has not escaped the general contagion. It is only just to state,\r\nhowever, that he has not abused his pen in this connection, and that\r\nusually it has been occasion, rather than preconceived desire, that has\r\ncaused him to take it up. The most important writing which we owe to\r\nGounod is the remarkable volume which he has published under the title\r\nof “Le ‘Don Juan’ de Mozart,” in which he expresses very clearly his\r\nprofound admiration for the master, of whom he declares himself to be\r\none of the most ardent, respectful and faithful of disciples. In\r\naddition to this Gounod has given to various journals or periodicals\r\nsome articles of running criticism or of musical philosophy (“De la\r\nRoutine en Matière d’Art,” “Le Public,” “La Critique,” “Les Compositeurs\r\nChefs d’Orchestre,” “La Propriété Artistique,” “l’Enseignement,” “La\r\nCritique Musicale Anglaise,” “Les Pères de l’Eglise de la Musique,”\r\netc.) He has also given an interesting preface to the volume of “Lettres\r\nIntimes” by Berlioz, and he has published a preface intended to\r\naccompany his score of “George Dandin,” a score which has not yet seen\r\nthe light and perhaps never will. He enumerated and discussed in this\r\ncurious preface the reasons which led him to set prose to music—and what\r\nprose! That of Molière; in other words, the most compact, substantial\r\nand solid prose which it is possible to imagine. Some years since a\r\nreport was spread abroad that Gounod was preparing a book in which he\r\nwould refute the doctrines and theories of Richard Wagner. I do not know\r\nwhether he really ever conceived such a project, but if he did I regret\r\nthat he did not put it in execution. For it seems to me that whatever\r\nmight be his ideas on this subject it would be an exceedingly\r\ninteresting thing, to have an artist like Gounod express his opinions on\r\nan artist like Wagner.\r\n\r\nI return to Gounod the composer. However little enthusiasm his\r\ndetractors—for he has them—may feel for his genius, they are none the\r\nless obliged to confess that genius, and the power and influence exerted\r\nby him upon the public—a public which everywhere, in all the countries\r\nof the world, has applauded his works. The artists who are sharply\r\ndiscussed are usually the ones who possess true worth. More noble than\r\nmajestic, more tender than pathetic, more pensive than enthusiastic,\r\nmore deliberate than spontaneous, the immense talent of the author of\r\n“Faust” glitters with a multitude of rare qualities, and in that talent\r\none may almost say that study, constant and indefatigable study, has as\r\ngreat a part as inspiration. Not only is Gounod a fine man of letters,\r\nwell versed in the knowledge of the languages and of masterpieces, but,\r\nfrom a musical point of view, few artists have, like him, been nourished\r\nby the marrow of lions. There is no great musician whom Gounod does not\r\nknow, as it were, by heart, and he has only enthusiastic admiration for\r\nthe old masters. It was he, who, listening one day at the Conservatoire\r\nto Beethoven’s Choral Symphony, ran up to a friend and cried, his face\r\nall aglow and wildly waving the score, “It is the Bible of the\r\nmusician!” On another occasion when, at a certain salon, conversation\r\nfell on music, and the proper rank of the different musicians was under\r\ndiscussion, he delivered himself of the following sentiment. “If the\r\ngreatest masters, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, could be annihilated by an\r\nunheard-of cataclysm, as the painters might be by fire, it would be easy\r\nto reconstruct all the music with Bach. In the firmament of art, Bach is\r\na nebula which has not yet condensed.”\r\n\r\nI have said that study is almost as great a part as inspiration in the\r\ntalent of Gounod, which may be said of all truly superior artists; one\r\nmight add that this talent acquired a very individual color from the\r\nalliance of the artist’s almost mystic sentiments with a very keen\r\ncomprehension of the human passions and the storms of the heart. There\r\nhas remained by Gounod a sort of recollection of his first years vowed\r\nby him to theological studies and of his leaning toward a monastic life\r\nand the seclusion of the cloister; possibly it is this which\r\ncharacterizes his genius in such a special way, which gives it its\r\noriginality, its peculiar and its exceptional flavor, although it is\r\ndifficult to determine with precision how much his artistic personality\r\ngained and how much it lost by the influence of the ideas and\r\naspirations of his youth upon his later imagination.\r\n\r\nMusically and dramatically Gounod is more of a spiritualist than\r\nmaterialist, more poet than painter, more elegiac and vigorous than\r\ndeeply pathetic; this is perhaps the reason that some have pronounced\r\nhim lacking in dramatic sense. In this they are mistaken, for it is not\r\ndramatic sense, that is to say, impassioned perception, which sometimes\r\nfails Gounod; it is, properly speaking, temperament. But after all is\r\nsaid, the author of “Faust,” of “Mireille” and of “Roméo” remains a true\r\npoet, an inspired creator, an artist of the first rank, and if not one\r\nof those who illumine the world with a dazzling light, at least one of\r\nthose who charm it, who touch it, who make it listen and make it think,\r\nHis part is a sufficiently beautiful one, with which he may well be\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arthur Pougin]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Composer]]\r\n\r\nPUBLISHERS’ NOTE.—Since the foregoing was written, the death of Charles\r\nGounod has been announced.
