In the Harvard College\r\nLibrary is deposited the fruit of a slight effort in that direction, a\r\ndiminutive volume dated two centuries back, the title page of which\r\n(agog with queer italics) reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nHISTORY\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nDION CASSIUS\r\n\r\nABBRIDG'D BY XIPHILIN\r\n\r\nCONTAINING\r\n\r\nThe most considerable Passages under the _Roman_ emperors from the\r\ntime of _Pompey_ the Great, to the Reign of _Alexander Severus_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Two Volumes\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDone from the _Greek_, by Mr. Manning\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTametsi haudquaquam par gloria sequatur Scriptorem, & Authorem rerum,\r\ntamen in primis arduum videtur res gestas scribere. Salust.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_London_: Printed for _A._ and _J. Churchill_, in _Paternoster Row_,\r\n1704.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour hundred and seven small pages, over and above the Epistle\r\nDedicatory, are contained in Volume One. Really, however, this is not\r\nthe true Dio at all, but merely his shadow, seized and distorted to\r\nsatisfy the ideas of his epitomizer, the monk Xiphilinus, who was\r\nseparated from him by a thousand years in the flesh and another\r\nthousand in the spirit. Of the little specimens here and there\r\ntranslated for this man's or that man's convenience no mention need\r\nhere be made. Hence, practically speaking, Dio now for the first time\r\nemerges in his impressive stature before the English-speaking public\r\nafter there has elapsed since his own day a period twice as long as\r\nthen constituted the extent of that history which was his theme.\r\n\r\nThe present version, begun while I was serving as Acting Professor of\r\nGreek at St. Stephen's College, Annandale, N.Y., has been carried\r\nforward during such intervals of leisure as I could snatch from an\r\noverflowing schedule at the University of South Dakota. It has been my\r\ncompanion on many journeys and six states have witnessed its progress\r\ntoward completion. In spite of the time consumed it seems in\r\nretrospect not far short of presumptuous to have tried in three or\r\nfour years to put into acceptable English what Dio spent twelve in\r\nwriting down. Yet the task was not quite the same, for half of this\r\nhistorian's books have been caught up and whirled away in the cyclone\r\nof time; and who knows whether they still possess any resting-place\r\nabove or beneath the earth?\r\n\r\nThe text originally chosen as the basis for the translation was that\r\nof Melber, the idea of the translator being that the Teubner edition\r\nwould be the most convenient and readily obtainable standard of\r\nreference for any one who wished to compare the Greek and the English.\r\nHence the numbering of the Fragments is that of Melber (subdivisions\r\nare distinguished by a notation simpler than that of the original\r\n\"sections\"). Since no Teubner volumes beyond the second proved to be\r\nforthcoming, the rest of the work followed the stereotyped Tauchnitz\r\nedition, which also enjoys a large circulation. This text, however,\r\ncontained so many cases of corruption and clumsiness that it seemed\r\nbest to work over carefully nearly all of the latter portion of the\r\nEnglish and to embody as many as possible of the improvements of\r\nBoissevain. Incidentally Boissevain's interior arrangement of all the\r\nlater books was adopted, though it was deemed preferable (for mere\r\nreadiness of reference) to adhere to the old external division of\r\nbooks established by Leunclavius. (Boissevain's changes are, however,\r\nindicated.) The Tauchnitz text with all its inaccuracies endeavors to\r\npresent a coherent and readable narrative, and this is something which\r\nthe exactitude of Boissevain does not at all times permit. In the\r\ntranslation I have striven to follow a conservative course, and at\r\nsome points a straightforward narrative interlarded with brackets will\r\ngive evidence of its origin in Tauchnitz, whereas at others loose,\r\ndisjointed paragraphs betray the hand of Boissevain who would not\r\nwillingly let Xiphilinus and Dio ride in the same compartment. My main\r\ndesire through it all has been not so much to attain a logical unity\r\nof form as to present a history which shall look well and read well in\r\nEnglish. For this reason also I have banished most of the Fragments\r\n(which must have only a comparatively limited interest) to the last\r\nvolume and have replaced them in my first by portions of Zonaras\r\n(taken from Melber) which have their origin in Dio and are at the same\r\ntime clear, comprehensible, and connected.\r\n\r\nShould any person object that even so my text does not offer eye and\r\near a pellucid field for smooth advance, I must reply that the\r\noriginal is likewise very far from being a serene and joyous highway;\r\nand it has not appeared to me necessary or desirable to improve upon\r\nthe form of Dio's record further than the difference in the genius of\r\nthe two languages demanded. I am reminded here of what Francisque\r\nReynard says regarding the difficulties of Boccaccio, and because of a\r\nsimilarity in the situation I venture to quote from the preface of his\r\n(French) version of the Decameron:\r\n\r\n\"Dans son admiration exclusive des anciens, Boccace a pris pour modele\r\nCiceron et sa longue periode academique, dans laquelle les incidences\r\nse greffent sur les incidences, poursuivant l'idee jusqu'au bout, et\r\nne la laissant que lorsqu'elle est epuisee, comme le souffle ou\r\nl'attention de celui qui lit.... Aussi le plus souvent sa phraseologie\r\nest-elle fort complexe, et pour suivre le fil de l'idee premiere,\r\nfaut-il apporter une attention soutenue. Ce qui est deja une\r\ndifficulte de lecture dans le texte italien, devient un obstacle\r\ntres serieux quand on a a traduire ces interminables phrases en\r\nfrancais moderne, prototype de precision, de clarte, de logique\r\ngrammaticale.... Je sais bien qu'il y a un moyen commode de\r\nl'eluder...: c'est de couper les phrases et d'en faire, d'une seule,\r\ndeux, trois, quatre, autant qu'il est besoin. Mais a ce jeu on change\r\nnotablement la physionomie de l'original, et c'est ce que je ne puis\r\nadmettre.\"\r\n\r\nAs is Boccaccio to Cicero, so is Cassius Dio, _mutatis mutandis_, to\r\nThukydides; and of course the imitator improves upon the model.\r\nImagine a man who out-Paters Pater when Pater shall be but a memory,\r\nand you begin to secure a vision of the style of this Roman senator,\r\nwho accentuates every peculiarity of the tragic historian's packed\r\nperiods; and whereas his great predecessor made sentences so long as\r\nto cause mediaeval scholars heartily to wish him in the Barathron,\r\nbooks and all, comes forward six hundred years later marshaling phrase\r\nupon phrase, clause upon clause, till a modern is forced to exclaim:\r\n\"What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?\" Now I have\r\ndealt with these complexes in different ways; and sometimes I have\r\ncleft and hacked and wrenched them out of all semblance of their\r\noriginal shape, and sometimes I have hauled them almost entire, like a\r\ncable, tangled with particles, out of the sea-bed of departed days.\r\n\r\nThis principle of inconsistency which I have pursued in varying the\r\nrendering of long sentences, periodic or loose, according to external\r\nmodifying conditions, may be observed also in certain other features\r\nof the book. For I have felt obliged to allow inconsistency of letter\r\nin the hope of approaching a consistency of spirit. I suppose that the\r\nideal plan to follow in a translation would be to let a given English\r\nword represent a given Greek word, so that \"beautiful\" should occur as\r\nmany times in the English version as [Greek: kalos] in the original,\r\nand \"strength\" as many times as [Greek: rhome]. Such a scheme,\r\nhowever, is not feasible in a passage of any length, and its\r\nimpossibility simply goes to show what a makeshift translation is and\r\nalways has been, after all. Therefore single Greek words will be found\r\nreproduced by various English terms, but with that color which seems\r\nbest adapted to the context.\r\n\r\nAgain, in spelling I have chosen a method not unknown to recent\r\nhistorians, which consists in anglicising familiar proper names that\r\nare household words, like Antony, Catiline, etc., but keeping the\r\nclassical Latin form for persons less well known, as Antonius the\r\ngrandfather of Mark Antony. To the names of gods I have given a Latin\r\ndress unless a particular god happened to be named by a Greek on Greek\r\nsoil. Similarly in geographical or topographical designations the\r\ntranslator of Dio must needs confront a more difficult situation than\r\ndid Dio himself. Greek reduces _all_ names to its own basis. In\r\nEnglish one must often select from the Latin form, Greek form, Native\r\nform, or Anglicised form. Since Dio lived in Italy and was to all\r\nintents and purposes a Roman I decided to make the Latin form the\r\nstandard, and admit rarely the Anglicised form, less often the Greek,\r\nand least often the Native. As to the minutiae of spelling I need\r\nscarcely say that I have been tremendously aided by Boissevain's\r\nexhaustive studies, briefly summarized in his notes. This painstaking\r\ncare, for which he feels almost obliged to apologize, will lend a\r\npermanent lustre to his invaluable work.\r\n\r\nThat many errors must have crept into an undertaking of this magnitude\r\nI have only too vivid forebodings, and this in spite of no\r\ninconsiderable efforts of mine to avoid them: herein I can but beg the\r\nclemency of my readers and judges and hope that such faults may be\r\nfound to be mostly of a minor character. And perhaps I can do no\r\nbetter than to make common cause at once with Mr. Francis Manning\r\nwhose book I recently mentioned; for, in his Epistle Dedicatory \"To\r\nThe | Right Honourable | CHARLES | Earl of Orrery\", he voices as well\r\nas possible the feelings with which I write on the dedication page the\r\nname of Professor Gildersleeve:\r\n\r\n\"Your Lordship will forgive me for detaining you thus long with\r\nrelation to the Work I have made bold to present you with in our own\r\nTongue. How well it is perform'd, I must leave entirely to my Readers.\r\nI assume nothing to myself but an endeavour to make my Author speak\r\nintelligible _English_. I shall only add what my Subject leads me to,\r\nand what for my Reader's sake I ought to mention: That as there are\r\nbut few Authors that can present any Book to your Lordship in most\r\nother Languages, and on most of the Learned Subjects, but might wish\r\nthey had been assisted by your Lordship's Skill and Knowledge therein,\r\nas well as Patronage and Protection; so the Translator of this _Greek_\r\nHistorian in particular must lament, that notwithstanding all his\r\nIndustry and Pains, he is faln infinitely short of that great\r\nJudgment, Nicety and Criticism in the _Greek_ Language, which your\r\nLordship has in your Writings made appear to the World.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDio has long served as a source to writers treating topics of greater\r\nor less length in Roman history. He is now presented entire to the\r\ncasual reader: his veracious narrative must ever continue to interest\r\nthe historical student, who may correct him by others or others by\r\nhim, the ecclesiastic, to whom is here offered so graphic a picture of\r\nthe conditions surrounding early Christianity, and the literary man,\r\nwho finds the limpid stream of Hellenic diction far from its source\r\ngrow turbid and turgid in turning the mill wheels for this dealer in\r\n[Greek: onkos]. Dio's faults are patent, but his excellencies,\r\nfortunately, are patent, too; and the world may rejoice that in an age\r\nof lust and bloodshed this serious-minded magistrate bethought him to\r\nrecord with religious exactness what he believed to be the truth\r\nrespecting the Kingdom, the Republic, and the Empire of Rome even to\r\nhis own day.\r\n\r\nI desire in conclusion to express especial gratitude and appreciation\r\nfor assistance and suggestions to Professor C.W.E. Miller of Johns\r\nHopkins University, Professors J.H. Wright and A.A. Howard of Harvard\r\nUniversity, and to Mr. A.T. Robinson of the Massachusetts Institute of\r\nTechnology. Likewise I must acknowledge my obligations, in the\r\nelucidation of particularly vexed and corrupt passages, to the\r\nilluminative comments of Sturz, or Wagner, or Gros, or Boissee, or all\r\ncombined. Additional thanks are due to many others who have helped or\r\nshall yet help to make Dio in English a success.\r\n\r\nHERBERT BALDWIN FOSTER.\r\n\r\nBETHLEHEM, PENNSYLVANIA,\r\n     June, 1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCERNING THE ORIGINAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.--THE WRITING.\r\n\r\n\r\nCassius Dio Cocceianus, Roman senator and praetor, when about forty\r\nyears of age delivered himself of a pamphlet describing the dreams and\r\nomens that had led the general Septimius Severus to hope for the\r\nimperial office which he actually secured. One evening there came to\r\nthe author a note of thanks from the prince; and the temporary\r\nsatisfaction of the recipient was continued in his dreams, wherein his\r\nguiding angel seemed to urge him to write a detailed account of the\r\nreign of the unworthy Commodus (Book Seventy-two), just ended. Once\r\nagain did Dio glow beneath the imperial felicitations and those of the\r\npublic. Inoculated with the bacillus of publication and animated by a\r\nstrong desire for immortality,--a wish happily realized,--he undertook\r\nthe prodigious task of giving to the world a complete account of Roman\r\nevents from the beginning to so late a date as Fortune might\r\nvouchsafe. Forthwith he began the accumulation of materials, a task in\r\nwhich ten active years (A.D. 200 to 210) were utilized. The actual\r\nlabor of composition, continued for twelve years more at intervals of\r\nrespite from duties of state, brought him in his narrative to the\r\ninception of the reign of his original patron, the first Severus.--All\r\nthe foregoing facts are given us as Dio's own statement, in what is at\r\npresent the twenty-third chapter of the seventy-second book, by that\r\npainter in miniature, Ioannes Xiphilinus.\r\n\r\nIt was now the year A.D. 223, Dio was either consul for the first time\r\n(as some assert) or had the consular office behind him, the world was\r\nricher by the loss of Elagabalus, and Alexander Severus reigned in his\r\nstead. Under this emperor the remaining books (Seventy-three to\r\nEighty, inclusive) must have been composed, for Dio puts the finishing\r\ntouches on his history in 229. Since by that time he was nearly eighty\r\nyears of age and since he has written of no reign subsequent to\r\nAlexander's, we may conclude that he did not survive his master, who\r\ndied in 235. The sum total of his efforts, then, as he left it,\r\nconsisted of eighty books, covering a period from 1064 B.C. to 229\r\nA.D. At present there are extant of that number complete only Books\r\nThirty-six to Sixty inclusive, treating the events of the years 68\r\nB.C. to 47 A.D. The last twenty books, Sixty-one to Eighty, appear in\r\nfairly reliable excerpts and epitomes, but for the first thirty-five\r\nbooks we are dependent upon the merest scraps and fragments. How and\r\nby what steps this great work disintegrated, and in what form it has\r\nbeen preserved to modern times, this it is to be our next business to\r\ntrace.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Dio's work had no immediate influence, but \"Time brings\r\nroses\", and in the Byzantine age we find that he had come to be\r\nregarded as the canonical example of the way in which Roman History\r\nshould be written. Before this desirable result, however, had been\r\nbrought to pass, Books Twenty-two to Thirty-five inclusive had\r\ndisappeared. These gave the events of the years from the destruction\r\nof Carthage and Corinth (in the middle of the second century B.C.) to\r\nthe activity of Lucullus in 69. A like fate befell Books Seventy and\r\nSeventy-one at an early date. The first twenty-one books and the last\r\nforty-five (save the two above noted) seem to have been extant in\r\ntheir original forms at least as late as the twelfth century. Which\r\nend of the already syncopated composition was the first to go the way\r\nof all flesh (and parchment, too,) it would not be an easy matter to\r\ndetermine. It is regarded by most scholars as certain that Ioannes\r\nZonaras, who lived in the twelfth century, had the first twenty-one\r\nand the last forty-five for his epitomes. Hultsch, to be sure,\r\nadvances the opinion[1] that Books One to Twenty-one had by that time\r\nfallen into a condensed form, the only one accessible; but the\r\nmajority of scholars are against him. After Zonaras's day both One to\r\nTwenty-one and Sixty-one to Eighty suffer the corruption of moth and\r\nof worm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Iahni Annales, vol. 141, p. 290 sqq.]\r\n\r\nThe world has, then, in this twentieth century, those entire books of\r\nDio which have already been mentioned,--Thirty-six to Sixty,--and\r\nsomething more. Let us first consider, accordingly, the condition in\r\nwhich this intact remnant has come down to the immediate present, and\r\nafterward the sources on which we have to depend for a knowledge of\r\nthe lost portion.\r\n\r\nThere are eleven manuscripts for this torso of Roman History, taking\r\ntheir names from the library of final deposit, but they are not all,\r\nby any means, of equal value. First come Mediceus A (referred to in\r\nthis book as Ma), Vaticanus A, Parisinus A, and Venetus A (Va) of the\r\nfirst class; then Mediceus B of the second class; finally, Parisinus\r\nB, Escorialensis, Turinensis, Vaticanus B, and Venetus B, with the\r\nmongrel Vesontinus, which occupies a position in this group best\r\ndesignated, perhaps, as 2-1/2.\r\n\r\nVaticanus A has been copied from Mediceus A, and Parisinus A from\r\nVaticanus A, so that they are practically one with their archetype.\r\nVenetus A is of equal age and authority with Mediceus A. One can not\r\nnow get back of these two codices. There is none of remoter date for\r\nDio save the parchment Cod. Vat. 1288, containing most of Books\r\nSeventy-eight and Seventy-nine,--a portion of the work for the moment\r\nnot under discussion. Coming to the second class, Mediceus B is a\r\njoint product of copying from the two principal MSS. just mentioned.\r\nIn the third class, Parisinus B is a copy of Mediceus B with a little\r\nat the opening taken from Mediceus A. This was the version selected as\r\na guide by Robert Estienne in the first important edition of Dio ever\r\npublished (A.D. 1548). All the rest, Escorialensis, Turinensis,\r\nVaticanus B, and Venetus B are mere offshoots of Parisinus B. The\r\nVesontinus codex is derived partly from Venetus A and partly from some\r\nmanuscript of the third class.\r\n\r\nThe parchment manuscript to which allusion was made above is only some\r\nthree centuries later than the time of Dio himself. It covers the\r\nground from Book 78, 2, 2, to 79, 8, 3 inclusive (ordinary division).\r\nIt belonged to Orsini, and after his death (A.D. 1600) became the\r\nproperty of the Vatican Library. It is square in shape and consists of\r\nthirteen leaves, each containing three columns of uncials. In spite\r\nof its age it is fairly overflowing with errors of every sort, many of\r\nwhich have been emended by an unknown corrector who also wrote in\r\nuncials; this same corrector would appear to have added the last leaf.\r\nAnd there are a few additions in minuscules by a still later hand. The\r\nleaves are very thin and in some places the ink has completely faded,\r\nshowing only the impression of the pen. For specimen illustrations of\r\nthis codex see Silvestre (Paleographie Universelle II, plate 7),\r\nTischendorf (cod. Sinait. plate 20) and Boissevain's Cassius Dio (Vol.\r\nIII).\r\n\r\nThe dates of these codices (centuries indicated by Arabic numerals)\r\nare about as follows:\r\n\r\n         I. Mediceus A-Ma-          (11)\r\n         I. Venetus A-Va-           (11)\r\n         I. Vaticanus A             (15)\r\n         I. Parisinus A             (17)\r\n        II. Mediceus B              (15)\r\n       III. Parisinus B             (15)\r\n       III. Venetus B               (15)\r\n       III. Vaticanus B             (15)\r\nI. and III. Vesontinus              (15)\r\n       III. Turinensis              (16)\r\n       III. Escorialensis            (?)\r\nI. Codex Vaticanus graecus No. 1288 (5-6).\r\n\r\nMediceus A contains practically Books Thirty-six to Fifty-four, and\r\nVenetus A Books Forty-one to Sixty (two \"decades\"). As they are both\r\nthe oldest copies extant and the sources of all the others, modern\r\neditors would confine themselves to them exclusively but for the fact\r\nthat in each some gaps are found. In Mediceus A, for instance, two\r\nquaternions (sixteen leaves) are lacking at the start, Leaf 7 is gone\r\nfrom the third quaternion, Leaves 1 and 8 from the fourth; from the\r\nthirty-first (now Quaternion 29) Leaf 1 has been cut, from the\r\nthirty-third and last Leaf 5 has disappeared. Likewise in Venetus A\r\nthere are some gaps, especially near the end, in Book Sixty, where\r\nthree leaves are missing. Hence (without stopping to take up gaps and\r\nbreaks in detail) it may be said that the general plan pursued at the\r\npresent day is to adopt a reading drawn for each book from the\r\nfollowing sources respectively:\r\n\r\nBook 36.          Mediceus A, with lacuna of chapters\r\n                  3-19 incl., supplied by the\r\n                  mutual corrections of Vaticanus\r\n                  A and Parisinus B.\r\n\r\nBooks 37 to 49.   Mediceus A.\r\n\r\nBooks 50 to 54.   Vaticanus A (vice Mediceus A).\r\n\r\nBooks 55 to 59.   Venetus A.\r\n\r\nBook 60.          Venetus A, except chapter 17, sections\r\n                  7 to 20, and chapter 22,\r\n                  section 3, to chapter 26, section\r\n                  2,--two passages supplied by\r\n                  Mediceus B.\r\n\r\nWhat knowledge has the world of the first thirty-five books of Dio's\r\nRoman History? To such a question answer must be made that of this\r\nwhole section the merest glimpse can be had. It is here that we\r\nencounter the name of Zonaras, concerning whom some information will\r\nnow be in order. Ioannes Zonaras was an official of the Byzantine\r\nCourt who came into prominence under Alexis I. Comnenus in the early\r\npart of the twelfth century. For a time he acted as both commander of\r\nthe body-guard and first private secretary to Alexis, but in the\r\nsucceeding reign,--that of Calo-Ioannes,--he retired to the monastery\r\nof Mt. Athos, where he devoted himself to literary labors until his\r\ndeath, which is said to have occurred at the advanced age of\r\neighty-eight. He was the author of numerous works, such as a Lexicon\r\nof Words Old and New, an Exposition of the Apostolic and Patristic\r\nCanons, an Argument Directed Against the Marriage of Two Nephews to\r\nthe Same Woman, etc.; but our special interest lies in his [Greek:\r\nChronikon] (Chronicon), a history of the world in eighteen books, from\r\nthe creation to 1118 A.D.,--this last being the date of the demise of\r\nAlexis. The earlier portions of this work are drawn from Josephus; for\r\nRoman History he uses largely Cassius Dio; Plutarch, Eusebius, Appian\r\nalso figure. But it has already been stated that Books Twenty-two to\r\nThirty-five perished at an indefinitely early date; hence it follows\r\nthat Zonaras has only Books One to Twenty-one at hand to use for his\r\naccount of _early_ Rome; besides these he has later employed Books\r\nForty-four to Eighty. Consequently it is possible to get many of the\r\nfacts related to Dio, and in some cases his exact words, by reading\r\nBooks VII to XII of this [Greek: Chronikon] or [Greek: Epitome\r\nHistorion] by Zonaras. It is Books VII, VIII, and IX especially which\r\nfollow Books One to Twenty-one of Dio.\r\n\r\nParallel with this account of Zonaras and extending beyond it, even to\r\nthe extent of throwing a wire of communication across the yawning\r\ntime-chasm represented by Books Twenty-two to Thirty-five, are certain\r\nexcerpts and epitomes found in various odd corners and strangely\r\npreserved to the present moment. These are: Excerpts Concerning\r\nVirtues and Vices; Excerpts Concerning Judgments; Excerpts Concerning\r\nEmbassies. The so-called \"Planudean Excerpts\" which used to be\r\nadmitted to editions are rejected on good authority[2] by Melber, whom\r\nI have followed. I shall attempt only a brief mention of those\r\nexcerpts, to show their pertinence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mommsen (Hermes VI, pp. 82-89); Haupt (Hermes XIV, pp.\r\n36-64, and XV, p. 160); Boissevain (Program, Rotterdam, 1884).]\r\n\r\nThe _Excerpts Concerning Virtues and Vices_ exist in a manuscript of\r\nthe tenth century at the library of Tours, originally brought from the\r\nisland of Cyprus and sold to Nicolas Claude Fabre de Peiresc, who\r\nlived from 1580 to 1637. Apparently it is a collection made at the\r\norder of Constantine VII. Porphyrogenitus. It was first published at\r\nParis by Henri de Valois in 1634. The collection consists of\r\nquotations from Polybius, Diodorus Siculus, Nicolas Damascenus,\r\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, Appian, Dio, John of Antioch, and others.\r\n\r\nThe _Excerpts Concerning Judgments_ are found in a Vatican manuscript\r\nknown as Codex Vaticanus Rescriptus Graecus, N. 73. Angelo Mai first\r\npublished the collection at Rome in 1826. They consist of many\r\nnarrative fragments extending over the field of Roman History from\r\nearly to late times, but fall into two parts: between these two parts\r\nthere is a gap of six or more pages. That the former set of fragments\r\nis taken directly from Dio all scholars are ready to allow. In regard\r\nto the latter set there have been, and perhaps still are, diverse\r\nopinions. The trouble is that on the one hand these passages do not\r\nend with the reign of Alexander Severus, where Dio manifestly ended\r\nhis history, but continue down to Constantine and (since the\r\nmanuscript has lost some sheets at the close) possibly much farther:\r\nand on the other hand the style and diction differ considerably from\r\nDio's own. It was once the fashion to say that as many of the\r\nfragments as come before the reign of Valerian (A.D. 253)[3] came from\r\nDio's composition, but that the remainder were written by an unknown\r\nauthor. Now, however, it is generally agreed that all the excerpts of\r\nthe second set were the work of one man, whether John of Antioch, or\r\nPeter Patricius, or some third individual. Still, though not direct\r\nquotations from Dio, they are regarded as of value in filling out both\r\nhis account and that of Xiphilinus. The words are different, but the\r\nfacts remain undoubtedly true.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This would give Dio a considerably longer life than is\r\ncommonly allowed him.]\r\n\r\nThe _Excerpts Concerning Embassies_ are contained in somewhat less\r\nthan a dozen manuscripts, all of which prove to have sprung from a\r\nSpanish archetype (since destroyed by fire) that Juan Paez de Castro\r\nowned in the sixteenth century. Many of the copies were made by\r\nAndreas Darmarius. The first publisher of these selections was Fulvio\r\nOrsini (= Ursinus), who brought them out at Antwerp in 1582. As their\r\nname indicates, they are accounts of embassies sent either by the\r\nRomans to foreign tribes or by foreign tribes to the Romans. Some of\r\nthem are taken from Cassius Dio; hence their importance here.\r\n\r\nNow it was the custom of the earlier editors to arrange the (early)\r\nfragments of Dio according to the groups from which they were taken:\r\n(1) the so-called Fragmenta Valesia (pickings from grammarians,\r\nlexicographers, scholiasts), edited by the same Henri de Valois above\r\nmentioned; (2) the Fragmenta Peiresciana (= Excerpts Concerning\r\nVirtues and Vices); (3) the Fragmenta Ursina (= Excerpts Concerning\r\nEmbassies); and finally, in the edition of Sturz[4] (4) Excerpta\r\nVaticana (= Excerpts Concerning Judgments and the now rejected\r\n\"Planudean Excerpts\"). The above grouping has been abandoned and a\r\nstrictly chronological order followed in all the later editions,\r\nincluding Bekker, Dindorf, Melber, Boissevain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See p. 22.]\r\n\r\nThe body of Fragments preceding Book Thirty-six cites, in addition to\r\nthe collections mentioned, the following works or authors:\r\n\r\nAnecdota Graeca of Immanuel Bekker (1785-1871), a scholar of vast\r\nattainments and profound learning in classical literature. These\r\nAnecdota are excerpts made from various Greek manuscripts found in the\r\ncourse of travels extending through France, Italy, England, and\r\nGermany. There were three volumes, appearing from 1814 to 1821.\r\n\r\nAntonio Melissa.--A Greek monk living between 700 and 1100 A.D. He\r\ncollected two books of quotations from early Christian Fathers (one\r\nhundred and seventy-six titles) on the general subject of Virtues and\r\nVices.\r\n\r\nArsenius.--Archbishop of Monembasia: age of the Revival of Learning.\r\n\r\nCedrenus.--A Greek monk of the eleventh century who compiled a\r\nhistorical work ([Greek: Synopsis historion]) the scope of which\r\nextended from the creation to 1057 A.D. He gives no evidence of\r\nhistorical knowledge or the critical sense, but rather of great\r\ncredulity and a fondness for legends. His treatise is, moreover,\r\nlargely plagiarized from the _Annals_ of Ioannes Scylitzes\r\nCuropalates.\r\n\r\nCramer, J.A.--An Oxford scholar who published two collections of\r\nexcerpts (similar to those of Bekker) between 1835 and 1841. The\r\ncollection referred to in our text had its source in manuscripts of\r\nthe Royal Library in Paris. It was in three octavo volumes.\r\n\r\nEtymologicum Magnum.--A lexicon of uncertain date, after Photius (886\r\nA.D.) and before Eustathius. This dictionary contains many valuable\r\ncitations from lost Greek works. First edition, Venice, 1499.\r\n\r\nEustathius.--Archbishop of Thessalonica and the most learned man of\r\nhis age (latter half of the twelfth century). His most important\r\ncomposition is his _Commentary on Homer's Iliad and Odyssey_ in which\r\nhe quotes vast numbers of authors unknown to us now except by name.\r\nFirst edition, Rome, 1542-1550.\r\n\r\nGlossary of C. Labbaeus, the editor of Ancient Glosses of Law Terms,\r\npublished in Paris, 1606.\r\n\r\nJohn of Antioch.--Author of a work called \"Chronological History from\r\nAdam\" quoted in the _Excerpts Concerning Virtues and Vices_ (vid.\r\nsupra). Internal evidence indicates that the book was written after\r\n610 and before 900 A.D.\r\n\r\nJohn of Damascus.--A voluminous ecclesiastical writer belonging to the\r\nreigns of Leo Isauricus and Constantine VII. (approximately from 700\r\nto 750 A.D.). He was an opponent of the iconoclastic movement. The\r\nbest edition of his works was published at Paris in 1712. The passage\r\ncited in our Fragments is from [Greek: peri Drakonton], a mutilated\r\nessay on dragons standing between a \"Dialogue Between a Saracen and a\r\nChristian\" and a \"Discussion of the Holy Trinity.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Laurentius Lydus.--A Byzantine writer, born at Philadelphia (the\r\ncity of Revelation, III, 7), in 490 A.D. Although he was famed during\r\nhis lifetime as a poet, all his verses have perished. The work cited\r\nin our Fragments,--\"Concerning the Offices of the Roman Republic, in\r\nThree Books,\"--had a curious history. For centuries it was regarded as\r\nlost, but about 1785 nine tenths of it was discovered by De Villoison\r\nin a MS. in the suburbs of Constantinople. It was published in Paris,\r\n1811.--Laurentius in the course of his career held important political\r\nposts and received two important literary appointments from the\r\nEmperor Justinian I.\r\n\r\nSuidas.--A lexicographer of the tenth century, composer of the most\r\ncomprehensive Greek dictionary of early times. It is a manual at once\r\nof language and of antiquities. Inestimable as its value is, the\r\nworkmanship is careless and uneven. The arrangement is alphabetical.\r\n\r\nJohn Tzetzes.--A Greek grammarian of the twelfth century. His learning\r\nwas great but scarcely equaled his self-conceit, as repeatedly\r\ndisplayed in passages of his works. Many of his writings are still\r\nextant. One of these is called _Chiliades_ (or _Thousands_), a name\r\nbestowed by its first editor, who divided the work into sections of\r\none thousand lines each. The subject-matter consists of the most\r\nmiscellaneous historical or mythological narratives or anecdotes,\r\nabsolutely without connection. Tzetzes copied these accounts from\r\nupward of four hundred writers,--one of them being Cassius Dio. The\r\n_Chiliades_ is written in the so-called _Versus politicus_, or\r\n\"political verse,\" which is really not verse at all, but a kind of\r\ndecadent doggerel.--A minor treatise by the same author is the\r\n_Exegesis of the Iliad of Homer_, published by Hermann (Leipzig,\r\n1812).\r\n\r\nIsaac Tzetzes, who has attracted less attention than his brother John,\r\nis best known as the author of a commentary on the _Cassandra_ of\r\nLycophron (a poem of 1474 iambic verses by a post-classical tragedian,\r\nabout 285 B.C., embodying the warnings of the royal prophetess and\r\ncouched in appropriately incomprehensible expressions). It was hardly\r\nworth all the care that Tzetzes lavished upon it. From manuscript\r\nevidence and various claims of John Tzetzes it seems that John worked\r\nover, improved, and enlarged the commentary of his brother. Isaac's\r\nname, however, still remains associated with this particular\r\nexposition.\r\n\r\nWe are now at length placed in a position to consider the condition\r\nof the ultimate portion of the work, i.e., the last twenty books,\r\nSixty-one to Eighty inclusive. In general it may be said that for this\r\nsection of the history we are thrown back upon an epitome of Ioannes\r\nXiphilinus, who lived about fifty years earlier than the Ioannes\r\nZonaras recently under discussion. To this general statement there are\r\ntwo important exceptions. First, even as early as Xiphilinus wrote\r\n(eleventh century) nearly two books of this last portion had perished.\r\nBook Seventy, containing the reign of Antoninus Pius, was entirely\r\ngone save a few miserable chapters, and Book Seventy-one had suffered\r\nthe same fate in its beginning, so that our account of the renowned\r\nMarcus Aurelius begins practically with the year 172 instead of 161.\r\nThe gap thus created has been partially filled by extracts of every\r\nconceivable quality and merit, from Suidas, from John of Antioch, even\r\nfrom Asinius Quadratus. This on the side of loss: on the side of gain\r\nthere are numerous little excerpts (just as in the case of the early\r\nbooks) that may serve to fill crevices or cover scars, and above all\r\nthere exists a parchment manuscript, known as Vaticanus 1288, older\r\nthan Mediceus A, older than Venetus A, and containing Books\r\nSeventy-eight and Seventy-nine probably very much as Dio wrote them,\r\nsave that the account is mutilated at beginning and end.\r\n\r\nBoissevain concludes (by comparing the Table of Contents found with a\r\nremark of Photius) that this particular piece of salvage was\r\noriginally Books Seventy-nine and Eighty (instead of Seventy-eight and\r\nSeventy-nine), that Book Eighty of Dio was really what is now\r\ncommonly called Seventy-nine _and_ Eighty, and that the so-called Book\r\nEighty (of only five chapters) was but a kind of epilogue to the whole\r\nwork. Whatever we may decide respecting the merits of his argument,\r\nthe important fact is that here for a short distance we have Dio's\r\noriginal narrative, as in Books Thirty-six to Sixty, and are no longer\r\nobliged to depend upon epitomes.\r\n\r\nA word of explanation about Xiphilinus must come next. This Xiphilinus\r\nwas a native of Trapezos (Trebizond) and became a monk at\r\nConstantinople. Here, at the behest of Michael VII. Ducas (1071-1078)\r\nhe made an abridgment of Books Thirty-six to Eighty of Dio; thus it is\r\nhis version of the lost books Sixty-one to Eighty on which we are\r\ncompelled to rely. His task was accomplished with an even greater\r\ndegree of carelessness than is customary in such compositions, and it\r\nmay be said that his ability or, at least, his good will is not nearly\r\nso great as that of Zonaras. Yet he is largely a _pis aller_ for the\r\nwould-be reader of Cassius Dio.\r\n\r\nWhereas the original was divided arbitrarily into books, Xiphilinus\r\ndivided his condensation into \"sections,\" each containing the life of\r\none emperor. Readers must further note that the present division of\r\nBooks Seventy-one to Eighty dates only from Leunclavius (1592, first\r\nedition) and is not necessarily correct. Improvements in arrangement\r\nby Boissevain (latest editor of Dio entire) are indicated in the\r\npresent translation, though for convenience of reference the old\r\nheadlines are still retained.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the editions through which Dio's _Roman History_\r\nhas passed it seems desirable to summarize briefly the condition of\r\nthe whole as explained in the preceding pages. Here is a bird's-eye\r\nview of the whole situation.\r\n\r\nBooks  1-21 exist in Zonaras and various fragments.\r\n  \"   22-35 exist in fragments only.\r\n  \"   36-54 exist in Dio's own words, and are\r\n              found in universally approved MSS.\r\n  \"   54-60 exist in generally approved MSS.\r\n  \"   60-69 exist in Xiphilinus and excerpts.\r\nBook     70 exists in fragments only.\r\nBooks 71-77 exist in Xiphilinus and excerpts.\r\n  \"  78, 79 exist in Dio's own words (oldest MS).\r\nBook     80 exists in Xiphilinus.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITIONS.\r\n\r\nA brief list of important editions of this author is appended; the\r\norder is chronological.\r\n\r\n1.

Ten\r\nvolumes. Gros edited the first four; Boissee the last six. Paris,\r\n1845-1870.\r\n\r\n17. Dindorf.--Teubner text. Dindorf was the first to perceive the\r\nrelation of the manuscripts and their respective values. He used\r\nHerwerden's new collation of the Vatican palimpsest containing\r\n_Excerpts Concerning Judgments_. From making fuller notes and\r\nemendations he was prevented by untimely death. Five volumes. Leipzig,\r\n1863-1865.\r\n\r\n18. Melber.--Teubner text, being a new recension of Dindorf, with\r\nnumerous additions. To consist of five volumes. Leipzig, from 1890.\r\nThe first two volumes, all that were available, have been used for\r\nthis translation.\r\n\r\n19. Boissevain.--The most modern, accurate, and artistic edition of\r\nDio. The editor is very conservative in the matter of manuscript\r\ntradition. He personally read in Italy many of the MSS., and had the\r\naid of numerous friends at home and abroad in collating MSS., besides\r\nthe help of a few in the suggestion of new readings. In the later\r\nportion of the text he makes a new division of books, and essays also\r\nto assign the early fragments to their respective books. Three\r\nvolumes. Berlin, 1895, 1898, 1901. Vol. I, pp. 359 + cxxvi; Vol. II,\r\npp. 690 + xxxi; Vol. III, pp. 800 + xviii. The second volume contains\r\ntwo phototype facsimiles of pages of the Laurentian and Marcian MSS.,\r\nand the third volume three similar specimens of the Codex Vaticanus.\r\nIn the appendix of the last volume are found, in the order named, the\r\nfollowing aids to the study of Dio.\r\n\r\n     1. The _entire_ epitome of Xiphilinus (Books 36-80).\r\n\r\n     2. Vatican Excerpts of Peter Patricius (Nos. 1-38), compared\r\n     with Dio's wording.\r\n\r\n     3. Vatican Excerpts of Peter Patricius (Nos. 156-191),\r\n     containing that portion of the Historia Augusta which is\r\n     subsequent to Dio's narrative.\r\n\r\n     4. Excerpts by John of Antioch, taken from Dio.\r\n\r\n     5. The \"Salmasian Excerpts.\"\r\n\r\n     6. Some \"Constantinian Excerpts,\" compared with Dio.\r\n\r\n     7. The account of Dio given by Photius and by Suidas.\r\n\r\n     8. Table of Fragments.\r\n\r\nBoissevain's invaluable emendations and interpretations have been\r\nliberally used by the present translator, and some of his changes of\r\narrangement have been accepted outright, others only indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF THE NARRATIVE.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Dio's Roman History is serious to a degree. Its\r\nauthor never loses sight of the fact that by his labor he is\r\nconferring a substantial benefit upon mankind, and he follows,\r\nmoreover, a particular historical theory, popular at the time, which\r\nallows little chance for sportiveness or wit. Just as the early French\r\ndrama could concern itself only with personages of noble or royal\r\nrank, so Dio's ideal compels him for the most part to restrict himself\r\nto the large transactions of governments or rulers and to diminish the\r\nconsideration that idiosyncrasies of private life or points of\r\nantiquarian interest might otherwise seem to claim. The name of this\r\nideal is \"Dignity\" ([Greek: onkos] is the Greek), a principle of\r\nconstruction which is opposed to a narration adorned with details.\r\nHowever much it may have been overworked at times, its influence was\r\ncertainly healthful, for it demanded that the material be handled in\r\norganic masses to prevent the reader from being lost in a confused\r\nmass of minutiae. Racy gossip and old wives' tales are to be replaced\r\nby philosophic reflection and pictures of temperament. Instead of mere\r\nlists of anecdotes there must be a careful survey of political\r\nrelations. Names, numbers, and exact dates may often be dispensed\r\nwith. Still, amid all this, there is enough humor of situation in the\r\ngigantic tale and enough latitude of speech on the part of the acting\r\npersonages to prevent monotony and to render intellectual\r\nscintillations of the compiler comparatively unnecessary.\r\nOccasionally, for the sake of sharper focus on the portrait of some\r\nleader, Dio will introduce this or that trivial incident and may\r\nperhaps feel called upon immediately, under the strictness of his\r\nself-imposed regime, to apologize or justify himself.\r\n\r\nThe style of the original is rendered somewhat difficult by a\r\nconscious imitation of the involved sentence-unit found in Thukydides\r\n(though reminiscences of Herodotos and Demosthenes also abound) but\r\ngives an effect of solidity that is symmetrical with both the method\r\nand the man. Moreover, one may assert of it what Matthew Arnold\r\ndeclared could _not_ be said regarding Homer's style, that it rises\r\nand falls with the matter it treats, so that at every climax we may be\r\nsure of finding the charm of vividness and at many intermediate points\r\nthe merit of grace. It is a long course that our historian, pressed by\r\nofficial cares, has to cover, and he accomplishes his difficult task\r\nwith creditable zeal: finally, when his Thousand Years of Rome is\r\ndone, he compares himself to a warrior helped by a protecting deity\r\nfrom the scene of conflict. Surely it must have been one of the major\r\nbattles of his energetic life to wrest from the formless void this\r\norderly record of actions and events embroidered with discussion of\r\nthe motives for those actions and the causes of such events.\r\n\r\nDio has apparently equipped himself extremely well for his\r\nundertaking. A fragment edited by Mai (see Fragment I) seems to make\r\nhim say that he has read every available book upon the subject; and,\r\nlike Thukydides, he is critical, he is eclectic, and often supports\r\nhis statements by the citation or introduction of documentary\r\ntestimony. His superstition is debasing and repellent, but works harm\r\nonly in limited spheres, and it is counterbalanced by the fact that he\r\nhad been a part of many events recounted and had held high\r\ngovernmental offices, enjoying a career which furnished him with\r\nstandards by which to judge the likelihood of allegations regarding\r\nearlier periods of Rome,--that, in a word, he was no mere\r\ncarpet-knight of History. He is honestly conscientious in his use of\r\nlanguage, attempting to give the preference to standard phrases and\r\nwords of classical Greek over corrupt idioms and expressions of a\r\ndecadent tongue; it is this very conscientiousness, of course, which\r\nleads him to adopt so much elaborate syntax from bygone masters of\r\nstyle. Finally,--the point in which, I think, Dio has come nearest to\r\nthe gloomy Athenian,--something of the matter-of-fact directness of\r\nThukydides is perceptible in this Roman History. The operator unrolls\r\nbefore us the long panorama of wars and plots and bribes and murders:\r\nhis pictures speak, but he himself seldom interjects a word. Sometimes\r\nthe lack of comment seems almost brutal, but what need to darken the\r\ntorture-chamber in the House of Hades?\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of writing history. One is to observe a strictly\r\nchronological order, describing together only such events as took\r\nplace in a single year or reign; and the other, to give all in one\r\nplace and in one narration the story of a single great movement,\r\nthough it should cover several years and a fraction,--or, again, to\r\nsketch the condition of affairs in one province, or valley, or\r\npeninsula for so long a time as the story of such a region seems to\r\npossess unity of development. The first kind of writing takes the year\r\nor the reign as its standard, whereas the second uses the matter under\r\ndiscussion or some part of the earth in the same way: and they may\r\naccordingly be called, one, the chronological method, and the other,\r\nthe pragmato-geographical. The difference between the two is well\r\nillustrated by the varying ways in which modern works on Greek history\r\ntreat the affairs of Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe first plan is that which Dio follows, and his work would have been\r\ncalled by the Romans _annales_ rather than _historiae_. The method has\r\nits advantages, one of which is, or should be, that the reader knows\r\njust how far he has progressed; he can compare the relative\r\nsignificance of events happening at the same time in widely separated\r\nlands: he is, as it were, _living_ in the past, and receives from week\r\nto week or month to month reports of the world's doings in all\r\nquarters. On the other hand, this plan lacks dramatic force; there are\r\nsub-climaces and one grand climax: and the interest is apt to flag\r\nthrough being obliged to divide itself among many districts. The same\r\nresults, both good and bad, are observable in Thukydides, whom Dio\r\nfollows in constructive theory as well as style. It has already been\r\nsaid that our historian sacrifices sharpness of dates to the Onkos,\r\ndepending, doubtless, on his chronological arrangements to make good\r\nthe loss. Usually it does so, but occasionally confusion arises.\r\nWhether because he noticed this or not, he begins at the opening of\r\nthe fifty-first book to be accurate in his dates, generally stating\r\nthe exact day. Rarely, Dio lets his interest run away with him and\r\nmixes the two economies.\r\n\r\nIf we read the pages closely, we find that by Dio's own statement his\r\nwork falls properly into three parts. The first consists of the first\r\nfifty-one books, from the landing of AEneas to the establishment of the\r\nempire by Octavianus. Up to that time, Dio says (in LIII, 19),\r\npolitical action had been taken openly, after discussion in the senate\r\nand before the people. Everybody knew the facts, and in case any\r\nauthors distorted them, the public records were open for any one to\r\nconsult. After that time, however, the rulers commonly kept their acts\r\nand discussions secret; and their censored accounts, when made public,\r\nwere naturally looked upon by the man in the street with doubt and\r\nsuspicion. Hence, from this point, says the historian, a radical\r\ndifference must inevitably be found in the character of his account.\r\n\r\nThe second portion, opening with Book Fifty-two, ends at the death of\r\nMarcus Aurelius (180 B.C.). In LXXI, 36, 4 Dio admits that the old\r\nsplendor ended with Marcus and was not renewed. His history, he says,\r\nmakes here a sheer descent ([Greek: katapiptei]) from the golden to\r\nthe iron age. It fades, as it were, into the light of common day in a\r\ndouble sense: for the events succeeding this reign Dio himself was\r\nable to observe as an intelligent eyewitness.\r\n\r\nThe third section, then, extends from the beginning of Book\r\nSeventy-two to the end of the work. Here Dio breaks away oftener than\r\nbefore from his servility to the Dignity of History, only to display a\r\nfar more contemptible servility to his imperial masters. According to\r\nhis own account he stood by and passively allowed atrocities to be\r\nmultiplied about him, nor does he venture to express any forceful\r\nindignation at the performance of such deeds. Had he protested, the\r\nworld's knowledge of Rome's degenerate tyrants would undoubtedly have\r\nbeen less complete than it now is; and Dio was quite enough of an\r\negotist to believe that his own life and work were of paramount\r\nimportance. If we compare him unfavorably with Epictetus, we must\r\nremember that the latter was obscure enough to be ignored.\r\n\r\nIn both the second and the third parts, that is to say throughout the\r\nentire imperial period, Dio is conceded to have committed an error in\r\nhis point of view by making the relations of the emperor to the senate\r\nthe leading idea in his narrative and subordinating other events to\r\nthat relation. Senator as he was, he naturally magnified its\r\nimportance, and in an impartial estimate of his account one must allow\r\nfor personal bias.\r\n\r\nOur historian's sources for the earlier part of his work are not\r\npositively known. He has been credited with the use of Livy, of\r\nCoelius, of Appian, and of Dionysios of Halicarnassos, but the\r\ntraces are not definite enough to warrant any dogmatic assertion.\r\nPerhaps he knew Tacitus and perhaps Suetonius: the portrait of\r\nTiberius is especially good and was probably obtained from an author\r\nof merit. But there were in existence a great multitude of books\r\ninferior or now forgotten besides the works of the authors above\r\nmentioned; and Dio's History in general shows no greater evidence of\r\nhaving been drawn from writers whom we know than from others whom we\r\ndo not know.\r\n\r\nWe have already noticed Dio's similarity to Thukydides in style,\r\narrangement, and emotional attitude. There remains one more bond of\r\nbrotherhood,--the speeches. Just as the sombre story of the\r\nPeloponnesian conflict has for a prominent feature the pleas and\r\ncounterpleas of contending parties, together with a few independent\r\norations, so this Roman History is filled with public utterances of\r\nfamous men, either singly or in pairs. Dio evinces considerable\r\nfondness for these wordy combats ([Greek: hamillai logon]). About one\r\nspeech to the book is the average in the earlier portion of the work.\r\nThe author probably adapted them from rhetorical [Greek: meletai], or\r\nessays, then in existence. He was himself a finished product of the\r\nrhetorical schools and was inclined to give their output the greatest\r\npublicity. The most interesting of these efforts,--some go so far as\r\nto say the only one of real interest,--is the speech of Maecenas in\r\nfavor of the establishment of monarchy by Augustus: this argument\r\nundoubtedly sets forth Dio's own views on government. Like the rival\r\ndeliverance of Agrippa it shows traces of having undergone a revision\r\nof the first draught, and it is more than probable that the two did\r\nnot assume their present shape until the time of Alexander Severus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.--THE WRITER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuidas, the lexicographer of the tenth century, who is profitable for\r\nso many things, has this entry under \"Dio\":\r\n\r\n     Dio--called Cassius, surnamed Cocceius (others\r\n     \"Cocceianus\"), of Nicaea, historian, born in the times of\r\n     Alexander son of Mammaea, wrote a Roman History in 80 books\r\n     (they are divided by decades), a \"Persia\", \"The Getae\",\r\n     \"Journey-signs\", \"In Trajan's Day\", \"Life of Arrian the\r\n     Philosopher\".\r\n\r\nPhotius, an influential Patriarch of Constantinople and belonging to\r\nthe ninth century, has in his \"Bibliotheca\" a much longer notice,\r\nwhich, however, contains almost nothing that a reader will not find in\r\nDio's own record. This is about the extent of the information afforded\r\nus by antiquity, and modern biographers usually fall back upon the\r\nauthor's own remarks regarding himself, as found scattered through his\r\nRoman History. Such personal references were for the first time\r\ncarefully collected, systematically arranged, and discussed in the\r\nedition of Reimar; subsequently the same matter was reprinted in the\r\nfifth volume of the Dindorf Teubner text.\r\n\r\nJust a word first in regard to the lost works with which Suidas\r\ncredits Dio. He probably never wrote the \"Persia\": perhaps it belonged\r\nto Dio of Colophon, or possibly Suidas has confused _Dion_ with\r\n_Deinon_. It is certain that he did not write \"The Getae\": this\r\ncomposition was by his maternal grandfather, Dio of Prusa, and was the\r\nfruit of exile. \"Journey-signs\" or \"Itineraries\" is an enigmatic\r\ntitle, and the more cautious scholars forbear to venture an opinion\r\nupon its significance. Bernhardy, editor of Suidas, says \"Intelligo\r\n_Librum de Signis_\" and translates the title \"De Ominibus inter\r\ncongrediendum.\" Leonhard Schmitz (in the rather antiquated _Smith_)\r\nthinks it means \"Itineraries\" and that Dio Chrysostom very likely\r\nwrote it, because he traveled considerably. Concerning \"In Trajan's\r\nDay\" two opinions may be mentioned,--one, that the attribution of such\r\na title to Dio is a mistake (for, if true, he would have mentioned it\r\nin his larger work): the other, that its substance was incorporated\r\nin the larger work, and that it thereby lost its identity and\r\nimportance. The \"Life of Arrian\" is probably a fact. Arrian was a\r\nfellow-countryman of Dio's and had a somewhat similar character and\r\ncareer. It may be true, as Christ surmises, that this biography was a\r\nyouthful task or an essay of leisure, hastily thrown off in the midst\r\nof other enterprises.\r\n\r\nComing to Dio's personality we have at the outset to decide how his\r\nname shall be written. We must make sure of his proper designation\r\nbefore we presume to talk about him. The choice lies between Dio\r\nCassius and Cassius Dio, and the former is the popular form of the\r\nname, if it be permissible to speak of Dio at all as a \"popular\"\r\nwriter. The facts in the case, however, are simple. The Greek\r\narrangement is [Greek: Dion ho Kassios]. Now the regular Greek custom\r\nis to place the gentile name, or even the praenomen, _after_ the\r\ncognomen: but the regular Latin custom (and after all Dio has more of\r\nthe Roman in his makeup than of the Greek) is to observe the order\r\n_praenomen_, _nomen_, _cognomen_. It is objected, first, that the\r\nGreeks _sometimes_ followed the regular Latin order, and, second, that\r\nthe Romans _sometimes_ followed the regular Greek order (e.g., Cicero,\r\nin his _Letters_). But the Greek exception cannot here make Dio the\r\n_nomen_ and Cassius the _cognomen_: we _know_ that the historian\r\nbelonged to the gens Cassia (his father was Cassius Apronianus) and\r\nthat he took Dio as cognomen from his grandfather, Dio Chrysostom. And\r\nthe Latin exception simply offers us the alternative of following a\r\ncommon usage or an uncommon usage. The real question is whether Dio\r\nshould be regarded rather as Greek or as Roman. To be logical, we must\r\nsay either Dion Kassios or Cassius Dio. Considering the historian's\r\ntimes and his _habitat_, not merely his birthplace and literary\r\ndialect, I must prefer Cassius Dio as his official appellation. Yet,\r\nbecause the opposite arrangement has the sanction of usage, I deem it\r\ndesirable to employ as often as possible the unvexed single name\r\n_Dio_.\r\n\r\nDio's praenomen is unknown, but he had still another cognomen,\r\nCocceianus, which he derived along with the _Dio_ from his maternal\r\ngrandfather. The latter, known as Dio of Prusa from his birthplace in\r\nBithynia, is renowned for his speeches, which contain perhaps more\r\nphilosophy than oratory and won for him from posterity the title of\r\nChrysostom,--\"Golden Mouth.\" Dio of Prusa was exiled by the tyrant\r\nDomitian, but recalled and showered with favors by the emperor\r\nCocceius Nerva (96-98 A.D.); from this patron he took the cognomen\r\nmentioned, Cocceianus, which he handed down to his illustrious\r\ngrandson.\r\n\r\nBesides this distinguished ancestor on his mother's side Dio the\r\nhistorian had a father, Cassius Apronianus, of no mean importance. He\r\nwas a Roman senator and had been governor of Dalmatia and Cilicia; to\r\nthe latter post Dio bore his father company (Books 49, 36; 69, 1; 72,\r\n7). The date of the historian's birth is determined approximately as\r\nsomewhere from 150 to 162 A.D., that is, during the last part of the\r\nreign of Antoninus Pius or at the beginning of the reign of Marcus\r\nAurelius. The town where he first saw the light was Nicaea in Bithynia.\r\n\r\nThe careful education which the youth must have had is evident, of\r\ncourse, in his work. After the trip to Cilicia already referred to Dio\r\ncame to Rome, probably not for the first time, arriving there early in\r\nthe reign of Commodus (Book 72, 4). This monster was overthrown in 192\r\nA.D.; before his death Dio was a senator (Book 72, 16): in other\r\nwords, he was by that time above the minimum age, twenty-five years,\r\nrequired for admission to full senatorial standing; and thus we gain\r\nsome scanty light respecting the date of his birth. Under Commodus he\r\nhad held no higher offices than those of quaestor and aedile: Pertinax\r\nnow, in the year 193, made him praetor (Book 73, 12). Directly came the\r\ndeath of Pertinax, as likewise of his successor Julianus, and the\r\naccession of him whom Dio proudly hailed as the \"Second\r\nAugustus,\"--Septimius Severus. The new emperor exerted a great\r\ninfluence upon Dio's political views. He pretended that the gods had\r\nbrought him forward, as they had Augustus, especially for his work.\r\nThe proofs of Heaven's graciousness to this latest sovereign were\r\nprobably by him delivered to Dio, who undertook to compile them into a\r\nlittle book and appears to have believed them all; Severus, indeed,\r\nhad been remarkably successful at the outset. Before long Dio had\r\nbegun his great work, which he doubtless intended to bring to a\r\ntriumphant conclusion amid the golden years of the new prince of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the _entente cordiale_ between ruler and historian did\r\nnot long endure. Severus grew disappointing to Dio through his\r\nseverity, visited first upon Niger and later upon Caesar Clodius\r\nAlbinus: and Dio came to be _persona non grata_ to Severus for this\r\nreason among others, that the emperor changed his mind completely\r\nabout Commodus, and since he had begun to revere, if not to imitate\r\nhim, what Dio had written concerning his predecessor could be no\r\nlonger palatable. The estrangement seems to be marked by the fact that\r\nuntil Severus's death Dio went abroad on no important military or\r\ndiplomatic mission, but remained constantly in Italy. He was sometimes\r\nin Rome, but more commonly resided at his country-seat in Capua (Book\r\n76, 2). In a very vague Passage in Book 76, 16 Dio speaks of finding\r\n\"when I was consul\" three thousand indictments for adultery inscribed\r\non the records. This leads most scholars to assume that he was consul\r\n_before_ the death of Severus. Reimar thought differently, and\r\nproduces arguments to support his view. I do not deem many of the\r\npassages which he cites entirely apposite, and yet some of the points\r\nurged are important. I can only say that the impression left in my\r\nmind by a rapid reading of the Greek is that Dio was consul while\r\nSeverus reigned; if such be the case, he probably held the rank of\r\n_consul suffectus_ (\"honorary\" or \"substitute\"). All who refuse to\r\nadmit that he could have obtained so high an office at that time place\r\nthe date of his first consulship anywhere from 219 to 223 A.D. because\r\nof his own statement that in 224 he was appointed to the (regularly\r\nproconsular) governorship of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe son of Severus, Caracalla or Antoninus, drew Dio from his\r\nhomekeeping and took him with him on an eastern expedition in 216, so\r\nthat our historian passed the winter of 216-217 as a member of\r\nCaracalla's retinue at Nicomedea (Book 77, 17 and 18) and joined there\r\nin the annual celebration of the Saturnalia (Book 78, 8). Dio takes\r\noccasion to deplore the emperor's bestial behavior as well as the\r\nconsiderable pecuniary outlay to which he was personally subjected,\r\nbut at the same time he evidently did not allow his convictions to\r\nbecome indiscreetly audible. Much farther than Nicomedea Dio cannot\r\nhave accompanied his master; for he did not go to the Parthian war,\r\npresently undertaken, and he was not present either at Caracalla's\r\ndeath (217) or at the overthrow of Macrinus (218). This Macrinus, one\r\nof the short-time emperors, gave Dio the post of _curator ad\r\ncorrigendum statum civitatium_, with administrative powers over the\r\ncities of Pergamum and Smyrna (Book 79, 7), and his appointee remained\r\nin active service during much of the reign of Elagabalus,--possibly,\r\nindeed, until the accession of Alexander Severus (see Book 78, 18,\r\nend). Mammaea, the mother of the new sovereign, surrounded her son with\r\nskilled helpers of proved value, and it was possibly due to her wisdom\r\nthat Dio was first sent to manage the proconsulate of Africa, and, on\r\nhis return, to govern the imperial provinces of Dalmatia and Upper\r\nPannonia. Somewhat later, in the year 229, he became consul for the\r\nsecond time, _consul ordinarius_, as colleague of Alexander himself.\r\nBut Dio's disciplinary measures in Pannonia had rendered him unpopular\r\nwith the pampered Pretorians, and heeding at once his own safety and\r\nthe emperor's request he remained most of the time outside of Rome.\r\nThis state of affairs was not wholly satisfactory, and it is not\r\nsurprising that after a short time Dio complained of a bad foot and\r\nasked leave to betake himself to Nicaea, his native place.\r\n\r\nHere we must leave him. Whether his death came soon or late after 229\r\nA.D. is a matter of some uncertainty. It would be difficult to make a\r\nmore complete record out of the available material, save to say that\r\nfrom two casual references it is inferred that Dio had a wife and\r\nchildren, and that in his career he often, sometimes with imperial\r\nassistance, tried cases in court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIST OF THE MORE RECENT DISSERTATIONS\r\n\r\nON\r\n\r\nCASSIUS DIO.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

He came ashore at Laurentum, by the mouth of the\r\nriver Numicius, where in obedience to some oracle he is said to have\r\nmade preparations to dwell.\r\n\r\nThe ruler of the land, Latinus, interfered with AEneas's settling in\r\nthe land, but after a sharp struggle was defeated. Then in accordance\r\nwith dreams that appeared to both leaders they effected a\r\nreconciliation and the king beside permitting AEneas to reside there\r\ngave him his daughter Lavinia in marriage. Thereupon AEneas founded a\r\ncity which he named Lavinium and the country was called Latium and the\r\npeople there were termed Latins. But the Rutuli who occupied adjoining\r\nterritory had been previously hostile to the Latins, and now they set\r\nout from the city of Ardea with warlike demonstrations. They had the\r\nsupport of no less distinguished a man than Turnus, a relative of\r\nLatinus, who had taken a dislike to Latinus because of Lavinia's\r\nmarriage, for it was to him that the maiden had originally been\r\npromised. A battle took place, Turnus and Latinus fell, and AEneas\r\ngained the victory and his father-in-law's kingdom as well. After a\r\ntime, however, the Rutuli secured the Etruscans as allies and marched\r\nupon AEneas. They won in this war. AEneas vanished, being seen no more\r\nalive or dead, and was honored as a god by the Latins. Hence he has\r\ncome to be regarded by the Romans as the fountain head of their race\r\nand they take pride in being called \"Sons of AEneas.\" The Latin domain\r\nfell in direct succession to his son Ascanius who had accompanied his\r\nfather from home. AEneas had not yet had any child by Lavinia, but left\r\nher pregnant. Ascanius was enclosed round about by the enemy, but by\r\nnight the Latins attacked them and ended both the siege and the war.\r\n\r\nAs time went on the Latin nation increased in size, and the majority\r\nof the people abandoned Lavinium to build another town in a better\r\nlocation. To it they gave the name of Alba from its whiteness and from\r\nits length they called it Longa (or, as Greeks would say, \"white\" and\r\n\"long\").\r\n\r\nAt the death of Ascanius the Latins gave the preference in the matter\r\nof royal power to the son borne to AEneas by Lavinia over the son of\r\nAscanius, their preference being founded on the fact that Latinus was\r\nhis grandfather. The new king's name was Silvius. Silvius begat AEneas,\r\nfrom AEneas sprang Latinus, and Latinus was succeeded by Pastis.\r\nTiberinus, who came subsequently to be ruler, lost his life by falling\r\ninto a river called the Albula. This river was renamed _Tiber_ from\r\nhim. It flows through Rome and is of great value to the city and in\r\nthe highest degree useful to the Romans. Amulius, a descendant of\r\nTiberinus, displayed an overweening pride and had the audacity to\r\ndeify himself, pretending an ability to answer thunder with thunder by\r\nmechanical contrivances and to lighten in response to the lightnings\r\nand to hurl thunderbolts. He met his end by the overflow of the lake\r\nbeside which his palace was set, and both he and the palace were\r\nsubmerged in the sudden rush of waters. Aventinus his son perished in\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nSo far the account concerns Lavinium and the people of Alba. At the\r\nbeginning of Roman history we see Numitor and Amulius, who were\r\ngrandsons of Aventinus and descendants of AEneas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 2, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 672 (_a.u._ 82)] VII, 6.--When Numa died leaving no\r\nsuccessor, Tullus Hostilius was chosen by the people and the senate.\r\nHe followed in the footsteps of Romulus, and both welcomed combats\r\nhimself and encouraged the people to do the same. The Albanians having\r\nbecome the victims of a marauding expedition on the part of the the\r\nRomans, both sides proceeded into battle; before they came into actual\r\nconflict, however, they effected a reconciliation and both races\r\ndecided to dwell together in one city. [Sidenote: FRAG. 6^2] BUT AS\r\nEACH CLUNG TO HIS OWN TOWN AND INSISTED THAT THE OTHER RACE SHOULD\r\nREMOVE TO IT, THEY FAILED OF THEIR OBJECT. NEXT THEY DISPUTED ABOUT\r\nTHE LEADERSHIP. As neither one would yield it to the other, [Sidenote:\r\nFRAG. 6^2] THEY ARRANGED TO HAVE A CONTEST FOR THE SOVEREIGNTY. They\r\ndid not care to fight with entire armies nor yet to let the decision\r\nbe made by a duel of champions. But there were on both sides brethren\r\nborn three at a birth, the offspring of twin mothers, of like age and\r\nalike in strength: the Roman brethren were called Publihoratii and the\r\nAlbanian Curiatii. These they set into battle over against one\r\nanother, paying no heed to their relationship. So they, having armed\r\nthemselves and having arrayed themselves in opposing files in the\r\nvacant space between the camps, called upon the same family gods and\r\ncast repeated glances upward at the sun. Having joined issue they\r\nfought now in groups, now in pairs. Finally, when two of the Romans\r\nhad fallen and all of the Albanians had been wounded, the remaining\r\nHoratius, because he could not withstand the three at once, even were\r\nhe unwounded, gave way in order that in pursuing him they might be\r\nscattered. And when they had become separated in the pursuit,\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 6^2] ATTACKING EACH ONE he despatched them all. Then\r\nhe was given honors. But because he further killed his sister when she\r\nlamented on seeing Horatius carrying the spoils of her cousins, he was\r\ntried for murder; and having taken an appeal to the people he was\r\nreleased.\r\n\r\nThe Albanians now became subjects of the Romans, but later they\r\ndisregarded the compact; and having been summoned, in their capacity\r\nof subjects, to serve as allies, they attempted at the crisis of the\r\nbattle to desert to the enemy and to join in the attack upon the\r\nRomans. They were detected, however, and punished: many (including\r\ntheir leader, Mettius) were put to death, and the rest suffered\r\ndeportation; their city Alba was razed to the ground, after being\r\ndeemed for five hundred years the mother city of the Romans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 6^4] NOW AGAINST THE ENEMY TULLUS WAS THOUGHT TO BE\r\nVERY EFFICIENT, BUT HE NEGLECTED RELIGION. WHEN, HOWEVER, A PESTILENCE\r\nWAS INCURRED AND HE HIMSELF FELL SICK, HE TURNED ASIDE TO A GODFEARING\r\nCOURSE. He is said to have reached the end of his life by being\r\nconsumed by lightning[5] or else as the result of a plot formed by\r\nAncus Marcius, who happened to be (as has been stated) a son of Numa's\r\ndaughter. He was king of the Romans thirty-two years.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The first alternative agrees with Plutarch, who, at the\r\nend of his life of Numa (chapter 22), says that this death by\r\nlightning of Tullus Hostilius caused many among the population at\r\nlarge to revere that religion which their king had for so long a time\r\nneglected.]\r\n\r\nVII, 7.--When Hostilius died, Marcius succeeded to the kingdom,\r\nreceiving it as a voluntary gift from the Romans. And he was not\r\nperfect in his arm, for he was maimed at the joint (or bend), whence\r\nhe got the title Ancus (bent arm). Though gentle he was compelled to\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 7] CHANGE HIS HABITS and he turned his attention to\r\ncampaigns. For the rest of the Latins, on account of the destruction\r\nof Alba and in fear that they themselves might suffer some similar\r\ndisaster, were angry at the Romans. As long as Tullus survived, they\r\nhumbled themselves, dreading his reputation for warfare: but thinking\r\nthat Marcius was easy to attack because of his peaceful disposition,\r\nthey assailed his territory and pillaged it. He, [Sidenote: FRAG. 7]\r\nCOMPREHENDING THAT PEACE COULD BE CAUSED BY WAR, attacked the\r\nattackers, defended his position, and captured their cities, one of\r\nwhich he razed to the ground, and treated many of the men taken as\r\nslaves and transferred many others to Rome. As the Romans grew and\r\nland was added to their domain, the neighboring peoples were\r\ndispleased and set themselves at odds with the Romans. Hence the\r\nlatter had to overcome the Fidenates by siege, and they damaged the\r\nSabines by falling upon them while scattered and seizing their camp,\r\nand by terrifying others they got them to embrace peace even contrary\r\nto inclination. After this the life-stint of Marcius was exhausted,\r\nwhen he had ruled for twenty-four years, being a man that paid strict\r\nattention to religion according to the manner of his grandfather Numa.\r\n\r\nVII, 8.--The sovereignty was now appropriated by Lucius Tarquinius,\r\nwho was the son of Demaratus a Corinthian, borne to the latter by a\r\nnative woman after he had been exiled and had taken up his abode in\r\nTarquinii, an Etruscan city; the boy had been named Lucumo. And though\r\nhe inherited much wealth from his father, yet, because as an immigrant\r\nhe was not deemed worthy of the highest offices by the people of\r\nTarquinii, he removed to Rome, changing his appellation along with his\r\ncity; and he changed his name to Lucius Tarquinius,--from the city in\r\nwhich he dwelt. It is said that as he was journeying to his new home\r\nan eagle swooped down and snatched the cap which he had on his head,\r\nand after soaring aloft and screaming for some time placed it again\r\nexactly upon his head: wherefore he was inspired to hope for no small\r\nadvancement and eagerly took up his residence in Rome. Hence not long\r\nafter he was numbered among the foremost men. [Sidenote: FRAG. 8] FOR\r\nBY USING HIS WEALTH QUITE LAVISHLY AND BY WINNING OVER THE NOBLES\r\nTHROUGH HIS INTELLIGENCE AND WIT HE WAS INCLUDED AMONG THE PATRICIANS\r\nAND IN THE SENATE BY MARCIUS, WAS APPOINTED PRAETOR, AND WAS ENTRUSTED\r\nWITH THE SUPERVISION OF THE KING'S CHILDREN AND OF THE KINGDOM. HE\r\nSHOWED HIMSELF AN EXCELLENT MAN, SHARING HIS MONEY WITH THOSE IN NEED\r\nAND BESTOWING HIS SERVICES READILY IF ANY ONE NEEDED HIM TO HELP. HE\r\nNEITHER DID NOR SAID ANYTHING MEAN TO ANY ONE. IF HE RECEIVED A\r\nKINDNESS FROM PERSONS HE MADE MUCH OF THE ATTENTION, WHEREAS IF ANY\r\nOFFENCE WAS OFFERED HIM, HE EITHER DISREGARDED THE INJURY OR MINIMIZED\r\nIT AND MADE LIGHT OF IT, AND FAR FROM MAKING REPRISALS UPON THE MAN\r\nTHAT HAD DONE THE INJURY, HE WOULD EVEN BENEFIT HIM. THUS HE CAME TO\r\nDOMINATE BOTH MARCIUS HIMSELF AND HIS CIRCLE, AND ACQUIRED THE\r\nREPUTATION OF BEING A SENSIBLE AND UPRIGHT MAN.\r\n\r\nBut the aforesaid estimate of him did not continue permanently. For at\r\nthe death of Marcius he behaved in a knavish way to the latter's two\r\nsons and made the kingdom his own. The senate and the people were\r\nintending to elect the children of Marcius, when Tarquinius made\r\nadvances to the most influential of the senators;--he had first\r\nsent the fatherless boys to some distant point on a hunting\r\nexpedition:--and by his talk and his efforts he got these men to vote\r\nhim the kingdom on the understanding that he would restore it to the\r\nchildren when they had attained manhood. And after assuming control of\r\naffairs he so disposed the Romans that they should never wish to\r\nchoose the children in preference to him: the lads he accustomed to\r\nindolence and ruined their souls and bodies by a kind of kindness. As\r\nhe still felt afraid in spite of being so placed, he secured some\r\nextra strength for himself in the senate. Those of the populace who\r\nfelt friendly towards him he enrolled (to the number of about two\r\nhundred) among the patricians and the senators, and thus he put both\r\nthe senate and the people within his own control. He altered his\r\nraiment, likewise, to a more magnificent style. It consisted of toga\r\nand tunic, purple all over and shot with gold, of a crown of precious\r\nstones set in gold, and of ivory sceptre and chair, which were later\r\nused by various officials and especially by those that held sway as\r\nemperors. He also on the occasion of a triumph paraded with a\r\nfour-horse chariot and kept twelve lictors for life.\r\n\r\nHe would certainly have introduced still other and more numerous\r\ninnovations, had not Attus Navius prevented him, when he desired to\r\nrearrange the tribes: this man was an augur whose equal has never been\r\nseen. Tarquinius, angry at his opposition, took measures to abase him\r\nand to bring his art into contempt. So, putting into his bosom a\r\nwhetstone and a razor, he went among the populace having in his mind\r\nthat the whetstone should be cut by the razor,--a thing that is\r\nimpossible. He said all that he wished, and when Attus vehemently\r\nopposed him, he said, still yielding not a particle: \"If you are not\r\nopposing me out of quarrelsomeness, but are speaking the truth, answer\r\nme in the presence of all these witnesses whether what I have in mind\r\nto do shall be performed.\" Attus, having taken an augury on almost the\r\nvery spot, replied immediately: \"Verily, O King, what you intend shall\r\nbe fulfilled.\" \"Well, then,\" said the other, \"take this whetstone and\r\ncut it through with this razor; this is what I have had in mind to\r\ncome to pass.\" Attus at once took the stone and cut it through.\r\nTarquinius, in admiration, heaped various honors upon him, accorded\r\nhim the privilege of a bronze image, and did not again make any change\r\nin the established constitution, but employed Attus as a counselor on\r\nall matters.\r\n\r\nHe fought against the Latins who had revolted, and afterwards against\r\nthe Sabines, who, aided by the Etruscans as allies, had invaded the\r\nRoman country; and he conquered them all. He discovered that one of\r\nthe priestesses of Vesta, who are required by custom to remain virgins\r\nall their life, had been seduced by a man, whereupon he arranged a\r\nkind of underground chamber with a long passage, and after placing in\r\nit a bed, a light, and a table nearly full of foods, he brought\r\nthither the unchaste woman escorted by a procession and having\r\nintroduced her alive into the room walled it up. From his institution\r\nthis plan of punishing those of the priestesses that do not keep their\r\nvirginity has continued to prevail. The men that outrage them have\r\ntheir necks inserted in cloven pillars in the Forum, and then are\r\nmaltreated naked until they give up the ghost.\r\n\r\nHowever, an attack was made upon Tarquinius by the children of Marcius\r\nbecause he would not yield the sovereignty to them, but instead placed\r\na certain Tullius, borne to him by a slave woman, at the head of them\r\nall. This more than anything else displeased the patricians. The young\r\nmen interested some of the latter class in their cause and formed a\r\nplot against the king. They arrayed two men like rustics, equipped\r\nwith axes and scythes, and made them ready to attack him. So these\r\ntwo, when they did not find Tarquinius in the Forum, went to the royal\r\ncourt (pretending, of course, to have a dispute with each other) and\r\nasked for admission to his presence. Their request was granted and\r\nthey began to make opposing arguments, and while Tarquinius was giving\r\nhis attention to one of them pleading his cause, the other slew him.\r\n\r\nVII, 9.--Such was the end that befell Tarquinius who had ruled for\r\nthirty-eight years. By the cooeperation of Tanaquil, wife of\r\nTarquinius, Tullius succeeded to the kingdom of Rome. He was the child\r\nof a certain woman named Ocrisia, the wife of Spurius Tullius, a\r\nLatin; she had been captured in the war and chosen by Tarquinius: she\r\nhad either become pregnant at home or conceived after her capture;\r\nboth stories are current. When Tullius had reached boyhood he went to\r\nsleep on a chair once in the daytime and a quantity of fire seemed to\r\nleap from his head. Tarquinius, seeing it, took an active interest in\r\nthe child and on his arriving at maturity had him enrolled among the\r\npatricians and in the senate.\r\n\r\nThe murderers of Tarquinius were arrested and his wife and Tullius\r\nlearned the plan of the plot; but instead of making Tarquinius's death\r\nknown at once, they took him up and tended him (pretending that he was\r\nstill alive), and meantime exchanged mutual pledges that Tullius\r\nshould take the sovereignty but surrender it to Tanaquil's sons when\r\nthey became men. And when the multitude ran together and raised an\r\noutcry, Tanaquil, leaning out of an upper story, said: \"Be not afraid.\r\nMy husband both lives and shall be seen by you shortly. But in order\r\nthat he may regain health at leisure and that no hindrance to business\r\nmay arise from his being incapacitated, he entrusts the management of\r\nthe public weal for the present to Tullius.\" These were her words and\r\nthe people not unwillingly accepted Tullius: for he was thought to be\r\nan upright man.\r\n\r\nSo, having been granted the administration of public affairs, he\r\nmanaged them for the most part according to orders supposed to emanate\r\nfrom Tarquinius. [Sidenote: FRAG. 9] BUT WHEN HE SAW THE PEOPLE\r\nOBEYING HIM IN ALL POINTS, he brought the assassins of Tarquinius\r\nbefore the senate, though, to be sure, only because of their plot; for\r\nhe was still pretending that the king was still alive. They were\r\nsentenced and put to death, and the sons of Marcius through fear took\r\nrefuge among the Volsci. Then did Tullius reveal the death of\r\nTarquinius and openly take possession of the kingdom. At first he put\r\nforward the children of Tarquinius as his excuse and caused it to be\r\nunderstood that he was the guardian of their royal office, but\r\nafterward he proceeded to pay court to the people, believing that he\r\ncould secure control of the multitude very much more easily than of\r\nthe patricians. He gave them money, assigned land to each individual,\r\nand made preparations to free the slaves and adopt them into tribes.\r\nAs the nobles were irritated at this, he gave instructions that those\r\nliberated should perform some services, in requital, for the men that\r\nhad liberated them. Now since the patricians were disaffected in the\r\nmatter of his aspirations and circulated among other sayings one to\r\nthe effect that no one had chosen him to hold the sovereignty, he\r\ngathered the people and harangued them. And by the use of many\r\nalluring statements he so disposed them toward himself that they at\r\nonce voted the kingdom to him outright. He in return bestowed many\r\ngifts upon them and enrolled some of them in the senate. These\r\noriginally in most matters were at a disadvantage as compared with the\r\npatricians, but as time went on they shared equally with the\r\npatricians in everything save the office of interrex and the\r\npriesthoods, and were distinguished from them in no respect except by\r\ntheir shoes. For the shoes of the patricians were made ornate by the\r\naddition of straps and the imprint of the letter, which were intended\r\nto signify that they were descended from the original hundred men that\r\nhad been senators. The letter R, they say, either indicates the number\r\nof the hundred men referred to or else is used as the initial of the\r\nname of the Romans.\r\n\r\nIn this way Tullius gained control of the populace, but fearing that\r\nsome rebellion might take place he delivered the greater number and\r\nthe more important of the public positions to the care of the more\r\npowerful citizens. Thus they became harmonious in their views and\r\ntransacted the public business in the best manner. He also conducted a\r\nfew wars against the Veians and against all the Etruscans, in the\r\ncourse of which nothing was done worthy of record. Wishing to\r\naffiliate the Latins still more closely with the Romans he persuaded\r\nthem to construct in Rome a temple out of common funds. This he\r\ndevoted to Minerva. But differences arose in regard to its\r\nsuperintendence. Meantime a Sabine brought to Rome an exceedingly fine\r\ncow, intending to sacrifice her to Minerva in accordance with an\r\noracle. The oracle said that he who should sacrifice her would enlarge\r\nhis country. One of the Romans learning this went to the man and told\r\nhim that it was requisite for the victim first to be purified in the\r\nriver, and by his talk persuaded him. Having persuaded him he took the\r\ncow under the pretence of keeping her safe and having taken her he\r\nsacrificed her. When the Sabine made known the oracle the Latins both\r\nyielded the presidency of the shrine to the Romans and in other ways\r\nhonored them as superior to themselves.\r\n\r\nThis was the course these matters took. Now Tullius joined his\r\ndaughters in marriage with the Tarquins, and though he announced that\r\nhe was going to restore the kingdom to them he kept putting it off,\r\nnow on one excuse and now on another. And they were not at all\r\ndisposed to be complaisant, but were indignant. The king paid no heed\r\nto them and urged the Romans to democracy and freedom. Then were the\r\nTarquins all the more disquieted. But the younger one, however ill at\r\nease he was, still endured it, until in the course of time he thought\r\nhe could bear Tullius no longer. And when he found that his wife did\r\nnot approve his attitude, nor did his brother, he put to death his own\r\nwife [Sidenote: FRAG. 10^1] AND COMPASSED HIS BROTHER'S DEATH BY\r\nPOISON ADMINISTERED BY THE LATTER'S WIFE. Then, uniting his fortunes\r\nwith his brother's spouse, he plotted with her help against Tullius.\r\nAfter persuading many of the senators and patricians whose reputations\r\nwere under a cloud to cooeperate with him against Tullius he\r\nunexpectedly repaired with them to the senate, his wife Tullia also\r\nfollowing him. He there spoke many words to remind them of his\r\nfather's worth and uttered many jests at the expense of Tullius. When\r\nthe latter on hearing of it hastily made his appearance and said a\r\nword or two, the pretender seized him, and thrusting him out cast him\r\ndown the steps in front of the senate-house. So the king, bewildered\r\nby the audacity of Tarquin and surprised that no one came to his\r\nassistance, did not say or do anything more. Tarquin at once obtained\r\nthe kingdom from the senate, and sent some men who despatched Tullius\r\nwhile he was on his way home. The latter's daughter, after embracing\r\nher husband in the senate-house and saluting him as king, departed to\r\nthe palace and drove her chariot over the dead body of her father as\r\nhe lay there.\r\n\r\nVII, 10.--Thus ruled Tullius and thus he died after a reign of\r\nforty-four years. Tarquin, who succeeded to the kingdom, stationed\r\nbody-guards around him after the manner of Romulus, and used them both\r\nnight and day, at home and abroad. For, as a result of what he had\r\ndone to his father-in-law, and his wife to her father, they in turn\r\nwere afraid of other people. [Sidenote: FRAG. 10^2] AND WHEN HE HAD\r\nEQUIPPED HIMSELF TO RULE OVER THEM TYRANNICALLY HE ARRESTED AND PUT TO\r\nDEATH THE MOST POWERFUL MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND OF THE REST,\r\nEXECUTING PUBLICLY THOSE AGAINST WHOM HE WAS ABLE TO BRING A CHARGE,\r\nAND OTHERS SECRETLY; SOME ALSO HE BANISHED. HE DESTROYED NOT MERELY\r\nTHOSE WHO WERE ATTACHED TO THE PARTY OF TULLIUS, BUT IN ADDITION THOSE\r\nWHO HAD COOPERATED WITH HIM IN SECURING THE MONARCHY, AND THUS HE MADE\r\nAWAY WITH THE BEST PART OF THE SENATE AND OF THE KNIGHTS. HE\r\nUNDERSTOOD THAT HE WAS HATED BY THE ENTIRE POPULACE; HENCE HE DID NOT\r\nAPPOINT ANY PERSONS WHATEVER TO TAKE THE PLACES OF THOSE WHO KEPT\r\nPERISHING, BUT UNDERTAKING TO ABOLISH THE SENATE ALTOGETHER HE DID NOT\r\nAPPOINT A SINGLE NEW PERSON TO IT AND COMMUNICATED NO NEWS OF\r\nIMPORTANCE TO THOSE WHO STILL WERE MEMBERS. HE CALLED THE SENATORS\r\nTOGETHER NOT TO HELP HIM IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF ANY IMPORTANT\r\nMEASURES, BUT IN ORDER THAT THEIR FEWNESS MIGHT BE MADE EVIDENT TO ALL\r\nAND THEY BE CONSEQUENTLY DESPISED. MOST OF HIS BUSINESS HE CARRIED ON\r\nBY HIMSELF OR WITH THE AID OF HIS SONS. IT WAS HARD TO APPROACH AND\r\nHARD TO ACCOST HIM, AND HE SHOWED GREAT HAUGHTINESS AND BRUTALITY\r\nTOWARD ALL ALIKE, AND HE AS WELL AS HIS CHILDREN ADOPTED A MORE\r\nTYRANNICAL BEARING TOWARD ALL PERSONS. Hence he also cast eyes of\r\nsuspicion upon the members of his guard and secured a new body-guard\r\nfrom the Latin nation, intermingling the Latins with Romans in the\r\nranks. He intended that the Latins by obtaining equal privileges with\r\nthe Romans should owe him gratitude therefor, and that the Romans\r\nshould cause him less terror, since they no longer had a place of\r\ntheir own but bore arms only in association with the Latins.\r\n\r\nHe also joined battle with the people of Gabii and fared ill in the\r\nconflict, but by treachery overcame them; for he suggested to his son\r\nSextus that he desert to their side. Sextus, in order to get some\r\nplausible pretext for the desertion, [Sidenote: FRAG. 10^3] REVILED\r\nHIS FATHER PUBLICLY AS A TYRANT AND FORESWORN, and the latter flogged\r\nhis son and took measures of defence. Then, according to arrangement,\r\nthe son made his treacherous desertion to the people of Gabii, taking\r\nalong with him money and companions. The enemy believed the trick on\r\naccount of the cruelty of Tarquin and because at this time the son\r\nspoke many words of truth in abusing his father and by his conduct\r\nseemed to have become thoroughly estranged from him. So they were very\r\nglad to receive him, and in his company made many incursions into\r\nRoman territory and did it no slight damage. For this reason and\r\nbecause he privately furnished some persons with money and spent it\r\nlavishly for public purposes he was chosen praetor by them and was\r\nentrusted with the management of the government among them. At that he\r\nsecretly sent a man and acquainted his father with what had occurred,\r\nasking him for his intentions with regard to the future. The king made\r\nno answer to the emissary, in order that he might not, being equally\r\ninformed, either willingly or unwillingly reveal something; but\r\nleading him into a garden where there were poppies he struck off with\r\na rod the heads that were prominent and strewed the ground with them;\r\nhereupon he dismissed the message-bearer. The latter, without\r\ncomprehending the affair, repeated the king's actions to Sextus, and\r\nhe understood the sense of the suggestion. Therefore he destroyed the\r\nmore eminent men of Gabii, some secretly by poison, others by robbers\r\n(supposedly), and still others he put to death after judicial trial by\r\ncontriving against them false accusations of traitorous dealings with\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nThus did Sextus visit sorrow upon the men of Gabii and destroyed their\r\nsuperior citizens, distributing their money among the crowd. Later,\r\nwhen some had already perished and the rest had been cozened and\r\nthoroughly believed in him, assisted by the Roman captives and the\r\ndeserters (many of whom he had gathered for his projects), he seized\r\nthe city and surrendered it to his father. The king bestowed it upon\r\nhis son, but himself made war upon other nations.\r\n\r\nVII, 11.--The oracles of the Sibyl to the Romans he obtained even\r\nagainst his will. A woman whom they called Sibyl, gifted with divine\r\ninspiration, came to Rome bringing [Sidenote: FRAG. 10^4] THREE OR\r\nNINE books, offered these to Tarquin for purchase, and stated the\r\nvalue of the books. As he paid no attention to her, she burned one or\r\nthree of the books. When again Tarquin scorned her, she destroyed part\r\nof the rest in a similar way. And she was about to burn up also those\r\nstill left when the augurs compelled him to purchase the few that were\r\nintact. He bought these for the price for which he might have secured\r\nthem all, and delivered them to two senators to keep. As they did not\r\nentirely understand the contents, they sent to Greece and hired two\r\nmen to come from there to read and interpret these things. The\r\ndwellers in the vicinity, desiring to learn what was revealed by the\r\nbooks, [Sidenote: FRAG. 10^4] MANAGED TO BRIBE MARCUS ACILIUS,[6] ONE\r\nOF THE CUSTODIANS, AND HAD SOME STATEMENTS COPIED OUT. THE AFFAIR\r\nBECAME PUBLIC AND MARCUS AFTER BEING THROWN INTO TWO HIDES SEWN\r\nTOGETHER was drowned (and beginning with him this punishment has ever\r\nsince prevailed in the case of parricides), in order that earth nor\r\nwater nor sun might be defiled by his death.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Zonaras spells _Acillius_.]\r\n\r\nThe temple on the Tarpeian rock he constructed according to the vow of\r\nhis father. And the earth having yawned even to the substructure of\r\nthe foundations there appeared the head of a man freshly slain, still\r\nwith blood in it. Accordingly the Romans sent to a soothsayer of\r\nEtruria to ask what was signified by the phenomenon. And he, desiring\r\nto make the portent apply to Etruria, made a diagram upon the ground\r\nand in it laid out the plan of Rome and the Tarpeian rock. He intended\r\nto ask the envoys: \"Is this Rome? Is this the Rock? Was the head found\r\nhere?\" They would suspect nothing and agree in their assent, and so\r\nthe efficacy of the portent would be transferred to the place where it\r\nhad been shown in the diagram. This was his design, but the envoys\r\nlearned from his son what his device was, and when the question was\r\nput to them, they answered: \"The settlement of Rome is not here, but\r\nin Latium, and the hill is in the country of the Romans, and the head\r\nwas found on that hill.\" Thus the design of the soothsayer was\r\nthwarted and they learned the whole truth and reported it to their\r\nfellow-citizens, to wit, that they should be very powerful and rule\r\nvery many people. So this was another event that imbued them with\r\nhope. Then the hill was renamed by them \"Capitolium\": for _capita_ in\r\nthe Roman speech means \"the head.\"\r\n\r\nNeeding money for the building of the temple Tarquin waged war upon\r\nthe inhabitants of Ardea; but from it he gained no money, and he was\r\ndriven out of the kingdom. Signs also came in his way that indicated\r\nhis expulsion. Out of his garden vultures drove the young of eagles,\r\nand in the men's hall, where he was having a banquet with his friends,\r\na huge serpent appeared and caused him and his companions at table to\r\ndecamp. In consequence of this he sent his sons Titus and Aruns to\r\nDelphi. But as Apollo declared that he should not be driven from his\r\ndomain till a dog should use human speech, he was elated with hopes\r\nfor the best, thinking that the oracle could never be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 10^5] NOW LUCIUS JUNIUS WAS A SON OF TARQUIN'S\r\nSISTER; HIS FATHER AND BROTHER TARQUIN HAD KILLED. SO HE, FEARING FOR\r\nHIS OWN PERSON, FEIGNED MADNESS, EMPLOYING THIS MEANS OF SAFETY AS A\r\nSCREEN FOR HIS LIFE. HENCE HE WAS DUBBED BRUTUS, FOR THIS IS THE NAME\r\nBY WHICH THE LATINS ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CALL IDIOTS. WHILE PRETENDING TO\r\nBE MAD HE WAS TAKEN ALONG AS A PLAYTHING BY THE CHILDREN OF TARQUIN,\r\nWHEN THEY JOURNEYED TO DELPHI. AND HE SAID THAT HE WAS CARRYING A\r\nVOTIVE OFFERING TO THE GOD; THIS WAS A STAFF, APPARENTLY POSSESSING NO\r\nPOINT OF EXCELLENCE, so that he became a laughing stock for it all the\r\nmore. It furnished a kind of image of the affliction that he feigned.\r\nFor he had hollowed it out and had secretly poured in gold, indicating\r\nthereby that the disesteem which he suffered for his madness served to\r\nconceal a sound and estimable intelligence. [Sidenote: FRAG. 10^7] TO\r\nTHE QUERY OF THE SONS OF TARQUIN AS TO WHO SHOULD SUCCEED TO THEIR\r\nFATHER'S SOVEREIGNTY THE GOD REPLIED THAT THE FIRST WHO KISSED HIS\r\nMOTHER SHOULD OBTAIN THE POWER. AND BRUTUS, COMPREHENDING, FELL DOWN\r\nAS IF ACCIDENTALLY AND COVERED THE EARTH WITH KISSES, RIGHTLY DEEMING\r\nHER TO BE THE MOTHER OF ALL.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 10^8] THIS BRUTUS OVERTHREW THE TARQUINS, taking as\r\nhis justification the case of Lucretia, though these rulers were even\r\nwithout that hated by all for their tyrannous and violent\r\ncharacteristics. Lucretia was a daughter of Lucretius Spurius, a man\r\nthat was a member of the senate, and she was wife of the distinguished\r\nTarquinius Collatinus and was renowned, as it chanced, for her beauty\r\nand chastity. [Sidenote: FRAG. 10^8] SEXTUS, THE SON OF TARQUIN, SET\r\nHIS HEART UPON OUTRAGING HER, NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE HE WAS INSPIRED WITH\r\nPASSION BY HER BEAUTY AS BECAUSE HE CHOSE TO PLOT AGAINST HER CHASTE\r\nREPUTATION. SO, HAVING WATCHED FOR COLLATINUS TO BE AWAY FROM HOME, HE\r\nCAME BY NIGHT TO HER AND LODGED AT HER HOUSE, SINCE SHE WAS THE WIFE\r\nOF A RELATIVE. AND FIRST HE TRIED BY PERSUASION TO SECURE ILLICIT\r\nPLEASURE FROM HER AND THEN HE RESORTED TO VIOLENCE. AS HE COULD NOT\r\nSUCCEED, HE THREATENED TO CUT HER THROAT. BUT INASMUCH AS SHE DESPISED\r\nDEATH, HE THREATENED FURTHERMORE TO LAY A SLAVE BESIDE HER AND TO KILL\r\nTHEM BOTH AND TO SPREAD THE REPORT THAT HE HAD FOUND THEM SLEEPING\r\nTOGETHER AND KILLED THEM. THIS RENDERED LUCRETIA DISTRAUGHT, AND IN\r\nFEAR THAT THIS MIGHT BE BELIEVED TO HAVE SO HAPPENED SHE SURRENDERED.\r\nAND AFTER THE ACT OF ADULTERY SHE PLACED A DAGGER BENEATH THE PILLOW\r\nAND SENT FOR HER HUSBAND AND HER FATHER. WHEN THEY CAME, ACCOMPANIED\r\nBY BRUTUS AND PUBLIUS VALERIUS, SHE SHED MANY TEARS AND WITH MOANS\r\nRELATED THE ENTIRE TRANSACTION. THEN SHE ADDED: \"AND I WILL TREAT MY\r\nCASE AS BECOMES ME, BUT DO YOU, IF YOU ARE MEN, AVENGE ME, YOURSELVES,\r\nAND SHOW THE TYRANTS WHAT MANNER OF CREATURES YOU ARE AND WHAT MANNER\r\nOF WOMAN THEY HAVE OUTRAGED.\" HAVING SPOKEN TO THIS EFFECT SHE\r\nIMMEDIATELY DREW THE DAGGER FROM ITS HIDING PLACE AND KILLED HERSELF.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 4, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\nVII, 13.--The Sabines, however, because of wrath at their treatment,\r\ndid not keep quiet even through the winter, but overran Roman\r\nterritory and damaged the forces of Postumius when he was for the\r\nsecond time consul. And they would absolutely have captured him, had\r\nnot Menenius Agrippa, his colleague, come to his aid. And assaulting\r\nthem they killed a number, with the result that the rest withdrew.\r\nAfter this Spurius Cassius and Opiter Verginius as consuls made peace\r\nwith the Sabines. And capturing the city of Camerium they executed\r\nmost of the inhabitants; the remnant they took alive and sold, and\r\nrazed the city to the ground.\r\n\r\nPostumius Cominius and Titus Larcius arrested and put to death some\r\nslaves who were hatching a conspiracy to seize the Capitoline. Servius\r\nSulpicius and Marcus Tullius in their turn anticipated a second\r\nconspiracy composed of slaves and some others that had joined them,\r\nfor it was reported to the consuls by certain men privy to the plot.\r\nThey surrounded and overpowered the conspirators and cut them down. To\r\nthe informers citizenship and other rewards were given.\r\n\r\nWhen a new war was stirred up on the part of the Latins against Rome,\r\nthe people, demanding that a cancellation of debts be authorized,\r\nrefused to take up arms. Therefore the nobles then for the first time\r\nestablished a new office to have jurisdiction over both classes.\r\nDictator was the name given to the person entitled to the position,\r\nand he possessed all powers as much as had the kings. People hated the\r\nname of king on account of the Tarquins, but being anxious for the\r\nbenefit to be derived from sole leadership (which seemed to exert a\r\npotent influence amid conditions of war and revolution), they chose it\r\nunder another name. Hence the dictatorship was, as has been said, so\r\nfar as its authority went, equivalent to kingship, except that the\r\ndictator might not ride on horseback unless he were about to start on\r\na campaign, and was not permitted to make any expenditure from the\r\npublic funds unless the right were specially voted. He might try men\r\nand put them to death at home and on campaigns, and not merely such as\r\nbelonged to the populace, but also members of the knights and of the\r\nsenate itself. No one had the power to make any complaint against him\r\nnor to take any action hostile to him,--no, not even the\r\ntribunes,--and no case could be appealed from him. The office of\r\ndictator extended for a period of not more than six months, to the end\r\nthat no such official by spending much time in the midst of so much\r\npower and unhampered authority should become haughty and plunge\r\nheadlong into a passion for sole leadership. This was what happened\r\nlater to Julius Caesar, when contrary to lawful precedent he had been\r\napproved for the dictatorship.\r\n\r\nVII, 14.--At this time, consequently, when Larcius became dictator,\r\nthe populace made no uprising but presented themselves under arms.\r\nWhen, however, the Latins came to terms and were now in a quiescent\r\nstate, the lenders proceeded to treat the debtors more harshly and\r\nthe populace for this reason again rebelled and even came running in a\r\nthrong into the senate. And all the senators would there have perished\r\nat the hands of the inrushing mob, had not some persons at this\r\njuncture reported that the Volsci had invaded the country. In the face\r\nof such news the populace became calm, not regarding this action,\r\nhowever, in the light of clemency to the senate, for they felt sure\r\nthat that body would almost immediately be destroyed by the enemy.\r\nHence they did not take the trouble to man the walls nor render any\r\nassistance until Servilius released the prisoners held for default of\r\npayments and decreed a suspension of taxes for as long as the campaign\r\nlasted and promised to reduce the debts. Then in consequence of these\r\nconcessions they proceeded against the enemy and won the day.\r\nInasmuch, however, as they were not relieved of their debts and in\r\ngeneral could obtain no decent treatment, they again raised a clamor\r\nand grew full of wrath and made an uprising against both the senate\r\nand the praetors.\r\n\r\nBut at the approach of another war the praetors decreed a cancellation\r\nof debts: others opposed this measure: and so Marcus Valerius was\r\nnamed dictator. He was of the kindred of Poplicola and was beloved by\r\nthe people. Then, indeed, so many gathered, animated with such zeal\r\n(for he had promised them prizes, too), that they overran not only the\r\nSabines, but the Volsci and AEqui who were allied with them. As a\r\nsequel, the populace voted many honors to Valerius, one of which was\r\ntheir bestowal of the title Maximus. This name, translated into Greek,\r\nsignifies \"greatest.\" And he, wishing to do the populace some favors,\r\nmade many addresses to the senate but could not get it to follow his\r\nguidance. Consequently he rushed out of the senatorial assembly in a\r\nrage, and after making to the populace a long speech against the\r\nsenate resigned his command. [Sidenote: FRAG. 16^4] AND THE POPULACE\r\nWAS ALL THE MORE PROVOKED TO REVOLT. AS FOR THE MONEY-LENDERS, BY\r\nINSISTING IN THE CASE OF DEBTS UPON THE VERY LETTER OF THE AGREEMENT\r\nAND REFUSING TO MAKE ANY CONCESSION TO THOSE WHO OWED THEM THEY BOTH\r\nFAILED TO SECURE THE EXACT AMOUNT AND WERE DISAPPOINTED IN MANY OTHER\r\nHOPES. FOR POVERTY AND THE RESULTING DESPERATION IS A HEAVY CURSE, AND\r\nIS, IF IT SPREADS AMONG A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE, VERY DIFFICULT TO\r\nCOMBAT. NOW THE CAUSE OF MOST OF THE TROUBLES THAT BEFELL THE ROMANS\r\nLAY IN THE UNYIELDING ATTITUDE ADOPTED AT THIS TIME BY THE MORE\r\nPOWERFUL TOWARD THEIR INFERIORS. For as the military contingent came\r\nto be hard pressed by dint of campaigns and was baffled out and out in\r\nfrequent hopes frequently entertained, and the debtors were repeatedly\r\nabused and maltreated by the money-lenders, the people became inflamed\r\nto such a pitch of fury that many of the destitute abandoned the city,\r\nwithdrew from the camp, [Sidenote: FRAG. 16^5] AND LIKE ENEMIES\r\nGATHERED THEIR SUBSISTENCE FROM THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nWHEN THIS SITUATION HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT, SINCE NUMBERS CAME\r\nFLOCKING TO THE SIDE OF THE REVOLUTIONISTS, THE SENATORS, DREADING\r\nTHAT THE LATTER MIGHT BECOME MORE ESTRANGED AND THE NEIGHBORING TRIBES\r\nJOIN THEIR REBELLION FOR PURPOSES OF ATTACK, MADE PROPOSITIONS TO THEM\r\nIN WHICH THEY PROMISED EVERYTHING THAT THE SENATE WAS EMPOWERED TO DO\r\nFOR THEM. BUT WHEN THEY DISPLAYED THE UTMOST AUDACITY AND WOULD ACCEPT\r\nNO OFFER, ONE OF THE ENVOYS, AGRIPPA MENENIUS, BEGGED THEM TO HEARKEN\r\nTO A FABLE. HAVING OBTAINED THEIR CONSENT HE SPOKE AS FOLLOWS. ONCE\r\nALL THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY BEGAN A CONTENTION AGAINST THE BELLY. AND\r\nTHE EYES SAID: \"WE GIVE THE HANDS THE POWER TO WORK AND THE FEET THE\r\nPOWER TO GO.\" AND THE TONGUE AND THE LIPS: \"THROUGH US THE COUNSELS OF\r\nTHE HEART ARE MADE KNOWN.\" AND THEN THE EARS: \"THROUGH US THE WORDS OF\r\nOTHERS ARE DESPATCHED TO THE MIND.\" AND THE HANDS: \"WE ARE THE WORKERS\r\nAND LAY UP STORES OF WEALTH.\" AND FINALLY THE FEET: \"WE TIRE OURSELVES\r\nOUT CARRYING THE WHOLE BODY IN JOURNEYS AND WHILE WORKING AND WHILE\r\nSTANDING.\" AND ALL IN A CHORUS: \"WHILE WE LABOR SO, THOU ALONE, FREE\r\nFROM CONTRIBUTION AND LABOR, LIKE A MISTRESS ART SERVED BY US ALL AND\r\nTHE FRUIT OF ALL OUR LABORS THOU THYSELF ALONE DOST ENJOY.\" THE BELLY\r\nHERSELF ADMITTED THAT THIS WAS SO, AND SAID SHE: \"IF YOU LIKE, LEAVE\r\nME UNSUPPLIED AND MAKE ME NO PRESENTS.\" THIS PROPOSITION SUITED, AND\r\nTHE MEMBERS VOTED NEVER MORE TO SUPPLY THE BELLY BY THEIR COMMON\r\nEFFORT. WHEN NO FOOD WAS PRESENTED TO HER, THE HANDS WERE NOT NIMBLE\r\nTO WORK, BEING RELAXED ON ACCOUNT OF THE FAILURE OF THE BELLY, NOR\r\nWERE THE FEET POSSESSED OF STRENGTH, NOR DID ANY OTHER OF THE LIMBS\r\nSHOW ITS NORMAL ACTIVITY UNINJURED, BUT ALL WERE INEFFICIENT, SLOW, OR\r\nCOMPLETELY MOTIONLESS. AND THEN THEY COMPREHENDED THAT THE PRESENTS\r\nMADE TO THE BELLY HAD BEEN SUPPLIED NOT MORE TO HER THAN TO THEMSELVES\r\nAND THAT EACH ONE OF THEM INCIDENTALLY ENJOYS THE BENEFIT CONFERRED\r\nUPON HER.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 16^5] THROUGH THESE WORDS THE POPULACE WAS MADE TO\r\nCOMPREHEND THAT THE ABUNDANCE OF THE PROSPEROUS TENDS ALSO TO THE\r\nADVANTAGE OF THE POOR, AND THAT EVEN THOUGH THE FORMER BE ADVANTAGED\r\nBY THEIR LOANS AND SO INCREASE THEIR ABUNDANCE, THE OUTCOME OF THIS IS\r\nNOT HURTFUL TO THE INTERESTS OF THE MANY; SINCE, IF IT WERE NOT FOR\r\nTHE WEALTHY OWNING PROPERTY, THE POOR WOULD NOT HAVE IN TIMES OF NEED\r\nPERSONS TO LEND TO THEM AND WOULD PERISH UNDER THE PRESSURE OF WANT.\r\nACCORDINGLY THEY BECAME MILDER AND REACHED AN AGREEMENT, THE SENATE\r\nFOR ITS PART VOTING A REDUCTION IN THEIR DEBTS AND A RELEASE FROM\r\nSEIZURE OF PROPERTY.\r\n\r\nVII, 15.--They feared, however, that when their society had been\r\ndisbanded they might either find the agreements not effectual or might\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 16^6] BE HARMED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR SEPARATION, ONE\r\nBEING PUNISHED ON ONE PRETEXT, ANOTHER ON ANOTHER, in constant\r\nsuccession. So they formed a compact to lend aid to one another in\r\ncase any one of them should be wronged in any particular; and they\r\ntook oaths to this effect and forthwith elected two representatives\r\nfrom their own number (and afterward still more) in order that by such\r\na partnership arrangement they might have assistants and avengers. And\r\nthis they did not only once, but the idea now conceived in this form\r\nkept growing, and they appointed their representatives for a year, as\r\nto some office. The men were called in the tongue of the Latins\r\n_tribunes_ (the commanders of thousands are also so named) but are\r\nstyled _demarchoi_ in the Greek language. In order that the titles of\r\nthe tribuni might be kept distinct they added to the name of the one\r\nclass the phrase \"of the soldiers\" and to that of the other class the\r\nphrase \"of the people.\" These _tribunes of the people_, then, or\r\n_demarchoi_ became responsible for great evils that befell Rome. For\r\nthough they did not immediately secure the title of magistrates, they\r\ngained power beyond all the rest, defending every one that begged\r\nprotection and rescuing every one that called upon them not only from\r\nprivate persons, but from the very magistrates, except the dictators.\r\nIf any one ever invoked them when absent, he, too, was released from\r\nthe person holding him prisoner and was either brought before the\r\npopulace by them or was set free. And if ever they saw fit that\r\nanything should not be done, they prevented it, whether the person\r\nacting were a private citizen or an official: and if the people or the\r\nsenate were about to do or vote anything and a single tribune opposed\r\nit, the action or the vote became null and void. As time went on, they\r\nwere allowed or allowed themselves to summon the senate, to punish\r\nwhoever disobeyed them, to practice divination, and to hold court. And\r\nin case they were refused permission to do anything, they gained their\r\npoint by their incontestable opposition to every project undertaken by\r\nothers. For they introduced laws to the effect that whoever should\r\nobstruct them by deed or word, be he private citizen or magistrate,\r\nshould be \"hallowed\" and incur pollution. This being \"hallowed\" meant\r\ndestruction; for this was the name applied to everything (as, for\r\ninstance, a victim) that was consecrated for slaughter. The tribunes\r\nthemselves were termed by the multitude \"sacrosanct\", since they\r\nobtained sacred enclosures for the shelter of such as invoked them.\r\nFor _sacra_ among the Romans means \"walls\", and _sancta_ \"sacred\".\r\nMany of their actions were unwarrantable, for they threw even consuls\r\ninto prison and put men to death without granting them a hearing.\r\nNobody ventured to oppose them; or, in case any one did, he became\r\nhimself \"hallowed.\" If, however, persons were condemned not by all the\r\ntribunes, they would call to their help those who had not concurred in\r\nthe verdict, and so they went duly through the forms of court\r\nprocedure before the tribunes themselves or before some arbiters or\r\nbefore the populace, and became the possession of the side that won.\r\nIn the course of time the number of the tribunes was fixed at ten,\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 16^7] AND AS A RESULT OF THIS MOST OF THEIR POWER WAS\r\nOVERTHROWN. FOR AS THOUGH BY NATURE (BUT REALLY, OF COURSE, BY REASON\r\nOF JEALOUSY) FELLOW OFFICIALS INVARIABLY QUARREL; AND IT IS DIFFICULT\r\nFOR A NUMBER OF MEN, ESPECIALLY IN A POSITION OF INFLUENCE, TO ATTAIN\r\nHARMONY. No sooner did outsiders, planning to wreck their influence,\r\nraise factional issues to the end that dissension might make them\r\nweaker, than the tribunes actually attached themselves some to one\r\nparty, some to another. [Sidenote: FRAG. 16^7] IF EVEN ONE OF THEM\r\nOPPOSED A MEASURE, he rendered the decisions of the rest null and\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nNow at first they did not enter the senate-house, but sitting at the\r\nentrance watched proceedings, and in case aught failed to please them,\r\nthey would show resistance. Next they were invited inside. Later,\r\nhowever, the ex-tribunes were numbered with the senators, and finally\r\nsome of the senators actually were permitted to be tribunes, unless a\r\nman chanced to be a patrician. Patricians the people would not accept:\r\nhaving chosen the tribunes to defend them against the patricians, and\r\nhaving advanced them to so great power, they dreaded lest one of them\r\nmight turn his strength to contrary purposes and use it against them.\r\nBut if a man abjured the rank given him by birth and changed his\r\nsocial standing to that of a common citizen, they received him gladly.\r\nMany of the patricians whose position was unquestioned renounced their\r\nnobility through desire for the immense influence possible, and so\r\nbecame tribunes.\r\n\r\nSuch was the growth of the domination of the tribunes. In addition to\r\nthem the people chose two aediles, to be their assistants in the matter\r\nof documents. They took charge of everything that was submitted in\r\nwriting to the plebs, to the populace, and to the senate, and kept it,\r\nso that nothing that was done escaped their notice. This and the\r\ntrying of cases were the objects for which they were chosen anciently,\r\nbut later they were charged with the supervision of buying and\r\nselling, whence they came to be called _agoranomoi_ (\"clerks of the\r\nmarket\") by those who put their name into Greek.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 5, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\nVII, 16.--The first revolution of the Romans, then, terminated as\r\ndescribed. Many of the neighboring tribes had found in the revolution\r\na hostile incentive, and the Romans with a unified purpose after their\r\nreconciliation conducted vigorously the wars which the latter waged,\r\nand conquered in all of them. It was at this time that in the siege of\r\nCorioli they came within an ace of being driven from their camp, but a\r\npatrician, Gnaeus Marcius, showed his prowess and repelled the\r\nassailants. For this he received various tokens of renown and was\r\ngiven the title of Coriolanus from the people which he had routed.\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 17^2] FOR THE TIME HE WAS THUS EXALTED BUT NOT LONG\r\nAFTERWARD HE WAS ANXIOUS TO BE MADE PRAETOR AND FAILED, AND THEREFORE\r\nGREW VEXED AT THE POPULACE AND EVINCED DISPLEASURE TOWARD THE\r\nTRIBUNES. HENCE THE TRIBUNES (WHOSE FUNCTIONS HE WAS ESPECIALLY EAGER\r\nTO ABOLISH) HEAPED UP ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HIM AND FIXED UPON HIM A\r\nCHARGE OF AIMING AT TYRANNY AND EXPELLED HIM FROM ROME. HAVING BEEN\r\nEXPELLED HE FORTHWITH BETOOK HIMSELF TO THE VOLSCI. The latter's\r\nleaders and those in authority over them were delighted at his arrival\r\nand again made ready for war; Attius Tullius urged this course upon\r\nthem all, but the people showed lack of enthusiasm. So when the nobles\r\nneither by advice nor by intimidation could prevail upon them to take\r\nup arms, they concocted the following scheme. The Romans were\r\nconducting a horse-race, and the Volsci among other neighboring\r\npeoples had gathered in a large body to behold the spectacle. Tullius,\r\nas a pretended friend of the Romans, persuaded the Roman praetors that\r\nthey should keep watch on the Volsci, since the latter had made ready\r\nto attack them unexpectedly in the midst of the horse-race. The\r\npraetors, after communicating the information to the others, made\r\nproclamation at once, before the contest, that all the Volsci must\r\nretire. The Volsci, indignant because they alone of all the spectators\r\nhad been expelled, put themselves in readiness for battle. Setting at\r\ntheir head Coriolanus and Tullius, and with numbers swollen by the\r\naccession of the Latins, they advanced against Rome. The Romans, when\r\ninformed of it, instead of making a vigorous use of arms fell into\r\nmutual recriminations, the popular party censuring the patricians\r\nbecause Coriolanus, who was campaigning against his country, happened\r\nto belong to their number, and the other party the populace because\r\nthey had been unjust in expelling him and making him an enemy. Because\r\nof this contention they would have incurred some great injury, had not\r\nthe women come to their aid. For when the senate voted restoration to\r\nCoriolanus and envoys had been despatched to him to this end, he\r\ndemanded that the land of which the Volsci had been deprived in the\r\nprevious wars be given back to them. But the people would not\r\nrelinquish the land. Consequence: a second embassy. [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n17^8] AND HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY ANGRY THAT THEY, WHO WERE IN DANGER OF\r\nLOSING THEIR OWN COUNTRY, WOULD NOT EVEN UNDER THESE CONDITIONS\r\nWITHDRAW FROM THE POSSESSIONS OF OTHERS. WHEN THIS SITUATION WAS\r\nREPORTED TO THE DISPUTANTS, THEY STILL REFUSED TO BUDGE, NOR DID THE\r\nDANGERS CAUSE THE MEN, AT LEAST, TO DESIST FROM QUARRELING. BUT THE\r\nWOMEN, VOLUMNIA THE WIFE OF CORIOLANUS AND VETURIA[7] HIS MOTHER,\r\nGATHERING A COMPANY OF THE REMAINING MOST EMINENT LADIES VISITED HIM\r\nIN CAMP AND TOOK HIS CHILDREN ALONG WITH THEM. WHILE THE REST WEPT\r\nWITHOUT SPEAKING VETURIA BEGAN: \"WE ARE NOT DESERTERS, MY SON, BUT THE\r\nCOUNTRY HAS SENT US TO YOU TO BE, IF YOU SHOULD YIELD, YOUR MOTHER,\r\nWIFE AND CHILDREN, BUT OTHERWISE YOUR SPOIL. AND IF EVEN NOW YOU STILL\r\nARE ANGRY, KILL US THE FIRST. BE RECONCILED AND HOLD NO LONGER YOUR\r\nANGER AGAINST YOUR CITIZENS, FRIENDS, TEMPLES, TOMBS; DO NOT TAKE BY\r\nSTORM YOUR NATIVE LAND IN WHICH YOU WERE BORN, WERE REARED, AND BECAME\r\nCORIOLANUS, BEARER OF THIS GREAT NAME. SEND ME NOT HENCE WITHOUT\r\nRESULT, UNLESS YOU WOULD BEHOLD ME DEAD BY MY OWN HAND.\" THEREUPON SHE\r\nSIGHED ALOUD AND SHOWED HER BREASTS AND TOUCHED HER ABDOMEN,\r\nEXCLAIMING: \"THIS BROUGHT YOU FORTH, MY CHILD, THESE REARED YOU UP.\"\r\nSHE, THEN, SAID THIS, AND HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AND THE REST OF THE\r\nWOMEN JOINED IN THE LAMENT, SO THAT HE TOO WAS MOVED TO GRIEF.\r\nRECOVERING HIMSELF WITH DIFFICULTY HE ENFOLDED HIS MOTHER IN HIS ARMS\r\nAND AT THE SAME TIME KISSING HER REPLIED: \"SEE, MOTHER, I YIELD TO\r\nYOU. YOURS IS THE VICTORY, AND TO YOU LET ALL ASCRIBE THIS FAVOR. FOR\r\nI CANNOT ENDURE EVEN TO SEE THEM, WHO AFTER RECEIVING SUCH GREAT\r\nBENEFITS AT MY HANDS HAVE GIVEN ME SUCH A RECOMPENSE, NOR WILL I ENTER\r\nTHE CITY. DO YOU KEEP THE COUNTRY INSTEAD OF ME, BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO\r\nWISHED IT, AND I WILL DEPART.\" HAVING SPOKEN THUS HE WITHDREW. AND HE\r\nDID NOT ACCEPT THE RESTORATION, BUT RETIRED AMONG THE VOLSCI AND THERE\r\nAT AN ADVANCED AGE DEPARTED THIS LIFE.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Zonaras spells it _Veturina_.]\r\n\r\nVII, 17.--Now the tribunes demanded that some land acquired by the\r\nRomans from the enemy be apportioned among the people, and as a result\r\nof their action much damage was incurred by the citizens both from the\r\nenemy and from one another. [Sidenote: FRAG. 19^1] FOR THE NOBLES\r\nBEING UNABLE TO RESTRAIN THEM IN ANY OTHER WAY STIRRED UP PURPOSELY\r\nWARS AFTER WARS, IN ORDER THAT BEING BUSIED THEREWITH THEY MIGHT NOT\r\nDISTURB THEMSELVES ABOUT THE LAND. But after a time some persons began\r\nto suspect what was going on, and would not permit both of the consuls\r\n(or praetors) to be appointed by the nobles, but themselves desired to\r\nchoose one of them from the patricians. Upon effecting this they\r\nselected Spurius Furius, and campaigning with him accomplished with\r\nenthusiasm all objects for which they had set out. But those who took\r\nthe field with his colleague, Fabius Caeso, not only displayed no\r\nenergy, but abandoned their camp, came to the city, and raised a\r\ntumult until the Etruscans, learning of the affair, assailed them.\r\nEven then, moreover, they did not leave the city until some of the\r\ntribunes came to an agreement with the nobles. Still, they fought\r\nvigorously and destroyed many of the enemy, and not a few of\r\ntheir own number also were killed. One of the consuls likewise\r\nfell,--Manlius[8]: the populace chose Manlius[9] praetor for the third\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: This was probably one of the Manlii Cincinnati.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The second \"Manlius\" is evidently an error of Zonaras.\r\nThe name should be _Fabius_.]\r\n\r\nAgain was a war waged against them by the Etruscans. And when the\r\nRomans were in dejection and at a loss to know how they should\r\nwithstand the enemy, the Fabii came to their help. [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n20^1] THEY, THREE HUNDRED AND SIX IN NUMBER, WHEN THEY SAW THAT THE\r\nROMANS WERE DEJECTED, were not following profitable counsels, and were\r\non all points in desperation, took upon themselves the burden of the\r\nwar against the Etruscans, exhibiting readiness to carry on the\r\nconflict by themselves with their persons and with their wealth. They\r\noccupied and fortified an advantageous position from which as a base\r\nthey harried the entire hostile domain, since the Etruscans would not\r\nventure to engage in combat with them, or, if they ever did join\r\nissue, were decisively defeated. But, upon the accession of allies,\r\nthe Etruscans laid an ambuscade in a wooded spot: the Fabii, being\r\nmasters of the whole field, assailed them without [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n20^2] precaution, fell into the snare, were surrounded and all\r\nmassacred. And their race would have entirely disappeared, had not one\r\nof them because of his youth been left at home, in whose descendants\r\nthe family later attained renewed renown.\r\n\r\nAfter the Fabii had been destroyed as related the Romans received\r\nrough treatment at the hands of the Etruscans. Subsequently they\r\nconcluded a peace with the enemy, but turning against one another\r\ncommitted many deeds of outrage, the populace not even refraining\r\nfrom attack upon the praetors. They beat their assistants and shattered\r\ntheir fasces and made the praetors themselves submit to investigation\r\non every pretext, great and small. They actually planned to throw\r\nAppius Claudius into prison in the very midst of his term of office,\r\ninasmuch as he persistently opposed them at every point and had\r\ndecimated the partners of his campaign after their giving way before\r\nthe Volsci in battle. Now decimation was the following sort of\r\nprocess. When the soldiers had committed any grave offence the leader\r\ntold them off in groups of ten and taking one man of each ten (who had\r\ndrawn the lot) he would punish him by death. At Claudius's retirement\r\nfrom office the popular party straightway brought him to trial; and\r\nthough they failed to condemn him, they forced him, by postponing\r\ntheir vote, to commit suicide. And among the measures introduced by\r\nsome of the tribunes to the prejudice of the patrician interests was\r\none permitting the populace to convene separately, and without\r\ninterference from the patricians to deliberate upon and transact as\r\nmuch business as they pleased. They also ordained that, if any one for\r\nany cause should have a penalty imposed upon him by the praetors, the\r\npopulace might thereupon have the case appealed to them and decide it.\r\nAnd they increased the number of aediles and of tribunes, in order to\r\nhave a large body of persons to act as their representatives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 21^1] DURING THE PROGRESS OF THESE EVENTS THE\r\nPATRICIANS OPENLY TOOK SCARCELY ANY RETALIATORY MEASURES, EXCEPT IN A\r\nFEW CASES, BUT SECRETLY SLAUGHTERED A NUMBER OF THE BOLDEST SPIRITS.\r\nNEITHER THIS, HOWEVER, NOR THE FACT THAT ON ONE OCCASION NINE TRIBUNES\r\nWERE DELIVERED TO THE FLAMES BY THE POPULACE SEEMED TO RESTRAIN THE\r\nREST. NOT ONLY WERE THOSE WHO SUBSEQUENTLY HELD THE TRIBUNESHIP NOT\r\nCALMED, BUT ACTUALLY THEY WERE THE RATHER EMBOLDENED. [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n21^2] THIS WAS THE CONDITION INTO WHICH THE PATRICIANS BROUGHT THE\r\nPOPULACE. AND THEY WOULD NOT OBEY THE SUMMONS TO GO ON A CAMPAIGN,\r\nTHOUGH THE FOE ASSAILED, UNLESS THEY SECURED THE OBJECTS FOR WHICH\r\nTHEY WERE STRIVING, AND IF THEY EVER DID TAKE THE FIELD, THEY FOUGHT\r\nLISTLESSLY, UNLESS THEY HAD ACCOMPLISHED ALL THAT THEY DESIRED. HENCE\r\nMANY OF THE TRIBES LIVING CLOSE TO THEM, RELYING ON EITHER THE\r\nDISSENSION OF THEIR FOES OR THEIR OWN STRENGTH, RAISED THE STANDARD OF\r\nREVOLT. [Sidenote: FRAG. 22^1] AMONG THESE WERE ALSO THE AEQUI, WHO,\r\nAFTER CONQUERING AT THIS TIME MARCUS MINUCIUS WHILE HE SERVED AS\r\nPRAETOR, BECAME PRESUMPTUOUS. [Sidenote: FRAG. 22^2] THOSE AT ROME,\r\nLEARNING THAT MINUCIUS HAD BEEN DEFEATED, CHOSE AS DICTATOR LUCIUS\r\nQUINCTIUS, WHO WAS A POOR MAN AND HAD DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO FARMING, BUT\r\nWAS DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS VALOR AND WISE MODERATION; AND HE LET HIS\r\nHAIR GROW IN CURLS, WHENCE HE WAS NAMED CINCINNATUS.[10] He, being\r\nselected as dictator, took the field that very day, used wariness as\r\nwell as speed, and simultaneously with Minucius attacked the AEqui,\r\nkilling very many of them and capturing the rest alive: the latter he\r\nled under the yoke and then released. This matter of the yoke I shall\r\nbriefly describe. The Romans used to fix in the ground two poles\r\n(upright wooden beams, of course, with a space between them) and\r\nacross them they would lay another transverse beam; through the frame\r\nthus formed they led the captives naked. This conferred great\r\ndistinction upon the side that conducted the operation but vast\r\ndishonor upon the side that endured it, so that some preferred to die\r\nrather than submit to any such treatment. Cincinnatus also captured a\r\ncity of theirs called Corvinum[11] and returned: he removed Minucius\r\nfrom his praetorship because of his defeat, and himself resigned his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Zonaras spells _Cicinatus_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The town is called _Corbio_ by Livy (II, 39, 4).]\r\n\r\nVII, 18.--The Romans, however, now got another war on their hands at\r\nhome, in which their adversaries were composed of slaves and some\r\nexiles who moved unexpectedly by night and secured possession of the\r\nCapitol. This time, too, the multitude did not arm themselves for the\r\nfray till they had wrung some further concessions from the patricians.\r\nThen they assailed the revolutionists and overcame them, but lost many\r\nof their own men.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, accordingly, and because of certain portents the\r\nRomans became sobered and dismissed their mutual grievances and voted\r\nto establish the rights of citizenship on a fairer basis. And they\r\nsent three men to Greece with an eye to the laws and the customs of\r\nthe people there. Upon the return of the commission they abolished all\r\nthe political offices, including that of the tribunes, and chose\r\ninstead eight of the foremost men, and [Sidenote: B.C. 451 (_a.u._\r\n303)] designated Appius Claudius and Titus Genucius praetors with\r\ndictatorial powers for that one year. They empowered them to compile\r\nlaws and further voted that no case could be appealed from them,--a\r\nlatitude granted previously to none of the magistrates save the\r\ndictators. These men held sway each for a day, assuming by turns the\r\ndignity of rulership. They compiled laws and exposed the same to view\r\nin the Forum. These statutes being found pleasing to all were put\r\nbefore the people, and after receiving their ratification were\r\ninscribed on ten tablets; for all records that were deemed worthy of\r\nsafekeeping used to be preserved on tablets.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 450 (_a.u._ 304)] The above mentioned magistrates at\r\nthe expiration of the year surrendered their office, but ten more\r\nchosen anew (for the overthrow of the State, as it almost seemed) came\r\nto grief. They all held sway at once on equal terms and chose from\r\namong the patricians some most brazen youths, through whom, as their\r\nagents, they committed many acts of violence. At last, toward the end\r\nof the year, they compiled a few additional statutes written upon two\r\ntablets, all of which were the product of their own individual\r\njudgment. From these not harmony, but greater disputes, were destined\r\nto fall to the lot of the Romans.\r\n\r\nThe so-called twelve tablets were thus created at that time. But\r\nbesides doing this the lawgivers in question, when their year of\r\noffice had expired, still maintained control of affairs, occupying the\r\ncity by force; and they would not convene the senate nor the people,\r\nlest, if they came together, they should depose them. And when the\r\nAEqui and the Sabines now stirred up war against the Romans, these\r\nofficials by arrangement with their adherents gained their object of\r\nhaving the conduct of the wars entrusted to them. Of the decemvirate\r\nServius Oppius and Appius Claudius remained at home: the other eight\r\nset out against the enemy.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely all [Sidenote: FRAG. 22^3] THE INTERESTS, however, OF STATE\r\nAND CAMP ALIKE WERE THROWN INTO CONFUSION, AND HENCE CONTENTION AGAIN\r\nAROSE. The leaders of the force had invaded the land of the Sabines\r\nand sent a certain Lucius Sicius, who was accounted a strong tower in\r\nwarfare and likewise one of the most prominent representatives of the\r\npopulace, with companions, avowedly to seize a certain position; but\r\nthey had the man slain by the party that had been sent out with him.\r\nThe report was brought into camp that the man with others had been\r\nkilled by the foe, and the soldiers went out to gather up the dead\r\nbodies. They found not one corpse belonging to the enemy but many of\r\ntheir own race, whom Sicius had killed in his own defence when they\r\nattacked him. And when they saw that the dead were lying all around\r\nhim and had their faces turned toward him, they suspected what had\r\nbeen done and furthermore raised a tumult.--There was still another\r\nincident that had a bearing on the situation.\r\n\r\nLucius Virginius, a man of the people, had a daughter of surpassing\r\nbeauty whom he intended to bestow in marriage upon Lucius Icilius,[12]\r\na person of similar rank in society. For this maiden Claudius\r\nconceived a passion, and not otherwise able to attain his ends he\r\narranged with certain men to declare her a slave: he was to be the\r\narbiter. The father of the girl accordingly came from the camp and\r\npled his case. When Claudius had given sentence against her and the\r\ngirl was delivered to those who had declared her a slave and no one\r\ncame to the rescue, her father wild with grief took a cleaver and\r\nended his daughter's life and, just as he was, rushed out to the\r\nsoldiers. They, who had been previously far from tractable, were so\r\nwrought up that they straightway set out in haste against the city to\r\nfind Claudius. And the rest, who had gone on a campaign against the\r\nSabines, when they learned this abandoned their intrenchments, and,\r\njoining with the rest, set at their head twenty men, determined to\r\naccomplish something of importance. The remainder of the multitude in\r\nthe city likewise espoused their cause and added to the tumult.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Zonaras spells _Icillius_.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Claudius in terror had hidden himself and Oppius convened\r\nthe senate; and sending to the populace he enquired what they wanted.\r\nThey demanded that Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius, two of the\r\nsenators who favored their cause, be sent to them, saying that through\r\nthese men they would make their reply. Owing to the fear of the ten\r\nmagistrates (for they were now all on the scene) that the people would\r\nemploy the two as leaders against them they were not sent, whereupon\r\nthe populace grew still more angry. As a consequence the senators were\r\ninspired with no slight fear and against the will of the magistrates\r\nthey sent Valerius and Horatius to the people. By this means a\r\nreconciliation was effected: the rioters were granted immunity for\r\ntheir acts, and the decemvirate was abolished; the annual\r\nmagistracies, including that of tribunes, were restored with the same\r\nprivileges as they had formerly enjoyed. Virginius was one of the\r\nmagistrates appointed; and they cast into prison Oppius and Claudius\r\n(who committed suicide before their cases were investigated), and\r\nindicted, convicted, and banished the remainder of the board.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 449 (_a.u._ 305)] VII, 19.--Now the consuls--it is\r\nsaid that this is the first time they were known as consuls, being\r\npreviously called praetors; and they were Valerius and Horatius--both\r\nthen and thereafter showed favor to the populace and strengthened\r\ntheir cause rather than that of the patricians. The patricians, though\r\nsubdued, would not readily convene and did not put matters entirely in\r\nthe power of the lower class, but granted the tribunes the right of\r\npracticing augury in their assemblies: nominally this was an honor and\r\ndignity for them, since from very ancient times this privilege had\r\nbeen accorded the patricians alone, but really it was a hindrance. The\r\nnobles intended that the tribunes and the populace should not\r\naccomplish easily everything they pleased, but should sometimes be\r\nprevented under this plea of augury. The patricians as well as the\r\nsenate were displeased at the consuls, whom they regarded as favorable\r\nto the popular cause, and so did not vote a triumph to them--though\r\neach had won a war--and did not assign to each a day as had been the\r\ncustom. The populace, however, both held a festival for two days and\r\nvoted triumphal honors to the consuls.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 6, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 448 (_a.u._ 306)] When the Romans thus fell into\r\ndiscord their adversaries took courage and came against them. It was\r\nin the following year, when Marcus Genucius and Gaius Curtius were\r\nconsuls, that they turned against each other. The popular leaders\r\ndesired to be consuls, since the patricians were in the habit of\r\nbecoming tribunes by transference to their order, and the patricians\r\nclung tenaciously to the consular office. They indulged in many words\r\nand acts of violence against each other. But in order to prevent the\r\npopulace from proceeding to greater extremities the nobles yielded to\r\nthem the substance of authority though they would not relinquish the\r\nname; and in place of the consuls they named military tribunes in\r\norder that the honor of the title might not be sullied by contact with\r\nthe vulgar throng. It was agreed that three military tribunes be\r\nchosen from each of the classes in place of the two consuls. However,\r\nthe name of consul was not lost entirely, but sometimes consuls were\r\nappointed and at other times military tribunes. This, at all events,\r\nis the tradition that has come down of what took place, with the\r\nadditional detail that the consuls nominated dictators, though their\r\nown powers were far inferior to those appertaining to that office, and\r\neven that the military tribunes likewise did so sometimes. It is\r\nfurther said that none of the military tribunes, though many of them\r\nwon many victories, ever celebrated a triumph.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 447 (_a.u._ 307)] It was in this way, then, that\r\nmilitary tribunes came to be chosen at that time: censors were\r\nappointed in the following year, during the consulship of Barbatus and\r\nMarcus Macrinus. Those chosen were Lucius Papirius and Lucius\r\nSempronius. The reason for their election was that the consuls were\r\nunable, on account of the number of the people, to supervise them all;\r\nthe duties now assigned to the censors had until that time been\r\nperformed by the consuls as a part of their prerogatives. Two was the\r\noriginal number of the censors and they were taken from the\r\npatricians. They held office at first and at the last for five-year\r\nperiods, but during the intervening time for three half-years; and\r\nthey came to be greater than the consuls, though they had taken over\r\nonly a part of their functions. They had the right to let the public\r\nrevenues, to supervise roads and public buildings, to make complete\r\nrecords of each man's wealth, and to note and investigate the lives of\r\nthe citizens, enrolling those deserving of praise in the tribes, in\r\nthe equestrian order, or in the senate (as seemed to fit the case of\r\neach one), and similarly erasing from any class the names of those who\r\nwere not right livers: this power was greater than all those now left\r\nto the consuls. They made declarations attested by oath, in regard to\r\nevery one of their acts, that no such act was prompted by favor or by\r\nenmity but that their considerations and performances were both the\r\nresult of an unbiased opinion of what was advantageous for the\r\ncommonwealth. They convened the people when laws were to be introduced\r\nand for other purposes, and employed all the insignia of the greater\r\noffices save lictors. Such, at its inception, was the office of the\r\ncensors. If any persons did not register their property and themselves\r\nin the census lists, the censors sold the property and the consuls the\r\nmen. This arrangement held for a certain time, but later it was\r\ndetermined that a man once enrolled in the senate should be a senator\r\nfor life and that his name should not be erased, unless one had been\r\ndisgraced by being tried for the commission of a crime or was\r\nconvicted of leading an evil life: the names of such persons were\r\nerased and others inscribed in their stead.\r\n\r\nIn the case of those who gave satisfaction in office principal honors\r\nwere bestowed upon dictators, honors of the second rank upon censors,\r\nand third place was awarded to masters of horse. This system was\r\nfollowed without distinction, whether they were still in office or\r\nwhether they had already laid it down. For if one descended from a\r\ngreater office to an inferior one, he still kept the dignity of his\r\nformer position intact. One particular man, whom they styled\r\n_principa_ of the senate (he would be called _prokritos_ by the\r\nGreeks) was preferred before all for the time that he was president (a\r\nperson was not chosen for this position for life) and surpassed the\r\nrest in dignity, without wielding, however, any power.\r\n\r\nVII, 20.--For a time they maintained peace with each other and with\r\nthe adjacent tribes, but then a famine mastered them, so severe that\r\nsome not able to endure the pangs of hunger threw themselves into the\r\nriver, and they fell to quarreling. The one class blamed the\r\nprosperous as being at fault in the handling of the grain, and the\r\nother class blamed the poorer men for unwillingness to till the soil.\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 439 (_a.u._ 315)] Spurius Maelius, a wealthy knight,\r\nseeing this attempted to set up a tyranny, and buying corn from the\r\nneighboring region he lowered the price of it for many and gave it\r\nfree to many others. In this way he won the friendship of a great many\r\nand procured arms and guardsmen. And he would have gained control of\r\nthe city, had not Minucius Augurinus, a patrician, appointed to have\r\ncharge of the grain distribution and censured for the lack of grain,\r\nreported the proceeding to the senate. The senate on receiving the\r\ninformation nominated at once and at that very meeting Lucius\r\nQuinctius Cincinnatus, though past his prime (he was eighty years\r\nold), to be dictator. They spent the whole day sitting there, as if\r\nengaged in some discussion, to prevent news of their action from\r\ntraveling abroad. By night the dictator had the knights occupy in\r\nadvance the Capitol and the remaining points of vantage, and at dawn\r\nhe sent to Maelius Gaius Servilius, master of the horse, to summon him\r\npretendedly on some other errand. But as Maelius had some suspicions\r\nand delayed, Servilius fearing that he might be rescued by the\r\npopulace--for they were already running together--killed the man\r\neither on his own responsibility or because ordered to do so by the\r\ndictator. At this the populace broke into a riot, but Quinctius\r\nharangued them and by providing them with grain and refraining from\r\npunishing or accusing any one else he stopped the riot.\r\n\r\nWars with various nations now assailed the Romans, in some of which\r\nthey were victorious within a few days; but with the Etruscans they\r\nwaged a long continued contest. Postumius conquered the AEqui and had\r\ncaptured a large city of theirs, but the soldiers neither had had it\r\nturned over to them for pillage nor were awarded a share of the\r\nplunder when they requested it. Therefore they surrounded and slew the\r\nquaestor who was disposing of it, and when Postumius reprimanded them\r\nfor this and strove to find the assassins, they killed him also. And\r\nthey assigned to their own use not only the captive territory but all\r\nthat at the time happened to be found in the public treasury. The\r\nuprising would have assumed even greater dimensions but for the fact\r\nthat war against the Romans was renewed by the AEqui. Alarmed by this\r\nsituation they became quiet, endured the punishment for the murders,\r\nwhich touched only a few, and took the field against their opponents,\r\nwhom they engaged and conquered. For this achievement the nobles\r\ndistributed the plunder among them, and voted pay first to the\r\ninfantry and later also to the cavalry. Up to that time they were used\r\nto undertaking campaigns without pay and lived at their own expense;\r\nnow for the first time they began to draw pay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 408 (_a.u._ 346)] A war arising between them and Veii,\r\nthe Romans won frequent victories and reduced the foe to a state of\r\nsiege as long as the latter fought with merely their own contingent:\r\nbut when allies had been added to their force they came out against\r\nthe Romans and defeated them. Meanwhile the lake situated close to the\r\nAlban Mount, which was shut in by the surrounding ridges and had no\r\noutlet, overflowed its banks during the siege of Veii to such an\r\nextent that it actually poured over the crests of the hills and went\r\nrushing down to the sea. The Romans deeming that something\r\nsupernatural was certainly signified by this event sent to Delphi to\r\nconsult the oracle about the matter. There was also among the\r\npopulation of Veii an Etruscan who was a soothsayer. The Pythian\r\ninterpretation coincided with his; and both declared that the city\r\nwould be captured when the overflowing water should not fall into the\r\nsea but be used up differently. The Romans consequently ordered\r\nseveral religious services to be performed. But the Pythian god did\r\nnot specify to which of the divinities nor in what way they should\r\noffer these, and the Etruscan appeared to have the knowledge but would\r\nexplain nothing. So the Romans who were stationed about the wall from\r\nwhich he was wont to issue to consort with them pretended friendliness\r\ntoward him, permitted him to make himself at ease in every way, and\r\nallowed him to come to visit them without interference. Thus they\r\nsucceeded in seizing him and forced him to give all the requisite\r\ninformation. According to the indications he furnished they offered\r\nsacrifices, tunneled the hill, and conducted the superfluous water by\r\na secret canal into the plain, so that all of it was used up there and\r\nnone ran down into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 7, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\nVII, 24.--A certain Marcus Fabius, a patrician, who chanced to be the\r\nfather of two daughters, betrothed the elder to a Licinius Stolo, much\r\ninferior to him in rank, and married the younger to Sulpicius Rufus,\r\nwho belonged to his own class. [Sidenote: FRAG. 27^1] NOW WHILE RUFUS\r\nWAS MILITARY TRIBUNE, ONCE WHEN HE WAS IN THE FORUM HIS WIFE HAD A\r\nVISIT FROM HER SISTER. AT THE ARRIVAL OF THE HUSBAND THE LICTOR,\r\nACCORDING TO SOME ANCIENT CUSTOM, KNOCKED AT THE DOOR. THE CLATTER\r\nSTARTLED THE WOMAN, WHO WAS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROCEDURE:\r\nTHEREUPON BOTH HER SISTER AND THE OTHERS PRESENT BURST OUT LAUGHING\r\nAND SHE WAS MADE FUN OF AS A SIMPLETON. SHE TOOK THE MATTER AS A\r\nSERIOUS AFFRONT AND ROUSED HER HUSBAND TO CANVASS FOR OFFICE. Stolo,\r\naccordingly, incited by his wife, confided his intentions to Lucius\r\nSextius, one of his peers, and both forced their way into the\r\ntribuneship; they thus overturned the good order of the State to such\r\nan extent that for four years the people had no rulers, since these\r\nmen repeatedly obstructed the patrician elections. This state of\r\naffairs would have continued for a still longer time, had not news\r\nbeen brought that the Celtae were again marching upon Rome.\r\n\r\nVII, 25.--It is related that after this a disaster befell Rome. The\r\nlevel land between the Palatine and the Capitoline is said to have\r\nbecome suddenly a yawning gulf, without any preceding earthquake or\r\nother phenomenon such as usually takes place in nature on the occasion\r\nof such developments. For a long time the chasm remained _in statu\r\nquo_, and neither closed up in the slightest degree nor was to be\r\nfilled, albeit the Romans brought and cast into it masses of earth and\r\nstones and all sorts of other material. In the midst of the Romans'\r\nuncertainty an oracle was given them to the effect that the aperture\r\ncould in no way be closed except they should throw into the chasm\r\ntheir best possession and that which was the chief source of their\r\nstrength: then the thing would cease, and the city should command\r\npower inextinguishable. Still the uncertainty remained unresolved, for\r\nthe oracle was obscure. But Marcus Curtius, a patrician, young in\r\nyears, of a remarkably beautiful appearance, powerful physique, and\r\ncourageous spirit, conspicuous also for intelligence, comprehended the\r\nmeaning of the oracle. He came forward before them all and addressed\r\nthem, saying: \"Why, Romans, convict the revelation of obscurity or\r\nourselves of ignorance? We are the thing sought and debated. For\r\nnothing lifeless may be counted better than what has life, nor shall\r\nthat which has comprehension and prudence and the adornment of speech\r\nfail of preference before what is uncomprehending, speechless and\r\nsenseless. What should any one deem superior to Man to be cast into\r\nthe earth-fissure, that therewith we might contract it? [Sidenote:\r\nFRAG. 28^2] THERE IS NO MORTAL CREATURE EITHER BETTER OR STRONGER THAN\r\nMAN. FOR, IF ONE MAY SPEAK SOMEWHAT BOLDLY, MAN IS NAUGHT ELSE THAN A\r\nGOD WITH MORTAL BODY, AND A GOD NAUGHT ELSE THAN A MAN WITHOUT BODY\r\nAND THEREFORE IMMORTAL, and we are not far sundered from divine Power.\r\nThis, to my mind, is the matter and I urge you also to adhere to this\r\nview. May no one think that I shall have recourse to the lot or bid\r\nmaiden or lad lose a life. I myself willingly bestow myself upon you,\r\nthat you may send me this very day as herald and envoy to the cthonian\r\ngods, to be your representative and helper forever.\" At the close of\r\nthese words Curtius proceeded to put on his armor and then mounted his\r\nhorse. The rest grew mad with grief and mad with joy; they came\r\nflocking with adornments, and some adorned the man himself with them\r\nas a hero, and others threw some of them into the chasm. Scarcely had\r\nCurtius sprung into it fully mounted, when the earth-fissure was\r\nclosed and no one ever again beheld either the chasm or Curtius. This\r\nis the way the story is related by the Romans. Should any person judge\r\nit fabulous and not to be credited, he has the right to pay no\r\nattention to it.\r\n\r\nAnd again wars were waged against the Romans both by Gauls and by\r\nother nations, but they repelled all invaders, voting now for consuls,\r\nnow for dictators. Whereupon somewhat of the following nature took\r\nplace. Lucius Camillus was named dictator, as the Gauls were\r\noverrunning the environs of Rome. He proceeded against the barbarians\r\nwith the intention of using up time and not risking the issue in\r\nconflict with men animated by desperation: he expected to exhaust them\r\nmore easily and securely by the failure of provisions. And a Gaul\r\nchallenged the Romans to furnish a champion for a duel. His opponent,\r\naccordingly, was Marcus Valerius, a military tribune, a grandson of\r\nthe famous Maximus. The course of the battle was brilliant on both\r\nsides: the Roman excelled in cleverness and an unusual mastery of his\r\nart, and the Gaul in strength and daring. It was regarded as still\r\nmore marvelous that a crow lighted on the helmet of Valerius and\r\ncawing all the time made dashes at the barbarian, confusing his sight\r\nand impeding his onset until he finally received a finishing blow. The\r\nGauls, consequently, indignant at being beaten by a bird, in a rage\r\nclosed at once with the Romans and suffered a severe defeat. From the\r\nincident of the crow's assistance Valerius obtained the further name\r\nof Corvinus.\r\n\r\nThereafter, as the armies began to grow insubordinate and a civil war\r\nthreatened to break out, the insurgents were brought to terms by the\r\nenactment of laws that no one's name should be erased from the lists\r\nagainst his will, that any person who had served as tribune of the\r\nsoldiers should not be centurion, that both of the consuls might\r\nbelong to and be appointed from the people, and that the same man\r\nshould not hold two offices at the same time nor hold the same office\r\ntwice within ten years.\r\n\r\nVII, 26.--Now the Latins, although under treaty with the Romans,\r\nrevolted and provoked a conflict. They were filled with pride for the\r\nreason that they had an abundance of youthful warriors and were\r\npracticed in the details of warfare as a result of the constant\r\ncampaigning with the Romans. The other side, understanding the\r\nsituation, chose Torquatus consul for the third time and likewise\r\nDecius, and came out to meet them. They fought a fierce battle, each\r\nparty thinking that that day was a precise test of their fortune and\r\nof their valor. A certain event seemed to give the battle added\r\ndistinction. The consuls, seeing that the Latins were equipped and\r\nspoke like the Romans, feared that some of the soldiers might make\r\nmistakes through not distinguishing their own and the hostile force\r\nwith entire ease. Therefore they made proclamation to their men to\r\nobserve instructions carefully and in no case to fight an isolated\r\ncombat with any of the antagonists. Most observed this injunction, but\r\nthe son of Torquatus, who was on the field among the cavalry and had\r\nbeen sent to reconnoitre the enemy's position, transgressed it not\r\nthrough wilfulness but rather through ambition. The leader of the\r\nLatin horse saw him approaching and challenged him to a championship\r\ncontest; and when the youth would not accept the challenge on account\r\nof the notice that had been served, the other provoked him, saying:\r\n\"Are you not the son of Torquatus? Do you not give yourself airs with\r\nyour father's collar? Are you strong and courageous against those\r\nlow-lived Gauls but fear us Latins? Where, then, do you find your\r\nright to rule? Why do you give orders to us as your inferiors?\"--The\r\nRoman became frenzied with rage and readily forgot the injunction: he\r\nwon the combat, and in high spirits conveyed the spoils to his father.\r\nThe latter, after assembling the army, said: \"Nobly you have fought,\r\nmy child, and for this I will crown you. But because you did not\r\nobserve the orders issued, though under obligation both as a son and\r\nas a soldier to yield obedience, [Sidenote: FRAG. 32^2] FOR THIS\r\nREASON I SHALL EXECUTE YOU, THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN BOTH THE PRIZE FOR\r\nYOUR PROWESS AND THE PENALTY FOR YOUR DISOBEDIENCE.\" Having spoken\r\nthese words he at the same moment placed the garland on his head and\r\ncut off the very head that bore it.\r\n\r\nSoon after, a dream that appeared to both consuls the same night, of\r\nidentical import in each case, seemed to tell them that they should\r\novercome the enemy, if one of the consuls should devote himself.\r\nDiscussing the dream together in the daytime, they decided that it was\r\nof divine origin, and agreed that it must be obeyed. And they disputed\r\nwith each other, not as to which should be saved, but as to which of\r\nthem preferably should devote himself: they even presented their\r\narguments before the foremost men in camp. Finally they settled it\r\nthat one should station himself on the right wing and the other on the\r\nleft, and that whichever of those two divisions should be defeated,\r\nthe consul stationed there should give up his life. There was so much\r\nrivalry between them in regard to the self-devotion that each of the\r\nconsuls prayed that he might be defeated, in order to obtain the right\r\nto devote himself and the consequent glory. After joining battle with\r\nthe Latins they carried on a closely contested fight for a long time,\r\nbut finally Decius's wing gave way before the Latins a little. On\r\nperceiving this Decius devoted himself. Slipping off his armor he put\r\non his purple-bordered clothing. Some say that in this costume he\r\nsprang upon a horse and rode toward the enemy and met his death at\r\ntheir hands, others that he was slain by a fellow-soldier of his own\r\nrace. A short time after Decius had perished a decisive victory fell\r\nto the lot of the Romans and the Latins were all routed, yet\r\ncertainly not on account of the death of Decius. [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n32^4] FOR HOW CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT FROM SUCH A DEATH OF ONE MAN SO\r\nGREAT A MULTITUDE OF HUMAN BEINGS WAS DESTROYED ON THE ONE SIDE AND ON\r\nTHE OTHER WAS SAVED AND WON A CONSPICUOUS VICTORY? So the Latins in\r\nthis way were defeated, [Sidenote: FRAG. 32^6] AND TORQUATUS, THOUGH\r\nHE HAD KILLED HIS SON AND THOUGH HIS COLLEAGUE HAD LOST HIS LIFE,\r\nNEVERTHELESS CELEBRATED A TRIUMPH.\r\n\r\nOnce again did they subdue these very Latins, who had revolted, and\r\nthey subjugated in battle other nations, employing now consuls and now\r\ndictators.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 8, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\nOne of the latter was Lucius Papirius, also called Cursor from his\r\nphysical condition (he was a very fleet runner) and on account of his\r\npracticing running. After this Papirius as dictator with Fabius Rullus\r\nas master of the horse was sent out against the Samnites and by\r\ndefeating them compelled them to agree to such terms as he wished. But\r\nwhen he had resigned his leadership they again arose in arms. They\r\nwere attacked anew by the dictator Aulus Cornelius, [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n33^3] AND BEING DEFEATED MADE PROPOSALS OF PEACE TO THE MEN AT ROME.\r\nTHEY SENT THEM ALL THE CAPTIVES THAT THEY HAD, AND ASCRIBED THE\r\nRESPONSIBILITY FOR THE WAR TO RUTULUS, A MAN OF INFLUENCE AMONG THEM.\r\nHIS BONES, SINCE HE ANTICIPATED THEM IN COMMITTING SUICIDE, THEY\r\nSCATTERED ABROAD. YET THEY DID NOT OBTAIN THEIR PEACE, BEING ACCOUNTED\r\nUNTRUSTWORTHY; BUT THE VICTORS, THOUGH ACCEPTING THE PRISONERS, VOTED\r\nFOR RELENTLESS WAR AGAINST THEM. [Sidenote: FRAG. 33^4] THE ROMANS,\r\nTHEN, EXPECTING IN THEIR EXTREME ARROGANCE THAT THEY SHOULD CAPTURE\r\nTHEM ALL AT THE FIRST BLOW, SUCCUMBED TO A TERRIBLE DISASTER. THE\r\nSAMNITES, BEING BADLY FRIGHTENED AND THINKING THE REFUSAL TO MAKE\r\nPEACE A CALAMITY, FOUGHT WITH DESPERATION; AND BY PLANTING AN\r\nAMBUSCADE IN A NARROW SPOT RATHER CLOSELY HEMMED IN BY HILLS THEY BOTH\r\nCAPTURED THE CAMP AND SEIZED ALIVE THE WHOLE FORCE OF THE ROMANS, ALL\r\nOF WHOM THEY SENT UNDER THE YOKE.--What the operation of the yoke was\r\nhas already been described by me above.[13]--However, they killed not\r\na man but took away their arms and horses and everything else they had\r\nsave one garment, and released them thus stripped of possessions under\r\nan agreement that they should leave Samnite territory and be their\r\nallies on an equal footing. In order to insure the articles of the\r\nagreement being ratified also by the senate, they retained six hundred\r\nof the knights to serve as hostages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Near the end of VII, 17.]\r\n\r\nThe consuls Spurius Postumius and Tiberius Calvinus with their army\r\nimmediately withdrew, and at night they and the most notable of the\r\nrest of the force entered Rome, while the remaining soldiers scattered\r\nthrough the country districts. [Sidenote: FRAG. 33^9] THE MEN IN THE\r\nCITY ON HEARING OF THE EVENT DID NOT FIND IT POSSIBLE EITHER TO BE\r\nPLEASED AT THE SURVIVAL OF THEIR SOLDIERS OR TO BE DISPLEASED. WHEN\r\nTHEY THOUGHT OF THE CALAMITY THEIR GRIEF WAS EXTREME, AND THE FACT\r\nTHAT THEY HAD SUFFERED SUCH A REVERSE AT THE HANDS OF THE SAMNITES\r\nINCREASED THEIR GRIEF; WHEN THEY STOPPED TO REFLECT, HOWEVER, THAT IF\r\nIT HAD COME TO PASS THAT ALL HAD PERISHED, ALL THEIR INTERESTS WOULD\r\nHAVE BEEN ENDANGERED, THEY WERE REALLY PLEASED AT THE SURVIVAL OF\r\nTHEIR OWN MEN. But concealing for a time their pleasure they went into\r\nmourning and carried on no business in the everyday fashion either at\r\nonce or subsequently, as long as they had control of affairs. The\r\nconsuls they deposed forthwith, chose others in their stead, and took\r\ncounsel about the situation. And they determined not to accept the\r\narrangement; but since it was impossible to take this action without\r\nthrowing the responsibility upon the men who had conducted the\r\nnegotiations, they hesitated on the one hand to condemn the consuls\r\nand the rest who, associated with the latter in their capacity as\r\nholders of certain offices, had made the peace, and they hesitated on\r\nthe other hand to acquit them, since by so doing they would bring the\r\nbreach of faith home to themselves. Accordingly they made these very\r\nconsuls participate in their deliberations and they asked Postumius\r\nfirst of all for his opinion, that he might state separately his\r\nsentiments touching his own case, and the shame of having disgrace\r\nattach to all of them be avoided. So he came forward and said that\r\ntheir acts ought not to be ratified by the senate and the people,\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 33^11] FOR THEY THEMSELVES HAD NOT ACTED OF THEIR OWN\r\nFREE WILL, BUT UNDER THE COMPULSION OF A NECESSITY which the enemy had\r\nbrought upon them not through valor but through craft and ambuscade.\r\nNow men who had practiced deception could not, if they were deceived\r\nin turn, have any just complaint against those who turned the tables\r\non them. When he had finished saying this and considerable more of the\r\nsame nature, the senate found itself at a loss how to act: but as\r\nPostumius and Calvinus took the burden of responsibility upon their\r\nown shoulders, it was voted that the agreements should not be ratified\r\nand that these men should be delivered up.\r\n\r\nBoth the consuls, therefore, and the remaining officials who had been\r\npresent when oaths were taken were conducted back to Samnium.\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 33^14] THE SAMNITES, HOWEVER, WOULD NOT ACCEPT THEM,\r\nBUT DEMANDED BACK ALL THE CAPTIVES, AND INVOKED THE GODS AND CONJURED\r\nTHEM BY THE DIVINE POWER, AND FINALLY THEY DISMISSED THE MEN THAT HAD\r\nBEEN SURRENDERED. The Romans were glad enough to get them back, but\r\nwere angry at the Samnites WHOM THEY ATTACKED IN BATTLE AND\r\nVANQUISHED, AFTER WHICH THEY ACCORDED THEM A SIMILAR TREATMENT, FOR\r\nTHEY SENT THEM UNDER THE YOKE IN TURN AND RELEASED THEM without\r\ninflicting any other injury. They also got possession of their own\r\nknights, who were being held by the Samnites as hostages and were\r\nunharmed.\r\n\r\nVIII, 1.--After a long interval the Romans under the leadership of\r\nGaius Junius were again warring with the Samnites, when they met with\r\ndisaster. While Junius was pillaging the hostile territory, the\r\nSamnites conveyed their possessions into the Avernian[14] woods,\r\nso-called from the fact that on account of the closeness of the trees\r\nno bird flies into them. Being there ensconced they set out some herds\r\nwithout herdsmen or guards and quietly sent some pretended deserters\r\nwho guided the Romans to the booty apparently lying at their disposal.\r\nBut when the latter had entered the wood, the Samnites surrounded them\r\nand did not cease from slaughter till they were completely tired out.\r\nAnd though the Samnites fought on many other occasions against the\r\nRomans and were defeated, they would not be quiet, but having acquired\r\nthe Gauls, besides others, as allies, they made preparations to march\r\nupon Rome itself. The Romans, when they learned of it, fell into\r\nalarm, for their original inclination to do so was augmented by many\r\nportents. On the Capitol blood is reported to have issued for three\r\ndays from the altar of Jupiter, together with honey on one day, and\r\nmilk on a second--if anybody can believe it: and in the Forum a\r\nbronze statue of Victory set upon a stone pedestal was found standing\r\nupon the ground below, without any one's having moved it; and, as it\r\nhappened, it was facing in that direction from which the Gauls were\r\nalready approaching. This of itself was enough to terrify the\r\npopulace, who were even more dismayed by ill-omened interpretations\r\npublished by the seers. However, a certain Manius, by birth an\r\nEtruscan, encouraged them by declaring that Victory, even if she had\r\ndescended, had gone forward, and being now settled more firmly on the\r\nground indicated to them mastery in the war. Accordingly, many\r\nsacrifices, too, should be offered to the gods; for their altars, and\r\nparticularly those on the Capitol, where they sacrifice\r\nthank-offerings for victory, were regularly stained with blood in the\r\nmidst of their successes and not in their disasters. From these\r\ndevelopments, then, he persuaded them to expect some fortunate\r\noutcome, but from the honey to expect disease (because invalids crave\r\nit) and from the milk famine; for they should encounter so great a\r\nscarcity of provisions as to seek for food of native growth and\r\npasturage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: In Greek, _Birdless_.]\r\n\r\nManius, then, interpreted the omens in this way, [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n33^22] AND AS HIS PROPHECY TURNED OUT TO BE CORRECT, HE GAINED\r\nTHEREAFTER A REPUTATION FOR SKILL AND FOREKNOWLEDGE IN ALL MATTERS.\r\nNow Volumnius was ordered to make war upon the Samnites; Fabius\r\nMaximus Rullus and Publius Decius were chosen consuls and were sent to\r\nwithstand the Gauls and the other warriors in the Gallic contingent.\r\nThey, having come with speed to Etruria, saw the camp of Appius, which\r\nwas fortified by a double palisade; and they pulled up the stakes and\r\ncarried them off, instructing the soldiers to place their hope of\r\nsafety in their weapons. So they joined battle with the enemy.\r\nMeanwhile a wolf in pursuit of a deer had invaded the space between\r\nthe two armies and darting toward the Romans passed through their\r\nranks. This encouraged them, for they regarded themselves as having a\r\nbond of union with him, since, according to tradition, a she-wolf had\r\nreared Romulus. But the deer ran to the other side and was struck\r\ndown, thus leaving to _them_ fear and the issue of disaster. When the\r\narmies collided, Maximus quite easily conquered the foes opposed to\r\nhim, but Decius was defeated. And recalling the self-devotion of his\r\nfather, undertaken on account of the dream, he likewise devoted\r\nhimself, though without giving anybody any information about his act.\r\nScarcely had he let himself be slain, when the men ranged at his side,\r\npartly through shame at his deed (feeling that he had perished\r\nvoluntarily for them) and partly in the hopes of certain victory as a\r\nresult of this occurrence, checked their flight and nobly withstood\r\ntheir pursuers. At this juncture Maximus, too, assailed the latter in\r\nthe rear and slaughtered vast numbers. The survivors took to their\r\nheels and were annihilated. Fabius Maximus then burned the corpse of\r\nDecius together with the spoils and made a truce with such as asked\r\nfor peace.\r\n\r\nThe following year Atilius Regulus again waged war with the Samnites.\r\nAnd for a time they carried on an evenly contested struggle, but\r\neventually, after the Samnites had won a victory, the Romans conquered\r\nthem in turn, took them captive, led them beneath the yoke, and so\r\nreleased them. [Sidenote: FRAG. 33^23] THE SAMNITES, ENRAGED AT WHAT\r\nHAD OCCURRED, RESORTED TO DESPERATE MEASURES WITH THE INTENTION OF\r\nEITHER CONQUERING OR BEING UTTERLY DESTROYED, THREATENING WITH DEATH\r\nHIM WHO SHOULD REMAIN AT HOME. So these invaded Campania: but the\r\nconsuls ravaged Samnium, since it was destitute of soldiers, and\r\ncaptured a few cities. Therefore the Samnites abandoning Campania made\r\nhaste to reach their own land; and having come into hostile collision\r\nwith one of the consuls they were defeated by a trick and in their\r\nflight met with terrible reverses, losing their camp and in addition\r\nthe fortress to the assistance of which they were advancing. The\r\nconsul celebrated a triumph and devoted to public uses the goods\r\ngathered from the spoils. The other consul made a campaign against the\r\nEtruscans and reduced them in short order: he then levied upon them\r\ncontributions of grain and money, of which he distributed a part to\r\nthe soldiers and deposited the rest in the treasuries.\r\n\r\nHowever, there befell a mighty pestilence, and the Samnites and\r\nFalisci began to bestir themselves; they entertained a contempt for\r\nthe Romans both on account of the disease and because, since no war\r\nmenaced, they had chosen the consuls not on grounds of excellence. The\r\nRomans, ascertaining the situation, sent out Carvilius along with\r\nJunius Brutus, and with Quintus Fabius his father Rullus Maximus, as\r\nsubcommanders or lieutenants. Brutus worsted the Falisci and\r\nplundered their possessions as well as those of the other Etruscans:\r\nFabius marched out of Rome before his father and pushed rapidly\r\nforward when he learned that the Samnites were plundering Campania.\r\nFalling in with some scouts of theirs and seeing them quickly retire\r\nhe got the impression that all the enemy were at that point and\r\nbelieved they were in flight. Accordingly, in his hurry to come to\r\nblows with them before his father should arrive, in order that the\r\nsuccess might appear to be his own and not his elder's, he went ahead\r\nwith a careless formation. Thus he encountered a compact body of foes\r\nand would have been utterly destroyed, had not night intervened. Many\r\nof his men died also after that with no physician or relative to\r\nattend them, because they had hastened on far ahead of the baggage\r\ncarriers in the expectation of immediate victory. Of a surety they\r\nwould have perished on the following day but for the fact that the\r\nSamnites, thinking Fabius's father to be near, felt afraid and\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 33^24] THOSE IN THE CITY ON HEARING THIS BECAME\r\nTERRIBLY ANGRY, SUMMONED THE CONSUL, AND WANTED TO PUT HIM ON TRIAL.\r\nBUT THE OLD MAN HIS FATHER BY ENUMERATING HIS OWN AND HIS ANCESTORS'\r\nBRAVE DEEDS, BY PROMISING THAT HIS SON SHOULD MAKE NO RECORD THAT WAS\r\nUNWORTHY OF THEM, AND BY URGING HIS SON'S YOUTH TO ACCOUNT FOR THE\r\nMISFORTUNE, IMMEDIATELY ABATED THEIR WRATH. JOINING HIM IN THE\r\nCAMPAIGN HE CONQUERED THE SAMNITES IN BATTLE, CAPTURED THEIR CAMP,\r\nRAVAGED THEIR COUNTRY, AND DROVE AWAY GREAT BOOTY. A PART OF IT HE\r\nDEVOTED TO PUBLIC USES AND A PART HE ACCORDED TO THE SOLDIERS. FOR\r\nTHESE REASONS THE ROMANS EXTOLLED HIM AND ORDERED THAT HIS SON ALSO\r\nSHOULD COMMAND FOR THE FUTURE WITH CONSULAR POWERS AND STILL EMPLOY\r\nHIS FATHER AS LIEUTENANT. THE LATTER MANAGED AND ARRANGED EVERYTHING\r\nFOR HIM, SPARING HIS OLD AGE NOT A WHIT, YET HE DID NOT LET IT BE SEEN\r\nTHAT HE WAS EXECUTING THE BUSINESS ON HIS OWN RESPONSIBILITY, BUT MADE\r\nTHE GLORY OF HIS EXPLOITS ATTACH TO HIS CHILD.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 37] VIII, 2.--AFTER THIS, WHEN THE TRIBUNES MOVED AN\r\nANNULMENT OF DEBTS, THE PEOPLE, SINCE THIS WAS NOT YIELDED BY THE\r\nLENDERS AS WELL, FELL INTO TURMOIL: and their turbulent behavior was\r\nnot quieted until foes came against the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 9, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\nThose to begin the wars were the Tarentini, [Sidenote: FRAG. 39^1] WHO\r\nHAD ASSOCIATED WITH THEMSELVES THE ETRUSCANS AND GAULS AND SAMNITES\r\nAND SEVERAL OTHER TRIBES. These allies the Romans engaged and defeated\r\nin various battles, with different consuls on different occasions, but\r\nthe Tarentini, although they had themselves been the authors of the\r\nwar, nevertheless did not yet openly present an imposing array in\r\nbattle. [Sidenote: FRAG. 39^3] NOW LUCIUS VALERIUS WHILE ADMIRAL\r\nWANTED TO ANCHOR WITH HIS TRIREMES OFF TARENTUM (BEING ON HIS WAY TO A\r\nPLACE WHITHER HE HAD BEEN DESPATCHED WITH THEM), FOR HE DEEMED THE\r\nCOUNTRY FRIENDLY. [Sidenote: FRAG. 39^4] BUT THE TARENTINI, OWING TO\r\nA GUILTY SENSE OF THEIR OWN OPERATIONS, SUSPECTED THAT VALERIUS WAS\r\nSAILING AGAINST THEM, AND IN A PASSION SET SAIL LIKEWISE AND ATTACKING\r\nHIM WHEN HE WAS EXPECTING NO HOSTILE ACT SENT HIM TO THE BOTTOM ALONG\r\nWITH MANY OTHERS. OF THE CAPTIVES THEY IMPRISONED SOME AND PUT OTHERS\r\nTO DEATH. WHEN THE ROMANS HEARD OF THIS, THEY WERE INDIGNANT, TO BE\r\nSURE, BUT NEVERTHELESS DESPATCHED ENVOYS UPBRAIDING THEM AND DEMANDING\r\nSATISFACTION. THE OFFENDERS NOT ONLY FAILED TO VOUCHSAFE THEM ANY\r\nDECENT ANSWER, BUT ACTUALLY JEERED AT THEM, GOING SO FAR AS TO SOIL\r\nTHE CLOTHING OF LUCIUS POSTUMIUS, THE HEAD OF THE EMBASSY. AT THIS AN\r\nUPROAR AROSE AND THE TARENTINI INDULGED IN CONTINUED GUFFAWS. BUT\r\nPOSTUMIUS CRIED: \"LAUGH ON, LAUGH ON WHILE YOU MAY! FOR LONG WILL BE\r\nTHE PERIOD OF YOUR WEEPING, WHEN YOU SHALL WASH THIS GARMENT CLEAN\r\nWITH YOUR BLOOD.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the return of the envoys the Romans, learning what had been done,\r\nwere grieved and voted that Lucius AEmilius the consul make a campaign\r\nagainst the Tarentini. He advanced close to Tarentum and sent them\r\nfavorable propositions, thinking that they would choose peace on fair\r\nterms. Now they were at variance among themselves in their opinions.\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 39^6?] The elderly and well-to-do were anxious for\r\npeace, but those who were youthful and who had little or nothing were\r\nfor war. The younger generation had its way. Being timid for all that\r\nthey planned to invite Pyrrhus of Epirus to form an alliance, and sent\r\nto him envoys and gifts. AEmilius, learning this, proceeded to pillage\r\nand devastate their country. They made sorties but were routed, so\r\nthat the Romans ravaged their country with impunity and got possession\r\nof some strongholds. AEmilius showed much consideration for those taken\r\nprisoners and liberated some of the more influential, and the\r\nTarentini, accordingly, filled with admiration for his kindness, were\r\nled to hope for reconciliation and so chose as leader with full powers\r\nAgis, who was of kindred to the Romans. Scarcely had he been elected\r\nwhen Cineas, sent ahead by Pyrrhus, planted himself in the pathway of\r\nnegotiations. [Sidenote: FRAG. 40^1] FOR PYRRHUS, KING OF THE\r\nSO-CALLED EPIRUS, SURPASSED EVERYBODY THROUGH NATURAL CLEVERNESS AND\r\nTHROUGH THE INFLUENCE AND EXPERIENCE BESTOWED BY EDUCATION; AND HE HAD\r\nMADE THE LARGER PART OF HELLAS HIS OWN, PARTLY BY BENEFITS AND PARTLY\r\nBY FEAR. [Sidenote: FRAG. 40^2] ACCORDINGLY, CHANCE HAVING THROWN THE\r\nENVOYS OF THE TARENTINI IN HIS WAY, HE DEEMED THE ALLIANCE A PIECE OF\r\nGOOD LUCK. FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME HE HAD HAD HIS EYE ON SICILY AND\r\nCARTHAGE AND SARDINIA, BUT NEVERTHELESS HE SHRANK FROM PERSONALLY\r\nTAKING THE INITIATIVE IN HOSTILITIES AGAINST THE ROMANS. He announced\r\nthat he would lead the Tarentini, but in order that the motive of his\r\ndeclaration might not be suspected (for reasons indicated) he stated\r\nthat he should return home without delay, and insisted upon a clause\r\nbeing added to the agreement to the effect that he should not be\r\ndetained by them in Italy further than actual need required. After\r\nsettling this agreement he detained the majority of the envoys as\r\nhostages, giving out that he wanted them to help him get the armies\r\nready: a few of them together with Cineas he sent in advance with\r\ntroops. As soon as they arrived the Tarentini took courage, gave up\r\ntheir attempted reconciliation with the Romans, and deposing Agris\r\nfrom his leadership elected one of the envoys leader. Shortly\r\nafterward Milo, sent by Pyrrhus with a force, took charge of their\r\nacropolis and personally superintended the manning of their wall. The\r\nTarentini were glad at this, feeling that they did not have to do\r\nguard duty or undergo any other troublesome labor, and they sent\r\nregular supplies of food to the men and consignments of money to\r\nPyrrhus.\r\n\r\nAEmilius for a time held his ground, but when he perceived that the\r\nPyrrhic soldiers had come, and recognized his inability on account of\r\nthe winter to maintain an opposition, he set out for Apulia. The\r\nTarentini laid an ambush at a narrow passage through which he was\r\nobliged to go, and by their arrows, javelins and slingshots rendered\r\nprogress impossible for him. But he put at the head of his line their\r\ncaptives whom he was conveying. Fear fell upon the Tarentini that they\r\nmight destroy their own men instead of the Romans, and they ceased\r\ntheir efforts.\r\n\r\nNow Pyrrhus set off, [Sidenote: FRAG. 40^4] NOT EVEN AWAITING THE\r\nCOMING OF SPRING, taking a large, picked army, and twenty elephants,\r\nbeasts never previously beheld by the Italians. Hence the latter were\r\ninvariably filled with alarm and astonishment. While crossing the\r\nIonian Sea he encountered a storm and lost many soldiers of his army:\r\nthe remainder were scattered by the violent waters. Only with\r\ndifficulty, then, and by land travel did he reach Tarentum. He at once\r\nimpressed those in their prime into service alongside of his own\r\nsoldiers so as to make sure that they should not be led, by having a\r\nseparate company, to think of rebellion; he closed the theatre,\r\npresumably on account of the war and to prevent the people from\r\ngathering there and setting on foot any uprising; also he forbade them\r\nto assemble for banquets and revels, and ordered the youth to practice\r\nin arms instead of spending all day in the market-place. When some,\r\nindignant at this, left the ranks, he stationed guards from his own\r\ncontingent so that no one could leave the city. The inhabitants,\r\noppressed by these measures, and by supplying food, compelled as they\r\nwere, too, to receive the guardsmen into their houses, repented, since\r\nthey found in Pyrrhus only a master, not an ally. He, fearing for\r\nthese reasons that they might lean to the Roman cause, took note of\r\nall the men who had any ability as politicians or could dominate the\r\npopulace and sent them one after another to Epirus to his son on\r\nvarious excuses; occasionally, however, he would quietly assassinate\r\nthem instead. A certain Aristarchus, who was accounted one of the\r\nnoblest of the Tarentini and was a most persuasive speaker, he made\r\nhis boon companion to the end that this man should be suspected by the\r\npeople of having the interests of Pyrrhus at heart. When, however, he\r\nsaw that he still had the confidence of the throng, he gave him an\r\nerrand to Epirus. Aristarchus, not daring to dispute his behest, set\r\nsail, but went to Rome.\r\n\r\nVIII, 3.--Such was the behavior of Pyrrhus toward the Tarentini.\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 40^8] THOSE IN ROME LEARNING THAT PYRRHUS HAD COME TO\r\nTARENTUM WERE SMITTEN WITH TERROR BECAUSE THE ITALIAN STATES HAD BEEN\r\nSET AT ENMITY WITH THEM AND BECAUSE HE WAS REPORTED TO BE WITHOUT\r\nDOUBT A GOOD WARRIOR AND TO HAVE A FORCE THAT WAS BY NO MEANS\r\nDESPICABLE AS AN ADVERSARY. So they proceeded to enlist soldiers and\r\nto gather money and to distribute garrisons among the allied cities to\r\nprevent them from likewise revolting; and learning that some were\r\nalready stirred with sedition they punished the principal men in them.\r\nA handful of those from Praeneste were brought to Rome late in the\r\nafternoon and thrown into the treasury for security. Thereby a certain\r\noracle was fulfilled for the Romans. For an oracle had told them once\r\nthat these people should occupy the Roman treasure-house. The oracle,\r\nthen, resulted this way: the men lost their lives.\r\n\r\nValerius Lavinius was despatched against Pyrrhus, the Tarentini, and\r\nthe rest of their associates, but a part of the army was retained in\r\nthe city. As for Lavinius, he at once set out on his march so that he\r\nmight carry on the war as far as possible from his own territory. He\r\nhoped to frighten Pyrrhus by showing the latter those men advancing\r\nagainst him of their own accord whom he had thought to besiege. In the\r\ncourse of his journey he seized a strong strategic point in the land\r\nof the Lucanians, and he left behind a force in Lucania to hinder the\r\npeople from giving aid to his opponents.\r\n\r\nPyrrhus on learning of Lavinius's approach made a start before the\r\nlatter came in sight, established a camp, and was desirous of using up\r\ntime while waiting for allies to join. He sent a haughty letter to\r\nLavinius with the design of overawing him. The writing was couched\r\nthus: \"King Pyrrhus to Lavinius, Greeting. I learn that you are\r\nleading an army against Tarentum. Send it away, therefore, and come\r\nyourself to me with few attendants. For I will judge between you, if\r\nyou have any blame to impute to each other, and I will compel the\r\nparty at fault, however unwilling, to grant justice.\" Lavinius wrote\r\nthe following reply to Pyrrhus: \"You seem to me, Pyrrhus, to have been\r\nquite daft when you set yourself up as judge between the Tarentini and\r\nus before rendering to us an account of your crossing over into Italy\r\nat all. I will come, therefore, with all my army and will exact the\r\nappropriate recompense both from the Tarentini and from you. What use\r\ncan I have for nonsense and palaver, when I can stand trial in the\r\ncourt of Mars, our progenitor?\" After sending such an answering\r\ndespatch he hurried on and pitched camp, leaving the stream of the\r\nriver at that point between them. Having apprehended some scouts he\r\nshowed them his troops and after telling them he had more of them,\r\nmany times that number, he sent them back. Pyrrhus, struck with alarm\r\nby this, was not desirous of fighting because some of the allies had\r\nnot yet joined his force, and he was constantly hoping that provisions\r\nwould fail the Romans while they delayed on hostile soil. Lavinius,\r\ntoo, reckoned on this and was eager to join issue. As the soldiers had\r\nbecome terrified at the reputation of Pyrrhus and on account of the\r\nelephants, he called them together and delivered a speech containing\r\nmany exhortations to courage; then he busily prepared to close with\r\nPyrrhus, willing or unwilling. The latter had no heart to fight, but\r\nin order to avoid an appearance of fearing the Romans he also in\r\nperson addressed his own men, inciting them to the conflict. Lavinius\r\ntried to cross the river opposite the camp, but was prevented. So he\r\nretired and himself remained in position with his infantry, but sent\r\nthe cavalry off (apparently on some marauding expedition) with\r\ninjunctions to march some distance and then make the attempt. In this\r\nway both they assailed the enemy unexpectedly in the rear, and\r\nLavinius, in the midst of the foe's confusion, crossed the river and\r\ntook part in the battle. Pyrrhus came to the aid of his own men, who\r\nwere in flight, but lost his horse by a wound and was thought by them\r\nto have been killed. Then, the one side being dejected and the other\r\nscornfully elated, their actions were correspondingly altered. He\r\nbecame aware of this and gave his clothing, which was more striking\r\nthan that of the rest, to Megacles, bidding him put it on and ride\r\nabout in all directions to the end that thinking him safe his\r\nopponents might be brought to fear and his followers to feel\r\nencouragement. As for himself, he put on an ordinary uniform and\r\nencountered the Romans with his full army, save the elephants, and by\r\nbringing assistance to the contestants wherever they were in trouble\r\nhe did his supporters a great deal of good. At first, then, for a\r\nlarge part of the day they fought evenly; but when a man killed\r\nMegacles, thinking to have killed Pyrrhus and creating this impression\r\nin the minds of the rest, the Romans gained vigor and their opponents\r\nbegan to give way. [Sidenote: FRAG. 40^12] PYRRHUS, NOTING WHAT WAS\r\nTAKING PLACE, CAST OFF HIS CAP AND WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD BARE; AND\r\nTHE BATTLE TOOK AN OPPOSITE TURN. Seeing this, Lavinius, who had\r\nhorsemen in hiding somewhere, outside the battle, ordered them to\r\nattack the enemy in the rear. In response to this Pyrrhus, as a device\r\nto meet it, raised the signal for the elephants. Then, indeed, at the\r\nsight of the animals, which was out of all common experience, at their\r\nbloodcurdling trumpeting, and at the clatter of arms which their\r\nriders, seated in the towers, made, both the Romans themselves became\r\npanic stricken and their horses, in a frenzy, either shook off their\r\nriders or bolted, carrying them away. Disheartened at this the Roman\r\narmy was turned to flight and in their rout some soldiers were\r\ndestroyed by the men in the towers on the elephants' backs, and others\r\nby the beasts themselves, which with their trunks and horns (or\r\nteeth?) took the lives of many and crushed and trampled under foot no\r\nless. The cavalry, following after, slew many; not one, indeed, would\r\nhave been left, had not an elephant been wounded, and by its own\r\nstruggles as a result of the wound as well as by its trumpeting thrown\r\nthe rest into confusion. Only this restrained Pyrrhus from pursuit and\r\nonly in this way did the Romans manage to cross the river and make\r\ntheir escape into an Apulian city. Many of Pyrrhus's soldiers and\r\nofficers alike fell, so that [Sidenote: FRAG. 40^13] WHEN CERTAIN MEN\r\nCONGRATULATED HIM ON HIS VICTORY, HE SAID; \"IF WE EVER CONQUER AGAIN\r\nIN LIKE FASHION, WE SHALL BE RUINED.\" THE ROMANS, HOWEVER, HE ADMIRED\r\nEVEN IN THEIR DEFEAT, DECLARING: \"I SHOULD ALREADY HAVE MASTERED THE\r\nWHOLE INHABITED WORLD, WERE I KING OF THE ROMANS.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 40^14] PYRRHUS, ACCORDINGLY, ACQUIRED A GREAT\r\nREPUTATION FOR HIS VICTORY AND MANY CAME OVER TO HIS SIDE: THE ALLIES\r\nALSO ESPOUSED HIS CAUSE. THESE HE REBUKED SOMEWHAT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR\r\nTARDINESS, BUT GAVE THEM A SHARE OF THE SPOIL. VIII, 4.--The men of\r\nRome felt grief at the defeat, but they sent an army to Lavinius; and\r\nthey summoned Tiberius from Etruria and put the city under guard when\r\nthey learned that Pyrrhus was hastening against it. Lavinius, however,\r\nas soon as he had cured his own followers of their wounds and had\r\ncollected the scattered, the reinforcements from Rome now having\r\narrived, followed on the track of Pyrrhus and harassed him. Finding\r\nout that the king was ambitious to capture Capua he occupied it in\r\nadvance and guarded it. Disappointed there Pyrrhus set out for\r\nNeapolis. Since he developed no power to accomplish anything at this\r\nplace either and was in haste to occupy Rome, he passed on through\r\nEtruria with the object of winning that people also to his cause. He\r\nlearned that they had made a treaty with the Romans and that Tiberius\r\nwas moving to meet him face to face. (Lavinius was dogging his\r\nfootsteps.) [Sidenote: FRAG. 40^19] A DREAD SEIZED HIM OF BEING CUT\r\nOFF ON ALL SIDES BY THEM WHILE HE WAS IN UNFAMILIAR REGIONS and he\r\nwould advance no farther. [Sidenote: FRAG. 40^20] WHEN, AS HE WAS\r\nRETREATING AND HAD REACHED THE VICINITY OF CAMPANIA, LAVINIUS\r\nCONFRONTED HIM AND THE LATTER'S ARMY WAS MUCH LARGER THAN IT WAS\r\nBEFORE, HE DECLARED THAT THE ROMAN TROOPS WHEN CUT TO PIECES GREW\r\nWHOLE AGAIN, HYDRA-FASHION. AND HE MADE PREPARATIONS IN HIS TURN, BUT\r\nDID NOT COME TO THE ISSUE OF BATTLE. He had ordered his own soldiers\r\nbefore the shock of conflict, in order to terrify the Romans, to smite\r\ntheir shields with their spears and cry aloud while the trumpeters and\r\nthe elephants raised a united blare. But when the other side raised a\r\nmuch greater shout, actually scaring the followers of Pyrrhus, he\r\nno longer wanted to come to close quarters, but retired, as if he\r\nfound the omens bad. And he came to Tarentum. [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n40^21] THITHER CAME ROMAN ENVOYS TO TREAT IN BEHALF OF THE\r\nCAPTIVES,--FABRICIUS AMONG OTHERS. THESE HE ENTERTAINED LAVISHLY AND\r\nSHOWED THEM HONOR, EXPECTING THAT THEY WOULD CONCLUDE A TRUCE AND MAKE\r\nTERMS AS THE DEFEATED PARTY. [Sidenote: FRAG. 40^22] FABRICIUS ASKED\r\nTHAT HE MIGHT GET BACK THE MEN CAPTURED IN BATTLE FOR SUCH RANSOM AS\r\nSHOULD BE PLEASING TO BOTH. PYRRHUS, QUITE DUMFOUNDED BECAUSE THE MAN\r\nDID NOT SAY THAT HE WAS ALSO COMMISSIONED TO TREAT ABOUT PEACE, TOOK\r\nCOUNSEL PRIVATELY WITH HIS FRIENDS, AS WAS HIS WONT, ABOUT THE RETURN\r\nOF THE CAPTIVES, BUT ALSO ABOUT THE WAR AND HOW HE SHOULD CONDUCT IT.\r\nMilo advised neither returning the captives nor making a truce, but\r\novercoming all remaining resistance by war, since the Romans were\r\nalready defeated: Cineas, however, gave advice just the opposite of\r\nhis; he approved of surrendering the captives without price and\r\nsending envoys and money to Rome for the purpose of obtaining an\r\narmistice and peace. [Sidenote: FRAG. 40^23] TO HIS DECISION DID THE\r\nREST ALSO CLEAVE, AND PYRRHUS, TOO, CHANCED TO BE OF THIS MIND. HAVING\r\nCALLED THE AMBASSADORS, THEREFORE, HE SAID: \"NOT WILLINGLY, ROMANS,\r\nDID I LATELY MAKE WAR UPON YOU, AND I HAVE NO WISH TO WAR AGAINST YOU\r\nNOW. IT WAS MY DESIRE TO BECOME YOUR FRIEND. WHEREFORE I RELEASE TO\r\nYOU THE CAPTIVES WITHOUT RANSOM AND ASK THE PRIVILEGE OF MAKING\r\nPEACE.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 40^24] THESE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN TO THE ENVOYS AS A\r\nWHOLE AND HAD EITHER GIVEN OR FURNISHED THEM PROMISES OF MONEY, BUT IN\r\nCONVERSATION WITH FABRICIUS ALONE HE SAID: \"I WOULD GLADLY BECOME A\r\nFRIEND TO ALL ROMANS, BUT MOST OF ALL TO YOU. I SEE THAT YOU ARE AN\r\nEXCELLENT MAN AND I ASK YOU TO HELP ME IN GETTING PEACE.\" WITH THESE\r\nWORDS HE ATTEMPTED TO BESTOW UPON HIM A NUMBER OF GIFTS. BUT FABRICIUS\r\nSAID: \"I COMMEND YOU FOR DESIRING PEACE, AND I WILL EFFECT IT FOR YOU,\r\nIF IT SHALL PROVE TO OUR ADVANTAGE. FOR YOU WILL NOT ASK ME, A MAN\r\nWHO, AS YOU SAY, PRETENDS TO UPRIGHTNESS, TO DO ANYTHING AGAINST MY\r\nCOUNTRY. NAY, I WOULD NOT EVEN ACCEPT ANY OF THESE THINGS WHICH YOU\r\nARE FAIN TO GIVE. I ASK YOU, THEREFORE, WHETHER YOU IN VERY TRUTH\r\nREGARD ME AS A REPUTABLE MAN OR NOT. IF I AM A SCOUNDREL, HOW IS IT\r\nTHAT YOU DEEM ME WORTHY OF GIFTS? IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, I AM A MAN OF\r\nHONOR, HOW CAN YOU BID ME ACCEPT THEM? BE THEN ASSURED THAT I HAVE\r\nVERY MANY POSSESSIONS, THAT I AM SATISFIED WITH WHAT I NOW HAVE AND\r\nFEEL NO NEED OF MORE. YOU, HOWEVER, EVEN IF YOU ARE EVER SO RICH, ARE\r\nIN UNSPEAKABLE POVERTY. FOR YOU WOULD NOT HAVE CROSSED OVER TO THIS\r\nLAND, LEAVING BEHIND EPIRUS AND THE REST OF YOUR POSSESSIONS, IF YOU\r\nHAD BEEN CONTENT WITH THEM AND WERE NOT REACHING OUT FOR MORE.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this conversation had taken place as recounted, the envoys took\r\nthe captives and departed. Pyrrhus despatched Cineas to Rome with a\r\nlarge amount of gold coin and women's apparel of every description, so\r\nthat even if some of the men should resist, their wives, at least, won\r\nby the appeal of the finery, might make them share in the prostitution\r\nof principles. Cineas on coming to the city did not seek an audience\r\nwith the senate, but lingered about, alleging now one reason, now\r\nanother. He was visiting the houses of leading men and by his\r\nconversation and gifts was slowly extending his influence over them.\r\nWhen he had won the attachment of a number, he entered the\r\nsenate-chamber and spoke, saying; \"King Pyrrhus offers as his defence\r\nthe fact that he came not to make war upon you, but to reconcile the\r\nTarentini, and in answer to their entreaties. Indeed, he has released\r\nyour prisoners, waiving ransom, and though he might have ravaged your\r\ncountry and assaulted your city, he requests to be enrolled among\r\nyour friends and allies, hoping to gain much assistance from you and\r\nto render you still more and greater benefits in return.\"\r\n\r\nThereupon the greater part of the senators evinced pleasure because of\r\nthe gifts and because of the captives: however, they made no reply,\r\nbut went on deliberating for several days more as to the proper course\r\nto pursue. There was a deal of talk, but the disposition to accord a\r\ntruce predominated. On learning this Appius the Blind was carried to\r\nthe senate-house (for by reason of his age and his infirmity he was a\r\nstay-at-home) and declared that the _modus vivendi_ with Pyrrhus was\r\nnot advantageous to the State. He urged them to dismiss Cineas at once\r\nfrom the city and to make known to Pyrrhus by his mouth that the king\r\nmust first withdraw to his home country and from there make\r\npropositions to them about peace or about anything else he wanted.\r\nThis was the advice Appius gave. The senate delayed no longer, but\r\nforthwith unanimously voted to send Cineas that very day across the\r\nborders and to wage an implacable war with Pyrrhus, so long as he\r\nshould abide in Italy. They imposed upon the captives certain\r\ndegradations in the campaigns and used them no longer against Pyrrhus\r\nnor for any other project as a unit (out of apprehension that if they\r\nwere together they might rebel), but sent them to do garrison duty, a\r\nfew here, a few there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 10, BOISSEVAIN)._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 279 (_a.u._ 475)] VIII, 5.--During the winter both\r\nsides busied themselves with preparations. When spring had now begun,\r\nPyrrhus invaded Apulia and reduced many places by force, many also by\r\ncapitulation. Finally the Romans came upon him near a city called\r\nAsculum and pitched camp opposite. For several days they lingered,\r\nrather avoiding each other. The Romans were not feeling confident\r\nagainst men who had once beaten them, and the others dreaded the\r\nRomans as persons animated by desperation. Meanwhile some were talking\r\nto the effect that Decius was getting ready to \"devote himself\" after\r\nthe fashion of his father and grandfather, and by so doing they\r\nterribly alarmed the followers of Pyrrhus, who believed that through\r\nhis death they would certainly be ruined. Pyrrhus then convened his\r\nsoldiers and discussed this matter, advising them not to be\r\ndisheartened nor scared out of their wits by such talk. One human\r\nbeing, he said, could not by dying prevail over many nor could any\r\nincantation or magic prove superior to arms and men. By making these\r\nremarks and confirming his words by arguments Pyrrhus encouraged the\r\narmy under his lead. Also he enquired into the details of the costume\r\nwhich the Decii had used in devoting themselves, and sent injunctions\r\nto his men, if they should see anybody so arrayed, not to kill him,\r\nbut seize him alive. [Sidenote: FRAG. 40^28] AND HE SENT TO DECIUS\r\nAND TOLD HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT SUCCEED IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS, EVEN IF\r\nHE WISHED IT, AND THREATENED THAT IF HE WERE TAKEN ALIVE, HE SHOULD\r\nPERISH MISERABLY. TO THIS THE CONSULS ANSWERED THAT THEY WERE IN NO\r\nNEED OF HAVING RECOURSE TO SUCH A PROCEEDING AS THE ONE MENTIONED,\r\nSINCE THEY WERE SURE TO CONQUER HIM ANYWAY. There was a river not easy\r\nto ford running between the two camps, and they enquired whether he\r\nchose to cross unmolested himself, while they retired, or whether he\r\nwould allow them to do it, the object being that the forces should\r\nencounter each other intact and so from a battle with conditions equal\r\nthe test of valor might be made an accurate one. The Romans delivered\r\nthis speech to overawe him, but Pyrrhus granted them permission to\r\ncross the river, since he placed great reliance upon his elephants.\r\nThe Romans among their other preparations made ready, as a measure\r\nagainst the elephants, projecting beams on wagons, overlaid with iron\r\nand bristling in all directions. From these they intended to shoot and\r\nto withstand the animals with fire as well as by other means. When the\r\nconflict began, the Romans forced the Greeks back, slowly to be sure,\r\nbut none the less effectually, until Pyrrhus, bringing his elephants\r\nto bear not opposite their chariots but at the other end of the line,\r\nrouted their cavalry through fear of the beasts even before they had\r\ncome close. Upon their infantry, however, he inflicted no great\r\ndamage. Meantime some of the Apulians had started for the camp of the\r\nEpirots and by so doing brought about victory for the Romans. For when\r\nPyrrhus sent some of his warriors against them, all the rest were\r\nthrown into disorder and suspecting that their tents had been\r\ncaptured and their companions were in flight they gave way. Numbers of\r\nthem fell, Pyrrhus and many commanding officers besides were wounded,\r\nand later on account of the lack of food and of medical supplies they\r\nincurred great loss. Hence he retreated to Tarentum before the Romans\r\nwere aware. As for the consuls, they crossed the river to fight, but\r\nwhen they ascertained that all had scattered, they withdrew to their\r\nown cities. They were unable to pursue after their foes on account of\r\nwounds among their own following. Then the Romans went into winter\r\nquarters in Apulia, whereas Pyrrhus sent for soldiers and money from\r\nhome and went on with other preparations. But learning that Fabricius\r\nand Pappus had been chosen consuls and had arrived in camp, he was not\r\nconstant in the same intention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 278 (_a.u._ 476)] The aforesaid consuls were now in\r\nthe midst of their army, when a certain Nicias, one of those believed\r\nto be loyal to Pyrrhus, came to Fabricius and offered to murder him\r\ntreacherously. Fabricius, indignant at this (for he wanted to overcome\r\nthe enemy by valor and main force, like Camillus), informed Pyrrhus of\r\nthe plot. This action of his moved the king so strongly that he again\r\nreleased the Roman captives without price and sent envoys once more in\r\nregard to peace. But when the Romans made no reply about peace, but as\r\nbefore bade him depart from Italy and only in that event make\r\npropositions to them, and since they kept overrunning and capturing\r\nthe cities in alliance with him, [Sidenote: FRAG. 40^29] HE FELL INTO\r\nPERPLEXITY; till at length some Syracusans called on him for\r\naid--they had been quarreling, as it chanced, ever since the death of\r\nAgathocles--and surrendered to him both themselves and their city.\r\nHereupon he again breathed freely, hoping to subjugate all of Sicily.\r\nLeaving Milo behind in Italy to keep guard over Tarentum and the other\r\npositions, he himself sailed away after letting it be understood that\r\nhe would soon return. The Syracusans welcomed him and laid everything\r\nat his feet, so that in brief time he had again become great and the\r\nCarthaginians in fright secured additional mercenaries from Italy. But\r\npresently his prospects fell to the other extreme of fortune\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 40^30] BY REASON OF THE FACT THAT HE EITHER EXPELLED\r\nOR SLEW MANY WHO HELD OFFICE AND HAD INCURRED HIS SUSPICIONS. Then the\r\nCarthaginians, seeing that he was not strong in private forces and did\r\nnot possess the devotion of the natives, took up the war vigorously.\r\nThey harbored any Syracusans who were exiled and rendered his position\r\nso uncomfortable that he abandoned not only Syracuse, but Sicily as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 277 (_a.u._ 477)] VIII, 6.--The Romans on finding out\r\nhis absence took courage and turned their attention to requiting those\r\nwho had invited him. Postponing till another occasion the case of the\r\nTarentini they invaded Samnium with their consuls Rufinus and Junius,\r\ndevastated the country as they went along, and took several deserted\r\nforts. The Samnites had conveyed their dearest and most valuable\r\ntreasures into the hills called the _Cranita_, because they bear a\r\nlarge growth of cornel-wood (_crania_). The Romans in contempt for\r\nthem dared to begin the ascent of the aforementioned hills. As the\r\nregion was tangled with shrubbery and difficult of access many were\r\nkilled and many, too, were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\nThe consuls now no longer carried on the war together, since each\r\nblamed the other for the disaster, but Junius went on ravaging a\r\nportion of Samnium, while Rufinus inflicted injury upon Lucanians and\r\nBruttians. He then started against Croton, which had revolted from\r\nRome. His friends had sent for him, but the other party got ahead of\r\nthem by bringing a garrison from Milo, of which Nicomachus was\r\ncommander. Ignorant of this fact he approached the walls carelessly,\r\nsupposing that his friends controlled affairs, and suffered a setback\r\nby a sudden sortie made against him. Then, bethinking himself of a\r\ntrick, he captured the city. He sent two captives as pretended\r\ndeserters into Croton; one at once, declaring that he had despaired of\r\ncapturing the place and was about to set out into Locris, which was\r\nbeing betrayed to him; the other later, corroborating the report with\r\nthe further detail that he was on his way. That the story might gain\r\ncredence he packed up the baggage and affected to be in haste.\r\nNicomachus trusted this news (for his scouts made the same report),\r\nand leaving Croton set off with speed into Locrian territory by a\r\nsomewhat shorter road. When he had got well into Locris, Rufinus\r\nturned back to Croton, and escaping observation because he was not\r\nexpected and because of a mist that then prevailed he captured the\r\ncity. Nicomachus learning this went back to Tarentum, and\r\nencountering Rufinus on the way lost many men. The Locrians came over\r\nto the Roman side.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 276 (_a.u._ 478)] The next year the Romans made\r\nexpeditions into Samnium and into Lucania and fought with the\r\nBruttians. Pyrrhus, who had been driven out of Sicily and had\r\nreturned, was now troubling them grievously. He got back the Locrians\r\n(by their killing the Roman garrison and changing their rulers), but\r\nin a campaign against Rhegium was repulsed, was himself wounded, and\r\nlost great numbers. He then retired into Locris and after executing a\r\nfew who opposed his cause he got food and money from the rest and made\r\nhis way back to Tarentum. The Samnites, hard pressed by the Romans,\r\ncaused him to leave the shelter of that town: [Sidenote: B.C. 275\r\n(_a.u._ 479)] but on coming to their assistance he was put to flight.\r\nA young elephant was wounded, and shaking off its riders wandered\r\nabout in search of its mother; the latter thereupon became\r\nunmanageable, and as all the rest of the elephants raised a din\r\neverything was thrown into dire confusion. Finally the Romans won the\r\nday, killing many men and capturing eight elephants, and occupied the\r\nenemy's entrenchments. Pyrrhus accompanied by a few horsemen made his\r\nescape to Tarentum, and from there sailed back to Epirus, leaving Milo\r\nbehind with a garrison to take care of Tarentum because he expected to\r\ncome back again. He also gave them a chair fastened with straps made\r\nfrom the skin of Nicias, whom he put to death for treachery. This was\r\nthe vengeance, then, that he took upon Nicias, [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n40^32] AND HE WAS INTENDING TO EXACT VENGEANCE FROM SOME YOUTHS WHO\r\nHAD RIDICULED HIM AT A BANQUET; BUT HE ASKED THEM WHY THEY WERE\r\nRIDICULING HIM, AND WHEN THEY ANSWERED: \"WE SHOULD HAVE SAID A LOT\r\nMORE THINGS A GOOD DEAL WORSE, IF THE WINE HADN'T FAILED US\", HE\r\nLAUGHED AND LET THEM GO.\r\n\r\nNow Pyrrhus, who had made a most distinguished record among generals,\r\nwho had inspired the Romans with great fear and left Italy in the\r\nfifth year to make a campaign against Greece, not long afterward met\r\nhis death in Argos. A woman, as the story runs, being eager to catch a\r\nsight of him from the roof as he passed by, made a misstep and falling\r\nupon him killed him. The same year Fabricius and Pappus became\r\ncensors; and among others whose names they erased from the lists of\r\nthe knights and the senators was Rufinus, though he had served as\r\ndictator and had twice been consul. The reason was that he had in his\r\npossession silver plate of ten pounds' weight. This shows how the\r\nRomans regarded poverty as consisting not in the failure to possess\r\nmany things but in wanting many things. Accordingly, their officials\r\nwho went abroad and others who set out on any business of importance\r\nto the State received besides other necessary allowances a seal-ring\r\nas a public gift.\r\n\r\nSome of the Tarentini who had been abused by Milo attacked him, with\r\nNico at their head. Not accomplishing anything they occupied a section\r\nof their own wall, and with that as headquarters kept making assaults\r\nupon Milo. When they found out that the Romans were disposed to make\r\nwar upon them, they despatched envoys to Rome and obtained peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 41] [Sidenote: B.C. 273 (_a.u._ 481)] AND PTOLEMY\r\nPHILADELPHUS, KING OF EGYPT, WHEN HE LEARNED THAT PYRRHUS HAD FARED\r\nPOORLY AND THAT THE ROMANS WERE GROWING, SENT GIFTS TO THEM AND MADE A\r\nCOMPACT. AND THE ROMANS, PLEASED WITH THIS, DESPATCHED AMBASSADORS TO\r\nHIM IN TURN. THE LATTER RECEIVED MAGNIFICENT GIFTS FROM HIM, WHICH\r\nTHEY WANTED TO PUT INTO THE TREASURY; THE SENATE, HOWEVER, WOULD NOT\r\nACCEPT THEM, BUT ALLOWED THEM TO KEEP THEM.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 272 (_a.u._ 482)] After this, by the activity of\r\nCarvilius they subdued the Samnites, and overcame the Lucanians and\r\nBruttians by the hands of Papirius. The same Papirius quelled the\r\nTarentini. The latter, angry at Milo and subjected to abuse by their\r\nown men, who, as has been told, made the attack on Milo, called in the\r\nCarthaginians to their aid when they learned that Pyrrhus was dead.\r\nMilo, seeing that his chances had been contracted to narrow limits, as\r\nthe Romans beset him on the land side and the Carthaginians on the\r\nwater front, surrendered the citadel to Papirius on condition of being\r\npermitted to depart unharmed with his immediate followers and his\r\nmoney. Then the Carthaginians, as representatives of a nation friendly\r\nto the Romans, sailed away, and the city made terms with Papirius.\r\nThey delivered to him their arms and their ships, demolished their\r\nwalls, and agreed to pay tribute.\r\n\r\nThe Romans, having thus secured control of the Tarentini, turned their\r\nattention to Rhegium, whose inhabitants after taking Croton by\r\ntreachery had razed the city to the ground and had slain the Romans\r\nthere. They averted the danger that was threatening them from the\r\nMamertines holding Messana (whom the people of Rhegium wanted to get\r\nas allies), by coming to an agreement with them; but in the siege of\r\nRhegium they suffered hardships through a scarcity of food and some\r\nother causes until Hiero by sending from Sicily grain and soldiers to\r\nthe Romans strengthened their hands and materially aided them in\r\ncapturing the city. [Sidenote: B.C. 270 (_a.u._ 484)] The place was\r\nrestored to the survivors among the original inhabitants: those who\r\nhad plotted against it were punished.\r\n\r\nHiero, who was not of distinguished family on his father's side and on\r\nhis mother's was akin to the slave class, ruled almost the whole of\r\nSicily and was deemed a friend and ally of the Romans. After the\r\nflight of Pyrrhus he became master of Syracuse, and having a cautious\r\neye upon the Carthaginians who were encroaching upon Sicily he was\r\ninclined to favor the Romans; and the first mark of favor that he\r\nshowed them was the alliance and the forwarding of grain already\r\nnarrated.\r\n\r\nAfter this came a winter so severe that the Tiber was frozen to a\r\ngreat depth and trees were killed. The people of Rome suffered\r\nhardships and the hay gave out, causing the cattle to perish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 269 (_a.u._ 485)] VIII, 7.--The next year a Samnite\r\nnamed Lolius living in Rome as a hostage made his escape, gathered a\r\nband and seized a strong position in his native country from which he\r\ncarried on brigandage. Quintus Gallus and Gaius Fabius made a\r\ncampaign against him. Him and the rabblement with him, most of them\r\nunarmed, they suppressed; on proceeding, however, against the Carcini\r\nin whose keeping the robbers had deposited their booty, they\r\nencountered trouble. Finally one night, led by deserters, they scaled\r\nthe wall at a certain point and came dangerously near perishing on\r\naccount of the darkness,--not that it was a moonless night but because\r\nit was snowing fiercely. But the moon shone out and they made\r\nthemselves absolute masters of the position.\r\n\r\nA great deal of money fell to the share of Rome in those days, so that\r\nthey actually used silver denarii.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 267 (_a.u._ 487)] Next they made a campaign into the\r\ndistrict now called Calabria. Their excuse was that the people had\r\nharbored Pyrrhus and had been overrunning their allied territory, but\r\nas a fact they wanted to gain sole possession of Brundusium, since\r\nthere was a fine harbor and for the traffic with Illyricum and Greece\r\nthe town had an approach and landing-place of such a character that\r\nvessels would sometimes come to land and put out to sea wafted by the\r\nsame wind. [Sidenote: B.C. 266 (_a.u._ 488)] They captured it and sent\r\ncolonists to it and to other settlements as well. While the\r\naccomplishment of these exploits [Sidenote: FRAG. 42] RAISED THEM TO A\r\nHIGHER PLANE OF PROSPERITY, THEY SHOWED NO HAUGHTINESS: ON THE\r\nCONTRARY THEY SURRENDERED TO THE APOLLONIATIANS ON THE IONIAN GULF\r\nQUINTUS FABIUS, A SENATOR, BECAUSE HE HAD INSULTED THEIR AMBASSADORS.\r\nBUT THESE ON RECEIVING HIM SENT HIM BACK HOME AGAIN UNHARMED.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 265 (_a.u._ 489)] In the year of the consulship of\r\nQuintus Fabius and AEmilius they went on a campaign to the Volsinii to\r\nsecure the freedom of the latter, for they were under treaty\r\nobligations to them. These people were originally a branch of the\r\nEtruscans, and they gathered power and erected an extremely strong\r\nrampart; they enjoyed also a government guided by good laws. For these\r\nreasons once, when they were involved in war with the Romans, they\r\noffered resistance for a very long time. When they had been subdued,\r\nthey deteriorated into a state of effeminacy, left the management of\r\nthe city to their servants and let those servants, as a rule, also\r\ncarry on their campaigns. Finally they encouraged them to such an\r\nextent that the servants possessed both spirit and power, and thought\r\nthey had a right to freedom. In the course of time their efforts to\r\nobtain it were crowned with success. After that they were accustomed\r\nto wed their mistresses, to inherit their masters, to be enrolled in\r\nthe senate, to secure the offices, and to hold the entire authority\r\nthemselves. Indeed, it was usual, when insults were offered them by\r\ntheir masters, for them to requite the authors of them with rather\r\nunbecoming speed. Hence the old-fashioned citizens, not being able to\r\nendure them and yet possessing no power of their own to repress them,\r\ndespatched envoys by stealth to Rome. The envoys urged the senate to\r\nconvene with secrecy at night in a private house, so that no report\r\nmight get abroad, and they obtained their request. The meeting\r\naccordingly deliberated under the idea that no one was listening: but\r\na sick Samnite, who was being entertained as a guest of the master of\r\nthe house, kept his bed unnoticed, learned what was voted, and gave\r\ninformation to those against whom charges were preferred. The latter\r\nseized and tortured the envoys on their return; when they found out\r\nwhat was on foot they killed the messengers and also some of the\r\nforemost men.\r\n\r\nThe above were the causes which led the Romans to send Fabius against\r\nthem. He routed the body of the foe that met him, destroyed many in\r\ntheir flight, shut up the remainder within the wall, and made an\r\nassault upon the city. In that action he was wounded and killed,\r\nwhereupon gaining confidence the enemy made a sortie. They were again\r\ndefeated, retired, and had to submit to siege. When they began to feel\r\nthe pangs of hunger, they surrendered. The consul delivered to outrage\r\nand death the men who had appropriated the honors of the ruling class\r\nand he razed the city to the ground; the native inhabitants, however,\r\nand many servants who had rendered valuable service to their masters\r\nhe settled on another site.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 11, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\nVIII, 8.--From that time the Romans began struggles oversea: they had\r\npreviously had no experience at all in naval matters. They now became\r\nseamen and crossed over to the islands and to other divisions of the\r\nmainland. The first people they fought against were the Carthaginians.\r\nThese Carthaginians were no whit inferior to them in wealth or in the\r\nexcellence of their land; they were trained in naval operations to a\r\ngreat degree of accuracy, were equipped with cavalry forces, with\r\ninfantry and elephants, ruled the Libyans, and held possession of both\r\nSardinia and the greater part of Sicily: as a result they had\r\ncherished hopes of subjugating Italy. Various factors contributed to\r\nincrease their self-conceit. They were especially delighted with their\r\nposition of independence: their king they elected under the title of a\r\nyearly office and not for permanent sovereignty. Animated by these\r\nconsiderations they were at the point of most zealous eagerness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 43^1] THE REASONS ALLEGED FOR THE WAR WERE--ON THE\r\nPART OF THE ROMANS THAT THE CARTHAGINIANS HAD ASSISTED THE TARENTINI,\r\nON THE PART OF THE CARTHAGINIANS THAT THE ROMANS HAD MADE A TREATY OF\r\nFRIENDSHIP WITH HIERO. THE FACT WAS, HOWEVER, THAT THEY VIEWED EACH\r\nOTHER WITH JEALOUSY AND THOUGHT THAT THE ONLY SALVATION FOR THEIR OWN\r\nPOSSESSIONS LAY IN THE POSSIBILITY OF OBTAINING WHAT THE OTHER HELD.\r\nAT A TIME WHEN THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD EACH OTHER WAS OF THIS NATURE A\r\nSLIGHT ACCIDENT THAT BEFELL BROKE THE TRUCE AND PROVOKED A CONFLICT\r\nBETWEEN THEM. This is what happened.\r\n\r\nThe Mamertines, who had once conducted a colony from Campania to\r\nMessana, were now being besieged by Hiero, and they called upon the\r\nRomans as a nation of kindred blood. The latter readily voted to aid\r\nthem, knowing that in case the Mamertines should not secure an\r\nalliance with them, they would have recourse to the Carthaginians; and\r\nthen the Carthaginians would sweep all Sicily and from there cross\r\nover into Italy. For this island is such a short distance away from\r\nthe mainland that the story goes that it was itself once a part of the\r\nmainland. [Sidenote: FRAG. 43^2] SO THE ISLAND THUS LYING OFF ITALY\r\nSEEMED TO INVITE THE CARTHAGINIANS, AND IT APPEARED AS IF THEY MIGHT\r\nLAY CLAIM TO THE LAND OVER OPPOSITE, COULD THEY BUT OCCUPY IT. AND THE\r\nPOSSESSION OF MESSANA GAVE TO ITS MASTERS THE RIGHT TO BE LORDS OF THE\r\nSTRAIT ALSO.\r\n\r\nThough the Romans voted to assist the Mamertines, they did not quickly\r\ncome to their aid because of various hindrances that occurred. Hence\r\nthe Mamertines, under the spur of necessity, called upon the\r\nCarthaginians. These brought about peace with Hiero both for\r\nthemselves and for the party that had invoked their help, so as to\r\nprevent the Romans from crossing into the island; and under the\r\nleadership of Hanno they retained the guardianship of strait and city.\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 264 (_a.u._ 490)] Meantime Gaius Claudius, military\r\ntribune, sent in advance with a few ships by Appius Claudius, had\r\narrived at Rhegium. But to sail across was more than he dared, for he\r\nsaw that the Carthaginian fleet was far larger. So he embarked in a\r\nskiff and approached Messana, where he held a conversation, as\r\nextended as the case permitted, with the party in possession. When the\r\nCarthaginians had made reply, he returned without accomplishing\r\nanything. Subsequently he ascertained that the Mamertines were at odds\r\n(they did not want to submit to the Romans, and yet they felt uneasy\r\nabout the Carthaginians), and he sailed over again. [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n43^3] AMONG OTHER REMARKS WHICH HE MADE TO TEMPT THEM HE DECLARED THAT\r\nTHE OBJECT OF HIS PRESENCE WAS TO FREE THE CITY, AND AS SOON AS HE\r\nCOULD SET THEIR AFFAIRS IN ORDER, HE SHOULD SAIL AWAY. HE BADE THE\r\nCARTHAGINIANS ALSO EITHER TO WITHDRAW, OR, IF THEY HAD ANY JUST PLEA,\r\nTO OFFER IT. NOW WHEN NOT ONE OF THE MAMERTINES (BY REASON OF FEAR)\r\nOPENED HIS LIPS, AND THE CARTHAGINIANS SINCE THEY WERE OCCUPYING THE\r\nCITY BY FORCE OF ARMS PAID NO HEED TO HIM, HE SAID: \"THE SILENCE ON\r\nBOTH SIDES AFFORDS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. IT SHOWS THAT THE ONE SIDE IS\r\nIN THE WRONG, FOR THEY WOULD HAVE JUSTIFIED THEMSELVES IF THEIR\r\nPURPOSES WERE AT ALL HONEST; AND THAT THE OTHER SIDE COVETS FREEDOM,\r\nFOR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE FREE TO SPEAK, IF THEY HAD ESPOUSED THE\r\nCAUSE OF THE CARTHAGINIANS.\" AND HE VOLUNTEERED TO AID THEM. At this a\r\ntumult of praise arose from the Mamertines. He then sailed back to\r\nRhegium and a little later with his entire fleet forced his passage\r\nacross. However, partly because of the numbers and skill of the\r\nCarthaginians, but chiefly because of the difficulty of sailing and a\r\nstorm that suddenly broke [Sidenote: FRAG. 43^4] HE LOST SOME OF HIS\r\nTRIREMES AND WITH THE REMAINDER BARELY SUCCEEDED IN GETTING BACK TO\r\nRHEGIUM.\r\n\r\nVIII, 9.--HOWEVER, THE ROMANS DID NOT SHUN THE SEA BECAUSE OF THEIR\r\nDEFEAT. Claudius proceeded to repair his ships, [Sidenote: FRAG. 43^5]\r\nWHILE HANNO, WISHING TO THROW THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR BREAKING THE\r\nTRUCE UPON THE ROMANS, SENT TO CLAUDIUS THE CAPTURED TRIREMES AND\r\nRESTORED THE CAPTIVES, URGING HIM TO AGREE TO PEACE. [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n43^6] BUT WHEN THE OTHER WOULD ACCEPT NOTHING, HE THREATENED THAT HE\r\nWOULD NEVER PERMIT THE ROMANS EVEN TO WASH THEIR HANDS IN THE SEA.\r\nClaudius now having become acquainted with the strait watched for a\r\ntime when the current and the wind both carried from Italy toward\r\nSicily, and under those circumstances sailed to the island,\r\nencountering no opposition. [Sidenote: FRAG. 43^7] HE DISCOVERED THE\r\nMAMERTINES AT THE HARBOR: HANNO HAD BEFORE BECOME SUSPICIOUS OF THEIR\r\nMOVEMENTS AND HAD ESTABLISHED HIMSELF IN THE ACROPOLIS, WHICH HE WAS\r\nGUARDING. THE ROMAN LEADER ACCORDINGLY CONVENED AN ASSEMBLY AND AFTER\r\nSOME CONVERSATION WITH THEM PERSUADED THEM TO SEND FOR HANNO. THE\r\nLATTER REFUSED TO COME DOWN, but filled with a subsequent fear that\r\nthe Mamertines might allege injustice on his part and revolt he did\r\nenter the assembly. After many words had been spoken to no purpose by\r\nboth sides, one of the Romans seized him and, with the approval of the\r\nMamertines, threw him into prison.\r\n\r\nThus, under compulsion, Hanno left Messana entirely. The Carthaginians\r\ndisciplined him and sent a herald to the Romans bidding them leave\r\nMessana and depart from all of Sicily by a given day; they also set\r\nan army in motion. Since the Romans paid no heed, they put to death\r\nthe mercenaries serving with them who were from Italy, and made an\r\nassault upon Messana, Hiero accompanying them. Then for a season they\r\nbesieged the city and kept guard over the strait, to prevent any\r\ntroops or provisions being conveyed to the foe. The consul was\r\ninformed of this when he was already quite close at hand, and found a\r\nnumber of Carthaginians disposed at various points in and about the\r\nharbor under pretence of carrying on trade. In order to get safe\r\nacross the strait he resorted to deception and did succeed in\r\nanchoring off Sicily by night. His point of approach was not far from\r\nthe camp of Hiero and he joined battle without delay, thinking that\r\nhis appearance in force would be most likely to inspire the enemy with\r\nfear. When they came out to withstand the attack, the Roman cavalry\r\nwas worsted but the heavy-armed infantry prevailed. Hiero retired\r\ntemporarily to the mountains and later to Syracuse.\r\n\r\nWhen Hiero had retired, the Mamertines took courage because of the\r\npresence of Claudius. He therefore assailed the Carthaginians, who\r\nwere now isolated, and their rampart, which was situated on a kind of\r\npeninsula. For on the one side the sea enclosed it and on the other\r\nsome marshes, difficult to traverse. At the neck of this peninsula,\r\nthe only entrance and a very narrow one, a cross wall had been built.\r\nIn an attempt to carry this point by force the Romans fared badly and\r\nwithdrew under a shower of weapons. [Sidenote: FRAG. 43^9] THE\r\nLIBYANS THEN TOOK COURAGE AND SALLIED OUT, PURSUING THE FUGITIVES, AS\r\nTHEY THOUGHT THEM, BEYOND THE NARROW STRIP OF LAND. THEREUPON THE\r\nROMANS WHEELED, ROUTED THEM, AND KILLED A NUMBER, SO THAT THEY DID NOT\r\nISSUE FROM THE CAMP AGAIN,--AT LEAST SO LONG AS CLAUDIUS WAS IN\r\nMESSANA. He, however, not daring to attack the approach in force, left\r\na detachment behind in Messana and turned his steps toward Syracuse\r\nand Hiero. He personally superintended the assault upon the city, and\r\nnow and then the inhabitants would come out to battle. Each side would\r\nsometimes be victorious and sometimes incur defeat. One day the consul\r\ngot into a confined position and would have been caught, had he not,\r\nbefore being surrounded, sent to Hiero an invitation to agree to some\r\nterms. When the representative came with whom he was to conclude the\r\nterms, he kept falling back unobtrusively, while he conversed with\r\nhim, until he had retired to safety. But the city could not easily be\r\ntaken, and a siege, on account of scarcity of food supplies and\r\ndisease in the army, was impracticable. Claudius accordingly withdrew;\r\nand the Syracusans following held discussions with his scattered\r\nfollowers and would have made a truce, if Hiero also had been willing\r\nto agree to terms. The consul left behind a garrison in Messana and\r\nsailed back to Rhegium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 263 (_a.u._ 491)] As Etruscan unrest had come to a\r\nstandstill and affairs in Italy were perfectly peaceful, whereas the\r\nCarthaginian state was becoming ever greater, the Romans ordered both\r\nthe consuls to make an expedition into Sicily. Valerius Maximus and\r\nOtacilius Crassus consequently crossed over and in their progress\r\nthrough the island together and separately they won over many towns by\r\ncapitulation. When they had made the majority of places their own,\r\nthey set out for Syracuse. Hiero in terror sent a herald to them with\r\noffers: he expressed a readiness to restore the cities of which they\r\nhad been deprived, promised money, and liberated the prisoners. On\r\nthese terms he obtained peace, for the consuls thought they could\r\nsubjugate the Carthaginians more easily with his help. After reaching\r\nan agreement with him, then, they turned their attention to the\r\nremaining cities garrisoned by Carthaginians. They were repulsed from\r\nall of them except Segesta, which they took without resistance. Its\r\ninhabitants because of their relationship with the Romans (they\r\ndeclare they are descended from AEneas) slew the Carthaginians and\r\njoined the Roman alliance.\r\n\r\nVIII, 10.--On account of the winter the consuls embarked again for\r\nRhegium. The Carthaginians conveyed most of their army to Sardinia in\r\nthe intention of attacking Rome from that quarter. They would thus\r\neither rout them out of Sicily altogether or would render them weaker\r\nafter they had crossed. Yet they achieved neither the one object nor\r\nthe other. The Romans both kept guard over their own land and sent a\r\nrespectable force to Sicily with Postumius Albinus and Quintus\r\nAEmilius.[15] [Sidenote: B.C. 262 (_a.u._ 492)] On arriving in Sicily\r\nthe consuls set out for Agrigentum and there besieged Hannibal the son\r\nof Gisco. The people of Carthage, when apprised of it, sent Hanno,\r\nwith a powerful support, to aid him in the warfare. This leader\r\narrived at Heraclea, not far from Agrigentum, and was soon engaged in\r\nwar. A number of battles, but not great ones, took place. At first\r\nHanno challenged the consuls to fight, then later on the Romans\r\nchallenged him. For as long as the Romans had an abundance of food,\r\nthey did not venture to contend against a superior force, and were\r\nhoping to get possession of the city by famine; when, however, they\r\nencountered a permanent shortage of grain, they displayed a zeal for\r\ntaking risks, but Hanno showed hesitation; their eagerness led him to\r\nsuspect that he might be ambushed. Everybody therefore was satisfied\r\nto revere the Romans as easy conquerors, and Hiero, who once\r\ncooeperated with them sulkily, now sent them grain, so that even the\r\nconsuls took heart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: In Roman records these persons are known respectively as\r\nL. Postumius L. F. L. N. Megellus and Q. Mamilius Q. F. M. N.\r\nVitulus.]\r\n\r\nHanno now undertook to bring on a battle, expecting that Hannibal\r\nwould fall upon the Romans in the rear, assailing them from the wall.\r\nThe consuls learned his plan but remained inactive, and Hanno in scorn\r\napproached their intrenchments. They also sent some men to lie in\r\nambush behind him. When toward evening he fearlessly and\r\ncontemptuously led a charge, the Romans joined battle with him from\r\nambush and from palisade and wrought a great slaughter of the enemy\r\nand of the elephants besides. Hannibal had in the meantime assailed\r\nthe Roman tents, but was hurled back by the men guarding them. Hanno\r\nabandoned his camp and made good his escape to Heraclea. Hannibal then\r\nformed a plan to escape as runaways from Agrigentum by night, and\r\nhimself eluded observation; the rest, however, were recognized and\r\nwere killed, some by the Romans and many by the Agrigentinians. For\r\nall that the people of Agrigentum did not obtain pardon, but their\r\nwealth was plundered and they themselves were all sold into servitude.\r\n\r\nOn account of the winter the consuls retired to Messana. The\r\nCarthaginians were angry with Hanno and despatched Hamilcar the son of\r\nBarca in his stead, a man superior in generalship to all his\r\ncountrymen save only Hannibal his son. [Sidenote: B.C. 261 (_a.u._\r\n493)] Hamilcar himself guarded Sicily and sent Hannibal as admiral to\r\ndamage the coast sections of Italy and so draw the consuls to his\r\nvicinity. Yet he did not accomplish his aim, for they posted guards\r\nalong both shores and then went to Sicily. They effected nothing\r\nworthy of record, however. And Hamilcar, becoming afraid that his\r\nGallic mercenaries (who were offended because he had not given them\r\nfull pay) might go over to the Romans, brought about their\r\ndestruction. He sent them to take charge of one of the cities under\r\nRoman sway, assuring them that it was in course of being betrayed and\r\ngiving them permission to plunder it: he then sent to the consuls\r\npretended deserters to give them advance information of the coming of\r\nthe Gauls. Hence all the Gauls were ambuscaded and destroyed; many of\r\nthe Romans also perished.\r\n\r\nAfter the consuls had departed home Hamilcar sailed to Italy and\r\nravaged the land and won over some cities in Sicily. On receipt of\r\nthis information the Romans [Sidenote: B.C. 260 (_a.u._ 494)]\r\ngathered a fleet and put one of the consuls, Gaius Duillius, in\r\ncommand of it, while they sent his colleague, Gaius[16] Cornelius, to\r\nSicily. He, neglecting the war on land which had fallen to his lot,\r\nsailed with the ships that belonged to him to Lipara, on the\r\nunderstanding that it was to be betrayed to him. Through treachery it\r\nhad fallen into the hands of the Carthaginians. When, therefore, he\r\nput into Lipara, Bodes the lieutenant of Hannibal closed in upon him.\r\nAs Gaius[17] made preparations to defend himself, Bodes fearing the\r\nRomans' desperation invited them to discuss terms. Having persuaded\r\nthem to do so he took the consul and military tribunes, who supposed\r\nthey were to meet the admiral, on board his own trireme. These men he\r\nsent to Carthage: the rest he captured without their so much as\r\nlifting a weapon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: This name should in both cases be Gnaeus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: [See previous footnote.]]\r\n\r\nVIII, 11.--Then Hannibal continued the ravaging of Italy, while\r\nHamilcar made a campaign against Segesta, where the Romans had most of\r\ntheir infantry force. Gaius Caecilius, a military tribune, wanted to\r\nassist them, but Hamilcar waylaid him and slaughtered many of his\r\nfollowers. The people of Rome learning this at once sent out the\r\npraetor urbanus and incited Duillius to haste. On coming to Sicily he\r\nlearned the fact that the ships of the Carthaginians were inferior to\r\nhis own in stoutness and size, but excelled in the quickness of their\r\nrowing and variety of movement. Therefore he fitted out his triremes\r\nwith mechanical devices,--anchors and grappling irons with long spikes\r\nand other such things,--in order that by laying hold of the hostile\r\nships with these they might pin them fast to their own vessels; then\r\nby crossing over into them they might have a hand to hand conflict\r\nwith the Carthaginians and engage them just as in an infantry battle.\r\nWhen the Carthaginians began the fight with the Roman ships, they\r\nsailed round and round them using the oars rapidly and would make\r\nsudden dashes. So for the time the conflict was an evenly matched one:\r\nlater the Romans got the upper hand and sank numbers of crews,\r\nretaining possession also of large numbers. Hannibal conducted the\r\nfight on a boat of seven banks, but when his own ship became entangled\r\nwith a trireme, he feared capture, hastily left the seven banked\r\naffair, and transferring to another ship effected his escape.\r\n\r\nThis was the way, then, that the naval battle resulted, and much spoil\r\nwas taken. [Sidenote: FRAG. 43^13] THE CARTHAGINIANS WOULD HAVE PUT\r\nHANNIBAL TO DEATH ON ACCOUNT OF THE DEFEAT, IF HE HAD NOT IMMEDIATELY\r\nENQUIRED OF THEM WHETHER, GRANTED THAT THE BUSINESS WERE STILL\r\nUNTOUCHED, THEY WOULD BID HIM RISK A SEA-FIGHT OR NOT. THEY AGREED\r\nTHAT HE OUGHT TO FIGHT, FOR THEY PRIDED THEMSELVES UPON HAVING A\r\nSUPERIOR NAVY. HE THEN ADDED: \"I, THEN, HAVE DONE NO WRONG, FOR\r\nI WENT INTO THE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE SAME HOPES AS YOU. IT WAS THE\r\nDECISION, BUT NOT THE FORTUNE OF THE BATTLE THAT HAPPENED TO BE\r\nWITHIN MY POWER.\" So he saved his life, but was deprived of his\r\ncommand.--Duillius after securing a reinforcement of infantry rescued\r\nthe people of Segesta, and Hamilcar would not venture to come into\r\nclose conflict with him. He strengthened the loyalty of the other\r\nfriendly settlements and returned to Rome at the close of autumn. Upon\r\nhis departure Hamilcar took forcible possession of the place called\r\nDrepanum (it is a convenient roadstead), deposited there the objects\r\nof greatest value and transferred to it all the people of Eryx. The\r\ncity of the latter, because it was a strong point, he razed to the\r\nground to prevent the Romans from seizing it and making it a base of\r\noperations for the war. He captured some cities, too, some by force,\r\nsome by betrayal; and if Gaius Florus who wintered there had not\r\nrestrained him, he would have subjugated Sicily entire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 259 (_a.u._ 495)] Lucius Scipio, his colleague, made a\r\ncampaign against Sardinia and against Corsica. These islands are\r\nsituated in the Tyrrhenian sea only a short distance apart,--so short\r\na distance, in fact, that from a little way off they seem to be one.\r\nHis first landing place was Corsica. There he captured by force\r\nValeria, its largest city, and subdued the remainder of the region\r\nwithout effort. As he was sailing toward Sardinia he descried a\r\nCarthaginian fleet and directed his course to it. The enemy fled\r\nbefore a battle could be joined and he came to the city of Olbia.\r\nThere the Carthaginians put in an appearance along with their ships,\r\nand Scipio being frightened (for he had no infantry worthy the\r\nmention) set sail for home.\r\n\r\nThese were the days when the Samnites with the cooeperation of other\r\ncaptives and slaves in the city came to an agreement to form a\r\nconspiracy against Rome. Numbers of them had been brought there with\r\na view to their utilization in the equipment of the fleet. Herius\r\nPotilius, the leader of the auxiliary force, found it out and\r\npretended to be of like mind with them, in order that he might fully\r\ninform himself in regard to what they had determined. As he was not\r\nable to give knowledge of the affair,--for all those about him were\r\nSamnites,--he persuaded them to gather in the Forum at a time when a\r\nsenate meeting was being convened and denounce him with declarations\r\nthat they were being wronged in the matter of the grain which they\r\nwere receiving. They did this and he was sent for as being the cause\r\nof the tumult; and he then laid bare to the Romans the plot. For the\r\nmoment they merely dismissed the protestants (after they had become\r\nquiet) but by night all of those who held slaves arrested some of\r\nthem. And in this way the entire conspiracy was overthrown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 253 (_a.u._ 496)] The following summer the Romans and\r\nthe Carthaginians fought in Sicily and Sardinia at once. Somewhat\r\nlater Atilius Latinus[18] went to Sicily and finding a city named\r\nMytistratus being besieged by Florus he made use of the latter's\r\nsupport. He made assaults upon the circuit of the wall which the\r\nnatives with the help of the Carthaginians at first withstood\r\nvigorously, but when the women and children were moved to tears and\r\nlaments they abandoned resistance. The Carthaginians passed out\r\nsecretly by night and at daybreak the natives voluntarily swung the\r\ngates wide open. The Romans went in and proceeded to slaughter them\r\nall till Atilius made proclamation that the remainder of the booty\r\nand the human beings belonged to him who might take them. Forthwith\r\nthey spared the lives of the remaining captives and after pillaging\r\nthe city burned it to the ground.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: A. Atilius Calatinus is meant.]\r\n\r\nVIII, 12.--Thence they proceeded heedlessly against Camarina and came\r\ninto a region where an ambuscade had already been set. They would have\r\nperished utterly, had not Marcus Calpurnius, serving as military\r\ntribune, matched the catastrophe by his cleverness. He saw that one\r\nand one only of the surrounding hills had by reason of its steepness\r\nnot been occupied and he asked of the consul three hundred heavy-armed\r\nmen and with them he set out for that point. His purpose was to make\r\nthe enemy turn their attention to his detachment so that then the rest\r\nof the Romans might make their escape. And so it happened; for when\r\nthe adversaries saw his project, they were thunderstruck and left the\r\nconsul and his followers as men already captured in order to make a\r\nunited rush upon Calpurnius. A fierce battle ensued in which many of\r\nthe opposing side and all the three hundred fell. Calpurnius alone\r\nsurvived. He had been wounded and lay unnoticed among the heaps of\r\nslain, being as good as dead by reason of his wounds; afterward he was\r\nfound alive and his life was saved. While the three hundred were\r\nfighting, the consul got away; and after this escape he reduced\r\nCamarina and other cities, some by force and some by capitulation.\r\nNext Atilius set out against Lipara. But Hamilcar at night by stealth\r\noccupied it in advance and by making a sudden sally killed many\r\nRomans.\r\n\r\nGaius Sulpicius overran the most of Sardinia and filled with arrogance\r\nas a result he set out for Libya. The Carthaginians, alarmed for the\r\nsafety of their home population, also set sail with Hannibal,\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 43^14] BUT AS A CONTRARY WIND WAS ENCOUNTERED BOTH\r\nLEADERS TURNED BACK. SUBSEQUENTLY ATILIUS[19] BROUGHT ABOUT HANNIBAL'S\r\nDEFEAT THROUGH SOME FALSE DESERTERS who pretended that Atilius[20] was\r\ngoing to sail to Libya again. Hannibal weighed anchor and came out\r\nwith speed, whereupon Sulpicius sailed to meet him and sank the\r\nmajority of his vessels, which, because of a mist, did not know for a\r\nlong time what was taking place and were thrown into confusion; all\r\nthat made their escape to land he seized, though minus their crews,\r\nfor Hannibal who saw that the harbor was unsafe abandoned them and\r\nretired to the city of Sulci. There the Carthaginians engaged in\r\nmutiny against their leader and he came forth before them alone and\r\nwas slain. The Romans in consequence overran the country with greater\r\nease, but were defeated by Hanno. This is what took place that year.\r\nAlso stones in great quantities at once, and in appearance something\r\nlike hail, fell from heaven upon Rome continually. It likewise came to\r\npass that stones descended upon Albanum and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Apparently a mistake for _Sulpicius_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: [See previous footnote.]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 257 (_a.u._ 497)] The consuls on coming to Sicily made\r\na campaign against Lipara. Perceiving the Carthaginians lying in the\r\nharbor below the height called Tyndaris they divided their expedition\r\nin two. One of the consuls with half the fleet surrounded the\r\npromontory, and Hamilcar thinking them an isolated force set sail.\r\nWhen the rest came up, he turned to flight and lost most of his fleet.\r\nThe Romans were elated, and feeling that Sicily was already theirs\r\nthey left it and ventured to make an attempt on Libya and Carthage.\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 43^16] THEIR LEADERS WERE MARCUS REGULUS AND LUCIUS\r\nMANLIUS, PREFERRED BEFORE OTHERS FOR THEIR EXCELLENCE. [Sidenote: B.C.\r\n256 (_a.u._ 498)] These two sailed to Sicily, settled affairs there,\r\nand made ready for the voyage to Libya: the Carthaginians did not wait\r\nfor their hostile voyage to begin, but after due preparation hastened\r\ntoward Sicily. Off Heracleotis the opposing forces met. The contest\r\nwas for a long time evenly balanced but in the end the Romans got the\r\nbest of it. Hamilcar did not dare to withstand their progress,\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 43^17] BUT SENT HANNO TO THEM PRETENDEDLY IN BEHALF\r\nOF PEACE, WHEREAS HE REALLY WISHED TO USE UP TIME; HE WAS IN HOPES\r\nTHAT AN ARMY WOULD BE SENT TO HIM FROM HOME. WHEN SOME CLAMORED FOR\r\nHANNO'S ARREST, BECAUSE THE CARTHAGINIANS HAD ALSO TREACHEROUSLY\r\nARRESTED CORNELIUS, the envoy said: \"If you do this, you will be no\r\nlonger any better than Libyans.\" He, therefore, by flattering them\r\nmost opportunely escaped any kind of molestation: the Romans, however,\r\nagain took up the war. And the consuls sailed from Messana, while\r\nHamilcar and Hanno separated and studied how to enclose them from both\r\nsides. Hanno, however, would not stand before them when they\r\napproached, but sailed away betimes to the harbor of Carthage and\r\nkept constant guard of the city. Hamilcar, apprised of this, stayed\r\nwhere he was. The Romans disembarked on land and marched against the\r\ncity Aspis, whose inhabitants, seeing them approaching, slipped out\r\nquietly and in good season. The Romans thus occupied it without\r\nstriking a blow and made it a base in the war. From it they ravaged\r\nthe country and acquired cities, some of their own free will and\r\nothers by intimidation. They also kept securing great booty, receiving\r\nvast numbers of deserters, and getting back many of their own men who\r\nhad been captured in the previous wars.\r\n\r\nVIII, 13.--Winter came on and Manlius sailed back to Rome with the\r\nbooty, whereas Regulus remained behind in Libya. The Carthaginians\r\nfound themselves in the depths of woe, since their country was being\r\npillaged and their vassals alienated; but cooped up in their\r\nfortifications they remained inactive. [Sidenote: (FRAG. 43^18?)]\r\nWHILE REGULUS WAS BESIDE THE BAGRADAS RIVER A SERPENT OF HUGE BULK\r\nAPPEARED TO HIM, THE LENGTH OF WHICH IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ONE HUNDRED\r\nAND TWENTY FEET. ITS SLOUGH WAS CARRIED TO ROME FOR EXHIBITION\r\nPURPOSES. AND THE REST OF ITS BODY CORRESPONDED IN SIZE. It destroyed\r\nmany of the soldiers that approached it and some also who were\r\ndrinking from the river. Regulus overcame it by a crowd of soldiers\r\nand hurling-engines. After thus destroying it he gave battle by night\r\nto Hamilcar, who was encamped upon a high, woody spot; and he slew\r\nmany in their beds as well as many who had just risen. Any who escaped\r\nfell in with Romans guarding the roads, who despatched them. In this\r\nway a large division of Carthaginians was blotted out and numerous\r\ncities went over to the Romans. [Sidenote: FRAG. 43^19] THOSE IN THE\r\nTOWN BEING IN FEAR OF CAPTURE SENT HERALDS TO THE CONSUL TO THE END\r\nTHAT HAVING BY SOME SATISFACTORY ARRANGEMENT INDUCED HIM TO GO AWAY\r\nTHEY MIGHT AVOID THE DANGER OF THE MOMENT AND SO ESCAPE. BUT WHEN MANY\r\nUNREASONABLE DEMANDS WERE MADE OF THEM, THEY DECIDED THAT THE TRUCE\r\nWOULD MEAN THEIR UTTER SUBJUGATION AND PREPARED RATHER TO FIGHT.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 255 (_a.u._ 499)] Regulus, however, who up to that\r\ntime was fortunate, became filled with boastfulness and conceit, so\r\nmuch so that he even wrote to Rome that he had sealed up the gates of\r\nCarthage with fear. His followers and the people of Rome thought the\r\nsame way, and this caused their undoing. Allies of various sorts came\r\nto the Carthaginians, among them Xanthippus from Sparta. He assumed\r\nthe general superintendence of the Carthaginians, for the populace was\r\neager to entrust matters to his charge and Hamilcar together with the\r\nother officials stepped aside voluntarily. The new leader, then,\r\ndisposed things excellently in every way, and particularly he brought\r\nthe Carthaginians down from the heights, where they were staying\r\nthrough fear, into the level country, where their horses and elephants\r\nwere sure to develop greatest power. For some time he remained\r\ninactive until at length he found the Romans encamped in a way that\r\nbetokened their contempt. They were very haughty over their victorious\r\nprogress and looked down upon Xanthippus as a \"Graecus\" (this is a name\r\nthey give to Hellenes and they use this epithet as a reproach to them\r\nfor their mean birth); [Sidenote: B.C. 255 (_a.u._ 499)] consequently\r\nthey had constructed their camp in a heedless fashion. While the\r\nRomans were in this situation, Xanthippus assailed them, routed their\r\ncavalry with his elephants, cut down many and captured many alive,\r\namong them Regulus himself. This put the Carthaginians in high\r\nspirits. They saved the lives of the captives in order that their own\r\ncitizens previously taken captive by the Romans might not be killed.\r\nAll the Roman prisoners were treated with consideration except\r\nRegulus, whom they kept in a state of utter misery; they offered him\r\nonly just food enough to maintain existence and they would repeatedly\r\nlead an elephant close up to him to frighten him, so that he might\r\nhave peace in neither body nor mind. After afflicting him in this way\r\nfor a good while they placed him in prison.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the Carthaginians dealt with their allies forms a\r\nchapter of great ruthlessness in this story. They were not supplied\r\nwith sufficient wealth to pay them what they had originally promised,\r\nand dismissed them with the understanding that they would pay them\r\ntheir wages before very long. To the men who escorted the allies,\r\nhowever, they issued orders to put them ashore on a desert island and\r\nquietly sail away. As to Xanthippus, one story is that they drowned\r\nhim, attacking him in boats after his boat had departed: the other is\r\nthat they gave him an old ship which was in no wise seaworthy but had\r\nbeen newly covered over with pitch outside, that it might sink quite\r\nof itself; and that he, aware of the fact, got aboard a different\r\nship and so was saved. Their reason for doing this was to avoid\r\nseeming to have been preserved by his ability; for they thought that\r\nonce he had perished the renown of his deeds would also perish.\r\n\r\nVIII, 14.--The people of Rome were grieved at the turn of events and\r\nmore especially because they were looking for the Carthaginians to\r\nsail against Rome itself. For this reason they carefully guarded Italy\r\nand hastily sent to the Romans in Sicily and Libya the consuls Marcus\r\nAEmilius and Fulvius Paetinus.[21] They after sailing to Sicily and\r\ngarrisoning the positions there started for Libya, but were overtaken\r\nby a storm and carried to Cossura. They ravaged the island and put it\r\nin charge of a garrison, then sailed onward again. Meanwhile a fierce\r\nnaval battle with the Carthaginians had taken place. The latter were\r\nstruggling to eject the Romans entirely from their native land, and\r\nthe Romans to save the remnants of their soldiers who had been left in\r\nhostile territory. In the midst of a close battle the Romans in Aspis\r\nsuddenly attacked the Carthaginians in ships from the rear, and by\r\ngetting them between two forces overcame them. Later the Romans also\r\nwon an infantry engagement and took many prisoners, whose lives they\r\nsaved because of Regulus and those captured with him. They made\r\nseveral raids and then sailed to Sicily. After encountering a storm,\r\nhowever, and losing many of their number, they sailed for home with\r\nthe ships that remained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Zonaras spells _Plaetinus_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 254 (_a.u._ 500)] The Carthaginians took Cossura and\r\ncrossed over to Sicily; and had they not learned that Collatinus[22]\r\nand Gnaeus Cornelius were approaching with a large fleet, they would\r\nhave subjugated the whole of it. The Romans had quickly fitted out a\r\nfirst-class fleet, had made levies of their best men, and had become\r\nso strong that in the third month they returned to Sicily. It was the\r\nfive hundredth year from the founding of Rome. The lower city of\r\nPanhormus they took without trouble, but in the siege of the citadel\r\nthey fared badly until food failed those in it. Then they came to\r\nterms with the consuls. [Sidenote: FRAG. 43^20] THE CARTHAGINIANS KEPT\r\nWATCH FOR THEIR SHIPS HOMEWARD BOUND AND CAPTURED SEVERAL THAT WERE\r\nFULL OF MONEY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: This is A. Atilius Calatinus again.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 253 (_a.u._ 501)] The next event was that Servilius\r\nCaepio and Gaius Sempronius, consuls, made an attempt upon Lilybaeum\r\n(from which they were repulsed) and crossing over to Libya ravaged the\r\ncoast districts. As they were returning homeward they encountered a\r\nstorm and incurred damage. Hence the people, thinking that the damage\r\nwas due to their inexperience in naval affairs, voted that they should\r\nkeep away from the sea in general but with a few ships should guard\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 252 (_a.u._ 502)] In the succeeding year Publius\r\nGaius[23] and Aurelius Servilius[24] came to Sicily and subdued Himera\r\nbesides some other places. However, they did not get possession of any\r\nof its inhabitants, for the Carthaginians conveyed them away by night.\r\nAfter this Aurelius secured some ships from Hiero and adding to his\r\ncontingent all the Romans that were there he sailed to Lipara. Here\r\nhe left the tribune Quintus Cassius,[25] who was to keep a lookout but\r\navoid a battle, and set sail for home. Quintus, disregarding orders,\r\nmade an attack upon the city and lost many men. Aurelius, however,\r\nsubsequently took the place, killed all the inhabitants, and deposed\r\nCassius from his command.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: A mistake for Gaius Aurelius and Publius Servilius, as\r\nat the beginning of Chapter 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: [See previous footnote.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: But Valerius Maximus (II, 7, 4) calls him P. Aurelius\r\nPecuniola.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 251 (_a.u._ 503)] The Carthaginians learned what the\r\nRomans had determined regarding the fleet and sent an expedition to\r\nSicily hoping now to bring it entirely under their control. As long as\r\nboth consuls, Caecilius Metellus and Gaius Furius, were on the ground,\r\nthey remained quiet; but when Furius set out for Rome, they conceived\r\na contempt for Metellus and proceeded to Panhormus. Metellus\r\nascertained that spies had come from the enemy, and assembling all the\r\npeople of the city he began a talk with them, in the midst of which he\r\nsuddenly ordered them to lay hold of one another. He was thus enabled\r\nto investigate who each one was and what was his business and so\r\ndetected the enemy.--The Carthaginians now set themselves in battle\r\narray and Metellus pretended to be afraid. As he continued this\r\npretence for several days the Carthaginians became filled with\r\npresumption and attacked him rather recklessly. Then Metellus raised\r\nthe signal for the Romans. Forthwith they made an unexpected rush\r\nthrough all the gates, easily overcame resistance, and enclosed the\r\nenemy in a narrow place through which they could now no longer\r\nretreat. Being many in number and with many elephants along they were\r\nhuddled together and thrown into confusion. Meanwhile the Libyan fleet\r\napproached the coast and became the prime cause of their destruction.\r\nThe fugitives seeing the ships rushed toward them and made desperate\r\nexertions to climb aboard; some fell into the sea and perished, other\r\nwere killed by the elephants, which got close to one another and to\r\nthe human beings, still others were slain by the Romans; many also\r\nwere captured alive, men as well as elephants. For since the beasts,\r\nbereft of the men to whom they were used, became furious, Metellus\r\nmade a proclamation to the prisoners, offering preservation and\r\nforgiveness to such as would check them: accordingly, some keepers\r\napproached the gentlest of the animals, controlling them by the\r\ninfluence of their accustomed presence, and then won over the\r\nremainder. These, one hundred and twenty in number, were conveyed to\r\nRome, and they were ferried across the strait in the following way. A\r\nnumber of huge jars, separated by pieces of wood, were fastened\r\ntogether in such a way that they were neither detached nor yet did\r\nthey touch; then this framework was spanned by beams and on the top of\r\nall earth and brush were placed and the surface was fenced in round\r\nabout so that it resembled a courtyard. The beasts were put on board\r\nthis and were ferried across without knowing that they were moving on\r\nthe water. Thus did Metellus win a victory: Hasdrubal, the\r\nCarthaginian leader, though he got away safe on this occasion was\r\nlater summoned to trial by the Carthaginians at home and suffered\r\nimpalement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 43^21] VIII, 15.--THE CARTHAGINIANS NOW BEGAN\r\nNEGOTIATIONS WITH THE ROMANS ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT NUMBER OF THE\r\nCAPTIVES (AMONG OTHER CAUSES); AND WITH THE ENVOYS THEY ALSO SENT\r\nREGULUS HIMSELF, THINKING THAT THROUGH HIM THEIR OBJECT HAD\r\nPRACTICALLY BEEN ALREADY GAINED BECAUSE OF THE REPUTATION AND VALOR OF\r\nTHE MAIN: AND THEY BOUND HIM BY OATHS TO RETURN WITHOUT FAIL. AND HE\r\nACTED IN ALL RESPECTS LIKE ONE OF THE CARTHAGINIANS; FOR HE DID NOT\r\nEVEN GRANT HIS WIFE LEAVE TO CONFER WITH HIM NOR DID HE ENTER THE CITY\r\nALTHOUGH REPEATEDLY INVITED TO DO SO; INSTEAD, WHEN THE SENATE WAS\r\nASSEMBLED OUTSIDE THE WALLS, AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO IN TREATING\r\nWITH ENVOYS OF THE ENEMY, and he was introduced into the gathering, he\r\nsaid: \"We, Conscript Fathers, have been sent to you by the\r\nCarthaginians. They it was who despatched me on this journey, since by\r\nthe law of war I have become their slave. They ask, if possible, to\r\nconclude the war upon terms pleasing to both parties or, if not, to\r\neffect an exchange of prisoners.\" At the end of these words he\r\nwithdrew with the envoys that the Romans might deliberate in private.\r\nWhen the consuls urged him to take part in their discussion,\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 43^22] HE PAID NO HEED UNTIL PERMISSION WAS GRANTED\r\nBY THE CARTHAGINIANS. For a time he was silent. Then, as the senators\r\nbade him state his opinion, he spoke:\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 12, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n\"I am one of you, Conscript Fathers, though I be captured times\r\nwithout number. My body is a Carthaginian chattel, but my spirit is\r\nyours. The former has been alienated from you, but the latter nobody\r\nhas the power to make anything else than Roman. As captive I belong to\r\nthe Carthaginians, yet, as I met with misfortune not from cowardice\r\nbut from zeal, I am not only a Roman, but my heart is in your cause.\r\nNot in a single respect do I think reconciliation advantageous to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these words Regulus stated also the reasons for which he favored\r\nrejecting the proposals, and added: \"I know, to be sure, that manifest\r\ndestruction confronts me, for it is impossible to keep them from\r\nlearning the advice I have given; but even so I esteem the public\r\nadvantage above my own safety. If any one shall say: 'Why do you not\r\nrun away, or stay here?' he shall be told that I have sworn to them to\r\nreturn and I would not transgress my oaths, not even when they have\r\nbeen given to enemies. There are various explanations for this, but\r\nthe principal one is that if I abide by my oath I alone shall suffer\r\ndisaster, but if I break it, the whole city will be involved.\"\r\n\r\nBut the senate out of consideration for his safety showed a\r\ndisposition to make peace and to restore the captives. When he was\r\nmade aware of this, he pretended, in order that he might not be the\r\ncause of their letting slip their advantage, that he had swallowed\r\ndeadly poison and was destined certainly to die from its effects.\r\nHence no agreement and no exchange of prisoners was made. As he was\r\ndeparting in company with the envoys, his wife and children and others\r\nclung to him, and the consuls declared they would not surrender him,\r\nif he chose to stay, nor yet would they detain him if he was for\r\ndeparting. Consequently, since he preferred not to transgress the\r\noaths, he was carried back. He died of outrages, so the legend\r\nreports, perpetrated by his captors. They cut off his eyelids and for\r\na time shut him in darkness, then they threw him into some kind of\r\nspecially constructed receptacle bristling with spikes; and they made\r\nhim face the sun; so that through suffering and sleeplessness,--for\r\nthe spikes kept him from reclining in any fashion,--he perished. When\r\nthe Romans found it out, they delivered the foremost captives that\r\nthey held to his children to outrage and put to death in revenge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 250 (_a.u._ 504)] They voted that the consuls, Atilius\r\nGaius, brother of Regulus, and Lucius Manlius, should make a campaign\r\ninto Libya. On coming to Sicily they attacked Lilybaeum and undertook\r\nto fill up a portion of the ditch to facilitate bringing up the\r\nengines. The Carthaginians dug below the mound and undermined it. As\r\nthey found this to be a losing game because of the numbers of the\r\nopposing workmen, they built another wall, crescent-shaped, inside.\r\nThe Romans ran tunnels under the circle, in order that when the wall\r\nsettled they might rush in through the breach thus made. The\r\nCarthaginians then built counter-tunnels and came upon many workers\r\nwho were unaware of what the other side was doing. These they killed,\r\nand also destroyed many by hurling blazing firewood into the diggings.\r\nSome of the allies now, burdened by the strain of the siege and\r\ndispleased because their superiors did not come down with their full\r\nwages, made propositions to the Romans to betray the place. Hamilcar\r\ndiscovered their plot but did not disclose it, for fear of driving\r\nthem into open hostility. However, he supplied their leaders with\r\nmoney and in addition promised other supplies of it to the mass of\r\nthem. In this way he won their favor, and they did not even deny their\r\ntreachery but drove away the last envoys who returned. The latter then\r\ndeserted to the consuls and received from them land in Sicily and\r\nother gifts.\r\n\r\nThe Carthaginians at home, hearing this, sent Adherbal with a very\r\nlarge number of ships carrying grain and money to Lilybaeum. The leader\r\nwaited for a time of storm and sailed in. Thereupon many others\r\nlikewise ventured to attempt a landing, and some made it, others were\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nAs long as both the consuls were present, the conflicts were even.\r\nPestilence and famine, however, came to harass them and these caused\r\none of them with the soldiers of his division to return home. Hamilcar\r\nthen took courage and made sorties in which he would set fire to the\r\nengines and slay the men defending them; his cavalry, starting from\r\nDrepanum, prevented the Romans from getting provisions and overran the\r\nterritory of their allies; and Adherbal ravaged the shores now of\r\nSicily, now of Italy, so that the Romans fell into perplexity.\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 249 (_a.u._ 505)] Meantime, however, Lucius Junius was\r\nmaking ready a fleet, and Claudius Pulcher made haste to reach\r\nLilybaeum, where he manned ships of war. With these he overhauled Hanno\r\nthe Carthaginian as he was leaving harbor on a five-banked ship. The\r\nprize craft served the Romans as a model in shipbuilding.\r\n\r\nThe interests of their fleet were so frequently endangered that the\r\nRomans were disheartened by the constant destruction of their ships.\r\nIn these they lost numbers of men and vast sums of money. Yet they\r\nwould not give up; nay, they even executed a man who in the senate\r\nopened his mouth about reconciliation with the Carthaginians, and they\r\nvoted that a dictator should be named. Collatinus[26] was therefore\r\nnamed dictator and Metellus became master of the horse, but they\r\naccomplished nothing worthy of remembrance. While Collatinus[27] was\r\nbeing named dictator, Junius had won over Eryx, and Carthalo had\r\noccupied AEgithallus and taken Junius alive.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _A. Atilius Calatinus_ once more.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: [See previous footnote.]]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 248 (_a.u._ 506)] VIII, 16.--The next year Gaius\r\nAurelius and Publius Servilius took office and spent their time in\r\nharrying Lilybaeum and Drepanum, in keeping the Carthaginians off the\r\nland, and in devastating the region that was in alliance with them.\r\nCarthalo undertook many different kinds of enterprises against them,\r\nbut, as he accomplished nothing, he started for Italy with the object\r\nof thus attracting the consuls to that country or, in any case, of\r\ninjuring the district and capturing cities. Yet he made no headway\r\neven there and on learning that the praetor urbanus was approaching\r\nsailed back to Sicily. His mercenaries now rebelled about a question\r\nof pay, whereupon he put numbers ashore on desert islands and left\r\nthem there, and sent many more off to Carthage. When the rest heard\r\nthis, they became indignant and were on the point of an uprising.\r\nHamilcar, Carthalo's successor, cut down numbers of them one night and\r\nhad numerous others drowned. In the meantime the Romans had concluded\r\na perpetual friendship with Hiero and they furthermore remitted all\r\nthe dues which they were accustomed to receive from him annually.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 247 (_a.u._ 507)] Next year the Romans officially\r\nrefrained from naval warfare because of their misfortunes and\r\nexpenses, but some private individuals asked for ships on condition of\r\nrestoring the vessels but appropriating any booty gained; and among\r\nother injuries that they inflicted upon the enemy they sailed to\r\nHippo, a Libyan city, and there burned to ashes all the boats and many\r\nof the buildings. The natives put chains across the mouth of their\r\nharbor and the invaders found themselves encompassed but saved\r\nthemselves by cleverness and good fortune. They made a quick dash at\r\nthe chains, and just as the beaks of the ships were about to catch in\r\nthem the members of the crew went back to the stern, and so the prows\r\nbeing lightened cleared the chains: and again, by their making a rush\r\ninto the prows, the sterns of the vessels were lifted high enough in\r\nthe air. Thus they effected their escape, and later near Panhormus\r\nthey conquered the Carthaginians with these ships.\r\n\r\nOf the consuls Metellus Caecilius was in the vicinity of Lilybaeum, and\r\nNumerius Fabius was investing Drepanum, with additional designs upon\r\nthe islet of Pelias. As this had been seized earlier by the\r\nCarthaginians, he sent soldiers by night who killed the garrison and\r\ntook possession of the island. Learning this Hamilcar at dawn attacked\r\nthe party that had crossed to it. Fabius not being able to ward them\r\noff led an assault upon Drepanum that he might either capture the city\r\nwhile deserted or bring back Hamilcar from the island. One of these\r\nobjects was accomplished, for Hamilcar in fear retired within the\r\nfortifications. So Fabius occupied Pelias, and by filling in the\r\nstrait (which happened to be shallow) between it and the mainland he\r\nmade a clear stretch of solid ground and thus conducted with greater\r\nfacility his hostile operations against the wall, which was rather\r\nweak at that point. Incidentally the Carthaginians caused the Romans\r\nexcessive annoyance by undertaking circuitous voyages to Sicily and\r\nmaking trips across into Italy.--They exchanged each other's captives\r\nman for man; those left over (since the numbers were not equal) the\r\nCarthaginians got back for money.\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent period various persons became consuls but effected\r\nnothing worthy of record. The Romans owed the majority of their\r\nreverses to the fact that they kept sending out from year to year\r\ndifferent and ever different leaders, and took away their office from\r\nthem when they were just learning the art of generalship. It looked as\r\nif they were choosing them for practice and not for service.\r\n\r\nThe Gauls, who were acting in alliance with the Carthaginians and\r\nhated them because their masters treated them ill, abandoned to the\r\nRomans for money a position with the guarding of which they had been\r\nentrusted. The Romans secured for mercenary service the Gauls and\r\nother of the Carthaginian allies who had revolted from their service;\r\nnever before had they supported foreigners in their army. Elated at\r\nthis accession and furthermore by the ravaging of Libya on the part of\r\nthe private citizens who were managing the ships, they were no longer\r\nwilling to neglect the sea, and they again got together a fleet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 241 (_a.u._ 513)] VIII, 17.--And Lutatius Catulus was\r\nchosen consul and with him was sent out Quintus Valerius Flaccus as\r\npraetor urbanus. On coming to Sicily they assailed Drepanum both by\r\nland and by sea and demolished a section of the wall. They would have\r\ncaptured the town but for the fact that the consul was wounded and the\r\nsoldiers were wholly engrossed in caring for him. During the delay\r\nwhich ensued they learned that a body of the enemy had come from home\r\nwith a huge fleet commanded by Hanno, and they turned their attention\r\nto these new arrivals. When the forces had been marshaled in hostile\r\narray, a meteor like a star appeared above the Romans and after rising\r\nhigh to the left of the Carthaginians plunged into their ranks. The\r\nnaval combat was a vigorous one on the part of both nations, and for\r\nseveral reasons; especially were the Carthaginians anxious to drive\r\nthe Romans into complete despair of naval success, and the Romans to\r\nretrieve their former disasters. In spite of everything the Romans\r\ncarried off the victory, for the Carthaginian vessels were impeded by\r\nthe fact that they carried freight,--grain and money and other things.\r\n\r\nHanno escaped and hastened at once to Carthage. The Carthaginians,\r\nseized with wrath and fear, crucified him and sent envoys to Catulus\r\nregarding peace. And he was disposed to end the war since his office\r\nwas soon to expire and he could not hope to destroy Carthage in so\r\nshort a time; nor, again, did he care to leave his successors the\r\nglory of his own efforts. Consequently they effected an armistice by\r\ngiving him money, grain, and hostages; these preliminaries secured\r\nthem the right of sending envoys to Rome and proposing as conditions\r\nthat they retire from Sicily entire, yielding it to the Romans, as\r\nwell as abandon all the surrounding islands, that they carry on no war\r\nwith Hiero, and pay an indemnity, a part at the time of making the\r\ntreaty and a part later, and that they return the Roman deserters and\r\ncaptives free of cost, but ransom their own.\r\n\r\nSuch were the terms agreed upon. Hamilcar succeeded only in having the\r\ndisgrace of going under the yoke left out. After settling these\r\nconditions he led his soldiers out of the fortifications and sailed\r\nfor home before the oaths were imposed. The people of Rome soon\r\nlearned of the victory and were greatly elated, feeling that their\r\nsuperiority was indisputable. Upon the arrival of envoys they could no\r\nlonger restrain themselves and hoped to possess all of Libya.\r\nTherefore they would not abide by the terms of the consul: instead,\r\nthey exacted from them a very much larger sum of money than had been\r\npromised. They forbade them also to sail past Italy or allied\r\nterritory abroad in ships of war, or to employ mercenaries from such\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nThe first war between the Carthaginians and the Romans, then, ended\r\nthis way in the twenty-fourth year. Catulus celebrated a triumph over\r\nits conclusion. Quintus Lutatius became consul and departed for\r\nSicily, where with his brother Catulus he enforced order in all\r\ncommunities; and he deprived the islanders of arms. Thus Sicily, with\r\nthe exception of Hiero's domain, was made a slave of Rome, and from\r\nthis time its people were on a friendly footing with the\r\nCarthaginians.\r\n\r\nBoth soon were again involved in other wars outside. At Carthage the\r\nremnant of their mercenary force and the slave population in the city\r\nand a large proportion of their hostages (influenced by the disasters\r\nof the State) joined in an attack upon it. The Romans did not heed the\r\ninvitations to aid the party that had assumed the offensive, but sent\r\nenvoys in turn for discussion; and when they found themselves unable\r\nto reconcile the combatants, they released free of cost all the\r\nCarthaginian captives they were holding, sent grain to the city and\r\npermitted it to gather mercenaries from Roman allied territory. By\r\nthis action they were seeking to gain a reputation for fairness rather\r\nthan displaying a real interest in their own advantage, and this later\r\ncaused them trouble. For the great Hamilcar Barca, after he had\r\nconquered his adversaries, did not dare to make a campaign against the\r\nRomans, much as he hated them; but he started for Spain contrary to\r\nthe wishes of the magistrates at home.\r\n\r\nVIII, 18.--This, however, took place later. At the time under\r\ndiscussion the Romans entered upon war with the Falisci, and Manlius\r\nTorquatus ravaged their country. In a battle with them his heavy\r\ninfantry was worsted but his cavalry conquered. In a second engagement\r\nwith them he was victorious and took possession of their arms, their\r\ncavalry, their furniture, their slaves, and half their country. Later\r\non the original city, which was set upon a steep mountain, was torn\r\ndown and another one was built, easily reached by road. After this the\r\nRomans again waged wars upon the Boii and upon the Gauls that were\r\nneighbors of the latter, and upon some Ligurians. The Ligurians were\r\nconquered in battle and otherwise injured by Sempronius Gracchus:\r\nPublius Valerius in a conflict with the Gauls was at first defeated,\r\nbut soon, learning that troops had come from Rome to his assistance,\r\nhe renewed the struggle with the Gauls, determined either to conquer\r\nby his own exertions or to die--he preferred that rather than to live\r\nand bear the stigma of disgrace; and by some fortune or other he\r\nmanaged to win the day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 238 (_a.u._ 516)] At this time these events befell the\r\nRomans as described. They also secured Sardinia from the Carthaginians\r\nand a new supply of money by charging them with harming Roman\r\nshipping. The Carthaginians, not having yet recovered strength, feared\r\ntheir threats.--Next year Lucius Lentulus and Quintus Flaccus made a\r\ncampaign against the Gauls; and as long as they remained together,\r\nthey were invincible, [Sidenote: B.C. 237 (_a.u._ 517)] but when they\r\nbegan to pillage districts separately with the idea of getting greater\r\nbooty, the army of Flaccus fell into danger, being surrounded by\r\nnight. Temporarily the barbarians were beaten back, but having gained\r\naccessions of allies they proceeded anew with a huge force against the\r\nRomans. [Sidenote: B.C. 236 (_a.u._ 518)] When confronted by Publius\r\nLentulus and Licinius Varus, they hoped to overcome them by their\r\nnumbers and prevail without a battle. So they sent and demanded the\r\nland surrounding Ariminum and commanded the Romans to remove from the\r\ncity since it belonged to them. The consuls on account of their small\r\nnumbers did not dare to risk a battle nor would they take the\r\nresponsibility of releasing any territory, and accordingly they\r\narranged a truce to confer with Rome. Gallic emissaries came before\r\nthe senate with the aforementioned representations. As none of their\r\ndemands was granted, the envoys returned to camp. There they found\r\ntheir cause was ruined. Some of their allies had repented and\r\nregarding the Romans with fear had turned upon the Boii, and many had\r\nbeen killed on both sides. Then the remainder had gone home and the\r\nBoii had obtained peace only at the price of a large portion of their\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe Gallic wars having now ceased, Lentulus conducted a campaign\r\nagainst the Ligurians. He drove off the attacking parties and gained\r\npossession of several fortresses.--Varus took Corsica as his objective\r\npoint, and inasmuch as he lacked the necessary ships to carry him\r\nover, he sent a certain Claudius Clineas in advance with troops. The\r\nlatter terrified the Corsicans, held a conference with them, and made\r\npeace as though he had full authority to do so. But Varus, paying no\r\nattention to the covenant, fought against the Corsicans until he had\r\nsubjugated them. [Sidenote: FRAG. 44^2] THE ROMANS TO DIVERT THE BLAME\r\nFOR BREAKING THE COMPACT FROM THEMSELVES SENT TO THE PEOPLE OFFERING\r\nTO GIVE CLAUDIUS UP. WHEN HE WAS NOT RECEIVED, THEY DROVE HIM INTO\r\nEXILE. [Sidenote: FRAG. 45^1] THEY WERE ON THE POINT OF LEADING AN\r\nEXPEDITION AGAINST THE CARTHAGINIANS ALLEGING THAT THE LATTER WERE\r\nCOMMITTING OUTRAGES UPON THE MERCHANTS; BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THIS THEY\r\nEXACTED MONEY AND RENEWED THE TRUCE. Yet the agreements were not\r\ndestined even so to be of long standing.--The case of the\r\nCarthaginians was accordingly postponed and they made an expedition\r\nagainst the Sardinians, who would not yield obedience, and conquered\r\nthem. Subsequently the Carthaginians persuaded the Sardinians to plan\r\na secret uprising against the Romans. Besides these the Corsicans also\r\nrevolted and the Ligurians did not remain at rest.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 234 (_a.u._ 520)] The following year the Romans\r\ndivided their forces into three parts in order that all the rebels,\r\nfinding war waged upon them at once, might not render assistance to\r\none another; and they sent Postumius Albinus into Liguria, Spurius\r\nCarvilius against the Corsicans, and Publius Cornelius, the praetor\r\nurbanus, into Sardinia. And the consuls not without trouble, yet with\r\nsome speed, accomplished their missions. The Sardinians, animated by\r\nan immoderate amount of spirit, were vanquished by Carvilius in a\r\nfierce battle, for Cornelius and many of his soldiers had been\r\ndestroyed by disease. When the Romans left their country, the\r\nSardinians and the Ligurians revolted again. [Sidenote: B.C. 233\r\n(_a.u._ 521)] Quintus Fabius Maximus was accordingly sent to Ligurian\r\nterritory and Pomponius Manius into Sardinia. The Carthaginians, as\r\nthe cause of the wars, were adjudged enemies, and they sent to them\r\nand demanded money and ordained that they should remove their ships\r\nfrom all the islands, since these ports were hostile to them. In\r\nmaking known their attitude the Romans despatched to their rivals a\r\nspear and a herald's staff, bidding them choose one, whichever they\r\npleased. But the Carthaginians without shrinking made a rather rough\r\nanswer and declared that they chose neither of the articles sent them,\r\nbut were ready to accept either that the challengers might leave\r\nthere. Henceforth the two nations hated each other but hesitated to\r\nbegin war.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 232 (_a.u._ 522)] As there was again a hostile\r\nmovement of the Sardinians against the Romans, both the consuls took\r\nthe field, Marcus Malleolus and Marcus AEmilius. And they secured rich\r\nspoils, which, however, were taken away from them by the Corsicans\r\nwhen they touched at their island. Hence the Romans next turned their\r\nattention to both. [Sidenote: B.C. 231 (_a.u._ 523)] Marcus Pomponius\r\nharried Sardinia, but could not find most of the inhabitants, who, as\r\nhe learned, had slipped into caves of the forest, difficult to locate;\r\ntherefore he sent for keen-scented dogs from Italy and with their aid\r\nhe discovered the trail of both men and cattle and cut off many such\r\nparties. Gaius Papirius drove the Corsicans from the plains, but in\r\nattempting to force his way to the mountains he lost numerous men\r\nthrough ambush and would have suffered loss of still more through lack\r\nof water, had not water after a great while been found; then he\r\npersuaded the Corsicans to come to terms.\r\n\r\nVIII, 19.--About this time also Hamilcar the Carthaginian general was\r\ndefeated by the Spaniards and lost his life. For, on the occasion of\r\nhis being arrayed in battle against them, they led out in front of the\r\nCarthaginian army wagons full of pine wood and pitch and as they drew\r\nnear they set fire to these vehicles, then hurried on with goads the\r\nanimals that were drawing them. Forthwith their opponents were thrown\r\ninto confusion, were disorganized and turned to flight, and the\r\nSpaniards pursuing killed Hamilcar and a very great number of others.\r\nHe having reached the very highest pinnacle of fame thus met his end,\r\nand at his death his brother-in-law Hasdrubal succeeded him. The\r\nlatter acquired a large portion of Spain and founded a city called\r\nCarthage, after his native town.\r\n\r\nAs the Boii and the rest of the Gauls were continually offering for\r\nsale many articles and an especially large number of captives, the\r\nRomans became afraid that they might some day use the money against\r\nthem, and accordingly forbade everybody to give to a Gaul either\r\nsilver or gold coin.--[Sidenote: B.C. 230 (_a.u._ 524)] Soon after the\r\nCarthaginians,[28] learning that the consuls Marcus AEmilius and Marcus\r\nJunius had started for Liguria, made preparations to march upon Rome.\r\nThe consuls became aware of this and proceeded toward them in force,\r\nwhereupon the Carthaginians became frightened and met them with all\r\nappearances of friendliness. The consuls likewise feigned that they\r\nhad not set out against them but were going through their country into\r\nthe Ligurian territory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: This is a mistake, due to the carelessness of Zonaras.\r\nSome Gallic tribe is evidently meant.]\r\n\r\nNow the Romans crossed the Ionian Gulf and laid hands upon the Greek\r\nmainland. They found an excuse for the voyage in the following\r\ncircumstances. [Sidenote: FRAG. 47^1] ISSA IS AN ISLAND SITUATED IN\r\nTHE IONIAN GULF. ITS DWELLERS, KNOWN AS ISSAEANS, HAD OF THEIR OWN FREE\r\nWILL SURRENDERED THEMSELVES TO THE ROMANS because they were angry with\r\ntheir ruler Agro, king of the Ardiaeans and of Illyrian stock.\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 47^2] TO HIM THE CONSULS SENT ENVOYS. But he had\r\ndied, leaving a son as his successor who was still a mere child,\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 47^2] AND HIS WIFE, THE BOY'S STEPMOTHER, WAS\r\nADMINISTERING THE DOMAIN OF THE ARDIAEANS. HER DEALINGS WITH THE\r\nAMBASSADORS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY A LACK OF MODERATION, AND WHEN THEY\r\nSPOKE FRANKLY SHE CAST SOME OF THEM INTO PRISON AND KILLED OTHERS.\r\nIMMEDIATELY THE ROMANS VOTED FOR WAR AGAINST HER, HOWEVER, SHE WAS\r\nPANIC-STRICKEN, PROMISED TO RESTORE THE AMBASSADORS THAT WERE LEFT\r\nALIVE, AND DECLARED THAT THE DEAD HAD BEEN SLAIN BY ROBBERS. WHEN THE\r\nROMANS DEMANDED THE SURRENDER OF THE MURDERERS, SHE DECLARED THAT SHE\r\nWOULD NOT GIVE THEM UP AND DESPATCHED AN ARMY AGAINST ISSA. THEN SHE\r\nAGAIN GREW FEARFUL AND SENT A CERTAIN DEMETRIUS TO THE CONSULS,\r\nASSURING THEM OF HER READINESS TO HEED THEM IN EVERY DETAIL. A TRUCE\r\nWAS MADE WITH HER EMISSARY UPON THE LATTER'S AGREEING TO GIVE THEM\r\nCORCYRA. YET WHEN THE CONSULS HAD CROSSED OVER TO THE ISLAND, SHE,\r\nPOSSESSING WOMAN-LIKE A LIGHT AND FICKLE DISPOSITION, FELT IMBUED WITH\r\nNEW COURAGE, AND SENT OUT AN ARMY TO EPIDAMNUS AND APOLLONIA. AT THE\r\nNEWS THAT THE ROMANS HAD RESCUED THE CITIES, THAT THEY HAD DETAINED\r\nSHIPS OF HERS LADEN WITH TREASURE WHICH WERE SAILING HOME FROM THE\r\nPELOPONNESUS, THAT THEY HAD DEVASTATED THE COAST REGIONS, THAT\r\nDEMETRIUS AS A RESULT OF HER CAPRICIOUSNESS HAD TRANSFERRED HIS\r\nALLEGIANCE TO THE ROMANS BESIDES PERSUADING SOME OTHERS TO DESERT, SHE\r\nBECAME UTTERLY TERRIFIED AND WITHDREW FROM HER SOVEREIGNTY. Demetrius\r\nas destined guardian of the child was given charge of the ex-queen\r\nalso. The Romans were thanked by the Corinthians for this action and\r\ntook part in the Isthmian contest, Plautus winning the stadium race in\r\nit. Moreover they formed a friendship with the Athenians and took part\r\nin their government and in the Mysteries.\r\n\r\nThe name Illyricum was anciently applied to various regions, but later\r\nit was transferred to the upper mainland, that above Macedonia and\r\nThrace, located this side of Haemus and toward Rhodope: it lies between\r\nthese mountains and the Alps, also between the river AEnus and the\r\nIster, extending as far as the Euxine Sea,--indeed, its boundaries at\r\nsome points extend beyond the Ister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (FRAG. 48?)] AS AN ORACLE HAD ONCE COME TO THE ROMANS THAT\r\nGREEKS AND GAULS SHOULD OCCUPY THE CITY, TWO GAULS AND A COUPLE OF\r\nGREEKS, MALE AND FEMALE, WERE BURIED ALIVE IN THE FORUM, that in this\r\nway destiny might seem to have fulfilled itself and they be properly\r\nregarded, since buried alive, as possessing a part of the city.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Sardinians, deeming it a calamity that a Roman praetor\r\nwas forever set over them, made an uprising. They were again enslaved,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\nVIII, 20.--The Insubres, a Gallic tribe, having gained allies among\r\ntheir kinsmen beyond the Alps turned their arms against the Romans,\r\nand the latter accordingly made counter-preparations. The barbarians\r\nplundered some towns, but at last a great storm occurred in the night\r\nand they began to suspect that Heaven was against them. Consequently\r\nthey lost heart and falling into a panic attempted to entrust their\r\nsafety to flight. [Sidenote: B.C. 225 (_a.u._ 529)] Regulus pursued\r\nthem and brought on an engagement with the rear guards in which he was\r\ndefeated and lost his life. AEmilius occupied a hill and remained\r\nquiet. The Gauls in turn occupied another one and for several days\r\nwere inactive; then the Romans through anger at what had taken place\r\nand the barbarians from arrogance born of the victory charged down\r\nfrom the heights and came to blows. For a long time the battle was\r\nevenly contested, but finally the Romans surrounded them with their\r\nhorse, cut them down, seized their camp, and got back the spoils.\r\nAfter this AEmilius wrought havoc among the possessions of the Boii and\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 49^3] CELEBRATED A TRIUMPH, IN WHICH HE CONVEYED THE\r\nFOREMOST CAPTIVES CLAD IN ARMOR UP TO THE CAPITOL, MAKING JESTS AT\r\nTHEIR EXPENSE FOR HAVING SWORN NOT TO REMOVE THEIR BREASTPLATES BEFORE\r\nTHEY HAD MOUNTED THE CAPITOL. The Romans now secured control of the\r\nentire territory of the Boii and for the first time crossed the Po to\r\ntake the offensive against the Insubres; and they continued to ravage\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile portents had occurred which threw the people of Rome into\r\ngreat fear. A river in Picenum ran the color of blood, in Etruria a\r\ngood part of the heavens seemed to be on fire, at Ariminum a light\r\nlike daylight blazed out at night, in many portions of Italy the\r\nshapes of three moons became visible in the night time, and in the\r\nForum a vulture roosted for several days. [Sidenote: B.C. 223 (_a.u._\r\n531)] Because of these portents and inasmuch as some declared that the\r\nconsuls had been illegally chosen, they summoned them home. The\r\nconsuls received the letter but did not open it immediately, since\r\nthey were just entering upon war: instead, they joined battle first\r\nand came out victorious. After the battle the letter was read, and\r\nFurius was for obeying without discussion; but Flaminius was elated\r\nover the victory and pointed out that it had proved their choice to be\r\ncorrect, and he went on with vehement assertions that it was because\r\nthey were jealous of him that the influential men were even\r\nfalsifying heavenly warnings. Consequently he refused to depart until\r\nhe had settled the whole business in hand, and he said he would teach\r\nthe people at home, too, not to be deceived by relying on birds or any\r\nother such thing. So he was anxious to remain on the ground and made\r\nrepeated attempts to detain his colleague, but Furius would not heed\r\nhim. But since the men who were going to be left behind with Flaminius\r\ndreaded lest in their isolation they might suffer some disaster at the\r\nhands of their opponents and begged him to stay by them for a few\r\ndays, he yielded to their entreaties but did not take part in any\r\naction. Flaminius traveled about laying waste the country, subjugated\r\na few forts, and bestowed all the spoils upon the soldiers as a means\r\nof winning their favor. At length the leaders returned home and were\r\nput on trial by the senate for their disobedience (on account of their\r\nanger towards Flaminius they subjected Furius also to disgrace); but\r\nthe populace was against the senate and showed emulation in\r\nFlaminius's behalf, so that it voted them a triumph. After celebrating\r\nit they laid down their office.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 222 (_a.u._ 532)] Other consuls, Claudius Marcellus\r\nand Gnaeus Scipio, chosen in their stead, made an expedition against\r\nthe Insubres, for the Romans had not complied with the latter's\r\nrequests by voting for peace. Together at first they carried on the\r\nwar and were in most cases victorious. Soon, learning that the allied\r\nterritory was being plundered, they severed their forces. Marcellus\r\nmade a quick march against those plundering the land of the allies,\r\nbut did not find them on the scene; he then pursued them as they fled\r\nand when they made a stand overcame them. Scipio remained where he was\r\nand proceeded to besiege Acerrae; he took it and made it a base for the\r\nwar, since it was favorably located and well walled. Starting from\r\nthat point they subdued Mediolanum and another village-town. After\r\nthese had been captured the rest of the Insubres also made terms with\r\nthem, giving them money and a section of the land.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 221 (_a.u._ 533)] Thereafter Publius Cornelius and\r\nMarcus Minucius made a campaign to the Ister regions and brought into\r\nsubjection many of the nations there, some by war and some on terms\r\nagreed upon. [Sidenote: B.C. 220 (_a.u._ 534)] Lucius Veturius and\r\nGaius Lutatius went as far as the Alps and without any fighting\r\nestablished Roman sovereignty over many people. The prince of the\r\nArdiaeans, however, [Sidenote: FRAG. 51] DEMETRIUS, WAS, AS HAS BEEN\r\nSTATED ABOVE, HATEFUL TO THE NATIVES AND INJURED THE PROPERTY OF\r\nNEIGHBORING TRIBES; AND IT APPEARED THAT IT WAS BY MISUSING THE\r\nFRIENDSHIP OF THE ROMANS THAT HE WAS ABLE TO WRONG THOSE PEOPLES.\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 219 (_a.u._ 535)] AS SOON AS THE CONSULS, AEMILIUS\r\nPAULUS AND MARCUS LIVIUS, HEARD OF THIS THEY SUMMONED HIM BEFORE THEM.\r\nWHEN HE REFUSED COMPLIANCE AND ACTUALLY ASSAILED THEIR ALLIES, THEY\r\nMADE A CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISSA, WHERE HE WAS. And having received\r\nadvance information that he was lying secretly at anchor somewhere in\r\nthe vicinity of the landing-places they sent a portion of their ships\r\nto the other side of the island to bring on an engagement. When the\r\nIllyrians accordingly fell upon the reconnoitering party, thinking\r\nthem alone, the main body approached at leisure in their ships and\r\nafter pitching camp in a suitable place repulsed the natives, who,\r\nangry at the trick, lost no time in attacking them. Demetrius made his\r\nescape to Pharos, another island, but they sailed to that, overcame\r\nresistance, and captured the city by betrayal, only to find Demetrius\r\nfled. He at this time reached Macedonia with large amounts of money\r\nand went to Philip, the king of the country. He was not surrendered by\r\nhim, but on returning to the Illyrians was arrested by the Romans and\r\nwas executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 13, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 218 (_a.u._ 536)] VIII, 21.--In the succeeding year\r\nthe Romans became openly hostile to the Carthaginians, and the war,\r\nthough of far shorter duration than the previous one, proved to be\r\nboth greater and more baneful in its exploits and effects. It was\r\nbrought on chiefly by Hannibal, general of the Carthaginians. This\r\nHannibal was a child of Hamilcar Barca, and from his earliest boyhood\r\nhad been trained to fight against the Romans. Hamilcar said he was\r\nraising all his sons like so many whelps to fight against them, but as\r\nhe saw that this one's nature was far superior to that of the rest, he\r\nmade him take an oath that he would wage war upon them, and for this\r\nreason he instructed the boy in warfare above all else when only\r\nfifteen years old. On account of this youthfulness Hannibal was not\r\nable, when his father died, to succeed to the generalship. But when\r\nHasdrubal was dead, he delayed no longer, being now twenty-six years\r\nof age, but at once took possession of the army in Spain and after\r\nbeing acclaimed as leader by the soldiers brought it about that his\r\nright to lead was confirmed also by those in authority at home. After\r\neffecting this he needed a plausible excuse for his enterprise against\r\nthe Romans, and this he found in the Saguntines of Spain. These\r\npeople, dwelling not far from the river Iber and a short distance\r\nabove the sea, were dependents of the Romans, and the latter held them\r\nin honor and in the treaty with the Carthaginians had made an\r\nexception of them. For these reasons, then, Hannibal began a war with\r\nthem, knowing that the Romans would either assist the Saguntines or\r\navenge them if they suffered injury. Hence for these reasons as well\r\nas because he knew that they possessed great wealth, which he\r\nparticularly needed, and for various other causes that promised him\r\nadvantages against the Romans he made an attack upon the Saguntines.\r\n\r\nSpain, in which the Saguntines dwell, and all the adjoining land is in\r\nthe western part of Europe. It extends for a considerable distance\r\nalong the inner sea, beside the Pillars of Hercules, and along the\r\nocean; furthermore it occupies the upper part of the mainland for a\r\nvery great distance, as far as the Pyrenees. [Sidenote: FRAG. 53] THIS\r\nRANGE, BEGINNING AT THE SEA CALLED ANCIENTLY THE SEA OF THE BEBRYCES\r\nBUT LATER THE SEA OF THE NARBONENSES, REACHES TO THE GREAT OUTER SEA,\r\nAND CONFINES MANY DIVERSE NATIONALITIES; IT ALSO SEPARATES SPAIN FROM\r\nTHE NEIGHBORING LAND OF GAUL. The tribes did not employ the same\r\nlanguage nor carry on a common government. This resulted in their not\r\nhaving a single name. The Romans called them Hispanii, but the Greeks\r\nIberians, from the river Iber.\r\n\r\nThese Saguntines, then, being besieged sent to those near them and to\r\nthe Romans asking for aid. But Hannibal checked any local movement,\r\nand the Romans sent ambassadors to him bidding him not come near the\r\nSaguntines, and threatening in case he should not obey to sail to\r\nCarthage at once and lay accusations against him. When the envoys\r\nwere now close at hand, Hannibal sent some of the natives who were to\r\npretend that they were kindly disposed to them and were instructed to\r\nsay that the general was not there but had gone some distance away\r\ninto parts unknown; they advised the enemy, therefore (they were to\r\nsay), to depart as quickly as possible and before their presence\r\nshould be reported lest in the disorder prevailing because of the\r\nabsence of the general they should lose their lives. The envoys\r\naccordingly believed them and set off for Carthage. An assembly being\r\ncalled some of the Carthaginians counseled maintaining peace with the\r\nRomans, but the party attached to Hannibal affirmed that the\r\nSaguntines were guilty of wrongdoing and the Romans were meddling with\r\nwhat did not concern them. Finally those who urged them to make war\r\nwon the day.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hannibal in the course of his siege was conducting vigorous\r\nassaults. Many kept falling and many more were being wounded on\r\nHannibal's side. One day the Carthaginians succeeded in shaking down a\r\nportion of the outer circuit and had been daring enough to enter\r\nthrough the breach, when the Saguntines made a sortie and scared them\r\naway. This gave the besieged strength and the Carthaginians fell back\r\nin dejection. They did not leave the spot, however, till they had\r\ncaptured the city, though the siege dragged on to the eighth month.\r\nMany unusual events happened in that time, one of which was Hannibal's\r\nbeing dangerously wounded. The place was taken in this manner. They\r\nbrought to bear against the wall an engine much higher than the\r\nfortification and carrying heavy-armed soldiers, some visible, some\r\nconcealed. While the Saguntines, therefore, were quite strenuously\r\nfighting against the men they saw, thinking them the only ones, those\r\nhidden had dug through the wall from below and found their way inside.\r\nThe Saguntines overwhelmed by the unexpectedness of the event ran up\r\nto the citadel and held a conference to see whether by any reasonable\r\nconcessions they might be preserved. But as Hannibal held out no\r\nmoderate terms and no assistance came to them from the Romans, they\r\nbegged for a cessation of the assaults until they should deliberate a\r\nlittle about their position. During this respite they gathered\r\ntogether the most highly prized of their treasures and cast them into\r\nthe fire; then such as were incapable of fighting committed suicide,\r\nand those who were in their prime advanced in a body against their\r\nopponents and in a desperate struggle were cut down.\r\n\r\nVIII, 22.--For their sakes the Romans and the Carthaginians embarked\r\nupon war. Hannibal after gaining numerous allies was hastening toward\r\nItaly. The Romans on ascertaining this assembled in their senate-hall,\r\nand many speeches were delivered. Lucius Cornelius Lentulus addressed\r\nthe people and said they must not delay but vote for war against the\r\nCarthaginians and separate consuls and armies into two detachments,\r\nand send the one to Spain and the other to Libya, in order that at one\r\nand the same time the land of the enemy might be desolated and his\r\nallies injured; thus neither would he be able to assist Spain nor\r\ncould he himself receive assistance from there. To this Quintus Fabius\r\nMaximus rejoined that it was not so absolutely and inevitably\r\nnecessary to vote for war, but they could first employ an embassy, and\r\nthen if the Carthaginians persuaded them that they were guilty of no\r\nwrong, they should remain quiet, but if the same people were convicted\r\nof wrongdoing, they might thereupon wage war against them, \"in order,\"\r\nhe said, \"that we may cast the responsibility for the war upon them.\"\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 54^9] THE OPINIONS OF THE TWO MEN WERE SUBSTANTIALLY\r\nTHESE. THE SENATE DECIDED TO MAKE PREPARATIONS, TO BE SURE, FOR\r\nCONFLICT, BUT TO DESPATCH ENVOYS TO CARTHAGE AND DENOUNCE HANNIBAL;\r\nAND IF THE CARTHAGINIANS REFRAINED FROM APPROVING THE EXPLOITS, THEY\r\nWOULD ARBITRATE THE MATTER, OR IF ALL RESPONSIBILITY WERE LAID UPON\r\nHIS SHOULDERS, THEY WOULD DEMAND HIS EXTRADITION, AND IF HE WERE NOT\r\nGIVEN UP, THEY WOULD DECLARE WAR UPON THE NATION.\r\n\r\nThe envoys set out and the Carthaginians considered what must be done.\r\nAnd a certain Hasdrubal, one of those who had been primed by Hannibal,\r\ncounseled them that they ought to get back their ancient freedom and\r\nshake off by means of money and troops and allies, all welded\r\ntogether, the slavery imposed by peace, adding: \"If you only permit\r\nHannibal to act as he wishes, the proper thing will be done and you\r\nwill have no trouble.\" After such words on his part the great Hanno,\r\nopposing Hasdrubal's argument, gave it as his opinion that they ought\r\nnot to draw war upon themselves lightly nor for small complaints\r\nconcerning foreigners, when it was in their power to settle a part of\r\nthe difficulty and divert the rest of it upon the heads of those who\r\nhad been active in the matter. With these remarks he ceased, and the\r\nelder Carthaginians who remembered the former war sided with him, but\r\nthose in robust manhood and especially all the partisans of Hannibal\r\nviolently gainsaid him. [Sidenote: FRAG. 54^10] INASMUCH, THEN, AS\r\nTHEY MADE NO DEFINITE ANSWER AND SHOWED CONTEMPT FOR THE ENVOYS,\r\nMARCUS FABIUS THRUSTING HIS HANDS BENEATH HIS TOGA AND HOLDING THEM\r\nWITH PALMS UPWARD SAID: \"HERE I BRING TO YOU, CARTHAGINIANS, BOTH WAR\r\nAND PEACE: DO YOU CHOOSE WHICHEVER OF THEM YOU WISH.\" UPON THEIR\r\nREPLYING THAT THEY CHOSE NEITHER, BUT WOULD READILY ACCEPT EITHER THAT\r\nTHE ROMANS SHOULD LEAVE, HE IMMEDIATELY DECLARED WAR UPON THEM.\r\n\r\nIn this way, then, and for these reasons the Romans and the\r\nCarthaginians became involved in war for the second time. And the\r\nDivinity beforehand indicated what was to come to pass. For in Rome an\r\nox talked with a human voice, and another at the Ludi Romani threw\r\nhimself out of a house into the Tiber and was lost, many thunderbolts\r\nfell, and blood in one case was seen coming from sacred statues\r\nwhereas in another it dripped from the shield of a soldier, and the\r\nsword of another soldier was snatched by a wolf from the very midst of\r\nthe camp. Many unknown wild beasts went before Hannibal leading the\r\nway, as he was crossing the Iber, and a vision appeared to him in a\r\ndream. He thought that the gods once, sitting in assembly, sent for\r\nhim and bade him march with all speed into Italy and receive from them\r\na guide for the way, and that by this guide he was commanded to follow\r\nwithout turning around. He did turn around, however, and saw a great\r\ntempest moving and an immense serpent accompanying it. In surprise he\r\nasked his conductor what these creatures were; and the guide said:\r\n\"Hannibal, they are on their way to help you in the sack of Italy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 14, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\nVIII, 23.--These things inspired Hannibal with a firm hope, but threw\r\nthe Romans into a state of profound terror. The Romans divided their\r\nforces into two parts and sent out the consuls,--Sempronius Longus to\r\nSicily and Publius Scipio to Spain. Hannibal, desiring to invade Italy\r\nwith all possible speed, marched on hurriedly and traversed without\r\nfighting the whole of Gaul lying between the Pyrenees and the Rhone.\r\nAs far as the Rhone river no one came to oppose him, but at that point\r\nScipio showed himself although he had no troops with him. Nevertheless\r\nwith the help of the natives and their nearest neighbors he had\r\nalready destroyed the boats in the river and had posted guards over\r\nthe stream. Hannibal therefore used up some time in building rafts and\r\nskiffs, some of them out of a single log of wood, but still with the\r\nhelp of a large corps of workers had everything in readiness that was\r\nneedful for crossing before Scipio's own army could arrive. He sent\r\nhis brother Mago accompanied by the horsemen and a few light troops to\r\ncross at a point where the river is scattered over considerable\r\nbreadth, with branches separated by islands; he himself, of course,\r\nproceeded by way of the natural ford, his object being that the Gauls\r\nshould be deceived and array themselves against him only, while they\r\nset their guards with less care at other points along the river. This\r\nobject was accomplished. Mago had already got across the river when\r\nHannibal and his followers were crossing by the ford. On reaching the\r\nmiddle of the stream they raised a war cry and the trumpeters joined\r\nwith the blare of their instruments, and Mago fell upon their\r\nantagonists from the rear. In this way the elephants and all the rest\r\nwere ferried safely over. They had just finished crossing when\r\nScipio's own force arrived. Both sides, then, sent horsemen to\r\nreconnoitre, after which they entered upon a cavalry battle with the\r\nsame results as attended the war as a whole. The Romans, that is,\r\nafter first seeming to get the worst of it and losing a number of men\r\nwere victorious.\r\n\r\nThen Hannibal, in haste to set out for Italy but suspicious of the\r\nmore direct roads, turned aside from them and followed another, on\r\nwhich he underwent bitter hardships. The mountains there are\r\nexceedingly precipitous and the snow falling in great quantities was\r\ndriven by the winds and filled the chasms, and the ice was frozen to a\r\ngreat thickness. These things conspired to cause them fearful\r\nsuffering, and many of his soldiers perished through the winter cold\r\nand lack of food; many also returned home. There is a story to the\r\neffect that he himself would also have turned back but for the fact\r\nthat the road already traversed was longer and more difficult than the\r\nportion left before him. For this reason he did not retrace his steps,\r\nbut suddenly appearing south of the Alps spread astonishment and\r\nterror among the Romans.\r\n\r\nSo he advanced taking possession of whatever lay before him. Scipio\r\nsent his brother Gaius[29] Scipio, who was serving as a lieutenant\r\nunder him, into Spain to either seize and hold it or bring Hannibal\r\nback, but he himself marched against Hannibal. They waited a few days;\r\nthen both moved into action. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^4] BEFORE BEGINNING\r\nOPERATIONS, HANNIBAL CALLED TOGETHER THE SOLDIERS AND BROUGHT IN THE\r\nCAPTIVES WHOM HE HAD TAKEN BY THE WAY: HE ASKED THE LATTER WHETHER\r\nTHEY CHOSE TO UNDERGO IMPRISONMENT AND TO ENDURE A GRIEVOUS SLAVERY,\r\nOR TO FIGHT IN SINGLE COMBAT WITH ONE ANOTHER ON CONDITION THAT THE\r\nVICTORS SHOULD BE RELEASED WITHOUT RANSOM. WHEN THEY ACCEPTED THE\r\nSECOND ALTERNATIVE, HE SET THEM TO FIGHTING. AND AT THE END OF THE\r\nCONFLICT HE ADDRESSED his own soldiers, encouraging them and whetting\r\ntheir eagerness for war. Scipio also did this on the Roman side. Then\r\nthe contest began and looked at the outset as if it would involve the\r\nentire armies: but Scipio in a preliminary cavalry skirmish was\r\ndefeated, lost many men, was wounded and would have been killed, had\r\nnot his son Scipio, though only seventeen years old, come to his aid;\r\nhe was consequently alarmed lest his infantry should similarly meet\r\nwith a reverse, and he at once fell back and that night withdrew from\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Gnaeus Scipio is meant whenever Zonaras writes this\r\nform.]\r\n\r\nVIII, 24.--Hannibal did not learn of his withdrawal till daybreak and\r\nthen went to the Po, and finding there neither rafts nor boats,--for\r\nthey had been burned by Scipio,--he ordered his brother Mago to swim\r\nacross with the cavalry and pursue the Romans, whereas he himself\r\nmarched up toward the sources of the river and commanded that the\r\nelephants cross where the tributary streams converged. In this manner,\r\nwhile the water was temporarily dammed and torn piecemeal by the\r\nanimals' bulk, he effected a crossing more easily below them. Scipio\r\novertaken stood his ground and would have offered battle but for the\r\nfact that by night the Gauls in his army deserted. Embarrassed by this\r\noccurrence and still suffering from his wound he once more broke up at\r\nnight and located his entrenchments on high ground. He was not\r\npursued, but subsequently the Carthaginians came up and encamped, with\r\nthe river between the two forces.\r\n\r\nScipio on account of his wound and because of what had taken place was\r\ninclined to wait and send for reinforcements; and Hannibal after many\r\nattempts to provoke him to battle, finding that he could not do this\r\nand that he was short of food, attacked a fort where a large supply\r\nfor the Romans was stored. As he made no headway he employed money to\r\nbribe the commander of the garrison, which thus came into his\r\npossession by betrayal. He hoped also to attain his other objects,\r\npartly by arms and partly by gold. Meanwhile Longus had entrusted\r\nSicily to his lieutenant and had come in response to Scipio's call.\r\nNot much later influenced by ambition on the one hand and also by the\r\nfact of a victory over some marauders he presented himself in battle\r\narray. He lost the day by falling into an ambuscade, and when Hannibal\r\nappeared upon the scene with his infantry and elephants the followers\r\nof the Roman leader turned to flight and many were put to the sword,\r\nmany also heedless of the river fell in and were choked. Only a few\r\nsaved themselves with Longus. However, Hannibal though victorious was\r\nnot happy, because he had lost many soldiers and all of his elephants,\r\nexcept one, as a result of the winter and from wounds.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they arranged an armistice without any desire for peace\r\nimplied and both sides retired to the territory of their allies and\r\npassed the winter in the cities there. Plenty of provisions kept\r\ncoming to the Romans, but Hannibal, not satisfied with the\r\ncontributions of the allies, made frequent raids upon the Roman\r\nvillages and cities and sometimes would conquer, sometimes be\r\nrepulsed. Once he was beaten by Longus with the cavalry and received a\r\nwound. Some of the Roman settlers encouraged by this came out by\r\nthemselves to oppose him when he assailed them. These would-be\r\nwarriors he destroyed and received the capitulation of the place,\r\nwhich he razed to the ground. Of the captives taken he killed the\r\nRomans but released the rest. This he did also in the case of all\r\nthose taken alive, hoping to conciliate the cities by their influence.\r\nAnd, indeed, many of the Gauls as well as Ligurians and Etruscans\r\neither murdered the Romans dwelling within their borders or\r\nsurrendered them and then transferred their allegiance.\r\n\r\nAs Hannibal was advancing toward Etruria Longus attacked him in the\r\nmidst of a great storm. Many fell on both sides and Hannibal entered\r\nLigurian territory and delayed some time. He was suspicious of even\r\nhis own men and was free to trust no one, but made frequent changes of\r\ncostume, wore false hair, spoke different languages at different times\r\n(for he knew a number, including Latin) and both night and day he\r\nwould frequently make the rounds of his camp. He was always listening\r\nto some conversations in the guise of an entirely different person\r\nfrom Hannibal and occasionally he talked thus in character.\r\n\r\nVIII, 25.--While this was going on in Italy the other Scipio, Gaius,\r\nhad sailed along the coast to Spain, and had won over, partly by force\r\nand partly without opposition, all the districts to the Iber that\r\nborder on the sea and considerable of the upper peninsula. He had also\r\ndefeated Banno in battle and had taken him prisoner. Hasdrubal, the\r\nbrother of Hannibal, on learning this crossed the Iber and reduced\r\nsome of the rebels, but at Scipio's approach he fell back.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 217 (_a.u._ 537)] The people of Rome again chose\r\nFlaminius and Geminus consuls. Just after the advent of spring\r\nHannibal was apprised that Flaminius together with Servilius Geminus\r\nwould march against him with a large force, and he devoted his\r\nattention to deceiving them. He pretended that he was going to spend\r\nhis time and meet the issue where he was, and when the Romans,\r\nthinking that he was permanently located, began to show carelessness\r\nin their line of march, he started just after nightfall, leaving his\r\ncavalry behind at camp, noiselessly traversed the passes and hastened\r\non toward Aretium; and the cavalry, after he had got far ahead, set\r\nout to follow him. When the consuls found out that they had been\r\ntricked, Geminus stayed behind to harass the revolted districts and\r\nprevent them from assisting the Carthaginians, and Flaminius alone\r\npursued, eager that his alone should be the credit of the expected\r\nvictory. He succeeded in occupying Aretium beforehand, for Hannibal in\r\ntaking a shorter road had encountered difficult marching, and had\r\nlost numerous men, many pack animals, and one of his eyes. It was\r\nlate, then, before he reached Aretium and found there Flaminius, whom\r\nhe regarded with contempt. He did not give battle, for the situation\r\nwas unsuitable, but by way of testing his enemy's disposition he laid\r\nwaste the country. At this the Romans made a sally and he retired, to\r\ngive them the idea that he was afraid. During the night he broke up\r\nand found a satisfactory spot for battle, where he remained. He\r\narranged that most of the infantry should form an ambush along the\r\nmountain sides and ordered all the cavalry to lie in wait concealed\r\nfrom view outside the pass; he himself encamped with a few followers\r\non the hilltop. Flaminius was in good spirits and when he saw him with\r\nbut a few men on the high ground he believed that the rest of the army\r\nmust have been sent to some distant point and hoped to take him easily\r\nthus isolated. So he carelessly entered the mouth of the pass and\r\nthere (for it was late) pitched camp. About midnight, when they were\r\nsleeping unguarded through scorn of their enemies, the Carthaginians\r\nsurrounded them on every side at once and by using from a distance\r\njavelins, slings, and arrows they killed some still in their beds,\r\nothers just seizing their arms, without receiving any serious harm in\r\nreturn. The Romans, having no tangible adversaries and with darkness\r\nand mist prevailing, found no chance to employ their valor. So great\r\nwas the uproar and of such a nature the disordered alarm that seized\r\nthem, that they were not even aware of earthquakes then prevailing,\r\nalthough many buildings fell in ruins and many mountains either were\r\ncleft asunder or collapsed so that they blocked up ravines, and rivers\r\nshut off from their ancient outlet sought another. Such were the\r\nearthquakes which overwhelmed Etruria, yet the combatants were not\r\nconscious of them. Flaminius himself and a vast number of others fell,\r\nthough not a few managed to climb a hill. When it became day, they\r\nstarted to flee and being overtaken surrendered themselves and their\r\narms on promise of free pardon. Hannibal, however, recking little of\r\nhis oaths, imprisoned and kept under guard the Romans themselves, but\r\nreleased their subjects and allies among all the captives he had in\r\nhis army. After this success he hastened toward Rome and proceeded as\r\nfar as Narnia devastating the country and winning over the cities,\r\nsave Spoletium; there he surrounded and slew the praetor Gaius\r\nCentenius who was in ambush. He made an attack upon Spoletium, but was\r\nrepulsed, and as he saw that the bridge over the Nar had been torn\r\ndown and ascertained that this had been done also in the case of the\r\nother rivers which he was obliged to cross, he ceased his headlong\r\nrush upon Rome. Instead, he turned aside into Campania, for he heard\r\nthat the land was excellent and that Capua was a great city, and\r\nthought that if he should first occupy these he might acquire the rest\r\nof Italy in a short time.\r\n\r\nThe people of Rome when informed of the defeat were grieved and\r\nlamented both for themselves and for the lost. They were in sore\r\nstraits and tore down the bridges over the Tiber, save one, and\r\nproceeded hurriedly to repair their walls, which were weak in many\r\nplaces. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^9] WISHING TO HAVE A DICTATOR READY, THEY\r\nHAD PROCLAIMED ONE IN ASSEMBLY. SATISFIED IF THEY THEMSELVES ONLY\r\nSHOULD BE SAVED, THEY HAD DESPATCHED NO AID TO THE ALLIES. BUT NOW,\r\nLEARNING THAT HANNIBAL HAD SET OUT INTO CAMPANIA, THEY DETERMINED TO\r\nASSIST THE ALLIES ALSO. To Hannibal they opposed the dictator Fabius\r\nand the master of horse Marcus Minucius. These leaders set out in his\r\ndirection but did not come into close quarters with him. They followed\r\nand kept him in view in the hope that a favorable opportunity for\r\nbattle might possibly befall. Fabius was unwilling to risk a conflict\r\nwith cowed and beaten soldiers against a greater number who had been\r\nvictorious. Furthermore he hoped that the more his foes should injure\r\nthe country, the sooner would they be in want of food. Calculating in\r\nthis way he did not defend Campania nor any other district. For these\r\nreasons he confined hostilities entirely within Campania; unknown to\r\nthe enemy he had surrounded them on every side and now kept guard over\r\nthem. He himself secured an abundance of provisions both from the sea\r\nand from the territory of allies, but the invaders, he knew, had only\r\nthe products of the land which they were devastating to depend upon.\r\nTherefore he waited and did not mind the delay. Hence also he was\r\nblamed by his fellow-citizens and was even given the name of The\r\nDelayer.\r\n\r\nVIII, 26.--When it came to be nearly winter and Hannibal could not\r\npass that season where he was owing to a lack of the necessities of\r\nlife and had been checked in many attempts to get out of Campania, he\r\ndevised a plan of this kind. He first slew all the captives, that no\r\none of them might escape and acquaint the Romans with what was being\r\ndone. Then he gathered the cattle which were in camp, affixed torches\r\nto their horns, and went at nightfall to the mountains forming the\r\nboundary of Samnium, where he lighted the torches and threw the cattle\r\ninto a fright. They, maddened by the fire and the driving, set fire to\r\nthe forest in many places and consequently rendered it easy for\r\nHannibal to cross the mountains. The Romans in the plain as well as\r\nthose on the heights dreaded an ambuscade and would not budge. Thus\r\nHannibal got across and made his way into Samnium.\r\n\r\nFabius, ascertaining the next day what had been done, gave chase and\r\nrouted those left behind on the road to hinder his men's progress,\r\nafterward defeating also troops that came to the assistance of the\r\nfirst party. He then encamped not far from the enemy, yet would not\r\ncome into conflict with them. However, he prevented them from\r\nscattering and foraging, so that Hannibal in perplexity at first\r\nstarted for Rome. As Fabius would not fight, but quietly accompanied\r\nhim, he again turned back into Samnium. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^10] AND\r\nFABIUS FOLLOWING ON CONTINUED TO BESIEGE HIM FROM A SAFE DISTANCE,\r\nBEING ANXIOUS NOT TO LOSE ANY OF HIS OWN TROOPS, especially since he\r\ncould obtain necessities in abundance, whereas he saw that his foe\r\nactually possessed nothing outside of his weapons and that no\r\nassistance was sent to him from home. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^11] FOR THE\r\nCARTHAGINIANS WERE DISPOSED TO MAKE SPORT OF HIM IN THAT HE WROTE OF\r\nHIS SPLENDID PROGRESS AND HIS MANY SUCCESSES AND IN THE SAME BREATH\r\nASKED SOLDIERS OF THEM AND MONEY. THEY SAID THAT HIS REQUESTS WERE NOT\r\nIN ACCORD WITH HIS SUCCESSES: CONQUERORS OUGHT TO FIND THEIR ARMY\r\nSUFFICIENT, AND TO FORWARD MONEY TO THEIR HOMES INSTEAD OF DEMANDING\r\nMORE.\r\n\r\nAs long as Fabius was in the field, no disaster happened to the\r\nRomans, but when he started for Rome on some public business, they met\r\nwith a setback. Rufus, his master of horse, was only a young man and\r\ntherefore full of empty conceit; he was not observant of the errors of\r\nwarfare and was wearied by the delays of Fabius: hence, when he once\r\nheld the leadership of the army alone, he disregarded the injunctions\r\nof the dictator and hastened to bring on a set battle, in which at\r\nfirst he seemed to be victorious, but was soon defeated. Indeed, he\r\nwould have been utterly destroyed, had not some Samnites arrived by\r\nchance to aid the Romans and impressed the Carthaginians with the idea\r\nthat Fabius was approaching. When for this reason they retired he\r\nthought that he had vanquished them and sent messages to Rome\r\nmagnifying his exploit and also slandering the dictator; he called\r\nFabius timorous and hesitating and a sympathizer with the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe people of Rome believed that Rufus had really conquered, and in\r\nview of this unexpected encouragement they commended and honored him.\r\nThey were suspicious of Fabius both because of the outcome and because\r\nhe had not ravaged his own land in Campania, and it would have taken\r\nbut little to make them depose him from his command. However, as they\r\nbelieved him useful, [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^14] THEY DID NOT DEPOSE HIM\r\nBUT THEY ASSIGNED EQUAL POWER TO HIS MASTER OF HORSE SO THAT BOTH HELD\r\nCOMMAND ON AN EQUAL FOOTING. WHEN THIS HAD BEEN DECREED, FABIUS\r\nHARBORED NO WRATH AGAINST EITHER THE CITIZENS OR RUFUS; BUT RUFUS, WHO\r\nHAD NOT SHOWN THE RIGHT SPIRIT IN THE FIRST PLACE, WAS NOW ESPECIALLY\r\nPUFFED UP AND COULD NOT CONTAIN HIMSELF. HE KEPT ASKING FOR THE RIGHT\r\nTO HOLD SOLE SWAY A DAY AT A TIME, OR FOR SEVERAL DAYS ALTERNATELY.\r\nFABIUS, POSSESSED WITH DREAD THAT HE MIGHT WORK SOME HARM IF HE SHOULD\r\nGET POSSESSION OF THE UNDIVIDED POWER, WOULD NOT CONSENT TO EITHER\r\nPLAN OF HIS, BUT DIVIDED THE ARMY IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY EACH, THE\r\nSAME AS THE CONSULS, HAD A SEPARATE FORCE. AND IMMEDIATELY RUFUS\r\nENCAMPED APART, IN ORDER TO ILLUSTRATE THE FACT THAT HE WAS HOLDING\r\nSWAY IN HIS OWN RIGHT AND NOT SUBJECT TO THE DICTATOR. Hannibal,\r\naccordingly, perceiving this came up as if to seize a position, and\r\ndrew him into battle. He then encompassed him about by means of an\r\nambuscade and plunged him into danger, to such an extent, indeed, that\r\nhe would have annihilated his entire army, if Fabius had not assailed\r\nHannibal in the rear and prevented it.\r\n\r\nAfter this experience [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^16] RUFUS ALTERED HIS\r\nATTITUDE, LED THE REMNANT OF THE ARMY IMMEDIATELY INTO FABIUS'S\r\nQUARTERS AND LAID DOWN HIS COMMAND. HE DID NOT WAIT FOR THE PEOPLE TO\r\nREVOKE IT, BUT VOLUNTARILY GAVE UP THE LEADERSHIP WHICH HE, A MERE\r\nMASTER OF THE HORSE, HAD OBTAINED FROM HIS SUPERIOR. AND FOR THIS ALL\r\nPRAISED HIM. AND FABIUS AT ONCE, NOTHING DOUBTING, ACCEPTED ENTIRE\r\nCONTROL AND THE PEOPLE SANCTIONED IT. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^17]\r\nTHEREAFTER AS HEAD OF THE ARMY HE AFFORDED GREATEST SECURITY, AND WHEN\r\nABOUT TO RETIRE FROM OFFICE SENT FOR THE CONSULS, SURRENDERED THE ARMY\r\nTO THEM, AND ADVISED THEM VERY FULLY REGARDING ALL THE DETAILS OF WHAT\r\nMUST BE DONE. AND THEY WERE NOT UNDULY BOLD, BUT ACTED ENTIRELY ON THE\r\nSUGGESTION OF FABIUS, notwithstanding that Geminus had had some\r\nprevious success. He had seen the Carthaginian fleet at anchor off\r\nItaly but not venturing to display any hostility because of the Roman\r\nability to meet it, and he had started on a retaliatory voyage, first\r\nmaking sure the good conduct of the Corsicans and Sardinians by a\r\ncruise past their coasts; he had then landed in Libya and plundered\r\nthe shore district. In spite of this achievement he was not so puffed\r\nup by it as to risk a decisive engagement with Hannibal, but was\r\nwilling to abide by the injunctions of Fabius. One consequence was\r\nthat the cities were no longer found siding with the Carthaginians, as\r\nthey had done; for they feared that Hannibal would be driven out of\r\nItaly and they themselves suffer some calamity at the hands of the\r\nRomans since they were their kinsmen. The majority were engaged in\r\ntrying to read the future, but a few again espoused the Roman cause,\r\nand some sent them offerings. And though Hiero often sent grain (and\r\nalso sent a statue of Victory), the Romans accepted it only once. Yet\r\nthey were in such hard straits for money that the silver coinage which\r\nwas previously unalloyed and pure was now mixed with copper.\r\n\r\nIX, 1.--All this is what took place in Italy at that period. Some\r\nslaves also formed a conspiracy against Rome, but were apprehended in\r\nadvance. And a spy caught in the city had his hands cut off and was\r\nreleased that he might tell the Carthaginians his experience with his\r\nown lips.--In Spain in a sea-fight near the mouth of the Iber Scipio\r\nwas victorious; for when the struggle proved to be too even, the sails\r\nwere cut down in order that the men being placed in a desperate\r\nposition might struggle more zealously. He also ravaged the country,\r\ngot possession of numerous fortresses and through his brother Publius\r\nScipio gained control of some Spanish cities. A Spaniard named Habelux\r\naffecting loyalty to the Carthaginians but in reality in the Roman\r\nservice persuaded the Carthaginian guardian of the Spanish hostages to\r\nsend them to their homes, in order that they might use their influence\r\nto bring their cities into friendly relations. Habelux naturally took\r\ncharge of them, inasmuch as he had been the one to suggest the idea,\r\nbut first sent to the Scipios and held a discussion about what he\r\ndesired; then, while he was secretly taking the hostages away by\r\nnight, he of course got captured. In this way it was the Romans who\r\nobtained possession of these men and acquired control of their native\r\nstates by returning them to their homes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 15, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 216 (_a.u._ 538)] Though in these matters they were\r\nfortunate, they encountered elsewhere a fearful disaster, than which\r\nthey never suffered one more terrible either earlier or subsequently.\r\nIt was preceded by certain portents and the solemn verses of the Sibyl\r\nwhich had prophesied the disaster to them so many years before.\r\nRemarkable was also the prediction of Marcius. He also was a\r\nsoothsayer and it was his rede that, inasmuch as they were Trojans of\r\nold, they should be overthrown in the Plain of Diomed. This was in\r\nDaunian Apulia and took its name from the settlement of Diomed, which\r\nhe made there in the course of his wanderings. In that plain is also\r\nCannae, where the present misfortune occurred, close to the Ionian Gulf\r\nand near the mouths of the Aufidus. The Sibyl had urged them to beware\r\nof the spot, yet said it would avail them naught, even if they should\r\nkeep it under strictest guard.\r\n\r\nSuch were the oracular utterances: now what befell the Romans was\r\nthis. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^21] THE COMMANDERS WERE AEMILIUS PAULUS AND\r\nTERENTIUS VARRO, MEN NOT OF SIMILAR TEMPERAMENT. FOR THE ONE WAS A\r\nPATRICIAN, POSSESSED OF THE GRACES OF EDUCATION, AND ESTEEMED SAFETY\r\nBEFORE HASTE: BUT TERENTIUS HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP AMONG THE RABBLE, WAS\r\nPRACTICED IN VULGAR BRAVADO, AND SO DISPLAYED LACK OF PRUDENCE IN\r\nNEARLY ALL RESPECTS, THINKING, FOR INSTANCE, THAT HE ALONE SHOULD HAVE\r\nTHE LEADERSHIP IN VIEW OF THE QUIET BEHAVIOR OF HIS COLLEAGUE. NOW\r\nTHEY BOTH REACHED THE CAMP AT A MOST OPPORTUNE TIME: HANNIBAL HAD NO\r\nLONGER ANY PROVENDER; SPAIN WAS IN TURMOIL; THE AFFECTION OF THE\r\nALLIES WAS BEING ALIENATED FROM HIM; AND IF THEY HAD WAITED FOR EVEN\r\nTHE BRIEFEST POSSIBLE PERIOD, THEY WOULD HAVE CONQUERED. AS MATTERS\r\nWENT, HOWEVER, THE RECKLESSNESS OF TERENTIUS AND THE SUBMISSIVENESS OF\r\nPAULUS COMPASSED THEIR DEFEAT. Hannibal attempted to lead them into a\r\nconflict at once, and with a few followers drew near their stronghold:\r\nthen, when a sortie was made, he purposely fell back to create the\r\nimpression of being afraid and so drew them the more surely into a set\r\nbattle. But, as Paulus restrained his own soldiers from pursuit,\r\nHannibal simulated terror and that night packed up as if to depart;\r\nand he left behind him numerous articles lying within the palisade and\r\nordered the rest of the baggage to be escorted with a considerable\r\nshow of carelessness so as to make the Romans devote their attention\r\nto plundering it and give him thereby a chance to attack them. He\r\nwould have translated his wish into fact, if Paulus had not held back\r\nhis soldiers, in spite of their reluctance, and held back Terentius as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nSo Hannibal, having failed in this essay also, came by night to Cannae,\r\nand since he knew the place as one fit for ambuscades and for a\r\npitched battle, he encamped there. And first he ploughed the whole\r\nsite over, because it had a sandy subsoil and his object was to have a\r\ncloud of dust raised in the conflict; the wind generally springs up\r\nthere in summer toward noon, and he contrived to get it behind his\r\nback. The consuls seeing at dawn that his stockade was empty of men at\r\nfirst waited, apprehending ambush, but later in the broad daylight\r\ncame to Cannae. Each of the Roman leaders bivouacked apart beside the\r\nriver, for since they were not congenial they avoided association\r\ntogether. Paulus remained quiet, but Terentius was anxious to force\r\nthe issue; when he saw, however, that the soldiers were rather\r\nlistless, he gave up the idea. But Hannibal, who was determined to\r\ngoad them into battle even against their will, shut them off from\r\ntheir sources of water, prevented their scattering into small parties,\r\nand threw the bodies of the slain into the stream above their\r\nintrenchments and in plain sight, in order to disgust them with the\r\ndrinking supply. Then the Romans started to array themselves for\r\nbattle. Hannibal anticipating this movement had planted ambuscades at\r\nthe foot of the hills but held the remainder of his army drawn up. He\r\nalso ordered some men at a given signal to simulate desertion; they\r\nwere to throw away their shields and spears and larger swords but\r\nsecretly to retain their daggers, so that after his antagonists had\r\nreceived them as unarmed, they might attack them unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nThe Romans having had in view since early morning the troops arrayed\r\nabout Hannibal were now arming themselves and taking their places. The\r\ntrumpets incited both parties, the signals were raised, and then\r\nensued the clash of battle and a contest which assumed a variety of\r\naspects. Until noon the advantage had not fallen distinctly to either\r\nside. Then the wind came up and the false deserters were received as\r\nmen destitute of arms and got behind the Romans, alleging the very\r\nnatural reason that they wanted to be out of the way of the\r\nCarthaginian attack. At this moment the men rose from ambush on both\r\nsides, Hannibal with his cavalry charged the front ranks, the enemy\r\nconfused the Romans on every hand, the wind and the dust cloud\r\nassailed their faces violently, causing perplexity, and interfered\r\nwith their breathing, which was already growing quick and labored from\r\nexertion, so that deprived of sight, deprived of voice, they perished\r\nin a wild melee, preserving no semblance of order. So great a\r\nmultitude fell that Hannibal did not even try to find out the number\r\nof the common people, and in regard to the number of the knights and\r\nmembers of the senate he did not write to the Carthaginians at home\r\nbut indicated it by the finger-rings; these he measured off by the\r\nquart and sent away. Only the senators and the knights wore\r\nfinger-rings. Yet after all a number made good their escape even on\r\nthis occasion, among them Terentius; Paulus was killed. Hannibal did\r\nnot pursue nor did he hasten to Rome. He might have set out at once\r\nfor Rome with either his entire army or at least a portion of it and\r\nhave quickly ended the war; yet he did not do so, although Maharbal\r\nurged him to do so. Hence he was censured as being able to win\r\nvictories but not understanding how to use them. Since they had\r\ndelayed this time, they could never again have an opportunity to make\r\nhaste. Therefore Hannibal regretted it, feeling that he had committed\r\na blunder, and was ever crying out: \"Oh Cannae, Cannae!\"\r\n\r\nIX, 2.--The Romans, who had been in such imminent danger of being\r\ndestroyed, won back their superiority through Scipio. He was a son of\r\nthe Publius Scipio in Spain, and had saved the life of his father when\r\nthe latter was wounded: [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^24] HE WAS AT THIS TIME\r\nSERVING IN THE ARMY, HAD FLED TO CANUSIUM, AND LATER ACHIEVED RENOWN.\r\nBY COMMON CONSENT OF THE FUGITIVES ASSEMBLED AT CANUSIUM HE RECEIVED\r\nTHE LEADERSHIP, SET IN ORDER AFFAIRS AT THAT PLACE, SENT GARRISONS TO\r\nTHE REGIONS IN PROXIMITY, AND BOTH PLANNED AND EXECUTED ALL MEASURES\r\nWELL.\r\n\r\nThe people of Rome heard of the defeat but did not believe it. When\r\nthey at last came to believe it, they were filled with sorrow and met\r\nin the senate-house, but were ready to break up without accomplishing\r\nanything, when finally Fabius proposed that they send scouts to bring\r\na report of what had really happened and what Hannibal was doing. He\r\nadvised them not to lament but to go about in silence that the\r\nnecessary measures might be taken, and furthermore to collect as large\r\na force as they might and to call upon adjoining settlements for aid.\r\nAfter this, upon learning that Hannibal was in Apulia and receiving a\r\nletter from Terentius stating that he was alive and what he was doing,\r\nthey recovered a little of their courage. Marcus Junius was named\r\ndictator and Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus master of the horse.\r\nImmediately they enrolled not only those of the citizens who were in\r\ntheir prime but also those even who were past the fighting age; they\r\nadded to their forces prisoners on promise of pardon and slaves on\r\npromise of freedom and a brigand here and there; moreover they called\r\non their allies to help, reminding them of any kindness ever shown\r\nthem and promising in addition to give to some of them grain, to\r\nothers money, as they had never done before; they also sent emissaries\r\nto Greece to either persuade or hire men to serve as their allies.\r\n\r\nHannibal, learning that the Romans had united their troops and were\r\nengaged in preparations, still delayed at Cannae despairing of a\r\ncapture by assault. Of the captives he released the allied contingent\r\nwithout ransom as before, but the Romans he kept, hoping to dispose of\r\nthem by sale, since this would make him better off but the Romans\r\nworse off. When no one came from Rome in quest of the captives, he\r\nordered them to send some of their number home after ransom, provided\r\nthey had first taken oath to return. When even then the Romans refused\r\nto ransom them, he shipped those who were of any value to Carthage,\r\nand of the rest he put some to death after maltreating them and forced\r\nthe others to fight as gladiators, pitting friends and relatives\r\nagainst each other. Those who were sent for ransom returned in order\r\nto be true to their oaths, but later fled. They were disfranchised by\r\nthe censors and committed suicide.\r\n\r\nHannibal sent his brother Mago to report the victory to the\r\nCarthaginians and to ask them for money and troops. He on his arrival\r\ncounted over the rings and described the success naturally in even\r\nmore glowing terms than it deserved; everything that he asked was\r\nvoted and they would not listen to Hanno who opposed it and advised\r\nthem to end the war while they seemed to have the upper hand. However,\r\nthey never put their vote into effect, but delayed. Hannibal\r\nmeanwhile had advanced into Campania, had seized a Samnite fortress,\r\nand marched upon Neapolis. He sent before him a few soldiers with the\r\nbooty and when the people of the city, thinking them alone, rushed out\r\nupon them, he unexpectedly appeared in person and slew a large number.\r\nHe did not capture the city, nor did he lay siege to it for long. The\r\nreason will presently be plain. Of the Campanian inhabitants of Capua\r\na part clung to Roman friendship, but others favored Hannibal. After\r\nhis success at Cannae and when some of their men taken captive had been\r\nreleased the populace was clamorous to revolt to Hannibal, but the men\r\nof rank waited for some time. Finally the crowd made a rush upon them\r\nas they were assembled in the senate-house and would have made away\r\nwith them all but for the action of some one of the crowd who saw how\r\ngreat a misfortune this would be. This person denounced the senators\r\nas by all means deserving to perish, but said that they ought first to\r\nchoose others to fill their places, for the State could not endure\r\nwithout some men to concert measures for them. Having gained the\r\nassent of the Capuan people he ejected each one of them from the\r\nsenate-house, asking the populace, as he did so, whom they chose in\r\nhis place. Thus, as they found themselves unable to choose others on\r\nshort notice, they let all the old senators go unharmed, because they\r\nappeared to be necessary. Later they became reconciled with one\r\nanother and made peace with Hannibal. This is why he quickly retired\r\nfrom Neapolis and came to Capua. He held a conference with the people\r\nand made many attractive offers, among other things promising to give\r\nthem the supreme direction of Italy; for he was anxious that they\r\nshould be animated by hope and, feeling that they would be working for\r\nthemselves, develop greater zeal in the struggle.\r\n\r\nAt the revolt of Capua the rest of Campania also became restive, and\r\nthe news of the town's secession troubled the Romans. As for Hannibal,\r\nhe started on a campaign against the Nucerini. Under stress of siege\r\nand owing to lack of food they thrust out that portion of the\r\npopulation which was not available for fighting. Hannibal would not\r\nreceive them, however, and gave them assurance of safety only in case\r\nthey should go back to the city. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^25] THEREFORE THE\r\nREST ALSO AGREED TO LEAVE THE CITY CARRYING ONE CHANGE OF CLOTHING. AS\r\nSOON, HOWEVER, AS HANNIBAL WAS MASTER OF THE SITUATION, HE SHUT THE\r\nSENATORS INTO BATH-HOUSES AND SUFFOCATED THEM, AND IN THE CASE OF THE\r\nOTHERS, ALTHOUGH HE HAD TOLD THEM TO GO AWAY WHERE THEY PLEASED, HE\r\nCUT DOWN ON THE ROAD MANY EVEN OF THEM. A NUMBER OF THEM SAVED THEIR\r\nLIVES ONLY BY TAKING REFUGE IN THE WOODS. THEREUPON THE REST BECAME\r\nAFRAID AND WOULD NO LONGER COME TO TERMS WITH HIM, BUT RESISTED WHILE\r\nTHEY WERE ABLE. The people of Nola were planning to range themselves\r\nunder his banner, but when they saw what had been done to their\r\ncountrymen, they quietly let Marcellus in and later repulsed Hannibal\r\nwhen he assaulted their city. Repelled from Nola he captured the\r\npeople of Acerrae by starving them out. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^29] HE\r\nMADE THE SAME TERMS WITH THEM AS WITH THE DWELLERS IN NUCERIA AND ALSO\r\nACCORDED THEM THE SAME TREATMENT. After that he directed his forces\r\nagainst Casilinum in which Romans and about a thousand of the allies\r\nhad taken refuge. These put to death the native citizens who were\r\nmeditating how to betray them, repulsed Hannibal several times and\r\nheld out nobly against hunger. When food was failing them they sent a\r\nman across the river on an inflated skin to inform the dictator. The\r\nlatter put jars filled with wheat into the river at night and bade\r\nthem keep their eyes on the current in the darkness. For a while he\r\nthus supplied them with nutriment without being discovered, but\r\neventually a jar was dashed against some obstacle and shattered; then\r\nthe Carthaginians became aware of what was going on and put chains\r\nacross the river. After a number had perished of hunger and of their\r\nwounds, they abandoned one half of the city, cut down the bridge, and\r\nheld out in the other half. They now threw turnip seed from the wall\r\nupon a spot outside, doing this in order to alarm the enemy and make\r\nthem believe that they were likely to endure for a long time.\r\nHannibal, indeed, thinking that they must have plenty of food and\r\nastonished at their endurance invited them to capitulate and released\r\nthem for money. The Romans outside were glad to ransom them, and more\r\nthan that they showed them honor.\r\n\r\nIX, 3.--While these events took place the messengers returned from\r\nDelphi saying that the Pythia admonished them to shake off sloth and\r\ndevote themselves to the war. Then they were filled with new\r\nstrength. They overtook Hannibal and encamped near him so as to watch\r\nhis movements. Junius the dictator ordered the Romans to do exactly as\r\nthe Carthaginians were commanded to do. So they took their food and\r\nsleep at the same time, visited the sentries in the same manner, and\r\nwere doing everything else in similar fashion. When Hannibal\r\nunderstood the situation, he waited for a stormy night and announced\r\nto some of his soldiers a skirmish for after nightfall. Junius did the\r\nsame thing. Thereupon Hannibal ordered different detachments to attack\r\nhim in succession at different times in order that his opponent might\r\nbe involved in constant labor as a result of sleeplessness and the\r\nstorm. He himself rested with the troops not in action. When day was\r\nabout to break, he recalled the army, as was expected, and the Romans\r\nput away their weapons and retired to rest; then all of a sudden he\r\nattacked them, with the result that he killed a number and captured\r\nthe entrenchments, which were deserted.\r\n\r\nConditions in Sicily and Sardinia grew unsettled but did not receive\r\nany consideration at the hands of the Romans. [Sidenote: B.C. 215\r\n(_a.u._ 539)] The consuls chosen were Gracchus, previously master of\r\nthe horse, and Postumius Albinus. Albinus was ambuscaded and destroyed\r\nwith his entire army by the Boii as he was traversing a wooded\r\nmountain. The barbarians cut off his head, scooped out the interior\r\nand after gilding it used it for a bowl in their sacred\r\nceremonials.--Portents occurred at this time. A cow brought forth a\r\nhorse and fire shone out at sea. The consuls Gracchus and Fabius\r\nencamped and kept watch of Hannibal while he stayed in Capua, to see\r\nwhat he did. They spent their time in sending scouts in every\r\ndirection, defending the allies, trying to win back the revolted and\r\ninjuring their adversaries' interests. Hannibal, so long as he\r\nobtained a barely sufficient supply of food at the cost of\r\nencountering dangers, led a temperate life, as did his army; but after\r\nthey had taken Capua and wintered there in idleness with ample\r\nprovisions, they began to lose their physical strength by not laboring\r\nand their intellectual force by tranquillity, and in changing their\r\nancestral habits they learned an accomplishment new to them,--that of\r\nbeing defeated in battle.--When the work of war finally became\r\npressing, Hannibal transferred his quarters to the mountains and gave\r\nthe army exercise. But they could not get strong in a short space of\r\ntime. He was encouraged by the arrival of reinforcements from home,\r\nespecially in the matter of elephants. He now set out against Nola\r\nintending to capture it or else to draw Marcellus, who was ravaging\r\nSamnium, away from that region. As he could accomplish nothing, he\r\nwithdrew from the city and laid waste the country, until he suffered a\r\ndecisive defeat in battle,--an event which grieved him. Many Spaniards\r\nand even many Libyans now forsook him and deserted to the Romans,--a\r\nnew experience for him. Consequently, despairing of his own and the\r\nsoldiers' prospects he abandoned that entire region and retired to\r\nCapua. Afterward he left there also to take up a different position.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 217 (_a.u._ 537)] The Scipios had crossed the river\r\nIber and were ravaging the country; they had secured control of\r\nvarious cities and when Hasdrubal for this reason hastened to oppose\r\nthem, they had conquered him in battle. The Carthaginians learning\r\nthis thought that Hasdrubal needed more assistance than did Hannibal,\r\nand fearing that the Scipios might attempt to cross into Libya also\r\nthey sent only a small body of troops to Hannibal, but despatched the\r\nlargest detachment with Mago to Spain with the utmost speed; and they\r\nbade him after the reduction of Spain to remain to guard their\r\ninterests there, whereas Hasdrubal was to be sent with a body of\r\ntroops against Italy. [Sidenote: B.C. 216 (_a.u._ 538)] The Scipios,\r\nmade aware of the plan, no longer gave battle for fear that Hasdrubal\r\nperhaps might win a victory and then hasten to Italy. However, as the\r\nCarthaginians went on injuring the part of the country that was\r\nfriendly to the Romans, Publius engaged in a struggle with such of his\r\nopponents as attacked him and won a victory; Gnaeus intercepted the\r\nenemy who were retiring from this battle and annihilated them. As a\r\nresult of this disaster and because numerous cities were transferring\r\ntheir allegiance to the Romans and some of the Libyans had gone over\r\nto their side, Hasdrubal remained there longer than he was intending.\r\nThe Scipios sent their accessions at once to Italy, and they\r\nthemselves continued to adjust affairs in Spain. They captured the\r\nsubjects of Saguntum who had caused them the war and their reverses,\r\nand they tore down the hostile settlement and sold the men. After this\r\nthey took possession of Saguntum and restored it to its original\r\ninhabitants. They were so scrupulous in regard to the plunder that\r\nthey sent nothing home. They allowed the partners of their campaign to\r\ndo so, but for themselves they sent only some jackstones to their\r\nchildren. Hence the senate upon the request of Gnaeus for leave of\r\nabsence that he might go home and borrow a dowry for his daughter, who\r\nwas of age to be married, voted that a dowry be given her from the\r\npublic funds.\r\n\r\nIX, 4.--In the course of the same period both Sicily and Sardinia had\r\nbecome openly hostile. But the disturbance in these regions soon\r\nsubsided. [Sidenote: B.C. 215 (_a.u._ 539)] Hasdrubal, who was aiding\r\nthem, was captured and Manlius Torquatus recovered almost the entire\r\nisland. For the time being affairs in Sicily were quiet, but afterward\r\ndisturbance reigned anew. King Philip of Macedonia showed himself a\r\nmost open partisan of the Carthaginians. In his desire to add Greece\r\nto his possessions he made an agreement with Hannibal that they should\r\nconduct the war in common, and that the Carthaginians should get Italy\r\nbut he should have Greece and Epirus together with the islands. The\r\nagreement was made on this basis, but through the capture of the\r\nherald who had been sent to Hannibal by Philip the Romans learned what\r\nwas taking place and forthwith despatched the praetor Marcus Valerius\r\nLaevinus[30] against him. They intended to make him anxious about\r\ninternal affairs, so that he should stay at home. The plan worked.\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 214 (_a.u._ 540)] Philip had progressed as far as\r\nCorcyca with the intention of sailing to Italy, but on learning that\r\nLaevinus was already at Brundusium he returned home. When Laevinus had\r\nsailed as far as Corcyca, Philip set out against the Roman allies; he\r\nhad captured Oricum and was besieging Apollonia. Laevinus made an\r\nexpedition against him anew, recovered Oricum and rescued Apollonia.\r\nThen Philip after burning the ships which he had used retired\r\nhomewards overland.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Zonaras consistently spells this name _Lavinius_.]\r\n\r\nThe people of Rome chose Fabius and Marcellus consuls. Hannibal was\r\nthen traveling about in what is called Calabria and in adjacent\r\nregions, and they assigned the care of him to Gracchus, who had held\r\noffice before them. The latter routed Hanno (who had come from\r\nBruttium and confronted him near Beneventum), and then going on he\r\nwatched Hannibal closely, kept ravaging the possessions of rebels and\r\nwon some cities safely back. The consuls themselves turned their steps\r\ntoward Campania, for they were anxious to subdue it and so leave no\r\nelement of hostility behind their backs when they should march against\r\nHannibal. They then divided forces. Fabius overran the districts of\r\nCampania and Samnium. Marcellus crossed into Sicily and proceeded to\r\nbesiege Syracuse. The town had submitted to him, but then had revolted\r\nagain through the treachery of some men by the use of a false message.\r\nHe would have subdued it very speedily,--for he assaulted the wall by\r\nboth land and sea at once,--had not Archimedes with his inventions\r\nenabled the citizens to resist an extremely long time. By his devices\r\nhe suspended stones and heavy-armed soldiers in the air whom he would\r\nlet down suddenly and soon draw up again. Even ships that carried\r\ntowers he would dash one upon another; he would pull them up and\r\n[Sidenote: (FRAG. 56^31?)] LIFTING THEM HIGH WOULD LET GO ALL IN A\r\nMASS so that when they fell into the water they were sunk by the\r\nimpact. At last in an incredible manner he destroyed the whole Roman\r\nfleet by conflagration. By tilting a kind of mirror toward the sun he\r\nconcentrated the sun's beams on it; and as the thickness and\r\nsmoothness of the mirror cooeperated to ignite the air from these beams\r\nhe kindled a great flame, all of which he directed upon the ships that\r\nlay at anchor in the path of the fire, and he consumed them all.\r\nMarcellus, therefore, despairing of capturing the city on account of\r\nthe inventiveness of Archimedes thought to take it by famine after a\r\nregular investment. This duty he assigned to Pulcher while he himself\r\nturned his attention to those who had participated in the revolt of\r\nSyracuse. Any who yielded were granted pardon, but those who resisted\r\nhe treated harshly, and he captured a number of the cities by force,\r\nsome also by betrayal. In the meantime Himilco had come from Carthage\r\nwith an army, had occupied Agrigentum and Heraclea and had reached\r\nSyracuse. There he was first defeated, then was in turn victorious,\r\nand finally was beaten by a sudden assault on the part of Marcellus.\r\n\r\nIX, 5.--Thereafter Marcellus was still investing Syracuse. Hannibal\r\nwas passing his time in Calabria. [Sidenote: B.C. 212 (_a.u._ 542)]\r\nThe Romans, moreover, had again experienced many and disagreeable\r\nreverses. The consuls had received a setback near Capua, Gracchus had\r\ndied in Lucania, Tarentum and other cities had revolted, Hannibal,\r\npreviously cowed, remained in Italy and had marched upon Rome, and\r\nboth the Scipios had perished. Elated by these events Hannibal\r\nundertook to render assistance to Capua. He went as far as Beneventum,\r\nthen, ascertaining that Claudius had returned from Samnium into\r\nLucania on account of the death of Gracchus, he became afraid that the\r\nRomans might secure control of parts of it, and he advanced no farther\r\nbut turned to meet Claudius.--Upon the death of the Scipios the whole\r\nof Spain was thrown into disorder. Some towns voluntarily went over to\r\nthe Carthaginians and others under compulsion, even if they did later\r\nswing back to the Roman side.\r\n\r\nMarcellus, finding that he was accomplishing naught by assault on\r\nSyracuse, thought of the following scheme. There was a vulnerable spot\r\nin the Syracusans' wall, which they called Galeagra; it had never\r\nbefore been recognized as such, but the fact was at this time\r\ndiscovered. He waited till the whole town of Syracuse celebrated an\r\nall night festival to Artemis and then bade some soldiers scale the\r\nwall at that point. After that some gates were opened by them and, as\r\nsoon as a few others had gone in, all, both inside and outside, at a\r\ngiven signal raised a shout and struck their spears upon their\r\nshields, and the trumpeters blew a blast, with the result that utter\r\npanic overwhelmed the Syracusans, who were anyway somewhat the worse\r\nfor drink, and the city was captured with the exception of Achradina\r\nand what is called the \"island.\" Marcellus plundered the captured town\r\nand attacked the portions not yet taken, and with time and labor but\r\nafter all successfully he conquered the remainder of Syracuse. The\r\nRomans when they became masters of these districts killed many\r\npersons, among them Archimedes. He was constructing a geometrical\r\nfigure and hearing that the enemy were at hand he said: [Sidenote:\r\n(FRAG. 56^32?)] \"Let them come at my head, but keep their distance\r\nfrom my figure!\" He was little perturbed when a hostile warrior\r\nconfronted him, and by his words, \"Fellow, stand away from my figure,\"\r\nhe irritated the man and was cut down.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 211 (_a.u._ 543)] Marcellus for his capture of\r\nSyracuse and his conciliation of most of the rest of Sicily received\r\nhigh praise and was appointed consul. They had nominated Torquatus,\r\nwho once had put his son to death. He declined, however, saying:\r\n[Sidenote: cp. FRAG. 32^6] \"I could not endure your blunders, nor you\r\nmy punctiliousness,\" whereupon they elected Marcellus and Valerius\r\nLaevinus.\r\n\r\nIX, 6.--After Marcellus left Sicily, Hannibal sent a troop of cavalry\r\nthere and the Carthaginians despatched another. They won several\r\nbattles and acquired some cities. And if the praetor Cornelius\r\nDolabella had not come upon the scene, they would have subjugated all\r\nSicily.\r\n\r\nCapua was at this time taken by the Romans. It availed nothing that\r\nHannibal marched upon Rome in order to draw away from Capua the forces\r\nbesieging it, although he traversed Latium, came to the Tiber, and\r\nlaid waste the suburbs of the city. The people of Rome were\r\nfrightened, but still they voted that one of the consuls[31] should\r\nremain at Capua while the other defended them. It was Claudius who\r\nremained at Capua, for he had been wounded: Flaccus hastened to Rome.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Possibly an error on the part of Zonaras for\r\n_proconsuls_.]\r\n\r\nHannibal kept making raids all the time before their eyes and doing a\r\ngreat amount of harm, but for some time they were satisfied to\r\npreserve their possessions within the walls. When, however, he reached\r\nthe point of assaulting the city and their armies at once, they risked\r\nthe proverbial cast of the die and made a sortie. They were already\r\nengaged in skirmishing when [Sidenote: (FRAG. 56^33?)] AN\r\nEXTRAORDINARY STORM ACCOMPANIED BY AN INCONCEIVABLY STRONG WIND AS\r\nWELL AS THUNDER, HAIL, AND LIGHTNING, BROKE FROM A CLEAR SKY, so that\r\nboth were glad enough to flee as if by mutual consent back to the\r\nplace from which they had set out. They were just laying aside their\r\narms when the sky became clear. Although Hannibal concluded that the\r\nevent mentioned, coming as it did precisely at the moment of conflict,\r\nhad not occurred without divine ordering, yet he did not desist from\r\nhis siege operations and even attempted again on a subsequent occasion\r\nto force the issue. But when the same phenomena were met for the\r\nsecond time, he became terrified. What added to his alarm was that\r\nthe enemy though in so great danger did not withdraw from Capua and\r\nwere getting ready to send both soldiers and a praetor into Spain, and\r\nthat being in need of funds they sold the spot where he was encamped,\r\nwhich was a piece of public property. In despair he retired, often\r\ncrying aloud, \"Oh, Cannae, Cannae!\" And he no longer showed a\r\ndisposition to render aid to Capua.\r\n\r\nThe people of that city although in extremities were nevertheless\r\ndesperate, believing that they could not obtain pardon from the\r\nRomans, and they therefore held out and sent a letter to Hannibal\r\nbegging him to assist them. The bearers of the letter were seized by\r\nFlaccus (Claudius had before this time died of his wound) and had\r\ntheir hands cut off. Seeing them the Campanians were terribly dismayed\r\nand took counsel as to what they should do. After considerable talk a\r\ncertain Vibius Virius, one of the foremost men and most responsible\r\nfor the revolt, spoke, saying: \"Our only refuge and freedom lies in\r\ndeath. Escort me home. I have a poison made ready.\" So he took with\r\nhim those who were willing to accept his advice and with them\r\nvoluntarily gave up his life. The rest opened the gates to the Romans.\r\nFlaccus took possession of all their arms and money, killed some of\r\nthe head men and sent others to Rome. The only ones that he left\r\nunmolested were the survivors of the common people, and he spared them\r\nonly on condition that they receive a Roman governor, maintain no\r\nsenate, and hold no assembly.\r\n\r\nLater they subjected themselves to other disabilities by daring to\r\naccuse Flaccus. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^34] THE CAMPANIANS UNDERTOOK TO\r\nACCUSE FLACCUS AND THE SYRACUSANS MARCELLUS, when the latter was\r\nalready consul. And Marcellus made a defence, refusing to perform any\r\nof the duties of his office until he had defended himself. The\r\nSyracusans when given a hearing were rather sparing of their remarks\r\nand devoted themselves not to accusing Marcellus but to supplication\r\nand defence, showing that they had not of their own free will revolted\r\nfrom the Romans and begging that pardon be granted them. While\r\nuttering these words they fell upon the ground and bewailed their lot.\r\nWhen a decision was rendered, it was to the effect that Marcellus was\r\nnot guilty; that the Syracusans, however, were deserving of a certain\r\ndegree of kind treatment not for their acts but for their words and\r\nsupplications. As Marcellus asked to be excused from returning to\r\nSicily, they sent Laevinus. The Syracusans in this way obtained some\r\nconsideration: the Campanians, however, were led by stupidity to\r\ndeliver their accusation with too much audacity and were rebuked.\r\nFlaccus was not present, but one of his ex-lieutenants conducted his\r\ndefence for him.\r\n\r\nAfter the capture of Capua the other strongholds in the vicinity went\r\nover to the Romans, with the exception of Atellanae. The dwellers in\r\nthis town abandoned their city and went in a body to Hannibal. Also\r\nthe rest of Italy that favored the Carthaginian cause was being\r\ngradually estranged and the consuls in their tours of the country were\r\ntaking possession of it. The Tarentini did not as yet openly avow\r\ntheir allegiance to the Romans, but secretly they were getting tired\r\nof the Carthaginians.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 16, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 56^35] THE ROMANS MADE PROPOSITIONS TO HANNIBAL THAT\r\nBOTH SIDES SHOULD RETURN THEIR PRISONERS. THEY DID NOT EFFECT THE\r\nEXCHANGE BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT RECEIVE CARTHALO, AS BEING AN ENEMY,\r\nINSIDE OF THEIR WALLS. AND HE REFUSED TO HOLD ANY CONVERSATION WITH\r\nTHEM, BUT IMMEDIATELY TURNED BACK IN A RAGE.\r\n\r\nAt this time, moreover, Laevinus made friends with the AEtolians, who\r\nwere allies of Philip; and when Philip had advanced as far as Corcyra\r\nhe scared him away again so that the king returned to Macedonia with\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 210 (_a.u._ 544)] IX, 7.--The people of Rome sent\r\nGaius Claudius Nero with soldiers into Spain. He followed the line of\r\nthe coast with his fleet as far as the Iber, where he found the\r\nremainder of the Roman forces and confronted Hasdrubal before his\r\npresence had been made known. He enclosed the Carthaginians securely\r\nbut was then cheated out of the advantage gained. Hasdrubal, seeing\r\nthat he was cut off, sent heralds to Nero proposing to give up the\r\nwhole of Spain and leave the country. Nero gladly accepted the offer\r\nand his opponent postponed the settlement of the terms to the\r\nfollowing day. That night Hasdrubal quietly sent out a number of his\r\nmen to various parts of the mountains, and they got safely away\r\nbecause the Romans, in expectation of a truce, were not keeping any\r\nguard. The next day he held a conference with Nero but used up the\r\nwhole time without fixing upon anything definitely. That night he sent\r\noff other men in like manner. This he did similarly on several other\r\ndays while disputing about some points in the treaty. When the entire\r\ninfantry had gone in advance, he himself at last with the cavalry and\r\nelephants silently slipped away. He reached a place of safety and\r\nmanaged to make himself a source of anxiety to Nero subsequently.\r\n\r\nOn learning this the people of Rome condemned Nero and voted to\r\nentrust the leadership to somebody else. And they were at a loss whom\r\nto send, for the situation required no ordinary man and many were\r\nbreaking away from allegiance on account of the untimely fate of the\r\nScipios. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^37] THEREUPON THE FAMOUS PUBLIUS SCIPIO,\r\nWHO SAVED HIS WOUNDED FATHER, OFFERED HIMSELF VOLUNTARILY FOR THE WORK\r\nOF THE CAMPAIGN. HE SURPASSED IN EXCELLENCE AND WAS ALSO RENOWNED FOR\r\nHIS EDUCATION. He was chosen forthwith, but his supporters not long\r\nafter regretted their action because of his youth (he was in his\r\ntwenty-fourth year) and because his house was in mourning for the loss\r\nof his father and uncle. Accordingly he made a second public\r\nappearance and delivered a speech; and his words put the senators to\r\nshame, so that they did not, to be sure, release him from his command,\r\nbut sent Marcus Junius, an elderly man, to accompany him.\r\n\r\nAfter these events matters progressed without catastrophes for the\r\nRomans and gradually grew better. Marcellus after his acquittal before\r\nthe court had set out against Hannibal and was making nearly\r\neverything safe, though he was afraid to risk an engagement with men\r\ndriven to desperation. At any time that he was forced into a combat he\r\ncame out victorious as the result of prudence mingled with daring.\r\nHannibal now undertook to inflict injury upon those regions which he\r\nwas unable to occupy, being influenced by the reasons aforementioned\r\nas also by the fact that the cities in his alliance had either\r\nabandoned him or were intending to do so, and by some other causes. He\r\nhurt a great many and several towns deserted to the Romans for this\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the city of Salapia the following incident occurred.\r\nTwo men managed affairs there and were hostile to each other.\r\nAlinius[32] favored the Carthaginian cause, and Plautius[33] the\r\nRoman; and the latter talked with Alinius about betraying the place to\r\nthe Romans. Alinius at once informed Hannibal of the fact and Plautius\r\nwas brought to trial. While Hannibal was deliberating with the\r\ncouncilors as to how to punish him, Plautius dared in his presence to\r\nspeak again to Alinius, who stood near, about betrayal. The latter\r\ncried out: \"There, there, he's talking to me about this very matter\r\nnow.\" Hannibal distrusted him on account of the improbability of the\r\ncase and acquitted Plautius as a victim of blackmail. After his\r\nrelease the two men became harmonious and brought in soldiers obtained\r\nfrom Marcellus, with whose aid they cut down the Carthaginian garrison\r\nand delivered the city to the Romans.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: By comparing other authors the names Alinius and\r\nPlautius are found to be the corruptions of some copyists for Dasius\r\nand Blattius.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: [See previous footnote.]]\r\n\r\nThis was the state of Carthaginian interests in Italy. Not even Sicily\r\nretained its friendliness for them, but submitted to the consul\r\nLaevinus. The leader of the Carthaginians in Sicily was Hanno, and\r\nMuttines was a member of his staff. The latter had been with Hannibal\r\nformerly and owing to the latter's jealousy of his great deeds of\r\nvalor had been sent into Sicily. When there also he made a brilliant\r\nrecord as commander of the cavalry, he incurred the jealousy of Hanno\r\nas well, and as a consequence was deprived of his command. Deeply\r\ngrieved at this he joined the Romans. First he accomplished the\r\nbetrayal of Agrigentum for them and then he helped them in reducing\r\nother places, so that the whole of Sicily came again under their sway\r\nwithout any great labor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 209 (_a.u._ 545)] IX, 8.--Fabius and Flaccus subdued\r\namong other cities Tarentum, which Hannibal was holding. They gave\r\norders to a body of men to overrun Bruttium in order that Hannibal\r\nmight leave Tarentum and come to its assistance. When this had\r\nhappened, Flaccus kept watch of Hannibal while Fabius by night\r\nassailed Tarentum with ships and infantry at once and captured the\r\ncity by means of his assault aided by betrayal. Hannibal, enraged at\r\nthe trick, was eager to find some scheme for paying Fabius back. So he\r\nsent him a letter, purporting to be from the dwellers in Metapontum,\r\nlooking to a betrayal of the city; for he hoped that Fabius would\r\nadvance carelessly in that direction and that he might set a trap for\r\nhim on the way. But the Roman leader suspected the truth of the case\r\nand by comparing the writing with the letter which Hannibal had once\r\nwritten to the Tarentini, he detected the plot from the similarity of\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nScipio for the first part of the time, however much he may have longed\r\nto avenge his father and uncle and however much he yearned for glory\r\nin the war, nevertheless showed no haste on account of the multitude\r\nof his opponents. But after he ascertained that they were passing the\r\nwinter at a considerable distance, he disregarded them and marched\r\nupon Carthage,--the Spanish town. Moreover no one gained the slightest\r\nknowledge of his march till he had come close to Carthage itself. And\r\nby much exertion he took the city.\r\n\r\nFollowing the capture of Carthage a very great [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^39]\r\nMUTINY OF THE SOLDIERS came very near TAKING PLACE. Scipio had\r\npromised to give a crown to the first one that set foot on the wall,\r\nand two men, the one a Roman, the other belonging to the allies,\r\nquarreled over it. Their continued dispute promoted a disturbance\r\namong the rest as well and they became inflamed to the utmost degree\r\nand were ready to commit some fearful outrage when Scipio settled the\r\ntrouble by crowning both men. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^39] AND HE\r\nDISTRIBUTED MANY GIFTS TO THE SOLDIERS, ASSIGNING MANY ALSO TO PUBLIC\r\nUSES; AND ALL THE HOSTAGES WHO WERE BEING DETAINED THERE HE GAVE BACK\r\nFREELY TO THEIR RELATIVES. AS A RESULT MANY TOWNS AND MANY PRINCES\r\nESPOUSED HIS CAUSE, THE CELTIBERIAN RACE AMONG THE BEST. HE HAD TAKEN\r\nAMONG THE CAPTIVES A MAIDEN DISTINGUISHED FOR HER BEAUTY AND IT WAS\r\nTHOUGHT THAT HE WOULD FALL IN LOVE WITH HER; BUT WHEN HE LEARNED THAT\r\nSHE WAS BETROTHED TO ONE OF THE CELTIBERIAN MAGISTRATES, HE SENT FOR\r\nHIM AND DELIVERED THE YOUNG GIRL TO HIM, BESTOWING UPON HIM\r\nFURTHERMORE THE RANSOM WHICH HER KINSFOLK HAD BROUGHT FOR HER. BY THIS\r\nPROCEDURE HE ATTACHED TO HIS CAUSE BOTH THEM AND THE REMAINDER OF THE\r\nNATION.\r\n\r\nNext he learned that Hasdrubal the brother of Hannibal was approaching\r\nrapidly, still ignorant of the capture of the city and expecting to\r\nmeet no hostile force on his march. Scipio therefore confronted and\r\ndefeated him, and afterward bivouacked in his camp and got control of\r\nmany places in the vicinity. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^40] FOR HE WAS CLEVER\r\nIN STRATEGY, AGREEABLE IN SOCIETY, TERRIFYING TO OPPONENTS, AND\r\nTHOROUGHLY HUMANE TO SUCH AS YIELDED. AND ESPECIALLY THE RECOLLECTION\r\nTHAT HE HAD MADE A PREDICTION, SAYING BEFOREHAND THAT HE WOULD ENCAMP\r\nIN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY, CAUSED ALL TO HONOR HIM. THE SPANIARDS\r\nACTUALLY NAMED HIM \"GREAT KING.\"\r\n\r\nHasdrubal, giving up all hope, was anxious to leave Spain for Italy.\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 208 (_a.u._ 546)] So after packing everything for the\r\nmarch he started in winter. His fellow commanders held their ground\r\nand kept Scipio busy so that he could not pursue Hasdrubal nor lighten\r\nthe burden of war for the Romans in Italy by going there, nor sail to\r\nCarthage. But, although Scipio did not pursue Hasdrubal, he sent\r\nrunners through whom he apprised the people of Rome of his approach,\r\nand he himself gave attention to his own immediate concerns. As he saw\r\nthat his opponents were spread over a goodly portion of the country,\r\nhe dreaded that whenever he should begin an engagement with them, he\r\nshould be the cause of their gathering in one place through a\r\nnecessity of aiding one another. Accordingly, he conducted in person a\r\ncampaign against Hasdrubal, son of Gisco, and sent Silanus into\r\nCeltiberia against Mago, and also Lucius Scipio his brother into\r\nBastitania. Lucius occupied the district after hard fighting,\r\nconquered Mago, kept close at his heels as he fled to Hasdrubal, and\r\ncame to Scipio before the latter had accomplished anything as yet.\r\n\r\nNow that Mago had joined Hasdrubal and Lucius his brother Scipio, at\r\nfirst they would make descents into the plain and fight strenuously\r\nwith their cavalry, and later they would array their whole army in\r\nline of battle but did not do any fighting. This went on for several\r\ndays. When the clash finally came, the Carthaginians themselves and\r\ntheir allies were defeated, their stronghold was taken by the Romans,\r\nand the Romans made use of the provisions in it. This Scipio had\r\nprophesied, as the story goes, three days before. For when materials\r\nfor food had failed them he predicted--by what prompting is unknown--:\r\n\"On such and such a day we shall make use of the enemy's\r\nstore.\"--After this he left Silanus to take care of the surviving\r\nopponents and himself took his departure to the other cities, many of\r\nwhich he won over. When he had brought order into the newly acquired\r\nterritory he took up his winter abode there. His brother Lucius he\r\ndespatched to Rome to report the progress made, to convey the captives\r\nthither, and to investigate how the people of Rome felt toward him.\r\n\r\nIX, 9.--The dwellers in Italy had suffered from disease and had\r\nencountered hardships in battles, for some of the Etruscans had\r\nrebelled. But what grieved them more than all else was the fact that\r\nthey had lost Marcellus. They had been making a campaign against\r\nHannibal, who chanced to be at Locri, and both the consuls had been\r\nsurrounded by an ambuscade, Marcellus perishing instantly and\r\nCrispinus dying from a wound not long after. Hannibal found the body\r\nof Marcellus and taking his ring with which Marcellus was accustomed\r\nto seal his documents he would forward letters to the cities\r\npurporting to come from him. He was accomplishing whatever he pleased\r\nuntil Crispinus became aware of it and sent them a warning to be on\r\ntheir guard. As a result of this the tables were turned upon Hannibal.\r\nHe had sent a message to the citizens of Salapia through a fictitious\r\ndeserter, and approached the walls in the guise of Marcellus, using\r\nthe Latin language in company with other men who understood it, in\r\norder to be taken for Romans. The Salapini, informed of his artifice,\r\nwere artful enough in turn to pretend that they believed Marcellus was\r\nreally approaching. Then drawing up the portcullis they admitted as\r\nmany as it seemed to them they could conveniently dispose of and\r\nkilled them all. Hannibal withdrew at once on learning that Locri was\r\nbeing besieged by the Romans, who had sailed against it from Sicily.\r\n\r\nPublius Sulpicius assisted by AEtolians and other allies devastated a\r\nlarge part of Achaea. But as soon as Philip the Macedonian formed an\r\nalliance with the Achaeans, the Romans would have been driven out of\r\nGreece completely but for the fact that the helmet of Philip fell off\r\nand the AEtolians got possession of it. For in this way a report\r\nreached Macedonia that he was dead and a factional uprising took\r\nplace; Philip, consequently, fearing that he should be deprived of his\r\nkingdom, hastened to Macedonia. Then the Romans stuck to their places\r\nin Greece and conquered a few cities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 207 (_a.u._ 547)] The following year upon announcement\r\nof Hasdrubal's approach the people of Rome gathered their forces,\r\nsummoned their allies, and chose Claudius Nero and Marcus Livius\r\nconsuls. Nero they sent against Hannibal, Livius against Hasdrubal.\r\nThe latter met him near the city of Sena but did not immediately open\r\nengagement with him. For many days he remained stationary, and\r\nHasdrubal was in no hurry for battle, either, but remained at rest\r\nawaiting his brother. Nero and Hannibal entered Lucania to encamp and\r\nneither hastened to array his forces for battle, but in other ways\r\nthey had some conflicts. Hannibal kept constantly changing position\r\nand Nero kept careful watch of him. As he constantly had the advantage\r\nof him and ere long captured the letter sent to him by Hasdrubal, he\r\nbegan to despise Hannibal, but fearing that Hasdrubal might overwhelm\r\nLivius through mere numbers he ventured upon a hazardous exploit. He\r\nleft on the spot a portion of his force sufficient to check Hannibal\r\nin case the latter should make any movement, and he gave the men\r\ninjunctions to do everything to create the impression that he was also\r\nthere. He selected the flower of his army and started out apparently\r\nto attack some neighboring city, nor did any one know his true\r\nintentions. He hastened on, then, against Hasdrubal, reached his\r\ncolleague at night, and took up his quarters in the latter's\r\nentrenchments. Both made ready for a sudden attack upon the invader.\r\nThe situation did not go concealed, but Hasdrubal inferred what had\r\nhappened from the fact that the word of command was given twice; for\r\neach consul issued orders to his own troops separately. Suspecting\r\ntherefore that Hannibal had been defeated and had perished,--for he\r\ncalculated that if his brother were alive, Nero would never have\r\nmarched against _him_,--he determined to retire among the Gauls and\r\nthere find out definitely about his brother and so carry on the war at\r\nhis convenience.\r\n\r\nSo after giving orders to the army to break up he started out that\r\nnight, and the consuls from the noise suspected what was going on, yet\r\nthey did not move immediately because of the darkness. At dawn,\r\nhowever, they sent the cavalry ahead to pursue the enemy and they\r\nthemselves followed. Hasdrubal made a stand against the cavalry,\r\ndeeming them an isolated troop, but the consuls came up and routed him\r\nand followed after the fugitives, of whom they slaughtered many. Even\r\nthe elephants were of no help to the Carthaginians. Inasmuch as some\r\nof them that had been wounded did more harm to those in charge of them\r\nthan had been done by the enemy, Hasdrubal gave orders to those seated\r\nupon them to slay the beasts as fast as they got wounded. And they\r\nkilled them very easily by piercing them with an iron instrument under\r\nthe ear. So they were destroyed by the Carthaginians, but the men by\r\nthe Romans. So many fell that the Romans became surfeited with\r\nslaughter and did not wish to pursue the rest. They had destroyed\r\nHasdrubal along with many others, they had secured huge quantities of\r\nspoil, they had found Roman captives to the number of four thousand in\r\nthe camp, and thought they had sufficiently retrieved the disaster of\r\nCannae.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of these operations Livius stayed where he was, but\r\nNero returned to Apulia, reaching it on the sixth day; his absence up\r\nto that time had not been detected. Some of the prisoners he sent into\r\nHannibal's camp to explain what had happened, and he fixed Hasdrubal's\r\nhead on a pole nearby. Hannibal, learning that his brother was\r\nvanquished and dead, and that Nero had conquered and returned,\r\nlamented bitterly, often crying out upon Fortune and Cannae. And he\r\nretired into Bruttium where he remained inactive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 206 (_a.u._ 548)] IX, 10.--Scipio was detailed to\r\nsuperintend Roman interests in Spain till what time he should reach a\r\nsatisfactory adjustment of them all. First he sailed to Libya with two\r\nquinqueremes, and it so happened that Hasdrubal son of Gisco landed\r\nthere at the same time as he did. Syphax, who was king of a portion of\r\nLibya and had enjoyed friendly relations with the Carthaginians,\r\nentertained them both and endeavored to reconcile them. But Scipio\r\nsaid that he had no private enmity and he could not on his own\r\nresponsibility arrange terms for his country.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he went back again and began a war against the\r\nIliturgitani because they had handed over to the Carthaginians the\r\nRomans who took refuge with them after the death of the Scipios. He\r\ndid not make himself master of their city until he dared to scale the\r\nwall in person and got wounded. Then the soldiers, put to shame and\r\nfearing for his life, made a very vigorous assault. Having mastered\r\nthe situation they killed the whole population and burned down the\r\nentire city. As a result of the fear thus inspired many voluntarily\r\nranged themselves on his side, whereas many others had to be subdued\r\nby force. Some when subjected to siege burned their cities and slew\r\ntheir kinsmen and finally themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter subjugating the greater part of the country Scipio shifted his\r\nposition to Carthage and there instituted funeral combats in full\r\narmor in honor of his father and his uncle. When many others had\r\ncontended, there came also two brothers who continued at variance\r\nabout a kingdom, though Scipio had made efforts to reconcile them. And\r\nthe elder slew the younger in spite of the superior strength of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nSubsequently Scipio fell sick, and that was the signal for a rebellion\r\nof the Spaniards. One of Scipio's legions that was in winter quarters\r\nnear Sucro became restless. It had shown a lack of docility before\r\nthis, but had not ventured upon open rebellion. Now, however,\r\nperceiving that Scipio was incapacitated and influenced further by the\r\nfact that their pay had been slow in coming they mutinied outright,\r\ndrove away the tribunes, and elected consuls for themselves. Their\r\nnumber was about eight thousand. The Spaniards on ascertaining this\r\nrevolted with greater readiness and proceeded to damage the territory\r\nbelonging to the Roman alliance. Mago, who had intended to abandon\r\nGades, consequently did not abandon it, but crossed over to the\r\nmainland and wrought considerable mischief.\r\n\r\nScipio learning this wrote and sent a letter to apostate legion in\r\nwhich he affected to pardon them for revolting on account of the\r\nscarcity of the necessities of life, and did not seem to think it\r\nproper to view them with suspicion but conferred praise upon those who\r\nhad accepted their leadership for the purpose of preventing any\r\noutrage due to lack of government being either suffered or committed.\r\nWhen Scipio had written to this effect and the soldiers had learned\r\nthat he was alive and was not angry with them, they made no further\r\ndemonstrations. Even after he recovered his health he did not use\r\nharsh threats in dealing with them, but sent a promise to supply them\r\nwith food and invited them all to come to him either all together or\r\nonly a part at a time. The soldiers, not daring to go in small squads,\r\nwent in a body. Scipio arranged that they should bivouac outside the\r\nwall--for it was nearly evening--and furnished them provisions in\r\nabundance. So they encamped, but Scipio brought it about that the\r\nboldest spirits among them should enter the city, and during the night\r\nhe overpowered and imprisoned them. At daybreak he sent forth all his\r\narmy as if to go on an expedition somewhere. Then he called the recent\r\narrivals inside the wall without their weapons in order to join his\r\nundertaking after they had received their provision-money. As soon as\r\nthey had accordingly entered he signaled the men who had gone forth to\r\nreturn just as they were. Thus he surrounded the rebels and heaped\r\nupon them many reproaches and threats, saying finally: [Sidenote:\r\nFRAG. 56^42] \"YOU ALL DESERVE TO DIE: HOWEVER, I SHALL NOT PUT YOU ALL\r\nTO DEATH BUT I SHALL EXECUTE ONLY A FEW WHOM I HAVE ALREADY ARRESTED;\r\nTHE REST I SHALL RELEASE.\" With these words he set the prisoners in\r\ntheir midst, fixed them upon crosses, and after copious abuse killed\r\nthem. Some of the soldiers standing by grew indignant and raised an\r\noutcry, whereupon he punished a number of them also. After this he\r\ngave the rest their pay and conducted a campaign against Indibilis and\r\nMandonius. As they were too timid to offer him battle, he attacked and\r\nwas victorious.\r\n\r\nFollowing their capitulation most of the rest of Spain was again\r\nenslaved, Mago abandoned Gades, and Masinissa took the Roman side. The\r\nCarthaginians at news of the death of Hasdrubal, Hannibal's brother,\r\nhad voted to give up Spain but to recover their prestige in Italy. And\r\nthey sent money to Mago that he might gather a force of auxiliaries\r\nand lead a campaign against that country. He, setting out once more\r\nfor Italy, reached the Gymnasian islands. The larger one escaped his\r\ngrasp; the natives from a distance kept using their slings (in which\r\nart they were masters) against the ships, so that he could not effect\r\na landing: but he anchored off the smaller one and waited there on\r\naccount of the winter. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^44] THESE ISLANDS ARE\r\nSITUATED CLOSE TO THE MAINLAND IN THE VICINITY OF THE IBER.

He had\r\nleft the Carthaginians for the Romans as a result of circumstances now\r\nto be related. Hasdrubal the son of Gisco was a friend of his and had\r\nbetrothed to him his daughter Sophonis. Hasdrubal, however, became\r\nacquainted with Syphax and perceiving that he favored the Romans did\r\nnot keep his agreement with Masinissa any longer. He was so anxious to\r\nadd Syphax, who was lord of a very great power, to the Carthaginian\r\nalliance that when his father about this time died he helped him to\r\ntake possession of his domain, which properly belonged to Masinissa,\r\nand furthermore gave him Sophonis in marriage. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^46]\r\nSHE WAS CONSPICUOUS FOR BEAUTY, HAD BEEN TRAINED IN A LIBERAL LITERARY\r\nAND MUSICAL EDUCATION, WAS OF ATTRACTIVE MANNERS, COY, AND SO LOVABLE\r\nTHAT THE MERE SIGHT OF HER OR EVEN THE SOUND OF HER VOICE VANQUISHED\r\nEVEN A PERSON QUITE DEVOID OF AFFECTION.\r\n\r\nSyphax for these reasons attached himself to the Carthaginians, and\r\nMasinissa on the contrary took up with the Romans and from first to\r\nlast proved very useful to them. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^47] SCIPIO AFTER\r\nWINNING OVER THE WHOLE TERRITORY SOUTH OF THE PYRENEES, PARTLY BY\r\nFORCE, PARTLY BY TREATY, EQUIPPED HIMSELF TO JOURNEY TO LIBYA. THE\r\nPEOPLE OF ROME, HOWEVER, THROUGH JEALOUSY OF HIS SUCCESSES AND THROUGH\r\nFEAR THAT HE MIGHT BECOME ARROGANT AND PLAY THE TYRANT SENT TWO OF THE\r\nPRAETORS TO RELIEVE HIM AND CALLED HIM HOME.\r\n\r\nTHUS HE WAS DEPOSED FROM HIS COMMAND. BUT SULPICIUS TOGETHER WITH\r\nATTALUS OCCUPIED OREUS BY TREACHERY AND OPUS BY MAIN FORCE. PHILIP WAS\r\nUNABLE TO SEND THEM SPEEDY AID AS THE AETOLIANS HAD SEIZED THE PASSES\r\nIN ADVANCE. BUT AT LAST HE DID ARRIVE ON THE SCENE AND FORCED ATTALUS\r\nBACK TO HIS SHIPS. PHILIP, HOWEVER, WISHED TO CONCLUDE A TRUCE WITH\r\nTHE ROMANS. AND AFTER SOME PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION THE PEACE\r\nPROPOSITION WAS WITHDRAWN, BUT HE MOVED THE AETOLIANS OUT OF THEIR\r\nPOSITION OF ALLIANCE WITH THE ROMANS AND MADE THEM HIS OWN FRIENDS\r\nINSTEAD.\r\n\r\nHannibal for a time kept quiet, satisfied if he might only retain such\r\nadvantages as were already his. And the consuls thinking that his\r\npower had slowly wasted away without a battle also waited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 205 (_a.u._ 549)] The succeeding year Publius Scipio\r\nand [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^48] LICINIUS CRASSUS BECAME CONSULS. And THE\r\nLATTER STAYED IN ITALY, but Scipio had received orders to leave there\r\nfor Sicily and Libya to the end that in case he should not capture\r\nCarthage he might at least eventually draw Hannibal from Italy. He did\r\nnot succeed in securing an army of any real value nor in getting an\r\nexpenditure for triremes, because the honors accorded to his prowess\r\nhad made him an object of jealousy. The people would scarcely supply\r\nhim with the necessities. While he set out with the fleet of the\r\nallies and a few volunteers drawn from the populace, Mago left the\r\nisland and after sailing along the Italian coast disembarked in\r\nLiguria. Crassus was in Bruttium lying in wait for Hannibal. Philip,\r\nhowever, had become reconciled with the Romans; for on ascertaining\r\nthat Publius Sempronius had reached Apollonia with a large force he\r\nwas glad to make peace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: (FRAG. 56^50?)] Scipio the consul landed in Sicily and made\r\nready to sail to Libya, but he could not do so because he did not have\r\na complete force at his disposal and what he had was undisciplined.\r\nTherefore he resided there for the entire winter, drilling his\r\nfollowers and enrolling others in addition. As he was on the point of\r\nmaking the passage, a message came to him from Rhegium that some of\r\nthe citizens of Locri would betray the city. Having denounced the\r\ncommander of the garrison and obtained no satisfaction from Hannibal\r\nthey were now ready to go over to the Romans. Accordingly he sent a\r\ndetachment there and with the aid of the traitors seized a good part\r\nof the city during the night. The Carthaginians were huddled together\r\nin the citadel and sent for Hannibal, whereupon Scipio also set sail\r\nwith speed and by a sudden sally repulsed Hannibal when the latter was\r\nclose to the city. Next he captured the acropolis and, after\r\nentrusting the entire city to the care of the military tribunes,\r\nsailed back again. He was unable, however, to consummate his voyage to\r\nLibya. The Carthaginians so dreaded his advance that they despatched\r\nmoney to Philip to induce him to make a campaign against Italy, and\r\nsent grain and soldiers to Hannibal and to Mago ships and money that\r\nhe might prevent Scipio from crossing. The Romans, led by certain\r\nportents to expect a brilliant victory, entrusted to Scipio the army\r\nof Libya and gave him permission to enroll as large an additional\r\nforce as he should please. [Sidenote: B.C. 204 (_a.u._ 550)] Of the\r\nconsuls they set Marcus Cethegus over against Mago and Publius\r\nSempronius against Hannibal.\r\n\r\nIX, 12.--The Carthaginians, fearing that Masinissa would join Scipio,\r\npersuaded Syphax to restore his domain to him, the giver receiving\r\nassurance that he would get the tract back again. Masinissa was\r\nsuspicious of the transaction, yet agreed to peace, in order to win\r\nthe confidence of the Carthaginians and so be able to plunge them into\r\nsome great catastrophe. For he was more enraged over Sophonis than\r\nover the kingdom, and consequently worked for Roman interests while\r\naffecting to be for the Carthaginians. Syphax, who was a Libyan\r\nadherent, professed a friendliness for the Romans and sent to Scipio\r\nwarning him against crossing over. Scipio heard this as a piece of\r\nsecret information, and to prevent the knowledge of it from reaching\r\nthe soldiers he sent the herald back post-haste before he had had time\r\nto meet anybody else. Then he called together the army and hastened\r\nforward the preparations for crossing; he declared that the\r\nCarthaginians were unprepared and that first Masinissa and now Syphax\r\nwas calling for them and upbraiding them for lingering. After this\r\nspeech he suffered no further delay but set sail. He brought his ships\r\nto anchor near the cape called Apollonium, and [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n56^51] PITCHED HIS CAMP, DEVASTATED THE COUNTRY, MADE ASSAULTS UPON\r\nTHE CITIES AND CAPTURED A FEW. AS THE ROMANS WERE HARRYING THE\r\nCOUNTRY, HANNO THE CAVALRY COMMANDER, WHO WAS A SON OF HASDRUBAL SON\r\nOF GISCO, WAS PERSUADED BY MASINISSA TO ATTACK THEM. SCIPIO\r\nACCORDINGLY SENT SOME HORSEMEN AND WAS PLUNDERING SOME DISTRICTS THAT\r\nWERE SUITABLE FOR HIM TO OVERRUN, TO THE END THAT HIS MEN BY SIMULATED\r\nFLIGHT MIGHT DRAW UPON THEM THE PURSUERS. SO WHEN THEY TURNED TO FLEE,\r\nACCORDING TO PREVIOUS ARRANGEMENTS, AND THE CARTHAGINIANS FOLLOWED\r\nTHEM UP, MASINISSA WITH HIS FOLLOWERS GOT IN THE REAR OF THE PURSUERS\r\nAND ATTACKED THEM AND SCIPIO MAKING AN ONSET FROM HIS AMBUSH JOINED\r\nBATTLE WITH THEM. AND MANY WERE DESTROYED, MANY ALSO WERE CAPTURED,\r\nAMONG THEM HANNO HIMSELF. THEREFORE HASDRUBAL ARRESTED THE MOTHER OF\r\nMASINISSA, AND AN EXCHANGE OF THE TWO CAPTIVES WAS EFFECTED. SYPHAX\r\nNOW RENOUNCED EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF FRIENDSHIP FOR THE ROMANS AND\r\nOPENLY ATTACHED HIMSELF TO THE CARTHAGINIANS. AND THE ROMANS BOTH\r\nPLUNDERED THE COUNTRY AND RECOVERED MANY PRISONERS FROM ITALY WHO HAD\r\nBEEN SENT TO LIBYA BY HANNIBAL AND THEY WENT INTO WINTER QUARTERS\r\nWHERE THEY WERE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 203 (_a.u._ 551)] After this Gnaeus Scipio[37] and\r\nGaius Servilius became consuls, and during their year of office the\r\nCarthaginians, having got the worst of it in the struggle, felt a\r\ndesire to arrange terms of peace and furthermore both Hannibal and\r\nMago were driven out of Italy. It was the consuls who made a stand\r\nagainst Hannibal and Mago, while Scipio was inflicting damage upon\r\nLibya and assailing the cities. Meantime [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^52] HE\r\nHAD CAPTURED A CARTHAGINIAN VESSEL, BUT RELEASED IT WHEN THEY FEIGNED\r\nTO HAVE BEEN COMING ON AN EMBASSY TO HIM. HE KNEW, TO BE SURE, THAT IT\r\nWAS ONLY A PRETEXT, BUT PREFERRED TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF IT BEING\r\nSAID AGAINST HIM THAT HE HAD DETAINED ENVOYS. AND IN THE CASE OF\r\nSYPHAX, WHO WAS STILL ENDEAVORING TO NEGOTIATE A RECONCILIATION ON THE\r\nTERMS THAT SCIPIO SHOULD SAIL FROM LIBYA AND HANNIBAL FROM ITALY, HE\r\nRECEIVED HIS PROPOSITION NOT IN A TRUSTFUL MOOD, BUT TO THE END THAT\r\nHE MIGHT RUIN HIM. For on the excuse afforded by the postponed truce\r\nhe sent various bodies of soldiers at various times into the\r\nCarthaginian camp and into that of Syphax; and when they had carefully\r\ninspected everything on the side of their opponents, he put aside the\r\ntreaty on a plausible pretext, which was the more readily found\r\nbecause Syphax had been detected in a plot against Masinissa. And\r\nScipio went by night to where their two camps were located, not very\r\nfar apart, and secretly set fire to Hasdrubal's camp at many points at\r\nonce. It rapidly blazed up--for their tents had been made of\r\ncorn-stalks and leafy branches--and the Carthaginians fared badly. The\r\nfollowers of Syphax in attempting to aid them encountered the Romans,\r\nwho closed in the place, and were themselves destroyed; and their own\r\ncamp was set on fire in addition, and in it many men and horses\r\nperished. The Romans escaped injury during the rest of the night\r\nfollowing the exploit, but just after daylight Spaniards who had\r\nlately arrived as an accession to the Carthaginian alliance fell upon\r\nthem unexpectedly and killed a large number.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Dio probably wrote _Caepio_ here.]\r\n\r\nAs a result of all this Hasdrubal straightway retired to Carthage and\r\nSyphax to his own country. Scipio set Masinissa and Gaius Laelius to\r\noppose Syphax while he himself marched against the Carthaginians. The\r\nCarthaginians for their part sent ships toward the Roman stronghold,\r\nwhich the enemy were using as winter quarters and as a storehouse for\r\nall their goods. In this way they might either capture it or draw\r\nScipio away from themselves. Such also was the result. As soon as he\r\nheard of the manoeuvre, he withdrew and hurried to the harbor, which\r\nhe placed under guard. And on the first day the Romans easily repulsed\r\ntheir assailants, but on the next they had decidedly the worst of the\r\nencounter. The Carthaginians even went so far as to take away Roman\r\nships by seizing them with grappling irons. They did not venture,\r\nhowever, to disembark but finally sailed homewards, after which they\r\nsuperseded Hasdrubal and chose a certain Hanno in his place. From this\r\ntime Hanno was the general, but his predecessor privately got hold of\r\nsome slaves and deserters whom he welded together into a fairly strong\r\nforce; he then quietly persuaded some of the Spaniards who were\r\nserving in Scipio's army to help him and attempted one night to carry\r\nout a plot against the Roman's camp. Something would have come of it,\r\nhad not the soothsayers, dismayed by the actions of birds, and the\r\nmother of Masinissa, as a result of divinations, caused an\r\ninvestigation of the Spaniards to be made. So their treachery was\r\nanticipated and punished, and Scipio again made a campaign against\r\nCarthage; he was engaged in devastating their fields [IX, 13.] while\r\nSyphax was waging war upon the followers of Laelius. That prince\r\noffered successful resistance for some time, but eventually the Romans\r\nprevailed, slaughtered many, took many alive, and captured Syphax.\r\nThey also acquired possession of Cirta, his palace, without a contest\r\nby displaying to the guardians within their king, now a prisoner.\r\n\r\nIt was there that Sophonis also was. Masinissa at once rushed toward\r\nher and embracing her said: \"I hold Syphax that snatched thee away. I\r\nhold thee also. Fear not. Thou hast not become a captive, since thou\r\nhast me as an ally.\" After these words he married her on the spot,\r\nanticipating any action on the part of the Romans out of fear that he\r\nmight somehow lose her, were she reckoned among the spoil. Then he\r\nassumed control of the rest of the cities of Syphax also. [Sidenote:\r\nFRAG. 56^53] AND THEY BROUGHT TO SCIPIO ALONG WITH THE OTHER PROPERTY\r\nSYPHAX HIMSELF. AND THE COMMANDER WOULD NOT CONSENT TO SEE HIM REMAIN\r\nBOUND IN CHAINS, BUT CALLING TO MIND HIS ENTERTAINMENT AT THE OTHER'S\r\nCOURT AND REFLECTING ON HUMAN POSSIBILITIES HE LEAPED FROM HIS CHAIR,\r\nLOOSED HIM, EMBRACED HIM, AND TREATED HIM WITH RESPECT. Once he asked\r\nhim: \"What possessed you to go to war with us?\" Syphax excused\r\nhimself skillfully and at the same time made himself secure against\r\nMasinissa by declaring that Sophonis had been responsible for his\r\nattitude. To please her father Hasdrubal she had ensnared him by\r\nwitchcraft against his will to espouse the Carthaginian cause. \"At any\r\nrate,\" he went on, \"I have paid a proper penalty for being hoodwinked\r\nby a woman, and in the midst of my evils have at least one\r\nconsolation,--that Masinissa has married her. For she will certainly\r\nbring about his utter ruin likewise.\"\r\n\r\nScipio feeling suspicious about this action of Masinissa called him\r\nand censured him for having so speedily married a woman taken captive\r\nfrom the enemy without the commanding officer's consent, and he bade\r\nhim give her up to the Romans. Masinissa, thoroughly distracted,\r\nrushed into the tent where Sophonis was and cried out to her: \"If I\r\nmight by my own death ensure thee liberty and freedom from outrage, I\r\nwould cheerfully die for thee; but since this is impossible, I send\r\nthee before me whither I and all shall come.\" With these words he held\r\nout poison to her. And she uttered neither lament nor groan but with\r\nmuch nobility made answer: \"Husband, if this is thy will, I am\r\ncontent. My soul shall after thee know no other lord: for my body, if\r\nScipio require it, let him take it with life extinct.\" Thus she met\r\nher death, and Scipio marveled at the deed.\r\n\r\nLaelius conducted to Rome Syphax and his son Vermina and some others of\r\nthe foremost men; and the citizens gave Syphax an estate at Alba,\r\nwhere at his death they honored him with a public funeral, and\r\nconfirmed Vermina in the possession of his father's kingdom besides\r\nbestowing upon him the captured Nomads.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 56^54] THE CARTHAGINIANS WHILE MAKING PROPOSITIONS TO\r\nSCIPIO THROUGH HERALDS GAVE HIM MONEY AT ONCE AND GAVE BACK ALL THE\r\nPRISONERS, BUT IN REGARD TO THE REMAINING MATTERS THEY DESPATCHED AN\r\nEMBASSY TO ROME. HOWEVER, THE ROMANS WOULD NOT RECEIVE THE ENVOYS AT\r\nTHAT TIME, DECLARING THAT IT WAS A TRADITION IN THE STATE NOT TO ADMIT\r\nAN EMBASSY FROM ANY PARTIES AND NEGOTIATE WITH THEM IN REGARD TO PEACE\r\nWHILE THEIR ARMIES WERE STILL IN ITALY. LATER, WHEN HANNIBAL AND MAGO\r\nHAD EMBARKED, THEY ACCORDED THE ENVOYS AN AUDIENCE AND VOTED THE\r\nPEACE. But Hannibal and Mago departed from Italy not on account of the\r\ntentative arrangements but through haste to reach the scene of war at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe Carthaginians in Libya were not thinking seriously of peace even\r\nbefore this and had made propositions about a truce only for the\r\npurpose of using up time and with a view to securing Hannibal's\r\npresence. When they heard that Hannibal was really drawing near, they\r\ntook courage [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^55] AND ATTACKED SCIPIO BOTH BY LAND\r\nAND BY SEA. WHEN THE LATTER COMPLAINED TO THEM ABOUT THIS, THEY\r\nRETURNED NO PROPER ANSWER TO THE ENVOYS AND ACTUALLY PLOTTED AGAINST\r\nTHEM WHEN THEY SAILED BACK; AND HAD NOT A WIND FORTUNATELY ARISEN TO\r\nHELP THEM, THEY WOULD HAVE PERISHED. HENCE SCIPIO, THOUGH AT THIS TIME\r\nTHE VOTE REGARDING PEACE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM, REFUSED ANY LONGER TO\r\nMAKE IT. So the Carthaginians sent Mago back to Italy, but deposed\r\nHanno from his command and appointed Hannibal general with full\r\npowers. Hasdrubal they even voted to put to death, and finding that he\r\nhad by poison intentionally compassed his own destruction they abused\r\nhis dead body. Hannibal having secured complete leadership invaded the\r\ncountry of Masinissa, where he proceeded to do mischief and made ready\r\nto fight against the Romans. Counter-preparations were made by the\r\nfollowers of Scipio.\r\n\r\nIX, 14.--The people of Rome were regretting that they had not\r\nprevented the return voyage of Hannibal, and when they learned that he\r\nwas consolidating the opposition in Libya, they were again terrified\r\nbeyond measure. [Sidenote: B.C. 202 (_a.u._ 552)] Accordingly they\r\nsent Claudius Nero, one of the consuls, to attend to him, and allotted\r\nto Marcus Servilius the protection of Italy. Nevertheless Nero was not\r\nable to reach Libya, being detained in Italy by stormy weather and\r\nagain at Sardinia. After that he progressed no farther than Sicily,\r\nfor he learned that Scipio had proved the victor. Scipio, indeed, was\r\nafraid that Nero might be so prompt as to appropriate the glory that\r\nproperly was the fruit of his own toils, and so, at the very first\r\nglimmer of spring, he took up his march against Hannibal; he had\r\nalready received information that the latter had conquered Masinissa.\r\nHannibal, upon ascertaining the approach of Scipio, did not wait, but\r\nwent out to meet him. They encamped opposite each other and did not at\r\nonce come to blows, but delayed several days; and each commander\r\naddressed words to his own army and incited it to battle.\r\n\r\nWhen it seemed best to Scipio not to delay any further but to involve\r\nHannibal in conflict whether he wished it or not, he set out for\r\nUtica, that by creating an impression of fear and flight he might gain\r\na favorable opportunity for attack; and this was what took place.\r\nHannibal, thinking that he was in flight and being correspondingly\r\nencouraged, pursued him with cavalry only. Contrary to his\r\nexpectations Scipio resisted, engaged in battle and came out\r\nvictorious. After routing this body he directed his next attentions\r\nnot to pursuing them but to their equipment train, which chanced to be\r\non the march, and he captured it entire. This behavior caused Hannibal\r\nalarm, an alarm increased by the news that Scipio had done no injury\r\nto three Carthaginian spies whom he had found in his camp. Hannibal\r\nhad learned this fact from one of them, for the other two had chosen\r\nto remain with the Romans. Disheartened and confused he no longer felt\r\nthe courage to carry on a decisive engagement with the Romans, but\r\ndetermined to make efforts for a truce as quickly as possible, in\r\norder that if this attempt should not be successful, it might at least\r\ncause a temporary delay and cessation of hostilities. So he sent to\r\nMasinissa, and through him as a man of the same stock asked for a\r\ntruce. And he secured a conference with Scipio, but accomplished\r\nnothing. For Scipio avoided a definite answer as much as he did a\r\nharsh one, but throughout pursued a middle course, albeit preserving\r\nan agreeable tone, in order to lead Hannibal into careless behavior by\r\npretending a willingness to come to terms. Such was the result.\r\nHannibal now gave no thought to battle, but concerned himself with a\r\ndesire to change his camp to a more favorable location. Scipio,\r\ngaining this information from deserters, broke up beforehand by night\r\nand occupied the spot which was the goal of Hannibal's striving. And\r\nwhen the Carthaginians had reached a depressed part of the road\r\nunsuited for encampment he suddenly confronted them. Hannibal refused\r\nto fight and in his efforts to locate a camp there and to dig wells he\r\nhad a hard time of it all night long. Thus Scipio forced the enemy,\r\nwhile at a disadvantage from weariness and thirst, to offer battle\r\nwhether pleased or not.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the Romans entered the conflict well marshaled and eager,\r\nbut Hannibal and the Carthaginians listlessly and in dejection, a\r\ndejection for which a total eclipse of the sun at this time was\r\nlargely accountable. From this combination of circumstances Hannibal\r\nsuspected that this, too, foreboded to them nothing auspicious. In\r\nthis frame of mind they stationed the elephants in front of them as a\r\nprotection. Suddenly the Romans emitted a great, bloodcurdling shout,\r\nand smiting their spears against their shields advanced with\r\ndetermination and on a run against the elephants. Thrown into a panic\r\nby the onset most of the beasts did not await the enemy's approach,\r\nbut turned to flee and receiving frequent wounds wrought greater\r\nturmoil among their keepers. Others entered the fray, and then the\r\nRomans would stand apart and the animals ran through the spaces in\r\ntheir ranks, getting struck and wounded from close at hand as they\r\npassed along. For a time the Carthaginians resisted, but at length,\r\nwhen Masinissa and Laelius fell upon them from the rear with horsemen,\r\nthey all fled. The majority of them were destroyed and Hannibal came\r\nvery near losing his life. As he fled, Masinissa pursued him at\r\nbreakneck speed, giving his horse free rein. Hannibal turned and saw\r\nhim in mad career; he swerved aside just slightly, [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n56^57] AND CHECKED HIS FORWARD COURSE: Masinissa rushed by and\r\nHannibal got behind and wounded him. Shortly after with a few\r\nattendants the Carthaginian leader made good his escape.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 201 (_a.u._ 553)] Scipio followed up his victory by a\r\nrapid advance against Carthage and proceeded to besiege it by land and\r\nsea at once. The Carthaginians at first set themselves in readiness as\r\nthough to endure the siege, but later, brought to the end of their\r\nresources, [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^62] THEY MADE OVERTURES TO SCIPIO FOR\r\nPEACE. Scipio accepted their proposals and discussed with them the\r\narticles of the compact. THE TERMS AGREED UPON WERE: THAT THE HOSTAGES\r\nAND THE CAPTIVES AND THE DESERTERS SHOULD BE GIVEN UP BY THE\r\nCARTHAGINIANS, THAT ALL THE ELEPHANTS AND THE TRIREMES (SAVE TEN)\r\nSHOULD BE DELIVERED OVER, AND THAT IN THE FUTURE THEY SHOULD NOT KEEP\r\nELEPHANTS NOR MORE SHIPS OF WAR THAN TEN, NOR MAKE WAR UPON ANY ONE\r\nCONTRARY TO THE ADVICE AND CONSENT OF THE ROMANS, and a few other\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nWHEN AN AGREEMENT OF THIS NATURE HAD BEEN REACHED, THE CARTHAGINIANS\r\nDESPATCHED AMBASSADORS TO ROME. [Sidenote: (FRAG. 56^63?)] SO THEY\r\nWENT THEIR WAY, BUT THE SENATE DID NOT RECEIVE THE EMBASSY READILY;\r\nINDEED, ITS MEMBERS DISPUTED FOR A LONG TIME, ONE PARTY BEING OPPOSED\r\nTO ANOTHER. [Sidenote: FRAG. 56^64] THE POPULAR ASSEMBLY, HOWEVER,\r\nUNANIMOUSLY VOTED FOR PEACE AND ACCEPTED THE AGREEMENT AND SENT TEN\r\nMEN THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH SCIPIO THEY MIGHT SETTLE ALL THE DETAILS.\r\nAND THE TREATY WAS ACCEPTED, THE TRIREMES WERE GIVEN UP AND BURNED,\r\nAND OF THE ELEPHANTS THE LARGER NUMBER WERE CARRIED OFF TO ROME, AND\r\nTHE REST WERE PRESENTED TO MASINISSA. THE ROMANS NOW ABANDONED LIBYA,\r\nAND THE CARTHAGINIANS ITALY.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND WAR, THEN, WITH THE CARTHAGINIANS RESULTED IN THIS WAY AT\r\nTHE END OF SIXTEEN YEARS. BY IT SCIPIO HAD BEEN MADE ILLUSTRIOUS, AND\r\nHE WAS GIVEN THE TITLE OF AFRICANUS (AFRICA WAS THE NAME OF THAT PART\r\nOF LIBYA SURROUNDING CARTHAGE), AND MANY ALSO CALLED HIM \"LIBERATOR\"\r\nBECAUSE HE HAD BROUGHT BACK MANY CAPTIVE CITIZENS. HE THEREFORE\r\nATTAINED GREAT PROMINENCE BY THESE DEEDS, BUT HANNIBAL WAS ACCUSED BY\r\nHIS OWN PEOPLE OF HAVING REFUSED TO CAPTURE ROME WHEN HE WAS ABLE TO\r\nDO SO, AND OF HAVING APPROPRIATED THE PLUNDER IN ITALY. HE WAS NOT,\r\nHOWEVER, CONVICTED, BUT WAS SHORTLY AFTER ENTRUSTED WITH THE HIGHEST\r\nOFFICE IN CARTHAGE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 57^1] IX, 15.--THE ROMANS NOW BECAME INVOLVED IN\r\nOTHER WARS, which were waged against Philip the Macedonian and against\r\nAntiochus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 18, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\nAs long as the struggle with the Carthaginians was at its height they\r\ntreated Philip with consideration even if his attitude toward them was\r\nnot one of friendliness; for they wished to prevent him from\r\nconsolidating with the Carthaginians or leading an expedition into\r\nItaly. But when the previous hostilities had come to a standstill,\r\nthey did not wait a moment, but embarked upon open warfare with him,\r\nwhich they justified by the presentation of many complaints.\r\nAccordingly, the Romans sent envoys to him, and when he complied with\r\nnone of their orders, voted for war. They used his descent upon the\r\nGreeks as a pretext, but their real reason was irritation at his\r\ngeneral behavior and a determination to anticipate him, so that he\r\nshould not be able to enslave Greece and conduct a campaign against\r\nItaly after the fashion of Pyrrhus. [Sidenote: B.C. 200 (_a.u._ 554)]\r\nAs a consequence of their vote they made effective preparations in all\r\ndepartments and they associated with Sulpicius Galba Lucius Apustius\r\nas legatus in charge of the fleet. Galba after crossing the Ionian\r\nGulf was sick for some time; accordingly the aforementioned legatus\r\nand the sub-lieutenant Claudius Cento assumed charge of his entire\r\nforce. The second of these with the aid of the fleet rescued Athens,\r\nwhich was being besieged by the Macedonians, and sacked Chalcis, which\r\nwas occupied by the same enemy. Philip returned just then, having\r\nfinished his campaign against Athens, but Cento drove him back at his\r\nfirst approach and repulsed him again on the occasion of a subsequent\r\nassault. Apustius, while Philip was busy with Greece, had invaded\r\nMacedonia, and was plundering the country as well as making garrisons\r\nand cities subject. For these reasons Philip found himself in a\r\nquandary, and for a time scurried about hither and thither, defending\r\nnow one place, now another. This he did until Apustius proved himself\r\na mighty menace to his country and the Dardanians were injuring the\r\npart of Macedonia close to their borders [Sidenote: FRAG. 57^2] (THIS\r\nPEOPLE DWELL ABOVE THE ILLYRIANS AND THE MACEDONIANS) and some\r\nIllyrians together with Amynander king of the Athamanians, a\r\nThessalian tribe, though they had previously been his allies now\r\ntransferred themselves to the Roman side. In view of these events he\r\nconceived a suspicion of AEtolian loyalty and began to fear for his\r\ninterests at home, and he hastened thither with the larger part of his\r\narmy. Apustius, apprised of his approach, retired, for by this time it\r\nwas winter.\r\n\r\nGalba on recovering from his illness made ready a still larger force\r\nand at the beginning of spring pushed forward into Macedonia. When the\r\ntwo leaders drew near each other they [Sidenote: FRAG. 57^3] BOTH\r\nPITCHED CAMP AND CONDUCTED SKIRMISHES OF THE HORSE AND LIGHT-ARMED\r\nTROOPS. WHEN THE ROMANS TRANSFERRED THEIR CAMP TO A CERTAIN SPOT FROM\r\nWHICH THEY COULD GET FOOD MORE EASILY, PHILIP DECIDED THAT THEY HAD\r\nSHIFTED POSITION OUT OF FEAR OF HIM; THEREFORE HE ATTACKED THEM\r\nUNEXPECTEDLY WHILE THEY WERE ENGAGED IN PLUNDERING AND KILLED A FEW OF\r\nTHEM. AND GALBA ON PERCEIVING THIS MADE A SORTIE FROM THE CAMP,\r\nATTACKED HIM AND SLEW MANY MORE IN RETURN. PHILIP, THEN, IN VIEW OF\r\nHIS DEFEAT AND THE FACT THAT HE WAS WOUNDED, WITHDREW JUST AFTER\r\nNIGHTFALL. GALBA, HOWEVER, DID NOT FOLLOW HIM UP BUT RETIRED TO\r\nAPOLLONIA. APUSTIUS WITH THE RHODIANS AND WITH ATTALUS CRUISED ABOUT\r\nAND SUBJUGATED MANY OF THE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time [Sidenote: FRAG. 57^4] HAMILCAR, A CARTHAGINIAN\r\nWHO HAD MADE A CAMPAIGN WITH MAGO IN ITALY AND REMAINED THERE\r\nUNNOTICED, AFTER A TERM OF QUIET CAUSED THE GAULS AS SOON AS THE\r\nMACEDONIAN WAR BROKE OUT TO REVOLT FROM THE ROMANS; THEN WITH THE\r\nREBELS HE MADE AN EXPEDITION AGAINST THE LIGURIANS AND WON OVER SOME\r\nOF THEM ALSO. THEY FOUGHT WITH LUCIUS FURIUS THE PRAETOR, WERE\r\nDEFEATED, AND SENT ENVOYS ABOUT PEACE. THE LIGURIANS OBTAINED THIS,\r\nbut it was not granted to the others. Instead, Aurelius the consul,\r\nwho was jealous of the praetor's victory, led a new campaign against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 199 (_a.u._ 555)] The succeeding year a great deal of\r\nhavoc was wrought by Hamilcar and the Gauls. They conquered the praetor\r\nGnaeus Baebius, overran the territory which was in alliance with the\r\nRomans, besieged Placentia, and capturing it razed it to the ground.\r\n\r\nIX, 16.--To return to the campaign in Greece and Macedonia--Publius\r\nVillius the consul was encamped opposite Philip, who had occupied in\r\nadvance the passes of Epirus through which are the entrances to\r\nMacedonia. Philip had extended a wall across the entire mountain\r\nregion in between and held a formidable position, [Sidenote: B.C. 198\r\n(_a.u._ 556)] but the consul Titus Flamininus[38] at the conclusion\r\nof winter got around the circumvallation with a few followers by a\r\nnarrow path. And appearing suddenly on higher ground he terrified\r\nPhilip, who thought that the whole army of Titus had come up through\r\nthe pass. Hence he fell back into Macedonia at once. The consul did\r\nnot pursue him, but assumed control of the cities in Epirus. He also\r\nwent into Thessaly and detached a good part of it from Philip and then\r\nretired into Phocis and Boeotia. While he was besieging Elatea his\r\nbrother Lucius Flamininus in company with Attalus and the Rhodians was\r\nsubduing the islands. Finally, after the capture of Cenchrea, they\r\nlearned that envoys had been sent to the Achaeans to see about an\r\nalliance and they despatched some themselves in turn, the Athenians\r\nassociating in the embassy. And at first the opinions of the Achaeans\r\nwere divided, some wanting to vote their alliance to Philip and some\r\nto the Romans; eventually, however, they voted assistance to the\r\nlatter. And they joined in an expedition against Corinth, where they\r\nsucceeded in demolishing portions of the wall, but retired after\r\nlosses suffered through sallies of the citizens.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Zonaras consistently spells _Flaminius_.]\r\n\r\nThen Philip, growing afraid that many cities might be taken, made\r\novertures to the consul regarding peace. The latter accepted his\r\nrepresentations and they and their allies met, but nothing was\r\naccomplished except that permission was granted Philip to send envoys\r\nto Rome. Nor was anything done there. For, when the Greeks insisted\r\nthat he depart from Corinth and Chalcis and from Demetrias in\r\nThessaly, the envoys of Philip said they had received no instructions\r\non this point and closed an ineffectual mission.\r\n\r\nThe people of Rome in voting to Flamininus the supreme direction in\r\nGreece for another year also committed to his charge the case of\r\nPhilip as well. The Roman leader, since he was to remain at his post,\r\nprepared for war, and the more so because the Lacedaemonian tyrant\r\nNabis, although a friend of Philip from whom he had received Argos,\r\nhad made a truce with him. The Macedonian monarch being unable to\r\nadminister many districts at once and fearing that the city might be\r\nseized by the Romans had deposited it with Nabis to be restored again.\r\n\r\nIn a campaign of the consul AElius Paetus against the Gauls many\r\nperished on both sides in the stress of conflict and no advantage was\r\nachieved. And the Carthaginian hostages together with the slaves\r\naccompanying them and the captives who had been sold to various\r\npersons had the hardihood to take possession of the several cities in\r\nwhich they were living; and after slaughtering many of the native\r\npopulation were overthrown by the praetor Cornelius Lentulus before\r\nthey had wrought any more mischief. The Gauls, however, elated by\r\ntheir successes and aware of the fact that it was only a secondary war\r\nthe Romans were waging against them prepared as if to march upon Rome.\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 197 (_a.u._ 557)] The Romans consequently became\r\nafraid and sent both the consuls, Cornelius Cethegus and Minucius\r\nRufus, against the Gauls. They parted company and individually ravaged\r\ndifferent tracts of country. The enemy accordingly also divided\r\nforces to meet the consuls. One band under Hamilcar encountered\r\nCethegus and was defeated; the rest when made aware of this showed the\r\nwhite feather and would no longer face Rufus; consequently the latter\r\noverran the country at will. Those who had fought against Cethegus\r\nthen made peace; the remainder still continued under arms.\r\n\r\nAt this time Flamininus in company with Attalus reduced the whole of\r\nBoeotia. Attalus expired of old age in the midst of a speech which\r\nhe was making to the people there. Flamininus went into Thessaly and\r\ncame into collision with Philip. It was only a cavalry skirmish in\r\nwhich they engaged, for the ground was not suitable for a battle on a\r\nvaster scale; hence both withdrew. And having reached a certain hill,\r\nthe top ridge of which is called Dog's Head (Cynoscephale), they\r\nbivouacked, one on one side, the other on the other. Here also they\r\nfought with their entire armies, and the outcome would have left both\r\nwith equal honors if the AEtolians had not made the Romans superior. So\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 58] PHILIP WAS DEFEATED and fled, and afterward,\r\nlearning that Larissa and the cities surrounding it had chosen to\r\nfollow the fortunes of the victors, HE SENT HERALDS TO FLAMININUS. AND\r\nHE MADE A TRUCE as soon as Philip had given money and hostages, among\r\nthem his own son Demetrius, and had sent out envoys to Rome in regard\r\nto peace.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of these transactions Androsthenes also had been\r\nvanquished by the Achaeans and had lost Corinth. And Lucius Flamininus\r\nwho was in charge of the fleet, when he could not persuade the\r\nAcarnanians to refrain from allying themselves with Philip, besieged\r\nand captured Leucas; later they became aware of Philip's defeat and he\r\nsecured their submission with greater ease.\r\n\r\nThus was the Macedonian war terminated and the people of Rome very\r\nreadily became reconciled with Philip upon the following terms. He\r\nshould restore the captives and deserters; give up the elephants and\r\ntriremes save five (including the flagship, a vessel of sixteen\r\nbanks), pay an indemnity, part at once, the rest in definite\r\ninstallments; be king of Macedonia alone; not keep more than five\r\nthousand soldiers, nor make war with any person outside his own\r\ncountry. For the rest of the cities situated in Asia and Europe which\r\nwere previously subservient to him they let go free.\r\n\r\nThe consuls waged once more with the Gauls a war not unfraught with\r\ndifficulties, yet in spite of all they got the better of this people,\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 195 (_a.u._ 559)] IX, 17.--Porcius Cato being chosen\r\nconsul won back Spain, which had been almost entirely alienated. He\r\nwas a man who surpassed those of his age in every virtue. Now after\r\nthe defeat inflicted upon the Romans at Cannae a law had been passed to\r\nthe effect that women should not wear gold nor be carried in chairs\r\nnor make use at all of variegated clothing; and the people were\r\ndeliberating as to whether they ought to abolish this law. And on this\r\nsubject Cato delivered a speech in which he made out that the law\r\nought to prevail, and finally he added these words: \"Let the women,\r\nthen, be adorned not with gold nor precious stones nor with any bright\r\nand transparent clothing, but with modesty, with love of husband, love\r\nof children, persuasion, moderation, with the established laws, with\r\nour arms, our victories, our trophies.\"--Lucius Valerius, a tribune,\r\nspoke in opposition to Cato, urging that the privilege of the old-time\r\nornament be restored to the women. After speaking at length in this\r\nvein to the people he then directed his discourse to a consideration\r\nof Cato, and said: \"You, Cato, if you are displeased at women's\r\nornaments and wish to do something magnificent and befitting a\r\nphilosopher, clip their hair close all around and put on them short\r\nfrocks and tunics with one shoulder; yes, by Jove, you go ahead and\r\ngive them armor and mount them on horses and, if you like, take them\r\nto Spain; and let's bring them in here, so that they may take part in\r\nour assemblies.\" Valerius said this in jest, but the women hearing him\r\n(many of them were hanging about near the Forum inquisitive to know\r\nhow the affair would come out) rushed into the assembly denouncing the\r\nlaw; and accordingly, as it was speedily repealed, they put on some\r\nornaments right there in the assembly and went out dancing.\r\n\r\nCato sailed away and reached Spain. There he learned that all the\r\ndwellers as far as the Iber had united in order to wage war against\r\nhim in a body. After organizing his army he attacked and defeated them\r\nand forced them to submit to him. They did so in the fear that\r\notherwise they might lose the cities at a single stroke. At the time\r\nhe did them no harm, but later when some of them incurred his\r\nsuspicion, he deprived them all of arms and made the natives\r\nthemselves tear down their own walls. Letters were sent in every\r\ndirection with orders that they should be delivered to everybody on\r\nthe same day; and in these he commanded the people to raze the circuit\r\nof their fortifications instanter, threatening the disobedient with\r\ndeath. Those occupying official positions when they had read them\r\nthought in each case that the message had been written to them alone,\r\nand without taking time for deliberation they all threw down their\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nCato now crossed the Iber, and though he did not dare to contend with\r\nthe Celtiberian allies of the enemy on account of their number, yet he\r\nhandled them in marvelous fashion, now persuading them by a gift of\r\nlarger pay to change front and join him, now admonishing them to\r\nreturn home, sometimes even announcing a battle with them for a stated\r\nday. The result of it all was that they broke up into separate\r\nfactions and became so fearful that they no longer ventured to fight\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 19, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\nIX, 18.--At this time Flamininus, too, made a campaign against Argos,\r\nfor the Romans seeing that Nabis was not loyal to them and was a\r\nsource of terror to the Greeks treated him as an enemy. With an\r\naccession of allies from Philip Flamininus marched upon Sparta,\r\ncrossed Taygetus without effort and advanced toward the city, meeting\r\nwith no opposition. For Nabis, being afraid of the Romans and\r\nsuspicious of the natives, did not rouse himself to the point of\r\nmeeting Flamininus at a distance; but when the latter came nearer he\r\nmade a hostile excursion from the town, thinking lightly of his\r\nopponent because of the fatigue of the journey and because Flamininus\r\nwas kept employed by the business of encamping; and he did cause a few\r\nflurries. The next day he came out to face the Romans when they\r\nassaulted, but as he lost large numbers he did not come out again. So\r\nFlamininus, leaving a portion of his army there to prevent a warlike\r\ndemonstration anywhere, with the rest turned his attention to the\r\ncountry districts; these he ravaged with the aid of his brother and\r\nthe Rhodians and Eumenes, son of Attalus. Nabis was consequently in\r\ndespair and despatched a herald to Flamininus about peace. The latter\r\nlistened to his proposals but did not immediately cease hostilities.\r\nFor Nabis did not dare to refuse the arrangements which he was asked\r\nto make, nor yet would he consent to make them. And the populace\r\nprevented him from coming to an agreement. So temporarily Nabis did\r\nnot come to terms, but when the Romans attacked again and captured\r\nalmost all of Sparta (it was in part destitute of a wall), he would\r\nwait no longer, but made a truce with Flamininus and by sending an\r\nembassy to Rome effected a settlement.\r\n\r\nFlamininus hereupon set all the Greeks free; [Sidenote: B.C. 194\r\n(_a.u._ 560)] later he convened them in session and after reminding\r\nthem of the benefits they had received urged them to maintain a kindly\r\nattitude toward the Romans: he then withdrew all their garrisons and\r\ndeparted with his entire army.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of Flamininus at Rome Nabis rebelled. And straightway\r\nthe whole Greek world, so to speak, was thrown into a turmoil which\r\nthe AEtolians did their best to increase. They were making ready for\r\nwar and were sending embassies to Philip and Antiochus. They persuaded\r\nthe latter to assume a position of hostility to the Romans, promising\r\nhim that he should be king of both Greece and Italy. Roman interests\r\nwere so upset that they had no hope of overcoming Antiochus, but were\r\nsatisfied if they could preserve their former conquests. Antiochus was\r\nregarded as a mighty personage both in the light of his own power,\r\nthrough which he had performed distinguished exploits and above all\r\nhad subjugated Media, [Sidenote: B.C. 193 (_a.u._ 561)] and he loomed\r\nfar mightier still for having attached to his cause Ptolemy, king of\r\nEgypt, and Ariarathes, monarch of Cappadocia, as a kinsman by\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nAntiochus being so esteemed, the Romans as long as they were at war\r\nwith Philip were careful to court his favor, keeping up friendly\r\nrelations with him through envoys and sending him gifts. But when they\r\nhad vanquished their other enemy, they despised also this king whom\r\nthey had formerly feared. Antiochus himself crossed over into Thrace\r\nand gained control of many districts. [Sidenote: B.C. 192 (_a.u._\r\n562)] He helped colonize Lysimachia, which had been depopulated,\r\nintending to use it as a base. It was Philip and Nabis who had invited\r\nhis assistance. Hannibal, too, had been with him and had caused him to\r\nhope that he might sail to Carthage and from there to Italy, and\r\nfurther that he could subjugate the races along the Ionian Gulf and\r\nwith them set out against Rome. Twice before, indeed, Antiochus had\r\ncrossed into Europe and had reached Greece. This time he learned that\r\nPtolemy was dead, and deeming it all important that he should obtain\r\nthe sovereignty of Egypt he left his son Seleucus with a force at\r\nLysimachia and himself set out on the march. He found out, however,\r\nthat Ptolemy was alive, and so kept away from Egypt and made an\r\nattempt to sail to Cyprus. Baffled by a storm he returned home. The\r\nRomans and he both despatched envoys to each other submitting mutual\r\ncomplaints that they might get an excuse for the war and inspect\r\nconditions on each side betimes.\r\n\r\nHannibal had obtained the most important office at Carthage and in his\r\ntenure of it had offended the most powerful nobles and incurred their\r\nhatred. Malicious reports about him were conveyed to the Romans to\r\nthe effect that he was rousing the Carthaginians to revolt and was\r\nnegotiating with Antiochus. Learning that some men from Rome were at\r\nhand and fearing possible arrest he escaped from Carthage by night. He\r\ncame then to Antiochus and paved the way for his own restoration to\r\nhis native country and for war against the Romans by promising the\r\nking that he would secure to him the rulership of Greece and Italy.\r\nAll went well until Scipio Africanus joined them. Scipio had been sent\r\nto Libya as arbitrator between Masinissa and the Carthaginians, who\r\nwere at variance over some land boundaries, and had left their dispute\r\nstill hanging in the air that they might continue to quarrel and\r\nneither of them be angry at the Romans on account of a definite\r\ndecision. From there he crossed into Asia nominally as an envoy to\r\nAntiochus but in reality to smite both him and Hannibal with terror by\r\nhis appearance and accomplish what was for the advantage of the\r\nRomans. After his arrival Antiochus no longer bestowed a similar\r\ndegree of attention upon Hannibal. He suspected him of secret dealings\r\nwith Scipio, and found him burdensome besides, because everybody\r\nascribed every plan to Hannibal and all placed in him their hope for\r\nsuccess in the war. For these reasons, then, he became both jealous\r\nand afraid of Hannibal, dreading that he might change his demeanor,\r\nshould he get control of any power. So he neither supplied him with an\r\narmy nor sent one to Carthage; and he did not favor him very much\r\nwith audiences but made it a practice not to sanction any of his\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\nIX, 19.--The rumors about Antiochus occupied a large share of Rome's\r\nattention and caused the Romans no small degree of uneasiness. The\r\nname of Antiochus was in many mouths: some said that he already held\r\nthe whole of Greece, others talked to the effect that he was hastening\r\ntoward Italy. The Romans accordingly despatched envoys to Greece,\r\namong them Flamininus, who was on intimate terms with the people, in\r\norder to prevent them and Philip from creating any disturbance; and of\r\nthe praetors they sent Marcus Baebius to Apollonia, in case Antiochus\r\nshould undertake to cross over into Italy that way, and Aulus Atilius\r\nto attend to Nabis. The second of these had no work to do, for Nabis\r\nhad ere this perished, the victim of a plot on the part of the\r\nAEtolians, and Sparta had been captured by the Achaeans: Baebius and\r\nPhilip confirmed the loyalty of many portions of Thessaly. The\r\nMacedonian king was true to his agreement with the Romans principally\r\nfor the reason that Antiochus had attached some settlements belonging\r\nto him in Thrace.\r\n\r\nFlamininus went about Greece, and some he persuaded not to revolt,\r\nothers already revolted he won back, except the AEtolians and a few\r\ntowns elsewhere. The AEtolian league had bound itself to Antiochus and\r\nwas forming a union out of some states that were willing and others\r\nthat were unwilling. Antiochus in spite of the winter time hastened\r\nforward to fulfill the hopes of the AEtolians, and this explains why\r\nhe did not bring along a respectable force. With what he had, however,\r\nhe took Chalcis and gained control of the rest of Euboea. Finding\r\nsome Romans among the captives he released them all. Then he entered\r\nChalcis to spend the winter, [Sidenote: FRAG. 59^1] WITH THE RESULT\r\nTHAT HE HIMSELF AND HIS GENERALS AND HIS SOLDIERS HAD THEIR MENTAL\r\nENERGIES RUINED BEFOREHAND; FOR BY HIS GENERAL INDOLENCE AND HIS\r\nPASSION FOR A CERTAIN GIRL HE DRIFTED INTO LUXURIOUS LIVING AND AT THE\r\nSAME TIME RENDERED THE BEST UNFIT FOR WARFARE.\r\n\r\nThe people of Rome learning that he was in Greece and had captured\r\nChalcis took up the war in earnest. [Sidenote: B.C. 191 (_a.u._ 563)]\r\nOf the consuls they retained Scipio Nasica to guard Italy and sent\r\nManius Glabrio with a large army into Greece. Nasica conducted a war\r\nagainst the Boii, and Glabrio drove Antiochus out of Greece. He also\r\nwent to Thessaly and with the help of Baebius and Philip gained control\r\nof many of the towns there. He captured Philip of Megalopolis and sent\r\nhim to Rome, and drove Amynander out of his domain, which he then gave\r\nto the Macedonian ruler.\r\n\r\nAntiochus meanwhile was staying at Chalcis and keeping quiet.\r\nAfterward he entered Boeotia and at Thermopylae withstood the Romans\r\nwho came to meet him. Considering the fewness of his soldiers he\r\nthought it best to seek an ally in the natural advantages of his\r\nposition. And in order to avoid having himself such an experience as\r\nthe Greeks had met who were arrayed there against the Persian he sent\r\na division of the AEtolians up to the summit of the mountains to keep\r\nguard there. Glabrio cared little for the location and did not\r\npostpone a battle: however, he despatched his lieutenants Porcius Cato\r\nand Valerius Flaccus by night against the AEtolians on the summit and\r\nhimself engaged in conflict with Antiochus just about dawn. As long as\r\nhe fought on level ground he had the best of it, but when Antiochus\r\nfell back to a position higher up, he found himself inferior till Cato\r\narrived in the enemy's rear. Cato had come upon the AEtolians asleep\r\nand had killed most of them and scattered the rest; then he hurried\r\ndown and participated in the battle going on below. So they routed\r\nAntiochus and captured his camp. The king forthwith retired to\r\nChalcis, but learning that the consul was approaching went back\r\nunobserved to Asia.\r\n\r\nGlabrio at once occupied Boeotia and Euboea, and proceeded to\r\ndeliver assaults upon Heraclea, since the AEtolians were unwilling to\r\nyield to him. The lower city he captured by means of a siege and\r\nreceived the capitulation of those who had fled to the acropolis.\r\nAmong the prisoners taken at this time was found Democritus the\r\nAEtolian general, who had once refused alliance to Flamininus, and when\r\nthe latter asked for a decree that he might send it to Rome, had said:\r\n\"Don't worry. I will carry it there with my army and read it to you\r\nall on the banks of the Tiber.\"--Philip was engaged in besieging Lamia\r\nwhen Glabrio came against it and appropriated both victory and booty.\r\nThough the remainder of the AEtolians wanted to become reconciled,\r\nstill they made no truce because Antiochus sent them envoys and\r\nmoney; and they set themselves in readiness for war. Philip affected\r\nfriendliness toward the Romans, but his heart was with Antiochus.\r\nMeantime Glabrio was besieging Naupactus which belonged to the\r\nAEtolians, and Flamininus coming to them persuaded the inhabitants to\r\nmake peace, for he was well known to them. They as well as the Epirots\r\ndespatched envoys to Rome. Philip for sending a triumphal crown to\r\nCapitoline Jupiter received in return among other presents his son\r\nDemetrius, who was living at Rome a hostage. A truce was not made with\r\nthe AEtolians, for they would not submit to any curtailment of\r\nprivilege.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 190 (_a.u._ 564)] IX, 20.--The Romans set against\r\nAntiochus the Scipios, Africanus and his brother Lucius. They granted\r\nthe AEtolians a respite for the purpose of once more conducting an\r\nembassy to Rome regarding peace, and hurried on against Antiochus. On\r\nreaching Macedonia they secured allies from Philip and marched on to\r\nthe Hellespont. After crossing into Asia they occupied most of the\r\ncoast districts which had previously been occupied by the Romans who\r\nhad gone there first, as well as by Eumenes and the Rhodians; the\r\nlatter had also conquered Hannibal in the region of Pamphylia, as he\r\nwas taking some ships out from Phoenicia. Eumenes and his brother\r\nAttalus proceeded to injure the country of Antiochus, and cities kept\r\ncoming over, some under compulsion, some voluntarily, to the Romans,\r\nwith the ultimate result that Antiochus was obliged to abandon Europe\r\nentirely and to recall his son Seleucus from Lysimachia. When this\r\nson had accomplished the return journey, he sent him with troops\r\nagainst Pergamum. Inasmuch, however, as his investment of the town\r\nproved ineffectual and the Scipios soon reached his vicinity,\r\nAntiochus lost no time in concluding a truce with them; for he\r\nexpected to obtain terms since [Sidenote: FRAG. 59^2] HE HAD GOT\r\nPOSSESSION OF THE SON OF AFRICANUS AND WAS ACCORDING HIM THE KINDEST\r\nTREATMENT. AND FINALLY, THOUGH HE FAILED OF SECURING PEACE, HE\r\nRELEASED HIM WITHOUT RANSOM. The peace project, however, came to\r\nnothing, because Antiochus would not agree to accede to the Roman\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nStill, for a long time their attitude was marked by inaction. Finally\r\nthey fell to fighting again. The following may serve as a general\r\ndescription of the contest. Antiochus put the chariots in front, with\r\nthe elephants next, and behind these the slingers and the archers. But\r\nthe Romans anticipated the charge of the chariots by a charge of their\r\nown and with a great clamor they rushed straight at them and repulsed\r\nthem, so that most of these vehicles turned in the direction of the\r\nelephants. In their backward career they threw their own contingent\r\ninto confusion,--for their erratic course terrified and dispersed the\r\nmen marshaled close to them,--and a heavy rain which now came up\r\nrendered weak the detachment of archers and slingers. A heavy,\r\nall-enveloping mist succeeded, which was of no hindrance to the\r\nRomans, who had the upper hand and were fighting at close range; but\r\nin the case of their opponents, who were in dread and employed\r\ncavalry and archers for the most part, it made it out of the question\r\nto see which way to shoot their arrows and caused them to stumble over\r\none another, like men in the dark. Nevertheless Antiochus developed\r\nsufficient power, by means of his armored cavalry, to rout the\r\nantagonists directly confronting him and to advance in pursuit of them\r\nas far as their camp. Indeed, he would have taken it, had not Marcus\r\nAEmilius Lepidus, who was charged with guarding it, killed the first\r\nRomans that came in after they had refused to heed his exhortations to\r\ncheck their flight. As a result the rest of the party turned back and\r\nthe commander himself made a sortie with members of the garrison who\r\nwere free from the prevailing demoralization, and their united efforts\r\nrepulsed Antiochus. While this action was taking place, Zeuxis had\r\nassailed the ramparts in another quarter, had succeeded in getting\r\nwithin them, and continued to pillage until Lepidus became aware of it\r\nand came to the rescue of his own interests. At the same time Scipio\r\ncaptured the camp of Antiochus, wherein he found many human beings,\r\nmany horses, baggage animals, silver and gold coins, elephants, and a\r\nnumber of precious objects besides. Antiochus after this defeat at\r\nonce retired into Syria, and the Asiatic Greeks made common cause with\r\nthe Romans.\r\n\r\nAfter this, upon overtures made by Antiochus, an armistice was\r\narranged. Africanus was well disposed toward him for his son's sake,\r\nand the consul, too, did not want to leave the victory to be grasped\r\nby his successor, now approaching; consequently they laid upon\r\nAntiochus conditions no more severe than those they had originally\r\nset, before the battle. [Sidenote: B.C. 189 (_a.u._ 565)] Indeed,\r\nGnaeus Manlius who succeeded them in office was not pleased with the\r\nagreement reached, and he made additional demands upon the king,\r\nrequiring him besides to give hostages, one of whom should be his son\r\nAntiochus, and to deliver up all the deserters, among whom was\r\nHannibal. Antiochus reluctantly yielded obedience on all points: to\r\ngive up Hannibal, however, was out of his power, since that prince had\r\ntaken seasonable refuge with Prusias, king of Bithynia. On these terms\r\nAntiochus was able to send envoys to Rome and effect a cessation of\r\nhostilities. Lucius Scipio received praise for his victory, and it\r\ngave him the title of Asiaticus in the same way as his brother had\r\nbeen called Africanus for conquering Carthage, which had possessed the\r\nmost considerable power in Africa.\r\n\r\nThese brothers who had proved themselves men of such valor and as a\r\nresult of excellence had attained such a height of reputation were not\r\nlong afterward brought to court and handed over to the populace.\r\nLucius was condemned on the suspicion of his having appropriated no\r\ninconsiderable share of the spoil, and Africanus nominally for having\r\nmade the conditions lighter out of gratitude for kindness shown his\r\nson; (the true cause of his conviction was jealousy). [Sidenote: FRAG.\r\n60] THAT THEY COULD NOT JUSTLY BE CHARGED WITH WRONGDOING IS MADE\r\nPLAIN BOTH BY OTHER EVIDENCE AND MOST OF ALL BY THE FACT THAT WHEN THE\r\nPROPERTY OF ASIATICUS WAS CONFISCATED IT WAS FOUND TO CONSIST MERELY\r\nOF HIS ORIGINAL INHERITANCE, AND THAT THOUGH AFRICANUS RETIRED TO\r\nLITERNUM AND ABODE THERE TO THE END, NO ONE EVER AGAIN PASSED SENTENCE\r\nOF CONDEMNATION UPON HIM.\r\n\r\nManlius all this time was engaged in winning over Pisidia, Lycaonia,\r\nand Pamphylia, and a large district of Galatia in Asia. For there\r\nexists in that region too a race of Gauls which broke off from the\r\nEuropean stock. Years ago with their king, Brennus, at their head they\r\noverran Greece and Thrace, and crossing thence to Bithynia they\r\ndetached certain portions of Phrygia, Paphlagonia, Mysia adjacent to\r\nOlympus, and Cappadocia, and took up their residence in them; and they\r\nconstitute to-day a separate nation bearing the name of Gauls. This\r\npeople caused Manlius trouble, but he managed to overcome them too,\r\ncapturing their city Ancyra by assault and gaining control of the rest\r\nof the towns by capitulation. This effected, he set sail for home\r\nafter he had received a large price for peace from Ariarathes, king of\r\nCappadocia.\r\n\r\nIX, 21.--The AEtolians when they had sent ambassadors to Rome the\r\nsecond time in regard to peace themselves raised the standard of\r\nrebellion. Hence the Romans immediately dismissed the ambassadors and\r\nreferred the conduct of affairs in Greece to Marcus Fulvius. He set\r\nout first for the large city of Ambracia (it had once been the royal\r\nresidence of Pyrrhus and was now occupied by the AEtolians) and\r\nproceeded to besiege it. So the AEtolians held a conference with him\r\nabout peace, but finding him disinclined to a truce they sent a part\r\nof their army into Ambracia. The Romans undertook to capture the town\r\nby an underground passage and pushed their mine straight forward,\r\ntemporarily eluding the notice of the besieged party; but the latter\r\nbegan to suspect the true state of affairs when the excavated earth\r\nattained some dimensions. As they were not aware in what direction the\r\ntrench was being dug, they kept applying a bronze shield to the\r\nsurface of the ground all about the circuit of the walls. By means of\r\nthe resonance they found out the place and went to work in their turn\r\nto dig a tunnel from inside and approached the Romans, with whom they\r\nbattled in obscurity. Finally they devised the following sort of\r\ndefence. They filled a huge jar with feathers and put fire in it. To\r\nthis they attached a bronze cover that had a number of holes bored in\r\nit. Then, after carrying the jar into the mine and turning the mouth\r\nof it toward the enemy, they inserted a bellows in the bottom, and by\r\nblowing this bellows with vigor they caused a tremendous amount of\r\nunpleasant smoke, such as feathers would naturally create, to pour\r\nout, so that not one of the Romans could endure it. Hence the Romans\r\nin despair of succeeding made a truce and raised the siege. When they\r\nhad agreed to treat, the AEtolians also changed their course and\r\nsecured an armistice. Subsequently they obtained a peace from the\r\nPeople by the gift of considerable money and many hostages. Fulvius\r\ninduced Cephallenia to capitulate and reduced to order the\r\nPeloponnesus, which was in a state of factional turmoil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 187 (_a.u._ 567)] After a little, in the consulship of\r\nGaius Flaminius and AEmilius Lepidus, Antiochus died and his son\r\nSeleucus succeeded him. Much later, at the demise of Seleucus, the\r\nAntiochus who spent some time as a hostage in Rome became king.\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 183 (_a.u._ 571)] And Philip had courage enough to\r\nrevolt because he had been deprived of some towns in Thessaly and of\r\nAEnus and Maronea besides, but he was unable to do so on account of his\r\nage and what had happened to his sons.--Some Gauls crossed the Alps\r\nand desired to found a city to the south of the mountains. Marcus\r\nMarcellus took away their arms and everything that they had brought:\r\nthe Romans in the capital, however, upon receiving an embassy from\r\nthem restored everything on condition that they should at once retire.\r\n\r\nThese years also saw the death of Hannibal. Envoys had been sent from\r\nRome to Prusias, monarch of Bithynia, and a part of their errand was\r\nto make him give up Hannibal, who was at his court. The Carthaginian\r\nhad advance information of the facts and being unable to escape\r\ncommitted suicide. [Sidenote: cp. FRAG. 64.] AN ORACLE HAD ONCE\r\nANNOUNCED TO HIM THAT HE SHOULD DIE IN THE LAND OF LIBYSSA, AND HE WAS\r\nEXPECTING TO DIE IN LIBYA, HIS NATIVE COUNTRY, BUT, AS IT HAPPENED,\r\nHIS DEMISE OCCURRED WHILE HE CHANCED TO BE STAYING IN A CERTAIN PLACE\r\nCALLED LIBYSSA. Scipio Africanus also died at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 20, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 179 (_a.u._ 575)] IX, 22.--Philip, king of Macedonia,\r\nhad put to death his son Demetrius and was about to slay his other son\r\nPerseus, when death overtook him. Because Demetrius had gained the\r\naffection of the Roman people through his sojourn as hostage and\r\nbecause he himself and the rest of the Macedonian people hoped that he\r\nwould secure the kingdom after Philip was done with it, Perseus, who\r\nwas his elder, became jealous of him and falsely reported him to be\r\nplotting against his father. Thus Demetrius was forced to drink poison\r\nand perished. Philip not long after ascertained the truth and desired\r\nto take measures against Perseus; he did not, however, possess\r\nsufficient strength and death overtook him. Perseus succeeded to the\r\nkingdom. The Romans confirmed his claims to it and renewed the compact\r\nof friendship enjoyed by his father.\r\n\r\nIn the period immediately following some events of importance took\r\nplace, yet they were not of so vital a character that one should deem\r\nthem worthy of record. Still later Perseus put himself in the position\r\nof an enemy to the Romans, and in order to delay actual warfare until\r\nhe should reach a state of preparation he sent envoys to Rome\r\npresumably to make a defence on the charges which were being pressed\r\nagainst him. These messengers the Romans would not receive within the\r\nwall, but they transacted business with them in the space before the\r\ncity; and no other answer was vouchsafed them than that they would\r\nsend a consul with whom he might confer on whatever topics he pleased.\r\nThey also caused them to depart the same day, having given them guides\r\nto prevent their associating with anybody. And Perseus was forbidden\r\nin the future to set foot on the soil of Italy.\r\n\r\nThe Romans next sent out Gnaeus Sicinius, a praetor, with a small force\r\n(they had not yet made ready their greater armament) and Perseus made\r\na tentative invasion of Thessaly in which he won over the greater part\r\nof that country. [Sidenote: B.C. 171 (_a.u._ 583)] When spring opened\r\nthey sent Licinius Crassus against him as well as a praetor, Gaius\r\nLucretius, in charge of the fleet. The latter first encountered\r\nPerseus near Larissa and was worsted in a cavalry skirmish: later,\r\nthough, he got the best of him and Perseus accordingly retreated into\r\nMacedonia. As for Crassus, he assailed the Greek cities which were\r\nheld in subjection by Philip and was repulsed from the majority of\r\nthem, although he did get possession of a few. Some he razed to the\r\nground and sold the captives. When the inhabitants of Rome learned\r\nthese details, they became indignant and later they imposed a money\r\nfine on Crassus, liberated the captured cities, and bought back from\r\nthe purchasers such of their inhabitants as had been sold and were\r\nthen found in Italy.\r\n\r\nSo fared the Romans in these undertakings, but in the war against\r\nPerseus as a whole they suffered many great reverses and their\r\nfortunes at many points were at a low ebb. Perseus occupied the\r\ngreater part of Epirus and Thessaly, having gathered a large body of\r\ntroops. As a measure of defence against the Romans' elephants he had\r\ntrained a phalanx of heavy-armed warriors whose shields and helmets he\r\nhad taken care should be studded with sharp iron nails. Also, in order\r\nto make sure that the beasts should not prove a source of terror to\r\nthe horses he constructed images of elephants that were smeared with\r\nsome kind of ointment to give them a fearful odor and were frightful\r\nboth to see and to hear (for a mechanical device enabled them to emit\r\na roar resembling thunder); and he kept continually leading the horses\r\nup to these representations until they took courage. Perseus, then, as\r\na result of all this had acquired great confidence and entertained\r\nhope that he might surpass Alexander in glory and in the size of his\r\ndomain; the people of Rome [Sidenote: B.C. 169 (_a.u._ 585)] when they\r\nlearned this sent out with speed Marcius Philippus, who was consul.\r\nHe, on reaching the camp in Thessaly, drilled the Romans and the\r\nallies so that Perseus, becoming afraid, remained quietly in Dium of\r\nMacedonia and close to Tempe, and continued to keep watch of the pass.\r\nPhilippus, encouraged by this behavior of his, crossed the mountain\r\nrange in the center and occupied some possessions of Perseus. But as\r\nhe was progressing toward Pydna he fell short of provisions and turned\r\nback to Thessaly. Perseus gained boldness anew, recovered the places\r\nthat Philippus had occupied, and with his fleet damaged the Romans at\r\nnumerous points. He also secured allies [Sidenote: FRAG. 65^1] AND\r\nHOPED TO EJECT THE ROMANS FROM GREECE ALTOGETHER, BUT THROUGH HIS\r\nEXCESSIVE AND INOPPORTUNE PARSIMONY AND THE CONSEQUENT CONTEMPT OF HIS\r\nALLIES HE BECAME WEAK ONCE MORE. SO SOON AS ROMAN INFLUENCE WAS\r\nDECLINING SLIGHTLY AND HIS OWN WAS INCREASING, HE WAS FILLED WITH\r\nSCORN AND THOUGHT HE HAD NO FURTHER NEED OF HIS ALLIES, AND WOULD NOT\r\nGIVE THEM THE MONEY WHICH HE HAD OFFERED. THE ZEAL OF SOME ACCORDINGLY\r\nBECAME BLUNTED AND OTHERS ABANDONED HIM ENTIRELY, WHEREUPON HE WAS SO\r\nOVERWHELMED BY DESPAIR AS ACTUALLY TO SUE FOR PEACE. AND HE WOULD HAVE\r\nOBTAINED IT THROUGH EUMENES BUT FOR THE PRESENCE OF RHODIANS ALSO IN\r\nTHE EMBASSY. THEY, BY ADOPTING A HAUGHTY TONE WITH THE ROMANS,\r\nPREVENTED HIM FROM OBTAINING PEACE.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 168 (_a.u._ 586)] IX, 23.--At this point the war waged\r\nagainst him was entrusted to AEmilius Paulus, now for the second time\r\nconsul. He rapidly traversed the distance separating him from Thessaly\r\nand having first set the affairs of the soldiers in order forced his\r\nway through Tempe, which was being guarded by only a few men, and\r\nmarched against Perseus. The latter had ere this erected breastworks\r\nalong the river Elpeus which intervened, had occupied and rendered\r\nimpassable by means of stone walls and palisades and buildings all the\r\nground between Olympus and the sea, and was encouraged by the lack of\r\nwater in the place. Yet even so the consul sought to effect a passage\r\nand found a means of overcoming the prevailing drought. By piercing\r\nthe sand bed at the foot of Olympus he found water that was delicious\r\nas well as drinkable.--Meanwhile envoys of the Rhodians reached him\r\nanimated by the same insolence which they had displayed on their\r\nformer embassy to Rome. He would make no statement to them beyond\r\nsaying that he would return an answer in a few days, and dismissed\r\nthem.--Since he could accomplish nothing by direct assault, but\r\nlearned that the mountains were traversable here and there, he sent a\r\nportion of his army toward that pass across them which was the more\r\ndifficult of approach, to seize opportune points along the route (on\r\naccount of its difficulty of access it had an extremely small guard);\r\nand he himself with the remainder of his army attacked Perseus that\r\nthe latter might not entertain any suspicion which might lead to his\r\nguarding the mountains with especial care. After this, when the\r\nheights had been occupied, he set out by night for the mountains and\r\nby passing unnoticed at some points and employing force at others he\r\ncrossed them. Perseus on learning it became afraid that his enemy\r\nmight assail him from the rear or even get control of Pydna before he\r\ncould (for the Roman fleet was simultaneously sailing along the\r\ncoast), and he abandoned his fortification near the river and\r\nhastening to Pydna encamped in front of the town. Paulus, too, came\r\nthere, but instead of immediately beginning an engagement they delayed\r\nfor a number of days. Paulus had found out prior to the event that the\r\nmoon was about to suffer an eclipse, and after collecting his army on\r\nthe evening when the eclipse was due to occur gave the men notice of\r\nwhat would happen and warned them not to let it disturb them at all.\r\nSo the Romans on beholding the eclipse looked for no evil to come from\r\nit, but it made an impression of terror upon the Macedonians and they\r\nthought that the prodigy had a bearing on the cause of Perseus. While\r\neach side was in this frame of mind an entirely accidental occurrence\r\nthe next day threw them into a fierce conflict and put an end to the\r\nwar. One of the Roman pack-animals had fallen into the water from\r\nwhich a supply was being drawn, and the Macedonians laid hold of him,\r\nwhile the water-carriers in turn tightened their grasp. At first they\r\nfought by themselves; then the remainder of the forces gradually\r\nissued from the respective camps to the assistance of their own men\r\nand everybody on both sides became engaged. A disordered but sharp\r\nconflict ensued in which the Romans were victorious and pursuing the\r\nMacedonians as far as the sea slaughtered numbers of them by their own\r\nefforts and allowed the fleet, which was drawing inshore, to slay\r\nnumbers more. Not one of them would have been left alive but for the\r\ntimely succor of night (for the battle had raged during the late\r\nafternoon).\r\n\r\nPerseus consequently made his escape to Amphipolis, where he intended\r\nto rally the survivors and reorganize the campaign; but as nobody came\r\nto him save Cretan mercenaries and he learned that Pydna and other\r\ncities had espoused the Roman cause, he removed thence, and after\r\nputting aboard some vessels all the money that he was carrying he\r\nsailed away by night to Samothrace. Before long he ascertained that\r\nOctavius was approaching at the head of his fleet and that Paulus was\r\nin Amphipolis; so he sent him a letter requesting permission to confer\r\nabout terms. Since, however, he described himself in the letter as\r\n\"king\", he did not get any answer. Subsequently he despatched a letter\r\nwithout any such appellation contained in it and was granted a\r\nconference to consider the question of peace, but the victor declared\r\nthat he would not sanction any conditions that did not include\r\nPerseus's surrender of his person and all his possessions to the\r\nRomans' keeping. Hence they failed to come to an agreement. [Sidenote:\r\nFRAG. 65^3] AFTER THIS A DEMAND WAS MADE UPON PERSEUS BY THE ROMANS\r\nFOR THE SURRENDER OF ONE EVANDER, A CRETAN, WHO HAD ASSISTED HIM IN\r\nMANY SCHEMES AGAINST THEM AND WAS MOST FAITHFUL TO HIM. THE PRINCE,\r\nFEARING THAT HE MIGHT DECLARE ALL THE INTRIGUES TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN\r\nPRIVY, DID NOT DELIVER HIM BUT SECRETLY SLEW HIM AND HAD IT RUMORED\r\nTHAT THE MAN HAD PERISHED BY HIS OWN HAND. THEN THE ASSOCIATES OF\r\nPERSEUS, FEARING HIS TREACHERY (for they were not ignorant of what had\r\noccurred), BEGAN TO DESERT HIS STANDARD. Perseus, then, being afraid\r\nthat he should be delivered up to the Romans tried one night to escape\r\nby flight and might have taken himself away unobserved to Cotys, a\r\nThracian potentate, but for the fact that the Cretans abandoned him.\r\nThey placed the money in boats and weighed anchor for home. So he\r\nremained there for some days with Philip, one of his sons, hidden from\r\nsight, but on ascertaining that the rest of his children and his\r\nretinue had fallen into the hands of Octavius [Sidenote: FRAG. 65^4]\r\nHE ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE FOUND. UPON HIS BEING BROUGHT TO AMPHIPOLIS\r\nPAULUS DID HIM NO INJURY, BUT BOTH ENTERTAINED HIM AND HAD HIM SIT AT\r\nHIS TABLE, KEEPING HIM, LIKEWISE, ALTHOUGH A PRISONER, UNCONFINED, AND\r\nSHOWING HIM COURTESY. After this Paulus returned through Epirus to\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nIX, 24.--About the same time Lucius Anicius, a praetor sent to conduct\r\noperations against Gentius, both conquered those who withstood him and\r\npursued Gentius, when he fled, to Scodra (where his palace was\r\nlocated) and shut him up there. The place was built on a spur of the\r\nmountain and had deep ravines containing boiling torrents winding\r\nabout it, besides being girt by a steadfast wall; and so the Roman\r\ncommander's siege of it would have come to naught, if Gentius\r\npresuming greatly upon his own power had not voluntarily advanced to\r\nbattle. This act gave the control of his entire domain to Anicius, who\r\nthen proceeded, before Paulus could arrive, to Epirus and tamed the\r\nquarrelsome pride of that district as well.\r\n\r\nThe Romans of the capital by some vague report heard of the victory of\r\nPaulus on the fourth day after the battle, but they placed no sure\r\nconfidence in it. Then letters were brought from Paulus regarding his\r\nsuccess and they were mightily pleased and plumed themselves not\r\nmerely upon having vanquished Perseus and acquired Macedonia but upon\r\nhaving beaten the renowned Philip of old time and Alexander himself\r\ntogether with all that empire which he had held. When Paulus reached\r\nRome many decrees in his honor were passed and the celebration of his\r\ntriumph proved a most brilliant event. He had in his procession all\r\nthe booty which he had captured, and he had also Bithys, the son of\r\nCotys, besides Perseus and his wife and three children altogether in\r\nthe garb of captives. Fearing that Heaven might wax envious of the\r\nRomans on account of their excess of good fortune he prayed, as\r\nCamillus had done before, that no ill to the State might result from\r\nit all but rather to him if it should be unavoidable: and, indeed, he\r\nlost two sons, one a little before the celebration and the other\r\nduring the triumphal festival itself. [Sidenote: FRAG. 66] HE WAS NOT\r\nONLY GOOD AT GENERALSHIP, BUT HE LOOKED DOWN UPON MONEY. OF THIS THE\r\nFOLLOWING IS A PROOF. THOUGH HE HAD AT THAT TIME ENTERED FOR A SECOND\r\nTERM UPON THE CONSULSHIP AND HAD GAINED POSSESSION OF UNTOLD SPOILS,\r\nHE CONTINUED TO LIVE IN SO GREAT INDIGENCE THAT WHEN HE DIED THE DOWRY\r\nWAS WITH DIFFICULTY PAID BACK TO HIS WIFE.\r\n\r\nOf the captives Bithys was returned to his father without ransom, but\r\nPerseus with his children and attendants was settled in Alba. There he\r\nendured so long as he still hoped to recover his sovereignty, but when\r\nhe despaired of doing so he despatched himself. His son Philip and his\r\ndaughter also died shortly after: only the youngest son survived for a\r\ntime and served in the capacity of under-secretary to the magistrates\r\nof Alba. Thus Perseus, who boasted of tracing his descent through\r\ntwenty kings and often had Philip and still oftener Alexander in his\r\nmouth, lost his kingdom, became a captive, and marched in the\r\nprocession of triumph wearing chains as well as his diadem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 67^1] THE RHODIANS, WHO IN THEIR EARLIER DEALINGS\r\nWITH THE ROMANS DISPLAYED SELF-ESTEEM, NOW BEGGED THE LATTER NOT TO\r\nBEAR ILL-WILL TOWARD THEM: [Sidenote: FRAG. 67^2] AND WHEREAS THEY HAD\r\nPREVIOUSLY REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE TITLE OF ROMAN ALLIES, THEY WERE NOW\r\nESPECIALLY ANXIOUS TO SECURE IT; and they obtained the object of their\r\neagerness, but only after long delay. The Romans harbored resentment\r\nagainst the Cretans, too, but in response to a number of embassies on\r\nthe part of this nation they eventually relaxed their anger. Their\r\nbehavior was similar [Sidenote: FRAG. 68] IN THE CASE OF PRUSIAS AND\r\nEUMENES. THE FORMER CAME PERSONALLY TO THE CITY AND ENTERED THE\r\nSENATE-HOUSE, COVERED THE THRESHOLD WITH KISSES, AND WORSHIPPED THE\r\nSENATORS; THUS HE OBTAINED PITY and was held guiltless: Eumenes\r\nthrough Attalus his brother secured himself against any continuation\r\nof malice on their part.\r\n\r\nAt this time, too, the affairs of Cappadocia were settled in the\r\nfollowing manner. The monarch of that country, Ariarathes, had a\r\nlegitimate son Ariarathes. But since for a long time before she had\r\nthis son his wife had failed to conceive, she had adopted a child whom\r\nshe called Orophernes. When the true son was later born the position\r\nof the other was detected and he was banished. Naturally after the\r\ndeath of Ariarathes he headed an uprising against his brother. Eumenes\r\nallied himself with Ariarathes, and Demetrius the king of Syria with\r\nOrophernes. Ariarathes after sustaining a defeat found an asylum with\r\nthe Romans and was appointed by them to share the kingdom with\r\nOrophernes. But the fact that Ariarathes had been termed \"friend and\r\nally\" by the Romans enabled him subsequently to make the entire domain\r\nhis own. Attalus soon succeeded Eumenes (who died) and drove\r\nOrophernes and Demetrius out of Cappadocia altogether.\r\n\r\nIX, 25.--Ptolemy, ruler of Egypt, passed away leaving two sons and one\r\ndaughter. When the brothers began to quarrel with each other about the\r\nsupreme office, Antiochus the son of Antiochus the Great sheltered the\r\nyounger, who had been driven out, in order that under the pretext of\r\ndefending him he might interfere in Egyptian politics. In a campaign\r\ndirected against Egypt he conquered the greater part of the country\r\nand spent some time in besieging Alexandria. As the unsubdued sought\r\nrefuge with the Romans, Popilius was sent to Antiochus and bade him\r\nkeep his hands off Egypt; for the brothers, comprehending the designs\r\nof Antiochus, had become reconciled. When the latter was for putting\r\noff his reply, Popilius drew a circle about him with his staff and\r\ndemanded that he deliberate and answer standing where he was.\r\nAntiochus then in fear raised the siege. The Ptolemies (such was the\r\nname of both princes) on being relieved of foreign dread fell into\r\nrenewed disputing. Then they were reconciled again by the Romans on\r\nthe condition that the elder should have Egypt and Cyprus, and the\r\nother one the country about Cyrene, which was likewise part of Egypt\r\nat that time. The younger one was vexed at having the inferior portion\r\nand came to Rome where he secured from the government a grant of\r\nCyprus in addition. Then the elder once more effected an arrangement\r\nwith the younger son by giving him some cities in exchange for Cyprus\r\nand being rated to contribute money and grain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 164 (_a.u._ 590)] Antiochus subsequently died, leaving\r\nthe kingdom to a child of the same name whom the Romans confirmed in\r\npossession of it and sent three men (with sufficient show of reason,\r\nfor he was a minor) to act as his guardians. They on finding elephants\r\nand triremes contrary to the compact ordered the elephants all to be\r\nslain and administered everything else in the interest of Rome.\r\nTherefore Lysias, who had been entrusted with the surveillance of the\r\nking, incited the populace to cast out the Romans and also kill\r\nGaius[39] Octavius. When these plans had been carried out Lysias\r\nstraightway despatched envoys to Rome to offer a defence for what had\r\nbeen done. Demetrius the son of Seleucus son of Antiochus, who was\r\nstaying in Rome as a hostage at the time of his father's death and had\r\nbeen deprived of the kingdom by his uncle Antiochus, asked for his\r\nancestral domain when he learned of the death of Antiochus, but the\r\nRomans would neither help him to get it nor permit him to set out from\r\nRome. In spite of his dissatisfaction he remained quiet. But when the\r\naffair of Lysias came up, he no longer delayed but escaped by flight\r\nand sent a message to the senate from Lycia saying that his objective\r\nwas not his _cousin_ Antiochus (the children of brothers were so\r\ntermed by the ancients) but Lysias, and his purpose was to avenge\r\nOctavius. Hastening to Tripolis in Syria he won over this town also,\r\npretending that he had been sent out by the Romans to take charge of\r\nthe kingdom. No one at this time had any idea of his secret flight,\r\nand so after conquering Apamea and gathering a body of troops he\r\nmarched to Antioch. There he destroyed Lysias and the boy, who came to\r\nmeet him in the guise of friends (through fear of the Romans they had\r\noffered no opposition), [Sidenote: B.C. 162 (_a.u._ 592)] and he\r\nrecovered the kingdom, whereupon he forwarded to Rome a crown and the\r\nassassins of Octavius. The citizens, being enraged at him, would\r\naccept neither the one nor the other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: This name is erroneously written by Zonaras for Gnaeus.\r\n(Cp. Polybius 28, 3, 2; 31, 12 (also 13, 19, and 20); 32, 4 to 7.)]\r\n\r\nNext the Romans made a campaign against the Dalmatians. This race\r\nconsists of Illyrians who dwell along the Ionian Gulf, some of whom\r\nthe Greeks used to call Taulantii, and part of them are close to\r\nDyrrachium. The cause of the war was that they had been abusing some\r\nof their neighbors who were in a league of friendship with the Romans,\r\nand when the Romans joined an embassy in their behalf the Dalmatians\r\nreturned an answer that was not respectful, and even arrested and\r\nkilled the envoys of the other nations. [Sidenote: B.C. 155 (_a.u._\r\n599)] Scipio Nasica subdued this race in a campaign against them. He\r\ncaptured their towns and several times sold the captives.--Other\r\nevents, too, took place in those days,--not, however, of a kind to\r\ndeserve mention or historical record.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 21, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 153 (_a.u._ 601)] IX, 26.--The rattling of dice in the\r\nbox of Circumstance now announced the final cast in the struggle with\r\nCarthage,--the third of the series. The Carthaginians could not endure\r\ntheir subordinate position, but contrary to the treaty were setting\r\ntheir fleet in readiness and making alliances as measures of\r\npreparation for war with the Nomads: [Sidenote: B.C. 152 (_a.u._ 602)]\r\nand the Romans, having settled other questions to their own\r\nsatisfaction, did not remain at rest, but by the mouth of Scipio\r\nNasica their commissioner they charged their rivals with this breach\r\nof faith and ordered them to disband their armament. The Carthaginians\r\nfound fault with Masinissa and on account of the war with him declined\r\nto obey the command. The Romans then arranged terms for them with\r\nMasinissa and prevailed upon him to retire from some territory in\r\ntheir favor. [Sidenote: B.C. 150 (_a.u._ 604)] Since they showed\r\nthemselves no more tractable than before, the Romans waited a bit, and\r\nas soon as information was received that the Carthaginians had been\r\nworsted in a great battle by Masinissa they voted for war against\r\nthem. The Carthaginians, who were feeling the effects of their defeat,\r\nbecame frightened on learning this and sent envoys to Rome to secure\r\nan alliance; for other neighboring tribes were also beginning to\r\nattack them. They feigned a readiness to yield to the Romans on all\r\npoints, and their very intention of not remaining true to their\r\nagreements rendered them all the more ready to promise anything.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 149 (_a.u._ 605)] When the senate called a meeting to\r\nconsider the matter, Scipio Nasica advised receiving the Carthaginian\r\nembassy and making a truce with them, but Marcus Cato declared that no\r\ntruce ought to be arranged nor the decree of war rescinded. The\r\nsenators accepted the supplication of the envoys, promised to grant\r\nthem a truce, and asked for hostages as an earnest of these\r\nconditions. These hostages were sent to Sicily and Lucius Marcius and\r\nMarcus Manilius went there, took charge of them, and sent them on to\r\nRome. They themselves made haste to occupy Africa. After encamping\r\nthey summoned the magistrates of Carthage to appear before them. When\r\nthese officials arrived they did not unmask all their demands at once,\r\nfor they feared that if the Carthaginians understood them in season\r\nthey would plunge into war with resources unimpaired. So first they\r\nasked for and received grain, next the triremes, and after that the\r\nengines; and then they demanded the arms besides. They secured the\r\nentire visible supply (but the Carthaginians had a great deal of other\r\nequipment safely hidden) and at length ordered them to raze their city\r\nand to build in its place an unwalled town inland, eighty stades\r\ndistant from the sea. At that the Carthaginians were dissolved in\r\ntears, acknowledged that they were trapped, and bewailed their fate,\r\nbegging the consuls not to compel them to act as the assassins of\r\ntheir country. They soon found that they could accomplish nothing and\r\nhad to face the repeated command either to execute the order or to\r\ncast the die of war. Many of the people then remained there on the\r\nRoman side, tacitly admitting their success: the remainder withdrew,\r\nand after killing some of their rulers for not having chosen war in\r\nthe first place and after murdering such Romans as were discovered\r\nwithin the fortification they turned their attention to war. Under\r\nthese circumstances they liberated all the slaves, restored the\r\nexiles, chose Hasdrubal once more as leader, and made ready arms,\r\nengines, and triremes. With war at their doors and the danger of\r\nslavery confronting them they prepared in the briefest possible time\r\neverything that they needed. They spared nothing, but melted down the\r\nstatues for the sake of the bronze in them and used the hair of their\r\nwomen for ropes. The consuls at first, thinking them unarmed, expected\r\nto overcome them speedily and merely prepared ladders, with which they\r\nexpected to scale the wall at once. As the assault showed their\r\nenemies to be armed and they saw that they possessed means for a\r\nsiege, the Romans, before approaching close to the city again, devoted\r\nthemselves to the manufacture of engines. The construction of these\r\nmachines was fraught with danger, since Hasdrubal set ambuscades for\r\nthose who were gathering the wood and annoyed them considerably, but\r\nin time they were able to assail the town. Now Manilius in his assault\r\nfrom the land side could not injure the Carthaginians at all, but\r\nMarcius, while delivering an attack from marshy ground on the side\r\nwhere the sea was, managed to shake down a part of the wall, though he\r\ncould not get inside. The Carthaginians repulsed those who attempted\r\nto force their way in, and at night issued through the ruins to slay\r\nnumerous men and burn up a very large number of engines. Hasdrubal and\r\nthe cavalry, however, did not allow them to scatter over any\r\nconsiderable territory and Masinissa lent them no aid. He had not been\r\ninvited at the opening of the war, and, though he had promised\r\nHasdrubal that he would fight now, they gave him no opportunity of\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nIX, 27.--The consuls in view of the outcome of their attempts and\r\nbecause their fleet had been damaged by its stay in the lake raised\r\nthe siege. Marcius endeavored to achieve some advantage by sea or at\r\nleast to injure the coast districts, but not accomplishing anything he\r\nsailed for home, then turned back and subdued AEgimurus: and Manilius\r\nstarted for the interior, but upon sustaining injuries at the hands of\r\nHimilco, commander of the Carthaginian cavalry, whom they called also\r\nPhameas, he returned to Carthage. There, while the outside forces of\r\nHasdrubal troubled him, the people in the city harassed him by\r\nexcursions both night and day. In fact, the Carthaginians came to\r\ndespise him and advanced as far as the Roman camp, but being for the\r\nmost part unarmed they lost a number of men and shut themselves up in\r\ntheir fortifications again. Manilius was particularly anxious to get\r\ninto close quarters with Hasdrubal, thinking that, if he could\r\nvanquish him, he should find it easier to wage war upon the remainder.\r\nHis wish to get into close quarters with him was eventually realized.\r\nHe followed Hasdrubal to a small fort whither the latter was retiring,\r\nand before he knew it got into a narrow passage over rough ground and\r\nthere suffered a tremendous reverse. He would have been utterly\r\ndestroyed, had he not found a most valuable helper in the person of\r\nScipio the descendant of Africanus, [Sidenote: FRAG. 69] WHO EXCELLED\r\nIN APPREHENDING AND DEVISING BEFOREHAND THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS\r\nMOVEMENTS, BUT EXCELLED ALSO IN EXECUTING THEM. IN BODILY FRAME HE WAS\r\nSTRONG; HE WAS AMIABLE, TOO, AND MODERATE; AND FOR THESE REASONS HE\r\nESCAPED ENVY. HE CHOSE TO MAKE HIMSELF LIKE TO HIS INFERIORS, NOT\r\nBETTER THAN HIS EQUALS (he served as military tribune), AND WEAKER\r\nTHAN GREATER MEN. Manilius both reported what Scipio had done and sent\r\na letter to the people of Rome concealing nothing, but including among\r\nother matters an account of the proceedings of Masinissa and Phameas.\r\nThese were as follows.\r\n\r\nMasinissa on his death-bed was at a loss to know how he should dispose\r\nof his kingdom, his dilemma being due to the number of his sons and\r\nthe variety of their family ties on their mothers' side. Therefore he\r\nsent for Scipio to advise him, and the consul let Scipio go. But the\r\ndemise of Masinissa occurred before Scipio arrived, and he gave his\r\nring to his son Micipsa and delivered and committed all the other\r\ninterests pertaining to his kingdom to Scipio, so soon as the latter\r\nshould arrive. Scipio being aware of the preferences of Masinissa's\r\nsons assigned the kingdom to no one of them singly; but whereas there\r\nwere three most distinguished, the eldest Micipsa, the youngest\r\nGulussa, and intermediate in age Mastanabal, he appointed these to\r\nhave charge of affairs, though separately. To the eldest, who was\r\nversed in business and fond of wealth, he entrusted the fiscal\r\nadministration, to the second son, who possessed the critical faculty,\r\nhe granted the right to decide disputes, and to Gulussa, who chanced\r\nto be of a warlike temperament, he delivered the troops. They had also\r\nnumerous brothers on whom he bestowed certain cities and districts. He\r\ntook Gulussa along with him and introduced him to the consul.\r\n\r\nNow at the beginning of spring they made a campaign against the allies\r\nof the Carthaginians and brought many of them to terms forcibly while\r\ninducing many others to capitulate. Scipio was especially active in\r\nthe work. [Sidenote: FRAG. 70] WHEN PHAMEAS, DESPAIRING OF\r\nCARTHAGINIAN SUCCESS, went over to the Romans and held a conference\r\nwith Scipio, then they all set out against Hasdrubal. For several days\r\nthey assailed his fortress, but as necessaries failed them they\r\nretired in good order. During the siege Phameas had attacked them and\r\nmade a show of fighting, and in the progress of the action he had\r\ndeserted together with some of the cavalry. Then Manilius went to\r\nUtica and remained quiet, while Scipio took Phameas back to Rome,\r\nwhere he himself received commendation and Phameas was honored to the\r\nextent of being allowed to sit with the senate in the senate-house.\r\n\r\nIX, 28.--It was at this time, too, that the episode occurred in which\r\nPrusias figured. The latter being old and of an irritable disposition\r\nbecame possessed by a fear that the Bithynians would expel him from\r\nhis kingdom, choosing in his stead his son Nicomedes. So on some\r\npretext he sent his son to Rome, with orders to make that his home.\r\nBut since he plotted against the younger man even during the sojourn\r\nin Rome and labored to kill him, some Bithynians made visits to Rome,\r\ntook Nicomedes away secretly and conveyed him to Bithynia, and after\r\nslaying the old man designated him king. This act vexed the Romans,\r\nbut did not incense them to the point of war.\r\n\r\nA certain Andriscus, who was a native of Atramyttium and resembled\r\nPerseus in appearance, caused a wide area of Macedonia to revolt by\r\npretending to be his son and calling himself Philip. First he went to\r\nMacedonia and tried to upheave the country, but as no one would yield\r\nhim allegiance he took his way to Demetrius in Syria to obtain from\r\nhim the aid which relationship might afford. Demetrius arrested him\r\nand sent him to Rome, where he met with general contempt, both because\r\nhe stood convicted of not being the son of Perseus and because he had\r\nno other qualities that were worthy of attention. On being released he\r\ngathered a band of revolutionists, drew after him a number of cities,\r\nand finally, assuming the kingly garb and mustering an army, he\r\nreached Thrace. There he added to his army numbers of the independent\r\nlands as well as numbers of princes who disliked the Romans, invaded\r\nMacedonia (which he occupied), and setting out for Thessaly made not a\r\nlittle of that territory his own.\r\n\r\nThe Romans at first scorned Andriscus and then they sent Scipio Nasica\r\nto effect some peaceful settlement in those parts. On reaching Greece\r\nand ascertaining what had occurred he despatched a letter to the\r\nRomans explaining the case; then after collecting troops from allies\r\nthere he gave attention to the business in hand and advanced as far\r\nas Macedonia. The people of Rome when informed of the doings of\r\nAndriscus sent an army and Publius Juventius, a praetor. Juventius had\r\njust reached the vicinity of Macedonia, when Andriscus gave battle,\r\nkilled the praetor, and would have annihilated his entire force but for\r\nits withdrawal by night. Next he invaded Thessaly, damaged a very\r\ngreat extent of it, and ranged Thracian interests on his side.\r\nConsequently the people of Rome once more despatched a praetor, Quintus\r\nCaecilius Metellus, with a strong body of troops: he proceeded to\r\nMacedonia and enjoyed the assistance of the fleet of Attalus. The\r\nfleet inspired Andriscus with some alarm for the coast districts so\r\nthat he did not venture to advance farther but moved up to a point\r\nslightly beyond Pydna. There he had the best of it in a cavalry\r\nencounter but out of fear of the infantry turned back. His elation was\r\nsuch that he divided his army into two sections, and with one remained\r\non the watch where he was, while he sent the other to ravage Thessaly.\r\nMetellus in derision of the forces confronting him joined battle, and\r\nby overpowering those with whom he first came into conflict he got\r\ncontrol of the remainder with greater ease; for they made terms with\r\nhim readily, inasmuch as they had erred. Andriscus fled to Thrace and\r\nafter assembling a body of fighters gave battle to Metellus as the\r\nlatter was advancing on his track. His vanguard, however, was routed\r\nfirst; then his contingent of allies was scattered; and Andriscus\r\nhimself was betrayed by Byzes, a Thracian prince, and executed.\r\n\r\nOne Alexander, that also declared himself to be a son of Perseus and\r\ncollected a band of warriors, had occupied the country round about the\r\nriver which is called the Mestus:[40] but he now took to flight, and\r\nMetellus chased him as far as Dardania.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Presumably an error for the _Nestus_, a well-known\r\nstream.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 148 (_a.u._ 606)] IX, 29.--The Romans put Piso the\r\nconsul in the field against the Carthaginians. Piso did not try\r\nconclusions with Carthage and Hasdrubal, but devoted himself to the\r\ncoast cities. He was repulsed from Aspis, captured and razed Neapolis,\r\nand in his expedition against the town of Hippo merely used up time\r\nwithout accomplishing anything. The Carthaginians took heart both for\r\nthe reasons indicated and because some allies had joined their cause.\r\nLearning this the Romans in army and city alike had recourse to Scipio\r\nand created him consul in spite of the fact that his age would not\r\nproperly let him hold the office. [Sidenote: Cp. FRAG. 71] His own\r\ndeeds and the excellence of his father Paulus and of his grandfather\r\nAfricanus implanted in the breasts of all a firm hope that through him\r\nthey should vanquish their enemies and utterly root out Carthage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 147 (_a.u._ 607)] While Scipio was en route to Libya,\r\nMancinus was sailing along the coast of Carthage. He noticed a point\r\ncalled Megalia which was inside the city wall and was located on a\r\ncliff having a sheer descent into the sea. This point was a long\r\ndistance away from the rest of the town and had but few guards because\r\nof the natural strength of its position. Suddenly Mancinus applied\r\nladders to it from the ships and ascended. Not till he was safely up\r\ndid some of the Carthaginians hastily gather, but even so they were\r\nunable to repulse him from his vantage ground. He then sent to Piso an\r\naccount of his exploit and a request for assistance. Piso, however,\r\nbeing far in the interior, proved of no aid to Mancinus, but Scipio\r\nhappened along at nightfall just after the receipt of the news and\r\nimmediately sent him help. The Carthaginians would have either\r\ncaptured or destroyed Mancinus, if they had not seen Scipio's vessels\r\nskirting the shore: then they grew discouraged, but would not fall\r\nback. So Scipio sent them some captives to tell them that he was at\r\nhand, upon receipt of which information they no longer stood their\r\nground, but retired to send for Hasdrubal and fortify with trenches\r\nand palisades the cross-wall in front of the residences. Scipio now\r\nleft Mancinus to guard Megalia and himself set out to join Piso and\r\nthe troops so as to have their support in his conduct of operations.\r\nHe made a rapid return journey with the lightest equipped portion of\r\nthe army and found that Hasdrubal had entered Carthage and was\r\nattacking Mancinus fiercely. The arrival of Scipio put an end to the\r\nattack. When Piso too had come there, Scipio bade him take up his\r\nposition outside the wall opposite certain gates, and he sent other\r\nsoldiers around to a little gate a long distance away from the main\r\nforce, with orders as to what they must do. He himself about midnight\r\ntook the strongest portion of the army, got inside the circuit (using\r\ndeserters as guides) and moving quietly to a point inside the little\r\ngate he hacked the bar in two, let in the men who were on the watch\r\noutside and destroyed the guards. Then he hastened to the gate\r\nopposite which Piso had his station, routing the intervening guards\r\n(who were only a few in each place), so that Hasdrubal by the time he\r\nfound out what had happened could see that nearly the entire body of\r\nRoman troops was inside. For a while the Carthaginians withstood them:\r\nthen they abandoned the city, all but the Cotho and Byrsa, in which\r\nthey took refuge. Next Hasdrubal killed all the Roman captives in\r\norder that his people in despair of pardon might show the greater\r\nfortitude in resistance. He also made away with many of the natives on\r\nthe charge that they wanted to betray their own cause. And Scipio\r\nencircled them with trench and palisade and intercepted them by a\r\nwall, yet it was some time before he took them captive. The walls were\r\nstrong and the men within being many in number and confined in a small\r\nspace fought with vehemence. They were well off for food, too, for\r\nBithias from the mainland opposite the city sent merchantmen, amid\r\nwind and wave into the harbor to them so often as there was a heavy\r\ngale blowing. To overcome this obstacle Scipio conceived and executed\r\na startling operation, namely, the damming of the narrow entrance to\r\nthe harbor. The work was difficult and toilsome, for the Carthaginians\r\nundertook to check them, yet he accomplished it by the number of\r\nlaborers at his disposal. Many battles took place in the meantime, but\r\nthe enemy were unable to prevent the filling of the channel.\r\n\r\nIX, 30.--So when the mouth of the harbor had been filled up, the\r\nCarthaginians were terribly oppressed by the scarcity of food; some of\r\nthem deserted, others endured it and died, and still others ate the\r\ndead bodies. Hasdrubal, accordingly, in dejection sent envoys to\r\nScipio with regard to truce, and would have obtained immunity, had he\r\nnot desired to secure both preservation and freedom for all the rest\r\nas well. After he had failed for this reason to accomplish his purpose\r\nhe confined his wife in the acropolis because she had made\r\npropositions to Scipio for the safety of herself and her children, and\r\nbehaved in other ways more boldly on account of his despair. He,\r\ntherefore, and some others, mastered by frenzy, fought both night and\r\nday; and sometimes they would be defeated and sometimes gain\r\nadvantage; and they devised machinery to oppose the Roman engines.\r\nBithias, who held a high-perched fortress and scoured wide stretches\r\nof the mainland, did what he could to help the Carthaginians and\r\ndamage the Romans. Hence Scipio also divided his army, assigning one\r\nhalf of it to invest Carthage while he sent the other half against\r\nBithias, placing at the head of it his lieutenant Gaius Laelius. He\r\nhimself spent his time in passing from one division to the other for\r\ninspection. Then the fortress was taken, and the siege of Carthage was\r\nonce more conducted by an undivided force.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 146 (_a.u._ 608)] The Carthaginians despairing\r\nconsequently of being any longer able to save both walls betook\r\nthemselves to the enclosure of the Byrsa, since it was higher up, at\r\nthe same time transferring thither all the objects that they could.\r\nBy night they burned the dockyard and most of the other structures in\r\norder to deprive the enemy of any benefit from them. When the Romans\r\nbecame aware of their action, they occupied the harbor and advanced\r\nagainst Byrsa. Occupying the houses on each side of it some of the\r\nbesiegers walked straight along on top of the roofs by successively\r\nstepping to those immediately adjacent, and others by digging through\r\nthe walls pushed onward below until they reached the very citadel.\r\nWhen they had got so far, the Carthaginians offered no further\r\nopposition, but all except Hasdrubal sued for clemency. He together\r\nwith the deserters (for Scipio would not grant them a truce) was\r\ncrowded into the temple of AEsculapius, as were also his wife and\r\nchildren, and there he defended himself against assailants until the\r\ndeserters set fire to the temple and climbed to the roof to await the\r\nlast extremity of the flames. Then, beaten, he came to Scipio holding\r\nthe suppliant branch. His wife, who witnessed his entreaty, after\r\ncalling him by name and reproaching him for securing safety for\r\nhimself when he had not allowed her to obtain terms threw her children\r\ninto the fire and likewise cast herself in.\r\n\r\nThus did Scipio take Carthage, and he forwarded to the senate a letter\r\nin these terms: \"Carthage is taken. What are your orders?\" This being\r\nread they held a session to consider what should be done. Cato\r\nadvanced the opinion that they ought to raze the city and blot out the\r\nCarthaginians, whereas Scipio Nasica still advised sparing the\r\nCarthaginians. From this beginning the senate became involved in great\r\ndispute and contention until some one said that if for no other reason\r\nit must be considered necessary to spare them for the Romans' own\r\nsake. With this nation for antagonists they would be sure to practice\r\nexcellence and not turn aside to pleasures and luxury; for if those\r\nwho were able to compel them to practice warlike pursuits should be\r\nremoved from the scene, they might become inferior from want of\r\npractice, for a lack of worthy competitors. As a result of these words\r\nall became unanimous in favor of demolishing Carthage, since they felt\r\nsure that that people would never remain entirely at peace. The whole\r\ntown was therefore overthrown from pinnacle to foundation and it was\r\ndecreed that for any person to settle upon its site should be an\r\naccursed act. The majority of the population captured were thrown into\r\nprison and there perished, and some few (still excepting the very\r\nforemost men) were sold. These leaders and the hostages and Hasdrubal\r\nand Bithias lived to the end of their lives in different parts of\r\nItaly as prisoners, yet free from bonds. Scipio secured both glory and\r\nhonor and was called Africanus not after his grandfather but from his\r\nown achievements.\r\n\r\nIX, 31.--This year likewise saw the ruin of Corinth. The head men of\r\nthe Greeks had been deported to Italy by AEmilius Paulus, whereupon\r\ntheir countrymen at first through embassies kept requesting the return\r\nof the men, and when their prayers were not granted some of the\r\nexiles in despair of ever effecting a return to their homes committed\r\nsuicide. The Greeks took this situation with a very bad grace and made\r\nit a matter of public lamentation, besides evincing anger at any\r\npersons dwelling among them that favored the Roman cause; yet they\r\ndisplayed no open symptoms of hostility until they got back the\r\nremnants of those hostages. [Sidenote: B.C. 149 (_a.u._ 605)] Then\r\nthose that had been wronged and those that had obtained a hold upon\r\nthe goods of others fell into strife and began a real warfare.\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. 72] THE QUARREL BEGAN BY THE ACTION OF THE ACHAEANS IN\r\nBRINGING CHARGES AGAINST THE LACEDAEMONIANS AS BEING RESPONSIBLE FOR\r\nWHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THEM. THE MEDIATORS WHOM THE ROMANS DESPATCHED TO\r\nTHEM THEY WOULD NOT HEED: they rather set their faces toward war,\r\nacting under the supervision of Critolaus. Metellus was consequently\r\nafraid that they might lay hands on Macedonia,--[Sidenote: B.C. 148\r\n(_a.u._ 606)] they had already appeared in Thessaly,--and so he went\r\nto meet them and routed them.\r\n\r\nAt the fall of Critolaus the Greek world was split asunder. Some of\r\nthem had embraced peace and laid down their weapons, whereas others\r\nhad committed their interests to the care of Diaeus and were still\r\ninvolved in factional turmoil. [Sidenote: B.C. 146 (_a.u._ 608)] On\r\nlearning this the people of Rome sent Mummius against them. He got rid\r\nof Metellus and gave his personal attention to the war. Part of his\r\narmy sustained a slight reverse through an ambuscade and Diaeus pursued\r\nthe fugitives up to their own camp, but Mummius made a sortie, routed\r\nhim, and followed to the Achaean entrenchments. Diaeus now gathered a\r\nlarger force and undertook to give battle to them, but, as the Romans\r\nwould make no hostile demonstration, he conceived a contempt for them\r\nand advanced to a depressed piece of ground lying between the camps.\r\nMummius seeing this secretly sent horsemen to assail them on the\r\nflank. After these had attacked and thrown the enemy into confusion,\r\nhe brought up the phalanx in front and caused considerable slaughter.\r\nAs a consequence Diaeus in despair killed himself, and of the survivors\r\nof the battle the Corinthians were scattered over the country, while\r\nthe rest fled to their homes. Hence the Corinthians within the wall\r\nbelieving that all their citizens had been lost abandoned the city,\r\nand it was empty of men when Mummius took it. After that he won over\r\nwithout trouble both that nation and the rest of the Greeks. He now\r\ntook possession of their arms, all the offerings that were consecrated\r\nin their temples, the statues, paintings, and whatever other kind of\r\nornament they had; and as soon as he could send his father and some\r\nother men to arrange terms for the vanquished he caused the walls of\r\nsome of the cities to be taken down and declared them all to be free\r\nand independent except the Corinthians. The dwellers in Corinth he\r\nsold, and confiscated their land and demolished their walls and all\r\ntheir houses besides, out of fear that some states might again unite\r\nwith them, since they constituted the greatest state. To prevent any\r\nof them from remaining hidden and any of the other Greeks from being\r\nsold as Corinthians he assembled everybody present before he had\r\ndisclosed his determination, and after having his soldiers surround\r\nthem in such a way as not to attract notice he proclaimed the\r\nenslavement of the Corinthians and the liberation of the remainder.\r\nThen he instructed them all to take hold of any Corinthians standing\r\nbeside them. In this way he arrived at an accurate distinction.\r\n\r\nThus was Corinth overthrown. The rest of the Greek world suffered\r\ntemporarily from murders and levies of money, but afterward came to\r\nenjoy such immunity and prosperity that it used to be said: \"If they\r\nhad not been taken captive as early as they were, they could not have\r\nbeen preserved.\"\r\n\r\nSo this end simultaneously befell Carthage and Corinth, famous,\r\nancient cities: but at a much later date they received colonies of\r\nRomans, became again flourishing, and regained their original\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe exploits of the Romans up to this point, found by me in ancient\r\nbooks that record these matters, written by men of old time, I have\r\ndrawn thence in a condensed form and have embodied in the present\r\nhistory. As for what comes next in order,--the transactions of the\r\nconsuls and dictators, so long as the government of Rome was still\r\nconducted by these officials,--let no one censure me as having passed\r\nthis by through contempt or indolence or antipathy and having left the\r\nhistory as it were incomplete. The gap has not been overlooked by me\r\nthrough sloth, nor have I of my own free will left my task half\r\nfinished, but through lack of books to describe the events. I have\r\nfrequently instituted a search for them, yet I have not found them,\r\nand I do not know whether the cause is that the passage of time has\r\ndestroyed them, and so they are not preserved, or whether the persons\r\nto whom I entrusted the errand perhaps did not search for them with\r\nsufficient diligence; for I was living abroad and passing my life on\r\nan islet far from the city. And because it has not been my lot to gain\r\naccess to these books in this instance, my history turns out to be\r\nonly half complete for the acts of the consuls and even for those of\r\nthe dictators. Hence, passing over them, though reluctantly, I will\r\nrecord the deeds of the emperors, with some brief introductory remarks\r\nto make clear to those who shall read my history by what steps the\r\nRomans passed from aristocracy (or democracy) to the rule of one man,\r\nand to impart, in addition, coherence to the narrative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.--NO SUMMARY EXISTS OF THE MISSING BOOKS TWENTY-TWO TO\r\nTHIRTY-FIVE INCLUSIVE, AND WE ARE DRIVEN TO RELY ON SCATTERED AND\r\nINCONSEQUENTIAL FRAGMENTS (THAT HAVE SOMEHOW ESCAPED THE WRECK OF\r\nSEASONS) AS THE BASIS FOR WHATEVER MENTAL IMAGE WE MAY CHOOSE TO FORM\r\nOF THE LOST NARRATIVE.

LXXIII] (Par.) Viriathus was a Lusitanian, of very\r\nobscure origin, as some think, who enjoyed great renown through his\r\ndeeds, for from a shepherd he became a robber and later on also a\r\ngeneral. He was naturally adapted and had trained himself to be very\r\nquick in pursuing and fleeing, and of great force in a stationary\r\nconflict. He was glad to get any food that came to hand and whatever\r\ndrink fell to his lot; he lived most of his life under the open sky\r\nand was satisfied with nature's bedding. Consequently he was\r\nsuperior to any heat or any cold, and neither was he ever troubled\r\nby hunger nor did he suffer from any other disagreeable condition;\r\nsince he found all his wants met quite sufficiently by whatever he\r\nhad at hand, which seemed to him unexcelled. While he possessed\r\nsuch a physical constitution, as the result of nature and training,\r\nhe surpassed still more in spiritual endowment. He was swift to\r\nperceive and do whatever was requisite,--he could tell what must\r\nbe done and at the same time he understood the proper occasion for\r\nit,--and he was clever at pretending not to know the most evident\r\nfacts and to know the most hidden secrets. Furthermore he was not\r\nonly general but his own assistant in every business equally,\r\nand was seen to be neither humble nor pompous, but in him obscurity\r\nof family and reputation for strength were so mingled that he\r\nseemed to be neither inferior nor superior to any one. And, in\r\nfine, he carried on the war not for the sake of personal gain or\r\npower nor through anger, but because of the opportunity for action;\r\ntherefore he was regarded as most thoroughly a lover of war and a\r\nsuccessful warrior. (Valesius, p. 614.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXIV] [Sidenote: B.C. 143 (_a.u._ 611)] 1.\r\n(Par.) Claudius, the colleague of Metellus, impelled by pride of birth\r\nand jealousy of Metellus, when he had had Italy allotted to his command\r\nand found no sign of war, was eager to secure by any means some\r\npretext for a triumph; hence without taking the trouble to lodge any\r\nformal complaint he set the Salassi, a Gallic tribe, at war with the\r\nRomans. He had been sent to reconcile them, because they were\r\ndisputing with their neighbors about the water necessary for the gold\r\nmines, and he overran their entire country ... the Romans sent him two\r\nof the ten priests. (Valesius, p. 617.)\r\n\r\n2. (Par.) Claudius, even if he understood thoroughly that he had not\r\nconquered, nevertheless even then displayed such arrogance as not to\r\nsay a word in either the senate or the popular assembly about the\r\ntriumph; but acting as if the right were indisputably his, even if no\r\none should vote to that effect, he asked for the requisite\r\nexpenditures. (Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXV] [Sidenote: B.C. 142 (_a.u._ 612)] (Par.) As\r\nregards character Mummius and Africanus differed vastly from each\r\nother in every respect. The latter ruled with a view to the greatest\r\nuprightness and with exactitude, not esteeming one influence above\r\nanother; he called to account many of the senators and many of the\r\nknights, as well as other individuals. Mummius, on the other hand, was\r\nmore urbane and humane in his behavior; he imputed no dishonor to any\r\none, and abolished many of the regulations framed by Africanus, so far\r\nas was possible. To such an extent of amiability did his nature lead\r\nhim, that he lent some statues to Lucullus for the consecration of the\r\ntemple of Felicitas (material for which he had gathered in the Spanish\r\nwar), and then, when that general was unwilling to return them on the\r\nground that they had been made sacred by the dedication, he showed no\r\nanger, but permitted his own spoils to lie there offered up in\r\nanother's name. (Valesius, p. 618.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXVI] [Sidenote: B.C. 140 (_a.u._ 614)]\r\n(Par.) Pompeius[41] received many setbacks and incurred great disgrace.\r\nThere was a river flowing through the country of the Numantini that he\r\nwished to turn aside from its ancient channel and let in upon their\r\nfields; and after tremendous exertions he did accomplish this. But he\r\nlost many soldiers, and no advantage from turning it aside came to the\r\nRomans, nor harm to the enemy.... (Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: This is Q. Pompeius A. F. Nepos (consul B.C. 141).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXVII] (Par.) Caepio[42] effected nothing worthy of\r\nmention against the foe, but brought much serious harm to his own men,\r\nso that he ran the risk of being killed by them. He treated them all,\r\nbut especially the cavalry, with such harshness and cruelty that a vast\r\nnumber of most unseemly jokes and stories passed current about him\r\nduring the nights; and the more he grew vexed at it, the more jests\r\ndid they make and endeavor to infuriate him. When what was going on\r\nbecame known and no one could be found guilty--though he suspected it\r\nwas the doing of the cavalry--as he could fix the responsibility upon\r\nno one single man he became angry at all of them, and commanded them,\r\nsix hundred in number, accompanied only by their grooms, to cross the\r\nriver by which they were encamped and bring wood from the mountain on\r\nwhich Viriathus was bivouacking. The danger was manifest to all, and\r\nthe tribunes and lieutenants begged him not to destroy them. The\r\ncavalry waited for a little to see if he would listen to the others,\r\nand when he would not yield, they deemed it unworthy to supplicate\r\nhim, as he was most eager for them to do, but choosing rather to\r\nperish utterly than to speak a respectful word to him, they started on\r\nthe mission assigned. The horsemen of the allies and other volunteers\r\naccompanied them. They crossed the river, cut the wood, and threw it\r\nin all around the general's quarters, intending to burn them down. And\r\nhe would have perished in the flames, if he had not fled away in time.\r\n(Valesius, p. 618.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: _Q. Servilius Caepio_ (consul B.C. 140).]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXVIII] [Sidenote: B.C. 139 (_a.u._ 615)] (Par.)\r\nPopilius so terrified Viriathus that the latter sent to him about peace\r\nimmediately and before they had tried any battle at all, killed some\r\nof the leaders of the rebels whose surrender had been demanded by the\r\nRomans--among these his father-in-law, though commanding his own\r\nforce, was slaughtered--and delivered up the rest, all of whose hands\r\nthe consul cut off. And he would have agreed to a complete truce, if\r\ntheir weapons had not been demanded in addition: with this condition\r\nneither he nor the rest of the throng would comply.[43] (Ursinus, p.\r\n383.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Adopting Reiske's conjecture [Greek: hypomeinai epsesen]\r\nin place of the MS.

The\r\nRomans received the Numantine ambassadors on their arrival outside the\r\nwalls, to the end that their reception might not seem to imply a\r\nratification of the truce. However, they sent gifts of friendship\r\nnotwithstanding, not wishing to deprive them of the hope of possibly\r\ncoming to terms. Mancinus and his followers told of the necessity of\r\nthe compact made and the number of the saved, and stated that they\r\nstill held all of their former possessions in Spain. They besought\r\ntheir countrymen to consider the question not in the light of their\r\npresent immunity, but with reference to the danger that then\r\nencompassed the soldiers, and to think not what ought to have been\r\ndone, but what might have been the outcome. The Numantini brought\r\nforward many statements about their previous good-will toward the\r\nRomans and considerable about the latter's subsequent injustice,\r\nby reason of which they had been forced into the war, and the\r\nperjury of Pompeius: and they asked for considerate treatment in\r\nreturn for the preservation of Mancinus and the rest. But the\r\nRomans both dissolved the truce and decided that Mancinus should\r\nbe given up to the Numantini. (Ursinus, p. 383.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXX] (Par.) Claudius[44] through his harshness would\r\nhave committed many outrageous acts, had he not been restrained by his\r\ncolleague Quintus.[45] The latter, who was amiable and possessed\r\nexactly the opposite temperament, did not oppose him with anger in any\r\nmatter and, indeed, occasionally yielded to him, and by gentle\r\nbehavior so manipulated him that he found very few opportunities for\r\nirritation. (Valesius, p. 621.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: These are the censors for the year B.C. 136, Ap.\r\nClaudius Pulcher and Q.

Furius[46] led out among his lieutenants\r\nboth Pompeius and Metellus though they were hostile both to him and to\r\neach other; for, expecting to achieve some great success, he wished to\r\nhave in them sure witnesses to his deeds and to receive the evidence of\r\nhis prowess from their unwilling lips. (Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: P. Furius Philus (consul B.C. 136).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 24, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXXIII] 1. (Par.) Tiberius Gracchus caused an upheaval\r\nof the Roman state,--and this in spite of the fact that he belonged to\r\none of the foremost families (his grandfather being Africanus), that\r\nhe possessed a natural endowment worthy of the latter, that he had\r\ngone through a most thorough course of education, and had a high\r\nspirit. In proportion to these great gifts of his was the allurement\r\nthat they offered to follow his ambitions: and when once he had turned\r\naside from what was best he drifted even involuntarily into what was\r\nworst. It began with his being refused a triumph over the Numantini:\r\nhe had hoped for this honor because he had previously had the\r\nmanagement of the business, but so far from obtaining anything of the\r\nkind he incurred the danger of being delivered up; then he decided\r\nthat deeds were estimated not on the basis of goodness or truth but\r\naccording to mere chance. And this road to fame he abandoned as not\r\nsafe, but since he desired by all means to become prominent in some\r\nway and expected that he could accomplish this better through the\r\npopular than through the senatorial party, he attached himself to the\r\nformer. (Valesius, p. 621.)\r\n\r\n2. (Par.) Marcus Octavius on account of an hereditary feud with Gracchus\r\nwillingly made himself his opponent. [Sidenote: B.C. 133 (_a.u._ 621)]\r\nThereafter there was no semblance of moderation: striving and\r\nquarreling as they were, each to survive the other rather than to\r\nbenefit the community, they committed many acts of violence as if they\r\nwere in a principality instead of a democracy, and suffered many\r\nunusual calamities proper for war but not for peace. In addition to\r\ntheir individual conflicts, there were many who, banded together,\r\ninstituted grievous abuses and battles in the senate-house itself and\r\nthe popular assembly as well as throughout the rest of the city: they\r\npretended to be executing the law, but were in reality making in all\r\nthings every effort not to be surpassed by each other. The result was\r\nthat the authorities could not carry on their accustomed tasks, courts\r\ncame to a stop, no contract was entered into, and other sorts of\r\nconfusion and disorder were rife everywhere. The place bore the name\r\nof city, but was no whit different from a camp. (Valesius, p. 622.)\r\n\r\n3. (Par.) Gracchus proposed certain laws for the benefit of those of\r\nthe people who served in the army, and transferred the courts from\r\nthe senate to the knights, bedeviling and disturbing all established\r\ncustoms in order that he might be enabled to lay hold on safety in\r\nsome wise. And after he found not even this of advantage to him, but\r\nhis term of office was drawing to a close, when he would be\r\nimmediately exposed to the attacks of his enemies, he attempted to\r\nsecure the tribuneship also for the following year (in company with\r\nhis brother) and to appoint his father-in-law consul: to obtain this\r\nend he would make any statement or promise anything whatever to\r\nanybody. Often, too, he put on a mourning garb and brought his mother\r\nand children, tied hand and foot, into the presence of the populace.\r\n(Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXXIII] [Sidenote: B.C. 129 (_a.u._ 625)] (Par.)\r\nScipio Africanus had more ambition in his makeup than was suitable for\r\nor compatible with his general excellence. And in reality none of his\r\nrivals took pleasure in his death, but although they thought him a\r\ngreat obstacle in their way even they missed him. They saw that he was\r\nvaluable to the State and never expected that he would cause them any\r\nserious trouble. When he was suddenly taken away all the possessions\r\nof the powerful class were again diminished, so that the promoters of\r\nagrarian legislation ravaged at will practically all of Italy. And\r\nthis seems to me to have been most strongly indicated by the mass of\r\nstones that poured down from heaven, falling upon some of the temples\r\nand killing men, and by the tears of Apollo. [Sidenote: B.C. 131\r\n(_a.u._ 623)] For the god wept copiously[47] for three days, so that\r\nthe Romans on the advice of the soothsayers voted to cut down the\r\nstatue and to sink it in the deep. (Valesius, p. 625.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: In the original the word \"wept\" is repeated. Van\r\nHerwerden thinks that the second one should be deleted, but Schenkl\r\nprefers to substitute an adverb in place of the first. In the\r\ntranslation I have used an adverb giving nearly the same force as the\r\nrepetition of the verb.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 25, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXXIV] (Par.) Gracchus had a disposition like his\r\nbrother; only the latter drifted from excellence into ambition and then\r\nto baseness whereas this man was naturally intractable and played the\r\nrogue voluntarily and far surpassed the other in his gift of language.\r\nFor these reasons his designs were more mischievous, his daring more\r\nspontaneous, and his self-will greater in all junctures alike. He was\r\nthe first to walk up and down in the assemblies while he harangued and\r\nthe first to bare his arm; hence neither of these practices has been\r\nthought improper, since he did it. And because his speaking was\r\ncharacterized by great condensation of thought and forcefulness of\r\nwords and he consequently was unable to restrain himself easily but\r\nwas often led to say what he did not wish, he used to bring in a\r\nflute-player, and from him, playing a low accompaniment, he would take\r\nhis rhythm and time, or if even so he in some way fell out of measure,\r\nhe would stop. This was the sort of man that attacked the government,\r\nand, by assuming no speech or act to be forbidden, in the briefest\r\ntime became a great power among the populace and the knights. All the\r\nnobility and the senatorial party if he had lived longer[48] ...\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 121 (_a.u._ 633)] but as it was his great authority\r\nmade him envied even by the members of his faction, and he was ruined\r\nby his own devices. (Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: One may supply here, as Reiske suggests, \"would have\r\nbeen overthrown\", \"would have been humbled\", or \"would have been\r\nbrought low\".]\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 26, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXXV] [Sidenote: B.C. 114 (_a.u._ 640)] 1. (Par.)\r\nThe priestesses for the most part incurred destruction and shame\r\nthemselves, and proved the source of great evils to numerous others as\r\nwell, while the entire city because of them was thrown into an uproar.\r\nFor the people, in view of the fact that what was immaculate by law\r\nand sacred by the dictates of religion and decent through fear of\r\nvengeance had been polluted, were ready to believe that anything most\r\nshameful and unholy might be done. For this reason they visited\r\npunishment not only on the convicted, but also on all the rest who had\r\nbeen accused, to show their hatred of what had occurred. Hence the\r\nwhole episode in which the women were concerned seemed now to be due\r\nnot so much to their feminine incontinence[49] as to a kind of madness\r\ninspired by supernatural powers. (Valesius, p. 626.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Reading [Greek: eti aselgeias] (Boissevain's emendation)\r\nin place of the unintelligible [Greek: aitias algein] of the MS.]\r\n\r\n2. (Par.) Three altogether had had intercourse with men; and of them\r\nMarcia had acted individually, granting her favors to one single\r\nknight[50] and would never have been discovered, had not the\r\ninvestigation into the cases of the others spread and overtaken her\r\nbesides. AEmilia and Licinia had a multitude of lovers and carried\r\non their wanton behavior with each other's help. At first they\r\nsurrendered themselves to some few privately and secretly, telling\r\neach man that he was the only one admitted. Later they themselves\r\nbound every one who could suspect and inform against them to certain\r\nsilence in advance by the price of intercourse with them, and those\r\nwho had previously enjoyed their conversation, though they saw this,\r\nyet endured it in order not to be detected by a show of vexation.\r\nSo after holding commerce with many, now singly, now in groups,\r\nnow privately, now publicly, Licinia enjoyed the society of the\r\nbrother of AEmilia, and AEmilia that of Licinia's brother. These\r\ndoings were hidden for a great period of time, and though many\r\nmen and many women, both free and slaves, were in the secret, it\r\nwas hidden for a very long period, until one Manius,[51] who\r\nseems to have been the first to assist and cooeperate in the\r\nwhole evil, gave information of the matter because he had not\r\nobtained freedom nor any of the other objects of his hope. He was,\r\nindeed, very skillful not only at leading women into prostitution, but\r\nalso in slandering and ruining some of them. (Valesius, p. 626.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: Namely, L. Betutius Barrus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: A slave of the aforesaid Barrus.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXXVI] [Sidenote: B.C. 112 (_a.u._ 642)] (Par.) This\r\nwas calculated to bring him [sc. Marcus Drusus] glory first of itself\r\nand second in the light of Cato's disaster; and because he had shown\r\ngreat amiability toward the soldiers and seemed to have made success of\r\nmore importance than truth, he also secured a renown greater than his\r\ndeeds deserved. (Valesius, p. 629.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. LXXXVII] [Sidenote: B.C. 108 (_a.u._ 646)] 1. (Par.)\r\nWhen Jugurtha sent to Metellus about peace the latter made separate\r\ndemands upon him as if each were to be the last, and in this way got\r\nfrom him hostages, arms, the elephants, the captives, and the deserters.\r\nAll of these last he killed but did not grant a truce because Jugurtha,\r\nfearing to be arrested, refused to come to him and because Marius and\r\nGnaeus[52] prevented. (Ursinus, p. 385.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: Possibly an error for _Gaudas_.]\r\n\r\n2. For he [sc. Marius] was in general seditious and turbulent, wholly\r\nfriendly to the rabble from which he had sprung and wholly ready to\r\noverthrow the nobility. He risked with perfect readiness any\r\nstatement, promise, lie, or false oath in any matter where he hoped to\r\ngain a benefit. Blackmailing one of the foremost citizens or\r\ncommending some rascal he thought child's play. And let no one be\r\nsurprised that such a man could conceal his villanies for a very long\r\ntime: for, as a result of his exceeding cunning and the good fortune\r\nwhich he enjoyed all through his early life, he actually acquired a\r\nreputation for virtue. (Valesius, p. 629.)\r\n\r\n3. (Par.) Marius was the more easily able to calumniate Metellus for the\r\nreason that the latter was numbered among the nobles and was managing\r\nmilitary concerns excellently, whereas he himself was just beginning\r\nto come forward from a very obscure and doubtful origin into public\r\nnotice:--the populace was readily inclined to overthrow Metellus\r\nthrough envy, and favored Marius increasingly for his promises:--of\r\ngreat assistance, too, was the report that Metellus had said to Marius\r\n(who was just then coming forward for election): \"You ought to be\r\nsatisfied if you get to be consul along with my son\" (who was a mere\r\nlad). (Valesius, p. 630.)\r\n\r\n4. (Par.) Gaudas was angry at Metellus because in spite of requests\r\nhe had received from him neither the deserters nor a garrison of Roman\r\nsoldiers, or else because he could not sit near him,--a privilege\r\nordinarily vouchsafed by the consuls to princes and potentates.\r\n(Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 107 (_a.u._ 647)] 5. (Par.) When Cirta was captured by\r\ncapitulation Bocchus sent a herald to Marius and first demanded the\r\nempire of Jugurtha as the price for his defection, but later, as he\r\ndid not obtain it, simply asked him to make terms. So he sent envoys\r\nto Rome, but Jugurtha while this was taking place retired to the most\r\ndesolate portions of his own territory. (Ursinus, p. 385.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 106 (_a.u._ 648)] 6. (Par.) Marius entertained the\r\nenvoys of Bocchus but said he would make no compact with him unless he\r\nshould receive Jugurtha's prisoners from his hands; and this was done.\r\n(Ursinus, p. 386.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_(BOOK 27, BOISSEVAIN.)_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG.

Tolosa, which was formerly at peace\r\nwith the Romans but had revolted, under the influence of hope in the\r\nCimbri, to the extent of imprisoning the garrison, was occupied by\r\nthem at night: they were admitted unexpectedly by friends and\r\nplundered the temples, obtaining much other money besides, for the\r\nplace had been wealthy from of old, containing among other offerings\r\nthose of which the Gauls under the leadership of Brennus had once\r\ndespoiled Delphi. Nothing of importance, however, reached the Romans\r\nin the capital, but the victors themselves confiscated the most of it.\r\nFor this a number were called to account.

Servilius by reason of his jealousy of his colleague[53] became\r\nthe cause of many evils to the army; for, though he had in general equal\r\npowers, his repute was naturally diminished by the fact that the other\r\nwas also consul. And ... after the death of Scaurus[54] he [Manlius?]\r\nsent for Servilius: but the latter replied that each of them ought to\r\nkeep his position. Then, apprehending that Manlius might gain some\r\nsuccess by his own resources, he grew jealous of him, fearing that he\r\nmight secure individual glory, and went to him: yet he did not bivouac\r\non the same ground nor make him the partaker of any plan, but took up\r\na distinct position with the evident intention of joining battle with\r\nthe Cimbri before him and winning all the glory of the war. At the\r\noutset they still inspired the enemy with dread, as long as their\r\nquarrel was concealed, so much so as to lead the foe to desire peace,\r\nbut when the Cimbri sent a herald to Manlius as consul Servilius\r\nbecame indignant that they had not directed their embassy to him,\r\nrefused to agree to any reconciliation, and came near slaying the\r\nenvoys.

The soldiers forced Servilius to go to Manlius and consult\r\nwith him about the emergency. But so far from coming into accord they\r\nbecame as a result of the meeting even more hostile than before: they\r\nfell into strife and abuse and parted in a disgraceful fashion.\r\n(Valesius, p. 633.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG.

After\r\nGnaeus Domitius obtained leave to bring suit against Scaurus, one of\r\nthe slaves then came forward and offered to bring any damaging\r\ncharges against his master: but he refused to become involved in such\r\ndespicable business, and arresting the fellow delivered him over to\r\nScaurus. (Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. XCI] 1. (Par.) Publius Licinius Nerva, who was praetor\r\nin the island, on learning that the slaves were not being justly treated\r\nin some respects, or else because he sought an occasion of profit (for\r\nhe was not inaccessible to bribes), circulated the announcement that\r\nall who had any charges to bring against their masters should come to\r\nhim, for he would assist them. Accordingly, many of them banded\r\ntogether, and some declared they were being wronged and others made\r\nknown some other grievances against their masters, thinking they had\r\nsecured an opportunity for accomplishing without bloodshedding all\r\nthat they wished. The freeborn, after consultation, resisted them and\r\nwould not yield to them on any point. Therefore Licinius, inspired\r\nwith fear by the united front of both sides and dreading that some\r\ngreat mischief might be done by the defeated party, would not admit\r\nany of the slaves but sent them away thinking that they would suffer\r\nno harm or that at any rate they would be scattered and so could cause\r\nno more disturbance. But they, fearing their masters because they had\r\ndared to raise their voices at all against them, organized a force and\r\nby common consent turned to robbery.

The Messenians, believing\r\nthat they would suffer no abuse, had deposited in that place for safe\r\nkeeping all their most valuable and highly prized possessions.\r\nAthenio, who as a Cilician held the chief command of the robbers, on\r\nlearning this attacked them while they were celebrating a public\r\nfestival in the suburbs, killed many of them as they were scattered\r\nabout, and almost took the city by storm. After building a wall to\r\nfortify Macella,[55] a strong position, he did serious injury to the\r\ncountry.

After\r\nthe defeat of the barbarians though many had fallen in battle some few\r\nwere saved. Whereupon Marius attempted to console these survivors and\r\nto make amends by restoring to them all the plunder at a nominal\r\nprice, to prevent its being thought that he had bestowed favors\r\ngratuitously upon any one. By this act Marius, who previously had been\r\nthe darling of the populace alone because sprung from that class and\r\nraised to power by it, now won over even the nobles by whom he was\r\nhated, and was praised equally by all. He received from a willing and\r\nharmonious people a reelection for the following year, to enable him\r\nto subdue his remaining foes. (Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n2. (Par.)

The\r\nreason was that in place of their former outdoor life they rested in\r\nhouses, instead of their former cold plunges they used warm baths,\r\nwhereas they were wont to eat raw meat they now filled themselves with\r\nrichly spiced dishes and relishes of the country, and they saturated\r\nthemselves, contrary to their custom, with wine and strong drink.\r\nThese practices extinguished all their fiery spirit and enervated\r\ntheir bodies, so that they could no longer bear toils or hardships or\r\nheat or cold or sleeplessness.

The\r\nson of Metellus besought everybody to such an extent both in private\r\nand in public to let his father return from exile that he received the\r\nappellation _Pius_, i.e. dutiful. (Valesius, p. 638.)\r\n\r\n2. (Par.) Furius had such enmity toward Metellus that when he was censor\r\nhe took his horse away. (Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n3. Publius Furius,[56] indicted for his deeds committed in the\r\ntribuneship, was slain by the Romans in the Comitia itself. He richly\r\ndeserved to die, for he was a seditious person and after first joining\r\nSaturninus and Glaucia he veered about, deserted to the opposing\r\nfaction, and joined its members; it was not proper, however, for him\r\nto perish in just this way. And this action seemed to be on the whole\r\njustifiable. (Valesius, p. 637.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: He was tribune of the plebs, B.C. 99.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. XCIV] 1. For there were other factional leaders, but\r\nthe greatest authority was possessed by Marcius[57] over one group,\r\nand by Quintus[58] over the other: these men were eager for power, of\r\ninsatiable ambition, and consequently greatly inclined toward strife.\r\nThose qualities they possessed in common; but Drusus had the advantage\r\nof birth, and of wealth, which he lavishly expended upon those who at\r\nany time made demands upon him, while the other greatly surpassed him\r\nin audacity, daring, the anticipation of plots, and malignity\r\nsuitable to the occasion. Hence not unnaturally, since they\r\nsupplemented each other partly by their likeness and partly by their\r\ndifferences, they created an extremely strong factional feeling which\r\nremained even after the death of both. (Valesius, p. 638.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: _M. Livius Drusus._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 58: _Q. Servilius Caepio._]\r\n\r\n2. (Par.)

He was brought to\r\ncourt by a preconcerted plan of the knights on a charge of having been\r\nbribed while serving in Asia as lieutenant under Quintus Mucius,[59]\r\nand they imposed a fine upon him. The reason for this act was their\r\nrage at his having ended many of their irregularities in connection\r\nwith the collecting of taxes. (Valesius, p. 637.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 59: The clause as found in the MS. gives no sense. The\r\ntranslation here is on the basis of an emendation suggested by\r\nBoissevain.]\r\n\r\n2. (Par.) Rutilius made a very able defence, and there was no one of his\r\nwords which would not be the natural utterance of an upright man who\r\nwas being blackmailed and grieved far more for the conditions of the\r\nState than for his own possessions: he was convicted, however, and\r\nimmediately stripped of his property. This process more than any other\r\nrevealed the fact that he had in no wise deserved the sentence passed\r\nupon him. He was found to possess much less than the accusers had\r\ncharged him with having confiscated from Asia, and he could trace all\r\nof his goods back to just and lawful sources of acquisition. Such was\r\nhis unworthy treatment, and Marius was not free from responsibility\r\nfor his conviction; a man so excellent and of such good repute had\r\nbeen an annoyance to him. Wherefore Rutilius, indignant at the conduct\r\nof affairs in the city, and disdaining to live longer in the company\r\nof such a creature, withdrew, though under no compulsion, and went\r\neven as far as Asia. There for a time he dwelt in Mitylene; then after\r\nthat place had received injury in the Mithridatic war he transferred\r\nhis residence to Smyrna and there lived to the end of his life nor\r\nwished ever to return home. And in all this he suffered not a whit in\r\nreputation or plenty. He received many gifts from Mucius and a vast\r\nnumber from all the peoples and kings as well who had become\r\nacquainted with him, till he possessed far more than his original\r\nproperty.

(Par.)\r\nLupus,[60] suspecting that the patricians making the campaign with him\r\nwere revealing his plans to the enemy, sent word about them to the\r\nsenate before he had any definite information,[61] and, as a\r\nconsequence, although they were in no case well disposed[62] toward\r\neach other through factional differences, he set them still more at\r\nvariance. There would have been even greater disturbance, had not some\r\nof the Marsi been detected mixing with the foraging parties of the\r\nRomans and entering the ramparts under the guise of allies, where they\r\ntook cognizance of speeches and actions in the camp and reported them\r\nto their own men. In consequence of this discovery they ceased to be\r\nangry with the patricians. (Valesius, p. 641.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _P.

Marius suspected Lupus, although a relative, and through\r\njealousy and hope of being appointed consul even a seventh time as the\r\nonly man who could bring success out of the existing situation, bade\r\nhim delay: their men, he said, would have provisions, whereas the\r\nother side would not be able to hold out for any considerable time\r\nwhen the war was in their country.

Mithridates, when the Roman envoys[63]\r\narrived, did not make the slightest move, but after bringing some\r\ncounter-charges and also exhibiting to the envoys the amount of his\r\nwealth, some of which he had at that time spent on various objects\r\npublic and private, he remained quiet. But Nicomedes, elated by their\r\nalliance and being in need of money, invaded his territory. (Ursinus,\r\np. 386.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: Their leader was M.' Aquilius.]\r\n\r\n2. (Par.) Mithridates despatched envoys to Rome requesting them if they\r\ndeemed Nicomedes a friend to persuade him or compel him to act justly\r\ntoward him, or if not, to allow him (Mithridates) to take measures\r\nagainst his foe. They, so far from doing what he wished, even\r\nthreatened him with punishment if he should not give back Cappadocia\r\nto Ariobarzanes and remain at peace with Nicomedes. His envoys they\r\nsent away the very day and furthermore ordered him never to send\r\nanother one unless he should render them obedience. (Ursinus, ib.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG.

He would\r\ncertainly have been killed, if they had had plenty of stones; but\r\nsince the site where they were assembled was given over to\r\nagriculture and happened to be very wet, he received no hurt\r\nfrom the clods of earth. The man who began the mutiny, Gaius\r\nTitius,[65] was arrested: he was a low fellow who made his living in\r\nthe courts and was excessively and shamelessly outspoken; he was sent\r\nto the city to the tribunes, but escaped punishment.

All\r\nthe Asiatics, at the bidding of Mithridates, massacred the Romans; only\r\nthe people of Tralles did not personally kill any one, but hired a\r\ncertain Theophilus, a Paphlagonian (as if the victims were more likely\r\nthus to escape destruction, or as if it made any difference to them by\r\nwhom they should be slaughtered). (Valesius, p. 642.)\r\n\r\n2. (Par.)

Cinna,\r\nas soon as he took possession of the office, was anxious upon no one\r\npoint so much as to drive Sulla out of Italy. He made Mithridates his\r\nexcuse, but in reality wanted this leader to remove himself that he\r\nmight not, by lurking close at hand, prove a hindrance to the objects\r\nthat Cinna had in mind. He fairly distinguished himself by his zeal\r\nfor Sulla and would refuse to promise nothing that pleased him. For\r\nSulla, who saw the urgency of the war and was eager for its glory,\r\nbefore starting had arranged everything at home for his own best\r\ninterests. He appointed Cinna and one Gnaeus Octavius to be his\r\nsuccessors, hoping in this way to retain considerable power even while\r\nabsent. The second of the two he understood was generally approved for\r\nhis excellence and good nature, and he thought he would cause no\r\ntrouble: the other he well knew was an unprincipled person, but he did\r\nnot wish to antagonize him, because the man had some influence and was\r\nready, as he had said and declared on oath, to assist him in every way\r\npossible. Sulla himself, though an adept at discovering the minds of\r\nmen and inferring correctly in regard to the nature of things, made a\r\nthorough mistake in this matter and bequeathed a great war to the\r\nState. (Valesius, p. 642.)\r\n\r\n2. (Par.) Octavius was naturally dull in politics. (Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n3. (Par.) The Romans, when civil war set in, sent for Metellus,\r\nurging him to help them. (Ursinus, p. 386.)\r\n\r\n4. (Par.) The Romans, at odds with one another, sent for Metellus and\r\nbade him come to terms with the Samnites, as he best might: for at this\r\ntime they alone were still damaging Campania and the district beyond\r\nit. He, however, concluded no truce with them. They demanded\r\ncitizenship to be given not to themselves alone but also to those who\r\nhad deserted to their side, refused to give up any of the booty which\r\nthey had, but demanded back all the captives and deserters from their\r\nown ranks, so that even the senators no longer chose to make peace\r\nwith them on these terms. (Ursinus, p. 385.)\r\n\r\n5. (Par.) When Cinna had put in force again the law regarding the return\r\nof exiles, Marius and the rest of his followers who had been expelled\r\nleaped into the city with the army left to them by all the gates at\r\nonce; these they shut, so that no one could make his escape, and\r\ndespatched every man they met, making no distinction, but treating\r\nthem all alike as enemies. They took special pains to destroy any\r\npersons who had possessions, because they coveted such property, and\r\noutraged their children and wives as if they had enslaved some foreign\r\ncity. The heads of the most eminent citizens they fastened to the\r\nrostra. That sight was no less cruel than their ruin; for the thought\r\nmight occur to the spectators that what their ancestors had adorned\r\nwith the beaks of the enemy was now being deformed by the heads of the\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nFor, in fine, so great a desire and greed for slaughter possessed\r\nMarius, that when he had killed most of his enemies and no one because\r\nof the great confusion prevailing occurred to him whom he wished to\r\ndestroy, he gave the word to the soldiers to stab all in succession of\r\nthe passers-by to whom he should not extend his hand. For Roman\r\naffairs had come to this, that a man had to die not only without a\r\ntrial and without having incurred enmity, but by reason of Marius's\r\nhand not being stretched out. Now naturally in so great a throng and\r\nuproar it was not only no object to Marius to make the gesture, but it\r\nwas not even possible, no matter how much he wished it, to use his\r\nhand as he pleased. Hence many died for naught who ought certainly on\r\nevery account not to have been slain. The entire number of the\r\nmurdered is beyond finding out; for the slaughter went on five whole\r\ndays and an equal number of nights. (Valesius, p. 642.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 86 (_a.u._ 668)] 6. (Par.) While the Romans were offering\r\nthe New Year's sacrifice at the opening of the season and making their\r\nvows[66] for their magistrate according to ancestral rites, the son of\r\nMarius killed a tribune with his own hands, sending his head to the\r\nconsuls, and hurled another from the Capitol,--a fate which had never\r\nbefallen such an official,--and debarred two praetors from both fire\r\nand water.

The lieutenant of Flaccus, Fimbria, when\r\nhis chief had reached Byzantium revolted against him. He was in all\r\nmatters very bold and reckless, passionately fond of any notoriety\r\nwhatsoever and contemptuous of all that was superior. This led him at\r\nthat time, after his departure from Rome, to pretend an\r\nincorruptibility in respect to money and an interest in the soldiers,\r\nwhich bound them to him and set them at variance with Flaccus. He was\r\nthe more able to do this because Flaccus was insatiable in regard to\r\nmoney, not being content to appropriate what was ordinarily left over,\r\nbut enriching himself even from the soldiers' allowance for food and\r\nfrom the booty, which he invariably maintained belonged to him.\r\n(Valesius, p. 650.)\r\n\r\n2. (Par.) When Flaccus and Fimbria had arrived at Byzantium and Flaccus\r\nafter commanding them to bivouac outside the wall had gone into the\r\ncity, Fimbria seized the occasion to accuse him of having taken\r\nmoney, and denounced him, saying that he was living in luxury within,\r\nwhereas they were enduring hardships under the shelter of tents, in\r\nstorm and cold. The soldiers then angrily rushed into the city, killed\r\nsome of those that fell upon them and scattered to the various houses.\r\n(Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n3. (Par.) On the occasion of some dispute between Fimbria and the\r\nquaestor Flaccus threatened to send him back to Rome whether he liked\r\nit or not, and when the other consequently made some abusive reply\r\ndeprived him of his command. Fimbria set out upon his return with the\r\nworst possible will and on reaching the soldiers at Byzantium greeted\r\nthem as if he were upon the point of departure, asked for a letter,\r\nand lamented his fate, pretending to have suffered undeservedly. He\r\nadvised them to remember the help he had given them and to be on their\r\nguard; and his words contained a hidden reference to Flaccus, implying\r\nthat he had designs upon them. Finding that they accepted his story\r\nand were well disposed toward him and suspicious of the general, he\r\nwent on still further and incited them to anger by accusing Flaccus of\r\nvarious faults, finally stating that he would betray them for money;\r\nhence the soldiers drove away Thermus, who had been assigned to take\r\ncharge of them. (Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n4. (Par.) Fimbria destroyed many men not to serve the best ends of\r\njustice nor to secure the greatest benefit to Rome but through bad\r\ntemper and lust of slaughter. A proof is that he once ordered many\r\ncrosses to be made, to which he was wont to bind them and wear out\r\ntheir lives by cruel treatment, and then when these were found to\r\nbe many more than those who were to be put to death he commanded\r\nsome of the bystanders to be arrested and affixed to the crosses\r\nthat were in excess, that they might not seem to have been made in\r\nvain. (Valesius, p. 653.)\r\n\r\n5. (Par.) The same man on capturing Ilium despatched as many persons as\r\nhe could, sparing none, and all but burned the whole city to the ground.\r\nHe took the place not by storm but by guile. After bestowing some\r\npraise on them for the embassy sent to Sulla and saying that it made\r\nno difference with which one of the two they ratified a truce (for he\r\nand Sulla were both Romans) he thereupon went in among them as among\r\nfriends and performed these deeds. (Valesius, ib.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. CII] [Sidenote: B.C. 85 (_a.u._ 669)] 1. (Par.)\r\nMetellus after being defeated by Cinna went to Sulla and was of the\r\ngreatest assistance to him. For in view of his reputation for justice\r\nand piety not a few who were opposed to Sulla's policy decided that it\r\nwas not without reason that Metellus had joined him but that he chose\r\nwhat was really juster and more advantageous for the country, and hence\r\nthey went over to their side. (Valesius, p. 653.)\r\n\r\n2. (Par.) A thunderbolt fell upon the Capitol, causing the destruction\r\nof the Sibylline books and of many other things. (Mai, p. 551.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG.

Indignant at those who held the city he proceeded\r\nabsolutely alone to Picenum before he had quite yet come to man's\r\nestate: from the inhabitants on account of his father's position of\r\ncommand he collected a small band and set up an individual\r\nsovereignty, thinking to perform some famous exploit by himself; then\r\nhe joined the party of Sulla. Beginning in this way he became no less\r\na man than his chief, but, as his title indicates, grew to be \"Great.\"\r\n(Valesius, p. 653.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. CIV] [Sidenote: B.C. 82 (_a.u._ 672)] (Par.) Sulla\r\ndelivered the army to a man[67] who was in no wise distinguished[68]\r\nnor generally commended, in spite of the fact that he had many who had\r\nbeen with him from the beginning superior in both experience and\r\naction, whom up to that time he had employed in all emergencies and\r\ntreated as most faithful. Before he became victor he was accustomed to\r\nmake requests of them and use their assistance to the fullest extent.\r\nBut as he drew near his dream of absolute dominion, he made no account\r\nof them any longer but reposed his trust rather in the basest men who\r\nwere not conspicuous for family or possessed of a reputation for\r\nuprightness. The reason was that he saw that such persons were ready\r\nto assist him in all his projects, even the vilest; and he thought\r\nthey would be most grateful to him if they should obtain even very\r\nsmall favors, would never show contempt nor lay claim to either his\r\ndeeds or his plans. The virtuous element, on the other hand, would not\r\nbe willing to help him in his evil-doing but would even rebuke him;\r\nthey would demand rewards for benefits conferred, according to merit,\r\nwould feel no gratitude for them but take them as something due, and\r\nwould claim his actions and counsels as their own. (Valesius, p. 654.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 67: _Q. Lucretius Ofella._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 68: Supplying [Greek: met' epiphanei], with Reiske.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. CV] 1. (Par.) Sulla up to that day that he conquered\r\nthe Samnites had been a conspicuous figure, possessing a renown from\r\nhis leadership and plans, and was believed to be most devoted to\r\nhumaneness and piety, so that all thought that he had Fortune as an\r\nally because of his excellence. After this event he changed so much\r\nthat one would not say his earlier and his later deeds were those of\r\nthe same person. This probably shows that he could not endure good\r\nfortune. Acts that he censured in other persons while he was still\r\nweak, and others, far more outrageous even, he committed: it had\r\npresumably always been his wish to do so, but he had been hindered by\r\nlack of opportunity. This fact produced a strong conviction in the\r\nminds of some that bad luck has not a little to do with creating a\r\nreputation for virtue.[69] As soon as Sulla had vanquished the\r\nSamnites and thought he had put an end to the war (the rest of it he\r\nheld of no account) he changed his tactics and, as it were, left his\r\nformer personality behind outside the wall and in the battle, and\r\nproceeded to surpass Cinna and Marius and all their associates\r\ncombined. Treatment that he had given to no one of the foreign peoples\r\nthat had opposed him he bestowed upon his native land, as if he had\r\nsubdued that as well. In the first place he sent forthwith the heads\r\nof Damasippus and the members of his party stuck on poles to Praeneste,\r\nand many of those who voluntarily surrendered he killed as if he had\r\ncaught them without their consent. The next day he ordered the\r\nsenators to assemble at the temple of Bellona, giving them the idea\r\nthat he would make some defence of his conduct, and ordered those\r\ncaptured alive to meet at the so-called \"public\" field,[70] pretending\r\nthat he would enroll them in the lists. This last class he had other\r\nmen slay, and many persons from the city, mixed in among them,\r\nlikewise perished: to the senators he himself at the same time\r\naddressed a most bitter speech. (Valesius, p. 654.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 69: Adopting Reiske's suggestion for filling out a lacuna in\r\nthe sense.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 70: The _villa publica_.]\r\n\r\n2. (Par.) The massacre of the captured persons was going on even under\r\nSulla's direction with unabated fury, and as they were being killed\r\nnear the temple the great uproar and lamentation that they made, their\r\nshrieks and wails, invaded the senate-house, so that the senate was\r\nterrified for two reasons. The second of the two was that they were\r\nnot far from expecting that they themselves, also, might yet suffer\r\nsome terrible injury, so unholy were both his words and his actions:\r\ntherefore many, cut to the heart with grief at the thought of reality\r\nand possibility, wished that they themselves belonged to the number of\r\nmen already dead outside, and so might secure a respite at last from\r\nfear. Their cases, however, were postponed, while the rest were\r\nslaughtered and thrown into the river, so that the savagery of\r\nMithridates, deemed so terrible, in slaughtering all the Romans in\r\nAsia in one day, was now held to be of slight importance in comparison\r\nwith the number massacred and their manner of death. Nor did the\r\nterror stop here, but the slaughters which began at this point as if\r\nby a kind of signal occurred in the country district and all the\r\ncities of Italy. Toward many Sulla himself showed hatred and toward\r\nmany others his companions did the same, some truthfully and some in\r\npretence, in order that displaying by the similarity of their deeds a\r\ncharacter similar to his and establishing him as their friend they\r\nmight not, by any dissimilarity, incur suspicion, seem to be reproving\r\nhim at all, and so endanger themselves. They murdered all whom they\r\nsaw to surpass them either in wealth or in any other respect, some\r\nthrough envy and others on account of their possessions. For under\r\nsuch conditions many neutral persons even, though they might have\r\ntaken neither side, became subject to some private complaint, as\r\nsurpassing some one in excellence or wealth and family. No safety was\r\nvisible for any one against those in power who wished to commit an\r\ninjustice in any case. (Valesius, p. 657.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: B.C. 81 (_a.u._ 673)] 3. (Par.) Such calamities held Rome\r\nencompassed. Who could narrate the insults to the living, many of\r\nwhich were offered to women, and many to the noblest and most\r\nprominent children, as if they were captives in war? Yet those acts,\r\nthough most distressing, yet at least in their similarity to others\r\nthat had previously taken place seemed endurable to such persons as\r\nwere away from them. But Sulla was not satisfied, nor was he content\r\nto do the same as others: a certain longing came over him to far excel\r\nall in the variety of his slaughters, as if there were some virtue in\r\nbeing second to none even in bloodguiltiness, and so he exposed to\r\nview a new device, a whitened tablet, on which he inscribed the names.\r\nNotwithstanding this all previous atrocities continued undiminished,\r\nand not even those whose names were not inscribed on the tablets were\r\nin safety. For many, some living and others actually dead, had their\r\nnames subsequently inscribed at the pleasure of the slayers, so that\r\nin this aspect the phenomenon exhibited no novelties, and equally by\r\nits terror and its absurdity distressed absolutely every one. The\r\ntablets were exposed like some register of senators or list of\r\nsoldiers approved, and all those passing by at one time or another ran\r\neagerly to it in crowds, with the idea that it contained some\r\nfavorable announcement: then many found relatives' names and some,\r\nindeed, their own inscribed for death, whereupon their condition,\r\noverwhelmed by such a sudden disaster, was a terrible one; many of\r\nthem, making themselves known by their behavior, perished. There was\r\nno particle of safety for any one outside of Sulla's company. For\r\nwhether a man approached the tablets, he incurred censure for meddling\r\nwith matters not concerning him, or if he did not approach he was\r\nregarded as a malcontent. The man who read the list through or asked\r\nany question about anything inscribed became suspected of enquiring\r\nabout himself or his companions, and the one who did not read or\r\nenquire was suspected of being displeased at it and for that reason\r\nincurred hatred. Tears or laughter proved fatal on the instant: hence\r\nmany were destroyed not because they had said or done anything\r\nforbidden, but because they either drew a long face or smiled. Their\r\nattitudes were so carefully observed as this, and it was possible for\r\nno one either to mourn or to exult over an enemy, but even the latter\r\nclass were slaughtered on the ground that they were jeering at\r\nsomething. Furthermore many found trouble in their very names, for\r\nsome who were unacquainted with the proscribed applied their names to\r\nwhomsoever they pleased, and thus many perished in the place of\r\nothers. This resulted in great confusion, some naming any man they met\r\njust as ever they pleased, and the others denying that they were so\r\ncalled. Some were slaughtered while still ignorant of the fact that\r\nthey were to die, and others, who had been previously informed,\r\nanywhere that they happened to be; and there was no place for them\r\neither holy or sacred, no safe retreat, no refuge. Some, to be sure,\r\nby perishing suddenly before learning of the catastrophe hanging over\r\nthem, and some at the moment they received the news, were fortunately\r\nrelieved of the terrors preceding death: those who were warned in\r\nadvance and hid themselves found it a very difficult matter to escape.\r\nThey did not dare to withdraw, for fear of being detected, nor could\r\nthey endure to remain where they were for fear of betrayal. Very many\r\nof them were betrayed by their associates and those dearest to them,\r\nand so perished. Consequently not those whose names were inscribed\r\nmerely, but the rest, as well, suffered in anticipation. (Valesius,\r\npp. 658-662.)\r\n\r\n4. (Par.) The heads of all those slaughtered in any place were brought\r\nto the Roman Forum and exposed on the rostra, so that as often as\r\nproscriptions were issued, so often did the heads appear. (Valesius,\r\nib.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. CVI] [Sidenote: B.C. 74 (_a.u._ 680)] Lucullus said\r\nthat he would rather have rescued one Roman from danger than have\r\ncaptured at one stroke all the forces of the enemy. (Mai, p. 551.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. CVII] 1. For titles do not change the characters of\r\nmen, but one makes titles take on new meanings according to one's\r\nmanagement of affairs. Many monarchs are the source of blessings to\r\ntheir subjects,--wherefore such a state is called a kingdom,--whereas\r\nmany who live under a democracy work innumerable evils to themselves.\r\n(Mai, p. 556. Cp. Frag. XII.)\r\n\r\n2. For nothing leads on an army or anything else requiring some\r\ncontrol to better or worse like the character and habits of the person\r\npresiding over it. The disposition and character of their leaders the\r\nmajority imitate, and they do whatever they see them doing, some from\r\nreal inclination, and others as a mere pretence. (Mai, p. 556.)\r\n\r\n3. The subservient element is wont ever to shape itself according to\r\nthe disposition of its rulers. (Mai, p. 560, from Antonius Melissa, p.\r\n78, ed. Tigur.)\r\n\r\n4. For who would not prefer to be upright and at his death to lie in\r\nthe bosom of the State, rather than to behold her devastated? (Mai, p.\r\n557.)\r\n\r\n5. If any one were building a house for you where you were not going\r\nto remain, you would think the undertaking a loss: do you now wish to\r\ngrow rich in that place from which you must depart repeatedly before\r\nevening? (Mai, ib.)\r\n\r\n6. Do you not know that we tarry in others' domains just like\r\nstrangers and sojourners? Do you not know that it is the lot of\r\nsojourners to be driven out when they are not expecting or looking for\r\nit? That is our case. (Mai, ib.)\r\n\r\n7. Who would not choose to die from one blow, and that with no pain or\r\nvery little, instead of after sickness? Who would not pray to depart\r\nfrom a sound body with sound spirits rather than to rot with some\r\ndecay or dropsy, or wither away in hunger? (Mai, ib.)\r\n\r\n8. Things hoped for that fail of realization are wont to grieve some\r\npersons more than the loss of things never expected at all. They\r\nregard the latter as far from them and so pursue them less, as if they\r\nbelonged to others, whereas the former they approach closely, and\r\ngrieve for them as if deprived of rightful possessions. (Mai, p. 558.)\r\n\r\n9. Expectation of danger, without danger, puts the person expecting in\r\nthe position of having made things secure beforehand through imagining\r\nsome coming unpleasantness. (Mai, p. 560, from Antonius Melissa.)\r\n\r\n10. To be elated by good fortune is like running the stadium race on a\r\nslippery course. (Mai, ib., also from Antonius.)\r\n\r\n11. The same author [i.e., Dio the Roman] said: \"Is it not an outrage\r\nto trouble the gods, when we ourselves are not willing to do what the\r\ngods deem to be in our power?\" (Mai, p. 561, from the Anthology of\r\nArsenius.)\r\n\r\n12. The same said: \"It is much better to win some success and be\r\nenvied than to fail and be pitied.\" (Mai, ib., from Arsenius.)\r\n\r\n13. The same said: \"It is impossible for any one who acts contrary to\r\nright principles to derive any benefit from them.\" (Mai, p. 562.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRAG. CVIII] [Sidenote: B.C. 70 (_a.u._ 684)] The Cretans\r\nsent an embassy to the Romans, hoping to renew the old truce and\r\nfurthermore to obtain some kindness for their preservation of the\r\nquaestor and his fellow soldiers. But they, rather imbued with anger at\r\ntheir failure to overcome the Cretans than grateful to the enemy for\r\nnot having destroyed them, made no reasonable answer and demanded back\r\nfrom them all the captives and deserters. They demanded hostages and\r\nlarge sums of money, required the largest ships and the chief men to\r\nbe given up, and would not wait for an answer from the envoys' country\r\nbut sent out one of the consuls immediately to take possession of\r\nthose things and make war upon them if they failed to give,--as proved\r\nto be the case. For the men who at the outset, before any such demand\r\nwas made and before they had conquered, had refused to make terms\r\nwould naturally not endure after their victory the imposition of\r\nexorbitant demands of such a character. The Romans knowing this\r\nclearly and suspecting further that the envoys would try to corrupt\r\nsome persons with money, so as to hinder the expedition, voted in the\r\nsenate that no one should lend them anything.
