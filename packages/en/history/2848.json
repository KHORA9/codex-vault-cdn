Those who undertake to write histories, do not, I perceive, take that\r\ntrouble on one and the same account, but for many reasons, and those\r\nsuch as are very different one from another. For some of them apply\r\nthemselves to this part of learning to show their skill in composition,\r\nand that they may therein acquire a reputation for speaking finely:\r\nothers of them there are, who write histories in order to gratify those\r\nthat happen to be concerned in them, and on that account have spared no\r\npains, but rather gone beyond their own abilities in the performance:\r\nbut others there are, who, of necessity and by force, are driven to\r\nwrite history, because they are concerned in the facts, and so cannot\r\nexcuse themselves from committing them to writing, for the advantage of\r\nposterity; nay, there are not a few who are induced to draw their\r\nhistorical facts out of darkness into light, and to produce them for the\r\nbenefit of the public, on account of the great importance of the facts\r\nthemselves with which they have been concerned. Now of these several\r\nreasons for writing history, I must profess the two last were my own\r\nreasons also; for since I was myself interested in that war which we\r\nJews had with the Romans, and knew myself its particular actions, and\r\nwhat conclusion it had, I was forced to give the history of it, because\r\nI saw that others perverted the truth of those actions in their\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\n2. Now I have undertaken the present work, as thinking it will appear to\r\nall the Greeks 2 worthy of their study; for it will contain all our\r\nantiquities, and the constitution of our government, as interpreted out\r\nof the Hebrew Scriptures. And indeed I did formerly intend, when I wrote\r\nof the war, 3 to explain who the Jews originally were,—what fortunes\r\nthey had been subject to,—and by what legislature they had been\r\ninstructed in piety, and the exercise of other virtues,—what wars also\r\nthey had made in remote ages, till they were unwillingly engaged in this\r\nlast with the Romans: but because this work would take up a great\r\ncompass, I separated it into a set treatise by itself, with a beginning\r\nof its own, and its own conclusion; but in process of time, as usually\r\nhappens to such as undertake great things, I grew weary and went on\r\nslowly, it being a large subject, and a difficult thing to translate our\r\nhistory into a foreign, and to us unaccustomed language. However, some\r\npersons there were who desired to know our history, and so exhorted me\r\nto go on with it; and, above all the rest, Epaphroditus, 4 a man who is\r\na lover of all kind of learning, but is principally delighted with the\r\nknowledge of history, and this on account of his having been himself\r\nconcerned in great affairs, and many turns of fortune, and having shown\r\na wonderful rigor of an excellent nature, and an immovable virtuous\r\nresolution in them all. I yielded to this man's persuasions, who always\r\nexcites such as have abilities in what is useful and acceptable, to join\r\ntheir endeavors with his. I was also ashamed myself to permit any\r\nlaziness of disposition to have a greater influence upon me, than the\r\ndelight of taking pains in such studies as were very useful: I thereupon\r\nstirred up myself, and went on with my work more cheerfully. Besides the\r\nforegoing motives, I had others which I greatly reflected on; and these\r\nwere, that our forefathers were willing to communicate such things to\r\nothers; and that some of the Greeks took considerable pains to know the\r\naffairs of our nation.\r\n\r\n3. I found, therefore, that the second of the Ptolemies was a king who\r\nwas extraordinarily diligent in what concerned learning, and the\r\ncollection of books; that he was also peculiarly ambitious to procure a\r\ntranslation of our law, and of the constitution of our government\r\ntherein contained, into the Greek tongue. Now Eleazar the high priest,\r\none not inferior to any other of that dignity among us, did not envy the\r\nforenamed king the participation of that advantage, which otherwise he\r\nwould for certain have denied him, but that he knew the custom of our\r\nnation was, to hinder nothing of what we esteemed ourselves from being\r\ncommunicated to others. Accordingly, I thought it became me both to\r\nimitate the generosity of our high priest, and to suppose there might\r\neven now be many lovers of learning like the king; for he did not obtain\r\nall our writings at that time; but those who were sent to Alexandria as\r\ninterpreters, gave him only the books of the law, while there were a\r\nvast number of other matters in our sacred books. They, indeed, contain\r\nin them the history of five thousand years; in which time happened many\r\nstrange accidents, many chances of war, and great actions of the\r\ncommanders, and mutations of the form of our government. Upon the whole,\r\na man that will peruse this history, may principally learn from it, that\r\nall events succeed well, even to an incredible degree, and the reward of\r\nfelicity is proposed by God; but then it is to those that follow his\r\nwill, and do not venture to break his excellent laws: and that so far as\r\nmen any way apostatize from the accurate observation of them, what was\r\npractical before becomes impracticable 5 and whatsoever they set about\r\nas a good thing, is converted into an incurable calamity. And now I\r\nexhort all those that peruse these books, to apply their minds to God;\r\nand to examine the mind of our legislator, whether he hath not\r\nunderstood his nature in a manner worthy of him; and hath not ever\r\nascribed to him such operations as become his power, and hath not\r\npreserved his writings from those indecent fables which others have\r\nframed, although, by the great distance of time when he lived, he might\r\nhave securely forged such lies; for he lived two thousand years ago; at\r\nwhich vast distance of ages the poets themselves have not been so hardy\r\nas to fix even the generations of their gods, much less the actions of\r\ntheir men, or their own laws. As I proceed, therefore, I shall\r\naccurately describe what is contained in our records, in the order of\r\ntime that belongs to them; for I have already promised so to do\r\nthroughout this undertaking; and this without adding any thing to what\r\nis therein contained, or taking away any thing therefrom.\r\n\r\n4. But because almost all our constitution depends on the wisdom of\r\nMoses, our legislator, I cannot avoid saying somewhat concerning him\r\nbeforehand, though I shall do it briefly; I mean, because otherwise\r\nthose that read my book may wonder how it comes to pass, that my\r\ndiscourse, which promises an account of laws and historical facts,\r\ncontains so much of philosophy. The reader is therefore to know, that\r\nMoses deemed it exceeding necessary, that he who would conduct his own\r\nlife well, and give laws to others, in the first place should consider\r\nthe Divine nature; and, upon the contemplation of God's operations,\r\nshould thereby imitate the best of all patterns, so far as it is\r\npossible for human nature to do, and to endeavor to follow after it:\r\nneither could the legislator himself have a right mind without such a\r\ncontemplation; nor would any thing he should write tend to the promotion\r\nof virtue in his readers; I mean, unless they be taught first of all,\r\nthat God is the Father and Lord of all things, and sees all things, and\r\nthat thence he bestows a happy life upon those that follow him; but\r\nplunges such as do not walk in the paths of virtue into inevitable\r\nmiseries. Now when Moses was desirous to teach this lesson to his\r\ncountrymen, he did not begin the establishment of his laws after the\r\nsame manner that other legislators did; I mean, upon contracts and other\r\nrights between one man and another, but by raising their minds upwards\r\nto regard God, and his creation of the world; and by persuading them,\r\nthat we men are the most excellent of the creatures of God upon earth.\r\nNow when once he had brought them to submit to religion, he easily\r\npersuaded them to submit in all other things: for as to other\r\nlegislators, they followed fables, and by their discourses transferred\r\nthe most reproachful of human vices unto the gods, and afforded wicked\r\nmen the most plausible excuses for their crimes; but as for our\r\nlegislator, when he had once demonstrated that God was possessed of\r\nperfect virtue, he supposed that men also ought to strive after the\r\nparticipation of it; and on those who did not so think, and so believe,\r\nhe inflicted the severest punishments. I exhort, therefore, my readers\r\nto examine this whole undertaking in that view; for thereby it will\r\nappear to them, that there is nothing therein disagreeable either to the\r\nmajesty of God, or to his love to mankind; for all things have here a\r\nreference to the nature of the universe; while our legislator speaks\r\nsome things wisely, but enigmatically, and others under a decent\r\nallegory, but still explains such things as required a direct\r\nexplication plainly and expressly. However, those that have a mind to\r\nknow the reasons of every thing, may find here a very curious\r\nphilosophical theory, which I now indeed shall wave the explication of;\r\nbut if God afford me time for it, I will set about writing it 6 after I\r\nhave finished the present work. I shall now betake myself to the history\r\nbefore me, after I have first mentioned what Moses says of the creation\r\nof the world, which I find described in the sacred books after the\r\nmanner following.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ This preface of Josephus is excellent in its kind, and\r\nhighly worthy the repeated perusal of the reader, before he set about\r\nthe perusal of the work itself.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ That is, all the Gentiles, both Greeks and Romans.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ We may seasonably note here, that Josephus wrote his Seven\r\nBooks of the Jewish War long before he wrote these his Antiquities.\r\nThose books of the War were published about A.D. 75, and these\r\nAntiquities, A.

Containing The Interval Of Three Thousand Eight Hundred And\r\nThirty-Three Years. — From The Creation To The Death Of Isaac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. The Constitution Of The World And The Disposition Of The\r\nElements.\r\n\r\n1. In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. But when the\r\nearth did not come into sight, but was covered with thick darkness, and\r\na wind moved upon its surface, God commanded that there should be light:\r\nand when that was made, he considered the whole mass, and separated the\r\nlight and the darkness; and the name he gave to one was Night, and the\r\nother he called Day: and he named the beginning of light, and the time\r\nof rest, The Evening and The Morning, and this was indeed the first day.\r\nBut Moses said it was one day; the cause of which I am able to give even\r\nnow; but because I have promised to give such reasons for all things in\r\na treatise by itself, I shall put off its exposition till that time.\r\nAfter this, on the second day, he placed the heaven over the whole\r\nworld, and separated it from the other parts, and he determined it\r\nshould stand by itself. He also placed a crystalline [firmament] round\r\nit, and put it together in a manner agreeable to the earth, and fitted\r\nit for giving moisture and rain, and for affording the advantage of\r\ndews. On the third day he appointed the dry land to appear, with the sea\r\nitself round about it; and on the very same day he made the plants and\r\nthe seeds to spring out of the earth. On the fourth day he adorned the\r\nheaven with the sun, the moon, and the other stars, and appointed them\r\ntheir motions and courses, that the vicissitudes of the seasons might be\r\nclearly signified. And on the fifth day he produced the living\r\ncreatures, both those that swim, and those that fly; the former in the\r\nsea, the latter in the air: he also sorted them as to society and\r\nmixture, for procreation, and that their kinds might increase and\r\nmultiply. On the sixth day he created the four-footed beasts, and made\r\nthem male and female: on the same day he also formed man. Accordingly\r\nMoses says, That in just six days the world, and all that is therein,\r\nwas made. And that the seventh day was a rest, and a release from the\r\nlabor of such operations; whence it is that we Celebrate a rest from our\r\nlabors on that day, and call it the Sabbath, which word denotes rest in\r\nthe Hebrew tongue.\r\n\r\n2. Moreover, Moses, after the seventh day was over1 begins to talk\r\nphilosophically; and concerning the formation of man, says thus: That\r\nGod took dust from the ground, and formed man, and inserted in him a\r\nspirit and a soul.2 This man was called Adam, which in the Hebrew tongue\r\nsignifies one that is red, because he was formed out of red earth,\r\ncompounded together; for of that kind is virgin and true earth. God also\r\npresented the living creatures, when he had made them, according to\r\ntheir kinds, both male and female, to Adam, who gave them those names by\r\nwhich they are still called. But when he saw that Adam had no female\r\ncompanion, no society, for there was no such created, and that he\r\nwondered at the other animals which were male and female, he laid him\r\nasleep, and took away one of his ribs, and out of it formed the woman;\r\nwhereupon Adam knew her when she was brought to him, and acknowledged\r\nthat she was made out of himself. Now a woman is called in the Hebrew\r\ntongue Issa; but the name of this woman was Eve, which signifies the\r\nmother of all living.\r\n\r\n3. Moses says further, that God planted a paradise in the east,\r\nflourishing with all sorts of trees; and that among them was the tree of\r\nlife, and another of knowledge, whereby was to be known what was good\r\nand evil; and that when he brought Adam and his wife into this garden,\r\nhe commanded them to take care of the plants. Now the garden was watered\r\nby one river,3 which ran round about the whole earth, and was parted\r\ninto four parts. And Phison, which denotes a multitude, running into\r\nIndia, makes its exit into the sea, and is by the Greeks called Ganges.\r\nEuphrates also, as well as Tigris, goes down into the Red Sea.4 Now the\r\nname Euphrates, or Phrath, denotes either a dispersion, or a flower: by\r\nTiris, or Diglath, is signified what is swift, with narrowness; and Geon\r\nruns through Egypt, and denotes what arises from the east, which the\r\nGreeks call Nile.\r\n\r\n4. God therefore commanded that Adam and his wife should eat of all the\r\nrest of the plants, but to abstain from the tree of knowledge; and\r\nforetold to them, that if they touched it, it would prove their\r\ndestruction. But while all the living creatures had one language, 5 at\r\nthat time the serpent, which then lived together with Adam and his wife,\r\nshewed an envious disposition, at his supposal of their living happily,\r\nand in obedience to the commands of God; and imagining, that when they\r\ndisobeyed them, they would fall into calamities, he persuaded the woman,\r\nout of a malicious intention, to taste of the tree of knowledge, telling\r\nthem, that in that tree was the knowledge of good and evil; which\r\nknowledge, when they should obtain, they would lead a happy life; nay, a\r\nlife not inferior to that of a god: by which means he overcame the\r\nwoman, and persuaded her to despise the command of God. Now when she had\r\ntasted of that tree, and was pleased with its fruit, she persuaded Adam\r\nto make use of it also. Upon this they perceived that they were become\r\nnaked to one another; and being ashamed thus to appear abroad, they\r\ninvented somewhat to cover them; for the tree sharpened their\r\nunderstanding; and they covered themselves with fig-leaves; and tying\r\nthese before them, out of modesty, they thought they were happier than\r\nthey were before, as they had discovered what they were in want of. But\r\nwhen God came into the garden, Adam, who was wont before to come and\r\nconverse with him, being conscious of his wicked behavior, went out of\r\nthe way. This behavior surprised God; and he asked what was the cause of\r\nthis his procedure; and why he, that before delighted in that\r\nconversation, did now fly from it, and avoid it. When he made no reply,\r\nas conscious to himself that he had transgressed the command of God, God\r\nsaid, \"I had before determined about you both, how you might lead a\r\nhappy life, without any affliction, and care, and vexation of soul; and\r\nthat all things which might contribute to your enjoyment and pleasure\r\nshould grow up by my providence, of their own accord, without your own\r\nlabor and pains-taking; which state of labor and pains-taking would soon\r\nbring on old age, and death would not be at any remote distance: but now\r\nthou hast abused this my good-will, and hast disobeyed my commands; for\r\nthy silence is not the sign of thy virtue, but of thy evil conscience.\"\r\nHowever, Adam excused his sin, and entreated God not to be angry at him,\r\nand laid the blame of what was done upon his wife; and said that he was\r\ndeceived by her, and thence became an offender; while she again accused\r\nthe serpent. But God allotted him punishment, because he weakly\r\nsubmitted to the counsel of his wife; and said the ground should not\r\nhenceforth yield its fruits of its own accord, but that when it should\r\nbe harassed by their labor, it should bring forth some of its fruits,\r\nand refuse to bring forth others. He also made Eve liable to the\r\ninconveniency of breeding, and the sharp pains of bringing forth\r\nchildren; and this because she persuaded Adam with the same arguments\r\nwherewith the serpent had persuaded her, and had thereby brought him\r\ninto a calamitous condition. He also deprived the serpent of speech, out\r\nof indignation at his malicious disposition towards Adam. Besides this,\r\nhe inserted poison under his tongue, and made him an enemy to men; and\r\nsuggested to them, that they should direct their strokes against his\r\nhead, that being the place wherein lay his mischievous designs towards\r\nmen, and it being easiest to take vengeance on him, that way. And when\r\nhe had deprived him of the use of his feet, he made him to go rolling\r\nall along, and dragging himself upon the ground. And when God had\r\nappointed these penalties for them, he removed Adam and Eve out of the\r\ngarden into another place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. Concerning The Posterity Of Adam, And The Ten Generations\r\nFrom Him To The Deluge.\r\n\r\n1. Adam and Eve had two sons: the elder of them was named Cain; which\r\nname, when it is interpreted, signifies a possession: the younger was\r\nAbel, which signifies sorrow. They had also daughters. Now the two\r\nbrethren were pleased with different courses of life: for Abel, the\r\nyounger, was a lover of righteousness; and believing that God was\r\npresent at all his actions, he excelled in virtue; and his employment\r\nwas that of a shepherd. But Cain was not only very wicked in other\r\nrespects, but was wholly intent upon getting; and he first contrived to\r\nplough the ground. He slew his brother on the occasion following:—They\r\nhad resolved to sacrifice to God. Now Cain brought the fruits of the\r\nearth, and of his husbandry; but Abel brought milk, and the first-fruits\r\nof his flocks: but God was more delighted with the latter oblation,6\r\nwhen he was honored with what grew naturally of its own accord, than he\r\nwas with what was the invention of a covetous man, and gotten by forcing\r\nthe ground; whence it was that Cain was very angry that Abel was\r\npreferred by God before him; and he slew his brother, and hid his dead\r\nbody, thinking to escape discovery. But God, knowing what had been done,\r\ncame to Cain, and asked him what was become of his brother, because he\r\nhad not seen him of many days; whereas he used to observe them\r\nconversing together at other times. But Cain was in doubt with himself,\r\nand knew not what answer to give to God. At first he said that he was\r\nhimself at a loss about his brother's disappearing; but when he was\r\nprovoked by God, who pressed him vehemently, as resolving to know what\r\nthe matter was, he replied, he was not his brother's guardian or keeper,\r\nnor was he an observer of what he did. But, in return, God convicted\r\nCain, as having been the murderer of his brother; and said, \"I wonder at\r\nthee, that thou knowest not what is become of a man whom thou thyself\r\nhast destroyed.\" God therefore did not inflict the punishment [of death]\r\nupon him, on account of his offering sacrifice, and thereby making\r\nsupplication to him not to be extreme in his wrath to him; but he made\r\nhim accursed, and threatened his posterity in the seventh generation. He\r\nalso cast him, together with his wife, out of that land. And when he was\r\nafraid that in wandering about he should fall among Wild beasts, and by\r\nthat means perish, God bid him not to entertain such a melancholy\r\nsuspicion, and to go over all the earth without fear of what mischief he\r\nmight suffer from wild beasts; and setting a mark upon him, that he\r\nmight be known, he commanded him to depart.\r\n\r\n2. And when Cain had traveled over many countries, he, with his wife,\r\nbuilt a city, named Nod, which is a place so called, and there he\r\nsettled his abode; where also he had children. However, he did not\r\naccept of his punishment in order to amendment, but to increase his\r\nwickedness; for he only aimed to procure every thing that was for his\r\nown bodily pleasure, though it obliged him to be injurious to his\r\nneighbors. He augmented his household substance with much wealth, by\r\nrapine and violence; he excited his acquaintance to procure pleasures\r\nand spoils by robbery, and became a great leader of men into wicked\r\ncourses. He also introduced a change in that way of simplicity wherein\r\nmen lived before; and was the author of measures and weights. And\r\nwhereas they lived innocently and generously while they knew nothing of\r\nsuch arts, he changed the world into cunning craftiness. He first of all\r\nset boundaries about lands: he built a city, and fortified it with\r\nwalls, and he compelled his family to come together to it; and called\r\nthat city Enoch, after the name of his eldest son Enoch. Now Jared was\r\nthe son of Enoch; whose son was Malaliel; whose son was Mathusela; whose\r\nson was Lamech; who had seventy-seven children by two wives, Silla and\r\nAda. Of those children by Ada, one was Jabal: he erected tents, and\r\nloved the life of a shepherd. But Jubal, who was born of the same mother\r\nwith him, exercised himself in music;7 and invented the psaltery and the\r\nharp. But Tubal, one of his children by the other wife, exceeded all men\r\nin strength, and was very expert and famous in martial performances. He\r\nprocured what tended to the pleasures of the body by that method; and\r\nfirst of all invented the art of making brass. Lamech was also the\r\nfather of a daughter, whose name was Naamah. And because he was so\r\nskillful in matters of divine revelation, that he knew he was to be\r\npunished for Cain's murder of his brother, he made that known to his\r\nwives. Nay, even while Adam was alive, it came to pass that the\r\nposterity of Cain became exceeding wicked, every one successively dying,\r\none after another, more wicked than the former. They were intolerable in\r\nwar, and vehement in robberies; and if any one were slow to murder\r\npeople, yet was he bold in his profligate behavior, in acting unjustly,\r\nand doing injuries for gain.\r\n\r\n3. Now Adam, who was the first man, and made out of the earth, [for our\r\ndiscourse must now be about him,] after Abel was slain, and Cain fled\r\naway, on account of his murder, was solicitous for posterity, and had a\r\nvehement desire of children, he being two hundred and thirty years old;\r\nafter which time he lived other seven hundred, and then died. He had\r\nindeed many other children,8 but Seth in particular. As for the rest, it\r\nwould be tedious to name them; I will therefore only endeavor to give an\r\naccount of those that proceeded from Seth. Now this Seth, when he was\r\nbrought up, and came to those years in which he could discern what was\r\ngood, became a virtuous man; and as he was himself of an excellent\r\ncharacter, so did he leave children behind him who imitated his\r\nvirtues.9 All these proved to be of good dispositions. They also\r\ninhabited the same country without dissensions, and in a happy\r\ncondition, without any misfortunes falling upon them, till they died.\r\nThey also were the inventors of that peculiar sort of wisdom which is\r\nconcerned with the heavenly bodies, and their order. And that their\r\ninventions might not be lost before they were sufficiently known, upon\r\nAdam's prediction that the world was to be destroyed at one time by the\r\nforce of fire, and at another time by the violence and quantity of\r\nwater, they made two pillars, 10 the one of brick, the other of stone:\r\nthey inscribed their discoveries on them both, that in case the pillar\r\nof brick should be destroyed by the flood, the pillar of stone might\r\nremain, and exhibit those discoveries to mankind; and also inform them\r\nthat there was another pillar of brick erected by them. Now this remains\r\nin the land of Siriad to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. Concerning The Flood; And After What Manner Noah Was Saved In\r\nAn Ark, With His Kindred, And Afterwards Dwelt In The Plain Of Shinar.\r\n\r\n1. Now this posterity of Seth continued to esteem God as the Lord of the\r\nuniverse, and to have an entire regard to virtue, for seven generations;\r\nbut in process of time they were perverted, and forsook the practices of\r\ntheir forefathers; and did neither pay those honors to God which were\r\nappointed them, nor had they any concern to do justice towards men. But\r\nfor what degree of zeal they had formerly shown for virtue, they now\r\nshowed by their actions a double degree of wickedness, whereby they made\r\nGod to be their enemy. For many angels11 of God accompanied with women,\r\nand begat sons that proved unjust, and despisers of all that was good,\r\non account of the confidence they had in their own strength; for the\r\ntradition is, that these men did what resembled the acts of those whom\r\nthe Grecians call giants. But Noah was very uneasy at what they did; and\r\nbeing displeased at their conduct, persuaded them to change their\r\ndispositions and their acts for the better: but seeing they did not\r\nyield to him, but were slaves to their wicked pleasures, he was afraid\r\nthey would kill him, together with his wife and children, and those they\r\nhad married; so he departed out of that land.\r\n\r\n2. Now God loved this man for his righteousness: yet he not only\r\ncondemned those other men for their wickedness, but determined to\r\ndestroy the whole race of mankind, and to make another race that should\r\nbe pure from wickedness; and cutting short their lives, and making their\r\nyears not so many as they formerly lived, but one hundred and twenty\r\nonly,12 he turned the dry land into sea; and thus were all these men\r\ndestroyed: but Noah alone was saved; for God suggested to him the\r\nfollowing contrivance and way of escape:—That he should make an ark of\r\nfour stories high, three hundred cubits13 long, fifty cubits broad, and\r\nthirty cubits high. Accordingly he entered into that ark, and his wife,\r\nand sons, and their wives, and put into it not only other provisions, to\r\nsupport their wants there, but also sent in with the rest all sorts of\r\nliving creatures, the male and his female, for the preservation of their\r\nkinds; and others of them by sevens. Now this ark had firm walls, and a\r\nroof, and was braced with cross beams, so that it could not be any way\r\ndrowned or overborne by the violence of the water. And thus was Noah,\r\nwith his family, preserved. Now he was the tenth from Adam, as being the\r\nson of Lamech, whose father was Mathusela; he was the son of Enoch, the\r\nson of Jared; and Jared was the son of Malaleel, who, with many of his\r\nsisters, were the children of Cainan, the son of Enos. Now Enos was the\r\nson of Seth, the son of Adam.\r\n\r\n3. This calamity happened in the six hundredth year of Noah's\r\ngovernment, [age,] in the second month, 14 called by the Macedonians\r\nDius, but by the Hebrews Marchesuan: for so did they order their year in\r\nEgypt. But Moses appointed that ú Nisan, which is the same with\r\nXanthicus, should be the first month for their festivals, because he\r\nbrought them out of Egypt in that month: so that this month began the\r\nyear as to all the solemnities they observed to the honor of God,\r\nalthough he preserved the original order of the months as to selling and\r\nbuying, and other ordinary affairs. Now he says that this flood began on\r\nthe twenty-seventh [seventeenth] day of the forementioned month; and\r\nthis was two thousand six hundred and fifty-six [one thousand six\r\nhundred and fifty-six] years from Adam, the first man; and the time is\r\nwritten down in our sacred books, those who then lived having noted\r\ndown,[15] with great accuracy, both the births and deaths of illustrious\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n4. For indeed Seth was born when Adam was in his two hundred and\r\nthirtieth year, who lived nine hundred and thirty years. Seth begat Enos\r\nin his two hundred and fifth year; who, when he had lived nine hundred\r\nand twelve years, delivered the government to Cainan his son, whom he\r\nhad in his hundred and ninetieth year. He lived nine hundred and five\r\nyears. Cainan, when he had lived nine hundred and ten years, had his son\r\nMalaleel, who was born in his hundred and seventieth year. This\r\nMalaleel, having lived eight hundred and ninety-five years, died,\r\nleaving his son Jared, whom he begat when he was in his hundred and\r\nsixty-fifth year. He lived nine hundred and sixty-two years; and then\r\nhis son Enoch succeeded him, who was born when his father was one\r\nhundred and sixty-two years old. Now he, when he had lived three hundred\r\nand sixty-five years, departed and went to God; whence it is that they\r\nhave not written down his death. Now Mathusela, the son of Enoch, who\r\nwas born to him when he was one hundred and sixty-five years old, had\r\nLamech for his son when he was one hundred and eighty-seven years of\r\nage; to whom he delivered the government, when he had retained it nine\r\nhundred and sixty-nine years. Now Lamech, when he had governed seven\r\nhundred and seventy-seven years, appointed Noah, his son, to be ruler of\r\nthe people, who was born to Lamech when he was one hundred and eighty-\r\ntwo years old, and retained the government nine hundred and fifty years.\r\nThese years collected together make up the sum before set down. But let\r\nno one inquire into the deaths of these men; for they extended their\r\nlives along together with their children and grandchildren; but let him\r\nhave regard to their births only.15\r\n\r\n5. When God gave the signal, and it began to rain, the water poured down\r\nforty entire days, till it became fifteen cubits higher than the earth;\r\nwhich was the reason why there was no greater number preserved, since\r\nthey had no place to fly to. When the rain ceased, the water did but\r\njust begin to abate after one hundred and fifty days, [that is, on the\r\nseventeenth day of the seventh month,] it then ceasing to subside for a\r\nlittle while. After this, the ark rested on the top of a certain\r\nmountain in Armenia; which, when Noah understood, he opened it; and\r\nseeing a small piece of land about it, he continued quiet, and conceived\r\nsome cheerful hopes of deliverance. But a few days afterward, when the\r\nwater was decreased to a greater degree, he sent out a raven, as\r\ndesirous to learn whether any other part of the earth were left dry by\r\nthe water, and whether he might go out of the ark with safety; but the\r\nraven, finding all the land still overflowed, returned to Noah again.\r\nAnd after seven days he sent out a dove, to know the state of the\r\nground; which came back to him covered with mud, and bringing an olive\r\nbranch: hereby Noah learned that the earth was become clear of the\r\nflood. So after he had staid seven more days, he sent the living\r\ncreatures out of the ark; and both he and his family went out, when he\r\nalso sacrificed to God, and feasted with his companions. However, the\r\nArmenians call this place, [GREEK] 16 The Place of Descent; for the ark\r\nbeing saved in that place, its remains are shown there by the\r\ninhabitants to this day.\r\n\r\n6. Now all the writers of barbarian histories make mention of this\r\nflood, and of this ark; among whom is Berosus the Chaldean. For when he\r\nis describing the circumstances of the flood, he goes on thus: \"It is\r\nsaid there is still some part of this ship in Armenia, at the mountain\r\nof the Cordyaeans; and that some people carry off pieces of the bitumen,\r\nwhich they take away, and use chiefly as amulets for the averting of\r\nmischiefs.\" Hieronymus the Egyptian also, who wrote the Phoenician\r\nAntiquities, and Mnaseas, and a great many more, make mention of the\r\nsame. Nay, Nicolaus of Damascus, in his ninety-sixth book, hath a\r\nparticular relation about them; where he speaks thus: \"There is a great\r\nmountain in Armenia, over Minyas, called Baris, upon which it is\r\nreported that many who fled at the time of the Deluge were saved; and\r\nthat one who was carried in an ark came on shore upon the top of it; and\r\nthat the remains of the timber were a great while preserved. This might\r\nbe the man about whom Moses the legislator of the Jews wrote.\"\r\n\r\n7. But as for Noah, he was afraid, since God had determined to destroy\r\nmankind, lest he should drown the earth every year; so he offered burnt-\r\nofferings, and besought God that nature might hereafter go on in its\r\nformer orderly course, and that he would not bring on so great a\r\njudgment any more, by which the whole race of creatures might be in\r\ndanger of destruction: but that, having now punished the wicked, he\r\nwould of his goodness spare the remainder, and such as he had hitherto\r\njudged fit to be delivered from so severe a calamity; for that otherwise\r\nthese last must be more miserable than the first, and that they must be\r\ncondemned to a worse condition than the others, unless they be suffered\r\nto escape entirely; that is, if they be reserved for another deluge;\r\nwhile they must be afflicted with the terror and sight of the first\r\ndeluge, and must also be destroyed by a second. He also entreated God to\r\naccept of his sacrifice, and to grant that the earth might never again\r\nundergo the like effects of 'his wrath; that men might be permitted to\r\ngo on cheerfully in cultivating the same; to build cities, and live\r\nhappily in them; and that they might not be deprived of any of those\r\ngood things which they enjoyed before the Flood; but might attain to the\r\nlike length of days, and old age, which the ancient people had arrived\r\nat before.\r\n\r\n8. When Noah had made these supplications, God, who loved the man for\r\nhis righteousness, granted entire success to his prayers, and said, that\r\nit was not he who brought the destruction on a polluted world, but that\r\nthey underwent that vengeance on account of their own wickedness; and\r\nthat he had not brought men into the world if he had himself determined\r\nto destroy them, it being an instance of greater wisdom not to have\r\ngranted them life at all, than, after it was granted, to procure their\r\ndestruction; \"But the injuries,\" said he, \"they offered to my holiness\r\nand virtue, forced me to bring this punishment upon them. But I will\r\nleave off for the time to come to require such punishments, the effects\r\nof so great wrath, for their future wicked actions, and especially on\r\naccount of thy prayers. But if I shall at any time send tempests of\r\nrain, in an extraordinary manner, be not affrighted at the largeness of\r\nthe showers; for the water shall no more overspread the earth. However,\r\nI require you to abstain from shedding the blood of men, and to keep\r\nyourselves pure from murder; and to punish those that commit any such\r\nthing. I permit you to make use of all the other living creatures at\r\nyour pleasure, and as your appetites lead you; for I have made you lords\r\nof them all, both of those that walk on the land, and those that swim in\r\nthe waters, and of those that fly in the regions of the air on high,\r\nexcepting their blood, for therein is the life. But I will give you a\r\nsign that I have left off my anger by my bow.\" [whereby is meant the\r\nrainbow, for they determined that the rainbow was the bow of God]. And\r\nwhen God had said and promised thus, he went away.\r\n\r\n9. Now when Noah had lived three hundred and fifty years after the\r\nFlood, and that all that time happily, he died, having lived the number\r\nof nine hundred and fifty years. But let no one, upon comparing the\r\nlives of the ancients with our lives, and with the few years which we\r\nnow live, think that what we have said of them is false; or make the\r\nshortness of our lives at present an argument, that neither did they\r\nattain to so long a duration of life, for those ancients were beloved of\r\nGod, and [lately] made by God himself; and because their food was then\r\nfitter for the prolongation of life, might well live so great a number\r\nof years: and besides, God afforded them a longer time of life on\r\naccount of their virtue, and the good use they made of it in\r\nastronomical and geometrical discoveries, which would not have afforded\r\nthe time of foretelling [the periods of the stars] unless they had lived\r\nsix hundred years; for the great year is completed in that interval. Now\r\nI have for witnesses to what I have said, all those that have written\r\nAntiquities, both among the Greeks and barbarians; for even Manetho, who\r\nwrote the Egyptian History, and Berosus, who collected the Chaldean\r\nMonuments, and Mochus, and Hestieus, and, besides these, Hieronymus the\r\nEgyptian, and those who composed the Phoenician History, agree to what I\r\nhere say: Hesiod also, and Hecatseus, Hellanicus, and Acusilaus; and,\r\nbesides these, Ephorus and Nicolaus relate that the ancients lived a\r\nthousand years. But as to these matters, let every one look upon them as\r\nhe thinks fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. Concerning The Tower Of Babylon, And The Confusion Of\r\nTongues.\r\n\r\n1. Now the sons of Noah were three,—Shem, Japhet, and Ham, born one\r\nhundred years before the Deluge. These first of all descended from the\r\nmountains into the plains, and fixed their habitation there; and\r\npersuaded others who were greatly afraid of the lower grounds on account\r\nof the flood, and so were very loath to come down from the higher\r\nplaces, to venture to follow their examples. Now the plain in which they\r\nfirst dwelt was called Shinar. God also commanded them to send colonies\r\nabroad, for the thorough peopling of the earth, that they might not\r\nraise seditions among themselves, but might cultivate a great part of\r\nthe earth, and enjoy its fruits after a plentiful manner. But they were\r\nso ill instructed that they did not obey God; for which reason they fell\r\ninto calamities, and were made sensible, by experience, of what sin they\r\nhad been guilty: for when they flourished with a numerous youth, God\r\nadmonished them again to send out colonies; but they, imagining the\r\nprosperity they enjoyed was not derived from the favor of God, but\r\nsupposing that their own power was the proper cause of the plentiful\r\ncondition they were in, did not obey him. Nay, they added to this their\r\ndisobedience to the Divine will, the suspicion that they were therefore\r\nordered to send out separate colonies, that, being divided asunder, they\r\nmight the more easily be Oppressed.\r\n\r\n2. Now it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of\r\nGod. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of\r\ngreat strength of hand. He persuaded them not to ascribe it to God, as\r\nif it was through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was\r\ntheir own courage which procured that happiness. He also gradually\r\nchanged the government into tyranny, seeing no other way of turning men\r\nfrom the fear of God, but to bring them into a constant dependence on\r\nhis power. He also said he would be revenged on God, if he should have a\r\nmind to drown the world again; for that he would build a tower too high\r\nfor the waters to be able to reach! and that he would avenge himself on\r\nGod for destroying their forefathers!\r\n\r\n3. Now the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of\r\nNimrod, and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they\r\nbuilt a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree\r\nnegligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands\r\nemployed in it, it grew very high, sooner than any one could expect; but\r\nthe thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that\r\nthereby its great height seemed, upon the view, to be less than it\r\nreally was. It was built of burnt brick, cemented together with mortar,\r\nmade of bitumen, that it might not be liable to admit water. When God\r\nsaw that they acted so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them\r\nutterly, since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the\r\nformer sinners; but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them\r\ndivers languages, and causing that, through the multitude of those\r\nlanguages, they should not be able to understand one another. The place\r\nwherein they built the tower is now called Babylon, because of the\r\nconfusion of that language which they readily understood before; for the\r\nHebrews mean by the word Babel, confusion. The Sibyl also makes mention\r\nof this tower, and of the confusion of the language, when she says thus:\r\n\"When all men were of one language, some of them built a high tower, as\r\nif they would thereby ascend up to heaven, but the gods sent storms of\r\nwind and overthrew the tower, and gave every one his peculiar language;\r\nand for this reason it was that the city was called Babylon.\" But as to\r\nthe plan of Shinar, in the country of Babylonia, Hestiaeus mentions it,\r\nwhen he says thus: \"Such of the priests as were saved, took the sacred\r\nvessels of Jupiter Enyalius, and came to Shinar of Babylonia.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. After What Manner The Posterity Of Noah Sent Out Colonies,\r\nAnd Inhabited The Whole Earth.\r\n\r\n1. After this they were dispersed abroad, on account of their languages,\r\nand went out by colonies every where; and each colony took possession of\r\nthat land which they light upon, and unto which God led them; so that\r\nthe whole continent was filled with them, both the inland and the\r\nmaritime countries. There were some also who passed over the sea in\r\nships, and inhabited the islands: and some of those nations do still\r\nretain the denominations which were given them by their first founders;\r\nbut some have lost them also, and some have only admitted certain\r\nchanges in them, that they might be the more intelligible to the\r\ninhabitants. And they were the Greeks who became the authors of such\r\nmutations. For when in after-ages they grew potent, they claimed to\r\nthemselves the glory of antiquity; giving names to the nations that\r\nsounded well [in Greek] that they might be better understood among\r\nthemselves; and setting agreeable forms of government over them, as if\r\nthey were a people derived from themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How Every Nation Was Denominated From Their First\r\nInhabitants.\r\n\r\n1. Now they were the grandchildren of Noah, in honor of whom names were\r\nimposed on the nations by those that first seized upon them. Japhet, the\r\nson of Noah, had seven sons: they inhabited so, that, beginning at the\r\nmountains Taurus and Amanus, they proceeded along Asia, as far as the\r\nriver Tansis, and along Europe to Cadiz; and settling themselves on the\r\nlands which they light upon, which none had inhabited before, they\r\ncalled the nations by their own names. For Gomer founded those whom the\r\nGreeks now call Galatians, [Galls,] but were then called Gomerites.\r\nMagog founded those that from him were named Magogites, but who are by\r\nthe Greeks called Scythians. Now as to Javan and Madai, the sons of\r\nJaphet; from Madai came the Madeans, who are called Medes, by the\r\nGreeks; but from Javan, Ionia, and all the Grecians, are derived. Thobel\r\nfounded the Thobelites, who are now called Iberes; and the Mosocheni\r\nwere founded by Mosoch; now they are Cappadocians. There is also a mark\r\nof their ancient denomination still to be shown; for there is even now\r\namong them a city called Mazaca, which may inform those that are able to\r\nunderstand, that so was the entire nation once called. Thiras also\r\ncalled those whom he ruled over Thirasians; but the Greeks changed the\r\nname into Thracians. And so many were the countries that had the\r\nchildren of Japhet for their inhabitants. Of the three sons of Gomer,\r\nAschanax founded the Aschanaxians, who are now called by the Greeks\r\nRheginians. So did Riphath found the Ripheans, now called Paphlagonians;\r\nand Thrugramma the Thrugrammeans, who, as the Greeks resolved, were\r\nnamed Phrygians. Of the three sons of Javan also, the son of Japhet,\r\nElisa gave name to the Eliseans, who were his subjects; they are now the\r\nAeolians. Tharsus to the Tharsians, for so was Cilicia of old called;\r\nthe sign of which is this, that the noblest city they have, and a\r\nmetropolis also, is Tarsus, the tau being by change put for the theta.\r\nCethimus possessed the island Cethima: it is now called Cyprus; and from\r\nthat it is that all islands, and the greatest part of the sea-coasts,\r\nare named Cethim by the Hebrews: and one city there is in Cyprus that\r\nhas been able to preserve its denomination; it has been called Citius by\r\nthose who use the language of the Greeks, and has not, by the use of\r\nthat dialect, escaped the name of Cethim. And so many nations have the\r\nchildren and grandchildren of Japhet possessed. Now when I have premised\r\nsomewhat, which perhaps the Greeks do not know, I will return and\r\nexplain what I have omitted; for such names are pronounced here after\r\nthe manner of the Greeks, to please my readers; for our own country\r\nlanguage does not so pronounce them: but the names in all cases are of\r\none and the same ending; for the name we here pronounce Noeas, is there\r\nNoah, and in every case retains the same termination.\r\n\r\n2. The children of Ham possessed the land from Syria and Amanus, and the\r\nmountains of Libanus; seizing upon all that was on its sea-coasts, and\r\nas far as the ocean, and keeping it as their own. Some indeed of its\r\nnames are utterly vanished away; others of them being changed, and\r\nanother sound given them, are hardly to be discovered; yet a few there\r\nare which have kept their denominations entire. For of the four sons of\r\nHam, time has not at all hurt the name of Chus; for the Ethiopians, over\r\nwhom he reigned, are even at this day, both by themselves and by all men\r\nin Asia, called Chusites. The memory also of the Mesraites is preserved\r\nin their name; for all we who inhabit this country [of Judea] called\r\nEgypt Mestre, and the Egyptians Mestreans. Phut also was the founder of\r\nLibya, and called the inhabitants Phutites, from himself: there is also\r\na river in the country of Moors which bears that name; whence it is that\r\nwe may see the greatest part of the Grecian historiographers mention\r\nthat river and the adjoining country by the appellation of Phut: but the\r\nname it has now has been by change given it from one of the sons of\r\nMesraim, who was called Lybyos. We will inform you presently what has\r\nbeen the occasion why it has been called Africa also. Canaan, the fourth\r\nson of Ham, inhabited the country now called Judea, and called it from\r\nhis own name Canaan. The children of these [four] were these: Sabas, who\r\nfounded the Sabeans; Evilas, who founded the Evileans, who are called\r\nGetuli; Sabathes founded the Sabathens, they are now called by the\r\nGreeks Astaborans; Sabactas settled the Sabactens; and Ragmus the\r\nRagmeans; and he had two sons, the one of whom, Judadas, settled the\r\nJudadeans, a nation of the western Ethiopians, and left them his name;\r\nas did Sabas to the Sabeans: but Nimrod, the son of Chus, staid and\r\ntyrannized at Babylon, as we have already informed you. Now all the\r\nchildren of Mesraim, being eight in number, possessed the country from\r\nGaza to Egypt, though it retained the name of one only, the Philistim;\r\nfor the Greeks call part of that country Palestine. As for the rest,\r\nLudieim, and Enemim, and Labim, who alone inhabited in Libya, and called\r\nthe country from himself, Nedim, and Phethrosim, and Chesloim, and\r\nCephthorim, we know nothing of them besides their names; for the\r\nEthiopic war17 which we shall describe hereafter, was the cause that\r\nthose cities were overthrown. The sons of Canaan were these: Sidonius,\r\nwho also built a city of the same name; it is called by the Greeks Sidon\r\nAmathus inhabited in Amathine, which is even now called Amathe by the\r\ninhabitants, although the Macedonians named it Epiphania, from one of\r\nhis posterity: Arudeus possessed the island Aradus: Arucas possessed\r\nArce, which is in Libanus. But for the seven others, [Eueus,] Chetteus,\r\nJebuseus, Amorreus, Gergesus, Eudeus, Sineus, Samareus, we have nothing\r\nin the sacred books but their names, for the Hebrews overthrew their\r\ncities; and their calamities came upon them on the occasion following.\r\n\r\n3. Noah, when, after the deluge, the earth was resettled in its former\r\ncondition, set about its cultivation; and when he had planted it with\r\nvines, and when the fruit was ripe, and he had gathered the grapes in\r\ntheir season, and the wine was ready for use, he offered sacrifice, and\r\nfeasted, and, being drunk, he fell asleep, and lay naked in an unseemly\r\nmanner. When his youngest son saw this, he came laughing, and showed him\r\nto his brethren; but they covered their father's nakedness. And when\r\nNoah was made sensible of what had been done, he prayed for prosperity\r\nto his other sons; but for Ham, he did not curse him, by reason of his\r\nnearness in blood, but cursed his prosperity: and when the rest of them\r\nescaped that curse, God inflicted it on the children of Canaan. But as\r\nto these matters, we shall speak more hereafter.\r\n\r\n4. Shem, the third son of Noah, had five sons, who inhabited the land\r\nthat began at Euphrates, and reached to the Indian Ocean. For Elam left\r\nbehind him the Elamites, the ancestors of the Persians. Ashur lived at\r\nthe city Nineve; and named his subjects Assyrians, who became the most\r\nfortunate nation, beyond others. Arphaxad named the Arphaxadites, who\r\nare now called Chaldeans. Aram had the Aramites, which the Greeks called\r\nSyrians; as Laud founded the Laudites, which are now called Lydians. Of\r\nthe four sons of Aram, Uz founded Trachonitis and Damascus: this country\r\nlies between Palestine and Celesyria. Ul founded Armenia; and Gather the\r\nBactrians; and Mesa the Mesaneans; it is now called Charax Spasini. Sala\r\nwas the son of Arphaxad; and his son was Heber, from whom they\r\noriginally called the Jews Hebrews. 18 Heber begat Joetan and Phaleg: he\r\nwas called Phaleg, because he was born at the dispersion of the nations\r\nto their several countries; for Phaleg among the Hebrews signifies\r\ndivision. Now Joctan, one of the sons of Heber, had these sons, Elmodad,\r\nSaleph, Asermoth, Jera, Adoram, Aizel, Decla, Ebal, Abimael, Sabeus,\r\nOphir, Euilat, and Jobab. These inhabited from Cophen, an Indian river,\r\nand in part of Asia adjoining to it. And this shall suffice concerning\r\nthe sons of Shem.\r\n\r\n5. I will now treat of the Hebrews. The son of Phaleg, whose father Was\r\nHeber, was Ragau; whose son was Serug, to whom was born Nahor; his son\r\nwas Terah, who was the father of Abraham, who accordingly was the tenth\r\nfrom Noah, and was born in the two hundred and ninety-second year after\r\nthe deluge; for Terah begat Abram in his seventieth year. Nahor begat\r\nHaran when he was one hundred and twenty years old; Nahor was born to\r\nSerug in his hundred and thirty-second year; Ragau had Serug at one\r\nhundred and thirty; at the same age also Phaleg had Ragau; Heber begat\r\nPhaleg in his hundred and thirty-fourth year; he himself being begotten\r\nby Sala when he was a hundred and thirty years old, whom Arphaxad had\r\nfor his son at the hundred and thirty-fifth year of his age. Arphaxad\r\nwas the son of Shem, and born twelve years after the deluge. Now Abram\r\nhad two brethren, Nahor and Haran: of these Haran left a son, Lot; as\r\nalso Sarai and Milcha his daughters; and died among the Chaldeans, in a\r\ncity of the Chaldeans, called Ur; and his monument is shown to this day.\r\nThese married their nieces. Nabor married Milcha, and Abram married\r\nSarai. Now Terah hating Chaldea, on account of his mourning for Ilaran,\r\nthey all removed to Haran of Mesopotamia, where Terah died, and was\r\nburied, when he had lived to be two hundred and five years old; for the\r\nlife of man was already, by degrees, diminished, and became shorter than\r\nbefore, till the birth of Moses; after whom the term of human life was\r\none hundred and twenty years, God determining it to the length that\r\nMoses happened to live. Now Nahor had eight sons by Milcha; Uz and Buz,\r\nKemuel, Chesed, Azau, Pheldas, Jadelph, and Bethuel. These were all the\r\ngenuine sons of Nahor; for Teba, and Gaam, and Tachas, and Maaca, were\r\nborn of Reuma his concubine: but Bethuel had a daughter, Rebecca, and a\r\nson, Laban.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How Abram Our Forefather Went Out Of The Land Of The\r\nChaldeans, And Lived In The Land Then Called Canaan But Now Judea.\r\n\r\n1. Now Abram, having no son of his own, adopted Lot, his brother Haran's\r\nson, and his wife Sarai's brother; and he left the land of Chaldea when\r\nhe was seventy-five years old, and at the command of God went into\r\nCanaan, and therein he dwelt himself, and left it to his posterity. He\r\nwas a person of great sagacity, both for understanding all things and\r\npersuading his hearers, and not mistaken in his opinions; for which\r\nreason he began to have higher notions of virtue than others had, and he\r\ndetermined to renew and to change the opinion all men happened then to\r\nhave concerning God; for he was the first that ventured to publish this\r\nnotion, That there was but one God, the Creator of the universe; and\r\nthat, as to other [gods], if they contributed any thing to the happiness\r\nof men, that each of them afforded it only according to his appointment,\r\nand not by their own power. This his opinion was derived from the\r\nirregular phenomena that were visible both at land and sea, as well as\r\nthose that happen to the sun, and moon, and all the heavenly bodies,\r\nthus:—\"If [said he] these bodies had power of their own, they would\r\ncertainly take care of their own regular motions; but since they do not\r\npreserve such regularity, they make it plain, that in so far as they co-\r\noperate to our advantage, they do it not of their own abilities, but as\r\nthey are subservient to Him that commands them, to whom alone we ought\r\njustly to offer our honor and thanksgiving.\" For which doctrines, when\r\nthe Chaldeans, and other people of Mesopotamia, raised a tumult against\r\nhim, he thought fit to leave that country; and at the command and by the\r\nassistance of God, he came and lived in the land of Canaan. And when he\r\nwas there settled, he built an altar, and performed a sacrifice to God.\r\n\r\n2. Berosus mentions our father Abram without naming him, when he says\r\nthus: \"In the tenth generation after the Flood, there was among the\r\nChaldeans a man righteous and great, and skillful in the celestial\r\nscience.\" But Hecatseus does more than barely mention him; for he\r\ncomposed, and left behind him, a book concerning him. And Nicolaus of\r\nDamascus, in the fourth book of his History, says thus: \"Abram reigned\r\nat Damascus, being a foreigner, who came with an army out of the land\r\nabove Babylon, called the land of the Chaldeans: but, after a long time,\r\nhe got him up, and removed from that country also, with his people, and\r\nwent into the land then called the land of Canaan, but now the land of\r\nJudea, and this when his posterity were become a multitude; as to which\r\nposterity of his, we relate their history in another work. Now the name\r\nof Abram is even still famous in the country of Damascus; and there is\r\nshown a village named from him, The Habitation of Abram.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. That When There Was A Famine In Canaan, Abram Went Thence\r\nInto Egypt; And After He Had Continued There A While He Returned Back\r\nAgain.\r\n\r\n1. Now, after this, when a famine had invaded the land of Canaan, and\r\nAbram had discovered that the Egyptians were in a flourishing condition,\r\nhe was disposed to go down to them, both to partake of the plenty they\r\nenjoyed, and to become an auditor of their priests, and to know what\r\nthey said concerning the gods; designing either to follow them, if they\r\nhad better notions than he, or to convert them into a better way, if his\r\nown notions proved the truest. Now, seeing he was to take Sarai with\r\nhim, and was afraid of the madness of the Egyptians with regard to\r\nwomen, lest the king should kill him on occasion of his wife's great\r\nbeauty, he contrived this device:—he pretended to be her brother, and\r\ndirected her in a dissembling way to pretend the same, for he said it\r\nwould be for their benefit. Now, as soon as he came into Egypt, it\r\nhappened to Abram as he supposed it would; for the fame of his wife's\r\nbeauty was greatly talked of; for which reason Pharaoh, the king of\r\nEgypt, would not be satisfied with what was reported of her, but would\r\nneeds see her himself, and was preparing to enjoy her; but God put a\r\nstop to his unjust inclinations, by sending upon him a distemper, and a\r\nsedition against his government. And when he inquired of the priests how\r\nhe might be freed from these calamities, they told him that this his\r\nmiserable condition was derived from the wrath of God, upon account of\r\nhis inclinations to abuse the stranger's wife. He then, out of fear,\r\nasked Sarai who she was, and who it was that she brought along with her.\r\nAnd when he had found out the truth, he excused himself to Abram, that\r\nsupposing the woman to be his sister, and not his wife, he set his\r\naffections on her, as desiring an affinity with him by marrying her, but\r\nnot as incited by lust to abuse her. He also made him a large present in\r\nmoney, and gave him leave to enter into conversation with the most\r\nlearned among the Egyptians; from which conversation his virtue and his\r\nreputation became more conspicuous than they had been before.\r\n\r\n2. For whereas the Egyptians were formerly addicted to different\r\ncustoms, and despised one another's sacred and accustomed rites, and\r\nwere very angry one with another on that account, Abram conferred with\r\neach of them, and, confuting the reasonings they made use of, every one\r\nfor their own practices, demonstrated that such reasonings were vain and\r\nvoid of truth: whereupon he was admired by them in those conferences as\r\na very wise man, and one of great sagacity, when he discoursed on any\r\nsubject he undertook; and this not only in understanding it, but in\r\npersuading other men also to assent to him. He communicated to them\r\narithmetic, and delivered to them the science of astronomy; for before\r\nAbram came into Egypt they were unacquainted with those parts of\r\nlearning; for that science came from the Chaldeans into Egypt, and from\r\nthence to the Greeks also.\r\n\r\n3. As soon as Abram was come back into Canaan, he parted the land\r\nbetween him and Lot, upon account of the tumultuous behavior of their\r\nshepherds, concerning the pastures wherein they should feed their\r\nflocks. However, he gave Lot his option, or leave, to choose which lands\r\nhe would take; and he took himself what the other left, which were the\r\nlower grounds at the foot of the mountains; and he himself dwelt in\r\nHebron, which is a city seven years more ancient than Tunis of Egypt.\r\nBut Lot possessed the land of the plain, and the river Jordan, not far\r\nfrom the city of Sodom, which was then a fine city, but is now\r\ndestroyed, by the will and wrath of God, the cause of which I shall show\r\nin its proper place hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. The Destruction Of The Sodomites By The Assyrian War.\r\n\r\nAt this time, when the Assyrians had the dominion over Asia, the people\r\nof Sodom were in a flourishing condition, both as to riches and the\r\nnumber of their youth. There were five kings that managed the affairs of\r\nthis county: Ballas, Barsas, Senabar, and Sumobor, with the king of\r\nBela; and each king led on his own troops: and the Assyrians made war\r\nupon them; and, dividing their army into four parts, fought against\r\nthem. Now every part of the army had its own commander; and when the\r\nbattle was joined, the Assyrians were conquerors, and imposed a tribute\r\non the kings of the Sodomites, who submitted to this slavery twelve\r\nyears; and so long they continued to pay their tribute: but on the\r\nthirteenth year they rebelled, and then the army of the Assyrians came\r\nupon them, under their commanders Amraphel, Arioch, Chodorlaomer, and\r\nTidal. These kings had laid waste all Syria, and overthrown the\r\noffspring of the giants. And when they were come over against Sodom,\r\nthey pitched their camp at the vale called the Slime Pits, for at that\r\ntime there were pits in that place; but now, upon the destruction of the\r\ncity of Sodom, that vale became the Lake Asphaltites, as it is called.\r\nHowever, concerning this lake we shall speak more presently. Now when\r\nthe Sodomites joined battle with the Assyrians, and the fight was very\r\nobstinate, many of them were killed, and the rest were carried captive;\r\namong which captives was Lot, who had come to assist the Sodomites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. How Abram Fought With The Assyrians, And Overcame Them, And\r\nSaved The Sodomite Prisoners, And Took From The Assyrians The Prey They\r\nHad Gotten.\r\n\r\n1. When, Abram heard of their calamity, he was at once afraid for Lot\r\nhis kinsman, and pitied the Sodomites, his friends and neighbors; and\r\nthinking it proper to afford them assistance, he did not delay it, but\r\nmarched hastily, and the fifth night fell upon the Assyrians, near Dan,\r\nfor that is the name of the other spring of Jordan; and before they\r\ncould arm themselves, he slew some as they were in their beds, before\r\nthey could suspect any harm; and others, who were not yet gone to sleep,\r\nbut were so drunk they could not fight, ran away. Abram pursued after\r\nthem, till, on the second day, he drove them in a body unto Hoba, a\r\nplace belonging to Damascus; and thereby demonstrated that victory does\r\nnot depend on multitude and the number of hands, but the alacrity and\r\ncourage of soldiers overcome the most numerous bodies of men, while he\r\ngot the victory over so great an army with no more than three hundred\r\nand eighteen of his servants, and three of his friends: but all those\r\nthat fled returned home ingloriously.\r\n\r\n2. So Abram, when he had saved the captive Sodomites, who had been taken\r\nby the Assyrians, and Lot also, his kinsman, returned home in peace. Now\r\nthe king of Sodom met him at a certain place, which they called The\r\nKing's Dale, where Melchisedec, king of the city Salem, received him.\r\nThat name signifies, the righteous king: and such he was, without\r\ndispute, insomuch that, on this account, he was made the priest of God:\r\nhowever, they afterward called Salem Jerusalem. Now this Melchisedec\r\nsupplied Abram's army in an hospitable manner, and gave them provisions\r\nin abundance; and as they were feasting, he began to praise him, and to\r\nbless God for subduing his enemies under him. And when Abram gave him\r\nthe tenth part of his prey, he accepted of the gift: but the king of\r\nSodom desired Abram to take the prey, but entreated that he might have\r\nthose men restored to him whom Abram had saved from the Assyrians,\r\nbecause they belonged to him. But Abram would not do so; nor would make\r\nany other advantage of that prey than what his servants had eaten; but\r\nstill insisted that he should afford a part to his friends that had\r\nassisted him in the battle. The first of them was called Eschol, and\r\nthen Enner, and Mambre.\r\n\r\n3. And God commended his virtue, and said, Thou shalt not however lose\r\nthe rewards thou hast deserved to receive by such thy glorious actions.\r\nHe answered, And what advantage will it be to me to have such rewards,\r\nwhen I have none to enjoy them after me?—for he was hitherto childless.\r\nAnd God promised that he should have a son, and that his posterity\r\nshould be very numerous; insomuch that their number should be like the\r\nstars. When he heard that, he offered a sacrifice to God, as he\r\ncommanded him. The manner of the sacrifice was this:—He took an heifer\r\nof three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram in like\r\nmanner of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a pigeon 19 and as he\r\nwas enjoined, he divided the three former, but the birds he did not\r\ndivide. After which, before he built his altar, where the birds of prey\r\nflew about, as desirous of blood, a Divine voice came to him, declaring\r\nthat their neighbors would be grievous to his posterity, when they\r\nshould be in Egypt, for four hundred years; 20 during which time they\r\nshould be afflicted, but afterwards should overcome their enemies,\r\nshould conquer the Canaanites in war, and possess themselves of their\r\nland, and of their cities.\r\n\r\n4. Now Abram dwelt near the oak called Ogyges,—the place belongs to\r\nCanaan, not far from the city of Hebron. But being uneasy at his wife's\r\nbarrenness, he entreated God to grant that he might have male issue; and\r\nGod required of him to be of good courage, and said that he would add to\r\nall the rest of the benefits that he had bestowed upon him, ever since\r\nhe led him out of Mesopotamia, the gift of children. Accordingly Sarai,\r\nat God's command, brought to his bed one of her handmaidens, a woman of\r\nEgyptian descent, in order to obtain children by her; and when this\r\nhandmaid was with child, she triumphed, and ventured to affront Sarai,\r\nas if the dominion were to come to a son to be born of her. But when\r\nAbram resigned her into the hand of Sarai, to punish her, she contrived\r\nto fly away, as not able to bear the instances of Sarai's severity to\r\nher; and she entreated God to have compassion on her. Now a Divine Angel\r\nmet her, as she was going forward in the wilderness, and bid her return\r\nto her master and mistress, for if she would submit to that wise advice,\r\nshe would live better hereafter; for that the reason of her being in\r\nsuch a miserable case was this, that she had been ungrateful and\r\narrogant towards her mistress. He also told her, that if she disobeyed\r\nGod, and went on still in her way, she should perish; but if she would\r\nreturn back, she should become the mother of a son who should reign over\r\nthat country. These admonitions she obeyed, and returned to her master\r\nand mistress, and obtained forgiveness. A little while afterwards, she\r\nbare Ismael; which may be interpreted Heard of God, because God had\r\nheard his mother's prayer.\r\n\r\n5. The forementioned son was born to Abram when he was eighty-six years\r\nold: but when he was ninety-nine, God appeared to him, and promised him\r\nthat he Should have a son by Sarai, and commanded that his name should\r\nbe Isaac; and showed him, that from this son should spring great nations\r\nand kings, and that they should obtain all the land of Canaan by war,\r\nfrom Sidon to Egypt. But he charged him, in order to keep his posterity\r\nunmixed with others, that they should be circumcised in the flesh of\r\ntheir foreskin, and that this should be done on the eighth day after\r\nthey were born: the reason of which circumcision I will explain in\r\nanother place. And Abram inquiring also concerning Ismael, whether he\r\nshould live or not, God signified to him that he should live to be very\r\nold, and should be the father of great nations. Abram therefore gave\r\nthanks to God for these blessings; and then he, and all his family, and\r\nhis son Ismael, were circumcised immediately; the son being that day\r\nthirteen years of age, and he ninety-nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. How God Overthrew The Nation Of The Sodomites, Out Of His\r\nWrath Against Them For Their Sins.\r\n\r\n1. About this time the Sodomites grew proud, on account of their riches\r\nand great wealth; they became unjust towards men, and impious towards\r\nGod, insomuch that they did not call to mind the advantages they\r\nreceived from him: they hated strangers, and abused themselves with\r\nSodomitical practices. God was therefore much displeased at them, and\r\ndetermined to punish them for their pride, and to overthrow their city,\r\nand to lay waste their country, until there should neither plant nor\r\nfruit grow out of it.\r\n\r\n2. When God had thus resolved concerning the Sodomites, Abraham, as he\r\nsat by the oak of Mambre, at the door of his tent, saw three angels; and\r\nthinking them to be strangers, he rose up, and saluted them, and desired\r\nthey would accept of an entertainment, and abide with him; to which,\r\nwhen they agreed, he ordered cakes of meal to be made presently; and\r\nwhen he had slain a calf, he roasted it, and brought it to them, as they\r\nsat under the oak. Now they made a show of eating; and besides, they\r\nasked him about his wife Sarah, where she was; and when he said she was\r\nwithin, they said they would come again hereafter, and find her become a\r\nmother. Upon which the woman laughed, and said that it was impossible\r\nshe should bear children, since she was ninety years of age, and her\r\nhusband was a hundred. Then they concealed themselves no longer, but\r\ndeclared that they were angels of God; and that one of them was sent to\r\ninform them about the child, and two of the overthrow of Sodom.\r\n\r\n3. When Abraham heard this, he was grieved for the Sodomites; and he\r\nrose up, and besought God for them, and entreated him that he would not\r\ndestroy the righteous with the wicked. And when God had replied that\r\nthere was no good man among the Sodomites; for if there were but ten\r\nsuch man among them, he would not punish any of them for their sins,\r\nAbraham held his peace. And the angels came to the city of the\r\nSodomites, and Lot entreated them to accept of a lodging with him; for\r\nhe was a very generous and hospitable man, and one that had learned to\r\nimitate the goodness of Abraham. Now when the Sodomites saw the young\r\nmen to be of beautiful countenances, and this to an extraordinary\r\ndegree, and that they took up their lodgings with Lot, they resolved\r\nthemselves to enjoy these beautiful boys by force and violence; and when\r\nLot exhorted them to sobriety, and not to offer any thing immodest to\r\nthe strangers, but to have regard to their lodging in his house; and\r\npromised that if their inclinations could not be governed, he would\r\nexpose his daughters to their lust, instead of these strangers; neither\r\nthus were they made ashamed.\r\n\r\n4. But God was much displeased at their impudent behavior, so that he\r\nboth smote those men with blindness, and condemned the Sodomites to\r\nuniversal destruction. But Lot, upon God's informing him of the future\r\ndestruction of the Sodomites, went away, taking with him his wife and\r\ndaughters, who were two, and still virgins; for those that were\r\nbetrothed 21 to them were above the thoughts of going, and deemed that\r\nLot's words were trifling. God then cast a thunderbolt upon the city,\r\nand set it on fire, with its inhabitants; and laid waste the country\r\nwith the like burning, as I formerly said when I wrote the Jewish War.\r\n22 But Lot's wife continually turning back to view the city as she went\r\nfrom it, and being too nicely inquisitive what would become of it,\r\nalthough God had forbidden her so to do, was changed into a pillar of\r\nsalt;23 for I have seen it, and it remains at this day. Now he and his\r\ndaughters fled to a certain small place, encompassed with the fire, and\r\nsettled in it: it is to this day called Zoar, for that is the word which\r\nthe Hebrews use for a small thing. There it was that he lived a\r\nmiserable life, on account of his having no company, and his want of\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n5. But his daughters, thinking that all mankind were destroyed,\r\napproached to their father, 24 though taking care not to be perceived.\r\nThis they did, that human kind might not utterly fail: and they bare\r\nsons; the son of the elder was named Moab, Which denotes one derived\r\nfrom his father; the younger bare Ammon, which name denotes one derived\r\nfrom a kinsman. The former of whom was the father of the Moabites, which\r\nis even still a great nation; the latter was the father of the\r\nAmmonites; and both of them are inhabitants of Celesyria. And such was\r\nthe departure of Lot from among the Sodomites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. Concerning Abimelech; And Concerning Ismael The Son Of\r\nAbraham; And Concerning The Arabians, Who Were His Posterity.\r\n\r\n1. Abraham now removed to Gerar of Palestine, leading Sarah along with\r\nhim, under the notion of his sister, using the like dissimulation that\r\nhe had used before, and this out of fear: for he was afraid of\r\nAbimelech, the king of that country, who did also himself fall in love\r\nwith Sarah, and was disposed to corrupt her; but he was restrained from\r\nsatisfying his lust by a dangerous distemper which befell him from God.\r\nNow when his physicians despaired of curing him, he fell asleep, and saw\r\na dream, warning him not to abuse the stranger's wife; and when he\r\nrecovered, he told his friends that God had inflicted that disease upon\r\nhim, by way of punishment, for his injury to the stranger; and in order\r\nto preserve the chastity of his wife, for that she did not accompany him\r\nas his sister, but as his legitimate wife; and that God had promised to\r\nbe gracious to him for the time to come, if this person be once secure\r\nof his wife's chastity. When he had said this, by the advice of his\r\nfriends, he sent for Abraham, and bid him not to be concerned about his\r\nwife, or fear the corruption of her chastity; for that God took care of\r\nhim, and that it was by his providence that he received his wife again,\r\nwithout her suffering any abuse. And he appealed to God, and to his\r\nwife's conscience; and said that he had not any inclination at first to\r\nenjoy her, if he had known she was his wife; but since, said he, thou\r\nleddest her about as thy sister, I was guilty of no offense. He also\r\nentreated him to be at peace with him, and to make God propitious to\r\nhim; and that if he thought fit to continue with him, he should have\r\nwhat he wanted in abundance; but that if he designed to go away, he\r\nshould be honorably conducted, and have whatsoever supply he wanted when\r\nhe came thither. Upon his saying this, Abraham told him that his\r\npretense of kindred to his wife was no lie, because she was his\r\nbrother's daughter; and that he did not think himself safe in his\r\ntravels abroad, without this sort of dissimulation; and that he was not\r\nthe cause of his distemper, but was only solicitous for his own safety:\r\nhe said also, that he was ready to stay with him. Whereupon Abimelech\r\nassigned him land and money; and they coventanted to live together\r\nwithout guile, and took an oath at a certain well called Beersheba,\r\nwhich may be interpreted, The Well of the Oath: and so it is named by\r\nthe people of the country unto this day.\r\n\r\n2. Now in a little time Abraham had a son by Sarah, as God had foretold\r\nto him, whom he named Isaac, which signifies Laughter. And indeed they\r\nso called him, because Sarah laughed when God 25 said that she should\r\nbear a son, she not expecting such a thing, as being past the age of\r\nchild-bearing, for she was ninety years old, and Abraham a hundred; so\r\nthat this son was born to them both in the last year of each of those\r\ndecimal numbers. And they circumcised him upon the eighth day and from\r\nthat time the Jews continue the custom of circumcising their sons within\r\nthat number of days. But as for the Arabians, they circumcise after the\r\nthirteenth year, because Ismael, the founder of their nation, who was\r\nborn to Abraham of the concubine, was circumcised at that age;\r\nconcerning whom I will presently give a particular account, with great\r\nexactness.\r\n\r\n3. As for Sarah, she at first loved Ismael, who was born of her own\r\nhandmaid Hagar, with an affection not inferior to that of her own son,\r\nfor he was brought up in order to succeed in the government; but when\r\nshe herself had borne Isaac, she was not willing that Ismael should be\r\nbrought up with him, as being too old for him, and able to do him\r\ninjuries when their father should be dead; she therefore persuaded\r\nAbraham to send him and his mother to some distant country. Now, at the\r\nfirst, he did not agree to what Sarah was so zealous for, and thought it\r\nan instance of the greatest barbarity, to send away a young child 26 and\r\na woman unprovided of necessaries; but at length he agreed to it,\r\nbecause God was pleased with what Sarah had determined: so he delivered\r\nIsmael to his mother, as not yet able to go by himself; and commanded\r\nher to take a bottle of water, and a loaf of bread, and so to depart,\r\nand to take Necessity for her guide. But as soon as her necessary\r\nprovisions failed, she found herself in an evil case; and when the water\r\nwas almost spent, she laid the young child, who was ready to expire,\r\nunder a fig-tree, and went on further, that so he might die while she\r\nwas absent. But a Divine Angel came to her, and told her of a fountain\r\nhard by, and bid her take care, and bring up the child, because she\r\nshould be very happy by the preservation of Ismael. She then took\r\ncourage, upon the prospect of what was promised her, and, meeting with\r\nsome shepherds, by their care she got clear of the distresses she had\r\nbeen in.\r\n\r\n4. When the lad was grown up, he married a wife, by birth an Egyptian,\r\nfrom whence the mother was herself derived originally. Of this wife were\r\nborn to Ismael twelve sons; Nabaioth, Kedar, Abdeel, Mabsam, Idumas,\r\nMasmaos, Masaos, Chodad, Theman, Jetur, Naphesus, Cadmas. These\r\ninhabited all the country from Euphrates to the Red Sea, and called it\r\nNabatene. They are an Arabian nation, and name their tribes from these,\r\nboth because of their own virtue, and because of the dignity of Abraham\r\ntheir father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. Concerning Isaac The Legitimate Son Of Abraham.\r\n\r\n1. Now Abraham greatly loved Isaac, as being his only begotten 27 and\r\ngiven to him at the borders of old age, by the favor of God. The child\r\nalso endeared himself to his parents still more, by the exercise of\r\nevery virtue, and adhering to his duty to his parents, and being zealous\r\nin the worship of God. Abraham also placed his own happiness in this\r\nprospect, that, when he should die, he should leave this his son in a\r\nsafe and secure condition; which accordingly he obtained by the will of\r\nGod: who being desirous to make an experiment of Abraham's religious\r\ndisposition towards himself, appeared to him, and enumerated all the\r\nblessings he had bestowed on him; how he had made him superior to his\r\nenemies; and that his son Isaac, who was the principal part of his\r\npresent happiness, was derived from him; and he said that he required\r\nthis son of his as a sacrifice and holy oblation. Accordingly he\r\ncommanded him to carry him to the mountain Moriah, and to build an\r\naltar, and offer him for a burnt-offering upon it for that this would\r\nbest manifest his religious disposition towards him, if he preferred\r\nwhat was pleasing to God, before the preservation of his own son.\r\n\r\n2. Now Abraham thought that it was not right to disobey God in any\r\nthing, but that he was obliged to serve him in every circumstance of\r\nlife, since all creatures that live enjoy their life by his providence,\r\nand the kindness he bestows on them. Accordingly he concealed this\r\ncommand of God, and his own intentions about the slaughter of his son,\r\nfrom his wife, as also from every one of his servants, otherwise he\r\nshould have been hindered from his obedience to God; and he took Isaac,\r\ntogether with two of his servants, and laying what things were necessary\r\nfor a sacrifice upon an ass, he went away to the mountain. Now the two\r\nservants went along with him two days; but on the third day, as soon as\r\nhe saw the mountain, he left those servants that were with him till then\r\nin the plain, and, having his son alone with him, he came to the\r\nmountain. It was that mountain upon which king David afterwards built\r\nthe temple. 28 Now they had brought with them every thing necessary for\r\na sacrifice, excepting the animal that was to be offered only. Now Isaac\r\nwas twenty-five years old. And as he was building the altar, he asked\r\nhis father what he was about to offer, since there was no animal there\r\nfor an oblation:—to which it was answered, \"That God would provide\r\nhimself an oblation, he being able to make a plentiful provision for men\r\nout of what they have not, and to deprive others of what they already\r\nhave, when they put too much trust therein; that therefore, if God\r\npleased to be present and propitious at this sacrifice, he would provide\r\nhimself an oblation.\"\r\n\r\n3. As soon as the altar was prepared, and Abraham had laid on the wood,\r\nand all things were entirely ready, he said to his son, \"O son, I poured\r\nout a vast number of prayers that I might have thee for my son; when\r\nthou wast come into the world, there was nothing that could contribute\r\nto thy support for which I was not greatly solicitous, nor any thing\r\nwherein I thought myself happier than to see thee grown up to man's\r\nestate, and that I might leave thee at my death the successor to my\r\ndominion; but since it was by God's will that I became thy father, and\r\nit is now his will that I relinquish thee, bear this consecration to God\r\nwith a generous mind; for I resign thee up to God who has thought fit\r\nnow to require this testimony of honor to himself, on account of the\r\nfavors he hath conferred on me, in being to me a supporter and defender.\r\nAccordingly thou, my son, wilt now die, not in any common way of going\r\nout of the world, but sent to God, the Father of all men, beforehand, by\r\nthy own father, in the nature of a sacrifice. I suppose he thinks thee\r\nworthy to get clear of this world neither by disease, neither by war,\r\nnor by any other severe way, by which death usually comes upon men, but\r\nso that he will receive thy soul with prayers and holy offices of\r\nreligion, and will place thee near to himself, and thou wilt there be to\r\nme a succorer and supporter in my old age; on which account I\r\nprincipally brought thee up, and thou wilt thereby procure me God for my\r\nComforter instead of thyself.\"\r\n\r\n4. Now Isaac was of such a generous disposition as became the son of\r\nsuch a father, and was pleased with this discourse; and said, \"That he\r\nwas not worthy to be born at first, if he should reject the\r\ndetermination of God and of his father, and should not resign himself up\r\nreadily to both their pleasures; since it would have been unjust if he\r\nhad not obeyed, even if his father alone had so resolved.\" So he went\r\nimmediately to the altar to be sacrificed. And the deed had been done if\r\nGod had not opposed it; for he called loudly to Abraham by his name, and\r\nforbade him to slay his son; and said, \"It was not out of a desire of\r\nhuman blood that he was commanded to slay his son, nor was he willing\r\nthat he should be taken away from him whom he had made his father, but\r\nto try the temper of his mind, whether he would be obedient to such a\r\ncommand. Since therefore he now was satisfied as to that his alacrity,\r\nand the surprising readiness he showed in this his piety, he was\r\ndelighted in having bestowed such blessings upon him; and that he would\r\nnot be wanting in all sort of concern about him, and in bestowing other\r\nchildren upon him; and that his son should live to a very great age;\r\nthat he should live a happy life, and bequeath a large principality to\r\nhis children, who should be good and legitimate.\" He foretold also, that\r\nhis family should increase into many nations 29 and that those\r\npatriarchs should leave behind them an everlasting name; that they\r\nshould obtain the possession of the land of Canaan, and be envied by all\r\nmen. When God had said this, he produced to them a ram, which did not\r\nappear before, for the sacrifice. So Abraham and Isaac receiving each\r\nother unexpectedly, and having obtained the promises of such great\r\nblessings, embraced one another; and when they had sacrificed, they\r\nreturned to Sarah, and lived happily together, God affording them his\r\nassistance in all things they desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. Concerning Sarah Abraham's Wife; And How She Ended Her Days.\r\n\r\nNow Sarah died a little while after, having lived one hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven years. They buried her in Hebron; the Canaanites publicly\r\nallowing them a burying-place; which piece of ground Abraham bought for\r\nfour hundred shekels, of Ephron, an inhabitant of Hebron. And both\r\nAbraham and his descendants built themselves sepulchers in that place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15. How The Nation Of The Troglodytes Were Derived From Abraham\r\nBy Keturah.\r\n\r\nAbraham after this married Keturah, by whom six sons were born to him,\r\nmen of courage, and of sagacious minds: Zambran, and Jazar, and Madan,\r\nand Madian, and Josabak, and Sous. Now the sons of Sous were Sabathan\r\nand Dadan. The sons of Dadan were Latusim, and Assur, and Luom. The sons\r\nof Madiau were Ephas, and Ophren, and Anoch, and Ebidas, and Eldas. Now,\r\nfor all these sons and grandsons, Abraham contrived to settle them in\r\ncolonies; and they took possession of Troglodytis, and the country of\r\nArabia the Happy, as far as it reaches to the Red Sea. It is related of\r\nthis Ophren, that he made war against Libya, and took it, and that his\r\ngrandchildren, when they inhabited it, called it [from his name] Africa.\r\nAnd indeed Alexander Polyhistor gives his attestation to what I here\r\nsay; who speaks thus: \"Cleodemus the prophet, who was also called\r\nMalchus, who wrote a History of the Jews, in agreement with the History\r\nof Moses, their legislator, relates, that there were many sons born to\r\nAbraham by Keturah: nay, he names three of them, Apher, and Surim, and\r\nJaphran. That from Surim was the land of Assyria denominated; and that\r\nfrom the other two [Apher and Japbran] the country of Africa took its\r\nname, because these men were auxiliaries to Hercules, when he fought\r\nagainst Libya and Antaeus; and that Hercules married Aphra's daughter,\r\nand of her he begat a son, Diodorus; and that Sophon was his son, from\r\nwhom that barbarous people called Sophacians were denominated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16. How Isaac Took Rebeka To Wife.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Abraham, the father of Isaac, had resolved to take Rebeka,\r\nwho was grand-daughter to his brother Nahor, for a wife to his son\r\nIsaac, who was then about forty years old, he sent the ancientest of his\r\nservants to betroth her, after he had obliged him to give him the\r\nstrongest assurances of his fidelity; which assurances were given after\r\nthe manner following:—They put each other's hands under each other's\r\nthighs; then they called upon God as the witness of what was to be done.\r\nHe also sent such presents to those that were there as were in esteem,\r\non account that that they either rarely or never were seen in that\r\ncountry, The servant got thither not under a considerable time; for it\r\nrequires much time to pass through Meopotamia, in which it is tedious\r\ntraveling, both in the winter for the depth of the clay, and in summer\r\nfor want of water; and, besides this, for the robberies there committed,\r\nwhich are not to be avoided by travelers but by caution beforehand.\r\nHowever, the servant came to Haran; and when he was in the suburbs, he\r\nmet a considerable number of maidens going to the water; he therefore\r\nprayed to God that Rebeka might be found among them, or her whom Abraham\r\nsent him as his servant to espouse to his son, in case his will were\r\nthat this marriage should be consummated, and that she might be made\r\nknown to him by the sign, That while others denied him water to drink,\r\nshe might give it him.\r\n\r\n2. With this intention he went to the well, and desired the maidens to\r\ngive him some water to drink: but while the others refused, on pretense\r\nthat they wanted it all at home, and could spare none for him, one only\r\nof the company rebuked them for their peevish behavior towards the\r\nstranger; and said, What is there that you will ever communicate to\r\nanybody, who have not so much as given the man some water? She then\r\noffered him water in an obliging manner. And now he began to hope that\r\nhis grand affair would succeed; but desiring still to know the truth, he\r\ncommended her for her generosity and good nature, that she did not\r\nscruple to afford a sufficiency of water to those that wanted it, though\r\nit cost her some pains to draw it; and asked who were her parents, and\r\nwished them joy of such a daughter. \"And mayst thou be espoused,\" said\r\nhe, \"to their satisfaction, into the family of an agreeable husband, and\r\nbring him legitimate children.\" Nor did she disdain to satisfy his\r\ninquiries, but told him her family. \"They,\" says she, \"call me Rebeka;\r\nmy father was Bethuel, but he is dead; and Laban is my brother; and,\r\ntogether with my mother, takes care of all our family affairs, and is\r\nthe guardian of my virginity.\" When the servant heard this, he was very\r\nglad at what had happened, and at what was told him, as perceiving that\r\nGod had thus plainly directed his journey; and producing his bracelets,\r\nand some other ornaments which it was esteemed decent for virgins to\r\nwear, he gave them to the damsel, by way of acknowledgment, and as a\r\nreward for her kindness in giving him water to drink; saying, it was but\r\njust that she should have them, because she was so much more obliging\r\nthan any of the rest. She desired also that he would come and lodge with\r\nthem, since the approach of the night gave him not time to proceed\r\nfarther. And producing his precious ornaments for women, he said he\r\ndesired to trust them to none more safely than to such as she had shown\r\nherself to be; and that he believed he might guess at the humanity of\r\nher mother and brother, that they would not be displeased, from the\r\nvirtue he found in her; for he would not be burdensome, but would pay\r\nthe hire for his entertainment, and spend his own money. To which she\r\nreplied, that he guessed right as to the humanity of her parents; but\r\ncomplained that he should think them so parsimonious as to take money,\r\nfor that he should have all on free cost. But she said she would first\r\ninform her brother Laban, and, if he gave her leave, she would conduct\r\nhim in.\r\n\r\n3. As soon then as this was over, she introduced the stranger; and for\r\nthe camels, the servants of Laban brought them in, and took care of\r\nthem; and he was himself brought in to supper by Laban. And, after\r\nsupper, he says to him, and to the mother of the damsel, addressing\r\nhimself to her, \"Abraham is the son of Terah, and a kinsman of yours;\r\nfor Nahor, the grandfather of these children, was the brother of\r\nAbraham, by both father and mother; upon which account he hath sent me\r\nto you, being desirous to take this damsel for his son to wife. He is\r\nhis legitimate son, and is brought up as his only heir. He could indeed\r\nhave had the most happy of all the women in that country for him, but he\r\nwould not have his son marry any of them; but, out of regard to his own\r\nrelations, he desired him to match here, whose affection and inclination\r\nI would not have you despise; for it was by the good pleasure of God\r\nthat other accidents fell out in my journey, and that thereby I lighted\r\nupon your daughter and your house; for when I was near to the city, I\r\nsaw a great many maidens coming to a well, and I prayed that I might\r\nmeet with this damsel, which has come to pass accordingly. Do you\r\ntherefore confirm that marriage, whose espousals have been already made\r\nby a Divine appearance; and show the respect you have for Abraham, who\r\nhath sent me with so much solicitude, in giving your consent to the\r\nmarriage of this damsel.\" Upon this they understood it to be the will of\r\nGod, and greatly approved of the offer, and sent their daughter, as was\r\ndesired. Accordingly Isaac married her, the inheritance being now come\r\nto him; for the children by Keturah were gone to their own remote\r\nhabitations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17. Concerning The Death Of Abraham.\r\n\r\nA Little while after this Abraham died. He was a man of incomparable\r\nvirtue, and honored by God in a manner agreeable to his piety towards\r\nhim. The whole time of his life was one hundred seventy and five years,\r\nand he was buried in Hebron, with his wife Sarah, by their sons Isaac\r\nand Ismael.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18. Concerning The Sons Of Isaac, Esau And Jacob; Of Their\r\nNativity And Education.\r\n\r\n1. Now Isaac's wife proved with child, after the death of Abraham; 30\r\nand when her belly was greatly burdened, Isaac was very anxious, and\r\ninquired of God; who answered, that Rebeka should bear twins; and that\r\ntwo nations should take the names of those sons; and that he who\r\nappeared the second should excel the elder. Accordingly she, in a little\r\ntime, as God had foretold, bare twins; the elder of whom, from his head\r\nto his feet, was very rough and hairy; but the younger took hold of his\r\nheel as they were in the birth. Now the father loved the elder, who was\r\ncalled Esau, a name agreeable to his roughness, for the Hebrews call\r\nsuch a hairy roughness [Esau, 31 or] Seir; but Jacob the younger was\r\nbest beloved by his mother.\r\n\r\n2. When there was a famine in the land, Isaac resolved to go into Egypt,\r\nthe land there being good; but he went to Gerar, as God commanded him.\r\nHere Abimelech the king received him, because Abraham had formerly lived\r\nwith him, and had been his friend. And as in the beginning he treated\r\nhim exceeding kindly, so he was hindered from continuing in the same\r\ndisposition to the end, by his envy at him; for when he saw that God was\r\nwith Isaac, and took such great care of him, he drove him away from him.\r\nBut Isaac, when he saw how envy had changed the temper of Abimelech\r\nretired to a place called the Valley, not far from Gerar: and as he was\r\ndigging a well, the shepherds fell upon him, and began to fight, in\r\norder to hinder the work; and because he did not desire to contend, the\r\nshepherds seemed to get the him, so he still retired, and dug another\r\nand when certain other shepherds of Abimelech began to offer him\r\nviolence, he left that also, still retired, thus purchasing security to\r\nhimself a rational and prudent conduct. At length they gave him leave to\r\ndig a well without disturbance. He named this well Rehoboth, which\r\ndenotes a large space; but of the former wells, one was called Escon,\r\nwhich denotes strife, the other Sitenna, name signifies enmity.\r\n\r\n3. It was now that Isaac's affairs increased, and in a flourishing\r\ncondition; and this his great riches. But Abimelech, thinking in\r\nopposition to him, while their living made them suspicious of each\r\nother, and retiring showing a secret enmity also, he afraid that his\r\nformer friendship with Isaac would not secure him, if Isaac should\r\nendeavor the injuries he had formerly offered him; he therefore renewed\r\nhis friendship with him, Philoc, one of his generals. And when he had\r\nobtained every thing he desired, by reason of Isaac's good nature, who\r\npreferred the earlier friendship Abimelech had shown to himself and his\r\nfather to his later wrath against him, he returned home.\r\n\r\n4. Now when Esau, one of the sons of Isaac, whom the father principally\r\nloved, was now come to the age of forty years, he married Adah, the\r\ndaughter of Helon, and Aholibamah, the daughter of Esebeon; which Helon\r\nand Esebeon were great lords among the Canaanites: thereby taking upon\r\nhimself the authority, and pretending to have dominion over his own\r\nmarriages, without so much as asking the advice of his father; for had\r\nIsaac been the arbitrator, he had not given him leave to marry thus, for\r\nhe was not pleased with contracting any alliance with the people of that\r\ncountry; but not caring to be uneasy to his son by commanding him to put\r\naway these wives, he resolved to be silent.\r\n\r\n5. But when he was old, and could not see at all, he called Esau to him,\r\nand told him, that besides his blindness, and the disorder of his eyes,\r\nhis very old age hindered him from his worship of God [by sacrifice]; he\r\nbid him therefore to go out a hunting, and when he had caught as much\r\nvenison as he could, to prepare him a supper 32 that after this he might\r\nmake supplication to God, to be to him a supporter and an assister\r\nduring the whole time of his life; saying, that it was uncertain when he\r\nshould die, and that he was desirous, by prayers for him, to procure,\r\nbeforehand, God to be merciful to him.\r\n\r\n6. Accordingly, Esau went out a hunting. But Rebeka 33 thinking it\r\nproper to have the supplication made for obtaining the favor of God to\r\nJacob, and that without the consent of Isaac, bid him kill kids of the\r\ngoats, and prepare a supper. So Jacob obeyed his mother, according to\r\nall her instructions. Now when the supper was got ready, he took a\r\ngoat's skin, and put it about his arm, that by reason of its hairy\r\nroughness, he might by his father be believed to be Esau; for they being\r\ntwins, and in all things else alike, differed only in this thing. This\r\nwas done out of his fear, that before his father had made his\r\nsupplications, he should be caught in his evil practice, and lest he\r\nshould, on the contrary, provoke his father to curse him. So he brought\r\nin the supper to his father. Isaac perceivest to be Esau. So suspecting\r\nno deceit, he ate the supper, and betook himself to his prayers and\r\nintercessions with God; and said, \"O Lord of all ages, and Creator of\r\nall substance; for it was thou that didst propose to my father great\r\nplenty of good things, and hast vouchsafed to bestow on me what I have;\r\nand hast promised to my posterity to be their kind supporter, and to\r\nbestow on them still greater blessings; do thou therefore confirm these\r\nthy promises, and do not overlook me, because of my present weak\r\ncondition, on account of which I most earnestly pray to thee. Be\r\ngracious to this my son; and preserve him and keep him from every thing\r\nthat is evil. Give him a happy life, and the possession of as many good\r\nthings as thy power is able to bestow. Make him terrible to his enemies,\r\nand honorable and beloved among his friends.\"\r\n\r\n7. Thus did Isaac pray to God, thinking his prayers had been made for\r\nEsau. He had but just finished them, when Esau came in from hunting. And\r\nwhen Isaac perceived his mistake, he was silent: but Esau required that\r\nhe might be made partaker of the like blessing from his father that his\r\nbrother had partook of; but his father refused it, because all his\r\nprayers had been spent upon Jacob: so Esau lamented the mistake.\r\nHowever, his father being grieved at his weeping, said, that \"he should\r\nexcel in hunting and strength of body, in arms, and all such sorts of\r\nwork; and should obtain glory for ever on those accounts, he and his\r\nposterity after him; but still should serve his brother.\"\r\n\r\n8. Now the mother delivered Jacob, when she was afraid that his brother\r\nwould inflict some punishment upon him because of the mistake about the\r\nprayers of Isaac; for she persuaded her husband to take a wife for Jacob\r\nout of Mesopotamia, of her own kindred, Esau having married already\r\nBasemmath, the daughter of Ismael, without his father's consent; for\r\nIsaac did not like the Canaanites, so that he disapproved of Esau's\r\nformer marriages, which made him take Basemmath to wife, in order to\r\nplease him; and indeed he had a great affection for her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19. Concerning Jacob's Flight Into Mesopotamia, By Reason Of The\r\nFear He Was In Of His Brother.\r\n\r\n1. Now Jacob was sent by his mother to Mesopotamia, in order to marry\r\nLaban her brother's daughter [which marriage was permitted by Isaac, on\r\naccount of his obsequiousness to the desires of his wife]; and he\r\naccordingly journeyed through the land of Canaan; and because he hated\r\nthe people of that country, he would not lodge with any of them, but\r\ntook up his lodging in the open air, and laid his head on a heap of\r\nstones that he had gathered together. At which time he saw in his sleep\r\nsuch a vision standing by him:—he seemed to see a ladder that reached\r\nfrom the earth unto heaven, and persons descending upon the ladder that\r\nseemed more excellent than human; and at last God himself stood above\r\nit, and was plainly visible to him, who, calling him by his name, spake\r\nto him in these words:—\r\n\r\n2. \"O Jacob, it is not fit for thee, who art the son of a good father,\r\nand grandson of one who had obtained a great reputation for his eminent\r\nvirtue, to be dejected at thy present circumstances, but to hope for\r\nbetter times, for thou shalt have great abundance of all good things, by\r\nmy assistance: for I brought Abraham hither, out of Mesopotamia, when he\r\nwas driven away by his kinsmen, and I made thy father a happy man, nor\r\nwill I bestow a lesser degree of happiness on thyself: be of good\r\ncourage, therefore, and under my conduct proceed on this thy journey,\r\nfor the marriage thou goest so zealously about shall be consummated. And\r\nthou shalt have children of good characters, but their multitude shall\r\nbe innumerable; and they shall leave what they have to a still more\r\nnumerous posterity, to whom, and to whose posterity, I give the dominion\r\nof all the land, and their posterity shall fill the entire earth and\r\nsea, so far as the sun beholds them: but do not thou fear any danger,\r\nnor be afraid of the many labors thou must undergo, for by my providence\r\nI will direct thee what thou art to do in the time present, and still\r\nmuch more in the time to come.\"\r\n\r\n3. Such were the predictions which God made to Jacob; whereupon he\r\nbecame very joyful at what he had seen and heard; and he poured oil on\r\nthe stones, because on them the prediction of such great benefits was\r\nmade. He also vowed a vow, that he would offer sacrifices upon them, if\r\nhe lived and returned safe; and if he came again in such a condition, he\r\nwould give the tithe of what he had gotten to God. He also judged the\r\nplace to be honorable and gave it the name of Bethel, which, in the\r\nGreek, is interpreted, The House of God.\r\n\r\n4. So he proceeded on his journey to Mesopotamia, and at length came to\r\nHaran; and meeting with shepherds in the suburbs, with boys grown up,\r\nand maidens sitting about a certain well, he staid with them, as wanting\r\nwater to drink; and beginning to discourse with them, he asked them\r\nwhether they knew such a one as Laban, and whether he was still alive.\r\nNow they all said they knew him, for he was not so inconsiderable a\r\nperson as to be unknown to any of them; and that his daughter fed her\r\nfather's flock together with them; and that indeed they wondered that\r\nshe was not yet come, for by her means thou mightest learn more exactly\r\nwhatever thou desirest to know about that family. While they were saying\r\nthis the damsel came, and the other shepherds that came down along with\r\nher. Then they showed her Jacob, and told her that he was a stranger,\r\nwho came to inquire about her father's affairs. But she, as pleased,\r\nafter the custom of children, with Jacob's coming, asked him who he was,\r\nand whence he came to them, and what it was he lacked that he came\r\nthither. She also wished it might be in their power to supply the wants\r\nhe came about.\r\n\r\n5. But Jacob was quite overcome, not so much by their kindred, nor by\r\nthat affection which might arise thence, as by his love to the damsel,\r\nand his surprise at her beauty, which was so flourishing, as few of the\r\nwomen of that age could vie with. He said then, \"There is a relation\r\nbetween thee and me, elder than either thy or my birth, if thou be the\r\ndaughter of Laban; for Abraham was the son of Terah, as well as Haran\r\nand Nahor. Of the last of whom [Nahor] Bethuel thy grandfather was the\r\nson. Isaac my father was the son of Abraham and of Sarah, who was the\r\ndaughter of Haran. But there is a nearer and later cement of mutual\r\nkindred which we bear to one another, for my mother Rebeka was sister to\r\nLaban thy father, both by the same father and mother; I therefore and\r\nthou are cousin-germans. And I am now come to salute you, and to renew\r\nthat affinity which is proper between us.\" Upon this the damsel, at the\r\nmention of Rebeka, as usually happens to young persons, wept, and that\r\nout of the kindness she had for her father, and embraced Jacob, she\r\nhaving learned an account of Rebeka from her father, and knew that her\r\nparents loved to hear her named; and when she had saluted him, she said\r\nthat \"he brought the most desirable and greatest pleasures to her\r\nfather, with all their family, who was always mentioning his mother, and\r\nalways thinking of her, and her alone; and that this will make thee\r\nequal in his eyes to any advantageous circumstances whatsoever.\" Then\r\nshe bid him go to her father, and follow her while she conducted him to\r\nhim; and not to deprive him of such a pleasure, by staying any longer\r\naway from him.\r\n\r\n6. When she had said thus, she brought him to Laban; and being owned by\r\nhis uncle, he was secure himself, as being among his friends; and he\r\nbrought a great deal of pleasure to them by his unexpected coning. But a\r\nlittle while afterward, Laban told him that he could not express in\r\nwords the joy he had at his coming; but still he inquired of him the\r\noccasion of his coming, and why he left his aged mother and father, when\r\nthey wanted to be taken care of by him; and that he would afford him all\r\nthe assistance he wanted. Then Jacob gave him an account of the whole\r\noccasion of his journey, and told him, \"that Isaac had two sons that\r\nwere twins, himself and Esau; who, because he failed of his father's\r\nprayers, which by his mother's wisdom were put up for him, sought to\r\nkill him, as deprived of the kingdom 34 which was to be given him of\r\nGod, and of the blessings for which their father prayed; and that this\r\nwas the occasion of his coming hither, as his mother had commanded him\r\nto do: for we are all [says he] brethren one to another; but our mother\r\nesteems an alliance with your family more than she does one with the\r\nfamilies of the country; so I look upon yourself and God to be the\r\nsupporters of my travels, and think myself safe in my present\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\n7. Now Laban promised to treat him with great humanity, both on account\r\nof his ancestors, and particularly for the sake of his mother, towards\r\nwhom, he said, he would show his kindness, even though she were absent,\r\nby taking care of him; for he assured him he would make him the head\r\nshepherd of his flock, and give him authority sufficient for that\r\npurpose; and when he should have a mind to return to his parents, he\r\nwould send him back with presents, and this in as honorable a manner as\r\nthe nearness of their relation should require. This Jacob heard gladly;\r\nand said he would willingly, and with pleasure, undergo any sort of\r\npains while he tarried with him, but desired Rachel to wife, as the\r\nreward of those pains, who was not only on other accounts esteemed by\r\nhim, but also because she was the means of his coming to him; for he\r\nsaid he was forced by the love of the damsel to make this proposal.\r\nLaban was well pleased with this agreement, and consented to give the\r\ndamsel to him, as not desirous to meet with any better son-in-law; and\r\nsaid he would do this, if he would stay with him some time, for he was\r\nnot willing to send his daughter to be among the Canaanites, for he\r\nrepented of the alliance he had made already by marrying his sister\r\nthere. And when Jacob had given his consent to this, he agreed to stay\r\nseven years; for so many years he had resolved to serve his father-in-\r\nlaw, that, having given a specimen of his virtue, it might be better\r\nknown what sort of a man he was. And Jacob, accepting of his terms,\r\nafter the time was over, he made the wedding-feast; and when it was\r\nnight, without Jacob's perceiving it, he put his other daughter into bed\r\nto him, who was both elder than Rachel, and of no comely countenance:\r\nJacob lay with her that night, as being both in drink and in the dark.\r\nHowever, when it was day, he knew what had been done to him; and he\r\nreproached Laban for his unfair proceeding with him; who asked pardon\r\nfor that necessity which forced him to do what he did; for he did not\r\ngive him Lea out of any ill design, but as overcome by another greater\r\nnecessity: that, notwithstanding this, nothing should hinder him from\r\nmarrying Rachel; but that when he had served another seven years, he\r\nwould give him her whom he loved. Jacob submitted to this condition, for\r\nhis love to the damsel did not permit him to do otherwise; and when\r\nanother seven years were gone, he took Rachel to wife.\r\n\r\n8. Now each of these had handmaids, by their father's donation. Zilpha\r\nwas handmaid to Lea, and Bilha to Rachel; by no means slaves, 35 but\r\nhowever subject to their mistresses. Now Lea was sorely troubled at her\r\nhusband's love to her sister; and she expected she should be better\r\nesteemed if she bare him children: so she entreated God perpetually; and\r\nwhen she had borne a son, and her husband was on that account better\r\nreconciled to her, she named her son Reubel, because God had had mercy\r\nupon her, in giving her a son, for that is the signification of this\r\nname. After some time she bare three more sons; Simeon, which name\r\nsignifies that God had hearkened to her prayer. Then she bare Levi, the\r\nconfirmer of their friendship. After him was born Judah, which denotes\r\nthanksgiving. But Rachel, fearing lest the fruitfulness of her sister\r\nshould make herself enjoy a lesser share of Jacob's affections, put to\r\nbed to him her handmaid Bilha; by whom Jacob had Dan: one may interpret\r\nthat name into the Greek tongue, a divine judgment. And after him\r\nNephthalim, as it were, unconquerable in stratagems, since Rachel tried\r\nto conquer the fruitfulness of her sister by this stratagem.\r\nAccordingly, Lea took the same method, and used a counter-stratagem to\r\nthat of her sister; for she put to bed to him her own handmaid. Jacob\r\ntherefore had by Zilpha a son, whose name was Gad, which may be\r\ninterpreted fortune; and after him Asher, which may be called a happy\r\nman, because he added glory to Lea. Now Reubel, the eldest son of Lea,\r\nbrought apples of mandrakes 36 to his mother. When Rachel saw them, she\r\ndesired that she would give her the apples, for she longed to eat them;\r\nbut when she refused, and bid her be content that she had deprived her\r\nof the benevolence she ought to have had from her husband, Rachel, in\r\norder to mitigate her sister's anger, said she would yield her husband\r\nto her; and he should lie with her that evening. She accepted of the\r\nfavor, and Jacob slept with Lea, by the favor of Rachel. She bare then\r\nthese sons: Issachar, denoting one born by hire: and Zabulon, one born\r\nas a pledge of benevolence towards her; and a daughter, Dina. After some\r\ntime Rachel had a son, named Joseph, which signified there should be\r\nanother added to him.\r\n\r\n9. Now Jacob fed the flocks of Laban his father-in-law all this time,\r\nbeing twenty years, after which he desired leave of his father-in-law to\r\ntake his wives and go home; but when his father-in-law would not give\r\nhim leave, he contrived to do it secretly. He made trial therefore of\r\nthe disposition of his wives what they thought of this journey;—when\r\nthey appeared glad, and approved of it. Rachel took along with her the\r\nimages of the gods, which, according to their laws, they used to worship\r\nin their own country, and ran away together with her sister. The\r\nchildren also of them both, and the handmaids, and what possessions they\r\nhad, went along with them. Jacob also drove away half the cattle,\r\nwithout letting Laban know of it beforehand But the reason why Rachel\r\ntook the images of the gods, although Jacob had taught her to despise\r\nsuch worship of those gods, was this, That in case they were pursued,\r\nand taken by her father, she might have recourse to these images, in\r\norder to obtain his pardon.\r\n\r\n10. But Laban, after one day's time, being acquainted with Jacob's and\r\nhis daughters' departure, was much troubled, and pursued after them,\r\nleading a band of men with him; and on the seventh day overtook them,\r\nand found them resting on a certain hill; and then indeed he did not\r\nmeddle with them, for it was even-tide; but God stood by him in a dream,\r\nand warned him to receive his son-in-law and his daughters in a\r\npeaceable manner; and not to venture upon any thing rashly, or in wrath\r\nto but to make a league with Jacob. And he told him, that if he despised\r\ntheir small number, attacked them in a hostile manner, he would assist\r\nthem. When Laban had been thus forewarned by God, he called Jacob to him\r\nthe next day, in order to treat with him, and showed him what dream he\r\nhad; in dependence whereupon he came confidently to him, and began to\r\naccuse him, alleging that he had entertained him when he was poor, and\r\nin want of all things, and had given him plenty of all things which he\r\nhad. \"For,\" said he, \"I have joined my daughters to thee in marriage,\r\nand supposed that thy kindness to me be greater than before; but thou\r\nhast had no regard to either thy mother's relations to me, nor to the\r\naffinity now newly contracted between us; nor to those wives whom thou\r\nhast married; nor to those children, of whom I am the grandfather. Thou\r\nhast treated me as an enemy, driving away my cattle, and by persuading\r\nmy daughters to run away from their father; and by carrying home those\r\nsacred paternal images which were worshipped by my forefathers, and have\r\nbeen honored with the like worship which they paid them by myself. In\r\nshort, thou hast done this whilst thou art my kinsman, and my sister's\r\nson, and the husband of my daughters, and was hospitably treated by me,\r\nand didst eat at my table.\" When Laban had said this, Jacob made his\r\ndefense—That he was not the only person in whom God had implanted the\r\nlove of his native country, but that he had made it natural to all men;\r\nand that therefore it was but reasonable that, after so long time, he\r\nshould go back to it. \"But as to the prey, of whose driving away thou\r\naccusest me, if any other person were the arbitrator, thou wouldst be\r\nfound in the wrong; for instead of those thanks I ought to have had from\r\nthee, for both keeping thy cattle, and increasing them, how is it that\r\nthou art unjustly angry at me because I have taken, and have with me, a\r\nsmall portion of them? But then, as to thy daughters, take notice, that\r\nit is not through any evil practices of mine that they follow me in my\r\nreturn home, but from that just affection which wives naturally have to\r\ntheir husbands. They follow therefore not so properly myself as their\r\nown children.\" And thus far of his apology was made, in order to clear\r\nhimself of having acted unjustly. To which he added his own complaint\r\nand accusation of Laban; saying, \"While I was thy sister's son, and thou\r\nhadst given me thy daughters in marriage, thou hast worn me out with thy\r\nharsh commands, and detained me twenty years under them. That indeed\r\nwhich was required in order to my marrying thy daughters, hard as it\r\nwas, I own to have been tolerable; but as to those that were put upon me\r\nafter those marriages, they were worse, and such indeed as an enemy\r\nwould have avoided.\" For certainly Laban had used Jacob very ill; for\r\nwhen he saw that God was assisting to Jacob in all that he desired, he\r\npromised him, that of the young cattle which should be born, he should\r\nhave sometimes what was of a white color, and sometimes what should be\r\nof a black color; but when those that came to Jacob's share proved\r\nnumerous, he did not keep his faith with him, but said he would give\r\nthem to him the next year, because of his envying him the multitude of\r\nhis possessions. He promised him as before, because he thought such an\r\nincrease was not to be expected; but when it appeared to be fact, he\r\ndeceived him.\r\n\r\n11. But then, as to the sacred images, he bid him search for them; and\r\nwhen Laban accepted of the offer, Rachel, being informed of it, put\r\nthose images into that camel's saddle on which she rode, and sat upon\r\nit; and said, that her natural purgation hindered her rising up: so\r\nLaban left off searching any further, not supposing that his daughter in\r\nsuch circumstances would approach to those images. So he made a league\r\nwith Jacob, and bound it by oaths, that he would not bear him any malice\r\non account of what had happened; and Jacob made the like league, and\r\npromised to love Laban's daughters. And these leagues they confirmed\r\nwith oaths also, which the made upon certain as whereon they erected a\r\npillar, in the form of an altar: whence that hill is called Gilead; and\r\nfrom thence they call that land the Land of Gilead at this day. Now when\r\nthey had feasted, after the making of the league, Laban returned home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20. Concerning The Meeting Of Jacob And Esau.\r\n\r\n1. Now as Jacob was proceeding on his journey to the land of Canaan,\r\nangels appeared to him, and suggested to him good hope of his future\r\ncondition; and that place he named the Camp of God. And being desirous\r\nof knowing what his brother's intentions were to him, he sent\r\nmessengers, to give him an exact account of every thing, as being\r\nafraid, on account of the enmities between them. He charged those that\r\nwere sent, to say to Esau, \"Jacob had thought it wrong to live together\r\nwith him while he was in anger against him, and so had gone out of the\r\ncountry; and that he now, thinking the length of time of his absence\r\nmust have made up their differences, was returning; that he brought with\r\nhim his wives, and his children, with what possessions he had gotten;\r\nand delivered himself, with what was most dear to him, into his hands;\r\nand should think it his greatest happiness to partake together with his\r\nbrother of what God had bestowed upon him.\" So these messengers told him\r\nthis message. Upon which Esau was very glad, and met his brother with\r\nfour hundred men. And Jacob, when he heard that he was coming to meet\r\nhim with such a number of men, was greatly afraid: however, he committed\r\nhis hope of deliverance to God; and considered how, in his present\r\ncircumstances, he might preserve himself and those that were with him,\r\nand overcome his enemies if they attacked him injuriously. He therefore\r\ndistributed his company into parts; some he sent before the rest, and\r\nthe others he ordered to come close behind, that so, if the first were\r\noverpowered when his brother attacked them, they might have those that\r\nfollowed as a refuge to fly unto. And when he had put his company in\r\nthis order, he sent some of them to carry presents to his brother. The\r\npresents were made up of cattle, and a great number of four-footed\r\nbeasts, of many kinds, such as would be very acceptable to those that\r\nreceived them, on account of their rarity. Those who were sent went at\r\ncertain intervals of space asunder, that, by following thick, one after\r\nanother, they might appear to be more numerous, that Esau might remit of\r\nhis anger on account of these presents, if he were still in a passion.\r\nInstructions were also given to those that were sent to speak gently to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n2. When Jacob had made these appointments all the day, and night came\r\non, he moved on with his company; and, as they were gone over a certain\r\nriver called Jabboc, Jacob was left behind; and meeting with an angel,\r\nhe wrestled with him, the angel beginning the struggle: but he prevailed\r\nover the angel, who used a voice, and spake to him in words, exhorting\r\nhim to be pleased with what had happened to him, and not to suppose that\r\nhis victory was a small one, but that he had overcome a divine angel,\r\nand to esteem the victory as a sign of great blessings that should come\r\nto him, and that his offspring should never fall, and that no man should\r\nbe too hard for his power. He also commanded him to be called Israel,\r\nwhich in the Hebrew tongue signifies one that struggled with the divine\r\nangel. 37 These promises were made at the prayer of Jacob; for when he\r\nperceived him to be the angel of God, he desired he would signify to him\r\nwhat should befall him hereafter. And when the angel had said what is\r\nbefore related, he disappeared; but Jacob was pleased with these things,\r\nand named the place Phanuel, which signifies, the face of God. Now when\r\nhe felt pain, by this struggling, upon his broad sinew, he abstained\r\nfrom eating that sinew himself afterward; and for his sake it is still\r\nnot eaten by us.\r\n\r\n3. When Jacob understood that his brother was near, he ordered his wives\r\nto go before, each by herself, with the handmaids, that they might see\r\nthe actions of the men as they were fighting, if Esau were so disposed.\r\nHe then went up to his brother Esau, and bowed down to him, who had no\r\nevil design upon him, but saluted him; and asked him about the company\r\nof the children and of the women; and desired, when he had understood\r\nall he wanted to know about them, that he would go along with him to\r\ntheir father; but Jacob pretending that the cattle were weary, Esau\r\nreturned to Seir, for there was his place of habitation, he having named\r\nthe place Roughness, from his own hairy roughness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21. Concerning The Violation Of Dina's Chastity.\r\n\r\n1. Hereupon Jacob came to the place, till this day called Tents\r\n[Succoth]; from whence he went to Shechem, which is a city of the\r\nCanaanites. Now as the Shechemites were keeping a festival Dina, who was\r\nthe only daughter of Jacob, went into the city to see the finery of the\r\nwomen of that country. But when Shechem, the son of Hamor the king, saw\r\nher, he defiled her by violence; and being greatly in love with her,\r\ndesired of his father that he would procure the damsel to him for a\r\nwife. To which desire he condescended, and came to Jacob, desiring him\r\nto give leave that his son Shechem might, according to law, marry Dina.\r\nBut Jacob, not knowing how to deny the desire of one of such great\r\ndignity, and yet not thinking it lawful to marry his daughter to a\r\nstranger, entreated him to give him leave to have a consultation about\r\nwhat he desired him to do. So the king went away, in hopes that Jacob\r\nwould grant him this marriage. But Jacob informed his sons of the\r\ndefilement of their sister, and of the address of Hamor; and desired\r\nthem to give their advice what they should do. Upon thiss, the greatest\r\npart said nothing, not knowing what advice to give. But Simeon and Levi,\r\nthe brethren of the damsel by the same mother, agreed between themselves\r\nupon the action following: It being now the time of a festival, when the\r\nShechemites were employed in ease and feasting, they fell upon the watch\r\nwhen they were asleep, and, coming into the city, slew all the males 38\r\nas also the king, and his son, with them; but spared the women. And when\r\nthey had done this without their father's consent, they brought away\r\ntheir sister.\r\n\r\n2. Now while Jacob was astonished at the greatness of this act, and was\r\nseverely blaming his sons for it, God stood by him, and bid him be of\r\ngood courage; but to purify his tents, and to offer those sacrifices\r\nwhich he had vowed to offer when he went first into Mesopotamia, and saw\r\nhis vision. As he was therefore purifying his followers, he lighted upon\r\nthe gods of Laban; [for he did not before know they were stolen by\r\nRachel;] and he hid them in the earth, under an oak, in Shechem. And\r\ndeparting thence, he offered sacrifice at Bethel, the place where he saw\r\nhis dream, when he went first into Mesopotamia.\r\n\r\n3. And when he was gone thence, and was come over against Ephrata, he\r\nthere buried Rachel, who died in child-bed: she was the only one of\r\nJacob's kindred that had not the honor of burial at Hebron. And when he\r\nhad mourned for her a great while, he called the son that was born of\r\nher Benjamin, 39 because of the sorrow the mother had with him. These\r\nare all the children of Jacob, twelve males and one female.--Of them\r\neight were legitimate,--viz. six of Lea, and two of Rachel; and four\r\nwere of the handmaids, two of each; all whose names have been set down\r\nalready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22. How Isaac Died, And Was Buried In Hebron.\r\n\r\nFrom thence Jacob came to Hebron, a city situate among the Canaanites;\r\nand there it was that Isaac lived: and so they lived together for a\r\nlittle while; for as to Rebeka, Jacob did not find her alive. Isaac also\r\ndied not long after the coming of his son; and was buried by his sons,\r\nwith his wife, in Hebron, where they had a monument belonging to them\r\nfrom their forefathers. Now Isaac was a man who was beloved of God, and\r\nwas vouchsafed great instances of providence by God, after Abraham his\r\nfather, and lived to be exceeding old; for when he had lived virtuously\r\none hundred and eighty-five years, he then died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Since Josephus, in his Preface, sect. 4, says that Moses\r\nwrote some things enigmatically, some allegorically, and the rest in\r\nplain words, since in his account of the first chapter of Genesis, and\r\nthe first three verses of the second, he gives us no hints of any\r\nmystery at all; but when he here comes to ver. 4, etc., he says that\r\nMoses, after the seventh day was over, began to talk philosophically; it\r\nis not very improbable that he understood the rest of the second and the\r\nthird chapters in some enigmatical, or allegorical, or philosophical\r\nsense. The change of the name of God just at this place, from Elohim to\r\nJehovah Elohim, from God to Lord God, in the Hebrew, Samaritan, and\r\nSeptuagint, does also not a little favor some such change in the\r\nnarration or construction.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ We may observe here, that Josephus supposed man to be\r\ncompounded of spirit, soul, and body, with St. Paul, 1 Thessalonians\r\n5:23, and the rest of the ancients: he elsewhere says also, that the\r\nblood of animals was forbidden to be eaten, as having in it soul and\r\nspirit, Antiq. B. III. ch. 11. sect. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ Whence this strange notion came, which yet is not peculiar\r\nto Joseph, but, as Dr. Hudson says here, is derived from older authors,\r\nas if four of the greatest rivers in the world, running two of them at\r\nvast distances from the other two, by some means or other watered\r\nparadise, is hard to say. Only since Josephus has already appeared to\r\nallegorize this history, and take notice that these four names had a\r\nparticular signification; Phison for Ganges, a multitude; Phrath for\r\nEuphrates, either a dispersion or a flower; Diglath for Tigris, what is\r\nswift, with narrowness; and Geon for Nile, what arises from the east,—we\r\nperhaps mistake him when we suppose he literally means those four\r\nrivers; especially as to Geon or Nile, which arises from the east, while\r\nhe very well knew the literal Nile arises from the south; though what\r\nfurther allegorical sense he had in view, is now, I fear, impossible to\r\nbe determined.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ By the Red Sea is not here meant the Arabian Gulf, which\r\nalone we now call by that name, but all that South Sea, which included\r\nthe Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf, as far as the East Indies; as Reland\r\nand Hudson here truly note, from the old geographers.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 (return) [ Hence it appears, that Josephus thought several, at least,\r\nof the brute animals, particularly the serpent, could speak before the\r\nfall. And I think few of the more perfect kinds of those animals want\r\nthe organs of speech at this day. Many inducements there are also to a\r\nnotion, that the present state they are in, is not their original state;\r\nand that their capacities have been once much greater than we now see\r\nthem, and are capable of being restored to their former condition. But\r\nas to this most ancient, and authentic, and probably allegorical account\r\nof that grand affair of the fall of our first parents, I have somewhat\r\nmore to say in way of conjecture, but being only a conjecture, I omit\r\nit: only thus far, that the imputation of the sin of our first parents\r\nto their posterity, any further than as some way the cause or occasion\r\nof man's mortality, seems almost entirely groundless; and that both man,\r\nand the other subordinate creatures, are hereafter to be delivered from\r\nthe curse then brought upon them, and at last to be delivered from that\r\nbondage of corruption, Romans 8:19-22.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 (return) [ St. John's account of the reason why God accepted the\r\nsacrifice of Abel, and rejected that of Cain; as also why Cain slew\r\nAbel, on account of that his acceptance with God, is much better than\r\nthis of Josephus: I mean, because \"Cain was of the evil one, and slew\r\nhis brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil,\r\nand his brother's righteous,\" 1 John 3:12. Josephus's reason seems to be\r\nno better than a pharisaical notion or tradition.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 (return) [ From this Jubal, not improbably, came Jobel, the trumpet of\r\njobel or jubilee; that large and loud musical instrument, used in\r\nproclaiming the liberty at the year of jubilee.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8 (return) [ The number of Adam's children, as says the old tradition\r\nwas thirty-three sons, and twenty-three daughters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n9 (return) [ What is here said of Seth and his posterity, that they were\r\nvery good and virtuous, and at the same time very happy, without any\r\nconsiderable misfortunes, for seven generations, [see ch. 2. sect. 1,\r\nbefore; and ch. 3. sect. 1, hereafter,] is exactly agreeable to the\r\nstate of the world and the conduct of Providence in all the first ages.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10 (return) [ Of Josephus's mistake here, when he took Seth the son of\r\nAdam, for Seth or Sesostris, king of Egypt, the erector of this pillar\r\nin the land of Siriad, see Essay on the Old Testament, Appendix, p. 159,\r\n160. Although the main of this relation might be true, and Adam might\r\nforetell a conflagration and a deluge, which all antiquity witnesses to\r\nbe an ancient tradition; nay, Seth's posterity might engrave their\r\ninventions in astronomy on two such pillars; yet it is no way credible\r\nthat they could survive the deluge, which has buried all such pillars\r\nand edifices far under ground in the sediment of its waters, especially\r\nsince the like pillars of the Egyptian Seth or Sesostris were extant\r\nafter the flood, in the land of Siriad, and perhaps in the days of\r\nJosephus also, as is shown in the place here referred to.]\r\n\r\n\r\n11 (return) [ This notion, that the fallen angels were, in some sense,\r\nthe fathers of the old giants, was the constant opinion of antiquity.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12 (return) [ Josephus here supposes that the life of these giants, for\r\nof them only do I understand him, was now reduced to 120 years; which is\r\nconfirmed by the fragment of Enoch, sect. 10, in Authent. Rec. Part I.\r\np. 268. For as to the rest of mankind, Josephus himself confesses their\r\nlives were much longer than 120 years, for many generations after the\r\nflood, as we shall see presently; and he says they were gradually\r\nshortened till the days of Moses, and then fixed [for some time] at 120,\r\nch. 6. sect. 5. Nor indeed need we suppose that either Enoch or Josephus\r\nmeant to interpret these 120 years for the life of men before the flood,\r\nto be different from the 120 years of God's patience [perhaps while the\r\nark was preparing] till the deluge; which I take to be the meaning of\r\nGod when he threatened this wicked world, that if they so long continued\r\nimpenitent, their days should be no more than 120 years.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13 (return) [ A cubit is about 21 English inches.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14 (return) [ Josephus here truly determines, that the year at the Flood\r\nbegan about the autumnal equinox. As to what day of the month the Flood\r\nbegan, our Hebrew and Samaritan, and perhaps Josephus's own copy, more\r\nrightly placed it on the 17th day, instead of the 27th, as here; for\r\nJosephus agrees with them, as to the distance of 150 days to the 17th\r\nday of the 7th month, as Genesis 7. ult. with 8:3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15 (return) [ Josephus here takes notice, that these ancient genealogies\r\nwere first set down by those that then lived, and from them were\r\ntransmitted down to posterity; which I suppose to be the true account of\r\nthat matter. For there is no reason to imagine that men were not taught\r\nto read and write soon after they were taught to speak; and perhaps all\r\nby the Messiah himself, who, under the Father, was the Creator or\r\nGovernor of mankind, and who frequently in those early days appeared to\r\nthem.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 (return) [ This [GREEK], or Place of Descent, is the proper rendering\r\nof the Armenian name of this very city. It is called in Ptolemy Naxuana,\r\nand by Moses Chorenensis, the Armenian historian, Idsheuan; but at the\r\nplace itself Nachidsheuan, which signifies The first place of descent,\r\nand is a lasting monument of the preservation of Noah in the ark, upon\r\nthe top of that mountain, at whose foot it was built, as the first city\r\nor town after the flood. See Antiq. B. XX. ch. 2. sect. 3; and Moses\r\nChorenensis, who also says elsewhere, that another town was related by\r\ntradition to have been called Seron, or, The Place of Dispersion, on\r\naccount of the dispersion of Xisuthrus's or Noah's sons, from thence\r\nfirst made. Whether any remains of this ark be still preserved, as the\r\npeople of the country suppose, I cannot certainly tell. Mons. Tournefort\r\nhad, not very long since, a mind to see the place himself, but met with\r\ntoo great dangers and difficulties to venture through them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n17 (return) [ One observation ought not here to be neglected, with\r\nregard to that Ethiopic war which Moses, as general of the Egyptians,\r\nput an end to, Antiq. B. II. ch. 10., and about which our late writers\r\nseem very much unconcerned; viz. that it was a war of that consequence,\r\nas to occasion the removal or destruction of six or seven nations of the\r\nposterity of Mitzraim, with their cities; which Josephus would not have\r\nsaid, if he had not had ancient records to justify those his assertions,\r\nthough those records be now all lost.]\r\n\r\n\r\n18 (return) [ That the Jews were called Hebrews from this their\r\nprogenitor Heber, our author Josephus here rightly affirms; and not from\r\nAbram the Hebrew, or passenger over Euphrates, as many of the moderns\r\nsuppose. Shem is also called the father of all the children of Heber, or\r\nof all the Hebrews, in a history long before Abram passed over\r\nEuphrates, Genesis 10:21, though it must be confessed that, Genesis\r\n14:13, where the original says they told Abram the Hebrew, the\r\nSeptuagint renders it the passenger, [GREEK]: but this is spoken only of\r\nAbram himself, who had then lately passed over Euphrates, and is another\r\nsignification of the Hebrew word, taken as an appellative, and not as a\r\nproper name.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19 (return) [ It is worth noting here, that God required no other\r\nsacrifices under the law of Moses, than what were taken from these five\r\nkinds of animals which he here required of Abram.

Its remote situation, at the\r\nmost southern point of the Sea of Sodom, in the wild and dangerous\r\ndeserts of Arabia, makes it exceeding difficult for inquisitive\r\ntravelers to examine the place; and for common reports of country\r\npeople, at a distance, they are not very satisfactory. In the mean time,\r\nI have no opinion of Le Clerc's dissertation or hypothesis about this\r\nquestion, which can only be determined by eye-witnesses. When Christian\r\nprinces, so called, lay aside their foolish and unchristian wars and\r\nquarrels, and send a body of fit persons to travel over the east, and\r\nbring us faithful accounts of all ancient monuments, and procure us\r\ncopies of all ancient records, at present lost among us, we may hope for\r\nfull satisfaction in such inquiries; but hardly before.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24 (return) [ I see no proper wicked intention in these daughters of\r\nLot, when in a case which appeared to them of unavoidable necessity,\r\nthey procured themselves to be with child by their father.

In the mean time,\r\ntheir making their father drunk, and their solicitous concealment of\r\nwhat they did from him, shows that they despaired of persuading him to\r\nan action which, at the best, could not but be very suspicious and\r\nshocking to so good a man.]\r\n\r\n\r\n25 (return) [ It is well worth observation, that Josephus here calls\r\nthat principal Angel, who appeared to Abraham and foretold the birth of\r\nIsaac, directly God; which language of Josephus here, prepares us to\r\nbelieve those other expressions of his, that Jesus was a wise man, if it\r\nbe lawful to call him a man, Antiq.

He saith not, and of\r\nseeds, as of many, but as of one; and to thy seed, which is Christ,\"\r\nGalatians 3:16. Nor is it any wonder, he being, I think, as yet not a\r\nChristian. And had he been a Christian, yet since he was, to be sure,\r\ntill the latter part of his life, no more than an Ebionite Christian,\r\nwho, above all the apostles, rejected and despised St. Paul, it would be\r\nno great wonder if he did not now follow his interpretation. In the mean\r\ntime, we have in effect St. Paul's exposition in the Testament of\r\nReuben, sect. 6, in Authent. Rec. Part I. p. 302, who charges his sons\r\n\"to worship the seed of Judah, who should die for them in visible and\r\ninvisible wars; and should be among them an eternal king.\" Nor is that\r\nobservation of a learned foreigner of my acquaintance to be despised,\r\nwho takes notice, that as seeds in the plural, must signify posterity,\r\nso seed in the singular may signify either posterity, or a single\r\nperson; and that in this promise of all nations being happy in the seed\r\nof Abraham, or Isaac, or Jacob, etc., it is always used in the singular.\r\nTo which I shall add, that it is sometimes, as it were, paraphrased by\r\nthe son of Abraham, the son of David, etc., which is capable of no such\r\nambiguity.]\r\n\r\n\r\n30 (return) [ The birth of Jacob and Esau is here said to be after\r\nAbraham's death: it should have been after Sarah's death.

Whence it must be,\r\nthat when Isaac had unwittingly blessed Jacob, and was afterwards made\r\nsensible of his mistake, yet did he not attempt to alter it, how\r\nearnestly soever his affection for Esau might incline him to wish it\r\nmight be altered, because he knew that this blessing came not from\r\nhimself, but from God, and that an alteration was out of his power.

However\r\nthe blessing being delivered as a prediction of future events, by a\r\nDivine impulse, and foretelling things to befall to the posterity of\r\nJacob and Esau in future ages, was for certain providential; and\r\naccording to what Rebeka knew to be the purpose of God, when he answered\r\nher inquiry, \"before the children were born,\" Genesis 25:23, \"that one\r\npeople should be stronger than the other people; and the elder, Esau,\r\nshould serve the younger, Jacob.\" Whether Isaac knew or remembered this\r\nold oracle, delivered in our copies only to Rebeka; or whether, if he\r\nknew and remembered it, he did not endeavor to alter the Divine\r\ndetermination, out of his fondness for his elder and worser son Esau, to\r\nthe damage of his younger and better son Jacob, as Josephus elsewhere\r\nsupposes, Antiq. B. II. ch. 7. sect. 3; I cannot certainly say. If so,\r\nthis might tempt Rebeka to contrive, and Jacob to put this imposition\r\nupon him. However, Josephus says here, that it was Isaac, and not\r\nRebeka, who inquired of God at first, and received the forementioned\r\noracle, sect. 1; which, if it be the true reading, renders Isaac's\r\nprocedure more inexcusable.

How Esau And Jacob, Isaac's Sons Divided Their Habitation;\r\nAnd Esau Possessed Idumea And Jacob Canaan.\r\n\r\n1. After the death of Isaac, his sons divided their habitations\r\nrespectively; nor did they retain what they had before; but Esau\r\ndeparted from the city of Hebron, and left it to his brother, and dwelt\r\nin Seir, and ruled over Idumea. He called the country by that name from\r\nhimself, for he was named Adom; which appellation he got on the\r\nfollowing occasion:—One day returning from the toil of hunting very\r\nhungry, [it was when he was a child in age,] he lighted on his brother\r\nwhen he was getting ready lentile-pottage for his dinner, which was of a\r\nvery red color; on which account he the more earnestly longed for it,\r\nand desired him to give him some of it to eat: but he made advantage of\r\nhis brother's hunger, and forced him to resign up to him his birthright;\r\nand he, being pinched with famine, resigned it up to him, under an oath.\r\nWhence it came, that, on account of the redness of this pottage, he was,\r\nin way of jest, by his contemporaries, called Adom, for the Hebrews call\r\nwhat is red Adom; and this was the name given to the country; but the\r\nGreeks gave it a more agreeable pronunciation, and named it Idumea.\r\n\r\n2. He became the father of five sons; of whom Jaus, and Jalomus, and\r\nCoreus, were by one wife, whose name was Alibama; but of the rest,\r\nAliphaz was born to him by Ada, and Raguel by Basemmath: and these were\r\nthe sons of Esau. Aliphaz had five legitimate sons; Theman, Omer,\r\nSaphus, Gotham, and Kanaz; for Amalek was not legitimate, but by a\r\nconcubine, whose name was Thamna. These dwelt in that part of Idumea\r\nwhich is called Gebalitis, and that denominated from Amalek, Amalekitis;\r\nfor Idumea was a large country, and did then preserve the name of the\r\nwhole, while in its several parts it kept the names of its peculiar\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How Joseph, The Youngest Of Jacob's Sons, Was Envied By His\r\nBrethren, When Certain Dreams Had Foreshown His Future Happiness.\r\n\r\n1. It happened that Jacob came to so great happiness as rarely any other\r\nperson had arrived at. He was richer than the rest of the inhabitants of\r\nthat country; and was at once envied and admired for such virtuous sons,\r\nfor they were deficient in nothing, but were of great souls, both for\r\nlaboring with their hands and enduring of toil; and shrewd also in\r\nunderstanding. And God exercised such a providence over him, and such a\r\ncare of his happiness, as to bring him the greatest blessings, even out\r\nof what appeared to be the most sorrowful condition; and to make him the\r\ncause of our forefathers' departure out of Egypt, him and his posterity.\r\nThe occasion was this:—When Jacob had his son Joseph born to him by\r\nRachel, his father loved him above the rest of his sons, both because of\r\nthe beauty of his body, and the virtues of his mind, for he excelled the\r\nrest in prudence. This affection of his father excited the envy and the\r\nhatred of his brethren; as did also his dreams which he saw, and related\r\nto his father, and to them, which foretold his future happiness, it\r\nbeing usual with mankind to envy their very nearest relations such their\r\nprosperity. Now the visions which Joseph saw in his sleep were these:—\r\n\r\n2. When they were in the middle of harvest, and Joseph was sent by his\r\nfather, with his brethren, to gather the fruits of the earth, he saw a\r\nvision in a dream, but greatly exceeding the customary appearances that\r\ncome when we are asleep; which, when he was got up, he told his\r\nbrethren, that they might judge what it portended. He said, he saw the\r\nlast night, that his wheat-sheaf stood still in the place where he set\r\nit, but that their sheaves ran to bow down to it, as servants bow down\r\nto their masters. But as soon as they perceived the vision foretold that\r\nhe should obtain power and great wealth, and that his power should be in\r\nopposition to them, they gave no interpretation of it to Joseph, as if\r\nthe dream were not by them understood: but they prayed that no part of\r\nwhat they suspected to be its meaning might come to pass; and they bare\r\na still greater hatred to him on that account.\r\n\r\n3. But God, in opposition to their envy, sent a second vision to Joseph,\r\nwhich was much more wonderful than the former; for it seemed to him that\r\nthe sun took with him the moon, and the rest of the stars, and came down\r\nto the earth, and bowed down to him. He told the vision to his father,\r\nand that, as suspecting nothing of ill-will from his brethren, when they\r\nwere there also, and desired him to interpret what it should signify.\r\nNow Jacob was pleased with the dream: for, considering the prediction in\r\nhis mind, and shrewdly and wisely guessing at its meaning, he rejoiced\r\nat the great things thereby signified, because it declared the future\r\nhappiness of his son; and that, by the blessing of God, the time would\r\ncome when he should be honored, and thought worthy of worship by his\r\nparents and brethren, as guessing that the moon and sun were like his\r\nmother and father; the former, as she that gave increase and nourishment\r\nto all things; and the latter, he that gave form and other powers to\r\nthem; and that the stars were like his brethren, since they were eleven\r\nin number, as were the stars that receive their power from the sun and\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\n4. And thus did Jacob make a judgment of this vision, and that a shrewd\r\none also. But these interpretations caused very great grief to Joseph's\r\nbrethren; and they were affected to him hereupon as if he were a certain\r\nstranger, that was to those good things which were signified by the\r\ndreams and not as one that was a brother, with whom it was probable they\r\nshould be joint-partakers; and as they had been partners in the same\r\nparentage, so should they be of the same happiness. They also resolved\r\nto kill the lad; and having fully ratified that intention of theirs, as\r\nsoon as their collection of the fruits was over, they went to Shechem,\r\nwhich is a country good for feeding of cattle, and for pasturage; there\r\nthey fed their flocks, without acquainting their father with their\r\nremoval thither; whereupon he had melancholy suspicions about them, as\r\nbeing ignorant of his sons' condition, and receiving no messenger from\r\nthe flocks that could inform him of the true state they were in; so,\r\nbecause he was in great fear about them, he sent Joseph to the flocks,\r\nto learn the circumstances his brethren were in, and to bring him word\r\nhow they did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How Joseph Was Thus Sold By His Brethren Into Egypt, By\r\nReason Of Their Hatred To Him; And How He There Grew Famous And\r\nIllustrious And Had His Brethren Under His Power.\r\n\r\n1. Now these brethren rejoiced as soon as they saw their brother coming\r\nto them, not indeed as at the presence of a near relation, or as at the\r\npresence of one sent by their father, but as at the presence of an\r\nenemy, and one that by Divine Providence was delivered into their hands;\r\nand they already resolved to kill him, and not let slip the opportunity\r\nthat lay before them. But when Reubel, the eldest of them, saw them thus\r\ndisposed, and that they had agreed together to execute their purpose, he\r\ntried to restrain them, showing them the heinous enterprise they were\r\ngoing about, and the horrid nature of it; that this action would appear\r\nwicked in the sight of God, and impious before men, even though they\r\nshould kill one not related to them; but much more flagitious and\r\ndetestable to appear to have slain their own brother, by which act the\r\nfather must be treated unjustly in the son's slaughter, and the mother 1\r\nalso be in perplexity while she laments that her son is taken away from\r\nher, and this not in a natural way neither. So he entreated them to have\r\na regard to their own consciences, and wisely to consider what mischief\r\nwould betide them upon the death of so good a child, and their youngest\r\nbrother; that they would also fear God, who was already both a spectator\r\nand a witness of the designs they had against their brother; that he\r\nwould love them if they abstained from this act, and yielded to\r\nrepentance and amendment; but in case they proceeded to do the fact, all\r\nsorts of punishments would overtake them from God for this murder of\r\ntheir brother, since they polluted his providence, which was every where\r\npresent, and which did not overlook what was done, either in deserts or\r\nin cities; for wheresoever a man is, there ought he to suppose that God\r\nis also. He told them further, that their consciences would be their\r\nenemies, if they attempted to go through so wicked an enterprise, which\r\nthey can never avoid, whether it be a good conscience; or whether it be\r\nsuch a one as they will have within them when once they have killed\r\ntheir brother. He also added this besides to what he had before said,\r\nthat it was not a righteous thing to kill a brother, though he had\r\ninjured them; that it is a good thing to forget the actions of such near\r\nfriends, even in things wherein they might seem to have offended; but\r\nthat they were going to kill Joseph, who had been guilty of nothing that\r\nwas ill towards them, in whose case the infirmity of his small age\r\nshould rather procure him mercy, and move them to unite together in the\r\ncare of his preservation. That the cause of killing him made the act\r\nitself much worse, while they determined to take him off out of envy at\r\nhis future prosperity, an equal share of which they would naturally\r\npartake while he enjoyed it, since they were to him not strangers, but\r\nthe nearest relations, for they might reckon upon what God bestowed upon\r\nJoseph as their own; and that it was fit for them to believe, that the\r\nanger of God would for this cause be more severe upon them, if they slew\r\nhim who was judged by God to be worthy of that prosperity which was to\r\nbe hoped for; and while, by murdering him, they made it impossible for\r\nGod to bestow it upon him.\r\n\r\n2. Reubel said these and many other things, and used entreaties to them,\r\nand thereby endeavored to divert them from the murder of their brother.\r\nBut when he saw that his discourse had not mollified them at all, and\r\nthat they made haste to do the fact, he advised them to alleviate the\r\nwickedness they were going about, in the manner of taking Joseph off;\r\nfor as he had exhorted them first, when they were going to revenge\r\nthemselves, to be dissuaded from doing it; so, since the sentence for\r\nkilling their brother had prevailed, he said that they would not,\r\nhowever, be so grossly guilty, if they would be persuaded to follow his\r\npresent advice, which would include what they were so eager about, but\r\nwas not so very bad, but, in the distress they were in, of a lighter\r\nnature. He begged of them, therefore, not to kill their brother with\r\ntheir own hands, but to cast him into the pit that was hard by, and so\r\nto let him die; by which they would gain so much, that they would not\r\ndefile their own hands with his blood. To this the young men readily\r\nagreed; so Reubel took the lad and tied him to a cord, and let him down\r\ngently into the pit, for it had no water at all in it; who, when he had\r\ndone this, went his way to seek for such pasturage as was fit for\r\nfeeding his flocks.\r\n\r\n3. But Judas, being one of Jacob's sons also, seeing some Arabians, of\r\nthe posterity of Ismael, carrying spices and Syrian wares out of the\r\nland of Gilead to the Egyptians, after Rubel was gone, advised his\r\nbrethren to draw Joseph out of the pit, and sell him to the Arabians;\r\nfor if he should die among strangers a great way off, they should be\r\nfreed from this barbarous action. This, therefore, was resolved on; so\r\nthey drew Joseph up out of the pit, and sold him to the merchants for\r\ntwenty pounds 2 He was now seventeen years old. But Reubel, coming in\r\nthe night-time to the pit, resolved to save Joseph, without the privity\r\nof his brethren; and when, upon his calling to him, he made no answer,\r\nhe was afraid that they had destroyed him after he was gone; of which he\r\ncomplained to his brethren; but when they had told him what they had\r\ndone, Reubel left off his mourning.\r\n\r\n4. When Joseph's brethren had done thus to him, they considered what\r\nthey should do to escape the suspicions of their father. Now they had\r\ntaken away from Joseph the coat which he had on when he came to them at\r\nthe time they let him down into the pit; so they thought proper to tear\r\nthat coat to pieces, and to dip it into goats' blood, and then to carry\r\nit and show it to their father, that he might believe he was destroyed\r\nby wild beasts. And when they had so done, they came to the old man, but\r\nthis not till what had happened to his son had already come to his\r\nknowledge. Then they said that they had not seen Joseph, nor knew what\r\nmishap had befallen him; but that they had found his coat bloody and\r\ntorn to pieces, whence they had a suspicion that he had fallen among\r\nwild beasts, and so perished, if that was the coat he had on when he\r\ncame from home. Now Jacob had before some better hopes that his son was\r\nonly made a captive; but now he laid aside that notion, and supposed\r\nthat this coat was an evident argument that he was dead, for he well\r\nremembered that this was the coat he had on when he sent him to his\r\nbrethren; so he hereafter lamented the lad as now dead, and as if he had\r\nbeen the father of no more than one, without taking any comfort in the\r\nrest; and so he was also affected with his misfortune before he met with\r\nJoseph's brethren, when he also conjectured that Joseph was destroyed by\r\nwild beasts. He sat down also clothed in sackcloth and in heavy\r\naffliction, insomuch that he found no ease when his sons comforted him,\r\nneither did his pains remit by length of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. Concerning The Signal Chastity Of Joseph.\r\n\r\n1. Now Potiphar, an Egyptian, who was chief cook to king Pharaoh, bought\r\nJoseph of the merchants, who sold him to him. He had him in the greatest\r\nhonor, and taught him the learning that became a free man, and gave him\r\nleave to make use of a diet better than was allotted to slaves. He\r\nintrusted also the care of his house to him. So he enjoyed these\r\nadvantages, yet did not he leave that virtue which he had before, upon\r\nsuch a change of his condition; but he demonstrated that wisdom was able\r\nto govern the uneasy passions of life, in such as have it in reality,\r\nand do not only put it on for a show, under a present state of\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\n2. For when his master's wife was fallen in love with him, both on\r\naccount of his beauty of body, and his dexterous management of affairs;\r\nand supposed, that if she should make it known to him, she could easily\r\npersuade him to come and lie with her, and that he would look upon it as\r\na piece of happy fortune that his mistress should entreat him, as\r\nregarding that state of slavery he was in, and not his moral character,\r\nwhich continued after his condition was changed. So she made known her\r\nnaughty inclinations, and spake to him about lying with her. However, he\r\nrejected her entreaties, not thinking it agreeable to religion to yield\r\nso far to her, as to do what would tend to the affront and injury of him\r\nthat purchased him, and had vouchsafed him so great honors. He, on the\r\ncontrary, exhorted her to govern that passion; and laid before her the\r\nimpossibility of her obtaining her desires, which he thought might be\r\nconquered, if she had no hope of succeeding; and he said, that as to\r\nhimself, he would endure any thing whatever before he would be persuaded\r\nto it; for although it was fit for a slave, as he was, to do nothing\r\ncontrary to his mistress, he might well be excused in a case where the\r\ncontradiction was to such sort of commands only. But this opposition of\r\nJoseph, when she did not expect it, made her still more violent in her\r\nlove to him; and as she was sorely beset with this naughty passion, so\r\nshe resolved to compass her design by a second attempt.\r\n\r\n3. When, therefore, there was a public festival coming on, in which it\r\nwas the custom for women to come to the public solemnity; she pretended\r\nto her husband that she was sick, as contriving an opportunity for\r\nsolitude and leisure, that she might entreat Joseph again. Which\r\nopportunity being obtained, she used more kind words to him than before;\r\nand said that it had been good for him to have yielded to her first\r\nsolicitation, and to have given her no repulse, both because of the\r\nreverence he ought to bear to her dignity who solicited him, and because\r\nof the vehemence of her passion, by which she was forced though she were\r\nhis mistress to condescend beneath her dignity; but that he may now, by\r\ntaking more prudent advice, wipe off the imputation of his former folly;\r\nfor whether it were that he expected the repetition of her solicitations\r\nshe had now made, and that with greater earnestness than before, for\r\nthat she had pretended sickness on this very account, and had preferred\r\nhis conversation before the festival and its solemnity; or whether he\r\nopposed her former discourses, as not believing she could be in earnest;\r\nshe now gave him sufficient security, by thus repeating her application,\r\nthat she meant not in the least by fraud to impose upon him; and assured\r\nhim, that if he complied with her affections, he might expect the\r\nenjoyment of the advantages he already had; and if he were submissive to\r\nher, he should have still greater advantages; but that he must look for\r\nrevenge and hatred from her, in case he rejected her desires, and\r\npreferred the reputation of chastity before his mistress; for that he\r\nwould gain nothing by such procedure, because she would then become his\r\naccuser, and would falsely pretend to her husband, that he had attempted\r\nher chastity; and that Potiphar would hearken to her words rather than\r\nto his, let his be ever so agreeable to the truth.\r\n\r\n4. When the woman had said thus, and even with tears in her eyes,\r\nneither did pity dissuade Joseph from his chastity, nor did fear compel\r\nhim to a compliance with her; but he opposed her solicitations, and did\r\nnot yield to her threatenings, and was afraid to do an ill thing, and\r\nchose to undergo the sharpest punishment rather than to enjoy his\r\npresent advantages, by doing what his own conscience knew would justly\r\ndeserve that he should die for it. He also put her in mind that she was\r\na married woman, and that she ought to cohabit with her husband only;\r\nand desired her to suffer these considerations to have more weight with\r\nher than the short pleasure of lustful dalliance, which would bring her\r\nto repentance afterwards, would cause trouble to her, and yet would not\r\namend what had been done amiss. He also suggested to her the fear she\r\nwould be in lest they should be caught; and that the advantage of\r\nconcealment was uncertain, and that only while the wickedness was not\r\nknown [would there be any quiet for them]; but that she might have the\r\nenjoyment of her husband's company without any danger. And he told her,\r\nthat in the company of her husband she might have great boldness from a\r\ngood conscience, both before God and before men. Nay, that she would act\r\nbetter like his mistress, and make use of her authority over him better\r\nwhile she persisted in her chastity, than when they were both ashamed\r\nfor what wickedness they had been guilty of; and that it is much better\r\nto a life, well and known to have been so, than upon the hopes of the\r\nconcealment of evil practices.\r\n\r\n5. Joseph, by saying this, and more, tried to restrain the violent\r\npassion of the woman, and to reduce her affections within the rules of\r\nreason; but she grew more ungovernable and earnest in the matter; and\r\nsince she despaired of persuading him, she laid her hands upon him, and\r\nhad a mind to force him. But as soon as Joseph had got away from her\r\nanger, leaving also his garment with her, for he left that to her, and\r\nleaped out of her chamber, she was greatly afraid lest he should\r\ndiscover her lewdness to her husband, and greatly troubled at the\r\naffront he had offered her; so she resolved to be beforehand with him,\r\nand to accuse Joseph falsely to Potiphar, and by that means to revenge\r\nherself on him for his pride and contempt of her; and she thought it a\r\nwise thing in itself, and also becoming a woman, thus to prevent his\r\naccusation. Accordingly she sat sorrowful and in confusion, framing\r\nherself so hypocritically and angrily, that the sorrow, which was really\r\nfor her being disappointed of her lust, might appear to be for the\r\nattempt upon her chastity; so that when her husband came home, and was\r\ndisturbed at the sight of her and inquired what was the cause of the\r\ndisorder she was in, she began to accuse Joseph: and, \"O husband,\" said\r\nshe, \"mayst thou not live a day longer if thou dost not punish the\r\nwicked slave who has desired to defile thy bed; who has neither minded\r\nwho he was when he came to our house, so as to behave himself with\r\nmodesty; nor has he been mindful of what favors he had received from thy\r\nbounty [as he must be an ungrateful man indeed, unless he, in every\r\nrespect, carry himself in a manner agreeable to us]: this man, I say,\r\nlaid a private design to abuse thy wife, and this at the time of a\r\nfestival, observing when thou wouldst be absent. So that it now is clear\r\nthat his modesty, as it appeared to be formerly, was only because of the\r\nrestraint he was in out of fear of thee, but that he was not really of a\r\ngood disposition. This has been occasioned by his being advanced to\r\nhonor beyond what he deserved, and what he hoped for; insomuch that he\r\nconcluded, that he who was deemed fit to be trusted with thy estate and\r\nthe government of thy family, and was preferred above thy eldest\r\nservants, might be allowed to touch thy wife also.\" Thus when she had\r\nended her discourse, she showed him his garment, as if he then left it\r\nwith her when he attempted to force her. But Potiphar not being able to\r\ndisbelieve what his wife's tears showed, and what his wife said, and\r\nwhat he saw himself, and being seduced by his love to his wife, did not\r\nset himself about the examination of the truth; but taking it for\r\ngranted that his wife was a modest woman, and condemning Joseph as a\r\nwicked man, he threw him into the malefactors' prison; and had a still\r\nhigher opinion of his wife, and bare her witness that she was a woman of\r\na becoming modesty and chastity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. What Things Befell Joseph In Prison.\r\n\r\n1. Now Joseph, commending all his affairs to God, did not betake himself\r\nto make his defense, nor to give an account of the exact circumstances\r\nof the fact, but silently underwent the bonds and the distress he was\r\nin, firmly believing that God, who knew the cause of his affliction, and\r\nthe truth of the fact, would be more powerful than those that inflicted\r\nthe punishments upon him:—a proof of whose providence he quickly\r\nreceived; for the keeper of the prison taking notice of his care and\r\nfidelity in the affairs he had set him about, and the dignity of his\r\ncountenance, relaxed his bonds, and thereby made his heavy calamity\r\nlighter, and more supportable to him. He also permitted him to make use\r\nof a diet better than that of the rest of the prisoners. Now, as his\r\nfellow prisoners, when their hard labors were over, fell to discoursing\r\none among another, as is usual in such as are equal sufferers, and to\r\ninquire one of another what were the occasions of their being condemned\r\nto a prison: among them the king's cupbearer, and one that had been\r\nrespected by him, was put in bonds, upon the king's anger at him. This\r\nman was under the same bonds with Joseph, and grew more familiar with\r\nhim; and upon his observing that Joseph had a better understanding than\r\nthe rest had, he told him of a dream he had, and desired he would\r\ninterpret its meaning, complaining that, besides the afflictions he\r\nunderwent from the king, God did also add to him trouble from his\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\n2. He therefore said, that in his sleep he saw three clusters of grapes\r\nhanging upon three branches of a vine, large already, and ripe for\r\ngathering; and that he squeezed them into a cup which the king held in\r\nhis hand; and when he had strained the wine, he gave it to the king to\r\ndrink, and that he received it from him with a pleasant countenance.\r\nThis, he said, was what he saw; and he desired Joseph, that if he had\r\nany portion of understanding in such matters, he would tell him what\r\nthis vision foretold. Who bid him be of good cheer, and expect to be\r\nloosed from his bonds in three days' time, because the king desired his\r\nservice, and was about to restore him to it again; for he let him know\r\nthat God bestows the fruit of the vine upon men for good; which wine is\r\npoured out to him, and is the pledge of fidelity and mutual confidence\r\namong men; and puts an end to their quarrels, takes away passion and\r\ngrief out of the minds of them that use it, and makes them cheerful.\r\n\"Thou sayest that thou didst squeeze this wine from three clusters of\r\ngrapes with thine hands, and that the king received it: know, therefore,\r\nthat this vision is for thy good, and foretells a release from thy\r\npresent distress within the same number of days as the branches had\r\nwhence thou gatheredst thy grapes in thy sleep. However, remember what\r\nprosperity I have foretold thee when thou hast found it true by\r\nexperience; and when thou art in authority, do not overlook us in this\r\nprison, wherein thou wilt leave us when thou art gone to the place we\r\nhave foretold; for we are not in prison for any crime; but for the sake\r\nof our virtue and sobriety are we condemned to suffer the penalty of\r\nmalefactors, and because we are not willing to injure him that has thus\r\ndistressed us, though it were for our own pleasure.\" The cupbearer,\r\ntherefore, as was natural to do, rejoiced to hear such an interpretation\r\nof his dream, and waited the completion of what had been thus shown him\r\nbeforehand.\r\n\r\n3. But another servant there was of the king, who had been chief baker,\r\nand was now bound in prison with the cupbearer; he also was in good\r\nhope, upon Joseph's interpretation of the other's vision, for he had\r\nseen a dream also; so he desired that Joseph would tell him what the\r\nvisions he had seen the night before might mean. They were these that\r\nfollow:—\"Methought,\" says he, \"I carried three baskets upon my head; two\r\nwere full of loaves, and the third full of sweetmeats and other\r\neatables, such as are prepared for kings; but that the fowls came\r\nflying, and eat them all up, and had no regard to my attempt to drive\r\nthem away.\" And he expected a prediction like to that of the cupbearer.\r\nBut Joseph, considering and reasoning about the dream, said to him, that\r\nhe would willingly be an interpreter of good events to him, and not of\r\nsuch as his dream denounced to him; but he told him that he had only\r\nthree days in all to live, for that the [three] baskets signify, that on\r\nthe third day he should be crucified, and devoured by fowls, while he\r\nwas not able to help himself. Now both these dreams had the same several\r\nevents that Joseph foretold they should have, and this to both the\r\nparties; for on the third day before mentioned, when the king solemnized\r\nhis birth-day, he crucified the chief baker, but set the butler free\r\nfrom his bonds, and restored him to his former ministration.\r\n\r\n4. But God freed Joseph from his confinement, after he had endured his\r\nbonds two years, and had received no assistance from the cupbearer, who\r\ndid not remember what he had said to him formerly; and God contrived\r\nthis method of deliverance for him. Pharaoh the king had seen in his\r\nsleep the same evening two visions; and after them had the\r\ninterpretations of them both given him. He had forgotten the latter, but\r\nretained the dreams themselves. Being therefore troubled at what he had\r\nseen, for it seemed to him to be all of a melancholy nature, the next\r\nday he called together the wisest men among the Egyptians, desiring to\r\nlearn from them the interpretation of his dreams. But when they\r\nhesitated about them, the king was so much the more disturbed. And now\r\nit was that the memory of Joseph, and his skill in dreams, came into the\r\nmind of the king's cupbearer, when he saw the confusion that Pharaoh was\r\nin; so he came and mentioned Joseph to him, as also the vision he had\r\nseen in prison, and how the event proved as he had said; as also that\r\nthe chief baker was crucified on the very same day; and that this also\r\nhappened to him according to the interpretation of Joseph. That Joseph\r\nhimself was laid in bonds by Potiphar, who was his head cook, as a\r\nslave; but, he said, he was one of the noblest of the stock of the\r\nHebrews; and said further, his father lived in great splendor. \"If,\r\ntherefore, thou wilt send for him, and not despise him on the score of\r\nhis misfortunes, thou wilt learn what thy dreams signify.\" So the king\r\ncommanded that they should bring Joseph into his presence; and those who\r\nreceived the command came and brought him with them, having taken care\r\nof his habit, that it might be decent, as the king had enjoined them to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n5. But the king took him by the hand; and, \"O young man,\" says he, \"for\r\nmy servant bears witness that thou art at present the best and most\r\nskillful person I can consult with; vouchsafe me the same favors which\r\nthou bestowedst on this servant of mine, and tell me what events they\r\nare which the visions of my dreams foreshow; and I desire thee to\r\nsuppress nothing out of fear, nor to flatter me with lying words, or\r\nwith what may please me, although the truth should be of a melancholy\r\nnature. For it seemed to me that, as I walked by the river, I saw kine\r\nfat and very large, seven in number, going from the river to the\r\nmarshes; and other kine of the same number like them, met them out of\r\nthe marshes, exceeding lean and ill-favored, which ate up the fat and\r\nthe large kine, and yet were no better than before, and not less\r\nmiserably pinched with famine. After I had seen this vision, I awaked\r\nout of my sleep; and being in disorder, and considering with myself what\r\nthis appearance should be, I fell asleep again, and saw another dream,\r\nmuch more wonderful than the foregoing, which still did more affright\r\nand disturb me:—I saw seven ears of corn growing out of one root, having\r\ntheir heads borne down by the weight of the grains, and bending down\r\nwith the fruit, which was now ripe and fit for reaping; and near these I\r\nsaw seven other ears of corn, meager and weak, for want of rain, which\r\nfell to eating and consuming those that were fit for reaping, and put me\r\ninto great astonishment.\"\r\n\r\n6. To which Joseph replied:—\"This dream,\" said he, \"O king, although\r\nseen under two forms, signifies one and the same event of things; for\r\nwhen thou sawest the fat kine, which is an animal made for the plough\r\nand for labor, devoured by the worser kine, and the ears of corn eaten\r\nup by the smaller ears, they foretell a famine, and want of the fruits\r\nof the earth for the same number of years, and equal with those when\r\nEgypt was in a happy state; and this so far, that the plenty of these\r\nyears will be spent in the same number of years of scarcity, and that\r\nscarcity of necessary provisions will be very difficult to be corrected;\r\nas a sign whereof, the ill-favored kine, when they had devoured the\r\nbetter sort, could not be satisfied. But still God foreshows what is to\r\ncome upon men, not to grieve them, but that, when they know it\r\nbeforehand, they may by prudence make the actual experience of what is\r\nforetold the more tolerable. If thou, therefore, carefully dispose of\r\nthe plentiful crops which will come in the former years, thou wilt\r\nprocure that the future calamity will not be felt by the Egyptians.\"\r\n\r\n7. Hereupon the king wondered at the discretion and wisdom of Joseph;\r\nand asked him by what means he might so dispense the foregoing plentiful\r\ncrops in the happy years, as to make the miserable crops more tolerable.\r\nJoseph then added this his advice: To spare the good crops, and not\r\npermit the Egyptians to spend them luxuriously, but to reserve what they\r\nwould have spent in luxury beyond their necessity against the time of\r\nwant. He also exhorted him to take the corn of the husbandmen, and give\r\nthem only so much as will be sufficient for their food. Accordingly\r\nPharaoh being surprised at Joseph, not only for his interpretation of\r\nthe dream, but for the counsel he had given him, intrusted him with\r\ndispensing the corn; with power to do what he thought would be for the\r\nbenefit of the people of Egypt, and for the benefit of the king, as\r\nbelieving that he who first discovered this method of acting, would\r\nprove the best overseer of it. But Joseph having this power given him by\r\nthe king, with leave to make use of his seal, and to wear purple, drove\r\nin his chariot through all the land of Egypt, and took the corn of the\r\nhusbandmen, 3 allotting as much to every one as would be sufficient for\r\nseed, and for food, but without discovering to any one the reason why he\r\ndid so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How Joseph When He Was Become Famous In Egypt, Had His\r\nBrethren In Subjection.\r\n\r\n1. Joseph was now grown up to thirty years of age, and enjoyed great\r\nhonors from the king, who called him Psothom Phanech, out of regard to\r\nhis prodigious degree of wisdom; for that name denotes the revealer of\r\nsecrets. He also married a wife of very high quality; for he married the\r\ndaughter of Petephres, 4 one of the priests of Heliopolis; she was a\r\nvirgin, and her name was Asenath. By her he had children before the\r\nscarcity came on; Manasseh, the elder, which signifies forgetful,\r\nbecause his present happiness made him forget his former misfortunes;\r\nand Ephraim, the younger, which signifies restored, because he was\r\nrestored to the freedom of his forefathers. Now after Egypt had happily\r\npassed over seven years, according to Joseph's interpretation of the\r\ndreams, the famine came upon them in the eighth year; and because this\r\nmisfortune fell upon them when they had no sense of it beforehand, 5\r\nthey were all sorely afflicted by it, and came running to the king's\r\ngates; and he called upon Joseph, who sold the corn to them, being\r\nbecome confessedly a savior to the whole multitude of the Egyptians. Nor\r\ndid he open this market of corn for the people of that country only, but\r\nstrangers had liberty to buy also; Joseph being willing that all men,\r\nwho are naturally akin to one another, should have assistance from those\r\nthat lived in happiness.\r\n\r\n2. Now Jacob also, when he understood that foreigners might come, sent\r\nall his sons into Egypt to buy corn, for the land of Canaan was\r\ngrievously afflicted with the famine; and this great misery touched the\r\nwhole continent. He only retained Benjamin, who was born to him by\r\nRachel, and was of the same mother with Joseph. These sons of Jacob then\r\ncame into Egypt, and applied themselves to Joseph, wanting to buy corn;\r\nfor nothing of this kind was done without his approbation, since even\r\nthen only was the honor that was paid the king himself advantageous to\r\nthe persons that paid it, when they took care to honor Joseph also. Now\r\nwhen he well knew his brethren, they thought nothing of him; for he was\r\nbut a youth when he left them, and was now come to an age so much\r\ngreater, that the lineaments of his face were changed, and he was not\r\nknown by them: besides this, the greatness of the dignity wherein he\r\nappeared, suffered them not so much as to suspect it was he. He now made\r\ntrial what sentiments they had about affairs of the greatest\r\nconsequence; for he refused to sell them corn, and said they were come\r\nas spies of the king's affairs; and that they came from several\r\ncountries, and joined themselves together, and pretended that they were\r\nof kin, it not being possible that a private man should breed up so many\r\nsons, and those of so great beauty of countenance as they were, such an\r\neducation of so many children being not easily obtained by kings\r\nthemselves. Now this he did in order to discover what concerned his\r\nfather, and what happened to him after his own departure from him, and\r\nas desiring to know what was become of Benjamin his brother; for he was\r\nafraid that they had ventured on the like wicked enterprise against him\r\nthat they had done to himself, and had taken him off also.\r\n\r\n3. Now these brethren of his were under distraction and terror, and\r\nthought that very great danger hung over them; yet not at all reflecting\r\nupon their brother Joseph, and standing firm under the accusations laid\r\nagainst them, they made their defense by Reubel, the eldest of them, who\r\nnow became their spokesman: \"We come not hither,\" said he, \"with any\r\nunjust design, nor in order to bring any harm to the king's affairs; we\r\nonly want to be preserved, as supposing your humanity might be a refuge\r\nfor us from the miseries which our country labors under, we having heard\r\nthat you proposed to sell corn, not only to your own countrymen, but to\r\nstrangers also, and that you determined to allow that corn, in order to\r\npreserve all that want it; but that we are brethren, and of the same\r\ncommon blood, the peculiar lineaments of our faces, and those not so\r\nmuch different from one another, plainly show. Our father's name is\r\nJacob, an Hebrew man, who had twelve of us for his sons by four wives;\r\nwhich twelve of us, while we were all alive, were a happy family; but\r\nwhen one of our brethren, whose name was Joseph, died, our affairs\r\nchanged for the worse, for our father could not forbear to make a long\r\nlamentation for him; and we are in affliction, both by the calamity of\r\nthe death of our brother, and the miserable state of our aged father. We\r\nare now, therefore, come to buy corn, having intrusted the care of our\r\nfather, and the provision for our family, to Benjamin, our youngest\r\nbrother; and if thou sendest to our house, thou mayst learn whether we\r\nare guilty of the least falsehood in what we say.\"\r\n\r\n4. And thus did Reubel endeavor to persuade Joseph to have a better\r\nopinion of them. But when he had learned from them that Jacob was alive,\r\nand that his brother was not destroyed by them, he for the present put\r\nthem in prison, as intending to examine more into their affairs when he\r\nshould be at leisure. But on the third day he brought them out, and said\r\nto them, \"Since you constantly affirm that you are not come to do any\r\nharm to the king's affairs; that you are brethren, and the sons of the\r\nfather whom you named; you will satisfy me of the truth of what you say,\r\nif you leave one of your company with me, who shall suffer no injury\r\nhere; and if, when ye have carried corn to your father, you will come to\r\nme again, and bring your brother, whom you say you left there, along\r\nwith you, for this shall be by me esteemed an assurance of the truth of\r\nwhat you have told me.\" Hereupon they were in greater grief than before;\r\nthey wept, and perpetually deplored one among another the calamity of\r\nJoseph; and said, \"They were fallen into this misery as a punishment\r\ninflicted by God for what evil contrivances they had against him.\" And\r\nReubel was large in his reproaches of them for their too late\r\nrepentance, whence no profit arose to Joseph; and earnestly exhorted\r\nthem to bear with patience whatever they suffered, since it was done by\r\nGod in way of punishment, on his account. Thus they spake to one\r\nanother, not imagining that Joseph understood their language. A general\r\nsadness also seized on them at Reubel's words, and a repentance for what\r\nthey had done; and they condemned the wickedness they had perpetrated,\r\nfor which they judged they were justly punished by God. Now when Joseph\r\nsaw that they were in this distress, he was so affected at it that he\r\nfell into tears, and not being willing that they should take notice of\r\nhim, he retired; and after a while came to them again, and taking Symeon\r\n6 in order to his being a pledge for his brethren's return, he bid them\r\ntake the corn they had bought, and go their way. He also commanded his\r\nsteward privily to put the money which they had brought with them for\r\nthe purchase of corn into their sacks, and to dismiss them therewith;\r\nwho did what he was commanded to do.\r\n\r\n5. Now when Jacob's sons were come into the land of Canaan, they told\r\ntheir father what had happened to them in Egypt, and that they were\r\ntaken to have come thither as spies upon the king; and how they said\r\nthey were brethren, and had left their eleventh brother with their\r\nfather, but were not believed; and how they had left Symeon with the\r\ngovernor, until Benjamin should go thither, and be a testimonial of the\r\ntruth of what they had said: and they begged of their father to fear\r\nnothing, but to send the lad along with them. But Jacob was not pleased\r\nwith any thing his sons had done; and he took the detention of Symeon\r\nheinously, and thence thought it a foolish thing to give up Benjamin\r\nalso. Neither did he yield to Reubel's persuasion, though he begged it\r\nof him, and gave leave that the grandfather might, in way of requital,\r\nkill his own sons, in case any harm came to Benjamin in the journey. So\r\nthey were distressed, and knew not what to do; nay, there was another\r\naccident that still disturbed them more,—the money that was found hidden\r\nin their sacks of corn. Yet when the corn they had brought failed them,\r\nand when the famine still afflicted them, and necessity forced them,\r\nJacob did 7 [not] still resolve to send Benjamin with his brethren,\r\nalthough there was no returning into Egypt unless they came with what\r\nthey had promised. Now the misery growing every day worse, and his sons\r\nbegging it of him, he had no other course to take in his present\r\ncircumstances. And Judas, who was of a bold temper on other occasions,\r\nspake his mind very freely to him: \"That it did not become him to be\r\nafraid on account of his son, nor to suspect the worst, as he did; for\r\nnothing could be done to his son but by the appointment of God, which\r\nmust also for certain come to pass, though he were at home with him;\r\nthat he ought not to condemn them to such manifest destruction; nor\r\ndeprive them of that plenty of food they might have from Pharaoh, by his\r\nunreasonable fear about his son Benjamin, but ought to take care of the\r\npreservation of Symeon, lest, by attempting to hinder Benjamin's\r\njourney, Symeon should perish. He exhorted him to trust God for him; and\r\nsaid he would either bring his son back to him safe, or, together with\r\nhis, lose his own life.\" So that Jacob was at length persuaded, and\r\ndelivered Benjamin to them, with the price of the corn doubled; he also\r\nsent presents to Joseph of the fruits of the land of Canaan, balsam and\r\nrosin, as also turpentine and honey. 8 Now their father shed many tears\r\nat the departure of his sons, as well as themselves. His concern was,\r\nthat he might receive them back again safe after their journey; and\r\ntheir concern was, that they might find their father well, and no way\r\nafflicted with grief for them. And this lamentation lasted a whole day;\r\nso that the old man was at last tired with grief, and staid behind; but\r\nthey went on their way for Egypt, endeavoring to mitigate their grief\r\nfor their present misfortunes, with the hopes of better success\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n6. As soon as they came into Egypt, they were brought down to Joseph:\r\nbut here no small fear disturbed them, lest they should be accused about\r\nthe price of the corn, as if they had cheated Joseph. They then made a\r\nlong apology to Joseph's steward; and told him, that when they came home\r\nthey found the money in their sacks, and that they had now brought it\r\nalong with them. He said he did not know what they meant: so they were\r\ndelivered from that fear. And when he had loosed Symeon, and put him\r\ninto a handsome habit, he suffered him to be with his brethren; at which\r\ntime Joseph came from his attendance on the king. So they offered him\r\ntheir presents; and upon his putting the question to them about their\r\nfather, they answered that they found him well. He also, upon his\r\ndiscovery that Benjamin was alive, asked whether this was their younger\r\nbrother; for he had seen him. Whereupon they said he was: he replied,\r\nthat the God over all was his protector. But when his affection to him\r\nmade him shed tears, he retired, desiring he might not be seen in that\r\nplight by his brethren. Then Joseph took them to supper, and they were\r\nset down in the same order as they used to sit at their father's table.\r\nAnd although Joseph treated them all kindly, yet did he send a mess to\r\nBenjamin that was double to what the rest of the guests had for their\r\nshares.\r\n\r\n7. Now when after supper they had composed themselves to sleep, Joseph\r\ncommanded his steward both to give them their measures of corn, and to\r\nhide its price again in their sacks; and that withal they should put\r\ninto Benjamin's sack the golden cup, out of which he loved himself to\r\ndrink.—which things he did, in order to make trial of his brethren,\r\nwhether they would stand by Benjamin when he should be accused of having\r\nstolen the cup, and should appear to be in danger; or whether they would\r\nleave him, and, depending on their own innocency, go to their father\r\nwithout him. When the servant had done as he was bidden, the sons of\r\nJacob, knowing nothing of all this, went their way, and took Symeon\r\nalong with them, and had a double cause of joy, both because they had\r\nreceived him again, and because they took back Benjamin to their father,\r\nas they had promised. But presently a troop of horsemen encompassed\r\nthem, and brought with them Joseph's servant, who had put the cup into\r\nBenjamin's sack. Upon which unexpected attack of the horsemen they were\r\nmuch disturbed, and asked what the reason was that they came thus upon\r\nmen, who a little before had been by their lord thought worthy of an\r\nhonorable and hospitable reception? They replied, by calling them wicked\r\nwretches, who had forgot that very hospitable and kind treatment which\r\nJoseph had given them, and did not scruple to be injurious to him, and\r\nto carry off that cup out of which he had, in so friendly a manner,\r\ndrank to them, and not regarding their friendship with Joseph, no more\r\nthan the danger they should be in if they were taken, in comparison of\r\nthe unjust gain. Hereupon he threatened that they should be punished;\r\nfor though they had escaped the knowledge of him who was but a servant,\r\nyet had they not escaped the knowledge of God, nor had gone off with\r\nwhat they had stolen; and, after all, asked why we come upon them, as if\r\nthey knew nothing of the matter: and he told them that they should\r\nimmediately know it by their punishment. This, and more of the same\r\nnature, did the servant say, in way of reproach to them: but they being\r\nwholly ignorant of any thing here that concerned them, laughed at what\r\nhe said, and wondered at the abusive language which the servant gave\r\nthem, when he was so hardy as to accuse those who did not before so much\r\nas retain the price of their corn, which was found in their sacks, but\r\nbrought it again, though nobody else knew of any such thing,—so far were\r\nthey from offering any injury to Joseph voluntarily. But still,\r\nsupposing that a search would be a more sure justification of themselves\r\nthan their own denial of the fact, they bid him search them, and that if\r\nany of them had been guilty of the theft, to punish them all; for being\r\nno way conscious to themselves of any crime, they spake with assurance,\r\nand, as they thought, without any danger to themselves also. The\r\nservants desired there might be a search made; but they said the\r\npunishment should extend to him alone who should be found guilty of the\r\ntheft. So they made the search; and, having searched all the rest, they\r\ncame last of all to Benjamin, as knowing it was Benjamin's sack in which\r\nthey had hidden the cup, they having indeed searched the rest only for a\r\nshow of accuracy: so the rest were out of fear for themselves, and were\r\nnow only concerned about Benjamin, but still were well assured that he\r\nwould also be found innocent; and they reproached those that came after\r\nthem for their hindering them, while they might, in the mean while, have\r\ngotten a good way on their journey. But as soon as they had searched\r\nBenjamin's sack, they found the cup, and took it from him; and all was\r\nchanged into mourning and lamentation. They rent their garments, and\r\nwept for the punishment which their brother was to undergo for his\r\ntheft, and for the delusion they had put on their father, when they\r\npromised they would bring Benjamin safe to him. What added to their\r\nmisery was, that this melancholy accident came unfortunately at a time\r\nwhen they thought they had been gotten off clear; but they confessed\r\nthat this misfortune of their brother, as well as the grief of their\r\nfather for him, was owing to themselves, since it was they that forced\r\ntheir father to send him with them, when he was averse to it.\r\n\r\n8. The horsemen therefore took Benjamin and brought him to Joseph, his\r\nbrethren also following him; who, when he saw him in custody, and them\r\nin the habit of mourners, said, \"How came you, vile wretches as you are,\r\nto have such a strange notion of my kindness to you, and of God's\r\nprovidence, as impudently to do thus to your benefactor, who in such an\r\nhospitable manner had entertained you?\" Whereupon they gave up\r\nthemselves to be punished, in order to save Benjamin; and called to mind\r\nwhat a wicked enterprise they had been guilty of against Joseph. They\r\nalso pronounced him more happy than themselves, if he were dead, in\r\nbeing freed from the miseries of this life; and if he were alive, that\r\nhe enjoyed the pleasure of seeing God's vengeance upon them. They said\r\nfurther; that they were the plague of their father, since they should\r\nnow add to his former affliction for Joseph, this other affliction for\r\nBenjamin. Reubel also was large in cutting them upon this occasion. But\r\nJoseph dismissed them; for he said they had been guilty of no offense,\r\nand that he would content himself with the lad's punishment; for he said\r\nit was not a fit thing to let him go free, for the sake of those who had\r\nnot offended; nor was it a fit thing to punish them together with him\r\nwho had been guilty of stealing. And when he promised to give them leave\r\nto go away in safety, the rest of them were under great consternation,\r\nand were able to say nothing on this sad occasion. But Judas, who had\r\npersuaded their father to send the lad from him, being otherwise also a\r\nvery bold and active man, determined to hazard himself for the\r\npreservation of his brother. \"It is true,\" 9 said he, \"O governor, that\r\nwe have been very wicked with regard to thee, and on that account\r\ndeserved punishment; even all of us may justly be punished, although the\r\ntheft were not committed by all, but only by one of us, and he the\r\nyoungest also; but yet there remains some hope for us, who otherwise\r\nmust be under despair on his account, and this from thy goodness, which\r\npromises us a deliverance out of our present danger. And now I beg thou\r\nwilt not look at us, or at that great crime we have been guilty of, but\r\nat thy own excellent nature, and take advice of thine own virtue,\r\ninstead of that wrath thou hast against us; which passion those that\r\notherwise are of lower character indulge, as they do their strength, and\r\nthat not only on great, but also on very trifling occasions. Overcome,\r\nsir, that passion, and be not subdued by it, nor suffer it to slay those\r\nthat do not otherwise presume upon their own safety, but are desirous to\r\naccept of it from thee; for this is not the first time that thou wilt\r\nbestow it on us, but before, when we came to buy corn, thou affordedst\r\nus great plenty of food, and gavest us leave to carry so much home to\r\nour family as has preserved them from perishing by famine. Nor is there\r\nany difference between not overlooking men that were perishing for want\r\nof necessaries, and not punishing those that seem to be offenders, and\r\nhave been so unfortunate as to lose the advantage of that glorious\r\nbenefaction which they received from thee. This will be an instance of\r\nequal favor, though bestowed after a different manner; for thou wilt\r\nsave those this way whom thou didst feed the other; and thou wilt hereby\r\npreserve alive, by thy own bounty, those souls which thou didst not\r\nsuffer to be distressed by famine, it being indeed at once a wonderful\r\nand a great thing to sustain our lives by corn, and to bestow on us that\r\npardon, whereby, now we are distressed, we may continue those lives. And\r\nI am ready to suppose that God is willing to afford thee this\r\nopportunity of showing thy virtuous disposition, by bringing us into\r\nthis calamity, that it may appear thou canst forgive the injuries that\r\nare done to thyself, and mayst be esteemed kind to others, besides those\r\nwho, on other accounts, stand in need of thy assistance; since it is\r\nindeed a right thing to do well to those who are in distress for want of\r\nfood, but still a more glorious thing to save those who deserve to be\r\npunished, when it is on account of heinous offenses against thyself; for\r\nif it be a thing deserving commendation to forgive such as have been\r\nguilty of small offenses, that tend to a person's loss, and this be\r\npraiseworthy in him that overlooks such offenses, to restrain a man's\r\npassion as to crimes which are capital to the guilty, is to be like the\r\nmost excellent nature of God himself. And truly, as for myself, had it\r\nnot been that we had a father, who had discovered, on occasion of the\r\ndeath of Joseph, how miserably he is always afflicted at the loss of his\r\nsons, I had not made any words on account of the saving of our own\r\nlives; I mean, any further than as that would be an excellent character\r\nfor thyself, to preserve even those that would have nobody to lament\r\nthem when they were dead, but we would have yielded ourselves up to\r\nsuffer whatsoever thou pleasedst; but now [for we do not plead for mercy\r\nto ourselves, though indeed, if we die, it will be while we are young,\r\nand before we have had the enjoyment of life] have regard to our father,\r\nand take pity of his old age, on whose account it is that we make these\r\nsupplications to thee. We beg thou wilt give us those lives which this\r\nwickedness of ours has rendered obnoxious to thy punishment; and this\r\nfor his sake who is not himself wicked, nor does his being our father\r\nmake us wicked. He is a good man, and not worthy to have such trials of\r\nhis patience; and now, we are absent, he is afflicted with care for us.\r\nBut if he hear of our deaths, and what was the cause of it, he will on\r\nthat account die an immature death; and the reproachful manner of our\r\nruin will hasten his end, and will directly kill him; nay, will bring\r\nhim to a miserable death, while he will make haste to rid himself out of\r\nthe world, and bring himself to a state of insensibility, before the sad\r\nstory of our end come abroad into the rest of the world. Consider these\r\nthings in this manner, although our wickedness does now provoke thee\r\nwith a just desire of punishing that wickedness, and forgive it for our\r\nfather's sake; and let thy commiseration of him weigh more with thee\r\nthan our wickedness. Have regard to the old age of our father, who, if\r\nwe perish, will be very lonely while he lives, and will soon die himself\r\nalso. 10 Grant this boon to the name of fathers, for thereby thou wilt\r\nhonor him that begat thee, and will grant it to thyself also, who\r\nenjoyest already that denomination; thou wilt then, by that\r\ndenomination, be preserved of God, the Father of all,—by showing a pious\r\nregard to which, in the case of our father, thou wilt appear to honor\r\nhim who is styled by the same name; I mean, if thou wilt have this pity\r\non our father, upon this consideration, how miserable he will be if he\r\nbe deprived of his sons! It is thy part therefore to bestow on us what\r\nGod has given us, when it is in thy power to take it away, and so to\r\nresemble him entirely in charity; for it is good to use that power,\r\nwhich can either give or take away, on the merciful side; and when it is\r\nin thy power to destroy, to forget that thou ever hadst that power, and\r\nto look on thyself as only allowed power for preservation; and that the\r\nmore any one extends this power, the greater reputation does he gain to\r\nhimself. Now, by forgiving our brother what he has unhappily committed,\r\nthou wilt preserve us all; for we cannot think of living if he be put to\r\ndeath, since we dare not show ourselves alive to our father without our\r\nbrother, but here must we partake of one and the same catastrophe of his\r\nlife. And so far we beg of thee, O governor, that if thou condemnest our\r\nbrother to die, thou wilt punish us together with him, as partners of\r\nhis crime,—for we shall not think it reasonable to be reserved to kill\r\nourselves for grief of our brother's death, but so to die rather as\r\nequally guilty with him of this crime. I will only leave with thee this\r\none consideration, and then will say no more, viz. that our brother\r\ncommitted this fault when he was young, and not yet of confirmed wisdom\r\nin his conduct; and that men naturally forgive such young persons. I end\r\nhere, without adding what more I have to say, that in case thou\r\ncondemnest us, that omission may be supposed to have hurt us, and\r\npermitted thee to take the severer side. But in case thou settest us\r\nfree, that this may be ascribed to thy own goodness, of which thou art\r\ninwardly conscious, that thou freest us from condemnation; and that not\r\nby barely preserving us, but by granting us such a favor as will make us\r\nappear more righteous than we really are, and by representing to thyself\r\nmore motives for our deliverance than we are able to produce ourselves.\r\nIf, therefore, thou resolvest to slay him, I desire thou wilt slay me in\r\nhis stead, and send him back to his father; or if thou pleasest to\r\nretain him with thee as a slave, I am fitter to labor for thy advantage\r\nin that capacity, and, as thou seest, am better prepared for either of\r\nthose sufferings.\" So Judas, being very willing to undergo any thing\r\nwhatever for the deliverance of his brother, cast himself down at\r\nJoseph's feet, and earnestly labored to assuage and pacify his anger.\r\nAll his brethren also fell down before him, weeping and delivering\r\nthemselves up to destruction for the preservation of the life of\r\nBenjamin.\r\n\r\n10. But Joseph, as overcome now with his affections, and no longer able\r\nto personate an angry man, commanded all that were present to depart,\r\nthat he might make himself known to his brethren when they were alone;\r\nand when the rest were gone out, he made himself known to his brethren;\r\nand said, \"I commend you for your virtue, and your kindness to our\r\nbrother: I find you better men than I could have expected from what you\r\ncontrived about me. Indeed, I did all this to try your love to your\r\nbrother; so I believe you were not wicked by nature in what you did in\r\nmy case, but that all has happened according to God's will, who has\r\nhereby procured our enjoyment of what good things we have; and, if he\r\ncontinue in a favorable disposition, of what we hope for hereafter.\r\nSince, therefore, I know that our father is safe and well, beyond\r\nexpectation, and I see you so well disposed to your brother, I will no\r\nlonger remember what guilt you seem to have had about me, but will leave\r\noff to hate you for that your wickedness; and do rather return you my\r\nthanks, that you have concurred with the intentions of God to bring\r\nthings to their present state. I would have you also rather to forget\r\nthe same, since that imprudence of yours is come to such a happy\r\nconclusion, than to be uneasy and blush at those your offenses. Do not,\r\ntherefore, let your evil intentions, when you condemned me, and that\r\nbitter remorse which might follow, be a grief to you now, because those\r\nintentions were frustrated. Go, therefore, your way, rejoicing in what\r\nhas happened by the Divine Providence, and inform your father of it,\r\nlest he should be spent with cares for you, and deprive me of the most\r\nagreeable part of my felicity; I mean, lest he should die before he\r\ncomes into my sight, and enjoys the good things that we now have. Bring,\r\ntherefore, with you our father, and your wives and children, and all\r\nyour kindred, and remove your habitations hither; for it is not proper\r\nthat the persons dearest to me should live remote from me, now my\r\naffairs are so prosperous, especially when they must endure five more\r\nyears of famine.\" When Joseph had said this, he embraced his brethren,\r\nwho were in tears and sorrow; but the generous kindness of their brother\r\nseemed to leave among them no room for fear, lest they should be\r\npunished on account of what they had consulted and acted against him;\r\nand they were then feasting. Now the king, as soon as he heard that\r\nJoseph's brethren were come to him, was exceeding glad of it, as if it\r\nhad been a part of his own good fortune; and gave them wagons full of\r\ncorn and gold and silver, to be conveyed to his father. Now when they\r\nhad received more of their brother part to be carried to their father,\r\nand part as free gifts to every one of themselves, Benjamin having still\r\nmore than the rest, they departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. The Removal Of Joseph's Father With All His Family, To Him,\r\nOn Account Of The Famine.\r\n\r\n1. As soon as Jacob came to know, by his sons returning home, in what\r\nstate Joseph was, that he had not only escaped death, for which yet he\r\nlived all along in mourning, but that he lived in splendor and\r\nhappiness, and ruled over Egypt, jointly with the king, and had\r\nintrusted to his care almost all his affairs, he did not think any thing\r\nhe was told to be incredible, considering the greatness of the works of\r\nGod, and his kindness to him, although that kindness had, for some late\r\ntimes, been intermitted; so he immediately and zealously set out upon\r\nhis journey to him.\r\n\r\n2. When he came to the Well of the Oath, [Beersheba,] he offered\r\nsacrifice to God; and being afraid that the happiness there was in Egypt\r\nmight tempt his posterity to fall in love with it, and settle in it, and\r\nno more think of removing into the land of Canaan, and possessing it, as\r\nGod had promised them; as also being afraid, lest, if this descent into\r\nEgypt were made without the will of God, his family might be destroyed\r\nthere; out of fear, withal, lest he should depart this life before he\r\ncame to the sight of Joseph; he fell asleep, revolving these doubts in\r\nhis mind.\r\n\r\n3. But God stood by him, and called him twice by his name; and when he\r\nasked who he was, God said, \"No, sure; it is not just that thou, Jacob,\r\nshouldst be unacquainted with that God who has been ever a protector and\r\na helper to thy forefathers, and after them to thyself: for when thy\r\nfather would have deprived thee of the dominion, I gave it thee; and by\r\nmy kindness it was that, when thou wast sent into Mesopotamia all alone,\r\nthou obtainedst good wives, and returnedst with many children, and much\r\nwealth. Thy whole family also has been preserved by my providence; and\r\nit was I who conducted Joseph, thy son, whom thou gavest up for lost, to\r\nthe enjoyment of great prosperity. I also made him lord of Egypt, so\r\nthat he differs but little from a king. Accordingly, I come now as a\r\nguide to thee in this journey; and foretell to thee, that thou shalt die\r\nin the arms of Joseph: and I inform thee, that thy posterity shall be\r\nmany ages in authority and glory, and that I will settle them in the\r\nland which I have promised them.\"\r\n\r\n4. Jacob, encouraged by this dream, went on more cheerfully for Egypt\r\nwith his sons, and all belonging to them. Now they were in all seventy.\r\nI once, indeed, thought it best not to set down the names of this\r\nfamily, especially because of their difficult pronunciation [by the\r\nGreeks]; but, upon the whole, I think it necessary to mention those\r\nnames, that I may disprove such as believe that we came not originally\r\nfrom Mesopotamia, but are Egyptians. Now Jacob had twelve sons; of these\r\nJoseph was come thither before. We will therefore set down the names of\r\nJacob's children and grandchildren. Reuben had four sons--Anoch, Phallu,\r\nAssaron, Charmi. Simeon had six--Jamuel, Jamin, Avod, Jachin, Soar,\r\nSaul. Levi had three sons--Gersom, Caath, Merari. Judas had three sons--\r\nSala, Phares, Zerah; and by Phares two grandchildren, Esrom and Amar.\r\nIssachar had four sons--Thola, Phua, Jasob, Samaron. Zabulon had with\r\nhim three sons--Sarad, Helon, Jalel. So far is the posterity of Lea;\r\nwith whom went her daughter Dinah. These are thirty-three. Rachel had\r\ntwo sons, the one of whom, Joseph, had two sons also, Manasses and\r\nEphraim. The other, Benjamin, had ten sons—Bolau, Bacchar, Asabel,\r\nGeras, Naaman, Jes, Ros, Momphis, Opphis, Arad. These fourteen added to\r\nthe thirty-three before enumerated, amount to the number forty-seven.\r\nAnd this was the legitimate posterity of Jacob. He had besides by\r\nBilhah, the handmaid of Rachel, Dan and Nephtliali; which last had four\r\nsons that followed him— Jesel, Guni, Issari, and Sellim. Dan had an only\r\nbegotten son, Usi. If these be added to those before mentioned, they\r\ncomplete the number fifty-four. Gad and Aser were the sons of Zilpha,\r\nwho was the handmaid of Lea. These had with them, Gad seven— Saphoniah,\r\nAugis, Sunis, Azabon, Aerin, Erocd, Ariel. Aser had a daughter, Sarah,\r\nand six male children, whose names were Jomne, Isus, Isoui, Baris, Abar\r\nand Melchiel. If we add these, which are sixteen, to the fifty-four, the\r\nforementioned number 70 is completed 11 Jacob not being himself included\r\nin that number.\r\n\r\n5. When Joseph understood that his father was coming, for Judas his\r\nbrother was come before him, and informed him of his approach, he went\r\nout to meet him; and they met together at Heroopolis. But Jacob almost\r\nfainted away at this unexpected and great joy; however, Joseph revived\r\nhim, being yet not himself able to contain from being affected in the\r\nsame manner, at the pleasure he now had; yet was he not wholly overcome\r\nwith his passion, as his father was. After this, he desired Jacob to\r\ntravel on slowly; but he himself took five of his brethren with him, and\r\nmade haste to the king, to tell him that Jacob and his family were come;\r\nwhich was a joyful hearing to him. He also bid Joseph tell him what sort\r\nof life his brethren loved to lead, that he might give them leave to\r\nfollow the same, who told him they were good shepherds, and had been\r\nused to follow no other employment but this alone. Whereby he provided\r\nfor them, that they should not be separated, but live in the same place,\r\nand take care of their father; as also hereby he provided, that they\r\nmight be acceptable to the Egyptians, by doing nothing that would be\r\ncommon to them with the Egyptians; for the Egyptians are prohibited to\r\nmeddle with feeding of sheep. 12\r\n\r\n6. When Jacob was come to the king, and saluted him, and wished all\r\nprosperity to his government, Pharaoh asked him how old he now was; upon\r\nwhose answer, that he was a hundred and thirty years old, he admired\r\nJacob on account of the length of his life. And when he had added, that\r\nstill he had not lived so long as his forefathers, he gave him leave to\r\nlive with his children in Heliopolis; for in that city the king's\r\nshepherds had their pasturage.\r\n\r\n7. However, the famine increased among the Egyptians, and this heavy\r\njudgment grew more oppressive to them, because neither did the river\r\noverflow the ground, for it did not rise to its former height, nor did\r\nGod send rain upon it; 13 nor did they indeed make the least provision\r\nfor themselves, so ignorant were they what was to be done; but Joseph\r\nsold them corn for their money. But when their money failed them, they\r\nbought corn with their cattle and their slaves; and if any of them had a\r\nsmall piece of land, they gave up that to purchase them food, by which\r\nmeans the king became the owner of all their substance; and they were\r\nremoved, some to one place, and some to another, that so the possession\r\nof their country might be firmly assured to the king, excepting the\r\nlands of the priests, for their country continued still in their own\r\npossession. And indeed this sore famine made their minds, as well as\r\ntheir bodies, slaves; and at length compelled them to procure a\r\nsufficiency of food by such dishonorable means. But when this misery\r\nceased, and the river overflowed the ground, and the ground brought\r\nforth its fruits plentifully, Joseph came to every city, and gathered\r\nthe people thereto belonging together, and gave them back entirely the\r\nland which, by their own consent, the king might have possessed alone,\r\nand alone enjoyed the fruits of it. He also exhorted them to look on it\r\nas every one's own possession, and to fall to their husbandry with\r\ncheerfulness, and to pay as a tribute to the king, the fifth part 14 of\r\nthe fruits for the land which the king, when it was his own, restored to\r\nthem. These men rejoiced upon their becoming unexpectedly owners of\r\ntheir lands, and diligently observed what was enjoined them; and by this\r\nmeans Joseph procured to himself a greater authority among the\r\nEgyptians, and greater love to the king from them. Now this law, that\r\nthey should pay the fifth part of their fruits as tribute, continued\r\nuntil their later kings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. Of The Death Of Jacob And Joseph.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Jacob had lived seventeen years in Egypt, he fell into a\r\ndisease, and died in the presence of his sons; but not till he made his\r\nprayers for their enjoying prosperity, and till he had foretold to them\r\nprophetically how every one of them was to dwell in the land of Canaan.\r\nBut this happened many years afterward. He also enlarged upon the\r\npraises of Joseph 15 how he had not remembered the evil doings of his\r\nbrethren to their disadvantage; nay, on the contrary, was kind to them,\r\nbestowing upon them so many benefits, as seldom are bestowed on men's\r\nown benefactors. He then commanded his own sons that they should admit\r\nJoseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasses, into their number, and divide the\r\nland of Canaan in common with them; concerning whom we shall treat\r\nhereafter. However, he made it his request that he might be buried at\r\nHebron. So he died, when he had lived full a hundred and fifty years,\r\nthree only abated, having not been behind any of his ancestors in piety\r\ntowards God, and having such a recompense for it, as it was fit those\r\nshould have who were so good as these were. But Joseph, by the king's\r\npermission, carried his father's dead body to Hebron, and there buried\r\nit, at a great expense. Now his brethren were at first unwilling to\r\nreturn back with him, because they were afraid lest, now their father\r\nwas dead, he should punish them for their secret practices against him;\r\nsince he was now gone, for whose sake he had been so gracious to them.\r\nBut he persuaded them to fear no harm, and to entertain no suspicions of\r\nhim: so he brought them along with him, and gave them great possessions,\r\nand never left off his particular concern for them.\r\n\r\n2. Joseph also died when he had lived a hundred and ten years; having\r\nbeen a man of admirable virtue, and conducting all his affairs by the\r\nrules of reason; and used his authority with moderation, which was the\r\ncause of his so great felicity among the Egyptians, even when he came\r\nfrom another country, and that in such ill circumstances also, as we\r\nhave already described. At length his brethren died, after they had\r\nlived happily in Egypt. Now the posterity and sons of these men, after\r\nsome time, carried their bodies, and buried them at Hebron: but as to\r\nthe bones of Joseph, they carried them into the land of Canaan\r\nafterward, when the Hebrews went out of Egypt, for so had Joseph made\r\nthem promise him upon oath. But what became of every one of these men,\r\nand by what toils they got the possession of the land of Canaan, shall\r\nbe shown hereafter, when I have first explained upon what account it was\r\nthat they left Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. Concerning The Afflictions That Befell The Hebrews In Egypt,\r\nDuring Four Hundred Years. 16\r\n\r\n1. Now it happened that the Egyptians grew delicate and lazy, as to\r\npains-taking, and gave themselves up to other pleasures, and in\r\nparticular to the love of gain. They also became very ill-affected\r\ntowards the Hebrews, as touched with envy at their prosperity; for when\r\nthey saw how the nation of the Israelites flourished, and were become\r\neminent already in plenty of wealth, which they had acquired by their\r\nvirtue and natural love of labor, they thought their increase was to\r\ntheir own detriment. And having, in length of time, forgotten the\r\nbenefits they had received from Joseph, particularly the crown being now\r\ncome into another family, they became very abusive to the Israelites,\r\nand contrived many ways of afflicting them; for they enjoined them to\r\ncut a great number of channels for the river, and to build walls for\r\ntheir cities and ramparts, that they might restrain the river, and\r\nhinder its waters from stagnating, upon its running over its own banks:\r\nthey set them also to build pyramids, 17 and by all this wore them out;\r\nand forced them to learn all sorts of mechanical arts, and to accustom\r\nthemselves to hard labor. And four hundred years did they spend under\r\nthese afflictions; for they strove one against the other which should\r\nget the mastery, the Egyptians desiring to destroy the Israelites by\r\nthese labors, and the Israelites desiring to hold out to the end under\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2. While the affairs of the Hebrews were in this condition, there was\r\nthis occasion offered itself to the Egyptians, which made them more\r\nsolicitous for the extinction of our nation. One of those sacred\r\nscribes, 18 who are very sagacious in foretelling future events truly,\r\ntold the king, that about this time there would a child be born to the\r\nIsraelites, who, if he were reared, would bring the Egyptian dominion\r\nlow, and would raise the Israelites; that he would excel all men in\r\nvirtue, and obtain a glory that would be remembered through all ages.\r\nWhich thing was so feared by the king, that, according to this man's\r\nopinion, he commanded that they should cast every male child, which was\r\nborn to the Israelites, into the river, and destroy it; that besides\r\nthis, the Egyptian midwives 19 should watch the labors of the Hebrew\r\nwomen, and observe what is born, for those were the women who were\r\nenjoined to do the office of midwives to them; and by reason of their\r\nrelation to the king, would not transgress his commands. He enjoined\r\nalso, that if any parents should disobey him, and venture to save their\r\nmale children alive, 20 they and their families should be destroyed.\r\nThis was a severe affliction indeed to those that suffered it, not only\r\nas they were deprived of their sons, and while they were the parents\r\nthemselves, they were obliged to be subservient to the destruction of\r\ntheir own children, but as it was to be supposed to tend to the\r\nextirpation of their nation, while upon the destruction of their\r\nchildren, and their own gradual dissolution, the calamity would become\r\nvery hard and inconsolable to them. And this was the ill state they were\r\nin. But no one can be too hard for the purpose of God, though he\r\ncontrive ten thousand subtle devices for that end; for this child, whom\r\nthe sacred scribe foretold, was brought up and concealed from the\r\nobservers appointed by the king; and he that foretold him did not\r\nmistake in the consequences of his preservation, which were brought to\r\npass after the manner following:—\r\n\r\n3. A man whose name was Amram, one of the nobler sort of the Hebrews,\r\nwas afraid for his whole nation, lest it should fail, by the want of\r\nyoung men to be brought up hereafter, and was very uneasy at it, his\r\nwife being then with child, and he knew not what to do. Hereupon he\r\nbetook himself to prayer to God; and entreated him to have compassion on\r\nthose men who had nowise transgressed the laws of his worship, and to\r\nafford them deliverance from the miseries they at that time endured, and\r\nto render abortive their enemies' hopes of the destruction of their\r\nnation. Accordingly God had mercy on him, and was moved by his\r\nsupplication. He stood by him in his sleep, and exhorted him not to\r\ndespair of his future favors. He said further, that he did not forget\r\ntheir piety towards him, and would always reward them for it, as he had\r\nformerly granted his favor to their forefathers, and made them increase\r\nfrom a few to so great a multitude. He put him in mind, that when\r\nAbraham was come alone out of Mesopotamia into Canaan, he had been made\r\nhappy, not only in other respects, but that when his wife was at first\r\nbarren, she was afterwards by him enabled to conceive seed, and bare him\r\nsons. That he left to Ismael and to his posterity the country of Arabia;\r\nas also to his sons by Ketura, Troglodytis; and to Isaac, Canaan. That\r\nby my assistance, said he, he did great exploits in war, which, unless\r\nyou be yourselves impious, you must still remember. As for Jacob, he\r\nbecame well known to strangers also, by the greatness of that prosperity\r\nin which he lived, and left to his sons, who came into Egypt with no\r\nmore than seventy souls, while you are now become above six hundred\r\nthousand. Know therefore that I shall provide for you all in common what\r\nis for your good, and particularly for thyself what shall make thee\r\nfamous; for that child, out of dread of whose nativity the Egyptians\r\nhave doomed the Israelite children to destruction, shall be this child\r\nof thine, and shall be concealed from those who watch to destroy him:\r\nand when he is brought up in a surprising way, he shall deliver the\r\nHebrew nation from the distress they are under from the Egyptians. His\r\nmemory shall be famous while the world lasts; and this not only among\r\nthe Hebrews, but foreigners also:—all which shall be the effect of my\r\nfavor to thee, and to thy posterity. He shall also have such a brother,\r\nthat he shall himself obtain my priesthood, and his posterity shall have\r\nit after him to the end of the world.\r\n\r\n4. When the vision had informed him of these things, Amram awaked and\r\ntold it to Jochebed who was his wife. And now the fear increased upon\r\nthem on account of the prediction in Amram's dream; for they were under\r\nconcern, not only for the child, but on account of the great happiness\r\nthat was to come to him also. However, the mother's labor was such as\r\nafforded a confirmation to what was foretold by God; for it was not\r\nknown to those that watched her, by the easiness of her pains, and\r\nbecause the throes of her delivery did not fall upon her with violence.\r\nAnd now they nourished the child at home privately for three months; but\r\nafter that time Amram, fearing he should be discovered, and, by falling\r\nunder the king's displeasure, both he and his child should perish, and\r\nso he should make the promise of God of none effect, he determined\r\nrather to trust the safety and care of the child to God, than to depend\r\non his own concealment of him, which he looked upon as a thing\r\nuncertain, and whereby both the child, so privately to be nourished, and\r\nhimself should be in imminent danger; but he believed that God would\r\nsome way for certain procure the safety of the child, in order to secure\r\nthe truth of his own predictions. When they had thus determined, they\r\nmade an ark of bulrushes, after the manner of a cradle, and of a bigness\r\nsufficient for an infant to be laid in, without being too straitened:\r\nthey then daubed it over with slime, which would naturally keep out the\r\nwater from entering between the bulrushes, and put the infant into it,\r\nand setting it afloat upon the river, they left its preservation to God;\r\nso the river received the child, and carried him along. But Miriam, the\r\nchild's sister, passed along upon the bank over against him, as her\r\nmother had bid her, to see whither the ark would be carried, where God\r\ndemonstrated that human wisdom was nothing, but that the Supreme Being\r\nis able to do whatsoever he pleases: that those who, in order to their\r\nown security, condemn others to destruction, and use great endeavors\r\nabout it, fail of their purpose; but that others are in a surprising\r\nmanner preserved, and obtain a prosperous condition almost from the very\r\nmidst of their calamities; those, I mean, whose dangers arise by the\r\nappointment of God. And, indeed, such a providence was exercised in the\r\ncase of this child, as showed the power of God.\r\n\r\n5. Thermuthis was the king's daughter. She was now diverting herself by\r\nthe banks of the river; and seeing a cradle borne along by the current,\r\nshe sent some that could swim, and bid them bring the cradle to her.\r\nWhen those that were sent on this errand came to her with the cradle,\r\nand she saw the little child, she was greatly in love with it, on\r\naccount of its largeness and beauty; for God had taken such great care\r\nin the formation of Moses, that he caused him to be thought worthy of\r\nbringing up, and providing for, by all those that had taken the most\r\nfatal resolutions, on account of the dread of his nativity, for the\r\ndestruction of the rest of the Hebrew nation. Thermuthis bid them bring\r\nher a woman that might afford her breast to the child; yet would not the\r\nchild admit of her breast, but turned away from it, and did the like to\r\nmany other women. Now Miriam was by when this happened, not to appear to\r\nbe there on purpose, but only as staying to see the child; and she said,\r\n\"It is in vain that thou, O queen, callest for these women for the\r\nnourishing of the child, who are no way of kin to it; but still, if thou\r\nwilt order one of the Hebrew women to be brought, perhaps it may admit\r\nthe breast of one of its own nation.\" Now since she seemed to speak\r\nwell, Thermuthis bid her procure such a one, and to bring one of those\r\nHebrew women that gave suck. So when she had such authority given her,\r\nshe came back and brought the mother, who was known to nobody there. And\r\nnow the child gladly admitted the breast, and seemed to stick close to\r\nit; and so it was, that, at the queen's desire, the nursing of the child\r\nwas entirely intrusted to the mother.\r\n\r\n6. Hereupon it was that Thermuthis imposed this name Mouses upon him,\r\nfrom what had happened when he was put into the river; for the Egyptians\r\ncall water by the name of Mo, and such as are saved out of it, by the\r\nname of Uses: so by putting these two words together, they imposed this\r\nname upon him. And he was, by the confession of all, according to God's\r\nprediction, as well for his greatness of mind as for his contempt of\r\ndifficulties, the best of all the Hebrews, for Abraham was his ancestor\r\nof the seventh generation. For Moses was the son of Amram, who was the\r\nson of Caath, whose father Levi was the son of Jacob, who was the son of\r\nIsaac, who was the son of Abraham. Now Moses's understanding became\r\nsuperior to his age, nay, far beyond that standard; and when he was\r\ntaught, he discovered greater quickness of apprehension than was usual\r\nat his age, and his actions at that time promised greater, when he\r\nshould come to the age of a man. God did also give him that tallness,\r\nwhen he was but three years old, as was wonderful. And as for his\r\nbeauty, there was nobody so unpolite as, when they saw Moses, they were\r\nnot greatly surprised at the beauty of his countenance; nay, it happened\r\nfrequently, that those that met him as he was carried along the road,\r\nwere obliged to turn again upon seeing the child; that they left what\r\nthey were about, and stood still a great while to look on him; for the\r\nbeauty of the child was so remarkable and natural to him on many\r\naccounts, that it detained the spectators, and made them stay longer to\r\nlook upon him.\r\n\r\n7. Thermuthis therefore perceiving him to be so remarkable a child,\r\nadopted him for her son, having no child of her own. And when one time\r\nhad carried Moses to her father, she showed him to him, and said she\r\nthought to make him her successor, if it should please God she should\r\nhave no legitimate child of her own; and to him, \"I have brought up a\r\nchild who is of a divine form, 21 and of a generous mind; and as I have\r\nreceived him from the bounty of the river, in, I thought proper to adopt\r\nhim my son, and the heir of thy kingdom.\" And she had said this, she put\r\nthe infant into her father's hands: so he took him, and hugged him to\r\nhis breast; and on his daughter's account, in a pleasant way, put his\r\ndiadem upon his head; but Moses threw it down to the ground, and, in a\r\npuerile mood, he wreathed it round, and trod upon his feet, which seemed\r\nto bring along with evil presage concerning the kingdom of Egypt. But\r\nwhen the sacred scribe saw this, [he was the person who foretold that\r\nhis nativity would lay the dominion of that kingdom low,] he made a\r\nviolent attempt to kill him; and crying out in a frightful manner, he\r\nsaid, \"This, O king! this child is he of whom God foretold, that if we\r\nkill him we shall be in no danger; he himself affords an attestation to\r\nthe prediction of the same thing, by his trampling upon thy government,\r\nand treading upon thy diadem. Take him, therefore, out of the way, and\r\ndeliver the Egyptians from the fear they are in about him; and deprive\r\nthe Hebrews of the hope they have of being encouraged by him.\" But\r\nThermuthis prevented him, and snatched the child away. And the king was\r\nnot hasty to slay him, God himself, whose providence protected Moses,\r\ninclining the king to spare him. He was, therefore, educated with great\r\ncare. So the Hebrews depended on him, and were of good hopes great\r\nthings would be done by him; but the Egyptians were suspicious of what\r\nwould follow such his education. Yet because, if Moses had been slain,\r\nthere was no one, either akin or adopted, that had any oracle on his\r\nside for pretending to the crown of Egypt, and likely to be of greater\r\nadvantage to them, they abstained from killing him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. How Moses Made War With The Ethiopians.\r\n\r\n1. Moses, therefore, when he was born, and brought up in the foregoing\r\nmanner, and came to the age of maturity, made his virtue manifest to the\r\nEgyptians; and showed that he was born for the bringing them down, and\r\nraising the Israelites. And the occasion he laid hold of was this:—The\r\nEthiopians, who are next neighbors to the Egyptians, made an inroad into\r\ntheir country, which they seized upon, and carried off the effects of\r\nthe Egyptians, who, in their rage, fought against them, and revenged the\r\naffronts they had received from them; but being overcome in battle, some\r\nof them were slain, and the rest ran away in a shameful manner, and by\r\nthat means saved themselves; whereupon the Ethiopians followed after\r\nthem in the pursuit, and thinking that it would be a mark of cowardice\r\nif they did not subdue all Egypt, they went on to subdue the rest with\r\ngreater vehemence; and when they had tasted the sweets of the country,\r\nthey never left off the prosecution of the war: and as the nearest parts\r\nhad not courage enough at first to fight with them, they proceeded as\r\nfar as Memphis, and the sea itself, while not one of the cities was able\r\nto oppose them. The Egyptians, under this sad oppression, betook\r\nthemselves to their oracles and prophecies; and when God had given them\r\nthis counsel, to make use of Moses the Hebrew, and take his assistance,\r\nthe king commanded his daughter to produce him, that he might be the\r\ngeneral 22 of their army. Upon which, when she had made him swear he\r\nwould do him no harm, she delivered him to the king, and supposed his\r\nassistance would be of great advantage to them. She withal reproached\r\nthe priest, who, when they had before admonished the Egyptians to kill\r\nhim, was not ashamed now to own their want of his help.\r\n\r\n2. So Moses, at the persuasion both of Thermuthis and the king himself,\r\ncheerfully undertook the business: and the sacred scribes of both\r\nnations were glad; those of the Egyptians, that they should at once\r\novercome their enemies by his valor, and that by the same piece of\r\nmanagement Moses would be slain; but those of the Hebrews, that they\r\nshould escape from the Egyptians, because Moses was to be their general.\r\nBut Moses prevented the enemies, and took and led his army before those\r\nenemies were apprized of his attacking them; for he did not march by the\r\nriver, but by land, where he gave a wonderful demonstration of his\r\nsagacity; for when the ground was difficult to be passed over, because\r\nof the multitude of serpents, [which it produces in vast numbers, and,\r\nindeed, is singular in some of those productions, which other countries\r\ndo not breed, and yet such as are worse than others in power and\r\nmischief, and an unusual fierceness of sight, some of which ascend out\r\nof the ground unseen, and also fly in the air, and so come upon men at\r\nunawares, and do them a mischief,] Moses invented a wonderful stratagem\r\nto preserve the army safe, and without hurt; for he made baskets, like\r\nunto arks, of sedge, and filled them with ibes, 23 and carried them\r\nalong with them; which animal is the greatest enemy to serpents\r\nimaginable, for they fly from them when they come near them; and as they\r\nfly they are caught and devoured by them, as if it were done by the\r\nharts; but the ibes are tame creatures, and only enemies to the\r\nserpentine kind: but about these ibes I say no more at present, since\r\nthe Greeks themselves are not unacquainted with this sort of bird. As\r\nsoon, therefore, as Moses was come to the land which was the breeder of\r\nthese serpents, he let loose the ibes, and by their means repelled the\r\nserpentine kind, and used them for his assistants before the army came\r\nupon that ground. When he had therefore proceeded thus on his journey,\r\nhe came upon the Ethiopians before they expected him; and, joining\r\nbattle with them, he beat them, and deprived them of the hopes they had\r\nof success against the Egyptians, and went on in overthrowing their\r\ncities, and indeed made a great slaughter of these Ethiopians. Now when\r\nthe Egyptian army had once tasted of this prosperous success, by the\r\nmeans of Moses, they did not slacken their diligence, insomuch that the\r\nEthiopians were in danger of being reduced to slavery, and all sorts of\r\ndestruction; and at length they retired to Saba, which was a royal city\r\nof Ethiopia, which Cambyses afterwards named Mero, after the name of his\r\nown sister. The place was to be besieged with very great difficulty,\r\nsince it was both encompassed by the Nile quite round, and the other\r\nrivers, Astapus and Astaboras, made it a very difficult thing for such\r\nas attempted to pass over them; for the city was situate in a retired\r\nplace, and was inhabited after the manner of an island, being\r\nencompassed with a strong wall, and having the rivers to guard them from\r\ntheir enemies, and having great ramparts between the wall and the\r\nrivers, insomuch, that when the waters come with the greatest violence,\r\nit can never be drowned; which ramparts make it next to impossible for\r\neven such as are gotten over the rivers to take the city. However, while\r\nMoses was uneasy at the army's lying idle, [for the enemies durst not\r\ncome to a battle,] this accident happened:—Tharbis was the daughter of\r\nthe king of the Ethiopians: she happened to see Moses as he led the army\r\nnear the walls, and fought with great courage; and admiring the subtilty\r\nof his undertakings, and believing him to be the author of the\r\nEgyptians' success, when they had before despaired of recovering their\r\nliberty, and to be the occasion of the great danger the Ethiopians were\r\nin, when they had before boasted of their great achievements, she fell\r\ndeeply in love with him; and upon the prevalancy of that passion, sent\r\nto him the most faithful of all her servants to discourse with him about\r\ntheir marriage. He thereupon accepted the offer, on condition she would\r\nprocure the delivering up of the city; and gave her the assurance of an\r\noath to take her to his wife; and that when he had once taken possession\r\nof the city, he would not break his oath to her. No sooner was the\r\nagreement made, but it took effect immediately; and when Moses had cut\r\noff the Ethiopians, he gave thanks to God, and consummated his marriage,\r\nand led the Egyptians back to their own land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. How Moses Fled Out Of Egypt Into Midian.\r\n\r\n1. Now the Egyptians, after they had been preserved by Moses,\r\nentertained a hatred to him, and were very eager in compassing their\r\ndesigns against him, as suspecting that he would take occasion, from his\r\ngood success, to raise a sedition, and bring innovations into Egypt; and\r\ntold the king he ought to be slain. The king had also some intentions of\r\nhimself to the same purpose, and this as well out of envy at his\r\nglorious expedition at the head of his army, as out of fear of being\r\nbrought low by him and being instigated by the sacred scribes, he was\r\nready to undertake to kill Moses: but when he had learned beforehand\r\nwhat plots there were against him, he went away privately; and because\r\nthe public roads were watched, he took his flight through the deserts,\r\nand where his enemies could not suspect he would travel; and, though he\r\nwas destitute of food, he went on, and despised that difficulty\r\ncourageously; and when he came to the city Midian, which lay upon the\r\nRed Sea, and was so denominated from one of Abraham's sons by Keturah,\r\nhe sat upon a certain well, and rested himself there after his laborious\r\njourney, and the affliction he had been in. It was not far from the\r\ncity, and the time of the day was noon, where he had an occasion offered\r\nhim by the custom of the country of doing what recommended his virtue,\r\nand afforded him an opportunity of bettering his circumstances.\r\n\r\n2. For that country having but little water, the shepherds used to seize\r\non the wells before others came, lest their flocks should want water,\r\nand lest it should be spent by others before they came. There were now\r\ncome, therefore, to this well seven sisters that were virgins, the\r\ndaughters of Raguel, a priest, and one thought worthy by the people of\r\nthe country of great honor. These virgins, who took care of their\r\nfather's flocks, which sort of work it was customary and very familiar\r\nfor women to do in the country of the Troglodytes, they came first of\r\nall, and drew water out of the well in a quantity sufficient for their\r\nflocks, into troughs, which were made for the reception of that water;\r\nbut when the shepherds came upon the maidens, and drove them away, that\r\nthey might have the command of the water themselves, Moses, thinking it\r\nwould be a terrible reproach upon him if he overlooked the young women\r\nunder unjust oppression, and should suffer the violence of the men to\r\nprevail over the right of the maidens, he drove away the men, who had a\r\nmind to more than their share, and afforded a proper assistance to the\r\nwomen; who, when they had received such a benefit from him, came to\r\ntheir father, and told him how they had been affronted by the shepherds,\r\nand assisted by a stranger, and entreated that he would not let this\r\ngenerous action be done in vain, nor go without a reward. Now the father\r\ntook it well from his daughters that they were so desirous to reward\r\ntheir benefactor; and bid them bring Moses into his presence, that he\r\nmight be rewarded as he deserved. And when Moses came, he told him what\r\ntestimony his daughters bare to him, that he had assisted them; and\r\nthat, as he admired him for his virtue, he said that Moses had bestowed\r\nsuch his assistance on persons not insensible of benefits, but where\r\nthey were both able and willing to return the kindness, and even to\r\nexceed the measure of his generosity. So he made him his son, and gave\r\nhim one of his daughters in marriage; and appointed him to be the\r\nguardian and superintendent over his cattle; for of old, all the wealth\r\nof the barbarians was in those cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. Concerning The Burning Bush And The Rod Of Moses.\r\n\r\n1. Now Moses, when he had obtained the favor of Jethro, for that was one\r\nof the names of Raguel, staid there and fed his flock; but some time\r\nafterward, taking his station at the mountain called Sinai, he drove his\r\nflocks thither to feed them. Now this is the highest of all the\r\nmountains thereabout, and the best for pasturage, the herbage being\r\nthere good; and it had not been before fed upon, because of the opinion\r\nmen had that God dwelt there, the shepherds not daring to ascend up to\r\nit; and here it was that a wonderful prodigy happened to Moses; for a\r\nfire fed upon a thorn bush, yet did the green leaves and the flowers\r\ncontinue untouched, and the fire did not at all consume the fruit\r\nbranches, although the flame was great and fierce. Moses was affrighted\r\nat this strange sight, as it was to him; but he was still more\r\nastonished when the fire uttered a voice, and called to him by name, and\r\nspake words to him, by which it signified how bold he had been in\r\nventuring to come into a place whither no man had ever come before,\r\nbecause the place was divine; and advised him to remove a great way off\r\nfrom the flame, and to be contented with what he had seen; and though he\r\nwere himself a good man, and the offspring of great men, yet that he\r\nshould not pry any further; and he foretold to him, that he should have\r\nglory and honor among men, by the blessing of God upon him. He also\r\ncommanded him to go away thence with confidence to Egypt, in order to\r\nhis being the commander and conductor of the body of the Hebrews, and to\r\nhis delivering his own people from the injuries they suffered there:\r\n\"For,\" said God, \"they shall inhabit this happy land which your\r\nforefather Abraham inhabited, and shall have the enjoyment of all good\r\nthings.\" But still he enjoined them, when he brought the Hebrews out of\r\nthe land of Egypt, to come to that place, and to offer sacrifices of\r\nthanksgiving there, Such were the divine oracles which were delivered\r\nout of the fire.\r\n\r\n2. But Moses was astonished at what he saw, and much more at what he\r\nheard; and he said, \"I think it would be an instance of too great\r\nmadness, O Lord, for one of that regard I bear to thee, to distrust thy\r\npower, since I myself adore it, and know that it has been made manifest\r\nto my progenitors: but I am still in doubt how I, who am a private man,\r\nand one of no abilities, should either persuade my own countrymen to\r\nleave the country they now inhabit, and to follow me to a land whither I\r\nlead them; or, if they should be persuaded, how can I force Pharaoh to\r\npermit them to depart, since they augment their own wealth and\r\nprosperity by the labors and works they put upon them?\"\r\n\r\n3. But God persuaded him to be courageous on all occasions, and promised\r\nto be with him, and to assist him in his words, when he was to persuade\r\nmen; and in his deeds, when he was to perform wonders. He bid him also\r\nto take a signal of the truth of what he said, by throwing his rod upon\r\nthe ground, which, when he had done, it crept along, and was become a\r\nserpent, and rolled itself round in its folds, and erected its head, as\r\nready to revenge itself on such as should assault it; after which it\r\nbecome a rod again as it was before. After this God bid Moses to put his\r\nright hand into his bosom: he obeyed, and when he took it out it was\r\nwhite, and in color like to chalk, but afterward it returned to its\r\nwonted color again. He also, upon God's command, took some of the water\r\nthat was near him, and poured it upon the ground, and saw the color was\r\nthat of blood. Upon the wonder that Moses showed at these signs, God\r\nexhorted him to be of good courage, and to be assured that he would be\r\nthe greatest support to him; and bid him make use of those signs, in\r\norder to obtain belief among all men, that \"thou art sent by me, and\r\ndost all things according to my commands. Accordingly I enjoin thee to\r\nmake no more delays, but to make haste to Egypt, and to travel night and\r\nday, and not to draw out the time, and so make the slavery of the\r\nHebrews and their sufferings to last the longer.\"\r\n\r\n4. Moses having now seen and heard these wonders that assured him of the\r\ntruth of these promises of God, had no room left him to disbelieve them:\r\nhe entreated him to grant him that power when he should be in Egypt; and\r\nbesought him to vouchsafe him the knowledge of his own name; and since\r\nhe had heard and seen him, that he would also tell him his name, that\r\nwhen he offered sacrifice he might invoke him by such his name in his\r\noblations. Whereupon God declared to him his holy name, which had never\r\nbeen discovered to men before; concerning which it is not lawful for me\r\nto say any more 24 Now these signs accompanied Moses, not then only, but\r\nalways when he prayed for them: of all which signs he attributed the\r\nfirmest assent to the fire in the bush; and believing that God would be\r\na gracious supporter to him, he hoped he should be able to deliver his\r\nown nation, and bring calamities on the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. How Moses And Aaron Returned Into Egypt To Pharaoh.\r\n\r\n1. So Moses, when he understood that the Pharaoh, in whose reign he fled\r\naway, was dead, asked leave of Raguel to go to Egypt, for the benefit of\r\nhis own people. And he took with him Zipporah, the daughter of Raguel,\r\nwhom he had married, and the children he had by her, Gersom and Eleazer,\r\nand made haste into Egypt. Now the former of those names, Gersom, in the\r\nHebrew tongue, signifies that he was in a strange land; and Eleazer,\r\nthat, by the assistance of the God of his fathers, he had escaped from\r\nthe Egyptians. Now when they were near the borders, Aaron his brother,\r\nby the command of God, met him, to whom he declared what had befallen\r\nhim at the mountain, and the commands that God had given him. But as\r\nthey were going forward, the chief men among the Hebrews, having learned\r\nthat they were coming, met them: to whom Moses declared the signs he had\r\nseen; and while they could not believe them, he made them see them, So\r\nthey took courage at these surprising and unexpected sights, and hoped\r\nwell of their entire deliverance, as believing now that God took care of\r\ntheir preservation.\r\n\r\n2. Since then Moses found that the Hebrews would be obedient to\r\nwhatsoever he should direct, as they promised to be, and were in love\r\nwith liberty, he came to the king, who had indeed but lately received\r\nthe government, and told him how much he had done for the good of the\r\nEgyptians, when they were despised by the Ethiopians, and their country\r\nlaid waste by them; and how he had been the commander of their forces,\r\nand had labored for them, as if they had been his own people and he\r\ninformed him in what danger he had been during that expedition, without\r\nhaving any proper returns made him as he had deserved. He also informed\r\nhim distinctly what things happened to him at Mount Sinai; and what God\r\nsaid to him; and the signs that were done by God, in order to assure him\r\nof the authority of those commands which he had given him. He also\r\nexhorted him not to disbelieve what he told him, nor to oppose the will\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n3. But when the king derided Moses; he made him in earnest see the signs\r\nthat were done at Mount Sinai. Yet was the king very angry with him and\r\ncalled him an ill man, who had formerly run away from his Egyptian\r\nslavery, and came now back with deceitful tricks, and wonders, and\r\nmagical arts, to astonish him. And when he had said this, he commanded\r\nthe priests to let him see the same wonderful sights; as knowing that\r\nthe Egyptians were skillful in this kind of learning, and that he was\r\nnot the only person who knew them, and pretended them to be divine; as\r\nalso he told him, that when he brought such wonderful sights before him,\r\nhe would only be believed by the unlearned. Now when the priests threw\r\ndown their rods, they became serpents. But Moses was not daunted at it;\r\nand said, \"O king, I do not myself despise the wisdom of the Egyptians,\r\nbut I say that what I do is so much superior to what these do by magic\r\narts and tricks, as Divine power exceeds the power of man: but I will\r\ndemonstrate that what I do is not done by craft, or counterfeiting what\r\nis not really true, but that they appear by the providence and power of\r\nGod.\" And when he had said this, he cast his rod down upon the ground,\r\nand commanded it to turn itself into a serpent. It obeyed him, and went\r\nall round, and devoured the rods of the Egyptians, which seemed to be\r\ndragons, until it had consumed them all. It then returned to its own\r\nform, and Moses took it into his hand again.\r\n\r\n4. However, the king was no more moved when it was done than before; and\r\nbeing very angry, he said that he should gain nothing by this his\r\ncunning and shrewdness against the Egyptians;—and he commanded him that\r\nwas the chief taskmaster over the Hebrews, to give them no relaxation\r\nfrom their labors, but to compel them to submit to greater oppressions\r\nthan before; and though he allowed them chaff before for making their\r\nbricks, he would allow it them no longer, but he made them to work hard\r\nat brick-making in the day-time, and to gather chaff in the night. Now\r\nwhen their labor was thus doubled upon them, they laid the blame upon\r\nMoses, because their labor and their misery were on his account become\r\nmore severe to them. But Moses did not let his courage sink for the\r\nking's threatenings; nor did he abate of his zeal on account of the\r\nHebrews' complaints; but he supported himself, and set his soul\r\nresolutely against them both, and used his own utmost diligence to\r\nprocure liberty to his countrymen. So he went to the king, and persuaded\r\nhim to let the Hebrews go to Mount Sinai, and there to sacrifice to God,\r\nbecause God had enjoined them so to do. He persuaded him also not to\r\ncounterwork the designs of God, but to esteem his favor above all\r\nthings, and to permit them to depart, lest, before he be aware, he lay\r\nan obstruction in the way of the Divine commands, and so occasion his\r\nown suffering such punishments as it was probable any one that\r\ncounterworked the Divine commands should undergo, since the severest\r\nafflictions arise from every object to those that provoke the Divine\r\nwrath against them; for such as these have neither the earth nor the air\r\nfor their friends; nor are the fruits of the womb according to nature,\r\nbut every thing is unfriendly and adverse towards them. He said further,\r\nthat the Egyptians should know this by sad experience; and that besides,\r\nthe Hebrew people should go out of their country without their consent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. Concerning The Ten Plagues Which Came Upon The Egyptians.\r\n\r\n1. But when the king despised the words of Moses, and had no regard at\r\nall to them, grievous plagues seized the Egyptians; every one of which I\r\nwill describe, both because no such plagues did ever happen to any other\r\nnation as the Egyptians now felt, and because I would demonstrate that\r\nMoses did not fail in any one thing that he foretold them; and because\r\nit is for the good of mankind, that they may learn this caution—Not to\r\ndo anything that may displease God, lest he be provoked to wrath, and\r\navenge their iniquities upon them. For the Egyptian river ran with\r\nbloody water at the command of God, insomuch that it could not be drunk,\r\nand they had no other spring of water neither; for the water was not\r\nonly of the color of blood, but it brought upon those that ventured to\r\ndrink of it, great pains and bitter torment. Such was the river to the\r\nEgyptians; but it was sweet and fit for drinking to the Hebrews, and no\r\nway different from what it naturally used to be. As the king therefore\r\nknew not what to do in these surprising circumstances, and was in fear\r\nfor the Egyptians, he gave the Hebrews leave to go away; but when the\r\nplague ceased, he changed his mind again, end would not suffer them to\r\ngo. 25\r\n\r\n2. But when God saw that he was ungrateful, and upon the ceasing of this\r\ncalamity would not grow wiser, he sent another plague upon the\r\nEgyptians:—An innumerable multitude of frogs consumed the fruit of the\r\nground; the river was also full of them, insomuch that those who drew\r\nwater had it spoiled by the blood of these animals, as they died in, and\r\nwere destroyed by, the water; and the country was full of filthy slime,\r\nas they were born, and as they died: they also spoiled their vessels in\r\ntheir houses which they used, and were found among what they eat and\r\nwhat they drank, and came in great numbers upon their beds. There was\r\nalso an ungrateful smell, and a stink arose from them, as they were\r\nborn, and as they died therein. Now, when the Egyptians were under the\r\noppression of these miseries, the king ordered Moses to take the Hebrews\r\nwith him, and be gone. Upon which the whole multitude of the frogs\r\nvanished away; and both the land and the river returned to their former\r\nnatures. But as soon as Pharaoh saw the land freed from this plague, he\r\nforgot the cause of it, and retained the Hebrews; and, as though he had\r\na mind to try the nature of more such judgments, he would not yet suffer\r\nMoses and his people to depart, having granted that liberty rather out\r\nof fear than out of any good consideration.\r\n\r\n3. Accordingly, God punished his falseness with another plague, added to\r\nthe former; for there arose out of the bodies of the Egyptians an\r\ninnumerable quantity of lice, by which, wicked as they were, they\r\nmiserably perished, as not able to destroy this sort of vermin either\r\nwith washes or with ointments. At which terrible judgment the king of\r\nEgypt was in disorder, upon the fear into which he reasoned himself,\r\nlest his people should be destroyed, and that the manner of this death\r\nwas also reproachful, so that he was forced in part to recover himself\r\nfrom his wicked temper to a sounder mind, for he gave leave for the\r\nHebrews themselves to depart. But when the plague thereupon ceased, he\r\nthought it proper to require that they should leave their children and\r\nwives behind them, as pledges of their return; whereby he provoked God\r\nto be more vehemently angry at him, as if he thought to impose on his\r\nprovidence, and as if it were only Moses, and not God, who punished the\r\nEgyptians for the sake of the Hebrews: for he filled that country full\r\nof various sorts of pestilential creatures, with their various\r\nproperties, such indeed as had never come into the sight of men before,\r\nby whose means the men perished themselves, and the land was destitute\r\nof husbandmen for its cultivation; but if any thing escaped destruction\r\nfrom them, it was killed by a distemper which the men underwent also.\r\n\r\n4. But when Pharaoh did not even then yield to the will of God, but,\r\nwhile he gave leave to the husbands to take their wives with them, yet\r\ninsisted that the children should be left behind, God presently resolved\r\nto punish his wickedness with several sorts of calamities, and those\r\nworse than the foregoing, which yet had so generally afflicted them; for\r\ntheir bodies had terrible boils, breaking forth with blains, while they\r\nwere already inwardly consumed; and a great part of the Egyptians\r\nperished in this manner. But when the king was not brought to reason by\r\nthis plague, hail was sent down from heaven; and such hail it was, as\r\nthe climate of Egypt had never suffered before, nor was it like to that\r\nwhich falls in other climates in winter time, 26 but was larger than\r\nthat which falls in the middle of spring to those that dwell in the\r\nnorthern and north-western regions. This hail broke down their boughs\r\nladen with fruit. After this a tribe of locusts consumed the seed which\r\nwas not hurt by the hail; so that to the Egyptians all hopes of the\r\nfuture fruits of the ground were entirely lost.\r\n\r\n5. One would think the forementioned calamities might have been\r\nsufficient for one that was only foolish, without wickedness, to make\r\nhim wise, and to make him Sensible what was for his advantage. But\r\nPharaoh, led not so much by his folly as by his wickedness, even when he\r\nsaw the cause of his miseries, he still contested with God, and\r\nwillfully deserted the cause of virtue; so he bid Moses take the Hebrews\r\naway, with their wives and children, to leave their cattle behind, since\r\ntheir own cattle were destroyed. But when Moses said that what he\r\ndesired was unjust, since they were obliged to offer sacrifices to God\r\nof those cattle, and the time being prolonged on this account, a thick\r\ndarkness, without the least light, spread itself over the Egyptians,\r\nwhereby their sight being obstructed, and their breathing hindered by\r\nthe thickness of the air, they died miserably, and under a terror lest\r\nthey should be swallowed up by the dark cloud. Besides this, when the\r\ndarkness, after three days and as many nights, was dissipated, and when\r\nPharaoh did not still repent and let the Hebrews go, Moses came to him\r\nand said, \"How long wilt thou be disobedient to the command of God? for\r\nhe enjoins thee to let the Hebrews go; nor is there any other way of\r\nbeing freed from the calamities you are under, unless you do so.\" But\r\nthe king angry at what he said, and threatened to cut off his head if he\r\ncame any more to trouble him these matters. Hereupon Moses said he not\r\nspeak to him any more about them, for he himself, together with the\r\nprincipal men among the Egyptians, should desire the Hebrews away. So\r\nwhen Moses had said this, he his way.\r\n\r\n6. But when God had signified, that with one plague he would compel the\r\nEgyptians to let Hebrews go, he commanded Moses to tell the people that\r\nthey should have a sacrifice ready, and they should prepare themselves\r\non the tenth day of the month Xanthicus, against the fourteenth, [which\r\nmonth is called by the Egyptians Pharmuth, Nisan by the Hebrews; but the\r\nMacedonians call it Xanthicus,] and that he should carry the Hebrews\r\nwith all they had. Accordingly, he having got the Hebrews ready for\r\ntheir departure, and having sorted the people into tribes, he kept them\r\ntogether in one place: but when the fourteenth day was come, and all\r\nwere ready to depart they offered the sacrifice, and purified their\r\nhouses with the blood, using bunches of hyssop for that purpose; and\r\nwhen they had supped, they burnt the remainder of the flesh, as just\r\nready to depart. Whence it is that we do still offer this sacrifice in\r\nlike manner to this day, and call this festival Pascha which signifies\r\nthe feast of the passover; because on that day God passed us over, and\r\nsent the plague upon the Egyptians; for the destruction of the first-\r\nborn came upon the Egyptians that night, so that many of the Egyptians\r\nwho lived near the king's palace, persuaded Pharaoh to let the Hebrews\r\ngo. Accordingly he called for Moses, and bid them be gone; as supposing,\r\nthat if once the Hebrews were gone out of the country, Egypt should be\r\nfreed from its miseries. They also honored the Hebrews with gifts; 27\r\nsome, in order to get them to depart quickly, and others on account of\r\ntheir neighborhood, and the friendship they had with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15. How The Hebrews Under The Conduct Of Moses Left Egypt.\r\n\r\n1. So the Hebrews went out of Egypt, while the Egyptians wept, and\r\nrepented that they had treated them so hardly.—Now they took their\r\njourney by Letopolis, a place at that time deserted, but where Babylon\r\nwas built afterwards, when Cambyses laid Egypt waste: but as they went\r\naway hastily, on the third day they came to a place called Beelzephon,\r\non the Red Sea; and when they had no food out of the land, because it\r\nwas a desert, they eat of loaves kneaded of flour, only warmed by a\r\ngentle heat; and this food they made use of for thirty days; for what\r\nthey brought with them out of Egypt would not suffice them any longer\r\ntime; and this only while they dispensed it to each person, to use so\r\nmuch only as would serve for necessity, but not for satiety. Whence it\r\nis that, in memory of the want we were then in, we keep a feast for\r\neight days, which is called the feast of unleavened bread. Now the\r\nentire multitude of those that went out, including the women and\r\nchildren, was not easy to be numbered, but those that were of an age fit\r\nfor war, were six hundred thousand.\r\n\r\n2. They left Egypt in the month Xanthicus, on the fifteenth day of the\r\nlunar month; four hundred and thirty years after our forefather Abraham\r\ncame into Canaan, but two hundred and fifteen years only after Jacob\r\nremoved into Egypt. 28 It was the eightieth year of the age of Moses,\r\nand of that of Aaron three more. They also carried out the bones of\r\nJoesph with them, as he had charged his sons to do.\r\n\r\n3. But the Egyptians soon repented that the Hebrews were gone; and the\r\nking also was mightily concerned that this had been procured by the\r\nmagic arts of Moses; so they resolved to go after them. Accordingly they\r\ntook their weapons, and other warlike furniture, and pursued after them,\r\nin order to bring them back, if once they overtook them, because they\r\nwould now have no pretense to pray to God against them, since they had\r\nalready been permitted to go out; and they thought they should easily\r\novercome them, as they had no armor, and would be weary with their\r\njourney; so they made haste in their pursuit, and asked of every one\r\nthey met which way they were gone. And indeed that land was difficult to\r\nbe traveled over, not only by armies, but by single persons. Now Moses\r\nled the Hebrews this way, that in case the Egyptians should repent and\r\nbe desirous to pursue after them, they might undergo the punishment of\r\ntheir wickedness, and of the breach of those promises they had made to\r\nthem. As also he led them this way on account of the Philistines, who\r\nhad quarreled with them, and hated them of old, that by all means they\r\nmight not know of their departure, for their country is near to that of\r\nEgypt; and thence it was that Moses led them not along the road that\r\ntended to the land of the Philistines, but he was desirous that they\r\nshould go through the desert, that so after a long journey, and after\r\nmany afflictions, they might enter upon the land of Canaan. Another\r\nreason of this was, that God commanded him to bring the people to Mount\r\nSinai, that there they might offer him sacrifices. Now when the\r\nEgyptians had overtaken the Hebrews, they prepared to fight them, and by\r\ntheir multitude they drove them into a narrow place; for the number that\r\npursued after them was six hundred chariots, with fifty thousand\r\nhorsemen, and two hundred thousand foot-men, all armed. They also seized\r\non the passages by which they imagined the Hebrews might fly, shutting\r\nthem up 29 between inaccessible precipices and the sea; for there was\r\n[on each side] a [ridge of] mountains that terminated at the sea, which\r\nwere impassable by reason of their roughness, and obstructed their\r\nflight; wherefore they there pressed upon the Hebrews with their army,\r\nwhere [the ridges of] the mountains were closed with the sea; which army\r\nthey placed at the chops of the mountains, that so they might deprive\r\nthem of any passage into the plain.\r\n\r\n4. When the Hebrews, therefore, were neither able to bear up, being\r\nthus, as it were, besieged, because they wanted provisions, nor saw any\r\npossible way of escaping; and if they should have thought of fighting,\r\nthey had no weapons; they expected a universal destruction, unless they\r\ndelivered themselves up to the Egyptians. So they laid the blame on\r\nMoses, and forgot all the signs that had been wrought by God for the\r\nrecovery of their freedom; and this so far, that their incredulity\r\nprompted them to throw stones at the prophet, while he encouraged them\r\nand promised them deliverance; and they resolved that they would deliver\r\nthemselves up to the Egyptians. So there was sorrow and lamentation\r\namong the women and children, who had nothing but destruction before\r\ntheir eyes, while they were encompassed with mountains, the sea, and\r\ntheir enemies, and discerned no way of flying from them.\r\n\r\n5. But Moses, though the multitude looked fiercely at him, did not,\r\nhowever, give over the care of them, but despised all dangers, out of\r\nhis trust in God, who, as he had afforded them the several steps already\r\ntaken for the recovery of their liberty, which he had foretold them,\r\nwould not now suffer them to be subdued by their enemies, to be either\r\nmade slaves or be slain by them; and, standing in midst of them, he\r\nsaid, \"It is not just of us to distrust even men, when they have\r\nhitherto well managed our affairs, as if they would not be the same\r\nhereafter; but it is no better than madness, at this time to despair of\r\nthe providence of God, by whose power all those things have been\r\nperformed he promised, when you expected no such things: I mean all that\r\nI have been concerned in for deliverance and escape from slavery. Nay,\r\nwhen we are in the utmost distress, as you see we ought rather to hope\r\nthat God will succor us, by whose operation it is that we are now in\r\nthis narrow place, that he may out of such difficulties as are otherwise\r\ninsurmountable and out of which neither you nor your enemies expect you\r\ncan be delivered, and may at once demonstrate his own power and his\r\nprovidence over us. Nor does God use to give his help in small\r\ndifficulties to those whom he favors, but in such cases where no one can\r\nsee how any hope in man can better their condition. Depend, therefore,\r\nupon such a Protector as is able to make small things great, and to show\r\nthat this mighty force against you is nothing but weakness, and be not\r\naffrighted at the Egyptian army, nor do you despair of being preserved,\r\nbecause the sea before, and the mountains behind, afford you no\r\nopportunity for flying, for even these mountains, if God so please, may\r\nbe made plain ground for you, and the sea become dry land.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16. How The Sea Was Divided Asunder For The Hebrews, When They\r\nWere Pursued By The Egyptians, And So Gave Them An Opportunity Of\r\nEscaping From Them.\r\n\r\n1. When Moses had said this, he led them to the sea, while the Egyptians\r\nlooked on; for they were within sight. Now these were so distressed by\r\nthe toil of their pursuit, that they thought proper to put off fighting\r\ntill the next day. But when Moses was come to the sea-shore, he took his\r\nrod, and made supplication to God, and called upon him to be their\r\nhelper and assistant; and said \"Thou art not ignorant, O Lord, that it\r\nis beyond human strength and human contrivance to avoid the difficulties\r\nwe are now under; but it must be thy work altogether to procure\r\ndeliverance to this army, which has left Egypt at thy appointment. We\r\ndespair of any other assistance or contrivance, and have recourse only\r\nto that hope we have in thee; and if there be any method that can\r\npromise us an escape by thy providence, we look up to thee for it. And\r\nlet it come quickly, and manifest thy power to us; and do thou raise up\r\nthis people unto good courage and hope of deliverance, who are deeply\r\nsunk into a disconsolate state of mind. We are in a helpless place, but\r\nstill it is a place that thou possessest; still the sea is thine, the\r\nmountains also that enclose us are thine; so that these mountains will\r\nopen themselves if thou commandest them, and the sea also, if thou\r\ncommandest it, will become dry land. Nay, we might escape by a flight\r\nthrough the air, if thou shouldst determine we should have that way of\r\nsalvation.\"\r\n\r\n2. When Moses had thus addressed himself to God, he smote the sea with\r\nhis rod, which parted asunder at the stroke, and receiving those waters\r\ninto itself, left the ground dry, as a road and a place of flight for\r\nthe Hebrews. Now when Moses saw this appearance of God, and that the sea\r\nwent out of its own place, and left dry land, he went first of all into\r\nit, and bid the Hebrews to follow him along that divine road, and to\r\nrejoice at the danger their enemies that followed them were in; and gave\r\nthanks to God for this so surprising a deliverance which appeared from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n3. Now, while these Hebrews made no stay, but went on earnestly, as led\r\nby God's presence with them, the Egyptians supposed first that they were\r\ndistracted, and were going rashly upon manifest destruction. But when\r\nthey saw that they were going a great way without any harm, and that no\r\nobstacle or difficulty fell in their journey, they made haste to pursue\r\nthem, hoping that the sea would be calm for them also. They put their\r\nhorse foremost, and went down themselves into the sea. Now the Hebrews,\r\nwhile these were putting on their armor, and therein spending their\r\ntime, were beforehand with them, and escaped them, and got first over to\r\nthe land on the other side without any hurt. Whence the others were\r\nencouraged, and more courageously pursued them, as hoping no harm would\r\ncome to them neither: but the Egyptians were not aware that they went\r\ninto a road made for the Hebrews, and not for others; that this road was\r\nmade for the deliverance of those in danger, but not for those that were\r\nearnest to make use of it for the others' destruction. As soon,\r\ntherefore, as ever the whole Egyptian army was within it, the sea flowed\r\nto its own place, and came down with a torrent raised by storms of wind,\r\n30 and encompassed the Egyptians. Showers of rain also came down from\r\nthe sky, and dreadful thunders and lightning, with flashes of fire.\r\nThunderbolts also were darted upon them. Nor was there any thing which\r\nused to be sent by God upon men, as indications of his wrath, which did\r\nnot happen at this time, for a dark and dismal night oppressed them. And\r\nthus did all these men perish, so that there was not one man left to be\r\na messenger of this calamity to the rest of the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n4. But the Hebrews were not able to contain themselves for joy at their\r\nwonderful deliverance, and destruction of their enemies; now indeed\r\nsupposing themselves firmly delivered, when those that would have forced\r\nthem into slavery were destroyed, and when they found they had God so\r\nevidently for their protector. And now these Hebrews having escaped the\r\ndanger they were in, after this manner, and besides that, seeing their\r\nenemies punished in such a way as is never recorded of any other men\r\nwhomsoever, were all the night employed in singing of hymns, and in\r\nmirth. 31 Moses also composed a song unto God, containing his praises,\r\nand a thanksgiving for his kindness, in hexameter verse. 32\r\n\r\n5. As for myself, I have delivered every part of this history as I found\r\nit in the sacred books; nor let any one wonder at the strangeness of the\r\nnarration if a way were discovered to those men of old time, who were\r\nfree from the wickedness of the modern ages, whether it happened by the\r\nwill of God or whether it happened of its own accord;—while, for the\r\nsake of those that accompanied Alexander, king of Macedonia, who yet\r\nlived, comparatively but a little while ago, the Pamphylian Sea retired\r\nand afforded them a passage 33 through itself, had no other way to go; I\r\nmean, when it was the will of God to destroy the monarchy of the\r\nPersians: and this is confessed to be true by all that have written\r\nabout the actions of Alexander. But as to these events, let every one\r\ndetermine as he pleases.\r\n\r\n6. On the next day Moses gathered together the weapons of the Egyptians,\r\nwhich were brought to the camp of the Hebrews by the current of the sea,\r\nand the force of the winds resisting it; and he conjectured that this\r\nalso happened by Divine Providence, that so they might not be destitute\r\nof weapons. So when he had ordered the Hebrews to arm themselves with\r\nthem, he led them to Mount Sinai, in order to offer sacrifice to God,\r\nand to render oblations for the salvation of the multitude, as he was\r\ncharged to do beforehand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ We may here observe, that in correspondence to Joseph's\r\nsecond dream, which implied that his mother, who was then alive, as well\r\nas his father, should come and bow down to him, Josephus represents her\r\nhere as still alive after she was dead, for the decorum of the dream\r\nthat foretold it, as the interpretation of the dream does also in all\r\nour copies, Genesis 37:10.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ The Septuagint have twenty pieces of gold; the Testament of\r\nGad thirty; the Hebrew and Samaritan twenty of silver; and the vulgar\r\nLatin thirty.

Containing The Interval Of Two Years.—From The Exodus Out Of\r\nEgypt, To The Rejection Of That Generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. How Moses When He Had Brought The People Out Of Egypt Led\r\nThem To Mount Sinai; But Not Till They Had Suffered Much In Their\r\nJourney.\r\n\r\n1. When the Hebrews had obtained such a wonderful deliverance, the\r\ncountry was a great trouble to them, for it was entirely a desert, and\r\nwithout sustenance for them; and also had exceeding little water, so\r\nthat it not only was not at all sufficient for the men, but not enough\r\nto feed any of the cattle, for it was parched up, and had no moisture\r\nthat might afford nutriment to the vegetables; so they were forced to\r\ntravel over this country, as having no other country but this to travel\r\nin. They had indeed carried water along with them from the land over\r\nwhich they had traveled before, as their conductor had bidden them; but\r\nwhen that was spent, they were obliged to draw water out of wells, with\r\npain, by reason of the hardness of the soil. Moreover, what water they\r\nfound was bitter, and not fit for drinking, and this in small quantities\r\nalso; and as they thus traveled, they came late in the evening to a\r\nplace called Marah, 1 which had that name from the badness of its water,\r\nfor Mar denotes bitterness. Thither they came afflicted both by the\r\ntediousness of their journey, and by their want of food, for it entirely\r\nfailed them at that time. Now here was a well, which made them choose to\r\nstay in the place, which, although it were not sufficient to satisfy so\r\ngreat an army, did yet afford them some comfort, as found in such desert\r\nplaces; for they heard from those who had been to search, that there was\r\nnothing to be found, if they traveled on farther. Yet was this water\r\nbitter, and not fit for men to drink; and not only so, but it was\r\nintolerable even to the cattle themselves.\r\n\r\n2. When Moses saw how much the people were cast down, and that the\r\noccasion of it could not be contradicted, for the people were not in the\r\nnature of a complete army of men, who might oppose a manly fortitude to\r\nthe necessity that distressed them; the multitude of the children, and\r\nof the women also, being of too weak capacities to be persuaded by\r\nreason, blunted the courage of the men themselves,—he was therefore in\r\ngreat difficulties, and made everybody's calamity his own; for they ran\r\nall of them to him, and begged of him; the women begged for their\r\ninfants, and the men for the women, that he would not overlook them, but\r\nprocure some way or other for their deliverance. He therefore betook\r\nhimself to prayer to God, that he would change the water from its\r\npresent badness, and make it fit for drinking. And when God had granted\r\nhim that favor, he took the top of a stick that lay down at his feet,\r\nand divided it in the middle, and made the section lengthways. He then\r\nlet it down into the well, and persuaded the Hebrews that God had\r\nhearkened to his prayers, and had promised to render the water such as\r\nthey desired it to be, in case they would be subservient to him in what\r\nhe should enjoin them to do, and this not after a remiss or negligent\r\nmanner. And when they asked what they were to do in order to have the\r\nwater changed for the better, he bid the strongest men among them that\r\nstood there, to draw up water 2 and told them, that when the greatest\r\npart was drawn up, the remainder would be fit to drink. So they labored\r\nat it till the water was so agitated and purged as to be fit to drink.\r\n\r\n3. And now removing from thence they came to Elim; which place looked\r\nwell at a distance, for there was a grove of palm-trees; but when they\r\ncame near to it, it appeared to be a bad place, for the palm-trees were\r\nno more than seventy; and they were ill-grown and creeping trees, by the\r\nwant of water, for the country about was all parched, and no moisture\r\nsufficient to water them, and make them hopeful and useful, was derived\r\nto them from the fountains, which were in number twelve: they were\r\nrather a few moist places than springs, which not breaking out of the\r\nground, nor running over, could not sufficiently water the trees. And\r\nwhen they dug into the sand, they met with no water; and if they took a\r\nfew drops of it into their hands, they found it to be useless, on\r\naccount of its mud. The trees were too weak to bear fruit, for want of\r\nbeing sufficiently cherished and enlivened by the water. So they laid\r\nthe blame on their conductor, and made heavy complaints against him; and\r\nsaid that this their miserable state, and the experience they had of\r\nadversity, were owing to him; for that they had then journeyed an entire\r\nthirty days, and had spent all the provisions they had brought with\r\nthem; and meeting with no relief, they were in a very desponding\r\ncondition. And by fixing their attention upon nothing but their present\r\nmisfortunes, they were hindered from remembering what deliverances they\r\nhad received from God, and those by the virtue and wisdom of Moses also;\r\nso they were very angry at their conductor, and were zealous in their\r\nattempt to stone him, as the direct occasion of their present miseries.\r\n\r\n4. But as for Moses himself, while the multitude were irritated and\r\nbitterly set against him, he cheerfully relied upon God, and upon his\r\nconsciousness of the care he had taken of these his own people; and he\r\ncame into the midst of them, even while they clamored against him, and\r\nhad stones in their hands in order to despatch him. Now he was of an\r\nagreeable presence, and very able to persuade the people by his\r\nspeeches; accordingly he began to mitigate their anger, and exhorted\r\nthem not to be over-mindful of their present adversities, lest they\r\nshould thereby suffer the benefits that had formerly been bestowed on\r\nthem to slip out of their memories; and he desired them by no means, on\r\naccount of their present uneasiness, to cast those great and wonderful\r\nfavors and gifts, which they had obtained of God, out of their minds,\r\nbut to expect deliverance out of those their present troubles which they\r\ncould not free themselves from, and this by the means of that Divine\r\nProvidence which watched over them. Seeing it is probable that God tries\r\ntheir virtue, and exercises their patience by these adversities, that it\r\nmay appear what fortitude they have, and what memory they retain of his\r\nformer wonderful works in their favor, and whether they will not think\r\nof them upon occasion of the miseries they now feel. He told them, it\r\nappeared they were not really good men, either in patience, or in\r\nremembering what had been successfully done for them, sometimes by\r\ncontemning God and his commands, when by those commands they left the\r\nland of Egypt; and sometimes by behaving themselves ill towards him who\r\nwas the servant of God, and this when he had never deceived them, either\r\nin what he said, or had ordered them to do by God's command. He also put\r\nthem in mind of all that had passed; how the Egyptians were destroyed\r\nwhen they attempted to detain them, contrary to the command of God; and\r\nafter what manner the very same river was to the others bloody, and not\r\nfit for drinking, but was to them sweet, and fit for drinking; and how\r\nthey went a new road through the sea, which fled a long way from them,\r\nby which very means they were themselves preserved, but saw their\r\nenemies destroyed; and that when they were in want of weapons, God gave\r\nthem plenty of them;-and so he recounted all the particular instances,\r\nhow when they were, in appearance, just going to be destroyed, God had\r\nsaved them in a surprising manner; and that he had still the same power;\r\nand that they ought not even now to despair of his providence over them;\r\nand accordingly he exhorted them to continue quiet, and to consider that\r\nhelp would not come too late, though it come not immediately, if it be\r\npresent with them before they suffer any great misfortune; that they\r\nought to reason thus: that God delays to assist them, not because he has\r\nno regard to them, but because he will first try their fortitude, and\r\nthe pleasure they take in their freedom, that he may learn whether you\r\nhave souls great enough to bear want of food, and scarcity of water, on\r\nits account; or whether you rather love to be slaves, as cattle are\r\nslaves to such as own them, and feed them liberally, but only in order\r\nto make them more useful in their service. That as for himself, he shall\r\nnot be so much concerned for his own preservation; for if he die\r\nunjustly, he shall not reckon it any affliction, but that he is\r\nconcerned for them, lest, by casting stones at him, they should be\r\nthought to condemn God himself.\r\n\r\n5. By this means Moses pacified the people, and restrained them from\r\nstoning him, and brought them to repent of what they were going to do.\r\nAnd because he thought the necessity they were under made their passion\r\nless unjustifiable, he thought he ought to apply himself to God by\r\nprayer and supplication; and going up to an eminence, he requested of\r\nGod for some succor for the people, and some way of deliverance from the\r\nwant they were in, because in him, and in him alone, was their hope of\r\nsalvation; and he desired that he would forgive what necessity had\r\nforced the people to do, since such was the nature of mankind, hard to\r\nplease, and very complaining under adversities. Accordingly God promised\r\nhe would take care of them, and afford them the succor they were\r\ndesirous of. Now when Moses had heard this from God, he came down to the\r\nmultitude. But as soon as they saw him joyful at the promises he had\r\nreceived from God, they changed their sad countenances into gladness. So\r\nhe placed himself in the midst of them, and told them he came to bring\r\nthem from God a deliverance from their present distresses. Accordingly a\r\nlittle after came a vast number of quails, which is a bird more\r\nplentiful in this Arabian Gulf than any where else, flying over the sea,\r\nand hovered over them, till wearied with their laborious flight, and,\r\nindeed, as usual, flying very near to the earth, they fell down upon the\r\nHebrews, who caught them, and satisfied their hunger with them, and\r\nsupposed that this was the method whereby God meant to supply them with\r\nfood. Upon which Moses returned thanks to God for affording them his\r\nassistance so suddenly, and sooner than he had promised them.\r\n\r\n6. But presently after this first supply of food, he sent them a second;\r\nfor as Moses was lifting up his hands in prayer, a dew fell down; and\r\nMoses, when he found it stick to his hands, supposed this was also come\r\nfor food from God to them. He tasted it; and perceiving that the people\r\nknew not what it was, and thought it snowed, and that it was what\r\nusually fell at that time of the year, he informed them that this dew\r\ndid not fall from heaven after the manner they imagined, but came for\r\ntheir preservation and sustenance. So he tasted it, and gave them some\r\nof it, that they might be satisfied about what he told them. They also\r\nimitated their conductor, and were pleased with the food, for it was\r\nlike honey in sweetness and pleasant taste, but like in its body to\r\nbdellium, one of the sweet spices, and in bigness equal to coriander\r\nseed. And very earnest they were in gathering it; but they were enjoined\r\nto gather it equally 3—the measure of an omer for each one every day,\r\nbecause this food should not come in too small a quantity, lest the\r\nweaker might not be able to get their share, by reason of the\r\noverbearing of the strong in collecting it. However, these strong men,\r\nwhen they had gathered more than the measure appointed for them, had no\r\nmore than others, but only tired themselves more in gathering it, for\r\nthey found no more than an omer apiece; and the advantage they got by\r\nwhat was superfluous was none at all, it corrupting, both by the worms\r\nbreeding in it, and by its bitterness. So divine and wonderful a food\r\nwas this! It also supplied the want of other sorts of food to those that\r\nfed on it. And even now, in all that place, this manna comes down in\r\nrain, 4 according to what Moses then obtained of God, to send it to the\r\npeople for their sustenance. Now the Hebrews call this food manna: for\r\nthe particle man, in our language, is the asking of a question. What is\r\nthis? So the Hebrews were very joyful at what was sent them from heaven.\r\nNow they made use of this food for forty years, or as long as they were\r\nin the wilderness.\r\n\r\n7. As soon as they were removed thence, they came to Rephidim, being\r\ndistressed to the last degree by thirst; and while in the foregoing days\r\nthey had lit on a few small fountains, but now found the earth entirely\r\ndestitute of water, they were in an evil case. They again turned their\r\nanger against Moses; but he at first avoided the fury of the multitude,\r\nand then betook himself to prayer to God, beseeching him, that as he had\r\ngiven them food when they were in the greatest want of it, so he would\r\ngive them drink, since the favor of giving them food was of no value to\r\nthem while they had nothing to drink. And God did not long delay to give\r\nit them, but promised Moses that he would procure them a fountain, and\r\nplenty of water, from a place they did not expect any. So he commanded\r\nhim to smite the rock which they saw lying there, 5 with his rod, and\r\nout of it to receive plenty of what they wanted; for he had taken care\r\nthat drink should come to them without any labor or pains-taking. When\r\nMoses had received this command from God, he came to the people, who\r\nwaited for him, and looked upon him, for they saw already that he was\r\ncoming apace from his eminence. As soon as he was come, he told them\r\nthat God would deliver them from their present distress, and had granted\r\nthem an unexpected favor; and informed them, that a river should run for\r\ntheir sakes out of the rock. But they were amazed at that hearing,\r\nsupposing they were of necessity to cut the rock in pieces, now they\r\nwere distressed by their thirst and by their journey; while Moses only\r\nsmiting the rock with his rod, opened a passage, and out of it burst\r\nwater, and that in great abundance, and very clear. But they were\r\nastonished at this wonderful effect; and, as it were, quenched their\r\nthirst by the very sight of it. So they drank this pleasant, this sweet\r\nwater; and such it seemed to be, as might well be expected where God was\r\nthe donor. They were also in admiration how Moses was honored by God;\r\nand they made grateful returns of sacrifices to God for his providence\r\ntowards them. Now that Scripture, which is laid up in the temple, 6\r\ninforms us, how God foretold to Moses, that water timid in this manner\r\nbe derived out of the rock.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How The Amalekites And The Neighbouring Nations, Made War\r\nWith The Hebrews And Were Beaten And Lost A Great Part Of Their Army.\r\n\r\n1. The name of the Hebrews began already to be every where renowned, and\r\nrumors about them ran abroad. This made the inhabitants of those\r\ncountries to be in no small fear. Accordingly they sent ambassadors to\r\none another, and exhorted one another to defend themselves, and to\r\nendeavor to destroy these men. Those that induced the rest to do so,\r\nwere such as inhabited Gobolitis and Petra. They were called Amalekites,\r\nand were the most warlike of the nations that lived thereabout; and\r\nwhose kings exhorted one another, and their neighbors, to go to this war\r\nagainst the Hebrews; telling them that an army of strangers, and such a\r\none as had run away from slavery under the Egyptians, lay in wait to\r\nruin them; which army they were not, in common prudence and regard to\r\ntheir own safety, to overlook, but to crush them before they gather\r\nstrength, and come to be in prosperity: and perhaps attack them first in\r\na hostile manner, as presuming upon our indolence in not attacking them\r\nbefore; and that we ought to avenge ourselves of them for what they have\r\ndone in the wilderness, but that this cannot be so well done when they\r\nhave once laid their hands on our cities and our goods: that those who\r\nendeavor to crush a power in its first rise, are wiser than those that\r\nendeavor to put a stop to its progress when it is become formidable; for\r\nthese last seem to be angry only at the flourishing of others, but the\r\nformer do not leave any room for their enemies to become troublesome to\r\nthem. After they had sent such embassages to the neighboring nations,\r\nand among one another, they resolved to attack the Hebrews in battle.\r\n\r\n2. These proceedings of the people of those countries occasioned\r\nperplexity and trouble to Moses, who expected no such warlike\r\npreparations. And when these nations were ready to fight, and the\r\nmultitude of the Hebrews were obliged to try the fortune of war, they\r\nwere in a mighty disorder, and in want of all necessaries, and yet were\r\nto make war with men who were thoroughly well prepared for it. Then\r\ntherefore it was that Moses began to encourage them, and to exhort them\r\nto have a good heart, and rely on God's assistance by which they had\r\nbeen put in a state of freedom and to hope for victory over those who\r\nwere ready to fight with them, in order to deprive them of that\r\nblessing: that they were to suppose their own army to be numerous,\r\nwanting nothing, neither weapons, nor money, nor provisions, nor such\r\nother conveniences as, when men are in possession of, they fight\r\nundauntedly; and that they are to judge themselves to have all these\r\nadvantages in the Divine assistance. They are also to suppose the\r\nenemy's army to be small, unarmed, weak, and such as want those\r\nconveniences which they know must be wanted, when it is God's will that\r\nthey shall be beaten; and how valuable God's assistance is, they had\r\nexperienced in abundance of trials; and those such as were more terrible\r\nthan war, for that is only against men; but these were against famine\r\nand thirst, things indeed that are in their own nature insuperable; as\r\nalso against mountains, and that sea which afforded them no way for\r\nescaping; yet had all these difficulties been conquered by God's\r\ngracious kindness to them. So he exhorted them to be courageous at this\r\ntime, and to look upon their entire prosperity to depend on the present\r\nconquest of their enemies.\r\n\r\n3. And with these words did Moses encourage the multitude, who then\r\ncalled together the princes of their tribes, and their chief men, both\r\nseparately and conjointly. The young men he charged to obey their\r\nelders, and the elders to hearken to their leader. So the people were\r\nelevated in their minds, and ready to try their fortune in battle, and\r\nhoped to be thereby at length delivered from all their miseries: nay,\r\nthey desired that Moses would immediately lead them against their\r\nenemies without the least delay, that no backwardness might be a\r\nhindrance to their present resolution. So Moses sorted all that were fit\r\nfor war into different troops, and set Joshua, the son of Nun, of the\r\ntribe of Ephraim, over them; one that was of great courage, and patient\r\nto undergo labors; of great abilities to understand, and to speak what\r\nwas proper; and very serious in the worship of God; and indeed made like\r\nanother Moses, a teacher of piety towards God. He also appointed a small\r\nparty of the armed men to be near the water, and to take care of the\r\nchildren, and the women, and of the entire camp. So that whole night\r\nthey prepared themselves for the battle; they took their weapons, if any\r\nof them had such as were well made, and attended to their commanders as\r\nready to rush forth to the battle as soon as Moses should give the word\r\nof command. Moses also kept awake, teaching Joshua after what manner he\r\nshould order his camp. But when the day began, Moses called for Joshua\r\nagain, and exhorted him to approve himself in deeds such a one as a his\r\nreputation made men expect from him; and to gain glory by the present\r\nexpedition, in the opinion of those under him, for his exploits in this\r\nbattle. He also gave a particular exhortation to the principal men of\r\nthe Hebrews, and encouraged the whole army as it stood armed before him.\r\nAnd when he had thus animated the army, both by his words and works, and\r\nprepared every thing, he retired to a mountain, and committed the army\r\nto God and to Joshua.\r\n\r\n4. So the armies joined battle; and it came to a close fight, hand to\r\nhand, both sides showing great alacrity, and encouraging one another.\r\nAnd indeed while Moses stretched out his hand towards heaven 7 the\r\nHebrews were too hard for the Amalekites: but Moses not being able to\r\nsustain his hands thus stretched out, [for as often as he let down his\r\nhands, so often were his own people worsted,] he bade his brother Aaron,\r\nand Hur their sister Miriam's husband, to stand on each side of him, and\r\ntake hold of his hands, and not permit his weariness to prevent it, but\r\nto assist him in the extension of his hands. When this was done, the\r\nHebrews conquered the Amalekites by main force; and indeed they had all\r\nperished, unless the approach of the night had obliged the Hebrews to\r\ndesist from killing any more. So our forefathers obtained a most signal\r\nand most seasonable victory; for they not only overcame those that\r\nfought against them, but terrified also the neighboring nations, and got\r\ngreat and splendid advantages, which they obtained of their enemies by\r\ntheir hard pains in this battle: for when they had taken the enemy's\r\ncamp, they got ready booty for the public, and for their own private\r\nfamilies, whereas till then they had not any sort of plenty, of even\r\nnecessary food. The forementioned battle, when they had once got it, was\r\nalso the occasion of their prosperity, not only for the present, but for\r\nthe future ages also; for they not only made slaves of the bodies of\r\ntheir enemies, but subdued their minds also, and after this battle,\r\nbecame terrible to all that dwelt round about them. Moreover, they\r\nacquired a vast quantity of riches; for a great deal of silver and gold\r\nwas left in the enemy's camp; as also brazen vessels, which they made\r\ncommon use of in their families; many utensils also that were\r\nembroidered there were of both sorts, that is, of what were weaved, and\r\nwhat were the ornaments of their armor, and other things that served for\r\nuse in the family, and for the furniture of their rooms; they got also\r\nthe prey of their cattle, and of whatsoever uses to follow camps, when\r\nthey remove from one place to another. So the Hebrews now valued\r\nthemselves upon their courage, and claimed great merit for their valor;\r\nand they perpetually inured themselves to take pains, by which they\r\ndeemed every difficulty might be surmounted. Such were the consequences\r\nof this battle.\r\n\r\n5. On the next day, Moses stripped the dead bodies of their enemies, and\r\ngathered together the armor of those that were fled, and gave rewards to\r\nsuch as had signalized themselves in the action; and highly commended\r\nJoshua, their general, who was attested to by all the army, on account\r\nof the great actions he had done. Nor was any one of the Hebrews slain;\r\nbut the slain of the enemy's army were too many to be enumerated. So\r\nMoses offered sacrifices of thanksgiving to God, and built an altar,\r\nwhich he named The Lord the Conqueror. He also foretold that the\r\nAmalekites should utterly be destroyed; and that hereafter none of them\r\nshould remain, because they fought against the Hebrews, and this when\r\nthey were in the wilderness, and in their distress also. Moreover, he\r\nrefreshed the army with feasting. And thus did they fight this first\r\nbattle with those that ventured to oppose them, after they were gone out\r\nof Egypt. But when Moses had celebrated this festival for the victory,\r\nhe permitted the Hebrews to rest for a few days, and then he brought\r\nthem out after the fight, in order of battle; for they had now many\r\nsoldiers in light armor. And going gradually on, he came to Mount Sinai,\r\nin three months' time after they were removed out of Egypt; at which\r\nmountain, as we have before related, the vision of the bush, and the\r\nother wonderful appearances, had happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. That Moses Kindly Received-His Father-In-Law, Jethro, When He\r\nCame To Him To Mount Sinai.\r\n\r\nNow when Raguel, Moses's father-in-law, understood in what a prosperous\r\ncondition his affairs were, he willingly came to meet him and Moses and\r\nhis children, and pleased himself with his coming. And when he had\r\noffered sacrifice, he made a feast for the multitude, near the Bush he\r\nhad formerly seen; which multitude, every one according to their\r\nfamilies, partook of the feast. But Aaron and his family took Raguel,\r\nand sung hymns to God, as to Him who had been the author procurer of\r\ntheir deliverance and their freedom. They also praised their conductor,\r\nas him by whose virtue it was that all things had succeeded with them.\r\nRaguel also, in his eucharistical oration to Moses, made great encomiums\r\nupon the whole multitude; and he could not but admire Moses for his\r\nfortitude, and that humanity he had shewn in the delivery of his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How Raguel Suggested To Moses To Set His People In Order,\r\nUnder Their Rulers Of Thousands, And Rulers Of Hundreds, Who Lived\r\nWithout Order Before; And How Moses Complied In All Things With His\r\nFather-In-Law's Admonition.\r\n\r\n1. The next day, as Raguel saw Moses in the middle of a crowd of\r\nbusiness for he determined the differences of those that referred them\r\nto him, every one still going to him, and supposing that they should\r\nthen only obtain justice, if he were the arbitrator; and those that lost\r\ntheir causes thought it no harm, while they thought they lost them\r\njustly, and not by partiality. Raguel however said nothing to him at\r\nthat time, as not desirous to be any hinderance to such as had a mind to\r\nmake use of the virtue of their conductor. But afterward he took him to\r\nhimself, and when he had him alone, he instructed him in what he ought\r\nto do; and advised him to leave the trouble of lesser causes to others,\r\nbut himself to take care of the greater, and of the people's safety, for\r\nthat certain others of the Hebrews might be found that were fit to\r\ndetermine causes, but that nobody but a Moses could take of the safety\r\nof so many ten thousands. \"Be therefore,\" says he, \"insensible of thine\r\nown virtue, and what thou hast done by ministering under God to the\r\npeople's preservation. Permit, therefore, the determination of common\r\ncauses to be done by others, but do thou reserve thyself to the\r\nattendance on God only, and look out for methods of preserving the\r\nmultitude from their present distress. Make use of the method I suggest\r\nto you, as to human affairs; and take a review of the army, and appoint\r\nchosen rulers over tens of thousands, and then over thousands; then\r\ndivide them into five hundreds, and again into hundreds, and into\r\nfifties; and set rulers over each of them, who may distinguish them into\r\nthirties, and keep them in order; and at last number them by twenties\r\nand by tens: and let there be one commander over each number, to be\r\ndenominated from the number of those over whom they are rulers, but such\r\nas the whole multitude have tried, and do approve of, as being good and\r\nrighteous men; 8 and let those rulers decide the controversies they have\r\none with another. But if any great cause arise, let them bring the\r\ncognizance of it before the rulers of a higher dignity; but if any great\r\ndifficulty arise that is too hard for even their determination, let them\r\nsend it to thee. By these means two advantages will be gained; the\r\nHebrews will have justice done them, and thou wilt be able to attend\r\nconstantly on God, and procure him to be more favorable to the people.\"\r\n\r\n2. This was the admonition of Raguel; and Moses received his advice very\r\nkindly, and acted according to his suggestion. Nor did he conceal the\r\ninvention of this method, nor pretend to it himself, but informed the\r\nmultitude who it was that invented it: nay, he has named Raguel in the\r\nbooks he wrote, as the person who invented this ordering of the people,\r\nas thinking it right to give a true testimony to worthy persons,\r\nalthough he might have gotten reputation by ascribing to himself the\r\ninventions of other men; whence we may learn the virtuous disposition of\r\nMoses: but of such his disposition, we shall have proper occasion to\r\nspeak in other places of these books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How Moses Ascended Up To Mount Sinai, And Received Laws From\r\nGod, And Delivered Them To The Hebrews.\r\n\r\n1. Now Moses called the multitude together, and told them that he was\r\ngoing from them unto mount Sinai to converse with God; to receive from\r\nhim, and to bring back with him, a certain oracle; but he enjoined them\r\nto pitch their tents near the mountain, and prefer the habitation that\r\nwas nearest to God, before one more remote. When he had said this, he\r\nascended up to Mount Sinai, which is the highest of all the mountains\r\nthat are in that country 9 and is not only very difficult to be ascended\r\nby men, on account of its vast altitude, but because of the sharpness of\r\nits precipices also; nay, indeed, it cannot be looked at without pain of\r\nthe eyes: and besides this, it was terrible and inaccessible, on account\r\nof the rumor that passed about, that God dwelt there. But the Hebrews\r\nremoved their tents as Moses had bidden them, and took possession of the\r\nlowest parts of the mountain; and were elevated in their minds, in\r\nexpectation that Moses would return from God with promises of the good\r\nthings he had proposed to them. So they feasted and waited for their\r\nconductor, and kept themselves pure as in other respects, and not\r\naccompanying with their wives for three days, as he had before ordered\r\nthem to do. And they prayed to God that he would favorably receive Moses\r\nin his conversing with him, and bestow some such gift upon them by which\r\nthey might live well. They also lived more plentifully as to their diet;\r\nand put on their wives and children more ornamental and decent clothing\r\nthan they usually wore.\r\n\r\n2. So they passed two days in this way of feasting; but on the third\r\nday, before the sun was up, a cloud spread itself over the whole camp of\r\nthe Hebrews, such a one as none had before seen, and encompassed the\r\nplace where they had pitched their tents; and while all the rest of the\r\nair was clear, there came strong winds, that raised up large showers of\r\nrain, which became a mighty tempest. There was also such lightning, as\r\nwas terrible to those that saw it; and thunder, with its thunderbolts,\r\nwere sent down, and declared God to be there present in a gracious way\r\nto such as Moses desired he should be gracious. Now, as to these\r\nmatters, every one of my readers may think as he pleases; but I am under\r\na necessity of relating this history as it is described in the sacred\r\nbooks. This sight, and the amazing sound that came to their ears,\r\ndisturbed the Hebrews to a prodigious degree, for they were not such as\r\nthey were accustomed to; and then the rumor that was spread abroad, how\r\nGod frequented that mountain, greatly astonished their minds, so they\r\nsorrowfully contained themselves within their tents, as both supposing\r\nMoses to be destroyed by the Divine wrath, and expecting the like\r\ndestruction for themselves.\r\n\r\n3. When they were under these apprehensions, Moses appeared as joyful\r\nand greatly exalted. When they saw him, they were freed from their fear,\r\nand admitted of more comfortable hopes as to what was to come. The air\r\nalso was become clear and pure of its former disorders, upon the\r\nappearance of Moses; whereupon he called together the people to a\r\ncongregation, in order to their hearing what God would say to them: and\r\nwhen they were gathered together, he stood on an eminence whence they\r\nmight all hear him, and said, \"God has received me graciously, O\r\nHebrews, as he has formerly done; and has suggested a happy method of\r\nliving for you, and an order of political government, and is now present\r\nin the camp: I therefore charge you, for his sake and the sake of his\r\nworks, and what we have done by his means, that you do not put a low\r\nvalue on what I am going to say, because the commands have been given by\r\nme that now deliver them to you, nor because it is the tongue of a man\r\nthat delivers them to you; but if you have a due regard to the great\r\nimportance of the things themselves, you will understand the greatness\r\nof Him whose institutions they are, and who has not disdained to\r\ncommunicate them to me for our common advantage; for it is not to be\r\nsupposed that the author of these institutions is barely Moses, the son\r\nof Amram and Jochebed, but He who obliged the Nile to run bloody for\r\nyour sakes, and tamed the haughtiness of the Egyptians by various sorts\r\nof judgments; he who provided a way through the sea for us; he who\r\ncontrived a method of sending us food from heaven, when we were\r\ndistressed for want of it; he who made the water to issue out of a rock,\r\nwhen we had very little of it before; he by whose means Adam was made to\r\npartake of the fruits both of the land and of the sea; he by whose means\r\nNoah escaped the deluge; he by whose means our forefather Abraham, of a\r\nwandering pilgrim, was made the heir of the land of Canaan; he by whose\r\nmeans Isaac was born of parents that were very old; he by whose means\r\nJacob was adorned with twelve virtuous sons; he by whose means Joseph\r\nbecame a potent lord over the Egyptians; he it is who conveys these\r\ninstructions to you by me as his interpreter. And let them be to you\r\nvenerable, and contended for more earnestly by you than your own\r\nchildren and your own wives; for if you will follow them, you will lead\r\na happy life you will enjoy the land fruitful, the sea calm, and the\r\nfruit of the womb born complete, as nature requires; you will be also\r\nterrible to your enemies for I have been admitted into the presence of\r\nGod and been made a hearer of his incorruptible voice so great is his\r\nconcern for your nation, and its duration.\"\r\n\r\n4. When he had said this, he brought the people, with their wives and\r\nchildren, so near the mountain, that they might hear God himself\r\nspeaking to them about the precepts which they were to practice; that\r\nthe energy of what should be spoken might not be hurt by its utterance\r\nby that tongue of a man, which could but imperfectly deliver it to their\r\nunderstanding. And they all heard a voice that came to all of them from\r\nabove, insomuch that no one of these words escaped them, which Moses\r\nwrote on two tables; which it is not lawful for us to set down directly,\r\nbut their import we will declare 10\r\n\r\n5. The first commandment teaches us that there is but one God, and that\r\nwe ought to worship him only. The second commands us not to make the\r\nimage of any living creature to worship it. The third, that we must not\r\nswear by God in a false matter. The fourth, that we must keep the\r\nseventh day, by resting from all sorts of work. The fifth, that we must\r\nhonor our parents. The sixth that we must abstain from murder. The\r\nseventh that we must not commit adultery. The eighth, that we must not\r\nbe guilty of theft. The ninth, that we must not bear false witness. The\r\ntenth, that we must not admit of the desire of any thing that is\r\nanother's.\r\n\r\n6. Now when the multitude had heard God himself giving those precepts\r\nwhich Moses had discoursed of, they rejoiced at what was said; and the\r\ncongregation was dissolved: but on the following days they came to his\r\ntent, and desired him to bring them, besides, other laws from God.\r\nAccordingly he appointed such laws, and afterwards informed them in what\r\nmanner they should act in all cases; which laws I shall make mention of\r\nin their proper time; but I shall reserve most of those laws for another\r\nwork, 11 and make there a distinct explication of them.\r\n\r\n7. When matters were brought to this state, Moses went up again to Mount\r\nSinai, of which he had told them beforehand. He made his ascent in their\r\nsight; and while he staid there so long a time, [for he was absent from\r\nthem forty days,] fear seized upon the Hebrews, lest Moses should have\r\ncome to any harm; nor was there any thing else so sad, and that so much\r\ntroubled them, as this supposal that Moses was perished. Now there was a\r\nvariety in their sentiments about it; some saying that he was fallen\r\namong wild beasts; and those that were of this opinion were chiefly such\r\nas were ill-disposed to him; but others said that he was departed, and\r\ngone to God; but the wiser sort were led by their reason to embrace\r\nneither of those opinions with any satisfaction, thinking, that as it\r\nwas a thing that sometimes happens to men to fall among wild beasts and\r\nperish that way, so it was probable enough that he might depart and go\r\nto God, on account of his virtue; they therefore were quiet, and\r\nexpected the event: yet were they exceeding sorry upon the supposal that\r\nthey were deprived of a governor and a protector, such a one indeed as\r\nthey could never recover again; nor would this suspicion give them leave\r\nto expect any comfortable event about this man, nor could they prevent\r\ntheir trouble and melancholy upon this occasion. However, the camp durst\r\nnot remove all this while, because Moses had bidden them afore to stay\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n8. But when the forty days, and as many nights, were over, Moses came\r\ndown, having tasted nothing of food usually appointed for the\r\nnourishment of men. His appearance filled the army with gladness, and he\r\ndeclared to them what care God had of them, and by what manner of\r\nconduct of their lives they might live happily; telling them, that\r\nduring these days of his absence he had suggested to him also that he\r\nwould have a tabernacle built for him, into which he would descend when\r\nhe came to them, and how we should carry it about with us when we remove\r\nfrom this place; and that there would be no longer any occasion for\r\ngoing up to Mount Sinai, but that he would himself come and pitch his\r\ntabernacle amongst us, and be present at our prayers; as also, that the\r\ntabernacle should be of such measures and construction as he had shown\r\nhim, and that you are to fall to the work, and prosecute it diligently.\r\nWhen he had said this, he showed them the two tables, with the ten\r\ncommandments engraven upon them, five upon each table; and the writing\r\nwas by the hand of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. Concerning The Tabernacle Which Moses Built In The Wilderness\r\nFor The Honor Of God And Which Seemed To Be A Temple.\r\n\r\n1. Hereupon the Israelites rejoiced at what they had seen and heard of\r\ntheir conductor, and were not wanting in diligence according to their\r\nability; for they brought silver, and gold, and brass, and of the best\r\nsorts of wood, and such as would not at all decay by putrefaction;\r\ncamels' hair also, and sheep-skins, some of them dyed of a blue color,\r\nand some of a scarlet; some brought the flower for the purple color, and\r\nothers for white, with wool dyed by the flowers aforementioned; and fine\r\nlinen and precious stones, which those that use costly ornaments set in\r\nouches of gold; they brought also a great quantity of spices; for of\r\nthese materials did Moses build the tabernacle, which did not at all\r\ndiffer from a movable and ambulatory temple. Now when these things were\r\nbrought together with great diligence, [for every one was ambitious to\r\nfurther the work even beyond their ability,] he set architects over the\r\nworks, and this by the command of God; and indeed the very same which\r\nthe people themselves would have chosen, had the election been allowed\r\nto them. Now their names are set down in writing in the sacred books;\r\nand they were these: Besaleel, the son of Uri, of the tribe of Judah,\r\nthe grandson of Miriam, the sister of their conductor and Aholiab, the\r\nson of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. Now the people went on with what\r\nthey had undertaken with so great alacrity, that Moses was obliged to\r\nrestrain them, by making proclamation, that what had been brought was\r\nsufficient, as the artificers had informed him; so they fell to work\r\nupon the building of the tabernacle. Moses also informed them, according\r\nto the direction of God, both what the measures were to be, and its\r\nlargeness; and how many vessels it ought to contain for the use of the\r\nsacrifices. The women also were ambitious to do their parts, about the\r\ngarments of the priests, and about other things that would be wanted in\r\nthis work, both for ornament and for the divine service itself.\r\n\r\n2. Now when all things were prepared, the gold, and the silver, and the\r\nbrass, and what was woven, Moses, when he had appointed beforehand that\r\nthere should be a festival, and that sacrifices should be offered\r\naccording to every one's ability, reared up the tabernacle 12 and when\r\nhe had measured the open court, fifty cubits broad and a hundred long,\r\nhe set up brazen pillars, five cubits high, twenty on each of the longer\r\nsides, and ten pillars for the breadth behind; every one of the pillars\r\nalso had a ring. Their chapiters were of silver, but their bases were of\r\nbrass: they resembled the sharp ends of spears, and were of brass, fixed\r\ninto the ground. Cords were also put through the rings, and were tied at\r\ntheir farther ends to brass nails of a cubit long, which, at every\r\npillar, were driven into the floor, and would keep the tabernacle from\r\nbeing shaken by the violence of winds; but a curtain of fine soft linen\r\nwent round all the pillars, and hung down in a flowing and loose manner\r\nfrom their chapiters, and enclosed the whole space, and seemed not at\r\nall unlike to a wall about it. And this was the structure of three of\r\nthe sides of this enclosure; but as for the fourth side, which was fifty\r\ncubits in extent, and was the front of the whole, twenty cubits of it\r\nwere for the opening of the gates, wherein stood two pillars on each\r\nside, after the resemblance of open gates. These were made wholly of\r\nsilver, and polished, and that all over, excepting the bases, which were\r\nof brass. Now on each side of the gates there stood three pillars, which\r\nwere inserted into the concave bases of the gates, and were suited to\r\nthem; and round them was drawn a curtain of fine linen; but to the gates\r\nthemselves, which were twenty cubits in extent, and five in height, the\r\ncurtain was composed of purple, and scarlet, and blue, and fine linen,\r\nand embroidered with many and divers sorts of figures, excepting the\r\nfigures of animals. Within these gates was the brazen laver for\r\npurification, having a basin beneath of the like matter, whence the\r\npriests might wash their hands and sprinkle their feet; and this was the\r\nornamental construction of the enclosure about the court of the\r\ntabernacle, which was exposed to the open air.\r\n\r\n3. As to the tabernacle itself, Moses placed it in the middle of that\r\ncourt, with its front to the east, that, when the sun arose, it might\r\nsend its first rays upon it. Its length, when it was set up, was thirty\r\ncubits, and its breadth was twelve [ten] cubits. The one of its walls\r\nwas on the south, and the other was exposed to the north, and on the\r\nback part of it remained the west. It was necessary that its height\r\nshould be equal to its breadth [ten cubits]. There were also pillars\r\nmade of wood, twenty on each side; they were wrought into a quadrangular\r\nfigure, in breadth a cubit and a half, but the thickness was four\r\nfingers: they had thin plates of gold affixed to them on both sides,\r\ninwardly and outwardly: they had each of them two tenons belonging to\r\nthem, inserted into their bases, and these were of silver, in each of\r\nwhich bases there was a socket to receive the tenon; but the pillars on\r\nthe west wall were six. Now all these tenons and sockets accurately\r\nfitted one another, insomuch that the joints were invisible, and both\r\nseemed to be one entire and united wall. It was also covered with gold,\r\nboth within and without. The number of pillars was equal on the opposite\r\nsides, and there were on each part twenty, and every one of them had the\r\nthird part of a span in thickness; so that the number of thirty cubits\r\nwere fully made up between them; but as to the wall behind, where the\r\nsix pillars made up together only nine cubits, they made two other\r\npillars, and cut them out of one cubit, which they placed in the\r\ncorners, and made them equally fine with the other. Now every one of the\r\npillars had rings of gold affixed to their fronts outward, as if they\r\nhad taken root in the pillars, and stood one row over against another\r\nround about, through which were inserted bars gilt over with gold, each\r\nof them five cubits long, and these bound together the pillars, the head\r\nof one bar running into another, after the nature of one tenon inserted\r\ninto another; but for the wall behind, there was but one row of bars\r\nthat went through all the pillars, into which row ran the ends of the\r\nbars on each side of the longer walls; the male with its female being so\r\nfastened in their joints, that they held the whole firmly together; and\r\nfor this reason was all this joined so fast together, that the\r\ntabernacle might not be shaken, either by the winds, or by any other\r\nmeans, but that it might preserve itself quiet and immovable\r\ncontinually.\r\n\r\n4. As for the inside, Moses parted its length into three partitions. At\r\nthe distance of ten cubits from the most secret end, Moses placed four\r\npillars, the workmanship of which was the very same with that of the\r\nrest; and they stood upon the like bases with them, each a small matter\r\ndistant from his fellow. Now the room within those pillars was the most\r\nholy place; but the rest of the room was the tabernacle, which was open\r\nfor the priests. However, this proportion of the measures of the\r\ntabernacle proved to be an imitation of the system of the world; for\r\nthat third part thereof which was within the four pillars, to which the\r\npriests were not admitted, is, as it were, a heaven peculiar to God. But\r\nthe space of the twenty cubits, is, as it were, sea and land, on which\r\nmen live, and so this part is peculiar to the priests only. But at the\r\nfront, where the entrance was made, they placed pillars of gold, that\r\nstood on bases of brass, in number seven; but then they spread over the\r\ntabernacle veils of fine linen and purple, and blue, and scarlet colors,\r\nembroidered. The first veil was ten cubits every way, and this they\r\nspread over the pillars which parted the temple, and kept the most holy\r\nplace concealed within; and this veil was that which made this part not\r\nvisible to any. Now the whole temple was called The Holy Place: but that\r\npart which was within the four pillars, and to which none were admitted,\r\nwas called The Holy of Holies. This veil was very ornamental, and\r\nembroidered with all sorts of flowers which the earth produces; and\r\nthere were interwoven into it all sorts of variety that might be an\r\nornament, excepting the forms of animals. Another veil there was which\r\ncovered the five pillars that were at the entrance. It was like the\r\nformer in its magnitude, and texture, and color; and at the corner of\r\nevery pillar a ring retained it from the top downwards half the depth of\r\nthe pillars, the other half affording an entrance for the priests, who\r\ncrept under it. Over this there was a veil of linen, of the same\r\nlargeness with the former: it was to be drawn this way or that way by\r\ncords, the rings of which, fixed to the texture of the veil, and to the\r\ncords also, were subservient to the drawing and undrawing of the veil,\r\nand to the fastening it at the corner, that then it might be no\r\nhinderance to the view of the sanctuary, especially on solemn days; but\r\nthat on other days, and especially when the weather was inclined to\r\nsnow, it might be expanded, and afford a covering to the veil of divers\r\ncolors. Whence that custom of ours is derived, of having a fine linen\r\nveil, after the temple has been built, to be drawn over the entrances.\r\nBut the ten other curtains were four cubits in breadth, and twenty-eight\r\nin length; and had golden clasps, in order to join the one curtain to\r\nthe other, which was done so exactly that they seemed to be one entire\r\ncurtain. These were spread over the temple, and covered all the top and\r\nparts of the walls, on the sides and behind, so far as within one cubit\r\nof the ground. There were other curtains of the same breadth with these,\r\nbut one more in number, and longer, for they were thirty cubits long;\r\nbut these were woven of hair, with the like subtilty as those of wool\r\nwere made, and were extended loosely down to the ground, appearing like\r\na triangular front and elevation at the gates, the eleventh curtain\r\nbeing used for this very purpose. There were also other curtains made of\r\nskins above these, which afforded covering and protection to those that\r\nwere woven both in hot weather and when it rained. And great was the\r\nsurprise of those who viewed these curtains at a distance, for they\r\nseemed not at all to differ from the color of the sky. But those that\r\nwere made of hair and of skins, reached down in the same manner as did\r\nthe veil at the gates, and kept off the heat of the sun, and what injury\r\nthe rains might do. And after this manner was the tabernacle reared.\r\n\r\n5. There was also an ark made, sacred to God, of wood that was naturally\r\nstrong, and could not be corrupted. This was called Eron in our own\r\nlanguage. Its construction was thus: its length was five spans, but its\r\nbreadth and height was each of them three spans. It was covered all over\r\nwith gold, both within and without, so that the wooden part was not\r\nseen. It had also a cover united to it, by golden hinges, after a\r\nwonderful manner; which cover was every way evenly fitted to it, and had\r\nno eminences to hinder its exact conjunction. There were also two golden\r\nrings belonging to each of the longer boards, and passing through the\r\nentire wood, and through them gilt bars passed along each board, that it\r\nmight thereby be moved and carried about, as occasion should require;\r\nfor it was not drawn in a cart by beasts of burden, but borne on the\r\nshoulders of the priests. Upon this its cover were two images, which the\r\nHebrews call Cherubims; they are flying creatures, but their form is not\r\nlike to that of any of the creatures which men have seen, though Moses\r\nsaid he had seen such beings near the throne of God. In this ark he put\r\nthe two tables whereon the ten commandments were written, five upon each\r\ntable, and two and a half upon each side of them; and this ark he placed\r\nin the most holy place.\r\n\r\n6. But in the holy place he placed a table, like those at Delphi. Its\r\nlength was two cubits, and its breadth one cubit, and its height three\r\nspans. It had feet also, the lower half of which were complete feet,\r\nresembling those which the Dorians put to their bedsteads; but the upper\r\nparts towards the table were wrought into a square form. The table had a\r\nhollow towards every side, having a ledge of four fingers' depth, that\r\nwent round about like a spiral, both on the upper and lower part of the\r\nbody of the work. Upon every one of the feet was there also inserted a\r\nring, not far from the cover, through which went bars of wood beneath,\r\nbut gilded, to be taken out upon occasion, there being a cavity where it\r\nwas joined to the rings; for they were not entire rings; but before they\r\ncame quite round they ended in acute points, the one of which was\r\ninserted into the prominent part of the table, and the other into the\r\nfoot; and by these it was carried when they journeyed: Upon this table,\r\nwhich was placed on the north side of the temple, not far from the most\r\nholy place, were laid twelve unleavened loaves of bread, six upon each\r\nheap, one above another: they were made of two tenth-deals of the purest\r\nflour, which tenth-deal [an omer] is a measure of the Hebrews,\r\ncontaining seven Athenian cotyloe; and above those loaves were put two\r\nvials full of frankincense. Now after seven days other loaves were\r\nbrought in their stead, on the day which is by us called the Sabbath;\r\nfor we call the seventh day the Sabbath. But for the occasion of this\r\nintention of placing loaves here, we will speak to it in another place.\r\n\r\n7. Over against this table, near the southern wall, was set a\r\ncandlestick of cast gold, hollow within, being of the weight of one\r\nhundred pounds, which the Hebrews call Chinchares, if it be turned into\r\nthe Greek language, it denotes a talent. It was made with its knops, and\r\nlilies, and pomegranates, and bowls [which ornaments amounted to seventy\r\nin all]; by which means the shaft elevated itself on high from a single\r\nbase, and spread itself into as many branches as there are planets,\r\nincluding the sun among them. It terminated in seven heads, in one row,\r\nall standing parallel to one another; and these branches carried seven\r\nlamps, one by one, in imitation of the number of the planets. These\r\nlamps looked to the east and to the south, the candlestick being situate\r\nobliquely.\r\n\r\n8. Now between this candlestick and the table, which, as we said, were\r\nwithin the sanctuary, was the altar of incense, made of wood indeed, but\r\nof the same wood of which the foregoing vessels were made, such as was\r\nnot liable to corruption; it was entirely crusted over with a golden\r\nplate. Its breadth on each side was a cubit, but the altitude double.\r\nUpon it was a grate of gold, that was extant above the altar, which had\r\na golden crown encompassing it round about, whereto belonged rings and\r\nbars, by which the priests carried it when they journeyed. Before this\r\ntabernacle there was reared a brazen altar, but it was within made of\r\nwood, five cubits by measure on each side, but its height was but three,\r\nin like manner adorned with brass plates as bright as gold. It had also\r\na brazen hearth of network; for the ground underneath received the fire\r\nfrom the hearth, because it had no basis to receive it. Hard by this\r\naltar lay the basins, and the vials, and the censers, and the caldrons,\r\nmade of gold; but the other vessels, made for the use of the sacrifices,\r\nwere all of brass. And such was the construction of the tabernacle; and\r\nthese were the vessels thereto belonging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. Concerning The Garments Of The Priests, And Of The High\r\nPriest.\r\n\r\n1. There were peculiar garments appointed for the priests, and for all\r\nthe rest, which they call Cohanoeoe [-priestly] garments, as also for\r\nthe high priests, which they call Cahanoeoe Rabbae, and denote the high\r\npriest's garments. Such was therefore the habit of the rest. But when\r\nthe priest approaches the sacrifices, he purifies himself with the\r\npurification which the law prescribes; and, in the first place, he puts\r\non that which is called Machanase, which means somewhat that is fast\r\ntied. It is a girdle, composed of fine twined linen, and is put about\r\nthe privy parts, the feet being to be inserted into them in the nature\r\nof breeches, but above half of it is cut off, and it ends at the thighs,\r\nand is there tied fast.\r\n\r\n2. Over this he wore a linen vestment, made of fine flax doubled: it is\r\ncalled Chethone, and denotes linen, for we call linen by the name of\r\nChethone. This vestment reaches down to the feet, and sits close to the\r\nbody; and has sleeves that are tied fast to the arms: it is girded to\r\nthe breast a little above the elbows, by a girdle often going round,\r\nfour fingers broad, but so loosely woven, that you would think it were\r\nthe skin of a serpent. It is embroidered with flowers of scarlet, and\r\npurple, and blue, and fine twined linen, but the warp was nothing but\r\nfine linen. The beginning of its circumvolution is at the breast; and\r\nwhen it has gone often round, it is there tied, and hangs loosely there\r\ndown to the ankles: I mean this, all the time the priest is not about\r\nany laborious service, for in this position it appears in the most\r\nagreeable manner to the spectators; but when he is obliged to assist at\r\nthe offering sacrifices, and to do the appointed service, that he may\r\nnot be hindered in his operations by its motion, he throws it to the\r\nleft, and bears it on his shoulder. Moses indeed calls this belt\r\nAlbaneth; but we have learned from the Babylonians to call it Emia, for\r\nso it is by them called. This vestment has no loose or hollow parts any\r\nwhere in it, but only a narrow aperture about the neck; and it is tied\r\nwith certain strings hanging down from the edge over the breast and\r\nback, and is fastened above each shoulder: it is called Massabazanes.\r\n\r\n3. Upon his head he wears a cap, not brought to a conic form nor\r\nencircling the whole head, but still covering more than the half of it,\r\nwhich is called Masnaemphthes; and its make is such that it seems to be\r\na crown, being made of thick swathes, but the contexture is of linen;\r\nand it is doubled round many times, and sewed together; besides which, a\r\npiece of fine linen covers the whole cap from the upper part, and\r\nreaches down to the forehead, and hides the seams of the swathes, which\r\nwould otherwise appear indecently: this adheres closely upon the solid\r\npart of the head, and is thereto so firmly fixed, that it may not fall\r\noff during the sacred service about the sacrifices. So we have now shown\r\nyou what is the habit of the generality of the priests.\r\n\r\n4. The high priest is indeed adorned with the same garments that we have\r\ndescribed, without abating one; only over these he puts on a vestment of\r\na blue color. This also is a long robe, reaching to his feet, [in our\r\nlanguage it is called Meeir,] and is tied round with a girdle,\r\nembroidered with the same colors and flowers as the former, with a\r\nmixture of gold interwoven. To the bottom of which garment are hung\r\nfringes, in color like pomegranates, with golden bells 13 by a curious\r\nand beautiful contrivance; so that between two bells hangs a\r\npomegranate, and between two pomegranates a bell. Now this vesture was\r\nnot composed of two pieces, nor was it sewed together upon the shoulders\r\nand the sides, but it was one long vestment so woven as to have an\r\naperture for the neck; not an oblique one, but parted all along the\r\nbreast and the back. A border also was sewed to it, lest the aperture\r\nshould look too indecently: it was also parted where the hands were to\r\ncome out.\r\n\r\n5. Besides these, the high priest put on a third garment, which was\r\ncalled the Ephod, which resembles the Epomis of the Greeks. Its make was\r\nafter this manner: it was woven to the depth of a cubit, of several\r\ncolors, with gold intermixed, and embroidered, but it left the middle of\r\nthe breast uncovered: it was made with sleeves also; nor did it appear\r\nto be at all differently made from a short coat. But in the void place\r\nof this garment there was inserted a piece of the bigness of a span,\r\nembroidered with gold, and the other colors of the ephod, and was called\r\nEssen, [the breastplate,] which in the Greek language signifies the\r\nOracle. This piece exactly filled up the void space in the ephod. It was\r\nunited to it by golden rings at every corner, the like rings being\r\nannexed to the ephod, and a blue riband was made use of to tie them\r\ntogether by those rings; and that the space between the rings might not\r\nappear empty, they contrived to fill it up with stitches of blue\r\nribands. There were also two sardonyxes upon the ephod, at the\r\nshoulders, to fasten it in the nature of buttons, having each end\r\nrunning to the sardonyxes of gold, that they might be buttoned by them.\r\nOn these were engraven the names of the sons of Jacob, in our own\r\ncountry letters, and in our own tongue, six on each of the stones, on\r\neither side; and the elder sons' names were on the right shoulder.\r\nTwelve stones also there were upon the breast-plate, extraordinary in\r\nlargeness and beauty; and they were an ornament not to be purchased by\r\nmen, because of their immense value. These stones, however, stood in\r\nthree rows, by four in a row, and were inserted into the breastplate\r\nitself, and they were set in ouches of gold, that were themselves\r\ninserted in the breastplate, and were so made that they might not fall\r\nout. Now the first three stones were a sardonyx, a topaz, and an\r\nemerald. The second row contained a carbuncle, a jasper, and a sapphire.\r\nThe first of the third row was a ligure, then an amethyst, and the third\r\nan agate, being the ninth of the whole number. The first of the fourth\r\nrow was a chrysolite, the next was an onyx, and then a beryl, which was\r\nthe last of all. Now the names of all those sons of Jacob were engraven\r\nin these stones, whom we esteem the heads of our tribes, each stone\r\nhaving the honor of a name, in the order according to which they were\r\nborn. And whereas the rings were too weak of themselves to bear the\r\nweight of the stones, they made two other rings of a larger size, at the\r\nedge of that part of the breastplate which reached to the neck, and\r\ninserted into the very texture of the breastplate, to receive chains\r\nfinely wrought, which connected them with golden bands to the tops of\r\nthe shoulders, whose extremity turned backwards, and went into the ring,\r\non the prominent back part of the ephod; and this was for the security\r\nof the breastplate, that it might not fall out of its place. There was\r\nalso a girdle sewed to the breastplate, which was of the forementioned\r\ncolors, with gold intermixed, which, when it had gone once round, was\r\ntied again upon the seam, and hung down. There were also golden loops\r\nthat admitted its fringes at each extremity of the girdle, and included\r\nthem entirely.\r\n\r\n6. The high priest's mitre was the same that we described before, and\r\nwas wrought like that of all the other priests; above which there was\r\nanother, with swathes of blue embroidered, and round it was a golden\r\ncrown polished, of three rows, one above another; out of which arose a\r\ncup of gold, which resembled the herb which we call Saccharus; but those\r\nGreeks that are skillful in botany call it Hyoscyamus. Now, lest any one\r\nthat has seen this herb, but has not been taught its name, and is\r\nunacquainted with its nature, or, having known its name, knows not the\r\nherb when he sees it, I shall give such as these are a description of\r\nit. This herb is oftentimes in tallness above three spans, but its root\r\nis like that of a turnip [for he that should compare it thereto would\r\nnot be mistaken]; but its leaves are like the leaves of mint. Out of its\r\nbranches it sends out a calyx, cleaving to the branch; and a coat\r\nencompasses it, which it naturally puts off when it is changing, in\r\norder to produce its fruit. This calyx is of the bigness of the bone of\r\nthe little finger, but in the compass of its aperture is like a cup.\r\nThis I will further describe, for the use of those that are unacquainted\r\nwith it. Suppose a sphere be divided into two parts, round at the\r\nbottom, but having another segment that grows up to a circumference from\r\nthat bottom; suppose it become narrower by degrees, and that the cavity\r\nof that part grow decently smaller, and then gradually grow wider again\r\nat the brim, such as we see in the navel of a pomegranate, with its\r\nnotches. And indeed such a coat grows over this plant as renders it a\r\nhemisphere, and that, as one may say, turned accurately in a lathe, and\r\nhaving its notches extant above it, which, as I said, grow like a\r\npomegranate, only that they are sharp, and end in nothing but prickles.\r\nNow the fruit is preserved by this coat of the calyx, which fruit is\r\nlike the seed of the herb Sideritis: it sends out a flower that may seem\r\nto resemble that of poppy. Of this was a crown made, as far from the\r\nhinder part of the head to each of the temples; but this Ephielis, for\r\nso this calyx may be called, did not cover the forehead, but it was\r\ncovered with a golden plate, 14 which had inscribed upon it the name of\r\nGod in sacred characters. And such were the ornaments of the high\r\npriest.\r\n\r\n7. Now here one may wonder at the ill-will which men bear to us, and\r\nwhich they profess to bear on account of our despising that Deity which\r\nthey pretend to honor; for if any one do but consider the fabric of the\r\ntabernacle, and take a view of the garments of the high priest, and of\r\nthose vessels which we make use of in our sacred ministration, he will\r\nfind that our legislator was a divine man, and that we are unjustly\r\nreproached by others; for if any one do without prejudice, and with\r\njudgment, look upon these things, he will find they were every one made\r\nin way of imitation and representation of the universe. When Moses\r\ndistinguished the tabernacle into three parts, 15 and allowed two of\r\nthem to the priests, as a place accessible and common, he denoted the\r\nland and the sea, these being of general access to all; but he set apart\r\nthe third division for God, because heaven is inaccessible to men. And\r\nwhen he ordered twelve loaves to be set on the table, he denoted the\r\nyear, as distinguished into so many months. By branching out the\r\ncandlestick into seventy parts, he secretly intimated the Decani, or\r\nseventy divisions of the planets; and as to the seven lamps upon the\r\ncandlesticks, they referred to the course of the planets, of which that\r\nis the number. The veils, too, which were composed of four things, they\r\ndeclared the four elements; for the fine linen was proper to signify the\r\nearth, because the flax grows out of the earth; the purple signified the\r\nsea, because that color is dyed by the blood of a sea shell-fish; the\r\nblue is fit to signify the air; and the scarlet will naturally be an\r\nindication of fire. Now the vestment of the high priest being made of\r\nlinen, signified the earth; the blue denoted the sky, being like\r\nlightning in its pomegranates, and in the noise of the bells resembling\r\nthunder. And for the ephod, it showed that God had made the universe of\r\nfour elements; and as for the gold interwoven, I suppose it related to\r\nthe splendor by which all things are enlightened. He also appointed the\r\nbreastplate to be placed in the middle of the ephod, to resemble the\r\nearth, for that has the very middle place of the world. And the girdle\r\nwhich encompassed the high priest round, signified the ocean, for that\r\ngoes round about and includes the universe. Each of the sardonyxes\r\ndeclares to us the sun and the moon; those, I mean, that were in the\r\nnature of buttons on the high priest's shoulders. And for the twelve\r\nstones, whether we understand by them the months, or whether we\r\nunderstand the like number of the signs of that circle which the Greeks\r\ncall the Zodiac, we shall not be mistaken in their meaning. And for the\r\nmitre, which was of a blue color, it seems to me to mean heaven; for how\r\notherwise could the name of God be inscribed upon it? That it was also\r\nillustrated with a crown, and that of gold also, is because of that\r\nsplendor with which God is pleased. Let this explication 16 suffice at\r\npresent, since the course of my narration will often, and on many\r\noccasions, afford me the opportunity of enlarging upon the virtue of our\r\nlegislator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. Of The Priesthood Of Aaron.\r\n\r\n1. When what has been described was brought to a conclusion, gifts not\r\nbeing yet presented, God appeared to Moses, and enjoined him to bestow\r\nthe high priesthood upon Aaron his brother, as upon him that best of\r\nthem all deserved to obtain that honor, on account of his virtue. And\r\nwhen he had gathered the multitude together, he gave them an account of\r\nAaron's virtue, and of his good-will to them, and of the dangers he had\r\nundergone for their sakes. Upon which, when they had given testimony to\r\nhim in all respects, and showed their readiness to receive him, Moses\r\nsaid to them, \"O you Israelites, this work is already brought to a\r\nconclusion, in a manner most acceptable to God, and according to our\r\nabilities. And now since you see that he is received into this\r\ntabernacle, we shall first of all stand in need of one that may\r\nofficiate for us, and may minister to the sacrifices, and to the prayers\r\nthat are to be put up for us. And indeed had the inquiry after such a\r\nperson been left to me, I should have thought myself worthy of this\r\nhonor, both because all men are naturally fond of themselves, and\r\nbecause I am conscious to myself that I have taken a great deal of pains\r\nfor your deliverance; but now God himself has determined that Aaron is\r\nworthy of this honor, and has chosen him for his priest, as knowing him\r\nto be the most righteous person among you. So that he is to put on the\r\nvestments which are consecrated to God; he is to have the care of the\r\naltars, and to make provision for the sacrifices; and he it is that must\r\nput up prayers for you to God, who will readily hear them, not only\r\nbecause he is himself solicitous for your nation, but also because he\r\nwill receive them as offered by one that he hath himself chosen to this\r\noffice.\" The Hebrews were pleased with what was said, and they gave\r\ntheir approbation to him whom God had ordained; for Aaron was of them\r\nall the most deserving of this honor, on account of his own stock and\r\ngift of prophecy, and his brother's virtue. He had at that time four\r\nsons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.17\r\n\r\n2. Now Moses commanded them to make use of all the utensils which were\r\nmore than were necessary to the structure of the tabernacle, for\r\ncovering the tabernacle itself, the candlestick, and altar of incense,\r\nand the other vessels, that they might not be at all hurt when they\r\njourneyed, either by the rain, or by the rising of the dust. And when he\r\nhad gathered the multitude together again, he ordained that they should\r\noffer half a shekel for every man, as an oblation to God; which shekel\r\nis a piece among the Hebrews, and is equal to four Athenian drachmae. 18\r\nWhereupon they readily obeyed what Moses had commanded; and the number\r\nof the offerers was six hundred and five thousand five hundred and\r\nfifty. Now this money that was brought by the men that were free, was\r\ngiven by such as were about twenty years old, but under fifty; and what\r\nwas collected was spent in the uses of the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n3. Moses now purified the tabernacle and the priests; which purification\r\nwas performed after the following manner:—He commanded them to take five\r\nhundred shekels of choice myrrh, an equal quantity of cassia, and half\r\nthe foregoing weight of cinnamon and calamus [this last is a sort of\r\nsweet spice]; to beat them small, and wet them with an hin of oil of\r\nolives [an hin is our own country measure, and contains two Athenian\r\nchoas, or congiuses]; then mix them together, and boil them, and prepare\r\nthem after the art of the apothecary, and make them into a very sweet\r\nointment; and afterward to take it to anoint and to purify the priests\r\nthemselves, and all the tabernacle, as also the sacrifices. There were\r\nalso many, and those of various kinds, of sweet spices, that belonged to\r\nthe tabernacle, and such as were of very great price, and were brought\r\nto the golden altar of incense; the nature of which I do not now\r\ndescribe, lest it should be troublesome to my readers; but incense 19\r\nwas to be offered twice a-day, both before sun-rising and at sun-\r\nsetting. They were also to keep oil already purified for the lamps;\r\nthree of which were to give light all day long, 20 upon the sacred\r\ncandlestick, before God, and the rest were to be lighted at the evening.\r\n\r\n4. Now all was finished. Besaleel and Aholiab appeared to be the most\r\nskillful of the workmen; for they invented finer works than what others\r\nhad done before them, and were of great abilities to gain notions of\r\nwhat they were formerly ignorant of; and of these, Besaleel was judged\r\nto be the best. Now the whole time they were about this work was the\r\ninterval of seven months; and after this it was that was ended the first\r\nyear since their departure out of Egypt. But at the beginning of the\r\nsecond year, on the month Xanthicus, as the Macedonians call it, but on\r\nthe month Nisan, as the Hebrews call it, on the new moon, they\r\nconsecrated the tabernacle, and all its vessels, which I have already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n5. Now God showed himself pleased with the work of the Hebrews, and did\r\nnot permit their labors to be in vain; nor did he disdain to make use of\r\nwhat they had made, but he came and sojourned with them, and pitched his\r\ntabernacle in the holy house. And in the following manner did he come to\r\nit:—The sky was clear, but there was a mist over the tabernacle only,\r\nencompassing it, but not with such a very deep and thick cloud as is\r\nseen in the winter season, nor yet in so thin a one as men might be able\r\nto discern any thing through it, but from it there dropped a sweet dew,\r\nand such a one as showed the presence of God to those that desired and\r\nbelieved it.\r\n\r\n6. Now when Moses had bestowed such honorary presents on the workmen, as\r\nit was fit they should receive, who had wrought so well, he offered\r\nsacrifices in the open court of the tabernacle, as God commanded him; a\r\nbull, a ram, and a kid of the goats, for a sin-offering. Now I shall\r\nspeak of what we do in our sacred offices in my discourse about\r\nsacrifices; and therein shall inform men in what cases Moses bid us\r\noffer a whole burnt-offering, and in what cases the law permits us to\r\npartake of them as of food. And when Moses had sprinkled Aaron's\r\nvestments, himself, and his sons, with the blood of the beasts that were\r\nslain, and had purified them with spring waters and ointment, they\r\nbecame God's priests. After this manner did he consecrate them and their\r\ngarments for seven days together. The same he did to the tabernacle, and\r\nthe vessels thereto belonging, both with oil first incensed, as I said,\r\nand with the blood of bulls and of rams, slain day by day one, according\r\nto its kind. But on the eighth day he appointed a feast for the people,\r\nand commanded them to offer sacrifice according to their ability.\r\nAccordingly they contended one with another, and were ambitious to\r\nexceed each other in the sacrifices which they brought, and so fulfilled\r\nMoses's injunctions. But as the sacrifices lay upon the altar, a sudden\r\nfire was kindled from among them of its own accord, and appeared to the\r\nsight like fire from a flash of lightning, and consumed whatsoever was\r\nupon the altar.\r\n\r\n7. Hereupon an affliction befell Aaron, considered as a man and a\r\nfather, but was undergone by him with true fortitude; for he had indeed\r\na firmness of soul in such accidents, and he thought this calamity came\r\nupon him according to God's will: for whereas he had four sons, as I\r\nsaid before, the two elder of them, Nadab and Abihu, did not bring those\r\nsacrifices which Moses bade them bring, but which they used to offer\r\nformerly, and were burnt to death. Now when the fire rushed upon them,\r\nand began to burn them, nobody could quench it. Accordingly they died in\r\nthis manner. And Moses bid their father and their brethren to take up\r\ntheir bodies, to carry them out of the camp, and to bury them\r\nmagnificently. Now the multitude lamented them, and were deeply affected\r\nat this their death, which so unexpectedly befell them. But Moses\r\nentreated their brethren and their father not to be troubled for them,\r\nand to prefer the honor of God before their grief about them; for Aaron\r\nhad already put on his sacred garments.\r\n\r\n8. But Moses refused all that honor which he saw the multitude ready to\r\nbestow upon him, and attended to nothing else but the service of God. He\r\nwent no more up to Mount Sinai; but he went into the tabernacle, and\r\nbrought back answers from God for what he prayed for. His habit was also\r\nthat of a private man, and in all other circumstances he behaved himself\r\nlike one of the common people, and was desirous to appear without\r\ndistinguishing himself from the multitude, but would have it known that\r\nhe did nothing else but take care of them. He also set down in writing\r\nthe form of their government, and those laws by obedience whereto they\r\nwould lead their lives so as to please God, and so as to have no\r\nquarrels one among another. However, the laws he ordained were such as\r\nGod suggested to him; so I shall now discourse concerning that form of\r\ngovernment, and those laws.\r\n\r\n9. I will now treat of what I before omitted, the garment of the high\r\npriest: for he [Moses] left no room for the evil practices of [false]\r\nprophets; but if some of that sort should attempt to abuse the Divine\r\nauthority, he left it to God to be present at his sacrifices when he\r\npleased, and when he pleased to be absent. 21 And he was willing this\r\nshould be known, not to the Hebrews only, but to those foreigners also\r\nwho were there. For as to those stones, 22 which we told you before, the\r\nhigh priest bare on his shoulders, which were sardonyxes, [and I think\r\nit needless to describe their nature, they being known to every body,]\r\nthe one of them shined out when God was present at their sacrifices; I\r\nmean that which was in the nature of a button on his right shoulder,\r\nbright rays darting out thence, and being seen even by those that were\r\nmost remote; which splendor yet was not before natural to the stone.\r\nThis has appeared a wonderful thing to such as have not so far indulged\r\nthemselves in philosophy, as to despise Divine revelation. Yet will I\r\nmention what is still more wonderful than this: for God declared\r\nbeforehand, by those twelve stones which the high priest bare on his\r\nbreast, and which were inserted into his breastplate, when they should\r\nbe victorious in battle; for so great a splendor shone forth from them\r\nbefore the army began to march, that all the people were sensible of\r\nGod's being present for their assistance. Whence it came to pass that\r\nthose Greeks, who had a veneration for our laws, because they could not\r\npossibly contradict this, called that breastplate the Oracle. Now this\r\nbreastplate, and this sardonyx, left off shining two hundred years\r\nbefore I composed this book, God having been displeased at the\r\ntransgressions of his laws. Of which things we shall further discourse\r\non a fitter opportunity; but I will now go on with my proposed\r\nnarration.\r\n\r\n10. The tabernacle being now consecrated, and a regular order being\r\nsettled for the priests, the multitude judged that God now dwelt among\r\nthem, and betook themselves to sacrifices and praises to God as being\r\nnow delivered from all expectation of evils and as entertaining a\r\nhopeful prospect of better times hereafter. They offered also gifts to\r\nGod some as common to the whole nation, and others as peculiar to\r\nthemselves, and these tribe by tribe; for the heads of the tribes\r\ncombined together, two by two, and brought a waggon and a yoke of oxen.\r\nThese amounted to six, and they carried the tabernacle when they\r\njourneyed. Besides which, each head of a tribe brought a bowl, and a\r\ncharger, and a spoon, of ten darics, full of incense. Now the charger\r\nand the bowl were of silver, and together they weighed two hundred\r\nshekels, but the bowl cost no more than seventy shekels; and these were\r\nfull of fine flour mingled with oil, such as they used on the altar\r\nabout the sacrifices. They brought also a young bullock, and a ram, with\r\na lamb of a year old, for a whole burnt-offering, as also a goat for the\r\nforgiveness of sins. Every one of the heads of the tribes brought also\r\nother sacrifices, called peace-offerings, for every day two bulls, and\r\nfive rams, with lambs of a year old, and kids of the goats. These heads\r\nof tribes were twelve days in sacrificing, one sacrificing every day.\r\nNow Moses went no longer up to Mount Sinai, but went into the\r\ntabernacle, and learned of God what they were to do, and what laws\r\nshould be made; which laws were preferable to what have been devised by\r\nhuman understanding, and proved to be firmly observed for all time to\r\ncome, as being believed to be the gift of God, insomuch that the Hebrews\r\ndid not transgress any of those laws, either as tempted in times of\r\npeace by luxury, or in times of war by distress of affairs. But I say no\r\nmore here concerning them, because I have resolved to compose another\r\nwork concerning our laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. The Manner Of Our Offering Sacrifices.\r\n\r\n1. I Will now, however, make mention of a few of our laws which belong\r\nto purifications, and the like sacred offices, since I am accidentally\r\ncome to this matter of sacrifices. These sacrifices were of two sorts;\r\nof those sorts one was offered for private persons, and the other for\r\nthe people in general; and they are done in two different ways. In the\r\none case, what is slain is burnt, as a whole burnt-offering, whence that\r\nname is given to it; but the other is a thank-offering, and is designed\r\nfor feasting those that sacrifice. I will speak of the former. Suppose a\r\nprivate man offer a burnt-offering, he must slay either a bull, a lamb,\r\nor a kid of the goats, and the two latter of the first year, though of\r\nbulls he is permitted to sacrifice those of a greater age; but all\r\nburnt-offerings are to be of males. When they are slain, the priests\r\nsprinkle the blood round about the altar; they then cleanse the bodies,\r\nand divide them into parts, and salt them with salt, and lay them upon\r\nthe altar, while the pieces of wood are piled one upon another, and the\r\nfire is burning; they next cleanse the feet of the sacrifices, and the\r\ninwards, in an accurate manner and so lay them to the rest to be purged\r\nby the fire, while the priests receive the hides. This is the way of\r\noffering a burnt-offering.\r\n\r\n2. But those that offer thank-offerings do indeed sacrifice the same\r\ncreatures, but such as are unblemished, and above a year old; however,\r\nthey may take either males or females. They also sprinkle the altar with\r\ntheir blood; but they lay upon the altar the kidneys and the caul, and\r\nall the fat, and the lobe of the liver, together with the rump of the\r\nlamb; then, giving the breast and the right shoulder to the priests, the\r\nofferers feast upon the remainder of the flesh for two days; and what\r\nremains they burn.\r\n\r\n3. The sacrifices for sins are offered in the same manner as is the\r\nthank-offering. But those who are unable to purchase complete\r\nsacrifices, offer two pigeons, or turtle doves; the one of which is made\r\na burnt-offering to God, the other they give as food to the priests. But\r\nwe shall treat more accurately about the oblation of these creatures in\r\nour discourse concerning sacrifices. But if a person fall into sin by\r\nignorance, he offers an ewe lamb, or a female kid of the goats, of the\r\nsame age; and the priests sprinkle the blood at the altar, not after the\r\nformer manner, but at the corners of it. They also bring the kidneys and\r\nthe rest of the fat, together with the lobe of the liver, to the altar,\r\nwhile the priests bear away the hides and the flesh, and spend it in the\r\nholy place, on the same day; 23 for the law does not permit them to\r\nleave of it until the morning. But if any one sin, and is conscious of\r\nit himself, but hath nobody that can prove it upon him, he offers a ram,\r\nthe law enjoining him so to do; the flesh of which the priests eat, as\r\nbefore, in the holy place, on the same day. And if the rulers offer\r\nsacrifices for their sins, they bring the same oblations that private\r\nmen do; only they so far differ, that they are to bring for sacrifices a\r\nbull or a kid of the goats, both males.\r\n\r\n4. Now the law requires, both in private and public sacrifices, that the\r\nfinest flour be also brought; for a lamb the measure of one tenth\r\ndeal,—for a ram two,—and for a bull three. This they consecrate upon the\r\naltar, when it is mingled with oil; for oil is also brought by those\r\nthat sacrifice; for a bull the half of an hin, and for a ram the third\r\npart of the same measure, and one quarter of it for a lamb. This hin is\r\nan ancient Hebrew measure, and is equivalent to two Athenian choas [or\r\ncongiuses]. They bring the same quantity of oil which they do of wine,\r\nand they pour the wine about the altar; but if any one does not offer a\r\ncomplete sacrifice of animals, but brings fine flour only for a vow, he\r\nthrows a handful upon the altar as its first-fruits, while the priests\r\ntake the rest for their food, either boiled or mingled with oil, but\r\nmade into cakes of bread. But whatsoever it be that a priest himself\r\noffers, it must of necessity be all burnt. Now the law forbids us to\r\nsacrifice any animal at the same time with its dam; and, in other cases,\r\nnot till the eighth day after its birth. Other sacrifices there are also\r\nappointed for escaping distempers, or for other occasions, in which\r\nmeat-offerings are consumed, together with the animals that are\r\nsacrificed; of which it is not lawful to leave any part till the next\r\nday, only the priests are to take their own share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. Concerning The Festivals; And How Each Day Of Such Festival\r\nIs To Be Observed.\r\n\r\n1. The law requires, that out of the public expenses a lamb of the first\r\nyear be killed every day, at the beginning and at the ending of the day;\r\nbut on the seventh day, which is called the Sabbath, they kill two, and\r\nsacrifice them in the same manner. At the new moon, they both perform\r\nthe daily sacrifices, and slay two bulls, with seven lambs of the first\r\nyear, and a kid of the goats also, for the expiation of sins; that is,\r\nif they have sinned through ignorance.\r\n\r\n2. But on the seventh month, which the Macedonians call Hyperberetaeus,\r\nthey make an addition to those already mentioned, and sacrifice a bull,\r\na ram, and seven lambs, and a kid of the goats, for sins.\r\n\r\n3. On the tenth day of the same lunar month, they fast till the evening;\r\nand this day they sacrifice a bull, and two rams, and seven lambs, and a\r\nkid of the goats, for sins. And, besides these, they bring two kids of\r\nthe goats; the one of which is sent alive out of the limits of the camp\r\ninto the wilderness for the scapegoat, and to be an expiation for the\r\nsins of the whole multitude; but the other is brought into a place of\r\ngreat cleanness, within the limits of the camp, and is there burnt, with\r\nits skin, without any sort of cleansing. With this goat was burnt a\r\nbull, not brought by the people, but by the high priest, at his own\r\ncharges; which, when it was slain, he brought of the blood into the holy\r\nplace, together with the blood of the kid of the goats, and sprinkled\r\nthe ceiling with his finger seven times, as also its pavement, and again\r\nas often toward the most holy place, and about the golden altar: he also\r\nat last brings it into the open court, and sprinkles it about the great\r\naltar. Besides this, they set the extremities, and the kidneys, and the\r\nfat, with the lobe of the liver, upon the altar. The high priest\r\nlikewise presents a ram to God as a burnt-offering.\r\n\r\n4. Upon the fifteenth day of the same month, when the season of the year\r\nis changing for winter, the law enjoins us to pitch tabernacles in every\r\none of our houses, so that we preserve ourselves from the cold of that\r\ntime of the year; as also that when we should arrive at our own country,\r\nand come to that city which we should have then for our metropolis,\r\nbecause of the temple therein to be built, and keep a festival for eight\r\ndays, and offer burnt-offerings, and sacrifice thank-offerings, that we\r\nshould then carry in our hands a branch of myrtle, and willow, and a\r\nbough of the palm-tree, with the addition of the pome citron: That the\r\nburnt-offering on the first of those days was to be a sacrifice of\r\nthirteen bulls, and fourteen lambs, and fifteen rams, with the addition\r\nof a kid of the goats, as an expiation for sins; and on the following\r\ndays the same number of lambs, and of rams, with the kids of the goats;\r\nbut abating one of the bulls every day till they amounted to seven only.\r\nOn the eighth day all work was laid aside, and then, as we said before,\r\nthey sacrificed to God a bullock, a ram, and seven lambs, with a kid of\r\nthe goats, for an expiation of sins. And this is the accustomed\r\nsolemnity of the Hebrews, when they pitch their tabernacles.24\r\n\r\n5. In the month of Xanthicus, which is by us called Nisan, and is the\r\nbeginning of our year, on the fourteenth day of the lunar month, when\r\nthe sun is in Aries, [for in this month it was that we were delivered\r\nfrom bondage under the Egyptians,] the law ordained that we should every\r\nyear slay that sacrifice which I before told you we slew when we came\r\nout of Egypt, and which was called the Passover; and so we do celebrate\r\nthis passover in companies, leaving nothing of what we sacrifice till\r\nthe day following. The feast of unleavened bread succeeds that of the\r\npassover, and falls on the fifteenth day of the month, and continues\r\nseven days, wherein they feed on unleavened bread; on every one of which\r\ndays two bulls are killed, and one ram, and seven lambs. Now these lambs\r\nare entirely burnt, besides the kid of the goats which is added to all\r\nthe rest, for sins; for it is intended as a feast for the priest on\r\nevery one of those days. But on the second day of unleavened bread,\r\nwhich is the sixteenth day of the month, they first partake of the\r\nfruits of the earth, for before that day they do not touch them. And\r\nwhile they suppose it proper to honor God, from whom they obtain this\r\nplentiful provision, in the first place, they offer the first-fruits of\r\ntheir barley, and that in the manner following: They take a handful of\r\nthe ears, and dry them, then beat them small, and purge the barley from\r\nthe bran; they then bring one tenth deal to the altar, to God; and,\r\ncasting one handful of it upon the fire, they leave the rest for the use\r\nof the priest. And after this it is that they may publicly or privately\r\nreap their harvest. They also at this participation of the first-fruits\r\nof the earth, sacrifice a lamb, as a burnt-offering to God.\r\n\r\n6. When a week of weeks has passed over after this sacrifice, [which\r\nweeks contain forty and nine days,] on the fiftieth day, which is\r\nPentecost, but is called by the Hebrews Asartha, which signifies\r\nPentecost, they bring to God a loaf, made of wheat flour, of two tenth\r\ndeals, with leaven; and for sacrifices they bring two lambs; and when\r\nthey have only presented them to God, they are made ready for supper for\r\nthe priests; nor is it permitted to leave any thing of them till the day\r\nfollowing. They also slay three bullocks for a burnt-offering, and two\r\nrams; and fourteen lambs, with two kids of the goats, for sins; nor is\r\nthere anyone of the festivals but in it they offer burnt-offerings; they\r\nalso allow themselves to rest on every one of them. Accordingly, the law\r\nprescribes in them all what kinds they are to sacrifice, and how they\r\nare to rest entirely, and must slay sacrifices, in order to feast upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n7. However, out of the common charges, baked bread [was set on the table\r\nof shew-bread], without leaven, of twenty-four tenth deals of flour, for\r\nso much is spent upon this bread; two heaps of these were baked, they\r\nwere baked the day before the sabbath, but were brought into the holy\r\nplace on the morning of the sabbath, and set upon the holy table, six on\r\na heap, one loaf still standing over against another; where two golden\r\ncups full of frankincense were also set upon them, and there they\r\nremained till another sabbath, and then other loaves were brought in\r\ntheir stead, while the loaves were given to the priests for their food,\r\nand the frankincense was burnt in that sacred fire wherein all their\r\nofferings were burnt also; and so other frankincense was set upon the\r\nloaves instead of what was there before. The high priest also, of his\r\nown charges, offered a sacrifice, and that twice every day. It was made\r\nof flour mingled with oil, and gently baked by the fire; the quantity\r\nwas one tenth deal of flour; he brought the half of it to the fire in\r\nthe morning, and the other half at night. The account of these\r\nsacrifices I shall give more accurately hereafter; but I think I have\r\npremised what for the present may be sufficient concerning them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. Of The Purifications.\r\n\r\n1. Moses took out the tribe of Levi from communicating with the rest of\r\nthe people, and set them apart to be a holy tribe; and purified them by\r\nwater taken from perpetual springs, and with such sacrifices as were\r\nusually offered to God on the like occasions. He delivered to them also\r\nthe tabernacle, and the sacred vessels, and the other curtains, which\r\nwere made for covering the tabernacle, that they might minister under\r\nthe conduct of the priests, who had been already consecrated to God.\r\n\r\n2. He also determined concerning animals; which of them might be used\r\nfor food, and which they were obliged to abstain from; which matters,\r\nwhen this work shall give me occasion, shall be further explained; and\r\nthe causes shall be added by which he was moved to allot some of them to\r\nbe our food, and enjoined us to abstain from others. However, he\r\nentirely forbade us the use of blood for food, and esteemed it to\r\ncontain the soul and spirit. He also forbade us to eat the flesh of an\r\nanimal that died of itself, as also the caul, and the fat of goats, and\r\nsheep, and bulls.\r\n\r\n3. He also ordered that those whose bodies were afflicted with leprosy,\r\nand that had a gonorrhea, should not come into the city; nay, he removed\r\nthe women, when they had their natural purgations, till the seventh day;\r\nafter which he looked on them as pure, and permitted them to come in\r\nagain. The law permits those also who have taken care of funerals to\r\ncome in after the same manner, when this number of days is over; but if\r\nany continued longer than that number of days in a state of pollution,\r\nthe law appointed the offering two lambs for a sacrifice; the one of\r\nwhich they are to purge by fire, and for the other, the priests take it\r\nfor themselves. In the same manner do those sacrifice who have had the\r\ngonorrhea. But he that sheds his seed in his sleep, if he go down into\r\ncold water, has the same privilege with those that have lawfully\r\naccompanied with their wives. And for the lepers, he suffered them not\r\nto come into the city at all, nor to live with any others, as if they\r\nwere in effect dead persons; but if any one had obtained by prayer to\r\nGod, the recovery from that distemper, and had gained a healthful\r\ncomplexion again, such a one returned thanks to God, with several sorts\r\nof sacrifices; concerning which we will speak hereafter.\r\n\r\n4. Whence one cannot but smile at those who say that Moses was himself\r\nafflicted with the leprosy when he fled out of Egypt, and that he became\r\nthe conductor of those who on that account left that country, and led\r\nthem into the land of Canaan; for had this been true, Moses would not\r\nhave made these laws to his own dishonor, which indeed it was more\r\nlikely he would have opposed, if others had endeavored to introduce\r\nthem; and this the rather, because there are lepers in many nations, who\r\nyet are in honor, and not only free from reproach and avoidance, but who\r\nhave been great captains of armies, and been intrusted with high offices\r\nin the commonwealth, and have had the privilege of entering into holy\r\nplaces and temples; so that nothing hindered, but if either Moses\r\nhimself, or the multitude that was with him, had been liable to such a\r\nmisfortune in the color of his skin, he might have made laws about them\r\nfor their credit and advantage, and have laid no manner of difficulty\r\nupon them. Accordingly, it is a plain case, that it is out of violent\r\nprejudice only that they report these things about us. But Moses was\r\npure from any such distemper, and lived with countrymen who were pure of\r\nit also, and thence made the laws which concerned others that had the\r\ndistemper. He did this for the honor of God. But as to these matters,\r\nlet every one consider them after what manner he pleases.\r\n\r\n5. As to the women, when they have born a child, Moses forbade them to\r\ncome into the temple, or touch the sacrifices, before forty days were\r\nover, supposing it to be a boy; but if she hath born a girl, the law is\r\nthat she cannot be admitted before twice that number of days be over.\r\nAnd when after the before-mentioned time appointed for them, they\r\nperform their sacrifices, the priests distribute them before God.\r\n\r\n6. But if any one suspect that his wife has been guilty of adultery, he\r\nwas to bring a tenth deal of barley flour; they then cast one handful to\r\nGod and gave the rest of it to the priests for food. One of the priests\r\nset the woman at the gates that are turned towards the temple, and took\r\nthe veil from her head, and wrote the name of God on parchment, and\r\nenjoined her to swear that she had not at all injured her husband; and\r\nto wish that, if she had violated her chastity, her right thigh might be\r\nput out of joint; that her belly might swell; and that she might die\r\nthus: but that if her husband, by the violence of his affection, and of\r\nthe jealousy which arose from it, had been rashly moved to this\r\nsuspicion, that she might bear a male child in the tenth month. Now when\r\nthese oaths were over, the priest wiped the name of God out of the\r\nparchment, and wrung the water into a vial. He also took some dust out\r\nof the temple, if any happened to be there, and put a little of it into\r\nthe vial, and gave it her to drink; whereupon the woman, if she were\r\nunjustly accused, conceived with child, and brought it to perfection in\r\nher womb: but if she had broken her faith of wedlock to her husband, and\r\nhad sworn falsely before God, she died in a reproachful manner; her\r\nthigh fell off from her, and her belly swelled with a dropsy. And these\r\nare the ceremonies about sacrifices, and about the purifications thereto\r\nbelonging, which Moses provided for his countrymen. He also prescribed\r\nthe following laws to them:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. Several Laws.\r\n\r\n1. As for adultery, Moses forbade it entirely, as esteeming it a happy\r\nthing that men should be wise in the affairs of wedlock; and that it was\r\nprofitable both to cities and families that children should be known to\r\nbe genuine. He also abhorred men's lying with their mothers, as one of\r\nthe greatest crimes; and the like for lying with the father's wife, and\r\nwith aunts, and sisters, and sons' wives, as all instances of abominable\r\nwickedness. He also forbade a man to lie with his wife when she was\r\ndefiled by her natural purgation: and not to come near brute beasts; nor\r\nto approve of the lying with a male, which was to hunt after unlawful\r\npleasures on account of beauty. To those who were guilty of such\r\ninsolent behavior, he ordained death for their punishment.\r\n\r\n2. As for the priests, he prescribed to them a double degree of purity\r\n25 for he restrained them in the instances above, and moreover forbade\r\nthem to marry harlots. He also forbade them to marry a slave, or a\r\ncaptive, and such as got their living by cheating trades, and by keeping\r\ninns; as also a woman parted from her husband, on any account\r\nwhatsoever. Nay, he did not think it proper for the high priest to marry\r\neven the widow of one that was dead, though he allowed that to the\r\npriests; but he permitted him only to marry a virgin, and to retain her.\r\nWhence it is that the high priest is not to come near to one that is\r\ndead, although the rest are not prohibited from coming near to their\r\nbrethren, or parents, or children, when they are dead; but they are to\r\nbe unblemished in all respects. He ordered that the priest who had any\r\nblemish, should have his portion indeed among the priests, but he\r\nforbade him to ascend the altar, or to enter into the holy house. He\r\nalso enjoined them, not only to observe purity in their sacred\r\nministrations, but in their daily conversation, that it might be\r\nunblamable also. And on this account it is that those who wear the\r\nsacerdotal garments are without spot, and eminent for their purity and\r\nsobriety: nor are they permitted to drink wine so long as they wear\r\nthose garments. 26 Moreover, they offer sacrifices that are entire, and\r\nhave no defect whatsoever.\r\n\r\n3. And truly Moses gave them all these precepts, being such as were\r\nobserved during his own lifetime; but though he lived now in the\r\nwilderness, yet did he make provision how they might observe the same\r\nlaws when they should have taken the land of Canaan. He gave them rest\r\nto the land from ploughing and planting every seventh year, as he had\r\nprescribed to them to rest from working every seventh day; and ordered,\r\nthat then what grew of its own accord out of the earth should in common\r\nbelong to all that pleased to use it, making no distinction in that\r\nrespect between their own countrymen and foreigners: and he ordained,\r\nthat they should do the same after seven times seven years, which in all\r\nare fifty years; and that fiftieth year is called by the Hebrews The\r\nJubilee, wherein debtors are freed from their debts, and slaves are set\r\nat liberty; which slaves became such, though they were of the same\r\nstock, by transgressing some of those laws the punishment of which was\r\nnot capital, but they were punished by this method of slavery. This year\r\nalso restores the land to its former possessors in the manner\r\nfollowing:—When the Jubilee is come, which name denotes liberty, he that\r\nsold the land, and he that bought it, meet together, and make an\r\nestimate, on one hand, of the fruits gathered; and, on the other hand,\r\nof the expenses laid out upon it. If the fruits gathered come to more\r\nthan the expenses laid out, he that sold it takes the land again; but if\r\nthe expenses prove more than the fruits, the present possessor receives\r\nof the former owner the difference that was wanting, and leaves the land\r\nto him; and if the fruits received, and the expenses laid out, prove\r\nequal to one another, the present possessor relinquishes it to the\r\nformer owners. Moses would have the same law obtain as to those houses\r\nalso which were sold in villages; but he made a different law for such\r\nas were sold in a city; for if he that sold it tendered the purchaser\r\nhis money again within a year, he was forced to restore it; but in case\r\na whole year had intervened, the purchaser was to enjoy what he had\r\nbought. This was the constitution of the laws which Moses learned of God\r\nwhen the camp lay under Mount Sinai, and this he delivered in writing to\r\nthe Hebrews.\r\n\r\n4. Now when this settlement of laws seemed to be well over, Moses\r\nthought fit at length to take a review of the host, as thinking it\r\nproper to settle the affairs of war. So he charged the heads of the\r\ntribes, excepting the tribe of Levi, to take an exact account of the\r\nnumber of those that were able to go to war; for as to the Levites, they\r\nwere holy, and free from all such burdens. Now when the people had been\r\nnumbered, there were found six hundred thousand that were able to go to\r\nwar, from twenty to fifty years of age, besides three thousand six\r\nhundred and fifty. Instead of Levi, Moses took Manasseh, the son of\r\nJoseph, among the heads of tribes; and Ephraim instead of Joseph. It was\r\nindeed the desire of Jacob himself to Joseph, that he would give him his\r\nsons to be his own by adoption, as I have before related.\r\n\r\n5. When they set up the tabernacle, they received it into the midst of\r\ntheir camp, three of the tribes pitching their tents on each side of it;\r\nand roads were cut through the midst of these tents. It was like a well-\r\nappointed market; and every thing was there ready for sale in due order;\r\nand all sorts of artificers were in the shops; and it resembled nothing\r\nso much as a city that sometimes was movable, and sometimes fixed. The\r\npriests had the first places about the tabernacle; then the Levites,\r\nwho, because their whole multitude was reckoned from thirty days old,\r\nwere twenty-three thousand eight hundred and eighty males; and during\r\nthe time that the cloud stood over the tabernacle, they thought proper\r\nto stay in the same place, as supposing that God there inhabited among\r\nthem; but when that removed, they journeyed also.\r\n\r\n6. Moreover, Moses was the inventor of the form of their trumpet, which\r\nwas made of silver. Its description is this:—In length it was little\r\nless than a cubit. It was composed of a narrow tube, somewhat thicker\r\nthan a flute, but with so much breadth as was sufficient for admission\r\nof the breath of a man's mouth: it ended in the form of a bell, like\r\ncommon trumpets. Its sound was called in the Hebrew tongue Asosra. Two\r\nof these being made, one of them was sounded when they required the\r\nmultitude to come together to congregations. When the first of them gave\r\na signal, the heads of the tribes were to assemble, and consult about\r\nthe affairs to them properly belonging; but when they gave the signal by\r\nboth of them, they called the multitude together. Whenever the\r\ntabernacle was removed, it was done in this solemn order:—At the first\r\nalarm of the trumpet, those whose tents were on the east quarter\r\nprepared to remove; when the second signal was given, those that were on\r\nthe south quarter did the like; in the next place, the tabernacle was\r\ntaken to pieces, and was carried in the midst of six tribes that went\r\nbefore, and of six that followed, all the Levites assisting about the\r\ntabernacle; when the third signal was given, that part which had their\r\ntents towards the west put themselves in motion; and at the fourth\r\nsignal those on the north did so likewise. They also made use of these\r\ntrumpets in their sacred ministrations, when they were bringing their\r\nsacrifices to the altar as well on the Sabbaths as on the rest of the\r\n[festival] days; and now it was that Moses offered that sacrifice which\r\nwas called the Passover in the Wilderness, as the first he had offered\r\nafter the departure out of Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. Moses Removed From Mount Sinai, And Conducted The People To\r\nThe Borders Of The Canaanites.\r\n\r\nA Little while afterwards he rose up, and went from Mount Sinai; and,\r\nhaving passed through several mansions, of which we will speak he came\r\nto a place called Hazeroth, where the multitude began again to be\r\nmutinous, and to Moses for the misfortunes they had suffered their\r\ntravels; and that when he had persuaded to leave a good land, they at\r\nonce had lost land, and instead of that happy state he had them, they\r\nwere still wandering in their miserable condition, being already in want\r\nof water; and if the manna should happen to fail, must then utterly\r\nperish. Yet while they spake many and sore things against the there was\r\none of them who exhorted them to be unmindful of Moses, and of what\r\ngreat pains he had been at about their common safety; not to despair of\r\nassistance from God. The multitude thereupon became still more unruly,\r\nand mutinous against Moses than before. Hereupon Moses, although he was\r\nso basely abused by them encouraged them in their despairing conditioned\r\nand promised that he would procure them a quantity of flesh-meat, and\r\nthat not for a few days only, but for many days. This they were not to\r\nbelieve; and when one of them asked, whence he could obtain such vast\r\nplenty of what he promised, he replied, \"Neither God nor I, we hear such\r\nopprobrious language from will leave off our labors for you; and this\r\nsoon appear also.\" As soon as ever he had said this, the whole camp was\r\nfilled with quails, they stood round about them, and gathered great\r\nnumbers. However, it was not long ere God punished the Hebrews for their\r\ninsolence, those reproaches they had used towards him, no small number\r\nof them died; and still to this day the place retains the memory of this\r\ndestruction and is named Kibrothhattaavah, which is, Graves of Lust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. How Moses Sent Some Persons To Search Out The Land Of The\r\nCanaanites, And The Largeness Of Their Cities; And Further That When\r\nThose Who Were Sent Were Returned, After Forty Days And Reported That\r\nThey Should Not Be A Match For Them, And Extolled The Strength Of The\r\nCanaanites The Multitude Were Disturbed And Fell Into Despair; And Were\r\nResolved To Stone Moses, And To Return Back Again Into Egypt, And Serve\r\nThe Egyptians.\r\n\r\n1. When Moses had led the Hebrews away from thence to a place called\r\nParan, which was near to the borders of the Canaanites, and a place\r\ndifficult to be continued in, he gathered the multitude together to a\r\ncongregation; and standing in the midst of them, he said, \"Of the two\r\nthings that God determined to bestow upon us, liberty, and the\r\npossession of a Happy Country, the one of them ye already are partakers\r\nof, by the gift of God, and the other you will quickly obtain; for we\r\nnow have our abode near the borders of the Canaanites, and nothing can\r\nhinder the acquisition of it, when we now at last are fallen upon it: I\r\nsay, not only no king nor city, but neither the whole race of mankind,\r\nif they were all gathered together, could do it. Let us therefore\r\nprepare ourselves for the work, for the Canaanites will not resign up\r\ntheir land to us without fighting, but it must be wrested from them by\r\ngreat struggles in war. Let us then send spies, who may take a view of\r\nthe goodness of the land, and what strength it is of; but, above all\r\nthings, let us be of one mind, and let us honor God, who above all is\r\nour helper and assister.\"\r\n\r\n2. When Moses had said thus, the multitude requited him with marks of\r\nrespect; and chose twelve spies, of the most eminent men, one out of\r\neach tribe, who, passing over all the land of Canaan, from the borders\r\nof Egypt, came to the city Hamath, and to Mount Lebanon; and having\r\nlearned the nature of the land, and of its inhabitants, they came home,\r\nhaving spent forty days in the whole work. They also brought with them\r\nof the fruits which the land bare; they also showed them the excellency\r\nof those fruits, and gave an account of the great quantity of the good\r\nthings that land afforded, which were motives to the multitude to go to\r\nwar. But then they terrified them again with the great difficulty there\r\nwas in obtaining it; that the rivers were so large and deep that they\r\ncould not be passed over; and that the hills were so high that they\r\ncould not travel along for them; that the cities were strong with walls,\r\nand their firm fortifications round about them. They told them also,\r\nthat they found at Hebron the posterity of the giants. Accordingly these\r\nspies, who had seen the land of Canaan, when they perceived that all\r\nthese difficulties were greater there than they had met with since they\r\ncame out of Egypt, they were affrighted at them themselves, and\r\nendeavored to affright the multitude also.\r\n\r\n3. So they supposed, from what they had heard, that it was impossible to\r\nget the possession of the country. And when the congregation was\r\ndissolved, they, their wives and children, continued their lamentation,\r\nas if God would not indeed assist them, but only promised them fair.\r\nThey also again blamed Moses, and made a clamor against him and his\r\nbrother Aaron, the high priest. Accordingly they passed that night very\r\nill, and with contumelious language against them; but in the morning\r\nthey ran to a congregation, intending to stone Moses and Aaron, and so\r\nto return back into Egypt.\r\n\r\n4. But of the spies, there were Joshua the son of Nun, of the tribe of\r\nEphraim, and Caleb of the tribe of Judah, that were afraid of the\r\nconsequence, and came into the midst of them, and stilled the multitude,\r\nand desired them to be of good courage; and neither to condemn God, as\r\nhaving told them lies, nor to hearken to those who had affrighted them,\r\nby telling them what was not true concerning the Canaanites, but to\r\nthose that encouraged them to hope for good success; and that they\r\nshould gain possession of the happiness promised them, because neither\r\nthe height of mountains, nor the depth of rivers, could hinder men of\r\ntrue courage from attempting them, especially while God would take care\r\nof them beforehand, and be assistant to them. \"Let us then go,\" said\r\nthey, \"against our enemies, and have no suspicion of ill success,\r\ntrusting in God to conduct us, and following those that are to be our\r\nleaders.\" Thus did these two exhort them, and endeavor to pacify the\r\nrage they were in. But Moses and Aaron fell on the ground, and besought\r\nGod, not for their own deliverance, but that he would put a stop to what\r\nthe people were unwarily doing, and would bring their minds to a quiet\r\ntemper, which were now disordered by their present passion. The cloud\r\nalso did now appear, and stood over the tabernacle, and declared to them\r\nthe presence of God to be there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15. How Moses Was Displeased At This, And Foretold That God Was\r\nAngry And That They Should Continue In The Wilderness For Forty Years\r\nAnd Not, During That Time, Either Return Into Egypt Or Take Possession\r\nOf Canaan.\r\n\r\n1. Moses came now boldly to the multitude, and informed them that God\r\nwas moved at their abuse of him, and would inflict punishment upon them,\r\nnot indeed such as they deserved for their sins, but such as parents\r\ninflict on their children, in order to their correction. For, he said,\r\nthat when he was in the tabernacle, and was bewailing with ears that\r\ndestruction which was coming upon them God put him in mind what things\r\nhe had done for them, and what benefits they had received from him, and\r\nyet how ungrateful they had been to him that just now they had been\r\ninduced, through the timorousness of the spies, to think that their\r\nwords were truer than his own promise to them; and that on this account,\r\nthough he would not indeed destroy them all, nor utterly exterminate\r\ntheir nation, which he had honored more than any other part of mankind,\r\nyet he would not permit them to take possession of the land of Canaan,\r\nnor enjoy its happiness; but would make them wander in the wilderness,\r\nand live without a fixed habitation, and without a city, for forty years\r\ntogether, as a punishment for this their transgression; but that he had\r\npromised to give that land to our children, and that he would make them\r\nthe possessors of those good things which, by your ungoverned passions,\r\nyou have deprived yourselves of.\r\n\r\n2. When Moses had discoursed thus to them according to the direction of\r\nGod, the multitude grieved, and were in affliction; and entreated Most\r\nto procure their reconciliation to God, and to permit them no longer to\r\nwander in the wilderness, but bestow cities upon them. But he replied,\r\nthat God would not admit of any such trial, for that God was not moved\r\nto this determination from any human levity or anger, but that he had\r\njudicially condemned them to that punishment. Now we are not to\r\ndisbelieve that Moses, who was but a single person, pacified so many ten\r\nthousands when they were in anger, and converted them to a mildness\r\ntemper; for God was with him, and prepared way to his persuasions of the\r\nmultitude; and as they had often been disobedient, they were now\r\nsensible that such disobedience was disadvantageous to them and that\r\nthey had still thereby fallen into calamities.\r\n\r\n3. But this man was admirable for his virtue, and powerful in making men\r\ngive credit to what he delivered, not only during the time of his\r\nnatural life, but even there is still no one of the Hebrews who does not\r\nact even now as if Moses were present, and ready to punish him if he\r\nshould do any thing that is indecent; nay, there is no one but is\r\nobedient to what laws he ordained, although they might be concealed in\r\ntheir transgressions. There are also many other demonstrations that his\r\npower was more than human, for still some there have been, who have come\r\nfrom the parts beyond Euphrates, a journey of four months, through many\r\ndangers, and at great expenses, in honor of our temple; and yet, when\r\nthey had offered their oblations, could not partake of their own\r\nsacrifices, because Moses had forbidden it, by somewhat in the law that\r\ndid not permit them, or somewhat that had befallen them, which our\r\nancient customs made inconsistent therewith; some of these did not\r\nsacrifice at all, and others left their sacrifices in an imperfect\r\ncondition; many were not able, even at first, so much as to enter the\r\ntemple, but went their ways in this as preferring a submission to the\r\nlaws of Moses before the fulfilling of their own inclinations, they had\r\nno fear upon them that anybody could convict them, but only out of a\r\nreverence to their own conscience. Thus this legislation, which appeared\r\nto be divine, made this man to be esteemed as one superior to his own\r\nnature. Nay, further, a little before the beginning of this war, when\r\nClaudius was emperor of the Romans, and Ismael was our high priest, and\r\nwhen so great a famine 27 was come upon us, that one tenth deal [of\r\nwheat] was sold for four drachmae, and when no less than seventy cori of\r\nflour were brought into the temple, at the feast of unleavened bread,\r\n[these cori are thirty-one Sicilian, but forty-one Athenian medimni,]\r\nnot one of the priests was so hardy as to eat one crumb of it, even\r\nwhile so great a distress was upon the land; and this out of a dread of\r\nthe law, and of that wrath which God retains against acts of wickedness,\r\neven when no one can accuse the actors. Whence we are not to wonder at\r\nwhat was then done, while to this very day the writings left by Moses\r\nhave so great a force, that even those that hate us do confess, that he\r\nwho established this settlement was God, and that it was by the means of\r\nMoses, and of his virtue; but as to these matters, let every one take\r\nthem as he thinks fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Dr. Bernard takes notice here, that this place Mar, where\r\nthe waters were bitter, is called by the Syrians and Arabians Mariri,\r\nand by the Syrians sometimes Morath, all derived from the Hebrew Mar. He\r\nalso takes notice, that it is called The Bitter Fountain by Pliny\r\nhimself; which waters remain there to this day, and are still bitter, as\r\nThevenot assures us and that there are also abundance of palm-trees. See\r\nhis Travels, Part I. ch. 26. p. 166.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ The additions here to Moses's account of the sweetening of\r\nthe waters at Marah, seem derived from some ancient profane author, and\r\nhe such an author also as looks less authentic than are usually followed\r\nby Josephus. Philo has not a syllable of these additions, nor any other\r\nancienter writer that we know of. Had Josephus written these his\r\nAntiquities for the use of Jews, he would hardly have given them these\r\nvery improbable circumstances; but writing to Gentiles, that they might\r\nnot complain of his omission of any accounts of such miracles derived\r\nfrom Gentiles, he did not think proper to conceal what he had met with\r\nthere about this matter. Which procedure is perfectly agreeable to the\r\ncharacter and usage of Josephus upon many occasions. This note is, I\r\nconfess, barely conjectural; and since Josephus never tells us when his\r\nown copy, taken out of the temple, had such additions, or when any\r\nancient notes supplied them; or indeed when they are derived from\r\nJewish, and when from Gentile antiquity,—we can go no further than bare\r\nconjectures in such cases; only the notions of Jews were generally so\r\ndifferent from those of Gentiles, that we may sometimes make no\r\nimprobable conjectures to which sort such additions belong. See also\r\nsomewhat like these additions in Josephus's account of Elisha's making\r\nsweet the bitter and barren spring near Jericho, War, B. IV. ch. 8.\r\nsect. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ It seems to me, from what Moses, Exodus 16:18, St. Paul, 2\r\nCorinthians 8:15, and Josephus here say, compared together, that the\r\nquantity of manna that fell daily, and did not putrefy, was just so much\r\nas came to an omer apiece, through the whole host of Israel, and no\r\nmore.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ This supposal, that the sweet honey-dew or manna, so\r\ncelebrated in ancient and modern authors, as falling usually in Arabia,\r\nwas of the very same sort with this manna sent to the Israelites, savors\r\nmore of Gentilism than of Judaism or Christianity. It is not improbable\r\nthat some ancient Gentile author, read by Josephus, so thought; nor\r\nwould he here contradict him; though just before, and Antiq. B.

But as to\r\nthe derivation of the word manna, whether from man, which Josephus says\r\nthen signified What is it or from mannah, to divide, i.e., a dividend or\r\nportion allotted to every one, it is uncertain: I incline to the latter\r\nderivation. This manna is called angels' food, Psalm 78:26, and by our\r\nSacior, John 6:31, etc., as well as by Josephus here and elsewhere,\r\nAntiq. B.

Nay, by the way, this posture seemed to have continued in the\r\nChristian church, till the clergy, instead of learning their prayers by\r\nheart, read them out of a book, which is in a great measure inconsistent\r\nwith such an elevated posture, and which seems to me to have been only a\r\nlater practice, introduced under the corrupt state of the church; though\r\nthe constant use of divine forms of prayer, praise, and thanksgiving,\r\nappears to me to have been the practice of God's people, patriarchs,\r\nJews, and Christians, in all the past ages.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8 (return) [ This manner of electing the judges and officers of the\r\nIsraelites by the testimonies and suffrages of the people, before they\r\nwere ordained by God, or by Moses, deserves to be carefully noted,\r\nbecause it was the pattern of the like manner of the choice and\r\nordination of bishops, presbyters, and deacons, in the Christian\r\nchurch.]\r\n\r\n\r\n9 (return) [ Since this mountain, Sinai, is here said to be the highest\r\nof all the mountains that are in that country, it must be that now\r\ncalled St. Katherine's, which is one-third higher than that within a\r\nmile of it, now called Sinai, as Mons.

In the mean time, it is not to be doubted,\r\nbut in their education they must have both learned more Jewish\r\ninterpretations, such as we meet with in the Epistle of Barnabas, in\r\nthat to the Hebrews, and elsewhere among the old Jews. Accordingly when\r\nJosephus wrote his books of the Jewish War, for the use of the Jews, at\r\nwhich time he was comparatively young, and less used to Gentile books,\r\nwe find one specimen of such a Jewish interpretation; for there [B. VII.\r\nch. 5. sect. 5: he makes the seven branches of the temple-candlestick,\r\nwith their seven lamps, an emblem of the seven days of creation and\r\nrest, which are here emblems of the seven planets.

B. VI. ch. 6.\r\nsect. 4; but rather by an audible voice from the mercy- seat between the\r\ncherubims. See Prideaux's Connect. at the year 534. This oracle had been\r\nsilent, as Josephus here informs us, two hundred years before he wrote\r\nhis Antiquities, or ever since the days of the last good high priest of\r\nthe family of the Maccabees, John Hyrcanus. Now it is here very well\r\nworth our observation, that the oracle before us was that by which God\r\nappeared to be present with, and gave directions to, his people Israel\r\nas their King, all the while they submitted to him in that capacity; and\r\ndid not set over them such independent kings as governed according to\r\ntheir own wills and political maxims, instead of Divine directions.\r\nAccordingly we meet with this oracle [besides angelic and prophetic\r\nadmonitions] all along from the days of Moses and Joshua to the\r\nanointing of Saul, the first of the succession of the kings, Numbers\r\n27:21; Joshua 6:6, etc.; 19:50; Judges 1:1; 18:4-6, 30, 31; 20:18, 23,\r\n26-28; 21:1, etc.; 1 Samuel 1:17, 18; 3. per tot.; 4. per tot.; nay,\r\ntill Saul's rejection of the Divine commands in the war with Amalek,\r\nwhen he took upon him to act as he thought fit, 1 Samuel 14:3, 18, 19,\r\n36, 37, then this oracle left Saul entirely, [which indeed he had seldom\r\nconsulted before, 1 Samuel 14:35; 1 Chronicles 10:14; 13:3; Antiq. B. 7\r\nch. 4 sect 2.] and accompanied David, who was anointed to succeed him,\r\nand who consulted God by it frequently, and complied with its directions\r\nconstantly [1 Samuel 14:37, 41; 15:26; 22:13, 15; 23:9, 10; 30:7, 8, 18;\r\n2 Samuel 2:1; 5:19, 23; 21:1; 23:14; 1 Chronicles 14:10, 14; Antiq. B IV\r\nch. 12 sect. 5]. Saul, indeed, long after his rejection by God, and when\r\nGod had given him up to destruction for his disobedience, did once\r\nafterwards endeavor to consult God when it was too late; but God would\r\nnot then answer him, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets, 1\r\nSamuel 28:6. Nor did any of David's successors, the kings of Judah, that\r\nwe know of, consult God by this oracle, till the very Babylonish\r\ncaptivity itself, when those kings were at an end; they taking upon\r\nthem, I suppose, too much of despotic power and royalty, and too little\r\nowning the God of Israel for the supreme King of Israel, though a few of\r\nthem consulted the prophets sometimes, and were answered by them. At the\r\nreturn of the two tribes, without the return of the kingly government,\r\nthe restoration of this oracle was expected, Nehemiah 7;63; 1 Esd. 5:40;\r\n1 Macc. 4:46; 14:41. And indeed it may seem to have been restored for\r\nsome time after the Babylonish captivity, at least in the days of that\r\nexcellent high priest, John Hyrcanus, whom Josephus esteemed as a king,\r\na priest, and a prophet; and who, he says, foretold several things that\r\ncame to pass accordingly; but about the time of his death, he here\r\nimplies, that this oracle quite ceased, and not before. The following\r\nhigh priests now putting diadems on their heads, and ruling according to\r\ntheir own will, and by their own authority, like the other kings of the\r\npagan countries about them; so that while the God of Israel was allowed\r\nto be the supreme King of Israel, and his directions to be their\r\nauthentic guides, God gave them such directions as their supreme King\r\nand Governor, and they were properly under a theocracy, by this oracle\r\nof Urim, but no longer [see Dr. Bernard's notes here]; though I confess\r\nI cannot but esteem the high priest Jaddus's divine dream, Antiq. B. XI.\r\nch. 8. sect. 4, and the high priest Caiaphas's most remarkable prophecy,\r\nJohn 11:47-52, as two small remains or specimens of this ancient oracle,\r\nwhich properly belonged to the Jewish high priests: nor perhaps ought we\r\nentirely to forget that eminent prophetic dream of our Josephus himself,\r\n[Footnote one next to a high priest, as of the family of the Asamoneans\r\nor Maccabees,] as to the succession of Vespasian and Titus to the Roman\r\nempire, and that in the days of Nero, and before either Galba, Otho, or\r\nVitellius were thought of to succeed him. Of the War, B. III. ch. 8.\r\nsect. 9. This, I think, may well be looked on as the very last instance\r\nof any thing like the prophetic Urim among the Jewish nation, and just\r\npreceded their fatal desolation: but how it could possibly come to pass\r\nthat such great men as Sir John Marsham and Dr. Spenser, should imagine\r\nthat this oracle of Urim and Thummim with other practices as old or\r\nolder than the law of Moses, should have been ordained in imitation of\r\nsomewhat like them among the Egyptians, which we never hear of till the\r\ndays of Diodorus Siculus, Aelian, and Maimonides, or little earlier than\r\nthe Christian era at the highest, is almost unaccountable; while the\r\nmain business of the law of Moses was evidently to preserve the\r\nIsraelites from the idolatrous and superstitious practices of the\r\nneighboring pagan nations; and while it is so undeniable, that the\r\nevidence for the great antiquity of Moses's law is incomparably beyond\r\nthat for the like or greater antiquity of such customs in Egypt or other\r\nnations, which indeed is generally none at all, it is most absurd to\r\nderive any of Moses's laws from the imitation of those heathen\r\npractices, Such hypotheses demonstrate to us how far inclination can\r\nprevail over evidence, in even some of the most learned part of\r\nmankind.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23 (return) [ What Reland well observes here, out of Josephus, as\r\ncompared with the law of Moses, Leviticus 7:15, [that the eating of the\r\nsacrifice the same day it was offered, seems to mean only before the\r\nmorning of the next, although the latter part, i.e. the night, be in\r\nstrictness part of the next day, according to the Jewish reckoning,] is\r\ngreatly to be observed upon other occasions also. The Jewish maxim in\r\nsuch cases, it seems, is this: That the day goes before the night; and\r\nthis appears to me to be the language both of the Old and New Testament.\r\nSee also the note on Antiq.

Containing The Interval Of Thirty-Eight Years.—From The\r\nRejection Of That Generation To The Death Of Moses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. Fight Of The Hebrews With The Canaanites Without The Consent\r\nOf Moses; And Their Defeat.\r\n\r\n1. Now this life of the Hebrews in the wilderness was so disagreeable\r\nand troublesome to them, and they were so uneasy at it, that although\r\nGod had forbidden them to meddle with the Canaanites, yet could they not\r\nbe persuaded to be obedient to the words of Moses, and to be quiet; but\r\nsupposing they should be able to beat their enemies, without his\r\napprobation, they accused him, and suspected that he made it his\r\nbusiness to keep them in a distressed condition, that they might always\r\nstand in need of his assistance. Accordingly they resolved to fight with\r\nthe Canaanites, and said that God gave them his assistance, not out of\r\nregard to Moses's intercessions, but because he took care of their\r\nentire nation, on account of their forefathers, whose affairs he took\r\nunder his own conduct; as also, that it was on account of their own\r\nvirtue that he had formerly procured them their liberty, and would be\r\nassisting to them, now they were willing to take pains for it. They also\r\nsaid that they were possessed of abilities sufficient for the conquest\r\nof their enemies, although Moses should have a mind to alienate God from\r\nthem; that, however, it was for their advantage to be their own masters,\r\nand not so far to rejoice in their deliverance from the indignities they\r\nendured under the Egyptians, as to bear the tyranny of Moses over them,\r\nand to suffer themselves to be deluded, and live according to his\r\npleasure, as though God did only foretell what concerns us out of his\r\nkindness to him, as if they were not all the posterity of Abraham; that\r\nGod made him alone the author of all the knowledge we have, and we must\r\nstill learn it from him; that it would be a piece of prudence to oppose\r\nhis arrogant pretenses, and to put their confidence in God, and to\r\nresolve to take possession of that land which he had promised them, and\r\nnot to give ear to him, who on this account, and under the pretense of\r\nDivine authority, forbade them so to do. Considering, therefore, the\r\ndistressed state they were in at present, and that in those desert\r\nplaces they were still to expect things would be worse with them, they\r\nresolved to fight with the Canaanites, as submitting only to God, their\r\nsupreme Commander, and not waiting for any assistance from their\r\nlegislator.\r\n\r\n2. When, therefore, they had come to this resolution, as being best for\r\nthem, they went against their enemies; but those enemies were not\r\ndismayed either at the attack itself, or at the great multitude that\r\nmade it, and received them with great courage. Many of the Hebrews were\r\nslain; and the remainder of the army, upon the disorder of their troops,\r\nwere pursued, and fled, after a shameful manner, to their camp.\r\nWhereupon this unexpected misfortune made them quite despond; and they\r\nhoped for nothing that was good; as gathering from it, that this\r\naffliction came from the wrath of God, because they rashly went out to\r\nwar without his approbation.\r\n\r\n3. But when Moses saw how deeply they were affected with this defeat,\r\nand being afraid lest the enemies should grow insolent upon this\r\nvictory, and should be desirous of gaining still greater glory, and\r\nshould attack them, he resolved that it was proper to withdraw the army\r\ninto the wilderness to a further distance from the Canaanites: so the\r\nmultitude gave themselves up again to his conduct, for they were\r\nsensible that, without his care for them, their affairs could not be in\r\na good condition; and he caused the host to remove, and he went further\r\ninto the wilderness, as intending there to let them rest, and not to\r\npermit them to fight the Canaanites before God should afford them a more\r\nfavorable opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. The Sedition Of Corah And Of The Multitude Against Moses, And\r\nAgainst His Brother, Concerning The Priesthood.\r\n\r\n1. That which is usually the case of great armies, and especially upon\r\nill success, to be hard to be pleased, and governed with difficulty, did\r\nnow befall the Jews; for they being in number six hundred thousand, and\r\nby reason of their great multitude not readily subject to their\r\ngovernors, even in prosperity, they at this time were more than usually\r\nangry, both against one another and against their leader, because of the\r\ndistress they were in, and the calamities they then endured. Such a\r\nsedition overtook them, as we have not the like example either among the\r\nGreeks or the Barbarians, by which they were in danger of being all\r\ndestroyed, but were notwithstanding saved by Moses, who would not\r\nremember that he had been almost stoned to death by them. Nor did God\r\nneglect to prevent their ruin; but, notwithstanding the indignities they\r\nhad offered their legislator and the laws, and disobedience to the\r\ncommandments which he had sent them by Moses, he delivered them from\r\nthose terrible calamities which, without his providential care, had been\r\nbrought upon them by this sedition. So I will first explain the cause\r\nwhence this sedition arose, and then will give an account of the\r\nsedition itself; as also of what settlements made for their government\r\nafter it was over.\r\n\r\n2. Corah, a Hebrew of principal account, both by his family and by his\r\nwealth, one that was also able to speak well, and one that could easily\r\npersuade the people by his speeches, saw that Moses was in an exceeding\r\ngreat dignity, and was at it, and envied him on that account, [he of the\r\nsame tribe with Moses, and of kin to him,] was particularly grieved,\r\nbecause he thought he better deserved that honorable post on account of\r\ngreat riches, and not inferior to him in his birth. So he raised a\r\nclamor against him among the Levites, who were of the same tribe, and\r\namong his kindred, saying, \"That it was a very sad thing that they\r\nshould overlook Moses, while he hunted after and paved the way to glory\r\nfor himself, and by ill arts should obtain it, under the pretense of\r\nGod's command, while, contrary to laws, he had given the priesthood to\r\nAaron, the common suffrage of the multitude, but by his own vote, as\r\nbestowing dignities in a way on whom he pleased.\" He added, \"That this\r\nconcealed way of imposing on them was harder to be borne than if it had\r\nbeen done by an open force upon them, because he did now not only usurp\r\ntheir power without their consent, but even they were unapprised of his\r\ncontrivances against them; for whosoever is conscious to himself that he\r\ndeserves any dignity, aims to get it by persuasion, and not by an\r\narrogant method of violence; those that believe it impossible to obtain\r\nhonors justly, make a show of goodness, and do not introduce force, but\r\nby cunning tricks grow wickedly powerful. That it was proper for the\r\nmultitude to punish such men, even while they think themselves concealed\r\nin their designs, and not suffer them to gain strength till they have\r\nthem for their open enemies. For what account,\" added he, \"is Moses able\r\nto give, why he has bestowed the priesthood on Aaron and his sons? for\r\nif God had determined to bestow that honor on one of the tribe of Levi,\r\nI am more worthy of it than he is; I myself being equal to Moses by my\r\nfamily, and superior to him both in riches and in age: but if God had\r\ndetermined to bestow it on the eldest be, that of Reuben might have it\r\nmost justly; and then Dathan, and Abiram, and [On, the son of] Peleth,\r\nwould have it; for these are the oldest men of that tribe, and potent on\r\naccount of their great wealth also.\"\r\n\r\n3. Now Corah, when he said this, had a mind to appear to take care of\r\nthe public welfare, but in reality he was endeavoring to procure to have\r\nthat dignity transferred by the multitude to himself. Thus did he, out\r\nof a malignant design, but with plausible words, discourse to those of\r\nhis own tribe; when these words did gradually spread to more people, and\r\nwhen the hearers still added to what tended to the scandals that were\r\ncast upon Aaron, the whole army was full of them. Now of those that\r\nconspired with Corah, there were two hundred and fifty, and those of the\r\nprincipal men also, who were eager to have the priesthood taken away\r\nfrom Moses's brother, and to bring him into disgrace: nay, the multitude\r\nthemselves were provoked to be seditious, and attempted to stone Moses,\r\nand gathered themselves together after an indecent manner, with\r\nconfusion and disorder. And now all were, in a tumultuous manner,\r\nraising a clamour before the tabernacle of God, to prosecute the tyrant,\r\nand to relieve the multitude from their slavery under him who, under\r\ncolor of the Divine laid violent injunctions upon them; for had it been\r\nGod who chose one that was to perform the office of a priest, he would\r\nhave raised person to that dignity, and would not have produced such a\r\none as was inferior to many others nor have given him that office; and\r\nthat in he had judged it fit to bestow it on Aaron, he would have\r\npermitted it to the multitude to bestow it, and not have left it to be\r\nbestowed by his own brother.\r\n\r\n4. Now although Moses had a great while ago foreseen this calumny of\r\nCorah, and had seen the people were irritated, yet was he not affrighted\r\nat it; but being of good courage, because given them right advice about\r\ntheir affairs, and knowing that his brother had been made partaker of\r\nthe priesthood at the command of God, and not by his own favor to him,\r\nhe came to the assembly; and as for the multitude, he said not a word to\r\nthem, but spake as loud to Corah as he could; and being very skillful in\r\nmaking speeches, and having this natural talent, among others, that he\r\ncould greatly move the multitude with his discourses, he said, \"O Corah,\r\nboth thou and all these with thee [pointing to the two hundred and fifty\r\nmen] seem to be worthy of this honor; nor do I pretend but that this\r\nwhole company may be worthy of the like dignity, although they may not\r\nbe so rich or so great as you are: nor have I taken and given this\r\noffice to my brother because he excelled others in riches, for thou\r\nexceedest us both in the greatness of thy wealth; 1 nor indeed because\r\nhe was of an eminent family, for God, by giving us the same common\r\nancestor, has made our families equal: nay, nor was it out of brotherly\r\naffection, which another might yet have justly done; for certainly,\r\nunless I had bestowed this honor out of regard to God, and to his laws,\r\nI had not passed by myself, and given it to another, as being nearer of\r\nkin to myself than to my brother, and having a closer intimacy with\r\nmyself than I have with him; for surely it would not be a wise thing for\r\nme to expose myself to the dangers of offending, and to bestow the happy\r\nemployment on this account upon another. But I am above such base\r\npractices: nor would God have overlooked this matter, and seen himself\r\nthus despised; nor would he have suffered you to be ignorant of what you\r\nwere to do, in order to please him; but he hath himself chosen one that\r\nis to perform that sacred office to him, and thereby freed us from that\r\ncare. So that it was not a thing that I pretend to give, but only\r\naccording to the determination of God; I therefore propose it still to\r\nbe contended for by such as please to put in for it, only desiring that\r\nhe who has been already preferred, and has already obtained it, may be\r\nallowed now also to offer himself for a candidate. He prefers your\r\npeace, and your living without sedition, to this honorable employment,\r\nalthough in truth it was with your approbation that he obtained it; for\r\nthough God were the donor, yet do we not offend when we think fit to\r\naccept it with your good-will; yet would it have been an instance of\r\nimpiety not to have taken that honorable employment when he offered it;\r\nnay, it had been exceedingly unreasonable, when God had thought fit any\r\none should have it for all time to come, and had made it secure and firm\r\nto him, to have refused it. However, he himself will judge again who it\r\nshall be whom he would have to offer sacrifices to him, and to have the\r\ndirection of matters of religion; for it is absurd that Corah, who is\r\nambitious of this honor, should deprive God of the power of giving it to\r\nwhom he pleases. Put an end, therefore, to your sedition and disturbance\r\non this account; and tomorrow morning do every one of you that desire\r\nthe priesthood bring a censer from home, and come hither with incense\r\nand fire: and do thou, O Corah, leave the judgment to God, and await to\r\nsee on which side he will give his determination upon this occasion, but\r\ndo not thou make thyself greater than God. Do thou also come, that this\r\ncontest about this honorable employment may receive determination. And I\r\nsuppose we may admit Aaron without offense, to offer himself to this\r\nscrutiny, since he is of the same lineage with thyself, and has done\r\nnothing in his priesthood that can be liable to exception. Come ye\r\ntherefore together, and offer your incense in public before all the\r\npeople; and when you offer it, he whose sacrifice God shall accept shall\r\nbe ordained to the priesthood, and shall be clear of the present calumny\r\non Aaron, as if I had granted him that favor because he was my brother.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How Those That Stirred Up This Sedition Were Destroyed,\r\nAccording To The Will Of God; And How Aaron, Moses's Brother Both He And\r\nHis Posterity, Retained The Priesthood.\r\n\r\n1. When Moses had said this, the multitude left off the turbulent\r\nbehavior they had indulged, and the suspicion they had of Moses, and\r\ncommended what he had said; for those proposals were good, and were so\r\nesteemed of the people. At that time therefore they dissolved the\r\nassembly. But on the next day they came to the congregation, in order to\r\nbe present at the sacrifice, and at the determination that was to be\r\nmade between the candidates for the priesthood. Now this congregation\r\nproved a turbulent one, and the multitude were in great suspense in\r\nexpectation of what was to be done; for some of them would have been\r\npleased if Moses had been convicted of evil practices, but the wiser\r\nsort desired that they might be delivered from the present disorder and\r\ndisturbance; for they were afraid, that if this sedition went on, the\r\ngood order of their settlement would rather be destroyed; but the whole\r\nbody of the people do naturally delight in clamors against their\r\ngovernors, and, by changing their opinions upon the harangues of every\r\nspeaker, disturb the public tranquillity. And now Moses sent messengers\r\nfor Abiram and Dathan, and ordered them to come to the assembly, and\r\nwait there for the holy offices that were to be performed. But they\r\nanswered the messenger, that they would not obey his summons; nay, would\r\nnot overlook Moses's behavior, who was growing too great for them by\r\nevil practices. Now when Moses heard of this their answer, he desired\r\nthe heads of the people to follow him, and he went to the faction of\r\nDathan, not thinking it any frightful thing at all to go to these\r\ninsolent people; so they made no opposition, but went along with him.\r\nBut Dathan, and his associates, when they understood that Moses and the\r\nprincipal of the people were coming to them, came out, with their wives\r\nand children, and stood before their tents, and looked to see what Moses\r\nwould do. They had also their servants about them to defend themselves,\r\nin case Moses should use force against them.\r\n\r\n2. But he came near, and lifted up his hands to heaven, and cried out\r\nwith a loud voice, in order to be heard by the whole multitude, and\r\nsaid, \"O Lord of the creatures that are in the heaven, in the earth, and\r\nin the sea; for thou art the most authentic witness to what I have done,\r\nthat it has all been done by thy appointment, and that it was thou that\r\naffordedst us assistance when we attempted any thing, and showedst mercy\r\non the Hebrews in all their distresses; do thou come now, and hear all\r\nthat I say, for no action or thought escapes thy knowledge; so that thou\r\nwilt not disdain to speak what is true, for my vindication, without any\r\nregard to the ungrateful imputations of these men. As for what was done\r\nbefore I was born, thou knowest best, as not learning them by report,\r\nbut seeing them, and being present with them when they were done; but\r\nfor what has been done of late, and which these men, although they know\r\nthem well enough, unjustly pretend to suspect, be thou my witness. When\r\nI lived a private quiet life, I left those good things which, by my own\r\ndiligence, and by thy counsel, I enjoyed with Raguel my father-in-law;\r\nand I gave myself up to this people, and underwent many miseries on\r\ntheir account. I also bore great labors at first, in order to obtain\r\nliberty for them, and now in order to their preservation; and have\r\nalways showed myself ready to assist them in every distress of theirs.\r\nNow, therefore, since I am suspected by those very men whose being is\r\nowing to my labors, come thou, as it is reasonable to hope thou wilt;\r\nthou, I say, who showedst me that fire at mount Sinai, and madest me to\r\nhear its voice, and to see the several wonders which that place afforded\r\nthou who commandedst me to go to Egypt, and declare thy will to this\r\npeople; thou who disturbest the happy estate of the Egyptians, and\r\ngavest us the opportunity of flying away from out under them, and madest\r\nthe dominion of Pharaoh inferior to my dominion; thou who didst make the\r\nsea dry land for us, when we knew not whither to go, and didst overwhelm\r\nthe Egyptians with those destructive waves which had been divided for\r\nus; thou who didst bestow upon us the security of weapons when we were\r\nnaked; thou who didst make the fountains that were corrupted to flow, so\r\nas to be fit for drinking, and didst furnish us with water that came out\r\nof the rocks, when we were in want of it; thou who didst preserve our\r\nlives with [quails, which was] food from the sea, when the fruits of the\r\nground failed us; thou didst send us such food from heaven as had never\r\nbeen seen before; thou who didst suggest to us the knowledge of thy\r\nlaws, and appoint to us a form of government,—come thou, I say, O Lord\r\nof the whole world, and that as such a Judge and a Witness to me as\r\ncannot be bribed, and show how I never admitted of any gift against\r\njustice from any of the Hebrews; and have never condemned a man that\r\nought to have been acquitted, on account of one that was rich; and have\r\nnever attempted to hurt this commonwealth. I am now and am suspected of\r\na thing the remotest from my intentions, as if I had given the\r\npreisthood to Aaron, not at thy command, but out own favor to him; do\r\nthou at this time demonstrate that all things are administered by thy\r\nprovidence and that nothing happens by chance, but is governed by thy\r\nwill, and thereby attains its end: as also demonstrate that thou takest\r\ncare that have done good to the Hebrews; demonstrate this, I say, by the\r\npunishment of Abiram and Dathan, who condemn thee as an insensible\r\nBeing, and one overcome by my contrivances. This thou do by inflicting\r\nsuch an open punishment on these men who so madly fly in the face of thy\r\nglory, as will take them out of the world, not in an manner, but so that\r\nit may appear they do die after the manner of other men: let that ground\r\nwhich they tread upon open about them and consume them, with their\r\nfamilies and goods. This will be a demonstration of thy power to all and\r\nthis method of their sufferings will be an instruction of wisdom for\r\nthose that entertain profane sentiments of thee. By this means I shall\r\nbe a good servant, in the precepts thou hast given by me. But if the\r\ncalumnies they have raised against me be true, mayst thou preserve these\r\nmen from every evil accident, and bring all that destruction on me which\r\nI have imprecated upon them. And when thou hast inflicted punishment on\r\nthose that have endeavored to deal unjustly with this people, bestow\r\nupon them concord and peace. Save this multitude that follow thy\r\ncommandments, and preserve them free from harm, and let them not partake\r\nof the punishment of those that have sinned; for thou knowest thyself it\r\nis not just, that for the wickedness of those men the whole body of the\r\nIsraelites should suffer punishment.\"\r\n\r\n3. When Moses had said this, with tears in his eyes, the ground was\r\nmoved on a sudden; and the agitation that set it in motion was like that\r\nwhich the wind produces in waves of the sea. The people were all\r\naffrighted; and the ground that was about their tents sunk down at the\r\ngreat noise, with a terrible sound, and carried whatsoever was dear to\r\nthe seditious into itself, who so entirely perished, that there was not\r\nthe least appearance that any man had ever been seen there, the earth\r\nthat had opened itself about them, closing again, and becoming entire as\r\nit was before, insomuch that such as saw it afterward did not perceive\r\nthat any such accident had happened to it. Thus did these men perish,\r\nand become a demonstration of the power of God. And truly, any one would\r\nlament them, not only on account of this calamity that befell them,\r\nwhich yet deserves our commiseration, but also because their kindred\r\nwere pleased with their sufferings; for they forgot the relation they\r\nbare to them, and at the sight of this sad accident approved of the\r\njudgment given against them; and because they looked upon the people\r\nabout Dathan as pestilent men, they thought they perished as such, and\r\ndid not grieve for them.\r\n\r\n4. And now Moses called for those that contended about the priesthood,\r\nthat trial might be made who should be priest, and that he whose\r\nsacrifice God was best pleased with might be ordained to that function.\r\nThere attended two hundred and fifty men, who indeed were honored by the\r\npeople, not only on account of the power of their ancestors, but also on\r\naccount of their own, in which they excelled the others: Aaron also and\r\nCorah came forth, and they all offered incense, in those censers of\r\ntheirs which they brought with them, before the tabernacle. Hereupon so\r\ngreat a fire shone out as no one ever saw in any that is made by the\r\nhand of man, neither in those eruptions out of the earth that are caused\r\nby subterraneous burn-rags, nor in such fires as arise of their own\r\naccord in the woods, when the agitation is caused by the trees rubbing\r\none against another: but this fire was very bright, and had a terrible\r\nflame, such as is kindled at the command of God; by whose irruption on\r\nthem, all the company, and Corah himself, were destroyed, 2 and this so\r\nentirely, that their very bodies left no remains behind them. Aaron\r\nalone was preserved, and not at all hurt by the fire, because it was God\r\nthat sent the fire to burn those only who ought to be burned. Hereupon\r\nMoses, after these men were destroyed, was desirous that the memory of\r\nthis judgment might be delivered down to posterity, and that future ages\r\nmight be acquainted with it; and so he commanded Eleazar, the son of\r\nAaron, to put their censers near the brazen altar, that they might be a\r\nmemorial to posterity of what these men suffered, for supposing that the\r\npower of God might be eluded. And thus Aaron was now no longer esteemed\r\nto have the priesthood by the favor of Moses, but by the public judgment\r\nof God; and thus he and his children peaceably enjoyed that honor\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. What Happened To The Hebrews During Thirty-Eight Years In The\r\nWilderness.\r\n\r\n1. However, this sedition was so far from ceasing upon this destruction,\r\nthat it grew much stronger, and became more intolerable. And the\r\noccasion of its growing worse was of that nature, as made it likely the\r\ncalamity would never cease, but last for a long time; for the men,\r\nbelieving already that nothing is done without the providence of God,\r\nwould have it that these things came thus to pass not without God's\r\nfavor to Moses; they therefore laid the blame upon him that God was so\r\nangry, and that this happened not so much because of the wickedness of\r\nthose that were punished, as because Moses procured the punishment; and\r\nthat these men had been destroyed without any sin of theirs, only\r\nbecause they were zealous about the Divine worship; as also, that he who\r\nhad been the cause of this diminution of the people, by destroying so\r\nmany men, and those the most excellent of them all, besides his escaping\r\nany punishment himself, had now given the priesthood to his brother so\r\nfirmly, that nobody could any longer dispute it with him; for no one\r\nelse, to be sure, could now put in for it, since he must have seen those\r\nthat first did so to have miserably perished. Nay, besides this, the\r\nkindred of those that were destroyed made great entreaties to the\r\nmultitude to abate the arrogance of Moses, because it would be safest\r\nfor them so to do.\r\n\r\n2. Now Moses, upon his hearing for a good while that the people were\r\ntumultuous, was afraid that they would attempt some other innovation,\r\nand that some great and sad calamity would be the consequence. He called\r\nthe multitude to a congregation, and patiently heard what apology they\r\nhad to make for themselves, without opposing them, and this lest he\r\nshould imbitter the multitude: he only desired the heads of the tribes\r\nto bring their rods, 3 with the names of their tribes inscribed upon\r\nthem, and that he should receive the priesthood in whose rod God should\r\ngive a sign. This was agreed to. So the rest brought their rods, as did\r\nAaron also, who had written the tribe of Levi on his rod. These rods\r\nMoses laid up in the tabernacle of God. On the next day he brought out\r\nthe rods, which were known from one another by those who brought them,\r\nthey having distinctly noted them, as had the multitude also; and as to\r\nthe rest, in the same form Moses had received them, in that they saw\r\nthem still; but they also saw buds and branches grown out of Aaron's\r\nrod, with ripe fruits upon them; they were almonds, the rod having been\r\ncut out of that tree. The people were so amazed at this strange sight,\r\nthat though Moses and Aaron were before under some degree of hatred,\r\nthey now laid that hatred aside, and began to admire the judgment of God\r\nconcerning them; so that hereafter they applauded what God had decreed,\r\nand permitted Aaron to enjoy the priesthood peaceably. And thus God\r\nordained him priest three several times, and he retained that honor\r\nwithout further disturbance. And hereby this sedition of the Hebrews,\r\nwhich had been a great one, and had lasted a great while, was at last\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\n3. And now Moses, because the tribe of Levi was made free from war and\r\nwarlike expeditions, and was set apart for the Divine worship, lest they\r\nshould want and seek after the necessaries of life, and so neglect the\r\ntemple, commanded the Hebrews, according to the will of God, that when\r\nthey should gain the possession of the land of Canaan, they should\r\nassign forty-eight good and fair cities to the Levites; and permit them\r\nto enjoy their suburbs, as far as the limit of two thousand cubits would\r\nextend from the walls of the city. And besides this, he appointed that\r\nthe people should pay the tithe of their annual fruits of the earth,\r\nboth to the Levites and to the priests. And this is what that tribe\r\nreceives of the multitude; but I think it necessary to set down what is\r\npaid by all, peculiarly to the priests.\r\n\r\n4. Accordingly he commanded the Levites to yield up to the priests\r\nthirteen of their forty-eight cities, and to set apart for them the\r\ntenth part of the tithes which they every year receive of the people; as\r\nalso, that it was but just to offer to God the first-fruits of the\r\nentire product of the ground; and that they should offer the first-born\r\nof those four-footed beasts that are appointed for sacrifices, if it be\r\na male, to the priests, to be slain, that they and their entire families\r\nmay eat them in the holy city; but that the owners of those first-born\r\nwhich are not appointed for sacrifices in the laws of our country,\r\nshould bring a shekel and a half in their stead: but for the first-born\r\nof a man, five shekels: that they should also have the first-fruits out\r\nof the shearing of the sheep; and that when any baked bread corn, and\r\nmade loaves of it, they should give somewhat of what they had baked to\r\nthem. Moreover, when any have made a sacred vow, I mean those that are\r\ncalled Nazarites, that suffer their hair to grow long, and use no wine,\r\nwhen they consecrate their hair, 4 and offer it for a sacrifice, they\r\nare to allot that hair for the priests [to be thrown into the fire].\r\nSuch also as dedicate themselves to God, as a corban, which denotes what\r\nthe Greeks call a gift, when they are desirous of being freed from that\r\nministration, are to lay down money for the priests; thirty shekels if\r\nit be a woman, and fifty if it be a man; but if any be too poor to pay\r\nthe appointed sum, it shall be lawful for the priests to determine that\r\nsum as they think fit. And if any slay beasts at home for a private\r\nfestival, but not for a religious one, they are obliged to bring the maw\r\nand the cheek, [or breast,] and the right shoulder of the sacrifice, to\r\nthe priests. With these Moses contrived that the priests should be\r\nplentifully maintained, besides what they had out of those offerings for\r\nsins which the people gave them, as I have set it down in the foregoing\r\nbook. He also ordered, that out of every thing allotted for the priests,\r\ntheir servants, [their sons,] their daughters, and their wives, should\r\npartake, as well as themselves, excepting what came to them out of the\r\nsacrifices that were offered for sins; for of those none but the males\r\nof the family of the priests might eat, and this in the temple also, and\r\nthat the same day they were offered.\r\n\r\n5. When Moses had made these constitutions, after the sedition was over,\r\nhe removed, together with the whole army, and came to the borders of\r\nIdumea. He then sent ambassadors to the king of the Idumeans, and\r\ndesired him to give him a passage through his country; and agreed to\r\nsend him what hostages he should desire, to secure him from an injury.\r\nHe desired him also, that he would allow his army liberty to buy\r\nprovisions; and, if he insisted upon it, he would pay down a price for\r\nthe very water they should drink. But the king was not pleased with this\r\nembassage from Moses: nor did he allow a passage for the army, but\r\nbrought his people armed to meet Moses, and to hinder them, in case they\r\nshould endeavor to force their passage. Upon which Moses consulted God\r\nby the oracle, who would not have him begin the war first; and so he\r\nwithdrew his forces, and traveled round about through the wilderness.\r\n\r\n6. Then it was that Miriam, the sister of Moses, came to her end, having\r\ncompleted her fortieth year 5 since she left Egypt, on the first 6 day\r\nof the lunar month Xanthicus. They then made a public funeral for her,\r\nat a great expense. She was buried upon a certain mountain, which they\r\ncall Sin: and when they had mourned for her thirty days, Moses purified\r\nthe people after this manner: He brought a heifer that had never been\r\nused to the plough or to husbandry, that was complete in all its parts,\r\nand entirely of a red color, at a little distance from the camp, into a\r\nplace perfectly clean. This heifer was slain by the high priest, and her\r\nblood sprinkled with his finger seven times before the tabernacle of\r\nGod; after this, the entire heifer was burnt in that state, together\r\nwith its skin and entrails; and they threw cedar-wood, and hyssop, and\r\nscarlet wool, into the midst of the fire; then a clean man gathered all\r\nher ashes together, and laid them in a place perfectly clean. When\r\ntherefore any persons were defiled by a dead body, they put a little of\r\nthese ashes into spring water, with hyssop, and, dipping part of these\r\nashes in it, they sprinkled them with it, both on the third day, and on\r\nthe seventh, and after that they were clean. This he enjoined them to do\r\nalso when the tribes should come into their own land.\r\n\r\n7. Now when this purification, which their leader made upon the mourning\r\nfor his sister, as it has been now described, was over, he caused the\r\narmy to remove and to march through the wilderness and through Arabia;\r\nand when he came to a place which the Arabians esteem their metropolis,\r\nwhich was formerly called Arce, but has now the name of Petra, at this\r\nplace, which was encompassed with high mountains, Aaron went up one of\r\nthem in the sight of the whole army, Moses having before told him that\r\nhe was to die, for this place was over against them. He put off his\r\npontifical garments, and delivered them to Eleazar his son, to whom the\r\nhigh priesthood belonged, because he was the elder brother; and died\r\nwhile the multitude looked upon him. He died in the same year wherein he\r\nlost his sister, having lived in all a hundred twenty and three years.\r\nHe died on the first day of that lunar month which is called by the\r\nAthenians Hecatombaeon, by the Macedonians Lous, but by the Hebrews\r\nAbba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How Moses Conquered Sihon And Og Kings Of The Amorites, And\r\nDestroyed Their Whole Army And Then Divided Their Land By Lot To Two\r\nTribes And A Half Of The Hebrews.\r\n\r\n1. The people mourned for Aaron thirty days, and when this mourning was\r\nover, Moses removed the army from that place, and came to the river\r\nArnon, which, issuing out of the mountains of Arabia, and running\r\nthrough all that wilderness, falls into the lake Asphaltitis, and\r\nbecomes the limit between the land of the Moabites and the land of the\r\nAmorites. This land is fruitful, and sufficient to maintain a great\r\nnumber of men, with the good things it produces. Moses therefore sent\r\nmessengers to Sihon, the king of this country, desiring that he would\r\ngrant his army a passage, upon what security he should please to\r\nrequire; he promised that he should be no way injured, neither as to\r\nthat country which Sihon governed, nor as to its inhabitants; and that\r\nhe would buy his provisions at such a price as should be to their\r\nadvantage, even though he should desire to sell them their very water.\r\nBut Sihon refused his offer, and put his army into battle array, and was\r\npreparing every thing in order to hinder their passing over Arnon.\r\n\r\n2. When Moses saw that the Amorite king was disposed to enter upon\r\nhostilities with them, he thought he ought not to bear that insult; and,\r\ndetermining to wean the Hebrews from their indolent temper, and prevent\r\nthe disorders which arose thence, which had been the occasion of their\r\nformer sedition, [nor indeed were they now thoroughly easy in their\r\nminds,] he inquired of God, whether he would give him leave to fight?\r\nwhich when he had done, and God also promised him the victory, he was\r\nhimself very courageous, and ready to proceed to fighting. Accordingly\r\nhe encouraged the soldiers; and he desired of them that they would take\r\nthe pleasure of fighting, now God gave them leave so to do. They then,\r\nupon the receipt of this permission, which they so much longed for, put\r\non their whole armor, and set about the work without delay. But the\r\nAmorite king was not now like to himself when the Hebrews were ready to\r\nattack him; but both he himself was affrighted at the Hebrews, and his\r\narmy, which before had showed themselves to be of good courage, were\r\nthen found to be timorous: so they could not sustain the first onset,\r\nnor bear up against the Hebrews, but fled away, as thinking this would\r\nafford them a more likely way for their escape than fighting, for they\r\ndepended upon their cities, which were strong, from which yet they\r\nreaped no advantage when they were forced to fly to them; for as soon as\r\nthe Hebrews saw them giving ground, they immediately pursued them close;\r\nand when they had broken their ranks, they greatly terrified them, and\r\nsome of them broke off from the rest, and ran away to the cities. Now\r\nthe Hebrews pursued them briskly, and obstinately persevered in the\r\nlabors they had already undergone; and being very skillful in slinging,\r\nand very dexterous in throwing of darts, or any thing else of that kind,\r\nand also having nothing but light armor, which made them quick in the\r\npursuit, they overtook their enemies; and for those that were most\r\nremote, and could not be overtaken, they reached them by their slings\r\nand their bows, so that many were slain; and those that escaped the\r\nslaughter were sorely wounded, and these were more distressed with\r\nthirst than with any of those that fought against them, for it was the\r\nsummer season; and when the greatest number of them were brought down to\r\nthe river out of a desire to drink, as also when others fled away by\r\ntroops, the Hebrews came round them, and shot at them; so that, what\r\nwith darts and what with arrows, they made a slaughter of them all.\r\nSihon their king was also slain. So the Hebrews spoiled the dead bodies,\r\nand took their prey. The land also which they took was full of abundance\r\nof fruits, and the army went all over it without fear, and fed their\r\ncattle upon it; and they took the enemies prisoners, for they could no\r\nway put a stop to them, since all the fighting men were destroyed. Such\r\nwas the destruction which overtook the Amorites, who were neither\r\nsagacious in counsel, nor courageous in action. Hereupon the Hebrews\r\ntook possession of their land, which is a country situate between three\r\nrivers, and naturally resembled an island: the river Arnon being its\r\nsouthern; the river Jabbok determining its northern side, which running\r\ninto Jordan loses its own name, and takes the other; while Jordan itself\r\nruns along by it, on its western coast.\r\n\r\n3. When matters were come to this state, Og, the king of Gilead and\r\nGaulanitis, fell upon the Israelites. He brought an army with him, and\r\nin haste to the assistance of his friend Sihon: but though he found him\r\nalready slain, yet did he resolve still to come and fight the Hebrews,\r\nsupposing he should be too hard for them, and being desirous to try\r\ntheir valor; but failing of his hope, he was both himself slain in the\r\nbattle, and all his army was destroyed. So Moses passed over the river\r\nJabbok, and overran the kingdom of Og. He overthrew their cities, and\r\nslew all their inhabitants, who yet exceeded in riches all the men in\r\nthat part of the continent, on account of the goodness of the soil, and\r\nthe great quantity of their wealth. Now Og had very few equals, either\r\nin the largeness of his body, or handsomeness of his appearance. He was\r\nalso a man of great activity in the use of his hands, so that his\r\nactions were not unequal to the vast largeness and handsome appearance\r\nof his body. And men could easily guess at his strength and magnitude\r\nwhen they took his bed at Rabbath, the royal city of the Ammonites; its\r\nstructure was of iron, its breadth four cubits, and its length a cubit\r\nmore than double thereto. However, his fall did not only improve the\r\ncircumstances of the Hebrews for the present, but by his death he was\r\nthe occasion of further good success to them; for they presently took\r\nthose sixty cities, which were encompassed with excellent walls, and had\r\nbeen subject to him, and all got both in general and in particular a\r\ngreat prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. Concerning Balaam The Prophet And What Kind Of Man He Was.\r\n\r\n1. Now Moses, when he had brought his army to Jordan; pitched his camp\r\nin the great plain over against Jericho. This city is a very happy\r\nsituation, and very fit for producing palm-trees and balsam. And now the\r\nIsraelites began to be very proud of themselves, and were very eager for\r\nfighting. Moses then, after he had offered for a few days sacrifices of\r\nthanksgiving to God, and feasted the people, sent a party of armed men\r\nto lay waste the country of the Midianites, and to take their cities.\r\nNow the occasion which he took for making war upon them was this that\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n2. When Balak, the king of the Moabites, who had from his ancestors a\r\nfriendship and league with the Midianites, saw how great the Israelites\r\nwere grown, he was much affrighted on account of his own and his\r\nkingdom's danger; for he was not acquainted with this, that the Hebrews\r\nwould not meddle with any other country, but were to be contented with\r\nthe possession of the land of Canaan, God having forbidden them to go\r\nany farther 7 So he, with more haste than wisdom, resolved to make an\r\nattempt upon them by words; but he did not judge it prudent to fight\r\nagainst them, after they had such prosperous successes, and even became\r\nout of ill successes more happy than before, but he thought to hinder\r\nthem, if he could, from growing greater, and so he resolved to send\r\nambassadors to the Midianites about them. Now these Midianites knowing\r\nthere was one Balaam, who lived by Euphrates, and was the greatest of\r\nthe prophets at that time, and one that was in friendship with them,\r\nsent some of their honorable princes along with the ambassadors of\r\nBalak, to entreat the prophet to come to them, that he might imprecate\r\ncurses to the destruction of the Israelites. So Balaam received the\r\nambassadors, and treated them very kindly; and when he had supped, he\r\ninquired what was God's will, and what this matter was for which the\r\nMidianites entreated him to come to them. But when God opposed his\r\ngoing, he came to the ambassadors, and told them that he was himself\r\nvery willing and desirous to comply with their request, but informed\r\nthem that God was opposite to his intentions, even that God who had\r\nraised him to great reputation on account of the truth of his\r\npredictions; for that this army, which they entreated him to come and\r\ncurse, was in the favor of God; on which account he advised them to go\r\nhome again, and not to persist in their enmity against the Israelites;\r\nand when he had given them that answer, he dismissed the ambassadors.\r\n\r\n3. Now the Midianites, at the earnest request and fervent entreaties of\r\nBalak, sent other ambassadors to Balaam, who, desiring to gratify the\r\nmen, inquired again of God; but he was displeased at [second] trial 8\r\nand bid him by no means to contradict the ambassadors. Now Balaam did\r\nnot imagine that God gave this injunction in order to deceive him, so he\r\nwent along with the ambassadors; but when the divine angel met him in\r\nthe way, when he was in a narrow passage, and hedged in with a wall on\r\nboth sides, the ass on which Balaam rode understood that it was a divine\r\nspirit that met him, and thrust Balaam to one of the walls, without\r\nregard to the stripes which Balaam, when he was hurt by the wall, gave\r\nher; but when the ass, upon the angel's continuing to distress her, and\r\nupon the stripes which were given her, fell down, by the will of God,\r\nshe made use of the voice of a man, and complained of Balaam as acting\r\nunjustly to her; that whereas he had no fault to find with her in her\r\nformer service to him, he now inflicted stripes upon her, as not\r\nunderstanding that she was hindered from serving him in what he was now\r\ngoing about, by the providence of God. And when he was disturbed by\r\nreason of the voice of the ass, which was that of a man, the angel\r\nplainly appeared to him, and blamed him for the stripes he had given his\r\nass; and informed him that the brute creature was not in fault, but that\r\nhe was himself come to obstruct his journey, as being contrary to the\r\nwill of God. Upon which Balaam was afraid, and was preparing to return\r\nback again: yet did God excite him to go on his intended journey, but\r\nadded this injunction, that he should declare nothing but what he\r\nhimself should suggest to his mind.\r\n\r\n4. When God had given him this charge, he came to Balak; and when the\r\nking had entertained him in a magnificent manner, he desired him to go\r\nto one of the mountains to take a view of the state of the camp of the\r\nHebrews. Balak himself also came to the mountain, and brought the\r\nprophet along with him, with a royal attendance. This mountain lay over\r\ntheir heads, and was distant sixty furlongs from the camp. Now when he\r\nsaw them, he desired the king to build him seven altars, and to bring\r\nhim as many bulls and rams; to which desire the king did presently\r\nconform. He then slew the sacrifices, and offered them as burnt-\r\nofferings, that he might observe some signal of the flight of the\r\nHebrews. Then said he, \"Happy is this people, on whom God bestows the\r\npossession of innumerable good things, and grants them his own\r\nprovidence to be their assistant and their guide; so that there is not\r\nany nation among mankind but you will be esteemed superior to them in\r\nvirtue, and in the earnest prosecution of the best rules of life, and of\r\nsuch as are pure from wickedness, and will leave those rules to your\r\nexcellent children; and this out of the regard that God bears to you,\r\nand the provision of such things for you as may render you happier than\r\nany other people under the sun. You shall retain that land to which he\r\nhath sent you, and it shall ever be under the command of your children;\r\nand both all the earth, as well as the seas, shall be filled with your\r\nglory: and you shall be sufficiently numerous to supply the world in\r\ngeneral, and every region of it in particular, with inhabitants out of\r\nyour stock. However, O blessed army! wonder that you are become so many\r\nfrom one father: and truly, the land of Canaan can now hold you, as\r\nbeing yet comparatively few; but know ye that the whole world is\r\nproposed to be your place of habitation for ever. The multitude of your\r\nposterity also shall live as well in the islands as on the continent,\r\nand that more in number than are the stars of heaven. And when you are\r\nbecome so many, God will not relinquish the care of you, but will afford\r\nyou an abundance of all good things in times of peace, with victory and\r\ndominion in times of war. May the children of your enemies have an\r\ninclination to fight against you; and may they be so hardy as to come to\r\narms, and to assault you in battle, for they will not return with\r\nvictory, nor will their return be agreeable to their children and wives.\r\nTo so great a degree of valor will you be raised by the providence of\r\nGod, who is able to diminish the affluence of some, and to supply the\r\nwants of others.\"\r\n\r\n5. Thus did Balaam speak by inspiration, as not being in his own power,\r\nbut moved to say what he did by the Divine Spirit. But then Balak was\r\ndispleased, and said he had broken the contract he had made, whereby he\r\nwas to come, as he and his confederates had invited him, by the promise\r\nof great presents: for whereas he came to curse their enemies, he had\r\nmade an encomium upon them, and had declared that they were the happiest\r\nof men. To which Balaam replied, \"O Balak, if thou rightly considerest\r\nthis whole matter, canst thou suppose that it is in our power to be\r\nsilent, or to say any thing, when the Spirit of God seizes upon us?—for\r\nhe puts such words as he pleases in our mouths, and such discourses as\r\nwe are not ourselves conscious of. I well remember by what entreaties\r\nboth you and the Midianites so joyfully brought me hither, and on that\r\naccount I took this journey. It was my prayer, that I might not put any\r\naffront upon you, as to what you desired of me; but God is more powerful\r\nthan the purposes I had made to serve you; for those that take upon them\r\nto foretell the affairs of mankind, as from their own abilities, are\r\nentirely unable to do it, or to forbear to utter what God suggests to\r\nthem, or to offer violence to his will; for when he prevents us and\r\nenters into us, nothing that we say is our own. I then did not intend to\r\npraise this army, nor to go over the several good things which God\r\nintended to do to their race; but since he was so favorable to them, and\r\nso ready to bestow upon them a happy life and eternal glory, he\r\nsuggested the declaration of those things to me: but now, because it is\r\nmy desire to oblige thee thyself, as well as the Midianites, whose\r\nentreaties it is not decent for me to reject, go to, let us again rear\r\nother altars, and offer the like sacrifices that we did before, that I\r\nmay see whether I can persuade God to permit me to bind these men with\r\ncurses.\" Which, when Balak had agreed to, God would not, even upon\r\nsecond sacrifices, consent to his cursing the Israelites. 9 Then fell\r\nBalaam upon his face, and foretold what calamities would befall the\r\nseveral kings of the nations, and the most eminent cities, some of which\r\nof old were not so much as inhabited; which events have come to pass\r\namong the several people concerned, both in the foregoing ages, and in\r\nthis, till my own memory, both by sea and by land. From which completion\r\nof all these predictions that he made, one may easily guess that the\r\nrest will have their completion in time to come.\r\n\r\n6. But Balak being very angry that the Israelites were not cursed, sent\r\naway Balaam without thinking him worthy of any honor. Whereupon, when he\r\nwas just upon his journey, in order to pass the Euphrates, he sent for\r\nBalak, and for the princes of the Midianites, and spake thus to them:—\"O\r\nBalak, and you Midianites that are here present, [for I am obliged even\r\nwithout the will of God to gratify you,] it is true no entire\r\ndestruction can seize upon the nation of the Hebrews, neither by war,\r\nnor by plague, nor by scarcity of the fruits of the earth, nor can any\r\nother unexpected accident be their entire ruin; for the providence of\r\nGod is concerned to preserve them from such a misfortune; nor will it\r\npermit any such calamity to come upon them whereby they may all perish;\r\nbut some small misfortunes, and those for a short time, whereby they may\r\nappear to be brought low, may still befall them; but after that they\r\nwill flourish again, to the terror of those that brought those mischiefs\r\nupon them. So that if you have a mind to gain a victory over them for a\r\nshort space of time, you will obtain it by following my directions:—Do\r\nyou therefore set out the handsomest of such of your daughters as are\r\nmost eminent for beauty, 10 and proper to force and conquer the modesty\r\nof those that behold them, and these decked and trimmed to the highest\r\ndegree able. Then do you send them to be near camp, and give them in\r\ncharge, that the young men of the Hebrews desire their allow it them;\r\nand when they see they are enamored of them, let them take leaves; and\r\nif they entreat them to stay, let give their consent till they have\r\npersuaded leave off their obedience to their own laws, the worship of\r\nthat God who established them to worship the gods of the Midianites and\r\nfor by this means God will be angry at them 11.\" Accordingly, when\r\nBalaam had suggested counsel to them, he went his way.\r\n\r\n7. So when the Midianites had sent their daughters, as Balaam had\r\nexhorted them, the Hebrew men were allured by their beauty, and came\r\nwith them, and besought them not to grudge them the enjoyment of their\r\nbeauty, nor to deny them their conversation. These daughters of\r\nMidianites received their words gladly, and consented to it, and staid\r\nwith them; but when they brought them to be enamored of them, and their\r\ninclinations to them were grown to ripeness, they began to think of\r\ndeparting from them: then it was that these men became greatly\r\ndisconsolate at the women's departure, and they were urgent with them\r\nnot to leave them, but begged they would continue there, and become\r\ntheir wives; and they promised them they should be owned as mistresses\r\nall they had. This they said with an oath, and called God for the\r\narbitrator of what they promised; and this with tears in their eyes, and\r\nall such marks of concern, as might shew how miserable they thought\r\nthemselves without them, and so might move their compassion for them. So\r\nthe women, as soon as they perceived they had made their slaves, and had\r\ncaught them with their conservation began to speak thus to them:—\r\n\r\n8. \"O you illustrious young men! we have of our own at home, and great\r\nplenty of good things there, together with the natural, affectionate\r\nparents and friends; nor is it out of our want of any such things that\r\nwe came to discourse with you; nor did we admit of your invitation with\r\ndesign to prostitute the beauty of our bodies for gain; but taking you\r\nfor brave and worthy men, we agreed to your request, that we might treat\r\nyou with such honors as hospitality required: and now seeing you say\r\nthat you have a great affection for us, and are troubled when you think\r\nwe are departing, we are not averse to your entreaties; and if we may\r\nreceive such assurance of your good-will as we think can be alone\r\nsufficient, we will be glad to lead our lives with you as your wives;\r\nbut we are afraid that you will in time be weary of our company, and\r\nwill then abuse us, and send us back to our parents, after an\r\nignominious manner.\" And they desired that they would excuse them in\r\ntheir guarding against that danger. But the young men professed they\r\nwould give them any assurance they should desire; nor did they at all\r\ncontradict what they requested, so great was the passion they had for\r\nthem. \"If then,\" said they, \"this be your resolution, since you make use\r\nof such customs and conduct of life as are entirely different from all\r\nother men, 12 insomuch that your kinds of food are peculiar to\r\nyourselves, and your kinds of drink not common to others, it will be\r\nabsolutely necessary, if you would have us for your wives, that you do\r\nwithal worship our gods. Nor can there be any other demonstration of the\r\nkindness which you say you already have, and promise to have hereafter\r\nto us, than this, that you worship the same gods that we do. For has any\r\none reason to complain, that now you are come into this country, you\r\nshould worship the proper gods of the same country? especially while our\r\ngods are common to all men, and yours such as belong to nobody else but\r\nyourselves.\" So they said they must either come into such methods of\r\ndivine worship as all others came into, or else they must look out for\r\nanother world, wherein they may live by themselves, according to their\r\nown laws.\r\n\r\n9. Now the young men were induced by the fondness they had for these\r\nwomen to think they spake very well; so they gave themselves up to what\r\nthey persuaded them, and transgressed their own laws, and supposing\r\nthere were many gods, and resolving that they would sacrifice to them\r\naccording to the laws of that country which ordained them, they both\r\nwere delighted with their strange food, and went on to do every thing\r\nthat the women would have them do, though in contradiction to their own\r\nlaws; so far indeed that this transgression was already gone through the\r\nwhole army of the young men, and they fell into a sedition that was much\r\nworse than the former, and into danger of the entire abolition of their\r\nown institutions; for when once the youth had tasted of these strange\r\ncustoms, they went with insatiable inclinations into them; and even\r\nwhere some of the principal men were illustrious on account of the\r\nvirtues of their fathers, they also were corrupted together with the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n10. Even Zimri, the head of the tribe of Simeon accompanied with Cozbi,\r\na Midianitish women, who was the daughter of Sur, a man of authority in\r\nthat country; and being desired by his wife to disregard the laws of\r\nMoses, and to follow those she was used to, he complied with her, and\r\nthis both by sacrificing after a manner different from his own, and by\r\ntaking a stranger to wife. When things were thus, Moses was afraid that\r\nmatters should grow worse, and called the people to a congregation, but\r\nthen accused nobody by name, as unwilling to drive those into despair\r\nwho, by lying concealed, might come to repentance; but he said that they\r\ndid not do what was either worthy of themselves, or of their fathers, by\r\npreferring pleasure to God, and to the living according to his will;\r\nthat it was fit they should change their courses while their affairs\r\nwere still in a good state, and think that to be true fortitude which\r\noffers not violence to their laws, but that which resists their lusts.\r\nAnd besides that, he said it was not a reasonable thing, when they had\r\nlived soberly in the wilderness, to act madly now when they were in\r\nprosperity; and that they ought not to lose, now they have abundance,\r\nwhat they had gained when they had little:— and so did he endeavor, by\r\nsaying this, to correct the young inert, and to bring them to repentance\r\nfor what they had done.\r\n\r\n11. But Zimri arose up after him, and said, \"Yes, indeed, Moses, thou\r\nart at liberty to make use of such laws as thou art so fond of, and\r\nhast, by accustoming thyself to them, made them firm; otherwise, if\r\nthings had not been thus, thou hadst often been punished before now, and\r\nhadst known that the Hebrews are not easily put upon; but thou shalt not\r\nhave me one of thy followers in thy tyrannical commands, for thou dost\r\nnothing else hitherto, but, under pretense of laws, and of God, wickedly\r\nimpose on us slavery, and gain dominion to thyself, while thou deprivest\r\nus of the sweetness of life, which consists in acting according to our\r\nown wills, and is the right of free-men, and of those that have no lord\r\nover them. Nay, indeed, this man is harder upon the Hebrews then were\r\nthe Egyptians themselves, as pretending to punish, according to his\r\nlaws, every one's acting what is most agreeable to himself; but thou\r\nthyself better deservest to suffer punishment, who presumest to abolish\r\nwhat every one acknowledges to be what is good for him, and aimest to\r\nmake thy single opinion to have more force than that of all the rest;\r\nand what I now do, and think to be right, I shall not hereafter deny to\r\nbe according to my own sentiments. I have married, as thou sayest\r\nrightly, a strange woman, and thou hearest what I do from myself as from\r\none that is free, for truly I did not intend to conceal myself. I also\r\nown that I sacrificed to those gods to whom you do not think it fit to\r\nsacrifice; and I think it right to come at truth by inquiring of many\r\npeople, and not like one that lives under tyranny, to suffer the whole\r\nhope of my life to depend upon one man; nor shall any one find cause to\r\nrejoice who declares himself to have more authority over my actions than\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n12. Now when Zimri had said these things, about what he and some others\r\nhad wickedly done, the people held their peace, both out of fear of what\r\nmight come upon them, and because they saw that their legislator was not\r\nwilling to bring his insolence before the public any further, or openly\r\nto contend with him; for he avoided that, lest many should imitate the\r\nimpudence of his language, and thereby disturb the multitude. Upon this\r\nthe assembly was dissolved. However, the mischievous attempt had\r\nproceeded further, if Zimri had not been first slain, which came to pass\r\non the following occasion:—Phineas, a man in other respects better than\r\nthe rest of the young men, and also one that surpassed his\r\ncontemporaries in the dignity of his father, [for he was the son of\r\nEleazar the high priest, and the grandson of [Aaron] Moses's brother,]\r\nwho was greatly troubled at what was done by Zimri, he resolved in\r\nearnest to inflict punishment on him, before his unworthy behavior\r\nshould grow stronger by impunity, and in order to prevent this\r\ntransgression from proceeding further, which would happen if the\r\nringleaders were not punished. He was of so great magnanimity, both in\r\nstrength of mind and body, that when he undertook any very dangerous\r\nattempt, he did not leave it off till he overcame it, and got an entire\r\nvictory. So he came into Zimri's tent, and slew him with his javelin,\r\nand with it he slew Cozbi also, Upon which all those young men that had\r\na regard to virtue, and aimed to do a glorious action, imitated\r\nPhineas's boldness, and slew those that were found to be guilty of the\r\nsame crime with Zimri. Accordingly many of those that had transgressed\r\nperished by the magnanimous valor of these young men; and the rest all\r\nperished by a plague, which distemper God himself inflicted upon them;\r\nso that all those their kindred, who, instead of hindering them from\r\nsuch wicked actions, as they ought to have done, had persuaded them to\r\ngo on, were esteemed by God as partners in their wickedness, and died.\r\nAccordingly there perished out of the army no fewer than fourteen 13\r\n[twenty-four] thousand at this time.\r\n\r\n13. This was the cause why Moses was provoked to send an army to destroy\r\nthe Midianites, concerning which expedition we shall speak presently,\r\nwhen we have first related what we have omitted; for it is but just not\r\nto pass over our legislator's due encomium, on account of his conduct\r\nhere, because, although this Balaam, who was sent for by the Midianites\r\nto curse the Hebrews, and when he was hindered from doing it by Divine\r\nProvidence, did still suggest that advice to them, by making use of\r\nwhich our enemies had well nigh corrupted the whole multitude of the\r\nHebrews with their wiles, till some of them were deeply infected with\r\ntheir opinions; yet did he do him great honor, by setting down his\r\nprophecies in writing. And while it was in his power to claim this glory\r\nto himself, and make men believe they were his own predictions, there\r\nbeing no one that could be a witness against him, and accuse him for so\r\ndoing, he still gave his attestation to him, and did him the honor to\r\nmake mention of him on this account. But let every one think of these\r\nmatters as he pleases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How The Hebrews Fought With The Midianites, And Overcame\r\nThem.\r\n\r\n1. Now Moses sent an army against the land of Midian, for the causes\r\nforementioned, in all twelve thousand, taking an equal number out of\r\nevery tribe, and appointed Phineas for their commander; of which Phineas\r\nwe made mention a little before, as he that had guarded the laws of the\r\nHebrews, and had inflicted punishment on Zimri when he had transgressed\r\nthem. Now the Midianites perceived beforehand how the Hebrews were\r\ncoming, and would suddenly be upon them: so they assembled their army\r\ntogether, and fortified the entrances into their country, and there\r\nawaited the enemy's coming. When they were come, and they had joined\r\nbattle with them, an immense multitude of the Midianites fell; nor could\r\nthey be numbered, they were so very many: and among them fell all their\r\nkings, five in number, viz. Evi, Zur, Reba, Hur, and Rekem, who was of\r\nthe same name with a city, the chief and capital of all Arabia, which is\r\nstill now so called by the whole Arabian nation, Arecem, from the name\r\nof the king that built it; but is by the Greeks called—Petra. Now when\r\nthe enemies were discomfited, the Hebrews spoiled their country, and\r\ntook a great prey, and destroyed the men that were its inhabitants,\r\ntogether with the women; only they let the virgins alone, as Moses had\r\ncommanded Phineas to do, who indeed came back, bringing with him an army\r\nthat had received no harm, and a great deal of prey; fifty-two thousand\r\nbeeves, seventy-five thousand six hundred sheep, sixty thousand asses,\r\nwith an immense quantity of gold and silver furniture, which the\r\nMidianites made use of in their houses; for they were so wealthy, that\r\nthey were very luxurious. There were also led captive about thirty-two\r\nthousand virgins. 14 So Moses parted the prey into parts, and gave one\r\nfiftieth part to Eleazar and the two priests, and another fiftieth part\r\nto the Levites; and distributed the rest of the prey among the people.\r\nAfter which they lived happily, as having obtained an abundance of good\r\nthings by their valor, and there being no misfortune that attended them,\r\nor hindered their enjoyment of that happiness.\r\n\r\n2. But Moses was now grown old, and appointed Joshua for his successor,\r\nboth to receive directions from God as a prophet, and for a commander of\r\nthe army, if they should at any time stand in need of such a one; and\r\nthis was done by the command of God, that to him the care of the public\r\nshould be committed. Now Joshua had been instructed in all those kinds\r\nof learning which concerned the laws and God himself, and Moses had been\r\nhis instructor.\r\n\r\n3. At this time it was that the two tribes of Gad and Reuben, and the\r\nhalf tribe of Manasseh, abounded in a multitude of cattle, as well as in\r\nall other kinds of prosperity; whence they had a meeting, and in a body\r\ncame and besought Moses to give them, as their peculiar portion, that\r\nland of the Amorites which they had taken by right of war, because it\r\nwas fruitful, and good for feeding of cattle; but Moses, supposing that\r\nthey were afraid of fighting with the Canaanites, and invented this\r\nprovision for their cattle as a handsome excuse for avoiding that war,\r\nhe called them arrant cowards, and said they had only contrived a decent\r\nexcuse for that cowardice; and that they had a mind to live in luxury\r\nand ease, while all the rest were laboring with great pains to obtain\r\nthe land they were desirous to have; and that they were not willing to\r\nmarch along, and undergo the remaining hard service, whereby they were,\r\nunder the Divine promise, to pass over Jordan, and overcome those our\r\nenemies which God had shown them, and so obtain their land. But these\r\ntribes, when they saw that Moses was angry with them, and when they\r\ncould not deny but he had a just cause to be displeased at their\r\npetition, made an apology for themselves; and said, that it was not on\r\naccount of their fear of dangers, nor on account of their laziness, that\r\nthey made this request to him, but that they might leave the prey they\r\nhad gotten in places of safety, and thereby might be more expedite, and\r\nready to undergo difficulties, and to fight battles. They added this\r\nalso, that when they had built cities, wherein they might preserve their\r\nchildren, and wives, and possessions, if he would bestow them upon them,\r\nthey would go along with the rest of the army. Hereupon Moses was\r\npleased with what they said; so he called for Eleazar the high priest,\r\nand Joshua, and the chief of the tribes, and permitted these tribes to\r\npossess the land of the Amorites; but upon this condition, that they\r\nshould join with their kinsmen in the war until all things were settled.\r\nUpon which condition they took possession of the country, and built them\r\nstrong cities, and put into them their children and their wives, and\r\nwhatsoever else they had that might be an impediment to the labors of\r\ntheir future marches.\r\n\r\n4. Moses also now built those ten cities which were to be of the number\r\nof the forty-eight [for the Levites;]; three of which he allotted to\r\nthose that slew any person involuntarily, and fled to them; and he\r\nassigned the same time for their banishment with that of the life of\r\nthat high priest under whom the slaughter and flight happened; after\r\nwhich death of the high priest he permitted the slayer to return home.\r\nDuring the time of his exile, the relations of him that was slain may,\r\nby this law, kill the manslayer, if they caught him without the bounds\r\nof the city to which he fled, though this permission was not granted to\r\nany other person. Now the cities which were set apart for this flight\r\nwere these: Bezer, at the borders of Arabia; Ramoth, of the land of\r\nGilead; and Golan, in the land of Bashan. There were to be also, by\r\nMoses's command, three other cities allotted for the habitation of these\r\nfugitives out of the cities of the Levites, but not till after they\r\nshould be in possession of the land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n5. At this time the chief men of the tribe of Manasseh came to Moses,\r\nand informed him that there was an eminent man of their tribe dead,\r\nwhose name was Zelophehad, who left no male children, but left\r\ndaughters; and asked him whether these daughters might inherit his land\r\nor not. He made this answer, That if they shall marry into their own\r\ntribe, they shall carry their estate along with them; but if they\r\ndispose of themselves in marriage to men of another tribe, they shall\r\nleave their inheritance in their father's tribe. And then it was that\r\nMoses ordained, that every one's inheritance should continue in his own\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. The Polity Settled By Moses; And How He Disappeared From\r\nAmong Mankind.\r\n\r\n1. When forty years were completed, within thirty days, Moses gathered\r\nthe congregation together near Jordan, where the city Abila now stands,\r\na place full of palm-trees; and all the people being come together, he\r\nspake thus to them:—\r\n\r\n2. \"O you Israelites and fellow soldiers, who have been partners with me\r\nin this long and uneasy journey; since it is now the will of God, and\r\nthe course of old age, at a hundred and twenty, requires it that I\r\nshould depart out of this life; and since God has forbidden me to be a\r\npatron or an assistant to you in what remains to be done beyond Jordan;\r\nI thought it reasonable not to leave off my endeavors even now for your\r\nhappiness, but to do my utmost to procure for you the eternal enjoyment\r\nof good things, and a memorial for myself, when you shall be in the\r\nfruition of great plenty and prosperity. Come, therefore, let me suggest\r\nto you by what means you may be happy, and may leave an eternal\r\nprosperous possession thereof to your children after you, and then let\r\nme thus go out of the world; and I cannot but deserve to be believed by\r\nyou, both on account of the great things I have already done for you,\r\nand because, when souls are about to leave the body, they speak with the\r\nsincerest freedom. O children of Israel! there is but one source of\r\nhappiness for all mankind, the favor of God 15 for he alone is able to\r\ngive good things to those that deserve them, and to deprive those of\r\nthem that sin against him; towards whom, if you behave yourselves\r\naccording to his will, and according to what I, who well understand his\r\nmind, do exhort you to, you will both be esteemed blessed, and will be\r\nadmired by all men; and will never come into misfortunes, nor cease to\r\nbe happy: you will then preserve the possession of the good things you\r\nalready have, and will quickly obtain those that you are at present in\r\nwant of,—only do you be obedient to those whom God would have you to\r\nfollow. Nor do you prefer any other constitution of government before\r\nthe laws now given you; neither do you disregard that way of Divine\r\nworship which you now have, nor change it for any other form: and if you\r\ndo this, you will be the most courageous of all men, in undergoing the\r\nfatigues of war, and will not be easily conquered by any of your\r\nenemies; for while God is present with you to assist you, it is to be\r\nexpected that you will be able to despise the opposition of all mankind;\r\nand great rewards of virtue are proposed for you, if you preserve that\r\nvirtue through your whole lives. Virtue itself is indeed the principal\r\nand the first reward, and after that it bestows abundance of others; so\r\nthat your exercise of virtue towards other men will make your own lives\r\nhappy, and render you more glorious than foreigners can be, and procure\r\nyou an undisputed reputation with posterity. These blessings you will be\r\nable to obtain, in case you hearken to and observe those laws which, by\r\nDivine revelation, I have ordained for you; that is, in case you withal\r\nmeditate upon the wisdom that is in them. I am going from you myself,\r\nrejoicing in the good things you enjoy; and I recommend you to the wise\r\nconduct of your law, to the becoming order of your polity, and to the\r\nvirtues of your commanders, who will take care of what is for your\r\nadvantage. And that God, who has been till now your Leader, and by whose\r\ngoodwill I have myself been useful to you, will not put a period now to\r\nhis providence over you, but as long as you desire to have him your\r\nProtector in your pursuits after virtue, so long will you enjoy his care\r\nover you. Your high priest also Eleazar, as well as Joshua, with the\r\nsenate, and chief of your tribes, will go before you, and suggest the\r\nbest advices to you; by following which advices you will continue to be\r\nhappy: to whom do you give ear without reluctance, as sensible that all\r\nsuch as know well how to be governed, will also know how to govern, if\r\nthey be promoted to that authority themselves. And do not you esteem\r\nliberty to consist in opposing such directions as your governors think\r\nfit to give you for your practice,—as at present indeed you place your\r\nliberty in nothing else but abusing your benefactors; which error if you\r\ncan avoid for the time to come, your affairs will be in a better\r\ncondition than they have hitherto been. Nor do you ever indulge such a\r\ndegree of passion in these matters, as you have oftentimes done when you\r\nhave been very angry at me; for you know that I have been oftener in\r\ndanger of death from you than from our enemies. What I now put you in\r\nmind of, is not done in order to reproach you; for I do not think it\r\nproper, now I am going out of the world, to bring this to your\r\nremembrance, in order to leave you offended at me, since, at the time\r\nwhen I underwent those hardships from you, I was not angry at you; but I\r\ndo it in order to make you wiser hereafter, and to teach you that this\r\nwill be for your security; I mean, that you never be injurious to those\r\nthat preside over you, even when you are become rich, as you will be to\r\na great degree when you have passed over Jordan, and are in possession\r\nof the land of Canaan. Since, when you shall have once proceeded so far\r\nby your wealth, as to a contempt and disregard of virtue, you will also\r\nforfeit the favor of God; and when you have made him your enemy, you\r\nwill be beaten in war, and will have the land which you possess taken\r\naway again from you by your enemies, and this with great reproaches upon\r\nyour conduct. You will be scattered over the whole world, and will, as\r\nslaves, entirely fill both sea and land; and when once you have had the\r\nexperience of what I now say, you will repent, and remember the laws you\r\nhave broken, when it is too late. Whence I would advise you, if you\r\nintend to preserve these laws, to leave none of your enemies alive when\r\nyou have conquered them, but to look upon it as for your advantage to\r\ndestroy them all, lest, if you permit them to live, you taste of their\r\nmanners, and thereby corrupt your own proper institutions. I also do\r\nfurther exhort you, to overthrow their altars, and their groves, and\r\nwhatsoever temples they have among them, and to burn all such, their\r\nnation, and their very memory with fire; for by this means alone the\r\nsafety of your own happy constitution can be firmly secured to you. And\r\nin order to prevent your ignorance of virtue, and the degeneracy of your\r\nnature into vice, I have also ordained you laws, by Divine suggestion,\r\nand a form of government, which are so good, that if you regularly\r\nobserve them, you will be esteemed of all men the most happy.\"\r\n\r\n3. When he had spoken thus, he gave them the laws and the constitution\r\nof government written in a book. Upon which the people fell into tears,\r\nand appeared already touched with the sense that they should have a\r\ngreat want of their conductor, because they remembered what a number of\r\ndangers he had passed through, and what care he had taken of their\r\npreservation: they desponded about what would come upon them after he\r\nwas dead, and thought they should never have another governor like him;\r\nand feared that God would then take less care of them when Moses was\r\ngone, who used to intercede for them. They also repented of what they\r\nhad said to him in the wilderness when they were angry, and were in\r\ngrief on those accounts, insomuch that the whole body of the people fell\r\ninto tears with such bitterness, that it was past the power of words to\r\ncomfort them in their affliction. However, Moses gave them some\r\nconsolation; and by calling them off the thought how worthy he was of\r\ntheir weeping for him, he exhorted them to keep to that form of\r\ngovernment he had given them; and then the congregation was dissolved at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\n4. Accordingly, I shall now first describe this form of government which\r\nwas agreeable to the dignity and virtue of Moses; and shall thereby\r\ninform those that read these Antiquities, what our original settlements\r\nwere, and shall then proceed to the remaining histories. Now those\r\nsettlements are all still in writing, as he left them; and we shall add\r\nnothing by way of ornament, nor any thing besides what Moses left us;\r\nonly we shall so far innovate, as to digest the several kinds of laws\r\ninto a regular system; for they were by him left in writing as they were\r\naccidentally scattered in their delivery, and as he upon inquiry had\r\nlearned them of God. On which account I have thought it necessary to\r\npremise this observation beforehand, lest any of my own countrymen\r\nshould blame me, as having been guilty of an offense herein. Now part of\r\nour constitution will include the laws that belong to our political\r\nstate. As for those laws which Moses left concerning our common\r\nconversation and intercourse one with another, I have reserved that for\r\na discourse concerning our manner of life, and the occasions of those\r\nlaws; which I propose to myself, with God's assistance, to write, after\r\nI have finished the work I am now upon.\r\n\r\n5. When you have possessed yourselves of the land of Canaan, and have\r\nleisure to enjoy the good things of it, and when you have afterward\r\ndetermined to build cities, if you will do what is pleasing to God, you\r\nwill have a secure state of happiness. Let there be then one city of the\r\nland of Canaan, and this situate in the most agreeable place for its\r\ngoodness, and very eminent in itself, and let it be that which God shall\r\nchoose for himself by prophetic revelation. Let there also be one temple\r\ntherein, and one altar, not reared of hewn stones, but of such as you\r\ngather together at random; which stones, when they are whited over with\r\nmortar, will have a handsome appearance, and be beautiful to the sight.\r\nLet the ascent to it be not by steps 16 but by an acclivity of raised\r\nearth. And let there be neither an altar nor a temple in any other city;\r\nfor God is but one, and the nation of the Hebrews is but one.\r\n\r\n6. He that blasphemeth God, let him be stoned; and let him hang upon a\r\ntree all that day, and then let him be buried in an ignominious and\r\nobscure manner.\r\n\r\n7. Let those that live as remote as the bounds of the land which the\r\nHebrews shall possess, come to that city where the temple shall be, and\r\nthis three times in a year, that they may give thanks to God for his\r\nformer benefits, and may entreat him for those they shall want\r\nhereafter; and let them, by this means, maintain a friendly\r\ncorrespondence with one another by such meetings and feastings together,\r\nfor it is a good thing for those that are of the same stock, and under\r\nthe same institution of laws, not to be unacquainted with each other;\r\nwhich acquaintance will be maintained by thus conversing together, and\r\nby seeing and talking with one another, and so renewing the memorials of\r\nthis union; for if they do not thus converse together continually, they\r\nwill appear like mere strangers to one another.\r\n\r\n8. Let there be taken out of your fruits a tenth, besides that which you\r\nhave allotted to give to the priests and Levites. This you may indeed\r\nsell in the country, but it is to be used in those feasts and sacrifices\r\nthat are to be celebrated in the holy city; for it is fit that you\r\nshould enjoy those fruits of the earth which God gives you to possess,\r\nso as may be to the honor of the donor.\r\n\r\n9. You are not to offer sacrifices out of the hire of a woman who is a\r\nharlot 17 for the Deity is not pleased with any thing that arises from\r\nsuch abuses of nature; of which sort none can be worse than this\r\nprostitution of the body. In like manner no one may take the price of\r\nthe covering of a bitch, either of one that is used in hunting, or in\r\nkeeping of sheep, and thence sacrifice to God.\r\n\r\n10. Let no one blaspheme those gods which other cities esteem such; 18\r\nnor may any one steal what belongs to strange temples, nor take away the\r\ngifts that are dedicated to any god.\r\n\r\n11. Let not any one of you wear a garment made of woolen and linen, for\r\nthat is appointed to be for the priests alone.\r\n\r\n12. When the multitude are assembled together unto the holy city for\r\nsacrificing every seventh year, at the feast of tabernacles, let the\r\nhigh priest stand upon a high desk, whence he may be heard, and let him\r\nread the laws to all the people; and let neither the women nor the\r\nchildren be hindered from hearing, no, nor the servants neither; for it\r\nis a good thing that those laws should be engraven in their souls, and\r\npreserved in their memories, that so it may not be possible to blot them\r\nout; for by this means they will not be guilty of sin, when they cannot\r\nplead ignorance of what the laws have enjoined them. The laws also will\r\nhave a greater authority among them, as foretelling what they will\r\nsuffer if they break them; and imprinting in their souls by this hearing\r\nwhat they command them to do, that so there may always be within their\r\nminds that intention of the laws which they have despised and broken,\r\nand have thereby been the causes of their own mischief. Let the children\r\nalso learn the laws, as the first thing they are taught, which will be\r\nthe best thing they can be taught, and will be the cause of their future\r\nfelicity.\r\n\r\n13. Let every one commemorate before God the benefits which he bestowed\r\nupon them at their deliverance out of the land of Egypt, and this twice\r\nevery day, both when the day begins and when the hour of sleep comes on,\r\ngratitude being in its own nature a just thing, and serving not only by\r\nway of return for past, but also by way of invitation of future favors.\r\nThey are also to inscribe the principal blessings they have received\r\nfrom God upon their doors, and show the same remembrance of them upon\r\ntheir arms; as also they are to bear on their forehead and their arm\r\nthose wonders which declare the power of God, and his good-will towards\r\nthem, that God's readiness to bless them may appear every where\r\nconspicuous about them. 19\r\n\r\n14. Let there be seven men to judge in every city, 20 and these such as\r\nhave been before most zealous in the exercise of virtue and\r\nrighteousness. Let every judge have two officers allotted him out of the\r\ntribe of Levi. Let those that are chosen to judge in the several cities\r\nbe had in great honor; and let none be permitted to revile any others\r\nwhen these are present, nor to carry themselves in an insolent manner to\r\nthem; it being natural that reverence towards those in high offices\r\namong men should procure men's fear and reverence towards God. Let those\r\nthat judge be permitted to determine according as they think to be\r\nright, unless any one can show that they have taken bribes, to the\r\nperversion of justice, or can allege any other accusation against them,\r\nwhereby it may appear that they have passed an unjust sentence; for it\r\nis not fit that causes should be openly determined out of regard to\r\ngain, or to the dignity of the suitors, but that the judges should\r\nesteem what is right before all other things, otherwise God will by that\r\nmeans be despised, and esteemed inferior to those, the dread of whose\r\npower has occasioned the unjust sentence; for justice is the power of\r\nGod. He therefore that gratifies those in great dignity, supposes them\r\nmore potent than God himself. But if these judges be unable to give a\r\njust sentence about the causes that come before them, [which case is not\r\nunfrequent in human affairs,] let them send the cause undetermined to\r\nthe holy city, and there let the high priest, the prophet, and the\r\nsanhedrim, determine as it shall seem good to them.\r\n\r\n15. But let not a single witness be credited, but three, or two at the\r\nleast, and those such whose testimony is confirmed by their good lives.\r\nBut let not the testimony of women be admitted, on account of the levity\r\nand boldness of their sex 21 Nor let servants be admitted to give\r\ntestimony, on account of the ignobility of their soul; since it is\r\nprobable that they may not speak truth, either out of hope of gain, or\r\nfear of punishment. But if any one be believed to have borne false\r\nwitness, let him, when he is convicted, suffer all the very same\r\npunishments which he against whom he bore witness was to have suffered.\r\n\r\n16. If a murder be committed in any place, and he that did it be not\r\nfound, nor is there any suspicion upon one as if he had hated the man,\r\nand so had killed him, let there be a very diligent inquiry made after\r\nthe man, and rewards proposed to any one who will discover him; but if\r\nstill no information can be procured, let the magistrates and senate of\r\nthose cities that lie near the place in which the murder was committed,\r\nassemble together, and measure the distance from the place where the\r\ndead body lies; then let the magistrates of the nearest city thereto\r\npurchase a heifer, and bring it to a valley, and to a place therein\r\nwhere there is no land ploughed or trees planted, and let them cut the\r\nsinews of the heifer; then the priests and Levites, and the senate of\r\nthat city, shall take water and wash their hands over the head of the\r\nheifer; and they shall openly declare that their hands are innocent of\r\nthis murder, and that they have neither done it themselves, nor been\r\nassisting to any that did it. They shall also beseech God to be merciful\r\nto them, that no such horrid act may any more be done in that land.\r\n\r\n17. Aristocracy, and the way of living under it, is the best\r\nconstitution: and may you never have any inclination to any other form\r\nof government; and may you always love that form, and have the laws for\r\nyour governors, and govern all your actions according to them; for you\r\nneed no supreme governor but God. But if you shall desire a king, let\r\nhim be one of your own nation; let him be always careful of justice and\r\nother virtues perpetually; let him submit to the laws, and esteem God's\r\ncommands to be his highest wisdom; but let him do nothing without the\r\nhigh priest and the votes of the senators: let him not have a great\r\nnumber of wives, nor pursue after abundance of riches, nor a multitude\r\nof horses, whereby he may grow too proud to submit to the laws. And if\r\nhe affect any such things, let him be restrained, lest he become so\r\npotent that his state be inconsistent with your welfare.\r\n\r\n18. Let it not be esteemed lawful to remove boundaries, neither our own,\r\nnor of those with whom we are at peace. Have a care you do not take\r\nthose landmarks away which are, as it were, a divine and unshaken\r\nlimitation of rights made by God himself, to last for ever; since this\r\ngoing beyond limits, and gaining ground upon others, is the occasion of\r\nwars and seditions; for those that remove boundaries are not far off an\r\nattempt to subvert the laws.\r\n\r\n19. He that plants a piece of land, the trees of which produce fruits\r\nbefore the fourth year, is not to bring thence any first-fruits to God,\r\nnor is he to make use of that fruit himself, for it is not produced in\r\nits proper season; for when nature has a force put upon her at an\r\nunseasonable time, the fruit is not proper for God, nor for the master's\r\nuse; but let the owner gather all that is grown on the fourth year, for\r\nthen it is in its proper season. And let him that has gathered it carry\r\nit to the holy city, and spend that, together with the tithe of his\r\nother fruits, in feasting with his friends, with the orphans, and the\r\nwidows. But on the fifth year the fruit is his own, and he may use it as\r\nhe pleases.\r\n\r\n20. You are not to sow with seed a piece of land which is planted with\r\nvines, for it is enough that it supply nourishment to that plant, and be\r\nnot harassed by ploughing also. You are to plough your land with oxen,\r\nand not to oblige other animals to come under the same yoke with them;\r\nbut to till your land with those beasts that are of the same kind with\r\neach other. The seeds are also to be pure, and without mixture, and not\r\nto be compounded of two or three sorts, since nature does not rejoice in\r\nthe union of things that are not in their own nature alike; nor are you\r\nto permit beasts of different kinds to gender together, for there is\r\nreason to fear that this unnatural abuse may extend from beasts of\r\ndifferent kinds to men, though it takes its first rise from evil\r\npractices about such smaller things. Nor is any thing to be allowed, by\r\nimitation whereof any degree of subversion may creep into the\r\nconstitution. Nor do the laws neglect small matters, but provide that\r\neven those may be managed after an unblamable manner.\r\n\r\n21. Let not those that reap, and gather in the corn that is reaped,\r\ngather in the gleanings also; but let them rather leave some handfuls\r\nfor those that are in want of the necessaries of life, that it may be a\r\nsupport and a supply to them, in order to their subsistence. In like\r\nmanner when they gather their grapes, let them leave some smaller\r\nbunches for the poor, and let them pass over some of the fruits of the\r\nolive-trees, when they gather them, and leave them to be partaken of by\r\nthose that have none of their own; for the advantage arising from the\r\nexact collection of all, will not be so considerable to the owners as\r\nwill arise from the gratitude of the poor. And God will provide that the\r\nland shall more willingly produce what shall be for the nourishment of\r\nits fruits, in case you do not merely take care of your own advantage,\r\nbut have regard to the support of others also. Nor are you to muzzle the\r\nmouths of the oxen when they tread the ears of corn in the thrashing-\r\nfloor; for it is not just to restrain our fellow-laboring animals, and\r\nthose that work in order to its production, of this fruit of their\r\nlabors. Nor are you to prohibit those that pass by at the time when your\r\nfruits are ripe to touch them, but to give them leave to fill themselves\r\nfull of what you have; and this whether they be of your own country or\r\nstrangers,—as being glad of the opportunity of giving them some part of\r\nyour fruits when they are ripe; but let it not be esteemed lawful for\r\nthem to carry any away. Nor let those that gather the grapes, and carry\r\nthem to the wine-presses, restrain those whom they meet from eating of\r\nthem; for it is unjust, out of envy, to hinder those that desire it, to\r\npartake of the good things that come into the world according to God's\r\nwill, and this while the season is at the height, and is hastening away\r\nas it pleases God. Nay, if some, out of bashfulness, are unwilling to\r\ntouch these fruits, let them be encouraged to take of them [I mean,\r\nthose that are Israelites] as if they were themselves the owners and\r\nlords, on account of the kindred there is between them. Nay, let them\r\ndesire men that come from other countries, to partake of these tokens of\r\nfriendship which God has given in their proper season; for that is not\r\nto be deemed as idly spent, which any one out of kindness communicates\r\nto another, since God bestows plenty of good things on men, not only for\r\nthemselves to reap the advantage, but also to give to others in a way of\r\ngenerosity; and he is desirous, by this means, to make known to others\r\nhis peculiar kindness to the people of Israel, and how freely he\r\ncommunicates happiness to them, while they abundantly communicate out of\r\ntheir great superfluities to even these foreigners also. But for him\r\nthat acts contrary to this law, let him be beaten with forty stripes\r\nsave one 22 by the public executioner; let him undergo this punishment,\r\nwhich is a most ignominious one for a free-man, and this because he was\r\nsuch a slave to gain as to lay a blot upon his dignity; for it is proper\r\nfor you who have had the experience of the afflictions in Egypt, and of\r\nthose in the wilderness, to make provision for those that are in the\r\nlike circumstances; and while you have now obtained plenty yourselves,\r\nthrough the mercy and providence of God, to distribute of the same\r\nplenty, by the like sympathy, to such as stand in need of it.\r\n\r\n22. Besides those two tithes, which I have already said you are to pay\r\nevery year, the one for the Levites, the other for the festivals, you\r\nare to bring every third year a third tithe to be distributed to those\r\nthat want; 23 to women also that are widows, and to children that are\r\norphans. But as to the ripe fruits, let them carry that which is ripe\r\nfirst of all into the temple; and when they have blessed God for that\r\nland which bare them, and which he had given them for a possession, when\r\nthey have also offered those sacrifices which the law has commanded them\r\nto bring, let them give the first-fruits to the priests. But when any\r\none hath done this, and hath brought the tithe of all that he hath,\r\ntogether with those first-fruits that are for the Levites, and for the\r\nfestivals, and when he is about to go home, let him stand before the\r\nholy house, and return thanks to God, that he hath delivered them from\r\nthe injurious treatment they had in Egypt, and hath given them a good\r\nland, and a large, and lets them enjoy the fruits thereof; and when he\r\nhath openly testified that he hath fully paid the tithes [and other\r\ndues] according to the laws of Moses, let him entreat God that he will\r\nbe ever merciful and gracious to him, and continue so to be to all the\r\nHebrews, both by preserving the good things which he hath already given\r\nthem, and by adding what it is still in his power to bestow upon them.\r\n\r\n23. Let the Hebrews marry, at the age fit for it, virgins that are free,\r\nand born of good parents. And he that does not marry a virgin, let him\r\nnot corrupt another man's wife, and marry her, nor grieve her former\r\nhusband. Nor let free men marry slaves, although their affections should\r\nstrongly bias any of them so to do; for it is decent, and for the\r\ndignity of the persons themselves, to govern those their affections. And\r\nfurther, no one ought to marry a harlot, whose matrimonial oblations,\r\narising from the prostitution of her body, God will not receive; for by\r\nthese means the dispositions of the children will be liberal and\r\nvirtuous; I mean, when they are not born of base parents, and of the\r\nlustful conjunction of such as marry women that are not free. If any one\r\nhas been espoused to a woman as to a virgin, and does not afterward find\r\nher so to be, let him bring his action, and accuse her, and let him make\r\nuse of such indications 24 to prove his accusation as he is furnished\r\nwithal; and let the father or the brother of the damsel, or some one\r\nthat is after them nearest of kin to her, defend her If the damsel\r\nobtain a sentence in her favor, that she had not been guilty, let her\r\nlive with her husband that accused her; and let him not have any further\r\npower at all to put her away, unless she give him very great occasions\r\nof suspicion, and such as can be no way contradicted. But for him that\r\nbrings an accusation and calumny against his wife in an impudent and\r\nrash manner, let him be punished by receiving forty stripes save one,\r\nand let him pay fifty shekels to her father: but if the damsel be\r\nconvicted, as having been corrupted, and is one of the common people,\r\nlet her be stoned, because she did not preserve her virginity till she\r\nwere lawfully married; but if she were the daughter of a priest, let her\r\nbe burnt alive. If any one has two wives, and if he greatly respect and\r\nbe kind to one of them, either out of his affection to her, or for her\r\nbeauty, or for some other reason, while the other is of less esteem with\r\nhim; and if the son of her that is beloved be the younger by birth than\r\nanother born of the other wife, but endeavors to obtain the right of\r\nprimogeniture from his father's kindness to his mother, and would\r\nthereby obtain a double portion of his father's substance, for that\r\ndouble portion is what I have allotted him in the laws,—let not this be\r\npermitted; for it is unjust that he who is the elder by birth should be\r\ndeprived of what is due to him, on the father's disposition of his\r\nestate, because his mother was not equally regarded by him. He that hath\r\ncorrupted a damsel espoused to another man, in case he had her consent,\r\nlet both him and her be put to death, for they are both equally guilty;\r\nthe man, because he persuaded the woman willingly to submit to a most\r\nimpure action, and to prefer it to lawful wedlock; the woman, because\r\nshe was persuaded to yield herself to be corrupted, either for pleasure\r\nor for gain. However, if a man light on a woman when she is alone, and\r\nforces her, where nobody was present to come to her assistance, let him\r\nonly be put to death. Let him that hath corrupted a virgin not yet\r\nespoused marry her; but if the father of the damsel be not willing that\r\nshe should be his wife, let him pay fifty shekels as the price of her\r\nprostitution. He that desires to be divorced from his wife for any cause\r\n25 whatsoever, [and many such causes happen among men,] let him in\r\nwriting give assurance that he will never use her as his wife any more;\r\nfor by this means she may be at liberty to marry another husband,\r\nalthough before this bill of divorce be given, she is not to be\r\npermitted so to do: but if she be misused by him also, or if, when he is\r\ndead, her first husband would marry her again, it shall not be lawful\r\nfor her to return to him. If a woman's husband die, and leave her\r\nwithout children, let his brother marry her, and let him call the son\r\nthat is born to him by his brother's name, and educate him as the heir\r\nof his inheritance, for this procedure will be for the benefit of the\r\npublic, because thereby families will not fail, and the estate will\r\ncontinue among the kindred; and this will be for the solace of wives\r\nunder their affliction, that they are to be married to the next relation\r\nof their former husbands. But if the brother will not marry her, let the\r\nwoman come before the senate, and protest openly that this brother will\r\nnot admit her for his wife, but will injure the memory of his deceased\r\nbrother, while she is willing to continue in the family, and to bear him\r\nchildren. And when the senate have inquired of him for what reason it is\r\nthat he is averse to this marriage, whether he gives a bad or a good\r\nreason, the matter must come to this issue, That the woman shall loose\r\nthe sandals of the brother, and shall spit in his face, and say, He\r\ndeserves this reproachful treatment from her, as having injured the\r\nmemory of the deceased. And then let him go away out of the senate, and\r\nbear this reproach upon him all his life long; and let her marry to whom\r\nshe pleases, of such as seek her in marriage. But now, if any man take\r\ncaptive, either a virgin, or one that hath been married, 26 and has a\r\nmind to marry her, let him not be allowed to bring her to bed to him, or\r\nto live with her as his wife, before she hath her head shaven, and hath\r\nput on her mourning habit, and lamented her relations and friends that\r\nwere slain in the battle, that by this means she may give vent to her\r\nsorrow for them, and after that may betake herself to feasting and\r\nmatrimony; for it is good for him that takes a woman, in order to have\r\nchildren by her, to be complaisant to her inclinations, and not merely\r\nto pursue his own pleasure, while he hath no regard to what is agreeable\r\nto her. But when thirty days are past, as the time of mourning, for so\r\nmany are sufficient to prudent persons for lamenting the dearest\r\nfriends, then let them proceed to the marriage; but in case when he hath\r\nsatisfied his lust, he be too proud to retain her for his wife, let him\r\nnot have it in his power to make her a slave, but let her go away\r\nwhither she pleases, and have that privilege of a free woman.\r\n\r\n24. As to those young men that despise their parents, and do not pay\r\nthem honor, but offer them affronts, either because they are ashamed of\r\nthem or think themselves wiser than they,—in the first place, let their\r\nparents admonish them in words, [for they are by nature of authority\r\nsufficient for becoming their judges,] and let them say thus to\r\nthem:—That they cohabited together, not for the sake of pleasure, nor\r\nfor the augmentation of their riches, by joining both their stocks\r\ntogether, but that they might have children to take care of them in\r\ntheir old age, and might by them have what they then should want. And\r\nsay further to him, \"That when thou wast born, we took thee up with\r\ngladness, and gave God the greatest thanks for thee, and brought time up\r\nwith great care, and spared for nothing that appeared useful for thy\r\npreservation, and for thy instruction in what was most excellent. And\r\nnow, since it is reasonable to forgive the sins of those that are young,\r\nlet it suffice thee to have given so many indications Of thy contempt of\r\nus; reform thyself, and act more wisely for the time to come;\r\nconsidering that God is displeased with those that are insolent towards\r\ntheir parents, because he is himself the Father of the whole race of\r\nmankind, and seems to bear part of that dishonor which falls upon those\r\nthat have the same name, when they do not meet with dire returns from\r\ntheir children. And on such the law inflicts inexorable punishment; of\r\nwhich punishment mayst thou never have the experience.\" Now if the\r\ninsolence of young men be thus cured, let them escape the reproach which\r\ntheir former errors deserved; for by this means the lawgiver will appear\r\nto be good, and parents happy, while they never behold either a son or a\r\ndaughter brought to punishment. But if it happen that these words and\r\ninstructions, conveyed by them in order to reclaim the man, appear to be\r\nuseless, then the offender renders the laws implacable enemies to the\r\ninsolence he has offered his parents; let him therefore be brought forth\r\n27 by these very parents out of the city, with a multitude following\r\nhim, and there let him be stoned; and when he has continued there for\r\none whole day, that all the people may see him, let him be buried in the\r\nnight. And thus it is that we bury all whom the laws condemn to die,\r\nupon any account whatsoever. Let our enemies that fall in battle be also\r\nburied; nor let any one dead body lie above the ground, or suffer a\r\npunishment beyond what justice requires.\r\n\r\n25. Let no one lend to any one of the Hebrews upon usury, neither usury\r\nof what is eaten or what is drunken, for it is not just to make\r\nadvantage of the misfortunes of one of thy own countrymen; but when thou\r\nhast been assistant to his necessities, think it thy gain if thou\r\nobtainest their gratitude to thee; and withal that reward which will\r\ncome to thee from God, for thy humanity towards him.\r\n\r\n26. Those who have borrowed either silver or any sort of fruits, whether\r\ndry or wet, [I mean this, when the Jewish affairs shall, by the blessing\r\nof God, be to their own mind,] let the borrowers bring them again, and\r\nrestore them with pleasure to those who lent them, laying them up, as it\r\nwere, in their own treasuries, and justly expecting to receive them\r\nthence, if they shall want them again. But if they be without shame, and\r\ndo not restore it, let not the lender go to the borrower's house, and\r\ntake a pledge himself, before judgment be given concerning it; but let\r\nhim require the pledge, and let the debtor bring it of himself, without\r\nthe least opposition to him that comes upon him under the protection of\r\nthe law. And if he that gave the pledge be rich, let the creditor retain\r\nit till what he lent be paid him again; but if he be poor, let him that\r\ntakes it return it before the going down of the sun, especially if the\r\npledge be a garment, that the debtor may have it for a covering in his\r\nsleep, God himself naturally showing mercy to the poor. It is also not\r\nlawful to take a millstone, nor any utensil thereto belonging, for a\r\npledge, that the debtor, may not be deprived of instruments to get their\r\nfood withal, and lest they be undone by their necessity.\r\n\r\n27. Let death be the punishment for stealing a man; but he that hath\r\npurloined gold or silver, let him pay double. If any one kill a man that\r\nis stealing something out of his house, let him be esteemed guiltless,\r\nalthough the man were only breaking in at the wall. Let him that hath\r\nstolen cattle pay fourfold what is lost, excepting the case of an ox,\r\nfor which let the thief pay fivefold. Let him that is so poor that he\r\ncannot pay what mulet is laid upon him, be his servant to whom he was\r\nadjudged to pay it.\r\n\r\n28. If any one be sold to one of his own nation, let him serve him six\r\nyears, and on the seventh let him go free. But if he have a son by a\r\nwoman servant in his purchaser's house, and if, on account of his good-\r\nwill to his master, and his natural affection to his wife and children,\r\nhe will be his servant still, let him be set free only at the coming of\r\nthe year of jubilee, which is the fiftieth year, and let him then take\r\naway with him his children and wife, and let them be free also.\r\n\r\n29. If any one find gold or silver on the road, let him inquire after\r\nhim that lost it, and make proclamation of the place where he found it,\r\nand then restore it to him again, as not thinking it right to make his\r\nown profit by the loss of another. And the same rule is to be observed\r\nin cattle found to have wandered away into a lonely place. If the owner\r\nbe not presently discovered, let him that is the finder keep it with\r\nhimself, and appeal to God that he has not purloined what belongs to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n30. It is not lawful to pass by any beast that is in distress, when in a\r\nstorm it is fallen down in the mire, but to endeavor to preserve it, as\r\nhaving a sympathy with it in its pain.\r\n\r\n31. It is also a duty to show the roads to those who do not know them,\r\nand not to esteem it a matter for sport, when we hinder others'\r\nadvantages, by setting them in a wrong way.\r\n\r\n32. In like manner, let no one revile a person blind or dumb.\r\n\r\n33. If men strive together, and there be no instrument of iron, let him\r\nthat is smitten be avenged immediately, by inflicting the same\r\npunishment on him that smote him: but if when he is carried home he lie\r\nsick many days, and then die, let him that smote him not escape\r\npunishment; but if he that is smitten escape death, and yet be at great\r\nexpense for his cure, the smiter shall pay for all that has been\r\nexpended during the time of his sickness, and for all that he has paid\r\nthe physician. He that kicks a woman with child, so that the woman\r\nmiscarry, 28 let him pay a fine in money, as the judges shall determine,\r\nas having diminished the multitude by the destruction of what was in her\r\nwomb; and let money also be given the woman's husband by him that kicked\r\nher; but if she die of the stroke, let him also be put to death, the law\r\njudging it equitable that life should go for life.\r\n\r\n34. Let no one of the Israelites keep any poison 29 that may cause\r\ndeath, or any other harm; but if he be caught with it, let him be put to\r\ndeath, and suffer the very same mischief that he would have brought upon\r\nthem for whom the poison was prepared.\r\n\r\n35. He that maimeth any one, let him undergo the like himself, and be\r\ndeprived of the same member of which he hath deprived the other, unless\r\nhe that is maimed will accept of money instead of it 30 for the law\r\nmakes the sufferer the judge of the value of what he hath suffered, and\r\npermits him to estimate it, unless he will be more severe.\r\n\r\n36. Let him that is the owner of an ox which pusheth with his horn, kill\r\nhim: but if he pushes and gores any one in the thrashing-floor, let him\r\nbe put to death by stoning, and let him not be thought fit for food: but\r\nif his owner be convicted as having known what his nature was, and hath\r\nnot kept him up, let him also be put to death, as being the occasion of\r\nthe ox's having killed a man. But if the ox have killed a man-servant,\r\nor a maid-servant, let him be stoned; and let the owner of the ox pay\r\nthirty shekels 31 to the master of him that was slain; but if it be an\r\nox that is thus smitten and killed, let both the oxen, that which smote\r\nthe other and that which was killed, be sold, and let the owners of them\r\ndivide their price between them.\r\n\r\n37. Let those that dig a well or a pit be careful to lay planks over\r\nthem, and so keep them shut up, not in order to hinder any persons from\r\ndrawing water, but that there may be no danger of falling into them. But\r\nif any one's beast fall into such a well or pit thus digged, and not\r\nshut up, and perish, let the owner pay its price to the owner of the\r\nbeast. Let there be a battlement round the tops of your houses instead\r\nof a wall, that may prevent any persons from rolling down and perishing.\r\n\r\n38. Let him that has received any thing in trust for another, take care\r\nto keep it as a sacred and divine thing; and let no one invent any\r\ncontrivance whereby to deprive him that hath intrusted it with him of\r\nthe same, and this whether he be a man or a woman; no, not although he\r\nor she were to gain an immense sum of gold, and this where he cannot be\r\nconvicted of it by any body; for it is fit that a man's own conscience,\r\nwhich knows what he hath, should in all cases oblige him to do well. Let\r\nthis conscience be his witness, and make him always act so as may\r\nprocure him commendation from others; but let him chiefly have regard to\r\nGod, from whom no wicked man can lie concealed: but if he in whom the\r\ntrust was reposed, without any deceit of his own, lose what he was\r\nintrusted withal, let him come before the seven judges, and swear by God\r\nthat nothing hath been lost willingly, or with a wicked intention, and\r\nthat he hath not made use of any part thereof, and so let him depart\r\nwithout blame; but if he hath made use of the least part of what was\r\ncommitted to him, and it be lost, let him be condemned to repay all that\r\nhe had received. After the same manner as in these trusts it is to be,\r\nif any one defraud those that undergo bodily labor for him. And let it\r\nbe always remembered, that we are not to defraud a poor man of his\r\nwages, as being sensible that God has allotted these wages to him\r\ninstead of land and other possessions; nay, this payment is not at all\r\nto be delayed, but to be made that very day, since God is not willing to\r\ndeprive the laborer of the immediate use of what he hath labored for.\r\n\r\n39. You are not to punish children for the faults of their parents, but\r\non account of their own virtue rather to vouchsafe them commiseration,\r\nbecause they were born of wicked parents, than hatred, because they were\r\nborn of bad ones. Nor indeed ought we to impute the sin of children to\r\ntheir fathers, while young persons indulge themselves in many practices\r\ndifferent from what they have been instructed in, and this by their\r\nproud refusal of such instruction.\r\n\r\n40. Let those that have made themselves eunuchs be had in detestation;\r\nand do you avoid any conversation with them who have deprived themselves\r\nof their manhood, and of that fruit of generation which God has given to\r\nmen for the increase of their kind: let such be driven away, as if they\r\nhad killed their children, since they beforehand have lost what should\r\nprocure them; for evident it is, that while their soul is become\r\neffeminate, they have withal transfused that effeminacy to their body\r\nalso. In like manner do you treat all that is of a monstrous nature when\r\nit is looked on; nor is it lawful to geld men or any other animals. 32\r\n\r\n41. Let this be the constitution of your political laws in time of\r\npeace, and God will be so merciful as to preserve this excellent\r\nsettlement free from disturbance: and may that time never come which may\r\ninnovate any thing, and change it for the contrary. But since it must\r\nneeds happen that mankind fall into troubles and dangers, either\r\nundesignedly or intentionally, come let us make a few constitutions\r\nconcerning them, that so being apprised beforehand what ought to be\r\ndone, you may have salutary counsels ready when you want them, and may\r\nnot then be obliged to go to seek what is to be done, and so be\r\nunprovided, and fall into dangerous circumstances. May you be a\r\nlaborious people, and exercise your souls in virtuous actions, and\r\nthereby possess and inherit the land without wars; while neither any\r\nforeigners make war upon it, and so afflict you, nor any internal\r\nsedition seize upon it, whereby you may do things that are contrary to\r\nyour fathers, and so lose the laws which they have established. And may\r\nyou continue in the observation of those laws which God hath approved\r\nof, and hath delivered to you. Let all sort of warlike operations,\r\nwhether they befall you now in your own time, or hereafter in the times\r\nof your posterity, be done out of your own borders: but when you are\r\nabout to go to war, send embassages and heralds to those who are your\r\nvoluntary enemies, for it is a right thing to make use of words to them\r\nbefore you come to your weapons of war; and assure them thereby, that\r\nalthough you have a numerous army, with horses and weapons, and, above\r\nthese, a God merciful to you, and ready to assist you, you do however\r\ndesire them not to compel you to fight against them, nor to take from\r\nthem what they have, which will indeed be our gain, but what they will\r\nhave no reason to wish we should take to ourselves. And if they hearken\r\nto you, it will be proper for you to keep peace with them; but if they\r\ntrust in their own strength, as superior to yours, and will not do you\r\njustice, lead your army against them, making use of God as your supreme\r\nCommander, but ordaining for a lieutenant under him one that is of the\r\ngreatest courage among you; for these different commanders, besides\r\ntheir being an obstacle to actions that are to be done on the sudden,\r\nare a disadvantage to those that make use of them. Lead an army pure,\r\nand of chosen men, composed of all such as have extraordinary strength\r\nof body and hardiness of soul; but do you send away the timorous part,\r\nlest they run away in the time of action, and so afford an advantage to\r\nyour enemies. Do you also give leave to those that have lately built\r\nthem houses, and have not yet lived in them a year's time; and to those\r\nthat have planted them vineyards, and have not yet been partakers of\r\ntheir fruits,—to continue in their own country; as well as those also\r\nwho have betrothed, or lately married them wives, lest they have such an\r\naffection for these things that they be too sparing of their lives, and,\r\nby reserving themselves for these enjoyments, they become voluntary\r\ncowards, on account of their wives.\r\n\r\n42. When you have pitched your camp, take care that you do nothing that\r\nis cruel. And when you are engaged in a siege; and want timber for the\r\nmaking of warlike engines, do not you render the land naked by cutting\r\ndown trees that bear fruit, but spare them, as considering that they\r\nwere made for the benefit of men; and that if they could speak, they\r\nwould have a just plea against you, because, though they are not\r\noccasions of the war, they are unjustly treated, and suffer in it, and\r\nwould, if they were able, remove themselves into another land. When you\r\nhave beaten your enemies in battle, slay those that have fought against\r\nyou; but preserve the others alive, that they may pay you tribute,\r\nexcepting the nation of the Canaanites; for as to that people, you must\r\nentirely destroy them.\r\n\r\n43, Take care, especially in your battles, that no woman use the habit\r\nof a man, nor man the garment of a woman.\r\n\r\n44. This was the form of political government which was left us by\r\nMoses. Moreover, he had already delivered laws in writing 33 in the\r\nfortieth year [after they came out of Egypt], concerning which we will\r\ndiscourse in another book. But now on the following days [for he called\r\nthem to assemble continually] he delivered blessings to them, and curses\r\nupon those that should not live according to the laws, but should\r\ntransgress the duties that were determined for them to observe. After\r\nthis, he read to them a poetic song, which was composed in hexameter\r\nverse, and left it to them in the holy book: it contained a prediction\r\nof what was to come to pass afterward; agreeably whereto all things have\r\nhappened all along, and do still happen to us; and wherein he has not at\r\nall deviated from the truth. Accordingly, he delivered these books to\r\nthe priest, 34 with the ark; into which he also put the ten\r\ncommandments, written on two tables. He delivered to them the tabernacle\r\nalso, and exhorted the people, that when they had conquered the land,\r\nand were settled in it, they should not forget the injuries of the\r\nAmalekites, but make war against them, and inflict punishment upon them\r\nfor what mischief they did them when they were in the wilderness; and\r\nthat when they had got possession of the land of the Canaanites, and\r\nwhen they had destroyed the whole multitude of its inhabitants, as they\r\nought to do, they should erect an altar that should face the rising sun,\r\nnot far from the city of Shechem, between the two mountains, that of\r\nGerizzim, situate on the right hand, and that called Ebal, on the left;\r\nand that the army should be so divided, that six tribes should stand\r\nupon each of the two mountains, and with them the Levites and the\r\npriests. And that first, those that were upon Mount Gerizzim should pray\r\nfor the best blessings upon those who were diligent about the worship of\r\nGod, and the observation of his laws, and who did not reject what Moses\r\nhad said to them; while the other wished them all manner of happiness\r\nalso; and when these last put up the like prayers, the former praised\r\nthem. After this, curses were denounced upon those that should\r\ntransgress those laws, they, answering one another alternately, by way\r\nof confirmation of what had been said. Moses also wrote their blessings\r\nand their curses, that they might learn them so thoroughly, that they\r\nmight never be forgotten by length of time. And when he was ready to\r\ndie, he wrote these blessings and curses upon the altar, on each side of\r\nit; where he says also the people stood, and then sacrificed and offered\r\nburnt-offerings, though after that day they never offered upon it any\r\nother sacrifice, for it was not lawful so to do. These are the\r\nconstitutions of Moses; and the Hebrew nation still live according to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n45. On the next day, Moses called the people together, with the women\r\nand children, to a congregation, so as the very slaves were present\r\nalso, that they might engage themselves to the observation of these laws\r\nby oath; and that, duly considering the meaning of God in them, they\r\nmight not, either for favor of their kindred, or out of fear of any one,\r\nor indeed for any motive whatsoever, think any thing ought to be\r\npreferred to these laws, and so might transgress them. That in case any\r\none of their own blood, or any city, should attempt to confound or\r\ndissolve their constitution of government, they should take vengeance\r\nupon them, both all in general, and each person in particular; and when\r\nthey had conquered them, should overturn their city to the very\r\nfoundations, and, if possible, should not leave the least footsteps of\r\nsuch madness: but that if they were not able to take such vengeance,\r\nthey should still demonstrate that what was done was contrary to their\r\nwills. So the multitude bound themselves by oath so to do.\r\n\r\n46. Moses taught them also by what means their sacrifices might be the\r\nmost acceptable to God; and how they should go forth to war, making use\r\nof the stones [in the high priest's breastplate] for their direction, 35\r\nas I have before signified. Joshua also prophesied while Moses was\r\npresent. And when Moses had recapitulated whatsoever he had done for the\r\npreservation of the people, both in their wars and in peace, and had\r\ncomposed them a body of laws, and procured them an excellent form of\r\ngovernment, he foretold, as God had declared to him that if they\r\ntransgressed that institution for the worship of God, they should\r\nexperience the following miseries:—Their land should be full of weapons\r\nof war from their enemies, and their cities should be overthrown, and\r\ntheir temple should be burnt that they should be sold for slaves, to\r\nsuch men as would have no pity on them in their afflictions; that they\r\nwould then repent, when that repentance would no way profit them under\r\ntheir sufferings. \"Yet,\" said he, \"will that God who founded your\r\nnation, restore your cities to your citizens, with their temple also;\r\nand you shall lose these advantages not once only, but often.\"\r\n\r\n47. Now when Moses had encouraged Joshua to lead out the army against\r\nthe Canaanites, by telling him that God would assist him in all his\r\nundertakings, and had blessed the whole multitude, he said, \"Since I am\r\ngoing to my forefathers, and God has determined that this should be the\r\nday of my departure to them, I return him thanks while I am still alive\r\nand present with you, for that providence he hath exercised over you,\r\nwhich hath not only delivered us from the miseries we lay under, but\r\nhath bestowed a state of prosperity upon us; as also, that he hath\r\nassisted me in the pains I took, and in all the contrivances I had in my\r\ncare about you, in order to better your condition, and hath on all\r\noccasions showed himself favorable to us; or rather he it was who first\r\nconducted our affairs, and brought them to a happy conclusion, by making\r\nuse of me as a vicarious general under him, and as a minister in those\r\nmatters wherein he was willing to do you good: on which account I think\r\nit proper to bless that Divine Power which will take care of you for the\r\ntime to come, and this in order to repay that debt which I owe him, and\r\nto leave behind me a memorial that we are obliged to worship and honor\r\nhim, and to keep those laws which are the most excellent gift of all\r\nthose he hath already bestowed upon us, or which, if he continue\r\nfavorable to us, he will bestow upon us hereafter. Certainly a human\r\nlegislator is a terrible enemy when his laws are affronted, and are made\r\nto no purpose. And may you never experience that displeasure of God\r\nwhich will be the consequence of the neglect of these his laws, which\r\nhe, who is your Creator, hath given you.\"\r\n\r\n48. When Moses had spoken thus at the end of his life, and had foretold\r\nwhat would befall to every one of their tribes 36 afterward, with the\r\naddition of a blessing to them, the multitude fell into tears, insomuch\r\nthat even the women, by beating their breasts, made manifest the deep\r\nconcern they had when he was about to die. The children also lamented\r\nstill more, as not able to contain their grief; and thereby declared,\r\nthat even at their age they were sensible of his virtue and mighty\r\ndeeds; and truly there seemed to be a strife betwixt the young and the\r\nold who should most grieve for him. The old grieved because they knew\r\nwhat a careful protector they were to be deprived of, and so lamented\r\ntheir future state; but the young grieved, not only for that, but also\r\nbecause it so happened that they were to be left by him before they had\r\nwell tasted of his virtue. Now one may make a guess at the excess of\r\nthis sorrow and lamentation of the multitude, from what happened to the\r\nlegislator himself; for although he was always persuaded that he ought\r\nnot to be cast down at the approach of death, since the undergoing it\r\nwas agreeable to the will of God and the law of nature, yet what the\r\npeople did so overbore him, that he wept himself. Now as he went thence\r\nto the place where he was to vanish out of their sight, they all\r\nfollowed after him weeping; but Moses beckoned with his hand to those\r\nthat were remote from him, and bade them stay behind in quiet, while he\r\nexhorted those that were near to him that they would not render his\r\ndeparture so lamentable. Whereupon they thought they ought to grant him\r\nthat favor, to let him depart according as he himself desired; so they\r\nrestrained themselves, though weeping still towards one another. All\r\nthose who accompanied him were the senate, and Eleazar the high priest,\r\nand Joshua their commander. Now as soon as they were come to the\r\nmountain called Abarim, [which is a very high mountain, situate over\r\nagainst Jericho, and one that affords, to such as are upon it, a\r\nprospect of the greatest part of the excellent land of Canaan,] he\r\ndismissed the senate; and as he was going to embrace Eleazar and Joshua,\r\nand was still discoursing with them, a cloud stood over him on the\r\nsudden, and he disappeared in a certain valley, although he wrote in the\r\nholy books that he died, which was done out of fear, lest they should\r\nventure to say that, because of his extraordinary virtue, he went to\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n49. Now Moses lived in all one hundred and twenty years; a third part of\r\nwhich time, abating one month, he was the people's ruler; and he died on\r\nthe last month of the year, which is called by the Macedonians Dystrus,\r\nbut by us Adar, on the first day of the month. He was one that exceeded\r\nall men that ever were in understanding, and made the best use of what\r\nthat understanding suggested to him. He had a very graceful way of\r\nspeaking and addressing himself to the multitude; and as to his other\r\nqualifications, he had such a full command of his passions, as if he\r\nhardly had any such in his soul, and only knew them by their names, as\r\nrather perceiving them in other men than in himself. He was also such a\r\ngeneral of an army as is seldom seen, as well as such a prophet as was\r\nnever known, and this to such a degree, that whatsoever he pronounced,\r\nyou would think you heard the voice of God himself. So the people\r\nmourned for him thirty days: nor did ever any grief so deeply affect the\r\nHebrews as did this upon the death of Moses: nor were those that had\r\nexperienced his conduct the only persons that desired him, but those\r\nalso that perused the laws he left behind him had a strong desire after\r\nhim, and by them gathered the extraordinary virtue he was master of.

But\r\nperhaps we had better keep here close to the text which says Numbers\r\n23:20, 21, that God only permitted Balaam to go along with the\r\nambassadors, in case they came and called him, or positively insisted on\r\nhis going along with them, on any terms; whereas Balaam seems out of\r\nimpatience to have risen up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and\r\nrather to have called them, than staid for their calling him, so zealous\r\ndoes he seem to have been for his reward of divination, his wages of\r\nunrighteousness, Numbers 23:7, 17, 18, 37; 2 Peter 2:15; Jude 5, 11;\r\nwhich reward or wages the truly religious prophets of God never required\r\nnor accepted, as our Josephus justly takes notice in the cases of\r\nSamuel, Antiq. B. V. ch. 4. sect. 1, and Daniel, Antiq. B. X. ch. 11.\r\nsect. 3.

In the third, the reason\r\nis given why king Agag was not to be spared, viz. because of his former\r\ncruelty: \"As thy sword hath made the [Hebrew] women childless, so shall\r\nthy mother be made childless among women by the Hebrews.\" In the last\r\nplace, the apostles, or their amanuensis Clement, gave this reason for\r\nthe necessity of the coming of Christ, that \"men had formerly perverted\r\nboth the positive law, and that of nature; and had cast out of their\r\nmind the memory of the Flood, the burning of Sodom, the plagues of the\r\nEgyptians, and the slaughter of the inhabitants of Palestine,\" as signs\r\nof the most amazing impenitence and insensibility, under the punishments\r\nof horrid wickedness.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15 (return) [ Josephus here, in this one sentence, sums up his notion of\r\nMoses's very long and very serious exhortations in the book of\r\nDeuteronomy; and his words are so true, and of such importance, that\r\nthey deserve to be had in constant remembrance.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 (return) [ This law, both here and Exodus 20:25, 26, of not going up\r\nto God's altar by ladder-steps, but on an acclivity, seems not to have\r\nbelonged to the altar of the tabernacle, which was in all but three\r\ncubits high, Exodus 27:4; nor to that of Ezekiel, which was expressly to\r\nbe gone up to by steps, ch. 43:17; but rather to occasional altars of\r\nany considerable altitude and largeness; as also probably to Solomon's\r\naltar, to which it is here applied by Josephus, as well as to that in\r\nZorobabel's and Herod's temple, which were, I think, all ten cubits\r\nhigh. See 2 Chronicles 4:1, and Antiq. B. VIII. ch. 3. sect. 7. The\r\nreason why these temples, and these only, were to have this ascent on an\r\nacclivity, and not by steps, is obvious, that before the invention of\r\nstairs, such as we now use, decency could not be otherwise provided for\r\nin the loose garments which the priests wore, as the law required.

Containing The Interval Of Four Hundred And Seventy-Six\r\nYears.—From The Death Of Moses To The Death Of Eli.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. How Joshua, The Commander Of The Hebrews, Made War With The\r\nCanaanites, And Overcame Them, And Destroyed Them, And Divided Their\r\nLand By Lot To The Tribes Of Israel.\r\n\r\n1. When Moses was taken away from among men, in the manner already\r\ndescribed, and when all the solemnities belonging to the mourning for\r\nhim were finished, and the sorrow for him was over, Joshua commanded the\r\nmultitude to get themselves ready for an expedition. He also sent spies\r\nto Jericho to discover what forces they had, and what were their\r\nintentions; but he put his camp in order, as intending soon to pass over\r\nJordan at a proper season. And calling to him the rulers of the tribe of\r\nReuben, and the governors of the tribe of Gad, and [the half tribe of]\r\nManasseh, for half of this tribe had been permitted to have their\r\nhabitation in the country of the Amorites, which was the seventh part of\r\nthe land of Canaan, 1 he put them in mind what they had promised Moses;\r\nand he exhorted them that, for the sake of the care that Moses had taken\r\nof them who had never been weary of taking pains for them no, not when\r\nhe was dying, and for the sake of the public welfare, they would prepare\r\nthemselves, and readily perform what they had promised; so he took fifty\r\nthousand of them who followed him, and he marched from Abila to Jordan,\r\nsixty furlongs.\r\n\r\n2. Now when he had pitched his camp, the spies came to him immediately,\r\nwell acquainted with the whole state of the Canaanites; for at first,\r\nbefore they were at all discovered, they took a full view of the city of\r\nJericho without disturbance, and saw which parts of the walls were\r\nstrong, and which parts were otherwise, and indeed insecure, and which\r\nof the gates were so weak as might afford an entrance to their army. Now\r\nthose that met them took no notice of them when they saw them, and\r\nsupposed they were only strangers, who used to be very curious in\r\nobserving everything in the city, and did not take them for enemies; but\r\nat even they retired to a certain inn that was near to the wall, whither\r\nthey went to eat their supper; which supper when they had done, and were\r\nconsidering how to get away, information was given to the king as he was\r\nat supper, that there were some persons come from the Hebrews' camp to\r\nview the city as spies, and that they were in the inn kept by Rahab, and\r\nwere very solicitous that they might not be discovered. So he sent\r\nimmediately some to them, and commanded to catch them, and bring them to\r\nhim, that he might examine them by torture, and learn what their\r\nbusiness was there. As soon as Rahab understood that these messengers\r\nwere coming, she hid the spies under stalks of flax, which were laid to\r\ndry on the top of her house; and said to the messengers that were sent\r\nby the king, that certain unknown strangers had supped with her a little\r\nbefore sun-setting, and were gone away, who might easily be taken, if\r\nthey were any terror to the city, or likely to bring any danger to the\r\nking. So these messengers being thus deluded by the woman, 2 and\r\nsuspecting no imposition, went their ways, without so much as searching\r\nthe inn; but they immediately pursued them along those roads which they\r\nmost probably supposed them to have gone, and those particularly which\r\nled to the river, but could hear no tidings of them; so they left off\r\nthe pains of any further pursuit. But when the tumult was over, Rahab\r\nbrought the men down, and desired them as soon as they should have\r\nobtained possession of the land of Canaan, when it would be in their\r\npower to make her amends for her preservation of them, to remember what\r\ndanger she had undergone for their sakes; for that if she had been\r\ncaught concealing them, she could not have escaped a terrible\r\ndestruction, she and all her family with her, and so bid them go home;\r\nand desired them to swear to her to preserve her and her family when\r\nthey should take the city, and destroy all its inhabitants, as they had\r\ndecreed to do; for so far she said she had been assured by those Divine\r\nmiracles of which she had been informed. So these spies acknowledged\r\nthat they owed her thanks for what she had done already, and withal\r\nswore to requite her kindness, not only in words, but in deeds. But they\r\ngave her this advice, That when she should perceive that the city was\r\nabout to be taken, she should put her goods, and all her family, by way\r\nof security, in her inn, and to hang out scarlet threads before her\r\ndoors, [or windows,] that the commander of the Hebrews might know her\r\nhouse, and take care to do her no harm; for, said they, we will inform\r\nhim of this matter, because of the concern thou hast had to preserve us:\r\nbut if any one of thy family fall in the battle, do not thou blame us;\r\nand we beseech that God, by whom we have sworn, not then to be\r\ndispleased with us, as though we had broken our oaths. So these men,\r\nwhen they had made this agreement, went away, letting themselves down by\r\na rope from the wall, and escaped, and came and told their own people\r\nwhatsoever they had done in their journey to this city. Joshua also told\r\nEleazar the high priest, and the senate, what the spies had sworn to\r\nRahab, who continued what had been sworn.\r\n\r\n3. Now while Joshua, the commander, was in fear about their passing over\r\nJordan, for the river ran with a strong current, and could not be passed\r\nover with bridges, for there never had been bridges laid over it\r\nhitherto; and while he suspected, that if he should attempt to make a\r\nbridge, that their enemies would not afford him time to perfect it, and\r\nfor ferry-boats they had none,-God promised so to dispose of the river,\r\nthat they might pass over it, and that by taking away the main part of\r\nits waters. So Joshua, after two days, caused the army and the whole\r\nmultitude to pass over in the manner following:—The priests went first\r\nof all, having the ark with them; then went the Levites bearing the\r\ntabernacle and the vessels which belonged to the sacrifices; after which\r\nthe entire multitude followed, according to their tribes, having their\r\nchildren and their wives in the midst of them, as being afraid for them,\r\nlest they should be borne away by the stream. But as soon as the priests\r\nhad entered the river first, it appeared fordable, the depth of the\r\nwater being restrained and the sand appearing at the bottom, because the\r\ncurrent was neither so strong nor so swift as to carry it away by its\r\nforce; so they all passed over the river without fear, finding it to be\r\nin the very same state as God had foretold he would put it in; but the\r\npriests stood still in the midst of the river till the multitude should\r\nbe passed over, and should get to the shore in safety; and when all were\r\ngone over, the priests came out also, and permitted the current to run\r\nfreely as it used to do before. Accordingly the river, as soon as the\r\nHebrews were come out of it, arose again presently, and came to its own\r\nproper magnitude as before.\r\n\r\n4. So the Hebrews went on farther fifty furlongs, and pitched their camp\r\nat the distance of ten furlongs from Jericho; but Joshua built an altar\r\nof those stones which all the heads of the tribes, at the command of the\r\nprophets, had taken out of the deep, to be afterwards a memorial of the\r\ndivision of the stream of this river, and upon it offered sacrifice to\r\nGod; and in that place celebrated the passover, and had great plenty of\r\nall the things which they wanted hitherto; for they reaped the corn of\r\nthe Canaanites, which was now ripe, and took other things as prey; for\r\nthen it was that their former food, which was manna, and of which they\r\nhad eaten forty years, failed them.\r\n\r\n5. Now while the Israelites did this, and the Canaanites did not attack\r\nthem, but kept themselves quiet within their own walls, Joshua resolved\r\nto besiege them; so on the first day of the feast [of the passover], the\r\npriests carried the ark round about, with some part of the armed men to\r\nbe a guard to it. These priests went forward, blowing with their seven\r\ntrumpets; and exhorted the army to be of good courage, and went round\r\nabout the city, with the senate following them; and when the priests had\r\nonly blown with the trumpets, for they did nothing more at all, they\r\nreturned to the camp. And when they had done this for six days, on the\r\nseventh Joshua gathered the armed men and all the people together, and\r\ntold them these good tidings, That the city should now be taken, since\r\nGod would on that day give it them, by the falling down of the walls,\r\nand this of their own accord, and without their labor. However, he\r\ncharged them to kill every one they should take, and not to abstain from\r\nthe slaughter of their enemies, either for weariness or for pity, and\r\nnot to fall on the spoil, and be thereby diverted from pursuing their\r\nenemies as they ran away; but to destroy all the animals, and to take\r\nnothing for their own peculiar advantage. He commanded them also to\r\nbring together all the silver and gold, that it might be set apart as\r\nfirst-fruits unto God out of this glorious exploit, as having gotten\r\nthem from the city they first took; only that they should save Rahab and\r\nher kindred alive, because of the oath which the spies had sworn to her.\r\n\r\n6. When he had said this, and had set his army in order, he brought it\r\nagainst the city: so they went round the city again, the ark going\r\nbefore them, and the priests encouraging the people to be zealous in the\r\nwork; and when they had gone round it seven times, and had stood still a\r\nlittle, the wall fell down, while no instruments of war, nor any other\r\nforce, was applied to it by the Hebrews.\r\n\r\n7. So they entered into Jericho, and slew all the men that were therein,\r\nwhile they were affrighted at the surprising overthrow of the walls, and\r\ntheir courage was become useless, and they were not able to defend\r\nthemselves; so they were slain, and their throats cut, some in the ways,\r\nand others as caught in their houses; nothing afforded them assistance,\r\nbut they all perished, even to the women and the children; and the city\r\nwas filled with dead bodies, and not one person escaped. They also burnt\r\nthe whole city, and the country about it; but they saved alive Rahab,\r\nwith her family, who had fled to her inn. And when she was brought to\r\nhim, Joshua owned to her that they owed her thanks for her preservation\r\nof the spies: so he said he would not appear to be behind her in his\r\nbenefaction to her; whereupon he gave her certain lands immediately, and\r\nhad her in great esteem ever afterwards.\r\n\r\n8. And if any part of the city escaped the fire, he overthrew it from\r\nthe foundation; and he denounced a curse 3against its inhabitants, if\r\nany should desire to rebuild it; how, upon his laying the foundation of\r\nthe walls, he should be deprived of his eldest son; and upon finishing\r\nit, he should lose his youngest son. But what happened hereupon we shall\r\nspeak of hereafter.\r\n\r\n9. Now there was an immense quantity of silver and gold, and besides\r\nthose of brass also, that was heaped together out of the city when it\r\nwas taken, no one transgressing the decree, nor purloining for their own\r\npeculiar advantage; which spoils Joshua delivered to the priests, to be\r\nlaid up among their treasures. And thus did Jericho perish.\r\n\r\n10. But there was one Achar, 4 the son [of Charmi, the son] of Zebedias,\r\nof the tribe of Judah, who finding a royal garment woven entirely of\r\ngold, and a piece of gold that weighed two hundred shekels; 5 and\r\nthinking it a very hard case, that what spoils he, by running some\r\nhazard, had found, he must give away, and offer it to God, who stood in\r\nno need of it, while he that wanted it must go without it,—made a deep\r\nditch in his own tent, and laid them up therein, as supposing he should\r\nnot only be concealed from his fellow soldiers, but from God himself\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n11. Now the place where Joshua pitched his camp was called Gilgal, which\r\ndenotes liberty; 6 for since now they had passed over Jordan, they\r\nlooked on themselves as freed from the miseries which they had undergone\r\nfrom the Egyptians, and in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n12. Now, a few days after the calamity that befell Jericho, Joshua sent\r\nthree thousand armed men to take Ai, a city situate above Jericho; but,\r\nupon the sight of the people of Ai, with them they were driven back, and\r\nlost thirty-six of their men. When this was told the Israelites, it made\r\nthem very sad, and exceeding disconsolate, not so much because of the\r\nrelation the men that were destroyed bare to them, though those that\r\nwere destroyed were all good men, and deserved their esteem, as by the\r\ndespair it occasioned; for while they believed that they were already,\r\nin effect, in possession of the land, and should bring back the army out\r\nof the battles without loss, as God had promised beforehand, they now\r\nsaw unexpectedly their enemies bold with success; so they put sackcloth\r\nover their garments, and continued in tears and lamentation all the day,\r\nwithout the least inquiry after food, but laid what had happened greatly\r\nto heart.\r\n\r\n13. When Joshua saw the army so much afflicted, and possessed with\r\nforebodings of evil as to their whole expedition, he used freedom with\r\nGod, and said, \"We are not come thus far out of any rashness of our own,\r\nas though we thought ourselves able to subdue this land with our own\r\nweapons, but at the instigation of Moses thy servant for this purpose,\r\nbecause thou hast promised us, by many signs, that thou wouldst give us\r\nthis land for a possession, and that thou wouldst make our army always\r\nsuperior in war to our enemies, and accordingly some success has already\r\nattended upon us agreeably to thy promises; but because we have now\r\nunexpectedly been foiled, and have lost some men out of our army, we are\r\ngrieved at it, as fearing what thou hast promised us, and what Moses\r\nforetold us, cannot be depended on by us; and our future expectation\r\ntroubles us the more, because we have met with such a disaster in this\r\nour first attempt. But do thou, O Lord, free us from these suspicions,\r\nfor thou art able to find a cure for these disorders, by giving us\r\nvictory, which will both take away the grief we are in at present, and\r\nprevent our distrust as to what is to come.\"\r\n\r\n14. These intercessions Joshua put up to God, as he lay prostrate on his\r\nface: whereupon God answered him, That he should rise up, and purify his\r\nhost from the pollution that had got into it; that \"things consecrated\r\nto me have been impudently stolen from me,\" and that \"this has been the\r\noccasion why this defeat had happened to them;\" and that when they\r\nshould search out and punish the offender, he would ever take care they\r\nshould have the victory over their enemies. This Joshua told the people;\r\nand calling for Eleazar the high priest, and the men in authority, he\r\ncast lots, tribe by tribe; and when the lot showed that this wicked\r\naction was done by one of the tribe of Judah, he then again proposed the\r\nlot to the several families thereto belonging; so the truth of this\r\nwicked action was found to belong to the family of Zachar; and when the\r\ninquiry was made man by man, they took Achar, who, upon God's reducing\r\nhim to a terrible extremity, could not deny the fact: so he confessed\r\nthe theft, and produced what he had taken in the midst of them,\r\nwhereupon he was immediately put to death; and attained no more than to\r\nbe buried in the night in a disgraceful manner, and such as was suitable\r\nto a condemned malefactor.\r\n\r\n15. When Joshua had thus purified the host, he led them against Ai: and\r\nhaving by night laid an ambush round about the city, he attacked the\r\nenemies as soon as it was day; but as they advanced boldly against the\r\nIsraelites, because of their former victory, he made them believe he\r\nretired, and by that means drew them a great way from the city, they\r\nstill supposing that they were pursuing their enemies, and despised\r\nthem, as though the case had been the same with that in the former\r\nbattle; after which Joshua ordered his forces to turn about, and placed\r\nthem against their front. He then made the signals agreed upon to those\r\nthat lay in ambush, and so excited them to fight; so they ran suddenly\r\ninto the city, the inhabitants being upon the walls, nay, others of them\r\nbeing in perplexity, and coming to see those that were without the\r\ngates. Accordingly, these men took the city, and slew all that they met\r\nwith; but Joshua forced those that came against him to come to a close\r\nfight, and discomfited them, and made them run away; and when they were\r\ndriven towards the city, and thought it had not been touched, as soon as\r\nthey saw it was taken, and perceived it was burnt, with their wives and\r\nchildren, they wandered about in the fields in a scattered condition,\r\nand were no way able to defend themselves, because they had none to\r\nsupport them. Now when this calamity was come upon the men of Ai, there\r\nwere a great number of children, and women, and servants, and an immense\r\nquantity of other furniture. The Hebrews also took herds of cattle, and\r\na great deal of money, for this was a rich country. So when Joshua came\r\nto Gilgal, he divided all these spoils among the soldiers.\r\n\r\n16. But the Gibeonites, who inhabited very near to Jerusalem, when they\r\nsaw what miseries had happened to the inhabitants of Jericho; and to\r\nthose of Ai, and suspected that the like sore calamity would come as far\r\nas themselves, they did not think fit to ask for mercy of Joshua; for\r\nthey supposed they should find little mercy from him, who made war that\r\nhe might entirely destroy the nation of the Canaanites; but they invited\r\nthe people of Cephirah and Kiriathjearim, who were their neighbors, to\r\njoin in league with them; and told them that neither could they\r\nthemselves avoid the danger they were all in, if the Israelites should\r\nprevent them, and seize upon them: so when they had persuaded them, they\r\nresolved to endeavor to escape the forces of the Israelites.\r\nAccordingly, upon their agreement to what they proposed, they sent\r\nambassadors to Joshua to make a league of friendship with him, and those\r\nsuch of the citizens as were best approved of, and most capable of doing\r\nwhat was most advantageous to the multitude. Now these ambassadors\r\nthought it dangerous to confess themselves to be Canaanites, but thought\r\nthey might by this contrivance avoid the danger, namely, by saying that\r\nthey bare no relation to the Canaanites at all, but dwelt at a very\r\ngreat distance from them: and they said further, that they came a long\r\nway, on account of the reputation he had gained for his virtue; and as a\r\nmark of the truth of what they said, they showed him the habit they were\r\nin, for that their clothes were new when they came out, but were greatly\r\nworn by the length of thee they had been on their journey; for indeed\r\nthey took torn garments, on purpose that they might make him believe so.\r\nSo they stood in the midst of the people, and said that they were sent\r\nby the people of Gibeon, and of the circumjacent cities, which were very\r\nremote from the land where they now were, to make such a league of\r\nfriendship with them, and this on such conditions as were customary\r\namong their forefathers; for when they understood that, by the favor of\r\nGod, and his gift to them, they were to have the possession of the land\r\nof Canaan bestowed upon them, they said that they were very glad to hear\r\nit, and desired to be admitted into the number of their citizens. Thus\r\ndid these ambassadors speak; and showing them the marks of their long\r\njourney, they entreated the Hebrews to make a league of friendship with\r\nthem. Accordingly Joshua, believing what they said, that they were not\r\nof the nation of the Canaanites, entered into friendship with them; and\r\nEleazar the high priest, with the senate, sware to them that they would\r\nesteem them their friends and associates, and would attempt nothing that\r\nshould be unfair against them, the multitude also assenting to the oaths\r\nthat were made to them. So these men, having obtained what they desired,\r\nby deceiving the Israelites, went home: but when Joshua led his army to\r\nthe country at the bottom of the mountains of this part of Canaan, he\r\nunderstood that the Gibeonites dwelt not far from Jerusalem, and that\r\nthey were of the stock of the Canaanites; so he sent for their\r\ngovernors, and reproached them with the cheat they had put upon him; but\r\nthey alleged, on their own behalf, that they had no other way to save\r\nthemselves but that, and were therefore forced to have recourse to it.\r\nSo he called for Eleazar the high priest, and for the senate, who\r\nthought it right to make them public servants, that they might not break\r\nthe oath they had made to them; and they ordained them to be so. And\r\nthis was the method by which these men found safety and security under\r\nthe calamity that was ready to overtake them.\r\n\r\n17. But the king of Jerusalem took it to heart that the Gibeonites had\r\ngone over to Joshua; so he called upon the kings of the neighboring\r\nnations to join together, and make war against them. Now when the\r\nGibeonites saw these kings, which were four, besides the king of\r\nJerusalem, and perceived that they had pitched their camp at a certain\r\nfountain not far from their city, and were getting ready for the siege\r\nof it, they called upon Joshua to assist them; for such was their case,\r\nas to expect to be destroyed by these Canaanites, but to suppose they\r\nshould be saved by those that came for the destruction of the\r\nCanaanites, because of the league of friendship that was between them.\r\nAccordingly, Joshua made haste with his whole army to assist them, and\r\nmarching day and night, in the morning he fell upon the enemies as they\r\nwere going up to the siege; and when he had discomfited them, he\r\nfollowed them, and pursued them down the descent of the hills. The place\r\nis called Bethhoron; where he also understood that God assisted him,\r\nwhich he declared by thunder and thunderbolts, as also by the falling of\r\nhail larger than usual. Moreover, it happened that the day was\r\nlengthened 7 that the night might not come on too soon, and be an\r\nobstruction to the zeal of the Hebrews in pursuing their enemies;\r\ninsomuch that Joshua took the kings, who were hidden in a certain cave\r\nat Makkedah, and put them to death. Now, that the day was lengthened at\r\nthis thee, and was longer than ordinary, is expressed in the books laid\r\nup in the temple.\r\n\r\n18. These kings which made war with, and were ready to fight the\r\nGibeonites, being thus overthrown, Joshua returned again to the\r\nmountainous parts of Canaan; and when he had made a great slaughter of\r\nthe people there, and took their prey, he came to the camp at Gilgal.\r\nAnd now there went a great fame abroad among the neighboring people of\r\nthe courage of the Hebrews; and those that heard what a number of men\r\nwere destroyed, were greatly affrighted at it: so the kings that lived\r\nabout Mount Libanus, who were Canaanites, and those Canaanites that\r\ndwelt in the plain country, with auxiliaries out of the land of the\r\nPhilistines, pitched their camp at Beroth, a city of the Upper Galilee,\r\nnot far from Cadesh, which is itself also a place in Galilee. Now the\r\nnumber of the whole army was three hundred thousand armed footmen, and\r\nten thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand chariots; so that the\r\nmultitude of the enemies affrighted both Joshua himself and the\r\nIsraelites; and they, instead of being full of hopes of good success,\r\nwere superstitiously timorous, with the great terror with which they\r\nwere stricken. Whereupon God upbraided them with the fear they were in,\r\nand asked them whether they desired a greater help than he could afford\r\nthem; and promised them that they should overcome their enemies; and\r\nwithal charged them to make their enemies' horses useless, and to burn\r\ntheir chariots. So Joshua became full of courage upon these promises of\r\nGod, and went out suddenly against the enemies; and after five days'\r\nmarch he came upon them, and joined battle with them, and there was a\r\nterrible fight, and such a number were slain as could not be believed by\r\nthose that heard it. He also went on in the pursuit a great way, and\r\ndestroyed the entire army of the enemies, few only excepted, and all the\r\nkings fell in the battle; insomuch, that when there wanted men to be\r\nkilled, Joshua slew their horses, and burnt their chariots and passed\r\nall over their country without opposition, no one daring to meet him in\r\nbattle; but he still went on, taking their cities by siege, and again\r\nkilling whatever he took.\r\n\r\n19. The fifth year was now past, and there was not one of the Canaanites\r\nremained any longer, excepting some that had retired to places of great\r\nstrength. So Joshua removed his camp to the mountainous country, and\r\nplaced the tabernacle in the city of Shiloh, for that seemed a fit place\r\nfor it, because of the beauty of its situation, until such thee as their\r\naffairs would permit them to build a temple; and from thence he went to\r\nShechem, together with all the people, and raised an altar where Moses\r\nhad beforehand directed; then did he divide the army, and placed one\r\nhalf of them on Mount Gerizzim, and the other half on Mount Ebal, on\r\nwhich mountain the altar was; he also placed there the tribe of Levi,\r\nand the priests. And when they had sacrificed, and denounced the\r\n[blessings and the] curses, and had left them engraven upon the altar,\r\nthey returned to Shiloh.\r\n\r\n20. And now Joshua was old, and saw that the cities of the Canaanites\r\nwere not easily to be taken, not only because they were situate in such\r\nstrong places, but because of the strength of the walls themselves,\r\nwhich being built round about, the natural strength of the places on\r\nwhich the cities stood, seemed capable of repelling their enemies from\r\nbesieging them, and of making those enemies despair of taking them; for\r\nwhen the Canaanites had learned that the Israelites came out of Egypt in\r\norder to destroy them, they were busy all that time in making their\r\ncities strong. So he gathered the people together to a congregation at\r\nShiloh; and when they, with great zeal and haste, were come thither, he\r\nobserved to them what prosperous successes they had already had, and\r\nwhat glorious things had been done, and those such as were worthy of\r\nthat God who enabled them to do those things, and worthy of the virtue\r\nof those laws which they followed. He took notice also, that thirty-one\r\nof those kings that ventured to give them battle were overcome, and\r\nevery army, how great soever it were, that confided in their own power,\r\nand fought with them, was utterly destroyed; so that not so much as any\r\nof their posterity remained. And as for the cities, since some of them\r\nwere taken, but the others must be taken in length of time, by long\r\nsieges, both on account of the strength of their walls, and of the\r\nconfidence the inhabitants had in them thereby, he thought it reasonable\r\nthat those tribes that came along with them from beyond Jordan, and had\r\npartaken of the dangers they had undergone, being their own kindred,\r\nshould now be dismissed and sent home, and should have thanks for the\r\npains they had taken together with them. As also, he thought it\r\nreasonable that they should send one man out of every tribe, and he such\r\nas had the testimony of extraordinary virtue, who should measure the\r\nland faithfully, and without any fallacy or deceit should inform them of\r\nits real magnitude.\r\n\r\n21. Now Joshua, when he had thus spoken to them, found that the\r\nmultitude approved of his proposal. So he sent men to measure their\r\ncountry, and sent with them some geometricians, who could not easily\r\nfail of knowing the truth, on account of their skill in that art. He\r\nalso gave them a charge to estimate the measure of that part of the land\r\nthat was most fruitful, and what was not so good: for such is the nature\r\nof the land of Canaan, that one may see large plains, and such as are\r\nexceeding fit to produce fruit, which yet, if they were compared to\r\nother parts of the country, might be reckoned exceedingly fruitful; yet,\r\nif it be compared with the fields about Jericho, and to those that\r\nbelong to Jerusalem, will appear to be of no account at all; and\r\nalthough it so falls out that these people have but a very little of\r\nthis sort of land, and that it is, for the main, mountainous also, yet\r\ndoes it not come behind other parts, on account of its exceeding\r\ngoodness and beauty; for which reason Joshua thought the land for the\r\ntribes should be divided by estimation of its goodness, rather than the\r\nlargeness of its measure, it often happening that one acre of some sort\r\nof land was equivalent to a thousand other acres. Now the men that were\r\nsent, which were in number ten, traveled all about, and made an\r\nestimation of the land, and in the seventh month came to him to the city\r\nof Shiloh, where they had set up the tabernacle.\r\n\r\n22. So Joshua took both Eleazar and the senate, and with them the heads\r\nof the tribes, and distributed the land to the nine tribes, and to the\r\nhalf-tribe of Manasseh, appointing the dimensions to be according to the\r\nlargeness of each tribe. So when he had cast lots, Judah had assigned\r\nhim by lot the upper part of Judea, reaching as far as Jerusalem, and\r\nits breadth extended to the Lake of Sodom. Now in the lot of this tribe\r\nthere were the cities of Askelon and Gaza. The lot of Simeon, which was\r\nthe second, included that part of Idumea which bordered upon Egypt and\r\nArabia. As to the Benjamites, their lot fell so, that its length reached\r\nfrom the river Jordan to the sea, but in breadth it was bounded by\r\nJerusalem and Bethel; and this lot was the narrowest of all, by reason\r\nof the goodness of the land, for it included Jericho and the city of\r\nJerusalem. The tribe of Ephraim had by lot the land that extended in\r\nlength from the river Jordan to Gezer; but in breadth as far as from\r\nBethel, till it ended at the Great Plain. The half-tribe of Manasseh had\r\nthe land from Jordan to the city of Dora; but its breadth was at\r\nBethsham, which is now called Scythopolis. And after these was Issachar,\r\nwhich had its limits in length, Mount Carmel and the river, but its\r\nlimit in breadth was Mount Tabor. The tribe of Zebulon's lot included\r\nthe land which lay as far as the Lake of Genesareth, and that which\r\nbelonged to Carmel and the sea. The tribe of Aser had that part which\r\nwas called the Valley, for such it was, and all that part which lay\r\nover-against Sidon. The city Arce belonged to their share, which is also\r\nnamed Actipus. The Naphthalites received the eastern parts, as far as\r\nthe city of Damascus and the Upper Galilee, unto Mount Libanus, and the\r\nFountains of Jordan, which rise out of that mountain; that is, out of\r\nthat part of it whose limits belong to the neighboring city of Arce. The\r\nDanites' lot included all that part of the valley which respects the\r\nsun-setting, and were bounded by Azotus and Dora; as also they had all\r\nJamnia and Gath, from Ekron to that mountain where the tribe of Judah\r\nbegins.\r\n\r\n23. After this manner did Joshua divide the six nations that bear the\r\nname of the sons of Canaan, with their land, to be possessed by the nine\r\ntribes and a half; for Moses had prevented him, and had already\r\ndistributed the land of the Amorites, which itself was so called also\r\nfrom one of the sons of Canaan, to the two tribes and a half, as we have\r\nshown already. But the parts about Sidon, as also those that belonged to\r\nthe Arkites, and the Amathites, and the Aradians, were not yet regularly\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\n24. But now was Joshua hindered by his age from executing what he\r\nintended to do [as did those that succeeded him in the government, take\r\nlittle care of what was for the advantage of the public]; so he gave it\r\nin charge to every tribe to leave no remainder of the race of the\r\nCanaanites in the land that had been divided to them by lot; that Moses\r\nhad assured them beforehand, and they might rest fully satisfied about\r\nit, that their own security and their observation of their own laws\r\ndepended wholly upon it. Moreover, he enjoined them to give thirty-eight\r\ncities to the Levites, for they had already received ten in the country\r\nof the Amorites; and three of these he assigned to those that fled from\r\nthe man-slayers, who were to inhabit there; for he was very solicitous\r\nthat nothing should be neglected which Moses had ordained. These cities\r\nwere, of the tribe of Judah, Hebron; of that of Ephraim, Shechem; and of\r\nthat of Naphthali, Cadesh, which is a place of the Upper Galilee. He\r\nalso distributed among them the rest of the prey not yet distributed,\r\nwhich was very great; whereby they had an affluence of great riches,\r\nboth all in general, and every one in particular; and this of gold and\r\nof vestments, and of other furniture, besides a multitude of cattle,\r\nwhose number could not be told.\r\n\r\n25. After this was over, he gathered the army together to a\r\ncongregation, and spake thus to those tribes that had their settlement\r\nin the land of the Amorites beyond Jordan,—for fifty thousand of them\r\nhad armed themselves, and had gone to the war along with them:—\"Since\r\nthat God, who is the Father and Lord of the Hebrew nation, has now given\r\nus this land for a possession, and promised to preserve us in the\r\nenjoyment of it as our own for ever; and since you have with alacrity\r\noffered yourselves to assist us when we wanted that assistance on all\r\noccasions, according to his command; it is but just, now all our\r\ndifficulties are over, that you should be permitted to enjoy rest, and\r\nthat we should trespass on your alacrity to help us no longer; that so,\r\nif we should again stand in need of it, we may readily have it on any\r\nfuture emergency, and not tire you out so much now as may make you\r\nslower in assisting us another time. We, therefore, return you our\r\nthanks for the dangers you have undergone with us, and we do it not at\r\nthis time only, but we shall always be thus disposed; and be so good as\r\nto remember our friends, and to preserve in mind what advantages we have\r\nhad from them; and how you have put off the enjoyments of your own\r\nhappiness for our sakes, and have labored for what we have now, by the\r\ngoodwill of God, obtained, and resolved not to enjoy your own prosperity\r\ntill you had afforded us that assistance. However, you have, by joining\r\nyour labor with ours, gotten great plenty of riches, and will carry home\r\nwith you much prey, with gold and silver, and, what is more than all\r\nthese, our good-will towards you, and a mind willingly disposed to make\r\na requital of your kindness to us, in what case soever you shall desire\r\nit, for you have not omitted any thing which Moses beforehand required\r\nof you, nor have you despised him because he was dead and gone from you,\r\nso that there is nothing to diminish that gratitude which we owe to you.\r\nWe therefore dismiss you joyful to your own inheritances; and we entreat\r\nyou to suppose, that there is no limit to be set to the intimate\r\nrelation that is between us; and that you will not imagine, because this\r\nriver is interposed between us, that you are of a different race from\r\nus, and not Hebrews; for we are all the posterity of Abraham, both we\r\nthat inhabit here, and you that inhabit there; and it is the same God\r\nthat brought our forefathers and yours into the world, whose worship and\r\nform of government we are to take care of, which he has ordained, and\r\nare most carefully to observe; because while you continue in those laws,\r\nGod will also show himself merciful and assisting to you; but if you\r\nimitate the other nations, and forsake those laws, he will reject your\r\nnation.\" When Joshua had spoken thus, and saluted them all, both those\r\nin authority one by one, and the whole multitude in common, he himself\r\nstaid where he was; but the people conducted those tribes on their\r\njourney, and that not without tears in their eyes; and indeed they\r\nhardly knew how to part one from the other.\r\n\r\n26. Now when the tribe of Reuben, and that of Gad, and as many of the\r\nManassites as followed them, were passed over the river, they built an\r\naltar on the banks of Jordan, as a monument to posterity, and a sign of\r\ntheir relation to those that should inhabit on the other side. But when\r\nthose on the other side heard that those who had been dismissed had\r\nbuilt an altar, but did not hear with what intention they built it, but\r\nsupposed it to be by way of innovation, and for the introduction of\r\nstrange gods, they did not incline to disbelieve it; but thinking this\r\ndefamatory report, as if it were built for divine worship, was credible,\r\nthey appeared in arms, as though they would avenge themselves on those\r\nthat built the altar; and they were about to pass over the river, and to\r\npunish them for their subversion of the laws of their country; for they\r\ndid not think it fit to regard them on account of their kindred or the\r\ndignity of those that had given the occasion, but to regard the will of\r\nGod, and the manner wherein he desired to be worshipped; so these men\r\nput themselves in array for war. But Joshua, and Eleazar the high\r\npriest, and the senate, restrained them; and persuaded them first to\r\nmake trial by words of their intention, and afterwards, if they found\r\nthat their intention was evil, then only to proceed to make war upon\r\nthem. Accordingly, they sent as ambassadors to them Phineas the son of\r\nEleazar, and ten more persons that were in esteem among the Hebrews, to\r\nlearn of them what was in their mind, when, upon passing over the river,\r\nthey had built an altar upon its banks. And as soon as these ambassadors\r\nwere passed over, and were come to them, and a congregation was\r\nassembled, Phineas stood up and said, That the offense they had been\r\nguilty of was of too heinous a nature to be punished by words alone, or\r\nby them only to be amended for the future; yet that they did not so look\r\nat the heinousness of their transgression as to have recourse to arms,\r\nand to a battle for their punishment immediately, but that, on account\r\nof their kindred, and the probability there was that they might be\r\nreclaimed, they took this method of sending an ambassage to them: \"That\r\nwhen we have learned the true reasons by which you have been moved to\r\nbuild this altar, we may neither seem to have been too rash in\r\nassaulting you by our weapons of war, if it prove that you made the\r\naltar for justifiable reasons, and may then justly punish you if the\r\naccusation prove true; for we can hardly hardly suppose that you, have\r\nbeen acquainted with the will of God and have been hearers of those laws\r\nwhich he himself hath given us, now you are separated from us, and gone\r\nto that patrimony of yours, which you, through the grace of God, and\r\nthat providence which he exercises over you, have obtained by lot, can\r\nforget him, and can leave that ark and that altar which is peculiar to\r\nus, and can introduce strange gods, and imitate the wicked practices of\r\nthe Canaanites. Now this will appear to have been a small crime if you\r\nrepent now, and proceed no further in your madness, but pay a due\r\nreverence to, and keep in mind the laws of your country; but if you\r\npersist in your sins, we will not grudge our pains to preserve our laws;\r\nbut we will pass over Jordan and defend them, and defend God also, and\r\nshall esteem of you as of men no way differing from the Canaanites, but\r\nshall destroy you in the like manner as we destroyed them; for do not\r\nyou imagine that, because you are got over the river, you are got out of\r\nthe reach of God's power; you are every where in places that belong to\r\nhim, and impossible it is to overrun his power, and the punishment he\r\nwill bring on men thereby: but if you think that your settlement here\r\nwill be any obstruction to your conversion to what is good, nothing need\r\nhinder us from dividing the land anew, and leaving this old land to be\r\nfor the feeding of sheep; but you will do well to return to your duty,\r\nand to leave off these new crimes; and we beseech you, by your children\r\nand wives, not to force us to punish you. Take therefore such measures\r\nin this assembly, as supposing that your own safety, and the safety of\r\nthose that are dearest to you, is therein concerned, and believe that it\r\nis better for you to be conquered by words, than to continue in your\r\npurpose, and to experience deeds and war therefore.\"\r\n\r\n27. When Phineas had discoursed thus, the governors of the assembly, and\r\nthe whole multitude, began to make an apology for themselves, concerning\r\nwhat they were accused of; and they said, That they neither would depart\r\nfrom the relation they bare to them, nor had they built the altar by way\r\nof innovation; that they owned one and the same common God with all the\r\nHebrews, and that brazen altar which was before the tabernacle, on which\r\nthey would offer their sacrifices; that as to the altar they had raised,\r\non account of which they were thus suspected, it was not built for\r\nworship, \"but that it might be a sign and a monument of our relation to\r\nyou for ever, and a necessary caution to us to act wisely, and to\r\ncontinue in the laws of our country, but not a handle for transgressing\r\nthem, as you suspect: and let God be our authentic witness, that this\r\nwas the occasion of our building this altar: whence we beg you will have\r\na better opinion of us, and do not impute such a thing to us as would\r\nrender any of the posterity of Abraham well worthy of perdition, in case\r\nthey attempt to bring in new rites, and such as are different from our\r\nusual practices.\"\r\n\r\n28. When they had made this answer, and Phineas had commended them for\r\nit, he came to Joshua, and explained before the people what answer they\r\nhad received. Now Joshua was glad that he was under no necessity of\r\nsetting them in array, or of leading them to shed blood, and make war\r\nagainst men of their own kindred; and accordingly he offered sacrifices\r\nof thanksgiving to God for the same. So Joshua after that dissolved this\r\ngreat assembly of the people, and sent them to their own inheritances,\r\nwhile he himself lived in Shechem. But in the twentieth year after this,\r\nwhen he was very old, he sent for those of the greatest dignity in the\r\nseveral cities, with those in authority, and the senate, and as many of\r\nthe common people as could be present; and when they were come, he put\r\nthem in mind of all the benefits God had bestowed on them, which could\r\nnot but be a great many, since from a low estate they were advanced to\r\nso great a degree of glory and plenty; and exhorted them to take notice\r\nof the intentions of God, which had been so gracious towards them; and\r\ntold them that the Deity would continue their friend by nothing else but\r\ntheir piety; and that it was proper for him, now that he was about to\r\ndepart out of this life, to leave such an admonition to them; and he\r\ndesired that they would keep in memory this his exhortation to them.\r\n\r\n29. So Joshua, when he had thus discoursed to them, died, having lived a\r\nhundred and ten years; forty of which he lived with Moses, in order to\r\nlearn what might be for his advantage afterwards. He also became their\r\ncommander after his death for twenty-five years. He was a man that\r\nwanted not wisdom nor eloquence to declare his intentions to the people,\r\nbut very eminent on both accounts. He was of great courage and\r\nmagnanimity in action and in dangers, and very sagacious in procuring\r\nthe peace of the people, and of great virtue at all proper seasons. He\r\nwas buried in the city of Timnab, of the tribe of Ephraim 9 About the\r\nsame time died Eleazar the high priest, leaving the high priesthood to\r\nhis son Phineas. His monument also, and sepulcher, are in the city of\r\nGabatha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How, After The Death Of Joshua Their Commander, The\r\nIsraelites Transgressed The Laws Of Their Country, And Experienced Great\r\nAfflictions; And When There Was A Sedition Arisen, The Tribe Of Benjamin\r\nWas Destroyed Excepting Only Six Hundred Men.\r\n\r\n1. After the death of Joshua and Eleazar, Phineas prophesied, 10 that\r\naccording to God's will they should commit the government to the tribe\r\nof Judah, and that this tribe should destroy the race of the Canaanites;\r\nfor then the people were concerned to learn what was the will of God.\r\nThey also took to their assistance the tribe of Simeon; but upon this\r\ncondition, that when those that had been tributary to the tribe of Judah\r\nshould be slain, they should do the like for the tribe of Simeon.\r\n\r\n2. But the affairs of the Canaanites were at this time in a flourishing\r\ncondition, and they expected the Israelites with a great army at the\r\ncity Bezek, having put the government into the hands of Adonibezek,\r\nwhich name denotes the Lord of Bezek, for Adoni in the Hebrew tongue\r\nsignifies Lord. Now they hoped to have been too hard for the Israelites,\r\nbecause Joshua was dead; but when the Israelites had joined battle with\r\nthem, I mean the two tribes before mentioned, they fought gloriously,\r\nand slew above ten thousand of them, and put the rest to flight; and in\r\nthe pursuit they took Adonibezek, who, when his fingers and toes were\r\ncut off by them, said, \"Nay, indeed, I was not always to lie concealed\r\nfrom God, as I find by what I now endure, while I have not been ashamed\r\nto do the same to seventy-two kings.\" 11 So they carried him alive as\r\nfar as Jerusalem; and when he was dead, they buried him in the earth,\r\nand went on still in taking the cities: and when they had taken the\r\ngreatest part of them, they besieged Jerusalem; and when they had taken\r\nthe lower city, which was not under a considerable time, they slew all\r\nthe inhabitants; but the upper city was not to be taken without great\r\ndifficulty, through the strength of its walls, and the nature of the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n3. For which reason they removed their camp to Hebron; and when they had\r\ntaken it, they slew all the inhabitants. There were till then left the\r\nrace of giants, who had bodies so large, and countenances so entirely\r\ndifferent from other men, that they were surprising to the sight, and\r\nterrible to the hearing. The bones of these men are still shown to this\r\nvery day, unlike to any credible relations of other men. Now they gave\r\nthis city to the Levites as an extraordinary reward, with the suburbs of\r\ntwo thousand cities; but the land thereto belonging they gave as a free\r\ngift to Caleb, according to the injunctions of Moses. This Caleb was one\r\nof the spies which Moses sent into the land of Canaan. They also gave\r\nland for habitation to the posterity of Jethro, the Midianite, who was\r\nthe father-in-law to Moses; for they had left their own country, and\r\nfollowed them, and accompanied them in the wilderness.\r\n\r\n4. Now the tribes of Judah and Simeon took the cities which were in the\r\nmountainous part of Canaan, as also Askelon and Ashdod, of those that\r\nlay near the sea; but Gaza and Ekron escaped them, for they, lying in a\r\nflat country, and having a great number of chariots, sorely galled those\r\nthat attacked them. So these tribes, when they were grown very rich by\r\nthis war, retired to their own cities, and laid aside their weapons of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n5. But the Benjamites, to whom belonged Jerusalem, permitted its\r\ninhabitants to pay tribute. So they all left off, the one to kill, and\r\nthe other to expose themselves to danger, and had time to cultivate the\r\nground. The rest of the tribes imitated that of Benjamin, and did the\r\nsame; and, contenting themselves with the tributes that were paid them,\r\npermitted the Canaanites to live in peace.\r\n\r\n6. However, the tribe of Ephraim, when they besieged Bethel, made no\r\nadvance, nor performed any thing worthy of the time they spent, and of\r\nthe pains they took about that siege; yet did they persist in it, still\r\nsitting down before the city, though they endured great trouble thereby:\r\nbut, after some time, they caught one of the citizens that came to them\r\nto get necessaries, and they gave him some assurances that, if he would\r\ndeliver up the city to them, they would preserve him and his kindred; so\r\nhe aware that, upon those terms, he would put the city into their hands.\r\nAccordingly, he that, thus betrayed the city was preserved with his\r\nfamily; and the Israelites slew all the inhabitants, and retained the\r\ncity for themselves.\r\n\r\n7. After this, the Israelites grew effeminate as to fighting any more\r\nagainst their enemies, but applied themselves to the cultivation of the\r\nland, which producing them great plenty and riches, they neglected the\r\nregular disposition of their settlement, and indulged themselves in\r\nluxury and pleasures; nor were they any longer careful to hear the laws\r\nthat belonged to their political government: whereupon God was provoked\r\nto anger, and put them in mind, first, how, contrary to his directions,\r\nthey had spared the Canaanites; and, after that, how those Canaanites,\r\nas opportunity served, used them very barbarously. But the Israelites,\r\nthough they were in heaviness at these admonitions from God, yet were\r\nthey still very unwilling to go to war; and since they got large\r\ntributes from the Canaanites, and were indisposed for taking pains by\r\ntheir luxury, they suffered their aristocracy to be corrupted also, and\r\ndid not ordain themselves a senate, nor any other such magistrates as\r\ntheir laws had formerly required, but they were very much given to\r\ncultivating their fields, in order to get wealth; which great indolence\r\nof theirs brought a terrible sedition upon them, and they proceeded so\r\nfar as to fight one against another, from the following occasion:—\r\n\r\n8. There was a Levite 12 a man of a vulgar family, that belonged to the\r\ntribe of Ephraim, and dwelt therein: this man married a wife from\r\nBethlehem, which is a place belonging to the tribe of Judah. Now he was\r\nvery fond of his wife, and overcome with her beauty; but he was unhappy\r\nin this, that he did not meet with the like return of affection from\r\nher, for she was averse to him, which did more inflame his passion for\r\nher, so that they quarreled one with another perpetually; and at last\r\nthe woman was so disgusted at these quarrels, that she left her husband,\r\nand went to her parents in the fourth month. The husband being very\r\nuneasy at this her departure, and that out of his fondness for her, came\r\nto his father and mother-in-law, and made up their quarrels, and was\r\nreconciled to her, and lived with them there four days, as being kindly\r\ntreated by her parents. On the fifth day he resolved to go home, and\r\nwent away in the evening; for his wife's parents were loath to part with\r\ntheir daughter, and delayed the time till the day was gone. Now they had\r\none servant that followed them, and an ass on which the woman rode; and\r\nwhen they were near Jerusalem, having gone already thirty furlongs, the\r\nservant advised them to take up their lodgings some where, lest some\r\nmisfortune should befall them if they traveled in the night, especially\r\nsince they were not far off enemies, that season often giving reason for\r\nsuspicion of dangers from even such as are friends; but the husband was\r\nnot pleased with this advice, nor was he willing to take up his lodging\r\namong strangers, for the city belonged to the Canaanites, but desired\r\nrather to go twenty furlongs farther, and so to take their lodgings in\r\nsome Israelite city. Accordingly, he obtained his purpose, and came to\r\nGibeah, a city of the tribe of Benjamin, when it was just dark; and\r\nwhile no one that lived in the market-place invited him to lodge with\r\nhim, there came an old man out of the field, one that was indeed of the\r\ntribe of Ephraim, but resided in Gibeah, and met him, and asked him who\r\nhe was, and for what reason he came thither so late, and why he was\r\nlooking out for provisions for supper when it was dark? To which he\r\nreplied, that he was a Levite, and was bringing his wife from her\r\nparents, and was going home; but he told him his habitation was in the\r\ntribe of Ephraim: so the old man, as well because of their kindred as\r\nbecause they lived in the same tribe, and also because they had thus\r\naccidentally met together, took him in to lodge with him. Now certain\r\nyoung men of the inhabitants of Gibeah, having seen the woman in the\r\nmarket-place, and admiring her beauty, when they understood that she\r\nlodged with the old man, came to the doors, as contemning the weakness\r\nand fewness of the old man's family; and when the old man desired them\r\nto go away, and not to offer any violence or abuse there, they desired\r\nhim to yield them up the strange woman, and then he should have no harm\r\ndone to him: and when the old man alleged that the Levite was of his\r\nkindred, and that they would be guilty of horrid wickedness if they\r\nsuffered themselves to be overcome by their pleasures, and so offend\r\nagainst their laws, they despised his righteous admonition, and laughed\r\nhim to scorn. They also threatened to kill him if he became an obstacle\r\nto their inclinations; whereupon, when he found himself in great\r\ndistress, and yet was not willing to overlook his guests, and see them\r\nabused, he produced his own daughter to them; and told them that it was\r\na smaller breach of the law to satisfy their lust upon her, than to\r\nabuse his guests, supposing that he himself should by this means prevent\r\nany injury to be done to those guests. When they no way abated of their\r\nearnestness for the strange woman, but insisted absolutely on their\r\ndesires to have her, he entreated them not to perpetrate any such act of\r\ninjustice; but they proceeded to take her away by force, and indulging\r\nstill more the violence of their inclinations, they took the woman away\r\nto their house, and when they had satisfied their lust upon her the\r\nwhole night, they let her go about daybreak. So she came to the place\r\nwhere she had been entertained, under great affliction at what had\r\nhappened; and was very sorrowful upon occasion of what she had suffered,\r\nand durst not look her husband in the face for shame, for she concluded\r\nthat he would never forgive her for what she had done; so she fell down,\r\nand gave up the ghost: but her husband supposed that his wife was only\r\nfast asleep, and, thinking nothing of a more melancholy nature had\r\nhappened, endeavored to raise her up, resolving to speak comfortably to\r\nher, since she did not voluntarily expose herself to these men's lust,\r\nbut was forced away to their house; but as soon as he perceived she was\r\ndead, he acted as prudently as the greatness of his misfortunes would\r\nadmit, and laid his dead wife upon the beast, and carried her home; and\r\ncutting her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, he sent them to every\r\ntribe, and gave it in charge to those that carried them, to inform the\r\ntribes of those that were the causes of his wife's death, and of the\r\nviolence they had offered to her.\r\n\r\n9. Upon this the people were greatly disturbed at what they saw, and at\r\nwhat they heard, as never having had the experience of such a thing\r\nbefore; so they gathered themselves to Shiloh, out of a prodigious and a\r\njust anger, and assembling in a great congregation before the\r\ntabernacle, they immediately resolved to take arms, and to treat the\r\ninhabitants of Gibeah as enemies; but the senate restrained them from\r\ndoing so, and persuaded them, that they ought not so hastily to make war\r\nupon people of the same nation with them, before they discoursed them by\r\nwords concerning the accusation laid against them; it being part of\r\ntheir law, that they should not bring an army against foreigners\r\nthemselves, when they appear to have been injurious, without sending an\r\nambassage first, and trying thereby whether they will repent or not: and\r\naccordingly they exhorted them to do what they ought to do in obedience\r\nto their laws, that is, to send to the inhabitants of Gibeah, to know\r\nwhether they would deliver up the offenders to them, and if they deliver\r\nthem up, to rest satisfied with the punishment of those offenders; but\r\nif they despised the message that was sent them, to punish them by\r\ntaking, up arms against them. Accordingly they sent to the inhabitants\r\nof Gibeah, and accused the young men of the crimes committed in the\r\naffair of the Levite's wife, and required of them those that had done\r\nwhat was contrary to the law, that they might be punished, as having\r\njustly deserved to die for what they had done; but the inhabitants of\r\nGibeah would not deliver up the young men, and thought it too\r\nreproachful to them, out of fear of war, to submit to other men's\r\ndemands upon them; vaunting themselves to be no way inferior to any in\r\nwar, neither in their number nor in courage. The rest of their tribe\r\nwere also making great preparation for war, for they were so insolently\r\nmad as also to resolve to repel force by force.\r\n\r\n10. When it was related to the Israelites what the inhabitants of Gibeah\r\nhad resolved upon, they took their oath that no one of them would give\r\nhis daughter in marriage to a Benjamite, but make war with greater fury\r\nagainst them than we have learned our forefathers made war against the\r\nCanaanites; and sent out presently an army of four hundred thousand\r\nagainst them, while the Benjamites' army-was twenty-five thousand and\r\nsix hundred; five hundred of whom were excellent at slinging stones with\r\ntheir left hands, insomuch that when the battle was joined at Gibeah the\r\nBenjamites beat the Israelites, and of them there fell two thousand men;\r\nand probably more had been destroyed had not the night came on and\r\nprevented it, and broken off the fight; so the Benjamites returned to\r\nthe city with joy, and the Israelites returned to their camp in a great\r\nfright at what had happened. On the next day, when they fought again,\r\nthe Benjamites beat them; and eighteen thousand of the Israelites were\r\nslain, and the rest deserted their camp out of fear of a greater\r\nslaughter. So they came to Bethel, 13 a city that was near their camp,\r\nand fasted on the next day; and besought God, by Phineas the high\r\npriest, that his wrath against them might cease, and that he would be\r\nsatisfied with these two defeats, and give them the victory and power\r\nover their enemies. Accordingly God promised them so to do, by the\r\nprophesying of Phineas.\r\n\r\n11. When therefore they had divided the army into two parts, they laid\r\nthe one half of them in ambush about the city Gibeah by night, while the\r\nother half attacked the Benjamites, who retiring upon the assault, the\r\nBenjamites pursued them, while the Hebrews retired by slow degrees, as\r\nvery desirous to draw them entirely from the city; and the other\r\nfollowed them as they retired, till both the old men and the young men\r\nthat were left in the city, as too weak to fight, came running out\r\ntogether with them, as willing to bring their enemies under. However,\r\nwhen they were a great way from the city the Hebrews ran away no longer,\r\nbut turned back to fight them, and lifted up the signal they had agreed\r\non to those that lay in ambush, who rose up, and with a great noise fell\r\nupon the enemy. Now, as soon as ever they perceived themselves to be\r\ndeceived, they knew not what to do; and when they were driven into a\r\ncertain hollow place which was in a valley, they were shot at by those\r\nthat encompassed them, till they were all destroyed, excepting six\r\nhundred, which formed themselves into a close body of men, and forced\r\ntheir passage through the midst of their enemies, and fled to the\r\nneighboring mountains, and, seizing upon them, remained there; but the\r\nrest of them, being about twenty-five thousand, were slain. Then did the\r\nIsraelites burn Gibeah, and slew the women, and the males that were\r\nunder age; and did the same also to the other cities of the Benjamites;\r\nand, indeed, they were enraged to that degree, that they sent twelve\r\nthousand men out of the army, and gave them orders to destroy Jabesh\r\nGilead, because it did not join with them in fighting against the\r\nBenjamites. Accordingly, those that were sent slew the men of war, with\r\ntheir children and wives, excepting four hundred virgins. To such a\r\ndegree had they proceeded in their anger, because they not only had the\r\nsuffering of the Levite's wife to avenge, but the slaughter of their own\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n12. However, they afterward were sorry for the calamity they had brought\r\nupon the Benjamites, and appointed a fast on that account, although they\r\nsupposed those men had suffered justly for their offense against the\r\nlaws; so they recalled by their ambassadors those six hundred which had\r\nescaped. These had seated themselves on a certain rock called Rimmon,\r\nwhich was in the wilderness. So the ambassadors lamented not only the\r\ndisaster that had befallen the Benjamites, but themselves also, by this\r\ndestruction of their kindred; and persuaded them to take it patiently;\r\nand to come and unite with them, and not, so far as in them lay, to give\r\ntheir suffrage to the utter destruction of the tribe of Benjamin; and\r\nsaid to them, \"We give you leave to take the whole land of Benjamin to\r\nyourselves, and as much prey as you are able to carry away with you.\" So\r\nthese men with sorrow confessed, that what had been done was according\r\nto the decree of God, and had happened for their own wickedness; and\r\nassented to those that invited them, and came down to their own tribe.\r\nThe Israelites also gave them the four hundred virgins of Jabesh Gilead\r\nfor wives; but as to the remaining two hundred, they deliberated about\r\nit how they might compass wives enough for them, and that they might\r\nhave children by them; and whereas they had, before the war began, taken\r\nan oath, that no one would give his daughter to wife to a Benjamite,\r\nsome advised them to have no regard to what they had sworn, because the\r\noath had not been taken advisedly and judiciously, but in a passion, and\r\nthought that they should do nothing against God, if they were able to\r\nsave a whole tribe which was in danger of perishing; and that perjury\r\nwas then a sad and dangerous thing, not when it is done out of\r\nnecessity, but when it is done with a wicked intention. But when the\r\nsenate were affrighted at the very name of perjury, a certain person\r\ntold them that he could show them a way whereby they might procure the\r\nBenjamites wives enough, and yet keep their oath. They asked him what\r\nhis proposal was. He said, \"That three times in a year, when we meet in\r\nShiloh, our wives and our daughters accompany us: let then the\r\nBenjamites be allowed to steal away, and marry such women as they can\r\ncatch, while we will neither incite them nor forbid them; and when their\r\nparents take it ill, and desire us to inflict punishment upon them, we\r\nwill tell them, that they were themselves the cause of what had\r\nhappened, by neglecting to guard their daughters, and that they ought\r\nnot to be over angry at the Benjamites, since that anger was permitted\r\nto rise too high already.\" So the Israelites were persuaded to follow\r\nthis advice, and decreed, That the Benjamites should be allowed thus to\r\nsteal themselves wives. So when the festival was coming on, these two\r\nhundred Benjamites lay in ambush before the city, by two and three\r\ntogether, and waited for the coming of the virgins, in the vineyards and\r\nother places where they could lie concealed. Accordingly the virgins\r\ncame along playing, and suspected nothing of what was coming upon them,\r\nand walked after an unguarded manner, so those that laid scattered in\r\nthe road, rose up, and caught hold of them: by this means these\r\nBenjamites got them wives, and fell to agriculture, and took good care\r\nto recover their former happy state. And thus was this tribe of the\r\nBenjamites, after they had been in danger of entirely perishing, saved\r\nin the manner forementioned, by the wisdom of the Israelites; and\r\naccordingly it presently flourished, and soon increased to be a\r\nmultitude, and came to enjoy all other degrees of happiness. And such\r\nwas the conclusion of this war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How The Israelites After This Misfortune Grew Wicked And\r\nServed The Assyrians; And How God Delivered Them By Othniel, Who Ruled\r\nOver The Forty Years.\r\n\r\n1. Now it happened that the tribe of Dan suffered in like manner with\r\nthe tribe of Benjamin; and it came to do so on the occasion\r\nfollowing:—When the Israelites had already left off the exercise of\r\ntheir arms for war, and were intent upon their husbandry, the Canaanites\r\ndespised them, and brought together an army, not because they expected\r\nto suffer by them, but because they had a mind to have a sure prospect\r\nof treating the Hebrews ill when they pleased, and might thereby for the\r\ntime to come dwell in their own cities the more securely; they prepared\r\ntherefore their chariots, and gathered their soldiery together, their\r\ncities also combined together, and drew over to them Askelon and Ekron,\r\nwhich were within the tribe of Judah, and many more of those that lay in\r\nthe plain. They also forced the Danites to fly into the mountainous\r\ncountry, and left them not the least portion of the plain country to set\r\ntheir foot on. Since then these Danites were not able to fight them, and\r\nhad not land enough to sustain them, they sent five of their men into\r\nthe midland country, to seek for a land to which they might remove their\r\nhabitation. So these men went as far as the neighborhood of Mount\r\nLibanus, and the fountains of the Lesser Jordan, at the great plain of\r\nSidon, a day's journey from the city; and when they had taken a view of\r\nthe land, and found it to be good and exceeding fruitful, they\r\nacquainted their tribe with it, whereupon they made an expedition with\r\nthe army, and built there the city Dan, of the same name with the son of\r\nJacob, and of the same name with their own tribe.\r\n\r\n2. The Israelites grew so indolent, and unready of taking pains, that\r\nmisfortunes came heavier upon them, which also proceeded in part from\r\ntheir contempt of the Divine worship; for when they had once fallen off\r\nfrom the regularity of their political government, they indulged\r\nthemselves further in living according to their own pleasure, and\r\naccording to their own will, till they were full of the evil doings that\r\nwere common among the Canaanites. God therefore was angry with them, and\r\nthey lost that their happy state which they had obtained by innumerable\r\nlabors, by their luxury; for when Chushan, king of the Assyrians, had\r\nmade war against them, they lost many of their soldiers in the battle,\r\nand when they were besieged, they were taken by force; nay, there were\r\nsome who, out of fear, voluntarily submitted to him, and though the\r\ntribute laid upon them was more than they could bear, yet did they pay\r\nit, and underwent all sort of oppression for eight years; after which\r\ntime they were freed from them in the following manner:—\r\n\r\n3. There was one whose name was Othniel, the son of Kenaz, of the tribe\r\nof Judah, an active man and of great courage. He had an admonition from\r\nGod not to overlook the Israelites in such a distress as they were now\r\nin, but to endeavor boldly to gain them their liberty; so when he had\r\nprocured some to assist him in this dangerous undertaking, [and few they\r\nwere, who, either out of shame at their present circumstances, or out of\r\na desire of changing them, could be prevailed on to assist him,] he\r\nfirst of all destroyed that garrison which Chushan had set over them;\r\nbut when it was perceived that he had not failed in his first attempt,\r\nmore of the people came to his assistance; so they joined battle with\r\nthe Assyrians, and drove them entirely before them, and compelled them\r\nto pass over Euphrates. Hereupon Othniel, who had given such proofs of\r\nhis valor, received from the multitude authority to judge the people;\r\nand when he had ruled over them forty years, he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How Our People Served The Moabites Eighteen Years, And Were\r\nThen Delivered From Slavery By One Ehud Who Retained The Dominion Eighty\r\nYears.\r\n\r\n1. When Othniel was dead, the affairs of the Israelites fell again into\r\ndisorder: and while they neither paid to God the honor due to him, nor\r\nwere obedient to the laws, their afflictions increased, till Eglon, king\r\nof the Moabites, did so greatly despise them on account of the disorders\r\nof their political government, that he made war upon them, and overcame\r\nthem in several battles, and made the most courageous to submit, and\r\nentirely subdued their army, and ordered them to pay him tribute. And\r\nwhen he had built him a royal palace at Jericho, 14 he omitted no method\r\nwhereby he might distress them; and indeed he reduced them to poverty\r\nfor eighteen years. But when God had once taken pity of the Israelites,\r\non account of their afflictions, and was moved to compassion by their\r\nsupplications put up to him, he freed them from the hard usage they had\r\nmet with under the Moabites. This liberty he procured for them in the\r\nfollowing manner;—\r\n\r\n2. There was a young man of the tribe of Benjamin, whose name was Ehud,\r\nthe son of Gera, a man of very great courage in bold undertakings, and\r\nof a very strong body, fit for hard labor, but best skilled in using his\r\nleft hand, in which was his whole strength; and he also dwelt at\r\nJericho. Now this man became familiar with Eglon, and that by means of\r\npresents, with which he obtained his favor, and insinuated himself into\r\nhis good opinion; whereby he was also beloved of those that were about\r\nthe king. Now, when on a time he was bringing presents to the king, and\r\nhad two servants with him, he put a dagger on his right thigh secretly,\r\nand went in to him: it was then summer time, and the middle of the day,\r\nwhen the guards were not strictly on their watch, both because of the\r\nheat, and because they were gone to dinner. So the young man, when he\r\nhad offered his presents to the king, who then resided in a small parlor\r\nthat stood conveniently to avoid the heat, fell into discourse with him,\r\nfor they were now alone, the king having bid his servants that attended\r\nhim to go their ways, because he had a mind to talk with Ehud. He was\r\nnow sitting on his throne; and fear seized upon Ehud lest he should miss\r\nhis stroke, and not give him a deadly wound; so he raised himself up,\r\nand said he had a dream to impart to him by the command of God; upon\r\nwhich the king leaped out of his throne for joy of the dream; so Ehud\r\nsmote him to the heart, and leaving his dagger in his body, he went out\r\nand shut the door after him. Now the king's servants were very still, as\r\nsupposing that the king had composed himself to sleep.\r\n\r\n3. Hereupon Ehud informed the people of Jericho privately of what he had\r\ndone, and exhorted them to recover their liberty; who heard him gladly,\r\nand went to their arms, and sent messengers over the country, that\r\nshould sound trumpets of rams' horns; for it was our custom to call the\r\npeople together by them. Now the attendants of Eglon were ignorant of\r\nwhat misfortune had befallen him for a great while; but, towards the\r\nevening, fearing some uncommon accident had happened, they entered into\r\nhis parlor, and when they found him dead, they were in great disorder,\r\nand knew not what to do; and before the guards could be got together,\r\nthe multitude of the Israelites came upon them, so that some of them\r\nwere slain immediately, and some were put to flight, and ran away toward\r\nthe country of Moab, in order to save themselves. Their number was above\r\nten thousand. The Israelites seized upon the ford of Jordan, and pursued\r\nthem, and slew them, and many of them they killed at the ford, nor did\r\none of them escape out of their hands; and by this means it was that the\r\nHebrews freed themselves from slavery under the Moabites. Ehud also was\r\non this account dignified with the government over all the multitude,\r\nand died after he had held the government eighty years 15 He was a man\r\nworthy of commendation, even besides what he deserved for the\r\nforementioned act of his. After him Shamgat, the son of Anath, was\r\nelected for their governor, but died in the first year of his\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How The Canaanites Brought The Israelites Under Slavery For\r\nTwenty Years; After Which They Were Delivered By Barak And Deborah, Who\r\nRuled Over Them For Forty Years.\r\n\r\n1. And now it was that the Israelites, taking no warning by their former\r\nmisfortunes to amend their manners, and neither worshipping God nor\r\nsubmitting to the laws, were brought under slavery by Jabin, the king of\r\nthe Canaanites, and that before they had a short breathing time after\r\nthe slavery under the Moabites; for this Jabin out of Hazor, a city that\r\nwas situate over the Semechonitis, and had in pay three hundred footmen,\r\nand ten thousand horsemen, with fewer than three thousand chariots.\r\nSisera was commander of all his army, and was the principal person in\r\nthe king's favor. He so sorely beat the Israelites when they fought with\r\nhim, that he ordered them to pay tribute.\r\n\r\n2. So they continued to that hardship for twenty years, as not good\r\nenough of themselves to grow wise by their misfortunes. God was willing\r\nalso hereby the more to subdue their obstinacy and ingratitude towards\r\nhimself: so when at length they were become penitent, and were so wise\r\nas to learn that their calamities arose from their contempt of the laws,\r\nthey besought Deborah, a certain prophetess among them, [which name in\r\nthe Hebrew tongue signifies a Bee,] to pray to God to take pity on them,\r\nand not to overlook them, now they were ruined by the Canaanites. So God\r\ngranted them deliverance, and chose them a general, Barak, one that was\r\nof the tribe of Naphtali. Now Barak, in the Hebrew tongue, signifies\r\nLightning.\r\n\r\n3. So Deborah sent for Barak, and bade him choose out ten thousand young\r\nmen to go against the enemy, because God had said that that number was\r\nsufficient, and promised them victory. But when Barak said that he would\r\nnot be the general unless she would also go as a general with him, she\r\nhad indignation at what he said \"Thou, O Barak, deliverest up meanly\r\nthat authority which God hath given thee into the hand of a woman, and I\r\ndo not reject it!\" So they collected ten thousand men, and pitched their\r\ncamp at Mount Tabor, where, at the king's command, Sisera met them, and\r\npitched his camp not far from the enemy; whereupon the Israelites, and\r\nBarak himself, were so affrighted at the multitude of those enemies,\r\nthat they were resolved to march off, had not Deborah retained them, and\r\ncommanded them to fight the enemy that very day, for that they should\r\nconquer them, and God would be their assistance.\r\n\r\n4. So the battle began; and when they were come to a close fight, there\r\ncame down from heaven a great storm, with a vast quantity of rain and\r\nhail, and the wind blew the rain in the face of the Canaanites, and so\r\ndarkened their eyes, that their arrows and slings were of no advantage\r\nto them, nor would the coldness of the air permit the soldiers to make\r\nuse of their swords; while this storm did not so much incommode the\r\nIsraelites, because it came in their backs. They also took such courage,\r\nupon the apprehension that God was assisting them, that they fell upon\r\nthe very midst of their enemies, and slew a great number of them; so\r\nthat some of them fell by the Israelites, some fell by their own horses,\r\nwhich were put into disorder, and not a few were killed by their own\r\nchariots. At last Sisera, as soon as he saw himself beaten, fled away,\r\nand came to a woman whose name was Jael, a Kenite, who received him,\r\nwhen he desired to be concealed; and when he asked for somewhat to\r\ndrink, she gave him sour milk, of which he drank so unmeasurably that he\r\nfell asleep; but when he was asleep, Jael took an iron nail, and with a\r\nhammer drove it through his temples into the floor; and when Barak came\r\na little afterward, she showed Sisera nailed to the ground: and thus was\r\nthis victory gained by a woman, as Deborah had foretold. Barak also\r\nfought with Jabin at Hazor; and when he met with him, he slew him: and\r\nwhen the general was fallen, Barak overthrew the city to the foundation,\r\nand was the commander of the Israelites for forty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How The Midianites And Other Nations Fought Against The\r\nIsraelites And Beat Them, And Afflicted Their Country For Seven Years,\r\nHow They Were Delivered By Gideon, Who Ruled Over The Multitude For\r\nForty Years.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Barak and Deborah were dead, whose deaths happened about the\r\nsame time, afterwards the Midianites called the Amalekites and Arabians\r\nto their assistance, and made war against the Israelites, and were too\r\nhard for those that fought against them; and when they had burnt the\r\nfruits of the earth, they carried off the prey. Now when they had done\r\nthis for three years, the multitude of the Israelites retired to the\r\nmountains, and forsook the plain country. They also made themselves\r\nhollows under ground, and caverns, and preserved therein whatsoever had\r\nescaped their enemies; for the Midianites made expeditions in harvest-\r\ntime, but permitted them to plough the land in winter, that so, when the\r\nothers had taken the pains, they might have fruits for them to carry\r\naway. Indeed, there ensued a famine and a scarcity of food; upon which\r\nthey betook themselves to their supplications to God, and besought him\r\nto save them.\r\n\r\n2. Gideon also, the son of Joash, one of the principal persons of the\r\ntribe of Manasseh, brought his sheaves of corn privately, and thrashed\r\nthem at the wine-press; for he was too fearful of their enemies to\r\nthrash them openly in the thrashing-floor. At this time somewhat\r\nappeared to him in the shape of a young man, and told him that he was a\r\nhappy man, and beloved of God. To which he immediately replied, \"A\r\nmighty indication of God's favor to me, that I am forced to use this\r\nwine-press instead of a thrashing-floor!\" But the appearance exhorted\r\nhim to be of good courage, and to make an attempt for the recovery of\r\ntheir liberty. He answered, that it was impossible for him to recover\r\nit, because the tribe to which he belonged was by no means numerous; and\r\nbecause he was but young himself, and too inconsiderable to think of\r\nsuch great actions. But the other promised him, that God would supply\r\nwhat he was defective in, and would afford the Israelites victory under\r\nhis conduct.\r\n\r\n3. Now, therefore, as Gideon was relating this to some young men, they\r\nbelieved him, and immediately there was an army of ten thousand men got\r\nready for fighting. But God stood by Gideon in his sleep, and told him\r\nthat mankind were too fond of themselves, and were enemies to such as\r\nexcelled in virtue. Now that they might not pass God over, but ascribe\r\nthe victory to him, and might not fancy it obtained by their own power,\r\nbecause they were a great many, and able of themselves to fight their\r\nenemies, but might confess that it was owing to his assistance, he\r\nadvised him to bring his army about noon, in the violence of the heat,\r\nto the river, and to esteem those that bent down on their knees, and so\r\ndrank, to be men of courage; but for all those that drank tumultuously,\r\nthat he should esteem them to do it out of fear, and as in dread of\r\ntheir enemies. And when Gideon had done as God had suggested to him,\r\nthere were found three hundred men that took water with their hands\r\ntumultuously; so God bid him take these men, and attack the enemy.\r\nAccordingly they pitched their camp at the river Jordan, as ready the\r\nnext day to pass over it.\r\n\r\n4. But Gideon was in great fear, for God had told him beforehand that he\r\nshould set upon his enemies in the night-time; but God, being willing to\r\nfree him from his fear, bid him take one of his soldiers, and go near to\r\nthe Midianites' tents, for that he should from that very place have his\r\ncourage raised, and grow bold. So he obeyed, and went and took his\r\nservant Phurah with him; and as he came near to one of the tents, he\r\ndiscovered that those that were in it were awake, and that one of them\r\nwas telling to his fellow soldier a dream of his own, and that so\r\nplainly that Gideon could hear him. The dream was this:—He thought he\r\nsaw a barley-cake, such a one as could hardly be eaten by men, it was so\r\nvile, rolling through the camp, and overthrowing the royal tent, and the\r\ntents of all the soldiers. Now the other soldier explained this vision\r\nto mean the destruction of the army; and told them what his reason was\r\nwhich made him so conjecture, viz. That the seed called barley was all\r\nof it allowed to be of the vilest sort of seed, and that the Israelites\r\nwere known to be the vilest of all the people of Asia, agreeably to the\r\nseed of barley, and that what seemed to look big among the Israelites\r\nwas this Gideon and the army that was with him; \"and since thou sayest\r\nthou didst see the cake overturning our tents, I am afraid lest God hath\r\ngranted the victory over us to Gideon.\"\r\n\r\n5. When Gideon had heard this dream, good hope and courage came upon\r\nhim; and he commanded his soldiers to arm themselves, and told them of\r\nthis vision of their enemies. They also took courage at what was told\r\nthem, and were ready to perform what he should enjoin them. So Gideon\r\ndivided his army into three parts, and brought it out about the fourth\r\nwatch of the night, each part containing a hundred men: they all bare\r\nempty pitchers and lighted lamps in their hands, that their onset might\r\nnot be discovered by their enemies. They had also each of them a ram's\r\nhorn in his right hand, which he used instead of a trumpet. The enemy's\r\ncamp took up a large space of ground, for it happened that they had a\r\ngreat many camels; and as they were divided into different nations, so\r\nthey were all contained in one circle. Now when the Hebrews did as they\r\nwere ordered beforehand, upon their approach to their enemies, and, on\r\nthe signal given, sounded with their rams' horns, and brake their\r\npitchers, and set upon their enemies with their lamps, and a great\r\nshout, and cried, \"Victory to Gideon, by God's assistance,\" a disorder\r\nand a fright seized upon the other men while they were half asleep, for\r\nit was night-time, as God would have it; so that a few of them were\r\nslain by their enemies, but the greatest part by their own soldiers, on\r\naccount of the diversity of their language; and when they were once put\r\ninto disorder, they killed all that they met with, as thinking them to\r\nbe enemies also. Thus there was a great slaughter made. And as the\r\nreport of Gideon's victory came to the Israelites, they took their\r\nweapons and pursued their enemies, and overtook them in a certain valley\r\nencompassed with torrents, a place which these could not get over; so\r\nthey encompassed them, and slew them all, with their kings, Oreb and\r\nZeeb. But the remaining captains led those soldiers that were left,\r\nwhich were about eighteen thousand, and pitched their camp a great way\r\noff the Israelites. However, Gideon did not grudge his pains, but\r\npursued them with all his army, and joining battle with them, cut off\r\nthe whole enemies' army, and took the other leaders, Zeba and Zalmuna,\r\nand made them captives. Now there were slain in this battle of the\r\nMidianites, and of their auxiliaries the Arabians, about a hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand; and the Hebrews took a great prey, gold, and silver,\r\nand garments, and camels, and asses. And when Gideon was come to his own\r\ncountry of Ophrah, he slew the kings of the Midianites.\r\n\r\n6. However, the tribe of Ephraim was so displeased at the good success\r\nof Gideon, that they resolved to make war against him, accusing him\r\nbecause he did not tell them of his expedition against their enemies.\r\nBut Gideon, as a man of temper, and that excelled in every virtue,\r\npleaded, that it was not the result of his own authority or reasoning,\r\nthat made him attack the enemy without them; but that it was the command\r\nof God, and still the victory belonged to them as well as those in the\r\narmy. And by this method of cooling their passions, he brought more\r\nadvantage to the Hebrews, than by the success he had against these\r\nenemies, for he thereby delivered them from a sedition which was arising\r\namong them; yet did this tribe afterwards suffer the punishment of this\r\ntheir injurious treatment of Gideon, of which we will give an account in\r\ndue time.\r\n\r\n7. Hereupon Gideon would have laid down the government, but was over-\r\npersuaded to take it, which he enjoyed forty years, and distributed\r\njustice to them, as the people came to him in their differences; and\r\nwhat he determined was esteemed valid by all. And when he died, he was\r\nburied in his own country of Ophrah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. That The Judges Who Succeeded Gideon Made War With The\r\nAdjoining Nations For A Long Time.\r\n\r\n1. Now Gideon had seventy sons that were legitimate, for he had many\r\nwives; but he had also one that was spurious, by his concubine Drumah,\r\nwhose name was Abimelech, who, after his father's death, retired to\r\nShechem to his mother's relations, for they were of that place: and when\r\nhe had got money of such of them as were eminent for many instances of\r\ninjustice, he came with them to his father's house, and slew all his\r\nbrethren, except Jotham, for he had the good fortune to escape and be\r\npreserved; but Abimelech made the government tyrannical, and constituted\r\nhimself a lord, to do what he pleased, instead of obeying the laws; and\r\nhe acted most rigidly against those that were the patrons of justice.\r\n\r\n2. Now when, on a certain time, there was a public festival at Shechem,\r\nand all the multitude was there gathered together, Jotham his brother,\r\nwhose escape we before related, went up to Mount Gerizzim, which hangs\r\nover the city Shechem, and cried out so as to be heard by the multitude,\r\nwho were attentive to him. He desired they would consider what he was\r\ngoing to say to them: so when silence was made, he said, That when the\r\ntrees had a human voice, and there was an assembly of them gathered\r\ntogether, they desired that the fig-tree would rule over them; but when\r\nthat tree refused so to do, because it was contented to enjoy that honor\r\nwhich belonged peculiarly to the fruit it bare, and not that which\r\nshould be derived to it from abroad, the trees did not leave off their\r\nintentions to have a ruler, so they thought proper to make the offer of\r\nthat honor to the vine; but when the vine was chosen, it made use of the\r\nsame words which the fig-tree had used before, and excused itself from\r\naccepting the government: and when the olive-tree had done the same, the\r\nbrier, whom the trees had desired to take the kingdom, [it is a sort of\r\nwood good for firing,] it promised to take the government, and to be\r\nzealous in the exercise of it; but that then they must sit down under\r\nits shadow, and if they should plot against it to destroy it, the\r\nprinciple of fire that was in it should destroy them. He told them, that\r\nwhat he had said was no laughing matter; for that when they had\r\nexperienced many blessings from Gideon, they overlooked Abimelech, when\r\nhe overruled all, and had joined with him in slaying his brethren; and\r\nthat he was no better than a fire himself. So when he had said this, he\r\nwent away, and lived privately in the mountains for three years, out of\r\nfear of Abimelech.\r\n\r\n3. A little while after this festival, the Shechemites, who had now\r\nrepented themselves of having slain the sons of Gideon, drove Abimelech\r\naway, both from their city and their tribe; whereupon he contrived how\r\nhe might distress their city. Now at the season of vintage, the people\r\nwere afraid to go out and gather their fruits, for fear Abimelech should\r\ndo them some mischief. Now it happened that there had come to them a man\r\nof authority, one Gaal, that sojourned with them, having his armed men\r\nand his kinsmen with him; so the Shechemites desired that he would allow\r\nthem a guard during their vintage; whereupon he accepted of their\r\ndesires, and so the people went out, and Gaal with them at the head of\r\nhis soldiery. So they gathered their fruit with safety; and when they\r\nwere at supper in several companies, they then ventured to curse\r\nAbimelech openly; and the magistrates laid ambushes in places about the\r\ncity, and caught many of Abimelech's followers, and destroyed them.\r\n\r\n4. Now there was one Zebul, a magistrate of the Shechemites, that had\r\nentertained Abimelech. He sent messengers, and informed him how much\r\nGaal had irritated the people against him, and excited him to lay\r\nambushes before the city, for that he would persuade Gaal to go out\r\nagainst him, which would leave it in his power to be revenged on him;\r\nand when that was once done, he would bring him to be reconciled to the\r\ncity. So Abimelech laid ambushes, and himself lay with them. Now Gaal\r\nabode in the suburbs, taking little care of himself; and Zebul was with\r\nhim. Now as Gaal saw the armed men coming on, he said to Zebul, That\r\nsome armed men were coming; but the other replied, They were only\r\nshadows of huge stones: and when they were come nearer, Gaal perceived\r\nwhat was the reality, and said, They were not shadows, but men lying in\r\nambush. Then said Zebul, \"Didst not thou reproach Abimelech for\r\ncowardice? why dost thou not then show how very courageous thou art\r\nthyself, and go and fight him?\" So Gaal, being in disorder, joined\r\nbattle with Abimelech, and some of his men fell; whereupon he fled into\r\nthe city, and took his men with him. But Zebul managed his matters so in\r\nthe city, that he procured them to expel Gaal out of the city, and this\r\nby accusing him of cowardice in this action with the soldiers of\r\nAhimelech. But Abimelech, when he had learned that the Shechemites were\r\nagain coming out to gather their grapes, placed ambushes before the\r\ncity, and when they were coming out, the third part of his army took\r\npossession of the gates, to hinder the citizens from returning in again,\r\nwhile the rest pursued those that were scattered abroad, and so there\r\nwas slaughter every where; and when he had overthrown the city to the\r\nvery foundations, for it was not able to bear a siege, and had sown its\r\nruins with salt, he proceeded on with his army till all the Shechemites\r\nwere slain. As for those that were scattered about the country, and so\r\nescaped the danger, they were gathered together unto a certain strong\r\nrock, and settled themselves upon it, and prepared to build a wall about\r\nit: and when Abimelech knew their intentions, he prevented them, and\r\ncame upon them with his forces, and laid faggots of dry wood round the\r\nplace, he himself bringing some of them, and by his example encouraging\r\nthe soldiers to do the same. And when the rock was encompassed round\r\nabout with these faggots, they set them on fire, and threw in whatsoever\r\nby nature caught fire the most easily: so a mighty flame was raised, and\r\nnobody could fly away from the rock, but every man perished, with their\r\nwives and children, in all about fifteen hundred men, and the rest were\r\na great number also. And such was the calamity which fell upon the\r\nShechemites; and men's grief on their account had been greater than it\r\nwas, had they not brought so much mischief on a person who had so well\r\ndeserved of them, and had they not themselves esteemed this as a\r\npunishment for the same.\r\n\r\n5. Now Abimelech, when he had affrighted the Israelites with the\r\nmiseries he had brought upon the Shechemites, seemed openly to affect\r\ngreater authority than he now had, and appeared to set no bounds to his\r\nviolence, unless it were with the destruction of all. Accordingly he\r\nmarched to Thebes, and took the city on the sudden; and there being a\r\ngreat tower therein, whereunto the whole multitude fled, he made\r\npreparation to besiege it. Now as he was rushing with violence near the\r\ngates, a woman threw a piece of a millstone upon his head, upon which\r\nAbimelech fell down, and desired his armor-bearer to kill him lest his\r\ndeath should be thought to be the work of a woman:—who did what he was\r\nbid to do. So he underwent this death as a punishment for the wickedness\r\nhe had perpetrated against his brethren, and his insolent barbarity to\r\nthe Shechemites. Now the calamity that happened to those Shechemites was\r\naccording to the prediction of Jotham, However, the army that was with\r\nAbimelech, upon his fall, was scattered abroad, and went to their own\r\nhomes.\r\n\r\n6. Now it was that Jair the Gileadite, 16 of the tribe of Manasseh, took\r\nthe government. He was a man happy in other respects also, but\r\nparticularly in his children, who were of a good character. They were\r\nthirty in number, and very skillful in riding on horses, and were\r\nintrusted with the government of the cities of Gilead. He kept the\r\ngovernment twenty-two years, and died an old man; and he was buried in\r\nCamon, a city of Gilead.\r\n\r\n7. And now all the affairs of the Hebrews were managed uncertainly, and\r\ntended to disorder, and to the contempt of God and of the laws. So the\r\nAmmonites and Philistines had them in contempt, and laid waste the\r\ncountry with a great army; and when they had taken all Perea, they were\r\nso insolent as to attempt to gain the possession of all the rest. But\r\nthe Hebrews, being now amended by the calamities they had undergone,\r\nbetook themselves to supplications to God; and brought sacrifices to\r\nhim, beseeching him not to be too severe upon them, but to be moved by\r\ntheir prayers to leave off his anger against them. So God became more\r\nmerciful to them, and was ready to assist them.\r\n\r\n8. When the Ammonites had made an expedition into the land of Gilead,\r\nthe inhabitants of the country met them at a certain mountain, but\r\nwanted a commander. Now there was one whose name was Jephtha, who, both\r\non account of his father's virtue, and on account of that army which he\r\nmaintained at his own expenses, was a potent man: the Israelites\r\ntherefore sent to him, and entreated him to come to their assistance,\r\nand promised him the dominion over them all his lifetime. But he did not\r\nadmit of their entreaty; and accused them, that they did not come to his\r\nassistance when he was unjustly treated, and this in an open manner by\r\nhis brethren; for they cast him off, as not having the same mother with\r\nthe rest, but born of a strange mother, that was introduced among them\r\nby his father's fondness; and this they did out of a contempt of his\r\ninability [to vindicate himself]. So he dwelt in the country of Gilead,\r\nas it is called, and received all that came to him, let them come from\r\nwhat place soever, and paid them wages. However, when they pressed him\r\nto accept the dominion, and sware they would grant him the government\r\nover them all his life, he led them to the war.\r\n\r\n9. And when Jephtha had taken immediate care of their affairs, he placed\r\nhis army at the city Mizpeh, and sent a message to the Ammonite [king],\r\ncomplaining of his unjust possession of their land. But that king sent a\r\ncontrary message; and complained of the exodus of the Israelites out of\r\nEgypt, and desired him to go out of the land of the Amorites, and yield\r\nit up to him, as at first his paternal inheritance. But Jephtha returned\r\nthis answer: That he did not justly complain of his ancestors about the\r\nland of the Amorites, and ought rather to thank them that they left the\r\nland of the Ammonites to them, since Moses could have taken it also; and\r\nthat neither would he recede from that land of their own, which God had\r\nobtained for them, and they had now inhabited [above] three hundred\r\nyears, but would fight with them about it.\r\n\r\n10. And when he had given them this answer, he sent the ambassadors\r\naway. And when he had prayed for victory, and had vowed to perform\r\nsacred offices, and if he came home in safety, to offer in sacrifice\r\nwhat living creature soever should first meet him, 17 he joined battle\r\nwith the enemy, and gained a great victory, and in his pursuit slew the\r\nenemies all along as far as the city of Minnith. He then passed over to\r\nthe land of the Ammonites, and overthrew many of their cities, and took\r\ntheir prey, and freed his own people from that slavery which they had\r\nundergone for eighteen years. But as he came back, he fell into a\r\ncalamity no way correspondent to the great actions he had done; for it\r\nwas his daughter that came to meet him; she was also an only child and a\r\nvirgin: upon this Jephtha heavily lamented the greatness of his\r\naffliction, and blamed his daughter for being so forward in meeting him,\r\nfor he had vowed to sacrifice her to God. However, this action that was\r\nto befall her was not ungrateful to her, since she should die upon\r\noccasion of her father's victory, and the liberty of her fellow\r\ncitizens: she only desired her father to give her leave, for two months,\r\nto bewail her youth with her fellow citizens; and then she agreed, that\r\nat the forementioned time he might do with her according to his vow.\r\nAccordingly, when that time was over, he sacrificed his daughter as a\r\nburnt-offering, offering such an oblation as was neither conformable to\r\nthe law nor acceptable to God, not weighing with himself what opinion\r\nthe hearers would have of such a practice.\r\n\r\n11. Now the tribe of Ephraim fought against him, because he did not take\r\nthem along with him in his expedition against the Ammonites, but because\r\nhe alone had the prey, and the glory of what was done to himself. As to\r\nwhich he said, first, that they were not ignorant how his kindred had\r\nfought against him, and that when they were invited, they did not come\r\nto his assistance, whereas they ought to have come quickly, even before\r\nthey were invited. And in the next place, that they were going to act\r\nunjustly; for while they had not courage enough to fight their enemies,\r\nthey came hastily against their own kindred: and he threatened them\r\nthat, with God's assistance, he would inflict a punishment upon them,\r\nunless they would grow wiser. But when he could not persuade them, he\r\nfought with them with those forces which he sent for out of Gilead, and\r\nhe made a great slaughter among them; and when they were beaten, he\r\npursued them, and seized on the passages of Jordan by a part of his army\r\nwhich he had sent before, and slew about forty-two thousand of them.\r\n\r\n12. So when Jephtha had ruled six years, he died, and was buried in his\r\nown country, Sebee, which is a place in the land of Gilead.\r\n\r\n13. Now when Jephtha was dead, Ibzan took the government, being of the\r\ntribe of Judah, and of the city of Bethlehem. He had sixty children,\r\nthirty of them sons, and the rest daughters; all whom he left alive\r\nbehind him, giving the daughters in marriage to husbands, and taking\r\nwives for his sons. He did nothing in the seven years of his\r\nadministration that was worth recording, or deserved a memorial. So he\r\ndied an old man, and was buried in his own country.\r\n\r\n14. When Ibzan was dead after this manner, neither did Helon, who\r\nsucceeded him in the government, and kept it ten years, do any thing\r\nremarkable: he was of the tribe of Zebulon.\r\n\r\n15. Abdon also, the son of Hilel, of the tribe of Ephraim, and born at\r\nthe city Pyrathon, was ordained their supreme governor after Helon. He\r\nis only recorded to have been happy in his children; for the public\r\naffairs were then so peaceable, and in such security, that neither did\r\nhe perform any glorious action. He had forty sons, and by them left\r\nthirty grandchildren; and he marched in state with these seventy, who\r\nwere all very skillful in riding horses; and he left them all alive\r\nafter him. He died an old man, and obtained a magnificent burial in\r\nPyrathon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. Concerning The Fortitude Of Samson, And What Mischiefs He\r\nBrought Upon The Philistines.\r\n\r\n1. After Abdon was dead, the Philistines overcame the Israelites, and\r\nreceived tribute of them for forty years; from which distress they were\r\ndelivered after this manner:—\r\n\r\n2. There was one Manoah, a person of such great virtue, that he had few\r\nmen his equals, and without dispute the principal person of his country.\r\nHe had a wife celebrated for her beauty, and excelling her\r\ncontemporaries. He had no children; and, being uneasy at his want of\r\nposterity, he entreated God to give them seed of their own bodies to\r\nsucceed them; and with that intent he came constantly into the suburbs\r\n18 together with his wife; which suburbs were in the Great Plain. Now he\r\nwas fond of his wife to a degree of madness, and on that account was\r\nunmeasurably jealous of her. Now, when his wife was once alone, an\r\napparition was seen by her: it was an angel of God, and resembled a\r\nyoung man beautiful and tall, and brought her the good news that she\r\nshould have a son, born by God's providence, that should be a goodly\r\nchild, of great strength; by whom, when he was grown up to man's estate,\r\nthe Philistines should be afflicted. He exhorted her also not to poll\r\nhis hair, and that he should avoid all other kinds of drink, [for so had\r\nGod commanded,] and be entirely contented with water. So the angel, when\r\nhe had delivered that message, went his way, his coming having been by\r\nthe will of God.\r\n\r\n3. Now the wife informed her husband when he came home of what the angel\r\nhad said, who showed so great an admiration of the beauty and tallness\r\nof the young man that had appeared to her, that her husband was\r\nastonished, and out of himself for jealousy, and such suspicions as are\r\nexcited by that passion: but she was desirous of having her husband's\r\nunreasonable sorrow taken away; accordingly she entreated God to send\r\nthe angel again, that he might be seen by her husband. So the angel came\r\nagain by the favor of God, while they were in the suburbs, and appeared\r\nto her when she was alone without her husband. She desired the angel to\r\nstay so long till she might bring her husband; and that request being\r\ngranted, she goes to call Manoah. When he saw the angel he was not yet\r\nfree from suspicion, and he desired him to inform him of all that he had\r\ntold his wife; but when he said it was sufficient that she alone knew\r\nwhat he had said, he then requested of him to tell who he was, that when\r\nthe child was born they might return him thanks, and give him a present.\r\nHe replied that he did not want any present, for that he did not bring\r\nthem the good news of the birth of a son out of the want of any thing.\r\nAnd when Manoah had entreated him to stay, and partake of his\r\nhospitality, he did not give his consent. However he was persuaded, at\r\nthe earnest request of Manoah to stay so long as while he brought him\r\none mark of his hospitality; so he slew a kid of the goats, and bid his\r\nwife boil it. When all was ready, the angel enjoined him to set the\r\nloaves and the flesh, but without the vessels, upon the rock; which when\r\nthey had done, he touched the flesh with the rod which he had in his\r\nhand, which, upon the breaking out of a flame, was consumed, together\r\nwith the loaves; and the angel ascended openly, in their sight, up to\r\nheaven, by means of the smoke, as by a vehicle. Now Manoah was afraid\r\nthat some danger would come to them from this sight of God; but his wife\r\nbade him be of good courage, for that God appeared to them for their\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n4. So the woman proved with child, and was careful to observe the\r\ninjunctions that were given her; and they called the child, when he was\r\nborn, Samson, which name signifies one that is strong. So the child grew\r\napace; and it appeared evidently that he would be a prophet, 19 both by\r\nthe moderation of his diet, and the permission of his hair to grow.\r\n\r\n5. Now when he once came with his parents to Timhath, a city of the\r\nPhilistines, when there was a great festival, he fell in love with a\r\nmaid of that country, and he desired of his parents that they would\r\nprocure him the damsel for his wife: but they refused so to do, because\r\nshe was not of the stock of Israel; yet because this marriage was of\r\nGod, who intended to convert it to the benefit of the Hebrews, he over-\r\npersuaded them to procure her to be espoused to him. And as he was\r\ncontinually coming to her parents, he met a lion, and though he was\r\nnaked, he received his onset, and strangled him with his hands, and cast\r\nthe wild beast into a woody piece of ground on the inside of the road.\r\n\r\n6. And when he was going another time to the damsel, he lit upon a swarm\r\nof bees making their combs in the breast of that lion; and taking three\r\nhoney-combs away, he gave them, together with the rest of his presents,\r\nto the damsel. Now the people of Timhath, out of a dread of the young\r\nman's strength, gave him during the time of the wedding-feast [for he\r\nthen feasted them all] thirty of the most stout of their youth, in\r\npretense to be his companions, but in reality to be a guard upon him,\r\nthat he might not attempt to give them any disturbance. Now as they were\r\ndrinking merrily and playing, Samson said, as was usual at such times,\r\n\"Come, if I propose you a riddle, and you can expound it in these seven\r\ndays' time, I will give you every one a linen shirt and a garment, as\r\nthe reward of your wisdom.\" So they being very ambitious to obtain the\r\nglory of wisdom, together with the gains, desired him to propose his\r\nriddle. He, \"That a devourer produced sweet food out of itself, though\r\nitself were very disagreeable.\" And when they were not able, in three\r\ndays' time, to find out the meaning of the riddle, they desired the\r\ndamsel to discover it by the means of her husband, and tell it them; and\r\nthey threatened to burn her if she did not tell it them. So when the\r\ndamsel entreated Samson to tell it her, he at first refused to do it;\r\nbut when she lay hard at him, and fell into tears, and made his refusal\r\nto tell it a sign of his unkindness to her, he informed her of his\r\nslaughter of a lion, and how he found bees in his breast, and carried\r\naway three honey-combs, and brought them to her. Thus he, suspecting\r\nnothing of deceit, informed her of all, and she revealed it to those\r\nthat desired to know it. Then on the seventh day, whereon they were to\r\nexpound the riddle proposed to them, they met together before sun-\r\nsetting, and said, \"Nothing is more disagreeable than a lion to those\r\nthat light on it, and nothing is sweeter than honey to those that make\r\nuse of it.\" To which Samson made this rejoinder: \"Nothing is more\r\ndeceitful than a woman for such was the person that discovered my\r\ninterpretation to you.\" Accordingly he gave them the presents he had\r\npromised them, making such Askelonites as met him upon the road his\r\nprey, who were themselves Philistines also. But he divorced this his\r\nwife; and the girl despised his anger, and was married to his companion,\r\nwho made the former match between them.\r\n\r\n7. At this injurious treatment Samson was so provoked, that he resolved\r\nto punish all the Philistines, as well as her: so it being then summer-\r\ntime, and the fruits of the land being almost ripe enough for reaping,\r\nhe caught three hundred foxes, and joining lighted torches to their\r\ntails, he sent them into the fields of the Philistines, by which means\r\nthe fruits of the fields perished. Now when the Philistines knew that\r\nthis was Samson's doing, and knew also for what cause he did it, they\r\nsent their rulers to Timhath, and burnt his former wife, and her\r\nrelations, who had been the occasion of their misfortunes.\r\n\r\n8. Now when Samson had slain many of the Philistines in the plain\r\ncountry, he dwelt at Etam, which is a strong rock of the tribe of Judah;\r\nfor the Philistines at that time made an expedition against that tribe:\r\nbut the people of Judah said that they did not act justly with them, in\r\ninflicting punishments upon them while they paid their tribute, and this\r\nonly on account of Samson's offenses. They answered, that in case they\r\nwould not be blamed themselves, they must deliver up Samson, and put him\r\ninto their power. So they being desirous not to be blamed themselves,\r\ncame to the rock with three thousand armed men, and complained to Samson\r\nof the bold insults he had made upon the Philistines, who were men able\r\nto bring calamity upon the whole nation of the Hebrews; and they told\r\nhim they were come to take him, and to deliver him up to them, and put\r\nhim into their power; so they desired him to bear this willingly.\r\nAccordingly, when he had received assurance from them upon oath, that\r\nthey would do him no other harm than only to deliver him into his\r\nenemies' hands, he came down from the rock, and put himself into the\r\npower of his countrymen. Then did they bind him with two cords, and lead\r\nhim on, in order to deliver him to the Philistines; and when they came\r\nto a certain place, which is now called the Jaw-bone, on account of the\r\ngreat action there performed by Samson, though of old it had no\r\nparticular name at all, the Philistines, who had pitched their camp not\r\nfar off, came to meet them with joy and shouting, as having done a great\r\nthing, and gained what they desired; but Samson broke his bonds asunder,\r\nand catching up the jaw-bone of an ass that lay down at his feet, fell\r\nupon his enemies, and smiting them with his jaw-bone, slew a thousand of\r\nthem, and put the rest to flight and into great disorder.\r\n\r\n9. Upon this slaughter Samson was too proud of what he had performed,\r\nand said that this did not come to pass by the assistance of God, but\r\nthat his success was to be ascribed to his own courage; and vaunted\r\nhimself, that it was out of a dread of him that some of his enemies fell\r\nand the rest ran away upon his use of the jaw-bone; but when a great\r\nthirst came upon him, he considered that human courage is nothing, and\r\nbare his testimony that all is to be ascribed to God, and besought him\r\nthat he would not be angry at any thing he had said, nor give him up\r\ninto the hands of his enemies, but afford him help under his affliction,\r\nand deliver him from the misfortune he was under. Accordingly God was\r\nmoved with his entreaties, and raised him up a plentiful fountain of\r\nsweet water at a certain rock whence it was that Samson called the place\r\nthe Jaw-bone, 20 and so it is called to this day.\r\n\r\n10. After this fight Samson held the Philistines in contempt, and came\r\nto Gaza, and took up his lodgings in a certain inn. When the rulers of\r\nGaza were informed of his coming thither, they seized upon the gates,\r\nand placed men in ambush about them, that he might not escape without\r\nbeing perceived; but Samson, who was acquainted with their contrivances\r\nagainst him, arose about midnight, and ran by force upon the gates, with\r\ntheir posts and beams, and the rest of their wooden furniture, and\r\ncarried them away on his shoulders, and bare them to the mountain that\r\nis over Hebron, and there laid them down.\r\n\r\n11. However, he at length 21 transgressed the laws of his country, and\r\naltered his own regular way of living, and imitated the strange customs\r\nof foreigners, which thing was the beginning of his miseries; for he\r\nfell in love with a woman that was a harlot among the Philistines: her\r\nname was Delilah, and he lived with her. So those that administered the\r\npublic affairs of the Philistines came to her, and, with promises,\r\ninduced her to get out of Samson what was the cause of that his\r\nstrength, by which he became unconquerable to his enemies. Accordingly,\r\nwhen they were drinking, and had the like conversation together, she\r\npretended to admire the actions he had done, and contrived to get out of\r\nhim by subtlety, by what means he so much excelled others in strength.\r\nSamson, in order to delude Delilah, for he had not yet lost his senses,\r\nreplied, that if he were bound with seven such green withs of a vine as\r\nmight still be wreathed, he should be weaker than any other man. The\r\nwoman said no more then, but told this to the rulers of the Philistines,\r\nand hid certain of the soldiers in ambush within the house; and when he\r\nwas disordered in drink and asleep, she bound him as fast as possible\r\nwith the withs; and then upon her awakening him, she told him some of\r\nthe people were upon him; but he broke the withs, and endeavored to\r\ndefend himself, as though some of the people were upon him. Now this\r\nwoman, in the constant conversation Samson had with her, pretended that\r\nshe took it very ill that he had such little confidence in her\r\naffections to him, that he would not tell her what she desired, as if\r\nshe would not conceal what she knew it was for his interest to have\r\nconcealed. However, he deluded her again, and told her, that if they\r\nbound him with seven cords, he should lose his strength. And when, upon\r\ndoing this, she gained nothing, he told her the third time, that his\r\nhair should be woven into a web; but when, upon doing this, the truth\r\nwas not yet discovered, at length Samson, upon Delilah's prayer, [for he\r\nwas doomed to fall into some affliction,] was desirous to please her,\r\nand told her that God took care of him, and that he was born by his\r\nprovidence, and that \"thence it is that I suffer my hair to grow, God\r\nhaving charged me never to poll my head, and thence my strength is\r\naccording to the increase and continuance of my hair.\" When she had\r\nlearned thus much, and had deprived him of his hair, she delivered him\r\nup to his enemies, when he was not strong enough to defend himself from\r\ntheir attempts upon him; so they put out his eyes, and bound him, and\r\nhad him led about among them.\r\n\r\n12. But in process of time Samson's hair grew again. And there was a\r\npublic festival among the Philistines, when the rulers, and those of the\r\nmost eminent character, were feasting together; [now the room wherein\r\nthey were had its roof supported by two pillars;] so they sent for\r\nSamson, and he was brought to their feast, that they might insult him in\r\ntheir cups. Hereupon he, thinking it one of the greatest misfortunes, if\r\nhe should not be able to revenge himself when he was thus insulted,\r\npersuaded the boy that led him by the hand, that he was weary and wanted\r\nto rest himself, and desired he would bring him near the pillars; and as\r\nsoon as he came to them, he rushed with force against them, and\r\noverthrew the house, by overthrowing its pillars, with three thousand\r\nmen in it, who were all slain, and Samson with them. And such was the\r\nend of this man, when he had ruled over the Israelites twenty years. And\r\nindeed this man deserves to be admired for his courage and strength, and\r\nmagnanimity at his death, and that his wrath against his enemies went so\r\nfar as to die himself with them. But as for his being ensnared by a\r\nwoman, that is to be ascribed to human nature, which is too weak to\r\nresist the temptations to that sin; but we ought to bear him witness,\r\nthat in all other respects he was one of extraordinary virtue. But his\r\nkindred took away his body, and buried it in Sarasat his own country,\r\nwith the rest of his family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. How Under Eli's Government Of The Israelites Booz Married\r\nRuth, From Whom Came Obed The Grandfather Of David.\r\n\r\n1. Now after the death of Samson, Eli the high priest was governor of\r\nthe Israelites. Under him, when the country was afflicted with a famine,\r\nElimelech of Bethlehem, which is a city of the tribe of Judah, being not\r\nable to support his family under so sore a distress, took with him Naomi\r\nhis wife, and the children that were born to him by her, Chillon and\r\nMahlon, and removed his habitation into the land of Moab; and upon the\r\nhappy prosperity of his affairs there, he took for his sons wives of the\r\nMoabites, Orpah for Chillon, and Ruth for Mahlon. But in the compass of\r\nten years, both Elimelech, and a little while after him, the sons, died;\r\nand Naomi being very uneasy at these accidents, and not being able to\r\nbear her lonesome condition, now those that were dearest to her were\r\ndead, on whose account it was that she had gone away from her own\r\ncountry, she returned to it again, for she had been informed it was now\r\nin a flourishing condition. However, her daughters-in-law were not able\r\nto think of parting with her; and when they had a mind to go out of the\r\ncountry with her, she could not dissuade them from it; but when they\r\ninsisted upon it, she wished them a more happy wedlock than they had\r\nwith her sons, and that they might have prosperity in other respects\r\nalso; and seeing her own affairs were so low, she exhorted them to stay\r\nwhere they were, and not to think of leaving their own country, and\r\npartaking with her of that uncertainty under which she must return.\r\nAccordingly Orpah staid behind; but she took Ruth along with her, as not\r\nto be persuaded to stay behind her, but would take her fortune with her,\r\nwhatsoever it should prove.\r\n\r\n2. When Ruth was come with her mother-in-law to Bethlehem, Booz, who was\r\nnear of kin to Elimelech, entertained her; and when Naomi was so called\r\nby her fellow citizens, according to her true name, she said, \"You might\r\nmore truly call me Mara.\" Now Naomi signifies in the Hebrew tongue\r\nhappiness, and Mara, sorrow. It was now reaping time; and Ruth, by the\r\nleave of her mother-in-law, went out to glean, that they might get a\r\nstock of corn for their food. Now it happened that she came into Booz's\r\nfield; and after some time Booz came thither, and when he saw the\r\ndamsel, he inquired of his servant that was set over the reapers\r\nconcerning the girl. The servant had a little before inquired about all\r\nher circumstances, and told them to his master, who kindly embraced her,\r\nboth on account of her affection to her mother-in-law, and her\r\nremembrance of that son of hers to whom she had been married, and wished\r\nthat she might experience a prosperous condition; so he desired her not\r\nto glean, but to reap what she was able, and gave her leave to carry it\r\nhome. He also gave it in charge to that servant who was over the\r\nreapers, not to hinder her when she took it away, and bade him give her\r\nher dinner, and make her drink when he did the like to the reapers. Now\r\nwhat corn Ruth received of him she kept for her mother-in-law, and came\r\nto her in the evening, and brought the ears of corn with her; and Naomi\r\nhad kept for her a part of such food as her neighbors had plentifully\r\nbestowed upon her. Ruth also told her mother-in-law what Booz had said\r\nto her; and when the other had informed her that he was near of kin to\r\nthem, and perhaps was so pious a man as to make some provision for them,\r\nshe went out again on the days following, to gather the gleanings with\r\nBooz's maidservants.\r\n\r\n3. It was not many days before Booz, after the barley was winnowed,\r\nslept in his thrashing-floor. When Naomi was informed of this\r\ncircumstance she contrived it so that Ruth should lie down by him, for\r\nshe thought it might be for their advantage that he should discourse\r\nwith the girl. Accordingly she sent the damsel to sleep at his feet; who\r\nwent as she bade her, for she did not think it consistent with her duty\r\nto contradict any command of her mother-in-law. And at first she lay\r\nconcealed from Booz, as he was fast asleep; but when he awaked about\r\nmidnight, and perceived a woman lying by him, he asked who she was;—and\r\nwhen she told him her name, and desired that he whom she owned for her\r\nlord would excuse her, he then said no more; but in the morning, before\r\nthe servants began to set about their work, he awaked her, and bid her\r\ntake as much barley as she was able to carry, and go to her mother-in-\r\nlaw before any body there should see that she had lain down by him,\r\nbecause it was but prudent to avoid any reproach that might arise on\r\nthat account, especially when there had been nothing done that was ill.\r\nBut as to the main point she aimed at, the matter should rest here,—\"He\r\nthat is nearer of kin than I am, shall be asked whether he wants to take\r\nthee to wife: if he says he does, thou shalt follow him; but if he\r\nrefuse it, I will marry thee, according to the law.\"\r\n\r\n4. When she had informed her mother-in-law of this, they were very glad\r\nof it, out of the hope they had that Booz would make provision for them.\r\nNow about noon Booz went down into the city, and gathered the senate\r\ntogether, and when he had sent for Ruth, he called for her kinsman also;\r\nand when he was come, he said, \"Dost not thou retain the inheritance of\r\nElimelech and his sons?\" He confessed that he did retain it, and that he\r\ndid as he was permitted to do by the laws, because he was their nearest\r\nkinsman. Then said Booz, \"Thou must not remember the laws by halves, but\r\ndo every thing according to them; for the wife of Mahlon is come hither,\r\nwhom thou must marry, according to the law, in case thou wilt retain\r\ntheir fields.\" So the man yielded up both the field and the wife to\r\nBooz, who was himself of kin to those that were dead, as alleging that\r\nhe had a wife already, and children also; so Booz called the senate to\r\nwitness, and bid the woman to loose his shoe, and spit in his face,\r\naccording to the law; and when this was done, Booz married Ruth, and\r\nthey had a son within a year's time. Naomi was herself a nurse to this\r\nchild; and by the advice of the women, called him Obed, as being to be\r\nbrought up in order to be subservient to her in her old age, for Obed in\r\nthe Hebrew dialect signifies a servant. The son of Obed was Jesse, and\r\nDavid was his son, who was king, and left his dominions to his sons for\r\none and twenty generations. I was therefore obliged to relate this\r\nhistory of Ruth, because I had a mind to demonstrate the power of God,\r\nwho, without difficulty, can raise those that are of ordinary parentage\r\nto dignity and splendor, to which he advanced David, though he were born\r\nof such mean parents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. Concerning The Birth Of Samuel; And How He Foretold The\r\nCalamity That Befell The Sons Of Eli.\r\n\r\n1. And now upon the ill state of the affairs of the Hebrews, they made\r\nwar again upon the Philistines. The occasion was this: Eli, the high\r\npriest, had two sons, Hophni and Phineas. These sons of Eli were guilty\r\nof injustice towards men, and of impiety towards God, and abstained from\r\nno sort of wickedness. Some of their gifts they carried off, as\r\nbelonging to the honorable employment they had; others of them they took\r\naway by violence. They also were guilty of impurity with the women that\r\ncame to worship God at the tabernacle, obliging some to submit to their\r\nlust by force, and enticing others by bribes; nay, the whole course of\r\ntheir lives was no better than tyranny. Their father therefore was angry\r\nat them for such their wickedness, and expected that God would suddenly\r\ninflict his punishments upon them for what they had done. The multitude\r\ntook it heinously also. And as soon as God had foretold what calamity\r\nwould befall Eli's sons, which he did both to Eli himself and to Samuel\r\nthe prophet, who was yet but a child, he openly showed his sorrow for\r\nhis sons' destruction.\r\n\r\n2. I will first despatch what I have to say about the prophet Samuel,\r\nand after that will proceed to speak of the sons of Eli, and the\r\nmiseries they brought on the whole people of the Hebrews. Elcanah, a\r\nLevite, one of a middle condition among his fellow citizens, and one\r\nthat dwelt at Ramathaim, a city of the tribe of Ephraim, married two\r\nwives, Hannah and Peninnah. He had children by the latter; but he loved\r\nthe other best, although she was barren. Now Elcanah came with his wives\r\nto the city Shiloh to sacrifice, for there it was that the tabernacle of\r\nGod was fixed, as we have formerly said. Now when, after he had\r\nsacrificed, he distributed at that festival portions of the flesh to his\r\nwives and children, and when Hannah saw the other wife's children\r\nsitting round about their mother, she fell into tears, and lamented\r\nherself on account of her barrenness and lonesomeness; and suffering her\r\ngrief to prevail over her husband's consolations to her, she went to the\r\ntabernacle to beseech God to give her seed, and to make her a mother;\r\nand to vow to consecrate the first son she should bear to the service of\r\nGod, and this in such a way, that his manner of living should not be\r\nlike that of ordinary men. And as she continued at her prayers a long\r\ntime, Eli, the high priest, for he sat there before the tabernacle, bid\r\nher go away, thinking she had been disordered with wine; but when she\r\nsaid she had drank water, but was in sorrow for want of children, and\r\nwas beseeching God for them, he bid her be of good cheer, and told her\r\nthat God would send her children.\r\n\r\n3. So she came to her husband full of hope, and ate her meal with\r\ngladness. And when they had returned to their own country she found\r\nherself with child, and they had a son born to them, to whom they gave\r\nthe name of Samuel, which may be styled one that was asked of God. They\r\ntherefore came to the tabernacle to offer sacrifice for the birth of the\r\nchild, and brought their tithes with them; but the woman remembered the\r\nvows she had made concerning her son, and delivered him to Eli,\r\ndedicating him to God, that he might become a prophet. Accordingly his\r\nhair was suffered to grow long, and his drink was water. So Samuel dwelt\r\nand was brought up in the temple. But Elcanah had other sons by Hannah,\r\nand three daughters.\r\n\r\n4. Now when Samuel was twelve years old, he began to prophesy: and once\r\nwhen he was asleep, God called to him by his name; and he, supposing he\r\nhad been called by the high priest, came to him: but when the high\r\npriest said he did not call him, God did so thrice. Eli was then so far\r\nilluminated, that he said to him, \"Indeed, Samuel, I was silent now as\r\nwell as before: it is God that calls thee; do thou therefore signify it\r\nto him, and say, I am here ready.\" So when he heard God speak again, he\r\ndesired him to speak, and to deliver what oracles he pleased to him, for\r\nhe would not fail to perform any ministration whatsoever he should make\r\nuse of him in;—to which God replied, \"Since thou art here ready, learn\r\nwhat miseries are coming upon the Israelites,—such indeed as words\r\ncannot declare, nor faith believe; for the sons of Eli shall die on one\r\nday, and the priesthood shall be transferred into the family of Eleazar;\r\nfor Eli hath loved his sons more than he hath loved my worship, and to\r\nsuch a degree as is not for their advantage.\" Which message Eli obliged\r\nthe prophet by oath to tell him, for otherwise he had no inclination to\r\nafflict him by telling it. And now Eli had a far more sure expectation\r\nof the perdition of his sons; but the glory of Samuel increased more and\r\nmore, it being found by experience that whatsoever he prophesied came to\r\npass accordingly. 22\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. Herein Is Declared What Befell The Sons Of Eli, The Ark, And\r\nThe People And How Eli Himself Died Miserably.\r\n\r\n1. About this time it was that the Philistines made war against the\r\nIsraelites, and pitched their camp at the city Aphek. Now when the\r\nIsraelites had expected them a little while, the very next day they\r\njoined battle, and the Philistines were conquerors, and slew above four\r\nthousand of the Hebrews, and pursued the rest of their multitude to\r\ntheir camp.\r\n\r\n2. So the Hebrews being afraid of the worst, sent to the senate, and to\r\nthe high priest, and desired that they would bring the ark of God, that\r\nby putting themselves in array, when it was present with them, they\r\nmight be too hard for their enemies, as not reflecting that he who had\r\ncondemned them to endure these calamities was greater than the ark, and\r\nfor whose sake it was that this ark came to be honored. So the ark came,\r\nand the sons of the high priest with it, having received a charge from\r\ntheir father, that if they pretended to survive the taking of the ark,\r\nthey should come no more into his presence, for Phineas officiated\r\nalready as high priest, his father having resigned his office to him, by\r\nreason of his great age. So the Hebrews were full of courage, as\r\nsupposing that, by the coming of the ark, they should be too hard for\r\ntheir enemies: their enemies also were greatly concerned, and were\r\nafraid of the ark's coming to the Israelites: however, the upshot did\r\nnot prove agreeable to the expectation of both sides, but when the\r\nbattle was joined, that victory which the Hebrews expected was gained by\r\nthe Philistines, and that defeat the Philistines were afraid of fell to\r\nthe lot of the Israelites, and thereby they found that they had put\r\ntheir trust in the ark in vain, for they were presently beaten as soon\r\nas they came to a close fight with their enemies, and lost about thirty\r\nthousand men, among whom were the sons of the high priest; but the ark\r\nwas carried away by the enemies.\r\n\r\n3. When the news of this defeat came to Shiloh, with that of the\r\ncaptivity of the ark, [for a certain young man, a Benjamite, who was in\r\nthe action, came as a messenger thither,] the whole city was full of\r\nlamentations. And Eli, the high priest, who sat upon a high throne at\r\none of the gates, heard their mournful cries, and supposed that some\r\nstrange thing had befallen his family. So he sent for the young man; and\r\nwhen he understood what had happened in the battle, he was not much\r\nuneasy as to his sons, or what was told him withal about the army, as\r\nhaving beforehand known by Divine revelation that those things would\r\nhappen, and having himself declared them beforehand,—for what sad things\r\ncome unexpectedly they distress men the most; but as soon as [he heard]\r\nthe ark was carried captive by their enemies, he was very much grieved\r\nat it, because it fell out quite differently from what he expected; so\r\nhe fell down from his throne and died, having in all lived ninety-eight\r\nyears, and of them retained the government forty.\r\n\r\n4. On the same day his son Phineas's wife died also, as not able to\r\nsurvive the misfortune of her husband; for they told her of her\r\nhusband's death as she was in labor. However, she bare a son at seven\r\nmonths, who lived, and to whom they gave the name of Icabod, which name\r\nsignifies disgrace,—and this because the army received a disgrace at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n5. Now Eli was the first of the family of Ithamar, the other son of\r\nAaron, that had the government; for the family of Eleazar officiated as\r\nhigh priest at first, the son still receiving that honor from the father\r\nwhich Eleazar bequeathed to his son Phineas; after whom Abiezer his son\r\ntook the honor, and delivered it to his son, whose name was Bukki, from\r\nwhom his son Ozi received it; after whom Eli, of whom we have been\r\nspeaking, had the priesthood, and so he and his posterity until the time\r\nof Solomon's reign; but then the posterity of Eleazar reassumed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ The Amorites were one of the seven nations of Canaan. Hence\r\nReland is willing to suppose that Josephus did not here mean that their\r\nland beyond Jordan was a seventh part of the whole land of Canaan, but\r\nmeant the Arnorites as a seventh nation. His reason is, that Josephus,\r\nas well as our Bible, generally distinguish the land beyond Jordan from\r\nthe land of Canaan; nor can it be denied, that in strictness they were\r\nall forgot: yet after two tribes and a half of the twelve tribes came to\r\ninherit it, it might in a general way altogether be well included under\r\nthe land of Canaan, or Palestine, or Judea, of which we have a clear\r\nexample here before us in Josephus, whose words evidently imply, that\r\ntaking the whole land of Canaan, or that inhabited by all the twelve\r\ntribes together, and parting it into seven parts, the part beyond Jordan\r\nwas in quantity of ground one seventh part of the whole. And this well\r\nenough agrees to Reland's own map of that country, although this land\r\nbeyond Jordan was so peculiarly fruitful, and good for pasturage, as the\r\ntwo tribes and a half took notice, Numbers 32:1, 4, 16, that it\r\nmaintained about a fifth part of the whole people.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ It plainly appears by the history of these spies, and the\r\ninnkeeper Rahab's deception of the king of Jericho's messengers, by\r\ntelling them what was false in order to save the lives of the spies, and\r\nyet the great commendation of her faith and good works in the New\r\nTestament, Hebrews 11:31; James 2:25, as well as by many other parallel\r\nexamples, both in the Old Testament and in Josephus, that the best men\r\ndid not then scruple to deceive those public enemies who might justly be\r\ndestroyed; as also might deceive ill men in order to save life, and\r\ndeliver themselves from the tyranny of their unjust oppressors, and this\r\nby telling direct falsehoods; I mean, all this where no oath was\r\ndemanded of them, otherwise they never durst venture on such a\r\nprocedure. Nor was Josephus himself of any other opinion or practice, as\r\nI shall remark in the note on Antiq. B. IX. ch. 4. sect. 3. And observe,\r\nthat I still call this woman Rahab, an innkeeper, not a harlot, the\r\nwhole history, both in our copies, and especially in Josephus, implying\r\nno more. It was indeed so frequent a thing, that women who were\r\ninnkeepers were also harlots, or maintainers of harlots, that the word\r\ncommonly used for real harlots was usually given them.

V. ch. 7. sect. 8.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ Upon occasion of this devoting of Jericho to destruction,\r\nand the exemplary punishment of Achar, who broke that duerein or\r\nanathema, and of the punishment of the future breaker of it, Hiel, 1\r\nKings 16:34, as also of the punishment of Saul, for breaking the like\r\nchefera or anathema, against the Amalekites, 1 Samuel 15., we may\r\nobserve what was the true meaning of that law, Leviticus 27:28: \"None\r\ndevoted which shall be devoted of shall be redeemed; but shall be put to\r\ndeath;\" i.e. whenever any of the Jews' public enemies had been, for\r\ntheir wickedness, solemnly devoted to destruction, according to the\r\nDivine command, as were generally the seven wicked nations of Canaan,\r\nand those sinners the Amalekites, 1 Samuel 15:18, it was utterly\r\nunlawful to permit those enemies to be redeemed; but they were to be all\r\nutterly destroyed. See also Numbers 23:2, 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ That the name of this chief was not Achan, as in the common\r\ncopies, but Achar, as here in Josephus, and in the Apostolical Constit.\r\nB. VII. ch. 2., and elsewhere, is evident by the allusion to that name\r\nin the curse of Joshua, \"Why hast thou troubled us?—the Lord shall\r\ntrouble thee;\" where the Hebrew word alludes only to the name Achar, but\r\nnot to Achan. Accordingly, this Valley of Achar, or Achor, was and is a\r\nknown place, a little north of Gilgal, so called from the days of Joshua\r\ntill this day. See Joshua 7:26; Isaiah 65:10; Hosea 2:15; and Dr.\r\nBernard's notes here.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 (return) [ Here Dr. Bernard very justly observes, that a few words are\r\ndropped out of Josephus's copies, on account of the repetition of the\r\nword shekels, and that it ought to be read thus:—\"A piece of gold that\r\nweighed fifty shekels, and one of silver that weighed two hundred\r\nshekels,\" as in our other copies, Joshua 7:21.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 (return) [ I agree here with Dr. Bernard, and approve of Josephus's\r\ninterpretation of Gilgal for liberty.

In the mean time, the fact itself was mentioned in\r\nthe book of Jasher, now lost, Joshua 10:13, and is confirmed by Isaiah,\r\n28:21, Habakkuk, 3:11, and by the son of Sirach, Ecclus. 46:4. In the\r\n18th Psalm of Solomon, yet it is also said of the luminaries, with\r\nrelation, no doubt, to this and the other miraculous standing still and\r\ngoing back, in the days of Joshua and Hezekiah, \"They have not wandered,\r\nfrom the day that he created them; they have not forsaken their way,\r\nfrom ancient generations, unless it were when God enjoined them [so to\r\ndo] by the command of his servants.\" See Authent.

Nor is it unworthy of our notice what Moses Chorenensis adds, p.\r\n53, and this upon a diligent examination, viz. that \"one of those\r\neminent men among the Canaanites came at the same time into Armenia, and\r\nfounded the Genthuniaa family, or tribe; and that this was confirmed by\r\nthe manners of the same family or tribe, as being like those of the\r\nCanaanites.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n10 (return) [ By prophesying, when spoken of a high priest, Josephus,\r\nboth here and frequently elsewhere, means no more than consulting God by\r\nUrim, which the reader is still to bear in mind upon all occasions. And\r\nif St. John, who was contemporary with Josephus, and of the same\r\ncountry, made use of this style, when he says that \"Caiaphas being high\r\npriest that year, prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation, and\r\nnot for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one\r\nthe children of God that were scattered abroad,\" chap. 11;51, 52, he may\r\npossibly mean, that this was revealed to the high priest by an\r\nextraordinary voice from between the cherubims, when he had his\r\nbreastplate, or Urim and Thummim, on before; or the most holy place of\r\nthe temple, which was no other than the oracle of Urim and Thummim.

VIII. ch. 14. sect. 1, intimate to us what was the ancient\r\nform of government among several nations before the monarchies began,\r\nviz. that every city or large town, with its neighboring villages, was a\r\ndistinct government by itself; which is the more remarkable, because\r\nthis was certainly the form of ecclesiastical government that was\r\nsettled by the apostles, and preserved throughout the Christian church\r\nin the first ages of Christianity. Mr. Addison is of opinion, that \"it\r\nwould certainly be for the good of mankind to have all the mighty\r\nempires and monarchies of the world cantoned out into petty states and\r\nprincipalities, which, like so many large families, might lie under the\r\nobservation of their proper governors, so that the care of the prince\r\nmight extend itself to every individual person under his protection;\r\nthough he despairs of such a scheme being brought about, and thinks that\r\nif it were, it would quickly be destroyed.\" Remarks on Italy, 4to, p.\r\n151.

See Moses Chorehensis, p.\r\n55. And that Almighty God does not approve of such absolute and\r\ntyrannical monarchies, any one may learn that reads Deuteronomy 17:14-\r\n20, and 1 Samuel 8:1-22; although, if such kings are set up as own him\r\nfor their supreme King, and aim to govern according to his laws, he hath\r\nadmitted of them, and protected them and their subjects in all\r\ngenerations.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12 (return) [ Josephus's early date of this history before the beginning\r\nof the Judges, or when there was no king in Israel, Judges 19;1, is\r\nstrongly confirmed by the large number of Benjamites, both in the days\r\nof Asa and Jehoshaphat, 2 Chronicles 14:8, and 16:17, who yet were here\r\nreduced to six hundred men; nor can those numbers be at all supposed\r\ngenuine, if they were reduced so late as the end of the Judges, where\r\nour other copies place this reduction.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13 (return) [ Josephus seems here to have made a small mistake, when he\r\ntook the Hebrew word Bethel, which denotes the house of God, or the\r\ntabernacle, Judges 20:18, for the proper name of a place, Bethel, it no\r\nway appearing that the tabernacle was ever at Bethel; only so far it is\r\ntrue, that Shiloh, the place of the tabernacle in the days of the\r\nJudges, was not far from Bethel.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14 (return) [ It appears by the sacred history, Judges 1:16; 3:13, that\r\nEglon's pavilion or palace was at the City of Palm-Trees, as the place\r\nwhere Jericho had stood is called after its destruction by Joshua, that\r\nis, at or near the demolished city. Accordingly, Josephus says it was at\r\nJericho, or rather in that fine country of palm-trees, upon, or near to,\r\nthe same spot of ground on which Jericho had formerly stood, and on\r\nwhich it was rebuilt by Hiel, 1 Kings 16:31.

And since in the beginning of the next chapter it is\r\nsaid by Josephus, that there was hardly a breathing time for the\r\nIsraelites before Jabin came and enslaved them, it is highly probable\r\nthat some of the copies in his time had here only eight years instead of\r\neighty; as had that of Theophilus of Antioch, Ad Autolye. 1. iii., and\r\nthis most probably from his copy of Josephus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 (return) [ Our present copies of Josephus all omit Tola among the\r\njudges, though the other copies have him next after Abimelech, and allot\r\ntwenty-three years to his administration, Judges 10:1, 2; yet do all\r\nJosephus's commentators conclude, that in Josephus's sum of the years of\r\nthe judges, his twenty-three years are included; hence we are to\r\nconfess, that somewhat has been here lost out of his copies.]\r\n\r\n\r\n17 (return) [ Josephus justly condemns Jephtha, as do the Apostolical\r\nConstitutions, B.

Containing The Interval Of Thirty-Two Years.—From The Death Of\r\nEli To The Death Of Saul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. The Destruction That Came Upon The Philistines, And Upon\r\nTheir Land, By The Wrath Of Go On Account Of Their Having Carried The\r\nArk Away Captive; And After What Manner They Sent It Back To The\r\nHebrews.\r\n\r\n1. When the Philistines had taken the ark of the Hebrews captive, as I\r\nsaid a little before, they carried it to the city of Ashdod, and put it\r\nby their own god, who was called Dagon, 1 as one of their spoils; but\r\nwhen they went into his temple the next morning to worship their god,\r\nthey found him paying the same worship to the ark, for he lay along, as\r\nhaving fallen down from the basis whereon he had stood: so they took him\r\nup, and set him on his basis again, and were much troubled at what had\r\nhappened; and as they frequently came to Dagon and found him still lying\r\nalong, in a posture of adoration to the ark, they were in very great\r\ndistress and confusion. At length God sent a very destructive disease\r\nupon the city and country of Ashdod, for they died of the dysentery or\r\nflux, a sore distemper, that brought death upon them very suddenly; for\r\nbefore the soul could, as usual in easy deaths, be well loosed from the\r\nbody, they brought up their entrails, and vomited up what they had\r\neaten, and what was entirely corrupted by the disease. And as to the\r\nfruits of their country, a great multitude of mice arose out of the\r\nearth and hurt them, and spared neither the plants nor the fruits. Now\r\nwhile the people of Ashdod were under these misfortunes, and were not\r\nable to support themselves under their calamities, they perceived that\r\nthey suffered thus because of the ark, and that the victory they had\r\ngotten, and their having taken the ark captive, had not happened for\r\ntheir good; they therefore sent to the people of Askelon, and desired\r\nthat they would receive the ark among them. This desire of the people of\r\nAshdod was not disagreeable to those of Askelon, so they granted them\r\nthat favor. But when they had gotten the ark, they were in the same\r\nmiserable condition; for the ark carried along with it the disasters\r\nthat the people of Ashdod had suffered, to those who received it from\r\nthem. Those of Askelon also sent it away from themselves to others: nor\r\ndid it stay among those others neither; for since they were pursued by\r\nthe same disasters, they still sent it to the neighboring cities; so\r\nthat the ark went round, after this manner, to the five cities of the\r\nPhilistines, as though it exacted these disasters as a tribute to be\r\npaid it for its coming among them.\r\n\r\n2. When those that had experienced these miseries were tired out with\r\nthem, and when those that heard of them were taught thereby not to admit\r\nthe ark among them, since they paid so dear a tribute for it, at length\r\nthey sought for some contrivance and method how they might get free from\r\nit: so the governors of the five cities, Gath, and Ekron, and Askelon,\r\nas also of Gaza, and Ashdod, met together, and considered what was fit\r\nto be done; and at first they thought proper to send the ark back to its\r\nown people, as allowing that God had avenged its cause; that the\r\nmiseries they had undergone came along with it, and that these were sent\r\non their cities upon its account, and together with it. However, there\r\nwere those that said they should not do so, nor suffer themselves to be\r\ndeluded, as ascribing the cause of their miseries to it, because it\r\ncould not have such power and force upon them; for, had God had such a\r\nregard to it, it would not have been delivered into the hands of men. So\r\nthey exhorted them to be quiet, and to take patiently what had befallen\r\nthem, and to suppose there was no other cause of it but nature, which,\r\nat certain revolutions of time, produces such mutations in the bodies of\r\nmen, in the earth, in plants, and in all things that grow out of the\r\nearth. But the counsel that prevailed over those already described, was\r\nthat of certain men, who were believed to have distinguished themselves\r\nin former times for their understanding and prudence, and who, in their\r\npresent circumstances, seemed above all the rest to speak properly.\r\nThese men said it was not right either to send the ark away, or to\r\nretain it, but to dedicate five golden images, one for every city, as a\r\nthank-offering to God, on account of his having taken care of their\r\npreservation, and having kept them alive when their lives were likely to\r\nbe taken away by such distempers as they were not able to bear up\r\nagainst. They also would have them make five golden mice like to those\r\nthat devoured and destroyed their country 2 to put them in a bag, and\r\nlay them upon the ark; to make them a new cart also for it, and to yoke\r\nmilch kine to it 3 but to shut up their calves, and keep them from them,\r\nlest, by following after them, they should prove a hinderance to their\r\ndams, and that the dams might return the faster out of a desire of those\r\ncalves; then to drive these milch kine that carried the ark, and leave\r\nit at a place where three ways met, and So leave it to the kine to go\r\nalong which of those ways they pleased; that in case they went the way\r\nto the Hebrews, and ascended to their country, they should suppose that\r\nthe ark was the cause of their misfortunes; but if they turned into\r\nanother road, they said, \"We will pursue after it, and conclude that it\r\nhas no such force in it.\"\r\n\r\n3. So they determined that these men spake well; and they immediately\r\nconfirmed their opinion by doing accordingly. And when they had done as\r\nhas been already described, they brought the cart to a place where three\r\nways met, and left it there and went their ways; but the kine went the\r\nright way, and as if some persons had driven them, while the rulers of\r\nthe Philistines followed after them, as desirous to know where they\r\nwould stand still, and to whom they would go. Now there was a certain\r\nvillage of the tribe of Judah, the name of which was Bethshemesh, and to\r\nthat village did the kine go; and though there was a great and good\r\nplain before them to proceed in, they went no farther, but stopped the\r\ncart there. This was a sight to those of that village, and they were\r\nvery glad; for it being then summer-time, and all the inhabitants being\r\nthen in the fields gathering in their fruits, they left off the labors\r\nof their hands for joy, as soon as they saw the ark, and ran to the\r\ncart, and taking the ark down, and the vessel that had the images in it,\r\nand the mice, they set them upon a certain rock which was in the plain;\r\nand when they had offered a splendid sacrifice to God, and feasted, they\r\noffered the cart and the kine as a burnt-offering: and when the lords of\r\nthe Philistines saw this, they returned back.\r\n\r\n4. But now it was that the wrath of God overtook them, and struck\r\nseventy persons of the village of Bethshemesh dead, who, not being\r\npriests, and so not worthy to touch the ark, had approached to it. 4\r\nThose of that village wept for these that had thus suffered, and made\r\nsuch a lamentation as was naturally to be expected on so great a\r\nmisfortune that was sent from God; and every one mourned for his own\r\nrelation. And since they acknowledged themselves unworthy of the ark's\r\nabode with them, they sent to the public senate of the Israelites, and\r\ninformed them that the ark was restored by the Philistines; which when\r\nthey knew, they brought it away to Kirjathjearim, a city in the\r\nneighborhood of Bethshemesh. In this city lived one Abinadab, by birth a\r\nLevite, and who was greatly commended for his righteous and religious\r\ncourse of life; so they brought the ark to his house, as to a place fit\r\nfor God himself to abide in, since therein did inhabit a righteous man.\r\nHis sons also ministered to the Divine service at the ark, and were the\r\nprincipal curators of it for twenty years; for so many years it\r\ncontinued in Kirjathjearim, having been but four months with the\r\nPhilistines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. The Expedition Of The Philistines Against The Hebrews And The\r\nHebrews' Victory Under The Conduct Of Samuel The Prophet, Who Was Their\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\n1. Now while the city of Kirjathjearim had the ark with them, the whole\r\nbody of the people betook themselves all that time to offer prayers and\r\nsacrifices to God, and appeared greatly concerned and zealous about his\r\nworship. So Samuel the prophet, seeing how ready they were to do their\r\nduty, thought this a proper time to speak to them, while they were in\r\nthis good disposition, about the recovery of their liberty, and of the\r\nblessings that accompanied the same. Accordingly he used such words to\r\nthem as he thought were most likely to excite that inclination, and to\r\npersuade them to attempt it: \"O you Israelites,\" said he, \"to whom the\r\nPhilistines are still grievous enemies, but to whom God begins to be\r\ngracious, it behooves you not only to be desirous of liberty, but to\r\ntake the proper methods to obtain it. Nor are you to be contented with\r\nan inclination to get clear of your lords and masters, while you still\r\ndo what will procure your continuance under them. Be righteous then, and\r\ncast wickedness out of your souls, and by your worship supplicate the\r\nDivine Majesty with all your hearts, and persevere in the honor you pay\r\nto him; for if you act thus, you will enjoy prosperity; you will be\r\nfreed from your slavery, and will get the victory over your enemies:\r\nwhich blessings it is not possible you should attain, either by weapons\r\nof war, or by the strength of your bodies, or by the multitude of your\r\nassistants; for God has not promised to grant these blessings by those\r\nmeans, but by being good and righteous men; and if you will be such, I\r\nwill be security to you for the performance of God's promises.\" When\r\nSamuel had said thus, the multitude applauded his discourse, and were\r\npleased with his exhortation to them, and gave their consent to resign\r\nthemselves up to do what was pleasing to God. So Samuel gathered them\r\ntogether to a certain city called Mizpeh, which, in the Hebrew tongue,\r\nsignifies a watch-tower; there they drew water, and poured it out to\r\nGod, and fasted all day, and betook themselves to their prayers.\r\n\r\n2. This their assembly did not escape the notice of the Philistines: so\r\nwhen they had learned that so large a company had met together, they\r\nfell upon the Hebrews with a great army and mighty forces, as hoping to\r\nassault them when they did not expect it, nor were prepared for it. This\r\nthing affrighted the Hebrews, and put them into disorder and terror; so\r\nthey came running to Samuel, and said that their souls were sunk by\r\ntheir fears, and by the former defeat they had received, and \"that\r\nthence it was that we lay still, lest we should excite the power of our\r\nenemies against us. Now while thou hast brought us hither to offer up\r\nour prayers and sacrifices, and take oaths [to be obedient], our enemies\r\nare making an expedition against us, while we are naked and unarmed;\r\nwherefore we have no other hope of deliverance but that by thy means,\r\nand by the assistance God shall afford us upon thy prayers to him, we\r\nshall obtain deliverance from the Philistines.\" Hereupon Samuel bade\r\nthem be of good cheer, and promised them that God would assist them; and\r\ntaking a sucking lamb, he sacrificed it for the multitude, and besought\r\nGod to hold his protecting hand over them when they should fight with\r\nthe Philistines, and not to overlook them, nor suffer them to come under\r\na second misfortune. Accordingly God hearkened to his prayers, and\r\naccepting their sacrifice with a gracious intention, and such as was\r\ndisposed to assist them, he granted them victory and power over their\r\nenemies. Now while the altar had the sacrifice of God upon it, and had\r\nnot yet consumed it wholly by its sacred fire, the enemy's army marched\r\nout of their camp, and was put in order of battle, and this in hope that\r\nthey should be conquerors, since the Jews 5 were caught in distressed\r\ncircumstances, as neither having their weapons with them, nor being\r\nassembled there in order to fight. But things so fell out, that they\r\nwould hardly have been credited though they had been foretold by\r\nanybody: for, in the first place, God disturbed their enemies with an\r\nearthquake, and moved the ground under them to such a degree, that he\r\ncaused it to tremble, and made them to shake, insomuch that by its\r\ntrembling, he made some unable to keep their feet, and made them fall\r\ndown, and by opening its chasms, he caused that others should be hurried\r\ndown into them; after which he caused such a noise of thunder to come\r\namong them, and made fiery lightning shine so terribly round about them,\r\nthat it was ready to burn their faces; and he so suddenly shook their\r\nweapons out of their hands, that he made them fly and return home naked.\r\nSo Samuel with the multitude pursued them to Bethcar, a place so called;\r\nand there he set up a stone as a boundary of their victory and their\r\nenemies' flight, and called it the Stone of Power, as a signal of that\r\npower God had given them against their enemies.\r\n\r\n3. So the Philistines, after this stroke, made no more expeditions\r\nagainst the Israelites, but lay still out of fear, and out of\r\nremembrance of what had befallen them; and what courage the Philistines\r\nhad formerly against the Hebrews, that, after this victory, was\r\ntransferred to the Hebrews. Samuel also made an expedition against the\r\nPhilistines, and slew many of them, and entirely humbled their proud\r\nhearts, and took from them that country, which, when they were formerly\r\nconquerors in battle, they had cut off from the Jews, which was the\r\ncountry that extended from the borders of Gath to the city of Ekron: but\r\nthe remains of the Canaanites were at this time in friendship with the\r\nIsraelites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How Samuel When He Was So Infirm With Old Age That He Could\r\nNot Take Care Of The Public Affairs Intrusted Them To His Sons; And How\r\nUpon The Evil Administration Of The Government By Them The Multitude\r\nWere So Angry, That They Required To Have A King To Govern Them,\r\nAlthough Samuel Was Much Displeased Thereat.\r\n\r\n1. But Samuel the prophet, when he had ordered the affairs of the people\r\nafter a convenient manner, and had appointed a city for every district\r\nof them, he commanded them to come to such cities, to have the\r\ncontroversies that they had one with another determined in them, he\r\nhimself going over those cities twice in a year, and doing them justice;\r\nand by that means he kept them in very good order for a long time.\r\n\r\n2. But afterwards he found himself oppressed with old age, and not able\r\nto do what he used to do, so he committed the government and the care of\r\nthe multitude to his sons,—the elder of whom was called Joel, and the\r\nname of the younger was Abiah. He also enjoined them to reside and judge\r\nthe people, the one at the city of Bethel, and the other at Beersheba,\r\nand divided the people into districts that should be under the\r\njurisdiction of each of them. Now these men afford us an evident example\r\nand demonstration how some children are not of the like dispositions\r\nwith their parents; but sometimes perhaps good and moderate, though born\r\nof wicked parents; and sometimes showing themselves to be wicked, though\r\nborn of good parents: for these men turning aside from their father's\r\ngood courses, and taking a course that was contrary to them, perverted\r\njustice for the 'filthy lucre of gifts and bribes, and made their\r\ndeterminations not according to truth, but according to bribery, and\r\nturned aside to luxury, and a costly way of living; so that as, in the\r\nfirst place, they practiced what was contrary to the will of God, so did\r\nthey, in the second place, what was contrary to the will of the prophet\r\ntheir father, who had taken a great deal of care, and made a very\r\ncareful provision that the multitude should be righteous.\r\n\r\n3. But the people, upon these injuries offered to their former\r\nconstitution and government by the prophet's sons, were very uneasy at\r\ntheir actions, and came running to the prophet, who then lived at the\r\ncity Ramah, and informed him of the transgressions of his sons; and\r\nsaid, That as he was himself old already, and too infirm by that age of\r\nhis to oversee their affairs in the manner he used to do, so they begged\r\nof him, and entreated him, to appoint some person to be king over them,\r\nwho might rule over the nation, and avenge them of the Philistines, who\r\nought to be punished for their former oppressions. These words greatly\r\nafflicted Samuel, on account of his innate love of justice, and his\r\nhatred to kingly government, for he was very fond of an aristocracy, as\r\nwhat made the men that used it of a divine and happy disposition; nor\r\ncould he either think of eating or sleeping, out of his concern and\r\ntorment of mind at what they had said, but all the night long did he\r\ncontinue awake and revolved these notions in his mind.\r\n\r\n4. While he was thus disposed, God appeared to him, and comforted him,\r\nsaying, That he ought not to be uneasy at what the multitude desired,\r\nbecause it was not he, but Himself whom they so insolently despised, and\r\nwould not have to be alone their king; that they had been contriving\r\nthese things from the very day that they came out of Egypt; that however\r\nin no long time they would sorely repent of what they did, which\r\nrepentance yet could not undo what was thus done for futurity; that they\r\nwould be sufficiently rebuked for their contempt, and the ungrateful\r\nconduct they have used towards me, and towards thy prophetic office. \"So\r\nI command thee to ordain them such a one as I shall name beforehand to\r\nbe their king, when thou hast first described what mischiefs kingly\r\ngovernment will bring upon them, and openly testified before them into\r\nwhat a great change of affairs they are hasting.\"\r\n\r\n5. When Samuel had heard this, he called the Jews early in the morning,\r\nand confessed to them that he was to ordain them a king; but he said\r\nthat he was first to describe to them what would follow, what treatment\r\nthey would receive from their kings, and with how many mischiefs they\r\nmust struggle. \"For know ye,\" said he, \"that, in the first place, they\r\nwill take your sons away from you, and they will command some of them to\r\nbe drivers of their chariots, and some to be their horsemen, and the\r\nguards of their body, and others of them to be runners before them, and\r\ncaptains of thousands, and captains of hundreds; they will also make\r\nthem their artificers, makers of armor, and of chariots, and of\r\ninstruments; they will make them their husbandmen also, and the curators\r\nof their own fields, and the diggers of their own vineyards; nor will\r\nthere be any thing which they will not do at their commands, as if they\r\nwere slaves bought with money. They will also appoint your daughters to\r\nbe confectioners, and cooks, and bakers; and these will be obliged to do\r\nall sorts of work which women slaves, that are in fear of stripes and\r\ntorments, submit to. They will, besides this, take away your\r\npossessions, and bestow them upon their eunuchs, and the guards of their\r\nbodies, and will give the herds of your cattle to their own servants:\r\nand to say briefly all at once, you, and all that is yours, will be\r\nservants to your king, and will become no way superior to his slaves;\r\nand when you suffer thus, you will thereby be put in mind of what I now\r\nsay. And when you repent of what you have done, you will beseech God to\r\nhave mercy upon you, and to grant you a quick deliverance from your\r\nkings; but he will not accept your prayers, but will neglect you, and\r\npermit you to suffer the punishment your evil conduct has deserved.\"\r\n\r\n6. But the multitude was still so foolish as to be deaf to these\r\npredictions of what would befall them; and too peevish to suffer a\r\ndetermination which they had injudiciously once made, to be taken out of\r\ntheir mind; for they could not be turned from their purpose, nor did\r\nthey regard the words of Samuel, but peremptorily insisted on their\r\nresolution, and desired him to ordain them a king immediately, and not\r\ntrouble himself with fears of what would happen hereafter, for that it\r\nwas necessary they should have with them one to fight their battles, and\r\nto avenge them of their enemies, and that it was no way absurd, when\r\ntheir neighbors were under kingly government, that they should have the\r\nsame form of government also. So when Samuel saw that what he had said\r\nhad not diverted them from their purpose, but that they continued\r\nresolute, he said, \"Go you every one home for the present; when it is\r\nfit I will send for you, as soon as I shall have learned from God who it\r\nis that he will give you for your king.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. The Appointment Of A King Over The Israelites, Whose Name Was\r\nSaul; And This By The Command Of God.\r\n\r\n1. Ther was one of the tribe of Benjamin, a man of a good family, and of\r\na virtuous disposition; his name was Kish. He had a son, a young man of\r\na comely countenance, and of a tall body, but his understanding and his\r\nmind were preferable to what was visible in him: they called him Saul.\r\nNow this Kish had some fine she-asses that were wandered out of the\r\npasture wherein they fed, for he was more delighted with these than with\r\nany other cattle he had; so he sent out his son, and one servant with\r\nhim, to search for the beasts; but when he had gone over his own tribe\r\nin search after the asses, he went to other tribes, and when he found\r\nthem not there neither, he determined to go his way home, lest he should\r\noccasion any concern to his father about himself. But when his servant\r\nthat followed him told him as they were near the city of Ramah, that\r\nthere was a true prophet in that city, and advised him to go to him, for\r\nthat by him they should know the upshot of the affair of their asses, he\r\nreplied, That if they should go to him, they had nothing to give him as\r\na reward for his prophecy, for their subsistence money was spent. The\r\nservant answered, that he had still the fourth part of a shekel, and he\r\nwould present him with that; for they were mistaken out of ignorance, as\r\nnot knowing that the prophet received no such reward 6 So they went to\r\nhim; and when they were before the gates, they lit upon certain maidens\r\nthat were going to fetch water, and they asked them which was the\r\nprophet's house. They showed them which it was; and bid them make haste\r\nbefore he sat down to supper, for he had invited many guests to a feast,\r\nand that he used to sit down before those that were invited. Now Samuel\r\nhad then gathered many together to feast with him on this very account;\r\nfor while he every day prayed to God to tell him beforehand whom he\r\nwould make king, he had informed him of this man the day before, for\r\nthat he would send him a certain young man out of the tribe of Benjamin\r\nabout this hour of the day; and he sat on the top of the house in\r\nexpectation of that time's being come. And when the time was completed,\r\nhe came down and went to supper; so he met with Saul, and God discovered\r\nto him that this was he who should rule over them. Then Saul went up to\r\nSamuel and saluted him, and desired him to inform him which was the\r\nprophet's house; for he said he was a stranger and did not know it. When\r\nSamuel had told him that he himself was the person, he led him in to\r\nsupper, and assured him that the asses were found which he had been to\r\nseek, and that the greatest of good things were assured to him: he\r\nreplied, \"I am too inconsiderable to hope for any such thing, and of a\r\ntribe to small to have kings made out of it, and of a family smaller\r\nthan several other families; but thou tellest me this in jest, and\r\nmakest me an object of laughter, when thou discoursest with me of\r\ngreater matters than what I stand in need of.\" However, the prophet led\r\nhim in to the feast, and made him sit down, him and his servant that\r\nfollowed him, above the other guests that were invited, which were\r\nseventy in number 7 and he gave orders to the servants to set the royal\r\nportion before Saul. And when the time of going to bed was come, the\r\nrest rose up, and every one of them went home; but Saul staid with the\r\nprophet, he and his servant, and slept with him.\r\n\r\n2. Now as soon as it was day, Samuel raised up Saul out of his bed, and\r\nconducted him homeward; and when he was out of the city, he desired him\r\nto cause his servant to go before, but to stay behind himself, for that\r\nhe had somewhat to say to him when nobody else was present. Accordingly,\r\nSaul sent away his servant that followed him; then did the prophet take\r\na vessel of oil, and poured it upon the head of the young man, and\r\nkissed him, and said, \"Be thou a king, by the ordination of God, against\r\nthe Philistines, and for avenging the Hebrews for what they have\r\nsuffered by them; of this thou shalt have a sign, which I would have\r\nthee take notice of:—As soon as thou art departed hence, thou will find\r\nthree men upon the road, going to worship God at Bethel; the first of\r\nwhom thou wilt see carrying three loaves of bread, the second carrying a\r\nkid of the goats, and the third will follow them carrying a bottle of\r\nwine. These three men will salute thee, and speak kindly to thee, and\r\nwill give thee two of their loaves, which thou shalt accept of. And\r\nthence thou shalt come to a place called Rachel's Monument, where thou\r\nshalt meet with those that will tell thee thy asses are found; after\r\nthis, when thou comest to Gabatha, thou shalt overtake a company of\r\nprophets, and thou shalt be seized with the Divine Spirit, 8 and\r\nprophesy along with them, till every one that sees thee shall be\r\nastonished, and wonder, and say, Whence is it that the son of Kish has\r\narrived at this degree of happiness? And when these signs have happened\r\nto thee, know that God is with thee; then do thou salute thy father and\r\nthy kindred. Thou shalt also come when I send for thee to Gilgal, that\r\nwe may offer thank-offerings to God for these blessings.\" When Samuel\r\nhad said this, and foretold these things, he sent the young man away.\r\nNow all things fell out to Saul according to the prophecy of Samuel.\r\n\r\n3. But as soon as Saul came into the house of his kinsman Abner, whom\r\nindeed he loved better than the rest of his relations, he was asked by\r\nhim concerning his journey, and what accidents happened to him therein;\r\nand he concealed none of the other things from him, no, not his coming\r\nto Samuel the prophet, nor how he told him the asses were found; but he\r\nsaid nothing to him about the kingdom, and what belonged thereto, which\r\nhe thought would procure him envy, and when such things are heard, they\r\nare not easily believed; nor did he think it prudent to tell those\r\nthings to him, although he appeared very friendly to him, and one whom\r\nhe loved above the rest of his relations, considering, I suppose, what\r\nhuman nature really is, that no one is a firm friend, neither among our\r\nintimates, nor of our kindred; nor do they preserve that kind\r\ndisposition when God advances men to great prosperity, but they are\r\nstill ill-natured and envious at those that are in eminent stations.\r\n\r\n4. Then Samuel called the people together to the city Mizpeh, and spake\r\nto them in the words following, which he said he was to speak by the\r\ncommand of God:—That when he had granted them a state of liberty, and\r\nbrought their enemies into subjection, they were become unmindful of his\r\nbenefits, and rejected God that he should not be their King, as not\r\nconsidering that it would be most for their advantage to be presided\r\nover by the best of beings, for God is the best of beings, and they\r\nchose to have a man for their king; while kings will use their subjects\r\nas beasts, according to the violence of their own wills and\r\ninclinations, and other passions, as wholly carried away with the lust\r\nof power, but will not endeavor so to preserve the race of mankind as\r\nhis own workmanship and creation, which, for that very reason, God would\r\ntake cake of. \"But since you have come to a fixed resolution, and this\r\ninjurious treatment of God has quite prevailed over you, dispose\r\nyourselves by your tribes and scepters, and cast lots.\"\r\n\r\n5. When the Hebrews had so done, the lot fell upon the tribe of\r\nBenjamin; and when the lot was cast for the families of this tribe, that\r\nwhich was called Matri was taken; and when the lot was cast for the\r\nsingle persons of that family, Saul, the son of Kish, was taken for\r\ntheir king. When the young man knew this, he prevented [their sending\r\nfor him], and immediately went away and hid himself. I suppose that it\r\nwas because he would not have it thought that he willingly took the\r\ngovernment upon him; nay, he showed such a degree of command over\r\nhimself, and of modesty, that while the greatest part are not able to\r\ncontain their joy, even in the gaining of small advantages, but\r\npresently show themselves publicly to all men, this man did not only\r\nshow nothing of that nature, when he was appointed to be the lord of so\r\nmany and so great tribes, but crept away and concealed himself out of\r\nthe sight of those he was to reign over, and made them seek him, and\r\nthat with a good deal of trouble. So when the people were at a loss, and\r\nsolicitous, because Saul disappeared, the prophet besought God to show\r\nwhere the young man was, and to produce him before them. So when they\r\nhad learned of God the place where Saul was hidden, they sent men to\r\nbring him; and when he was come, they set him in the midst of the\r\nmultitude. Now he was taller than any of them, and his stature was very\r\nmajestic.\r\n\r\n6. Then said the prophet, \"God gives you this man to be your king: see\r\nhow he is higher than any of the people, and worthy of this dominion.\"\r\nSo as soon as the people had made acclamation, God save the king, the\r\nprophet wrote down what would come to pass in a book, and read it in the\r\nhearing of the king, and laid up the book in the tabernacle of God, to\r\nbe a witness to future generations of what he had foretold. So when\r\nSamuel had finished this matter, he dismissed the multitude, and came\r\nhimself to the city Rainah, for it was his own country. Saul also went\r\naway to Gibeah, where he was born; and many good men there were who paid\r\nhim the respect that was due to him; but the greater part were ill men,\r\nwho despised him and derided the others, who neither did bring him\r\npresents, nor did they in affection, or even in words, regard to please\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. Saul's Expedition Against The Nation Of The Ammonites And\r\nVictory Over Them And The Spoils He Took From Them.\r\n\r\n1. After one month, the war which Saul had with Nahash, the king of the\r\nAmmonites, obtained him respect from all the people; for this Nahash had\r\ndone a great deal of mischief to the Jews that lived beyond Jordan by\r\nthe expedition he had made against them with a great and warlike army.\r\nHe also reduced their cities into slavery, and that not only by subduing\r\nthem for the present, which he did by force and violence, but by\r\nweakening them by subtlety and cunning, that they might not be able\r\nafterward to get clear of the slavery they were under to him; for he put\r\nout the right eyes 9 of those that either delivered themselves to him\r\nupon terms, or were taken by him in war; and this he did, that when\r\ntheir left eyes were covered by their shields, they might be wholly\r\nuseless in war. Now when the king of the Ammonites had served those\r\nbeyond Jordan in this manner, he led his army against those that were\r\ncalled Gileadites, and having pitched his camp at the metropolis of his\r\nenemies, which was the city of Jabesh, he sent ambassadors to them,\r\ncommanding them either to deliver themselves up, on condition to have\r\ntheir right eyes plucked out, or to undergo a siege, and to have their\r\ncities overthrown. He gave them their choice, whether they would cut off\r\na small member of their body, or universally perish. However, the\r\nGileadites were so affrighted at these offers, that they had not courage\r\nto say any thing to either of them, neither that they would deliver\r\nthemselves up, nor that they would fight him. But they desired that he\r\nwould give them seven days' respite, that they might send ambassadors to\r\ntheir countrymen, and entreat their assistance; and if they came to\r\nassist them, they would fight; but if that assistance were impossible to\r\nbe obtained from them, they said they would deliver themselves up to\r\nsuffer whatever he pleased to inflict upon them.\r\n\r\n2. So Nabash, contemning the multitude of the Gileadites and the answer\r\nthey gave, allowed them a respite, and gave them leave to send to\r\nwhomsoever they pleased for assistance. So they immediately sent to the\r\nIsraelites, city by city, and informed them what Nabash had threatened\r\nto do to them, and what great distress they were in. Now the people fell\r\ninto tears and grief at the hearing of what the ambassadors from Jabesh\r\nsaid; and the terror they were in permitted them to do nothing more. But\r\nwhen the messengers were come to the city of king Saul, and declared the\r\ndangers in which the inhabitants of Jabesh were, the people were in the\r\nsame affliction as those in the other cities, for they lamented the\r\ncalamity of those related to them. And when Saul was returned from his\r\nhusbandry into the city, he found his fellow citizens weeping; and when,\r\nupon inquiry, he had learned the cause of the confusion and sadness they\r\nwere in, he was seized with a divine fury, and sent away the ambassadors\r\nfrom the inhabitants of Jabesh, and promised them to come to their\r\nassistance on the third day, and to beat their enemies before sun-\r\nrising, that the sun upon its rising might see that they had already\r\nconquered, and were freed from the fears they were under: but he bid\r\nsome of them stay to conduct them the right way to Jabesh.\r\n\r\n3. So being desirous to turn the people to this war against the\r\nAmmonites by fear of the losses they should otherwise undergo, and that\r\nthey might the more suddenly be gathered together, he cut the sinews of\r\nhis oxen, and threatened to do the same to all such as did not come with\r\ntheir armor to Jordan the next day, and follow him and Samuel the\r\nprophet whithersoever they should lead them. So they came together, out\r\nof fear of the losses they were threatened with, at the appointed time.\r\nAnd the multitude were numbered at the city Bezek. And he found the\r\nnumber of those that were gathered together, besides that of the tribe\r\nof Judah, to be seven hundred thousand, while those of that tribe were\r\nseventy thousand. So he passed over Jordan, and proceeded in marching\r\nall that night, thirty furlongs, and came to Jabesh before sun-rising.\r\nSo he divided the army into three companies; and fell upon their enemies\r\non every side on the sudden, and when they expected no such thing; and\r\njoining battle with them, they slew a great many of the Ammonites, as\r\nalso their king Nabash. This glorious action was done by Saul, and was\r\nrelated with great commendation of him to all the Hebrews; and he thence\r\ngained a wonderful reputation for his valor: for although there were\r\nsome of them that contemned him before, they now changed their minds,\r\nand honored him, and esteemed him as the best of men: for he did not\r\ncontent himself with having saved the inhabitants of Jabesh only, but he\r\nmade an expedition into the country of the Ammonites, and laid it all\r\nwaste, and took a large prey, and so returned to his own country most\r\ngloriously. So the people were greatly pleased at these excellent\r\nperformances of Saul, and rejoiced that they had constituted him their\r\nking. They also made a clamor against those that pretended he would be\r\nof no advantage to their affairs; and they said, Where now are these\r\nmen?—let them be brought to punishment, with all the like things that\r\nmultitudes usually say when they are elevated with prosperity, against\r\nthose that lately had despised the authors of it. But Saul, although he\r\ntook the good-will and the affection of these men very kindly, yet did\r\nhe swear that he would not see any of his countrymen slain that day,\r\nsince it was absurd to mix this victory, which God had given them, with\r\nthe blood and slaughter of those that were of the same lineage with\r\nthemselves; and that it was more agreeable to be men of a friendly\r\ndisposition, and so to betake themselves to feasting.\r\n\r\n4. And when Samuel had told them that he ought to confirm the kingdom to\r\nSaul by a second ordination of him, they all came together to the city\r\nof Gilgal, for thither did he command them to come. So the prophet\r\nanointed Saul with the holy oil in the sight of the multitude, and\r\ndeclared him to be king the second time. And so the government of the\r\nHebrews was changed into a regal government; for in the days of Moses,\r\nand his disciple Joshua, who was their general, they continued under an\r\naristocracy; but after the death of Joshua, for eighteen years in all,\r\nthe multitude had no settled form of government, but were in an anarchy;\r\nafter which they returned to their former government, they then\r\npermitting themselves to be judged by him who appeared to be the best\r\nwarrior and most courageous, whence it was that they called this\r\ninterval of their government the Judges.\r\n\r\n5. Then did Samuel the prophet call another assembly also, and said to\r\nthem, \"I solemnly adjure you by God Almighty, who brought those\r\nexcellent brethren, I mean Moses and Aaron, into the world, and\r\ndelivered our fathers from the Egyptians, and from the slavery they\r\nendured under them, that you will not speak what you say to gratify me,\r\nnor suppress any thing out of fear of me, nor be overborne by any other\r\npassion, but say, What have I ever done that was cruel or unjust? or\r\nwhat have I done out of lucre or covetousness, or to gratify others?\r\nBear witness against me, if I have taken an ox or a sheep, or any such\r\nthing, which yet when they are taken to support men, it is esteemed\r\nblameless; or have I taken an ass for mine own use of any one to his\r\ngrief?—lay some one such crime to my charge, now we are in your king's\r\npresence.\" But they cried out, that no such thing had been done by him,\r\nbut that he had presided over the nation after a holy and righteous\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n6. Hereupon Samuel, when such a testimony had been given him by them\r\nall, said, \"Since you grant that you are not able to lay any ill thing\r\nto my charge hitherto, come on now, and do you hearken while I speak\r\nwith great freedom to you. You have been guilty of great impiety against\r\nGod, in asking you a king. It behoves you to remember that our\r\ngrandfather Jacob came down into Egypt, by reason of a famine, with\r\nseventy souls only of our family, and that their posterity multiplied\r\nthere to many ten thousands, whom the Egyptians brought into slavery and\r\nhard oppression; that God himself, upon the prayers of our fathers, sent\r\nMoses and Aaron, who were brethren, and gave them power to deliver the\r\nmultitude out of their distress, and this without a king. These brought\r\nus into this very land which you now possess: and when you enjoyed these\r\nadvantages from God, you betrayed his worship and religion; nay,\r\nmoreover, when you were brought under the hands of your enemies, he\r\ndelivered you, first by rendering you superior to the Assyrians and\r\ntheir forces, he then made you to overcome the Ammonites and the\r\nMoabites, and last of all the Philistines; and these things have been\r\nachieved under the conduct of Jephtha and Gideon. What madness therefore\r\npossessed you to fly from God, and to desire to be under a king?—yet\r\nhave I ordained him for king whom he chose for you. However, that I may\r\nmake it plain to you that God is angry and displeased at your choice of\r\nkingly government, I will so dispose him that he shall declare this very\r\nplainly to you by strange signals; for what none of you ever saw here\r\nbefore, I mean a winter storm in the midst of harvest, 10 I will entreat\r\nof God, and will make it visible to you.\" Now, as soon as he had said\r\nthis, God gave such great signals by thunder and lightning, and the\r\ndescent of hail, as attested the truth of all that the prophet had said,\r\ninsomuch that they were amazed and terrified, and confessed they had\r\nsinned, and had fallen into that sin through ignorance; and besought the\r\nprophet, as one that was a tender and gentle father to them, to render\r\nGod so merciful as to forgive this their sin, which they had added to\r\nthose other offenses whereby they had affronted him and transgressed\r\nagainst him. So he promised them that he would beseech God, and persuade\r\nhim to forgive them these their sins. However, he advised them to be\r\nrighteous, and to be good, and ever to remember the miseries that had\r\nbefallen them on account of their departure from virtue: as also to\r\nremember the strange signs God had shown them, and the body of laws that\r\nMoses had given them, if they had any desire of being preserved and made\r\nhappy with their king. But he said, that if they should grow careless of\r\nthese things, great judgments would come from God upon them, and upon\r\ntheir king. And when Samuel had thus prophesied to the Hebrews, he\r\ndismissed them to their own homes, having confirmed the kingdom to Saul\r\nthe second time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How The Philistines Made Another Expedition Against The\r\nHebrews And Were Beaten.\r\n\r\n1. Now Saul chose out of the multitude about three thousand men, and he\r\ntook two thousand of them to be the guards of his own body, and abode in\r\nthe city Bethel, but he gave the rest of them to Jonathan his son, to be\r\nthe guards of his body; and sent him to Gibeah, where he besieged and\r\ntook a certain garrison of the Philistines, not far from Gilgal; for the\r\nPhilistines of Gibeah had beaten the Jews, and taken their weapons away,\r\nand had put garrisons into the strongest places of the country, and had\r\nforbidden them to carry any instrument of iron, or at all to make use of\r\nany iron in any case whatsoever. And on account of this prohibition it\r\nwas that the husbandmen, if they had occasion to sharpen any of their\r\ntools, whether it were the coulter or the spade, or any instrument of\r\nhusbandry, they came to the Philistines to do it. Now as soon as the\r\nPhilistines heard of this slaughter of their garrison, they were in a\r\nrage about it, and, looking on this contempt as a terrible affront\r\noffered them, they made war against the Jews, with three hundred\r\nthousand footmen, and thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horses;\r\nand they pitched their camp at the city Michmash. When Saul, the king of\r\nthe Hebrews, was informed of this, he went down to the city Gilgal, and\r\nmade proclamation over all the country, that they should try to regain\r\ntheir liberty; and called them to the war against the Philistines,\r\ndiminishing their forces, and despising them as not very considerable,\r\nand as not so great but they might hazard a battle with them. But when\r\nthe people about Saul observed how numerous the Philistines were, they\r\nwere under a great consternation; and some of them hid themselves in\r\ncaves and in dens under ground, but the greater part fled into the land\r\nbeyond Jordan, which belonged to Gad and Reuben.\r\n\r\n2. But Saul sent to the prophet, and called him to consult with him\r\nabout the war and the public affairs; so he commanded him to stay there\r\nfor him, and to prepare sacrifices, for he would come to him within\r\nseven days, that they might offer sacrifices on the seventh day, and\r\nmight then join battle with their enemies. So he waited 11 as the\r\nprophet sent to him to do; yet did not he, however, observe the command\r\nthat was given him, but when he saw that the prophet tarried longer than\r\nhe expected, and that he was deserted by the soldiers, he took the\r\nsacrifices and offered them; and when he heard that Samuel was come, he\r\nwent out to meet him. But the prophet said he had not done well in\r\ndisobeying the injunctions he had sent to him, and had not staid till\r\nhis coming, which being appointed according to the will of God, he had\r\nprevented him in offering up those prayers and those sacrifices that he\r\nshould have made for the multitude, and that he therefore had performed\r\nDivine offices in an ill manner, and had been rash in performing them.\r\nHereupon Saul made an apology for himself, and said that he had waited\r\nas many days as Samuel had appointed him; that he had been so quick in\r\noffering his sacrifices, upon account of the necessity he was in, and\r\nbecause his soldiers were departing from him, out of their fear of the\r\nenemy's camp at Michmash, the report being gone abroad that they were\r\ncoming down upon him of Gilgal. To which Samuel replied, \"Nay,\r\ncertainly, if thou hadst been a righteous man, 12 and hadst not\r\ndisobeyed me, nor slighted the commands which God suggested to me\r\nconcerning the present state of affairs, and hadst not acted more\r\nhastily than the present circumstances required, thou wouldst have been\r\npermitted to reign a long time, and thy posterity after thee.\" So\r\nSamuel, being grieved at what happened, returned home; but Saul came to\r\nthe city Gibeah, with his son Jonathan, having only six hundred men with\r\nhim; and of these the greater part had no weapons, because of the\r\nscarcity of iron in that country, as well as of those that could make\r\nsuch weapons; for, as we showed a little before, the Philistines had not\r\nsuffered them to have such iron or such workmen. Now the Philistines\r\ndivided their army into three companies, and took as many roads, and\r\nlaid waste the country of the Hebrews, while king Saul and his son\r\nJonathan saw what was done, but were not able to defend the land, having\r\nno more than six hundred men with them. But as he, and his son, and\r\nAbiah the high priest, who was of the posterity of Eli the high priest,\r\nwere sitting upon a pretty high hill, and seeing the land laid waste,\r\nthey were mightily disturbed at it. Now Saul's son agreed with his\r\narmor-bearer, that they would go privately to the enemy's camp, and make\r\na tumult and a disturbance among them. And when the armor-bearer had\r\nreadily promised to follow him whithersoever he should lead him, though\r\nhe should be obliged to die in the attempt, Jonathan made use of the\r\nyoung man's assistance, and descended from the hill, and went to their\r\nenemies. Now the enemy's camp was upon a precipice which had three tops,\r\nthat ended in a small but sharp and long extremity, while there was a\r\nrock that surrounded them, like lines made to prevent the attacks of an\r\nenemy. There it so happened, that the out-guards of the camp were\r\nneglected, because of the security that here arose from the situation of\r\nthe place, and because they thought it altogether impossible, not only\r\nto ascend up to the camp on that quarter, but so much as to come near\r\nit. As soon, therefore, as they came to the camp, Jonathan encouraged\r\nhis armor-bearer, and said to him, \"Let us attack our enemies; and if,\r\nwhen they see us, they bid us come up to them, take that for a signal of\r\nvictory; but if they say nothing, as not intending to invite us to come\r\nup, let us return back again.\" So when they were approaching to the\r\nenemy's camp, just after break of day, and the Philistines saw them,\r\nthey said one to another, \"The Hebrews come out of their dens and\r\ncaves:\" and they said to Jonathan and to his armor-bearer, \"Come on,\r\nascend up to us, that we may inflict a just punishment upon you, for\r\nyour rash attempt upon us.\" So Saul's son accepted of that invitation,\r\nas what signified to him victory, and he immediately came out of the\r\nplace whence they were seen by their enemies: so he changed his place,\r\nand came to the rock, which had none to guard it, because of its own\r\nstrength; from thence they crept up with great labor and difficulty, and\r\nso far overcame by force the nature of the place, till they were able to\r\nfight with their enemies. So they fell upon them as they were asleep,\r\nand slew about twenty of them, and thereby filled them with disorder and\r\nsurprise, insomuch that some of them threw away their entire armor and\r\nfled; but the greatest part, not knowing one another, because they were\r\nof different nations, suspected one another to be enemies, [for they did\r\nnot imagine there were only two of the Hebrews that came up,] and so\r\nthey fought one against another; and some of them died in the battle,\r\nand some, as they were flying away, were thrown down from the rock\r\nheadlong.\r\n\r\n3. Now Saul's watchmen told the king that the camp of the Philistines\r\nwas in confusion; then he inquired whether any body was gone away from\r\nthe army; and when he heard that his son, and with him his armor-bearer,\r\nwere absent, he bade the high priest take the garments of his high\r\npriesthood, and prophesy to him what success they should have; who said\r\nthat they should get the victory, and prevail against their enemies. So\r\nhe went out after the Philistines, and set upon them as they were\r\nslaying one another. Those also who had fled to dens and caves, upon\r\nhearing that Saul was gaining a victory, came running to him. When,\r\ntherefore, the number of the Hebrews that came to Saul amounted to about\r\nten thousand, he pursued the enemy, who were scattered all over the\r\ncountry; but then he fell into an action, which was a very unhappy one,\r\nand liable to be very much blamed; for, whether out of ignorance or\r\nwhether out of joy for a victory gained so strangely, [for it frequently\r\nhappens that persons so fortunate are not then able to use their reason\r\nconsistently,] as he was desirous to avenge himself, and to exact a due\r\npunishment of the Philistines, he denounced a curse 13 upon the Hebrews:\r\nThat if any one put a stop to his slaughter of the enemy, and fell on\r\neating, and left off the slaughter or the pursuit before the night came\r\non, and obliged them so to do, he should be accursed. Now after Saul had\r\ndenounced this curse, since they were now in a wood belonging to the\r\ntribe of Ephraim, which was thick and full of bees, Saul's son, who did\r\nnot hear his father denounce that curse, nor hear of the approbation the\r\nmultitude gave to it, broke off a piece of a honey-comb, and ate part of\r\nit. But, in the mean time, he was informed with what a curse his father\r\nhad forbidden them to taste any thing before sun-setting: so he left off\r\neating, and said his father had not done well in this prohibition,\r\nbecause, had they taken some food, they had pursued the enemy with\r\ngreater rigor and alacrity, and had both taken and slain many more of\r\ntheir enemies.\r\n\r\n4. When, therefore, they had slain many ten thousands of the\r\nPhilistines, they fell upon spoiling the camp of the Philistines, but\r\nnot till late in the evening. They also took a great deal of prey and\r\ncattle, and killed them, and ate them with their blood. This was told to\r\nthe king by the scribes, that the multitude were sinning against God as\r\nthey sacrificed, and were eating before the blood was well washed away,\r\nand the flesh was made clean. Then did Saul give order that a great\r\nstone should be rolled into the midst of them, and he made proclamation\r\nthat they should kill their sacrifices upon it, and not feed upon the\r\nflesh with the blood, for that was not acceptable to God. And when all\r\nthe people did as the king commanded them, Saul erected an altar there,\r\nand offered burnt-offerings upon it to God 14 This was the first altar\r\nthat Saul built.\r\n\r\n5. So when Saul was desirous of leading his men to the enemy's camp\r\nbefore it was day, in order to plunder it, and when the soldiers were\r\nnot unwilling to follow him, but indeed showed great readiness to do as\r\nhe commanded them, the king called Ahitub the high priest, and enjoined\r\nhim to know of God whether he would grant them the favor and permission\r\nto go against the enemy's camp, in order to destroy those that were in\r\nit. And when the priest said that God did not give any answer, Saul\r\nreplied, \"And not without some cause does God refuse to answer what we\r\ninquire of him, while yet a little while ago he declared to us all that\r\nwe desired beforehand, and even prevented us in his answer. To be sure\r\nthere is some sin against him that is concealed from us, which is the\r\noccasion of his silence. Now I swear by him himself, that though he that\r\nhath committed this sin should prove to be my own son Jonathan, I will\r\nslay him, and by that means will appease the anger of God against us,\r\nand that in the very same manner as if I were to punish a stranger, and\r\none not at all related to me, for the same offense.\" So when the\r\nmultitude cried out to him so to do, he presently set all the rest on\r\none side, and he and his son stood on the other side, and he sought to\r\ndiscover the offender by lot. Now the lot appeared to fall upon Jonathan\r\nhimself. So when he was asked by his father what sin he had been guilty\r\nof, and what he was conscious of in the course of his life that might be\r\nesteemed instances of guilt or profaneness, his answer was this, \"O\r\nfather, I have done nothing more than that yesterday, without knowing of\r\nthe curse and oath thou hadst denounced, while I was in pursuit of the\r\nenemy, I tasted of a honey-comb.\" But Saul sware that he would slay him,\r\nand prefer the observation of his oath before all the ties of birth and\r\nof nature. And Jonathan was not dismayed at this threatening of death,\r\nbut, offering himself to it generously and undauntedly, he said, \"Nor do\r\nI desire you, father, to spare me: death will be to me very acceptable,\r\nwhen it proceeds from thy piety, and after a glorious victory; for it is\r\nthe greatest consolation to me that I leave the Hebrews victorious over\r\nthe Philistines.\" Hereupon all the people were very sorry, and greatly\r\nafflicted for Jonathan; and they sware that they would not overlook\r\nJonathan, and see him die, who was the author of their victory. By which\r\nmeans they snatched him out of the danger he was in from his father's\r\ncurse, while they made their prayers to God also for the young man, that\r\nhe would remit his sin.\r\n\r\n6. So Saul, having slain about sixty thousand of the enemy, returned\r\nhome to his own city, and reigned happily: and he also fought against\r\nthe neighboring nations, and subdued the Ammonites, and Moabites, and\r\nPhilistines, and Edomites, and Amalekites, as also the king of Zobah. He\r\nhad three male children, Jonathan, and Isui, and Melchishua; with Merab\r\nand Michal his daughters. He had also Abner, his uncle's son, for the\r\ncaptain of his host: that uncle's name was Ner. Now Ner, and Kish the\r\nfather of Saul, were brothers. Saul had also a great many chariots and\r\nhorsemen, and against whomsoever he made war he returned conqueror, and\r\nadvanced the affairs of the Hebrews to a great degree of success and\r\nprosperity, and made them superior to other nations; and he made such of\r\nthe young men as were remarkable for tallness and comeliness the guards\r\nof his body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. Saul's War With The Amalekites, And Conquest Of Them.\r\n\r\n1. Now Samuel came unto Saul, and said to him, that he was sent by God\r\nto put him in mind that God had preferred him before all others, and\r\nordained him king; that he therefore ought to be obedient to him, and to\r\nsubmit to his authority, as considering, that though he had the dominion\r\nover the other tribes, yet that God had the dominion over him, and over\r\nall things. That accordingly God said to him, that \"because the\r\nAmalekites did the Hebrews a great deal of mischief while they were in\r\nthe wilderness, and when, upon their coming out of Egypt, they were\r\nmaking their way to that country which is now their own, I enjoin thee\r\nto punish the Amalekites, by making war upon them; and when thou hast\r\nsubdued them, to leave none of them alive, but to pursue them through\r\nevery age, and to slay them, beginning with the women and the infants,\r\nand to require this as a punishment to be inflicted upon them for the\r\nmischief they did to our forefathers; to spare nothing, neither asses\r\nnor other beasts, nor to reserve any of them for your own advantage and\r\npossession, but to devote them universally to God, and, in obedience to\r\nthe commands of Moses, to blot out the name of Amalek entirely.\" 15\r\n\r\n2. So Saul promised to do what he was commanded; and supposing that his\r\nobedience to God would be shown, not only in making war against the\r\nAmalekites, but more fully in the readiness and quickness of his\r\nproceedings, he made no delay, but immediately gathered together all his\r\nforces; and when he had numbered them in Gilgal, he found them to be\r\nabout four hundred thousand of the Israelites, besides the tribe of\r\nJudah, for that tribe contained by itself thirty thousand. Accordingly,\r\nSaul made an irruption into the country of the Amalekites, and set many\r\nmen in several parties in ambush at the river, that so he might not only\r\ndo them a mischief by open fighting, but might fall upon them\r\nunexpectedly in the ways, and might thereby compass them round about,\r\nand kill them. And when he had joined battle with the enemy, he beat\r\nthem; and pursuing them as they fled, he destroyed them all. And when\r\nthat undertaking had succeeded, according as God had foretold, he set\r\nupon the cities of the Amalekites; he besieged them, and took them by\r\nforce, partly by warlike machines, partly by mines dug under ground, and\r\npartly by building walls on the outsides. Some they starved out with\r\nfamine, and some they gained by other methods; and after all, he betook\r\nhimself to slay the women and the children, and thought he did not act\r\ntherein either barbarously or inhumanly; first, because they were\r\nenemies whom he thus treated, and, in the next place, because it was\r\ndone by the command of God, whom it was dangerous not to obey. He also\r\ntook Agag, the enemies' king, captive,—the beauty and tallness of whose\r\nbody he admired so much, that he thought him worthy of preservation. Yet\r\nwas not this done however according to the will of God, but by giving\r\nway to human passions, and suffering himself to be moved with an\r\nunseasonable commiseration, in a point where it was not safe for him to\r\nindulge it; for God hated the nation of the Amalekites to such a degree,\r\nthat he commanded Saul to have no pity on even those infants which we by\r\nnature chiefly compassionate; but Saul preserved their king and governor\r\nfrom the miseries which the Hebrews brought on the people, as if he\r\npreferred the fine appearance of the enemy to the memory of what God had\r\nsent him about. The multitude were also guilty, together with Saul; for\r\nthey spared the herds and the flocks, and took them for a prey, when God\r\nhad commanded they should not spare them. They also carried off with\r\nthem the rest of their wealth and riches; but if there were any thing\r\nthat was not worthy of regard, that they destroyed.\r\n\r\n3. But when Saul had conquered all these Amalekites that reached from\r\nPelusium of Egypt to the Red Sea, he laid waste all the rest of the\r\nenemy's country: but for the nation of the Shechemites, he did not touch\r\nthem, although they dwelt in the very middle of the country of Midian;\r\nfor before the battle, Saul had sent to them, and charged them to depart\r\nthence, lest they should be partakers of the miseries of the Amalekites;\r\nfor he had a just occasion for saving them, since they were of the\r\nkindred of Raguel, Moses's father-in-law.\r\n\r\n4. Hereupon Saul returned home with joy, for the glorious things he had\r\ndone, and for the conquest of his enemies, as though he had not\r\nneglected any thing which the prophet had enjoined him to do when he was\r\ngoing to make war with the Amalekites, and as though he had exactly\r\nobserved all that he ought to have done. But God was grieved that the\r\nking of the Amalekites was preserved alive, and that the multitude had\r\nseized on the cattle for a prey, because these things were done without\r\nhis permission; for he thought it an intolerable thing that they should\r\nconquer and overcome their enemies by that power which he gave them, and\r\nthen that he himself should be so grossly despised and disobeyed by\r\nthem, that a mere man that was a king would not bear it. He therefore\r\ntold Samuel the prophet, that he repented that he had made Saul king,\r\nwhile he did nothing that he had commanded him, but indulged his own\r\ninclinations. When Samuel heard that, he was in confusion, and began to\r\nbeseech God all that night to be reconciled to Saul, and not to be angry\r\nwith him; but he did not grant that forgiveness to Saul which the\r\nprophet asked for, as not deeming it a fit thing to grant forgiveness of\r\n[such] sins at his entreaties, since injuries do not otherwise grow so\r\ngreat as by the easy tempers of those that are injured; or while they\r\nhunt after the glory of being thought gentle and good-natured, before\r\nthey are aware they produce other sins. As soon therefore as God had\r\nrejected the intercession of the prophet, and it plainly appeared he\r\nwould not change his mind, at break of day Samuel came to Saul at\r\nGilgal. When the king saw him, he ran to him, and embraced him, and\r\nsaid, \"I return thanks to God, who hath given me the victory, for I have\r\nperformed every thing that he hath commanded me.\" To which Samuel\r\nreplied, \"How is it then that I hear the bleating of the sheep and the\r\nlowing of the greater cattle in the camp?\" Saul made answer, That the\r\npeople had reserved them for sacrifices; but that, as to the nation of\r\nthe Amalekites, it was entirely destroyed, as he had received it in\r\ncommand to see done, and that no one man was left; but that he had saved\r\nalive the king alone, and brought him to him, concerning whom, he said,\r\nthey would advise together what should be done with him. But the prophet\r\nsaid, \"God is not delighted with sacrifices, but with good and with\r\nrighteous men, who are such as follow his will and his laws, and never\r\nthink that any thing is well done by them but when they do it as God had\r\ncommanded them; that he then looks upon himself as affronted, not when\r\nany one does not sacrifice, but when any one appears to be disobedient\r\nto him. But that from those who do not obey him, nor pay him that duty\r\nwhich is the alone true and acceptable worship, he will not kindly\r\naccept their oblations, be those they offer ever so many and so fat, and\r\nbe the presents they make him ever so ornamental, nay, though they were\r\nmade of gold and silver themselves, but he will reject them, and esteem\r\nthem instances of wickedness, and not of piety. And that he is delighted\r\nwith those that still bear in mind this one thing, and this only, how to\r\ndo that, whatsoever it be, which God pronounces or commands for them to\r\ndo, and to choose rather to die than to transgress any of those\r\ncommands; nor does he require so much as a sacrifice from them. And when\r\nthese do sacrifice, though it be a mean oblation, he better accepts of\r\nit as the honor of poverty, than such oblations as come from the richest\r\nmen that offer them to him. Wherefore take notice, that thou art under\r\nthe wrath of God, for thou hast despised and neglected what he commanded\r\nthee. How dost thou then suppose that he will respect a sacrifice out of\r\nsuch things as he hath doomed to destruction? unless perhaps thou dost\r\nimagine that it is almost all one to offer it in sacrifice to God as to\r\ndestroy it. Do thou therefore expect that thy kingdom will be taken from\r\nthee, and that authority which thou hast abused by such insolent\r\nbehavior, as to neglect that God who bestowed it upon thee.\" Then did\r\nSaul confess that he had acted unjustly, and did not deny that he had\r\nsinned, because he had transgressed the injunctions of the prophet; but\r\nhe said that it was out of a dread and fear of the soldiers, that he did\r\nnot prohibit and restrain them when they seized on the prey. \"But\r\nforgive me,\" said he, \"and be merciful to me, for I will be cautious how\r\nI offend for the time to come.\" He also entreated the prophet to go back\r\nwith him, that he might offer his thank-offerings to God; but Samuel\r\nwent home, because he saw that God would not be reconciled to him.\r\n\r\n5. But then Saul was so desirous to retain Samuel, that he took hold of\r\nhis cloak, and because the vehemence of Samuel's departure made the\r\nmotion to be violent, the cloak was rent. Upon which the prophet said,\r\nthat after the same manner should the kingdom be rent from him, and that\r\na good and a just man should take it; that God persevered in what he had\r\ndecreed about him; that to be mutable and changeable in what is\r\ndetermined, is agreeable to human passions only, but is not agreeable to\r\nthe Divine Power. Hereupon Saul said that he had been wicked, but that\r\nwhat was done could not be undone: he therefore desired him to honor him\r\nso far, that the multitude might see that he would accompany him in\r\nworshipping God. So Samuel granted him that favor, and went with him and\r\nworshipped God. Agag also, the king of the Amalekites, was brought to\r\nhim; and when the king asked, How bitter death was? Samuel said, \"As\r\nthou hast made many of the Hebrew mothers to lament and bewail the loss\r\nof their children, so shalt thou, by thy death, cause thy mother to\r\nlament thee also.\" Accordingly, he gave order to slay him immediately at\r\nGilgal, and then went away to the city Ramah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. How, Upon Saul's Transgression Of The Prophet's Commands,\r\nSamuel Ordained Another Person To Be King Privately, Whose Name Was\r\nDavid, As God Commanded Him.\r\n\r\n1. Now Saul being sensible of the miserable condition he had brought\r\nhimself into, and that he had made God to be his enemy, he went up to\r\nhis royal palace at Gibeah, which name denotes a hill, and after that\r\nday he came no more into the presence of the prophet. And when Samuel\r\nmourned for him, God bid him leave off his concern for him, and to take\r\nthe holy oil, and go to Bethlehem, to Jesse the son of Obed, and to\r\nanoint such of his sons as he should show him for their future king. But\r\nSamuel said, he was afraid lest Saul, when he came to know of it, should\r\nkill him, either by some private method or even openly. But upon God's\r\nsuggesting to him a safe way of going thither, he came to the\r\nforementioned city; and when they all saluted him, and asked what was\r\nthe occasion of his coming, he told them he came to sacrifice to God.\r\nWhen, therefore, he had gotten the sacrifice ready, he called Jesse and\r\nhis sons to partake of those sacrifices; and when he saw his eldest son\r\nto be a tall and handsome man, he guessed by his comeliness that he was\r\nthe person who was to be their future king. But he was mistaken in\r\njudging about God's providence; for when Samuel inquired of God whether\r\nhe should anoint this youth, whom he so admired, and esteemed worthy of\r\nthe kingdom, God said, \"Men do not see as God seeth. Thou indeed hast\r\nrespect to the fine appearance of this youth, and thence esteemest him\r\nworthy of the kingdom, while I propose the kingdom as a reward, not of\r\nthe beauty of bodies, but of the virtue of souls, and I inquire after\r\none that is perfectly comely in that respect; I mean one who is\r\nbeautiful in piety, and righteousness, and fortitude, and obedience, for\r\nin them consists the comeliness of the soul.\" When God had said this,\r\nSamuel bade Jesse to show him all his sons. So he made five others of\r\nhis sons to come to him; of all of whom Eliab was the eldest, Aminadab\r\nthe second, Shammall the third, Nathaniel the fourth, Rael the fifth,\r\nand Asam the sixth. And when the prophet saw that these were no way\r\ninferior to the eldest in their countenances, he inquired of God which\r\nof them it was whom he chose for their king. And when God said it was\r\nnone of them, he asked Jesse whether he had not some other sons besides\r\nthese; and when he said that he had one more, named David, but that he\r\nwas a shepherd, and took care of the flocks, Samuel bade them call him\r\nimmediately, for that till he was come they could not possibly sit down\r\nto the feast. Now, as soon as his father had sent for David, and he was\r\ncome, he appeared to be of a yellow complexion, of a sharp sight, and a\r\ncomely person in other respects also. This is he, said Samuel privately\r\nto himself, whom it pleases God to make our king. So he sat down to the\r\nfeast, and placed the youth under him, and Jesse also, with his other\r\nsons; after which he took oil in the presence of David, and anointed\r\nhim, and whispered him in the ear, and acquainted him that God chose him\r\nto be their king; and exhorted him to be righteous, and obedient to his\r\ncommands, for that by this means his kingdom would continue for a long\r\ntime, and that his house should be of great splendor, and celebrated in\r\nthe world; that he should overthrow the Philistines; and that against\r\nwhat nations soever he should make war, he should be the conqueror, and\r\nsurvive the fight; and that while he lived he should enjoy a glorious\r\nname, and leave such a name to his posterity also.\r\n\r\n2. So Samuel, when he had given him these admonitions, went away. But\r\nthe Divine Power departed from Saul, and removed to David; who, upon\r\nthis removal of the Divine Spirit to him, began to prophesy. But as for\r\nSaul, some strange and demoniacal disorders came upon him, and brought\r\nupon him such suffocations as were ready to choke him; for which the\r\nphysicians could find no other remedy but this, That if any person could\r\ncharm those passions by singing, and playing upon the harp, they advised\r\nthem to inquire for such a one, and to observe when these demons came\r\nupon him and disturbed him, and to take care that such a person might\r\nstand over him, and play upon the harp, and recite hymns to him. 16\r\nAccordingly Saul did not delay, but commanded them to seek out such a\r\nman. And when a certain stander-by said that he had seen in the city of\r\nBethlehem a son of Jesse, who was yet no more than a child in age, but\r\ncomely and beautiful, and in other respects one that was deserving of\r\ngreat regard, who was skillful in playing on the harp, and in singing of\r\nhymns, [and an excellent soldier in war,] he sent to Jesse, and desired\r\nhim to take David away from the flocks, and send him to him, for he had\r\na mind to see him, as having heard an advantageous character of his\r\ncomeliness and his valor. So Jesse sent his son, and gave him presents\r\nto carry to Saul. And when he was come, Saul was pleased with him, and\r\nmade him his armor-bearer, and had him in very great esteem; for he\r\ncharmed his passion, and was the only physician against the trouble he\r\nhad from the demons, whensoever it was that it came upon him, and this\r\nby reciting of hymns, and playing upon the harp, and bringing Saul to\r\nhis right mind again. However, he sent to Jesse, the father of the\r\nchild, and desired him to permit David to stay with him, for that he was\r\ndelighted with his sight and company; which stay, that he might not\r\ncontradict Saul, he granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. How The Philistines Made Another Expedition Against The\r\nHebrews Under The Reign Of Saul; And How They Were Overcome By David's\r\nSlaying Goliath In Single Combat.\r\n\r\n1. Now the Philistines gathered themselves together again no very long\r\ntime afterward; and having gotten together a great army, they made war\r\nagainst the Israelites; and having seized a place between Shochoh and\r\nAzekah, they there pitched their camp. Saul also drew out his army to\r\noppose them; and by pitching his own camp on a certain hill, he forced\r\nthe Philistines to leave their former camp, and to encamp themselves\r\nupon such another hill, over-against that on which Saul's army lay, so\r\nthat a valley, which was between the two hills on which they lay,\r\ndivided their camps asunder. Now there came down a man out of the camp\r\nof the Philistines, whose name was Goliath, of the city of Gath, a man\r\nof vast bulk, for he was of four cubits and a span in tallness, and had\r\nabout him weapons suitable to the largeness of his body, for he had a\r\nbreastplate on that weighed five thousand shekels: he had also a helmet\r\nand greaves of brass, as large as you would naturally suppose might\r\ncover the limbs of so vast a body. His spear was also such as was not\r\ncarried like a light thing in his right hand, but he carried it as lying\r\non his shoulders. He had also a lance of six hundred shekels; and many\r\nfollowed him to carry his armor. Wherefore this Goliath stood between\r\nthe two armies, as they were in battle array, and sent out aloud voice,\r\nand said to Saul and the Hebrews, \"I will free you from fighting and\r\nfrom dangers; for what necessity is there that your army should fall and\r\nbe afflicted? Give me a man of you that will fight with me, and he that\r\nconquers shall have the reward of the conqueror and determine the war;\r\nfor these shall serve those others to whom the conqueror shall belong;\r\nand certainly it is much better, and more prudent, to gain what you\r\ndesire by the hazard of one man than of all.\" When he had said this, he\r\nretired to his own camp; but the next day he came again, and used the\r\nsame words, and did not leave off for forty days together, to challenge\r\nthe enemy in the same words, till Saul and his army were therewith\r\nterrified, while they put themselves in array as if they would fight,\r\nbut did not come to a close battle.\r\n\r\n2. Now while this war between the Hebrews and the Philistines was going\r\non, Saul sent away David to his father Jesse, and contented himself with\r\nthose three sons of his whom he had sent to his assistance, and to be\r\npartners in the dangers of the war: and at first David returned to feed\r\nhis sheep and his flocks; but after no long time he came to the camp of\r\nthe Hebrews, as sent by his father, to carry provisions to his brethren,\r\nand to know what they were doing. While Goliath came again, and\r\nchallenged them, and reproached them, that they had no man of valor\r\namong them that durst come down to fight him; and as David was talking\r\nwith his brethren about the business for which his father had sent him,\r\nhe heard the Philistine reproaching and abusing the army, and had\r\nindignation at it, and said to his brethren, \"I am ready to fight a\r\nsingle combat with this adversary.\" Whereupon Eliab, his eldest brother,\r\nreproved him, and said that he spoke too rashly and improperly for one\r\nof his age, and bid him go to his flocks, and to his father. So he was\r\nabashed at his brother's words, and went away, but still he spake to\r\nsome of the soldiers that he was willing to fight with him that\r\nchallenged them. And when they had informed Saul what was the resolution\r\nof the young man, the king sent for him to come to him: and when the\r\nking asked what he had to say, he replied, \"O king, be not cast down,\r\nnor afraid, for I will depress the insolence of this adversary, and will\r\ngo down and fight with him, and will bring him under me, as tall and as\r\ngreat as he is, till he shall be sufficiently laughed at, and thy army\r\nshall get great glory, when he shall be slain by one that is not yet of\r\nman's estate, neither fit for fighting, nor capable of being intrusted\r\nwith the marshalling an army, or ordering a battle, but by one that\r\nlooks like a child, and is really no elder in age than a child.\"\r\n\r\n3. Now Saul wondered at the boldness and alacrity of David, but durst\r\nnot presume on his ability, by reason of his age; but said he must on\r\nthat account be too weak to fight with one that was skilled in the art\r\nof war. \"I undertake this enterprise,\" said David, \"in dependence on\r\nGod's being with me, for I have had experience already of his\r\nassistance; for I once pursued after and caught a lion that assaulted my\r\nflocks, and took away a lamb from them; and I snatched the lamb out of\r\nthe wild beast's mouth, and when he leaped upon me with violence, I took\r\nhim by the tail, and dashed him against the ground. In the same manner\r\ndid I avenge myself on a bear also; and let this adversary of ours be\r\nesteemed like one of these wild beasts, since he has a long while\r\nreproached our army, and blasphemed our God, who yet will reduce him\r\nunder my power.\"\r\n\r\n4. However, Saul prayed that the end might be, by God's assistance, not\r\ndisagreeable to the alacrity and boldness of the child; and said, \"Go\r\nthy way to the fight.\" So he put about him his breastplate, and girded\r\non his sword, and fitted the helmet to his head, and sent him away. But\r\nDavid was burdened with his armor, for he had not been exercised to it,\r\nnor had he learned to walk with it; so he said, \"Let this armor be\r\nthine, O king, who art able to bear it; but give me leave to fight as\r\nthy servant, and as I myself desire.\" Accordingly he laid by the armor,\r\nand taking his staff with him, and putting five stones out of the brook\r\ninto a shepherd's bag, and having a sling in his right hand, he went\r\ntowards Goliath. But the adversary seeing him come in such a manner,\r\ndisdained him, and jested upon him, as if he had not such weapons with\r\nhim as are usual when one man fights against another, but such as are\r\nused in driving away and avoiding of dogs; and said, \"Dost thou take me\r\nnot for a man, but a dog?\" To which he replied, \"No, not for a dog, but\r\nfor a creature worse than a dog.\" This provoked Goliath to anger, who\r\nthereupon cursed him by the name of God, and threatened to give his\r\nflesh to the beasts of the earth, and to the fowls of the air, to be\r\ntorn in pieces by them. To whom David answered, \"Thou comest to me with\r\na sword, and with a spear, and with a breastplate; but I have God for my\r\narmor in coming against thee, who will destroy thee and all thy army by\r\nmy hands for I will this day cut off thy head, and cast the other parts\r\nof thy body to the dogs, and all men shall learn that God is the\r\nprotector of the Hebrews, and that our armor and our strength is in his\r\nprovidence; and that without God's assistance, all other warlike\r\npreparations and power are useless.\" So the Philistine being retarded by\r\nthe weight of his armor, when he attempted to meet David in haste, came\r\non but slowly, as despising him, and depending upon it that he should\r\nslay him, who was both unarmed and a child also, without any trouble at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n5. But the youth met his antagonist, being accompanied with an invisible\r\nassistant, who was no other than God himself. And taking one of the\r\nstones that he had out of the brook, and had put into his shepherd's\r\nbag, and fitting it to his sling, he slang it against the Philistine.\r\nThis stone fell upon his forehead, and sank into his brain, insomuch\r\nthat Goliath was stunned, and fell upon his face. So David ran, and\r\nstood upon his adversary as he lay down, and cut off his head with his\r\nown sword; for he had no sword himself. And upon the fall of Goliath the\r\nPhilistines were beaten, and fled; for when they saw their champion\r\nprostrate on the ground, they were afraid of the entire issue of their\r\naffairs, and resolved not to stay any longer, but committed themselves\r\nto an ignominious and indecent flight, and thereby endeavored to save\r\nthemselves from the dangers they were in. But Saul and the entire army\r\nof the Hebrews made a shout, and rushed upon them, and slew a great\r\nnumber of them, and pursued the rest to the borders of Garb, and to the\r\ngates of Ekron; so that there were slain of the Philistines thirty\r\nthousand, and twice as many wounded. But Saul returned to their camp,\r\nand pulled their fortification to pieces, and burnt it; but David\r\ncarried the head of Goliath into his own tent, but dedicated his sword\r\nto God [at the tabernacle].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. Saul Envies David For His Glorious Success, And Takes An\r\nOccasion Of Entrapping Him, From The Promise He Made Him Of Giving Him\r\nHis Daughter In Marriage; But This Upon Condition Of His Bringing Him\r\nSix Hundred Heads Of The Philistines.\r\n\r\n1. Now the women were an occasion of Saul's envy and hatred to David;\r\nfor they came to meet their victorious army with cymbals, and drums, and\r\nall demonstrations of joy, and sang thus: The wives said, that \"Saul had\r\nslain his many thousands of the Philistines.\" The virgins replied, that\r\n\"David had slain his ten thousands.\" Now, when the king heard them\r\nsinging thus, and that he had himself the smallest share in their\r\ncommendations, and the greater number, the ten thousands, were ascribed\r\nto the young man; and when he considered with himself that there was\r\nnothing more wanting to David, after such a mighty applause, but the\r\nkingdom; he began to be afraid and suspicious of David. Accordingly he\r\nremoved him from the station he was in before, for he was his armor-\r\nbearer, which, out of fear, seemed to him much too near a station for\r\nhim; and so he made him captain over a thousand, and bestowed on him a\r\npost better indeed in itself, but, as he thought, more for his own\r\nsecurity; for he had a mind to send him against the enemy, and into\r\nbattles, as hoping he would be slain in such dangerous conflicts.\r\n\r\n2. But David had God going along with him whithersoever he went, and\r\naccordingly he greatly prospered in his undertakings, and it was visible\r\nthat he had mighty success, insomuch that Saul's daughter, who was still\r\na virgin, fell in love with him; and her affection so far prevailed over\r\nher, that it could not be concealed, and her father became acquainted\r\nwith it. Now Saul heard this gladly, as intending to make use of it for\r\na snare against David, and he hoped that it would prove the cause of\r\ndestruction and of hazard to him; so he told those that informed him of\r\nhis daughter's affection, that he would willingly give David the virgin\r\nin marriage, and said, \"I engage myself to marry my daughter to him if\r\nhe will bring me six hundred heads of my enemies 17 supposing that when\r\na reward so ample was proposed to him, and when he should aim to get him\r\ngreat glory, by undertaking a thing so dangerous and incredible, he\r\nwould immediately set about it, and so perish by the Philistines; and my\r\ndesigns about him will succeed finely to my mind, for I shall be freed\r\nfrom him, and get him slain, not by myself, but by another man.\" So he\r\ngave order to his servants to try how David would relish this proposal\r\nof marrying the damsel. Accordingly, they began to speak thus to him:\r\nThat king Saul loved him, as well as did all the people, and that he was\r\ndesirous of his affinity by the marriage of this damsel. To which he\r\ngave this answer:—\"Seemeth it to you a light thing to be made the king's\r\nson-in-law? It does not seem so to me, especially when I am one of a\r\nfamily that is low, and without any glory or honor.\" Now when Saul was\r\ninformed by his servants what answer David had made, he said,—\"Tell him\r\nthat I do not want any money nor dowry from him, which would be rather\r\nto set my daughter to sale than to give her in marriage; but I desire\r\nonly such a son-in-law as hath in him fortitude, and all other kinds of\r\nvirtue,\" of which he saw David was possessed, and that his desire was to\r\nreceive of him, on account of his marrying his daughter, neither gold\r\nnor silver, nor that he should bring such wealth out of his father's\r\nhouse, but only some revenge on the Philistines, and indeed six hundred\r\nof their heads, than which a more desirable or a more glorious present\r\ncould not be brought him, and that he had much rather obtain this, than\r\nany of the accustomed dowries for his daughter, viz. that she should be\r\nmarried to a man of that character, and to one who had a testimony as\r\nhaving conquered his enemies.\r\n\r\n3. When these words of Saul were brought to David, he was pleased with\r\nthem, and supposed that Saul was really desirous of this affinity with\r\nhim; so that without bearing to deliberate any longer, or casting about\r\nin his mind whether what was proposed was possible, or was difficult or\r\nnot, he and his companions immediately set upon the enemy, and went\r\nabout doing what was proposed as the condition of the marriage.\r\nAccordingly, because it was God who made all things easy and possible to\r\nDavid, he slew many [of the Philistines], and cut off the heads of six\r\nhundred of them, and came to the king, and by showing him these heads of\r\nthe Philistines, required that he might have his daughter in marriage.\r\nAccordingly, Saul having no way of getting off his engagements, as\r\nthinking it a base thing either to seem a liar when he promised him this\r\nmarriage, or to appear to have acted treacherously by him, in putting\r\nhim upon what was in a manner impossible, in order to have him slain, he\r\ngave him his daughter in marriage: her name was Michal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. How David, Upon Saul's Laying Snares For Him, Did Yet Escape\r\nThe Dangers He Was In By The Affection And Care Of Jonathan And The\r\nContrivances Of His Wife Michal: And How He Came To Samuel The Prophet.\r\n\r\n1. However, Saul was not disposed to persevere long in the state wherein\r\nhe was, for when he saw that David was in great esteem, both with God\r\nand with the multitude, he was afraid; and being not able to conceal his\r\nfear as concerning great things, his kingdom and his life, to be\r\ndeprived of either of which was a very great calamity, he resolved to\r\nhave David slain, and commanded his son Jonathan and his most faithful\r\nservants to kill him: but Jonathan wondered at his father's change with\r\nrelation to David, that it should be made to so great a degree, from\r\nshowing him no small good-will, to contrive how to have him killed. Now,\r\nbecause he loved the young man, and reverenced him for his virtue, he\r\ninformed him of the secret charge his father had given, and what his\r\nintentions were concerning him. However, he advised him to take care and\r\nbe absent the next day, for that he would salute his father, and, if he\r\nmet with a favorable opportunity, he would discourse with him about him,\r\nand learn the cause of his disgust, and show how little ground there was\r\nfor it, and that for it he ought not to kill a man that had done so many\r\ngood things to the multitude, and had been a benefactor to himself, on\r\naccount of which he ought in reason to obtain pardon, had he been guilty\r\nof the greatest crimes; and \"I will then inform thee of my father's\r\nresolution.\" Accordingly David complied with such an advantageous\r\nadvice, and kept himself then out of the king's sight.\r\n\r\n2. On the next day Jonathan came to Saul, as soon as he saw him in a\r\ncheerful and joyful disposition, and began to introduce a discourse\r\nabout David: \"What unjust action, O father, either little or great, hast\r\nthou found so exceptionable in David, as to induce thee to order us to\r\nslay a man who hath been of great advantage to thy own preservation, and\r\nof still greater to the punishment of the Philistines? A man who hath\r\ndelivered the people of the Hebrews from reproach and derision, which\r\nthey underwent for forty days together, when he alone had courage enough\r\nto sustain the challenge of the adversary, and after that brought as\r\nmany heads of our enemies as he was appointed to bring, and had, as a\r\nreward for the same, my sister in marriage; insomuch that his death\r\nwould be very sorrowful to us, not only on account of his virtue, but on\r\naccount of the nearness of our relation; for thy daughter must be\r\ninjured at the same time that he is slain, and must be obliged to\r\nexperience widowhood, before she can come to enjoy any advantage from\r\ntheir mutual conversation. Consider these things, and change your mind\r\nto a more merciful temper, and do no mischief to a man, who, in the\r\nfirst place, hath done us the greatest kindness of preserving thee; for\r\nwhen an evil spirit and demons had seized upon thee, he cast them out,\r\nand procured rest to thy soul from their incursions: and, in the second\r\nplace, hath avenged us of our enemies; for it is a base thing to forget\r\nsuch benefits.\" So Saul was pacified with these words, and sware to his\r\nson that he would do David no harm, for a righteous discourse proved too\r\nhard for the king's anger and fear. So Jonathan sent for David, and\r\nbrought him good news from his father, that he was to be preserved. He\r\nalso brought him to his father; and David continued with the king as\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\n3. About this time it was that, upon the Philistines making a new\r\nexpedition against the Hebrews, Saul sent David with an army to fight\r\nwith them; and joining battle with them he slew many of them, and after\r\nhis victory he returned to the king. But his reception by Saul was not\r\nas he expected upon such success, for he was grieved at his prosperity,\r\nbecause he thought he would be more dangerous to him by having acted so\r\ngloriously: but when the demoniacal spirit came upon him, and put him\r\ninto disorder, and disturbed him, he called for David into his bed-\r\nchamber wherein he lay, and having a spear in his hand, he ordered him\r\nto charm him with playing on his harp, and with singing hymns; which\r\nwhen David did at his command, he with great force threw the spear at\r\nhim; but David was aware of it before it came, and avoided it, and fled\r\nto his own house, and abode there all that day.\r\n\r\n4. But at night the king sent officers, and commanded that he should be\r\nwatched till the morning, lest he should get quite away, that he might\r\ncome into the judgment-hall, and so might be delivered up, and condemned\r\nand slain. But when Michal, David's wife, the king's daughter,\r\nunderstood what her father designed, she came to her husband, as having\r\nsmall hopes of his deliverance, and as greatly concerned about her own\r\nlife also, for she could not bear to live in case she were deprived of\r\nhim; and she said, \"Let not the sun find thee here when it rises, for if\r\nit do, that will be the last time it will see thee: fly away then while\r\nthe night may afford thee opportunity, and may God lengthen it for thy\r\nsake; for know this, that if my father find thee, thou art a dead man.\"\r\nSo she let him down by a cord out of the window, and saved him: and\r\nafter she had done so, she fitted up a bed for him as if he were sick,\r\nand put under the bed-clothes a goat's liver 18 and when her father, as\r\nsoon as it was day, sent to seize David, she said to those that were\r\nthere, That he had not been well that night, and showed them the bed\r\ncovered, and made them believe, by the leaping of the liver, which\r\ncaused the bed-clothes to move also, that David breathed like one that\r\nwas asthmatic. So when those that were sent told Saul that David had not\r\nbeen well in the night he ordered him to be brought in that condition,\r\nfor he intended to kill him. Now when they came and uncovered the bed,\r\nand found out the woman's contrivance, they told it to the king; and\r\nwhen her father complained of her that she had saved his enemy, and had\r\nput a trick upon himself, she invented this plausible defense for\r\nherself, and said, That when he had threatened to kill her, she lent him\r\nher assistance for his preservation, out of fear; for which her\r\nassistance she ought to be forgiven, because it was not done of her own\r\nfree choice, but out of necessity: \"For,\" said she, \"I do not suppose\r\nthat thou wast so zealous to kill thy enemy, as thou wast that I should\r\nbe saved.\" Accordingly Saul forgave the damsel; but David, when he had\r\nescaped this danger, came to the prophet Samuel to Ramah, and told him\r\nwhat snares the king had laid for him, and how he was very near to death\r\nby Saul's throwing a spear at him, although he had been no way guilty\r\nwith relation to him, nor had he been cowardly in his battles with his\r\nenemies, but had succeeded well in them all, by God's assistance; which\r\nthing was indeed the cause of Saul's hatred to David.\r\n\r\n5. When the prophet was made acquainted with the unjust proceedings of\r\nthe king, he left the city Ramah, and took David with him, to a certain\r\nplace called Naioth, and there he abode with him. But when it was told\r\nSaul that David was with the prophet, he sent soldiers to him, and\r\nordered them to take him, and bring him to him: and when they came to\r\nSamuel, and found there a congregation of prophets, they became\r\npartakers of the Divine Spirit, and began to prophesy; which when Saul\r\nheard of, he sent others to David, who prophesying in like manner as did\r\nthe first, he again sent others; which third sort prophesying also, at\r\nlast he was angry, and went thither in great haste himself; and when he\r\nwas just by the place, Samuel, before he saw him, made him prophesy\r\nalso. And when Saul came to him, he was disordered in mind 19 and under\r\nthe vehement agitation of a spirit; and, putting off his garments, 20 he\r\nfell down, and lay on the ground all that day and night, in the presence\r\nof Samuel and David.\r\n\r\n6. And David went thence, and came to Jonathan, the son of Saul, and\r\nlamented to him what snares were laid for him by his father; and said,\r\nthat though he had been guilty of no evil, nor had offended against him,\r\nyet he was very zealous to get him killed. Hereupon Jonathan exhorted\r\nhim not to give credit to such his own suspicions, nor to the calumnies\r\nof those that raised those reports, if there were any that did so, but\r\nto depend on him, and take courage; for that his father had no such\r\nintention, since he would have acquainted him with that matter, and have\r\ntaken his advice, had it been so, as he used to consult with him in\r\ncommon when he acted in other affairs. But David sware to him that so it\r\nwas; and he desired him rather to believe him, and to provide for his\r\nsafety, than to despise what he, with great sincerity, told him: that he\r\nwould believe what he said, when he should either see him killed\r\nhimself, or learn it upon inquiry from others: and that the reason why\r\nhis father did not tell him of these things, was this, that he knew of\r\nthe friendship and affection that he bore towards him.\r\n\r\n7. Hereupon, when Jonathan found that this intention of Saul was so well\r\nattested, he asked him what he would have him do for him. To which David\r\nreplied, \"I am sensible that thou art willing to gratify me in every\r\nthing, and procure me what I desire. Now tomorrow is the new moon, and I\r\nwas accustomed to sit down then with the king at supper: now, if it seem\r\ngood to thee, I will go out of the city, and conceal myself privately\r\nthere; and if Saul inquire why I am absent, tell him that I am gone to\r\nmy own city Bethlehem, to keep a festival with my own tribe; and add\r\nthis also, that thou gavest me leave so to do. And if he say, as is\r\nusually said in the case of friends that are gone abroad, It is well\r\nthat he went, then assure thyself that no latent mischief or enmity may\r\nbe feared at his hand; but if he answer otherwise, that will be a sure\r\nsign that he hath some designs against me, Accordingly thou shalt inform\r\nme of thy father's inclinations; and that out of pity to my case and out\r\nof thy friendship for me, as instances of which friendship thou hast\r\nvouchsafed to accept of the assurances of my love to thee, and to give\r\nthe like assurances to me, that is, those of a master to his servant;\r\nbut if thou discoverest any wickedness in me, do thou prevent thy\r\nfather, and kill me thyself.\"\r\n\r\n8. But Jonathan heard these last words with indignation, and promised to\r\ndo what he desired of him, and to inform him if his father's answers\r\nimplied any thing of a melancholy nature, and any enmity against him.\r\nAnd that he might the more firmly depend upon him, he took him out into\r\nthe open field, into the pure air, and sware that he would neglect\r\nnothing that might tend to the preservation of David; and he said, \"I\r\nappeal to that God, who, as thou seest, is diffused every where, and\r\nknoweth this intention of mine, before I explain it in words, as the\r\nwitness of this my covenant with thee, that I will not leave off to make\r\nfrequent trims of the purpose of my father till I learn whether there be\r\nany lurking distemper in the most secret parts of his soul; and when I\r\nhave learnt it, I will not conceal it from thee, but will discover it to\r\nthee, whether he be gently or peevishly disposed; for this God himself\r\nknows, that I pray he may always be with thee, for he is with thee now,\r\nand will not forsake thee, and will make thee superior to thine enemies,\r\nwhether my father be one of them, or whether I myself be such. Do thou\r\nonly remember what we now do; and if it fall out that I die, preserve my\r\nchildren alive, and requite what kindness thou hast now received to\r\nthem.\" When he had thus sworn, he dismissed David, bidding him go to a\r\ncertain place of that plain wherein he used to perform his exercises;\r\nfor that, as soon as he knew the mind of his father, he would come\r\nthither to him, with one servant only; \"and if,\" says he, \"I shoot three\r\ndarts at the mark, and then bid my servant to carry these three darts\r\naway, for they are before him, know thou that there is no mischief to be\r\nfeared from my father; but if thou hearest me say the contrary, expect\r\nthe contrary from the king. However, thou shalt gain security by my\r\nmeans, and shalt by no means suffer any harm; but see thou dost not\r\nforget what I have desired of thee in the time of thy prosperity, and be\r\nserviceable to my children.\" Now David, when he had received these\r\nassurances from Jonathan, went his way to the place appointed.\r\n\r\n9. But on the next day, which was the new moon, the king, when he had\r\npurified himself, as the custom was, came to supper; and when there sat\r\nby him his son Jonathan on his right hand, and Abner, the captain of his\r\nhost, on the other hand, he saw David's seat was empty, but said\r\nnothing, supposing that he had not purified himself since he had\r\naccompanied with his wife, and so could not be present; but when he saw\r\nthat he was not there the second day of the month neither, he inquired\r\nof his son Jonathan why the son of Jesse did not come to the supper and\r\nthe feast, neither the day before nor that day. So Jonathan said, That\r\nhe was gone, according to the agreement between them, to his own city,\r\nwhere his tribe kept a festival, and that by his permission: that he\r\nalso invited him to come to their sacrifice; \"and,\" says Jonathan, \"if\r\nthou wilt give me leave, I Will go thither, for thou knowest the good-\r\nwill that I bear him.\" And then it was that Jonathan understood his\r\nfather's hatred to David, and plainly saw his entire disposition; for\r\nSaul could not restrain his anger, but reproached Jonathan, and called\r\nhim the son of a runagate, and an enemy; and said he was a partner with\r\nDavid, and his assistant, and that by his behavior he showed he had no\r\nregard to himself, or to his mother, and would not be persuaded of\r\nthis,—that while David is alive, their kingdom was not secure to them;\r\nyet did he bid him send for him, that he might be punished. And when\r\nJonathan said, in answer, \"What hath he done that thou wilt punish him?\"\r\nSaul no longer contented himself to express his anger in bare words, but\r\nsnatched up his spear, and leaped upon him, and was desirous to kill\r\nhim. He did not indeed do what he intended, because he was hindered by\r\nhis friends; but it appeared plainly to his son that he hated David, and\r\ngreatly desired to despatch him, insomuch that he had almost slain his\r\nson with his own hands on his account.\r\n\r\n10. And then it was that the king's son rose hastily from supper; and\r\nbeing unable to admit any thing into his mouth for grief, he wept all\r\nnight, both because he had himself been near destruction, and because\r\nthe death of David was determined: but as soon as it was day, he went\r\nout into the plain that was before the city, as going to perform his\r\nexercises, but in reality to inform his friend what disposition his\r\nfather was in towards him, as he had agreed with him to do; and when\r\nJonathan had done what had been thus agreed, he dismissed his servant\r\nthat followed him, to return to the city; but he himself went into the\r\ndesert, and came into his presence, and communed with him. So David\r\nappeared and fell at Jonathan's feet, and bowed down to him, and called\r\nhim the preserver of his soul; but he lifted him up from the earth, and\r\nthey mutually embraced one another, and made a long greeting, and that\r\nnot without tears. They also lamented their age, and that familiarity\r\nwhich envy would deprive them of, and that separation which must now be\r\nexpected, which seemed to them no better than death itself. So\r\nrecollecting themselves at length from their lamentation, and exhorting\r\none another to be mindful of the oaths they had sworn to each other,\r\nthey parted asunder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. How David Fled To Ahimelech And Afterwards To The Kings Of\r\nThe Philistines And Of The Moabites, And How Saul Slew Ahimelech And His\r\nFamily.\r\n\r\n1. But David fled from the king, and that death he was in danger of by\r\nhim, and came to the city Nob, to Ahimelech the priest, who, when he saw\r\nhim coming all alone, and neither a friend nor a servant with him, he\r\nwondered at it, and desired to learn of him the cause why there was\r\nnobody with him. To which David answered, That the king had commanded\r\nhim to do a certain thing that was to be kept secret, to which, if he\r\nhad a mind to know so much, he had no occasion for any one to accompany\r\nhim; \"however, I have ordered my servants to meet me at such and such a\r\nplace.\" So he desired him to let him have somewhat to eat; and that in\r\ncase he would supply him, he would act the part of a friend, and be\r\nassisting to the business he was now about: and when he had obtained\r\nwhat he desired, he also asked him whether he had any weapons with him,\r\neither sword or spear. Now there was at Nob a servant of Saul, by birth\r\na Syrian, whose name was Doeg, one that kept the king's mules. The high\r\npriest said that he had no such weapons; but, he added, \"Here is the\r\nsword of Goliath, which, when thou hadst slain the Philistine, thou\r\ndidst dedicate to God.\"\r\n\r\n2. When David had received the sword, he fled out of the country of the\r\nHebrews into that of the Philistines, over which Achish reigned; and\r\nwhen the king's servants knew him, and he was made known to the king\r\nhimself, the servants informing him that he was that David who had\r\nkilled many ten thousands of the Philistines, David was afraid lest the\r\nking should put him to death, and that he should experience that danger\r\nfrom him which he had escaped from Saul; so he pretended to be\r\ndistracted and mad, so that his spittle ran out of his mouth; and he did\r\nother the like actions before the king of Gath, which might make him\r\nbelieve that they proceeded from such a distemper. Accordingly the king\r\nwas very angry at his servants that they had brought him a madman, and\r\nhe gave orders that they should eject David immediately [out of the\r\ncity].\r\n\r\n3. So when David had escaped in this manner out of Gath, he came to the\r\ntribe of Judah, and abode in a cave by the city of Adullam. Then it was\r\nthat he sent to his brethren, and informed them where he was, who then\r\ncame to him with all their kindred, and as many others as were either in\r\nwant or in fear of king Saul, came and made a body together, and told\r\nhim they were ready to obey his orders; they were in all about four\r\nhundred. Whereupon he took courage, now such a force and assistance was\r\ncome to him; so he removed thence and came to the king of the Moabites,\r\nand desired him to entertain his parents in his country, while the issue\r\nof his affairs were in such an uncertain condition. The king granted him\r\nthis favor, and paid great respect to David's parents all the time they\r\nwere with him.\r\n\r\n4. As for himself, upon the prophet's commanding him to leave the\r\ndesert, and to go into the portion of the tribe of Judah, and abide\r\nthere, he complied therewith; and coming to the city Hareth, which was\r\nin that tribe, he remained there. Now when Saul heard that David had\r\nbeen seen with a multitude about him, he fell into no small disturbance\r\nand trouble; but as he knew that David was a bold and courageous man, he\r\nsuspected that somewhat extraordinary would appear from him, and that\r\nopenly also, which would make him weep and put him into distress; so he\r\ncalled together to him his friends, and his commanders, and the tribe\r\nfrom which he was himself derived, to the hill where his palace was; and\r\nsitting upon a place called Aroura, his courtiers that were in\r\ndignities, and the guards of his body, being with him, he spake thus to\r\nthem:—\"You that are men of my own tribe, I conclude that you remember\r\nthe benefits that I have bestowed upon you, and that I have made some of\r\nyou owners of land, and made you commanders, and bestowed posts of honor\r\nupon you, and set some of you over the common people, and others over\r\nthe soldiers; I ask you, therefore, whether you expect greater and more\r\ndonations from the son of Jesse? for I know that you are all inclinable\r\nto him; [even my own son Jonathan himself is of that opinion, and\r\npersuades you to be of the same]; for I am not unacquainted with the\r\noaths and the covenants that are between him and David, and that\r\nJonathan is a counselor and an assistant to those that conspire against\r\nme, and none of you are concerned about these things, but you keep\r\nsilence and watch, to see what will be the upshot of these things.\" When\r\nthe king had made this speech, not one of the rest of those that were\r\npresent made any answer; but Doeg the Syrian, who fed his mules, said,\r\nthat he saw David when he came to the city Nob to Ahimelech the high\r\npriest, and that he learned future events by his prophesying; that he\r\nreceived food from him, and the sword of Goliath, and was conducted by\r\nhim with security to such as he desired to go to.\r\n\r\n5. Saul therefore sent for the high priest, and for all his kindred; and\r\nsaid to them, \"What terrible or ungrateful tiring hast thou suffered\r\nfrom me, that thou hast received the son of Jesse, and hast bestowed on\r\nhim both food and weapons, when he was contriving to get the kingdom?\r\nAnd further, why didst thou deliver oracles to him concerning\r\nfuturities? For thou couldst not be unacquainted that he was fled away\r\nfrom me, and that he hated my family.\" But the high priest did not\r\nbetake himself to deny what he had done, but confessed boldly that he\r\nhad supplied him with these things, not to gratify David, but Saul\r\nhimself: and he said, \"I did not know that he was thy adversary, but a\r\nservant of thine, who was very faithful to thee, and a captain over a\r\nthousand of thy soldiers, and, what is more than these, thy son-in-law,\r\nand kinsman. Men do not choose to confer such favors on their\r\nadversaries, but on those who are esteemed to bear the highest good-will\r\nand respect to them. Nor is this the first time that I prophesied for\r\nhim, but I have done it often, and at other times as well as now. And\r\nwhen he told me that he was sent by thee in great haste to do somewhat,\r\nif I had furnished him with nothing that he desired I should have\r\nthought that it was rather in contradiction to thee than to him;\r\nwherefore do not thou entertain any ill opinion of me, nor do thou have\r\na suspicion of what I then thought an act of humanity, from what is now\r\ntold thee of David's attempts against thee, for I did then to him as to\r\nthy friend and son-in-law, and captain of a thousand, and not as to\r\nthine adversary.\"\r\n\r\n6. When the high priest had spoken thus, he did not persuade Saul, his\r\nfear was so prevalent, that he could not give credit to an apology that\r\nwas very just. So he commanded his armed men that stood about him to\r\nkill him, and all his kindred; but as they durst not touch the high\r\npriest, but were more afraid of disobeying God than the king, he ordered\r\nDoeg the Syrian to kill them. Accordingly, he took to his assistance\r\nsuch wicked men as were like himself, and slew Ahimelech and all his\r\nfamily, who were in all three hundred and eighty-five. Saul also sent to\r\nNob, 21 the city of the priests, and slew all that were there, without\r\nsparing either women or children, or any other age, and burnt it; only\r\nthere was one son of Ahimelech, whose name was Abiathar, who escaped.\r\nHowever, these things came to pass as God had foretold to Eli the high\r\npriest, when he said that his posterity should be destroyed, on account\r\nof the transgression of his two sons.\r\n\r\n7. 22 Now this king Saul, by perpetrating so barbarous a crime, and\r\nmurdering the whole family of the high-priestly dignity, by having no\r\npity of the infants, nor reverence for the aged, and by overthrowing the\r\ncity which God had chosen for the property, and for the support of the\r\npriests and prophets which were there, and had ordained as the only city\r\nallotted for the education of such men, gives all to understand and\r\nconsider the disposition of men, that while they are private persons,\r\nand in a low condition, because it is not in their power to indulge\r\nnature, nor to venture upon what they wish for, they are equitable and\r\nmoderate, and pursue nothing but what is just, and bend their whole\r\nminds and labors that way; then it is that they have this belief about\r\nGod, that he is present to all the actions of their lives, and that he\r\ndoes not only see the actions that are done, but clearly knows those\r\ntheir thoughts also, whence those actions do arise. But when once they\r\nare advanced into power and authority, then they put off all such\r\nnotions, and, as if they were no other than actors upon a theater, they\r\nlay aside their disguised parts and manners, and take up boldness,\r\ninsolence, and a contempt of both human and Divine laws, and this at a\r\ntime when they especially stand in need of piety and righteousness,\r\nbecause they are then most of all exposed to envy, and all they think,\r\nand all they say, are in the view of all men; then it is that they\r\nbecome so insolent in their actions, as though God saw them no longer,\r\nor were afraid of them because of their power: and whatsoever it is that\r\nthey either are afraid of by the rumors they hear, or they hate by\r\ninclination, or they love without reason, these seem to them to be\r\nauthentic, and firm, and true, and pleasing both to men and to God; but\r\nas to what will come hereafter, they have not the least regard to it.\r\nThey raise those to honor indeed who have been at a great deal of pains\r\nfor them, and after that honor they envy them; and when they have\r\nbrought them into high dignity, they do not only deprive them of what\r\nthey had obtained, but also, on that very account, of their lives also,\r\nand that on wicked accusations, and such as on account of their\r\nextravagant nature, are incredible. They also punish men for their\r\nactions, not such as deserve condemnation, but from calumnies and\r\naccusations without examination; and this extends not only to such as\r\ndeserve to be punished, but to as many as they are able to kill. This\r\nreflection is openly confirmed to us from the example of Saul, the son\r\nof Kish, who was the first king who reigned after our aristocracy and\r\ngovernment under the judges were over; and that by his slaughter of\r\nthree hundred priests and prophets, on occasion of his suspicion about\r\nAhimelech, and by the additional wickedness of the overthrow of their\r\ncity, and this is as he were endeavoring in some sort to render the\r\ntemple [tabernacle] destitute both of priests and prophets, which\r\nendeavor he showed by slaying so many of them, and not suffering the\r\nvery city belonging to them to remain, that so others might succeed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n8. But Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, who alone could be saved out of\r\nthe family of priests slain by Saul, fled to David, and informed him of\r\nthe calamity that had befallen their family, and of the slaughter of his\r\nfather; who hereupon said, He was not unapprised of what would follow\r\nwith relation to them when he saw Doeg there; for he had then a\r\nsuspicion that the high priest would be falsely accused by him to the\r\nking, and he blamed himself as having been the cause of this misfortune.\r\nBut he desired him to stay there, and abide with him, as in a place\r\nwhere he might be better concealed than any where else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. How David, When He Had Twice The Opportunity Of Killing Saul\r\nDid Not Kill Him. Also Concerning The Death Of Samuel And Nabal.\r\n\r\n1. About this time it was that David heard how the Philistines had made\r\nan inroad into the country of Keilah, and robbed it; so he offered\r\nhimself to fight against them, if God, when he should be consulted by\r\nthe prophet, would grant him the victory. And when the prophet said that\r\nGod gave a signal of victory, he made a sudden onset upon the\r\nPhilistines with his companions, and he shed a great deal of their\r\nblood, and carried off their prey, and staid with the inhabitants of\r\nKeilah till they had securely gathered in their corn and their fruits.\r\nHowever, it was told Saul the king that David was with the men of\r\nKeilah; for what had been done and the great success that had attended\r\nhim, were not confined among the people where the things were done, but\r\nthe fame of it went all abroad, and came to the hearing of others, and\r\nboth the fact as it stood, and the author of the fact, were carried to\r\nthe king's ears. Then was Saul glad when he heard David was in Keilah;\r\nand he said, \"God hath now put him into my hands, since he hath obliged\r\nhim to come into a city that hath walls, and gates, and bars.\" So he\r\ncommanded all the people suddenly, and when they had besieged and taken\r\nit to kill David. But when David perceived this, and learned of God that\r\nif he staid there the men of Keilah would deliver him up to Saul, he\r\ntook his four hundred men and retired into a desert that was over\r\nagainst a city called Engedi. So that when the king heard he was fled\r\naway from the men of Keilah, he left off his expedition against him.\r\n\r\n2. Then David removed thence, and came to a certain place called the New\r\nPlace, belonging to Ziph; where Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to him,\r\nand saluted him, and exhorted him to be of good courage, and to hope\r\nwell as to his condition hereafter, and not to despond at his present\r\ncircumstances, for that he should be king, and have all the forces of\r\nthe Hebrews under him: he told him that such happiness uses to come with\r\ngreat labor and pains: they also took oaths, that they would, all their\r\nlives long, continue in good-will and fidelity one to another; and he\r\ncalled God to witness, as to what execrations he had made upon himself\r\nif he should transgress his covenant, and should change to a contrary\r\nbehavior. So Jonathan left him there, having rendered his cares and\r\nfears somewhat lighter, and returned home. Now the men of Ziph, to\r\ngratify Saul, informed him that David abode with them, and [assured him]\r\nthat if he would come to them, they would deliver him up, for that if\r\nthe king would seize on the Straits of Ziph, David would not escape to\r\nany other people. So the king commended them, and confessed that he had\r\nreason to thank them, because they had given him information of his\r\nenemy; and he promised them, that it should not be long ere he would\r\nrequite their kindness. He also sent men to seek for David, and to\r\nsearch the wilderness wherein he was; and he promised that he himself\r\nwould follow them. Accordingly they went before the king, to hunt for\r\nand to catch David, and used endeavors, not only to show their good-will\r\nto Saul, by informing him where his enemy was, but to evidence the same\r\nmore plainly by delivering him up into his power. But these men failed\r\nof those their unjust and wicked desires, who, while they underwent no\r\nhazard by not discovering such an ambition of revealing this to Saul,\r\nyet did they falsely accuse and promise to deliver up a man beloved of\r\nGod, and one that was unjustly sought after to be put to death, and one\r\nthat might otherwise have lain concealed, and this out of flattery, and\r\nexpectation of gain from the king; for when David was apprized of the\r\nmalignant intentions of the men of Ziph, and the approach of Saul, he\r\nleft the Straits of that country, and fled to the great rock that was in\r\nthe wilderness of Maon.\r\n\r\n3. Hereupon Saul made haste to pursue him thither; for, as he was\r\nmarching, he learned that David was gone away from the Straits of Ziph,\r\nand Saul removed to the other side of the rock. But the report that the\r\nPhilistines had again made an incursion into the country of the Hebrews,\r\ncalled Saul another way from the pursuit of David, when he was ready to\r\nbe caught; for he returned back again to oppose those Philistines, who\r\nwere naturally their enemies, as judging it more necessary to avenge\r\nhimself of them, than to take a great deal of pains to catch an enemy of\r\nhis own, and to overlook the ravage that was made in the land.\r\n\r\n4. And by this means David unexpectedly escaped out of the danger he was\r\nin, and came to the Straits of Engedi; and when Saul had driven the\r\nPhilistines out of the land, there came some messengers, who told him\r\nthat David abode within the bounds of Engedi: so he took three thousand\r\nchosen men that were armed, and made haste to him; and when he was not\r\nfar from those places, he saw a deep and hollow cave by the way-side; it\r\nwas open to a great length and breadth, and there it was that David with\r\nhis four hundred men were concealed. When therefore he had occasion to\r\nease nature, he entered into it by himself alone; and being seen by one\r\nof David's companions, and he that saw him saying to him, that he had\r\nnow, by God's providence, an opportunity of avenging himself of his\r\nadversary; and advising him to cut off his head, and so deliver himself\r\nout of that tedious, wandering condition, and the distress he was in; he\r\nrose up, and only cut off the skirt of that garment which Saul had on:\r\nbut he soon repented of what he had done; and said it was not right to\r\nkill him that was his master, and one whom God had thought worthy of the\r\nkingdom; \"for that although he were wickedly disposed towards us, yet\r\ndoes it not behoove me to be so disposed towards him.\" But when Saul had\r\nleft the cave, David came near and cried out aloud, and desired Saul to\r\nhear him; whereupon the king turned his face back, and David, according\r\nto custom, fell down on his face before the king, and bowed to him; and\r\nsaid, \"O king, thou oughtest not to hearken to wicked men, nor to such\r\nas forge calumnies, nor to gratify them so far as to believe what they\r\nsay, nor to entertain suspicions of such as are your best friends, but\r\nto judge of the dispositions of all men by their actions; for calumny\r\ndeludes men, but men's own actions are a clear demonstration of their\r\nkindness. Words indeed, in their own nature, may be either true or\r\nfalse, but men's actions expose their intentions nakedly to our view. By\r\nthese, therefore it will be well for thee to believe me, as to my regard\r\nto thee and to thy house, and not to believe those that frame such\r\naccusations against me as never came into my mind, nor are possible to\r\nbe executed, and do this further by pursuing after my life, and have no\r\nconcern either day or night, but how to compass my life and to murder\r\nme, which thing I think thou dost unjustly prosecute; for how comes it\r\nabout, that thou hast embraced this false opinion about me, as if I had\r\na desire to kill thee? Or how canst thou escape the crime of impiety\r\ntowards God, when thou wishest thou couldst kill, and deemest thine\r\nadversary, a man who had it in his power this day to avenge himself, and\r\nto punish thee, but would not do it? nor make use of such an\r\nopportunity, which, if it had fallen out to thee against me, thou hadst\r\nnot let it slip, for when I cut off the skirt of thy garment, I could\r\nhave done the same to thy head.\" So he showed him the piece of his\r\ngarment, and thereby made him agree to what he said to be true; and\r\nadded, \"I, for certain, have abstained from taking a just revenge upon\r\nthee, yet art thou not ashamed to prosecute me with unjust hatred. 23\r\nMay God do justice, and determine about each of our dispositions.\"—But\r\nSaul was amazed at the strange delivery he had received; and being\r\ngreatly affected with the moderation and the disposition of the young\r\nman, he groaned; and when David had done the same, the king answered\r\nthat he had the justest occasion to groan, \"for thou hast been the\r\nauthor of good to me, as I have been the author of calamity to thee; and\r\nthou hast demonstrated this day, that thou possessest the righteousness\r\nof the ancients, who determined that men ought to save their enemies,\r\nthough they caught them in a desert place. I am now persuaded that God\r\nreserves the kingdom for thee, and that thou wilt obtain the dominion\r\nover all the Hebrews. Give me then assurances upon oath, That thou wilt\r\nnot root out my family, nor, out of remembrance of what evil I have done\r\nthee, destroy my posterity, but save and preserve my house.\" So David\r\nsware as he desired, and sent back Saul to his own kingdom; but he, and\r\nthose that were with him, went up the Straits of Mastheroth.\r\n\r\n5. About this time Samuel the prophet died. He was a man whom the\r\nHebrews honored in an extraordinary degree: for that lamentation which\r\nthe people made for him, and this during a long time, manifested his\r\nvirtue, and the affection which the people bore for him; as also did the\r\nsolemnity and concern that appeared about his funeral, and about the\r\ncomplete observation of all his funeral rites. They buried him in his\r\nown city of Ramah; and wept for him a very great number of days, not\r\nlooking on it as a sorrow for the death of another man, but as that in\r\nwhich they were every one themselves concerned. He was a righteous man,\r\nand gentle in his nature; and on that account he was very dear to God.\r\nNow he governed and presided over the people alone, after the death of\r\nEli the high priest, twelve years, and eighteen years together with Saul\r\nthe king. And thus we have finished the history of Samuel.\r\n\r\n6. There was a man that was a Ziphite, of the city of Maon, who was\r\nrich, and had a vast number of cattle; for he fed a flock of three\r\nthousand sheep, and another flock of a thousand goats. Now David had\r\ncharged his associates to keep these flocks without hurt and without\r\ndamage, and to do them no mischief, neither out of covetousness, nor\r\nbecause they were in want, nor because they were in the wilderness, and\r\nso could not easily be discovered, but to esteem freedom from injustice\r\nabove all other motives, and to look upon the touching of what belonged\r\nto another man as a horrible crime, and contrary to the will of God.\r\nThese were the instructions he gave, thinking that the favors he granted\r\nthis man were granted to a good man, and one that deserved to have such\r\ncare taken of his affairs. This man was Nabal, for that was his name,—a\r\nharsh man, and of a very wicked life, being like a cynic in the course\r\nof his behavior, but still had obtained for his wife a woman of a good\r\ncharacter, wise and handsome. To this Nabal, therefore, David sent ten\r\nmen of his attendants at the time when he sheared his sheep, and by them\r\nsaluted him; and also wished he might do what he now did for many years\r\nto come, but desired him to make him a present of what he was able to\r\ngive him, since he had, to be sure, learned from his shepherds that we\r\nhad done them no injury, but had been their guardians a long time\r\ntogether, while we continued in the wilderness; and he assured him he\r\nshould never repent of giving any thing to David. When the messengers\r\nhad carried this message to Nabal, he accosted them after an inhuman and\r\nrough manner; for he asked them who David was? and when he heard that he\r\nwas the son of Jesse, he said, \"Now is the time that fugitives grow\r\ninsolent, and make a figure, and leave their masters.\" When they told\r\nDavid this, he was wroth, and commanded four hundred armed men to follow\r\nhim, and left two hundred to take care of the stuff, [for he had already\r\nsix hundred, 24] and went against Nabal: he also swore that he would\r\nthat night utterly destroy the whole house and possessions of Nabal; for\r\nthat he was grieved, not only that he had proved ungrateful to them,\r\nwithout making any return for the humanity they had shown him, but that\r\nhe had also reproached them, and used ill language to them, when he had\r\nreceived no cause of disgust from them.\r\n\r\n7. Hereupon one of those that kept the flocks of Nabal, said to his\r\nmistress, Nabal's wife, that when David sent to her husband he had\r\nreceived no civil answer at all from him; but that her husband had\r\nmoreover added very reproachful language, while yet David had taken\r\nextraordinary care to keep his flocks from harm, and that what had\r\npassed would prove very pernicious to his master. When the servant had\r\nsaid this, Abigail, for that was his wife's name, saddled her asses, and\r\nloaded them with all sorts of presents; and, without telling her husband\r\nany thing of what she was about, [for he was not sensible on account of\r\nhis drunkenness,] she went to David. She was then met by David as she\r\nwas descending a hill, who was coming against Nabal with four hundred\r\nmen. When the woman saw David, she leaped down from her ass, and fell on\r\nher face, and bowed down to the ground; and entreated him not to bear in\r\nmind the words of Nabal, since he knew that he resembled his name. Now\r\nNabal, in the Hebrew tongue, signifies folly. So she made her apology,\r\nthat she did not see the messengers whom he sent. \"Forgive me,\r\ntherefore,\" said she, \"and thank God, who hath hindered thee from\r\nshedding human blood; for so long as thou keepest thyself innocent, he\r\nwill avenge thee of wicked men, 25 for what miseries await Nabal, they\r\nwill fall upon the heads of thine enemies. Be thou gracious to me, and\r\nthink me so far worthy as to accept of these presents from me; and, out\r\nof regard to me, remit that wrath and that anger which thou hast against\r\nmy husband and his house, for mildness and humanity become thee,\r\nespecially as thou art to be our king.\" Accordingly, David accepted her\r\npresents, and said, \"Nay, but, O woman, it was no other than God's mercy\r\nwhich brought thee to us today, for, otherwise, thou hadst never seen\r\nanother day, I having sworn to destroy Nabal's house this very night,\r\nand to leave alive not one of you who belonged to a man that was wicked\r\nand ungrateful to me and my companions; but now hast thou prevented me,\r\nand seasonably mollified my anger, as being thyself under the care of\r\nGod's providence: but as for Nabal, although for thy sake he now escape\r\npunishment, he will not always avoid justice; for his evil conduct, on\r\nsome other occasion, will be his ruin.\" 26\r\n\r\n8. When David had said this, he dismissed the woman. But when she came\r\nhome and found her husband feasting with a great company, and oppressed\r\nwith wine, she said nothing to him then about what had happened; but on\r\nthe next day, when he was sober, she told him all the particulars, and\r\nmade his whole body to appear like that of a dead man by her words, and\r\nby that grief which arose from them; so Nabal survived ten days, and no\r\nmore, and then died. And when David heard of his death, he said that God\r\nhad justly avenged him of this man, for that Nabal had died by his own\r\nwickedness, and had suffered punishment on his account, while he had\r\nkept his own hands clean. At which time he understood that the wicked\r\nare prosecuted by God; that he does not overlook any man, but bestows on\r\nthe good what is suitable to them, and inflicts a deserved punishment on\r\nthe wicked. So he sent to Nabal's wife, and invited her to come to him,\r\nto live with him, and to be his wife. Whereupon she replied to those\r\nthat came, that she was not worthy to touch his feet; however, she came,\r\nwith all her servants, and became his wife, having received that honor\r\non account of her wise and righteous course of life. She also obtained\r\nthe same honor partly on account of her beauty. Now David had a wife\r\nbefore, whom he married from the city Abesar; for as to Michal, the\r\ndaughter of king Saul, who had been David's wife, her father had given\r\nher in marriage to Phalti, the son of Laish, who was of the city of\r\nGallim.\r\n\r\n9. After this came certain of the Ziphites, and told Saul that David was\r\ncome again into their country, and if he would afford them his\r\nassistance, they could catch him. So he came to them with three thousand\r\narmed men; and upon the approach of night, he pitched his camp at a\r\ncertain place called Hachilah. But when David heard that Saul was coming\r\nagainst him, he sent spies, and bid them let him know to what place of\r\nthe country Saul was already come; and when they told him that he was at\r\nHachilah, he concealed his going away from his companions, and came to\r\nSaul's camp, having taken with him Abishai, his sister Zeruiah's son,\r\nand Ahimelech the Hittite. Now Saul was asleep, and the armed men, with\r\nAbner their commander, lay round about him in a circle. Hereupon David\r\nentered into the king's tent; but he did neither kill Saul, though he\r\nknew where he lay, by the spear that was stuck down by him, nor did he\r\ngive leave to Abishai, who would have killed him, and was earnestly bent\r\nupon it so to do; for he said it was a horrid crime to kill one that was\r\nordained king by God, although he was a wicked man; for that he who gave\r\nhim the dominion would in time inflict punishment upon him. So he\r\nrestrained his eagerness; but that it might appear to have been in his\r\npower to have killed him when he refrained from it, he took his spear,\r\nand the cruse of water which stood by Saul as he lay asleep, without\r\nbeing perceived by any in the camp, who were all asleep, and went\r\nsecurely away, having performed every thing among the king's attendants\r\nthat the opportunity afforded, and his boldness encouraged him to do. So\r\nwhen he had passed over a brook, and was gotten up to the top of a hill,\r\nwhence he might be sufficiently heard, he cried aloud to Saul's\r\nsoldiers, and to Abner their commander, and awaked them out of their\r\nsleep, and called both to him and to the people. Hereupon the commander\r\nheard him, and asked who it was that called him. To whom David replied,\r\n\"It is I, the son of Jesse, whom you make a vagabond. But what is the\r\nmatter? Dost thou, that art a man of so great dignity, and of the first\r\nrank in the king's court, take so little care of thy master's body? and\r\nis sleep of more consequence to thee than his preservation, and thy care\r\nof him? This negligence of yours deserves death, and punishment to be\r\ninflicted on you, who never perceived when, a little while ago, some of\r\nus entered into your camp, nay, as far as to the king himself, and to\r\nall the rest of you. If thou look for the king's spear and his cruse of\r\nwater, thou wilt learn what a mighty misfortune was ready to overtake\r\nyou in your very camp without your knowing it.\" Now when Saul knew\r\nDavid's voice, and understood that when he had him in his power while he\r\nwas asleep, and his guards took no care of him, yet did not he kill him,\r\nbut spared him, when he might justly have cut him off, he said that he\r\nowed him thanks for his preservation; and exhorted him to be of good\r\ncourage, and not be afraid of suffering any mischief from him any more,\r\nand to return to his own home, for he was now persuaded that he did not\r\nlove himself so well as he was loved by him: that he had driven away him\r\nthat could guard him, and had given many demonstrations of his good-will\r\nto him: that he had forced him to live so long in a state of banishment,\r\nand in great fears of his life, destitute of his friends and his\r\nkindred, while still he was often saved by him, and frequently received\r\nhis life again when it was evidently in danger of perishing. So David\r\nbade them send for the spear and the cruse of water, and take them back;\r\nadding this withal, That God would be the judge of both their\r\ndispositions, and of the actions that flowed from the same, \"who knows\r\nthat then it was this day in my power to have killed thee I abstained\r\nfrom it.\"\r\n\r\n10. Thus Saul having escaped the hands of David twice, he went his way\r\nto his royal palace, and his own city: but David was afraid, that if he\r\nstaid there he should be caught by Saul; so he thought it better to go\r\nup into the land of the Philistines, and abide there. Accordingly, he\r\ncame with the six hundred men that were with him to Achish, the king of\r\nGath, which was one of their five cities. Now the king received both him\r\nand his men, and gave them a place to inhabit in. He had with him also\r\nhis two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, and he dwelt in Gath. But when Saul\r\nheard this, he took no further care about sending to him, or going after\r\nhim, because he had been twice, in a manner, caught by him, while he was\r\nhimself endeavoring to catch him. However, David had no mind to continue\r\nin the city of Gath, but desired the king, that since he had received\r\nhim with such humanity, that he would grant him another favor, and\r\nbestow upon him some place of that country for his habitation, for he\r\nwas ashamed, by living in the city, to be grievous and burdensome to\r\nhim. So Achish gave him a certain village called Ziklag; which place\r\nDavid and his sons were fond of when he was king, and reckoned it to be\r\ntheir peculiar inheritance. But about those matters we shall give the\r\nreader further information elsewhere. Now the time that David dwelt in\r\nZiklag, in the land of the Philistines, was four months and twenty days.\r\nAnd now he privately attacked those Geshurites and Amalekites that were\r\nneighbors to the Philistines, and laid waste their country, and took\r\nmuch prey of their beasts and camels, and then returned home; but David\r\nabstained from the men, as fearing they should discover him to king\r\nAchish; yet did he send part of the prey to him as a free gift. And when\r\nthe king inquired whom they had attacked when they brought away the\r\nprey, he said, those that lay to the south of the Jews, and inhabited in\r\nthe plain; whereby he persuaded Achish to approve of what he had done,\r\nfor he hoped that David had fought against his own nation, and that now\r\nhe should have him for his servant all his life long, and that he would\r\nstay in his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. How Saul Upon God's Not Answering Him Concerning The Fight\r\nWith The Philistines Desired A Necromantic Woman To Raise Up The Soul Of\r\nSamuel To Him; And How He Died, With His Sons Upon The Overthrow Of The\r\nHebrews In Battle.\r\n\r\n1. About the same time the Philistines resolved to make war against the\r\nIsraelites, and sent to all their confederates that they would go along\r\nwith them to the war to Reggan, [near the city Shunem,] whence they\r\nmight gather themselves together, and suddenly attack the Hebrews. Then\r\ndid Achish, the king of Gath, desire David to assist them with his armed\r\nmen against the Hebrews. This he readily promised; and said that the\r\ntime was now come wherein he might requite him for his kindness and\r\nhospitality. So the king promised to make him the keeper of his body,\r\nafter the victory, supposing that the battle with the enemy succeeded to\r\ntheir mind; which promise of honor and confidence he made on purpose to\r\nincrease his zeal for his service.\r\n\r\n2. Now Saul, the king of the Hebrews, had cast out of the country the\r\nfortune-tellers, and the necromancers, and all such as exercised the\r\nlike arts, excepting the prophets. But when he heard that the\r\nPhilistines were already come, and had pitched their camp near the city\r\nShunem, situate in the plain, he made haste to oppose them with his\r\nforces; and when he was come to a certain mountain called Gilboa, he\r\npitched his camp over-against the enemy; but when he saw the enemy's\r\narmy he was greatly troubled, because it appeared to him to be numerous,\r\nand superior to his own; and he inquired of God by the prophets\r\nconcerning the battle, that he might know beforehand what would be the\r\nevent of it. And when God did not answer him, Saul was under a still\r\ngreater dread, and his courage fell, foreseeing, as was but reasonable\r\nto suppose, that mischief would befall him, now God was not there to\r\nassist him; yet did he bid his servants to inquire out for him some\r\nwoman that was a necromancer and called up the souls of the dead, that\r\nSo he might know whether his affairs would succeed to his mind; for this\r\nsort of necromantic women that bring up the souls of the dead, do by\r\nthem foretell future events to such as desire them. And one of his\r\nservants told him that there was such a woman in the city Endor, but was\r\nknown to nobody in the camp; hereupon Saul put off his royal apparel,\r\nand took two of those his servants with him, whom he knew to be most\r\nfaithful to him, and came to Endor to the woman, and entreated her to\r\nact the part of a fortune-teller, and to bring up such a soul to him as\r\nhe should name to her. But when the woman opposed his motion, and said\r\nshe did not despise the king, who had banished this sort of fortune-\r\ntellers, and that he did not do well himself, when she had done him no\r\nharm, to endeavor to lay a snare for her, and to discover that she\r\nexercised a forbidden art, in order to procure her to be punished, he\r\nsware that nobody should know what she did; and that he would not tell\r\nany one else what she foretold, but that she should incur no danger. As\r\nsoon as he had induced her by this oath to fear no harm, he bid her\r\nbring up to him the soul of Samuel. She, not knowing who Samuel was,\r\ncalled him out of Hades. When he appeared, and the woman saw one that\r\nwas venerable, and of a divine form, she was in disorder; and being\r\nastonished at the sight, she said, \"Art not thou king Saul?\" for Samuel\r\nhad informed her who he was. When he had owned that to be true, and had\r\nasked her whence her disorder arose, she said that she saw a certain\r\nperson ascend, who in his form was like to a god. And when he bid her\r\ntell him what he resembled, in what habit he appeared, and of what age\r\nhe was, she told him he was an old man already, and of a glorious\r\npersonage, and had on a sacerdotal mantle. So the king discovered by\r\nthese signs that he was Samuel; and he fell down upon the ground, and\r\nsaluted and worshipped him. And when the soul of Samuel asked him why he\r\nhad disturbed him, and caused him to be brought up, he lamented the\r\nnecessity he was under; for he said, that his enemies pressed heavily\r\nupon him; that he was in distress what to do in his present\r\ncircumstances; that he was forsaken of God, and could obtain no\r\nprediction of what was coming, neither by prophets nor by dreams; and\r\nthat \"these were the reasons why I have recourse to time, who always\r\ntook great care of me.\" But 27 Samuel, seeing that the end of Saul's\r\nlife was come, said, \"It is in vain for thee to desire to learn of me\r\nany thing future, when God hath forsaken thee: however, hear what I say,\r\nthat David is to be king, and to finish this war with good success; and\r\nthou art to lose thy dominion and thy life, because thou didst not obey\r\nGod in the war with the Amalekites, and hast not kept his commandments,\r\nas I foretold thee while I was alive. Know, therefore, that the people\r\nshall be made subject to their enemies, and that thou, with thy sons,\r\nshall fall in the battle tomorrow, and thou shalt then be with me [in\r\nHades].\"\r\n\r\n3. When Saul heard this, he could not speak for grief, and fell down on\r\nthe floor, whether it were from the sorrow that arose upon what Samuel\r\nhad said, or from his emptiness, for he had taken no food the foregoing\r\nday nor night, he easily fell quite down: and when with difficulty he\r\nhad recovered himself, the woman would force him to eat, begging this of\r\nhim as a favor on account of her concern in that dangerous instance of\r\nfortune-telling, which it was not lawful for her to have done, because\r\nof the fear she was under of the king, while she knew not who he was,\r\nyet did she undertake it, and go through with it; on which account she\r\nentreated him to admit that a table and food might be set before him,\r\nthat he might recover his strength, and so get safe to his own camp. And\r\nwhen he opposed her motion, and entirely rejected it, by reason of his\r\nanxiety, she forced him, and at last persuaded him to it. Now she had\r\none calf that she was very fond of, and one that she took a great deal\r\nof care of, and fed it herself; for she was a woman that got her living\r\nby the labor of her own hands, and had no other possession but that one\r\ncalf; this she killed, and made ready its flesh, and set it before his\r\nservants and himself. So Saul came to the camp while it was yet night.\r\n\r\n4. Now it is but just to recommend the generosity of this woman, 28\r\nbecause when the king had forbidden her to use that art whence her\r\ncircumstances were bettered and improved, and when she had never seen\r\nthe king before, she still did not remember to his disadvantage that he\r\nhad condemned her sort of learning, and did not refuse him as a\r\nstranger, and one that she had had no acquaintance with; but she had\r\ncompassion upon him, and comforted him, and exhorted him to do what he\r\nwas greatly averse to, and offered him the only creature she had, as a\r\npoor woman, and that earnestly, and with great humanity, while she had\r\nno requital made her for her kindness, nor hunted after any future favor\r\nfrom him, for she knew he was to die; whereas men are naturally either\r\nambitious to please those that bestow benefits upon them, or are very\r\nready to serve those from whom they may receive some advantage. It would\r\nbe well therefore to imitate the example and to do kindnesses to all\r\nsuch as are in want and to think that nothing is better, nor more\r\nbecoming mankind, than such a general beneficence, nor what will sooner\r\nrender God favorable, and ready to bestow good things upon us. And so\r\nfar may suffice to have spoken concerning this woman. But I shall speak\r\nfurther upon another subject, which will afford me all opportunity of\r\ndiscoursing on what is for the advantage of cities, and people, and\r\nnations, and suited to the taste of good men, and will encourage them\r\nall in the prosecution of virtue; and is capable of showing them the\r\ndesirability of acquiring glory, and an everlasting fame; and of\r\nimprinting in the kings of nations, and the rulers of cities, great\r\ninclination and diligence of doing well; as also of encouraging them to\r\nundergo dangers, and to die for their countries, and of instructing them\r\nhow to despise all the most terrible adversities: and I have a fair\r\noccasion offered me to enter on such a discourse by Saul the king of the\r\nHebrews; for although he knew what was coming upon him, and that he was\r\nto die immediately, by the prediction of the prophet, he did not resolve\r\nto fly from death, nor so far to indulge the love of life as to betray\r\nhis own people to the enemy, or to bring a disgrace on his royal\r\ndignity; but exposing himself, as well as all his family and children,\r\nto dangers, he thought it a brave thing to fall together with them, as\r\nhe was fighting for his subjects, and that it was better his sons should\r\ndie thus, showing their courage, than to leave them to their uncertain\r\nconduct afterward, while, instead of succession and posterity, they\r\ngained commendation and a lasting name. Such a one alone seems to me to\r\nbe a just, a courageous, and a prudent man; and when any one has arrived\r\nat these dispositions, or shall hereafter arrive at them, he is the man\r\nthat ought to be by all honored with the testimony of a virtuous or\r\ncourageous man: for as to those that go out to war with hopes of\r\nsuccess, and that they shall return safe, supposing they should have\r\nperformed some glorious action, I think those do not do well who call\r\nthese valiant men, as so many historians and other writers who treat of\r\nthem are wont to do, although I confess those do justly deserve some\r\ncommendation also; but those only may be styled courageous and bold in\r\ngreat undertakings, and despisers of adversities, who imitate Saul: for\r\nas for those that do not know what the event of war will be as to\r\nthemselves, and though they do not faint in it, but deliver themselves\r\nup to uncertain futurity, and are tossed this way and that way, this is\r\nnot so very eminent an instance of a generous mind, although they happen\r\nto perform many great exploits; but when men's minds expect no good\r\nevent, but they know beforehand they must die, and that they must\r\nundergo that death in the battle also, after this neither to be\r\naffrighted, nor to be astonished at the terrible fate that is coming,\r\nbut to go directly upon it, when they know it beforehand, this it is\r\nthat I esteem the character of a man truly courageous. Accordingly this\r\nSaul did, and thereby demonstrated that all men who desire fame after\r\nthey are dead are so to act as they may obtain the same: this especially\r\nconcerns kings, who ought not to think it enough in their high stations\r\nthat they are not wicked in the government of their subjects, but to be\r\nno more than moderately good to them. I could say more than this about\r\nSaul and his courage, the subject affording matter sufficient; but that\r\nI may not appear to run out improperly in his commendation, I return\r\nagain to that history from which I made this digression.\r\n\r\n5. Now when the Philistines, as I said before, had pitched their camp,\r\nand had taken an account of their forces, according to their nations,\r\nand kingdoms, and governments, king Achish came last of all with his own\r\narmy; after whom came David with his six hundred armed men. And when the\r\ncommanders of the Philistines saw him, they asked the king whence these\r\nHebrews came, and at whose invitation. He answered that it was David,\r\nwho was fled away from his master Saul, and that he had entertained him\r\nwhen he came to him, and that now he was willing to make him this\r\nrequital for his favors, and to avenge himself upon Saul, and so was\r\nbecome his confederate. The commanders complained of this, that he had\r\ntaken him for a confederate who was an enemy; and gave him counsel to\r\nsend him away, lest he should unawares do his friends a great deal of\r\nmischief by entertaining him, for that he afforded him an opportunity of\r\nbeing reconciled to his master by doing a mischief to our army. They\r\nthereupon desired him, out of a prudent foresight of this, to send him\r\naway, with his six hundred armed men, to the place he had given him for\r\nhis habitation; for that this was that David whom the virgins celebrated\r\nin their hymns, as having destroyed many ten thousands of the\r\nPhilistines. When the king of Gath heard this, he thought they spake\r\nwell; so he called David, and said to him, \"As for myself, I can bear\r\nwitness that thou hast shown great diligence and kindness about me, and\r\non that account it was that I took thee for my confederate; however,\r\nwhat I have done does not please the commanders of the Philistines; go\r\ntherefore within a day's time to the place I have given thee, without\r\nsuspecting any harm, and there keep my country, lest any of our enemies\r\nshould make an incursion upon it, which will be one part of that\r\nassistance which I expect from thee.\" So David came to Ziklag, as the\r\nking of Gath bade him; but it happened, that while he was gone to the\r\nassistance of the Philistines, the Amalekites had made an incursion, and\r\ntaken Ziklag before, and had burnt it; and when they had taken a great\r\ndeal of other prey out of that place, and out of the other parts of the\r\nPhilistines' country, they departed.\r\n\r\n6. Now when David found that Ziklag was laid waste, and that it was all\r\nspoiled, and that as well his own wives, who were two, as the wives of\r\nhis companions, with their children, were made captives, he presently\r\nrent his clothes, weeping and lamenting, together with his friends; and\r\nindeed he was so cast down with these misfortunes, that at length tears\r\nthemselves failed him. He was also in danger of being stoned to death by\r\nhis companions, who were greatly afflicted at the captivity of their\r\nwives and children, for they laid the blame upon him of what had\r\nhappened. But when he had recovered himself out of his grief, and had\r\nraised up his mind to God, he desired the high priest Abiathar to put on\r\nhis sacerdotal garments, and to inquire of God, and to prophesy to him,\r\nwhether God would grant; that if he pursued after the Amalekites, he\r\nshould overtake them, and save their wives and their children, and\r\navenge himself on the enemies. And when the high priest bade him to\r\npursue after them, he marched apace, with his four hundred men, after\r\nthe enemy; and when he was come to a certain brook called Besor, and had\r\nlighted upon one that was wandering about, an Egyptian by birth, who was\r\nalmost dead with want and famine, [for he had continued wandering about\r\nwithout food in the wilderness three days,] he first of all gave him\r\nsustenance, both meat and drink, and thereby refreshed him. He then\r\nasked him to whom he belonged, and whence he came. Whereupon the man\r\ntold him he was an Egyptian by birth, and was left behind by his master,\r\nbecause he was so sick and weak that he could not follow him. He also\r\ninformed him that he was one of those who had burnt and plundered, not\r\nonly other parts of Judea, but Ziklag itself also. So David made use of\r\nhim as a guide to find oat the Amalekites; and when he had overtaken\r\nthem, as they lay scattered about on the ground, some at dinner, some\r\ndisordered, and entirely drunk with wine, and in the fruition of their\r\nspoils and their prey, he fell upon them on the sudden, and made a great\r\nslaughter among them; for they were naked, and expected no such thing,\r\nbut had betaken themselves to drinking and feasting; and so they were\r\nall easily destroyed. Now some of them that were overtaken as they lay\r\nat the table were slain in that posture, and their blood brought up with\r\nit their meat and their drink. They slew others of them as they were\r\ndrinking to one another in their cups, and some of them when their full\r\nbellies had made them fall asleep; and for so many as had time to put on\r\ntheir armor, they slew them with the sword, with no less ease than they\r\ndid those that were naked; and for the partisans of David, they\r\ncontinued also the slaughter from the first hour of the day to the\r\nevening, so that there were, not above four hundred of the Amalekites\r\nleft; and they only escaped by getting upon their dromedaries and\r\ncamels. Accordingly David recovered not only all the other spoils which\r\nthe enemy had carried away, but his wives also, and the wives of his\r\ncompanions. But when they were come to the place where they had left the\r\ntwo hundred men, which were not able to follow them, but were left to\r\ntake care of the stuff, the four hundred men did not think fit to divide\r\namong them any other parts of what they had gotten, or of the prey,\r\nsince they did not accompany them, but pretended to be feeble, and did\r\nnot follow them in pursuit of the enemy, but said they should be\r\ncontented to have safely recovered their wives; yet did David pronounce\r\nthat this opinion of theirs was evil and unjust, and that when God had\r\ngranted them such a favor, that they had avenged themselves on their\r\nenemies, and had recovered all that belonged to themselves, they should\r\nmake an equal distribution of what they had gotten to all, because the\r\nrest had tarried behind to guard their stuff; and from that time this\r\nlaw obtained among them, that those who guarded the stuff, should\r\nreceive an equal share with those that fought in the battle. Now when\r\nDavid was come to Ziklag, he sent portions of the spoils to all that had\r\nbeen familiar with him, and to his friends in the tribe of Judah. And\r\nthus ended the affairs of the plundering of Ziklag, and of the slaughter\r\nof the Amalekites.\r\n\r\n7. Now upon the Philistines joining battle, there followed a sharp\r\nengagement, and the Philistine, became the conquerors, and slew a great\r\nnumber of their enemies; but Saul the king of Israel, and his sons,\r\nfought courageously, and with the utmost alacrity, as knowing that their\r\nentire glory lay in nothing else but dying honorably, and exposing\r\nthemselves to the utmost danger from the enemy [for they had nothing\r\nelse to hope for]; so they brought upon themselves the whole power of\r\nthe enemy, till they were encompassed round and slain, but not before\r\nthey had killed many of the Philistines Now the sons of Saul were\r\nJonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchisua; and when these were slain the\r\nmultitude of the Hebrews were put to flight, and all was disorder, and\r\nconfusion, and slaughter, upon the Philistines pressing in upon them.\r\nBut Saul himself fled, having a strong body of soldiers about him; and\r\nupon the Philistines sending after them those that threw javelins and\r\nshot arrows, he lost all his company except a few. As for himself, he\r\nfought with great bravery; and when he had received so many wounds, that\r\nhe was not able to bear up nor to oppose any longer, and yet was not\r\nable to kill himself, he bade his armor-bearer draw his sword, and run\r\nhim through, before the enemy should take him alive. But his armor-\r\nbearer not daring to kill his master, he drew his own sword, and placing\r\nhimself over against its point, he threw himself upon it; and when he\r\ncould neither run it through him, nor, by leaning against it, make the\r\nsword pass through him, he turned him round, and asked a certain young\r\nman that stood by who he was; and when he understood that he was an\r\nAmalekite, he desired him to force the sword through him, because he was\r\nnot able to do it with his own hands, and thereby to procure him such a\r\ndeath as he desired. This the young man did accordingly; and he took the\r\ngolden bracelet that was on Saul's arm, and his royal crown that was on\r\nhis head, and ran away. And when Saul's armor-bearer saw that he was\r\nslain, he killed himself; nor did any of the king's guards escape, but\r\nthey all fell upon the mountain called Gilboa. But when those Hebrews\r\nthat dwelt in the valley beyond Jordan, and those who had their cities\r\nin the plain, heard that Saul and his sons were fallen, and that the\r\nmultitude about them were destroyed, they left their own cities, and\r\nfled to such as were the best fortified and fenced; and the Philistines,\r\nfinding those cities deserted, came and dwelt in them.\r\n\r\n8. On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip their enemies\r\nthat were slain, they got the bodies of Saul and of his sons, and\r\nstripped them, and cut off their heads; and they sent messengers all\r\nabout their country, to acquaint them that their enemies were fallen;\r\nand they dedicated their armor in the temple of Astarte, but hung their\r\nbodies on crosses at the walls of the city Bethshun, which is now called\r\nScythepolls. But when the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead heard that they\r\nhad dismembered the dead bodies of Saul and of his sons, they deemed it\r\nso horrid a thing to overlook this barbarity, and to suffer them to be\r\nwithout funeral rites, that the most courageous and hardy among them\r\n[and indeed that city had in it men that were very stout both in body\r\nand mind] journeyed all night, and came to Bethshun, and approached to\r\nthe enemy's wall, and taking down the bodies of Saul and of his sons,\r\nthey carried them to Jabesh, while the enemy were not able enough nor\r\nbold enough to hinder them, because of their great courage. So the\r\npeople of Jabesh wept all in general, and buried their bodies in the\r\nbest place of their country, which was named Areurn; and they observed a\r\npublic mourning for them seven days, with their wives and children,\r\nbeating their breasts, and lamenting the king and his sons, without\r\neither tasting meat or drink 29 [till the evening.]\r\n\r\n9. To this his end did Saul come, according to the prophecy of Samuel,\r\nbecause he disobeyed the commands of God about the Amalekites, and on\r\nthe account of his destroying the family of Ahimelech the high priest,\r\nwith Ahimelech himself, and the city of the high priests. Now Saul, when\r\nhe had reigned eighteen years while Samuel was alive, and after his\r\ndeath two [and twenty], ended his life in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Dagon, a famous maritime god or idol, is generally supposed\r\nto have been like a man above the navel, and like a fish beneath it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ Spanheim informs us here, that upon the coins of Tenedos,\r\nand those of other cities, a field-mouse is engraven, together with\r\nApollo Smintheus, or Apollo, the driver away of field-mice, on account\r\nof his being supposed to have freed certain tracts of ground from those\r\nmice; which coins show how great a judgment such mice have sometimes\r\nbeen, and how the deliverance from them was then esteemed the effect of\r\na divine power; which observations are highly suitable to this history.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ This device of the Philistines, of having a yoke of kine to\r\ndraw this cart, into which they put the ark of the Hebrews, is greatly\r\nillustrated by Sanchoniatho's account, under his ninth generation, that\r\nAgrouerus, or Agrotes, the husbandman, had a much-worshipped statue and\r\ntemple, carried about by one or more yoke of oxen, or kine, in\r\nPhoenicia, in the neighborhood of these Philistines.

See\r\nApost. Constit. B. II. ch. 27. And, indeed, since Saul had accepted\r\nkingly power, which naturally becomes ungovernable and tyrannical, as\r\nGod foretold, and the experience of all ages has shown, the Divine\r\nsettlement by Moses had soon been laid aside under the kings, had not\r\nGod, by keeping strictly to his laws, and severely executing the\r\nthreatenings therein contained, restrained Saul and other kings in some\r\ndegree of obedience to himself; nor was even this severity sufficient to\r\nrestrain most of the future kings of Israel and Judah from the grossest\r\nidolatry and impiety.

Whether, if there were a city or\r\ncountry of lay Christians without any clergymen, it were lawful for the\r\nlaity alone to baptize, or celebrate the eucharist, etc., or indeed\r\nwhether they alone could ordain themselves either bishops, priests, or\r\ndeacons, for the due performance of such sacerdotal ministrations; or\r\nwhether they ought not rather, till they procure clergymen to come among\r\nthem, to confine themselves within those bounds of piety and\r\nChristianity which belong alone to the laity; such particularly as are\r\nrecommended in the first book of the Apostolical Constitutions, which\r\npeculiarly concern the laity, and are intimated in Clement's undoubted\r\nepistle, sect. 40.

Now that these were not\r\nforeskins, with our other copies, but heads, with Josephus's copy, seems\r\nsomewhat probable, from 1 Samuel 29:4, where all copies say that it was\r\nwith the heads of such Philistines that David might reconcile himself to\r\nhis master, Saul.]\r\n\r\n\r\n18 (return) [ Since the modern Jews have lost the signification of the\r\nHebrew word here used, cebr; and since the LXX., as well as Josephus,\r\nreader it the liver of the goat, and since this rendering, and\r\nJosephus's account, are here so much more clear and probable than those\r\nof others, it is almost unaccountable that our commentators should so\r\nmuch as hesitate about its true interpretation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19 (return) [ These violent and wild agitations of Saul seem to me to\r\nhave been no other than demoniacal; and that the same demon which used\r\nto seize him, since he was forsaken of God, and which the divine hymns\r\nand psalms which were sung to the harp by David used to expel, was now\r\nin a judicial way brought upon him, not only in order to disappoint his\r\nintentions against innocent David, but to expose him to the laughter and\r\ncontempt of all that saw him, or heard of those agitations; such violent\r\nand wild agitations being never observed in true prophets, when they\r\nwere under the inspiration of the Spirit of God. Our other copies, which\r\nsay the Spirit of God came him, seem not so here copy, which mentions\r\nnothing of God at all. Nor does Josephus seem to ascribe this impulse\r\nand ecstasy of Saul to any other than to his old demoniacal spirit,\r\nwhich on all accounts appears the most probable.

When he was at\r\nKeilah still but four hundred, both in Josephus and in the LXXX.; but\r\nsix hundred in our Hebrew copies, 1 Samuel 23:3; see 30:9, 10. Now the\r\nsix hundred there mentioned are here estimated by Josephus to have been\r\nso many, only by an augmentation of two hundred afterward, which I\r\nsuppose is the true solution of this seeming disagreement.]\r\n\r\n\r\n25 (return) [ In this and the two next sections, we may perceive how\r\nJosephus, nay, how Abigail herself, would understand, the \"not avenging\r\nourselves, but heaping coals of fire on the head of the injurious,\"\r\nProverbs 25:22; Romans 12:20, not as we do now, of them into but of\r\nleaving them to the judgment of God, \"to whom vengeance belongeth,\"\r\nDeuteronomy 32:35; Psalms 94:1; Hebrews 10:30, and who will take\r\nvengeance on the wicked. And since all God's judgments are just, and all\r\nfit to be executed, and all at length for the good of the persons\r\npunished, I incline to think that to be the meaning of this phrase of\r\n\"heaping coals of fire on their heads.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n26 (return) [ We may note here, that how sacred soever an oath was\r\nesteemed among the people of God in old times, they did not think it\r\nobligatory where the action was plainly unlawful. For so we see it was\r\nin this case of David, who, although he had sworn to destroy Nabal and\r\nhis family, yet does he here, and 1 Samuel 25:32-41, bless God for\r\npreventing his keeping his oath, and shedding of blood, which he had\r\nswore to do.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27 (return) [ This history of Saul's consultation, not with a witch, as\r\nwe render the Hebrew word here, but with a necromancer, as the whole\r\nhistory shows, is easily understood, especially if we consult the\r\nRecognitions of Clement, B. I. ch. 5. at large, and more briefly, and\r\nnearer the days of Samuel Ecclus. 46:20, \"Samuel prophesied after his\r\ndeath, and showed the king his end, and lift up his voice from the earth\r\nin prophecy,\" to blot out \"the wickedness of the people.\" Nor does the\r\nexactness of the accomplishment of this prediction, the very next day,\r\npermit us to suppose any imposition upon Saul in the present history;\r\nfor as to all modern hypotheses against the natural sense of such\r\nancient and authentic histories, I take them to be of very small value\r\nor consideration.]\r\n\r\n\r\n28 (return) [ These great commendations of this necromantic woman of\r\nEndor, and of Saul's martial courage, when yet he knew he should die in\r\nthe battle, are somewhat unusual digressions in Josephus. They seem to\r\nme extracted from some speeches or declamations of his composed\r\nformerly, in the way of oratory, that lay by him, and which he thought\r\nfit to insert upon this occasion. See before on Antiq. B. I. ch. 6 sect.\r\n8.]\r\n\r\n\r\n29 (return) [ This way of speaking in Josephus, of fasting \"seven days\r\nwithout meat or drink,\" is almost like that of St. Paul, Acts 27:33,\r\n\"This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried, and continued\r\nfasting, having taken nothing:\" and as the nature of the thing, and the\r\nimpossibility of strictly fasting so long, require us here to understand\r\nboth Josephus and the sacred author of this history, 1 Samuel 30:13,\r\nfrom whom he took it, of only fasting fill the evening; so must we\r\nunderstand St. Paul, either that this was really the fourteenth day that\r\nthey had taken nothing till the evening, or else that this was the\r\nfourteenth day of their tempestuous weather in the Adriatic Sea, as ver.\r\n27, and that on this fourteenth day alone they had continued fasting,\r\nand had taken nothing before that evening. The mention of their long\r\nabstinence, ver. 21, inclines me to believe the former explication to be\r\nthe truth, and that the case was then for a fortnight what it was here\r\nfor a week, that they kept all those days entirely as lasts till the\r\nevening, but not longer.

Containing The Interval Of Forty Years.—From The Death Of Saul\r\nTo The Death Of David.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. How David Reigned Over One Tribe At Hebron While The Son Of\r\nSaul Reigned Over The Rest Of The Multitude; And How, In The Civil War\r\nWhich Then Arose Asahel And Abner Were Slain.\r\n\r\n1. This fight proved to be on the same day whereon David was come back\r\nto Ziklag, after he had overcome the Amalekites. Now when he had been\r\nalready two days at Ziklag, there came to him the man who slew Saul,\r\nwhich was the third day after the fight. He had escaped out of the\r\nbattle which the Israelites had with the Philistines, and had his\r\nclothes rent, and ashes upon his head. And when he made his obeisance to\r\nDavid, he inquired of him whence he came. He replied, from the battle of\r\nthe Israelites; and he informed him that the end of it was unfortunate,\r\nmany ten thousands of the Israelites having been cut off, and Saul,\r\ntogether with his sons, slain. He also said that he could well give him\r\nthis information, because he was present at the victory gained over the\r\nHebrews, and was with the king when he fled. Nor did he deny that he had\r\nhimself slain the king, when he was ready to be taken by the enemy, and\r\nhe himself exhorted him to do it, because, when he was fallen on his\r\nsword, his great wounds had made him so weak that he was not able to\r\nkill himself. He also produced demonstrations that the king was slain,\r\nwhich were the golden bracelets that had been on the king's arms, and\r\nhis crown, which he had taken away from Saul's dead body, and had\r\nbrought them to him. So David having no longer any room to call in\r\nquestion the truth of what he said, but seeing most evident marks that\r\nSaul was dead, he rent his garments, and continued all that day with his\r\ncompanions in weeping and lamentation. This grief was augmented by the\r\nconsideration of Jonathan; the son of Saul, who had been his most\r\nfaithful friend, and the occasion of his own deliverance. He also\r\ndemonstrated himself to have such great virtue, and such great kindness\r\nfor Saul, as not only to take his death to heart, though he had been\r\nfrequently in danger of losing his life by his means, but to punish him\r\nthat slew him; for when David had said to him that he was become his own\r\naccuser, as the very man who had slain the king, and when he had\r\nunderstood that he was the son of an Amalekite, he commanded him to be\r\nslain. He also committed to writing some lamentations and funeral\r\ncommendations of Saul and Jonathan, which have continued to my own age.\r\n\r\n2. Now when David had paid these honors to the king, he left off his\r\nmourning, and inquired of God by the prophet which of the cities of the\r\ntribe of Judah he would bestow upon him to dwell in; who answered that\r\nhe bestowed upon him Hebron. So he left Ziklag, and came to Hebron, and\r\ntook with him his wives, who were in number two, and his armed men;\r\nwhereupon all the people of the forementioned tribe came to him, and\r\nordained him their king. But when he heard that the inhabitants of\r\nJabesh- gilead had buried Saul and his sons [honorably], he sent to them\r\nand commended them, and took what they had done kindly, and promised to\r\nmake them amends for their care of those that were dead; and at the same\r\ntime he informed them that the tribe of Judah had chosen him for their\r\nking.\r\n\r\n3. But as soon as Abner, the son of Ner, who was general of Saul's army,\r\nand a very active man, and good-natured, knew that the king, and\r\nJonathan, and his two other sons, were fallen in the battle, he made\r\nhaste into the camp; and taking away with him the remaining son of Saul,\r\nwhose name was Ishbosheth, he passed over to the land beyond Jordan, and\r\nordained him the king of the whole multitude, excepting the tribe of\r\nJudah; and made his royal seat in a place called in our own language\r\nMahanaim, but in the language of the Grecians, The Camps; from whence\r\nAbner made haste with a select body of soldiers, to fight with such of\r\nthe tribe of Judah as were disposed to it, for he was angry that this\r\ntribe had set up David for their king. But Joab, whose father was Suri,\r\nand his mother Zeruiah, David's sister, who was general of David's army,\r\nmet him, according to David's appointment. He had with him his brethren,\r\nAbishai and Asahel, as also all David's armed men. Now when he met Abner\r\nat a certain fountain, in the city of Gibeon, he prepared to fight. And\r\nwhen Abner said to him, that he had a mind to know which of them had the\r\nmore valiant soldiers, it was agreed between them that twelve soldiers\r\nof each side should fight together. So those that were chosen out by\r\nboth the generals for this fight came between the two armies, and\r\nthrowing their lances one against the other, they drew their swords, and\r\ncatching one another by the head, they held one another fast, and ran\r\neach other's swords into their sides and groins, until they all, as it\r\nwere by mutual agreement, perished together. When these were fallen down\r\ndead, the rest of the army came to a sore battle, and Abner's men were\r\nbeaten; and when they were beaten, Joab did not leave off pursuing them,\r\nbut he pressed upon them, and excited the soldiers to follow them close,\r\nand not to grow weary of killing them. His brethren also pursued them\r\nwith great alacrity, especially the younger, Asahel, who was the most\r\neminent of them. He was very famous for his swiftness of foot, for he\r\ncould not only be too hard for men, but is reported to have overrun a\r\nhorse, when they had a race together. This Asahel ran violently after\r\nAbner, and would not turn in the least out of the straight way, either\r\nto the one side or to the other. Hereupon Abner turned back, and\r\nattempted artfully to avoid his violence. Sometimes he bade him leave\r\noff the pursuit, and take the armor of one of his soldiers; and\r\nsometimes, when he could not persuade him so to do, he exhorted him to\r\nrestrain himself, and not to pursue him any longer, lest he should force\r\nhim to kill him, and he should then not be able to look his brother in\r\nthe face: but when Asahel would not admit of any persuasions, but still\r\ncontinued to pursue him, Abner smote him with his spear, as he held it\r\nin his flight, and that by a back-stroke, and gave him a deadly wound,\r\nso that he died immediately; but those that were with him pursuing\r\nAbner, when they came to the place where Asahel lay, they stood round\r\nabout the dead body, and left off the pursuit of the enemy. However,\r\nboth Joab 1 himself, and his brother Abishai, ran past the dead corpse,\r\nand making their anger at the death of Asahel an occasion of greater\r\nzeal against Abner, they went on with incredible haste and alacrity, and\r\npursued Abner to a certain place called Ammah: it was about sun-set.\r\nThen did Joab ascend a certain hill, as he stood at that place, having\r\nthe tribe of Benjamin with him, whence he took a view of them, and of\r\nAbner also. Hereupon Abner cried aloud, and said that it was not fit\r\nthat they should irritate men of the same nation to fight so bitterly\r\none against another; that as for Asahel his brother, he was himself in\r\nthe wrong, when he would not be advised by him not to pursue him any\r\nfarther, which was the occasion of his wounding and death. So Joab\r\nconsented to what he said, and accepted these his words as an excuse\r\n[about Asahel], and called the soldiers back with the sound of the\r\ntrumpet, as a signal for their retreat, and thereby put a stop to any\r\nfurther pursuit. After which Joab pitched his camp there that night; but\r\nAbner marched all that night, and passed over the river Jordan, and came\r\nto Ishbosheth, Saul's son, to Mahanaim. On the next day Joab counted the\r\ndead men, and took care of all their funerals. Now there were slain of\r\nAbner's soldiers about three hundred and sixty; but of those of David\r\nnineteen, and Asahel, whose body Joab and Abishai carried to Bethlehem;\r\nand when they had buried him in the sepulcher of their fathers, they\r\ncame to David to Hebron. From this time therefore there began an\r\nintestine war, which lasted a great while, in which the followers of\r\nDavid grew stronger in the dangers they underwent, and the servants and\r\nsubjects of Saul's sons did almost every day become weaker.\r\n\r\n4. About this time David was become the father of six sons, born of as\r\nmany mothers. The eldest was by Ahinoam, and he was called Arenon; the\r\nsecond was Daniel, by his wife Abigail; the name of the third was\r\nAbsalom, by Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur; the fourth\r\nhe named Adonijah, by his wife Haggith; the fifth was Shephatiah, by\r\nAbital; the sixth he called Ithream, by Eglah. Now while this intestine\r\nwar went on, and the subjects of the two kings came frequently to action\r\nand to fighting, it was Abner, the general of the host of Saul's son,\r\nwho, by his prudence, and the great interest he had among the multitude,\r\nmade them all continue with Ishbosheth; and indeed it was a considerable\r\ntime that they continued of his party; but afterwards Abner was blamed,\r\nand an accusation was laid against him, that he went in unto Saul's\r\nconcubine: her name was Rispah, the daughter of Aiah. So when he was\r\ncomplained of by Ishbosheth, he was very uneasy and angry at it, because\r\nhe had not justice done him by Ishbosheth, to whom he had shown the\r\ngreatest kindness; whereupon he threatened to transfer the kingdom to\r\nDavid, and demonstrate that he did not rule over the people beyond\r\nJordan by his own abilities and wisdom, but by his warlike conduct and\r\nfidelity in leading his army. So he sent ambassadors to Hebron to David,\r\nand desired that he would give him security upon oath that he would\r\nesteem him his companion and his friend, upon condition that he should\r\npersuade the people to leave Saul's son, and choose him king of the\r\nwhole country; and when David had made that league with Abner, for he\r\nwas pleased with his message to him, he desired that he would give this\r\nas the first mark of performance of the present league, that he might\r\nhave his wife Michal restored to him, as her whom he had purchased with\r\ngreat hazards, and with those six hundred heads of the Philistines which\r\nhe had brought to Saul her father. So Abner took Michal from Phaltiel,\r\nwho was then her husband, and sent her to David, Ishbosheth himself\r\naffording him his assistance, for David had written to him that of right\r\nhe ought to have this his wife restored to him. Abner also called\r\ntogether the elders of the multitude, the commanders and captains of\r\nthousands, and spake thus to them: That he had formerly dissuaded them\r\nfrom their own resolution, when they were ready to forsake Ishbosheth,\r\nand to join themselves to David; that, however, he now gave them leave\r\nso to do, if they had a mind to it, for they knew that God had appointed\r\nDavid to be king of all the Hebrews by Samuel the prophet; and had\r\nforetold that he should punish the Philistines, and overcome them, and\r\nbring them under. Now when the elders and rulers heard this, and\r\nunderstood that Abner was come over to those sentiments about the public\r\naffairs which they were of before, they changed their measures, and came\r\nin to David. When these men had agreed to Abner's proposal, he called\r\ntogether the tribe of Benjamin, for all of that tribe were the guards of\r\nIshbosheth's body, and he spake to them to the same purpose. And when he\r\nsaw that they did not in the least oppose what he said, but resigned\r\nthemselves up to his opinion, he took about twenty of his friends and\r\ncame to David, in order to receive himself security upon oath from him;\r\nfor we may justly esteem those things to be firmer which every one of us\r\ndo by ourselves, than those which we do by another. He also gave him an\r\naccount of what he had said to the rulers, and to the whole tribe of\r\nBenjamin; and when David had received him in a courteous manner, and had\r\ntreated him with great hospitality for many days, Abner, when he was\r\ndismissed, desired him to bring the multitude with him, that he might\r\ndeliver up the government to him, when David himself was present, and a\r\nspectator of what was done.\r\n\r\n5. When David had sent Abner away, Joab, the of his army, came\r\nimmediately to Hebron; he had understood that Abner had been with David,\r\nand had parted with him a little before under leagues and agreements\r\nthat the government should be delivered up to David, he feared lest\r\nDavid should place Abner, who had assisted him to gain the kingdom, in\r\nthe first rank of dignity, especially since he was a shrewd man in other\r\nrespects, in understanding affairs, and in managing them artfully, as\r\nproper seasons should require, and that he should himself be put lower,\r\nand be deprived of the command of the army; so he took a knavish and a\r\nwicked course. In the first place, he endeavored to calumniate Abner to\r\nthe king, exhorting him to have a care of him, and not to give attention\r\nto what he had engaged to do for him, because all he did tended to\r\nconfirm the government to Saul's son; that he came to him deceitfully\r\nand with guile, and was gone away in hopes of gaining his purpose by\r\nthis management: but when he could not thus persuade David, nor saw him\r\nat all exasperated, he betook himself to a project bolder than the\r\nformer:—he determined to kill Abner; and in order thereto, he sent some\r\nmessengers after him, to whom he gave in charge, that when they should\r\novertake him they should recall him in David's name, and tell him that\r\nhe had somewhat to say to him about his affairs, which he had not\r\nremembered to speak of when he was with him. Now when Abner heard what\r\nthe messengers said, [for they overtook him in a certain place called\r\nBesira, which was distant from Hebron twenty furlongs,] he suspected\r\nnone of the mischief which was befalling him, and came back. Hereupon\r\nJoab met him in the gate, and received him in the kindest manner, as if\r\nhe were Abner's most benevolent acquaintance and friend; for such as\r\nundertake the vilest actions, in order to prevent the suspicion of any\r\nprivate mischief intended, do frequently make the greatest pretenses to\r\nwhat really good men sincerely do. So he took him aside from his own\r\nfollowers, as if he would speak with him in private, and brought him\r\ninto a void place of the gate, having himself nobody with him but his\r\nbrother Abishai; then he drew his sword, and smote him in the groin;\r\nupon which Abner died by this treachery of Joab, which, as he said\r\nhimself, was in the way of punishment for his brother Asahel, whom Abner\r\nsmote and slew as he was pursuing after him in the battle of Hebron, but\r\nas the truth was, out of his fear of losing his command of the army, and\r\nhis dignity with the king, and lest he should be deprived of those\r\nadvantages, and Abner should obtain the first rank in David's court. By\r\nthese examples any one may learn how many and how great instances of\r\nwickedness men will venture upon for the sake of getting money and\r\nauthority, and that they may not fail of either of them; for as when\r\nthey are desirous of obtaining the same, they acquire them by ten\r\nthousand evil practices; so when they are afraid of losing them, they\r\nget them confirmed to them by practices much worse than the former, as\r\nif no other calamity so terrible could befall them as the failure of\r\nacquiring so exalted an authority; and when they have acquired it, and\r\nby long custom found the sweetness of it, the losing it again: and since\r\nthis last would be the heaviest of all afflictions they all of them\r\ncontrive and venture upon the most difficult actions, out of the fear of\r\nlosing the same. But let it suffice that I have made these short\r\nreflections upon that subject.\r\n\r\n6. When David heard that Abner was slain, it grieved his soul; and he\r\ncalled all men to witness, with stretching out his hands to God, and\r\ncrying out that he was not a partaker in the murder of Abner, and that\r\nhis death was not procured by his command or approbation. He also wished\r\nthe heaviest curses might light upon him that slew him and upon his\r\nwhole house; and he devoted those that had assisted him in this murder\r\nto the same penalties on its account; for he took care not to appear to\r\nhave had any hand in this murder, contrary to the assurances he had\r\ngiven and the oaths he had taken to Abner. However, he commanded all the\r\npeople to weep and lament this man, and to honor his dead body with the\r\nusual solemnities; that is, by rending their garments, and putting on\r\nsackcloth, and that things should be the habit in which they should go\r\nbefore the bier; after which he followed it himself, with the elders and\r\nthose that were rulers, lamenting Abner, and by his tears demonstrating\r\nhis good-will to him while he was alive, and his sorrow for him now he\r\nwas dead, and that he was not taken off with his consent. So he buried\r\nhim at Hebron in a magnificent manner, and indited funeral elegies for\r\nhim; he also stood first over the monument weeping, and caused others to\r\ndo the same; nay, so deeply did the death of Abner disorder him, that\r\nhis companions could by no means force him to take any food, but he\r\naffirmed with an oath that he would taste nothing till the sun was set.\r\nThis procedure gained him the good-will of the multitude; for such as\r\nhad an affection for Abner were mightily satisfied with the respect he\r\npaid him when he was dead, and the observation of that faith he had\r\nplighted to him, which was shown in his vouchsafing him all the usual\r\nceremonies, as if he had been his kinsman and his friend, and not\r\nsuffering him to be neglected and injured with a dishonorable burial, as\r\nif he had been his enemy; insomuch that the entire nation rejoiced at\r\nthe king's gentleness and mildness of disposition, every one being ready\r\nto suppose that the king would have taken the same care of them in the\r\nlike circumstances, which they saw be showed in the burial of the dead\r\nbody of Abner. And indeed David principally intended to gain a good\r\nreputation, and therefore he took care to do what was proper in this\r\ncase, whence none had any suspicion that he was the author of Abner's\r\ndeath. He also said this to the multitude, that he was greatly troubled\r\nat the death of so good a man; and that the affairs of the Hebrews had\r\nsuffered great detriment by being deprived of him, who was of so great\r\nabilities to preserve them by his excellent advice, and by the strength\r\nof his hands in war. But he added, that \"God, who hath a regard to all\r\nmen's actions, will not suffer this man [Joab] to go off unrevenged; but\r\nknow ye, that I am not able to do any thing to these sons of Zeruiah,\r\nJoab and Abishai, who have more power than I have; but God will requite\r\ntheir insolent attempts upon their own heads.\" And this was the fatal\r\nconclusion of the life of Abner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. That Upon The Slaughter Of Ishbosheth By The Treachery Of His\r\nFriends, David Received The Whole Kingdom.\r\n\r\n1. When Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, had heard of the death of Abner, he\r\ntook it to heart to be deprived of a man that was of his kindred, and\r\nhad indeed given him the kingdom, but was greatly afflicted, and Abner's\r\ndeath very much troubled him; nor did he himself outlive any long time,\r\nbut was treacherously set upon by the sons of Rimmon, [Baanah and Rechab\r\nwere their names,] and was slain by them; for these being of a family of\r\nthe Benjamites, and of the first rank among them, thought that if they\r\nshould slay Ishbosheth, they should obtain large presents from David,\r\nand be made commanders by him, or, however, should have some other trust\r\ncommitted to them. So when they once found him alone, and asleep at\r\nnoon, in an upper room, when none of his guards were there, and when the\r\nwoman that kept the door was not watching, but was fallen asleep also,\r\npartly on account of the labor she had undergone, and partly on account\r\nof the heat of the day, these men went into the room in which\r\nIshbosheth, Saul's son, lay asleep, and slew him; they also cut off his\r\nhead, and took their journey all that night, and the next day, as\r\nsupposing themselves flying away from those they had injured, to one\r\nthat would accept of this action as a favor, and would afford them\r\nsecurity. So they came to Hebron, and showed David the head of\r\nIshbosheth, and presented themselves to him as his well-wishers, and\r\nsuch as had killed one that was his enemy and antagonist. Yet David did\r\nnot relish what they had done as they expected, but said to them, \"You\r\nvile wretches, you shall immediately receive the punishment you deserve.\r\nDid not you know what vengeance I executed on him that murdered Saul,\r\nand brought me his crown of gold, and this while he who made this\r\nslaughter did it as a favor to him, that he might not be caught by his\r\nenemies? Or do you imagine that I am altered in my disposition, and\r\nsuppose that I am not the same man I then was, but am pleased with men\r\nthat are wicked doers, and esteem your vile actions, when you are become\r\nmurderers of your master, as grateful to me, when you have slain a\r\nrighteous man upon his bed, who never did evil to any body, and treated\r\nyou with great good-will and respect? Wherefore you shall suffer the\r\npunishment due on his account, and the vengeance I ought to inflict upon\r\nyou for killing Ishbosheth, and for supposing that I should take his\r\ndeath kindly at your hands; for you could not lay a greater blot on my\r\nhonor, than by making such a supposal.\" When David had said this, he\r\ntormented them with all sorts of torments, and then put them to death;\r\nand he bestowed all accustomed rites on the burial of the head of\r\nIshbosheth, and laid it in the grave of Abner.\r\n\r\n2. When these things were brought to this conclusion, all the principal\r\nmen of the Hebrew people came to David to Hebron, with the heads of\r\nthousands, and other rulers, and delivered themselves up to him, putting\r\nhim in mind of the good-will they had borne to him in Saul's lifetime,\r\nand the respect they then had not ceased to pay him when he was captain\r\nof a thousand, as also that he was chosen of God by Samuel the prophet,\r\nhe and his sons; 2 and declaring besides, how God had given him power to\r\nsave the land of the Hebrews, and to overcome the Philistines. Whereupon\r\nhe received kindly this their alacrity on his account; and exhorted them\r\nto continue in it, for that they should have no reason to repent of\r\nbeing thus disposed to him. So when he had feasted them, and treated\r\nthem kindly, he sent them out to bring all the people to him; upon which\r\ncame to him about six thousand and eight hundred armed men of the tribe\r\nof Judah, who bare shields and spears for their weapons, for these had\r\n[till now] continued with Saul's son, when the rest of the tribe of\r\nJudah had ordained David for their king. There came also seven thousand\r\nand one hundred out of the tribe of Simeon. Out of the tribe of Levi\r\ncame four thousand and seven hundred, having Jehoiada for their leader.\r\nAfter these came Zadok the high priest, with twenty-two captains of his\r\nkindred. Out of the tribe of Benjamin the armed men were four thousand;\r\nbut the rest of the tribe continued, still expecting that some one of\r\nthe house of Saul should reign over them. Those of the tribe of Ephraim\r\nwere twenty thousand and eight hundred, and these mighty men of valor,\r\nand eminent for their strength. Out of the half tribe of Manasseh came\r\neighteen thousand, of the most potent men. Out of the tribe of Issachar\r\ncame two hundred, who foreknew what was to come hereafter, 3 but of\r\narmed men twenty thousand. Of the tribe of Zebulon fifty thousand chosen\r\nmen. This was the only tribe that came universally in to David, and all\r\nthese had the same weapons with the tribe of Gad. Out of the tribe of\r\nNaphtali the eminent men and rulers were one thousand, whose weapons\r\nwere shields and spears, and the tribe itself followed after, being [in\r\na manner] innumerable [thirty- seven thousand]. Out of the tribe of Dan\r\nthere were of chosen men twenty-seven thousand and six hundred. Out of\r\nthe tribe of Asher were forty thousand. Out of the two tribes that were\r\nbeyond Jordan, and the rest of the tribe of Manasseh, such as used\r\nshields, and spears, and head-pieces, and swords, were a hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand. The rest of the tribes also made use of swords. This\r\nmultitude came together to Hebron to David, with a great quantity of\r\ncorn, and wine, and all other sorts of food, and established David in\r\nhis kingdom with one consent. And when the people had rejoiced for three\r\ndays in Hebron, David and all the people removed and came to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How David Laid Siege To Jerusalem; And When He Had Taken The\r\nCity, He Cast The Canaanites Out Of It, And Brought In The Jews To\r\nInhabit Therein.\r\n\r\n1. Now the Jebusites, who were the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and were by\r\nextraction Canaanites, shut their gates, and placed the blind, and the\r\nlame, and all their maimed persons, upon the wall, in way of derision of\r\nthe king, and said that the very lame themselves would hinder his\r\nentrance into it. This they did out of contempt of his power, and as\r\ndepending on the strength of their walls. David was hereby enraged, and\r\nbegan the siege of Jerusalem, and employed his utmost diligence and\r\nalacrity therein, as intending by the taking of this place to\r\ndemonstrate his power, and to intimidate all others that might be of the\r\nlike [evil] disposition towards him. So he took the lower city by force,\r\nbut the citadel held out still; 4 whence it was that the king, knowing\r\nthat the proposal of dignities and rewards would encourage the soldiers\r\nto greater actions, promised that he who should first go over the\r\nditches that were beneath the citadel, and should ascend to the citadel\r\nitself and take it, should have the command of the entire people\r\nconferred upon him. So they all were ambitious to ascend, and thought no\r\npains too great in order to ascend thither, out of their desire of the\r\nchief command. However, Joab, the son of Zeruiah, prevented the rest;\r\nand as soon as he was got up to the citadel, cried out to the king, and\r\nclaimed the chief command.\r\n\r\n2. When David had cast the Jebusites out of the citadel, he also rebuilt\r\nJerusalem, and named it The City of David, and abode there all the time\r\nof his reign; but for the time that he reigned over the tribe of Judah\r\nonly in Hebron, it was seven years and six months. Now when he had\r\nchosen Jerusalem to be his royal city, his affairs did more and more\r\nprosper, by the providence of God, who took care that they should\r\nimprove and be augmented. Hiram also, the king of the Tyrians, sent\r\nambassadors to him, and made a league of mutual friendship and\r\nassistance with him. He also sent him presents, cedar-trees, and\r\nmechanics, and men skillful in building and architecture, that they\r\nmight build him a royal palace at Jerusalem. Now David made buildings\r\nround about the lower city: he also joined the citadel to it, and made\r\nit one body; and when he had encompassed all with walls, he appointed\r\nJoab to take care of them. It was David, therefore, who first cast the\r\nJebusites out of Jerusalem, and called it by his own name, The City of\r\nDavid: for under our forefather Abraham it was called [Salem, or]\r\nSolyma; 5 but after that time, some say that Homer mentions it by that\r\nname of Solyma, [for he named the temple Solyma, according to the Hebrew\r\nlanguage, which denotes security.] Now the whole time from the warfare\r\nunder Joshua our general against the Canaanites, and from that war in\r\nwhich he overcame them, and distributed the land among the Hebrews, [nor\r\ncould the Israelites ever cast the Canaanites out of Jerusalem until\r\nthis time, when David took it by siege,] this whole time was five\r\nhundred and fifteen years.\r\n\r\n3. I shall now make mention of Araunah, who was a wealthy man among the\r\nJebusites, but was not slain by David in the siege of Jerusalem, because\r\nof the good-will he bore to the Hebrews, and a particular benignity and\r\naffection which he had to the king himself; which I shall take a more\r\nseasonable opportunity to speak of a little afterwards. Now David\r\nmarried other wives over and above those which he had before: he had\r\nalso concubines. The sons whom he had were in number eleven, whose names\r\nwere Amnon, Emnos, Eban, Nathan, Solomon, Jeban, Elien, Phalna,\r\nEnnaphen, Jenae, Eliphale; and a daughter, Tamar. Nine of these were\r\nborn of legitimate wives, but the two last-named of concubines; and\r\nTamar had the same mother with Absalom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. That When David Had Conquered The Philistines Who Made War\r\nAgainst Him At Jerusalem, He Removed The Ark To Jerusalem And Had A Mind\r\nTo Build A Temple.\r\n\r\n1. When the Philistines understood that David was made king of the\r\nHebrews, they made war against him at Jerusalem; and when they had\r\nseized upon that valley which is called The Valley of the Giants, and is\r\na place not far from the city, they pitched their camp therein; but the\r\nking of the Jews, who never permitted himself to do any thing without\r\nprophecy, 6 and the command of God and without depending on him as a\r\nsecurity for the time to come, bade the high priest to foretell to him\r\nwhat was the will of God, and what would be the event of this battle.\r\nAnd when he foretold that he should gain the victory and the dominion,\r\nhe led out his army against the Philistines; and when the battle was\r\njoined, he came himself behind, and fell upon the enemy on the sudden,\r\nand slew some of them, and put the rest to flight. And let no one\r\nsuppose that it was a small army of the Philistines that came against\r\nthe Hebrews, as guessing so from the suddenness of their defeat, and\r\nfrom their having performed no great action, or that was worth\r\nrecording, from the slowness of their march, and want of courage; but\r\nlet him know that all Syria and Phoenicia, with many other nations\r\nbesides them, and those warlike nations also, came to their assistance,\r\nand had a share in this war, which thing was the only cause why, when\r\nthey had been so often conquered, and had lost so many ten thousands of\r\ntheir men, they still came upon the Hebrews with greater armies; nay,\r\nindeed, when they had so often failed of their purpose in these battles,\r\nthey came upon David with an army three times as numerous as before, and\r\npitched their camp on the same spot of ground as before. The king of\r\nIsrael therefore inquired of God again concerning the event of the\r\nbattle; and the high priest prophesied to him, that he should keep his\r\narmy in the groves, called the Groves of Weeping, which were not far\r\nfrom the enemy's camp, and that he should not move, nor begin to fight,\r\ntill the trees of the grove should be in motion without the wind's\r\nblowing; but as soon as these trees moved, and the time foretold to him\r\nby God was come, he should, without delay, go out to gain what was an\r\nalready prepared and evident victory; for the several ranks of the\r\nenemy's army did not sustain him, but retreated at the first onset, whom\r\nhe closely followed, and slew them as he went along, and pursued them to\r\nthe city Gaza [which is the limit of their country]: after this he\r\nspoiled their camp, in which he found great riches; and he destroyed\r\ntheir gods.\r\n\r\n2. When this had proved the event of the battle, David thought it\r\nproper, upon a consultation with the elders, and rulers, and captains of\r\nthousands, to send for those that were in the flower of their age out of\r\nall his countrymen, and out of the whole land, and withal for the\r\npriests and the Levites, in order to their going to Kirjathjearim, to\r\nbring up the ark of God out of that city, and to carry it to Jerusalem,\r\nand there to keep it, and offer before it those sacrifices and those\r\nother honors with which God used to be well-pleased; for had they done\r\nthus in the reign of Saul, they had not undergone any great misfortunes\r\nat all. So when the whole body of the people were come together, as they\r\nhad resolved to do, the king came to the ark, which the priest brought\r\nout of the house of Aminadab, and laid it upon a new cart, and permitted\r\ntheir brethren and their children to draw it, together with the oxen.\r\nBefore it went the king, and the whole multitude of the people with him,\r\nsinging hymns to God, and making use of all sorts of songs usual among\r\nthem, with variety of the sounds of musical instruments, and with\r\ndancing and singing of psalms, as also with the sounds of trumpets and\r\nof cymbals, and so brought the ark to Jerusalem. But as they were come\r\nto the threshing-floor of Chidon, a place so called, Uzzah was slain by\r\nthe anger of God; for as the oxen shook the ark, he stretched out his\r\nhand, and would needs take hold of it. Now, because he was not a priest\r\n7 and yet touched the ark, God struck him dead. Hereupon both the king\r\nand the people were displeased at the death of Uzzah; and the place\r\nwhere he died is still called the Breach of Uzzah unto this day. So\r\nDavid was afraid; and supposing that if he received the ark to himself\r\ninto the city, he might suffer in the like manner as Uzzah had suffered,\r\nwho, upon his bare putting out his hand to the ark, died in the manner\r\nalready mentioned, he did not receive it to himself into the city, but\r\nhe took it aside unto a certain place belonging to a righteous man,\r\nwhose name was Obededom, who was by his family a Levite, and deposited\r\nthe ark with him; and it remained there three entire months. This\r\naugmented the house of Obededom, and conferred many blessings upon it.\r\nAnd when the king heard what had befallen Obededom, how he was become,\r\nof a poor man in a low estate, exceeding happy, and the object of envy\r\nto all those that saw or inquired after his house, he took courage, and,\r\nhoping that he should meet with no misfortune thereby, he transferred\r\nthe ark to his own house; the priests carrying it, while seven companies\r\nof singers, who were set in that order by the king, went before it, and\r\nwhile he himself played upon the harp, and joined in the music,\r\ninsomuch, that when his wife Michel, the daughter of Saul, who was our\r\nfirst king, saw him so doing, she laughed at him. But when they had\r\nbrought in the ark, they placed it under the tabernacle which David had\r\npitched for it, and he offered costly sacrifices and peace-offerings,\r\nand treated the whole multitude, and dealt both to the women, and the\r\nmen, and the infants a loaf of bread and a cake, and another cake baked\r\nin a pan, with the portion of the sacrifice. So when he had thus feasted\r\nthe people, he sent them away, and he himself returned to his own house.\r\n\r\n3. But when Michal his wife, the daughter of Saul, came and stood by\r\nhim, she wished him all other happiness, and entreated that whatsoever\r\nhe should further desire, to the utmost possibility, might be given him\r\nby God, and that he might be favorable to him; yet did she blame him,\r\nthat so great a king as he was should dance after an unseemly manner,\r\nand in his dancing, uncover himself among the servants and the\r\nhandmaidens. But he replied, that he was not ashamed to do what was\r\nacceptable to God, who had preferred him before her father, and before\r\nall others; that he would play frequently, and dance, without any regard\r\nto what the handmaidens and she herself thought of it. So this Michal,\r\nwho was David's wife, had no children; however, when she was afterward\r\nmarried to him to whom Saul her father had given her, [for at this time\r\nDavid had taken her away from him, and had her himself,] she bare five\r\nchildren. But concerning those matters I shall discourse in a proper\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n4. Now when the king saw that his affairs grew better almost every day,\r\nby the will of God, he thought he should offend him, if, while he\r\nhimself continued in houses made of cedar, such as were of a great\r\nheight, and had the most curious works of architecture in them, he\r\nshould overlook the ark while it was laid in a tabernacle, and was\r\ndesirous to build a temple to God, as Moses had predicted such a temple\r\nshould be built. 8 And when he had discoursed with Nathan the prophet\r\nabout these things, and had been encouraged by him to do whatsoever he\r\nhad a mind to do, as having God with him, and his helper in all things,\r\nhe was thereupon the more ready to set about that building. But God\r\nappeared to Nathan that very night, and commanded him to say to David, 9\r\nthat he took his purpose and his desires kindly, since nobody had before\r\nnow taken it into their head to build him a temple, although upon his\r\nhaving such a notion he would not permit him to build him that temple,\r\nbecause he had made many wars, and was defiled with the slaughter of his\r\nenemies; that, however, after his death, in his old age, and when he had\r\nlived a long life, there should be a temple built by a son of his, who\r\nshould take the kingdom after him, and should be called Solomon, whom he\r\npromised to provide for, as a father provides for his son, by preserving\r\nthe kingdom for his son's posterity, and delivering it to them; but that\r\nhe would still punish him, if he sinned, with diseases and barrenness of\r\nland. When David understood this from the prophet, and was overjoyful at\r\nthis knowledge of the sure continuance of the dominion to his posterity,\r\nand that his house should be splendid, and very famous, he came to the\r\nark, and fell down on his face, and began to adore God, and to return\r\nthanks to him for all his benefits, as well for those that he had\r\nalready bestowed upon him in raising him from a low state, and from the\r\nemployment of a shepherd, to so great dignity of dominion and glory; as\r\nfor those also which he had promised to his posterity; and besides, for\r\nthat providence which he had exercised over the Hebrews in procuring\r\nthem the liberty they enjoyed. And when he had said thus, and had sung a\r\nhymn of praise to God, he went his way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How David Brought Under The Philistines, And The Moabites,\r\nAnd The Kings Of Sophene And Of Damascus, And Of The Syrians As Also The\r\nIdumeans, In War; And How He Made A League With The King Of Hamath; And\r\nWas Mindful Of The Friendship That Jonathan, The Son Of Saul, Had Borne\r\nHim.\r\n\r\n1. A Litlle while after this, he considered that he ought to make war\r\nagainst the Philistines, and not to see any idleness or laziness\r\npermitted in his management, that so it might prove, as God had foretold\r\nto him, that when he had overthrown his enemies, he should leave his\r\nposterity to reign in peace afterward: so he called together his army\r\nagain, and when he had charged them to be ready and prepared for war,\r\nand when he thought that all things in his army were in a good state, he\r\nremoved from Jerusalem, and came against the Philistines; and when he\r\nhad overcome them in battle, and had cut off a great part of their\r\ncountry, and adjoined it to the country of the Hebrews, he transferred\r\nthe war to the Moabites; and when he had overcome two parts of their\r\narmy in battle, he took the remaining part captive, and imposed tribute\r\nupon them, to be paid annually. He then made war against Iadadezer, the\r\nson of Rehob, king of Sophene; 10 and when he had joined battle with him\r\nat 'the river Euphrates, he destroyed twenty thousand of his footmen,\r\nand about seven thousand of his horsemen. He also took a thousand of his\r\nchariots, and destroyed the greatest part of them, and ordered that no\r\nmore than one hundred should be kept. 11\r\n\r\n2. Now when Hadad, king of Damascus and of Syria, heard that David\r\nfought against Hadadezer, who was his friend, he came to his assistance\r\nwith a powerful army, in hopes to rescue him; and when he had joined\r\nbattle with David at the river Euphrates, he failed of his purpose, and\r\nlost in the battle a great number of his soldiers; for there were slain\r\nof the army of Hadad twenty thousand, and all the rest fled. Nicelens\r\nalso [of Damascus] makes mention of this king in the fourth book of his\r\nhistories; where he speaks thus: \"A great while after these things had\r\nhappened, there was one of that country whose name was Hadad, who was\r\nbecome very potent; he reigned over Damascus, and, the other parts of\r\nSyria, excepting Phoenicia. He made war against David, the king of\r\nJudea, and tried his fortune in many battles, and particularly in the\r\nlast battle at Euphrates, wherein he was beaten. He seemed to have been\r\nthe most excellent of all their kings in strength and manhood,\" Nay,\r\nbesides this, he says of his posterity, that \"they succeeded one another\r\nin his kingdom, and in his name;\" where he thus speaks: \"When Hadad was\r\ndead, his posterity reigned for ten generations, each of his successors\r\nreceiving from his father that his dominion, and this his name; as did\r\nthe Ptolemies in Egypt. But the third was the most powerful of them all,\r\nand was willing to avenge the defeat his forefather had received; so he\r\nmade an expedition against the Jews, and laid waste the city which is\r\nnow called Samaria.\" Nor did he err from the truth; for this is that\r\nHadad who made the expedition against Samaria, in the reign of Ahab,\r\nking of Israel, concerning whom we shall speak in due place hereafter.\r\n\r\n3. Now when David had made an expedition against Damascus, and the other\r\nparts of Syria, and had brought it all into subjection, and had placed\r\ngarrisons in the country, and appointed that they should pay tribute, he\r\nreturned home. He also dedicated to God at Jerusalem the golden quivers,\r\nthe entire armor which the guards of Hadad used to wear; which Shishak,\r\nthe king of Egypt, took away when he fought with David's grandson,\r\nRehoboam, with a great deal of other wealth which he carried out of\r\nJerusalem. However, these things will come to be explained in their\r\nproper places hereafter. Now as for the king of the Hebrews, he was\r\nassisted by God, who gave him great success in his wars, and he made all\r\nexpedition against the best cities of Hadadezer, Betah and Machen; so he\r\ntook them by force, and laid them waste. Therein was found a very great\r\nquantity of gold and silver, besides that sort of brass which is said to\r\nbe more valuable than gold; of which brass Solomon made that large\r\nvessel which was called The [Brazen] Sea, and those most curious lavers,\r\nwhen he built the temple for God.\r\n\r\n4. But when the king of Hamath was informed of the ill success of\r\nHadadezer, and had heard of the ruin of his army, he was afraid on his\r\nown account, and resolved to make a league of friendship and fidelity\r\nwith David before he should come against him; so he sent to him his son\r\nJoram, and professed that he owed him thanks for fighting against\r\nHadadezer, who was his enemy, and made a league with him of mutual\r\nassistance and friendship. He also sent him presents, vessels of ancient\r\nworkmanship, both of gold, of silver, and of brass. So when David had\r\nmade this league of mutual assistance with Toi, [for that was the name\r\nof the king of Hamath,] and had received the presents he sent him, he\r\ndismissed his son with that respect which was due on both sides; but\r\nthen David brought those presents that were sent by him, as also the\r\nrest of the gold and silver which he had taken of the cities whom he had\r\nconquered, and dedicated them to God. Nor did God give victory and\r\nsuccess to him only when he went to the battle himself, and led his own\r\narmy, but he gave victory to Abishai, the brother of Joab, general of\r\nhis forces, over the Idumeans, 12 and by him to David, when he sent him\r\nwith an army into Idumea: for Abishai destroyed eighteen thousand of\r\nthem in the battle; whereupon the king [of Israel] placed garrisons\r\nthrough all Idumea, and received the tribute of the country, and of\r\nevery head among them. Now David was in his nature just, and made his\r\ndetermination with regard to truth. He had for the general of his whole\r\narmy Joab; and he made Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, recorder. He also\r\nappointed Zadok, of the family of Phinehas, to be high priest, together\r\nwith Abiathar, for he was his friend. He also made Seisan the scribe,\r\nand committed the command over the guards of his body to Benaiah; the\r\nson of Jehoiada. His elder sons were near his body, and had the care of\r\nit also.\r\n\r\n5. He also called to mind the covenants and the oaths he had made with\r\nJonathan, the son of Saul, and the friendship and affection Jonathan had\r\nfor him; for besides all the rest of his excellent qualities with which\r\nhe was endowed, he was also exceeding mindful of such as had at other\r\ntimes bestowed benefits upon him. He therefore gave order that inquiry\r\nshould be made, whether any of Jonathan's lineage were living, to whom\r\nhe might make return of that familiar acquaintance which Jonathan had\r\nhad with him, and for which he was still debtor. And when one of Saul's\r\nfreed men was brought to him, who was acquainted with those of his\r\nfamily that were still living, he asked him whether he could tell him of\r\nany one belonging to Jonathan that was now alive, and capable of a\r\nrequital of the benefits which he had received from Jonathan. And he\r\nsaid, that a son of his was remaining, whose name was Mephibosheth, but\r\nthat he was lame of his feet; for that when his nurse heard that the\r\nfather and grandfather of the child were fallen in the battle, she\r\nsnatched him up, and fled away, and let him fall from her shoulders, and\r\nhis feet were lamed. So when he had learned where and by whom he was\r\nbrought up, he sent messengers to Machir, to the city of Lodebar, for\r\nwith him was the son of Jonathan brought up, and sent for him to come to\r\nhim. So when Mephibosheth came to the king, he fell on his face and\r\nworshipped him; but David encouraged him, bade him be of good cheer, and\r\nexpect better times. So he gave him his father's house, and all the\r\nestate which his grandfather Saul was in possession of, and bade him\r\ncome and diet with him at his own table, and never to be absent one day\r\nfrom that table. And when the youth had worshipped him on account of his\r\nwords and gifts given to him, he called for Ziba, and told him that he\r\nhad given the youth his father's house, and all Saul's estate. He also\r\nordered that Ziba should cultivate his land, and take care of it, and\r\nbring him the profits of all to Jerusalem. Accordingly, David brought\r\nhim to his table every day, and bestowed upon the youth, Ziba and his\r\nsons, who were in number fifteen, and his servants, who were in number\r\ntwenty. When the king had made these appointments, and Ziba had\r\nworshipped him, and promised to do all that he had bidden him, he went\r\nhis way; so that this son of Jonathan dwelt at Jerusalem, and dieted at\r\nthe king's table, and had the same care that a son could claim taken of\r\nhim. He also had himself a son, whom he named Micha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How The War Was Waged Against The Ammonites And Happily\r\nConcluded.\r\n\r\n1. This were the honors that such as were left of Saul's and Jonathan's\r\nlineage received from David. About this time died Nahash, the king of\r\nthe Ammonites, who was a friend of David's; and when his son had\r\nsucceeded his father in the kingdom, David sent ambassadors to him to\r\ncomfort him; and exhorted him to take his father's death patiently, and\r\nto expect that he would continue the same kindness to himself which he\r\nhad shown to his father. But the princes of the Ammonites took this\r\nmessage in evil part, and not as David's kind dispositions gave reason\r\nto take it; and they excited the king to resent it; and said that David\r\nhad sent men to spy out the country, and what strength it had, under the\r\npretense of humanity and kindness. They further advised him to have a\r\ncare, and not to give heed to David's words, lest he should be deluded\r\nby him, and so fall into an inconsolable calamity. Accordingly Nahash's\r\n[son], the king of the Ammonites, thought these princes spake what was\r\nmore probable than the truth would admit, and so abused the ambassadors\r\nafter a very harsh manner; for he shaved the one half of their beards,\r\nand cut off one half of their garments, and sent his answer, not in\r\nwords, but in deeds. When the king of Israel saw this, he had\r\nindignation at it, and showed openly that he would not overlook this\r\ninjurious and contumelious treatment, but would make war with the\r\nAmmonites, and would avenge this wicked treatment of his ambassadors on\r\ntheir king. So that king's intimate friends and commanders,\r\nunderstanding that they had violated their league, and were liable to be\r\npunished for the same, made preparations for war; they also sent a\r\nthousand talents to the Syrian king of Mesopotamia, and endeavored to\r\nprevail with him to assist them for that pay, and Shobach. Now these\r\nkings had twenty thousand footmen. They also hired the king of the\r\ncountry called Maacah, and a fourth king, by name Ishtob; which last had\r\ntwelve thousand armed men.\r\n\r\n2. But David was under no consternation at this confederacy, nor at the\r\nforces of the Ammonites; and putting his trust in God, because he was\r\ngoing to war in a just cause, on account of the injurious treatment he\r\nhad met with, he immediately sent Joab, the captain of his host, against\r\nthem, and gave him the flower of his army, who pitched his camp by\r\nRabbah, the metropolis of the Ammonites; whereupon the enemy came out,\r\nand set themselves in array, not all of them together, but in two\r\nbodies; for the auxiliaries were set in array in the plain by\r\nthemselves, but the army of the Ammonites at the gates over against the\r\nHebrews. When Joab saw this, he opposed one stratagem against another,\r\nand chose out the most hardy part of his men, and set them in opposition\r\nto the king of Syria, and the kings that were with him, and gave the\r\nother part to his brother Abishai, and bid him set them in opposition to\r\nthe Ammonites; and said to him, that in case he should see that the\r\nSyrians distressed him, and were too hard for him, he should order his\r\ntroops to turn about and assist him; and he said that he himself would\r\ndo the same to him, if he saw him in the like distress from the\r\nAmmonites. So he sent his brother before, and encouraged him to do every\r\nthing courageously and with alacrity, which would teach them to be\r\nafraid of disgrace, and to fight manfully; and so he dismissed him to\r\nfight with the Ammonites, while he fell upon the Syrians. And though\r\nthey made a strong opposition for a while, Joab slew many of them, but\r\ncompelled the rest to betake themselves to flight; which, when the\r\nAmmonites saw, and were withal afraid of Abishai and his army, they\r\nstaid no longer, but imitated their auxiliaries, and fled to the city.\r\nSo Joab, when he had thus overcome the enemy, returned with great joy to\r\nJerusalem to the king.\r\n\r\n3. This defeat did not still induce the Ammonites to be quiet, nor to\r\nown those that were superior to them to be so, and be still, but they\r\nsent to Chalaman, the king of the Syrians, beyond Euphrates, and hired\r\nhim for an auxiliary. He had Shobach for the captain of his host, with\r\neighty thousand footmen, and ten thousand horsemen. Now when the king of\r\nthe Hebrews understood that the Ammonites had again gathered so great an\r\narmy together, he determined to make war with them no longer by his\r\ngenerals, but he passed over the river Jordan himself with all his army;\r\nand when he met them he joined battle with them, and overcame them, and\r\nslew forty thousand of their footmen, and seven thousand of their\r\nhorsemen. He also wounded Shobach, the general of Chalaman's forces, who\r\ndied of that stroke; but the people of Mesopotamia, upon such a\r\nconclusion of the battle, delivered themselves up to David, and sent him\r\npresents, who at winter time returned to Jerusalem. But at the beginning\r\nof the spring he sent Joab, the captain of his host, to fight against\r\nthe Ammonites, who overran all their country, and laid it waste, and\r\nshut them up in their metropolis Rabbah, and besieged them therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How David Fell In Love With Bathsheba, And Slew Her Husband\r\nUriah, For Which He Is Reproved By Nathan.\r\n\r\n1. But David fell now into a very grievous sin, though he were otherwise\r\nnaturally a righteous and a religious man, and one that firmly observed\r\nthe laws of our fathers; for when late in an evening he took a view\r\nround him from the roof of his royal palace, where he used to walk at\r\nthat hour, he saw a woman washing herself in her own house: she was one\r\nof extraordinary beauty, and therein surpassed all other women; her name\r\nwas Bathsheba. So he was overcome by that woman's beauty, and was not\r\nable to restrain his desires, but sent for her, and lay with her.\r\nHereupon she conceived with child, and sent to the king, that he should\r\ncontrive some way for concealing her sin [for, according to the laws of\r\ntheir fathers, she who had been guilty of adultery ought to be put to\r\ndeath]. So the king sent for Joab's armor-bearer from the siege, who was\r\nthe woman's husband, and his name was Uriah. And when he was come, the\r\nking inquired of him about the army, and about the siege; and when he\r\nhad made answer that all their affairs went according to their wishes,\r\nthe king took some portions of meat from his supper, and gave them to\r\nhim, and bade him go home to his wife, and take his rest with her. Uriah\r\ndid not do so, but slept near the king with the rest of his armor-\r\nbearers. When the king was informed of this, he asked him why he did not\r\ngo home to his house, and to his wife, after so long an absence; which\r\nis the natural custom of all men, when they come from a long journey. He\r\nreplied, that it was not right, while his fellow soldiers, and the\r\ngeneral of the army, slept upon the ground, in the camp, and in an\r\nenemy's country, that he should go and take his rest, and solace himself\r\nwith his wife. So when he had thus replied, the king ordered him to stay\r\nthere that night, that he might dismiss him the next day to the general.\r\nSo the king invited Uriah to supper, and after a cunning and dexterous\r\nmanlier plied him with drink at supper, till he was thereby disordered;\r\nyet did he nevertheless sleep at the king's gates without any\r\ninclination to go to his wife. Upon this the king was very angry at him;\r\nand wrote to Joab, and commanded him to punish Uriah, for he told him\r\nthat he had offended him; and he suggested to him the manner in which he\r\nwould have him punished, that it might not be discovered that he was\r\nhimself the author of this his punishment; for he charged him to set him\r\nover against that part of the enemy's army where the attack would be\r\nmost hazardous, and where he might be deserted, and be in the greatest\r\njeopardy, for he bade him order his fellow soldiers to retire out of the\r\nfight. When he had written thus to him, and sealed the letter with his\r\nown seal, he gave it to Uriah to carry to Joab. When Joab had received\r\nit, and upon reading it understood the king's purpose, he set Uriah in\r\nthat place where he knew the enemy would be most troublesome to them;\r\nand gave him for his partners some of the best soldiers in the army; and\r\nsaid that he would also come to their assistance with the whole army,\r\nthat if possible they might break down some part of the wall, and enter\r\nthe city. And he desired him to be glad of the opportunity of exposing\r\nhimself to such great pains, and not to be displeased at it, since he\r\nwas a valiant soldier, and had a great reputation for his valor, both\r\nwith the king and with his countrymen. And when Uriah undertook the work\r\nhe was set upon with alacrity, he gave private orders to those who were\r\nto be his companions, that when they saw the enemy make a sally, they\r\nshould leave him. When, therefore, the Hebrews made an attack upon the\r\ncity, the Ammonites were afraid that the enemy might prevent them, and\r\nget up into the city, and this at the very place whither Uriah was\r\nordered; so they exposed their best soldiers to be in the forefront, and\r\nopened their gates suddenly, and fell upon the enemy with great\r\nvehemence, and ran violently upon them. When those that were with Uriah\r\nsaw this, they all retreated backward, as Joab had directed them\r\nbeforehand; but Uriah, as ashamed to run away and leave his post,\r\nsustained the enemy, and receiving the violence of their onset, he slew\r\nmany of them; but being encompassed round, and caught in the midst of\r\nthem, he was slain, and some other of his companions were slain with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n2. When this was done, Joab sent messengers to the king, and ordered\r\nthem to tell him that he did what he could to take the city soon; but\r\nthat, as they made an assault on the wall, they had been forced to\r\nretire with great loss; and bade them, if they saw the king was angry at\r\nit, to add this, that Uriah was slain also. When the king had heard this\r\nof the messengers, he took it heinously, and said that they did wrong\r\nwhen they assaulted the wall, whereas they ought, by undermining and\r\nother stratagems of war, to endeavor the taking of the city, especially\r\nwhen they had before their eyes the example of Abimelech, the son of\r\nGideon, who would needs take the tower in Thebes by force, and was\r\nkilled by a large stone thrown at him by an old woman; and although he\r\nwas a man of great prowess, he died ignominiously by the dangerous\r\nmanner of his assault: that they should remember this accident, and not\r\ncome near the enemy's wall, for that the best method of making war with\r\nsuccess was to call to mind the accidents of former wars, and what good\r\nor bad success had attended them in the like dangerous cases, that so\r\nthey might imitate the one, and avoid the other. But when the king was\r\nin this disposition, the messenger told him that Uriah was slain also;\r\nwhereupon he was pacified. So he bade the messenger go back to Joab and\r\ntell him that this misfortune is no other than what is common among\r\nmankind, and that such is the nature, and such the accidents of war,\r\ninsomuch that sometimes the enemy will have success therein, and\r\nsometimes others; but that he ordered him to go on still in his care\r\nabout the siege, that no ill accident might befall him in it hereafter;\r\nthat they should raise bulwarks and use machines in besieging the city;\r\nand when they have gotten it, to overturn its very foundations, and to\r\ndestroy all those that are in it. Accordingly the messenger carried the\r\nking's message with which he was charged, and made haste to Joab. But\r\nBathsheba, the wife of Uriah, when she was informed of the death of her\r\nhusband, mourned for his death many days; and when her mourning was\r\nover, and the tears which she shed for Uriah were dried up, the king\r\ntook her to wife presently; and a son was born to him by her.\r\n\r\n3. With this marriage God was not well pleased, but was thereupon angry\r\nat David; and he appeared to Nathan the prophet in his sleep, and\r\ncomplained of the king. Now Nathan was a fair and prudent man; and\r\nconsidering that kings, when they fall into a passion, are guided more\r\nby that passion than they are by justice, he resolved to conceal the\r\nthreatenings that proceeded from God, and made a good-natured discourse\r\nto him, and this after the manner following:—He desired that the king\r\nwould give him his opinion in the following case:—\"There were,\" said he,\r\n\"two men inhabiting the same city, the one of them was rich, and [the\r\nother poor]. The rich man had a great many flocks of cattle, of sheep,\r\nand of kine; but the poor man had but one ewe lamb. This he brought up\r\nwith his children, and let her eat her food with them; and he had the\r\nsame natural affection for her which any one might have for a daughter.\r\nNow upon the coming of a stranger to the rich man, he would not\r\nvouchsafe to kill any of his own flocks, and thence feast his friend;\r\nbut he sent for the poor man's lamb, and took her away from him, and\r\nmade her ready for food, and thence feasted the stranger.\" This\r\ndiscourse troubled the king exceedingly; and he denounced to Nathan,\r\nthat \"this man was a wicked man who could dare to do such a thing; and\r\nthat it was but just that he should restore the lamb fourfold, and be\r\npunished with death for it also.\" Upon this Nathan immediately said that\r\nhe was himself the man who ought to suffer those punishments, and that\r\nby his own sentence; and that it was he who had perpetrated this 'great\r\nand horrid crime.' He also revealed to him, and laid before him, the\r\nanger of God against him, who had made him king over the army of the\r\nHebrews, and lord of all the nations, and those many and great nations\r\nround about him; who had formerly delivered him out of the hands of\r\nSaul, and had given him such wives as he had justly and legally married;\r\nand now this God was despised by him, and affronted by his impiety, when\r\nhe had married, and now had, another man's wife; and by exposing her\r\nhusband to the enemy, had really slain him; that God would inflict\r\npunishments upon him on account of those instances of wickedness; that\r\nhis own wives should be forced by one of his sons; and that he should be\r\ntreacherously supplanted by the same son; and that although he had\r\nperpetrated his wickedness secretly, yet should that punishment which he\r\nwas to undergo be inflicted publicly upon him; \"that, moreover,\" said\r\nhe, \"the child which was born to thee of her shall soon die.\" When the\r\nking was troubled at these messages, and sufficiently confounded, and\r\nsaid with tears and sorrow that he had sinned, [for he was without\r\ncontroversy a pious man, and guilty of no sin at all in his whole life,\r\nexcepting those in the matter of Uriah,] God had compassion on him, and\r\nwas reconciled to him, and promised that he would preserve to him both\r\nhis life and his kingdom; for he said that, seeing he repented of the\r\nthings he had done, he was no longer displeased with him. So Nathan,\r\nwhen he had delivered this prophecy to the king, returned home.\r\n\r\n4. However, God sent a dangerous distemper upon the child that was born\r\nto David of the wife of Uriah, at which the king was troubled, and did\r\nnot take any food for seven days, although his servants almost forced\r\nhim to take it; but he clothed himself in a black garment, and fell\r\ndown, and lay upon the ground in sackcloth, entrusting God for the\r\nrecovery of the child, for he vehemently loved the child's mother; but\r\nwhen, on the seventh day, the child was dead, the king's servants durst\r\nnot tell him of it, as supposing that when he knew it, he would still\r\nless admit of food, and other care of himself, by reason of his grief at\r\nthe death of his son, since when the child was only sick, he so greatly\r\nafflicted himself, and grieved for him: but when the king perceived that\r\nhis servants were in disorder, and seemed to be affected, as those who\r\nare very desirous to conceal something, he understood that the child was\r\ndead; and when he had called one of his servants to him, and discovered\r\nthat so it was, he arose up and washed himself, and took a white\r\ngarment, and came into the tabernacle of God. He also commanded them to\r\nset supper before him, and thereby greatly surprised his kindred and\r\nservants, while he did nothing of this when the child was sick, but did\r\nit all when he was dead. Whereupon having first begged leave to ask him\r\na question, they besought him to tell them the reason of this his\r\nconduct; he then called them unskillful people, and instructed them how\r\nhe had hopes of the recovery of the child while it was alive, and\r\naccordingly did all that was proper for him to do, as thinking by such\r\nmeans to render God propitious to him; but that when the child was dead,\r\nthere was no longer any occasion for grief, which was then to no\r\npurpose. When he had said this, they commended the king's wisdom and\r\nunderstanding. He then went in unto Bathsheba his wife, and she\r\nconceived and bare a son; and by the command of Nathan the prophet\r\ncalled his name Solomon.\r\n\r\n5. But Joab sorely distressed the Ammonites in the siege, by cutting off\r\ntheir waters, and depriving them of other means of subsistence, till\r\nthey were in the greatest want of meat and drink, for they depended only\r\non one small well of water, and this they durst not drink of too freely,\r\nlest the fountain should entirely fail them. So he wrote to the king,\r\nand informed him thereof; and persuaded him to come himself to take the\r\ncity, that he might have the honor of the victory. Upon this letter of\r\nJoab's, the king accepted of his good-will and fidelity, and took with\r\nhim his army, and came to the destruction of Rabbah; and when he had\r\ntaken it by force, he gave it to his soldiers to plunder it; but he\r\nhimself took the king of the Ammonites' crown, whose weight was a talent\r\nof gold; 13 and it had in its middle a precious stone called a sardonyx;\r\nwhich crown David ever after wore on his own head. He also found many\r\nother vessels in the city, and those both splendid and of great price;\r\nbut as for the men, he tormented them, 14 and then destroyed them; and\r\nwhen he had taken the other cities of the Ammonites by force, he treated\r\nthem after the same manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. How Absalom Murdered Amnon, Who Had Forced His Own Sister;\r\nAnd How He Was Banished And Afterwards Recalled By David.\r\n\r\n1. When the king was returned to Jerusalem, a sad misfortune befell his\r\nhouse, on the occasion following: He had a daughter, who was yet a\r\nvirgin, and very handsome, insomuch that she surpassed all the most\r\nbeautiful women; her name was Tamar; she had the same mother with\r\nAbsalom. Now Amnon, David's eldest son, fell in love with her, and being\r\nnot able to obtain his desires, on account of her virginity, and the\r\ncustody she was under, was so much out of order, nay, his grief so eat\r\nup his body, that he grew lean, and his color was changed. Now there was\r\none Jenadab, a kinsman and friend of his, who discovered this his\r\npassion, for he was an extraordinary wise man, and of great sagacity of\r\nmind. When, therefore, he saw that every morning Amnon was not in body\r\nas he ought to be, he came to him, and desired him to tell him what was\r\nthe cause of it: however, he said that he guessed that it arose from the\r\npassion of love. Amnon confessed his passion, that he was in love with a\r\nsister of his, who had the same father with himself. So Jenadab\r\nsuggested to him by what method and contrivance he might obtain his\r\ndesires; for he persuaded him to pretend sickness, and bade him, when\r\nhis father should come to him, to beg of him that his sister might come\r\nand minister to him; for if that were done, he should be better, and\r\nshould quickly recover from his distemper. So Amnon lay down on his bed,\r\nand pretended to be sick, as Jonadab had suggested. When his father\r\ncame, and inquired how he did, he begged of him to send his sister to\r\nhim. Accordingly, he presently ordered her to be brought to him; and\r\nwhen she was come, Amnon bade her make cakes for him, and fry them in a\r\npan, and do it all with her own hands, because he should take them\r\nbetter from her hand [than from any one's else]. So she kneaded the\r\nflour in the sight of her brother, and made him cakes, and baked them in\r\na pan, and brought them to him; but at that time he would not taste\r\nthem, but gave order to his servants to send all that were there out of\r\nhis chamber, because he had a mind to repose himself, free from tumult\r\nand disturbance. As soon as what he had commanded was done, he desired\r\nhis sister to bring his supper to him into the inner parlor; which, when\r\nthe damsel had done, he took hold of her, and endeavored to persuade her\r\nto lie with him. Whereupon the damsel cried out, and said, \"Nay,\r\nbrother, do not force me, nor be so wicked as to transgress the laws,\r\nand bring upon thyself the utmost confusion. Curb this thy unrighteous\r\nand impure lust, from which our house will get nothing but reproach and\r\ndisgrace.\" She also advised him to speak to his father about this\r\naffair; for he would permit him [to marry her]. This she said, as\r\ndesirous to avoid her brother's violent passion at present. But he would\r\nnot yield to her; but, inflamed with love and blinded with the vehemency\r\nof his passion, he forced his sister: but as soon as Amnon had satisfied\r\nhis lust, he hated her immediately, and giving her reproachful words,\r\nbade her rise up and be gone. And when she said that this was a more\r\ninjurious treatment than the former, if, now he had forced her, he would\r\nnot let her stay with him till the evening, but bid her go away in the\r\nday- time, and while it was light, that she might meet with people that\r\nwould be witnesses of her shame,—he commanded his servant to turn her\r\nout of his house. Whereupon she was sorely grieved at the injury and\r\nviolence that had been offered to her, and rent her loose coat, [for the\r\nvirgins of old time wore such loose coats tied at the hands, and let\r\ndown to the ankles, that the inner coats might not be seen,] and\r\nsprinkled ashes on her head; and went up the middle of the city, crying\r\nout and lamenting for the violence that had been offered her. Now\r\nAbsalom, her brother, happened to meet her, and asked her what sad thing\r\nhad befallen her, that she was in that plight; and when she had told him\r\nwhat injury had been offered her, he comforted her, and desired her to\r\nbe quiet, and take all patiently, and not to esteem her being corrupted\r\nby her brother as an injury. So she yielded to his advice, and left off\r\nher crying out, and discovering the force offered her to the multitude;\r\nand she continued as a widow with her brother Absalom a long time.\r\n\r\n2. When David his father knew this, he was grieved at the actions of\r\nAmnon; but because he had an extraordinary affection for him, for he was\r\nhis eldest son, he was compelled not to afflict him; but Absalom watched\r\nfor a fit opportunity of revenging this crime upon him, for he\r\nthoroughly hated him. Now the second year after this wicked affair about\r\nhis sister was over, and Absalom was about to go to shear his own sheep\r\nat Baalhazor, which is a city in the portion of Ephraim, he besought his\r\nfather, as well as his brethren, to come and feast with him: but when\r\nDavid excused himself, as not being willing to be burdensome to him,\r\nAbsalom desired he would however send his brethren; whom he did send\r\naccordingly. Then Absalom charged his own servants, that when they\r\nshould see Amnon disordered and drowsy with wine, and he should give\r\nthem a signal, they should fear nobody, but kill him.\r\n\r\n3. When they had done as they were commanded, the rest of his brethren\r\nwere astonished and disturbed, and were afraid for themselves, so they\r\nimmediately got on horseback, and rode away to their father; but\r\nsomebody there was who prevented them, and told their father they were\r\nall slain by Absalom; whereupon he was overcome with sorrow, as for so\r\nmany of his sons that were destroyed at once, and that by their brother\r\nalso; and by this consideration, that it was their brother that appeared\r\nto have slain them, he aggravated his sorrow for them. So he neither\r\ninquired what was the cause of this slaughter, nor staid to hear any\r\nthing else, which yet it was but reasonable to have done, when so very\r\ngreat, and by that greatness so incredible, a misfortune was related to\r\nhim: he rent his clothes and threw himself upon the ground, and there\r\nlay lamenting the loss of all his sons, both those who, as he was\r\ninformed, were slain, and of him who slew them. But Jonadab, the son of\r\nhis brother Shemeah, entreated him not to indulge his sorrow so far, for\r\nas to the rest of his sons he did not believe that they were slain, for\r\nhe found no cause for such a suspicion; but he said it might deserve\r\ninquiry as to Amnon, for it was not unlikely that Absalom might venture\r\nto kill him on account of the injury he had offered to Tamar. In the\r\nmean time, a great noise of horses, and a tumult of some people that\r\nwere coming, turned their attention to them; they were the king's sons,\r\nwho were fled away from the feast. So their father met them as they were\r\nin their grief, and he himself grieved with them; but it was more than\r\nhe expected to see those his sons again, whom he had a little before\r\nheard to have perished. However, their were tears on both sides; they\r\nlamenting their brother who was killed, and the king lamenting his son,\r\nwho was killed also; but Absalom fled to Geshur, to his grandfather by\r\nhis mother's side, who was king of that country, and he remained with\r\nhim three whole years.\r\n\r\n4. Now David had a design to send to Absalom, not that he should come to\r\nbe punished, but that he might be with him, for the effects of his anger\r\nwere abated by length of time. It was Joab, the captain of his host,\r\nthat chiefly persuaded him so to do; for he suborned an ordinary woman,\r\nthat was stricken in age, to go to the king in mourning apparel, who\r\nsaid thus to him:—That two of her sons, in a coarse way, had some\r\ndifference between them, and that in the progress of that difference\r\nthey came to an open quarrel, and that one was smitten by the other, and\r\nwas dead; and she desired him to interpose in this case, and to do her\r\nthe favor to save this her son from her kindred, who were very zealous\r\nto have him that had slain his brother put to death, that so she might\r\nnot be further deprived of the hopes she had of being taken care of in\r\nher old age by him; and that if he would hinder this slaughter of her\r\nson by those that wished for it, he would do her a great favor, because\r\nthe kindred would not be restrained from their purpose by any thing else\r\nthan by the fear of him. And when the king had given his consent to what\r\nthe woman had begged of him, she made this reply to him:—\"I owe thee\r\nthanks for thy benignity to me in pitying my old age, and preventing the\r\nloss of my only remaining child; but in order to assure me of this thy\r\nkindness, be first reconciled to thine own son, and cease to be angry\r\nwith him; for how shall I persuade myself that thou hast really bestowed\r\nthis favor upon me, while thou thyself continuest after the like manner\r\nin thy wrath to thine own son? for it is a foolish thing to add\r\nwillfully another to thy dead son, while the death of the other was\r\nbrought about without thy consent.\" And now the king perceived that this\r\npretended story was a subornation derived from Joab, and was of his\r\ncontrivance; and when, upon inquiry of the old woman, he understood it\r\nto be so in reality, he called for Joab, and told him he had obtained\r\nwhat he requested according to his own mind; and he bid him bring\r\nAbsalom back, for he was not now displeased, but had already ceased to\r\nbe angry with him. So Joab bowed himself down to the king, and took his\r\nwords kindly, and went immediately to Geshur, and took Absalom with him,\r\nand came to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n5. However, the king sent a message to his son beforehand, as he was\r\ncoming, and commanded him to retire to his own house, for he was not yet\r\nin such a disposition as to think fit at present to see him.\r\nAccordingly, upon the father's command, he avoided coming into his\r\npresence, and contented himself with the respects paid him by his own\r\nfamily only. Now his beauty was not impaired, either by the grief he had\r\nbeen under, or by the want of such care as was proper to be taken of a\r\nking's son, for he still surpassed and excelled all men in the tallness\r\nof his body, and was more eminent [in a fine appearance] than those that\r\ndieted the most luxuriously; and indeed such was the thickness of the\r\nhair of his head, that it was with difficulty that he was polled every\r\neighth day; and his hair weighed two hundred shekels 15 which are five\r\npounds. However, he dwelt in Jerusalem two years, and became the father\r\nof three sons, and one daughter; which daughter was of very great\r\nbeauty, and which Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, took to wife afterward,\r\nand had by her a son named Abijah. But Absalom sent to Joab, and desired\r\nhim to pacify his father entirely towards him; and to beseech him to\r\ngive him leave to come to him to see him, and speak with him. But when\r\nJoab neglected so to do, he sent some of his own servants, and set fire\r\nto the field adjoining to him; which, when Joab understood, he came to\r\nAbsalom, and accused him of what he had done; and asked him the reason\r\nwhy he did so. To which Absalom replied, that \"I have found out this\r\nstratagem that might bring thee to us, while thou hast taken no care to\r\nperform the injunction I laid upon thee, which was this, to reconcile my\r\nfather to me; and I really beg it of thee, now thou art here, to pacify\r\nmy father as to me, since I esteem my coming hither to be more grievous\r\nthan my banishment, while my father's wrath against me continues.\"\r\nHereby Joab was persuaded, and pitied the distress that Absalom was in,\r\nand became an intercessor with the king for him. And when he had\r\ndiscoursed with his father, he soon brought him to that amicable\r\ndisposition towards Absalom, that he presently sent for him to come to\r\nhim; and when he had cast himself down upon the ground, and had begged\r\nfor the forgiveness of his offenses, the king raised him up, and\r\npromised him to forget what he had formerly done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. Concerning The Insurrection Of Absalom Against David And\r\nConcerning Ahithophel And Hushai; And Concerning Ziba And Shimei; And\r\nHow Ahithophel Hanged Himself.\r\n\r\n1. Now Absalom, upon this his success with the king, procured to himself\r\na great many horses, and many chariots, and that in a little time also.\r\nHe had moreover fifty armor-bearers that were about him; and he came\r\nearly every day to the king's palace, and spake what was agreeable to\r\nsuch as came for justice and lost their causes, as if that happened for\r\nwant of good counselors about the king, or perhaps because the judges\r\nmistook in that unjust sentence they gave; whereby he gained the good-\r\nwill of them all. He told them, that had he but such authority committed\r\nto him, he would distribute justice to them in a most equitable manner.\r\nWhen he had made himself so popular among the multitude, he thought he\r\nhad already the good-will of the people secured to him; but when four\r\nyears 16 had passed since his father's reconciliation to him, he came to\r\nhim, and besought him to give him leave to go to Hebron, and pay a\r\nsacrifice to God, because he vowed it to him when he fled out of the\r\ncountry. So when David had granted his request, he went thither, and\r\ngreat multitudes came running together to him, for he had sent to a\r\ngreat number so to do.\r\n\r\n2. Among them came Ahithophel the Gilonite, a counsellor of David's, and\r\ntwo hundred men out of Jerusalem itself, who knew not his intentions,\r\nbut were sent for as to a sacrifice. So he was appointed king by all of\r\nthem, which he obtained by this stratagem. As soon as this news was\r\nbrought to David, and he was informed of what he did not expect from his\r\nson, he was affrighted at this his impious and bold undertaking, and\r\nwondered that he was so far from remembering how his offense had been so\r\nlately forgiven him, that he undertook much worse and more wicked\r\nenterprises; first, to deprive him of that kingdom which was given him\r\nof God; and secondly, to take away his own father's life. He therefore\r\nresolved to fly to the parts beyond Jordan: so he called his most\r\nintimate friends together, and communicated to them all that he had\r\nheard of his son's madness. He committed himself to God, to judge\r\nbetween them about all their actions; and left the care of his royal\r\npalace to his ten concubines, and went away from Jerusalem, being\r\nwillingly accompanied by the rest of the multitude, who went hastily\r\naway with him, and particularly by those six hundred armed men, who had\r\nbeen with him from his first flight in the days of Saul. But he\r\npersuaded Abiathar and Zadok, the high priests, who had determined to go\r\naway with him, as also all the Levites, who were with the ark, to stay\r\nbehind, as hoping that God would deliver him without its removal; but he\r\ncharged them to let him know privately how all things went on; and he\r\nhad their sons, Ahimmaz the son of Zadok, and Jonathan the son of\r\nAbiathar, for faithful ministers in all things; but Ittai the Gitrite\r\nwent out with him whether David would let him or not, for he would have\r\npersuaded him to stay, and on that account he appeared the more friendly\r\nto him. But as he was ascending the Mount of Olives barefooted, and all\r\nhis company were in tears, it was told him that Ahithophel was with\r\nAbsalom, and was of his side. This hearing augmented his grief; and he\r\nbesought God earnestly to alienate the mind of Absalom from Ahithophel,\r\nfor he was afraid that he should persuade him to follow his pernicious\r\ncounsel, for he was a prudent man, and very sharp in seeing what was\r\nadvantageous. When David was gotten upon the top of the mountain, he\r\ntook a view of the city; and prayed to God with abundance of tears, as\r\nhaving already lost his kingdom; and here it was that a faithful friend\r\nof his, whose name was Hushai, met him. When David saw him with his\r\nclothes rent, and having ashes all over his head, and in lamentation for\r\nthe great change of affairs, he comforted him, and exhorted him to leave\r\noff grieving; nay, at length he besought him to go back to Absalom, and\r\nappear as one of his party, and to fish out the secretest counsels of\r\nhis mind, and to contradict the counsels of Ahithophel, for that he\r\ncould not do him so much good by being with him as he might by being\r\nwith Absalom. So he was prevailed on by David, and left him, and came to\r\nJerusalem, whither Absalom himself came also a little while afterward.\r\n\r\n3. When David was gone a little farther, there met him Ziba, the servant\r\nof Mephibosheth, [whom he had sent to take care of the possessions which\r\nhad been given him, as the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,] with a\r\ncouple of asses, loaden with provisions, and desired him to take as much\r\nof them as he and his followers stood in need of. And when the king\r\nasked him where he had left Mephibosheth, he said he had left him in\r\nJerusalem, expecting to be chosen king in the present confusions, in\r\nremembrance of the benefits Saul had conferred upon them. At this the\r\nking had great indignation, and gave to Ziba all that he had formerly\r\nbestowed on Mephibosheth; for he determined that it was much fitter that\r\nhe should have them than the other; at which Ziba greatly rejoiced.\r\n\r\n4. When David was at Bahurim, a place so called, there came out a\r\nkinsman of Saul's, whose name was Shimei, and threw stones at him, and\r\ngave him reproachful words; and as his friends stood about the king and\r\nprotected him, he persevered still more in his reproaches, and called\r\nhim a bloody man, and the author of all sorts of mischief. He bade him\r\nalso go out of the land as an impure and accursed wretch; and he thanked\r\nGod for depriving him of his kingdom, and causing him to be punished for\r\nwhat injuries he had done to his master [Saul], and this by the means of\r\nhis own son. Now when they were all provoked against him, and angry at\r\nhim, and particularly Abishai, who had a mind to kill Shimei, David\r\nrestrained his anger. \"Let us not,\" said he, \"bring upon ourselves\r\nanother fresh misfortune to those we have already, for truly I have not\r\nthe least regard nor concern for this dog that raves at me: I submit\r\nmyself to God, by whose permission this man treats me in such a wild\r\nmanner; nor is it any wonder that I am obliged to undergo these abuses\r\nfrom him, while I experience the like from an impious son of my own; but\r\nperhaps God will have some commiseration upon us; if it be his will we\r\nshall overcome them.\" So he went on his way without troubling himself\r\nwith Shimei, who ran along the other side of the mountain, and threw out\r\nhis abusive language plentifully. But when David was come to Jordan, he\r\nallowed those that were with him to refresh themselves; for they were\r\nweary.\r\n\r\n5. But when Absalom, and Ahithophel his counselor, were come to\r\nJerusalem, with all the people, David's friend, Hushai, came to them;\r\nand when he had worshipped Absalom, he withal wished that his kingdom\r\nmight last a long time, and continue for all ages. But when Absalom said\r\nto him, \"How comes this, that he who was so intimate a friend of my\r\nfather's, and appeared faithful to him in all things, is not with him\r\nnow, but hath left him, and is come over to me?\" Hushai's answer was\r\nvery pertinent and prudent; for he said, \"We ought to follow God and the\r\nmultitude of the people; while these, therefore, my lord and master, are\r\nwith thee, it is fit that I should follow them, for thou hast received\r\nthe kingdom from God. I will therefore, if thou believest me to be thy\r\nfriend, show the same fidelity and kindness to thee, which thou knowest\r\nI have shown to thy father; nor is there any reason to be in the least\r\ndissatisfied with the present state of affairs, for the kingdom is not\r\ntransferred into another, but remains still in the same family, by the\r\nson's receiving it after his father.\" This speech persuaded Absalom, who\r\nbefore suspected Hushai. And now he called Ahithophel, and consulted\r\nwith him what he ought to do: he persuaded him to go in unto his\r\nfather's concubines; for he said that \"by this action the people would\r\nbelieve that thy difference with thy father is irreconcilable, and will\r\nthence fight with great alacrity against thy father, for hitherto they\r\nare afraid of taking up open enmity against him, out of an expectation\r\nthat you will be reconciled again.\" Accordingly, Absalom was prevailed\r\non by this advice, and commanded his servants to pitch him a tent upon\r\nthe top of the royal palace, in the sight of the multitude; and he went\r\nin and lay with his father's concubines. Now this came to pass according\r\nto the prediction of Nathan, when he prophesied and signified to him\r\nthat his son would rise up in rebellion against him.\r\n\r\n6. And when Absalom had done what he was advised to by Ahithophel, he\r\ndesired his advice, in the second place, about the war against his\r\nfather. Now Ahithophel only asked him to let him have ten thousand\r\nchosen men, and he promised he would slay his father, and bring the\r\nsoldiers back again in safety; and he said that then the kingdom would\r\nbe firm to him when David was dead [but not otherwise]. Absalom was\r\npleased with this advice, and called for Hushai, David's friend [for so\r\ndid he style him]; and informing him of the opinion of Ahithophel, he\r\nasked, further, what was his opinion concerning that matter. Now he was\r\nsensible that if Ahithophel's counsel were followed, David would be in\r\ndanger of being seized on, and slain; so he attempted to introduce a\r\ncontrary opinion, and said, \"Thou art not unacquainted, O king, with the\r\nvalor of thy father, and of those that are now with him; that he hath\r\nmade many wars, and hath always come off with victory, though probably\r\nhe now abides in the camp, for he is very skillful in stratagems, and in\r\nforeseeing the deceitful tricks of his enemies; yet will he leave his\r\nown soldiers in the evening, and will either hide himself in some\r\nvalley, or will place an ambush at some rock; so that when our army\r\njoins battle with him, his soldiers will retire for a little while, but\r\nwill come upon us again, as encouraged by the king's being near them;\r\nand in the mean time your father will show himself suddenly in the time\r\nof the battle, and will infuse courage into his own people when they are\r\nin danger, but bring consternation to thine. Consider, therefore, my\r\nadvice, and reason upon it, and if thou canst not but acknowledge it to\r\nbe the best, reject the opinion of Ahithophel. Send to the entire\r\ncountry of the Hebrews, and order them to come and fight with thy\r\nfather; and do thou thyself take the army, and be thine own general in\r\nthis war, and do not trust its management to another; then expect to\r\nconquer him with ease, when thou overtakest him openly with his few\r\npartisans, but hast thyself many ten thousands, who will be desirous to\r\ndemonstrate to thee their diligence and alacrity. And if thy father\r\nshall shut himself up in some city, and bear a siege, we will overthrow\r\nthat city with machines of war, and by undermining it.\" When Hushai had\r\nsaid this, he obtained his point against Ahithophel, for his opinion was\r\npreferred by Absalom before the other's: however, it was no other than\r\nGod 17 who made the counsel of Hushai appear best to the mind of\r\nAbsalom.\r\n\r\n7. So Hushai made haste to the high priests, Zadok and Abiathar, and\r\ntold them the opinion of Ahithophel, and his own, and that the\r\nresolution was taken to follow this latter advice. He therefore bade\r\nthem send to David, and tell him of it, and to inform him of the\r\ncounsels that had been taken; and to desire him further to pass quickly\r\nover Jordan, lest his son should change his mind, and make haste to\r\npursue him, and so prevent him, and seize upon him before he be in\r\nsafety. Now the high priests had their sons concealed in a proper place\r\nout of the city, that they might carry news to David of what was\r\ntransacted. Accordingly, they sent a maid-servant, whom they could\r\ntrust, to them, to carry the news of Absalom's counsels, and ordered\r\nthem to signify the same to David with all speed. So they made no excuse\r\nnor delay, but taking along with them their fathers' injunctions,\r\nbecause pious and faithful ministers, and judging that quickness and\r\nsuddenness was the best mark of faithful service, they made haste to\r\nmeet with David. But certain horsemen saw them when they were two\r\nfurlongs from the city, and informed Absalom of them, who immediately\r\nsent some to take them; but when the sons of the high priest perceived\r\nthis, they went out of the road, and betook themselves to a certain\r\nvillage; that village was called Bahurim; there they desired a certain\r\nwoman to hide them, and afford them security. Accordingly she let the\r\nyoung men down by a rope into a well, and laid fleeces of wool over\r\nthem; and when those that pursued them came to her, and asked her\r\nwhether she saw them, she did not deny that she had seen them, for that\r\nthey staid with her some time, but she said they then went their ways;\r\nand she foretold that, however, if they would follow them directly, they\r\nwould catch them; but when after a long pursuit they could not catch\r\nthem, they came back again; and when the woman saw those men were\r\nreturned, and that there was no longer any fear of the young men's being\r\ncaught by them, she drew them up by the rope, and bade them go on their\r\njourney accordingly, they used great diligence in the prosecution of\r\nthat journey, and came to David, and informed him accurately of all the\r\ncounsels of Absalom. So he commanded those that were with him to pass\r\nover Jordan while it was night, and not to delay at all on that account.\r\n\r\n8. But Ahithophel, on rejection of his advice, got upon his ass, and\r\nrode away to his own country, Gilon; and, calling his family together,\r\nhe told them distinctly what advice he had given Absalom; and since he\r\nhad not been persuaded by it, he said he would evidently perish, and\r\nthis in no long time, and that David would overcome him, and return to\r\nhis kingdom again; so he said it was better that he should take his own\r\nlife away with freedom and magnanimity, than expose himself to be\r\npunished by David, in opposition to whom he had acted entirely for\r\nAbsalom. When he had discoursed thus to them, he went into the inmost\r\nroom of his house, and hanged himself; and thus was the death of\r\nAhithophel, who was self-condemned; and when his relations had taken him\r\ndown from the halter, they took care of his funeral. Now, as for David,\r\nhe passed over Jordan, as we have said already, and came to Mahanaim,\r\nevery fine and very strong city; and all the chief men of the country\r\nreceived him with great pleasure, both out of the shame they had that he\r\nshould be forced to flee away [from Jerusalem], and out of the respect\r\nthey bare him while he was in his former prosperity. These were\r\nBarzillai the Gileadite, and Siphar the ruler among the Ammonites, and\r\nMachir the principal man of Gilead; and these furnished him with\r\nplentiful provisions for himself and his followers, insomuch that they\r\nwanted no beds nor blankets for them, nor loaves of bread, nor wine;\r\nnay, they brought them a great many cattle for slaughter, and afforded\r\nthem what furniture they wanted for their refreshment when they were\r\nweary, and for food, with plenty of other necessaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. How, When Absalom Was Beaten, He Was Caught In A Tree By His\r\nHair And Was Slain\r\n\r\n1. And this was the state of David and his followers: but Absalom got\r\ntogether a vast army of the Hebrews to oppose his father, and passed\r\ntherewith over the river Jordan, and sat down not far off Mahanaim, in\r\nthe country of Gilead. He appointed Amasa to be captain of all his host,\r\ninstead of Joab his kinsman: his father was Ithra and his mother\r\nAbigail: now she and Zeruiah, the mother of Joab, were David's sisters.\r\nBut when David had numbered his followers, and found them to be about\r\nfour thousand, he resolved not to tarry till Absalom attacked him, but\r\nset over his men captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and\r\ndivided his army into three parts; the one part he committed to Joab,\r\nthe next to Abishai, Joab's brother, and the third to Ittai, David's\r\ncompanion and friend, but one that came from the city Gath; and when he\r\nwas desirous of fighting himself among them, his friends would not let\r\nhim: and this refusal of theirs was founded upon very wise reasons:\r\n\"For,\" said they, \"if we be conquered when he is with us, we have lost\r\nall good hopes of recovering ourselves; but if we should be beaten in\r\none part of our army, the other parts may retire to him, and may thereby\r\nprepare a greater force, while the enemy will naturally suppose that he\r\nhath another army with him.\" So David was pleased with this their\r\nadvice, and resolved himself to tarry at Mahanaim; and as he sent his\r\nfriends and commanders to the battle, he desired them to show all\r\npossible alacrity and fidelity, and to bear in mind what advantages they\r\nhad received from him, which, though they had not been very great, yet\r\nhad they not been quite inconsiderable; and he begged of them to spare\r\nthe young man Absalom, lest some mischief should befall himself, if he\r\nshould be killed; and thus did he send out his army to the battle, and\r\nwished them victory therein.\r\n\r\n2. Then did Joab put his army in battle-array over against the enemy in\r\nthe Great Plain, where he had a wood behind him. Absalom also brought\r\nhis army into the field to oppose him. Upon the joining of the battle,\r\nboth sides showed great actions with their hands and their boldness; the\r\none side exposing themselves to the greatest hazards, and using their\r\nutmost alacrity, that David might recover his kingdom; and the other\r\nbeing no way deficient, either in doing or suffering, that Absalom might\r\nnot be deprived of that kingdom, and be brought to punishment by his\r\nfather for his impudent attempt against him. Those also that were the\r\nmost numerous were solicitous that they might not be conquered by those\r\nfew that were with Joab, and with the other commanders, because that\r\nwould be the greater disgrace to them; while David's soldiers strove\r\ngreatly to overcome so many ten thousands as the enemy had with them.\r\nNow David's men were conquerors, as superior in strength and skill in\r\nwar; so they followed the others as they fled away through the forests\r\nand valleys; some they took prisoners, and many they slew, and more in\r\nthe flight than in the battle for there fell about twenty thousand that\r\nday. But all David's men ran violently upon Absalom, for he was easily\r\nknown by his beauty and tallness. He was himself also afraid lest his\r\nenemies should seize on him, so he got upon the king's mule, and fled;\r\nbut as he was carried with violence, and noise, and a great motion, as\r\nbeing himself light, he entangled his hair greatly in the large boughs\r\nof a knotty tree that spread a great way, and there he hung, after a\r\nsurprising manner; and as for the beast, it went on farther, and that\r\nswiftly, as if his master had been still upon his back; but he, hanging\r\nin the air upon the boughs, was taken by his enemies. Now when one of\r\nDavid's soldiers saw this, he informed Joab of it; and when the general\r\nsaid, that if he had shot at and killed Absalom, he would have given him\r\nfifty shekels,—he replied, \"I would not have killed my master's son if\r\nthou wouldst have given me a thousand shekels, especially when he\r\ndesired that the young man might be spared in the hearing of us all.\"\r\nBut Joab bade him show him where it was that he saw Absalom hang;\r\nwhereupon he shot him to the heart, and slew him, and Joab's armor-\r\nbearers stood round the tree, and pulled down his dead body, and cast it\r\ninto a great chasm that was out of sight, and laid a heap of stones upon\r\nhim, till the cavity was filled up, and had both the appearance and the\r\nbigness of a grave. Then Joab sounded a retreat, and recalled his own\r\nsoldiers from pursuing the enemy's army, in order to spare their\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n3. Now Absalom had erected for himself a marble pillar in the king's\r\ndale, two furlongs distant from Jerusalem, which he named Absalom's\r\nHand, saying, that if his children were killed, his name would remain by\r\nthat pillar; for he had three sons and one daughter, named Tamar, as we\r\nsaid before, who when she was married to David's grandson, Rehoboam,\r\nbare a son, Abijah by name, who succeeded his father in the kingdom; but\r\nof these we shall speak in a part of our history which will be more\r\nproper. After the death of Absalom, they returned every one to their own\r\nhomes respectively.\r\n\r\n4. But now Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok the high priest, went to Joab, and\r\ndesired he would permit him to go and tell David of this victory, and to\r\nbring him the good news that God had afforded his assistance and his\r\nprovidence to him. However, he did not grant his request, but said to\r\nhim, \"Wilt thou, who hast always been the messenger of good news, now go\r\nand acquaint the king that his son is dead?\" So he desired him to\r\ndesist. He then called Cushi, and committed the business to him, that he\r\nshould tell the king what he had seen. But when Ahimaaz again desired\r\nhim to let him go as a messenger, and assured him that he would only\r\nrelate what concerned the victory, but not concerning the death of\r\nAbsalom, he gave him leave to go to David. Now he took a nearer road\r\nthan the former did, for nobody knew it but himself, and he came before\r\nCushi. Now as David was sitting between the gates, 18 and waiting to see\r\nwhen somebody would come to him from the battle, and tell him how it\r\nwent, one of the watchmen saw Ahimaaz running, and before he could\r\ndiscern who he was, he told David that he saw somebody coming to him,\r\nwho said he was a good messenger. A little while after, he informed him\r\nthat another messenger followed him; whereupon the king said that he\r\nalso was a good messenger: but when the watchman saw Ahimaaz, and that\r\nhe was already very near, he gave the king notice that it was the son of\r\nZadok the high priest who came running. So David was very glad, and said\r\nhe was a messenger of good tidings, and brought him some such news from\r\nthe battle as he desired to hear.\r\n\r\n5. While the king was saying thus, Ahimaaz appeared, and worshipped the\r\nking. And when the king inquired of him about the battle, he said he\r\nbrought him the good news of victory and dominion. And when he inquired\r\nwhat he had to say concerning his son, he said that he came away on the\r\nsudden as soon as the enemy was defeated, but that he heard a great\r\nnoise of those that pursued Absalom, and that he could learn no more,\r\nbecause of the haste he made when Joab sent him to inform him of the\r\nvictory. But when Cushi was come, and had worshipped him, and informed\r\nhim of the victory, he asked him about his son, who replied, \"May the\r\nlike misfortune befall thine enemies as hath befallen Absalom.\" That\r\nword did not permit either himself or his soldiers to rejoice for the\r\nvictory, though it was a very great one; but David went up to the\r\nhighest part of the city, 19 and wept for his son, and beat his breast,\r\ntearing [the hair of] his head, tormenting himself all manner of ways,\r\nand crying out, \"O my son! I wish that I had died myself, and ended my\r\ndays with thee!\" for he was of a tender natural affection, and had\r\nextraordinary compassion for this son in particular. But when the army\r\nand Joab heard that the king mourned for his son, they were ashamed to\r\nenter the city in the habit of conquerors, but they all came in as cast\r\ndown, and in tears, as if they had been beaten. Now while the king\r\ncovered himself, and grievously lamented his son, Joab went in to him,\r\nand comforted him, and said, \"O my lord the king, thou art not aware\r\nthat thou layest a blot on thyself by what thou now doest; for thou\r\nseemest to hate those that love thee, and undergo dangers for thee nay,\r\nto hate thyself and thy family, and to love those that are thy bitter\r\nenemies, and to desire the company of those that are no more, and who\r\nhave been justly slain; for had Absalom gotten the victory, and firmly\r\nsettled himself in the kingdom, there had been none of us left alive,\r\nbut all of us, beginning with thyself and thy children, had miserably\r\nperished, while our enemies had not wept for his, but rejoiced over us,\r\nand punished even those that pitied us in our misfortunes; and thou art\r\nnot ashamed to do this in the case of one that has been thy bitter\r\nenemy, who, while he was thine own son hath proved so wicked to thee.\r\nLeave off, therefore, thy unreasonable grief, and come abroad and be\r\nseen of thy soldiers, and return them thanks for the alacrity they\r\nshowed in the fight; for I myself will this day persuade the people to\r\nleave thee, and to give the kingdom to another, if thou continuest to do\r\nthus; and then I shall make thee to grieve bitterly and in earnest.\"\r\nUpon Joab's speaking thus to him, he made the king leave off his sorrow,\r\nand brought him to the consideration of his affairs. So David changed\r\nhis habit, and exposed himself in a manner fit to be seen by the\r\nmultitude, and sat at the gates; whereupon all the people heard of it,\r\nand ran together to him, and saluted him. And this was the present state\r\nof David's affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. How David, When He Had Recovered His Kingdom, Was Reconciled\r\nTo Shimei, And To Ziba; And Showed A Great Affection To Barzillai; And\r\nHow, Upon The Rise Of A Sedition, He Made Amasa Captain Of His Host, In\r\nOrder To Pursue Seba; Which Amasa Was Slain By Joab.\r\n\r\n1. Now those Hebrews that had been With Absalom, and had retired out of\r\nthe battle, when they were all returned home, sent messengers to every\r\ncity to put them in mind of what benefits David had bestowed upon them,\r\nand of that liberty which he had procured them, by delivering them from\r\nmany and great wars. But they complained, that whereas they had ejected\r\nhim out of his kingdom, and committed it to another governor, which\r\nother governor, whom they had set up, was already dead, they did not now\r\nbeseech David to leave off his anger at them, and to become friends with\r\nthem, and, as he used to do, to resume the care of their affairs, and\r\ntake the kingdom again. This was often told to David. And, this\r\nnotwithstanding, David sent to Zadok and Abiathar the high priests, that\r\nthey should speak to the rulers of the tribe of Judah after the manner\r\nfollowing: That it would be a reproach upon them to permit the other\r\ntribes to choose David for their king before their tribe, \"and this,\"\r\nsaid he, \"while you are akin to him, and of the same common blood.\" He\r\ncommanded them also to say the same to Amasa the captain of their\r\nforces, That whereas he was his sister's son, he had not persuaded the\r\nmultitude to restore the kingdom to David; that he might expect from him\r\nnot only a reconciliation, for that was already granted, but that\r\nsupreme command of the army also which Absalom had bestowed upon him.\r\nAccordingly the high priests, when they had discoursed with the rulers\r\nof the tribe, and said what the king had ordered them, persuaded Amasa\r\nto undertake the care of his affairs. So he persuaded that tribe to send\r\nimmediately ambassadors to him, to beseech him to return to his own\r\nkingdom. The same did all the Israelites, at the like persuasion of\r\nAmasa.\r\n\r\n2. When the ambassadors came to him, he came to Jerusalem; and the tribe\r\nof Judah was the first that came to meet the king at the river Jordan.\r\nAnd Shimei, the son of Gera, came with a thousand men, which he brought\r\nwith him out of the tribe of Benjamin; and Ziba, the freed-man of Saul,\r\nwith his sons, fifteen in number, and with his twenty servants. All\r\nthese, as well as the tribe of Judah, laid a bridge [of boats] over the\r\nriver, that the king, and those that were with him, might with ease pass\r\nover it. Now as soon as he was come to Jordan, the tribe of Judah\r\nsaluted him. Shimei also came upon the bridge, and took hold of his\r\nfeet, and prayed him to forgive him what he had offended, and not to be\r\ntoo bitter against him, nor to think fit to make him the first example\r\nof severity under his new authority; but to consider that he had\r\nrepented of his failure of duty, and had taken care to come first of all\r\nto him. While he was thus entreating the king, and moving him to\r\ncompassion, Abishai, Joab's brother, said, \"And shall not this man die\r\nfor this, that he hath cursed that king whom God hath appointed to reign\r\nover us?\" But David turned himself to him, and said, \"Will you never\r\nleave off, ye sons of Zeruiah? Do not you, I pray, raise new troubles\r\nand seditions among us, now the former are over; for I would not have\r\nyou ignorant that I this day begin my reign, and therefore swear to\r\nremit to all offenders their punishments, and not to animadvert on any\r\none that has sinned. Be thou, therefore,\" said he, \"O Shimei, of good\r\ncourage, and do not at all fear being put to death.\" So he worshipped\r\nhim, and went on before him.\r\n\r\n3. Mephibosheth also, Saul's grandson, met David, clothed in a sordid\r\ngarment, and having his hair thick and neglected; for after David was\r\nfled away, he was in such grief that he had not polled his head, nor had\r\nhe washed his clothes, as dooming himself to undergo such hardships upon\r\noccasion of the change-of the king's affairs. Now he had been unjustly\r\ncalumniated to the king by Ziba, his steward. When he had saluted the\r\nking, and worshipped him, the king began to ask him why he did not go\r\nout of Jerusalem with him, and accompany him during his flight. He\r\nreplied, that this piece of injustice was owing to Ziba; because, when\r\nhe was ordered to get things ready for his going out with him, he took\r\nno care of it, but regarded him no more than if he had been a slave;\r\n\"and, indeed, had I had my feet sound and strong, I had not deserted\r\nthee, for I could then have made use of them in my flight: but this is\r\nnot all the injury that Ziba has done me, as to my duty to thee, my lord\r\nand master, but he hath calumniated me besides, and told lies about me\r\nof his own invention; but I know thy mind will not admit of such\r\ncalumnies, but is righteously disposed, and a lover of truth, which it\r\nis also the will of God should prevail. For when thou wast in the\r\ngreatest danger of suffering by my grandfather, and when, on that\r\naccount, our whole family might justly have been destroyed, thou wast\r\nmoderate and merciful, and didst then especially forget all those\r\ninjuries, when, if thou hadst remembered them, thou hadst the power of\r\npunishing us for them; but thou hast judged me to be thy friend, and\r\nhast set me every day at thine own table; nor have I wanted any thing\r\nwhich one of thine own kinsmen, of greatest esteem with thee, could have\r\nexpected.\" When he had said this, David resolved neither to punish\r\nMephibosheth, nor to condemn Ziba, as having belied his master; but said\r\nto him, that as he had [before] granted all his estate to Ziba, because\r\nhe did not come along with him, so he [now] promised to forgive him, and\r\nordered that the one half of his estate should be restored to him. 20\r\nWhereupon Mephibosheth said, \"Nay, let Ziba take all; it suffices me\r\nthat thou hast recovered thy kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n4. But David desired Barzillai the Gileadite, that great and good man,\r\nand one that had made a plentiful provision for him at Mahanaim, and had\r\nconducted him as far as Jordan, to accompany him to Jerusalem, for he\r\npromised to treat him in his old age with all manner of respect—to take\r\ncare of him, and provide for him. But Barzillai was so desirous to live\r\nat home, that he entreated him to excuse him from attendance on him; and\r\nsaid that his age was too great to enjoy the pleasures [of a court,]\r\nsince he was fourscore years old, and was therefore making provision for\r\nhis death and burial: so he desired him to gratify him in this request,\r\nand dismiss him; for he had no relish of his meat, or his drink, by\r\nreason of his age; and that his ears were too much shut up to hear the\r\nsound of pipes, or the melody of other musical instruments, such as all\r\nthose that live with kings delight in. When he entreated for this so\r\nearnestly, the king said, \"I dismiss thee, but thou shalt grant me thy\r\nson Chimham, and upon him I will bestow all sorts of good things.\" So\r\nBarzillai left his son with him, and worshipped the king, and wished him\r\na prosperous conclusion of all his affairs according to his own mind,\r\nand then returned home; but David came to Gilgal, having about him half\r\nthe people [of Israel], and the [whole] tribe of Judah.\r\n\r\n5. Now the principal men of the country came to Gilgal to him with a\r\ngreat multitude, and complained of the tribe of Judah, that they had\r\ncome to him in a private manner; whereas they ought all conjointly, and\r\nwith one and the same intention, to have given him the meeting. But the\r\nrulers of the tribe of Judah desired them not to be displeased, if they\r\nhad been prevented by them; for, said they, \"We are David's kinsmen, and\r\non that account we the rather took care of him, and loved him, and so\r\ncame first to him;\" yet had they not, by their early coming, received\r\nany gifts from him, which might give them who came last any uneasiness.\r\nWhen the rulers of the tribe of Judah had said this, the rulers of the\r\nother tribes were not quiet, but said further, \"O brethren, we cannot\r\nbut wonder at you when you call the king your kinsman alone, whereas he\r\nthat hath received from God the power over all of us in common ought to\r\nbe esteemed a kinsman to us all; for which reason the whole people have\r\neleven parts in him, and you but one part 21 we are also elder than you;\r\nwherefore you have not done justly in coming to the king in this private\r\nand concealed manner.\"\r\n\r\n6. While these rulers were thus disputing one with another, a certain\r\nwicked man, who took a pleasure in seditious practices, [his name was\r\nSheba, the son of Bichri, of the tribe of Benjamin,] stood up in the\r\nmidst of the multitude, and cried aloud, and spake thus to them: \"We\r\nhave no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jesse.\" And when he\r\nhad used those words, he blew with a trumpet, and declared war against\r\nthe king; and they all left David, and followed him; the tribe of Judah\r\nalone staid with him, and settled him in his royal palace at Jerusalem.\r\nBut as for his concubines, with whom Absalom his son had accompanied,\r\ntruly he removed them to another house, and ordered those that had the\r\ncare of them to make a plentiful provision for them, but he came not\r\nnear them any more. He also appointed Amasa for the captain of his\r\nforces, and gave him the same high office which Joab before had; and he\r\ncommanded him to gather together, out of the tribe of Judah, as great an\r\narmy as he could, and come to him within three days, that he might\r\ndeliver to him his entire army, and might send him to fight against\r\n[Sheba] the son of Bichri. Now while Amasa was gone out, and made some\r\ndelay in gathering the army together, and so was not yet returned, on\r\nthe third day the king said to Joab, \"It is not fit we should make any\r\ndelay in this affair of Sheba, lest he get a numerous army about him,\r\nand be the occasion of greater mischief, and hurt our affairs more than\r\ndid Absalom himself; do not thou therefore wait any longer, but take\r\nsuch forces as thou hast at hand, and that [old] body of six hundred\r\nmen, and thy brother Abishai, with thee, and pursue after our enemy, and\r\nendeavor to fight him wheresoever thou canst overtake him. Make haste to\r\nprevent him, lest he seize upon some fenced cities, and cause us great\r\nlabor and pains before we take him.\"\r\n\r\n7. So Joab resolved to make no delay, but taking with him his brother,\r\nand those six hundred men, and giving orders that the rest of the army\r\nwhich was at Jerusalem should follow him, he marched with great speed\r\nagainst Sheba; and when he was come to Gibeon, which is a village forty\r\nfurlongs distant from Jerusalem, Amasa brought a great army with him,\r\nand met Joab. Now Joab was girded with a sword, and his breastplate on;\r\nand when Amasa came near him to salute him, he took particular care that\r\nhis sword should fall out, as it were, of its own accord: so he took it\r\nup from the ground, and while he approached Amasa, who was then near\r\nhim, as though he would kiss him, he took hold of Amasa's beard with his\r\nother hand, and he smote him in his belly when he did not foresee it,\r\nand slew him. This impious and altogether profane action Joab did to a\r\ngood young man, and his kinsman, and one that had done him no injury,\r\nand this out of jealousy that he would obtain the chief command of the\r\narmy, and be in equal dignity with himself about the king; and for the\r\nsame cause it was that he killed Abner. But as to that former wicked\r\naction, the death of his brother Asahel, which he seemed to revenge,\r\nafforded him a decent pretense, and made that crime a pardonable one;\r\nbut in this murder of Amasa there was no such covering for it. Now when\r\nJoab had killed this general, he pursued after Sheba, having left a man\r\nwith the dead body, who was ordered to proclaim aloud to the army, that\r\nAmasa was justly slain, and deservedly punished. \"But,\" said he, \"if you\r\nbe for the king, follow Joab his general, and Abishai, Joab's brother:\"\r\nbut because the body lay on the road, and all the multitude came running\r\nto it, and, as is usual with the multitude, stood wondering a great\r\nwhile at it, he that guarded it removed it thence, and carried it to a\r\ncertain place that was very remote from the road, and there laid it, and\r\ncovered it with his garment. When this was done, all the people followed\r\nJoab. Now as he pursued Sheba through all the country of Israel, one\r\ntold him that he was in a strong city, called Abelbeth-maachah. Hereupon\r\nJoab went thither, and set about it with his army, and cast up a bank\r\nround it, and ordered his soldiers to undermine the walls, and to\r\noverthrow them; and since the people in the city did not admit him, he\r\nwas greatly displeased at them.\r\n\r\n8. Now there was a woman of small account, and yet both wise and\r\nintelligent, who seeing her native city lying at the last extremity,\r\nascended upon the wall, and, by means of the armed men, called for Joab;\r\nand when he came to her, she began to say, That \"God ordained kings and\r\ngenerals of armies, that they might cut off the enemies of the Hebrews,\r\nand introduce a universal peace among them; but thou art endeavoring to\r\noverthrow and depopulate a metropolis of the Israelites, which hath been\r\nguilty of no offense.\" But he replied, \"God continue to be merciful unto\r\nme: I am disposed to avoid killing any one of the people, much less\r\nwould I destroy such a city as this; and if they will deliver me up\r\nSheba, the son of Bichri, who hath rebelled against the king, I will\r\nleave off the siege, and withdraw the army from the place.\" Now as soon\r\nas the woman heard what Joab said, she desired him to intermit the siege\r\nfor a little while, for that he should have the head of his enemy thrown\r\nout to him presently. So she went down to the citizens, and said to\r\nthem, \"Will you be so wicked as to perish miserably, with your children\r\nand wives, for the sake of a vile fellow, and one whom nobody knows who\r\nhe is? And will you have him for your king instead of David, who hath\r\nbeen so great a benefactor to you, and oppose your city alone to such a\r\nmighty and strong army?\" So she prevailed with them, and they cut off\r\nthe head of Sheba, and threw it into Joab's army. When this was done,\r\nthe king's general sounded a retreat, and raised the siege. And when he\r\nwas come to Jerusalem, he was again appointed to be general of all the\r\npeople. The king also constituted Benaiah captain of the guards, and of\r\nthe six hundred men. He also set Adoram over the tribute, and Sabathes\r\nand Achilaus over the records. He made Sheva the scribe, and appointed\r\nZadok and Abiathar the high priests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. How The Hebrews Were Delivered From A Famine When The\r\nGibeonites Had Caused Punishment To Be Inflicted For Those Of Them That\r\nHad Been Slain: As Also, What Great Actions Were Performed Against The\r\nPhilistines By David, And The Men Of Valor About Him.\r\n\r\n1. After this, when the country was greatly afflicted with a famine,\r\nDavid besought God to have mercy on the people, and to discover to him\r\nwhat was the cause of it, and how a remedy might be found for that\r\ndistemper. And when the prophets answered, that God would have the\r\nGibeonites avenged whom Saul the king was so wicked as to betray to\r\nslaughter, and had not observed the oath which Joshua the general and\r\nthe senate had sworn to them: If, therefore, said God, the king would\r\npermit such vengeance to be taken for those that were slain as the\r\nGibeonites should desire, he promised that he would be reconciled to\r\nthem, and free the multitude from their miseries. As soon therefore as\r\nthe king understood that this it was which God sought, he sent for the\r\nGibeonites, and asked them what it was they should have; and when they\r\ndesired to have seven sons of Saul delivered to them to be punished, he\r\ndelivered them up, but spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan. So when\r\nthe Gibeonites had received the men, they punished them as they pleased;\r\nupon which God began to send rain, and to recover the earth to bring\r\nforth its fruits as usual, and to free it from the foregoing drought, so\r\nthat the country of the Hebrews flourished again. A little afterward the\r\nking made war against the Philistines; and when he had joined battle\r\nwith them, and put them to flight, he was left alone, as he was in\r\npursuit of them; and when he was quite tired down, he was seen by one of\r\nthe enemy, his name was Achmon, the son of Araph, he was one of the sons\r\nof the giants. He had a spear, the handle of which weighed three hundred\r\nshekels, and a breastplate of chain-work, and a sword. He turned back,\r\nand ran violently to slay [David] their enemy's king, for he was quite\r\ntired out with labor; but Abishai, Joab's brother, appeared on the\r\nsudden, and protected the king with his shield, as he lay down, and slew\r\nthe enemy. Now the multitude were very uneasy at these dangers of the\r\nking, and that he was very near to be slain; and the rulers made him\r\nswear that he would no more go out with them to battle, lest he should\r\ncome to some great misfortune by his courage and boldness, and thereby\r\ndeprive the people of the benefits they now enjoyed by his means, and of\r\nthose that they might hereafter enjoy by his living a long time among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n2. When the king heard that the Philistines were gathered together at\r\nthe city Gazara, he sent an army against them, when Sibbechai the\r\nHittite, one of David's most courageous men, behaved himself so as to\r\ndeserve great commendation, for he slew many of those that bragged they\r\nwere the posterity of the giants, and vaunted themselves highly on that\r\naccount, and thereby was the occasion of victory to the Hebrews. After\r\nwhich defeat, the Philistines made war again; and when David had sent an\r\narmy against them, Nephan his kinsman fought in a single combat with the\r\nstoutest of all the Philistines, and slew him, and put the rest to\r\nflight. Many of them also were slain in the fight. Now a little while\r\nafter this, the Philistines pitched their camp at a city which lay not\r\nfar off the bounds of the country of the Hebrews. They had a man who was\r\nsix cubits tall, and had on each of his feet and hands one more toe and\r\nfinger than men naturally have. Now the person who was sent against them\r\nby David out of his army was Jonathan, the son of Shimea, who fought\r\nthis man in a single combat, and slew him; and as he was the person who\r\ngave the turn to the battle, he gained the greatest reputation for\r\ncourage therein. This man also vaunted himself to be of the sons of the\r\ngiants. But after this fight the Philistines made war no more against\r\nthe Israelites.\r\n\r\n3. And now David being freed from wars and dangers, and enjoying for the\r\nfuture a profound peace, 22 composed songs and hymns to God of several\r\nsorts of metre; some of those which he made were trimeters, and some\r\nwere pentameters. He also made instruments of music, and taught the\r\nLevites to sing hymns to God, both on that called the sabbath day, and\r\non other festivals. Now the construction of the instruments was thus:\r\nThe viol was an instrument of ten strings, it was played upon with a\r\nbow; the psaltery had twelve musical notes, and was played upon by the\r\nfingers; the cymbals were broad and large instruments, and were made of\r\nbrass. And so much shall suffice to be spoken by us about these\r\ninstruments, that the readers may not be wholly unacquainted with their\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n4. Now all the men that were about David were men of courage. Those that\r\nwere most illustrious and famous of them for their actions were thirty-\r\neight; of five of whom I will only relate the performances, for these\r\nwill suffice to make manifest the virtues of the others also; for these\r\nwere powerful enough to subdue countries, and conquer great nations.\r\nFirst, therefore, was Jessai, the son of Achimaas, who frequently leaped\r\nupon the troops of the enemy, and did not leave off fighting till he\r\noverthrew nine hundred of them. After him was Eleazar, the son of Dodo,\r\nwho was with the king at Arasam. This man, when once the Israelites were\r\nunder a consternation at the multitude of the Philistines, and were\r\nrunning away, stood alone, and fell upon the enemy, and slew many of\r\nthem, till his sword clung to his hand by the blood he had shed, and\r\ntill the Israelites, seeing the Philistines retire by his means, came\r\ndown from the mountains and pursued them, and at that time won a\r\nsurprising and a famous victory, while Eleazar slew the men, and the\r\nmultitude followed and spoiled their dead bodies. The third was Sheba,\r\nthe son of Ilus. Now this man, when, in the wars against the\r\nPhilistines, they pitched their camp at a place called Lehi, and when\r\nthe Hebrews were again afraid of their army, and did not stay, he stood\r\nstill alone, as an army and a body of men; and some of them he\r\noverthrew, and some who were not able to abide his strength and force he\r\npursued. These are the works of the hands, and of fighting, which these\r\nthree performed. Now at the time when the king was once at Jerusalem,\r\nand the army of the Philistines came upon him to fight him, David went\r\nup to the top of the citadel, as we have already said, to inquire of God\r\nconcerning the battle, while the enemy's camp lay in the valley that\r\nextends to the city Bethlehem, which is twenty furlongs distant from\r\nJerusalem. Now David said to his companions, \"We have excellent water in\r\nmy own city, especially that which is in the pit near the gate,\"\r\nwondering if any one would bring him some of it to drink; but he said\r\nthat he would rather have it than a great deal of money. When these\r\nthree men heard what he said, they ran away immediately, and burst\r\nthrough the midst of their enemy's camp, and came to Bethlehem; and when\r\nthey had drawn the water, they returned again through the enemy's camp\r\nto the king, insomuch that the Philistines were so surprised at their\r\nboldness and alacrity, that they were quiet, and did nothing against\r\nthem, as if they despised their small number. But when the water was\r\nbrought to the king, he would not drink it, saying, that it was brought\r\nby the danger and the blood of men, and that it was not proper on that\r\naccount to drink it. But he poured it out to God, and gave him thanks\r\nfor the salvation of the men. Next to these was Abishai, Joab's brother;\r\nfor he in one day slew six hundred. The fifth of these was Benaiah, by\r\nlineage a priest; for being challenged by [two] eminent men in the\r\ncountry of Moab, he overcame them by his valor, Moreover, there was a\r\nman, by nation an Egyptian, who was of a vast bulk, and challenged him,\r\nyet did he, when he was unarmed, kill him with his own spear, which he\r\nthrew at him; for he caught him by force, and took away his weapons\r\nwhile he was alive and fighting, and slew him with his own weapons. One\r\nmay also add this to the forementioned actions of the same man, either\r\nas the principal of them in alacrity, or as resembling the rest. When\r\nGod sent a snow, there was a lion who slipped and fell into a certain\r\npit, and because the pit's mouth was narrow it was evident he would\r\nperish, being enclosed with the snow; so when he saw no way to get out\r\nand save himself, he roared. When Benaiah heard the wild beast, he went\r\ntowards him, and coming at the noise he made, he went down into the\r\nmouth of the pit and smote him, as he struggled, with a stake that lay\r\nthere, and immediately slew him. The other thirty-three were like these\r\nin valor also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. That When David Had Numbered the People, They Were Punished;\r\nand How the Divine Compassion Restrained That Punishment.\r\n\r\n1. Now king David was desirous to know how many ten thousands there were\r\nof the people, but forgot the commands of Moses, 23 who told them\r\nbeforehand, that if the multitude were numbered, they should pay half a\r\nshekel to God for every head. Accordingly the king commanded Joab, the\r\ncaptain of his host, to go and number the whole multitude; but when he\r\nsaid there was no necessity for such a numeration, he was not persuaded\r\n[to countermand it], but he enjoined him to make no delay, but to go\r\nabout the numbering of the Hebrews immediately. So Joab took with him\r\nthe heads of the tribes, and the scribes, and went over the country of\r\nthe Israelites, and took notice how numerous the multitude were, and\r\nreturned to Jerusalem to the king, after nine months and twenty days;\r\nand he gave in to the king the number of the people, without the tribe\r\nof Benjamin, for he had not yet numbered that tribe, no more than the\r\ntribe of Levi, for the king repented of his having sinned against God.\r\nNow the number of the rest of the Israelites was nine hundred thousand\r\nmen, who were able to bear arms and go to war; but the tribe of Judah,\r\nby itself, was four hundred thousand men.\r\n\r\n2. Now when the prophets had signified to David that God was angry at\r\nhim, he began to entreat him, and to desire he would be merciful to him,\r\nand forgive his sin. But God sent Nathan the prophet to him, to propose\r\nto him the election of three things, that he might choose which he liked\r\nbest: Whether he would have famine come upon the country for seven\r\nyears, or would have a war, and be subdued three months by his enemies?\r\nor, whether God should send a pestilence and a distemper upon the\r\nHebrews for three days? But as he was fallen to a fatal choice of great\r\nmiseries, he was in trouble, and sorely confounded; and when the prophet\r\nhad said that he must of necessity make his choice, and had ordered him\r\nto answer quickly, that he might declare what he had chosen to God, the\r\nking reasoned with himself, that in case he should ask for famine, he\r\nwould appear to do it for others, and without danger to himself, since\r\nhe had a great deal of corn hoarded up, but to the harm of others; that\r\nin case he should choose to be overcome [by his enemies] for three\r\nmonths, he would appear to have chosen war, because he had valiant men\r\nabout him, and strong holds, and that therefore he feared nothing\r\ntherefrom: so he chose that affliction which is common to kings and to\r\ntheir subjects, and in which the fear was equal on all sides; and said\r\nthis beforehand, that it was much better to fall into the hands of God,\r\nthan into those of his enemies.\r\n\r\n3. When the prophet had heard this, he declared it to God; who thereupon\r\nsent a pestilence and a mortality upon the Hebrews; nor did they die\r\nafter one and the same manner, nor so that it was easy to know what the\r\ndistemper was. Now the miserable disease was one indeed, but it carried\r\nthem off by ten thousand causes and occasions, which those that were\r\nafflicted could not understand; for one died upon the neck of another,\r\nand the terrible malady seized them before they were aware, and brought\r\nthem to their end suddenly, some giving up the ghost immediately with\r\nvery great pains and bitter grief, and some were worn away by their\r\ndistempers, and had nothing remaining to be buried, but as soon as ever\r\nthey fell were entirely macerated; some were choked, and greatly\r\nlamented their case, as being also stricken with a sudden darkness; some\r\nthere were who, as they were burying a relation, fell down dead, without\r\nfinishing the rites of the funeral. Now there perished of this disease,\r\nwhich began with the morning, and lasted till the hour of dinner,\r\nseventy thousand. Nay, the angel stretched out his hand over Jerusalem,\r\nas sending this terrible judgment upon it. But David had put on\r\nsackcloth, and lay upon the ground, entreating God, and begging that the\r\ndistemper might now cease, and that he would be satisfied with those\r\nthat had already perished. And when the king looked up into the air, and\r\nsaw the angel carried along thereby into Jerusalem, with his sword\r\ndrawn, he said to God, that he might justly be punished, who was their\r\nshepherd, but that the sheep ought to be preserved, as not having sinned\r\nat all; and he implored God that he would send his wrath upon him, and\r\nupon all his family, but spare the people.\r\n\r\n4. When God heard his supplication, he caused the pestilence to cease,\r\nand sent Gad the prophet to him, and commanded him to go up immediately\r\nto the thrashing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite, and build an altar there\r\nto God, and offer sacrifices. When David heard that, he did not neglect\r\nhis duty, but made haste to the place appointed him. Now Araunah was\r\nthrashing wheat; and when he saw the king and all his servants coming to\r\nhim, he ran before, and came to him and worshipped him: he was by his\r\nlineage a Jebusite, but a particular friend of David's; and for that\r\ncause it was that, when he overthrew the city, he did him no harm, as we\r\ninformed the reader a little before. Now Araunah inquired, \"Wherefore is\r\nmy lord come to his servant?\" He answered, to buy of him the thrashing-\r\nfloor, that he might therein build an altar to God, and offer a\r\nsacrifice. He replied, that he freely gave him both the thrashing-floor\r\nand the ploughs and the oxen for a burnt-offering; and he besought God\r\ngraciously to accept his sacrifice. But the king made answer, that he\r\ntook his generosity and magnanimity loudly, and accepted his good-will,\r\nbut he desired him to take the price of them all, for that it was not\r\njust to offer a sacrifice that cost nothing. And when Araunah said he\r\nwould do as he pleased, he bought the thrashing-floor of him for fifty\r\nshekels. And when he had built an altar, he performed Divine service,\r\nand brought a burnt-offering, and offered peace-offerings also. With\r\nthese God was pacified, and became gracious to them again. Now it\r\nhappened that Abraham 24came and offered his son Isaac for a burnt-\r\noffering at that very place; and when the youth was ready to have his\r\nthroat cut, a ram appeared on a sudden, standing by the altar, which\r\nAbraham sacrificed in the stead of his son, as we have before related.\r\nNow when king David saw that God had heard his prayer, and had\r\ngraciously accepted of his sacrifice, he resolved to call that entire\r\nplace The Altar of all the People, and to build a temple to God there;\r\nwhich words he uttered very appositely to what was to be done afterward;\r\nfor God sent the prophet to him, and told him that there should his son\r\nbuild him an altar, that son who was to take the kingdom after him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. That David Made Great Preparations For The House Of God; And\r\nThat, Upon Adonijah's Attempt To Gain The Kingdom, He Appointed Solomon\r\nTo Reign.\r\n\r\n1. After the delivery of this prophecy, the king commanded the strangers\r\nto be numbered; and they were found to be one hundred and eighty\r\nthousand; of these he appointed fourscore thousand to be hewers of\r\nstone, and the rest of the multitude to carry the stones, and of them he\r\nset over the workmen three thousand and five hundred. He also prepared a\r\ngreat quantity of iron and brass for the work, with many [and those\r\nexceeding large] cedar trees; the Tyrians and Sidonians sending them to\r\nhim, for he had sent to them for a supply of those trees. And he told\r\nhis friends that these things were now prepared, that he might leave\r\nmaterials ready for the building of the temple to his son, who was to\r\nreign after him, and that he might not have them to seek then, when he\r\nwas very young, and by reason of his age unskillful in such matters, but\r\nmight have them lying by him, and so might the more readily complete the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n2. So David called his son Solomon, and charged him, when he had\r\nreceived the kingdom, to build a temple to God, and said, \"I was willing\r\nto build God a temple myself, but he prohibited me, because I was\r\npolluted with blood and wars; but he hath foretold that Solomon, my\r\nyoungest son, should build him a temple, and should be called by that\r\nname; over whom he hath promised to take the like care as a father takes\r\nover his son; and that he would make the country of the Hebrews happy\r\nunder him, and that, not only in other respects, but by giving it peace\r\nand freedom from wars, and from internal seditions, which are the\r\ngreatest of all blessings. Since, therefore,\" says he, \"thou wast\r\nordained king by God himself before thou wast born, endeavor to render\r\nthyself worthy of this his providence, as in other instances, so\r\nparticularly in being religious, and righteous, and courageous. Keep\r\nthou also his commands and his laws, which he hath given us by Moses,\r\nand do not permit others to break them. Be zealous also to dedicate to\r\nGod a temple, which he hath chosen to be built under thy reign; nor be\r\nthou affrighted by the vastness of the work, nor set about it\r\ntimorously, for I will make all things ready before I die: and take\r\nnotice, that there are already ten thousand talents of gold, and a\r\nhundred thousand talents of silver 25 collected together. I have also\r\nlaid together brass and iron without number, and an immense quantity of\r\ntimber and of stones. Moreover, thou hast many ten thousand stone-\r\ncutters and carpenters; and if thou shalt want any thing further, do\r\nthou add somewhat of thine own. Wherefore, if thou performest this work,\r\nthou wilt be acceptable to God, and have him for thy patron.\" David also\r\nfurther exhorted the rulers of the people to assist his son in this\r\nbuilding, and to attend to the Divine service, when they should be free\r\nfrom all their misfortunes, for that they by this means should enjoy,\r\ninstead of them, peace and a happy settlement, with which blessings God\r\nrewards such men as are religious and righteous. He also gave orders,\r\nthat when the temple should be once built, they should put the ark\r\ntherein, with the holy vessels; and he assured them that they ought to\r\nhave had a temple long ago, if their fathers had not been negligent of\r\nGod's commands, who had given it in charge, that when they had got the\r\npossession of this land, they should build him a temple. Thus did David\r\ndiscourse to the governors, and to his son.\r\n\r\n3. David was now in years, and his body, by length of time, was become\r\ncold, and benumbed, insomuch that he could get no heat by covering\r\nhimself with many clothes; and when the physicians came together, they\r\nagreed to this advice, that a beautiful virgin, chosen out of the whole\r\ncountry, should sleep by the king's side, and that this damsel would\r\ncommunicate heat to him, and be a remedy against his numbness. Now there\r\nwas found in the city one woman, of a superior beauty to all other\r\nwomen, [her name was Abishag,] who, sleeping with the king, did no more\r\nthan communicate warmth to him, for he was so old that he could not know\r\nher as a husband knows his wife. But of this woman we shall speak more\r\npresently.\r\n\r\n4. Now the fourth son of David was a beautiful young man, and tall, born\r\nto him of Haggith his wife. He was named Adonijah, and was in his\r\ndisposition like to Absalom; and exalted himself as hoping to be king,\r\nand told his friends that he ought to take the government upon him. He\r\nalso prepared many chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.\r\nWhen his father saw this, he did not reprove him, nor restrain him from\r\nhis purpose, nor did he go so far as to ask wherefore he did so. Now\r\nAdonijah had for his assistants Joab the captain of the army, and\r\nAbiathar the high priest; and the only persons that opposed him were\r\nZadok the high priest, and the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah, who was\r\ncaptain of the guards, and Shimei, David's friend, with all the other\r\nmost mighty men. Now Adonijah had prepared a supper out of the city,\r\nnear the fountain that was in the king's paradise, and had invited all\r\nhis brethren except Solomon, and had taken with him Joab the captain of\r\nthe army, and: Abiathar, and the rulers of the tribe of Judah, but had\r\nnot invited to this feast either Zadok the high priest, or Nathan the\r\nprophet, or Benaiah the captain of the guards, nor any of those of the\r\ncontrary party. This matter was told by Nathan the prophet to Bathsheba,\r\nSolomon's mother, that Adonijah was king, and that David knew nothing of\r\nit; and he advised her to save herself and her son Solomon, and to go by\r\nherself to David, and say to him, that he had indeed sworn that Solomon\r\nshould reign after him, but that in the mean time Adonijah had already\r\ntaken the kingdom. He said that he, the prophet himself, would come\r\nafter her, and when she had spoken thus to the king, would confirm what\r\nshe had said. Accordingly Bathsheba agreed with Nathan, and went in to\r\nthe king and worshipped him, and when she had desired leave to speak\r\nwith him, she told him all things in the manner that Nathan had\r\nsuggested to her; and related what a supper Adonijah had made, and who\r\nthey were whom he had invited; Abiathar the and Joab the general, and\r\nDavid's sons, excepting Solomon and his intimate friends. She also said\r\nthat all the people had their eyes upon him, to know whom he would\r\nchoose for their king. She desired him also to consider how, after his\r\ndeparture, Adonijah, if he were king, would slay her and her son\r\nSolomon.\r\n\r\n5. Now, as Bathsheba was speaking, the keeper of the king's chambers\r\ntold him that Nathan desired to see him. And when the king had commanded\r\nthat he should be admitted, he came in, and asked him whether he had\r\nordained Adonijah to be king, and delivered the government to him, or\r\nnot; for that he had made a splendid supper, and invited all his sons,\r\nexcept Solomon; as also that he had invited Joab, the captain of his\r\nhost, [and Abiathar the high priest,] who are feasting with applauses,\r\nand many joyful sounds of instruments, and wish that his kingdom may\r\nlast for ever; but he hath not invited me, nor Zadok the high priest,\r\nnor Benaiah the captain of the guards; and it is but fit that all should\r\nknow whether this be done by thy approbation or not. When Nathan had\r\nsaid thus, the king commanded that they should call Bathsheba to him,\r\nfor she had gone out of the room when the prophet came. And when\r\nBathsheba was come, David said, \"I swear by Almighty God, that thy son\r\nSolomon shall certainly he king, as I formerly swore; and that he shall\r\nsit upon my throne, and that this very day also.\" So Bathsheba\r\nworshipped him, and wished him a long life; and the king sent for Zadok\r\nthe high priest, and Benaiah the captain of the guards; and when they\r\nwere come, he ordered them to take with them Nathan the prophet, and all\r\nthe armed men about the palace, and to set his son Solomon upon the\r\nking's mule, and to carry him out of the city to the fountain called\r\nGihon, and to anoint him there with the holy oil, and to make him king.\r\nThis he charged Zadok the high priest, and Nathan the prophet, to do,\r\nand commanded them to follow Solomon through the midst of the city, and\r\nto sound the trumpets, and wish aloud that Solomon the king may sit upon\r\nthe royal throne for ever, that so all the people may know that he is\r\nordained king by his father. He also gave Solomon a charge concerning\r\nhis government, to rule the whole nation of the Hebrews, and\r\nparticularly the tribe of Judah, religiously and righteously. And when\r\nBenaiah had prayed to God to be favorable to Solomon, without any delay\r\nthey set Solomon upon the mule, and brought him out of the city to the\r\nfountain, and anointed him with oil, and brought him into the city\r\nagain, with acclamations and wishes that his kingdom might continue a\r\nlong time: and when they had introduced him into the king's house, they\r\nset him upon the throne; whereupon all the people betook themselves to\r\nmake merry, and to celebrate a festival, dancing and delighting\r\nthemselves with musical pipes, till both the earth and the air echoed\r\nwith the multitude of the instruments of music.\r\n\r\n6. Now when Adonijah and his guests perceived this noise, they were in\r\ndisorder; and Joab the captain of the host said he was not pleased with\r\nthese echoes, and the sound of these trumpets. And when supper was set\r\nbefore them, nobody tasted of it, but they were all very thoughtful what\r\nwould be the matter. Then Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the high priest,\r\ncame running to them; and when Adonijah saw the young man gladly, and\r\nsaid to him that he was a good messenger, he declared to them the whole\r\nmatter about Solomon, and the determination of king David: hereupon both\r\nAdonijah and all the guests rose hastily from the feast, and every one\r\nfled to their own homes. Adonijah also, as afraid of the king for what\r\nhe had done, became a supplicant to God, and took hold of the horns of\r\nthe altar, which were prominent. It was also told Solomon that he had so\r\ndone; and that he desired to receive assurances from him that he would\r\nnot remember the injury he had done, and not inflict any severe\r\npunishment for it. Solomon answered very mildly and prudently, that he\r\nforgave him this his offense; but said withal, that if he were found out\r\nin any attempt for new innovations, that he would be the author of his\r\nown punishment. So he sent to him, and raised him up from the place of\r\nhis supplication. And when he was come to the king, and had worshipped\r\nhim, the king bid him go away to his own house, and have no suspicion of\r\nany harm; and desired him to show himself a worthy man, as what would\r\ntend to his own advantage.\r\n\r\n7. But David, being desirous of ordaining his son king of all the\r\npeople, called together their rulers to Jerusalem, with the priests and\r\nthe Levites; and having first numbered the Levites, he found them to be\r\nthirty-eight thousand, from thirty years old to fifty; out of which he\r\nappointed twenty-three thousand to take care of the building of the\r\ntemple, and out of the same, six thousand to be judges of the people and\r\nscribes, four thousand for porters to the house of God, and as many for\r\nsingers, to sing to the instruments which David had prepared, as we have\r\nsaid already. He divided them also into courses: and when he had\r\nseparated the priests from them, he found of these priests twenty-four\r\ncourses, sixteen of the house of Eleazar, and eight of that of Ithamar;\r\nand he ordained that one course should minister to God eight days, from\r\nsabbath to sabbath. And thus were the courses distributed by lot, in the\r\npresence of David, and Zadok and Abiathar the high priests, and of all\r\nthe rulers; and that course which came up first was written down as the\r\nfirst, and accordingly the second, and so on to the twenty-fourth; and\r\nthis partition hath remained to this day. He also made twenty-four parts\r\nof the tribe of Levi; and when they cast lots, they came up in the same\r\nmanner for their courses of eight days. He also honored the posterity of\r\nMoses, and made them the keepers of the treasures of God, and of the\r\ndonations which the kings dedicated. He also ordained that all the tribe\r\nof Levi, as well as the priests, should serve God night and day, as\r\nMoses had enjoined them.\r\n\r\n8. After this he parted the entire army into twelve parts, with their\r\nleaders [and captains of hundreds] and commanders. Now every part had\r\ntwenty-four thousand, which were ordered to wait on Solomon, by thirty\r\ndays at a time, from the first day till the last, with the captains of\r\nthousands and captains of hundreds. He also set rulers over every part,\r\nsuch as he knew to be good and righteous men. He set others also to take\r\ncharge of the treasures, and of the villages, and of the fields, and of\r\nthe beasts, whose names I do not think it necessary to mention. When\r\nDavid had ordered all these officers after the manner before mentioned,\r\nhe called the rulers of the Hebrews, and their heads of tribes, and the\r\nofficers over the several divisions, and those that were appointed over\r\nevery work, and every possession; and standing upon a high pulpit, he\r\nsaid to the multitude as follows: \"My brethren and my people, I would\r\nhave you know that I intended to build a house for God, and prepared a\r\nlarge quantity of gold, and a hundred thousand talents of silver; but\r\nGod prohibited me by the prophet Nathan, because of the wars I had on\r\nyour account, and because my right hand was polluted with the slaughter\r\nof our enemies; but he commanded that my son, who was to succeed me in\r\nthe kingdom, should build a temple for him. Now therefore, since you\r\nknow that of the twelve sons whom Jacob our forefather had Judah was\r\nappointed to be king, and that I was preferred before my six brethren,\r\nand received the government from God, and that none of them were uneasy\r\nat it, so do I also desire that my sons be not seditious one against\r\nanother, now Solomon has received the kingdom, but to bear him\r\ncheerfully for their lord, as knowing that God hath chosen him; for it\r\nis not a grievous thing to obey even a foreigner as a ruler, if it be\r\nGod's will, but it is fit to rejoice when a brother hath obtained that\r\ndignity, since the rest partake of it with him. And I pray that the\r\npromises of God may be fulfilled; and that this happiness which he hath\r\npromised to bestow upon king Solomon, over all the country, may continue\r\ntherein for all time to come. And these promises O son, will be firm,\r\nand come to a happy end, if thou showest thyself to be a religious and a\r\nrighteous man, and an observer of the laws of thy country; but if not,\r\nexpect adversity upon thy disobedience to them.\"\r\n\r\n9. Now when the king had said this, he left off; but gave the\r\ndescription and pattern of the building of the temple in the sight of\r\nthem all to Solomon: of the foundations and of the chambers, inferior\r\nand superior; how many they were to be, and how large in height and in\r\nbreadth; as also he determined the weight of the golden and silver\r\nvessels: moreover, he earnestly excited them with his words to use the\r\nutmost alacrity about the work; he exhorted the rulers also, and\r\nparticularly the tribe of Levi, to assist him, both because of his\r\nyouth, and because God had chosen him to take care of the building of\r\nthe temple, and of the government of the kingdom. He also declared to\r\nthem that the work would be easy, and not very laborious to them,\r\nbecause he had prepared for it many talents of gold, and more of silver,\r\nwith timber, and a great many carpenters and stone-cutters, and a large\r\nquantity of emeralds, and all sorts of precious stones; and he said,\r\nthat even now he would give of the proper goods of his own dominion two\r\nhundred talents, and three hundred other talents of pure gold, for the\r\nmost holy place, and for the chariot of God, the cherubim, which are to\r\nstand over and cover the ark. Now when David had done speaking, there\r\nappeared great alacrity among the rulers, and the priests, and the\r\nLevites, who now contributed and made great and splendid promises for a\r\nfuture Contribution; for they undertook to bring of gold five thousand\r\ntalents, and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and\r\nmany ten thousand talents of iron; and if any one had a precious stone\r\nhe brought it, and bequeathed it to be put among the treasures; of which\r\nJachiel, one of the posterity of Moses, had the care.\r\n\r\n10. Upon this occasion all the people rejoiced, as in particular did\r\nDavid, when he saw the zeal and forward ambition of the rulers, and the\r\npriests, and of all the rest; and he began to bless God with a loud\r\nvoice, calling him the Father and Parent of the universe, and the Author\r\nof human and divine things, with which he had adorned Solomon, the\r\npatron and guardian of the Hebrew nation, and of its happiness, and of\r\nthat kingdom which he hath given his son. Besides this, he prayed for\r\nhappiness to all the people; and to Solomon his son, a sound and a\r\nrighteous mind, and confirmed in all sorts of virtue; and then he\r\ncommanded the multitude to bless God; upon which they all fell down upon\r\nthe ground and worshipped him. They also gave thanks to David, on\r\naccount of all the blessings which they had received ever since he had\r\ntaken the kingdom. On the next day he presented sacrifices to God, a\r\nthousand bullocks, and as many lambs, which they offered for burnt-\r\nofferings. They also offered peace-offerings, and slew many ten thousand\r\nsacrifices; and the king feasted all day, together with all the people;\r\nand they anointed Solomon a second time with the oil, and appointed him\r\nto be king, and Zadok to be the high priest of the whole multitude. And\r\nwhen they had brought Solomon to the royal palace, and had set him upon\r\nhis father's throne, they were obedient to him from that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15. What Charge David Gave To his Son Solomon At The Approach Of\r\nHis Death, And How Many Things He Left Him For The Building Of The\r\nTemple.\r\n\r\n1. A Little afterward David also fell into a distemper, by reason of his\r\nage; and perceiving that he was near to death, he called his son\r\nSolomon, and discoursed to him thus: \"I am now, O my son, going to my\r\ngrave, and to my fathers, which is the common way which all men that now\r\nare, or shall be hereafter, must go; from which way it is no longer\r\npossible to return, and to know any thing that is done in this world. On\r\nwhich account I exhort thee, while I am still alive, though already very\r\nnear to death, in the same manner as I have formerly said in my advice\r\nto thee, to be righteous towards thy subjects, and religious towards\r\nGod, that hath given thee thy kingdom; to observe his commands and his\r\nlaws, which he hath sent us by Moses; and neither do thou out of favor\r\nnor flattery allow any lust or other passion to weigh with thee to\r\ndisregard them; for if thou transgressest his laws, thou wilt lose the\r\nfavor of God, and thou wilt turn away his providence from thee in all\r\nthings; but if thou behave thyself so as it behooves thee, and as I\r\nexhort thee, thou wilt preserve our kingdom to our family, and no other\r\nhouse will bear rule over the Hebrews but we ourselves for all ages. Be\r\nthou also mindful of the transgressions of Joab, 26 the captain of the\r\nhost, who hath slain two generals out of envy, and those righteous and\r\ngood men, Abner the son of Ner, and Amasa the son of Jether; whose death\r\ndo thou avenge as shall seem good to thee, since Joab hath been too hard\r\nfor me, and more potent than myself, and so hath escaped punishment\r\nhitherto. I also commit to thee the son of Barzillai the Gileadite,\r\nwhom, in order to gratify me, thou shalt have in great honor, and take\r\ngreat care of; for we have not done good to him first, but we only repay\r\nthat debt which we owe to his father for what he did to me in my flight.\r\nThere is also Shimei the son of Gera, of the tribe of Benjamin, who,\r\nafter he had cast many reproaches upon me, when, in my flight, I was\r\ngoing to Mahanaim, met me at Jordan, and received assurances that he\r\nshould then suffer nothing. Do thou now seek out for some just occasion,\r\nand punish him.\"\r\n\r\n2. When David had given these admonitions to his son about public\r\naffairs, and about his friends, and about those whom he knew to deserve\r\npunishment, he died, having lived seventy years, and reigned seven years\r\nand six months in Hebron over the tribe of Judah, and thirty-three years\r\nin Jerusalem over all the country. This man was of an excellent\r\ncharacter, and was endowed with all virtues that were desirable in a\r\nking, and in one that had the preservation of so many tribes committed\r\nto him; for he was a man of valor in a very extraordinary degree, and\r\nwent readily and first of all into dangers, when he was to fight for his\r\nsubjects, as exciting the soldiers to action by his own labors, and\r\nfighting for them, and not by commanding them in a despotic way. He was\r\nalso of very great abilities in understanding, and apprehension of\r\npresent and future circumstances, when he was to manage any affairs. He\r\nwas prudent and moderate, and kind to such as were under any calamities;\r\nhe was righteous and humane, which are good qualities, peculiarly fit\r\nfor kings; nor was he guilty of any offense in the exercise of so great\r\nan authority, but in the business of the wife of Uriah. He also left\r\nbehind him greater wealth than any other king, either of the Hebrews or,\r\nof other nations, ever did.\r\n\r\n3. He was buried by his son Solomon, in Jerusalem, with great\r\nmagnificence, and with all the other funeral pomp which kings used to be\r\nburied with; moreover, he had great and immense wealth buried with him,\r\nthe vastness of which may be easily conjectured at by what I shall now\r\nsay; for a thousand and three hundred years afterward Hyrcanus the high\r\npriest, when he was besieged by Antiochus, that was called the Pious,\r\nthe son of Demetrius, and was desirous of giving him money to get him to\r\nraise the siege and draw off his army, and having no other method of\r\ncompassing the money, opened one room of David's sepulcher, and took out\r\nthree thousand talents, and gave part of that sum to Antiochus; and by\r\nthis means caused the siege to be raised, as we have informed the reader\r\nelsewhere. Nay, after him, and that many years, Herod the king opened\r\nanother room, and took away a great deal of money, and yet neither of\r\nthem came at the coffins of the kings themselves, for their bodies were\r\nburied under the earth so artfully, that they did not appear to even\r\nthose that entered into their monuments. But so much shall suffice us to\r\nhave said concerning these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ It ought to be here noted, that Joab, Abishai, and Asahel\r\nwere all three David's nephews, the sons of his sister Zeraiah, as 1\r\nChronicles 2:16; and that Amasa was also his nephew by his other sister\r\nAbigail, ver. 17.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ This may be a true observation of Josephus's, that Samuel\r\nby command from God entailed the crown on David and his posterity; for\r\nno further did that entail ever reach, Solomon himself having never had\r\nany promise made him that his posterity should always have the right to\r\nit.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ These words of Josephus concerning the tribe of Issachar,\r\nwho foreknew what was to come hereafter,\" are best paraphrased by the\r\nparallel text. 1 Chronicles 12:32, \"Who had understanding of the times\r\nto know what Israel ought to do;\" that is, who had so much knowledge in\r\nastronomy as to make calendars for the Israelites, that they might keep\r\ntheir festivals, and plough and sow, and gather in their harvests and\r\nvintage, in due season.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ What our other copies say of Mount Sion, as alone properly\r\ncalled the city of David, 2 Samuel 5:6-9, and of this its siege and\r\nconquest now by David, Josephus applies to the whole city Jerusalem,\r\nthough including the citadel also; by what authority we do not now know\r\nperhaps, after David had united them together, or joined the citadel to\r\nthe lower city, as sect. 2, Josephus esteemed them as one city. However,\r\nthis notion seems to be confirmed by what the same Josephus says\r\nconcerning David's and many other kings of Judah's sepulchers, which as\r\nthe authors of the books of Kings and Chronicles say were in the city of\r\nDavid, so does Josephus still say they were in Jerusalem. The sepulcher\r\nof David seems to have been also a known place in the several days of\r\nHyrcanus, of Herod, and of St. Peter, Antiq. B. XIII. ch. 8. sect. 4 B.\r\nXVI. ch. 8. sect. 1; Acts 2:29. Now no such royal sepulchers have been\r\nfound about Mount Sion, but are found close by the north wall of\r\nJerusalem, which I suspect, therefore, to be these very sepulchers. See\r\nthe note on ch. 15. sect. 3. In the meantime, Josephus's explication of\r\nthe lame, and the blind, and the maimed, as set to keep this city or\r\ncitadel, seems to be the truth, and gives the best light to that history\r\nin our Bible. Mr. Ottius truly observes, [up. Hayercamp, p. 305,] that\r\nJosephus never mentions Mount Sion by that name, as taking it for an\r\nappellative, as I suppose, and not for a proper name; he still either\r\nstyles it The Citadel, or The Upper City; nor do I see any reason for\r\nMr. Ottius's evil suspicions about this procedure of Josephus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 (return) [ Some copies of Josephus have here Solyma, or Salem; and\r\nothers Hierosolyma, or Jerusalem. The latter best agree to what Josephus\r\nsays elsewhere, [Of the War, B. VI. ch. 10.,] that this city was called\r\nSolyma, or Salem, before the days of Melchisedec, but was by him called\r\nHierosolyma, or Jerusalem. I rather suppose it to have been so called\r\nafter Abraham had received that oracle Jehovah Jireh, \"The Lord will\r\nsee, or provide,\" Genesis 22;14. The latter word, Jireh, with a little\r\nalteration, prefixed to the old name Salem, Peace, will be Jerusalem;\r\nand since that expression, \"God will see,\" or rather, \"God will provide\r\nhimself a lamb for a burnt-offering,\" ver. 8, 14, is there said to have\r\nbeen proverbial till the days of Moses, this seems to me the most\r\nprobable derivation of that name, which will then denote that God would\r\nprovide peace by that \"Lamb of God which was to take away the sins of\r\nthe world.\" However, that which is put into brackets can hardly be\r\nsupposed the genuine words of Josephus, as Dr. Hudson well judges.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 (return) [ It deserves here to be remarked, that Saul very rarely, and\r\nDavid very frequently, consulted God by Urim; and that David aimed\r\nalways to depend, not on his own prudence or abilities but on the Divine\r\ndirection, contrary to Saul's practice. See sect. 2, and the note on\r\nAntiq. B. III. ch. 8. sect. 9; and when Saul's daughter, [but David's\r\nwife,] Michal, laughed at David's dancing before the ark, 2 Samuel 6:16,\r\n&c., and here, sect. l, 2, 3, it is probable she did so, because her\r\nfather Saul did not use to pay such a regard to the ark, to the Urim\r\nthere inquired by, or to God's worship before it, and because she\r\nthought it beneath the dignity of a king to be so religious.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 (return) [ Josephus seems to be partly in the right, when he observes\r\nhere that Uzzah was no priest, [though perhaps he might be a Levite,]\r\nand was therefore struck dead for touching the ark, contrary to the law,\r\nand for which profane rashness death was the penalty by that law,\r\nNumbers 4:15, 20. See the like before, Antiq. B. VI. ch. 1. sect. 4. It\r\nis not improbable that the putting this ark in a cart, when it ought to\r\nhave been carried by the priests or Levites, as it was presently here in\r\nJosephus so carried from Obededom's house to David's, might be also an\r\noccasion of the anger of God on that breach of his law. See Numbers\r\n4:15; 1 Chronicles 15:13.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8 (return) [ Josephus here informs us, that, according to his\r\nunderstanding of the sense of his copy of the Pentateuch, Moses had\r\nhimself foretold the building of the temple, which yet is no where, that\r\nI know of, in our present copies. And that this is not a mistake set\r\ndown by him unwarily, appears by what he observed before, on Antiq. B.\r\nIV. ch. 8. sect. 46, how Moses foretold that, upon the Jews' future\r\ndisobedience, their temple should be burnt and rebuilt, and that not\r\nonce only, but several times afterward. See also Josephus's mention of\r\nGod's former commands to build such a temple presently, ch. 14. sect. 2,\r\ncontrary to our other copies, or at least to our translation of the\r\nHebrew, 2 Samuel 7:6, 7; 1 Chronicles 17:5, 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n9 (return) [ Josephus seems, in this place, with our modern interpreters\r\nto confound the two distinct predictions which God made to David and to\r\nNathan, concerning the building him a temple by one of David's\r\nposterity; the one belongeth to Solomon, the other to the Messiah; the\r\ndistinction between which is of the greatest consequence to the\r\nChristian religion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10 (return) [ Whether Syria Zobah, 2 Samuel 3:8; 1 Chronicles 18:3-8, be\r\nSophene, as Josephus here supposes; which yet Ptolemy places beyond\r\nEuphrates, as Dr. Hudson observes here, whereas Zobah was on this side;\r\nor whether Josephus was not here guilty of a mistake in his geography; I\r\ncannot certainly determine.]\r\n\r\n\r\n11 (return) [ David's reserving only one hundred chariots for himself\r\nout of one thousand he had taken from Hadadezer, was most probably in\r\ncompliance with the law of Moses, which forbade a king of Israel \"to\r\nmultiply horses to himself,\" Deuteronomy 17:16; one of the principal\r\nuses of horses in Judea at that time being for drawing their chariots.\r\nSee Joshua 12:6; and Antiq. B. V. ch. 1. sect. 18. It deserves here to\r\nbe remarked, that this Hadad, being a very great king, was conquered by\r\nDavid, whose posterity yet for several generations were called Benhadad,\r\nor the son of Hadad, till the days of Hazael, whose son Adar or Ader is\r\nalso in our Hebrew copy [2 Kings 13:24: written Benhadad, but in\r\nJosephus Adad or Adar. And strange it is, that the son of Hazael, said\r\nto be such in the same text, and in Josephus, Antiq. B. IX. ch. 8. sect.\r\n7, should still be called the son of Hadad. I would, therefore, here\r\ncorrect our Hebrew copy from Josephus's, which seems to have the true\r\nreading, nor does the testimony of Nicolaus of Damascus, produced in\r\nthis place by Josephus, seem to be faultless, when it says that he was\r\nthe third of the Hadads, or second of the Benhadads, who besieged\r\nSamaria in the days of Ahab. He must rather have been the seventh or\r\neighth, if there were ten in all of that name, as we are assured there\r\nwere. For this testimony makes all the Hadads or Benhadads of the same\r\nline, and to have immediately succeeded one another; whereas Hazael was\r\nnot of that line, nor is he called Hadad or Benhadad in any copy. And\r\nnote, that from this Hadad, in the days of David, to the beginning of\r\nHazael, were near two hundred years, according to the exactest\r\nchronology of Josephus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12 (return) [ By this great victory over the Idameans or Edomites, the\r\nposterity of Esau, and by the consequent tribute paid by that nation to\r\nthe Jews, were the prophecies delivered to Rebecca before Jacob and Esau\r\nwere born, and by old Isaac before his death, that the elder, Esau, [or\r\nthe Edomites,] should serve and the younger, Jacob, [or the Israelites,]\r\nand Jacob [or the Israelites] should be Esau's [or the Edomites'] lord,\r\nremarkably fulfilled.

Nor could Josephus well estimate\r\nit higher, since he here says that David wore it on his head\r\nperpetually.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14 (return) [ Whether Josephus saw the words of our copies, 2 Samuel\r\n12:31, and 1 Chronicles 20:3, that David put the inhabitants, or at\r\nleast the garrison of Rabbah, and of the other Ammonite cities, which he\r\nbesieged and took, under, or cut them with saws, and under, or with\r\nharrows of iron, and under, or with axes of iron, and made them pass\r\nthrough the brick-kiln, is not here directly expressed. If he saw them,\r\nas is most probable he did, he certainly expounded them of tormenting\r\nthese Ammonites to death, who were none of those seven nations of Canaan\r\nwhose wickedness had rendered them incapable of mercy; otherwise I\r\nshould be inclinable to think that the meaning, at least as the words\r\nare in Samuel, might only be this: That they were made the lowest\r\nslaves, to work in sawing of timber or stone, in harrowing the fields,\r\nin hewing timber, in making and burning bricks, and the like hard\r\nservices, but without taking away their lives. We never elsewhere, that\r\nI remember, meet with such methods of cruelty in putting men to death in\r\nall the Bible, or in any other ancient history whatsoever; nor do the\r\nwords in Samuel seem naturally to refer to any such thing.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15 (return) [ Of this weight of Absalom's hair, how in twenty or thirty\r\nyears it might well amount to two hundred shekels, or to somewhat above\r\nsix pounds avoirdupois, see the Literal Accomplishment of Prophecies, p.\r\n77, 78. But a late very judicious author thinks that the LXXX. meant not\r\nits weight, but its value, Was twenty shekels.—Dr. Wall's Critical Notes\r\non the Old Testament, upon 2 Samuel 14:26. It does not appear what was\r\nJosephus's opinion: he sets the text down honestly as he found it in his\r\ncopies, only he thought that \"at the end of days,\" when Absalom polled\r\nor weighed his hair, was once a week.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 (return) [ This is one of the best corrections that Josephus's copy\r\naffords us of a text that in our ordinary copies is grossly corrupted.\r\nThey say that this rebellion of Absalom was forty years after what went\r\nbefore, [Footnote of his reconciliation to his father,] whereas the\r\nseries of the history shows it could not be more than four years after\r\nit, as here in Josephus; whose number is directly confirmed by that copy\r\nof the Septuagint version whence the Armenian translation was made,\r\nwhich gives us the small number of four years.]\r\n\r\n\r\n17 (return) [ This reflection of Josephus's, that God brought to nought\r\nthe dangerous counsel of Ahithophel, and directly infatuated wicked\r\nAbsalom to reject it, [which infatuation is what the Scripture styles\r\nthe judicial hardening the hearts and blinding the eyes of men, who, by\r\ntheir former voluntary wickedness, have justly deserved to be destroyed,\r\nand are thereby brought to destruction,] is a very just one, and in him\r\nnot unfrequent. Nor does Josephus ever puzzle himself, or perplex his\r\nreaders, with subtle hypotheses as to the manner of such judicial\r\ninfatuations by God, while the justice of them is generally so obvious.\r\nThat peculiar manner of the Divine operations, or permissions, or the\r\nmeans God makes use of in such cases, is often impenetrable by us.\r\n\"Secret things belong to the Lord our God; but those things that are\r\nrevealed belong to us, and to our children for ever, that we may do all\r\nthe words of this law,\" Deuteronomy 29:29.

IX. ch. 4. sect. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n18 (return) [ Those that take a view of my description of the gates of\r\nthe temple, will not be surprised at this account of David's throne,\r\nboth here and 2 Samuel 18:21, that it was between two gates or portals.\r\nGates being in cities, as well as at the temple, large open places, with\r\na portal at the entrance, and another at the exit, between which\r\njudicial causes were heard, and public consultations taken, as is well\r\nknown from several places of Scripture, 2 Chronicles 31:2; Psalm 9:14;\r\n137:5; Proverbs 1:21; 8:3, 31; 31:23, and often elsewhere.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19 (return) [ Since David was now in Mahanairn, and in the open place of\r\nthat city gate, which seems still to have been built the highest of any\r\npart of the wall, and since our other copies say he went up to the\r\nchamber over the gate, 2 Samuel 18:33, I think we ought to correct our\r\npresent reading in Josephus, and for city, should read gate, i.e.\r\ninstead of the highest part of the city, should say the highest part of\r\nthe gate. Accordingly we find David presently, in Josephus, as well as\r\nin our other copies, 2 Samuel 19:8, sitting as before, in the gate of\r\nthe city.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20 (return) [ By David's disposal of half Mephibosheth's estate to Ziba,\r\none would imagine that he was a good deal dissatisfied, and doubtful\r\nwhether Mephibosheth's story were entirely true or not; nor does David\r\nnow invite him to diet with him, as he did before, but only forgives\r\nhim, if he had been at all guilty. Nor is this odd way of mourning that\r\nMephibosheth made use of here, and 2 Samuel 19:24, wholly free from\r\nsuspicion by hypocrisy. If Ziba neglected or refused to bring\r\nMephibosheh an ass of his own, on which he might ride to David, it is\r\nhalf to suppose that so great a man as he was should not be able to\r\nprocure some other beast for the same purpose.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21 (return) [ I clearly prefer Josephus's reading here, when it supposes\r\neleven tribes, including Benjamin, to be on the one side, and the tribe\r\nof Judah alone on the other, since Benjamin, in general, had been still\r\nfather of the house of Saul, and less firm to David hitherto, than any\r\nof the rest, and so cannot be supposed to be joined with Judah at this\r\ntime, to make it double, especially when the following rebellion was\r\nheaded by a Benjamite. See sect. 6, and 2 Samuel 20:2, 4.]\r\n\r\n\r\n22 (return) [ This section is a very remarkable one, and shows that, in\r\nthe opinion of Josephus, David composed the Book of Psalms, not at\r\nseveral times before, as their present inscriptions frequently imply,\r\nbut generally at the latter end of his life, or after his wars were\r\nover. Nor does Josephus, nor the authors of the known books of the Old\r\nand New Testament, nor the Apostolical Constitutions, seem to have\r\nascribed any of them to any other author than to David himself. See\r\nEssay on the Old Testament, pages 174, 175. Of these metres of the\r\nPsalms, see the note on Antiq. B. II. ch. 16. sect. 4.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23 (return) [ The words of God by Moses, Exodus 30:12, sufficiently\r\nsatisfy the reason here given by Josephus for the great plague mentioned\r\nin this chapter:—\"When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel\r\nafter their number, then shall they give a ransom for his soul unto the\r\nLord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague amongst them,\r\nwhen numberest them.\" Nor indeed could David's or the neglect of\r\nexecuting this law at this numeration of half a shekel apiece with them,\r\nwhen they came numbered. The great reason why nations are so committed\r\nby and with their wicked kings and governors that they almost constantly\r\ncomply with them in their of or disobedience to the Divine laws, and\r\nsuffer Divine laws to go into disuse or contempt, in order to kings and\r\ngovernors; and that they sub-political laws and commands of those\r\ngovernors, instead of the righteous laws of God, which all mankind ought\r\never to obey, let their kings and governors say what they please to the\r\ncontrary; this preference of human before Divine laws seeming to me the\r\nprincipal character of idolatrous or antichristian nations. Accordingly,\r\nJosephus well observes, Antiq. B. IV. ch. 8. sect. 17, that it was the\r\nduty of the people of Israel to take care that their kings, when they\r\nshould have them, did not exceed their proper limits of power, and prove\r\nungovernable by the laws of God, which would certainly be a most\r\npernicious thing to their Divine settlement. Nor do I think that\r\nnegligence peculiar to the Jews: those nations which are called\r\nChristians, are sometimes indeed very solicitous to restrain their kings\r\nand governors from breaking the human laws of their several kingdoms,\r\nbut without the like care for restraining them from breaking the laws of\r\nGod. \"Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto men more\r\nthan to God, judge ye,\" Acts 4:19. \"We ought to obey God rather than\r\nmen,\" ver. 29.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24 (return) [ What Josephus adds here is very remarkable, that this\r\nMount Moriah was not only the very place where Abraham offered up Isaac\r\nlong ago, but that God had foretold to David by a prophet, that here his\r\nson should build him a temple, which is not directly in any of our other\r\ncopies, though very agreeable to what is in them, particularly in 1\r\nChronicles 21:25, 28; 22:1, to which places I refer the reader.]\r\n\r\n\r\n25 (return) [ Of the quantity of gold and silver expended in the\r\nbuilding of Solomon's temple, and whence it arose, see the description\r\nof ch. 13.]\r\n\r\n\r\n26 (return) [ David is here greatly blamed by some for recommending Joab\r\nand Shimei to be punished by Solomon, if he could find a proper\r\noccasion, after he had borne with the first a long while, and seemed to\r\nhave pardoned the other entirely, which Solomon executed accordingly;\r\nyet I cannot discern any fault either in David or Solomon in these\r\ncases. Joab's murder of Abner and Amasa were very barbarous, and could\r\nnot properly be forgiven either by David or Solomon; for a dispensing\r\npower in kings for the crime of willful murder is warranted by no law of\r\nGod, nay, is directly against it every where; nor is it, for certain, in\r\nthe power of men to grant such a prerogative to any of their kings;\r\nthough Joab was so nearly related to David, and so potent in the army\r\nunder a warlike administration, that David durst not himself put him to\r\ndeath, 2 Samuel 3:39; 19:7. Shimei's cursing the Lord's anointed, and\r\nthis without any just cause, was the highest act of treason against God\r\nand his anointed king, and justly deserved death; and though David could\r\nforgive treason against himself, yet had he done no more in the case of\r\nShimei than promised him that he would not then, on the day of his\r\nreturn and reinauguration, or upon that occasion, himself put him to\r\ndeath, 2 Samuel 19:22; and he swore to him no further, ver. 23, as the\r\nwords are in Josephus, than that he would not then put him to death,\r\nwhich he performed; nor was Solomon under any obligation to spare such a\r\ntraitor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII.

How Solomon, When He Had Received The Kingdom Took Off His\r\nEnemies.\r\n\r\n1. We have already treated of David, and his virtue, and of the benefits\r\nhe was the author of to his countrymen; of his wars also and battles,\r\nwhich he managed with success, and then died an old man, in the\r\nforegoing book. And when Solomon his son, who was but a youth in age,\r\nhad taken the kingdom, and whom David had declared, while he was alive,\r\nthe lord of that people, according to God's will; when he sat upon the\r\nthrone, the whole body of the people made joyful acclamations to him, as\r\nis usual at the beginning of a reign; and wished that all his affairs\r\nmight come to a blessed conclusion; and that he might arrive at a great\r\nage, and at the most happy state of affairs possible.\r\n\r\n2. But Adonijah, who, while his father was living, attempted to gain\r\npossession of the government, came to the king's mother Bathsheba, and\r\nsaluted her with great civility; and when she asked him, whether he came\r\nto her as desiring her assistance in any thing or not, and bade him tell\r\nher if that were the case, for that she would cheerfully afford it him;\r\nhe began to say, that she knew herself that the kingdom was his, both on\r\naccount of his elder age, and of the disposition of the multitude, and\r\nthat yet it was transferred to Solomon her son, according to the will of\r\nGod. He also said that he was contented to be a servant under him, and\r\nwas pleased with the present settlement; but he desired her to be a\r\nmeans of obtaining a favor from his brother to him, and to persuade him\r\nto bestow on him in marriage Abishag, who had indeed slept by his\r\nfather, but, because his father was too old, he did not lie with her,\r\nand she was still a virgin. So Bathsheba promised him to afford him her\r\nassistance very earnestly, and to bring this marriage about, because the\r\nking would be willing to gratify him in such a thing, and because she\r\nwould press it to him very earnestly. Accordingly he went away in hopes\r\nof succeeding in this match. So Solomon's mother went presently to her\r\nson, to speak to him about what she had promised, upon Adonijah's\r\nsupplication to her. And when her son came forward to meet her, and\r\nembraced her, and when he had brought her into the house where his royal\r\nthrone was set, he sat thereon, and bid them set another throne on the\r\nright hand for his mother. When Bathsheba was set down, she said, \"O my\r\nson, grant me one request that I desire of thee, and do not any thing to\r\nme that is disagreeable or ungrateful, which thou wilt do if thou\r\ndeniest me.\" And when Solomon bid her to lay her commands upon him,\r\nbecause it was agreeable to his duty to grant her every thing she should\r\nask, and complained that she did not at first begin her discourse with a\r\nfirm expectation of obtaining what she desired, but had some suspicion\r\nof a denial, she entreated him to grant that his brother Adonijah might\r\nmarry Abishag.\r\n\r\n3. But the king was greatly offended at these words, and sent away his\r\nmother, and said that Adonijah aimed at great things; and that he\r\nwondered that she did not desire him to yield up the kingdom to him, as\r\nto his elder brother, since she desired that he might marry Abishag; and\r\nthat he had potent friends, Joab the captain of the host, and Abiathar\r\nthe priest. So he called for Benaiah, the captain of the guards, and\r\nordered him to slay his brother Adonijah. He also called for Abiathar\r\nthe priest, and said to him, \"I will not put thee to death because of\r\nthose other hardships which thou hast endured with my father, and\r\nbecause of the ark which thou hast borne along with him; but I inflict\r\nthis following punishment upon thee, because thou wast among Adonijah's\r\nfollowers, and wast of his party. Do not thou continue here, nor come\r\nany more into my sight, but go to thine own town, and live on thy own\r\nfields, and there abide all thy life; for thou hast offended so greatly,\r\nthat it is not just that thou shouldst retain thy dignity any longer.\"\r\nFor the forementioned cause, therefore, it was that the house of Ithamar\r\nwas deprived of the sacerdotal dignity, as God had foretold to Eli, the\r\ngrandfather of Abiathar. So it was transferred to the family of Phineas,\r\nto Zadok. Now those that were of the family of Phineas, but lived\r\nprivately during the time that the high priesthood was transferred to\r\nthe house of Ithamar, [of which family Eli was the first that received\r\nit,]were these that follow: Bukki, the son of Abishua the high priest;\r\nhis son was Joatham; Joatham's son was Meraioth; Meraioth's son was\r\nArophseus; Aropheus's son was Ahitub; and Ahitub's son was Zadok, who\r\nwas first made high priest in the reign of David.\r\n\r\n4. Now when Joab the captain of the host heard of the slaughter of\r\nAdonijah, he was greatly afraid, for he was a greater friend to him than\r\nto Solomon; and suspecting, not without reason, that he was in danger,\r\non account of his favor to Adonijah, he fled to the altar, and supposed\r\nhe might procure safety thereby to himself, because of the king's piety\r\ntowards God. But when some told the king what Joab's supposal was, he\r\nsent Benaiah, and commanded him to raise him up from the altar, and\r\nbring him to the judgment-seat, in order to make his defense. However,\r\nJoab said he would not leave the altar, but would die there rather than\r\nin another place. And when Benaiah had reported his answer to the king,\r\nSolomon commanded him to cut off his head there 1 and let him take that\r\nas a punishment for those two captains of the host whom he had wickedly\r\nslain, and to bury his body, that his sins might never leave his family,\r\nbut that himself and his father, by Joab's death, might be guiltless.\r\nAnd when Benaiah had done what he was commanded to do, he was himself\r\nappointed to be captain of the whole army. The king also made Zadok to\r\nbe alone the high priest, in the room of Abiathar, whom he had removed.\r\n\r\n5. But as to Shimei, Solomon commanded that he should build him a house,\r\nand stay at Jerusalem, and attend upon him, and should not have\r\nauthority to go over the brook Cedron; and that if he disobeyed that\r\ncommand, death should be his punishment. He also threatened him so\r\nterribly, that he compelled him to take all oath that he would obey.\r\nAccordingly Shimei said that he had reason to thank Solomon for giving\r\nhim such an injunction; and added an oath, that he would do as he bade\r\nhim; and leaving his own country, he made his abode in Jerusalem. But\r\nthree years afterwards, when he heard that two of his servants were run\r\naway from him, and were in Gath, he went for his servants in haste; and\r\nwhen he was come back with them, the king perceived it, and was much\r\ndispleased that he had contemned his commands, and, what was more, had\r\nno regard to the oaths he had sworn to God; so he called him, and said\r\nto him, \"Didst not thou swear never to leave me, nor to go out of this\r\ncity to another? Thou shalt not therefore escape punishment for thy\r\nperjury, but I will punish thee, thou wicked wretch, both for this\r\ncrime, and for those wherewith thou didst abuse my father when he was in\r\nhis flight, that thou mayst know that wicked men gain nothing at last,\r\nalthough they be not punished immediately upon their unjust practices;\r\nbut that in all the time wherein they think themselves secure, because\r\nthey have yet suffered nothing, their punishment increases, and is\r\nheavier upon them, and that to a greater degree than if they had been\r\npunished immediately upon the commission of their crimes.\" So Benaiah,\r\non the king's command, slew Shimei.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. Concerning The Wife Of Solomon; Concerning His Wisdom And\r\nRiches; And Concerning What He Obtained Of Hiram For The Building Of The\r\nTemple.\r\n\r\n1. Solomon having already settled himself firmly in his kingdom, and\r\nhaving brought his enemies to punishment, he married the daughter of\r\nPharaoh king of Egypt, and built the walls of Jerusalem much larger and\r\nstronger than those that had been before, 2 and thenceforward he managed\r\npublic affairs very peaceably. Nor was his youth any hinderance in the\r\nexercise of justice, or in the observation of the laws, or in the\r\nremembrance of what charges his father had given him at his death; but\r\nhe discharged every duty with great accuracy, that might have been\r\nexpected from such as are aged, and of the greatest prudence. He now\r\nresolved to go to Hebron, and sacrifice to God upon the brazen altar\r\nthat was built by Moses. Accordingly he offered there burnt-offerings,\r\nin number a thousand; and when he had done this, he thought he had paid\r\ngreat honor to God; for as he was asleep that very night God appeared to\r\nhim, and commanded him to ask of him some gifts which he was ready to\r\ngive him as a reward for his piety. So Solomon asked of God what was\r\nmost excellent, and of the greatest worth in itself, what God would\r\nbestow with the greatest joy, and what it was most profitable for man to\r\nreceive; for he did not desire to have bestowed upon him either gold or\r\nsilver, or any other riches, as a man and a youth might naturally have\r\ndone, for these are the things that generally are esteemed by most men,\r\nas alone of the greatest worth, and the best gifts of God; but, said he,\r\n\"Give me, O Lord, a sound mind, and a good understanding, whereby I may\r\nspeak and judge the people according to truth and righteousness.\" With\r\nthese petitions God was well pleased; and promised to give him all those\r\nthings that he had not mentioned in his option, riches, glory, victory\r\nover his enemies; and, in the first place, understanding and wisdom, and\r\nthis in such a degree as no other mortal man, neither kings nor ordinary\r\npersons, ever had. He also promised to preserve the kingdom to his\r\nposterity for a very long time, if he continued righteous and obedient\r\nto him, and imitated his father in those things wherein he excelled.\r\nWhen Solomon heard this from God, he presently leaped out of his bed;\r\nand when he had worshipped him, he returned to Jerusalem; and after he\r\nhad offered great sacrifices before the tabernacle, he feasted all his\r\nown family.\r\n\r\n2. In these days a hard cause came before him in judgment, which it was\r\nvery difficult to find any end of; and I think it necessary to explain\r\nthe fact about which the contest was, that such as light upon my\r\nwritings may know what a difficult cause Solomon was to determine, and\r\nthose that are concerned in such matters may take this sagacity of the\r\nking for a pattern, that they may the more easily give sentence about\r\nsuch questions. There were two women, who were harlots in the course of\r\ntheir lives, that came to him; of whom she that seemed to be injured\r\nbegan to speak first, and said, \"O king, I and this other woman dwell\r\ntogether in one room. Now it came to pass that we both bore a son at the\r\nsame hour of the same day; and on the third day this woman overlaid her\r\nson, and killed it, and then took my son out of my bosom, and removed\r\nhim to herself, and as I was asleep she laid her dead son in my arms.\r\nNow, when in the morning I was desirous to give the breast to the child,\r\nI did not find my own, but saw the woman's dead child lying by me; for I\r\nconsidered it exactly, and found it so to be. Hence it was that I\r\ndemanded my son, and when I could not obtain him, I have recourse, my\r\nlord, to thy assistance; for since we were alone, and there was nobody\r\nthere that could convict her, she cares for nothing, but perseveres in\r\nthe stout denial of the fact.\" When this woman had told this her story,\r\nthe king asked the other woman what she had to say in contradiction to\r\nthat story. But when she denied that she had done what was charged upon\r\nher, and said that it was her child that was living, and that it was her\r\nantagonist's child that was dead, and when no one could devise what\r\njudgment could be given, and the whole court were blind in their\r\nunderstanding, and could not tell how to find out this riddle, the king\r\nalone invented the following way how to discover it. He bade them bring\r\nin both the dead child and the living child; and sent one of his guards,\r\nand commanded him to fetch a sword, and draw it, and to cut both the\r\nchildren into two pieces, that each of the women might have half the\r\nliving and half the dead child. Hereupon all the people privately\r\nlaughed at the king, as no more than a youth. But, in the mean time, she\r\nthat was the real mother of the living child cried out that he should\r\nnot do so, but deliver that child to the other woman as her own, for she\r\nwould be satisfied with the life of the child, and with the sight of it,\r\nalthough it were esteemed the other's child; but the other woman was\r\nready to see the child divided, and was desirous, moreover, that the\r\nfirst woman should be tormented. When the king understood that both\r\ntheir words proceeded from the truth of their passions, he adjudged the\r\nchild to her that cried out to save it, for that she was the real mother\r\nof it; and he condemned the other as a wicked woman, who had not only\r\nkilled her own child, but was endeavoring to see her friend's child\r\ndestroyed also. Now the multitude looked on this determination as a\r\ngreat sign and demonstration of the king's sagacity and wisdom, and\r\nafter that day attended to him as to one that had a divine mind.\r\n\r\n3. Now the captains of his armies, and officers appointed over the whole\r\ncountry, were these: over the lot of Ephraim was Ures; over the toparchy\r\nof Bethlehem was Dioclerus; Abinadab, who married Solomon's daughter,\r\nhad the region of Dora and the sea-coast under him; the Great Plain was\r\nunder Benaiah, the son of Achilus; he also governed all the country as\r\nfar as Jordan; Gabaris ruled over Gilead and Gaulanitis, and had under\r\nhim the sixty great and fenced cities [of Og]; Achinadab managed the\r\naffairs of all Galilee as far as Sidon, and had himself also married a\r\ndaughter of Solomon's, whose name was Basima; Banacates had the seacoast\r\nabout Arce; as had Shaphat Mount Tabor, and Carmel, and [the Lower]\r\nGalilee, as far as the river Jordan; one man was appointed over all this\r\ncountry; Shimei was intrusted with the lot of Benjamin; and Gabares had\r\nthe country beyond Jordan, over whom there was again one governor\r\nappointed. Now the people of the Hebrews, and particularly the tribe of\r\nJudah, received a wonderful increase when they betook themselves to\r\nhusbandry, and the cultivation of their grounds; for as they enjoyed\r\npeace, and were not distracted with wars and troubles, and having,\r\nbesides, an abundant fruition of the most desirable liberty, every one\r\nwas busy in augmenting the product of their own lands, and making them\r\nworth more than they had formerly been.\r\n\r\n4. The king had also other rulers, who were over the land of Syria and\r\nof the Philistines, which reached from the river Euphrates to Egypt, and\r\nthese collected his tributes of the nations. Now these contributed to\r\nthe king's table, and to his supper every day 3 thirty cori of fine\r\nflour, and sixty of meal; as also ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of\r\nthe pastures, and a hundred fat lambs; all these were besides what were\r\ntaken by hunting harts and buffaloes, and birds and fishes, which were\r\nbrought to the king by foreigners day by day. Solomon had also so great\r\na number of chariots, that the stalls of his horses for those chariots\r\nwere forty thousand; and besides these he had twelve thousand horsemen,\r\nthe one half of which waited upon the king in Jerusalem, and the rest\r\nwere dispersed abroad, and dwelt in the royal villages; but the same\r\nofficer who provided for the king's expenses supplied also the fodder\r\nfor the horses, and still carried it to the place where the king abode\r\nat that time.\r\n\r\n5. Now the sagacity and wisdom which God had bestowed on Solomon was so\r\ngreat, that he exceeded the ancients; insomuch that he was no way\r\ninferior to the Egyptians, who are said to have been beyond all men in\r\nunderstanding; nay, indeed, it is evident that their sagacity was very\r\nmuch inferior to that of the king's. He also excelled and distinguished\r\nhimself in wisdom above those who were most eminent among the Hebrews at\r\nthat time for shrewdness; those I mean were Ethan, and Heman, and\r\nChalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol. He also composed books of odes\r\nand songs a thousand and five, of parables and similitudes three\r\nthousand; for he spake a parable upon every sort of tree, from the\r\nhyssop to the cedar; and in like manner also about beasts, about all\r\nsorts of living creatures, whether upon the earth, or in the seas, or in\r\nthe air; for he was not unacquainted with any of their natures, nor\r\nomitted inquiries about them, but described them all like a philosopher,\r\nand demonstrated his exquisite knowledge of their several properties.\r\nGod also enabled him to learn that skill which expels demons, 4 which is\r\na science useful and sanative to men. He composed such incantations also\r\nby which distempers are alleviated. And he left behind him the manner of\r\nusing exorcisms, by which they drive away demons, so that they never\r\nreturn; and this method of cure is of great force unto this day; for I\r\nhave seen a certain man of my own country, whose name was Eleazar,\r\nreleasing people that were demoniacal in the presence of Vespasian, and\r\nhis sons, and his captains, and the whole multitude of his soldiers. The\r\nmanner of the cure was this: He put a ring that had a Foot of one of\r\nthose sorts mentioned by Solomon to the nostrils of the demoniac, after\r\nwhich he drew out the demon through his nostrils; and when the man fell\r\ndown immediately, he abjured him to return into him no more, making\r\nstill mention of Solomon, and reciting the incantations which he\r\ncomposed. And when Eleazar would persuade and demonstrate to the\r\nspectators that he had such a power, he set a little way off a cup or\r\nbasin full of water, and commanded the demon, as he went out of the man,\r\nto overturn it, and thereby to let the spectators know that he had left\r\nthe man; and when this was done, the skill and wisdom of Solomon was\r\nshown very manifestly: for which reason it is, that all men may know the\r\nvastness of Solomon's abilities, and how he was beloved of God, and that\r\nthe extraordinary virtues of every kind with which this king was endowed\r\nmay not be unknown to any people under the sun for this reason, I say,\r\nit is that we have proceeded to speak so largely of these matters.\r\n\r\n6. Moreover Hiram, king of Tyre, when he had heard that Solomon\r\nsucceeded to his father's kingdom, was very glad of it, for he was a\r\nfriend of David's. So he sent ambassadors to him, and saluted him, and\r\ncongratulated him on the present happy state of his affairs. Upon which\r\nSolomon sent him an epistle, the contents of which here follow:\r\n\r\nSolomon To King Hiram.\r\n\r\n\"5 Know thou that my father would have built a temple to God, but was\r\nhindered by wars, and continual expeditions; for he did not leave off to\r\noverthrow his enemies till he made them all subject to tribute. But I\r\ngive thanks to God for the peace I at present enjoy, and on that account\r\nI am at leisure, and design to build a house to God, for God foretold to\r\nmy father that such a house should be built by me; wherefore I desire\r\nthee to send some of thy subjects with mine to Mount Lebanon to cut down\r\ntimber, for the Sidonians are more skillful than our people in cutting\r\nof wood. As for wages to the hewers of wood, I will pay whatsoever price\r\nthou shalt determine.\"\r\n\r\n7. When Hiram had read this epistle, he was pleased with it; and wrote\r\nback this answer to Solomon.\r\n\r\nHiram To King Solomon.\r\n\r\n\"It is fit to bless God that he hath committed thy father's government\r\nto thee, who art a wise man, and endowed with all virtues. As for\r\nmyself, I rejoice at the condition thou art in, and will be subservient\r\nto thee in all that thou sendest to me about; for when by my subjects I\r\nhave cut down many and large trees of cedar and cypress wood, I will\r\nsend them to sea, and will order my subjects to make floats of them, and\r\nto sail to what place soever of thy country thou shalt desire, and leave\r\nthem there, after which thy subjects may carry them to Jerusalem. But do\r\nthou take care to procure us corn for this timber, which we stand in\r\nneed of, because we inhabit in an island.\"\r\n\r\n8. The copies of these epistles remain at this day, and are preserved\r\nnot only in our books, but among the Tyrians also; insomuch that if any\r\none would know the certainty about them, he may desire of the keepers of\r\nthe public records of Tyre to show him them, and he will find what is\r\nthere set down to agree with what we have said. I have said so much out\r\nof a desire that my readers may know that we speak nothing but the\r\ntruth, and do not compose a history out of some plausible relations,\r\nwhich deceive men and please them at the same time, nor attempt to avoid\r\nexamination, nor desire men to believe us immediately; nor are we at\r\nliberty to depart from speaking truth, which is the proper commendation\r\nof an historian, and yet be blameless: but we insist upon no admission\r\nof what we say, unless we be able to manifest its truth by\r\ndemonstration, and the strongest vouchers.\r\n\r\n9. Now king Solomon, as soon as this epistle of the king of Tyre was\r\nbrought him, commended the readiness and good-will he declared therein,\r\nand repaid him in what he desired, and sent him yearly twenty thousand\r\ncori of wheat, and as many baths of oil: now the bath is able to contain\r\nseventy-two sextaries. He also sent him the same measure of wine. So the\r\nfriendship between Hiram and Solomon hereby increased more and more; and\r\nthey swore to continue it for ever. And the king appointed a tribute to\r\nbe laid on all the people, of thirty thousand laborers, whose work he\r\nrendered easy to them by prudently dividing it among them; for he made\r\nten thousand cut timber in Mount Lebanon for one month; and then to come\r\nhome, and rest two months, until the time when the other twenty thousand\r\nhad finished their task at the appointed time; and so afterward it came\r\nto pass that the first ten thousand returned to their work every fourth\r\nmonth: and it was Adoram who was over this tribute. There were also of\r\nthe strangers who were left by David, who were to carry the stones and\r\nother materials, seventy thousand; and of those that cut the stones,\r\neighty thousand. Of these three thousand and three hundred were rulers\r\nover the rest. He also enjoined them to cut out large stones for the\r\nfoundations of the temple, and that they should fit them and unite them\r\ntogether in the mountain, and so bring them to the city. This was done\r\nnot only by our own country workmen, but by those workmen whom Hiram\r\nsent also. 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. Of The Building Of This Temple\r\n\r\n1. Solomon began to build the temple in the fourth year of his reign, on\r\nthe second month, which the Macedonians call Artemisius, and the Hebrews\r\nJur, five hundred and ninety-two years after the Exodus out of Egypt;\r\nbut one thousand and twenty years from Abraham's coming out of\r\nMesopotamia into Canaan, and after the deluge one thousand four hundred\r\nand forty years; and from Adam, the first man who was created, until\r\nSolomon built the temple, there had passed in all three thousand one\r\nhundred and two years. Now that year on which the temple began to be\r\nbuilt was already the eleventh year of the reign of Hiram; but from the\r\nbuilding of Tyre to the building of the temple, there had passed two\r\nhundred and forty years.\r\n\r\n2. Now, therefore, the king laid the foundations of the temple very deep\r\nin the ground, and the materials were strong stones, and such as would\r\nresist the force of time; these were to unite themselves with the earth,\r\nand become a basis and a sure foundation for that superstructure which\r\nwas to be erected over it; they were to be so strong, in order to\r\nsustain with ease those vast superstructures and precious ornaments,\r\nwhose own weight was to be not less than the weight of those other high\r\nand heavy buildings which the king designed to be very ornamental and\r\nmagnificent. They erected its entire body, quite up to the roof, of\r\nwhite stone; its height was sixty cubits, and its length was the same,\r\nand its breadth twenty. There was another building erected over it,\r\nequal to it in its measures; so that the entire altitude of the temple\r\nwas a hundred and twenty cubits. Its front was to the east. As to the\r\nporch, they built it before the temple; its length was twenty cubits,\r\nand it was so ordered that it might agree with the breadth of the house;\r\nand it had twelve cubits in latitude, and its height was raised as high\r\nas a hundred and twenty cubits. He also built round about the temple\r\nthirty small rooms, which might include the whole temple, by their\r\ncloseness one to another, and by their number and outward position round\r\nit. He also made passages through them, that they might come into on\r\nthrough another. Every one of these rooms had five cubits in breadth, 7\r\nand the same in length, but in height twenty. Above these there were\r\nother rooms, and others above them, equal, both in their measures and\r\nnumber; so that these reached to a height equal to the lower part of the\r\nhouse; for the upper part had no buildings about it. The roof that was\r\nover the house was of cedar; and truly every one of these rooms had a\r\nroof of their own, that was not connected with the other rooms; but for\r\nthe other parts, there was a covered roof common to them all, and built\r\nwith very long beams, that passed through the rest, and through the\r\nwhole building, that so the middle walls, being strengthened by the same\r\nbeams of timber, might be thereby made firmer: but as for that part of\r\nthe roof that was under the beams, it was made of the same materials,\r\nand was all made smooth, and had ornaments proper for roofs, and plates\r\nof gold nailed upon them. And as he enclosed the walls with boards of\r\ncedar, so he fixed on them plates of gold, which had sculptures upon\r\nthem; so that the whole temple shined, and dazzled the eyes of such as\r\nentered, by the splendor of the gold that was on every side of them, Now\r\nthe whole structure of the temple was made with great skill of polished\r\nstones, and those laid together so very harmoniously and smoothly, that\r\nthere appeared to the spectators no sign of any hammer, or other\r\ninstrument of architecture; but as if, without any use of them, the\r\nentire materials had naturally united themselves together, that the\r\nagreement of one part with another seemed rather to have been natural,\r\nthan to have arisen from the force of tools upon them. The king also had\r\na fine contrivance for an ascent to the upper room over the temple, and\r\nthat was by steps in the thickness of its wall; for it had no large door\r\non the east end, as the lower house had, but the entrances were by the\r\nsides, through very small doors. He also overlaid the temple, both\r\nwithin and without, with boards of cedar, that were kept close together\r\nby thick chains, so that this contrivance was in the nature of a support\r\nand a strength to the building.\r\n\r\n3. Now when the king had divided the temple into two parts, he made the\r\ninner house of twenty cubits [every way], to be the most secret chamber,\r\nbut he appointed that of forty cubits to be the sanctuary; and when he\r\nhad cut a door-place out of the wall, he put therein doors of Cedar, and\r\noverlaid them with a great deal of gold, that had sculptures upon it. He\r\nalso had veils of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and the brightest and\r\nsoftest linen, with the most curious flowers wrought upon them, which\r\nwere to be drawn before those doors. He also dedicated for the most\r\nsecret place, whose breadth was twenty cubits, and length the same, two\r\ncherubims of solid gold; the height of each of them was five cubits 8\r\nthey had each of them two wings stretched out as far as five cubits;\r\nwherefore Solomon set them up not far from each other, that with one\r\nwing they might touch the southern wall of the secret place, and with\r\nanother the northern: their other wings, which joined to each other,\r\nwere a covering to the ark, which was set between them; but nobody can\r\ntell, or even conjecture, what was the shape of these cherubims. He also\r\nlaid the floor of the temple with plates of gold; and he added doors to\r\nthe gate of the temple, agreeable to the measure of the height of the\r\nwall, but in breadth twenty cubits, and on them he glued gold plates.\r\nAnd, to say all in one word, he left no part of the temple, neither\r\ninternal nor external, but what was covered with gold. He also had\r\ncurtains drawn over these doors in like manner as they were drawn over\r\nthe inner doors of the most holy place; but the porch of the temple had\r\nnothing of that sort.\r\n\r\n4. Now Solomon sent for an artificer out of Tyre, whose name was Hiram;\r\nhe was by birth of the tribe of Naphtali, on the mother's side, [for she\r\nwas of that tribe,] but his father was Ur, of the stock of the\r\nIsraelites. This man was skillful in all sorts of work; but his chief\r\nskill lay in working in gold, and silver, and brass; by whom were made\r\nall the mechanical works about the temple, according to the will of\r\nSolomon. Moreover, this Hiram made two [hollow] pillars, whose outsides\r\nwere of brass, and the thickness of the brass was four fingers' breadth,\r\nand the height of the pillars was eighteen cubits and their\r\ncircumference twelve cubits; but there was cast with each of their\r\nchapiters lily-work that stood upon the pillar, and it was elevated five\r\ncubits, round about which there was net-work interwoven with small\r\npalms, made of brass, and covered the lily-work. To this also were hung\r\ntwo hundred pomegranates, in two rows. The one of these pillars he set\r\nat the entrance of the porch on the right hand, and called it Jachin 9\r\nand the other at the left hand, and called it Booz.\r\n\r\n5. Solomon also cast a brazen sea, whose figure was that of a\r\nhemisphere. This brazen vessel was called a sea for its largeness, for\r\nthe laver was ten feet in diameter, and cast of the thickness of a palm.\r\nIts middle part rested on a short pillar that had ten spirals round it,\r\nand that pillar was ten cubits in diameter. There stood round about it\r\ntwelve oxen, that looked to the four winds of heaven, three to each\r\nwind, having their hinder parts depressed, that so the hemispherical\r\nvessel might rest upon them, which itself was also depressed round about\r\ninwardly. Now this sea contained three thousand baths.\r\n\r\n6. He also made ten brazen bases for so many quadrangular lavers; the\r\nlength of every one of these bases was five cubits, and the breadth four\r\ncubits, and the height six cubits. This vessel was partly turned, and\r\nwas thus contrived: There were four small quadrangular pillars that\r\nstood one at each corner; these had the sides of the base fitted to them\r\non each quarter; they were parted into three parts; every interval had a\r\nborder fitted to support [the laver]; upon which was engraven, in one\r\nplace a lion, and in another place a bull, and an eagle. The small\r\npillars had the same animals engraven that were engraven on the sides.\r\nThe whole work was elevated, and stood upon four wheels, which were also\r\ncast, which had also naves and felloes, and were a foot and a half in\r\ndiameter. Any one who saw the spokes of the wheels, how exactly they\r\nwere turned, and united to the sides of the bases, and with what harmony\r\nthey agreed to the felloes, would wonder at them. However, their\r\nstructure was this: Certain shoulders of hands stretched out held the\r\ncorners above, upon which rested a short spiral pillar, that lay under\r\nthe hollow part of the laver, resting upon the fore part of the eagle\r\nand the lion, which were adapted to them, insomuch that those who viewed\r\nthem would think they were of one piece: between these were engravings\r\nof palm trees. This was the construction of the ten bases. He also made\r\nten large round brass vessels, which were the lavers themselves, each of\r\nwhich contained forty baths; 10 for it had its height four cubits, and\r\nits edges were as much distant from each other. He also placed these\r\nlavers upon the ten bases that were called Mechonoth; and he set five of\r\nthe lavers on the left side of the temple 11 which was that side towards\r\nthe north wind, and as many on the right side, towards the south, but\r\nlooking towards the east; the same [eastern] way he also set the sea.\r\nNow he appointed the sea to be for washing the hands and the feet of the\r\npriests, when they entered into the temple and were to ascend the altar,\r\nbut the lavers to cleanse the entrails of the beasts that were to be\r\nburnt-offerings, with their feet also.\r\n\r\n7. He also made a brazen altar, whose length was twenty cubits, and its\r\nbreadth the same, and its height ten, for the burnt-offerings. He also\r\nmade all its vessels of brass, the pots, and the shovels, and the\r\nbasons; and besides these, the snuffers and the tongs, and all its other\r\nvessels, he made of brass, and such brass as was in splendor and beauty\r\nlike gold. The king also dedicated a great number of tables, but one\r\nthat was large and made of gold, upon which they set the loaves of God;\r\nand he made ten thousand more that resembled them, but were done after\r\nanother manner, upon which lay the vials and the cups; those of gold\r\nwere twenty thousand, those of silver were forty thousand. He also made\r\nten thousand candlesticks, according to the command of Moses, one of\r\nwhich he dedicated for the temple, that it might burn in the day time,\r\naccording to the law; and one table with loaves upon it, on the north\r\nside of the temple, over against the candlestick; for this he set on the\r\nsouth side, but the golden altar stood between them. All these vessels\r\nwere contained in that part of the holy house, which was forty cubits\r\nlong, and were before the veil of that most secret place wherein the ark\r\nwas to be set.\r\n\r\n8. The king also made pouring vessels, in number eighty thousand, and a\r\nhundred thousand golden vials, and twice as many silver vials: of golden\r\ndishes, in order therein to offer kneaded fine flour at the altar, there\r\nwere eighty thousand, and twice as many of silver. Of large basons also,\r\nwherein they mixed fine flour with oil, sixty thousand of gold, and\r\ntwice as many of silver. Of the measures like those which Moses called\r\nthe Hin and the Assaron, [a tenth deal,] there were twenty thousand of\r\ngold, and twice as many of silver. The golden censers, in which they\r\ncarried the incense to the altar, were twenty thousand; the other\r\ncensers, in which they carried fire from the great altar to the little\r\naltar, within the temple, were fifty thousand. The sacerdotal garments\r\nwhich belonged to the high priest, with the long robes, and the oracle,\r\nand the precious stones, were a thousand. But the crown upon which Moses\r\nwrote [the name of God] was only one, and hath remained to this very\r\nday. He also made ten thousand sacerdotal garments of fine linen, with\r\npurple girdles for every priest; and two hundred thousand trumpets,\r\naccording to the command of Moses; also two hundred thousand garments of\r\nfine linen for the singers, that were Levites. And he made musical\r\ninstruments, and such as were invented for singing of hymns, called\r\nNablee and Cindree, [psalteries and harps,] which were made of electrum,\r\n[the finest brass,] forty thousand.\r\n\r\n9. Solomon made all these things for the honor of God, with great\r\nvariety and magnificence, sparing no cost, but using all possible\r\nliberality in adorning the temple; and these things he dedicated to the\r\ntreasures of God. He also placed a partition round about the temple,\r\nwhich in our tongue we call Gison, but it is called Thrigcos by the\r\nGreeks, and he raised it up to the height of three cubits; and it was\r\nfor the exclusion of the multitude from coming into the temple, and\r\nshowing that it was a place that was free and open only for the priests.\r\nHe also built beyond this court a temple, whose figure was that of a\r\nquadrangle, and erected for it great and broad cloisters; this was\r\nentered into by very high gates, each of which had its front exposed to\r\none of the [four] winds, and were shut by golden doors. Into this temple\r\nall the people entered that were distinguished from the rest by being\r\npure and observant of the laws. But he made that temple which was beyond\r\nthis a wonderful one indeed, and such as exceeds all description in\r\nwords; nay, if I may so say, is hardly believed upon sight; for when he\r\nhad filled up great valleys with earth, which, on account of their\r\nimmense depth, could not be looked on, when you bended down to see them,\r\nwithout pain, and had elevated the ground four hundred cubits, he made\r\nit to be on a level with the top of the mountain, on which the temple\r\nwas built, and by this means the outmost temple, which was exposed to\r\nthe air, was even with the temple itself. He encompassed this also with\r\na building of a double row of cloisters, which stood on high upon\r\npillars of native stone, while the roofs were of cedar, and were\r\npolished in a manner proper for such high roofs; but he made all the\r\ndoors of this temple of silver. 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How Solomon Removed The Ark Into The Temple How He Made\r\nSupplication To God, And Offered Public Sacrifices To Him.\r\n\r\n1. When king Solomon had finished these works, these large and beautiful\r\nbuildings, and had laid up his donations in the temple, and all this in\r\nthe interval of seven years, and had given a demonstration of his riches\r\nand alacrity therein, insomuch that any one who saw it would have\r\nthought it must have been an immense time ere it could have been\r\nfinished; and would be surprised that so much should be finished in so\r\nshort a time; short, I mean, if compared with the greatness of the work:\r\nhe also wrote to the rulers and elders of the Hebrews, and ordered all\r\nthe people to gather themselves together to Jerusalem, both to see the\r\ntemple which he had built, and to remove the ark of God into it; and\r\nwhen this invitation of the whole body of the people to come to\r\nJerusalem was every where carried abroad, it was the seventh month\r\nbefore they came together; which month is by our countrymen called\r\nThisri, but by the Macedonians Hyperberetoets. The feast of tabernacles\r\nhappened to fall at the same time, which was celebrated by the Hebrews\r\nas a most holy and most eminent feast. So they carried the ark and the\r\ntabernacle which Moses had pitched, and all the vessels that were for\r\nministration, to the sacrifices of God, and removed them to the temple.\r\n13 The king himself, and all the people and the Levites, went before,\r\nrendering the ground moist with sacrifices, and drink-offerings, and the\r\nblood of a great number of oblations, and burning an immense quantity of\r\nincense, and this till the very air itself every where round about was\r\nso full of these odors, that it met, in a most agreeable manner, persons\r\nat a great distance, and was an indication of God's presence; and, as\r\nmen's opinion was, of his habitation with them in this newly built and\r\nconsecrated place, for they did not grow weary, either of singing hymns\r\nor of dancing, until they came to the temple; and in this manner did\r\nthey carry the ark. But when they should transfer it into the most\r\nsecret place, the rest of the multitude went away, and only those\r\npriests that carried it set it between the two cherubims, which\r\nembracing it with their wings, [for so were they framed by the\r\nartificer,] they covered it, as under a tent, or a cupola. Now the ark\r\ncontained nothing else but those two tables of stone that preserved the\r\nten commandments, which God spake to Moses in Mount Sinai, and which\r\nwere engraved upon them; but they set the candlestick, and the table,\r\nand the golden altar in the temple, before the most secret place, in the\r\nvery same places wherein they stood till that time in the tabernacle. So\r\nthey offered up the daily sacrifices; but for the brazen altar, Solomon\r\nset it before the temple, over against the door, that when the door was\r\nopened, it might be exposed to sight, and the sacred solemnities, and\r\nthe richness of the sacrifices, might be thence seen; and all the rest\r\nof the vessels they gathered together, and put them within the temple.\r\n\r\n2. Now as soon as the priests had put all things in order about the ark,\r\nand were gone out, there came down a thick cloud, and stood there, and\r\nspread itself, after a gentle manner, into the temple; such a cloud it\r\nwas as was diffused and temperate, not such a rough one as we see full\r\nof rain in the winter season. This cloud so darkened the place, that one\r\npriest could not discern another, but it afforded to the minds of all a\r\nvisible image and glorious appearance of God's having descended into\r\nthis temple, and of his having gladly pitched his tabernacle therein. So\r\nthese men were intent upon this thought. But Solomon rose up, [for he\r\nwas sitting before,] and used such words to God as he thought agreeable\r\nto the Divine nature to receive, and fit for him to give; for he said,\r\n\"Thou hast an eternal house, O Lord, and such a one as thou hast created\r\nfor thyself out of thine own works; we know it to be the heaven, and the\r\nair, and the earth, and the sea, which thou pervadest, nor art thou\r\ncontained within their limits. I have indeed built this temple to thee,\r\nand thy name, that from thence, when we sacrifice, and perform sacred\r\noperations, we may send our prayers up into the air, and may constantly\r\nbelieve that thou art present, and art not remote from what is thine\r\nown; for neither when thou seest all things, and hearest all things, nor\r\nnow, when it pleases thee to dwell here, dost thou leave the care of all\r\nmen, but rather thou art very near to them all, but especially thou art\r\npresent to those that address themselves to thee, whether by night or by\r\nday.\" When he had thus solemnly addressed himself to God, he converted\r\nhis discourse to the multitude, and strongly represented the power and\r\nprovidence of God to them;—how he had shown all things that were come to\r\npass to David his father, as many of those things had already come to\r\npass, and the rest would certainly come to pass hereafter; and how he\r\nhad given him his name, and told to David what he should be called\r\nbefore he was born; and foretold, that when he should be king after his\r\nfather's death, he should build him a temple, which since they saw\r\naccomplished, according to his prediction, he required them to bless\r\nGod, and by believing him, from the sight of what they had seen\r\naccomplished, never to despair of any thing that he had promised for the\r\nfuture, in order to their happiness, or suspect that it would not come\r\nto pass.\r\n\r\n3. When the king had thus discoursed to the multitude, he looked again\r\ntowards the temple, and lifting up his right hand to the multitude, he\r\nsaid, \"It is not possible by what men can do to return sufficient thanks\r\nto God for his benefits bestowed upon them, for the Deity stands in need\r\nof nothing, and is above any such requital; but so far as we have been\r\nmade superior, O Lord, to other animals by thee, it becomes us to bless\r\nthy Majesty, and it is necessary for us to return thee thanks for what\r\nthou hast bestowed upon our house, and on the Hebrew people; for with\r\nwhat other instrument can we better appease thee when thou art angry at\r\nus, or more properly preserve thy favor, than with our voice? which, as\r\nwe have it from the air, so do we know that by that air it ascends\r\nupwards [towards thee]. I therefore ought myself to return thee thanks\r\nthereby, in the first place, concerning my father, whom thou hast raised\r\nfrom obscurity unto so great joy; and, in the next place, concerning\r\nmyself, since thou hast performed all that thou hast promised unto this\r\nvery day. And I beseech thee for the time to come to afford us\r\nwhatsoever thou, O God, hast power to bestow on such as thou dost\r\nesteem; and to augment our house for all ages, as thou hast promised to\r\nDavid my father to do, both in his lifetime and at his death, that our\r\nkingdom shall continue, and that his posterity should successively\r\nreceive it to ten thousand generations. Do not thou therefore fail to\r\ngive us these blessings, and to bestow on my children that virtue in\r\nwhich thou delightest. And besides all this, I humbly beseech thee that\r\nthou wilt let some portion of thy Spirit come down and inhabit in this\r\ntemple, that thou mayst appear to be with us upon earth. As to thyself,\r\nthe entire heavens, and the immensity of the things that are therein,\r\nare but a small habitation for thee, much more is this poor temple so;\r\nbut I entreat thee to keep it as thine own house, from being destroyed\r\nby our enemies for ever, and to take care of it as thine own possession:\r\nbut if this people be found to have sinned, and be thereupon afflicted\r\nby thee with any plague, because of their sin, as with dearth or\r\npestilence, or any other affliction which thou usest to inflict on those\r\nthat transgress any of thy holy laws, and if they fly all of them to\r\nthis temple, beseeching thee, and begging of time to deliver them, then\r\ndo thou hear their prayers, as being within thine house, and have mercy\r\nupon them, and deliver them from their afflictions. Nay, moreover, this\r\nhelp is what I implore of thee, not for the Hebrews only, when they are\r\nin distress, but when any shall come hither from any ends of the world\r\nwhatsoever, and shall return from their sins and implore thy pardon, do\r\nthou then pardon them, and hear their prayer. For hereby all shall learn\r\nthat thou thyself wast pleased with the building of this house for thee;\r\nand that we are not ourselves of an unsociable nature, nor behave\r\nourselves like enemies to such as are not of our own people; but are\r\nwilling that thy assistance should be communicated by thee to all men in\r\ncommon, and that they may have the enjoyment of thy benefits bestowed\r\nupon them.\"\r\n\r\n4. When Solomon had said this, and had cast himself upon the ground, and\r\nworshipped a long time, he rose up, and brought sacrifices to the altar;\r\nand when he had filled it with unblemished victims, he most evidently\r\ndiscovered that God had with pleasure accepted of all that he had\r\nsacrificed to him, for there came a fire running out of the air, and\r\nrushed with violence upon the altar, in the sight of all, and caught\r\nhold of and consumed the sacrifices. Now when this Divine appearance was\r\nseen, the people supposed it to be a demonstration of God's abode in the\r\ntemple, and were pleased with it, and fell down upon the ground and\r\nworshipped. Upon which the king began to bless God, and exhorted the\r\nmultitude to do the same, as now having sufficient indications of God's\r\nfavorable disposition to them; and to pray that they might always have\r\nthe like indications from him, and that he would preserve in them a mind\r\npure from all wickedness, in righteousness and religious worship, and\r\nthat they might continue in the observation of those precepts which God\r\nhad given them by Moses, because by that means the Hebrew nation would\r\nbe happy, and indeed the most blessed of all nations among all mankind.\r\nHe exhorted them also to be mindful, that by what methods they had\r\nattained their present good things, by the same they must preserve them\r\nsure to themselves, and make them greater and more than they were at\r\npresent; for that it was not sufficient for them to suppose they had\r\nreceived them on account of their piety and righteousness, but that they\r\nhad no other way of preserving them for the time to come; for that it is\r\nnot so great a thing for men to acquire somewhat which they want, as to\r\npreserve what they have acquired, and to be guilty of no sin whereby it\r\nmay be hurt.\r\n\r\n5. So when the king had spoken thus to the multitude, he dissolved the\r\ncongregation, but not till he had completed his oblations, both for\r\nhimself and for the Hebrews, insomuch that he sacrificed twenty and two\r\nthousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep; for then it was\r\nthat the temple did first of all taste of the victims, and all the\r\nHebrews, with their wives and children, feasted therein: nay, besides\r\nthis, the king then observed splendidly and magnificently the feast\r\nwhich is called the Feast of Tabernacles, before the temple, for twice\r\nseven days; and he then feasted together with all the people.\r\n\r\n6. When all these solemnities were abundantly satisfied, and nothing was\r\nomitted that concerned the Divine worship, the king dismissed them; and\r\nthey every one went to their own homes, giving thanks to the king for\r\nthe care he had taken of them, and the works he had done for them; and\r\npraying to God to preserve Solomon to be their king for a long time.\r\nThey also took their journey home with rejoicing, and making merry, and\r\nsinging hymns to God. And indeed the pleasure they enjoyed took away the\r\nsense of the pains they all underwent in their journey home. So when\r\nthey had brought the ark into the temple, and had seen its greatness,\r\nand how fine it was, and had been partakers of the many sacrifices that\r\nhad been offered, and of the festivals that had been solemnized, they\r\nevery one returned to their own cities. But a dream that appeared to the\r\nking in his sleep informed him that God had heard his prayers; and that\r\nhe would not only preserve the temple, but would always abide in it;\r\nthat is, in case his posterity and the whole multitude would be\r\nrighteous. And for himself, it said, that if he continued according to\r\nthe admonitions of his father, he would advance him to an immense degree\r\nof dignity and happiness, and that then his posterity should be kings of\r\nthat country, of the tribe of Judah, for ever; but that still, if he\r\nshould be found a betrayer of the ordinances of the law, and forget\r\nthem, and turn away to the worship of strange gods, he would cut him off\r\nby the roots, and would neither suffer any remainder of his family to\r\ncontinue, nor would overlook the people of Israel, or preserve them any\r\nlonger from afflictions, but would utterly destroy them with ten\r\nthousand wars and misfortunes; would cast them out of the land which he\r\nhad given their fathers, and make them sojourners in strange lands; and\r\ndeliver that temple which was now built to be burnt and spoiled by their\r\nenemies, and that city to be utterly overthrown by the hands of their\r\nenemies; and make their miseries deserve to be a proverb, and such as\r\nshould very hardly be credited for their stupendous magnitude, till\r\ntheir neighbors, when they should hear of them, should wonder at their\r\ncalamities, and very earnestly inquire for the occasion, why the\r\nHebrews, who had been so far advanced by God to such glory and wealth,\r\nshould be then so hated by him? and that the answer that should be made\r\nby the remainder of the people should be, by confessing their sins, and\r\ntheir transgression of the laws of their country. Accordingly we have it\r\ntransmitted to us in writing, that thus did God speak to Solomon in his\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How Solomon Built Himself A Royal Palace, Very Costly And\r\nSplendid; And How He Solved The Riddles Which Were Sent Him By Hiram.\r\n\r\n1. After the building of the temple, which, as we have before said, was\r\nfinished in seven years, the king laid the foundation of his palace,\r\nwhich he did not finish under thirteen years, for he was not equally\r\nzealous in the building of this palace as he had been about the temple;\r\nfor as to that, though it was a great work, and required wonderful and\r\nsurprising application, yet God, for whom it was made, so far co-\r\noperated therewith, that it was finished in the forementioned number of\r\nyears: but the palace, which was a building much inferior in dignity to\r\nthe temple, both on account that its materials had not been so long\r\nbeforehand gotten ready, nor had been so zealously prepared, and on\r\naccount that this was only a habitation for kings, and not for God, it\r\nwas longer in finishing. However, this building was raised so\r\nmagnificently, as suited the happy state of the Hebrews, and of the king\r\nthereof. But it is necessary that I describe the entire structure and\r\ndisposition of the parts, that so those that light upon this book may\r\nthereby make a conjecture, and, as it were, have a prospect of its\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\n2. This house was a large and curious building, and was supported by\r\nmany pillars, which Solomon built to contain a multitnde for hearing\r\ncauses, and taking cognizance of suits. It was sufficiently capacious to\r\ncontain a great body of men, who would come together to have their\r\ncauses determined. It was a hundred cubits long, and fifty broad, and\r\nthirty high, supported by quadrangular pillars, which were all of cedar;\r\nbut its roof was according to the Corinthian order, 14 with folding\r\ndoors, and their adjoining pillars of equal magnitude, each fluted with\r\nthree cavities; which building as at once firm, and very ornamental.\r\nThere was also another house so ordered, that its entire breadth was\r\nplaced in the middle; it was quadrangular, and its breadth was thirty\r\ncubits, having a temple over against it, raised upon massy pillars; in\r\nwhich temple there was a large and very glorious room, wherein the king\r\nsat in judgment. To this was joined another house that was built for his\r\nqueen. There were other smaller edifices for diet, and for sleep, after\r\npublic matters were over; and these were all floored with boards of\r\ncedar. Some of these Solomon built with stones of ten cubits, and\r\nwainscoted the walls with other stones that were sawed, and were of\r\ngreat value, such as are dug out of the earth for the ornaments of\r\ntemples, and to make fine prospects in royal palaces, and which make the\r\nmines whence they are dug famous. Now the contexture of the curious\r\nworkmanship of these stones was in three rows, but the fourth row would\r\nmake one admire its sculptures, whereby were represented trees, and all\r\nsorts of plants; with the shades that arose from their branches, and\r\nleaves that hung down from them. Those trees and plants covered the\r\nstone that was beneath them, and their leaves were wrought so prodigious\r\nthin and subtile, that you would think they were in motion; but the\r\nother part up to the roof, was plastered over, and, as it were,\r\nembroidered with colors and pictures. He, moreover, built other edifices\r\nfor pleasure; as also very long cloisters, and those situate in an\r\nagreeable place of the palace; and among them a most glorious dining\r\nroom, for feastings and compotations, and full of gold, and such other\r\nfurniture as so fine a room ought to have for the conveniency of the\r\nguests, and where all the vessels were made of gold. Now it is very hard\r\nto reckon up the magnitude and the variety of the royal apartments; how\r\nmany rooms there were of the largest sort, how many of a bigness\r\ninferior to those, and how many that were subterraneous and invisible;\r\nthe curiosity of those that enjoyed the fresh air; and the groves for\r\nthe most delightful prospect, for the avoiding the heat, and covering of\r\ntheir bodies. And, to say all in brief, Solomon made the whole building\r\nentirely of white stone, and cedar wood, and gold, and silver. He also\r\nadorned the roofs and walls with stones set in gold, and beautified them\r\nthereby in the same manner as he had beautified the temple of God with\r\nthe like stones. He also made himself a throne of prodigious bigness, of\r\nivory, constructed as a seat of justice, and having six steps to it; on\r\nevery one of which stood, on each end of the step two lions, two other\r\nlions standing above also; but at the sitting place of the throne hands\r\ncame out and received the king; and when he sat backward, he rested on\r\nhalf a bullock, that looked towards his back; but still all was fastened\r\ntogether with gold.\r\n\r\n3. When Solomon had completed all this in twenty years' time, because\r\nHiram king of Tyre had contributed a great deal of gold, and more silver\r\nto these buildings, as also cedar wood and pine wood, he also rewarded\r\nHiram with rich presents; corn he sent him also year by year, and wine\r\nand oil, which were the principal things that he stood in need of,\r\nbecause he inhabited an island, as we have already said. And besides\r\nthese, he granted him certain cities of Galilee, twenty in number, that\r\nlay not far from Tyre; which, when Hiram went to, and viewed, and did\r\nnot like the gift, he sent word to Solomon that he did not want such\r\ncities as they were; and after that time these cities were called the\r\nland of Cabul; which name, if it be interpreted according to the\r\nlanguage of the Phoenicians, denotes what does not please. Moreover, the\r\nking of Tyre sent sophisms and enigmatical sayings to Solomon, and\r\ndesired he would solve them, and free them from the ambiguity that was\r\nin them. Now so sagacious and understanding was Solomon, that none of\r\nthese problems were too hard for him; but he conquered them all by his\r\nreasonings, and discovered their hidden meaning, and brought it to\r\nlight. Menander also, one who translated the Tyrian archives out of the\r\ndialect of the Phoenicians into the Greek language, makes mention of\r\nthese two kings, where he says thus: \"When Abibalus was dead, his son\r\nHiram received the kingdom from him, who, when he had lived fifty-three\r\nyears, reigned thirty-four. He raised a bank in the large place, and\r\ndedicated the golden pillar which is in Jupiter's temple. He also went\r\nand cut down materials of timber out of the mountain called Libanus, for\r\nthe roof of temples; and when he had pulled down the ancient temples, he\r\nboth built the temple of Hercules and that of Astarte; and he first set\r\nup the temple of Hercules in the month Peritius; he also made an\r\nexpedition against the Euchii, or Titii, who did not pay their tribute,\r\nand when he had subdued them to himself he returned. Under this king\r\nthere was Abdemon, a very youth in age, who always conquered the\r\ndifficult problems which Solomon, king of Jerusalem, commanded him to\r\nexplain. Dius also makes mention of him, where he says thus: 'When\r\nAbibalus was dead, his son Hiram reigned. He raised the eastern parts of\r\nthe city higher, and made the city itself larger. He also joined the\r\ntemple of Jupiter, which before stood by itself, to the city, by raising\r\na bank in the middle between them; and he adorned it with donations of\r\ngold. Moreover, he went up to Mount Libanus, and cut down materials of\r\nwood for the building of the temples.' He says also, that Solomon, who\r\nwas then king of Jerusalem, sent riddles to Hiram, and desired to\r\nreceive the like from him, but that he who could not solve them should\r\npay money to them that did solve them, and that Hiram accepted the\r\nconditions; and when he was not able to solve the riddles proposed by\r\nSolomon, he paid a great deal of money for his fine; but that he\r\nafterward did solve the proposed riddles by means of Abdemon, a man of\r\nTyre; and that Hiram proposed other riddles, which, when Solomon could\r\nnot solve, he paid back a great deal of money to Hiram.\" This it is\r\nwhich Dius wrote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How Solomon Fortified The City Of Jerusalem, And Built Great\r\nCities; And How He Brought Some Of The Canaanites Into Subjection, And\r\nEntertained The Queen Of Egypt And Of Ethiopia.\r\n\r\n1. Now when the king saw that the walls of Jerusalem stood in need of\r\nbeing better secured, and made stronger, [for he thought the wails that\r\nencompassed Jerusalem ought to correspond to the dignity of the city,]\r\nhe both repaired them, and made them higher, with great towers upon\r\nthem; he also built cities which might be counted among the strongest,\r\nHazor and Megiddo, and the third Gezer, which had indeed belonged to the\r\nPhilistines; but Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had made an expedition\r\nagainst it, and besieged it, and taken it by force; and when he had\r\nslain all its inhabitants, he utterly overthrew it, and gave it as a\r\npresent to his daughter, who had been married to Solomon; for which\r\nreason the king rebuilt it, as a city that was naturally strong, and\r\nmight be useful in wars, and the mutations of affairs that sometimes\r\nhappen. Moreover, he built two other cities not far from it, Beth-horon\r\nwas the name of one of them, and Baalath of the other. He also built\r\nother cities that lay conveniently for these, in order to the enjoyment\r\nof pleasures and delicacies in them, such as were naturally of a good\r\ntemperature of the air, and agreeable for fruits ripe in their proper\r\nseasons, and well watered with springs. Nay, Solomon went as far as the\r\ndesert above Syria, and possessed himself of it, and built there a very\r\ngreat city, which was distant two days' journey from Upper Syria, and\r\none day's journey from Euphrates, and six long days' journey from\r\nBabylon the Great. Now the reason why this city lay so remote from the\r\nparts of Syria that are inhabited is this, that below there is no water\r\nto be had, and that it is in that place only that there are springs and\r\npits of water. When he had therefore built this city, and encompassed it\r\nwith very strong walls, he gave it the name of Tadmor, and that is the\r\nname it is still called by at this day among the Syrians, but the Greeks\r\nname it Palmyra.\r\n\r\n2. Now Solomon the king was at this time engaged in building these\r\ncities. But if any inquire why all the kings of Egypt from Menes, who\r\nbuilt Memphis, and was many years earlier than our forefather Abraham,\r\nuntil Solomon, where the interval was more than one thousand three\r\nhundred years, were called Pharaohs, and took it from one Pharaoh that\r\nlived after the kings of that interval, I think it necessary to inform\r\nthem of it, and this in order to cure their ignorance, and to make the\r\noccasion of that name manifest. Pharaoh, in the Egyptian tongue,\r\nsignifies a king 15 but I suppose they made use of other names from\r\ntheir childhood; but when they were made kings, they changed them into\r\nthe name which in their own tongue denoted their authority; for thus it\r\nwas also that the kings of Alexandria, who were called formerly by other\r\nnames, when they took the kingdom, were named Ptolemies, from their\r\nfirst king. The Roman emperors also were from their nativity called by\r\nother names, but are styled Cæsars, their empire and their dignity\r\nimposing that name upon them, and not suffering them to continue in\r\nthose names which their fathers gave them. I suppose also that Herodotus\r\nof Halicarnassus, when he said there were three hundred and thirty kings\r\nof Egypt after Menes, who built Memphis, did therefore not tell us their\r\nnames, because they were in common called Pharaohs; for when after their\r\ndeath there was a queen reigned, he calls her by her name Nicaule, as\r\nthereby declaring, that while the kings were of the male line, and so\r\nadmitted of the same nature, while a woman did not admit the same, he\r\ndid therefore set down that her name, which she could not naturally\r\nhave. As for myself, I have discovered from our own books, that after\r\nPharaoh, the father-in-law of Solomon, no other king of Egypt did any\r\nlonger use that name; and that it was after that time when the forenamed\r\nqueen of Egypt and Ethiopia came to Solomon, concerning whom we shall\r\ninform the reader presently; but I have now made mention of these\r\nthings, that I may prove that our books and those of the Egyptians agree\r\ntogether in many things.\r\n\r\n3. But king Solomon subdued to himself the remnant of the Canaanites\r\nthat had not before submitted to him; those I mean that dwelt in Mount\r\nLebanon, and as far as the city Hamath; and ordered them to pay tribute.\r\nHe also chose out of them every year such as were to serve him in the\r\nmeanest offices, and to do his domestic works, and to follow husbandry;\r\nfor none of the Hebrews were servants [in such low employments]: nor was\r\nit reasonable, that when God had brought so many nations under their\r\npower, they should depress their own people to such mean offices of\r\nlife, rather than those nations; while all the Israelites were concerned\r\nin warlike affairs, and were in armor; and were set over the chariots\r\nand the horses, rather than leading the life of slaves. He appointed\r\nalso five hundred and fifty rulers over those Canaanites who were\r\nreduced to such domestic slavery, who received the entire care of them\r\nfrom the king, and instructed them in those labors and operations\r\nwherein he wanted their assistance.\r\n\r\n4. Moreover, the king built many ships in the Egyptian Bay of the Red\r\nSea, in a certain place called Ezion-geber: it is now called Berenice,\r\nand is not far from the city Eloth. This country belonged formerly to\r\nthe Jews, and became useful for shipping from the donations of Hiram\r\nking of Tyre; for he sent a sufficient number of men thither for pilots,\r\nand such as were skillful in navigation, to whom Solomon gave this\r\ncommand: That they should go along with his own stewards to the land\r\nthat was of old called Ophir, but now the Aurea Chersonesus, which\r\nbelongs to India, to fetch him gold. And when they had gathered four\r\nhundred talents together, they returned to the king again.\r\n\r\n5. There was then a woman queen of Egypt and Ethiopia; 16 she was\r\ninquisitive into philosophy, and one that on other accounts also was to\r\nbe admired. When this queen heard of the virtue and prudence of Solomon,\r\nshe had a great mind to see him; and the reports that went every day\r\nabroad induced her to come to him, she being desirous to be satisfied by\r\nher own experience, and not by a bare hearing; [for reports thus heard\r\nare likely enough to comply with a false opinion, while they wholly\r\ndepend on the credit of the relators;] so she resolved to come to him,\r\nand that especially in order to have a trial of his wisdom, while she\r\nproposed questions of very great difficulty, and entreated that he would\r\nsolve their hidden meaning. Accordingly she came to Jerusalem with great\r\nsplendor and rich furniture; for she brought with her camels laden with\r\ngold, with several sorts of sweet spices, and with precious stones. Now,\r\nupon the king's kind reception of her, he both showed a great desire to\r\nplease her, and easily comprehending in his mind the meaning of the\r\ncurious questions she propounded to him, he resolved them sooner than\r\nany body could have expected. So she was amazed at the wisdom of\r\nSolomon, and discovered that it was more excellent upon trial than what\r\nshe had heard by report beforehand; and especially she was surprised at\r\nthe fineness and largeness of his royal palace, and not less so at the\r\ngood order of the apartments, for she observed that the king had therein\r\nshown great wisdom; but she was beyond measure astonished at the house\r\nwhich was called the Forest of Lebanon, as also at the magnificence of\r\nhis daily table, and the circumstances of its preparation and\r\nministration, with the apparel of his servants that waited, and the\r\nskillful and decent management of their attendance: nor was she less\r\naffected with those daily sacrifices which were offered to God, and the\r\ncareful management which the priests and Levites used about them. When\r\nshe saw this done every day, she was in the greatest admiration\r\nimaginable, insomuch that she was not able to contain the surprise she\r\nwas in, but openly confessed how wonderfully she was affected; for she\r\nproceeded to discourse with the king, and thereby owned that she was\r\novercome with admiration at the things before related; and said, \"All\r\nthings indeed, O king, that came to our knowledge by report, came with\r\nuncertainty as to our belief of them; but as to those good things that\r\nto thee appertain, both such as thou thyself possessest, I mean wisdom\r\nand prudence, and the happiness thou hast from thy kingdom, certainly\r\nthe same that came to us was no falsity; it was not only a true report,\r\nbut it related thy happiness after a much lower manner than I now see it\r\nto be before my eyes. For as for the report, it only attempted to\r\npersuade our hearing, but did not so make known the dignity of the\r\nthings themselves as does the sight of them, and being present among\r\nthem. I indeed, who did not believe what was reported, by reason of the\r\nmultitude and grandeur of the things I inquired about, do see them to be\r\nmuch more numerous than they were reported to be. Accordingly I esteem\r\nthe Hebrew people, as well as thy servants and friends, to be happy, who\r\nenjoy thy presence and hear thy wisdom every day continually. One would\r\ntherefore bless God, who hath so loved this country, and those that\r\ninhabit therein, as to make thee king over them.\"\r\n\r\n6. Now when the queen had thus demonstrated in words how deeply the king\r\nhad affected her, her disposition was known by certain presents, for she\r\ngave him twenty talents of gold, and an immense quantity of spices and\r\nprecious stones. (They say also that we possess the root of that balsam\r\nwhich our country still bears by this woman's gift.) 17 Solomon also\r\nrepaid her with many good things, and principally by bestowing upon her\r\nwhat she chose of her own inclination, for there was nothing that she\r\ndesired which he denied her; and as he was very generous and liberal in\r\nhis own temper, so did he show the greatness of his soul in bestowing on\r\nher what she herself desired of him. So when this queen of Ethiopia had\r\nobtained what we have already given an account of, and had again\r\ncommunicated to the king what she brought with her, she returned to her\r\nown kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How Solomon Grew Rich, And Fell Desperately In Love With\r\nWomen And How God, Being Incensed At It, Raised Up Ader And Jeroboam\r\nAgainst Him. Concerning The Death Of Solomon.\r\n\r\n1. About the same time there were brought to the king from the Aurea\r\nChersonesus, a country so called, precious stones, and pine trees, and\r\nthese trees he made use of for supporting the temple and the palace, as\r\nalso for the materials of musical instruments, the harps and the\r\npsalteries, that the Levites might make use of them in their hymns to\r\nGod. The wood which was brought to him at this time was larger and finer\r\nthan any that had ever been brought before; but let no one imagine that\r\nthese pine trees were like those which are now so named, and which take\r\nthat their denomination from the merchants, who so call them, that they\r\nmay procure them to be admired by those that purchase them; for those we\r\nspeak of were to the sight like the wood of the fig tree, but were\r\nwhiter, and more shining. Now we have said thus much, that nobody may be\r\nignorant of the difference between these sorts of wood, nor unacquainted\r\nwith the nature of the genuine pine tree; and we thought it both a\r\nseasonable and humane thing, when we mentioned it, and the uses the king\r\nmade of it, to explain this difference so far as we have done.\r\n\r\n2. Now the weight of gold that was brought him was six hundred and\r\nsixty-six talents, not including in that sum what was brought by the\r\nmerchants, nor what the toparchs and kings of Arabia gave him in\r\npresents. He also cast two hundred targets of gold, each of them\r\nweighing six hundred shekels. He also made three hundred shields, every\r\none weighing three pounds of gold, and he had them carried and put into\r\nthat house which was called The Forest of Lebanon. He also made cups of\r\ngold, and of [precious] stones, for the entertainment of his guests, and\r\nhad them adorned in the most artificial manner; and he contrived that\r\nall his other furniture of vessels should be of gold, for there was\r\nnothing then to be sold or bought for silver; for the king had many\r\nships which lay upon the sea of Tarsus, these he commanded to carry out\r\nall sorts of merchandise unto the remotest nations, by the sale of which\r\nsilver and gold were brought to the king, and a great quantity of ivory,\r\nand Ethiopians, and apes; and they finished their voyage, going and\r\nreturning, in three years' time.\r\n\r\n3. Accordingly there went a great fame all around the neighboring\r\ncountries, which proclaimed the virtue and wisdom of Solomon, insomuch\r\nthat all the kings every where were desirous to see him, as not giving\r\ncredit to what was reported, on account of its being almost incredible:\r\nthey also demonstrated the regard they had for him by the presents they\r\nmade him; for they sent him vessels of gold, and silver, and purple\r\ngarments, and many sorts of spices, and horses, and chariots, and as\r\nmany mules for his carriages as they could find proper to please the\r\nking's eyes, by their strength and beauty. This addition that he made to\r\nthose chariots and horses which he had before from those that were sent\r\nhim, augmented the number of his chariots by above four hundred, for he\r\nhad a thousand before, and augmented the number of his horses by two\r\nthousand, for he had twenty thousand before. These horses also were so\r\nmuch exercised, in order to their making a fine appearance, and running\r\nswiftly, that no others could, upon the comparison, appear either finer\r\nor swifter; but they were at once the most beautiful of all others, and\r\ntheir swiftness was incomparable also. Their riders also were a further\r\nornament to them, being, in the first place, young men in the most\r\ndelightful flower of their age, and being eminent for their largeness,\r\nand far taller than other men. They had also very long heads of hair\r\nhanging down, and were clothed in garments of Tyrian purple. They had\r\nalso dust of gold every day sprinkled on their hair, so that their heads\r\nsparkled with the reflection of the sun-beams from the gold. The king\r\nhimself rode upon a chariot in the midst of these men, who were still in\r\narmor, and had their bows fitted to them. He had on a white garment, and\r\nused to take his progress out of the city in the morning. There was a\r\ncertain place about fifty furlongs distant from Jerusalem, which is\r\ncalled Etham, very pleasant it is in fine gardens, and abounding in\r\nrivulets of water; 18 thither did he use to go out in the morning,\r\nsitting on high [in his chariot.]\r\n\r\n4. Now Solomon had a divine sagacity in all things, and was very\r\ndiligent and studious to have things done after an elegant manner; so he\r\ndid not neglect the care of the ways, but he laid a causeway of black\r\nstone along the roads that led to Jerusalem, which was the royal city,\r\nboth to render them easy for travelers, and to manifest the grandeur of\r\nhis riches and government. He also parted his chariots, and set them in\r\na regular order, that a certain number of them should be in every city,\r\nstill keeping a few about him; and those cities he called the cities of\r\nhis chariots. And the king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as\r\nstones in the street; and so multiplied cedar trees in the plains of\r\nJudea, which did not grow there before, that they were like the\r\nmultitude of common sycamore trees. He also ordained the Egyptian\r\nmerchants that brought him their merchandise to sell him a chariot, with\r\na pair of horses, for six hundred drachmae of silver, and he sent them\r\nto the kings of Syria, and to those kings that were beyond Euphrates.\r\n\r\n5. But although Solomon was become the most glorious of kings, and the\r\nbest beloved by God, and had exceeded in wisdom and riches those that\r\nhad been rulers of the Hebrews before him, yet did not he persevere in\r\nthis happy state till he died. Nay, he forsook the observation of the\r\nlaws of his fathers, and came to an end no way suitable to our foregoing\r\nhistory of him. He grew mad in his love of women, and laid no restraint\r\non himself in his lusts; nor was he satisfied with the women of his\r\ncountry alone, but he married many wives out of foreign nations;\r\nSidontans, and Tyrians, and Ammonites, and Edomites; and he transgressed\r\nthe laws of Moses, which forbade Jews to marry any but those that were\r\nof their own people. He also began to worship their gods, which he did\r\nin order to the gratification of his wives, and out of his affection for\r\nthem. This very thing our legislator suspected, and so admonished us\r\nbeforehand, that we should not marry women of other countries, lest we\r\nshould be entangled with foreign customs, and apostatize from our own;\r\nlest we should leave off to honor our own God, and should worship their\r\ngods. But Solomon was Gllen headlong into unreasonable pleasures, and\r\nregarded not those admonitions; for when he had married seven hundred\r\nwives, 19 the daughters of princes and of eminent persons, and three\r\nhundred concubines, and those besides the king of Egypt's daughter, he\r\nsoon was governed by them, till he came to imitate their practices. He\r\nwas forced to give them this demonstration of his kindness and affection\r\nto them, to live according to the laws of their countries. And as he\r\ngrew into years, and his reason became weaker by length of time, it was\r\nnot sufficient to recall to his mind the institutions of his own\r\ncountry; so he still more and more contemned his own God, and continued\r\nto regard the gods that his marriages had introduced nay, before this\r\nhappened, he sinned, and fell into an error about the observation of the\r\nlaws, when he made the images of brazen oxen that supported the brazen\r\nsea, 20 and the images of lions about his own throne; for these he made,\r\nalthough it was not agreeable to piety so to do; and this he did,\r\nnotwithstanding that he had his father as a most excellent and domestic\r\npattern of virtue, and knew what a glorious character he had left behind\r\nhim, because of his piety towards God. Nor did he imitate David,\r\nalthough God had twice appeared to him in his sleep, and exhorted him to\r\nimitate his father. So he died ingloriously. There came therefore a\r\nprophet to him, who was sent by God, and told him that his wicked\r\nactions were not concealed from God; and threatened him that he should\r\nnot long rejoice in what he had done; that, indeed, the kingdom should\r\nnot be taken from him while he was alive, because God had promised to\r\nhis father David that he would make him his successor, but that he would\r\ntake care that this should befall his son when he was dead; not that he\r\nwould withdraw all the people from him, but that he would give ten\r\ntribes to a servant of his, and leave only two tribes to David's\r\ngrandson for his sake, because he loved God, and for the sake of the\r\ncity of Jerusalem, wherein he should have a temple.\r\n\r\n6. When Solomon heard this he was grieved, and greatly confounded, upon\r\nthis change of almost all that happiness which had made him to be\r\nadmired, into so bad a state; nor had there much time passed after the\r\nprophet had foretold what was coming before God raised up an enemy\r\nagainst him, whose name was Ader, who took the following occasion of his\r\nenmity to him. He was a child of the stock of the Edomites, and of the\r\nblood royal; and when Joab, the captain of David's host, laid waste the\r\nland of Edom, and destroyed all that were men grown, and able to bear\r\narms, for six months' time, this Hadad fled away, and came to Pharaoh\r\nthe king of Egypt, who received him kindly, and assigned him a house to\r\ndwell in, and a country to supply him with food; and when he was grown\r\nup he loved him exceedingly, insomuch that he gave him his wife's\r\nsister, whose name was Tahpenes, to wife, by whom he had a son; who was\r\nbrought up with the king's children. When Hadad heard in Egypt that both\r\nDavid and Joab were dead, he came to Pharaoh, and desired that he would\r\npermit him to go to his own country; upon which the king asked what it\r\nwas that he wanted, and what hardship he had met with, that he was so\r\ndesirous to leave him. And when he was often troublesome to him, and\r\nentreated him to dismiss him, he did not then do it; but at the time\r\nwhen Solomon's affairs began to grow worse, on account of his\r\nforementioned transgressions 21 and God's anger against him for the\r\nsame, Hadad, by Pharaoh's permission, came to Edom; and when he was not\r\nable to make the people forsake Solomon, for it was kept under by many\r\ngarrisons, and an innovation was not to be made with safety, he removed\r\nthence, and came into Syria; there he lighted upon one Rezon, who had\r\nrun away from Hadadezer, king of Zobah, his master, and was become a\r\nrobber in that country, and joined friendship with him, who had already\r\na band of robbers about him. So he went up, and seized upon that part of\r\nSyria, and was made king thereof. He also made incursions into the land\r\nof Israel, and did it no small mischief, and spoiled it, and that in the\r\nlifetime of Solomon. And this was the calamity which the Hebrews\r\nsuffered by Hadad.\r\n\r\n7. There was also one of Solomon's own nation that made an attempt\r\nagainst him, Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had an expectation of\r\nrising, from a prophecy that had been made to him long before. He was\r\nleft a child by his father, and brought up by his mother; and when\r\nSolomon saw that he was of an active and bold disposition, he made him\r\nthe curator of the walls which he built round about Jerusalem; and he\r\ntook such care of those works, that the king approved of his behavior,\r\nand gave him, as a reward for the same, the charge of the tribe of\r\nJoseph. And when about that time Jeroboam was once going out of\r\nJerusalem, a prophet of the city Shilo, whose name was Ahijah, met him\r\nand saluted him; and when he had taken him a little aside to a place out\r\nof the way, where there was not one other person present, he rent the\r\ngarment he had on into twelve pieces, and bid Jeroboam take ten of them;\r\nand told him beforehand, that \"this is the will of God; he will part the\r\ndominion of Solomon, and give one tribe, with that which is next it, to\r\nhis son, because of the promise made to David for his succession, and\r\nwill have ten tribes to thee, because Solomon hath sinned against him,\r\nand delivered up himself to women, and to their gods. Seeing therefore\r\nthou knowest the cause for which God hath changed his mind, and is\r\nalienated from Solomon, be thou....\"\r\n\r\n8. So Jeroboam was elevated by these words of the prophet; and being a\r\nyoung man, 22 of a warm temper, and ambitious of greatness, he could not\r\nbe quiet; and when he had so great a charge in the government, and\r\ncalled to mind what had been revealed to him by Ahijah, he endeavored to\r\npersuade the people to forsake Solomon, to make a disturbance, and to\r\nbring the government over to himself. But when Solomon understood his\r\nintention and treachery, he sought to catch him and kill him; but\r\nJeroboam was informed of it beforehand, and fled to Shishak, the king of\r\nEgypt, and there abode till the death of Solomon; by which means he\r\ngained these two advantages to suffer no harm from Solomon, and to be\r\npreserved for the kingdom. So Solomon died when he was already an old\r\nman, having reigned eighty years, and lived ninety-four. He was buried\r\nin Jerusalem, having been superior to all other kings in happiness, and\r\nriches, and wisdom, excepting that when he was growing into years he was\r\ndeluded by women, and transgressed the law; concerning which\r\ntransgressions, and the miseries which befell the Hebrews thereby, I\r\nthink proper to discourse at another opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. How, Upon The Death Of Solomon The People Forsook His Son\r\nRehoboam, And Ordained Jeroboam King Over The Ten Tribes.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Solomon was dead, and his son Rehoboam [who was born of an\r\nAmmonite wife; whose name was Naamah] had succeeded him in the kingdom,\r\nthe rulers of the multitude sent immediately into Egypt, and called back\r\nJeroboam; and when he was come to them, to the city Shethem, Rehoboam\r\ncame to it also, for he had resolved to declare himself king to the\r\nIsraelites while they were there gathered together. So the rulers of the\r\npeople, as well as Jeroboam, came to him, and besought him, and said\r\nthat he ought to relax, and to be gentler than his father, in the\r\nservitude he had imposed on them, because they had borne a heavy yoke,\r\nand that then they should be better affected to him, and be well\r\ncontented to serve him under his moderate government, and should do it\r\nmore out of love than fear. But Rehoboam told them they should come to\r\nhim again in three days' time, when he would give an answer to their\r\nrequest. This delay gave occasion to a present suspicion, since he had\r\nnot given them a favorable answer to their mind immediately; for they\r\nthought that he should have given them a humane answer off-hand,\r\nespecially since he was but young. However, they thought that this\r\nconsultation about it, and that he did not presently give them a denial,\r\nafforded them some good hope of success.\r\n\r\n2. Rehoboam now called his father's friends, and advised with them what\r\nsort of answer he ought to give to the multitude; upon which they gave\r\nhim the advice which became friends, and those that knew the temper of\r\nsuch a multitude. They advised him to speak in a way more popular than\r\nsuited the grandeur of a king, because he would thereby oblige them to\r\nsubmit to him with goodwill, it being most agreeable to subjects that\r\ntheir kings should be almost upon the level with them. But Rehoboam\r\nrejected this so good, and in general so profitable, advice, [it was\r\nsuch, at least, at that time when he was to be made king,] God himself,\r\nI suppose, causing what was most advantageous to be condemned by him. So\r\nhe called for the young men who were brought up with him, and told them\r\nwhat advice the elders had given him, and bade them speak what they\r\nthought he ought to do. They advised him to give the following answer to\r\nthe people [for neither their youth nor God himself suffered them to\r\ndiscern what was best]: That his little finger should be thicker than\r\nhis father's loins; and if they had met with hard usage from his father,\r\nthey should experience much rougher treatment from him; and if his\r\nfather had chastised them with whips, they must expect that he would do\r\nit with scorpions. 23 The king was pleased with this advice, and thought\r\nit agreeable to the dignity of his government to give them such an\r\nanswer. Accordingly, when the multitude was come together to hear his\r\nanswer on the third day, all the people were in great expectation, and\r\nvery intent to hear what the king would say to them, and supposed they\r\nshould hear somewhat of a kind nature; but he passed by his friends, and\r\nanswered as the young men had given him counsel. Now this was done\r\naccording to the will of God, that what Ahijah had foretold might come\r\nto pass.\r\n\r\n3. By these words the people were struck as it were by an iron hammer,\r\nand were so grieved at the words, as if they had already felt the\r\neffects of them; and they had great indignation at the king; and all\r\ncried out aloud, and said, \"We will have no longer any relation to David\r\nor his posterity after this day.\" And they said further, \"We only leave\r\nto Rehoboam the temple which his father built;\" and they threatened to\r\nforsake him. Nay, they were so bitter, and retained their wrath so long,\r\nthat when he sent Adoram, which was over the tribute, that he might\r\npacify them, and render them milder, and persuade them to forgive him,\r\nif he had said any thing that was rash or grievous to them in his youth,\r\nthey would not hear it, but threw stones at him, and killed him. When\r\nRehoboam saw this, he thought himself aimed at by those stones with\r\nwhich they had killed his servant, and feared lest he should undergo the\r\nlast of punishments in earnest; so he got immediately into his chariot,\r\nand fled to Jerusalem, where the tribe of Judah and that of Benjamin\r\nordained him king; but the rest of the multitude forsook the sons of\r\nDavid from that day, and appointed Jeroboam to be the ruler of their\r\npublic affairs. Upon this Rehoboam, Solomon's son, assembled a great\r\ncongregation of those two tribes that submitted to him, and was ready to\r\ntake a hundred and eighty thousand chosen men out of the army, to make\r\nan expedition against Jeroboam and his people, that he might force them\r\nby war to be his servants; but he was forbidden of God by the prophet\r\n[Shemaiah] to go to war, for that it was not just that brethren of the\r\nsame country should fight one against another. He also said that this\r\ndefection of the multitude was according to the purpose of God. So he\r\ndid not proceed in this expedition. And now I will relate first the\r\nactions of Jeroboam the king of Israel, after which we will relate what\r\nare therewith connected, the actions of Rehoboam, the king of the two\r\ntribes; by this means we shall preserve the good order of the history\r\nentire.\r\n\r\n4. When therefore Jeroboam had built him a palace in the city Shechem,\r\nhe dwelt there. He also built him another at Penuel, a city so called.\r\nAnd now the feast of tabernacles was approaching in a little time,\r\nJeroboam considered, that if he should permit the multitude to go to\r\nworship God at Jerusalem, and there to celebrate the festival, they\r\nwould probably repent of what they had done, and be enticed by the\r\ntemple, and by the worship of God there performed, and would leave him,\r\nand return to their first kings; and if so, he should run the risk of\r\nlosing his own life; so he invented this contrivance; He made two golden\r\nheifers, and built two little temples for them, the one in the city\r\nBethel, and the other in Dan, which last was at the fountains of the\r\nLesser Jordan 24 and he put the heifers into both the little temples, in\r\nthe forementioned cities. And when he had called those ten tribes\r\ntogether over whom he ruled, he made a speech to the people in these\r\nwords: \"I suppose, my countrymen, that you know this, that every place\r\nhath God in it; nor is there any one determinate place in which he is,\r\nbut he every where hears and sees those that worship him; on which\r\naccount I do not think it right for you to go so long a journey to\r\nJerusalem, which is an enemy's city, to worship him. It was a man that\r\nbuilt the temple: I have also made two golden heifers, dedicated to the\r\nsame God; and the one of them I have consecrated in the city Bethel, and\r\nthe other in Dan, to the end that those of you that dwell nearest those\r\ncities may go to them, and worship God there; and I will ordain for you\r\ncertain priests and Levites from among yourselves, that you may have no\r\nwant of the tribe of Levi, or of the sons of Aaron; but let him that is\r\ndesirous among you of being a priest, bring to God a bullock and a ram,\r\nwhich they say Aaron the first priest brought also.\" When Jeroboam had\r\nsaid this, he deluded the people, and made them to revolt from the\r\nworship of their forefathers, and to transgress their laws. This was the\r\nbeginning of miseries to the Hebrews, and the cause why they were\r\novercome in war by foreigners, and so fell into captivity. But we shall\r\nrelate those things in their proper places hereafter.\r\n\r\n5. When the feast [of tabernacles] was just approaching, Jeroboam was\r\ndesirous to celebrate it himself in Bethel, as did the two tribes\r\ncelebrate it in Jerusalem. Accordingly he built an altar before the\r\nheifer, and undertook to be high priest himself. So he went up to the\r\naltar, with his own priests about him; but when he was going to offer\r\nthe sacrifices and the burnt-offerings, in the sight of all the people,\r\na prophet, whose name was Jadon, was sent by God, and came to him from\r\nJerusalem, who stood in the midst of the multitude, and in the 'hearing\r\nof' the king, and directing his discourse to the altar, said thus: \"God\r\nforetells that there shall be a certain man of the family of David,\r\nJosiah by name, who shall slay upon thee those false priests that shall\r\nlive at that time, and upon thee shall burn the bones of those deceivers\r\nof the people, those impostors' and wicked wretches. However, that this\r\npeople may believe that these things shall so come to pass, I foretell a\r\nsign to them that shall also come to pass. This altar shall be broken to\r\npieces immediately, and all the fat of the sacrifices that is upon it\r\nshall be poured upon the ground.\" When the prophet had said this,\r\nJeroboam fell into a passion, and stretched out his hand, and bid them\r\nlay hold of him; but that hand which he stretched out was enfeebled, and\r\nhe was not able to pull it in again to him, for it was become withered,\r\nand hung down, as if it were a dead hand. The altar also was broken to\r\npieces, and all that was upon it was poured out, as the prophet had\r\nforetold should come to pass. So the king understood that he was a man\r\nof veracity, and had a Divine foreknowledge; and entreated him to pray\r\nto God that he would restore his right hand. Accordingly the prophet did\r\npray to God to grant him that request. So the king, having his hand\r\nrecovered to its natural state, rejoiced at it, and invited the prophet\r\nto sup with him; but Jadon said that he could not endure to come into\r\nhis house, nor to taste of bread or water in this city, for that was a\r\nthing God had forbidden him to do; as also to go back by the same way\r\nwhich he came, but he said he was to return by another way. So the king\r\nwondered at the abstinence of the man, but was himself in fear, as\r\nsuspecting a change of his affairs for the worse, from what had been\r\nsaid to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. How Jadon The Prophet Was Persuaded By Another Lying Prophet\r\nAnd Returned [To Bethel,] And Was Afterwards Slain By A Lion. As Also\r\nWhat Words The Wicked Prophet Made Use Of To Persuade The King, And\r\nThereby Alienated His Mind From God.\r\n\r\n1. Now there was a certain wicked man in that city, who was a false\r\nprophet, whom Jeroboam had in great esteem, but was deceived by him and\r\nhis flattering words. This man was bedrid, by reason or the infirmities\r\nof old age: however, he was informed by his sons concerning the prophet\r\nthat was come from Jerusalem, and concerning the signs done by him; and\r\nhow, when Jeroboam's right hand had been enfeebled, at the prophet's\r\nprayer he had it revived again. Whereupon he was afraid that this\r\nstranger and prophet should be in better esteem with the king than\r\nhimself, and obtain greater honor from him: and he gave orders to his\r\nsons to saddle his ass presently, and make all ready that he might go\r\nout. Accordingly they made haste to do what they were commanded, and he\r\ngot upon the ass and followed after the prophet; and when he had\r\novertaken him, as he was resting himself under a very large oak tree\r\nthat was thick and shady, he at first saluted him, but presently he\r\ncomplained of him, because he had not come into his house, and partaken\r\nof his hospitality. And when the other said that God had forbidden him\r\nto taste of any one's provision in that city, he replied, that \"for\r\ncertain God had not forbidden that I should set food before thee, for I\r\nam a prophet as thou art, and worship God in the same manner that thou\r\ndost; and I am now come as sent by him, in order to bring thee into my\r\nhouse, and make thee my guest.\" Now Jadon gave credit to this lying\r\nprophet, and returned back with him. But when they were at dinner, and\r\nmerry together, God appeared to Jadon, and said that he should suffer\r\npunishment for transgressing his commands,—and he told him what that\r\npunishment should be for he said that he should meet with a lion as he\r\nwas going on his way, by which lion he should be torn in pieces, and be\r\ndeprived of burial in the sepulchers of his fathers; which things came\r\nto pass, as I suppose, according to the will of God, that so Jeroboam\r\nmight not give heed to the words of Jadon as of one that had been\r\nconvicted of lying. However, as Jadon was again going to Jerusalem, a\r\nlion assaulted him, and pulled him off the beast he rode on, and slew\r\nhim; yet did he not at all hurt the ass, but sat by him, and kept him,\r\nas also the prophet's body. This continued till some travelers that saw\r\nit came and told it in the city to the false prophet, who sent his sons,\r\nand brought the body unto the city, and made a funeral for him at great\r\nexpense. He also charged his sons to bury himself with him and said that\r\nall which he had foretold against that city, and the altar, and priests,\r\nand false prophets, would prove true; and that if he were buried with\r\nhim, he should receive no injurious treatment after his death, the bones\r\nnot being then to be distinguished asunder. But now, when he had\r\nperformed those funeral rites to the prophet, and had given that charge\r\nto his sons, as he was a wicked and an impious man, he goes to Jeroboam,\r\nand says to him, \"And wherefore is it now that thou art disturbed at the\r\nwords of this silly fellow?\" And when the king had related to him what\r\nhad happened about the altar, and about his own hand, and gave him the\r\nnames of divine man, and an excellent prophet, he endeavored by a wicked\r\ntrick to weaken that his opinion; and by using plausible words\r\nconcerning what had happened, he aimed to injure the truth that was in\r\nthem; for he attempted to persuade him that his hand was enfeebled by\r\nthe labor it had undergone in supporting the sacrifices, and that upon\r\nits resting awhile it returned to its former nature again; and that as\r\nto the altar, it was but new, and had borne abundance of sacrifices, and\r\nthose large ones too, and was accordingly broken to pieces, and fallen\r\ndown by the weight of what had been laid upon it. He also informed him\r\nof the death of him that had foretold those things, and how he perished;\r\n[whence he concluded that] he had not any thing in him of a prophet, nor\r\nspake any thing like one. When he had thus spoken, he persuaded the\r\nking, and entirely alienated his mind from God, and from doing works\r\nthat were righteous and holy, and encouraged him to go on in his impious\r\npractices 25 and accordingly he was to that degree injurious to God, and\r\nso great a transgressor, that he sought for nothing else every day but\r\nhow he might be guilty of some new instances of wickedness, and such as\r\nshould be more detestable than what he had been so insolent as to do\r\nbefore. And so much shall at present suffice to have said concerning\r\nJeroboam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. Concerning Rehoboam, And How God Inflicted Punishment Upon\r\nHim For His Impiety By Shishak [King Of Egypt].\r\n\r\n1. Now Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, who, as we said before, was king of\r\nthe two tribes, built strong and large cities, Bethlehem, and Etare, and\r\nTekoa, and Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam, and Ipan, and Maresha, and\r\nZiph, and Adorlam, and Lachlsh, and Azekah, and Zorah, and Aijalon, and\r\nHebron; these he built first of all in the tribe of Judah. He also built\r\nother large cities in the tribe of Benjamin, and walled them about, and\r\nput garrisons in them all, and captains, and a great deal of corn, and\r\nwine, and oil, and he furnished every one of them plentifully with other\r\nprovisions that were necessary for sustenance; moreover, he put therein\r\nshields and spears for many ten thousand men. The priests also that were\r\nin all Israel, and the Levites, and if there were any of the multitude\r\nthat were good and righteous men, they gathered themselves together to\r\nhim, having left their own cities, that they might worship God in\r\nJerusalem; for they were not willing to be forced to worship the heifers\r\nwhich Jeroboam had made; and they augmented the kingdom of Rehoboam for\r\nthree years. And after he had married a woman of his own kindred, and\r\nhad by her three children born to him, he married also another of his\r\nown kindred, who was daughter of Absalom by Tamar, whose name was\r\nMaachah, and by her he had a son, whom he named Abijah. He had moreover\r\nmany other children by other wives, but he loved Maachah above them all.\r\nNow he had eighteen legitimate wives, and thirty concubines; and he had\r\nborn to him twenty-eight sons and threescore daughters; but he appointed\r\nAbijah, whom he had by Maachah, to be his successor in the kingdom, and\r\nintrusted him already with the treasures and the strongest cities.\r\n\r\n2. Now I cannot but think that the greatness of a kingdom, and its\r\nchange into prosperity, often become the occasion of mischief and of\r\ntransgression to men; for when Rehoboam saw that his kingdom was so much\r\nincreased, he went out of the right way unto unrighteous and irreligious\r\npractices, and he despised the worship of God, till the people\r\nthemselves imitated his wicked actions: for so it usually happens, that\r\nthe manners of subjects are corrupted at the same time with those of\r\ntheir governors, which subjects then lay aside their own sober way of\r\nliving, as a reproof of their governors' intemperate courses, and follow\r\ntheir wickedness as if it were virtue; for it is not possible to show\r\nthat men approve of the actions of their kings, unless they do the same\r\nactions with them. Agreeable whereto it now happened to the subjects of\r\nRehoboam; for when he was grown impious, and a transgressor himself,\r\nthey endeavored not to offend him by resolving still to be righteous.\r\nBut God sent Shishak, king of Egypt, to punish them for their unjust\r\nbehavior towards him, concerning whom Herodotus was mistaken, and\r\napplied his actions to Sesostris; for this Shishak, 26 in the fifth year\r\nof the reign of Rehoboam, made an expedition [into Judea] with many ten\r\nthousand men; for he had one thousand two hundred chariots in number\r\nthat followed him, and threescore thousand horsemen, and four hundred\r\nthousand footmen. These he brought with him, and they were the greatest\r\npart of them Libyans and Ethiopians. Now therefore when he fell upon the\r\ncountry of the Hebrews, he took the strongest cities of Rehoboam's\r\nkingdom without fighting; and when he had put garrisons in them, he came\r\nlast of all to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n3. Now when Rehoboam, and the multitude with him, were shut up in\r\nJerusalem by the means of the army of Shishak, and when they besought\r\nGod to give them victory and deliverance, they could not persuade God to\r\nbe on their side. But Shemaiah the prophet told them, that God\r\nthreatened to forsake them, as they had themselves forsaken his worship.\r\nWhen they heard this, they were immediately in a consternation of mind;\r\nand seeing no way of deliverance, they all earnestly set themselves to\r\nconfess that God might justly overlook them, since they had been guilty\r\nof impiety towards him, and had let his laws lie in confusion. So when\r\nGod saw them in that disposition, and that they acknowledge their sins,\r\nhe told the prophet that he would not destroy them, but that he would,\r\nhowever, make them servants to the Egyptians, that they may learn\r\nwhether they will suffer less by serving men or God. So when Shishak had\r\ntaken the city without fighting, because Rehoboam was afraid, and\r\nreceived him into it, yet did not Shishak stand to the covenants he had\r\nmade, but he spoiled the temple, and emptied the treasures of God, and\r\nthose of the king, and carried off innumerable ten thousands of gold and\r\nsilver, and left nothing at all behind him. He also took away the\r\nbucklers of gold, and the shields, which Solomon the king had made; nay,\r\nhe did not leave the golden quivers which David had taken from the king\r\nof Zobah, and had dedicated to God; and when he had thus done, he\r\nreturned to his own kingdom. Now Herodotus of Halicarnassus mentions\r\nthis expedition, having only mistaken the king's name; and [in saying\r\nthat] he made war upon many other nations also, and brought Syria of\r\nPalestine into subjection, and took the men that were therein prisoners\r\nwithout fighting. Now it is manifest that he intended to declare that\r\nour nation was subdued by him; for he saith that he left behind him\r\npillars in the land of those that delivered themselves up to him without\r\nfighting, and engraved upon them the secret parts of women. Now our king\r\nRehoboam delivered up our city without fighting. He says withal 27 that\r\nthe Ethiopians learned to circumcise their privy parts from the\r\nEgyptians, with this addition, that the Phoenicians and Syrians that\r\nlive in Palestine confess that they learned it of the Egyptians. Yet it\r\nis evident that no other of the Syrians that live in Palestine, besides\r\nus alone, are circumcised. But as to such matters, let every one speak\r\nwhat is agreeable to his own opinion.\r\n\r\n4. When Shishak was gone away, king Rehoboam made bucklers and shields\r\nof brass, instead of those of gold, and delivered the same number of\r\nthem to the keepers of the king's palace. So, instead of warlike\r\nexpeditions, and that glory which results from those public actions, he\r\nreigned in great quietness, though not without fear, as being always an\r\nenemy to Jeroboam, and he died when he had lived fifty-seven years, and\r\nreigned seventeen. He was in his disposition a proud and a foolish man,\r\nand lost [part of his] dominions by not hearkening to his father's\r\nfriends. He was buried in Jerusalem, in the sepulchers of the kings; and\r\nhis son Abijah succeeded him in the kingdom, and this in the eighteenth\r\nyear of Jeroboam's reign over the ten tribes; and this was the\r\nconclusion of these affairs. It must be now our business to relate the\r\naffairs of Jeroboam, and how he ended his life; for he ceased not nor\r\nrested to be injurious to God, but every day raised up altars upon high\r\nmountains, and went on making priests out of the multitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. Concerning The Death Of A Son Of Jeroboam. How Jeroboam Was\r\nBeaten By Abijah Who Died A Little Afterward And Was Succeeded In His\r\nKingdom By Asa. And Also How, After The Death Of Jeroboam Baasha\r\nDestroyed His Son Nadab And All The House Of Jeroboam.\r\n\r\n1. However, God was in no long time ready to return Jeroboam's wicked\r\nactions, and the punishment they deserved, upon his own head, and upon\r\nthe heads of all his house. And whereas a son of his lay sick at that\r\ntime, who was called Abijah, he enjoined his wife to lay aside her\r\nrobes, and to take the garments belonging to a private person, and to go\r\nto Abijah the prophet, for that he was a wonderful man in foretelling\r\nfuturities, it having been he who told me that I should be king. He also\r\nenjoined her, when she came to him, to inquire concerning the child, as\r\nif she were a stranger, whether he should escape this distemper. So she\r\ndid as her husband bade her, and changed her habit, and came to the city\r\nShiloh, for there did Ahijah live. And as she was going into his house,\r\nhis eyes being then dim with age, God appeared to him, and informed him\r\nof two things; that the wife of Jeroboam was come to him, and what\r\nanswer he should make to her inquiry. Accordingly, as the woman was\r\ncoming into the house like a private person and a stranger, he cried\r\nout, \"Come in, O thou wife of Jeroboam! Why concealest thou thyself?\r\nThou art not concealed from God, who hath appeared to me, and informed\r\nme that thou wast coming, and hath given me in command what I shall say\r\nto thee.\" So he said that she should go away to her husband, and speak\r\nto him thus: \"Since I made thee a great man when thou wast little, or\r\nrather wast nothing, and rent the kingdom from the house of David, and\r\ngave it to thee, and thou hast been unmindful of these benefits, hast\r\nleft off my worship, hast made thee molten gods and honored them, I will\r\nin like manner cast thee down again, and will destroy all thy house, and\r\nmake them food for the dogs and the fowls; for a certain king is rising\r\nup, by appointment, over all this people, who shall leave none of the\r\nfamily of Jeroboam remaining. The multitude also shall themselves\r\npartake of the same punishment, and shall be cast out of this good land,\r\nand shall be scattered into the places beyond Euphrates, because they\r\nhave followed the wicked practices of their king, and have worshipped\r\nthe gods that he made, and forsaken my sacrifices. But do thou, O woman,\r\nmake haste back to thy husband, and tell him this message; but thou\r\nshalt then find thy son dead, for as thou enterest the city he shall\r\ndepart this life; yet shall he be buried with the lamentation of all the\r\nmultitude, and honored with a general mourning, for he was the only\r\nperson of goodness of Jeroboam's family.\" When the prophet had foretold\r\nthese events, the woman went hastily away with a disordered mind, and\r\ngreatly grieved at the death of the forenamed child. So she was in\r\nlamentation as she went along the road, and mourned for the death of her\r\nson, that was just at hand. She was indeed in a miserable condition at\r\nthe unavoidable misery of his death, and went apace, but in\r\ncircumstances very unfortunate, because of her son: for the greater\r\nhaste she made, she would the sooner see her son dead, yet was she\r\nforced to make such haste on account of her husband. Accordingly, when\r\nshe was come back, she found that the child had given up the ghost, as\r\nthe prophet had said; and she related all the circumstances to the king.\r\n\r\n2. Yet did not Jeroboam lay any of these things to heart, but he brought\r\ntogether a very numerous army, and made a warlike expedition against\r\nAbijah, the son of Rehoboam, who had succeeded his father in the kingdom\r\nof the two tribes; for he despised him because of his age. But when he\r\nheard of the expedition of Jeroboam, he was not affrighted at it, but\r\nproved of a courageous temper of mind, superior both to his youth and to\r\nthe hopes of his enemy; so he chose him an army out of the two tribes,\r\nand met Jeroboam at a place called Mount Zemaraim, and pitched his camp\r\nnear the other, and prepared everything necessary for the fight. His\r\narmy consisted of four hundred thousand, but the army of Jeroboam was\r\ndouble to it. Now as the armies stood in array, ready for action and\r\ndangers, and were just going to fight, Abijah stood upon an elevated\r\nplace, and beckoning with his hand, he desired the multitude and\r\nJeroboam himself to hear first with silence what he had to say. And when\r\nsilence was made, he began to speak, and told them,—\"God had consented\r\nthat David and his posterity should be their rulers for all time to\r\ncome, and this you yourselves are not unacquainted with; but I cannot\r\nbut wonder how you should forsake my father, and join yourselves to his\r\nservant Jeroboam, and are now here with him to fight against those who,\r\nby God's own determination, are to reign, and to deprive them of that\r\ndominion which they have still retained; for as to the greater part of\r\nit, Jeroboam is unjustly in possession of it. However, I do not suppose\r\nhe will enjoy it any longer; but when he hath suffered that punishment\r\nwhich God thinks due to him for what is past, he will leave off the\r\ntransgressions he hath been guilty of, and the injuries he hath offered\r\nto him, and which he hath still continued to offer and hath persuaded\r\nyou to do the same: yet when you were not any further unjustly treated\r\nby my father, than that he did not speak to you so as to please you, and\r\nthis only in compliance with the advice of wicked men, you in anger\r\nforsook him, as you pretended, but, in reality, you withdrew yourselves\r\nfrom God, and from his laws, although it had been right for you to have\r\nforgiven a man that was young in age, and not used to govern people, not\r\nonly some disagreeable words, but if his youth and unskilfulness in\r\naffairs had led him into some unfortunate actions, and that for the sake\r\nof his father Solomon, and the benefits you received from him; for men\r\nought to excuse the sins of posterity on account of the benefactions of\r\nparent; but you considered nothing of all this then, neither do you\r\nconsider it now, but come with so great an army against us. And what is\r\nit you depend upon for victory? Is it upon these golden heifers, and the\r\naltars that you have on high places, which are demonstrations of your\r\nimpiety, and not of religious worship? Or is it the exceeding multitude\r\nof your army which gives you such good hopes? Yet certainly there is no\r\nstrength at all in an army of many ten thousands, when the war is\r\nunjust; for we ought to place our surest hopes of success against our\r\nenemies in righteousness alone, and in piety towards God; which hope we\r\njustly have, since we have kept the laws from the beginning, and have\r\nworshipped our own God, who was not made by hands out of corruptible\r\nmatter; nor was he formed by a wicked king, in order to deceive the\r\nmultitude; but who is his own workmanship, 28 and the beginning and end\r\nof all things. I therefore give you counsel even now to repent, and to\r\ntake better advice, and to leave off the prosecution of the war; to call\r\nto mind the laws of your country, and to reflect what it hath been that\r\nhath advanced you to so happy a state as you are now in.\"\r\n\r\n3. This was the speech which Abijah made to the multitude. But while he\r\nwas still speaking Jeroboam sent some of his soldiers privately to\r\nencompass Abijab round about, on certain parts of the camp that were not\r\ntaken notice of; and when he was thus within the compass of the enemy,\r\nhis army was affrighted, and their courage failed them; but Abijah\r\nencouraged them, and exhorted them to place their hopes on God, for that\r\nhe was not encompassed by the enemy. So they all at once implored the\r\nDivine assistance, while the priests sounded with the trumpet, and they\r\nmade a shout, and fell upon their enemies, and God brake the courage and\r\ncast down the force of their enemies, and made Ahijah's army superior to\r\nthem; for God vouchsafed to grant them a wonderful and very famous\r\nvictory; and such a slaughter was now made of Jeroboam's army 29 as is\r\nnever recorded to have happened in any other war, whether it were of the\r\nGreeks or of the Barbarians, for they overthrew [and slew] five hundred\r\nthousand of their enemies, and they took their strongest cities by\r\nforce, and spoiled them; and besides those, they did the same to Bethel\r\nand her towns, and Jeshanah and her towns. And after this defeat\r\nJeroboam never recovered himself during the life of Abijah, who yet did\r\nnot long survive, for he reigned but three years, and was buried in\r\nJerusalem in the sepulchers of his forefathers. He left behind him\r\ntwenty-two sons, and sixteen daughters; and he had also those children\r\nby fourteen wives; and Asa his son succeeded in the kingdom; and the\r\nyoung man's mother was Michaiah. Under his reign the country of the\r\nIsraelites enjoyed peace for ten years.\r\n\r\n4. And so far concerning Abijah, the son of Rehoboam, the son of\r\nSolomon, as his history hath come down to us. But Jeroboam, the king of\r\nthe ten tribes, died when he had governed them two and twenty years;\r\nwhose son Nadab succeeded him, in the second year of the reign of Asa.\r\nNow Jeroboam's son governed two years, and resembled his father in\r\nimpiety and wickedness. In these two years he made an expedition against\r\nGibbethon, a city of the Philistines, and continued the siege in order\r\nto take it; but he was conspired against while he was there by a friend\r\nof his, whose name was Baasha, the son of Ahijah, and was slain; which\r\nBaasha took the kingdom after the other's death, and destroyed the whole\r\nhouse of Jeroboam. It also came to pass, according as God had foretold,\r\nthat some of Jeroboam's kindred that died in the city were torn to\r\npieces and devoured by dogs, and that others of them that died in the\r\nfields were torn and devoured by the fowls. So the house of Jeroboam\r\nsuffered the just punishment of his impiety, and of his wicked actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. How Zerah, King Of The Ethiopians, Was Beaten By Asa; And\r\nHow Asa, Upon Baasha's Making War Against Him, Invited The King Of The\r\nDamascens To Assist Him; And How, On The Destruction Of The House Of\r\nBaasha Zimri Got The Kingdom As Did His Son Ahab After Him.\r\n\r\n1. Now Asa, the king of Jerusalem, was of an excellent character, and\r\nhad a regard to God, and neither did nor designed any thing but what had\r\nrelation to the observation of the laws. He made a reformation of his\r\nkingdom, and cut off whatsoever was wicked therein, and purified it from\r\nevery impurity. Now he had an army of chosen men that were armed with\r\ntargets and spears; out of the tribe of Judah three hundred thousand;\r\nand out of the tribe of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand. But when he had already reigned ten years,\r\nZerah, king of Ethiopia, 30 made an expedition against him, with a great\r\narmy, of nine hundred thousand footmen, and one hundred thousand\r\nhorsemen, and three hundred chariots, and came as far as Mareshah, a\r\ncity that belonged to the tribe of Judah. Now when Zerah had passed so\r\nfar with his own army, Asa met him, and put his army in array over\r\nagainst him, in a valley called Zephathah, not far from the city; and\r\nwhen he saw the multitude of the Ethiopians, he cried out, and besought\r\nGod to give him the victory, and that he might kill many ten thousands\r\nof the enemy: \"For,\" said he, 31 \"I depend on nothing else but that\r\nassistance which I expect from thee, which is able to make the fewer\r\nsuperior to the more numerous, and the weaker to the stronger; and\r\nthence it is alone that I venture to meet Zerah, and fight him.\"\r\n\r\n2. While Asa was saying this, God gave him a signal of victory, and\r\njoining battle cheerfully on account of what God had foretold about it,\r\nhe slew a great many of the Ethiopians; and when he had put them to\r\nflight, he pursued them to the country of Gerar; and when they left off\r\nkilling their enemies, they betook themselves to spoiling them, [for the\r\ncity Gerar was already taken,] and to spoiling their camp, so that they\r\ncarried off much gold, and much silver, and a great deal of [other]\r\nprey, and camels, and great cattle, and flocks of sheep. Accordingly,\r\nwhen Asa and his army had obtained such a victory, and such wealth from\r\nGod, they returned to Jerusalem. Now as they were coming, a prophet,\r\nwhose name was Azariah, met them on the road, and bade them stop their\r\njourney a little; and began to say to them thus: That the reason why\r\nthey had obtained this victory from God was this, that they had showed\r\nthemselves righteous and religious men, and had done every thing\r\naccording to the will of God; that therefore, he said, if they\r\npersevered therein, God would grant that they should always overcome\r\ntheir enemies, and live happily; but that if they left off his worship,\r\nall things shall fall out on the contrary; and a time should come,\r\nwherein no true prophet shall be left in your whole multitude, nor a\r\npriest who shall deliver you a true answer from the oracle; but your\r\ncities shall be overthrown, and your nation scattered over the whole\r\nearth, and live the life of strangers and wanderers. So he advised them,\r\nwhile they had time, to be good, and not to deprive themselves of the\r\nfavor of God. When the king and the people heard this, they rejoiced;\r\nand all in common, and every one in particular, took great care to\r\nbehave themselves righteously. The king also sent some to take care that\r\nthose in the country should observe the laws also.\r\n\r\n3. And this was the state of Asa, king of the two tribes. I now return\r\nto Baasha, the king of the multitude of the Israelites, who slew Nadab,\r\nthe son of Jeroboam, and retained the government. He dwelt in the city\r\nTirzah, having made that his habitation, and reigned twenty-four years.\r\nHe became more wicked and impious than Jeroboam or his son. He did a\r\ngreat deal of mischief to the multitude, and was injurious to God, who\r\nsent the prophet Jehu, and told him beforehand that his whole family\r\nshould be destroyed, and that he would bring the same miseries on his\r\nhouse which had brought that of Jeroboam to ruin; because when he had\r\nbeen made king by him, he had not requited his kindness, by governing\r\nthe multitude righteously and religiously; which things, in the first\r\nplace, tended to their own happiness, and, in the next place, were\r\npleasing to God: that he had imitated this very wicked king Jeroboam;\r\nand although that man's soul had perished, yet did he express to the\r\nlife his wickedness; and he said that he should therefore justly\r\nexperience the like calamity with him, since he had been guilty of the\r\nlike wickedness. But Baasha, though he heard beforehand what miseries\r\nwould befall him and his whole family for their insolent behavior, yet\r\ndid not he leave off his wicked practices for the time to come, nor did\r\nhe care to appear other than worse and worse till he died; nor did he\r\nthen repent of his past actions, nor endeavor to obtain pardon of God\r\nfor them, but did as those do who have rewards proposed to them, when\r\nthey have once in earnest set about their work, they do not leave off\r\ntheir labors; for thus did Baasha, when the prophet foretold to him what\r\nwould come to pass, grow worse, as if what were threatened, the\r\nperdition of his family, and the destruction of his house, [which are\r\nreally among the greatest of evils,] were good things; and, as if he\r\nwere a combatant for wickedness, he every day took more and more pains\r\nfor it: and at last he took his army and assaulted a certain\r\nconsiderable city called Ramah, which was forty furlongs distant from\r\nJerusalem; and when he had taken it, he fortified it, having determined\r\nbeforehand to leave a garrison in it, that they might thence make\r\nexcursions, and do mischief to the kingdom of Asa.\r\n\r\n4. Whereupon Asa was afraid of the attempts the enemy might make upon\r\nhim; and considering with himself how many mischiefs this army that was\r\nleft in Ramah might do to the country over which he reigned, he sent\r\nambassadors to the king of the Damascenes, with gold and silver,\r\ndesiring his assistance, and putting him in mind that we have had a\r\nfriendship together from the times of our forefathers. So he gladly\r\nreceived that sum of money, and made a league with him, and broke the\r\nfriendship he had with Baasha, and sent the commanders of his own forces\r\nunto the cities that were under Baasha's dominion, and ordered them to\r\ndo them mischief. So they went and burnt some of them, and spoiled\r\nothers; Ijon, and Dan, and Abelmain 32 and many others. Now when the\r\nking of Israel heard this, he left off building and fortifying Ramah,\r\nand returned presently to assist his own people under the distresses\r\nthey were in; but Asa made use of the materials that were prepared for\r\nbuilding that city, for building in the same place two strong cities,\r\nthe one of which was called Geba, and the other Mizpah; so that after\r\nthis Baasha had no leisure to make expeditions against Asa, for he was\r\nprevented by death, and was buried in the city Tirzah; and Elah his son\r\ntook the kingdom, who, when he had reigned two years, died, being\r\ntreacherously slain by Zimri, the captain of half his army; for when he\r\nwas at Arza, his steward's house, he persuaded some of the horsemen that\r\nwere under him to assault Elah, and by that means he slew him when he\r\nwas without his armed men and his captains, for they were all busied in\r\nthe siege of Gibbethon, a city of the Philistines.\r\n\r\n5. When Zimri, the captain of the army, had killed Elah, he took the\r\nkingdom himself, and, according to Jehu's prophecy, slew all the house\r\nof Baasha; for it came to pass that Baasha's house utterly perished, on\r\naccount of his impiety, in the same manner as we have already described\r\nthe destruction of the house of Jeroboam. But the army that was\r\nbesieging Gibbethon, when they heard what had befallen the king, and\r\nthat when Zimri had killed him, he had gained the kingdom, they made\r\nOmri their general king, who drew off his army from Gibbethon, and came\r\nto Tirzah, where the royal palace was, and assaulted the city, and took\r\nit by force. But when Zimri saw that the city had none to defend it, he\r\nfled into the inmost part of the palace, and set it on fire, and burnt\r\nhimself with it, when he had reigned only seven days. Upon which the\r\npeople of Israel were presently divided, and part of them would have\r\nTibni to be king, and part Omri; but when those that were for Omri's\r\nruling had beaten Tibni, Omri reigned over all the multitude. Now it was\r\nin the thirtieth year of the reign of Asa that Omri reigned for twelve\r\nyears; six of these years he reigned in the city Tirzah, and the rest in\r\nthe city called Semareon, but named by the Greeks Samaria; but he\r\nhimself called it Semareon, from Semer, who sold him the mountain\r\nwhereon he built it. Now Omri was no way different from those kings that\r\nreigned before him, but that he grew worse than they, for they all\r\nsought how they might turn the people away from God by their daily\r\nwicked practices; and on that account it was that God made one of them\r\nto be slain by another, and that no one person of their families should\r\nremain. This Omri also died in Samaria and Ahab his son succeeded him.\r\n\r\n6. Now by these events we may learn what concern God hath for the\r\naffairs of mankind, and how he loves good men, and hates the wicked, and\r\ndestroys them root and branch; for many of these kings of Israel, they\r\nand their families, were miserably destroyed, and taken away one by\r\nanother, in a short time, for their transgression and wickedness; but\r\nAsa, who was king of Jerusalem, and of the two tribes, attained, by\r\nGod's blessing, a long and a blessed old age, for his piety and\r\nrighteousness, and died happily, when he had reigned forty and one\r\nyears; and when he was dead, his son Jehoshaphat succeeded him in the\r\ngovernment. He was born of Asa's wife Azubah. And all men allowed that\r\nhe followed the works of David his forefather, and this both in courage\r\nand piety; but we are not obliged now to speak any more of the affairs\r\nof this king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. How Ahab When He Had Taken Jezebel To Wife Became More\r\nWicked Than All The Kings That Had Been Before Him; Of The Actions Of\r\nThe Prophet Elijah, And What Befell Naboth.\r\n\r\n1. Now Ahab the king of Israel dwelt in Samaria, and held the government\r\nfor twenty-two years; and made no alteration in the conduct of the kings\r\nthat were his predecessors, but only in such things as were of his own\r\ninvention for the worse, and in his most gross wickedness. He imitated\r\nthem in their wicked courses, and in their injurious behavior towards\r\nGod, and more especially he imitated the transgression of Jeroboam; for\r\nhe worshipped the heifers that he had made; and he contrived other\r\nabsurd objects of worship besides those heifers: he also took to wife\r\nthe daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Tyrians and Sidonians, whose name\r\nwas Jezebel, of whom he learned to worship her own gods. This woman was\r\nactive and bold, and fell into so great a degree of impurity and\r\nmadness, that she built a temple to the god of the Tyrians, Which they\r\ncall Belus, and planted a grove of all sorts of trees; she also\r\nappointed priests and false prophets to this god. The king also himself\r\nhad many such about him, and so exceeded in madness and wickedness all\r\n[the kings] that went before him.\r\n\r\n2. There was now a prophet of God Almighty, of Thesbon, a country in\r\nGilead, that came to Ahab, and said to him, that God foretold he would\r\nnot send rain nor dew in those years upon the country but when he should\r\nappear. And when he had confirmed this by an oath, he departed into the\r\nsouthern parts, and made his abode by a brook, out of which he had water\r\nto drink; for as for his food, ravens brought it to him every day: but\r\nwhen that river was dried up for want of rain, he came to Zarephath, a\r\ncity not far from Sidon and Tyre, for it lay between them, and this at\r\nthe command of God, for [God told him] that he should there find a woman\r\nwho was a widow that should give him sustenance. So when he was not far\r\noff the city, he saw a woman that labored with her own hands, gathering\r\nof sticks: so God informed him that this was the woman who was to give\r\nhim sustenance. So he came and saluted her, and desired her to bring him\r\nsome water to drink; but as she was going so to do, he called to her,\r\nand would have her to bring him a loaf of bread also; whereupon she\r\naffirmed upon oath that she had at home nothing more than one handful of\r\nmeal, and a little oil, and that she was going to gather some sticks,\r\nthat she might knead it, and make bread for herself and her son; after\r\nwhich, she said, they must perish, and be consumed by the famine, for\r\nthey had nothing for themselves any longer. Hereupon he said, \"Go on\r\nwith good courage, and hope for better things; and first of all make me\r\na little cake, and bring it to me, for I foretell to thee that this\r\nvessel of meal and this cruse of oil shall not fail until God send\r\nrain.\" When the prophet had said this, she came to him, and made him the\r\nbefore-named cake; of which she had part for herself, and gave the rest\r\nto her son, and to the prophet also; nor did any thing of this fall\r\nuntil the drought ceased. Now Menander mentions this drought in his\r\naccount of the acts of Ethbaal, king of the Tyrians; where he says thus:\r\n\"Under him there was a want of rain from the month Hyperberetmus till\r\nthe month Hyperberetmus of the year following; but when he made\r\nsupplications, there came great thunders. This Ethbaal built the city\r\nBotrys in Phoenicia, and the city Auza in Libya.\" By these words he\r\ndesigned the want of rain that was in the days of Ahab, for at that time\r\nit was that Ethbaal also reigned over the Tyrians, as Menander informs\r\nus.\r\n\r\n3. Now this woman, of whom we spake before, that sustained the prophet,\r\nwhen her son was fallen into a distemper till he gave up the ghost, and\r\nappeared to be dead, came to the prophet weeping, and beating her\r\nbreasts with her hands, and sending out such expressions as her passions\r\ndictated to her, and complained to him that he had come to her to\r\nreproach her for her sins, and that on this account it was that her son\r\nwas dead. But he bid her be of good cheer, and deliver her son to him,\r\nfor that he would deliver him again to her alive. So when she had\r\ndelivered her son up to him, he carried him into an upper room, where he\r\nhimself lodged, and laid him down upon the bed, and cried unto God, and\r\nsaid, that God had not done well, in rewarding the woman who had\r\nentertained him and sustained him, by taking away her son; and he prayed\r\nthat he would send again the soul of the child into him, and bring him\r\nto life again. Accordingly God took pity on the mother, and was willing\r\nto gratify the prophet, that he might not seem to have come to her to do\r\nher a mischief, and the child, beyond all expectation, came to life\r\nagain. So the mother returned the prophet thanks, and said she was then\r\nclearly satisfied that God did converse with him.\r\n\r\n4. After a little while Elijah came to king Ahab, according to God's\r\nwill, to inform him that rain was coming. Now the famine had seized upon\r\nthe whole country, and there was a great want of what was necessary for\r\nsustenance, insomuch that it was after the recovery of the widow's son\r\nof Sarepta, God sent not only men that wanted it, but the earth itself\r\nalso, which did not produce enough for the horse and the other beasts of\r\nwhat was useful for them to feed on, by reason of the drought. So the\r\nking called for Obadiah, who was steward over his cattle, and said to\r\nhim, that he would have him go to the fountains of water, and to the\r\nbrooks, that if any herbs could be found for them, they might mow it\r\ndown, and reserve it for the beasts. And when he had sent persons all\r\nover the habitable earth 33 to discover the prophet Elijah, and they\r\ncould not find him, he bade Obadiah accompany him. So it was resolved\r\nthey should make a progress, and divide the ways between them; and\r\nObadiah took one road, and the king another. Now it happened that the\r\nsame time when queen Jezebel slew the prophets, that this Obadiah had\r\nhidden a hundred prophets, and had fed them with nothing but bread and\r\nwater. But when Obadiah was alone, and absent from the king, the prophet\r\nElijah met him; and Obadiah asked him who he was; and when he had\r\nlearned it from him, he worshipped him. Elijah then bid him go to the\r\nking, and tell him that I am here ready to wait on him. But Obadiah\r\nreplied, \"What evil have I done to thee, that thou sendest me to one who\r\nseeketh to kill thee, and hath sought over all the earth for thee? Or\r\nwas he so ignorant as not to know that the king had left no place\r\nuntouched unto which he had not sent persons to bring him back, in\r\norder, if they could take him, to have him put to death?\" For he told\r\nhim he was afraid lest God should appear to him again, and he should go\r\naway into another place; and that when the king should send him for\r\nElijah, and he should miss of him, and not be able to find him any where\r\nupon earth, he should be put to death. He desired him therefore to take\r\ncare of his preservation; and told him how diligently he had provided\r\nfor those of his own profession, and had saved a hundred prophets, when\r\nJezebel slew the rest of them, and had kept them concealed, and that\r\nthey had been sustained by him. But Elijah bade him fear nothing, but go\r\nto the king; and he assured him upon oath that he would certainly show\r\nhimself to Ahab that very day.\r\n\r\n5. So when Obadiah had informed the king that Elijah was there, Ahab met\r\nhim, and asked him, in anger, if he were the man that afflicted the\r\npeople of the Hebrews, and was the occasion of the drought they lay\r\nunder? But Elijah, without any flattery, said that he was himself the\r\nman, he and his house, which brought such sad afflictions upon them, and\r\nthat by introducing strange gods into their country, and worshipping\r\nthem, and by leaving their own, who was the only true God, and having no\r\nmanner of regard to him. However, he bade him go his way, and gather\r\ntogether all the people to him to Mount Carmel, with his own prophets,\r\nand those of his wife, telling him how many there were of them, as also\r\nthe prophets of the groves, about four hundred in number. And as all the\r\nmen whom Ahab sent for ran away to the forenamed mountain, the prophet\r\nElijah stood in the midst of them, and said, \"How long will you live\r\nthus in uncertainty of mind and opinion?\" He also exhorted them, that in\r\ncase they esteemed their own country God to be the true and the only\r\nGod, they would follow him and his commandments; but in case they\r\nesteemed him to be nothing, but had an opinion of the strange gods, and\r\nthat they ought to worship them, his counsel was, that they should\r\nfollow them. And when the multitude made no answer to what he said,\r\nElijah desired that, for a trial of the power of the strange gods, and\r\nof their own God, he, who was his only prophet, while they had four\r\nhundred, might take a heifer and kill it as a sacrifice, and lay it upon\r\npieces of wood, and not kindle any fire, and that they should do the\r\nsame things, and call upon their own gods to set the wood on fire; for\r\nif that were done, they would thence learn the nature of the true God.\r\nThis proposal pleased the people. So Elijah bade the prophets to choose\r\nout a heifer first, and kill it, and to call on their gods. But when\r\nthere appeared no effect of the prayer or invocation of the prophets\r\nupon their sacrifice, Elijah derided them, and bade them call upon their\r\ngods with a loud voice, for they might either be on a journey, or\r\nasleep; and when these prophets had done so from morning till noon, and\r\ncut themselves with swords and lances, 34 according to the customs of\r\ntheir country, and he was about to offer his sacrifice, he bade [the\r\nprophets] go away, but bade [the people] come near and observe what he\r\ndid, lest he should privately hide fire among the pieces of wood. So,\r\nupon the approach of the multitude, he took twelve stones, one for each\r\ntribe of the people of the Hebrews, and built an altar with them, and\r\ndug a very deep trench; and when he had laid the pieces of wood upon the\r\naltar, and upon them had laid the pieces of the sacrifices, he ordered\r\nthem to fill four barrels with the water of the fountain, and to pour it\r\nupon the altar, till it ran over it, and till the trench was filled with\r\nthe water poured into it. When he had done this, he began to pray to\r\nGod, and to invocate him to make manifest his power to a people that had\r\nalready been in an error a long time; upon which words a fire came on a\r\nsudden from heaven in the sight of the multitude, and fell upon the\r\naltar, and consumed the sacrifice, till the very water was set on fire,\r\nand the place was become dry.\r\n\r\n6. Now when the Israelites saw this, they fell down upon the ground, and\r\nworshipped one God, and called him The great and the only true God; but\r\nthey called the others mere names, framed by the evil and vile opinions\r\nof men. So they caught their prophets, and, at the command of Elijah,\r\nslew them. Elijah also said to the king, that he should go to dinner\r\nwithout any further concern, for that in a little time he would see God\r\nsend them rain. Accordingly Ahab went his way. But Elijah went up to the\r\nhighest top of Mount Carmel, and sat down upon the ground, and leaned\r\nhis head upon his knees, and bade his servant go up to a certain\r\nelevated place, and look towards the sea, and when he should see a cloud\r\nrising any where, he should give him notice of it, for till that time\r\nthe air had been clear. When the Servant had gone up, and had said many\r\ntimes that he saw nothing, at the seventh time of his going up, he said\r\nthat he saw a small black thing in the sky, not larger than a man's\r\nfoot. When Elijah heard that, he sent to Ahab, and desired him to go\r\naway to the city before the rain came down. So he came to the city\r\nJezreel; and in a little time the air was all obscured, and covered with\r\nclouds, and a vehement storm of wind came upon the earth, and with it a\r\ngreat deal of rain; and the prophet was under a Divine fury, and ran\r\nalong with the king's chariot unto Jezreel a city of Izar 35\r\n[Issaachar].\r\n\r\n7. When Jezebel, the wife of Ahab, understood what signs Elijah had\r\nwrought, and how he had slain her prophets, she was angry, and sent\r\nmessengers to him, and by them threatened to kill him, as he had\r\ndestroyed her prophets. At this Elijah was affrighted, and fled to the\r\ncity called Beersheba, which is situate at the utmost limits of the\r\ncountry belonging to the tribe of Judah, towards the land of Edom; and\r\nthere he left his servant, and went away into the desert. He prayed also\r\nthat he might die, for that he was not better than his fathers, nor need\r\nhe be very desirous to live, when they were dead; and he lay and slept\r\nunder a certain tree; and when somebody awakened him, and he was risen\r\nup, he found food set by him and water: so when he had eaten, and\r\nrecovered his strength by that his food, he came to that mountain which\r\nis called Sinai, where it is related that Moses received his laws from\r\nGod; and finding there a certain hollow cave, he entered into it, and\r\ncontinued to make his abode in it. But when a certain voice came to him,\r\nbut from whence he knew not, and asked him, why he was come thither, and\r\nhad left the city? he said, that because he had slain the prophets of\r\nthe foreign gods, and had persuaded the people that he alone whom they\r\nhad worshipped from the beginning was God, he was sought for by the\r\nking's wife to be punished for so doing. And when he had heard another\r\nvoice, telling him that he should come out the next day into the open\r\nair, and should thereby know what he was to do, he came out of the cave\r\nthe next day accordingly, When he both heard an earthquake, and saw the\r\nbright splendor of a fire; and after a silence made, a Divine voice\r\nexhorted him not to be disturbed with the circumstances he was in, for\r\nthat none of his enemies should have power over him. The voice also\r\ncommanded him to return home, and to ordain Jehu, the son of Nimshi, to\r\nbe king over their own multitude; and Hazael, of Damascus, to be over\r\nthe Syrians; and Elisha, of the city Abel, to be a prophet in his stead;\r\nand that of the impious multitude, some should be slain by Hazael, and\r\nothers by Jehu. So Elijah, upon hearing this charge, returned into the\r\nland of the Hebrews. And when he found Elisha, the son of Shaphat,\r\nploughing, and certain others with him, driving twelve yoke of oxen, he\r\ncame to him, and cast his own garment upon him; upon which Elisha began\r\nto prophesy presently, and leaving his oxen, he followed Elijah. And\r\nwhen he desired leave to salute his parents, Elijah gave him leave so to\r\ndo; and when he had taken his leave of them, he followed him, and became\r\nthe disciple and the servant of Elijah all the days of his life. And\r\nthus have I despatched the affairs in which this prophet was concerned.\r\n\r\n8. Now there was one Naboth, of the city Izar, [Jezreel,] who had a\r\nfield adjoining to that of the king: the king would have persuaded him\r\nto sell him that his field, which lay so near to his own lands, at what\r\nprice he pleased, that he might join them together, and make them one\r\nfarm; and if he would not accept of money for it, he gave him leave to\r\nchoose any of his other fields in its stead. But Naboth said he would\r\nnot do so, but would keep the possession of that land of his own, which\r\nhe had by inheritance from his father. Upon this the king was grieved,\r\nas if he had received an injury, when he could not get another man's\r\npossession, and he would neither wash himself, nor take any food: and\r\nwhen Jezebel asked him what it was that troubled him, and why he would\r\nneither wash himself, nor eat either dinner or supper, he related to her\r\nthe perverseness of Naboth, and how, when he had made use of gentle\r\nwords to him, and such as were beneath the royal authority, he had been\r\naffronted, and had not obtained what he desired. However, she persuaded\r\nhim not to be cast down at this accident, but to leave off his grief,\r\nand return to the usual care of his body, for that she would take care\r\nto have Naboth punished; and she immediately sent letters to the rulers\r\nof the Israelites [Jezreelites] in Ahab's name, and commanded them to\r\nfast and to assemble a congregation, and to set Naboth at the head of\r\nthem, because he was of an illustrious family, and to have three bold\r\nmen ready to bear witness that he had blasphemed God and the king, and\r\nthen to stone him, and slay him in that manner. Accordingly, when Naboth\r\nhad been thus testified against, as the queen had written to them, that\r\nhe had blasphemed against God and Ahab the king, she desired him to take\r\npossession of Naboth's vineyard on free cost. So Ahab was glad at what\r\nhad been done, and rose up immediately from the bed whereon he lay to go\r\nto see Naboth's vineyard; but God had great indignation at it, and sent\r\nElijah the prophet to the field of Naboth, to speak to Ahab, and to say\r\nto him, that he had slain the true owner of that field unjustly. And as\r\nsoon as he came to him, and the king had said that he might do with him\r\nwhat he pleased, [for he thought it a reproach to him to be thus caught\r\nin his sin,] Elijah said, that in that very place in which the dead body\r\nof Naboth was eaten by dogs both his own blood and that of his wife's\r\nshould be shed, and that all his family should perish, because he had\r\nbeen so insolently wicked, and had slain a citizen unjustly, and\r\ncontrary to the laws of his country. Hereupon Ahab began to be sorry for\r\nthe things he had done, and to repent of them; and he put on sackcloth,\r\nand went barefoot 36 and would not touch any food; he also confessed his\r\nsins, and endeavored thus to appease God. But God said to the prophet,\r\nthat while Ahab was living he would put off the punishment of his\r\nfamily, because he repented of those insolent crimes he had been guilty\r\nof, but that still he would fulfill his threatening under Ahab's son;\r\nwhich message the prophet delivered to the king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. How Hadad King Of Damascus And Of Syria, Made Two\r\nExpeditions Against Ahab And Was Beaten.\r\n\r\n1. When the affairs of Ahab were thus, at that very time the son of\r\nHadad, [Benhadad,] who was king of the Syrians and of Damascus, got\r\ntogether an army out of all his country, and procured thirty-two kings\r\nbeyond Euphrates to be his auxiliaries: so he made an expedition against\r\nAhab; but because Ahab's army was not like that of Benhadad, he did not\r\nset it in array to fight him, but having shut up every thing that was in\r\nthe country in the strongest cities he had, he abode in Samaria himself,\r\nfor the walls about it were very strong, and it appeared to be not\r\neasily to be taken in other respects also. So the king of Syria took his\r\narmy with him, and came to Samaria, and placed his army round about the\r\ncity, and besieged it. He also sent a herald to Ahab, and desired he\r\nwould admit the ambassadors he would send him, by whom he would let him\r\nknow his pleasure. So, upon the king of Israel's permission for him to\r\nsend, those ambassador's came, and by their king's command spake thus:\r\nThat Ahab's riches, and his children, and his wives were Benhadad's, and\r\nif he would make an agreement, and give him leave to take as much of\r\nwhat he had as he pleased, he would withdraw his army, and leave off the\r\nsiege. Upon this Ahab bade the ambassadors to go back, and tell their\r\nking, that both he himself and all that he hath are his possessions. And\r\nwhen these ambassadors had told this to Benhadad, he sent them to him\r\nagain, and desired, since he confessed that all he had was his, that he\r\nwould admit those servants of his which he should send the next day; and\r\nhe commanded him to deliver to those whom he should send whatsoever,\r\nupon their searching his palace, and the houses of his friends and\r\nkindred, they should find to be excellent in its kind, but that what did\r\nnot please them they should leave to him. At this second embassage of\r\nthe king of Syria, Ahab was surprised, and gathered together the\r\nmultitude to a congregation, and told them that, for himself, he was\r\nready, for their safety and peace, to give up his own wives and children\r\nto the enemy, and to yield to him all his own possessions, for that was\r\nwhat the Syrian king required at his first embassage; but that now he\r\ndesires to send his servants to search all their houses, and in them to\r\nleave nothing that is excellent in its kind, seeking an occasion of\r\nfighting against him, \"as knowing that I would not spare what is mine\r\nown for your sakes, but taking a handle from the disagreeable terms he\r\noffers concerning you to bring a war upon us; however, I will do what\r\nyou shall resolve is fit to be done.\" But the multitude advised him to\r\nhearken to none of his proposals, but to despise him, and be in\r\nreadiness to fight him. Accordingly, when he had given the ambassadors\r\nthis answer to be reported, that he still continued in the mind to\r\ncomply with what terms he at first desired, for the safety of the\r\ncitizens; but as for his second desires, he cannot submit to them,—he\r\ndismissed them.\r\n\r\n2. Now when Benhadad heard this, he had indignation, and sent\r\nambassadors to Ahab the third time, and threatened that his army would\r\nraise a bank higher than those walls, in confidence of whose strength he\r\ndespised him, and that by only each man of his army taking a handful of\r\nearth; hereby making a show of the great number of his army, and aiming\r\nto affright him. Ahab answered, that he ought not to vaunt himself when\r\nhe had only put on his armor, but when he should have conquered his\r\nenemies in the battle. So the ambassadors came back, and found the king\r\nat supper with his thirty-two kings, and informed him of Ahab's answer;\r\nwho then immediately gave order for proceeding thus: To make lines round\r\nthe city, and raise a bulwark, and to prosecute the siege all manner of\r\nways. Now, as this was doing, Ahab was in a great agony, and all his\r\npeople with him; but he took courage, and was freed from his fears, upon\r\na certain prophet coming to him, and saying to him, that God had\r\npromised to subdue so many ten thousands of his enemies under him. And\r\nwhen he inquired by whose means the victory was to be obtained, he said,\r\n\"By the sons of the princes; but under thy conduct as their leader, by\r\nreason of their unskilfulness [in war].\" Upon which he called for the\r\nsons of the princes, and found them to be two hundred and thirty-two\r\npersons. So when he was informed that the king of Syria had betaken\r\nhimself to feasting and repose, he opened the gates, and sent out the\r\nprinces' sons. Now when the sentinels told Benhadad of it, he sent some\r\nto meet them, and commanded them, that if these men were come out for\r\nfighting, they should bind them, and bring them to him; and that if they\r\ncame out peaceably, they should do the same. Now Ahab had another army\r\nready within the walls, but the sons of the princes fell upon the out-\r\nguard, and slew many of them, and pursued the rest of them to the camp;\r\nand when the king of Israel saw that these had the upper hand, he sent\r\nout all the rest of his army, which, falling suddenly upon the Syrians,\r\nbeat them, for they did not think they would have come out; on which\r\naccount it was that they assaulted them when they were naked 37 and\r\ndrunk, insomuch that they left all their armor behind them when they\r\nfled out of the camp, and the king himself escaped with difficulty, by\r\nfleeing away on horseback. But Ahab went a great way in pursuit of the\r\nSyrians; and when he had spoiled their camp, which contained a great\r\ndeal of wealth, and moreover a large quantity of gold and silver, he\r\ntook Benhadad's chariots and horses, and returned to the city; but as\r\nthe prophet told him he ought to have his army ready, because the Syrian\r\nking would make another expedition against him the next year, Ahab was\r\nbusy in making provision for it accordingly.\r\n\r\n3. Now Benhadad, when he had saved himself, and as much of his army as\r\nhe could, out of the battle, he consulted with his friends how he might\r\nmake another expedition against the Israelites. Now those friends\r\nadvised him not to fight with them on the hills, because their God was\r\npotent in such places, and thence it had come to pass that they had very\r\nlately been beaten; but they said, that if they joined battle with them\r\nin the plain, they should beat them. They also gave him this further\r\nadvice, to send home those kings whom he had brought as his auxiliaries,\r\nbut to retain their army, and to set captains over it instead of the\r\nkings, and to raise an army out of their country, and let them be in the\r\nplace of the former who perished in the battle, together with horses and\r\nchariots. So he judged their counsel to be good, and acted according to\r\nit in the management of the army.\r\n\r\n4. At the beginning of the spring, Benhadad took his army with him, and\r\nled it against the Hebrews; and when he was come to a certain city which\r\nwas called Aphek, he pitched his camp in the great plain. Ahab also went\r\nto meet him with his army, and pitched his camp over against him,\r\nalthough his army was a very small one, if it were compared with the\r\nenemy's; but the prophet came again to him, and told him, that God would\r\ngive him the victory, that he might demonstrate his own power to be, not\r\nonly on the mountains, but on the plains also; which it seems was\r\ncontrary to the opinion of the Syrians. So they lay quiet in their camp\r\nseven days; but on the last of those days, when the enemies came out of\r\ntheir camp, and put themselves in array in order to fight, Ahab also\r\nbrought out his own army; and when the battle was joined, and they\r\nfought valiantly, he put the enemy to flight, and pursued them, and\r\npressed upon them, and slew them; nay, they were destroyed by their own\r\nchariots, and by one another; nor could any more than a few of them\r\nescape to their own city Aphek, who were also killed by the walls\r\nfalling upon them, being in number twenty-seven thousand. 38 Now there\r\nwere slain in this battle a hundred thousand more; but Benhadad, the\r\nking of the Syrians, fled away, with certain others of his most faithful\r\nservants, and hid himself in a cellar under ground; and when these told\r\nhim that the kings of Israel were humane and merciful men, and that they\r\nmight make use of the usual manner of supplication, and obtain\r\ndeliverance from Ahab, in case he would give them leave to go to him, he\r\ngave them leave accordingly. So they came to Ahab, clothed in sackcloth,\r\nwith ropes about their heads, (for this was the ancient manner of\r\nsupplication among the Syrians,) 39 and said, that Benhadad desired he\r\nwould save him, and that he would ever be a servant to him for that\r\nfavor. Ahab replied he was glad that he was alive, and not hurt in the\r\nbattle; and he further promised him the same honor and kindness that a\r\nman would show to his brother. So they received assurances upon oath\r\nfrom him, that when he came to him he should receive no harm from him,\r\nand then went and brought him out of the cellar wherein he was hid, and\r\nbrought him to Ahab as he sat in his chariot. So Benhadad worshipped\r\nhim; and Ahab gave him his hand, and made him come up to him into his\r\nchariot, and kissed him, and bid him be of good cheer, and not to expect\r\nthat any mischief should be done to him. So Benhadad returned him\r\nthanks, and professed that he also would remember his kindness to him\r\nall the days of his life; and promised he would restore those cities of\r\nthe Israelites which the former kings had taken from them, and grant\r\nthat he should have leave to come to Damascus, as his forefathers had to\r\ncome to Samaria. So they confirmed their covenant by oaths, and Ahab\r\nmade him many presents, and sent him back to his own kingdom. And this\r\nwas the conclusion of the war that Benhadad made against Ahab and the\r\nIsraelites.\r\n\r\n5. But a certain prophet, whose name was Micaiah, 40 came to one of the\r\nIsraelites, and bid him smite him on the head, for by so doing he would\r\nplease God; but when he would not do so, he foretold to him, that since\r\nhe disobeyed the commands of God, he should meet with a lion, and be\r\ndestroyed by him. When that sad accident had befallen the man, the\r\nprophet came again to another, and gave him the same injunction; so he\r\nsmote him, and wounded his skull; upon which he bound up his head, and\r\ncame to the king, and told him that he had been a soldier of his, and\r\nhad the custody of one of the prisoners committed to him by an officer,\r\nand that the prisoner being run away, he was in danger of losing his own\r\nlife by the means of that officer, who had threatened him, that if the\r\nprisoner escaped he would kill him. And when Ahab had said that he would\r\njustly die, he took off the binding about his head, and was known by the\r\nking to be Micaiah the prophet, who made use of this artifice as a\r\nprelude to his following words; for he said that God would punish him\r\nwho had suffered Benhadad, a blasphemer against him, to escape\r\npunishment; and that he would so bring it about, that he should die by\r\nthe other's means 41 and his people by the other's army. Upon which Ahab\r\nwas very angry at the prophet, and gave commandment that he should be\r\nput in prison, and there kept; but for himself, he was in confusion at\r\nthe words of Micaiah, and returned to his own house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15. Concerning Jehoshaphat The King Of Jerusalem And How Ahab\r\nMade An Expedition Against The Syrians And Was Assisted Therein By\r\nJehoshaphat, But Was Himself Overcome In Battle And Perished Therein.\r\n\r\n1. And these were the circumstances in which Ahab was. But I now return\r\nto Jehoshaphat, the king of Jerusalem, who, when he had augmented his\r\nkingdom, had set garrisons in the cities of the countries belonging to\r\nhis subjects, and had put such garrisons no less into those cities which\r\nwere taken out of the tribe of Ephraim by his grandfather Abijah, when\r\nJeroboam reigned over the ten tribes [than he did into the other]. But\r\nthen he had God favorable and assisting to him, as being both righteous\r\nand religious, and seeking to do somewhat every day that should be\r\nagreeable and acceptable to God. The kings also that were round about\r\nhim honored him with the presents they made him, till the riches that he\r\nhad acquired were immensely great, and the glory he had gained was of a\r\nmost exalted nature.\r\n\r\n2. Now, in the third year of this reign, he called together the rulers\r\nof the country, and the priests, and commanded them to go round the\r\nland, and teach all the people that were under him, city by city, the\r\nlaws of Moses, and to keep them, and to be diligent in the worship of\r\nGod. With this the whole multitude was so pleased, that they were not so\r\neagerly set upon or affected with any thing so much as the observation\r\nof the laws. The neighboring nations also continued to love Jehoshaphat,\r\nand to be at peace with him. The Philistines paid their appointed\r\ntribute, and the Arabians supplied him every year with three hundred and\r\nsixty lambs, and as many kids of the goats. He also fortified the great\r\ncities, which were many in number, and of great consequence. He prepared\r\nalso a mighty army of soldiers and weapons against their enemies. Now\r\nthe army of men that wore their armor, was three hundred thousand of the\r\ntribe of Judah, of whom Adnah was the chief; but John was chief of two\r\nhundred thousand. The same man was chief of the tribe of Benjamin, and\r\nhad two hundred thousand archers under him. There was another chief,\r\nwhose name was Jehozabad, who had a hundred and fourscore thousand armed\r\nmen. This multitude was distributed to be ready for the king's service,\r\nbesides those whom he sent to the best fortified cities.\r\n\r\n3. Jehoshaphat took for his son Jehoram to wife the daughter of Ahab,\r\nthe king of the ten tribes, whose name was Athaliah. And when, after\r\nsome time, he went to Samaria, Ahab received him courteously, and\r\ntreated the army that followed him in a splendid manner, with great\r\nplenty of corn and wine, and of slain beasts; and desired that he would\r\njoin with him in his war against the king of Syria, that he might\r\nrecover from him the city Ramoth, in Gilead; for though it had belonged\r\nto his father, yet had the king of Syria's father taken it away from\r\nhim; and upon Jehoshaphat's promise to afford him his assistance, [for\r\nindeed his army was not inferior to the other,] and his sending for his\r\narmy from Jerusalem to Samaria, the two kings went out of the city, and\r\neach of them sat on his own throne, and each gave their orders to their\r\nseveral armies. Now Jehoshaphat bid them call some of the prophets, if\r\nthere were any there, and inquire of them concerning this expedition\r\nagainst the king of Syria, whether they would give them counsel to make\r\nthat expedition at this time, for there was peace at that time between\r\nAhab and the king of Syria, which had lasted three years, from the time\r\nhe had taken him captive till that day.\r\n\r\n4. So Ahab called his own prophets, being in number about four hundred,\r\nand bid them inquire of God whether he would grant him the victory, if\r\nhe made an expedition against Benhadad, and enable him to overthrow that\r\ncity, for whose sake it was that he was going to war. Now these prophets\r\ngave their counsel for making this expedition, and said that he would\r\nbeat the king of Syria, and, as formerly, would reduce him under his\r\npower. But Jehoshaphat, understanding by their words that they were\r\nfalse prophets, asked Ahab whether there were not some other prophet,\r\nand he belonging to the true God, that we may have surer information\r\nconcerning futurities. Hereupon Ahab said there was indeed such a one,\r\nbut that he hated him, as having prophesied evil to him, and having\r\nforetold that he should be overcome and slain by the king of Syria, and\r\nthat for this cause he had him now in prison, and that his name was\r\nMicaiah, the son of Imlah. But upon Jehoshaphat's desire that he might\r\nbe produced, Ahab sent a eunuch, who brought Micaiah to him. Now the\r\neunuch had informed him by the way, that all the other prophets had\r\nforetold that the king should gain the victory; but he said, that it was\r\nnot lawful for him to lie against God, but that he must speak what he\r\nshould say to him about the king, whatsoever it were. When he came to\r\nAhab, and he had adjured him upon oath to speak the truth to him, he\r\nsaid that God had shown to him the Israelites running away, and pursued\r\nby the Syrians, and dispersed upon the mountains by them, as flocks of\r\nsheep are dispersed when their shepherd is slain. He said further, that\r\nGod signified to him, that those Israelites should return in peace to\r\ntheir own home, and that he only should fall in the battle. When Micaiah\r\nhad thus spoken, Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, \"I told thee a little while\r\nago the disposition of the man with regard to me, and that he uses to\r\nprophesy evil to me.\" Upon which Micaiah replied, that he ought to hear\r\nall, whatsoever it be, that God foretells; and that in particular, they\r\nwere false prophets that encouraged him to make this war in hope of\r\nvictory, whereas he must fight and be killed. Whereupon the king was in\r\nsuspense with himself: but Zedekiah, one of those false prophets, came\r\nnear, and exhorted him not to hearken to Micaiah, for he did not at all\r\nspeak truth; as a demonstration of which he instanced in what Elijah had\r\nsaid, who was a better prophet in foretelling futurities than Micaiah 42\r\nfor he foretold that the dogs should lick his blood in the city of\r\nJezreel, in the field of Naboth, as they licked the blood of Naboth, who\r\nby his means was there stoned to death by the multitude; that therefore\r\nit was plain that this Micaiah was a liar, as contradicting a greater\r\nprophet than himself, and saying that he should be slain at three days'\r\njourney distance: \"and [said he] you shall soon know whether he be a\r\ntrue prophet, and hath the power of the Divine Spirit; for I will smite\r\nhim, and let him then hurt my hand, as Jadon caused the hand of Jeroboam\r\nthe king to wither when he would have caught him; for I suppose thou\r\nhast certainly heard of that accident.\" So when, upon his smiting\r\nMicaiah, no harm happened to him, Ahab took courage, and readily led his\r\narmy against the king of Syria; for, as I suppose, fate was too hard for\r\nhim, and made him believe that the false prophets spake truer than the\r\ntrue one, that it might take an occasion of bringing him to his end.\r\nHowever, Zedekiah made horns of iron, and said to Ahab, that God made\r\nthose horns signals, that by them he should overthrow all Syria. But\r\nMicaiah replied, that Zedekiah, in a few days, should go from one secret\r\nchamber to another to hide himself, that he might escape the punishment\r\nof his lying. Then did the king give orders that they should take\r\nMicaiah away, and guard him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to\r\ngive him nothing but bread and water.\r\n\r\n5. Then did Ahab, and Jehoshaphat the king of Jerusalem, take their\r\nforces, and marched to Ramoth a city of Gilead; and when the king of\r\nSyria heard of this expedition, he brought out his army to oppose them,\r\nand pitched his camp not far from Ramoth. Now Ahab and Jehoshaphat had\r\nagreed that Ahab should lay aside his royal robes, but that the king of\r\nJerusalem should put on his [Ahab's] proper habit, and stand before the\r\narmy, in order to disprove, by this artifice, what Micaiah had foretold.\r\n43 But Ahab's fate found him out without his robes; for Benhadad, the\r\nking of Assyria, had charged his army, by the means of their commanders,\r\nto kill nobody else but only the king of Israel. So when the Syrians,\r\nupon their joining battle with the Israelites, saw Jehoshaphat stand\r\nbefore the army, and conjectured that he was Ahab, they fell violently\r\nupon him, and encompassed him round; but when they were near, and knew\r\nthat it was not he, they all returned back; and while the fight lasted\r\nfrom the morning till late in the evening, and the Syrians were\r\nconquerors, they killed nobody, as their king had commanded them. And\r\nwhen they sought to kill Ahab alone, but could not find him, there was a\r\nyoung nobleman belonging to king Benhadad, whose name was Naaman; he\r\ndrew his bow against the enemy, and wounded the king through his\r\nbreastplate, in his lungs. Upon this Ahab resolved not to make his\r\nmischance known to his army, lest they should run away; but he bid the\r\ndriver of his chariot to turn it back, and carry him out of the battle,\r\nbecause he was sorely and mortally wounded. However, he sat in his\r\nchariot and endured the pain till sunset, and then he fainted away and\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n6. And now the Syrian army, upon the coming on of the night, retired to\r\ntheir camp; and when the herald belonging to the camp gave notice that\r\nAhab was dead, they returned home; and they took the dead body of Ahab\r\nto Samaria, and buried it there; but when they had washed his chariot in\r\nthe fountain of Jezreel, which was bloody with the dead body of the\r\nking, they acknowledged that the prophecy of Elijah was true, for the\r\ndogs licked his blood, and the harlots continued afterwards to wash\r\nthemselves in that fountain; but still he died at Ramoth, as Micaiah had\r\nforetold. And as what things were foretold should happen to Ahab by the\r\ntwo prophets came to pass, we ought thence to have high notions of God,\r\nand every where to honor and worship him, and never to suppose that what\r\nis pleasant and agreeable is worthy of belief before what is true, and\r\nto esteem nothing more advantageous than the gift of prophecy 44 and\r\nthat foreknowledge of future events which is derived from it, since God\r\nshows men thereby what we ought to avoid. We may also guess, from what\r\nhappened to this king, and have reason to consider the power of fate;\r\nthat there is no way of avoiding it, even when we know it. It creeps\r\nupon human souls, and flatters them with pleasing hopes, till it leads\r\nthem about to the place where it will be too hard for them. Accordingly\r\nAhab appears to have been deceived thereby, till he disbelieved those\r\nthat foretold his defeat; but, by giving credit to such as foretold what\r\nwas grateful to him, was slain; and his son Ahaziah succeeded him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ This execution upon Joab, as a murderer, by slaying him,\r\neven when he had taken sanctuary at God's altar, is perfectly agreeable\r\nto the law of Moses, which enjoins, that \"if a man come presumptuously\r\nupon his neighbor to slay him with guile, thou shalt take him from mine\r\naltar that he die,\" Exodus 21:14.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ This building of the walls of Jerusalem, soon after David's\r\ndeath, illustrates the conclusion of the 51st Psalm, where David prays,\r\n\"Build thou the walls of Jerusalem;\" they being, it seems, unfinished or\r\nimperfect at that time.

Nor\r\ndid the governor's usual allowance of forty shekels of silver a-day,\r\nver. 15, amount to 45 a day, nor to 1800 a-year. Nor does it indeed\r\nappear that, under the judges, or under Samuel the prophet, there was\r\nany such public allowance to those governors at all. Those great charges\r\nupon the public for maintaining courts came in with kings, as God\r\nforetold they would, 1 Samuel 8:11-18.\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ Some pretended fragments of these books of conjuration of\r\nSolomon are still extant in Fabricius's Cod.

Nor\r\ndoes Josephus's strange account of the root Baara [Of the War, B. VIII.\r\nch. 6. sect. 3: seem to be other than that of its magical use in such\r\nconjurations.

The\r\nresult of my inquiries in this matter, with the addition of some later\r\nimprovements, stands thus: That the best testimonies hereto relating,\r\nimply, that Paketyrus, or Oldest Tyre, was no other than that most\r\nancient smaller fort or city Tyre, situated on the continent, and\r\nmentioned in Joshua 19:29, out of which the Canaanite or Phoenician\r\ninhabitants were driven into a large island, that lay not far off in the\r\nsea, by Joshua: that this island was then joined to the continent at the\r\npresent remains of Paketyrus, by a neck of land over against Solomon's\r\ncisterns, still so called; and the city's fresh water, probably, was\r\ncarried along in pipes by that neck of land; and that this island was\r\ntherefore, in strictness, no other than a peninsula, having villages in\r\nits fields, Ezekiel 26:6, and a wall about it, Amos 1:10, and the city\r\nwas not of so great reputation as Sitlon for some ages: that it was\r\nattacked both by sea and land by Salmanasser, as Josephus informs us,\r\nAntiq. B. IX. ch. 14. sect. 2, and afterwards came to be the metropolis\r\nof Phoenicia; and was afterwards taken and destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar,\r\naccording to the numerous Scripture prophecies thereto relating, Isaiah\r\n23.; Jeremiah 25:22; 27:3; 47:4; Ezekiel 26., 27., 28.: that seventy\r\nyears after that destruction by Nebuchadnezzar, this city was in some\r\nmeasure revived and rebuilt, Isaiah 23:17, 18, but that, as the prophet\r\nEzekiel had foretold, chap. 26:3-5, 14; 27: 34, the sea arose higher\r\nthan before, till at last it over flowed, not only the neck of land, but\r\nthe main island or peninsula itself, and destroyed that old and famous\r\ncity for ever: that, however, there still remained an adjoining smaller\r\nisland, once connected to Old Tyre itself by Hiram, which was afterwards\r\ninhabited; to which Alexander the Great, with incredible pains, raised a\r\nnew bank or causeway: and that it plainly appears from Ifaundreh, a most\r\nauthentic eye-witness, that the old large and famous city, on the\r\noriginal large island, is now laid so generally under water, that scarce\r\nmore than forty acres of it, or rather of that adjoining small island\r\nremain at this day; so that, perhaps, not above a hundredth part of the\r\nfirst island and city is now above water. This was foretold in the same\r\nprophecies of Ezekiel; and according to them, as Mr. Maundrell\r\ndistinctly observes, these poor remains of Old Tyre are now \"become like\r\nthe top of a rock, a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the\r\nsea.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 (return) [ Of the temple of Solomon here described by Josephus, in\r\nthis and the following sections of this chapter, see my description of\r\nthe temples belonging to this work, ch. 13, These small rooms, or side\r\nchambers, seem to have been, by Josephus's description, no less than\r\ntwenty cubits high a piece, otherwise there must have been a large\r\ninterval between one and the other that was over it; and this with\r\ndouble floors, the one of six cubits distance from the floor beneath it,\r\nas 1 Kings 6:5]\r\n\r\n\r\n8 (return) [ Josephus says here that the cherubims were of solid gold,\r\nand only five cubits high, while our Hebrew copies [1 Kings 6;23, 28:\r\nsay they were of the olive tree, and the LXXX. of the cypress tree, and\r\nonly overlaid with gold; and both agree they were ten cubits high. I\r\nsuppose the number here is falsely transcribed, and that Josephus wrote\r\nten cubits also.]\r\n\r\n\r\n9 (return) [ As for these two famous pillars, Jachin and Booz, their\r\nheight could be no more than eighteen cubits, as here, and 1 Kings 7:15;\r\n2 Kings 25:17; Jeremiah 3:21; those thirty-five cubits in 2 Chronicles\r\n3:15, being contrary to all the rules of architecture in the world.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10 (return) [ The round or cylindrical lavers of four cubits in\r\ndiameter, and four in height, both in our copies, 1 Kings 7:38, 39, and\r\nhere in Josephus, must have contained a great deal more than these forty\r\nbaths, which are always assigned them. Where the error lies is hard to\r\nsay: perhaps Josephus honestly followed his copies here, though they had\r\nbeen corrupted, and he was not able to restore the true reading. In the\r\nmean time, the forty baths are probably the true quantity contained in\r\neach laver, since they went upon wheels, and were to be drawn by the\r\nLevites about the courts of the priests for the washings they were\r\ndesigned for; and had they held much more, they would have been too\r\nheavy to have been so drawn.]\r\n\r\n\r\n11 (return) [ Here Josephus gives us a key to his own language, of right\r\nand left hand in the tabernacle and temple; that by the right hand he\r\nmeans what is against our left, when we suppose ourselves going up from\r\nthe east gate of the courts towards the tabernacle or temple themselves,\r\nand so vice versa; whence it follows, that the pillar Jachin, on the\r\nright hand of the temple was on the south, against our left hand; and\r\nBooz on the north, against our right hand.

The Septuagint say that \"they prepared\r\ntimber and stones to build the temple for three years,\" 1 Kings 5:18;\r\nand although neither our present Hebrew copy, nor Josephus, directly\r\nname that number of years, yet do they both say the building itself did\r\nnot begin till Solomon's fourth year; and both speak of the preparation\r\nof materials beforehand, 1 Kings v. 18; Antiq.

VIII. ch. 5. sect. 1.\r\nThere is no reason, therefore, to alter the Septuagint's number; but we\r\nare to suppose three years to have been the just time of the\r\npreparation, as I have done in my computation of the expense in building\r\nthat temple.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13 (return) [ This solemn removal of the ark from Mount Sion to Mount\r\nMoriah, at the distance of almost three quarters of a mile, confutes\r\nthat notion of the modern Jews, and followed by many Christians also, as\r\nif those two were after a sort one and the same mountain, for which\r\nthere is, I think, very little foundation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14 (return) [ This mention of the Corinthian ornaments of architecture\r\nin Solomon's palace by Josephus seems to be here set down by way of\r\nprophecy although it appears to me that the Grecian and Roman most\r\nancient orders of architecture were taken from Solomon's temple, as from\r\ntheir original patterns, yet it is not so clear that the last and most\r\nornamental order of the Corinthian was so ancient, although what the\r\nsame Josephus says, [Of the War, B. V. ch. 5. sect. 3,] that one of the\r\ngates of Herod's temple was built according to the rules of this\r\nCorinthian order, is no way improbable, that order being, without\r\ndispute, much older than the reign of Herod. However, upon some trial, I\r\nconfess I have not hitherto been able fully to understand the structure\r\nof this palace of Solomon, either as described in our Bibles, or even\r\nwith the additional help of this description here by Josephus; only the\r\nreader may easily observe with me, that the measures of this first\r\nbuilding in Josephus, a hundred cubits long, and fifty cubits broad, are\r\nthe very same with the area of the cart of the tabernacle of Moses, and\r\njust hall' an Egyptian orout, or acre.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15 (return) [ This signification of the name Pharaoh appears to be true.\r\nBut what Josephus adds presently, that no king of Egypt was called\r\nPharaoh after Solomon's father-in-law, does hardly agree to our copies,\r\nwhich have long afterwards the names of Pharaoh Neehob, and Pharaoh\r\nHophrah, 2 Kings 23:29; Jeremiah 44:30, besides the frequent mention of\r\nthat name Pharaoh in the prophets. However, Josephus himself, in his own\r\nspeech to the Jews, Of the War, B. V. ch. 9. sect. 4, speaks of Neehao,\r\nwho was also called Pharaoh, as the name of that king of Egypt with whom\r\nAbraham was concerned; of which name Neehao yet we have elsewhere no\r\nmention till the days of Josiah, but only of Pharaoh. And, indeed, it\r\nmust be conceded, that here, and sect. 5, we have more mistakes made by\r\nJosephus, and those relating to the kings of Egypt, and to that queen of\r\nEgypt and Ethiopia, whom he supposes to have come to see Solomon, than\r\nalmost any where else in all his Antiquities.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 (return) [ That this queen of Sheba was a queen of Sabea in South\r\nArabia, and not of Egypt and Ethiopia, as Josephus here asserts, is, I\r\nsuppose, now generally agreed. And since Sabea is well known to be a\r\ncountry near the sea in the south of Arabia Felix, which lay south from\r\nJudea also; and since our Savior calls this queen, \"the queen of the\r\nsouth,\" and says, \"she came from the utmost parts of the earth,\" Matthew\r\n12:42; Luke 11:31, which descriptions agree better to this Arabia than\r\nto Egypt and Ethiopia; there is little occasion for doubting in this\r\nmatter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n17 (return) [ Some blame Josephus for supposing that the balsam tree\r\nmight be first brought out of Arabia, or Egypt, or Ethiopia, into Judea,\r\nby this queen of Sheba, since several have said that of old no country\r\nbore this precious balsam but Judea; yet it is not only false that this\r\nbalsam was peculiar to Judea but both Egypt and Arabia, and particularly\r\nSabea; had it; which last was that very country whence Josephus, if\r\nunderstood not of Ethiopia, but of Arabia, intimates this queen might\r\nbring it first into Judea. Nor are we to suppose that the queen of\r\nSabaea could well omit such a present as this balsam tree would be\r\nesteemed by Solomon, in case it were then almost peculiar to her own\r\ncountry. Nor is the mention of balm or balsam, as carried by merchants,\r\nand sent as a present out of Judea by Jacob, to the governor of Egypt,\r\nGenesis 37:25; 43:11, to be alleged to the contrary, since what we there\r\nrender balm or balsam, denotes rather that turpentine which we now call\r\nturpentine of Chio, or Cyprus, the juice of the turpentine tree, than\r\nthis precious balm. This last is also the same word that we elsewhere\r\nrender by the same mistake balm of Gilead; it should be rendered, the\r\nturpentine of Gilead, Jeremiah 8:22.]\r\n\r\n\r\n18 (return) [ Whether these fine gardens and rivulets of Etham, about\r\nsix miles from Jerusalem, whither Solomon rode so often in state, be not\r\nthose alluded to, Ecclesiastes 2:5, 6, where he says, \"He made him\r\ngardens and orchards, and planted trees in them of all kinds of fruits:\r\nhe made him pools of water, to water the wood that bringeth forth\r\ntrees;\" and to the finest part whereof he seems to allude, when, in the\r\nCanticles, he compares his spouse to a garden \"enclosed,\" to a \"spring\r\nshut up,\" to a \"fountain sealed,\" ch. 4. 12 [part of which from rains\r\nare still extant, as Mr. Matmdrell informs us, page 87, 88]; cannot now\r\nbe certainly determined, but may very probably be conjectured. But\r\nwhether this Etham has any relation to those rivers of Etham, which\r\nProvidence once dried up in a miraculous manner, Psalm 74:15, in the\r\nSeptuagint, I cannot say.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19 (return) [ These seven hundred wives, or the daughters of great men,\r\nand the three hundred concubines, the daughters of the ignoble, make one\r\nthousand in all; and are, I suppose, those very one thousand women\r\nintimated elsewhere by Solomon himself, when he speaks of his not having\r\nfound one [good] woman among that very number, Ecclesiastes 7:28.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20 (return) [ Josephus is here certainly too severe upon Solomon, who,\r\nin making the cherubims, and these twelve brazen oxen, seems to have\r\ndone no more than imitate the patterns left him by David, which were all\r\ngiven David by Divine inspiration. See my description of the temples,\r\nch. 10. And although God gave no direction for the lions that adorned\r\nhis throne, yet does not Solomon seem therein to have broken any law of\r\nMoses; for although the Pharisees and latter Rabbins have extended the\r\nsecond commandment, to forbid the very making of any image, though\r\nwithout any intention to have it worshipped, yet do not I suppose that\r\nSolomon so understood it, nor that it ought to be so understood. The\r\nmaking any other altar for worship but that at the tabernacle was\r\nequally forbidden by Moses, Antiq. B. IV. ch. 8. sect. 5; yet did not\r\nthe two tribes and a half offend when they made an altar for a memorial\r\nonly, Joshua 22; Antiq. B. V. ch. 1. sect. 26, 27.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21 (return) [ Since the beginning of Solomon's evil life and adversity\r\nwas the time when Hadad or Ader, who was born at least twenty or thirty\r\nyears before Solomon came to the crown, in the days of David, began to\r\ngive him disturbance, this implies that Solomon's evil life began early,\r\nand continued very long, which the multitude of his wives and concubines\r\ndoes imply also; I suppose when he was not fifty years of age.]\r\n\r\n\r\n22 (return) [ This youth of Jeroboam, when Solomon built the walls of\r\nrighteous and keep the laws, because he hath proposed to thee the\r\ngreatest of all rewards for thy piety, and the honor thou shalt pay to\r\nGod, namely, to be as greatly exalted as thou knowest David to have\r\nbeen.\" Jerusalem, not very long after he had finished his twenty years\r\nbuilding of the temple and his own palace, or not very long after the\r\ntwenty-fourth of his reign, 1 Kings 9:24; 2 Chronicles 8:11, and his\r\nyouth here still mentioned, when Solomon's wickedness was become\r\nintolerable, fully confirm my former observation, that such his\r\nwickedness began early, and continued very long. See Ecclus. 47:14.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23 (return) [ That by scorpions is not here meant that small animal so\r\ncalled, which was never used in corrections, but either a shrub, furze\r\nbush, or else some terrible sort of whip of the like nature see Hudson's\r\nand Spanheim's notes here.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24 (return) [ Whether these \"fountains of the Lesser Jordan\" were near a\r\nplace called Dan, and the fountains of the Greater near a place called\r\nJor, before their conjunction; or whether there was only one fountain,\r\narising at the lake Phiala, at first sinking under ground, and then\r\narising near the mountain Paneum, and thence running through the lake\r\nScmochonitis to the Sea of Galilee, and so far called the Lesser Jordan;\r\nis hardly certain, even in Josephus himself, though the latter account\r\nbe the most probable. However, the northern idolatrous calf, set up by\r\nJeroboam, was where Little Jordan fell into Great Jordan, near a place\r\ncalled Daphnae, as Josephus elsewhere informs us, Of the War, B. IV. ch.\r\n1. sect. 1: see the note there.]\r\n\r\n\r\n25 (return) [ How much a larger and better copy Josephus had in this\r\nremarkable history of the true prophet of Judea, and his concern with\r\nJeroboam, and with the false prophet of Bethel, than our other copies\r\nhave, is evident at first sight. The prophet's very name, Jadon, or, as\r\nthe Constitutions call him, Adonias, is wanting in our other copies; and\r\nit is there, with no little absurdity, said that God revealed Jadon the\r\ntrue prophet's death, not to himself as here, but to the false prophet.\r\nWhether the particular account of the arguments made use of, after all,\r\nby the false prophet against his own belief and his own conscience, in\r\norder to persuade Jeroboam to persevere in his idolatry and wickedness,\r\nthan which more plausible could not be invented, was intimated in\r\nJosephus's copy, or in some other ancient book, cannot now be\r\ndetermined; our other copies say not one word of it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n26 (return) [ That this Shishak was not the same person with the famous\r\nSesostris, as some have very lately, in contradiction to all antiquity,\r\nsupposed, and that our Josephus did not take him to be the same, as they\r\npretend, but that Sesostris was many centuries earlier than Shishak, see\r\nAuthent. Records, part II. page 1024.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27 (return) [ Herodotus, as here quoted by Josephus, and as this passage\r\nstill stands in his present copies, B. II. ch. 14., affirms, that \"the\r\nPhoenicians and Syrians in Palestine [which last are generally supposed\r\nto denote the Jews] owned their receiving circumcision from the\r\nEgyptians;\" whereas it is abundantly evident that the Jews received\r\ntheir circumcision from the patriarch Abraham, Genesis 17:9-14; John\r\n7:22, 23, as I conclude the Egyptian priests themselves did also. It is\r\nnot therefore very unlikely that Herodotus, because the Jews had lived\r\nlong in Egypt, and came out of it circumcised, did thereupon think they\r\nhad learned that circumcision in Egypt, and had it not broke. Manetho,\r\nthe famous Egyptian chronologer and historian, who knew the history of\r\nhis own country much better than Herodotus, complains frequently of his\r\nmistakes about their affairs, as does Josephus more than once in this\r\nchapter. Nor indeed does Herodotus seem at all acquainted with the\r\naffairs of the Jews; for as he never names them, so little or nothing of\r\nwhat he says about them, their country, or maritime cities, two of which\r\nhe alone mentions, Cadytus and Jenysus, proves true; nor indeed do there\r\nappear to have ever been any such cities on their coast.]\r\n\r\n\r\n28 (return) [ This is a strange expression in Josephus, that God is his\r\nown workmanship, or that he made himself, contrary to common sense and\r\nto catholic Christianity; perhaps he only means that he was not made by\r\none, but was unoriginated.]\r\n\r\n\r\n29 (return) [ By this terrible and perfectly unparalleled slaughter of\r\nfive hundred thousand men of the newly idolatrous and rebellious ten\r\ntribes, God's high displeasure and indignation against that idolatry and\r\nrebellion fully appeared; the remainder were thereby seriously cautioned\r\nnot to persist in them, and a kind of balance or equilibrium was made\r\nbetween the ten and the two tribes for the time to come; while otherwise\r\nthe perpetually idolatrous and rebellious ten tribes would naturally\r\nhave been too powerful for the two tribes, which were pretty frequently\r\nfree both from such idolatry and rebellion; nor is there any reason to\r\ndoubt of the truth of the prodigious number upmost: signal an occasion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n30 (return) [ The reader is to remember that Cush is not Ethiopia, but\r\nArabia.

This may be that city so denominated from\r\nAbel the righteous, there buried, concerning the shedding of whose blood\r\nwithin the compass of the land of Israel, I understand our Savior's\r\nwords about the fatal war and overthrow of Judea by Titus and his Roman\r\narmy; \"That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the\r\nland, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of\r\nBarnchins, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.

Josephus here seems\r\nto mean, that this drought affected all the habitable earth, and\r\npresently all the earth, as our Savior says it was upon all the earth,\r\nLuke 4:25.

II. ch. 15. sect. 1. See the like of David, 2\r\nSamuel 15:30; Antiq. B. VII. ch. 9. sect. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n37 (return) [ Mr. Reland notes here very truly, that the word naked does\r\nnot always signify entirely naked, but sometimes without men's usual\r\narmor, without heir usual robes or upper garments; as when Virgil bids\r\nthe husbandman plough naked, and sow naked; when Josephus says [Antiq.\r\nB. IV. ch. 3. sect. 2: that God had given the Jews the security of armor\r\nwhen they were naked; and when he here says that Ahab fell on the\r\nSyrians when they were naked and drunk; when [Antiq. B. XI. ch. 5. sect.\r\n8: he says that Nehemiah commanded those Jews that were building the\r\nwalls of Jerusalem to take care to have their armor on upon occasion,\r\nthat the enemy might not fall upon them naked. I may add, that the case\r\nseems to be the same in the Scripture, when it says that Saul lay down\r\nnaked among the prophets, 1 Samuel 19:24; when it says that Isaiah\r\nwalked naked and barefoot, Isaiah 20:2, 3; and when it says that Peter,\r\nbefore he girt his fisher's coat to him, was naked, John 21:7. What is\r\nsaid of David also gives light to this, who was reproached by Michal for\r\n\"dancing before the ark, and uncovering himself in the eyes of his\r\nhandmaids, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself,\" 2\r\nSamuel 6:14, 20; yet it is there expressly said [ver. 14: that \"David\r\nwas girded with a linen ephod,\" i.e. he had laid aside his robes of\r\nstate, and put on the sacerdotal, Levitical, or sacred garments, proper\r\nfor such a solemnity.]\r\n\r\n\r\n38 (return) [ Josephus's number, two myriads and seven thousand, agrees\r\nhere with that in our other copies, as those that were slain by the\r\nfalling down of the walls of Aphek; but I suspected at first that this\r\nnumber in Josephus's present copies could not be his original number,\r\nbecause he calls them \"oligoi,\" a few, which could hardly be said of so\r\nmany as twenty-seven thousand, and because of the improbability of the\r\nfall of a particular wall killing so many; yet when I consider\r\nJosephus's next words, how the rest which were slain in the battle were\r\n\"ten other myriads,\" that twenty-seven thousand are but a few in\r\ncomparison of a hundred thousand, and that it was not \"a wall,\" as in\r\nour English version, but \"the walls\" or \"the entire walls\" of the city\r\nthat fell down, as in all the originals, I lay aside that suspicion, and\r\nfirmly believe that Josephus himself hath, with the rest, given us the\r\njust number, twenty-seven thousand.]\r\n\r\n\r\n39 (return) [ This manner of supplication for men's lives among the\r\nSyrians, with ropes or halters about their heads or necks, is, I\r\nsuppose, no strange thing in later ages, even in our own country.]\r\n\r\n\r\n40 (return) [ It is here remarkable, that in Josephus's copy this\r\nprophet, whose severe denunciation of a disobedient person's slaughter\r\nby a lion had lately come to pass, was no other than Micaiah, the son of\r\nImlah, who, as he now denounced God's judgment on disobedient Ahab,\r\nseems directly to have been that very prophet whom the same Ahab, in 1\r\nKings 22:8, 18, complains of, \"as one whom he hated, because he did not\r\nprophesy good concerning him, but evil,\" and who in that chapter openly\r\nrepeats his denunciations against him; all which came to pass\r\naccordingly; nor is there any reason to doubt but this and the former\r\nwere the very same prophet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n41 (return) [ What is most remarkable in this history, and in many\r\nhistories on other occasions in the Old Testament, is this, that during\r\nthe Jewish theocracy God acted entirely as the supreme King of Israel,\r\nand the supreme General of their armies, and always expected that the\r\nIsraelites should be in such absolute subjection to him, their supreme\r\nand heavenly King, and General of their armies, as subjects and soldiers\r\nare to their earthly kings and generals, and that usually without\r\nknowing the particular reasons of their injunctions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n42 (return) [ These reasonings of Zedekiah the false prophet, in order\r\nto persuade Ahab not to believe Micaiah the true prophet, are plausible;\r\nbut being omitted in our other copies, we cannot now tell whence\r\nJosephus had them, whether from his own temple copy, from some other\r\noriginal author, or from certain ancient notes. That some such plausible\r\nobjection was now raised against Micaiah is very likely, otherwise\r\nJehoshaphat, who used to disbelieve all such false prophets, could never\r\nhave been induced to accompany Ahab in these desperate circumstances.]\r\n\r\n\r\n43 (return) [ This reading of Josephus, that Jehoshaphat put on not his\r\nown, but Ahab's robes, in order to appear to be Ahab, while Ahab was\r\nwithout any robes at all, and hoped thereby to escape his own evil fate,\r\nand disprove Micaiah's prophecy against him, is exceeding probable. It\r\ngives great light also to this whole history; and shows, that although\r\nAhab hoped Jehoshaphat would be mistaken for him, and run the only risk\r\nof being slain in the battle, yet he was entirely disappointed, while\r\nstill the escape of the good man Jehoshaphat, and the slaughter of the\r\nbad man Ahab, demonstrated the great distinction that Divine providence\r\nmade betwixt them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n44 (return) [ We have here a very wise reflection of Josephus about\r\nDivine Providence, and what is derived from it, prophecy, and the\r\ninevitable certainty of its accomplishment; and that when wicked men\r\nthink they take proper methods to elude what is denounced against them,\r\nand to escape the Divine judgments thereby threatened them, without\r\nrepentance, they are ever by Providence infatuated to bring about their\r\nown destruction, and thereby withal to demonstrate the perfect veracity\r\nof that God whose predictions they in vain endeavored to elude.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX. Containing The Interval Of One Hundred And Fifty-Seven\r\nYears.—From The Death Of Ahab To The Captivity Of The Ten Tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. Concerning Jehoshaphat Again; How He Constituted Judges And,\r\nBy God's Assistance Overcame His Enemies.\r\n\r\n1. When Jehoshaphat the king was come to Jerusalem, from the assistance\r\nhe had afforded Ahab, the king of Israel, when he fought with Benhadad,\r\nking of Syria, the prophet Jehu met him, and accused him for assisting\r\nAhab, a man both impious and wicked; and said to him, that God was\r\ndispleased with him for so doing, but that he delivered him from the\r\nenemy, notwithstanding he had sinned, because of his own proper\r\ndisposition, which was good. Whereupon the king betook himself to\r\nthanksgivings and sacrifices to God; after which he presently went over\r\nall that country which he ruled round about, and taught the people, as\r\nwell the laws which God gave them by Moses, as that religious worship\r\nthat was due to him. He also constituted judges in every one of the\r\ncities of his kingdom; and charged them to have regard to nothing so\r\nmuch in judging the multitude as to do justice, and not to be moved by\r\nbribes, nor by the dignity of men eminent for either their riches or\r\ntheir high birth, but to distribute justice equally to all, as knowing\r\nthat God is conscious of every secret action of theirs. When he had\r\nhimself instructed them thus, and gone over every city of the two\r\ntribes, he returned to Jerusalem. He there also constituted judges out\r\nof the priests and the Levites, and principal persons of the multitude,\r\nand admonished them to pass all their sentences with care and justice 1\r\nAnd that if any of the people of his country had differences of great\r\nconsequence, they should send them out of the other cities to these\r\njudges, who would be obliged to give righteous sentences concerning such\r\ncauses; and this with the greater care, because it is proper that the\r\nsentences which are given in that city wherein the temple of God is, and\r\nwherein the king dwells, be given with great care and the utmost\r\njustice. Now he set over them Amariah the priest, and Zebadiah, [both]\r\nof the tribe of Judah; and after this manner it was that the king\r\nordered these affairs.\r\n\r\n2. About the same time the Moabites and Ammonites made an expedition\r\nagainst Jehoshaphat, and took with them a great body of Arabians, and\r\npitched their camp at Engedi, a city that is situate at the lake\r\nAsphaltiris, and distant three hundred furlongs from Jerusalem. In that\r\nplace grows the best kind of palm trees, and the opobalsamum. 2 Now\r\nJehoshaphat heard that the enemies had passed over the lake, and had\r\nmade an irruption into that country which belonged to his kingdom; at\r\nwhich news he was affrighted, and called the people of Jerusalem to a\r\ncongregation in the temple, and standing over against the temple itself,\r\nhe called upon God to afford him power and strength, so as to inflict\r\npunishment on those that made this expedition against them [for that\r\nthose who built this his temple had prayed, that he would protect that\r\ncity, and take vengeance on those that were so bold as to come against\r\nit]; for they are come to take from us that land which thou hast given\r\nus for a possession. When he had prayed thus, he fell into tears; and\r\nthe whole multitude, together with their wives and children, made their\r\nsupplications also: upon which a certain prophet, Jahaziel by name, came\r\ninto the midst of the assembly, and cried out, and spake both to the\r\nmultitude and to the king, that God heard their prayers, and promised to\r\nfight against their enemies. He also gave order that the king should\r\ndraw his forces out the next day, for that he should find them between\r\nJerusalem and the ascent of Engedi, at a place called The Eminence, and\r\nthat he should not fight against them, but only stand still, and see how\r\nGod would fight against them. When the prophet had said this, both the\r\nking and the multitude fell upon their faces, and gave thanks to God,\r\nand worshipped him; and the Levites continued singing hymns to God with\r\ntheir instruments of music.\r\n\r\n3. As soon as it was day, and the king was come into that wilderness\r\nwhich is under the city of Tekoa, he said to the multitude, \"that they\r\nought to give credit to what the prophet had said, and not to set\r\nthemselves in array for fighting; but to set the priests with their\r\ntrumpets, and the Levites with the singers of hymns, to give thanks to\r\nGod, as having already delivered our country from our enemies.\" This\r\nopinion of the king pleased [the people], and they did what he advised\r\nthem to do. So God caused a terror and a commotion to arise among the\r\nAmmonites, who thought one another to be enemies, and slew one another,\r\ninsomuch that not one man out of so great an army escaped; and when\r\nJehoshaphat looked upon that valley wherein their enemies had been\r\nencamped, and saw it full of dead men, he rejoiced at so surprising an\r\nevent, as was this assistance of God, while he himself by his own power,\r\nand without their labor, had given them the victory. He also gave his\r\narmy leave to take the prey of the enemy's camp, and to spoil their dead\r\nbodies; and indeed so they did for three days together, till they were\r\nweary, so great was the number of the slain; and on the fourth day, all\r\nthe people were gathered together unto a certain hollow place or valley,\r\nand blessed God for his power and assistance, from which the place had\r\nthis name given it, the Valley of [Berachah, or] Blessing.\r\n\r\n4. And when the king had brought his army back to Jerusalem, he betook\r\nhimself to celebrate festivals, and offer sacrifices, and this for many\r\ndays. And indeed, after this destruction of their enemies, and when it\r\ncame to the ears of the foreign nations, they were all greatly\r\naffrighted, as supposing that God would openly fight for him hereafter.\r\nSo Jehoshaphat from that time lived in great glory and splendor, on\r\naccount of his righteousness and his piety towards God. He was also in\r\nfriendship with Ahab's son, who was king of Israel; and he joined with\r\nhim in the building of ships that were to sail to Pontus, and the\r\ntraffic cities of Thrace 3 but he failed of his gains, for the ships\r\nwere destroyed by being so great [and unwieldy]; on which account he was\r\nno longer concerned about shipping. And this is the history of\r\nJehoshaphat, the king of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. Concerning Ahaziah; The King Of Israel; And Again Concerning\r\nThe Prophet Elijah.\r\n\r\n1. And now Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, reigned over Israel, and made his\r\nabode in Samaria. He was a wicked man, and in all respects like to both\r\nhis parents and to Jeroboam, who first of all transgressed, and began to\r\ndeceive the people. In the second year of his reign, the king of Moab\r\nfell off from his obedience, and left off paying those tributes which he\r\nbefore paid to his father Ahab. Now it happened that Ahaziah, as he was\r\ncoming down from the top of his house, fell down from it, and in his\r\nsickness sent to the Fly, which was the god of Ekron, for that was this\r\ngod's name, to inquire about his recovery 4 but the God of the Hebrews\r\nappeared to Elijah the prophet, and commanded him to go and meet the\r\nmessengers that were sent, and to ask them, whether the people of Israel\r\nhad not a God of their own, that the king sent to a foreign god to\r\ninquire about his recovery? and to bid them return and tell the king\r\nthat he would not escape this disease. And when Elijah had performed\r\nwhat God had commanded him, and the messengers had heard what he said,\r\nthey returned to the king immediately; and when the king wondered how\r\nthey could return so soon, and asked them the reason of it, they said\r\nthat a certain man met them, and forbade them to go on any farther; but\r\nto return and tell thee, from the command of the God of Israel, that\r\nthis disease will have a bad end. And when the king bid them describe\r\nthe man that said this to them, they replied that he was a hairy man,\r\nand was girt about with a girdle of leather. So the king understood by\r\nthis that the man who was described by the messengers was Elijah;\r\nwhereupon he sent a captain to him, with fifty soldiers, and commanded\r\nthem to bring Elijah to him; and when the captain that was sent found\r\nElijah sitting upon the top of a hill, he commanded him to come down,\r\nand to come to the king, for so had he enjoined; but that in case he\r\nrefused, they would carry him by force. Elijah said to him, \"That you\r\nmay have a trial whether I be a true prophet, I will pray that fire may\r\nfall from heaven, and destroy both the soldiers and yourself.\" 5 So he\r\nprayed, and a whirlwind of fire fell [from heaven], and destroyed the\r\ncaptain, and those that were with him. And when the king was informed of\r\nthe destruction of these men, he was very angry, and sent another\r\ncaptain with the like number of armed men that were sent before. And\r\nwhen this captain also threatened the prophet, that unless he came down\r\nof his own accord, he would take him and carry him away, upon his prayer\r\nagainst him, the fire [from heaven] slew this captain as well the other.\r\nAnd when, upon inquiry, the king was informed of what happened to him,\r\nhe sent out a third captain. But when this captain, who was a wise man,\r\nand of a mild disposition, came to the place where Elijah happened to\r\nbe, and spake civilly to him; and said that he knew that it was without\r\nhis own consent, and only in submission to the king's command that he\r\ncame to him; and that those that came before did not come willingly, but\r\non the same account;—he therefore desired him to have pity on those\r\narmed men that were with him, and that he would come down and follow him\r\nto the king. So Elijah accepted of his discreet words and courteous\r\nbehavior, and came down and followed him. And when he came to the king,\r\nhe prophesied to him and told him that God said, \"Since thou hast\r\ndespised him as not being God, and so unable to foretell the truth about\r\nthy distemper, but hast sent to the god of Ekron to inquire of him what\r\nwill be the end of this thy distemper, know this, that thou shalt die.\"\r\n\r\n2. Accordingly the king in a very little time died, as Elijah had\r\nforetold; but Jehoram his brother succeeded him in the kingdom, for he\r\ndied without children: but for this Jehoram, he was like his father Ahab\r\nin wickedness, and reigned twelve years, indulging himself in all sorts\r\nof wickedness and impiety towards God, for, leaving off his worship, he\r\nworshipped foreign gods; but in other respects he was an active man. Now\r\nat this time it was that Elijah disappeared from among men, and no one\r\nknows of his death to this very day; but he left behind him his disciple\r\nElisha, as we have formerly declared. And indeed, as to Elijah, and as\r\nto Enoch, who was before the deluge, it is written in the sacred books\r\nthat they disappeared, but so that nobody knew that they died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How Joram And Jehoshaphat Made An Expedition Against The\r\nMoabites; As Also Concerning The Wonders Of Elisha; And The Death Of\r\nJehoshaphat.\r\n\r\n1. When Joram had taken upon him the kingdom, he determined to make an\r\nexpedition against the king of Moab, whose name was Mesha; for, as we\r\ntold you before, he was departed from his obedience to his brother\r\n[Ahaziah], while he paid to his father Ahab two hundred thousand sheep,\r\nwith their fleeces of wool. When therefore he had gathered his own army\r\ntogether, he sent also to Jehoshaphat, and entreated him, that since he\r\nhad from the beginning been a friend to his father, he would assist him\r\nin the war that he was entering into against the Moabites, who had\r\ndeparted from their obedience, who not only himself promised to assist\r\nhim, but would also oblige the king of Edom, who was under his\r\nauthority, to make the same expedition also. When Joram had received\r\nthese assurances of assistance from Jehoshaphat, he took his army with\r\nhim, and came to Jerusalem; and when he had been sumptuously entertained\r\nby the king of Jerusalem, it was resolved upon by them to take their\r\nmarch against their enemies through the wilderness of Edom. And when\r\nthey had taken a compass of seven days' journey, they were in distress\r\nfor want of water for the cattle, and for the army, from the mistake of\r\ntheir roads by the guides that conducted them, insomuch that they were\r\nall in an agony, especially Joram; and cried to God, by reason of their\r\nsorrow, and [desired to know] what wickedness had been committed by them\r\nthat induced him to deliver three kings together, without fighting, unto\r\nthe king of Moab. But Jehoshaphat, who was a righteous man, encouraged\r\nhim, and bade him send to the camp, and know whether any prophet of God\r\nwas come along with them, that we might by him learn from God what we\r\nshould do. And when one of the servants of Joram said that he had seen\r\nthere Elisha, the son of Shaphat, the disciple of Elijah, the three\r\nkings went to him, at the entreaty of Jehoshaphat; and when they were\r\ncome at the prophet's tent, which tent was pitched out of the camp, they\r\nasked him what would become of the army? and Joram was particularly very\r\npressing with him about it. And when he replied to him, that he should\r\nnot trouble him, but go to his father's and mother's prophets, for they\r\n[to be sure] were true prophets, he still desired him to prophesy, and\r\nto save them. So he swore by God that he would not answer him, unless it\r\nwere on account of Jehoshaphat, who was a holy and righteous man; and\r\nwhen, at his desire, they brought him a man that could play on the\r\npsaltery, the Divine Spirit came upon him as the music played, and he\r\ncommanded them to dig many trenches in the valley; for, said he, \"though\r\nthere appear neither cloud, nor wind, nor storm of rain, ye shall see\r\nthis river full of water, till the army and the cattle be saved for you\r\nby drinking of it. Nor will this be all the favor that you shall receive\r\nfrom God, but you shall also overcome your enemies, and take the best\r\nand strongest cities of the Moabites, and you shall cut down their fruit\r\ntrees, 6 and lay waste their country, and stop up their fountains and\r\nrivers.\"\r\n\r\n2. When the prophet had said this, the next day, before the sun-rising,\r\na great torrent ran strongly; for God had caused it to rain very\r\nplentifully at the distance of three days' journey into Edom, so that\r\nthe army and the cattle found water to drink in abundance. But when the\r\nMoabites heard that the three kings were coming upon them, and made\r\ntheir approach through the wilderness, the king of Moab gathered his\r\narmy together presently, and commanded them to pitch their camp upon the\r\nmountains, that when the enemies should attempt to enter their country,\r\nthey might not be concealed from them. But when at the rising of the sun\r\nthey saw the water in the torrent, for it was not far from the land of\r\nMoab, and that it was of the color of blood, for at such a time the\r\nwater especially looks red, by the shining of the sun upon it, they\r\nformed a false notion of the state of their enemies, as if they had\r\nslain one another for thirst; and that the river ran with their blood.\r\nHowever, supposing that this was the case, they desired their king would\r\nsend them out to spoil their enemies; whereupon they all went in haste,\r\nas to an advantage already gained, and came to the enemy's camp, as\r\nsupposing them destroyed already. But their hope deceived them; for as\r\ntheir enemies stood round about them, some of them were cut to pieces,\r\nand others of them were dispersed, and fled to their own country. And\r\nwhen the kings fell into the land of Moab, they overthrew the cities\r\nthat were in it, and spoiled their fields, and marred them, filling them\r\nwith stones out of the brooks, and cut down the best of their trees, and\r\nstopped up their fountains of water, and overthrew their walls to their\r\nfoundations. But the king of Moab, when he was pursued, endured a siege;\r\nand seeing his city in danger of being overthrown by force, made a\r\nsally, and went out with seven hundred men, in order to break through\r\nthe enemy's camp with his horsemen, on that side where the watch seemed\r\nto be kept most negligently; and when, upon trial, he could not get\r\naway, for he lighted upon a place that was carefully watched, he\r\nreturned into the city, and did a thing that showed despair and the\r\nutmost distress; for he took his eldest son, who was to reign after him,\r\nand lifting him up upon the wall, that he might be visible to all the\r\nenemies, he offered him as a whole burnt-offering to God, whom, when the\r\nkings saw, they commiserated the distress that was the occasion of it,\r\nand were so affected, in way of humanity and pity, that they raised the\r\nsiege, and every one returned to his own house. So Jehoshaphat came to\r\nJerusalem, and continued in peace there, and outlived this expedition\r\nbut a little time, and then died, having lived in all sixty years, and\r\nof them reigned twenty-five. He was buried in a magnificent manner in\r\nJerusalem, for he had imitated the actions of David.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. Jehoram Succeeds Jehoshaphat; How Joram, His Namesake, King\r\nOf Israel, Fought With The Syrians; And What Wonders Were Done By The\r\nProphet Elisha.\r\n\r\n1. Jehoshapat had a good number of children; but he appointed his eldest\r\nson Jehoram to be his successor, who had the same name with his mother's\r\nbrother, that was king of Israel, and the son of Ahab. Now when the king\r\nof Israel was come out of the land of Moab to Samaria, he had with him\r\nElisha the prophet, whose acts I have a mind to go over particularly,\r\nfor they were illustrious, and worthy to be related, as we have them set\r\ndown in the sacred books.\r\n\r\n2. For they say that the widow of Obadiah 7 Ahab's steward, came to him,\r\nand said, that he was not ignorant how her husband had preserved the\r\nprophets that were to be slain by Jezebel, the wife of Ahab; for she\r\nsaid that he hid a hundred of them, and had borrowed money for their\r\nmaintenance, and that, after her husband's death, she and her children\r\nwere carried away to be made slaves by the creditors; and she desired of\r\nhim to have mercy upon her on account of what her husband did, and\r\nafford her some assistance. And when he asked her what she had in the\r\nhouse, she said, \"Nothing but a very small quantity of oil in a cruse.\"\r\nSo the prophet bid her go away, and borrow a great many empty vessels of\r\nher neighbors, and when she had shut her chamber door, to pour the oil\r\ninto them all; for that God would fill them full. And when the woman had\r\ndone what she was commanded to do, and bade her children bring every one\r\nof the vessels, and all were filled, and not one left empty, she came to\r\nthe prophet, and told him that they were all full; upon which he advised\r\nher to go away, and sell the oil, and pay the creditors what was owing\r\nthem, for that there would be some surplus of the price of the oil,\r\nwhich she might make use of for the maintenance of her children. And\r\nthus did Elisha discharge the woman's debts, and free her from the\r\nvexation of her creditors.\r\n\r\n3. Elisha also sent a hasty message to Joram, 8 and exhorted him to take\r\ncare of that place, for that therein were some Syrians lying in ambush\r\nto kill him. So the king did as the prophet exhorted him, and avoided\r\nhis going a hunting. And when Benhadad missed of the success of his\r\nlying in ambush, he was wroth with his own servants, as if they had\r\nbetrayed his ambushment to Joram; and he sent for them, and said they\r\nwere the betrayers of his secret counsels; and he threatened that he\r\nwould put them to death, since such their practice was evident, because\r\nhe had intrusted this secret to none but them, and yet it was made known\r\nto his enemy. And one that was present said that he should not mistake\r\nhimself, nor suspect that they had discovered to his enemy his sending\r\nmen to kill him, but that he ought to know that it was Elisha the\r\nprophet who discovered all to him, and laid open all his counsels. So he\r\ngave order that they should send some to learn in what city Elisha\r\ndwelt. Accordingly those that were sent brought word that he was in\r\nDothan; wherefore Benhadad sent to that city a great army, with horses\r\nand chariots, to take Elisha: so they encompassed the city round about\r\nby night, and kept him therein confined; but when the prophet's servant\r\nin the morning perceived this, and that his enemies sought to take\r\nElisha, he came running, and crying out after a disordered manner to\r\nhim, and told him of it; but he encouraged him, and bid him not be\r\nafraid, and to despise the enemy, and trust in the assistance of God,\r\nand was himself without fear; and he besought God to make manifest to\r\nhis servant his power and presence, so far as was possible, in order to\r\nthe inspiring him with hope and courage. Accordingly God heard the\r\nprayer of the prophet, and made the servant see a multitude of chariots\r\nand horses encompassing Elisha, till he laid aside his fear, and his\r\ncourage revived at the sight of what he supposed was come to their\r\nassistance. After this Elisha did further entreat God, that he would dim\r\nthe eyes of their enemies, and cast a mist before them, whereby they\r\nmight not discern him. When this was done, he went into the midst of his\r\nenemies, and asked them who it was that they came to seek; and when they\r\nreplied, \"The prophet Elisha,\" he promised he would deliver him to them,\r\nif they would follow him to the city where he was. So these men were so\r\ndarkened by God in their sight and in their mind, that they followed him\r\nvery diligently; and when Elisha had brought them to Samaria, he ordered\r\nJoram the king to shut the gates, and to place his own army round about\r\nthem; and prayed to God to clear the eyes of these their enemies, and\r\ntake the mist from before them. Accordingly, when they were freed from\r\nthe obscurity they had been in, they saw themselves in the midst of\r\ntheir enemies; and as the Syrians were strangely amazed and distressed,\r\nas was but reasonable, at an action so Divine and surprising, and as\r\nking Joram asked the prophet if he would give him leave to shoot at\r\nthem, Elisha forbade him so to do; and said, that \"it is just to kill\r\nthose that are taken in battle, but that these men had done the country\r\nno harm, but, without knowing it, were come thither by the Divine\r\nPower:\"—so that his counsel was to treat them in a hospitable manner at\r\nhis table, and then send them away without hurting them. 9 Wherefore\r\nJoram obeyed the prophet; and when he had feasted the Syrians in a\r\nsplendid and magnificent manner, he let them go to Benhadad their king.\r\n\r\n4. Now when these men were come back, and had showed Benhadad how\r\nstrange an accident had befallen them, and what an appearance and power\r\nthey had experienced of the God of Israel, he wondered at it, as also at\r\nthat prophet with whom God was so evidently present; so he determined to\r\nmake no more secret attempts upon the king of Israel, out of fear of\r\nElisha, but resolved to make open war with them, as supposing he could\r\nbe too hard for his enemies by the multitude of his army and power. So\r\nhe made an expedition with a great army against Joram, who, not thinking\r\nhimself a match for him, shut himself up in Samaria, and depended on the\r\nstrength of its walls; but Benhadad supposed he should take the city, if\r\nnot by his engines of war, yet that he should overcome the Samaritans by\r\nfamine, and the want of necessaries, and brought his army upon them, and\r\nbesieged the city; and the plenty of necessaries was brought so low with\r\nJoram, that from the extremity of want an ass's head was sold in Samaria\r\nfor fourscore pieces of silver, and the Hebrews bought a sextary of\r\ndore's dung, instead of salt, for five pieces of silver. Now Joram was\r\nin fear lest somebody should betray the city to the enemy, by reason of\r\nthe famine, and went every day round the walls and the guards to see\r\nwhether any such were concealed among them; and by being thus seen, and\r\ntaking such care, he deprived them of the opportunity of contriving any\r\nsuch thing; and if they had a mind to do it, he, by this means,\r\nprevented them: but upon a certain woman's crying out, \"Have pity on me,\r\nmy lord,\" while he thought that she was about to ask for somewhat to\r\neat, he imprecated God's curse upon her, and said he had neither\r\nthrashing-floor nor wine-press, whence he might give her any thing at\r\nher petition. Upon which she said she did not desire his aid in any such\r\nthing, nor trouble him about food, but desired that he would do her\r\njustice as to another woman. And when he bade her say on, and let him\r\nknow what she desired, she said she had made an agreement with the other\r\nwoman who was her neighbor and her friend, that because the famine and\r\nwant was intolerable, they should kill their children, each of them\r\nhaving a son of their own, \"and we will live upon them ourselves for two\r\ndays, the one day upon one son, and the other day upon the other; and,\"\r\nsaid she, \"I have killed my son the first day, and we lived upon my son\r\nyesterday; but this other woman will not do the same thing, but hath\r\nbroken her agreement, and hath hid her son.\" This story mightily grieved\r\nJoram when he heard it; so he rent his garment, and cried out with a\r\nloud voice, and conceived great wrath against Elisha the prophet, and\r\nset himself eagerly to have him slain, because he did not pray to God to\r\nprovide them some exit and way of escape out of the miseries with which\r\nthey were surrounded; and sent one away immediately to cut off his head,\r\nwho made haste to kill the prophet. But Elisha was not unacquainted with\r\nthe wrath of the king against him; for as he sat in his house by\r\nhimself, with none but his disciples about him, he told them that Joram,\r\n10 who was the son of a murderer, had sent one to take away his head;\r\n\"but,\" said he, \"when he that is commanded to do this comes, take care\r\nthat you do not let him come in, but press the door against him, and\r\nhold him fast there, for the king himself will follow him, and come to\r\nme, having altered his mind.\" Accordingly, they did as they were bidden,\r\nwhen he that was sent by the king to kill Elisha came. But Joram\r\nrepented of his wrath against the prophet; and for fear he that was\r\ncommanded to kill him should have done it before he came, he made haste\r\nto hinder his slaughter, and to save the prophet: and when he came to\r\nhim, he accused him that he did not pray to God for their deliverance\r\nfrom the miseries they now lay under, but saw them so sadly destroyed by\r\nthem. Hereupon Elisha promised, that the very next day, at the very same\r\nhour in which the king came to him, they should have great plenty of\r\nfood, and that two seahs of barley should be sold in the market for a\r\nshekel, and a seah of fine flour should be sold for a shekel. This\r\nprediction made Joram, and those that were present, very joyful, for\r\nthey did not scruple believing what the prophet said, on account of the\r\nexperience they had of the truth of his former predictions; and the\r\nexpectation of plenty made the want they were in that day, with the\r\nuneasiness that accompanied it, appear a light thing to them: but the\r\ncaptain of the third band, who was a friend of the king, and on whose\r\nhand the king leaned, said, \"Thou talkest of incredible things, O\r\nprophet! for as it is impossible for God to pour down torrents of\r\nbarley, or fine flour, out of heaven, so is it impossible that what thou\r\nsayest should come to pass.\" To which the prophet made this reply,\" Thou\r\nshalt see these things come to pass, but thou shalt not be in the least\r\na partaker of them.\"\r\n\r\n5. Now what Elisha had thus foretold came to pass in the manner\r\nfollowing: There was a law at Samaria 11 that those that had the\r\nleprosy, and whose bodies were not cleansed from it, should abide\r\nwithout the city: and there were four men that on this account abode\r\nbefore the gates, while nobody gave them any food, by reason of the\r\nextremity of the famine; and as they were prohibited from entering into\r\nthe city by the law, and they considered that if they were permitted to\r\nenter, they should miserably perish by the famine; as also, that if they\r\nstaid where they were, they should suffer in the same manner,—they\r\nresolved to deliver themselves up to the enemy, that in case they should\r\nspare them, they should live; but if they should be killed, that would\r\nbe an easy death. So when they had confirmed this their resolution, they\r\ncame by night to the enemy's camp. Now God had begun to affright and\r\ndisturb the Syrians, and to bring the noise of chariots and armor to\r\ntheir ears, as though an army were coming upon them, and had made them\r\nsuspect that it was coming nearer and nearer to them In short, they were\r\nin such a dread of this army, that they left their tents, and ran\r\ntogether to Benhadad, and said that Joram the king of Israel had hired\r\nfor auxiliaries both the king of Egypt and the king of the Islands, and\r\nled them against them for they heard the noise of them as they were\r\ncoming. And Benhadad believed what they said [for there came the same\r\nnoise to his ears as well as it did to theirs]; so they fell into a\r\nmighty disorder and tumult, and left their horses and beasts in their\r\ncamp, with immense riches also, and betook themselves to flight. And\r\nthose lepers who had departed from Samaria, and were gone to the camp of\r\nthe Syrians, of whom we made mention a little before, when they were in\r\nthe camp, saw nothing but great quietness and silence: accordingly they\r\nentered into it, and went hastily into one of their tents; and when they\r\nsaw nobody there, they eat and drank, and carried garments, and a great\r\nquantity of gold, and hid it out of the camp; after which they went into\r\nanother tent, and carried off what was in it, as they did at the former,\r\nand this did they for several times, without the least interruption from\r\nany body. So they gathered thereby that the enemies were departed;\r\nwhereupon they reproached themselves that they did not inform Joram and\r\nthe citizens of it. So they came to the walls of Samaria, and called\r\naloud to the watchmen, and told them in what state the enemies were, as\r\ndid these tell the king's guards, by whose means Joram came to know of\r\nit; who then sent for his friends, and the captains of his host, and\r\nsaid to them, that he suspected that this departure of the king of Syria\r\nwas by way of ambush and treachery, and that, \"out of despair of ruining\r\nyou by famine, when you imagine them to be fled away, you may come out\r\nof the city to spoil their camp, and he may then fall upon you on a\r\nsudden, and may both kill you, and take the city without fighting;\r\nwhence it is that I exhort you to guard the city carefully, and by no\r\nmeans to go out of it, or proudly to despise your enemies, as though\r\nthey were really gone away.\" And when a certain person said that he did\r\nvery well and wisely to admit such a suspicion, but that he still\r\nadvised him to send a couple of horsemen to search all the country as\r\nfar as Jordan, that \"if they were seized by an ambush of the enemy, they\r\nmight be a security to your army, that they may not go out as if they\r\nsuspected nothing, nor undergo the like misfortune; and,\" said he,\r\n\"those horsemen may be numbered among those that have died by the\r\nfamine, supposing they be caught and destroyed by the enemy.\" So the\r\nking was pleased with this opinion, and sent such as might search out\r\nthe truth, who performed their journey over a road that was without any\r\nenemies, but found it full of provisions, and of weapons, that they had\r\ntherefore thrown away, and left behind them, in order to their being\r\nlight and expeditious in their flight. When the king heard this, he sent\r\nout the multitude to take the spoils of the camp; which gains of theirs\r\nwere not of things of small value, but they took a great quantity of\r\ngold, and a great quantity of silver, and flocks of all kinds of cattle.\r\nThey also possessed themselves of [so many] ten thousand measures of\r\nwheat and barley, as they never in the least dreamed of; and were not\r\nonly freed from their former miseries, but had such plenty, that two\r\nseahs of barley were bought for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a\r\nshekel, according to the prophecy of Elisha. Now a seah is equal to an\r\nItalian modius and a half. The captain of the third band was the only\r\nman that received no benefit by this plenty; for as he was appointed by\r\nthe king to oversee the gate, that he might prevent the too great crowd\r\nof the multitude, and they might not endanger one another to perish, by\r\ntreading on one another in the press, he suffered himself in that very\r\nway, and died in that very manner, as Elisha had foretold such his\r\ndeath, when he alone of them all disbelieved what he said concerning\r\nthat plenty of provisions which they should soon have.\r\n\r\n6. Hereupon, when Benhadad, the king of Syria, had escaped to Damascus,\r\nand understood that it was God himself that cast all his army into this\r\nfear and disorder, and that it did not arise from the invasion of\r\nenemies, he was mightily cast down at his having God so greatly for his\r\nenemy, and fell into a distemper. Now it happened that Elisha the\r\nprophet, at that time, was gone out of his own country to Damascus, of\r\nwhich Benhadad was informed: he sent Hazael, the most faithful of all\r\nhis servants, to meet him, and to carry him presents, and bade him\r\ninquire of him about his distemper, and whether he should escape the\r\ndanger that it threatened. So Hazael came to Elisha with forty camels,\r\nthat carried the best and most precious fruits that the country of\r\nDamascus afforded, as well as those which the king's palace supplied. He\r\nsaluted him kindly, and said that he was sent to him by king Benhadad,\r\nand brought presents with him, in order to inquire concerning his\r\ndistemper, whether he should recover from it or not. Whereupon the\r\nprophet bid him tell the king no melancholy news; but still he said he\r\nwould die. So the king's servant was troubled to hear it; and Elisha\r\nwept also, and his tears ran down plenteously at his foresight of what\r\nmiseries his people would undergo after the death of Benhadad. And when\r\nHazael asked him what was the occasion of this confusion he was in, he\r\nsaid that he wept out of his commiseration for the multitude of the\r\nIsraelites, and what terrible miseries they will suffer by thee; \"for\r\nthou wilt slay the strongest of them, and wilt burn their strongest\r\ncities, and wilt destroy their children, and dash them against the\r\nstones, and wilt rip up their women with child.\" And when Hazael said,\r\n\"How can it be that I should have power enough to do such things?\" the\r\nprophet replied, that God had informed him that he should be king of\r\nSyria. So when Hazael was come to Benhadad, he told him good news\r\nconcerning his distemper 12 but on the next day he spread a wet cloth,\r\nin the nature of a net, over him, and strangled him, and took his\r\ndominion. He was an active man, and had the good-will of the Syrians,\r\nand of the people of Damascus, to a great degree; by whom both Benhadad\r\nhimself, and Hazael, who ruled after him, are honored to this day as\r\ngods, by reason of their benefactions, and their building them temples\r\nby which they adorned the city of the Damascenes. They also every day do\r\nwith great pomp pay their worship to these kings, 13 and value\r\nthemselves upon their antiquity; nor do they know that these kings are\r\nmuch later than they imagine, and that they are not yet eleven hundred\r\nyears old. Now when Joram, the king of Israel, heard that Benhadad was\r\ndead, he recovered out of the terror and dread he had been in on his\r\naccount, and was very glad to live in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. Concerning The Wickedness Of Jehoram King Of Jerusalem; His\r\nDefeat And Death.\r\n\r\n1. Now Jehoram the king of Jerusalem, for we have said before that he\r\nhad the same name with the king of Israel, as soon as he had taken the\r\ngovernment upon him, betook himself to the slaughter of his brethren,\r\nand his father's friends, who were governors under him, and thence made\r\na beginning and a demonstration of his wickedness; nor was he at all\r\nbetter than those kings of Israel who at first transgressed against the\r\nlaws of their country, and of the Hebrews, and against God's worship.\r\nAnd it was Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab, whom he had married, who\r\ntaught him to be a bad man in other respects, and also to worship\r\nforeign gods. Now God would not quite root out this family, because of\r\nthe promise he had made to David. However, Jehoram did not leave off the\r\nintroduction of new sorts of customs to the propagation of impiety, and\r\nto the ruin of the customs of his own country. And when the Edomites\r\nabout that time had revolted from him, and slain their former king, who\r\nwas in subjection to his father, and had set up one of their own\r\nchoosing, Jehoram fell upon the land of Edom, with the horsemen that\r\nwere about him, and the chariots, by night, and destroyed those that lay\r\nnear to his own kingdom, but did not proceed further. However, this\r\nexpedition did him no service, for they all revolted from him, with\r\nthose that dwelt in the country of Libnah. He was indeed so mad as to\r\ncompel the people to go up to the high places of the mountains, and\r\nworship foreign gods.\r\n\r\n2. As he was doing this, and had entirely cast his own country laws out\r\nof his mind, there was brought him an epistle from Elijah the prophet 14\r\nwhich declared that God would execute great judgments upon him, because\r\nhe had not imitated his own fathers, but had followed the wicked courses\r\nof the kings of Israel; and had compelled the tribe of Judah, and the\r\ncitizens of Jerusalem, to leave the holy worship of their own God, and\r\nto worship idols, as Ahab had compelled the Israelites to do, and\r\nbecause he had slain his brethren, and the men that were good and\r\nrighteous. And the prophet gave him notice in this epistle what\r\npunishment he should undergo for these crimes, namely, the destruction\r\nof his people, with the corruption of the king's own wives and children;\r\nand that he should himself die of a distemper in his bowels, with long\r\ntorments, those his bowels falling out by the violence of the inward\r\nrottenness of the parts, insomuch that, though he see his own misery, he\r\nshall not be able at all to help himself, but shall die in that manner.\r\nThis it was which Elijah denounced to him in that epistle.\r\n\r\n3. It was not long after this that an army of those Arabians that lived\r\nnear to Ethiopia, and of the Philistines, fell upon the kingdom of\r\nJehoram, and spoiled the country and the king's house. Moreover, they\r\nslew his sons and his wives: one only of his sons was left him, who\r\nescaped the enemy; his name was Ahaziah; after which calamity, he\r\nhimself fell into that disease which was foretold by the prophet, and\r\nlasted a great while, [for God inflicted this punishment upon him in his\r\nbelly, out of his wrath against him,] and so he died miserably, and saw\r\nhis own bowels fall out. The people also abused his dead body; I suppose\r\nit was because they thought that such his death came upon him by the\r\nwrath of God, and that therefore he was not worthy to partake of such a\r\nfuneral as became kings. Accordingly, they neither buried him in the\r\nsepulchers of his fathers, nor vouchsafed him any honors, but buried him\r\nlike a private man, and this when he had lived forty years, and reigned\r\neight. And the people of Jerusalem delivered the government to his son\r\nAhaziah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How Jehu Was Anointed King, And Slew Both Joram And Ahaziah;\r\nAs Also What He Did For The Punishment Of The Wicked.\r\n\r\n1. Now Joram, the king of Israel, after the death of Benhadad, hoped\r\nthat he might now take Ramoth, a city of Gilead, from the Syrians.\r\nAccordingly he made an expedition against it, with a great army; but as\r\nhe was besieging it, an arrow was shot at him by one of the Syrians, but\r\nthe wound was not mortal. So he returned to have his wound healed in\r\nJezreel, but left his whole army in Ramoth, and Jehu, the son of Nimshi,\r\nfor their general; for he had already taken the city by force; and he\r\nproposed, after he was healed, to make war with the Syrians; but Elisha\r\nthe prophet sent one of his disciples to Ramoth, and gave him holy oil\r\nto anoint Jehu, and to tell him that God had chosen him to be their\r\nking. He also sent him to say other things to him, and bid him to take\r\nhis journey as if he fled, that when he came away he might escape the\r\nknowledge of all men. So when he was come to the city, he found Jehu\r\nsitting in the midst of the captains of the army, as Elisha had foretold\r\nhe should find him. So he came up to him, and said that he desired to\r\nspeak with him about certain matters; and when he was arisen, and had\r\nfollowed him into an inward chamber, the young man took the oil, and\r\npoured it on his head, and said that God ordained him to be king, in\r\norder to his destroying the house of Ahab, and that he might revenge the\r\nblood of the prophets that were unjustly slain by Jezebel, that so their\r\nhouse might utterly perish, as those of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and\r\nof Baasha, had perished for their wickedness, and no seed might remain\r\nof Ahab's family. So when he had said this, he went away hastily out of\r\nthe chamber, and endeavored not to be seen by any of the army.\r\n\r\n2. But Jehu came out, and went to the place where he before sat with the\r\ncaptains; and when they asked him, and desired him to tell them,\r\nwherefore it was that this young man came to him, and added withal that\r\nhe was mad, he replied,—\"You guess right, for the words he spake were\r\nthe words of a madman;\" and when they were eager about the matter, and\r\ndesired he would tell them, he answered, that God had said he had chosen\r\nhim to be king over the multitude. When he had said this, every one of\r\nthem put off his garment, 15 and strewed it under him, and blew with\r\ntrumpets, and gave notice that Jehu was king. So when he had gotten the\r\narmy together, he was preparing to set out immediately against Joram, at\r\nthe city Jezreel, in which city, as we said before, he was healing of\r\nthe wound which he had received in the siege of Ramoth. It happened also\r\nthat Ahaziah, king of Jerusalem, was now come to Joram, for he was his\r\nsister's son, as we have said already, to see how he did after his\r\nwound, and this upon account of their kindred; but as Jehu was desirous\r\nto fall upon Joram, and those with him, on the sudden, he desired that\r\nnone of the soldiers might run away and tell to Joram what had happened,\r\nfor that this would be an evident demonstration of their kindness to\r\nhim, and would show that their real inclinations were to make him king.\r\n\r\n3. So they were pleased with what he did, and guarded the roads, lest\r\nsomebody should privately tell the thing to those that were at Jezreel.\r\nNow Jehu took his choice horsemen, and sat upon his chariot, and went on\r\nfor Jezreel; and when he was come near, the watchman whom Joram had set\r\nthere to spy out such as came to the city, saw Jehu marching on, and\r\ntold Joram that he saw a troop of horsemen marching on. Upon which he\r\nimmediately gave orders, that one of his horsemen should be sent out to\r\nmeet them, and to know who it was that was coming. So when the horseman\r\ncame up to Jehu, he asked him in what condition the army was, for that\r\nthe king wanted to know it; but Jehu bid him not at all to meddle with\r\nsuch matters, but to follow him. When the watchman saw this, he told\r\nJoram that the horseman had mingled himself among the company, and came\r\nalong with them. And when the king had sent a second messenger, Jehu\r\ncommanded him to do as the former did; and as soon as the watchman told\r\nthis also to Joram, he at last got upon his chariot himself, together\r\nwith Ahaziah, the king of Jerusalem; for, as we said before, he was\r\nthere to see how Joram did, after he had been wounded, as being his\r\nrelation. So he went out to meet Jehu, who marched slowly, 16 and in\r\ngood order; and when Joram met him in the field of Naboth, he asked him\r\nif all things were well in the camp; but Jehu reproached him bitterly,\r\nand ventured to call his mother a witch and a harlot. Upon this the\r\nking, fearing what he intended, and suspecting he had no good meaning,\r\nturned his chariot about as soon as he could, and said to Ahaziah, \"We\r\nare fought against by deceit and treachery.\" But Jehu drew his bow, and\r\nsmote him, the arrow going through his heart: so Joram fell down\r\nimmediately on his knee, and gave up the ghost. Jehu also gave orders to\r\nBidkar, the captain of the third part of his army, to cast the dead body\r\nof Joram into the field of Naboth, putting him in mind of the prophecy\r\nwhich Elijah prophesied to Ahab his father, when he had slain Naboth,\r\nthat both he and his family should perish in that place; for that as\r\nthey sat behind Ahab's chariot, they heard the prophet say so, and that\r\nit was now come to pass according to his prophecy. Upon the fall of\r\nJoram, Ahaziah was afraid of his own life, and turned his chariot into\r\nanother road, supposing he should not be seen by Jehu; but he followed\r\nafter him, and overtook him at a certain acclivity, and drew his bow,\r\nand wounded him; so he left his chariot, and got upon his horse, and\r\nfled from Jehu to Megiddo; and though he was under cure, in a little\r\ntime he died of that wound, and was carried to Jerusalem, and buried\r\nthere, after he had reigned one year, and had proved a wicked man, and\r\nworse than his father.\r\n\r\n4. Now when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel adorned herself and stood\r\nupon a tower, and said, he was a fine servant that had killed his\r\nmaster! And when he looked up to her, he asked who she was, and\r\ncommanded her to come down to him. At last he ordered the eunuchs to\r\nthrow her down from the tower; and being thrown down, she be-sprinkled\r\nthe wall with her blood, and was trodden upon by the horses, and so\r\ndied. When this was done, Jehu came to the palace with his friends, and\r\ntook some refreshment after his journey, both with other things, and by\r\neating a meal. He also bid his servants to take up Jezebel and bury her,\r\nbecause of the nobility of her blood, for she was descended from kings;\r\nbut those that were appointed to bury her found nothing else remaining\r\nbut the extreme parts of her body, for all the rest were eaten by dogs.\r\nWhen Jehu heard this, he admired the prophecy of Elijah, for he foretold\r\nthat she should perish in this manner at Jezreel.\r\n\r\n5. Now Ahab had seventy sons brought up in Samaria. So Jehu sent two\r\nepistles, the one to them that brought up the children, the other to the\r\nrulers of Samaria, which said, that they should set up the most valiant\r\nof Ahab's sons for king, for that they had abundance of chariots, and\r\nhorses, and armor, and a great army, and fenced cities, and that by so\r\ndoing they might avenge the murder of Ahab. This he wrote to try the\r\nintentions of those of Samaria. Now when the rulers, and those that had\r\nbrought up the children, had read the letter, they were afraid; and\r\nconsidering that they were not at all able to oppose him, who had\r\nalready subdued two very great kings, they returned him this answer:\r\nThat they owned him for their lord, and would do whatsoever he bade\r\nthem. So he wrote back to them such a reply as enjoined them to obey\r\nwhat he gave order for, and to cut off the heads of Ahab's sons, and\r\nsend them to him. Accordingly the rulers sent for those that brought up\r\nthe sons of Ahab, and commanded them to slay them, to cut off their\r\nheads, and send them to Jehu. So they did whatsoever they were\r\ncommanded, without omitting any thing at all, and put them up in wicker\r\nbaskets, and sent them to Jezreel. And when Jehu, as he was at supper\r\nwith his friends, was informed that the heads of Ahab's' sons were\r\nbrought, he ordered them to make two heaps of them, one before each of\r\nthe gates; and in the morning he went out to take a view of them, and\r\nwhen he saw them, he began to say to the people that were present, that\r\nhe did himself make an expedition against his master [Joram], and slew\r\nhim, but that it was not he that slew all these; and he desired them to\r\ntake notice, that as to Ahab's family, all things had come to pass\r\naccording to God's prophecy, and his house was perished, according as\r\nElijah had foretold. And when he had further destroyed all the kindred\r\nof Ahab that were found in Jezreel, he went to Samaria; and as he was\r\nupon the road, he met the relations of Ahaziah king of Jerusalem, and\r\nasked them whither they were going? they replied, that they came to\r\nsalute Joram, and their own king Ahaziah, for they knew not that he had\r\nslain them both. So Jehu gave orders that they should catch these, and\r\nkill them, being in number forty-two persons.\r\n\r\n6. After these, there met him a good and a righteous man, whose name was\r\nJehonadab, and who had been his friend of old. He saluted Jehu, and\r\nbegan to commend him, because he had done every thing according to the\r\nwill of God, in extirpating the house of Ahab. So Jehu desired him to\r\ncome up into his chariot, and make his entry with him into Samaria; and\r\ntold him that he would not spare one wicked man, but would punish the\r\nfalse prophets, and false priests, and those that deceived the\r\nmultitude, and persuaded them to leave the worship of God Almighty, and\r\nto worship foreign gods; and that it was a most excellent and most\r\npleasing sight to a good and a righteous man to see the wicked punished.\r\nSo Jehonadab was persuaded by these arguments, and came up into Jehu's\r\nchariot, and came to Samaria. And Jehu sought out for all Ahab's\r\nkindred, and slew them. And being desirous that none of the false\r\nprophets, nor the priests of Ahab's god, might escape punishment, he\r\ncaught them deceitfully by this wile; for he gathered all the people\r\ntogether, and said that he would worship twice as many gods as Ahab\r\nworshipped, and desired that his priests, and prophets, and servants\r\nmight be present, because he would offer costly and great sacrifices to\r\nAhab's god; and that if any of his priests were wanting, they should be\r\npunished with death. Now Ahab's god was called Baal; and when he had\r\nappointed a day on which he would offer those sacrifices, he sent\r\nmessengers through all the country of the Israelites, that they might\r\nbring the priests of Baal to him. So Jehu commanded to give all the\r\npriests vestments; and when they had received them, he went into the\r\nhouse [of Baal], with his friend Jehonadab, and gave orders to make\r\nsearch whether there were not any foreigner or stranger among them, for\r\nhe would have no one of a different religion to mix among their sacred\r\noffices. And when they said that there was no stranger there, and they\r\nwere beginning their sacrifices, he set fourscore men without, they\r\nbeing such of his soldiers as he knew to be most faithful to him, and\r\nbid them slay the prophets, and now vindicate the laws of their country,\r\nwhich had been a long time in disesteem. He also threatened, that if any\r\none of them escaped, their own lives should go for them. So they slew\r\nthem all with the sword, and burnt the house of Baal, and by that means\r\npurged Samaria of foreign customs [idolatrous worship]. Now this Baal\r\nwas the god of the Tyrians; and Ahab, in order to gratify his father-in-\r\nlaw, Ethbaal, who was the king of Tyre and Sidon, built a temple for him\r\nin Samaria, and appointed him prophets, and worshipped him with all\r\nsorts of worship, although, when this god was demolished, Jehu permitted\r\nthe Israelites to worship the golden heifers. However, because he had\r\ndone thus, and taken care to punish the wicked, God foretold by his\r\nprophet that his sons should reign over Israel for four generations. And\r\nin this condition was Jehu at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How Athaliah Reigned Over Jerusalem For Five [Six] Years When\r\nJehoiada The High Priest Slew Her And Made Jehoash, The Son Of Ahaziah,\r\nKing.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab, heard of the death of her\r\nbrother Joram, and of her son Ahaziah, and of the royal family, she\r\nendeavored that none of the house of David might be left alive, but that\r\nthe whole family might be exterminated, that no king might arise out of\r\nit afterward; and, as she thought, she had actually done it; but one of\r\nAhaziah's sons was preserved, who escaped death after the manner\r\nfollowing: Ahaziah had a sister by the same father, whose name was\r\nJehosheba, and she was married to the high priest Jehoiada. She went\r\ninto the king's palace, and found Jehoash, for that was the little\r\nchild's name, who was not above a year old, among those that were slain,\r\nbut concealed with his nurse; so she took him with her into a secret\r\nbed-chamber, and shut him up there, and she and her husband Jehoiada\r\nbrought him up privately in the temple six years, during which time\r\nAthaliah reigned over Jerusalem and the two tribes.\r\n\r\n2. Now, on the Seventh year, Jehoiada communicated the matter to certain\r\nof the captains of hundreds, five in number, and persuaded them to be\r\nassisting to what attempts he was making against Athaliah, and to join\r\nwith him in asserting the kingdom to the child. He also received such\r\noaths from them as are proper to secure those that assist one another\r\nfrom the fear of discovery; and he was then of good hope that they\r\nshould depose Athaliah. Now those men whom Jehoiada the priest had taken\r\nto be his partners went into all the country, and gathered together the\r\npriests and the Levites, and the heads of the tribes out of it, and came\r\nand brought them to Jerusalem to the high priest. So he demanded the\r\nsecurity of an oath of them, to keep private whatsoever he should\r\ndiscover to them, which required both their silence and their\r\nassistance. So when they had taken the oath, and had thereby made it\r\nsafe for him to speak, he produced the child that he had brought up of\r\nthe family of David, and said to them, \"This is your king, of that house\r\nwhich you know God hath foretold should reign over you for all time to\r\ncome. I exhort you therefore that one-third part of you guard him in the\r\ntemple, and that a fourth part keep watch at all the gates of the\r\ntemple, and that the next part of you keep guard at the gate which opens\r\nand leads to the king's palace, and let the rest of the multitude be\r\nunarmed in the temple, and let no armed person go into the temple, but\r\nthe priest only.\" He also gave them this order besides, \"That a part of\r\nthe priests and the Levites should be about the king himself, and be a\r\nguard to him, with their drawn swords, and to kill that man immediately,\r\nwhoever he be, that should be so bold as to enter armed into the temple;\r\nand bid them be afraid of nobody, but persevere in guarding the king.\"\r\nSo these men obeyed what the high priest advised them to, and declared\r\nthe reality of their resolution by their actions. Jehoiada also opened\r\nthat armory which David had made in the temple, and distributed to the\r\ncaptains of hundreds, as also to the priests and Levites, all the spears\r\nand quivers, and what kind of weapons soever it contained, and set them\r\narmed in a circle round about the temple, so as to touch one another's\r\nhands, and by that means excluding those from entering that ought not to\r\nenter. So they brought the child into the midst of them, and put on him\r\nthe royal crown, and Jehoiada anointed him with the oil, and made him\r\nking; and the multitude rejoiced, and made a noise, and cried, \"God save\r\nthe king!\"\r\n\r\n3. When Athaliah unexpectedly heard the tumult and the acclamations, she\r\nwas greatly disturbed in her mind, and suddenly issued out of the royal\r\npalace with her own army; and when she was come to the temple, the\r\npriests received her; but as for those that stood round about the\r\ntemple, as they were ordered by the high priest to do, they hindered the\r\narmed inert that followed her from going in. But when Athaliah saw the\r\nchild standing upon a pillar, with the royal crown upon his head, she\r\nrent her clothes, and cried out vehemently, and commanded [her guards]\r\nto kill him that had laid snares for her, and endeavored to deprive her\r\nof the government. But Jehoiada called for the captains of hundreds, and\r\ncommanded them to bring Athaliah to the valley of Cedron, and slay her\r\nthere, for he would not have the temple defiled with the punishments of\r\nthis pernicious woman; and he gave order, that if any one came near to\r\nhelp her, he should be slain also; wherefore those that had the charge\r\nof her slaughter took hold of her, and led her to the gate of the king's\r\nmules, and slew her there.\r\n\r\n4. Now as soon as what concerned Athaliah was by this stratagem, after\r\nthis manner, despatched, Jehoiada called together the people and the\r\narmed men into the temple, and made them take an oath that they would be\r\nobedient to the king, and take care of his safety, and of the safety of\r\nhis government; after which he obliged the king to give security [upon\r\noath] that he would worship God, and not transgress the laws of Moses.\r\nThey then ran to the house of Baal, which Athaliah and her husband\r\nJehoram had built, to the dishonor of the God of their fathers, and to\r\nthe honor of Ahab, and demolished it, and slew Mattan, that had his\r\npriesthood. But Jehoiada intrusted the care and custody of the temple to\r\nthe priests and Levites, according to the appointment of king David, and\r\nenjoined them to bring their regular burnt-offerings twice a day, and to\r\noffer incense according to the law. He also ordained some of the\r\nLevites, with the porters, to be a guard to the temple, that no one that\r\nwas defiled might come there.\r\n\r\n5. And when Jehoiada had set these things in order, he, with the\r\ncaptains of hundreds, and the rulers, and all the people, took Jehoash\r\nout of the temple into the king's palace; and when he had set him upon\r\nthe king's throne, the people shouted for joy, and betook themselves to\r\nfeasting, and kept a festival for many days; but the city was quiet upon\r\nthe death of Athaliah. Now Jehoash was seven years old when he took the\r\nkingdom. His mother's name was Zibiah, of the city Beersheba. And all\r\nthe time that Jehoiada lived Jehoash was careful that the laws should be\r\nkept, and very zealous in the worship of God; and when he was of age, he\r\nmarried two wives, who were given to him by the high priest, by whom\r\nwere born to him both sons and daughters. And thus much shall suffice to\r\nhave related concerning king Jehoash, how he escaped the treachery of\r\nAthaliah, and how he received the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. Hazael Makes An Expedition Against The People Of Israel And\r\nThe Inhabitants Of Jerusalem. Jehu Dies, And Jehoahaz Succeeds In The\r\nGovernment. Jehoash The King Of Jerusalem At First Is Careful About The\r\nWorship Of God But Afterwards Becomes Impious And Commands Zechariah To\r\nBe Stoned. When Jehoash [King Of Judah] Was Dead, Amaziah Succeeds Him\r\nIn The Kingdom.\r\n\r\n1. Now Hazael, king of Syria, fought against the Israelites and their\r\nking Jehu, and spoiled the eastern parts of the country beyond Jordan,\r\nwhich belonged to the Reubenites and Gadites, and to [the half tribe of]\r\nManassites; as also Gilead and Bashan, burning, and spoiling, and\r\noffering violence to all that he laid his hands on, and this without\r\nimpeachment from Jehu, who made no haste to defend the country when it\r\nwas under this distress; nay, he was become a contemner of religion, and\r\na despiser of holiness, and of the laws, and died when he had reigned\r\nover the Israelites twenty-seven years. He was buried in Samaria, and\r\nleft Jehoahaz his son his successor in the government.\r\n\r\n2. Now Jehoash, king of Jerusalem, had an inclination to repair the\r\ntemple of God; so he called Jehoiada, and bid him send the Levites and\r\npriests through all the country, to require half a shekel of silver for\r\nevery head, towards the rebuilding and repairing of the temple, which\r\nwas brought to decay by Jehoram, and Athaliah and her sons. But the high\r\npriest did not do this, as concluding that no one would willingly pay\r\nthat money; but in the twenty-third year of Jehoash's reign, when the\r\nking sent for him and the Levites, and complained that they had not\r\nobeyed what he enjoined them, and still commanded them to take care of\r\nthe rebuilding the temple, he used this stratagem for collecting the\r\nmoney, with which the multitude was pleased. He made a wooden chest, and\r\nclosed it up fast on all sides, but opened one hole in it; he then set\r\nit in the temple beside the altar, and desired every one to cast into\r\nit, through the hole, what he pleased, for the repair of the temple.\r\nThis contrivance was acceptable to the people, and they strove one with\r\nanother, and brought in jointly large quantities of silver and gold; and\r\nwhen the scribe and the priest that were over the treasuries had emptied\r\nthe chest, and counted the money in the king's presence, they then set\r\nit in its former place, and thus did they every day. But when the\r\nmultitude appeared to have cast in as much as was wanted, the high\r\npriest Jehoiada, and king Joash, sent to hire masons and carpenters, and\r\nto buy large pieces of timber, and of the most curious sort; and when\r\nthey had repaired the temple, they made use of the remaining gold and\r\nsilver, which was not a little, for bowls, and basons, and cups, and\r\nother vessels, and they went on to make the altar every day fat with\r\nsacrifices of great value. And these things were taken suitable care of\r\nas long as Jehoiada lived.\r\n\r\n3. But as soon as he was dead [which was when he had lived one hundred\r\nand thirty years, having been a righteous, and in every respect a very\r\ngood man, and was buried in the king's sepulchers at Jerusalem, because\r\nhe had recovered the kingdom to the family of David] king Jehoash\r\nbetrayed his [want of] care about God. The principal men of the people\r\nwere corrupted also together with him, and offended against their duty,\r\nand what their constitution determined to be most for their good.\r\nHereupon God was displeased with the change that was made on the king,\r\nand on the rest of the people, and sent prophets to testify to them what\r\ntheir actions were, and to bring them to leave off their wickedness; but\r\nthey had gotten such a strong affection and so violent an inclination to\r\nit, that neither could the examples of those that had offered affronts\r\nto the laws, and had been so severely punished, they and their entire\r\nfamilies, nor could the fear of what the prophets now foretold, bring\r\nthem to repentance, and turn them back from their course of\r\ntransgression to their former duty. But the king commanded that\r\nZechariah, the son of the high priest Jehoiada, should be stoned to\r\ndeath in the temple, and forgot the kindnesses he had received from his\r\nfather; for when God had appointed him to prophesy, he stood in the\r\nmidst of the multitude, and gave this counsel to them and to the king:\r\nThat they should act righteously; and foretold to them, that if they\r\nwould not hearken to his admonitions, they should suffer a heavy\r\npunishment. But as Zechariah was ready to die, he appealed to God as a\r\nwitness of what he suffered for the good counsel he had given them, and\r\nhow he perished after a most severe and violent manner for the good\r\ndeeds his father had done to Jehoash.\r\n\r\n4. However, it was not long before the king suffered punishment for his\r\ntransgression; for when Hazael, king of Syria, made an irruption into\r\nhis country, and when he had overthrown Gath, and spoiled it, he made an\r\nexpedition against Jerusalem; upon which Jehoash was afraid, and emptied\r\nall the treasures of God and of the kings [before him], and took down\r\nthe gifts that had been dedicated [in the temple], and sent them to the\r\nking of Syria, and procured so much by them, that he was not besieged,\r\nnor his kingdom quite endangered; but Hazael was induced by the\r\ngreatness of the sum of money not to bring his army against Jerusalem;\r\nyet Jehoash fell into a severe distemper, and was set upon by his\r\nfriends, in order to revenge the death of Zechariah, the son of\r\nJehoiada. These laid snares for the king, and slew him. He was indeed\r\nburied in Jerusalem, but not in the royal sepulchers of his forefathers,\r\nbecause of his impiety. He lived forty-seven years, and Amaziah his son\r\nsucceeded him in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n5. In the one and twentieth year of the reign of Jehoash, Jehoahaz, the\r\nson of Jehu, took the government of the Israelites in Samaria, and held\r\nit seventeen years. He did not [properly] imitate his father, but was\r\nguilty of as wicked practices as those that first had God in contempt:\r\nbut the king of Syria brought him low, and by an expedition against him\r\ndid so greatly reduce his forces, that there remained no more of so\r\ngreat an army than ten thousand armed men, and fifty horsemen. He also\r\ntook away from him his great cities, and many of them also, and\r\ndestroyed his army. And these were the things that the people of Israel\r\nsuffered, according to the prophecy of Elisha, when he foretold that\r\nHazael should kill his master, and reign over the Syrians and Damscenes.\r\nBut when Jehoahaz was under such unavoidable miseries, he had recourse\r\nto prayer and supplication to God, and besought him to deliver him out\r\nof the hands of Hazael, and not overlook him, and give him up into his\r\nhands. Accordingly God accepted of his repentance instead of virtue; and\r\nbeing desirous rather to admonish those that might repent, and not to\r\ndetermine that they should be utterly destroyed, he granted him\r\ndeliverance from war and dangers. So the country having obtained peace,\r\nreturned again to its former condition, and flourished as before.\r\n\r\n6. Now after the death of Jehoahaz, his son Joash took the kingdom, in\r\nthe thirty-seventh year of Jehoash, the king of the tribe of Judah. This\r\nJoash then took the kingdom of Israel in Samaria, for he had the same\r\nname with the king of Jerusalem, and he retained the kingdom sixteen\r\nyears. He was a good man, 17 and in his disposition was not at all like\r\nhis father. Now at this time it was that when Elisha the prophet, who\r\nwas already very old, and was now fallen into a disease, the king of\r\nIsrael came to visit him; and when he found him very near death, he\r\nbegan to weep in his sight, and lament, to call him his father, and his\r\nweapons, because it was by his means that he never made use of his\r\nweapons against his enemies, but that he overcame his own adversaries by\r\nhis prophecies, without fighting; and that he was now departing this\r\nlife, and leaving him to the Syrians, that were already armed, and to\r\nother enemies of his that were under their power; so he said it was not\r\nsafe for him to live any longer, but that it would be well for him to\r\nhasten to his end, and depart out of this life with him. As the king was\r\nthus bemoaning himself, Elisha comforted him, and bid the king bend a\r\nbow that was brought him; and when the king had fitted the bow for\r\nshooting, Elisha took hold of his hands and bid him shoot; and when he\r\nhad shot three arrows, and then left off, Elisha said, \"If thou hadst\r\nshot more arrows, thou hadst cut the kingdom of Syria up by the roots;\r\nbut since thou hast been satisfied with shooting three times only, thou\r\nshalt fight and beat the Syrians no more times than three, that thou\r\nmayst recover that country which they cut off from thy kingdom in the\r\nreign of thy father.\" So when the king had heard that, he departed; and\r\na little while after the prophet died. He was a man celebrated for\r\nrighteousness, and in eminent favor with God. He also performed\r\nwonderful and surprising works by prophecy, and such as were gloriously\r\npreserved in memory by the Hebrews. He also obtained a magnificent\r\nfuneral, such a one indeed as it was fit a person so beloved of God\r\nshould have. It also happened, that at that time certain robbers cast a\r\nman whom they had slain into Elisha's grave, and upon his dead body\r\ncoming close to Elisha's body, it revived again. And thus far have we\r\nenlarged about the actions of Elisha the prophet, both such as he did\r\nwhile he was alive, and how he had a Divine power after his death also.\r\n\r\n7. Now, upon the death of Hazael, the king of Syria, that kingdom came\r\nto Adad his son, with whom Joash, king of Israel, made war; and when he\r\nhad beaten him in three battles, he took from him all that country, and\r\nall those cities and villages, which his father Hazael had taken from\r\nthe kingdom of Israel, which came to pass, however, according to the\r\nprophecy of Elisha. But when Joash happened to die, he was buried in\r\nSamaria, and the government devolved on his son Jeroboam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. How Amaziah Made An Expedition Against The Edomites And\r\nAmalekites And Conquered Them; But When He Afterwards Made War Against\r\nJoash, He Was Beaten And Not Long After Was Slain, And Uzziah Succeeded\r\nIn The Government.\r\n\r\n1. Now, in the second year of the reign of Joash over Israel, Amaziah\r\nreigned over the tribe of Judah in Jerusalem. His mother's name was\r\nJehoaddan, who was born at Jerusalem. He was exceeding careful of doing\r\nwhat was right, and this when he was very young; but when he came to the\r\nmanagement of affairs, and to the government, he resolved that he ought\r\nfirst of all to avenge his father Je-hoash, and to punish those his\r\nfriends that had laid violent hands upon him: so he seized upon them\r\nall, and put them to death; yet did he execute no severity on their\r\nchildren, but acted therein according to the laws of Moses, who did not\r\nthink it just to punish children for the sins of their fathers. After\r\nthis he chose him an army out of the tribe of Judah and Benjamin, of\r\nsuch as were in the flower of their age, and about twenty years old; and\r\nwhen he had collected about three hundred thousand of them together, he\r\nset captains of hundreds over them. He also sent to the king of Israel,\r\nand hired a hundred thousand of his soldiers for a hundred talents of\r\nsilver, for he had resolved to make an expedition against the nations of\r\nthe Amalekites, and Edomites, and Gebalites: but as he was preparing for\r\nhis expedition, and ready to go out to the war, a prophet gave him\r\ncounsel to dismiss the army of the Israelites, because they were bad\r\nmen, and because God foretold that he should be beaten, if he made use\r\nof them as auxiliaries; but that he should overcome his enemies, though\r\nhe had but a few soldiers, when it so pleased God. And when the king\r\ngrudged at his having already paid the hire of the Israelites, the\r\nprophet exhorted him to do what God would have him, because he should\r\nthereby obtain much wealth from God. So he dismissed them, and said that\r\nhe still freely gave them their pay, and went himself with his own army,\r\nand made war with the nations before mentioned; and when he had beaten\r\nthem in battle, he slew of them ten thousand, and took as many prisoners\r\nalive, whom he brought to the great rock which is in Arabia, and threw\r\nthem down from it headlong. He also brought away a great deal of prey\r\nand vast riches from those nations. But while Amaziah was engaged in\r\nthis expedition, those Israelites whom he had hired, and then dismissed,\r\nwere very uneasy at it, and taking their dismission for an affront, [as\r\nsupposing that this would not have been done to them but out of\r\ncontempt,] they fell upon his kingdom, and proceeded to spoil the\r\ncountry as far as Beth- horon, and took much cattle, and slew three\r\nthousand men.\r\n\r\n2. Now upon the victory which Amaziah had gotten, and the great acts he\r\nhad done, he was puffed up, and began to overlook God, who had given him\r\nthe victory, and proceeded to worship the gods he had brought out of the\r\ncountry of the Amalekites. So a prophet came to him, and said, that he\r\nwondered how he could esteem these to be gods, who had been of no\r\nadvantage to their own people who paid them honors, nor had delivered\r\nthem from his hands, but had overlooked the destruction of many of them,\r\nand had suffered themselves to be carried captive, for that they had\r\nbeen carried to Jerusalem in the same manner as any one might have taken\r\nsome of the enemy alive, and led them thither. This reproof provoked the\r\nking to anger, and he commanded the prophet to hold his peace, and\r\nthreatened to punish him if he meddled with his conduct. So he replied,\r\nthat he should indeed hold his peace; but foretold withal, that God\r\nwould not overlook his attempts for innovation. But Amaziah was not able\r\nto contain himself under that prosperity which God had given him,\r\nalthough he had affronted God thereupon; but in a vein of insolence he\r\nwrote to Joash, the king of Israel, and commanded that he and all his\r\npeople should be obedient to him, as they had formerly been obedient to\r\nhis progenitors, David and Solomon; and he let him know, that if he\r\nwould not be so wise as to do what he commanded him, he must fight for\r\nhis dominion. To which message Joash returned this answer in writing:\r\n\"King Joash to king Amaziah. There was a vastly tall cypress tree in\r\nMount Lebanon, as also a thistle; this thistle sent to the cypress tree\r\nto give the cypress tree's daughter in marriage to the thistle's son;\r\nbut as the thistle was saying this, there came a wild beast, and trod\r\ndown the thistle: and this may be a lesson to thee, not to be so\r\nambitious, and to have a care, lest upon thy good success in the fight\r\nagainst the Amalekites thou growest so proud, as to bring dangers upon\r\nthyself and upon thy kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n3. When Amaziah had read this letter, he was more eager upon this\r\nexpedition, which, I suppose, was by the impulse of God, that he might\r\nbe punished for his offense against him. But as soon as he led out his\r\narmy against Joash, and they were going to join battle with him, there\r\ncame such a fear and consternation upon the army of Amaziah, as God,\r\nwhen he is displeased, sends upon men, and discomfited them, even before\r\nthey came to a close fight. Now it happened, that as they were scattered\r\nabout by the terror that was upon them, Amaziah was left alone, and was\r\ntaken prisoner by the enemy; whereupon Joash threatened to kill him,\r\nunless he would persuade the people of Jerusalem to open their gates to\r\nhim, and receive him and his army into the city. Accordingly Amaziah was\r\nso distressed, and in such fear of his life, that he made his enemy to\r\nbe received into the city. So Joash over threw a part of the wall, of\r\nthe length of four hundred cubits, and drove his chariot through the\r\nbreach into Jerusalem, and led Amaziah captive along with him; by which\r\nmeans he became master of Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of God,\r\nand carried off all the gold and silver that was in the king's palace,\r\nand then freed the king from captivity, and returned to Samaria. Now\r\nthese things happened to the people of Jerusalem in the fourteenth year\r\nof the reign of Amaziah, who after this had a conspiracy made against\r\nhim by his friends, and fled to the city Lachish, and was there slain by\r\nthe conspirators, who sent men thither to kill him. So they took up his\r\ndead body, and carried it to Jerusalem, and made a royal funeral for\r\nhim. This was the end of the life of Amaziah, because of his innovations\r\nin religion, and his contempt of God, when he had lived fifty-four\r\nyears, and had reigned twenty-nine. He was succeeded by his son, whose\r\nname was Uzziah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. Concerning Jeroboam King Of Israel And Jonah The Prophet;\r\nAnd How After The Death Of Jeroboam His Son Zachariah Took The\r\nGovernment. How Uzziah, King Of Jerusalem, Subdued The Nations That Were\r\nRound About Him; And What Befell Him When He Attempted To Offer Incense\r\nTo God.\r\n\r\n1. In the fifteenth year of the reign of Amaziah, Jeroboam the son of\r\nJoash reigned over Israel in Samaria forty years. This king was guilty\r\nof contumely against God, 18 and became very wicked in worshipping of\r\nidols, and in many undertakings that were absurd and foreign. He was\r\nalso the cause of ten thousand misfortunes to the people of Israel. Now\r\none Jonah, a prophet, foretold to him that he should make war with the\r\nSyrians, and conquer their army, and enlarge the bounds of his kingdom\r\non the northern parts to the city Hamath, and on the southern to the\r\nlake Asphaltitis; for the bounds of the Canaanites originally were\r\nthese, as Joshua their general had determined them. So Jeroboam made an\r\nexpedition against the Syrians, and overran all their country, as Jonah\r\nhad foretold.\r\n\r\n2. Now I cannot but think it necessary for me, who have promised to give\r\nan accurate account of our affairs, to describe the actions of this\r\nprophet, so far as I have found them written down in the Hebrew books.\r\nJonah had been commanded by God to go to the kingdom of Nineveh; and\r\nwhen he was there, to publish it in that city, how it should lose the\r\ndominion it had over the nations. But he went not, out of fear; nay, he\r\nran away from God to the city of Joppa, and finding a ship there, he\r\nwent into it, and sailed to Tarsus, in Cilicia 19 and upon the rise of a\r\nmost terrible storm, which was so great that the ship was in danger of\r\nsinking, the mariners, the master, and the pilot himself, made prayers\r\nand vows, in case they escaped the sea: but Jonah lay still and covered\r\n[in the ship,] without imitating any thing that the others did; but as\r\nthe waves grew greater, and the sea became more violent by the winds,\r\nthey suspected, as is usual in such cases, that some one of the persons\r\nthat sailed with them was the occasion of this storm, and agreed to\r\ndiscover by lot 20 which of them it was. When they had cast lots, 21 the\r\nlot fell upon the prophet; and when they asked him whence he came, and\r\nwhat he had done? he replied, that he was a Hebrew by nation, and a\r\nprophet of Almighty God; and he persuaded them to cast him into the sea,\r\nif they would escape the danger they were in, for that he was the\r\noccasion of the storm which was upon them. Now at the first they durst\r\nnot do so, as esteeming it a wicked thing to cast a man who was a\r\nstranger, and who had committed his life to them, into such manifest\r\nperdition; but at last, when their misfortune overbore them, and the\r\nship was just going to be drowned, and when they were animated to do it\r\nby the prophet himself, and by the fear concerning their own safety,\r\nthey cast him into the sea; upon which the sea became calm. It is also\r\nreported that Jonah was swallowed down by a whale, and that when he had\r\nbeen there three days, and as many nights, he was vomited out upon the\r\nEuxine Sea, and this alive, and without any hurt upon his body; and\r\nthere, on his prayer to God, he obtained pardon for his sins, and went\r\nto the city Nineveh, where he stood so as to be heard, and preached,\r\nthat in a very little time they should lose the dominion of Asia. And\r\nwhen he had published this, he returned. Now I have given this account\r\nabout him as I found it written [in our books.]\r\n\r\n3. When Jeroboam the king had passed his life in great happiness, and\r\nhad ruled forty years, he died, and was buried in Samaria, and his son\r\nZachariah took the kingdom. After the same manner did Uzziah, the son of\r\nAmaziah, begin to reign over the two tribes in Jerusalem, in the\r\nfourteenth year of the reign of Jeroboam. He was born of Jecoliah, his\r\nmother, who was a citizen of Jerusalem. He was a good man, and by nature\r\nrighteous and magnanimous, and very laborious in taking care of the\r\naffairs of his kingdom. He made an expedition also against the\r\nPhilistines, and overcame them in battle, and took the cities of Gath\r\nand Jabneh, and brake down their walls; after which expedition he\r\nassaulted those Arabs that adjoined to Egypt. He also built a city upon\r\nthe Red Sea, and put a garrison into it. He, after this, overthrew the\r\nAmmonites, and appointed that they should pay tribute. He also overcame\r\nall the countries as far as the bounds of Egypt, and then began to take\r\ncare of Jerusalem itself for the rest of his life; for he rebuilt and\r\nrepaired all those parts of the wall which had either fallen down by\r\nlength of time, or by the carelessness of the kings, his predecessors,\r\nas well as all that part which had been thrown down by the king of\r\nIsrael, when he took his father Amaziah prisoner, and entered with him\r\ninto the city. Moreover, he built a great many towers, of one hundred\r\nand fifty cubits high, and built walled towns in desert places, and put\r\ngarrisons into them, and dug many channels for conveyance of water. He\r\nhad also many beasts for labor, and an immense number of cattle; for his\r\ncountry was fit for pasturage. He was also given to husbandry, and took\r\ncare to cultivate the ground, and planted it with all sorts of plants,\r\nand sowed it with all sorts of seeds. He had also about him an army\r\ncomposed of chosen men, in number three hundred and seventy thousand,\r\nwho were governed by general officers and captains of thousands, who\r\nwere men of valor, and of unconquerable strength, in number two\r\nthousand. He also divided his whole army into bands, and armed them,\r\ngiving every one a sword, with brazen bucklers and breastplates, with\r\nbows and slings; and besides these, he made for them many engines of war\r\nfor besieging of cities, such as cast stones and darts, with grapplers,\r\nand other instruments of that sort.\r\n\r\n4. While Uzziah was in this state, and making preparation [for\r\nfuturity], he was corrupted in his mind by pride, and became insolent,\r\nand this on account of that abundance which he had of things that will\r\nsoon perish, and despised that power which is of eternal duration [which\r\nconsisted in piety towards God, and in the observation of the laws]; so\r\nhe fell by occasion of the good success of his affairs, and was carried\r\nheadlong into those sins of his father, which the splendor of that\r\nprosperity he enjoyed, and the glorious actions he had done, led him\r\ninto, while he was not able to govern himself well about them.\r\nAccordingly, when a remarkable day was come, and a general festival was\r\nto be celebrated, he put on the holy garment, and went into the temple\r\nto offer incense to God upon the golden altar, which he was prohibited\r\nto do by Azariah the high priest, who had fourscore priests with him,\r\nand who told him that it was not lawful for him to offer sacrifice, and\r\nthat \"none besides the posterity of Aaron were permitted so to do.\" And\r\nwhen they cried out that he must go out of the temple, and not\r\ntransgress against God, he was wroth at them, and threatened to kill\r\nthem, unless they would hold their peace. In the mean time a great\r\nearthquake shook the ground and a rent was made in the temple, and the\r\nbright rays of the sun shone through it, and fell upon the king's face,\r\ninsomuch that the leprosy seized upon him immediately. And before the\r\ncity, at a place called Eroge, half the mountain broke off from the rest\r\non the west, and rolled itself four furlongs, and stood still at the\r\neast mountain, till the roads, as well as the king's gardens, were\r\nspoiled by the obstruction. Now, as soon as the priests saw that the\r\nking's face was infected with the leprosy, they told him of the calamity\r\nhe was under, and commanded that he should go out of the city as a\r\npolluted person. Hereupon he was so confounded at the sad distemper, and\r\nsensible that he was not at liberty to contradict, that he did as he was\r\ncommanded, and underwent this miserable and terrible punishment for an\r\nintention beyond what befitted a man to have, and for that impiety\r\nagainst God which was implied therein. So he abode out of the city for\r\nsome time, and lived a private life, while his son Jotham took the\r\ngovernment; after which he died with grief and anxiety at what had\r\nhappened to him, when he had lived sixty-eight years, and reigned of\r\nthem fifty-two; and was buried by himself in his own gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. How Zachariah Shallum, Menahem Pekahiah And Pekah Took The\r\nGovernment Over The Israelites; And How Pul And Tiglath-Pileser Made An\r\nExpedition Against The Israelites. How Jotham, The Son Of Uzziah Reigned\r\nOver The Tribe Of Judah; And What Things Nahum Prophesied Against The\r\nAssyrians.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Zachariah, the son of Jeroboam, had reigned six months over\r\nIsrael, he was slain by the treachery of a certain friend of his, whose\r\nname was Shallum, the son of Jabesh, who took the kingdom afterward, but\r\nkept it no longer than thirty days; for Menahem, the general of his\r\narmy, who was at that time in the city Tirzah, and heard of what had\r\nbefallen Zachariah, removed thereupon with all his forces to Samaria,\r\nand joining battle with Shallum, slew him; and when he had made himself\r\nking, he went thence, and came to the city Tiphsah; but the citizens\r\nthat were in it shut their gates, and barred them against the king, and\r\nwould not admit him: but in order to be avenged on them, he burnt the\r\ncountry round about it, and took the city by force, upon a siege; and\r\nbeing very much displeased at what the inhabitants of Tiphsah had done,\r\nhe slew them all, and spared not so much as the infants, without\r\nomitting the utmost instances of cruelty and barbarity; for he used such\r\nseverity upon his own countrymen, as would not be pardonable with regard\r\nto strangers who had been conquered by him. And after this manner it was\r\nthat this Menahem 22 continued to reign with cruelty and barbarity for\r\nten years. But when Pul, king of Assyria, had made an expedition against\r\nhim, he did not think meet to fight or engage in battle with the\r\nAssyrians, but he persuaded him to accept of a thousand talents of\r\nsilver, and to go away, and so put an end to the war. This sum the\r\nmultitude collected for Menahem, by exacting fifty drachmae as poll-\r\nmoney for every head; 23 after which he died, and was buried in Samaria,\r\nand left his son Pekahiah his successor in the kingdom, who followed the\r\nbarbarity of his father, and so ruled but two years only, after which he\r\nwas slain with his friends at a feast, by the treachery of one Pekah,\r\nthe general of his horse, and the son of Remaliah, who laid snares for\r\nhim. Now this Pekah held the government twenty years, and proved a\r\nwicked man and a transgressor. But the king of Assyria, whose name was\r\nTiglath-Pileser, when he had made an expedition against the Israelites,\r\nand had overrun all the land of Gilead, and the region beyond Jordan,\r\nand the adjoining country, which is called Galilee, and Kadesh, and\r\nHazor, he made the inhabitants prisoners, and transplanted them into his\r\nown kingdom. And so much shall suffice to have related here concerning\r\nthe king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n2. Now Jotham the son of Uzziah reigned over the tribe of Judah in\r\nJerusalem, being a citizen thereof by his mother, whose name was\r\nJerusha. This king was not defective in any virtue, but was religious\r\ntowards God, and righteous towards men, and careful of the good of the\r\ncity [for what part soever wanted to be repaired or adorned he\r\nmagnificently repaired and adorned them]. He also took care of the\r\nfoundations of the cloisters in the temple, and repaired the walls that\r\nwere fallen down, and built very great towers, and such as were almost\r\nimpregnable; and if any thing else in his kingdom had been neglected, he\r\ntook great care of it. He also made an expedition against the Ammonites,\r\nand overcame them in battle, and ordered them to pay tribute, a hundred\r\ntalents, and ten thousand cori of wheat, and as many of barley, every\r\nyear, and so augmented his kingdom, that his enemies could not despise\r\nit, and his own people lived happily.\r\n\r\n3. Now there was at that time a prophet, whose name was Nahum, who spake\r\nafter this manner concerning the overthrow of the Assyrians and of\r\nNineveh: \"Nineveh shall be a pool of water in motion so shall all her\r\npeople be troubled, and tossed, and go away by flight, while they say\r\none to another, Stand, stand still, seize their gold and silver, for\r\nthere shall be no one to wish them well, for they will rather save their\r\nlives than their money; for a terrible contention shall possess them one\r\nwith another, and lamentation, and loosing of the members, and their\r\ncountenances shall be perfectly black with fear. And there will be the\r\nden of the lions, and the mother of the young lions! God says to thee,\r\nNineveh, that they shall deface thee, and the lion shall no longer go\r\nout from thee to give laws to the world.\" And indeed this prophet\r\nprophesied many other things besides these concerning Nineveh, which I\r\ndo not think necessary to repeat, and I here omit them, that I may not\r\nappear troublesome to my readers; all which thing happened about Nineveh\r\na hundred and fifteen years afterward: so this may suffice to have\r\nspoken of these matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. How Upon The Death Of Jotham, Ahaz Reigned In His Stead;\r\nAgainst Whom Rezin, King Of Syria And Pekah King Of Israel, Made War;\r\nAnd How Tiglath-Pileser, King Of Assyria Came To The Assistance Of Ahaz,\r\nAnd Laid Syria Waste And Removing The Damascenes Into Media Placed Other\r\nNations In Their Room.\r\n\r\n1. Now Jotham died when he had lived forty-one years, and of them\r\nreigned sixteen, and was buried in the sepulchers of the kings; and the\r\nkingdom came to his son Ahaz, who proved most impious towards God, and a\r\ntransgressor of the laws of his country. He imitated the kings of\r\nIsrael, and reared altars in Jerusalem, and offered sacrifices upon them\r\nto idols; to which also he offered his own son as a burnt-offering,\r\naccording to the practices of the Canaanites. His other actions were\r\nalso of the same sort. Now as he was going on in this mad course, Rezin,\r\nthe king of Syria and Damascus, and Pekah, the king of Israel, who were\r\nnow at amity one with another, made war with him; and when they had\r\ndriven him into Jerusalem, they besieged that city a long while, making\r\nbut a small progress, on account of the strength of its walls; and when\r\nthe king of Syria had taken the city Elath, upon the Red Sea, and had\r\nslain the inhabitants, he peopled it with Syrians; and when he had slain\r\nthose in the [other] garrisons, and the Jews in their neighborhood, and\r\nhad driven away much prey, he returned with his army back to Damascus.\r\nNow when the king of Jerusalem knew that the Syrians were returned home,\r\nhe, supposing himself a match for the king of Israel, drew out his army\r\nagainst him, and joining battle with him was beaten; and this happened\r\nbecause God was angry with him, on account of his many and great\r\nenormities. Accordingly there were slain by the Israelites one hundred\r\nand twenty thousand of his men that day, whose general, Amaziah by name,\r\nslew Zechariah the king's son, in his conflict with Ahaz, as well as the\r\ngovernor of the kingdom, whose name was Azricam. He also carried\r\nElkanah, the general of the troops of the tribe of Judah, into\r\ncaptivity. They also carried the women and children of the tribe of\r\nBenjamin captives; and when they had gotten a great deal of prey, they\r\nreturned to Samaria.\r\n\r\n2. Now there was one Obed, who was a prophet at that time in Samaria; he\r\nmet the army before the city walls, and with a loud voice told them that\r\nthey had gotten the victory not by their own strength, but by reason of\r\nthe anger God had against king Ahaz. And he complained that they were\r\nnot satisfied with the good success they had had against him, but were\r\nso bold as to make captives out of their kinsmen the tribes of Judah and\r\nBenjamin. He also gave them counsel to let them go home without doing\r\nthem any harm, for that if they did not obey God herein, they should be\r\npunished. So the people of Israel came together to their assembly, and\r\nconsidered of these matters, when a man whose name was Berechiah, and\r\nwho was one of chief reputation in the government, stood up, and the\r\nothers with him, and said, \"We will not suffer the citizens to bring\r\nthese prisoners into the city, lest we be all destroyed by God; we have\r\nsins enough of our own that we have committed against him, as the\r\nprophets assure us; nor ought we therefore to introduce the practice of\r\nnew crimes.\" When the soldiers heard that, they permitted them to do\r\nwhat they thought best. So the forenamed men took the captives, and let\r\nthem go, and took care of them, and gave them provisions, and sent them\r\nto their own country, without doing them any harm. However, these four\r\nwent along with them, and conducted them as far as Jericho, which is not\r\nfar from Jerusalem, and returned to Samaria.\r\n\r\n3. Hereupon king Ahaz, having been so thoroughly beaten by the\r\nIsraelites, sent to Tiglath-Pileser, king of the Assyrians, and sued for\r\nassistance from him in his war against the Israelites, and Syrians, and\r\nDamascenes, with a promise to send him much money; he sent him also\r\ngreat presents at the same time. Now this king, upon the reception of\r\nthose ambassadors, came to assist Ahaz, and made war upon the Syrians,\r\nand laid their country waste, and took Damascus by force, and slew Rezin\r\ntheir king, and transplanted the people of Damascus into the Upper\r\nMedia, and brought a colony of Assyrians, and planted them in Damascus.\r\nHe also afflicted the land of Israel, and took many captives out of it.\r\nWhile he was doing thus with the Syrians, king Ahaz took all the gold\r\nthat was in the king's treasures, and the silver, and what was in the\r\ntemple of God, and what precious gifts were there, and he carried them\r\nwith him, and came to Damascus, and gave it to the king of Assyria,\r\naccording to his agreement. So he confessed that he owed him thanks for\r\nall he had done for him, and returned to Jerusalem. Now this king was so\r\nsottish and thoughtless of what was for his own good, that he would not\r\nleave off worshipping the Syrian gods when he was beaten by them, but he\r\nwent on in worshipping them, as though they would procure him the\r\nvictory; and when he was beaten again, he began to honor the gods of the\r\nAssyrians; and he seemed more desirous to honor any other gods than his\r\nown paternal and true God, whose anger was the cause of his defeat; nay,\r\nhe proceeded to such a degree of despite and contempt [of God's\r\nworship], that he shut up the temple entirely, and forbade them to bring\r\nin the appointed sacrifices, and took away the gifts that had been given\r\nto it. And when he had offered these indignities to God, he died, having\r\nlived thirty-six years, and of them reigned sixteen; and he left his son\r\nHezekiah for his successor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. How Pekah Died By The Treachery Of Hoshea Who Was A Little\r\nAfter Subdued By Shalmaneser; And How Hezekiah Reigned Instead Of Ahaz;\r\nAnd What Actions Of Piety And Justice He Did.\r\n\r\n1. About the same time Pekah, the king of Israel, died by the treachery\r\nof a friend of his, whose name was Hoshea, who retained the kingdom nine\r\nyears' time, but was a wicked man, and a despiser of the Divine worship;\r\nand Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria, made an expedition against him,\r\nand overcame him, [which must have been because he had not God favorable\r\nnor assistant to him,] and brought him to submission, and ordered him to\r\npay an appointed tribute. Now, in the fourth year of the reign of\r\nHoshea, Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, began to reign in Jerusalem; and his\r\nmother's name was Abijah, a citizen of Jerusalem. His nature was good,\r\nand righteous, and religious; for when he came to the kingdom, he\r\nthought that nothing was prior, or more necessary, or more advantageous\r\nto himself, and to his subjects, than to worship God. Accordingly, he\r\ncalled the people together, and the priests, and the Levites, and made a\r\nspeech to them, and said, \"You are not ignorant how, by the sins of my\r\nfather, who transgressed that sacred honor which was due to God, you\r\nhave had experience of many and great miseries, while you were corrupted\r\nin your mind by him, and were induced to worship those which he supposed\r\nto be gods; I exhort you, therefore, who have learned by sad experience\r\nhow dangerous a thing impiety is, to put that immediately out of your\r\nmemory, and to purify yourselves from your former pollutions, and to\r\nopen the temple to these priests and Levites who are here convened, and\r\nto cleanse it with the accustomed sacrifices, and to recover all to the\r\nancient honor which our fathers paid to it; for by this means we may\r\nrender God favorable, and he will remit the anger he hath had to us.\"\r\n\r\n2. When the king had said this, the priests opened the temple; and when\r\nthey had set in order the vessels of God, and east out what was impure,\r\nthey laid the accustomed sacrifices upon the altar. The king also sent\r\nto the country that was under him, and called the people to Jerusalem to\r\ncelebrate the feast of unleavened bread, for it had been intermitted a\r\nlong time, on account of the wickedness of the forementioned kings. He\r\nalso sent to the Israelites, and exhorted them to leave off their\r\npresent way of living, and return to their ancient practices, and to\r\nworship God, for that he gave them leave to come to Jerusalem, and to\r\ncelebrate, all in one body, the feast of unleavened bread; and this he\r\nsaid was by way of invitation only, and to be done of their own good-\r\nwill, and for their own advantage, and not out of obedience to him,\r\nbecause it would make them happy. But the Israelites, upon the coming of\r\nthe ambassadors, and upon their laying before them what they had in\r\ncharge from their own king, were so far from complying therewith, that\r\nthey laughed the ambassadors to scorn, and mocked them as fools: as also\r\nthey affronted the prophets, which gave them the same exhortations, and\r\nforetold what they would suffer if they did not return to the worship of\r\nGod, insomuch that at length they caught them, and slew them; nor did\r\nthis degree of transgressing suffice them, but they had more wicked\r\ncontrivances than what have been described: nor did they leave off,\r\nbefore God, as a punishment for their impiety, brought them under their\r\nenemies: but of that more hereafter. However, many there were of the\r\ntribe of Manasseh, and of Zebulon, and of Issachar, who were obedient to\r\nwhat the prophets exhorted them to do, and returned to the worship of\r\nGod. Now all these came running to Jerusalem, to Hezekiah, that they\r\nmight worship God [there].\r\n\r\n3. When these men were come, king Hezekiah went up into the temple, with\r\nthe rulers and all the people, and offered for himself seven bulls, and\r\nas many rams, with seven lambs, and as many kids of the goats. The king\r\nalso himself, and the rulers, laid their hands on the heads of the\r\nsacrifices, and permitted the priests to complete the sacred offices\r\nabout them. So they both slew the sacrifices, and burnt the burnt-\r\nofferings, while the Levites stood round about them, with their musical\r\ninstruments, and sang hymns to God, and played on their psalteries, as\r\nthey were instructed by David to do, and this while the rest of the\r\npriests returned the music, and sounded the trumpets which they had in\r\ntheir hands; and when this was done, the king and the multitude threw\r\nthemselves down upon their face, and worshipped God. He also sacrificed\r\nseventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs. He also granted\r\nthe multitude sacrifices to feast upon, six hundred oxen, and three\r\nthousand other cattle; and the priests performed all things according to\r\nthe law. Now the king was so pleased herewith, that he feasted with the\r\npeople, and returned thanks to God; but as the feast of unleavened bread\r\nwas now come, when they had offered that sacrifice which is called the\r\npassover, they after that offered other sacrifices for seven days. When\r\nthe king had bestowed on the multitude, besides what they sanctified of\r\nthemselves, two thousand bulls, and seven thousand other cattle, the\r\nsame thing was done by the rulers; for they gave them a thousand bulls,\r\nand a thousand and forty other cattle. Nor had this festival been so\r\nwell observed from the days of king Solomon, as it was now first\r\nobserved with great splendor and magnificence; and when the festival was\r\nended, they went out into the country and purged it, and cleansed the\r\ncity of all the pollution of the idols. The king also gave order that\r\nthe daily sacrifices should be offered, at his own charges, and\r\naccording to the law; and appointed that the tithes and the first-fruits\r\nshould be given by the multitude to the priests and Levites, that they\r\nmight constantly attend upon Divine service, and never be taken off from\r\nthe worship of God. Accordingly, the multitude brought together all\r\nsorts of their fruits to the priests and the Levites. The king also made\r\ngarners and receptacles for these fruits, and distributed them to every\r\none of the priests and Levites, and to their children and wives; and\r\nthus did they return to their old form of Divine worship. Now when the\r\nking had settled these matters after the manner already described, he\r\nmade war upon the Philistines, and beat them, and possessed himself of\r\nall the enemy's cities, from Gaza to Gath; but the king of Assyria sent\r\nto him, and threatened to overturn all his dominions, unless he would\r\npay him the tribute which his father paid him formerly; but king\r\nHezekiah was not concerned at his threatenings, but depended on his\r\npiety towards God, and upon Isaiah the prophet, by whom he inquired and\r\naccurately knew all future events. And thus much shall suffice for the\r\npresent concerning this king Hezekiah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. How Shalmaneser Took Samaria By Force And How He\r\nTransplanted The Ten Tribes Into Media, And Brought The Nation Of The\r\nCutheans Into Their Country [In Their Room].\r\n\r\n1. When Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria, had it told him, that [Hoshea]\r\nthe king of Israel had sent privately to So, the king of Egypt, desiring\r\nhis assistance against him, he was very angry, and made an expedition\r\nagainst Samaria, in the seventh year of the reign of Hoshea; but when he\r\nwas not admitted [into the city] by the king, 24 he besieged Samaria\r\nthree years, and took it by force in the ninth year of the reign of\r\nHoshea, and in the seventh year of Hezekiah, king of Jerusalem, and\r\nquite demolished the government of the Israelites, and transplanted all\r\nthe people into Media and Persia among whom he took king Hoshea alive;\r\nand when he had removed these people out of this their land he\r\ntransplanted other nations out of Cuthah, a place so called, [for there\r\nis [still] a river of that name in Persia,] into Samaria, and into the\r\ncountry of the Israelites. So the ten tribes of the Israelites were\r\nremoved out of Judea nine hundred and forty-seven years after their\r\nforefathers were come out of the land of Egypt, and possessed themselves\r\nof the country, but eight hundred years after Joshua had been their\r\nleader, and, as I have already observed, two hundred and forty years,\r\nseven months, and seven days after they had revolted from Rehoboam, the\r\ngrandson of David, and had given the kingdom to Jeroboam. And such a\r\nconclusion overtook the Israelites, when they had transgressed the laws,\r\nand would not hearken to the prophets, who foretold that this calamity\r\nwould come upon them, if they would not leave off their evil doings.\r\nWhat gave birth to these evil doings, was that sedition which they\r\nraised against Rehoboam, the grandson of David, when they set up\r\nJeroboam his servant to be their king, when, by sinning against God, and\r\nbringing them to imitate his bad example, made God to be their enemy,\r\nwhile Jeroboam underwent that punishment which he justly deserved.\r\n\r\n2. And now the king of Assyria invaded all Syria and Phoenicia in a\r\nhostile manner. The name of this king is also set down in the archives\r\nof Tyre, for he made an expedition against Tyre in the reign of Eluleus;\r\nand Menander attests to it, who, when he wrote his Chronology, and\r\ntranslated the archives of Tyre into the Greek language, gives us the\r\nfollowing history: \"One whose name was Eluleus reigned thirty-six years;\r\nthis king, upon the revolt of the Citteans, sailed to them, and reduced\r\nthem again to a submission. Against these did the king of Assyria send\r\nan army, and in a hostile manner overrun all Phoenicia, but soon made\r\npeace with them all, and returned back; but Sidon, and Ace, and\r\nPalsetyrus revolted; and many other cities there were which delivered\r\nthemselves up to the king of Assyria. Accordingly, when the Tyrians\r\nwould not submit to him, the king returned, and fell upon them again,\r\nwhile the Phoenicians had furnished him with threescore ships, and eight\r\nhundred men to row them; and when the Tyrians had come upon them in\r\ntwelve ships, and the enemy's ships were dispersed, they took five\r\nhundred men prisoners, and the reputation of all the citizens of Tyre\r\nwas thereby increased; but the king of Assyria returned, and placed\r\nguards at their rivers and aqueducts, who should hinder the Tyrians from\r\ndrawing water. This continued for five years; and still the Tyrians bore\r\nthe siege, and drank of the water they had out of the wells they dug.\"\r\nAnd this is what is written in the Tyrian archives concerning\r\nShalmaneser, the king of Assyria.\r\n\r\n3. But now the Cutheans, who removed into Samaria, [for that is the name\r\nthey have been called by to this time, because they were brought out of\r\nthe country called Cuthah, which is a country of Persia, and there is a\r\nriver of the same name in it,] each of them, according to their nations,\r\nwhich were in number five, brought their own gods into Samaria, and by\r\nworshipping them, as was the custom of their own countries, they\r\nprovoked Almighty God to be angry and displeased at them, for a plague\r\nseized upon them, by which they were destroyed; and when they found no\r\ncure for their miseries, they learned by the oracle that they ought to\r\nworship Almighty God, as the method for their deliverance. So they sent\r\nambassadors to the king of Assyria, and desired him to send them some of\r\nthose priests of the Israelites whom he had taken captive. And when he\r\nthereupon sent them, and the people were by them taught the laws, and\r\nthe holy worship of God, they worshipped him in a respectful manner, and\r\nthe plague ceased immediately; and indeed they continue to make use of\r\nthe very same customs to this very time, and are called in the Hebrew\r\ntongue Cutlans, but in the Greek tongue Samaritans. And when they see\r\nthe Jews in prosperity, they pretend that they are changed, and allied\r\nto them, and call them kinsmen, as though they were derived from Joseph,\r\nand had by that means an original alliance with them; but when they see\r\nthem falling into a low condition, they say they are no way related to\r\nthem, and that the Jews have no right to expect any kindness or marks of\r\nkindred from them, but they declare that they are sojourners, that come\r\nfrom other countries. But of these we shall have a more seasonable\r\nopportunity to discourse hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ These judges constituted by Jehoshaphat were a kind of\r\nJerusalem Sanhedrim, out of the priests, the Levites, and the principal\r\nof the people, both here and 2 Chronicles 19:8; much like the old\r\nChristian judicatures of the bishop, the presbyters, the deacons, and\r\nthe people.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ Concerning this precious balsam, see the note on Atiq. B.\r\nVIII. ch. 6. sect. 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ What are here Pontus and Thrace, as the places whither\r\nJehoshaphat's fleet sailed, are in our other copies Ophir and Tarshish,\r\nand the place whence it sailed is in them Eziongeber, which lay on the\r\nRed Sea, whence it was impossible for any ships to sail to Pontus or\r\nThrace; so that Josephus's copy differed from our other copies, as is\r\nfurther plain from his own words, which render what we read, that \"the\r\nships were broken at Eziongeber, from their unwieldy greatness.\" But so\r\nfar we may conclude, that Josephus thought one Ophir to be some where in\r\nthe Mediterranean, and not in the South Sea, though perhaps there might\r\nbe another Ophir in that South Sea also, and that fleets might then sail\r\nboth from Phoenicia and from the Red Sea to fetch the gold of Ophir.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ This god of flies seems to have been so called, as was the\r\nlike god among the Greeks, from his supposed power over flies, in\r\ndriving them away from the flesh of their sacrifices, which otherwise\r\nwould have been very troublesome to them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 (return) [ It is commonly esteemed a very cruel action of Elijah, when\r\nhe called for fire from heaven, and consumed no fewer than two captains\r\nand a hundred soldiers, and this for no other crime than obeying the\r\norders of their king, in attempting to seize him; and it is owned by our\r\nSavior, that it was an instance of greater severity than the spirit of\r\nthe New Testament allows, Luke 9:54. But then we must consider that it\r\nis not unlikely that these captains and soldiers believed that they were\r\nsent to fetch the prophet, that he might be put to death for foretelling\r\nthe death of the king, and this while they knew him to be the prophet of\r\nthe true God, the supreme King of Israel, [for they were still under the\r\ntheocracy,] which was no less than impiety, rebellion, and treason, in\r\nthe highest degree: nor would the command of a subaltern, or inferior\r\ncaptain, contradicting the commands of the general, when the captain and\r\nthe soldiers both knew it to be so, as I suppose, justify or excuse such\r\ngross rebellion and disobedience in soldiers at this day. Accordingly,\r\nwhen Saul commanded his guards to slay Ahimelech and the priests at Nob,\r\nthey knew it to be an unlawful command, and would not obey it, 1 Samuel\r\n22:17. From which cases both officers and soldiers may learn, that the\r\ncommands of their leaders or kings cannot justify or excuse them in\r\ndoing what is wicked in the sight of God, or in fighting in an unjust\r\ncause, when they know it so to be.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 (return) [ This practice of cutting down, or plucking up by the roots,\r\nthe fruit trees was forbidden, even in ordinary wars, by the law of\r\nMoses, Deuteronomy 20:19, 20, and only allowed by God in this particular\r\ncase, when the Moabites were to be punished and cut off in an\r\nextraordinary manner for their wickedness See Jeremiah 48:11-13, and\r\nmany the like prophecies against them. Nothing could therefore justify\r\nthis practice but a particular commission from God by his prophet, as in\r\nthe present case, which was ever a sufficient warrant for breaking any\r\nsuch ritual or ceremonial law whatsoever.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 (return) [ That this woman who cried to Elisha, and who in our Bible\r\nis styled \"the wife of one of the sons of the prophets,\" 2 Kings 4:1,\r\nwas no other than the widow of Obadiah, the good steward of Ahab, is\r\nconfirmed by the Chaldee paraphrast, and by the Rabbins and others. Nor\r\nis that unlikely which Josephus here adds, that these debts were\r\ncontracted by her husband for the support of those \"hundred of the\r\nLord's prophets, whom he maintained by fifty in a cave,\" in the days of\r\nAhab and Jezebel, 1 Kings 18:4; which circumstance rendered it highly\r\nfit that the prophet Elisha should provide her a remedy, and enable her\r\nto redeem herself and her sons from the fear of that slavery which\r\ninsolvent debtors were liable to by the law of Moses, Leviticus 25:39;\r\nMatthew 18:25; which he did accordingly, with God's help, at the expense\r\nof a miracle.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8 (return) [ Dr. Hudson, with very good reason, suspects that there is\r\nno small defect in our present copies of Josephus, just before the\r\nbeginning of this section, and that chiefly as to that distinct account\r\nwhich he had given us reason to expect in the first section, and to\r\nwhich he seems to refer, ch. 8. sect. 6. concerning the glorious\r\nmiracles which Elisha wrought, which indeed in our Bibles are not a few,\r\n2 Kings 6-9., but of which we have several omitted in Josephus's present\r\ncopies. One of those histories, omitted at present, was evidently in his\r\nBible, I mean that of the curing of Nanman's leprosy, 2 Kings 5.; for he\r\nplainly alludes to it, B. III. ch. 11. sect. 4, where he observes, that\r\n\"there were lepers in many nations who yet have been in honor, and not\r\nonly free from reproach and avoidance, but who have been great captains\r\nof armies, and been intrusted with high offices in the commonwealth, and\r\nhave had the privilege of entering into holy places and temples.\" But\r\nwhat makes me most regret the want of that history in our present copies\r\nof Josephus is this, that we have here, as it is commonly understood,\r\none of the greatest difficulties in all the Bible, that in 2 Kings 5:18,\r\n19, where Naaman, after he had been miraculously cured by a prophet of\r\nthe true God, and had thereupon promised [ver. 17: that \"he would\r\nhenceforth offer neither burnt-offering nor sacrifice unto other gods,\r\nbut unto the Lord,\" adds, \"In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant,\r\nthat when my master goeth into the house of Rimnu to worship there, and\r\nhe leaneth on my hands, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmort; when I\r\nbow down myself in the house of Rimmort, the Lord pardon thy servant in\r\nthis thing.

Nor does it\r\nseem to me otherwise but that Benhadad immediately recovered of his\r\ndisease, as the prophet foretold; and that Hazael, upon his being\r\nanointed to succeed him though he ought to have staid till he died by\r\nthe course of nature, or some other way of Divine punishment, as did\r\nDavid for many years in the like case, was too impatient, and the very\r\nnext day smothered or strangled him, in order to come directly to the\r\nsuccession.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13 (return) [ What Mr. Le Clerc pretends here, that it is more probable\r\nthat Hazael and his son were worshipped by the Syrians and people of\r\nDamascus till the days of Josephus, than Benhadad and Hazael, because\r\nunder Benhadad they had greatly suffered, and because it is almost\r\nincredible that both a king and that king's murderer should be\r\nworshipped by the same Syrians, is of little force against those\r\nrecords, out of which Josephus drew this history, especially when it is\r\nlikely that they thought Benhadad died of the distemper he labored\r\nunder, and not by Hazael's treachery. Besides, the reason that Josephus\r\ngives for this adoration, that these two kings had been great\r\nbenefactors to the inhabitants of Damascus, and had built them temples,\r\nis too remote from the political suspicions of Le Clerc; nor ought such\r\nweak suspicions to be deemed of any force against authentic testimonies\r\nof antiquity.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14 (return) [ This epistle, in some copies of Josephus, is said to come\r\nto Jotare from Elijah, with this addition,\" for he was yet upon earth,\"\r\nwhich could not be true of Elijah, who, as all agree, was gone from the\r\nearth about four years before, and could only be true of Elisha; nor\r\nperhaps is there any more mystery here, than that the name of Elijah has\r\nvery anciently crept into the text instead of Elisha, by the copiers,\r\nthere being nothing in any copy of that epistle peculiar to Elijah.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15 (return) [ Spanheim here notes, that this putting off men's garments,\r\nand strewing them under a king, was an Eastern custom, which he had\r\nelsewhere explained.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 (return) [ Our copies say that this \"driving of the chariots was like\r\nthe driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously,\" 2\r\nKings 9:20; whereas Josephus's copy, as he understood it, was this,\r\nthat, on the contrary, Jehu marched slowly, and in good order. Nor can\r\nit be denied, that since there was interval enough for king Joram to\r\nsend out two horsemen, one after another, to Jehu, and at length to go\r\nout with king Ahaziah to meet him, and all this after he was come within\r\nsight of the watchman, and before he was come to Jezreel, the\r\nprobability is greatly on the side of Josephus's copy or\r\ninterpretation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n17 (return) [ This character of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, that \"he was\r\na good man, and in his disposition not at all like to his father,\" seems\r\na direct contradiction to our ordinary copies, which say [2 Kings 13:11]\r\nthat \"he did evil in the sight of the Lord; and that he departed not\r\nfrom all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:\r\nhe walked therein.\" Which copies are here the truest it is hard\r\npositively to determine. If Josephus's be true, this Joash is the single\r\ninstance of a good king over the ten tribes; if the other be true, we\r\nhave not one such example. The account that follows, in all copies, of\r\nElisha the prophet's concern for him, and his concern for Elisha,\r\ngreatly favors Josephus's copies, and supposes this king to have been\r\nthen a good man, and no idolater, with whom God's prophets used not to\r\nbe so familiar. Upon the whole, since it appears, even by Josephus's own\r\naccount, that Amaziah, the good king of Judah, while he was a good king,\r\nwas forbidden to make use of the hundred thousand auxiliaries he had\r\nhired of this Joash, the king of Israel, as if he and they were then\r\nidolaters, 2 Chronicles 25:6-9, it is most likely that these different\r\ncharacters of Joash suited the different parts of his reign, and that,\r\naccording to our common copies, he was at first a wicked king, and\r\nafterwards was reclaimed, and became a good one, according to Josephus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n18 (return) [ What I have above noted concerning Jehoash, seems to me to\r\nhave been true also concerning his son Jeroboam II., viz. that although\r\nhe began wickedly, as Josephus agrees with our other copies, and, as he\r\nadds, \"was the cause of a vast number of misfortunes to the Israelites\"\r\nin those his first years, [the particulars of which are unhappily\r\nwanting both in Josephus and in all our copies,] so does it seem to me\r\nthat he was afterwards reclaimed, and became a good king, and so was\r\nencouraged by the prophet Jonah, and had great successes afterward, when\r\n\"God had saved the Israelites by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of\r\nJoash,\" 2 Kings 14:27; which encouragement by Jonah, and great\r\nsuccesses, are equally observable in Josephus, and in the other copies.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19 (return) [ When Jonah is said in our Bibles to have gone to Tarshish,\r\nJonah 1:3, Josephus understood it that he went to Tarsus in Cilicia, or\r\nto the Mediterranean Sea, upon which Tarsus lay; so that he does not\r\nappear to have read the text, 1 Kings 22:48, as our copies do, that\r\nships of Tarshish could lie at Ezion-geber, upon the Red Sea. But as to\r\nJosephus's assertion, that Jonah's fish was carried by the strength of\r\nthe current, upon a nean, it is by no means an improbable determination\r\nin Josephus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20 (return) [ This ancient piece of religion, of supposing there was\r\ngreat sin where there was great misery, and of casting lots to discover\r\ngreat sinners, not only among the Israelites, but among these heathen\r\nmariners, seems a remarkable remains of the ancient tradition which\r\nprevailed of old over all mankind, that Providence used to interpose\r\nvisibly in all human affairs, and storm, as far as the Euxine Sea, it is\r\nno way impossible; and since the storm might have driven the ship, while\r\nJonah was in it never to bring, or at least not long to continue,\r\nnotorious judge, near to that Euxine Sea, and since in three more days,\r\nwhile but for notorious sins, which the most ancient Book of he was in\r\nthe fish's belly, that current might bring him to the Job shows to have\r\nbeen the state of mankind for about the Assyrian coast, and since withal\r\nthat coast could bring him former three thousand years of the world,\r\ntill the days of Job nearer to Nineveh than could any coast of the\r\nMediterranian and Moses.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21 (return) [ This account of an earthquake at Jerusalem at the very\r\nsame time when Uzziah usurped the priest's office, and went into the\r\nsanctuary to burn incense, and of the consequences of the earthquake, is\r\nentirely wanting in our other copies, though it be exceeding like to a\r\nprophecy of Jeremiah, now in Zechariah 14:4, 5; in which prophecy\r\nmention is made of \"fleeing from that earthquake, as they fled from this\r\nearthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah;\" so that there seems to\r\nhave been some considerable resemblance between these historical and\r\nprophetical earthquakes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n22 (return) [ Dr. Wall, in his critical notes on 2 Kings 15:20,\r\nobserves, \"that when this Menahem is said to have exacted the money of\r\nIsrael of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of\r\nsilver, to give Pul, the king of Assyria, a thousand talents, this is\r\nthe first public money raised by any [Israelite] king by tax on the\r\npeople; that they used before to raise it out of the treasures of the\r\nhouse of the Lord, or of their own house; that it was a poll-money on\r\nthe rich men, [and them only,] to raise oe353,000, or, as others count a\r\ntalent, oe400,000, at the rate of oe6 or oe7 per head; and that God\r\ncommanded, by Ezekiel, ch. 45:8; 46:18, that no such thing should be\r\ndone [at the Jews' restoration], but the king should have land of his\r\nown.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n23 (return) [ This passage is taken out of the prophet Nahum, ch. 2:8-\r\n13, and is the principal, or rather the only, one that is given us\r\nalmost verbatim, but a little abridged, in all Josephus's known\r\nwritings: by which quotation we learn what he himself always asserts,\r\nviz. that he made use of the Hebrew original and not of the Greek\r\nversion]; as also we learn, that his Hebrew copy considerably differed\r\nfrom ours.

Containing The Interval Of One Hundred And Eighty-Two Years And\r\nA Half.—From The Captivity Of The Ten Tribes To The First Year Of Cyrus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. How Sennacherib Made An Expedition Against Hezekiah; What\r\nThreatenings Rabshakeh Made To Hezekiah When Sennacherib Was Gone\r\nAgainst The Egyptians; How Isaiah The Prophet Encouraged Him; How\r\nSennacherib Having Failed Of Success In Egypt, Returned Thence To\r\nJerusalem; And How Upon His Finding His Army Destroyed, He Returned\r\nHome; And What Befell Him A Little Afterward.\r\n\r\n1. It was now the fourteenth year of the government of Hezekiah, king of\r\nthe two tribes, when the king of Assyria, whose name was Sennacherib,\r\nmade an expedition against him with a great army, and took all the\r\ncities of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin by force; and when he was\r\nready to bring his army against Jerusalem, Hezekiah sent ambassadors to\r\nhim beforehand, and promised to submit, and pay what tribute he should\r\nappoint. Hereupon Sennacherib, when he heard of what offers the\r\nambassadors made, resolved not to proceed in the war, but to accept of\r\nthe proposals that were made him; and if he might receive three hundred\r\ntalents of silver, and thirty talents of gold, he promised that he would\r\ndepart in a friendly manner; and he gave security upon oath to the\r\nambassadors that he would then do him no harm, but go away as he came.\r\nSo Hezekiah submitted, and emptied his treasures, and sent the money, as\r\nsupposing he should be freed from his enemy, and from any further\r\ndistress about his kingdom. Accordingly, the Assyrian king took it, and\r\nyet had no regard to what he had promised; but while he himself went to\r\nthe war against the Egyptians and Ethiopians, he left his general\r\nRabshakeh, and two other of his principal commanders, with great forces,\r\nto destroy Jerusalem. The names of the two other commanders were Tartan\r\nand Rabsaris.\r\n\r\n2. Now as soon as they were come before the walls, they pitched their\r\ncamp, and sent messengers to Hezekiah, and desired that they might speak\r\nwith him; but he did not himself come out to them for fear, but he sent\r\nthree of his most intimate friends; the name of one was Eliakim, who was\r\nover the kingdom, and Shebna, and Joah the recorder. So these men came\r\nout, and stood over against the commanders of the Assyrian army; and\r\nwhen Rabshakeh saw them, he bid them go and speak to Hezekiah in the\r\nmanner following: That Sennacherib, the great king, 1 desires to know of\r\nhim, on whom it is that he relies and depends, in flying from his lord,\r\nand will not hear him, nor admit his army into the city? Is it on\r\naccount of the Egyptians, and in hopes that his army would be beaten by\r\nthem? Whereupon he lets him know, that if this be what he expects, he is\r\na foolish man, and like one who leans on a broken reed; while such a one\r\nwill not only fall down, but will have his hand pierced and hurt by it.\r\nThat he ought to know he makes this expedition against him by the will\r\nof God, who hath granted this favor to him, that he shall overthrow the\r\nkingdom of Israel, and that in the very same manner he shall destroy\r\nthose that are his subjects also. When Rabshakeh had made this speech in\r\nthe Hebrew tongue, for he was skillful in that language, Eliakim was\r\nafraid lest the multitude that heard him should be disturbed; so he\r\ndesired him to speak in the Syrian tongue. But the general,\r\nunderstanding what he meant, and perceiving the fear that he was in, he\r\nmade his answer with a greater and a louder voice, but in the Hebrew\r\ntongue; and said, that \"since they all heard what were the king's\r\ncommands, they would consult their own advantage in delivering up\r\nthemselves to us; for it is plain the both you and your king dissuade\r\nthe people from submitting by vain hopes, and so induce them to resist;\r\nbut if you be courageous, and think to drive our forces away, I am ready\r\nto deliver to you two thousand of these horses that are with me for your\r\nuse, if you can set as many horsemen on their backs, and show your\r\nstrength; but what you have not you cannot produce. Why therefore do you\r\ndelay to deliver up yourselves to a superior force, who can take you\r\nwithout your consent? although it will be safer for you to deliver\r\nyourselves up voluntarily, while a forcible capture, when you are\r\nbeaten, must appear more dangerous, and will bring further calamities\r\nupon you.\"\r\n\r\n3. When the people, as well as the ambassadors, heard what the Assyrian\r\ncommander said, they related it to Hezekiah, who thereupon put off his\r\nroyal apparel, and clothed himself with sackcloth, and took the habit of\r\na mourner, and, after the manner of his country, he fell upon his face,\r\nand besought God, and entreated him to assist them, now they had no\r\nother hope of relief. He also sent some of his friends, and some of the\r\npriests, to the prophet Isaiah, and desired that he would pray to God,\r\nand offer sacrifices for their common deliverance, and so put up\r\nsupplications to him, that he would have indignation at the expectations\r\nof their enemies, and have mercy upon his people. And when the prophet\r\nhad done accordingly, an oracle came from God to him, and encouraged the\r\nking and his friends that were about him; and foretold that their\r\nenemies should be beaten without fighting, and should go away in an\r\nignominious manner, and not with that insolence which they now show, for\r\nthat God would take care that they should be destroyed. He also foretold\r\nthat Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, should fail of his purpose\r\nagainst Egypt, and that when he came home he should perish by the sword.\r\n\r\n4. About the same time also the king of Assyria wrote an epistle to\r\nHezekiah, in which he said he was a foolish man, in supposing that he\r\nshould escape from being his servant, since he had already brought under\r\nmany and great nations; and he threatened, that when he took him, he\r\nwould utterly destroy him, unless he now opened the gates, and willingly\r\nreceived his army into Jerusalem. When he read this epistle, he despised\r\nit, on account of the trust that he had in God; but he rolled up the\r\nepistle, and laid it up within the temple. And as he made his further\r\nprayers to God for the city, and for the preservation of all the people,\r\nthe prophet Isaiah said that God had heard his prayer, and that he\r\nshould not be besieged at this time by the king of Assyria 2 that for\r\nthe future he might be secure of not being at all disturbed by him; and\r\nthat the people might go on peaceably, and without fear, with their\r\nhusbandry and other affairs. But after a little while the king of\r\nAssyria, when he had failed of his treacherous designs against the\r\nEgyptians, returned home without success, on the following occasion: He\r\nspent a long time in the siege of Pelusium; and when the banks that he\r\nhad raised over against the walls were of a great height, and when he\r\nwas ready to make an immediate assault upon them, but heard that\r\nTirhaka, king of the Ethiopians, was coming and bringing great forces to\r\naid the Egyptians, and was resolved to march through the desert, and so\r\nto fall directly upon the Assyrians, this king Sennacherib was disturbed\r\nat the news, and, as I said before, left Pelusium, and returned back\r\nwithout success. Now concerning this Sennacherib, Herodotus also says,\r\nin the second book of his histories, how \"this king came against the\r\nEgyptian king, who was the priest of Vulcan; and that as he was\r\nbesieging Pelusium, he broke up the siege on the following occasion:\r\nThis Egyptian priest prayed to God, and God heard his prayer, and sent a\r\njudgment upon the Arabian king.\" But in this Herodotus was mistaken,\r\nwhen he called this king not king of the Assyrians, but of the Arabians;\r\nfor he saith that \"a multitude of mice gnawed to pieces in one night\r\nboth the bows and the rest of the armor of the Assyrians, and that it\r\nwas on that account that the king, when he had no bows left, drew off\r\nhis army from Pelusium.\" And Herodotus does indeed give us this history;\r\nnay, and Berosus, who wrote of the affairs of Chaldea, makes mention of\r\nthis king Sennacherib, and that he ruled over the Assyrians, and that he\r\nmade an expedition against all Asia and Egypt; and says thus:\r\n\r\n5. \"Now when Sennacherib was returning from his Egyptian war to\r\nJerusalem, he found his army under Rabshakeh his general in danger [by a\r\nplague], for God had sent a pestilential distemper upon his army; and on\r\nthe very first night of the siege, a hundred fourscore and five\r\nthousand, with their captains and generals, were destroyed. So the king\r\nwas in a great dread and in a terrible agony at this calamity; and being\r\nin great fear for his whole army, he fled with the rest of his forces to\r\nhis own kingdom, and to his city Nineveh; and when he had abode there a\r\nlittle while, he was treacherously assaulted, and died by the hands of\r\nhis elder sons, 3 Adrammelech and Seraser, and was slain in his own\r\ntemple, which was called Araske. Now these sons of his were driven away\r\non account of the murder of their father by the citizens, and went into\r\nArmenia, while Assarachoddas took the kingdom of Sennacherib.\" And this\r\nproved to be the conclusion of this Assyrian expedition against the\r\npeople of Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How Hezekiah Was Sick, And Ready To Die; And How God Bestowed\r\nUpon Him Fifteen Years Longer Life, [And Secured That Promise] By The\r\nGoing Back Of The Shadow Ten Degrees.\r\n\r\n1. Now king Hezekiah being thus delivered, after a surprising manner,\r\nfrom the dread he was in, offered thank-offerings to God, with all his\r\npeople, because nothing else had destroyed some of their enemies, and\r\nmade the rest so fearful of undergoing the same fate that they departed\r\nfrom Jerusalem, but that Divine assistance. Yet, while he was very\r\nzealous and diligent about the worship of God, did he soon afterwards\r\nfall into a severe distemper, insomuch that the physicians despaired of\r\nhim, and expected no good issue of his sickness, as neither did his\r\nfriends: and besides the distemper 4 itself, there was a very melancholy\r\ncircumstance that disordered the king, which was the consideration that\r\nhe was childless, and was going to die, and leave his house and his\r\ngovernment without a successor of his own body; so he was troubled at\r\nthe thoughts of this his condition, and lamented himself, and entreated\r\nof God that he would prolong his life for a little while till he had\r\nsome children, and not suffer him to depart this life before he was\r\nbecome a father. Hereupon God had mercy upon him, and accepted of his\r\nsupplication, because the trouble he was under at his supposed death was\r\nnot because he was soon to leave the advantages he enjoyed in the\r\nkingdom, nor did he on that account pray that he might have a longer\r\nlife afforded him, but in order to have sons, that might receive the\r\ngovernment after him. And God sent Isaiah the prophet, and commanded him\r\nto inform Hezekiah, that within three days' time he should get clear of\r\nhis distemper, and should survive it fifteen years, and that he should\r\nhave children also. Now, upon the prophet's saying this, as God had\r\ncommanded him, he could hardly believe it, both on account of the\r\ndistemper he was under, which was very sore, and by reason of the\r\nsurprising nature of what was told him; so he desired that Isaiah would\r\ngive him some sign or wonder, that he might believe him in what he had\r\nsaid, and be sensible that he came from God; for things that are beyond\r\nexpectation, and greater than our hopes, are made credible by actions of\r\nthe like nature. And when Isaiah had asked him what sign he desired to\r\nbe exhibited, he desired that he would make the shadow of the sun, which\r\nhe had already made to go down ten steps [or degrees] in his house, to\r\nreturn again to the same place, 5 and to make it as it was before. And\r\nwhen the prophet prayed to God to exhibit this sign to the king, he saw\r\nwhat he desired to see, and was freed from his distemper, and went up to\r\nthe temple, where he worshipped God, and made vows to him.\r\n\r\n2. At this time it was that the dominion of the Assyrians was overthrown\r\nby the Medes; 6 but of these things I shall treat elsewhere. But the\r\nking of Babylon, whose name was Baladan, sent ambassadors to Hezekiah,\r\nwith presents, and desired he would be his ally and his friend. So he\r\nreceived the ambassadors gladly, and made them a feast, and showed them\r\nhis treasures, and his armory, and the other wealth he was possessed of,\r\nin precious stones and in gold, and gave them presents to be carried to\r\nBaladan, and sent them back to him. Upon which the prophet Isaiah came\r\nto him, and inquired of him whence those ambassadors came; to which he\r\nreplied, that they came from Babylon, from the king; and that he had\r\nshowed them all he had, that by the sight of his riches and forces he\r\nmight thereby guess at [the plenty he was in], and be able to inform the\r\nking of it. But the prophet rejoined, and said, \"Know thou, that, after\r\na little while, these riches of thine shall be carried away to Babylon,\r\nand thy posterity shall be made eunuchs there, and lose their manhood,\r\nand be servants to the king of Babylon; for that God foretold such\r\nthings would come to pass.\" Upon which words Hezekiah was troubled, and\r\nsaid that he was himself unwilling that his nation should fall into such\r\ncalamities; yet since it is not possible to alter what God had\r\ndetermined, he prayed that there might be peace while he lived. Berosus\r\nalso makes mention of this Baladan, king of Babylon. Now as to this\r\nprophet [Isaiah], he was by the confession of all, a divine and\r\nwonderful man in speaking truth; and out of the assurance that he had\r\nnever written what was false, he wrote down all his prophecies, and left\r\nthem behind him in books, that their accomplishment might be judged of\r\nfrom the events by posterity: nor did this prophet do so alone, but the\r\nothers, which were twelve in number, did the same. And whatsoever is\r\ndone among us, Whether it be good, or whether it be bad, comes to pass\r\naccording to their prophecies; but of every one of these we shall speak\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How Manasseh Reigned After Hezekiah; And How When He Was In\r\nCaptivity He Returned To God And Was Restored To His Kingdom And Left It\r\nTo [His Son] Amon.\r\n\r\n1. When king Hezekiah had survived the interval of time already\r\nmentioned, and had dwelt all that time in peace, he died, having\r\ncompleted fifty-four years of his life, and reigned twenty-nine. But\r\nwhen his son Manasseh, whose mother's name was Hephzibah, of Jerusalem,\r\nhad taken the kingdom, he departed from the conduct of his father, and\r\nfell into a course of life quite contrary thereto, and showed himself in\r\nhis manners most wicked in all respects, and omitted no sort of impiety,\r\nbut imitated those transgressions of the Israelites, by the commission\r\nof which against God they had been destroyed; for he was so hardy as to\r\ndefile the temple of God, and the city, and the whole country; for, by\r\nsetting out from a contempt of God, he barbarously slew all the\r\nrighteous men that were among the Hebrews; nor would he spare the\r\nprophets, for he every day slew some of them, till Jerusalem was\r\noverflown with blood. So God was angry at these proceedings, and sent\r\nprophets to the king, and to the multitude, by whom he threatened the\r\nvery same calamities to them which their brethren the Israelites, upon\r\nthe like affronts offered to God, were now under. But these men would\r\nnot believe their words, by which belief they might have reaped the\r\nadvantage of escaping all those miseries; yet did they in earnest learn\r\nthat what the prophets had told them was true.\r\n\r\n2. And when they persevered in the same course of life, God raised up\r\nwar against them from the king of Babylon and Chaldea, who sent an army\r\nagainst Judea, and laid waste the country; and caught king Manasseh by\r\ntreachery, and ordered him to be brought to him, and had him under his\r\npower to inflict what punishment he pleased upon him. But then it was\r\nthat Manasseh perceived what a miserable condition he was in, and\r\nesteeming himself the cause of all, he besought God to render his enemy\r\nhumane and merciful to him. Accordingly, God heard his prayer, and\r\ngranted him what he prayed for. So Manasseh was released by the king of\r\nBabylon, and escaped the danger he was in; and when he was come to\r\nJerusalem, he endeavored, if it were possible, to cast out of his memory\r\nthose his former sins against God, of which he now repented, and to\r\napply himself to a very religious life. He sanctified the temple, and\r\npurged the city, and for the remainder of his days he was intent on\r\nnothing but to return his thanks to God for his deliverance, and to\r\npreserve him propitious to him all his life long. He also instructed the\r\nmultitude to do the same, as having very nearly experienced what a\r\ncalamity he was fallen into by a contrary conduct. He also rebuilt the\r\naltar, and offered the legal sacrifices, as Moses commanded. And when he\r\nhad re-established what concerned the Divine worship, as it ought to be,\r\nhe took care of the security of Jerusalem: he did not only repair the\r\nold walls with great diligence, but added another wall to the former. He\r\nalso built very lofty towers, and the garrisoned places before the city\r\nhe strengthened, not only in other respects, but with provisions of all\r\nsorts that they wanted. And indeed, when he had changed his former\r\ncourse, he so led his life for the time to come, that from the time of\r\nhis return to piety towards God he was deemed a happy man, and a pattern\r\nfor imitation. When therefore he had lived sixty-seven years, he\r\ndeparted this life, having reigned fifty-five years, and was buried in\r\nhis own garden; and the kingdom came to his son Amon, whose mother's\r\nname was Meshulemeth, of the city of Jotbath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How Amon Reigned Instead Of Manasseh; And After Amon Reigned\r\nJosiah; He Was Both Righteous And Religious. As Also Concerning Huldah\r\nThe Prophetess.\r\n\r\n1. This Amon imitated those works of his father which he insolently did\r\nwhen he was young: so he had a conspiracy made against him by his own\r\nservants, and was slain in his own house, when he had lived twenty-four\r\nyears, and of them had reigned two. But the multitude punished those\r\nthat slew Amon, and buried him with his father, and gave the kingdom to\r\nhis son Josiah, who was eight years old. His mother was of the city of\r\nBoscath, and her name was Jedidah. He was of a most excellent\r\ndisposition, and naturally virtuous, and followed the actions of king\r\nDavid, as a pattern and a rule to him in the whole conduct of his life.\r\nAnd when he was twelve years old, he gave demonstrations of his\r\nreligious and righteous behavior; for he brought the people to a sober\r\nway of living, and exhorted them to leave off the opinion they had of\r\ntheir idols, because they were not gods, but to worship their own God.\r\nAnd by repeating on the actions of his progenitors, he prudently\r\ncorrected what they did wrong, like a very elderly man, and like one\r\nabundantly able to understand what was fit to be done; and what he found\r\nthey had well done, he observed all the country over, and imitated the\r\nsame. And thus he acted in following the wisdom and sagacity of his own\r\nnature, and in compliance with the advice and instruction of the elders;\r\nfor by following the laws it was that he succeeded so well in the order\r\nof his government, and in piety with regard to the Divine worship. And\r\nthis happened because the transgressions of the former kings were seen\r\nno more, but quite vanished away; for the king went about the city, and\r\nthe whole country, and cut down the groves which were devoted to strange\r\ngods, and overthrew their altars; and if there were any gifts dedicated\r\nto them by his forefathers, he made them ignominious, and plucked them\r\ndown; and by this means he brought the people back from their opinion\r\nabout them to the worship of God. He also offered his accustomed\r\nsacrifices and burnt- offerings upon the altar. Moreover, he ordained\r\ncertain judges and overseers, that they might order the matters to them\r\nseverally belonging, and have regard to justice above all things, and\r\ndistribute it with the same concern they would have about their own\r\nsoul. He also sent over all the country, and desired such as pleased to\r\nbring gold and silver for the repairs of the temple, according to every\r\none's inclinations and abilities. And when the money was brought in, he\r\nmade one Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Shaphan the scribe, and\r\nJoab the recorder, and Eliakim the high priest, curators of the temple,\r\nand of the charges contributed thereto; who made no delay, nor put the\r\nwork off at all, but prepared architects, and whatsoever was proper for\r\nthose repairs, and set closely about the work. So the temple was\r\nrepaired by this means, and became a public demonstration of the king's\r\npiety.\r\n\r\n2. But when he was now in the eighteenth year of his reign, he sent to\r\nEliakim the high priest, and gave order, that out of what money was\r\noverplus, he should cast cups, and dishes, and vials, for ministration\r\n[in the temple]; and besides, that they should bring all the gold or\r\nsilver which was among the treasures, and expend that also in making\r\ncups and the like vessels. But as the high priest was bringing out the\r\ngold, he lighted upon the holy books of Moses that were laid up in the\r\ntemple; and when he had brought them out, he gave them to Shaphan the\r\nscribe, who, when he had read them, came to the king, and informed him\r\nthat all was finished which he had ordered to be done. He also read over\r\nthe books to him, who, when he had heard them read, rent his garment,\r\nand called for Eliakim the high priest, and for [Shaphan] the scribe,\r\nand for certain [other] of his most particular friends, and sent them to\r\nHuldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, [which Shallum was a man of\r\ndignity, and of an eminent family,] and bid them go to her, and say that\r\n[he desired] she would appease God, and endeavor to render him\r\npropitious to them, for that there was cause to fear, lest, upon the\r\ntransgression of the laws of Moses by their forefathers, they should be\r\nin peril of going into captivity, and of being cast out of their own\r\ncountry; lest they should be in want of all things, and so end their\r\ndays miserably. When the prophetess had heard this from the messengers\r\nthat were sent to her by the king, she bid them go back to the king, and\r\nsay that \"God had already given sentence against them, to destroy the\r\npeople, and cast them out of their country, and deprive them of all the\r\nhappiness they enjoyed;\" which sentence none could set aside by any\r\nprayers of theirs, since it was passed on account of their\r\ntransgressions of the laws, and of their not having repented in so long\r\na time, while the prophets had exhorted them to amend, and had foretold\r\nthe punishment that would ensue on their impious practices; which\r\nthreatening God would certainly execute upon them, that they might be\r\npersuaded that he is God, and had not deceived them in any respect as to\r\nwhat he had denounced by his prophets; that yet, because Josiah was a\r\nrighteous man, he would at present delay those calamities, but that\r\nafter his death he would send on the multitude what miseries he had\r\ndetermined for them.\r\n\r\n3. So these messengers, upon this prophecy of the woman, came and told\r\nit to the king; whereupon he sent to the people every where, and ordered\r\nthat the priests and the Levites should come together to Jerusalem; and\r\ncommanded that those of every age should be present also. And when they\r\nhad gathered together, he first read to them the holy books; after which\r\nhe stood upon a pulpit, in the midst of the multitude, and obliged them\r\nto make a covenant, with an oath, that they would worship God, and keep\r\nthe laws of Moses. Accordingly, they gave their assent willingly, and\r\nundertook to do what the king had recommended to them. So they\r\nimmediately offered sacrifices, and that after an acceptable manner, and\r\nbesought God to be gracious and merciful to them. He also enjoined the\r\nhigh priest, that if there remained in the temple any vessel that was\r\ndedicated to idols, or to foreign gods, they should cast it out. So when\r\na great number of such vessels were got together, he burnt them, and\r\nscattered their ashes abroad, and slew the priests of the idols that\r\nwere not of the family of Aaron.\r\n\r\n4. And when he had done thus in Jerusalem, he came into the country, and\r\nutterly destroyed what buildings had been made therein by king Jeroboam,\r\nin honor of strange gods; and he burnt the bones of the false prophets\r\nupon that altar which Jeroboam first built; and, as the prophet [Jadon],\r\nwho came to Jeroboam when he was offering sacrifice, and when all the\r\npeople heard him, foretold what would come to pass, viz. that a certain\r\nman of the house of David, Josiah by name, should do what is here\r\nmentioned. And it happened that those predictions took effect after\r\nthree hundred and sixty-one years.\r\n\r\n5. After these things, Josiah went also to such other Israelites as had\r\nescaped captivity and slavery under the Assyrians, and persuaded them to\r\ndesist from their impious practices, and to leave off the honors they\r\npaid to strange gods, but to worship rightly their own Almighty God, and\r\nadhere to him. He also searched the houses, and the villages, and the\r\ncities, out of a suspicion that somebody might have one idol or other in\r\nprivate; nay, indeed, he took away the chariots [of the sun] that were\r\nset up in his royal palace, 7 which his predecessors had framed, and\r\nwhat thing soever there was besides which they worshipped as a god. And\r\nwhen he had thus purged all the country, he called the people to\r\nJerusalem, and there celebrated the feast of unleavened bread, and that\r\ncalled the passover. He also gave the people for paschal sacrifices,\r\nyoung kids of the goats, and lambs, thirty thousand, and three thousand\r\noxen for burnt-offerings. The principal of the priests also gave to the\r\npriests against the passover two thousand and six hundred lambs; the\r\nprincipal of the Levites also gave to the Levites five thousand lambs,\r\nand five hundred oxen, by which means there was great plenty of\r\nsacrifices; and they offered those sacrifices according to the laws of\r\nMoses, while every priest explained the matter, and ministered to the\r\nmultitude. And indeed there had been no other festival thus celebrated\r\nby the Hebrews from the times of Samuel the prophet; and the plenty of\r\nsacrifices now was the occasion that all things were performed according\r\nto the laws, and according to the custom of their forefathers. So when\r\nJosiah had after this lived in peace, nay, in riches and reputation\r\nalso, among all men, he ended his life in the manner following.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How Josiah Fought With Neco [King Of Egypt.] And Was Wounded\r\nAnd Died In A Little Time Afterward; As Also How Neco Carried Jehoahaz,\r\nWho Had Been Made King Into Egypt And Delivered The Kingdom To\r\nJehoiakim; And [Lastly] Concerning Jeremiah And Ezekiel.\r\n\r\n1. Now Neco, king of Egypt, raised an army, and marched to the river\r\nEuphrates, in order to fight with the Medes and Babylonians, who had\r\noverthrown the dominion of the Assyrians, 8 for he had a desire to reign\r\nover Asia. Now when he was come to the city Mendes, which belonged to\r\nthe kingdom of Josiah, he brought an army to hinder him from passing\r\nthrough his own country, in his expedition against the Medes. Now Neco\r\nsent a herald to Josiah, and told him that he did not make this\r\nexpedition against him, but was making haste to Euphrates; and desired\r\nthat he would not provoke him to fight against him, because he\r\nobstructed his march to the place whither he had resolved to go. But\r\nJosiah did not admit of this advice of Neco, but put himself into a\r\nposture to hinder him from his intended march. I suppose it was fate\r\nthat pushed him on this conduct, that it might take an occasion against\r\nhim; for as he was setting his army in array, 9 and rode about in his\r\nchariot, from one wing of his army to another, one of the Egyptians shot\r\nan arrow at him, and put an end to his eagerness of fighting; for being\r\nsorely wounded, he command a retreat to be sounded for his army, and\r\nreturned to Jerusalem, and died of that wound; and was magnificently\r\nburied in the sepulcher of his fathers, when he had lived thirty-nine\r\nyears, and of them had reigned thirty-one. But all the people mourned\r\ngreatly for him, lamenting and grieving on his account many days; and\r\nJeremiah the prophet composed an elegy to lament him, 10 which is extant\r\ntill this time also. Moreover, this prophet denounced beforehand the sad\r\ncalamities that were coming upon the city. He also left behind him in\r\nwriting a description of that destruction of our nation which has lately\r\nhappened in our days, and the taking of Babylon; nor was he the only\r\nprophet who delivered such predictions beforehand to the multitude, but\r\nso did Ezekiel also, who was the first person that wrote, and left\r\nbehind him in writing two books concerning these events. Now these two\r\nprophets were priests by birth, but of them Jeremiah dwelt in Jerusalem,\r\nfrom the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah, until the city and\r\ntemple were utterly destroyed. However, as to what befell this prophet,\r\nwe will relate it in its proper place.\r\n\r\n2. Upon the death of Josiah, which we have already mentioned, his son,\r\nJehoahaz by name, took the kingdom, being about twenty-three years old.\r\nHe reigned in Jerusalem; and his mother was Hamutal, of the city Libhah.\r\nHe was an impious man, and impure in his course of life; but as the king\r\nof Egypt returned from the battle, he sent for Jehoahaz to come to him,\r\nto the city called Hamath 11 which belongs to Syria; and when he was\r\ncome, he put him in bands, and delivered the kingdom to a brother of\r\nhis, by the father's side, whose name was Eliakim, and changed his name\r\nto Jehoiakim and laid a tribute upon the land of a hundred talents of\r\nsilver, and a talent of gold; and this sum of money Jehoiakim paid by\r\nway of tribute; but Neco carried away Jehoahaz into Egypt, where he died\r\nwhen he had reigned three months and ten days. Now Jehoiakim's mother\r\nwas called Zebudah, of the city Rumah. He was of a wicked disposition,\r\nand ready to do mischief; nor was he either religious towards God, or\r\ngood-natured towards men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How Nebuchadnezzar, When He Had Conquered The King Of Egypt\r\nMade An Expedition Against The Jews, And Slew Jehoiakim, And Made\r\nJehoiachin His Son King.\r\n\r\n1. Now in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim, one whose name was\r\nNebuchadnezzar took the government over the Babylonians, who at the same\r\ntime went up with a great army to the city Carchemish, which was at\r\nEuphrates, upon a resolution he had taken to fight with Neco king of\r\nEgypt, under whom all Syria then was. And when Neco understood the\r\nintention of the king of Babylon, and that this expedition was made\r\nagainst him, he did not despise his attempt, but made haste with a great\r\nband of men to Euphrates to defend himself from Nebuchadnezzar; and when\r\nthey had joined battle, he was beaten, and lost many ten thousands [of\r\nhis soldiers] in the battle. So the king of Babylon passed over\r\nEuphrates, and took all Syria, as far as Pelusium, excepting Judea. But\r\nwhen Nebuchadnezzar had already reigned four years, which was the eighth\r\nof Jehoiakim's government over the Hebrews, the king of Babylon made an\r\nexpedition with mighty forces against the Jews, and required tribute of\r\nJehoiakim, and threatened upon his refusal to make war against him. He\r\nwas affrighted at his threatening, and bought his peace with money, and\r\nbrought the tribute he was ordered to bring for three years.\r\n\r\n2. But on the third year, upon hearing that the king of the Babylonians\r\nmade an expedition against the Egyptians, he did not pay his tribute;\r\nyet was he disappointed of his hope, for the Egyptians durst not fight\r\nat this time. And indeed the prophet Jeremiah foretold every day, how\r\nvainly they relied on their hopes from Egypt, and how the city would be\r\noverthrown by the king of Babylon, and Jehoiakim the king would be\r\nsubdued by him. But what he thus spake proved to be of no advantage to\r\nthem, because there were none that should escape; for both the multitude\r\nand the rulers, when they heard him, had no concern about what they\r\nheard; but being displeased at what was said, as if the prophet were a\r\ndiviner against the king, they accused Jeremiah, and bringing him before\r\nthe court, they required that a sentence and a punishment might be given\r\nagainst him. Now all the rest gave their votes for his condemnation, but\r\nthe elders refused, who prudently sent away the prophet from the court\r\nof [the prison], and persuaded the rest to do Jeremiah no harm; for they\r\nsaid that he was not the only person who foretold what would come to the\r\ncity, but that Micah signified the same before him, as well as many\r\nothers, none of which suffered any thing of the kings that then reigned,\r\nbut were honored as the prophets of God. So they mollified the multitude\r\nwith these words, and delivered Jeremiah from the punishment to which he\r\nwas condemned. Now when this prophet had written all his prophecies, and\r\nthe people were fasting, and assembled at the temple, on the ninth month\r\nof the fifth year of Jehoiakim, he read the book he had composed of his\r\npredictions of what was to befall the city, and the temple, and the\r\nmultitude. And when the rulers heard of it, they took the book from him,\r\nand bid him and Baruch the scribe to go their ways, lest they should be\r\ndiscovered by one or other; but they carried the book, and gave it to\r\nthe king; so he gave order, in the presence of his friends, that his\r\nscribe should take it, and read it. When the king heard what it\r\ncontained, he was angry, and tore it, and cast it into the fire, where\r\nit was consumed. He also commanded that they should seek for Jeremiah,\r\nand Baruch the scribe, and bring them to him, that they might be\r\npunished. However, they escaped his anger.\r\n\r\n3. Now, a little time afterwards, the king of Babylon made an expedition\r\nagainst Jehoiakim, whom he received [into the city], and this out of\r\nfear of the foregoing predictions of this prophet, as supposing he\r\nshould suffer nothing that was terrible, because he neither shut the\r\ngates, nor fought against him; yet when he was come into the city, he\r\ndid not observe the covenants he had made, but he slew such as were in\r\nthe flower of their age, and such as were of the greatest dignity,\r\ntogether with their king Jehoiakim, whom he commanded to be thrown\r\nbefore the walls, without any burial; and made his son Jehoiachin king\r\nof the country, and of the city: he also took the principal persons in\r\ndignity for captives, three thousand in number, and led them away to\r\nBabylon; among which was the prophet Ezekiel, who was then but young.\r\nAnd this was the end of king Jehoiakim, when he had lived thirty-six\r\nyears, and of them reigned eleven. But Jehoiachin succeeded him in the\r\nkingdom, whose mother's name was Nehushta; she was a citizen of\r\nJerusalem. He reigned three months and ten days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. That The King Of Babylon Repented Of Making Jehoiachin King,\r\nAnd Took Him Away To Babylon And Delivered The Kingdom To Zedekiah. This\r\nKing Would Not Believe What Was Predicted By Jeremiah And Ezekiel But\r\nJoined Himself To The Egyptians; Who When They Came Into Judea, Were\r\nVanquished By The King Of Babylon; As Also What Befell Jeremiah.\r\n\r\n1. But a terror seized on the king of Babylon, who had given the kingdom\r\nto Jehoiachin, and that immediately; he was afraid that he should bear\r\nhim a grudge, because of his killing his father, and thereupon should\r\nmake the country revolt from him; wherefore he sent an army, and\r\nbesieged Jehoiachin in Jerusalem; but because he was of a gentle and\r\njust disposition, he did not desire to see the city endangered on his\r\naccount, but he took his mother and kindred, and delivered them to the\r\ncommanders sent by the king of Babylon, and accepted of their oaths,\r\nthat neither should they suffer any harm, nor the city; which agreement\r\nthey did not observe for a single year, for the king of Babylon did not\r\nkeep it, but gave orders to his generals to take all that were in the\r\ncity captives, both the youth and the handicraftsmen, and bring them\r\nbound to him; their number was ten thousand eight hundred and thirty-\r\ntwo; as also Jehoiachin, and his mother and friends. And when these were\r\nbrought to him, he kept them in custody, and appointed Jehoiachin's\r\nuncle, Zedekiah, to be king; and made him take an oath, that he would\r\ncertainly keep the kingdom for him, and make no innovation, nor have any\r\nleague of friendship with the Egyptians.\r\n\r\n2. Now Zedekiah was twenty and one year's old when he took the\r\ngovernment; and had the same mother with his brother Jehoiakim, but was\r\na despiser of justice and of his duty, for truly those of the same age\r\nwith him were wicked about him, and the whole multitude did what unjust\r\nand insolent things they pleased; for which reason the prophet Jeremiah\r\ncame often to him, and protested to him, and insisted, that he must\r\nleave off his impieties and transgressions, and take care of what was\r\nright, and neither give ear to the rulers, [among whom were wicked men,]\r\nnor give credit to their false prophets, who deluded them, as if the\r\nking of Babylon would make no more war against them, and as if the\r\nEgyptians would make war against him, and conquer him, since what they\r\nsaid was not true, and the events would not prove such [as they\r\nexpected]. Now as to Zedekiah himself, while he heard the prophet speak,\r\nhe believed him, and agreed to every thing as true, and supposed it was\r\nfor his advantage; but then his friends perverted him, and dissuaded him\r\nfrom what the prophet advised, and obliged him to do what they pleased.\r\nEzekiel also foretold in Babylon what calamities were coming upon the\r\npeople, which when he heard, he sent accounts of them unto Jerusalem.\r\nBut Zedekiah did not believe their prophecies, for the reason following:\r\nIt happened that the two prophets agreed with one another in what they\r\nsaid as in all other things, that the city should be taken, and Zedekiah\r\nhimself should be taken captive; but Ezekiel disagreed with him, and\r\nsaid that Zedekiah should not see Babylon, while Jeremiah said to him,\r\nthat the king of Babylon should carry him away thither in bonds....\r\n\r\n3. Now when Zedekiah had preserved the league of mutual assistance he\r\nhad made with the Babylonians for eight years, he brake it, and revolted\r\nto the Egyptians, in hopes, by their assistance, of overcoming the\r\nBabylonians. When the king of Babylon knew this, he made war against\r\nhim: he laid his country waste, and took his fortified towns, and came\r\nto the city Jerusalem itself to besiege it. But when the king of Egypt\r\nheard what circumstances Zedekiah his ally was in, he took a great army\r\nwith him, and came into Judea, as if he would raise the siege; upon\r\nwhich the king of Babylon departed from Jerusalem, and met the\r\nEgyptians, and joined battle with them, and beat them; and when he had\r\nput them to flight, he pursued them, and drove them out of all Syria.\r\nNow as soon as the king of Babylon was departed from Jerusalem, the\r\nfalse prophets deceived Zedekiah, and said that the king of Babylon\r\nwould not any more make war against him or his people, nor remove them\r\nout of their own country into Babylon; and that those then in captivity\r\nwould return, with all those vessels of the temple of which the king of\r\nBabylon had despoiled that temple. But Jeremiah came among them, and\r\nprophesied what contradicted those predictions, and what proved to be\r\ntrue, that they did ill, and deluded the king; that the Egyptians would\r\nbe of no advantage to them, but that the king of Babylon would renew the\r\nwar against Jerusalem, and besiege it again, and would destroy the\r\npeople by famine, and carry away those that remained into captivity, and\r\nwould take away what they had as spoils, and would carry off those\r\nriches that were in the temple; nay, that, besides this, he would burn\r\nit, and utterly overthrow the city, and that they should serve him and\r\nhis posterity seventy years; that then the Persians and the Medes should\r\nput an end to their servitude, and overthrow the Babylonians; \"and that\r\nwe shall be dismissed, and return to this land, and rebuild the temple,\r\nand restore Jerusalem.\" When Jeremiah said this, the greater part\r\nbelieved him; but the rulers, and those that were wicked, despised him,\r\nas one disordered in his senses. Now he had resolved to go elsewhere, to\r\nhis own country, which was called Anathoth, and was twenty furlongs\r\ndistant from Jerusalem; 12 and as he was going, one of the rulers met\r\nhim, and seized upon him, and accused him falsely, as though he were\r\ngoing as a deserter to the Babylonians; but Jeremiah said that he\r\naccused him falsely, and added, that he was only going to his own\r\ncountry; but the other would not believe him, but seized upon him, and\r\nled him away to the rulers, and laid an accusation against him, under\r\nwhom he endured all sorts of torments and tortures, and was reserved to\r\nbe punished; and this was the condition he was in for some time, while\r\nhe suffered what I have already described unjustly.\r\n\r\n4. Now in the ninth year of the reign of Zedekiah, on the tenth day of\r\nthe tenth month, the king of Babylon made a second expedition against\r\nJerusalem, and lay before it eighteen months, and besieged it with the\r\nutmost application. There came upon them also two of the greatest\r\ncalamities at the same time that Jerusalem was besieged, a famine and a\r\npestilential distemper, and made great havoc of them. And though the\r\nprophet Jeremiah was in prison, he did not rest, but cried out, and\r\nproclaimed aloud, and exhorted the multitude to open their gates, and\r\nadmit the king of Babylon, for that if they did so, they should be\r\npreserved, and their whole families; but if they did not so, they should\r\nbe destroyed; and he foretold, that if any one staid in the city, he\r\nshould certainly perish by one of these ways,—either be consumed by the\r\nfamine, or slain by the enemy's sword; but that if he would flee to the\r\nenemy, he should escape death. Yet did not these rulers who heard\r\nbelieve him, even when they were in the midst of their sore calamities;\r\nbut they came to the king, and in their anger informed him what Jeremiah\r\nhad said, and accused him, and complained of the prophet as of a madman,\r\nand one that disheartened their minds, and by the denunciation of\r\nmiseries weakened the alacrity of the multitude, who were otherwise\r\nready to expose themselves to dangers for him, and for their country,\r\nwhile he, in a way of threatening, warned them to flee to the enemy, and\r\ntold them that the city should certainly be taken, and be utterly\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n5. But for the king himself, he was not at all irritated against\r\nJeremiah, such was his gentle and righteous disposition; yet, that he\r\nmight not be engaged in a quarrel with those rulers at such a time, by\r\nopposing what they intended, he let them do with the prophet whatsoever\r\nthey would; whereupon, when the king had granted them such a permission,\r\nthey presently came into the prison, and took him, and let him down with\r\na cord into a pit full of mire, that he might be suffocated, and die of\r\nhimself. So he stood up to the neck in the mire which was all about him,\r\nand so continued; but there was one of the king's servants, who was in\r\nesteem with him, an Ethiopian by descent, who told the king what a state\r\nthe prophet was in, and said that his friends and his rulers had done\r\nevil in putting the prophet into the mire, and by that means contriving\r\nagainst him that he should suffer a death more bitter than that by his\r\nbonds only. When the king heard this, he repented of his having\r\ndelivered up the prophet to the rulers, and bid the Ethiopian take\r\nthirty men of the king's guards, and cords with them, and whatsoever\r\nelse they understood to be necessary for the prophet's preservation, and\r\nto draw him up immediately. So the Ethiopian took the men he was ordered\r\nto take, and drew up the prophet out of the mire, and left him at\r\nliberty [in the prison].\r\n\r\n6. But when the king had sent to call him privately, and inquired what\r\nhe could say to him from God, which might be suitable to his present\r\ncircumstances, and desired him to inform him of it, Jeremiah replied,\r\nthat he had somewhat to say; but he said withal, he should not be\r\nbelieved, nor, if he admonished them, should be hearkened to; \"for,\"\r\nsaid he, \"thy friends have determined to destroy me, as though I had\r\nbeen guilty of some wickedness; and where are now those men who deceived\r\nus, and said that the king of Babylon would not come and fight against\r\nus any more? but I am afraid now to speak the truth, lest thou shouldst\r\ncondemn me to die.\" And when the king had assured him upon oath, that he\r\nwould neither himself put him to death, nor deliver him up to the\r\nrulers, he became bold upon that assurance that was given him, and gave\r\nhim this advice: That he should deliver the city up to the Babylonians;\r\nand he said that it was God who prophesied this by him, that [he must do\r\nso] if he would be preserved, and escape out of the danger he was in,\r\nand that then neither should the city fall to the ground, nor should the\r\ntemple be burned; but that [if he disobeyed] he would be the cause of\r\nthese miseries coming upon the citizens, and of the calamity that would\r\nbefall his whole house. When the king heard this, he said that he would\r\nwillingly do what he persuaded him to, and what he declared would be to\r\nhis advantage, but that he was afraid of those of his own country that\r\nhad fallen away to the Babylonians, lest he should be accused by them to\r\nthe king of Babylon, and be punished. But the prophet encouraged him,\r\nand said he had no cause to fear such punishment, for that he should not\r\nhave the experience of any misfortune, if he would deliver all up to the\r\nBabylonians, neither himself, nor his children, nor his wives, and that\r\nthe temple should then continue unhurt. So when Jeremiah had said this,\r\nthe king let him go, and charged him to betray what they had resolved on\r\nto none of the citizens, nor to tell any of these matters to any of the\r\nrulers, if they should have learned that he had been sent for, and\r\nshould inquire of him what it was that he was sent for, and what he had\r\nsaid to him; but to pretend to them that he besought him that he might\r\nnot be kept in bonds and in prison. And indeed he said so to them; for\r\nthey came to the prophet, and asked him what advice it was that he came\r\nto give the king relating to them. And thus I have finished what\r\nconcerns this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. How The King Of Babylon Took Jerusalem And Burnt The Temple\r\nAnd Removed The People Of Jerusalem And Zedekiah To Babylon. As Also,\r\nWho They Were That Had Succeeded In The High Priesthood Under The Kings.\r\n\r\n1. Now the king of Babylon was very intent and earnest upon the siege of\r\nJerusalem; and he erected towers upon great banks of earth, and from\r\nthem repelled those that stood upon the walls; he also made a great\r\nnumber of such banks round about the whole city, whose height was equal\r\nto those walls. However, those that were within bore the siege with\r\ncourage and alacrity, for they were not discouraged, either by the\r\nfamine, or by the pestilential distemper, but were of cheerful minds in\r\nthe prosecution of the war, although those miseries within oppressed\r\nthem also, and they did not suffer themselves to be terrified, either by\r\nthe contrivances of the enemy, or by their engines of war, but contrived\r\nstill different engines to oppose all the other withal, till indeed\r\nthere seemed to be an entire struggle between the Babylonians and the\r\npeople of Jerusalem, which had the greater sagacity and skill; the\r\nformer party supposing they should be thereby too hard for the other,\r\nfor the destruction of the city; the latter placing their hopes of\r\ndeliverance in nothing else but in persevering in such inventions in\r\nopposition to the other, as might demonstrate the enemy's engines were\r\nuseless to them. And this siege they endured for eighteen months, until\r\nthey were destroyed by the famine, and by the darts which the enemy\r\nthrew at them from the towers.\r\n\r\n2. Now the city was taken on the ninth day of the fourth month, in the\r\neleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah. They were indeed only generals\r\nof the king of Babylon, to whom Nebuchadnezzar committed the care of the\r\nsiege, for he abode himself in the city of Riblah. The names of these\r\ngenerals who ravaged and subdued Jerusalem, if any one desire to know\r\nthem, were these: Nergal Sharezer, Samgar Nebo, Rabsaris, Sorsechim, and\r\nRabmag. And when the city was taken about midnight, and the enemy's\r\ngenerals were entered into the temple, and when Zedekiah was sensible of\r\nit, he took his wives, and his children, and his captains, and his\r\nfriends, and with them fled out of the city, through the fortified\r\nditch, and through the desert; and when certain of the deserters had\r\ninformed the Babylonians of this, at break of day, they made haste to\r\npursue after Zedekiah, and overtook him not far from Jericho, and\r\nencompassed him about. But for those friends and captains of Zedekiah\r\nwho had fled out of the city with him, when they saw their enemies near\r\nthem, they left him, and dispersed themselves, some one way, and some\r\nanother, and every one resolved to save himself; so the enemy took\r\nZedekiah alive, when he was deserted by all but a few, with his children\r\nand his wives, and brought him to the king. When he was come,\r\nNebuchadnezzar began to call him a wicked wretch, and a covenant-\r\nbreaker, and one that had forgotten his former words, when he promised\r\nto keep the country for him. He also reproached him for his ingratitude,\r\nthat when he had received the kingdom from him, who had taken it from\r\nJehoiachin, and given it to him, he had made use of the power he gave\r\nhim against him that gave it; \"but,\" said he, \"God is great, who hated\r\nthat conduct of thine, and hath brought thee under us.\" And when he had\r\nused these words to Zedekiah, he commanded his sons and his friends to\r\nbe slain, while Zedekiah and the rest of the captains looked on; after\r\nwhich he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him, and carried him to\r\nBabylon. And these things happened to him, 13 as Jeremiah and Ezekiel\r\nhad foretold to him, that he should be caught, and brought before the\r\nking of Babylon, and should speak to him face to face, and should see\r\nhis eyes with his own eyes; and thus far did Jeremiah prophesy. But he\r\nwas also made blind, and brought to Babylon, but did not see it,\r\naccording to the prediction of Ezekiel.\r\n\r\n3. We have said thus much, because it was sufficient to show the nature\r\nof God to such as are ignorant of it, that it is various, and acts many\r\ndifferent ways, and that all events happen after a regular manner, in\r\ntheir proper season, and that it foretells what must come to pass. It is\r\nalso sufficient to show the ignorance and incredulity of men, whereby\r\nthey are not permitted to foresee any thing that is future, and are,\r\nwithout any guard, exposed to calamities, so that it is impossible for\r\nthem to avoid the experience of those calamities.\r\n\r\n4. And after this manner have the kings of David's race ended their\r\nlives, being in number twenty-one, until the last king, who all together\r\nreigned five hundred and fourteen years, and six months, and ten days;\r\nof whom Saul, who was their first king, retained the government twenty\r\nyears, though he was not of the same tribe with the rest.\r\n\r\n5. And now it was that the king of Babylon sent Nebuzaradan, the general\r\nof his army, to Jerusalem, to pillage the temple, who had it also in\r\ncommand to burn it and the royal palace, and to lay the city even with\r\nthe ground, and to transplant the people into Babylon. Accordingly, he\r\ncame to Jerusalem in the eleventh year of king Zedekiah, and pillaged\r\nthe temple, and carried out the vessels of God, both gold and silver,\r\nand particularly that large laver which Solomon dedicated, as also the\r\npillars of brass, and their chapiters, with the golden tables and the\r\ncandlesticks; and when he had carried these off, he set fire to the\r\ntemple in the fifth month, the first day of the month, in the eleventh\r\nyear of the reign of Zedekiah, and in the eighteenth year of\r\nNebuchadnezzar: he also burnt the palace, and overthrew the city. Now\r\nthe temple was burnt four hundred and seventy years, six months, and ten\r\ndays after it was built. It was then one thousand and sixty-two years,\r\nsix months, and ten days from the departure out of Egypt; and from the\r\ndeluge to the destruction of the temple, the whole interval was one\r\nthousand nine hundred and fifty-seven years, six months, and ten days;\r\nbut from the generation of Adam, until this befell the temple, there\r\nwere three thousand five hundred and thirteen years, six months, and ten\r\ndays; so great was the number of years hereto belonging. And what\r\nactions were done during these years we have particularly related. But\r\nthe general of the Babylonian king now overthrew the city to the very\r\nfoundations, and removed all the people, and took for prisoners the high\r\npriest Seraiah, and Zephaniah the priest that was next to him, and the\r\nrulers that guarded the temple, who were three in number, and the eunuch\r\nwho was over the armed men, and seven friends of Zedekiah, and his\r\nscribe, and sixty other rulers; all which, together with the vessels\r\nwhich they had pillaged, he carried to the king of Babylon to Riblah, a\r\ncity of Syria. So the king commanded the heads of the high priest and of\r\nthe rulers to be cut off there; but he himself led all the captives and\r\nZedekiah to Babylon. He also led Josedek the high priest away bound. He\r\nwas the son of Seraiah the high priest, whom the king of Babylon had\r\nslain in Riblah, a city of Syria, as we just now related.\r\n\r\n6. And now, because we have enumerated the succession of the kings, and\r\nwho they were, and how long they reigned, I think it necessary to set\r\ndown the names of the high priests, and who they were that succeeded one\r\nanother in the high priesthood under the Kings. The first high priest\r\nthen at the temple which Solomon built was Zadok; after him his son\r\nAchimas received that dignity; after Achimas was Azarias; his son was\r\nJoram, and Joram's son was Isus; after him was Axioramus; his son was\r\nPhidens, and Phideas's son was Sudeas, and Sudeas's son was Juelus, and\r\nJuelus's son was Jotham, and Jotham's son was Urias, and Urias's son was\r\nNerias, and Nerias's son was Odeas, and his son was Sallumus, and\r\nSallumus's son was Elcias, and his son [was Azarias, and his son] was\r\nSareas, 14 and his son was Josedec, who was carried captive to Babylon.\r\nAll these received the high priesthood by succession, the sons from\r\ntheir father.\r\n\r\n7. When the king was come to Babylon, he kept Zedekiah in prison until\r\nhe died, and buried him magnificently, and dedicated the vessels he had\r\npillaged out of the temple of Jerusalem to his own gods, and planted the\r\npeople in the country of Babylon, but freed the high priest from his\r\nbonds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. How Nebuzaradan Set Gedaliah Over The Jews That Were Left In\r\nJudea Which Gedaliah Was A Little Afterward Slain By Ishmael; And How\r\nJohanan After Ishmael Was Driven Away Went Down Into Egypt With The\r\nPeople Which People Nebuchadnezzar When He Made An Expedition Against\r\nThe Egyptians Took Captive And Brought Them Away To Babylon.\r\n\r\n1. Now the general of the army, Nebuzaradan, when he had carried the\r\npeople of the Jews into captivity, left the poor, and those that had\r\ndeserted, in the country, and made one, whose name was Gedaliah, the son\r\nof Ahikam, a person of a noble family, their governor; which Gedaliah\r\nwas of a gentle and righteous disposition. He also commanded them that\r\nthey should cultivate the ground, and pay an appointed tribute to the\r\nking. He also took Jeremiah the prophet out of prison, and would have\r\npersuaded him to go along with him to Babylon, for that he had been\r\nenjoined by the king to supply him with whatsoever he wanted; and if he\r\ndid not like to do so, he desired him to inform him where he resolved to\r\ndwell, that he might signify the same to the king. But the prophet had\r\nno mind to follow him, nor to dwell any where else, but would gladly\r\nlive in the ruins of his country, and in the miserable remains of it.\r\nWhen the general understood what his purpose was, he enjoined Gedaliah,\r\nwhom he left behind, to take all possible care of him, and to supply him\r\nwith whatsoever he wanted. So when he had given him rich presents, he\r\ndismissed him. Accordingly, Jeremiah abode in a city of that country,\r\nwhich was called Mispah; and desired of Nebuzaradan that he would set at\r\nliberty his disciple Baruch, the son of Neriah, one of a very eminent\r\nfamily, and exceeding skillful in the language of his country.\r\n\r\n2. When Nebuzaradan had done thus, he made haste to Babylon. But as to\r\nthose that fled away during the siege of Jerusalem, and had been\r\nscattered over the country, when they heard that the Babylonians were\r\ngone away, and had left a remnant in the land of Jerusalem, and those\r\nsuch as were to cultivate the same, they came together from all parts to\r\nGedaliah to Mispah. Now the rulers that were over them were Johanan, the\r\nson of Kareah, and Jezaniah, and Seraiah, and others beside them. Now\r\nthere was of the royal family one Ishmael, a wicked man, and very\r\ncrafty, who, during the siege of Jerusalem, fled to Baalis, the king of\r\nthe Ammonites, and abode with him during that time; and Gedaliah\r\npersuaded them, now they were there, to stay with him, and to have no\r\nfear of the Babylonians, for that if they would cultivate the country,\r\nthey should suffer no harm. This he assured them of by oath; and said\r\nthat they should have him for their patron, and that if any disturbance\r\nshould arise, they should find him ready to defend them. He also advised\r\nthem to dwell in any city, as every one of them pleased; and that they\r\nwould send men along with his own servants, and rebuild their houses\r\nupon the old foundations, and dwell there; and he admonished them\r\nbeforehand, that they should make preparation, while the season lasted,\r\nof corn, and wine, and oil, that they might have whereon to feed during\r\nthe winter. When he had thus discoursed to them, he dismissed them, that\r\nevery one might dwell in what place of the country he pleased.\r\n\r\n3. Now when this report was spread abroad as far as the nations that\r\nbordered on Judea, that Gedaliah kindly entertained those that came to\r\nhim, after they had fled away, upon this [only] condition, that they\r\nshould pay tribute to the king of Babylon, they also came readily to\r\nGedaliah, and inhabited the country. And when Johanan, and the rulers\r\nthat were with him, observed the country, and the humanity of Gedaliah,\r\nthey were exceedingly in love with him, and told him that Baalis, the\r\nking of the Ammonites, had sent Ishmael to kill him by treachery, and\r\nsecretly, that he might have the dominion over the Israelites, as being\r\nof the royal family; and they said that he might deliver himself from\r\nthis treacherous design, if he would give them leave to slay Ishmael,\r\nand nobody should know it, for they told him they were afraid that, when\r\nhe was killed by the other, the entire ruin of the remaining strength of\r\nthe Israelites would ensue. But he professed that he did not believe\r\nwhat they said, when they told him of such a treacherous design, in a\r\nman that had been well treated by him; because it was not probable that\r\none who, under such a want of all things, had failed of nothing that was\r\nnecessary for him, should be found so wicked and ungrateful towards his\r\nbenefactor, that when it would be an instance of wickedness in him not\r\nto save him, had he been treacherously assaulted by others, to endeavor,\r\nand that earnestly, to kill him with his own hands: that, however, if he\r\nought to suppose this information to be true, it was better for himself\r\nto be slain by the other, than to destroy a man who fled to him for\r\nrefuge, and intrusted his own safety to him, and committed himself to\r\nhis disposal.\r\n\r\n4. So Johanan, and the rulers that were with him, not being able to\r\npersuade Gedaliah, went away. But after the interval of thirty days was\r\nover, Ishmael came again to Gedaliah, to the city Mispah, and ten men\r\nwith him; and when he had feasted Ishmael, and those that were with him,\r\nin a splendid manner at his table, and had given them presents, he\r\nbecame disordered in drink, while he endeavored to be very merry with\r\nthem; and when Ishmael saw him in that case, and that he was drowned in\r\nhis cups to the degree of insensibility, and fallen asleep, he rose up\r\non a sudden, with his ten friends, and slew Gedaliah, and those that\r\nwere with him at the feast; and when he had slain them, he went out by\r\nnight, and slew all the Jews that were in the city, and those soldiers\r\nalso which were left therein by the Babylonians. But the next day\r\nfourscore men came out of the country with presents to Gedaliah, none of\r\nthem knowing what had befallen him; when Ishmael saw them, he invited\r\nthem in to Gedaliah, and when they were come in, he shut up the court,\r\nand slew them, and cast their dead bodies down into a certain deep pit,\r\nthat they might not be seen; but of these fourscore men Ishmael spared\r\nthose that entreated him not to kill them, till they had delivered up to\r\nhim what riches they had concealed in the fields, consisting of their\r\nfurniture, and garments, and corn: but he took captive the people that\r\nwere in Mispah, with their wives and children; among whom were the\r\ndaughters of king Zedekiah, whom Nebuzaradan, the general of the army of\r\nBabylon, had left with Gedaliah. And when he had done this, he came to\r\nthe king of the Ammonites.\r\n\r\n5. But when Johanan and the rulers with him heard of what was done at\r\nMispah by Ishmael, and of the death of Gedaliah, they had indignation at\r\nit, and every one of them took his own armed men, and came suddenly to\r\nfight with Ishmael, and overtook him at the fountain in Hebron. And when\r\nthose that were carried away captives by Ishmael saw Johanan and the\r\nrulers, they were very glad, and looked upon them as coming to their\r\nassistance; so they left him that had carried them captives, and came\r\nover to Johanan: then Ishmael, with eight men, fled to the king of the\r\nAmmonites; but Johanan took those whom he had rescued out of the hands\r\nof Ishmael, and the eunuchs, and their wives and children, and came to a\r\ncertain place called Mandra, and there they abode that day, for they had\r\ndetermined to remove from thence and go into Egypt, out of fear, lest\r\nthe Babylonians should slay them, in case they continued in the country,\r\nand that out of anger at the slaughter of Gedaliah, who had been by them\r\nset over it for governor.\r\n\r\n6. Now while they were under this deliberation, Johanan, the son of\r\nKareah, and the rulers that were with him, came to Jeremiah the prophet,\r\nand desired that he would pray to God, that because they were at an\r\nutter loss about what they ought to do, he would discover it to them,\r\nand they sware that they would do whatsoever Jeremiah should say to\r\nthem. And when the prophet said he would be their intercessor with God,\r\nit came to pass, that after ten days God appeared to him, and said that\r\nhe should inform Johanan, and the other rulers, and all the people, that\r\nhe would be with them while they continued in that country, and take\r\ncare of them, and keep them from being hurt by the Babylonians, of whom\r\nthey were afraid; but that he would desert them if they went into Egypt,\r\nand, out of this wrath against them, would inflict the same punishments\r\nupon them which they knew their brethren had already endured. So when\r\nthe prophet had informed Johanan and the people that God had foretold\r\nthese things, he was not believed, when he said that God commanded them\r\nto continue in the country; but they imagined that he said so to gratify\r\nBaruch, his own disciple, and belied God, and that he persuaded them to\r\nstay there, that they might be destroyed by the Babylonians.\r\nAccordingly, both the people and Johanan disobeyed the counsel of God,\r\nwhich he gave them by the prophet, and removed into Egypt, and carried\r\nJeremiah and Barnch along with him.\r\n\r\n7. And when they were there, God signified to the prophet that the king\r\nof Babylon was about making an expedition against the Egyptians, and\r\ncommanded him to foretell to the people that Egypt should be taken, and\r\nthe king of Babylon should slay some of them and, should take others\r\ncaptive, and bring them to Babylon; which things came to pass\r\naccordingly; for on the fifth year after the destruction of Jerusalem,\r\nwhich was the twenty-third of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, he made an\r\nexpedition against Celesyria; and when he had possessed himself of it,\r\nhe made war against the Ammonites and Moabites; and when he had brought\r\nall these nations under subjection, he fell upon Egypt, in order to\r\noverthrow it; and he slew the king that then reigned 15 and set up\r\nanother; and he took those Jews that were there captives, and led them\r\naway to Babylon. And such was the end of the nation of the Hebrews, as\r\nit hath been delivered down to us, it having twice gone beyond\r\nEuphrates; for the people of the ten tribes were carried out of Samaria\r\nby the Assyrians, in the days of king Hoshea; after which the people of\r\nthe two tribes that remained after Jerusalem was taken [were carried\r\naway] by Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon and Chaldea. Now as to\r\nShalmanezer, he removed the Israelites out of their country, and placed\r\ntherein the nation of the Cutheans, who had formerly belonged to the\r\ninner parts of Persia and Media, but were then called Samaritans, by\r\ntaking the name of the country to which they were removed; but the king\r\nof Babylon, who brought out the two tribes, 16 placed no other nation in\r\ntheir country, by which means all Judea and Jerusalem, and the temple,\r\ncontinued to be a desert for seventy years; but the entire interval of\r\ntime which passed from the captivity of the Israelites, to the carrying\r\naway of the two tribes, proved to be a hundred and thirty years, six\r\nmonths, and ten days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. Concerning Daniel And What Befell Him At Babylon.\r\n\r\n1. But now Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, took some of the most noble\r\nof the Jews that were children, and the kinsmen of Zedekiah their king,\r\nsuch as were remarkable for the beauty of their bodies, and the\r\ncomeliness of their countenances, and delivered them into the hands of\r\ntutors, and to the improvement to be made by them. He also made some of\r\nthem to be eunuchs; which course he took also with those of other\r\nnations whom he had taken in the flower of their age, and afforded them\r\ntheir diet from his own table, and had them instructed in the institutes\r\nof the country, and taught the learning of the Chaldeans; and they had\r\nnow exercised themselves sufficiently in that wisdom which he had\r\nordered they should apply themselves to. Now among these there were four\r\nof the family of Zedekiah, of most excellent dispositions, one of whom\r\nwas called Daniel, another was called Ananias, another Misael, and the\r\nfourth Azarias; and the king of Babylon changed their names, and\r\ncommanded that they should make use of other names. Daniel he called\r\nBaltasar; Ananias, Shadrach; Misael, Meshach; and Azarias, Abednego.\r\nThese the king had in esteem, and continued to love, because of the very\r\nexcellent temper they were of, and because of their application to\r\nlearning, and the profess they had made in wisdom.\r\n\r\n2. Now Daniel and his kinsmen had resolved to use a severe diet, and to\r\nabstain from those kinds of food which came from the king's table, and\r\nentirely to forbear to eat of all living creatures. So he came to\r\nAshpenaz, who was that eunuch to whom the care of them was committed, 17\r\nand desired him to take and spend what was brought for them from the\r\nking, but to give them pulse and dates for their food, and any thing\r\nelse, besides the flesh of living creatures, that he pleased, for that\r\ntheir inclinations were to that sort of food, and that they despised the\r\nother. He replied, that he was ready to serve them in what they desired,\r\nbut he suspected that they would be discovered by the king, from their\r\nmeagre bodies, and the alteration of their countenances, because it\r\ncould not be avoided but their bodies and colors must be changed with\r\ntheir diet, especially while they would be clearly discovered by the\r\nfiner appearance of the other children, who would fare better, and thus\r\nthey should bring him into danger, and occasion him to be punished; yet\r\ndid they persuade Arioch, who was thus fearful, to give them what food\r\nthey desired for ten days, by way of trial; and in case the habit of\r\ntheir bodies were not altered, to go on in the same way, as expecting\r\nthat they should not be hurt thereby afterwards; but if he saw them look\r\nmeagre, and worse than the rest, he should reduce them to their former\r\ndiet. Now when it appeared that they were so far from becoming worse by\r\nthe use of this food, that they grew plumper and fuller in body than the\r\nrest, insomuch that he thought those who fed on what came from the\r\nking's table seemed less plump and full, while those that were with\r\nDaniel looked as if they had lived in plenty, and in all sorts of\r\nluxury. Arioch, from that time, securely took himself what the king sent\r\nevery day from his supper, according to custom, to the children, but\r\ngave them the forementioned diet, while they had their souls in some\r\nmeasure more pure, and less burdened, and so fitter for learning, and\r\nhad their bodies in better tune for hard labor; for they neither had the\r\nformer oppressed and heavy with variety of meats, nor were the other\r\neffeminate on the same account; so they readily understood all the\r\nlearning that was among the Hebrews, and among the Chaldeans, as\r\nespecially did Daniel, who being already sufficiently skillful in\r\nwisdom, was very busy about the interpretation of dreams; and God\r\nmanifested himself to him.\r\n\r\n3. Now two years after the destruction of Egypt, king Nebuchadnezzar saw\r\na wonderful dream, the accomplishment of which God showed him in his\r\nsleep; but when he arose out of his bed, he forgot the accomplishment.\r\nSo he sent for the Chaldeans and magicians, and the prophets, and told\r\nthem that he had seen a dream, and informed them that he had forgotten\r\nthe accomplishment of what he had seen, and he enjoined them to tell him\r\nboth what the dream was, and what was its signification; and they said\r\nthat this was a thing impossible to be discovered by men; but they\r\npromised him, that if he would explain to them what dream he had seen,\r\nthey would tell him its signification. Hereupon he threatened to put\r\nthem to death, unless they told him his dream; and he gave command to\r\nhave them all put to death, since they confessed they could not do what\r\nthey were commanded to do. Now when Daniel heard that the king had given\r\na command, that all the wise men should be put to death, and that among\r\nthem himself and his three kinsmen were in danger, he went to Arioch,\r\nwho was captain of the king's guards, and desired to know of him what\r\nwas the reason why the king had given command that all the wise men, and\r\nChaldeans, and magicians should be slain. So when he had learned that\r\nthe king had had a dream, and had forgotten it, and that when they were\r\nenjoined to inform the king of it, they had said they could not do it,\r\nand had thereby provoked him to anger, he desired of Arioch that he\r\nwould go in to the king, and desire respite for the magicians for one\r\nnight, and to put off their slaughter so long, for that he hoped within\r\nthat time to obtain, by prayer to God, the knowledge of the dream.\r\nAccordingly, Arioch informed the king of what Daniel desired. So the\r\nking bid them delay the slaughter of the magicians till he knew what\r\nDaniel's promise would come to; but the young man retired to his own\r\nhouse, with his kinsmen, and besought God that whole night to discover\r\nthe dream, and thereby deliver the magicians and Chaldeans, with whom\r\nthey were themselves to perish, from the king's anger, by enabling him\r\nto declare his vision, and to make manifest what the king had seen the\r\nnight before in his sleep, but had forgotten it. Accordingly, God, out\r\nof pity to those that were in danger, and out of regard to the wisdom of\r\nDaniel, made known to him the dream and its interpretation, that so the\r\nking might understand by him its signification also. When Daniel had\r\nobtained this knowledge from God, he arose very joyful, and told it his\r\nbrethren, and made them glad, and to hope well that they should now\r\npreserve their lives, of which they despaired before, and had their\r\nminds full of nothing but the thoughts of dying. So when he had with\r\nthem returned thanks to God, who had commiserated their youth, when it\r\nwas day he came to Arioch, and desired him to bring him to the king,\r\nbecause he would discover to him that dream which he had seen the night\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n4. When Daniel was come in to the king, he excused himself first, that\r\nhe did not pretend to be wiser than the other Chaldeans and magicians,\r\nwhen, upon their entire inability to discover his dream, he was\r\nundertaking to inform him of it; for this was not by his own skill, or\r\non account of his having better cultivated his understanding than the\r\nrest; but he said, \"God hath had pity upon us, when we were in danger of\r\ndeath, and when I prayed for the life of myself, and of those of my own\r\nnation, hath made manifest to me both the dream, and the interpretation\r\nthereof; for I was not less concerned for thy glory than for the sorrow\r\nthat we were by thee condemned to die, while thou didst so unjustly\r\ncommand men, both good and excellent in themselves, to be put to death,\r\nwhen thou enjoinedst them to do what was entirely above the reach of\r\nhuman wisdom, and requiredst of them what was only the work of God.\r\nWherefore, as thou in thy sleep wast solicitous concerning those that\r\nshould succeed thee in the government of the whole world, God was\r\ndesirous to show thee all those that should reign after thee, and to\r\nthat end exhibited to thee the following dream: Thou seemedst to see a\r\ngreat image standing before thee, the head of which proved to be of\r\ngold, the shoulders and arms of silver, and the belly and the thighs of\r\nbrass, but the legs and the feet of iron; after which thou sawest a\r\nstone broken off from a mountain, which fell upon the image, and threw\r\nit down, and brake it to pieces, and did not permit any part of it to\r\nremain whole; but the gold, the silver, the brass, and the iron, became\r\nsmaller than meal, which, upon the blast of a violent wind, was by force\r\ncarried away, and scattered abroad, but the stone did increase to such a\r\ndegree, that the whole earth beneath it seemed to be filled therewith.\r\nThis is the dream which thou sawest, and its interpretation is as\r\nfollows: The head of gold denotes thee, and the kings of Babylon that\r\nhave been before thee; but the two hands and arms signify this, that\r\nyour government shall be dissolved by two kings; but another king that\r\nshall come from the west, armed with brass, shall destroy that\r\ngovernment; and another government, that shall be like unto iron, shall\r\nput an end to the power of the former, and shall have dominion over all\r\nthe earth, on account of the nature of iron, which is stronger than that\r\nof gold, of silver, and of brass.\" Daniel did also declare the meaning\r\nof the stone to the king 18 but I do not think proper to relate it,\r\nsince I have only undertaken to describe things past or things present,\r\nbut not things that are future; yet if any one be so very desirous of\r\nknowing truth, as not to wave such points of curiosity, and cannot curb\r\nhis inclination for understanding the uncertainties of futurity, and\r\nwhether they will happen or not, let him be diligent in reading the book\r\nof Daniel, which he will find among the sacred writings.\r\n\r\n5. When Nebuchadnezzar heard this, and recollected his dream, he was\r\nastonished at the nature of Daniel, and fell upon his knee; and saluted\r\nDaniel in the manner that men worship God, and gave command that he\r\nshould be sacrificed to as a god. And this was not all, for he also\r\nimposed the name, of his own god upon him, [Baltasar,] and made him and\r\nhis kinsmen rulers of his whole kingdom; which kinsmen of his happened\r\nto fall into great danger by the envy and malice [of their enemies]; for\r\nthey offended the king upon the occasion following: he made an image of\r\ngold, whose height was sixty cubits, and its breadth six cubits, and set\r\nit in the great plain of Babylon; and when he was going to dedicate the\r\nimage, he invited the principal men out of all the earth that was under\r\nhis dominions, and commanded them, in the first place, that when they\r\nshould hear the sound of the trumpet, they should then fall down and\r\nworship the image; and he threatened, that those who did not so, should\r\nbe cast into a fiery furnace. When therefore all the rest, upon the\r\nhearing of the sound of the trumpet, worshipped the image, they relate\r\nthat Daniel's kinsmen did not do it, because they would not transgress\r\nthe laws of their country. So these men were convicted, and cast\r\nimmediately into the fire, but were saved by Divine Providence, and\r\nafter a surprising manner escaped death, for the fire did not touch\r\nthem; and I suppose that it touched them not, as if it reasoned with\r\nitself, that they were cast into it without any fault of theirs, and\r\nthat therefore it was too weak to burn the young men when they were in\r\nit. This was done by the power of God, who made their bodies so far\r\nsuperior to the fire, that it could not consume them. This it was which\r\nrecommended them to the king as righteous men, and men beloved of God,\r\non which account they continued in great esteem with him.\r\n\r\n6. A little after this the king saw in his sleep again another vision;\r\nhow he should fall from his dominion, and feed among the wild beasts,\r\nand that when he halt lived in this manner in the desert for seven\r\nyears, 19 he should recover his dominion again. When he had seen this\r\ndream, he called the magicians together again, and inquired of them\r\nabout it, and desired them to tell him what it signified; but when none\r\nof them could find out the meaning of the dream, nor discover it to the\r\nking, Daniel was the only person that explained it; and as he foretold,\r\nso it came to pass; for after he had continued in the wilderness the\r\nforementioned interval of time, while no one durst attempt to seize his\r\nkingdom during those seven years, he prayed to God that he might recover\r\nhis kingdom, and he returned to it. But let no one blame me for writing\r\ndown every thing of this nature, as I find it in our ancient books; for\r\nas to that matter, I have plainly assured those that think me defective\r\nin any such point, or complain of my management, and have told them in\r\nthe beginning of this history, that I intended to do no more than\r\ntranslate the Hebrew books into the Greek language, and promised them to\r\nexplain those facts, without adding any thing to them of my own, or\r\ntaking any thing away from there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. Concerning Nebuchadnezzar And His Successors And How Their\r\nGovernment Was Dissolved By The Persians; And What Things Befell Daniel\r\nIn Media; And What Prophecies He Delivered There.\r\n\r\n1. Now when king Nebuchadnezzar had reigned forty-three years, 20 he\r\nended his life. He was an active man, and more fortunate than the kings\r\nthat were before him. Now Berosus makes mention of his actions in the\r\nthird book of his Chaldaic History, where he says thus: \"When his father\r\nNebuchodonosor [Nabopollassar] heard that the governor whom he had set\r\nover Egypt, and the places about Coelesyria and Phoenicia, had revolted\r\nfrom him, while he was not himself able any longer to undergo the\r\nhardships [of war], he committed to his son Nebuchadnezzar, who was\r\nstill but a youth, some parts of his army, and sent them against him. So\r\nwhen Nebuchadnezzar had given battle, and fought with the rebel, he beat\r\nhim, and reduced the country from under his subjection, and made it a\r\nbranch of his own kingdom; but about that time it happened that his\r\nfather Nebuchodonosor [Nabopollassar] fell ill, and ended his life in\r\nthe city Babylon, when he had reigned twenty-one years; 21 and when he\r\nwas made sensible, as he was in a little time, that his father\r\nNebuchodonosor [Nabopollassar] was dead, and having settled the affairs\r\nof Egypt, and the other countries, as also those that concerned the\r\ncaptive Jews, and Phoenicians, and Syrians, and those of the Egyptian\r\nnations; and having committed the conveyance of them to Babylon to\r\ncertain of his friends, together with the gross of his army, and the\r\nrest of their ammunition and provisions, he went himself hastily,\r\naccompanied with a few others, over the desert, and came to Babylon. So\r\nhe took upon him the management of public affairs, and of the kingdom\r\nwhich had been kept for him by one that was the principal of the\r\nChaldeans, and he received the entire dominions of his father, and\r\nappointed, that when the captives came, they should be placed as\r\ncolonies, in the most proper places of Babylonia; but then he adorned\r\nthe temple of Belus, and the rest of the temples, in a magnificent\r\nmanner, with the spoils he had taken in the war. He also added another\r\ncity to that which was there of old, and rebuilt it, that such as would\r\nbesiege it hereafter might no more turn the course of the river, and\r\nthereby attack the city itself. He therefore built three walls round\r\nabout the inner city, and three others about that which was the outer,\r\nand this he did with burnt brick. And after he had, after a becoming\r\nmanner, walled the city, and adorned its gates gloriously, he built\r\nanother palace before his father's palace, but so that they joined to\r\nit; to describe whose vast height and immense riches it would perhaps be\r\ntoo much for me to attempt; yet as large and lofty as they were, they\r\nwere completed in fifteen days. 22 He also erected elevated places for\r\nwalking, of stone, and made it resemble mountains, and built it so that\r\nit might be planted with all sorts of trees. He also erected what was\r\ncalled a pensile paradise, because his wife was desirous to have things\r\nlike her own country, she having been bred up in the palaces of Media.\"\r\nMegasthenes also, in his fourth book of his Accounts of India, makes\r\nmention of these things, and thereby endeavors to show that this king\r\n[Nebuchadnezzar] exceeded Hercules in fortitude, and in the greatness of\r\nhis actions; for he saith that he conquered a great part of Libya and\r\nIberia. Diocles also, in the second book of his Accounts of Persia,\r\nmentions this king; as does Philostrates in his Accounts both of India\r\nand of Phoenicia, say, that this king besieged Tyre thirteen years,\r\nwhile at the same time Ethbaal reigned at Tyre. These are all the\r\nhistories that I have met with concerning this king.\r\n\r\n2. But now, after the death of Nebuchadnezzar, Evil-Merodach his son\r\nsucceeded in the kingdom, who immediately set Jeconiah at liberty, and\r\nesteemed him among his most intimate friends. He also gave him many\r\npresents, and made him honorable above the rest of the kings that were\r\nin Babylon; for his father had not kept his faith with Jeconiah, when he\r\nvoluntarily delivered up himself to him, with his wives and children,\r\nand his whole kindred, for the sake of his country, that it might not be\r\ntaken by siege, and utterly destroyed, as we said before. When Evil-\r\nMerodach was dead, after a reign of eighteen years, Niglissar his son\r\ntook the government, and retained it forty years, and then ended his\r\nlife; and after him the succession in the kingdom came to his son\r\nLabosordacus, who continued in it in all but nine months; and when he\r\nwas dead, it came to Baltasar, 23 who by the Babylonians was called\r\nNaboandelus; against him did Cyrus, the king of Persia, and Darius, the\r\nking of Media, make war; and when he was besieged in Babylon, there\r\nhappened a wonderful and prodigious vision. He was sat down at supper in\r\na large room, and there were a great many vessels of silver, such as\r\nwere made for royal entertainments, and he had with him his concubines\r\nand his friends; whereupon he came to a resolution, and commanded that\r\nthose vessels of God which Nebuchadnezzar had plundered out of\r\nJerusalem, and had not made use of, but had put them into his own\r\ntemple, should be brought out of that temple. He also grew so haughty as\r\nto proceed to use them in the midst of his cups, drinking out of them,\r\nand blaspheming against God. In the mean time, he saw a hand proceed out\r\nof the wall, and writing upon the wall certain syllables; at which\r\nsight, being disturbed, he called the magicians and Chaldeans together,\r\nand all that sort of men that are among these barbarians, and were able\r\nto interpret signs and dreams, that they might explain the writing to\r\nhim. But when the magicians said they could discover nothing, nor did\r\nunderstand it, the king was in great disorder of mind, and under great\r\ntrouble at this surprising accident; so he caused it to be proclaimed\r\nthrough all the country, and promised, that to him who could explain the\r\nwriting, and give the signification couched therein, he would give him a\r\ngolden chain for his neck, and leave to wear a purple garment, as did\r\nthe kings of Chaldea, and would bestow on him the third part of his own\r\ndominions. When this proclamation was made, the magicians ran together\r\nmore earnestly, and were very ambitious to find out the importance of\r\nthe writing, but still hesitated about it as much as before. Now when\r\nthe king's grandmother saw him cast down at this accident, 24 she began\r\nto encourage him, and to say, that there was a certain captive who came\r\nfrom Judea, a Jew by birth, but brought away thence by Nebuchadnezzar\r\nwhen he had destroyed Jerusalem, whose name was Daniel, a wise man, and\r\none of great sagacity in finding out what was impossible for others to\r\ndiscover, and what was known to God alone, who brought to light and\r\nanswered such questions to Nebuchadnezzar as no one else was able to\r\nanswer when they were consulted. She therefore desired that he would\r\nsend for him, and inquire of him concerning the writing, and to condemn\r\nthe unskilfulness of those that could not find their meaning, and this,\r\nalthough what God signified thereby should be of a melancholy nature.\r\n\r\n3. When Baltasar heard this, he called for Daniel; and when he had\r\ndiscoursed to him what he had learned concerning him and his wisdom, and\r\nhow a Divine Spirit was with him, and that he alone was fully capable of\r\nfinding out what others would never have thought of, he desired him to\r\ndeclare to him what this writing meant; that if he did so, he would give\r\nhim leave to wear purple, and to put a chain of gold about his neck, and\r\nwould bestow on him the third part of his dominion, as an honorary\r\nreward for his wisdom, that thereby he might become illustrious to those\r\nwho saw him, and who inquired upon what occasion he obtained such\r\nhonors. But Daniel desired that he would keep his gifts to himself; for\r\nwhat is the effect of wisdom and of Divine revelation admits of no\r\ngifts, and bestows its advantages on petitioners freely; but that still\r\nhe would explain the writing to him; which denoted that he should soon\r\ndie, and this because he had not learnt to honor God, and not to admit\r\nthings above human nature, by what punishments his progenitor had\r\nundergone for the injuries he had offered to God; and because he had\r\nquite forgotten how Nebuchadnezzar was removed to feed among wild beasts\r\nfor his impieties, and did not recover his former life among men and his\r\nkingdom, but upon God's mercy to him, after many supplications and\r\nprayers; who did thereupon praise God all the days of his life, as one\r\nof almighty power, and who takes care of mankind. [He also put him in\r\nmind] how he had greatly blasphemed against God, and had made use of his\r\nvessels amongst his concubines; that therefore God saw this, and was\r\nangry with him, and declared by this writing beforehand what a sad\r\nconclusion of his life he should come to. And he explained the writing\r\nthus: \"MANEH. This, if it be expounded in the Greek language, may\r\nsignify a Number, because God hath numbered so long a time for thy life,\r\nand for thy government, and that there remains but a small portion.\r\nTHEKEL This signifies a weight, and means that God hath weighed thy\r\nkingdom in a balance, and finds it going down already.—PHARES. This\r\nalso, in the Greek tongue, denotes a fragment. God will therefore break\r\nthy kingdom in pieces, and divide it among the Medes and Persians.\"\r\n\r\n4. When Daniel had told the king that the writing upon the wall\r\nsignified these events, Baltasar was in great sorrow and affliction, as\r\nwas to be expected, when the interpretation was so heavy upon him.\r\nHowever, he did not refuse what he had promised Daniel, although he were\r\nbecome a foreteller of misfortunes to him, but bestowed it all upon him;\r\nas reasoning thus, that what he was to reward was peculiar to himself,\r\nand to fate, and did not belong to the prophet, but that it was the part\r\nof a good and a just man to give what he had promised, although the\r\nevents were of a melancholy nature. Accordingly, the king determined so\r\nto do. Now, after a little while, both himself and the city were taken\r\nby Cyrus, the king of Persia, who fought against him; for it was\r\nBaltasar, under whom Babylon was taken, when he had reigned seventeen\r\nyears. And this is the end of the posterity of king Nebuchadnezzar, as\r\nhistory informs us; but when Babylon was taken by Darius, and when he,\r\nwith his kinsman Cyrus, had put an end to the dominion of the\r\nBabylonians, he was sixty-two years old. He was the son of Astyages, and\r\nhad another name among the Greeks. Moreover, he took Daniel the prophet,\r\nand carried him with him into Media, and honored him very greatly, and\r\nkept him with him; for he was one of the three presidents whom he set\r\nover his three hundred and sixty provinces, for into so many did Darius\r\npart them.\r\n\r\n5. However, while Daniel was in so great dignity, and in so great favor\r\nwith Darius, and was alone intrusted with every thing by him, a having\r\nsomewhat divine in him, he was envied by the rest; for those that see\r\nothers in greater honor than themselves with kings envy them; and when\r\nthose that were grieved at the great favor Daniel was in with Darius\r\nsought for an occasion against him, he afforded them no occasion at all,\r\nfor he was above all the temptations of money, and despised bribery, and\r\nesteemed it a very base thing to take any thing by way of reward, even\r\nwhen it might be justly given him; he afforded those that envied him not\r\nthe least handle for an accusation. So when they could find nothing for\r\nwhich they might calumniate him to the king, nothing that was shameful\r\nor reproachful, and thereby deprive him of the honor he was in with him,\r\nthey sought for some other method whereby they might destroy him. When\r\ntherefore they saw that Daniel prayed to God three times a day, they\r\nthought they had gotten an occasion by which they might ruin him; so\r\nthey came to Darius and told him that the princes and governors had\r\nthought proper to allow the multitude a relaxation for thirty days, that\r\nno one might offer a petition or prayer either to himself or to the\r\ngods, but that, \"he who shall transgress this decree shall be east into\r\nthe den of lions, and there perish.\"\r\n\r\n6. Whereupon the king, not being acquainted with their wicked design,\r\nnor suspecting that it was a contrivance of theirs against Daniel, said\r\nhe was pleased with this decree of theirs, and he promised to confirm\r\nwhat they desired; he also published an edict to promulgate to the\r\npeople that decree which the princes had made. Accordingly, all the rest\r\ntook care not to transgress those injunctions, and rested in quiet; but\r\nDaniel had no regard to them, but, as he was wont, he stood and prayed\r\nto God in the sight of them all; but the princes having met with the\r\noccasion they so earnestly sought to find against Daniel, came presently\r\nto the king, and accused him, that Daniel was the only person that\r\ntransgressed the decree, while not one of the rest durst pray to their\r\ngods. This discovery they made, not because of his impiety, but because\r\nthey had watched him, and observed him out of envy; for supposing that\r\nDarius did thus out of a greater kindness to him than they expected, and\r\nthat he was ready to grant him pardon for this contempt of his\r\ninjunctions, and envying this very pardon to Daniel, they did not become\r\nmore honorable to him, but desired he might be cast into the den of\r\nlions according to the law. So Darius, hoping that God would deliver\r\nhim, and that he would undergo nothing that was terrible by the wild\r\nbeasts, bid him bear this accident cheerfully. And when he was cast into\r\nthe den, he put his seal to the stone that lay upon the mouth of the\r\nden, and went his way, but he passed all the night without food and\r\nwithout sleep, being in great distress for Daniel; but when it was day,\r\nhe got up, and came to the den, and found the seal entire, which he had\r\nleft the stone sealed withal; he also opened the seal, and cried out,\r\nand called to Daniel, and asked him if he were alive. And as soon as he\r\nheard the king's voice, and said that he had suffered no harm, the king\r\ngave order that he should be drawn up out of the den. Now when his\r\nenemies saw that Daniel had suffered nothing which was terrible, they\r\nwould not own that he was preserved by God, and by his providence; but\r\nthey said that the lions had been filled full with food, and on that\r\naccount it was, as they supposed, that the lions would not touch Daniel,\r\nnor come to him; and this they alleged to the king. But the king, out of\r\nan abhorrence of their wickedness, gave order that they should throw in\r\na great deal of flesh to the lions; and when they had filled themselves,\r\nhe gave further order that Daniel's enemies should be cast into the den,\r\nthat he might learn whether the lions, now they were full, would touch\r\nthem or not. And it appeared plain to Darius, after the princes had been\r\ncast to the wild beasts, that it was God who preserved Daniel 25 for the\r\nlions spared none of them, but tore them all to pieces, as if they had\r\nbeen very hungry, and wanted food. I suppose therefore it was not their\r\nhunger, which had been a little before satisfied with abundance of\r\nflesh, but the wickedness of these men, that provoked them [to destroy\r\nthe princes]; for if it so please God, that wickedness might, by even\r\nthose irrational creatures, be esteemed a plain foundation for their\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n7. When therefore those that had intended thus to destroy Daniel by\r\ntreachery were themselves destroyed, king Darius sent [letters] over all\r\nthe country, and praised that God whom Daniel worshipped, and said that\r\nhe was the only true God, and had all power. He had also Daniel in very\r\ngreat esteem, and made him the principal of his friends. Now when Daniel\r\nwas become so illustrious and famous, on account of the opinion men had\r\nthat he was beloved of God, he built a tower at Ecbatana, in Media: it\r\nwas a most elegant building, and wonderfully made, and it is still\r\nremaining, and preserved to this day; and to such as see it, it appears\r\nto have been lately built, and to have been no older than that very day\r\nwhen any one looks upon it, it is so fresh 26 flourishing, and\r\nbeautiful, and no way grown old in so long time; for buildings suffer\r\nthe same as men do, they grow old as well as they, and by numbers of\r\nyears their strength is dissolved, and their beauty withered. Now they\r\nbury the kings of Media, of Persia, and Parthia in this tower to this\r\nday, and he who was entrusted with the care of it was a Jewish priest;\r\nwhich thing is also observed to this day. But it is fit to give an\r\naccount of what this man did, which is most admirable to hear, for he\r\nwas so happy as to have strange revelations made to him, and those as to\r\none of the greatest of the prophets, insomuch, that while he was alive\r\nhe had the esteem and applause both of the kings and of the multitude;\r\nand now he is dead, he retains a remembrance that will never fail, for\r\nthe several books that he wrote and left behind him are still read by us\r\ntill this time; and from them we believe that Daniel conversed with God;\r\nfor he did not only prophesy of future events, as did the other\r\nprophets, but he also determined the time of their accomplishment. And\r\nwhile prophets used to foretell misfortunes, and on that account were\r\ndisagreeable both to the kings and to the multitude, Daniel was to them\r\na prophet of good things, and this to such a degree, that by the\r\nagreeable nature of his predictions, he procured the goodwill of all\r\nmen; and by the accomplishment of them, he procured the belief of their\r\ntruth, and the opinion of [a sort of] divinity for himself, among the\r\nmultitude. He also wrote and left behind him what made manifest the\r\naccuracy and undeniable veracity of his predictions; for he saith, that\r\nwhen he was in Susa, the metropolis of Persia, and went out into the\r\nfield with his companions, there was, on the sudden, a motion and\r\nconcussion of the earth, and that he was left alone by himself, his\r\nfriends fleeing away from him, and that he was disturbed, and fell on\r\nhis face, and on his two hands, and that a certain person touched him,\r\nand, at the same time, bid him rise, and see what would befall his\r\ncountrymen after many generations. He also related, that when he stood\r\nup, he was shown a great ram, with many horns growing out of his head,\r\nand that the last was higher than the rest: that after this he looked to\r\nthe west, and saw a he-goat carried through the air from that quarter;\r\nthat he rushed upon the ram with violence, and smote him twice with his\r\nhorns, and overthrew him to the ground, and trampled upon him: that\r\nafterward he saw a very great horn growing out of the head of the he-\r\ngoat, and that when it was broken off, four horns grew up that were\r\nexposed to each of the four winds, and he wrote that out of them arose\r\nanother lesser horn, which, as he said, waxed great; and that God showed\r\nto him that it should fight against his nation, and take their city by\r\nforce, and bring the temple worship to confusion, and forbid the\r\nsacrifices to be offered for one thousand two hundred and ninety-six\r\ndays. Daniel wrote that he saw these visions in the Plain of Susa; and\r\nhe hath informed us that God interpreted the appearance of this vision\r\nafter the following manner: He said that the ram signified the kingdoms\r\nof the Medes and Persians, and the horns those kings that were to reign\r\nin them; and that the last horn signified the last king, and that he\r\nshould exceed all the kings in riches and glory: that the he-goat\r\nsignified that one should come and reign from the Greeks, who should\r\ntwice fight with the Persian, and overcome him in battle, and should\r\nreceive his entire dominion: that by the great horn which sprang out of\r\nthe forehead of the he-goat was meant the first king; and that the\r\nspringing up of four horns upon its falling off, and the conversion of\r\nevery one of them to the four quarters of the earth, signified the\r\nsuccessors that should arise after the death of the first king, and the\r\npartition of the kingdom among them, and that they should be neither his\r\nchildren, nor of his kindred, that should reign over the habitable earth\r\nfor many years; and that from among them there should arise a certain\r\nking that should overcome our nation and their laws, and should take\r\naway their political government, and should spoil the temple, and forbid\r\nthe sacrifices to be offered for three years' time. And indeed it so\r\ncame to pass, that our nation suffered these things under Antiochus\r\nEpiphanes, according to Daniel's vision, and what he wrote many years\r\nbefore they came to pass. In the very same manner Daniel also wrote\r\nconcerning the Roman government, and that our country should be made\r\ndesolate by them. All these things did this man leave in writing, as God\r\nhad showed them to him, insomuch that such as read his prophecies, and\r\nsee how they have been fulfilled, would wonder at the honor wherewith\r\nGod honored Daniel; and may thence discover how the Epicureans are in an\r\nerror, who cast Providence out of human life, and do not believe that\r\nGod takes care of the affairs of the world, nor that the universe is\r\ngoverned and continued in being by that blessed and immortal nature, but\r\nsay that the world is carried along of its own accord, without a ruler\r\nand a curator; which, were it destitute of a guide to conduct it, as\r\nthey imagine, it would be like ships without pilots, which we see\r\ndrowned by the winds, or like chariots without drivers, which are\r\noverturned; so would the world be dashed to pieces by its being carried\r\nwithout a Providence, and so perish, and come to nought. So that, by the\r\nforementioned predictions of Daniel, those men seem to me very much to\r\nerr from the truth, who determine that God exercises no providence over\r\nhuman affairs; for if that were the case, that the world went on by\r\nmechanical necessity, we should not see that all things would come to\r\npass according to his prophecy. Now as to myself, I have so described\r\nthese matters as I have found them and read them; but if any one is\r\ninclined to another opinion about them, let him enjoy his different\r\nsentiments without any blame from me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ This title of great king, both in our Bibles, 2 Kings\r\n18:19; Isaiah 36:4, and here in Josephus, is the very same that\r\nHerodotus gives this Sennacherib, as Spanheim takes notice on this\r\nplace.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ What Josephus says here, how Isaiah the prophet assured\r\nHezekiah that \"at this time he should not be besieged by the king of\r\nAssyria; that for the future he might be secure of being not at all\r\ndisturbed by him; and that [afterward] the people might go on peaceably,\r\nand without fear, with their husbandry and other affairs,\" is more\r\ndistinct in our other copies, both of the Kings and of Isaiah, and\r\ndeserves very great consideration. The words are these: \"This shall be a\r\nsign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself, and\r\nthe second year that which springeth of the same; and in the third year\r\nsow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof,\" 2\r\nKings 19:29; Isaiah 37:30; which seem to me plainly to design a Sabbatic\r\nyear, a year of jubilee next after it, and the succeeding usual labors\r\nand fruits of them on the third and following years.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ That this terrible calamity of the slaughter of the 185,000\r\nAssyrians is here delivered in the words of Berosus the Chaldean, and\r\nthat it was certainly and frequently foretold by the Jewish prophets,\r\nand that it was certainly and undeniably accomplished, see Authent. Rec.\r\npart II. p. 858. We are here to take notice, that these two sons of\r\nSennacherib, that ran away into Armenia, became the heads of two famous\r\nfamilies there, the Arzerunii and the Genunii; of which see the\r\nparticular histories in Moses Chorenensis, p. 60.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ Josephus, and all our copies, place the sickness of\r\nHezekiah after the destruction of Sennacherib's army, because it appears\r\nto have been after his first assault, as he was going into Arabia and\r\nEgypt, where he pushed his conquests as far as they would go, and in\r\norder to despatch his story altogether; yet does no copy but this of\r\nJosephus say it was after that destruction, but only that it happened in\r\nthose days, or about that time of Hezekiah's life. Nor will the fifteen\r\nyears' prolongation of his life after his sickness, allow that sickness\r\nto have been later than the former part of the fifteenth year of his\r\nreign, since chronology does not allow him in all above twenty-nine\r\nyears and a few months; whereas the first assault of Sennacherib was on\r\nthe fourteenth year of Hezekiah, but the destruction of Sennacherib's\r\narmy was not till his eighteenth year.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 (return) [ As to this regress of the shadow, either upon a sun-dial,\r\nor the steps of the royal palace built by Ahaz, whether it were\r\nphysically done by the real miraculous revolution of the earth in its\r\ndiurnal motion backward from east to west for a while, and its return\r\nagain to its old natural revolution from west to east; or whether it\r\nwere not apparent only, and performed by an aerial phosphorus, which\r\nimitated the sun's motion backward, while a cloud hid the real sun;\r\ncannot now be determined. Philosophers and astronomers will naturally\r\nincline to the latter hypothesis. However, it must be noted, that\r\nJosephus seems to have understood it otherwise than we generally do,\r\nthat the shadow was accelerated as much at first forward as it was made\r\nto go backward afterward, and so the day was neither longer nor shorter\r\nthan usual; which, it must be confessed agrees best of all to astronomy,\r\nwhose eclipses, older than the time were observed at the same times of\r\nthe day as if this miracle had never happened. After all, this wonderful\r\nsignal was not, it seems, peculiar to Judea, but either seen, or at\r\nleast heard of, at Babylon also, as appears by 2 Chronicles 32:31, where\r\nwe learn that the Babylonian ambassadors were sent to Hezekiah, among\r\nother things, to inquire of the wonder that was done in the land.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 (return) [ This expression of Josephus, that the Medes, upon this\r\ndestruction of the Assyrian army, \"overthrew\" the Assyrian empire, seems\r\nto be too strong; for although they immediately cast off the Assrian\r\nyoke, and set up Deioces, a king of their own, yet it was some time\r\nbefore the Medes and Babylonians overthrew Nineveh, and some generations\r\nere the Medes and Persians under Cyaxares and Cyrus overthrew the\r\nAssyrian or Babylonian empire, and took Babylon.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 (return) [ It is hard to reconcile the account in the Second Book of\r\nKings [Footnote ch. 23:11: with this account in Josephus, and to\r\ntranslate this passage truly in Josephus, whose copies are supposed to\r\nbe here imperfect.

B. VII. ch.\r\n25., of so many prophetic years also, though he withal lets us know, by\r\nhis hint at the interpretation of the seventy weeks, as belonging to the\r\nfourth monarchy, and the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in the\r\ndays of Josephus, ch. 2. sect. 7, that he did not think those years to\r\nbe bare years, but rather days for years; by which reckoning, and by\r\nwhich alone, could seventy weeks, or four hundred and ninety days, reach\r\nto the age of Josephus. But as to the truth of those seven years'\r\nbanishment of Nebuchadnezzar from men, and his living so long among the\r\nbeasts, the very small remains we have any where else of this\r\nNebuchadnezzar prevent our expectation of any other full account of it.\r\nSo far we knew by Ptolemy's canon, a contemporary record, as well as by\r\nJosephus presently, that he reigned in all forty-three years, that is,\r\neight years after we meet with any account of his actions; one of the\r\nlast of which was the thirteen years' siege of Tyre, Antiq. B. XI. ch.\r\n11., where yet the Old Latin has but three years and ten months: yet\r\nwere his actions before so remarkable, both in sacred and profane\r\nauthors, that a vacuity of eight years at the least, at the latter end\r\nof his reign, must be allowed to agree very well with Daniel's accounts;\r\nthat after a seven years' brutal life, he might return to his reason,\r\nand to the exercise of his royal authority, for one whole year at least\r\nbefore his death.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20 (return) [ These forty-three years for the duration of the reign of\r\nNebuchadnezzar are, as I have just now observed, the very same number in\r\nPtolemy's canon.

And note here, that what Dr. Prideaux\r\nsays, at the year, that Nebuchadnezzar must have been a common name of\r\nother kings of Babylon, besides the great Nebuchadnezzar himself is a\r\ngroundless mistake of some modern chronologers rely, and destitute of\r\nall proper original authority.]\r\n\r\n\r\n22 (return) [ These fifteen days for finishing such vast buildings at\r\nBabylon, in Josephus's copy of Berosus, would seem too absurd to be\r\nsupposed to be the true number, were it not for the same testimony\r\nextant also in the first book against Apion, sect. 19, with the same\r\nnumber. It thence indeed appears that Josephus's copy of Berosus had\r\nthis small number, but that it is the true number I still doubt.\r\nJosephus assures us, that the walls of so much a smaller city as\r\nJerusalem were two years and four months in building by Nehemiah, who\r\nyet hastened the work all he could, Antiq. B. XI. ch. 5. sect. 8. I\r\nshould think one hundred and fifteen days, or a year and fifteen days,\r\nmuch more proportionable to so great a work.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23 (return) [ It is here remarkable that Josephus, without the knowledge\r\nof Ptolemy's canon, should call the same king whom he himself here [Bar.\r\ni. 11, and Daniel 5:1, 2, 9, 12, 22, 29, 39: styles Beltazar, or\r\nBelshazzar, from the Babylonian god Bel, Naboandelus also; and in the\r\nfirst book against Apion, sect. 19, vol. iii., from the same citation\r\nout of Berosus, Nabonnedon, from the Babylonian god Nabo or Nebo. This\r\nlast is not remote from the original pronunciation itself in Ptolemy's\r\ncanon, Nabonadius; for both the place of this king in that canon, as the\r\nlast of the Assyrian or Babylonian kings, and the number of years of his\r\nreign, seventeen, the same in both demonstrate that it is one and the\r\nsame king that is meant by them all. It is also worth noting, that\r\nJosephus knew that Darius, the partner of Cyrus, was the son of\r\nAstyages, and was called by another name among the Greeks, though it\r\ndoes not appear he knew what that name was, as having never seen the\r\nbest history of this period, which is Xenophon's. But then what\r\nJosephus's present copies say presently, sect. 4, that it was only\r\nwithin no long time after the hand-writing on the wall that Baltasar was\r\nslain, does not so well agree with our copies of Daniel, which say it\r\nwas the same night, Daniel 5:30.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24 (return) [ This grandmother, or mother of Baltasar, the queen dowager\r\nof Babylon, [for she is distinguished from his queen, Daniel 5:10, 13,]\r\nseems to have been the famous Nitocris, who fortified Babylon against\r\nthe Medes and Persians, and, in all probability governed under Baltasar,\r\nwho seems to be a weak and effeminate prince.]\r\n\r\n\r\n25 (return) [ It is no way improbable that Daniel's enemies might\r\nsuggest this reason to the king why the lions did not meddle with him\r\nand that they might suspect the king's kindness to Daniel had procured\r\nthese lions to be so filled beforehand, and that thence it was that he\r\nencouraged Daniel to submit to this experiment, in hopes of coming off\r\nsafe; and that this was the true reason of making so terrible an\r\nexperiment upon those his enemies, and all their families, Daniel 6:21,\r\nthough our other copies do not directly take notice of it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n26 (return) [ What Josephus here says, that the stones of the sepulchers\r\nof the kings of Persia at this tower, or those perhaps of the same sort\r\nthat are now commonly called the ruins of Persepolis, continued so\r\nentire and unaltered in his days, as if they were lately put there, \"I\r\n[says Reland] here can show to be true, as to those stones of the\r\nPersian mansoleum, which Com.

Containing The Interval Of Two Hundred And Fifty-Three Years\r\nAnd Five Months.—From The First Of Cyrus To The Death Of Alexander The\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. How Cyrus, King Of The Persians, Delivered The Jews Out Of\r\nBabylon And Suffered Them To Return To Their Own Country And To Build\r\nTheir Temple, For Which Work He Gave Them Money.\r\n\r\n1. In the first year of the reign of Cyrus 1 which was the seventieth\r\nfrom the day that our people were removed out of their own land into\r\nBabylon, God commiserated the captivity and calamity of these poor\r\npeople, according as he had foretold to them by Jeremiah the prophet,\r\nbefore the destruction of the city, that after they had served\r\nNebuchadnezzar and his posterity, and after they had undergone that\r\nservitude seventy years, he would restore them again to the land of\r\ntheir fathers, and they should build their temple, and enjoy their\r\nancient prosperity. And these things God did afford them; for he stirred\r\nup the mind of Cyrus, and made him write this throughout all Asia: \"Thus\r\nsaith Cyrus the king: Since God Almighty hath appointed me to be king of\r\nthe habitable earth, I believe that he is that God which the nation of\r\nthe Israelites worship; for indeed he foretold my name by the prophets,\r\nand that I should build him a house at Jerusalem, in the country of\r\nJudea.\"\r\n\r\n2. This was known to Cyrus by his reading the book which Isaiah left\r\nbehind him of his prophecies; for this prophet said that God had spoken\r\nthus to him in a secret vision: \"My will is, that Cyrus, whom I have\r\nappointed to be king over many and great nations, send back my people to\r\ntheir own land, and build my temple.\" This was foretold by Isaiah one\r\nhundred and forty years before the temple was demolished. Accordingly,\r\nwhen Cyrus read this, and admired the Divine power, an earnest desire\r\nand ambition seized upon him to fulfill what was so written; so he\r\ncalled for the most eminent Jews that were in Babylon, and said to them,\r\nthat he gave them leave to go back to their own country, and to rebuild\r\ntheir city Jerusalem, 2 and the temple of God, for that he would be\r\ntheir assistant, and that he would write to the rulers and governors\r\nthat were in the neighborhood of their country of Judea, that they\r\nshould contribute to them gold and silver for the building of the\r\ntemple, and besides that, beasts for their sacrifices.\r\n\r\n3. When Cyrus had said this to the Israelites, the rulers of the two\r\ntribes of Judah and Benjamin, with the Levites and priests, went in\r\nhaste to Jerusalem; yet did many of them stay at Babylon, as not willing\r\nto leave their possessions; and when they were come thither, all the\r\nking's friends assisted them, and brought in, for the building of the\r\ntemple, some gold, and some silver, and some a great many cattle and\r\nhorses. So they performed their vows to God, and offered the sacrifices\r\nthat had been accustomed of old time; I mean this upon the rebuilding of\r\ntheir city, and the revival of the ancient practices relating to their\r\nworship. Cyrus also sent back to them the vessels of God which king\r\nNebuchadnezzar had pillaged out of the temple, and had carried to\r\nBabylon. So he committed these things to Mithridates, the treasurer, to\r\nbe sent away, with an order to give them to Sanabassar, that he might\r\nkeep them till the temple was built; and when it was finished, he might\r\ndeliver them to the priests and rulers of the multitude, in order to\r\ntheir being restored to the temple. Cyrus also sent an epistle to the\r\ngovernors that were in Syria, the contents whereof here follow:\r\n\r\n\"King Cyrus To Sisinnes And Sathrabuzanes Sendeth Greeting.\r\n\r\n\"I have given leave to as many of the Jews that dwell in my country as\r\nplease to return to their own country, and to rebuild their city, and to\r\nbuild the temple of God at Jerusalem on the same place where it was\r\nbefore. I have also sent my treasurer Mithridates, and Zorobabel, the\r\ngovernor of the Jews, that they may lay the foundations of the temple,\r\nand may build it sixty cubits high, and of the same latitude, making\r\nthree edifices of polished stones, and one of the wood of the country,\r\nand the same order extends to the altar whereon they offer sacrifices to\r\nGod. I require also that the expenses for these things may be given out\r\nof my revenues. Moreover, I have also sent the vessels which king\r\nNebuchadnezzar pillaged out of the temple, and have given them to\r\nMithridates the treasurer, and to Zorobabel the governor of the Jews,\r\nthat they may have them carried to Jerusalem, and may restore them to\r\nthe temple of God. Now their number is as follows: Fifty chargers of\r\ngold, and five hundred of silver; forty Thericlean cups of gold, and\r\nfive hundred of silver; fifty basons of gold, and five hundred of\r\nsilver; thirty vessels for pouring [the drink-offerings], and three\r\nhundred of silver; thirty vials of gold, and two thousand four hundred\r\nof silver; with a thousand other large vessels. 3 I permit them to have\r\nthe same honor which they were used to have from their forefathers, as\r\nalso for their small cattle, and for wine and oil, two hundred and five\r\nthousand and five hundred drachmae; and for wheat flour, twenty thousand\r\nand five hundred artabae; and I give order that these expenses shall be\r\ngiven them out of the tributes due from Samaria. The priests shall also\r\noffer these sacrifices according to the laws of Moses in Jerusalem; and\r\nwhen they offer them, they shall pray to God for the preservation of the\r\nking and of his family, that the kingdom of Persia may continue. But my\r\nwill is, that those who disobey these injunctions, and make them void,\r\nshall be hung upon a cross, and their substance brought into the king's\r\ntreasury.\" And such was the import of this epistle. Now the number of\r\nthose that came out of captivity to Jerusalem, were forty-two thousand\r\nfour hundred and sixty-two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How Upon The Death Of Cyrus The Jews Were Hindered In\r\nBuilding Of The Temple By The Cutheans, And The Neighboring Governors;\r\nAnd How Cambyses Entirely Forbade The Jews To Do Any Such Thing.\r\n\r\n1. When the foundations of the temple were laying, and when the Jews\r\nwere very zealous about building it, the neighboring nations, and\r\nespecially the Cutheans, whom Shalmanezer, king of Assyria, had brought\r\nout of Persia and Media, and had planted in Samaria, when he carried the\r\npeople of Israel captives, besought the governors, and those that had\r\nthe care of such affairs, that they would interrupt the Jews, both in\r\nthe rebuilding of their city, and in the building of their temple. Now\r\nas these men were corrupted by them with money, they sold the Cutheans\r\ntheir interest for rendering this building a slow and a careless work,\r\nfor Cyrus, who was busy about other wars, knew nothing of all this; and\r\nit so happened, that when he had led his army against the Massagetae, he\r\nended his life. 4 But when Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, had taken the\r\nkingdom, the governors in Syria, and Phoenicia, and in the countries of\r\nAmmon, and Moab, and Samaria, wrote an epistle to Cambyses; whose\r\ncontents were as follow: \"To our lord Cambyses. We thy servants,\r\nRathumus the historiographer, and Semellius the scribe, and the rest\r\nthat are thy judges in Syria and Phoenicia, send greeting. It is fit, O\r\nking, that thou shouldst know that those Jews which were carried to\r\nBabylon are come into our country, and are building that rebellious and\r\nwicked city, and its market-places, and setting up its walls, and\r\nraising up the temple; know therefore, that when these things are\r\nfinished, they will not be willing to pay tribute, nor will they submit\r\nto thy commands, but will resist kings, and will choose rather to rule\r\nover others than be ruled over themselves. We therefore thought it\r\nproper to write to thee, O king, while the works about the temple are\r\ngoing on so fast, and not to overlook this matter, that thou mayst\r\nsearch into the books of thy fathers, for thou wilt find in them that\r\nthe Jews have been rebels, and enemies to kings, as hath their city been\r\nalso, which, for that reason, hath been till now laid waste. We thought\r\nproper also to inform thee of this matter, because thou mayst otherwise\r\nperhaps be ignorant of it, that if this city be once inhabited and be\r\nentirely encompassed with walls, thou wilt be excluded from thy passage\r\nto Celesyria and Phoenicia.\"\r\n\r\n2. When Cambyses had read the epistle, being naturally wicked, he was\r\nirritated at what they told him, and wrote back to them as follows:\r\n\"Cambyses the king, to Rathumus the historiographer, to Beeltethmus, to\r\nSemellius the scribe, and the rest that are in commission, and dwelling\r\nin Samaria and Phoenicia, after this manner: I have read the epistle\r\nthat was sent from you; and I gave order that the books of my\r\nforefathers should be searched into, and it is there found that this\r\ncity hath always been an enemy to kings, and its inhabitants have raised\r\nseditions and wars. We also are sensible that their kings have been\r\npowerful and tyrannical, and have exacted tribute of Celesyria and\r\nPhoenicia. Wherefore I gave order, that the Jews shall not be permitted\r\nto build that city, lest such mischief as they used to bring upon kings\r\nbe greatly augmented.\" When this epistle was read, Rathumus, and\r\nSemellius the scribe, and their associates, got suddenly on horseback,\r\nand made haste to Jerusalem; they also brought a great company with\r\nthem, and forbade the Jews to build the city and the temple.\r\nAccordingly, these works were hindered from going on till the second\r\nyear of the reign of Darius, for nine years more; for Cambyses reigned\r\nsix years, and within that time overthrew Egypt, and when he was come\r\nback, he died at Damascus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How After The Death Of Cambyses And The Slaughter Of The Magi\r\nBut Under The Reign Of Darius, Zorobabel Was Superior To The Rest In The\r\nSolution Of Problems And Thereby Obtained This Favor Of The King, That\r\nThe Temple Should Be Built.\r\n\r\n1. After the slaughter of the Magi, who, upon the death of Cambyses,\r\nattained the government of the Persians for a year, those families which\r\nwere called the seven families of the Persians appointed Darius, the son\r\nof Hystaspes, to be their king. Now he, while he was a private man, had\r\nmade a vow to God, that if he came to be king, he would send all the\r\nvessels of God that were in Babylon to the temple at Jerusalem. Now it\r\nso fell out, that about this time Zorobabel, who had been made governor\r\nof the Jews that had been in captivity, came to Darius, from Jerusalem;\r\nfor there had been an old friendship between him and the king. He was\r\nalso, with two others, thought worthy to be guard of the king's body;\r\nand obtained that honor which he hoped for.\r\n\r\n2. Now, in the first year of the king's reign, Darius feasted those that\r\nwere about him, and those born in his house, with the rulers of the\r\nMedes, and princes of the Persians, and the toparchs of India and\r\nEthiopia, and the generals of the armies of his hundred and twenty-seven\r\nprovinces. But when they had eaten and drunk to satiety, and abundantly,\r\nthey every one departed to go to bed at their own houses, and Darius the\r\nking went to bed; but after he had rested a little part of the night, he\r\nawaked, and not being able to sleep any more, he fell into conversation\r\nwith the three guards of his body, and promised, that to him who should\r\nmake an oration about points that he should inquire of, such as should\r\nbe most agreeable to truth, and to the dictates of wisdom, he would\r\ngrant it as a reward of his victory, to put on a purple garment, and to\r\ndrink in cups of gold, and to sleep upon gold, and to have a chariot\r\nwith bridles of gold, and a head tire of fine linen, and a chain of gold\r\nabout his neck, and to sit next to himself, on account of his wisdom;\r\n\"and,\" says he, \"he shall be called my cousin.\" Now when he had promised\r\nto give them these gifts, he asked the first of them, \"Whether wine was\r\nnot the strongest?\"—the second, \"Whether kings were not such?\"—and the\r\nthird, \"Whether women were not such? or whether truth was not the\r\nstrongest of all?\" When he had proposed that they should make their\r\ninquiries about these problems, he went to rest; but in the morning he\r\nsent for his great men, his princes, and toparchs of Persia and Media,\r\nand set himself down in the place where he used to give audience, and\r\nbid each of the guards of his body to declare what they thought proper\r\nconcerning the proposed questions, in the hearing of them all.\r\n\r\n3. Accordingly, the first of them began to speak of the strength of\r\nwine, and demonstrated it thus: \"When,\" said he, \"I am to give my\r\nopinion of wine, O you men, I find that it exceeds every thing, by the\r\nfollowing indications: It deceives the mind of those that drink it, and\r\nreduces that of the king to the same state with that of the orphan, and\r\nhe who stands in need of a tutor; and erects that of the slave to the\r\nboldness of him that is free; and that of the needy becomes like that of\r\nthe rich man, for it changes and renews the souls of men when it gets\r\ninto them; and it quenches the sorrow of those that are under\r\ncalamities, and makes men forget the debts they owe to others, and makes\r\nthem think themselves to be of all men the richest; it makes them talk\r\nof no small things, but of talents, and such other names as become\r\nwealthy men only; nay more, it makes them insensible of their\r\ncommanders, and of their kings, and takes away the remembrance of their\r\nfriends and companions, for it arms men even against those that are\r\ndearest to them, and makes them appear the greatest strangers to them;\r\nand when they are become sober, and they have slept out their wine in\r\nthe night, they arise without knowing any thing they have done in their\r\ncups. I take these for signs of power, and by them discover that wine is\r\nthe strongest and most insuperable of all things.\"\r\n\r\n4. As soon as the first had given the forementioned demonstrations of\r\nthe strength of wine, he left off; and the next to him began to speak\r\nabout the strength of a king, and demonstrated that it was the strongest\r\nof all, and more powerful than any thing else that appears to have any\r\nforce or wisdom. He began his demonstration after the following manner;\r\nand said, \"They are men who govern all things; they force the earth and\r\nthe sea to become profitable to them in what they desire, and over these\r\nmen do kings rule, and over them they have authority. Now those who rule\r\nover that animal which is of all the strongest and most powerful, must\r\nneeds deserve to be esteemed insuperable in power and force. For\r\nexample, when these kings command their subjects to make wars, and\r\nundergo dangers, they are hearkened to; and when they send them against\r\ntheir enemies, their power is so great that they are obeyed. They\r\ncommand men to level mountains, and to pull down walls and towers; nay,\r\nwhen they are commanded to be killed and to kill, they submit to it,\r\nthat they may not appear to transgress the king's commands; and when\r\nthey have conquered, they bring what they have gained in the war to the\r\nking. Those also who are not soldiers, but cultivate the ground, and\r\nplough it, and when, after they have endured the labor and all the\r\ninconveniences of such works of husbandry, they have reaped and gathered\r\nin their fruits, they bring tributes to the king; and whatsoever it is\r\nwhich the king says or commands, it is done of necessity, and that\r\nwithout any delay, while he in the mean time is satiated with all sorts\r\nof food and pleasures, and sleeps in quiet. He is guarded by such as\r\nwatch, and such as are, as it were, fixed down to the place through\r\nfear; for no one dares leave him, even when he is asleep, nor does any\r\none go away and take care of his own affairs; but he esteems this one\r\nthing the only work of necessity, to guard the king, and accordingly to\r\nthis he wholly addicts himself. How then can it be otherwise, but that\r\nit must appear that the king exceeds all in strength, while so great a\r\nmultitude obeys his injunctions?\"\r\n\r\n5. Now when this man had held his peace, the third of them, who was\r\nZorobabel, began to instruct them about women, and about truth, who said\r\nthus: \"Wine is strong, as is the king also, whom all men obey, but women\r\nare superior to them in power; for it was a woman that brought the king\r\ninto the world; and for those that plant the vines and make the wine,\r\nthey are women who bear them, and bring them up: nor indeed is there any\r\nthing which we do not receive from them; for these women weave garments\r\nfor us, and our household affairs are by their means taken care of, and\r\npreserved in safety; nor can we live separate from women. And when we\r\nhave gotten a great deal of gold and silver, and any other thing that is\r\nof great value, and deserving regard, and see a beautiful woman, we\r\nleave all these things, and with open mouth fix our eyes upon her\r\ncountenance, and are willing to forsake what we have, that we may enjoy\r\nher beauty, and procure it to ourselves. We also leave father, and\r\nmother, and the earth that nourishes us, and frequently forget our\r\ndearest friends, for the sake of women; nay, we are so hardy as to lay\r\ndown our lives for them. But what will chiefly make you take notice of\r\nthe strength of women is this that follows: Do not we take pains, and\r\nendure a great deal of trouble, and that both by land and sea, and when\r\nwe have procured somewhat as the fruit of our labors, do not we bring\r\nthem to the women, as to our mistresses, and bestow them upon them? Nay,\r\nI once saw the king, who is lord of so many people, smitten on the face\r\nby Apame, the daughter of Rabsases Themasius, his concubine, and his\r\ndiadem taken away from him, and put upon her own head, while he bore it\r\npatiently; and when she smiled he smiled, and when she was angry he was\r\nsad; and according to the change of her passions, he flattered his wife,\r\nand drew her to reconciliation by the great humiliation of himself to\r\nher, if at any time he saw her displeased at him.\"\r\n\r\n6. And when the princes and rulers looked one upon another, he began to\r\nspeak about truth; and he said, \"I have already demonstrated how\r\npowerful women are; but both these women themselves, and the king\r\nhimself, are weaker than truth; for although the earth be large, and the\r\nheaven high, and the course of the sun swift, yet are all these moved\r\naccording to the will of God, who is true and righteous, for which cause\r\nwe also ought to esteem truth to be the strongest of all things, and\r\nthat what is unrighteous is of no force against it. Moreover, all things\r\nelse that have any strength are mortal and short-lived, but truth is a\r\nthing that is immortal and eternal. It affords us not indeed such a\r\nbeauty as will wither away by time, nor such riches as may be taken away\r\nby fortune, but righteous rules and laws. It distinguishes them from\r\ninjustice, and puts what is unrighteous to rebuke.\" 5\r\n\r\n7. So when Zorobabel had left off his discourse about truth, and the\r\nmultitude had cried out aloud that he had spoken the most wisely, and\r\nthat it was truth alone that had immutable strength, and such as never\r\nwould wax old, the king commanded that he should ask for somewhat over\r\nand above what he had promised, for that he would give it him because of\r\nhis wisdom, and that prudence wherein he exceeded the rest; \"and thou\r\nshalt sit with me,\" said the king, \"and shalt be called my cousin.\" When\r\nhe had said this, Zorobabel put him in mind of the vow he had made in\r\ncase he should ever have the kingdom. Now this vow was, \"to rebuild\r\nJerusalem, and to build therein the temple of God; as also to restore\r\nthe vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged, and carried to Babylon.\r\nAnd this,\" said he, \"is that request which thou now permittest me to\r\nmake, on account that I have been judged to be wise and understanding.\"\r\n\r\n8. So the king was pleased with what he had said, and arose and kissed\r\nhim; and wrote to the toparchs and governors, and enjoined them to\r\nconduct Zorobabel and those that were going with him to build the\r\ntemple. He also sent letters to those rulers that were in Syria and\r\nPhoenicia to cut down and carry cedar trees from Lebanon to Jerusalem,\r\nand to assist him in building the city. He also wrote to them, that all\r\nthe captives who should go to Judea should be free; and he prohibited\r\nhis deputies and governors to lay any king's taxes upon the Jews; he\r\nalso permitted that they should have all that land which they could\r\npossess themselves of without tributes. He also enjoined the Idumeans\r\nand Samaritans, and the inhabitants of Celesyria, to restore those\r\nvillages which they had taken from the Jews; and that, besides all this,\r\nfifty talents should be given them for the building of the temple. He\r\nalso permitted them to offer their appointed sacrifices, and that\r\nwhatsoever the high priest and the priests wanted, and those sacred\r\ngarments wherein they used to worship God, should be made at his own\r\ncharges; and that the musical instruments which the Levites used in\r\nsinging hymns to God should be given them. Moreover, he charged them,\r\nthat portions of land should be given to those that guarded the city and\r\nthe temple, as also a determinate sum of money every year for their\r\nmaintenance; and withal he sent the vessels. And all that Cyrus intended\r\nto do before him relating to the restoration of Jerusalem, Darius also\r\nordained should be done accordingly.\r\n\r\n9. Now when Zorobabel had obtained these grants from the king, he went\r\nout of the palace, and looking up to heaven, he began to return thanks\r\nto God for the wisdom he had given him, and the victory he had gained\r\nthereby, even in the presence of Darius himself; for, said he, \"I had\r\nnot been thought worthy of these advantages, O Lord, unless thou hadst\r\nbeen favorable to me.\" When therefore he had returned these thanks to\r\nGod for the present circumstances he was in, and had prayed to him to\r\nafford him the like favor for the time to come, he came to Babylon, and\r\nbrought the good news to his countrymen of what grants he had procured\r\nfor them from the king; who, when they heard the same, gave thanks also\r\nto God that he restored the land of their forefathers to them again. So\r\nthey betook themselves to drinking and eating, and for seven days they\r\ncontinued feasting, and kept a festival, for the rebuilding and\r\nrestoration of their country: after this they chose themselves rulers,\r\nwho should go up to Jerusalem, out of the tribes of their forefathers,\r\nwith their wives, and children, and cattle, who traveled to Jerusalem\r\nwith joy and pleasure, under the conduct of those whom Darius sent along\r\nwith them, and making a noise with songs, and pipes, and cymbals. The\r\nrest of the Jewish multitude also besides accompanied them with\r\nrejoicing.\r\n\r\n10. And thus did these men go, a certain and determinate number out of\r\nevery family, though I do not think it proper to recite particularly the\r\nnames of those families, that I may not take off the mind of my readers\r\nfrom the connexion of the historical facts, and make it hard for them to\r\nfollow the coherence of my narrations; but the sum of those that went\r\nup, above the age of twelve years, of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin,\r\nwas four hundred and sixty-two myriads and eight thousand 6 the Levites\r\nwere seventy-four; the number of the women and children mixed together\r\nwas forty thousand seven hundred and forty-two; and besides these, there\r\nwere singers of the Levites one hundred and twenty-eight, and porters\r\none hundred and ten, and of the sacred ministers three hundred and\r\nninety-two; there were also others besides these, who said they were of\r\nthe Israelites, but were not able to show their genealogies, six hundred\r\nand sixty-two: some there were also who were expelled out of the number\r\nand honor of the priests, as having married wives whose genealogies they\r\ncould not produce, nor were they found in the genealogies of the Levites\r\nand priests; they were about five hundred and twenty-five: the multitude\r\nalso of servants that followed those that went up to Jerusalem were\r\nseven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; the singing men and\r\nsinging women were two hundred and forty-five; the camels were four\r\nhundred and thirty-five; the beasts used to the yoke were five thousand\r\nfive hundred and twenty-five; and the governors of all this multitude\r\nthus numbered were Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, of the posterity of\r\nDavid, and of the tribe of Judah; and Jeshua, the son of Josedek the\r\nhigh priest; and besides these there were Mordecai and Serebeus, who\r\nwere distinguished from the multitude, and were rulers, who also\r\ncontributed a hundred pounds of gold, and five thousand of silver. By\r\nthis means therefore the priests and the Levites, and a certain part of\r\nthe entire people of the Jews that were in Babylon, came and dwelt in\r\nJerusalem; but the rest of the multitude returned every one to their own\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How The Temple Was Built While The Cutheans Endeavored In\r\nVain To Obstruct The Work.\r\n\r\n1. Now in the seventh month after they were departed out of Babylon,\r\nboth Jeshua the high priest, and Zorobabel the governor, sent messengers\r\nevery way round about, and gathered those that were in the country\r\ntogether to Jerusalem universally, who came very gladly thither. He then\r\nbuilt the altar on the same place it had formerly been built, that they\r\nmight offer the appointed sacrifices upon it to God, according to the\r\nlaws of Moses. But while they did this, they did not please the\r\nneighboring nations, who all of them bare an ill-will to them. They also\r\ncelebrated the feast of tabernacles at that time, as the legislator had\r\nordained concerning it; and after they offered sacrifices, and what were\r\ncalled the daily sacrifices, and the oblations proper for the Sabbaths,\r\nand for all the holy festivals. Those also that had made vows performed\r\nthem, and offered their sacrifices from the first day of the seventh\r\nmonth. They also began to build the temple, and gave a great deal of\r\nmoney to the masons and to the carpenters, and what was necessary for\r\nthe maintenance of the workmen. The Sidonians also were very willing and\r\nready to bring the cedar trees from Libanus, to bind them together, and\r\nto make a united float of them, and to bring them to the port of Joppa,\r\nfor that was what Cyrus had commanded at first, and what was now done at\r\nthe command of Darius.\r\n\r\n2. In the second year of their coming to Jerusalem, as the Jews were\r\nthere in the second month, the building of the temple went on apace; and\r\nwhen they had laid its foundations on the first day of the second month\r\nof that second year, they set, as overseers of the work, such Levites as\r\nwere full twenty years old; and Jeshua and his sons and brethren, and\r\nCodmiel the brother of Judas, the son of Aminadab, with his sons; and\r\nthe temple, by the great diligence of those that had the care of it, was\r\nfinished sooner than any one would have expected. And when the temple\r\nwas finished, the priests, adorned with their accustomed garments, stood\r\nwith their trumpets, while the Levites, and the sons of Asaph, stood and\r\nsung hymns to God, according as David first of all appointed them to\r\nbless God. Now the priests and Levites, and the elder part of the\r\nfamilies, recollecting with themselves how much greater and more\r\nsumptuous the old temple had been, seeing that now made how much\r\ninferior it was, on account of their poverty, to that which had been\r\nbuilt of old, considered with themselves how much their happy state was\r\nsunk below what it had been of old, as well as their temple. Hereupon\r\nthey were disconsolate, and not able to contain their grief, and\r\nproceeded so far as to lament and shed tears on those accounts; but the\r\npeople in general were contented with their present condition; and\r\nbecause they were allowed to build them a temple, they desired no more,\r\nand neither regarded nor remembered, nor indeed at all tormented\r\nthemselves with the comparison of that and the former temple, as if this\r\nwere below their expectations; but the wailing of the old men and of the\r\npriests, on account of the deficiency of this temple, in their opinion,\r\nif compared with that which had been demolished, overcame the sounds of\r\nthe trumpets and the rejoicing of the people.\r\n\r\n3. But when the Samaritans, who were still enemies to the tribes of\r\nJudah and Benjamin, heard the sound of the trumpets, they came running\r\ntogether, and desired to know what was the occasion of this tumult; and\r\nwhen they perceived that it was from the Jews, who had been carried\r\ncaptive to Babylon, and were rebuilding their temple, they came to\r\nZorobabel and to Jeshua, and to the heads of the families, and desired\r\nthat they would give them leave to build the temple with them, and to be\r\npartners with them in building it; for they said, \"We worship their God,\r\nand especially pray to him, and are desirous of their religious\r\nsettlement, and this ever since Shalmanezer, the king of Assyria,\r\ntransplanted us out of Cuthah and Media to this place.\" When they said\r\nthus, Zorobabel and Jeshua the high priest, and the heads of the\r\nfamilies of the Israelites, replied to them, that it was impossible for\r\nthem to permit them to be their partners, whilst they [only] had been\r\nappointed to build that temple at first by Cyrus, and now by Darius,\r\nalthough it was indeed lawful for them to come and worship there if they\r\npleased, and that they could allow them nothing but that in common with\r\nthem, which was common to them with all other men, to come to their\r\ntemple and worship God there.\r\n\r\n4. When the Cuthearts heard this, for the Samaritans have that\r\nappellation, they had indignation at it, and persuaded the nations of\r\nSyria to desire of the governors, in the same manner as they had done\r\nformerly in the days of Cyrus, and again in the days of Cambyses\r\nafterwards, to put a stop to the building of the temple, and to endeavor\r\nto delay and protract the Jews in their zeal about it. Now at this time\r\nSisinnes, the governor of Syria and Phoenicia, and Sathrabuzanes, with\r\ncertain others, came up to Jerusalem, and asked the rulers of the Jews,\r\nby whose grant it was that they built the temple in this manner, since\r\nit was more like to a citadel than a temple? and for what reason it was\r\nthat they built cloisters and walls, and those strong ones too, about\r\nthe city? To which Zorobabel and Jeshua the high priest replied, that\r\nthey were the servants of God Almighty; that this temple was built for\r\nhim by a king of theirs, that lived in great prosperity, and one that\r\nexceeded all men in virtue; and that it continued a long time, but that\r\nbecause of their fathers' impiety towards God, Nebuchadnezzar, king of\r\nthe Babylonians and of the Chaldeans, took their city by force, and\r\ndestroyed it, and pillaged the temple, and burnt it down, and\r\ntransplanted the people whom he had made captives, and removed them to\r\nBabylon; that Cyrus, who, after him, was king of Babylonia and Persia,\r\nwrote to them to build the temple, and committed the gifts and vessels,\r\nand whatsoever Nebuchadnezzar had carried out of it, to Zorobabel, and\r\nMithridates the treasurer; and gave order to have them carried to\r\nJerusalem, and to have them restored to their own temple, when it was\r\nbuilt; for he had sent to them to have that done speedily, and commanded\r\nSanabassar to go up to Jerusalem, and to take care of the building of\r\nthe temple; who, upon receiving that epistle from Cyrus, came, and\r\nimmediately laid its foundations; \"and although it hath been in building\r\nfrom that time to this, it hath not yet been finished, by reason of the\r\nmalignity of our enemies. If therefore you have a mind, and think it\r\nproper, write this account to Darius, that when he hath consulted the\r\nrecords of the kings, he may find that we have told you nothing that is\r\nfalse about this matter.\"\r\n\r\n5. When Zorobabel and the high priest had made this answer, Sisinnes,\r\nand those that were with him, did not resolve to hinder the building,\r\nuntil they had informed king Darius of all this. So they immediately\r\nwrote to him about these affairs; but as the Jews were now under terror,\r\nand afraid lest the king should change his resolutions as to the\r\nbuilding of Jerusalem and of the temple, there were two prophets at that\r\ntime among them, Haggai and Zechariah, who encouraged them, and bid them\r\nbe of good cheer, and to suspect no discouragement from the Persians,\r\nfor that God foretold this to them. So, in dependence on those prophets,\r\nthey applied themselves earnestly to building, and did not intermit one\r\nday.\r\n\r\n6. Now Darius, when the Samaritans had written to him, and in their\r\nepistle had accused the Jews, how they fortified the city, and built the\r\ntemple more like to a citadel than to a temple; and said, that their\r\ndoings were not expedient for the king's affairs; and besides, they\r\nshowed the epistle of Cambyses, wherein he forbade them to build the\r\ntemple: and when Darius thereby understood that the restoration of\r\nJerusalem was not expedient for his affairs, and when he had read the\r\nepistle that was brought him from Sisinnes, and those that were with\r\nhim, he gave order that what concerned these matters should be sought\r\nfor among the royal records. Whereupon a book was found at Ecbatana, in\r\nthe tower that was in Media, wherein was written as follows: \"Cyrus the\r\nking, in the first year of his reign, commanded that the temple should\r\nbe built in Jerusalem; and the altar in height threescore cubits, and\r\nits breadth of the same, with three edifices of polished stone, and one\r\nedifice of stone of their own country; and he ordained that the expenses\r\nof it should be paid out of the king's revenue. He also commanded that\r\nthe vessels which Nebuchadnezzar had pillaged [out of the temple], and\r\nhad carried to Babylon, should be restored to the people of Jerusalem;\r\nand that the care of these things should belong to Sanabassar, the\r\ngovernor and president of Syria and Phoenicia, and his associates, that\r\nthey may not meddle with that place, but may permit the servants of God,\r\nthe Jews and their rulers, to build the temple. He also ordained that\r\nthey should assist them in the work; and that they should pay to the\r\nJews, out of the tribute of the country where they were governors, on\r\naccount of the sacrifices, bulls, and rams, and lambs, and kids of the\r\ngoats, and fine flour, and oil, and wine, and all other things that the\r\npriests should suggest to them; and that they should pray for the\r\npreservation of the king, and of the Persians; and that for such as\r\ntransgressed any of these orders thus sent to them, he commanded that\r\nthey should be caught, and hung upon a cross, and their substance\r\nconfiscated to the king's use. He also prayed to God against them, that\r\nif any one attempted to hinder the building of the temple, God would\r\nstrike him dead, and thereby restrain his wickedness.\"\r\n\r\n7. When Darius had found this book among the records of Cyrus, he wrote\r\nan answer to Sisinnes and his associates, whose contents were these:\r\n\"King Darius to Sisinnes the governor, and to Sathrabuzanes, sendeth\r\ngreeting. Having found a copy of this epistle among the records of\r\nCyrus, I have sent it you; and I will that all things be done as is\r\ntherein written. Fare ye well.\" So when Sisinnes, and those that were\r\nwith him, understood the intention of the king, they resolved to follow\r\nhis directions entirely for the time to come. So they forwarded the\r\nsacred works, and assisted the elders of the Jews, and the princes of\r\nthe Sanhedrim; and the structure of the temple was with great diligence\r\nbrought to a conclusion, by the prophecies of Haggai and Zechariah,\r\naccording to God's commands, and by the injunctions of Cyrus and Darius\r\nthe kings. Now the temple was built in seven years' time. And in the\r\nninth year of the reign of Darius, on the twenty-third day of the\r\ntwelfth month, which is by us called Adar, but by the Macedonians\r\nDystrus, the priests, and Levites, and the other multitude of the\r\nIsraelites, offered sacrifices, as the renovation of their former\r\nprosperity after their captivity, and because they had now the temple\r\nrebuilt, a hundred bulls, two hundred rains, four hundred lambs, and\r\ntwelve kids of the goats, according to the number of their tribes, [for\r\nso many are the tribes of the Israelites,] and this last for the sins of\r\nevery tribe. The priests also and the Levites set the porters at every\r\ngate, according to the laws of Moses. The Jews also built the cloisters\r\nof the inner temple that were round about the temple itself.\r\n\r\n8. And as the feast of unleavened bread was at hand, in the first month,\r\nwhich, according to the Macedonians, is called Xanthicus, but according\r\nto us Nisan, all the people ran together out of the villages to the\r\ncity, and celebrated the festival, having purified themselves, with\r\ntheir wives and children, according to the law of their country; and\r\nthey offered the sacrifice which was called the Passover, on the\r\nfourteenth day of the same month, and feasted seven days, and spared for\r\nno cost, but offered whole burnt-offerings to God, and performed\r\nsacrifices of thanksgiving, because God had led them again to the land\r\nof their fathers, and to the laws thereto belonging, and had rendered\r\nthe mind of the king of Persia favorable to them. So these men offered\r\nthe largest sacrifices on these accounts, and used great magnificence in\r\nthe worship of God, and dwelt in Jerusalem, and made use of a form of\r\ngovernment that was aristocratical, but mixed with an oligarchy, for the\r\nhigh priests were at the head of their affairs, until the posterity of\r\nthe Asamoneans set up kingly government; for before their captivity, and\r\nthe dissolution of their polity, they at first had kingly government\r\nfrom Saul and David for five hundred and thirty- two years, six months,\r\nand ten days; but before those kings, such rulers governed them as were\r\ncalled judges and monarchs. Under this form of government they continued\r\nfor more than five hundred years after the death of Moses, and of Joshua\r\ntheir commander. And this is the account I had to give of the Jews who\r\nhad been carried into captivity, but were delivered from it in the times\r\nof Cyrus and Darius.\r\n\r\n9. 7 But the Samaritans, being evil and enviously disposed to the Jews,\r\nwrought them many mischiefs, by reliance on their riches, and by their\r\npretense that they were allied to the Persians, on account that thence\r\nthey came; and whatsoever it was that they were enjoined to pay the Jews\r\nby the king's order out of their tributes for the sacrifices, they would\r\nnot pay it. They had also the governors favorable to them, and assisting\r\nthem for that purpose; nor did they spare to hurt them, either by\r\nthemselves or by others, as far as they were able. So the Jews\r\ndetermined to send an embassage to king Darius, in favor of the people\r\nof Jerusalem, and in order to accuse the Samaritans. The ambassadors\r\nwere Zorobabel, and four others of the rulers; and as soon as the king\r\nknew from the ambassadors the accusations and complaints they brought\r\nagainst the Samaritans, he gave them an epistle to be carried to the\r\ngovernors and council of Samaria; the contents of which epistle were\r\nthese: \"King Darius to Tanganas and Sambabas, the governors of the\r\nSainaritans, to Sadraces and Bobelo, and the rest of their fellow\r\nservants that are in Samaria: Zorobabel, Ananias, and Mordecai, the\r\nambassadors of the Jews, complain of you, that you obstruct them in the\r\nbuilding of the temple, and do not supply them with the expenses which I\r\ncommanded you to do for the offering their sacrifices. My will therefore\r\nis this, That upon the reading of this epistle, you supply them with\r\nwhatsoever they want for their sacrifices, and that out of the royal\r\ntreasury, of the tributes of Samaria, as the priest shall desire, that\r\nthey may not leave off offering their daily sacrifices, nor praying to\r\nGod for me and the Persians.\" And these were the contents of that\r\nepistle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How Xerxes The Son Of Darius Was Well Disposed To The Jews;\r\nAs Also Concerning Esdras And Nehemiah.\r\n\r\n1. Upon the death of Darius, Xerxes his son took the kingdom, who, as he\r\ninherited his father's kingdom, so did he inherit his piety towards God,\r\nand honor of him; for he did all things suitably to his father relating\r\nto Divine worship, and he was exceeding friendly to the Jews. Now about\r\nthis time a son of Jeshua, whose name was Joacim, was the high priest.\r\nMoreover, there was now in Babylon a righteous man, and one that enjoyed\r\na great reputation among the multitude. He was the principal priest of\r\nthe people, and his name was Esdras. He was very skillful in the laws of\r\nMoses, and was well acquainted with king Xerxes. He had determined to go\r\nup to Jerusalem, and to take with him some of those Jews that were in\r\nBabylon; and he desired that the king would give him an epistle to the\r\ngovernors of Syria, by which they might know who he was. Accordingly,\r\nthe king wrote the following epistle to those governors: \"Xerxes, king\r\nof kings, to Esdras the priest, and reader of the Divine law, greeting.\r\nI think it agreeable to that love which I bear to mankind, to permit\r\nthose of the Jewish nation that are so disposed, as well as those of the\r\npriests and Levites that are in our kingdom, to go together to\r\nJerusalem. Accordingly, I have given command for that purpose; and let\r\nevery one that hath a mind go, according as it hath seemed good to me,\r\nand to my seven counselors, and this in order to their review of the\r\naffairs of Judea, to see whether they be agreeable to the law of God.\r\nLet them also take with them those presents which I and my friends have\r\nvowed, with all that silver and gold that is found in the country of the\r\nBabylonians, as dedicated to God, and let all this be carried to\r\nJerusalem to God for sacrifices. Let it also be lawful for thee and thy\r\nbrethren to make as many vessels of silver and gold as thou pleasest.\r\nThou shalt also dedicate those holy vessels which have been given thee,\r\nand as many more as thou hast a mind to make, and shall take the\r\nexpenses out of the king's treasury. I have, moreover, written to the\r\ntreasurers of Syria and Phoenicia, that they take care of those affairs\r\nthat Esdras the priest, and reader of the laws of God, is sent about.\r\nAnd that God may not be at all angry with me, or with my children, I\r\ngrant all that is necessary for sacrifices to God, according to the law,\r\nas far as a hundred cori of wheat. And I enjoin you not to lay any\r\ntreacherous imposition, or any tributes, upon their priests or Levites,\r\nor sacred singers, or porters, or sacred servants, or scribes of the\r\ntemple. And do thou, O Esdras, appoint judges according to the wisdom\r\n[given thee] of God, and those such as understand the law, that they may\r\njudge in all Syria and Phoenicia; and do thou instruct those also which\r\nare ignorant of it, that if any one of thy countrymen transgress the law\r\nof God, or that of the king, he may be punished, as not transgressing it\r\nout of ignorance, but as one that knows it indeed, but boldly despises\r\nand contemns it; and such may be punished by death, or by paying fines.\r\nFarewell.\"\r\n\r\n2. When Esdras had received this epistle, he was very joyful, and began\r\nto worship God, and confessed that he had been the cause of the king's\r\ngreat favor to him, and that for the same reason he gave all the thanks\r\nto God. So he read the epistle at Babylon to those Jews that were there;\r\nbut he kept the epistle itself, and sent a copy of it to all those of\r\nhis own nation that were in Media. And when these Jews had understood\r\nwhat piety the king had towards God, and what kindness he had for\r\nEsdras, they were all greatly pleased; nay, many of them took their\r\neffects with them, and came to Babylon, as very desirous of going down\r\nto Jerusalem; but then the entire body of the people of Israel remained\r\nin that country; wherefore there are but two tribes in Asia and Europe\r\nsubject to the Iomans, while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till\r\nnow, and are an immense multitude, and not to be estimated by numbers.\r\nNow there came a great number of priests, and Levites, and porters, and\r\nsacred singers, and sacred servants to Esdras. So he gathered those that\r\nwere in the captivity together beyond Euphrates, and staid there three\r\ndays, and ordained a fast for them, that they might make their prayers\r\nto God for their preservation, that they might suffer no misfortunes by\r\nthe way, either from their enemies, or from any other ill accident; for\r\nEsdras had said beforehand that he had told the king how God would\r\npreserve them, and so he had not thought fit to request that he would\r\nsend horsemen to conduct them. So when they had finished their prayers,\r\nthey removed from Euphrates on the twelfth day of the first month of the\r\nseventh year of the reign of Xerxes, and they came to Jerusalem on the\r\nfifth month of the same year. Now Esdras presented the sacred money to\r\nthe treasurers, who were of the family of the priests, of silver six\r\nhundred and fifty talents, vessels of silver one hundred talents,\r\nvessels of gold twenty talents, vessels of brass, that was more precious\r\nthan gold, 8 twelve talents by weight; for these Presents had been made\r\nby the king and his counselors, and by all the Israelites that staid at\r\nBabylon. So when Esdras had delivered these things to the priests, he\r\ngave to God, as the appointed sacrifices of whole burnt-offerings,\r\ntwelve bulls on account of the common preservation of the people, ninety\r\nrams, seventy-two lambs, and twelve kids of the goats, for the remission\r\nof sins. He also delivered the king's epistle to the king's officers,\r\nand to the governors of Celesyria and Phoenicia; and as they were under\r\na necessity of doing what was enjoined by him, they honored our nation,\r\nand were assistant to them in all their necessities.\r\n\r\n3. Now these things were truly done under the conduct of Esdras; and he\r\nsucceeded in them, because God esteemed him worthy of the success of his\r\nconduct, on account of his goodness and righteousness. But some time\r\nafterward there came some persons to him, and brought an accusation\r\nagainst certain of the multitude, and of the priests and Levites, who\r\nhad transgressed their settlement, and dissolved the laws of their\r\ncountry, by marrying strange wives, and had brought the family of the\r\npriests into confusion. These persons desired him to support the laws,\r\nlest God should take up a general anger against them all, and reduce\r\nthem to a calamitous condition again. Hereupon he rent his garment\r\nimmediately, out of grief, and pulled off the hair of his head and\r\nbeard, and cast himself upon the ground, because this crime had reached\r\nthe principal men among the people; and considering that if he should\r\nenjoin them to cast out their wives, and the children they had by them,\r\nhe should not be hearkened to, he continued lying upon the ground.\r\nHowever, all the better sort came running to him, who also themselves\r\nwept, and partook of the grief he was under for what had been done. So\r\nEsdras rose up from the ground, and stretched out his hands towards\r\nheaven, and said that he was ashamed to look towards it, because of the\r\nsins which the people had committed, while they had cast out of their\r\nmemories what their fathers had undergone on account of their\r\nwickedness; and he besought God, who had saved a seed and a remnant out\r\nof the calamity and captivity they had been in, and had restored them\r\nagain to Jerusalem, and to their own land, and had obliged the kings of\r\nPersia to have compassion on them, that he would also forgive them their\r\nsins they had now committed, which, though they deserved death, yet, was\r\nit agreeable to the mercy of God, to remit even to these the punishment\r\ndue to them.\r\n\r\n4. After Esdras had said this, he left off praying; and when all those\r\nthat came to him with their wives and children were under lamentation,\r\none whose name was Jechonias, a principal man in Jerusalem, came to him,\r\nand said that they had sinned in marrying strange wives; and he\r\npersuaded him to adjure them all to cast those wives out, and the\r\nchildren born of them, and that those should be punished who would not\r\nobey the law. So Esdras hearkened to this advice, and made the heads of\r\nthe priests, and of the Levites, and of the Israelites, swear that they\r\nwould put away those wives and children, according to the advice of\r\nJechonias. And when he had received their oaths, he went in haste out of\r\nthe temple into the chamber of Johanan, the son of Eliasib, and as he\r\nhad hitherto tasted nothing at all for grief, so he abode there that\r\nday. And when proclamation was made, that all those of the captivity\r\nshould gather themselves together to Jerusalem, and those that did not\r\nmeet there in two or three days should be banished from the multitude,\r\nand that their substance should b appropriated to the uses of the\r\ntemple, according to the sentence of the elders, those that were of the\r\ntribes of Judah and Benjamin came together in three days, viz. on the\r\ntwentieth day of the ninth month, which, according to the Hebrews, is\r\ncalled Tebeth, and according to the Macedonians, Apelleius. Now as they\r\nwere sitting in the upper room of the temple, where the elders also were\r\npresent, but were uneasy because of the cold, Esdras stood up and\r\naccused them, and told them that they had sinned in marrying wives that\r\nwere not of their own nation; but that now they would do a thing both\r\npleasing to God, and advantageous to themselves, if they would put those\r\nwives away. Accordingly, they all cried out that they would do so. That,\r\nhowever, the multitude was great, and that the season of the year was\r\nwinter, and that this work would require more than one or two days. \"Let\r\ntheir rulers, therefore, [said they,] and those that have married\r\nstrange wives, come hither at a proper time, while the elders of every\r\nplace, that are in common to estimate the number of those that have thus\r\nmarried, are to be there also.\" Accordingly, this was resolved on by\r\nthem, and they began the inquiry after those that had married strange\r\nwives on the first day of the tenth month, and continued the inquiry to\r\nthe first day of the next month, and found a great many of the posterity\r\nof Jeshua the high priest, and of the priests and Levites, and\r\nIsraelites, who had a greater regard to the observation of the law than\r\nto their natural affection, 9 and immediately cast out their wives, and\r\nthe children which were born of them. And in order to appease God, they\r\noffered sacrifices, and slew rams, as oblations to him; but it does not\r\nseem to me to be necessary to set down the names of these men. So when\r\nEsdras had reformed this sin about the marriages of the forementioned\r\npersons, he reduced that practice to purity, so that it continued in\r\nthat state for the time to come.\r\n\r\n5. Now when they kept the feast of tabernacles in the seventh month 10\r\nand almost all the people were come together to it, they went up to the\r\nopen part of the temple, to the gate which looked eastward, and desired\r\nof Esdras that the laws of Moses might be read to them. Accordingly, he\r\nstood in the midst of the multitude and read them; and this he did from\r\nmorning to noon. Now, by hearing the laws read to them, they were\r\ninstructed to be righteous men for the present and for the future; but\r\nas for their past offenses, they were displeased at themselves, and\r\nproceeded to shed tears on their account, as considering with themselves\r\nthat if they had kept the law, they had endured none of these miseries\r\nwhich they had experienced. But when Esdras saw them in that\r\ndisposition, he bade them go home, and not weep, for that it was a\r\nfestival, and that they ought not to weep thereon, for that it was not\r\nlawful so to do. 11 He exhorted them rather to proceed immediately to\r\nfeasting, and to do what was suitable to a feast, and what was agreeable\r\nto a day of joy; but to let their repentance and sorrow for their former\r\nsins be a security and a guard to them, that they fell no more into the\r\nlike offenses. So upon Esdras's exhortation they began to feast; and\r\nwhen they had so done for eight days, in their tabernacles, they\r\ndeparted to their own homes, singing hymns to God, and returning thanks\r\nto Esdras for his reformation of what corruptions had been introduced\r\ninto their settlement. So it came to pass, that after he had obtained\r\nthis reputation among the people, he died an old man, and was buried in\r\na magnificent manner at Jerusalem. About the same time it happened also\r\nthat Joacim, the high priest, died; and his son Eliasib succeeded in the\r\nhigh priesthood. 6. Now there was one of those Jews that had been\r\ncarried captive who was cup-bearer to king Xerxes; his name was\r\nNehemiah. As this man was walking before Susa, the metropolis of the\r\nPersians, he heard some strangers that were entering the city, after a\r\nlong journey, speaking to one another in the Hebrew tongue; so he went\r\nto them, and asked them whence they came. And when their answer was,\r\nthat they came from Judea, he began to inquire of them again in what\r\nstate the multitude was, and in what condition Jerusalem was; and when\r\nthey replied that they were in a bad state 12 for that their walls were\r\nthrown down to the ground, and that the neighboring nations did a great\r\ndeal of mischief to the Jews, while in the day time they overran the\r\ncountry, and pillaged it, and in the night did them mischief, insomuch\r\nthat not a few were led away captive out of the country, and out of\r\nJerusalem itself, and that the roads were in the day time found full of\r\ndead men. Hereupon Nehemiah shed tears, out of commiseration of the\r\ncalamities of his countrymen; and, looking up to heaven, he said, \"How\r\nlong, O Lord, wilt thou overlook our nation, while it suffers so great\r\nmiseries, and while we are made the prey and spoil of all men?\" And\r\nwhile he staid at the gate, and lamented thus, one told him that the\r\nking was going to sit down to supper; so he made haste, and went as he\r\nwas, without wishing himself, to minister to the king in his office of\r\ncup-bearer. But as the king was very pleasant after supper, and more\r\ncheerful than usual, he cast his eyes on Nehemiah, and seeing him look\r\nsad, he asked him why he was sad. Whereupon he prayed to God to give him\r\nfavor, and afford him the power of persuading by his words, and said,\r\n\"How can I, O king, appear otherwise than thus, and not be in trouble,\r\nwhile I hear that the walls of Jerusalem, the city where are the\r\nsepulchers of my fathers, are thrown down to the ground, and that its\r\ngates are consumed by fire? But do thou grant me the favor to go and\r\nbuild its wall, and to finish the building of the temple.\" Accordingly,\r\nthe king gave him a signal that he freely granted him what he asked; and\r\ntold him that he should carry an epistle to the governors, that they\r\nmight pay him due honor, and afford him whatsoever assistance he wanted,\r\nand as he pleased. \"Leave off thy sorrow then,\" said the king, \"and be\r\ncheerful in the performance of thy office hereafter.\" So Nehemiah\r\nworshipped God, and gave the king thanks for his promise, and cleared up\r\nhis sad and cloudy countenance, by the pleasure he had from the king's\r\npromises. Accordingly, the king called for him the next day, and gave\r\nhim an epistle to be carried to Adeus, the governor of Syria, and\r\nPhoenicia, and Samaria; wherein he sent to him to pay due honor to\r\nNehemiah, and to supply him with what he wanted for his building.\r\n\r\n7. Now when he was come to Babylon, and had taken with him many of his\r\ncountrymen, who voluntarily followed him, he came to Jerusalem in the\r\ntwenty and fifth year of the reign of Xerxes. And when he had shown the\r\nepistles to God 13 he gave them to Adeus, and to the other governors. He\r\nalso called together all the people to Jerusalem, and stood in the midst\r\nof the temple, and made the following speech to them: \"You know, O Jews,\r\nthat God hath kept our fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in mind\r\ncontinually, and for the sake of their righteousness hath not left off\r\nthe care of you. Indeed he hath assisted me in gaining this authority of\r\nthe king to raise up our wall, and finish what is wanting of the temple.\r\nI desire you, therefore who well know the ill-will our neighboring\r\nnations bear to us, and that when once they are made sensible that we\r\nare in earnest about building, they will come upon us, and contrive many\r\nways of obstructing our works, that you will, in the first place, put\r\nyour trust in God, as in him that will assist us against their hatred,\r\nand to intermit building neither night nor day, but to use all\r\ndiligence, and to hasten on the work, now we have this especial\r\nopportunity for it.\" When he had said this, he gave order that the\r\nrulers should measure the wall, and part the work of it among the\r\npeople, according to their villages and cities, as every one's ability\r\nshould require. And when he had added this promise, that he himself,\r\nwith his servants, would assist them, he dissolved the assembly. So the\r\nJews prepared for the work: that is the name they are called by from the\r\nday that they came up from Babylon, which is taken from the tribe of\r\nJudah, which came first to these places, and thence both they and the\r\ncountry gained that appellation.\r\n\r\n8. But now when the Ammonites, and Moabites, and Samaritans, and all\r\nthat inhabited Celesyria, heard that the building went on apace, they\r\ntook it heinously, and proceeded to lay snares for them, and to hinder\r\ntheir intentions. They also slew many of the Jews, and sought how they\r\nmight destroy Nehemiah himself, by hiring some of the foreigners to kill\r\nhim. They also put the Jews in fear, and disturbed them, and spread\r\nabroad rumors, as if many nations were ready to make an expedition\r\nagainst them, by which means they were harassed, and had almost left off\r\nthe building. But none of these things could deter Nehemiah from being\r\ndiligent about the work; he only set a number of men about him as a\r\nguard to his body, and so unweariedly persevered therein, and was\r\ninsensible of any trouble, out of his desire to perfect this work. And\r\nthus did he attentively, and with great forecast, take care of his own\r\nsafety; not that he feared death, but of this persuasion, that if he\r\nwere dead, the walls for his citizens would never be raised. He also\r\ngave orders that the builders should keep their ranks, and have their\r\narmor on while they were building. Accordingly, the mason had his sword\r\non, as well as he that brought the materials for building. He also\r\nappointed that their shields should lie very near them; and he placed\r\ntrumpeters at every five hundred feet, and charged them, that if their\r\nenemies appeared, they should give notice of it to the people, that they\r\nmight fight in their armor, and their enemies might not fall upon them\r\nnaked. He also went about the compass of the city by night, being never\r\ndiscouraged, neither about the work itself, nor about his own diet and\r\nsleep, for he made no use of those things for his pleasure, but out of\r\nnecessity. And this trouble he underwent for two years and four months;\r\n14 for in so long a time was the wall built, in the twenty-eighth year\r\nof the reign of Xerxes, in the ninth month. Now when the walls were\r\nfinished, Nehemiah and the multitude offered sacrifices to God for the\r\nbuilding of them, and they continued in feasting eight days. However,\r\nwhen the nations which dwelt in Syria heard that the building of the\r\nwall was finished, they had indignation at it. But when Nehemiah saw\r\nthat the city was thin of people, he exhorted the priests and the\r\nLevites that they would leave the country, and remove themselves to the\r\ncity, and there continue; and he built them houses at his own expenses;\r\nand he commanded that part of the people which were employed in\r\ncultivating the land to bring the tithes of their fruits to Jerusalem,\r\nthat the priests and Levites having whereof they might live perpetually,\r\nmight not leave the Divine worship; who willingly hearkened to the\r\nconstitutions of Nehemiah, by which means the city Jerusalem came to be\r\nfuller of people than it was before. So when Nehemiah had done many\r\nother excellent things, and things worthy of commendation, in a glorious\r\nmanner, he came to a great age, and then died. He was a man of a good\r\nand righteous disposition, and very ambitious to make his own nation\r\nhappy; and he hath left the walls of Jerusalem as an eternal monument\r\nfor himself. Now this was done in the days of Xerxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. Concerning Esther And Mordecai And Haman; And How In The\r\nReign Of Artaxerxes The Whole Nation Of The Jews Was In Danger Of\r\nPerishing.\r\n\r\n1. After the death of Xerxes, the kingdom came to be transferred to his\r\nson Cyrus, whom the Greeks called Artaxerxes. When this man had obtained\r\nthe government over the Persians, the whole nation of the Jews, 15 with\r\ntheir wives and children, were in danger of perishing; the occasion\r\nwhereof we shall declare in a little time; for it is proper, in the\r\nfirst place, to explain somewhat relating to this king, and how he came\r\nto marry a Jewish wife, who was herself of the royal family also, and\r\nwho is related to have saved our nation; for when Artaxerxes had taken\r\nthe kingdom, and had set governors over the hundred twenty and seven\r\nprovinces, from India even unto Ethiopia, in the third year of his\r\nreign, he made a costly feast for his friends, and for the nations of\r\nPersia, and for their governors, such a one as was proper for a king to\r\nmake, when he had a mind to make a public demonstration of his riches,\r\nand this for a hundred and fourscore days; after which he made a feast\r\nfor other nations, and for their ambassadors, at Shushan, for seven\r\ndays. Now this feast was ordered after the manner following: He caused a\r\ntent to be pitched, which was supported by pillars of gold and silver,\r\nwith curtains of linen and purple spread over them, that it might afford\r\nroom for many ten thousands to sit down. The cups with which the waiters\r\nministered were of gold, and adorned with precious stones, for pleasure\r\nand for sight. He also gave order to the servants that they should not\r\nforce them to drink, by bringing them wine continually, as is the\r\npractice of the Persians, but to permit every one of the guests to enjoy\r\nhimself according to his own inclination. Moreover, he sent messengers\r\nthrough the country, and gave order that they should have a remission of\r\ntheir labors, and should keep a festival many days, on account of his\r\nkingdom. In like manner did Vashti the queen gather her guests together,\r\nand made them a feast in the palace. Now the king was desirous to show\r\nher, who exceeded all other women in beauty, to those that feasted with\r\nhim, and he sent some to command her to come to his feast. But she, out\r\nof regard to the laws of the Persians, which forbid the wives to be seen\r\nby strangers, did not go to the king 16 and though he oftentimes sent\r\nthe eunuchs to her, she did nevertheless stay away, and refused to come,\r\ntill the king was so much irritated, that he brake up the entertainment,\r\nand rose up, and called for those seven who had the interpretation of\r\nthe laws committed to them, and accused his wife, and said that he had\r\nbeen affronted by her, because that when she was frequently called by\r\nhim to his feast, she did not obey him once. He therefore gave order\r\nthat they should inform him what could be done by the law against her.\r\nSo one of them, whose name was Memucan, said that this affront was\r\noffered not to him alone, but to all the Persians, who were in danger of\r\nleading their lives very ill with their wives, if they must be thus\r\ndespised by them; for that none of their wives would have any reverence\r\nfor their husbands, if they, \"had such an example of arrogance in the\r\nqueen towards thee, who rulest over all.\" Accordingly, he exhorted him\r\nto punish her, who had been guilty of so great an affront to him, after\r\na severe manner; and when he had so done, to publish to the nations what\r\nhad been decreed about the queen. So the resolution was to put Vashti\r\naway, and to give her dignity to another woman.\r\n\r\n2. But the king having been fond of her, did not well bear a separation,\r\nand yet by the law he could not admit of a reconciliation; so he was\r\nunder trouble, as not having it in his power to do what he desired to\r\ndo. But when his friends saw him so uneasy, they advised him to cast the\r\nmemory of his wife, and his love for her, out of his mind, but to send\r\nabroad over all the habitable earth, and to search out for comely\r\nvirgins, and to take her whom he should best like for his wife, because\r\nhis passion for his former wife would be quenched by the introduction of\r\nanother, and the kindness he had for Vashti would be withdrawn from her,\r\nand be placed on her that was with him. Accordingly, he was persuaded to\r\nfollow this advice, and gave order to certain persons to choose out of\r\nthe virgins that were in his kingdom those that were esteemed the most\r\ncomely. So when a great number of these virgins were gathered together,\r\nthere was found a damsel in Babylon, whose parents were both dead, and\r\nshe was brought up with her uncle Mordecai, for that was her uncle's\r\nname. This uncle was of the tribe of Benjamin, and was one of the\r\nprincipal persons among the Jews. Now it proved that this damsel, whose\r\nname was Esther, was the most beautiful of all the rest, and that the\r\ngrace of her countenance drew the eyes of the spectators principally\r\nupon her. So she was committed to one of the eunuchs to take the care of\r\nher; and she was very exactly provided with sweet odors, in great\r\nplenty, and with costly ointments, such as her body required to be\r\nanointed withal; and this was used for six months by the virgins, who\r\nwere in number four hundred. And when the eunuch thought the virgins had\r\nbeen sufficiently purified, in the fore-mentioned time, and were now fit\r\nto go to the king's bed, he sent one to be with the king every day. So\r\nwhen he had accompanied with her, he sent her back to the eunuch; and\r\nwhen Esther had come to him, he was pleased with her, and fell in love\r\nwith the damsel, and married her, and made her his lawful wife, and kept\r\na wedding feast for her on the twelfth month of the seventh year of his\r\nreign, which was called Adar. He also sent angari, as they are called,\r\nor messengers, unto every nation, and gave orders that they should keep\r\na feast for his marriage, while he himself treated the Persians and the\r\nMedes, and the principal men of the nations, for a whole month, on\r\naccount of this his marriage. Accordingly, Esther came to his royal\r\npalace, and he set a diadem on her head. And thus was Esther married,\r\nwithout making known to the king what nation she was derived from. Her\r\nuncle also removed from Babylon to Shushan, and dwelt there, being every\r\nday about the palace, and inquiring how the damsel did, for he loved her\r\nas though she had been his own daughter.\r\n\r\n3. Now the king had made a law, 17 that none of his own people should\r\napproach him unless he were called, when he sat upon his throne and men,\r\nwith axes in their hands, stood round about his throne, in order to\r\npunish such as approached to him without being called. However, the king\r\nsat with a golden scepter in his hand, which he held out when he had a\r\nmind to save any one of those that approached to him without being\r\ncalled, and he who touched it was free from danger. But of this matter\r\nwe have discoursed sufficiently.\r\n\r\n4. Some time after this [two eunuchs], Bigthan and Teresh, plotted\r\nagainst the king; and Barnabazus, the servant of one of the eunuchs,\r\nbeing by birth a Jew, was acquainted with their conspiracy, and\r\ndiscovered it to the queen's uncle; and Mordecai, by the means of\r\nEsther, made the conspirators known to the king. This troubled the king;\r\nbut he discovered the truth, and hanged the eunuchs upon a cross, while\r\nat that time he gave no reward to Mordecai, who had been the occasion of\r\nhis preservation. He only bid the scribes to set down his name in the\r\nrecords, and bid him stay in the palace, as an intimate friend of the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n5. Now there was one Haman, the son of Amedatha, by birth an Amalekite,\r\nthat used to go in to the king; and the foreigners and Persians\r\nworshipped him, as Artaxerxes had commanded that such honor should be\r\npaid to him; but Mordecai was so wise, and so observant of his own\r\ncountry's laws, that he would not worship the man 18 When Haman observed\r\nthis, he inquired whence he came; and when he understood that he was a\r\nJew, he had indignation at him, and said within himself, that whereas\r\nthe Persians, who were free men, worshipped him, this man, who was no\r\nbetter than a slave, does not vouchsafe to do so. And when he desired to\r\npunish Mordecai, he thought it too small a thing to request of the king\r\nthat he alone might be punished; he rather determined to abolish the\r\nwhole nation, for he was naturally an enemy to the Jews, because the\r\nnation of the Amalekites, of which he was; had been destroyed by them.\r\nAccordingly he came to the king, and accused them, saying, \"There is a\r\ncertain wicked nation, and it is dispersed over all the habitable earth\r\nthat was under his dominion; a nation separate from others, unsociable,\r\nneither admitting the same sort of Divine worship that others do, nor\r\nusing laws like to the laws of others, at enmity with thy people, and\r\nwith all men, both in their manners and practices. Now, if thou wilt be\r\na benefactor to thy subjects, thou wilt give order to destroy them\r\nutterly, and not leave the least remains of them, nor preserve any of\r\nthem, either for slaves or for captives.\" But that the king might not be\r\ndamnified by the loss of the tributes which the Jews paid him, Haman\r\npromised to give him out of his own estate forty thousand talents\r\nwhensoever he pleased; and he said he would pay this money very\r\nwillingly, that the kingdom might be freed from such a misfortune.\r\n\r\n6. When Haman had made this petition, the king both forgave him the\r\nmoney, and granted him the men, to do what he would with them. So Haman,\r\nhaving gained what he desired, sent out immediately a decree, as from\r\nthe king, to all nations, the contents whereof were these: \"Artaxerxes,\r\nthe great king, to the rulers of the hundred twenty and seven provinces,\r\nfrom India to Ethiopia, sends this writing. Whereas I have governed many\r\nnations, and obtained the dominions of all the habitable earth,\r\naccording to my desire, and have not been obliged to do any thing that\r\nis insolent or cruel to my subjects by such my power, but have showed\r\nmyself mild and gentle, by taking care of their peace and good order,\r\nand have sought how they might enjoy those blessings for all time to\r\ncome. And whereas I have been kindly informed by Haman, who, on account\r\nof his prudence and justice, is the first in my esteem, and in dignity,\r\nand only second to myself, for his fidelity and constant good-will to\r\nme, that there is an ill-natured nation intermixed with all mankind,\r\nthat is averse to our laws, and not subject to kings, and of a different\r\nconduct of life from others, that hateth monarchy, and of a disposition\r\nthat is pernicious to our affairs, I give order that all these men, of\r\nwhom Haman our second father hath informed us, be destroyed, with their\r\nwives and children, and that none of them be spared, and that none\r\nprefer pity to them before obedience to this decree. And this I will to\r\nbe executed on the fourteenth day of the twelfth month of this present\r\nyear, that so when all that have enmity to us are destroyed, and this in\r\none day, we may be allowed to lead the rest of our lives in peace\r\nhereafter.\" Now when this decree was brought to the cities, and to the\r\ncountry, all were ready for the destruction and entire abolishment of\r\nthe Jews, against the day before mentioned; and they were very hasty\r\nabout it at Shushan, in particular. Accordingly, the king and Haman\r\nspent their time in feasting together with good cheer and wine, but the\r\ncity was in disorder.\r\n\r\n7. Now when Mordecai was informed of what was done, he rent his clothes,\r\nand put on sackcloth, and sprinkled ashes upon his head, and went about\r\nthe city, crying out, that \"a nation that had been injurious to no man\r\nwas to be destroyed.\" And he went on saying thus as far as to the king's\r\npalace, and there he stood, for it was not lawful for him to go into it\r\nin that habit. The same thing was done by all the Jews that were in the\r\nseveral cities wherein this decree was published, with lamentation and\r\nmourning, on account of the calamities denounced against them. But as\r\nsoon as certain persons had told the queen that Mordecai stood before\r\nthe court in a mourning habit, she was disturbed at this report, and\r\nsent out such as should change his garments; but when he could not be\r\ninduced to put off his sackcloth, because the sad occasion that forced\r\nhim to put it on was not yet ceased, she called the eunuch Acratheus,\r\nfor he was then present, and sent him to Mordecai, in order to know of\r\nhim what sad accident had befallen him, for which he was in mourning,\r\nand would not put off the habit he had put on at her desire. Then did\r\nMordecai inform the eunuch of the occasion of his mourning, and of the\r\ndecree which was sent by the king into all the country, and of the\r\npromise of money whereby Haman brought the destruction of their nation.\r\nHe also gave him a copy of what was proclaimed at Shushan, to be carried\r\nto Esther; and he charged her to petition the king about this matter,\r\nand not to think it a dishonorable thing in her to put on a humble\r\nhabit, for the safety of her nation, wherein she might deprecate the\r\nruin of the Jews, who were in danger of it; for that Haman, whose\r\ndignity was only inferior to that of the king, had accused the Jews, and\r\nhad irritated the king against them. When she was informed of this, she\r\nsent to Mordecai again, and told him that she was not called by the\r\nking, and that he who goes in to him without being called, is to be\r\nslain, unless when he is willing to save any one, he holds out his\r\ngolden scepter to him; but that to whomsoever he does so, although he go\r\nin without being called, that person is so far from being slain, that he\r\nobtains pardon, and is entirely preserved. Now when the eunuch carried\r\nthis message from Esther to Mordecai, he bade him also tell her that she\r\nmust not only provide for her own preservation, but for the common\r\npreservation of her nation, for that if she now neglected this\r\nopportunity, there would certainly arise help to them from God some\r\nother way, but she and her father's house would be destroyed by those\r\nwhom she now despised. But Esther sent the very same eunuch back to\r\nMordecai [to desire him] to go to Shushan, and to gather the Jews that\r\nwere there together to a congregation, and to fast and abstain from all\r\nsorts of food, on her account, and [to let him know that] she with her\r\nmaidens would do the same: and then she promised that she would go to\r\nthe king, though it were against the law, and that if she must die for\r\nit, she would not refuse it.\r\n\r\n8. Accordingly, Mordecai did as Esther had enjoined him, and made the\r\npeople fast; and he besought God, together with them, not to overlook\r\nhis nation, particularly at this time, when it was going to be\r\ndestroyed; but that, as he had often before provided for them, and\r\nforgiven, when they had sinned, so he would now deliver them from that\r\ndestruction which was denounced against them; for although it was not\r\nall the nation that had offended, yet must they so ingloriously be\r\nslain, and that he was himself the occasion of the wrath of Haman,\r\n\"Because,\" said he, \"I did not worship him, nor could I endure to pay\r\nthat honor to him which I used to pay to thee, O Lord; for upon that his\r\nanger hath he contrived this present mischief against those that have\r\nnot transgressed thy laws.\" The same supplications did the multitude put\r\nup, and entreated that God would provide for their deliverance, and free\r\nthe Israelites that were in all the earth from this calamity which was\r\nnow coming upon them, for they had it before their eyes, and expected\r\nits coming. Accordingly, Esther made supplication to God after the\r\nmanner of her country, by casting herself down upon the earth, and\r\nputting on her mourning garments, and bidding farewell to meat and\r\ndrink, and all delicacies, for three days' time; and she entreated God\r\nto have mercy upon her, and make her words appear persuasive to the\r\nking, and render her countenance more beautiful than it was before, that\r\nboth by her words and beauty she might succeed, for the averting of the\r\nking's anger, in case he were at all irritated against her, and for the\r\nconsolation of those of her own country, now they were in the utmost\r\ndanger of perishing; as also that he would excite a hatred in the king\r\nagainst the enemies of the Jews, and those that had contrived their\r\nfuture destruction, if they proved to be contemned by him.\r\n\r\n9. When Esther had used this supplication for three days, she put off\r\nthose garments, and changed her habit, and adorned herself as became a\r\nqueen, and took two of her handmaids with her, the one of which\r\nsupported her, as she gently leaned upon her, and the other followed\r\nafter, and lifted up her large train [which swept along the ground] with\r\nthe extremities of her fingers. And thus she came to the king, having a\r\nblushing redness in her countenance, with a pleasant agreeableness in\r\nher behavior; yet did she go in to him with fear; and as soon as she was\r\ncome over against him, as he was sitting on his throne, in his royal\r\napparel, which was a garment interwoven with gold and precious stones,\r\nwhich made him seem to her more terrible, especially when he looked at\r\nher somewhat severely, and with a countenance on fire with anger, her\r\njoints failed her immediately, out of the dread she was in, and she fell\r\ndown sideways in a swoon: but the king changed his mind, which happened,\r\nas I suppose, by the will of God, and was concerned for his wife, lest\r\nher fear should bring some very ill thing upon her, and he leaped from\r\nhis throne, and took her in his arms, and recovered her, by embracing\r\nher, and speaking comfortably to her, and exhorting her to be of good\r\ncheer, and not to suspect any thing that was sad on account of her\r\ncoming to him without being called, because that law was made for\r\nsubjects, but that she, who was a queen, as well as he a king, might be\r\nentirely secure; and as he said this, he put the scepter into her hand,\r\nand laid his rod upon her neck, on account of the law; and so freed her\r\nfrom her fear. And after she had recovered herself by these\r\nencouragements, she said, \"My lord, it is not easy for me, on the\r\nsudden, to say what hath happened, for as soon as I saw thee to be\r\ngreat, and comely, and terrible, my spirit departed from me, and I had\r\nno soul left in me.\" And while it was with difficulty, and in a low\r\nvoice, that she could say thus much, the king was in a great agony and\r\ndisorder, and encouraged Esther to be of good cheer, and to expect\r\nbetter fortune, since he was ready, if occasion should require it, to\r\ngrant her the half of his kingdom. Accordingly, Esther desired that he\r\nand his friend Haman would come to her to a banquet, for she said she\r\nhad prepared a supper for him. He consented to it; and when they were\r\nthere, as they were drinking, he bid Esther to let him know what she\r\ndesired; for that she should not be disappointed though she should\r\ndesire the half of his kingdom. But she put off the discovery of her\r\npetition till the next day, if he would come again, together with Haman,\r\nto her banquet.\r\n\r\n10. Now when the king had promised so to do, Haman went away very glad,\r\nbecause he alone had the honor of supping with the king at Esther's\r\nbanquet, and because no one else partook of the same honor with kings\r\nbut himself; yet when he saw Mordecai in the court, he was very much\r\ndispleased, for he paid him no manner of respect when he saw him. So he\r\nwent home and called for his wife Zeresh, and his friends, and when they\r\nwere come, he showed them what honor he enjoyed not only from the king,\r\nbut from the queen also, for as he alone had that day supped with her,\r\ntogether with the king, so was he also invited again for the next day;\r\n\"yet,\" said he, \"am I not pleased to see Mordecai the Jew in the court.\"\r\nHereupon his wife Zeresh advised him to give order that a gallows should\r\nbe made fifty cubits high, and that in the morning he should ask it of\r\nthe king that Mordecai might be hanged thereon. So he commended her\r\nadvice, and gave order to his servants to prepare the gallows, and to\r\nplace it in the court, for the punishment of Mordecai thereon, which was\r\naccordingly prepared. But God laughed to scorn the wicked expectations\r\nof Haman; and as he knew what the event would be, he was delighted at\r\nit, for that night he took away the king's sleep; and as the king was\r\nnot willing to lose the time of his lying awake, but to spend it in\r\nsomething that might be of advantage to his kingdom, he commanded the\r\nscribe to bring him the chronicles of the former kings, and the records\r\nof his own actions; and when he had brought them, and was reading them,\r\none was found to have received a country on account of his excellent\r\nmanagement on a certain occasion, and the name of the country was set\r\ndown; another was found to have had a present made him on account of his\r\nfidelity: then the scribe came to Bigthan and Teresh, the eunuchs that\r\nhad made a conspiracy against the king, which Mordecai had discovered;\r\nand when the scribe said no more but that, and was going on to another\r\nhistory, the king stopped him, and inquired \"whether it was not added\r\nthat Mordecai had a reward given him?\" and when he said there was no\r\nsuch addition, he bade him leave off; and he inquired of those that were\r\nappointed for that purpose, what hour of the night it was; and when he\r\nwas informed that it was already day, he gave order, that if they found\r\nany one of his friends already come, and standing before the court, they\r\nshould tell him. Now it happened that Haman was found there, for he was\r\ncome sooner than ordinary to petition the king to have Mordecai put to\r\ndeath; and when the servants said that Haman was before the court, he\r\nbid them call him in; and when he was come in, he said, \"Because I know\r\nthat thou art my only fast friend, I desire thee to give me advice how I\r\nmay honor one that I greatly love, and that after a manner suitable to\r\nmy magnificence.\" Now Haman reasoned with himself, that what opinion he\r\nshould give it would be for himself, since it was he alone who was\r\nbeloved by the king: so he gave that advice which he thought of all\r\nother the best; for he said, \"If thou wouldst truly honor a man whom\r\nthou sayest thou dost love, give order that he may ride on horseback,\r\nwith the same garment on which thou wearest, and with a gold chain about\r\nhis neck, and let one of thy intimate friends go before him, and\r\nproclaim through the whole city, that whosoever the king honoreth\r\nobtaineth this mark of his honor.\" This was the advice which Haman gave,\r\nout of a supposal that such a reward would come to himself. Hereupon the\r\nking was pleased with the advice, and said, \"Go thou therefore, for thou\r\nhast the horse, the garment, and the chain, ask for Mordecai the Jew,\r\nand give him those things, and go before his horse and proclaim\r\naccordingly; for thou art,\" said he, \"my intimate friend, and hast given\r\nme good advice; be thou then the minister of what thou hast advised me\r\nto. This shall be his reward from us, for preserving my life.\" When he\r\nheard this order, which was entirely unexpected, he was confounded in\r\nhis mind, and knew not what to do. However, he went out and led the\r\nhorse, and took the purple garment, and the golden chain for the neck,\r\nand finding Mordecai before the court, clothed in sackcloth, he bid him\r\nput that garment off, and put the purple garment on. But Mordecai, not\r\nknowing the truth of the matter, but thinking that it was done in\r\nmockery, said, \"O thou wretch, the vilest of all mankind, dost thou thus\r\nlaugh at our calamities?\" But when he was satisfied that the king\r\nbestowed this honor upon him, for the deliverance he had procured him\r\nwhen he convicted the eunuchs who had conspired against him, he put on\r\nthat purple garment which the king always wore, and put the chain about\r\nhis neck, and got on horseback, and went round the city, while Haman\r\nwent before and proclaimed, \"This shall be the reward which the king\r\nwill bestow on every one whom he loves, and esteems worthy of honor.\"\r\nAnd when they had gone round the city, Mordecai went in to the king; but\r\nHaman went home, out of shame, and informed his wife and friends of what\r\nhad happened, and this with tears; who said, that he would never be able\r\nto be revenged of Mordecai, for that God was with him.\r\n\r\n11. Now while these men were thus talking one to another, Esther's\r\neunuchs hastened Haman away to come to supper; but one of the eunuchs,\r\nnamed Sabuchadas, saw the gallows that was fixed in Haman's house, and\r\ninquired of one of his servants for what purpose they had prepared it.\r\nSo he knew that it was for the queen's uncle, because Haman was about to\r\npetition the king that he might be punished; but at present he held his\r\npeace. Now when the king, with Haman, were at the banquet, he desired\r\nthe queen to tell him what gifts she desired to obtain, and assured her\r\nthat she should have whatsoever she had a mind to. She then lamented the\r\ndanger her people were in; and said that \"she and her nation were given\r\nup to be destroyed, and that she, on that account, made this her\r\npetition; that she would not have troubled him if he had only given\r\norder that they should be sold into bitter servitude, for such a\r\nmisfortune would not have been intolerable; but she desired that they\r\nmight be delivered from such destruction.\" And when the king inquired of\r\nher whom was the author of this misery to them, she then openly accused\r\nHaman, and convicted him, that he had been the wicked instrument of\r\nthis, and had formed this plot against them. When the king was hereupon\r\nin disorder, and was gone hastily out of the banquet into the gardens,\r\nHaman began to intercede with Esther, and to beseech her to forgive him,\r\nas to what he had offended, for he perceived that he was in a very bad\r\ncase. And as he had fallen upon the queen's bed, and was making\r\nsupplication to her, the king came in, and being still more provoked at\r\nwhat he saw, \"O thou wretch,\" said he, \"thou vilest of mankind, dost\r\nthou aim to force in wife?\" And when Haman was astonished at this, and\r\nnot able to speak one word more, Sabuchadas the eunuch came in and\r\naccused Haman, and said, He found a gallows at his house, prepared for\r\nMordecai; for that the servant told him so much upon his inquiry, when\r\nhe was sent to him to call him to supper. He said further, that the\r\ngallows was fifty cubits high: which, when the king heard, he determined\r\nthat Haman should be punished after no other manner than that which had\r\nbeen devised by him against Mordecai; so he gave order immediately that\r\nhe should be hung upon those gallows, and be put to death after that\r\nmanner. And from hence I cannot forbear to admire God, and to learn\r\nhence his wisdom and his justice, not only in punishing the wickedness\r\nof Haman, but in so disposing it, that he should undergo the very same\r\npunishment which he had contrived for another; as also because thereby\r\nhe teaches others this lesson, that what mischiefs any one prepares\r\nagainst another, he, without knowing of it, first contrives it against\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n12. Wherefore Haman, who had immoderately abused the honor he had from\r\nthe king, was destroyed after this manner, and the king granted his\r\nestate to the queen. He also called for Mordecai, [for Esther had\r\ninformed him that she was akin to him,] and gave that ring to Mordecai\r\nwhich he had before given to Haman. The queen also gave Haman's estate\r\nto Mordecai; and prayed the king to deliver the nation of the Jews from\r\nthe fear of death, and showed him what had been written over all the\r\ncountry by Haman the son of Ammedatha; for that if her country were\r\ndestroyed, and her countrymen were to perish, she could not bear to live\r\nherself any longer. So the king promised her that he would not do any\r\nthing that should be disagreeable to her, nor contradict what she\r\ndesired; but he bid her write what she pleased about the Jews, in the\r\nking's name, and seal it with his seal, and send it to all his kingdom,\r\nfor that those who read epistles whose authority is secured by having\r\nthe king's seal to them, would no way contradict what was written\r\ntherein. So he commanded the king's scribes to be sent for, and to write\r\nto the nations, on the Jews' behalf, and to his lieutenants and\r\ngovernors, that were over his hundred twenty and seven provinces, from\r\nIndia to Ethiopia. Now the contents of this epistle were these: \"The\r\ngreat king Artaxerxes to our rulers, and those that are our faithful\r\nsubjects, sendeth greeting. 19 Many men there are who, on account of the\r\ngreatness of the benefits bestowed on them, and because of the honor\r\nwhich they have obtained from the wonderful kind treatment of those that\r\nbestowed it, are not only injurious to their inferiors, but do not\r\nscruple to do evil to those that have been their benefactors, as if they\r\nwould take away gratitude from among men, and by their insolent abuse of\r\nsuch benefits as they never expected, they turn the abundance they have\r\nagainst those that are the authors of it, and suppose they shall lie\r\nconcealed from God in that case, and avoid that vengeance which comes\r\nfrom him. Some of these men, when they have had the management of\r\naffairs committed to them by their friends, and bearing private malice\r\nof their own against some others, by deceiving those that have the\r\npower, persuade them to be angry at such as have done them no harm, till\r\nthey are in danger of perishing, and this by laying accusations and\r\ncalumnies: nor is this state of things to be discovered by ancient\r\nexamples, or such as we have learned by report only, but by some\r\nexamples of such impudent attempts under our own eyes; so that it is not\r\nfit to attend any longer to calumnies and accusations, nor to the\r\npersuasions of others, but to determine what any one knows of himself to\r\nhave been really done, and to punish what justly deserves it, and to\r\ngrant favors to such as are innocent. This hath been the case of Haman,\r\nthe son of Ammedatha, by birth an Amalekite, and alien from the blood of\r\nthe Persians, who, when he was hospitably entertained by us, and partook\r\nof that kindness which we bear to all men to so great a degree, as to be\r\ncalled my father, and to be all along worshipped, and to have honor paid\r\nhim by all in the second rank after the royal honor due to ourselves, he\r\ncould not bear his good fortune, nor govern the magnitude of his\r\nprosperity with sound reason; nay, he made a conspiracy against me and\r\nmy life, who gave him his authority, by endeavoring to take away\r\nMordecai, my benefactor, and my savior, and by basely and treacherously\r\nrequiring to have Esther, the partner of my life, and of my dominion,\r\nbrought to destruction; for he contrived by this means to deprive me of\r\nmy faithful friends, and transfer the government to others: 20 but since\r\nI perceived that these Jews, that were by this pernicious fellow devoted\r\nto destruction, were not wicked men, but conducted their lives after the\r\nbest manner, and were men dedicated to the worship of that God who hath\r\npreserved the kingdom to me and to my ancestors, I do not only free them\r\nfrom the punishment which the former epistle, which was sent by Haman,\r\nordered to be inflicted on them, to which if you refuse obedience, you\r\nshall do well; but I will that they have all honor paid to them.\r\nAccordingly, I have hanged up the man that contrived such things against\r\nthem, with his family, before the gates of Shushan; that punishment\r\nbeing sent upon him by God, who seeth all things. And I give you in\r\ncharge, that you publicly propose a copy of this epistle through all my\r\nkingdom, that the Jews may be permitted peaceably to use their own laws,\r\nand that you assist them, that at the same season whereto their\r\nmiserable estate did belong, they may defend themselves the very same\r\nday from unjust violence, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which\r\nis Adar; for God hath made that day a day of salvation instead of a day\r\nof destruction to them; and may it be a good day to those that wish us\r\nwell, and a memorial of the punishment of the conspirators against us:\r\nand I will that you take notice, that every city, and every nation, that\r\nshall disobey any thing that is contained in this epistle, shall be\r\ndestroyed by fire and sword. However, let this epistle be published\r\nthrough all the country that is under our obedience, and let all the\r\nJews, by all means, be ready against the day before mentioned, that they\r\nmay avenge themselves upon their enemies.\"\r\n\r\n13. Accordingly, the horsemen who carried the epistles proceeded on the\r\nways which they were to go with speed: but as for Mordecai, as soon as\r\nhe had assumed the royal garment, and the crown of gold, and had put the\r\nchain about his neck, he went forth in a public procession; and when the\r\nJews who were at Shushan saw him in so great honor with the king, they\r\nthought his good fortune was common to themselves also, and joy and a\r\nbeam of salvation encompassed the Jews, both those that were in the\r\ncities, and those that were in the countries, upon the publication of\r\nthe king's letters, insomuch that many even of other nations circumcised\r\ntheir foreskin for fear of the Jews, that they might procure safety to\r\nthemselves thereby; for on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month,\r\nwhich according to the Hebrews is called Adar, but according to the\r\nMacedonians, Dystrus, those that carried the king's epistle gave them\r\nnotice, that the same day wherein their danger was to have been, on that\r\nvery day should they destroy their enemies. But now the rulers of the\r\nprovinces, and the tyrants, and the kings, and the scribes, had the Jews\r\nin esteem; for the fear they were in of Mordecai forced them to act with\r\ndiscretion. Now when the royal decree was come to all the country that\r\nwas subject to the king, it fell out that the Jews at Shushan slew five\r\nhundred of their enemies; and when the king had told Esther the number\r\nof those that were slain in that city, but did not well know what had\r\nbeen done in the provinces, he asked her whether she would have any\r\nthing further done against them, for that it should be done accordingly:\r\nupon which she desired that the Jews might be permitted to treat their\r\nremaining enemies in the same manner the next day; as also that they\r\nmight hang the ten sons of Haman upon the gallows. So the king permitted\r\nthe Jews so to do, as desirous not to contradict Esther. So they\r\ngathered themselves together again on the fourteenth day of the month\r\nDystrus, and slew about three hundred of their enemies, but touched\r\nnothing of what riches they had. Now there were slain by the Jews that\r\nwere in the country, and in the other cities, seventy-five thousand of\r\ntheir enemies, and these were slain on the thirteenth day of the month,\r\nand the next day they kept as a festival. In like manner the Jews that\r\nwere in Shushan gathered themselves together, and feasted on the\r\nfourteenth day, and that which followed it; whence it is that even now\r\nall the Jews that are in the habitable earth keep these days festival,\r\nand send portions to one another. Mordecai also wrote to the Jews that\r\nlived in the kingdom of Artaxerxes to observe these days, and celebrate\r\nthem as festivals, and to deliver them down to posterity, that this\r\nfestival might continue for all time to come, and that it might never be\r\nburied in oblivion; for since they were about to be destroyed on these\r\ndays by Haman, they would do a right thing, upon escaping the danger in\r\nthem, and on them inflicting punishment on their enemies, to observe\r\nthose days, and give thanks to God on them; for which cause the Jews\r\nstill keep the forementioned days, and call them days of Phurim (or\r\nPurim.) 21 And Mordecai became a great and illustrious person with the\r\nking, and assisted him in the government of the people. He also lived\r\nwith the queen; so that the affairs of the Jews were, by their means,\r\nbetter than they could ever have hoped for. And this was the state of\r\nthe Jews under the reign of Artaxerxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How John Slew His Brother Jesus In The Temple; And How\r\nBagoses Offered Many Injuries To The Jews; And What Sanballat Did.\r\n\r\n1. When Eliashib the high priest was dead, his son Judas succeeded in\r\nthe high priesthood; and when he was dead, his son John took that\r\ndignity; on whose account it was also that Bagoses, the general of\r\nanother Artaxerxes's army, 22 polluted the temple, and imposed tributes\r\non the Jews, that out of the public stock, before they offered the daily\r\nsacrifices, they should pay for every lamb fifty shekels. Now Jesus was\r\nthe brother of John, and was a friend of Bagoses, who had promised to\r\nprocure him the high priesthood. In confidence of whose support, Jesus\r\nquarreled with John in the temple, and so provoked his brother, that in\r\nhis anger his brother slew him. Now it was a horrible thing for John,\r\nwhen he was high priest, to perpetrate so great a crime, and so much the\r\nmore horrible, that there never was so cruel and impious a thing done,\r\nneither by the Greeks nor Barbarians. However, God did not neglect its\r\npunishment, but the people were on that very account enslaved, and the\r\ntemple was polluted by the Persians. Now when Bagoses, the general of\r\nArtaxerxes's army, knew that John, the high priest of the Jews, had\r\nslain his own brother Jesus in the temple, he came upon the Jews\r\nimmediately, and began in anger to say to them, \"Have you had the\r\nimpudence to perpetrate a murder in your temple?\" And as he was aiming\r\nto go into the temple, they forbade him so to do; but he said to them,\r\n\"Am not I purer than he that was slain in the temple?\" And when he had\r\nsaid these words, he went into the temple. Accordingly, Bagoses made use\r\nof this pretense, and punished the Jews seven years for the murder of\r\nJesus.\r\n\r\n2. Now when John had departed this life, his son Jaddua succeeded in the\r\nhigh priesthood. He had a brother, whose name was Manasseh. Now there\r\nwas one Sanballat, who was sent by Darius, the last king [of Persia],\r\ninto Samaria. He was a Cutheam by birth; of which stock were the\r\nSamaritans also. This man knew that the city Jerusalem was a famous\r\ncity, and that their kings had given a great deal of trouble to the\r\nAssyrians, and the people of Celesyria; so that he willingly gave his\r\ndaughter, whose name was Nicaso, in marriage to Manasseh, as thinking\r\nthis alliance by marriage would be a pledge and security that the nation\r\nof the Jews should continue their good-will to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. Concerning Sanballat And Manasseh, And The Temple Which They\r\nBuilt On Mount Gerizzim; As Also How Alexander Made His Entry Into The\r\nCity Jerusalem, And What Benefits He Bestowed On The Jews.\r\n\r\n1. About this time it was that Philip, king of Macedon, was\r\ntreacherously assaulted and slain at Egae by Pausanias, the son of\r\nCerastes, who was derived from the family of Oreste, and his son\r\nAlexander succeeded him in the kingdom; who, passing over the\r\nHellespont, overcame the generals of Darius's army in a battle fought at\r\nGranicum. So he marched over Lydia, and subdued Ionia, and overran\r\nCaria, and fell upon the places of Pamphylia, as has been related\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n2. But the elders of Jerusalem being very uneasy that the brother of\r\nJaddua the high priest, though married to a foreigner, should be a\r\npartner with him in the high priesthood, quarreled with him; for they\r\nesteemed this man's marriage a step to such as should be desirous of\r\ntransgressing about the marriage of [strange] wives, and that this would\r\nbe the beginning of a mutual society with foreigners, although the\r\noffense of some about marriages, and their having married wives that\r\nwere not of their own country, had been an occasion of their former\r\ncaptivity, and of the miseries they then underwent; so they commanded\r\nManasseh to divorce his wife, or not to approach the altar, the high\r\npriest himself joining with the people in their indignation against his\r\nbrother, and driving him away from the altar. Whereupon Manasseh came to\r\nhis father-in-law, Sanballat, and told him, that although he loved his\r\ndaughter Nicaso, yet was he not willing to be deprived of his sacerdotal\r\ndignity on her account, which was the principal dignity in their nation,\r\nand always continued in the same family. And then Sanballat promised him\r\nnot only to preserve to him the honor of his priesthood, but to procure\r\nfor him the power and dignity of a high priest, and would make him\r\ngovernor of all the places he himself now ruled, if he would keep his\r\ndaughter for his wife. He also told him further, that he would build him\r\na temple like that at Jerusalem, upon Mount Gerizzini, which is the\r\nhighest of all the mountains that are in Samaria; and he promised that\r\nhe would do this with the approbation of Darius the king. Manasseh was\r\nelevated with these promises, and staid with Sanballat, upon a supposal\r\nthat he should gain a high priesthood, as bestowed on him by Darius, for\r\nit happened that Sanballat was then in years. But there was now a great\r\ndisturbance among the people of Jerusalem, because many of those priests\r\nand Levites were entangled in such matches; for they all revolted to\r\nManasseh, and Sanballat afforded them money, and divided among them land\r\nfor tillage, and habitations also, and all this in order every way to\r\ngratify his son-in-law.\r\n\r\n3. About this time it was that Darius heard how Alexander had passed\r\nover the Hellespont, and had beaten his lieutenants in the battle at\r\nGranicum, and was proceeding further; whereupon he gathered together an\r\narmy of horse and foot, and determined that he would meet the\r\nMacedonians before they should assault and conquer all Asia. So he\r\npassed over the river Euphrates, and came over Taurus, the Cilician\r\nmountain, and at Issus of Cilicia he waited for the enemy, as ready\r\nthere to give him battle. Upon which Sanballat was glad that Darius was\r\ncome down; and told Manasseh that he would suddenly perform his promises\r\nto him, and this as soon as ever Darius should come back, after he had\r\nbeaten his enemies; for not he only, but all those that were in Asia\r\nalso, were persuaded that the Macedonians would not so much as come to a\r\nbattle with the Persians, on account of their multitude. But the event\r\nproved otherwise than they expected; for the king joined battle with the\r\nMacedonians, and was beaten, and lost a great part of his army. His\r\nmother also, and his wife and children, were taken captives, and he fled\r\ninto Persia. So Alexander came into Syria, and took Damascus; and when\r\nhe had obtained Sidon, he besieged Tyre, when he sent an epistle to the\r\nJewish high priest, to send him some auxiliaries, and to supply his army\r\nwith provisions; and that what presents he formerly sent to Darius, he\r\nwould now send to him, and choose the friendship of the Macedonians, and\r\nthat he should never repent of so doing. But the high priest answered\r\nthe messengers, that he had given his oath to Darius not to bear arms\r\nagainst him; and he said that he would not transgress this while Darius\r\nwas in the land of the living. Upon hearing this answer, Alexander was\r\nvery angry; and though he determined not to leave Tyre, which was just\r\nready to be taken, yet as soon as he had taken it, he threatened that he\r\nwould make an expedition against the Jewish high priest, and through him\r\nteach all men to whom they must keep their oaths. So when he had, with a\r\ngood deal of pains during the siege, taken Tyre, and had settled its\r\naffairs, he came to the city of Gaza, and besieged both the city and him\r\nthat was governor of the garrison, whose name was Babemeses.\r\n\r\n4. But Sanballat thought he had now gotten a proper opportunity to make\r\nhis attempt, so he renounced Darius, and taking with him seven thousand\r\nof his own subjects, he came to Alexander; and finding him beginning the\r\nsiege of Tyre, he said to him, that he delivered up to him these men,\r\nwho came out of places under his dominion, and did gladly accept of him\r\nfor his lord instead of Darius. So when Alexander had received him\r\nkindly, Sanballat thereupon took courage, and spake to him about his\r\npresent affair. He told him that he had a son-in-law, Manasseh, who was\r\nbrother to the high priest Jaddua; and that there were many others of\r\nhis own nation, now with him, that were desirous to have a temple in the\r\nplaces subject to him; that it would be for the king's advantage to have\r\nthe strength of the Jews divided into two parts, lest when the nation is\r\nof one mind, and united, upon any attempt for innovation, it prove\r\ntroublesome to kings, as it had formerly proved to the kings of Assyria.\r\nWhereupon Alexander gave Sanballat leave so to do, who used the utmost\r\ndiligence, and built the temple, and made Manasseh the priest, and\r\ndeemed it a great reward that his daughter's children should have that\r\ndignity; but when the seven months of the siege of Tyre were over, and\r\nthe two months of the siege of Gaza, Sanballat died. Now Alexander, when\r\nhe had taken Gaza, made haste to go up to Jerusalem; and Jaddua the high\r\npriest, when he heard that, was in an agony, and under terror, as not\r\nknowing how he should meet the Macedonians, since the king was\r\ndispleased at his foregoing disobedience. He therefore ordained that the\r\npeople should make supplications, and should join with him in offering\r\nsacrifice to God, whom he besought to protect that nation, and to\r\ndeliver them from the perils that were coming upon them; whereupon God\r\nwarned him in a dream, which came upon him after he had offered\r\nsacrifice, that he should take courage, and adorn the city, and open the\r\ngates; that the rest should appear in white garments, but that he and\r\nthe priests should meet the king in the habits proper to their order,\r\nwithout the dread of any ill consequences, which the providence of God\r\nwould prevent. Upon which, when he rose from his sleep, he greatly\r\nrejoiced, and declared to all the warning he had received from God.\r\nAccording to which dream he acted entirely, and so waited for the coming\r\nof the king.\r\n\r\n5. And when he understood that he was not far from the city, he went out\r\nin procession, with the priests and the multitude of the citizens. The\r\nprocession was venerable, and the manner of it different from that of\r\nother nations. It reached to a place called Sapha, which name,\r\ntranslated into Greek, signifies a prospect, for you have thence a\r\nprospect both of Jerusalem and of the temple. And when the Phoenicians\r\nand the Chaldeans that followed him thought they should have liberty to\r\nplunder the city, and torment the high priest to death, which the king's\r\ndispleasure fairly promised them, the very reverse of it happened; for\r\nAlexander, when he saw the multitude at a distance, in white garments,\r\nwhile the priests stood clothed with fine linen, and the high priest in\r\npurple and scarlet clothing, with his mitre on his head, having the\r\ngolden plate whereon the name of God was engraved, he approached by\r\nhimself, and adored that name, and first saluted the high priest. The\r\nJews also did all together, with one voice, salute Alexander, and\r\nencompass him about; whereupon the kings of Syria and the rest were\r\nsurprised at what Alexander had done, and supposed him disordered in his\r\nmind. However, Parmenio alone went up to him, and asked him how it came\r\nto pass that, when all others adored him, he should adore the high\r\npriest of the Jews? To whom he replied, \"I did not adore him, but that\r\nGod who hath honored him with his high priesthood; for I saw this very\r\nperson in a dream, in this very habit, when I was at Dios in Macedonia,\r\nwho, when I was considering with myself how I might obtain the dominion\r\nof Asia, exhorted me to make no delay, but boldly to pass over the sea\r\nthither, for that he would conduct my army, and would give me the\r\ndominion over the Persians; whence it is that, having seen no other in\r\nthat habit, and now seeing this person in it, and remembering that\r\nvision, and the exhortation which I had in my dream, I believe that I\r\nbring this army under the Divine conduct, and shall therewith conquer\r\nDarius, and destroy the power of the Persians, and that all things will\r\nsucceed according to what is in my own mind.\" And when he had said this\r\nto Parmenio, and had given the high priest his right hand, the priests\r\nran along by him, and he came into the city. And when he went up into\r\nthe temple, he offered sacrifice to God, according to the high priest's\r\ndirection, and magnificently treated both the high priest and the\r\npriests. And when the Book of Daniel was showed him 23 wherein Daniel\r\ndeclared that one of the Greeks should destroy the empire of the\r\nPersians, he supposed that himself was the person intended. And as he\r\nwas then glad, he dismissed the multitude for the present; but the next\r\nday he called them to him, and bid them ask what favors they pleased of\r\nhim; whereupon the high priest desired that they might enjoy the laws of\r\ntheir forefathers, and might pay no tribute on the seventh year. He\r\ngranted all they desired. And when they entreated him that he would\r\npermit the Jews in Babylon and Media to enjoy their own laws also, he\r\nwillingly promised to do hereafter what they desired. And when he said\r\nto the multitude, that if any of them would enlist themselves in his\r\narmy, on this condition, that they should continue under the laws of\r\ntheir forefathers, and live according to them, he was willing to take\r\nthem with him, many were ready to accompany him in his wars.\r\n\r\n6. So when Alexander had thus settled matters at Jerusalem, he led his\r\narmy into the neighboring cities; and when all the inhabitants to whom\r\nhe came received him with great kindness, the Samaritans, who had then\r\nShechem for their metropolis, [a city situate at Mount Gerizzim, and\r\ninhabited by apostates of the Jewish nation,] seeing that Alexander had\r\nso greatly honored the Jews, determined to profess themselves Jews; for\r\nsuch is the disposition of the Samaritans, as we have already elsewhere\r\ndeclared, that when the Jews are in adversity, they deny that they are\r\nof kin to them, and then they confess the truth; but when they perceive\r\nthat some good fortune hath befallen them, they immediately pretend to\r\nhave communion with them, saying that they belong to them, and derive\r\ntheir genealogy from the posterity of Joseph, Ephraim, and Manasseh.\r\nAccordingly, they made their address to the king with splendor, and\r\nshowed great alacrity in meeting him at a little distance from\r\nJerusalem. And when Alexander had commended them, the Shechemites\r\napproached to him, taking with them the troops that Sanballat had sent\r\nhim, and they desired that he would come to their city, and do honor to\r\ntheir temple also; to whom he promised, that when he returned he would\r\ncome to them. And when they petitioned that he would remit the tribute\r\nof the seventh year to them, because they did but sow thereon, he asked\r\nwho they were that made such a petition; and when they said that they\r\nwere Hebrews, but had the name of Sidonians, living at Shechem, he asked\r\nthem again whether they were Jews; and when they said they were not\r\nJews, \"It was to the Jews,\" said he, \"that I granted that privilege;\r\nhowever, when I return, and am thoroughly informed by you of this\r\nmatter, I will do what I shall think proper.\" And in this manner he took\r\nleave of the Shechemites; but ordered that the troops of Sanballat\r\nshould follow him into Egypt, because there he designed to give them\r\nlands, which he did a little after in Thebais, when he ordered them to\r\nguard that country.\r\n\r\n7. Now when Alexander was dead, the government was parted among his\r\nsuccessors, but the temple upon Mount Gerizzim remained. And if any one\r\nwere accused by those of Jerusalem of having eaten things common or of\r\nhaving broken the sabbath, or of any other crime of the like nature, he\r\nfled away to the Shechemites, and said that he was accused unjustly.\r\nAbout this time it was that Jaddua the high priest died, and Onias his\r\nson took the high priesthood. This was the state of the affairs of the\r\npeople of Jerusalem at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ This Cyrus is called God's shepherd by Xenophon, as well as\r\nby Isaiah, Isaiah 44:28; as also it is said of him by the same prophet,\r\nthat \"I will make a man more precious than fine gold, even a man than\r\nthe golden wedge of Ophir,\" Isaiah 13:12, which character makes\r\nXenophon's most excellent history of him very credible.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ This leave to build Jerusalem, sect. 3, and this epistle of\r\nCyrus to Sisinnes and Sathrabuzanes, to the same purpose, are most\r\nunfortunately omitted in all our copies but this best and completest\r\ncopy of Josephus; and by such omission the famous prophecy of Isaiah,\r\nIsaiah 44:28, where we are informed that God said of or to Cyrus, \"He is\r\nmy shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure; even saying to\r\nJerusalem, Thou shalt be built, and to the temple, Thy foundation shall\r\nbe laid,\" could not hitherto be demonstrated from the sacred history to\r\nhave been completely fulfilled, I mean as to that part of it which\r\nconcerned his giving leave or commission for rebuilding the city\r\nJerusalem as distinct from the temple, whose rebuilding is alone\r\npermitted or directed in the decree of Cyrus in all our copies.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ Of the true number of golden and silver vessels here and\r\nelsewhere belonging to the temple of Solomon, see the description of the\r\ntemples, chap. 13.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ Josephus here follows Herodotus, and those that related how\r\nCyrus made war with the Scythians and Massagets, near the Caspian Sea,\r\nand perished in it; while Xenophon's account, which appears never to\r\nhave been seen by Josephus, that Cyrus died in peace in his own country\r\nof Persia, is attested to by the writers of the affairs of Alexander the\r\nGreat, when they agree that he found Cyrus's sepulcher at Pasargadae,\r\nnear Persepolis. This account of Xenophon is also confirmed by the\r\ncircumstances of Cambyses, upon his succession to Cyrus, who, instead of\r\na war to avenge his father's death upon the Scythians and Massagets, and\r\nto prevent those nations from overrunning his northern provinces, which\r\nwould have been the natural consequence of his father's ill success and\r\ndeath there, went immediately to an Egyptian war, long ago begun by\r\nCyrus, according to Xenophon, p. 644, and conquered that kingdom; nor is\r\nthere, that I ever heard of, the least mention in the reign of Cambyses\r\nof any war against the Scythians and Massagets that he was ever engaged\r\nin all his life.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 (return) [ The reader is to note, that although the speeches or papers\r\nof these three of the king's guard are much the same, in our Third Book\r\nof Esdras, ch. 3. and 4., as they are here in Josephus, yet that the\r\nintroduction of them is entirely different, while in our Esdras the\r\nwhole is related as the contrivance of the three of the king's guards\r\nthemselves; and even the mighty rewards are spoken of as proposed by\r\nthemselves, and the speeches are related to have been delivered by\r\nthemselves to the king in writing, while all is contrary in Josephus. I\r\nneed not say whose account is the most probable, the matters speak for\r\nthemselves; and there can be no doubt but Josephus's history is here to\r\nbe very much preferred before the other. Nor indeed does it seem to me\r\nat all unlikely that the whole was a contrivance of king Darius's own,\r\nin order to be decently and inoffensively put in mind by Zorobabel of\r\nfulfilling his old vow for the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple,\r\nand the restoration of the worship of the \"one true God\" there. Nor does\r\nthe full meaning of Zorobabel, when he cries out, 3 Esd. 4. 41],\r\n\"Blessed be the God of truth;\" and here, \"God is true and righteous;\" or\r\neven of all the people, 3 Esd. 4. 41, \"Great is truth, and mighty above\r\nall things;\" seem to me much different from this, \"There is but one true\r\nGod, the God of Israel.\" To which doctrine, such as Cyrus and Darius;\r\netc., the Jews' great patrons, seem not to have been very averse, though\r\nthe entire idolatry of their kingdoms made them generally conceal it.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 (return) [ This strange reading in Josephus's present copies of four\r\nmillions instead of forty thousand, is one of the grossest errors that\r\nis in them, and ought to be corrected from Ezra 2:61; 1 Esd. 5:40; and\r\nNehemiah 7:66, who all agree the general sum was but about forty-two\r\nthousand three hundred and sixty. It is also very plain that Josephus\r\nthought, that when Esdras afterwards brought up another company out of\r\nBabylon and Persia, in the days of Xerxes, they were also, as well as\r\nthese, out of the two tribes, and out of them only, and were in all no\r\nmore than \"a seed\" and \"a remnant,\" while an \"immense number\" of the ten\r\ntribes never returned, but, as he believed, continued then beyond\r\nEuphrates, ch. 5. sect. 2, 3; of which multitude, the Jews beyond\r\nEuphrates, he speaks frequently elsewhere, though, by the way, he never\r\ntakes them to be idolaters, but looks on them still as observers of the\r\nlaws of Moses. The \"certain part\" of the people that now came up from\r\nBabylon, at the end of this chapter, imply the same smaller number of\r\nJews that now came up, and will no way agree with the four millions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 (return) [ The history contained in this section is entirely wanting\r\nin all our other copies, both of Ezra and Esdras.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8 (return) [ Dr. Hudson takes notice here, that this kind of brass or\r\ncopper, or rather mixture of gold and brass or copper, was called\r\naurichalcum, and that this was of old esteemed the most precious of all\r\nmetals.]\r\n\r\n\r\n9 (return) [ This procedure of Esdras, and of the best part of the\r\nJewish nation, after their return from the Babylonish captivity, of\r\nreducing the Jewish marriages, once for all, to the strictness of the\r\nlaw of Moses, without any regard to the greatness of those who had\r\nbroken it, and without regard to that natural affection or compassion\r\nfor their heathen wives, and their children by them, which made it so\r\nhard for Esdras to correct it, deserves greatly to be observed and\r\nimitated in all attempts for reformation among Christians, the contrary\r\nconduct having ever been the bane of true religion, both among Jews and\r\nChristians, while political views, or human passions, or prudential\r\nmotives, are suffered to take place instead of the Divine laws, and so\r\nthe blessing of God is forfeited, and the church still suffered to\r\ncontinue corrupt from one generation to another.

It may also be remarked further, that\r\nJosephus hardly ever mentions more than one infallible astronomical\r\ncharacter, I mean an eclipse of the moon, and this a little before the\r\ndeath of Herod the Great, Antiq.

Now on these\r\ntwo chronological characters in great measure depend some of the most\r\nimportant points belonging to Christianity, viz. the explication of\r\nDaniel's seventy weeks, and the duration of our Savior's ministry, and\r\nthe time of his death, in correspondence to those seventy weeks. See the\r\nSupplement to the Lit. Accorap. of Proph. p. 72.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15 (return) [ Since some skeptical persons are willing to discard this\r\nBook of Esther as no true history; and even our learned and judicious\r\nDr. Wall, in his late posthumous Critical Notes upon all the other\r\nHebrew books of the Old Testament, gives none upon the Canticles, or\r\nupon Esther, and seems thereby to give up this book, as well as he gives\r\nup the Canticles, as indefensible; I shall venture to say, that almost\r\nall the objections against this Book of Esther are gone at once, if, as\r\nwe certainly ought to do, and as Dean Prideaux has justly done, we place\r\nthis history under Artsxerxes Longimanus, as do both the Septuagint\r\ninterpretation and Josephus. The learned Dr. Lee, in his posthumous\r\nDissertation on the Second Book of Esdras, p. 25, also says, that \"the\r\ntruth of this history is demonstrated by the feast of Purlin, kept up\r\nfrom that time to this very day. And this surprising providential\r\nrevolution in favor of a captive people, thereby constantly\r\ncommemorated, standeth even upon a firmer basis than that there ever was\r\nsuch a man as king Alexander [the Great] in the world, of whose reign\r\nthere is no such abiding monument at this day to be found any where. Nor\r\nwill they, I dare say, who quarrel at this or any other of the sacred\r\nhistories, find it a very easy matter to reconcile the different\r\naccounts which were given by historians of the affairs of this king, or\r\nto confirm any one fact of his whatever with the same evidence which is\r\nhere given for the principal fact in this sacred book, or even so much\r\nas to prove the existence of such a person, of whom so great things are\r\nrelated, but upon granting this Book of Esther, or sixth of Esdras, [as\r\nit is placed in some of the most ancient copies of the Vulgate,] to be a\r\nmost true and certain history,\" etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 (return) [ If the Chaldee paraphrast be in the right, that Artaxerxes\r\nintended to show Vashti to his guests naked, it is no wonder at all that\r\nshe would not submit to such an indignity; but still if it were not so\r\ngross as that, yet it might, in the king's cups, be done in a way so\r\nindecent, as the Persian laws would not then bear, no more than the\r\ncommon laws of modesty. And that the king had some such design seems not\r\nimprobable, for otherwise the principal of these royal guests could be\r\nno strangers to the queen, nor unapprized of her beauty, so far as\r\ndecency admitted. However, since Providence was now paving the way for\r\nthe introduction of a Jewess into the king's affections, in order to\r\nbring about one of the most wonderful deliverances which the Jewish or\r\nany other nation ever had, we need not be further solicitous about the\r\nmotives by which the king was induced to divorce Vashti, and marry\r\nEsther.]\r\n\r\n\r\n17 (return) [ Herodotus says that this law [against any one's coming\r\nuncalled to the kings of Persia when they were sitting on their thrones]\r\nwas first enacted by Deioces [i.e. by him who first withdrew the Medes\r\nfrom the dominion of the Assyrians, and himself first reigned over\r\nthem].

As to this whole Book of Esther in the present Hebrew copy, it\r\nis so very imperfect, in a case where the providence of God was so very\r\nremarkable, and the Septuagint and Josephus have so much of religion,\r\nthat it has not so much as the name of God once in it; and it is hard to\r\nsay who made that epitome which the Masorites have given us for the\r\ngenuine book itself; no religious Jews could well be the authors of it,\r\nwhose education obliged them to have a constant regard to God, and\r\nwhatsoever related to his worship; nor do we know that there ever was so\r\nimperfect a copy of it in the world till after the days of Barchochab,\r\nin the second century.]\r\n\r\n\r\n22 (return) [ Concerning this other Artaxerxes, called Muemon, and the\r\nPersian affliction and captivity of the Jews under him, occasioned by\r\nthe murder of the high priest's brother in the holy house itself, see\r\nAuthent.

Containing The Interval Of A Hundred And Seventy Years.—From\r\nThe Death Of Alexander The Great To The Death Of Judas Maccabeus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. How Ptolemy The Son Of Lagus Took Jerusalem And Judea By\r\nDeceit And Treachery, And Carried Many Thence, And Planted Them In\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Alexander, king of Macedon, had put an end to the dominion\r\nof the Persians, and had settled the affairs in Judea after the\r\nforementioned manner, he ended his life. And as his government fell\r\namong many, Antigonus obtained Asia, Seleucus Babylon; and of the other\r\nnations which were there, Lysimachus governed the Hellespont, and\r\nCassander possessed Macedonia; as did Ptolemy the son of Lagus seize\r\nupon Egypt. And while these princes ambitiously strove one against\r\nanother, every one for his own principality, it came to pass that there\r\nwere continual wars, and those lasting wars too; and the cities were\r\nsufferers, and lost a great many of their inhabitants in these times of\r\ndistress, insomuch that all Syria, by the means of Ptolemy the son of\r\nLagus, underwent the reverse of that denomination of Savior, which he\r\nthen had. He also seized upon Jerusalem, and for that end made use of\r\ndeceit and treachery; for as he came into the city on a sabbath day, as\r\nif he would offer sacrifices 1 he, without any trouble, gained the city,\r\nwhile the Jews did not oppose him, for they did not suspect him to be\r\ntheir enemy; and he gained it thus, because they were free from\r\nsuspicion of him, and because on that day they were at rest and\r\nquietness; and when he had gained it, he ruled over it in a cruel\r\nmanner. Nay, Agatharchides of Cnidus, who wrote the acts of Alexander's\r\nsuccessors, reproaches us with superstition, as if we, by it, had lost\r\nour liberty; where he says thus: \"There is a nation called the nation of\r\nthe Jews, who inhabit a city strong and great, named Jerusalem. These\r\nmen took no care, but let it come into the hands of Ptolemy, as not\r\nwilling to take arms, and thereby they submitted to be under a hard\r\nmaster, by reason of their unseasonable superstition.\" This is what\r\nAgatharchides relates of our nation. But when Ptolemy had taken a great\r\nmany captives, both from the mountainous parts of Judea, and from the\r\nplaces about Jerusalem and Samaria, and the places near Mount Gerizzim,\r\nhe led them all into Egypt, 2 and settled them there. And as he knew\r\nthat the people of Jerusalem were most faithful in the observation of\r\noaths and covenants; and this from the answer they made to Alexander,\r\nwhen he sent an embassage to them, after he had beaten Darius in battle;\r\nso he distributed many of them into garrisons, and at Alexandria gave\r\nthem equal privileges of citizens with the Macedonians themselves; and\r\nrequired of them to take their oaths, that they would keep their\r\nfidelity to the posterity of those who committed these places to their\r\ncare. Nay, there were not a few other Jews who, of their own accord,\r\nwent into Egypt, as invited by the goodness of the soil, and by the\r\nliberality of Ptolemy. However, there were disorders among their\r\nposterity, with relation to the Samaritans, on account of their\r\nresolution to preserve that conduct of life which was delivered to them\r\nby their forefathers, and they thereupon contended one with another,\r\nwhile those of Jerusalem said that their temple was holy, and resolved\r\nto send their sacrifices thither; but the Samaritans were resolved that\r\nthey should be sent to Mount Gerizzim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How Ptolemy Philadelphus Procured The Laws Of The Jews To Be\r\nTranslated Into The Greek Tongue And Set Many Captives Free, And\r\nDedicated Many Gifts To God.\r\n\r\n1. When Alexander had reigned twelve years, and after him Ptolemy Soter\r\nforty years, Philadelphus then took the kingdom of Egypt, and held it\r\nforty years within one. He procured the law to be interpreted, and set\r\nfree those that were come from Jerusalem into Egypt, and were in slavery\r\nthere, who were a hundred and twenty thousand. The occasion was this:\r\nDemetrius Phalerius, who was library keeper to the king, was now\r\nendeavoring, if it were possible, to gather together all the books that\r\nwere in the habitable earth, and buying whatsoever was any where\r\nvaluable, or agreeable to the king's inclination, [who was very\r\nearnestly set upon collecting of books,] to which inclination of his\r\nDemetrius was zealously subservient. And when once Ptolemy asked him how\r\nmany ten thousands of books he had collected, he replied, that he had\r\nalready about twenty times ten thousand; but that, in a little time, he\r\nshould have fifty times ten thousand. But he said he had been informed\r\nthat there were many books of laws among the Jews worthy of inquiring\r\nafter, and worthy of the king's library, but which, being written in\r\ncharacters and in a dialect of their own, will cause no small pains in\r\ngetting them translated into the Greek tongue; 3 that the character in\r\nwhich they are written seems to be like to that which is the proper\r\ncharacter of the Syrians, and that its sound, when pronounced, is like\r\ntheirs also; and that this sound appears to be peculiar to themselves.\r\nWherefore he said that nothing hindered why they might not get those\r\nbooks to be translated also; for while nothing is wanting that is\r\nnecessary for that purpose, we may have their books also in this\r\nlibrary. So the king thought that Demetrius was very zealous to procure\r\nhim abundance of books, and that he suggested what was exceeding proper\r\nfor him to do; and therefore he wrote to the Jewish high priest, that he\r\nshould act accordingly.\r\n\r\n2. Now there was one Aristeus, who was among the king's most intimate\r\nfriends, and on account of his modesty very acceptable to him. This\r\nAristeus resolved frequently, and that before now, to petition the king\r\nthat he would set all the captive Jews in his kingdom free; and he\r\nthought this to be a convenient opportunity for the making that\r\npetition. So he discoursed, in the first place, with the captains of the\r\nking's guards, Sosibius of Tarentum, and Andreas, and persuaded them to\r\nassist him in what he was going to intercede with the king for.\r\nAccordingly Aristeus embraced the same opinion with those that have been\r\nbefore mentioned, and went to the king, and made the following speech to\r\nhim: \"It is not fit for us, O king, to overlook things hastily, or to\r\ndeceive ourselves, but to lay the truth open. For since we have\r\ndetermined not only to get the laws of the Jews transcribed, but\r\ninterpreted also, for thy satisfaction, by what means can we do this,\r\nwhile so many of the Jews are now slaves in thy kingdom? Do thou then\r\nwhat will be agreeable to thy magnanimity, and to thy good nature: free\r\nthem from the miserable condition they are in, because that God, who\r\nsupporteth thy kingdom, was the author of their laws as I have learned\r\nby particular inquiry; for both these people, and we also, worship the\r\nsame God the framer of all things. We call him, and that truly, by the\r\nname of GREEK, [or life, or Jupiter,] because he breathes life into all\r\nmen. Wherefore do thou restore these men to their own country, and this\r\ndo to the honor of God, because these men pay a peculiarly excellent\r\nworship to him. And know this further, that though I be not of kin to\r\nthem by birth, nor one of the same country with them, yet do I desire\r\nthese favors to be done them, since all men are the workmanship of God;\r\nand I am sensible that he is well-pleased with those that do good. I do\r\ntherefore put up this petition to thee, to do good to them.\"\r\n\r\n3. When Aristeus was saying thus, the king looked upon him with a\r\ncheerful and joyful countenance, and said, \"How many ten thousands dost\r\nthou suppose there are of such as want to be made free?\" To which\r\nAndreas replied, as he stood by, and said, \"A few more than ten times\r\nten thousand.\" The king made answer, \"And is this a small gift that thou\r\naskest, Aristeus?\" But Sosibius, and the rest that stood by, said that\r\nhe ought to offer such a thank-offering as was worthy of his greatness\r\nof soul, to that God who had given him his kingdom. With this answer he\r\nwas much pleased; and gave order, that when they paid the soldiers their\r\nwages, they should lay down [a hundred and] twenty drachmas 4 for every\r\none of the slaves? And he promised to publish a magnificent decree,\r\nabout what they requested, which should confirm what Aristeus had\r\nproposed, and especially what God willed should be done; whereby he said\r\nhe would not only set those free who had been led away captive by his\r\nfather and his army, but those who were in this kingdom before, and\r\nthose also, if any such there were, who had been brought away since. And\r\nwhen they said that their redemption money would amount to above four\r\nhundred talents, he granted it. A copy of which decree I have determined\r\nto preserve, that the magnanimity of this king may be made known. Its\r\ncontents were as follows: \"Let all those who were soldiers under our\r\nfather, and who, when they overran Syria and Phoenicia, and laid waste\r\nJudea, took the Jews captives, and made them slaves, and brought them\r\ninto our cities, and into this country, and then sold them; as also all\r\nthose that were in my kingdom before them, and if there be any that have\r\nbeen lately brought thither,—be made free by those that possess them;\r\nand let them accept of [a hundred and] twenty drachmas for every slave.\r\nAnd let the soldiers receive this redemption money with their pay, but\r\nthe rest out of the king's treasury: for I suppose that they were made\r\ncaptives without our father's consent, and against equity; and that\r\ntheir country was harassed by the insolence of the soldiers, and that,\r\nby removing them into Egypt, the soldiers have made a great profit by\r\nthem. Out of regard therefore to justice, and out of pity to those that\r\nhave been tyrannized over, contrary to equity, I enjoin those that have\r\nsuch Jews in their service to set them at liberty, upon the receipt of\r\nthe before-mentioned sum; and that no one use any deceit about them, but\r\nobey what is here commanded. And I will that they give in their names\r\nwithin three days after the publication of this edict, to such as are\r\nappointed to execute the same, and to produce the slaves before them\r\nalso, for I think it will be for the advantage of my affairs. And let\r\nevery one that will inform against those that do not obey this decree,\r\nand I will that their estates be confiscated into the king's treasury.\"\r\nWhen this decree was read to the king, it at first contained the rest\r\nthat is here inserted, and omitted only those Jews that had formerly\r\nbeen brought, and those brought afterwards, which had not been\r\ndistinctly mentioned; so he added these clauses out of his humanity, and\r\nwith great generosity. He also gave order that the payment, which was\r\nlikely to be done in a hurry, should be divided among the king's\r\nministers, and among the officers of his treasury. When this was over,\r\nwhat the king had decreed was quickly brought to a conclusion; and this\r\nin no more than seven days' time, the number of the talents paid for the\r\ncaptives being above four hundred and sixty, and this, because their\r\nmasters required the [hundred and] twenty drachmas for the children\r\nalso, the king having, in effect, commanded that these should be paid\r\nfor, when he said in his decree, that they should receive the\r\nforementioned sum for every slave.\r\n\r\n4. Now when this had been done after so magnificent a manner, according\r\nto the king's inclinations, he gave order to Demetrius to give him in\r\nwriting his sentiments concerning the transcribing of the Jewish books;\r\nfor no part of the administration is done rashly by these kings, but all\r\nthings are managed with great circumspection. On which account I have\r\nsubjoined a copy of these epistles, and set down the multitude of the\r\nvessels sent as gifts [to Jerusalem], and the construction of every one,\r\nthat the exactness of the artificers' workmanship, as it appeared to\r\nthose that saw them, and which workman made every vessel, may be made\r\nmanifest, and this on account of the excellency of the vessels\r\nthemselves. Now the copy of the epistle was to this purpose: \"Demetrius\r\nto the great king. When thou, O king, gavest me a charge concerning the\r\ncollection of books that were wanting to fill your library, and\r\nconcerning the care that ought to be taken about such as are imperfect,\r\nI have used the utmost diligence about those matters. And I let you\r\nknow, that we want the books of the Jewish legislation, with some\r\nothers; for they are written in the Hebrew characters, and being in the\r\nlanguage of that nation, are to us unknown. It hath also happened to\r\nthem, that they have been transcribed more carelessly than they ought to\r\nhave been, because they have not had hitherto royal care taken about\r\nthem. Now it is necessary that thou shouldst have accurate copies of\r\nthem. And indeed this legislation is full of hidden wisdom, and entirely\r\nblameless, as being the legislation of God; for which cause it is, as\r\nHecateus of Abdera says, that the poets and historians make no mention\r\nof it, nor of those men who lead their lives according to it, since it\r\nis a holy law, and ought not to be published by profane mouths. If then\r\nit please thee, O king, thou mayst write to the high priest of the Jews,\r\nto send six of the elders out of every tribe, and those such as are most\r\nskillful of the laws, that by their means we may learn the clear and\r\nagreeing sense of these books, and may obtain an accurate interpretation\r\nof their contents, and so may have such a collection of these as may be\r\nsuitable to thy desire.\"\r\n\r\n5. When this epistle was sent to the king, he commanded that an epistle\r\nshould be drawn up for Eleazar, the Jewish high priest, concerning these\r\nmatters; and that they should inform him of the release of the Jews that\r\nhad been in slavery among them. He also sent fifty talents of gold for\r\nthe making of large basons, and vials, and cups, and an immense quantity\r\nof precious stones. He also gave order to those who had the custody of\r\nthe chest that contained those stones, to give the artificers leave to\r\nchoose out what sorts of them they pleased. He withal appointed, that a\r\nhundred talents in money should be sent to the temple for sacrifices,\r\nand for other uses. Now I will give a description of these vessels, and\r\nthe manner of their construction, but not till after I have set down a\r\ncopy of the epistle which was written to Eleazar the high priest, who\r\nhad obtained that dignity on the occasion following: When Onias the high\r\npriest was dead, his son Simon became his successor. He was called Simon\r\nthe Just 5 because of both his piety towards God, and his kind\r\ndisposition to those of his own nation. When he was dead, and had left a\r\nyoung son, who was called Onias, Simon's brother Eleazar, of whom we are\r\nspeaking, took the high priesthood; and he it was to whom Ptolemy wrote,\r\nand that in the manner following: \"King Ptolemy to Eleazar the high\r\npriest, sendeth greeting. There are many Jews who now dwell in my\r\nkingdom, whom the Persians, when they were in power, carried captives.\r\nThese were honored by my father; some of them he placed in the army, and\r\ngave them greater pay than ordinary; to others of them, when they came\r\nwith him into Egypt, he committed his garrisons, and the guarding of\r\nthem, that they might be a terror to the Egyptians. And when I had taken\r\nthe government, I treated all men with humanity, and especially those\r\nthat are thy fellow citizens, of whom I have set free above a hundred\r\nthousand that were slaves, and paid the price of their redemption to\r\ntheir masters out of my own revenues; and those that are of a fit age, I\r\nhave admitted into them number of my soldiers. And for such as are\r\ncapable of being faithful to me, and proper for my court, I have put\r\nthem in such a post, as thinking this [kindness done to them] to be a\r\nvery great and an acceptable gift, which I devote to God for his\r\nprovidence over me. And as I am desirous to do what will be grateful to\r\nthese, and to all the other Jews in the habitable earth, I have\r\ndetermined to procure an interpretation of your law, and to have it\r\ntranslated out of Hebrew into Greek, and to be deposited in my library.\r\nThou wilt therefore do well to choose out and send to me men of a good\r\ncharacter, who are now elders in age, and six in number out of every\r\ntribe. These, by their age, must be skillful in the laws, and of\r\nabilities to make an accurate interpretation of them; and when this\r\nshall be finished, I shall think that I have done a work glorious to\r\nmyself. And I have sent to thee Andreas, the captain of my guard, and\r\nAristeus, men whom I have in very great esteem; by whom I have sent\r\nthose first-fruits which I have dedicated to the temple, and to the\r\nsacrifices, and to other uses, to the value of a hundred talents. And if\r\nthou wilt send to us, to let us know what thou wouldst have further,\r\nthou wilt do a thing acceptable to me.\"\r\n\r\n6. When this epistle of the king was brought to Eleazar, he wrote an\r\nanswer to it with all the respect possible: \"Eleazar the high priest to\r\nking Ptolemy, sendeth greeting. If thou and thy queen Arsinoe, 6 and thy\r\nchildren, be well, we are entirely satisfied. When we received thy\r\nepistle, we greatly rejoiced at thy intentions; and when the multitude\r\nwere gathered together, we read it to them, and thereby made them\r\nsensible of the piety thou hast towards God. We also showed them the\r\ntwenty vials of gold, and thirty of silver, and the five large basons,\r\nand the table for the shew-bread; as also the hundred talents for the\r\nsacrifices, and for the making what shall be needful at the temple;\r\nwhich things Andreas and Aristeus, those most honored friends of thine,\r\nhave brought us; and truly they are persons of an excellent character,\r\nand of great learning, and worthy of thy virtue. Know then that we will\r\ngratify thee in what is for thy advantage, though we do what we used not\r\nto do before; for we ought to make a return for the numerous acts of\r\nkindness which thou hast done to our countrymen. We immediately,\r\ntherefore, offered sacrifices for thee and thy sister, with thy children\r\nand friends; and the multitude made prayers, that thy affairs may be to\r\nthy mind, and that thy kingdom may be preserved in peace, and that the\r\ntranslation of our law may come to the conclusion thou desirest, and be\r\nfor thy advantage. We have also chosen six elders out of every tribe,\r\nwhom we have sent, and the law with them. It will be thy part, out of\r\nthy piety and justice, to send back the law, when it hath been\r\ntranslated, and to return those to us that bring it in safety.\r\nFarewell.\"\r\n\r\n7. This was the reply which the high priest made. But it does not seem\r\nto me to be necessary to set down the names of the seventy [two] elders\r\nwho were sent by Eleazar, and carried the law, which yet were subjoined\r\nat the end of the epistle. However, I thought it not improper to give an\r\naccount of those very valuable and artificially contrived vessels which\r\nthe king sent to God, that all may see how great a regard the king had\r\nfor God; for the king allowed a vast deal of expenses for these vessels,\r\nand came often to the workmen, and viewed their works, and suffered\r\nnothing of carelessness or negligence to be any damage to their\r\noperations. And I will relate how rich they were as well as I am able,\r\nalthough perhaps the nature of this history may not require such a\r\ndescription; but I imagine I shall thereby recommend the elegant taste\r\nand magnanimity of this king to those that read this history.\r\n\r\n8. And first I will describe what belongs to the table. It was indeed in\r\nthe king's mind to make this table vastly large in its dimensions; but\r\nthen he gave orders that they should learn what was the magnitude of the\r\ntable which was already at Jerusalem, and how large it was, and whether\r\nthere was a possibility of making one larger than it. And when he was\r\ninformed how large that was which was already there, and that nothing\r\nhindered but a larger might be made, he said that he was willing to have\r\none made that should be five times as large as the present table; but\r\nhis fear was, that it might be then useless in their sacred\r\nministrations by its too great largeness; for he desired that the gifts\r\nhe presented them should not only be there for show, but should be\r\nuseful also in their sacred ministrations. According to which reasoning,\r\nthat the former table was made of so moderate a size for use, and not\r\nfor want of gold, he resolved that he would not exceed the former table\r\nin largeness; but would make it exceed it in the variety and elegancy of\r\nits materials. And as he was sagacious in observing the nature of all\r\nthings, and in having a just notion of what was new and surprising, and\r\nwhere there was no sculptures, he would invent such as were proper by\r\nhis own skill, and would show them to the workmen, he commanded that\r\nsuch sculptures should now be made, and that those which were delineated\r\nshould be most accurately formed by a constant regard to their\r\ndelineation.\r\n\r\n9. When therefore the workmen had undertaken to make the table, they\r\nframed it in length two cubits [and a half], in breadth one cubit, and\r\nin height one cubit and a half; and the entire structure of the work was\r\nof gold. They withal made a crown of a hand-breadth round it, with wave-\r\nwork wreathed about it, and with an engraving which imitated a cord, and\r\nwas admirably turned on its three parts; for as they were of a\r\ntriangular figure, every angle had the same disposition of its\r\nsculptures, that when you turned them about, the very same form of them\r\nwas turned about without any variation. Now that part of the crown-work\r\nthat was enclosed under the table had its sculptures very beautiful; but\r\nthat part which went round on the outside was more elaborately adorned\r\nwith most beautiful ornaments, because it was exposed to sight, and to\r\nthe view of the spectators; for which reason it was that both those\r\nsides which were extant above the rest were acute, and none of the\r\nangles, which we before told you were three, appeared less than another,\r\nwhen the table was turned about. Now into the cordwork thus turned were\r\nprecious stones inserted, in rows parallel one to the other, enclosed in\r\ngolden buttons, which had ouches in them; but the parts which were on\r\nthe side of the crown, and were exposed to the sight, were adorned with\r\na row of oval figures obliquely placed, of the most excellent sort of\r\nprecious stones, which imitated rods laid close, and encompassed the\r\ntable round about. But under these oval figures, thus engraven, the\r\nworkmen had put a crown all round it, where the nature of all sorts of\r\nfruit was represented, insomuch that the bunches of grapes hung up. And\r\nwhen they had made the stones to represent all the kinds of fruit before\r\nmentioned, and that each in its proper color, they made them fast with\r\ngold round the whole table. The like disposition of the oval figures,\r\nand of the engraved rods, was framed under the crown, that the table\r\nmight on each side show the same appearance of variety and elegancy of\r\nits ornaments; so that neither the position of the wave-work nor of the\r\ncrown might be different, although the table were turned on the other\r\nside, but that the prospect of the same artificial contrivances might be\r\nextended as far as the feet; for there was made a plate of gold four\r\nfingers broad, through the entire breadth of the table, into which they\r\ninserted the feet, and then fastened them to the table by buttons and\r\nbutton-holes, at the place where the crown was situate, that so on what\r\nside soever of the table one should stand, it might exhibit the very\r\nsame view of the exquisite workmanship, and of the vast expenses\r\nbestowed upon it: but upon the table itself they engraved a meander,\r\ninserting into it very valuable stones in the middle like stars, of\r\nvarious colors; the carbuncle and the emerald, each of which sent out\r\nagreeable rays of light to the spectators; with such stones of other\r\nsorts also as were most curious and best esteemed, as being most\r\nprecious in their kind. Hard by this meander a texture of net-work ran\r\nround it, the middle of which appeared like a rhombus, into which were\r\ninserted rock-crystal and amber, which, by the great resemblance of the\r\nappearance they made, gave wonderful delight to those that saw them. The\r\nchapiters of the feet imitated the first buddings of lilies, while their\r\nleaves were bent and laid under the table, but so that the chives were\r\nseen standing upright within them. Their bases were made of a carbuncle;\r\nand the place at the bottom, which rested on that carbuncle, was one\r\npalm deep, and eight fingers in breadth. Now they had engraven upon it\r\nwith a very fine tool, and with a great deal of pains, a branch of ivy\r\nand tendrils of the vine, sending forth clusters of grapes, that you\r\nwould guess they were nowise different from real tendrils; for they were\r\nso very thin, and so very far extended at their extremities, that they\r\nwere moved with the wind, and made one believe that they were the\r\nproduct of nature, and not the representation of art. They also made the\r\nentire workmanship of the table appear to be threefold, while the joints\r\nof the several parts were so united together as to be invisible, and the\r\nplaces where they joined could not be distinguished. Now the thickness\r\nof the table was not less than half a cubit. So that this gift, by the\r\nking's great generosity, by the great value of the materials, and the\r\nvariety of its exquisite structure, and the artificer's skill in\r\nimitating nature with graying tools, was at length brought to\r\nperfection, while the king was very desirous, that though in largeness\r\nit were not to be different from that which was already dedicated to\r\nGod, yet that in exquisite workmanship, and the novelty of the\r\ncontrivances, and in the splendor of its construction, it should far\r\nexceed it, and be more illustrious than that was.\r\n\r\n10. Now of the cisterns of gold there were two, whose sculpture was of\r\nscale-work, from its basis to its belt-like circle, with various sorts\r\nof stones enchased in the spiral circles. Next to which there was upon\r\nit a meander of a cubit in height; it was composed of stones of all\r\nsorts of colors. And next to this was the rod-work engraven; and next to\r\nthat was a rhombus in a texture of net-work, drawn out to the brim of\r\nthe basin, while small shields, made of stones, beautiful in their kind,\r\nand of four fingers' depth, filled up the middle parts. About the top of\r\nthe basin were wreathed the leaves of lilies, and of the convolvulus,\r\nand the tendrils of vines in a circular manner. And this was the\r\nconstruction of the two cisterns of gold, each containing two firkins.\r\nBut those which were of silver were much more bright and splendid than\r\nlooking-glasses, and you might in them see the images that fell upon\r\nthem more plainly than in the other. The king also ordered thirty vials;\r\nthose of which the parts that were of gold, and filled up with precious\r\nstones, were shadowed over with the leaves of ivy and of vines,\r\nartificially engraven. And these were the vessels that were after an\r\nextraordinary manner brought to this perfection, partly by the skill of\r\nthe workmen, who were admirable in such fine work, but much more by the\r\ndiligence and generosity of the king, who not only supplied the\r\nartificers abundantly, and with great generosity, with what they wanted,\r\nbut he forbade public audiences for the time, and came and stood by the\r\nworkmen, and saw the whole operation. And this was the cause why the\r\nworkmen were so accurate in their performance, because they had regard\r\nto the king, and to his great concern about the vessels, and so the more\r\nindefatigably kept close to the work.\r\n\r\n11. And these were what gifts were sent by Ptolemy to Jerusalem, and\r\ndedicated to God there. But when Eleazar the high priest had devoted\r\nthem to God, and had paid due respect to those that brought them, and\r\nhad given them presents to be carried to the king, he dismissed them.\r\nAnd when they were come to Alexandria, and Ptolemy heard that they were\r\ncome, and that the seventy elders were come also, he presently sent for\r\nAndreas and Aristens, his ambassadors, who came to him, and delivered\r\nhim the epistle which they brought him from the high priest, and made\r\nanswer to all the questions he put to them by word of mouth. He then\r\nmade haste to meet the elders that came from Jerusalem for the\r\ninterpretation of the laws; and he gave command, that every body who\r\ncame on other occasions should be sent away, which was a thing\r\nsurprising, and what he did not use to do; for those that were drawn\r\nthither upon such occasions used to come to him on the fifth day, but\r\nambassadors at the month's end. But when he had sent those away, he\r\nwaited for these that were sent by Eleazar; but as the old men came in\r\nwith the presents, which the high priest had given them to bring to the\r\nking, and with the membranes, upon which they had their laws written in\r\ngolden letters 7 he put questions to them concerning those books; and\r\nwhen they had taken off the covers wherein they were wrapt up, they\r\nshowed him the membranes. So the king stood admiring the thinness of\r\nthose membranes, and the exactness of the junctures, which could not be\r\nperceived; [so exactly were they connected one with another;] and this\r\nhe did for a considerable time. He then said that he returned them\r\nthanks for coming to him, and still greater thanks to him that sent\r\nthem; and, above all, to that God whose laws they appeared to be. Then\r\ndid the elders, and those that were present with them, cry out with one\r\nvoice, and wished all happiness to the king. Upon which he fell into\r\ntears by the violence of the pleasure he had, it being natural to men to\r\nafford the same indications in great joy that they do under sorrows. And\r\nwhen he had bid them deliver the books to those that were appointed to\r\nreceive them, he saluted the men, and said that it was but just to\r\ndiscourse, in the first place, of the errand they were sent about, and\r\nthen to address himself to themselves. He promised, however, that he\r\nwould make this day on which they came to him remarkable and eminent\r\nevery year through the whole course of his life; for their coming to\r\nhim, and the victory which he gained over Antigonus by sea, proved to be\r\non the very same day. He also gave orders that they should sup with him;\r\nand gave it in charge that they should have excellent lodgings provided\r\nfor them in the upper part of the city.\r\n\r\n12. Now he that was appointed to take care of the reception of\r\nstrangers, Nicanor by name, called for Dorotheus, whose duty it was to\r\nmake provision for them, and bid him prepare for every one of them what\r\nshould be requisite for their diet and way of living; which thing was\r\nordered by the king after this manner: he took care that those that\r\nbelonged to every city, which did not use the same way of living, that\r\nall things should be prepared for them according to the custom of those\r\nthat came to him, that, being feasted according to the usual method of\r\ntheir own way of living, they might be the better pleased, and might not\r\nbe uneasy at any thing done to them from which they were naturally\r\naverse. And this was now done in the case of these men by Dorotheus, who\r\nwas put into this office because of his great skill in such matters\r\nbelonging to common life; for he took care of all such matters as\r\nconcerned the reception of strangers, and appointed them double seats\r\nfor them to sit on, according as the king had commanded him to do; for\r\nhe had commanded that half of their seats should be set at his right\r\nhand, and the other half behind his table, and took care that no respect\r\nshould be omitted that could be shown them. And when they were thus set\r\ndown, he bid Dorotheus to minister to all those that were come to him\r\nfrom Judea, after the manner they used to be ministered to; for which\r\ncause he sent away their sacred heralds, and those that slew the\r\nsacrifices, and the rest that used to say grace; but called to one of\r\nthose that were come to him, whose name was Eleazar, who was a priest,\r\nand desired him to say grace; 8 who then stood in the midst of them, and\r\nprayed, that all prosperity might attend the king, and those that were\r\nhis subjects. Upon which an acclamation was made by the whole company,\r\nwith joy and a great noise; and when that was over, they fell to eating\r\ntheir supper, and to the enjoyment of what was set before them. And at a\r\nlittle interval afterward, when the king thought a sufficient time had\r\nbeen interposed, he began to talk philosophically to them, and he asked\r\nevery one of them a philosophical question 9 and such a one as might\r\ngive light in those inquiries; and when they had explained all the\r\nproblems that had been proposed by the king about every point, he was\r\nwell-pleased with their answers. This took up the twelve days in which\r\nthey were treated; and he that pleases may learn the particular\r\nquestions in that book of Aristeus, which he wrote on this very\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n13. And while not the king only, but the philosopher Menedemus also,\r\nadmired them, and said that all things were governed by Providence, and\r\nthat it was probable that thence it was that such force or beauty was\r\ndiscovered in these men's words, they then left off asking any more such\r\nquestions. But the king said that he had gained very great advantages by\r\ntheir coming, for that he had received this profit from them, that he\r\nhad learned how he ought to rule his subjects. And he gave order that\r\nthey should have every one three talents given them, and that those that\r\nwere to conduct them to their lodging should do it. Accordingly, when\r\nthree days were over, Demetrius took them, and went over the causeway\r\nseven furlongs long: it was a bank in the sea to an island. And when\r\nthey had gone over the bridge, he proceeded to the northern parts, and\r\nshowed them where they should meet, which was in a house that was built\r\nnear the shore, and was a quiet place, and fit for their discoursing\r\ntogether about their work. When he had brought them thither, he\r\nentreated them [now they had all things about them which they wanted for\r\nthe interpretation of their law] that they would suffer nothing to\r\ninterrupt them in their work. Accordingly, they made an accurate\r\ninterpretation, with great zeal and great pains, and this they continued\r\nto do till the ninth hour of the day; after which time they relaxed, and\r\ntook care of their body, while their food was provided for them in great\r\nplenty: besides, Dorotheus, at the king's command, brought them a great\r\ndeal of what was provided for the king himself. But in the morning they\r\ncame to the court and saluted Ptolemy, and then went away to their\r\nformer place, where, when they had washed their hands, 10 and purified\r\nthemselves, they betook themselves to the interpretation of the laws.\r\nNow when the law was transcribed, and the labor of interpretation was\r\nover, which came to its conclusion in seventy-two days, Demetrius\r\ngathered all the Jews together to the place where the laws were\r\ntranslated, and where the interpreters were, and read them over. The\r\nmultitude did also approve of those elders that were the interpreters of\r\nthe law. They withal commended Demetrius for his proposal, as the\r\ninventor of what was greatly for their happiness; and they desired that\r\nhe would give leave to their rulers also to read the law. Moreover, they\r\nall, both the priest and the ancientest of the elders, and the principal\r\nmen of their commonwealth, made it their request, that since the\r\ninterpretation was happily finished, it might continue in the state it\r\nnow was, and might not be altered. And when they all commended that\r\ndetermination of theirs, they enjoined, that if any one observed either\r\nany thing superfluous, or any thing omitted, that he would take a view\r\nof it again, and have it laid before them, and corrected; which was a\r\nwise action of theirs, that when the thing was judged to have been well\r\ndone, it might continue for ever.\r\n\r\n14. So the king rejoiced when he saw that his design of this nature was\r\nbrought to perfection, to so great advantage; and he was chiefly\r\ndelighted with hearing the Laws read to him; and was astonished at the\r\ndeep meaning and wisdom of the legislator. And he began to discourse\r\nwith Demetrius, \"How it came to pass, that when this legislation was so\r\nwonderful, no one, either of the poets or of the historians, had made\r\nmention of it.\" Demetrius made answer, \"that no one durst be so bold as\r\nto touch upon the description of these laws, because they were Divine\r\nand venerable, and because some that had attempted it were afflicted by\r\nGod.\" He also told him, that \"Theopompus was desirous of writing\r\nsomewhat about them, but was thereupon disturbed in his mind for above\r\nthirty days' time; and upon some intermission of his distemper, he\r\nappeased God [by prayer], as suspecting that his madness proceeded from\r\nthat cause.\" Nay, indeed, he further saw in a dream, that his distemper\r\nbefell him while he indulged too great a curiosity about Divine matters,\r\nand was desirous of publishing them among common men; but when he left\r\noff that attempt, he recovered his understanding again. Moreover, he\r\ninformed him of Theodectes, the tragic poet, concerning whom it was\r\nreported, that when in a certain dramatic representation he was desirous\r\nto make mention of things that were contained in the sacred books, he\r\nwas afflicted with a darkness in his eyes; and that upon his being\r\nconscious of the occasion of his distemper, and appeasing God [by\r\nprayer], he was freed from that affliction.\r\n\r\n15. And when the king had received these books from Demetrius, as we\r\nhave said already, he adored them, and gave order that great care should\r\nbe taken of them, that they might remain uncorrupted. He also desired\r\nthat the interpreters would come often to him out of Judea, and that\r\nboth on account of the respects that he would pay them, and on account\r\nof the presents he would make them; for he said it was now but just to\r\nsend them away, although if, of their own accord, they would come to him\r\nhereafter, they should obtain all that their own wisdom might justly\r\nrequire, and what his generosity was able to give them. So he then sent\r\nthem away, and gave to every one of them three garments of the best\r\nsort, and two talents of gold, and a cup of the value of one talent, and\r\nthe furniture of the room wherein they were feasted. And these were the\r\nthings he presented to them. But by them he sent to Eleazar the high\r\npriest ten beds, with feet of silver, and the furniture to them\r\nbelonging, and a cup of the value of thirty talents; and besides these,\r\nten garments, and purple, and a very beautiful crown, and a hundred\r\npieces of the finest woven linen; as also vials and dishes, and vessels\r\nfor pouring, and two golden cisterns to be dedicated to God. He also\r\ndesired him, by an epistle, that he would give these interpreters leave,\r\nif any of them were desirous of coming to him, because he highly valued\r\na conversation with men of such learning, and should be very willing to\r\nlay out his wealth upon such men. And this was what came to the Jews,\r\nand was much to their glory and honor, from Ptolemy Philadelphus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How The Kings Of Asia Honored The Nation Of The Jews And Made\r\nThem Citizens Of Those Cities Which They Built.\r\n\r\n1. The Jews also obtained honors from the kings of Asia when they became\r\ntheir auxiliaries; for Seleucus Nicator made them citizens in those\r\ncities which he built in Asia, and in the lower Syria, and in the\r\nmetropolis itself, Antioch; and gave them privileges equal to those of\r\nthe Macedonians and Greeks, who were the inhabitants, insomuch that\r\nthese privileges continue to this very day: an argument for which you\r\nhave in this, that whereas the Jews do not make use of oil prepared by\r\nforeigners, 11 they receive a certain sum of money from the proper\r\nofficers belonging to their exercises as the value of that oil; which\r\nmoney, when the people of Antioch would have deprived them of, in the\r\nlast war, Mucianus, who was then president of Syria, preserved it to\r\nthem. And when the people of Alexandria and of Antioch did after that,\r\nat the time that Vespasian and Titus his son governed the habitable\r\nearth, pray that these privileges of citizens might be taken away, they\r\ndid not obtain their request in which behavior any one may discern the\r\nequity and generosity of the Romans, 12 especially of Vespasian and\r\nTitus, who, although they had been at a great deal of pains in the war\r\nagainst the Jews, and were exasperated against them, because they did\r\nnot deliver up their weapons to them, but continued the war to the very\r\nlast, yet did not they take away any of their forementioned privileges\r\nbelonging to them as citizens, but restrained their anger, and overcame\r\nthe prayers of the Alexandrians and Antiochians, who were a very\r\npowerful people, insomuch that they did not yield to them, neither out\r\nof their favor to these people, nor out of their old grudge at those\r\nwhose wicked opposition they had subdued in the war; nor would they\r\nalter any of the ancient favors granted to the Jews, but said, that\r\nthose who had borne arms against them, and fought them, had suffered\r\npunishment already, and that it was not just to deprive those that had\r\nnot offended of the privileges they enjoyed.\r\n\r\n2. We also know that Marcus Agrippa was of the like disposition towards\r\nthe Jews: for when the people of Ionia were very angry at them, and\r\nbesought Agrippa that they, and they only, might have those privileges\r\nof citizens which Antiochus, the grandson of Seleucus, [who by the\r\nGreeks was called The God,] had bestowed on them, and desired that, if\r\nthe Jews were to be joint-partakers with them, they might be obliged to\r\nworship the gods they themselves worshipped: but when these matters were\r\nbrought to the trial, the Jews prevailed, and obtained leave to make use\r\nof their own customs, and this under the patronage of Nicolaus of\r\nDamascus; for Agrippa gave sentence that he could not innovate. And if\r\nany one hath a mind to know this matter accurately, let him peruse the\r\nhundred and twenty-third and hundred and twenty-fourth books of the\r\nhistory of this Nicolaus. Now as to this determination of Agrippa, it is\r\nnot so much to be admired, for at that time our nation had not made war\r\nagainst the Romans. But one may well be astonished at the generosity of\r\nVespasian and Titus, that after so great wars and contests which they\r\nhad from us, they should use such moderation. But I will now return to\r\nthat part of my history whence I made the present digression.\r\n\r\n3. Now it happened that in the reign of Antiochus the Great, who ruled\r\nover all Asia, that the Jews, as well as the inhabitants of Celesyria,\r\nsuffered greatly, and their land was sorely harassed; for while he was\r\nat war with Ptolemy Philopater, and with his son, who was called\r\nEpiphanes, it fell out that these nations were equally sufferers, both\r\nwhen he was beaten, and when he beat the others: so that they were very\r\nlike to a ship in a storm, which is tossed by the waves on both sides;\r\nand just thus were they in their situation in the middle between\r\nAntiochus's prosperity and its change to adversity. But at length, when\r\nAntiochus had beaten Ptolemy, he seized upon Judea; and when Philopater\r\nwas dead, his son sent out a great army under Scopas, the general of his\r\nforces, against the inhabitants of Celesyria, who took many of their\r\ncities, and in particular our nation; which when he fell upon them, went\r\nover to him. Yet was it not long afterward when Antiochus overcame\r\nScopas, in a battle fought at the fountains of Jordan, and destroyed a\r\ngreat part of his army. But afterward, when Antiochus subdued those\r\ncities of Celesyria which Scopas had gotten into his possession, and\r\nSamaria with them, the Jews, of their own accord, went over to him, and\r\nreceived him into the city [Jerusalem], and gave plentiful provision to\r\nall his army, and to his elephants, and readily assisted him when he\r\nbesieged the garrison which was in the citadel of Jerusalem. Wherefore\r\nAntiochus thought it but just to requite the Jews' diligence and zeal in\r\nhis service. So he wrote to the generals of his armies, and to his\r\nfriends, and gave testimony to the good behavior of the Jews towards\r\nhim, and informed them what rewards he had resolved to bestow on them\r\nfor that their behavior. I will set down presently the epistles\r\nthemselves which he wrote to the generals concerning them, but will\r\nfirst produce the testimony of Polybius of Megalopolis; for thus does he\r\nspeak, in the sixteenth book of his history: \"Now Scopas, the general of\r\nPtolemy's army, went in haste to the superior parts of the country, and\r\nin the winter time overthrew the nation of the Jews?\" He also saith, in\r\nthe same book, that \"when Seopas was conquered by Antiochus, Antiochus\r\nreceived Batanea, and Samaria, and Abila, and Gadara; and that, a while\r\nafterwards, there came in to him those Jews that inhabited near that\r\ntemple which was called Jerusalem; concerning which, although I have\r\nmore to say, and particularly concerning the presence of God about that\r\ntemple, yet do I put off that history till another opportunity.\" This it\r\nis which Polybius relates. But we will return to the series of the\r\nhistory, when we have first produced the epistles of king Antiochus.\r\n\r\nKing Antiochus To Ptolemy, Sendeth Greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Since the Jews, upon our first entrance on their country, demonstrated\r\ntheir friendship towards us, and when we came to their city [Jerusalem],\r\nreceived us in a splendid manner, and came to meet us with their senate,\r\nand gave abundance of provisions to our soldiers, and to the elephants,\r\nand joined with us in ejecting the garrison of the Egyptians that were\r\nin the citadel, we have thought fit to reward them, and to retrieve the\r\ncondition of their city, which hath been greatly depopulated by such\r\naccidents as have befallen its inhabitants, and to bring those that have\r\nbeen scattered abroad back to the city. And, in the first place, we have\r\ndetermined, on account of their piety towards God, to bestow on them, as\r\na pension, for their sacrifices of animals that are fit for sacrifice,\r\nfor wine, and oil, and frankincense, the value of twenty thousand pieces\r\nof silver, and [six] sacred artabrae of fine flour, with one thousand\r\nfour hundred and sixty medimni of wheat, and three hundred and seventy-\r\nfive medimni of salt. And these payments I would have fully paid them,\r\nas I have sent orders to you. I would also have the work about the\r\ntemple finished, and the cloisters, and if there be any thing else that\r\nought to be rebuilt. And for the materials of wood, let it be brought\r\nthem out of Judea itself and out of the other countries, and out of\r\nLibanus tax free; and the same I would have observed as to those other\r\nmaterials which will be necessary, in order to render the temple more\r\nglorious; and let all of that nation live according to the laws of their\r\nown country; and let the senate, and the priests, and the scribes of the\r\ntemple, and the sacred singers, be discharged from poll-money and the\r\ncrown tax and other taxes also. And that the city may the sooner recover\r\nits inhabitants, I grant a discharge from taxes for three years to its\r\npresent inhabitants, and to such as shall come to it, until the month\r\nHyperheretus. We also discharge them for the future from a third part of\r\ntheir taxes, that the losses they have sustained may be repaired. And\r\nall those citizens that have been carried away, and are become slaves,\r\nwe grant them and their children their freedom, and give order that\r\ntheir substance be restored to them.\"\r\n\r\n4. And these were the contents of this epistle. He also published a\r\ndecree through all his kingdom in honor of the temple, which contained\r\nwhat follows: \"It shall be lawful for no foreigner to come within the\r\nlimits of the temple round about; which thing is forbidden also to the\r\nJews, unless to those who, according to their own custom, have purified\r\nthemselves. Nor let any flesh of horses, or of mules, or of asses, he\r\nbrought into the city, whether they be wild or tame; nor that of\r\nleopards, or foxes, or hares; and, in general, that of any animal which\r\nis forbidden for the Jews to eat. Nor let their skins be brought into\r\nit; nor let any such animal be bred up in the city. Let them only be\r\npermitted to use the sacrifices derived from their forefathers, with\r\nwhich they have been obliged to make acceptable atonements to God. And\r\nhe that transgresseth any of these orders, let him pay to the priests\r\nthree thousand drachmae of silver.\" Moreover, this Antiochus bare\r\ntestimony to our piety and fidelity, in an epistle of his, written when\r\nhe was informed of a sedition in Phrygia and Lydia, at which time he was\r\nin the superior provinces, wherein he commanded Zenxis, the general of\r\nhis forces, and his most intimate friend, to send some of our nation out\r\nof Babylon into Phrygia. The epistle was this:\r\n\r\nKing Antiochus To Zeuxis His Father, Sendeth Greeting.\r\n\r\n\"If you are in health, it is well. I also am in health. Having been\r\ninformed that a sedition is arisen in Lydia and Phrygia, I thought that\r\nmatter required great care; and upon advising with my friends what was\r\nfit to be done, it hath been thought proper to remove two thousand\r\nfamilies of Jews, with their effects, out of Mesopotamia and Babylon,\r\nunto the castles and places that lie most convenient; for I am persuaded\r\nthat they will be well-disposed guardians of our possessions, because of\r\ntheir piety towards God, and because I know that my predecessors have\r\nborne witness to them, that they are faithful, and with alacrity do what\r\nthey are desired to do. I will, therefore, though it be a laborious\r\nwork, that thou remove these Jews, under a promise, that they shall be\r\npermitted to use their own laws. And when thou shalt have brought them\r\nto the places forementioned, thou shalt give everyone of their families\r\na place for building their houses, and a portion of the land for their\r\nhusbandry, and for the plantation of their vines; and thou shalt\r\ndischarge them from paying taxes of the fruits of the earth for ten\r\nyears; and let them have a proper quantity of wheat for the maintenance\r\nof their servants, until they receive bread corn out of the earth; also\r\nlet a sufficient share be given to such as minister to them in the\r\nnecessaries of life, that by enjoying the effects of our humanity, they\r\nmay show themselves the more willing and ready about our affairs. Take\r\ncare likewise of that nation, as far as thou art able, that they may not\r\nhave any disturbance given them by any one.\" Now these testimonials\r\nwhich I have produced are sufficient to declare the friendship that\r\nAntiochus the Great bare to the Jews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How Antiochus Made A League With Ptolemy And How Onias\r\nProvoked Ptolemy Euergetes To Anger; And How Joseph Brought All Things\r\nRight Again, And Entered Into Friendship With Him; And What Other Things\r\nWere Done By Joseph, And His Son Hyrcanus.\r\n\r\n1. After this Antiochus made a friendship and league with Ptolemy, and\r\ngave him his daughter Cleopatra to wife, and yielded up to him\r\nCelesyria, and Samaria, and Judea, and Phoenicia, by way of dowry. And\r\nupon the division of the taxes between the two kings, all the principal\r\nmen framed the taxes of their several countries, and collecting the sum\r\nthat was settled for them, paid the same to the [two] kings. Now at this\r\ntime the Samaritans were in a flourishing condition, and much distressed\r\nthe Jews, cutting off parts of their land, and carrying off slaves. This\r\nhappened when Onias was high priest; for after Eleazar's death, his\r\nuncle Manasseh took the priesthood, and after he had ended his life,\r\nOnias received that dignity. He was the son of Simon, who was called The\r\nJust: which Simon was the brother of Eleazar, as I said before. This\r\nOnias was one of a little soul, and a great lover of money; and for that\r\nreason, because he did not pay that tax of twenty talents of silver,\r\nwhich his forefathers paid to these things out of their own estates, he\r\nprovoked king Ptolemy Euergetes to anger, who was the father of\r\nPhilopater. Euergetes sent an ambassador to Jerusalem, and complained\r\nthat Onias did not pay his taxes, and threatened, that if he did not\r\nreceive them, he would seize upon their land, and send soldiers to live\r\nupon it. When the Jews heard this message of the king, they were\r\nconfounded; but so sordidly covetous was Onias, that nothing of things\r\nnature made him ashamed.\r\n\r\n2. There was now one Joseph, young in age, but of great reputation among\r\nthe people of Jerusalem, for gravity, prudence, and justice. His\r\nfather's name was Tobias; and his mother was the sister of Onias the\r\nhigh priest, who informed him of the coming of the ambassador; for he\r\nwas then sojourning at a village named Phicol, 13 where he was born.\r\nHereupon he came to the city [Jerusalem], and reproved Onias for not\r\ntaking care of the preservation of his countrymen, but bringing the\r\nnation into dangers, by not paying this money. For which preservation of\r\nthem, he told him he had received the authority over them, and had been\r\nmade high priest; but that, in case he was so great a lover of money, as\r\nto endure to see his country in danger on that account, and his\r\ncountrymen suffer the greatest damages, he advised him to go to the\r\nking, and petition him to remit either the whole or a part of the sum\r\ndemanded. Onias's answer was this: That he did not care for his\r\nauthority, and that he was ready, if the thing were practicable, to lay\r\ndown his high priesthood; and that he would not go to the king, because\r\nhe troubled not himself at all about such matters. Joseph then asked him\r\nif he would not give him leave to go ambassador on behalf of the nation.\r\nHe replied, that he would give him leave. Upon which Joseph went up into\r\nthe temple, and called the multitude together to a congregation, and\r\nexhorted them not to be disturbed nor affrighted, because of his uncle\r\nOnias's carelessness, but desired them to be at rest, and not terrify\r\nthemselves with fear about it; for he promised them that he would be\r\ntheir ambassador to the king, and persuade him that they had done him no\r\nwrong. And when the multitude heard this, they returned thanks to\r\nJoseph. So he went down from the temple, and treated Ptolemy's\r\nambassador in a hospitable manner. He also presented him with rich\r\ngifts, and feasted him magnificently for many days, and then sent him to\r\nthe king before him, and told him that he would soon follow him; for he\r\nwas now more willing to go to the king, by the encouragement of the\r\nambassador, who earnestly persuaded him to come into Egypt, and promised\r\nhim that he would take care that he should obtain every thing that he\r\ndesired of Ptolemy; for he was highly pleased with his frank and liberal\r\ntemper, and with the gravity of his deportment.\r\n\r\n3. When Ptolemy's ambassador was come into Egypt, he told the king of\r\nthe thoughtless temper of Onias; and informed him of the goodness of the\r\ndisposition of Joseph; and that he was coming to him to excuse the\r\nmultitude, as not having done him any harm, for that he was their\r\npatron. In short, he was so very large in his encomiums upon the young\r\nman, that he disposed both the king and his wife Cleopatra to have a\r\nkindness for him before he came. So Joseph sent to his friends at\r\nSamaria, and borrowed money of them, and got ready what was necessary\r\nfor his journey, garments and cups, and beasts for burden, which\r\namounted to about twenty thousand drachmae, and went to Alexandria. Now\r\nit happened that at this time all the principal men and rulers went up\r\nout of the cities of Syria and Phoenicia, to bid for their taxes; for\r\nevery year the king sold them to the men of the greatest power in every\r\ncity. So these men saw Joseph journeying on the way, and laughed at him\r\nfor his poverty and meanness. But when he came to Alexandria, and heard\r\nthat king Ptolemy was at Memphis, he went up thither to meet with him;\r\nwhich happened as the king was sitting in his chariot, with his wife,\r\nand with his friend Athenion, who was the very person who had been\r\nambassador at Jerusalem, and had been entertained by Joseph. As soon\r\ntherefore as Athenion saw him, he presently made him known to the king,\r\nhow good and generous a young man he was. So Ptolemy saluted him first,\r\nand desired him to come up into his chariot; and as Joseph sat there, he\r\nbegan to complain of the management of Onias: to which he answered,\r\n\"Forgive him, on account of his age; for thou canst not certainly be\r\nunacquainted with this, that old men and infants have their minds\r\nexactly alike; but thou shalt have from us, who are young men, every\r\nthing thou desirest, and shalt have no cause to complain.\" With this\r\ngood humor and pleasantry of the young man, the king was so delighted,\r\nthat he began already, as though he had had long experience of him, to\r\nhave a still greater affection for him, insomuch that he bade him take\r\nhis diet in the king's palace, and be a guest at his own table every\r\nday. But when the king was come to Alexandria, the principal men of\r\nSyria saw him sitting with the king, and were much offended at it.\r\n\r\n4. And when the day came on which the king was to let the taxes of the\r\ncities to farm, and those that were the principal men of dignity in\r\ntheir several countries were to bid for them, the sum of the taxes\r\ntogether, of Celesyria, and Phoenicia, and Judea, with Samaria, [as they\r\nwere bidden for,] came to eight thousand talents. Hereupon Joseph\r\naccused the bidders, as having agreed together to estimate the value of\r\nthe taxes at too low a rate; and he promised that he would himself give\r\ntwice as much for them: but for those who did not pay, he would send the\r\nking home their whole substance; for this privilege was sold together\r\nwith the taxes themselves. The king was pleased to hear that offer; and\r\nbecause it augmented his revenues, he said he would confirm the sale of\r\nthe taxes to him. But when he asked him this question, Whether he had\r\nany sureties that would be bound for the payment of the money? he\r\nanswered very pleasantly, \"I will give such security, and those of\r\npersons good and responsible, and which you shall have no reason to\r\ndistrust.\" And when he bid him name them who they were, he replied, \"I\r\ngive thee no other persons, O king, for my sureties, than thyself, and\r\nthis thy wife; and you shall be security for both parties.\" So Ptolemy\r\nlaughed at the proposal, and granted him the farming of the taxes\r\nwithout any sureties. This procedure was a sore grief to those that came\r\nfrom the cities into Egypt, who were utterly disappointed; and they\r\nreturned every one to their own country with shame.\r\n\r\n5. But Joseph took with him two thousand foot soldiers from the king,\r\nfor he desired he might have some assistance, in order to force such as\r\nwere refractory in the cities to pay. And borrowing of the king's\r\nfriends at Alexandria five hundred talents, he made haste back into\r\nSyria. And when he was at Askelon, and demanded the taxes of the people\r\nof Askelon, they refused to pay any thing, and affronted him also; upon\r\nwhich he seized upon about twenty of the principal men, and slew them,\r\nand gathered what they had together, and sent it all to the king, and\r\ninformed him what he had done. Ptolemy admired the prudent conduct of\r\nthe man, and commended him for what he had done, and gave him leave to\r\ndo as he pleased. When the Syrians heard of this, they were astonished;\r\nand having before them a sad example in the men of Askelon that were\r\nslain, they opened their gates, and willingly admitted Joseph, and paid\r\ntheir taxes. And when the inhabitants of Scythopolis attempted to\r\naffront him, and would not pay him those taxes which they formerly used\r\nto pay, without disputing about them, he slew also the principal men of\r\nthat city, and sent their effects to the king. By this means he gathered\r\ngreat wealth together, and made vast gains by this farming of the taxes;\r\nand he made use of what estate he had thus gotten, in order to support\r\nhis authority, as thinking it a piece of prudence to keep what had been\r\nthe occasion and foundation of his present good fortune; and this he did\r\nby the assistance of what he was already possessed of, for he privately\r\nsent many presents to the king, and to Cleopatra, and to their friends,\r\nand to all that were powerful about the court, and thereby purchased\r\ntheir good-will to himself.\r\n\r\n6. This good fortune he enjoyed for twenty-two years, and was become the\r\nfather of seven sons by one wife; he had also another son, whose name\r\nwas Hyrcanus, by his brother Solymius's daughter, whom he married on the\r\nfollowing occasion. He once came to Alexandria with his brother, who had\r\nalong with him a daughter already marriageable, in order to give her in\r\nwedlock to some of the Jews of chief dignity there. He then supped with\r\nthe king, and falling in love with an actress that was of great beauty,\r\nand came into the room where they feasted, he told his brother of it,\r\nand entreated him, because a Jew is forbidden by their law to come near\r\nto a foreigner, to conceal his offense; and to be kind and subservient\r\nto him, and to give him an opportunity of fulfilling his desires. Upon\r\nwhich his brother willingly entertained the proposal of serving him, and\r\nadorned his own daughter, and brought her to him by night, and put her\r\ninto his bed. And Joseph, being disordered with drink, knew not who she\r\nwas, and so lay with his brother's daughter; and this did he many times,\r\nand loved her exceedingly; and said to his brother, that he loved this\r\nactress so well, that he should run the hazard of his life [if he must\r\npart with her], and yet probably the king would not give him leave [to\r\ntake her with him]. But his brother bid him be in no concern about that\r\nmatter, and told him he might enjoy her whom he loved without any\r\ndanger, and might have her for his wife; and opened the truth of the\r\nmatter to him, and assured him that he chose rather to have his own\r\ndaughter abused, than to overlook him, and see him come to [public]\r\ndisgrace. So Joseph commended him for this his brotherly love, and\r\nmarried his daughter; and by her begat a son, whose name was Hyrcanus,\r\nas we said before. And when this his youngest son showed, at thirteen\r\nyears old, a mind that was both courageous and wise, and was greatly\r\nenvied by his brethren, as being of a genius much above them, and such a\r\none as they might well envy, Joseph had once a mind to know which of his\r\nsons had the best disposition to virtue; and when he sent them severally\r\nto those that had then the best reputation for instructing youth, the\r\nrest of his children, by reason of their sloth and unwillingness to take\r\npains, returned to him foolish and unlearned. After them he sent out the\r\nyoungest, Hyrcanus, and gave him three hundred yoke of oxen, and bid him\r\ngo two days' journey into the wilderness, and sow the land there, and\r\nyet kept back privately the yokes of the oxen that coupled them\r\ntogether. When Hyrcanus came to the place, and found he had no yokes\r\nwith him, he condemned the drivers of the oxen, who advised him to send\r\nsome to his father, to bring them some yokes; but he thinking that he\r\nought not to lose his time while they should be sent to bring him the\r\nyokes, he invented a kind of stratagem, and what suited an age older\r\nthan his own; for he slew ten yoke of the oxen, and distributed their\r\nflesh among the laborers, and cut their hides into several pieces, and\r\nmade him yokes, and yoked the oxen together with them; by which means he\r\nsowed as much land as his father had appointed him to sow, and returned\r\nto him. And when he was come back, his father was mightily pleased with\r\nhis sagacity, and commended the sharpness of his understanding, and his\r\nboldness in what he did. And he still loved him the more, as if he were\r\nhis only genuine son, while his brethren were much troubled at it.\r\n\r\n7. But when one told him that Ptolemy had a son just born, and that all\r\nthe principal men of Syria, and the other countries subject to him, were\r\nto keep a festival, on account of the child's birthday, and went away in\r\nhaste with great retinues to Alexandria, he was himself indeed hindered\r\nfrom going by old age; but he made trial of his sons, whether any of\r\nthem would be willing to go to the king. And when the elder sons excused\r\nthemselves from going, and said they were not courtiers good enough for\r\nsuch conversation, and advised him to send their brother Hyrcanus, he\r\ngladly hearkened to that advice, and called Hyrcanus, and asked him\r\nwhether he would go to the king, and whether it was agreeable to him to\r\ngo or not. And upon his promise that he would go, and his saying that he\r\nshould not want much money for his journey, because he would live\r\nmoderately, and that ten thousand drachmas would be sufficient, he was\r\npleased with his son's prudence. After a little while, the son advised\r\nhis father not to send his presents to the king from thence, but to give\r\nhim a letter to his steward at Alexandria, that he might furnish him\r\nwith money, for purchasing what should be most excellent and most\r\nprecious. So he thinking that the expense of ten talents would be enough\r\nfor presents to be made the king, and commending his son, as giving him\r\ngood advice, wrote to Arion his steward, that managed all his money\r\nmatters at Alexandria; which money was not less than three thousand\r\ntalents on his account, for Joseph sent the money he received in Syria\r\nto Alexandria. And when the day appointed for the payment of the taxes\r\nto the king came, he wrote to Arion to pay them. So when the son had\r\nasked his father for a letter to the steward, and had received it, he\r\nmade haste to Alexandria. And when he was gone, his brethren wrote to\r\nall the king's friends, that they should destroy him.\r\n\r\n8. But when he was come to Alexandria, he delivered his letter to Arion,\r\nwho asked him how many talents he would have [hoping he would ask for no\r\nmore than ten, or a little more]; he said he wanted a thousand talents.\r\nAt which the steward was angry, and rebuked him, as one that intended to\r\nlive extravagantly; and he let him know how his father had gathered\r\ntogether his estate by painstaking, and resisting his inclinations, and\r\nwished him to imitate the example of his father: he assured him withal,\r\nthat he would give him but ten talents, and that for a present to the\r\nking also. The son was irritated at this, and threw Arion into prison.\r\nBut when Arion's wife had informed Cleopatra of this, with her entreaty,\r\nthat she would rebuke the child for what he had done, [for Arion was in\r\ngreat esteem with her,] Cleopatra informed the king of it. And Ptolemy\r\nsent for Hyrcanus, and told him that he wondered, when he was sent to\r\nhim by his father, that he had not yet come into his presence, but had\r\nlaid the steward in prison. And he gave order, therefore, that he should\r\ncome to him, and give an account of the reason of what he had done. And\r\nthey report that the answer he made to the king's messenger was this:\r\nThat \"there was a law of his that forbade a child that was born to taste\r\nof the sacrifice, before he had been at the temple and sacrificed to\r\nGod. According to which way of reasoning he did not himself come to him\r\nin expectation of the present he was to make to him, as to one who had\r\nbeen his father's benefactor; and that he had punished the slave for\r\ndisobeying his commands, for that it mattered not Whether a master was\r\nlittle or great: so that unless we punish such as these, thou thyself\r\nmayst also expect to be despised by thy subjects.\" Upon hearing this his\r\nanswer he fell a laughing, and wondered at the great soul of the child.\r\n\r\n9. When Arion was apprized that this was the king's disposition, and\r\nthat he had no way to help himself, he gave the child a thousand\r\ntalents, and was let out of prison. So after three days were over,\r\nHyrcanus came and saluted the king and queen. They saw him with\r\npleasure, and feasted him in an obliging manner, out of the respect they\r\nbare to his father. So he came to the merchants privately, and bought a\r\nhundred boys, that had learning, and were in the flower of their ages,\r\neach at a talent apiece; as also he bought a hundred maidens, each at\r\nthe same price as the other. And when he was invited to feast with the\r\nking among the principal men in the country, he sat down the lowest of\r\nthem all, because he was little regarded, as a child in age still; and\r\nthis by those who placed every one according to their dignity. Now when\r\nall those that sat with him had laid the bones Of the several parts on a\r\nheap before Hyrcanus, [for they had themselves taken away the flesh\r\nbelonging to them,] till the table where he sat was filled full with\r\nthem, Trypho, who was the king's jester, and was appointed for jokes and\r\nlaughter at festivals, was now asked by the guests that sat at the table\r\n[to expose him to laughter]. So he stood by the king, and said, \"Dost\r\nthou not see, my lord, the bones that lie by Hyrcanus? by this\r\nsimilitude thou mayst conjecture that his father made all Syria as bare\r\nas he hath made these bones.\" And the king laughing at what Trypho said,\r\nand asking of Hyrcanus, How he came to have so many bones before him? he\r\nreplied, \"Very rightfully, my lord; for they are dogs that eat the flesh\r\nand the bones together, as these thy guests have done, [looking in the\r\nmean time at those guests,] for there is nothing before them; but they\r\nare men that eat the flesh, and cast away the hones, as I, who am also a\r\nman, have now done.\" Upon which the king admired at his answer, which\r\nwas so wisely made; and bid them all make an acclamation, as a mark of\r\ntheir approbation of his jest, which was truly a facetious one. On the\r\nnext day Hyrcanus went to every one of the king's friends, and of the\r\nmen powerful at court, and saluted them; but still inquired of the\r\nservants what present they would make the king on his son's birthday;\r\nand when some said that they would give twelve talents, and that others\r\nof greater dignity would every one give according to the quantity of\r\ntheir riches, he pretended to every one of them to be grieved that he\r\nwas not able to bring so large a present; for that he had no more than\r\nfive talents. And when the servants heard what he said, they told their\r\nmasters; and they rejoiced in the prospect that Joseph would be\r\ndisapproved, and would make the king angry, by the smallness of his\r\npresent. When the day came, the others, even those that brought the\r\nmost, offered the king not above twenty talents; but Hyrcanus gave to\r\nevery one of the hundred boys and hundred maidens that he had bought a\r\ntalent apiece, for them to carry, and introduced them, the boys to the\r\nking, and the maidens to Cleopatra; every body wondering at the\r\nunexpected richness of the presents, even the king and queen themselves.\r\nHe also presented those that attended about the king with gifts to the\r\nvalue of a great number of talents, that he might escape the danger he\r\nwas in from them; for to these it was that Hyrcanus's brethren had\r\nwritten to destroy him. Now Ptolemy admired at the young man's\r\nmagnanimity, and commanded him to ask what gift he pleased. But he\r\ndesired nothing else to be done for him by the king than to write to his\r\nfather and brethren about him. So when the king had paid him very great\r\nrespects, and had given him very large gifts, and had written to his\r\nfather and his brethren, and all his commanders and officers, about him,\r\nhe sent him away. But when his brethren heard that Hyrcanus had received\r\nsuch favors from the king, and was returning home with great honor, they\r\nwent out to meet him, and to destroy him, and that with the privity of\r\ntheir father; for he was angry at him for the [large] sum of money that\r\nhe bestowed for presents, and so had no concern for his preservation.\r\nHowever, Joseph concealed the anger he had at his son, out of fear of\r\nthe king. And when Hyrcanus's brethren came to fight him, he slew many\r\nothers of those that were with them, as also two of his brethren\r\nthemselves; but the rest of them escaped to Jerusalem to their father.\r\nBut when Hyrcanus came to the city, where nobody would receive him, he\r\nwas afraid for himself, and retired beyond the river Jordan, and there\r\nabode, but obliging the barbarians to pay their taxes.\r\n\r\n10. At this time Seleucus, who was called Soter, reigned over Asia,\r\nbeing the son of Antiochus the Great. And [now] Hyrcanus's father,\r\nJoseph, died. He was a good man, and of great magnanimity; and brought\r\nthe Jews out of a state of poverty and meanness, to one that was more\r\nsplendid. He retained the farm of the taxes of Syria, and Phoenicia, and\r\nSamaria twenty-two years. His uncle also, Onias, died [about this time],\r\nand left the high priesthood to his son Simeon. And when he was dead,\r\nOnias his son succeeded him in that dignity. To him it was that Areus,\r\nking of the Lacedemonians, sent an embassage, with an epistle; the copy\r\nwhereof here follows:\r\n\r\n\"Areus, King Of The Lacedemonians, To Onias, Sendeth Greeting.\r\n\r\n\"We have met with a certain writing, whereby we have discovered that\r\nboth the Jews and the Lacedemonians are of one stock, and are derived\r\nfrom the kindred of Abraham 14 It is but just therefore that you, who\r\nare our brethren, should send to us about any of your concerns as you\r\nplease. We will also do the same thing, and esteem your concerns as our\r\nown, and will look upon our concerns as in common with yours. Demoteles,\r\nwho brings you this letter, will bring your answer back to us. This\r\nletter is four-square; and the seal is an eagle, with a dragon in his\r\nclaws.\"\r\n\r\n11. And these were the contents of the epistle which was sent from the\r\nking of the Lacedemonians. But, upon the death of Joseph, the people\r\ngrew seditious, on account of his sons. For whereas the elders made war\r\nagainst Hyrcanus, who was the youngest of Joseph's sons, the multitude\r\nwas divided, but the greater part joined with the elders in this war; as\r\ndid Simon the high priest, by reason he was of kin to them. However,\r\nHyrcanus determined not to return to Jerusalem any more, but seated\r\nhimself beyond Jordan, and was at perpetual war with the Arabians, and\r\nslew many of them, and took many of them captives. He also erected a\r\nstrong castle, and built it entirely of white stone to the very roof,\r\nand had animals of a prodigious magnitude engraven upon it. He also drew\r\nround it a great and deep canal of water. He also made caves of many\r\nfurlongs in length, by hollowing a rock that was over against him; and\r\nthen he made large rooms in it, some for feasting, and some for sleeping\r\nand living in. He introduced also a vast quantity of waters which ran\r\nalong it, and which were very delightful and ornamental in the court.\r\nBut still he made the entrances at the mouth of the caves so narrow,\r\nthat no more than one person could enter by them at once. And the reason\r\nwhy he built them after that manner was a good one; it was for his own\r\npreservation, lest he should be besieged by his brethren, and run the\r\nhazard of being caught by them. Moreover, he built courts of greater\r\nmagnitude than ordinary, which he adorned with vastly large gardens. And\r\nwhen he had brought the place to this state, he named it Tyre. This\r\nplace is between Arabia and Judea, beyond Jordan, not far from the\r\ncountry of Heshbon. And he ruled over those parts for seven years, even\r\nall the time that Seleucus was king of Syria. But when he was dead, his\r\nbrother Antiochus, who was called Epiphanes, took the kingdom. Ptolemy\r\nalso, the king of Egypt, died, who was besides called Epiphanes. He left\r\ntwo sons, and both young in age; the elder of which was called\r\nPhilometer, and the youngest Physcon. As for Hyrcanus, when he saw that\r\nAntiochus had a great army, and feared lest he should be caught by him,\r\nand brought to punishment for what he had done to the Arabians, he ended\r\nhis life, and slew himself with his own hand; while Antiochus seized\r\nupon all his substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.

About this time, upon the death of Onias the high priest, they gave\r\nthe high priesthood to Jesus his brother; for that son which Onias left\r\n[or Onias IV.] was yet but an infant; and, in its proper place, we will\r\ninform the reader of all the circumstances that befell this child. But\r\nthis Jesus, who was the brother of Onias, was deprived of the high\r\npriesthood by the king, who was angry with him, and gave it to his\r\nyounger brother, whose name also was Onias; for Simon had these three\r\nsons, to each of which the priesthood came, as we have already informed\r\nthe reader. This Jesus changed his name to Jason, but Onias was called\r\nMenelaus. Now as the former high priest, Jesus, raised a sedition\r\nagainst Menelaus, who was ordained after him, the multitude were divided\r\nbetween them both. And the sons of Tobias took the part of Menelaus, but\r\nthe greater part of the people assisted Jason; and by that means\r\nMenelaus and the sons of Tobias were distressed, and retired to\r\nAntiochus, and informed him that they were desirous to leave the laws of\r\ntheir country, and the Jewish way of living according to them, and to\r\nfollow the king's laws, and the Grecian way of living. Wherefore they\r\ndesired his permission to build them a Gymnasium at Jerusalem. 15 And\r\nwhen he had given them leave, they also hid the circumcision of their\r\ngenitals, that even when they were naked they might appear to be Greeks.\r\nAccordingly, they left off all the customs that belonged to their own\r\ncountry, and imitated the practices of the other nations.\r\n\r\n2. Now Antiochus, upon the agreeable situation of the affairs of his\r\nkingdom, resolved to make an expedition against Egypt, both because he\r\nhad a desire to gain it, and because he contemned the son of Ptolemy, as\r\nnow weak, and not yet of abilities to manage affairs of such\r\nconsequence; so he came with great forces to Pelusium, and circumvented\r\nPtolemy Philometor by treachery, and seized upon Egypt. He then came to\r\nthe places about Memphis; and when he had taken them, he made haste to\r\nAlexandria, in hopes of taking it by siege, and of subduing Ptolemy, who\r\nreigned there. But he was driven not only from Alexandria, but out of\r\nall Egypt, by the declaration of the Romans, who charged him to let that\r\ncountry alone; according as I have elsewhere formerly declared. I will\r\nnow give a particular account of what concerns this king, how he subdued\r\nJudea and the temple; for in my former work I mentioned those things\r\nvery briefly, and have therefore now thought it necessary to go over\r\nthat history again, and that with great accuracy.\r\n\r\n3. King Antiochus returning out of Egypt 16 for fear of the Romans, made\r\nan expedition against the city Jerusalem; and when he was there, in the\r\nhundred and forty-third year of the kingdom of the Seleucidse, he took\r\nthe city without fighting, those of his own party opening the gates to\r\nhim. And when he had gotten possession of Jerusalem, he slew many of the\r\nopposite party; and when he had plundered it of a great deal of money,\r\nhe returned to Antioch.\r\n\r\n4. Now it came to pass, after two years, in the hundred forty and fifth\r\nyear, on the twenty-fifth day of that month which is by us called\r\nChasleu, and by the Macedonians Apelleus, in the hundred and fifty-third\r\nolympiad, that the king came up to Jerusalem, and, pretending peace, he\r\ngot possession of the city by treachery; at which time he spared not so\r\nmuch as those that admitted him into it, on account of the riches that\r\nlay in the temple; but, led by his covetous inclination, [for he saw\r\nthere was in it a great deal of gold, and many ornaments that had been\r\ndedicated to it of very great value,] and in order to plunder its\r\nwealth, he ventured to break the league he had made. So he left the\r\ntemple bare, and took away the golden candlesticks, and the golden altar\r\n[of incense], and table [of shew-bread], and the altar [of burnt-\r\noffering]; and did not abstain from even the veils, which were made of\r\nfine linen and scarlet. He also emptied it of its secret treasures, and\r\nleft nothing at all remaining; and by this means cast the Jews into\r\ngreat lamentation, for he forbade them to offer those daily sacrifices\r\nwhich they used to offer to God, according to the law. And when he had\r\npillaged the whole city, some of the inhabitants he slew, and some he\r\ncarried captive, together with their wives and children, so that the\r\nmultitude of those captives that were taken alive amounted to about ten\r\nthousand. He also burnt down the finest buildings; and when he had\r\noverthrown the city walls, he built a citadel in the lower part of the\r\ncity, 17 for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which\r\naccount he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a\r\ngarrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and\r\nwicked part of the [Jewish] multitude, from whom it proved that the\r\ncitizens suffered many and sore calamities. And when the king had built\r\nan idol altar upon God's altar, he slew swine upon it, and so offered a\r\nsacrifice neither according to the law, nor the Jewish religious worship\r\nin that country. He also compelled them to forsake the worship which\r\nthey paid their own God, and to adore those whom he took to be gods; and\r\nmade them build temples, and raise idol altars in every city and\r\nvillage, and offer swine upon them every day. He also commanded them not\r\nto circumcise their sons, and threatened to punish any that should be\r\nfound to have transgressed his injunction. He also appointed overseers,\r\nwho should compel them to do what he commanded. And indeed many Jews\r\nthere were who complied with the king's commands, either voluntarily, or\r\nout of fear of the penalty that was denounced. But the best men, and\r\nthose of the noblest souls, did not regard him, but did pay a greater\r\nrespect to the customs of their country than concern as to the\r\npunishment which he threatened to the disobedient; on which account they\r\nevery day underwent great miseries and bitter torments; for they were\r\nwhipped with rods, and their bodies were torn to pieces, and were\r\ncrucified, while they were still alive, and breathed. They also\r\nstrangled those women and their sons whom they had circumcised, as the\r\nking had appointed, hanging their sons about their necks as they were\r\nupon the crosses. And if there were any sacred book of the law found, it\r\nwas destroyed, and those with whom they were found miserably perished\r\nalso.\r\n\r\n5. When the Samaritans saw the Jews under these sufferings, they no\r\nlonger confessed that they were of their kindred, nor that the temple on\r\nMount Gerizzim belonged to Almighty God. This was according to their\r\nnature, as we have already shown. And they now said that they were a\r\ncolony of Medes and Persians; and indeed they were a colony of theirs.\r\nSo they sent ambassadors to Antiochus, and an epistle, whose contents\r\nare these: \"To king Antiochus the god, Epiphanes, a memorial from the\r\nSidonians, who live at Shechem. Our forefathers, upon certain frequent\r\nplagues, and as following a certain ancient superstition, had a custom\r\nof observing that day which by the Jews is called the Sabbath. 18 And\r\nwhen they had erected a temple at the mountain called Gerrizzim, though\r\nwithout a name, they offered upon it the proper sacrifices. Now, upon\r\nthe just treatment of these wicked Jews, those that manage their\r\naffairs, supposing that we were of kin to them, and practiced as they\r\ndo, make us liable to the same accusations, although we be originally\r\nSidonians, as is evident from the public records. We therefore beseech\r\nthee, our benefactor and Savior, to give order to Apollonius, the\r\ngovernor of this part of the country, and to Nicanor, the procurator of\r\nthy affairs, to give us no disturbance, nor to lay to our charge what\r\nthe Jews are accused for, since we are aliens from their nation, and\r\nfrom their customs; but let our temple, which at present hath no name at\r\nall be named the Temple of Jupiter Hellenius. If this were once done, we\r\nshould be no longer disturbed, but should be more intent on our own\r\noccupation with quietness, and so bring in a greater revenue to thee.\"\r\nWhen the Samaritans had petitioned for this, the king sent them back the\r\nfollowing answer, in an epistle: \"King Antiochus to Nicanor. The\r\nSidonians, who live at Shechem, have sent me the memorial enclosed. When\r\ntherefore we were advising with our friends about it, the messengers\r\nsent by them represented to us that they are no way concerned with\r\naccusations which belong to the Jews, but choose to live after the\r\ncustoms of the Greeks. Accordingly, we declare them free from such\r\naccusations, and order that, agreeable to their petition, their temple\r\nbe named the Temple of Jupiter Hellenius.\" He also sent the like epistle\r\nto Apollonius, the governor of that part of the country, in the forty-\r\nsixth year, and the eighteenth day of the month Hecatorabeom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How, Upon Antiochus's Prohibition To The Jews To Make Use Of\r\nThe Laws Of Their Country Mattathias, The Son Of Asamoneus, Alone\r\nDespised The King, And Overcame The Generals Of Antiochus's Army; As\r\nAlso Concerning The Death Of Mattathias, And The Succession Of Judas.\r\n\r\n1. Now at this time there was one whose name was Mattathias, who dwelt\r\nat Modin, the son of John, the son of Simeon, the son of Asamoneus, a\r\npriest of the order of Joarib, and a citizen of Jerusalem. He had five\r\nsons; John, who was called Gaddis, and Simon, who was called Matthes,\r\nand Judas, who was called Maccabeus, 19 and Eleazar, who was called\r\nAuran, and Jonathan, who was called Apphus. Now this Mattathias lamented\r\nto his children the sad state of their affairs, and the ravage made in\r\nthe city, and the plundering of the temple, and the calamities the\r\nmultitude were under; and he told them that it was better for them to\r\ndie for the laws of their country, than to live so ingloriously as they\r\nthen did.\r\n\r\n2. But when those that were appointed by the king were come to Modin,\r\nthat they might compel the Jews to do what they were commanded, and to\r\nenjoin those that were there to offer sacrifice, as the king had\r\ncommanded, they desired that Mattathias, a person of the greatest\r\ncharacter among them, both on other accounts, and particularly on\r\naccount of such a numerous and so deserving a family of children, would\r\nbegin the sacrifice, because his fellow citizens would follow his\r\nexample, and because such a procedure would make him honored by the\r\nking. But Mattathias said he would not do it; and that if all the other\r\nnations would obey the commands of Antiochus, either out of fear, or to\r\nplease him, yet would not he nor his sons leave the religious worship of\r\ntheir country. But as soon as he had ended his speech, there came one of\r\nthe Jews into the midst of them, and sacrificed, as Antiochus had\r\ncommanded. At which Mattathias had great indignation, and ran upon him\r\nviolently, with his sons, who had swords with them, and slew both the\r\nman himself that sacrificed, and Apelles the king's general, who\r\ncompelled them to sacrifice, with a few of his soldiers. He also\r\noverthrew the idol altar, and cried out, \"If,\" said he, \"any one be\r\nzealous for the laws of his country, and for the worship of God, let him\r\nfollow me.\" And when he had said this, he made haste into the desert\r\nwith his sons, and left all his substance in the village. Many others\r\ndid the same also, and fled with their children and wives into the\r\ndesert, and dwelt in caves. But when the king's generals heard this,\r\nthey took all the forces they then had in the citadel at Jerusalem, and\r\npursued the Jews into the desert; and when they had overtaken them, they\r\nin the first place endeavored to persuade them to repent, and to choose\r\nwhat was most for their advantage, and not put them to the necessity of\r\nusing them according to the law of war. But when they would not comply\r\nwith their persuasions, but continued to be of a different mind, they\r\nfought against them on the sabbath day, and they burnt them as they were\r\nin the caves, without resistance, and without so much as stopping up the\r\nentrances of the caves. And they avoided to defend themselves on that\r\nday, because they were not willing to break in upon the honor they owed\r\nthe sabbath, even in such distresses; for our law requires that we rest\r\nupon that day. There were about a thousand, with their wives and\r\nchildren, who were smothered and died in these caves; but many of those\r\nthat escaped joined themselves to Mattathias, and appointed him to be\r\ntheir ruler, who taught them to fight, even on the sabbath day; and told\r\nthem that unless they would do so, they would become their own enemies,\r\nby observing the law [so rigorously], while their adversaries would\r\nstill assault them on this day, and they would not then defend\r\nthemselves, and that nothing could then hinder but they must all perish\r\nwithout fighting. This speech persuaded them. And this rule continues\r\namong us to this day, that if there be a necessity, we may fight on\r\nsabbath days. So Mattathias got a great army about him, and overthrew\r\ntheir idol altars, and slew those that broke the laws, even all that he\r\ncould get under his power; for many of them were dispersed among the\r\nnations round about them for fear of him. He also commanded that those\r\nboys which were not yet circumcised should be circumcised now; and he\r\ndrove those away that were appointed to hinder such their circumcision.\r\n\r\n3. But when he had ruled one year, and was fallen into a distemper, he\r\ncalled for his sons, and set them round about him, and said, \"O my sons,\r\nI am going the way of all the earth; and I recommend to you my\r\nresolution, and beseech you not to be negligent in keeping it, but to be\r\nmindful of the desires of him who begat you, and brought you up, and to\r\npreserve the customs of your country, and to recover your ancient form\r\nof government, which is in danger of being overturned, and not to be\r\ncarried away with those that, either by their own inclination, or out of\r\nnecessity, betray it, but to become such sons as are worthy of me; to be\r\nabove all force and necessity, and so to dispose your souls, as to be\r\nready, when it shall be necessary, to die for your laws; as sensible of\r\nthis, by just reasoning, that if God see that you are so disposed he\r\nwill not overlook you, but will have a great value for your virtue, and\r\nwill restore to you again what you have lost, and will return to you\r\nthat freedom in which you shall live quietly, and enjoy your own\r\ncustoms. Your bodies are mortal, and subject to fate; but they receive a\r\nsort of immortality, by the remembrance of what actions they have done.\r\nAnd I would have you so in love with this immortality, that you may\r\npursue after glory, and that, when you have undergone the greatest\r\ndifficulties, you may not scruple, for such things, to lose your lives.\r\nI exhort you, especially, to agree one with another; and in what\r\nexcellency any one of you exceeds another, to yield to him so far, and\r\nby that means to reap the advantage of every one's own virtues. Do you\r\nthen esteem Simon as your father, because he is a man of extraordinary\r\nprudence, and be governed by him in what counsels be gives you. Take\r\nMaccabeus for the general of your army, because of his courage and\r\nstrength, for he will avenge your nation, and will bring vengeance on\r\nyour enemies. Admit among you the righteous and religious, and augment\r\ntheir power.\"\r\n\r\n4. When Mattathias had thus discoursed to his sons, and had prayed to\r\nGod to be their assistant, and to recover to the people their former\r\nconstitution, he died a little afterward, and was buried at Modin; all\r\nthe people making great lamentation for him. Whereupon his son Judas\r\ntook upon him the administration of public affairs, in the hundred forty\r\nand sixth year; and thus, by the ready assistance of his brethren, and\r\nof others, Judas cast their enemies out of the country, and put those of\r\ntheir own country to death who had transgressed its laws, and purified\r\nthe land of all the pollutions that were in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How Judas Overthrew The Forces Of Apollonius And Seron And\r\nKilled The Generals Of Their Armies Themselves; And How When, A Little\r\nWhile Afterwards Lysias And Gorgias Were Beaten He Went Up To Jerusalem\r\nAnd Purified The Temple.\r\n\r\n1. When Apollonius, the general of the Samaritan forces, heard this, he\r\ntook his army, and made haste to go against Judas, who met him, and\r\njoined battle with him, and beat him, and slew many of his men, and\r\namong them Apollonius himself, their general, whose sword being that\r\nwhich he happened then to wear, he seized upon, and kept for himself;\r\nbut he wounded more than he slew, and took a great deal of prey from the\r\nenemy's camp, and went his way. But when Seron, who was general of the\r\narmy of Celesyria, heard that many had joined themselves to Judas, and\r\nthat he had about him an army sufficient for fighting, and for making\r\nwar, he determined to make an expedition against him, as thinking it\r\nbecame him to endeavor to punish those that transgressed the king's\r\ninjunctions. He then got together an army, as large as he was able, and\r\njoined to it the runagate and wicked Jews, and came against Judas. He\r\ncame as far as Bethhoron, a village of Judea, and there pitched his\r\ncamp; upon which Judas met him; and when he intended to give him battle,\r\nhe saw that his soldiers were backward to fight, because their number\r\nwas small, and because they wanted food, for they were fasting, he\r\nencouraged them, and said to them, that victory and conquest of enemies\r\nare not derived from the multitude in armies, but in the exercise of\r\npiety towards God; and that they had the plainest instances in their\r\nforefathers, who, by their righteousness, exerting themselves on behalf\r\nof their own laws, and their own children, had frequently conquered many\r\nten thousands,—for innocence is the strongest army. By this speech he\r\ninduced his men to condemn the multitude of the enemy, and to fall upon\r\nSeron. And upon joining battle with him, he beat the Syrians; and when\r\ntheir general fell among the rest, they all ran away with speed, as\r\nthinking that to be their best way of escaping. So he pursued them unto\r\nthe plain, and slew about eight hundred of the enemy; but the rest\r\nescaped to the region which lay near to the sea.\r\n\r\n2. When king Antiochus heard of these things, he was very angry at what\r\nhad happened; so he got together all his own army, with many\r\nmercenaries, whom he had hired from the islands, and took them with him,\r\nand prepared to break into Judea about the beginning of the spring. But\r\nwhen, upon his mustering his soldiers, he perceived that his treasures\r\nwere deficient, and there was a want of money in them, for all the taxes\r\nwere not paid, by reason of the seditions there had been among the\r\nnations he having been so magnanimous and so liberal, that what he had\r\nwas not sufficient for him, he therefore resolved first to go into\r\nPersia, and collect the taxes of that country. Hereupon he left one\r\nwhose name was Lysias, who was in great repute with him governor of the\r\nkingdom, as far as the bounds of Egypt, and of the Lower Asia, and\r\nreaching from the river Euphrates, and committed to him a certain part\r\nof his forces, and of his elephants, and charged him to bring up his son\r\nAntiochus with all possible care, until he came back; and that he should\r\nconquer Judea, and take its inhabitants for slaves, and utterly destroy\r\nJerusalem, and abolish the whole nation. And when king Antiochus had\r\ngiven these things in charge to Lysias, he went into Persia; and in the\r\nhundred and forty-seventh year he passed over Euphrates, and went to the\r\nsuperior provinces.\r\n\r\n3. Upon this Lysias chose Ptolemy, the son of Dorymenes, and Nicanor,\r\nand Gorgias, very potent men among the king's friends, and delivered to\r\nthem forty thousand foot soldiers, and seven thousand horsemen, and sent\r\nthem against Judea, who came as far as the city Emmaus, and pitched\r\ntheir camp in the plain country. There came also to them auxiliaries out\r\nof Syria, and the country round about; as also many of the runagate\r\nJews. And besides these came some merchants to buy those that should be\r\ncarried captives, [having bonds with them to bind those that should be\r\nmade prisoners,] with that silver and gold which they were to pay for\r\ntheir price. And when Judas saw their camp, and how numerous their\r\nenemies were, he persuaded his own soldiers to be of good courage, and\r\nexhorted them to place their hopes of victory in God, and to make\r\nsupplication to him, according to the custom of their country, clothed\r\nin sackcloth; and to show what was their usual habit of supplication in\r\nthe greatest dangers, and thereby to prevail with God to grant you the\r\nvictory over your enemies. So he set them in their ancient order of\r\nbattle used by their forefathers, under their captains of thousands, and\r\nother officers, and dismissed such as were newly married, as well as\r\nthose that had newly gained possessions, that they might not fight in a\r\ncowardly manner, out of an inordinate love of life, in order to enjoy\r\nthose blessings. When he had thus disposed his soldiers, he encouraged\r\nthem to fight by the following speech, which he made to them: \"O my\r\nfellow soldiers, no other time remains more opportune than the present\r\nfor courage and contempt of dangers; for if you now fight manfully, you\r\nmay recover your liberty, which, as it is a thing of itself agreeable to\r\nall men, so it proves to be to us much more desirable, by its affording\r\nus the liberty of worshipping God. Since therefore you are in such\r\ncircumstances at present, you must either recover that liberty, and so\r\nregain a happy and blessed way of living, which is that according to our\r\nlaws, and the customs of our country, or to submit to the most\r\nopprobrious sufferings; nor will any seed of your nation remain if you\r\nbe beat in this battle. Fight therefore manfully; and suppose that you\r\nmust die, though you do not fight; but believe, that besides such\r\nglorious rewards as those of the liberty of your country, of your laws,\r\nof your religion, you shall then obtain everlasting glory. Prepare\r\nyourselves, therefore, and put yourselves into such an agreeable\r\nposture, that you may be ready to fight with the enemy as soon as it is\r\nday tomorrow morning.\"\r\n\r\n4. And this was the speech which Judas made to encourage them. But when\r\nthe enemy sent Gorgias, with five thousand foot and one thousand horse,\r\nthat he might fall upon Judas by night, and had for that purpose certain\r\nof the runagate Jews as guides, the son of Mattathias perceived it, and\r\nresolved to fall upon those enemies that were in their camp, now their\r\nforces were divided. When they had therefore supped in good time, and\r\nhad left many fires in their camp, he marched all night to those enemies\r\nthat were at Emmaus. So that when Gorgias found no enemy in their camp,\r\nbut suspected that they were retired, and had hidden themselves among\r\nthe mountains, he resolved to go and seek them wheresoever they were.\r\nBut about break of day Judas appeared to those enemies that were at\r\nEmmaus, with only three thousand men, and those ill armed, by reason of\r\ntheir poverty; and when he saw the enemy very well and skillfully\r\nfortified in their camp, he encouraged the Jews, and told them that they\r\nought to fight, though it were with their naked bodies, for that God had\r\nsometimes of old given such men strength, and that against such as were\r\nmore in number, and were armed also, out of regard to their great\r\ncourage. So he commanded the trumpeters to sound for the battle; and by\r\nthus falling upon the enemies when they did not expect it, and thereby\r\nastonishing and disturbing their minds, he slew many of those that\r\nresisted him, and went on pursuing the rest as far as Gadara, and the\r\nplains of Idumea, and Ashdod, and Jamnia; and of these there fell about\r\nthree thousand. Yet did Judas exhort his soldiers not to be too desirous\r\nof the spoils, for that still they must have a contest and battle with\r\nGorgias, and the forces that were with him; but that when they had once\r\novercome them, then they might securely plunder the camp, because they\r\nwere the only enemies remaining, and they expected no others. And just\r\nas he was speaking to his soldiers, Gorgias's men looked down into that\r\narmy which they left in their camp, and saw that it was overthrown, and\r\nthe camp burnt; for the smoke that arose from it showed them, even when\r\nthey were a great way off, what had happened. When therefore those that\r\nwere with Gorgias understood that things were in this posture, and\r\nperceived that those that were with Judas were ready to fight them, they\r\nalso were affrighted, and put to flight; but then Judas, as though he\r\nhad already beaten Gorgias's soldiers without fighting, returned and\r\nseized on the spoils. He took a great quantity of gold, and silver, and\r\npurple, and blue, and then returned home with joy, and singing hymns to\r\nGod for their good success; for this victory greatly contributed to the\r\nrecovery of their liberty.\r\n\r\n5. Hereupon Lysias was confounded at the defeat of the army which he had\r\nsent, and the next year he got together sixty thousand chosen men. He\r\nalso took five thousand horsemen, and fell upon Judea; and he went up to\r\nthe hill country of Bethsur, a village of Judea, and pitched his camp\r\nthere, where Judas met him with ten thousand men; and when he saw the\r\ngreat number of his enemies, he prayed to God that he would assist him,\r\nand joined battle with the first of the enemy that appeared, and beat\r\nthem, and slew about five thousand of them, and thereby became terrible\r\nto the rest of them. Nay, indeed, Lysias observing the great spirit of\r\nthe Jews, how they were prepared to die rather than lose their liberty,\r\nand being afraid of their desperate way of fighting, as if it were real\r\nstrength, he took the rest of the army back with him, and returned to\r\nAntioch, where he listed foreigners into the service, and prepared to\r\nfall upon Judea with a greater army.\r\n\r\n6. When therefore the generals of Antiochus's armies had been beaten so\r\noften, Judas assembled the people together, and told them, that after\r\nthese many victories which God had given them, they ought to go up to\r\nJerusalem, and purify the temple, and offer the appointed sacrifices.\r\nBut as soon as he, with the whole multitude, was come to Jerusalem, and\r\nfound the temple deserted, and its gates burnt down, and plants growing\r\nin the temple of their own accord, on account of its desertion, he and\r\nthose that were with him began to lament, and were quite confounded at\r\nthe sight of the temple; so he chose out some of his soldiers, and gave\r\nthem order to fight against those guards that were in the citadel, until\r\nhe should have purified the temple. When therefore he had carefully\r\npurged it, and had brought in new vessels, the candlestick, the table\r\n[of shew-bread], and the altar [of incense], which were made of gold, he\r\nhung up the veils at the gates, and added doors to them. He also took\r\ndown the altar [of burnt-offering], and built a new one of stones that\r\nhe gathered together, and not of such as were hewn with iron tools. So\r\non the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, which the Macedonians\r\ncall Apeliens, they lighted the lamps that were on the candlestick, and\r\noffered incense upon the altar [of incense], and laid the loaves upon\r\nthe table [of shew-bread], and offered burnt-offerings upon the new\r\naltar [of burnt-offering]. Now it so fell out, that these things were\r\ndone on the very same day on which their Divine worship had fallen off,\r\nand was reduced to a profane and common use, after three years' time;\r\nfor so it was, that the temple was made desolate by Antiochus, and so\r\ncontinued for three years. This desolation happened to the temple in the\r\nhundred forty and fifth year, on the twenty-fifth day of the month\r\nApeliens, and on the hundred fifty and third olympiad: but it was\r\ndedicated anew, on the same day, the twenty-fifth of the month Apeliens,\r\non the hundred and forty-eighth year, and on the hundred and fifty-\r\nfourth olympiad. And this desolation came to pass according to the\r\nprophecy of Daniel, which was given four hundred and eight years before;\r\nfor he declared that the Macedonians would dissolve that worship [for\r\nsome time].\r\n\r\n7. Now Judas celebrated the festival of the restoration of the\r\nsacrifices of the temple for eight days, and omitted no sort of\r\npleasures thereon; but he feasted them upon very rich and splendid\r\nsacrifices; and he honored God, and delighted them by hymns and psalms.\r\nNay, they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after\r\na long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom\r\nof their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they\r\nshould keep a festival, on account of the restoration of their temple\r\nworship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this\r\nfestival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was, because this\r\nliberty beyond our hopes appeared to us; and that thence was the name\r\ngiven to that festival. Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the\r\ncity, and reared towers of great height against the incursions of\r\nenemies, and set guards therein. He also fortified the city Bethsura,\r\nthat it might serve as a citadel against any distresses that might come\r\nfrom our enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. How Judas Subdued The Nations Round About; And How Simon Beat\r\nThe People Of Tyre And Ptolemais; And How Judas Overcame Timotheus, And\r\nForced Him To Fly Away, And Did Many Other Things After Joseph And\r\nAzarias Had Been Beaten.\r\n\r\n1. When these things were over, the nations round about the Jews were\r\nvery uneasy at the revival of their power, and rose up together, and\r\ndestroyed many of them, as gaining advantage over them by laying snares\r\nfor them, and making secret conspiracies against them. Judas made\r\nperpetual expeditions against these men, and endeavored to restrain them\r\nfrom those incursions, and to prevent the mischiefs they did to the\r\nJews. So he fell upon the Idumeans, the posterity of Esau, at\r\nAcrabattene, and slew a great many of them, and took their spoils. He\r\nalso shut up the sons of Bean, that laid wait for the Jews; and he sat\r\ndown about them, and besieged them, and burnt their towers, and\r\ndestroyed the men [that were in them]. After this he went thence in\r\nhaste against the Ammonites, who had a great and a numerous army, of\r\nwhich Timotheus was the commander. And when he had subdued them, he\r\nseized on the city Jazer, and took their wives and their children\r\ncaptives, and burnt the city, and then returned into Judea. But when the\r\nneighboring nations understood that he was returned, they got together\r\nin great numbers in the land of Gilead, and came against those Jews that\r\nwere at their borders, who then fled to the garrison of Dathema; and\r\nsent to Judas, to inform him that Timotheus was endeavoring to take the\r\nplace whither they were fled. And as these epistles were reading, there\r\ncame other messengers out of Galilee, who informed him that the\r\ninhabitants of Ptolemais, and of Tyre and Sidon, and strangers of\r\nGalilee, were gotten together.\r\n\r\n2. Accordingly Judas, upon considering what was fit to be done, with\r\nrelation to the necessity both these cases required, gave order that\r\nSimon his brother should take three thousand chosen men, and go to the\r\nassistance of the Jews in Galilee, while he and another of his brothers,\r\nJonathan, made haste into the land of Gilead, with eight thousand\r\nsoldiers. And he left Joseph, the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, to be\r\nover the rest of the forces; and charged them to keep Judea very\r\ncarefully, and to fight no battles with any persons whomsoever until his\r\nreturn. Accordingly, Simon went into Galilee, and fought the enemy, and\r\nput them to flight, and pursued them to the very gates of Ptolemais, and\r\nslew about three thousand of them, and took the spoils of those that\r\nwere slain, and those Jews whom they had made captives, with their\r\nbaggage, and then returned home.\r\n\r\n3. Now as for Judas Maccabeus, and his brother Jonathan, they passed\r\nover the river Jordan; and when they had gone three days journey, they\r\nlighted upon the Nabateans, who came to meet them peaceably, and who\r\ntold them how the affairs of those in the land of Gilead stood; and how\r\nmany of them were in distress, and driven into garrisons, and into the\r\ncities of Galilee; and exhorted him to make haste to go against the\r\nforeigners, and to endeavor to save his own countrymen out of their\r\nhands. To this exhortation Judas hearkened, and returned to the\r\nwilderness; and in the first place fell upon the inhabitants of Bosor,\r\nand took the city, and beat the inhabitants, and destroyed all the\r\nmales, and all that were able to fight, and burnt the city. Nor did he\r\nstop even when night came on, but he journeyed in it to the garrison\r\nwhere the Jews happened to be then shut up, and where Timotheus lay\r\nround the place with his army. And Judas came upon the city in the\r\nmorning; and when he found that the enemy were making an assault upon\r\nthe walls, and that some of them brought ladders, on which they might\r\nget upon those walls, and that others brought engines [to batter them],\r\nhe bid the trumpeter to sound his trumpet, and he encouraged his\r\nsoldiers cheerfully to undergo dangers for the sake of their brethren\r\nand kindred; he also parted his army into three bodies, and fell upon\r\nthe backs of their enemies. But when Timotheus's men perceived that it\r\nwas Maccabeus that was upon them, of both whose courage and good success\r\nin war they had formerly had sufficient experience, they were put to\r\nflight; but Judas followed them with his army, and slew about eight\r\nthousand of them. He then turned aside to a city of the foreigners\r\ncalled Malle, and took it, and slew all the males, and burnt the city\r\nitself. He then removed from thence, and overthrew Casphom and Bosor,\r\nand many other cities of the land of Gilead.\r\n\r\n4. But not long after this, Timotheus prepared a great army, and took\r\nmany others as auxiliaries; and induced some of the Arabians, by the\r\npromise of rewards, to go with him in this expedition, and came with his\r\narmy beyond the brook, over against the city Raphon; and he encouraged\r\nhis soldiers, if it came to a battle with the Jews, to fight\r\ncourageously, and to hinder their passing over the brook; for he said to\r\nthem beforehand, that \"if they come over it, we shall be beaten.\" And\r\nwhen Judas heard that Timotheus prepared himself to fight, he took all\r\nhis own army, and went in haste against Timotheus his enemy; and when he\r\nhad passed over the brook, he fell upon his enemies, and some of them\r\nmet him, whom he slew, and others of them he so terrified, that he\r\ncompelled them to throw down their arms and fly; and some of them\r\nescaped, but some of them fled to what was called the Temple of Camaim,\r\nand hoped thereby to preserve themselves; but Judas took the city, and\r\nslew them, and burnt the temple, and so used several ways of destroying\r\nhis enemies.\r\n\r\n5. When he had done this, he gathered the Jews together, with their\r\nchildren and wives, and the substance that belonged to them, and was\r\ngoing to bring them back into Judea; but as soon as he was come to a\r\ncertain city, whose name was Ephron, that lay upon the road, [and it was\r\nnot possible for him to go any other way, so he was not willing to go\r\nback again,] he then sent to the inhabitants, and desired that they\r\nwould open their gates, and permit them to go on their way through the\r\ncity; for they had stopped up the gates with stones, and cut off their\r\npassage through it. And when the inhabitants of Ephron would not agree\r\nto this proposal, he encouraged those that were with him, and\r\nencompassed the city round, and besieged it, and, lying round it by day\r\nand night, took the city, and slew every male in it, and burnt it all\r\ndown, and so obtained a way through it; and the multitude of those that\r\nwere slain was so great, that they went over the dead bodies. So they\r\ncame over Jordan, and arrived at the great plain, over against which is\r\nsituate the city Bethshah, which is called by the Greeks Scythopolis. 20\r\nAnd going away hastily from thence, they came into Judea, singing psalms\r\nand hymns as they went, and indulging such tokens of mirth as are usual\r\nin triumphs upon victory. They also offered thank-offerings, both for\r\ntheir good success, and for the preservation of their army, for not one\r\nof the Jews was slain in these battles.21\r\n\r\n6. But as to Joseph, the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, whom Judas left\r\ngenerals [of the rest of his forces] at the same time when Simon was in\r\nGalilee, fighting against the people of Ptolemais, and Judas himself,\r\nand his brother Jonathan, were in the land of Gilead, did these men also\r\naffect the glory of being courageous generals in war, in order whereto\r\nthey took the army that was under their command, and came to Jamnia.\r\nThere Gorgias, the general of the forces of Jamnia, met them; and upon\r\njoining battle with him, they lost two thousand of their army, 22 and\r\nfled away, and were pursued to the very borders of Judea. And this\r\nmisfortune befell them by their disobedience to what injunctions Judas\r\nhad given them, not to fight with any one before his return. For besides\r\nthe rest of Judas's sagacious counsels, one may well wonder at this\r\nconcerning the misfortune that befell the forces commanded by Joseph and\r\nAzarias, which he understood would happen, if they broke any of the\r\ninjunctions he had given them. But Judas and his brethren did not leave\r\noff fighting with the Idumeans, but pressed upon them on all sides, and\r\ntook from them the city of Hebron, and demolished all its\r\nfortifications, and set all its towers on fire, and burnt the country of\r\nthe foreigners, and the city Marissa. They came also to Ashdod, and took\r\nit, and laid it waste, and took away a great deal of the spoils and prey\r\nthat were in it, and returned to Judea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. Concerning The Death Of Antiochus Epiphane. How Antiochus\r\nEupator Fought Against Juda And Besieged Him In The Temple And\r\nAfterwards Made Peace With Him And Departed; Of Alcimus And Onias.\r\n\r\n1. About this time it was that king Antiochus, as he was going over the\r\nupper countries, heard that there was a very rich city in Persia, called\r\nElymais; and therein a very rich temple of Diana, and that it was full\r\nof all sorts of donations dedicated to it; as also weapons and\r\nbreastplates, which, upon inquiry, he found had been left there by\r\nAlexander, the son of Philip, king of Macedonia. And being incited by\r\nthese motives, he went in haste to Elymais, and assaulted it, and\r\nbesieged it. But as those that were in it were not terrified at his\r\nassault, nor at his siege, but opposed him very courageously, he was\r\nbeaten off his hopes; for they drove him away from the city, and went\r\nout and pursued after him, insomuch that he fled away as far as Babylon,\r\nand lost a great many of his army. And when he was grieving for this\r\ndisappointment, some persons told him of the defeat of his commanders\r\nwhom he had left behind him to fight against Judea, and what strength\r\nthe Jews had already gotten. When this concern about these affairs was\r\nadded to the former, he was confounded, and by the anxiety he was in\r\nfell into a distemper, which, as it lasted a great while, and as his\r\npains increased upon him, so he at length perceived he should die in a\r\nlittle time; so he called his friends to him, and told them that his\r\ndistemper was severe upon him; and confessed withal, that this calamity\r\nwas sent upon him for the miseries he had brought upon the Jewish\r\nnation, while he plundered their temple, and contemned their God; and\r\nwhen he had said this, he gave up the ghost. Whence one may wonder at\r\nPolybius of Megalopolis, who, though otherwise a good man, yet saith\r\nthat \"Antiochus died because he had a purpose to plunder the temple of\r\nDiana in Persia;\" for the purposing to do a thing, 23 but not actually\r\ndoing it, is not worthy of punishment. But if Polybius could think that\r\nAntiochus thus lost his life on that account, it is much more probable\r\nthat this king died on account of his sacrilegious plundering of the\r\ntemple at Jerusalem. But we will not contend about this matter with\r\nthose who may think that the cause assigned by this Polybius of\r\nMegalopolis is nearer the truth than that assigned by us.\r\n\r\n2. However, Antiochus, before he died, called for Philip, who was one of\r\nhis companions, and made him the guardian of his kingdom; and gave him\r\nhis diadem, and his garment, and his ring, and charged him to carry\r\nthem, and deliver them to his son Antiochus; and desired him to take\r\ncare of his education, and to preserve the kingdom for him. 24 This\r\nAntiochus died in the hundred forty and ninth year; but it was Lysias\r\nthat declared his death to the multitude, and appointed his son\r\nAntiochus to be king, [of whom at present he had the care,] and called\r\nhim Eupator.\r\n\r\n3. At this time it was that the garrison in the citadel of Jerusalem,\r\nwith the Jewish runagates, did a great deal of harm to the Jews; for the\r\nsoldiers that were in that garrison rushed out upon the sudden, and\r\ndestroyed such as were going up to the temple in order to offer their\r\nsacrifices, for this citadel adjoined to and overlooked the temple. When\r\nthese misfortunes had often happened to them, Judas resolved to destroy\r\nthat garrison; whereupon he got all the people together, and vigorously\r\nbesieged those that were in the citadel. This was in the hundred and\r\nfiftieth year of the dominion of the Seleucidse. So he made engines of\r\nwar, and erected bulwarks, and very zealously pressed on to take the\r\ncitadel. But there were not a few of the runagates who were in the place\r\nthat went out by night into the country, and got together some other\r\nwicked men like themselves, and went to Antiochus the king, and desired\r\nof him that he would not suffer them to be neglected, under the great\r\nhardships that lay upon them from those of their own nation; and this\r\nbecause their sufferings were occasioned on his father's account, while\r\nthey left the religious worship of their fathers, and preferred that\r\nwhich he had commanded them to follow: that there was danger lest the\r\ncitadel, and those appointed to garrison it by the king, should be taken\r\nby Judas, and those that were with him, unless he would send them\r\nsuccors. When Antiochus, who was but a child, heard this, he was angry,\r\nand sent for his captains and his friends, and gave order that they\r\nshould get an army of mercenaries together, with such men also of his\r\nown kingdom as were of an age fit for war. Accordingly, an army was\r\ncollected of about a hundred thousand footmen, and twenty thousand\r\nhorsemen, and thirty-two elephants.\r\n\r\n4. So the king took this army, and marched hastily out of Antioch, with\r\nLysias, who had the command of the whole, and came to Idumea, and thence\r\nwent up to the city Bethsura, a city that was strong, and not to be\r\ntaken without great difficulty. He set about this city, and besieged it.\r\nAnd while the inhabitants of Bethsura courageously opposed him, and\r\nsallied out upon him, and burnt his engines of war, a great deal of time\r\nwas spent in the siege. But when Judas heard of the king's coming, he\r\nraised the siege of the citadel, and met the king, and pitched his camp\r\nin certain straits, at a place called Bethzachriah, at the distance of\r\nseventy furlongs from the enemy; but the king soon drew his forces from\r\nBethsura, and brought them to those straits. And as soon as it was day,\r\nhe put his men in battle-array, and made his elephants follow one\r\nanother through the narrow passes, because they could not be set\r\nsideways by one another. Now round about every elephant there were a\r\nthousand footmen, and five hundred horsemen. The elephants also had high\r\ntowers [upon their backs], and archers [in them]. And he also made the\r\nrest of his army to go up the mountains, and put his friends before the\r\nrest; and gave orders for the army to shout aloud, and so he attacked\r\nthe enemy. He also exposed to sight their golden and brazen shields, so\r\nthat a glorious splendor was sent from them; and when they shouted the\r\nmountains echoed again. When Judas saw this, he was not terrified, but\r\nreceived the enemy with great courage, and slew about six hundred of the\r\nfirst ranks. But when his brother Eleazar, whom they called Auran, saw\r\nthe tallest of all the elephants armed with royal breastplates, and\r\nsupposed that the king was upon him, he attacked him with great\r\nquickness and bravery. He also slew many of those that were about the\r\nelephant, and scattered the rest, and then went under the belly of the\r\nelephant, and smote him, and slew him; so the elephant fell upon\r\nEleazar, and by his weight crushed him to death. And thus did this man\r\ncome to his end, when he had first courageously destroyed many of his\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n5. But Judas, seeing the strength of the enemy, retired to Jerusalem,\r\nand prepared to endure a siege. As for Antiochus, he sent part of his\r\narmy to Bethsura, to besiege it, and with the rest of his army he came\r\nagainst Jerusalem; but the inhabitants of Bethsura were terrified at his\r\nstrength; and seeing that their provisions grew scarce, they delivered\r\nthemselves up on the security of oaths that they should suffer no hard\r\ntreatment from the king. And when Antiochus had thus taken the city, he\r\ndid them no other harm than sending them out naked. He also placed a\r\ngarrison of his own in the city. But as for the temple of Jerusalem, he\r\nlay at its siege a long time, while they within bravely defended it; for\r\nwhat engines soever the king set against them, they set other engines\r\nagain to oppose them. But then their provisions failed them; what fruits\r\nof the ground they had laid up were spent and the land being not\r\nploughed that year, continued unsowed, because it was the seventh year,\r\non which, by our laws, we are obliged to let it lay uncultivated. And\r\nwithal, so many of the besieged ran away for want of necessaries, that\r\nbut a few only were left in the temple.\r\n\r\n6. And these happened to be the circumstances of such as were besieged\r\nin the temple. But then, because Lysias, the general of the army, and\r\nAntiochus the king, were informed that Philip was coming upon them out\r\nof Persia, and was endeavoring to get the management of public affairs\r\nto himself, they came into these sentiments, to leave the siege, and to\r\nmake haste to go against Philip; yet did they resolve not to let this be\r\nknown to the soldiers or to the officers: but the king commanded Lysias\r\nto speak openly to the soldiers and the officers, without saying a word\r\nabout the business of Philip; and to intimate to them that the siege\r\nwould be very long; that the place was very strong; that they were\r\nalready in want of provisions; that many affairs of the kingdom wanted\r\nregulation; and that it was much better to make a league with the\r\nbesieged, and to become friends to their whole nation, by permitting\r\nthem to observe the laws of their fathers, while they broke out into\r\nthis war only because they were deprived of them, and so to depart home.\r\nWhen Lysias had discoursed thus to them, both the army and the officers\r\nwere pleased with this resolution.\r\n\r\n7. Accordingly the king sent to Judas, and to those that were besieged\r\nwith them, and promised to give them peace, and to permit them to make\r\nuse of, and live according to, the laws of their fathers; and they\r\ngladly received his proposals; and when they had gained security upon\r\noath for their performance, they went out of the temple. But when\r\nAntiochus came into it, and saw how strong the place was, he broke his\r\noaths, and ordered his army that was there to pluck down the walls to\r\nthe ground; and when he had so done, he returned to Antioch. He also\r\ncarried with him Onias the high priest, who was also called Menelaus;\r\nfor Lysias advised the king to slay Menelaus, if he would have the Jews\r\nbe quiet, and cause him no further disturbance, for that this man was\r\nthe origin of all the mischief the Jews had done them, by persuading his\r\nfather to compel the Jews to leave the religion of their fathers. So the\r\nking sent Menelaus to Berea, a city of Syria, and there had him put to\r\ndeath, when he had been high priest ten years. He had been a wicked and\r\nan impious man; and, in order to get the government to himself, had\r\ncompelled his nation to transgress their own laws. After the death of\r\nMenelaus, Alcimus, who was also called Jacimus, was made high priest.\r\nBut when king Antiochus found that Philip had already possessed himself\r\nof the government, he made war against him, and subdued him, and took\r\nhim, and slew him. Now as to Onias, the son of the high priest, who, as\r\nwe before informed you, was left a child when his father died, when he\r\nsaw that the king had slain his uncle Menelaus, and given the high\r\npriesthood to Alcimus, who was not of the high priest stock, but was\r\ninduced by Lysias to translate that dignity from his family to another\r\nhouse, he fled to Ptolemy, king of Egypt; and when he found he was in\r\ngreat esteem with him, and with his wife Cleopatra, he desired and\r\nobtained a place in the Nomus of Heliopolis, wherein he built a temple\r\nlike to that at Jerusalem; of which therefore we shall hereafter give an\r\naccount, in a place more proper for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. How Bacchides, The General Of Demetrius's Army, Made An\r\nExpedition Against Judea, And Returned Without Success; And How Nicanor\r\nWas Sent A Little Afterward Against Judas And Perished, Together With\r\nHis Army; As Also Concerning The Death Of Alcimus And The Succession Of\r\nJudas.\r\n\r\n1. About the same time Demetrius, the son of Seleucus, fled away from\r\nRome, and took Tripoli, a city of Syria, and set the diadem on his own\r\nhead. He also gathered certain mercenary soldiers together, and entered\r\ninto his kingdom, and was joyfully received by all, who delivered\r\nthemselves up to him. And when they had taken Autiochus the king, and\r\nLysias, they brought them to him alive; both which were immediately put\r\nto death by the command of Demetrius, when Antiochus had reigned two\r\nyears, as we have already elsewhere related. But there were now many of\r\nthe wicked Jewish runagates that came together to him, and with them\r\nAlcimus the high priest, who accused the whole nation, and particularly\r\nJudas and his brethren; and said that they had slain all his friends,\r\nand that those in his kingdom that were of his party, and waited for his\r\nreturn, were by them put to death; that these men had ejected them out\r\nof their own country, and caused them to be sojourners in a foreign\r\nland; and they desired that he would send some one of his own friends,\r\nand know from him what mischief Judas's party had done.\r\n\r\n2. At this Demetrius was very angry, and sent Bacchides, a friend of\r\nAntiochus Epiphanes, 25 a good man, and one that had been intrusted with\r\nall Mesopotamia, and gave him an army, and committed Alcimus the high\r\npriest to his care; and gave him charge to slay Judas, and those that\r\nwere with him. So Bacchides made haste, and went out of Antioch with his\r\narmy; and when he was come into Judea, he sent to Judas and his\r\nbrethren, to discourse with them about a league of friendship and peace,\r\nfor he had a mind to take him by treachery. But Judas did not give\r\ncredit to him, for he saw that he came with so great an army as men do\r\nnot bring when they come to make peace, but to make war. However, some\r\nof the people acquiesced in what Bacchides caused to be proclaimed; and\r\nsupposing they should undergo no considerable harm from Alcimus, who was\r\ntheir countryman, they went over to them; and when they had received\r\noaths from both of them, that neither they themselves, nor those of the\r\nsame sentiments, should come to any harm, they intrusted themselves with\r\nthem. But Bacchides troubled not himself about the oaths he had taken,\r\nbut slew threescore of them, although, by not keeping his faith with\r\nthose that first went over, he deterred all the rest, who had intentions\r\nto go over to him, from doing it. But as he was gone out of Jerusalem,\r\nand was at the village called Bethzetho, he sent out, and caught many of\r\nthe deserters, and some of the people also, and slew them all; and\r\nenjoined all that lived in the country to submit to Alcimus. So he left\r\nhim there, with some part of the army, that he might have wherewith to\r\nkeep the country in obedience and returned to Antioch to king Demetrius.\r\n\r\n3. But Alcimus was desirous to have the dominion more firmly assured to\r\nhim; and understanding that, if he could bring it about that the\r\nmultitude should be his friends, he should govern with greater security,\r\nhe spake kind words to them all, and discoursed to each of them after an\r\nagreeable and pleasant manner; by which means he quickly had a great\r\nbody of men and an army about him, although the greater part of them\r\nwere of the wicked, and the deserters. With these, whom he used as his\r\nservants and soldiers, he went all over the country, and slew all that\r\nhe could find of Judas's party. But when Judas saw that Alcimus was\r\nalready become great, and had destroyed many of the good and holy men of\r\nthe country, he also went all over the country, and destroyed those that\r\nwere of the other party. But when Alcimus saw that he was not able to\r\noppose Judas, nor was equal to him in strength, he resolved to apply\r\nhimself to king Demetrius for his assistance; so he came to Antioch, and\r\nirritated him against Judas, and accused him, alleging that he had\r\nundergone a great many miseries by his means, and that he would do more\r\nmischief unless he were prevented, and brought to punishment, which must\r\nbe done by sending a powerful force against him.\r\n\r\n4. So Demetrius, being already of opinion that it would be a thing\r\npernicious to his own affairs to overlook Judas, now he was becoming so\r\ngreat, sent against him Nicanor, the most kind and most faithful of all\r\nhis friends; for he it was who fled away with him from the city of Rome.\r\nHe also gave him as many forces as he thought sufficient for him to\r\nconquer Judas withal, and bid him not to spare the nation at all. When\r\nNicanor was come to Jerusalem, he did not resolve to fight Judas\r\nimmediately, but judged it better to get him into his power by\r\ntreachery; so he sent him a message of peace, and said there was no\r\nmanner of necessity for them to fight and hazard themselves; and that he\r\nwould give him his oath that he would do him no harm, for that he only\r\ncame with some friends, in order to let him know what king Demetrius's\r\nintentions were, and what opinion he had of their nation. When Nicanor\r\nhad delivered this message, Judas and his brethren complied with him,\r\nand suspecting no deceit, they gave him assurances of friendship, and\r\nreceived Nicanor and his army; but while he was saluting Judas, and they\r\nwere talking together, he gave a certain signal to his own soldiers,\r\nupon which they were to seize upon Judas; but he perceived the\r\ntreachery, and ran back to his own soldiers, and fled away with them. So\r\nupon this discovery of his purpose, and of the snares laid for Judas,\r\nNicanor determined to make open war with him, and gathered his army\r\ntogether, and prepared for fighting him; and upon joining battle with\r\nhim at a certain village called Capharsalama, he beat Judas, 26 and\r\nforced him to fly to that citadel which was at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n5. And when Nicanor came down from the citadel unto the temple, some of\r\nthe priests and elders met him, and saluted him; and showed him the\r\nsacrifices which they offered to God for the king: upon which he\r\nblasphemed, and threatened them, that unless the people would deliver up\r\nJudas to him, upon his return he would pull down their temple. And when\r\nhe had thus threatened them, he departed from Jerusalem. But the priests\r\nfell into tears out of grief at what he had said, and besought God to\r\ndeliver them from their enemies But now for Nicanor, when he was gone\r\nout of Jerusalem, and was at a certain village called Bethoron, he there\r\npitched his camp, another army out of Syria having joined him. And Judas\r\npitched his camp at Adasa, another village, which was thirty furlongs\r\ndistant from Bethoron, having no more than one thousand soldiers. And\r\nwhen he had encouraged them not to be dismayed at the multitude of their\r\nenemies, nor to regard how many they were against whom they were going\r\nto fight, but to consider who they themselves were, and for what great\r\nrewards they hazarded themselves, and to attack the enemy courageously,\r\nhe led them out to fight, and joining battle with Nicanor, which proved\r\nto be a severe one, he overcame the enemy, and slew many of them; and at\r\nlast Nicanor himself, as he was fighting gloriously, fell:—upon whose\r\nfall the army did not stay; but when they had lost their general, they\r\nwere put to flight, and threw down their arms. Judas also pursued them\r\nand slew them, and gave notice by the sound of the trumpets to the\r\nneighboring villages that he had conquered the enemy; which, when the\r\ninhabitants heard, they put on their armor hastily, and met their\r\nenemies in the face as they were running away, and slew them, insomuch\r\nthat not one of them escaped out of this battle, who were in number nine\r\nthousand This victory happened to fall on the thirteenth day of that\r\nmonth which by the Jews is called Adar and by the Macedonians Dystrus;\r\nand the Jews thereon celebrate this victory every year, and esteem it as\r\na festival day. After which the Jewish nation were, for a while, free\r\nfrom wars, and enjoyed peace; but afterward they returned into their\r\nformer state of wars and hazards.\r\n\r\n6. But now as the high priest Alcimus, was resolving to pull down the\r\nwall of the sanctuary, which had been there of old time, and had been\r\nbuilt by the holy prophets, he was smitten suddenly by God, and fell\r\ndown. 27 This stroke made him fall down speechless upon the ground; and\r\nundergoing torments for many days, he at length died, when he had been\r\nhigh priest four years. And when he was dead, the people bestowed the\r\nhigh priesthood on Judas; who hearing of the power of the Romans, and\r\nthat they had conquered in war Galatia, and Iberia, and Carthage, and\r\nLibya; and that, besides these, they had subdued Greece, and their\r\nkings, Perseus, and Philip, and Antiochus the Great also; he resolved to\r\nenter into a league of friendship with them. He therefore sent to Rome\r\nsome of his friends, Eupolemus the son of John, and Jason the son of\r\nEleazar, and by them desired the Romans that they would assist them, and\r\nbe their friends, and would write to Demetrius that he would not fight\r\nagainst the Jews. So the senate received the ambassadors that came from\r\nJudas to Rome, and discoursed with them about the errand on which they\r\ncame, and then granted them a league of assistance. They also made a\r\ndecree concerning it, and sent a copy of it into Judea. It was also laid\r\nup in the capitol, and engraven in brass. The decree itself was this:\r\n\"The decree of the senate concerning a league of assistance and\r\nfriendship with the nation of the Jews. It shall not be lawful for any\r\nthat are subject to the Romans to make war with the nation of the Jews,\r\nnor to assist those that do so, either by sending them corn, or ships,\r\nor money; and if any attack be made upon the Jews, the Romans shall\r\nassist them, as far as they are able; and again, if any attack be made\r\nupon the Romans, the Jews shall assist them. And if the Jews have a mind\r\nto add to, or to take away any thing from, this league of assistance,\r\nthat shall be done with the common consent of the Romans. And whatsoever\r\naddition shall thus be made, it shall be of force.\" This decree was\r\nwritten by Eupolemus the son of John, and by Jason the son of Eleazar,\r\n28 when Judas was high priest of the nation, and Simon his brother was\r\ngeneral of the army. And this was the first league that the Romans made\r\nwith the Jews, and was managed after this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. That Bacchides Was Again Sent Out Against Judas; And How\r\nJudas Fell As He Was Courageously Fighting.\r\n\r\n1. But when Demetrius was informed of the death of Nicanor, and of the\r\ndestruction of the army that was with him, he sent Bacchides again with\r\nan army into Judea, who marched out of Antioch, and came into Judea, and\r\npitched his camp at Arbela, a city of Galilee; and having besieged and\r\ntaken those that were there in caves, [for many of the people fled into\r\nsuch places,] he removed, and made all the haste he could to Jerusalem.\r\nAnd when he had learned that Judas had pitched his camp at a certain\r\nvillage whose name was Bethzetho, he led his army against him: they were\r\ntwenty thousand foot-men, and two thousand horsemen. Now Judas had no\r\nmore soldiers than one thousand. 29 When these saw the multitude of\r\nBacchides's men, they were afraid, and left their camp, and fled all\r\naway, excepting eight hundred. Now when Judas was deserted by his own\r\nsoldiers, and the enemy pressed upon him, and gave him no time to gather\r\nhis army together, he was disposed to fight with Bacchides's army,\r\nthough he had but eight hundred men with him; so he exhorted these men\r\nto undergo the danger courageously, and encouraged them to attack the\r\nenemy. And when they said they were not a body sufficient to fight so\r\ngreat an army, and advised that they should retire now, and save\r\nthemselves and that when he had gathered his own men together, then he\r\nshould fall upon the enemy afterwards, his answer was this: \"Let not the\r\nsun ever see such a thing, that I should show my back to the enemy and\r\nalthough this be the time that will bring me to my end, and I must die\r\nin this battle, I will rather stand to it courageously, and bear\r\nwhatsoever comes upon me, than by now running away bring reproach upon\r\nmy former great actions, or tarnish their glory.\" This was the speech he\r\nmade to those that remained with him, whereby he encouraged them to\r\nattack the enemy.\r\n\r\n2. But Bacchldes drew his army out of their camp, and put them in array\r\nfor the battle. He set the horsemen on both the wings, and the light\r\nsoldiers and the archers he placed before the whole army, but he was\r\nhimself on the right wing. And when he had thus put his army in order of\r\nbattle, and was going to join battle with the enemy, he commanded the\r\ntrumpeter to give a signal of battle, and the army to make a shout, and\r\nto fall on the enemy. And when Judas had done the same, he joined battle\r\nwith them; and as both sides fought valiantly, and the battle continued\r\ntill sun-set, Judas saw that Bacehides and the strongest part of the\r\narmy was in the right wing, and thereupon took the most courageous men\r\nwith him, and ran upon that part of the army, and fell upon those that\r\nwere there, and broke their ranks, and drove them into the middle, and\r\nforced them to run away, and pursued them as far as to a mountain called\r\nAza: but when those of the left wing saw that the right wing was put to\r\nflight, they encompassed Judas, and pursued him, and came behind him,\r\nand took him into the middle of their army; so being not able to fly,\r\nbut encompassed round about with enemies, he stood still, and he and\r\nthose that were with him fought; and when he had slain a great many of\r\nthose that came against him, he at last was himself wounded, and fell\r\nand gave up the ghost, and died in a way like to his former famous\r\nactions. When Judas was dead, those that were with him had no one whom\r\nthey could regard [as their commander]; but when they saw themselves\r\ndeprived of such a general, they fled. But Simon and Jonathan, Judas's\r\nbrethren, received his dead body by a treaty from the enemy, and carried\r\nit to the village of Modin, where their father had been buried, and\r\nthere buried him; while the multitude lamented him many days, and\r\nperformed the usual solemn rites of a funeral to him. And this was the\r\nend that Judas came to. He had been a man of valor and a great warrior,\r\nand mindful of the commands of their father Matrathins; and had\r\nundergone all difficulties, both in doing and suffering, for the liberty\r\nof his countrymen. And when his character was so excellent [while he was\r\nalive], he left behind him a glorious reputation and memorial, by\r\ngaining freedom for his nation, and delivering them from slavery under\r\nthe Macedonians. And when he had retained the high priesthood three\r\nyears, he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Here Josephus uses the very word koinopltagia, \"eating\r\nthings common,\" for \"eating things unclean;\" as does our New Testament,\r\nActs 10:14, 15, 28; 11:8, 9; Romans 14:14.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ The great number of these Jews and Samaritans that were\r\nformerly carried into Egypt by Alexander, and now by Ptolemy the son of\r\nLagus, appear afterwards in the vast multitude who as we shall see\r\npresently, were soon ransomed by Philadelphus, and by him made free,\r\nbefore he sent for the seventy-two interpreters; in the many garrisons\r\nand other soldiers of that nation in Egypt; in the famous settlement of\r\nJews, and the number of their synagogues at Alexandria, long afterward;\r\nand in the vehement contention between the Jews and Samatitans under\r\nPhilometer, about the place appointed for public worship in the law of\r\nMoses, whether at the Jewish temple of Jerusalem, or at the Samaritan\r\ntemple of Gerizzim; of all which our author treats hereafter.

Containing The Interval Of Eighty-Two Years.—From The Death\r\nOf Judas Maccabeus To The Death Of Queen Alexandra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. How Jonathan Took The Government After His Brother Judas; And\r\nHow He, Together With His Brother Simon, Waged War Against Bacchides.\r\n\r\n1. By what means the nation of the Jews recovered their freedom when\r\nthey had been brought into slavery by the Macedonians, and what\r\nstruggles, and how great battles, Judas, the general of their army, ran\r\nthrough, till he was slain as he was fighting for them, hath been\r\nrelated in the foregoing book; but after he was dead, all the wicked,\r\nand those that transgressed the laws of their forefathers, sprang up\r\nagain in Judea, and grew upon them, and distressed them on every side. A\r\nfamine also assisted their wickedness, and afflicted the country, till\r\nnot a few, who by reason of their want of necessaries, and because they\r\nwere not able to bear up against the miseries that both the famine and\r\ntheir enemies brought upon them, deserted their country, and went to the\r\nMacedonians. And now Bacchides gathered those Jews together who had\r\napostatized from the accustomed way of living of their forefathers, and\r\nchose to live like their neighbors, and committed the care of the\r\ncountry to them, who also caught the friends of Judas, and those of his\r\nparty, and delivered them up to Bacchides, who when he had, in the first\r\nplace, tortured and tormented them at his pleasure, he, by that means,\r\nat length killed them. And when this calamity of the Jews was become so\r\ngreat, as they had never had experience of the like since their return\r\nout of Babylon, those that remained of the companions of Judas, seeing\r\nthat the nation was ready to be destroyed after a miserable manner, came\r\nto his brother Jonathan, and desired him that he would imitate his\r\nbrother, and that care which he took of his countrymen, for whose\r\nliberty in general he died also; and that he would not permit the nation\r\nto be without a governor, especially in those destructive circumstances\r\nwherein it now was. And where Jonathan said that he was ready to die for\r\nthem, and esteemed no inferior to his brother, he was appointed to be\r\nthe general of the Jewish army.\r\n\r\n2. When Bacchides heard this, and was afraid that Jonathan might be very\r\ntroublesome to the king and the Macedonians, as Judas had been before\r\nhim, he sought how he might slay him by treachery. But this intention of\r\nhis was not unknown to Jonathan, nor to his brother Simon; but when\r\nthese two were apprized of it, they took all their companions, and\r\npresently fled into that wilderness which was nearest to the city; and\r\nwhen they were come to a lake called Asphar, they abode there. But when\r\nBacchides was sensible that they were in a low state, and were in that\r\nplace, he hasted to fall upon them with all his forces, and pitching his\r\ncamp beyond Jordan, he recruited his army. But when Jonathan knew that\r\nBacchides Was coming upon him, he sent his brother John, who was also\r\ncalled Gaddis, to the Nabatean Arabs, that he might lodge his baggage\r\nwith them until the battle with Bacchides should be over, for they were\r\nthe Jews' friends. And the sons of Ambri laid an ambush for John from\r\nthe city Medaba, and seized upon him, and upon those that were with him,\r\nand plundered all that they had with them. They also slew John, and all\r\nhis companions. However, they were sufficiently punished for what they\r\nnow did by John's brethren, as we shall relate presently.\r\n\r\n3. But when Bacchides knew that Jonathan had pitched his camp among the\r\nlakes of Jordan, he observed when their sabbath day came, and then\r\nassaulted him, [as supposing that he would not fight because of the law\r\nfor resting on that day]: but he exhorted his companions [to fight]; and\r\ntold them that their lives were at stake, since they were encompassed by\r\nthe river, and by their enemies, and had no way to escape, for that\r\ntheir enemies pressed upon them from before, and the river was behind\r\nthem. So after he had prayed to God to give them the victory, he joined\r\nbattle with the enemy, of whom he overthrew many; and as he saw\r\nBacchides coming up boldly to him, he stretched out his right hand to\r\nsmite him; but the other foreseeing and avoiding the stroke, Jonathan\r\nwith his companions leaped into the river, and swam over it, and by that\r\nmeans escaped beyond Jordan while the enemies did not pass over that\r\nriver; but Bacchides returned presently to the citadel at Jerusalem,\r\nhaving lost about two thousand of his army. He also fortified many\r\ncities of Judea, whose walls had been demolished; Jericho, and Emmaus,\r\nand Betboron, and Bethel, and Tinma, and Pharatho, and Tecoa, and\r\nGazara, and built towers in every one of these cities, and encompassed\r\nthem with strong walls, that were very large also, and put garrisons\r\ninto them, that they might issue out of them, and do mischief to the\r\nJews. He also fortified the citadel at Jerusalem more than all the rest.\r\nMoreover, he took the sons of the principal Jews as pledges, and shut\r\nthem up in the citadel, and in that manner guarded it.\r\n\r\n4. About the same time one came to Jonathan, and to his brother Simon,\r\nand told them that the sons of Ambri were celebrating a marriage, and\r\nbringing the bride from the city Gabatha, who was the daughter of one of\r\nthe illustrious men among the Arabians, and that the damsel was to be\r\nconducted with pomp, and splendor, and much riches: so Jonathan and\r\nSimon thinking this appeared to be the fittest time for them to avenge\r\nthe death of their brother, and that they had forces sufficient for\r\nreceiving satisfaction from them for his death, they made haste to\r\nMedaba, and lay in wait among the mountains for the coming of their\r\nenemies; and as soon as they saw them conducting the virgin, and her\r\nbridegroom, and such a great company of their friends with them as was\r\nto be expected at this wedding, they sallied out of their ambush, and\r\nslew them all, and took their ornaments, and all the prey that then\r\nfollowed them, and so returned, and received this satisfaction for their\r\nbrother John from the sons of Ambri; for as well those sons themselves,\r\nas their friends, and wives, and children that followed them, perished,\r\nbeing in number about four hundred.\r\n\r\n5. However, Simon and Jonathan returned to the lakes of the river, and\r\nabode there. But Bacchides, when he had secured all Judea with his\r\ngarrisons, returned to the king; and then it was that the affairs of\r\nJudea were quiet for two years. But when the deserters and the wicked\r\nsaw that Jonathan and those that were with him lived in the country very\r\nquietly, by reason of the peace, they sent to king Demetrius, and\r\nexcited him to send Bacchides to seize upon Jonathan, which they said\r\nwas to be done without any trouble, and in one night's time; and that if\r\nthey fell upon them before they were aware, they might slay them all. So\r\nthe king sent Bacchides, who, when he was come into Judea, wrote to all\r\nhis friends, both Jews and auxiliaries, that they should seize upon\r\nJonathan, and bring him to him; and when, upon all their endeavors, they\r\nwere not able to seize upon Jonathan, for he was sensible of the snares\r\nthey laid for him, and very carefully guarded against them, Bacchides\r\nwas angry at these deserters, as having imposed upon him, and upon the\r\nking, and slew fifty of their leaders: whereupon Jonathan, with his\r\nbrother, and those that were with him, retired to Bethagla, a village\r\nthat lay in the wilderness, out of his fear of Bacchides. He also built\r\ntowers in it, and encompassed it with walls, and took care that it\r\nshould be safely guarded. Upon the hearing of which Bacchides led his\r\nown army along with him, and besides took his Jewish auxiliaries, and\r\ncame against Jonathan, and made an assault upon his fortifications, and\r\nbesieged him many days; but Jonathan did not abate of his courage at the\r\nzeal Bacchides used in the siege, but courageously opposed him. And\r\nwhile he left his brother Simon in the city to fight with Bacchides, he\r\nwent privately out himself into the country, and got a great body of men\r\ntogether of his own party, and fell upon Bacchides's camp in the night\r\ntime, and destroyed a great many of them. His brother Simon knew also of\r\nthis his falling upon them, because he perceived that the enemies were\r\nslain by him; so he sallied out upon them, and burnt the engines which\r\nthe Macedonians used, and made a great slaughter of them. And when\r\nBacchides saw himself encompassed with enemies, and some of them before\r\nand some behind him, he fell into despair and trouble of mind, as\r\nconfounded at the unexpected ill success of this siege. However, he\r\nvented his displeasure at these misfortunes upon those deserters who\r\nsent for him from the king, as having deluded him. So he had a mind to\r\nfinish this siege after a decent manner, if it were possible for him so\r\nto do, and then to return home.\r\n\r\n6. When Jonathan understood these his intentions, he sent ambassadors to\r\nhim about a league of friendship and mutual assistance, and that they\r\nmight restore those they had taken captive on both sides. So Bacchides\r\nthought this a pretty decent way of retiring home, and made a league of\r\nfriendship with Jonathan, when they sware that they would not any more\r\nmake war one against another. Accordingly, he restored the captives, and\r\ntook his own men with him, and returned to the king at Antioch; and\r\nafter this his departure, he never came into Judea again. Then did\r\nJonathan take the opportunity of this quiet state of things, and went\r\nand lived in the city Michmash; and there governed the multitude, and\r\npunished the wicked and ungodly, and by that means purged the nation of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How Alexander [Bala] In His War With Demetrius, Granted\r\nJonathan Many Advantages And Appointed Him To Be High Priest And\r\nPersuaded Him To Assist Him Although Demetrius Promised Him Greater\r\nAdvantages On The Other Side. Concerning The Death\r\n\r\nOf Demetrius.\r\n\r\n1. Now in the hundred and sixtieth year, it fell out that Alexander, the\r\nson of Antiochus Epiphanes, 1 came up into Syria, and took Ptolemais the\r\nsoldiers within having betrayed it to him; for they were at enmity with\r\nDemetrius, on account of his insolence and difficulty of access; for he\r\nshut himself up in a palace of his that had four towers which he had\r\nbuilt himself, not far from Antioch and admitted nobody. He was withal\r\nslothful and negligent about the public affairs, whereby the hatred of\r\nhis subjects was the more kindled against him, as we have elsewhere\r\nalready related. When therefore Demetrius heard that Alexander was in\r\nPtolemais, he took his whole army, and led it against him; he also sent\r\nambassadors to Jonathan about a league of mutual assistance and\r\nfriendship, for he resolved to be beforehand with Alexander, lest the\r\nother should treat with him first, and gain assistance from him; and\r\nthis he did out of the fear he had lest Jonathan should remember how ill\r\nDemetrius had formerly treated him, and should join with him in this war\r\nagainst him. He therefore gave orders that Jonathan should be allowed to\r\nraise an army, and should get armor made, and should receive back those\r\nhostages of the Jewish nation whom Baechides had shut up in the citadel\r\nof Jerusalem. When this good fortune had befallen Jonathan, by the\r\nconcession of Demetrius, he came to Jerusalem, and read the king's\r\nletter in the audience of the people, and of those that kept the\r\ncitadel. When these were read, these wicked men and deserters, who were\r\nin the citadel, were greatly afraid, upon the king's permission to\r\nJonathan to raise an army, and to receive back the hostages. So he\r\ndelivered every one of them to his own parents. And thus did Jonathan\r\nmake his abode at Jerusalem, renewing the city to a better state, and\r\nreforming the buildings as he pleased; for he gave orders that the walls\r\nof the city should be rebuilt with square stones, that it might be more\r\nsecure from their enemies. And when those that kept the garrisons that\r\nwere in Judea saw this, they all left them, and fled to Antioch,\r\nexcepting those that were in the city Bethsura, and those that were in\r\nthe citadel of Jerusalem, for the greater part of these was of the\r\nwicked Jews and deserters, and on that account these did not deliver up\r\ntheir garrisons.\r\n\r\n2. When Alexander knew what promises Demetrius had made Jonathan, and\r\nwithal knew his courage, and what great things he had done when he\r\nfought the Macedonians, and besides what hardships he had undergone by\r\nthe means of Demetrius, and of Bacchides, the general of Demetrius's\r\narmy, he told his friends that he could not at present find any one else\r\nthat might afford him better assistance than Jonathan, who was both\r\ncourageous against his enemies, and had a particular hatred against\r\nDemetrius, as having both suffered many hard things from him, and acted\r\nmany hard things against him. If therefore they were of opinion that\r\nthey should make him their friend against Demetrius, it was more for\r\ntheir advantage to invite him to assist them now than at another time.\r\nIt being therefore determined by him and his friends to send to\r\nJonathan, he wrote to him this epistle: \"King Alexander to his brother\r\nJonathan, sendeth greeting. We have long ago heard of thy courage and\r\nthy fidelity, and for that reason have sent to thee, to make with thee a\r\nleague of friendship and mutual assistance. We therefore do ordain thee\r\nthis day the high priest of the Jews, and that thou beest called my\r\nfriend. I have also sent thee, as presents, a purple robe and a golden\r\ncrown, and desire that, now thou art by us honored, thou wilt in like\r\nmanner respect us also.\"\r\n\r\n3. When Jonathan had received this letter, he put on the pontifical robe\r\nat the time of the feast of tabernacles, 2 four years after the death of\r\nhis brother Judas, for at that time no high priest had been made. So he\r\nraised great forces, and had abundance of armor got ready. This greatly\r\ngrieved Demetrius when he heard of it, and made him blame himself for\r\nhis slowness, that he had not prevented Alexander, and got the good-will\r\nof Jonathan, but had given him time so to do. However, he also himself\r\nwrote a letter to Jonathan, and to the people, the contents whereof are\r\nthese: \"King Demetrius to Jonathan, and to the nation of the Jews,\r\nsendeth greeting. Since you have preserved your friendship for us, and\r\nwhen you have been tempted by our enemies, you have not joined\r\nyourselves to them, I both commend you for this your fidelity, and\r\nexhort you to continue in the same disposition, for which you shall be\r\nrepaid, and receive rewards from us; for I will free you from the\r\ngreatest part of the tributes and taxes which you formerly paid to the\r\nkings my predecessors, and to myself; and I do now set you free from\r\nthose tributes which you have ever paid; and besides, I forgive you the\r\ntax upon salt, and the value of the crowns which you used to offer to me\r\n3 and instead of the third part of the fruits [of the field], and the\r\nhalf of the fruits of the trees, I relinquish my part of them from this\r\nday: and as to the poll-money, which ought to be given me for every head\r\nof the inhabitants of Judea, and of the three toparchies that adjoin to\r\nJudea, Samaria, and Galilee, and Peres, that I relinquish to you for\r\nthis time, and for all time to come. I will also that the city of\r\nJerusalem be holy and inviolable, and free from the tithe, and from the\r\ntaxes, unto its utmost bounds. And I so far recede from my title to the\r\ncitadel, as to permit Jonathan your high priest to possess it, that he\r\nmay place such a garrison in it as he approves of for fidelity and good-\r\nwill to himself, that they may keep it for us. I also make free all\r\nthose Jews who have been made captives and slaves in my kingdom. I also\r\ngive order that the beasts of the Jews be not pressed for our service;\r\nand let their sabbaths, and all their festivals, and three days before\r\neach of them, be free from any imposition. In the same manner, I set\r\nfree the Jews that are inhabitants of my kingdom, and order that no\r\ninjury be done them. I also give leave to such of them as are willing to\r\nlist themselves in my army, that they may do it, and those as far as\r\nthirty thousand; which Jewish soldiers, wheresoever they go, shall have\r\nthe same pay that my own army hath; and some of them I will place in my\r\ngarrisons, and some as guards about mine own body, and as rulers over\r\nthose that are in my court. I give them leave also to use the laws of\r\ntheir forefathers, and to observe them; and I will that they have power\r\nover the three toparchies that are added to Judea; and it shall be in\r\nthe power of the high priest to take care that no one Jew shall have any\r\nother temple for worship but only that at Jerusalem. I bequeath also,\r\nout of my own revenues, yearly, for the expenses about the sacrifices,\r\none hundred and fifty thousand [drachmae]; and what money is to spare, I\r\nwill that it shall be your own. I also release to you those ten thousand\r\ndrachmae which the kings received from the temple, because they\r\nappertain to the priests that minister in that temple. And whosoever\r\nshall fly to the temple at Jerusalem, or to the places thereto\r\nbelonging, or who owe the king money, or are there on any other account,\r\nlet them be set free, and let their goods be in safety. I also give you\r\nleave to repair and rebuild your temple, and that all be done at my\r\nexpenses. I also allow you to build the walls of your city, and to erect\r\nhigh towers, and that they be erected at my charge. And if there be any\r\nfortified town that would be convenient for the Jewish country to have\r\nvery strong, let it be so built at my expenses.\"\r\n\r\n4. This was what Demetrius promised and granted to the Jews by this\r\nletter. But king Alexander raised a great army of mercenary soldiers,\r\nand of those that deserted to him out of Syria, and made an expedition\r\nagainst Demetrius. And when it was come to a battle, the left wing of\r\nDemetrius put those who opposed them to flight, and pursued them a great\r\nway, and slew many of them, and spoiled their camp; but the right wing,\r\nwhere Demetrius happened to be, was beaten; and as for all the rest,\r\nthey ran away. But Demetrius fought courageously, and slew a great many\r\nof the enemy; but as he was in the pursuit of the rest, his horse\r\ncarried him into a deep bog, where it was hard to get out, and there it\r\nhappened, that upon his horse's falling down, he could not escape being\r\nkilled; for when his enemies saw what had befallen him, they returned\r\nback, and encompassed Demetrius round, and they all threw their darts at\r\nhim; but he, being now on foot, fought bravely. But at length he\r\nreceived so many wounds, that he was not able to bear up any longer, but\r\nfell. And this is the end that Demetrius came to, when he had reigned\r\neleven years, 4 as we have elsewhere related.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. The Friendship That Was Between Onias And Ptolemy Philometor;\r\nAnd How Onias Built A Temple In Egypt Like To That At Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1. But then the son of Onias the high priest, who was of the same name\r\nwith his father, and who fled to king Ptolemy, who was called\r\nPhilometor, lived now at Alexandria, as we have said already. When this\r\nOnias saw that Judea was oppressed by the Macedonians and their kings,\r\nout of a desire to purchase to himself a memorial and eternal fame he\r\nresolved to send to king Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra, to ask leave of\r\nthem that he might build a temple in Egypt like to that at Jerusalem,\r\nand might ordain Levites and priests out of their own stock. The chief\r\nreason why he was desirous so to do, was, that he relied upon the\r\nprophet Isaiah, who lived above six hundred years before, and foretold\r\nthat there certainly was to be a temple built to Almighty God in Egypt\r\nby a man that was a Jew. Onias was elevated with this prediction, and\r\nwrote the following epistle to Ptolemy and Cleopatra: \"Having done many\r\nand great things for you in the affairs of the war, by the assistance of\r\nGod, and that in Celesyria and Phoenicia, I came at length with the Jews\r\nto Leontopolis, and to other places of your nation, where I found that\r\nthe greatest part of your people had temples in an improper manner, and\r\nthat on this account they bare ill-will one against another, which\r\nhappens to the Egyptians by reason of the multitude of their temples,\r\nand the difference of opinions about Divine worship. Now I found a very\r\nfit place in a castle that hath its name from the country Diana; this\r\nplace is full of materials of several sorts, and replenished with sacred\r\nanimals; I desire therefore that you will grant me leave to purge this\r\nholy place, which belongs to no master, and is fallen down, and to build\r\nthere a temple to Almighty God, after the pattern of that in Jerusalem,\r\nand of the same dimensions, that may be for the benefit of thyself, and\r\nthy wife and children, that those Jews which dwell in Egypt may have a\r\nplace whither they may come and meet together in mutual harmony one with\r\nanother, and he subservient to thy advantages; for the prophet Isaiah\r\nforetold that, 'there should be an altar in Egypt to the Lord God;'\" 5\r\nand many other such things did he prophesy relating to that place.\r\n\r\n2. And this was what Onias wrote to king Ptolemy. Now any one may\r\nobserve his piety, and that of his sister and wife Cleopatra, by that\r\nepistle which they wrote in answer to it; for they laid the blame and\r\nthe transgression of the law upon the head of Onias. And this was their\r\nreply: \"King Ptolemy and queen Cleopatra to Onias, send greeting. We\r\nhave read thy petition, wherein thou desirest leave to be given thee to\r\npurge that temple which is fallen down at Leontopolis, in the Nomus of\r\nHeliopolis, and which is named from the country Bubastis; on which\r\naccount we cannot but wonder that it should be pleasing to God to have a\r\ntemple erected in a place so unclean, and so full of sacred animals. But\r\nsince thou sayest that Isaiah the prophet foretold this long ago, we\r\ngive thee leave to do it, if it may be done according to your law, and\r\nso that we may not appear to have at all offended God herein.\"\r\n\r\n3. So Onias took the place, and built a temple, and an altar to God,\r\nlike indeed to that in Jerusalem, but smaller and poorer. I do not think\r\nit proper for me now to describe its dimensions or its vessels, which\r\nhave been already described in my seventh book of the Wars of the Jews.\r\nHowever, Onias found other Jews like to himself, together with priests\r\nand Levites, that there performed Divine service. But we have said\r\nenough about this temple.\r\n\r\n4. Now it came to pass that the Alexandrian Jews, and those Samaritans\r\nwho paid their worship to the temple that was built in the days of\r\nAlexander at Mount Gerizzim, did now make a sedition one against\r\nanother, and disputed about their temples before Ptolemy himself; the\r\nJews saying that, according to the laws of Moses, the temple was to be\r\nbuilt at Jerusalem; and the Samaritans saying that it was to be built at\r\nGerizzim. They desired therefore the king to sit with his friends, and\r\nhear the debates about these matters, and punish those with death who\r\nwere baffled. Now Sabbeus and Theodosius managed the argument for the\r\nSamaritans, and Andronicus, the son of Messalamus, for the people of\r\nJerusalem; and they took an oath by God and the king to make their\r\ndemonstrations according to the law; and they desired of Ptolemy, that\r\nwhomsoever he should find that transgressed what they had sworn to, he\r\nwould put him to death. Accordingly, the king took several of his\r\nfriends into the council, and sat down, in order to hear what the\r\npleaders said. Now the Jews that were at Alexandria were in great\r\nconcern for those men, whose lot it was to contend for the temple at\r\nJerusalem; for they took it very ill that any should take away the\r\nreputation of that temple, which was so ancient and so celebrated all\r\nover the habitable earth. Now when Sabbeus and Theodosius had given\r\nleave to Andronicus to speak first, he began to demonstrate out of the\r\nlaw, and out of the successions of the high priests, how they every one\r\nin succession from his father had received that dignity, and ruled over\r\nthe temple; and how all the kings of Asia had honored that temple with\r\ntheir donations, and with the most splendid gifts dedicated thereto. But\r\nas for that at Gerizzm, he made no account of it, and regarded it as if\r\nit had never had a being. By this speech, and other arguments,\r\nAndronicus persuaded the king to determine that the temple at Jerusalem\r\nwas built according to the laws of Moses, 6 and to put Sabbeus and\r\nTheodosius to death. And these were the events that befell the Jews at\r\nAlexandria in the days of Ptolemy Philometor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How Alexander Honored Jonathan After An Extraordinary Manner;\r\nAnd How Demetrius, The Son Of Demetrius, Overcame Alexander And Made A\r\nLeague Of Friendship With Jonathan.\r\n\r\n1. Demetrius being thus slain in battle, as we have above related,\r\nAlexander took the kingdom of Syria; and wrote to Ptolemy Philometor,\r\nand desired his daughter in marriage; and said it was but just that he\r\nshould be joined an affinity to one that had now received the\r\nprincipality of his forefathers, and had been promoted to it by God's\r\nprovidence, and had conquered Demetrius, and that was on other accounts\r\nnot unworthy of being related to him. Ptolemy received this proposal of\r\nmarriage gladly; and wrote him an answer, saluting him on account of his\r\nhaving received the principality of his forefathers; and promising him\r\nthat he would give him his daughter in marriage; and assured him that he\r\nwas coming to meet him at Ptolemais, and desired that he would there\r\nmeet him, for that he would accompany her from Egypt so far, and would\r\nthere marry his child to him. When Ptolemy had written thus, he came\r\nsuddenly to Ptolemais, and brought his daughter Cleopatra along with\r\nhim; and as he found Alexander there before him, as he desired him to\r\ncome, he gave him his child in marriage, and for her portion gave her as\r\nmuch silver and gold as became such a king to give.\r\n\r\n2. When the wedding was over, Alexander wrote to Jonathan the high\r\npriest, and desired him to come to Ptolemais. So when he came to these\r\nkings, and had made them magnificent presents, he was honored by them\r\nboth. Alexander compelled him also to put off his own garment, and to\r\ntake a purple garment, and made him sit with him in his throne; and\r\ncommanded his captains that they should go with him into the middle of\r\nthe city, and proclaim, that it was not permitted to any one to speak\r\nagainst him, or to give him any disturbance. And when the captains had\r\nthus done, those that were prepared to accuse Jonathan, and who bore him\r\nill-will, when they saw the honor that was done him by proclamation, and\r\nthat by the king's order, ran away, and were afraid lest some mischief\r\nshould befall them. Nay, king Alexander was so very kind to Jonathan,\r\nthat he set him down as the principal of his friends.\r\n\r\n3. But then, upon the hundred and sixty-fifth year, Demetrius, the son\r\nof Demetrius, came from Crete with a great number of mercenary soldiers,\r\nwhich Lasthenes, the Cretian, brought him, and sailed to Cilicia. This\r\nthing cast Alexander into great concern and disorder when he heard it;\r\nso he made haste immediately out of Phoenicia, and came to Antioch, that\r\nhe might put matters in a safe posture there before Demetrius should\r\ncome. He also left Apollonius Daus 7 governor of Celesyria, who coming\r\nto Jamnia with a great army, sent to Jonathan the high priest, and told\r\nhim that it was not right that he alone should live at rest, and with\r\nauthority, and not be subject to the king; that this thing had made him\r\na reproach among all men, that he had not yet made him subject to the\r\nking. \"Do not thou therefore deceive thyself, and sit still among the\r\nmountains, and pretend to have forces with thee; but if thou hast any\r\ndependence on thy strength, come down into the plain, and let our armies\r\nbe compared together, and the event of the battle will demonstrate which\r\nof us is the most courageous. However, take notice, that the most\r\nvaliant men of every city are in my army, and that these are the very\r\nmen who have always beaten thy progenitors; but let us have the battle\r\nin such a place of the country where we may fight with weapons, and not\r\nwith stones, and where there may be no place whither those that are\r\nbeaten may fly.\"\r\n\r\n4. With this Jonathan was irritated; and choosing himself out ten\r\nthousand of his soldiers, he went out of Jerusalem in haste, with his\r\nbrother Simon, and came to Joppa, and pitched his camp on the outside of\r\nthe city, because the people of Joppa had shut their gates against him,\r\nfor they had a garrison in the city put there by Apollonius. But when\r\nJonathan was preparing to besiege them, they were afraid he would take\r\nthem by force, and so they opened the gates to him. But Apollonius, when\r\nhe heard that Joppa was taken by Jonathan, took three thousand horsemen,\r\nand eight thousand footmen and came to Ashdod; and removing thence, he\r\nmade his journey silently and slowly, and going up to Joppa, he made as\r\nif he was retiring from the place, and so drew Jonathan into the plain,\r\nas valuing himself highly upon his horsemen, and having his hopes of\r\nvictory principally in them. However, Jonathan sallied out, and pursued\r\nApollonius to Ashdod; but as soon as Apollonius perceived that his enemy\r\nwas in the plain, he came back and gave him battle. But Apollonius had\r\nlaid a thousand horsemen in ambush in a valley, that they might be seen\r\nby their enemies as behind them; which when Jonathan perceived, he was\r\nunder no consternation, but ordering his army to stand in a square\r\nbattle-array, he gave them a charge to fall on the enemy on both sides,\r\nand set them to face those that attacked them both before and behind;\r\nand while the fight lasted till the evening, he gave part of his forces\r\nto his brother Simon, and ordered him to attack the enemies; but for\r\nhimself, he charged those that were with him to cover themselves with\r\ntheir armor, and receive the darts of the horsemen, who did as they were\r\ncommanded; so that the enemy's horsemen, while they threw their darts\r\ntill they had no more left, did them no harm, for the darts that were\r\nthrown did not enter into their bodies, being thrown upon the shields\r\nthat were united and conjoined together, the closeness of which easily\r\novercame the force of the darts, and they flew about without any effect.\r\nBut when the enemy grew remiss in throwing their darts from morning till\r\nlate at night, Simon perceived their weariness, and fell upon the body\r\nof men before him; and because his soldiers showed great alacrity, he\r\nput the enemy to flight. And when the horsemen saw that the footmen ran\r\naway, neither did they stay themselves, but they being very weary, by\r\nthe duration of the fight till the evening, and their hope from the\r\nfootmen being quite gone, they basely ran away, and in great confusion\r\nalso, till they were separated one from another, and scattered over all\r\nthe plain. Upon which Jonathan pursued them as far as Ashdod, and slew a\r\ngreat many of them, and compelled the rest, in despair of escaping, to\r\nfly to the temple of Dagon, which was at Ashdod; but Jonathan took the\r\ncity on the first onset, and burnt it, and the villages about it; nor\r\ndid he abstain from the temple of Dagon itself, but burnt it also, and\r\ndestroyed those that had fled to it. Now the entire multitude of the\r\nenemies that fell in the battle, and were consumed in the temple, were\r\neight thousand. When Jonathan therefore had overcome so great an army,\r\nhe removed from Ashdod, and came to Askelon; and when he had pitched his\r\ncamp without the city, the people of Askelon came out and met him,\r\nbringing him hospitable presents, and honoring him; so he accepted of\r\ntheir kind intentions, and returned thence to Jerusalem with a great\r\ndeal of prey, which he brought thence when he conquered his enemies. But\r\nwhen Alexander heard that Apollonius, the general of his army, was\r\nbeaten, he pretended to be glad of it, because he had fought with\r\nJonathan his friend and ally against his directions. Accordingly, he\r\nsent to Jonathan, and gave testimony to his worth; and gave him honorary\r\nrewards, as a golden button, 8 which it is the custom to give the king's\r\nkinsmen, and allowed him Ekron and its toparchy for his own inheritance.\r\n\r\n5. About this time it was that king Ptolemy, who was called Philometor,\r\nled an army, part by the sea, and part by land, and came to Syria, to\r\nthe assistance of Alexander, who was his son-in-law; and accordingly all\r\nthe cities received him willingly, as Alexander had commanded them to\r\ndo, and conducted him as far as Ashdod; where they all made loud\r\ncomplaints about the temple of Dagon, which was burnt, and accused\r\nJonathan of having laid it waste, and destroyed the country adjoining\r\nwith fire, and slain a great number of them. Ptolemy heard these\r\naccusations, but said nothing. Jonathan also went to meet Ptolemy as far\r\nas Joppa, and obtained from him hospitable presents, and those glorious\r\nin their kinds, with all the marks of honor; and when he had conducted\r\nhim as far as the river called Eleutherus, he returned again to\r\nJerusalem.\r\n\r\n6. But as Ptolemy was at Ptolemais, he was very near to a most\r\nunexpected destruction; for a treacherous design was laid for his life\r\nby Alexander, by the means of Ammonius, who was his friend; and as the\r\ntreachery was very plain, Ptolemy wrote to Alexander, and required of\r\nhim that he should bring Ammonius to condign punishment, informing him\r\nwhat snares had been laid for him by Ammonius, and desiring that he\r\nmight be accordingly punished for it. But when Alexander did not comply\r\nwith his demands, he perceived that it was he himself who laid the\r\ndesign, and was very angry at him. Alexander had also formerly been on\r\nvery ill terms with the people of Antioch, for they had suffered very\r\nmuch by his means; yet did Ammonius at length undergo the punishment his\r\ninsolent crimes had deserved, for he was killed in an opprobrious\r\nmanner, like a woman, while he endeavored to conceal himself in a\r\nfeminine habit, as we have elsewhere related.\r\n\r\n7. Hereupon Ptolemy blamed himself for having given his daughter in\r\nmarriage to Alexander, and for the league he had made with him to assist\r\nhim against Demetrius; so he dissolved his relation to him, and took his\r\ndaughter away from him, and immediately sent to Demetrius, and offered\r\nto make a league of mutual assistance and friendship with him, and\r\nagreed with him to give him his daughter in marriage, and to restore him\r\nto the principality of his fathers. Demetrius was well pleased with this\r\nembassage, and accepted of his assistance, and of the marriage of his\r\ndaughter. But Ptolemy had still one more hard task to do, and that was\r\nto persuade the people of Antioch to receive Demetrius, because they\r\nwere greatly displeased at him, on account of the injuries his father\r\nDemetrius had done them; yet did he bring this about; for as the people\r\nof Antioch hated Alexander on Ammonius's account, as we have shown\r\nalready, they were easily prevailed with to cast him out of Antioch;\r\nwho, thus expelled out of Antioch, came into Cilicia. Ptolemy came then\r\nto Antioch, and was made king by its inhabitants, and by the army; so\r\nthat he was forced to put on two diadems, the one of Asia, the other of\r\nEgypt: but being naturally a good and a righteous man, and not desirous\r\nof what belonged to others, and besides these dispositions, being also a\r\nwise man in reasoning about futurities, he determined to avoid the envy\r\nof the Romans; so he called the people of Antioch together to an\r\nassembly, and persuaded them to receive Demetrius; and assured them that\r\nhe would not be mindful of what they did to his father in case he should\r\nbe now obliged by them; and he undertook that he would himself be a good\r\nmonitor and governor to him, and promised that he would not permit him\r\nto attempt any bad actions; but that, for his own part, he was contented\r\nwith the kingdom of Egypt. By which discourse he persuaded the people of\r\nAntioch to receive Demetrius.\r\n\r\n8. But now Alexander made haste with a numerous and great army, and came\r\nout of Cilicia into Syria, and burnt the country belonging to Antioch,\r\nand pillaged it; whereupon Ptolemy, and his son-in-law Demetrius,\r\nbrought their army against him, [for he had already given him his\r\ndaughter in marriage,] and beat Alexander, and put him to flight; and\r\naccordingly he fled into Arabia. Now it happened in the time of the\r\nbattle that Ptolemy' horse, upon hearing the noise of an elephant, cast\r\nhim off his back, and threw him on the ground; upon the sight of which\r\naccident, his enemies fell upon him, and gave him many wounds upon his\r\nhead, and brought him into danger of death; for when his guards caught\r\nhim up, he was so very ill, that for four days' time he was not able\r\neither to understand or to speak. However, Zabdiel, a prince among the\r\nArabians, cut off Alexander's head, and sent it to Ptolemy, who\r\nrecovering of his wounds, and returning to his understanding, on the\r\nfifth day, heard at once a most agreeable hearing, and saw a most\r\nagreeable sight, which were the death and the head of Alexander; yet a\r\nlittle after this his joy for the death of Alexander, with which he was\r\nso greatly satisfied, he also departed this life. Now Alexander, who was\r\ncalled Balas, reigned over Asia five years, as we have elsewhere\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\n9. But when Demetrius, who was styled Nicator, 9 had taken the kingdom,\r\nhe was so wicked as to treat Ptolemy's soldiers very hardly, neither\r\nremembering the league of mutual assistance that was between them, nor\r\nthat he was his son-in-law and kinsman, by Cleopatra's marriage to him;\r\nso the soldiers fled from his wicked treatment to Alexandria; but\r\nDemetrius kept his elephants. But Jonathan the high priest levied an\r\narmy out of all Judea, and attacked the citadel at Jerusalem, and\r\nbesieged it. It was held by a garrison of Macedonians, and by some of\r\nthose wicked men who had deserted the customs of their forefathers.\r\nThese men at first despised the attempts of Jonathan for taking the\r\nplace, as depending on its strength; but some of those wicked men went\r\nout by night, and came to Demetrius, and informed him that the citadel\r\nwas besieged; who was irritated with what he heard, and took his army,\r\nand came from Antioch, against Jonathan. And when he was at Antioch, he\r\nwrote to him, and commanded him to come to him quickly to Ptolemais:\r\nupon which Jonathan did not intermit the siege of the citadel, but took\r\nwith him the elders of the people, and the priests, and carried with him\r\ngold, and silver, and garments, and a great number of presents of\r\nfriendship, and came to Demetrius, and presented him with them, and\r\nthereby pacified the king's anger. So he was honored by him, and\r\nreceived from him the confirmation of his high priesthood, as he had\r\npossessed it by the grants of the kings his predecessors. And when the\r\nJewish deserters accused him, Demetrius was so far from giving credit to\r\nthem, that when he petitioned him that he would demand no more than\r\nthree hundred talents for the tribute of all Judea, and the three\r\ntoparchies of Samaria, and Perea, and Galilee, he complied with the\r\nproposal, and gave him a letter confirming all those grants; whose\r\ncontents were as follows: \"King Demetrius to Jonathan his brother, and\r\nto the nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting. We have sent you a copy of\r\nthat epistle which we have written to Lasthones our kinsman, that you\r\nmay know its contents. 'King Demetrus to Lasthenes our father, sendeth\r\ngreeting. I have determined to return thanks, and to show favor to the\r\nnation of the Jews, which hath observed the rules of justice in our\r\nconcerns. Accordingly, I remit to them the three prefectures, Apherims,\r\nand Lydda, and Ramatha, which have been added to Judea out of Samaria,\r\nwith their appurtenances; as also what the kings my predecessors\r\nreceived from those that offered sacrifices in Jerusalem, and what are\r\ndue from the fruits of the earth, and of the trees, and what else\r\nbelongs to us; with the salt-pits, and the crowns that used to be\r\npresented to us. Nor shall they be compelled to pay any of those taxes\r\nfrom this time to all futurity. Take care therefore that a copy of this\r\nepistle be taken, and given to Jonathan, and be set up in an eminent\r\nplace of their holy temple.'\" And these were the contents of this\r\nwriting. And now when Demetrius saw that there was peace every where,\r\nand that there was no danger, nor fear of war, he disbanded the greatest\r\npart of his army, and diminished their pay, and even retained in pay no\r\nothers than such foreigners as came up with him from Crete, and from the\r\nother islands. However, this procured him ill-will and hatred from the\r\nsoldiers; on whom he bestowed nothing from this time, while the kings\r\nbefore him used to pay them in time of peace as they did before, that\r\nthey might have their good-will, and that they might be very ready to\r\nundergo the difficulties of war, if any occasion should require it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How Trypho After He Had Beaten Demetrius Delivered The\r\nKingdom To Antiochus The Son Of Alexander, And Gained Jonathan For His\r\nAssistant; And Concerning The Actions And Embassies Of Jonathan.\r\n\r\n1. Now there was a certain commander of Alexander's forces, an Apanemian\r\nby birth, whose name was Diodotus, and was also called Trypho, took\r\nnotice the ill-will of the soldiers bare to Demetrius, and went to\r\nMalchus the Arabian, who brought up Antiochus, the son of Alexander, and\r\ntold him what ill-will the army bare Demetrius, and persuaded him to\r\ngive him Antiochus, because he would make him king, and recover to him\r\nthe kingdom of his father. Malchus at the first opposed him in this\r\nattempt, because he could not believe him; but when Trypho lay hard at\r\nhim for a long time, he over-persuaded him to comply with Trypho's\r\nintentions and entreaties. And this was the state Trypho was now in.\r\n\r\n2. But Jonathan the high priest, being desirous to get clear of those\r\nthat were in the citadel of Jerusalem, and of the Jewish deserters, and\r\nwicked men, as well as of those in all the garrisons in the country,\r\nsent presents and ambassadors to Demetrius, and entreated him to take\r\naway his soldiers out of the strong holds of Judea. Demetrius made\r\nanswer, that after the war, which he was now deeply engaged in, was\r\nover, he would not only grant him that, but greater things than that\r\nalso; and he desired he would send him some assistance, and informed him\r\nthat his army had deserted him. So Jonathan chose out three thousand of\r\nhis soldiers, and sent them to Demetrius.\r\n\r\n3. Now the people of Antioch hated Demetrius, both on account of what\r\nmischief he had himself done them, and because they were his enemies\r\nalso on account of his father Demetrius, who had greatly abused them; so\r\nthey watched some opportunity which they might lay hold on to fall upon\r\nhim. And when they were informed of the assistance that was coming to\r\nDemetrius from Jonathan, and considered at the same time that he would\r\nraise a numerous army, unless they prevented him, and seized upon him,\r\nthey took their weapons immediately, and encompassed his palace in the\r\nway of a siege, and seizing upon all the ways of getting out, they\r\nsought to subdue their king. And when he saw that the people of Antioch\r\nwere become his bitter enemies and that they were thus in arms, he took\r\nthe mercenary soldiers which he had with them, and those Jews who were\r\nsent by Jonathan, and assaulted the Antiochians; but he was overpowered\r\nby them, for they were many ten thousands, and was beaten. But when the\r\nJews saw that the Antiochians were superior, they went up to the top of\r\nthe palace, and shot at them from thence; and because they were so\r\nremote from them by their height, that they suffered nothing on their\r\nside, but did great execution on the others, as fighting from such an\r\nelevation, they drove them out of the adjoining houses, and immediately\r\nset them on fire, whereupon the flame spread itself over the whole city,\r\nand burnt it all down. This happened by reason of the closeness of the\r\nhouses, and because they were generally built of wood. So the\r\nAntiochians, when they were not able to help themselves, nor to stop the\r\nfire, were put to flight. And as the Jews leaped from the top of one\r\nhouse to the top of another, and pursued them after that manner, it\r\nthence happened that the pursuit was so very surprising. But when the\r\nking saw that the Antiochians were were busy in saving their children\r\nand their wives, and so did not fight any longer, he fell upon them in\r\nthe narrow passages, and fought them, and slew a great many of them,\r\ntill at last they were forced to throw down their arms, and to deliver\r\nthemselves up to Demetrius. So he forgave them this their insolent\r\nbehavior, and put an end to the sedition; and when he had given rewards\r\nto the Jews out of the rich spoils he had gotten, and had returned them\r\nthanks, as the cause of his victory, he sent them away to Jerusalem to\r\nJonathan, with an ample testimony of the assistance they had afforded\r\nhim. Yet did he prove an ill man to Jonathan afterward, and broke the\r\npromises he had made; and he threatened that he would make war upon him,\r\nunless he would pay all that tribute which the Jewish nation owed to the\r\nfirst kings [of Syria]. And this he had done, if Trypho had not hindered\r\nhim, and diverted his preparations against Jonathan to a concern for his\r\nown preservation; for he now returned out of Arabia into Syria, with the\r\nchild Antiochus, for he was yet in age but a youth, and put the diadem\r\non his head; and as the whole forces that had left Demetrius, because\r\nthey had no pay, came to his assistance, he made war upon Demetrius, and\r\njoining battle with him, overcame him in the fight, and took from him\r\nboth his elephants and the city Antioch.\r\n\r\n4. Demetrius, upon this defeat, retired into Cilicia; but the child\r\nAntiochus sent ambassadors and an epistle to Jonathan, and made him his\r\nfriend and confederate, and confirmed to him the high priesthood, and\r\nyielded up to him the four prefectures which had been added to Judea.\r\nMoreover, he sent him vessels and cups of gold, and a purple garment,\r\nand gave him leave to use them. He also presented him with a golden\r\nbutton, and styled him one of his principal friends, and appointed his\r\nbrother Simon to be the general over the forces, from the Ladder of Tyre\r\nunto Egypt. So Jonathan was so pleased with these grants made him by\r\nAntiochus, that he sent ambassadors to him and to Trypho, and professed\r\nhimself to be their friend and confederate, and said he would join with\r\nhim in a war against Demetrius, informing him that he had made no proper\r\nreturns for the kindness he had done him; for that when he had received\r\nmany marks of kindness from him, when he stood in great need of them,\r\nhe, for such good turns, had requited him with further injuries.\r\n\r\n5. So Antiochus gave Jonathan leave to raise himself a numerous army out\r\nof Syria and Phoenicia and to make war against Demetrius's generals;\r\nwhereupon he went in haste to the several cities which received him\r\nsplendidly indeed, but put no forces into his hands. And when he was\r\ncome from thence to Askelon, the inhabitants of Askelon came and brought\r\nhim presents, and met him in a splendid manner. He exhorted them, and\r\nevery one of the cities of Celesyria, to forsake Demetrius, and to join\r\nwith Antiochus; and, in assisting him, to endeavor to punish Demetrius\r\nfor what offenses he had been guilty of against themselves; and told\r\nthem there were many reasons for that their procedure, if they had a\r\nmind so to do. And when he had persuaded those cities to promise their\r\nassistance to Antiochus, he came to Gaza, in order to induce them also\r\nto be friends to Antiochus; but he found the inhabitants of Gaza much\r\nmore alienated from him than he expected, for they had shut their gates\r\nagainst him; and although they had deserted Demetrius, they had not\r\nresolved to join themselves to Antiochus. This provoked Jonathan to\r\nbesiege them, and to harass their country; for as he set a part of his\r\narmy round about Gaza itself, so with the rest he overran their land,\r\nand spoiled it, and burnt what was in it. When the people of Gaza saw\r\nthemselves in this state of affliction, and that no assistance came to\r\nthem from Demetrius, that what distressed them was at hand, but what\r\nshould profit them was still at a great distance, and it was uncertain\r\nwhether it would come at all or not, they thought it would be prudent\r\nconduct to leave off any longer continuance with them, and to cultivate\r\nfriendship with the other; so they sent to Jonathan, and professed they\r\nwould be his friends, and afford him assistance: for such is the temper\r\nof men, that before they have had the trial of great afflictions, they\r\ndo not understand what is for their advantage; but when they find\r\nthemselves under such afflictions, they then change their minds, and\r\nwhat it had been better for them to have done before they had been at\r\nall damaged, they choose to do, but not till after they have suffered\r\nsuch damages. However, he made a league of friendship with them, and\r\ntook from them hostages for their performance of it, and sent these\r\nhostages to Jerusalem, while he went himself over all the country, as\r\nfar as Damascus.\r\n\r\n6. But when he heard that the generals of Demetrius's forces were come\r\nto the city Cadesh with a numerous army, [the place lies between the\r\nland of the Tyrians and Galilee,]for they supposed they should hereby\r\ndraw him out of Syria, in order to preserve Galilee, and that he would\r\nnot overlook the Galileans, who were his own people, when war was made\r\nupon them, he went to meet them, having left Simon in Judea, who raised\r\nas great an army as he was able out of the country, and then sat down\r\nbefore Bethsura, and besieged it, that being the strongest place in all\r\nJudea; and a garrison of Demetrius's kept it, as we have already\r\nrelated. But as Simon was raising banks, and bringing his engines of war\r\nagainst Bethsura, and was very earnest about the siege of it, the\r\ngarrison was afraid lest the place should be taken of Simon by force,\r\nand they put to the sword; so they sent to Simon, and desired the\r\nsecurity of his oath, that they should come to no harm from him, and\r\nthat they would leave the place, and go away to Demetrius. Accordingly\r\nhe gave them his oath, and ejected them out of the city, and he put\r\ntherein a garrison of his own.\r\n\r\n7. But Jonathan removed out of Galilee, and from the waters which are\r\ncalled Gennesar, for there he was before encamped, and came into the\r\nplain that is called Asor, without knowing that the enemy was there.\r\nWhen therefore Demetrius's men knew a day beforehand that Jonathan was\r\ncoming against them, they laid an ambush in the mountain, who were to\r\nassault him on the sudden, while they themselves met him with an army in\r\nthe plain; which army, when Jonathan saw ready to engage him, he also\r\ngot ready his own soldiers for the battle as well as he was able; but\r\nthose that were laid in ambush by Demetrius's generals being behind\r\nthem, the Jews were afraid lest they should be caught in the midst\r\nbetween two bodies, and perish; so they ran away in haste, and indeed\r\nall the rest left Jonathan; but a few there were, in number about fifty,\r\nwho staid with him, and with them Mattathias, the son of Absalom, and\r\nJudas, the son of Chapseus, who were commanders of the whole army. These\r\nmarched boldly, and like men desperate, against the enemy, and so pushed\r\nthem, that by their courage they daunted them, and with their weapons in\r\ntheir hands they put them to flight. And when those soldiers of Jonathan\r\nthat had retired saw the enemy giving way, they got together after their\r\nflight, and pursued them with great violence; and this did they as far\r\nas Cadesh, where the camp of the enemy lay.\r\n\r\n8. Jonathan having thus gotten a glorious victory, and slain two\r\nthousand of the enemy, returned to Jerusalem. So when he saw that all\r\nhis affairs prospered according to his mind, by the providence of God,\r\nhe sent ambassadors to the Romans, being desirous of renewing that\r\nfriendship which their nation had with them formerly. He enjoined the\r\nsame ambassadors, that, as they came back, they should go to the\r\nSpartans, and put them in mind of their friendship and kindred. So when\r\nthe ambassadors came to Rome, they went into their senate, and said what\r\nthey were commanded by Jonathan the high priest to say, how he had sent\r\nthem to confirm their friendship. The senate then confirmed what had\r\nbeen formerly decreed concerning their friendship with the Jews, and\r\ngave them letters to carry to all the kings of Asia and Europe, and to\r\nthe governors of the cities, that they might safely conduct them to\r\ntheir own country. Accordingly, as they returned, they came to Sparta,\r\nand delivered the epistle which they had received of Jonathan to them; a\r\ncopy of which here follows: \"Jonathan the high priest of the Jewish\r\nnation, and the senate, and body of the people of the Jews, to the\r\nephori, and senate, and people of the Lacedemonians, send greeting. If\r\nyou be well, and both your public and private affairs be agreeable to\r\nyour mind, it is according to our wishes. We are well also. When in\r\nformer times an epistle was brought to Onias, who was then our high\r\npriest, from Areus, who at that time was your king, by Demoteles,\r\nconcerning the kindred that was between us and you, a copy of which is\r\nhere subjoined, we both joyfully received the epistle, and were well\r\npleased with Demoteles and Areus, although we did not need such a\r\ndemonstration, because we were satisfied about it from the sacred\r\nwritings 10 yet did not we think fit first to begin the claim of this\r\nrelation to you, lest we should seem too early in taking to ourselves\r\nthe glory which is now given us by you. It is a long time since this\r\nrelation of ours to you hath been renewed; and when we, upon holy and\r\nfestival days, offer sacrifices to God, we pray to him for your\r\npreservation and victory. As to ourselves, although we have had many\r\nwars that have compassed us around, by reason of the covetousness of our\r\nneighbors, yet did not we determine to be troublesome either to you, or\r\nto others that were related to us; but since we have now overcome our\r\nenemies, and have occasion to send Numenius the son of Antiochus, and\r\nAntipater the son of Jason, who are both honorable men belonging to our\r\nsenate, to the Romans, we gave them this epistle to you also, that they\r\nmight renew that friendship which is between us. You will therefore do\r\nwell yourselves to write to us, and send us an account of what you stand\r\nin need of from us, since we are in all things disposed to act according\r\nto your desires.\" So the Lacedemonians received the ambassadors kindly,\r\nand made a decree for friendship and mutual assistance, and sent it to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n9. At this time there were three sects among the Jews, who had different\r\nopinions concerning human actions; the one was called the sect of the\r\nPharisees, another the sect of the Sadducees, and the other the sect of\r\nthe Essens. Now for the Pharisees, 11 they say that some actions, but\r\nnot all, are the work of fate, and some of them are in our own power,\r\nand that they are liable to fate, but are not caused by fate. But the\r\nsect of the Essens affirm, that fate governs all things, and that\r\nnothing befalls men but what is according to its determination. And for\r\nthe Sadducees, they take away fate, and say there is no such thing, and\r\nthat the events of human affairs are not at its disposal; but they\r\nsuppose that all our actions are in our own power, so that we are\r\nourselves the causes of what is good, and receive what is evil from our\r\nown folly. However, I have given a more exact account of these opinions\r\nin the second book of the Jewish War.\r\n\r\n10. But now the generals of Demetrius being willing to recover the\r\ndefeat they had had, gathered a greater army together than they had\r\nbefore, and came against Jonathan; but as soon as he was informed of\r\ntheir coming, he went suddenly to meet them, to the country of Hamoth,\r\nfor he resolved to give them no opportunity of coming into Judea; so he\r\npitched his camp at fifty furlongs' distance from the enemy, and sent\r\nout spies to take a view of their camp, and after what manner they were\r\nencamped. When his spies had given him full information, and had seized\r\nupon some of them by night, who told him the enemy would soon attack\r\nhim, he, thus apprized beforehand, provided for his security, and placed\r\nwatchmen beyond his camp, and kept all his forces armed all night; and\r\nhe gave them a charge to be of good courage, and to have their minds\r\nprepared to fight in the night time, if they should be obliged so to do,\r\nlest their enemy's designs should seem concealed from them. But when\r\nDemetrius's commanders were informed that Jonathan knew what they\r\nintended, their counsels were disordered, and it alarmed them to find\r\nthat the enemy had discovered those their intentions; nor did they\r\nexpect to overcome them any other way, now they had failed in the snares\r\nthey had laid for them; for should they hazard an open battle, they did\r\nnot think they should be a match for Jonathan's army, so they resolved\r\nto fly; and having lighted many fires, that when the enemy saw them they\r\nmight suppose they were there still, they retired. When Jonathan came to\r\ngive them battle in the morning in their camp, and found it deserted,\r\nand understood they were fled, he pursued them; yet he could not\r\novertake them, for they had already passed over the river Eleutherus,\r\nand were out of danger. So when Jonathan was returned thence, he went\r\ninto Arabia, and fought against the Nabateans, and drove away a great\r\ndeal of their prey, and took [many] captives, and came to Damascus, and\r\nthere sold off what he had taken. About the same time it was that Simon\r\nhis brother went over all Judea and Palestine, as far as Askelon, and\r\nfortified the strong holds; and when he had made them very strong, both\r\nin the edifices erected, and in the garrisons placed in them, he came to\r\nJoppa; and when he had taken it, he brought a great garrison into it,\r\nfor he heard that the people of Joppa were disposed to deliver up the\r\ncity to Demetrius's generals.\r\n\r\n11. When Simon and Jonathan had finished these affairs, they returned to\r\nJerusalem, where Jonathan gathered all the people together, and took\r\ncounsel to restore the walls of Jerusalem, and to rebuild the wall that\r\nencompassed the temple, which had been thrown down, and to make the\r\nplaces adjoining stronger by very high towers; and besides that, to\r\nbuild another wall in the midst of the city, in order to exclude the\r\nmarket-place from the garrison, which was in the citadel, and by that\r\nmeans to hinder them from any plenty of provisions; and moreover, to\r\nmake the fortresses that were in the country much stronger and more\r\ndefensible than they were before. And when these things were approved of\r\nby the multitude, as rightly proposed, Jonathan himself took care of the\r\nbuilding that belonged to the city, and sent Simon away to make the\r\nfortresses in the country more secure than formerly. But Demetrius\r\npassed over [Euphrates], and came into Mesopotamia, as desirous to\r\nretain that country still, as well as Babylon; and when he should have\r\nobtained the dominion of the upper provinces, to lay a foundation for\r\nrecovering his entire kingdom; for those Greeks and Macedonians who\r\ndwelt there frequently sent ambassadors to him, and promised, that if he\r\nwould come to them, they would deliver themselves up to him, and assist\r\nhim in fighting against Arsaces, 12 the king of the Parthians. So he was\r\nelevated with these hopes, and came hastily to them, as having resolved,\r\nthat if he had once overthrown the Parthians, and gotten an army of his\r\nown, he would make war against Trypho, and eject him out of Syria; and\r\nthe people of that country received him with great alacrity. So he\r\nraised forces, with which he fought against Arsaces, and lost all his\r\narmy, and was himself taken alive, as we have elsewhere related.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How Jonathan Was Slain By Treachery; And How Thereupon The\r\nJews Made Simon Their General And High Priest: What Courageous Actions\r\nHe Also Performed Especially Against Trypho.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Trypho knew what had befallen Demetrius, he was no longer\r\nfirm to Antiochus, but contrived by subtlety to kill him, and then take\r\npossession of his kingdom; but the fear that he was in of Jonathan was\r\nan obstacle to this his design, for Jonathan was a friend to Antiochus,\r\nfor which cause he resolved first to take Jonathan out of the way, and\r\nthen to set about his design relating to Antiochus; but he judging it\r\nbest to take him off by deceit and treachery, came from Antioch to\r\nBethshan, which by the Greeks is called Scythopolis, at which place\r\nJonathan met him with forty thousand chosen men, for he thought that he\r\ncame to fight him; but when he perceived that Jonathan was ready to\r\nfight, he attempted to gain him by presents and kind treatment, and gave\r\norder to his captains to obey him, and by these means was desirous to\r\ngive assurance of his good-will, and to take away all suspicions out of\r\nhis mind, that so he might make him careless and inconsiderate, and\r\nmight take him when he was unguarded. He also advised him to dismiss his\r\narmy, because there was no occasion for bringing it with him when there\r\nwas no war, but all was in peace. However, he desired him to retain a\r\nfew about him, and go with him to Ptolemais, for that he would deliver\r\nthe city up to him, and would bring all the fortresses that were in the\r\ncountry under his dominion; and he told him that he came with those very\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\n2. Yet did not Jonathan suspect any thing at all by this his management,\r\nbut believed that Trypho gave him this advice out of kindness, and with\r\na sincere design. Accordingly, he dismissed his army, and retained no\r\nmore than three thousand of them with him, and left two thousand in\r\nGalilee; and he himself, with one thousand, came with Trypho to\r\nPtolemais. But when the people of Ptolemais had shut their gates, as it\r\nhad been commanded by Trypho to do, he took Jonathan alive, and slew all\r\nthat were with him. He also sent soldiers against those two thousand\r\nthat were left in Galilee, in order to destroy them; but those men\r\nhaving heard the report of what had happened to Jonathan, they prevented\r\nthe execution; and before those that were sent by Trypho came, they\r\ncovered themselves with their armor, and went away out of the country.\r\nNow when those that were sent against them saw that they were ready to\r\nfight for their lives, they gave them no disturbance, but returned back\r\nto Trypho.\r\n\r\n3. But when the people of Jerusalem heard that Jonathan was taken, and\r\nthat the soldiers who were with him were destroyed, they deplored his\r\nsad fate; and there was earnest inquiry made about him by every body,\r\nand a great and just fear fell upon them, and made them sad, lest, now\r\nthey were deprived of the courage and conduct of Jonathan, the nations\r\nabout them should bear them ill-will; and as they were before quiet on\r\naccount of Jonathan they should now rise up against them, and by making\r\nwar with them, should force them into the utmost dangers. And indeed\r\nwhat they suspected really befell them; for when those nations heard of\r\nthe death of Jonathan, they began to make war with the Jews as now\r\ndestitute of a governor and Trypho himself got an army together, and had\r\nintention to go up to Judea, and make war against its inhabitants. But\r\nwhen Simon saw that the people of Jerusalem were terrified at the\r\ncircumstances they were in, he desired to make a speech to them, and\r\nthereby to render them more resolute in opposing Trypho when he should\r\ncome against them. He then called the people together into the temple,\r\nand thence began thus to encourage them: \"O my countrymen, you are not\r\nignorant that our father, myself, and my brethren, have ventured to\r\nhazard our lives, and that willingly, for the recovery of your liberty;\r\nsince I have therefore such plenty of examples before me, and we of our\r\nfamily have determined with ourselves to die for our laws, and our\r\nDivine worship, there shall no terror be so great as to banish this\r\nresolution from our souls, nor to introduce in its place a love of life,\r\nand a contempt of glory. Do you therefore follow me with alacrity\r\nwhithersoever I shall lead you, as not destitute of such a captain as is\r\nwilling to suffer, and to do the greatest things for you; for neither am\r\nI better than my brethren that I should be sparing of my own life, nor\r\nso far worse than they as to avoid and refuse what they thought the most\r\nhonorable of all things,—I mean, to undergo death for your laws, and for\r\nthat worship of God which is peculiar to you; I will therefore give such\r\nproper demonstrations as will show that I am their own brother; and I am\r\nso bold as to expect that I shall avenge their blood upon our enemies,\r\nand deliver you all with your wives and children from the injuries they\r\nintend against you, and, with God's assistance, to preserve your temple\r\nfrom destruction by them; for I see that these nations have you in\r\ncontempt, as being without a governor, and that they thence are\r\nencouraged to make war against you.\"\r\n\r\n4. By this speech of Simon he inspired the multitude with courage; and\r\nas they had been before dispirited through fear, they were now raised to\r\na good hope of better things, insomuch that the whole multitude of the\r\npeople cried out all at once that Simon should be their leader; and that\r\ninstead of Judas and Jonathan his brethren, he should have the\r\ngovernment over them; and they promised that they would readily obey him\r\nin whatsoever he should command them. So he got together immediately all\r\nhis own soldiers that were fit for war, and made haste in rebuilding the\r\nwalls of the city, and strengthening them by very high and strong\r\ntowers, and sent a friend of his, one Jonathan, the son of Absalom, to\r\nJoppa, and gave him order to eject the inhabitants out of the city, for\r\nhe was afraid lest they should deliver up the city to Trypho; but he\r\nhimself staid to secure Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n5. But Trypho removed from Ptolemais with a great army, and came into\r\nJudea, and brought Jonathan with him in bonds. Simon also met him with\r\nhis army at the city Adida, which is upon a hill, and beneath it lie the\r\nplains of Judea. And when Trypho knew that Simon was by the Jews made\r\ntheir governor, he sent to him, and would have imposed upon him by\r\ndeceit and trenchery, and desired, if he would have his brother Jonathan\r\nreleased, that he would send him a hundred talents of silver, and two of\r\nJonathan's sons as hostages, that when he shall be released, he may not\r\nmake Judea revolt from the king; for that at present he was kept in\r\nbonds on account of the money he had borrowed of the king, and now owed\r\nit to him. But Simon was aware of the craft of Trypho; and although he\r\nknew that if he gave him the money he should lose it, and that Trypho\r\nwould not set his brother free and withal should deliver the sons of\r\nJonathan to the enemy, yet because he was afraid that he should have a\r\ncalumny raised against him among the multitude as the cause of his\r\nbrother's death, if he neither gave the money, nor sent Jonathan's sons,\r\nhe gathered his army together, and told them what offers Trypho had\r\nmade; and added this, that the offers were ensnaring and treacherous,\r\nand yet that it was more eligible to send the money and Jonathan's sons,\r\nthan to be liable to the imputation of not complying with Trypho's\r\noffers, and thereby refusing to save his brother. Accordingly, Simon\r\nsent the sons of Jonathan and the money; but when Trypho had received\r\nthem, he did not keep his promise, nor set Jonathan free, but took his\r\narmy, and went about all the country, and resolved to go afterward to\r\nJerusalem by the way of Idumea, while Simon went over against him with\r\nhis army, and all along pitched his own camp over against his.\r\n\r\n6. But when those that were in the citadel had sent to Trypho, and\r\nbesought him to make haste and come to them, and to send them\r\nprovisions, he prepared his cavalry as though he would be at Jerusalem\r\nthat very night; but so great a quantity of snow fell in the night, that\r\nit covered the roads, and made them so deep, that there was no passing,\r\nespecially for the cavalry. This hindered him from coming to Jerusalem;\r\nwhereupon Trypho removed thence, and came into Celesyria, and falling\r\nvehemently upon the land of Gilead, he slew Jonathan there; and when he\r\nhad given order for his burial, he returned himself to Antioch. However,\r\nSimon sent some to the city Basca to bring away his brother's bones, and\r\nburied them in their own city Modin; and all the people made great\r\nlamentation over him. Simon also erected a very large monument for his\r\nfather and his brethren, of white and polished stone, and raised it a\r\ngreat height, and so as to be seen a long way off, and made cloisters\r\nabout it, and set up pillars, which were of one stone apiece; a work it\r\nwas wonderful to see. Moreover, he built seven pyramids also for his\r\nparents and his brethren, one for each of them, which were made very\r\nsurprising, both for their largeness and beauty, and which have been\r\npreserved to this day; and we know that it was Simon who bestowed so\r\nmuch zeal about the burial of Jonathan, and the building of these\r\nmonuments for his relations. Now Jonathan died when he had been high\r\npriest four years 13 and had been also the governor of his nation. And\r\nthese were the circumstances that concerned his death.\r\n\r\n7. But Simon, who was made high priest by the multitude, on the very\r\nfirst year of his high priesthood set his people free from their slavery\r\nunder the Macedonians, and permitted them to pay tribute to them no\r\nlonger; which liberty and freedom from tribute they obtained after a\r\nhundred and seventy years 14 of the kingdom of the Assyrians, which was\r\nafter Seleucus, who was called Nicator, got the dominion over Syria. Now\r\nthe affection of the multitude towards Simon was so great, that in their\r\ncontracts one with another, and in their public records, they wrote, \"in\r\nthe first year of Simon the benefactor and ethnarch of the Jews;\" for\r\nunder him they were very happy, and overcame the enemies that were round\r\nabout them; for Simon overthrew the city Gazara, and Joppa, and Jamhis.\r\nHe also took the citadel of Jerusalem by siege, and cast it down to the\r\nground, that it might not be any more a place of refuge to their enemies\r\nwhen they took it, to do them a mischief, as it had been till now. And\r\nwhen he had done this, he thought it their best way, and most for their\r\nadvantage, to level the very mountain itself upon which the citadel\r\nhappened to stand, that so the temple might be higher than it. And\r\nindeed, when he had called the multitude to an assembly, he persuaded\r\nthem to have it so demolished, and this by putting them in mind what\r\nmiseries they had suffered by its garrison and the Jewish deserters, and\r\nwhat miseries they might hereafter suffer in case any foreigner should\r\nobtain the kingdom, and put a garrison into that citadel. This speech\r\ninduced the multitude to a compliance, because he exhorted them to do\r\nnothing but what was for their own good: so they all set themselves to\r\nthe work, and leveled the mountain, and in that work spent both day and\r\nnight without any intermission, which cost them three whole years before\r\nit was removed, and brought to an entire level with the plain of the\r\nrest of the city. After which the temple was the highest of all the\r\nbuildings, now the citadel, as well as the mountain whereon it stood,\r\nwere demolished. And these actions were thus performed under Simon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How Simon Confederated Himself With Antiochus Pius, And Made\r\nWar Against Trypho, And A Little Afterward, Against Cendebeus, The\r\nGeneral Of Antiochus's Army; As Also How Simon Was Murdered By His Son-\r\nIn-Law Ptolemy, And That By Treachery.\r\n\r\n1. 15 Now a little while after Demetrius had been carried into\r\ncaptivity, Trypho his governor destroyed Antiochus, 16 the son of\r\nAlexander, who was also called The God, 17 and this when he had reigned\r\nfour years, though he gave it out that he died under the hands of the\r\nsurgeons. He then sent his friends, and those that were most intimate\r\nwith him, to the soldiers, and promised that he would give them a great\r\ndeal of money if they would make him king. He intimated to them that\r\nDemetrius was made a captive by the Parthians; and that Demetrius's\r\nbrother Atitiochus, if he came to be king, would do them a great deal of\r\nmischief, in way of revenge for their revolting from his brother. So the\r\nsoldiers, in expectation of the wealth they should get by bestowing the\r\nkingdom on Trypho, made him their ruler. However, when Trypho had gained\r\nthe management of affairs, he demonstrated his disposition to be wicked;\r\nfor while he was a private person, he cultivated familiarity with the\r\nmultitude, and pretended to great moderation, and so drew them on\r\nartfully to whatsoever he pleased; but when he had once taken the\r\nkingdom, he laid aside any further dissimulation, and was the true\r\nTrypho; which behavior made his enemies superior to him; for the\r\nsoldiery hated him, and revolted from him to Cleopatra, the wife of\r\nDemetrius, who was then shut up in Seleucia with her children. But as\r\nAntiochus, the brother of Demetrius who was called Soter, was not\r\nadmitted by any of the cities on account of Trypho, Cleopatra sent to\r\nhim, and invited him to marry her, and to take the kingdom. The reasons\r\nwhy she made this invitation were these: That her friends persuaded her\r\nto it, and that she was afraid for herself, in case some of the people\r\nof Seleucia should deliver up the city to Trypho.\r\n\r\n2. As Antiochus was now come to Seleucia, and his forces increased every\r\nday, he marched to fight Trypho; and having beaten him in the battle, he\r\nejected him out of the Upper Syria into Phoenicia, and pursued him\r\nthither, and besieged him in Dora which was a fortress hard to be taken,\r\nwhither he had fled. He also sent ambassadors to Simon the Jewish high\r\npriest, about a league of friendship and mutual assistance; who readily\r\naccepted of the invitation, and sent to Antiochus great sums of money\r\nand provisions for those that besieged Dora, and thereby supplied them\r\nvery plentifully, so that for a little while he was looked upon as one\r\nof his most intimate friends; but still Trypho fled from Dora to Apamia,\r\nwhere he was taken during the siege, and put to death, when he had\r\nreigned three years.\r\n\r\n3. However, Antiochus forgot the kind assistance that Simon had afforded\r\nhim in his necessity, by reason of his covetous and wicked disposition,\r\nand committed an army of soldiers to his friend Cendebeus, and sent him\r\nat once to ravage Judea, and to seize Simon. When Simon heard of\r\nAntiochus's breaking his league with him, although he were now in years,\r\nyet, provoked with the unjust treatment he had met with from Antiochus,\r\nand taking a resolution brisker than his age could well bear, he went\r\nlike a young man to act as general of his army. He also sent his sons\r\nbefore among the most hardy of his soldiers, and he himself marched on\r\nwith his army another way, and laid many of his men in ambushes in the\r\nnarrow valleys between the mountains; nor did he fail of success in any\r\none of his attempts, but was too hard for his enemies in every one of\r\nthem. So he led the rest of his life in peace, and did also himself make\r\na league with the Romans.\r\n\r\n4. Now he was the ruler of the Jews in all eight years; but at a feast\r\ncame to his end. It was caused by the treachery of his son-in-law\r\nPtolemy, who caught also his wife, and two of his sons, and kept them in\r\nbonds. He also sent some to kill John the third son, whose name was\r\nHyrcanus; but the young man perceiving them coming, he avoided the\r\ndanger he was in from them, 18 and made haste into the city [Jerusalem],\r\nas relying on the good-will of the multitude, because of the benefits\r\nthey had received from his father, and because of the hatred the same\r\nmultitude bare to Ptolemy; so that when Ptolemy was endeavoring to enter\r\nthe city by another gate, they drove him away, as having already\r\nadmitted Hyrcanus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. Hyrcanus Receives The High Priesthood, And Ejects Ptolemy Out\r\nOf The Country. Antiochus Makes War Against Hyrcanus And Afterwards\r\nMakes A League With Him.\r\n\r\n1. So Ptolemy retired to one of the fortresses that was above Jericho,\r\nwhich was called Dagon. But Hyrcanus having taken the high priesthood\r\nthat had been his father's before, and in the first place propitiated\r\nGod by sacrifices, he then made an expedition against Ptolemy; and when\r\nhe made his attacks upon the place, in other points he was too hard for\r\nhim, but was rendered weaker than he, by the commiseration he had for\r\nhis mother and brethren, and by that only; for Ptolemy brought them upon\r\nthe wall, and tormented them in the sight of all, and threatened that he\r\nwould throw them down headlong, unless Hyrcanus would leave off the\r\nsiege. And as he thought that so far as he relaxed as to the siege and\r\ntaking of the place, so much favor did he show to those that were\r\ndearest to him by preventing their misery, his zeal about it was cooled.\r\nHowever, his mother spread out her hands, and begged of him that he\r\nwould not grow remiss on her account, but indulge his indignation so\r\nmuch the more, and that he would do his utmost to take the place\r\nquickly, in order to get their enemy under his power, and then to avenge\r\nupon him what he had done to those that were dearest to himself; for\r\nthat death would be to her sweet, though with torment, if that enemy of\r\ntheirs might but be brought to punishment for his wicked dealings to\r\nthem. Now when his mother said so, he resolved to take the fortress\r\nimmediately; but when he saw her beaten, and torn to pieces, his courage\r\nfailed him, and he could not but sympathize with what his mother\r\nsuffered, and was thereby overcome. And as the siege was drawn out into\r\nlength by this means, that year on which the Jews used to rest came on;\r\nfor the Jews observe this rest every seventh year, as they do every\r\nseventh day; so that Ptolemy being for this cause released from the war,\r\n19 he slew the brethren of Hyrcanus, and his mother; and when he had so\r\ndone, he fled to Zeno, who was called Cotylas, who was then the tyrant\r\nof the city Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n2. But Antiochus, being very uneasy at the miseries that Simon had\r\nbrought upon him, he invaded Judea in the fourth years' of his reign,\r\nand the first year of the principality of Hyrcanus, in the hundred and\r\nsixty-second olympiad. 20 And when he had burnt the country, he shut up\r\nHyrcanus in the city, which he encompassed round with seven encampments;\r\nbut did just nothing at the first, because of the strength of the walls,\r\nand because of the valor of the besieged, although they were once in\r\nwant of water, which yet they were delivered from by a large shower of\r\nrain, which fell at the setting of the Pleiades 21 However, about the\r\nnorth part of the wall, where it happened the city was upon a level with\r\nthe outward ground, the king raised a hundred towers of three stories\r\nhigh, and placed bodies of soldiers upon them; and as he made his\r\nattacks every day, he cut a double ditch, deep and broad, and confined\r\nthe inhabitants within it as within a wall; but the besieged contrived\r\nto make frequent sallies out; and if the enemy were not any where upon\r\ntheir guard, they fell upon them, and did them a great deal of mischief;\r\nand if they perceived them, they then retired into the city with ease.\r\nBut because Hyrcanus discerned the inconvenience of so great a number of\r\nmen in the city, while the provisions were the sooner spent by them, and\r\nyet, as is natural to suppose, those great numbers did nothing, he\r\nseparated the useless part, and excluded them out of the city, and\r\nretained that part only which were in the flower of their age, and fit\r\nfor war. However, Antiochus would not let those that were excluded go\r\naway, who therefore wandering about between the wails, and consuming\r\naway by famine, died miserably; but when the feast of tabernacles was at\r\nhand, those that were within commiserated their condition, and received\r\nthem in again. And when Hyrcanus sent to Antiochus, and desired there\r\nmight be a truce for seven days, because of the festival, he gave way to\r\nthis piety towards God, and made that truce accordingly. And besides\r\nthat, he sent in a magnificent sacrifice, bulls with their horns gilded,\r\nwith all sorts of sweet spices, and with cups of gold and silver. 22 So\r\nthose that were at the gates received the sacrifices from those that\r\nbrought them, and led them to the temple, Antiochus the mean while\r\nfeasting his army, which was a quite different conduct from Antiochus\r\nEpiphanes, who, when he had taken the city, offered swine upon the\r\naltar, and sprinkled the temple with the broth of their flesh, in order\r\nto violate the laws of the Jews, and the religion they derived from\r\ntheir forefathers; for which reason our nation made war with him, and\r\nwould never be reconciled to him; but for this Antiochus, all men called\r\nhim Antiochus the Pious, for the great zeal he had about religion.\r\n\r\n3. Accordingly, Hyrcanus took this moderation of his kindly; and when he\r\nunderstood how religious he was towards the Deity, he sent an embassage\r\nto him, and desired that he would restore the settlements they received\r\nfrom their forefathers. So he rejected the counsel of those that would\r\nhave him utterly destroy the nation, 23 by reason of their way of\r\nliving, which was to others unsociable, and did not regard what they\r\nsaid. But being persuaded that all they did was out of a religious mind,\r\nhe answered the ambassadors, that if the besieged would deliver up their\r\narms, and pay tribute for Joppa, and the other cities which bordered\r\nupon Judea, and admit a garrison of his, on these terms he would make\r\nwar against them no longer. But the Jews, although they were content\r\nwith the other conditions, did not agree to admit the garrison, because\r\nthey could not associate with other people, nor converse with them; yet\r\nwere they willing, instead of the admission of the garrison, to give him\r\nhostages, and five hundred talents of silver; of which they paid down\r\nthree hundred, and sent the hostages immediately, which king Antiochus\r\naccepted. One of those hostages was Hyrcanus's brother. But still he\r\nbroke down the fortifications that encompassed the city. And upon these\r\nconditions Antiochus broke up the siege, and departed.\r\n\r\n4. But Hyrcanus opened the sepulcher of David, who excelled all other\r\nkings in riches, and took out of it three thousand talents. He was also\r\nthe first of the Jews that, relying on this wealth, maintained foreign\r\ntroops. There was also a league of friendship and mutual assistance made\r\nbetween them; upon which Hyrcanus admitted him into the city, and\r\nfurnished him with whatsoever his army wanted in great plenty, and with\r\ngreat generosity, and marched along with him when he made an expedition\r\nagainst the Parthians; of which Nicolaus of Damascus is a witness for\r\nus; who in his history writes thus: \"When Antiochus had erected a trophy\r\nat the river Lycus, upon his conquest of Indates, the general of the\r\nParthians, he staid there two days. It was at the desire of Lyrcanus the\r\nJew, because it was such a festival derived to them from their\r\nforefathers, whereon the law of the Jews did not allow them to travel.\"\r\nAnd truly he did not speak falsely in saying so; for that festival,\r\nwhich we call Pentecost, did then fall out to be the next day to the\r\nSabbath. Nor is it lawful for us to journey, either on the Sabbath day,\r\nor on a festival day 24 But when Antiochus joined battle with Arsaces,\r\nthe king of Parthia, he lost a great part of his army, and was himself\r\nslain; and his brother Demetrius succeeded in the kingdom of Syria, by\r\nthe permission of Arsaces, who freed him from his captivity at the same\r\ntime that Antiochus attacked Parthia, as we have formerly related\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. How, After The Death Of Antiochus, Hyrcanus Made An\r\nExpedition Against Syria, And Made A League With The Romans. Concerning\r\nThe Death Of King Demetrius And Alexander.\r\n\r\n1. But when Hyrcanus heard of the death of Antiochus, he presently made\r\nan expedition against the cities of Syria, hoping to find them destitute\r\nof fighting men, and of such as were able to defend them. However, it\r\nwas not till the sixth month that he took Medaba, and that not without\r\nthe greatest distress of his army. After this he took Samega, and the\r\nneighboring places; and besides these, Shechem and Gerizzim, and the\r\nnation of the Cutheans, who dwelt at the temple which resembled that\r\ntemple which was at Jerusalem, and which Alexander permitted Sanballat,\r\nthe general of his army, to build for the sake of Manasseh, who was son-\r\nin-law to Jaddua the high priest, as we have formerly related; which\r\ntemple was now deserted two hundred years after it was built. Hyrcanus\r\ntook also Dora and Marissa, cities of Idumea, and subdued all the\r\nIdumeans; and permitted them to stay in that country, if they would\r\ncircumcise their genitals, and make use of the laws of the Jews; and\r\nthey were so desirous of living in the country of their forefathers,\r\nthat they submitted to the use of circumcision, 25 and of the rest of\r\nthe Jewish ways of living; at which time therefore this befell them,\r\nthat they were hereafter no other than Jews.\r\n\r\n2. But Hyrcanus the high priest was desirous to renew that league of\r\nfriendship they had with the Romans. Accordingly, he sent an embassage\r\nto them; and when the senate had received their epistle, they made a\r\nleague of friendship with them, after the manner following: \"Fanius, the\r\nson of Marcus, the praetor, gathered the senate together on the eighth\r\nday before the Ides of February, in the senate-house, when Lucius\r\nManlius, the son of Lucius, of the Mentine tribe, and Caius Sempronius,\r\nthe son of Caius, of the Falernian tribe, were present. The occasion\r\nwas, that the ambassadors sent by the people of the Jews 26 Simon, the\r\nson of Dositheus, and Apollonius, the son of Alexander, and Diodorus,\r\nthe son of Jason, who were good and virtuous men, had somewhat to\r\npropose about that league of friendship and mutual assistance which\r\nsubsisted between them and the Romans, and about other public affairs,\r\nwho desired that Joppa, and the havens, and Gazara, and the springs [of\r\nJordan], and the several other cities and countries of theirs, which\r\nAntiochus had taken from them in the war, contrary to the decree of the\r\nsenate, might be restored to them; and that it might not be lawful for\r\nthe king's troops to pass through their country, and the countries of\r\nthose that are subject to them; and that what attempts Antiochus had\r\nmade during that war, without the decree of the senate, might be made\r\nvoid; and that they would send ambassadors, who should take care that\r\nrestitution be made them of what Antiochus had taken from them, and that\r\nthey should make an estimate of the country that had been laid waste in\r\nthe war; and that they would grant them letters of protection to the\r\nkings and free people, in order to their quiet return home. It was\r\ntherefore decreed, as to these points, to renew their league of\r\nfriendship and mutual assistance with these good men, and who were sent\r\nby a good and a friendly people.\" But as to the letters desired, their\r\nanswer was, that the senate would consult about that matter when their\r\nown affairs would give them leave; and that they would endeavor, for the\r\ntime to come, that no like injury should be done to them; and that their\r\npraetor Fanius should give them money out of the public treasury to bear\r\ntheir expenses home. And thus did Fanius dismiss the Jewish ambassadors,\r\nand gave them money out of the public treasury; and gave the decree of\r\nthe senate to those that were to conduct them, and to take care that\r\nthey should return home in safety.\r\n\r\n3. And thus stood the affairs of Hyrcanus the high priest. But as for\r\nking Demetrius, who had a mind to make war against Hyrcanus, there was\r\nno opportunity nor room for it, while both the Syrians and the soldiers\r\nbare ill-will to him, because he was an ill man. But when they had sent\r\nambassadors to Ptolemy, who was called Physcon, that he would send them\r\none of the family at Seleueus, in order to take the kingdom, and he had\r\nsent them Alexander, who was called Zebina, with an army, and there had\r\nbeen a battle between them, Demetrius was beaten in the fight, and fled\r\nto Cleopatra his wife, to Ptolemais; but his wife would not receive him.\r\nHe went thence to Tyre, and was there caught; and when he had suffered\r\nmuch from his enemies before his death, he was slain by them. So\r\nAlexander took the kingdom, and made a league with Hyrcanus, who yet,\r\nwhen he afterward fought with Antiochus the son of Demetrius, who was\r\ncalled Grypus, was also beaten in the fight, and slain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. How Upon The Quarrel Between Antiochus Grypus And Antiochus\r\nCyzicenus About The Kingdom Hyrcanus Tooksamaria, And Utterly Demolished\r\nIt; And How Hyrcanus Joined Himself To The Sect Of The Sadducees, And\r\nLeft That Of The Pharisees.\r\n\r\n1. When Antiochus had taken the kingdom, he was afraid to make war\r\nagainst Judea, because he heard that his brother by the same mother, who\r\nwas also called Antiochus, was raising an army against him out of\r\nCyzicum; so he staid in his own land, and resolved to prepare himself\r\nfor the attack he expected from his brother, who was called Cyzicenus,\r\nbecause he had been brought up in that city. He was the son of Antiochus\r\nthat was called Soter, who died in Parthia. He was the brother of\r\nDemetrius, the father of Grypus; for it had so happened, that one and\r\nthe same Cleopatra was married to two who were brethren, as we have\r\nrelated elsewhere. But Antiochus Cyzicenus coming into Syria, continued\r\nmany years at war with his brother. Now Hyrcanus lived all this while in\r\npeace; for after the death of Antiochus, he revolted from the\r\nMacedonians, 27 nor did he any longer pay them the least regard, either\r\nas their subject or their friend; but his affairs were in a very\r\nimproving and flourishing condition in the times of Alexander Zebina,\r\nand especially under these brethren, for the war which they had with one\r\nanother gave Hyrcanus the opportunity of enjoying himself in Judea\r\nquietly, insomuch that he got an immense quantity of money. How ever,\r\nwhen Antiochus Cyzicenus distressed his land, he then openly showed what\r\nhe meant. And when he saw that Antiochus was destitute of Egyptian\r\nauxiliaries, and that both he and his brother were in an ill condition\r\nin the struggles they had one with another, he despised them both.\r\n\r\n2. So he made an expedition against Samaria which was a very strong\r\ncity; of whose present name Sebaste, and its rebuilding by Herod, we\r\nshall speak at a proper time; but he made his attack against it, and\r\nbesieged it with a great deal of pains; for he was greatly displeased\r\nwith the Samaritans for the injuries they had done to the people of\r\nMerissa, a colony of the Jews, and confederate with them, and this in\r\ncompliance to the kings of Syria. When he had therefore drawn a ditch,\r\nand built a double wall round the city, which was fourscore furlongs\r\nlong, he set his sons Antigonus and Arisrobulna over the siege; which\r\nbrought the Samaritans to that great distress by famine, that they were\r\nforced to eat what used not to be eaten, and to call for Antiochus\r\nCyzicenus to help them, who came readily to their assistance, but was\r\nbeaten by Aristobulus; and when he was pursued as far as Scythopolis by\r\nthe two brethren, he got away. So they returned to Samaria, and shut\r\nthem again within the wall, till they were forced to send for the same\r\nAntiochus a second time to help them, who procured about six thousand\r\nmen from Ptolemy Lathyrus, which were sent them without his mother's\r\nconsent, who had then in a manner turned him out of his government. With\r\nthese Egyptians Antiochus did at first overrun and ravage the country of\r\nHyrcanus after the manner of a robber, for he durst not meet him in the\r\nface to fight with him, as not having an army sufficient for that\r\npurpose, but only from this supposal, that by thus harassing his land he\r\nshould force Hyrcanus to raise the siege of Samaria; but because he fell\r\ninto snares, and lost many of his soldiers therein, he went away to\r\nTripoli, and committed the prosecution of the war against the Jews to\r\nCallimander and Epicrates.\r\n\r\n3. But as to Callimander, he attacked the enemy too rashly, and was put\r\nto flight, and destroyed immediately; and as to Epicrates, he was such a\r\nlover of money, that he openly betrayed Scythopolis, and other places\r\nnear it, to the Jews, but was not able to make them raise the siege of\r\nSamaria. And when Hyrcanus had taken that city, which was not done till\r\nafter a year's siege, he was not contented with doing that only, but he\r\ndemolished it entirely, and brought rivulets to it to drown it, for he\r\ndug such hollows as might let the water run under it; nay, he took away\r\nthe very marks that there had ever been such a city there. Now a very\r\nsurprising thing is related of this high priest Hyrcanus, how God came\r\nto discourse with him; for they say that on the very same day on which\r\nhis sons fought with Antiochus Cyzicenus, he was alone in the temple, as\r\nhigh priest, offering incense, and heard a voice, that his sons had just\r\nthen overcome Antiochus. And this he openly declared before all the\r\nmultitude upon his coming out of the temple; and it accordingly proved\r\ntrue; and in this posture were the affairs of Hyrcanus.\r\n\r\n4. Now it happened at this time, that not only those Jews who were at\r\nJerusalem and in Judea were in prosperity, but also those of them that\r\nwere at Alexandria, and in Egypt and Cyprus; for Cleopatra the queen was\r\nat variance with her son Ptolemy, who was called Lathyrus, and appointed\r\nfor her generals Chelcias and Ananias, the sons of that Onias who built\r\nthe temple in the prefecture of Heliopolis, like to that at Jerusalem,\r\nas we have elsewhere related. Cleopatra intrusted these men with her\r\narmy, and did nothing without their advice, as Strabo of Cappadocia\r\nattests, when he saith thus, \"Now the greater part, both those that came\r\nto Cyprus with us, and those that were sent afterward thither, revolted\r\nto Ptolemy immediately; only those that were called Onias's party, being\r\nJews, continued faithful, because their countrymen Chelcias and Ananias\r\nwere in chief favor with the queen.\" These are the words of Strabo.\r\n\r\n5. However, this prosperous state of affairs moved the Jews to envy\r\nHyrcanus; but they that were the worst disposed to him were the\r\nPharisees, 28 who were one of the sects of the Jews, as we have informed\r\nyou already. These have so great a power over the multitude, that when\r\nthey say any thing against the king, or against the high priest, they\r\nare presently believed. Now Hyrcanus was a disciple of theirs, and\r\ngreatly beloved by them. And when he once invited them to a feast, and\r\nentertained them very kindly, when he saw them in a good humor, he began\r\nto say to them, that they knew he was desirous to be a righteous man,\r\nand to do all things whereby he might please God, which was the\r\nprofession of the Pharisees also. However, he desired, that if they\r\nobserved him offending in any point, and going out of the right way,\r\nthey would call him back and correct him. On which occasion they\r\nattested to his being entirely virtuous; with which commendation he was\r\nwell pleased. But still there was one of his guests there, whose name\r\nwas Eleazar, a man of an ill temper, and delighting in seditious\r\npractices. This man said, \"Since thou desirest to know the truth, if\r\nthou wilt be righteous in earnest, lay down the high priesthood, and\r\ncontent thyself with the civil government of the people,\" And when he\r\ndesired to know for what cause he ought to lay down the high priesthood,\r\nthe other replied, \"We have heard it from old men, that thy mother had\r\nbeen a captive under the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes. 29\" This story\r\nwas false, and Hyrcanus was provoked against him; and all the Pharisees\r\nhad a very great indignation against him.\r\n\r\n6. Now there was one Jonathan, a very great friend of Hyrcanus's, but of\r\nthe sect of the Sadducees, whose notions are quite contrary to those of\r\nthe Pharisees. He told Hyrcanus that Eleazar had cast such a reproach\r\nupon him, according to the common sentiments of all the Pharisees, and\r\nthat this would be made manifest if he would but ask them the question,\r\nWhat punishment they thought this man deserved? for that he might depend\r\nupon it, that the reproach was not laid on him with their approbation,\r\nif they were for punishing him as his crime deserved. So the Pharisees\r\nmade answer, that he deserved stripes and bonds, but that it did not\r\nseem right to punish reproaches with death. And indeed the Pharisees,\r\neven upon other occasions, are not apt to be severe in punishments. At\r\nthis gentle sentence, Hyrcanus was very angry, and thought that this man\r\nreproached him by their approbation. It was this Jonathan who chiefly\r\nirritated him, and influenced him so far, that he made him leave the\r\nparty of the Pharisees, and abolish the decrees they had imposed on the\r\npeople, and to punish those that observed them. From this source arose\r\nthat hatred which he and his sons met with from the multitude: but of\r\nthese matters we shall speak hereafter. What I would now explain is\r\nthis, that the Pharisees have delivered to the people a great many\r\nobservances by succession from their fathers, which are not written in\r\nthe laws of Moses; and for that reason it is that the Sadducees reject\r\nthem, and say that we are to esteem those observances to be obligatory\r\nwhich are in the written word, but are not to observe what are derived\r\nfrom the tradition of our forefathers. And concerning these things it is\r\nthat great disputes and differences have arisen among them, while the\r\nSadducees are able to persuade none but the rich, and have not the\r\npopulace obsequious to them, but the Pharisees have the multitude on\r\ntheir side. But about these two sects, and that of the Essens, I have\r\ntreated accurately in the second book of Jewish affairs.\r\n\r\n7. But when Hyrcanus had put an end to this sedition, he after that\r\nlived happily, and administered the government in the best manner for\r\nthirty-one years, and then died, 30 leaving behind him five sons. He was\r\nesteemed by God worthy of three of the greatest privileges,—the\r\ngovernment of his nation, the dignity of the high priesthood, and\r\nprophecy; for God was with him, and enabled him to know futurities; and\r\nto foretell this in particular, that, as to his two eldest sons, he\r\nforetold that they would not long continue in the government of public\r\naffairs; whose unhappy catastrophe will be worth our description, that\r\nwe may thence learn how very much they were inferior to their father's\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. How Aristobulus, When He Had Taken The Government First Of\r\nAll Put A Diadem On His Head, And Was Most Barbarously Cruel To His\r\nMother And His Brethren; And How, After He Had Slain Antigonus, He\r\nHimself Died.\r\n\r\n1. Now when their father Hyrcanus was dead, the eldest son Aristobulus,\r\nintending to change the government into a kingdom, for so he resolved to\r\ndo, first of all put a diadem on his head, four hundred eighty and one\r\nyears and three months after the people had been delivered from the\r\nBabylonish slavery, and were returned to their own country again. This\r\nAristobulus loved his next brother Antigonus, and treated him as his\r\nequal; but the others he held in bonds. He also cast his mother into\r\nprison, because she disputed the government with him; for Hyrcanus had\r\nleft her to be mistress of all. He also proceeded to that degree of\r\nbarbarity, as to kill her in prison with hunger; nay, he was alienated\r\nfrom his brother Antigonus by calumnies, and added him to the rest whom\r\nhe slew; yet he seemed to have an affection for him, and made him above\r\nthe rest a partner with him in the kingdom. Those calumnies he at first\r\ndid not give credit to, partly because he loved him, and so did not give\r\nheed to what was said against him, and partly because he thought the\r\nreproaches were derived from the envy of the relaters. But when\r\nAntigonus was once returned from the army, and that feast was then at\r\nhand when they make tabernacles to [the honor of God,] it happened that\r\nArlstobulus was fallen sick, and that Antigonus went up most splendidly\r\nadorned, and with his soldiers about him in their armor, to the temple\r\nto celebrate the feast, and to put up many prayers for the recovery of\r\nhis brother, when some wicked persons, who had a great mind to raise a\r\ndifference between the brethren, made use of this opportunity of the\r\npompous appearance of Antigonus, and of the great actions which he had\r\ndone, and went to the king, and spitefully aggravated the pompous show\r\nof his at the feast, and pretended that all these circumstances were not\r\nlike those of a private person; that these actions were indications of\r\nan affectation of royal authority; and that his coming with a strong\r\nbody of men must be with an intention to kill him; and that his way of\r\nreasoning was this: That it was a silly thing in him, while it was in\r\nhis power to reign himself, to look upon it as a great favor that he was\r\nhonored with a lower dignity by his brother.\r\n\r\n2. Aristobulus yielded to these imputations, but took care both that his\r\nbrother should not suspect him, and that he himself might not run the\r\nhazard of his own safety; so he ordered his guards to lie in a certain\r\nplace that was under ground, and dark; [he himself then lying sick in\r\nthe tower which was called Antonia;] and he commanded them, that in case\r\nAntigonus came in to him unarmed, they should not touch any body, but if\r\narmed, they should kill him; yet did he send to Antigonus, and desired\r\nthat he would come unarmed; but the queen, and those that joined with\r\nher in the plot against Antigonus, persuaded the messenger to tell him\r\nthe direct contrary: how his brother had heard that he had made himself\r\na fine suit of armor for war, and desired him to come to him in that\r\narmor, that he might see how fine it was. So Antigonus suspecting no\r\ntreachery, but depending on the good-will of his brother, came to\r\nAristobulus armed, as he used to be, with his entire armor, in order to\r\nshow it to him; but when he was come to a place which was called\r\nStrato's Tower, where the passage happened to be exceeding dark, the\r\nguards slew him; which death of his demonstrates that nothing is\r\nstronger than envy and calumny, and that nothing does more certainly\r\ndivide the good-will and natural affections of men than those passions.\r\nBut here one may take occasion to wonder at one Judas, who was of the\r\nsect of the Essens, 31 and who never missed the truth in his\r\npredictions; for this man, when he saw Antigonus passing by the temple,\r\ncried out to his companions and friends, who abode with him as his\r\nscholars, in order to learn the art of foretelling things to come? \"That\r\nit was good for him to die now, since he had spoken falsely about\r\nAntigonus, who is still alive, and I see him passing by, although he had\r\nforetold he should die at the place called Strato's Tower that very day,\r\nwhile yet the place is six hundred furlongs off, where he had foretold\r\nhe should be slain; and still this day is a great part of it already\r\npast, so that he was in danger of proving a false prophet.\" As he was\r\nsaying this, and that in a melancholy mood, the news came that Antigonus\r\nwas slain in a place under ground, which itself was called also Strato's\r\nTower, or of the same name with that Cæsarea which is seated at the sea.\r\nThis event put the prophet into a great disorder.\r\n\r\n3. But Aristobulus repented immediately of this slaughter of his\r\nbrother; on which account his disease increased upon him, and he was\r\ndisturbed in his mind, upon the guilt of such wickedness, insomuch that\r\nhis entrails were corrupted by his intolerable pain, and he vomited\r\nblood: at which time one of the servants that attended upon him, and was\r\ncarrying his blood away, did, by Divine Providence, as I cannot but\r\nsuppose, slip down, and shed part of his blood at the very place where\r\nthere were spots of Antigonus's blood, there slain, still remaining; and\r\nwhen there was a cry made by the spectators, as if the servant had on\r\npurpose shed the blood on that place, Aristobulus heard it, and inquired\r\nwhat the matter was; and as they did not answer him, he was the more\r\nearnest to know what it was, it being natural to men to suspect that\r\nwhat is thus concealed is very bad: so upon his threatening, and forcing\r\nthem by terrors to speak, they at length told him the truth; whereupon\r\nhe shed many tears, in that disorder of mind which arose from his\r\nconsciousness of what he had done, and gave a deep groan, and said, \"I\r\nam not therefore, I perceive, to be concealed from God, in the impious\r\nand horrid crimes I have been guilty of; but a sudden punishment is\r\ncoming upon me for the shedding the blood of my relations. And now, O\r\nthou most impudent body of mine, how long wilt thou retain a soul that\r\nought to die, in order to appease the ghosts of my brother and my\r\nmother? Why dost thou not give it all up at once? And why do I deliver\r\nup my blood drop by drop to those whom I have so wickedly murdered?\" In\r\nsaying which last words he died, having reigned a year. He was called a\r\nlover of the Grecians; and had conferred many benefits on his own\r\ncountry, and made war against Iturea, and added a great part of it to\r\nJudea, and compelled the inhabitants, if they would continue in that\r\ncountry, to be circumcised, and to live according to the Jewish laws. He\r\nwas naturally a man of candor, and of great modesty, as Strabo bears\r\nwitness, in the name of Timagenes; who says thus: \"This man was a person\r\nof candor, and very serviceable to the Jews; for he added a country to\r\nthem, and obtained a part of the nation of the Itureans for them, and\r\nbound them to them by the bond of the circumcision of their genitals.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. How Alexander When He Had Taken The Government Made An\r\nExpedition Against Ptolemais, And Then Raised The Siege Out Of Fear Of\r\nPtolemy Lathyrus; And How Ptolemy Made War Against Him, Because He Had\r\nSent To Cleopatra To Persuade Her To Make War Against Ptolemy, And Yet\r\nPretended To Be In Friendship With Him, When He Beat The Jews In The\r\nBattle.\r\n\r\n1. When Aristobulus was dead, his wife Salome, who, by the Greeks, was\r\ncalled Alexandra, let his brethren out of prison, [for Aristobulus had\r\nkept them in bonds, as we have said already,] and made Alexander Janneus\r\nking, who was the superior in age and in moderation. This child happened\r\nto be hated by his father as soon as he was born, and could never be\r\npermitted to come into his father's sight till he died. 32 The occasion\r\nof which hatred is thus reported: when Hyrcanus chiefly loved the two\r\neldest of his sons, Antigonus and Aristobulus, God appeared to him in\r\nhis sleep, of whom he inquired which of his sons should be his\r\nsuccessor. Upon God's representing to him the countenance of Alexander,\r\nhe was grieved that he was to be the heir of all his goods, and suffered\r\nhim to be brought up in Galilee, However, God did not deceive Hyrcanus;\r\nfor after the death of Aristobulus, he certainly took the kingdom; and\r\none of his brethren, who affected the kingdom, he slew; and the other,\r\nwho chose to live a private and quiet life, he had in esteem.\r\n\r\n2. When Alexander Janneus had settled the government in the manner that\r\nhe judged best, he made an expedition against Ptolemais; and having\r\novercome the men in battle, he shut them up in the city, and sat round\r\nabout it, and besieged it; for of the maritime cities there remained\r\nonly Ptolemais and Gaza to be conquered, besides Strato's Tower and\r\nDora, which were held by the tyrant Zoilus. Now while Antiochus\r\nPhilometor, and Antiochus who was called Cyzicenus, were making war one\r\nagainst another, and destroying one another's armies, the people of\r\nPtolemais could have no assistance from them; but when they were\r\ndistressed with this siege, Zoilus, who possessed Strato's Tower and\r\nDora, and maintained a legion of soldiers, and, on occasion of the\r\ncontest between the kings, affected tyranny himself, came and brought\r\nsome small assistance to the people of Ptolemais; nor indeed had the\r\nkings such a friendship for them, as that they should hope for any\r\nadvantage from them. Both those kings were in the case of wrestlers, who\r\nfinding themselves deficient in strength, and yet being ashamed to\r\nyield, put off the fight by laziness, and by lying still as long as they\r\ncan. The only hope they had remaining was from the kings of Egypt, and\r\nfrom Ptolemy Lathyrus, who now held Cyprus, and who came to Cyprus when\r\nhe was driven from the government of Egypt by Cleopatra his mother. So\r\nthe people of Ptolemais sent to this Ptolemy Lathyrus, and desired him\r\nto come as a confederate, to deliver them, now they were in such danger,\r\nout of the hands of Alexander. And as the ambassadors gave him hopes,\r\nthat if he would pass over into Syria, he would have the people of Gaza\r\non the side of those of Ptolemais; as also they said, that Zoilus, and\r\nbesides these the Sidonians, and many others, would assist them; so he\r\nwas elevated at this, and got his fleet ready as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n3. But in this interval Demenetus, one that was of abilities to persuade\r\nmen to do as he would have them, and a leader of the populace, made\r\nthose of Ptolemais change their opinions; and said to them, that it was\r\nbetter to run the hazard of being subject to the Jews, than to admit of\r\nevident slavery by delivering themselves up to a master; and besides\r\nthat, to have not only a war at present, but to expect a much greater\r\nwar from Egypt; for that Cleopatra would not overlook an army raised by\r\nPtolemy for himself out of the neighborhood, but would come against them\r\nwith a great army of her own, and this because she was laboring to eject\r\nher son out of Cyprus also; that as for Ptolemy, if he fail of his\r\nhopes, he can still retire to Cyprus, but that they will be left in the\r\ngreatest danger possible. Now Ptolemy, although he had heard of the\r\nchange that was made in the people of Ptolemais, yet did he still go on\r\nwith his voyage, and came to the country called Sycamine, and there set\r\nhis army on shore. This army of his, in the whole horse and foot\r\ntogether, were about thirty thousand, with which he marched near to\r\nPtolemais, and there pitched his camp. But when the people of Ptolemais\r\nneither received his ambassadors, nor would hear what they had to say,\r\nhe was under a very great concern.\r\n\r\n4. But when Zoilus and the people of Gaza came to him, and desired his\r\nassistance, because their country was laid waste by the Jews, and by\r\nAlexander, Alexander raised the siege, for fear of Ptolemy: and when he\r\nhad drawn off his army into his own country, he used a stratagem\r\nafterwards, by privately inviting Cleopatra to come against Ptolemy, but\r\npublicly pretending to desire a league of friendship and mutual\r\nassistance with him; and promising to give him four hundred talents of\r\nsilver, he desired that, by way of requital, he would take off Zoilus\r\nthe tyrant, and give his country to the Jews. And then indeed Ptolemy,\r\nwith pleasure, made such a league of friendship with Alexander, and\r\nsubdued Zoilus; but when he afterwards heard that he had privily sent to\r\nCleopatra his mother, he broke the league with him, which yet he had\r\nconfirmed with an oath, and fell upon him, and besieged Ptolemais,\r\nbecause it would not receive him. However, leaving his generals, with\r\nsome part of his forces, to go on with the siege, he went himself\r\nimmediately with the rest to lay Judea waste; and when Alexander\r\nunderstood this to be Ptolemy's intention, he also got together about\r\nfifty thousand soldiers out of his own country; nay, as some writers\r\nhave said, eighty thousand 33 He then took his army, and went to meet\r\nPtolemy; but Ptolemy fell upon Asochis, a city of Galilee, and took it\r\nby force on the sabbath day, and there he took about ten thousand\r\nslaves, and a great deal of other prey.\r\n\r\n5. He then tried to take Sepphoris, which was a city not far from that\r\nwhich was destroyed, but lost many of his men; yet did he then go to\r\nfight with Alexander; which Alexander met him at the river Jordan, near\r\na certain place called Saphoth, [not far from the river Jordan,] and\r\npitched his camp near to the enemy. He had however eight thousand in the\r\nfirst rank, which he styled Hecatontomachi, having shields of brass.\r\nThose in the first rank of Ptolemy's soldiers also had shields covered\r\nwith brass. But Ptolemy's soldiers in other respects were inferior to\r\nthose of Alexander, and therefore were more fearful of running hazards;\r\nbut Philostephanus, the camp-master, put great courage into them, and\r\nordered them to pass the river, which was between their camps. Nor did\r\nAlexander think fit to hinder their passage over it; for he thought,\r\nthat if the enemy had once gotten the river on their back, that he\r\nshould the easier take them prisoners, when they could not flee out of\r\nthe battle: in the beginning of which, the acts on both sides, with\r\ntheir hands, and with their alacrity, were alike, and a great slaughter\r\nwas made by both the armies; but Alexander was superior, till\r\nPhilostephanus opportunely brought up the auxiliaries, to help those\r\nthat were giving way; but as there were no auxiliaries to afford help to\r\nthat part of the Jews that gave way, it fell out that they fled, and\r\nthose near them did not assist them, but fled along with them. However,\r\nPtolemy's soldiers acted quite otherwise; for they followed the Jews,\r\nand killed them, till at length those that slew them pursued after them\r\nwhen they had made them all run away, and slew them so long, that their\r\nweapons of iron were blunted, and their hands quite tired with the\r\nslaughter; for the report was, that thirty thousand men were then slain.\r\nTimagenes says they were fifty thousand. As for the rest, they were part\r\nof them taken captives, and the other part ran away to their own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n6. After this victory, Ptolemy overran all the country; and when night\r\ncame on, he abode in certain villages of Judea, which when he found full\r\nof women and children, he commanded his soldiers to strangle them, and\r\nto cut them in pieces, and then to cast them into boiling caldrons, and\r\nthen to devour their limbs as sacrifices. This commandment was given,\r\nthat such as fled from the battle, and came to them, might suppose their\r\nenemies were cannibals, and eat men's flesh, and might on that account\r\nbe still more terrified at them upon such a sight. And both Strabo and\r\nNicholaus [of Damascus] affirm, that they used these people after this\r\nmanner, as I have already related. Ptolemy also took Ptolemais by force,\r\nas we have declared elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. How Alexander, upon the League of Mutual Defense Which\r\nCleopatra Had Agreed with Him, Made an Expedition Against Coelesyria,\r\nand Utterly Overthrew the City of Gaza; and How He Slew Many Ten\r\nThousands of Jews That Rebelled Against Him.\r\n\r\nAlso Concerning Antiochus Grypus, Seleucus Antiochus Cyzicenus, and\r\nAntiochus Pius, and Others.\r\n\r\n1. When Cleopatra saw that her son was grown great, and laid Judea\r\nwaste, without disturbance, and had gotten the city of Gaza under his\r\npower, she resolved no longer to overlook what he did, when he was\r\nalmost at her gates; and she concluded, that now he was so much stronger\r\nthan before, he would be very desirous of the dominion over the\r\nEgyptians; but she immediately marched against him, with a fleet at sea\r\nand an army of foot on land, and made Chelcias and Ananias the Jews\r\ngenerals of her whole army, while she sent the greatest part of her\r\nriches, her grandchildren, and her testament, to the people of Cos 34\r\nCleopatra also ordered her son Alexander to sail with a great fleet to\r\nPhoenicia; and when that country had revolted, she came to Ptolemais;\r\nand because the people of Ptolemais did not receive her, she besieged\r\nthe city; but Ptolemy went out of Syria, and made haste unto Egypt,\r\nsupposing that he should find it destitute of an army, and soon take it,\r\nthough he failed of his hopes. At this time Chelcias, one of Cleopatra's\r\ngenerals, happened to die in Celesyria, as he was in pursuit of Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n2. When Cleopatra heard of her son's attempt, and that his Egyptian\r\nexpedition did not succeed according to his expectations, she sent\r\nthither part of her army, and drove him out of that country; so when he\r\nwas returned out of Egypt again, he abode during the winter at Gaza, in\r\nwhich time Cleopatra took the garrison that was in Ptolemais by siege,\r\nas well as the city; and when Alexander came to her, he gave her\r\npresents, and such marks of respect as were but proper, since under the\r\nmiseries he endured by Ptolemy he had no other refuge but her. Now there\r\nwere some of her friends who persuaded her to seize Alexander, and to\r\noverrun and take possession of the country, and not to sit still and see\r\nsuch a multitude of brave Jews subject to one man. But Ananias's counsel\r\nwas contrary to theirs, who said that she would do an unjust action if\r\nshe deprived a man that was her ally of that authority which belonged to\r\nhim, and this a man who is related to us; \"for [said he] I would not\r\nhave thee ignorant of this, that what in justice thou dost to him will\r\nmake all us that are Jews to be thy enemies.\" This desire of Ananias\r\nCleopatra complied with, and did no injury to Alexander, but made a\r\nleague of mutual assistance with him at Scythopolis, a city of\r\nCelesyria.\r\n\r\n3. So when Alexander was delivered from the fear he was in of Ptolemy,\r\nhe presently made an expedition against Coelesyria. He also took Gadara,\r\nafter a siege of ten months. He took also Areathus, a very strong\r\nfortress belonging to the inhabitants above Jordan, where Theodorus, the\r\nson of Zeno, had his chief treasure, and what he esteemed most precious.\r\nThis Zeno fell unexpectedly upon the Jews, and slew ten thousand of\r\nthem, and seized upon Alexander's baggage. Yet did not this misfortune\r\nterrify Alexander; but he made an expedition upon the maritime parts of\r\nthe country, Raphia and Anthedon, [the name of which king Herod\r\nafterwards changed to Agrippias,] and took even that by force. But when\r\nAlexander saw that Ptolemy was retired from Gaza to Cyprus, and his\r\nmother Cleopatra was returned to Egypt, he grew angry at the people of\r\nGaza, because they had invited Ptolemy to assist them, and besieged\r\ntheir city, and ravaged their country. But as Apollodotus, the general\r\nof the army of Gaza, fell upon the camp of the Jews by night, with two\r\nthousand foreign and ten thousand of his own forces, while the night\r\nlasted, those of Gaza prevailed, because the enemy was made to believe\r\nthat it was Ptolemy who attacked them; but when day was come on, and\r\nthat mistake was corrected, and the Jews knew the truth of the matter,\r\nthey came back again, and fell upon those of Gaza, and slew of them\r\nabout a thousand. But as those of Gaza stoutly resisted them, and would\r\nnot yield for either their want of any thing, nor for the great\r\nmultitude that were slain, [for they would rather suffer any hardship\r\nwhatever than come under the power of their enemies,] Aretas, king of\r\nthe Arabians, a person then very illustrious, encouraged them to go on\r\nwith alacrity, and promised them that he would come to their assistance;\r\nbut it happened that before he came Apollodotus was slain; for his\r\nbrother Lysimachus envying him for the great reputation he had gained\r\namong the citizens, slew him, and got the army together, and delivered\r\nup the city to Alexander, who, when he came in at first, lay quiet, but\r\nafterward set his army upon the inhabitants of Gaza, and gave them leave\r\nto punish them; so some went one way, and some went another, and slew\r\nthe inhabitants of Gaza; yet were not they of cowardly hearts, but\r\nopposed those that came to slay them, and slew as many of the Jews; and\r\nsome of them, when they saw themselves deserted, burnt their own houses,\r\nthat the enemy might get none of their spoils; nay, some of them, with\r\ntheir own hands, slew their children and their wives, having no other\r\nway but this of avoiding slavery for them; but the senators, who were in\r\nall five hundred, fled to Apollo's temple, [for this attack happened to\r\nbe made as they were sitting,] whom Alexander slew; and when he had\r\nutterly overthrown their city, he returned to Jerusalem, having spent a\r\nyear in that siege.\r\n\r\n4. About this very time Antiochus, who was called Grypus, died 35 His\r\ndeath was caused by Heracleon's treachery, when he had lived forty-five\r\nyears, and had reigned twenty-nine. 36 His son Seleucus succeeded him in\r\nthe kingdom, and made war with Antiochus, his father's brother, who was\r\ncalled Antiochus Cyzicenus, and beat him, and took him prisoner, and\r\nslew him. But after a while Antiochus, the son of Cyzicenus, who was\r\ncalled Pius, came to Aradus, and put the diadem on his own head, and\r\nmade war with Seleucus, and beat him, and drove him out of all Syria.\r\nBut when he fled out of Syria, he came to Mopsuestia again, and levied\r\nmoney upon them; but the people of Mopsuestia had indignation at what he\r\ndid, and burnt down his palace, and slew him, together with his friends.\r\nBut when Antiochus, the son of Cyzicenus, was king of Syria, Antiochus,\r\n37 the brother of Seleucus, made war upon him, and was overcome, and\r\ndestroyed, he and his army. After him, his brother Philip put on the\r\ndiadem, and reigned over some part of Syria; but Ptolemy Lathyrus sent\r\nfor his fourth brother Demetrius, who was called Eucerus, from Cnidus,\r\nand made him king of Damascus. Both these brothers did Antiochus\r\nvehemently oppose, but presently died; for when he was come as an\r\nauxiliary to Laodice, queen of the Gileadites, 38 when she was making\r\nwar against the Parthians, and he was fighting courageously, he fell,\r\nwhile Demetrius and Philip governed Syria, as hath been elsewhere\r\nrelated.\r\n\r\n5. As to Alexander, his own people were seditious against him; for at a\r\nfestival which was then celebrated, when he stood upon the altar, and\r\nwas going to sacrifice, the nation rose upon him, and pelted him with\r\ncitrons [which they then had in their hands, because] the law of the\r\nJews required that at the feast of tabernacles every one should have\r\nbranches of the palm tree and citron tree; which thing we have elsewhere\r\nrelated. They also reviled him, as derived from a captive, and so\r\nunworthy of his dignity and of sacrificing. At this he was in a rage,\r\nand slew of them about six thousand. He also built a partition-wall of\r\nwood round the altar and the temple, as far as that partition within\r\nwhich it was only lawful for the priests to enter; and by this means he\r\nobstructed the multitude from coming at him. He also maintained\r\nforeigners of Pisidie and Cilicia; for as to the Syrians, he was at war\r\nwith them, and so made no use of them. He also overcame the Arabians,\r\nsuch as the Moabites and Gileadites, and made them bring tribute.\r\nMoreover, he demolished Amathus, while Theodorus 39 durst not fight with\r\nhim; but as he had joined battle with Obedas, king of the Arabians, and\r\nfell into an ambush in the places that were rugged and difficult to be\r\ntraveled over, he was thrown down into a deep valley, by the multitude\r\nof the camels at Gadurn, a village of Gilead, and hardly escaped with\r\nhis life. From thence he fled to Jerusalem, where, besides his other ill\r\nsuccess, the nation insulted him, and he fought against them for six\r\nyears, and slew no fewer than fifty thousand of them. And when he\r\ndesired that they would desist from their ill-will to him, they hated\r\nhim so much the more, on account of what had already happened; and when\r\nhe had asked them what he ought to do, they all cried out, that he ought\r\nto kill himself. They also sent to Demetrius Eucerus, and desired him to\r\nmake a league of mutual defense with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. How Demetrius Eucerus Overcame Alexander And Yet In A Little\r\nTime Retired Out Of The Country For Fear; As Also How Alexander Slew\r\nMany Of The Jews And Thereby Got Clear Of His Troubles. Concerning The\r\nDeath Of Demetrius.\r\n\r\n1. So Demetrius came with an army, and took those that invited him, and\r\npitched his camp near the city Shechem; upon which Alexander, with his\r\nsix thousand two hundred mercenaries, and about twenty thousand Jews,\r\nwho were of his party, went against Demetrius, who had three thousand\r\nhorsemen, and forty thousand footmen. Now there were great endeavors\r\nused on both sides,—Demetrius trying to bring off the mercenaries that\r\nwere with Alexander, because they were Greeks, and Alexander trying to\r\nbring off the Jews that were with Demetrius. However, when neither of\r\nthem could persuade them so to do, they came to a battle, and Demetrius\r\nwas the conqueror; in which all Alexander's mercenaries were killed,\r\nwhen they had given demonstration of their fidelity and courage. A great\r\nnumber of Demetrius's soldiers were slain also.\r\n\r\n2. Now as Alexander fled to the mountains, six thousand of the Jews\r\nhereupon came together [from Demetrius] to him out of pity at the change\r\nof his fortune; upon which Demetrius was afraid, and retired out of the\r\ncountry; after which the Jews fought against Alexander, and being\r\nbeaten, were slain in great numbers in the several battles which they\r\nhad; and when he had shut up the most powerful of them in the city\r\nBethome, he besieged them therein; and when he had taken the city, and\r\ngotten the men into his power, he brought them to Jerusalem, and did one\r\nof the most barbarous actions in the world to them; for as he was\r\nfeasting with his concubines, in the sight of all the city, he ordered\r\nabout eight hundred of them to be crucified; and while they were living,\r\nhe ordered the throats of their children and wives to be cut before\r\ntheir eyes. This was indeed by way of revenge for the injuries they had\r\ndone him; which punishment yet was of an inhuman nature, though we\r\nsuppose that he had been never so much distressed, as indeed he had\r\nbeen, by his wars with them, for he had by their means come to the last\r\ndegree of hazard, both of his life and of his kingdom, while they were\r\nnot satisfied by themselves only to fight against him, but introduced\r\nforeigners also for the same purpose; nay, at length they reduced him to\r\nthat degree of necessity, that he was forced to deliver back to the king\r\nof Arabia the land of Moab and Gilead, which he had subdued, and the\r\nplaces that were in them, that they might not join with them in the war\r\nagainst him, as they had done ten thousand other things that tended to\r\naffront and reproach him. However, this barbarity seems to have been\r\nwithout any necessity, on which account he bare the name of a Thracian\r\namong the Jews 40 whereupon the soldiers that had fought against him,\r\nbeing about eight thousand in number, ran away by night, and continued\r\nfugitives all the time that Alexander lived; who being now freed from\r\nany further disturbance from them, reigned the rest of his time in the\r\nutmost tranquillity.\r\n\r\n3. But when Demetrius was departed out of Judea, he went to Berea, and\r\nbesieged his brother Philip, having with him ten thousand footmen, and a\r\nthousand horsemen. However Strato, the tyrant of Berea, the confederate\r\nof Philip, called in Zizon, the ruler of the Arabian tribes, and\r\nMithridates Sinax, the ruler of the Parthians, who coming with a great\r\nnumber of forces, and besieging Demetrius in his encampment, into which\r\nthey had driven them with their arrows, they compelled those that were\r\nwith him by thirst to deliver up themselves. So they took a great many\r\nspoils out of that country, and Demetrius himself, whom they sent to\r\nMithridates, who was then king of Parthia; but as to those whom they\r\ntook captives of the people of Antioch, they restored them to the\r\nAntiochinus without any reward. Now Mithridates, the king of Parthia,\r\nhad Demetrius in great honor, till Demetrius ended his life by sickness.\r\nSo Philip, presently after the fight was over, came to Antioch, and took\r\nit, and reigned over Syria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15. How Antiochus, Who Was Called Dionysus, And After Him Aretas\r\nMade Expeditions Into Judea; As Also How Alexander Took Many Cities And\r\nThen Returned To Jerusalem, And After A Sickness Of Three Years Died;\r\nAnd What Counsel He Gave To Alexandra.\r\n\r\n1. After this, Antiochus, who was called Dionysus, 41 and was Philip's\r\nbrother, aspired to the dominion, and came to Damascus, and got the\r\npower into his hands, and there he reigned; but as he was making war\r\nagainst the Arabians, his brother Philip heard of it, and came to\r\nDamascus, where Milesius, who had been left governor of the citadel, and\r\nthe Damascens themselves, delivered up the city to him; yet because\r\nPhilip was become ungrateful to him, and had bestowed upon him nothing\r\nof that in hopes whereof he had received him into the city, but had a\r\nmind to have it believed that it was rather delivered up out of fear\r\nthan by the kindness of Milesius, and because he had not rewarded him as\r\nhe ought to have done, he became suspected by him, and so he was obliged\r\nto leave Damascus again; for Milesius caught him marching out into the\r\nHippodrome, and shut him up in it, and kept Damascus for Antiochus\r\n[Eucerus], who hearing how Philip's affairs stood, came back out of\r\nArabia. He also came immediately, and made an expedition against Judea,\r\nwith eight thousand armed footmen, and eight hundred horsemen. So\r\nAlexander, out of fear of his coming, dug a deep ditch, beginning at\r\nChabarzaba, which is now called Antipatris, to the sea of Joppa, on\r\nwhich part only his army could be brought against him. He also raised a\r\nwall, and erected wooden towers, and intermediate redoubts, for one\r\nhundred and fifty furlongs in length, and there expected the coming of\r\nAntiochus; but he soon burnt them all, and made his army pass by that\r\nway into Arabia. The Arabian king [Aretas] at first retreated, but\r\nafterward appeared on the sudden with ten thousand horsemen. Antiochus\r\ngave them the meeting, and fought desperately; and indeed when he had\r\ngotten the victory, and was bringing some auxiliaries to that part of\r\nhis army that was in distress, he was slain. When Antiochus was fallen,\r\nhis army fled to the village Cana, where the greatest part of them\r\nperished by famine.\r\n\r\n2. After him 42 Arems reigned over Celesyria, being called to the\r\ngovernment by those that held Damascus, by reason of the hatred they\r\nbare to Ptolemy Menneus. He also made thence an expedition against\r\nJudea, and beat Alexander in battle, near a place called Adida; yet did\r\nhe, upon certain conditions agreed on between them, retire out of Judea.\r\n\r\n3. But Alexander marched again to the city Dios, and took it; and then\r\nmade an expedition against Essa, where was the best part of Zeno's\r\ntreasures, and there he encompassed the place with three walls; and when\r\nhe had taken the city by fighting, he marched to Golan and Seleucia; and\r\nwhen he had taken these cities, he, besides them, took that valley which\r\nis called The Valley of Antiochus, as also the fortress of Gamala. He\r\nalso accused Demetrius, who was governor of those places, of many\r\ncrimes, and turned him out; and after he had spent three years in this\r\nwar, he returned to his own country, when the Jews joyfully received him\r\nupon this his good success.\r\n\r\n4. Now at this time the Jews were in possession of the following cities\r\nthat had belonged to the Syrians, and Idumeans, and Phoenicians: At the\r\nsea-side, Strato's Tower, Apollonia, Joppa, Jamhis, Ashdod, Gaza,\r\nAnthedon, Raphia, and Rhinocolura; in the middle of the country, near to\r\nIdumea, Adorn, and Marissa; near the country of Samaria, Mount Carmel,\r\nand Mount Tabor, Scythopolis, and Gadara; of the country of Gaulonitis,\r\nSeleucia and Gabala; in the country of Moab, Heshbon, and Medaba, Lemba,\r\nand Oronas, Gelithon, Zorn, the valley of the Cilices, and Pollo; which\r\nlast they utterly destroyed, because its inhabitants would not bear to\r\nchange their religious rites for those peculiar to the Jews. 43 The Jews\r\nalso possessed others of the principal cities of Syria, which had been\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n5. After this, king Alexander, although he fell into a distemper by hard\r\ndrinking, and had a quartan ague, which held him three years, yet would\r\nnot leave off going out with his army, till he was quite spent with the\r\nlabors he had undergone, and died in the bounds of Ragaba, a fortress\r\nbeyond Jordan. But when his queen saw that he was ready to die, and had\r\nno longer any hopes of surviving, she came to him weeping and lamenting,\r\nand bewailed herself and her sons on the desolate condition they should\r\nbe left in; and said to him, \"To whom dost thou thus leave me and my\r\nchildren, who are destitute of all other supports, and this when thou\r\nknowest how much ill-will thy nation bears thee?\" But he gave her the\r\nfollowing advice: That she need but follow what he would suggest to her,\r\nin order to retain the kingdom securely, with her children: that she\r\nshould conceal his death from the soldiers till she should have taken\r\nthat place; after this she should go in triumph, as upon a victory, to\r\nJerusalem, and put some of her authority into the hands of the\r\nPharisees; for that they would commend her for the honor she had done\r\nthem, and would reconcile the nation to her for he told her they had\r\ngreat authority among the Jews, both to do hurt to such as they hated,\r\nand to bring advantages to those to whom they were friendly disposed;\r\nfor that they are then believed best of all by the multitude when they\r\nspeak any severe thing against others, though it be only out of envy at\r\nthem. And he said that it was by their means that he had incurred the\r\ndispleasure of the nation, whom indeed he had injured. \"Do thou,\r\ntherefore,\" said he, \"when thou art come to Jerusalem, send for the\r\nleading men among them, and show them my body, and with great appearance\r\nof sincerity, give them leave to use it as they themselves please,\r\nwhether they will dishonor the dead body by refusing it burial, as\r\nhaving severely suffered by my means, or whether in their anger they\r\nwill offer any other injury to that body. Promise them also that thou\r\nwilt do nothing without them in the affairs of the kingdom. If thou dost\r\nbut say this to them, I shall have the honor of a more glorious Funeral\r\nfrom them than thou couldst have made for me; and when it is in their\r\npower to abuse my dead body, they will do it no injury at all, and thou\r\nwilt rule in safety.\" 44 So when he had given his wife this advice, he\r\ndied, after he had reigned twenty-seven years, and lived fifty years\r\nwithin one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16. How Alexandra By Gaining The Good-Will Of The Pharisees,\r\nRetained The Kingdom Nine Years, And Then, Having Done Many Glorious\r\nActions Died.\r\n\r\n1. So Alexandra, when she had taken the fortress, acted as her husband\r\nhad suggested to her, and spake to the Pharisees, and put all things\r\ninto their power, both as to the dead body, and as to the affairs of the\r\nkingdom, and thereby pacified their anger against Alexander, and made\r\nthem bear goodwill and friendship to him; who then came among the\r\nmultitude, and made speeches to them, and laid before them the actions\r\nof Alexander, and told them that they had lost a righteous king; and by\r\nthe commendation they gave him, they brought them to grieve, and to be\r\nin heaviness for him, so that he had a funeral more splendid than had\r\nany of the kings before him. Alexander left behind him two sons,\r\nHyrcanus and Aristobulus, but committed the kingdom to Alexandra. Now,\r\nas to these two sons, Hyrcanus was indeed unable to manage public\r\naffairs, and delighted rather in a quiet life; but the younger,\r\nAristobulus, was an active and a bold man; and for this woman herself,\r\nAlexandra, she was loved by the multitude, because she seemed displeased\r\nat the offenses her husband had been guilty of.\r\n\r\n2. So she made Hyrcanus high priest, because he was the elder, but much\r\nmore because he cared not to meddle with politics, and permitted the\r\nPharisees to do every thing; to whom also she ordered the multitude to\r\nbe obedient. She also restored again those practices which the Pharisees\r\nhad introduced, according to the traditions of their forefathers, and\r\nwhich her father-in-law, Hyrcanus, had abrogated. So she had indeed the\r\nname of the regent, but the Pharisees had the authority; for it was they\r\nwho restored such as had been banished, and set such as were prisoners\r\nat liberty, and, to say all at once, they differed in nothing from\r\nlords. However, the queen also took care of the affairs of the kingdom,\r\nand got together a great body of mercenary soldiers, and increased her\r\nown army to such a degree, that she became terrible to the neighboring\r\ntyrants, and took hostages of them: and the country was entirely at\r\npeace, excepting the Pharisees; for they disturbed the queen, and\r\ndesired that she would kill those who persuaded Alexander to slay the\r\neight hundred men; after which they cut the throat of one of them,\r\nDiogenes; and after him they did the same to several, one after another,\r\ntill the men that were the most potent came into the palace, and\r\nAristobulus with them, for he seemed to be displeased at what was done;\r\nand it appeared openly, that if he had an opportunity, he would not\r\npermit his mother to go on so. These put the queen in mind what great\r\ndangers they had gone through, and great things they had done, whereby\r\nthey had demonstrated the firmness of their fidelity to their master,\r\ninsomuch that they had received the greatest marks of favor from him;\r\nand they begged of her, that she would not utterly blast their hopes, as\r\nit now happened, that when they had escaped the hazards that arose from\r\ntheir [open] enemies, they were to be cut off at home by their [private]\r\nenemies, like brute beasts, without any help whatsoever. They said also,\r\nthat if their adversaries would be satisfied with those that had been\r\nslain already, they would take what had been done patiently, on account\r\nof their natural love to their governors; but if they must expect the\r\nsame for the future also, they implored of her a dismission from her\r\nservice; for they could not bear to think of attempting any method for\r\ntheir deliverance without her, but would rather die willingly before the\r\npalace gate, in case she would not forgive them. And that it was a great\r\nshame, both for themselves and for the queen, that when they were\r\nneglected by her, they should come under the lash of her husband's\r\nenemies; for that Aretas, the Arabian king, and the monarchs, would give\r\nany reward, if they could get such men as foreign auxiliaries, to whom\r\ntheir very names, before their voices be heard, may perhaps be terrible;\r\nbut if they could not obtain this their second request, and if she had\r\ndetermined to prefer the Pharisees before them, they still insisted that\r\nshe would place them every one in her fortresses; for if some fatal\r\ndemon hath a constant spite against Alexander's house, they would be\r\nwilling to bear their part, and to live in a private station there.\r\n\r\n3. As these men said thus, and called upon Alexander's ghost for\r\ncommiseration of those already slain, and those in danger of it, all the\r\nbystanders brake out into tears. But Aristobulus chiefly made manifest\r\nwhat were his sentiments, and used many reproachful expressions to his\r\nmother, [saying,] \"Nay, indeed, the case is this, that they have been\r\nthemselves the authors of their own calamities, who have permitted a\r\nwoman who, against reason, was mad with ambition, to reign over them,\r\nwhen there were sons in the flower of their age fitter for it.\" So\r\nAlexandra, not knowing what to do with any decency, committed the\r\nfortresses to them, all but Hyrcania, and Alexandrium, and Macherus,\r\nwhere her principal treasures were. After a little while also, she sent\r\nher son Aristobulus with an army to Damascus against Ptolemy, who was\r\ncalled Menneus, who was such a bad neighbor to the city; but he did\r\nnothing considerable there, and so returned home.\r\n\r\n4. About this time news was brought that Tigranes, the king of Armenia,\r\nhad made an irruption into Syria with five hundred thousand soldiers, 45\r\nand was coming against Judea. This news, as may well be supposed,\r\nterrified the queen and the nation. Accordingly, they sent him many and\r\nvery valuable presents, as also ambassadors, and that as he was\r\nbesieging Ptolemais; for Selene the queen, the same that was also called\r\nCleopatra, ruled then over Syria, who had persuaded the inhabitants to\r\nexclude Tigranes. So the Jewish ambassadors interceded with him, and\r\nentreated him that he would determine nothing that was severe about\r\ntheir queen or nation. He commended them for the respects they paid him\r\nat so great a distance, and gave them good hopes of his favor. But as\r\nsoon as Ptolemais was taken, news came to Tigranes, that Lucullus, in\r\nhis pursuit of Mithridates, could not light upon him, who was fled into\r\nIberia, but was laying waste Armenia, and besieging its cities. Now when\r\nTigranes knew this, he returned home.\r\n\r\n5. After this, when the queen was fallen into a dangerous distemper,\r\nAristobulus resolved to attempt the seizing of the government; so he\r\nstole away secretly by night, with only one of his servants, and went to\r\nthe fortresses, wherein his friends, that were such from the days of his\r\nfather, were settled; for as he had been a great while displeased at his\r\nmother's conduct, so he was now much more afraid, lest, upon her death,\r\ntheir whole family should be under the power of the Pharisees; for he\r\nsaw the inability of his brother, who was to succeed in the government;\r\nnor was any one conscious of what he was doing but only his wife, whom\r\nhe left at Jerusalem with their children. He first of all came to Agaba,\r\nwhere was Galestes, one of the potent men before mentioned, and was\r\nreceived by him. When it was day, the queen perceived that Aristobulus\r\nwas fled; and for some time she supposed that his departure was not in\r\norder to make any innovation; but when messengers came one after another\r\nwith the news that he had secured the first place, the second place, and\r\nall the places, for as soon as one had begun they all submitted to his\r\ndisposal, then it was that the queen and the nation were in the greatest\r\ndisorder, for they were aware that it would not be long ere Aristobulus\r\nwould be able to settle himself firmly in the government. What they were\r\nprincipally afraid of was this, that he would inflict punishment upon\r\nthem for the mad treatment his house had had from them. So they resolved\r\nto take his wife and children into custody, and keep them in the\r\nfortress that was over the temple. 46 Now there was a mighty conflux of\r\npeople that came to Aristobulus from all parts, insomuch that he had a\r\nkind of royal attendants about him; for in a little more than fifteen\r\ndays he got twenty-two strong places, which gave him the opportunity of\r\nraising an army from Libanus and Trachonitis, and the monarchs; for men\r\nare easily led by the greater number, and easily submit to them. And\r\nbesides this, that by affording him their assistance, when he could not\r\nexpect it, they, as well as he, should have the advantages that would\r\ncome by his being king, because they had been the occasion of his\r\ngaining the kingdom. Now the elders of the Jews, and Hyrcanus with them,\r\nwent in unto the queen, and desired that she would give them her\r\nsentiments about the present posture of affairs, for that Aristobulus\r\nwas in effect lord of almost all the kingdom, by possessing of so many\r\nstrong holds, and that it was absurd for them to take any counsel by\r\nthemselves, how ill soever she were, whilst she was alive, and that the\r\ndanger would be upon them in no long time. But she bid them do what they\r\nthought proper to be done; that they had many circumstances in their\r\nfavor still remaining, a nation in good heart, an army, and money in\r\ntheir several treasuries; for that she had small concern about public\r\naffairs now, when the strength of her body already failed her.\r\n\r\n6. Now a little while after she had said this to them, she died, when\r\nshe had reigned nine years, and had in all lived seventy-three. A woman\r\nshe was who showed no signs of the weakness of her sex, for she was\r\nsagacious to the greatest degree in her ambition of governing; and\r\ndemonstrated by her doings at once, that her mind was fit for action,\r\nand that sometimes men themselves show the little understanding they\r\nhave by the frequent mistakes they make in point of government; for she\r\nalways preferred the present to futurity, and preferred the power of an\r\nimperious dominion above all things, and in comparison of that had no\r\nregard to what was good, or what was right. However, she brought the\r\naffairs of her house to such an unfortunate condition, that she was the\r\noccasion of the taking away that authority from it, and that in no long\r\ntime afterward, which she had obtained by a vast number of hazards and\r\nmisfortunes, and this out of a desire of what does not belong to a\r\nwoman, and all by a compliance in her sentiments with those that bare\r\nill-will to their family, and by leaving the administration destitute of\r\na proper support of great men; and, indeed, her management during her\r\nadministration while she was alive, was such as filled the palace after\r\nher death with calamities and disturbance. However, although this had\r\nbeen her way of governing, she preserved the nation in peace. And this\r\nis the conclusion of the affairs of, Alexandra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ This Alexander Bala, who certainly pretended to be the son\r\nof Antiochus Epiphanes, and was owned for such by the Jews and Romans,\r\nand many others, and yet is by several historians deemed to be a\r\ncounterfeit, and of no family at all, is, however, by Josephus believed\r\nto have been the real son of that Antiochus, and by him always spoken of\r\naccordingly. And truly, since the original contemporary and authentic\r\nauthor of the First Book of Maccabees [10:1: calls him by his father's\r\nname, Epiphanes, and says he was the son of Antiochus, I suppose the\r\nother writers, who are all much later, are not to be followed against\r\nsuch evidence, though perhaps Epiphanes might have him by a woman of no\r\nfamily. The king of Egypt also, Philometor, soon gave him his daughter\r\nin marriage, which he would hardly have done, had he believed him to be\r\na counterfeit, and of so very mean a birth as the later historians\r\npretend.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ Since Jonathan plainly did not put on the pontifical robes\r\ntill seven or eight years after the death of his brother Judas, or not\r\ntill the feast of tabernacles, in the 160th of the Seleucidm, 1 Macc.\r\n10;21, Petitus's emendation seems here to deserve consideration, who,\r\ninstead of \"after four years since the death of his brother Judas,\"\r\nwould have us read, \"and therefore after eight years since the death of\r\nhis brother Judas.\" This would tolerably well agree with the date of the\r\nMaccabees, and with Josephus's own exact chronology at the end of the\r\ntwentieth book of these Antiquities, which the present text cannot be\r\nmade to do.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ Take Grotius's note here: \"The Jews,\" says he, \"were wont\r\nto present crowns to the kings [of Syria]; afterwards that gold which\r\nwas paid instead of those crowns, or which was expended in making them,\r\nwas called the crown gold and crown tax.\" On 1 Macc. 10:29.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ Since the rest of the historians now extant give this\r\nDemetrius thirteen years, and Josephus only eleven years, Dean Prideaux\r\ndoes not amiss in ascribing to him the mean number twelve.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 (return) [ It seems to me contrary to the opinion of Josephus, and of\r\nthe moderns, both Jews and Christians, that this prophecy of Isaiah,\r\n19:19, etc., \"In that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the\r\nmidst of the land of Egypt,\" etc., directly foretold the building of\r\nthis temple of Onias in Egypt, and was a sufficient warrant to the Jews\r\nfor building it, and for worshipping the true God, the God of Israel,\r\ntherein. See Authent. Rec. 11. p. 755. That God seems to have soon\r\nbetter accepted of the sacrifices and prayers here offered him than\r\nthose at Jerusalem, see the note on ch. 10. sect. 7. And truly the marks\r\nof Jewish corruption or interpolation in this text, in order to\r\ndiscourage their people from approving of the Worship of God here, are\r\nvery strong, and highly deserve our consideration and correction. The\r\nforegoing verse in Isaiah runs thus in our common copies, \"In that day\r\nshall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan,\"\r\n[the Hebrew language; shall be full of Jews, whose sacred books were in\r\nHebrew,] \"and swear to the Lord of hosts; one\" [or the first] \"shall be\r\ncalled, The City of Destruction,\" Isaiah 19:18. A strange-name, \"City of\r\nDestruction,\" upon so joyful occasion, and a name never heard of in the\r\nland of Egypt, or perhaps in any other nation. The old reading was\r\nevidently the City of the Sun, or Heliopolis; and Unkelos, in effect,\r\nand Symmachus, with the Arabic version, entirely confess that to be the\r\ntrue reading. The Septuagint also, though they have the text disguised\r\nin the common copies, and call it Asedek, the City of Righteousness; yet\r\nin two or three other copies the Hebrew word itself for the Sun,\r\nAchares, or Thares, is preserved. And since Onias insists with the king\r\nand queen, that Isaiah's prophecy contained many other predictions\r\nrelating to this place besides the words by him recited, it is highly\r\nprobable that these were especially meant by him; and that one main\r\nreason why he applied this prediction to himself, and to his prefecture\r\nof Heliopolis, which Dean Prideaux well proves was in that part of\r\nEgypt, and why he chose to build in that prefecture of Heliopolis,\r\nthough otherwise an improper place, was this, that the same authority\r\nthat he had for building this temple in Egypt, the very same he had for\r\nbuilding it in his own prefecture of Heliopolis also, which he desired\r\nto do, and which he did accordingly. Dean Prideaux has much ado to avoid\r\nseeing this corruption of the Hebrew; but it being in support of his own\r\nopinion about this temple, he durst not see it; and indeed he reasons\r\nhere in the most injudicious manner possible. See him at the year 149.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 (return) [ A very unfair disputation this! while the Jewish disputant,\r\nknowing that he could not properly prove out of the Pentateuch, that\r\n\"the place which the Lord their God shall choose to place his name\r\nthere,\" so often referred to in the Book of Deuteronomy, was Jerusalem\r\nany more than Gerizzim, that being not determined till the days of\r\nDavid, Antiq. B. VII. ch. 13. sect. 4, proves only, what the Samaritans\r\ndid not deny, that the temple at Jerusalem was much more ancient, and\r\nmuch more celebrated and honored, than that at Gerizzim, which was\r\nnothing to the present purpose. The whole evidence, by the very oaths of\r\nboth parties, being, we see, obliged to be confined to the law of Moses,\r\nor to the Pentateuch alone. However, worldly policy and interest and the\r\nmultitude prevailing, the court gave sentence, as usual, on the stronger\r\nside, and poor Sabbeus and Theodosius, the Samaritan disputants, were\r\nmartyred, and this, so far as appears, without any direct hearing at\r\nall, which is like the usual practice of such political courts about\r\nmatters of religion. Our copies say that the body of the Jews were in a\r\ngreat concern about those men [in the plural] who were to dispute for\r\ntheir temple at Jerusalem, whereas it seems here they had but one\r\ndisputant, Andronicus by name. Perhaps more were prepared to speak on\r\nthe Jews' side; but the firstraying answered to his name, and overcome\r\nthe Samaritans, there was necessity for any other defender of the\r\nJerusalem temple.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 (return) [ Of the several Apollonius about these ages, see Dean\r\nPrideaux at the year 148.

XVIII. ch. 1. sect. 3, as if he sometimes\r\nsaid they introduced an absolute fatality, and denied all freedom of\r\nhuman actions, is almost wholly groundless if he ever, as the very\r\nlearned Casaubon here truly observes, asserting, that the Pharisees were\r\nbetween the Essens and Sadducees, and did so far ascribe all to fate or\r\nDivine Providence as was consistent with the freedom of human actions.\r\nHowever, their perplexed way of talking about fate, or Providence, as\r\noverruling all things, made it commonly thought they were willing to\r\nexcuse their sins by ascribing them to fate, as in the Apostolical\r\nConstitutions, B. VI. ch. 6. Perhaps under the same general name some\r\ndifference of opinions in this point might be propagated, as is very\r\ncommon in all parties, especially in points of metaphysical subtilty.\r\nHowever, our Josephus, who in his heart was a great admirer of the piety\r\nof the Essens, was yet in practice a Pharisee, as he himself informs us,\r\nin his own Life, sect. 2. And his account of this doctrine of the\r\nPharisees is for certain agreeable to his own opinion, who ever both\r\nfully allowed the freedom of human actions, and yet strongly believed\r\nthe powerful interposition of Divine Providence.

What few things there are afterward\r\ncommon to both, might probably be learned by him from some other more\r\nimperfect records. However, we must exactly observe here, what the\r\nremaining part of that book of the Maccabees informs us of, and what\r\nJosephus would never have omitted, had his copy contained so much, that\r\nthis Simon the Great, the Maccabee, made a league with Antiochus Soter,\r\nthe son of Demetrius Soter, and brother of the other Demetrius, who was\r\nnow a captive in Parthia: that upon his coming to the crown, about the\r\n140th year before the Christian sets, he granted great privileges to the\r\nJewish nation, and to Simon their high priest and ethnarch; which\r\nprivileges Simon seems to have taken of his own accord about three years\r\nbefore. In particular, he gave him leave to coin money for his country\r\nwith his own stamp; and as concerning Jerusalem and the sanctuary, that\r\nthey should be free, or, as the vulgar Latin hath it, \"holy and free,\" 1\r\nMacc. 15:6, 7, which I take to be the truer reading, as being the very\r\nwords of his father's concession offered to Jonathan several years\r\nbefore, ch. 10:31; and Antiq. B, XIII. ch. 2. sect. 3. Now what makes\r\nthis date and these grants greatly remarkable, is the state of the\r\nremaining genuine shekels of the Jews with Samaritan characters, which\r\nseem to have been [most of them at least] coined in the first four years\r\nof this Simon the Asamonean, and having upon them these words on one\r\nside, \"Jerusalem the Holy;\" and on the reverse, \"In the Year of\r\nFreedom,\" 1, or 2, or 3, or 4; which shekels therefore are original\r\nmonuments of these times, and undeniable marks of the truth of the\r\nhistory in these chapters, though it be in great measure omitted by\r\nJosephus. See Essay on the Old Test. p. 157, 158.

And indeed,\r\nif we may judge from the very different characters of the Egyptian Jews\r\nunder high priests, and of the Palestine Jews under kings, in the two\r\nnext centuries, we may well suppose that the Divine Shechinah was\r\nremoved into Egypt, and that the worshippers at the temple of Onias were\r\nbetter men than those at the temple of Jerusalem.]\r\n\r\n\r\n31 (return) [ Hence we learn that the Essens pretended to have ruled\r\nwhereby men might foretell things to come, and that this Judas the Essen\r\ntaught those rules to his scholars; but whether their pretense were of\r\nan astrological or magical nature, which yet in such religious Jews, who\r\nwere utterly forbidden such arts, is no way probable, or to any Bath\r\nCol, spoken of by the later Rabbins, or otherwise, I cannot tell.

II. ch. 8. sect. 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\n32 (return) [ The reason why Hyrcanus suffered not this son of his whom\r\nhe did not love to come into Judea, but ordered him to be brought up in\r\nGalilee, is suggested by Dr. Hudson, that Galilee was not esteemed so\r\nhappy and well cultivated a country as Judea, Matthew 26:73; John 7:52;\r\nActs 2:7, although another obvious reason occurs also, that he was out\r\nof his sight in Galilee than he would have been in Judea.]\r\n\r\n\r\n33 (return) [ From these, and other occasional expressions, dropped by\r\nJosephus, we may learn, that where the sacred hooks of the Jews were\r\ndeficient, he had several other histories then extant, [but now most of\r\nthem lost,] which he faithfully followed in his own history; nor indeed\r\nhave we any other records of those times, relating to Judea, that can be\r\ncompared to these accounts of Josephus, though when we do meet with\r\nauthentic fragments of such original records, they almost always confirm\r\nhis history.]\r\n\r\n\r\n34 (return) [ This city, or island, Cos, is not that remote island in\r\nthe Aegean Sea, famous for the birth of the great Hippocrates, but a\r\ncity or island of the same name adjoining to Egypt, mentioned both by\r\nStephanus and Ptolemy, as Dr. Mizon informs us. Of which Cos, and the\r\ntreasures there laid up by Cleopatra and the Jews, see Antiq. B. XIV.\r\nch. 7, sect. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n35 (return) [ This account of the death of Antiochus Grypus is confirmed\r\nby Appion, Syriac. p. 132, here cited by Spanheim.]\r\n\r\n\r\n36 (return) [ Porphyry says that this Antiochus Grypus reigned but\r\ntwenty-six years, as Dr. Hudson observes.

That excellent prince, John Hyrcanus, did it to the Idumeans, as\r\nI have noted on ch. 9. sect. 1, already, who lived then in the Promised\r\nLand, and this I suppose justly; but by what right the rest did it, even\r\nto the countries or cities that were no part of that land, I do not at\r\nall know. This looks too like unjust persecution for religion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n44 (return) [ It seems, by this dying advice of Alexander Janneus to his\r\nwife, that he had himself pursued the measures of his father Hyrcanus\r\nand taken part with the Sadducees, who kept close to the written law,\r\nagainst the Pharisees, who had introduced their own traditions, ch. 16.\r\nsect. 2; and that he now saw a political necessity of submitting to the\r\nPharisees and their traditions hereafter, if his widow and family minded\r\nto retain their monarchical government or tyranny over the Jewish\r\nnation; which sect yet, thus supported, were at last in a great measure\r\nthe ruin of the religion, government, and nation of the Jews, and\r\nbrought them into so wicked a state, that the vengeance of God came upon\r\nthem to their utter excision. Just thus did Caiaphas politically advise\r\nthe Jewish sanhedrim, John 11:50, \"That it was expedient for them that\r\none man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish\r\nnot;\" and this in consequence of their own political supposal, ver. 48,\r\nthat, \"If they let Jesus alone,\" with his miracles, \"all men would\r\nbelieve on him, and the Romans would come and take away both their place\r\nand nation.\" Which political crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth brought\r\ndown the vengeance of God upon them, and occasioned those very Romans,\r\nof whom they seemed so much afraid, that to prevent it they put him to\r\ndeath, actually to \"come and take away both their place and nation\"\r\nwithin thirty-eight years afterwards. I heartily wish the politicians of\r\nChristendom would consider these and the like examples, and no longer\r\nsacrifice all virtue and religion to their pernicious schemes of\r\ngovernment, to the bringing down the judgments of God upon themselves,\r\nand the several nations intrusted to their care. But this is a\r\ndigression. I wish it were an unseasonable one also.

Containing The Interval Of Thirty-Two Years.—From The Death Of\r\nQueen Alexandra To The Death Of Antigonus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. The War Between Aristobulus And Hyrcanus About The Kingdom;\r\nAnd How They Made Anagreement That Aristobulus Should Be King, And\r\nHyrcanus Live A Private Life; As Also How Hyrcanus A Little Afterward\r\nWas Persuaded By Antipater To Fly To Aretas.\r\n\r\n1. We have related the affairs of queen Alexandra, and her death, in the\r\nforegoing book and will now speak of what followed, and was connected\r\nwith those histories; declaring, before we proceed, that we have nothing\r\nso much at heart as this, that we may omit no facts, either through\r\nignorance or laziness; 1 for we are upon the history and explication of\r\nsuch things as the greatest part are unacquainted withal, because of\r\ntheir distance from our times; and we aim to do it with a proper beauty\r\nof style, so far as that is derived from proper words harmonically\r\ndisposed, and from such ornaments of speech also as may contribute to\r\nthe pleasure of our readers, that they may entertain the knowledge of\r\nwhat we write with some agreeable satisfaction and pleasure. But the\r\nprincipal scope that authors ought to aim at above all the rest, is to\r\nspeak accurately, and to speak truly, for the satisfaction of those that\r\nare otherwise unacquainted with such transactions, and obliged to\r\nbelieve what these writers inform them of.\r\n\r\n2. Hyrcanus then began his high priesthood on the third year of the\r\nhundred and seventy-seventh olympiad, when Quintus Hortensius and\r\nQuintus Metellus, who was called Metellus of Crete, were consuls at\r\nRome; when presently Aristobulus began to make war against him; and as\r\nit came to a battle with Hyrcanus at Jericho, many of his soldiers\r\ndeserted him, and went over to his brother; upon which Hyrcanus fled\r\ninto the citadel, where Aristobulus's wife and children were imprisoned\r\nby their mother, as we have said already, and attacked and overcame\r\nthose his adversaries that had fled thither, and lay within the walls of\r\nthe temple. So when he had sent a message to his brother about agreeing\r\nthe matters between them, he laid aside his enmity to him on these\r\nconditions, that Aristobulus should be king, that he should live without\r\nintermeddling with public affairs, and quietly enjoy the estate he had\r\nacquired. When they had agreed upon these terms in the temple, and had\r\nconfirmed the agreement with oaths, and the giving one another their\r\nright hands, and embracing one another in the sight of the whole\r\nmultitude, they departed; the one, Aristobulus, to the palace; and\r\nHyrcanus, as a private man, to the former house of Aristobulus.\r\n\r\n3. But there was a certain friend of Hyrcanus, an Idumean, called\r\nAntipater, who was very rich, and in his nature an active and a\r\nseditious man; who was at enmity with Aristobulus, and had differences\r\nwith him on account of his good-will to Hyrcanus. It is true that\r\nNicolaus of Damascus says, that Antipater was of the stock of the\r\nprincipal Jews who came out of Babylon into Judea; but that assertion of\r\nhis was to gratify Herod, who was his son, and who, by certain\r\nrevolutions of fortune, came afterward to be king of the Jews, whose\r\nhistory we shall give you in its proper place hereafter. However, this\r\nAntipater was at first called Antipas, 2 and that was his father's name\r\nalso; of whom they relate this: That king Alexander and his wife made\r\nhim general of all Idumea, and that he made a league of friendship with\r\nthose Arabians, and Gazites, and Ascalonites, that were of his own\r\nparty, and had, by many and large presents, made them his fast friends.\r\nBut now this younger Antipater was suspicious of the power of\r\nAristobulus, and was afraid of some mischief he might do him, because of\r\nhis hatred to him; so he stirred up the most powerful of the Jews, and\r\ntalked against him to them privately; and said that it was unjust to\r\noverlook the conduct of Aristobulus, who had gotten the government\r\nunrighteously, and ejected his brother out of it, who was the elder, and\r\nought to retain what belonged to him by prerogative of his birth. And\r\nthe same speeches he perpetually made to Hyrcanus; and told him that his\r\nown life would be in danger, unless he guarded himself, and got shut of\r\nAristobulus; for he said that the friends of Aristobulus omitted no\r\nopportunity of advising him to kill him, as being then, and not before,\r\nsure to retain his principality. Hyrcanus gave no credit to these words\r\nof his, as being of a gentle disposition, and one that did not easily\r\nadmit of calumnies against other men. This temper of his not disposing\r\nhim to meddle with public affairs, and want of spirit, occasioned him to\r\nappear to spectators to be degenerous and unmanly; while. Aristobulus\r\nwas of a contrary temper, an active man, and one of a great and generous\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n4. Since therefore Antipater saw that Hyrcanus did not attend to what he\r\nsaid, he never ceased, day by day, to charge reigned crimes upon\r\nAristobulus, and to calumniate him before him, as if he had a mind to\r\nkill him; and so, by urging him perpetually, he advised him, and\r\npersuaded him to fly to Aretas, the king of Arabia; and promised, that\r\nif he would comply with his advice, he would also himself assist him and\r\ngo with him. When Hyrcanus heard this, he said that it was for his\r\nadvantage to fly away to Aretas. Now Arabia is a country that borders\r\nupon Judea. However, Hyrcanus sent Antipater first to the king of\r\nArabia, in order to receive assurances from him, that when he should\r\ncome in the manner of a supplicant to him, he would not deliver him up\r\nto his enemies. So Antipater having received such assurances, returned\r\nto Hyrcanus to Jerusalem. A while afterward he took Hyrcanus, and stole\r\nout of the city by night, and went a great journey, and came and brought\r\nhim to the city called Petra, where the palace of Aretas was; and as he\r\nwas a very familiar friend of that king, he persuaded him to bring back\r\nHyrcanus into Judea, and this persuasion he continued every day without\r\nany intermission. He also proposed to make him presents on that account.\r\nAt length he prevailed with Aretas in his suit. Moreover, Hyrcanus\r\npromised him, that when he had been brought thither, and had received\r\nhis kingdom, he would restore that country, and those twelve cities\r\nwhich his father Alexander had taken from the Arabians, which were\r\nthese, Medaba, Naballo, Libias, Tharabasa, Agala, Athone, Zoar, Orone,\r\nMarissa, Rudda, Lussa, and Oruba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How Aretas And Hyrcanus Made An Expedition Against\r\nAristobulus And Besieged Jerusalem; And How Scaurus The Roman General\r\nRaised The Siege. Concerning The Death Of Onias.\r\n\r\n1. After these promises had been given to Aretas, he made an expedition\r\nagainst Aristobulus with an army of fifty thousand horse and foot, and\r\nbeat him in the battle. And when after that victory many went over to\r\nHyrcanus as deserters, Aristobulus was left desolate, and fled to\r\nJerusalem; upon which the king of Arabia took all his army, and made an\r\nassault upon the temple, and besieged Aristobulus therein, the people\r\nstill supporting Hyrcanus, and assisting him in the siege, while none\r\nbut the priests continued with Aristobulus. So Aretas united the forces\r\nof the Arabians and of the Jews together, and pressed on the siege\r\nvigorously. As this happened at the time when the feast of unleavened\r\nbread was celebrated, which we call the passover, the principal men\r\namong the Jews left the country, and fled into Egypt. Now there was one,\r\nwhose name was Onias, a righteous man he was, and beloved of God, who,\r\nin a certain drought, had prayed to God to put an end to the intense\r\nheat, and whose prayers God had heard, and had sent them rain. This man\r\nhad hid himself, because he saw that this sedition would last a great\r\nwhile. However, they brought him to the Jewish camp, and desired, that\r\nas by his prayers he had once put an end to the drought, so he would in\r\nlike manner make imprecations on Aristobulus and those of his faction.\r\nAnd when, upon his refusal, and the excuses that he made, he was still\r\nby the multitude compelled to speak, he stood up in the midst of them,\r\nand said, \"O God, the King of the whole world! since those that stand\r\nnow with me are thy people, and those that are besieged are also thy\r\npriests, I beseech thee, that thou wilt neither hearken to the prayers\r\nof those against these, nor bring to effect what these pray against\r\nthose.\" Whereupon such wicked Jews as stood about him, as soon as he had\r\nmade this prayer, stoned him to death.\r\n\r\n2. But God punished them immediately for this their barbarity, and took\r\nvengeance of them for the murder of Onias, in the manner following:\r\nWhile the priests and Aristobulus were besieged, it happened that the\r\nfeast called the passover was come, at which it is our custom to offer a\r\ngreat number of sacrifices to God; but those that were with Aristobulus\r\nwanted sacrifices, and desired that their countrymen without would\r\nfurnish them with such sacrifices, and assured them they should have as\r\nmuch money for them as they should desire; and when they required them\r\nto pay a thousand drachmae for each head of cattle, Aristobulus and the\r\npriests willingly undertook to pay for them accordingly, and those\r\nwithin let down the money over the walls, and gave it them. But when the\r\nothers had received it, they did not deliver the sacrifices, but arrived\r\nat that height of wickedness as to break the assurances they had given,\r\nand to be guilty of impiety towards God, by not furnishing those that\r\nwanted them with sacrifices. And when the priests found they had been\r\ncheated, and that the agreements they had made were violated, they\r\nprayed to God that he would avenge them on their countrymen. Nor did he\r\ndelay that their punishment, but sent a strong and vehement storm of\r\nwind, that destroyed the fruits of the whole country, till a modius of\r\nwheat was then bought for eleven drachmae.\r\n\r\n3. In the mean time Pompey sent Scaurus into Syria, while he was himself\r\nin Armenia, and making war with Tigranes; but when Scaurus was come to\r\nDamascus, and found that Lollins and Metellus had newly taken the city,\r\nhe came himself hastily into Judea. And when he was come thither,\r\nambassadors came to him, both from Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, and both\r\ndesired he would assist them. And when both of them promised to give him\r\nmoney, Aristobulus four hundred talents, and Hyrcanus no less, he\r\naccepted of Aristobulus's promise, for he was rich, and had a great\r\nsoul, and desired to obtain nothing but what was moderate; whereas the\r\nother was poor, and tenacious, and made incredible promises in hopes of\r\ngreater advantages; for it was not the same thing to take a city that\r\nwas exceeding strong and powerful, as it was to eject out of the country\r\nsome fugitives, with a greater number of Mabateans, who were no very\r\nwarlike people. He therefore made an agreement with Aristobulus, for the\r\nreasons before mentioned, and took his money, and raised the siege, and\r\nordered Aretas to depart, or else he should be declared an enemy to the\r\nRomans. So Scaurus returned to Damascus again; and Aristobulus, with a\r\ngreat army, made war with Aretas and Hyrcanus, and fought them at a\r\nplace called Papyron, and beat them in the battle, and slew about six\r\nthousand of the enemy, with whom fell Phalion also, the brother of\r\nAntipater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How Aristobulus And Hyrcanus Came To Pompey In Order To Argue\r\nWho Ought To Have The Kingdom; And How Upon The Plight Of Aristobulus To\r\nThe Fortress Alexandrium Pompey Led His Army Against Him And Ordered Him\r\nTo Deliver Up The Fortresses Whereof He Was Possessed.\r\n\r\n1. A Little afterward Pompey came to Damascus, and marched over\r\nCelesyria; at which time there came ambassadors to him from all Syria,\r\nand Egypt, and out of Judea also, for Aristobulus had sent him a great\r\npresent, which was a golden vine 3 of the value of five hundred talents.\r\nNow Strabo of Cappadocia mentions this present in these words: \"There\r\ncame also an embassage out of Egypt, and a crown of the value of four\r\nthousand pieces of gold; and out of Judea there came another, whether\r\nyou call it a vine or a garden; they call the thing Terpole, the\r\nDelight. However, we ourselves saw that present reposited at Rome, in\r\nthe temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, with this inscription, 'The gift of\r\nAlexander, the king of the Jews.' It was valued at five hundred talents;\r\nand the report is, that Aristobulus, the governor of the Jews, sent it.\"\r\n\r\n2. In a little time afterward came ambassadors again to him, Antipater\r\nfrom Hyrcanus, and Nicodemus from Aristobulus; which last also accused\r\nsuch as had taken bribes; first Gabinius, and then Scaurus,—the one\r\nthree hundred talents, and the other four hundred; by which procedure he\r\nmade these two his enemies, besides those he had before. And when Pompey\r\nhad ordered those that had controversies one with another to come to him\r\nin the beginning of the spring, he brought his army out of their winter\r\nquarters, and marched into the country of Damascus; and as he went along\r\nhe demolished the citadel that was at Apamia, which Antiochus Cyzicenus\r\nhad built, and took cognizance of the country of Ptolemy Menneus, a\r\nwicked man, and not less so than Dionysius of Tripoli, who had been\r\nbeheaded, who was also his relation by marriage; yet did he buy off the\r\npunishment of his crimes for a thousand talents, with which money Pompey\r\npaid the soldiers their wages. He also conquered the place called\r\nLysias, of which Silas a Jew was tyrant. And when he had passed over the\r\ncities of Heliopolis and Chalcis, and got over the mountain which is on\r\nthe limit of Celesyria, he came from Pella to Damascus; and there it was\r\nthat he heard the causes of the Jews, and of their governors Hyrcanus\r\nand Aristobulus, who were at difference one with another, as also of the\r\nnation against them both, which did not desire to be under kingly'\r\ngovernment, because the form of government they received from their\r\nforefathers was that of subjection to the priests of that God whom they\r\nworshipped; and [they complained], that though these two were the\r\nposterity of priests, yet did they seek to change the government of\r\ntheir nation to another form, in order to enslave them. Hyrcanus\r\ncomplained, that although he were the elder brother, he was deprived of\r\nthe prerogative of his birth by Aristobulus, and that he had but a small\r\npart of the country under him, Aristobulus having taken away the rest\r\nfrom him by force. He also accused him, that the incursions which had\r\nbeen made into their neighbors' countries, and the piracies that had\r\nbeen at sea, were owing to him; and that the nation would not have\r\nrevolted, unless Aristobulus had been a man given to violence and\r\ndisorder; and there were no fewer than a thousand Jews, of the best\r\nesteem among them, who confirmed this accusation; which confirmation was\r\nprocured by Antipater. But Aristobulus alleged against him, that it was\r\nHyrcanus's own temper, which was inactive, and on that account\r\ncontemptible, which caused him to be deprived of the government; and\r\nthat for himself, he was necessitated to take it upon him, for fear lest\r\nit should be transferred to others. And that as to his title [of king],\r\nit was no other than what his father had taken [before him]. He also\r\ncalled for witnesses of what he said some persons who were both young\r\nand insolent; whose purple garments, fine heads of hair, and other\r\nornaments, were detested [by the court], and which they appeared in, not\r\nas though they were to plead their cause in a court of justice, but as\r\nif they were marching in a pompous procession.\r\n\r\n3. When Pompey had heard the causes of these two, and had condemned\r\nAristobulus for his violent procedure, he then spake civilly to them,\r\nand sent them away; and told them, that when he came again into their\r\ncountry, he would settle all their affairs, after he had first taken a\r\nview of the affairs of the Nabateans. In the mean time, he ordered them\r\nto be quiet; and treated Aristobulus civilly, lest he should make the\r\nnation revolt, and hinder his return; which yet Aristobulus did; for\r\nwithout expecting any further determination, which Pompey had promised\r\nthem, he went to the city Delius, and thence marched into Judea.\r\n\r\n4. At this behavior Pompey was angry; and taking with him that army\r\nwhich he was leading against the Nabateans, and the auxiliaries that\r\ncame from Damascus, and the other parts of Syria, with the other Roman\r\nlegions which he had with him, he made an expedition against\r\nAristobulus; but as he passed by Pella and Scythopolis, he came to\r\nCorem, which is the first entrance into Judea when one passes over the\r\nmidland countries, where he came to a most beautiful fortress that was\r\nbuilt on the top of a mountain called Alexandrium, whither Aristobulus\r\nhad fled; and thence Pompey sent his commands to him, that he should\r\ncome to him. Accordingly, at the persuasions of many that he would not\r\nmake war with the Romans, he came down; and when he had disputed with\r\nhis brother about the right to the government, he went up again to the\r\ncitadel, as Pompey gave him leave to do; and this he did two or three\r\ntimes, as flattering himself with the hopes of having the kingdom\r\ngranted him; so that he still pretended he would obey Pompey in\r\nwhatsoever he commanded, although at the same time he retired to his\r\nfortress, that he might not depress himself too low, and that he might\r\nbe prepared for a war, in case it should prove as he feared, that Pompey\r\nwould transfer the government to Hyrcanus. But when Pompey enjoined\r\nAristobulus to deliver up the fortresses he held, and to send an\r\ninjunction to their governors under his own hand for that purpose, for\r\nthey had been forbidden to deliver them up upon any other commands, he\r\nsubmitted indeed to do so; but still he retired in displeasure to\r\nJerusalem, and made preparation for war. A little after this, certain\r\npersons came out of Pontus, and informed Pompey, as he was on the way,\r\nand conducting his army against Aristobulus, that Mithridates was dead,\r\nand was slain by his son Pharmaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How Pompey When The Citizens Of Jerusalem Shut Their Gates\r\nAgainst Him Besieged The City And Took It By Force; As Also What Other\r\nThings He Did In Judea.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Pompey had pitched his camp at Jericho, [where the palm tree\r\ngrows, and that balsam which is an ointment of all the most precious,\r\nwhich upon any incision made in the wood with a sharp stone, distills\r\nout thence like a juice,] 4 he marched in the morning to Jerusalem.\r\nHereupon Aristobulus repented of what he was doing, and came to Pompey,\r\nhad [promised to] give him money, and received him into Jerusalem, and\r\ndesired that he would leave off the war, and do what he pleased\r\npeaceably. So Pompey, upon his entreaty, forgave him, and sent Gabinius,\r\nand soldiers with him, to receive the money and the city: yet was no\r\npart of this performed; but Gabinius came back, being both excluded out\r\nof the city, and receiving none of the money promised, because\r\nAristobulus's soldiers would not permit the agreements to be executed.\r\nAt this Pompey was very angry, and put Aristobulus into prison, and came\r\nhimself to the city, which was strong on every side, excepting the\r\nnorth, which was not so well fortified, for there was a broad and deep\r\nditch that encompassed the city 5 and included within it the temple,\r\nwhich was itself encompassed about with a very strong stone wall.\r\n\r\n2. Now there was a sedition of the men that were within the city, who\r\ndid not agree what was to be done in their present circumstances, while\r\nsome thought it best to deliver up the city to Pompey; but Aristobulus's\r\nparty exhorted them to shut the gates, because he was kept in prison.\r\nNow these prevented the others, and seized upon the temple, and cut off\r\nthe bridge which reached from it to the city, and prepared themselves to\r\nabide a siege; but the others admitted Pompey's army in, and delivered\r\nup both the city and the king's palace to him. So Pompey sent his\r\nlieutenant Piso with an army, and placed garrisons both in the city and\r\nin the palace, to secure them, and fortified the houses that joined to\r\nthe temple, and all those which were more distant and without it. And in\r\nthe first place, he offered terms of accommodation to those within; but\r\nwhen they would not comply with what was desired, he encompassed all the\r\nplaces thereabout with a wall, wherein Hyrcanus did gladly assist him on\r\nall occasions; but Pompey pitched his camp within [the wall], on the\r\nnorth part of the temple, where it was most practicable; but even on\r\nthat side there were great towers, and a ditch had been dug, and a deep\r\nvalley begirt it round about, for on the parts towards the city were\r\nprecipices, and the bridge on which Pompey had gotten in was broken\r\ndown. However, a bank was raised, day by day, with a great deal of\r\nlabor, while the Romans cut down materials for it from the places round\r\nabout. And when this bank was sufficiently raised, and the ditch filled\r\nup, though but poorly, by reason of its immense depth, he brought his\r\nmechanical engines and battering-rams from Tyre, and placing them on the\r\nbank, he battered the temple with the stones that were thrown against\r\nit. And had it not been our practice, from the days of our forefathers,\r\nto rest on the seventh day, this bank could never have been perfected,\r\nby reason of the opposition the Jews would have made; for though our law\r\ngives us leave then to defend ourselves against those that begin to\r\nfight with us and assault us, yet does it not permit us to meddle with\r\nour enemies while they do any thing else.\r\n\r\n3. Which thing when the Romans understood, on those days which we call\r\nSabbaths they threw nothing at the Jews, nor came to any pitched battle\r\nwith them; but raised up their earthen banks, and brought their engines\r\ninto such forwardness, that they might do execution the next day. And\r\nany one may hence learn how very great piety we exercise towards God,\r\nand the observance of his laws, since the priests were not at all\r\nhindered from their sacred ministrations by their fear during this\r\nsiege, but did still twice a-day, in the morning and about the ninth\r\nhour, offer their sacrifices on the altar; nor did they omit those\r\nsacrifices, if any melancholy accident happened by the stones that were\r\nthrown among them; for although the city was taken on the third month,\r\non the day of the fast, 6 upon the hundred and seventy-ninth olympiad,\r\nwhen Caius Antonius and Marcus Tullius Cicero were consuls, and the\r\nenemy then fell upon them, and cut the throats of those that were in the\r\ntemple; yet could not those that offered the sacrifices be compelled to\r\nrun away, neither by the fear they were in of their own lives, nor by\r\nthe number that were already slain, as thinking it better to suffer\r\nwhatever came upon them, at their very altars, than to omit any thing\r\nthat their laws required of them. And that this is not a mere brag, or\r\nan encomium to manifest a degree of our piety that was false, but is the\r\nreal truth, I appeal to those that have written of the acts of Pompey;\r\nand, among them, to Strabo and Nicolaus [of Damascus]; and besides these\r\ntwo, Titus Livius, the writer of the Roman History, who will bear\r\nwitness to this thing. 7\r\n\r\n4. But when the battering-engine was brought near, the greatest of the\r\ntowers was shaken by it, and fell down, and broke down a part of the\r\nfortifications, so the enemy poured in apace; and Cornelius Faustus, the\r\nson of Sylla, with his soldiers, first of all ascended the wall, and\r\nnext to him Furius the centurion, with those that followed on the other\r\npart, while Fabius, who was also a centurion, ascended it in the middle,\r\nwith a great body of men after him. But now all was full of slaughter;\r\nsome of the Jews being slain by the Romans, and some by one another;\r\nnay, some there were who threw themselves down the precipices, or put\r\nfire to their houses, and burnt them, as not able to bear the miseries\r\nthey were under. Of the Jews there fell twelve thousand, but of the\r\nRomans very few. Absalom, who was at once both uncle and father-in-law\r\nto Aristobulus, was taken captive; and no small enormities were\r\ncommitted about the temple itself, which, in former ages, had been\r\ninaccessible, and seen by none; for Pompey went into it, and not a few\r\nof those that were with him also, and saw all that which it was unlawful\r\nfor any other men to see but only for the high priests. There were in\r\nthat temple the golden table, the holy candlestick, and the pouring\r\nvessels, and a great quantity of spices; and besides these there were\r\namong the treasures two thousand talents of sacred money: yet did Pompey\r\ntouch nothing of all this, 8 on account of his regard to religion; and\r\nin this point also he acted in a manner that was worthy of his virtue.\r\nThe next day he gave order to those that had the charge of the temple to\r\ncleanse it, and to bring what offerings the law required to God; and\r\nrestored the high priesthood to Hyrcanus, both because he had been\r\nuseful to him in other respects, and because he hindered the Jews in the\r\ncountry from giving Aristobulus any assistance in his war against him.\r\nHe also cut off those that had been the authors of that war; and\r\nbestowed proper rewards on Faustus, and those others that mounted the\r\nwall with such alacrity; and he made Jerusalem tributary to the Romans,\r\nand took away those cities of Celesyria which the inhabitants of Judea\r\nhad subdued, and put them under the government of the Roman president,\r\nand confined the whole nation, which had elevated itself so high before,\r\nwithin its own bounds. Moreover, he rebuilt Gadara, 9 which had been\r\ndemolished a little before, to gratify Demetrius of Gadara, who was his\r\nfreedman, and restored the rest of the cities, Hippos, and Scythopolis,\r\nand Pella, and Dios, and Samaria, as also Marissa, and Ashdod, and\r\nJamnia, and Arethusa, to their own inhabitants: these were in the inland\r\nparts. Besides those that had been demolished, and also of the maritime\r\ncities, Gaza, and Joppa, and Dora, and Strato's Tower; which last Herod\r\nrebuilt after a glorious manner, and adorned with havens and temples,\r\nand changed its name to Cæsarea. All these Pompey left in a state of\r\nfreedom, and joined them to the province of Syria.\r\n\r\n5. Now the occasions of this misery which came upon Jerusalem were\r\nHyrcanus and Aristobulus, by raising a sedition one against the other;\r\nfor now we lost our liberty, and became subject to the Romans, and were\r\ndeprived of that country which we had gained by our arms from the\r\nSyrians, and were compelled to restore it to the Syrians. Moreover, the\r\nRomans exacted of us, in a little time, above ten thousand talents; and\r\nthe royal authority, which was a dignity formerly bestowed on those that\r\nwere high priests, by the right of their family, became the property of\r\nprivate men. But of these matters we shall treat in their proper places.\r\nNow Pompey committed Celesyria, as far as the river Euphrates and Egypt,\r\nto Scaurus, with two Roman legions, and then went away to Cilicia, and\r\nmade haste to Rome. He also carried bound along with him Aristobulus and\r\nhis children; for he had two daughters, and as many sons; the one of\r\nwhich ran away, but the younger, Antigonus, was carried to Rome,\r\ntogether with his sisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How Scaurus Made A League Of Mutual Assistance With Aretas;\r\nAnd What Gabinius Did In Judea, After He Had Conquered Alexander, The\r\nSon Of Aristobulus.\r\n\r\n1. Scaurus made now an expedition against Petrea, in Arabia, and set on\r\nfire all the places round about it, because of the great difficulty of\r\naccess to it. And as his army was pinched by famine, Antipater furnished\r\nhim with corn out of Judea, and with whatever else he wanted, and this\r\nat the command of Hyrcanus. And when he was sent to Aretas, as an\r\nambassador by Scaurus, because he had lived with him formerly, he\r\npersuaded Aretas to give Scaurus a sum of money, to prevent the burning\r\nof his country, and undertook to be his surety for three hundred\r\ntalents. So Scaurus, upon these terms, ceased to make war any longer;\r\nwhich was done as much at Scaurus's desire, as at the desire of Aretas.\r\n\r\n2. Some time after this, when Alexander, the son of Aristobulus, made an\r\nincursion into Judea, Gabinius came from Rome into Syria, as commander\r\nof the Roman forces. He did many considerable actions; and particularly\r\nmade war with Alexander, since Hyrcanus was not yet able to oppose his\r\npower, but was already attempting to rebuild the wall of Jerusalem,\r\nwhich Pompey had overthrown, although the Romans which were there\r\nrestrained him from that his design. However, Alexander went over all\r\nthe country round about, and armed many of the Jews, and suddenly got\r\ntogether ten thousand armed footmen, and fifteen hundred horsemen, and\r\nfortified Alexandrium, a fortress near to Corem, and Macherus, near the\r\nmountains of Arabia. Gabinius therefore came upon him, having sent\r\nMarcus Antonius, with other commanders, before. These armed such Romans\r\nas followed them; and, together with them, such Jews as were subject to\r\nthem, whose leaders were Pitholaus and Malichus; and they took with them\r\nalso their friends that were with Antipater, and met Alexander, while\r\nGabinius himself followed with his legion. Hereupon Alexander retired to\r\nthe neighborhood of Jerusalem, where they fell upon one another, and it\r\ncame to a pitched battle, in which the Romans slew of their enemies\r\nabout three thousand, and took a like number alive.\r\n\r\n3. At which time Gabinius 10 came to Alexandrium, and invited those that\r\nwere in it to deliver it up on certain conditions, and promised that\r\nthen their former offenses should be forgiven. But as a great number of\r\nthe enemy had pitched their camp before the fortress, whom the Romans\r\nattacked, Marcus Antonius fought bravely, and slew a great number, and\r\nseemed to come off with the greatest honor. So Gabinius left part of his\r\narmy there, in order to take the place, and he himself went into other\r\nparts of Judea, and gave order to rebuild all the cities that he met\r\nwith that had been demolished; at which time were rebuilt Samaria,\r\nAshdod, Scythopolis, Anthedon, Raphia, and Dora; Marissa also, and Gaza,\r\nand not a few others besides. And as the men acted according to\r\nGabinius's command, it came to pass, that at this time these cities were\r\nsecurely inhabited, which had been desolate for a long time.\r\n\r\n4. When Gabinius had done thus in the country, he returned to\r\nAlexandrium; and when he urged on the siege of the place, Alexander sent\r\nan embassage to him, desiring that he would pardon his former offenses;\r\nhe also delivered up the fortresses, Hyrcania and Macherus, and at last\r\nAlexandrium itself which fortresses Gabinius demolished. But when\r\nAlexander's mother, who was of the side of the Romans, as having her\r\nhusband and other children at Rome, came to him, he granted her\r\nwhatsoever she asked; and when he had settled matters with her, he\r\nbrought Hyrcanus to Jerusalem, and committed the care of the temple to\r\nhim. And when he had ordained five councils, he distributed the nation\r\ninto the same number of parts. So these councils governed the people;\r\nthe first was at Jerusalem, the second at Gadara, the third at Amathus,\r\nthe fourth at Jericho, and the fifth at Sepphoris in Galilee. So the\r\nJews were now freed from monarchic authority, and were governed by an\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How Gabinius Caught Aristobulus After He Had Fled From Rome,\r\nAnd Sent Him Back To Rome Again; And How The Same Gabinius As He\r\nReturned Out Of Egypt Overcame Alexander And The Nabateans In Battle.\r\n\r\n1. Now Aristobulus ran away from Rome to Judea, and set about the\r\nrebuilding of Alexandrium, which had been newly demolished. Hereupon\r\nGabinius sent soldiers against him, add for their commanders Sisenna,\r\nand Antonius, and Servilius, in order to hinder him from getting\r\npossession of the country, and to take him again. And indeed many of the\r\nJews ran to Aristobulus, on account of his former glory, as also because\r\nthey should be glad of an innovation. Now there was one Pitholaus, a\r\nlieutenant at Jerusalem, who deserted to him with a thousand men,\r\nalthough a great number of those that came to him were unarmed; and when\r\nAristobulus had resolved to go to Macherus, he dismissed those people,\r\nbecause they were unarmed; for they could not be useful to him in what\r\nactions he was going about; but he took with him eight thousand that\r\nwere armed, and marched on; and as the Romans fell upon them severely,\r\nthe Jews fought valiantly, but were beaten in the battle; and when they\r\nhad fought with alacrity, but were overborne by the enemy, they were put\r\nto flight; of whom were slain about five thousand, and the rest being\r\ndispersed, tried, as well as they were able, to save themselves.\r\nHowever, Aristobulus had with him still above a thousand, and with them\r\nhe fled to Macherus, and fortified the place; and though he had had ill\r\nsuccess, he still had good hope of his affairs; but when he had\r\nstruggled against the siege for two days' time, and had received many\r\nwounds, he was brought as a captive to Gabinius, with his son Antigonus,\r\nwho also fled with him from Rome. And this was the fortune of\r\nAristobulus, who was sent back again to Rome, and was there retained in\r\nbonds, having been both king and high priest for three years and six\r\nmonths; and was indeed an eminent person, and one of a great soul.\r\nHowever, the senate let his children go, upon Gabinius's writing to them\r\nthat he had promised their mother so much when she delivered up the\r\nfortresses to him; and accordingly they then returned into Judea.\r\n\r\n2. Now when Gabinius was making an expedition against the Parthians, and\r\nhad already passed over Euphrates, he changed his mind, and resolved to\r\nreturn into Egypt, in order to restore Ptolemy to his kingdom. 11 This\r\nhath also been related elsewhere. However, Antipater supplied his army,\r\nwhich he sent against Archelaus, with corn, and weapons, and money. He\r\nalso made those Jews who were above Pelusium his friends and\r\nconfederates, and had been the guardians of the passes that led into\r\nEgypt. But when he came back out of Egypt, he found Syria in disorder,\r\nwith seditions and troubles; for Alexander, the son of Aristobulus,\r\nhaving seized on the government a second time by force, made many of the\r\nJews revolt to him; and so he marched over the country with a great\r\narmy, and slew all the Romans he could light upon, and proceeded to\r\nbesiege the mountain called Gerizzim, whither they had retreated.\r\n\r\n3. But when Gabinius found Syria in such a state, he sent Antipater, who\r\nwas a prudent man, to those that were seditious, to try whether he could\r\ncure them of their madness, and persuade them to return to a better\r\nmind; and when he came to them, he brought many of them to a sound mind,\r\nand induced them to do what they ought to do; but he could not restrain\r\nAlexander, for he had an army of thirty thousand Jews, and met Gabinius,\r\nand joining battle with him, was beaten, and lost ten thousand of his\r\nmen about Mount Tabor.\r\n\r\n4. So Gabinius settled the affairs which belonged to the city Jerusalem,\r\nas was agreeable to Antipater's inclination, and went against the\r\nNabateans, and overcame them in battle. He also sent away in a friendly\r\nmanner Mithridates and Orsanes, who were Parthian deserters, and came to\r\nhim, though the report went abroad that they had run away from him. And\r\nwhen Gabinius had performed great and glorious actions, in his\r\nmanagement of the affairs of war, he returned to Rome, and delivered the\r\ngovernment to Crassus. Now Nicolaus of Damascus, and Strabo of\r\nCappadocia, both describe the expeditions of Pompey and Gabinius against\r\nthe Jews, while neither of them say anything new which is not in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How Crassus Came Into Judea, And Pillaged The Temple; And\r\nThen Marched Against The Parthians And Perished, With His Army. Also How\r\nCassius Obtained Syria, And Put A Stop To The Parthians And Then Went Up\r\nTo Judea.\r\n\r\n1. Now Crassus, as he was going upon his expedition against the\r\nParthians, came into Judea, and carried off the money that was in the\r\ntemple, which Pompey had left, being two thousand talents, and was\r\ndisposed to spoil it of all the gold belonging to it, which was eight\r\nthousand talents. He also took a beam, which was made of solid beaten\r\ngold, of the weight of three hundred minae, each of which weighed two\r\npounds and a half. It was the priest who was guardian of the sacred\r\ntreasures, and whose name was Eleazar, that gave him this beam, not out\r\nof a wicked design, for he was a good and a righteous man; but being\r\nintrusted with the custody of the veils belonging to the temple, which\r\nwere of admirable beauty, and of very costly workmanship, and hung down\r\nfrom this beam, when he saw that Crassus was busy in gathering money,\r\nand was in fear for the entire ornaments of the temple, he gave him this\r\nbeam of gold as a ransom for the whole, but this not till he had given\r\nhis oath that he would remove nothing else out of the temple, but be\r\nsatisfied with this only, which he should give him, being worth many ten\r\nthousand [shekels]. Now this beam was contained in a wooden beam that\r\nwas hollow, but was known to no others; but Eleazar alone knew it; yet\r\ndid Crassus take away this beam, upon the condition of touching nothing\r\nelse that belonged to the temple, and then brake his oath, and carried\r\naway all the gold that was in the temple.\r\n\r\n2. And let no one wonder that there was so much wealth in our temple,\r\nsince all the Jews throughout the habitable earth, and those that\r\nworshipped God, nay, even those of Asia and Europe, sent their\r\ncontributions to it, and this from very ancient times. Nor is the\r\nlargeness of these sums without its attestation; nor is that greatness\r\nowing to our vanity, as raising it without ground to so great a height;\r\nbut there are many witnesses to it, and particularly Strabo of\r\nCappadocia, who says thus: \"Mithridates sent to Cos, and took the money\r\nwhich queen Cleopatra had deposited there, as also eight hundred talents\r\nbelonging to the Jews.\" Now we have no public money but only what\r\nappertains to God; and it is evident that the Asian Jews removed this\r\nmoney out of fear of Mithridates; for it is not probable that those of\r\nJudea, who had a strong city and temple, should send their money to Cos;\r\nnor is it likely that the Jews who are inhabitants of Alexandria should\r\ndo so neither, since they were in no fear of Mithridates. And Strabo\r\nhimself bears witness to the same thing in another place, that at the\r\nsame time that Sylla passed over into Greece, in order to fight against\r\nMithridates, he sent Lucullus to put an end to a sedition that our\r\nnation, of whom the habitable earth is full, had raised in Cyrene; where\r\nhe speaks thus: \"There were four classes of men among those of Cyrene;\r\nthat of citizens, that of husbandmen, the third of strangers, and the\r\nfourth of Jews. Now these Jews are already gotten into all cities; and\r\nit is hard to find a place in the habitable earth that hath not admitted\r\nthis tribe of men, and is not possessed by them; and it hath come to\r\npass that Egypt and Cyrene, as having the same governors, and a great\r\nnumber of other nations, imitate their way of living, and maintain great\r\nbodies of these Jews in a peculiar manner, and grow up to greater\r\nprosperity with them, and make use of the same laws with that nation\r\nalso. Accordingly, the Jews have places assigned them in Egypt, wherein\r\nthey inhabit, besides what is peculiarly allotted to this nation at\r\nAlexandria, which is a large part of that city. There is also an\r\nethnarch allowed them, who governs the nation, and distributes justice\r\nto them, and takes care of their contracts, and of the laws to them\r\nbelonging, as if he were the ruler of a free republic. In Egypt,\r\ntherefore, this nation is powerful, because the Jews were originally\r\nEgyptians, and because the land wherein they inhabit, since they went\r\nthence, is near to Egypt. They also removed into Cyrene, because that\r\nthis land adjoined to the government of Egypt, as well as does Judea, or\r\nrather was formerly under the same government.\" And this is what Strabo\r\nsays.\r\n\r\n3. So when Crassus had settled all things as he himself pleased, he\r\nmarched into Parthia, where both he himself and all his army perished,\r\nas hath been related elsewhere. But Cassius, as he fled from Rome to\r\nSyria, took possession of it, and was an impediment to the Parthians,\r\nwho by reason of their victory over Crassus made incursions upon it. And\r\nas he came back to Tyre, he went up into Judea also, and fell upon\r\nTarichee, and presently took it, and carried about thirty thousand Jews\r\ncaptives; and slew Pitholaus, who succeeded Aristobulus in his seditious\r\npractices, and that by the persuasion of Antipater, who proved to have\r\ngreat interest in him, and was at that time in great repute with the\r\nIdumeans also: out of which nation he married a wife, who was the\r\ndaughter of one of their eminent men, and her name was Cypros, 12 by\r\nwhom he had four sons, Phasael, and Herod, who was afterwards made king,\r\nand Joseph, and Pheroras; and a daughter, named Salome. This Antipater\r\ncultivated also a friendship and mutual kindness with other potentates,\r\nbut especially with the king of Arabia, to whom he committed his\r\nchildren, while he fought against Aristobulus. So Cassius removed his\r\ncamp, and marched to Euphrates, to meet those that were coming to attack\r\nhim, as hath been related by others.\r\n\r\n4. But some time afterward Cæsar, when he had taken Rome, and after\r\nPompey and the senate were fled beyond the Ionian Sea, freed Aristobulus\r\nfrom his bonds, and resolved to send him into Syria, and delivered two\r\nlegions to him, that he might set matters right, as being a potent man\r\nin that country. But Aristobulus had no enjoyment of what he hoped for\r\nfrom the power that was given him by Cæsar; for those of Pompey's party\r\nprevented it, and destroyed him by poison; and those of Cæsar's party\r\nburied him. His dead body also lay, for a good while, embalmed in honey,\r\ntill Antony afterward sent it to Judea, and caused him to be buried in\r\nthe royal sepulcher. But Scipio, upon Pompey's sending to him to slay\r\nAlexander, the son of Aristobulus, because the young man was accused of\r\nwhat offenses he had been guilty of at first against the Romans, cut off\r\nhis head; and thus did he die at Antioch. But Ptolemy, the son of\r\nMenneus, who was the ruler of Chalcis, under Mount Libanus, took his\r\nbrethren to him, and sent his son Philippion to Askelon to Aristobulus's\r\nwife, and desired her to send back with him her son Antigonus, and her\r\ndaughters; the one of which, whose name was Alexandra, Philippion fell\r\nin love with, and married her, though afterward his father Ptolemy slew\r\nhim, and married Alexandra, and continued to take care of her brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. The Jews Become Confederates With Cæsar When He Fought\r\nAgainst Egypt. The Glorious Actions Of Antipater, And His Friendship\r\nWith Cæsar. The Honors Which The Jews Received From The Romans And\r\nAthenians.\r\n\r\n1. Now after Pompey was dead, and after that victory Cæsar had gained\r\nover him, Antipater, who managed the Jewish affairs, became very useful\r\nto Cæsar when he made war against Egypt, and that by the order of\r\nHyrcanus; for when Mithridates of Pergainus was bringing his\r\nauxiliaries, and was not able to continue his march through Pelusium,\r\nbut obliged to stay at Askelon, Antipater came to him, conducting three\r\nthousand of the Jews, armed men. He had also taken care the principal\r\nmen of the Arabians should come to his assistance; and on his account it\r\nwas that all the Syrians assisted him also, as not willing to appear\r\nbehindhand in their alacrity for Cæsar, viz. Jamblicus the ruler, and\r\nPtolemy his son, and Tholomy the son of Sohemus, who dwelt at Mount\r\nLibanus, and almost all the cities. So Mithridates marched out of Syria,\r\nand came to Pelusium; and when its inhabitants would not admit him, he\r\nbesieged the city. Now Antipater signalized himself here, and was the\r\nfirst who plucked down a part of the wall, and so opened a way to the\r\nrest, whereby they might enter the city, and by this means Pelusium was\r\ntaken. But it happened that the Egyptian Jews, who dwelt in the country\r\ncalled Onion, would not let Antipater and Mithridates, with their\r\nsoldiers, pass to Cæsar; but Antipater persuaded them to come over with\r\ntheir party, because he was of the same people with them, and that\r\nchiefly by showing them the epistles of Hyrcanus the high priest,\r\nwherein he exhorted them to cultivate friendship with Cæsar, and to\r\nsupply his army with money, and all sorts of provisions which they\r\nwanted; and accordingly, when they saw Antipater and the high priest of\r\nthe same sentiments, they did as they were desired. And when the Jews\r\nabout Memphis heard that these Jews were come over to Cæsar, they also\r\ninvited Mithridates to come to them; so he came and received them also\r\ninto his army.\r\n\r\n2. And when Mithridates had gone over all Delta, as the place is called,\r\nhe came to a pitched battle with the enemy, near the place called the\r\nJewish Camp. Now Mithridates had the right wing, and Antipater the left;\r\nand when it came to a fight, that wing where Mithridates was gave way,\r\nand was likely to suffer extremely, unless Antipater had come running to\r\nhim with his own soldiers along the shore, when he had already beaten\r\nthe enemy that opposed him; so he delivered Mithridates, and put those\r\nEgyptians who had been too hard for him to flight. He also took their\r\ncamp, and continued in the pursuit of them. He also recalled\r\nMithridates, who had been worsted, and was retired a great way off; of\r\nwhose soldiers eight hundred fell, but of Antipater's fifty. So\r\nMithridates sent an account of this battle to Cæsar, and openly declared\r\nthat Antipater was the author of this victory, and of his own\r\npreservation, insomuch that Cæsar commended Antipater then, and made use\r\nof him all the rest of that war in the most hazardous undertakings; he\r\nhappened also to be wounded in one of those engagements.\r\n\r\n3. However, when Cæsar, after some time, had finished that war, and was\r\nsailed away for Syria, he honored Antipater greatly, and confirmed\r\nHyrcanus in the high priesthood; and bestowed on Antipater the privilege\r\nof a citizen of Rome, and a freedom from taxes every where; and it is\r\nreported by many, that Hyrcanus went along with Antipater in this\r\nexpedition, and came himself into Egypt. And Strabo of Cappadocia bears\r\nwitness to this, when he says thus, in the name of Aslnius: \"After\r\nMithridates had invaded Egypt, and with him Hyrcanus the high priest of\r\nthe Jews.\" Nay, the same Strabo says thus again, in another place, in\r\nthe name of Hypsicrates, that \"Mithridates at first went out alone; but\r\nthat Antipater, who had the care of the Jewish affairs, was called by\r\nhim to Askelon, and that he had gotten ready three thousand soldiers to\r\ngo along with him, and encouraged other governors of the country to go\r\nalong with him also; and that Hyrcanus the high priest was also present\r\nin this expedition.\" This is what Strabo says.\r\n\r\n4. But Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus, came at this time to Cæsar,\r\nand lamented his father's fate; and complained, that it was by\r\nAntipater's means that Aristobulus was taken off by poison, and his\r\nbrother was beheaded by Scipio, and desired that he would take pity of\r\nhim who had been ejected out of that principality which was due to him.\r\nHe also accused Hyrcanus and Antipater as governing the nation by\r\nviolence, and offering injuries to himself. Antipater was present, and\r\nmade his defense as to the accusations that were laid against him. He\r\ndemonstrated that Antigonus and his party were given to innovation, and\r\nwere seditious persons. He also put Cæsar in mind what difficult\r\nservices he had undergone when he assisted him in his wars, and\r\ndiscoursed about what he was a witness of himself. He added, that\r\nAristobulus was justly carried away to Rome, as one that was an enemy to\r\nthe Romans, and could never be brought to be a friend to them, and that\r\nhis brother had no more than he deserved from Scipio, as being seized in\r\ncommitting robberies; and that this punishment was not inflicted on him\r\nin a way of violence or injustice by him that did it.\r\n\r\n5. When Antipater had made this speech, Cæsar appointed Hyrcauus to be\r\nhigh priest, and gave Antipater what principality he himself should\r\nchoose, leaving the determination to himself; so he made him procurator\r\nof Judea. He also gave Hyrcanus leave to raise up the walls of his own\r\ncity, upon his asking that favor of him, for they had been demolished by\r\nPompey. And this grant he sent to the consuls to Rome, to be engraven in\r\nthe capitol. The decree of the senate was this that follows: 13 \"Lucius\r\nValerius, the son of Lucius the praetor, referred this to the senate,\r\nupon the Ides of December, in the temple of Concord. There were present\r\nat the writing of this decree Lucius Coponius, the son of Lucius of the\r\nColline tribe, and Papirius of the Quirine tribe, concerning the affairs\r\nwhich Alexander, the son of Jason, and Numenius, the son of Antiochus,\r\nand Alexander, the son of Dositheus, ambassadors of the Jews, good and\r\nworthy men, proposed, who came to renew that league of goodwill and\r\nfriendship with the Romans which was in being before. They also brought\r\na shield of gold, as a mark of confederacy, valued at fifty thousand\r\npieces of gold; and desired that letters might be given them, directed\r\nboth to the free cities and to the kings, that their country and their\r\nhavens might be at peace, and that no one among them might receive any\r\ninjury. It therefore pleased [the senate] to make a league of friendship\r\nand good-will with them, and to bestow on them whatsoever they stood in\r\nneed of, and to accept of the shield which was brought by them. This was\r\ndone in the ninth year of Hyrcanus the high priest and ethnarch, in the\r\nmonth Panemus.\" Hyrcanus also received honors from the people of Athens,\r\nas having been useful to them on many occasions. And when they wrote to\r\nhim, they sent him this decree, as it here follows \"Under the prutaneia\r\nand priesthood of Dionysius, the son of Esculapius, on the fifth day of\r\nthe latter part of the month Panemus, this decree of the Athenians was\r\ngiven to their commanders, when Agathocles was archon, and Eucles, the\r\nson of Menander of Alimusia, was the scribe. In the month Munychion, on\r\nthe eleventh day of the prutaneia, a council of the presidents was held\r\nin the theater. Dorotheus the high priest, and the fellow presidents\r\nwith him, put it to the vote of the people. Dionysius, the son of\r\nDionysius, gave the sentence. Since Hyrcanus, the son of Alexander, the\r\nhigh priest and ethnarch of the Jews, continues to bear good-will to our\r\npeople in general, and to every one of our citizens in particular, and\r\ntreats them with all sorts of kindness; and when any of the Athenians\r\ncome to him, either as ambassadors, or on any occasion of their own, he\r\nreceives them in an obliging manner, and sees that they are conducted\r\nback in safety, of which we have had several former testimonies; it is\r\nnow also decreed, at the report of Theodosius, the son of Theodorus, and\r\nupon his putting the people in mind of the virtue of this man, and that\r\nhis purpose is to do us all the good that is in his power, to honor him\r\nwith a crown of gold, the usual reward according to the law, and to\r\nerect his statue in brass in the temple of Demus and of the Graces; and\r\nthat this present of a crown shall be proclaimed publicly in the\r\ntheater, in the Dionysian shows, while the new tragedies are acting; and\r\nin the Panathenean, and Eleusinian, and Gymnical shows also; and that\r\nthe commanders shall take care, while he continues in his friendship,\r\nand preserves his good-will to us, to return all possible honor and\r\nfavor to the man for his affection and generosity; that by this\r\ntreatment it may appear how our people receive the good kindly, and\r\nrepay them a suitable reward; and he may be induced to proceed in his\r\naffection towards us, by the honors we have already paid him. That\r\nambassadors be also chosen out of all the Athenians, who shall carry\r\nthis decree to him, and desire him to accept of the honors we do him,\r\nand to endeavor always to be doing some good to our city.\" And this\r\nshall suffice us to have spoken as to the honors that were paid by the\r\nRomans and the people of Athens to Hyrcanus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. How Antipater Committed The Care Of Galilee To Herod, And\r\nThat Of Jerusalem To Phasaelus; As Also How Herod Upon The Jews' Envy At\r\nAntipater Was Accused Before Hyrcanus.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Cæsar had settled the affairs of Syria, he sailed away. And\r\nas soon as Antipater had conducted Cæsar out of Syria, he returned to\r\nJudea. He then immediately raised up the wall which had been thrown down\r\nby Pompey; and, by coming thither, he pacified that tumult which had\r\nbeen in the country, and this by both threatening and advising them to\r\nbe quiet; for that if they would be of Hyrcanus's side, they would live\r\nhappily, and lead their lives without disturbance, and in the enjoyment\r\nof their own possessions; but if they were addicted to the hopes of what\r\nmight come by innovation, and aimed to get wealth thereby, they should\r\nhave him a severe master instead of a gentle governor, and Hyrcanus a\r\ntyrant instead of a king, and the Romans, together with Cæsar, their\r\nbitter enemies instead of rulers, for that they would never bear him to\r\nbe set aside whom they had appointed to govern. And when Antipater had\r\nsaid this to them, he himself settled the affairs of this country.\r\n\r\n2. And seeing that Hyrcanus was of a slow and slothful temper, he made\r\nPhasaelus, his eldest son, governor of Jerusalem, and of the places that\r\nwere about it, but committed Galilee to Herod, his next son, who was\r\nthen a very young man, for he was but fifteen years of age 14 But that\r\nyouth of his was no impediment to him; but as he was a youth of great\r\nmind, he presently met with an opportunity of signalizing his courage;\r\nfor finding that there was one Hezekiah, a captain of a band of robbers,\r\nwho overran the neighboring parts of Syria with a great troop of them,\r\nhe seized him and slew him, as well as a great number of the other\r\nrobbers that were with him; for which action he was greatly beloved by\r\nthe Syrians; for when they were very desirous to have their country\r\nfreed from this nest of robbers, he purged it of them. So they sung\r\nsongs in his commendation in their villages and cities, as having\r\nprocured them peace, and the secure enjoyment of their possessions; and\r\non this account it was that he became known to Sextus Cæsar, who was a\r\nrelation of the great Cæsar, and was now president of Syria. Now\r\nPhasaelus, Herod's brother, was moved with emulation at his actions, and\r\nenvied the fame he had thereby gotten, and became ambitious not to be\r\nbehindhand with him in deserving it. So he made the inhabitants of\r\nJerusalem bear him the greatest good-will while he held the city\r\nhimself, but did neither manage its affairs improperly, nor abuse his\r\nauthority therein. This conduct procured from the nation to Antipater\r\nsuch respect as is due to kings, and such honors as he might partake of\r\nif he were an absolute lord of the country. Yet did not this splendor of\r\nhis, as frequently happens, in the least diminish in him that kindness\r\nand fidelity which he owed to Hyrcanus.\r\n\r\n3. But now the principal men among the Jews, when they saw Antipater and\r\nhis sons to grow so much in the good-will the nation bare to them, and\r\nin the revenues which they received out of Judea, and out of Hyrcanus's\r\nown wealth, they became ill- disposed to him; for indeed Antipater had\r\ncontracted a friendship with the Roman emperors; and when he had\r\nprevailed with Hyrcanus to send them money, he took it to himself, and\r\npurloined the present intended, and sent it as if it were his own, and\r\nnot Hyrcanus's gift to them. Hyrcanus heard of this his management, but\r\ntook no care about it; nay, he rather was very glad of it. But the chief\r\nmen of the Jews were therefore in fear, because they saw that Herod was\r\na violent and bold man, and very desirous of acting tyrannically; so\r\nthey came to Hyrcanus, and now accused Antipater openly, and said to\r\nhim, \"How long wilt thou be quiet under such actions as are now done? Or\r\ndost thou not see that Antipater and his sons have already seized upon\r\nthe government, and that it is only the name of a king which is given\r\nthee? But do not thou suffer these things to be hidden from thee, nor do\r\nthou think to escape danger by being so careless of thyself and of thy\r\nkingdom; for Antipater and his sons are not now stewards of thine\r\naffairs: do not thou deceive thyself with such a notion; they are\r\nevidently absolute lords; for Herod, Antipater's son, hath slain\r\nHezekiah, and those that were with him, and hath thereby transgressed\r\nour law, which hath forbidden to slay any man, even though he were a\r\nwicked man, unless he had been first condemned to suffer death by the\r\nSanhedrim 15 yet hath he been so insolent as to do this, and that\r\nwithout any authority from thee.\"\r\n\r\n4. Upon Hyrcanus hearing this, he complied with them. The mothers also\r\nof those that had been slain by Herod raised his indignation; for those\r\nwomen continued every day in the temple, persuading the king and the\r\npeople that Herod might undergo a trial before the Sanhedrim for what he\r\nhad done. Hyrcanus was so moved by these complaints, that he summoned\r\nHerod to come to his trial for what was charged upon him. Accordingly he\r\ncame; but his father had persuaded him to come not like a private man,\r\nbut with a guard, for the security of his person; and that when he had\r\nsettled the affairs of Galilee in the best manner he could for his own\r\nadvantage, he should come to his trial, but still with a body of men\r\nsufficient for his security on his journey, yet so that he should not\r\ncome with so great a force as might look like terrifying Hyrcanus, but\r\nstill such a one as might not expose him naked and unguarded [to his\r\nenemies.] However, Sextus Cæsar, president of Syria, wrote to Hyrcanus,\r\nand desired him to clear Herod, and dismiss him at his trial, and\r\nthreatened him beforehand if he did not do it. Which epistle of his was\r\nthe occasion of Hyrcanus delivering Herod from suffering any harm from\r\nthe Sanhedrim, for he loved him as his own son. But when Herod stood\r\nbefore the Sanhedrim, with his body of men about him, he affrighted them\r\nall, and no one of his former accusers durst after that bring any charge\r\nagainst him, but there was a deep silence, and nobody knew what was to\r\nbe done. When affairs stood thus, one whose name was Sameas, 16 a\r\nrighteous man he was, and for that reason above all fear, rose up, and\r\nsaid, \"O you that are assessors with me, and O thou that art our king, I\r\nneither have ever myself known such a case, nor do I suppose that any\r\none of you can name its parallel, that one who is called to take his\r\ntrial by us ever stood in such a manner before us; but every one,\r\nwhosoever he be, that comes to be tried by this Sanhedrim, presents\r\nhimself in a submissive manner, and like one that is in fear of himself,\r\nand that endeavors to move us to compassion, with his hair dishevelled,\r\nand in a black and mourning garment: but this admirable man Herod, who\r\nis accused of murder, and called to answer so heavy an accusation,\r\nstands here clothed in purple, and with the hair of his head finely\r\ntrimmed, and with his armed men about him, that if we shall condemn him\r\nby our law, he may slay us, and by overbearing justice may himself\r\nescape death. Yet do not I make this complaint against Herod himself; he\r\nis to be sure more concerned for himself than for the laws; but my\r\ncomplaint is against yourselves, and your king, who gave him a license\r\nso to do. However, take you notice, that God is great, and that this\r\nvery man, whom you are going to absolve and dismiss, for the sake of\r\nHyrcanus, will one day punish both you and your king himself also.\" Nor\r\ndid Sameas mistake in any part of this prediction; for when Herod had\r\nreceived the kingdom, he slew all the members of this Sanhedrim, and\r\nHyrcanus himself also, excepting Sameas, for he had a great honor for\r\nhim on account of his righteousness, and because, when the city was\r\nafterward besieged by Herod and Sosius, he persuaded the people to admit\r\nHerod into it; and told them that for their sins they would not be able\r\nto escape his hands:—which things will be related by us in their proper\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n5. But when Hyrcanus saw that the members of the Sanhedrim were ready to\r\npronounce the sentence of death upon Herod, he put off the trial to\r\nanother day, and sent privately to Herod, and advised him to fly out of\r\nthe city, for that by this means he might escape. So he retired to\r\nDamascus, as though he fled from the king; and when he had been with\r\nSextus Cæsar, and had put his own affairs in a sure posture, he resolved\r\nto do thus; that in case he were again summoned before the Sanhedrim to\r\ntake his trial, he would not obey that summons. Hereupon the members of\r\nthe Sanhedrim had great indignation at this posture of affairs, and\r\nendeavored to persuade Hyrcanus that all these things were against him;\r\nwhich state of matters he was not ignorant of; but his temper was so\r\nunmanly, and so foolish, that he was able to do nothing at all. But when\r\nSextus had made Herod general of the army of Celesyria, for he sold him\r\nthat post for money, Hyrcanus was in fear lest Herod should make war\r\nupon him; nor was the effect of what he feared long in coming upon him;\r\nfor Herod came and brought an army along with him to fight with\r\nHyrcanus, as being angry at the trial he had been summoned to undergo\r\nbefore the Sanhedrim; but his father Antipater, and his brother\r\n[Phasaelus], met him, and hindered him from assaulting Jerusalem. They\r\nalso pacified his vehement temper, and persuaded him to do no overt\r\naction, but only to affright them with threatenings, and to proceed no\r\nfurther against one who had given him the dignity he had: they also\r\ndesired him not only to be angry that he was summoned, and obliged to\r\ncome to his trial, but to remember withal how he was dismissed without\r\ncondemnation, and how he ought to give Hyrcanus thanks for the same; and\r\nthat he was not to regard only what was disagreeable to him, and be\r\nunthankful for his deliverance. So they desired him to consider, that\r\nsince it is God that turns the scales of war, there is great uncertainty\r\nin the issue of battles, and that therefore he ought of to expect the\r\nvictory when he should fight with his king, and him that had supported\r\nhim, and bestowed many benefits upon him, and had done nothing itself\r\nvery severe to him; for that his accusation, which was derived from evil\r\ncounselors, and not from himself, had rather the suspicion of some\r\nseverity, than any thing really severe in it. Herod was persuaded by\r\nthese arguments, and believed that it was sufficient for his future\r\nhopes to have made a show of his strength before the nation, and done no\r\nmore to it—and in this state were the affairs of Judea at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. The Honors That Were Paid The Jews; And The Leagues That\r\nWere Made By The Romans And Other Nations, With Them.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Cæsar was come to Rome, he was ready to sail into Africa to\r\nfight against Scipio and Cato, when Hyrcanus sent ambassadors to him,\r\nand by them desired that he would ratify that league of friendship and\r\nmutual alliance which was between them, And it seems to me to be\r\nnecessary here to give an account of all the honors that the Romans and\r\ntheir emperor paid to our nation, and of the leagues of mutual\r\nassistance they have made with it, that all the rest of mankind may know\r\nwhat regard the kings of Asia and Europe have had to us, and that they\r\nhave been abundantly satisfied of our courage and fidelity; for whereas\r\nmany will not believe what hath been written about us by the Persians\r\nand Macedonians, because those writings are not every where to be met\r\nwith, nor do lie in public places, but among us ourselves, and certain\r\nother barbarous nations, while there is no contradiction to be made\r\nagainst the decrees of the Romans, for they are laid up in the public\r\nplaces of the cities, and are extant still in the capitol, and engraven\r\nupon pillars of brass; nay, besides this, Julius Cæsar made a pillar of\r\nbrass for the Jews at Alexandria, and declared publicly that they were\r\ncitizens of Alexandria. Out of these evidences will I demonstrate what I\r\nsay; and will now set down the decrees made both by the senate and by\r\nJulius Cæsar, which relate to Hyrcanus and to our nation.\r\n\r\n2. \"Caius Julius Cæsar, imperator and high priest, and dictator the\r\nsecond time, to the magistrates, senate, and people of Sidon, sendeth\r\ngreeting. If you be in health, it is well. I also and the army are well.\r\nI have sent you a copy of that decree, registered on the tables, which\r\nconcerns Hyrcanus, the son of Alexander, the high priest and ethnarch of\r\nthe Jews, that it may be laid up among the public records; and I will\r\nthat it be openly proposed in a table of brass, both in Greek and in\r\nLatin. It is as follows: I Julius Cæsar, imperator the second time, and\r\nhigh priest, have made this decree, with the approbation of the senate.\r\nWhereas Hyrcanus, the son of Alexander the Jew, hath demonstrated his\r\nfidelity and diligence about our affairs, and this both now and in\r\nformer times, both in peace and in war, as many of our generals have\r\nborne witness, and came to our assistance in the last Alexandrian war,\r\n17 with fifteen hundred soldiers; and when he was sent by me to\r\nMithridates, showed himself superior in valor to all the rest of that\r\narmy;—for these reasons I will that Hyrcanus, the son of Alexander, and\r\nhis children, be ethnarchs of the Jews, and have the high priesthood of\r\nthe Jews for ever, according to the customs of their forefathers, and\r\nthat he and his sons be our confederates; and that besides this,\r\neveryone of them be reckoned among our particular friends. I also ordain\r\nthat he and his children retain whatsoever privileges belong to the\r\noffice of high priest, or whatsoever favors have been hitherto granted\r\nthem; and if at any time hereafter there arise any questions about the\r\nJewish customs, I will that he determine the same. And I think it not\r\nproper that they should be obliged to find us winter quarters, or that\r\nany money should be required of them.\"\r\n\r\n3. \"The decrees of Caius Cæsar, consul, containing what hath been\r\ngranted and determined, are as follows: That Hyrcanus and his children\r\nbear rule over the nation of the Jews, and have the profits of the\r\nplaces to them bequeathed; and that he, as himself the high priest and\r\nethnarch of the Jews, defend those that are injured; and that\r\nambassadors be sent to Hyrcanus, the son of Alexander, the high priest\r\nof the Jews, that may discourse with him about a league of friendship\r\nand mutual assistance; and that a table of brass, containing the\r\npremises, be openly proposed in the capitol, and at Sidon, and Tyre, and\r\nAskelon, and in the temple, engraven in Roman and Greek letters: that\r\nthis decree may also be communicated to the quaestors and praetors of\r\nthe several cities, and to the friends of the Jews; and that the\r\nambassadors may have presents made them; and that these decrees be sent\r\nevery where.\" 18\r\n\r\n4. \"Caius Cæsar, imperator, dictator, consul, hath granted, That out of\r\nregard to the honor, and virtue, and kindness of the man, and for the\r\nadvantage of the senate, and of the people of Rome, Hyrcanus, the son of\r\nAlexander, both he and his children, be high priests and priests of\r\nJerusalem, and of the Jewish nation, by the same right, and according to\r\nthe same laws, by which their progenitors have held the priesthood.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"Caius Cæsar, consul the fifth time, hath decreed, That the Jews\r\nshall possess Jerusalem, and may encompass that city with walls; and\r\nthat Hyrcanus, the son of Alexander, the high priest and ethnarch of the\r\nJews, retain it in the manner he himself pleases; and that the Jews be\r\nallowed to deduct out of their tribute, every second year the land is\r\nlet [in the Sabbatic period], a corus of that tribute; and that the\r\ntribute they pay be not let to farm, nor that they pay always the same\r\ntribute.\"\r\n\r\n6. \"Caius Cæsar, imperator the second time, hath ordained, That all the\r\ncountry of the Jews, excepting Joppa, do pay a tribute yearly for the\r\ncity Jerusalem, excepting the seventh, which they call the sabbatical\r\nyear, because thereon they neither receive the fruits of their trees,\r\nnor do they sow their land; and that they pay their tribute in Sidon on\r\nthe second year [of that sabbatical period], the fourth part of what was\r\nsown: and besides this, they are to pay the same tithes to Hyrcanus and\r\nhis sons which they paid to their forefathers. And that no one, neither\r\npresident, nor lieutenant, nor ambassador, raise auxiliaries within the\r\nbounds of Judea; nor may soldiers exact money of them for winter\r\nquarters, or under any other pretense; but that they be free from all\r\nsorts of injuries; and that whatsoever they shall hereafter have, and\r\nare in possession of, or have bought, they shall retain them all. It is\r\nalso our pleasure that the city Joppa, which the Jews had originally,\r\nwhen they made a league of friendship with the Romans, shall belong to\r\nthem, as it formerly did; and that Hyrcanus, the son of Alexander, and\r\nhis sons, have as tribute of that city from those that occupy the land\r\nfor the country, and for what they export every year to Sidon, twenty\r\nthousand six hundred and seventy-five modii every year, the seventh\r\nyear, which they call the Sabbatic year, excepted, whereon they neither\r\nplough, nor receive the product of their trees. It is also the pleasure\r\nof the senate, that as to the villages which are in the great plain,\r\nwhich Hyrcanus and his forefathers formerly possessed, Hyrcanus and the\r\nJews have them with the same privileges with which they formerly had\r\nthem also; and that the same original ordinances remain still in force\r\nwhich concern the Jews with regard to their high priests; and that they\r\nenjoy the same benefits which they have had formerly by the concession\r\nof the people, and of the senate; and let them enjoy the like privileges\r\nin Lydda. It is the pleasure also of the senate that Hyrcanus the\r\nethnarch, and the Jews, retain those places, countries, and villages\r\nwhich belonged to the kings of Syria and Phoenicia, the confederates of\r\nthe Romans, and which they had bestowed on them as their free gifts. It\r\nis also granted to Hyrcanus, and to his sons, and to the ambassadors by\r\nthem sent to us, that in the fights between single gladiators, and in\r\nthose with beasts, they shall sit among the senators to see those shows;\r\nand that when they desire an audience, they shall be introduced into the\r\nsenate by the dictator, or by the general of the horse; and when they\r\nhave introduced them, their answers shall be returned them in ten days\r\nat the furthest, after the decree of the senate is made about their\r\naffairs.\"\r\n\r\n7. \"Caius Cæsar, imperator, dictator the fourth time, and consul the\r\nfifth time, declared to be perpetual dictator, made this speech\r\nconcerning the rights and privileges of Hyrcanus, the son of Alexander,\r\nthe high priest and ethnarch of the Jews. Since those imperators that\r\nhave been in the provinces before me have borne witness to Hyrcanus, the\r\nhigh priest of the Jews, and to the Jews themselves, and this before the\r\nsenate and people of Rome, when the people and senate returned their\r\nthanks to them, it is good that we now also remember the same, and\r\nprovide that a requital be made to Hyrcanus, to the nation of the Jews,\r\nand to the sons of Hyrcanus, by the senate and people of Rome, and that\r\nsuitably to what good-will they have shown us, and to the benefits they\r\nhave bestowed upon us.\"\r\n\r\n8. \"Julius Caius, praetor [consul] of Rome, to the magistrates, senate,\r\nand people of the Parians, sendeth greeting. The Jews of Delos, and some\r\nother Jews that sojourn there, in the presence of your ambassadors,\r\nsignified to us, that, by a decree of yours, you forbid them to make use\r\nof the customs of their forefathers, and their way of sacred worship.\r\nNow it does not please me that such decrees should be made against our\r\nfriends and confederates, whereby they are forbidden to live according\r\nto their own customs, or to bring in contributions for common suppers\r\nand holy festivals, while they are not forbidden so to do even at Rome\r\nitself; for even Caius Cæsar, our imperator and consul, in that decree\r\nwherein he forbade the Bacchanal rioters to meet in the city, did yet\r\npermit these Jews, and these only, both to bring in their contributions,\r\nand to make their common suppers. Accordingly, when I forbid other\r\nBacchanal rioters, I permit these Jews to gather themselves together,\r\naccording to the customs and laws of their forefathers, and to persist\r\ntherein. It will be therefore good for you, that if you have made any\r\ndecree against these our friends and confederates, to abrogate the same,\r\nby reason of their virtue and kind disposition towards us.\"\r\n\r\n9. Now after Caius was slain, when Marcus Antonius and Publius Dolabella\r\nwere consuls, they both assembled the senate, and introduced Hyrcanus's\r\nambassadors into it, and discoursed of what they desired, and made a\r\nleague of friendship with them. The senate also decreed to grant them\r\nall they desired. I add the decree itself, that those who read the\r\npresent work may have ready by them a demonstration of the truth of what\r\nwe say. The decree was this:\r\n\r\n10. \"The decree of the senate, copied out of the treasury, from the\r\npublic tables belonging to the quaestors, when Quintus Rutilius and\r\nCaius Cornelius were quaestors, and taken out of the second table of the\r\nfirst class, on the third day before the Ides of April, in the temple of\r\nConcord. There were present at the writing of this decree, Lucius\r\nCalpurnius Piso of the Menenian tribe, Servius Papinins Potitus of the\r\nLemonian tribe, Caius Caninius Rebilius of the Terentine tribe, Publius\r\nTidetius, Lucius Apulinus, the son of Lucius, of the Sergian tribe,\r\nFlavius, the son of Lucius, of the Lemonian tribe, Publius Platins, the\r\nson of Publius, of the Papyrian tribe, Marcus Acilius, the son of\r\nMarcus, of the Mecian tribe, Lucius Erucius, the son of Lucius, of the\r\nStellatine tribe, Mareils Quintus Plancillus, the son of Marcus, of the\r\nPollian tribe, and Publius Serius. Publius Dolabella and Marcus\r\nAntonius, the consuls, made this reference to the senate, that as to\r\nthose things which, by the decree of the senate, Caius Cæsar had\r\nadjudged about the Jews, and yet had not hitherto that decree been\r\nbrought into the treasury, it is our will, as it is also the desire of\r\nPublius Dolabella and Marcus Antonius, our consuls, to have these\r\ndecrees put into the public tables, and brought to the city quaestors,\r\nthat they may take care to have them put upon the double tables. This\r\nwas done before the fifth of the Ides of February, in the temple of\r\nConcord. Now the ambassadors from Hyrcanus the high priest were these:\r\nLysimachus, the son of Pausanias, Alexander, the son of Theodorus,\r\nPatroclus, the son of Chereas, and Jonathan the son of Onias.\"\r\n\r\n11. Hyrcanus sent also one of these ambassadors to Dolabella, who was\r\nthen the prefect of Asia, and desired him to dismiss the Jews from\r\nmilitary services, and to preserve to them the customs of their\r\nforefathers, and to permit them to live according to them. And when\r\nDolabella had received Hyrcanus's letter, without any further\r\ndeliberation, he sent an epistle to all the Asiatics, and particularly\r\nto the city of the Ephesians, the metropolis of Asia, about the Jews; a\r\ncopy of which epistle here follows:\r\n\r\n12. \"When Artermon was prytanis, on the first day of the month Leneon,\r\nDolabella, imperator, to the senate, and magistrates, and people of the\r\nEphesians, sendeth greeting. Alexander, the son of Theodorus, the\r\nambassador of Hyrcanus, the son of Alexander, the high priest and\r\nethnarch of the Jews, appeared before me, to show that his countrymen\r\ncould not go into their armies, because they are not allowed to bear\r\narms or to travel on the sabbath days, nor there to procure themselves\r\nthose sorts of food which they have been used to eat from the times of\r\ntheir forefathers;—I do therefore grant them a freedom from going into\r\nthe army, as the former prefects have done, and permit them to use the\r\ncustoms of their forefathers, in assembling together for sacred and\r\nreligious purposes, as their law requires, and for collecting oblations\r\nnecessary for sacrifices; and my will is, that you write this to the\r\nseveral cities under your jurisdiction.\"\r\n\r\n13. And these were the concessions that Dolabella made to our nation\r\nwhen Hyrcanus sent an embassage to him. But Lucius the consul's decree\r\nran thus: \"I have at my tribunal set these Jews, who are citizens of\r\nRome, and follow the Jewish religious rites, and yet live at Ephesus,\r\nfree from going into the army, on account of the superstition they are\r\nunder. This was done before the twelfth of the calends of October, when\r\nLucius Lentulus and Caius Marcellus were consuls, in the presence of\r\nTitus Appius Balgus, the son of Titus, and lieutenant of the Horatian\r\ntribe; of Titus Tongins, the son of Titus, of the Crustumine tribe; of\r\nQuintus Resius, the son of Quintus; of Titus Pompeius Longinus, the son\r\nof Titus; of Catus Servilius, the son of Caius, of the Terentine tribe;\r\nof Bracchus the military tribune; of Publius Lucius Gallus, the son of\r\nPublius, of the Veturian tribe; of Caius Sentins, the son of Caius, of\r\nthe Sabbatine tribe; of Titus Atilius Bulbus, the son of Titus,\r\nlieutenant and vice-praetor to the magistrates, senate, and people of\r\nthe Ephesians, sendeth greeting. Lucius Lentulus the consul freed the\r\nJews that are in Asia from going into the armies, at my intercession for\r\nthem; and when I had made the same petition some time afterward to\r\nPhanius the imperator, and to Lucius Antonius the vice-quaestor, I\r\nobtained that privilege of them also; and my will is, that you take care\r\nthat no one give them any disturbance.\"\r\n\r\n14. The decree of the Delians. \"The answer of the praetors, when Beotus\r\nwas archon, on the twentieth day of the month Thargeleon. While Marcus\r\nPiso the lieutenant lived in our city, who was also appointed over the\r\nchoice of the soldiers, he called us, and many other of the citizens,\r\nand gave order, that if there be here any Jews who are Roman citizens,\r\nno one is to give them any disturbance about going into the army,\r\nbecause Cornelius Lentulus, the consul, freed the Jews from going into\r\nthe army, on account of the superstition they are under;—you are\r\ntherefore obliged to submit to the praetor.\" And the like decree was\r\nmade by the Sardians about us also.\r\n\r\n15. \"Caius Phanius, the son of Caius, imperator and consul, to the\r\nmagistrates of Cos, sendeth greeting. I would have you know that the\r\nambassadors of the Jews have been with me, and desired they might have\r\nthose decrees which the senate had made about them; which decrees are\r\nhere subjoined. My will is, that you have a regard to and take care of\r\nthese men, according to the senate's decree, that they may be safely\r\nconveyed home through your country.\"\r\n\r\n16. The declaration of Lucius Lentulus the consul: \"I have dismissed\r\nthose Jews who are Roman citizens, and who appear to me to have their\r\nreligious rites, and to observe the laws of the Jews at Ephesus, on\r\naccount of the superstition they are under. This act was done before the\r\nthirteenth of the calends of October.\"\r\n\r\n17. \"Lucius Antonius, the son of Marcus, vice-quaestor, and vice-\r\npraetor, to the magistrates, senate, and people of the Sardians, sendeth\r\ngreeting. Those Jews that are our fellow citizens of Rome came to me,\r\nand demonstrated that they had an assembly of their own, according to\r\nthe laws of their forefathers, and this from the beginning, as also a\r\nplace of their own, wherein they determined their suits and\r\ncontroversies with one another. Upon their petition therefore to me,\r\nthat these might be lawful for them, I gave order that these their\r\nprivileges be preserved, and they be permitted to do accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n18. The declaration of Marcus Publius, the son of Spurius, and of\r\nMarcus, the son of Marcus, and of Lucius, the son of Publius: \"We went\r\nto the proconsul, and informed him of what Dositheus, the son of\r\nCleopatrida of Alexandria, desired, that, if he thought good, he would\r\ndismiss those Jews who were Roman citizens, and were wont to observe the\r\nrites of the Jewish religion, on account of the superstition they were\r\nunder. Accordingly, he did dismiss them. This was done before the\r\nthirteenth of the calends of October.\"\r\n\r\n19. \"In the month Quntius, when Lucius Lentulus and Caius Mercellus were\r\nconsuls; and there were present Titus Appius Balbus, the son of Titus,\r\nlieutenant of the Horatian tribe, Titus Tongius of the Crustumine tribe,\r\nQuintus Resius, the son of Quintus, Titus Pompeius, the son of Titus,\r\nCornelius Longinus, Caius Servilius Bracchus, the son of Caius, a\r\nmilitary tribune, of the Terentine tribe, Publius Clusius Gallus, the\r\nson of Publius, of the Veturian tribe, Caius Teutius, the son of Caius,\r\na milital tribune, of the EmilJan tribe, Sextus Atilius Serranus, the\r\nson of Sextus, of the Esquiline tribe, Caius Pompeius, the son of Caius,\r\nof the Sabbatine tribe, Titus Appius Menander, the son of Titus, Publius\r\nServilius Strabo, the son of Publius, Lucius Paccius Capito, the son of\r\nLucius, of the Colline tribe, Aulus Furius Tertius, the son of Aulus,\r\nand Appius Menus. In the presence of these it was that Lentulus\r\npronounced this decree: I have before the tribunal dismissed those Jews\r\nthat are Roman citizens, and are accustomed to observe the sacred rites\r\nof the Jews at Ephesus, on account of the superstition they are under.\"\r\n\r\n20. \"The magistrates of the Laodiceans to Caius Rubilius, the son of\r\nCaius, the consul, sendeth greeting. Sopater, the ambassador of Hyrcanus\r\nthe high priest, hath delivered us an epistle from thee, whereby he lets\r\nus know that certain ambassadors were come from Hyrcanus, the high\r\npriest of the Jews, and brought an epistle written concerning their\r\nnation, wherein they desire that the Jews may be allowed to observe\r\ntheir Sabbaths, and other sacred rites, according to the laws of their\r\nforefathers, and that they may be under no command, because they are our\r\nfriends and confederates, and that nobody may injure them in our\r\nprovinces. Now although the Trallians there present contradicted them,\r\nand were not pleased with these decrees, yet didst thou give order that\r\nthey should be observed, and informedst us that thou hadst been desired\r\nto write this to us about them. We therefore, in obedience to the\r\ninjunctions we have received from thee, have received the epistle which\r\nthou sentest us, and have laid it up by itself among our public records.\r\nAnd as to the other things about which thou didst send to us, we will\r\ntake care that no complaint be made against us.\"\r\n\r\n21. \"Publius Servilius, the son of Publius, of the Galban tribe, the\r\nproconsul, to the magistrates, senate, and people of the Milesians,\r\nsendeth greeting. Prytanes, the son of Hermes, a citizen of yours, came\r\nto me when I was at Tralles, and held a court there, and informed me\r\nthat you used the Jews in a way different from my opinion, and forbade\r\nthem to celebrate their Sabbaths, and to perform the Sacred rites\r\nreceived from their forefathers, and to manage the fruits of the land,\r\naccording to their ancient custom; and that he had himself been the\r\npromulger of your decree, according as your laws require: I would\r\ntherefore have you know, that upon hearing the pleadings on both sides,\r\nI gave sentence that the Jews should not be prohibited to make use of\r\ntheir own customs.\"\r\n\r\n22. The decree of those of Pergamus. \"When Cratippus was prytanis, on\r\nthe first day of the month Desius, the decree of the praetors was this:\r\nSince the Romans, following the conduct of their ancestors, undertake\r\ndangers for the common safety of all mankind, and are ambitious to\r\nsettle their confederates and friends in happiness, and in firm peace,\r\nand since the nation of the Jews, and their high priest Hyrcanus, sent\r\nas ambassadors to them, Strato, the son of Theodatus, and Apollonius,\r\nthe son of Alexander, and Eneas, the son of Antipater, and Aristobulus,\r\nthe son of Amyntas, and Sosipater, the son of Philip, worthy and good\r\nmen, who gave a particular account of their affairs, the senate\r\nthereupon made a decree about what they had desired of them, that\r\nAntiochus the king, the son of Antiochus, should do no injury to the\r\nJews, the confederates of the Romans; and that the fortresses, and the\r\nhavens, and the country, and whatsoever else he had taken from them,\r\nshould be restored to them; and that it may be lawful for them to export\r\ntheir goods out of their own havens; and that no king nor people may\r\nhave leave to export any goods, either out of the country of Judea, or\r\nout of their havens, without paying customs, but only Ptolemy, the king\r\nof Alexandria, because he is our confederate and friend; and that,\r\naccording to their desire, the garrison that is in Joppa may be ejected.\r\nNow Lucius Pettius, one of our senators, a worthy and good man, gave\r\norder that we should take care that these things should be done\r\naccording to the senate's decree; and that we should take care also that\r\ntheir ambassadors might return home in safety. Accordingly, we admitted\r\nTheodorus into our senate and assembly, and took the epistle out his\r\nhands, as well as the decree of the senate. And as he discoursed with\r\ngreat zeal about the Jews, and described Hyrcanus's virtue and\r\ngenerosity, and how he was a benefactor to all men in common, and\r\nparticularly to every body that comes to him, we laid up the epistle in\r\nour public records; and made a decree ourselves, that since we also are\r\nin confederacy with the Romans, we would do every thing we could for the\r\nJews, according to the senate's decree. Theodorus also, who brought the\r\nepistle, desired of our praetors, that they would send Hyrcanus a copy\r\nof that decree, as also ambassadors to signify to him the affection of\r\nour people to him, and to exhort them to preserve and augment their\r\nfriendship for us, and be ready to bestow other benefits upon us, as\r\njustly expecting to receive proper requitals from us; and desiring them\r\nto remember that our ancestors 19 were friendly to the Jews even in the\r\ndays of Abraham, who was the father of all the Hebrews, as we have\r\n[also] found it set down in our public records.\"\r\n\r\n23. The decree of those of Halicarnassus. \"When Memnon, the son of\r\nOrestidas by descent, but by adoption of Euonymus, was priest, on the ——\r\nday of the month Aristerion, the decree of the people, upon the\r\nrepresentation of Marcus Alexander, was this: Since we have ever a great\r\nregard to piety towards God, and to holiness; and since we aim to follow\r\nthe people of the Romans, who are the benefactors of all men, and what\r\nthey have written to us about a league of friendship and mutual\r\nassistance between the Jews and our city, and that their sacred offices\r\nand accustomed festivals and assemblies may be observed by them; we have\r\ndecreed, that as many men and women of the Jews as are willing so to do,\r\nmay celebrate their Sabbaths, and perform their holy offices, according\r\nto Jewish laws; and may make their proseuchae at the sea-side, according\r\nto the customs of their forefathers; and if any one, whether he be a\r\nmagistrate or private person, hindereth them from so doing, he shall be\r\nliable to a fine, to be applied to the uses of the city.\"\r\n\r\n24. The decree of the Sardians. \"This decree was made by the senate and\r\npeople, upon the representation of the praetors: Whereas those Jews who\r\nare fellow citizens, and live with us in this city, have ever had great\r\nbenefits heaped upon them by the people, and have come now into the\r\nsenate, and desired of the people, that upon the restitution of their\r\nlaw and their liberty, by the senate and people of Rome, they may\r\nassemble together, according to their ancient legal custom, and that we\r\nwill not bring any suit against them about it; and that a place may be\r\ngiven them where they may have their congregations, with their wives and\r\nchildren, and may offer, as did their forefathers, their prayers and\r\nsacrifices to God. Now the senate and people have decreed to permit them\r\nto assemble together on the days formerly appointed, and to act\r\naccording to their own laws; and that such a place be set apart for them\r\nby the praetors, for the building and inhabiting the same, as they shall\r\nesteem fit for that purpose; and that those that take care of the\r\nprovision for the city, shall take care that such sorts of food as they\r\nesteem fit for their eating may be imported into the city.\"\r\n\r\n25. The decree of the Ephesians. \"When Menophilus was prytanis, on the\r\nfirst day of the month Artemisius, this decree was made by the people:\r\nNicanor, the son of Euphemus, pronounced it, upon the representation of\r\nthe praetors. Since the Jews that dwell in this city have petitioned\r\nMarcus Julius Pompeius, the son of Brutus, the proconsul, that they\r\nmight be allowed to observe their Sabbaths, and to act in all things\r\naccording to the customs of their forefathers, without impediment from\r\nany body, the praetor hath granted their petition. Accordingly, it was\r\ndecreed by the senate and people, that in this affair that concerned the\r\nRomans, no one of them should be hindered from keeping the sabbath day,\r\nnor be fined for so doing, but that they may be allowed to do all things\r\naccording to their own laws.\"\r\n\r\n26. Now there are many such decrees of the senate and imperators of the\r\nRomans 20 and those different from these before us, which have been made\r\nin favor of Hyrcanus, and of our nation; as also, there have been more\r\ndecrees of the cities, and rescripts of the praetors, to such epistles\r\nas concerned our rights and privileges; and certainly such as are not\r\nill-disposed to what we write may believe that they are all to this\r\npurpose, and that by the specimens which we have inserted; for since we\r\nhave produced evident marks that may still be seen of the friendship we\r\nhave had with the Romans, and demonstrated that those marks are engraven\r\nupon columns and tables of brass in the capitol, that axe still in\r\nbeing, and preserved to this day, we have omitted to set them all down,\r\nas needless and disagreeable; for I cannot suppose any one so perverse\r\nas not to believe the friendship we have had with the Romans, while they\r\nhave demonstrated the same by such a great number of their decrees\r\nrelating to us; nor will they doubt of our fidelity as to the rest of\r\nthose decrees, since we have shown the same in those we have produced,\r\nAnd thus have we sufficiently explained that friendship and confederacy\r\nwe at those times had with the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. How Marcus, Succeeded Sextus When He Had Been Slain By\r\nBassus's Treachery; And How, After The Death Of Cæsar, Cassius Came Into\r\nSyria, And Distressed Judea; As Also How Malichus Slew Antipater And Was\r\nHimself Slain By Herod.\r\n\r\n1. Now it so fell out, that about this very time the affairs of Syria\r\nwere in great disorder, and this on the occasion following: Cecilius\r\nBassus, one of Pompey's party, laid a treacherous design against Sextus\r\nCæsar, and slew him, and then took his army, and got the management of\r\npublic affairs into his own hand; so there arose a great war about\r\nApamia, while Cæsar's generals came against him with an army of horsemen\r\nand footmen; to these Antipater also sent succors, and his sons with\r\nthem, as calling to mind the kindnesses they had received from Cæsar,\r\nand on that account he thought it but just to require punishment for\r\nhim, and to take vengeance on the man that had murdered him. And as the\r\nwar was drawn out into a great length, Marcus 21 came from Rome to take\r\nSextus's government upon him. But Cæsar was slain by Cassius and Brutus\r\nin the senate-house, after he had retained the government three years\r\nand six months. This fact however, is related elsewhere.\r\n\r\n2. As the war that arose upon the death of Cæsar was now begun, and the\r\nprincipal men were all gone, some one way, and some another, to raise\r\narmies, Cassius came from Rome into Syria, in order to receive the [army\r\nthat lay in the] camp at Apamia; and having raised the siege, he brought\r\nover both Bassus and Marcus to his party. He then went over the cities,\r\nand got together weapons and soldiers, and laid great taxes upon those\r\ncities; and he chiefly oppressed Judea, and exacted of it seven hundred\r\ntalents: but Antipater, when he saw the state to be in so great\r\nconsternation and disorder, he divided the collection of that sum, and\r\nappointed his two sons to gather it; and so that part of it was to be\r\nexacted by Malichus, who was ill- disposed to him, and part by others.\r\nAnd because Herod did exact what is required of him from Galilee before\r\nothers, he was in the greatest favor with Cassius; for he thought it a\r\npart of prudence to cultivate a friendship with the Romans, and to gain\r\ntheir goodwill at the expense of others; whereas the curators of the\r\nother cities, with their citizens, were sold for slaves; and Cassius\r\nreduced four cities into a state of slavery, the two most potent of\r\nwhich were Gophna and Emmaus; and, besides these, Lydia and Thamna. Nay,\r\nCassius was so very angry at Malichus, that he had killed him, [for he\r\nassaulted him,] had not Hyrcanus, by the means of Antipater, sent him a\r\nhundred talents of his own, and thereby pacified his anger against him.\r\n\r\n3. But after Cassius was gone out of Judea, Malichus laid snares for\r\nAntipater, as thinking that his death would-be the preservation of\r\nHyrcanus's government; but his design was not unknown to Antipater,\r\nwhich when he perceived, he retired beyond Jordan, and got together an\r\narmy, partly of Arabs, and partly of his own countrymen. However,\r\nMalichus, being one of great cunning, denied that he had laid any snares\r\nfor him, and made his defense with an oath, both to himself and his\r\nsons; and said that while Phasaelus had a garrison in Jerusalem, and\r\nHerod had the weapons of war in his custody, he could never have a\r\nthought of any such thing. So Antipater, perceiving the distress that\r\nMalichus was in, was reconciled to him, and made an agreement with him:\r\nthis was when Marcus was president of Syria; who yet perceiving that\r\nthis Malichus was making a disturbance in Judea, proceeded so far that\r\nhe had almost killed him; but still, at the intercession of Antipater,\r\nhe saved him.\r\n\r\n4. However, Antipater little thought that by saving Malichus he had\r\nsaved his own murderer; for now Cassius and Marcus had got together an\r\narmy, and intrusted the entire care of it with Herod, and made him\r\ngeneral of the forces of Celesyria, and gave him a fleet of ships, and\r\nan army of horsemen and footmen; and promised him, that after the war\r\nwas over they would make him king of Judea; for a war was already begun\r\nbetween Antony and the younger Cæsar: but as Malichus was most afraid of\r\nAntipater, he took him out of the way; and by the offer of money,\r\npersuaded the butler of Hyrcanus, with whom they were both to feast, to\r\nkill him by poison. This being done, and he having armed men with him,\r\nsettled the affairs of the city. But when Antipater's sons, Herod and\r\nPhasaelus, were acquainted with this conspiracy against their father,\r\nand had indignation at it, Malichus denied all, and utterly renounced\r\nany knowledge of the murder. And thus died Antipater, a man that had\r\ndistinguished himself for piety and justice, and love to his country.\r\nAnd whereas one of his sons, Herod, resolved immediately to revenge\r\ntheir father's death, and was coming upon Malichus with an army for that\r\npurpose, the elder of his sons, Phasaelus, thought it best rather to get\r\nthis man into their hands by policy, lest they should appear to begin a\r\ncivil war in the country; so he accepted of Malichus's defense for\r\nhimself, and pretended to believe him that he had had no hand in the\r\nviolent death of Antipater his father, but erected a fine monument for\r\nhim. Herod also went to Samaria; and when he found them in great\r\ndistress, he revived their spirits, and composed their differences.\r\n\r\n5. However, a little after this, Herod, upon the approach of a festival,\r\ncame with his soldiers into the city; whereupon Malichus was affrighted,\r\nand persuaded Hyrcanus not to permit him to come into the city. Hyrcanus\r\ncomplied; and, for a pretense of excluding him, alleged, that a rout of\r\nstrangers ought not to be admitted when the multitude were purifying\r\nthemselves. But Herod had little regard to the messengers that were sent\r\nto him, and entered the city in the night time, and affrighted Malichus;\r\nyet did he remit nothing of his former dissimulation, but wept for\r\nAntipater, and bewailed him as a friend of his with a loud voice; but\r\nHerod and his friends though, it proper not openly to contradict\r\nMalichus's hypocrisy, but to give him tokens of mutual friendship, in\r\norder to prevent his suspicion of them.\r\n\r\n6. However, Herod sent to Cassius, and informed him of the murder of his\r\nfather; who knowing what sort of man Malichus was as to his morals, sent\r\nhim back word that he should revenge his father's death; and also sent\r\nprivately to the commanders of his army at Tyre, with orders to assist\r\nHerod in the execution of a very just design of his. Now when Cassius\r\nhad taken Laodicea, they all went together to him, and carried him\r\ngarlands and money; and Herod thought that Malichus might be punished\r\nwhile he was there; but he was somewhat apprehensive of the thing, and\r\ndesigned to make some great attempt, and because his son was then a\r\nhostage at Tyre, he went to that city, and resolved to steal him away\r\nprivately, and to march thence into Judea; and as Cassius was in haste\r\nto march against Antony, he thought to bring the country to revolt, and\r\nto procure the government for himself. But Providence opposed his\r\ncounsels; and Herod being a shrewd man, and perceiving what his\r\nintention was, he sent thither beforehand a servant, in appearance\r\nindeed to get a supper ready, for he had said before that he would feast\r\nthem all there, but in reality to the commanders of the army, whom he\r\npersuaded to go out against Malichus, with their daggers. So they went\r\nout and met the man near the city, upon the sea-shore, and there stabbed\r\nhim. Whereupon Hyrcanus was so astonished at what had happened, that his\r\nspeech failed him; and when, after some difficulty, he had recovered\r\nhimself, he asked Herod what the matter could be, and who it was that\r\nslew Malichus; and when he said that it was done by the command of\r\nCassius, he commended the action; for that Malichus was a very wicked\r\nman, and one that conspired against his own country. And this was the\r\npunishment that was inflicted on Malichus for what he wickedly did to\r\nAntipater.\r\n\r\n7. But when Cassius was marched out of Syria, disturbances arose in\r\nJudea; for Felix, who was left at Jerusalem with an army, made a sudden\r\nattempt against Phasaelus, and the people themselves rose in arms; but\r\nHerod went to Fabius, the prefect of Damascus, and was desirous to run\r\nto his brother's assistance, but was hindered by a distemper that seized\r\nupon him, till Phasaelus by himself had been too hard for Felix, and had\r\nshut him up in the tower, and there, on certain conditions, dismissed\r\nhim. Phasaelus also complained of Hyrcanus, that although he had\r\nreceived a great many benefits from them, yet did he support their\r\nenemies; for Malichus's brother had made many places to revolt, and kept\r\ngarrisons in them, and particularly Masada, the strongest fortress of\r\nthem all. In the mean time, Herod was recovered of his disease, and came\r\nand took from Felix all the places he had gotten; and, upon certain\r\nconditions, dismissed him also.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. Herod Ejects Antigonus, The Son Of Aristobulus Out Of Judea,\r\nAnd Gains The Friendship Of Antony, Who Was Now Come Into Syria, By\r\nSending Him Much Money; On Which Account He Would Not Admit Of Those\r\nThat Would Have Accused Herod: And What It Was That Antony Wrote To The\r\nTyrians In Behalf.\r\n\r\n1. Now 22 Ptolemy, the son of Menneus, brought back into Judea\r\nAntigonus, the son of Aristobulus, who had already raised an army, and\r\nhad, by money, made Fabius to be his friend, add this because he was of\r\nkin to him. Marion also gave him assistance. He had been left by Cassius\r\nto tyrannize over Tyre; for this Cassius was a man that seized on Syria,\r\nand then kept it under, in the way of a tyrant. Marion also marched into\r\nGalilee, which lay in his neighborhood, and took three of his\r\nfortresses, and put garrisons into them to keep them. But when Herod\r\ncame, he took all from him; but the Tyrian garrison he dismissed in a\r\nvery civil manner; nay, to some of the soldiers he made presents out of\r\nthe good-will he bare to that city. When he had despatched these\r\naffairs, and was gone to meet Antigonus, he joined battle with him, and\r\nbeat him, and drove him out of Judea presently, when he was just come\r\ninto its borders. But when he was come to Jerusalem, Hyrcanus and the\r\npeople put garlands about his head; for he had already contracted an\r\naffinity with the family of Hyrcanus by having espoused a descendant of\r\nhis, and for that reason Herod took the greater care of him, as being to\r\nmarry the daughter of Alexander, the son of Aristobulus, add the\r\ngranddaughter of Hyrcanus, by which wife he became the father of three\r\nmale and two female children. He had also married before this another\r\nwife, out of a lower family of his own nation, whose name was Doris, by\r\nwhom he had his eldest son Antipater.\r\n\r\n2. Now Antonius and Cæsar had beaten Cassius near Philippi, as others\r\nhave related; but after the victory, Cæsar went into Gaul, [Italy,] and\r\nAntony marched for Asia, who, when he was arrived at Bithynia, he had\r\nambassadors that met him from all parts. The principal men also of the\r\nJews came thither, to accuse Phasaelus and Herod; and they said that\r\nHyrcanus had indeed the appearance of reigning, but that these men had\r\nall the power: but Antony paid great respect to Herod, who was come to\r\nhim to make his defense against his accusers, on which account his\r\nadversaries could not so much as obtain a hearing; which favor Herod had\r\ngained of Antony by money. But still, when Antony was come to Ephesus,\r\nHyrcanus the high priest, and our nation, sent an embassage to him,\r\nwhich carried a crown of gold with them, and desired that he would write\r\nto the governors of the provinces, to set those Jews free who had been\r\ncarried captive by Cassius, and this without their having fought against\r\nhim, and to restore them that country, which, in the days of Cassius,\r\nhad been taken from them. Antony thought the Jews' desires were just,\r\nand wrote immediately to Hyrcanus, and to the Jews. He also sent, at the\r\nsame time, a decree to the Tyrians; the contents of which were to the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\n3. \"Marcus Antonius, imperator, to Hyrcanus the high priest and ethnarch\r\nof the Jews, sendeth greeting. It you be in health, it is well; I am\r\nalso in health, with the army. Lysimachus, the son of Pausanias, and\r\nJosephus, the son of Menneus, and Alexander, the son of Theodorus, your\r\nambassadors, met me at Ephesus, and have renewed the embassage which\r\nthey had formerly been upon at Rome, and have diligently acquitted\r\nthemselves of the present embassage, which thou and thy nation have\r\nintrusted to them, and have fully declared the goodwill thou hast for\r\nus. I am therefore satisfied, both by your actions and your words, that\r\nyou are well-disposed to us; and I understand that your conduct of life\r\nis constant and religious: so I reckon upon you as our own. But when\r\nthose that were adversaries to you, and to the Roman people, abstained\r\nneither from cities nor temples, and did not observe the agreement they\r\nhad confirmed by oath, it was not only on account of our contest with\r\nthem, but on account of all mankind in common, that we have taken\r\nvengeance on those who have been the authors of great injustice towards\r\nmen, and of great wickedness towards the gods; for the sake of which we\r\nsuppose it was that the sun turned away his light from us, 23 as\r\nunwilling to view the horrid crime they were guilty of in the case of\r\nCæsar. We have also overcome their conspiracies, which threatened the\r\ngods themselves, which Macedonia received, as it is a climate peculiarly\r\nproper for impious and insolent attempts; and we have overcome that\r\nconfused rout of men, half mad with spite against us, which they got\r\ntogether at Philippi in Macedonia, when they seized on the places that\r\nwere proper for their purpose, and, as it were, walled them round with\r\nmountains to the very sea, and where the passage was open only through a\r\nsingle gate. This victory we gained, because the gods had condemned\r\nthose men for their wicked enterprises. Now Brutus, when he had fled as\r\nfar as Philippi, was shut up by us, and became a partaker of the same\r\nperdition with Cassius; and now these have received their punishment, we\r\nsuppose that we may enjoy peace for the time to come, and that Asia may\r\nbe at rest from war. We therefore make that peace which God hath given\r\nus common to our confederates also, insomuch that the body of Asia is\r\nnow recovered out of that distemper it was under by the means of our\r\nvictory. I, therefore, bearing in mind both thee and your nation, shall\r\ntake care of what may be for your advantage. I have also sent epistles\r\nin writing to the several cities, that if any persons, whether free-men\r\nor bond-men, have been sold under the spear by Caius Cassius, or his\r\nsubordinate officers, they may be set free. And I will that you kindly\r\nmake use of the favors which I and Dolabella have granted you. I also\r\nforbid the Tyrians to use any violence with you; and for what places of\r\nthe Jews they now possess, I order them to restore them. I have withal\r\naccepted of the crown which thou sentest me.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"Marcus Antonius, imperator, to the magistrates, senate, and people\r\nof Tyre, sendeth greeting. The ambassadors of Hyrcanus, the high priest\r\nand ethnarch [of the Jews], appeared before me at Ephesus, and told me\r\nthat you are in possession of part of their country, which you entered\r\nupon under the government of our adversaries. Since, therefore, we have\r\nundertaken a war for the obtaining the government, and have taken care\r\nto do what was agreeable to piety and justice, and have brought to\r\npunishment those that had neither any remembrance of the kindnesses they\r\nhad received, nor have kept their oaths, I will that you be at peace\r\nwith those that are our confederates; as also, that what you have taken\r\nby the means of our adversaries shall not be reckoned your own, but be\r\nreturned to those from whom you took them; for none of them took their\r\nprovinces or their armies by the gift of the senate, but they seized\r\nthem by force, and bestowed them by violence upon such as became useful\r\nto them in their unjust proceedings. Since, therefore, those men have\r\nreceived the punishment due to them, we desire that our confederates may\r\nretain whatsoever it was that they formerly possessed without\r\ndisturbance, and that you restore all the places which belong to\r\nHyrcanus, the ethnarch of the Jews, which you have had, though it were\r\nbut one day before Caius Cassius began an unjustifiable war against us,\r\nand entered into our province; nor do you use any force against him, in\r\norder to weaken him, that he may not be able to dispose of that which is\r\nhis own; but if you have any contest with him about your respective\r\nrights, it shall be lawful for you to plead your cause when we come upon\r\nthe places concerned, for we shall alike preserve the rights and hear\r\nall the causes of our confederates.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"Marcus Antonius, imperator, to the magistrates, senate, and people\r\nof Tyre, sendeth greeting. I have sent you my decree, of which I will\r\nthat ye take care that it be engraven on the public tables, in Roman and\r\nGreek letters, and that it stand engraven in the most illustrious\r\nplaces, that it may be read by all. Marcus Antonius, imperator, one of\r\nthe triumvirate over the public affairs, made this declaration: Since\r\nCaius Cassius, in this revolt he hath made, hath pillaged that province\r\nwhich belonged not to him, and was held by garrisons there encamped,\r\nwhile they were our confederates, and hath spoiled that nation of the\r\nJews that was in friendship with the Roman people, as in war; and since\r\nwe have overcome his madness by arms, we now correct by our decrees and\r\njudicial determinations what he hath laid waste, that those things may\r\nbe restored to our confederates. And as for what hath been sold of the\r\nJewish possessions, whether they be bodies or possessions, let them be\r\nreleased; the bodies into that state of freedom they were originally in,\r\nand the possessions to their former owners. I also will that he who\r\nshall not comply with this decree of mine shall be punished for his\r\ndisobedience; and if such a one be caught, I will take care that the\r\noffenders suffer condign punishment.\"\r\n\r\n6. The same thing did Antony write to the Sidonians, and the\r\nAntiochians, and the Aradians. We have produced these decrees,\r\ntherefore, as marks for futurity of the truth of what we have said, that\r\nthe Romans had a great concern about our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. How Antony Made Herod And Phasaelus Tetrarchs, After They\r\nHad Been Accused To No Purpose; And How The Parthians When They Brought\r\nAntigonus Into Judea Took Hyrcanus And Phasaelus Captives. Herod's\r\nFlight; And What Afflictions Hyrcanus And Phasaelus Endured.\r\n\r\n1. When after this Antony came into Syria, Cleopatra met him in Cilicia,\r\nand brought him to fall in love with her. And there came now also a\r\nhundred of the most potent of the Jews to accuse Herod and those about\r\nhim, and set the men of the greatest eloquence among them to speak. But\r\nMessala contradicted them, on behalf of the young men, and all this in\r\nthe presence of Hyrcanus, who was Herod's father-in-law 24 already. When\r\nAntony had heard both sides at Daphne, he asked Hyrcanus who they were\r\nthat governed the nation best. He replied, Herod and his friends.\r\nHereupon Antony, by reason of the old hospitable friendship he had made\r\nwith his father [Antipater], at that time when he was with Gabinius, he\r\nmade both Herod and Phasaelus tetrarchs, and committed the public\r\naffairs of the Jews to them, and wrote letters to that purpose. He also\r\nbound fifteen of their adversaries, and was going to kill them, but that\r\nHerod obtained their pardon.\r\n\r\n2. Yet did not these men continue quiet when they were come back, but a\r\nthousand of the Jews came to Tyre to meet him there, whither the report\r\nwas that he would come. But Antony was corrupted by the money which\r\nHerod and his brother had given him; and so he gave order to the\r\ngovernor of the place to punish the Jewish ambassadors, who were for\r\nmaking innovations, and to settle the government upon Herod; but Herod\r\nwent out hastily to them, and Hyrcanus was with him, [for they stood\r\nupon the shore before the city,] and he charged them to go their ways,\r\nbecause great mischief would befall them if they went on with their\r\naccusation. But they did not acquiesce; whereupon the Romans ran upon\r\nthem with their daggers, and slew some, and wounded more of them, and\r\nthe rest fled away and went home, and lay still in great consternation.\r\nAnd when the people made a clamor against Herod, Antony was so provoked\r\nat it, that he slew the prisoners.\r\n\r\n3. Now, in the second year, Pacorus, the king of Parthia's son, and\r\nBarzapharnes, a commander of the Parthians, possessed themselves of\r\nSyria. Ptolemy, the son of Menneus, also was now dead, and Lysanias his\r\nson took his government, and made a league of friendship with Antigonus,\r\nthe son of Aristobulus; and in order to obtain it, made use of that\r\ncommander, who had great interest in him. Now Antigonus had promised to\r\ngive the Parthians a thousand talents, and five hundred women, upon\r\ncondition they would take the government away from Hyrcanus, and bestow\r\nit upon him, and withal kill Herod. And although he did not give them\r\nwhat he had promised, yet did the Parthians make an expedition into\r\nJudea on that account, and carried Antigonus with them. Pacorus went\r\nalong the maritime parts, but the commander Barzapharnes through the\r\nmidland. Now the Tyrians excluded Pacorus, but the Sidonians and those\r\nof Ptolemais received him. However, Pacorus sent a troop of horsemen\r\ninto Judea, to take a view of the state of the country, and to assist\r\nAntigonus; and sent also the king's butler, of the same name with\r\nhimself. So when the Jews that dwelt about Mount Carmel came to\r\nAntigonus, and were ready to march with him into Judea, Antigonus hoped\r\nto get some part of the country by their assistance. The place is called\r\nDrymi; and when some others came and met them, the men privately fell\r\nupon Jerusalem; and when some more were come to them, they got together\r\nin great numbers, and came against the king's palace, and besieged it.\r\nBut as Phasaelus's and Herod's party came to the other's assistance, and\r\na battle happened between them in the market-place, the young men beat\r\ntheir enemies, and pursued them into the temple, and sent some armed men\r\ninto the adjoining houses to keep them in, who yet being destitute of\r\nsuch as should support them, were burnt, and the houses with them, by\r\nthe people who rose up against them. But Herod was revenged on these\r\nseditious adversaries of his a little afterward for this injury they had\r\noffered him, when he fought with them, and slew a great number of them.\r\n\r\n4. But while there were daily skirmishes, the enemy waited for the\r\ncoming of the multitude out of the country to Pentecost, a feast of ours\r\nso called; and when that day was come, many ten thousands of the people\r\nwere gathered together about the temple, some in armor, and some\r\nwithout. Now those that came guarded both the temple and the city,\r\nexcepting what belonged to the palace, which Herod guarded with a few of\r\nhis soldiers; and Phasaelus had the charge of the wall, while Herod,\r\nwith a body of his men, sallied out upon the enemy, who lay in the\r\nsuburbs, and fought courageously, and put many ten thousands to flight,\r\nsome flying into the city, and some into the temple, and some into the\r\nouter fortifications, for some such fortifications there were in that\r\nplace. Phasaelus came also to his assistance; yet was Pacorus, the\r\ngeneral of the Parthians, at the desire of Antigonus, admitted into the\r\ncity, with a few of his horsemen, under pretence indeed as if he would\r\nstill the sedition, but in reality to assist Antigonus in obtaining the\r\ngovernment. And when Phasaelus met him, and received him kindly, Pacorus\r\npersuaded him to go himself as ambassador to Barzapharnes, which was\r\ndone fraudulently. Accordingly, Phasaelus, suspecting no harm, complied\r\nwith his proposal, while Herod did not give his consent to what was\r\ndone, because of the perfidiousness of these barbarians, but desired\r\nPhasaelus rather to fight those that were come into the city.\r\n\r\n5. So both Hyrcanus and Phasaelus went on the embassage; but Pacorus\r\nleft with Herod two hundred horsemen, and ten men, who were called the\r\nfreemen, and conducted the others on their journey; and when they were\r\nin Galilee, the governors of the cities there met them in their arms.\r\nBarzapharnes also received them at the first with cheerfulness, and made\r\nthem presents, though he afterward conspired against them; and\r\nPhasaelus, with his horsemen, were conducted to the sea-side. But when\r\nthey heard that Antigonus had promised to give the Parthians a thousand\r\ntalents, and five hundred women, to assist him against them, they soon\r\nhad a suspicion of the barbarians. Moreover, there was one who informed\r\nthem that snares were laid for them by night, while a guard came about\r\nthem secretly; and they had then been seized upon, had not they waited\r\nfor the seizure of Herod by the Parthians that were about Jerusalem,\r\nlest, upon the slaughter of Hyrcanus and Phasaelus, he should have an\r\nintimation of it, and escape out of their hands. And these were the\r\ncircumstances they were now in; and they saw who they were that guarded\r\nthem. Some persons indeed would have persuaded Phasaelus to fly away\r\nimmediately on horseback, and not stay any longer; and there was one\r\nOphellius, who, above all the rest, was earnest with him to do so; for\r\nhe had heard of this treachery from Saramalla, the richest of all the\r\nSyrians at that time, who also promised to provide him ships to carry\r\nhim off; for the sea was just by them. But he had no mind to desert\r\nHyrcanus, nor bring his brother into danger; but he went to\r\nBarzapharnes, and told him he did not act justly when he made such a\r\ncontrivance against them; for that if he wanted money, he would give him\r\nmore than Antigonus; and besides, that it was a horrible thing to slay\r\nthose that came to him upon the security of their oaths, and that when\r\nthey had done them no injury. But the barbarian swore to him that there\r\nwas no truth in any of his suspicions, but that he was troubled with\r\nnothing but false proposals, and then went away to Pacorus.\r\n\r\n6. But as soon as he was gone away, some men came and bound Hyrcanus and\r\nPhasaelus, while Phasaelus greatly reproached the Parthians for their\r\nperjury; However, that butler who was sent against Herod had it in\r\ncommand to get him without the walls of the city, and seize upon him;\r\nbut messengers had been sent by Phasaelus to inform Herod of the\r\nperfidiousness of the Parthians. And when he knew that the enemy had\r\nseized upon them, he went to Pacorus, and to the most potent of the\r\nParthians, as to the lord of the rest, who, although they knew the whole\r\nmatter, dissembled with him in a deceitful way; and said that he ought\r\nto go out with them before the walls, and meet those which were bringing\r\nhim his letters, for that they were not taken by his adversaries, but\r\nwere coming to give him an account of the good success Phasaelus had\r\nhad. Herod did not give credit to what they said; for he had heard that\r\nhis brother was seized upon by others also; and the daughter of\r\nHyrcanus, whose daughter he had espoused, was his monitor also [not to\r\ncredit them], which made him still more suspicious of the Parthians; for\r\nalthough other people did not give heed to her, yet did he believe her\r\nas a woman of very great wisdom.\r\n\r\n7. Now while the Parthians were in consultation what was fit to be done;\r\nfor they did not think it proper to make an open attempt upon a person\r\nof his character; and while they put off the determination to the next\r\nday, Herod was under great disturbance of mind, and rather inclining to\r\nbelieve the reports he heard about his brother and the Parthians, than\r\nto give heed to what was said on the other side, he determined, that\r\nwhen the evening came on, he would make use of it for his flight, and\r\nnot make any longer delay, as if the dangers from the enemy were not yet\r\ncertain. He therefore removed with the armed men whom he had with him;\r\nand set his wives upon the beasts, as also his mother, and sister, and\r\nher whom he was about to marry, [Mariamne,] the daughter of Alexander,\r\nthe son of Aristobulus, with her mother, the daughter of Hyrcanus, and\r\nhis youngest brother, and all their servants, and the rest of the\r\nmultitude that was with him, and without the enemy's privity pursued his\r\nway to Idumea. Nor could any enemy of his who then saw him in this case\r\nbe so hardhearted, but would have commiserated his fortune, while the\r\nwomen drew along their infant children and left their own country, and\r\ntheir friends in prison, with tears in their eyes, and sad lamentations,\r\nand in expectation of nothing but what was of a melancholy nature.\r\n\r\n8. But for Herod himself, he raised his mind above the miserable state\r\nhe was in, and was of good courage in the midst of his misfortunes; and\r\nas he passed along, he bid them every one to be of good cheer, and not\r\nto give themselves up to sorrow, because that would hinder them in their\r\nflight, which was now the only hope of safety that they had.\r\nAccordingly, they tried to bear with patience the calamity they were\r\nunder, as he exhorted them to do; yet was he once almost going to kill\r\nhimself, upon the overthrow of a waggon, and the danger his mother was\r\nthen in of being killed; and this on two accounts, because of his great\r\nconcern for her, and because he was afraid lest, by this delay, the\r\nenemy should overtake him in the pursuit: but as he was drawing his\r\nsword, and going to kill himself therewith, those that were present\r\nrestrained him, and being so many in number, were too hard for him; and\r\ntold him that he ought not to desert them, and leave them a prey to\r\ntheir enemies, for that it was not the part of a brave man to free\r\nhimself from the distresses he was in, and to overlook his friends that\r\nwere in the same distresses also. So he was compelled to let that horrid\r\nattempt alone, partly out of shame at what they said to him, and partly\r\nout of regard to the great number of those that would not permit him to\r\ndo what he intended. So he encouraged his mother, and took all the care\r\nof her the time would allow, and proceeded on the way he proposed to go\r\nwith the utmost haste, and that was to the fortress of Masada. And as he\r\nhad many skirmishes with such of the Parthians as attacked him and\r\npursued him, he was conqueror in them all.\r\n\r\n9. Nor indeed was he free from the Jews all along as he was in his\r\nflight; for by that time he was gotten sixty furlongs out of the city,\r\nand was upon the road, they fell upon him, and fought hand to hand with\r\nhim, whom he also put to flight, and overcame, not like one that was in\r\ndistress and in necessity, but like one that was excellently prepared\r\nfor war, and had what he wanted in great plenty. And in this very place\r\nwhere he overcame the Jews it was that he some time afterward build a\r\nmost excellent palace, and a city round about it, and called it\r\nHerodium. And when he was come to Idumea, at a place called Thressa, his\r\nbrother Joseph met him, and he then held a council to take advice about\r\nall his affairs, and what was fit to be done in his circumstances, since\r\nhe had a great multitude that followed him, besides his mercenary\r\nsoldiers, and the place Masada, whither he proposed to fly, was too\r\nsmall to contain so great a multitude; so he sent away the greater part\r\nof his company, being above nine thousand, and bid them go, some one\r\nway, and some another, and so save themselves in Idumea, and gave them\r\nwhat would buy them provisions in their journey. But he took with him\r\nthose that were the least encumbered, and were most intimate with him,\r\nand came to the fortress, and placed there his wives and his followers,\r\nbeing eight hundred in number, there being in the place a sufficient\r\nquantity of corn and water, and other necessaries, and went directly for\r\nPetra, in Arabia. But when it was day, the Parthians plundered all\r\nJerusalem, and the palace, and abstained from nothing but Hyrcanus's\r\nmoney, which was three hundred talents. A great deal of Herod's money\r\nescaped, and principally all that the man had been so provident as to\r\nsend into Idumea beforehand; nor indeed did what was in the city suffice\r\nthe Parthians, but they went out into the country, and plundered it, and\r\ndemolished the city Marissa.\r\n\r\n10. And thus was Antigonus brought back into Judea by the king of the\r\nParthians, and received Hyrcanus and Phasaelus for his prisoners; but he\r\nwas greatly cast down because the women had escaped, whom he intended to\r\nhave given the enemy, as having promised they should have them, with the\r\nmoney, for their reward: but being afraid that Hyrcanus, who was under\r\nthe guard of the Parthians, might have his kingdom restored to him by\r\nthe multitude, he cut off his ears, and thereby took care that the high\r\npriesthood should never come to him any more, because he was maimed,\r\nwhile the law required that this dignity should belong to none but such\r\nas had all their members entire 25 But now one cannot but here admire\r\nthe fortitude of Phasaelus, who, perceiving that he was to be put to\r\ndeath, did not think death any terrible thing at all; but to die thus by\r\nthe means of his enemy, this he thought a most pitiable and dishonorable\r\nthing; and therefore, since he had not his hands at liberty, but the\r\nbonds he was in prevented him from killing himself thereby, he dashed\r\nhis head against a great stone, and thereby took away his own life,\r\nwhich he thought to be the best thing he could do in such a distress as\r\nhe was in, and thereby put it out of the power of the enemy to bring him\r\nto any death he pleased. It is also reported, that when he had made a\r\ngreat wound in his head, Antigonus sent physicians to cure it, and, by\r\nordering them to infuse poison into the wound, killed him. However,\r\nPhasaelus hearing, before he was quite dead, by a certain woman, that\r\nhis brother Herod had escaped the enemy, underwent his death cheerfully,\r\nsince he now left behind him one who would revenge his death, and who\r\nwas able to inflict punishment on his enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. How Herod Got Away From The King Of Arabia And Made Haste To\r\nGo Into Egypt And Thence Went Away In Haste Also To Rome; And How, By\r\nPromising A Great Deal Of Money To Antony He Obtained Of The Senate And\r\nOf Cæsar To Be Made King Of The Jews.\r\n\r\n1. As for Herod, the great miseries he was in did not discourage him,\r\nbut made him sharp in discovering surprising undertakings; for he went\r\nto Malchus, king of Arabia, whom he had formerly been very kind to, in\r\norder to receive somewhat by way of requital, now he was in more than\r\nordinary want of it, and desired he would let him have some money,\r\neither by way of loan, or as his free gift, on account of the many\r\nbenefits he had received from him; for not knowing what was become of\r\nhis brother, he was in haste to redeem him out of the hand of his\r\nenemies, as willing to give three hundred talents for the price of his\r\nredemption. He also took with him the son of Phasaelus, who was a child\r\nof but seven years of age, for this very reason, that he might be a\r\nhostage for the repayment of the money. But there came messengers from\r\nMalchus to meet him, by whom he was desired to be gone, for that the\r\nParthians had laid a charge upon him not to entertain Herod. This was\r\nonly a pretense which he made use of, that he might not be obliged to\r\nrepay him what he owed him; and this he was further induced to by the\r\nprincipal men among the Arabians, that they might cheat him of what sums\r\nthey had received from [his father] Antipater, and which he had\r\ncommitted to their fidelity. He made answer, that he did not intend to\r\nbe troublesome to them by his coning thither, but that he desired only\r\nto discourse with them about certain affairs that were to him of the\r\ngreatest importance.\r\n\r\n2. Hereupon he resolved to go away, and did go very prudently the road\r\nto Egypt; and then it was that he lodged in a certain temple; for he had\r\nleft a great many of his followers there. On the next day he came to\r\nRhinocolura, and there it was that he heard what was befallen his\r\nbrother. Though Malehus soon repented of what he had done, and came\r\nrunning after Herod; but with no manner of success, for he was gotten a\r\nvery great way off, and made haste into the road to Pelusium; and when\r\nthe stationary ships that lay there hindered him from sailing to\r\nAlexandria, he went to their captains, by whose assistance, and that out\r\nof much reverence of and great regard to him, he was conducted into the\r\ncity [Alexandria], and was retained there by Cleopatra; yet was she not\r\nable to prevail with him to stay there, because he was making haste to\r\nRome, even though the weather was stormy, and he was informed that the\r\naffairs of Italy were very tumultuous, and in great disorder.\r\n\r\n3. So he set sail from thence to Pamphylia, and falling into a violent\r\nstorm, he had much ado to escape to Rhodes, with the loss of the ship's\r\nburden; and there it was that two of his friends, Sappinas and\r\nPtolemeus, met with him; and as he found that city very much damaged in\r\nthe war against Cassius, though he were in necessity himself, he\r\nneglected not to do it a kindness, but did what he could to recover it\r\nto its former state. He also built there a three-decked ship, and set\r\nsail thence, with his friends, for Italy, and came to the port of\r\nBrundusium; and when he was come from thence to Rome, he first related\r\nto Antony what had befallen him in Judea, and how Phasaelus his brother\r\nwas seized on by the Parthians, and put to death by them, and how\r\nHyrcanus was detained captive by them, and how they had made Antigonus\r\nking, who had promised them a sum of money, no less than a thousand\r\ntalents, with five hundred women, who were to be of the principal\r\nfamilies, and of the Jewish stock; and that he had carried off the women\r\nby night; and that, by undergoing a great many hardships, he had escaped\r\nthe hands of his enemies; as also, that his own relations were in danger\r\nof being besieged and taken, and that he had sailed through a storm, and\r\ncontemned all these terrible dangers of it, in order to come, as soon as\r\npossible, to him, who was his hope and only succor at this time.\r\n\r\n4. This account made Antony commiserate the change that had happened in\r\nHerod's condition; 26 and reasoning with himself that this was a common\r\ncase among those that are placed in such great dignities, and that they\r\nare liable to the mutations that come from fortune, he was very ready to\r\ngive him the assistance he desired, and this because he called to mind\r\nthe friendship he had had with Antipater because Herod offered him money\r\nto make him king, as he had formerly given it him to make him tetrarch,\r\nand chiefly because of his hatred to Antigonus; for he took him to be a\r\nseditious person, and an enemy to the Romans. Cæsar was also the\r\nforwarder to raise Herod's dignity, and to give him his assistance in\r\nwhat he desired, on account of the toils of war which he had himself\r\nundergone with Antipater his father in Egypt, and of the hospitality he\r\nhad treated him withal, and the kindness he had always showed him, as\r\nalso to gratify Antony, who was very zealous for Herod. So a senate was\r\nconvocated; and Messala first, and then Atratinus, introduced Herod into\r\nit, and enlarged upon the benefits they had received from his father,\r\nand put them in mind of the good-will he had borne to the Romans. At the\r\nsame time, they accused Antigonus, and declared him an enemy, not only\r\nbecause of his former opposition to them, but that he had now overlooked\r\nthe Romans, and taken the government from the Parthians. Upon this the\r\nsenate was irritated; and Antony informed them further, that it was for\r\ntheir advantage in the Parthian war that Herod should be king. This\r\nseemed good to all the senators; and so they made a decree accordingly.\r\n\r\n5. And this was the principal instance of Antony's affection for Herod,\r\nthat he not only procured him a kingdom which he did not expect, [for he\r\ndid not come with an intention to ask the kingdom for himself, which he\r\ndid not suppose the Romans would grant him, who used to bestow it on\r\nsome of the royal family, but intended to desire it for his wife's\r\nbrother, who was grandson by his father to Aristobulus, and to Hyrcanus\r\nby his mother,] but that he procured it for him so suddenly, that he\r\nobtained what he did not expect, and departed out of Italy in so few\r\ndays as seven in all. This young man [the grandson] Herod afterward took\r\ncare to have slain, as we shall show in its proper place. But when the\r\nsenate was dissolved, Antony and Cæsar went out of the senate house with\r\nHerod between them, and with the consuls and other magistrates before\r\nthem, in order to offer sacrifices, and to lay up their decrees in the\r\ncapitol. Antony also feasted Herod the first day of his reign. And thus\r\ndid this man receive the kingdom, having obtained it on the hundred and\r\neighty-fourth olympiad, when Caius Domitius Calvinus was consul the\r\nsecond time, and Caius Asinius Pollio [the first time].\r\n\r\n6. All this while Antigonus besieged those that were in Masada, who had\r\nplenty of all other necessaries, but were only in want of water 27\r\ninsomuch that on this occasion Joseph, Herod's brother, was contriving\r\nto run away from it, with two hundred of his dependents, to the\r\nArabians; for he had heard that Malchus repented of the offenses he had\r\nbeen guilty of with regard to Herod; but God, by sending rain in the\r\nnight time, prevented his going away, for their cisterns were thereby\r\nfilled, and he was under no necessity of running away on that account;\r\nbut they were now of good courage, and the more so, because the sending\r\nthat plenty of water which they had been in want of seemed a mark of\r\nDivine Providence; so they made a sally, and fought hand to hand with\r\nAntigonus's soldiers, [with some openly, with some privately,] and\r\ndestroyed a great number of them. At the same time Ventidius, the\r\ngeneral of the Romans, was sent out of Syria, to drive the Parthians out\r\nof it, and marched after them into Judea, in pretense indeed to succor\r\nJoseph; but in reality the whole affair was no more than a stratagem, in\r\norder to get money of Antigonus; so they pitched their camp very near to\r\nJerusalem, and stripped Antigonus of a great deal of money, and then he\r\nretired himself with the greater part of the army; but, that the\r\nwickedness he had been guilty of might be found out, he left Silo there,\r\nwith a certain part of his soldiers, with whom also Antigonus cultivated\r\nan acquaintance, that he might cause him no disturbance, and was still\r\nin hopes that the Parthians would come again and defend him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15. How Herod Sailed Out Of Italy To Judea, And Fought With\r\nAntigonus And What Other Things Happened In Judea About That Time.\r\n\r\n1. By this time Herod had sailed out of Italy to Ptolemais, and had\r\ngotten together no small army, both of strangers and of his own\r\ncountrymen, and marched through Galilee against Antignus. Silo also, and\r\nVentidius, came and assisted him, being persuaded by Dellius, who was\r\nsent by Antony to assist in bringing back Herod. Now for Ventidius, he\r\nwas employed in composing the disturbances that had been made in the\r\ncities by the means of the Parthians; and for Silo, he was in Judea\r\nindeed, but corrupted by Antigonus. However, as Herod went along his\r\narmy increased every day, and all Galilee, with some small exception,\r\njoined him; but as he was to those that were in Masada, [for he was\r\nobliged to endeavor to save those that were in that fortress now they\r\nwere besieged, because they were his relations,] Joppa was a hinderance\r\nto him, for it was necessary for him to take that place first, it being\r\na city at variance with him, that no strong hold might be left in his\r\nenemies' hands behind him when he should go to Jerusalem. And when Silo\r\nmade this a pretense for rising up from Jerusalem, and was thereupon\r\npursued by the Jews, Herod fell upon them with a small body of men, and\r\nboth put the Jews to flight and saved Silo, when he was very poorly able\r\nto defend himself; but when Herod had taken Joppa, he made haste to set\r\nfree those of his family that were in Masada. Now of the people of the\r\ncountry, some joined him because of the friendship they had had with his\r\nfather, and some because of the splendid appearance he made, and others\r\nby way of requital for the benefits they had received from both of them;\r\nbut the greatest number came to him in hopes of getting somewhat from\r\nhim afterward, if he were once firmly settled in the kingdom.\r\n\r\n2. Herod had now a strong army; and as he marched on, Antigonus laid\r\nsnares and ambushes in the passes and places most proper for them; but\r\nin truth he thereby did little or no damage to the enemy. So Herod\r\nreceived those of his family out of Masada, and the fortress Ressa, and\r\nthen went on for Jerusalem. The soldiery also that was with Silo\r\naccompanied him all along, as did many of the citizens, being afraid of\r\nhis power; and as soon as he had pitched his camp on the west side of\r\nthe city, the soldiers that were set to guard that part shot their\r\narrows and threw their darts at him; and when some sallied out in a\r\ncrowd, and came to fight hand to hand with the first ranks of Herod's\r\narmy, he gave orders that they should, in the first place, make\r\nproclamation about the wall, that he came for the good of the people,\r\nand for the preservation of the city, and not to bear any old grudge at\r\neven his most open enemies, but ready to forget the offenses which his\r\ngreatest adversaries had done him. But Antigonus, by way of reply to\r\nwhat Herod had caused to be proclaimed, and this before the Romans, and\r\nbefore Silo also, said that they would not do justly, if they gave the\r\nkingdom to Herod, who was no more than a private man, and an Idumean,\r\ni.e. a half Jew, 28 whereas they ought to bestow it on one of the royal\r\nfamily, as their custom was; for that in case they at present bear an\r\nill-will to him, and had resolved to deprive him of the kingdom, as\r\nhaving received it from the Parthians, yet were there many others of his\r\nfamily that might by their law take it, and these such as had no way\r\noffended the Romans; and being of the sacerdotal family, it would be an\r\nunworthy thing to put them by. Now while they said thus one to another,\r\nand fell to reproaching one another on both sides, Antigonus permitted\r\nhis own men that were upon the wall to defend themselves, who using\r\ntheir bows, and showing great alacrity against their enemies, easily\r\ndrove them away from the towers.\r\n\r\n3. And now it was that Silo discovered that he had taken bribes; for he\r\nset a good number of his soldiers to complain aloud of the want of\r\nprovisions they were in, and to require money to buy them food; and that\r\nit was fit to let them go into places proper for winter quarters, since\r\nthe places near the city were a desert, by reason that Antigonus's\r\nsoldiers had carried all away; so he set the army upon removing, and\r\nendeavored to march away; but Herod pressed Silo not to depart, and\r\nexhorted Silo's captains and soldiers not to desert him, when Cæsar, and\r\nAntony, and the senate had sent him thither, for that he would provide\r\nthem plenty of all the things they wanted, and easily procure them a\r\ngreat abundance of what they required; after which entreaty, he\r\nimmediately went out into the country, and left not the least pretense\r\nto Silo for his departure; for he brought an unexpected quantity of\r\nprovisions, and sent to those friends of his who inhabited about Samaria\r\nto bring down corn, and wine, and oil, and cattle, and all other\r\nprovisions, to Jericho, that those might be no want of a supply for the\r\nsoldiers for the time to come. Antigonus was sensible of this, and sent\r\npresently over the country such as might restrain and lie in ambush for\r\nthose that went out for provisions. So these men obeyed the orders of\r\nAntigonus, and got together a great number of armed men about Jericho,\r\nand sat upon the mountains, and watched those that brought the\r\nprovisions. However, Herod was not idle in the mean time, for he took\r\nten bands of soldiers, of whom five were of the Romans, and five of the\r\nJews, with some mercenaries among them, and with some few horsemen, and\r\ncame to Jericho; and as they found the city deserted, but that five\r\nhundred of them had settled themselves on the tops of the hills, with\r\ntheir wives and children, those he took and sent away; but the Romans\r\nfell upon the city, and plundered it, and found the houses full of all\r\nsorts of good things. So the king left a garrison at Jericho, and came\r\nback again, and sent the Roman army to take their winter quarters in the\r\ncountries that were come over to him, Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria.\r\nAnd so much did Antigonus gain of Silo for the bribes he gave him, that\r\npart of the army should be quartered at Lydda, in order to please\r\nAntony. So the Romans laid their weapons aside, and lived in plenty of\r\nall things.\r\n\r\n4. But Herod was not pleased with lying still, but sent out his brother\r\nJoseph against Idumea with two thousand armed footmen, and four hundred\r\nhorsemen, while he himself came to Samaria, and left his mother and his\r\nother relations there, for they were already gone out of Masada, and\r\nwent into Galilee, to take certain places which were held by the\r\ngarrisons of Antigonus; and he passed on to Sepphoris, as God sent a\r\nsnow, while Antigonus's garrisons withdrew themselves, and had great\r\nplenty of provisions. He also went thence, and resolved to destroy those\r\nrobbers that dwelt in the caves, and did much mischief in the country;\r\nso he sent a troop of horsemen, and three companies of armed footmen,\r\nagainst them. They were very near to a village called Arbela; and on the\r\nfortieth day after, he came himself with his whole army: and as the\r\nenemy sallied out boldly upon him, the left wing of his army gave way;\r\nbut he appearing with a body of men, put those to flight who were\r\nalready conquerors, and recalled his men that ran away. He also pressed\r\nupon his enemies, and pursued them as far as the river Jordan, though\r\nthey ran away by different roads. So he brought over to him all Galilee,\r\nexcepting those that dwelt in the caves, and distributed money to every\r\none of his soldiers, giving them a hundred and fifty drachmae apiece,\r\nand much more to their captains, and sent them into winter quarters; at\r\nwhich time Silo came to him, and his commanders with him, because\r\nAntigonus would not give them provisions any longer, for he supplied\r\nthem for no more than one month; nay, he had sent to all the country\r\nabout, and ordered them to carry off the provisions that were there, and\r\nretire to the mountains, that the Romans might have no provisions to\r\nlive upon, and so might perish by famine. But Herod committed the care\r\nof that matter to Pheroras, his youngest brother, and ordered him to\r\nrepair Alexandrium also. Accordingly, he quickly made the soldiers\r\nabound with great plenty of provisions, and rebuilt Alexandrium, which\r\nhad been before desolate.\r\n\r\n5. About this time it was that Antony continued some time at Athens, and\r\nthat Ventidius, who was now in Syria, sent for Silo, and commanded him\r\nto assist Herod, in the first place, to finish the present war, and then\r\nto send for their confederates for the war they were themselves engaged\r\nin; but as for Herod, he went in haste against the robbers that were in\r\nthe caves, and sent Silo away to Ventidius, while he marched against\r\nthem. These caves were in mountains that were exceeding abrupt, and in\r\ntheir middle were no other than precipices, with certain entrances into\r\nthe caves, and those caves were encompassed with sharp rocks, and in\r\nthese did the robbers lie concealed, with all their families about them;\r\nbut the king caused certain chests to be made, in order to destroy them,\r\nand to be hung down, bound about with iron chains, by an engine, from\r\nthe top of the mountain, it being not possible to get up to them, by\r\nreason of the sharp ascent of the mountains, nor to creep down to them\r\nfrom above. Now these chests were filled with armed men, who had long\r\nhooks in their hands, by which they might pull out such as resisted\r\nthem, and then tumble them down, and kill them by so doing; but the\r\nletting the chests down proved to be a matter of great danger, because\r\nof the vast depth they were to be let down, although they had their\r\nprovisions in the chests themselves. But when the chests were let down,\r\nand not one of those in the mouths of the caves durst come near them,\r\nbut lay still out of fear, some of the armed men girt on their armor,\r\nand by both their hands took hold of the chain by which the chests were\r\nlet down, and went into the mouths of the caves, because they fretted\r\nthat such delay was made by the robbers not daring to come out of the\r\ncaves; and when they were at any of those mouths, they first killed many\r\nof those that were in the mouths with their darts, and afterwards pulled\r\nthose to them that resisted them with their hooks, and tumbled them down\r\nthe precipices, and afterwards went into the caves, and killed many\r\nmore, and then went into their chests again, and lay still there; but,\r\nupon this, terror seized the rest, when they heard the lamentations that\r\nwere made, and they despaired of escaping. However, when the night came\r\non, that put an end to the whole work; and as the king proclaimed pardon\r\nby a herald to such as delivered themselves up to him, many accepted of\r\nthe offer. The same method of assault was made use of the next day; and\r\nthey went further, and got out in baskets to fight them, and fought them\r\nat their doors, and sent fire among them, and set their caves on fire,\r\nfor there was a great deal of combustible matter within them. Now there\r\nwas one old man who was caught within one of these caves, with seven\r\nchildren and a wife; these prayed him to give them leave to go out, and\r\nyield themselves up to the enemy; but he stood at the cave's mouth, and\r\nalways slew that child of his who went out, till he had destroyed them\r\nevery one, and after that he slew his wife, and cast their dead bodies\r\ndown the precipice, and himself after them, and so underwent death\r\nrather than slavery: but before he did this, he greatly reproached Herod\r\nwith the meanness of his family, although he was then king. Herod also\r\nsaw what he was doing, and stretched out his hand, and offered him all\r\nmanner of security for his life; by which means all these caves were at\r\nlength subdued entirely.\r\n\r\n6. And when the king had set Ptolemy over these parts of the country as\r\nhis general, he went to Samaria, with six hundred horsemen, and three\r\nthousand armed footmen, as intending to fight Antigonus. But still this\r\ncommand of the army did not succeed well with Ptolemy, but those that\r\nhad been troublesome to Galilee before attacked him, and slew him; and\r\nwhen they had done this, they fled among the lakes and places almost\r\ninaccessible laying waste and plundering whatsoever they could come at\r\nin those places. But Herod soon returned, and punished them for what\r\nthey had done; for some of these rebels he slew, and others of them, who\r\nhad fled to the strong holds he besieged, and both slew them, and\r\ndemolished their strong holds. And when he had thus put an end to their\r\nrebellion, he laid a fine upon the cities of a hundred talents.\r\n\r\n7. In the mean time, Pacorus was fallen in a battle, and the Parthians\r\nwere defeated, when Ventidius sent Macheras to the assistance of Herod,\r\nwith two legions, and a thousand horsemen, while Antony encouraged him\r\nto make haste. But Macheras, at the instigation of Antigonus, without\r\nthe approbation of Herod, as being corrupted by money, went about to\r\ntake a view of his affairs; but Antigonus suspecting this intention of\r\nhis coming, did not admit him into the city, but kept him at a distance,\r\nwith throwing stones at him, and plainly showed what he himself meant.\r\nBut when Macheras was sensible that Herod had given him good advice, and\r\nthat he had made a mistake himself in not hearkening to that advice, he\r\nretired to the city Emmaus; and what Jews he met with he slew them,\r\nwhether they were enemies or friends, out of the rage he was in at what\r\nhardships he had undergone. The king was provoked at this conduct of\r\nhis, and went to Samaria, and resolved to go to Antony about these\r\naffairs, and to inform him that he stood in no need of such helpers, who\r\ndid him more mischief than they did his enemies; and that he was able of\r\nhimself to beat Antigonus. But Macheras followed him, and desired that\r\nhe would not go to Antony; or if he was resolved to go, that he would\r\njoin his brother Joseph with them, and let them fight against Antigonus.\r\nSo he was reconciled to Macheras, upon his earnest entreaties.\r\nAccordingly, he left Joseph there with his army, but charged him to run\r\nno hazards, nor to quarrel with Macheras.\r\n\r\n8. But for his own part, he made haste to Antony [who was then at the\r\nsiege of Samosata, a place upon Euphrates] with his troops, both\r\nhorsemen and footmen, to be auxiliaries to him. And when he came to\r\nAntioch, and met there a great number of men gotten together that were\r\nvery desirous to go to Antony, but durst not venture to go, out of fear,\r\nbecause the barbarians fell upon men on the road, and slew many, so he\r\nencouraged them, and became their conductor upon the road. Now when they\r\nwere within two days' march of Samosata, the barbarians had laid an\r\nambush there to disturb those that came to Antony, and where the woods\r\nmade the passes narrow, as they led to the plains, there they laid not a\r\nfew of their horsemen, who were to lie still until those passengers were\r\ngone by into the wide place. Now as soon as the first ranks were gone\r\nby, [for Herod brought on the rear,] those that lay in ambush, who were\r\nabout five hundred, fell upon them on the sudden, and when they had put\r\nthe foremost to flight, the king came riding hard, with the forces that\r\nwere about him, and immediately drove back the enemy; by which means he\r\nmade the minds of his own men courageous, and imboldened them to go on,\r\ninsomuch that those who ran away before now returned back, and the\r\nbarbarians were slain on all sides. The king also went on killing them,\r\nand recovered all the baggage, among which were a great number of beasts\r\nfor burden, and of slaves, and proceeded on in his march; and whereas\r\nthere were a great number of those in the woods that attacked them, and\r\nwere near the passage that led into the plain, he made a sally upon\r\nthese also with a strong body of men, and put them to flight, and slew\r\nmany of them, and thereby rendered the way safe for those that came\r\nafter; and these called Herod their savior and protector.\r\n\r\n9. And when he was near to Samosata, Antony sent out his army in all\r\ntheir proper habiliments to meet him, in order to pay Herod this\r\nrespect, and because of the assistance he had given him; for he had\r\nheard what attacks the barbarians had made upon him [in Judea]. He also\r\nwas very glad to see him there, as having been made acquainted with the\r\ngreat actions he had performed upon the road. So he entertained him very\r\nkindly, and could not but admire his courage. Antony also embraced him\r\nas soon as he saw him, and saluted him after a most affectionate manner,\r\nand gave him the upper hand, as having himself lately made him a king;\r\nand in a little time Antiochus delivered up the fortress, and on that\r\naccount this war was at an end; then Antony committed the rest to\r\nSosius, and gave him orders to assist Herod, and went himself to Egypt.\r\nAccordingly, Sosius sent two legions before into Judea to the assistance\r\nof Herod, and he followed himself with the body of the army.\r\n\r\n10. Now Joseph was already slain in Judea, in the manner following: He\r\nforgot what charge his brother Herod had given him when he went to\r\nAntony; and when he had pitched his camp among the mountains, for\r\nMacheras had lent him five regiments, with these he went hastily to\r\nJericho, in order to reap the corn thereto belonging; and as the Roman\r\nregiments were but newly raised, and were unskillful in war, for they\r\nwere in great part collected out of Syria, he was attacked by the enemy,\r\nand caught in those places of difficulty, and was himself slain, as he\r\nwas fighting bravely, and the whole army was lost, for there were six\r\nregiments slain. So when Antigonus had got possession of the dead\r\nbodies, he cut off Joseph's head, although Pheroras his brother would\r\nhave redeemed it at the price of fifty talents. After which defeat, the\r\nGalileans revolted from their commanders, and took those of Herod's\r\nparty, and drowned them in the lake, and a great part of Judea was\r\nbecome seditious; but Macheras fortified the place Gitta [in Samaria].\r\n\r\n11. At this time messengers came to Herod, and informed him of what had\r\nbeen done; and when he was come to Daphne by Antioch, they told him of\r\nthe ill fortune that had befallen his brother; which yet he expected,\r\nfrom certain visions that appeared to him in his dreams, which clearly\r\nforeshowed his brother's death. So he hastened his march; and when he\r\ncame to Mount Libanus, he received about eight hundred of the men of\r\nthat place, having already with him also one Roman legion, and with\r\nthese he came to Ptolemais. He also marched thence by night with his\r\narmy, and proceeded along Galilee. Here it was that the enemy met him,\r\nand fought him, and were beaten, and shut up in the same place of\r\nstrength whence they had sallied out the day before. So he attacked the\r\nplace in the morning; but by reason of a great storm that was then very\r\nviolent, he was able to do nothing, but drew off his army into the\r\nneighboring villages; yet as soon as the other legion that Antony sent\r\nhim was come to his assistance, those that were in garrison in the place\r\nwere afraid, and deserted it in the night time. Then did the king march\r\nhastily to Jericho, intending to avenge himself on the enemy for the\r\nslaughter of his brother; and when he had pitched his tents, he made a\r\nfeast for the principal commanders; and after this collation was over,\r\nand he had dismissed his guests, he retired to his own chamber; and here\r\nmay one see what kindness God had for the king, for the upper part of\r\nthe house fell down when nobody was in it, and so killed none, insomuch\r\nthat all the people believed that Herod was beloved of God, since he had\r\nescaped such a great and surprising danger.\r\n\r\n12. But the next day six thousand of the enemy came down from the tops\r\nof the mountains to fight the Romans, which greatly terrified them; and\r\nthe soldiers that were in light armor came near, and pelted the king's\r\nguards that were come out with darts and stones, and one of them hit him\r\non the side with a dart. Antigonus also sent a commander against\r\nSamaria, whose name was Pappus, with some forces, being desirous to show\r\nthe enemy how potent he was, and that he had men to spare in his war\r\nwith them. He sat down to oppose Macheras; but Herod, when he had taken\r\nfive cities, took such as were left in them, being about two thousand,\r\nand slew them, and burnt the cities themselves, and then returned to go\r\nagainst Pappus, who was encamped at a village called Isanas; and there\r\nran in to him many out of Jericho and Judea, near to which places he\r\nwas, and the enemy fell upon his men, so stout were they at this time,\r\nand joined battle with them, but he beat them in the fight; and in order\r\nto be revenged on them for the slaughter of his brother, he pursued them\r\nsharply, and killed them as they ran away; and as the houses were full\r\nof armed men, 29 and many of them ran as far as the tops of the houses,\r\nhe got them under his power, and pulled down the roofs of the houses,\r\nand saw the lower rooms full of soldiers that were caught, and lay all\r\non a heap; so they threw stones down upon them as they lay piled one\r\nupon another, and thereby killed them; nor was there a more frightful\r\nspectacle in all the war than this, where beyond the walls an immense\r\nmultitude of dead men lay heaped one upon another. This action it was\r\nwhich chiefly brake the spirits of the enemy, who expected now what\r\nwould come; for there appeared a mighty number of people that came from\r\nplaces far distant, that were now about the village, but then ran away;\r\nand had it not been for the depth of winter, which then restrained them,\r\nthe king's army had presently gone to Jerusalem, as being very\r\ncourageous at this good success, and the whole work had been done\r\nimmediately; for Antigonus was already looking about how he might fly\r\naway and leave the city.\r\n\r\n13. At this time the king gave order that the soldiers should go to\r\nsupper, for it was late at night, while he went into a chamber to use\r\nthe bath, for he was very weary; and here it was that he was in the\r\ngreatest danger, which yet, by God's providence, he escaped; for as he\r\nwas naked, and had but one servant that followed him, to be with him\r\nwhile he was bathing in an inner room, certain of the enemy, who were in\r\ntheir armor, and had fled thither, out of fear, were then in the place;\r\nand as he was bathing, the first of them came out with his naked sword\r\ndrawn, and went out at the doors, and after him a second, and a third,\r\narmed in like manner, and were under such a consternation, that they did\r\nno hurt to the king, and thought themselves to have come off very well\r\nill suffering no harm themselves in their getting out of the house.\r\nHowever, on the next day, he cut off the head of Pappus, for he was\r\nalready slain, and sent it to Pheroras, as a punishment of what their\r\nbrother had suffered by his means, for he was the man that slew him with\r\nhis own hand.\r\n\r\n14. When the rigor of winter was over, Herod removed his army, and came\r\nnear to Jerusalem, and pitched his camp hard by the city. Now this was\r\nthe third year since he had been made king at Rome; and as he removed\r\nhis camp, and came near that part of the wall where it could be most\r\neasily assaulted, he pitched that camp before the temple, intending to\r\nmake his attacks in the same manner as did Pompey. So he encompassed the\r\nplace with three bulwarks, and erected towers, and employed a great many\r\nhands about the work, and cut down the trees that were round about the\r\ncity; and when he had appointed proper persons to oversee the works,\r\neven while the army lay before the city, he himself went to Samaria, to\r\ncomplete his marriage, and to take to wife the daughter of Alexander,\r\nthe son of Aristobulus; for he had betrothed her already, as I have\r\nbefore related.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16. How Herod, When He Had Married Mariamne Took Jerusalem With\r\nThe Assistance Of Sosius By Force; And How The Government Of The\r\nAsamoneans Was Put An End To.\r\n\r\n1. After the wedding was over, came Sosius through Phoenicia, having\r\nsent out his army before him over the midland parts. He also, who was\r\ntheir commander, came himself, with a great number of horsemen and\r\nfootmen. The king also came himself from Samaria, and brought with him\r\nno small army, besides that which was there before, for they were about\r\nthirty thousand; and they all met together at the walls of Jerusalem,\r\nand encamped at the north wall of the city, being now an army of eleven\r\nlegions, armed men on foot, and six thousand horsemen, with other\r\nauxiliaries out of Syria. The generals were two: Sosius, sent by Antony\r\nto assist Herod, and Herod on his own account, in order to take the\r\ngovernment from Antigonus, who was declared all enemy at Rome, and that\r\nhe might himself be king, according to the decree of the Senate.\r\n\r\n2. Now the Jews that were enclosed within the walls of the city fought\r\nagainst Herod with great alacrity and zeal [for the whole nation was\r\ngathered together]; they also gave out many prophecies about the temple,\r\nand many things agreeable to the people, as if God would deliver them\r\nout of the dangers they were in; they had also carried off what was out\r\nof the city, that they might not leave any thing to afford sustenance\r\neither for men or for beasts; and by private robberies they made the\r\nwant of necessaries greater. When Herod understood this, he opposed\r\nambushes in the fittest places against their private robberies, and he\r\nsent legions of armed men to bring its provisions, and that from remote\r\nplaces, so that in a little time they had great plenty of provisions.\r\nNow the three bulwarks were easily erected, because so many hands were\r\ncontinually at work upon it; for it was summer time, and there was\r\nnothing to hinder them in raising their works, neither from the air nor\r\nfrom the workmen; so they brought their engines to bear, and shook the\r\nwalls of the city, and tried all manner of ways to get it; yet did not\r\nthose within discover any fear, but they also contrived not a few\r\nengines to oppose their engines withal. They also sallied out, and burnt\r\nnot only those engines that were not yet perfected, but those that were;\r\nand when they came hand to hand, their attempts were not less bold than\r\nthose of the Romans, though they were behind them in skill. They also\r\nerected new works when the former were ruined, and making mines\r\nunderground, they met each other, and fought there; and making use of\r\nbrutish courage rather than of prudent valor, they persisted in this war\r\nto the very last; and this they did while a mighty army lay round about\r\nthem, and while they were distressed by famine and the want of\r\nnecessaries, for this happened to be a Sabbatic year. The first that\r\nscaled the walls were twenty chosen men, the next were Sosius's\r\ncenturions; for the first wall was taken in forty days, and the second\r\nin fifteen more, when some of the cloisters that were about the temple\r\nwere burnt, which Herod gave out to have been burnt by Antigonus, in\r\norder to expose him to the hatred of the Jews. And when the outer court\r\nof the temple and the lower city were taken, the Jews fled into the\r\ninner court of the temple, and into the upper city; but now fearing lest\r\nthe Romans should hinder them from offering their daily sacrifices to\r\nGod, they sent an embassage, and desired that they would only permit\r\nthem to bring in beasts for sacrifices, which Herod granted, hoping they\r\nwere going to yield; but when he saw that they did nothing of what he\r\nsupposed, but bitterly opposed him, in order to preserve the kingdom to\r\nAntigonus, he made an assault upon the city, and took it by storm; and\r\nnow all parts were full of those that were slain, by the rage of the\r\nRomans at the long duration of the siege, and by the zeal of the Jews\r\nthat were on Herod's side, who were not willing to leave one of their\r\nadversaries alive; so they were murdered continually in the narrow\r\nstreets and in the houses by crowds, and as they were flying to the\r\ntemple for shelter, and there was no pity taken of either infants or the\r\naged, nor did they spare so much as the weaker sex; nay, although the\r\nking sent about, and besought them to spare the people, yet nobody\r\nrestrained their hand from slaughter, but, as if they were a company of\r\nmadmen, they fell upon persons of all ages, without distinction; and\r\nthen Antigonus, without regard to either his past or present\r\ncircumstances, came down from the citadel, and fell down at the feet of\r\nSosius, who took no pity of him, in the change of his fortune, but\r\ninsulted him beyond measure, and called him Antigone [i.e. a woman, and\r\nnot a man;] yet did he not treat him as if he were a woman, by letting\r\nhim go at liberty, but put him into bonds, and kept him in close\r\ncustody.\r\n\r\n3. And now Herod having overcome his enemies, his care was to govern\r\nthose foreigners who had been his assistants, for the crowd of strangers\r\nrushed to see the temple, and the sacred things in the temple; but the\r\nking, thinking a victory to be a more severe affliction than a defeat,\r\nif any of those things which it was not lawful to see should be seen by\r\nthem, used entreaties and threatenings, and even sometimes force itself,\r\nto restrain them. He also prohibited the ravage that was made in the\r\ncity, and many times asked Sosius whether the Romans would empty the\r\ncity both of money and men, and leave him king of a desert; and told him\r\nthat he esteemed the dominion over the whole habitable earth as by no\r\nmeans an equivalent satisfaction for such a murder of his citizens'; and\r\nwhen he said that this plunder was justly to be permitted the soldiers\r\nfor the siege they had undergone, he replied, that he would give every\r\none their reward out of his own money; and by this means be redeemed\r\nwhat remained of the city from destruction; and he performed what he had\r\npromised him, for he gave a noble present to every soldier, and a\r\nproportionable present to their commanders, but a most royal present to\r\nSosius himself, till they all went away full of money.\r\n\r\n4. This destruction befell the city of Jerusalem when Marcus Agrippa and\r\nCaninius Gallus were consuls of Rome 30 on the hundred eighty and fifth\r\nolympiad, on the third month, on the solemnity of the fast, as if a\r\nperiodical revolution of calamities had returned since that which befell\r\nthe Jews under Pompey; for the Jews were taken by him on the same day,\r\nand this was after twenty-seven years' time. So when Sosius had\r\ndedicated a crown of gold to God, he marched away from Jerusalem, and\r\ncarried Antigonus with him in bonds to Antony; but Herod was afraid lest\r\nAntigonus should be kept in prison [only] by Antony, and that when he\r\nwas carried to Rome by him, he might get his cause to be heard by the\r\nsenate, and might demonstrate, as he was himself of the royal blood, and\r\nHerod but a private man, that therefore it belonged to his sons however\r\nto have the kingdom, on account of the family they were of, in case he\r\nhad himself offended the Romans by what he had done. Out of Herod's fear\r\nof this it was that he, by giving Antony a great deal of money,\r\nendeavored to persuade him to have Antigonus slain, which if it were\r\nonce done, he should be free from that fear. And thus did the government\r\nof the Asamoneans cease, a hundred twenty and six years after it was\r\nfirst set up. This family was a splendid and an illustrious one, both on\r\naccount of the nobility of their stock, and of the dignity of the high\r\npriesthood, as also for the glorious actions their ancestors had\r\nperformed for our nation; but these men lost the government by their\r\ndissensions one with another, and it came to Herod, the son of\r\nAntipater, who was of no more than a vulgar family, and of no eminent\r\nextraction, but one that was subject to other kings. And this is what\r\nhistory tells us was the end of the Asamonean family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Reland takes notice here, very justly, how Josephus's\r\ndeclaration, that it was his great concern not only to write \"an\r\nagreeable, an accurate,\" and \"a true\" history, but also distinctly not\r\nto omit any thing [of consequence], either through \"ignorance or\r\nlaziness,\" implies that he could not, consistently with that resolution,\r\nomit the mention of [so famous a person as] \"Jesus Christ.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ That the famous Antipater's or Antipas's father was also\r\nAntipater or Antipas [which two may justly be esteemed one and the same\r\nframe, the former with a Greek or Gentile, the latter with a Hebrew or\r\nJewish termination] Josephus here assures us, though Eusebias indeed\r\nsays it was Herod.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ This \"golden vine,\" or \"garden,\" seen by Strabo at Rome,\r\nhas its inscription here as if it were the gift of Alexander, the father\r\nof Aristobulus, and not of Aristobulus himself, to whom yet Josephus\r\nascribes it; and in order to prove the truth of that part of his\r\nhistory, introduces this testimony of Strabo; so that the ordinary\r\ncopies seem to be here either erroneous or defective, and the original\r\nreading seems to have been either Aristobulus, instead of Alexander,\r\nwith one Greek copy, or else \"Aristobulus the son of Alexander,\" with\r\nthe Latin copies; which last seems to me the most probable. For as to\r\nArchbishop Usher's conjectures, that Alexander made it, and dedicated it\r\nto God in the temple, and that thence Aristobulus took it, and sent it\r\nto Pompey, they are both very improbable, and no way agreeable to\r\nJosephus, who would hardly have avoided the recording both these\r\nuncommon points of history, had he known any thing of them; nor would\r\neither the Jewish nation, or even Pompey himself, then have relished\r\nsuch a flagrant instance of sacrilege.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ These express testimonies of Josephus here, and Antiq.

XVI. p. 763; from\r\nwhom we learn that this ditch was sixty feet deep, and two hundred and\r\nfifty feet broad. However, its depth is, in the next section, said by\r\nJosephus to be immense, which exactly agrees to Strabo's description,\r\nand which numbers in Strabo are a strong confirmation of the truth of\r\nJosephus's description also.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 (return) [ That is, on the 23rd of Sivan, the annual fast for the\r\ndefection and idolatry of Jeroboam, \"who made Israel to sin;\" or\r\npossibly some other fast might fall into that month, before and in the\r\ndays of Josephus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 (return) [ It deserves here to be noted, that this Pharisaical,\r\nsuperstitious notion, that offensive fighting was unlawful to Jews, even\r\nunder the utmost necessity, on the Sabbath day, of which we hear nothing\r\nbefore the times of the Maccabees, was the proper occasion of\r\nJerusalem's being taken by Pompey, by Sosius, and by Titus, as appears\r\nfrom the places already quoted in the note on Antiq. B. XIII. ch. 8.\r\nsect. 1; which scrupulous superstition, as to the observation of such a\r\nrigorous rest upon the Sabbath day, our Savior always opposed, when the\r\nPharisaical Jews insisted on it, as is evident in many places in the New\r\nTestament, though he still intimated how pernicious that superstition\r\nmight prove to them in their flight from the Romans, Matthew 25:20.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8 (return) [ This is fully confirmed by the testimony of Cicero, who:\r\nsays, in his oration for Flaecus, that \"Cneius Pompeius, when he was\r\nconqueror, and had taken Jerusalem, did not touch any thing belonging to\r\nthat temple.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n9 (return) [ Of this destruction of Gadara here presupposed, and its\r\nrestoration by Pompey, see the note on the War, B.

One may easily believe that Josephus gave order for one\r\nthing, and his amanuensis performed another, by transposing decrees that\r\nconcerned the Hyrcani, and as deluded by the sameness of their names;\r\nfor that belongs to the first high priest of this name, [John Hyrcanus,]\r\nwhich Josephus here ascribes to one that lived later [Hyrcanus, the son\r\nof Alexander Janneus]. However, the decree which he proposes to set down\r\nfollows a little lower, in the collection of Raman decrees that\r\nconcerned the Jews and is that dated when Cæsar was consul the fifth\r\ntime.\" See ch. 10. sect. 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14 (return) [ Those who will carefully observe the several occasional\r\nnumbers and chronological characters in the life and death of this\r\nHerod, and of his children, hereafter noted, will see that twenty-five\r\nyears, and not fifteen, must for certain have been here Josephus's own\r\nnumber for the age of Herod, when he was made governor of Galilee. See\r\nch. 23. sect. 5, and ch. 24. sect. 7; and particularly Antiq. B.

See the like full evidence of the\r\nkindred of the Lacedemonians and the Jews; and that became they were\r\nboth of the posterity of Abraham, by a public epistle of those people to\r\nthe Jews, preserved in the First Book of the Maccabees, 12:19-23; and\r\nthence by Josephus, Antiq. B. XII. ch. 4 sect. 10; both which authentic\r\nrecords are highly valuable. It is also well worthy of observation, what\r\nMoses Chorenensis, the principal Armenian historian, informs us of, p.\r\n83, that Arsaces, who raised the Parthian empire, was of the seed of\r\nAbraham by Chetura; and that thereby was accomplished that prediction\r\nwhich said, \"Kings of nations shall proceed from thee,\" Genesis 17:6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20 (return) [ If we compare Josephus's promise in sect. 1, to produce\r\nall the public decrees of the Romans in favor of the Jews, with his\r\nexcuse here for omitting many of them, we may observe, that when he came\r\nto transcribe all those decrees he had collected, he found them so\r\nnumerous, that he thought he should too much tire his readers if he had\r\nattempted it, which he thought a sufficient apology for his omitting the\r\nrest of them; yet do those by him produced afford such a strong\r\nconfirmation to his history, and give such great light to even the Roman\r\nantiquities themselves, that I believe the curious are not a little\r\nsorry for such his omissions.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21 (return) [ For Marcus, this president of Syria, sent as successor to\r\nSextus Cæsar, the Roman historians require us to read \"Marcus\" in\r\nJosephus, and this perpetually, both in these Antiquities, and in his\r\nHistory of the Wars, as the learned generally agree.]\r\n\r\n\r\n22 (return) [ In this and the following chapters the reader will easily\r\nremark, how truly Gronovius observes, in his notes on the Roman decrees\r\nin favor of the Jews, that their rights and privileges were commonly\r\npurchased of the Romans with money. Many examples of this sort, both as\r\nto the Romans and others in authority, will occur in our Josephus, both\r\nnow and hereafter, and need not be taken particular notice of on the\r\nseveral occasions in these notes. Accordingly, the chief captain\r\nconfesses to St. Paul that \"with a great sum he had obtained his\r\nfreedom,\" Acts 22:28; as had St. Paul's ancestors, very probably,\r\npurchased the like freedom for their family by money, as the same author\r\njustly concludes also.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23 (return) [ This clause plainly alludes to that well-known but unusual\r\nand very long darkness of the sun which happened upon the murder of\r\nJulius Cæsar by Brutus and Cassius, which is greatly taken notice of by\r\nVirgil, Pliny, and other Roman authors.

See Matthew 24:17; Mark 13:15; Luke\r\n5:19; 17:31.]\r\n\r\n\r\n30 (return) [ Note here, that Josephus fully and frequently assures us\r\nthat there passed above three years between Herod's first obtaining the\r\nkingdom at Rome, and his second obtaining it upon the taking of\r\nJerusalem and death of Antigonus. The present history of this interval\r\ntwice mentions the army going into winter quarters, which perhaps\r\nbelonged to two several winters, ch. 15. sect. 3, 4; and though Josephus\r\nsays nothing how long they lay in those quarters, yet does he give such\r\nan account of the long and studied delays of Ventidius, Silo, and\r\nMacheras, who were to see Herod settled in his new kingdom, but seem not\r\nto have had sufficient forces for that purpose, and were for certain all\r\ncorrupted by Antigonus to make the longest delays possible, and gives us\r\nsuch particular accounts of the many great actions of Herod during the\r\nsame interval, as fairly imply that interval, before Herod went to\r\nSamosata, to have been very considerable. However, what is wanting in\r\nJosephus, is fully supplied by Moses Chorenensis, the Armenian\r\nhistorian, in his history of that interval, B. II ch. 18., where he\r\ndirectly assures us that Tigranes, then king of Armenia, and the\r\nprincipal manager of this Parthian war, reigned two years after Herod\r\nwas made king at Rome, and yet Antony did not hear of his death, in that\r\nvery neighborhood, at Samosata, till he was come thither to besiege it;\r\nafter which Herod brought him an army, which was three hundred and forty\r\nmiles' march, and through a difficult country, full of enemies also, and\r\njoined with him in the siege of Samosata till that city was taken; then\r\nHerod and Sosins marched back with their large armies the same number of\r\nthree hundred and forty miles; and when, in a little time, they sat down\r\nto besiege Jerusalem, they were not able to take it but by a siege of\r\nfive months. All which put together, fully supplies what is wanting in\r\nJosephus, and secures the entire chronology of these times beyond\r\ncontradiction.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XV. Containing The Interval Of Eighteen Years.—From The Death Of\r\nAntigonus To The Finishing Of The Temple By Herod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. Concerning Pollio And Sameas. Herod Slays The Principal Of\r\nAntigonus's Friends, And Spoils The City Of Its Wealth. Antony Beheads\r\nAntigonus.\r\n\r\n1. How Sosius and Herod took Jerusalem by force; and besides that, how\r\nthey took Antigonus captive, has been related by us in the foregoing\r\nbook. We will now proceed in the narration. And since Herod had now the\r\ngovernment of all Judea put into his hands, he promoted such of the\r\nprivate men in the city as had been of his party, but never left off\r\navenging and punishing every day those that had chosen to be of the\r\nparty of his enemies. But Pollio the Pharisee, and Sameas, a disciple of\r\nhis, were honored by him above all the rest; for when Jerusalem was\r\nbesieged, they advised the citizens to receive Herod, for which advice\r\nthey were well requited. But this Pollio, at the time when Herod was\r\nonce upon his trial of life and death, foretold, in way of reproach, to\r\nHyrcanus and the other judges, how this Herod, whom they suffered now to\r\nescape, would afterward inflict punishment on them all; which had its\r\ncompletion in time, while God fulfilled the words he had spoken.\r\n\r\n2. At this time Herod, now he had got Jerusalem under his power, carried\r\noff all the royal ornaments, and spoiled the wealthy men of what they\r\nhad gotten; and when, by these means, he had heaped together a great\r\nquantity of silver and gold, he gave it all to Antony, and his friends\r\nthat were about him. He also slew forty-five of the principal men of\r\nAntigonus's party, and set guards at the gates of the city, that nothing\r\nmight be carried out together with their dead bodies. They also searched\r\nthe dead, and whatsoever was found, either of silver or gold, or other\r\ntreasure, it was carried to the king; nor was there any end of the\r\nmiseries he brought upon them; and this distress was in part occasioned\r\nby the covetousness of the prince regent, who was still in want of more,\r\nand in part by the Sabbatic year, which was still going on, and forced\r\nthe country to lie still uncultivated, since we are forbidden to sow our\r\nland in that year. Now when Antony had received Antigonus as his\r\ncaptive, he determined to keep him against his triumph; but when he\r\nheard that the nation grew seditious, and that, out of their hatred to\r\nHerod, they continued to bear good-will to Antigonus, he resolved to\r\nbehead him at Antioch, for otherwise the Jews could no way be brought to\r\nbe quiet. And Strabo of Cappadocia attests to what I have said, when he\r\nthus speaks: \"Antony ordered Antigonus the Jew to be brought to Antioch,\r\nand there to be beheaded. And this Antony seems to me to have been the\r\nvery first man who beheaded a king, as supposing he could no other way\r\nbend the minds of the Jews so as to receive Herod, whom he had made king\r\nin his stead; for by no torments could they be forced to call him king,\r\nso great a fondness they had for their former king; so he thought that\r\nthis dishonorable death would diminish the value they had for\r\nAntigonus's memory, and at the same time would diminish the hatred they\r\nbare to Herod.\" Thus far Strabo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How Hyrcanus Was Set At Liberty By The Parthians, And\r\nReturned To Herod; And What Alexandra Did When She Heard That Ananelus\r\nWas Made High Priest.\r\n\r\n1. Now after Herod was in possession of the kingdom, Hyrcanus the high\r\npriest, who was then a captive among the Parthians, came to him again,\r\nand was set free from his captivity, in the manner following:\r\nBarzapharnes and Pacorus, the generals of the Parthians, took Hyrcanus,\r\nwho was first made high priest and afterward king, and Herod's brother,\r\nPhasaelus captives, and were them away into Parthia. Phasaelus indeed\r\ncould not bear the reproach of being in bonds; and thinking that death\r\nwith glory was better than any life whatsoever, he became his own\r\nexecutioner, as I have formerly related.\r\n\r\n2. But when Hyrcanus was brought into Parthia the king Phraates treated\r\nhim after a very gentle manner, as having already learned of what an\r\nillustrious family he was; on which account he set him free from his\r\nbonds, and gave him a habitation at Babylon, 1 where there were Jews in\r\ngreat numbers. These Jews honored Hyrcanus as their high priest and\r\nking, as did all the Jewish nation that dwelt as far as Euphrates; which\r\nrespect was very much to his satisfaction. But when he was informed that\r\nHerod had received the kingdom, new hopes came upon him, as having been\r\nhimself still of a kind disposition towards him, and expecting that\r\nHerod would bear in mind what favor he had received from him; and when\r\nhe was upon his trial, and when he was in danger that a capital sentence\r\nwould be pronounced against him, he delivered him from that danger, and\r\nfrom all punishment. Accordingly, he talked of that matter with the Jews\r\nthat came often to him with great affection; but they endeavored to\r\nretain him among them, and desired that he would stay with them, putting\r\nhim in mind of the kind offices and honors they did him, and that those\r\nhonors they paid him were not at all inferior to what they could pay to\r\neither their high priests or their kings; and what was a greater motive\r\nto determine him, they said, was this, that he could not have those\r\ndignities [in Judea] because of that maim in his body, which had been\r\ninflicted on him by Antigonus; and that kings do not use to requite men\r\nfor those kindnesses which they received when they were private persons,\r\nthe height of their fortune making usually no small changes in them.\r\n\r\n3. Now although they suggested these arguments to him for his own\r\nadvantage, yet did Hyrcanus still desire to depart. Herod also wrote to\r\nhim, and persuaded him to desire of Phraates, and the Jews that were\r\nthere, that they should not grudge him the royal authority, which he\r\nshould have jointly with himself, for that now was the proper time for\r\nhimself to make him amends for the favors he had received from him, as\r\nhaving been brought up by him, and saved by him also, as well as for\r\nHyrcanus to receive it. And as he wrote thus to Hyrcanus, so did he send\r\nalso Saramallas, his ambassador, to Phraates, and many presents with\r\nhim, and desired him in the most obliging way that he would be no\r\nhinderance to his gratitude towards his benefactor. But this zeal of\r\nHerod's did not flow from that principle, but because he had been made\r\ngovernor of that country without having any just claim to it, he was\r\nafraid, and that upon reasons good enough, of a change in his condition,\r\nand so made what haste he could to get Hyrcanus into his power, or\r\nindeed to put him quite out of the way; which last thing he compassed\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\n4. Accordingly, when Hyrcanus came, full of assurance, by the permission\r\nof the king of Parthia, and at the expense of the Jews, who supplied him\r\nwith money, Herod received him with all possible respect, and gave him\r\nthe upper place at public meetings, and set him above all the rest at\r\nfeasts, and thereby deceived him. He called him his father, and\r\nendeavored, by all the ways possible, that he might have no suspicion of\r\nany treacherous design against him. He also did other things, in order\r\nto secure his government, which yet occasioned a sedition in his own\r\nfamily; for being cautious how he made any illustrious person the high\r\npriest of God, 2 he sent for an obscure priest out of Babylon, whose\r\nname was Ananelus, and bestowed the high priesthood upon him.\r\n\r\n5. However, Alexandra, the daughter of Hyrcanus, and wife of Alexander,\r\nthe son of Aristobulus the king, who had also brought Alexander [two]\r\nchildren, could not bear this indignity. Now this son was one of the\r\ngreatest comeliness, and was called Aristobulus; and the daughter,\r\nMariamne, was married to Herod, and eminent for her beauty also. This\r\nAlexandra was much disturbed, and took this indignity offered to her son\r\nexceeding ill, that while he was alive, any one else should be sent for\r\nto have the dignity of the high priesthood conferred upon him.\r\nAccordingly, she wrote to Cleopatra [a musician assisting her in taking\r\ncare to have her letters carried] to desire her intercession with\r\nAntony, in order to gain the high priesthood for her son.\r\n\r\n6. But as Antony was slow in granting this request, his friend Dellius 3\r\ncame into Judea upon some affairs; and when he saw Aristobulus, he stood\r\nin admiration at the tallness and handsomeness of the child, and no less\r\nat Mariamne, the king's wife, and was open in his commendations of\r\nAlexandra, as the mother of most beautiful children. And when she came\r\nto discourse with him, he persuaded her to get pictures drawn of them\r\nboth, and to send them to Antony, for that when he saw them, he would\r\ndeny her nothing that she should ask. Accordingly, Alexandra was\r\nelevated with these words of his, and sent the pictures to Antony.\r\nDellius also talked extravagantly, and said that these children seemed\r\nnot derived from men, but from some god or other. His design in doing so\r\nwas to entice Antony into lewd pleasures with them, who was ashamed to\r\nsend for the damsel, as being the wife of Herod, and avoided it, because\r\nof the reproaches he should have from Cleopatra on that account; but he\r\nsent, in the most decent manner he could, for the young man; but added\r\nthis withal, unless he thought it hard upon him so to do. When this\r\nletter was brought to Herod, he did not think it safe for him to send\r\none so handsome as was Aristobulus, in the prime of his life, for he was\r\nsixteen years of age, and of so noble a family, and particularly not to\r\nAntony, the principal man among the Romans, and one that would abuse him\r\nin his amours, and besides, one that openly indulged himself in such\r\npleasures as his power allowed him without control. He therefore wrote\r\nback to him, that if this boy should only go out of the country, all\r\nwould be in a state of war and uproar, because the Jews were in hopes of\r\na change in the government, and to have another king over them.\r\n\r\n7. When Herod had thus excused himself to Antony, he resolved that he\r\nwould not entirely permit the child or Alexandra to be treated\r\ndishonorably; but his wife Mariamne lay vehemently at him to restore the\r\nhigh priesthood to her brother; and he judged it was for his advantage\r\nso to do, because if he once had that dignity, he could not go out of\r\nthe country. So he called his friends together, and told them that\r\nAlexandra privately conspired against his royal authority, and\r\nendeavored, by the means of Cleopatra, so to bring it about, that he\r\nmight be deprived of the government, and that by Antony's means this\r\nyouth might have the management of public affairs in his stead; and that\r\nthis procedure of hers was unjust, since she would at the same time\r\ndeprive her daughter of the dignity she now had, and would bring\r\ndisturbances upon the kingdom, for which he had taken a great deal of\r\npains, and had gotten it with extraordinary hazards; that yet, while he\r\nwell remembered her wicked practices, he would not leave off doing what\r\nwas right himself, but would even now give the youth the high\r\npriesthood; and that he formerly set up Ananelus, because Aristobulus\r\nwas then so very young a child. Now when he had said this, not at\r\nrandom, but as he thought with the best discretion he had, in order to\r\ndeceive the women, and those friends whom he had taken to consult\r\nwithal, Alexandra, out of the great joy she had at this unexpected\r\npromise, and out of fear from the suspicions she lay under, fell a\r\nweeping; and made the following apology for herself; and said, that as\r\nto the [high] priesthood, she was very much concerned for the disgrace\r\nher son was under, and so did her utmost endeavors to procure it for\r\nhim; but that as to the kingdom, she had made no attempts, and that if\r\nit were offered her [for her son], she would not accept it; and that now\r\nshe would be satisfied with her son's dignity, while he himself held the\r\ncivil government, and she had thereby the security that arose from his\r\npeculiar ability in governing to all the remainder of her family; that\r\nshe was now overcome by his benefits, and thankfully accepted of this\r\nhonor showed by him to her son, and that she would hereafter be entirely\r\nobedient. And she desired him to excuse her, if the nobility of her\r\nfamily, and that freedom of acting which she thought that allowed her,\r\nhad made her act too precipitately and imprudently in this matter. So\r\nwhen they had spoken thus to one another, they came to an agreement, and\r\nall suspicions, so far as appeared, were vanished away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How Herod Upon His Making Aristobulus High Priest Took Care\r\nThat He Should Be Murdered In A Little Time; And What Apology He Made To\r\nAntony About Aristobulus; As Also Concerning Joseph And Mariamne.\r\n\r\n1. So king Herod immediately took the high priesthood away from\r\nAnanelus, who, as we said before, was not of this country, but one of\r\nthose Jews that had been carried captive beyond Euphrates; for there\r\nwere not a few ten thousands of this people that had been carried\r\ncaptives, and dwelt about Babylonia, whence Ananelus came. He was one of\r\nthe stock of the high priests 4 and had been of old a particular friend\r\nof Herod; and when he was first made king, he conferred that dignity\r\nupon him, and now put him out of it again, in order to quiet the\r\ntroubles in his family, though what he did was plainly unlawful, for at\r\nno other time [of old] was any one that had once been in that dignity\r\ndeprived of it. It was Antiochus Epiphanes who first brake that law, and\r\ndeprived Jesus, and made his brother Onias high priest in his stead.\r\nAristobulus was the second that did so, and took that dignity from his\r\nbrother [Hyrcanus]; and this Herod was the third, who took that high\r\noffice away [from Ananelus], and gave it to this young man, Aristobulus,\r\nin his stead.\r\n\r\n2. And now Herod seemed to have healed the divisions in his family; yet\r\nwas he not without suspicion, as is frequently the case, of people\r\nseeming to be reconciled to one another, but thought that, as Alexandra\r\nhad already made attempts tending to innovations, so did he fear that\r\nshe would go on therein, if she found a fit opportunity for so doing; so\r\nhe gave a command that she should dwell in the palace, and meddle with\r\nno public affairs. Her guards also were so careful, that nothing she did\r\nin private life every day was concealed. All these hardships put her out\r\nof patience, by little and little and she began to hate Herod; for as\r\nshe had the pride of a woman to the utmost degree, she had great\r\nindignation at this suspicious guard that was about her, as desirous\r\nrather to undergo any thing that could befall her, than to be deprived\r\nof her liberty of speech, and, under the notion of an honorary guard, to\r\nlive in a state of slavery and terror. She therefore sent to Cleopatra,\r\nand made a long complaint of the circumstances she was in, and entreated\r\nher to do her utmost for her assistance. Cleopatra hereupon advised her\r\nto take her son with her, and come away immediately to her into Egypt.\r\nThis advice pleased her; and she had this contrivance for getting away:\r\nShe got two coffins made, as if they were to carry away two dead bodies\r\nand put herself into one, and her son into the other and gave orders to\r\nsuch of her servants as knew of her intentions to carry them away in the\r\nnight time. Now their road was to be thence to the sea-side and there\r\nwas a ship ready to carry them into Egypt. Now Aesop, one of her\r\nservants, happened to fall upon Sabion, one of her friends, and spake of\r\nthis matter to him, as thinking he had known of it before. When Sabion\r\nknew this, [who had formerly been an enemy of Herod, and been esteemed\r\none of those that laid snares for and gave the poison to [his father]\r\nAntipater,] he expected that this discovery would change Herod's hatred\r\ninto kindness; so he told the king of this private stratagem of\r\nAlexandra: whereupon be suffered her to proceed to the execution of her\r\nproject, and caught her in the very fact; but still he passed by her\r\noffense; and though he had a great mind to do it, he durst not inflict\r\nany thing that was severe upon her, for he knew that Cleopatra would not\r\nbear that he should have her accused, on account of her hatred to him;\r\nbut made a show as if it were rather the generosity of his soul, and his\r\ngreat moderation, that made him forgive them. However, he fully proposed\r\nto himself to put this young man out of the way, by one means or other;\r\nbut he thought he might in probability be better concealed in doing it,\r\nif he did it not presently, nor immediately after what had lately\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n3. And now, upon the approach of the feast of tabernacles, which is a\r\nfestival very much observed among us, he let those days pass over, and\r\nboth he and the rest of the people were therein very merry; yet did the\r\nenvy which at this time arose in him cause him to make haste to do what\r\nhe was about, and provoke him to it; for when this youth Aristobulus,\r\nwho was now in the seventeenth year of his age, went up to the altar,\r\naccording to the law, to offer the sacrifices, and this with the\r\nornaments of his high priesthood, and when he performed the sacred\r\noffices, 5 he seemed to be exceedingly comely, and taller than men\r\nusually were at that age, and to exhibit in his countenance a great deal\r\nof that high family he was sprung from,—a warm zeal and affection\r\ntowards him appeared among the people, and the memory of the actions of\r\nhis grandfather Aristobulus was fresh in their minds; and their\r\naffections got so far the mastery of them, that they could not forbear\r\nto show their inclinations to him. They at once rejoiced and were\r\nconfounded, and mingled with good wishes their joyful acclamations which\r\nthey made to him, till the good-will of the multitude was made too\r\nevident; and they more rashly proclaimed the happiness they had received\r\nfrom his family than was fit under a monarchy to have done. Upon all\r\nthis, Herod resolved to complete what he had intended against the young\r\nman. When therefore the festival was over, and he was feasting at\r\nJericho 6 with Alexandra, who entertained them there, he was then very\r\npleasant with the young man, and drew him into a lonely place, and at\r\nthe same time played with him in a juvenile and ludicrous manner. Now\r\nthe nature of that place was hotter than ordinary; so they went out in a\r\nbody, and of a sudden, and in a vein of madness; and as they stood by\r\nthe fish-ponds, of which there were large ones about the house, they\r\nwent to cool themselves [by bathing], because it was in the midst of a\r\nhot day. At first they were only spectators of Herod's servants and\r\nacquaintance as they were swimming; but after a while, the young man, at\r\nthe instigation of Herod, went into the water among them, while such of\r\nHerod's acquaintance, as he had appointed to do it, dipped him as he was\r\nswimming, and plunged him under water, in the dark of the evening, as if\r\nit had been done in sport only; nor did they desist till he was entirely\r\nsuffocated. And thus was Aristobulus murdered, having lived no more in\r\nall than eighteen years, 7 and kept the high priesthood one year only;\r\nwhich high priesthood Ananelus now recovered again.\r\n\r\n4. When this sad accident was told the women, their joy was soon changed\r\nto lamentation, at the sight of the dead body that lay before them, and\r\ntheir sorrow was immoderate. The city also [of Jerusalem], upon the\r\nspreading of this news, were in very great grief, every family looking\r\non this calamity as if it had not belonged to another, but that one of\r\nthemselves was slain. But Alexandra was more deeply affected, upon her\r\nknowledge that he had been destroyed [on purpose]. Her sorrow was\r\ngreater than that of others, by her knowing how the murder was\r\ncommitted; but she was under the necessity of bearing up under it, out\r\nof her prospect of a greater mischief that might otherwise follow; and\r\nshe oftentimes came to an inclination to kill herself with her own hand,\r\nbut still she restrained herself, in hopes she might live long enough to\r\nrevenge the unjust murder thus privately committed; nay, she further\r\nresolved to endeavor to live longer, and to give no occasion to think\r\nshe suspected that her son was slain on purpose, and supposed that she\r\nmight thereby be in a capacity of revenging it at a proper opportunity.\r\nThus did she restrain herself, that she might not be noted for\r\nentertaining any such suspicion. However, Herod endeavored that none\r\nabroad should believe that the child's death was caused by any design of\r\nhis; and for this purpose he did not only use the ordinary signs of\r\nsorrow, but fell into tears also, and exhibited a real confusion of\r\nsoul; and perhaps his affections were overcome on this occasion, when he\r\nsaw the child's countenance so young and so beautiful, although his\r\ndeath was supposed to tend to his own security. So far at least this\r\ngrief served as to make some apology for him; and as for his funeral,\r\nthat he took care should be very magnificent, by making great\r\npreparation for a sepulcher to lay his body in, and providing a great\r\nquantity of spices, and burying many ornaments together with him, till\r\nthe very women, who were in such deep sorrow, were astonished at it, and\r\nreceived in this way some consolation.\r\n\r\n5. However, no such things could overcome Alexandra's grief; but the\r\nremembrance of this miserable case made her sorrow, both deep and\r\nobstinate. Accordingly, she wrote an account of this treacherous scene\r\nto Cleopatra, and how her son was murdered; but Cleopatra, as she had\r\nformerly been desirous to give her what satisfaction she could, and\r\ncommiserating Alexandra's misfortunes, made the case her own, and would\r\nnot let Antony be quiet, but excited him to punish the child's murder;\r\nfor that it was an unworthy thing that Herod, who had been by him made\r\nking of a kingdom that no way belonged to him, should be guilty of such\r\nhorrid crimes against those that were of the royal blood in reality.\r\nAntony was persuaded by these arguments; and when he came to Laodicea,\r\nhe sent and commanded Herod to come and make his defense, as to what he\r\nhad done to Aristobulus, for that such a treacherous design was not well\r\ndone, if he had any hand in it. Herod was now in fear, both of the\r\naccusation, and of Cleopatra's ill-will to him, which was such that she\r\nwas ever endeavoring to make Antony hate him. He therefore determined to\r\nobey his summons, for he had no possible way to avoid it. So he left his\r\nuncle Joseph procurator for his government, and for the public affairs,\r\nand gave him a private charge, that if Antony should kill him, he also\r\nshould kill Mariamne immediately; for that he had a tender affection for\r\nthis his wife, and was afraid of the injury that should be offered him,\r\nif, after his death, she, for her beauty, should be engaged to some\r\nother man: but his intimation was nothing but this at the bottom, that\r\nAntony had fallen in love with her, when he had formerly heard somewhat\r\nof her beauty. So when Herod had given Joseph this charge, and had\r\nindeed no sure hopes of escaping with his life, he went away to Antony.\r\n\r\n6. But as Joseph was administering the public affairs of the kingdom,\r\nand for that reason was very frequently with Mariamne, both because his\r\nbusiness required it, and because of the respects he ought to pay to the\r\nqueen, he frequently let himself into discourses about Herod's kindness,\r\nand great affection towards her; and when the women, especially\r\nAlexandra, used to turn his discourses into feminine raillery, Joseph\r\nwas so over-desirous to demonstrate the kings inclinations, that he\r\nproceeded so far as to mention the charge he had received, and thence\r\ndrew his demonstration, that Herod was not able to live without her; and\r\nthat if he should come to any ill end, he could not endure a separation\r\nfrom her, even after he was dead. Thus spake Joseph. But the women, as\r\nwas natural, did not take this to be an instance of Herod's strong\r\naffection for them, but of his severe usage of them, that they could not\r\nescape destruction, nor a tyrannical death, even when he was dead\r\nhimself. And this saying [of Joseph] was a foundation for the women's\r\nsevere suspicions about him afterwards.\r\n\r\n7. At this time a report went about the city Jerusalem among Herod's\r\nenemies, that Antony had tortured Herod, and put him to death. This\r\nreport, as is natural, disturbed those that were about the palace, but\r\nchiefly the women; upon which Alexandra endeavored to persuade Joseph to\r\ngo out of the palace, and fly away with them to the ensigns of the Roman\r\nlegion, which then lay encamped about the city, as a guard to the\r\nkingdom, under the command of Julius; for that by this means, if any\r\ndisturbance should happen about the palace, they should be in greater\r\nsecurity, as having the Romans favorable to them; and that besides, they\r\nhoped to obtain the highest authority, if Antony did but once see\r\nMariamne, by whose means they should recover the kingdom, and want\r\nnothing which was reasonable for them to hope for, because of their\r\nroyal extraction.\r\n\r\n8. But as they were in the midst of these deliberations, letters were\r\nbrought from Herod about all his affairs, and proved contrary to the\r\nreport, and of what they before expected; for when he was come to\r\nAntony, he soon recovered his interest with him, by the presents he made\r\nhim, which he had brought with him from Jerusalem; and he soon induced\r\nhim, upon discoursing with him, to leave off his indignation at him, so\r\nthat Cleopatra's persuasions had less force than the arguments and\r\npresents he brought to regain his friendship; for Antony said that it\r\nwas not good to require an account of a king, as to the affairs of his\r\ngovernment, for at this rate he could be no king at all, but that those\r\nwho had given him that authority ought to permit him to make use of it.\r\nHe also said the same things to Cleopatra, that it would be best for her\r\nnot busily to meddle with the acts of the king's government. Herod wrote\r\nan account of these things, and enlarged upon the other honors which he\r\nhad received from Antony; how he sat by him at his hearing causes, and\r\ntook his diet with him every day, and that he enjoyed those favors from\r\nhim, notwithstanding the reproaches that Cleopatra so severely laid\r\nagainst him, who having a great desire of his country, and earnestly\r\nentreating Antony that the kingdom might be given to her, labored with\r\nher utmost diligence to have him out of the way; but that he still found\r\nAntony just to him, and had no longer any apprehensions of hard\r\ntreatment from him; and that he was soon upon his return, with a firmer\r\nadditional assurance of his favor to him, in his reigning and managing\r\npublic affairs; and that there was no longer any hope for Cleopatra's\r\ncovetous temper, since Antony had given her Celesyria instead of what\r\nshe had desired; by which means he had at once pacified her, and got\r\nclear of the entreaties which she made him to have Judea bestowed upon\r\nher.\r\n\r\n9. When these letters were brought, the women left off their attempt for\r\nflying to the Romans, which they thought of while Herod was supposed to\r\nbe dead; yet was not that purpose of theirs a secret; but when the king\r\nhad conducted Antony on his way against the Partnians, he returned to\r\nJudea, when both his sister Salome and his mother informed him of\r\nAlexandra's intentions. Salome also added somewhat further against\r\nJoseph, though it was no more than a calumny, that he had often had\r\ncriminal conversation with Mariamne. The reason of her saying so was\r\nthis, that she for a long time bare her ill-will; for when they had\r\ndifferences with one another, Mariamne took great freedoms, and\r\nreproached the rest for the meanness of their birth. But Herod, whose\r\naffection to Mariamne was always very warm, was presently disturbed at\r\nthis, and could not bear the torments of jealousy, but was still\r\nrestrained from doing any rash thing to her by the love he had for her;\r\nyet did his vehement affection and jealousy together make him ask\r\nMariamne by herself about this matter of Joseph; but she denied it upon\r\nher oath, and said all that an innocent woman could possibly say in her\r\nown defense; so that by little and little the king was prevailed upon to\r\ndrop the suspicion, and left off his anger at her; and being overcome\r\nwith his passion for his wife, he made an apology to her for having\r\nseemed to believe what he had heard about her, and returned her a great\r\nmany acknowledgments of her modest behavior, and professed the\r\nextraordinary affection and kindness he had for her, till at last, as is\r\nusual between lovers, they both fell into tears, and embraced one\r\nanother with a most tender affection. But as the king gave more and more\r\nassurances of his belief of her fidelity, and endeavored to draw her to\r\na like confidence in him, Mariamne said, \"Yet was not that command thou\r\ngavest, that if any harm came to thee from Antony, I, who had been no\r\noccasion of it, should perish with thee, a sign of thy love to me?\" When\r\nthese words were fallen from her, the king was shocked at them, and\r\npresently let her go out of his arms, and cried out, and tore his hair\r\nwith his own hands, and said, that \"now he had an evident demonstration\r\nthat Joseph had had criminal conversation\" with his wife; for that he\r\nwould never have uttered what he had told him alone by himself, unless\r\nthere had been such a great familiarity and firm confidence between\r\nthem. And while he was in this passion he had like to have killed his\r\nwife; but being still overborne by his love to her, he restrained this\r\nhis passion, though not without a lasting grief and disquietness of\r\nmind. However, he gave order to slay Joseph, without permitting him to\r\ncome into his sight; and as for Alexandra, he bound her, and kept her in\r\ncustody, as the cause of all this mischief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How Cleopatra, When She Had Gotten From Antony Some Parts Of\r\nJudea And Arabia Came Into Judea; And How Herod Gave Her Many Presents\r\nAnd Conducted Her On Her Way Back To Egypt.\r\n\r\n1. Now at this time the affairs of Syria were in confusion by\r\nCleopatra's constant persuasions to Antony to make an attempt upon every\r\nbody's dominions; for she persuaded him to take those dominions away\r\nfrom their several princes, and bestow them upon her; and she had a\r\nmighty influence upon him, by reason of his being enslaved to her by his\r\naffections. She was also by nature very covetous, and stuck at no\r\nwickedness. She had already poisoned her brother, because she knew that\r\nhe was to be king of Egypt, and this when he was but fifteen years old;\r\nand she got her sister Arsinoe to be slain, by the means of Antony, when\r\nshe was a supplicant at Diana's temple at Ephesus; for if there were but\r\nany hopes of getting money, she would violate both temples and\r\nsepulchers. Nor was there any holy place that was esteemed the most\r\ninviolable, from which she would not fetch the ornaments it had in it;\r\nnor any place so profane, but was to suffer the most flagitious\r\ntreatment possible from her, if it could but contribute somewhat to the\r\ncovetous humor of this wicked creature: yet did not all this suffice so\r\nextravagant a woman, who was a slave to her lusts, but she still\r\nimagined that she wanted every thing she could think of, and did her\r\nutmost to gain it; for which reason she hurried Antony on perpetually to\r\ndeprive others of their dominions, and give them to her. And as she went\r\nover Syria with him, she contrived to get it into her possession; so he\r\nslew Lysanias, the son of Ptolemy, accusing him of his bringing the\r\nParthians upon those countries. She also petitioned Antony to give her\r\nJudea and Arabia; and, in order thereto, desired him to take these\r\ncountries away from their present governors. As for Antony, he was so\r\nentirely overcome by this woman, that one would not think her\r\nconversation only could do it, but that he was some way or other\r\nbewitched to do whatsoever she would have him; yet did the grossest\r\nparts of her injustice make him so ashamed, that he would not always\r\nhearken to her to do those flagrant enormities she would have persuaded\r\nhim to. That therefore he might not totally deny her, nor, by doing\r\nevery thing which she enjoined him, appear openly to be an ill man, he\r\ntook some parts of each of those countries away from their former\r\ngovernors, and gave them to her. Thus he gave her the cities that were\r\nwithin the river Eleutherus, as far as Egypt, excepting Tyre and Sidon,\r\nwhich he knew to have been free cities from their ancestors, although\r\nshe pressed him very often to bestow those on her also.\r\n\r\n2. When Cleopatra had obtained thus much, and had accompanied Antony in\r\nhis expedition to Armenia as far as Euphrates, she returned back, and\r\ncame to Apamia and Damascus, and passed on to Judea, where Herod met\r\nher, and farmed of her parts of Arabia, and those revenues that came to\r\nher from the region about Jericho. This country bears that balsam, which\r\nis the most precious drug that is there, and grows there alone. The\r\nplace bears also palm trees, both many in number, and those excellent in\r\ntheir kind. When she was there, and was very often with Herod, she\r\nendeavored to have criminal conversation with the king; nor did she\r\naffect secrecy in the indulgence of such sort of pleasures; and perhaps\r\nshe had in some measure a passion of love to him; or rather, what is\r\nmost probable, she laid a treacherous snare for him, by aiming to obtain\r\nsuch adulterous conversation from him: however, upon the whole, she\r\nseemed overcome with love to him. Now Herod had a great while borne no\r\ngood-will to Cleopatra, as knowing that she was a woman irksome to all;\r\nand at that time he thought her particularly worthy of his hatred, if\r\nthis attempt proceeded out of lust; he had also thought of preventing\r\nher intrigues, by putting her to death, if such were her endeavors.\r\nHowever, he refused to comply with her proposals, and called a counsel\r\nof his friends to consult with them whether he should not kill her, now\r\nhe had her in his power; for that he should thereby deliver all those\r\nfrom a multitude of evils to whom she was already become irksome, and\r\nwas expected to be still so for the time to come; and that this very\r\nthing would be much for the advantage of Antony himself, since she would\r\ncertainly not be faithful to him, in case any such season or necessity\r\nshould come upon him as that he should stand in need of her fidelity.\r\nBut when he thought to follow this advice, his friends would not let\r\nhim; and told him that, in the first place, it was not right to attempt\r\nso great a thing, and run himself thereby into the utmost danger; and\r\nthey laid hard at him, and begged of him to undertake nothing rashly,\r\nfor that Antony would never bear it, no, not though any one should\r\nevidently lay before his eyes that it was for his own advantage; and\r\nthat the appearance of depriving him of her conversation, by this\r\nviolent and treacherous method, would probably set his affections more\r\non a flame than before. Nor did it appear that he could offer any thing\r\nof tolerable weight in his defense, this attempt being against such a\r\nwoman as was of the highest dignity of any of her sex at that time in\r\nthe world; and as to any advantage to be expected from such an\r\nundertaking, if any such could be supposed in this case, it would appear\r\nto deserve condemnation, on account of the insolence he must take upon\r\nhim in doing it: which considerations made it very plain that in so\r\ndoing he would find his government filled with mischief, both great and\r\nlasting, both to himself and his posterity, whereas it was still in his\r\npower to reject that wickedness she would persuade him to, and to come\r\noff honorably at the same time. So by thus affrighting Herod, and\r\nrepresenting to him the hazard he must, in all probability, run by this\r\nundertaking, they restrained him from it. So he treated Cleopatra\r\nkindly, and made her presents, and conducted her on her way to Egypt.\r\n\r\n3. But Antony subdued Armenia, and sent Artabazes, the son of Tigranes,\r\nin bonds, with his children and procurators, to Egypt, and made a\r\npresent of them, and of all the royal ornaments which he had taken out\r\nof that kingdom, to Cleopatra. And Artaxias, the eldest of his sons, who\r\nhad escaped at that time, took the kingdom of Armenia; who yet was\r\nejected by Archelaus and Nero Cæsar, when they restored Tigranes, his\r\nyounger brother, to that kingdom; but this happened a good while\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\n4. But then, as to the tributes which Herod was to pay Cleopatra for\r\nthat country which Antony had given her, he acted fairly with her, as\r\ndeeming it not safe for him to afford any cause for Cleopatra to hate\r\nhim. As for the king of Arabia, whose tribute Herod had undertaken to\r\npay her, for some time indeed he paid him as much as came to two hundred\r\ntalents; but he afterwards became very niggardly and slow in his\r\npayments, and could hardly be brought to pay some parts of it, and was\r\nnot willing to pay even them without some deductions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How Herod Made War With The King Of Arabia, And After They\r\nHad Fought Many Battles, At Length Conquered Him, And Was Chosen By The\r\nArabs To Be Governor Of That Nation; As Also Concerning A Great\r\nEarthquake.\r\n\r\n1. Hereupon Herod held himself ready to go against the king of Arabia,\r\nbecause of his ingratitude to him, and because, after all, he would do\r\nnothing that was just to him, although Herod made the Roman war an\r\noccasion of delaying his own; for the battle at Actium was now expected,\r\nwhich fell into the hundred eighty and seventh olympiad, where Cæsar and\r\nAntony were to fight for the supreme power of the world; but Herod\r\nhaving enjoyed a country that was very fruitful, and that now for a long\r\ntime, and having received great taxes, and raised great armies\r\ntherewith, got together a body of men, and carefully furnished them with\r\nall necessaries, and designed them as auxiliaries for Antony. But Antony\r\nsaid he had no want of his assistance; but he commanded him to punish\r\nthe king of Arabia; for he had heard both from him, and from Cleopatra,\r\nhow perfidious he was; for this was what Cleopatra desired, who thought\r\nit for her own advantage that these two kings should do one another as\r\ngreat mischief as possible. Upon this message from Antony, Herod\r\nreturned back, but kept his army with him, in order to invade Arabia\r\nimmediately. So when his army of horsemen and footmen was ready, he\r\nmarched to Diospolis, whither the Arabians came also to meet them, for\r\nthey were not unapprized of this war that was coming upon them; and\r\nafter a great battle had been fought, the Jews had the victory. But\r\nafterward there were gotten together another numerous army of the\r\nArabians, at Cana, which is a place of Celesyria. Herod was informed of\r\nthis beforehand; so he came marching against them with the greatest part\r\nof the forces he had; and when he was come near to Cana, he resolved to\r\nencamp himself; and he cast up a bulwark, that he might take a proper\r\nseason for attacking the enemy; but as he was giving those orders, the\r\nmultitude of the Jews cried out that he should make no delay, but lead\r\nthem against the Arabians. They went with great spirit, as believing\r\nthey were in very good order; and those especially were so that had been\r\nin the former battle, and had been conquerors, and had not permitted\r\ntheir enemies so much as to come to a close fight with them. And when\r\nthey were so tumultuous, and showed such great alacrity, the king\r\nresolved to make use of that zeal the multitude then exhibited; and when\r\nhe had assured them he would not be behindhand with them in courage, he\r\nled them on, and stood before them all in his armor, all the regiments\r\nfollowing him in their several ranks: whereupon a consternation fell\r\nupon the Arabians; for when they perceived that the Jews were not to be\r\nconquered, and were full of spirit, the greater part of them ran away,\r\nand avoided fighting; and they had been quite destroyed, had not Anthony\r\nfallen upon the Jews, and distressed them; for this man was Cleopatra's\r\ngeneral over the soldiers she had there, and was at enmity with Herod,\r\nand very wistfully looked on to see what the event of the battle would\r\nbe. He had also resolved, that in case the Arabians did any thing that\r\nwas brave and successful, he would lie still; but in case they were\r\nbeaten, as it really happened, he would attack the Jews with those\r\nforces he had of his own, and with those that the country had gotten\r\ntogether for him. So he fell upon the Jews unexpectedly, when they were\r\nfatigued, and thought they had already vanquished the enemy, and made a\r\ngreat slaughter of them; for as the Jews had spent their courage upon\r\ntheir known enemies, and were about to enjoy themselves in quietness\r\nafter their victory, they were easily beaten by these that attacked them\r\nafresh, and in particular received a great loss in places where the\r\nhorses could not be of service, and which were very stony, and where\r\nthose that attacked them were better acquainted with the places than\r\nthemselves. And when the Jews had suffered this loss, the Arabians\r\nraised their spirits after their defeat, and returning back again, slew\r\nthose that were already put to flight; and indeed all sorts of slaughter\r\nwere now frequent, and of those that escaped, a few only returned into\r\nthe camp. So king Herod, when he despaired of the battle, rode up to\r\nthem to bring them assistance; yet did he not come time enough to do\r\nthem any service, though he labored hard to do it; but the Jewish camp\r\nwas taken; so that the Arabians had unexpectedly a most glorious\r\nsuccess, having gained that victory which of themselves they were no way\r\nlikely to have gained, and slaying a great part of the enemy's army:\r\nwhence afterward Herod could only act like a private robber, and make\r\nexcursions upon many parts of Arabia, and distress them by sudden\r\nincursions, while he encamped among the mountains, and avoided by any\r\nmeans to come to a pitched battle; yet did he greatly harass the enemy\r\nby his assiduity, and the hard labor he took in this matter. He also\r\ntook great care of his own forces, and used all the means he could to\r\nrestore his affairs to their old state.\r\n\r\n2. At this time it was that the fight happened at Actium, between\r\nOctavius Cæsar and Antony, in the seventh year of the reign of Herod 8\r\nand then it was also that there was an earthquake in Judea, such a one\r\nas had not happened at any other time, and which earthquake brought a\r\ngreat destruction upon the cattle in that country. About ten thousand\r\nmen also perished by the fall of houses; but the army, which lodged in\r\nthe field, received no damage by this sad accident. When the Arabians\r\nwere informed of this, and when those that hated the Jews, and pleased\r\nthemselves with aggravating the reports, told them of it, they raised\r\ntheir spirits, as if their enemy's country was quite overthrown, and the\r\nmen were utterly destroyed, and thought there now remained nothing that\r\ncould oppose them. Accordingly, they took the Jewish ambassadors, who\r\ncame to them after all this had happened, to make peace with them, and\r\nslew them, and came with great alacrity against their army; but the Jews\r\ndurst not withstand them, and were so cast down by the calamities they\r\nwere under, that they took no care of their affairs, but gave up\r\nthemselves to despair; for they had no hope that they should be upon a\r\nlevel again with them in battles, nor obtain any assistance elsewhere,\r\nwhile their affairs at home were in such great distress also. When\r\nmatters were in this condition, the king persuaded the commanders by his\r\nwords, and tried to raise their spirits, which were quite sunk; and\r\nfirst he endeavored to encourage and embolden some of the better sort\r\nbeforehand, and then ventured to make a speech to the multitude, which\r\nhe had before avoided to do, lest he should find them uneasy thereat,\r\nbecause of the misfortunes which had happened; so he made a consolatory\r\nspeech to the multitude, in the manner following:\r\n\r\n3. \"You are not unacquainted, my fellow soldiers, that we have had, not\r\nlong since, many accidents that have put a stop to what we are about,\r\nand it is probable that even those that are most distinguished above\r\nothers for their courage can hardly keep up their spirits in such\r\ncircumstances; but since we cannot avoid fighting, and nothing that hath\r\nhappened is of such a nature but it may by ourselves be recovered into a\r\ngood state, and this by one brave action only well performed, I have\r\nproposed to myself both to give you some encouragement, and, at the same\r\ntime, some information; both which parts of my design will tend to this\r\npoint; that you may still continue in your own proper fortitude. I will\r\nthen, in the first place, demonstrate to you that this war is a just one\r\non our side, and that on this account it is a war of necessity, and\r\noccasioned by the injustice of our adversaries; for if you be once\r\nsatisfied of this, it will be a real cause of alacrity to you; after\r\nwhich I will further demonstrate, that the misfortunes we are under are\r\nof no great consequence, and that we have the greatest reason to hope\r\nfor victory. I shall begin with the first, and appeal to yourselves as\r\nwitnesses to what I shall say. You are not ignorant certainly of the\r\nwickedness of the Arabians, which is to that degree as to appear\r\nincredible to all other men, and to include somewhat that shows the\r\ngrossest barbarity and ignorance of God. The chief things wherein they\r\nhave affronted us have arisen from covetousness and envy; and they have\r\nattacked us in an insidious manner, and on the sudden. And what occasion\r\nis there for me to mention many instances of such their procedure? When\r\nthey were in danger of losing their own government of themselves, and of\r\nbeing slaves to Cleopatra, what others were they that freed them from\r\nthat fear? for it was the friendship I had with Antony, and the kind\r\ndisposition he was in towards us, that hath been the occasion that even\r\nthese Arabians have not been utterly undone, Antony being unwilling to\r\nundertake any thing which might be suspected by us of unkindness: but\r\nwhen he had a mind to bestow some parts of each of our dominions on\r\nCleopatra, I also managed that matter so, that by giving him presents of\r\nmy own, I might obtain a security to both nations, while I undertook\r\nmyself to answer for the money, and gave him two hundred talents, and\r\nbecame surety for those two hundred more which were imposed upon the\r\nland that was subject to this tribute; and this they have defrauded us\r\nof, although it was not reasonable that Jews should pay tribute to any\r\nman living, or allow part of their land to be taxable; but although that\r\nwas to be, yet ought we not to pay tribute for these Arabians, whom we\r\nhave ourselves preserved; nor is it fit that they, who have professed\r\n[and that with great integrity and sense of our kindness] that it is by\r\nour means that they keep their principality, should injure us, and\r\ndeprive us of what is our due, and this while we have been still not\r\ntheir enemies, but their friends. And whereas observation of covenants\r\ntakes place among the bitterest enemies, but among friends is absolutely\r\nnecessary, this is not observed among these men, who think gain to be\r\nthe best of all things, let it be by any means whatsoever, and that\r\ninjustice is no harm, if they may but get money by it: is it therefore a\r\nquestion with you, whether the unjust are to be punished or not? when\r\nGod himself hath declared his mind that so it ought to be, and hath\r\ncommanded that we ever should hate injuries and injustice, which is not\r\nonly just, but necessary, in wars between several nations; for these\r\nArabians have done what both the Greeks and barbarians own to be an\r\ninstance of the grossest wickedness, with regard to our ambassadors,\r\nwhich they have beheaded, while the Greeks declare that such ambassadors\r\nare sacred and inviolable. 9 And for ourselves, we have learned from God\r\nthe most excellent of our doctrines, and the most holy part of our law,\r\nby angels or ambassadors; for this name brings God to the knowledge of\r\nmankind, and is sufficient to reconcile enemies one to another. What\r\nwickedness then can be greater than the slaughter of ambassadors, who\r\ncome to treat about doing what is right? And when such have been their\r\nactions, how is it possible they can either live securely in common\r\nlife, or be successful in war? In my opinion, this is impossible; but\r\nperhaps some will say, that what is holy, and what is righteous, is\r\nindeed on our side, but that the Arabians are either more courageous or\r\nmore numerous than we are. Now, as to this, in the first place, it is\r\nnot fit for us to say so, for with whom is what is righteous, with them\r\nis God himself; now where God is, there is both multitude and courage.\r\nBut to examine our own circumstances a little, we were conquerors in the\r\nfirst battle; and when we fought again, they were not able to oppose us,\r\nbut ran away, and could not endure our attacks or our courage; but when\r\nwe had conquered them, then came Athenion, and made war against us\r\nwithout declaring it; and pray, is this an instance of their manhood? or\r\nis it not a second instance of their wickedness and treachery? Why are\r\nwe therefore of less courage, on account of that which ought to inspire\r\nus with stronger hopes? and why are we terrified at these, who, when\r\nthey fight upon the level, are continually beaten, and when they seem to\r\nbe conquerors, they gain it by wickedness? and if we suppose that any\r\none should deem them to be men of real courage, will not he be excited\r\nby that very consideration to do his utmost against them? for true valor\r\nis not shown by fighting against weak persons, but in being able to\r\novercome the most hardy. But then if the distresses we are ourselves\r\nunder, and the miseries that have come by the earthquake, hath\r\naffrighted any one, let him consider, in the first place, that this very\r\nthing will deceive the Arabians, by their supposal that what hath\r\nbefallen us is greater than it really is. Moreover, it is not right that\r\nthe same thing that emboldens them should discourage us; for these men,\r\nyou see, do not derive their alacrity from any advantageous virtue of\r\ntheir own, but from their hope, as to us, that we are quite cast down by\r\nour misfortunes; but when we boldly march against them, we shall soon\r\npull down their insolent conceit of themselves, and shall gain this by\r\nattacking them, that they will not be so insolent when we come to the\r\nbattle; for our distresses are not so great, nor is what hath happened\r\nall indication of the anger of God against us, as some imagine; for such\r\nthings are accidental, and adversities that come in the usual course of\r\nthings; and if we allow that this was done by the will of God, we must\r\nallow that it is now over by his will also, and that he is satisfied\r\nwith what hath already happened; for had he been willing to afflict us\r\nstill more thereby, he had not changed his mind so soon. And as for the\r\nwar we are engaged in, he hath himself demonstrated that he is willing\r\nit should go on, and that he knows it to be a just war; for while some\r\nof the people in the country have perished, all you who were in arms\r\nhave suffered nothing, but are all preserved alive; whereby God makes it\r\nplain to us, that if you had universally, with your children and wives,\r\nbeen in the army, it had come to pass that you had not undergone any\r\nthing that would have much hurt you. Consider these things, and, what is\r\nmore than all the rest, that you have God at all times for your\r\nProtector; and prosecute these men with a just bravery, who, in point of\r\nfriendship, are unjust, in their battles perfidious, towards ambassadors\r\nimpious, and always inferior to you in valor.\"\r\n\r\n4. When the Jews heard this speech, they were much raised in their\r\nminds, and more disposed to fight than before. So Herod, when he had\r\noffered the sacrifices appointed by the law 10 made haste, and took\r\nthem, and led them against the Arabians; and in order to that passed\r\nover Jordan, and pitched his camp near to that of the enemy. He also\r\nthought fit to seize upon a certain castle that lay in the midst of\r\nthem, as hoping it would be for his advantage, and would the sooner\r\nproduce a battle; and that if there were occasion for delay, he should\r\nby it have his camp fortified; and as the Arabians had the same\r\nintentions upon that place, a contest arose about it; at first they were\r\nbut skirmishes, after which there came more soldiers, and it proved a\r\nsort of fight, and some fell on both sides, till those of the Arabian\r\nside were beaten and retreated. This was no small encouragement to the\r\nJews immediately; and when Herod observed that the enemy's army was\r\ndisposed to any thing rather than to come to an engagement, he ventured\r\nboldly to attempt the bulwark itself, and to pull it to pieces, and so\r\nto get nearer to their camp, in order to fight them; for when they were\r\nforced out of their trenches, they went out in disorder, and had not the\r\nleast alacrity, or hope of victory; yet did they fight hand to hand,\r\nbecause they were more in number than the Jews, and because they were in\r\nsuch a disposition of war that they were under a necessity of coming on\r\nboldly; so they came to a terrible battle, while not a few fell on each\r\nside. However, at length the Arabians fled; and so great a slaughter was\r\nmade upon their being routed, that they were not only killed by their\r\nenemies, but became the authors of their own deaths also, and were\r\ntrodden down by the multitude, and the great current of people in\r\ndisorder, and were destroyed by their own armor; so five thousand men\r\nlay dead upon the spot, while the rest of the multitude soon ran within\r\nthe bulwark for safety, but had no firm hope of safety, by reason of\r\ntheir want of necessaries, and especially of water. The Jews pursued\r\nthem, but could not get in with them, but sat round about the bulwark,\r\nand watched any assistance that would get in to them, and prevented any\r\nthere, that had a mind to it, from running away.\r\n\r\n5. When the Arabians were in these circumstances, they sent ambassadors\r\nto Herod, in the first place, to propose terms of accommodation, and\r\nafter that to offer him, so pressing was their thirst upon them, to\r\nundergo whatsoever he pleased, if he would free them from their present\r\ndistress; but he would admit of no ambassadors, of no price of\r\nredemption, nor of any other moderate terms whatever, being very\r\ndesirous to revenge those unjust actions which they had been guilty of\r\ntowards his nation. So they were necessitated by other motives, and\r\nparticularly by their thirst, to come out, and deliver themselves up to\r\nhim, to be carried away captives; and in five days' time the number of\r\nfour thousand were taken prisoners, while all the rest resolved to make\r\na sally upon their enemies, and to fight it out with them, choosing\r\nrather, if so it must be, to die therein, than to perish gradually and\r\ningloriously. When they had taken this resolution, they came out of\r\ntheir trenches, but could no way sustain the fight, being too much\r\ndisabled, both in mind and body, and having not room to exert\r\nthemselves, and thought it an advantage to be killed, and a misery to\r\nsurvive; so at the first onset there fell about seven thousand of them,\r\nafter which stroke they let all the courage they had put on before fall,\r\nand stood amazed at Herod's warlike spirit under his own calamities; so\r\nfor the future they yielded, and made him ruler of their nation;\r\nwhereupon he was greatly elevated at so seasonable a success, and\r\nreturned home, taking great authority upon him, on account of so bold\r\nand glorious an expedition as he had made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How Herod Slew Hyrcanus And Then Hasted Away To Cæsar, And\r\nObtained The Kingdom From Him Also; And How A Little Time Afterward, He\r\nEntertained Cæsar In A Most Honorable Manner.\r\n\r\n1. Herod's other affairs were now very prosperous, and he was not to be\r\neasily assaulted on any side. Yet did there come upon him a danger that\r\nwould hazard his entire dominions, after Antony had been beaten at the\r\nbattle of Actium by Cæsar [Octavian]; for at that time both Herod's\r\nenemies and friends despaired of his affairs, for it was not probable\r\nthat he would remain without punishment, who had showed so much\r\nfriendship for Antony. So it happened that his friends despaired, and\r\nhad no hopes of his escape; but for his enemies, they all outwardly\r\nappeared to be troubled at his case, but were privately very glad of it,\r\nas hoping to obtain a change for the better. As for Herod himself he saw\r\nthat there was no one of royal dignity left but Hyrcanus, and therefore\r\nhe thought it would be for his advantage not to suffer him to be an\r\nobstacle in his way any longer; for that in case he himself survived,\r\nand escaped the danger he was in, he thought it the safest way to put it\r\nout of the power of such a man to make any attempt against him, at such\r\njunctures of affairs, as was more worthy of the kingdom than himself;\r\nand in case he should be slain by Cæsar, his envy prompted him to desire\r\nto slay him that would otherwise be king after him.\r\n\r\n2. While Herod had these things in his mind, there was a certain\r\noccasion afforded him: for Hyrcanus was of so mild a temper, both then\r\nand at other times, that he desired not to meddle with public affairs,\r\nnor to concern himself with innovations, but left all to fortune, and\r\ncontented himself with what that afforded him: but Alexandra [his\r\ndaughter] was a lover of strife, and was exceeding desirous of a change\r\nof the government, and spake to her father not to bear for ever Herod's\r\ninjurious treatment of their family, but to anticipate their future\r\nhopes, as he safely might; and desired him to write about these matters\r\nto Malchus, who was then governor of Arabia, to receive them, and to\r\nsecure them [from Herod], for that if they went away, and Herod's\r\naffairs proved to be as it was likely they would be, by reason of\r\nCæsar's enmity to him, they should then be the only persons that could\r\ntake the government; and this, both on account of the royal family they\r\nwere of, and on account of the good disposition of: the multitude to\r\nthem. While she used these persuasions, Hyrcanus put off her suit; but\r\nas she showed that she was a woman, and a contentious woman too, and\r\nwould not desist either night or day, but would always be speaking to\r\nhim about these matters, and about Herod's treacherous designs, she at\r\nlast prevailed with him to intrust Dositheus, one of his friends, with a\r\nletter, wherein his resolution was declared; and he desired the Arabian\r\ngovernor to send to him some horsemen, who should receive him, and\r\nconduct him to the lake Asphaltites, which is from the bounds of\r\nJerusalem three hundred furlongs: and he did therefore trust Dositheus\r\nwith this letter, because he was a careful attendant on him, and on\r\nAlexandra, and had no small occasions to bear ill-will to Herod; for he\r\nwas a kinsman of one Joseph, whom he had slain, and a brother of those\r\nthat were formerly slain at Tyre by Antony: yet could not these motives\r\ninduce Dositheus to serve Hyrcanus in this affair; for, preferring the\r\nhopes he had from the present king to those he had from him, he gave\r\nHerod the letter. So he took his kindness in good part, and bid him\r\nbesides do what he had already done, that is, go on in serving him, by\r\nrolling up the epistle and sealing it again, and delivering it to\r\nMalchus, and then to bring back his letter in answer to it; for it would\r\nbe much better if he could know Malchus's intentions also. And when\r\nDositheus was very ready to serve him in this point also, the Arabian\r\ngovernor returned back for answer, that he would receive Hyrcanus, and\r\nall that should come with him, and even all the Jews that were of his\r\nparty; that he would, moreover, send forces sufficient to secure them in\r\ntheir journey; and that he should be in no want of any thing he should\r\ndesire. Now as soon as Herod had received this letter, he immediately\r\nsent for Hyrcanus, and questioned him about the league he had made with\r\nMalchus; and when he denied it, he showed his letter to the Sanhedrim,\r\nand put the man to death immediately.\r\n\r\n3. And this account we give the reader, as it is contained in the\r\ncommentaries of king Herod: but other historians do not agree with them,\r\nfor they suppose that Herod did not find, but rather make, this an\r\noccasion for thus putting him to death, and that by treacherously laying\r\na snare for him; for thus do they write: That Herod and he were once at\r\na treat, and that Herod had given no occasion to suspect [that he was\r\ndispleased at him], but put this question to Hyrcanus, Whether he had\r\nreceived any letters from Malchus? and when he answered that he had\r\nreceived letters, but those of salutation only; and when he asked\r\nfurther, whether he had not received any presents from him? and when he\r\nhad replied that he had received no more than four horses to ride on,\r\nwhich Malchus had sent him; they pretended that Herod charged these upon\r\nhim as the crimes of bribery and treason, and gave order that he should\r\nbe led away and slain. And in order to demonstrate that he had been\r\nguilty of no offense, when he was thus brought to his end, they alleged\r\nhow mild his temper had been, and that even in his youth he had never\r\ngiven any demonstration of boldness or rashness, and that the case was\r\nthe same when he came to be king, but that he even then committed the\r\nmanagement of the greatest part of public affairs to Antipater; and that\r\nhe was now above fourscore years old, and knew that Herod's government\r\nwas in a secure state. He also came over Euphrates, and left those who\r\ngreatly honored him beyond that river, though he were to be entirely\r\nunder Herod's government; and that it was a most incredible thing that\r\nhe should enterprise any thing by way of innovation, and not at all\r\nagreeable to his temper, but that this was a plot of Herod's\r\ncontrivance.\r\n\r\n4. And this was the fate of Hyrcanus; and thus did he end his life,\r\nafter he had endured various and manifold turns of fortune in his\r\nlifetime. For he was made high priest of the Jewish nation in the\r\nbeginning of his mother Alexandra's reign, who held the government nine\r\nyears; and when, after his mother's death, he took the kingdom himself,\r\nand held it three months, he lost it, by the means of his brother\r\nAristobulus. He was then restored by Pompey, and received all sorts of\r\nhonor from him, and enjoyed them forty years; but when he was again\r\ndeprived by Antigonus, and was maimed in his body, he was made a captive\r\nby the Parthians, and thence returned home again after some time, on\r\naccount of the hopes that Herod had given him; none of which came to\r\npass according to his expectation, but he still conflicted with many\r\nmisfortunes through the whole course of his life; and, what was the\r\nheaviest calamity of all, as we have related already, he came to an end\r\nwhich was undeserved by him. His character appeared to be that of a man\r\nof a mild and moderate disposition, and suffered the administration of\r\naffairs to be generally done by others under him. He was averse to much\r\nmeddling with the public, nor had shrewdness enough to govern a kingdom.\r\nAnd both Antipater and Herod came to their greatness by reason of his\r\nmildness; and at last he met with such an end from them as was not\r\nagreeable either to justice or piety.\r\n\r\n5. Now Herod, as soon as he had put Hyrcanus out of the way, made haste\r\nto Cæsar; and because he could not have any hopes of kindness from him,\r\non account of the friendship he had for Antony, he had a suspicion of\r\nAlexandra, lest she should take this opportunity to bring the multitude\r\nto a revolt, and introduce a sedition into the affairs of the kingdom;\r\nso he committed the care of every thing to his brother Pheroras, and\r\nplaced his mother Cypros, and his sister [Salome], and the whole family\r\nat Masada, and gave him a charge, that if he should hear any sad news\r\nabout him, he should take care of the government. But as to Mariamne his\r\nwife, because of the misunderstanding between her and his sister, and\r\nhis sister's mother, which made it impossible for them to live together,\r\nhe placed her at Alexandrium, with Alexandra her mother, and left his\r\ntreasurer Joseph and Sohemus of Iturea to take care of that fortress.\r\nThese two had been very faithful to him from the beginning, and were now\r\nleft as a guard to the women. They also had it in charge, that if they\r\nshould hear any mischief had befallen him, they should kill them both,\r\nand, as far as they were able, to preserve the kingdom for his sons, and\r\nfor his brother Pheroras.\r\n\r\n6. When he had given them this charge, he made haste to Rhodes, to meet\r\nCæsar; and when he had sailed to that city, he took off his diadem, but\r\nremitted nothing else of his usual dignity. And when, upon his meeting\r\nhim, he desired that he would let him speak to him, he therein exhibited\r\na much more noble specimen of a great soul; for he did not betake\r\nhimself to supplications, as men usually do upon such occasions, nor\r\noffered him any petition, as if he were an offender; but, after an\r\nundaunted manner, gave an account of what he had done; for he spake thus\r\nto Cæsar: That he had the greatest friendship for Antony, and did every\r\nthing he could that he might attain the government; that he was not\r\nindeed in the army with him, because the Arabians had diverted him; but\r\nthat he had sent him both money and corn, which was but too little in\r\ncomparison of what he ought to have done for him; \"for if a man owns\r\nhimself to be another's friend, and knows him to be a benefactor, he is\r\nobliged to hazard every thing, to use every faculty of his soul, every\r\nmember of his body, and all the wealth he hath, for him, in which I\r\nconfess I have been too deficient. However, I am conscious to myself,\r\nthat so far I have done right, that I have not deserted him upon his\r\ndefeat at Actium; nor upon the evident change of his fortune have I\r\ntransferred my hopes from him to another, but have preserved myself,\r\nthough not as a valuable fellow soldier, yet certainly as a faithful\r\ncounselor, to Antony, when I demonstrated to him that the only way that\r\nhe had to save himself, and not to lose all his authority, was to slay\r\nCleopatra; for when she was once dead, there would be room for him to\r\nretain his authority, and rather to bring thee to make a composition\r\nwith him, than to continue at enmity any longer. None of which advises\r\nwould he attend to, but preferred his own rash resolution before them,\r\nwhich have happened unprofitably for him, but profitably for thee. Now,\r\ntherefore, in case thou determinest about me, and my alacrity in serving\r\nAntony, according to thy anger at him, I own there is no room for me to\r\ndeny what I have done, nor will I be ashamed to own, and that publicly\r\ntoo, that I had a great kindness for him. But if thou wilt put him out\r\nof the case, and only examine how I behave myself to my benefactors in\r\ngeneral, and what sort of friend I am, thou wilt find by experience that\r\nwe shall do and be the same to thyself, for it is but changing the\r\nnames, and the firmness of friendship that we shall bear to thee will\r\nnot be disapproved by thee.\"\r\n\r\n7. By this speech, and by his behavior, which showed Cæsar the frankness\r\nof his mind, he greatly gained upon him, who was himself of a generous\r\nand magnificent temper, insomuch that those very actions, which were the\r\nfoundation of the accusation against him, procured him Cæsar's good-\r\nwill. Accordingly, he restored him his diadem again; and encouraged him\r\nto exhibit himself as great a friend to himself as he had been to\r\nAntony, and then had him in great esteem. Moreover, he added this, that\r\nQuintus Didius had written to him that Herod had very readily assisted\r\nhim in the affair of the gladiators. So when he had obtained such a kind\r\nreception, and had, beyond all his hopes, procured his crown to be more\r\nentirely and firmly settled upon him than ever by Cæsar's donation, as\r\nwell as by that decree of the Romans, which Cæsar took care to procure\r\nfor his greater security, he conducted Cæsar on his way to Egypt, and\r\nmade presents, even beyond his ability, to both him and his friends, and\r\nin general behaved himself with great magnanimity. He also desired that\r\nCæsar would not put to death one Alexander, who had been a companion of\r\nAntony; but Cæsar had sworn to put him to death, and so he could not\r\nobtain that his petition. And now he returned to Judea again with\r\ngreater honor and assurance than ever, and affrighted those that had\r\nexpectations to the contrary, as still acquiring from his very dangers\r\ngreater splendor than before, by the favor of God to him. So he prepared\r\nfor the reception of Cæsar, as he was going out of Syria to invade\r\nEgypt; and when he came, he entertained him at Ptolemais with all royal\r\nmagnificence. He also bestowed presents on the army, and brought them\r\nprovisions in abundance. He also proved to be one of Cæsar's most\r\ncordial friends, and put the army in array, and rode along with Cæsar,\r\nand had a hundred and fifty men, well appointed in all respects, after a\r\nrich and sumptuous manner, for the better reception of him and his\r\nfriends. He also provided them with what they should want, as they\r\npassed over the dry desert, insomuch that they lacked neither wine nor\r\nwater, which last the soldiers stood in the greatest need of; and\r\nbesides, he presented Cæsar with eight hundred talents, and procured to\r\nhimself the good-will of them all, because he was assisting to them in a\r\nmuch greater and more splendid degree than the kingdom he had obtained\r\ncould afford; by which means he more and more demonstrated to Cæsar the\r\nfirmness of his friendship, and his readiness to assist him; and what\r\nwas of the greatest advantage to him was this, that his liberality came\r\nat a seasonable time also. And when they returned again out of Egypt,\r\nhis assistances were no way inferior to the good offices he had formerly\r\ndone them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How Herod Slew Sohemus And Mariamne And Afterward Alexandra\r\nAnd Costobarus, And His Most Intimate Friends, And At Last The Sons Of\r\nBabbas Also.\r\n\r\n1. However, when he came into his kingdom again, he found his house all\r\nin disorder, and his wife Mariamne and her mother Alexandra very uneasy;\r\nfor as they supposed [what was easy to be supposed] that they were not\r\nput into that fortress [Alexandrium] for the security of their persons,\r\nbut as into a garrison for their imprisonment, and that they had no\r\npower over any thing, either of others or of their own affairs, they\r\nwere very uneasy; and Mariamne supposing that the king's love to her was\r\nbut hypocritical, and rather pretended [as advantageous to himself] than\r\nreal, she looked upon it as fallacious. She also was grieved that he\r\nwould not allow her any hopes of surviving him, if he should come to any\r\nharm himself. She also recollected what commands he had formerly given\r\nto Joseph, insomuch that she endeavored to please her keepers, and\r\nespecially Sohemus, as well apprized how all was in his power. And at\r\nthe first Sohemus was faithful to Herod, and neglected none of the\r\nthings he had given him in charge; but when the women, by kind words and\r\nliberal presents, had gained his affections over to them, he was by\r\ndegrees overcome, and at length discovered to them all the king's\r\ninjunctions, and this on that account principally, that he did not so\r\nmuch as hope he would come back with the same authority he had before;\r\nso that he thought he should both escape any danger from him, and\r\nsupposed that he did hereby much gratify the women, who were likely not\r\nto be overlooked in the settling of the government; nay, that they would\r\nbe able to make him abundant recompense, since they must either reign\r\nthemselves, or be very near to him that should reign. He had a further\r\nground of hope also, that though Herod should have all the success he\r\ncould wish for, and should return again, he could not contradict his\r\nwife in what she desired, for he knew that the king's fondness for his\r\nwife was inexpressible. These were the motives that drew Sohemus to\r\ndiscover what injunctions had been given him. So Mariamne was greatly\r\ndispleased to hear that there was no end of the dangers she was under\r\nfrom Herod, and was greatly uneasy at it, and wished that he might\r\nobtain no favors [from Cæsar], and esteemed it almost an insupportable\r\ntask to live with him any longer; and this she afterward openly\r\ndeclared, without concealing her resentment.\r\n\r\n2. And now Herod sailed home with joy, at the unexpected good success he\r\nhad had; and went first of all, as was proper, to this his wife, and\r\ntold her, and her only, the good news, as preferring her before the\r\nrest, on account of his fondness for her, and the intimacy there had\r\nbeen between them, and saluted her; but so it happened, that as he told\r\nher of the good success he had had, she was so far from rejoicing at it,\r\nthat she rather was sorry for it; nor was she able to conceal her\r\nresentments, but, depending on her dignity, and the nobility of her\r\nbirth, in return for his salutations, she gave a groan, and declared\r\nevidently that she rather grieved than rejoiced at his success, and this\r\ntill Herod was disturbed at her, as affording him, not only marks of her\r\nsuspicion, but evident signs of her dissatisfaction. This much troubled\r\nhim, to see that this surprising hatred of his wife to him was not\r\nconcealed, but open; and he took this so ill, and yet was so unable to\r\nbear it, on account of the fondness he had for her, that he could not\r\ncontinue long in any one mind, but sometimes was angry at her, and\r\nsometimes reconciled himself to her; but by always changing one passion\r\nfor another, he was still in great uncertainty, and thus was he\r\nentangled between hatred and love, and was frequently disposed to\r\ninflict punishment on her for her insolence towards him; but being\r\ndeeply in love with her in his soul, he was not able to get quit of this\r\nwoman. In short, as he would gladly have her punished, so was he afraid\r\nlest, ere he were aware, he should, by putting her to death, bring a\r\nheavier punishment upon himself at the same time.\r\n\r\n3. When Herod's sister and mother perceived that he was in this temper\r\nwith regard to Mariamne they thought they had now got an excellent\r\nopportunity to exercise their hatred against her and provoked Herod to\r\nwrath by telling him, such long stories and calumnies about her, as\r\nmight at once excite his hatred and his jealousy. Now, though he\r\nwillingly enough heard their words, yet had not he courage enough to do\r\nany thing to her as if he believed them; but still he became worse and\r\nworse disposed to her, and these ill passions were more and more\r\ninflamed on both sides, while she did not hide her disposition towards\r\nhim, and he turned his love to her into wrath against her. But when he\r\nwas just going to put this matter past all remedy, he heard the news\r\nthat Cæsar was the victor in the war, and that Antony and Cleopatra were\r\nboth dead, and that he had conquered Egypt; whereupon he made haste to\r\ngo to meet Cæsar, and left the affairs of his family in their present\r\nstate. However, Mariamne recommended Sohemus to him, as he was setting\r\nout on his journey, and professed that she owed him thanks for the care\r\nhe had taken of her, and asked of the king for him a place in the\r\ngovernment; upon which an honorable employment was bestowed upon him\r\naccordingly. Now when Herod was come into Egypt, he was introduced to\r\nCæsar with great freedom, as already a friend of his, and received very\r\ngreat favors from him; for he made him a present of those four hundred\r\nGalatians who had been Cleopatra's guards, and restored that country to\r\nhim again, which, by her means, had been taken away from him. He also\r\nadded to his kingdom Gadara, Hippos, and Samaria; and, besides those,\r\nthe maritime cities, Gaza, and Anthedon, and Joppa, and Strato's Tower.\r\n\r\n4. Upon these new acquisitions, he grew more magnificent, and conducted\r\nCæsar as far as Antioch; but upon his return, as much as his prosperity\r\nwas augmented by the foreign additions that had been made him, so much\r\nthe greater were the distresses that came upon him in his own family,\r\nand chiefly in the affair of his wife, wherein he formerly appeared to\r\nhave been most of all fortunate; for the affection he had for Mariamne\r\nwas no way inferior to the affections of such as are on that account\r\ncelebrated in history, and this very justly. As for her, she was in\r\nother respects a chaste woman, and faithful to him; yet had she somewhat\r\nof a woman rough by nature, and treated her husband imperiously enough,\r\nbecause she saw he was so fond of her as to be enslaved to her. She did\r\nnot also consider seasonably with herself that she lived under a\r\nmonarchy, and that she was at another's disposal, and accordingly would\r\nbehave herself after a saucy manner to him, which yet he usually put off\r\nin a jesting way, and bore with moderation and good temper. She would\r\nalso expose his mother and his sister openly, on account of the meanness\r\nof their birth, and would speak unkindly of them, insomuch that there\r\nwas before this a disagreement and unpardonable hatred among the women,\r\nand it was now come to greater reproaches of one another than formerly,\r\nwhich suspicions increased, and lasted a whole year after Herod returned\r\nfrom Cæsar. However, these misfortunes, which had been kept under some\r\ndecency for a great while, burst out all at once upon such an occasion\r\nas was now offered; for as the king was one day about noon lain down on\r\nhis bed to rest him, he called for Mariamne, out of the great affection\r\nhe had always for her. She came in accordingly, but would not lie down\r\nby him; and when he was very desirous of her company, she showed her\r\ncontempt of him; and added, by way of reproach, that he had caused her\r\nfather and her brother to be slain. 11 And when he took this injury very\r\nunkindly, and was ready to use violence to her, in a precipitate manner,\r\nthe king's sister Salome, observing that he was more than ordinarily\r\ndisturbed, sent in to the king his cup-bearer, who had been prepared\r\nlong beforehand for such a design, and bid him tell the king how\r\nMariamne had persuaded him to give his assistance in preparing a love\r\npotion for him; and if he appeared to be greatly concerned, and to ask\r\nwhat that love potion was, to tell him that she had the potion, and that\r\nhe was desired only to give it him; but that in case he did not appear\r\nto be much concerned at this potion, to let the thing drop; and that if\r\nhe did so, no harm should thereby come to him. When she had given him\r\nthese instructions, she sent him in at this time to make such a speech.\r\nSo he went in, after a composed manner, to gain credit to what he should\r\nsay, and yet somewhat hastily, and said that Mariamne had given him\r\npresents, and persuaded him to give him a love potion. And when this\r\nmoved the king, he said that this love potion was a composition that she\r\nhad given him, whose effects he did not know, which was the reason of\r\nhis resolving to give him this information, as the safest course he\r\ncould take, both for himself and for the king. When Herod heard what he\r\nsaid, and was in an ill disposition before, his indignation grew more\r\nviolent; and he ordered that eunuch of Mariamne, who was most faithful\r\nto her, to be brought to torture about this potion, as well knowing it\r\nwas not possible that any thing small or great could be done without\r\nhim. And when the man was under the utmost agonies, he could say nothing\r\nconcerning the thing he was tortured about, but so far he knew, that\r\nMariamne's hatred against him was occasioned by somewhat that Sohemus\r\nhad said to her. Now as he was saying this, Herod cried out aloud, and\r\nsaid that Sohemus, who had been at all other times most faithful to him,\r\nand to his government, would not have betrayed what injunctions he had\r\ngiven him, unless he had had a nearer conversation than ordinary with\r\nMariamne. So he gave order that Sohemus should be seized on and slain\r\nimmediately; but he allowed his wife to take her trial; and got together\r\nthose that were most faithful to him, and laid an elaborate accusation\r\nagainst her for this love potion and composition, which had been charged\r\nupon her by way of calumny only. However, he kept no temper in what he\r\nsaid, and was in too great a passion for judging well about this matter.\r\nAccordingly, when the court was at length satisfied that he was so\r\nresolved, they passed the sentence of death upon her; but when the\r\nsentence was passed upon her, this temper was suggested by himself, and\r\nby some others of the court, that she should not be thus hastily put to\r\ndeath, but be laid in prison in one of the fortresses belonging to the\r\nkingdom: but Salome and her party labored hard to have the woman put to\r\ndeath; and they prevailed with the king to do so, and advised this out\r\nof caution, lest the multitude should be tumultuous if she were suffered\r\nto live; and thus was Mariamne led to execution.\r\n\r\n5. When Alexandra observed how things went, and that there were small\r\nhopes that she herself should escape the like treatment from Herod, she\r\nchanged her behavior to quite the reverse of what might have been\r\nexpected from her former boldness, and this after a very indecent\r\nmanner; for out of her desire to show how entirely ignorant she was of\r\nthe crimes laid against Mariamne, she leaped out of her place, and\r\nreproached her daughter in the hearing of all the people; and cried out\r\nthat she had been an ill woman, and ungrateful to her husband, and that\r\nher punishment came justly upon her for such her insolent behavior, for\r\nthat she had not made proper returns to him who had been their common\r\nbenefactor. And when she had for some time acted after this hypocritical\r\nmanner, and been so outrageous as to tear her hair, this indecent and\r\ndissembling behavior, as was to be expected, was greatly condemned by\r\nthe rest of the spectators, as it was principally by the poor woman who\r\nwas to suffer; for at the first she gave her not a word, nor was\r\ndiscomposed at her peevishness, and only looked at her, yet did she out\r\nof a greatness of soul discover her concern for her mother's offense,\r\nand especially for her exposing herself in a manner so unbecoming her;\r\nbut as for herself, she went to her death with an unshaken firmness of\r\nmind, and without changing the color of her face, and thereby evidently\r\ndiscovered the nobility of her descent to the spectators, even in the\r\nlast moments of her life.\r\n\r\n6. And thus died Mariamne, a woman of an excellent character, both for\r\nchastity and greatness of soul; but she wanted moderation, and had too\r\nmuch of contention in her nature; yet had she all that can be said in\r\nthe beauty of her body, and her majestic appearance in conversation; and\r\nthence arose the greatest part of the occasions why she did not prove so\r\nagreeable to the king, nor live so pleasantly with him, as she might\r\notherwise have done; for while she was most indulgently used by the\r\nking, out of his fondness for her, and did not expect that he could do\r\nany hard thing to her, she took too unbounded a liberty. Moreover, that\r\nwhich most afflicted her was, what he had done to her relations, and she\r\nventured to speak of all they had suffered by him, and at last greatly\r\nprovoked both the king's mother and sister, till they became enemies to\r\nher; and even he himself also did the same, on whom alone she depended\r\nfor her expectations of escaping the last of punishments.\r\n\r\n7. But when she was once dead, the king's affections for her were\r\nkindled in a more outrageous manner than before, whose old passion for\r\nher we have already described; for his love to her was not of a calm\r\nnature, nor such as we usually meet with among other husbands; for at\r\nits commencement it was of an enthusiastic kind, nor was it by their\r\nlong cohabitation and free conversation together brought under his power\r\nto manage; but at this time his love to Mariamne seemed to seize him in\r\nsuch a peculiar manner, as looked like Divine vengeance upon him for the\r\ntaking away her life; for he would frequently call for her, and\r\nfrequently lament for her in a most indecent manner. Moreover, he\r\nbethought him of every thing he could make use of to divert his mind\r\nfrom thinking of her, and contrived feasts and assemblies for that\r\npurpose, but nothing would suffice; he therefore laid aside the\r\nadministration of public affairs, and was so far conquered by his\r\npassion, that he would order his servants to call for Mariamne, as if\r\nshe were still alive, and could still hear them. And when he was in this\r\nway, there arose a pestilential disease, and carried off the greatest\r\npart of the multitude, and of his best and most esteemed friends, and\r\nmade all men suspect that this was brought upon them by the anger of\r\nGod, for the injustice that had been done to Mariamne. This circumstance\r\naffected the king still more, till at length he forced himself to go\r\ninto desert places, and there, under pretense of going a hunting,\r\nbitterly afflicted himself; yet had he not borne his grief there many\r\ndays before he fell into a most dangerous distemper himself: he had an\r\ninflammation upon him, and a pain in the hinder part of his head, joined\r\nwith madness; and for the remedies that were used, they did him no good\r\nat all, but proved contrary to his case, and so at length brought him to\r\ndespair. All the physicians also that were about him, partly because the\r\nmedicines they brought for his recovery could not at all conquer the\r\ndisease, and partly because his diet could be no other than what his\r\ndisease inclined him to, desired him to eat whatever he had a mind to,\r\nand so left the small hopes they had of his recovery in the power of\r\nthat diet, and committed him to fortune. And thus did his distemper go\r\non, while he was at Samaria, now called Sebaste.\r\n\r\n8. Now Alexandra abode at this time at Jerusalem; and being informed\r\nwhat condition Herod was in, she endeavored to get possession of the\r\nfortified places that were about the city, which were two, the one\r\nbelonging to the city itself, the other belonging to the temple; and\r\nthose that could get them into their hands had the whole nation under\r\ntheir power, for without the command of them it was not possible to\r\noffer their sacrifices; and to think of leaving on those sacrifices is\r\nto every Jew plainly impossible, who are still more ready to lose their\r\nlives than to leave off that Divine worship which they have been wont to\r\npay unto God. Alexandra, therefore, discoursed with those that had the\r\nkeeping of these strong holds, that it was proper for them to deliver\r\nthe same to her, and to Herod's sons, lest, upon his death, any other\r\nperson should seize upon the government; and that upon his recovery none\r\ncould keep them more safely for him than those of his own family. These\r\nwords were not by them at all taken in good part; and as they had been\r\nin former times faithful [to Herod], they resolved to continue so more\r\nthan ever, both because they hated Alexandra, and because they thought\r\nit a sort of impiety to despair of Herod's recovery while he was yet\r\nalive, for they had been his old friends; and one of them, whose name\r\nwas Achiabus, was his cousin-german. They sent messengers therefore to\r\nacquaint him with Alexandra's design; so he made no longer delay, but\r\ngave orders to have her slain; yet was it still with difficulty, and\r\nafter he had endured great pain, that he got clear of his distemper. He\r\nwas still sorely afflicted, both in mind and body, and made very uneasy,\r\nand readier than ever upon all occasions to inflict punishment upon\r\nthose that fell under his hand. He also slew the most intimate of his\r\nfriends, Costobarus, and Lysimachus, and Cadias, who was also called\r\nAntipater; as also Dositheus, and that upon the following occasion.\r\n\r\n9. Costobarus was an Idumean by birth, and one of principal dignity\r\namong them, and one whose ancestors had been priests to the Koze, whom\r\nthe Idumeans had [formerly] esteemed as a god; but after Hyrcanus had\r\nmade a change in their political government, and made them receive the\r\nJewish customs and law, Herod made Costobarus governor of Idumea and\r\nGaza, and gave him his sister Salome to wife; and this was upon the\r\nslaughter of [his uncle] Joseph, who had that government before, as we\r\nhave related already. When Costobarus had gotten to be so highly\r\nadvanced, it pleased him and was more than he hoped for, and he was more\r\nand more puffed up by his good success, and in a little while he\r\nexceeded all bounds, and did not think fit to obey what Herod, as their\r\nruler, commanded him, or that the Idumeans should make use of the Jewish\r\ncustoms, or be subject to them. He therefore sent to Cleopatra, and\r\ninformed her that the Idumeans had been always under his progenitors,\r\nand that for the same reason it was but just that she should desire that\r\ncountry for him of Antony, for that he was ready to transfer his\r\nfriendship to her; and this he did, not because he was better pleased to\r\nbe under Cleopatra's government, but because he thought that, upon the\r\ndiminution of Herod's power, it would not be difficult for him to obtain\r\nhimself the entire government over the Idumeans, and somewhat more also;\r\nfor he raised his hopes still higher, as having no small pretenses, both\r\nby his birth and by these riches which he had gotten by his constant\r\nattention to filthy lucre; and accordingly it was not a small matter\r\nthat he aimed at. So Cleopatra desired this country of Antony, but\r\nfailed of her purpose. An account of this was brought to Herod, who was\r\nthereupon ready to kill Costobarus; yet, upon the entreaties of his\r\nsister and mother, he forgave him, and vouchsafed to pardon him\r\nentirely; though he still had a suspicion of him afterward for this his\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\n10. But some time afterward, when Salome happened to quarrel with\r\nCostobarus, she sent him a bill of divorce 12 and dissolved her marriage\r\nwith him, though this was not according to the Jewish laws; for with us\r\nit is lawful for a husband to do so; but a wife; if she departs from her\r\nhusband, cannot of herself be married to another, unless her former\r\nhusband put her away. However, Salome chose to follow not the law of her\r\ncountry, but the law of her authority, and so renounced her wedlock; and\r\ntold her brother Herod, that she left her husband out of her good-will\r\nto him, because she perceived that he, with Antipater, and Lysimachus,\r\nand Dositheus, were raising a sedition against him; as an evidence\r\nwhereof, she alleged the case of the sons of Babas, that they had been\r\nby him preserved alive already for the interval of twelve years; which\r\nproved to be true. But when Herod thus unexpectedly heard of it, he was\r\ngreatly surprised at it, and was the more surprised, because the\r\nrelation appeared incredible to him. As for the fact relating to these\r\nsons of Babas, Herod had formerly taken great pains to bring them to\r\npunishment, as being enemies to his government; but they were now\r\nforgotten by him, on account of the length of time [since he had ordered\r\nthem to be slain]. Now the cause of his ill-will and hatred to them\r\narose hence, that while Antigonus was king, Herod, with his army,\r\nbesieged the city of Jerusalem, where the distress and miseries which\r\nthe besieged endured were so pressing, that the greater number of them\r\ninvited Herod into the city, and already placed their hopes on him. Now\r\nthe sons of Babas were of great dignity, and had power among the\r\nmultitude, and were faithful to Antigonus, and were always raising\r\ncalumnies against Herod, and encouraged the people to preserve the\r\ngovernment to that royal family which held it by inheritance. So these\r\nmen acted thus politically, and, as they thought, for their own\r\nadvantage; but when the city was taken, and Herod had gotten the\r\ngovernment into his hands, and Costobarus was appointed to hinder men\r\nfrom passing out at the gates, and to guard the city, that those\r\ncitizens that were guilty, and of the party opposite to the king, might\r\nnot get out of it, Costobarus, being sensible that the sons of Babas\r\nwere had in respect and honor by the whole multitude, and supposing that\r\ntheir preservation might be of great advantage to him in the changes of\r\ngovernment afterward, he set them by themselves, and concealed them in\r\nhis own farms; and when the thing was suspected, he assured Herod upon\r\noath that he really knew nothing of that matter, and so overcame the\r\nsuspicions that lay upon him; nay, after that, when the king had\r\npublicly proposed a reward for the discovery, and had put in practice\r\nall sorts of methods for searching out this matter, he would not confess\r\nit; but being persuaded that when he had at first denied it, if the men\r\nwere found, he should not escape unpunished, he was forced to keep them\r\nsecret, not only out of his good-will to them, but out of a necessary\r\nregard to his own preservation also. But when the king knew the thing,\r\nby his sister's information, he sent men to the places where he had the\r\nintimation they were concealed, and ordered both them, and those that\r\nwere accused as guilty with them, to be slain, insomuch that there were\r\nnow none at all left of the kindred of Hyrcanus, and the kingdom was\r\nentirely in Herod's own power, and there was nobody remaining of such\r\ndignity as could put a stop to what he did against the Jewish laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. How Ten Men Of The Citizens [Of Jerusalem] Made A Conspiracy\r\nAgainst Herod, For The Foreign Practices He Had Introduced, Which Was A\r\nTransgression Of The Laws Of Their Country. Concerning The Building Of\r\nSebaste And Cæsarea, And Other Edifices Of Herod.\r\n\r\n1. On this account it was that Herod revolted from the laws of his\r\ncountry, and corrupted their ancient constitution, by the introduction\r\nof foreign practices, which constitution yet ought to have been\r\npreserved inviolable; by which means we became guilty of great\r\nwickedness afterward, while those religious observances which used to\r\nlead the multitude to piety were now neglected; for, in the first place,\r\nhe appointed solemn games to be celebrated every fifth year, in honor of\r\nCæsar, and built a theater at Jerusalem, as also a very great\r\namphitheater in the plain. Both of them were indeed costly works, but\r\nopposite to the Jewish customs; for we have had no such shows delivered\r\ndown to us as fit to be used or exhibited by us; yet did he celebrate\r\nthese games every five years, in the most solemn and splendid manner. He\r\nalso made proclamation to the neighboring countries, and called men\r\ntogether out of every nation. The wrestlers also, and the rest of those\r\nthat strove for the prizes in such games, were invited out of every\r\nland, both by the hopes of the rewards there to be bestowed, and by the\r\nglory of victory to be there gained. So the principal persons that were\r\nthe most eminent in these sorts of exercises were gotten together, for\r\nthere were very great rewards for victory proposed, not only to those\r\nthat performed their exercises naked, but to those that played the\r\nmusicians also, and were called Thymelici; and he spared no pains to\r\ninduce all persons, the most famous for such exercises, to come to this\r\ncontest for victory. He also proposed no small rewards to those who ran\r\nfor the prizes in chariot races, when they were drawn by two, or three,\r\nor four pair of horses. He also imitated every thing, though never so\r\ncostly or magnificent, in other nations, out of an ambition that he\r\nmight give most public demonstration of his grandeur. Inscriptions also\r\nof the great actions of Cæsar, and trophies of those nations which he\r\nhad conquered in his wars, and all made of the purest gold and silver,\r\nencompassed the theater itself; nor was there any thing that could be\r\nsubservient to his design, whether it were precious garments, or\r\nprecious stones set in order, which was not also exposed to sight in\r\nthese games. He had also made a great preparation of wild beasts, and of\r\nlions themselves in great abundance, and of such other beasts as were\r\neither of uncommon strength, or of such a sort as were rarely seen.\r\nThese were prepared either to fight with one another, or that men who\r\nwere condemned to death were to fight with them. And truly foreigners\r\nwere greatly surprised and delighted at the vastness of the expenses\r\nhere exhibited, and at the great dangers that were here seen; but to\r\nnatural Jews, this was no better than a dissolution of those customs for\r\nwhich they had so great a veneration. 13 It appeared also no better than\r\nan instance of barefaced impiety, to throw men to wild beasts, for the\r\naffording delight to the spectators; and it appeared an instance of no\r\nless impiety, to change their own laws for such foreign exercises: but,\r\nabove all the rest, the trophies gave most distaste to the Jews; for as\r\nthey imagined them to be images, included within the armor that hung\r\nround about them, they were sorely displeased at them, because it was\r\nnot the custom of their country to pay honors to such images.\r\n\r\n2. Nor was Herod unacquainted with the disturbance they were under; and\r\nas he thought it unseasonable to use violence with them, so he spake to\r\nsome of them by way of consolation, and in order to free them from that\r\nsuperstitious fear they were under; yet could not he satisfy them, but\r\nthey cried out with one accord, out of their great uneasiness at the\r\noffenses they thought he had been guilty of, that although they should\r\nthink of bearing all the rest yet would they never bear images of men in\r\ntheir city, meaning the trophies, because this was disagreeable to the\r\nlaws of their country. Now when Herod saw them in such a disorder, and\r\nthat they would not easily change their resolution unless they received\r\nsatisfaction in this point, he called to him the most eminent men among\r\nthem, and brought them upon the theater, and showed them the trophies,\r\nand asked them what sort of things they took these trophies to be; and\r\nwhen they cried out that they were the images of men, he gave order that\r\nthey should be stripped of these outward ornaments which were about\r\nthem, and showed them the naked pieces of wood; which pieces of wood,\r\nnow without any ornament, became matter of great sport and laughter to\r\nthem, because they had before always had the ornaments of images\r\nthemselves in derision.\r\n\r\n3. When therefore Herod had thus got clear of the multitude, and had\r\ndissipated the vehemency of passion under which they had been, the\r\ngreatest part of the people were disposed to change their conduct, and\r\nnot to be displeased at him any longer; but still some of them continued\r\nin their displeasure against him, for his introduction of new customs,\r\nand esteemed the violation of the laws of their country as likely to be\r\nthe origin of very great mischiefs to them, so that they deemed it an\r\ninstance of piety rather to hazard themselves [to be put to death], than\r\nto seem as if they took no notice of Herod, who, upon the change he had\r\nmade in their government, introduced such customs, and that in a violent\r\nmanner, which they had never been used to before, as indeed in pretense\r\na king, but in reality one that showed himself an enemy to their whole\r\nnation; on which account ten men that were citizens [of Jerusalem]\r\nconspired together against him, and sware to one another to undergo any\r\ndangers in the attempt, and took daggers with them under their garments\r\n[for the purpose of killing Herod]. Now there was a certain blind man\r\namong those conspirators who had thus sworn to one another, on account\r\nof the indignation he had against what he heard to have been done; he\r\nwas not indeed able to afford the rest any assistance in the\r\nundertaking, but was ready to undergo any suffering with them, if so be\r\nthey should come to any harm, insomuch that he became a very great\r\nencourager of the rest of the undertakers.\r\n\r\n4. When they had taken this resolution, and that by common consent, they\r\nwent into the theater, hoping that, in the first place, Herod himself\r\ncould not escape them, as they should fall upon him so unexpectedly; and\r\nsupposing, however, that if they missed him, they should kill a great\r\nmany of those that were about him; and this resolution they took, though\r\nthey should die for it, in order to suggest to the king what injuries he\r\nhad done to the multitude. These conspirators, therefore, standing thus\r\nprepared beforehand, went about their design with great alacrity; but\r\nthere was one of those spies of Herod, that were appointed for such\r\npurposes, to fish out and inform him of any conspiracies that should be\r\nmade against him, who found out the whole affair, and told the king of\r\nit, as he was about to go into the theater. So when he reflected on the\r\nhatred which he knew the greatest part of the people bore him, and on\r\nthe disturbances that arose upon every occasion, he thought this plot\r\nagainst him not to be improbable. Accordingly, he retired into his\r\npalace, and called those that were accused of this conspiracy before him\r\nby their several names; and as, upon the guards falling upon them, they\r\nwere caught in the very fact, and knew they could not escape, they\r\nprepared themselves for their ends with all the decency they could, and\r\nso as not at all to recede from their resolute behavior, for they showed\r\nno shame for what they were about, nor denied it; but when they were\r\nseized, they showed their daggers, and professed that the conspiracy\r\nthey had sworn to was a holy and pious action; that what they intended\r\nto do was not for gain, or out of any indulgence to their passions, but\r\nprincipally for those common customs of their country, which all the\r\nJews were obliged to observe, or to die for them. This was what these\r\nmen said, out of their undaunted courage in this conspiracy. So they\r\nwere led away to execution by the king's guards that stood about them,\r\nand patiently underwent all the torments inflicted on them till they\r\ndied. Nor was it long before that spy who had discovered them was seized\r\non by some of the people, out of the hatred they bore to him; and was\r\nnot only slain by them, but pulled to pieces, limb from limb, and given\r\nto the dogs. This execution was seen by many of the citizens, yet would\r\nnot one of them discover the doers of it, till upon Herod's making a\r\nstrict scrutiny after them, by bitter and severe tortures, certain women\r\nthat were tortured confessed what they had seen done; the authors of\r\nwhich fact were so terribly punished by the king, that their entire\r\nfamilies were destroyed for this their rash attempt; yet did not the\r\nobstinacy of the people, and that undaunted constancy they showed in the\r\ndefense of their laws, make Herod any easier to them, but he still\r\nstrengthened himself after a more secure manner, and resolved to\r\nencompass the multitude every way, lest such innovations should end in\r\nan open rebellion.\r\n\r\n5. Since, therefore, he had now the city fortified by the palace in\r\nwhich he lived, and by the temple which had a strong fortress by it,\r\ncalled Antonia, and was rebuilt by himself, he contrived to make Samaria\r\na fortress for himself also against all the people, and called it\r\nSebaste, supposing that this place would be a strong hold against the\r\ncountry, not inferior to the former. So he fortified that place, which\r\nwas a day's journey distant from Jerusalem, and which would be useful to\r\nhim in common, to keep both the country and the city in awe. He also\r\nbuilt another fortress for the whole nation; it was of old called\r\nStrato's Tower, but was by him named Cæsarea. Moreover, he chose out\r\nsome select horsemen, and placed them in the great plain; and built [for\r\nthem] a place in Galilee, called Gaba with Hesebonitis, in Perea. And\r\nthese were the places which he particularly built, while he always was\r\ninventing somewhat further for his own security, and encompassing the\r\nwhole nation with guards, that they might by no means get from under his\r\npower, nor fall into tumults, which they did continually upon any small\r\ncommotion; and that if they did make any commotions, he might know of\r\nit, while some of his spies might be upon them from the neighborhood,\r\nand might both be able to know what they were attempting, and to prevent\r\nit. And when he went about building the wall of Samaria, he contrived to\r\nbring thither many of those that had been assisting to him in his wars,\r\nand many of the people in that neighborhood also, whom he made fellow\r\ncitizens with the rest. This he did out of an ambitious desire of\r\nbuilding a temple, and out of a desire to make the city more eminent\r\nthan it had been before; but principally because he contrived that it\r\nmight at once be for his own security, and a monument of his\r\nmagnificence. He also changed its name, and called it Sebaste. Moreover,\r\nhe parted the adjoining country, which was excellent in its kind, among\r\nthe inhabitants of Samaria, that they might be in a happy condition,\r\nupon their first coming to inhabit. Besides all which, he encompassed\r\nthe city with a wall of great strength, and made use of the acclivity of\r\nthe place for making its fortifications stronger; nor was the compass of\r\nthe place made now so small as it had been before, but was such as\r\nrendered it not inferior to the most famous cities; for it was twenty\r\nfurlongs in circumference. Now within, and about the middle of it, he\r\nbuilt a sacred place, of a furlong and a half [in circuit], and adorned\r\nit with all sorts of decorations, and therein erected a temple, which\r\nwas illustrious on account of both its largeness and beauty. And as to\r\nthe several parts of the city, he adorned them with decorations of all\r\nsorts also; and as to what was necessary to provide for his own\r\nsecurity, he made the walls very strong for that purpose, and made it\r\nfor the greatest part a citadel; and as to the elegance of the building,\r\nit was taken care of also, that he might leave monuments of the fineness\r\nof his taste, and of his beneficence, to future ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. Concerning The Famine That Happened In Judea And Syria; And\r\nHow Herod, After He Had Married Another Wife, Rebuilt Cæsarea, And Other\r\nGrecian Cities.\r\n\r\n1. Now on this very year, which was the thirteenth year of the reign of\r\nHerod, very great calamities came upon the country; whether they were\r\nderived from the anger of God, or whether this misery returns again\r\nnaturally in certain periods of time 14 for, in the first place, there\r\nwere perpetual droughts, and for that reason the ground was barren, and\r\ndid not bring forth the same quantity of fruits that it used to produce;\r\nand after this barrenness of the soil, that change of food which the\r\nwant of corn occasioned produced distempers in the bodies of men, and a\r\npestilential disease prevailed, one misery following upon the back of\r\nanother; and these circumstances, that they were destitute both of\r\nmethods of cure and of food, made the pestilential distemper, which\r\nbegan after a violent manner, the more lasting. The destruction of men\r\nalso after such a manner deprived those that survived of all their\r\ncourage, because they had no way to provide remedies sufficient for the\r\ndistresses they were in. When therefore the fruits of that year were\r\nspoiled, and whatsoever they had laid up beforehand was spent, there was\r\nno foundation of hope for relief remaining, but the misery, contrary to\r\nwhat they expected still increased upon them; and this not only on that\r\nyear, while they had nothing for themselves left [at the end of it], but\r\nwhat seed they had sown perished also, by reason of the ground not\r\nyielding its fruits on the second year. 15 This distress they were in\r\nmade them also, out of necessity, to eat many things that did not use to\r\nbe eaten; nor was the king himself free from this distress any more than\r\nother men, as being deprived of that tribute he used to have from the\r\nfruits of the ground, and having already expended what money he had, in\r\nhis liberality to those whose cities he had built; nor had he any people\r\nthat were worthy of his assistance, since this miserable state of things\r\nhad procured him the hatred of his subjects: for it is a constant rule,\r\nthat misfortunes are still laid to the account of those that govern.\r\n\r\n2. In these circumstances he considered with himself how to procure some\r\nseasonable help; but this was a hard thing to be done, while their\r\nneighbors had no food to sell them; and their money also was gone, had\r\nit been possible to purchase a little food at a great price. However, he\r\nthought it his best way, by all means, not to leave off his endeavors to\r\nassist his people; so he cut off the rich furniture that was in his\r\npalace, both of silver and gold, insomuch that he did not spare the\r\nfinest vessels he had, or those that were made with the most elaborate\r\nskill of the artificers, but sent the money to Petronius, who had been\r\nmade prefect of Egypt by Cæsar; and as not a few had already fled to him\r\nunder their necessities, and as he was particularly a friend to Herod,\r\nand desirous to have his subjects preserved, he gave leave to them in\r\nthe first place to export corn, and assisted them every way, both in\r\npurchasing and exporting the same; so that he was the principal, if not\r\nthe only person, who afforded them what help they had. And Herod taking\r\ncare the people should understand that this help came from himself, did\r\nthereby not only remove the ill opinion of those that formerly hated\r\nhim, but gave them the greatest demonstration possible of his good-will\r\nto them, and care of them; for, in the first place, as for those who\r\nwere able to provide their own food, he distributed to them their\r\nproportion of corn in the exactest manner; but for those many that were\r\nnot able, either by reason of their old age, or any other infirmity, to\r\nprovide food for themselves, he made this provision for them, the bakers\r\nshould make their bread ready for them. He also took care that they\r\nmight not be hurt by the dangers of winter, since they were in great\r\nwant of clothing also, by reason of the utter destruction and\r\nconsumption of their sheep and goats, till they had no wool to make use\r\nof, nor any thing else to cover themselves withal. And when he had\r\nprocured these things for his own subjects, he went further, in order to\r\nprovide necessaries for their neighbors, and gave seed to the Syrians,\r\nwhich thing turned greatly to his own advantage also, this charitable\r\nassistance being afforded most seasonably to their fruitful soil, so\r\nthat every one had now a plentiful provision of food. Upon the whole,\r\nwhen the harvest of the land was approaching, he sent no fewer than\r\nfifty thousand men, whom he had sustained, into the country; by which\r\nmeans he both repaired the afflicted condition of his own kingdom with\r\ngreat generosity and diligence, and lightened the afflictions of his\r\nneighbors, who were under the same calamities; for there was nobody who\r\nhad been in want that was left destitute of a suitable assistance by\r\nhim; nay, further, there were neither any people, nor any cities, nor\r\nany private men, who were to make provision for the multitudes, and on\r\nthat account were in want of support, and had recourse to him, but\r\nreceived what they stood in need of, insomuch that it appeared, upon a\r\ncomputation, that the number of cori of wheat, of ten attic medimni\r\napiece, that were given to foreigners, amounted to ten thousand, and the\r\nnumber that was given in his own kingdom was about fourscore thousand.\r\nNow it happened that this care of his, and this seasonable benefaction,\r\nhad such influence on the Jews, and was so cried up among other nations,\r\nas to wipe off that old hatred which his violation of some of their\r\ncustoms, during his reign, had procured him among all the nation, and\r\nthat this liberality of his assistance in this their greatest necessity\r\nwas full satisfaction for all that he had done of that nature, as it\r\nalso procured him great fame among foreigners; and it looked as if these\r\ncalamities that afflicted his land, to a degree plainly incredible, came\r\nin order to raise his glory, and to be to his great advantage; for the\r\ngreatness of his liberality in these distresses, which he now\r\ndemonstrated beyond all expectation, did so change the disposition of\r\nthe multitude towards him, that they were ready to suppose he had been\r\nfrom the beginning not such a one as they had found him to be by\r\nexperience, but such a one as the care he had taken of them in supplying\r\ntheir necessities proved him now to be.\r\n\r\n3. About this time it was that he sent five hundred chosen men out of\r\nthe guards of his body as auxiliaries to Cæsar, whom Aelius Gallus 16\r\nled to the Red Sea, and who were of great service to him there. When\r\ntherefore his affairs were thus improved, and were again in a\r\nflourishing condition, he built himself a palace in the upper city,\r\nraising the rooms to a very great height, and adorning them with the\r\nmost costly furniture of gold, and marble scats, and beds; and these\r\nwere so large that they could contain very many companies of men. These\r\napartments were also of distinct magnitudes, and had particular names\r\ngiven them; for one apartment was called Cæsar's, another Agrippa's. He\r\nalso fell in love again, and married another wife, not suffering his\r\nreason to hinder him from living as he pleased. The occasion of this his\r\nmarriage was as follows: There was one Simon, a citizen of Jerusalem,\r\nthe son of one Boethus, a citizen of Alexandria, and a priest of great\r\nnote there; this man had a daughter, who was esteemed the most beautiful\r\nwoman of that time; and when the people of Jerusalem began to speak much\r\nin her commendation, it happened that Herod was much affected with what\r\nwas said of her; and when he saw the damsel, he was smitten with her\r\nbeauty, yet did he entirely reject the thoughts of using his authority\r\nto abuse her, as believing, what was the truth, that by so doing he\r\nshould be stigmatized for violence and tyranny; so he thought it best to\r\ntake the damsel to wife. And while Simon was of a dignity too inferior\r\nto be allied to him, but still too considerable to be despised, he\r\ngoverned his inclinations after the most prudent manner, by augmenting\r\nthe dignity of the family, and making them more honorable; so he\r\nimmediately deprived Jesus, the son of Phabet, of the high priesthood,\r\nand conferred that dignity on Simon, and so joined in affinity with him\r\n[by marrying his daughter].\r\n\r\n4. When this wedding was over, he built another citadel in that place\r\nwhere he had conquered the Jews when he was driven out of his\r\ngovernment, and Antigonus enjoyed it. This citadel is distant from\r\nJerusalem about threescore furlongs. It was strong by nature, and fit\r\nfor such a building. It is a sort of a moderate hill, raised to a\r\nfurther height by the hand of man, till it was of the shape of a woman's\r\nbreast. It is encompassed with circular towers, and hath a strait ascent\r\nup to it, which ascent is composed of steps of polished stones, in\r\nnumber two hundred. Within it are royal and very rich apartments, of a\r\nstructure that provided both for security and for beauty. About the\r\nbottom there are habitations of such a structure as are well worth\r\nseeing, both on other accounts, and also on account of the water which\r\nis brought thither from a great way off, and at vast expenses, for the\r\nplace itself is destitute of water. The plain that is about this citadel\r\nis full of edifices, not inferior to any city in largeness, and having\r\nthe hill above it in the nature of a castle.\r\n\r\n5. And now, when all Herod's designs had succeeded according to his\r\nhopes, he had not the least suspicion that any troubles could arise in\r\nhis kingdom, because he kept his people obedient, as well by the fear\r\nthey stood in of him, for he was implacable in the infliction of his\r\npunishments, as by the provident care he had showed towards them, after\r\nthe most magnanimous manner, when they were under their distresses. But\r\nstill he took care to have external security for his government as a\r\nfortress against his subjects; for the orations he made to the cities\r\nwere very fine, and full of kindness; and he cultivated a seasonable\r\ngood understanding with their governors, and bestowed presents on every\r\none of them, inducing them thereby to be more friendly to him, and using\r\nhis magnificent disposition so as his kingdom might be the better\r\nsecured to him, and this till all his affairs were every way more and\r\nmore augmented. But then this magnificent temper of his, and that\r\nsubmissive behavior and liberality which he exercised towards Cæsar, and\r\nthe most powerful men of Rome, obliged him to transgress the customs of\r\nhis nation, and to set aside many of their laws, and by building cities\r\nafter an extravagant manner, and erecting temples,—not in Judea indeed,\r\nfor that would not have been borne, it being forbidden for us to pay any\r\nhonor to images, or representations of animals, after the manner of the\r\nGreeks; but still he did thus in the country [properly] out of our\r\nbounds, and in the cities thereof 17 The apology which he made to the\r\nJews for these things was this: That all was done, not out of his own\r\ninclinations, but by the commands and injunctions of others, in order to\r\nplease Cæsar and the Romans, as though he had not the Jewish customs so\r\nmuch in his eye as he had the honor of those Romans, while yet he had\r\nhimself entirely in view all the while, and indeed was very ambitious to\r\nleave great monuments of his government to posterity; whence it was that\r\nhe was so zealous in building such fine cities, and spent such vast sums\r\nof money upon them.\r\n\r\n6. Now upon his observation of a place near the sea, which was very\r\nproper for containing a city, and was before called Strato's Tower, he\r\nset about getting a plan for a magnificent city there, and erected many\r\nedifices with great diligence all over it, and this of white stone. He\r\nalso adorned it with most sumptuous palaces and large edifices for\r\ncontaining the people; and what was the greatest and most laborious work\r\nof all, he adorned it with a haven, that was always free from the waves\r\nof the sea. Its largeness was not less than the Pyrmum [at Athens], and\r\nhad towards the city a double station for the ships. It was of excellent\r\nworkmanship; and this was the more remarkable for its being built in a\r\nplace that of itself was not suitable to such noble structures, but was\r\nto be brought to perfection by materials from other places, and at very\r\ngreat expenses. This city is situate in Phoenicia, in the passage by sea\r\nto Egypt, between Joppa and Dora, which are lesser maritime cities, and\r\nnot fit for havens, on account of the impetuous south winds that beat\r\nupon them, which rolling the sands that come from the sea against the\r\nshores, do not admit of ships lying in their station; but the merchants\r\nare generally there forced to ride at their anchors in the sea itself.\r\nSo Herod endeavored to rectify this inconvenience, and laid out such a\r\ncompass towards the land as might be sufficient for a haven, wherein the\r\ngreat ships might lie in safety; and this he effected by letting down\r\nvast stones of above fifty feet in length, not less than eighteen in\r\nbreadth, and nine in depth, into twenty fathom deep; and as some were\r\nlesser, so were others bigger than those dimensions. This mole which he\r\nbuilt by the sea-side was two hundred feet wide, the half of which was\r\nopposed to the current of the waves, so as to keep off those waves which\r\nwere to break upon them, and so was called Procymatia, or the first\r\nbreaker of the waves; but the other half had upon it a wall, with\r\nseveral towers, the largest of which was named Drusus, and was a work of\r\nvery great excellence, and had its name from Drusus, the son-in-law of\r\nCæsar, who died young. There were also a great number of arches where\r\nthe mariners dwelt. There was also before them a quay, [or landing\r\nplace,] which ran round the entire haven, and was a most agreeable walk\r\nto such as had a mind to that exercise; but the entrance or mouth of the\r\nport was made on the north quarter, on which side was the stillest of\r\nthe winds of all in this place: and the basis of the whole circuit on\r\nthe left hand, as you enter the port, supported a round turret, which\r\nwas made very strong, in order to resist the greatest waves; while on\r\nthe right hand, as you enter, stood two vast stones, and those each of\r\nthem larger than the turret, which were over against them; these stood\r\nupright, and were joined together. Now there were edifices all along the\r\ncircular haven, made of the politest stone, with a certain elevation,\r\nwhereon was erected a temple, that was seen a great way off by those\r\nthat were sailing for that haven, and had in it two statues, the one of\r\nRome, the other of Cæsar. The city itself was called Cæsarea, which was\r\nalso itself built of fine materials, and was of a fine structure; nay,\r\nthe very subterranean vaults and cellars had no less of architecture\r\nbestowed on them than had the buildings above ground. Some of these\r\nvaults carried things at even distances to the haven and to the sea; but\r\none of them ran obliquely, and bound all the rest together, that both\r\nthe rain and the filth of the citizens were together carried off with\r\nease, and the sea itself, upon the flux of the tide from without, came\r\ninto the city, and washed it all clean. Herod also built therein a\r\ntheater of stone; and on the south quarter, behind the port, an\r\namphitheater also, capable of holding a vast number of men, and\r\nconveniently situated for a prospect to the sea. So this city was thus\r\nfinished in twelve years; 18 during which time the king did not fail to\r\ngo on both with the work, and to pay the charges that were necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. How Herod Sent His Sons To Rome; How Also He Was Accused By\r\nZenodorus And The Gadarens, But Was Cleared Of What They Accused Him Of\r\nAnd Withal Gained To Himself The Good-Will Of Cæsar. Concerning The\r\nPharisees, The Essens And Manahem.\r\n\r\n1. When Herod was engaged in such matters, and when he had already re-\r\nedified Sebaste, [Samaria,] he resolved to send his sons Alexander and\r\nAristobulus to Rome, to enjoy the company of Cæsar; who, when they came\r\nthither, lodged at the house of Pollio, 19 who was very fond of Herod's\r\nfriendship; and they had leave to lodge in Cæsar's own palace, for he\r\nreceived these sons of Herod with all humanity, and gave Herod leave to\r\ngive his kingdom to which of his sons he pleased; and besides all this,\r\nhe bestowed on him Trachon, and Batanea, and Auranitis, which he gave\r\nhim on the occasion following: One Zenodorus 20 had hired what was\r\ncalled the house of Lysanias, who, as he was not satisfied with its\r\nrevenues, became a partner with the robbers that inhabited the\r\nTrachonites, and so procured himself a larger income; for the\r\ninhabitants of those places lived in a mad way, and pillaged the country\r\nof the Damascenes, while Zenodorus did not restrain them, but partook of\r\nthe prey they acquired. Now as the neighboring people were hereby great\r\nsufferers, they complained to Varro, who was then president [of Syria],\r\nand entreated him to write to Cæsar about this injustice of Zenodorus.\r\nWhen these matters were laid before Cæsar, he wrote back to Varro to\r\ndestroy those nests of robbers, and to give the land to Herod, that so\r\nby his care the neighboring countries might be no longer disturbed with\r\nthese doings of the Trachonites; for it was not an easy firing to\r\nrestrain them, since this way of robbery had been their usual practice,\r\nand they had no other way to get their living, because they had neither\r\nany city of their own, nor lands in their possession, but only some\r\nreceptacles and dens in the earth, and there they and their cattle lived\r\nin common together. However, they had made contrivances to get pools of\r\nwater, and laid up corn in granaries for themselves, and were able to\r\nmake great resistance, by issuing out on the sudden against any that\r\nattacked them; for the entrances of their caves were narrow, in which\r\nbut one could come in at a time, and the places within incredibly large,\r\nand made very wide but the ground over their habitations was not very\r\nhigh, but rather on a plain, while the rocks are altogether hard and\r\ndifficult to be entered upon, unless any one gets into the plain road by\r\nthe guidance of another, for these roads are not straight, but have\r\nseveral revolutions. But when these men are hindered from their wicked\r\npreying upon their neighbors, their custom is to prey one upon another,\r\ninsomuch that no sort of injustice comes amiss to them. But when Herod\r\nhad received this grant from Cæsar, and was come into this country, he\r\nprocured skillful guides, and put a stop to their wicked robberies, and\r\nprocured peace and quietness to the neighboring people.\r\n\r\n2. Hereupon Zenodorus was grieved, in the first place, because his\r\nprincipality was taken away from him; and still more so, because he\r\nenvied Herod, who had gotten it; So he went up to Rome to accuse him,\r\nbut returned back again without success. Now Agrippa was [about this\r\ntime] sent to succeed Cæsar in the government of the countries beyond\r\nthe Ionian Sea, upon whom Herod lighted when he was wintering about\r\nMitylene, for he had been his particular friend and companion, and then\r\nreturned into Judea again. However, some of the Gadarens came to\r\nAgrippa, and accused Herod, whom he sent back bound to the king without\r\ngiving them the hearing. But still the Arabians, who of old bare ill-\r\nwill to Herod's government, were nettled, and at that time attempted to\r\nraise a sedition in his dominions, and, as they thought, upon a more\r\njustifiable occasion; for Zenodorus, despairing already of success as to\r\nhis own affairs, prevented [his enemies], by selling to those Arabians a\r\npart of his principality, called Auranitis, for the value of fifty\r\ntalents; but as this was included in the donations of Cæsar, they\r\ncontested the point with Herod, as unjustly deprived of what they had\r\nbought. Sometimes they did this by making incursions upon him, and\r\nsometimes by attempting force against him, and sometimes by going to law\r\nwith him. Moreover, they persuaded the poorer soldiers to help them, and\r\nwere troublesome to him, out of a constant hope that they should reduce\r\nthe people to raise a sedition; in which designs those that are in the\r\nmost miserable circumstances of life are still the most earnest; and\r\nalthough Herod had been a great while apprized of these attempts, yet\r\ndid not he indulge any severity to them, but by rational methods aimed\r\nto mitigate things, as not willing to give any handle for tumults.\r\n\r\n3. Now when Herod had already reigned seventeen years, Cæsar came into\r\nSyria; at which time the greatest part of the inhabitants of Gadara\r\nclamored against Herod, as one that was heavy in his injunctions, and\r\ntyrannical. These reproaches they mainly ventured upon by the\r\nencouragement of Zenodorus, who took his oath that he would never leave\r\nHerod till he had procured that they should be severed from Herod's\r\nkingdom, and joined to Cæsar's province. The Gadarens were induced\r\nhereby, and made no small cry against him, and that the more boldly,\r\nbecause those that had been delivered up by Agrippa were not punished by\r\nHerod, who let them go, and did them no harm; for indeed he was the\r\nprincipal man in the world who appeared almost inexorable in punishing\r\ncrimes in his own family, but very generous in remitting the offenses\r\nthat were committed elsewhere. And while they accused Herod of injuries,\r\nand plunderings, and subversions of temples, he stood unconcerned, and\r\nwas ready to make his defense. However, Cæsar gave him his right hand,\r\nand remitted nothing of his kindness to him, upon this disturbance by\r\nthe multitude; and indeed these things were alleged the first day, but\r\nthe hearing proceeded no further; for as the Gadarens saw the\r\ninclination of Cæsar and of his assessors, and expected, as they had\r\nreason to do, that they should be delivered up to the king, some of\r\nthem, out of a dread of the torments they might undergo, cut their own\r\nthroats in the night time, and some of them threw themselves down\r\nprecipices, and others of them cast themselves into the river, and\r\ndestroyed themselves of their own accord; which accidents seemed a\r\nsufficient condemnation of the rashness and crimes they had been guilty\r\nof; whereupon Cæsar made no longer delay, but cleared Herod from the\r\ncrimes he was accused of. Another happy accident there was, which was a\r\nfurther great advantage to Herod at this time; for Zenodorus's belly\r\nburst, and a great quantity of blood issued from him in his sickness,\r\nand he thereby departed this life at Antioch in Syria; so Cæsar bestowed\r\nhis country, which was no small one, upon Herod; it lay between Trachon\r\nand Galilee, and contained Ulatha, and Paneas, and the country round\r\nabout. He also made him one of the procurators of Syria, and commanded\r\nthat they should do every thing with his approbation; and, in short, he\r\narrived at that pitch of felicity, that whereas there were but two men\r\nthat governed the vast Roman empire, first Cæsar, and then Agrippa, who\r\nwas his principal favorite, Cæsar preferred no one to Herod besides\r\nAgrippa, and Agrippa made no one his greater friend than Herod besides\r\nCæsar. And when he had acquired such freedom, he begged of Cæsar a\r\ntetrarchy 21 for his brother Pheroras, while he did himself bestow upon\r\nhim a revenue of a hundred talents out of his own kingdom, that in case\r\nhe came to any harm himself, his brother might be in safety, and that\r\nhis sons might not have dominion over him. So when he had conducted\r\nCæsar to the sea, and was returned home, he built him a most beautiful\r\ntemple, of the whitest stone, in Zenodorus's country, near the place\r\ncalled Panlure. This is a very fine cave in a mountain, under which\r\nthere is a great cavity in the earth, and the cavern is abrupt, and\r\nprodigiously deep, and full of a still water; over it hangs a vast\r\nmountain; and under the caverns arise the springs of the river Jordan.\r\nHerod adorned this place, which was already a very remarkable one, still\r\nfurther by the erection of this temple, which he dedicated to Cæsar.\r\n\r\n4. At which time Herod released to his subjects the third part of their\r\ntaxes, under pretense indeed of relieving them, after the dearth they\r\nhad had; but the main reason was, to recover their good-will, which he\r\nnow wanted; for they were uneasy at him, because of the innovations he\r\nhad introduced in their practices, of the dissolution of their religion,\r\nand of the disuse of their own customs; and the people every where\r\ntalked against him, like those that were still more provoked and\r\ndisturbed at his procedure; against which discontents he greatly guarded\r\nhimself, and took away the opportunities they might have to disturb him,\r\nand enjoined them to be always at work; nor did he permit the citizens\r\neither to meet together, or to walk or eat together, but watched every\r\nthing they did, and when any were caught, they were severely punished;\r\nand many there were who were brought to the citadel Hyrcania, both\r\nopenly and secretly, and were there put to death; and there were spies\r\nset every where, both in the city and in the roads, who watched those\r\nthat met together; nay, it is reported that he did not himself neglect\r\nthis part of caution, but that he would oftentimes himself take the\r\nhabit of a private man, and mix among the multitude, in the night time,\r\nand make trial what opinion they had of his government: and as for those\r\nthat could no way be reduced to acquiesce under his scheme of\r\ngovernment, he prosecuted them all manner of ways; but for the rest of\r\nthe multitude, he required that they should be obliged to take an oath\r\nof fidelity to him, and at the same time compelled them to swear that\r\nthey would bear him good-will, and continue certainly so to do, in his\r\nmanagement of the government; and indeed a great part of them, either to\r\nplease him, or out of fear of him, yielded to what he required of them;\r\nbut for such as were of a more open and generous disposition, and had\r\nindignation at the force he used to them, he by one means or other made\r\naway, with them. He endeavored also to persuade Pollio the Pharisee, and\r\nSatneas, and the greatest part of their scholars, to take the oath; but\r\nthese would neither submit so to do, nor were they punished together\r\nwith the rest, out of the reverence he bore to Pollio. The Essens also,\r\nas we call a sect of ours, were excused from this imposition. These men\r\nlive the same kind of life as do those whom the Greeks call\r\nPythagoreans, concerning whom I shall discourse more fully elsewhere.\r\nHowever, it is but fit to set down here the reasons wherefore Herod had\r\nthese Essens in such honor, and thought higher of them than their mortal\r\nnature required; nor will this account be unsuitable to the nature of\r\nthis history, as it will show the opinion men had of these Essens.\r\n\r\n5. Now there was one of these Essens, whose name was Manahem, who had\r\nthis testimony, that he not only conducted his life after an excellent\r\nmanner, but had the foreknowledge of future events given him by God\r\nalso. This man once saw Herod when he was a child, and going to school,\r\nand saluted him as king of the Jews; but he, thinking that either he did\r\nnot know him, or that he was in jest, put him in mind that he was but a\r\nprivate man; but Manahem smiled to himself, and clapped him on his\r\nbackside with his hand, and said, \"However that be, thou wilt be king,\r\nand wilt begin thy reign happily, for God finds thee worthy of it. And\r\ndo thou remember the blows that Manahem hath given thee, as being a\r\nsignal of the change of thy fortune. And truly this will be the best\r\nreasoning for thee, that thou love justice [towards men], and piety\r\ntowards God, and clemency towards thy citizens; yet do I know how thy\r\nwhole conduct will be, that thou wilt not be such a one, for thou wilt\r\nexcel all men in happiness, and obtain an everlasting reputation, but\r\nwilt forget piety and righteousness; and these crimes will not be\r\nconcealed from God, at the conclusion of thy life, when thou wilt find\r\nthat he will be mindful of them, and punish them for them.\" Now at that\r\ntime Herod did not at all attend to what Manahem said, as having no\r\nhopes of such advancement; but a little afterward, when he was so\r\nfortunate as to be advanced to the dignity of king, and was in the\r\nheight of his dominion, he sent for Manahem, and asked him how long he\r\nshould reign. Manahem did not tell him the full length of his reign;\r\nwherefore, upon that silence of his, he asked him further, whether he\r\nshould reign ten years or not? He replied, \"Yes, twenty, nay, thirty\r\nyears;\" but did not assign the just determinate limit of his reign.\r\nHerod was satisfied with these replies, and gave Manahem his hand, and\r\ndismissed him; and from that time he continued to honor all the Essens.\r\nWe have thought it proper to relate these facts to our readers, how\r\nstrange soever they be, and to declare what hath happened among us,\r\nbecause many of these Essens have, by their excellent virtue, been\r\nthought worthy of this knowledge of Divine revelations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. How Herod Rebuilt The Temple And Raised It Higher And Made\r\nIt More Magnificent Than It Was Before; As Also Concerning That Tower\r\nWhich He Called Antonia.\r\n\r\n1. And now Herod, in the eighteenth year of his reign, and after the\r\nacts already mentioned, undertook a very great work, that is, to build\r\nof himself the temple of God, 22 and make it larger in compass, and to\r\nraise it to a most magnificent altitude, as esteeming it to be the most\r\nglorious of all his actions, as it really was, to bring it to\r\nperfection; and that this would be sufficient for an everlasting\r\nmemorial of him; but as he knew the multitude were not ready nor willing\r\nto assist him in so vast a design, he thought to prepare them first by\r\nmaking a speech to them, and then set about the work itself; so he\r\ncalled them together, and spake thus to them: \"I think I need not speak\r\nto you, my countrymen, about such other works as I have done since I\r\ncame to the kingdom, although I may say they have been performed in such\r\na manner as to bring more security to you than glory to myself; for I\r\nhave neither been negligent in the most difficult times about what\r\ntended to ease your necessities, nor have the buildings. I have made\r\nbeen so proper to preserve me as yourselves from injuries; and I imagine\r\nthat, with God's assistance, I have advanced the nation of the Jews to a\r\ndegree of happiness which they never had before; and for the particular\r\nedifices belonging to your own country, and your own cities, as also to\r\nthose cities that we have lately acquired, which we have erected and\r\ngreatly adorned, and thereby augmented the dignity of your nation, it\r\nseems to me a needless task to enumerate them to you, since you well\r\nknow them yourselves; but as to that undertaking which I have a mind to\r\nset about at present, and which will be a work of the greatest piety and\r\nexcellence that can possibly be undertaken by us, I will now declare it\r\nto you. Our fathers, indeed, when they were returned from Babylon, built\r\nthis temple to God Almighty, yet does it want sixty cubits of its\r\nlargeness in altitude; for so much did that first temple which Solomon\r\nbuilt exceed this temple; nor let any one condemn our fathers for their\r\nnegligence or want of piety herein, for it was not their fault that the\r\ntemple was no higher; for they were Cyrus, and Darius the son of\r\nHystaspes, who determined the measures for its rebuilding; and it hath\r\nbeen by reason of the subjection of those fathers of ours to them and to\r\ntheir posterity, and after them to the Macedonians, that they had not\r\nthe opportunity to follow the original model of this pious edifice, nor\r\ncould raise it to its ancient altitude; but since I am now, by God's\r\nwill, your governor, and I have had peace a long time, and have gained\r\ngreat riches and large revenues, and, what is the principal thing of\r\nall, I am at amity with and well regarded by the Romans, who, if I may\r\nso say, are the rulers of the whole world, I will do my endeavor to\r\ncorrect that imperfection, which hath arisen from the necessity of our\r\naffairs, and the slavery we have been under formerly, and to make a\r\nthankful return, after the most pious manner, to God, for what blessings\r\nI have received from him, by giving me this kingdom, and that by\r\nrendering his temple as complete as I am able.\"\r\n\r\n2. And this was the speech which Herod made to them; but still this\r\nspeech affrighted many of the people, as being unexpected by them; and\r\nbecause it seemed incredible, it did not encourage them, but put a damp\r\nupon them, for they were afraid that he would pull down the whole\r\nedifice, and not be able to bring his intentions to perfection for its\r\nrebuilding; and this danger appeared to them to be very great, and the\r\nvastness of the undertaking to be such as could hardly be accomplished.\r\nBut while they were in this disposition, the king encouraged them, and\r\ntold them he would not pull down their temple till all things were\r\ngotten ready for building it up entirely again. And as he promised them\r\nthis beforehand, so he did not break his word with them, but got ready a\r\nthousand waggons, that were to bring stones for the building, and chose\r\nout ten thousand of the most skillful workmen, and bought a thousand\r\nsacerdotal garments for as many of the priests, and had some of them\r\ntaught the arts of stone-cutters, and others of carpenters, and then\r\nbegan to build; but this not till every thing was well prepared for the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n3. So Herod took away the old foundations, and laid others, and erected\r\nthe temple upon them, being in length a hundred cubits, and in height\r\ntwenty additional cubits, which [twenty], upon the sinking of their\r\nfoundations 23 fell down; and this part it was that we resolved to raise\r\nagain in the days of Nero. Now the temple was built of stones that were\r\nwhite and strong, and each of their length was twenty-five cubits, their\r\nheight was eight, and their breadth about twelve; and the whole\r\nstructure, as also the structure of the royal cloister, was on each side\r\nmuch lower, but the middle was much higher, till they were visible to\r\nthose that dwelt in the country for a great many furlongs, but chiefly\r\nto such as lived over against them, and those that approached to them.\r\nThe temple had doors also at the entrance, and lintels over them, of the\r\nsame height with the temple itself. They were adorned with embroidered\r\nveils, with their flowers of purple, and pillars interwoven; and over\r\nthese, but under the crown-work, was spread out a golden vine, with its\r\nbranches hanging down from a great height, the largeness and fine\r\nworkmanship of which was a surprising sight to the spectators, to see\r\nwhat vast materials there were, and with what great skill the\r\nworkmanship was done. He also encompassed the entire temple with very\r\nlarge cloisters, contriving them to be in a due proportion thereto; and\r\nhe laid out larger sums of money upon them than had been done before\r\nhim, till it seemed that no one else had so greatly adorned the temple\r\nas he had done. There was a large wall to both the cloisters, which wall\r\nwas itself the most prodigious work that was ever heard of by man. The\r\nhill was a rocky ascent, that declined by degrees towards the east parts\r\nof the city, till it came to an elevated level. This hill it was which\r\nSolomon, who was the first of our kings, by Divine revelation,\r\nencompassed with a wall; it was of excellent workmanship upwards, and\r\nround the top of it. He also built a wall below, beginning at the\r\nbottom, which was encompassed by a deep valley; and at the south side he\r\nlaid rocks together, and bound them one to another with lead, and\r\nincluded some of the inner parts, till it proceeded to a great height,\r\nand till both the largeness of the square edifice and its altitude were\r\nimmense, and till the vastness of the stones in the front were plainly\r\nvisible on the outside, yet so that the inward parts were fastened\r\ntogether with iron, and preserved the joints immovable for all future\r\ntimes. When this work [for the foundation] was done in this manner, and\r\njoined together as part of the hill itself to the very top of it, he\r\nwrought it all into one outward surface, and filled up the hollow places\r\nwhich were about the wall, and made it a level on the external upper\r\nsurface, and a smooth level also. This hill was walled all round, and in\r\ncompass four furlongs, [the distance of] each angle containing in length\r\na furlong: but within this wall, and on the very top of all, there ran\r\nanother wall of stone also, having, on the east quarter, a double\r\ncloister, of the same length with the wall; in the midst of which was\r\nthe temple itself. This cloister looked to the gates of the temple; and\r\nit had been adorned by many kings in former times; and round about the\r\nentire temple were fixed the spoils taken from barbarous nations; all\r\nthese had been dedicated to the temple by Herod, with the addition of\r\nthose he had taken from the Arabians.\r\n\r\n4. Now on the north side [of the temple] was built a citadel, whose\r\nwalls were square, and strong, and of extraordinary firmness. This\r\ncitadel was built by the kings of the Asamonean race, who were also high\r\npriests before Herod, and they called it the Tower, in which were\r\nreposited the vestments of the high priest, which the high priest only\r\nput on at the time when he was to offer sacrifice. These vestments king\r\nHerod kept in that place; and after his death they were under the power\r\nof the Romans, until the time of Tiberius Cæsar; under whose reign\r\nVitellius, the president of Syria, when he once came to Jerusalem, and\r\nhad been most magnificently received by the multitude, he had a mind to\r\nmake them some requital for the kindness they had shewn him; so, upon\r\ntheir petition to have those holy vestments in their own power, he wrote\r\nabout them to Tiberius Cæsar, who granted his request: and this their\r\npower over the sacerdotal vestments continued with the Jews till the\r\ndeath of king Agrippa; but after that, Cassius Longinus, who was\r\npresident of Syria, and Cuspius Fadus, who was procurator of Judea,\r\nenjoined the Jews to reposit those vestments in the tower of Antonia,\r\nfor that they ought to have them in their power, as they formerly had.\r\nHowever, the Jews sent ambassadors to Claudius Cæsar, to intercede with\r\nhim for them; upon whose coming, king Agrippa, junior, being then at\r\nRome, asked for and obtained the power over them from the emperor, who\r\ngave command to Vitellius, who was then commander in Syria, to give it\r\nthem accordingly. Before that time they were kept under the seal of the\r\nhigh priest, and of the treasurers of the temple; which treasurers, the\r\nday before a festival, went up to the Roman captain of the temple\r\nguards, and viewed their own seal, and received the vestments; and\r\nagain, when the festival was over, they brought it to the same place,\r\nand showed the captain of the temple guards their seal, which\r\ncorresponded with his seal, and reposited them there. And that these\r\nthings were so, the afflictions that happened to us afterwards [about\r\nthem] are sufficient evidence. But for the tower itself, when Herod the\r\nking of the Jews had fortified it more firmly than before, in order to\r\nsecure and guard the temple, he gratified Antonius, who was his friend,\r\nand the Roman ruler, and then gave it the name of the Tower of Antonia.\r\n\r\n5. Now in the western quarters of the enclosure of the temple there were\r\nfour gates; the first led to the king's palace, and went to a passage\r\nover the intermediate valley; two more led to the suburbs of the city;\r\nand the last led to the other city, where the road descended down into\r\nthe valley by a great number of steps, and thence up again by the ascent\r\nfor the city lay over against the temple in the manner of a theater, and\r\nwas encompassed with a deep valley along the entire south quarter; but\r\nthe fourth front of the temple, which was southward, had indeed itself\r\ngates in its middle, as also it had the royal cloisters, with three\r\nwalks, which reached in length from the east valley unto that on the\r\nwest, for it was impossible it should reach any farther: and this\r\ncloister deserves to be mentioned better than any other under the sun;\r\nfor while the valley was very deep, and its bottom could not be seen, if\r\nyou looked from above into the depth, this further vastly high elevation\r\nof the cloister stood upon that height, insomuch that if any one looked\r\ndown from the top of the battlements, or down both those altitudes, he\r\nwould be giddy, while his sight could not reach to such an immense\r\ndepth. This cloister had pillars that stood in four rows one over\r\nagainst the other all along, for the fourth row was interwoven into the\r\nwall, which [also was built of stone]; and the thickness of each pillar\r\nwas such, that three men might, with their arms extended, fathom it\r\nround, and join their hands again, while its length was twenty-seven\r\nfeet, with a double spiral at its basis; and the number of all the\r\npillars [in that court] was a hundred and sixty-two. Their chapiters\r\nwere made with sculptures after the Corinthian order, and caused an\r\namazement [to the spectators], by reason of the grandeur of the whole.\r\nThese four rows of pillars included three intervals for walking in the\r\nmiddle of this cloister; two of which walks were made parallel to each\r\nother, and were contrived after the same manner; the breadth of each of\r\nthem was thirty feet, the length was a furlong, and the height fifty\r\nfeet; but the breadth of the middle part of the cloister was one and a\r\nhalf of the other, and the height was double, for it was much higher\r\nthan those on each side; but the roofs were adorned with deep sculptures\r\nin wood, representing many sorts of figures. The middle was much higher\r\nthan the rest, and the wall of the front was adorned with beams, resting\r\nupon pillars, that were interwoven into it, and that front was all of\r\npolished stone, insomuch that its fineness, to such as had not seen it,\r\nwas incredible, and to such as had seen it, was greatly amazing. Thus\r\nwas the first enclosure. In the midst of which, and not far from it, was\r\nthe second, to be gone up to by a few steps: this was encompassed by a\r\nstone wall for a partition, with an inscription, which forbade any\r\nforeigner to go in under pain of death. Now this inner enclosure had on\r\nits southern and northern quarters three gates [equally] distant one\r\nfrom another; but on the east quarter, towards the sun-rising, there was\r\none large gate, through which such as were pure came in, together with\r\ntheir wives; but the temple further inward in that gate was not allowed\r\nto the women; but still more inward was there a third [court of the]\r\ntemple, whereinto it was not lawful for any but the priests alone to\r\nenter. The temple itself was within this; and before that temple was the\r\naltar, upon which we offer our sacrifices and burnt-offerings to God.\r\nInto none of these three did king Herod enter, 24 for he was forbidden,\r\nbecause he was not a priest. However, he took care of the cloisters and\r\nthe outer enclosures, and these he built in eight years.\r\n\r\n6. But the temple itself was built by the priests in a year and six\r\nmonths; upon which all the people were full of joy; and presently they\r\nreturned thanks, in the first place, to God; and in the next place, for\r\nthe alacrity the king had showed. They feasted and celebrated this\r\nrebuilding of the temple: and for the king, he sacrificed three hundred\r\noxen to God, as did the rest every one according to his ability; the\r\nnumber of which sacrifices is not possible to set down, for it cannot be\r\nthat we should truly relate it; for at the same time with this\r\ncelebration for the work about the temple fell also the day of the\r\nking's inauguration, which he kept of an old custom as a festival, and\r\nit now coincided with the other, which coincidence of them both made the\r\nfestival most illustrious.\r\n\r\n7. There was also an occult passage built for the king; it led from\r\nAntonia to the inner temple, at its eastern gate; over which he also\r\nerected for himself a tower, that he might have the opportunity of a\r\nsubterraneous ascent to the temple, in order to guard against any\r\nsedition which might be made by the people against their kings. It is\r\nalso reported, 25 that during the time that the temple was building, it\r\ndid not rain in the daytime, but that the showers fell in the nights, so\r\nthat the work was not hindered. And this our fathers have delivered to\r\nus; nor is it incredible, if any one have regard to the manifestations\r\nof God. And thus was performed the work of the rebuilding of the temple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ The city here called \"Babylon\" by Josephus, seems to be one\r\nwhich was built by some of the Seleucidae upon the Tigris, which long\r\nafter the utter desolation of old Babylon was commonly so called, and I\r\nsuppose not far from Seleueia; just as the latter adjoining city Bagdat\r\nhas been and is often called by the same old name of Babylon till this\r\nvery day.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ Here we have an eminent example of Herod's worldly and\r\nprofane politics, when by the abuse of his unlawful and usurped power,\r\nto make whom he pleased high priest, in the person of Ananelus, he\r\noccasioned such disturbances in his kingdom, and in his own family, as\r\nsuffered him to enjoy no lasting peace or tranquillity ever afterward;\r\nand such is frequently the effect of profane court politics about\r\nmatters of religion in other ages and nations.

Containing The Interval Of Twelve Years.—From The Finishing Of\r\nThe Temple By Herod To The Death Of Alexander And Aristobulus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. A Law Of Herod's About, Thieves. Salome And Pheroras\r\nCalumniate Alexander And Aristobulus, Upon Their Return From Rome For\r\nWhom Yet Herod Provides Wives.\r\n\r\n1. As king Herod was very zealous in the administration of his entire\r\ngovernment, and desirous to put a stop to particular acts of injustice\r\nwhich were done by criminals about the city and country, he made a law,\r\nno way like our original laws, and which he enacted of himself, to\r\nexpose house-breakers to be ejected out of his kingdom; which punishment\r\nwas not only grievous to be borne by the offenders, but contained in it\r\na dissolution of the customs of our forefathers; for this slavery to\r\nforeigners, and such as did not live after the manner of Jews, and this\r\nnecessity that they were under to do whatsoever such men should command,\r\nwas an offense against our religious settlement, rather than a\r\npunishment to such as were found to have offended, such a punishment\r\nbeing avoided in our original laws; for those laws ordain, that the\r\nthief shall restore fourfold; and that if he have not so much, he shall\r\nbe sold indeed, but not to foreigners, nor so that he be under perpetual\r\nslavery, for he must have been released after six years. But this law,\r\nthus enacted, in order to introduce a severe and illegal punishment,\r\nseemed to be a piece of insolence of Herod, when he did not act as a\r\nking, but as a tyrant, and thus contemptuously, and without any regard\r\nto his subjects, did he venture to introduce such a punishment. Now this\r\npenalty, thus brought into practice, was like Herod's other actions, and\r\nbecame a part of his accusation, and an occasion of the hatred he lay\r\nunder.\r\n\r\n2. Now at this time it was that he sailed to Italy, as very desirous to\r\nmeet with Cæsar, and to see his sons who lived at Rome; and Cæsar was\r\nnot only very obliging to him in other respects, but delivered him his\r\nsons again, that he might take them home with him, as having already\r\ncompleted themselves in the sciences; but as soon as the young men were\r\ncome from Italy, the multitude were very desirous to see them, and they\r\nbecame conspicuous among them all, as adorned with great blessings of\r\nfortune, and having the countenances of persons of royal dignity. So\r\nthey soon appeared to be the objects of envy to Salome, the king's\r\nsister, and to such as had raised calumnies against Mariamne; for they\r\nwere suspicious, that when these came to the government, they should be\r\npunished for the wickedness they had been guilty of against their\r\nmother; so they made this very fear of theirs a motive to raise\r\ncalumnies against them also. They gave it out that they were not pleased\r\nwith their father's company, because he had put their mother to death,\r\nas if it were not agreeable to piety to appear to converse with their\r\nmother's murderer. Now, by carrying these stories; that had indeed a\r\ntrue foundation [in the fact], but were only built on probabilities as\r\nto the present accusation, they were able to do them mischief, and to\r\nmake Herod take away that kindness from his sons which he had before\r\nborne to them; for they did not say these things to him openly, but\r\nscattered abroad such words, among the rest of the multitude; from which\r\nwords, when carried to Herod, he was induced [at last] to hate them, and\r\nwhich natural affection itself, even in length of time, was not able to\r\novercome; yet was the king at that time in a condition to prefer the\r\nnatural affection of a father before all the suspicions and calumnies\r\nhis sons lay under. So he respected them as he ought to do, and married\r\nthem to wives, now they were of an age suitable thereto. To Aristobulus\r\nhe gave for a wife Bernice, Salome's daughter; and to Alexander,\r\nGlaphyra, the daughter of Archelaus, king of Cappadocia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How Herod Twice Sailed To Agrippa; And How Upon The Complaint\r\nIn Ionia Against The Greeks Agrippa Confirmed The Laws To Them.\r\n\r\n1. When Herod had despatched these affairs, and he understood that\r\nMarcus Agrippa had sailed again out of Italy into Asia, he made haste to\r\nhim, and besought him to come to him into his kingdom, and to partake of\r\nwhat he might justly expect from one that had been his guest, and was\r\nhis friend. This request he greatly pressed, and to it Agrippa agreed,\r\nand came into Judea; whereupon Herod omitted nothing that might please\r\nhim. He entertained him in his new-built cities, and showed him the\r\nedifices he had built, and provided all sorts of the best and most\r\ncostly dainties for him and his friends, and that at Sebaste and\r\nCæsarea, about that port that he had built, and at the fortresses which\r\nhe had erected at great expenses, Alexandrium, and Herodium, and\r\nHyrcania. He also conducted him to the city Jerusalem, where all the\r\npeople met him in their festival garments, and received him with\r\nacclamations. Agrippa also offered a hecatomb of sacrifices to God; and\r\nfeasted the people, without omitting any of the greatest dainties that\r\ncould be gotten. He also took so much pleasure there, that he abode many\r\ndays with them, and would willingly have staid longer, but that the\r\nseason of the year made him make haste away; for as winter was coming\r\non, he thought it not safe to go to sea later, and yet he was of\r\nnecessity to return again to Ionia.\r\n\r\n2. So Agrippa went away, when Herod had bestowed on him, and on the\r\nprincipal of those that were with him, many presents; but king Herod,\r\nwhen he had passed the winter in his own dominions, made haste to get to\r\nhim again in the spring, when he knew he designed to go to a campaign at\r\nthe Bosphorus. So when he had sailed by Rhodes and by Cos, he touched at\r\nLesbos, as thinking he should have overtaken Agrippa there; but he was\r\ntaken short here by a north wind, which hindered his ship from going to\r\nthe shore; so he continued many days at Chius, and there he kindly\r\ntreated a great many that came to him, and obliged them by giving them\r\nroyal gifts. And when he saw that the portico of the city was fallen\r\ndown, which as it was overthrown in the Mithridatic war, and was very\r\nlarge and fine building, so was it not so easy to rebuild that as it was\r\nthe rest, yet did he furnish a sum not only large enough for that\r\npurpose, but what was more than sufficient to finish the building; and\r\nordered them not to overlook that portico, but to rebuild it quickly,\r\nthat so the city might recover its proper ornaments. And when the high\r\nwinds were laid, he sailed to Mytilene, and thence to Byzantium; and\r\nwhen he heard that Agrippa was sailed beyond the Cyanean rocks, he made\r\nall the haste possible to overtake him, and came up with him about\r\nSinope, in Pontus. He was seen sailing by the ship-men most\r\nunexpectedly, but appeared to their great joy; and many friendly\r\nsalutations there were between them, insomuch that Agrippa thought he\r\nhad received the greatest marks of the king's kindness and humanity\r\ntowards him possible, since the king had come so long a voyage, and at a\r\nvery proper season, for his assistance, and had left the government of\r\nhis own dominions, and thought it more worth his while to come to him.\r\nAccordingly, Herod was all in all to Agrippa, in the management of the\r\nwar, and a great assistant in civil affairs, and in giving him counsel\r\nas to particular matters. He was also a pleasant companion for him when\r\nhe relaxed himself, and a joint partaker with him in all things; ill\r\ntroubles because of his kindness, and in prosperity because of the\r\nrespect Agrippa had for him. Now as soon as those affairs of Pontus were\r\nfinished, for whose sake Agrippa was sent thither, they did not think\r\nfit to return by sea, but passed through Paphlagonia and Cappadocia;\r\nthey then traveled thence over great Phrygia, and came to Ephesus, and\r\nthen they sailed from Ephesus to Samos. And indeed the king bestowed a\r\ngreat many benefits on every city that he came to, according as they\r\nstood in need of them; for as for those that wanted either money or kind\r\ntreatment, he was not wanting to them; but he supplied the former\r\nhimself out of his own expenses: he also became an intercessor with\r\nAgrippa for all such as sought after his favor, and he brought things so\r\nabout, that the petitioners failed in none of their suits to him,\r\nAgrippa being himself of a good disposition, and of great generosity,\r\nand ready to grant all such requests as might be advantageous to the\r\npetitioners, provided they were not to the detriment of others. The\r\ninclination of the king was of great weight also, and still excited\r\nAgrippa, who was himself ready to do good; for he made a reconciliation\r\nbetween the people of Ilium, at whom he was angry, and paid what money\r\nthe people of Chius owed Cæsar's procurators, and discharged them of\r\ntheir tributes; and helped all others, according as their several\r\nnecessities required.\r\n\r\n3. But now, when Agrippa and Herod were in Ionia, a great multitude of\r\nJews, who dwelt in their cities, came to them, and laying hold of the\r\nopportunity and the liberty now given them, laid before them the\r\ninjuries which they suffered, while they were not permitted to use their\r\nown laws, but were compelled to prosecute their law-suits, by the ill\r\nusage of the judges, upon their holy days, and were deprived of the\r\nmoney they used to lay up at Jerusalem, and were forced into the army,\r\nand upon such other offices as obliged them to spend their sacred money;\r\nfrom which burdens they always used to be freed by the Romans, who had\r\nstill permitted them to live according to their own laws. When this\r\nclamor was made, the king desired of Agrippa that he would hear their\r\ncause, and assigned Nicolaus, one of his friends, to plead for those\r\ntheir privileges. Accordingly, when Agrippa had called the principal of\r\nthe Romans, and such of the kings and rulers as were there, to be his\r\nassessors, Nicolaus stood up, and pleaded for the Jews, as follows: \"It\r\nis of necessity incumbent on such as are in distress to have recourse to\r\nthose that have it in their power to free them from those injuries they\r\nlie under; and for those that now are complainants, they approach you\r\nwith great assurance; for as they have formerly often obtained your\r\nfavor, so far as they have even wished to have it, they now only entreat\r\nthat you, who have been the donors, will take care that those favors you\r\nhave already granted them may not be taken away from them. We have\r\nreceived these favors from you, who alone have power to grant them, but\r\nhave them taken from us by such as are no greater than ourselves, and by\r\nsuch as we know are as much subjects as we are; and certainly, if we\r\nhave been vouchsafed great favors, it is to our commendation who have\r\nobtained them, as having been found deserving of such great favors; and\r\nif those favors be but small ones, it would be barbarous for the donors\r\nnot to confirm them to us. And for those that are the hinderance of the\r\nJews, and use them reproachfully, it is evident that they affront both\r\nthe receivers, while they will not allow those to be worthy men to whom\r\ntheir excellent rulers themselves have borne their testimony, and the\r\ndonors, while they desire those favors already granted may be abrogated.\r\nNow if any one should ask these Gentiles themselves, which of the two\r\nthings they would choose to part with, their lives, or the customs of\r\ntheir forefathers, their solemnities, their sacrifices, their festivals,\r\nwhich they celebrated in honor of those they suppose to be gods? I know\r\nvery well that they would choose to suffer any thing whatsoever rather\r\nthan a dissolution of any of the customs of their forefathers; for a\r\ngreat many of them have rather chosen to go to war on that account, as\r\nvery solicitous not to transgress in those matters. And indeed we take\r\nan estimate of that happiness which all mankind do now enjoy by your\r\nmeans from this very thing, that we are allowed every one to worship as\r\nour own institutions require, and yet to live [in peace]; and although\r\nthey would not be thus treated themselves, yet do they endeavor to\r\ncompel others to comply with them, as if it were not as great an\r\ninstance of impiety profanely to dissolve the religious solemnities of\r\nany others, as to be negligent in the observation of their own towards\r\ntheir gods. And let us now consider the one of these practices. Is there\r\nany people, or city, or community of men, to whom your government and\r\nthe Roman power does not appear to be the greatest blessing? Is there\r\nany one that can desire to make void the favors they have granted? No\r\none is certainly so mad; for there are no men but such as have been\r\npartakers of their favors, both public and private; and indeed those\r\nthat take away what you have granted, can have no assurance but every\r\none of their own grants made them by you may be taken from them also;\r\nwhich grants of yours can yet never be sufficiently valued; for if they\r\nconsider the old governments under kings, together with your present\r\ngovernment, besides the great number of benefits which this government\r\nhath bestowed on them, in order to their happiness, this is instead of\r\nall the rest, that they appear to be no longer in a state of slavery,\r\nbut of freedom. Now the privileges we desire, even when we are in the\r\nbest circumstances, are not such as deserve to be envied, for we are\r\nindeed in a prosperous state by your means, but this is only in common\r\nwith others; and it is no more than this which we desire, to preserve\r\nour religion without any prohibition; which as it appears not in itself\r\na privilege to be envied us, so it is for the advantage of those that\r\ngrant it to us; for if the Divinity delights in being honored, it must\r\ndelight in those that permit them to be honored. And there are none of\r\nour customs which are inhuman, but all tending to piety, and devoted to\r\nthe preservation of justice; nor do we conceal those injunctions of ours\r\nby which we govern our lives, they being memorials of piety, and of a\r\nfriendly conversation among men. And the seventh day we set apart from\r\nlabor; it is dedicated to the learning of our customs and laws, 1 we\r\nthinking it proper to reflect on them, as well as on any [good] thing\r\nelse, in order to our avoiding of sin. If any one therefore examine into\r\nour observances, he will find they are good in themselves, and that they\r\nare ancient also, though some think otherwise, insomuch that those who\r\nhave received them cannot easily be brought to depart from them, out of\r\nthat honor they pay to the length of time they have religiously enjoyed\r\nthem and observed them. Now our adversaries take these our privileges\r\naway in the way of injustice; they violently seize upon that money of\r\nours which is owed to God, and called sacred money, and this openly,\r\nafter a sacrilegious manner; and they impose tributes upon us, and bring\r\nus before tribunals on holy days, and then require other like debts of\r\nus, not because the contracts require it, and for their own advantage,\r\nbut because they would put an affront on our religion, of which they are\r\nconscious as well as we, and have indulged themselves in an unjust, and\r\nto them involuntary, hatred; for your government over all is one,\r\ntending to the establishing of benevolence, and abolishing of ill-will\r\namong such as are disposed to it. This is therefore what we implore from\r\nthee, most excellent Agrippa, that we may not be ill-treated; that we\r\nmay not be abused; that we may not be hindered from making use of our\r\nown customs, nor be despoiled of our goods, nor be forced by these men\r\nto do what we ourselves force nobody to do; for these privileges of ours\r\nare not only according to justice, but have formerly been granted us by\r\nyou. And we are able to read to you many decrees of the senate, and the\r\ntables that contain them, which are still extant in the capitol,\r\nconcerning these things, which it is evident were granted after you had\r\nexperience of our fidelity towards you, which ought to be valued, though\r\nno such fidelity had been; for you have hitherto preserved what people\r\nwere in possession of, not to us only, but almost to all men, and have\r\nadded greater advantages than they could have hoped for, and thereby\r\nyour government is become a great advantage to them. And if any one were\r\nable to enumerate the prosperity you have conferred on every nation,\r\nwhich they possess by your means, he could never put an end to his\r\ndiscourse; but that we may demonstrate that we are not unworthy of all\r\nthose advantages we have obtained, it will be sufficient for us, to say\r\nnothing of other things, but to speak freely of this king who now\r\ngoverns us, and is now one of thy assessors; and indeed in what instance\r\nof good-will, as to your house, hath he been deficient? What mark of\r\nfidelity to it hath he omitted? What token of honor hath he not devised?\r\nWhat occasion for his assistance of you hath he not regarded at the very\r\nfirst? What hindereth; therefore, but that your kindnesses may be as\r\nnumerous as his so great benefits to you have been? It may also perhaps\r\nbe fit not here to pass over in silence the valor of his father\r\nAntipater, who, when Cæsar made an expedition into Egypt, assisted him\r\nwith two thousand armed men, and proved inferior to none, neither in the\r\nbattles on land, nor in the management of the navy; and what need I say\r\nany thing of how great weight those soldiers were at that juncture? or\r\nhow many and how great presents they were vouchsafed by Cæsar? And truly\r\nI ought before now to have mentioned the epistles which Cæsar wrote to\r\nthe senate; and how Antipater had honors, and the freedom of the city of\r\nRome, bestowed upon him; for these are demonstrations both that we have\r\nreceived these favors by our own deserts, and do on that account\r\npetition thee for thy confirmation of them, from whom we had reason to\r\nhope for them, though they had not been given us before, both out of\r\nregard to our king's disposition towards you, and your disposition\r\ntowards him. And further, we have been informed by those Jews that were\r\nthere with what kindness thou camest into our country, and how thou\r\nofferedst the most perfect sacrifices to God, and honoredst him with\r\nremarkable vows, and how thou gavest the people a feast, and acceptedst\r\nof their own hospitable presents to thee. We ought to esteem all these\r\nkind entertainments made both by our nation and to our city, to a man\r\nwho is the ruler and manager of so much of the public affairs, as\r\nindications of that friendship which thou hast returned to the Jewish\r\nnation, and which hath been procured them by the family of Herod. So we\r\nput thee in mind of these things in the presence of the king, now\r\nsitting by thee, and make our request for no more but this, that what\r\nyou have given us yourselves you will not see taken away by others from\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n4. When Nicolaus had made this speech, there was no opposition made to\r\nit by the Greeks, for this was not an inquiry made, as in a court of\r\njustice, but an intercession to prevent violence to be offered to the\r\nJews any longer; nor did the Greeks make any defense of themselves, or\r\ndeny what it was supposed they had done. Their pretense was no more than\r\nthis, that while the Jews inhabited in their country, they were entirely\r\nunjust to them [in not joining in their worship] but they demonstrated\r\ntheir generosity in this, that though they worshipped according to their\r\ninstitutions, they did nothing that ought to grieve them. So when\r\nAgrippa perceived that they had been oppressed by violence, he made this\r\nanswer: That, on account of Herod's good-will and friendship, he was\r\nready to grant the Jews whatsoever they should ask him, and that their\r\nrequests seemed to him in themselves just; and that if they requested\r\nany thing further, he should not scruple to grant it them, provided they\r\nwere no way to the detriment of the Roman government; but that while\r\ntheir request was no more than this, that what privileges they had\r\nalready given them might not be abrogated, he confirmed this to them,\r\nthat they might continue in the observation of their own customs,\r\nwithout any one offering them the least injury. And when he had said\r\nthus, he dissolved the assembly; upon which Herod stood up and saluted\r\nhim, and gave him thanks for the kind disposition he showed to them.\r\nAgrippa also took this in a very obliging manner, and saluted him again,\r\nand embraced him in his arms; after which he went away from Lesbos; but\r\nthe king determined to sail from Samos to his own country; and when he\r\nhad taken his leave of Agrippa, he pursued his voyage, and landed at\r\nCæsarea in a few days' time, as having favorable winds; from whence he\r\nwent to Jerusalem, and there gathered all the people together to an\r\nassembly, not a few being there out of the country also. So he came to\r\nthem, and gave them a particular account of all his journey, and of the\r\naffairs of all the Jews in Asia, how by his means they would live\r\nwithout injurious treatment for the time to come. He also told them of\r\nthe entire good fortune he had met with and how he had administered the\r\ngovernment, and had not neglected any thing which was for their\r\nadvantage; and as he was very joyful, he now remitted to them the fourth\r\npart of their taxes for the last year. Accordingly, they were so pleased\r\nwith his favor and speech to them, that they went their ways with great\r\ngladness, and wished the king all manner of happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\nHow Great Disturbances Arose In Herods Family On His Preferring\r\nAntipater His Eldest Son Before The Rest, Till Alexander Took That\r\nInjury Very Heinously.\r\n\r\n1. But now the affairs in Herod's family were in more and more disorder,\r\nand became more severe upon him, by the hatred of Salome to the young\r\nmen [Alexander and Aristobulus], which descended as it were by\r\ninheritance [from their mother Mariamne]; and as she had fully succeeded\r\nagainst their mother, so she proceeded to that degree of madness and\r\ninsolence, as to endeavor that none of her posterity might be left\r\nalive, who might have it in their power to revenge her death. The young\r\nmen had also somewhat of a bold and uneasy disposition towards their\r\nfather occasioned by the remembrance of what their mother had unjustly\r\nsuffered, and by their own affectation of dominion. The old grudge was\r\nalso renewed; and they cast reproaches on Salome and Pheroras, who\r\nrequited the young men with malicious designs, and actually laid\r\ntreacherous snares for them. Now as for this hatred, it was equal on\r\nboth sides, but the manner of exerting that hatred was different; for as\r\nfor the young men, they were rash, reproaching and affronting the others\r\nopenly, and were inexperienced enough to think it the most generous to\r\ndeclare their minds in that undaunted manner; but the others did not\r\ntake that method, but made use of calumnies after a subtle and a\r\nspiteful manner, still provoking the young men, and imagining that their\r\nboldness might in time turn to the offering violence to their father;\r\nfor inasmuch as they were not ashamed of the pretended crimes of their\r\nmother, nor thought she suffered justly, these supposed that might at\r\nlength exceed all bounds, and induce them to think they ought to be\r\navenged on their father, though it were by despatching him with their\r\nown hands. At length it came to this, that the whole city was full of\r\ntheir discourses, and, as is usual in such contests, the unskilfulness\r\nof the young men was pitied; but the contrivance of Salome was too hard\r\nfor them, and what imputations she laid upon them came to be believed,\r\nby means of their own conduct; for they who were so deeply affected with\r\nthe death of their mother, that while they said both she and themselves\r\nwere in a miserable case, they vehemently complained of her pitiable\r\nend, which indeed was truly such, and said that they were themselves in\r\na pitiable case also, because they were forced to live with those that\r\nhad been her murderers, and to be partakers with them.\r\n\r\n2. These disorders increased greatly, and the king's absence abroad had\r\nafforded a fit opportunity for that increase; but as soon as Herod was\r\nreturned, and had made the forementioned speech to the multitude,\r\nPheroras and Salome let fill words immediately as if he were in great\r\ndanger, and as if the young men openly threatened that they would not\r\nspare him any longer, but revenge their mother's death upon him. They\r\nalso added another circumstance, that their hopes were fixed on\r\nArchelaus, the king of Cappadocia, that they should be able by his means\r\nto come to Cæsar, and accuse their father. Upon hearing such things,\r\nHerod was immediately disturbed; and indeed was the more astonished,\r\nbecause the same things were related to him by some others also. He then\r\ncalled to mind his former calamity, and considered that the disorders in\r\nhis family had hindered him from enjoying any comfort from those that\r\nwere dearest to him or from his wife whom he loved so well; and\r\nsuspecting that his future troubles would soon be heavier and greater\r\nthan those that were past, he was in great confusion of mind; for Divine\r\nProvidence had in reality conferred upon him a great many outward\r\nadvantages for his happiness, even beyond his hopes; but the troubles he\r\nhad at home were such as he never expected to have met with, and\r\nrendered him unfortunate; nay, both sorts came upon him to such a degree\r\nas no one could imagine, and made it a doubtful question, whether, upon\r\nthe comparison of both, he ought to have exchanged so great a success of\r\noutward good things for so great misfortunes at home, or whether he\r\nought not to have chosen to avoid the calamities relating to his family,\r\nthough he had, for a compensation, never been possessed of the admired\r\ngrandeur of a kingdom.\r\n\r\n3. As he was thus disturbed and afflicted, in order to depress these\r\nyoung men, he brought to court another of his sons, that was born to him\r\nwhen he was a private man; his name was Antipater; yet did he not then\r\nindulge him as he did afterwards, when he was quite overcome by him, and\r\nlet him do every thing as he pleased, but rather with a design of\r\ndepressing the insolence of the sons of Mariamne, and managing this\r\nelevation of his so, that it might be for a warning to them; for this\r\nbold behavior of theirs [he thought] would not be so great, if they were\r\nonce persuaded that the succession to the kingdom did not appertain to\r\nthem alone, or must of necessity come to them. So he introduced\r\nAntipater as their antagonist, and imagined that he made a good\r\nprovision for discouraging their pride, and that after this was done to\r\nthe young men, there might be a proper season for expecting these to be\r\nof a better disposition; but the event proved otherwise than he\r\nintended, for the young men thought he did them a very great injury; and\r\nas Antipater was a shrewd man, when he had once obtained this degree of\r\nfreedom, and began to expect greater things than he had before hoped\r\nfor, he had but one single design in his head, and that was to distress\r\nhis brethren, and not at all to yield to them the pre-eminence, but to\r\nkeep close to his father, who was already alienated from them by the\r\ncalumnies he had heard about them, and ready to be wrought upon in any\r\nway his zeal against them should advise him to pursue, that he might be\r\ncontinually more and more severe against them. Accordingly, all the\r\nreports that were spread abroad came from him, while he avoided himself\r\nthe suspicion as if those discoveries proceeded from him; but he rather\r\nchose to make use of those persons for his assistants that were\r\nunsuspected, and such as might be believed to speak truth by reason of\r\nthe good-will they bore to the king; and indeed there were already not a\r\nfew who cultivated a friendship with Antipater, in hopes of gaining\r\nsomewhat by him, and these were the men who most of all persuaded Herod,\r\nbecause they appeared to speak thus out of their good-will to him: and\r\nwith these joint accusations, which from various foundations supported\r\none another's veracity, the young men themselves afforded further\r\noccasions to Antipater also; for they were observed to shed tears often,\r\non account of the injury that was offered them, and had their mother in\r\ntheir mouths; and among their friends they ventured to reproach their\r\nfather, as not acting justly by them; all which things were with an evil\r\nintention reserved in memory by Antipater against a proper opportunity;\r\nand when they were told to Herod, with aggravations, increased the\r\ndisorder so much, that it brought a great tumult into the family; for\r\nwhile the king was very angry at imputations that were laid upon the\r\nsons of Mariamne, and was desirous to humble them, he still increased\r\nthe honor that he had bestowed on Antipater, and was at last so overcome\r\nby his persuasions, that he brought his mother to court also. He also\r\nwrote frequently to Cæsar in favor of him, and more earnestly\r\nrecommended him to his care particularly. And when Agrippa was returning\r\nto Rome, after he had finished his ten years' government in Asia. 2\r\nHerod sailed from Judea; and when he met with him, he had none with him\r\nbut Antipater, whom he delivered to Agrippa, that he might take him\r\nalong with him, together with many presents, that so he might become\r\nCæsar's friend, insomuch that things already looked as if he had all his\r\nfather's favor, and that the young men were already entirely rejected\r\nfrom any hopes of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How During Antipater's Abode At Rome, Herod Brought Alexander\r\nAnd Aristobulus Before Cæsar And Accused Them. Alexander's Defense Of\r\nHimself Before Cæsar And Reconciliation To His Father.\r\n\r\n1. And now what happened during Antipater's absence augmented the honor\r\nto which he had been promoted, and his apparent eminence above his\r\nbrethren; for he had made a great figure in Rome, because Herod had sent\r\nrecommendations of him to all his friends there; only he was grieved\r\nthat he was not at home, nor had proper opportunities of perpetually\r\ncalumniating his brethren; and his chief fear was, lest his father\r\nshould alter his mind, and entertain a more favorable opinion of the\r\nsons of Mariamne; and as he had this in his mind, he did not desist from\r\nhis purpose, but continually sent from Rome any such stories as he hoped\r\nmight grieve and irritate his father against his brethren, under\r\npretense indeed of a deep concern for his preservation, but in truth\r\nsuch as his malicious mind dictated, in order to purchase a greater hope\r\nof the succession, which yet was already great in itself: and thus he\r\ndid till he had excited such a degree of anger in Herod, that he was\r\nalready become very ill-disposed towards the young men; but still while\r\nhe delayed to exercise so violent a disgust against them, and that he\r\nmight not either be too remiss or too rash, and so offend, he thought it\r\nbest to sail to Rome, and there accuse his sons before Cæsar, and not\r\nindulge himself in any such crime as might be heinous enough to be\r\nsuspected of impiety. But as he was going up to Rome, it happened that\r\nhe made such haste as to meet with Cæsar at the city Aquilei 3 so when\r\nhe came to the speech of Cæsar, he asked for a time for hearing this\r\ngreat cause, wherein he thought himself very miserable, and presented\r\nhis sons there, and accused them of their mad actions, and of their\r\nattempts against him: That they were enemies to him; and by all the\r\nmeans they were able, did their endeavors to show their hatred to their\r\nown father, and would take away his life, and so obtain his kingdom,\r\nafter the most barbarous manner: that he had power from Cæsar to dispose\r\nof it, not by necessity, but by choice, to him who shall exercise the\r\ngreatest piety towards him; while these my sons are not so desirous of\r\nruling, as they are, upon a disappointment thereof, to expose their own\r\nlife, if so be they may but deprive their father of his life; so wild\r\nand polluted is their mind by time become, out of their hatred to him:\r\nthat whereas he had a long time borne this his misfortune, he was now\r\ncompelled to lay it before Cæsar, and to pollute his ears with such\r\nlanguage, while he himself wants to know what severity they have ever\r\nsuffered from him, or what hardships he hath ever laid upon them to make\r\nthem complain of him; and how they can think it just that he should not\r\nbe lord of that kingdom which he in a long time, and with great danger,\r\nhad gained, and not allow him to keep it and dispose of it to him who\r\nshould deserve best; and this, with other advantages, he proposes as a\r\nreward for the piety of such a one as will hereafter imitate the care he\r\nhath taken of it, and that such a one may gain so great a requital as\r\nthat is: and that it is an impious thing for them to pretend to meddle\r\nwith it beforehand; for he who hath ever the kingdom in his view, at the\r\nsame time reckons upon procuring the death of his father, because\r\notherwise he cannot come at the government: that as for himself, he had\r\nhitherto given them all that he was able, and what was agreeable to such\r\nas are subject to the royal authority, and the sons of a king; what\r\nornaments they wanted, with servants and delicate fare, and had married\r\nthem into the most illustrious families, the one [Aristobulus] to his\r\nsister's daughter, but Alexander to the daughter of king Archelaus; and,\r\nwhat was the greatest favor of all, when their crimes were so very bad,\r\nand he had authority to punish them, yet had he not made use of it\r\nagainst them, but had brought them before Cæsar, their common\r\nbenefactor, and had not used the severity which, either as a father who\r\nhad been impiously abused, or as a king who had been assaulted\r\ntreacherously, he might have done, but made them stand upon a level with\r\nhim in judgment: that, however, it was necessary that all this should\r\nnot be passed over without punishment, nor himself live in the greatest\r\nfears; nay, that it was not for their own advantage to see the light of\r\nthe sun after what they have done, although they should escape at this\r\ntime, since they had done the vilest things, and would certainly suffer\r\nthe greatest punishments that ever were known among mankind.\r\n\r\n2. These were the accusations which Herod laid with great vehemency\r\nagainst his sons before Cæsar. Now the young men, both while he was\r\nspeaking, and chiefly at his concluding, wept, and were in confusion.\r\nNow as to themselves, they knew in their own conscience they were\r\ninnocent; but because they were accused by their father, they were\r\nsensible, as the truth was, that it was hard for them to make their\r\napology, since though they were at liberty to speak their minds freely\r\nas the occasion required, and might with force and earnestness refute\r\nthe accusation, yet was it not now decent so to do. There was therefore\r\na difficulty how they should be able to speak; and tears, and at length\r\na deep groan, followed, while they were afraid, that if they said\r\nnothing, they should seem to be in this difficulty from a consciousness\r\nof guilt,—nor had they any defense ready, by reason of their youth, and\r\nthe disorder they were under; yet was not Cæsar unapprized, when he\r\nlooked upon them in the confusion they were in, that their delay to make\r\ntheir defense did not arise from any consciousness of great enormities,\r\nbut from their unskilfulness and modesty. They were also commiserated by\r\nthose that were there in particular; and they moved their father's\r\naffections in earnest till he had much ado to conceal them.\r\n\r\n3. But when they saw there was a kind disposition arisen both in him and\r\nin Cæsar, and that every one of the rest did either shed tears, or at\r\nleast did all grieve with them, the one of them, whose name was\r\nAlexander, called to his father, and attempted to answer his accusation,\r\nand said, \"O father, the benevolence thou hast showed to us is evident,\r\neven in this very judicial procedure, for hadst thou had any pernicious\r\nintentions about us, thou hadst not produced us here before the common\r\nsavior of all, for it was in thy power, both as a king and as a father,\r\nto punish the guilty; but by thus bringing us to Rome, and making Cæsar\r\nhimself a witness to what is done, thou intimatest that thou intendest\r\nto save us; for no one that hath a design to slay a man will bring him\r\nto the temples, and to the altars; yet are our circumstances still\r\nworse, for we cannot endure to live ourselves any longer, if it be\r\nbelieved that we have injured such a father; nay, perhaps it would be\r\nworse for us to live with this suspicion upon us, that we have injured\r\nhim, than to die without such guilt. And if our open defense may be\r\ntaken to be true, we shall be happy, both in pacifying thee, and in\r\nescaping the danger we are in; but if this calumny so prevails, it is\r\nmore than enough for us that we have seen the sun this day; which why\r\nshould we see, if this suspicion be fixed upon us? Now it is easy to say\r\nof young men, that they desire to reign; and to say further, that this\r\nevil proceeds from the case of our unhappy mother. This is abundantly\r\nsufficient to produce our present misfortune out of the former; but\r\nconsider well, whether such an accusation does not suit all such young\r\nmen, and may not be said of them all promiscuously; for nothing can\r\nhinder him that reigns, if he have children, and their mother be dead,\r\nbut the father may have a suspicion upon all his sons, as intending some\r\ntreachery to him; but a suspicion is not sufficient to prove such an\r\nimpious practice. Now let any man say, whether we have actually and\r\ninsolently attempted any such thing, whereby actions otherwise\r\nincredible use to be made credible? Can any body prove that poison hath\r\nbeen prepared? or prove a conspiracy of our equals, or the corruption of\r\nservants, or letters written against thee? though indeed there are none\r\nof those things but have sometimes been pretended by way of calumny,\r\nwhen they were never done; for a royal family that is at variance with\r\nitself is a terrible thing; and that which thou callest a reward of\r\npiety often becomes, among very wicked men, such a foundation of hope,\r\nas makes them leave no sort of mischief untried. Nor does any one lay\r\nany wicked practices to our charge; but as to calumnies by hearsay, how\r\ncan he put an end to them, who will not hear what we have to say? Have\r\nwe talked with too great freedom? Yes; but not against thee, for that\r\nwould be unjust, but against those that never conceal any thing that is\r\nspoken to them. Hath either of us lamented our mother? Yes; but not\r\nbecause she is dead, but because she was evil spoken of by those that\r\nhad no reason so to do. Are we desirous of that dominion which we know\r\nour father is possessed of? For what reason can we do so? If we already\r\nhave royal honors, as we have, should not we labor in vain? And if we\r\nhave them not, yet are not we in hopes of them? Or supposing that we had\r\nkilled thee, could we expect to obtain thy kingdom? while neither the\r\nearth would let us tread upon it, nor the sea let us sail upon it, after\r\nsuch an action as that; nay, the religion of all your subjects, and the\r\npiety of the whole nation, would have prohibited parricides from\r\nassuming the government, and from entering into that most holy temple\r\nwhich was built by thee 4 But suppose we had made light of other\r\ndangers, can any murderer go off unpunished while Cæsar is alive? We are\r\nthy sons, and not so impious or so thoughtless as that comes to, though\r\nperhaps more unfortunate than is convenient for thee. But in case thou\r\nneither findest any causes of complaint, nor any treacherous designs,\r\nwhat sufficient evidence hast thou to make such a wickedness of ours\r\ncredible? Our mother is dead indeed, but then what befell her might be\r\nan instruction to us to caution, and not an incitement to wickedness. We\r\nare willing to make a larger apology for ourselves; but actions never\r\ndone do not admit of discourse. Nay, we will make this agreement with\r\nthee, and that before Cæsar, the lord of all, who is now a mediator\r\nbetween us, If thou, O father, canst bring thyself, by the evidence of\r\ntruth, to have a mind free from suspicion concerning us let us live,\r\nthough even then we shall live in an unhappy way, for to be accused of\r\ngreat acts of wickedness, though falsely, is a terrible thing; but if\r\nthou hast any fear remaining, continue thou on in thy pious life, we\r\nwill give this reason for our own conduct; our life is not so desirable\r\nto us as to desire to have it, if it tend to the harm of our father who\r\ngave it us.\"\r\n\r\n4. When Alexander had thus spoken, Cæsar, who did not before believe so\r\ngross a calumny, was still more moved by it, and looked intently upon\r\nHerod, and perceived he was a little confounded: the persons there\r\npresent were under an anxiety about the young men, and the fame that was\r\nspread abroad made the king hated, for the very incredibility of the\r\ncalumny, and the commiseration of the flower of youth, the beauty of\r\nbody, which were in the young men, pleaded for assistance, and the more\r\nso on this account, that Alexander had made their defense with dexterity\r\nand prudence; nay, they did not themselves any longer continue in their\r\nformer countenances, which had been bedewed with tears, and cast\r\ndownwards to the ground, but now there arose in them hope of the best;\r\nand the king himself appeared not to have had foundation enough to build\r\nsuch an accusation upon, he having no real evidence wherewith to correct\r\nthem. Indeed he wanted some apology for making the accusation; but\r\nCæsar, after some delay, said, that although the young men were\r\nthoroughly innocent of that for which they were calumniated, yet had\r\nthey been so far to blame, that they had not demeaned themselves towards\r\ntheir father so as to prevent that suspicion which was spread abroad\r\nconcerning them. He also exhorted Herod to lay all such suspicions\r\naside, and to be reconciled to his sons; for that it was not just to\r\ngive any credit to such reports concerning his own children; and that\r\nthis repentance on both sides might still heal those breaches that had\r\nhappened between them, and might improve that their good-will to one\r\nanother, whereby those on both sides, excusing the rashness of their\r\nsuspicions, might resolve to bear a greater degree of affection towards\r\neach other than they had before. After Cæsar had given them this\r\nadmonition, he beckoned to the young men. When therefore they were\r\ndisposed to fall down to make intercession to their father, he took them\r\nup, and embraced them, as they were in tears, and took each of them\r\ndistinctly in his arms, till not one of those that were present, whether\r\nfree-man or slave, but was deeply affected with what they saw. 5\r\n\r\n5. Then did they return thanks to Cæsar, and went away together; and\r\nwith them went Antipater, with an hypocritical pretense that he rejoiced\r\nat this reconciliation. And in the last days they were with Cæsar, Herod\r\nmade him a present of three hundred talents, as he was then exhibiting\r\nshows and largesses to the people of Rome; and Cæsar made him a present\r\nof half the revenue of the copper mines in Cyprus, and committed the\r\ncare of the other half to him, and honored him with other gifts and\r\nincomes; and as to his own kingdom, he left it in his own power to\r\nappoint which of his sons he pleased for his successor, or to distribute\r\nit in parts to every one, that the dignity might thereby come to them\r\nall. And when Herod was disposed to make such a settlement immediately,\r\nCæsar said he would not give him leave to deprive himself, while he was\r\nalive, of the power over his kingdom, or over his sons.\r\n\r\n6. After this, Herod returned to Judea again. But during his absence no\r\nsmall part of his dominion about Trachon had revolted, whom yet the\r\ncommanders he left there had vanquished, and compelled to a submission\r\nagain. Now as Herod was sailing with his sons, and was come over against\r\nCilicia, to [the island] Eleusa, which hath now changed its name for\r\nSebaste, he met with Archelaus, king of Cappadocia, who received him\r\nkindly, as rejoicing that he was reconciled to his sons, and that the\r\naccusation against Alexander, who had married his daughter, was at an\r\nend. They also made one another such presents as it became kings to\r\nmake, From thence Herod came to Judea and to the temple, where he made a\r\nspeech to the people concerning what had been done in this his journey.\r\nHe also discoursed to them about Cæsar's kindness to him, and about as\r\nmany of the particulars he had done as he thought it for his advantage\r\nother people should be acquainted with. At last he turned his speech to\r\nthe admonition of his sons; and exhorted those that lived at court, and\r\nthe multitude, to concord; and informed them that his sons were to reign\r\nafter him; Antipater first, and then Alexander and Aristobulus, the sons\r\nof Mariamne: but he desired that at present they should all have regard\r\nto himself, and esteem him king and lord of all, since he was not yet\r\nhindered by old age, but was in that period of life when he must be the\r\nmost skillful in governing; and that he was not deficient in other arts\r\nof management that might enable him to govern the kingdom well, and to\r\nrule over his children also. He further told the rulers under him, and\r\nthe soldiery, that in case they would look upon him alone, their life\r\nwould be led in a peaceable manner, and they would make one another\r\nhappy. And when he had said this, he dismissed the assembly. Which\r\nspeech was acceptable to the greatest part of the audience, but not so\r\nto them all; for the contention among his sons, and the hopes he had\r\ngiven them, occasioned thoughts and desires of innovations among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How Herod Celebrated The Games That Were To Return Every\r\nFifth Year Upon The Building Of Cæsarea; And How He Built And Adorned\r\nMany Other Places After A Magnificent Manner; And Did Many Other Actions\r\nGloriously\r\n\r\n1. About this time it was that Cæsarea Sebaste, which he had built, was\r\nfinished. The entire building being accomplished: in the tenth year, the\r\nsolemnity of it fell into the twenty-eighth year of Herod's reign, and\r\ninto the hundred and ninety-second olympiad. There was accordingly a\r\ngreat festival and most sumptuous preparations made presently, in order\r\nto its dedication; for he had appointed a contention in music, and games\r\nto be performed naked. He had also gotten ready a great number of those\r\nthat fight single combats, and of beasts for the like purpose; horse\r\nraces also, and the most chargeable of such sports and shows as used to\r\nbe exhibited at Rome, and in other places. He consecrated this combat to\r\nCæsar, and ordered it to be celebrated every fifth year. He also sent\r\nall sorts of ornaments for it out of his own furniture, that it might\r\nwant nothing to make it decent; nay, Julia, Cæsar's wife, sent a great\r\npart of her most valuable furniture [from Rome], insomuch that he had no\r\nwant of any thing. The sum of them all was estimated at five hundred\r\ntalents. Now when a great multitude was come to that city to see the\r\nshows, as well as the ambassadors whom other people sent, on account of\r\nthe benefits they had received from Herod, he entertained them all in\r\nthe public inns, and at public tables, and with perpetual feasts; this\r\nsolemnity having in the day time the diversions of the fights, and in\r\nthe night time such merry meetings as cost vast sums of money, and\r\npublicly demonstrated the generosity of his soul; for in all his\r\nundertakings he was ambitious to exhibit what exceeded whatsoever had\r\nbeen done before of the same kind. And it is related that Cæsar and\r\nAgrippa often said, that the dominions of Herod were too little for the\r\ngreatness of his soul; for that he deserved to have both all the kingdom\r\nof Syria, and that of Egypt also.\r\n\r\n2. After this solemnity and these festivals were over, Herod erected\r\nanother city in the plain called Capharsaba, where he chose out a fit\r\nplace, both for plenty of water and goodness of soil, and proper for the\r\nproduction of what was there planted, where a river encompassed the city\r\nitself, and a grove of the best trees for magnitude was round about it:\r\nthis he named Antipatris, from his father Antipater. He also built upon\r\nanother spot of ground above Jericho, of the same name with his mother,\r\na place of great security and very pleasant for habitation, and called\r\nit Cypros. He also dedicated the finest monuments to his brother\r\nPhasaelus, on account of the great natural affection there had been\r\nbetween them, by erecting a tower in the city itself, not less than the\r\ntower of Pharos, which he named Phasaelus, which was at once a part of\r\nthe strong defenses of the city, and a memorial for him that was\r\ndeceased, because it bare his name. He also built a city of the same\r\nname in the valley of Jericho, as you go from it northward, whereby he\r\nrendered the neighboring country more fruitful by the cultivation its\r\ninhabitants introduced; and this also he called Phasaelus.\r\n\r\n3. But as for his other benefits, it is impossible to reckon them up,\r\nthose which he bestowed on cities, both in Syria and in Greece, and in\r\nall the places he came to in his voyages; for he seems to have\r\nconferred, and that after a most plentiful manner, what would minister\r\nto many necessities, and the building of public works, and gave them the\r\nmoney that was necessary to such works as wanted it, to support them\r\nupon the failure of their other revenues: but what was the greatest and\r\nmost illustrious of all his works, he erected Apollo's temple at Rhodes,\r\nat his own expenses, and gave them a great number of talents of silver\r\nfor the repair of their fleet. He also built the greatest part of the\r\npublic edifices for the inhabitants of Nicopolis, at Actium; 6 and for\r\nthe Antiochinus, the inhabitants of the principal city of Syria, where a\r\nbroad street cuts through the place lengthways, he built cloisters along\r\nit on both sides, and laid the open road with polished stone, and was of\r\nvery great advantage to the inhabitants. And as to the olympic games,\r\nwhich were in a very low condition, by reason of the failure of their\r\nrevenues, he recovered their reputation, and appointed revenues for\r\ntheir maintenance, and made that solemn meeting more venerable, as to\r\nthe sacrifices and other ornaments; and by reason of this vast\r\nliberality, he was generally declared in their inscriptions to be one of\r\nthe perpetual managers of those games.\r\n\r\n4. Now some there are who stand amazed at the diversity of Herod's\r\nnature and purposes; for when we have respect to his magnificence, and\r\nthe benefits which he bestowed on all mankind, there is no possibility\r\nfor even those that had the least respect for him to deny, or not openly\r\nto confess, that he had a nature vastly beneficent; but when any one\r\nlooks upon the punishments he inflicted, and the injuries he did, not\r\nonly to his subjects, but to his nearest relations, and takes notice of\r\nhis severe and unrelenting disposition there, he will be forced to allow\r\nthat he was brutish, and a stranger to all humanity; insomuch that these\r\nmen suppose his nature to be different, and sometimes at contradiction\r\nwith itself; but I am myself of another opinion, and imagine that the\r\noccasion of both these sort of actions was one and the same; for being a\r\nman ambitious of honor, and quite overcome by that passion, he was\r\ninduced to be magnificent, wherever there appeared any hopes of a future\r\nmemorial, or of reputation at present; and as his expenses were beyond\r\nhis abilities, he was necessitated to be harsh to his subjects; for the\r\npersons on whom he expended his money were so many, that they made him a\r\nvery bad procurer of it; and because he was conscious that he was hated\r\nby those under him, for the injuries he did them, he thought it not an\r\neasy thing to amend his offenses, for that it was inconvenient for his\r\nrevenue; he therefore strove on the other side to make their ill- will\r\nan occasion of his gains. As to his own court, therefore, if any one was\r\nnot very obsequious to him in his language, and would not confess\r\nhimself to be his slave, or but seemed to think of any innovation in his\r\ngovernment, he was not able to contain himself, but prosecuted his very\r\nkindred and friends, and punished them as if they were enemies and this\r\nwickedness he undertook out of a desire that he might be himself alone\r\nhonored. Now for this, my assertion about that passion of his, we have\r\nthe greatest evidence, by what he did to honor Cæsar and Agrippa, and\r\nhis other friends; for with what honors he paid his respects to them who\r\nwere his superiors, the same did he desire to be paid to himself; and\r\nwhat he thought the most excellent present he could make another, he\r\ndiscovered an inclination to have the like presented to himself. But now\r\nthe Jewish nation is by their law a stranger to all such things, and\r\naccustomed to prefer righteousness to glory; for which reason that\r\nnation was not agreeable to him, because it was out of their power to\r\nflatter the king's ambition with statues or temples, or any other such\r\nperformances; And this seems to me to have been at once the occasion of\r\nHerod's crimes as to his own courtiers and counselors, and of his\r\nbenefactions as to foreigners and those that had no relation to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. An Embassage In Cyrene And Asia To Cæsar, Concerning The\r\nComplaints They Had To Make Against The Greeks; With Copies Of The\r\nEpistles Which Cæsar And Agrippa Wrote To The Cities For Them.\r\n\r\n1. Now the cities ill-treated the Jews in Asia, and all those also of\r\nthe same nation which lived in Libya, which joins to Cyrene, while the\r\nformer kings had given them equal privileges with the other citizens;\r\nbut the Greeks affronted them at this time, and that so far as to take\r\naway their sacred money, and to do them mischief on other particular\r\noccasions. When therefore they were thus afflicted, and found no end of\r\ntheir barbarous treatment they met with among the Greeks, they sent\r\nambassadors to Cæsar on those accounts, who gave them the same\r\nprivileges as they had before, and sent letters to the same purpose to\r\nthe governors of the provinces, copies of which I subjoin here, as\r\ntestimonials of the ancient favorable disposition the Roman emperors had\r\ntowards us.\r\n\r\n2. \"Cæsar Augustus, high priest and tribune of the people, ordains thus:\r\nSince the nation of the Jews hath been found grateful to the Roman\r\npeople, not only at this time, but in time past also, and chiefly\r\nHyrcanus the high priest, under my father 7 Cæsar the emperor, it seemed\r\ngood to me and my counselors, according to the sentence and oath of the\r\npeople of Rome, that the Jews have liberty to make use of their own\r\ncustoms, according to the law of their forefathers, as they made use of\r\nthem under Hyrcanus the high priest of the Almighty God; and that their\r\nsacred money be not touched, but be sent to Jerusalem, and that it be\r\ncommitted to the care of the receivers at Jerusalem; and that they be\r\nnot obliged to go before any judge on the sabbath day, nor on the day of\r\nthe preparation to it, after the ninth hour. 8 But if any one be caught\r\nstealing their holy books, or their sacred money, whether it be out of\r\nthe synagogue or public school, he shall be deemed a sacrilegious\r\nperson, and his goods shall be brought into the public treasury of the\r\nRomans. And I give order that the testimonial which they have given me,\r\non account of my regard to that piety which I exercise toward all\r\nmankind, and out of regard to Caius Marcus Censorinus, together with the\r\npresent decree, be proposed in that most eminent place which hath been\r\nconsecrated to me by the community of Asia at Ancyra. And if any one\r\ntransgress any part of what is above decreed, he shall be severely\r\npunished.\" This was inscribed upon a pillar in the temple of Cæsar.\r\n\r\n3. \"Cæsar to Norbanus Flaccus, sendeth greeting. Let those Jews, how\r\nmany soever they be, who have been used, according to their ancient\r\ncustom, to send their sacred money to Jerusalem, do the same freely.\"\r\nThese were the decrees of Cæsar.\r\n\r\n4. Agrippa also did himself write after the manner following, on behalf\r\nof the Jews: \"Agrippa, to the magistrates, senate, and people of the\r\nEphesians, sendeth greeting. I will that the care and custody of the\r\nsacred money that is carried to the temple at Jerusalem be left to the\r\nJews of Asia, to do with it according to their ancient custom; and that\r\nsuch as steal that sacred money of the Jews, and fly to a sanctuary,\r\nshall be taken thence and delivered to the Jews, by the same law that\r\nsacrilegious persons are taken thence. I have also written to Sylvanus\r\nthe praetor, that no one compel the Jews to come before a judge on the\r\nsabbath day.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"Marcus Agrippa to the magistrates, senate, and people of Cyrene,\r\nsendeth greeting. The Jews of Cyrene have interceded with me for the\r\nperformance of what Augustus sent orders about to Flavius, the then\r\npraetor of Libya, and to the other procurators of that province, that\r\nthe sacred money may be sent to Jerusalem freely, as hath been their\r\ncustom from their forefathers, they complaining that they are abused by\r\ncertain informers, and under pretense of taxes which were not due, are\r\nhindered from sending them, which I command to be restored without any\r\ndiminution or disturbance given to them. And if any of that sacred money\r\nin the cities be taken from their proper receivers, I further enjoin,\r\nthat the same be exactly returned to the Jews in that place.\"\r\n\r\n6. \"Caius Norbanus Flaccus, proconsul, to the magistrates of the\r\nSardians, sendeth greeting. Cæsar hath written to me, and commanded me\r\nnot to forbid the Jews, how many soever they be, from assembling\r\ntogether according to the custom of their forefathers, nor from sending\r\ntheir money to Jerusalem. I have therefore written to you, that you may\r\nknow that both Cæsar and I would have you act accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n7. Nor did Julius Antonius, the proconsul, write otherwise. \"To the\r\nmagistrates, senate, and people of the Ephesians, sendeth greeting. As I\r\nwas dispensing justice at Ephesus, on the Ides of February, the Jews\r\nthat dwell in Asia demonstrated to me that Augustus and Agrippa had\r\npermitted them to use their own laws and customs, and to offer those\r\ntheir first-fruits, which every one of them freely offers to the Deity\r\non account of piety, and to carry them in a company together to\r\nJerusalem without disturbance. They also petitioned me that I also would\r\nconfirm what had been granted by Augustus and Agrippa by my own\r\nsanction. I would therefore have you take notice, that according to the\r\nwill of Augustus and Agrippa, I permit them to use and do according to\r\nthe customs of their forefathers without disturbance.\"\r\n\r\n8. I have been obliged to set down these decree because the present\r\nhistory of our own acts will go generally among the Greeks; and I have\r\nhereby demonstrated to them that we have formerly been in great esteem,\r\nand have not been prohibited by those governors we were under from\r\nkeeping any of the laws of our forefathers; nay, that we have been\r\nsupported by them, while we followed our own religion, and the worship\r\nwe paid to God; and I frequently make mention of these decrees, in order\r\nto reconcile other people to us, and to take away the causes of that\r\nhatred which unreasonable men bear to us. As for our customs 9 there is\r\nno nation which always makes use of the same, and in every city almost\r\nwe meet with them different from one another; but natural justice is\r\nmost agreeable to the advantage of all men equally, both Greeks and\r\nbarbarians, to which our laws have the greatest regard, and thereby\r\nrender us, if we abide in them after a pure manner, benevolent and\r\nfriendly to all men; on which account we have reason to expect the like\r\nreturn from others, and to inform them that they ought not to esteem\r\ndifference of positive institutions a sufficient cause of alienation,\r\nbut [join with us in] the pursuit of virtue and probity, for this\r\nbelongs to all men in common, and of itself alone is sufficient for the\r\npreservation of human life. I now return to the thread of my history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How, Upon Herod's Going Down Into David's Sepulcher, The\r\nSedition In His Family Greatly Increased.\r\n\r\n1. As for Herod, he had spent vast sums about the cities, both without\r\nand within his own kingdom; and as he had before heard that Hyrcanus,\r\nwho had been king before him, had opened David's sepulcher, and taken\r\nout of it three thousand talents of silver, and that there was a much\r\ngreater number left behind, and indeed enough to suffice all his wants,\r\nhe had a great while an intention to make the attempt; and at this time\r\nhe opened that sepulcher by night, and went into it, and endeavored that\r\nit should not be at all known in the city, but took only his most\r\nfaithful friends with him. As for any money, he found none, as Hyrcanus\r\nhad done, but that furniture of gold, and those precious goods that were\r\nlaid up there; all which he took away. However, he had a great desire to\r\nmake a more diligent search, and to go farther in, even as far as the\r\nvery bodies of David and Solomon; where two of his guards were slain, by\r\na flame that burst out upon those that went in, as the report was. So he\r\nwas terribly affrighted, and went out, and built a propitiatory monument\r\nof that fright he had been in; and this of white stone, at the mouth of\r\nthe sepulcher, and that at great expense also. And even Nicolaus 10 his\r\nhistoriographer makes mention of this monument built by Herod, though he\r\ndoes not mention his going down into the sepulcher, as knowing that\r\naction to be of ill repute; and many other things he treats of in the\r\nsame manner in his book; for he wrote in Herod's lifetime, and under his\r\nreign, and so as to please him, and as a servant to him, touching upon\r\nnothing but what tended to his glory, and openly excusing many of his\r\nnotorious crimes, and very diligently concealing them. And as he was\r\ndesirous to put handsome colors on the death of Mariamne and her sons,\r\nwhich were barbarous actions in the king, he tells falsehoods about the\r\nincontinence of Mariamne, and the treacherous designs of his sons upon\r\nhim; and thus he proceeded in his whole work, making a pompous encomium\r\nupon what just actions he had done, but earnestly apologizing for his\r\nunjust ones. Indeed, a man, as I said, may have a great deal to say by\r\nway of excuse for Nicolaus; for he did not so properly write this as a\r\nhistory for others, as somewhat that might be subservient to the king\r\nhimself. As for ourselves, who come of a family nearly allied to the\r\nAsamonean kings, and on that account have an honorable place, which is\r\nthe priesthood, we think it indecent to say any thing that is false\r\nabout them, and accordingly we have described their actions after an\r\nunblemished and upright manner. And although we reverence many of\r\nHerod's posterity, who still reign, yet do we pay a greater regard to\r\ntruth than to them, and this though it sometimes happens that we incur\r\ntheir displeasure by so doing.\r\n\r\n2. And indeed Herod's troubles in his family seemed to be augmented by\r\nreason of this attempt he made upon David's sepulcher; whether Divine\r\nvengeance increased the calamities he lay under, in order to render them\r\nincurable, or whether fortune made an assault upon him, in those cases\r\nwherein the seasonableness of the cause made it strongly believed that\r\nthe calamities came upon him for his impiety; for the tumult was like a\r\ncivil war in his palace, and their hatred towards one another was like\r\nthat where each one strove to exceed another in calumnies. However,\r\nAntipater used stratagems perpetually against his brethren, and that\r\nvery cunningly; while abroad he loaded them with accusations, but still\r\ntook upon him frequently to apologize for them, that this apparent\r\nbenevolence to them might make him be believed, and forward his attempts\r\nagainst them; by which means he, after various manners, circumvented his\r\nfather, who believed all that he did was for his preservation. Herod\r\nalso recommended Ptolemy, who was a great director of the affairs of his\r\nkingdom, to Antipater; and consulted with his mother about the public\r\naffairs also. And indeed these were all in all, and did what they\r\npleased, and made the king angry against any other persons, as they\r\nthought it might be to their own advantage; but still the sons of\r\nMariamne were in a worse and worse condition perpetually; and while they\r\nwere thrust out, and set in a more dishonorable rank, who yet by birth\r\nwere the most noble, they could not bear the dishonor. And for the\r\nwomen, Glaphyra, Alexander's wife, the daughter of Archelaus, hated\r\nSalome, both because of her love to her husband, and because Glaphyra\r\nseemed to behave herself somewhat insolently towards Salome's daughter,\r\nwho was the wife of Aristobulus, which equality of hers to herself\r\nGlaphyra took very impatiently.\r\n\r\n3. Now, besides this second contention that had fallen among them,\r\nneither did the king's brother Pheroras keep himself out of trouble, but\r\nhad a particular foundation for suspicion and hatred; for he was\r\novercome with the charms of his wife, to such a degree of madness, that\r\nhe despised the king's daughter, to whom he had been betrothed, and\r\nwholly bent his mind to the other, who had been but a servant. Herod\r\nalso was grieved by the dishonor that was done him, because he had\r\nbestowed many favors upon him, and had advanced him to that height of\r\npower that he was almost a partner with him in the kingdom, and saw that\r\nhe had not made him a due return for his labors, and esteemed himself\r\nunhappy on that account. So upon Pheroras's unworthy refusal, he gave\r\nthe damsel to Phasaelus's son; but after some time, when he thought the\r\nheat of his brother's affections was over, he blamed him for his former\r\nconduct, and desired him to take his second daughter, whose name was\r\nCypros. Ptolemy also advised him to leave off affronting his brother,\r\nand to forsake her whom he had loved, for that it was a base thing to be\r\nso enamored of a servant, as to deprive himself of the king's good-will\r\nto him, and become an occasion of his trouble, and make himself hated by\r\nhim. Pheroras knew that this advice would be for his own advantage,\r\nparticularly because he had been accused before, and forgiven; so he put\r\nhis wife away, although he already had a son by her, and engaged to the\r\nking that he would take his second daughter, and agreed that the\r\nthirtieth day after should be the day of marriage; and sware he would\r\nhave no further conversation with her whom he had put away; but when the\r\nthirty days were over, he was such a slave to his affections, that he no\r\nlonger performed any thing he had promised, but continued still with his\r\nformer wife. This occasioned Herod to grieve openly, and made him angry,\r\nwhile the king dropped one word or other against Pheroras perpetually;\r\nand many made the king's anger an opportunity for raising calumnies\r\nagainst him. Nor had the king any longer a single quiet day or hour, but\r\noccasions of one fresh quarrel or another arose among his relations, and\r\nthose that were dearest to him; for Salome was of a harsh temper, and\r\nill-natured to Mariamne's sons; nor would she suffer her own daughter,\r\nwho was the wife of Aristobulus, one of those young men, to bear a good-\r\nwill to her husband, but persuaded her to tell her if he said any thing\r\nto her in private, and when any misunderstandings happened, as is\r\ncommon, she raised a great many suspicions out of it; by which means she\r\nlearned all their concerns, and made the damsel ill-natured to the young\r\nman. And in order to gratify her mother, she often said that the young\r\nmen used to mention Mariamne when they were by themselves; and that they\r\nhated their father, and were continually threatening, that if they had\r\nonce got the kingdom, they would make Herod's sons by his other wives\r\ncountry schoolmasters, for that the present education which was given\r\nthem, and their diligence in learning, fitted them for such an\r\nemployment. And as for the women, whenever they saw them adorned with\r\ntheir mother's clothes, they threatened, that instead of their present\r\ngaudy apparel, they should be clothed in sackcloth, and confined so\r\nclosely that they should not see the light of the sun. These stories\r\nwere presently carried by Salome to the king, who was troubled to hear\r\nthem, and endeavored to make up matters; but these suspicions afflicted\r\nhim, and becoming more and more uneasy, he believed every body against\r\nevery body. However, upon his rebuking his sons, and hearing the defense\r\nthey made for themselves, he was easier for a while, though a little\r\nafterwards much worse accidents came upon him.\r\n\r\n4. For Pheroras came to Alexander, the husband of Glaphyra, who was the\r\ndaughter of Archelaus, as we have already told you, and said that he had\r\nheard from Salome that Herod has enamored on Glaphyra, and that his\r\npassion for her was incurable. When Alexander heard that, he was all on\r\nfire, from his youth and jealousy; and he interpreted the instances of\r\nHerod's obliging behavior to her, which were very frequent, for the\r\nworse, which came from those suspicions he had on account of that word\r\nwhich fell from Pheroras; nor could he conceal his grief at the thing,\r\nbut informed him what word Pheroras had said. Upon which Herod was in a\r\ngreater disorder than ever; and not bearing such a false calumny, which\r\nwas to his shame, was much disturbed at it; and often did he lament the\r\nwickedness of his domestics, and how good he had been to them, and how\r\nill requitals they had made him. So he sent for Pheroras, and reproached\r\nhim, and said, \"Thou vilest of all men! art thou come to that\r\nunmeasurable and extravagant degree of ingratitude, as not only to\r\nsuppose such things of me, but to speak of them? I now indeed perceive\r\nwhat thy intentions are. It is not thy only aim to reproach me, when\r\nthou usest such words to my son, but thereby to persuade him to plot\r\nagainst me, and get me destroyed by poison. And who is there, if he had\r\nnot a good genius at his elbow, as hath my son, but would not bear such\r\na suspicion of his father, but would revenge himself upon him? Dost thou\r\nsuppose that thou hast only dropped a word for him to think of, and not\r\nrather hast put a sword into his hand to slay his father? And what dost\r\nthou mean, when thou really hatest both him and his brother, to pretend\r\nkindness to them, only in order to raise a reproach against me, and talk\r\nof such things as no one but such an impious wretch as thou art could\r\neither devise in their mind, or declare in their words? Begone, thou art\r\nsuch a plague to thy benefactor and thy brother, and may that evil\r\nconscience of thine go along with thee; while I still overcome my\r\nrelations by kindness, and am so far from avenging myself of them, as\r\nthey deserve, that I bestow greater benefits upon them than they are\r\nworthy of.\"\r\n\r\n5. Thus did the king speak. Whereupon Pheroras, who was caught in the\r\nvery act of his villainy, said that \"it was Salome who was the framer of\r\nthis plot, and that the words came from her.\" But as soon as she heard\r\nthat, for she was at hand, she cried out, like one that would be\r\nbelieved, that no such thing ever came out of her mouth; that they all\r\nearnestly endeavored to make the king hate her, and to make her away,\r\nbecause of the good-will she bore to Herod, and because she was always\r\nforeseeing the dangers that were coming upon him, and that at present\r\nthere were more plots against him than usual; for while she was the only\r\nperson who persuaded her brother to put away the wife he now had, and to\r\ntake the king's daughter, it was no wonder if she were hated by him. As\r\nshe said this, and often tore her hair, and often beat her breast, her\r\ncountenance made her denial to be believed; but the peverseness of her\r\nmanners declared at the same time her dissimulation in these\r\nproceedings; but Pheroras was caught between them, and had nothing\r\nplausible to offer in his own defense, while he confessed that he had\r\nsaid what was charged upon him, but was not believed when he said he had\r\nheard it from Salome; so the confusion among them was increased, and\r\ntheir quarrelsome words one to another. At last the king, out of his\r\nhatred to his brother and sister, sent them both away; and when he had\r\ncommended the moderation of his son, and that he had himself told him of\r\nthe report, he went in the evening to refresh himself. After such a\r\ncontest as this had fallen out among them, Salome's reputation suffered\r\ngreatly, since she was supposed to have first raised the calumny; and\r\nthe king's wives were grieved at her, as knowing she was a very ill-\r\nnatured woman, and would sometimes be a friend, and sometimes an enemy,\r\nat different seasons: so they perpetually said one thing or another\r\nagainst her; and somewhat that now fell out made them the bolder in\r\nspeaking against her.\r\n\r\n6. There was one Obodas, king of Arabia, an inactive and slothful man in\r\nhis nature; but Sylleus managed most of his affairs for him. He was a\r\nshrewd man, although he was but young, and was handsome withal. This\r\nSylleus, upon some occasion coming to Herod, and supping with him, saw\r\nSalome, and set his heart upon her; and understanding that she was a\r\nwidow, he discoursed with her. Now because Salome was at this time less\r\nin favor with her brother, she looked upon Sylleus with some passion,\r\nand was very earnest to be married to him; and on the days following\r\nthere appeared many, and those very great, indications of their\r\nagreement together. Now the women carried this news to the king, and\r\nlaughed at the indecency of it; whereupon Herod inquired about it\r\nfurther of Pheroras, and desired him to observe them at supper, how\r\ntheir behavior was one toward another; who told him, that by the signals\r\nwhich came from their heads and their eyes, they both were evidently in\r\nlove. After this, Sylleus the Arabian being suspected, went away, but\r\ncame again in two or three months afterwards, as it were on that very\r\ndesign, and spake to Herod about it, and desired that Salome might be\r\ngiven him to wife; for that his affinity might not be disadvantageous to\r\nhis affairs, by a union with Arabia, the government of which country was\r\nalready in effect under his power, and more evidently would be his\r\nhereafter. Accordingly, when Herod discoursed with his sister about it,\r\nand asked her whether she were disposed to this match, she immediately\r\nagreed to it. But when Sylleus was desired to come over to the Jewish\r\nreligion, and then he should marry her, and that it was impossible to do\r\nit on any other terms, he could not bear that proposal, and went his\r\nway; for he said, that if he should do so, he should be stoned by the\r\nArabs. Then did Pheroras reproach Salome for her incontinency, as did\r\nthe women much more; and said that Sylleus had debauched her. As for\r\nthat damsel which the king had betrothed to his brother Pheroras, but he\r\nhad not taken her, as I have before related, because he was enamored on\r\nhis former wife, Salome desired of Herod she might be given to her son\r\nby Costobarus; which match he was very willing to, but was dissuaded\r\nfrom it by Pheroras, who pleaded that this young man would not be kind\r\nto her, since his father had been slain by him, and that it was more\r\njust that his son, who was to be his successor in the tetrarchy, should\r\nhave her. So he begged his pardon, and persuaded him to do so.\r\nAccordingly the damsel, upon this change of her espousals, was disposal\r\nof to this young man, the son of Pheroras, the king giving for her\r\nportion a hundred talents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. How Herod Took Up Alexander And Bound Him; Whom Yet Archelaus\r\nKing Of Cappadocia Reconciled To His Father Herod Again.\r\n\r\n1. But still the affairs of Herod's family were no better, but\r\nperpetually more troublesome. Now this accident happened, which arose\r\nfrom no decent occasion, but proceeded so far as to bring great\r\ndifficulties upon him. There were certain eunuchs which the king had,\r\nand on account of their beauty was very fond of them; and the care of\r\nbringing him drink was intrusted to one of them; of bringing him his\r\nsupper, to another; and of putting him to bed, to the third, who also\r\nmanaged the principal affairs of the government; and there was one told\r\nthe king that these eunuchs were corrupted by Alexander the king's son\r\nwith great sums of money. And when they were asked whether Alexander had\r\nhad criminal conversation with them, they confessed it, but said they\r\nknew of no further mischief of his against his father; but when they\r\nwere more severely tortured, and were in the utmost extremity, and the\r\ntormentors, out of compliance with Antipater, stretched the rack to the\r\nvery utmost, they said that Alexander bare great ill-will and innate\r\nhatred to his father; and that he told them that Herod despaired to live\r\nmuch longer; and that, in order to cover his great age, he colored his\r\nhair black, and endeavored to conceal what would discover how old he\r\nwas; but that if he would apply himself to him, when he should attain\r\nthe kingdom, which, in spite of his father, could come to no one else,\r\nhe should quickly have the first place in that kingdom under him, for\r\nthat he was now ready to take the kingdom, not only as his birth-right,\r\nbut by the preparations he had made for obtaining it, because a great\r\nmany of the rulers, and a great many of his friends, were of his side,\r\nand those no ill men neither, ready both to do and to suffer whatsoever\r\nshould come on that account.\r\n\r\n2. When Herod heard this confession, he was all over anger and fear,\r\nsome parts seeming to him reproachful, and some made him suspicious of\r\ndangers that attended him, insomuch that on both accounts he was\r\nprovoked, and bitterly afraid lest some more heavy plot was laid against\r\nhim than he should be then able to escape from; whereupon he did not now\r\nmake an open search, but sent about spies to watch such as he suspected,\r\nfor he was now overrun with suspicion and hatred against all about him;\r\nand indulging abundance of those suspicions, in order to his\r\npreservation, he continued to suspect those that were guiltless; nor did\r\nhe set any bounds to himself, but supposing that those who staid with\r\nhim had the most power to hurt him, they were to him very frightful; and\r\nfor those that did not use to come to him, it seemed enough to name them\r\n[to make them suspected], and he thought himself safer when they were\r\ndestroyed. And at last his domestics were come to that pass, that being\r\nno way secure of escaping themselves, they fell to accusing one another,\r\nand imagining that he who first accused another was most likely to save\r\nhimself; yet when any had overthrown others, they were hated; and they\r\nwere thought to suffer justly who unjustly accused others, and they only\r\nthereby prevented their own accusation; nay, they now executed their own\r\nprivate enmities by this means, and when they were caught, they were\r\npunished in the same way. Thus these men contrived to make use of this\r\nopportunity as an instrument and a snare against their enemies; yet when\r\nthey tried it, were themselves caught also in the same snare which they\r\nlaid for others: and the king soon repented of what he had done, because\r\nhe had no clear evidence of the guilt of those whom he had slain; and\r\nyet what was still more severe in him, he did not make use of his\r\nrepentance, in order to leave off doing the like again, but in order to\r\ninflict the same punishment upon their accusers.\r\n\r\n3. And in this state of disorder were the affairs of the palace; and he\r\nhad already told many of his friends directly that they ought not to\r\nappear before him, nor come into the palace; and the reason of this\r\ninjunction was, that [when they were there], he had less freedom of\r\nacting, or a greater restraint on himself on their account; for at this\r\ntime it was that he expelled Andromachus and Gamellus, men who had of\r\nold been his friends, and been very useful to him in the affairs of his\r\nkingdom, and been of advantage to his family, by their embassages and\r\ncounsels; and had been tutors to his sons, and had in a manner the first\r\ndegree of freedom with him. He expelled Andromachus, because his son\r\nDemetrius was a companion to Alexander; and Gamellus, because he knew\r\nthat he wished him well, which arose from his having been with him in\r\nhis youth, when he was at school, and absent at Rome. These he expelled\r\nout of his palace, and was willing enough to have done worse by them;\r\nbut that he might not seem to take such liberty against men of so great\r\nreputation, he contented himself with depriving them of their dignity,\r\nand of their power to hinder his wicked proceedings.\r\n\r\n4. Now it was Antipater who was the cause of all this; who when he knew\r\nwhat a mad and licentious way of acting his father was in, and had been\r\na great while one of his counselors, he hurried him on, and then thought\r\nhe should bring him to do somewhat to purpose, when every one that could\r\noppose him was taken away. When therefore Andromachus and his friends\r\nwere driven away, and had no discourse nor freedom with the king any\r\nlonger, the king, in the first place, examined by torture all whom he\r\nthought to be faithful to Alexander, Whether they knew of any of his\r\nattempts against him; but these died without having any thing to say to\r\nthat matter, which made the king more zealous [after discoveries], when\r\nhe could not find out what evil proceedings he suspected them of. As for\r\nAntipater, he was very sagacious to raise a calumny against those that\r\nwere really innocent, as if their denial was only their constancy and\r\nfidelity [to Alexander], and thereupon provoked Herod to discover by the\r\ntorture of great numbers what attempts were still concealed. Now there\r\nwas a certain person among the many that were tortured, who said that he\r\nknew that the young man had often said, that when he was commended as a\r\ntall man in his body, and a skillful marksman, and that in his other\r\ncommendable exercises he exceeded all men, these qualifications given\r\nhim by nature, though good in themselves, were not advantageous to him,\r\nbecause his father was grieved at them, and envied him for them; and\r\nthat when he walked along with his father, he endeavored to depress and\r\nshorten himself, that he might not appear too tall; and that when he\r\nshot at any thing as he was hunting, when his father was by, he missed\r\nhis mark on purpose, for he knew how ambitious his father was of being\r\nsuperior in such exercises. So when the man was tormented about this\r\nsaying, and had ease given his body after it, he added, that he had his\r\nbrother Aristobulus for his assistance, and contrived to lie in wait for\r\ntheir father, as they were hunting, and kill him; and when they had done\r\nso to fly to Rome, and desire to have the kingdom given them. There were\r\nalso letters of the young man found, written to his brother, wherein he\r\ncomplained that his father did not act justly in giving Antipater a\r\ncountry, whose [yearly] revenues amounted to two hundred talents. Upon\r\nthese confessions Herod presently thought he had somewhat to depend on,\r\nin his own opinion, as to his suspicion about his sons; so he took up\r\nAlexander and bound him: yet did he still continue to be uneasy, and was\r\nnot quite satisfied of the truth of what he had heard; and when he came\r\nto recollect himself, he found that they had only made juvenile\r\ncomplaints and contentions, and that it was an incredible thing, that\r\nwhen his son should have slain him, he should openly go to Rome [to beg\r\nthe kingdom]; so he was desirous to have some surer mark of his son's\r\nwickedness, and was very solicitous about it, that he might not appear\r\nto have condemned him to be put in prison too rashly; so he tortured the\r\nprincipal of Alexander's friends, and put not a few of them to death,\r\nwithout getting any of the things out of them which he suspected. And\r\nwhile Herod was very busy about this matter, and the palace was full of\r\nterror and trouble, one of the younger sort, when he was in the utmost\r\nagony, confessed that Alexander had sent to his friends at Rome, and\r\ndesired that he might be quickly invited thither by Cæsar, and that he\r\ncould discover a plot against him; that Mithridates, the king of\r\nParthia, was joined in friendship with his father against the Romans,\r\nand that he had a poisonous potion ready prepared at Askelori.\r\n\r\n5. To these accusations Herod gave credit, and enjoyed hereby, in his\r\nmiserable case, some sort of consolation, in excuse of his rashness, as\r\nflattering himself with finding things in so bad a condition; but as for\r\nthe poisonous potion, which he labored to find, he could find none. As\r\nfor Alexander, he was very desirous to aggravate the vast misfortunes he\r\nwas under, so he pretended not to deny the accusations, but punished the\r\nrashness of his father with a greater crime of his own; and perhaps he\r\nwas willing to make his father ashamed of his easy belief of such\r\ncalumnies: he aimed especially, if he could gain belief to his story, to\r\nplague him and his whole kingdom; for he wrote four letters, and sent\r\nthem to him, that he did not need to torture any more persons, for he\r\nhad plotted against him; and that he had for his partners Pheroras and\r\nthe most faithful of his friends; and that Salome came in to him by\r\nnight, and that she lay with him whether he would or not; and that all\r\nmen were come to be of one mind, to make away with him as soon as they\r\ncould, and so get clear of the continual fear they were in from him.\r\nAmong these were accused Ptolemy and Sapinnius, who were the most\r\nfaithful friends to the king. And what more can be said, but that those\r\nwho before were the most intimate friends, were become wild beasts to\r\none another, as if a certain madness had fallen upon them, while there\r\nwas no room for defense or refutation, in order to the discovery of the\r\ntruth, but all were at random doomed to destruction; so that some\r\nlamented those that were in prison, some those that were put to death,\r\nand others lamented that they were in expectation of the same miseries;\r\nand a melancholy solitude rendered the kingdom deformed, and quite the\r\nreverse to that happy state it was formerly in. Herod's own life also\r\nwas entirely disturbed; and because he could trust nobody, he was sorely\r\npunished by the expectation of further misery; for he often fancied in\r\nhis imagination that his son had fallen upon him, or stood by him with a\r\nsword in his hand; and thus was his mind night and day intent upon this\r\nthing, and revolved it over and over, no otherwise than if he were under\r\na distraction. And this was the sad condition Herod was now in.\r\n\r\n6. But when Archelaus, king of Cappadocia, heard of the state that Herod\r\nwas in, and being in great distress about his daughter, and the young\r\nman [her husband], and grieving with Herod, as with a man that was his\r\nfriend, on account of so great a disturbance as he was under, he came\r\n[to Jerusalem] on purpose to compose their differences; and when he\r\nfound Herod in such a temper, he thought it wholly unseasonable to\r\nreprove him, or to pretend that he had done any thing rashly, for that\r\nhe should thereby naturally bring him to dispute the point with him, and\r\nby still more and more apologizing for himself to be the more irritated:\r\nhe went, therefore, another way to work, in order to correct the former\r\nmisfortunes, and appeared angry at the young man, and said that Herod\r\nhad been so very mild a man, that he had not acted a rash part at all.\r\nHe also said he would dissolve his daughter's marriage with Alexander,\r\nnor could in justice spare his own daughter, if she were conscious of\r\nany thing, and did not inform Herod of it. When Archelaus appeared to be\r\nof this temper, and otherwise than Herod expected or imagined, and, for\r\nthe main, took Herod's part, and was angry on his account, the king\r\nabated of his harshness, and took occasion from his appearing to have\r\nacted justly hitherto, to come by degrees to put on the affection of a\r\nfather, and was on both sides to be pitied; for when some persons\r\nrefuted the calumnies that were laid on the young man, he was thrown\r\ninto a passion; but when Archelaus joined in the accusation, he was\r\ndissolved into tears and sorrow after an affectionate manner.\r\nAccordingly, he desired that he would not dissolve his son's marriage,\r\nand became not so angry as before for his offenses. So when Archelaus\r\nhad brought him to a more moderate temper, he transferred the calumnies\r\nupon his friends; and said it must be owing to them that so young a man,\r\nand one unacquainted with malice, was corrupted; and he supposed that\r\nthere was more reason to suspect the brother than the soft. Upon which\r\nHerod was very much displeased at Pheroras, who indeed now had no one\r\nthat could make a reconciliation between him and his brother. So when he\r\nsaw that Archelaus had the greatest power with Herod, he betook himself\r\nto him in the habit of a mourner, and like one that had all the signs\r\nupon him of an undone man. Upon this Archelaus did not overlook the\r\nintercession he made to him, nor yet did he undertake to change the\r\nking's disposition towards him immediately; and he said that it was\r\nbetter for him to come himself to the king, and confess himself the\r\noccasion of all; that this would make the king's anger not to be\r\nextravagant towards him, and that then he would be present to assist\r\nhim. When he had persuaded him to this, he gained his point with both of\r\nthem; and the calumnies raised against the young man were, beyond all\r\nexpectation, wiped off. And Archelaus, as soon as he had made the\r\nreconciliation, went then away to Cappadocia, having proved at this\r\njuncture of time the most acceptable person to Herod in the world; on\r\nwhich account he gave him the richest presents, as tokens of his\r\nrespects to him; and being on other occasions magnanimous, he esteemed\r\nhim one of his dearest friends. He also made an agreement with him that\r\nhe would go to Rome, because he had written to Cæsar about these\r\naffairs; so they went together as far as Antioch, and there Herod made a\r\nreconciliation between Archelaus and Titus, the president of Syria, who\r\nhad been greatly at variance, and so returned back to Judea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. Concerning The Revolt Of The Trachonites; How Sylleus Accused\r\nHerod Before Cæsar; And How Herod, When Cæsar Was Angry At Him, Resolved\r\nTo Send Nicolaus To Rome.\r\n\r\n1. When Herod had been at Rome, and was come back again, a war arose\r\nbetween him and the Arabians, on the occasion following: The inhabitants\r\nof Trachonitis, after Cæsar had taken the country away from Zenodorus,\r\nand added it to Herod, had not now power to rob, but were forced to\r\nplough the land, and to live quietly, which was a thing they did not\r\nlike; and when they did take that pains, the ground did not produce much\r\nfruit for them. However, at the first the king would not permit them to\r\nrob, and so they abstained from that unjust way of living upon their\r\nneighbors, which procured Herod a great reputation for his care. But\r\nwhen he was sailing to Rome, it was at that time when he went to accuse\r\nhis son Alexander, and to commit Antipater to Cæsar's protection, the\r\nTrachonites spread a report as if he were dead, and revolted from his\r\ndominion, and betook themselves again to their accustomed way of robbing\r\ntheir neighbors; at which time the king's commanders subdued them during\r\nhis absence; but about forty of the principal robbers, being terrified\r\nby those that had been taken, left the country, and retired into Arabia,\r\nSylleus entertaining them, after he had missed of marrying Salome, and\r\ngave them a place of strength, in which they dwelt. So they overran not\r\nonly Judea, but all Celesyria also, and carried off the prey, while\r\nSylleus afforded them places of protection and quietness during their\r\nwicked practices. But when Herod came back from Rome, he perceived that\r\nhis dominions had greatly suffered by them; and since he could not reach\r\nthe robbers themselves, because of the secure retreat they had in that\r\ncountry, and which the Arabian government afforded them, and yet being\r\nvery uneasy at the injuries they had done him, he went all over\r\nTrachonitis, and slew their relations; whereupon these robbers were more\r\nangry than before, it being a law among them to be avenged on the\r\nmurderers of their relations by all possible means; so they continued to\r\ntear and rend every thing under Herod's dominion with impunity. Then did\r\nhe discourse about these robberies to Saturninus and Volumnius, and\r\nrequired that they should be punished; upon which occasion they still\r\nthe more confirmed themselves in their robberies, and became more\r\nnumerous, and made very great disturbances, laying waste the countries\r\nand villages that belonged to Herod's kingdom, and killing those men\r\nwhom they caught, till these unjust proceedings came to be like a real\r\nwar, for the robbers were now become about a thousand;—at which Herod\r\nwas sore displeased, and required the robbers, as well as the money\r\nwhich he had lent Obodas, by Sylleus, which was sixty talents, and since\r\nthe time of payment was now past, he desired to have it paid him; but\r\nSylleus, who had laid Obodas aside, and managed all by himself, denied\r\nthat the robbers were in Arabia, and put off the payment of the money;\r\nabout which there was a hearing before Saturninus and Volumnius, who\r\nwere then the presidents of Syria. 11 At last he, by their means,\r\nagreed, that within thirty days' time Herod should be paid his money,\r\nand that each of them should deliver up the other's subjects\r\nreciprocally. Now, as to Herod, there was not one of the other's\r\nsubjects found in his kingdom, either as doing any injustice, or on any\r\nother account, but it was proved that the Arabians had the robbers\r\namongst them.\r\n\r\n2. When this day appointed for payment of the money was past, without\r\nSylleus's performing any part of his agreement, and he was gone to Rome,\r\nHerod demanded the payment of the money, and that the robbers that were\r\nin Arabia should be delivered up; and, by the permission of Saturninus\r\nand Volumnius, executed the judgment himself upon those that were\r\nrefractory. He took an army that he had, and let it into Arabia, and in\r\nthree days' time marched seven mansions; and when he came to the\r\ngarrison wherein the robbers were, he made an assault upon them, and\r\ntook them all, and demolished the place, which was called Raepta, but\r\ndid no harm to any others. But as the Arabians came to their assistance,\r\nunder Naceb their captain, there ensued a battle, wherein a few of\r\nHerod's soldiers, and Naceb, the captain of the Arabians, and about\r\ntwenty of his soldiers, fell, while the rest betook themselves to\r\nflight. So when he had brought these to punishment, he placed three\r\nthousand Idumeans in Trachonitis, and thereby restrained the robbers\r\nthat were there. He also sent an account to the captains that were about\r\nPhoenicia, and demonstrated that he had done nothing but what he ought\r\nto do, in punishing the refractory Arabians, which, upon an exact\r\ninquiry, they found to be no more than what was true.\r\n\r\n3. However, messengers were hasted away to Sylleus to Rome, and informed\r\nhim what had been done, and, as is usual, aggravated every thing. Now\r\nSylleus had already insinuated himself into the knowledge of Cæsar, and\r\nwas then about the palace; and as soon as he heard of these things, he\r\nchanged his habit into black, and went in, and told Cæsar that Arabia\r\nwas afflicted with war, and that all his kingdom was in great confusion,\r\nupon Herod's laying it waste with his army; and he said, with tears in\r\nhis eyes, that two thousand five hundred of the principal men among the\r\nArabians had been destroyed, and that their captain Nacebus, his\r\nfamiliar friend and kinsman, was slain; and that the riches that were at\r\nRaepta were carried off; and that Obodas was despised, whose infirm\r\nstate of body rendered him unfit for war; on which account neither he,\r\nnor the Arabian army, were present. When Sylleus said so, and added\r\ninvidiously, that he would not himself have come out of the country,\r\nunless he had believed that Cæsar would have provided that they should\r\nall have peace one with another, and that, had he been there, he would\r\nhave taken care that the war should not have been to Herod's advantage;\r\nCæsar was provoked when this was said, and asked no more than this one\r\nquestion, both of Herod's friends that were there, and of his own\r\nfriends, who were come from Syria, Whether Herod had led an army\r\nthither? And when they were forced to confess so much, Cæsar, without\r\nstaying to hear for what reason he did it, and how it was done, grew\r\nvery angry, and wrote to Herod sharply. The sum of his epistle was this,\r\nthat whereas of old he had used him as his friend, he should now use him\r\nas his subject. Sylleus also wrote an account of this to the Arabians,\r\nwho were so elevated with it, that they neither delivered up the robbers\r\nthat had fled to them, nor paid the money that was due; they retained\r\nthose pastures also which they had hired, and kept them without paying\r\ntheir rent, and all this because the king of the Jews was now in a low\r\ncondition, by reason of Cæsar's anger at him. Those of Trachonitis also\r\nmade use of this opportunity, and rose up against the Idumean garrison,\r\nand followed the same way of robbing with the Arabians, who had pillaged\r\ntheir country, and were more rigid in their unjust proceedings, not only\r\nin order to get by it, but by way of revenge also.\r\n\r\n4. Now Herod was forced to bear all this, that confidence of his being\r\nquite gone with which Cæsar's favor used to inspire him; for Cæsar would\r\nnot admit so much as an embassage from him to 'make an apology for him;\r\nand when they came again, he sent them away without success. So he was\r\ncast into sadness and fear; and Sylleus's circumstances grieved him\r\nexceedingly, who was now believed by Cæsar, and was present at Rome,\r\nnay, sometimes aspiring higher. Now it came to pass that Obodas was\r\ndead; and Aeneas, whose name was afterward changed to Aretas, 12 took\r\nthe government, for Sylleus endeavored by calumnies to get him turned\r\nout of his principality, that he might himself take it; with which\r\ndesign he gave much money to the courtiers, and promised much money to\r\nCæsar, who indeed was angry that Aretas had not sent to him first before\r\nhe took the kingdom; yet did Aeneas send an epistle and presents to\r\nCæsar, and a golden crown, of the weight of many talents. Now that\r\nepistle accused Sylleus as having been a wicked servant, and having\r\nkilled Obodas by poison; and that while he was alive, he had governed\r\nhim as he pleased; and had also debauched the wives of the Arabians; and\r\nhad borrowed money, in order to obtain the dominion for himself: yet did\r\nnot Cæsar give heed to these accusations, but sent his ambassadors back,\r\nwithout receiving any of his presents. But in the mean time the affairs\r\nof Judea and Arabia became worse and worse, partly because of the\r\nanarchy they were under, and partly because, as bad as they were, nobody\r\nhad power to govern them; for of the two kings, the one was not yet\r\nconfirmed in his kingdom, and so had not authority sufficient to\r\nrestrain the evil-doers; and as for Herod, Cæsar was immediately angry\r\nat him for having avenged himself, and so he was compelled to bear all\r\nthe injuries that were offered him. At length, when he saw no end of the\r\nmischief which surrounded him, he resolved to send ambassadors to Rome\r\nagain, to see whether his friends had prevailed to mitigate Cæsar, and\r\nto address themselves to Cæsar himself; and the ambassador he sent\r\nthither was Nicolans of Damascus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. How Eurycles Falsely Accused Herod's Sons; And How Their\r\nFather Bound Them, And Wrote To Cæsar About Them. Of Sylleus And How He\r\nWas Accused By Nicolaus.\r\n\r\n1. The disorders about Herod's family and children about this time grew\r\nmuch worse; for it now appeared certain, nor was it unforeseen before-\r\nhand, that fortune threatened the greatest and most insupportable\r\nmisfortunes possible to his kingdom. Its progress and augmentation at\r\nthis time arose on the occasion following: One Eurycles, a Lacedemonian,\r\n[a person of note there, but a man of a perverse mind, and so cunning in\r\nhis ways of voluptuousness and flattery, as to indulge both, and yet\r\nseem to indulge neither of them,] came in his travels to Herod, and made\r\nhim presents, but so that he received more presents from him. He also\r\ntook such proper seasons for insinuating himself into his friendship,\r\nthat he became one of the most intimate of the king's friends. He had\r\nhis lodging in Antipater's house; but he had not only access, but free\r\nconversation, with Alexander, as pretending to him that he was in great\r\nfavor with Archelaus, the king of Cappadocia; whence he pretended much\r\nrespect to Glaphyra, and in an occult manner cultivated a friendship\r\nwith them all; but always attending to what was said and done, that he\r\nmight be furnished with calumnies to please them all. In short, he\r\nbehaved himself so to every body in his conversation, as to appear to be\r\nhis particular friend, and he made others believe that his being any\r\nwhere was for that person's advantage. So he won upon Alexander, who was\r\nbut young; and persuaded him that he might open his grievances to him\r\nwith assurance and with nobody else. So he declared his grief to him,\r\nhow his father was alienated from him. He related to him also the\r\naffairs of his mother, and of Antipater; that he had driven them from\r\ntheir proper dignity, and had the power over every thing himself; that\r\nno part of this was tolerable, since his father was already come to hate\r\nthem; and he added, that he would neither admit them to his table, nor\r\nto his conversation. Such were the complaints, as was but natural, of\r\nAlexander about the things that troubled him; and these discourses\r\nEurycles carried to Antipater, and told him he did not inform him of\r\nthis on his own account, but that being overcome by his kindness, the\r\ngreat importance of the thing obliged him to do it; and he warned him to\r\nhave a care of Alexander, for that what he said was spoken with\r\nvehemency, and that, in consequence of what he said, he would certainly\r\nkill him with his own hand. Whereupon Antipater, thinking him to be his\r\nfriend by this advice, gave him presents upon all occasions, and at\r\nlength persuaded him to inform Herod of what he had heard. So when he\r\nrelated to the king Alexander's ill temper, as discovered by the words\r\nhe had heard him speak, he was easily believed by him; and he thereby\r\nbrought the king to that pass, turning him about by his words, and\r\nirritating him, till he increased his hatred to him and made him\r\nimplacable, which he showed at that very time, for he immediately gave\r\nEurycles a present of fifty talents; who, when he had gotten them, went\r\nto Archelaus, king of Cappadocia, and commended Alexander before him,\r\nand told him that he had been many ways of advantage to him, in making a\r\nreconciliation between him and his father. So he got money from him\r\nalso, and went away, before his pernicious practices were found out; but\r\nwhen Eurycles was returned to Lacedemon, he did not leave off doing\r\nmischief; and so, for his many acts of injustice, he was banished from\r\nhis own country.\r\n\r\n2. But as for the king of the Jews, he was not now in the temper he was\r\nin formerly towards Alexander and Aristobulus, when he had been content\r\nwith the hearing their calumnies when others told him of them; but he\r\nwas now come to that pass as to hate them himself, and to urge men to\r\nspeak against them, though they did not do it of themselves. He also\r\nobserved all that was said, and put questions, and gave ear to every one\r\nthat would but speak, if they could but say any thing against them, till\r\nat length he heard that Euaratus of Cos was a conspirator with\r\nAlexander; which thing to Herod was the most agreeable and sweetest news\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\n3. But still a greater misfortune came upon the young men; while the\r\ncalumnies against them were continually increased, and, as a man may\r\nsay, one would think it was every one's endeavor to lay some grievous\r\nthing to their charge, which might appear to be for the king's\r\npreservation. There were two guards of Herod's body, who were in great\r\nesteem for their strength and tallness, Jucundus and Tyrannus; these men\r\nhad been cast off by Herod, who was displeased at them; these now used\r\nto ride along with Alexander, and for their skill in their exercises\r\nwere in great esteem with him, and had some gold and other gifts\r\nbestowed on them. Now the king having an immediate suspicion of those\r\nmen, had them tortured, who endured the torture courageously for a long\r\ntime; but at last confessed that Alexander would have persuaded them to\r\nkill Herod, when he was in pursuit of the wild beasts, that it might be\r\nsaid he fell from his horse, and was run through with his own spear, for\r\nthat he had once such a misfortune formerly. They also showed where\r\nthere was money hidden in the stable under ground; and these convicted\r\nthe king's chief hunter, that he had given the young men the royal\r\nhunting spears and weapons to Alexander's dependents, at Alexander's\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\n4. After these, the commander of the garrison of Alexandrium was caught\r\nand tortured; for he was accused to have promised to receive the young\r\nmen into his fortress, and to supply them with that money of the king's\r\nwhich was laid up in that fortress, yet did not he acknowledge any thing\r\nof it himself; but his son came ill, and said it was so, and delivered\r\nup the writing, which, so far as could be guessed, was in Alexander's\r\nhand. Its contents were these: \"When we have finished, by God's help,\r\nall that we have proposed to do, we will come to you; but do your\r\nendeavors, as you have promised, to receive us into your fortress.\"\r\nAfter this writing was produced, Herod had no doubt about the\r\ntreacherous designs of his sons against him. But Alexander said that\r\nDiophantus the scribe had imitated his hand, and that the paper was\r\nmaliciously drawn up by Antipater; for Diophantus appeared to be very\r\ncunning in such practices; and as he was afterward convicted of forging\r\nother papers, he was put to death for it.\r\n\r\n5. So the king produced those that had been tortured before the\r\nmultitude at Jericho, in order to have them accuse the young men, which\r\naccusers many of the people stoned to death; and when they were going to\r\nkill Alexander and Aristobulus likewise, the king would not permit them\r\nto do so, but restrained the multitude, by the means of Ptolemy and\r\nPheroras. However, the young men were put under a guard, and kept in\r\ncustody, that nobody might come at them; and all that they did or said\r\nwas watched, and the reproach and fear they were in was little or\r\nnothing different from those of condemned criminals: and one of them,\r\nwho was Aristobulus, was so deeply affected, that he brought Salome, who\r\nwas his aunt, and his mother-in-law, to lament with him for his\r\ncalamities, and to hate him who had suffered things to come to that\r\npass; when he said to her, \"Art thou not in danger of destruction also,\r\nwhile the report goes that thou hadst disclosed beforehand all our\r\naffairs to Syllcus, when thou wast in hopes of being married to him?\"\r\nBut she immediately carried these words to her brother. Upon this he was\r\nout of patience, and gave command to bind him; and enjoined them both,\r\nnow they were kept separate one from the other, to write down the ill\r\nthings they had done against their father, and bring the writings to\r\nhim, So when this was enjoined them, they wrote this, that they had laid\r\nno treacherous designs, nor made any preparations against their father,\r\nbut that they had intended to fly away; and that by the distress they\r\nwere in, their lives being now uncertain and tedious to them.\r\n\r\n6. About this time there came an ambassador out of Cappadocia from\r\nArchelaus, whose name was Melas; he was one of the principal rulers\r\nunder him. So Herod, being desirous to show Archelaus's ill-will to him,\r\ncalled for Alexander, as he was in his bonds, and asked him again\r\nconcerning his fight, whether and how they had resolved to retire\r\nAlexander replied, To Archelaus, who had promised to send them away to\r\nRome; but that they had no wicked nor mischievous designs against their\r\nfather, and that nothing of that nature which their adversaries had\r\ncharged upon them was true; and that their desire was, that he might\r\nhave examined Tyrannus and Jucundus more strictly, but that they had\r\nbeen suddenly slain by the means of Antipater, who put his own friends\r\namong the multitude [for that purpose].\r\n\r\n7. When this was said, Herod commanded that both Alexander and Melas\r\nshould be carried to Glaphyra, Archelaus's daughter, and that she should\r\nbe asked, whether she did not know somewhat of Alexander's treacherous\r\ndesigns against Herod? Now as soon as they were come to her, and she saw\r\nAlexander in bonds, she beat her head, and in a great consternation gave\r\na deep and moving groan. The young man also fell into tears. This was so\r\nmiserable a spectacle to those present, that, for a great while, they\r\nwere not able to say or to do any thing; but at length Ptolemy, who was\r\nordered to bring Alexander, bid him say whether his wife was conscious\r\nof his actions. He replied, \"How is it possible that she, whom I love\r\nbetter than my own soul, and by whom I have had children, should not\r\nknow what I do?\" Upon which she cried out that she knew of no wicked\r\ndesigns of his; but that yet, if her accusing herself falsely would tend\r\nto his preservation, she would confess it all. Alexander replied, \"There\r\nis no such wickedness as those [who ought the least of all so to do]\r\nsuspect, which either I have imagined, or thou knowest of, but this\r\nonly, that we had resolved to retire to Archelaus, and from thence to\r\nRome.\" Which she also confessed. Upon which Herod, supposing that\r\nArchelaus's ill-will to him was fully proved, sent a letter by Olympus\r\nand Volumnius; and bid them, as they sailed by, to touch at Eleusa of\r\nCilicia, and give Archelaus the letter. And that when they had ex-\r\npostulated with him, that he had a hand in his son's treacherous design\r\nagainst him, they should from thence sail to Rome; and that, in case\r\nthey found Nicolaus had gained any ground, and that Cæsar was no longer\r\ndispleased at him, he should give him his letters, and the proofs which\r\nhe had ready to show against the young men. As to Archelaus, he made his\r\ndefense for himself, that he had promised to receive the young men,\r\nbecause it was both for their own and their father's advantage so to do,\r\nlest some too severe procedure should be gone upon in that anger and\r\ndisorder they were in on occasion of the present suspicions; but that\r\nstill he had not promised to send them to Cæsar; and that he had not\r\npromised any thing else to the young men that could show any ill-will to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n8. When these ambassadors were come to Rome, they had a fit opportunity\r\nof delivering their letters to Cæsar, because they found him reconciled\r\nto Herod; for the circumstances of Nicolaus's embassage had been as\r\nfollows: As soon as he was come to Rome, and was about the court, he did\r\nnot first of all set about what he was come for only, but he thought fit\r\nalso to accuse Sylleus. Now the Arabians, even before he came to talk\r\nwith them, were quarrelling one with another; and some of them left\r\nSylleus's party, and joining themselves to Nicolaus, informed him of all\r\nthe wicked things that had been done; and produced to him evident\r\ndemonstrations of the slaughter of a great number of Obodas's friends by\r\nSylleus; for when these men left Sylleus, they had carried off with them\r\nthose letters whereby they could convict him. When Nicolaus saw such an\r\nopportunity afforded him, he made use of it, in order to gain his own\r\npoint afterward, and endeavored immediately to make a reconciliation\r\nbetween Cæsar and Herod; for he was fully satisfied, that if he should\r\ndesire to make a defense for Herod directly, he should not be allowed\r\nthat liberty; but that if he desired to accuse Sylleus, there would an\r\noccasion present itself of speaking on Herod's behalf. So when the cause\r\nwas ready for a hearing, and the day was appointed, Nicolaus, while\r\nAretas's ambassadors were present, accused Sylleus, and said that he\r\nimputed to him the destruction of the king [Obodas], and of many others\r\nof the Arabians; that he had borrowed money for no good design; and he\r\nproved that he had been guilty of adultery, not only with the Arabian,\r\nbut Reinan women also. And he added, that above all the rest he had\r\nalienated Cæsar from Herod, and that all that he had said about the\r\nactions of Herod were falsities. When Nicolaus was come to this topic,\r\nCæsar stopped him from going on, and desired him only to speak to this\r\naffair of Herod, and to show that he had not led an army into Arabia,\r\nnor slain two thousand five hundred men there, nor taken prisoners, nor\r\npillaged the country. To which Nicolaus made this answer: \"I shall\r\nprincipally demonstrate, that either nothing at all, or but a very\r\nlittle, of those imputations are true, of which thou hast been informed;\r\nfor had they been true, thou mightest justly have been still more angry\r\nat Herod.\" At this strange assertion Cæsar was very attentive; and\r\nNicolaus said that there was a debt due to Herod of five hundred\r\ntalents, and a bond, wherein it was written, that if the time appointed\r\nbe lapsed, it should be lawful to make a seizure out of any part of his\r\ncountry. \"As for the pretended army,\" he said, \"it was no army, but a\r\nparty sent out to require the just payment of the money; that this was\r\nnot sent immediately, nor so soon as the bond allowed, but that Sylleus\r\nhad frequently come before Saturninus and Volumnius, the presidents of\r\nSyria; and that at last he had sworn at Berytus, by thy fortune, 13 that\r\nhe would certainly pay the money within thirty days, and deliver up the\r\nfugitives that were under his dominion. And that when Sylleus had\r\nperformed nothing of this, Herod came again before the presidents; and\r\nupon their permission to make a seizure for his money, he, with\r\ndifficulty, went out of his country with a party of soldiers for that\r\npurpose. And this is all the war which these men so tragically describe;\r\nand this is the affair of the expedition into Arabia. And how can this\r\nbe called a war, when thy presidents permitted it, the covenants allowed\r\nit, and it was not executed till thy name, O Cæsar, as well as that of\r\nthe other gods, had been profaned? And now I must speak in order about\r\nthe captives. There were robbers that dwelt in Trachonitis; at first\r\ntheir number was no more than forty, but they became more afterwards,\r\nand they escaped the punishment Herod would have inflicted on them, by\r\nmaking Arabia their refuge. Sylleus received them, and supported them\r\nwith food, that they might be mischievous to all mankind, and gave them\r\na country to inhabit, and himself received the gains they made by\r\nrobbery; yet did he promise that he would deliver up these men, and that\r\nby the same oaths and same time that he sware and fixed for payment of\r\nhis debt: nor can he by any means show that any other persons have at\r\nthis time been taken out of Arabia besides these, and indeed not all\r\nthese neither, but only so many as could not conceal themselves. And\r\nthus does the calumny of the captives, which hath been so odiously\r\nrepresented, appear to be no better than a fiction and a lie, made on\r\npurpose to provoke thy indignation; for I venture to affirm that when\r\nthe forces of the Arabians came upon us, and one or two of Herod's party\r\nfell, he then only defended himself, and there fell Nacebus their\r\ngeneral, and in all about twenty-five others, and no more; whence\r\nSylleus, by multiplying every single soldier to a hundred, he reckons\r\nthe slain to have been two thousand five hundred.\"\r\n\r\n9. This provoked Cæsar more than ever. So he turned to Sylleus full of\r\nrage, and asked him how many of the Arabians were slain. Hereupon he\r\nhesitated, and said he had been imposed upon. The covenants also were\r\nread about the money he had borrowed, and the letters of the presidents\r\nof Syria, and the complaints of the several cities, so many as had been\r\ninjured by the robbers. The conclusion was this, that Sylleus was\r\ncondemned to die, and that Cæsar was reconciled to Herod, and owned his\r\nrepentance for what severe things he had written to him, occasioned by\r\ncalumny, insomuch that he told Sylleus, that he had compelled him, by\r\nhis lying account of things, to be guilty of ingratitude against a man\r\nthat was his friend. At the last all came to this, Sylleus was sent away\r\nto answer Herod's suit, and to repay the debt that he owed, and after\r\nthat to be punished [with death]. But still Cæsar was offended with\r\nAretas, that he had taken upon himself the government, without his\r\nconsent first obtained, for he had determined to bestow Arabia upon\r\nHerod; but that the letters he had sent hindered him from so doing; for\r\nOlympus and Volumnius, perceiving that Cæsar was now become favorable to\r\nHerod, thought fit immediately to deliver him the letters they were\r\ncommanded by Herod to give him concerning his sons. When Cæsar had read\r\nthem, he thought it would not be proper to add another government to\r\nhim, now he was old, and in an ill state with relation to his sons, so\r\nhe admitted Aretas's ambassadors; and after he had just reproved him for\r\nhis rashness, in not tarrying till he received the kingdom from him, he\r\naccepted of his presents, and confirmed him in his government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. How Herod, By Permission From Cæsar Accused His Sons Before\r\nAn Assembly Of Judges At Berytus; And What Tero Suffered For Using A\r\nBoundless And Military Liberty Of Speech. Concerning Also The Death Of\r\nThe Young Men And Their Burial At\r\n\r\nAlexandrium.\r\n\r\nSo Cæsar was now reconciled to Herod, and wrote thus to him: That he was\r\ngrieved for him on account of his sons; and that in case they had been\r\nguilty of any profane and insolent crimes against him, it would behoove\r\nhim to punish them as parricides, for which he gave him power\r\naccordingly; but if they had only contrived to fly away, he would have\r\nhim give them an admonition, and not proceed to extremity with them. He\r\nalso advised him to get an assembly together, and to appoint some place\r\nnear Berytus, 14 which is a city belonging to the Romans, and to take\r\nthe presidents of Syria, and Archelaus king of Cappadocia, and as many\r\nmore as he thought to be illustrious for their friendship to him, and\r\nthe dignities they were in, and determine what should be done by their\r\napprobation. These were the directions that Cæsar gave him. Accordingly\r\nHerod, when the letter was brought to him, was immediately very glad of\r\nCæsar's reconciliation to him, and very glad also that he had a complete\r\nauthority given him over his sons. And it strangely came about, that\r\nwhereas before, in his adversity, though he had indeed showed himself\r\nsevere, yet had he not been very rash nor hasty in procuring the\r\ndestruction of his sons; he now, in his prosperity, took advantage of\r\nthis change for the better, and the freedom he now had, to exercise his\r\nhatred against them after an unheard of manner; he therefore sent and\r\ncalled as many as he thought fit to this assembly, excepting Archelaus;\r\nfor as for him, he either hated him, so that he would not invite him, or\r\nhe thought he would be an obstacle to his designs.\r\n\r\n2. When the presidents, and the rest that belonged to the cities, were\r\ncome to Berytus, he kept his sons in a certain village belonging to\r\nSidon, called Platana, but near to this city, that if they were called,\r\nhe might produce them, for he did not think fit to bring them before the\r\nassembly: and when there were one hundred and fifty assessors present,\r\nHerod came by himself alone, and accused his sons, and that in such a\r\nway as if it were not a melancholy accusation, and not made but out of\r\nnecessity, and upon the misfortunes he was under; indeed, in such a way\r\nas was very indecent for a father to accuse his sons, for he was very\r\nvehement and disordered when he came to the demonstration of the crime\r\nthey were accused of, and gave the greatest signs of passion and\r\nbarbarity: nor would he suffer the assessors to consider of the weight\r\nof the evidence, but asserted them to be true by his own authority,\r\nafter a manner most indecent in a father against his sons, and read\r\nhimself what they themselves had written, wherein there was no\r\nconfession of any plots or contrivances against him, but only how they\r\nhad contrived to fly away, and containing withal certain reproaches\r\nagainst him, on account of the ill-will he bare them; and when he came\r\nto those reproaches, he cried out most of all, and exaggerated what they\r\nsaid, as if they had confessed the design against him, and took his oath\r\nthat he had rather lose his life than hear such reproachful words. At\r\nlast he said that he had sufficient authority, both by nature and by\r\nCæsar's grant to him, [to do what he thought fit]. He also added an\r\nallegation of a law of their country, which enjoined this: That if\r\nparents laid their hands on the head of him that was accused, the\r\nstanders by were obliged to cast stones at him, and thereby to slay him;\r\nwhich though he were ready to do in his own country and kingdom, yet did\r\nhe wait for their determination; and yet they came thither not so much\r\nas judges, to condemn them for such manifest designs against him,\r\nwhereby he had almost perished by his sons' means, but as persons that\r\nhad an opportunity of showing their detestation of such practices, and\r\ndeclaring how unworthy a thing it must be in any, even the most remote,\r\nto pass over such treacherous designs [without punishment].\r\n\r\n3. When the king had said this, and the young men had not been produced\r\nto make any defense for themselves, the assessors perceived there was no\r\nroom for equity and reconciliation, so they confirmed his authority. And\r\nin the first place, Saturninus, a person that had been consul, and one\r\nof great dignity, pronounced his sentence, but with great moderation and\r\ntrouble; and said that he condemned Herod's sons, but did not think they\r\nshould be put to death. He had sons of his own, and to put one's son to\r\ndeath is a greater misfortune than any other that could befall him by\r\ntheir means. After him Saturninus's sons, for he had three sons that\r\nfollowed him, and were his legates, pronounced the same sentence with\r\ntheir father. On the contrary, Volumnius's sentence was to inflict death\r\non such as had been so impiously undutiful to their father; and the\r\ngreatest part of the rest said the same, insomuch that the conclusion\r\nseemed to be, that the young men were condemned to die. Immediately\r\nafter this Herod came away from thence, and took his sons to Tyre, where\r\nNicolaus met him in his voyage from Rome; of whom he inquired, after he\r\nhad related to him what had passed at Berytus, what his sentiments were\r\nabout his sons, and what his friends at Rome thought of that matter. His\r\nanswer was, \"That what they had determined to do to thee was impious,\r\nand that thou oughtest to keep them in prison; and if thou thinkest any\r\nthing further necessary, thou mayst indeed so punish them, that thou\r\nmayst not appear to indulge thy anger more than to govern thyself by\r\njudgment; but if thou inclinest to the milder side, thou mayst absolve\r\nthem, lest perhaps thy misfortunes be rendered incurable; and this is\r\nthe opinion of the greatest part of thy friends at Rome also.\" Whereupon\r\nHerod was silent, and in great thoughtfulness, and bid Nicolaus sail\r\nalong with him.\r\n\r\n4. Now as they came to Cæsarea, every body was there talking of Herod's\r\nsons, and the kingdom was in suspense, and the people in great\r\nexpectation of what would become of them; for a terrible fear seized\r\nupon all men, lest the ancient disorders of the family should come to a\r\nsad conclusion, and they were in great trouble about their sufferings;\r\nnor was it without danger to say any rash thing about this matter, nor\r\neven to hear another saying it, but men's pity was forced to be shut up\r\nin themselves, which rendered the excess of their sorrow very irksome,\r\nbut very silent yet was there an old soldier of Herod's, whose name was\r\nTero, who had a son of the same age with Alexander, and his friend, who\r\nwas so very free as openly to speak out what others silently thought\r\nabout that matter; and was forced to cry out often among the multitude,\r\nand said, in the most unguarded manner, that truth was perished, and\r\njustice taken away from men, while lies and ill-will prevailed, and\r\nbrought such a mist before public affairs, that the offenders were not\r\nable to see the greatest mischiefs that can befall men. And as he was so\r\nbold, he seemed not to have kept himself out of danger, by speaking so\r\nfreely; but the reasonableness of what he said moved men to regard him\r\nas having behaved himself with great manhood, and this at a proper time\r\nalso, for which reason every one heard what he said with pleasure; and\r\nalthough they first took care of their own safety by keeping silent\r\nthemselves, yet did they kindly receive the great freedom he took; for\r\nthe expectation they were in of so great an affliction, put a force upon\r\nthem to speak of Tero whatsoever they pleased.\r\n\r\n5. This man had thrust himself into the king's presence with the\r\ngreatest freedom, and desired to speak with him by himself alone, which\r\nthe king permitted him to do, where he said this: \"Since I am not able,\r\nO king, to bear up under so great a concern as I am under, I have\r\npreferred the use of this bold liberty that I now take, which may be for\r\nthy advantage, if thou mind to get any profit by it, before my own\r\nsafety. Whither is thy understanding gone, and left thy soul empty?\r\nWhither is that extraordinary sagacity of thine gone whereby thou hast\r\nperformed so many and such glorious-actions? Whence comes this solitude,\r\nand desertion of thy friends and relations? Of which I cannot but\r\ndetermine that they are neither thy friends nor relations, while they\r\noverlook such horrid wickedness in thy once happy kingdom. Dost not thou\r\nperceive what is doing? Wilt thou slay these two young men, born of thy\r\nqueen, who are accomplished with every virtue in the highest degree, and\r\nleave thyself destitute in thy old age, but exposed to one son, who hath\r\nvery ill managed the hopes thou hast given him,' and to relations, whose\r\ndeath thou hast so often resolved on thyself? Dost not thou take notice,\r\nthat the very silence of the multitude at once sees the crime, and\r\nabhors the fact? The whole army and the officers have commiseration on\r\nthe poor unhappy youths, and hatred to those that are the actors in this\r\nmatter.\" These words the king heard, and for some time with good temper.\r\nBut what can one say? When Tero plainly touched upon the bad behavior\r\nand perfidiousness of his domestics, he was moved at it; but Tero went\r\non further, and by degrees used an unbounded military freedom of speech,\r\nnor was he so well disciplined as to accommodate himself to the time. So\r\nHerod was greatly disturbed, and seeming to be rather reproached by this\r\nspeech, than to be hearing what was for his advantage, while he learned\r\nthereby that both the soldiers abhorred the thing he was about, and the\r\nofficers had indignation at it, he gave order that all whom Tero had\r\nnamed, and Tero himself, should be bound and kept in prison.\r\n\r\n6. When this was over, one Trypho, who was the king's barber, took the\r\nopportunity, and came and told the king, that Tero would often have\r\npersuaded him, when he trimmed him with a razor, to cut his throat, for\r\nthat by this means he should be among the chief of Alexander's friends,\r\nand receive great rewards from him. When he had said this, the king gave\r\norder that Tero, and his son, and the barber should be tortured, which\r\nwas done accordingly; but while Tero bore up himself, his son seeing his\r\nfather already in a sad case, and had no hope of deliverance, and\r\nperceiving what would be the consequence of his terrible sufferings,\r\nsaid, that if the king would free him and his father from these torments\r\nfor what he should say, he would tell the truth. And when the king had\r\ngiven his word to do so, he said that there was an agreement made, that\r\nTero should lay violent hands on the king, because it was easy for him\r\nto come when he was alone; and that if, when he had done the thing, he\r\nshould suffer death for it, as was not unlikely, it would be an act of\r\ngenerosity done in favor of Alexander. This was what Tero's son said,\r\nand thereby freed his father from the distress he was in; but uncertain\r\nit is whether he had been thus forced to speak what was true, or whether\r\nit were a contrivance of his, in order to procure his own and his\r\nfather's deliverance from their miseries.\r\n\r\n7. As for Herod, if he had before any doubt about the slaughter of his\r\nsons, there was now no longer any room left in his soul for it; but he\r\nhad banished away whatsoever might afford him the least suggestion of\r\nreasoning better about this matter, so he already made haste to bring\r\nhis purpose to a conclusion. He also brought out three hundred of the\r\nofficers that were under an accusation, as also Tero and his son, and\r\nthe barber that accused them before an assembly, and brought an\r\naccusation against them all; whom the multitude stoned with whatsoever\r\ncame to hand, and thereby slew them. Alexander also and Aristobulus were\r\nbrought to Sebaste, by their father's command, and there strangled; but\r\ntheir dead bodies were in the night time carried to Alexandrium, where\r\ntheir uncle by the mother's side, and the greatest part of their\r\nancestors, had been deposited.\r\n\r\n8. 15 And now perhaps it may not seem unreasonable to some, that such an\r\ninveterate hatred might increase so much [on both sides], as to proceed\r\nfurther, and overcome nature; but it may justly deserve consideration,\r\nwhether it be to be laid to the charge of the young men, that they gave\r\nsuch an occasion to their father's anger, and led him to do what he did,\r\nand by going on long in the same way put things past remedy, and brought\r\nhim to use them so unmercifully; or whether it be to be laid to the\r\nfather's charge, that he was so hard-hearted, and so very tender in the\r\ndesire of government, and of other things that would tend to his glory,\r\nthat tae would take no one into a partnership with him, that so\r\nwhatsoever he would have done himself might continue immovable; or,\r\nindeed, whether fortune have not greater power than all prudent\r\nreasonings; whence we are persuaded that human actions are thereby\r\ndetermined beforehand by an inevitable necessity, and we call her Fate,\r\nbecause there is nothing which is not done by her; wherefore I suppose\r\nit will be sufficient to compare this notion with that other, which\r\nattribute somewhat to ourselves, and renders men not unaccountable for\r\nthe different conducts of their lives, which notion is no other than the\r\nphilosophical determination of our ancient law. Accordingly, of the two\r\nother causes of this sad event, any body may lay the blame on the young\r\nmen, who acted by youthful vanity, and pride of their royal birth, that\r\nthey should bear to hear the calumnies that were raised against their\r\nfather, while certainly they were not equitable judges of the actions of\r\nhis life, but ill-natured in suspecting, and intemperate in speaking of\r\nit, and on both accounts easily caught by those that observed them, and\r\nrevealed them to gain favor; yet cannot their father be thought worthy\r\nexcuse, as to that horrid impiety which he was guilty of about them,\r\nwhile he ventured, without any certain evidence of their treacherous\r\ndesigns against him, and without any proofs that they had made\r\npreparations for such attempt, to kill his own sons, who were of very\r\ncomely bodies, and the great darlings of other men, and no way deficient\r\nin their conduct, whether it were in hunting, or in warlike exercises,\r\nor in speaking upon occasional topics of discourse; for in all these\r\nthey were skillful, and especially Alexander, who was the eldest; for\r\ncertainly it had been sufficient, even though he had condemned them, to\r\nhave kept them alive in bonds, or to let them live at a distance from\r\nhis dominions in banishment, while he was surrounded by the Roman\r\nforces, which were a strong security to him, whose help would prevent\r\nhis suffering any thing by a sudden onset, or by open force; but for him\r\nto kill them on the sudden, in order to gratify a passion that governed\r\nhim, was a demonstration of insufferable impiety. He also was guilty of\r\nso great a crime in his older age; nor will the delays that he made, and\r\nthe length of time in which the thing was done, plead at all for his\r\nexcuse; for when a man is on a sudden amazed, and in commotion of mind,\r\nand then commits a wicked action, although this be a heavy crime, yet is\r\nit a thing that frequently happens; but to do it upon deliberation, and\r\nafter frequent attempts, and as frequent puttings-off, to undertake it\r\nat last, and accomplish it, was the action of a murderous mind, and such\r\nas was not easily moved from that which is evil. And this temper he\r\nshowed in what he did afterward, when he did not spare those that seemed\r\nto be the best beloved of his friends that were left, wherein, though\r\nthe justice of the punishment caused those that perished to be the less\r\npitied, yet was the barbarity of the man here equal, in that he did not\r\nabstain from their slaughter also. But of those persons we shall have\r\noccasion to discourse more hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ We may here observe the ancient practice of the Jews, of\r\ndedicating the sabbath day, not to idleness, but to the learning their\r\nsacred rites and religious customs, and to the meditation on the law of\r\nMoses; the like to which we meet with elsewhere in Josephus also against\r\nApion, B.

Containing The Interval Of Fourteen Years.—From The Death Of\r\nAlexander And Aristobulus To The Banishment Of Archelaus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. How Antipater Was Hated By All The Nation [Of The Jews] For\r\nThe Slaughter Of His Brethren; And How, For That Reason He Got Into\r\nPeculiar Favor With His Friends At Rome, By Giving Them Many Presents;\r\nAs He Did Also With Saturninus, The President Of Syria And The Governors\r\nWho Were Under Him; And Concerning Herod's Wives And Children.\r\n\r\n1. When Antipater had thus taken off his brethren, and had brought his\r\nfather into the highest degree of impiety, till he was haunted with\r\nfuries for what he had done, his hopes did not succeed to his mind, as\r\nto the rest of his life; for although he was delivered from the fear of\r\nhis brethren being his rivals as to the government, yet did he find it a\r\nvery hard thing, and almost impracticable, to come at the kingdom,\r\nbecause the hatred of the nation against him on that account was become\r\nvery great; and besides this very disagreeable circumstance, the affair\r\nof the soldiery grieved him still more, who were alienated from him,\r\nfrom which yet these kings derived all the safety which they had,\r\nwhenever they found the nation desirous of innovation: and all this\r\ndanger was drawn upon him by his destruction of his brethren. However,\r\nhe governed the nation jointly with his father, being indeed no other\r\nthan a king already; and he was for that very reason trusted, and the\r\nmore firmly depended on, for the which he ought himself to have been put\r\nto death, as appearing to have betrayed his brethren out of his concern\r\nfor the preservation of Herod, and not rather out of his ill-will to\r\nthem, and, before them, to his father himself: and this was the accursed\r\nstate he was in. Now all Antipater's contrivances tended to make his way\r\nto take off Herod, that he might have nobody to accuse him in the vile\r\npractices he was devising: and that Herod might have no refuge, nor any\r\nto afford him their assistance, since they must thereby have Antipater\r\nfor their open enemy; insomuch that the very plots he had laid against\r\nhis brethren were occasioned by the hatred he bore his father. But at\r\nthis time he was more than ever set upon the execution of his attempts\r\nagainst Herod, because if he were once dead, the government would now be\r\nfirmly secured to him; but if he were suffered to live any longer, he\r\nshould be in danger, upon a discovery of that wickedness of which he had\r\nbeen the contriver, and his father would of necessity then become his\r\nenemy. And on this account it was that he became very bountiful to his\r\nfather's friends, and bestowed great sums on several of them, in order\r\nto surprise men with his good deeds, and take off their hatred against\r\nhim. And he sent great presents to his friends at Rome particularly, to\r\ngain their good-will; and above all to Saturninus, the president of\r\nSyria. He also hoped to gain the favor of Saturninus's brother with the\r\nlarge presents he bestowed on him; as also he used the same art to\r\n[Salome] the king's sister, who had married one of Herod's chief\r\nfriends. And when he counterfeited friendship to those with whom he\r\nconversed, he was very subtle in gaining their belief, and very cunning\r\nto hide his hatred against any that he really did hate. But he could not\r\nimpose upon his aunt, who understood him of a long time, and was a woman\r\nnot easily to be deluded, especially while she had already used all\r\npossible caution in preventing his pernicious designs. Although\r\nAntipeter's uncle by the mother's side was married to her daughter, and\r\nthis by his own connivance and management, while she had before been\r\nmarried to Aristobulus, and while Salome's other daughter by that\r\nhusband was married to the son of Calleas; yet that marriage was no\r\nobstacle to her, who knew how wicked he was, in her discovering his\r\ndesigns, as her former kindred to him could not prevent her hatred of\r\nhim. Now Herod had compelled Salome, while she was in love with Sylleus\r\nthe Arabian, and had taken a fondness for him, to marry Alexas; which\r\nmatch was by her submitted to at the instance of Julia, who persuaded\r\nSalome not to refuse it, lest she should herself be their open enemy,\r\nsince Herod had sworn that he would never be friends with Salome, if she\r\nwould not accept of Alexas for her husband; so she submitted to Julia as\r\nbeing Cæsar's wife; and besides that, she advised her to nothing but\r\nwhat was very much for her own advantage. At this time also it was that\r\nHerod sent back king Archelaus's daughter, who had been Alexander's\r\nwife, to her father, returning the portion he had with her out of his\r\nown estate, that there might be no dispute between them about it.\r\n\r\n2. Now Herod brought up his sons' children with great care; for\r\nAlexander had two sons by Glaphyra; and Aristobulus had three sons by\r\nBernice, Salome's daughter, and two daughters; and as his friends were\r\nonce with him, he presented the children before them; and deploring the\r\nhard fortune of his own sons, he prayed that no such ill fortune would\r\nbefall these who were their children, but that they might improve in\r\nvirtue, and obtain what they justly deserved, and might make him amends\r\nfor his care of their education. He also caused them to be betrothed\r\nagainst they should come to the proper age of marriage; the elder of\r\nAlexander's sons to Pheroras's daughter, and Antipater's daughter to\r\nAristobulus's eldest son. He also allotted one of Aristobulus's\r\ndaughters to Antipater's son, and Aristobulus's other daughter to Herod,\r\na son of his own, who was born to him by the high priest's daughter; for\r\nit is the ancient practice among us to have many wives at the same time.\r\nNow the king made these espousals for the children, out of commiseration\r\nof them now they were fatherless, as endeavoring to render Antipater\r\nkind to them by these intermarriages. But Antipater did not fail to bear\r\nthe same temper of mind to his brothers' children which he had borne to\r\nhis brothers themselves; and his father's concern about them provoked\r\nhis indignation against them upon this supposal, that they would become\r\ngreater than ever his brothers had been; while Archelaus, a king, would\r\nsupport his daughter's sons, and Pheroras, a tetrarch, would accept of\r\none of the daughters as a wife to his son. What provoked him also was\r\nthis, that all the multitude would so commiserate these fatherless\r\nchildren, and so hate him [for making them fatherless], that all would\r\ncome out, since they were no strangers to his vile disposition towards\r\nhis brethren. He contrived, therefore, to overturn his father's\r\nsettlements, as thinking it a terrible thing that they should be so\r\nrelated to him, and be so powerful withal. So Herod yielded to him, and\r\nchanged his resolution at his entreaty; and the determination now was,\r\nthat Antipater himself should marry Aristobulus's daughter, and\r\nAntipater's son should marry Pheroras's daughter. So the espousals for\r\nthe marriages were changed after this manner, even without the king's\r\nreal approbation.\r\n\r\n3. Now Herod the king had at this time nine wives; one of them\r\nAntipater's mother, and another the high priest's daughter, by whom he\r\nhad a son of his own name. He had also one who was his brother's\r\ndaughter, and another his sister's daughter; which two had no children.\r\nOne of his wives also was of the Samaritan nation, whose sons were\r\nAntipas and Archelaus, and whose daughter was Olympias; which daughter\r\nwas afterward married to Joseph, the king's brother's son; but Archelaus\r\nand Antipas were brought up with a certain private man at Rome. Herod\r\nhad also to wife Cleopatra of Jerusalem, and by her he had his sons\r\nHerod and Philip; which last was also brought up at Rome. Pallas also\r\nwas one of his wives, which bare him his son Phasaelus. And besides\r\nthese, he had for his wives Phedra and Elpis, by whom he had his\r\ndaughters Roxana and Salome. As for his elder daughters by the same\r\nmother with Alexander and Aristobulus, and whom Pheroras neglected to\r\nmarry, he gave the one in marriage to Antipater, the king's sister's\r\nson, and the other to Phasaelus, his brother's son. And this was the\r\nposterity of Herod. 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. Concerning Zamaris, The Babylonian Jew; Concerning The Plots\r\nLaid By Antipater Against His Father; And Somewhat About The Pharisees.\r\n\r\n1. And now it was that Herod, being desirous of securing himself on the\r\nside of the Trachonites, resolved to build a village as large as a city\r\nfor the Jews, in the middle of that country, which might make his own\r\ncountry difficult to be assaulted, and whence he might be at hand to\r\nmake sallies upon them, and do them a mischief. Accordingly, when he\r\nunderstood that there was a man that was a Jew come out of Babylon, with\r\nfive hundred horsemen, all of whom could shoot their arrows as they rode\r\non horse-back, and, with a hundred of his relations, had passed over\r\nEuphrates, and now abode at Antioch by Daphne of Syria, where\r\nSaturninus, who was then president, had given them a place for\r\nhabitation, called Valatha, he sent for this man, with the multitude\r\nthat followed him, and promised to give him land in the toparchy called\r\nBatanea, which country is bounded with Trachonitis, as desirous to make\r\nthat his habitation a guard to himself. He also engaged to let him hold\r\nthe country free from tribute, and that they should dwell entirely\r\nwithout paying such customs as used to be paid, and gave it him tax-\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n2. The Babylonian was reduced by these offers to come hither; so he took\r\npossession of the land, and built in it fortresses and a village, and\r\nnamed it Bathyra. Whereby this man became a safeguard to the inhabitants\r\nagainst the Trachonites, and preserved those Jews who came out of\r\nBabylon, to offer their sacrifices at Jerusalem, from being hurt by the\r\nTrachonite robbers; so that a great number came to him from all those\r\nparts where the ancient Jewish laws were observed, and the country\r\nbecame full of people, by reason of their universal freedom from taxes.\r\nThis continued during the life of Herod; but when Philip, who was\r\n[tetrarch] after him, took the government, he made them pay some small\r\ntaxes, and that for a little while only; and Agrippa the Great, and his\r\nson of the same name, although they harassed them greatly, yet would\r\nthey not take their liberty away. From whom, when the Romans have now\r\ntaken the government into their own hands, they still gave them the\r\nprivilege of their freedom, but oppress them entirely with the\r\nimposition of taxes. Of which matter I shall treat more accurately in\r\nthe progress of this history. 2\r\n\r\n3. At length Zamaris the Babylonian, to whom Herod had given that\r\ncountry for a possession, died, having lived virtuously, and left\r\nchildren of a good character behind him; one of whom was Jacim, who was\r\nfamous for his valor, and taught his Babylonians how to ride their\r\nhorses; and a troop of them were guards to the forementioned kings. And\r\nwhen Jacim was dead in his old age, he left a son, whose name was\r\nPhilip, one of great strength in his hands, and in other respects also\r\nmore eminent for his valor than any of his contemporaries; on which\r\naccount there was a confidence and firm friendship between him and king\r\nAgrippa. He had also an army which he maintained as great as that of a\r\nking, which he exercised and led wheresoever he had occasion to march.\r\n\r\n4. When the affairs of Herod were in the condition I have described, all\r\nthe public affairs depended upon Antipater; and his power was such, that\r\nhe could do good turns to as many as he pleased, and this by his\r\nfather's concession, in hopes of his good-will and fidelity to him; and\r\nthis till he ventured to use his power still further, because his wicked\r\ndesigns were concealed from his father, and he made him believe every\r\nthing he said. He was also formidable to all, not so much on account of\r\nthe power and authority he had, as for the shrewdness of his vile\r\nattempts beforehand; but he who principally cultivated a friendship with\r\nhim was Pheroras, who received the like marks of his friendship; while\r\nAntipater had cunningly encompassed him about by a company of women,\r\nwhom he placed as guards about him; for Pheroras was greatly enslaved to\r\nhis wife, and to her mother, and to her sister; and this notwithstanding\r\nthe hatred he bare them for the indignities they had offered to his\r\nvirgin daughters. Yet did he bear them, and nothing was to be done\r\nwithout the women, who had got this man into their circle, and continued\r\nstill to assist each other in all things, insomuch that Antipater was\r\nentirely addicted to them, both by himself and by his mother; for these\r\nfour women, 3 said all one and the same thing; but the opinions of\r\nPheroras and Antipater were different in some points of no consequence.\r\nBut the king's sister [Salome] was their antagonist, who for a good\r\nwhile had looked about all their affairs, and was apprized that this\r\ntheir friendship was made in order to do Herod some mischief, and was\r\ndisposed to inform the king of it. And since these people knew that\r\ntheir friendship was very disagreeable to Herod, as tending to do him a\r\nmischief, they contrived that their meetings should not be discovered;\r\nso they pretended to hate one another, and to abuse one another when\r\ntime served, and especially when Herod was present, or when any one was\r\nthere that would tell him: but still their intimacy was firmer than\r\never, when they were private. And this was the course they took. But\r\nthey could not conceal from Salome neither their first contrivance, when\r\nthey set about these their intentions, nor when they had made some\r\nprogress in them; but she searched out every thing; and, aggravating the\r\nrelations to her brother, declared to him, as well their secret\r\nassemblies and compotations, as their counsels taken in a clandestine\r\nmanner, which if they were not in order to destroy him, they might well\r\nenough have been open and public. But to appearance they are at\r\nvariance, and speak about one another as if they intended one another a\r\nmischief, but agree so well together when they are out of the sight of\r\nthe multitude; for when they are alone by themselves, they act in\r\nconcert, and profess that they will never leave off their friendship,\r\nbut will fight against those from whom they conceal their designs. And\r\nthus did she search out these things, and get a perfect knowledge of\r\nthem, and then told her brother of them, who understood also of himself\r\na great deal of what she said, but still durst not depend upon it,\r\nbecause of the suspicions he had of his sister's calumnies. For there\r\nwas a certain sect of men that were Jews, who valued themselves highly\r\nupon the exact skill they had in the law of their fathers, and made men\r\nbelieve they were highly favored by God, by whom this set of women were\r\ninveigled. These are those that are called the sect of the Pharisees,\r\nwho were in a capacity of greatly opposing kings. A cunning sect they\r\nwere, and soon elevated to a pitch of open fighting and doing mischief.\r\nAccordingly, when all the people of the Jews gave assurance of their\r\ngood-will to Cæsar, and to the king's government, these very men did not\r\nswear, being above six thousand; and when the king imposed a fine upon\r\nthem, Pheroras's wife paid their fine for them. In order to requite\r\nwhich kindness of hers, since they were believed to have the\r\nforeknowledge of things to come by Divine inspiration, they foretold how\r\nGod had decreed that Herod's government should cease, and his posterity\r\nshould be deprived of it; but that the kingdom should come to her and\r\nPheroras, and to their children. These predictions were not concealed\r\nfrom Salome, but were told the king; as also how they had perverted some\r\npersons about the palace itself; so the king slew such of the Pharisees\r\nas were principally accused, and Bagoas the eunuch, and one Carus, who\r\nexceeded all men of that time in comeliness, and one that was his\r\ncatamite. He slew also all those of his own family who had consented to\r\nwhat the Pharisees foretold; and for Bagoas, he had been puffed up by\r\nthem, as though he should be named the father and the benefactor of him\r\nwho, by the prediction, was foretold to be their appointed king; for\r\nthat this king would have all things in his power, and would enable\r\nBagoas to marry, and to have children of his own body begotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. Concerning The Enmity Between Herod And Pheroras; How Herod\r\nSent Antipater To Cæsar; And Of The Death Of Pheroras.\r\n\r\n1. When Herod had punished those Pharisees who had been convicted of the\r\nforegoing crimes, he gathered an assembly together of his friends, and\r\naccused Pheroras's wife; and ascribing the abuses of the virgins to the\r\nimpudence of that woman, brought an accusation against her for the\r\ndishonor she had brought upon them: that she had studiously introduced a\r\nquarrel between him and his brother, and, by her ill temper, had brought\r\nthem into a state of war, both by her words and actions; that the fines\r\nwhich he had laid had not been paid, and the offenders had escaped\r\npunishment by her means; and that nothing which had of late been done\r\nhad been done without her; \"for which reason Pheroras would do well, if\r\nhe would of his own accord, and by his own command, and not at my\r\nentreaty, or as following my opinion, put this his wife away, as one\r\nthat will still be the occasion of war between thee and me. And now,\r\nPheroras, if thou valuest thy relation to me, put this wife of thine\r\naway; for by this means thou wilt continue to be a brother to me, and\r\nwilt abide in thy love to me.\" Then said Pheroras, [although he was\r\npressed hard by the former words,] that as he would not do so unjust a\r\nthing as to renounce his brotherly relation to him, so would he not\r\nleave off his affection for his wife; that he would rather choose to die\r\nthan to live, and be deprived of a wife that was so dear unto him.\r\nHereupon Herod put off his anger against Pheroras on these accounts,\r\nalthough he himself thereby underwent a very uneasy punishment. However,\r\nhe forbade Antipater and his mother to have any conversation with\r\nPheroras, and bid them to take care to avoid the assemblies of the\r\nwomen; which they promised to do, but still got together when occasion\r\nserved, and both Ptieroras and Antipater had their own merry meetings.\r\nThe report went also, that Antipater had criminal conversation with\r\nPheroras's wife, and that they were brought together by Antipater's\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n2. But Antipater had now a suspicion of his father, and was afraid that\r\nthe effects of his hatred to him might increase; so he wrote to his\r\nfriends at Rome, and bid them to send to Herod, that he would\r\nimmediately send Antipater to Cæsar; which when it was done, Herod sent\r\nAntipater thither, and sent most noble presents along with him; as also\r\nhis testament, wherein Antipater was appointed to be his successor; and\r\nthat if Antipater should die first, his son [Herod Philip] by the high\r\npriest's daughter should succeed. And, together with Antipater, there\r\nwent to Rome Sylleus the Arabian, although he had done nothing of all\r\nthat Cæsar had enjoined him. Antipater also accused him of the same\r\ncrimes of which he had been formerly accused by Herod. Sylleus was also\r\naccused by Aretas, that without his consent he had slain many of the\r\nchief of the Arabians at Petra; and particularly Soemus, a man that\r\ndeserved to be honored by all men; and that he had slain Fabatus, a\r\nservant of Cæsar. These were the things of which Sylleus was accused,\r\nand that on the occasion following: There was one Corinthus, belonging\r\nto Herod, of the guards of the king's body, and one who was greatly\r\ntrusted by him. Sylleus had persuaded this man with the offer of a great\r\nsum of money to kill Herod; and he had promised to do it. When Fabatus\r\nhad been made acquainted with this, for Sylleus had himself told him of\r\nit, he informed the king of it; who caught Corinthus, and put him to the\r\ntorture, and thereby got out of him the whole conspiracy. He also caught\r\ntwo other Arabians, who were discovered by Corinthus; the one the head\r\nof a tribe, and the other a friend to Sylleus, who both were by the king\r\nbrought to the torture, and confessed that they were come to encourage\r\nCorinthus not to fail of doing what he had undertaken to do; and to\r\nassist him with their own hands in the murder, if need should require\r\ntheir assistance. So Saturninus, upon Herod's discovering the whole to\r\nhim, sent them to Rome.\r\n\r\n3. At this time Herod commanded Pheroras, that since he was so obstinate\r\nin his affection for his wife, he should retire into his own tetrarchy;\r\nwhich he did very willingly, and sware many oaths that he would not come\r\nagain till he heard that Herod was dead. And indeed when, upon a\r\nsickness of the king, he was desired to come to him before he died, that\r\nhe might intrust him with some of his injunctions, he had such a regard\r\nto his oath, that he would not come to him; yet did not Herod so retain\r\nhis hatred to Pheroras, but remitted of his purpose [not to see him],\r\nwhich he before had, and that for such great causes as have been already\r\nmentioned: but as soon as he began to be ill, he came to him, and this\r\nwithout being sent for; and when he was dead, he took care of his\r\nfuneral, and had his body brought to Jerusalem, and buried there, and\r\nappointed a solemn mourning for him. This [death of Pheroras] became the\r\norigin of Antipater's misfortunes, although he were already sailed for\r\nRome, God now being about to punish him for the murder of his brethren,\r\nI will explain the history of this matter very distinctly, that it may\r\nbe for a warning to mankind, that they take care of conducting their\r\nwhole lives by the rules of virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. Pheroras's Wife Is Accused By His Freedmen, As Guilty Of\r\nPoisoning Him; And How Herod, Upon Examining; Of The Matter By Torture\r\nFound The Poison; But So That It Had Been Prepared For Himself By His\r\nSon Antipater; And Upon An Inquiry By Torture He Discovered The\r\nDangerous Designs Of Antipater.\r\n\r\n1. As soon as Pheroras was dead, and his funeral was over, two of\r\nPheroras's freed-men, who were much esteemed by him, came to Herod, and\r\nentreated him not to leave the murder of his brother without avenging\r\nit, but to examine into such an unreasonable and unhappy death. When he\r\nwas moved with these words, for they seemed to him to be true, they said\r\nthat Pheroras supped with his wife the day before he fell sick, and that\r\na certain potion was brought him in such a sort of food as he was not\r\nused to eat; but that when he had eaten, he died of it: that this potion\r\nwas brought out of Arabia by a woman, under pretense indeed as a love-\r\npotion, for that was its name, but in reality to kill Pheroras; for that\r\nthe Arabian women are skillful in making such poisons: and the woman to\r\nwhom they ascribe this was confessedly a most intimate friend of one of\r\nSylleus's mistresses; and that both the mother and the sister of\r\nPheroras's wife had been at the places where she lived, and had\r\npersuaded her to sell them this potion, and had come back and brought it\r\nwith them the day before that his supper. Hereupon the king was\r\nprovoked, and put the women slaves to the torture, and some that were\r\nfree with them; and as the fact did not yet appear, because none of them\r\nwould confess it, at length one of them, under the utmost agonies, said\r\nno more but this, that she prayed that God would send the like agonies\r\nupon Antipater's mother, who had been the occasion of these miseries to\r\nall of them. This prayer induced Herod to increase the women's tortures,\r\ntill thereby all was discovered; their merry meetings, their secret\r\nassemblies, and the disclosing of what he had said to his son alone unto\r\nPheroras's 4 women. [Now what Herod had charged Antipater to conceal,\r\nwas the gift of a hundred talents to him not to have any conversation\r\nwith Pheroras.] And what hatred he bore to his father; and that he\r\ncomplained to his mother how very long his father lived; and that he was\r\nhimself almost an old man, insomuch that if the kingdom should come to\r\nhim, it would not afford him any great pleasure; and that there were a\r\ngreat many of his brothers, or brothers' children, bringing up, that\r\nmight have hopes of the kingdom as well as himself, all which made his\r\nown hopes of it uncertain; for that even now, if he should himself not\r\nlive, Herod had ordained that the government should be conferred, not on\r\nhis son, but rather on a brother. He also had accused the king of great\r\nbarbarity, and of the slaughter of his sons; and that it was out of the\r\nfear he was under, lest he should do the like to him, that made him\r\ncontrive this his journey to Rome, and Pheroras contrive to go to his\r\nown tetrarchy. 5\r\n\r\n2. These confessions agreed with what his sister had told him, and\r\ntended greatly to corroborate her testimony, and to free her from the\r\nsuspicion of her unfaithfulness to him. So the king having satisfied\r\nhimself of the spite which Doris, Antipater's mother, as well as\r\nhimself, bore to him, took away from her all her fine ornaments, which\r\nwere worth many talents, and then sent her away, and entered into\r\nfriendship with Pheroras's women. But he who most of all irritated the\r\nking against his son was one Antipater, the procurator of Antipater the\r\nking's son, who, when he was tortured, among other things, said that\r\nAntipater had prepared a deadly potion, and given it to Pheroras, with\r\nhis desire that he would give it to his father during his absence, and\r\nwhen he was too remote to have the least suspicion cast upon him thereto\r\nrelating; that Antiphilus, one of Antipater's friends, brought that\r\npotion out of Egypt; and that it was sent to Pheroras by Thendion, the\r\nbrother of the mother of Antipater, the king's son, and by that means\r\ncame to Pheroras's wife, her husband having given it her to keep. And\r\nwhen the king asked her about it, she confessed it; and as she was\r\nrunning to fetch it, she threw herself down from the house-top; yet did\r\nshe not kill herself, because she fell upon her feet; by which means,\r\nwhen the king had comforted her, and had promised her and her domestics\r\npardon, upon condition of their concealing nothing of the truth from\r\nhim, but had threatened her with the utmost miseries if she proved\r\nungrateful [and concealed any thing]: so she promised, and swore that\r\nshe would speak out every thing, and tell after what manner every thing\r\nwas done; and said what many took to be entirely true, that the potion\r\nwas brought out of Egypt by Antiphilus; and that his brother, who was a\r\nphysician, had procured it; and that \"when Thendion brought it us, she\r\nkept it upon Pheroras's committing it to her; and that it was prepared\r\nby Antipater for thee. When, therefore, Pheroras was fallen sick, and\r\nthou camest to him and tookest care of him, and when he saw the kindness\r\nthou hadst for him, his mind was overborne thereby. So he called me to\r\nhim, and said to me, 'O woman! Antipater hath circumvented me in this\r\naffair of his father and my brother, by persuading me to have a\r\nmurderous intention to him, and procuring a potion to be subservient\r\nthereto; do thou, therefore, go and fetch my potion, [since my brother\r\nappears to have still the same virtuous disposition towards me which he\r\nhad formerly, and I do not expect to live long myself, and that I may\r\nnot defile my forefathers by the murder of a brother,] and burn it\r\nbefore my face:' that accordingly she immediately brought it, and did as\r\nher husband bade her; and that she burnt the greatest part of the\r\npotion; but that a little of it was left, that if the king, after\r\nPheroras's death, should treat her ill, she might poison herself, and\r\nthereby get clear of her miseries.\" Upon her saying thus, she brought\r\nout the potion, and the box in which it was, before them all. Nay, there\r\nwas another brother of Antiphilus, and his mother also, who, by the\r\nextremity of pain and torture, confessed the same things, and owned the\r\nbox [to be that which had been brought out of Egypt]. The high priest's\r\ndaughter also, who was the king's wife, was accused to have been\r\nconscious of all this, and had resolved to conceal it; for which reason\r\nHerod divorced her, and blotted her son out of his testament, wherein he\r\nhad been mentioned as one that was to reign after him; and he took the\r\nhigh priesthood away from his father-in-law, Simeon the son of Boethus,\r\nand appointed Matthias the son of Theophilus, who was born at Jerusalem,\r\nto be high priest in his room.\r\n\r\n3. While this was doing, Bathyllus also, Antipater's freed-man, came\r\nfrom Rome, and, upon the torture, was found to have brought another\r\npotion, to give it into the hands of Antipater's mother, and of\r\nPheroras, that if the former potion did not operate upon the king, this\r\nat least might carry him off. There came also letters from Herod's\r\nfriends at Rome, by the approbation and at the suggestion of Antipater,\r\nto accuse Archelaus and Philip, as if they calumniated their father on\r\naccount of the slaughter of Alexander and Aristobulus, and as if they\r\ncommiserated their deaths, and as if, because they were sent for home,\r\n[for their father had already recalled them,] they concluded they were\r\nthemselves also to be destroyed. These letters had been procured by\r\ngreat rewards by Antipater's friends; but Antipater himself wrote to his\r\nfather about them, and laid the heaviest things to their charge; yet did\r\nhe entirely excuse them of any guilt, and said they were but young men,\r\nand so imputed their words to their youth. But he said that he had\r\nhimself been very busy in the affair relating to Sylleus, and in getting\r\ninterest among the great men; and on that account had bought splendid\r\nornaments to present them withal, which cost him two hundred talents.\r\nNow one may wonder how it came about, that while so many accusations\r\nwere laid against him in Judea during seven months before this time, he\r\nwas not made acquainted with any of them. The causes of which were, that\r\nthe roads were exactly guarded, and that men hated Antipater; for there\r\nwas nobody who would run any hazard himself to gain him any advantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. Antipater's Navigation From Rome To His Father; And How He\r\nWas Accused By Nicolaus Of Damascus And Condemned To Die By His Father,\r\nAnd By Quintilius Varus, Who Was Then President Of Syria; And How He Was\r\nThen Bound Till Cæsar Should Be Informed Of His Cause.\r\n\r\n1. Now Herod, upon Antipater's writing to him, that having done all that\r\nhe was to do, and this in the manner he was to do it, he would suddenly\r\ncome to him, concealed his anger against him, and wrote back to him, and\r\nbid him not delay his journey, lest any harm should befall himself in\r\nhis absence. At the same time also he made some little complaint about\r\nhis mother, but promised that he would lay those complaints aside when\r\nhe should return. He withal expressed his entire affection for him, as\r\nfearing lest he should have some suspicion of him, and defer his journey\r\nto him; and lest, while he lived at Rome, he should lay plots for the\r\nkingdom, and, moreover, do somewhat against himself. This letter\r\nAntipater met with in Cilicia; but had received an account of Pheroras's\r\ndeath before at Tarentum. This last news affected him deeply; not out of\r\nany affection for Pheroras, but because he was dead without having\r\nmurdered his father, which he had promised him to do. And when he was at\r\nCelenderis in Cilicia, he began to deliberate with himself about his\r\nsailing home, as being much grieved with the ejection of his mother. Now\r\nsome of his friends advised him that he should tarry a while some where,\r\nin expectation of further information. But others advised him to sail\r\nhome without delay; for that if he were once come thither, he would soon\r\nput an end to all accusations, and that nothing afforded any weight to\r\nhis accusers at present but his absence. He was persuaded by these last,\r\nand sailed on, and landed at the haven called Sebastus, which Herod had\r\nbuilt at vast expenses in honor of Cæsar, and called Sebastus. And now\r\nwas Antipater evidently in a miserable condition, while nobody came to\r\nhim nor saluted him, as they did at his going away, with good wishes of\r\njoyful acclamations; nor was there now any thing to hinder them from\r\nentertaining him, on the contrary, with bitter curses, while they\r\nsupposed he was come to receive his punishment for the murder of his\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\n2. Now Quintilius Varus was at this time at Jerusalem, being sent to\r\nsucceed Saturninus as president of Syria, and was come as an assessor to\r\nHerod, who had desired his advice in his present affairs; and as they\r\nwere sitting together, Antipater came upon them, without knowing any\r\nthing of the matter; so he came into the palace clothed in purple. The\r\nporters indeed received him in, but excluded his friends. And now he was\r\nin great disorder, and presently understood the condition he was in,\r\nwhile, upon his going to salute his father, he was repulsed by him, who\r\ncalled him a murderer of his brethren, and a plotter of destruction\r\nagainst himself, and told him that Varus should be his auditor and his\r\njudge the very next day; so he found that what misfortunes he now heard\r\nof were already upon him, with the greatness of which he went away in\r\nconfusion; upon which his mother and his wife met him, [which wife was\r\nthe daughter of Antigonus, who was king of the Jews before Herod,] from\r\nwhom he learned all circumstances which concerned him, and then prepared\r\nhimself for his trial.\r\n\r\n3. On the next day Varus and the king sat together in judgment, and both\r\ntheir friends were also called in, as also the king's relations, with\r\nhis sister Salome, and as many as could discover any thing, and such as\r\nhad been tortured; and besides these, some slaves of Antipater's mother,\r\nwho were taken up a little before Antipater's coming, and brought with\r\nthem a written letter, the sum of which was this: That he should not\r\ncome back, because all was come to his father's knowledge; and that\r\nCæsar was the only refuge he had left to prevent both his and her\r\ndelivery into his father's hands. Then did Antipater fall down at his\r\nfather's feet, and besought him not to prejudge his cause, but that he\r\nmight be first heard by his father, and that his father would keep\r\nhimself unprejudiced. So Herod ordered him to be brought into the midst,\r\nand then lamented himself about his children, from whom he had suffered\r\nsuch great misfortunes; and because Antipater fell upon him in his old\r\nage. He also reckoned up what maintenance and what education he had\r\ngiven them; and what seasonable supplies of wealth he had afforded them,\r\naccording to their own desires; none of which favors had hindered them\r\nfrom contriving against him, and from bringing his very life into\r\ndanger, in order to gain his kingdom, after an impious manner, by taking\r\naway his life before the course of nature, their father's wishes, or\r\njustice required that that kingdom should come to them; and that he\r\nwondered what hopes could elevate Antipater to such a pass as to be\r\nhardy enough to attempt such things; that he had by his testament in\r\nwriting declared him his successor in the government; and while he was\r\nalive, he was in no respect inferior to him, either in his illustrious\r\ndignity, or in power and authority, he having no less than fifty talents\r\nfor his yearly income, and had received for his journey to Rome no fewer\r\nthan thirty talents. He also objected to him the case of his brethren\r\nwhom he had accused; and if they were guilty, he had imitated their\r\nexample; and if not, he had brought him groundless accusations against\r\nhis near relations; for that he had been acquainted with all those\r\nthings by him, and by nobody else, and had done what was done by his\r\napprobation, and whom he now absolved from all that was criminal, by\r\nbecoming the inheritor of the guilt of such their parricide.\r\n\r\n4. When Herod had thus spoken, he fell a weeping, and was not able to\r\nsay any more; but at his desire Nicolaus of Damascus, being the king's\r\nfriend, and always conversant with him, and acquainted with whatsoever\r\nhe did, and with the circumstances of his affairs, proceeded to what\r\nremained, and explained all that concerned the demonstrations and\r\nevidences of the facts. Upon which Antipater, in order to make his legal\r\ndefense, turned himself to his father, and enlarged upon the many\r\nindications he had given of his good-will to him; and instanced in the\r\nhonors that had been done him, which yet had not been done, had he not\r\ndeserved them by his virtuous concern about him; for that he had made\r\nprovision for every thing that was fit to be foreseen beforehand, as to\r\ngiving him his wisest advice; and whenever there was occasion for the\r\nlabor of his own hands, he had not grudged any such pains for him. And\r\nthat it was almost impossible that he, who had delivered his father from\r\nso many treacherous contrivances laid against him, should be himself in\r\na plot against him, and so lose all the reputation he had gained for his\r\nvirtue, by his wickedness which succeeded it; and this while he had\r\nnothing to prohibit him, who was already appointed his successor, to\r\nenjoy the royal honor with his father also at present; and that there\r\nwas no likelihood that a person who had the one half of that authority\r\nwithout any danger, and with a good character, should hunt after the\r\nwhole with infamy and danger, and this when it was doubtful whether he\r\ncould obtain it or not; and when he saw the sad example of his brethren\r\nbefore him, and was both the informer and the accuser against them, at a\r\ntime when they might not otherwise have been discovered; nay, was the\r\nauthor of the punishment inflicted upon them, when it appeared evidently\r\nthat they were guilty of a wicked attempt against their father; and that\r\neven the contentions there were in the king's family were indications\r\nthat he had ever managed affairs out of the sincerest affection to his\r\nfather. And as to what he had done at Rome, Cæsar was a witness thereto,\r\nwho yet was no more to be imposed upon than God himself; of whose\r\nopinions his letters sent hither are sufficient evidence; and that it\r\nwas not reasonable to prefer the calumnies of such as proposed to raise\r\ndisturbances before those letters; the greatest part of which calumnies\r\nhad been raised during his absence, which gave scope to his enemies to\r\nforge them, which they had not been able to do if he had been there.\r\nMoreover he showed the weakness of the evidence obtained by torture,\r\nwhich was commonly false, because the distress men are in under such\r\ntortures naturally obliges them to say many things in order to please\r\nthose that govern them. He also offered himself to the torture.\r\n\r\n5. Hereupon there was a change observed in the assembly, while they\r\ngreatly pitied Antipater, who by weeping and putting on a countenance\r\nsuitable to his sad case made them commiserate the same, insomuch that\r\nhis very enemies were moved to compassion; and it appeared plainly that\r\nHerod himself was affected in his own mind, although he was not willing\r\nit should be taken notice of. Then did Nicolaus begin to prosecute what\r\nthe king had begun, and that with great bitterness; and summed up all\r\nthe evidence which arose from the tortures, or from the testimonies. He\r\nprincipally and largely cried up the king's virtues, which he had\r\nexhibited in the maintenance and education of his sons; while he never\r\ncould gain any advantage thereby, but still fell from one misfortune to\r\nanother. Although he owned that he was not so much surprised with that\r\nthoughtless behavior of his former sons, who were but young, and were\r\nbesides corrupted by wicked counselors, who were the occasion of their\r\nwiping out of their minds the righteous dictates of nature, and this out\r\nof a desire of coming to the government sooner than they ought to do;\r\nyet that he could not but justly stand amazed at the horrid wickedness\r\nof Antipater, who, although he had not only had great benefits bestowed\r\non him by his father, enough to tame his reason, yet could not be more\r\ntamed than the most envenomed serpents; whereas even those creatures\r\nadmit of some mitigation, and will not bite their benefactors, while\r\nAntipater hath not let the misfortunes of his brethren be any hinderance\r\nto him, but he hath gone on to imitate their barbarity notwithstanding.\r\n\"Yet wast thou, O Antipater! [as thou hast thyself confessed,] the\r\ninformer as to what wicked actions they had done, and the searcher out\r\nof the evidence against them, and the author of the punishment they\r\nunderwent upon their detection. Nor do we say this as accusing thee for\r\nbeing so zealous in thy anger against them, but are astonished at thy\r\nendeavors to imitate their profligate behavior; and we discover thereby\r\nthat thou didst not act thus for the safety of thy father, but for the\r\ndestruction of thy brethren, that by such outside hatred of their\r\nimpiety thou mightest be believed a lover of thy father, and mightest\r\nthereby get thee power enough to do mischief with the greatest impunity;\r\nwhich design thy actions indeed demonstrate. It is true, thou tookest\r\nthy brethren off, because thou didst convict theft of their wicked\r\ndesigns; but thou didst not yield up to justice those who were their\r\npartners; and thereby didst make it evident to all men that thou madest\r\na covenant with them against thy father, when thou chosest to be the\r\naccuser of thy brethren, as desirous to gain to thyself alone this\r\nadvantage of laying plots to kill thy father, and so to enjoy double\r\npleasure, which is truly worthy of thy evil disposition, which thou has\r\nopenly showed against thy brethren; on which account thou didst rejoice,\r\nas having done a most famous exploit, nor was that behavior unworthy of\r\nthee. But if thy intention were otherwise, thou art worse than they:\r\nwhile thou didst contrive to hide thy treachery against thy father, thou\r\ndidst hate them, not as plotters against thy father, for in that case\r\nthou hadst not thyself fallen upon the like crime, but as successors of\r\nhis dominions, and more worthy of that succession than thyself. Thou\r\nwouldst kill thy father after thy brethren, lest thy lies raised against\r\nthem might be detected; and lest thou shouldst suffer what punishment\r\nthou hadst deserved, thou hadst a mind to exact that punishment of thy\r\nunhappy father, and didst devise such a sort of uncommon parricide as\r\nthe world never yet saw. For thou who art his son didst not only lay a\r\ntreacherous design against thy father, and didst it while he loved thee,\r\nand had been thy benefactor, had made thee in reality his partner in the\r\nkingdom, and had openly declared thee his successor, while thou wast not\r\nforbidden to taste the sweetness of authority already, and hadst the\r\nfirm hope of what was future by thy father's determination, and the\r\nsecurity of a written testament; but, for certain, thou didst not\r\nmeasure these things according to thy father's various disposition, but\r\naccording to thy own thoughts and inclinations; and was desirous to take\r\nthe part that remained away from thy too indulgent father, and soughtest\r\nto destroy him with thy deeds, whom thou in words pretendedst to\r\npreserve. Nor wast thou content to be wicked thyself, but thou filledst\r\nthy mother's head with thy devices, and raised disturbances among thy\r\nbrethren, and hadst the boldness to call thy father a wild beast; while\r\nthou hadst thyself a mind more cruel than any serpent, whence thou\r\nsentest out that poison among thy nearest kindred and greatest\r\nbenefactors, and invitedst them to assist thee and guard thee, and didst\r\nhedge thyself in on all sides, by the artifices of both men and women,\r\nagainst an old man, as though that mind of thine was not sufficient of\r\nitself to support so great a hatred as thou baredst to him. And here\r\nthou appearest, after the tortures of free-men, of domestics, of men and\r\nwomen, which have been examined on thy account, and after the\r\ninformations of thy fellow conspirators, as making haste to contradict\r\nthe truth; and hast thought on ways not only how to take thy father out\r\nof the world, but to disannul that written law which is against thee,\r\nand the virtue of Varus, and the nature of justice; nay, such is that\r\nimpudence of thine on which thou confidest, that thou desirest to be put\r\nto the torture thyself, while thou allegest that the tortures of those\r\nalready examined thereby have made them tell lies; that those that have\r\nbeen the deliverers of thy father may not be allowed to have spoken the\r\ntruth; but that thy tortures may be esteemed the discoverers of truth.\r\nWilt not thou, O Varus! deliver the king from the injuries of his\r\nkindred? Wilt not thou destroy this wicked wild beast, which hath\r\npretended kindness to his father, in order to destroy his brethren;\r\nwhile yet he is himself alone ready to carry off the kingdom\r\nimmediately, and appears to be the most bloody butcher to him of them\r\nall? for thou art sensible that parricide is a general injury both to\r\nnature and to common life, and that the intention of parricide is not\r\ninferior to its perpetration; and he who does not punish it is injurious\r\nto nature itself.\"\r\n\r\n6. Nicolaus added further what belonged to Antipater's mother, and\r\nwhatsoever she had prattled like a woman; as also about the predictions\r\nand the sacrifices relating to the king; and whatsoever Antipater had\r\ndone lasciviously in his cups and his amours among Pheroras's women; the\r\nexamination upon torture; and whatsoever concerned the testimonies of\r\nthe witnesses, which were many, and of various kinds; some prepared\r\nbeforehand, and others were sudden answers, which further declared and\r\nconfirmed the foregoing evidence. For those men who were not acquainted\r\nwith Antipater's practices, but had concealed them out of fear, when\r\nthey saw that he was exposed to the accusations of the former witnesses,\r\nand that his great good fortune, which had supported him hitherto, had\r\nnow evidently betrayed him into the hands of his enemies, who were now\r\ninsatiable in their hatred to him, told all they knew of him. And his\r\nruin was now hastened, not so much by the enmity of those that were his\r\naccusers, as by his gross, and impudent, and wicked contrivances, and by\r\nhis ill-will to his father and his brethren; while he had filled their\r\nhouse with disturbance, and caused them to murder one another; and was\r\nneither fair in his hatred, nor kind in his friendship, but just so far\r\nas served his own turn. Now there were a great number who for a long\r\ntime beforehand had seen all this, and especially such as were naturally\r\ndisposed to judge of matters by the rules of virtue, because they were\r\nused to determine about affairs without passion, but had been restrained\r\nfrom making any open complaints before; these, upon the leave now given\r\nthem, produced all that they knew before the public. The demonstrations\r\nalso of these wicked facts could no way be disproved, because the many\r\nwitnesses there were did neither speak out of favor to Herod, nor were\r\nthey obliged to keep what they had to say silent, out of suspicion of\r\nany danger they were in; but they spake what they knew, because they\r\nthought such actions very wicked, and that Antipater deserved the\r\ngreatest punishment; and indeed not so much for Herod's safety, as on\r\naccount of the man's own wickedness. Many things were also said, and\r\nthose by a great number of persons, who were no way obliged to say them,\r\ninsomuch that Antipater, who used generally to be very shrewd in his\r\nlies and impudence, was not able to say one word to the contrary. When\r\nNicolaus had left off speaking, and had produced the evidence, Varus bid\r\nAntipater to betake himself to the making his defense, if he had\r\nprepared any thing whereby it might appear that he was not guilty of the\r\ncrimes he was accused of; for that, as he was himself desirous, so did\r\nhe know that his father was in like manner desirous also, to have him\r\nfound entirely innocent. But Antipater fell down on his face, and\r\nappealed to God and to all men for testimonials of his innocency,\r\ndesiring that God would declare, by some evident signals, that he had\r\nnot laid any plot against his father. This being the usual method of all\r\nmen destitute of virtue, that when they set about any wicked\r\nundertakings, they fall to work according to their own inclinations, as\r\nif they believed that God was unconcerned in human affairs; but when\r\nonce they are found out, and are in danger of undergoing the punishment\r\ndue to their crimes, they endeavor to overthrow all the evidence against\r\nthem by appealing to God; which was the very thing which Antipater now\r\ndid; for whereas he had done everything as if there were no God in the\r\nworld, when he was on all sides distressed by justice, and when he had\r\nno other advantage to expect from any legal proofs, by which he might\r\ndisprove the accusations laid against him, he impudently abused the\r\nmajesty of God, and ascribed it to his power that he had been preserved\r\nhitherto; and produced before them all what difficulties he had ever\r\nundergone in his bold acting for his father's preservation.\r\n\r\n7. So when Varus, upon asking Antipater what he had to say for himself,\r\nfound that he had nothing to say besides his appeal to God, and saw that\r\nthere was no end of that, he bid them bring the potion before the court,\r\nthat he might see what virtue still remained in it; and when it was\r\nbrought, and one that was condemned to die had drank it by Varus's\r\ncommand, he died presently. Then Varus got up, and departed out of the\r\ncourt, and went away the day following to Antioch, where his usual\r\nresidence was, because that was the palace of the Syrians; upon which\r\nHerod laid his son in bonds. But what were Varus's discourses to Herod\r\nwas not known to the generality, and upon what words it was that he went\r\naway; though it was also generally supposed that whatsoever Herod did\r\nafterward about his son was done with his approbation. But when Herod\r\nhad bound his son, he sent letters to Rome to Cæsar about him, and such\r\nmessengers withal as should, by word of mouth, inform Cæsar of\r\nAntipater's wickedness. Now at this very time there was seized a letter\r\nof Antiphilus, written to Antipater out of Egypt [for he lived there];\r\nand when it was opened by the king, it was found to contain what\r\nfollows: \"I have sent thee Acme's letter, and hazarded my own life; for\r\nthou knowest that I am in danger from two families, if I be discovered.\r\nI wish thee good success in thy affair.\" These were the contents of this\r\nletter; but the king made inquiry about the other letter also, for it\r\ndid not appear; and Antiphilus's slave, who brought that letter which\r\nhad been read, denied that he had received the other. But while the king\r\nwas in doubt about it, one of Herod's friends seeing a seam upon the\r\ninner coat of the slave, and a doubling of the cloth, [for he had two\r\ncoats on,] he guessed that the letter might be within that doubling;\r\nwhich accordingly proved to be true. So they took out the letter, and\r\nits contents were these: \"Acme to Antipater. I have written such a\r\nletter to thy father as thou desiredst me. I have also taken a copy and\r\nsent it, as if it came from Salome, to my lady [Livia]; which, when thou\r\nreadest, I know that Herod Will punish Salome, as plotting against him?'\r\nNow this pretended letter of Salome to her lady was composed by\r\nAntipater, in the name of Salome, as to its meaning, but in the words of\r\nAcme. The letter was this: 'Acme to king Herod. I have done my endeavor\r\nthat nothing that is done against thee should be concealed from thee.\r\nSo, upon my finding a letter of Salome written to my lady against thee,\r\nI have written out a copy, and sent it to thee; with hazard to myself,\r\nbut for thy advantage.' The reason why she wrote it was this, that she\r\nhad a mind to be married to Sylleus. Do thou therefore tear this letter\r\nin pieces, that I may not come into danger of my life.\" Now Acme had\r\nwritten to Antipater himself, and informed him, that, in compliance with\r\nhis command, she had both herself written to Herod, as if Salome had\r\nlaid a sudden plot entirely against him, and had herself sent a copy of\r\nan epistle, as coming from Salome to her lady. Now Acme was a Jew by\r\nbirth, and a servant to Julia, Cæsar's wife; and did this out of her\r\nfriendship for Antipater, as having been corrupted by him with a large\r\npresent of money, to assist in his pernicious designs against his father\r\nand his aunt.\r\n\r\n8. Hereupon Herod was so amazed at the prodigious wickedness of\r\nAntipater, that he was ready to have ordered him to be slain\r\nimmediately, as a turbulent person in the most important concerns, and\r\nas one that had laid a plot not only against himself, but against his\r\nsister also, and even corrupted Cæsar's own domestics. Salome also\r\nprovoked him to it, beating her breast, and bidding him kill her, if he\r\ncould produce any credible testimony that she had acted in that manner.\r\nHerod also sent for his son, and asked him about this matter, and bid\r\nhim contradict if he could, and not suppress any thing he had to say for\r\nhimself; and when he had not one word to say, he asked him, since he was\r\nevery way caught in his villainy, that he would make no further delay,\r\nbut discover his associates in these his wicked designs. So he laid all\r\nupon Antiphilus, but discovered nobody else. Hereupon Herod was in such\r\ngreat grief, that he was ready to send his son to Rome to Cæsar, there\r\nto give an account of these his wicked contrivances. But he soon became\r\nafraid, lest he might there, by the assistance of his friends, escape\r\nthe danger he was in; so he kept him bound as before, and sent more\r\nambassadors and letters [to Rome] to accuse his son, and an account of\r\nwhat assistance Acme had given him in his wicked designs, with copies of\r\nthe epistles before mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. Concerning The Disease That Herod Fell Into And The Sedition\r\nWhich The Jews Raised Thereupon; With The Punishment Of The Seditious.\r\n\r\n1. Now Herod's ambassadors made haste to Rome; but sent, as instructed\r\nbeforehand, what answers they were to make to the questions put to them.\r\nThey also carried the epistles with them. But Herod now fell into a\r\ndistemper, and made his will, and bequeathed his kingdom to [Antipas],\r\nhis youngest son; and this out of that hatred to Archelaus and Philip,\r\nwhich the calumnies of Antipater had raised against them. He also\r\nbequeathed a thousand talents to Cæsar, and five hundred to Julia,\r\nCæsar's wife, to Cæsar's children, and friends and freed-men. He also\r\ndistributed among his sons and their sons his money, his revenues, and\r\nhis lands. He also made Salome his sister very rich, because she had\r\ncontinued faithful to him in all his circumstances, and was never so\r\nrash as to do him any harm; and as he despaired of recovering, for he\r\nwas about the seventieth year of his age, he grew fierce, and indulged\r\nthe bitterest anger upon all occasions; the cause whereof was this, that\r\nhe thought himself despised, and that the nation was pleased with his\r\nmisfortunes; besides which, he resented a sedition which some of the\r\nlower sort of men excited against him, the occasion of which was as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n2. There was one Judas, the son of Saripheus, and Matthias, the son of\r\nMargalothus, two of the most eloquent men among the Jews, and the most\r\ncelebrated interpreters of the Jewish laws, and men well beloved by the\r\npeople, because of their education of their youth; for all those that\r\nwere studious of virtue frequented their lectures every day. These men,\r\nwhen they found that the king's distemper was incurable, excited the\r\nyoung men that they would pull down all those works which the king had\r\nerected contrary to the law of their fathers, and thereby obtain the\r\nrewards which the law will confer on them for such actions of piety; for\r\nthat it was truly on account of Herod's rashness in making such things\r\nas the law had forbidden, that his other misfortunes, and this distemper\r\nalso, which was so unusual among mankind, and with which he was now\r\nafflicted, came upon him; for Herod had caused such things to be made\r\nwhich were contrary to the law, of which he was accused by Judas and\r\nMatthias; for the king had erected over the great gate of the temple a\r\nlarge golden eagle, of great value, and had dedicated it to the temple.\r\nNow the law forbids those that propose to live according to it, to erect\r\nimages 6 or representations of any living creature. So these wise men\r\npersuaded [their scholars] to pull down the golden eagle; alleging, that\r\nalthough they should incur any danger, which might bring them to their\r\ndeaths, the virtue of the action now proposed to them would appear much\r\nmore advantageous to them than the pleasures of life; since they would\r\ndie for the preservation and observation of the law of their fathers;\r\nsince they would also acquire an everlasting fame and commendation;\r\nsince they would be both commended by the present generation, and leave\r\nan example of life that would never be forgotten to posterity; since\r\nthat common calamity of dying cannot be avoided by our living so as to\r\nescape any such dangers; that therefore it is a right thing for those\r\nwho are in love with a virtuous conduct, to wait for that fatal hour by\r\nsuch behavior as may carry them out of the world with praise and honor;\r\nand that this will alleviate death to a great degree, thus to come at it\r\nby the performance of brave actions, which bring us into danger of it;\r\nand at the same time to leave that reputation behind them to their\r\nchildren, and to all their relations, whether they be men or women,\r\nwhich will be of great advantage to them afterward.\r\n\r\n3. And with such discourses as this did these men excite the young men\r\nto this action; and a report being come to them that the king was dead,\r\nthis was an addition to the wise men's persuasions; so, in the very\r\nmiddle of the day, they got upon the place, they pulled down the eagle,\r\nand cut it into pieces with axes, while a great number of the people\r\nwere in the temple. And now the king's captain, upon hearing what the\r\nundertaking was, and supposing it was a thing of a higher nature than it\r\nproved to be, came up thither, having a great band of soldiers with him,\r\nsuch as was sufficient to put a stop to the multitude of those who\r\npulled down what was dedicated to God; so he fell upon them\r\nunexpectedly, and as they were upon this bold attempt, in a foolish\r\npresumption rather than a cautious circumspection, as is usual with the\r\nmultitude, and while they were in disorder, and incautious of what was\r\nfor their advantage; so he caught no fewer than forty of the young men,\r\nwho had the courage to stay behind when the rest ran away, together with\r\nthe authors of this bold attempt, Judas and Matthias, who thought it an\r\nignominious thing to retire upon his approach, and led them to the king.\r\nAnd when they were come to the king, and he asked them if they had been\r\nso bold as to pull down what he had dedicated to God, \"Yes, [said they,]\r\nwhat was contrived we contrived, and what hath been performed we\r\nperformed it, and that with such a virtuous courage as becomes men; for\r\nwe have given our assistance to those things which were dedicated to the\r\nmajesty of God, and we have provided for what we have learned by hearing\r\nthe law; and it ought not to be wondered at, if we esteem those laws\r\nwhich Moses had suggested to him, and were taught him by God, and which\r\nhe wrote and left behind him, more worthy of observation than thy\r\ncommands. Accordingly we will undergo death, and all sorts of\r\npunishments which thou canst inflict upon us, with pleasure, since we\r\nare conscious to ourselves that we shall die, not for any unrighteous\r\nactions, but for our love to religion.\" And thus they all said, and\r\ntheir courage was still equal to their profession, and equal to that\r\nwith which they readily set about this undertaking. And when the king\r\nhad ordered them to be bound, he sent them to Jericho, and called\r\ntogether the principal men among the Jews; and when they were come, he\r\nmade them assemble in the theater, and because he could not himself\r\nstand, he lay upon a couch, and enumerated the many labors that he had\r\nlong endured on their account, and his building of the temple, and what\r\na vast charge that was to him; while the Asamoneans, during the hundred\r\nand twenty-five years of their government, had not been able to perform\r\nany so great a work for the honor of God as that was; that he had also\r\nadorned it with very valuable donations, on which account he hoped that\r\nhe had left himself a memorial, and procured himself a reputation after\r\nhis death. He then cried out, that these men had not abstained from\r\naffronting him, even in his lifetime, but that in the very day time, and\r\nin the sight of the multitude, they had abused him to that degree, as to\r\nfall upon what he had dedicated, and in that way of abuse had pulled it\r\ndown to the ground. They pretended, indeed, that they did it to affront\r\nhim; but if any one consider the thing truly, they will find that they\r\nwere guilty of sacrilege against God therein.\r\n\r\n4. But the people, on account of Herod's barbarous temper, and for fear\r\nhe should be so cruel and to inflict punishment on them, said what was\r\ndone was done without their approbation, and that it seemed to them that\r\nthe actors might well be punished for what they had done. But as for\r\nHerod, he dealt more mildly with others [of the assembly] but he\r\ndeprived Matthias of the high priesthood, as in part an occasion of this\r\naction, and made Joazar, who was Matthias's wife's brother, high priest\r\nin his stead. Now it happened, that during the time of the high\r\npriesthood of this Matthias, there was another person made high priest\r\nfor a single day, that very day which the Jews observed as a fast. The\r\noccasion was this: This Matthias the high priest, on the night before\r\nthat day when the fast was to be celebrated, seemed, in a dream, 7 to\r\nhave conversation with his wife; and because he could not officiate\r\nhimself on that account, Joseph, the son of Ellemus, his kinsman,\r\nassisted him in that sacred office. But Herod deprived this Matthias of\r\nthe high priesthood, and burnt the other Matthias, who had raised the\r\nsedition, with his companions, alive. And that very night there was an\r\neclipse of the moon. 8\r\n\r\n5. But now Herod's distemper greatly increased upon him after a severe\r\nmanner, and this by God's judgment upon him for his sins; for a fire\r\nglowed in him slowly, which did not so much appear to the touch\r\noutwardly, as it augmented his pains inwardly; for it brought upon him a\r\nvehement appetite to eating, which he could not avoid to supply with one\r\nsort of food or other. His entrails were also ex-ulcerated, and the\r\nchief violence of his pain lay on his colon; an aqueous and transparent\r\nliquor also had settled itself about his feet, and a like matter\r\nafflicted him at the bottom of his belly. Nay, further, his privy-member\r\nwas putrefied, and produced worms; and when he sat upright, he had a\r\ndifficulty of breathing, which was very loathsome, on account of the\r\nstench of his breath, and the quickness of its returns; he had also\r\nconvulsions in all parts of his body, which increased his strength to an\r\ninsufferable degree. It was said by those who pretended to divine, and\r\nwho were endued with wisdom to foretell such things, that God inflicted\r\nthis punishment on the king on account of his great impiety; yet was he\r\nstill in hopes of recovering, though his afflictions seemed greater than\r\nany one could bear. He also sent for physicians, and did not refuse to\r\nfollow what they prescribed for his assistance, and went beyond the\r\nriver Jordan, and bathed himself in the warm baths that were at\r\nCallirrhoe, which, besides their other general virtues, were also fit to\r\ndrink; which water runs into the lake called Asphaltiris. And when the\r\nphysicians once thought fit to have him bathed in a vessel full of oil,\r\nit was supposed that he was just dying; but upon the lamentable cries of\r\nhis domestics, he revived; and having no longer the least hopes of\r\nrecovering, he gave order that every soldier should be paid fifty\r\ndrachmae; and he also gave a great deal to their commanders, and to his\r\nfriends, and came again to Jericho, where he grew so choleric, that it\r\nbrought him to do all things like a madman; and though he were near his\r\ndeath, he contrived the following wicked designs. He commanded that all\r\nthe principal men of the entire Jewish nation, wheresoever they lived,\r\nshould be called to him. Accordingly, they were a great number that\r\ncame, because the whole nation was called, and all men heard of this\r\ncall, and death was the penalty of such as should despise the epistles\r\nthat were sent to call them. And now the king was in a wild rage against\r\nthem all, the innocent as well as those that had afforded ground for\r\naccusations; and when they were come, he ordered them to be all shut up\r\nin the hyppodrome, 9 and sent for his sister Salome, and her husband\r\nAlexas, and spake thus to them: \"I shall die in a little time, so great\r\nare my pains; which death ought to be cheerfully borne, and to be\r\nwelcomed by all men; but what principally troubles me is this, that I\r\nshall die without being lamented, and without such mourning as men\r\nusually expect at a king's death.\" For that he was not unacquainted with\r\nthe temper of the Jews, that his death would be a thing very desirable,\r\nand exceedingly acceptable to them, because during his lifetime they\r\nwere ready to revolt from him, and to abuse the donations he had\r\ndedicated to God that it therefore was their business to resolve to\r\nafford him some alleviation of his great sorrows on this occasion; for\r\nthat if they do not refuse him their consent in what he desires, he\r\nshall have a great mourning at his funeral, and such as never had any\r\nking before him; for then the whole nation would mourn from their very\r\nsoul, which otherwise would be done in sport and mockery only. He\r\ndesired therefore, that as soon as they see he hath given up the ghost,\r\nthey shall place soldiers round the hippodrome, while they do not know\r\nthat he is dead; and that they shall not declare his death to the\r\nmultitude till this is done, but that they shall give orders to have\r\nthose that are in custody shot with their darts; and that this slaughter\r\nof them all will cause that he shall not miss to rejoice on a double\r\naccount; that as he is dying, they will make him secure that his will\r\nshall be executed in what he charges them to do; and that he shall have\r\nthe honor of a memorable mourning at his funeral. So he deplored his\r\ncondition, with tears in his eyes, and obtested them by the kindness due\r\nfrom them, as of his kindred, and by the faith they owed to God, and\r\nbegged of them that they would not hinder him of this honorable mourning\r\nat his funeral. So they promised him not to transgress his commands.\r\n\r\n6. Now any one may easily discover the temper of this man's mind, which\r\nnot only took pleasure in doing what he had done formerly against his\r\nrelations, out of the love of life, but by those commands of his which\r\nsavored of no humanity; since he took care, when he was departing out of\r\nthis life, that the whole nation should be put into mourning, and indeed\r\nmade desolate of their dearest kindred, when he gave order that one out\r\nof every family should be slain, although they had done nothing that was\r\nunjust, or that was against him, nor were they accused of any other\r\ncrimes; while it is usual for those who have any regard to virtue to lay\r\naside their hatred at such a time, even with respect to those they\r\njustly esteemed their enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. Herod Has Thoughts Of Killing Himself With His Own Hand; And\r\nA Little Afterwards He Orders Antipater To Be Slain.\r\n\r\n1. As he was giving these commands to his relations, there came letters\r\nfrom his ambassadors, who had been sent to Rome unto Cæsar, which, when\r\nthey were read, their purport was this: That Acme was slain by Cæsar,\r\nout of his indignation at what hand, she had in Antipater's wicked\r\npractices; and that as to Antipater himself, Cæsar left it to Herod to\r\nact as became a father and a king, and either to banish him, or to take\r\naway his life, which he pleased. When Herod heard this, he was some-\r\nwhat better, out of the pleasure he had from the contents of the\r\nletters, and was elevated at the death of Acme, and at the power that\r\nwas given him over his son; but as his pains were become very great, he\r\nwas now ready to faint for want of somewhat to eat; so he called for an\r\napple and a knife; for it was his custom formerly to pare the apple\r\nhimself, and soon afterwards to cut it, and eat it. When he had got the\r\nknife, he looked about, and had a mind to stab himself with it; and he\r\nhad done it, had not his first cousin, Achiabus, prevented him, and held\r\nhis hand, and cried out loudly. Whereupon a woeful lamentation echoed\r\nthrough the palace, and a great tumult was made, as if the king were\r\ndead. Upon which Antipater, who verily believed his father was deceased,\r\ngrew bold in his discourse, as hoping to be immediately and entirely\r\nreleased from his bonds, and to take the kingdom into his hands without\r\nany more ado; so he discoursed with the jailer about letting him go, and\r\nin that case promised him great things, both now and hereafter, as if\r\nthat were the only thing now in question. But the jailer did not only\r\nrefuse to do what Antipater would have him, but informed the king of his\r\nintentions, and how many solicitations he had had from him [of that\r\nnature]. Hereupon Herod, who had formerly no affection nor good-will\r\ntowards his son to restrain him, when he heard what the jailer said, he\r\ncried out, and beat his head, although he was at death's door, and\r\nraised himself upon his elbow, and sent for some of his guards, and\r\ncommanded them to kill Antipater without tiny further delay, and to do\r\nit presently, and to bury him in an ignoble manner at Hyrcania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. Concerning Herod's Death, And Testament, And Burial.\r\n\r\n1. And now Herod altered his testament upon the alteration of his mind;\r\nfor he appointed Antipas, to whom he had before left the kingdom, to be\r\ntetrarch of Galilee and Perea, and granted the kingdom to Archelaus. He\r\nalso gave Gaulonitis, and Trachonitis, and Paneas to Philip, who was his\r\nson, but own brother to Archelaus 10 by the name of a tetrarchy; and\r\nbequeathed Jarnnia, and Ashdod, and Phasaelis to Salome his sister, with\r\nfive hundred thousand [drachmae] of silver that was coined. He also made\r\nprovision for all the rest of his kindred, by giving them sums of money\r\nand annual revenues, and so left them all in a wealthy condition. He\r\nbequeathed also to Cæsar ten millions [of drachmae] of coined money,\r\nbesides both vessels of gold and silver, and garments exceeding costly,\r\nto Julia, Cæsar's wife; and to certain others, five millions. When he\r\nhad done these things, he died, the fifth day after he had caused\r\nAntipater to be slain; having reigned, since he had procured Antigonus\r\nto be slain, thirty-four years; but since he had been declared king by\r\nthe Romans, thirty-seven. 11 A man he was of great barbarity towards all\r\nmen equally, and a slave to his passion; but above the consideration of\r\nwhat was right; yet was he favored by fortune as much as any man ever\r\nwas, for from a private man he became a king; and though he were\r\nencompassed with ten thousand dangers, he got clear of them all, and\r\ncontinued his life till a very old age. But then, as to the affairs of\r\nhis family and children, in which indeed, according to his own opinion,\r\nhe was also very fortunate, because he was able to conquer his enemies,\r\nyet, in my opinion, he was herein very unfortunate.\r\n\r\n2. But then Salome and Alexas, before the king's death was made known,\r\ndismissed those that were shut up in the hippodrome, and told them that\r\nthe king ordered them to go away to their own lands, and take care of\r\ntheir own affairs, which was esteemed by the nation a great benefit. And\r\nnow the king's death was made public, when Salome and Alexas gathered\r\nthe soldiery together in the amphitheater at Jericho; and the first\r\nthing they did was, they read Herod's letter, written to the soldiery,\r\nthanking them for their fidelity and good-will to him, and exhorting\r\nthem to afford his son Archelaus, whom he had appointed for their king,\r\nlike fidelity and good-will. After which Ptolemy, who had the king's\r\nseal intrusted to him, read the king's testament, which was to be of\r\nforce no otherwise than as it should stand when Cæsar had inspected it;\r\nso there was presently an acclamation made to Archelaus, as king; and\r\nthe soldiers came by bands, and their commanders with them, and promised\r\nthe same good-will to him, and readiness to serve him, which they had\r\nexhibited to Herod; and they prayed God to be assistant to him.\r\n\r\n3. After this was over, they prepared for his funeral, it being\r\nArchelaus's care that the procession to his father's sepulcher should be\r\nvery sumptuous. Accordingly, he brought out all his ornaments to adorn\r\nthe pomp of the funeral. The body was carried upon a golden bier,\r\nembroidered with very precious stones of great variety, and it was\r\ncovered over with purple, as well as the body itself; he had a diadem\r\nupon his head, and above it a crown of gold: he also had a scepter in\r\nhis right hand. About the bier were his sons and his numerous relations;\r\nnext to these was the soldiery, distinguished according to their several\r\ncountries and denominations; and they were put into the following order:\r\nFirst of all went his guards, then the band of Thracians, and after them\r\nthe Germans; and next the band of Galatians, every one in their\r\nhabiliments of war; and behind these marched the whole army in the same\r\nmanner as they used to go out to war, and as they used to be put in\r\narray by their muster-masters and centurions; these were followed by\r\nfive hundred of his domestics carrying spices. So they went eight\r\nfurlongs 12 to Herodium; for there by his own command he was to be\r\nburied. And thus did Herod end his life.\r\n\r\n4. Now Archelaus paid him so much respect, as to continue his mourning\r\ntill the seventh day; for so many days are appointed for it by the law\r\nof our fathers. And when he had given a treat to the multitude, and left\r\noff his motoring, he went up into the temple; he had also acclamations\r\nand praises given him, which way soever he went, every one striving with\r\nthe rest who should appear to use the loudest acclamations. So he\r\nascended a high elevation made for him, and took his seat, in a throne\r\nmade of gold, and spake kindly to the multitude, and declared with what\r\njoy he received their acclamations, and the marks of the good-will they\r\nshowed to him; and returned them thanks that they did not remember the\r\ninjuries his father had done them to his disadvantage; and promised them\r\nhe would endeavor not to be behindhand with them in rewarding their\r\nalacrity in his service, after a suitable manner; but that he should\r\nabstain at present from the name of king, and that he should have the\r\nhonor of that dignity, if Cæsar should confirm and settle that testament\r\nwhich his father had made; and that it was on this account, that when\r\nthe army would have put the diadem on him at Jericho, he would not\r\naccept of that honor, which is usually so much desired, because it was\r\nnot yet evident that he who was to be principally concerned in bestowing\r\nit would give it him; although, by his acceptance of the government, he\r\nshould not want the ability of rewarding their kindness to him and that\r\nit should be his endeavor, as to all things wherein they were concerned,\r\nto prove in every respect better than his father. Whereupon the\r\nmultitude, as it is usual with them, supposed that the first days of\r\nthose that enter upon such governments declare the intentions of those\r\nthat accept them; and so by how much Archelaus spake the more gently and\r\ncivilly to them, by so much did they more highly commend him, and made\r\napplication to him for the grant of what they desired. Some made a\r\nclamor that he would ease them of some of their annual payments; but\r\nothers desired him to release those that were put into prison by Herod,\r\nwho were many, and had been put there at several times; others of them\r\nrequired that he would take away those taxes which had been severely\r\nlaid upon what was publicly sold and bought. So Archelaus contradicted\r\nthem in nothing, since he pretended to do all things so as to get the\r\ngood-will of the multitude to him, as looking upon that good-will to be\r\na great step towards his preservation of the government. Hereupon he\r\nwent and offered sacrifice to God, and then betook himself to feast with\r\nhis friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. How The People Raised A Sedition Against Archelaus, And How\r\nHe Sailed To Rome.\r\n\r\n1. At this time also it was that some of the Jews got together out of a\r\ndesire of innovation. They lamented Matthias, and those that were slain\r\nwith him by Herod, who had not any respect paid them by a funeral\r\nmourning, out of the fear men were in of that man; they were those who\r\nhad been condemned for pulling down the golden eagle. The people made a\r\ngreat clamor and lamentation hereupon, and cast out some reproaches\r\nagainst the king also, as if that tended to alleviate the miseries of\r\nthe deceased. The people assembled together, and desired of Archelaus,\r\nthat, in way of revenge on their account, he would inflict punishment on\r\nthose who had been honored by Herod; and that, in the first and\r\nprincipal place, he would deprive that high priest whom Herod had made,\r\nand would choose one more agreeable to the law, and of greater purity,\r\nto officiate as high priest. This was granted by Archelaus, although he\r\nwas mightily offended at their importunity, because he proposed to\r\nhimself to go to Rome immediately to look after Cæsar's determination\r\nabout him. However, he sent the general of his forces to use\r\npersuasions, and to tell them that the death which was inflicted on\r\ntheir friends was according to the law; and to represent to them that\r\ntheir petitions about these things were carried to a great height of\r\ninjury to him; that the time was not now proper for such petitions, but\r\nrequired their unanimity until such time as he should be established in\r\nthe government by the consent of Cæsar, and should then be come back to\r\nthem; for that he would then consult with them in common concerning the\r\npurport of their petitions; but that they ought at present to be quiet,\r\nlest they should seem seditious persons.\r\n\r\n2. So when the king had suggested these things, and instructed his\r\ngeneral in what he was to say, he sent him away to the people; but they\r\nmade a clamor, and would not give him leave to speak, and put him in\r\ndanger of his life, and as many more as were desirous to venture upon\r\nsaying openly any thing which might reduce them to a sober mind, and\r\nprevent their going on in their present courses, because they had more\r\nconcern to have all their own wills performed than to yield obedience to\r\ntheir governors; thinking it to be a thing insufferable, that, while\r\nHerod was alive, they should lose those that were most dear to them, and\r\nthat when he was dead, they could not get the actors to be punished. So\r\nthey went on with their designs after a violent manner, and thought all\r\nto be lawful and right which tended to please them, and being unskillful\r\nin foreseeing what dangers they incurred; and when they had suspicion of\r\nsuch a thing, yet did the present pleasure they took in the punishment\r\nof those they deemed their enemies overweigh all such considerations;\r\nand although Archelaus sent many to speak to them, yet they treated them\r\nnot as messengers sent by him, but as persons that came of their own\r\naccord to mitigate their anger, and would not let one of them speak. The\r\nsedition also was made by such as were in a great passion; and it was\r\nevident that they were proceeding further in seditious practices, by the\r\nmultitude running so fast upon them.\r\n\r\n3. Now, upon the approach of that feast of unleavened bread, which the\r\nlaw of their fathers had appointed for the Jews at this time, which\r\nfeast is called the Passover 13 and is a memorial of their deliverance\r\nout of Egypt, when they offer sacrifices with great alacrity; and when\r\nthey are required to slay more sacrifices in number than at any other\r\nfestival; and when an innumerable multitude came thither out of the\r\ncountry, nay, from beyond its limits also, in order to worship God, the\r\nseditious lamented Judas and Matthias, those teachers of the laws, and\r\nkept together in the temple, and had plenty of food, because these\r\nseditious persons were not ashamed to beg it. And as Archelaus was\r\nafraid lest some terrible thing should spring up by means of these men's\r\nmadness, he sent a regiment of armed men, and with them a captain of a\r\nthousand, to suppress the violent efforts of the seditious before the\r\nwhole multitude should be infected with the like madness; and gave them\r\nthis charge, that if they found any much more openly seditious than\r\nothers, and more busy in tumultuous practices, they should bring them to\r\nhim. But those that were seditious on account of those teachers of the\r\nlaw, irritated the people by the noise and clamors they used to\r\nencourage the people in their designs; so they made an assault upon the\r\nsoldiers, and came up to them, and stoned the greatest part of them,\r\nalthough some of them ran away wounded, and their captain among them;\r\nand when they had thus done, they returned to the sacrifices which were\r\nalready in their hands. Now Archelaus thought there was no way to\r\npreserve the entire government but by cutting off those who made this\r\nattempt upon it; so he sent out the whole army upon them, and sent the\r\nhorsemen to prevent those that had their tents without the temple from\r\nassisting those that were within the temple, and to kill such as ran\r\naway from the footmen when they thought themselves out of danger; which\r\nhorsemen slew three thousand men, while the rest went to the neighboring\r\nmountains. Then did Archelaus order proclamation to be made to them all,\r\nthat they should retire to their own homes; so they went away, and left\r\nthe festival, out of fear of somewhat worse which would follow, although\r\nthey had been so bold by reason of their want of instruction. So\r\nArchelaus went down to the sea with his mother, and took with him\r\nNicolaus and Ptolemy, and many others of his friends, and left Philip\r\nhis brother as governor of all things belonging both to his own family\r\nand to the public. There went out also with him Salome, Herod's sister\r\nwho took with her, her children, and many of her kindred were with her;\r\nwhich kindred of hers went, as they pretended, to assist Archelaus in\r\ngaining the kingdom, but in reality to oppose him, and chiefly to make\r\nloud complaints of what he had done in the temple. But Sabinus, Cæsar's\r\nsteward for Syrian affairs, as he was making haste into Judea to\r\npreserve Herod's effects, met with Archelaus at Cæsarea; but Varus\r\n[president of Syria] came at that time, and restrained him from meddling\r\nwith them, for he was there as sent for by Archceaus, by the means of\r\nPtolemy. And Sabinus, out of regard to Varus, did neither seize upon any\r\nof the castles that were among the Jews, nor did he seal up the\r\ntreasures in them, but permitted Archelaus to have them, until Cæsar\r\nshould declare his resolution about them; so that, upon this his\r\npromise, he tarried still at Cæsarea. But after Archelaus was sailed for\r\nRome, and Varus was removed to Antioch, Sabinus went to Jerusalem, and\r\nseized on the king's palace. He also sent for the keepers of the\r\ngarrisons, and for all those that had the charge of Herod's effects, and\r\ndeclared publicly that he should require them to give an account of what\r\nthey had; and he disposed of the castles in the manner he pleased; but\r\nthose who kept them did not neglect what Archelaus had given them in\r\ncommand, but continued to keep all things in the manner that had been\r\nenjoined them; and their pretense was, that they kept them all for\r\nCæsar.\r\n\r\n4. At the same time also did Antipas, another of Herod's sons, sail to\r\nRome, in order to gain the government; being buoyed up by Salome with\r\npromises that he should take that government; and that he was a much\r\nhonester and fitter man than Archelaus for that authority, since Herod\r\nhad, in his former testament, deemed him the worthiest to be made king,\r\nwhich ought to be esteemed more valid than his latter testament. Antipas\r\nalso brought with him his mother, and Ptolemy the brother of Nicolaus,\r\none that had been Herod's most honored friend, and was now zealous for\r\nAntipas; but it was Ireneus the orator, and one who, on account of his\r\nreputation for sagacity, was intrusted with the affairs of the kingdom,\r\nwho most of all encouraged him to attempt to gain the kingdom; by whose\r\nmeans it was, that when some advised him to yield to Archelaus, as to\r\nhis elder brother, and who had been declared king by their father's last\r\nwill, he would not submit so to do. And when he was come to Rome, all\r\nhis relations revolted to him; not out of their good-will to him, but\r\nout of their hatred to Archelaus; though indeed they were most of all\r\ndesirous of gaining their liberty, and to be put under a Roman governor;\r\nbut if there were too great an opposition made to that, they thought\r\nAntipas preferable to Archelaus, and so joined with him, in order to\r\nprocure the kingdom for him. Sabinus also, by letters, accused Archelaus\r\nto Cæsar.\r\n\r\n5. Now when Archelaus had sent in his papers to Cæsar, wherein he\r\npleaded his right to the kingdom, and his father's testament, with the\r\naccounts of Herod's money, and with Ptolemy, who brought Herod's seal,\r\nhe so expected the event; but when Cæsar had read these papers, and\r\nVarus's and Sabinus's letters, with the accounts of the money, and what\r\nwere the annual incomes of the kingdom, and understood that Antipas had\r\nalso sent letters to lay claim to the kingdom, he summoned his friends\r\ntogether, to know their opinions, and with them Caius, the son of\r\nAgrippa, and of Julia his daughter, whom he had adopted, and took him,\r\nand made him sit first of all, and desired such as pleased to speak\r\ntheir minds about the affairs now before them. Now Antipater, Salome's\r\nson, a very subtle orator, and a bitter enemy to Archelaus, spake first\r\nto this purpose: That it was ridiculous in Archelaus to plead now to\r\nhave the kingdom given him, since he had, in reality, taken already the\r\npower over it to himself, before Cæsar had granted it to him; and\r\nappealed to those bold actions of his, in destroying so many at the\r\nJewish festival; and if the men had acted unjustly, it was but fit the\r\npunishing of them should have been reserved to those that were out of\r\nthe country, but had the power to punish them, and not been executed by\r\na man that, if he pretended to be a king, he did an injury to Cæsar, by\r\nusurping that authority before it was determined for him by Cæsar; but\r\nif he owned himself to be a private person, his case was much worse,\r\nsince he who was putting in for the kingdom could by no means expect to\r\nhave that power granted him, of which he had already deprived Cæsar [by\r\ntaking it to himself]. He also touched sharply upon him, and appealed to\r\nhis changing the commanders in the army, and his sitting in the royal\r\nthrone beforehand, and his determination of law-suits; all done as if he\r\nwere no other than a king. He appealed also to his concessions to those\r\nthat petitioned him on a public account, and indeed doing such things,\r\nthan which he could devise no greater if he had been already settled in\r\nthe kingdom by Cæsar. He also ascribed to him the releasing of the\r\nprisoners that were in the hippodrome, and many other things, that\r\neither had been certainly done by him, or were believed to be done, and\r\neasily might be believed to have been done, because they were of such a\r\nnature as to be usually done by young men, and by such as, out of a\r\ndesire of ruling, seize upon the government too soon. He also charged\r\nhim with his neglect of the funeral mourning for his father, and with\r\nhaving merry meetings the very night in which he died; and that it was\r\nthence the multitude took the handle of raising a tumult: and if\r\nArchelaus could thus requite his dead father, who had bestowed such\r\nbenefits upon him, and bequeathed such great things to him, by\r\npretending to shed tears for him in the day time, like an actor on the\r\nstage, but every night making mirth for having gotten the government, he\r\nwould appear to be the same Archelaus with regard to Cæsar, if he\r\ngranted him the kingdom, which he hath been to his father; since he had\r\nthen dancing and singing, as though an enemy of his were fallen, and not\r\nas though a man were carried to his funeral, that was so nearly related,\r\nand had been so great a benefactor to him. But he said that the greatest\r\ncrime of all was this, that he came now before Cæsar to obtain the\r\ngovernment by his grant, while he had before acted in all things as he\r\ncould have acted if Cæsar himself, who ruled all, had fixed him firmly\r\nin the government. And what he most aggravated in his pleading was the\r\nslaughter of those about the temple, and the impiety of it, as done at\r\nthe festival; and how they were slain like sacrifices themselves, some\r\nof whom were foreigners, and others of their own country, till the\r\ntemple was full of dead bodies: and all this was done, not by an alien,\r\nbut by one who pretended to the lawful title of a king, that he might\r\ncomplete the wicked tyranny which his nature prompted him to, and which\r\nis hated by all men. On which account his father never so much as\r\ndreamed of making him his successor in the kingdom, when he was of a\r\nsound mind, because he knew his disposition; and in his former and more\r\nauthentic testament, he appointed his antagonist Antipas to succeed; but\r\nthat Archelaus was called by his father to that dignity when he was in a\r\ndying condition, both of body and mind; while Antipas was called when he\r\nwas ripest in his judgment, and of such strength of body as made him\r\ncapable of managing his own affairs: and if his father had the like\r\nnotion of him formerly that he hath now showed, yet hath he given a\r\nsufficient specimen what a king he is likely to be, when he hath [in\r\neffect] deprived Cæsar of that power of disposing of the kingdom, which\r\nhe justly hath, and hath not abstained from making a terrible slaughter\r\nof his fellow citizens in the temple, while he was but a private person.\r\n\r\n6. So when Antipater had made this speech, and had confirmed what he had\r\nsaid by producing many witnesses from among Archelaus's own relations,\r\nhe made an end of his pleading. Upon which Nicolaus arose up to plead\r\nfor Archelaus, and said, \"That what had been done at the temple was\r\nrather to be attributed to the mind of those that had been killed, than\r\nto the authority of Archelaus; for that those who were the authors of\r\nsuch things are not only wicked in the injuries they do of themselves,\r\nbut in forcing sober persons to avenge themselves upon them. Now it is\r\nevident that what these did in way of opposition was done under\r\npretense, indeed, against Archelaus, but in reality against Cæsar\r\nhimself, for they, after an injurious manner, attacked and slew those\r\nwho were sent by Archelaus, and who came only to put a stop to their\r\ndoings. They had no regard, either to God or to the festival, whom\r\nAntipater yet is not ashamed to patronize, whether it be out of his\r\nindulgence of an enmity to Archelaus, or out of his hatred of virtue and\r\njustice. For as to those who begin such tumults, and first set about\r\nsuch unrighteous actions, they are the men who force those that punish\r\nthem to betake themselves to arms even against their will. So that\r\nAntipater in effect ascribes the rest of what was done to all those who\r\nwere of counsel to the accusers; for nothing which is here accused of\r\ninjustice has been done but what was derived from them as its authors;\r\nnor are those things evil in themselves, but so represented only in\r\norder to do harm to Archelaus. Such is these men's inclination to do an\r\ninjury to a man that is of their kindred, their father's benefactor, and\r\nfamiliarity acquainted with them, and that hath ever lived in friendship\r\nwith them; for that, as to this testament, it was made by the king when\r\nhe was of a sound mind, and so ought to be of more authority than his\r\nformer testament; and that for this reason, because Cæsar is therein\r\nleft to be the judge and disposer of all therein contained; and for\r\nCæsar, he will not, to be sure, at all imitate the unjust proceedings of\r\nthose men, who, during Herod's whole life, had on all occasions been\r\njoint partakers of power with him, and yet do zealously endeavor to\r\ninjure his determination, while they have not themselves had the same\r\nregard to their kinsman [which Archelaus had]. Cæsar will not therefore\r\ndisannul the testament of a man whom he had entirely supported, of his\r\nfriend and confederate, and that which is committed to him in trust to\r\nratify; nor will Cæsar's virtuous and upright disposition, which is\r\nknown and uncontested through all the habitable world, imitate the\r\nwickedness of these men in condemning a king as a madman, and as having\r\nlost his reason, while he hath bequeathed the succession to a good son\r\nof his, and to one who flies to Cæsar's upright determination for\r\nrefuge. Nor can Herod at any time have been mistaken in his judgment\r\nabout a successor, while he showed so much prudence as to submit all to\r\nCæsar's determination.\"\r\n\r\n7. Now when Nicolaus had laid these things before Cæsar, he ended his\r\nplea; whereupon Cæsar was so obliging to Archelaus, that he raised him\r\nup when he had cast himself down at his feet, and said that he well\r\ndeserved the kingdom; and he soon let them know that he was so far moved\r\nin his favor, that he would not act otherwise than his father's\r\ntestament directed, and than was for the advantage of Archelaus.\r\nHowever, while he gave this encouragement to Archelaus to depend on him\r\nsecurely, he made no full determination about him; and when the assembly\r\nwas broken up, he considered by himself whether he should confirm the\r\nkingdom to Archelaus, or whether he should part it among all Herod's\r\nposterity; and this because they all stood in need of much assistance to\r\nsupport them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. A Sedition Against Sabinus; And How Varus Brought The\r\nAuthors Of It To Punishment.\r\n\r\n1. But before these things could be brought to a settlement, Malthace,\r\nArchelaus's mother, fell into a distemper, and died of it; and letters\r\ncame from Varus, the president of Syria, which informed Cæsar of the\r\nrevolt of the Jews; for after Archelaus was sailed, the whole nation was\r\nin a tumult. So Varus, since he was there himself, brought the authors\r\nof the disturbance to punishment; and when he had restrained them for\r\nthe most part from this sedition, which was a great one, he took his\r\njourney to Antioch, leaving one legion of his army at Jerusalem to keep\r\nthe Jews quiet, who were now very fond of innovation. Yet did not this\r\nat all avail to put an end to that their sedition; for after Varus was\r\ngone away, Sabinus, Cæsar's procurator, staid behind, and greatly\r\ndistressed the Jews, relying on the forces that were left there that\r\nthey would by their multitude protect him; for he made use of them, and\r\narmed them as his guards, thereby so oppressing the Jews, and giving\r\nthem so great disturbance, that at length they rebelled; for he used\r\nforce in seizing the citadels, and zealously pressed on the search after\r\nthe king's money, in order to seize upon it by force, on account of his\r\nlove of gain and his extraordinary covetousness.\r\n\r\n2. But on the approach of pentecost, which is a festival of ours, so\r\ncalled from the days of our forefathers, a great many ten thousands of\r\nmen got together; nor did they come only to celebrate the festival, but\r\nout of their indignation at the madness of Sabinus, and at the injuries\r\nhe offered them. A great number there was of Galileans, and Idumeans,\r\nand many men from Jericho, and others who had passed over the river\r\nJordan, and inhabited those parts. This whole multitude joined\r\nthemselves to all the rest, and were more zealous than the others in\r\nmaking an assault on Sabinus, in order to be avenged on him; so they\r\nparted themselves into three bands, and encamped themselves in the\r\nplaces following:—some of them seized on the hippodrome and of the other\r\ntwo bands, one pitched themselves from the northern part of the temple\r\nto the southern, on the east quarter; but the third band held the\r\nwestern part of the city, where the king's palace was. Their work tended\r\nentirely to besiege the Romans, and to enclose them on all sides. Now\r\nSabinus was afraid of these men's number, and of their resolution, who\r\nhad little regard to their lives, but were very desirous not to be\r\novercome, while they thought it a point of puissance to overcome their\r\nenemies; so he sent immediately a letter to Varus, and, as he used to\r\ndo, was very pressing with him, and entreated him to come quickly to his\r\nassistance, because the forces he had left were in imminent danger, and\r\nwould probably, in no long time, be seized upon, and cut to pieces;\r\nwhile he did himself get up to the highest tower of the fortress\r\nPhasaelus, which had been built in honor of Phasaelus, king Herod's\r\nbrother, and called so when the Parthians had brought him to his death.\r\n14 So Sabinus gave thence a signal to the Romans to fall upon the Jews,\r\nalthough he did not himself venture so much as to come down to his\r\nfriends, and thought he might expect that the others should expose\r\nthemselves first to die on account of his avarice. However, the Romans\r\nventured to make a sally out of the place, and a terrible battle ensued;\r\nwherein, though it is true the Romans beat their adversaries, yet were\r\nnot the Jews daunted in their resolutions, even when they had the sight\r\nof that terrible slaughter that was made of them; but they went round\r\nabout, and got upon those cloisters which encompassed the outer court of\r\nthe temple, where a great fight was still continued, and they cast\r\nstones at the Romans, partly with their hands, and partly with slings,\r\nas being much used to those exercises. All the archers also in array did\r\nthe Romans a great deal of mischief, because they used their hands\r\ndexterously from a place superior to the others, and because the others\r\nwere at an utter loss what to do; for when they tried to shoot their\r\narrows against the Jews upwards, these arrows could not reach them,\r\ninsomuch that the Jews were easily too hard for their enemies. And this\r\nsort of fight lasted a great while, till at last the Romans, who were\r\ngreatly distressed by what was done, set fire to the cloisters so\r\nprivately, that those that were gotten upon them did not perceive it.\r\nThis fire 15 being fed by a great deal of combustible matter, caught\r\nhold immediately on the roof of the cloisters; so the wood, which was\r\nfull of pitch and wax, and whose gold was laid on it with wax, yielded\r\nto the flame presently, and those vast works, which were of the highest\r\nvalue and esteem, were destroyed utterly, while those that were on the\r\nroof unexpectedly perished at the same time; for as the roof tumbled\r\ndown, some of these men tumbled down with it, and others of them were\r\nkilled by their enemies who encompassed them. There was a great number\r\nmore, who, out of despair of saving their lives, and out of astonishment\r\nat the misery that surrounded them, did either cast themselves into the\r\nfire, or threw themselves upon their swords, and so got out of their\r\nmisery. But as to those that retired behind the same way by which they\r\nascended, and thereby escaped, they were all killed by the Romans, as\r\nbeing unarmed men, and their courage failing them; their wild fury being\r\nnow not able to help them, because they were destitute of armor,\r\ninsomuch that of those that went up to the top of the roof, not one\r\nescaped. The Romans also rushed through the fire, where it gave them\r\nroom so to do, and seized on that treasure where the sacred money was\r\nreposited; a great part of which was stolen by the soldiers, and Sabinus\r\ngot openly four hundred talents.\r\n\r\n3. But this calamity of the Jews' friends, who fell in this battle,\r\ngrieved them, as did also this plundering of the money dedicated to God\r\nin the temple. Accordingly, that body of them which continued best\r\ntogether, and was the most warlike, encompassed the palace, and\r\nthreatened to set fire to it, and kill all that were in it. Yet still\r\nthey commanded them to go out presently, and promised, that if they\r\nwould do so, they would not hurt them, nor Sabinus neither; at which\r\ntime the greatest part of the king's troops deserted to them, while\r\nRufus and Gratus, who had three thousand of the most warlike of Herod's\r\narmy with them, who were men of active bodies, went over to the Romans.\r\nThere was also a band of horsemen under the command of Rufus, which\r\nitself went over to the Romans also. However, the Jews went on with the\r\nsiege, and dug mines under the palace walls, and besought those that\r\nwere gone over to the other side not to be their hinderance, now they\r\nhad such a proper opportunity for the recovery of their country's\r\nancient liberty; and for Sabinus, truly he was desirous of going away\r\nwith his soldiers, but was not able to trust himself with the enemy, on\r\naccount of what mischief he had already done them; and he took this\r\ngreat [pretended] lenity of theirs for an argument why he should not\r\ncomply with them; and so, because he expected that Varus was coming, he\r\nstill bore the siege.\r\n\r\n4. Now at this time there were ten thousand other disorders in Judea,\r\nwhich were like tumults, because a great number put themselves into a\r\nwarlike posture, either out of hopes of gain to themselves, or out of\r\nenmity to the Jews. In particular, two thousand of Herod's old soldiers,\r\nwho had been already disbanded, got together in Judea itself, and fought\r\nagainst the king's troops, although Achiabus, Herod's first cousin,\r\nopposed them; but as he was driven out of the plains into the\r\nmountainous parts by the military skill of those men, he kept himself in\r\nthe fastnesses that were there, and saved what he could.\r\n\r\n5. There was also Judas, 16 the son of that Ezekias who had been head of\r\nthe robbers; which Ezekias was a very strong man, and had with great\r\ndifficulty been caught by Herod. This Judas, having gotten together a\r\nmultitude of men of a profligate character about Sepphoris in Galilee,\r\nmade an assault upon the palace [there,] and seized upon all the weapons\r\nthat were laid up in it, and with them armed every one of those that\r\nwere with him, and carried away what money was left there; and he became\r\nterrible to all men, by tearing and rending those that came near him;\r\nand all this in order to raise himself, and out of an ambitious desire\r\nof the royal dignity; and he hoped to obtain that as the reward not of\r\nhis virtuous skill in war, but of his extravagance in doing injuries.\r\n\r\n6. There was also Simon, who had been a slave of Herod the king, but in\r\nother respects a comely person, of a tall and robust body; he was one\r\nthat was much superior to others of his order, and had had great things\r\ncommitted to his care. This man was elevated at the disorderly state of\r\nthings, and was so bold as to put a diadem on his head, while a certain\r\nnumber of the people stood by him, and by them he was declared to be a\r\nking, and thought himself more worthy of that dignity than any one else.\r\nHe burnt down the royal palace at Jericho, and plundered what was left\r\nin it. He also set fire to many other of the king's houses in several\r\nplaces of the country, and utterly destroyed them, and permitted those\r\nthat were with him to take what was left in them for a prey; and he\r\nwould have done greater things, unless care had been taken to repress\r\nhim immediately; for Gratus, when he had joined himself to some Roman\r\nsoldiers, took the forces he had with him, and met Simon, and after a\r\ngreat and a long fight, no small part of those that came from Perea, who\r\nwere a disordered body of men, and fought rather in a bold than in a\r\nskillful manner, were destroyed; and although Simon had saved himself by\r\nflying away through a certain valley, yet Gratus overtook him, and cut\r\noff his head. The royal palace also at Amathus, by the river Jordan, was\r\nburnt down by a party of men that were got together, as were those\r\nbelonging to Simon. And thus did a great and wild fury spread itself\r\nover the nation, because they had no king to keep the multitude in good\r\norder, and because those foreigners who came to reduce the seditious to\r\nsobriety did, on the contrary, set them more in a flame, because of the\r\ninjuries they offered them, and the avaricious management of their\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\n7. But because Athronges, a person neither eminent by the dignity of his\r\nprogenitors, nor for any great wealth he was possessed of, but one that\r\nhad in all respects been a shepherd only, and was not known by any body;\r\nyet because he was a tall man, and excelled others in the strength of\r\nhis hands, he was so bold as to set up for king. This man thought it so\r\nsweet a thing to do more than ordinary injuries to others, that although\r\nhe should be killed, he did not much care if he lost his life in so\r\ngreat a design. He had also four brethren, who were tall men themselves,\r\nand were believed to be superior to others in the strength of their\r\nhands, and thereby were encouraged to aim at great things, and thought\r\nthat strength of theirs would support them in retaining the kingdom.\r\nEach of these ruled over a band of men of their own; for those that got\r\ntogether to them were very numerous. They were every one of them also\r\ncommanders; but when they came to fight, they were subordinate to him,\r\nand fought for him, while he put a diadem about his head, and assembled\r\na council to debate about what things should be done, and all things\r\nwere done according to his pleasure. And this man retained his power a\r\ngreat while; he was also called king, and had nothing to hinder him from\r\ndoing what he pleased. He also, as well as his brethren, slew a great\r\nmany both of the Romans and of the king's forces, and managed matters\r\nwith the like hatred to each of them. The king's forces they fell upon,\r\nbecause of the licentious conduct they had been allowed under Herod's\r\ngovernment; and they fell upon the Romans, because of the injuries they\r\nhad so lately received from them. But in process of time they grew more\r\ncruel to all sorts of men, nor could any one escape from one or other of\r\nthese seditions, since they slew some out of the hopes of gain, and\r\nothers from a mere custom of slaying men. They once attacked a company\r\nof Romans at Emmaus, who were bringing corn and weapons to the army, and\r\nfell upon Arius, the centurion, who commanded the company, and shot\r\nforty of the best of his foot soldiers; but the rest of them were\r\naffrighted at their slaughter, and left their dead behind them, but\r\nsaved themselves by the means of Gratus, who came with the king's troops\r\nthat were about him to their assistance. Now these four brethren\r\ncontinued the war a long while by such sort of expeditions, and much\r\ngrieved the Romans; but did their own nation also a great deal of\r\nmischief. Yet were they afterwards subdued; one of them in a fight with\r\nGratus, another with Ptolemy; Archelaus also took the eldest of them\r\nprisoner; while the last of them was so dejected at the other's\r\nmisfortune, and saw so plainly that he had no way now left to save\r\nhimself, his army being worn away with sickness and continual labors,\r\nthat he also delivered himself up to Archelaus, upon his promise and\r\noath to God [to preserve his life.] But these things came to pass a good\r\nwhile afterward.\r\n\r\n8. And now Judea was full of robberies; and as the several companies of\r\nthe seditious lighted upon any one to head them, he was created a king\r\nimmediately, in order to do mischief to the public. They were in some\r\nsmall measure indeed, and in small matters, hurtful to the Romans; but\r\nthe murders they committed upon their own people lasted a long while.\r\n\r\n9. As soon as Varus was once informed of the state of Judea by Sabinus's\r\nwriting to him, he was afraid for the legion he had left there; so he\r\ntook the two other legions, [for there were three legions in all\r\nbelonging to Syria,] and four troops of horsemen, with the several\r\nauxiliary forces which either the kings or certain of the tetrarchs\r\nafforded him, and made what haste he could to assist those that were\r\nthen besieged in Judea. He also gave order that all that were sent out\r\nfor this expedition, should make haste to Ptolemais. The citizens of\r\nBerytus also gave him fifteen hundred auxiliaries as he passed through\r\ntheir city. Aretas also, the king of Arabia Petrea, out of his hatred to\r\nHerod, and in order to purchase the favor of the Romans, sent him no\r\nsmall assistance, besides their footmen and horsemen; and when he had\r\nnow collected all his forces together, he committed part of them to his\r\nson, and to a friend of his, and sent them upon an expedition into\r\nGalilee, which lies in the neighborhood of Ptolemais; who made an attack\r\nupon the enemy, and put them to flight, and took Sepphoris, and made its\r\ninhabitants slaves, and burnt the city. But Varus himself pursued his\r\nmarch for Samaria with his whole army; yet did not he meddle with the\r\ncity of that name, because it had not at all joined with the seditious;\r\nbut pitched his camp at a certain village that belonged to Ptolemy,\r\nwhose name was Arus, which the Arabians burnt, out of their hatred to\r\nHerod, and out of the enmity they bore to his friends; whence they\r\nmarched to another village, whose name was Sampho, which the Arabians\r\nplundered and burnt, although it was a fortified and a strong place; and\r\nall along this march nothing escaped them, but all places were full of\r\nfire and of slaughter. Emmaus was also burnt by Varus's order, after its\r\ninhabitants had deserted it, that he might avenge those that had there\r\nbeen destroyed. From thence he now marched to Jerusalem; whereupon those\r\nJews whose camp lay there, and who had besieged the Roman legion, not\r\nbearing the coming of this army, left the siege imperfect: but as to the\r\nJerusalem Jews, when Varus reproached them bitterly for what had been\r\ndone, they cleared themselves of the accusation, and alleged that the\r\nconflux of the people was occasioned by the feast; that the war was not\r\nmade with their approbation, but by the rashness of the strangers, while\r\nthey were on the side of the Romans, and besieged together with them,\r\nrather than having any inclination to besiege them. There also came\r\nbeforehand to meet Varus, Joseph, the cousin-german of king Herod, as\r\nalso Gratus and Rufus, who brought their soldiers along with them,\r\ntogether with those Romans who had been besieged; but Sabinus did not\r\ncome into Varus's presence, but stole out of the city privately, and\r\nwent to the sea-side.\r\n\r\n10. Upon this, Varus sent a part of his army into the country, to seek\r\nout those that had been the authors of the revolt; and when they were\r\ndiscovered, he punished some of them that were most guilty, and some he\r\ndismissed: now the number of those that were crucified on this account\r\nwere two thousand. After which he disbanded his army, which he found no\r\nway useful to him in the affairs he came about; for they behaved\r\nthemselves very disorderly, and disobeyed his orders, and what Varus\r\ndesired them to do, and this out of regard to that gain which they made\r\nby the mischief they did. As for himself, when he was informed that ten\r\nthousand Jews had gotten together, he made haste to catch them; but they\r\ndid not proceed so far as to fight him, but, by the advice of Achiabus,\r\nthey came together, and delivered themselves up to him: hereupon Varus\r\nforgave the crime of revolting to the multitude, but sent their several\r\ncommanders to Cæsar, many of whom Cæsar dismissed; but for the several\r\nrelations of Herod who had been among these men in this war, they were\r\nthe only persons whom he punished, who, without the least regard to\r\njustice, fought against their own kindred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. An Embassage To Cæsar; And How Cæsar Confirmed Herod's\r\nTestament.\r\n\r\n1. So when Varus had settled these affairs, and had placed the former\r\nlegion at Jerusalem, he returned back to Antioch; but as for Archelaus,\r\nhe had new sources of trouble come upon him at Rome, on the occasions\r\nfollowing: for an embassage of the Jews was come to Rome, Varus having\r\npermitted the nation to send it, that they might petition for the\r\nliberty of living by their own laws. 17 Now the number of the\r\nambassadors that were sent by the authority of the nation were fifty, to\r\nwhich they joined above eight thousand of the Jews that were at Rome\r\nalready. Hereupon Cæsar assembled his friends, and the chief men among\r\nthe Romans, in the temple of Apollo, 18 which he had built at a vast\r\ncharge; whither the ambassadors came, and a multitude of the Jews that\r\nwere there already came with them, as did also Archelaus and his\r\nfriends; but as for the several kinsmen which Archelaus had, they would\r\nnot join themselves with him, out of their hatred to him; and yet they\r\nthought it too gross a thing for them to assist the ambassadors [against\r\nhim], as supposing it would be a disgrace to them in Cæsar's opinion to\r\nthink of thus acting in opposition to a man of their own kindred. Philip\r\n19 also was come hither out of Syria, by the persuasion of Varus, with\r\nthis principal intention to assist his brother [Archelaus]; for Varus\r\nwas his great friend: but still so, that if there should any change\r\nhappen in the form of government, [which Varus suspected there would,]\r\nand if any distribution should be made on account of the number that\r\ndesired the liberty of living by their own laws, that he might not be\r\ndisappointed, but might have his share in it.\r\n\r\n2. Now upon the liberty that was given to the Jewish ambassadors to\r\nspeak, they who hoped to obtain a dissolution of kingly government\r\nbetook themselves to accuse Herod of his iniquities; and they declared\r\nthat he was indeed in name a king, but that he had taken to himself that\r\nuncontrollable authority which tyrants exercise over their subjects, and\r\nhad made use of that authority for the destruction of the Jews, and did\r\nnot abstain from making many innovations among them besides, according\r\nto his own inclinations; and that whereas there were a great many who\r\nperished by that destruction he brought upon them, so many indeed as no\r\nother history relates, they that survived were far more miserable than\r\nthose that suffered under him; not only by the anxiety they were in from\r\nhis looks and disposition towards them, but from the danger their\r\nestates were in of being taken away by him. That he did never leave off\r\nadorning these cities that lay in their neighborhood, but were inhabited\r\nby foreigners; but so that the cities belonging to his own government\r\nwere ruined, and utterly destroyed that whereas, when he took the\r\nkingdom, it was in an extraordinary flourishing condition, he had filled\r\nthe nation with the utmost degree of poverty; and when, upon unjust\r\npretenses, he had slain any of the nobility, he took away their estates;\r\nand when he permitted any of them to live, he condemned them to the\r\nforfeiture of what they possessed. And besides the annual impositions\r\nwhich he laid upon every one of them, they were to make liberal presents\r\nto himself, to his domestics and friends, and to such of his slaves as\r\nwere vouchsafed the favor of being his tax-gatherers, because there was\r\nno way of obtaining a freedom from unjust violence without giving either\r\ngold or silver for it. That they would say nothing of the corruption of\r\nthe chastity of their virgins, and the reproach laid on their wives for\r\nincontinency, and those things acted after an insolent and inhuman\r\nmanner; because it was not a smaller pleasure to the sufferers to have\r\nsuch things concealed, than it would have been not to have suffered\r\nthem. That Herod had put such abuses upon them as a wild beast would not\r\nhave put on them, if he had power given him to rule over us; and that\r\nalthough their nation had passed through many subversions and\r\nalterations of government, their history gave no account of any calamity\r\nthey had ever been under, that could be compared with this which Herod\r\nhad brought upon their nation; that it was for this reason that they\r\nthought they might justly and gladly salute Archelaus as king, upon this\r\nsupposition, that whosoever should be set over their kingdom, he would\r\nappear more mild to them than Herod had been; and that they had joined\r\nwith him in the mourning for his father, in order to gratify him, and\r\nwere ready to oblige him in other points also, if they could meet with\r\nany degree of moderation from him; but that he seemed to be afraid lest\r\nhe should not be deemed Herod's own son; and so, without any delay, he\r\nimmediately let the nation understand his meaning, and this before his\r\ndominion was well established, since the power of disposing of it\r\nbelonged to Cæsar, who could either give it to him or not, as he\r\npleased. That he had given a specimen of his future virtue to his\r\nsubjects, and with what kind of moderation and good administration he\r\nwould govern them, by that his first action, which concerned them, his\r\nown citizens, and God himself also, when he made the slaughter of three\r\nthousand of his own countrymen at the temple. How then could they avoid\r\nthe just hatred of him, who, to the rest of his barbarity, hath added\r\nthis as one of our crimes, that we have opposed and contradicted him in\r\nthe exercise of his authority? Now the main thing they desired was this:\r\nThat they might be delivered from kingly and the like forms of\r\ngovernment, 20 and might be added to Syria, and be put under the\r\nauthority of such presidents of theirs as should be sent to them; for\r\nthat it would thereby be made evident, whether they be really a\r\nseditious people, and generally fond of innovations, or whether they\r\nwould live in an orderly manner, if they might have governors of any\r\nsort of moderation set over them.\r\n\r\n3. Now when the Jews had said this, Nicolaus vindicated the kings from\r\nthose accusations, and said, that as for Herod, since he had never been\r\nthus accused all the time of his life, it was not fit for those that\r\nmight have accused him of lesser crimes than those now mentioned, and\r\nmight have procured him to be punished during his lifetime, to bring an\r\naccusation against him now he is dead. He also attributed the actions of\r\nArchlaus to the Jews' injuries to him, who, affecting to govern contrary\r\nto the laws, and going about to kill those that would have hindered them\r\nfrom acting unjustly, when they were by him punished for what they had\r\ndone, made their complaints against him; so he accused them of their\r\nattempts for innovation, and of the pleasure they took in sedition, by\r\nreason of their not having learned to submit to justice and to the laws,\r\nbut still desiring to be superior in all things. This was the substance\r\nof what Nicolaus said.\r\n\r\n4. When Cæsar had heard these pleadings, he dissolved the assembly; but\r\na few days afterwards he appointed Archelaus, not indeed to be king of\r\nthe whole country, but ethnarch of the one half of that which had been\r\nsubject to Herod, and promised to give him the royal dignity hereafter,\r\nif he governed his part virtuously. But as for the other half, he\r\ndivided it into two parts, and gave it to two other of Herod's sons, to\r\nPhilip and to Antipas, that Antipas who disputed with Archelaus for the\r\nwhole kingdom. Now to him it was that Peres and Galilee paid their\r\ntribute, which amounted annually to two hundred talents, 21 while\r\nBatanea, with Trachonitis, as well as Auranitis, with a certain part of\r\nwhat was called the House of Zenodorus, 22 paid the tribute of one\r\nhundred talents to Philip; but Idumea, and Judea, and the country of\r\nSamaria paid tribute to Archelaus, but had now a fourth part of that\r\ntribute taken off by the order of Cæsar, who decreed them that\r\nmitigation, because they did not join in this revolt with the rest of\r\nthe multitude. There were also certain of the cities which paid tribute\r\nto Archelaus: Strato's Tower and Sebaste, with Joppa and Jerusalem; for\r\nas to Gaza, and Gadara, and Hippos, they were Grecian cities, which\r\nCæsar separated from his government, and added them to the province of\r\nSyria. Now the tribute-money that came to Archelaus every year from his\r\nown dominions amounted to six hundred talents.\r\n\r\n5. And so much came to Herod's sons from their father's inheritance. But\r\nSalome, besides what her brother left her by his testament, which were\r\nJamnia, and Ashdod, and Phasaelis, and five hundred thousand [drachmae]\r\nof coined silver, Cæsar made her a present of a royal habitation at\r\nAskelo; in all, her revenues amounted to sixty talents by the year, and\r\nher dwelling-house was within Archelaus's government. The rest also of\r\nthe king's relations received what his testament allotted them.\r\nMoreover, Cæsar made a present to each of Herod's two virgin daughters,\r\nbesides what their father left them, of two hundred and fifty thousand\r\n[drachmae] of silver, and married them to Pheroras's sons: he also\r\ngranted all that was bequeathed to himself to the king's sons, which was\r\none thousand five hundred talents, excepting a few of the vessels, which\r\nhe reserved for himself; and they were acceptable to him, not so much\r\nfor the great value they were of, as because they were memorials of the\r\nking to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. Concerning A Spurious Alexander.\r\n\r\n1. When these affairs had been thus settled by Cæsar, a certain young\r\nman, by birth a Jew, but brought up by a Roman freed-man in the city\r\nSidon, ingrafted himself into the kindred of Herod, by the resemblance\r\nof his countenance, which those that saw him attested to be that of\r\nAlexander, the son of Herod, whom he had slain; and this was an\r\nincitement to him to endeavor to obtain the government; so he took to\r\nhim as an assistant a man of his own country, [one that was well\r\nacquainted with the affairs of the palace, but, on other accounts, an\r\nill man, and one whose nature made him capable of causing great\r\ndisturbances to the public, and one that became a teacher of such a\r\nmischievous contrivance to the other,] and declared himself to be\r\nAlexander, and the son of Herod, but stolen away by one of those that\r\nwere sent to slay him, who, in reality, slew other men, in order to\r\ndeceive the spectators, but saved both him and his brother Aristobulus.\r\nThus was this man elated, and able to impose on those that came to him;\r\nand when he was come to Crete, he made all the Jews that came to\r\ndiscourse with him believe him [to be Alexander]. And when he had gotten\r\nmuch money which had been presented to him there, he passed over to\r\nMelos, where he got much more money than he had before, out of the\r\nbelief they had that he was of the royal family, and their hopes that he\r\nwould recover his father's principality, and reward his benefactors; so\r\nhe made haste to Rome, and was conducted thither by those strangers who\r\nentertained him. He was also so fortunate, as, upon his landing at\r\nDicearchia, to bring the Jews that were there into the same delusion;\r\nand not only other people, but also all those that had been great with\r\nHerod, or had a kindness for him, joined themselves to this man as to\r\ntheir king. The cause of it was this, that men were glad of his\r\npretenses, which were seconded by the likeness of his countenance, which\r\nmade those that had been acquainted with Alexander strongly to believe\r\nthat he was no other but the very same person, which they also confirmed\r\nto others by oath; insomuch that when the report went about him that he\r\nwas coming to Rome, the whole multitude of the Jews that were there went\r\nout to meet him, ascribing it to Divine Providence that he has so\r\nunexpectedly escaped, and being very joyful on account of his mother's\r\nfamily. And when he was come, he was carried in a royal litter through\r\nthe streets; and all the ornaments about him were such as kings are\r\nadorned withal; and this was at the expense of those that entertained\r\nhim. The multitude also flocked about him greatly, and made mighty\r\nacclamations to him, and nothing was omitted which could be thought\r\nsuitable to such as had been so unexpectedly preserved.\r\n\r\n2. When this thing was told Cæsar, he did not believe it, because Herod\r\nwas not easily to be imposed upon in such affairs as were of great\r\nconcern to him; yet, having some suspicion it might be so, he sent one\r\nCeladus, a freed-man of his, and one that had conversed with the young\r\nmen themselves, and bade him bring Alexander into his presence; so he\r\nbrought him, being no more accurate in judging about him than the rest\r\nof the multitude. Yet did not he deceive Cæsar; for although there was a\r\nresemblance between him and Alexander, yet was it not so exact as to\r\nimpose on such as were prudent in discerning; for this spurious\r\nAlexander had his hands rough, by the labors he had been put to and\r\ninstead of that softness of body which the other had, and this as\r\nderived from his delicate and generous education, this man, for the\r\ncontrary reason, had a rugged body. When, therefore, Cæsar saw how the\r\nmaster and the scholar agreed in this lying story, and in a bold way of\r\ntalking, he inquired about Aristobulus, and asked what became of him who\r\n[it seems] was stolen away together with him, and for what reason it was\r\nthat he did not come along with him, and endeavor to recover that\r\ndominion which was due to his high birth also. And when he said that he\r\nhad been left in the isle of Crete, for fear of the dangers of the sea,\r\nthat, in case any accident should come to himself, the posterity of\r\nMariamne might not utterly perish, but that Aristobulus might survive,\r\nand punish those that laid such treacherous designs against them; and\r\nwhen he persevered in his affirmations, and the author of the imposture\r\nagreed in supporting it, Cæsar took the young man by himself, and said\r\nto him, \"If thou wilt not impose upon me, thou shalt have this for thy\r\nreward, that thou shalt escape with thy life; tell me, then, who thou\r\nart, and who it was that had boldness enough to contrive such a cheat as\r\nthis. For this contrivance is too considerable a piece of villainy to be\r\nundertaken by one of thy age.\" Accordingly, because he had no other way\r\nto take, he told Cæsar the contrivance, and after what manner and by\r\nwhom it was laid together. So Cæsar, upon observing the spurious\r\nAlexander to be a strong active man, and fit to work with his hands,\r\nthat he might not break his promise to him, put him among those that\r\nwere to row among the mariners, but slew him that induced him to do what\r\nhe had done; for as for the people of Melos, he thought them\r\nsufficiently punished, in having thrown away so much of their money upon\r\nthis spurious Alexander. And such was the ignominious conclusion of this\r\nbold contrivance about the spurious Alexander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. How Archelaus Upon A Second Accusation, Was Banished To\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\n1. When Archelaus was entered on his ethnarchy, and was come into Judea,\r\nhe accused Joazar, the son of Boethus, of assisting the seditious, and\r\ntook away the high priesthood from him, and put Eleazar his brother in\r\nhis place. He also magnificently rebuilt the royal palace that had been\r\nat Jericho, and he diverted half the water with which the village of\r\nNeara used to be watered, and drew off that water into the plain, to\r\nwater those palm trees which he had there planted: he also built a\r\nvillage, and put his own name upon it, and called it Archelais.\r\nMoreover, he transgressed the law of our fathers 23 and married\r\nGlaphyra, the daughter of Archelaus, who had been the wife of his\r\nbrother Alexander, which Alexander had three children by her, while it\r\nwas a thing detestable among the Jews to marry the brother's wife. Nor\r\ndid this Eleazar abide long in the high priesthood, Jesus, the son of\r\nSie, being put in his room while he was still living.\r\n\r\n2. But in the tenth year of Archelaus's government, both his brethren,\r\nand the principal men of Judea and Samaria, not being able to bear his\r\nbarbarous and tyrannical usage of them, accused him before Cæsar, and\r\nthat especially because they knew he had broken the commands of Cæsar,\r\nwhich obliged him to behave himself with moderation among them.\r\nWhereupon Cæsar, when he heard it, was very angry, and called for\r\nArchelaus's steward, who took care of his affairs at Rome, and whose\r\nname was Archelaus also; and thinking it beneath him to write to\r\nArchelaus, he bid him sail away as soon as possible, and bring him to\r\nus: so the man made haste in his voyage, and when he came into Judea, he\r\nfound Archelaus feasting with his friends; so he told him what Cæsar had\r\nsent him about, and hastened him away. And when he was come [to Rome],\r\nCæsar, upon hearing what certain accusers of his had to say, and what\r\nreply he could make, both banished him, and appointed Vienna, a city of\r\nGaul, to be the place of his habitation, and took his money away from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n3. Now, before Archelaus was gone up to Rome upon this message, he\r\nrelated this dream to his friends: That he saw ears of corn, in number\r\nten, full of wheat, perfectly ripe, which ears, as it seemed to him,\r\nwere devoured by oxen. And when he was awake and gotten up, because the\r\nvision appeared to be of great importance to him, he sent for the\r\ndiviners, whose study was employed about dreams. And while some were of\r\none opinion, and some of another, [for all their interpretations did not\r\nagree,] Simon, a man of the sect of the Essens, desired leave to speak\r\nhis mind freely, and said that the vision denoted a change in the\r\naffairs of Archelaus, and that not for the better; that oxen, because\r\nthat animal takes uneasy pains in his labors, denoted afflictions, and\r\nindeed denoted, further, a change of affairs, because that land which is\r\nploughed by oxen cannot remain in its former state; and that the ears of\r\ncorn being ten, determined the like number of years, because an ear of\r\ncorn grows in one year; and that the time of Archelaus's government was\r\nover. And thus did this man expound the dream. Now on the fifth day\r\nafter this dream came first to Archelaus, the other Archelaus, that was\r\nsent to Judea by Cæsar to call him away, came hither also.\r\n\r\n4. The like accident befell Glaphyra his wife, who was the daughter of\r\nking Archelaus, who, as I said before, was married, while she was a\r\nvirgin, to Alexander, the son of Herod, and brother of Archelaus; but\r\nsince it fell out so that Alexander was slain by his father, she was\r\nmarried to Juba, the king of Lybia; and when he was dead, and she lived\r\nin widowhood in Cappadocia with her father, Archelaus divorced his\r\nformer wife Mariamne, and married her, so great was his affection for\r\nthis Glphyra; who, during her marriage to him, saw the following dream:\r\nShe thought she saw Alexander standing by her, at which she rejoiced,\r\nand embraced him with great affection; but that he complained o her, and\r\nsaid, O Glaphyra! thou provest that saying to be true, which assures us\r\nthat women are not to be trusted. Didst not thou pledge thy faith to me?\r\nand wast not thou married to me when thou wast a virgin? and had we not\r\nchildren between us? Yet hast thou forgotten the affection I bare to\r\nthee, out of a desire of a second husband. Nor hast thou been satisfied\r\nwith that injury thou didst me, but thou hast been so bold as to procure\r\nthee a third husband to lie by thee, and in an indecent and imprudent\r\nmanner hast entered into my house, and hast been married to Archelaus,\r\nthy husband and my brother. However, I will not forget thy former kind\r\naffection for me, but will set thee free from every such reproachful\r\naction, and cause thee to be mine again, as thou once wast. When she had\r\nrelated this to her female companions, in a few days' time she departed\r\nthis life.\r\n\r\n5. Now I did not think these histories improper for the present\r\ndiscourse, both because my discourse now is concerning kings, and\r\notherwise also on account of the advantage hence to be drawn, as well\r\nfor the confirmation of the immortality of the soul, as of the\r\nprovidence of God over human affairs, I thought them fit to be set down;\r\nbut if any one does not believe such relations, let him indeed enjoy his\r\nown opinion, but let him not hinder another that would thereby encourage\r\nhimself in virtue. So Archelaus's country was laid to the province of\r\nSyria; and Cyrenius, one that had been consul, was sent by Cæsar to take\r\naccount of people's effects in Syria, and to sell the house of\r\nArchelaus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Those who have a mind to know all the family and\r\ndescendants of Antipater the Idumean, and of Herod the Great, his son,\r\nand have a memory to preserve them all distinctly, may consult Josephus,\r\nAntiq.

Containing The Interval Of Thirty-Two Years.—From The\r\nBanishment Of Archelaus To The Departure From Babylon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. How Cyrenius Was Sent By Cæsar To Make A Taxation Of Syria\r\nAnd Judea; And How Coponius Was Sent To Be Procurator Of Judea;\r\nConcerning Judas Of Galilee And Concerning The Sects That Were Among The\r\nJews.\r\n\r\n1. Now Cyrenius, a Roman senator, and one who had gone through other\r\nmagistracies, and had passed through them till he had been consul, and\r\none who, on other accounts, was of great dignity, came at this time into\r\nSyria, with a few others, being sent by Cæsar to be a judge of that\r\nnation, and to take an account of their substance. Coponius also, a man\r\nof the equestrian order, was sent together with him, to have the supreme\r\npower over the Jews. Moreover, Cyrenius came himself into Judea, which\r\nwas now added to the province of Syria, to take an account of their\r\nsubstance, and to dispose of Archelaus's money; but the Jews, although\r\nat the beginning they took the report of a taxation heinously, yet did\r\nthey leave off any further opposition to it, by the persuasion of\r\nJoazar, who was the son of Beethus, and high priest; so they, being\r\nover-persuaded by Joazar's words, gave an account of their estates,\r\nwithout any dispute about it. Yet was there one Judas, a Gaulonite, 1 of\r\na city whose name was Gamala, who, taking with him Sadduc, 2 a Pharisee,\r\nbecame zealous to draw them to a revolt, who both said that this\r\ntaxation was no better than an introduction to slavery, and exhorted the\r\nnation to assert their liberty; as if they could procure them happiness\r\nand security for what they possessed, and an assured enjoyment of a\r\nstill greater good, which was that of the honor and glory they would\r\nthereby acquire for magnanimity. They also said that God would not\r\notherwise be assisting to them, than upon their joining with one another\r\nin such councils as might be successful, and for their own advantage;\r\nand this especially, if they would set about great exploits, and not\r\ngrow weary in executing the same; so men received what they said with\r\npleasure, and this bold attempt proceeded to a great height. All sorts\r\nof misfortunes also sprang from these men, and the nation was infected\r\nwith this doctrine to an incredible degree; one violent war came upon us\r\nafter another, and we lost our friends which used to alleviate our\r\npains; there were also very great robberies and murder of our principal\r\nmen. This was done in pretense indeed for the public welfare, but in\r\nreality for the hopes of gain to themselves; whence arose seditions, and\r\nfrom them murders of men, which sometimes fell on those of their own\r\npeople, [by the madness of these men towards one another, while their\r\ndesire was that none of the adverse party might be left,] and sometimes\r\non their enemies; a famine also coming upon us, reduced us to the last\r\ndegree of despair, as did also the taking and demolishing of cities;\r\nnay, the sedition at last increased so high, that the very temple of God\r\nwas burnt down by their enemies' fire. Such were the consequences of\r\nthis, that the customs of our fathers were altered, and such a change\r\nwas made, as added a mighty weight toward bringing all to destruction,\r\nwhich these men occasioned by their thus conspiring together; for Judas\r\nand Sadduc, who excited a fourth philosophic sect among us, and had a\r\ngreat many followers therein, filled our civil government with tumults\r\nat present, and laid the foundations of our future miseries, by this\r\nsystem of philosophy, which we were before unacquainted withal,\r\nconcerning which I will discourse a little, and this the rather because\r\nthe infection which spread thence among the younger sort, who were\r\nzealous for it, brought the public to destruction.\r\n\r\n2. The Jews had for a great while had three sects of philosophy peculiar\r\nto themselves; the sect of the Essens, and the sect of the Sadducees,\r\nand the third sort of opinions was that of those called Pharisees; of\r\nwhich sects, although I have already spoken in the second book of the\r\nJewish War, yet will I a little touch upon them now.\r\n\r\n3. Now, for the Pharisees, they live meanly, and despise delicacies in\r\ndiet; and they follow the conduct of reason; and what that prescribes to\r\nthem as good for them they do; and they think they ought earnestly to\r\nstrive to observe reason's dictates for practice. They also pay a\r\nrespect to such as are in years; nor are they so bold as to contradict\r\nthem in any thing which they have introduced; and when they determine\r\nthat all things are done by fate, they do not take away the freedom from\r\nmen of acting as they think fit; since their notion is, that it hath\r\npleased God to make a temperament, whereby what he wills is done, but so\r\nthat the will of man can act virtuously or viciously. They also believe\r\nthat souls have an immortal rigor in them, and that under the earth\r\nthere will be rewards or punishments, according as they have lived\r\nvirtuously or viciously in this life; and the latter are to be detained\r\nin an everlasting prison, but that the former shall have power to revive\r\nand live again; on account of which doctrines they are able greatly to\r\npersuade the body of the people; and whatsoever they do about Divine\r\nworship, prayers, and sacrifices, they perform them according to their\r\ndirection; insomuch that the cities give great attestations to them on\r\naccount of their entire virtuous conduct, both in the actions of their\r\nlives and their discourses also.\r\n\r\n4. But the doctrine of the Sadducees is this: That souls die with the\r\nbodies; nor do they regard the observation of any thing besides what the\r\nlaw enjoins them; for they think it an instance of virtue to dispute\r\nwith those teachers of philosophy whom they frequent: but this doctrine\r\nis received but by a few, yet by those still of the greatest dignity.\r\nBut they are able to do almost nothing of themselves; for when they\r\nbecome magistrates, as they are unwillingly and by force sometimes\r\nobliged to be, they addict themselves to the notions of the Pharisees,\r\nbecause the multitude would not otherwise bear them.\r\n\r\n5. The doctrine of the Essens is this: That all things are best ascribed\r\nto God. They teach the immortality of souls, and esteem that the rewards\r\nof righteousness are to be earnestly striven for; and when they send\r\nwhat they have dedicated to God into the temple, they do not offer\r\nsacrifices 3 because they have more pure lustrations of their own; on\r\nwhich account they are excluded from the common court of the temple, but\r\noffer their sacrifices themselves; yet is their course of life better\r\nthan that of other men; and they entirely addict themselves to\r\nhusbandry. It also deserves our admiration, how much they exceed all\r\nother men that addict themselves to virtue, and this in righteousness;\r\nand indeed to such a degree, that as it hath never appeared among any\r\nother men, neither Greeks nor barbarians, no, not for a little time, so\r\nhath it endured a long while among them. This is demonstrated by that\r\ninstitution of theirs, which will not suffer any thing to hinder them\r\nfrom having all things in common; so that a rich man enjoys no more of\r\nhis own wealth than he who hath nothing at all. There are about four\r\nthousand men that live in this way, and neither marry wives, nor are\r\ndesirous to keep servants; as thinking the latter tempts men to be\r\nunjust, and the former gives the handle to domestic quarrels; but as\r\nthey live by themselves, they minister one to another. They also appoint\r\ncertain stewards to receive the incomes of their revenues, and of the\r\nfruits of the ground; such as are good men and priests, who are to get\r\ntheir corn and their food ready for them. They none of them differ from\r\nothers of the Essens in their way of living, but do the most resemble\r\nthose Dacae who are called Polistae 4 [dwellers in cities].\r\n\r\n6. But of the fourth sect of Jewish philosophy, Judas the Galilean was\r\nthe author. These men agree in all other things with the Pharisaic\r\nnotions; but they have an inviolable attachment to liberty, and say that\r\nGod is to be their only Ruler and Lord. They also do not value dying any\r\nkinds of death, nor indeed do they heed the deaths of their relations\r\nand friends, nor can any such fear make them call any man lord. And\r\nsince this immovable resolution of theirs is well known to a great many,\r\nI shall speak no further about that matter; nor am I afraid that any\r\nthing I have said of them should be disbelieved, but rather fear, that\r\nwhat I have said is beneath the resolution they show when they undergo\r\npain. And it was in Gessius Florus's time that the nation began to grow\r\nmad with this distemper, who was our procurator, and who occasioned the\r\nJews to go wild with it by the abuse of his authority, and to make them\r\nrevolt from the Romans. And these are the sects of Jewish philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How Herod And Philip Built Several Cities In Honor Of Cæsar.\r\nConcerning The Succession Of Priests And Procurators; As Also What\r\nBefell Phraates And The Parthians.\r\n\r\n1. When Cyrenius had now disposed of Archelaus's money, and when the\r\ntaxings were come to a conclusion, which were made in the thirty-seventh\r\nyear of Cæsar's victory over Antony at Actium, he deprived Joazar of the\r\nhigh priesthood, which dignity had been conferred on him by the\r\nmultitude, and he appointed Ananus, the son of Seth, to be high priest;\r\nwhile Herod and Philip had each of them received their own tetrarchy,\r\nand settled the affairs thereof. Herod also built a wall about\r\nSepphoris, [which is the security of all Galilee,] and made it the\r\nmetropolis of the country. He also built a wall round Betharamphtha,\r\nwhich was itself a city also, and called it Julias, from the name of the\r\nemperor's wife. When Philip also had built Paneas, a city at the\r\nfountains of Jordan, he named it Cæsarea. He also advanced the village\r\nBethsaida, situate at the lake of Gennesareth, unto the dignity of a\r\ncity, both by the number of inhabitants it contained, and its other\r\ngrandeur, and called it by the name of Julias, the same name with\r\nCæsar's daughter.\r\n\r\n2. As Coponius, who we told you was sent along with Cyrenius, was\r\nexercising his office of procurator, and governing Judea, the following\r\naccidents happened. As the Jews were celebrating the feast of unleavened\r\nbread, which we call the Passover, it was customary for the priests to\r\nopen the temple-gates just after midnight. When, therefore, those gates\r\nwere first opened, some of the Samaritans came privately into Jerusalem,\r\nand threw about dead men's bodies, in the cloisters; on which account\r\nthe Jews afterward excluded them out of the temple, which they had not\r\nused to do at such festivals; and on other accounts also they watched\r\nthe temple more carefully than they had formerly done. A little after\r\nwhich accident Coponius returned to Rome, and Marcus Ambivius came to be\r\nhis successor in that government; under whom Salome, the sister of king\r\nHerod, died, and left to Julia, [Cæsar's wife,] Jamnia, all its\r\ntoparchy, and Phasaelis in the plain, and Arehelais, where is a great\r\nplantation of palm trees, and their fruit is excellent in its kind.\r\nAfter him came Annius Rufus, under whom died Cæsar, the second emperor\r\nof the Romans, the duration of whose reign was fifty-seven years,\r\nbesides six months and two days [of which time Antonius ruled together\r\nwith him fourteen years; but the duration of his life was seventy-seven\r\nyears]; upon whose death Tiberius Nero, his wife Julia's son, succeeded.\r\nHe was now the third emperor; and he sent Valerius Gratus to be\r\nprocurator of Judea, and to succeed Annius Rufus. This man deprived\r\nAnanus of the high priesthood, and appointed Ismael, the son of Phabi,\r\nto be high priest. He also deprived him in a little time, and ordained\r\nEleazar, the son of Ananus, who had been high priest before, to be high\r\npriest; which office, when he had held for a year, Gratus deprived him\r\nof it, and gave the high priesthood to Simon, the son of Camithus; and\r\nwhen he had possessed that dignity no longer than a year, Joseph\r\nCaiaphas was made his successor. When Gratus had done those things, he\r\nwent back to Rome, after he had tarried in Judea eleven years, when\r\nPontius Pilate came as his successor.\r\n\r\n3. And now Herod the tetrarch, who was in great favor with Tiberius,\r\nbuilt a city of the same name with him, and called it Tiberias. He built\r\nit in the best part of Galilee, at the lake of Gennesareth. There are\r\nwarm baths at a little distance from it, in a village named Emmaus.\r\nStrangers came and inhabited this city; a great number of the\r\ninhabitants were Galileans also; and many were necessitated by Herod to\r\ncome thither out of the country belonging to him, and were by force\r\ncompelled to be its inhabitants; some of them were persons of condition.\r\nHe also admitted poor people, such as those that were collected from all\r\nparts, to dwell in it. Nay, some of them were not quite free-men, and\r\nthese he was benefactor to, and made them free in great numbers; but\r\nobliged them not to forsake the city, by building them very good houses\r\nat his own expenses, and by giving them land also; for he was sensible,\r\nthat to make this place a habitation was to transgress the Jewish\r\nancient laws, because many sepulchers were to be here taken away, in\r\norder to make room for the city Tiberias 5 whereas our laws pronounce\r\nthat such inhabitants are unclean for seven days. 6\r\n\r\n4. About this time died Phraates, king of the Parthians, by the\r\ntreachery of Phraataces his son, upon the occasion following: When\r\nPhraates had had legitimate sons of his own, he had also an Italian\r\nmaid-servant, whose name was Thermusa, who had been formerly sent to him\r\nby Julius Cæsar, among other presents. He first made her his concubine;\r\nbut he being a great admirer of her beauty, in process of time having a\r\nson by her, whose name was Phraataces, he made her his legitimate wife,\r\nand had a great respect for her. Now she was able to persuade him to do\r\nany thing that she said, and was earnest in procuring the government of\r\nParthia for her son; but still she saw that her endeavors would not\r\nsucceed, unless she could contrive how to remove Phraates's legitimate\r\nsons [out of the kingdom;] so she persuaded him to send those his sons\r\nas pledges of his fidelity to Rome; and they were sent to Rome\r\naccordingly, because it was not easy for him to contradict her commands.\r\nNow while Phraataces was alone brought up in order to succeed in the\r\ngovernment, he thought it very tedious to expect that government by his\r\nfather's donation [as his successor]; he therefore formed a treacherous\r\ndesign against his father, by his mother's assistance, with whom, as the\r\nreport went, he had criminal conversation also. So he was hated for both\r\nthese vices, while his subjects esteemed this [wicked] love of his\r\nmother to be no way inferior to his parricide; and he was by them, in a\r\nsedition, expelled out of the country before he grew too great, and\r\ndied. But as the best sort of Parthians agreed together that it was\r\nimpossible they should be governed without a king, while also it was\r\ntheir constant practice to choose one of the family of Arsaces, [nor did\r\ntheir law allow of any others; and they thought this kingdom had been\r\nsufficiently injured already by the marriage with an Italian concubine,\r\nand by her issue,] they sent ambassadors, and called Orodes [to take the\r\ncrown]; for the multitude would not otherwise have borne them; and\r\nthough he was accused of very great cruelty, and was of an untractable\r\ntemper, and prone to wrath, yet still he was one of the family of\r\nArsaces. However, they made a conspiracy against him, and slew him, and\r\nthat, as some say, at a festival, and among their sacrifices; [for it is\r\nthe universal custom there to carry their swords with them;] but, as the\r\nmore general report is, they slew him when they had drawn him out a\r\nhunting. So they sent ambassadors to Rome, and desired they would send\r\none of those that were there as pledges to be their king. Accordingly,\r\nVonones was preferred before the rest, and sent to them [for he seemed\r\ncapable of such great fortune, which two of the greatest kingdoms under\r\nthe sun now offered him, his own and a foreign one]. However, the\r\nbarbarians soon changed their minds, they being naturally of a mutable\r\ndisposition, upon the supposal that this man was not worthy to be their\r\ngovernor; for they could not think of obeying the commands of one that\r\nhad been a slave, [for so they called those that had been hostages,] nor\r\ncould they bear the ignominy of that name; and this was the more\r\nintolerable, because then the Parthians must have such a king set over\r\nthem, not by right of war, but in time of peace. So they presently\r\ninvited Artabanus, king of Media, to be their king, he being also of the\r\nrace of Arsaces. Artabanus complied with the offer that was made him,\r\nand came to them with an army. So Vonones met him; and at first the\r\nmultitude of the Parthians stood on this side, and he put his army in\r\narray; but Artabanus was beaten, and fled to the mountains of Media. Yet\r\ndid he a little after gather a great army together, and fought with\r\nVonones, and beat him; whereupon Vonones fled away on horseback, with a\r\nfew of his attendants about him, to Seleucia [upon Tigris]. So when\r\nArtabanus had slain a great number, and this after he had gotten the\r\nvictory by reason of the very great dismay the barbarians were in, he\r\nretired to Ctesiphon with a great number of his people; and so he now\r\nreigned over the Parthians. But Vonones fled away to Armenia; and as\r\nsoon as he came thither, he had an inclination to have the government of\r\nthe country given him, and sent ambassadors to Rome [for that purpose].\r\nBut because Tiberius refused it him, and because he wanted courage, and\r\nbecause the Parthian king threatened him, and sent ambassadors to him to\r\ndenounce war against him if he proceeded, and because he had no way to\r\ntake to regain any other kingdom, [for the people of authority among the\r\nArmenians about Niphates joined themselves to Artabanus,] he delivered\r\nup himself to Silanus, the president of Syria, who, out of regard to his\r\neducation at Rome, kept him in Syria, while Artabanus gave Armenia to\r\nOrodes, one of his own sons.\r\n\r\n5. At this time died Antiochus, the king of Commagene; whereupon the\r\nmultitude contended with the nobility, and both sent ambassadors to\r\n[Rome]; for the men of power were desirous that their form of government\r\nmight be changed into that of a [Roman] province; as were the multitude\r\ndesirous to be under kings, as their fathers had been. So the senate\r\nmade a decree that Germanicus should be sent to settle the affairs of\r\nthe East, fortune hereby taking a proper opportunity for depriving him\r\nof his life; for when he had been in the East, and settled all affairs\r\nthere, his life was taken away by the poison which Piso gave him, as\r\nhath been related elsewhere. 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. Sedition Of The Jews Against Pontius Pilate. Concerning\r\nChrist, And What Befell Paulina And The Jews At Rome.\r\n\r\n1. But now Pilate, the procurator of Judea, removed the army from\r\nCæsarea to Jerusalem, to take their winter quarters there, in order to\r\nabolish the Jewish laws. So he introduced Cæsar's effigies, which were\r\nupon the ensigns, and brought them into the city; whereas our law\r\nforbids us the very making of images; on which account the former\r\nprocurators were wont to make their entry into the city with such\r\nensigns as had not those ornaments. Pilate was the first who brought\r\nthose images to Jerusalem, and set them up there; which was done without\r\nthe knowledge of the people, because it was done in the night time; but\r\nas soon as they knew it, they came in multitudes to Cæsarea, and\r\ninterceded with Pilate many days that he would remove the images; and\r\nwhen he would not grant their requests, because it would tend to the\r\ninjury of Cæsar, while yet they persevered in their request, on the\r\nsixth day he ordered his soldiers to have their weapons privately, while\r\nhe came and sat upon his judgment-seat, which seat was so prepared in\r\nthe open place of the city, that it concealed the army that lay ready to\r\noppress them; and when the Jews petitioned him again, he gave a signal\r\nto the soldiers to encompass them routed, and threatened that their\r\npunishment should be no less than immediate death, unless they would\r\nleave off disturbing him, and go their ways home. But they threw\r\nthemselves upon the ground, and laid their necks bare, and said they\r\nwould take their death very willingly, rather than the wisdom of their\r\nlaws should be transgressed; upon which Pilate was deeply affected with\r\ntheir firm resolution to keep their laws inviolable, and presently\r\ncommanded the images to be carried back from Jerusalem to Cæsarea.\r\n\r\n2. But Pilate undertook to bring a current of water to Jerusalem, and\r\ndid it with the sacred money, and derived the origin of the stream from\r\nthe distance of two hundred furlongs. However, the Jews 8 were not\r\npleased with what had been done about this water; and many ten thousands\r\nof the people got together, and made a clamor against him, and insisted\r\nthat he should leave off that design. Some of them also used reproaches,\r\nand abused the man, as crowds of such people usually do. So he habited a\r\ngreat number of his soldiers in their habit, who carried daggers under\r\ntheir garments, and sent them to a place where they might surround them.\r\nSo he bid the Jews himself go away; but they boldly casting reproaches\r\nupon him, he gave the soldiers that signal which had been beforehand\r\nagreed on; who laid upon them much greater blows than Pilate had\r\ncommanded them, and equally punished those that were tumultuous, and\r\nthose that were not; nor did they spare them in the least: and since the\r\npeople were unarmed, and were caught by men prepared for what they were\r\nabout, there were a great number of them slain by this means, and others\r\nof them ran away wounded. And thus an end was put to this sedition.\r\n\r\n3. Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to\r\ncall him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such\r\nmen as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of\r\nthe Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate,\r\nat the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to\r\nthe cross, 9 those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for\r\nhe appeared to them alive again the third day; 10 as the divine prophets\r\nhad foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning\r\nhim. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\n4. About the same time also another sad calamity put the Jews into\r\ndisorder, and certain shameful practices happened about the temple of\r\nIsis that was at Rome. I will now first take notice of the wicked\r\nattempt about the temple of Isis, and will then give an account of the\r\nJewish affairs. There was at Rome a woman whose name was Paulina; one\r\nwho, on account of the dignity of her ancestors, and by the regular\r\nconduct of a virtuous life, had a great reputation: she was also very\r\nrich; and although she was of a beautiful countenance, and in that\r\nflower of her age wherein women are the most gay, yet did she lead a\r\nlife of great modesty. She was married to Saturninus, one that was every\r\nway answerable to her in an excellent character. Decius Mundus fell in\r\nlove with this woman, who was a man very high in the equestrian order;\r\nand as she was of too great dignity to be caught by presents, and had\r\nalready rejected them, though they had been sent in great abundance, he\r\nwas still more inflamed with love to her, insomuch that he promised to\r\ngive her two hundred thousand Attic drachmae for one night's lodging;\r\nand when this would not prevail upon her, and he was not able to bear\r\nthis misfortune in his amours, he thought it the best way to famish\r\nhimself to death for want of food, on account of Paulina's sad refusal;\r\nand he determined with himself to die after such a manner, and he went\r\non with his purpose accordingly. Now Mundus had a freed-woman, who had\r\nbeen made free by his father, whose name was Ide, one skillful in all\r\nsorts of mischief. This woman was very much grieved at the young man's\r\nresolution to kill himself, [for he did not conceal his intentions to\r\ndestroy himself from others,] and came to him, and encouraged him by her\r\ndiscourse, and made him to hope, by some promises she gave him, that he\r\nmight obtain a night's lodging with Paulina; and when he joyfully\r\nhearkened to her entreaty, she said she wanted no more than fifty\r\nthousand drachmae for the entrapping of the woman. So when she had\r\nencouraged the young man, and gotten as much money as she required, she\r\ndid not take the same methods as had been taken before, because she\r\nperceived that the woman was by no means to be tempted by money; but as\r\nshe knew that she was very much given to the worship of the goddess\r\nIsis, she devised the following stratagem: She went to some of Isis's\r\npriests, and upon the strongest assurances [of concealment], she\r\npersuaded them by words, but chiefly by the offer of money, of twenty-\r\nfive thousand drachmae in hand, and as much more when the thing had\r\ntaken effect; and told them the passion of the young man, and persuaded\r\nthem to use all means possible to beguile the woman. So they were drawn\r\nin to promise so to do, by that large sum of gold they were to have.\r\nAccordingly, the oldest of them went immediately to Paulina; and upon\r\nhis admittance, he desired to speak with her by herself. When that was\r\ngranted him, he told her that he was sent by the god Anubis, who was\r\nfallen in love with her, and enjoined her to come to him. Upon this she\r\ntook the message very kindly, and valued herself greatly upon this\r\ncondescension of Anubis, and told her husband that she had a message\r\nsent her, and was to sup and lie with Anubis; so he agreed to her\r\nacceptance of the offer, as fully satisfied with the chastity of his\r\nwife. Accordingly, she went to the temple, and after she had supped\r\nthere, and it was the hour to go to sleep, the priest shut the doors of\r\nthe temple, when, in the holy part of it, the lights were also put out.\r\nThen did Mundus leap out, [for he was hidden therein,] and did not fail\r\nof enjoying her, who was at his service all the night long, as supposing\r\nhe was the god; and when he was gone away, which was before those\r\npriests who knew nothing of this stratagem were stirring, Paulina came\r\nearly to her husband, and told him how the god Anubis had appeared to\r\nher. Among her friends, also, she declared how great a value she put\r\nupon this favor, who partly disbelieved the thing, when they reflected\r\non its nature, and partly were amazed at it, as having no pretense for\r\nnot believing it, when they considered the modesty and the dignity of\r\nthe person. But now, on the third day after what had been done, Mundus\r\nmet Paulina, and said, \"Nay, Paulina, thou hast saved me two hundred\r\nthousand drachmae, which sum thou mightest have added to thy own family;\r\nyet hast thou not failed to be at my service in the manner I invited\r\nthee. As for the reproaches thou hast laid upon Mundus, I value not the\r\nbusiness of names; but I rejoice in the pleasure I reaped by what I did,\r\nwhile I took to myself the name of Anubis.\" When he had said this, he\r\nwent his way. But now she began to come to the sense of the grossness of\r\nwhat she had done, and rent her garments, and told her husband of the\r\nhorrid nature of this wicked contrivance, and prayed him not to neglect\r\nto assist her in this case. So he discovered the fact to the emperor;\r\nwhereupon Tiberius inquired into the matter thoroughly by examining the\r\npriests about it, and ordered them to be crucified, as well as Ide, who\r\nwas the occasion of their perdition, and who had contrived the whole\r\nmatter, which was so injurious to the woman. He also demolished the\r\ntemple of Isis, and gave order that her statue should be thrown into the\r\nriver Tiber; while he only banished Mundus, but did no more to him,\r\nbecause he supposed that what crime he had committed was done out of the\r\npassion of love. And these were the circumstances which concerned the\r\ntemple of Isis, and the injuries occasioned by her priests. I now return\r\nto the relation of what happened about this time to the Jews at Rome, as\r\nI formerly told you I would.\r\n\r\n5. There was a man who was a Jew, but had been driven away from his own\r\ncountry by an accusation laid against him for transgressing their laws,\r\nand by the fear he was under of punishment for the same; but in all\r\nrespects a wicked man. He, then living at Rome, professed to instruct\r\nmen in the wisdom of the laws of Moses. He procured also three other\r\nmen, entirely of the same character with himself, to be his partners.\r\nThese men persuaded Fulvia, a woman of great dignity, and one that had\r\nembraced the Jewish religion, to send purple and gold to the temple at\r\nJerusalem; and when they had gotten them, they employed them for their\r\nown uses, and spent the money themselves, on which account it was that\r\nthey at first required it of her. Whereupon Tiberius, who had been\r\ninformed of the thing by Saturninus, the husband of Fulvia, who desired\r\ninquiry might be made about it, ordered all the Jews to be banished out\r\nof Rome; at which time the consuls listed four thousand men out of them,\r\nand sent them to the island Sardinia; but punished a greater number of\r\nthem, who were unwilling to become soldiers, on account of keeping the\r\nlaws of their forefathers. 11 Thus were these Jews banished out of the\r\ncity by the wickedness of four men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How The Samaritans Made A Tumult And Pilate Destroyed Many Of\r\nThem; How Pilate Was Accused And What Things Were Done By Vitellius\r\nRelating To The Jews And The Parthians.\r\n\r\n1. But the nation of the Samaritans did not escape without tumults. The\r\nman who excited them to it was one who thought lying a thing of little\r\nconsequence, and who contrived every thing so that the multitude might\r\nbe pleased; so he bid them to get together upon Mount Gerizzim, which is\r\nby them looked upon as the most holy of all mountains, and assured them,\r\nthat when they were come thither, he would show them those sacred\r\nvessels which were laid under that place, because Moses put them there\r\n12 So they came thither armed, and thought the discourse of the man\r\nprobable; and as they abode at a certain village, which was called\r\nTirathaba, they got the rest together to them, and desired to go up the\r\nmountain in a great multitude together; but Pilate prevented their going\r\nup, by seizing upon the roads with a great band of horsemen and foot-\r\nmen, who fell upon those that were gotten together in the village; and\r\nwhen it came to an action, some of them they slew, and others of them\r\nthey put to flight, and took a great many alive, the principal of which,\r\nand also the most potent of those that fled away, Pilate ordered to be\r\nslain.\r\n\r\n2. But when this tumult was appeased, the Samaritan senate sent an\r\nembassy to Vitellius, a man that had been consul, and who was now\r\npresident of Syria, and accused Pilate of the murder of those that were\r\nkilled; for that they did not go to Tirathaba in order to revolt from\r\nthe Romans, but to escape the violence of Pilate. So Vitellius sent\r\nMarcellus, a friend of his, to take care of the affairs of Judea, and\r\nordered Pilate to go to Rome, to answer before the emperor to the\r\naccusations of the Jews. So Pilate, when he had tarried ten years in\r\nJudea, made haste to Rome, and this in obedience to the orders of\r\nVitellius, which he durst not contradict; but before he could get to\r\nRome Tiberius was dead.\r\n\r\n3. But Vitellius came into Judea, and went up to Jerusalem; it was at\r\nthe time of that festival which is called the Passover. Vitellius was\r\nthere magnificently received, and released the inhabitants of Jerusalem\r\nfrom all the taxes upon the fruits that were bought and sold, and gave\r\nthem leave to have the care of the high priest's vestments, with all\r\ntheir ornaments, and to have them under the custody of the priests in\r\nthe temple, which power they used to have formerly, although at this\r\ntime they were laid up in the tower of Antonia, the citadel so called,\r\nand that on the occasion following: There was one of the [high] priests,\r\nnamed Hyrcanus; and as there were many of that name, he was the first of\r\nthem; this man built a tower near the temple, and when he had so done,\r\nhe generally dwelt in it, and had these vestments with him, because it\r\nwas lawful for him alone to put them on, and he had them there reposited\r\nwhen he went down into the city, and took his ordinary garments; the\r\nsame things were continued to be done by his sons, and by their sons\r\nafter them. But when Herod came to be king, he rebuilt this tower, which\r\nwas very conveniently situated, in a magnificent manner; and because he\r\nwas a friend to Antonius, he called it by the name of Antonia. And as he\r\nfound these vestments lying there, he retained them in the same place,\r\nas believing, that while he had them in his custody, the people would\r\nmake no innovations against him. The like to what Herod did was done by\r\nhis son Archelaus, who was made king after him; after whom the Romans,\r\nwhen they entered on the government, took possession of these vestments\r\nof the high priest, and had them reposited in a stone-chamber, under the\r\nseal of the priests, and of the keepers of the temple, the captain of\r\nthe guard lighting a lamp there every day; and seven days before a\r\nfestival 13 they were delivered to them by the captain of the guard,\r\nwhen the high priest having purified them, and made use of them, laid\r\nthem up again in the same chamber where they had been laid up before,\r\nand this the very next day after the feast was over. This was the\r\npractice at the three yearly festivals, and on the fast day; but\r\nVitellius put those garments into our own power, as in the days of our\r\nforefathers, and ordered the captain of the guard not to trouble himself\r\nto inquire where they were laid, or when they were to be used; and this\r\nhe did as an act of kindness, to oblige the nation to him. Besides\r\nwhich, he also deprived Joseph, who was also called Caiaphas, of the\r\nhigh priesthood, and appointed Jonathan the son of Ananus, the former\r\nhigh priest, to succeed him. After which, he took his journey back to\r\nAntioch.\r\n\r\n4. Moreover, Tiberius sent a letter to Vitellius, and commanded him to\r\nmake a league of friendship with Artabanus, the king of Parthia; for\r\nwhile he was his enemy, he terrified him, because he had taken Armenia\r\naway from him, lest he should proceed further, and told him he should no\r\notherwise trust him than upon his giving him hostages, and especially\r\nhis son Artabanus. Upon Tiberius's writing thus to Vitellius, by the\r\noffer of great presents of money, he persuaded both the king of Iberia\r\nand the king of Albania to make no delay, but to fight against\r\nArtabanus; and although they would not do it themselves, yet did they\r\ngive the Scythians a passage through their country, and opened the\r\nCaspian gates to them, and brought them upon Artabanus. So Armenia was\r\nagain taken from the Parthians, and the country of Parthia was filled\r\nwith war, and the principal of their men were slain, and all things were\r\nin disorder among them: the king's son also himself fell in these wars,\r\ntogether with many ten thousands of his army. Vitellius had also sent\r\nsuch great sums of money to Artabanus's father's kinsmen and friends,\r\nthat he had almost procured him to be slain by the means of those bribes\r\nwhich they had taken. And when Artabanus perceived that the plot laid\r\nagainst him was not to be avoided, because it was laid by the principal\r\nmen, and those a great many in number, and that it would certainly take\r\neffect,—when he had estimated the number of those that were truly\r\nfaithful to him, as also of those who were already corrupted, but were\r\ndeceitful in the kindness they professed to him, and were likely, upon\r\ntrial, to go over to his enemies, he made his escape to the upper\r\nprovinces, where he afterwards raised a great army out of the Dahae and\r\nSacre, and fought with his enemies, and retained his principality.\r\n\r\n5. When Tiberius had heard of these things, he desired to have a league\r\nof friendship made between him and Artabanus; and when, upon this\r\ninvitation, he received the proposal kindly, Artabanus and Vitellius\r\nwent to Euphrates, and as a bridge was laid over the river, they each of\r\nthem came with their guards about them, and met one another on the midst\r\nof the bridge. And when they had agreed upon the terms of peace Herod,\r\nthe tetrarch erected a rich tent on the midst of the passage, and made\r\nthem a feast there. Artabanus also, not long afterward, sent his son\r\nDarius as an hostage, with many presents, among which there was a man\r\nseven cubits tall, a Jew he was by birth, and his name was Eleazar, who,\r\nfor his tallness, was called a giant. After which Vitellius went to\r\nAntioch, and Artabanus to Babylon; but Herod [the tetrarch] being\r\ndesirous to give Cæsar the first information that they had obtained\r\nhostages, sent posts with letters, wherein he had accurately described\r\nall the particulars, and had left nothing for the consular Vitellius to\r\ninform him of. But when Vitellius's letters were sent, and Cæsar had let\r\nhim know that he was acquainted with the affairs already, because Herod\r\nhad given him an account of them before, Vitellius was very much\r\ntroubled at it; and supposing that he had been thereby a greater\r\nsufferer than he really was, he kept up a secret anger upon this\r\noccasion, till he could be revenged on him, which he was after Caius had\r\ntaken the government.\r\n\r\n6. About this time it was that Philip, Herod's brother, departed this\r\nlife, in the twentieth year of the reign of Tiberius, 14 after he had\r\nbeen tetrarch of Trachonitis and Gaulanitis, and of the nation of the\r\nBataneans also, thirty-seven years. He had showed himself a person of\r\nmoderation and quietness in the conduct of his life and government; he\r\nconstantly lived in that country which was subject to him; he used to\r\nmake his progress with a few chosen friends; his tribunal also, on which\r\nhe sat in judgment, followed him in his progress; and when any one met\r\nhim who wanted his assistance, he made no delay, but had his tribunal\r\nset down immediately, wheresoever he happened to be, and sat down upon\r\nit, and heard his complaint: he there ordered the guilty that were\r\nconvicted to be punished, and absolved those that had been accused\r\nunjustly. He died at Julias; and when he was carried to that monument\r\nwhich he had already erected for himself beforehand, he was buried with\r\ngreat pomp. His principality Tiberius took, [for he left no sons behind\r\nhim,] and added it to the province of Syria, but gave order that the\r\ntributes which arose from it should be collected, and laid up in his\r\ntetrachy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. Herod The Tetrarch Makes War With Aretas, The King Of Arabia,\r\nAnd Is Beaten By Him As Also Concerning The Death Of John The Baptist.\r\nHow Vitellius Went Up To Jerusalem; Together With Some Account Of\r\nAgrippa And Of The Posterity Of Herod The Great.\r\n\r\n1. About this time Aretas [the king of Arabia Petres] and Herod had a\r\nquarrel on the account following: Herod the tetrarch had, married the\r\ndaughter of Aretas, and had lived with her a great while; but when he\r\nwas once at Rome, he lodged with Herod, 15 who was his brother indeed,\r\nbut not by the same mother; for this Herod was the son of the high\r\npriest Sireoh's daughter. However, he fell in love with Herodias, this\r\nlast Herod's wife, who was the daughter of Aristobulus their brother,\r\nand the sister of Agrippa the Great. This man ventured to talk to her\r\nabout a marriage between them; which address, when she admitted, an\r\nagreement was made for her to change her habitation, and come to him as\r\nsoon as he should return from Rome: one article of this marriage also\r\nwas this, that he should divorce Aretas's daughter. So Antipas, when he\r\nhad made this agreement, sailed to Rome; but when he had done there the\r\nbusiness he went about, and was returned again, his wife having\r\ndiscovered the agreement he had made with Herodias, and having learned\r\nit before he had notice of her knowledge of the whole design, she\r\ndesired him to send her to Macherus, which is a place in the borders of\r\nthe dominions of Aretas and Herod, without informing him of any of her\r\nintentions. Accordingly Herod sent her thither, as thinking his wife had\r\nnot perceived any thing; now she had sent a good while before to\r\nMacherus, which was subject to her father and so all things necessary\r\nfor her journey were made ready for her by the general of Aretas's army;\r\nand by that means she soon came into Arabia, under the conduct of the\r\nseveral generals, who carried her from one to another successively; and\r\nshe soon came to her father, and told him of Herod's intentions. So\r\nAretas made this the first occasion of his enmity between him and Herod,\r\nwho had also some quarrel with him about their limits at the country of\r\nGamalitis. So they raised armies on both sides, and prepared for war,\r\nand sent their generals to fight instead of themselves; and when they\r\nhad joined battle, all Herod's army was destroyed by the treachery of\r\nsome fugitives, who, though they were of the tetrarchy of Philip, joined\r\nwith Aretas's army.. So Herod wrote about these affairs to Tiberius, who\r\nbeing very angry at the attempt made by Aretas, wrote to Vitellius to\r\nmake war upon him, and either to take him alive, and bring him to him in\r\nbonds, or to kill him, and send him his head. This was the charge that\r\nTiberius gave to the president of Syria.\r\n\r\n2. Now some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army\r\ncame from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did\r\nagainst John, that was called the Baptist: for Herod slew him, who was a\r\ngood man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue, both as to\r\nrighteousness towards one another, and piety towards God, and so to come\r\nto baptism; for that the washing [with water] would be acceptable to\r\nhim, if they made use of it, not in order to the putting away [or the\r\nremission] of some sins [only], but for the purification of the body;\r\nsupposing still that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by\r\nrighteousness. Now when [many] others came in crowds about him, for they\r\nwere very greatly moved [or pleased] by hearing his words, Herod, who\r\nfeared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it\r\ninto his power and inclination to raise a rebellion, [for they seemed\r\nready to do any thing he should advise,] thought it best, by putting him\r\nto death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself\r\ninto difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when\r\nit would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of Herod's\r\nsuspicious temper, to Macherus, the castle I before mentioned, and was\r\nthere put to death. Now the Jews had an opinion that the destruction of\r\nthis army was sent as a punishment upon Herod, and a mark of God's\r\ndispleasure to him.\r\n\r\n3. So Vitellius prepared to make war with Aretas, having with him two\r\nlegions of armed men; he also took with him all those of light armature,\r\nand of the horsemen which belonged to them, and were drawn out of those\r\nkingdoms which were under the Romans, and made haste for Petra, and came\r\nto Ptolemais. But as he was marching very busily, and leading his army\r\nthrough Judea, the principal men met him, and desired that he would not\r\nthus march through their land; for that the laws of their country would\r\nnot permit them to overlook those images which were brought into it, of\r\nwhich there were a great many in their ensigns; so he was persuaded by\r\nwhat they said, and changed that resolution of his which he had before\r\ntaken in this matter. Whereupon he ordered the army to march along the\r\ngreat plain, while he himself, with Herod the tetrarch and his friends,\r\nwent up to Jerusalem to offer sacrifice to God, an ancient festival of\r\nthe Jews being then just approaching; and when he had been there, and\r\nbeen honorably entertained by the multitude of the Jews, he made a stay\r\nthere for three days, within which time he deprived Jonathan of the high\r\npriesthood, and gave it to his brother Theophilus. But when on the\r\nfourth day letters came to him, which informed him of the death of\r\nTiberius, he obliged the multitude to take an oath of fidelity to Caius;\r\nhe also recalled his army, and made them every one go home, and take\r\ntheir winter quarters there, since, upon the devolution of the empire\r\nupon Caius, he had not the like authority of making this war which he\r\nhad before. It was also reported, that when Aretas heard of the coming\r\nof Vitellius to fight him, he said, upon his consulting the diviners,\r\nthat it was impossible that this army of Vitellius's could enter Petra;\r\nfor that one of the rulers would die, either he that gave orders for the\r\nwar, or he that was marching at the other's desire, in order to be\r\nsubservient to his will, or else he against whom this army is prepared.\r\nSo Vitellius truly retired to Antioch; but Agrippa, the son of\r\nAristobulus, went up to Rome, a year before the death of Tiberius, in\r\norder to treat of some affairs with the emperor, if he might be\r\npermitted so to do. I have now a mind to describe Herod and his family,\r\nhow it fared with them, partly because it is suitable to this history to\r\nspeak of that matter, and partly because this thing is a demonstration\r\nof the interposition of Providence, how a multitude of children is of no\r\nadvantage, no more than any other strength that mankind set their hearts\r\nupon, besides those acts of piety which are done towards God; for it\r\nhappened, that, within the revolution of a hundred years, the posterity\r\nof Herod, which were a great many in number, were, excepting a few,\r\nutterly destroyed. 16 One may well apply this for the instruction of\r\nmankind, and learn thence how unhappy they were: it will also show us\r\nthe history of Agrippa, who, as he was a person most worthy of\r\nadmiration, so was he from a private man, beyond all the expectation of\r\nthose that knew him, advanced to great power and authority. I have said\r\nsomething of them formerly, but I shall now also speak accurately about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n4. Herod the Great had two daughters by Mariamne, the [grand] daughter\r\nof Hyrcanus; the one was Salampsio, who was married to Phasaelus, her\r\nfirst cousin, who was himself the son of Phasaelus, Herod's brother, her\r\nfather making the match; the other was Cypros, who was herself married\r\nalso to her first cousin Antipater, the son of Salome, Herod's sister.\r\nPhasaelus had five children by Salampsio; Antipater, Herod, and\r\nAlexander, and two daughters, Alexandra and Cypros; which last Agrippa,\r\nthe son of Aristobulus, married; and Timius of Cyprus married Alexandra;\r\nhe was a man of note, but had by her no children. Agrippa had by Cypros\r\ntwo sons and three daughters, which daughters were named Bernice,\r\nMariamne, and Drusius; but the names of the sons were Agrippa and\r\nDrusus, of which Drusus died before he came to the years of puberty; but\r\ntheir father, Agrippa, was brought up with his other brethren, Herod and\r\nAristobulus, for these were also the sons of the son of Herod the Great\r\nby Bernice; but Bernice was the daughter of Costobarus and of Salome,\r\nwho was Herod's sister. Aristobulus left these infants when he was slain\r\nby his father, together with his brother Alexander, as we have already\r\nrelated. But when they were arrived at years of puberty, this Herod, the\r\nbrother of Agrippa, married Mariamne, the daughter of Olympias, who was\r\nthe daughter of Herod the king, and of Joseph, the son of Joseph, who\r\nwas brother to Herod the king, and had by her a son, Aristobulus; but\r\nAristobulus, the third brother of Agrippa, married Jotape, the daughter\r\nof Sampsigeramus, king of Emesa; they had a daughter who was deaf, whose\r\nname also was Jotape; and these hitherto were the children of the male\r\nline. But Herodias, their sister, was married to Herod [Philip], the son\r\nof Herod the Great, who was born of Mariamne, the daughter of Simon the\r\nhigh priest, who had a daughter, Salome; after whose birth Herodias took\r\nupon her to confound the laws of our country, and divorced herself from\r\nher husband while he was alive, and was married to Herod [Antipas], her\r\nhusband's brother by the father's side, he was tetrarch of Galilee; but\r\nher daughter Salome was married to Philip, the son of Herod, and\r\ntetrarch of Trachonitis; and as he died childless, Aristobulus, the son\r\nof Herod, the brother of Agrippa, married her; they had three sons,\r\nHerod, Agrippa, and Aristobulus; and this was the posterity of Phasaelus\r\nand Salampsio. But the daughter of Antipater by Cypros was Cypros, whom\r\nAlexas Selcias, the son of Alexas, married; they had a daughter, Cypros;\r\nbut Herod and Alexander, who, as we told you, were the brothers of\r\nAntipater, died childless. As to Alexander, the son of Herod the king,\r\nwho was slain by his father, he had two sons, Alexander and Tigranes, by\r\nthe daughter of Archelaus, king of Cappadocia. Tigranes, who was king of\r\nArmenia, was accused at Rome, and died childless; Alexander had a son of\r\nthe same name with his brother Tigranes, and was sent to take possession\r\nof the kingdom of Armenia by Nero; he had a son, Alexander, who married\r\nJotape, 17 the daughter of Antiochus, the king of Commagena; Vespasian\r\nmade him king of an island in Cilicia. But these descendants of\r\nAlexander, soon after their birth, deserted the Jewish religion, and\r\nwent over to that of the Greeks. But for the rest of the daughters of\r\nHerod the king, it happened that they died childless. And as these\r\ndescendants of Herod, whom we have enumerated, were in being at the same\r\ntime that Agrippa the Great took the kingdom, and I have now given an\r\naccount of them, it now remains that I relate the several hard fortunes\r\nwhich befell Agrippa, and how he got clear of them, and was advanced to\r\nthe greatest height of dignity and power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. Of The Navigation Of King Agrippa To Rome, To Tiberius Cæsar;\r\nAnd Now Upon His Being Accused By His Own Freed-Man, He Was Bound; How\r\nAlso He, Was Set At Liberty By Caius, After Tiberius's Death And Was\r\nMade King Of The Tetrarchy Of Philip.\r\n\r\n1. A Little before the death of Herod the king, Agrippa lived at Rome,\r\nand was generally brought up and conversed with Drusus, the emperor\r\nTiberius's son, and contracted a friendship with Antonia, the wife of\r\nDrusus the Great, who had his mother Bernice in great esteem, and was\r\nvery desirous of advancing her son. Now as Agrippa was by nature\r\nmagnanimous and generous in the presents he made, while his mother was\r\nalive, this inclination of his mind did not appear, that he might be\r\nable to avoid her anger for such his extravagance; but when Bernice was\r\ndead, and he was left to his own conduct, he spent a great deal\r\nextravagantly in his daily way of living, and a great deal in the\r\nimmoderate presents he made, and those chiefly among Cæsar's freed-men,\r\nin order to gain their assistance, insomuch that he was, in a little\r\ntime, reduced to poverty, and could not live at Rome any longer.\r\nTiberius also forbade the friends of his deceased son to come into his\r\nsight, because on seeing them he should be put in mind of his son, and\r\nhis grief would thereby be revived.\r\n\r\n2. For these reasons he went away from Rome, and sailed to Judea, but in\r\nevil circumstances, being dejected with the loss of that money which he\r\nonce had, and because he had not wherewithal to pay his creditors, who\r\nwere many in number, and such as gave him no room for escaping them.\r\nWhereupon he knew not what to do; so, for shame of his present\r\ncondition, he retired to a certain tower, at Malatha, in Idumea, and had\r\nthoughts of killing himself; but his wife Cypros perceived his\r\nintentions, and tried all sorts of methods to divert him from his taking\r\nsuch a course; so she sent a letter to his sister Herodias, who was now\r\nthe wife of Herod the tetrarch, and let her know Agrippa's present\r\ndesign, and what necessity it was which drove him thereto, and desired\r\nher, as a kinswoman of his, to give him her help, and to engage her\r\nhusband to do the same, since she saw how she alleviated these her\r\nhusband's troubles all she could, although she had not the like wealth\r\nto do it withal. So they sent for him, and allotted him Tiberias for his\r\nhabitation, and appointed him some income of money for his maintenance,\r\nand made him a magistrate of that city, by way of honor to him. Yet did\r\nnot Herod long continue in that resolution of supporting him, though\r\neven that support was not sufficient for him; for as once they were at a\r\nfeast at Tyre, and in their cups, and reproaches were cast upon one\r\nanother, Agrippa thought that was not to be borne, while Herod hit him\r\nin the teeth with his poverty, and with his owing his necessary food to\r\nhim. So he went to Flaccus, one that had been consul, and had been a\r\nvery great friend to him at Rome formerly, and was now president of\r\nSyria.\r\n\r\n3. Hereupon Flaccus received him kindly, and he lived with him. Flaccus\r\nhad also with him there Aristobulus, who was indeed Agrippa's brother,\r\nbut was at variance with him; yet did not their enmity to one another\r\nhinder the friendship of Flaccus to them both, but still they were\r\nhonorably treated by him. However, Aristobulus did not abate of his ill-\r\nwill to Agrippa, till at length he brought him into ill terms with\r\nFlaccus; the occasion of bringing on which estrangement was this: The\r\nDamascens were at difference with the Sidonians about their limits, and\r\nwhen Flaccus was about to hear the cause between them, they understood\r\nthat Agrippa had a mighty influence upon him; so they desired that he\r\nwould be of their side, and for that favor promised him a great deal of\r\nmoney; so he was zealous in assisting the Damascens as far as he was\r\nable. Now Aristobulus had gotten intelligence of this promise of money\r\nto him, and accused him to Flaccus of the same; and when, upon a\r\nthorough examination of the matter, it appeared plainly so to be, he\r\nrejected Agrippa out of the number of his friends. So he was reduced to\r\nthe utmost necessity, and came to Ptolemais; and because he knew not\r\nwhere else to get a livelihood, he thought to sail to Italy; but as he\r\nwas restrained from so doing by want of money, he desired Marsyas, who\r\nwas his freed-man, to find some method for procuring him so much as he\r\nwanted for that purpose, by borrowing such a sum of some person or\r\nother. So Marsyas desired of Peter, who was the freed-man of Bernice,\r\nAgrippa's mother, and by the right of her testament was bequeathed to\r\nAntonia, to lend so much upon Agrippa's own bond and security; but he\r\naccused Agrippa of having defrauded him of certain sums of money, and so\r\nobliged Marsyas, when he made the bond of twenty thousand Attic\r\ndrachmae, to accept of twenty-five hundred drachma as 18 less than what\r\nhe desired, which the other allowed of, because he could not help it.\r\nUpon the receipt of this money, Agrippa came to Anthedon, and took\r\nshipping, and was going to set sail; but Herennius Capito, who was the\r\nprocurator of Jamhis, sent a band of soldiers to demand of him three\r\nhundred thousand drachmae of silver, which were by him owing to Cæsar's\r\ntreasury while he was at Rome, and so forced him to stay. He then\r\npretended that he would do as he bid him; but when night came on, he cut\r\nhis cables, and went off, and sailed to Alexandria, where he desired\r\nAlexander the alabarch 19 to lend him two hundred thousand drachmae; but\r\nhe said he would not lend it to him, but would not refuse it to Cypros,\r\nas greatly astonished at her affection to her husband, and at the other\r\ninstances of her virtue; so she undertook to repay it. Accordingly,\r\nAlexander paid them five talents at Alexandria, and promised to pay them\r\nthe rest of that sum at Dicearchia [Puteoli]; and this he did out of the\r\nfear he was in that Agrippa would soon spend it. So this Cypros set her\r\nhusband free, and dismissed him to go on with his navigation to Italy,\r\nwhile she and her children departed for Judea.\r\n\r\n4. And now Agrippa was come to Puteoli, whence he wrote a letter to\r\nTiberius Cæsar, who then lived at Capreae, and told him that he was come\r\nso far in order to wait on him, and to pay him a visit; and desired that\r\nhe would give him leave to come over to Caprein: so Tiberius made no\r\ndifficulty, but wrote to him in an obliging way in other respects; and\r\nwithal told him he was glad of his safe return, and desired him to come\r\nto Capreae; and when he was come, he did not fail to treat him as kindly\r\nas he had promised him in his letter to do. But the next day came a\r\nletter to Cæsar from Herennius Capito, to inform him that Agrippa had\r\nborrowed three hundred thousand drachmae, and not pad it at the time\r\nappointed; but when it was demanded of him, he ran away like a fugitive,\r\nout of the places under his government, and put it out of his power to\r\nget the money of him. When Cæsar had read this letter, he was much\r\ntroubled at it, and gave order that Agrippa should be excluded from his\r\npresence until he had paid that debt: upon which he was no way daunted\r\nat Cæsar's anger, but entreated Antonia, the mother of Germanicus, and\r\nof Claudius, who was afterward Cæsar himself, to lend him those three\r\nhundred thousand drachmae, that he might not be deprived of Tiberius's\r\nfriendship; so, out of regard to the memory of Bernice his mother, [for\r\nthose two women were very familiar with one another,] and out of regard\r\nto his and Claudius's education together, she lent him the money; and,\r\nupon the payment of this debt, there was nothing to hinder Tiberius's\r\nfriendship to him. After this, Tiberius Cæsar recommended to him his\r\ngrandson, 20 and ordered that he should always accompany him when he\r\nwent abroad. But upon Agrippa's kind reception by Antonia, he betook him\r\nto pay his respects to Caius, who was her grandson, and in very high\r\nreputation by reason of the good-will they bare his father. Now there\r\nwas one Thallus, a freed-man of Cæsar, of whom he borrowed a million of\r\ndrachmae, and thence repaid Antonia the debt he owed her; and by sending\r\nthe overplus in paying his court to Caius, became a person of great\r\nauthority with him.\r\n\r\n5. Now as the friendship which Agrippa had for Caius was come to a great\r\nheight, there happened some words to pass between them, as they once\r\nwere in a chariot together, concerning Tiberius; Agrippa praying [to\r\nGod] [for they two sat by themselves] that Tiberius might soon go off\r\nthe stage, and leave the government to Caius, who was in every respect\r\nmore worthy of it. Now Eutychus, who was Agrippa's freed-man, and drove\r\nhis chariot, heard these words, and at that time said nothing of them;\r\nbut when Agrippa accused him of stealing some garments of his, [which\r\nwas certainly true,] he ran away from him; but when he was caught, and\r\nbrought before Piso, who was governor of the city, and the man was asked\r\nwhy he ran away, he replied, that he had somewhat to say to Cæsar, that\r\ntended to his security and preservation: so Piso bound him, and sent him\r\nto Capreae. But Tiberius, according to his usual custom, kept him still\r\nin bonds, being a delayer of affairs, if ever there was any other king\r\nor tyrant that was so; for he did not admit ambassadors quickly, and no\r\nsuccessors were despatched away to governors or procurators of the\r\nprovinces that had been formerly sent, unless they were dead; whence it\r\nwas that he was so negligent in hearing the causes of prisoners;\r\ninsomuch that when he was asked by his friends what was the reason of\r\nhis delay in such cases, he said that he delayed to hear ambassadors,\r\nlest, upon their quick dismission, other ambassadors should be\r\nappointed, and return upon him; and so he should bring trouble upon\r\nhimself in their public reception and dismission: that he permitted\r\nthose governors who had been sent once to their government [to stay\r\nthere a long while], out of regard to the subjects that were under them;\r\nfor that all governors are naturally disposed to get as much as they\r\ncan; and that those who are not to fix there, but to stay a short time,\r\nand that at an uncertainty when they shall be turned out, do the more\r\nseverely hurry themselves on to fleece the people; but that if their\r\ngovernment be long continued to them; they are at last satiated with the\r\nspoils, as having gotten a vast deal, and so become at length less sharp\r\nin their pillaging; but that if successors are sent quickly, the poor\r\nsubjects, who are exposed to them as a prey, will not be able to bear\r\nthe new ones, while they shall not have the same time allowed them\r\nwherein their predecessors had filled themselves, and so grew more\r\nunconcerned about getting more; and this because they are removed before\r\nthey have had time [for their oppressions]. He gave them an example to\r\nshow his meaning: A great number of flies came about the sore places of\r\na man that had been wounded; upon which one of the standers-by pitied\r\nthe man's misfortune, and thinking he was not able to drive those flies\r\naway himself, was going to drive them away for him; but he prayed him to\r\nlet them alone: the other, by way of reply, asked him the reason of such\r\na preposterous proceeding, in preventing relief from his present misery;\r\nto which he answered, \"If thou drivest these flies away, thou wilt hurt\r\nme worse; for as these are already full of my blood, they do not crowd\r\nabout me, nor pain me so much as before, but are somewhat more remiss,\r\nwhile the fresh ones that come almost famished, and find me quite tired\r\ndown already, will be my destruction. For this cause, therefore, it is\r\nthat I am myself careful not to send such new governors perpetually to\r\nthose my subjects, who are already sufficiently harassed by many\r\noppressions, as may, like these flies, further distress them; and so,\r\nbesides their natural desire of gain, may have this additional\r\nincitement to it, that they expect to be suddenly deprived of that\r\npleasure which they take in it.\" And, as a further attestation to what I\r\nsay of the dilatory nature of Tiberius, I appeal to this his practice\r\nitself; for although he was emperor twenty-two years, he sent in all but\r\ntwo procurators to govern the nation of the Jews, Gratus, and his\r\nsuccessor in the government, Pilate. Nor was he in one way of acting\r\nwith respect to the Jews, and in another with respect to the rest of his\r\nsubjects. He further informed them, that even in the hearing of the\r\ncauses of prisoners, he made such delays, because immediate death to\r\nthose that must be condemned to die would be an alleviation of their\r\npresent miseries, while those wicked wretches have not deserved any such\r\nfavor; \"but I do it, that, by being harassed with the present calamity,\r\nthey may undergo greater misery.\"\r\n\r\n6. On this account it was that Eutychus could not obtain a bearing, but\r\nwas kept still in prison. However, some time afterward, Tiberius came\r\nfrom Capreae to Tusculanum, which is about a hundred furlongs from Rome.\r\nAgrippa then desired of Antonia that she would procure a hearing for\r\nEutychus, let the matter whereof he accused him prove what it would. Now\r\nAntonia was greatly esteemed by Tiberius on all accounts, from the\r\ndignity of her relation to him, who had been his brother Drusus's wife,\r\nand from her eminent chastity; 21 for though she was still a young\r\nwoman, she continued in her widowhood, and refused all other matches,\r\nalthough Augustus had enjoined her to be married to somebody else; yet\r\ndid she all along preserve her reputation free from reproach. She had\r\nalso been the greatest benefactress to Tiberius, when there was a very\r\ndangerous plot laid against him by Sejanus, a man who had been her\r\nhusband's friend, and who had the greatest authority, because he was\r\ngeneral of the army, and when many members of the senate and many of the\r\nfreed-men joined with him, and the soldiery was corrupted, and the plot\r\nwas come to a great height. Now Sejanus had certainly gained his point,\r\nhad not Antonia's boldness been more wisely conducted than Sejanus's\r\nmalice; for when she had discovered his designs against Tiberius, she\r\nwrote him an exact account of the whole, and gave the letter to Pallas,\r\nthe most faithful of her servants, and sent him to Caprere to Tiberius,\r\nwho, when he understood it, slew Sejanus and his confederates; so that\r\nTiberius, who had her in great esteem before, now looked upon her with\r\nstill greater respect, and depended upon her in all things. So when\r\nTiberius was desired by this Antonia to examine Eutychus, he answered,\r\n\"If indeed Eutychus hath falsely accused Agrippa in what he hath said of\r\nhim, he hath had sufficient punishment by what I have done to him\r\nalready; but if, upon examination, the accusation appears to be true,\r\nlet Agrippa have a care, lest, out of desire of punishing his freed-man,\r\nhe do not rather bring a punishment upon himself.\" Now when Antonia told\r\nAgrippa of this, he was still much more pressing that the matter might\r\nbe examined into; so Antonia, upon Agrippa's lying hard at her\r\ncontinually to beg this favor, took the following opportunity: As\r\nTiberius lay once at his ease upon his sedan, and was carried about, and\r\nCaius, her grandson, and Agrippa, were before him after dinner she\r\nwalked by the sedan, and desired him to call Eutychus, and have him\r\nexamined; to which he replied, \"O Antonia! the gods are my witnesses\r\nthat I am induced to do what I am going to do, not by my own\r\ninclination, but because I am forced to it by thy prayers.\" When he had\r\nsaid this, he ordered Macro, who succeeded Sejanus, to bring Eutychus to\r\nhim; accordingly, without any delay, he was brought. Then Tiberius asked\r\nhim what he had to say against a man who had given him his liberty. Upon\r\nwhich he said, \"O my lord! this Caius, and Agrippa with him, were once\r\nriding in a chariot, when I sat at their feet, and, among other\r\ndiscourses that passed, Agrippa said to Caius, Oh that the day would\r\nonce come when this old fellow will die and name thee for the governor\r\nof the habitable earth! for then this Tiberius, his grandson, would be\r\nno hinderance, but would be taken off by thee, and that earth would be\r\nhappy, and I happy also.\" Now Tiberius took these to be truly Agrippa's\r\nwords, and bearing a grudge withal at Agrippa, because, when he had\r\ncommanded him to pay his respects to Tiberius, his grandson, and the son\r\nof Drusus, Agrippa had not paid him that respect, but had disobeyed his\r\ncommands, and transferred all his regard to Caius; he said to Macro,\r\n\"Bind this man.\" But Macro, not distinctly knowing which of them it was\r\nwhom he bid him bind, and not expecting that he would have any such\r\nthing done to Agrippa, he forbore, and came to ask more distinctly what\r\nit was that he said. But when Cæsar had gone round the hippodrome, he\r\nfound Agrippa standing: \"For certain,\" said he, \"Macro, this is the man\r\nI meant to have bound;\" and when he still asked, \"Which of these is to\r\nbe bound?\" he said \"Agrippa.\" Upon which Agrippa betook himself to make\r\nsupplication for himself, putting him in mind of his son, with whom he\r\nwas brought up, and of Tiberius [his grandson] whom he had educated; but\r\nall to no purpose; for they led him about bound even in his purple\r\ngarments. It was also very hot weather, and they had but little wine to\r\ntheir meal, so that he was very thirsty; he was also in a sort of agony,\r\nand took this treatment of him heinously: as he therefore saw one of\r\nCaius's slaves, whose name was Thaumastus, carrying some water in a\r\nvessel, he desired that he would let him drink; so the servant gave him\r\nsome water to drink, and he drank heartily, and said, \"O thou boy! this\r\nservice of thine to me will be for thy advantage; for if I once get\r\nclear of these my bonds, I will soon procure thee thy freedom of Caius\r\nwho has not been wanting to minister to me now I am in bonds, in the\r\nsame manner as when I was in my former state and dignity.\" Nor did he\r\ndeceive him in what he promised him, but made him amends for what he had\r\nnow done; for when afterward Agrippa was come to the kingdom, he took\r\nparticular care of Thaumastus, and got him his liberty from Caius, and\r\nmade him the steward over his own estate; and when he died, he left him\r\nto Agrippa his son, and to Bernice his daughter, to minister to them in\r\nthe same capacity. The man also grew old in that honorable post, and\r\ntherein died. But all this happened a good while later.\r\n\r\n7. Now Agrippa stood in his bonds before the royal palace, and leaned on\r\na certain tree for grief, with many others, who were in bonds also; and\r\nas a certain bird sat upon the tree on which Agrippa leaned, [the Romans\r\ncall this bird bubo,] [an owl,] one of those that were bound, a German\r\nby nation, saw him, and asked a soldier who that man in purple was; and\r\nwhen he was informed that his name was Agrippa, and that he was by\r\nnation a Jew, and one of the principal men of that nation, he asked\r\nleave of the soldier to whom he was bound, 22 to let him come nearer to\r\nhim, to speak with him; for that he had a mind to inquire of him about\r\nsome things relating to his country; which liberty, when he had\r\nobtained, and as he stood near him, he said thus to him by an\r\ninterpreter: \"This sudden change of thy condition, O young man! is\r\ngrievous to thee, as bringing on thee a manifold and very great\r\nadversity; nor wilt thou believe me, when I foretell how thou wilt get\r\nclear of this misery which thou art now under, and how Divine Providence\r\nwill provide for thee. Know therefore [and I appeal to my own country\r\ngods, as well as to the gods of this place, who have awarded these bonds\r\nto us] that all I am going to say about thy concerns shall neither be\r\nsaid for favor nor bribery, nor out of an endeavor to make thee cheerful\r\nwithout cause; for such predictions, when they come to fail, make the\r\ngrief at last, and in earnest, more bitter than if the party had never\r\nheard of any such thing. However, though I run the hazard of my own\r\nself, I think it fit to declare to thee the prediction of the gods. It\r\ncannot be that thou shouldst long continue in these bonds; but thou wilt\r\nsoon be delivered from them, and wilt be promoted to the highest dignity\r\nand power, and thou wilt be envied by all those who now pity thy hard\r\nfortune; and thou wilt be happy till thy death, and wilt leave thine\r\nhappiness to the children whom thou shalt have. But do thou remember,\r\nwhen thou seest this bird again, that thou wilt then live but five days\r\nlonger. This event will be brought to pass by that God who hath sent\r\nthis bird hither to be a sign unto thee. And I cannot but think it\r\nunjust to conceal from thee what I foreknow concerning thee, that, by\r\nthy knowing beforehand what happiness is coming upon thee, thou mayst\r\nnot regard thy present misfortunes. But when this happiness shall\r\nactually befall thee, do not forget what misery I am in myself, but\r\nendeavor to deliver me.\" So when the German had said this, he made\r\nAgrippa laugh at him as much as he afterwards appeared worthy of\r\nadmiration. But now Antonia took Agrippa's misfortune to heart: however,\r\nto speak to Tiberius on his behalf, she took to be a very difficult\r\nthing, and indeed quite impracticable, as to any hope of success; yet\r\ndid she procure of Macro, that the soldiers that kept him should be of a\r\ngentle nature, and that the centurion who was over them and was to diet\r\nwith him, should be of the same disposition, and that he might have\r\nleave to bathe himself every day, and that his freed-men and friends\r\nmight come to him, and that other things that tended to ease him might\r\nbe indulged him. So his friend Silas came in to him, and two of his\r\nfreed-men, Marsyas and Stechus, brought him such sorts of food as he was\r\nfond of, and indeed took great care of him; they also brought him\r\ngarments, under pretense of selling them; and when night came on, they\r\nlaid them under him; and the soldiers assisted them, as Macro had given\r\nthem order to do beforehand. And this was Agrippa's condition for six\r\nmonths' time, and in this case were his affairs.\r\n\r\n8. But for Tiberius, upon his return to Caprein, he fell sick. At first\r\nhis distemper was but gentle; but as that distemper increased upon him,\r\nhe had small or no hopes of recovery. Hereupon he bid Euodus, who was\r\nthat freed-man whom he most of all respected, to bring the children 23\r\nto him, for that he wanted to talk to them before he died. Now he had at\r\npresent no sons of his own alive for Drusus, who was his only son, was\r\ndead; but Drusus's son Tiberius was still living, whose additional name\r\nwas Gemellus: there was also living Caius, the son of Germanicus, who\r\nwas the son 24 of his brother [Drusus]. He was now grown up, and had a\r\nliberal education, and was well improved by it, and was in esteem and\r\nfavor with the people, on account of the excellent character of his\r\nfather Germanicus, who had attained the highest honor among the\r\nmultitude, by the firmness of his virtuous behavior, by the easiness and\r\nagreeableness of his conversing with the multitude, and because the\r\ndignity he was in did not hinder his familiarity with them all, as if\r\nthey were his equals; by which behavior he was not only greatly esteemed\r\nby the people and the senate, but by every one of those nations that\r\nwere subject to the Romans; some of which were affected when they came\r\nto him with the gracefulness of their reception by him, and others were\r\naffected in the same manner by the report of the others that had been\r\nwith him; and, upon his death, there was a lamentation made by all men;\r\nnot such a one as was to be made in way of flattery to their rulers,\r\nwhile they did but counterfeit sorrow, but such as was real; while every\r\nbody grieved at his death, as if they had lost one that was near to\r\nthem. And truly such had been his easy conversation with men, that it\r\nturned greatly to the advantage of his son among all; and, among others,\r\nthe soldiery were so peculiarly affected to him, that they reckoned it\r\nan eligible thing, if need were, to die themselves, if he might but\r\nattain to the government.\r\n\r\n9. But when Tiberius had given order to Euodus to bring the children to\r\nhim the next day in the morning, he prayed to his country gods to show\r\nhim a manifest signal which of those children should come to the\r\ngovernment; being very desirous to leave it to his son's son, but still\r\ndepending upon what God should foreshow concerning them more than upon\r\nhis own opinion and inclination; so he made this to be the omen, that\r\nthe government should be left to him who should come to him first the\r\nnext day. When he had thus resolved within himself, he sent to his\r\ngrandson's tutor, and ordered him to bring the child to him early in the\r\nmorning, as supposing that God would permit him to be made emperor. But\r\nGod proved opposite to his designation; for while Tiberius was thus\r\ncontriving matters, and as soon as it was at all day, he bid Euodus to\r\ncall in that child which should be there ready. So he went out, and\r\nfound Caius before the door, for Tiberius was not yet come, but staid\r\nwaiting for his breakfast; for Euodus knew nothing of what his lord\r\nintended; so he said to Caius, \"Thy father calls thee,\" and then brought\r\nhim in. As soon as Tiberius saw Caius, and not before, he reflected on\r\nthe power of God, and how the ability of bestowing the government on\r\nwhom he would was entirely taken from him; and thence he was not able to\r\nestablish what he had intended. So he greatly lamented that his power of\r\nestablishing what he had before contrived was taken from him, and that\r\nhis grandson Tiberius was not only to lose the Roman empire by his\r\nfatality, but his own safety also, because his preservation would now\r\ndepend upon such as would be more potent than himself, who would think\r\nit a thing not to be borne, that a kinsman should live with them, and so\r\nhis relation would not be able to protect him; but he would be feared\r\nand hated by him who had the supreme authority, partly on account of his\r\nbeing next to the empire, and partly on account of his perpetually\r\ncontriving to get the government, both in order to preserve himself, and\r\nto be at the head of affairs also. Now Tiberius had been very much given\r\nto astrology, 25 and the calculation of nativities, and had spent his\r\nlife in the esteem of what predictions had proved true, more than those\r\nwhose profession it was. Accordingly, when he once saw Galba coming in\r\nto him, he said to his most intimate friends, that there came in a man\r\nthat would one day have the dignity of the Roman empire. So that this\r\nTiberius was more addicted to all such sorts of diviners than any other\r\nof the Roman emperors, because he had found them to have told him truth\r\nin his own affairs. And indeed he was now in great distress upon this\r\naccident that had befallen him, and was very much grieved at the\r\ndestruction of his son's son, which he foresaw, and complained of\r\nhimself, that he should have made use of such a method of divination\r\nbeforehand, while it was in his power to have died without grief by this\r\nknowledge of futurity; whereas he was now tormented by his foreknowledge\r\nof the misfortune of such as were dearest to him, and must die under\r\nthat torment. Now although he was disordered at this unexpected\r\nrevolution of the government to those for whom he did not intend it, he\r\nspake thus to Caius, though unwillingly, and against his own\r\ninclination: \"O child! although Tiberius be nearer related to me than\r\nthou art, I, by my own determination, and the conspiring suffrage of the\r\ngods, do give and put into thy hand the Roman empire; and I desire thee\r\nnever to be unmindful when thou comest to it, either of my kindness to\r\nthee, who set thee in so high a dignity, or of thy relation to Tiberius.\r\nBut as thou knowest that I am, together with and after the gods, the\r\nprocurer of so great happiness to thee; so I desire that thou wilt make\r\nme a return for my readiness to assist thee, and wilt take care of\r\nTiberius because of his near relation to thee. Besides which, thou art\r\nto know, that while Tiberius is alive, he will be a security to thee,\r\nboth as to empire and as to thy own preservation; but if he die, that\r\nwill be but a prelude to thy own misfortunes; for to be alone under the\r\nweight of such vast affairs is very dangerous; nor will the gods suffer\r\nthose actions which are unjustly done, contrary to that law which\r\ndirects men to act otherwise, to go off unpunished.\" This was the speech\r\nwhich Tiberius made, which did not persuade Caius to act accordingly,\r\nalthough he promised so to do; but when he was settled in the\r\ngovernment, he took off this Tiberius, as was predicted by the other\r\nTiberius; as he was also himself, in no long time afterward, slain by a\r\nsecret plot laid against him.\r\n\r\n10. So when Tiberius had at this time appointed Caius to be his\r\nsuccessor, he outlived but a few days, and then died, after he had held\r\nthe government twenty-two years five months and three days. Now Caius\r\nwas the fourth emperor. But when the Romans understood that Tiberius was\r\ndead, they rejoiced at the good news, but had not courage to believe it;\r\nnot because they were unwilling it should be true, for they would have\r\ngiven huge sums of money that it might be so, but because they were\r\nafraid, that if they had showed their joy when the news proved false,\r\ntheir joy should be openly known, and they should be accused for it, and\r\nbe thereby undone. For this Tiberius had brought a vast number of\r\nmiseries on the best families of the Romans, since he was easily\r\ninflamed with passion in all cases, and was of such a temper as rendered\r\nhis anger irrevocable, till he had executed the same, although he had\r\ntaken a hatred against men without reason; for he was by nature fierce\r\nin all the sentences he gave, and made death the penalty for the\r\nlightest offenses; insomuch that when the Romans heard the rumor about\r\nhis death gladly, they were restrained from the enjoyment of that\r\npleasure by the dread of such miseries as they foresaw would follow, if\r\ntheir hopes proved ill-grounded. Now Marsyas, Agrippa's freed-man, as\r\nsoon as he heard of Tiberius's death, came running to tell Agrippa the\r\nnews; and finding him going out to the bath, he gave him a nod, and\r\nsaid, in the Hebrew tongue, \"The lion 26 is dead;\" who, understanding\r\nhis meaning, and being overjoyed at the news, \"Nay,\" said he, \"but all\r\nsorts of thanks and happiness attend thee for this news of thine; only I\r\nwish that what thou sayest may prove true.\" Now the centurion who was\r\nset to keep Agrippa, when he saw with what haste Marsyas came, and what\r\njoy Agrippa had from what he said, he had a suspicion that his words\r\nimplied some great innovation of affairs, and he asked them about what\r\nwas said. They at first diverted the discourse; but upon his further\r\npressing, Agrippa, without more ado, told him, for he was already become\r\nhis friend; so he joined with him in that pleasure which this news\r\noccasioned, because it would be fortunate to Agrippa, and made him a\r\nsupper. But as they were feasting, and the cups went about, there came\r\none who said that Tiberius was still alive, and would return to the city\r\nin a few days. At which news the centurion was exceedingly troubled,\r\nbecause he had done what might cost him his life, to have treated so\r\njoyfully a prisoner, and this upon the news of the death of Cæsar; so he\r\nthrust Agrippa from the couch whereon he lay, and said, \"Dost thou think\r\nto cheat me by a lie about the emperor without punishment? and shalt not\r\nthou pay for this thy malicious report at the price of thine head?\" When\r\nhe had so said, he ordered Agrippa to be bound again, [for he had loosed\r\nhim before,] and kept a severer guard over him than formerly, and in\r\nthat evil condition was Agrippa that night; but the next day the rumor\r\nincreased in the city, and confirmed the news that Tiberius was\r\ncertainly dead; insomuch that men durst now openly and freely talk about\r\nit; nay, some offered sacrifices on that account. Several letters also\r\ncame from Caius; one of them to the senate, which informed them of the\r\ndeath of Tiberius, and of his own entrance on the government; another to\r\nPiso, the governor of the city, which told him the same thing. He also\r\ngave order that Agrippa should be removed out of the camp, and go to\r\nthat house where he lived before he was put in prison; so that he was\r\nnow out of fear as to his own affairs; for although he was still in\r\ncustody, yet it was now with ease to his own affairs. Now, as soon as\r\nCaius was come to Rome, and had brought Tiberius's dead body with him,\r\nand had made a sumptuous funeral for him, according to the laws of his\r\ncountry, he was much disposed to set Agrippa at liberty that very day;\r\nbut Antonia hindered him, not out of any ill-will to the prisoner, but\r\nout of regard to decency in Caius, lest that should make men believe\r\nthat he received the death of Tiberius with pleasure, when he loosed one\r\nwhom he had bound immediately. However, there did not many days pass ere\r\nhe sent for him to his house, and had him shaved, and made him change\r\nhis raiment; after which he put a diadem upon his head, and appointed\r\nhim to be king of the tetrarchy of Philip. He also gave him the\r\ntetrarchy of Lysanias, 27 and changed his iron chain for a golden one of\r\nequal weight. He also sent Marullus to be procurator of Judea.\r\n\r\n11. Now, in the second year of the reign of Caius Cæsar, Agrippa desired\r\nleave to be given him to sail home, and settle the affairs of his\r\ngovernment; and he promised to return again, when he had put the rest in\r\norder, as it ought to be put. So, upon the emperor's permission, he came\r\ninto his own country, and appeared to them all unexpectedly as asking,\r\nand thereby demonstrated to the men that saw him the power of fortune,\r\nwhen they compared his former poverty with his present happy affluence;\r\nso some called him a happy man, and others could not well believe that\r\nthings were so much changed with him for the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. How Herod The Tetrarch Was Banished.\r\n\r\n1. But Herodias, Agrippa's sister, who now lived as wife to that Herod\r\nwho was tetrarch of Galilee and Peres, took this authority of her\r\nbrother in an envious manner, particularly when she saw that he had a\r\ngreater dignity bestowed on him than her husband had; since, when he ran\r\naway, it was because he was not able to pay his debts; and now he was\r\ncome back, he was in a way of dignity, and of great good fortune. She\r\nwas therefore grieved and much displeased at so great a mutation of his\r\naffairs; and chiefly when she saw him marching among the multitude with\r\nthe usual ensigns of royal authority, she was not able to conceal how\r\nmiserable she was, by reason of the envy she had towards him; but she\r\nexcited her husband, and desired him that he would sail to Rome, to\r\ncourt honors equal to his; for she said that she could not bear to live\r\nany longer, while Agrippa, the son of that Aristobulus who was condemned\r\nto die by his father, one that came to her husband in such extreme\r\npoverty, that the necessaries of life were forced to be entirely\r\nsupplied him day by day; and when he fled away from his creditors by\r\nsea, he now returned a king; while he was himself the son of a king, and\r\nwhile the near relation he bare to royal authority called upon him to\r\ngain the like dignity, he sat still, and was contented with a privater\r\nlife. \"But then, Herod, although thou wast formerly not concerned to be\r\nin a lower condition than thy father from whom thou wast derived had\r\nbeen, yet do thou now seek after the dignity which thy kinsman hath\r\nattained to; and do not thou bear this contempt, that a man who admired\r\nthy riches should be in greater honor than thyself, nor suffer his\r\npoverty to show itself able to purchase greater things than our\r\nabundance; nor do thou esteem it other than a shameful thing to be\r\ninferior to one who, the other day, lived upon thy charity. But let us\r\ngo to Rome, and let us spare no pains nor expenses, either of silver or\r\ngold, since they cannot be kept for any better use than for the\r\nobtaining of a kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n2. But for Herod, he opposed her request at this time, out of the love\r\nof ease, and having a suspicion of the trouble he should have at Rome;\r\nso he tried to instruct her better. But the more she saw him draw back,\r\nthe more she pressed him to it, and desired him to leave no stone\r\nunturned in order to be king; and at last she left not off till she\r\nengaged him, whether he would or not, to be of her sentiments, because\r\nhe could no otherwise avoid her importunity. So he got all things ready,\r\nafter as sumptuous a manner as he was able, and spared for nothing, and\r\nwent up to Rome, and took Herodias along with him. But Agrippa, when he\r\nwas made sensible of their intentions and preparations, he also prepared\r\nto go thither; and as soon as he heard they set sail, he sent\r\nFortunatus, one of his freed-men, to Rome, to carry presents to the\r\nemperor, and letters against Herod, and to give Caius a particular\r\naccount of those matters, if he should have any opportunity. This man\r\nfollowed Herod so quick, and had so prosperous a voyage, and came so\r\nlittle after Herod, that while Herod was with Caius, he came himself,\r\nand delivered his letters; for they both sailed to Dicearchia, and found\r\nCaius at Bairn, which is itself a little city of Campania, at the\r\ndistance of about five furlongs from Dicearchia. There are in that place\r\nroyal palaces, with sumptuous apartments, every emperor still\r\nendeavoring to outdo his predecessor's magnificence; the place also\r\naffords warm baths, that spring out of the ground of their own accord,\r\nwhich are of advantage for the recovery of the health of those that make\r\nuse of them; and, besides, they minister to men's luxury also. Now Caius\r\nsaluted Herod, for he first met with him, and then looked upon the\r\nletters which Agrippa had sent him, and which were written in order to\r\naccuse Herod; wherein he accused him, that he had been in confederacy\r\nwith Sejanus against Tiberius's and that he was now confederate with\r\nArtabanus, the king of Parthia, in opposition to the government of\r\nCaius; as a demonstration of which he alleged, that he had armor\r\nsufficient for seventy thousand men ready in his armory. Caius was moved\r\nat this information, and asked Herod whether what was said about the\r\narmor was true; and when he confessed there was such armor there, for he\r\ncould not deny the same, the truth of it being too notorious, Caius took\r\nthat to be a sufficient proof of the accusation, that he intended to\r\nrevolt. So he took away from him his tetrarchy, and gave it by way of\r\naddition to Agrippa's kingdom; he also gave Herod's money to Agrippa,\r\nand, by way of punishment, awarded him a perpetual banishment, and\r\nappointed Lyons, a city of Gaul, to be his place of habitation. But when\r\nhe was informed that Herodias was Agrippa's sister, he made her a\r\npresent of what money was her own, and told her that it was her brother\r\nwho prevented her being put under the same calamity with her husband.\r\nBut she made this reply: \"Thou, indeed, O emperor! actest after a\r\nmagnificent manner, and as becomes thyself in what thou offerest me; but\r\nthe kindness which I have for my husband hinders me from partaking of\r\nthe favor of thy gift; for it is not just that I, who have been made a\r\npartner in his prosperity, should forsake him in his misfortunes.\"\r\nHereupon Caius was angry at her, and sent her with Herod into\r\nbanishment, and gave her estate to Agrippa. And thus did God punish\r\nHerodias for her envy at her brother, and Herod also for giving ear to\r\nthe vain discourses of a woman. Now Caius managed public affairs with\r\ngreat magnanimity during the first and second year of his reign, and\r\nbehaved himself with such moderation, that he gained the good-will of\r\nthe Romans themselves, and of his other subjects. But, in process of\r\ntime, he went beyond the bounds of human nature in his conceit of\r\nhimself, and by reason of the vastness of his dominions made himself a\r\ngod, and took upon himself to act in all things to the reproach of the\r\nDeity itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. Concerning The Embassage Of The Jews To Caius; 28 And How\r\nCaius Sent Petronius Into Syria To Make War Against The Jews, Unless\r\nThey Would Receive His Statue.\r\n\r\n1. There was now a tumult arisen at Alexandria, between the Jewish\r\ninhabitants and the Greeks; and three ambassadors were chosen out of\r\neach party that were at variance, who came to Caius. Now one of these\r\nambassadors from the people of Alexandria was Apion, 29 who uttered many\r\nblasphemies against the Jews; and, among other things that he said, he\r\ncharged them with neglecting the honors that belonged to Cæsar; for that\r\nwhile all who were subject to the Roman empire built altars and temples\r\nto Caius, and in other regards universally received him as they received\r\nthe gods, these Jews alone thought it a dishonorable thing for them to\r\nerect statues in honor of him, as well as to swear by his name. Many of\r\nthese severe things were said by Apion, by which he hoped to provoke\r\nCaius to anger at the Jews, as he was likely to be. But Philo, the\r\nprincipal of the Jewish embassage, a man eminent on all accounts,\r\nbrother to Alexander the alabarch, 30 and one not unskillful in\r\nphilosophy, was ready to betake himself to make his defense against\r\nthose accusations; but Caius prohibited him, and bid him begone; he was\r\nalso in such a rage, that it openly appeared he was about to do them\r\nsome very great mischief. So Philo being thus affronted, went out, and\r\nsaid to those Jews who were about him, that they should be of good\r\ncourage, since Caius's words indeed showed anger at them, but in reality\r\nhad already set God against himself.\r\n\r\n2. Hereupon Caius, taking it very heinously that he should be thus\r\ndespised by the Jews alone, sent Petronius to be president of Syria, and\r\nsuccessor in the government to Vitellius, and gave him order to make an\r\ninvasion into Judea, with a great body of troops; and if they would\r\nadmit of his statue willingly, to erect it in the temple of God; but if\r\nthey were obstinate, to conquer them by war, and then to do it.\r\nAccordingly, Petronius took the government of Syria, and made haste to\r\nobey Cæsar's epistle. He got together as great a number of auxiliaries\r\nas he possibly could, and took with him two legions of the Roman army,\r\nand came to Ptolemais, and there wintered, as intending to set about the\r\nwar in the spring. He also wrote word to Caius what he had resolved to\r\ndo, who commended him for his alacrity, and ordered him to go on, and to\r\nmake war with them, in case they would not obey his commands. But there\r\ncame many ten thousands of the Jews to Petronius, to Ptolemais, to offer\r\ntheir petitions to him, that he would not compel them to transgress and\r\nviolate the law of their forefathers; \"but if,\" said they, \"thou art\r\nentirely resolved to bring this statue, and erect it, do thou first kill\r\nus, and then do what thou hast resolved on; for while we are alive we\r\ncannot permit such things as are forbidden us to be done by the\r\nauthority of our legislator, and by our forefathers' determination that\r\nsuch prohibitions are instances of virtue.\" But Petronius was angry at\r\nthem, and said, \"If indeed I were myself emperor, and were at liberty to\r\nfollow my own inclination, and then had designed to act thus, these your\r\nwords would be justly spoken to me; but now Cæsar hath sent to me, I am\r\nunder the necessity of being subservient to his decrees, because a\r\ndisobedience to them will bring upon me inevitable destruction.\" Then\r\nthe Jews replied, \"Since, therefore, thou art so disposed, O Petronius!\r\nthat thou wilt not disobey Caius's epistles, neither will we transgress\r\nthe commands of our law; and as we depend upon the excellency of our\r\nlaws, and, by the labors of our ancestors, have continued hitherto\r\nwithout suffering them to be transgressed, we dare not by any means\r\nsuffer ourselves to be so timorous as to transgress those laws out of\r\nthe fear of death, which God hath determined are for our advantage; and\r\nif we fall into misfortunes, we will bear them, in order to preserve our\r\nlaws, as knowing that those who expose themselves to dangers have good\r\nhope of escaping them, because God will stand on our side, when, out of\r\nregard to him, we undergo afflictions, and sustain the uncertain turns\r\nof fortune. But if we should submit to thee, we should be greatly\r\nreproached for our cowardice, as thereby showing ourselves ready to\r\ntransgress our law; and we should incur the great anger of God also,\r\nwho, even thyself being judge, is superior to Caius.\"\r\n\r\n3. When Petronius saw by their words that their determination was hard\r\nto be removed, and that, without a war, he should not be able to be\r\nsubservient to Caius in the dedication of his statue, and that there\r\nmust be a great deal of bloodshed, he took his friends, and the servants\r\nthat were about him, and hasted to Tiberias, as wanting to know in what\r\nposture the affairs of the Jews were; and many ten thousands of the Jews\r\nmet Petronius again, when he was come to Tiberias. These thought they\r\nmust run a mighty hazard if they should have a war with the Romans, but\r\njudged that the transgression of the law was of much greater\r\nconsequence, and made supplication to him, that he would by no means\r\nreduce them to such distresses, nor defile their city with the\r\ndedication of the statue. Then Petronius said to them, \"Will you then\r\nmake war with Cæsar, without considering his great preparations for war,\r\nand your own weakness?\" They replied, \"We will not by any means make war\r\nwith him, but still we will die before we see our laws transgressed.\" So\r\nthey threw themselves down upon their faces, and stretched out their\r\nthroats, and said they were ready to be slain; and this they did for\r\nforty days together, and in the mean time left off the tilling of their\r\nground, and that while the season of the year required them to sow it.\r\n31 Thus they continued firm in their resolution, and proposed to\r\nthemselves to die willingly, rather than to see the dedication of the\r\nstatue.\r\n\r\n4. When matters were in this state, Aristobulus, king Agrippa's brother,\r\nand Heleias the Great, and the other principal men of that family with\r\nthem, went in unto Petronius, and besought him, that since he saw the\r\nresolution of the multitude, he would not make any alteration, and\r\nthereby drive them to despair; but would write to Caius, that the Jews\r\nhad an insuperable aversion to the reception of the statue, and how they\r\ncontinued with him, and left off the tillage off their ground: that they\r\nwere not willing to go to war with him, because they were not able to do\r\nit, but were ready to die with pleasure, rather than suffer their laws\r\nto be transgressed: and how, upon the land's continuing unsown,\r\nrobberies would grow up, on the inability they would be under of paying\r\ntheir tributes; and that Caius might be thereby moved to pity, and not\r\norder any barbarous action to be done to them, nor think of destroying\r\nthe nation: that if he continues inflexible in his former opinion to\r\nbring a war upon them, he may then set about it himself. And thus did\r\nAristobulus, and the rest with him, supplicate Petronius. So Petronius,\r\n32 partly on account of the pressing instances which Aristobulus and the\r\nrest with him made, and because of the great consequence of what they\r\ndesired, and the earnestness wherewith they made their\r\nsupplication,—partly on account of the firmness of the opposition made\r\nby the Jews, which he saw, while he thought it a terrible thing for him\r\nto be such a slave to the madness of Caius, as to slay so many ten\r\nthousand men, only because of their religious disposition towards God,\r\nand after that to pass his life in expectation of punishment; Petronius,\r\nI say, thought it much better to send to Caius, and to let him know how\r\nintolerable it was to him to bear the anger he might have against him\r\nfor not serving him sooner, in obedience to his epistle, for that\r\nperhaps he might persuade him; and that if this mad resolution\r\ncontinued, he might then begin the war against them; nay, that in case\r\nhe should turn his hatred against himself, it was fit for virtuous\r\npersons even to die for the sake of such vast multitudes of men.\r\nAccordingly, he determined to hearken to the petitioners in this matter.\r\n\r\n5. He then called the Jews together to Tiberias, who came many ten\r\nthousands in number; he also placed that army he now had with him\r\nopposite to them; but did not discover his own meaning, but the commands\r\nof the emperor, and told them that his wrath would, without delay, be\r\nexecuted on such as had the courage to disobey what he had commanded,\r\nand this immediately; and that it was fit for him, who had obtained so\r\ngreat a dignity by his grant, not to contradict him in any thing:—\"yet,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I do not think it just to have such a regard to my own safety\r\nand honor, as to refuse to sacrifice them for your preservation, who are\r\nso many in number, and endeavor to preserve the regard that is due to\r\nyour law; which as it hath come down to you from your forefathers, so do\r\nyou esteem it worthy of your utmost contention to preserve it: nor, with\r\nthe supreme assistance and power of God, will I be so hardy as to suffer\r\nyour temple to fall into contempt by the means of the imperial\r\nauthority. I will, therefore, send to Caius, and let him know what your\r\nresolutions are, and will assist your suit as far as I am able, that you\r\nmay not be exposed to suffer on account of the honest designs you have\r\nproposed to yourselves; and may God be your assistant, for his authority\r\nis beyond all the contrivance and power of men; and may he procure you\r\nthe preservation of your ancient laws, and may not he be deprived,\r\nthough without your consent, of his accustomed honors. But if Caius be\r\nirritated, and turn the violence of his rage upon me, I will rather\r\nundergo all that danger and that affliction that may come either on my\r\nbody or my soul, than see so many of you to perish, while you are acting\r\nin so excellent a manner. Do you, therefore, every one of you, go your\r\nway about your own occupations, and fall to the cultivation of your\r\nground; I will myself send to Rome, and will not refuse to serve you in\r\nall things, both by myself and by my friends.\"\r\n\r\n6. When Petronius had said this, and had dismissed the assembly of the\r\nJews, he desired the principal of them to take care of their husbandry,\r\nand to speak kindly to the people, and encourage them to have good hope\r\nof their affairs. Thus did he readily bring the multitude to be cheerful\r\nagain. And now did God show his presence to Petronius, and signify to\r\nhim that he would afford him his assistance in his whole design; for he\r\nhad no sooner finished the speech that he made to the Jews, but God sent\r\ndown great showers of rain, contrary to human expectation; 33 for that\r\nday was a clear day, and gave no sign, by the appearance of the sky, of\r\nany rain; nay, the whole year had been subject to a great drought, and\r\nmade men despair of any water from above, even when at any time they saw\r\nthe heavens overcast with clouds; insomuch that when such a great\r\nquantity of rain came, and that in an unusual manner, and without any\r\nother expectation of it, the Jews hoped that Petronius would by no means\r\nfail in his petition for them. But as to Petronius, he was mightily\r\nsurprised when he perceived that God evidently took care of the Jews,\r\nand gave very plain signs of his appearance, and this to such a degree,\r\nthat those that were in earnest much inclined to the contrary had no\r\npower left to contradict it. This was also among those other particulars\r\nwhich he wrote to Caius, which all tended to dissuade him, and by all\r\nmeans to entreat him not to make so many ten thousands of these men go\r\ndistracted; whom, if he should slay, [for without war they would by no\r\nmeans suffer the laws of their worship to be set aside,] he would lose\r\nthe revenue they paid him, and would be publicly cursed by them for all\r\nfuture ages. Moreover, that God, who was their Governor, had shown his\r\npower most evidently on their account, and that such a power of his as\r\nleft no room for doubt about it. And this was the business that\r\nPetronius was now engaged in.\r\n\r\n7. But king Agrippa, who now lived at Rome, was more and more in the\r\nfavor of Caius; and when he had once made him a supper, and was careful\r\nto exceed all others, both in expenses and in such preparations as might\r\ncontribute most to his pleasure; nay, it was so far from the ability of\r\nothers, that Caius himself could never equal, much less exceed it [such\r\ncare had he taken beforehand to exceed all men, and particularly to make\r\nall agreeable to Cæsar]; hereupon Caius admired his understanding and\r\nmagnificence, that he should force himself to do all to please him, even\r\nbeyond such expenses as he could bear, and was desirous not to be behind\r\nAgrippa in that generosity which he exerted in order to please him. So\r\nCaius, when he had drank wine plentifully, and was merrier than\r\nordinary, said thus during the feast, when Agrippa had drunk to him: \"I\r\nknew before now how great a respect thou hast had for me, and how great\r\nkindness thou hast shown me, though with those hazards to thyself, which\r\nthou underwentest under Tiberius on that account; nor hast thou omitted\r\nany thing to show thy good-will towards us, even beyond thy ability;\r\nwhence it would be a base thing for me to be conquered by thy affection.\r\nI am therefore desirous to make thee amends for every thing in which I\r\nhave been formerly deficient; for all that I have bestowed on thee, that\r\nmay be called my gifts, is but little. Everything that may contribute to\r\nthy happiness shall be at thy service, and that cheerfully, and so far\r\nas my ability will reach.\" 34 And this was what Caius said to Agrippa,\r\nthinking he would ask for some large country, or the revenues of certain\r\ncities. But although he had prepared beforehand what he would ask, yet\r\nhad he not discovered his intentions, but made this answer to Caius\r\nimmediately: That it was not out of any expectation of gain that he\r\nformerly paid his respects to him, contrary to the commands of Tiberius,\r\nnor did he now do any thing relating to him out of regard to his own\r\nadvantage, and in order to receive any thing from him; that the gifts he\r\nhad already bestowed upon him were great, and beyond the hopes of even a\r\ncraving man; for although they may be beneath thy power, [who art the\r\ndonor,] yet are they greater than my inclination and dignity, who am the\r\nreceiver. And as Caius was astonished at Agrippa's inclinations, and\r\nstill the more pressed him to make his request for somewhat which he\r\nmight gratify him with, Agrippa replied, \"Since thou, O my lord!\r\ndeclarest such is thy readiness to grant, that I am worthy of thy gifts,\r\nI will ask nothing relating to my own felicity; for what thou hast\r\nalready bestowed on me has made me excel therein; but I desire somewhat\r\nwhich may make thee glorious for piety, and render the Divinity\r\nassistant to thy designs, and may be for an honor to me among those that\r\ninquire about it, as showing that I never once fail of obtaining what I\r\ndesire of thee; for my petition is this, that thou wilt no longer think\r\nof the dedication of that statue which thou hast ordered to be set up in\r\nthe Jewish temple by Petronius.\"\r\n\r\n8. And thus did Agrippa venture to cast the die upon this occasion, so\r\ngreat was the affair in his opinion, and in reality, though he knew how\r\ndangerous a thing it was so to speak; for had not Caius approved of it,\r\nit had tended to no less than the loss of his life. So Caius, who was\r\nmightily taken with Agrippa's obliging behavior, and on other accounts\r\nthinking it a dishonorable thing to be guilty of falsehood before so\r\nmany witnesses, in points wherein he had with such alacrity forced\r\nAgrippa to become a petitioner, and that it would look as if he had\r\nalready repented of what he had said, and because he greatly admired\r\nAgrippa's virtue, in not desiring him at all to augment his own\r\ndominions, either with larger revenues, or other authority, but took\r\ncare of the public tranquillity, of the laws, and of the Divinity\r\nitself, he granted him what he had requested. He also wrote thus to\r\nPetronius, commending him for his assembling his army, and then\r\nconsulting him about these affairs. \"If therefore,\" said' he, \"thou hast\r\nalready erected my statue, let it stand; but if thou hast not yet\r\ndedicated it, do not trouble thyself further about it, but dismiss thy\r\narmy, go back, and take care of those affairs which I sent thee about at\r\nfirst, for I have now no occasion for the erection of that statue. This\r\nI have granted as a favor to Agrippa, a man whom I honor so very\r\ngreatly, that I am not able to contradict what he would have, or what he\r\ndesired me to do for him.\" And this was what Caius wrote to Petronius,\r\nwhich was before he received his letter, informing him that the Jews\r\nwere very ready to revolt about the statue, and that they seemed\r\nresolved to threaten war against the Romans, and nothing else. When\r\ntherefore Caius was much displeased that any attempt should be made\r\nagainst his government as he was a slave to base and vicious actions on\r\nall occasions, and had no regard to what was virtuous and honorable, and\r\nagainst whomsoever he resolved to show his anger, and that for any cause\r\nwhatsoever, he suffered not himself to be restrained by any admonition,\r\nbut thought the indulging his anger to be a real pleasure, he wrote thus\r\nto Petronius: \"Seeing thou esteemest the presents made thee by the Jews\r\nto be of greater value than my commands, and art grown insolent enough\r\nto be subservient to their pleasure, I charge thee to become thy own\r\njudge, and to consider what thou art to do, now thou art under my\r\ndispleasure; for I will make thee an example to the present and to all\r\nfuture ages, that they may not dare to contradict the commands of their\r\nemperor.\"\r\n\r\n9. This was the epistle which Caius wrote to Petronius; but Petronius\r\ndid not receive it while Caius was alive, that ship which carried it\r\nsailing so slow, that other letters came to Petronius before this, by\r\nwhich he understood that Caius was dead; for God would not forget the\r\ndangers Petronius had undertaken on account of the Jews, and of his own\r\nhonor. But when he had taken Caius away, out of his indignation of what\r\nhe had so insolently attempted in assuming to himself divine worship,\r\nboth Rome and all that dominion conspired with Petronius, especially\r\nthose that were of the senatorian order, to give Caius his due reward,\r\nbecause he had been unmercifully severe to them; for he died not long\r\nafter he had written to Petronius that epistle which threatened him with\r\ndeath. But as for the occasion of his death, and the nature of the plot\r\nagainst him, I shall relate them in the progress of this narration. Now\r\nthat epistle which informed Petronius of Caius's death came first, and a\r\nlittle afterward came that which commanded him to kill himself with his\r\nown hands. Whereupon he rejoiced at this coincidence as to the death of\r\nCaius, and admired God's providence, who, without the least delay, and\r\nimmediately, gave him a reward for the regard he had to the temple, and\r\nthe assistance he afforded the Jews for avoiding the dangers they were\r\nin. And by this means Petronius escaped that danger of death, which he\r\ncould not foresee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. What Befell The Jews That Were In Babylon On Occasion Of\r\nAsineus And Anileus, Two Brethren.\r\n\r\n1. A Very sad calamity now befell the Jews that were in Mesopotamia, and\r\nespecially those that dwelt in Babylonia. Inferior it was to none of the\r\ncalamities which had gone before, and came together with a great\r\nslaughter of them, and that greater than any upon record before;\r\nconcerning all which I shall speak accurately, and shall explain the\r\noccasions whence these miseries came upon them. There was a city of\r\nBabylonia called Neerda; not only a very populous one, but one that had\r\na good and a large territory about it, and, besides its other\r\nadvantages, full of men also. It was, besides, not easily to be\r\nassaulted by enemies, from the river Euphrates encompassing it all\r\nround, and from the wails that were built about it. There was also the\r\ncity Nisibis, situate on the same current of the river. For which reason\r\nthe Jews, depending on the natural strength of these places, deposited\r\nin them that half shekel which every one, by the custom of our country,\r\noffers unto God, as well as they did other things devoted to him; for\r\nthey made use of these cities as a treasury, whence, at a proper time,\r\nthey were transmitted to Jerusalem; and many ten thousand men undertook\r\nthe carriage of those donations, out of fear of the ravages of the\r\nParthians, to whom the Babylonians were then subject. Now there were two\r\nmen, Asineus and Anileus, of the city Neerda by birth, and brethren to\r\none another. They were destitute of a father, and their mother put them\r\nto learn the art of weaving curtains, it not being esteemed disgrace\r\namong them for men to be weavers of cloth. Now he that taught them that\r\nart, and was set over them, complained that they came too late to their\r\nwork, and punished them with stripes; but they took this just punishment\r\nas an affront, and carried off all the weapons which were kept in that\r\nhouse, which were not a few, and went into a certain place where was a\r\npartition of the rivers, and was a place naturally very fit for the\r\nfeeding of cattle, and for preserving such fruits as were usually laid\r\nup against winter. The poorest sort of the young men also resorted to\r\nthem, whom they armed with the weapons they had gotten, and became their\r\ncaptains; and nothing hindered them from being their leaders into\r\nmischief; for as soon as they were become invincible, and had built them\r\na citadel, they sent to such as fed cattle, and ordered them to pay them\r\nso much tribute out of them as might be sufficient for their\r\nmaintenance, proposing also that they would be their friends, if they\r\nwould submit to them, and that they would defend them from all their\r\nother enemies on every side, but that they would kill the cattle of\r\nthose that refused to obey them. So they hearkened to their proposals,\r\n[for they could do nothing else,] and sent them as many sheep as were\r\nrequired of them; whereby their forces grew greater, and they became\r\nlords over all they pleased, because they marched suddenly, and did them\r\na mischief, insomuch that every body who had to do with them chose to\r\npay them respect; and they became formidable to such as came to assault\r\nthem, till the report about them came to the ears of the king of Parthia\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n2. But when the governor of Babylonia understood this, and had a mind to\r\nput a stop to them before they grew greater, and before greater\r\nmischiefs should arise from them, he got together as great an army as he\r\ncould, both of Parthians and Babylonians, and marched against them,\r\nthinking to attack them and destroy them before any one should carry\r\nthem the news that he had got an army together. He then encamped at a\r\nlake, and lay still; but on the next day [it was the sabbath, which is\r\namong the Jews a day of rest from all sorts of work] he supposed that\r\nthe enemy would not dare to fight him thereon, but that he would take\r\nthem and carry them away prisoners, without fighting. He therefore\r\nproceeded gradually, and thought to fall upon them on the sudden. Now\r\nAsineus was sitting with the rest, and their weapons lay by them; upon\r\nwhich he said, \"Sirs, I hear a neighing of horses; not of such as are\r\nfeeding, but such as have men on their backs; I also hear such a noise\r\nof their bridles, that I am afraid that some enemies are coming upon us\r\nto encompass us round. However, let somebody go to look about, and make\r\nreport of what reality there is in the present state of things; and may\r\nwhat I have said prove a false alarm.\" And when he had said this, some\r\nof them went out to spy out what was the matter; and they came again\r\nimmediately, and said to him, that \"neither hast thou been mistaken in\r\ntelling us what our enemies were doing, nor will those enemies permit us\r\nto be injurious to people any longer. We are caught by their intrigues\r\nlike brute beasts, and there is a large body of cavalry marching upon\r\nus, while we are destitute of hands to defend ourselves withal, because\r\nwe are restrained from doing it by the prohibition of our law, which\r\nobliges us to rest [on this day].\" But Asineus did not by any means\r\nagree with the opinion of his spy as to what was to be done, but thought\r\nit more agreeable to the law to pluck up their spirits in this necessity\r\nthey were fallen into, and break their law by avenging themselves,\r\nalthough they should die in the action, than by doing nothing to please\r\ntheir enemies in submitting to be slain by them. Accordingly, he took up\r\nhis weapons, and infused courage into those that were with him to act as\r\ncourageously as himself. So they fell upon their enemies, and slew a\r\ngreat many of them, because they despised them and came as to a certain\r\nvictory, and put the rest to flight.\r\n\r\n3. But when the news of this fight came to the king of Parthia, he was\r\nsurprised at the boldness of these brethren, and was desirous to see\r\nthem, and speak with them. He therefore sent the most trusty of all his\r\nguards to say thus to them: \"That king Artabanus, although he had been\r\nunjustly treated by you, who have made an attempt against his\r\ngovernment, yet hath he more regard to your courageous behavior, than to\r\nthe anger he bears to you, and hath sent me to give you his right hand\r\n35 and security; and he permits you to come to him safely, and without\r\nany violence upon the road; and he wants to have you address yourselves\r\nto him as friends, without meaning any guile or deceit to you. He also\r\npromises to make you presents, and to pay you those respects which will\r\nmake an addition of his power to your courage, and thereby be of\r\nadvantage to you.\" Yet did Asineus himself put off his journey thither,\r\nbut sent his brother Anileus with all such presents as he could procure.\r\nSo he went, and was admitted to the king's presence; and when Artabanus\r\nsaw Anileus coming alone, he inquired into the reason why Asineus\r\navoided to come along with him; and when he understood that he was\r\nafraid, and staid by the lake, he took an oath, by the gods of his\r\ncountry, that he would do them no harm, if they came to him upon the\r\nassurances he gave them, and gave him his right hand. This is of the\r\ngreatest force there with all these barbarians, and affords a firm\r\nsecurity to those who converse with them; for none of them will deceive\r\nyou when once they have given you their right hands, nor will any one\r\ndoubt of their fidelity, when that is once given, even though they were\r\nbefore suspected of injustice. When Artabanus had done this, he sent\r\naway Anileus to persuade his brother to come to him. Now this the king\r\ndid, because he wanted to curb his own governors of provinces by the\r\ncourage of these Jewish brethren, lest they should make a league with\r\nthem; for they were ready for a revolt, and were disposed to rebel, had\r\nthey been sent on an expedition against them. He was also afraid, lest\r\nwhen he was engaged in a war, in order to subdue those governors of\r\nprovinces that had revolted, the party of Asineus, and those in\r\nBabylonia, should be augmented, and either make war upon him, when they\r\nshould hear of that revolt, or if they should be disappointed in that\r\ncase, they would not fail of doing further mischief to him.\r\n\r\n4. When the king had these intentions, he sent away Anileus, and Anileus\r\nprevailed on his brother [to come to the king], when he had related to\r\nhim the king's good-will, and the oath that he had taken. Accordingly,\r\nthey made haste to go to Artabanus, who received them when they were\r\ncome with pleasure, and admired Asineus's courage in the actions he had\r\ndone, and this because he was a little man to see to, and at first sight\r\nappeared contemptible also, and such as one might deem a person of no\r\nvalue at all. He also said to his friends, how, upon the comparison, he\r\nshowed his soul to be in all respects superior to his body; and when, as\r\nthey were drinking together, he once showed Asineus to Abdagases, one of\r\nthe generals of his army, and told him his name, and described the great\r\ncourage he was of in war, and Abdagases had desired leave to kill him,\r\nand thereby to inflict on him a punishment for those injuries he had\r\ndone to the Parthian government, the king replied, \"I will never give\r\nthee leave to kill a man who hath depended on my faith, especially not\r\nafter I have sent him my right hand, and endeavored to gain his belief\r\nby oaths made by the gods. But if thou be a truly warlike man, thou\r\nstandest not in need of my perjury. Go thou then, and avenge the\r\nParthian government; attack this man, when he is returned back, and\r\nconquer him by the forces that are under thy command, without my\r\nprivity.\" Hereupon the king called for Asineus, and said to him, \"It is\r\ntime for thee, O thou young man! to return home, and not provoke the\r\nindignation of my generals in this place any further, lest they attempt\r\nto murder thee, and that without my approbation. I commit to thee the\r\ncountry of Babylonia in trust, that it may, by thy care, be preserved\r\nfree from robbers, and from other mischiefs. I have kept my faith\r\ninviolable to thee, and that not in trifling affairs, but in those that\r\nconcerned thy safety, and do therefore deserve thou shouldst be kind to\r\nme.\" When he had said this, and given Asineus some presents, he sent him\r\naway immediately; who, when he was come home, built fortresses, and\r\nbecame great in a little time, and managed things with such courage and\r\nsuccess, as no other person, that had no higher a beginning, ever did\r\nbefore him. Those Parthian governors also, who were sent that way, paid\r\nhim great respect; and the honor that was paid him by the Babylonians\r\nseemed to them too small, and beneath his deserts, although he were in\r\nno small dignity and power there; nay, indeed, all the affairs of\r\nMesopotamia depended upon him, and he more and more flourished in this\r\nhappy condition of his for fifteen years.\r\n\r\n5. But as their affairs were in so flourishing a state, there sprang up\r\na calamity among them on the following occasion. When once they had\r\ndeviated from that course of virtue whereby they had gained so great\r\npower, they affronted and transgressed the laws of their forefathers,\r\nand fell under the dominion of their lusts and pleasures. A certain\r\nParthian, who came as general of an army into those parts, had a wife\r\nfollowing him, who had a vast reputation for other accomplishments, and\r\nparticularly was admired above all other women for her beauty. Anileus,\r\nthe brother of Asineus, either heard of that her beauty from others, or\r\nperhaps saw her himself also, and so became at once her lover and her\r\nenemy; partly because he could not hope to enjoy this woman but by\r\nobtaining power over her as a captive, and partly because he thought he\r\ncould not conquer his inclinations for her. As soon therefore as her\r\nhusband had been declared an enemy to them, and was fallen in the\r\nbattle, the widow of the deceased was married to this her lover.\r\nHowever, this woman did not come into their house without producing\r\ngreat misfortunes, both to Anileus himself, and to Asineus also; but\r\nbrought great mischiefs upon them on the occasion following. Since she\r\nwas led away captive, upon the death of her husband, she concealed the\r\nimages of those gods which were their country gods, common to her\r\nhusband and to herself: now it was the custom 36 of that country for all\r\nto have the idols they worship in their own houses, and to carry them\r\nalong with them when they go into a foreign land; agreeable to which\r\ncustom of theirs she carried her idols with her. Now at first she\r\nperformed her worship to them privately; but when she was become\r\nAnileus's married wife, she worshipped them in her accustomed manner,\r\nand with the same appointed ceremonies which she used in her former\r\nhusband's days; upon which their most esteemed friends blamed him at\r\nfirst, that he did not act after the manner of the Hebrews, nor perform\r\nwhat was agreeable to their laws, in marrying a foreign wife, and one\r\nthat transgressed the accurate appointments of their sacrifices and\r\nreligious ceremonies; that he ought to consider, lest, by allowing\r\nhimself in many pleasures of the body, he might lose his principality,\r\non account of the beauty of a wife, and that high authority which, by\r\nGod's blessing, he had arrived at. But when they prevailed not at all\r\nupon him, he slew one of them for whom he had the greatest respect,\r\nbecause of the liberty he took with him; who, when he was dying, out of\r\nregard to the laws, imprecated a punishment upon his murderer Anileus,\r\nand upon Asineus also, and that all their companions might come to a\r\nlike end from their enemies; upon the two first as the principal actors\r\nof this wickedness, and upon the rest as those that would not assist him\r\nwhen he suffered in the defense of their laws. Now these latter were\r\nsorely grieved, yet did they tolerate these doings, because they\r\nremembered that they had arrived at their present happy state by no\r\nother means than their fortitude. But when they also heard of the\r\nworship of those gods whom the Parthians adore, they thought the injury\r\nthat Anileus offered to their laws was to be borne no longer; and a\r\ngreater number of them came to Asineus, and loudly complained of\r\nAnileus, and told him that it had been well that he had of himself seen\r\nwhat was advantageous to them; but that however it was now high time to\r\ncorrect what had been done amiss, before the crime that had been\r\ncommitted proved the ruin of himself and all the rest of them. They\r\nadded, that the marriage of this woman was made without their consent,\r\nand without a regard to their old laws; and that the worship which this\r\nwoman paid [to her gods] was a reproach to the God whom they worshipped.\r\nNow Asineus was sensible of his brother's offense, that it had been\r\nalready the cause of great mischiefs, and would be so for the time to\r\ncome; yet did he tolerate the same from the good-will he had to so near\r\na relation, and forgiving it to him, on account that his brother was\r\nquite overborne by his wicked inclinations. But as more and more still\r\ncame about him every day, and the clamors about it became greater, he at\r\nlength spake to Anileus about these clamors, reproving him for his\r\nformer actions, and desiring him for the future to leave them off, and\r\nsend the woman back to her relations. But nothing was gained by these\r\nreproofs; for as the woman perceived what a tumult was made among the\r\npeople on her account, and was afraid for Anileus, lest he should come\r\nto any harm for his love to her, she infused poison into Asineus's food,\r\nand thereby took him off, and was now secure of prevailing, when her\r\nlover was to be judge of what should be done about her.\r\n\r\n6. So Anileus took the government upon himself alone, and led his army\r\nagainst the villages of Mithridates, who was a man of principal\r\nauthority in Parthia, and had married king Artabanus's daughter; he also\r\nplundered them, and among that prey was found much money, and many\r\nslaves, as also a great number of sheep, and many other things, which,\r\nwhen gained, make men's condition happy. Now when Mithridates, who was\r\nthere at this time, heard that his villages were taken, he was very much\r\ndispleased to find that Anileus had first begun to injure him, and to\r\naffront him in his present dignity, when he had not offered any injury\r\nto him beforehand; and he got together the greatest body of horsemen he\r\nwas able, and those out of that number which were of an age fit for war,\r\nand came to fight Anileus; and when he was arrived at a certain village\r\nof his own, he lay still there, as intending to fight him on the day\r\nfollowing, because it was the sabbath, the day on which the Jews rest.\r\nAnd when Anileus was informed of this by a Syrian stranger of another\r\nvillage, who not only gave him an exact account of other circumstances,\r\nbut told him where Mithridates would have a feast, he took his supper at\r\na proper time, and marched by night, with an intent of falling upon the\r\nParthians while they were unapprised what they should do; so he fell\r\nupon them about the fourth watch of the night, and some of them he slew\r\nwhile they were asleep, and others he put to flight, and took\r\nMithridates alive, and set him naked upon an ass 37 which, among the\r\nParthians, is esteemed the greatest reproach possible. And when he had\r\nbrought him into a wood with such a resolution, and his friends desired\r\nhim to kill Mithridates, he soon told them his own mind to the contrary,\r\nand said that it was not right to kill a man who was of one of the\r\nprincipal families among the Parthians, and greatly honored with\r\nmatching into the royal family; that so far as they had hitherto gone\r\nwas tolerable; for although they had injured Mithridates, yet if they\r\npreserved his life, this benefit would be remembered by him to the\r\nadvantage of those that gave it him; but that if he were once put to\r\ndeath, the king would not be at rest till he had made a great slaughter\r\nof the Jews that dwelt at Babylon; \"to whose safety we ought to have a\r\nregard, both on account of our relation to them, and because if any\r\nmisfortune befall us, we have no other place to retire to, since he hath\r\ngotten the flower of their youth under him.\" By this thought, and this\r\nspeech of his made in council, he persuaded them to act accordingly; so\r\nMithridates was let go. But when he was got away, his wife reproached\r\nhim, that although he was son-in-law to the king, he neglected to avenge\r\nhimself on those that had injured him, while he took no care about it,\r\nbut was contented to have been made a captive by the Jews, and to have\r\nescaped them; and she bid him either to go back like a man of courage,\r\nor else she sware by the gods of their royal family that she would\r\ncertainly dissolve her marriage with him. Upon which, partly because he\r\ncould not bear the daily trouble of her taunts, and partly because he\r\nwas afraid of her insolence, lest she should in earnest dissolve their\r\nmarriage, he unwillingly, and against his inclinations, got together\r\nagain as great an army as he could, and marched along with them, as\r\nhimself thinking it a thing not to be borne any longer, that he, a\r\nParthian, should owe his preservation to the Jews, when they had been\r\ntoo hard for him in the war.\r\n\r\n7. But as soon as Anileus understood that Mithridates was marching with\r\na great army against him, he thought it too ignominious a thing to tarry\r\nabout the lakes, and not to take the first opportunity of meeting his\r\nenemies, and he hoped to have the same success, and to beat their\r\nenemies as they did before; as also he ventured boldly upon the like\r\nattempts. Accordingly, he led out his army, and a great many more joined\r\nthemselves to that army, in order to betake themselves to plunder the\r\npeople, and in order to terrify the enemy again by their numbers. But\r\nwhen they had marched ninety furlongs, while the road had been through\r\ndry [and sandy] places, and about the midst of the day, they were become\r\nvery thirsty; and Mithridates appeared, and fell upon them, as they were\r\nin distress for want of water, on which account, and on account of the\r\ntime of the day, they were not able to bear their weapons. So Anileus\r\nand his men were put to an ignominious rout, while men in despair were\r\nto attack those that were fresh and in good plight; so a great slaughter\r\nwas made, and many ten thousand men fell. Now Anileus, and all that\r\nstood firm about him, ran away as fast as they were able into a wood,\r\nand afforded Mithridates the pleasure of having gained a great victory\r\nover them. But there now came in to Anileus a conflux of bad men, who\r\nregarded their own lives very little, if they might but gain some\r\npresent ease, insomuch that they, by thus coming to him, compensated the\r\nmultitude of those that perished in the fight. Yet were not these men\r\nlike to those that fell, because they were rash, and unexercised in war;\r\nhowever, with these he came upon the villages of the Babylonians, and a\r\nmighty devastation of all things was made there by the injuries that\r\nAnileus did them. So the Babylonians, and those that had already been in\r\nthe war, sent to Neerda to the Jews there, and demanded Anileus. But\r\nalthough they did not agree to their demands, [for if they had been\r\nwilling to deliver him up, it was not in their power so to do,] yet did\r\nthey desire to make peace with them. To which the other replied, that\r\nthey also wanted to settle conditions of peace with them, and sent men\r\ntogether with the Babylonians, who discoursed with Anileus about them.\r\nBut the Babylonians, upon taking a view of his situation, and having\r\nlearned where Anileus and his men lay, fell secretly upon them as they\r\nwere drunk and fallen asleep, and slew all that they caught of them,\r\nwithout any fear, and killed Anileus himself also.\r\n\r\n8. The Babylonians were now freed from Anileus's heavy incursions, which\r\nhad been a great restraint to the effects of that hatred they bore to\r\nthe Jews; for they were almost always at variance, by reason of the\r\ncontrariety of their laws; and which party soever grew boldest before\r\nthe other, they assaulted the other: and at this time in particular it\r\nwas, that upon the ruin of Anileus's party, the Babylonians attacked the\r\nJews, which made those Jews so vehemently to resent the injuries they\r\nreceived from the Babylonians, that being neither able to fight them,\r\nnor bearing to live with them, they went to Seleucia, the principal city\r\nof those parts, which was built by Seleucus Nicator. It was inhabited by\r\nmany of the Macedonians, but by more of the Grecians; not a few of the\r\nSyrians also dwelt there; and thither did the Jews fly, and lived there\r\nfive years, without any misfortunes. But on the sixth year, a pestilence\r\ncame upon these at Babylon, which occasioned new removals of men's\r\nhabitations out of that city; and because they came to Seleucia, it\r\nhappened that a still heavier calamity came upon them on that account\r\nwhich I am going to relate immediately.\r\n\r\n9. Now the way of living of the people of Seleucia, which were Greeks\r\nand Syrians, was commonly quarrelsome, and full of discords, though the\r\nGreeks were too hard for the Syrians. When, therefore, the Jews were\r\ncome thither, and dwelt among them, there arose a sedition, and the\r\nSyrians were too hard for the other, by the assistance of the Jews, who\r\nare men that despise dangers, and very ready to fight upon any occasion.\r\nNow when the Greeks had the worst in this sedition, and saw that they\r\nhad but one way of recovering their former authority, and that was, if\r\nthey could prevent the agreement between the Jews and the Syrians, they\r\nevery one discoursed with such of the Syrians as were formerly their\r\nacquaintance, and promised they would be at peace and friendship with\r\nthem. Accordingly, they gladly agreed so to do; and when this was done\r\nby the principal men of both nations, they soon agreed to a\r\nreconciliation; and when they were so agreed, they both knew that the\r\ngreat design of such their union would be their common hatred to the\r\nJews. Accordingly, they fell upon them, and slew about fifty thousand of\r\nthem; nay, the Jews were all destroyed, excepting a few who escaped,\r\neither by the compassion which their friends or neighbors afforded them,\r\nin order to let them fly away. These retired to Ctesiphon, a Grecian\r\ncity, and situate near to Seleucia, where the king [of Parthia] lives in\r\nwinter every year, and where the greatest part of his riches are\r\nreposited; but the Jews had here no certain settlement, those of\r\nSeleucia having little concern for the king's honor. Now the whole\r\nnation of the Jews were in fear both of the Babylonians and of the\r\nSeleucians, because all the Syrians that live in those places agreed\r\nwith the Seleucians in the war against the Jews; so the most of them\r\ngathered themselves together, and went to Neerda and Nisibis, and\r\nobtained security there by the strength of those cities; besides which\r\ntheir inhabitants, who were a great many, were all warlike men. And this\r\nwas the state of the Jews at this time in Babylonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Since St. Luke once, Acts 5:37, and Josephus four several\r\ntimes, once here, sect. 6; and B.

Containing The Interval Of Three Years And A Half.—From The\r\nDeparture Out Of Babylon To Fadus, The Roman Procurator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. How Caius 1 Was Slain By Cherea.\r\n\r\n1. Now this Caius 2 did not demonstrate his madness in offering injuries\r\nonly to the Jews at Jerusalem, or to those that dwelt in the\r\nneighborhood; but suffered it to extend itself through all the earth and\r\nsea, so far as was in subjection to the Romans, and filled it with ten\r\nthousand mischiefs; so many indeed in number as no former history\r\nrelates. But Rome itself felt the most dismal effects of what he did,\r\nwhile he deemed that not to be any way more honorable than the rest of\r\nthe cities; but he pulled and hauled its other citizens, but especially\r\nthe senate, and particularly the nobility, and such as had been\r\ndignified by illustrious ancestors; he also had ten thousand devices\r\nagainst such of the equestrian order, as it was styled, who were\r\nesteemed by the citizens equal in dignity and wealth with the senators,\r\nbecause out of them the senators were themselves chosen; these he\r\ntreated after all ignominious manner, and removed them out of his way,\r\nwhile they were at once slain, and their wealth plundered, because he\r\nslew men generally in order to seize on their riches. He also asserted\r\nhis own divinity, and insisted on greater honors to be paid him by his\r\nsubjects than are due to mankind. He also frequented that temple of\r\nJupiter which they style the Capitol, which is with them the most holy\r\nof all their temples, and had boldness enough to call himself the\r\nbrother of Jupiter. And other pranks he did like a madman; as when he\r\nlaid a bridge from the city Dicearchia, which belongs to Campania, to\r\nMisenum, another city upon the sea-side, from one promontory to another,\r\nof the length of thirty furlongs, as measured over the sea. And this was\r\ndone because he esteemed it to be a most tedious thing to row over it in\r\na small ship, and thought withal that it became him to make that bridge,\r\nsince he was lord of the sea, and might oblige it to give marks of\r\nobedience as well as the earth; so he enclosed the whole bay within his\r\nbridge, and drove his chariot over it; and thought that, as he was a\r\ngod, it was fit for him to travel over such roads as this was. Nor did\r\nhe abstain from the plunder of any of the Grecian temples, and gave\r\norder that all the engravings and sculptures, and the rest of the\r\nornaments of the statues and donations therein dedicated, should be\r\nbrought to him, saying that the best things ought to be set no where but\r\nin the best place, and that the city of Rome was that best place. He\r\nalso adorned his own house and his gardens with the curiosities brought\r\nfrom those temples, together with the houses he lay at when he traveled\r\nall over Italy; whence he did not scruple to give a command that the\r\nstatue of Jupiter Olympius, so called because he was honored at the\r\nOlympian games by the Greeks, which was the work of Phidias the\r\nAthenian, should be brought to Rome. Yet did not he compass his end,\r\nbecause the architects told Memmius Regulus, who was commanded to remove\r\nthat statue of Jupiter, that the workmanship was such as would be\r\nspoiled, and would not bear the removal. It was also reported that\r\nMemmius, both on that account, and on account of some such mighty\r\nprodigies as are of an incredible nature, put off the taking it down,\r\nand wrote to Caius those accounts, as his apology for not having done\r\nwhat his epistle required of him; and that when he was thence in danger\r\nof perishing, he was saved by Caius being dead himself, before he had\r\nput him to death.\r\n\r\n2. Nay, Caius's madness came to this height, that when he had a daughter\r\nborn, he carried her into the capitol, and put her upon the knees of the\r\nstatue, and said that the child was common to him and to Jupiter, and\r\ndetermined that she had two fathers, but which of these fathers were the\r\ngreatest he left undetermined; and yet mankind bore him in such his\r\npranks. He also gave leave to slaves to accuse their masters of any\r\ncrimes whatsoever they pleased; for all such accusations were terrible,\r\nbecause they were in great part made to please him, and at his\r\nsuggestion, insomuch that Pollux, Claudius's slave, had the boldness to\r\nlay an accusation against Claudius himself; and Caius was not ashamed to\r\nbe present at his trial of life and death, to hear that trial of his own\r\nuncle, in hopes of being able to take him off, although he did not\r\nsucceed to his mind. But when he had filled the whole habitable world\r\nwhich he governed with false accusations and miseries, and had\r\noccasioned the greatest insults of slaves against their masters, who\r\nindeed in a great measure ruled them, there were many secret plots now\r\nlaid against him; some in anger, and in order for men to revenge\r\nthemselves, on account of the miseries they had already undergone from\r\nhim; and others made attempts upon him, in order to take him off before\r\nthey should fall into such great miseries, while his death came very\r\nfortunately for the preservation of the laws of all men, and had a great\r\ninfluence upon the public welfare; and this happened most happily for\r\nour nation in particular, which had almost utterly perished if he had\r\nnot been suddenly slain. And I confess I have a mind to give a full\r\naccount of this matter particularly, because it will afford great\r\nassurance of the power of God, and great comfort to those that are under\r\nafflictions, and wise caution to those who think their happiness will\r\nnever end, nor bring them at length to the most lasting miseries, if\r\nthey do not conduct their lives by the principles of virtue.\r\n\r\n3. Now there were three several conspiracies made in order to take off\r\nCaius, and each of these three were conducted by excellent persons.\r\nEmilius Regulus, born at Corduba in Spain, got some men together, and\r\nwas desirous to take Caius off, either by them or by himself. Another\r\nconspiracy there was laid by them, under the conduct of Cherea Cassius,\r\nthe tribune [of the Pretorian band]. Minucianus Annins was also one of\r\ngreat consequence among those that were prepared to oppose his tyranny.\r\nNow the several occasions of these men's several hatred and conspiracy\r\nagainst Caius were these: Regulus had indignation and hatred against all\r\ninjustice, for he had a mind naturally angry, and bold, and free, which\r\nmade him not conceal his counsels; so he communicated them to many of\r\nhis friends, and to others who seemed to him persons of activity and\r\nvigor: Minucianus entered into this conspiracy, because of the injustice\r\ndone to Lepidus his particular friend, and one of the best character of\r\nall the citizens, whom Caius had slain, as also because he was afraid of\r\nhimself, since Caius's wrath tended to the slaughter of all alike: and\r\nfor Cherea, he came in, because he thought it a deed worthy of a free\r\ningenuous man to kill Caius, and was ashamed of the reproaches he lay\r\nunder from Caius, as though he were a coward; as also because he was\r\nhimself in danger every day from his friendship with him, and the\r\nobservance he paid him. These men proposed this attempt to all the rest\r\nthat were concerned, who saw the injuries that were offered them, and\r\nwere desirous that Caius's slaughter might succeed by their mutual\r\nassistance of one another, and they might themselves escape being killed\r\nby the taking off Caius; that perhaps they should gain their point; and\r\nthat it would be a happy thing, if they should gain it, to approve\r\nthemselves to so many excellent persons, as earnestly wished to be\r\npartakers with them in their design for the delivery of the city and of\r\nthe government, even at the hazard of their own lives. But still Cherea\r\nwas the most zealous of them all, both out of a desire of getting\r\nhimself the greatest name, and also by reason of his access to Caius's\r\npresence with less danger, because he was tribune, and could therefore\r\nthe more easily kill him.\r\n\r\n4. Now at this time came on the horse-races [Circensian games]; the view\r\nof which games was eagerly desired by the people of Rome, for they come\r\nwith great alacrity into the hippodrome [circus] at such times, and\r\npetition their emperors, in great multitudes, for what they stand in\r\nneed of; who usually did not think fit to deny them their requests, but\r\nreadily and gratefully granted them. Accordingly, they most\r\nimportunately desired that Caius would now ease them in their tributes,\r\nand abate somewhat of the rigor of their taxes imposed upon them; but he\r\nwould not hear their petition; and when their clamors increased, he sent\r\nsoldiers some one way and some another, and gave order that they should\r\nlay hold on those that made the clamors, and without any more ado bring\r\nthem out, and put them to death. These were Caius's commands, and those\r\nwho were commanded executed the same; and the number of those who were\r\nslain on this occasion was very great. Now the people saw this, and bore\r\nit so far, that they left off clamoring, because they saw with their own\r\neyes that this petition to be relieved, as to the payment of their\r\nmoney, brought immediate death upon them. These things made Cherea more\r\nresolute to go on with his plot, in order to put an end to this\r\nbarbarity of Caius against men. He then at several times thought to fall\r\nupon Caius, even as he was feasting; yet did he restrain himself by some\r\nconsiderations; not that he had any doubt on him about killing him, but\r\nas watching for a proper season, that the attempt might not be\r\nfrustrated, but that he might give the blow so as might certainly gain\r\nhis purpose.\r\n\r\n5. Cherea had been in the army a long time, yet was he not pleased with\r\nconversing so much with Caius. But Caius had set him to require the\r\ntributes, and other dues, which, when not paid in due time, were\r\nforfeited to Cæsar's treasury; and he had made some delays in requiring\r\nthem, because those burdens had been doubled, and had rather indulged\r\nhis own mild disposition than performed Caius's command; nay, indeed, he\r\nprovoked Caius to anger by his sparing men, and pitying the hard\r\nfortunes of those from whom he demanded the taxes; and Caius upbraided\r\nhim with his sloth and effeminacy in being so long about collecting the\r\ntaxes. And indeed he did not only affront him in other respects, but\r\nwhen he gave him the watchword of the day, to whom it was to be given by\r\nhis place, he gave him feminine words, and those of a nature very\r\nreproachful; and these watchwords he gave out, as having been initiated\r\nin the secrets of certain mysteries, which he had been himself the\r\nauthor of. Now although he had sometimes put on women's clothes, and had\r\nbeen wrapt in some embroidered garments to them belonging, and done a\r\ngreat many other things, in order to make the company mistake him for a\r\nwoman; yet did he, by way of reproach, object the like womanish behavior\r\nto Cherea. But when Cherea received the watchword from him, he had\r\nindignation at it, but had greater indignation at the delivery of it to\r\nothers, as being laughed at by those that received it; insomuch that his\r\nfellow tribunes made him the subject of their drollery; for they would\r\nforetell that he would bring them some of his usual watchwords when he\r\nwas about to take the watchword from Cæsar, and would thereby make him\r\nridiculous; on which accounts he took the courage of assuming certain\r\npartners to him, as having just reasons for his indignation against\r\nCaius. Now there was one Pompedius, a senator, and one who had gone\r\nthrough almost all posts in the government, but otherwise an Epicurean,\r\nand for that reason loved to lead an inactive life. Now Timidius, an\r\nenemy of his, had informed Caius that he had used indecent reproaches\r\nagainst him, and he made use of Quintilia for a witness to them; a woman\r\nshe was much beloved by many that frequented the theater, and\r\nparticularly by Pompedius, on account of her great beauty. Now this\r\nwoman thought it a horrible thing to attest to an accusation that\r\ntouched the life of her lover, which was also a lie. Timidius, however,\r\nwanted to have her brought to the torture. Caius was irritated at this\r\nreproach upon him, and commanded Cherea, without any delay, to torture\r\nQuintilia, as he used to employ Cherea in such bloody matters, and those\r\nthat required the torture, because he thought he would do it the more\r\nbarbarously, in order to avoid that imputation of effeminacy which he\r\nhad laid upon him. But Quintilia, when she was brought to the rack, trod\r\nupon the foot of one of her associates, and let him know that he might\r\nbe of good courage, and not be afraid of the consequence of her\r\ntortures, for that she would bear them with magnanimity. Cherea tortured\r\nthis woman after a cruel manner; unwillingly indeed, but because he\r\ncould not help it. He then brought her, without being in the least moved\r\nat what she had suffered, into the presence of Caius, and that in such a\r\nstate as was sad to behold; and Caius, being somewhat affected with the\r\nsight of Quintilia, who had her body miserably disordered by the pains\r\nshe had undergone, freed both her and Pompedius of the crime laid to\r\ntheir charge. He also gave her money to make her an honorable amends,\r\nand comfort her for that maiming of her body which she had suffered, and\r\nfor her glorious patience under such insufferable torments.\r\n\r\n6. This matter sorely grieved Cherea, as having been the cause, as far\r\nas he could, or the instrument, of those miseries to men, which seemed\r\nworthy of consolation to Caius himself; on which account he said to\r\nClement and to Papinius, [of whom Clement was general of the army, and\r\nPapinius was a tribune,] \"To be sure, O Clement, we have no way failed\r\nin our guarding the emperor; for as to those that have made conspiracies\r\nagainst his government, some have been slain by our care and pains, and\r\nsome have been by us tortured, and this to such a degree, that he hath\r\nhimself pitied them. How great then is our virtue in submitting to\r\nconduct his armies!\" Clement held his peace, but showed the shame he was\r\nunder in obeying Caius's orders, both by his eyes and his blushing\r\ncountenance, while he thought it by no means right to accuse the emperor\r\nin express words, lest their own safety should be endangered thereby.\r\nUpon which Cherea took courage, and spake to him without fear of the\r\ndangers that were before him, and discoursed largely of the sore\r\ncalamities under which the city and the government then labored, and\r\nsaid, \"We may indeed pretend in words that Caius is the person unto whom\r\nthe cause of such miseries ought to be imputed; but, in the opinion of\r\nsuch as are able to judge uprightly, it is I, O Clement! and this\r\nPapinius, and before us thou thyself, who bring these tortures upon the\r\nRomans, and upon all mankind. It is not done by our being subservient to\r\nthe commands of Caius, but it is done by our own consent; for whereas it\r\nis in our power to put an end to the life of this man, who hath so\r\nterribly injured the citizens and his subjects, we are his guard in\r\nmischief, and his executioners instead of his soldiers, and are the\r\ninstruments of his cruelty. We bear these weapons, not for our liberty,\r\nnot for the Roman government, but only for his preservation, who hath\r\nenslaved both their bodies and their minds; and we are every day\r\npolluted with the blood that we shed, and the torments we inflict upon\r\nothers; and this we do, till somebody becomes Caius's instrument in\r\nbringing the like miseries upon ourselves. Nor does he thus employ us\r\nbecause he hath a kindness for us, but rather because he hath a\r\nsuspicion of us, as also because when abundance more have been killed,\r\n[for Caius will set no bounds to his wrath, since he aims to do all, not\r\nout of regard to justice, but to his own pleasure,] we shall also\r\nourselves be exposed to his cruelty; whereas we ought to be the means of\r\nconfirming the security and liberty of all, and at the same time to\r\nresolve to free ourselves from dangers.\"\r\n\r\n7. Hereupon Clement openly commended Cherea's intentions, but bid him\r\nhold his tongue; for that in case his words should get out among many,\r\nand such things should be spread abroad as were fit to be concealed, the\r\nplot would come to be discovered before it was executed, and they should\r\nbe brought to punishment; but that they should leave all to futurity,\r\nand the hope which thence arose, that some fortunate event would come to\r\ntheir assistance; that, as for himself, his age would not permit him to\r\nmake any attempt in that case. \"However, although perhaps I could\r\nsuggest what may be safer than what thou, Cherea, hast contrived and\r\nsaid, yet how is it possible for any one to suggest what is more for thy\r\nreputation?\" So Clement went his way home, with deep reflections on what\r\nhe had heard, and what he had himself said. Cherea also was under a\r\nconcern, and went quickly to Cornelius Sabinus, who was himself one of\r\nthe tribunes, and whom he otherwise knew to be a worthy man, and a lover\r\nof liberty, and on that account very uneasy at the present management of\r\npublic affairs, he being desirous to come immediately to the execution\r\nof what had been determined, and thinking it right for him to propose it\r\nto the other, and afraid lest Clement should discover them, and besides\r\nlooking upon delays and puttings off to be the next to desisting from\r\nthe enterprise.\r\n\r\n8. But as all was agreeable to Sabinus, who had himself, equally without\r\nCherea, the same design, but had been silent for want of a person to\r\nwhom he could safely communicate that design; so having now met with\r\none, who not only promised to conceal what he heard, but who had already\r\nopened his mind to him, he was much more encouraged, and desired of\r\nCherea that no delay might be made therein. Accordingly they went to\r\nMinucianus, who was as virtuous a man, and as zealous to do glorious\r\nactions, as themselves, and suspected by Caius on occasion of the\r\nslaughter of Lepidus; for Minucianus and Lepidus were intimate friends,\r\nand both in fear of the dangers that they were under; for Caius was\r\nterrible to all the great men, as appearing ready to act a mad part\r\ntowards each of them in particular, and towards all of them in general;\r\nand these men were afraid of one another, while they were yet uneasy at\r\nthe posture of affairs, but avoided to declare their mind and their\r\nhatred against Caius to one another, out of fear of the dangers they\r\nmight be in thereby, although they perceived by other means their mutual\r\nhatred against Caius, and on that account were not averse to a mutual\r\nkindness one towards another.\r\n\r\n9. When Minucianus and Cherea had met together, and saluted one another,\r\n[as they had been used on former conversations to give the upper hand to\r\nMinucianus, both on account of his eminent dignity, for he was the\r\nnoblest of all the citizens, and highly commended by all men, especially\r\nwhen he made speeches to them,] Minucianus began first, and asked\r\nCherea, What was the watchword he had received that day from Caius; for\r\nthe affront which was offered Cherea, in giving the watchwords, was\r\nfamous over the city. But Cherea made no delay so long as to reply to\r\nthat question, out of the joy he had that Minueianus would have such\r\nconfidence in him as to discourse with him. \"But do thou,\" said he,\r\n\"give me the watchword of liberty. And I return thee my thanks that thou\r\nhast so greatly encouraged me to exert myself after an extraordinary\r\nmanner; nor do I stand in need of many words to encourage me, since both\r\nthou and I are of the same mind, and partakers of the same resolutions,\r\nand this before we have conferred together. I have indeed but one sword\r\ngirt on, but this one will serve us both. Come on, therefore, let us set\r\nabout the work. Do thou go first, if thou hast a mind, and bid me follow\r\nthee; or else I will go first, and thou shalt assist me, and we will\r\nassist one another, and trust one another. Nor is there a necessity for\r\neven one sword to such as have a mind disposed to such works, by which\r\nmind the sword uses to be successful. I am zealous about this action,\r\nnor am I solicitous what I may myself undergo; for I can not at leisure\r\nto consider the dangers that may come upon myself, so deeply am I\r\ntroubled at the slavery our once free country is now under, and at the\r\ncontempt cast upon our excellent laws, and at the destruction which\r\nhangs over all men, by the means of Caius. I wish that I may be judged\r\nby thee, and that thou mayst esteem me worthy of credit in these\r\nmatters, seeing we are both of the same opinion, and there is herein no\r\ndifference between us.\"\r\n\r\n10. When Minucianus saw the vehemency with which Cherea delivered\r\nhimself, he gladly embraced him, and encouraged him in his bold attempt,\r\ncommending him, and embracing him; so he let him go with his good\r\nwishes; and some affirm that he thereby confirmed Minucianus in the\r\nprosecution of what had been agreed among them; for as Cherea entered\r\ninto the court, the report runs, that a voice came from among the\r\nmultitude to encourage him, which bid him finish what he was about, and\r\ntake the opportunity that Providence afforded; and that Cherea at first\r\nsuspected that some one of the conspirators had betrayed him, and he was\r\ncaught, but at length perceived that it was by way of exhortation.\r\nWhether somebody 3 that was conscious of what he was about, gave a\r\nsignal for his encouragement, or whether it was God himself, who looks\r\nupon the actions of men, that encouraged him to go on boldly in his\r\ndesign, is uncertain. The plot was now communicated to a great many, and\r\nthey were all in their armor; some of the conspirators being senators,\r\nand some of the equestrian order, and as many of the soldiery as were\r\nmade acquainted with it; for there was not one of them who would not\r\nreckon it a part of his happiness to kill Caius; and on that account\r\nthey were all very zealous in the affair, by what means soever any one\r\ncould come at it, that he might not be behindhand in these virtuous\r\ndesigns, but might be ready with all his alacrity or power, both by\r\nwords and actions, to complete this slaughter of a tyrant. And besides\r\nthese, Callistus also, who was a freed-man of Caius, and was the only\r\nman that had arrived at the greatest degree of power under him,—such a\r\npower, indeed, as was in a manner equal to the power of the tyrant\r\nhimself, by the dread that all men had of him, and by the great riches\r\nhe had acquired; for he took bribes most plenteously, and committed\r\ninjuries without bounds, and was more extravagant in the use of his\r\npower in unjust proceedings than any other. He also knew the disposition\r\nof Caius to be implacable, and never to be turned from what he had\r\nresolved on. He had withal many other reasons why he thought himself in\r\ndanger, and the vastness of his wealth was not one of the least of them;\r\non which account he privately ingratiated himself with Claudius, and\r\ntransferred his courtship to him, out of this hope, that in case, upon\r\nthe removal of Caius, the government should come to him, his interest in\r\nsuch changes should lay a foundation for his preserving his dignity\r\nunder him, since he laid in beforehand a stock of merit, and did\r\nClaudius good offices in his promotion. He had also the boldness to\r\npretend that he had been persuaded to make away with Claudius, by\r\npoisoning him, but had still invented ten thousand excuses for delaying\r\nto do it. But it seems probable to me that Callistus only counterfeited\r\nthis, in order to ingratiate himself with Claudius; for if Caius had\r\nbeen in earnest resolved to take off Claudius, he would not have\r\nadmitted of Callistus's excuses; nor would Callistus, if he had been\r\nenjoined to do such an act as was desired by Caius, have put it off; nor\r\nif he had disobeyed those injunctions of his master, had he escaped\r\nimmediate punishment; while Claudius was preserved from the madness of\r\nCaius by a certain Divine providence, and Callistus pretended to such a\r\npiece of merit as he no way deserved.\r\n\r\n11. However, the execution of Cherea's designs was put off from day to\r\nday, by the sloth of many therein concerned; for as to Cherea himself,\r\nhe would not willingly make any delay in that execution, thinking every\r\ntime a fit time for it; for frequent opportunities offered themselves;\r\nas when Caius went up to the capitol to sacrifice for his daughter, or\r\nwhen he stood upon his royal palace, and threw gold and silver pieces of\r\nmoney among the people, he might be pushed down headlong, because the\r\ntop of the palace, that looks towards the market-place, was very high;\r\nand also when he celebrated the mysteries, which he had appointed at\r\nthat time; for he was then no way secluded from the people, but\r\nsolicitous to do every thing carefully and decently, and was free from\r\nall suspicion that he should be then assaulted by any body; and although\r\nthe gods should afford him no divine assistance to enable him to take\r\naway his life, yet had he strength himself sufficient to despatch Caius,\r\neven without a sword. Thus was Chorea angry at his fellow conspirators,\r\nfor fear they should suffer a proper opportunity to pass by; and they\r\nwere themselves sensible that he had just cause to be angry at them, and\r\nthat his eagerness was for their advantage; yet did they desire he would\r\nhave a little longer patience, lest, upon any disappointment they might\r\nmeet with, they should put the city into disorder, and an inquisition\r\nshould be made after the conspiracy, and should render the courage of\r\nthose that were to attack Caius without success, while he would then\r\nsecure himself more carefully than ever against them; that it would\r\ntherefore be the best to set about the work when the shows were\r\nexhibited in the palace. These shows were acted in honor of that Cæsar 4\r\nwho first of all changed the popular government, and transferred it to\r\nhimself; galleries being fixed before the palace, where the Romans that\r\nwere patricians became spectators, together with their children and\r\ntheir wives, and Cæsar himself was to be also a spectator; and they\r\nreckoned, among those many ten thousands who would there be crowded into\r\na narrow compass, they should have a favorable opportunity to make their\r\nattempt upon him as he came in, because his guards that should protect\r\nhim, if any of them should have a mind to do it, would not here be able\r\nto give him any assistance.\r\n\r\n12. Cherea consented to this delay; and when the shows were exhibited,\r\nit was resolved to do the work the first day. But fortune, which allowed\r\na further delay to his slaughter, was too hard for their foregoing\r\nresolution; and as three days of the regular times for these shows were\r\nnow over, they had much ado to get the business done on the last day.\r\nThen Cherea called the conspirators together, and spake thus to them:\r\n\"So much time passed away without effort is a reproach to us, as\r\ndelaying to go through such a virtuous design as we are engaged in; but\r\nmore fatal will this delay prove if we be discovered, and the design be\r\nfrustrated; for Caius will then become more cruel in his unjust\r\nproceedings. Do we not see how long we deprive all our friends of their\r\nliberty, and give Caius leave still to tyrannize over them? while we\r\nought to have procured them security for the future, and, by laying a\r\nfoundation for the happiness of others, gain to ourselves great\r\nadmiration and honor for all time to come.\" Now while the conspirators\r\nhad nothing tolerable to say by way of contradiction, and yet did not\r\nquite relish what they were doing, but stood silent and astonished, he\r\nsaid further, \"O my brave comrades! why do we make such delays? Do not\r\nyou see that this is the last day of these shows, and that Caius is\r\nabout to go to sea? for he is preparing to sail to Alexandria, in order\r\nto see Egypt. Is it therefore for your honor to let a man go out of your\r\nhands who is a reproach to mankind, and to permit him to go, after a\r\npompous manner, triumphing both at land and sea? Shall not we be justly\r\nashamed of ourselves, if we give leave to some Egyptian or other, who\r\nshall think his injuries insufferable to free-men, to kill him? As for\r\nmyself, I will no longer bear your slow proceedings, but will expose\r\nmyself to the dangers of the enterprise this very day, and bear\r\ncheerfully whatsoever shall be the consequence of the attempt; nor, let\r\nthem be ever so great, will I put them off any longer: for, to a wise\r\nand courageous man, what can be more miserable than that, while I am\r\nalive, any one else should kill Caius, and deprive me of the honor of so\r\nvirtuous an action?\"\r\n\r\n13. When Cherea had spoken thus, he zealously set about the work, and\r\ninspired courage into the rest to go on with it, and they were all eager\r\nto fall to it without further delay. So he was at the palace in the\r\nmorning, with his equestrian sword girt on him; for it was the custom\r\nthat the tribunes should ask for the watchword with their swords on, and\r\nthis was the day on which Cherea was, by custom, to receive the\r\nwatchword; and the multitude were already come to the palace, to be soon\r\nenough for seeing the shows, and that in great crowds, and one\r\ntumultuously crushing another, while Caius was delighted with this\r\neagerness of the multitude; for which reason there was no order observed\r\nin the seating men, nor was any peculiar place appointed for the\r\nsenators, or for the equestrian order; but they sat at random, men and\r\nwomen together, and free-men were mixed with the slaves. So Caius came\r\nout in a solemn manner, and offered sacrifice to Augustus Cæsar, in\r\nwhose honor indeed these shows were celebrated. Now it happened, upon\r\nthe fall of a certain priest, that the garment of Asprenas, a senator,\r\nwas filled with blood, which made Caius laugh, although this was an\r\nevident omen to Asprenas, for he was slain at the same time with Caius.\r\nIt is also related that Caius was that day, contrary to his usual\r\ncustom, so very affable and good-natured in his conversation, that every\r\none of those that were present were astonished at it. After the\r\nsacrifice was over, Caius betook himself to see the shows, and sat down\r\nfor that purpose, as did also the principal of his friends sit near him.\r\nNow the parts of the theater were so fastened together, as it used to be\r\nevery year, in the manner following: It had two doors, the one door led\r\nto the open air, the other was for going into, or going out of, the\r\ncloisters, that those within the theater might not be thereby disturbed;\r\nbut out of one gallery there went an inward passage, parted into\r\npartitions also, which led into another gallery, to give room to the\r\ncombatants and to the musicians to go out as occasion served. When the\r\nmultitude were set down, and Cherea, with the other tribunes, were set\r\ndown also, and the right corner of the theater was allotted to Cæsar,\r\none Vatinius, a senator, commander of the praetorian band, asked of\r\nCluvius, one that sat by him, and was of consular dignity also, whether\r\nhe had heard any thing of news, or not? but took care that nobody should\r\nhear what he said; and when Cluvius replied, that he had heard no news,\r\n\"Know then,\" said Vatinius, \"that the game of the slaughter of tyrants\r\nis to be played this day.\" But Cluvius replied \"O brave comrade hold thy\r\npeace, lest some other of the Achaians hear thy tale.\" And as there was\r\nabundance of autumnal fruit thrown among the spectators, and a great\r\nnumber of birds, that were of great value to such as possessed them, on\r\naccount of their rareness, Caius was pleased with the birds fighting for\r\nthe fruits, and with the violence wherewith the spectators seized upon\r\nthem: and here he perceived two prodigies that happened there; for an\r\nactor was introduced, by whom a leader of robbers was crucified, and the\r\npantomime brought in a play called Cinyras, wherein he himself was to be\r\nslain, as well as his daughter Myrrha, and wherein a great deal of\r\nfictitious blood was shed, both about him that was crucified, and also\r\nabout Cinyras. It was also confessed that this was the same day wherein\r\nPausanias, a friend of Philip, the son of Amyntas, who was king of\r\nMacedonia, slew him, as he was entering into the theater. And now Caius\r\nwas in doubt whether he should tarry to the end of the shows, because it\r\nwas the last day, or whether he should not go first to the bath, and to\r\ndinner, and then return and sit down as before. Hereupon Minucianus, who\r\nsat over Caius, and was afraid that the opportunity should fail them,\r\ngot up, because he saw Cherea was already gone out, and made haste out,\r\nto confirm him in his resolution; but Caius took hold of his garment, in\r\nan obliging way, and said to him, \"O brave man! whither art thou going?\"\r\nWhereupon, out of reverence to Cæsar, as it seemed, he sat down again;\r\nbut his fear prevailed over him, and in a little time he got up again,\r\nand then Caius did no way oppose his going out, as thinking that he went\r\nout to perform some necessities of nature. And Asprenas, who was one of\r\nthe confederates, persuaded Caius to go out to the bath, and to dinner,\r\nand then to come in again, as desirous that what had been resolved on\r\nmight be brought to a conclusion immediately.\r\n\r\n14. So Cherea's associates placed themselves in order, as the time would\r\npermit them, and they were obliged to labor hard, that the place which\r\nwas appointed them should not be left by them; but they had an\r\nindignation at the tediousness of the delays, and that what they were\r\nabout should be put off any longer, for it was already about the ninth 5\r\nhour of the day; and Cherea, upon Caius's tarrying so long, had a great\r\nmind to go in, and fall upon him in his seat, although he foresaw that\r\nthis could not be done without much bloodshed, both of the senators, and\r\nof those of the equestrian order that were present; and although he knew\r\nthis must happen, yet had he a great mind to do so, as thinking it a\r\nright thing to procure security and freedom to all, at the expense of\r\nsuch as might perish at the same time. And as they were just going back\r\ninto the entrance to the theater, word was brought them that Caius was\r\narisen, whereby a tumult was made; hereupon the conspirators thrust away\r\nthe crowd, under pretense as if Caius was angry at them, but in reality\r\nas desirous to have a quiet place, that should have none in it to defend\r\nhim, while they set about Caius's slaughter. Now Claudius, his uncle,\r\nwas gone out before, and Marcus Vinicius his sister's husband, as also\r\nValellus of Asia; whom though they had had such a mind to put out of\r\ntheir places, the reverence to their dignity hindered them so to do;\r\nthen followed Caius, with Paulus Arruntius: and because Caius was now\r\ngotten within the palace, he left the direct road, along which those his\r\nservants stood that were in waiting, and by which road Claudius had gone\r\nout before, Caius turned aside into a private narrow passage, in order\r\nto go to the place for bathing, as also in order to take a view of the\r\nboys that came out of Asia, who were sent thence, partly to sing hymns\r\nin these mysteries which were now celebrated, and partly to dance in the\r\nPyrrhic way of dancing upon the theatres. So Cherea met him, and asked\r\nhim for the watchword; upon Caius's giving him one of his ridiculous\r\nwords, he immediately reproached him, and drew his sword, and gave him a\r\nterrible stroke with it, yet was not this stroke mortal. And although\r\nthere be those that say it was so contrived on purpose by Chorea, that\r\nCaius should not be killed at one blow, but should be punished more\r\nseverely by a multitude of wounds; yet does this story appear to me\r\nincredible, because the fear men are under in such actions does not\r\nallow them to use their reason. And if Cherea was of that mind, I esteem\r\nhim the greatest of all fools, in pleasing himself in his spite against\r\nCaius, rather than immediately procuring safety to himself and to his\r\nconfederates from the dangers they were in, because there might many\r\nthings still happen for helping Caius's escape, if he had not already\r\ngiven up the ghost; for certainly Cherea would have regard, not so much\r\nto the punishment of Caius, as to the affliction himself and his friends\r\nwere in, while it was in his power, after such success, to keep silent,\r\nand to escape the wrath of Caius's defenders, and not to leave it to\r\nuncertainty whether he should gain the end he aimed at or not, and after\r\nan unreasonable manner to act as if he had a mind to ruin himself, and\r\nlose the opportunity that lay before him. But every body may guess as he\r\nplease about this matter. However, Caius was staggered with the pain\r\nthat the blow gave him; for the stroke of the sword falling in the\r\nmiddle, between the shoulder and the neck, was hindered by the first\r\nbone of the breast from proceeding any further. Nor did he either cry\r\nout, [in such astonishment was he,] nor did he call out for any of his\r\nfriends; whether it were that he had no confidence in them, or that his\r\nmind was otherwise disordered, but he groaned under the pain he endured,\r\nand presently went forward and fled; when Cornelius Sabinus, who was\r\nalready prepared in his mind so to do, thrust him down upon his knee,\r\nwhere many of them stood round about him, and struck him with their\r\nswords; and they cried out, and encouraged one another all at once to\r\nstrike him again; but all agree that Aquila gave him the finishing\r\nstroke, which directly killed him. But one may justly ascribe this act\r\nto Cherea; for although many concurred in the act itself, yet was he the\r\nfirst contriver of it, and began long before all the rest to prepare for\r\nit, and was the first man that boldly spake of it to the rest; and upon\r\ntheir admission of what he said about it, he got the dispersed\r\nconspirators together; he prepared every thing after a prudent manner,\r\nand by suggesting good advice, showed himself far superior to the rest,\r\nand made obliging speeches to them, insomuch that he even compelled them\r\nall to go on, who otherwise had not courage enough for that purpose; and\r\nwhen opportunity served to use his sword in hand, he appeared first of\r\nall ready so to do, and gave the first blow in this virtuous slaughter;\r\nhe also brought Caius easily into the power of the rest, and almost\r\nkilled him himself, insomuch that it is but just to ascribe all that the\r\nrest did to the advice, and bravery, and labors of the hands of Cherea.\r\n\r\n15. Thus did Caius come to his end, and lay dead, by the many wounds\r\nwhich had been given him. Now Cherea and his associates, upon Caius's\r\nslaughter, saw that it was impossible for them to save themselves, if\r\nthey should all go the same way, partly on account of the astonishment\r\nthey were under; for it was no small danger they had incurred by killing\r\nan emperor, who was honored and loved by the madness of the people,\r\nespecially when the soldiers were likely to make a bloody inquiry after\r\nhis murderers. The passages also were narrow wherein the work was done,\r\nwhich were also crowded with a great multitude of Caius's attendants,\r\nand of such of the soldiers as were of the emperor's guard that day;\r\nwhence it was that they went by other ways, and came to the house of\r\nGermanicus, the father of Caius, whom they had now killed [which house\r\nadjoined to the palace; for while the edifice was one, it was built in\r\nits several parts by those particular persons who had been emperors, and\r\nthose parts bare the names of those that built them or the name of him\r\nwho had begun to build its parts]. So they got away from the insults of\r\nthe multitude, and then were for the present out of danger, that is, so\r\nlong as the misfortune which had overtaken the emperor was not known.\r\nThe Germans were the first who perceived that Caius was slain. These\r\nGermans were Caius's guard, and carried the name of the country whence\r\nthey were chosen, and composed the Celtic legion. The men of that\r\ncountry are naturally passionate, which is commonly the temper of some\r\nother of the barbarous nations also, as being not used to consider much\r\nabout what they do; they are of robust bodies and fall upon their\r\nenemies as soon as ever they are attacked by them; and which way soever\r\nthey go, they perform great exploits. When, therefore, these German\r\nguards understood that Caius was slain, they were very sorry for it,\r\nbecause they did not use their reason in judging about public affairs,\r\nbut measured all by the advantages themselves received, Caius being\r\nbeloved by them because of the money he gave them, by which he had\r\npurchased their kindness to him; so they drew their swords, and Sabinus\r\nled them on. He was one of the tribunes, not by the means of the\r\nvirtuous actions of his progenitors, for he had been a gladiator, but he\r\nhad obtained that post in the army by his having a robust body. So these\r\nGermans marched along the houses in quest of Cæsar's murderers, and cut\r\nAsprenas to pieces, because he was the first man they fell upon, and\r\nwhose garment it was that the blood of the sacrifices stained, as I have\r\nsaid already, and which foretold that this his meeting the soldiers\r\nwould not be for his good. Then did Norbanus meet them, who was one of\r\nthe principal nobility of and could show many generals of armies among\r\nhis ancestors; but they paid no regard to his dignity; yet was he of\r\nsuch great strength, that he wrested the sword of the first of those\r\nthat assaulted him out of his hands, and appeared plainly not to be\r\nwilling to die without a struggle for his life, until he was surrounded\r\nby a great number of assailants, and died by the multitude of the wounds\r\nwhich they gave him. The third man was Anteius, a senator, and a few\r\nothers with him. He did not meet with these Germans by chance, as the\r\nrest did before, but came to show his hatred to Caius, and because he\r\nloved to see Caius lie dead with his own eyes, and took a pleasure in\r\nthat sight; for Caius had banished Anteius's father, who was of the same\r\nname with himself, and being not satisfied with that, he sent out his\r\nsoldiers, and slew him; so he was come to rejoice at the sight of him,\r\nnow he was dead. But as the house was now all in a tumult, when he was\r\naiming to hide himself, he could not escape that accurate search which\r\nthe Germans made, while they barbarously slew those that were guilty,\r\nand those that were not guilty, and this equally also. And thus were\r\nthese [three] persons slain.\r\n\r\n16. But when the rumor that Caius was slain reached the theater, they\r\nwere astonished at it, and could not believe it; even some that\r\nentertained his destruction with great pleasure, and were more desirous\r\nof its happening than almost any other faction that could come to them,\r\nwere under such a fear, that they could not believe it. There were also\r\nthose who greatly distrusted it, because they were unwilling that any\r\nsuch thing should come to Caius, nor could believe it, though it were\r\never so true, because they thought no man could possibly so much power\r\nas to kill Caius. These were the women, and the children, and the\r\nslaves, and some of the soldiery. This last sort had taken his pay, and\r\nin a manner tyrannized with him, and had abused the best of the\r\ncitizens, in being subservient to his unjust commands, in order to gain\r\nhonors and advantages to themselves; but for the women and the youth,\r\nthey had been inveigled with shows, and the fighting of the gladiators,\r\nand certain distributions of flesh-meat among them, which things them\r\npretense were designed for the pleasing of multitude, but in reality to\r\nsatiate the barbarous cruelty and madness of Caius. The slaves also were\r\nsorry, because they were by Caius allowed to accuse and to despise their\r\nmasters, and they could have recourse to his assistance when they had\r\nunjustly affronted them; for he was very easy in believing them against\r\ntheir masters, even when they the city, accused them falsely; and if\r\nthey would discover what money their masters had, they might soon obtain\r\nboth riches and liberty, as the rewards of their accusations, because\r\nthe reward of these informers was the eighth 6 part of the criminal's\r\nsubstance. As to the nobles, although the report appeared credible to\r\nsome of them, either because they knew of the plot beforehand, or\r\nbecause they wished it might be true; however, they concealed not only\r\nthe joy they had at the relation of it, but that they had heard any\r\nthing at all about it. These last acted so out of the fear they had,\r\nthat if the report proved false, they should be punished, for having so\r\nsoon let men know their minds. But those that knew Caius was dead,\r\nbecause they were partners with the conspirators, they concealed all\r\nstill more cautiously, as not knowing one another's minds; and fearing\r\nlest they should speak of it to some of those to whom the continuance of\r\ntyranny was advantageous; and if Caius should prove to be alive, they\r\nmight be informed against, and punished. And another report went about,\r\nthat although Caius had been wounded indeed, yet was not he dead, but\r\nalive still, and under the physician's hands. Nor was any one looked\r\nupon by another as faithful enough to be trusted, and to whom any one\r\nwould open his mind; for he was either a friend to Caius, and therefore\r\nsuspected to favor his tyranny, or he was one that hated him, who\r\ntherefore might be suspected to deserve the less credit, because of his\r\nill-will to him. Nay, it was said by some [and this indeed it was that\r\ndeprived the nobility of their hopes, and made them sad] that Caius was\r\nin a condition to despise the dangers he had been in, and took no care\r\nof healing his wounds, but was gotten away into the market- place, and,\r\nbloody as he was, was making an harangue to the people. And these were\r\nthe conjectural reports of those that were so unreasonable as to\r\nendeavor to raise tumults, which they turned different ways, according\r\nto the opinions of the bearers. Yet did they not leave their seats, for\r\nfear of being accused, if they should go out before the rest; for they\r\nshould not be sentenced according to the real intention with which they\r\nwent out, but according to the supposals of the accusers and of the\r\njudges.\r\n\r\n17. But now a multitude of Germans had surrounded the theater with their\r\nswords drawn: all the spectators looked for nothing but death, and at\r\nevery one coming in a fear seized upon them, as if they were to be cut\r\nin pieces immediately; and in great distress they were, as neither\r\nhaving courage enough to go out of the theater, nor believing themselves\r\nsafe from dangers if they tarried there. And when the Germans came upon\r\nthem, the cry was so great, that the theater rang again with the\r\nentreaties of the spectators to the soldiers, pleading that they were\r\nentirely ignorant of every thing that related to such seditious\r\ncontrivances, and that if there were any sedition raised, they knew\r\nnothing of it; they therefore begged that they would spare them, and not\r\npunish those that had not the least hand in such bold crimes as belonged\r\nto other persons, while they neglected to search after such as had\r\nreally done whatsoever it be that hath been done. Thus did these people\r\nappeal to God, and deplore their infelicity with shedding of tears, and\r\nbeating their faces, and said every thing that the most imminent danger\r\nand the utmost concern for their lives could dictate to them. This brake\r\nthe fury of the soldiers, and made them repent of what they minded to do\r\nto the spectators, which would have been the greatest instance of\r\ncruelty. And so it appeared to even these savages, when they had once\r\nfixed the heads of those that were slain with Asprenas upon the altar;\r\nat which sight the spectators were sorely afflicted, both upon the\r\nconsideration of the dignity of the persons, and out of a commiseration\r\nof their sufferings; nay, indeed, they were almost in as great disorder\r\nat the prospect of the danger themselves were in, seeing it was still\r\nuncertain whether they should entirely escape the like calamity. Whence\r\nit was that such as thoroughly and justly hated Caius could yet no way\r\nenjoy the pleasure of his death, because they were themselves in\r\njeopardy of perishing together with him; nor had they hitherto any firm\r\nassurance of surviving.\r\n\r\n18. There was at this time one Euaristus Arruntius, a public crier in\r\nthe market, and therefore of a strong and audible voice, who vied in\r\nwealth with the richest of the Romans, and was able to do what he\r\npleased in the city, both then and afterward. This man put himself into\r\nthe most mournful habit he could, although he had a greater hatred\r\nagainst Caius than any one else; his fear and his wise contrivance to\r\ngain his safety taught him so to do, and prevailed over his present\r\npleasure; so he put on such a mournful dress as he would have done had\r\nhe lost his dearest friends in the world; this man came into the\r\ntheater, and informed them of the death of Caius, and by this means put\r\nan end to that state of ignorance the men had been in. Arruntius also\r\nwent round about the pillars, and called out to the Germans, as did the\r\ntribunes with him, bidding them put up their swords, and telling them\r\nthat Caius was dead. And this proclamation it was plainly which saved\r\nthose that were collected together in the theater, and all the rest who\r\nany way met the Germans; for while they had hopes that Caius had still\r\nany breath in him, they abstained from no sort of mischief; and such an\r\nabundant kindness they still had for Caius, that they would willingly\r\nhave prevented the plot against him, and procured his escape from so sad\r\na misfortune, at the expense of their own lives. But they now left off\r\nthe warm zeal they had to punish his enemies, now they were fully\r\nsatisfied that Caius was dead, because it was now in vain for them to\r\nshow their zeal and kindness to him, when he who should reward them was\r\nperished. They were also afraid that they should be punished by the\r\nsenate, if they should go on in doing such injuries; that is, in case\r\nthe authority of the supreme governor should revert to them. And thus at\r\nlength a stop was put, though not without difficulty, to that rage which\r\npossessed the Germans on account of Caius's death.\r\n\r\n19. But Cherea was so much afraid for Minucianus, lest he should light\r\nupon the Germans now they were in their fury, that he went and spoke to\r\nevery one of the soldiers, and prayed them to take care of his\r\npreservation, and made himself great inquiry about him, lest he should\r\nhave been slain. And for Clement, he let Minucianus go when he was\r\nbrought to him, and, with many other of the senators, affirmed the\r\naction was right, and commended the virtue of those that contrived it,\r\nand had courage enough to execute it; and said that \"tyrants do indeed\r\nplease themselves and look big for a while, upon having the power to act\r\nunjustly; but do not however go happily out of the world, because they\r\nare hated by the virtuous; and that Caius, together with all his\r\nunhappiness, was become a conspirator against himself, before these\r\nother men who attacked him did so; and by becoming intolerable, in\r\nsetting aside the wise provision the laws had made, taught his dearest\r\nfriends to treat him as an enemy; insomuch that although in common\r\ndiscourse these conspirators were those that slew Caius, yet that, in\r\nreality, he lies now dead as perishing by his own self.\"\r\n\r\n20. Now by this time the people in the theatre were arisen from their\r\nseats, and those that were within made a very great disturbance; the\r\ncause of which was this, that the spectators were too hasty in getting\r\naway. There was also one Aleyon, a physician, who hurried away, as if to\r\ncure those that were wounded, and under that pretense he sent those that\r\nwere with him to fetch what things were necessary for the healing of\r\nthose wounded persons, but in reality to get them clear of the present\r\ndangers they were in. Now the senate, during this interval, had met, and\r\nthe people also assembled together in the accustomed form, and were both\r\nemployed in searching after the murderers of Caius. The people did it\r\nvery zealously, but the senate in appearance only; for there was present\r\nValerius of Asia, one that had been consul; this man went to the people,\r\nas they were in disorder, and very uneasy that they could not yet\r\ndiscover who they were that had murdered the emperor; he was then\r\nearnestly asked by them all who it was that had done it. He replied, \"I\r\nwish I had been the man.\" The consuls 7 also published an edict, wherein\r\nthey accused Caius, and gave order to the people then got together, and\r\nto the soldiers, to go home; and gave the people hopes of the abatement\r\nof the oppressions they lay under; and promised the soldiers, if they\r\nlay quiet as they used to do, and would not go abroad to do mischief\r\nunjustly, that they would bestow rewards upon them; for there was reason\r\nto fear lest the city might suffer harm by their wild and ungovernable\r\nbehavior, if they should once betake themselves to spoil the citizens,\r\nor plunder the temples. And now the whole multitude of the senators were\r\nassembled together, and especially those that had conspired to take away\r\nthe life of Caius, who put on at this time an air of great assurance,\r\nand appeared with great magnanimity, as if the administration of the\r\npublic affairs were already devolved upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How The Senators Determined To Restore The Democracy; But The\r\nSoldiers Were For Preserving The Monarchy, Concerning The Slaughter Of\r\nCaius's Wife And Daughter. A Character Of Caius's Morals.\r\n\r\n1. When the public affairs were in this posture, Claudius was on the\r\nsudden hurried away out of his house; for the soldiers had a meeting\r\ntogether; and when they had debated about what was to be done, they saw\r\nthat a democracy was incapable of managing such a vast weight of public\r\naffairs; and that if it should be set up, it would not be for their\r\nadvantage; and in case any one of those already in the government should\r\nobtain the supreme power, it would in all respects be to their grief, if\r\nthey were not assisting to him in this advancement; that it would\r\ntherefore be right for them, while the public affairs were unsettled, to\r\nchoose Claudius emperor, who was uncle to the deceased Caius, and of a\r\nsuperior dignity and worth to every one of those that were assembled\r\ntogether in the senate, both on account of the virtues of his ancestors,\r\nand of the learning he had acquired in his education; and who, if once\r\nsettled in the empire, would reward them according to their deserts, and\r\nbestow largesses upon them. These were their consultations, and they\r\nexecuted the same immediately. Claudius was therefore seized upon\r\nsuddenly by the soldiery. But Cneas Sentins Saturninus, although he\r\nunderstood that Claudius was seized, and that he intended to claim the\r\ngovernment, unwillingly indeed in appearance, but in reality by his own\r\nfree consent, stood up in the senate, and, without being dismayed, made\r\nan exhortatory oration to them, and such a one indeed as was fit for men\r\nof freedom and generosity, and spake thus:\r\n\r\n2. \"Although it be a thing incredible, O Romans! because of the great\r\nlength of time, that so unexpected an event hath happened, yet are we\r\nnow in possession of liberty. How long indeed this will last is\r\nuncertain, and lies at the disposal of the gods, whose grant it is; yet\r\nsuch it is as is sufficient to make us rejoice, and be happy for the\r\npresent, although we may soon be deprived of it; for one hour is\r\nsufficient to those that are exercised in virtue, wherein we may live\r\nwith a mind accountable only to ourselves, in our own country, now free,\r\nand governed by such laws as this country once flourished under. As for\r\nmyself, I cannot remember our former time of liberty, as being born\r\nafter it was gone; but I am beyond measure filled with joy at the\r\nthoughts of our present freedom. I also esteem those that were born and\r\nbred up in that our former liberty happy men, and that those men are\r\nworthy of no less esteem than the gods themselves who have given us a\r\ntaste of it in this age; and I heartily wish that this quiet enjoyment\r\nof it, which we have at present, might continue to all ages. However,\r\nthis single day may suffice for our youth, as well as for us that are in\r\nyears. It will seem an age to our old men, if they might die during its\r\nhappy duration: it may also be for the instruction of the younger sort,\r\nwhat kind of virtue those men, from whose loins we are derived, were\r\nexercised in. As for ourselves, our business is, during the space of\r\ntime, to live virtuously, than which nothing can be more to our\r\nadvantage; which course of virtue it is alone that can preserve our\r\nliberty; for as to our ancient state, I have heard of it by the\r\nrelations of others; but as to our later state, during my lifetime, I\r\nhave known it by experience, and learned thereby what mischiefs\r\ntyrannies have brought upon this commonwealth, discouraging all virtue,\r\nand depriving persons of magnanimity of their liberty, and proving the\r\nteachers of flattery and slavish fear, because it leaves the public\r\nadministration not to be governed by wise laws, but by the humor of\r\nthose that govern. For since Julius Cæsar took it into his head to\r\ndissolve our democracy, and, by overbearing the regular system of our\r\nlaws, to bring disorders into our administration, and to get above right\r\nand justice, and to be a slave to his own inclinations, there is no kind\r\nof misery but what hath tended to the subversion of this city; while all\r\nthose that have succeeded him have striven one with another to overthrow\r\nthe ancient laws of their country, and have left it destitute of such\r\ncitizens as were of generous principles, because they thought it tended\r\nto their safety to have vicious men to converse withal, and not only to\r\nbreak the spirits of those that were best esteemed for their virtue, but\r\nto resolve upon their utter destruction. Of all which emperors, who have\r\nbeen many in number, and who laid upon us insufferable hardships during\r\nthe times of their government, this Caius, who hath been slain today,\r\nhath brought more terrible calamities upon us than did all the rest, not\r\nonly by exercising his ungoverned rage upon his fellow citizens, but\r\nalso upon his kindred and friends, and alike upon all others, and by\r\ninflicting still greater miseries upon them, as punishments, which they\r\nnever deserved, he being equally furious against men and against the\r\ngods. For tyrants are not content to gain their sweet pleasure, and this\r\nby acting injuriously, and in the vexation they bring both upon men's\r\nestates and their wives; but they look upon that to be their principal\r\nadvantage, when they can utterly overthrow the entire families of their\r\nenemies; while all lovers of liberty are the enemies of tyranny. Nor can\r\nthose that patiently endure what miseries they bring on them gain their\r\nfriendship; for as they are conscious of the abundant mischiefs they\r\nhave brought on these men, and how magnanimously they have borne their\r\nhard fortunes, they cannot but be sensible what evils they have done,\r\nand thence only depend on security from what they are suspicious of, if\r\nit may be in their power to take them quite out of the world. Since,\r\nthen, we are now gotten clear of such great misfortunes, and are only\r\naccountable to one another, [which form of government affords us the\r\nbest assurance of our present concord, and promises us the best security\r\nfrom evil designs, and will be most for our own glory in settling the\r\ncity in good order,] you ought, every one of you in particular, to make\r\nprovision for his own, and in general for the public utility: or, on the\r\ncontrary, they may declare their dissent to such things as have been\r\nproposed, and this without any hazard of danger to come upon them,\r\nbecause they have now no lord set over them, who, without fear of\r\npunishment, could do mischief to the city, and had an uncontrollable\r\npower to take off those that freely declared their opinions. Nor has any\r\nthing so much contributed to this increase of tyranny of late as sloth,\r\nand a timorous forbearance of contradicting the emperor's will; while\r\nmen had an over-great inclination to the sweetness of peace, and had\r\nlearned to live like slaves; and as many of us as either heard of\r\nintolerable calamities that happened at a distance from us, or saw the\r\nmiseries that were near us, out of the dread of dying virtuously,\r\nendured a death joined with the utmost infamy. We ought, then, in the\r\nfirst place, to decree the greatest honors we are able to those that\r\nhave taken off the tyrant, especially to Cherea Cassius; for this one\r\nman, with the assistance of the gods, hath, by his counsel and by his\r\nactions, been the procurer of our liberty. Nor ought we to forget him\r\nnow we have recovered our liberty, who, under the foregoing tyranny,\r\ntook counsel beforehand, and beforehand hazarded himself for our\r\nliberties; but ought to decree him proper honors, and thereby freely\r\ndeclare that he from the beginning acted with our approbation. And\r\ncertainly it is a very excellent thing, and what becomes free-men, to\r\nrequite their benefactors, as this man hath been a benefactor to us all,\r\nthough not at all like Cassius and Brutus, who slew Caius Julius\r\n[Cæsar]; for those men laid the foundations of sedition and civil wars\r\nin our city; but this man, together with his slaughter of the tyrant,\r\nhath set our city free from all those sad miseries which arose from the\r\ntyranny.\" 8\r\n\r\n3. And this was the purport of Sentius's oration, 9 which was received\r\nwith pleasure by the senators, and by as many of the equestrian order as\r\nwere present. And now one Trebellius Maximus rose up hastily, and took\r\noff Sentius's finger a ring, which had a stone, with the image of Caius\r\nengraven upon it, and which, in his zeal in speaking, and his\r\nearnestness in doing what he was about, as it was supposed, he had\r\nforgotten to take off himself. This sculpture was broken immediately.\r\nBut as it was now far in the night, Cherea demanded of the consuls the\r\nwatchword, who gave him this word, Liberty. These facts were the\r\nsubjects of admiration to themselves, and almost incredible; for it was\r\na hundred years since the democracy had been laid aside, when this\r\ngiving the watchword returned to the consuls; for before the city was\r\nsubject to tyrants, they were the commanders of the soldiers. But when\r\nCherea had received that watchword, he delivered it to those who were on\r\nthe senate's side, which were four regiments, who esteemed the\r\ngovernment without emperors to be preferable to tyranny. So these went\r\naway with their tribunes. The people also now departed very joyful, full\r\nof hope and of courage, as having recovered their former democracy, and\r\nwere no longer under an emperor; and Cherea was in very great esteem\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n4. And now Cherea was very uneasy that Caius's daughter and wife were\r\nstill alive, and that all his family did not perish with him, since\r\nwhosoever was left of them must be left for the ruin of the city and of\r\nthe laws. Moreover, in order to finish this matter with the utmost zeal,\r\nand in order to satisfy his hatred of Caius, he sent Julius Lupus, one\r\nof the tribunes, to kill Caius's wife and daughter. They proposed this\r\noffice to Lupus as to a kinsman of Clement, that he might be so far a\r\npartaker of this murder of the tyrant, and might rejoice in the virtue\r\nof having assisted his fellow citizens, and that he might appear to have\r\nbeen a partaker with those that were first in their designs against him.\r\nYet did this action appear to some of the conspirators to be too cruel,\r\nas to this using such severity to a woman, because Caius did more\r\nindulge his own ill-nature than use her advice in all that he did; from\r\nwhich ill-nature it was that the city was in so desperate a condition\r\nwith the miseries that were brought on it, and the flower of the city\r\nwas destroyed. But others accused her of giving her consent to these\r\nthings; nay, they ascribed all that Caius had done to her as the cause\r\nof it, and said she had given a potion to Caius, which had made him\r\nobnoxious to her, and had tied him down to love her by such evil\r\nmethods; insomuch that she, having rendered him distracted, was become\r\nthe author of all the mischiefs that had befallen the Romans, and that\r\nhabitable world which was subject to them. So that at length it was\r\ndetermined that she must die; nor could those of the contrary opinion at\r\nall prevail to have her saved; and Lupus was sent accordingly. Nor was\r\nthere any delay made in executing what he went about, but he was\r\nsubservient to those that sent him on the first opportunity, as desirous\r\nto be no way blameable in what might be done for the advantage of the\r\npeople. So when he was come into the palace, he found Cesonia, who was\r\nCaius's wife, lying by her husband's dead body, which also lay down on\r\nthe ground, and destitute of all such things as the law allows to the\r\ndead, and all over herself besmeared with the blood of her husband's\r\nwounds, and bewailing the great affliction she was under, her daughter\r\nlying by her also; and nothing else was heard in these her circumstances\r\nbut her complaint of Caius, as if he had not regarded what she had often\r\ntold him of beforehand; which words of hers were taken in a different\r\nsense even at that time, and are now esteemed equally ambiguous by those\r\nthat hear of them, and are still interpreted according to the different\r\ninclinations of people. Now some said that the words denoted that she\r\nhad advised him to leave off his mad behavior and his barbarous cruelty\r\nto the citizens, and to govern the public with moderation and virtue,\r\nlest he should perish by the same way, upon their using him as he had\r\nused them. But some said, that as certain words had passed concerning\r\nthe conspirators, she desired Caius to make no delay, but immediately to\r\nput them all to death, and this whether they were guilty or not, and\r\nthat thereby he would be out of the fear of any danger; and that this\r\nwas what she reproached him for, when she advised him so to do, but he\r\nwas too slow and tender in the matter. And this was what Cesonia said,\r\nand what the opinions of men were about it. But when she saw Lupus\r\napproach, she showed him Caius's dead body, and persuaded him to come\r\nnearer, with lamentation and tears; and as she perceived that Lupus was\r\nin disorder, and approached her in order to execute some design\r\ndisagreeable to himself, she was well aware for what purpose he came,\r\nand stretched out her naked throat, and that very cheerfully to him,\r\nbewailing her case, like one that utterly despaired of her life, and\r\nbidding him not to boggle at finishing the tragedy they had resolved\r\nupon relating to her. So she boldly received her death's wound at the\r\nhand of Lupus, as did the daughter after her. So Lupus made haste to\r\ninform Cherea of what he had done.\r\n\r\n5. This was the end of Caius, after he had reigned four years, within\r\nfour months. He was, even before he came to be emperor, ill-natured, and\r\none that had arrived at the utmost pitch of wickedness; a slave to his\r\npleasures, and a lover of calumny; greatly affected by every terrible\r\naccident, and on that account of a very murderous disposition where he\r\ndurst show it. He enjoyed his exorbitant power to this only purpose, to\r\ninjure those who least deserved it, with unreasonable insolence and got\r\nhis wealth by murder and injustice. He labored to appear above regarding\r\neither what was divine or agreeable to the laws, but was a slave to the\r\ncommendations of the populace; and whatsoever the laws determined to be\r\nshameful, and punished, that he esteemed more honorable than what was\r\nvirtuous. He was unmindful of his friends, how intimate soever, and\r\nthough they were persons of the highest character; and if he was once\r\nangry at any of them, he would inflict punishment upon them on the\r\nsmallest occasions, and esteemed every man that endeavored to lead a\r\nvirtuous life his enemy. And whatsoever he commanded, he would not admit\r\nof any contradiction to his inclinations; whence it was that he had\r\ncriminal conversation with his own sister; 10 from which occasion\r\nchiefly it was also that a bitter hatred first sprang up against him\r\namong the citizens, that sort of incest not having been known of a long\r\ntime; and so this provoked men to distrust him, and to hate him that was\r\nguilty of it. And for any great or royal work that he ever did, which\r\nmight be for the present and for future ages, nobody can name any such,\r\nbut only the haven that he made about Rhegium and Sicily, for the\r\nreception of the ships that brought corn from Egypt; which was indeed a\r\nwork without dispute very great in itself, and of very great advantage\r\nto the navigation. Yet was not this work brought to perfection by him,\r\nbut was the one half of it left imperfect, by reason of his want of\r\napplication to it; the cause of which was this, that he employed his\r\nstudies about useless matters, and that by spending his money upon such\r\npleasures as concerned no one's benefit but his own, he could not exert\r\nhis liberality in things that were undeniably of great consequence.\r\nOtherwise he was an excellent orator, and thoroughly acquainted with the\r\nGreek tongue, as well as with his own country or Roman language. He was\r\nalso able, off-hand and readily, to give answers to compositions made by\r\nothers, of considerable length and accuracy. He was also more skillful\r\nin persuading others to very great things than any one else, and this\r\nfrom a natural affability of temper, which had been improved by much\r\nexercise and pains-taking; for as he was the grandson 11 of the brother\r\nof Tiberius, whose successor he was, this was a strong inducement to his\r\nacquiring of learning, because Tiberius aspired after the highest pitch\r\nof that sort of reputation; and Caius aspired after the like glory for\r\neloquence, being induced thereto by the letters of his kinsman and his\r\nemperor. He was also among the first rank of his own citizens. But the\r\nadvantages he received from his learning did not countervail the\r\nmischief he brought upon himself in the exercise of his authority; so\r\ndifficult it is for those to obtain the virtue that is necessary for a\r\nwise man, who have the absolute power to do what they please without\r\ncontrol. At the first he got himself such friends as were in all\r\nrespects the most worthy, and was greatly beloved by them, while he\r\nimitated their zealous application to the learning and to the glorious\r\nactions of the best men; but when he became insolent towards them, they\r\nlaid aside the kindness they had for him, and began to hate him; from\r\nwhich hatred came that plot which they raised against him, and wherein\r\nhe perished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How Claudius Was Seized Upon And Brought Out Of His House And\r\nBrought To The Camp; And How The Senate Sent An Embassage To Him.\r\n\r\n1. Now Claudius, as I said before, went out of that way along which\r\nCaius was gone; and as the family was in a mighty disorder upon the sad\r\naccident of the murder of Caius, he was in great distress how to save\r\nhimself, and was found to have hidden himself in a certain narrow place,\r\nthough he had no other occasion for suspicion of any dangers, besides\r\nthe dignity of his birth; for while he was a private man, he behaved\r\nhimself with moderation, and was contented with his present fortune,\r\napplying himself to learning, and especially to that of the Greeks, and\r\nkeeping himself entirely clear from every thing that might bring on any\r\ndisturbance. But as at this time the multitude were under a\r\nconsternation, and the whole palace was full of the soldiers' madness,\r\nand the very emperor's guards seemed under the like fear and disorder\r\nwith private persons, the band called pretorian, which was the purest\r\npart of the army, was in consultation what was to be done at this\r\njuncture. Now all those that were at this consultation had little regard\r\nto the punishment Caius had suffered, because he justly deserved such\r\nhis fortune; but they were rather considering their own circumstances,\r\nhow they might take the best care of themselves, especially while the\r\nGermans were busy in punishing the murderers of Caius; which yet was\r\nrather done to gratify their own savage temper, than for the good of the\r\npublic; all which things disturbed Claudius, who was afraid of his own\r\nsafety, and this particularly because he saw the heads of Asprenas and\r\nhis partners carried about. His station had been on a certain elevated\r\nplace, whither a few steps led him, and whither he had retired in the\r\ndark by himself. But when Gratus, who was one of the soldiers that\r\nbelonged to the palace, saw him, but did not well know by his\r\ncountenance who he was, because it was dark, though he could well judge\r\nthat it was a man who was privately there on some design, he came nearer\r\nto him; and when Claudius desired that he would retire, he discovered\r\nwho he was, and owned him to be Claudius. So he said to his followers,\r\n\"This is a Germanicus; 12 come on, let us choose him for our emperor.\"\r\nBut when Claudius saw they were making preparations for taking him away\r\nby force, and was afraid they would kill him, as they had killed Caius,\r\nhe besought them to spare him, putting them in mind how quietly he had\r\ndemeaned himself, and that he was unacquainted with what had been done.\r\nHereupon Gratus smiled upon him, and took him by the right hand, and\r\nsaid, \"Leave off, sir, these low thoughts of saving yourself, while you\r\nought to have greater thoughts, even of obtaining the empire, which the\r\ngods, out of their concern for the habitable world, by taking Caius out\r\nof the way, commit to thy virtuous conduct. Go to, therefore, and accept\r\nof the throne of thy ancestors.\" So they took him up and carried him,\r\nbecause he was not then able to go on foot, such was his dread and his\r\njoy at what was told him.\r\n\r\n2. Now there was already gathered together about Gratus a great number\r\nof the guards; and when they saw Claudius carried off, they looked with\r\na sad countenance, as supposing that he was carried to execution for the\r\nmischiefs that had been lately done; while yet they thought him a man\r\nwho never meddled with public affairs all his life long, and one that\r\nhad met with no contemptible dangers under the reign of Caius; and some\r\nof them thought it reasonable that the consuls should take cognizance of\r\nthese matters; and as still more and more of the soldiery got together,\r\nthe crowd about him ran away, and Claudius could hardly go on, his body\r\nwas then so weak; and those who carried his sedan, upon an inquiry that\r\nwas made about his being carried off, ran away and saved themselves, as\r\ndespairing of their Lord's preservation. But when they were come into\r\nthe large court of the palace, [which, as the report goes about it, was\r\ninhabited first of all the parts of the city of Rome,] and had just\r\nreached the public treasury, many more soldiers came about him, as glad\r\nto see Claudius's face, and thought it exceeding right to make him\r\nemperor, on account of their kindness for Germanicus, who was his\r\nbrother, and had left behind him a vast reputation among all that were\r\nacquainted with him. They reflected also on the covetous temper of the\r\nleading men of the senate, and what great errors they had been guilty of\r\nwhen the senate had the government formerly; they also considered the\r\nimpossibility of such an undertaking, as also what dangers they should\r\nbe in, if the government should come to a single person, and that such a\r\none should possess it as they had no hand in advancing, and not to\r\nClaudius, who would take it as their grant, and as gained by their good-\r\nwill to him, and would remember the favors they had done him, and would\r\nmake them a sufficient recompense for the same.\r\n\r\n3. These were the discourses the soldiers had one with another by\r\nthemselves, and they communicated them to all such as came in to them.\r\nNow those that inquired about this matter willingly embraced the\r\ninvitation that was made them to join with the rest; so they carried\r\nClaudius into the camp, crowding about him as his guard, and\r\nencompassing him about, one chairman still succeeding another, that\r\ntheir vehement endeavors might not be hindered. But as to the populace\r\nand senators, they disagreed in their opinions. The latter were very\r\ndesirous to recover their former dignity, and were zealous to get clear\r\nof the slavery that had been brought on them by the injurious treatment\r\nof the tyrants, which the present opportunity afforded them; but for the\r\npeople, who were envious against them, and knew that the emperors were\r\ncapable of curbing their covetous temper, and were a refuge from them,\r\nthey were very glad that Claudius had been seized upon, and brought to\r\nthem, and thought that if Claudius were made emperor, he would prevent a\r\ncivil war, such as there was in the days of Pompey. But when the senate\r\nknew that Claudius was brought into the camp by the soldiers, they sent\r\nto him those of their body which had the best character for their\r\nvirtues, that they might inform him that he ought to do nothing by\r\nviolence, in order to gain the government; that he who was a single\r\nperson, one either already or hereafter to be a member of their body,\r\nought to yield to the senate, which consisted of so great a number; that\r\nhe ought to let the law take place in the disposal of all that related\r\nto the public order, and to remember how greatly the former tyrants had\r\nafflicted their city, and what dangers both he and they had escaped\r\nunder Caius; and that he ought not to hate the heavy burden of tyranny,\r\nwhen the injury is done by others, while he did himself willfully treat\r\nhis country after a mad and insolent manner; that if he would comply\r\nwith them, and demonstrate that his firm resolution was to live quietly\r\nand virtuously, he would have the greatest honors decreed to him that a\r\nfree people could bestow; and by subjecting himself to the law, would\r\nobtain this branch of commendation, that he acted like a man of virtue,\r\nboth as a ruler and a subject; but that if he would act foolishly, and\r\nlearn no wisdom by Caius's death, they would not permit him to go on;\r\nthat a great part of the army was got together for them, with plenty of\r\nweapons, and a great number of slaves, which they could make use of;\r\nthat good hope was a great matter in such cases, as was also good\r\nfortune; and that the gods would never assist any others but those that\r\nundertook to act with virtue and goodness, who can be no other than such\r\nas fight for the liberty of their country.\r\n\r\n4. Now these ambassadors, Veranius and Brocchus, who were both of them\r\ntribunes of the people, made this speech to Claudius; and falling down\r\nupon their knees, they begged of him that he would not throw the city\r\ninto wars and misfortunes; but when they saw what a multitude of\r\nsoldiers encompassed and guarded Claudius, and that the forces that were\r\nwith the consuls were, in comparison of them, perfectly inconsiderable,\r\nthey added, that if he did desire the government, he should accept of it\r\nas given by the senate; that he would prosper better, and be happier, if\r\nhe came to it, not by the injustice, but by the good-will of those that\r\nwould bestow it upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. What Things King Agrippa Did For Claudius; And How Claudius\r\nWhen He Had Taken The Government Commanded The Murderers Of Caius To Be\r\nSlain.\r\n\r\n1. Now Claudius, though he was sensible after what an insolent manner\r\nthe senate had sent to him yet did he, according to their advice, behave\r\nhimself for the present with moderation; but not so far that he could\r\nnot recover himself out of his fright; so he was encouraged [to claim\r\nthe government] partly by the boldness of the soldiers, and partly by\r\nthe persuasion of king Agrippa, who exhorted him not to let such a\r\ndominion slip out of his hands, when it came thus to him of its own\r\naccord. Now this Agrippa, with relation to Caius, did what became one\r\nthat had been so much honored by him; for he embraced Caius's body after\r\nhe was dead, and laid it upon a bed, and covered it as well as he could,\r\nand went out to the guards, and told them that Caius was still alive;\r\nbut he said that they should call for physicians, since he was very ill\r\nof his wounds. But when he had learned that Claudius was carried away\r\nviolently by the soldiers, he rushed through the crowd to him, and when\r\nhe found that he was in disorder, and ready to resign up the government\r\nto the senate, he encouraged him, and desired him to keep the\r\ngovernment; but when he had said this to Claudius, he retired home. And\r\nupon the senate's sending for him, he anointed his head with ointment,\r\nas if he had lately accompanied with his wife, and had dismissed her,\r\nand then came to them: he also asked of the senators what Claudius did;\r\nwho told him the present state of affairs, and then asked his opinion\r\nabout the settlement of the public. He told them in words that he was\r\nready to lose his life for the honor of the senate, but desired them to\r\nconsider what was for their advantage, without any regard to what was\r\nmost agreeable to them; for that those who grasp at government will\r\nstand in need of weapons and soldiers to guard them, unless they will\r\nset up without any preparation for it, and so fall into danger. And when\r\nthe senate replied that they would bring in weapons in abundance, and\r\nmoney, and that as to an army, a part of it was already collected\r\ntogether for them, and they would raise a larger one by giving the\r\nslaves their liberty,—Agrippa made answer, \"O senators! may you be able\r\nto compass what you have a mind to; yet will I immediately tell you my\r\nthoughts, because they tend to your preservation. Take notice, then,\r\nthat the army which will fight for Claudius hath been long exercised in\r\nwarlike affairs; but our army will be no better than a rude multitude of\r\nraw men, and those such as have been unexpectedly made free from\r\nslavery, and ungovernable; we must then fight against those that are\r\nskillful in war, with men who know not so much as how to draw their\r\nswords. So that my opinion is, that we should send some persons to\r\nClaudius, to persuade him to lay down the government; and I am ready to\r\nbe one of your ambassadors.\"\r\n\r\n2. Upon this speech of Agrippa, the senate complied with him, and he was\r\nsent among others, and privately informed Claudius of the disorder the\r\nsenate was in, and gave him instructions to answer them in a somewhat\r\ncommanding strain, and as one invested with dignity and authority.\r\nAccordingly, Claudius said to the ambassadors, that he did not wonder\r\nthe senate had no mind to have an emperor over them, because they had\r\nbeen harassed by the barbarity of those that had formerly been at the\r\nhead of their affairs; but that they should taste of an equitable\r\ngovernment under him, and moderate times, while he should only be their\r\nruler in name, but the authority should be equally common to them all;\r\nand since he had passed through many and various scenes of life before\r\ntheir eyes, it would be good for them not to distrust him. So the\r\nambassadors, upon their hearing this his answer, were dismissed. But\r\nClaudius discoursed with the army which was there gathered together, who\r\ntook oaths that they would persist in their fidelity to him; Upon which\r\nhe gave the guards every man five thousand 13 drachmae a-piece, and a\r\nproportionable quantity to their captains, and promised to give the same\r\nto the rest of the armies wheresoever they were.\r\n\r\n3. And now the consuls called the senate together into the temple of\r\nJupiter the Conqueror, while it was still night; but some of those\r\nsenators concealed themselves in the city, being uncertain what to do,\r\nupon the hearing of this summons; and some of them went out of the city\r\nto their own farms, as foreseeing whither the public affairs were going,\r\nand despairing of liberty; nay, these supposed it much better for them\r\nto be slaves without danger to themselves, and to live a lazy and\r\ninactive life, than by claiming the dignity of their forefathers, to run\r\nthe hazard of their own safety. However, a hundred and no more were\r\ngotten together; and as they were in consultation about the present\r\nposture of affairs, a sudden clamor was made by the soldiers that were\r\non their side, desiring that the senate would choose them an emperor,\r\nand not bring the government into ruin by setting up a multitude of\r\nrulers. So they fully declared themselves to be for the giving the\r\ngovernment not to all, but to one; but they gave the senate leave to\r\nlook out for a person worthy to be set over them, insomuch that now the\r\naffairs of the senate were much worse than before, because they had not\r\nonly failed in the recovery of their liberty, which they boasted\r\nthemselves of, but were in dread of Claudius also. Yet were there those\r\nthat hankered after the government, both on account of the dignity of\r\ntheir families and that accruing to them by their marriages; for Marcus\r\nMinucianus was illustrious, both by his own nobility, and by his having\r\nmarried Julia, the sister of Caius, who accordingly was very ready to\r\nclaim the government, although the consuls discouraged him, and made one\r\ndelay after another in proposing it: that Minucianus also, who was one\r\nof Caius's murderers, restrained Valerius of Asia from thinking of such\r\nthings; and a prodigious slaughter there had been, if leave had been\r\ngiven to these men to set up for themselves, and oppose Claudius. There\r\nwere also a considerable number of gladiators besides, and of those\r\nsoldiers who kept watch by night in the city, and rowers of ships, who\r\nall ran into the camp; insomuch that, of those who put in for the\r\ngovernment, some left off their pretensions in order to spare the city,\r\nand others out of fear for their own persons.\r\n\r\n4. But as soon as ever it was day, Cherea, and those that were with him,\r\ncame into the senate, and attempted to make speeches to the soldiers.\r\nHowever, the multitude of those soldiers, when they saw that they were\r\nmaking signals for silence with their hands, and were ready to begin to\r\nspeak to them, grew tumultuous, and would not let them speak at all,\r\nbecause they were all zealous to be under a monarchy; and they demanded\r\nof the senate one for their ruler, as not enduring any longer delays:\r\nbut the senate hesitated about either their own governing, or how they\r\nshould themselves be governed, while the soldiers would not admit them\r\nto govern, and the murderers of Caius would not permit the soldiers to\r\ndictate to them. When they were in these circumstances, Cherea was not\r\nable to contain the anger he had, and promised, that if they desired an\r\nemperor, he would give them one, if any one would bring him the\r\nwatchword from Eutychus. Now this Eutychus was charioteer of the green-\r\nband faction, styled Prasine, and a great friend of Caius, who used to\r\nharass the soldiery with building stables for the horses, and spent his\r\ntime in ignominious labors, which occasioned Cherea to reproach them\r\nwith him, and to abuse them with much other scurrilous language; and\r\ntold them he would bring them the head of Claudius; and that it was an\r\namazing thing, that, after their former madness, they should commit\r\ntheir government to a fool. Yet were not they moved with his words, but\r\ndrew their swords, and took up their ensigns, and went to Claudius, to\r\njoin in taking the oath of fidelity to him. So the senate were left\r\nwithout any body to defend them, and the very consuls differed nothing\r\nfrom private persons. They were also under consternation and sorrow, men\r\nnot knowing what would become of them, because Claudius was very angry\r\nat them; so they fell a reproaching one another, and repented of what\r\nthey had done. At which juncture Sabinus, one of Caius's murderers,\r\nthreatened that he would sooner come into the midst of them and kill\r\nhimself, than consent to make Claudius emperor, and see slavery\r\nreturning upon them; he also abused Cherea for loving his life too well,\r\nwhile he who was the first in his contempt of Caius, could think it a\r\ngood thin to live, when, even by all that they had done for the recovery\r\nof their liberty, they found it impossible to do it. But Cherea said he\r\nhad no manner of doubt upon him about killing himself; that yet he would\r\nfirst sound the intentions of Claudius before he did it.\r\n\r\n5. These were the debates [about the senate]; but in the camp every body\r\nwas crowding on all sides to pay their court to Claudius; and the other\r\nconsul, Quintus Pomponhis, was reproached by the soldiery, as having\r\nrather exhorted the senate to recover their liberty; whereupon they drew\r\ntheir swords, and were going to assault him, and they had done it, if\r\nClaudius had not hindered them, who snatched the consul out of the\r\ndanger he was in, and set him by him. But he did not receive that part\r\nof the senate which was with Quintus in the like honorable manner; nay,\r\nsome of them received blows, and were thrust away as they came to salute\r\nClaudius; nay, Aponius went away wounded, and they were all in danger.\r\nHowever, king Agrippa went up to Claudius, and desired he would treat\r\nthe senators more gently; for if any mischief should come to the senate,\r\nhe would have no others over whom to rule. Claudius complied with him,\r\nand called the senate together into the palace, and was carried thither\r\nhimself through the city, while the soldiery conducted him, though this\r\nwas to the great vexation of the multitude; for Cherea and Sabinus, two\r\nof Caius's murderers, went in the fore-front of them, in an open manner,\r\nwhile Pollio, whom Claudius, a little before, had made captain of his\r\nguards, had sent them an epistolary edict, to forbid them to appear in\r\npublic. Then did Claudius, upon his coming to the palace, get his\r\nfriends together, and desired their suffrages about Cherea. They said\r\nthat the work he had done was a glorious one; but they accused him that\r\nhe did it of perfidiousness, and thought it just to inflict the\r\npunishment [of death] upon him, to discountenance such actions for the\r\ntime to come. So Cherea was led to his execution, and Lupus and many\r\nother Romans with him. Now it is reported that Cherea bore this calamity\r\ncourageously; and this not only by the firmness of his own behavior\r\nunder it, but by the reproaches he laid upon Lupus, who fell into tears;\r\nfor when Lupus laid his garment aside, and complained of the cold 14 he\r\nsaid, that cold was never hurtful to Lupus [i.e. a wolf] And as a great\r\nmany men went along with them to see the sight, when Cherea came to the\r\nplace, he asked the soldier who was to be their executioner, whether\r\nthis office was what he was used to, or whether this was the first time\r\nof his using his sword in that manner, and desired him to bring him that\r\nvery sword with which he himself slew Caius. 15 So he was happily killed\r\nat one stroke. But Lupus did not meet with such good fortune in going\r\nout of the world, since he was timorous, and had many blows leveled at\r\nhis neck, because he did not stretch it out boldly [as he ought to have\r\ndone].\r\n\r\n6. Now, a few days after this, as the Parental solemnities were just at\r\nhand, the Roman multitude made their usual oblations to their several\r\nghosts, and put portions into the fire in honor of Cherea, and besought\r\nhim to be merciful to them, and not continue his anger against them for\r\ntheir ingratitude. And this was the end of the life that Cherea came to.\r\nBut for Sabinus, although Claudius not only set him at liberty, but gave\r\nhim leave to retain his former command in the army, yet did he think it\r\nwould be unjust in him to fail of performing his obligations to his\r\nfellow confederates; so he fell upon his sword, and killed himself, the\r\nwound reaching up to the very hilt of the sword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. How Claudius Restored To Agrippa His Grandfathers Kingdoms\r\nAnd Augmented His Dominions; And How He Published An Edict In Behalf.\r\n\r\n1. Now when Claudius had taken out of the way all those soldiers whom he\r\nsuspected, which he did immediately, he published an edict, and therein\r\nconfirmed that kingdom to Agrippa which Caius had given him, and therein\r\ncommended the king highly. He also made all addition to it of all that\r\ncountry over which Herod, who was his grandfather, had reigned, that is,\r\nJudea and Samaria; and this he restored to him as due to his family. But\r\nfor Abila 16 of Lysanias, and all that lay at Mount Libanus, he bestowed\r\nthem upon him, as out of his own territories. He also made a league with\r\nthis Agrippa, confirmed by oaths, in the middle of the forum, in the\r\ncity of Rome: he also took away from Antiochus that kingdom which he was\r\npossessed of, but gave him a certain part of Cilicia and Commagena: he\r\nalso set Alexander Lysimachus, the alabarch, at liberty, who had been\r\nhis old friend, and steward to his mother Antonia, but had been\r\nimprisoned by Caius, whose son [Marcus] married Bernice, the daughter of\r\nAgrippa. But when Marcus, Alexander's son, was dead, who had married her\r\nwhen she was a virgin, Agrippa gave her in marriage to his brother\r\nHerod, and begged for him of Claudius the kingdom of Chalcis.\r\n\r\n2. Now about this time there was a sedition between the Jews and the\r\nGreeks, at the city of Alexandria; for when Caius was dead, the nation\r\nof the Jews, which had been very much mortified under the reign of\r\nCaius, and reduced to very great distress by the people of Alexandria,\r\nrecovered itself, and immediately took up their arms to fight for\r\nthemselves. So Claudius sent an order to the president of Egypt to quiet\r\nthat tumult; he also sent an edict, at the requests of king Agrippa and\r\nking Herod, both to Alexandria and to Syria, whose contents were as\r\nfollows: \"Tiberius Claudius Cæsar Augustus Germanicus, high priest, and\r\ntribune of the people, ordains thus: Since I am assured that the Jews of\r\nAlexandria, called Alexandrians, have been joint inhabitants in the\r\nearliest times with the Alexandrians, and have obtained from their kings\r\nequal privileges with them, as is evident by the public records that are\r\nin their possession, and the edicts themselves; and that after\r\nAlexandria had been subjected to our empire by Augustus, their rights\r\nand privileges have been preserved by those presidents who have at\r\ndivers times been sent thither; and that no dispute had been raised\r\nabout those rights and privileges, even when Aquila was governor of\r\nAlexandria; and that when the Jewish ethnarch was dead, Augustus did not\r\nprohibit the making such ethnarchs, as willing that all men should be so\r\nsubject [to the Romans] as to continue in the observation of their own\r\ncustoms, and not be forced to transgress the ancient rules of their own\r\ncountry religion; but that, in the time of Caius, the Alexandrians\r\nbecame insolent towards the Jews that were among them, which Caius, out\r\nof his great madness and want of understanding, reduced the nation of\r\nthe Jews very low, because they would not transgress the religious\r\nworship of their country, and call him a god: I will therefore that the\r\nnation of the Jews be not deprived of their rights and privileges, on\r\naccount of the madness of Caius; but that those rights and privileges\r\nwhich they formerly enjoyed be preserved to them, and that they may\r\ncontinue in their own customs. And I charge both parties to take very\r\ngreat care that no troubles may arise after the promulgation of this\r\nedict.\"\r\n\r\n3. And such were the contents of this edict on behalf of the Jews that\r\nwas sent to Alexandria. But the edict that was sent into the other parts\r\nof the habitable earth was this which follows: \"Tiberius Claudius Cæsar\r\nAugustus Germanicus, high priest, tribune of the people, chosen consul\r\nthe second time, ordains thus: Upon the petition of king Agrippa and\r\nking Herod, who are persons very dear to me, that I would grant the same\r\nrights and privileges should be preserved to the Jews which are in all\r\nthe Roman empire, which I have granted to those of Alexandria, I very\r\nwillingly comply therewith; and this grant I make not only for the sake\r\nof the petitioners, but as judging those Jews for whom I have been\r\npetitioned worthy of such a favor, on account of their fidelity and\r\nfriendship to the Romans. I think it also very just that no Grecian city\r\nshould be deprived of such rights and privileges, since they were\r\npreserved to them under the great Augustus. It will therefore be fit to\r\npermit the Jews, who are in all the world under us, to keep their\r\nancient customs without being hindered so to do. And I do charge them\r\nalso to use this my kindness to them with moderation, and not to show a\r\ncontempt of the superstitious observances of other nations, but to keep\r\ntheir own laws only. And I will that this decree of mine be engraven on\r\ntables by the magistrates of the cities, and colonies, and municipal\r\nplaces, both those within Italy and those without it, both kings and\r\ngovernors, by the means of the ambassadors, and to have them exposed to\r\nthe public for full thirty days, in such a place whence it may plainly\r\nbe read from the ground.\" 17\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. What Things Were Done By Agrippa At Jerusalem When He Was\r\nReturned Back Into Judea; And What It Was That Petronius Wrote To The\r\nInhabitants Of Doris, In Behalf.\r\n\r\n1. Now Claudius Cæsar, by these decrees of his which were sent to\r\nAlexandria, and to all the habitable earth, made known what opinion he\r\nhad of the Jews. So he soon sent Agrippa away to take his kingdom, now\r\nhe was advanced to a more illustrious dignity than before, and sent\r\nletters to the presidents and procurators of the provinces that they\r\nshould treat him very kindly. Accordingly, he returned in haste, as was\r\nlikely he would, now he returned in much greater prosperity than he had\r\nbefore. He also came to Jerusalem, and offered all the sacrifices that\r\nbelonged to him, and omitted nothing which the law required; 18 on which\r\naccount he ordained that many of the Nazarites should have their heads\r\nshorn. And for the golden chain which had been given him by Caius, of\r\nequal weight with that iron chain wherewith his royal hands had been\r\nbound, he hung it up within the limits of the temple, over the treasury,\r\n19 that it might be a memorial of the severe fate he had lain under, and\r\na testimony of his change for the better; that it might be a\r\ndemonstration how the greatest prosperity may have a fall, and that God\r\nsometimes raises up what is fallen down: for this chain thus dedicated\r\nafforded a document to all men, that king Agrippa had been once bound in\r\na chain for a small cause, but recovered his former dignity again; and a\r\nlittle while afterward got out of his bonds, and was advanced to be a\r\nmore illustrious king than he was before. Whence men may understand that\r\nall that partake of human nature, how great soever they are, may fall;\r\nand that those that fall may gain their former illustrious dignity\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n2. And when Agrippa had entirely finished all the duties of the Divine\r\nworship, he removed Theophilus, the son of Ananus, from the high\r\npriesthood, and bestowed that honor of his on Simon the son of Boethus,\r\nwhose name was also Cantheras whose daughter king Herod married, as I\r\nhave related above. Simon, therefore, had the [high] priesthood with his\r\nbrethren, and with his father, in like manner as the sons of Simon, the\r\nson of Onias, who were three, had it formerly under the government of\r\nthe Macedonians, as we have related in a former book.\r\n\r\n3. When the king had settled the high priesthood after this manner, he\r\nreturned the kindness which the inhabitants of Jerusalem had showed him;\r\nfor he released them from the tax upon houses, every one of which paid\r\nit before, thinking it a good thing to requite the tender affection of\r\nthose that loved him. He also made Silas the general of his forces, as a\r\nman who had partaken with him in many of his troubles. But after a very\r\nlittle while the young men of Doris, preferring a rash attempt before\r\npiety, and being naturally bold and insolent, carried a statue of Cæsar\r\ninto a synagogue of the Jews, and erected it there. This procedure of\r\ntheirs greatly provoked Agrippa; for it plainly tended to the\r\ndissolution of the laws of his country. So he came without delay to\r\nPublius Petronius, who was then president of Syria, and accused the\r\npeople of Doris. Nor did he less resent what was done than did Agrippa;\r\nfor he judged it a piece of impiety to transgress the laws that regulate\r\nthe actions of men. So he wrote the following letter to the people of\r\nDoris in an angry strain: \"Publius Petronius, the president under\r\nTiberius Claudius Cæsar Augustus Germanicus, to the magistrates of\r\nDoris, ordains as follows: Since some of you have had the boldness, or\r\nmadness rather, after the edict of Claudius Cæsar Augustus Germanicus\r\nwas published, for permitting the Jews to observe the laws of their\r\ncountry, not to obey the same, but have acted in entire opposition\r\nthereto, as forbidding the Jews to assemble together in the synagogue,\r\nby removing Cæsar's statue, and setting it up therein, and thereby have\r\noffended not only the Jews, but the emperor himself, whose statue is\r\nmore commodiously placed in his own temple than in a foreign one, where\r\nis the place of assembling together; while it is but a part of natural\r\njustice, that every one should have the power over the place belonging\r\npeculiarly to themselves, according to the determination of Cæsar,—to\r\nsay nothing of my own determination, which it would be ridiculous to\r\nmention after the emperor's edict, which gives the Jews leave to make\r\nuse of their own customs, as also gives order that they enjoy equally\r\nthe rights of citizens with the Greeks themselves,—I therefore ordain\r\nthat Proculus Vitellius, the centurion, bring those men to me, who,\r\ncontrary to Augustus's edict, have been so insolent as to do this thing,\r\nat which those very men, who appear to be of principal reputation among\r\nthem, have an indignation also, and allege for themselves, 'that it was\r\nnot done with their consent, but by the violence of the multitude, that\r\nthey may give an account of what hath been done. I also exhort the\r\nprincipal magistrates among them, unless they have a mind to have this\r\naction esteemed to be done with their consent, to inform the centurion\r\nof those that were guilty of it, and take care that no handle be hence\r\ntaken for raising a sedition or quarrel among them; which those seem to\r\nme to treat after who encourage such doings; while both I myself, and\r\nking Agrippa, for whom I have the highest honor, have nothing more under\r\nour care, than that the nation of the Jews may have no occasion given\r\nthem of getting together, under the pretense of avenging themselves, and\r\nbecome tumultuous. And that it may be more publicly known what Augustus\r\nhath resolved about this whole matter, I have subjoined those edicts\r\nwhich he hath lately caused to be published at Alexandria, and which,\r\nalthough they may be well known to all, yet did king Agrippa, for whom I\r\nhave the highest honor, read them at that time before my tribunal, and\r\npleaded that the Jews ought not to be deprived of those rights which\r\nAugustus hath granted them. I therefore charge you, that you do not, for\r\nthe time to come, seek for any occasion of sedition or disturbance, but\r\nthat every one be allowed to follow their own religious customs.\"\r\n\r\n4. Thus did Petronius take care of this matter, that such a breach of\r\nthe law might be corrected, and that no such thing might be attempted\r\nafterwards against the Jews. And now king Agrippa took the [high]\r\npriesthood away from Simon Cantheras, and put Jonathan, the son of\r\nAnanus, into it again, and owned that he was more worthy of that dignity\r\nthan the other. But this was not a thing acceptable to him, to recover\r\nthat his former dignity. So he refused it, and said, \"O king! I rejoice\r\nin the honor that thou hast for me, and take it kindly that thou wouldst\r\ngive me such a dignity of thy own inclinations, although God hath judged\r\nthat I am not at all worthy of the high priesthood. I am satisfied with\r\nhaving once put on the sacred garments; for I then put them on after a\r\nmore holy manner than I should now receive them again. But if thou\r\ndesirest that a person more worthy than myself should have this\r\nhonorable employment, give me leave to name thee such a one. I have a\r\nbrother that is pure from all sin against God, and of all offenses\r\nagainst thyself; I recommend him to thee, as one that is fit for this\r\ndignity.\" So the king was pleased with these words of his, and passed by\r\nJonathan, and, according to his brother's desire, bestowed the high\r\npriesthood upon Matthias. Nor was it long before Marcus succeeded\r\nPetronius, as president of Syria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. Concerning Silas And On What Account It Was That King Agrippa\r\nWas Angry At Him. How Agrippa Began To Encompass Jerusalem With A Wall;\r\nAnd What Benefits He Bestowed On The Inhabitants Of Berytus.\r\n\r\n1. Now Silas, the general of the king's horse, because he had been\r\nfaithful to him under all his misfortunes, and had never refused to be a\r\npartaker with him in any of his dangers, but had oftentimes undergone\r\nthe most hazardous dangers for him, was full of assurance, and thought\r\nhe might expect a sort of equality with the king, on account of the\r\nfirmness of the friendship he had showed to him. Accordingly, he would\r\nno where let the king sit as his superior, and took the like liberty in\r\nspeaking to him upon all occasions, till he became troublesome to the\r\nking, when they were merry together, extolling himself beyond measure,\r\nand oft putting the king in mind of the severity of fortune he had\r\nundergone, that he might, by way of ostentation, demonstrate What zeal\r\nhe had showed in his service; and was continually harping upon this\r\nstring, what pains he had taken for him, and much enlarged still upon\r\nthat subject. The repetition of this so frequently seemed to reproach\r\nthe king, insomuch that he took this ungovernable liberty of talking\r\nvery ill at his hands. For the commemoration of times when men have been\r\nunder ignominy, is by no means agreeable to them; and he is a very silly\r\nman who is perpetually relating to a person what kindness he had done\r\nhim. At last, therefore, Silas had so thoroughly provoked the king's\r\nindignation, that he acted rather out of passion than good\r\nconsideration, and did not only turn Silas out of his place, as general\r\nof his horse, but sent him in bonds into his own country. But the edge\r\nof his anger wore off by length of time, and made room for more just\r\nreasonings as to his judgment about this man; and he considered how many\r\nlabors he had undergone for his sake. So when Agrippa was solemnizing\r\nhis birth-day, and he gave festival entertainments to all his subjects,\r\nhe sent for Silas on the sudden to be his guest. But as he was a very\r\nfrank man, he thought he had now a just handle given him to be angry;\r\nwhich he could not conceal from those that came for him, but said to\r\nthem, \"What honor is this the king invites me to, which I conclude will\r\nsoon be over? For the king hath not let me keep those original marks of\r\nthe good-will I bore him, which I once had from him; but he hath\r\nplundered me, and that unjustly also. Does he think that I can leave off\r\nthat liberty of speech, which, upon the consciousness of my deserts, I\r\nshall use more loudly than before, and shall relate how many misfortunes\r\nI have been delivered from; how many labors I have undergone for him,\r\nwhereby I procured him deliverance and respect; as a reward for which I\r\nhave borne the hardships of bonds and a dark prison? I shall never\r\nforget this usage. Nay, perhaps, my very soul, when it is departed out\r\nof the body, will not forget the glorious actions I did on his account.\"\r\nThis was the clamor he made, and he ordered the messengers to tell it to\r\nthe king. So he perceived that Silas was incurable in his folly, and\r\nstill suffered him to lie in prison.\r\n\r\n2. As for the walls of Jerusalem, that were adjoining to the new city\r\n[Bezetha], he repaired them at the expense of the public, and built them\r\nwider in breadth, and higher in altitude; and he had made them too\r\nstrong for all human power to demolish, unless Marcus, the then\r\npresident of Syria, had by letter informed Claudius Cæsar of what he was\r\ndoing. And when Claudius had some suspicion of attempts for innovation,\r\nhe sent to Agrippa to leave off the building of those walls presently.\r\nSo he obeyed, as not thinking it proper to contradict Claudius.\r\n\r\n3. Now this king was by nature very beneficent and liberal in his gifts,\r\nand very ambitious to oblige people with such large donations; and he\r\nmade himself very illustrious by the many chargeable presents he made\r\nthem. He took delight in giving, and rejoiced in living with good\r\nreputation. He was not at all like that Herod who reigned before him;\r\nfor that Herod was ill-natured, and severe in his punishments, and had\r\nno mercy on them that he hated; and every one perceived that he was more\r\nfriendly to the Greeks than to the Jews; for he adorned foreign cities\r\nwith large presents in money; with building them baths and theatres\r\nbesides; nay, in some of those places he erected temples, and porticoes\r\nin others; but he did not vouchsafe to raise one of the least edifices\r\nin any Jewish city, or make them any donation that was worth mentioning.\r\nBut Agrippa's temper was mild, and equally liberal to all men. He was\r\nhumane to foreigners, and made them sensible of his liberality. He was\r\nin like manner rather of a gentle and compassionate temper. Accordingly,\r\nhe loved to live continually at Jerusalem, and was exactly careful in\r\nthe observance of the laws of his country. He therefore kept himself\r\nentirely pure; nor did any day pass over his head without its appointed\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n4. However, there was a certain mall of the Jewish nation at Jerusalem,\r\nwho appeared to be very accurate in the knowledge of the law. His name\r\nwas Simon. This man got together an assembly, while the king was absent\r\nat Cæsarea, and had the insolence to accuse him as not living holily,\r\nand that he might justly be excluded out of the temple, since it\r\nbelonged only to native Jews. But the general of Agrippa's army informed\r\nhim that Simon had made such a speech to the people. So the king sent\r\nfor him; and as he was sitting in the theater, he bid him sit down by\r\nhim, and said to him with a low and gentle voice, \"What is there done in\r\nthis place that is contrary to the law?\" But he had nothing to say for\r\nhimself, but begged his pardon. So the king was more easily reconciled\r\nto him than one could have imagined, as esteeming mildness a better\r\nquality in a king than anger, and knowing that moderation is more\r\nbecoming in great men than passion. So he made Simon a small present,\r\nand dismissed him.\r\n\r\n5. Now as Agrippa was a great builder in many places, he paid a peculiar\r\nregard to the people of Berytus; for he erected a theater for them,\r\nsuperior to many others of that sort, both in Sumptuousness and\r\nelegance, as also an amphitheater, built at vast expenses; and besides\r\nthese, he built them baths and porticoes, and spared for no costs in any\r\nof his edifices, to render them both handsome and large. He also spent a\r\ngreat deal upon their dedication, and exhibited shows upon them, and\r\nbrought thither musicians of all sorts, and such as made the most\r\ndelightful music of the greatest variety. He also showed his\r\nmagnificence upon the theater, in his great number of gladiators; and\r\nthere it was that he exhibited the several antagonists, in order to\r\nplease the spectators; no fewer indeed than seven hundred men to fight\r\nwith seven hundred other men 20 and allotted all the malefactors he had\r\nfor this exercise, that both the malefactors might receive their\r\npunishment, and that this operation of war might be a recreation in\r\npeace. And thus were these criminals all destroyed at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. What Other Acts Were Done By Agrippa Until His Death; And\r\nAfter What Manner He Died.\r\n\r\n1. When Agrippa had finished what I have above related at Berytus, he\r\nremoved to Tiberias, a city of Galilee. Now he was in great esteem among\r\nother kings. Accordingly there came to him Antiochus, king of Commalena,\r\nSampsigeratnus, king of Emesa, and Cotys, who was king of the Lesser\r\nArmenia, and Polemo, who was king of Pontus, as also Herod his brother,\r\nwho was king of Chalcis. All these he treated with agreeable\r\nentertainments, and after an obliging manner, and so as to exhibit the\r\ngreatness of his mind, and so as to appear worthy of those respects\r\nwhich the kings paid to him, by coming thus to see him. However, while\r\nthese kings staid with him, Marcus, the president of Syria, came\r\nthither. So the king, in order to preserve the respect that was due to\r\nthe Romans, went out of the city to meet him, as far as seven furlongs.\r\nBut this proved to be the beginning of a difference between him and\r\nMarcus; for he took with him in his chariot those other kings as his\r\nassessors. But Marcus had a suspicion what the meaning could be of so\r\ngreat a friendship of these kings one with another, and did not think so\r\nclose an agreement of so many potentates to be for the interest of the\r\nRomans. He therefore sent some of his domestics to every one of them,\r\nand enjoined them to go their ways home without further delay. This was\r\nvery ill taken by Agrippa, who after that became his enemy. And now he\r\ntook the high priesthood away from Matthias, and made Elioneus, the son\r\nof Cantheras, high priest in his stead.\r\n\r\n2. Now when Agrippa had reigned three years over all Judea, he came to\r\nthe city Cæsarea, which was formerly called Strato's Tower; and there he\r\nexhibited shows in honor of Cæsar, upon his being informed that there\r\nwas a certain festival celebrated to make vows for his safety. At which\r\nfestival a great multitude was gotten together of the principal persons,\r\nand such as were of dignity through his province. On the second day of\r\nwhich shows he put on a garment made wholly of silver, and of a\r\ncontexture truly wonderful, and came into the theater early in the\r\nmorning; at which time the silver of his garment being illuminated by\r\nthe fresh reflection of the sun's rays upon it, shone out after a\r\nsurprising manner, and was so resplendent as to spread a horror over\r\nthose that looked intently upon him; and presently his flatterers cried\r\nout, one from one place, and another from another, [though not for his\r\ngood,] that he was a god; and they added, \"Be thou merciful to us; for\r\nalthough we have hitherto reverenced thee only as a man, yet shall we\r\nhenceforth own thee as superior to mortal nature.\" Upon this the king\r\ndid neither rebuke them, nor reject their impious flattery. But as he\r\npresently afterward looked up, he saw an owl 21 sitting on a certain\r\nrope over his head, and immediately understood that this bird was the\r\nmessenger of ill tidings, as it had once been the messenger of good\r\ntidings to him; and fell into the deepest sorrow. A severe pain also\r\narose in his belly, and began in a most violent manner. He therefore\r\nlooked upon his friends, and said, \"I, whom you call a god, am commanded\r\npresently to depart this life; while Providence thus reproves the lying\r\nwords you just now said to me; and I, who was by you called immortal, am\r\nimmediately to be hurried away by death. But I am bound to accept of\r\nwhat Providence allots, as it pleases God; for we have by no means lived\r\nill, but in a splendid and happy manner.\" When he said this, his pain\r\nwas become violent. Accordingly he was carried into the palace, and the\r\nrumor went abroad every where, that he would certainly die in a little\r\ntime. But the multitude presently sat in sackcloth, with their wives and\r\nchildren, after the law of their country, and besought God for the\r\nking's recovery. All places were also full of mourning and lamentation.\r\nNow the king rested in a high chamber, and as he saw them below lying\r\nprostrate on the ground, he could not himself forbear weeping. And when\r\nhe had been quite worn out by the pain in his belly for five days, he\r\ndeparted this life, being in the fifty-fourth year of his age, and in\r\nthe seventh year of his reign; for he reigned four years under Caius\r\nCæsar, three of them were over Philip's tetrarchy only, and on the\r\nfourth he had that of Herod added to it; and he reigned, besides those,\r\nthree years under the reign of Claudius Cæsar; in which time he reigned\r\nover the forementioned countries, and also had Judea added to them, as\r\nwell as Samaria and Cæsarea. The revenues that he received out of them\r\nwere very great, no less than twelve millions of drachmae. 22 Yet did he\r\nborrow great sums from others; for he was so very liberal that his\r\nexpenses exceeded his incomes, and his generosity was boundless. 23\r\n\r\n3. But before the multitude were made acquainted with Agrippa's being\r\nexpired, Herod the king of Chalcis, and Helcias the master of his horse,\r\nand the king's friend, sent Aristo, one of the king's most faithful\r\nservants, and slew Silas, who had been their enemy, as if it had been\r\ndone by the king's own command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. What Things Were Done After The Death Of Agrippa; And How\r\nClaudius, On Account Of The Youth And Unskilfulness Of Agrippa, Junior,\r\nSent Cuspius Fadus To Be Procurator Of Judea, And Of The Entire Kingdom.\r\n\r\n1. And thus did king Agrippa depart this life. But he left behind him a\r\nson, Agrippa by name, a youth in the seventeenth year of his age, and\r\nthree daughters; one of which, Bernice, was married to Herod, his\r\nfather's brother, and was sixteen years old; the other two, Mariamne and\r\nDrusilla, were still virgins; the former was ten years old, and Drusilla\r\nsix. Now these his daughters were thus espoused by their father;\r\nMarlatone to Julius Archelaus Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus, the son\r\nof Chelcias; and Drusilla to the king of Commagena. But when it was\r\nknown that Agrippa was departed this life, the inhabitants of Cæsarea\r\nand of Sebaste forgot the kindnesses he had bestowed on them, and acted\r\nthe part of the bitterest enemies; for they cast such reproaches upon\r\nthe deceased as are not fit to be spoken of; and so many of them as were\r\nthen soldiers, which were a great number, went to his house, and hastily\r\ncarried off the statues 24 of this king's daughters, and all at once\r\ncarried them into the brothel-houses, and when they had set them on the\r\ntops of those houses, they abused them to the utmost of their power, and\r\ndid such things to them as are too indecent to be related. They also\r\nlaid themselves down in public places, and celebrated general feastings,\r\nwith garlands on their heads, and with ointments and libations to\r\nCharon, and drinking to one another for joy that the king was expired.\r\nNay, they were not only unmindful of Agrippa, who had extended his\r\nliberality to them in abundance, but of his grandfather Herod also, who\r\nhad himself rebuilt their cities, and had raised them havens and temples\r\nat vast expenses.\r\n\r\n2. Now Agrippa, the son of the deceased, was at Rome, and brought up\r\nwith Claudius Cæsar. And when Cæsar was informed that Agrippa was dead,\r\nand that the inhabitants of Sebaste and Cæsarea had abused him, he was\r\nsorry for the first news, and was displeased with the ingratitude of\r\nthose cities. He was therefore disposed to send Agrippa, junior, away\r\npresently to succeed his father in the kingdom, and was willing to\r\nconfirm him in it by his oath. But those freed-men and friends of his,\r\nwho had the greatest authority with him, dissuaded him from it, and said\r\nthat it was a dangerous experiment to permit so large a kingdom to come\r\nunder the government of so very young a man, and one hardly yet arrived\r\nat years of discretion, who would not be able to take sufficient care of\r\nits administration; while the weight of a kingdom is heavy enough to a\r\ngrown man. So Cæsar thought what they said to be reasonable. Accordingly\r\nhe sent Cuspins Fadus to be procurator of Judea, and of the entire\r\nkingdom, and paid that respect to the deceased as not to introduce\r\nMarcus, who had been at variance with him, into his kingdom. But he\r\ndetermined, in the first place, to send orders to Fadus, that he should\r\nchastise the inhabitants of Cæsarea and Sebaste for those abuses they\r\nhad offered to him that was deceased, and their madness towards his\r\ndaughters that were still alive; and that he should remove that body of\r\nsoldiers that were at Cæsarea and Sebaste, with the five regiments, into\r\nPontus, that they might do their military duty there; and that he should\r\nchoose an equal number of soldiers out of the Roman legions that were in\r\nSyria, to supply their place. Yet were not those that had such orders\r\nactually removed; for by sending ambassadors to Claudius, they mollified\r\nhim, and got leave to abide in Judea still; and these were the very men\r\nthat became the source of very great calamities to the Jews in after-\r\ntimes, and sowed the seeds of that war which began under Florus; whence\r\nit was that when Vespasian had subdued the country, he removed them out\r\nof his province, as we shall relate hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ In this and the three next chapters we have, I think, a\r\nlarger and more distinct account of the slaughter of Caius, and the\r\nsuccession of Claudius, than we have of any such ancient facts\r\nwhatsoever elsewhere. Some of the occasions of which probably were,\r\nJosephus's bitter hatred against tyranny, and the pleasure he took in\r\ngiving the history of the slaughter of such a barbarous tyrant as was\r\nthis Caius Caligula, as also the deliverance his own nation had by that\r\nslaughter, of which he speaks sect. 2, together with the great intimacy\r\nhe had with Agrippa, junior, whose father was deeply concerned in the\r\nadvancement of Claudius, upon the death of Caius; from which Agrippa,\r\njunior, Josephus might be fully informed Of his history.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ Called Caligula by the Romans.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ Just such a voice as this is related to be came, and from\r\nan unknown original also, to the famous Polycarp, as he was going to\r\nmartyrdom, bidding him \"play the man;\" as the church of Smyrna assures\r\nus in their account of that his martyrdom, sect. 9.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ Here Josephus supposes that it was Augustus, and not Julius\r\nCæsar, who first changed the Roman commonwealth into a monarchy; for\r\nthese shows were in honor of Augustus, as we shall learn in the next\r\nsection.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 (return) [ Suetonius says Caius was slain about the seventh hour of\r\nthe day, the ninth. The series of the narration favors Josephus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 (return) [ The rewards proposed by the Roman laws to informers was\r\nsometimes an eighth part as Spanheim assures us, from the criminal's\r\ngoods, as here, and sometimes a fourth part.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 (return) [ These consuls are named in the War of the Jews, B. II. ch.\r\n11. sect; 1, Sentius Saturninus and Pomponius Secundus, as Spanheim\r\nnotes here.

He notes further, that Suetonius omits the mention of the haven\r\nfor ships, which our author esteems the only public work for the good of\r\nthe present and future ages which Caius left behind him, though in an\r\nimperfect condition.]\r\n\r\n\r\n11 (return) [ This Caius was the son of that excellent person\r\nGermanicus, who was the son of Drusus, the brother of Tiberius the\r\nemperor.

Yet might Josephus\r\nhave this number from Agrippa, junior, though I doubt the thousands, or\r\nat least the hundreds, have been added by the transcribers, of which we\r\nhave had several examples already in Josephus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14 (return) [ This piercing cold here complained of by Lupus agrees well\r\nto the time of the year when Claudius began his reign; it being for\r\ncertain about the months of November, December, or January, and most\r\nprobably a few days after January the twenty-fourth, and a few days\r\nbefore the Roman Parentalia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15 (return) [ It is both here and elsewhere very remarkable, that the\r\nmurders of the vilest tyrants, who yet highly deserved to die, when\r\nthose murderers were under oaths, or other the like obligations of\r\nfidelity to them, were usually revenged, and the murderers were cut off\r\nthemselves, and that after a remarkable manner; and this sometimes, as\r\nin the present case, by those very persons who were not sorry for such\r\nmurders, but got kingdoms by them. The examples are very numerous, both\r\nin sacred and profane histories, and seem generally indications of\r\nDivine vengeance on such murderers. Nor is it unworthy of remark, that\r\nsuch murderers of tyrants do it usually on such ill principles, in such\r\na cruel manner, and as ready to involve the innocent with the guilty,\r\nwhich was the case here, ch. 1. sect. 14, and ch. 2. sect. 4, as justly\r\ndeserved the Divine vengeance upon them.

Containing The Interval Of Twenty-Two Years.—From Fadus The\r\nProcurator To Florus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1. A Sedition Of The Philadelphians Against The Jews; And Also\r\nConcerning The Vestments Of The High Priest.\r\n\r\n1. Upon the death of king Agrippa, which we have related in the\r\nforegoing book, Claudius Cæsar sent Cassius Longinus as successor to\r\nMarcus, out of regard to the memory of king Agrippa, who had often\r\ndesired of him by letters, while he was alive, that he would not suffer\r\nMarcus to be any longer president of Syria. But Fadus, as soon as he was\r\ncome procurator into Judea, found quarrelsome doings between the Jews\r\nthat dwelt in Perea, and the people of Philadelphia, about their\r\nborders, at a village called Mia, that was filled with men of a warlike\r\ntemper; for the Jews of Perea had taken up arms without the consent of\r\ntheir principal men, and had destroyed many of the Philadelphians. When\r\nFadus was informed of this procedure, it provoked him very much that\r\nthey had not left the determination of the matter to him, if they\r\nthought that the Philadelphians had done them any wrong, but had rashly\r\ntaken up arms against them. So he seized upon three of their principal\r\nmen, who were also the causes of this sedition, and ordered them to be\r\nbound, and afterwards had one of them slain, whose name was Hannibal;\r\nand he banished the other two, Areram and Eleazar. Tholomy also, the\r\narch robber, was, after some time, brought to him bound, and slain, but\r\nnot till he had done a world of mischief to Idumea and the Arabians. And\r\nindeed, from that time, Judea was cleared of robberies by the care and\r\nprovidence of Fadus. He also at this time sent for the high priests and\r\nthe principal citizens of Jerusalem, and this at the command of the\r\nemperor, and admonished them that they should lay up the long garment\r\nand the sacred vestment, which it is customary for nobody but the high\r\npriest to wear, in the tower of Antonia, that it might be under the\r\npower of the Romans, as it had been formerly. Now the Jews durst not\r\ncontradict what he had said, but desired Fadus, however, and Longinus,\r\n[which last was come to Jerusalem, and had brought a great army with\r\nhim, out of a fear that the [rigid] injunctions of Fadus should force\r\nthe Jews to rebel,] that they might, in the first place, have leave to\r\nsend ambassadors to Cæsar, to petition him that they may have the holy\r\nvestments under their own power; and that, in the next place, they would\r\ntarry till they knew what answer Claudius would give to that their\r\nrequest. So they replied, that they would give them leave to send their\r\nambassadors, provided they would give them their sons as pledges [for\r\ntheir peaceable behavior]. And when they had agreed so to do, and had\r\ngiven them the pledges they desired, the ambassadors were sent\r\naccordingly. But when, upon their coming to Rome, Agrippa, junior, the\r\nson of the deceased, understood the reason why they came, [for he dwelt\r\nwith Claudius Cæsar, as we said before,] he besought Cæsar to grant the\r\nJews their request about the holy vestments, and to send a message to\r\nFadus accordingly.\r\n\r\n2. Hereupon Claudius called for the ambassadors; and told them that he\r\ngranted their request; and bade them to return their thanks to Agrippa\r\nfor this favor, which had been bestowed on them upon his entreaty. And\r\nbesides these answers of his, he sent the following letter by them:\r\n\"Claudius Cæsar Germanicus, tribune of the people the fifth time, and\r\ndesigned consul the fourth time, and imperator the tenth time, the\r\nfather of his country, to the magistrates, senate, and people, and the\r\nwhole nation of the Jews, sendeth greeting. Upon the presentation of\r\nyour ambassadors to me by Agrippa, my friend, whom I have brought up,\r\nand have now with me, and who is a person of very great piety, who are\r\ncome to give me thanks for the care I have taken of your nation, and to\r\nentreat me, in an earnest and obliging manner, that they may have the\r\nholy vestments, with the crown belonging to them, under their power,—I\r\ngrant their request, as that excellent person Vitellius, who is very\r\ndear to me, had done before me. And I have complied with your desire, in\r\nthe first place, out of regard to that piety which I profess, and\r\nbecause I would have every one worship God according to the laws of\r\ntheir own country; and this I do also because I shall hereby highly\r\ngratify king Herod, and Agrippa, junior, whose sacred regards to me, and\r\nearnest good-will to you, I am well acquainted with, and with whom I\r\nhave the greatest friendship, and whom I highly esteem, and look on as\r\npersons of the best character. Now I have written about these affairs to\r\nCuspius Fadus, my procurator. The names of those that brought me your\r\nletter are Cornelius, the son of Cero, Trypho, the son of Theudio,\r\nDorotheus, the son of Nathaniel, and John, the son of Jotre. This letter\r\nis dated before the fourth of the calends of July, when Ruffis and\r\nPompeius Sylvanus are consuls.\"\r\n\r\n3. Herod also, the brother of the deceased Agrippa, who was then\r\npossessed of the royal authority over Chalcis, petitioned Claudius Cæsar\r\nfor the authority over the temple, and the money of the sacred treasure,\r\nand the choice of the high priests, and obtained all that he petitioned\r\nfor. So that after that time this authority continued among all his\r\ndescendants till the end of the war 1 Accordingly, Herod removed the\r\nlast high priest, called Cimtheras, and bestowed that dignity on his\r\nsuccessor Joseph, the son of Cantos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. How Helena The Queen Of Adiabene And Her Son Izates, Embraced\r\nThe Jewish Religion; And How Helena Supplied The Poor With Corn, When\r\nThere Was A Great Famine At Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n1. About this time it was that Helena, queen of Adiabene, and her son\r\nIzates, changed their course of life, and embraced the Jewish customs,\r\nand this on the occasion following: Monobazus, the king of Adiabene, who\r\nhad also the name of Bazeus, fell in love with his sister Helena, and\r\ntook her to be his wife, and begat her with child. But as he was in bed\r\nwith her one night, he laid his hand upon his wife's belly, and fell\r\nasleep, and seemed to hear a voice, which bid him take his hand off his\r\nwife's belly, and not hurt the infant that was therein, which, by God's\r\nprovidence, would be safely born, and have a happy end. This voice put\r\nhim into disorder; so he awaked immediately, and told the story to his\r\nwife; and when his son was born, he called him Izates. He had indeed\r\nMonobazus, his elder brother, by Helena also, as he had other sons by\r\nother wives besides. Yet did he openly place all his affections on this\r\nhis only begotten 2 son Izates, which was the origin of that envy which\r\nhis other brethren, by the same father, bore to him; while on this\r\naccount they hated him more and more, and were all under great\r\naffliction that their father should prefer Izates before them. Now\r\nalthough their father was very sensible of these their passions, yet did\r\nhe forgive them, as not indulging those passions out of an ill\r\ndisposition, but out of a desire each of them had to be beloved by their\r\nfather. However, he sent Izates, with many presents, to Abennerig, the\r\nking of Charax- Spasini, and that out of the great dread he was in about\r\nhim, lest he should come to some misfortune by the hatred his brethren\r\nbore him; and he committed his son's preservation to him. Upon which\r\nAbennerig gladly received the young man, and had a great affection for\r\nhim, and married him to his own daughter, whose name was Samacha: he\r\nalso bestowed a country upon him, from which he received large revenues.\r\n\r\n2. But when Monobazus was grown old, and saw that he had but a little\r\ntime to live, he had a mind to come to the sight of his son before he\r\ndied. So he sent for him, and embraced him after the most affectionate\r\nmanner, and bestowed on him the country called Carra; it was a soil that\r\nbare amomum in great plenty: there are also in it the remains of that\r\nark, wherein it is related that Noah escaped the deluge, and where they\r\nare still shown to such as are desirous to see them. 3 Accordingly,\r\nIzates abode in that country until his father's death. But the very day\r\nthat Monobazus died, queen Helena sent for all the grandees, and\r\ngovernors of the kingdom, and for those that had the armies committed to\r\ntheir command; and when they were come, she made the following speech to\r\nthem: \"I believe you are not unacquainted that my husband was desirous\r\nIzates should succeed him in the government, and thought him worthy so\r\nto do. However, I wait your determination; for happy is he who receives\r\na kingdom, not from a single person only, but from the willing suffrages\r\nof a great many.\" This she said, in order to try those that were\r\ninvited, and to discover their sentiments. Upon the hearing of which,\r\nthey first of all paid their homage to the queen, as their custom was,\r\nand then they said that they confirmed the king's determination, and\r\nwould submit to it; and they rejoiced that Izates's father had preferred\r\nhim before the rest of his brethren, as being agreeable to all their\r\nwishes: but that they were desirous first of all to slay his brethren\r\nand kinsmen, that so the government might come securely to Izates;\r\nbecause if they were once destroyed, all that fear would be over which\r\nmight arise from their hatred and envy to him. Helena replied to this,\r\nthat she returned them her thanks for their kindness to herself and to\r\nIzates; but desired that they would however defer the execution of this\r\nslaughter of Izates's brethren till he should be there himself, and give\r\nhis approbation to it. So since these men had not prevailed with her,\r\nwhen they advised her to slay them, they exhorted her at least to keep\r\nthem in bonds till he should come, and that for their own security; they\r\nalso gave her counsel to set up some one whom she could put the greatest\r\ntrust in, as a governor of the kingdom in the mean time. So queen Helena\r\ncomplied with this counsel of theirs, and set up Monobazus, the eldest\r\nson, to be king, and put the diadem upon his head, and gave him his\r\nfather's ring, with its signet; as also the ornament which they call\r\nSampser, and exhorted him to administer the affairs of the kingdom till\r\nhis brother should come; who came suddenly upon hearing that his father\r\nwas dead, and succeeded his brother Monobazus, who resigned up the\r\ngovernment to him.\r\n\r\n3. Now, during the time Izates abode at Charax-Spasini, a certain Jewish\r\nmerchant, whose name was Ananias, got among the women that belonged to\r\nthe king, and taught them to worship God according to the Jewish\r\nreligion. He, moreover, by their means, became known to Izates, and\r\npersuaded him, in like manner, to embrace that religion; he also, at the\r\nearnest entreaty of Izates, accompanied him when he was sent for by his\r\nfather to come to Adiabene; it also happened that Helena, about the same\r\ntime, was instructed by a certain other Jew and went over to them. But\r\nwhen Izates had taken the kingdom, and was come to Adiabene, and there\r\nsaw his brethren and other kinsmen in bonds, he was displeased at it;\r\nand as he thought it an instance of impiety either to slay or imprison\r\nthem, but still thought it a hazardous thing for to let them have their\r\nliberty, with the remembrance of the injuries that had been offered\r\nthem, he sent some of them and their children for hostages to Rome, to\r\nClaudius Cæsar, and sent the others to Artabanus, the king of Parthia,\r\nwith the like intentions.\r\n\r\n4. And when he perceived that his mother was highly pleased with the\r\nJewish customs, he made haste to change, and to embrace them entirely;\r\nand as he supposed that he could not be thoroughly a Jew unless he were\r\ncircumcised, he was ready to have it done. But when his mother\r\nunderstood what he was about, she endeavored to hinder him from doing\r\nit, and said to him that this thing would bring him into danger; and\r\nthat, as he was a king, he would thereby bring himself into great odium\r\namong his subjects, when they should understand that he was so fond of\r\nrites that were to them strange and foreign; and that they would never\r\nbear to be ruled over by a Jew. This it was that she said to him, and\r\nfor the present persuaded him to forbear. And when he had related what\r\nshe had said to Ananias, he confirmed what his mother had said; and when\r\nhe had also threatened to leave him, unless he complied with him, he\r\nwent away from him, and said that he was afraid lest such an action\r\nbeing once become public to all, he should himself be in danger of\r\npunishment for having been the occasion of it, and having been the\r\nking's instructor in actions that were of ill reputation; and he said\r\nthat he might worship God without being circumcised, even though he did\r\nresolve to follow the Jewish law entirely, which worship of God was of a\r\nsuperior nature to circumcision. He added, that God would forgive him,\r\nthough he did not perform the operation, while it was omitted out of\r\nnecessity, and for fear of his subjects. So the king at that time\r\ncomplied with these persuasions of Ananias. But afterwards, as he had\r\nnot quite left off his desire of doing this thing, a certain other Jew\r\nthat came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar, and who was esteemed\r\nvery skillful in the learning of his country, persuaded him to do the\r\nthing; for as he entered into his palace to salute him, and found him\r\nreading the law of Moses, he said to him, \"Thou dost not consider, O\r\nking! that thou unjustly breakest the principal of those laws, and art\r\ninjurious to God himself, [by omitting to be circumcised]; for thou\r\noughtest not only to read them, but chiefly to practice what they enjoin\r\nthee. How long wilt thou continue uncircumcised? But if thou hast not\r\nyet read the law about circumcision, and dost not know how great impiety\r\nthou art guilty of by neglecting it, read it now.\" When the king had\r\nheard what he said, he delayed the thing no longer, but retired to\r\nanother room, and sent for a surgeon, and did what he was commanded to\r\ndo. He then sent for his mother, and Ananias his tutor, and informed\r\nthem that he had done the thing; upon which they were presently struck\r\nwith astonishment and fear, and that to a great degree, lest the thing\r\nshould be openly discovered and censured, and the king should hazard the\r\nloss of his kingdom, while his subjects would not bear to be governed by\r\na man who was so zealous in another religion; and lest they should\r\nthemselves run some hazard, because they would be supposed the occasion\r\nof his so doing. But it was God himself who hindered what they feared\r\nfrom taking effect; for he preserved both Izates himself and his sons\r\nwhen they fell into many dangers, and procured their deliverance when it\r\nseemed to be impossible, and demonstrated thereby that the fruit of\r\npiety does not perish as to those that have regard to him, and fix their\r\nfaith upon him only. 4 But these events we shall relate hereafter.\r\n\r\n5. But as to Helena, the king's mother, when she saw that the affairs of\r\nIzates's kingdom were in peace, and that her son was a happy man, and\r\nadmired among all men, and even among foreigners, by the means of God's\r\nprovidence over him, she had a mind to go to the city of Jerusalem, in\r\norder to worship at that temple of God which was so very famous among\r\nall men, and to offer her thank-offerings there. So she desired her son\r\nto give her leave to go thither; upon which he gave his consent to what\r\nshe desired very willingly, and made great preparations for her\r\ndismission, and gave her a great deal of money, and she went down to the\r\ncity Jerusalem, her son conducting her on her journey a great way. Now\r\nher coming was of very great advantage to the people of Jerusalem; for\r\nwhereas a famine did oppress them at that time, and many people died for\r\nwant of what was necessary to procure food withal, queen Helena sent\r\nsome of her servants to Alexandria with money to buy a great quantity of\r\ncorn, and others of them to Cyprus, to bring a cargo of dried figs. And\r\nas soon as they were come back, and had brought those provisions, which\r\nwas done very quickly, she distributed food to those that were in want\r\nof it, and left a most excellent memorial behind her of this\r\nbenefaction, which she bestowed on our whole nation. And when her son\r\nIzates was informed of this famine, 5 he sent great sums of money to the\r\nprincipal men in Jerusalem. However, what favors this queen and king\r\nconferred upon our city Jerusalem shall be further related hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. How Artabanus, the King of Parthia out of Fear of the Secret\r\nContrivances of His Subjects Against Him, Went to Izates, and Was By Him\r\nReinstated in His Government; as Also How Bardanes His Son Denounced War\r\nAgainst Izates.\r\n\r\n1. But now Artabanus, king of the Parthians perceiving that the\r\ngovernors of the provinces had framed a plot against him, did not think\r\nit safe for him to continue among them; but resolved to go to Izates, in\r\nhopes of finding some way for his preservation by his means, and, if\r\npossible, for his return to his own dominions. So he came to Izates, and\r\nbrought a thousand of his kindred and servants with him, and met him\r\nupon the road, while he well knew Izates, but Izates did not know him.\r\nWhen Artabanus stood near him, and, in the first place, worshipped him,\r\naccording to the custom, he then said to him, \"O king! do not thou\r\noverlook me thy servant, nor do thou proudly reject the suit I make\r\nthee; for as I am reduced to a low estate, by the change of fortune, and\r\nof a king am become a private man, I stand in need of thy assistance.\r\nHave regard, therefore, unto the uncertainty of fortune, and esteem the\r\ncare thou shalt take of me to be taken of thyself also; for if I be\r\nneglected, and my subjects go off unpunished, many other subjects will\r\nbecome the more insolent towards other kings also.\" And this speech\r\nArtabanus made with tears in his eyes, and with a dejected countenance.\r\nNow as soon as Izates heard Artabanus's name, and saw him stand as a\r\nsupplicant before him, he leaped down from his horse immediately, and\r\nsaid to him, \"Take courage, O king! nor be disturbed at thy present\r\ncalamity, as if it were incurable; for the change of thy sad condition\r\nshall be sudden; for thou shalt find me to be more thy friend and thy\r\nassistant than thy hopes can promise thee; for I will either re-\r\nestablish thee in the kingdom of Parthia, or lose my own.\"\r\n\r\n2. When he had said this, he set Artabanus upon his horse, and followed\r\nhim on foot, in honor of a king whom he owned as greater than himself;\r\nwhich, when Artabanus saw, he was very uneasy at it, and sware by his\r\npresent fortune and honor that he would get down from his horse, unless\r\nIzates would get upon his horse again, and go before him. So he complied\r\nwith his desire, and leaped upon his horse; and when he had brought him\r\nto his royal palace, he showed him all sorts of respect when they sat\r\ntogether, and he gave him the upper place at festivals also, as\r\nregarding not his present fortune, but his former dignity, and that upon\r\nthis consideration also, that the changes of fortune are common to all\r\nmen. He also wrote to the Parthians, to persuade them to receive\r\nArtabanus again; and gave them his right hand and his faith, that he\r\nshould forget what was past and done, and that he would undertake for\r\nthis as a mediator between them. Now the Parthians did not themselves\r\nrefuse to receive him again, but pleaded that it was not now in their\r\npower so to do, because they had committed the government to another\r\nperson, who had accepted of it, and whose name was Cinnamus; and that\r\nthey were afraid lest a civil war should arise on this account. When\r\nCinnamus understood their intentions, he wrote to Artabanus himself, for\r\nhe had been brought up by him, and was of a nature good and gentle also,\r\nand desired him to put confidence in him, and to come and take his own\r\ndominions again. Accordingly, Artabanus trusted him, and returned home;\r\nwhen Cinnamus met him, worshipped him, and saluted him as a king, and\r\ntook the diadem off his own head, and put it on the head of Artabanus.\r\n\r\n3. And thus was Artahanus restored to his kingdom again by the means of\r\nIzates, when he had lost it by the means of the grandees of the kingdom.\r\nNor was he unmindful of the benefits he had conferred upon him, but\r\nrewarded him with such honors as were of the greatest esteem among them;\r\nfor he gave him leave to wear his tiara upright, 6 and to sleep upon a\r\ngolden bed, which are privileges and marks of honor peculiar to the\r\nkings of Parthia. He also cut off a large and fruitful country from the\r\nking of Armenia, and bestowed it upon him. The name of the country is\r\nNisibis, wherein the Macedonians had formerly built that city which they\r\ncalled Antioch of Mygodonia. And these were the honors that were paid\r\nIzates by the king of the Parthians.\r\n\r\n4. But in no long time Artabanus died, and left his kingdom to his son\r\nBardanes. Now this Bardanes came to Izates, and would have persuaded him\r\nto join him with his army, and to assist him in the war he was preparing\r\nto make with the Romans; but he could not prevail with him. For Izates\r\nso well knew the strength and good fortune of the Romans, that he took\r\nBardanes to attempt what was impossible to be done; and having besides\r\nsent his sons, five in number, and they but young also, to learn\r\naccurately the language of our nation, together with our learning, as\r\nwell as he had sent his mother to worship at our temple, as I have said\r\nalready, was the more backward to a compliance; and restrained Bardanes,\r\ntelling him perpetually of the great armies and famous actions of the\r\nRomans, and thought thereby to terrify him, and desired thereby to\r\nhinder him from that expedition. But the Parthian king was provoked at\r\nthis his behavior, and denounced war immediately against Izates. Yet did\r\nhe gain no advantage by this war, because God cut off all his hopes\r\ntherein; for the Parthians perceiving Bardanes's intentions, and how he\r\nhad determined to make war with the Romans, slew him, and gave his\r\nkingdom to his brother Gotarzes. He also, in no long time, perished by a\r\nplot made against him, and Vologases, his brother, succeeded him, who\r\ncommitted two of his provinces to two of his brothers by the same\r\nfather; that of the Medes to the elder, Pacorus; and Armenia to the\r\nyounger, Tiridates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. How Izates Was Betrayed By His Own Subjects, And Fought\r\nAgainst By The Arabians And How Izates, By The Providence Of God, Was\r\nDelivered Out Of Their Hands.\r\n\r\n1. Now when the king's brother, Monobazus, and his other kindred, saw\r\nhow Izates, by his piety to God, was become greatly esteemed by all men,\r\nthey also had a desire to leave the religion of their country, and to\r\nembrace the customs of the Jews; but that act of theirs was discovered\r\nby Izates's subjects. Whereupon the grandees were much displeased, and\r\ncould not contain their anger at them; but had an intention, when they\r\nshould find a proper opportunity, to inflict a punishment upon them.\r\nAccordingly, they wrote to Abia, king of the Arabians, and promised him\r\ngreat sums of money, if he would make an expedition against their king;\r\nand they further promised him, that, on the first onset, they would\r\ndesert their king, because they were desirous to punish him, by reason\r\nof the hatred he had to their religious worship; then they obliged\r\nthemselves, by oaths, to be faithful to each other, and desired that he\r\nwould make haste in this design. The king of Arabia complied with their\r\ndesires, and brought a great army into the field, and marched against\r\nIzates; and, in the beginning of the first onset, and before they came\r\nto a close fight, those grandees, as if they had a panic terror upon\r\nthem, all deserted Izates, as they had agreed to do, and, turning their\r\nbacks upon their enemies, ran away. Yet was not Izates dismayed at this;\r\nbut when he understood that the grandees had betrayed him, he also\r\nretired into his camp, and made inquiry into the matter; and as soon as\r\nhe knew who they were that made this conspiracy with the king of Arabia,\r\nhe cut off those that were found guilty; and renewing the fight on the\r\nnext day, he slew the greatest part of his enemies, and forced all the\r\nrest to betake themselves to flight. He also pursued their king, and\r\ndrove him into a fortress called Arsamus, and following on the siege\r\nvigorously, he took that fortress. And when he had plundered it of all\r\nthe prey that was in it, which was not small, he returned to Adiabene;\r\nyet did not he take Abia alive, because, when he found himself\r\nencompassed on every side, he slew himself.\r\n\r\n2. But although the grandees of Adiabene had failed in their first\r\nattempt, as being delivered up by God into their king's hands, yet would\r\nthey not even then be quiet, but wrote again to Vologases, who was then\r\nking of Parthia, and desired that he would kill Izates, and set over\r\nthem some other potentate, who should be of a Parthian family; for they\r\nsaid that they hated their own king for abrogating the laws of their\r\nforefathers, and embracing foreign customs. When the king of Parthia\r\nheard this, he boldly made war upon Izates; and as he had no just\r\npretense for this war, he sent to him, and demanded back those honorable\r\nprivileges which had been bestowed on him by his father, and threatened,\r\non his refusal, to make war upon him. Upon hearing of this, Izates was\r\nunder no small trouble of mind, as thinking it would be a reproach upon\r\nhim to appear to resign those privileges that had been bestowed upon him\r\nout of cowardice; yet because he knew, that though the king of Parthia\r\nshould receive back those honors, yet would he not be quiet, he resolved\r\nto commit himself to God, his Protector, in the present danger he was in\r\nof his life; and as he esteemed him to be his principal assistant, he\r\nintrusted his children and his wives to a very strong fortress, and laid\r\nup his corn in his citadels, and set the hay and the grass on fire. And\r\nwhen he had thus put things in order, as well as he could, he awaited\r\nthe coming of the enemy. And when the king of Parthia was come, with a\r\ngreat army of footmen and horsemen, which he did sooner than was\r\nexpected, [for he marched in great haste,] and had cast up a bank at the\r\nriver that parted Adiabene from Media,—Izates also pitched his camp not\r\nfar off, having with him six thousand horsemen. But there came a\r\nmessenger to Izates, sent by the king of Parthia, who told him how large\r\nhis dominions were, as reaching from the river Euphrates to Bactria, and\r\nenumerated that king's subjects; he also threatened him that he should\r\nbe punished, as a person ungrateful to his lords; and said that the God\r\nwhom he worshipped could not deliver him out of the king's hands. When\r\nthe messenger had delivered this his message, Izates replied that he\r\nknew the king of Parthia's power was much greater than his own; but that\r\nhe knew also that God was much more powerful than all men. And when he\r\nhad returned him this answer, he betook himself to make supplication to\r\nGod, and threw himself upon the ground, and put ashes upon his head, in\r\ntestimony of his confusion, and fasted, together with his wives and\r\nchildren. 7 Then he called upon God, and said, \"O Lord and Governor, if\r\nI have not in vain committed myself to thy goodness, but have justly\r\ndetermined that thou only art the Lord and principal of all beings, come\r\nnow to my assistance, and defend me from my enemies, not only on my own\r\naccount, but on account of their insolent behavior with regard to thy\r\npower, while they have not feared to lift up their proud and arrogant\r\ntongue against thee.\" Thus did he lament and bemoan himself, with tears\r\nin his eyes; whereupon God heard his prayer. And immediately that very\r\nnight Vologases received letters, the contents of which were these, that\r\na great band of Dahe and Sacse, despising him, now he was gone so long a\r\njourney from home, had made an expedition, and laid Parthia waste; so\r\nthat he [was forced to] retire back, without doing any thing. And thus\r\nit was that Izates escaped the threatenings of the Parthians, by the\r\nprovidence of God.\r\n\r\n3. It was not long ere Izates died, when he had completed fifty-five\r\nyears of his life, and had ruled his kingdom twenty-four years. He left\r\nbehind him twenty-four sons and twenty-four daughters. However, he gave\r\norder that his brother Monobazus should succeed in the government,\r\nthereby requiting him, because, while he was himself absent after their\r\nfather's death, he had faithfully preserved the government for him. But\r\nwhen Helena, his mother, heard of her son's death, she was in great\r\nheaviness, as was but natural, upon her loss of such a most dutiful son;\r\nyet was it a comfort to her that she heard the succession came to her\r\neldest son. Accordingly, she went to him in haste; and when she was come\r\ninto Adiabene, she did not long outlive her son Izates. But Monobazus\r\nsent her bones, as well as those of Izates, his brother, to Jerusalem,\r\nand gave order that they should be buried at the pyramids 8 which their\r\nmother had erected; they were three in number, and distant no more than\r\nthree furlongs from the city Jerusalem. But for the actions of Monobazus\r\nthe king, which he did during the rest of his life, we will relate them\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. Concerning Theudas And The Sons Of Judas The Galilean; As\r\nAlso What Calamity Fell Upon The Jews On The Day Of The Passover.\r\n\r\n1. Now it came to pass, while Fadus was procurator of Judea, that a\r\ncertain magician, whose name was Theudas, 9 persuaded a great part of\r\nthe people to take their effects with them, and follow him to the river\r\nJordan; for he told them he was a prophet, and that he would, by his own\r\ncommand, divide the river, and afford them an easy passage over it; and\r\nmany were deluded by his words. However, Fadus did not permit them to\r\nmake any advantage of his wild attempt, but sent a troop of horsemen out\r\nagainst them; who, falling upon them unexpectedly, slew many of them,\r\nand took many of them alive. They also took Theudas alive, and cut off\r\nhis head, and carried it to Jerusalem. This was what befell the Jews in\r\nthe time of Cuspius Fadus's government.\r\n\r\n2. Then came Tiberius Alexander as successor to Fadus; he was the son of\r\nAlexander the alabarch of Alexandria, which Alexander was a principal\r\nperson among all his contemporaries, both for his family and wealth: he\r\nwas also more eminent for his piety than this his son Alexander, for he\r\ndid not continue in the religion of his country. Under these procurators\r\nthat great famine happened in Judea, in which queen Helena bought corn\r\nin Egypt at a great expense, and distributed it to those that were in\r\nwant, as I have related already. And besides this, the sons of Judas of\r\nGalilee were now slain; I mean of that Judas who caused the people to\r\nrevolt, when Cyrenius came to take an account of the estates of the\r\nJews, as we have showed in a foregoing book. The names of those sons\r\nwere James and Simon, whom Alexander commanded to be crucified. But now\r\nHerod, king of Chalcis, removed Joseph, the son of Camydus, from the\r\nhigh priesthood, and made Ananias, the son of Nebedeu, his successor.\r\nAnd now it was that Cumanus came as successor to Tiberius Alexander; as\r\nalso that Herod, brother of Agrippa the great king, departed this life,\r\nin the eighth year of the reign of Claudius Cæsar. He left behind him\r\nthree sons; Aristobulus, whom he had by his first wife, with\r\nBernicianus, and Hyrcanus, both whom he had by Bernice his brother's\r\ndaughter. But Claudius Cæsar bestowed his dominions on Agrippa, junior.\r\n\r\n3. Now while the Jewish affairs were under the administration of\r\nCumanus, there happened a great tumult at the city of Jerusalem, and\r\nmany of the Jews perished therein. But I shall first explain the\r\noccasion whence it was derived. When that feast which is called the\r\npassover was at hand, at which time our custom is to use unleavened\r\nbread, and a great multitude was gathered together from all parts to\r\nthat feast, Cumanus was afraid lest some attempt of innovation should\r\nthen be made by them; so he ordered that one regiment of the army should\r\ntake their arms, and stand in the temple cloisters, to repress any\r\nattempts of innovation, if perchance any such should begin; and this was\r\nno more than what the former procurators of Judea did at such festivals.\r\nBut on the fourth day of the feast, a certain soldier let down his\r\nbreeches, and exposed his privy members to the multitude, which put\r\nthose that saw him into a furious rage, and made them cry out that this\r\nimpious action was not done to approach them, but God himself; nay, some\r\nof them reproached Cumanus, and pretended that the soldier was set on by\r\nhim, which, when Cumanus heard, he was also himself not a little\r\nprovoked at such reproaches laid upon him; yet did he exhort them to\r\nleave off such seditious attempts, and not to raise a tumult at the\r\nfestival. But when he could not induce them to be quiet for they still\r\nwent on in their reproaches to him, he gave order that the whole army\r\nshould take their entire armor, and come to Antonia, which was a\r\nfortress, as we have said already, which overlooked the temple; but when\r\nthe multitude saw the soldiers there, they were affrighted at them, and\r\nran away hastily; but as the passages out were but narrow, and as they\r\nthought their enemies followed them, they were crowded together in their\r\nflight, and a great number were pressed to death in those narrow\r\npassages; nor indeed was the number fewer than twenty thousand that\r\nperished in this tumult. So instead of a festival, they had at last a\r\nmournful day of it; and they all of them forgot their prayers and\r\nsacrifices, and betook themselves to lamentation and weeping; so great\r\nan affliction did the impudent obsceneness of a single soldier bring\r\nupon them. 10\r\n\r\n4. Now before this their first mourning was over, another mischief\r\nbefell them also; for some of those that raised the foregoing tumult,\r\nwhen they were traveling along the public road, about a hundred furlongs\r\nfrom the city, robbed Stephanus, a servant of Cæsar, as he was\r\njourneying, and plundered him of all that he had with him; which things\r\nwhen Cumanus heard of, he sent soldiers immediately, and ordered them to\r\nplunder the neighboring villages, and to bring the most eminent persons\r\namong them in bonds to him. Now as this devastation was making, one of\r\nthe soldiers seized the laws of Moses that lay in one of those villages,\r\nand brought them out before the eyes of all present, and tore them to\r\npieces; and this was done with reproachful language, and much\r\nscurrility; which things when the Jews heard of, they ran together, and\r\nthat in great numbers, and came down to Cæsarea, where Cumanus then was,\r\nand besought him that he would avenge, not themselves, but God himself,\r\nwhose laws had been affronted; for that they could not bear to live any\r\nlonger, if the laws of their forefathers must be affronted after this\r\nmanner. Accordingly Cumanus, out of fear lest the multitude should go\r\ninto a sedition, and by the advice of his friends also, took care that\r\nthe soldier who had offered the affront to the laws should be beheaded,\r\nand thereby put a stop to the sedition which was ready to be kindled a\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. How There Happened A Quarrel Between The Jews And The\r\nSamaritans; And How Claudius Put An End To Their Differences.\r\n\r\n1. Now there arose a quarrel between the Samaritans and the Jews on the\r\noccasion following: It was the custom of the Galileans, when they came\r\nto the holy city at the festivals, to take their journeys through the\r\ncountry of the Samaritans; 11 and at this time there lay, in the road\r\nthey took, a village that was called Ginea, which was situated in the\r\nlimits of Samaria and the great plain, where certain persons thereto\r\nbelonging fought with the Galileans, and killed a great many of them.\r\nBut when the principal of the Galileans were informed of what had been\r\ndone, they came to Cumanus, and desired him to avenge the murder of\r\nthose that were killed; but he was induced by the Samaritans, with\r\nmoney, to do nothing in the matter; upon which the Galileans were much\r\ndispleased, and persuaded the multitude of the Jews to betake themselves\r\nto arms, and to regain their liberty, saying that slavery was in itself\r\na bitter thing, but that when it was joined with direct injuries, it was\r\nperfectly intolerable, And when their principal men endeavored to pacify\r\nthem, and promised to endeavor to persuade Cumanus to avenge those that\r\nwere killed, they would not hearken to them, but took their weapons, and\r\nentreated the assistance of Eleazar, the son of Dineus, a robber, who\r\nhad many years made his abode in the mountains, with which assistance\r\nthey plundered many villages of the Samaritans. When Cumanus heard of\r\nthis action of theirs, he took the band of Sebaste, with four regiments\r\nof footmen, and armed the Samaritans, and marched out against the Jews,\r\nand caught them, and slew many of them, and took a great number of them\r\nalive; whereupon those that were the most eminent persons at Jerusalem,\r\nand that both in regard to the respect that was paid them, and the\r\nfamilies they were of, as soon as they saw to what a height things were\r\ngone, put on sackcloth, and heaped ashes upon their heads, and by all\r\npossible means besought the seditious, and persuaded them that they\r\nwould set before their eyes the utter subversion of their country, the\r\nconflagration of their temple, and the slavery of themselves, their\r\nwives, and children, 12 which would be the consequences of what they\r\nwere doing; and would alter their minds, would cast away their weapons,\r\nand for the future be quiet, and return to their own homes. These\r\npersuasions of theirs prevailed upon them. So the people dispersed\r\nthemselves, and the robbers went away again to their places of strength;\r\nand after this time all Judea was overrun with robberies.\r\n\r\n2. But the principal of the Samaritans went to Ummidius Quadratus, the\r\npresident of Syria, who at that time was at Tyre, and accused the Jews\r\nof setting their villages on fire, and plundering them; and said withal,\r\nthat they were not so much displeased at what they had suffered, as they\r\nwere at the contempt thereby showed the Romans; while if they had\r\nreceived any injury, they ought to have made them the judges of what had\r\nbeen done, and not presently to make such devastation, as if they had\r\nnot the Romans for their governors; on which account they came to him,\r\nin order to obtain that vengeance they wanted. This was the accusation\r\nwhich the Samaritans brought against the Jews. But the Jews affirmed\r\nthat the Samaritans were the authors of this tumult and fighting, and\r\nthat, in the first place, Cumanus had been corrupted by their gifts, and\r\npassed over the murder of those that were slain in silence;—which\r\nallegations when Quadratus heard, he put off the hearing of the cause,\r\nand promised that he would give sentence when he should come into Judea,\r\nand should have a more exact knowledge of the truth of that matter. So\r\nthese men went away without success. Yet was it not long ere Quadratus\r\ncame to Samaria, where, upon hearing the cause, he supposed that the\r\nSamaritans were the authors of that disturbance. But when he was\r\ninformed that certain of the Jews were making innovations, he ordered\r\nthose to be crucified whom Cumanus had taken captives. From whence he\r\ncame to a certain village called Lydda, which was not less than a city\r\nin largeness, and there heard the Samaritan cause a second time before\r\nhis tribunal, and there learned from a certain Samaritan that one of the\r\nchief of the Jews, whose name was Dortus, and some other innovators with\r\nhim, four in number, persuaded the multitude to a revolt from the\r\nRomans; whom Quadratus ordered to be put to death: but still he sent\r\naway Ananias the high priest, and Ananus the commander [of the temple],\r\nin bonds to Rome, to give an account of what they had done to Claudius\r\nCæsar. He also ordered the principal men, both of the Samaritans and of\r\nthe Jews, as also Cumanus the procurator, and Celer the tribune, to go\r\nto Italy to the emperor, that he might hear their cause, and determine\r\ntheir differences one with another. But he came again to the city of\r\nJerusalem, out of his fear that the multitude of the Jews should attempt\r\nsome innovations; but he found the city in a peaceable state, and\r\ncelebrating one of the usual festivals of their country to God. So he\r\nbelieved that they would not attempt any innovations, and left them at\r\nthe celebration of the festival, and returned to Antioch.\r\n\r\n3. Now Cumanus, and the principal of the Samaritans, who were sent to\r\nRome, had a day appointed them by the emperor whereon they were to have\r\npleaded their cause about the quarrels they had one with another. But\r\nnow Cæsar's freed-men and his friends were very zealous on the behalf of\r\nCumanus and the Samaritans; and they had prevailed over the Jews, unless\r\nAgrippa, junior, who was then at Rome, had seen the principal of the\r\nJews hard set, and had earnestly entreated Agrippina, the emperor's\r\nwife, to persuade her husband to hear the cause, so as was agreeable to\r\nhis justice, and to condemn those to be punished who were really the\r\nauthors of this revolt from the Roman government:—whereupon Claudius was\r\nso well disposed beforehand, that when he had heard the cause, and found\r\nthat the Samaritans had been the ringleaders in those mischievous\r\ndoings, he gave order that those who came up to him should be slain, and\r\nthat Cumanus should be banished. He also gave order that Celer the\r\ntribune should be carried back to Jerusalem, and should be drawn through\r\nthe city in the sight of all the people, and then should be slain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. Felix Is Made Procurator Of Judea; As Also Concerning\r\nAgrippa, Junior And His Sisters.\r\n\r\n1. So Claudius sent Felix, the brother of Pallas, to take care of the\r\naffairs of Judea; and when he had already completed the twelfth year of\r\nhis reign, he bestowed upon Agrippa the tetrarchy of Philip and Batanea,\r\nand added thereto Trachonites, with Abila; which last had been the\r\ntetrarchy of Lysanias; but he took from him Chalcis, when he had been\r\ngovernor thereof four years. And when Agrippa had received these\r\ncountries as the gift of Cæsar, he gave his sister Drusilla in marriage\r\nto Azizus, king of Emesa, upon his consent to be circumcised; for\r\nEpiphanes, the son of king Antiochus, had refused to marry her, because,\r\nafter he had promised her father formerly to come over to the Jewish\r\nreligion, he would not now perform that promise. He also gave Mariamne\r\nin marriage to Archelaus, the son of Helcias, to whom she had formerly\r\nbeen betrothed by Agrippa her father; from which marriage was derived a\r\ndaughter, whose name was Bernice.\r\n\r\n2. But for the marriage of Drusilla with Azizus, it was in no long time\r\nafterward dissolved upon the following occasion: While Felix was\r\nprocurator of Judea, he saw this Drusilla, and fell in love with her;\r\nfor she did indeed exceed all other women in beauty; and he sent to her\r\na person whose name was Simon 13 one of his friends; a Jew he was, and\r\nby birth a Cypriot, and one who pretended to be a magician, and\r\nendeavored to persuade her to forsake her present husband, and marry\r\nhim; and promised, that if she would not refuse him, he would make her a\r\nhappy woman. Accordingly she acted ill, and because she was desirous to\r\navoid her sister Bernice's envy, for she was very ill treated by her on\r\naccount of her beauty, was prevailed upon to transgress the laws of her\r\nforefathers, and to marry Felix; and when he had had a son by her, he\r\nnamed him Agrippa. But after what manner that young man, with his wife,\r\nperished at the conflagration of the mountain Vesuvius, 14 in the days\r\nof Titus Cæsar, shall be related hereafter. 15\r\n\r\n3. But as for Bernice, she lived a widow a long while after the death of\r\nHerod [king of Chalcis], who was both her husband and her uncle; but\r\nwhen the report went that she had criminal conversation with her\r\nbrother, [Agrippa, junior,] she persuaded Poleme, who was king of\r\nCilicia, to be circumcised, and to marry her, as supposing that by this\r\nmeans she should prove those calumnies upon her to be false; and Poleme\r\nwas prevailed upon, and that chiefly on account of her riches. Yet did\r\nnot this matrimony endure long; but Bernice left Poleme, and, as was\r\nsaid, with impure intentions. So he forsook at once this matrimony, and\r\nthe Jewish religion; and, at the same time, Mariamne put away Archelaus,\r\nand was married to Demetrius, the principal man among the Alexandrian\r\nJews, both for his family and his wealth; and indeed he was then their\r\nalabarch. So she named her son whom she had by him Agrippinus. But of\r\nall these particulars we shall hereafter treat more exactly. 16\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. After What Manner Upon The Death Of Claudius, Nero Succeeded\r\nIn The Government; As Also What Barbarous Things He Did. Concerning The\r\nRobbers, Murderers And Impostors, That Arose While Felix And Festus Were\r\nProcurators Of Judea.\r\n\r\n1. Now Claudius Cæsar died when he had reigned thirteen years, eight\r\nmonths, and twenty days; 17 and a report went about that he was poisoned\r\nby his wife Agrippina. Her father was Germanicus, the brother of Cæsar.\r\nHer husband was Domitius Aenobarbus, one of the most illustrious persons\r\nthat was in the city of Rome; after whose death, and her long\r\ncontinuance in widowhood, Claudius took her to wife. She brought along\r\nwith her a son, Domtitus, of the same name with his father. He had\r\nbefore this slain his wife Messalina, out of jealousy, by whom he had\r\nhis children Britannicus and Octavia; their eldest sister was Antonia,\r\nwhom he had by Pelina his first wife. He also married Octavia to Nero;\r\nfor that was the name that Cæsar gave him afterward, upon his adopting\r\nhim for his son.\r\n\r\n2. But now Agrippina was afraid, lest, when Britannicus should come to\r\nman's estate, he should succeed his father in the government, and\r\ndesired to seize upon the principality beforehand for her own son\r\n[Nero]; upon which the report went that she thence compassed the death\r\nof Claudius. Accordingly, she sent Burrhus, the general of the army,\r\nimmediately, and with him the tribunes, and such also of the freed-men\r\nas were of the greatest authority, to bring Nero away into the camp, and\r\nto salute him emperor. And when Nero had thus obtained the government,\r\nhe got Britannicus to be so poisoned, that the multitude should not\r\nperceive it; although he publicly put his own mother to death not long\r\nafterward, making her this requital, not only for being born of her, but\r\nfor bringing it so about by her contrivances that he obtained the Roman\r\nempire. He also slew Octavia his own wife, and many other illustrious\r\npersons, under this pretense, that they plotted against him.\r\n\r\n3. But I omit any further discourse about these affairs; for there have\r\nbeen a great many who have composed the history of Nero; some of which\r\nhave departed from the truth of facts out of favor, as having received\r\nbenefits from him; while others, out of hatred to him, and the great\r\nill-will which they bare him, have so impudently raved against him with\r\ntheir lies, that they justly deserve to be condemned. Nor do I wonder at\r\nsuch as have told lies of Nero, since they have not in their writings\r\npreserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than\r\nhis time, even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred,\r\nsince those writers lived a long time after them. But as to those that\r\nhave no regard to truth, they may write as they please; for in that they\r\ntake delight: but as to ourselves, who have made truth our direct aim,\r\nwe shall briefly touch upon what only belongs remotely to this\r\nundertaking, but shall relate what hath happened to us Jews with great\r\naccuracy, and shall not grudge our pains in giving an account both of\r\nthe calamities we have suffered, and of the crimes we have been guilty\r\nof. I will now therefore return to the relation of our own affairs.\r\n\r\n4. For in the first year of the reign of Nero, upon the death of Azizus,\r\nking of Emesa, Soemus, his brother, succeeded in his kingdom, and\r\nAristobulus, the son of Herod, king of Chalcis, was intrusted by Nero\r\nwith the government of the Lesser Armenia. Cæsar also bestowed on\r\nAgrippa a certain part of Galilee, Tiberias, and Tarichae, 18 and\r\nordered them to submit to his jurisdiction. He gave him also Julias, a\r\ncity of Perea, with fourteen villages that lay about it.\r\n\r\n5. Now as for the affairs of the Jews, they grew worse and worse\r\ncontinually, for the country was again filled with robbers and\r\nimpostors, who deluded the multitude. Yet did Felix catch and put to\r\ndeath many of those impostors every day, together with the robbers. He\r\nalso caught Eleazar, the son of Dineas, who had gotten together a\r\ncompany of robbers; and this he did by treachery; for he gave him\r\nassurance that he should suffer no harm, and thereby persuaded him to\r\ncome to him; but when he came, he bound him, and sent him to Rome. Felix\r\nalso bore an ill-will to Jonathan, the high priest, because he\r\nfrequently gave him admonitions about governing the Jewish affairs\r\nbetter than he did, lest he should himself have complaints made of him\r\nby the multitude, since he it was who had desired Cæsar to send him as\r\nprocurator of Judea. So Felix contrived a method whereby he might get\r\nrid of him, now he was become so continually troublesome to him; for\r\nsuch continual admonitions are grievous to those who are disposed to act\r\nunjustly. Wherefore Felix persuaded one of Jonathan's most faithful\r\nfriends, a citizen of Jerusalem, whose name was Doras, to bring the\r\nrobbers upon Jonathan, in order to kill him; and this he did by\r\npromising to give him a great deal of money for so doing. Doras complied\r\nwith the proposal, and contrived matters so, that the robbers might\r\nmurder him after the following manner: Certain of those robbers went up\r\nto the city, as if they were going to worship God, while they had\r\ndaggers under their garments, and by thus mingling themselves among the\r\nmultitude they slew Jonathan 19 and as this murder was never avenged,\r\nthe robbers went up with the greatest security at the festivals after\r\nthis time; and having weapons concealed in like manner as before, and\r\nmingling themselves among the multitude, they slew certain of their own\r\nenemies, and were subservient to other men for money; and slew others,\r\nnot only in remote parts of the city, but in the temple itself also; for\r\nthey had the boldness to murder men there, without thinking of the\r\nimpiety of which they were guilty. And this seems to me to have been the\r\nreason why God, out of his hatred of these men's wickedness, rejected\r\nour city; and as for the temple, he no longer esteemed it sufficiently\r\npure for him to inhabit therein, but brought the Romans upon us, and\r\nthrew a fire upon the city to purge it; and brought upon us, our wives,\r\nand children, slavery, as desirous to make us wiser by our calamities.\r\n\r\n6. These works, that were done by the robbers, filled the city with all\r\nsorts of impiety. And now these impostors and deceivers persuaded the\r\nmultitude to follow them into the wilderness, and pretended that they\r\nwould exhibit manifest wonders and signs, that should be performed by\r\nthe providence of God. And many that were prevailed on by them suffered\r\nthe punishments of their folly; for Felix brought them back, and then\r\npunished them. Moreover, there came out of Egypt 20 about this time to\r\nJerusalem one that said he was a prophet, and advised the multitude of\r\nthe common people to go along with him to the Mount of Olives, as it was\r\ncalled, which lay over against the city, and at the distance of five\r\nfurlongs. He said further, that he would show them from hence how, at\r\nhis command, the walls of Jerusalem would fall down; and he promised\r\nthem that he would procure them an entrance into the city through those\r\nwalls, when they were fallen down. Now when Felix was informed of these\r\nthings, he ordered his soldiers to take their weapons, and came against\r\nthem with a great number of horsemen and footmen from Jerusalem, and\r\nattacked the Egyptian and the people that were with him. He also slew\r\nfour hundred of them, and took two hundred alive. But the Egyptian\r\nhimself escaped out of the fight, but did not appear any more. And again\r\nthe robbers stirred up the people to make war with the Romans, and said\r\nthey ought not to obey them at all; and when any persons would not\r\ncomply with them, they set fire to their villages, and plundered them.\r\n\r\n7. And now it was that a great sedition arose between the Jews that\r\ninhabited Cæsarea, and the Syrians who dwelt there also, concerning\r\ntheir equal right to the privileges belonging to citizens; for the Jews\r\nclaimed the pre-eminence, because Herod their king was the builder of\r\nCæsarea, and because he was by birth a Jew. Now the Syrians did not deny\r\nwhat was alleged about Herod; but they said that Cæsarea was formerly\r\ncalled Strato's Tower, and that then there was not one Jewish\r\ninhabitant. When the presidents of that country heard of these\r\ndisorders, they caught the authors of them on both sides, and tormented\r\nthem with stripes, and by that means put a stop to the disturbance for a\r\ntime. But the Jewish citizens depending on their wealth, and on that\r\naccount despising the Syrians, reproached them again, and hoped to\r\nprovoke them by such reproaches. However, the Syrians, though they were\r\ninferior in wealth, yet valuing themselves highly on this account, that\r\nthe greatest part of the Roman soldiers that were there were either of\r\nCæsarea or Sebaste, they also for some time used reproachful language to\r\nthe Jews also; and thus it was, till at length they came to throwing\r\nstones at one another, and several were wounded, and fell on both sides,\r\nthough still the Jews were the conquerors. But when Felix saw that this\r\nquarrel was become a kind of war, he came upon them on the sudden, and\r\ndesired the Jews to desist; and when they refused so to do, he armed his\r\nsoldiers, and sent them out upon them, and slew many of them, and took\r\nmore of them alive, and permitted his soldiers to plunder some of the\r\nhouses of the citizens, which were full of riches. Now those Jews that\r\nwere more moderate, and of principal dignity among them, were afraid of\r\nthemselves, and desired of Felix that he would sound a retreat to his\r\nsoldiers, and spare them for the future, and afford them room for\r\nrepentance for what they had done; and Felix was prevailed upon to do\r\nso.\r\n\r\n8. About this time king Agrippa gave the high priesthood to Ismael, who\r\nwas the son of Fabi. And now arose a sedition between the high priests\r\nand the principal men of the multitude of Jerusalem; each of which got\r\nthem a company of the boldest sort of men, and of those that loved\r\ninnovations about them, and became leaders to them; and when they\r\nstruggled together, they did it by casting reproachful words against one\r\nanother, and by throwing stones also. And there was nobody to reprove\r\nthem; but these disorders were done after a licentious manner in the\r\ncity, as if it had no government over it. And such was the impudence 21\r\nand boldness that had seized on the high priests, that they had the\r\nhardiness to send their servants into the threshing-floors, to take away\r\nthose tithes that were due to the priests, insomuch that it so fell out\r\nthat the poorest sort of the priests died for want. To this degree did\r\nthe violence of the seditious prevail over all right and justice.\r\n\r\n9. Now when Porcius Festus was sent as successor to Felix by Nero, the\r\nprincipal of the Jewish inhabitants of Cæsarea went up to Rome to accuse\r\nFelix; and he had certainly been brought to punishment, unless Nero had\r\nyielded to the importunate solicitations of his brother Pallas, who was\r\nat that time had in the greatest honor by him. Two of the principal\r\nSyrians in Cæsarea persuaded Burrhus, who was Nero's tutor, and\r\nsecretary for his Greek epistles, by giving him a great sum of money, to\r\ndisannul that equality of the Jewish privileges of citizens which they\r\nhitherto enjoyed. So Burrhus, by his solicitations, obtained leave of\r\nthe emperor that an epistle should be written to that purpose. This\r\nepistle became the occasion of the following miseries that befell our\r\nnation; for when the Jews of Cæsarea were informed of the contents of\r\nthis epistle to the Syrians, they were more disorderly than before, till\r\na war was kindled.\r\n\r\n10. Upon Festus's coming into Judea, it happened that Judea was\r\nafflicted by the robbers, while all the villages were set on fire, and\r\nplundered by them. And then it was that the sicarii, as they were\r\ncalled, who were robbers, grew numerous. They made use of small swords,\r\nnot much different in length from the Persian acinacae, but somewhat\r\ncrooked, and like the Roman sicae, [or sickles,] as they were called;\r\nand from these weapons these robbers got their denomination; and with\r\nthese weapons they slew a great many; for they mingled themselves among\r\nthe multitude at their festivals, when they were come up in crowds from\r\nall parts to the city to worship God, as we said before, and easily slew\r\nthose that they had a mind to slay. They also came frequently upon the\r\nvillages belonging to their enemies, with their weapons, and plundered\r\nthem, and set them on fire. So Festus sent forces, both horsemen and\r\nfootmen, to fall upon those that had been seduced by a certain impostor,\r\nwho promised them deliverance and freedom from the miseries they were\r\nunder, if they would but follow him as far as the wilderness.\r\nAccordingly, those forces that were sent destroyed both him that had\r\ndeluded them, and those that were his followers also.\r\n\r\n11. About the same time king Agrippa built himself a very large dining-\r\nroom in the royal palace at Jerusalem, near to the portico. Now this\r\npalace had been erected of old by the children of Asamoneus and was\r\nsituate upon an elevation, and afforded a most delightful prospect to\r\nthose that had a mind to take a view of the city, which prospect was\r\ndesired by the king; and there he could lie down, and eat, and thence\r\nobserve what was done in the temple; which thing, when the chief men of\r\nJerusalem saw they were very much displeased at it; for it was not\r\nagreeable to the institutions of our country or law that what was done\r\nin the temple should be viewed by others, especially what belonged to\r\nthe sacrifices. They therefore erected a wall upon the uppermost\r\nbuilding which belonged to the inner court of the temple towards the\r\nwest, which wall when it was built, did not only intercept the prospect\r\nof the dining-room in the palace, but also of the western cloisters that\r\nbelonged to the outer court of the temple also, where it was that the\r\nRomans kept guards for the temple at the festivals. At these doings both\r\nking Agrippa, and principally Festus the procurator, were much\r\ndispleased; and Festus ordered them to pull the wall down again: but the\r\nJews petitioned him to give them leave to send an embassage about this\r\nmatter to Nero; for they said they could not endure to live if any part\r\nof the temple should be demolished; and when Festus had given them leave\r\nso to do, they sent ten of their principal men to Nero, as also Ismael\r\nthe high priest, and Helcias, the keeper of the sacred treasure. And\r\nwhen Nero had heard what they had to say, he not only forgave 22 them\r\nwhat they had already done, but also gave them leave to let the wall\r\nthey had built stand. This was granted them in order to gratify Poppea,\r\nNero's wife, who was a religious woman, and had requested these favors\r\nof Nero, and who gave order to the ten ambassadors to go their way home;\r\nbut retained Helcias and Ismael as hostages with herself. As soon as the\r\nking heard this news, he gave the high priesthood to Joseph, who was\r\ncalled Cabi, the son of Simon, formerly high priest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. Concerning Albinus Under Whose Procuratorship James Was\r\nSlain; As Also What Edifices Were Built By Agrippa.\r\n\r\n1. And now Cæsar, upon hearing the death of Festus, sent Albinus into\r\nJudea, as procurator. But the king deprived Joseph of the high\r\npriesthood, and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of\r\nAnanus, who was also himself called Ananus. Now the report goes that\r\nthis eldest Ananus proved a most fortunate man; for he had five sons who\r\nhad all performed the office of a high priest to God, and who had\r\nhimself enjoyed that dignity a long time formerly, which had never\r\nhappened to any other of our high priests. But this younger Ananus, who,\r\nas we have told you already, took the high priesthood, was a bold man in\r\nhis temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees,\r\n23 who are very rigid in judging offenders, above all the rest of the\r\nJews, as we have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this\r\ndisposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity [to exercise his\r\nauthority]. Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so\r\nhe assembled the sanhedrim of judges, and brought before them the\r\nbrother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some\r\nothers, [or, some of his companions]; and when he had formed an\r\naccusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be\r\nstoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens,\r\nand such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they\r\ndisliked what was done; they also sent to the king [Agrippa], desiring\r\nhim to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he\r\nhad already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to\r\nmeet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed\r\nhim that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrim without\r\nhis consent. 24 Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and\r\nwrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to\r\npunishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high\r\npriesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus,\r\nthe son of Damneus, high priest.\r\n\r\n2. Now as soon as Albinus was come to the city of Jerusalem, he used all\r\nhis endeavors and care that the country might be kept in peace, and this\r\nby destroying many of the Sicarii. But as for the high priest, Ananias\r\n25 he increased in glory every day, and this to a great degree, and had\r\nobtained the favor and esteem of the citizens in a signal manner; for he\r\nwas a great hoarder up of money: he therefore cultivated the friendship\r\nof Albinus, and of the high priest [Jesus], by making them presents; he\r\nalso had servants who were very wicked, who joined themselves to the\r\nboldest sort of the people, and went to the thrashing-floors, and took\r\naway the tithes that belonged to the priests by violence, and did not\r\nrefrain from beating such as would not give these tithes to them. So the\r\nother high priests acted in the like manner, as did those his servants,\r\nwithout any one being able to prohibit them; so that [some of the]\r\npriests, that of old were wont to be supported with those tithes, died\r\nfor want of food.\r\n\r\n3. But now the Sicarii went into the city by night, just before the\r\nfestival, which was now at hand, and took the scribe belonging to the\r\ngovernor of the temple, whose name was Eleazar, who was the son of\r\nAnanus [Ananias] the high priest, and bound him, and carried him away\r\nwith them; after which they sent to Ananias, and said that they would\r\nsend the scribe to him, if he would persuade Albinus to release ten of\r\nthose prisoners which he had caught of their party; so Ananias was\r\nplainly forced to persuade Albinus, and gained his request of him. This\r\nwas the beginning of greater calamities; for the robbers perpetually\r\ncontrived to catch some of Ananias's servants; and when they had taken\r\nthem alive, they would not let them go, till they thereby recovered some\r\nof their own Sicarii. And as they were again become no small number,\r\nthey grew bold, and were a great affliction to the whole country.\r\n\r\n4. About this time it was that king Agrippa built Cæsarea Philippi\r\nlarger than it was before, and, in honor of Nero, named it Neronlas. And\r\nwhen he had built a theater at Berytus, with vast expenses, he bestowed\r\non them shows, to be exhibited every year, and spent therein many ten\r\nthousand [drachmae]; he also gave the people a largess of corn, and\r\ndistributed oil among them, and adorned the entire city with statues of\r\nhis own donation, and with original images made by ancient hands; nay,\r\nhe almost transferred all that was most ornamental in his own kingdom\r\nthither. This made him more than ordinarily hated by his subjects,\r\nbecause he took those things away that belonged to them to adorn a\r\nforeign city. And now Jesus, the son of Gamaliel, became the successor\r\nof Jesus, the son of Damneus, in the high priesthood, which the king had\r\ntaken from the other; on which account a sedition arose between the high\r\npriests, with regard to one another; for they got together bodies of the\r\nboldest sort of the people, and frequently came, from reproaches, to\r\nthrowing of stones at each other. But Ananias was too hard for the rest,\r\nby his riches, which enabled him to gain those that were most ready to\r\nreceive. Costobarus also, and Saulus, did themselves get together a\r\nmultitude of wicked wretches, and this because they were of the royal\r\nfamily; and so they obtained favor among them, because of their kindred\r\nto Agrippa; but still they used violence with the people, and were very\r\nready to plunder those that were weaker than themselves. And from that\r\ntime it principally came to pass that our city was greatly disordered,\r\nand that all things grew worse and worse among us.\r\n\r\n5. But when Albinus heard that Gessius Florus was coming to succeed him,\r\nhe was desirous to appear to do somewhat that might be grateful to the\r\npeople of Jerusalem; so he brought out all those prisoners who seemed to\r\nhim to be most plainly worthy of death, and ordered them to be put to\r\ndeath accordingly. But as to those who had been put into prison on some\r\ntrifling occasions, he took money of them, and dismissed them; by which\r\nmeans the prisons were indeed emptied, but the country was filled with\r\nrobbers.\r\n\r\n6. Now as many of the Levites, 26 which is a tribe of ours, as were\r\nsingers of hymns, persuaded the king to assemble a sanhedrim, and to\r\ngive them leave to wear linen garments, as well as the priests for they\r\nsaid that this would be a work worthy the times of his government, that\r\nhe might have a memorial of such a novelty, as being his doing. Nor did\r\nthey fail of obtaining their desire; for the king, with the suffrages of\r\nthose that came into the sanhedrim, granted the singers of hymns this\r\nprivilege, that they might lay aside their former garments, and wear\r\nsuch a linen one as they desired; and as a part of this tribe ministered\r\nin the temple, he also permitted them to learn those hymns as they had\r\nbesought him for. Now all this was contrary to the laws of our country,\r\nwhich, whenever they have been transgressed, we have never been able to\r\navoid the punishment of such transgressions.\r\n\r\n7. And now it was that the temple was finished. So when the people saw\r\nthat the workmen were unemployed, who were above eighteen thousand and\r\nthat they, receiving no wages, were in want because they had earned\r\ntheir bread by their labors about the temple; and while they were\r\nunwilling to keep by them the treasures that were there deposited, out\r\nof fear of [their being carried away by] the Romans; and while they had\r\na regard to the making provision for the workmen; they had a mind to\r\nexpend these treasures upon them; for if any one of them did but labor\r\nfor a single hour, he received his pay immediately; so they persuaded\r\nhim to rebuild the eastern cloisters. These cloisters belonged to the\r\nouter court, and were situated in a deep valley, and had walls that\r\nreached four hundred cubits [in length], and were built of square and\r\nvery white stones, the length of each of which stones was twenty cubits,\r\nand their height six cubits. This was the work of king Solomon, 27 who\r\nfirst of all built the entire temple. But king Agrippa, who had the care\r\nof the temple committed to him by Claudius Cæsar, considering that it is\r\neasy to demolish any building, but hard to build it up again, and that\r\nit was particularly hard to do it to these cloisters, which would\r\nrequire a considerable time, and great sums of money, he denied the\r\npetitioners their request about that matter; but he did not obstruct\r\nthem when they desired the city might be paved with white stone. He also\r\ndeprived Jesus, the son of Gamaliel, of the high priesthood, and gave it\r\nto Matthias, the son of Theophilus, under whom the Jews' war with the\r\nRomans took its beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. An Enumeration Of The High Priests.\r\n\r\n1. And now I think it proper and agreeable to this history to give an\r\naccount of our high priests; how they began, who those are which are\r\ncapable of that dignity, and how many of them there had been at the end\r\nof the war. In the first place, therefore, history informs us that\r\nAaron, the brother of Moses, officiated to God as a high priest, and\r\nthat, after his death, his sons succeeded him immediately; and that this\r\ndignity hath been continued down from them all to their posterity.\r\nWhence it is a custom of our country, that no one should take the high\r\npriesthood of God but he who is of the blood of Aaron, while every one\r\nthat is of another stock, though he were a king, can never obtain that\r\nhigh priesthood. Accordingly, the number of all the high priests from\r\nAaron, of whom we have spoken already, as of the first of them, until\r\nPhanas, who was made high priest during the war by the seditious, was\r\neighty-three; of whom thirteen officiated as high priests in the\r\nwilderness, from the days of Moses, while the tabernacle was standing,\r\nuntil the people came into Judea, when king Solomon erected the temple\r\nto God; for at the first they held the high priesthood till the end of\r\ntheir life, although afterward they had successors while they were\r\nalive. Now these thirteen, who were the descendants of two of the sons\r\nof Aaron, received this dignity by succession, one after another; for\r\ntheir form of government was an aristocracy, and after that a monarchy,\r\nand in the third place the government was regal. Now the number of years\r\nduring the rule of these thirteen, from the day when our fathers\r\ndeparted out of Egypt, under Moses their leader, until the building of\r\nthat temple which king Solomon erected at Jerusalem, were six hundred\r\nand twelve. After those thirteen high priests, eighteen took the high\r\npriesthood at Jerusalem, one in succession to another, from the days of\r\nking Solomon, until Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, made an expedition\r\nagainst that city, and burnt the temple, and removed our nation into\r\nBabylon, and then took Josadek, the high priest, captive; the times of\r\nthese high priests were four hundred and sixty-six years, six months,\r\nand ten days, while the Jews were still under the regal government. But\r\nafter the term of seventy years' captivity under the Babylonians, Cyrus,\r\nking of Persia, sent the Jews from Babylon to their own land again, and\r\ngave them leave to rebuild their temple; at which time Jesus, the son of\r\nJosadek, took the high priesthood over the captives when they were\r\nreturned home. Now he and his posterity, who were in all fifteen, until\r\nking Antiochus Eupator, were under a democratical government for four\r\nhundred and fourteen years; and then the forementioned Antiochus, and\r\nLysias the general of his army, deprived Onias, who was also called\r\nMenelaus, of the high priesthood, and slew him at Berea; and driving\r\naway the son [of Onias the third], put Jaeimus into the place of the\r\nhigh priest, one that was indeed of the stock of Aaron, but not of that\r\nfamily of Onias. On which account Onias, who was the nephew of Onias\r\nthat was dead, and bore the same name with his father, came into Egypt,\r\nand got into the friendship of Ptolemy Philometor, and Cleopatra his\r\nwife, and persuaded them to make him the high priest of that temple\r\nwhich he built to God in the prefecture of Heliopolis, and this in\r\nimitation of that at Jerusalem; but as for that temple which was built\r\nin Egypt, we have spoken of it frequently already. Now when Jacimus had\r\nretained the priesthood three years, he died, and there was no one that\r\nsucceeded him, but the city continued seven years without a high priest.\r\nBut then the posterity of the sons of Asamoneus, who had the government\r\nof the nation conferred upon them, when they had beaten the Macedonians\r\nin war, appointed Jonathan to be their high priest, who ruled over them\r\nseven years. And when he had been slain by the treacherous contrivance\r\nof Trypho, as we have related some where, Simon his brother took the\r\nhigh priesthood; and when he was destroyed at a feast by the treachery\r\nof his son-in-law, his own son, whose name was Hyrcanus, succeeded him,\r\nafter he had held the high priesthood one year longer than his brother.\r\nThis Hyrcanus enjoyed that dignity thirty years, and died an old man,\r\nleaving the succession to Judas, who was also called Aristobulus, whose\r\nbrother Alexander was his heir; which Judas died of a sore distemper,\r\nafter he had kept the priesthood, together with the royal authority; for\r\nthis Judas was the first that put on his head a diadem for one year. And\r\nwhen Alexander had been both king and high priest twenty-seven years, he\r\ndeparted this life, and permitted his wife Alexandra to appoint him that\r\nshould be high priest; so she gave the high priesthood to Hyrcanus, but\r\nretained the kingdom herself nine years, and then departed this life.\r\nThe like duration [and no longer] did her son Hyrcanus enjoy the high\r\npriesthood; for after her death his brother Aristobulus fought against\r\nhim, and beat him, and deprived him of his principality; and he did\r\nhimself both reign, and perform the office of high priest to God. But\r\nwhen he had reigned three years, and as many months, Pompey came upon\r\nhim, and not only took the city of Jerusalem by force, but put him and\r\nhis children in bonds, and sent them to Rome. He also restored the high\r\npriesthood to Hyrcanus, and made him governor of the nation, but forbade\r\nhim to wear a diadem. This Hyrcanus ruled, besides his first nine years,\r\ntwenty-four years more, when Barzapharnes and Pacorus, the generals of\r\nthe Parthians, passed over Euphrates, and fought with Hyrcanus, and took\r\nhim alive, and made Antigonus, the son of Aristobulus, king; and when he\r\nhad reigned three years and three months, Sosius and Herod besieged him,\r\nand took him, when Antony had him brought to Antioch, and slain there.\r\nHerod was then made king by the Romans, but did no longer appoint high\r\npriests out of the family of Asamoneus; but made certain men to be so\r\nthat were of no eminent families, but barely of those that were priests,\r\nexcepting that he gave that dignity to Aristobulus; for when he had made\r\nthis Aristobulus, the grandson of that Hyrcanus who was then taken by\r\nthe Parthians, and had taken his sister Mariarmne to wife, he thereby\r\naimed to win the good-will of the people, who had a kind remembrance of\r\nHyrcanus [his grandfather]. Yet did he afterward, out of his fear lest\r\nthey should all bend their inclinations to Aristobulus, put him to\r\ndeath, and that by contriving how to have him suffocated as he was\r\nswimming at Jericho, as we have already related that matter; but after\r\nthis man he never intrusted the priesthood to the posterity of the sons\r\nof Asamoneus. Archelaus also, Herod's son, did like his father in the\r\nappointment of the high priests, as did the Romans also, who took the\r\ngovernment over the Jews into their hands afterward. Accordingly, the\r\nnumber of the high priests, from the days of Herod until the day when\r\nTitus took the temple and the City, and burnt them, were in all twenty-\r\neight; the time also that belonged to them was a hundred and seven\r\nyears. Some of these were the political governors of the people under\r\nthe reign of Herod, and under the reign of Archelaus his son, although,\r\nafter their death, the government became an aristocracy, and the high\r\npriests were intrusted with a dominion over the nation. And thus much\r\nmay suffice to be said concerning our high priests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. Concerning Florus The Procurator, Who Necessitated The Jews\r\nTo Take Up Arms Against The Romans. The Conclusion.\r\n\r\n1. Now Gessius Florus, who was sent as successor to Albinus by Nero,\r\nfilled Judea with abundance of miseries. He was by birth of the city of\r\nClazomene, and brought along with him his wife Cleopatra, [by whose\r\nfriendship with Poppea, Nero's wife, he obtained this government,] who\r\nwas no way different from him in wickedness. This Florus was so wicked,\r\nand so violent in the use of his authority, that the Jews took Albinus\r\nto have been [comparatively] their benefactor; so excessive were the\r\nmischiefs that he brought upon them. For Albinus concealed his\r\nwickedness, and was careful that it might not be discovered to all men;\r\nbut Gessius Florus, as though he had been sent on purpose to show his\r\ncrimes to every body, made a pompous ostentation of them to our nation,\r\nas never omitting any sort of violence, nor any unjust sort of\r\npunishment; for he was not to be moved by pity, and never was satisfied\r\nwith any degree of gain that came in his way; nor had he any more regard\r\nto great than to small acquisitions, but became a partner with the\r\nrobbers themselves. For a great many fell then into that practice\r\nwithout fear, as having him for their security, and depending on him,\r\nthat he would save them harmless in their particular robberies; so that\r\nthere were no bounds set to the nation's miseries; but the unhappy Jews,\r\nwhen they were not able to bear the devastations which the robbers made\r\namong them, were all under a necessity of leaving their own habitations,\r\nand of flying away, as hoping to dwell more easily any where else in the\r\nworld among foreigners [than in their own country]. And what need I say\r\nany more upon this head? since it was this Florus who necessitated us to\r\ntake up arms against the Romans, while we thought it better to be\r\ndestroyed at once, than by little and little. Now this war began in the\r\nsecond year of the government of Florus, and the twelfth year of the\r\nreign of Nero. But then what actions we were forced to do, or what\r\nmiseries we were enabled to suffer, may be accurately known by such as\r\nwill peruse those books which I have written about the Jewish war.\r\n\r\n2. I shall now, therefore, make an end here of my Antiquities; after the\r\nconclusion of which events, I began to write that account of the war;\r\nand these Antiquities contain what hath been delivered down to us from\r\nthe original creation of man, until the twelfth year of the reign of\r\nNero, as to what hath befallen the Jews, as well in Egypt as in Syria\r\nand in Palestine, and what we have suffered from the Assyrians and\r\nBabylonians, and what afflictions the Persians and Macedonians, and\r\nafter them the Romans, have brought upon us; for I think I may say that\r\nI have composed this history with sufficient accuracy in all things. I\r\nhave attempted to enumerate those high priests that we have had during\r\nthe interval of two thousand years; I have also carried down the\r\nsuccession of our kings, and related their actions, and political\r\nadministration, without [considerable] errors, as also the power of our\r\nmonarchs; and all according to what is written in our sacred books; for\r\nthis it was that I promised to do in the beginning of this history. And\r\nI am so bold as to say, now I have so completely perfected the work I\r\nproposed to myself to do, that no other person, whether he were a Jew or\r\nforeigner, had he ever so great an inclination to it, could so\r\naccurately deliver these accounts to the Greeks as is done in these\r\nbooks. For those of my own nation freely acknowledge that I far exceed\r\nthem in the learning belonging to Jews; I have also taken a great deal\r\nof pains to obtain the learning of the Greeks, and understand the\r\nelements of the Greek language, although I have so long accustomed\r\nmyself to speak our own tongue, that I cannot pronounce Greek with\r\nsufficient exactness; for our nation does not encourage those that learn\r\nthe languages of many nations, and so adorn their discourses with the\r\nsmoothness of their periods; because they look upon this sort of\r\naccomplishment as common, not only to all sorts of free-men, but to as\r\nmany of the servants as please to learn them. But they give him the\r\ntestimony of being a wise man who is fully acquainted with our laws, and\r\nis able to interpret their meaning; on which account, as there have been\r\nmany who have done their endeavors with great patience to obtain this\r\nlearning, there have yet hardly been so many as two or three that have\r\nsucceeded therein, who were immediately well rewarded for their pains.\r\n\r\n3. And now it will not be perhaps an invidious thing, if I treat briefly\r\nof my own family, and of the actions of my own life 28 while there are\r\nstill living such as can either prove what I say to be false, or can\r\nattest that it is true; with which accounts I shall put an end to these\r\nAntiquities, which are contained in twenty books, and sixty thousand\r\nverses. And if God permit me, I will briefly run over this war 29, and\r\nto add what befell them further to that very day, the 13th of Domitian,\r\nor A.D. 03, is not, that I have observed, taken distinct notice of by\r\nany one; nor do we ever again, with what befell us therein to this very\r\nday, which is the thirteenth year of the reign of Cæsar Domitian, and\r\nthe fifty-sixth year of my own life. I have also an intention to write\r\nthree books concerning our Jewish opinions about God and his essence,\r\nand about our laws; why, according to them, some things are permitted us\r\nto do, and others are prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n1 (return) [ Here is some error in the copies, or mistake in Josephus;\r\nfor the power of appointing high priests, alter Herod king of Chalcis\r\nwas dead, and Agrippa, junior, was made king of Chalcis in his room,\r\nbelonged to him; and he exercised the same all along till Jerusalem was\r\ndestroyed, as Josephus elsewhere informs us, ch. 8. sect., 11; ch. 9.\r\nsect. 1, 4, 6, 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\n2 (return) [ Josephus here uses the word monogene, an only begotten son,\r\nfor no other than one best beloved, as does both the Old and New\r\nTestament, I mean where there were one or more sons besides, Genesis\r\n22:2; Hebrew 11:17. See the note on B. I. ch. 13. sect. 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\n3 (return) [ It is here very remarkable, that the remains of Noah's ark\r\nwere believed to be still in being in the days of Josephus. See the note\r\non B. I. ch. 3. sect. 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4 (return) [ Josephus is very full and express in these three chapters,\r\n3., 4., and 5., in observing how carefully Divine Providence preserved\r\nthis Izates, king of Adiabene, and his sons, while he did what he\r\nthought was his bounden duty, notwithstanding the strongest political\r\nmotives to the contrary.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5 (return) [ This further account of the benefactions of Izates and\r\nHelena to the Jerusalem Jews which Josephus here promises is, I think,\r\nno where performed by him in his present works. But of this terrible\r\nfamine itself in Judea, take Dr. Hudson's note here:—\"This [ says he ]\r\nis that famine foretold by Agabus, Acts 11:28, which happened when\r\nClaudius was consul the fourth time; and not that other which happened\r\nwhen Claudius was consul the second time, and Cesina was his colleague,\r\nas Scaliger says upon Eusebius, p. 174.\" Now when Josephus had said a\r\nlittle afterward, ch. 5. sect. 2, that \"Tiberius Alexander succeeded\r\nCuspius Fadus as procurator,\" he immediately subjoins, that\" under these\r\nprocurators there happened a great famine in Judea.\" Whence it is plain\r\nthat this famine continued for many years, on account of its duration\r\nunder these two procurators. Now Fadus was not sent into Judea till\r\nafter the death of king Agrippa, i.e. towards the latter end of the 4th\r\nyear of Claudius; so that this famine foretold by Agabus happened upon\r\nthe 5th, 6th, and 7th years of Claudius, as says Valesius on Euseb. II.\r\n12. Of this famine also, and queen Helena's supplies, and her monument,\r\nsee Moses Churenensis, p. 144, 145, where it is observed in the notes\r\nthat Pausanias mentions that her monument also.]\r\n\r\n\r\n6 (return) [ This privilege of wearing the tiara upright, or with the\r\ntip of the cone erect, is known to have been of old peculiar to great\r\nkings, from Xenophon and others, as Dr. Hudson observes here.]\r\n\r\n\r\n7 (return) [ This conduct of Izates is a sign that he was become either\r\na Jew, or an Ebionite Christian, who indeed differed not much from\r\nproper Jews. See ch. 6. sect. 1. However, his supplications were heard,\r\nand he was providentially delivered from that imminent danger he was\r\nin.]\r\n\r\n\r\n8 (return) [ These pyramids or pillars, erected by Helena, queen of\r\nAdiabene, near Jerusalem, three in number, are mentioned by Eusebius, in\r\nhis Eccles. Hist. B. II. ch. 12, for which Dr. Hudson refers us to\r\nValesius's notes upon that place.—They are also mentioned by Pausanias,\r\nas hath been already noted, ch. 2. sect. 6. Reland guesses that that now\r\ncalled Absalom's Pillar may be one of them.]\r\n\r\n\r\n9 (return) [ This Theudas, who arose under Fadus the procurator, about\r\nA.D. 45 or 46, could not be that Thendas who arose in the days of the\r\ntaxing, under Cyrenius, or about A.D. 7, Acts v. 36, 37. Who that\r\nearlier Theudas was, see the note on B. XVII. ch. 10. sect. 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10 (return) [ This and many more tumults and seditions which arose at\r\nthe Jewish festivals, in Josephus, illustrate the cautious procedure of\r\nthe Jewish governors, when they said, Matthew 26:5, \"Let us not take\r\nJesus on the feast-day, lest there be an up roar among the people;\" as\r\nReland well observes on tins place. Josephus also takes notice of the\r\nsame thing, Of the War, B. I. ch. 4. sect. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n11 (return) [ This constant passage of the Galileans through the country\r\nof Samaria, as they went to Judea and Jerusalem, illustrates several\r\npassages in the Gospels to the same purpose, as Dr. Hudson rightly\r\nobserves. See Luke 17:11; John 4:4. See also Josephus in his own Life,\r\nsect. 52, where that journey is determined to three days.]\r\n\r\n\r\n12 (return) [ Our Savior had foretold that the Jews' rejection of his\r\ngospel would bring upon them, among other miseries, these three, which\r\nthey themselves here show they expected would be the consequences of\r\ntheir present tumults and seditions: the utter subversion of their\r\ncountry, the conflagration of their temple, and the slavery of\r\nthemselves, their wives, and children See Luke 21:6-24.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13 (return) [ This Simon, a friend of Felix, a Jew, born in Cyprus,\r\nthough he pretended to be a magician, and seems to have been wicked\r\nenough, could hardly be that famous Simon the magician, in the Acts of\r\nthe Apostles, 8:9, etc., as some are ready to suppose. This Simon\r\nmentioned in the Acts was not properly a Jew, but a Samaritan, of the\r\ntown of Gittae, in the country of Samaria, as the Apostolical\r\nConstitutions, VI. 7, the Recognitions of Clement, II. 6, and Justin\r\nMartyr, himself born in the country of Samaria, Apology, I. 34, inform\r\nus. He was also the author, not of any ancient Jewish, but of the first\r\nGentile heresies, as the forementioned authors assure us. So I suppose\r\nhim a different person from the other. I mean this only upon the\r\nhypothesis that Josephus was not misinformed as to his being a Cypriot\r\nJew; for otherwise the time, the name, the profession, and the\r\nwickedness of them both would strongly incline one to believe them the\r\nvery same. As to that Drusilla, the sister of Agrippa, junior, as\r\nJosephus informs us here, and a Jewess, as St. Luke informs us, Acts\r\n24:24, whom this Simon mentioned by Josephus persuaded to leave her\r\nformer husband, Azizus, king of Emesa, a proselyte of justice, and to\r\nmarry Felix, the heathen procurator of Judea, Tacitus, Hist. V. 9,\r\nsupposes her to be a heathen; and the grand-daughter of Antonius and\r\nCleopatra, contrary both to St. Luke and Josephus. Now Tacitus lived\r\nsomewhat too remote, both as to time and place, to be compared with\r\neither of those Jewish writers, in a matter concerning the Jews in Judea\r\nin their own days, and concerning a sister of Agrippa, junior, with\r\nwhich Agrippa Josephus was himself so well acquainted. It is probable\r\nthat Tacitus may say true, when he informs us that this Felix [who had\r\nin all three wives, or queens, as Suetonius in Claudius, sect. 28,\r\nassures us] did once marry such a grandchild of Antonius and Cleopatra;\r\nand finding the name of one of them to have been Drusilla, he mistook\r\nher for that other wife, whose name he did not know.]\r\n\r\n\r\n14 (return) [ This eruption of Vesuvius was one of the greatest we have\r\nin history. See Bianchini's curious and important observations on this\r\nVesuvius, and its seven several great eruptions, with their remains\r\nvitrified, and still existing, in so many different strata under ground,\r\ntill the diggers came to the antediluvian waters, with their\r\nproportionable interstices, implying the deluge to have been above two\r\nthousand five hundred years before the Christian era, according to our\r\nexactest chronology.]\r\n\r\n\r\n15 (return) [ This is now wanting.]\r\n\r\n\r\n16 (return) [ This also is now wanting.]\r\n\r\n\r\n17 (return) [ This duration of the reign of Claudius agrees with Dio, as\r\nDr. Hudson here remarks; as he also remarks that Nero's name, which was\r\nat first L. Domitius Aenobarbus, after Claudius had adopted him was Nero\r\nClaudius Cæsar Drusus Germanicus. This Soleus as [own Life, sect. 11, as\r\nalso] by Dio Cassius and Taeims, as Dr. Hudson informs us.]\r\n\r\n\r\n18 (return) [ This agrees with Josephus's frequent accounts elsewhere in\r\nhis own Life, that Tibetans, and Taricheae, and Gamala were under this\r\nAgrippa, junior, till Justus, the son of Pistus, seized for the Jews,\r\nupon the breaking out of the war.]\r\n\r\n\r\n19 (return) [ This treacherous and barbarous murder of the good high\r\npriest Jonathan, by the contrivance of this wicked procurator, Felix,\r\nwas the immediate occasion of the ensuing murders by the Sicarii or\r\nruffians, and one great cause of the following horrid cruelties and\r\nmiseries of the Jewish nation, as Josephus here supposes; whose\r\nexcellent reflection on the gross wickedness of that nation, as the\r\ndirect cause of their terrible destruction, is well worthy the attention\r\nof every Jewish and of every Christian reader. And since we are soon\r\ncoming to the catalogue of the Jewish high priests, it may not be amiss,\r\nwith Reland, to insert this Jonathan among them, and to transcribe his\r\nparticular catalogue of the last twenty-eight high priests, taken out of\r\nJosephus, and begin with Ananelus, who was made by Herod the Great. See\r\nAntiq. B. XV. ch. 2. sect. 4, and the note there. 1. Ananelus. 2.\r\nAristobulus. 3. Jesus, the son of Fabus. 4. Simon, the son of Boethus.\r\n5. Marthias, the son of Theophiltu. 6. Joazar, the son of Boethus. 7.\r\nEleazar, the son of Boethus. 8. Jesus, the son of Sic. 9. [Annas, or]\r\nAnanus, the son of Seth. 10. Ismael, the son of Fabus. 11. Eleazar, the\r\nson of Ananus. 12. Simon, the son of Camithus. 13. Josephus Caiaphas,\r\nthe son-in-law to Ananus. 14. Jonathan, the son of Ananus. 15.\r\nTheophilus, his brother, and son of Ananus. 16. Simon, the son of\r\nBoethus. 17. Matthias, the brother of Jonathan, and son of Ananus. 18.\r\nAljoneus. 19. Josephus, the son of Camydus. 20. Ananias, the son of\r\nNebedeus. 21. Jonathas. 22. Ismael, the son of Fabi. 23. Joseph Cabi,\r\nthe son of Simon. 24. Ananus, the son of Artanus. 25. Jesus, the son of\r\nDamnetas. 26. Jesus, the son of Gamaliel. 27. Matthias, the son of\r\nTheophilus. 28. Phannias, the son of Samuel. As for Ananus and Joseph\r\nCaiaphas, here mentioned about the middle of this catalogue, they are no\r\nother than those Annas and Caiaphas so often mentioned in the four\r\nGospels; and that Ananias, the son of Nebedeus, was that high priest\r\nbefore whom St. Paul pleaded his own cause, Acts 24.]\r\n\r\n\r\n20 (return) [ Of these Jewish impostors and false prophets, with many\r\nother circumstances and miseries of the Jews, till their utter\r\ndestruction, foretold by our Savior, see Lit. Accompl. of Proph. p. 58-\r\n75. Of this Egyptian impostor, and the number of his followers, in\r\nJosephus, see Acts 21:38.]\r\n\r\n\r\n21 (return) [ The wickedness here was very peculiar and extraordinary,\r\nthat the high priests should so oppress their brethren the priests, as\r\nto starve the poorest of them to death. See the like presently, ch. 9.\r\nsect. 2. Such fatal crimes are covetousness and tyranny in the clergy,\r\nas well as in the laity, in all ages.]\r\n\r\n\r\n22 (return) [ We have here one eminent example of Nero's mildness and\r\ngoodness in his government towards the Jews, during the first five years\r\nof his reign, so famous in antiquity; we have perhaps another in\r\nJosephus's own Life, sect. 3; and a third, though of a very different\r\nnature here, in sect. 9, just before. However, both the generous acts of\r\nkindness were obtained of Nero by his queen Poppea, who was a religious\r\nlady, and perhaps privately a Jewish proselyte, and so were not owing\r\nentirely to Nero's own goodness.]\r\n\r\n\r\n23 (return) [ It hence evidently appears that Sadducees might be high\r\npriests in the days of Josephus, and that these Sadducees were usually\r\nvery severe and inexorable judges, while the Pharisees were much milder,\r\nand more merciful, as appears by Reland's instances in his note on this\r\nplace, and on Josephus's Life, sect. 31, and those taken from the New\r\nTestament, from Josephus himself, and from the Rabbins; nor do we meet\r\nwith any Sadducees later than this high priest in all Josephus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n24 (return) [ Of this condemnation of James the Just, and its causes, as\r\nalso that he did not die till long afterwards, see Prim. Christ.\r\nRevived, vol. III. ch. 43-46. The sanhedrim condemned our Savior, but\r\ncould not put him to death without the approbation of the Roman\r\nprocurator; nor could therefore Ananias and his sanhedrim do more here,\r\nsince they never had Albinus's approbation for the putting this James to\r\ndeath.]\r\n\r\n\r\n25 (return) [ This Ananias was not the son of Nebedeus, as I take it,\r\nbut he who was called Annas or Ananus the elder, the ninth in the\r\ncatalogue, and who had been esteemed high priest for a long time; and,\r\nbesides Caiaphas, his son-in-law, had five of his own sons high priests\r\nafter him, which were those of numbers 11, 14, 15, 17, 24, in the\r\nforegoing catalogue. Nor ought we to pass slightly over what Josephus\r\nhere says of Annas, or Ananias, that he was high priest a long time\r\nbefore his children were so; he was the son of Seth, and is set down\r\nfirst for high priest in the foregoing catalogue, under number 9. He was\r\nmade by Quirinus, and continued till Ismael, the 10th in number, for\r\nabout twenty-three years, which long duration of his high priesthood,\r\njoined to the successions of his son-in-law, and five children of his\r\nown, made him a sort of perpetual high priest, and was perhaps the\r\noccasion that former high priests kept their titles ever afterwards; for\r\nI believe it is hardly met with be fore him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n26 (return) [ This insolent petition of some of the Levites, to wear the\r\nsacerdotal garments when they sung hymns to God in the temple, was very\r\nprobably owing to the great depression and contempt the haughty high\r\npriests had now brought their brethren the priests into; of which see\r\nch. 8. sect. 8, and ch. 9, sect. 2.]\r\n\r\n\r\n27 (return) [ Of these cloisters of Solomon, see the description of the\r\ntemple, ch. 13. They seem, by Josephus's words, to have been built from\r\nthe bottom of the valley.]\r\n\r\n\r\n28 (return) [ See the Life at the beginning of the volume.]\r\n\r\n\r\n29 (return) [ What Josephus here declares his intention to do, if God\r\npermitted, to give the public again an abridgement of the Jewish War\r\nhear of it elsewhere, whether he performed what he now intended or not.\r\nSome of the reasons of this design of his might possibly be, his\r\nobservation of the many errors he had been guilty of in the two first of\r\nthose seven books of the War, which were written when he was\r\ncomparatively young, and less acquainted with the Jewish antiquities\r\nthan he now was, and in which abridgement we might have hoped to find\r\nthose many passages which himself, as well as those several passages\r\nwhich others refer to, as written by him, but which are not extant in\r\nhis present works. However, since many of his own references to what he\r\nhad written elsewhere, as well as most of his own errors, belong to such\r\nearly times as could not well come into this abridgement of the Jewish\r\nWar; and since none of those that quote things not now extant in his\r\nworks, including himself as well as others, ever cite any such\r\nabridgement; I am forced rather to suppose that he never did publish any\r\nsuch work at all; I mean, as distinct from his own Life, written by\r\nhimself, for an appendix to these Antiquities, and this at least seven\r\nyears after these Antiquities were finished. Nor indeed does it appear\r\nto me that Josephus ever published that other work here mentioned, as\r\nintended by him for the public also: I mean the three or four books\r\nconcerning God and his essence, and concerning the Jewish laws; why,\r\naccording to them, some things were permitted the Jews, and others\r\nprohibited; which last seems to be the same work which Josephus had also\r\npromised, if God permitted, at the conclusion of his preface to these\r\nAntiquities; nor do I suppose that he ever published any of them. The\r\ndeath of all his friends at court, Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian, and\r\nthe coming of those he had no acquaintance with to the crown, I mean\r\nNerva and Trajan, together with his removal from Rome to Judea, with\r\nwhat followed it, might easily interrupt such his intentions, and\r\nprevent his publication of those works.]",
